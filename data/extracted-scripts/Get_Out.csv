rose,"Really? Like ""Mom, Dad, my black boyfriend is coming up for the weekend""?"
chris,"You said, I'm the first black guy you'd ever dated."
rose,Yeah...?
chris,So this is uncharted territory for them.
rose,"Baby, it's fine. My dad would legit vote for Obama a third time he could. Yes, he will want to talk to you about it, and that will be embarrassing, but they're gonna love you. I promise."

officer crowe, You got a driver's license?
chris,Oh... yeah.
rose,I was driving.
officer crowe,I didn't ask who was driving. I asked him for his I.D.
rose,My boyfriend shouldn't have to show you his I.D. because he hasn't done anything wrong.
officer crowe,"Ma'am, any time there is an INCIDENT--"
rose,"No, fuck that!"
chris,Baby. It's okay--
rose," It's bullshit, and you know it."
officer crowe,"Yeah, I'm all good."

chris, Hey! What's up?
rose,Hi!!!
dean missy,There's my girl! Hello sweetheart.
missy,"We miss you, Ro Ro."
chris,Hi.
rose,"Chris, these are my parents. Mom, Dad, this is Chris."
chris,Good to finally meet you...
dean,Mr. Armitage will do.
chris,Sure.
dean,I got him.  Come here.
chris,Alright.
dean,My wife Missy.
chris,I've heard so much about you guys.
missy,"Yes, you'll do just fine. So handsome."
rose,Can we get inside before you guys start embarrassing me?
missy,"Of course, come inside, make yourself at home."
chris,I'm fine with the embarrassing by the way; go ahead.
chris,Wow.
dean,"""Wow"" is good. We'll take wow."
chris,"I grew up in a one bedroom, so for me, this is ridiculous."
dean,It ought to be. Lord knows we've done enough work on it through the years...
missy, How was the ride in?
rose,We hit a deer.
dean missy,Oh no! Where?
chris,It came out of nowhere.
missy,Are you guys okay?
chris rose,Yeah. Yeah. It just fruck us out.
dean,You know what I say. One down... a few hundred thousand to go.
missy rose,Dean. So awful! Dad.
missy,Let them unload their bags first.
dean,Leave `em. Walter will get `em.
rose,"I think we'll manage, Dad."
rose, You think they wish I was still a kid?
chris,I cannot believe they kept it the same.
rose,So...
chris,They're great.
rose,Yay.
chris,"No, they're totally sweet."
rose,I told you they'd love you.
chris,What?! Is this you?
rose,"""The Crucible."" I was Abigail."
chris,I didn't know you acted.
rose,There's a lot you don't know about me.
chris,"Wait, what about the tour?"
rose,"""The tour?"" Are you serious?"
chris,We just got here. I don't wanna be disrespectful...
rose,Who gives a fuck? Be disrespectful.
chris,I'm serious. Later.
dean,Frankenstein's monster. Only pieces of the original structure remain; I like to think the soul is in tact though.
chris,I've heard stories.
dean,He went through a couple dark spots but came out the other side. You'll meet him later.
chris,"Oh, cool."
dean,Mother and Father lived here till the end. They died a few years ago now. Passed away within weeks of each other...
chris,I hear that happens a lot.
dean,"""Love"" is a powerful thing."
chris,--Owens won in front of Hitler.
dean,You know your history.
chris,Not really. That one always just stood out in my mind.
dean,"Of course. One of those perfect moments. There's Hitler on his high horse with his perfect Aryan race, and here comes this black guy to prove him wrong on the world's stage. What a moment."
chris,"Yeah, tough break for your father though."
dean,He almost got over it.
dean,Okay Snowbell just looking.  Missy's office. This is where she takes appointments.
chris,She's a Therapist right?
dean,Yeah. One of the best in the world. Not a tidy woman.
chris,Like mother like daughter.
chris,And you're a surgeon?
dean,"A neurosurgeon; was. I retired early. Now, I pretty much focus on the house and twiddle my thumbs."
dean,My mother loved her kitchen.
chris,That view.
dean,"Oh, Georgina, this is Chris; Rose's boyfriend."
chris,Hi.
georgina,Hello.-
dean,Ah ha! But now for the piece de resistance...
dean,"Badminton and bocce ball, croquet; we're a family who loves games. Two other families have properties on lake Pontaco, and they're way on the other side. Total privacy."
chris,Yeah?
dean,Well-to-do white family; black servants...
chris,I wasn't gonna go there.
dean,You didn't have to. We hired them a few years ago to help care for my parents; they became part of the family. Couldn't bear to let them go. I hate the way it makes us look though...
chris,Hey. People need work.
dean,Yeah.
missy, Rose tells us your parents aren't with us.
chris,My Dad was never really in the picture. My mom passed away when I was 11; She was hit by a car.
missy dean,"Oh, that's awful; so young. I'm so sorry to hear that."
missy,You two seem like you've been together for years. How long has it been now?
chris rose,4 months? 5 months.
chris,5? She's right; I'm wrong.
dean,`Atta boy Chris. Get used to saying that.
missy,"Not a lot of time, anyway. So...? You guys in love or what?"
rose,Mom.
chris,"I mean, we've been trying to take it slow but..."
missy,Yep. You're in love. I can tell.
dean,Can't resist the inevitable.
missy,"And how did you meet, again?"
chris,At the blood drive.
rose,Remember when I volunteered at the community center?
dean,"Ah, yes."
missy,"And he really is so good looking, isn't he? You'd have beautiful babies."
rose,I know!
dean,Uh oh. Get out of here before it's too late!
rose," Now, all you have to do is just quit smoking."
dean,Oh no! A smoker!?
missy,And we were just beginning to like you.
chris,No. I'm quitting.
dean,You should have Missy take care of that for you.
rose,Oh God.
chris,How?
dean,Hypnosis. Works like a charm.
chris,Oh.
dean,"I thought the whole thing was B.S. too. I smoked for 20 years. She puts me under once, now the sight of a cigarette makes me wanna vomit."
missy,"Of course, I'd give you the service for free. You are family after all."
chris,"Wow. I don't... Thank you. Um, I don't know."
rose,"You guys, normal people don't want strangers fiddling around in their heads."
missy,If you change your mind... We're just glad you could join us for the big get-together.
chris,The get-together?
rose,The party tomorrow? I told you.
chris,I must have forgot.
missy,"Oh, well we host a shindig once a year for our friends."
dean,A tradition. Some of my Dad's old social club. Some old patients. Some just friends...
missy,"Drinks, good food, good people..."
chris,Sounds fun.
missy,Georgina!
dean,Jeremy's home.
jeremy,Who answers the door around here?!
jeremy,"One more... So, let me set the scene. I'm a junior; Ro's a freshman and she has a crush on this guy Connor--"
rose,--No. Mom.
missy,Jeremy...
chris,"No, no... These are good. I wanna hear this."
dean,"Manners, Rose. Give the guest what he wants."
jeremy,"Yeah, Rose."
rose,I hate you.
jeremy,"Connor Garfield was on my lacrosse team. Huge guy, like 6'3"", and crazy, just like ""Looney Tunes,"" right? We had thrown a party--"
rose,You did.
jeremy,I think my parents were in Greece or something. We had gotten into their liquor cabinet and we're all shit-faced.
missy,No you weren't. Were you?
jeremy,"We put water in the bottles so you wouldn't know. Let me finish. Okay, so I'm upstairs in my parents' bathroom hooking up with Jenny Richardson. Hottest girl in our class."
missy,Uch.
rose,"You realize you're coming off like a total douche right now, right?"
jeremy,"Thanks. All of a sudden Connor starts banging on the bathroom door, right? I open it, and he's got blood gushing out of his mouth and he's screaming ""Your thith-ter bit my fuckin' thongue off!!!!"""
chris,"Whoa, what?"
jeremy,"Sure enough, there is a centimeter of tongue meat missing right here."
chris, Ahhhh! You bit him?
rose,"He cornered me and shoved his tongue in my mouth, so yeah."
chris,"Damn. That's badass, Bae."
missy,I'm going to see how dessert is coming along.  Maybe we can change the conversation to something a little lighter.
rose,"Yeah, great story. Thanks for making it totally uncomfortable."
dean,"Okay, new subject. Chris, Yanks or Mets?"
chris,"Ah, Orioles. My mom was from BALTIMORE SO--"
jeremy,You an MMA fan?
rose,Oh God.
jeremy,What?
dean,She's right. Let someone else talk for a bit.
jeremy,You've had your chance. He's dating my sister. I can't bond with the guy?
chris,"You mean like UFC? Yeah, nah. Too brutal for me. I'm a lover, not a fighter."
jeremy,You ever get into street fights as a kid?
chris,Not really. I did take Judo for after-school in 1st grade.
rose,Awww.
jeremy,"Cause, with your frame, your genetic make-up? If you pushed your body, I mean really trained, you'd be a beast."
chris,Cool... Thanks?
missy,What'd I miss?
rose,More ramblings from King Awkward.
jeremy,We're talking about sports.  Stand up. Let me show you something.
missy,No karate at the dinner table.
jeremy,"It's not karate, it's jiu-jitsu."
chris,I've got a rule. I don't play- fight with drunk dudes.
jeremy,I'M JUST--
dean,"--Alright, enough Jeremy!"
jeremy,I wasn't going to hurt him.
rose,And that's my brother.
missy,Quick fix?
chris,Yeah. Nerves got me I guess.
missy,Come. Let's nip this in the bud.
chris,I still don't know if this is right for me.
missy,There really is no need to be nervous.
chris,I'm good. The dude was running out there. Scared me.
missy,Walter starts early every day. He's borderline obsessive compulsive. Tea?
chris,"Nah, I'm good. It'll keep me up."
missy,How's the bed. Good?
chris,Yeah.
missy,Comfortable enough?
chris,"It's perfect, thanks."
missy,Enough sheets?
chris,Yep.
missy,"You watch a lot of Television. Now, you are feeling very sleeepy..."
chris,"Heightened suggestibility. Okay, where do we start?"
missy,Your childhood.
chris,"Yeah, my memory sucks."
missy,"Wounds get locked in your heart and they fester and grow into ugly little things like depression and addiction. But, they are all in there somewhere. All we need to do is find the key."
chris,I guess if it makes me quit... Wait... Has it started--?
missy,--we're going to go back to a place that might be uncomfortable for you. Your Mother's death to be specific. Were you there when she was hit?
chris,I was home. I was watching TV.
missy,Let's go back there. Hear this place. Let the vibrations rush run through your body and ears. Hear it... Find it... Tell me when you find it.
chris,"Okay... Yeah, I found it."
missy,Good. How did you find out she died?
chris,"I knew it. She was never late after work. When she didn't come home, I just knew something was wrong."
missy,Good. Now touch. Feel your surroundings. Feel every part of your body and what you touched. Feel it. Find it... Tell me when you find it...
missy,You said `you knew something was wrong.' What did you do?
chris,Nothing.
missy,Nothing?
chris,I just sat there. Watching TV.
missy,You didn't call someone? Your Aunt or the police?
chris,No.
missy,Why not?
chris,"I don't know. I thought if I did, it would make it real."
missy,Next is smell and taste. Breathe in and let the scent fill your nose. Smell that place. Taste it. Find it.
chris,I found it.
missy,"Good. Now lastly, you must see it. Let the light flood into your eyes. Every color, every detail. See it. See it. Find it."
chris,--Found it.
missy, You think it was your fault.
chris,I don't want to.
missy,It's okay. I'm here.
chris,WAIT--
missy,Sink! Now!
missy,Good. Good. Sink. Sink.
chris,No! NO!!! I'm done! Bring me back! Please!!!!
missy,Now you are in the Sunken Place.
chris, Something's down here...
chris,Damn.
walter,Nothing I don't want to be doing.
chris,Ha!
walter,I know who you are. You're Rose's friend.
chris,"Yeah. That's one way to put it. So, where you from originally?"
walter,She is lovely isn't she?
chris,"Rose? Yeah, she is..."
walter,One of a kind; a real doggone keeper.
chris,"Oh, yeah. Actually, I guess I was pretty drunk. "
walter,And the hypnosis? Did it work?
chris,"Hypnosis? No, I didn't..."
walter,"Well, I should get back to work."
chris,There's another bird...
rose,Hi. Where have you been?
chris,"Out. Taking pictures. Hey, so I think your mom hypnotised me last night."
rose,"Wait, what?"
chris," I think I snuck out for a smoke, and she caught me and offered? I don't know. I must have agreed to it `cause the thing just made me nauseous."
rose,"Okay. Well then that's good, right?"
chris,"No, not good. I can barely remember any of it even happening; I don't like that. Plus I had these fucked up dreams."
rose,That happened to me too.
chris,What did?
rose,"The nightmares. When I was a kid. She hypnotized me once for stage fright, and I had the craziest nightmares, but it worked..."
chris,"And, what's the deal with the help?"
rose,Like... The iced tea thing? Yeah that was weird.
chris,"That, but also the lawn-mower guy creepin' me the fuck out too."
rose,Why? Did he say something?
chris,"It's not what he says, it's how he says it. You know?"
rose,"Yeah, something about them seems... different."
gordon,"Nice to meet you, Chris. Nice to meet you indeed.  Good grip."
chris,Thanks. You too.
gordon,You ever play golf?
chris,"Once, actually; a few years ago. I wasn't very good."
emily,Gordon was a professional golfer for years.
chris,Oh? No kidding.
gordon,"Can't quite swing the hips like I used to though. You know, I met Tiger."
rose chris,"Wow, that's great. Cool."
emily,Gordon loves Tiger.
gordon,"Best I've ever seen. Ever, hands down. Let's see your form."
chris,Me? I could barely hit the thing.
gordon,Show me...
chris,It'd be kind of a waste of time travel though.
lisa, How handsome is he?
rose,Extremely.
lisa,"Not bad huh, Nelson?"
nelson,Eh?
lisa," So, is it true? The love making. Is it better?"
chris,Wow. Um..
lisa, I'm being too forward?
rose,We'll talk later.
chris,"Oh, will you now?"
april,Who even cares about skin color? My God.
chris,Right. I mean--
parker,"The world cares, April. But it's not a question of physical superiority, it's ""What skin color is more culturally advantageous?"""
rose,"""Advantageous?"""
parker,"Fairer skin is has been in favor' the last couple of thousands of years, but the pendulum has swung back again hasn't it..?"
chris,I'm sorry. I'm going to get another drink.
parker,I didn't mean to offend him.
rose,Really? `Cause you have yet to say anything that's not a blanket statement about race.
parker,"Now, Rose.--"
chris,It's good to see another brother around here.
andre,"Yes, of course it is."
chris,Who do you know?
andre,"Why, the Armitage's of course. We're friends of the family."
phil," There you are. Here, put this somewhere."
chris,Chris. Rose's boyfriend.
phil,Fantastic. Logan and I know Rose very well.
andre,"I'm sorry, where are my manners. Logan, Logan King.  Chris was just telling me that he felt more comfortable with my being here."
phil,"That's nice. Logan, I hate to tear you away, dear, but the Wincott's were asking about you."
andre/logan,"Ah, well it was nice meeting you Chris."
chris,Sure.
rose,Where's your drink?
chris,"What? Oh, I forgot."
dean,Hello!
jim,Ignorant shit...
chris,Who?
jim,All of them. Ignorant assholes. They have no idea what real people go through.
chris,I guess people only see what's in front of them.
jim,"Heh. No, you're right. And usually not even that much. That's people."
chris,CHRIS-
jim,I know who you are. I'm an admirer of your work; you have a great eye...
chris,Wait. Jim Hudson... of Hudson Galleries?
jim,The irony of being a blind art dealer isn't lost on me.
chris,How do you do it?
jim,I have an assistant describe work to me. You've got something... The images you capture... so brutally melancholic. Powerful stuff.
chris,"Thank you. Yeah, I just like finding the beauty in abandoned things."
jim,"I used to dabble myself. Wilderness mostly. I submitted to Nat Geo 14 times before realizing I didn't have ""the eye"" for it; Began dealing. And then, of course, my vision went to shit."
chris,Damn.
jim,"I know. Life can be a sick joke. One day you're working in a dark room, and the next day - BAM. You wake up in the dark. Genetic disease."
chris,"Shit ain't fair, man."
jim,Yeah.
jeremy,"Chris, we need you..."
chris,"Yeah, sure.  Nice to meet you."
jim,Stop by the gallery some time. Bout time you had a solo show.
chris,"Really? Wow, okay. Thank you. That would be a game changer."
jim,I think we could do wonderful things together.
jeremy,HA! Come on. You can do better than that!
chris,"Not my game, what can I say."
jeremy,"Yeah, I see that."
rose,Shut up Jeremy.
jeremy,"I'm just saying, if your boy isn't gonna bring his `A' game, we might as well bring Mom up here."
chris,"Whoa, whoa, okay. Now we talkin' smack huh?"
rose,"Yay, baby!"
jeremy,"See, that's what I'm talking about!!! Okay, again!"
chris,Hold up. Here.
rose,Where are you--
chris,I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
rose,Hey! You okay?
chris,The housekeeper unplugged my phone.
rose,I'm sure it was an honest mistake.
chris,"Yeah, or maybe not. Maybe she doesn't like the fact that I'm with you."
rose,Chris...
chris,What? It's a thing.
rose,You think my family's housekeeper gives a shit who you're with? That's crazy bae.
chris,Forget it. Nevermind.
rose,"Look, I get it. This whole thing is stressful. I mean, they're circling you like hyenas down there. I just don't get why you're taking it out on George and Walter."
chris, You're right. I'm being paranoid. I just need a minute and I'll be down.
rose,Fine.
rod,Hey.
chris,Bruh. What's up?
rod,Not much. Sid's chillin'. We eatin' burgers. What's up with you?
chris,Yeah...
rod,Uh oh. That doesn't sound good.
chris,They just got me over here meeting all the family friends. It's like they never met a black dude that doesn't work for them or some shit.
rod,"Oh, they got you on display?"
chris,"Exactly. Also, I got hypnotised last night..."
rod,"Nigga, what the fuck? Oh, Hell no!"
chris,"Yeah, to quit smoking. Rose's mom is a hypnotherapist--"
rod,--Nope. I don't give a fuck if she's Dr. Drew up in this bitch. You ain't getting in my head.
chris, Right.
rod,Who knows what they'll make you do. You know white people into some crazy sex slave shit.
chris,"Yeah, I'm like 99% sure they're not a kinky sex family, but-"
rod,"Why not? Jeffery Dahmer ate niggas' heads, but that was after he fucked the heads."
chris,"And thanks for that image, right there."
rod,"I saw that on A&E, so that's real life."
chris,It's the black people out here that are the weirdest. The help. It's like they're possessed or...
rod,Hypnotised.
chris, HA HA--
rod,I'm just connecting the dots you presenting me with. The mom puttin' trances on niggas and fuckin' them. It's clear as day and that's fucked up. She hot?
chris,What's fucked up is: You're the first line of defense against terrorism.
rod,This is good shit tho.
chris,"Oh, and the one other black guest is like the whitest-most dude at the party."
rod,Send me a picture. You are a photographer. 
chris, Aiight. I'll try.
rod,"And yo, don't say I didn't warn you `cause my ass sure as Hell ain't coming up to the country to save you from no fuckin' witch coven... Unless the mom's hot. She hot?"
chris,"Thanks Rod, bye."
georgina,Hello.
chris,Hi.
georgina,I owe you an apology. I shouldn't be touching things that don't belong to me.
chris,"Oh, no. It's cool. I was just confused."
georgina,"I lifted your cellular phone this morning to wipe down the dresser and it accidentally came undone, see?"
chris,"Yeah, I--"
georgina,"Rather than meddle with it further, I left it that way."
chris,"Really, it's okay. I didn't mean to rat you out."
georgina,"Oh no, no, no, no, no, no... Aren't you the sweetest thing? Not at all. The Armitages are so good to us; They treat us like family."
dean,"Chris! There you are. I wanted to introduce you to some old friends. We'll do it quickly. Down the line: David and Marcia Wincott, Ronald and Celia Jeffries, Hiroki Tanaka, and Fredrich and Jessika Walden."
chris,Too many names to remember but...
hiroki, Can we ask him questions?
dean, Of course.
hiroki,Do you find that being African American has more advantages or disadvantages in the modern world?
chris,"Yeah, I don't know, man."
andre/logan,"My life as an African American has been, for the most part, very good. It's hard to be too specific as I haven't much desired to leave the house in a while."
phil,We've become homebodies...
andre/logan, The chores are my sanctu--
chris,Shit.
phil,Logan?
andre,Get out.
chris,"Hey, man, I'm sorry, I--"
andre,GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!!!
rose,What the Hell was that?
dean,It was a seizure.
rose,A seizure?
dean,Yes. Logan's okay. Missy's with him now. Are you okay Chris?
chris,Yeah. Why did he come at me like that?
rose,"Yeah seizures don't make people attack people, I'm sorry."
dean,"It was an abnormal manifestation but yes, actually, sometimes they do. The flash on your phone must have triggered it."
andre/logan,"Well, I do believe I owe you all an apology."
missy,We're just glad you're feeling yourself again.
andre/logan,Well yes I am. It's quite like being trapped in a dark room and watching my experiences through a window. Thank God you and Dean were here to calm me down.
dean,It's a simple glitch of the brain. Nothing to be afraid of.
andre/logan,I know I scared you all quite a bit.. especially you Chris.
chris,"No, I'm sorry about the flash. I didn't know."
andre/logan,Of course. How could you have?
phil, You shouldn't have been drinking either.
andre/logan,"As I said I'm feeling much better now, but you'll all have to proceed without the aid of my marvellous wit; the whole thing has left me a quite a bit exhausted."
dean,Of course.
andre/logan,It was nice meeting you.
chris,"Yeah, you too."
dean,Let's do sparklers shall we? Brighten the mood?
rose,Let's go.
missy,Anybody need a drink?
rose,We're going on a walk.
chris,My cousin is epileptic. That wasn't a seizure.
rose,Honestly? That was one of the strangest things I've ever seen in my life.
chris,"Also, this is gonna sound weird, but when he got up in my face like that, I got the feeling like I knew that guy."
chris,Let's go back home tonight.
rose,"What? Wait, no."
chris,I'm just... Something doesn't feel right.
rose,You mean with us?
chris,No. With this whole situation! I just... I can't explain but I need you to trust me. Let's just go. It doesn't even have to be a big deal.
rose,It is a big deal. It's my family. I wouldn't even know what to tell them.
rose,"Yes, it's weird. There are a lot of ways I wish this was going different. I wish my brother wasn't a cock. I wish my parents friends were chill; but just because it's tough, it doesn't mean you run away..."
chris,"Baby, I--"
rose,...I'm late.
chris,Late?
rose,I should've got my period like last week.
chris,Oh.
rose,"I mean, I did change my birth control, so it could just be that, but..."
chris,I don't know what to say.
rose,Okay... Try any emotional response whatsoever.
chris,I told you about the night my mom died. How I didn't call 911; didn't go out looking for her.
rose,BABY--
chris,"One hour went by, then two, three... I just sat there... I just watched TV."
rose,It wasn't your fault--
chris,I found out later she had survived the initial hit.
rose,You were just a kid.
chris,"Yeah... yeah. So, I'm not gonna leave here without you. I`m not going to abandon you. Never."
rose,Fuck it. Come on. Let's go back home.
chris,Yeah?
rose,"Yeah. I mean, you're right. This sucks. I'll go back with you. I'll make something up."
chris,I love you.
rose,I love you too.
chris,That was fast.
rose,Yeah.
lisa,Bye Chris! It was a pleasure meeting you. I hope you--
nelson,"Come on, Lisa. Before you say something stupid."
rod,That's Dre.
chris,Dre?
rod,Andre um... Hayworth! Yeah! He used to kick it with Veronica.
chris,Veronica from...
rod,...Teresa's sister! Worked at the movie theatre on 8th;
chris,Yeah. That is him. But...
rod,...But what?
chris,This is so fuckin' crazy. He's different now.
rod,Different? How?
chris,"Different. Slower... I mean he was street; now he's all like... white- seeming. Oh, plus he's gay!"
rod,"No, he ain't."
chris,"I'm telling you: He's gay, I met his man. He's--"
rod,"Chris, you in a fucked up Eyes Wide Shut situation. You need to--."
rose, What are you doing?
chris,Um... Looking for my camera.
rose,Walter can do that.
chris,"Nah, I'll do it."
rose,"I was just looking for them. I'm such a mess, will you help me?"
rose,Chris... What's wrong?
chris,Nothing.
jeremy,Where are you going? The party's just getting started.
chris,I'm going to the car; see if we left the keys in there.
missy,I just made tea.
chris,I'm good.
rose,"Oh, I know where they are. In my bag. Duh."
missy,You're leaving us.
chris,Yeah.
missy,Is something wrong?
chris,"No. Well, yeah... Um."
rose, His dog is not well. He needs to go to the vet first thing in the MORN--
dean,"What is your purpose, Chris?"
chris,What?
dean,In life? What is your purpose..?
chris,"Right now, it's finding the keys."
dean,"We've been looking for our purpose for such a long time. Fire has mesmerized man since the Stone Age. It is a reflection of our impermanence in the world. Fire is born, it breathes and then it dies."
chris,Rose...
rose,I'm looking.
chris,"Rose, what is this shit?!"
dean,"There's a reason we worship the Sun, Chris. He who lights the way through the darkness of life. He in all his glory was around long before us and will be here long after we are gone, but he too will die some day! That's right even the Sun God will die. It is no less mortal than we, but it inspires us to defy it! So what do we do?--"
chris,--Rose.--
chris,I was raised Episcopalian.
jeremy,"Whoa! Be careful, bro."
missy,"Don't hurt him, Jeremy."
jeremy,What? I'm not doing anything.
dean,"Listen, Chris--"
chris,--I don't know what you're saying!
dean, I'm saying that we've found OUR PURPOSE!!! There must be a sacrifice! Sacrifice is essential for the righteous to achieve our true potential. A vessel must be comprised. A host must be born!!!
chris,Rose! The keys!!!
rose,Oh baby... You know I can't give you the keys.
jeremy,Oh shit!
chris,What the fuck?
jeremy,Did you see him drop?
chris,Rose!!!
jeremy,I can take him alone.
chris,"Rose!? No, no, no, no. Shit, shit..."
dean,You're going to drop him.
jeremy,No I'm not.
chris,Rose!!!!
chris,No!! Help!!! Help!!!!! Help!!!!!!
gary,Hey... two strikes. Go take 10; get it together.
rod,"Sup? Making sure you good. I thought you were coming back yesterday, so hopefully you home already and just sleeping or some shit. Aiight. Let me know."
rod,Yeah... me too.
rod,Oh shit.
chris,Hey. Hey!!!! Rose!!!!
detective latoya,...Then he should've gone back up there and made sure everything was accounted for. 
rod,Williams... Rod Williams...
detective latoya,From the TSA?
rod,Yes Ma'am.
detective latoya,"You know that TSA issues should be brought to your authorizing officer, right?"
rod,"It's not TSA business, ma'am."
detective latoya,"Please don't call me ""ma'am,"" or we're not gonna get along. How can I help you, Rod Williams from the TSA?"
chris,Here it is: My boy Chris has been missing for two days.
detective latoya,Your son is missing?
rod,"No, sorry, not my son, my boy. He's my friend. He's 26. His name is Chris... Washington..."
detective latoya,That's four days ago.
rod,"Yeah, I mean he's only been MISSING for two days. He was SUPPOSED--"
detective latoya,--I'm gonna stop you right there. Now you know the minimum amount of time without contact before you can file a missing persons report IS--
rod,"--Three days I know, but I have reason to believe he's been abducted."
detective latoya,Go on.
rod,Chris was set to come back home on Sunday. I was watching his dog Sid.
detective latoya,That's Sid.
rod,Yup. Cute right? Now look...
detective latoya,Don't look too missing to me.
rod,"Well that's the thing. We found him and now, according to Chris, he's gay with a different personality."
detective latoya,Gay?
rod,But he didn't used to be.
detective latoya,I think he might just argue with you on that one.
rod,I know what I'm about to say is gonna sound crazy.
detective latoya,Try me.
rod,You ready for this...? I think this family is abducting black people and brainwashing them to work for them as sex slaves and shit... Sorry.
detective latoya,...Brainwashing?
rod,Yeah.
detective latoya,Hold on one second.  I want you to tell these officers exactly what you just told me.
rod,"...See, I don't know if the hypnosis makes you a slave or if just turns you gay or what, but they already got two brothers that we know of, and who knows how many more there could be."
latoya," So, I don't want none of you sayin' I don't do nothin' for you... White girls'll get ya every time!"
chris,Is this the only song you got?
chris,"Okay. Okay! What do you want? You tryin' to break me? I won't say shit!! I'll just... I'll do what you say, just answer me!"
rose,Hello?
rod,"Yo. Um, Rose? It's Rod."
rose,Hi.
rod,Where's Chris?
rose,He left like two days ago.
rod,He left?
rose,We got in a fight. He got all paranoid and flipped out; He took a cab home. He forgot his phone. Wait... You haven't seen him?
rod,No. He never made it back here.
rose,Oh my God.
rod,I've been calling. I went to the police and everything.
rose,What did you say?
rod,I told them he was missing.
rose,Uh huh...
rod,So... What cab company did he use?
rose,"I don't know. A local one I'm guessing. Maybe uber? Wait, I'm so confused..."
rod,Hold on a second.
rose,"Rod, just stop."
rod,Huh?
rose,I know why you're calling.
rod,Why is that?
rose,"Come on. I mean, it's kind of obvious."
rod,What?
rose,That there's something between us.
rod,No. I'm calling about Chris.
rose,We'd all go out drinking... I remember you looking at me.
rod,That's my best friend. If you did SOMETHING--
rose,"I know you think about fucking me, Rod."
rod,--No. You crazy... No.
chris,"...Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall, all you need to do is call. And I'll be there. You got a friend. Ain't it good to know you've got a friend. Ain't it good to know you've got a friend. Oh, yeah, yeah, you've got a friend."
jim,Hello Chris. How's it going...? You can answer. There's an intercom in the room; I can hear you.
chris,I need water.
jim,"Yeah, sorry about that. If it makes you feel any better, I'm thirsty too."
chris,I need to get outta here.
jim,"Right. So, the reason I am talking to you now is so you can understand what is happening to you. I guess your `understanding' it raises the success rate of this whole thing. Not even sure I `understand' it."
chris,Where's Rose?
jim,"Hot isn't she? Hot voice anyway, you dirty dog. You're one of the lucky one's. The son Jeremy's wrangling method sounds way less pleasant."
chris,Is this some kind of a game to you?
jim,"They asked me for my favorite song, which was hard; I like all types of music. Turns out they really just needed one I knew all the words to: I went with James Taylor's ""You Got a Friend."" I hope it hasn't been too torturous; that wasn't the point. The point is that you learn it, and for us to have that knowledge in common."
chris,Who the fuck are you people?
jim,"Oh right. Okay, let me back up and give you the cliff notes. The Armitages and I are a part of a society. A pretty extraordinary society actually. "
chris,You hypnotize me? Break my will..? Make me a slave like the others? This is some crazy racist shit.
jim,"No. Not racist, Chris. We don't hate you. We want to be you... You are not going to be a slave. You're going to be a vessel."
chris,"Wait, what?"
jim,"Missy's hypnosis was merely to sedate you. Oh, that and to prepare you psychologically..."
chris,For what?
jim,For the procedure.
chris,What's the procedure?
jim,Are you ready...? Drum roll please. Brain transplantation. Some say it could never be done;
chris,What the fuck?
jim,"Dean's the only guy who really gets the science. He's the one who discovered that full brain transplantation isn't actually necessary to transfer the soul, and that partial brain transplantation solves the little nerve ending problem."
chris,No.
jim,"Okay so... You see the blue part? That's the piece of your brain that's all rooted in the nervous system. So that stays; keeping those tricky little connections intact. The rest is discarded. Then they'll remove the red part of my brain from my skull and put in yours. Your ""blue"" and my ""red"" basically absorb each other. And apparently the brain heals surprisingly fast, so assuming everything goes as planned, we should be up and functioning in a couple weeks."
chris,And my brain?
jim,"Your red part? It'll be discarded, but don't worry. You wont be gone. Well not completely. You'll still be in there somewhere; limited consciousness of course;"
chris, ...The Sunken Place.
jim,"Yes. That's what she calls it. Good! So you understand, I'll control the motor functions, the will of our body, effectively MAKING ME--"
chris,Me... You will be me.
jim,"As far as the world is concerned. It's still a pretty new operation. Some kinks. We're supposed to stay away from flashes of light for example. They can trigger a ""momentary lapse in control of motor functions..."""
chris,Why black people?
jim,"Well, because you get the highest bids. For the last decade or so anyway. I wish it was less simple than that, but it's not. You're in fashion, baby!"
chris,That's crazy.
jim,Take it as a compliment.
chris,You're not going to get away with this.
jim,"We have and we will. We'll be together soon, brother."
chris,"No, No--"
rose, Wait. Wait. Chris!.... Chri-
chris,Shhhh.
dean,Saw...
dean,Jeremy...?
tutorial,I seem to have misplaced my passport. Je crois avoi egare mon passeport.
911 operator,"911 emergency, I'm at the home of Dean and Missy Armitage--"

chris,Look in the basement!
rod,I really need to...
chris,...I don't remember...
rod,...impress on you the importance of remembering some of those names. The fire didn't leave ENOUGH--
chris,I don't remember.
rod,"You gotta help me out, Chris. Secret societies doesn't get you very far on Google. I'm over here feeling like I'm playing connect the dots on a fucking football field. One name..."
chris,I don't remember.
rod,"Well, try again please."
chris,Rod.
rod,Let's start at the beginning; walk me through it again.
chris,Rod.
