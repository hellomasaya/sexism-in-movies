lazarus,These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
rae," Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?"

rae, The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
lazarus," I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want."

rae,"WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!"
lazarus,God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
rae,You some kind'a pervert?
lazarus,No ma'am.
rae,"Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me..."
lazarus,"In my house, you watch that lip..."
rae," Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!"

lazarus,Whose doin' is that?
rae,Okay... OKAY! I'M COMIN' IN! NOW QUIT IT!
lazarus,Say we talk. Just take a seat on the sofa. I'll get us somethin' cool to drink.
lazarus,"You may not remember. But you spent a whole half day in my tub, tryin' to cool down. Melted four ice trays."
lazarus,Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
rae,"You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!"
lazarus,Think I'm gonna let you do me like that...
lazarus, Now take that look out'cha eye.
lazarus,"No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness."
rae, Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
lazarus,I said... STOP!
rae, I CAN'T!
rae,Hmmmmmm... Stop-it!... STOP-IT!
lazarus,You hungry?
lazarus,I put some back ache into growin' them greens. You should slow down and see how they taste.
rae,You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
lazarus,Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
rae, If I break one you gonna shoot me?
lazarus,"My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?"
rae,Uh-uh.
lazarus,Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
rae,Itches.
lazarus,"Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?"
rae,Uh-uh.
lazarus,"The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand."
rae,I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
lazarus,"Gal... Matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story...  Ya gotta cut this shit out. Got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. Like you somebody's dog. No woman... who joins in union with Almighty God... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to ANOTHER MAN'S WILL!"
lazarus," I GOT SIN IN ME! I AIN'T GO'N LIE! BUT I GOT RESPECT! AND ALL YOU GOT IS BILE, GAL!"
rae,Let go of me...
lazarus,GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...!
rae,GET OFF ME!
lazarus, Didn't mean to go off on a tear like I did. I just got to thinkin' about things...
rae,"Why is it you old men gotta talk so much? Like little boys, gotta talk yourself into fuckin' me.  You wanna give me 'nother bath?"
rae, Goddammit.
gene,There goes our fortune. We been doin' good for ourselves since you been away.
lazarus,Y'all know when Ella Mae's open up?
archie,You needin' to buy some pantyhose?
lazarus,Just some dresses.
rae,Hello? Hey!
rae,I don't believe this shit.
rae,Enough to choke a Goddamn horse.
lazarus,"I'm needin' some women's clothes. A few dresses. Maybe some shoes. But they gotta be nice. They gotta be proper. Clothes a woman would want, where she could feel and look like a woman without... you know, lookin' like a tramp or a hussy or somethin'."
ella mae,"And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?"
lazarus," That young lady's size, right'cher."
ella mae,"Well, that makes it easier."
ella mae,Well... I hope these will work for your niece. She can always come back in and swap sizes.
lazarus,"Mind I ask, what's all this business here?"
ella mae,These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
lazarus,For your hands?
ella mae,Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
lazarus," I'll take a jar of that, too."
lazarus,Lookin' for Miss Angela.
girl,She in the back.
angela,Wait right there.
lazarus,"I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans."
angela, You didn't have to do this.
lazarus,"Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank."
angela,Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
lazarus,Look here. I got somethin' special for you.
lazarus,This here is a whipped... body cream. And it's got a smell to it. Tell me what you think.
lazarus,They call this Ginger Souffle. Best if it... if it go on your skin just after you been in a hot tub... or shower.
angela,This was very sweet of you.
lazarus,Well. Hope you enjoy it.
girl,Oooooo.
angela,Hush up.
red,You gonna be on the square later on?
lazarus,Got all my honey-do's done with. I'm headin' home.
red,Stay cool. It's a hot one.
red,"Yes'sir, Rev'rend."
rae, You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are gray. You'll never know dear how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away. A voice from outside spins her around. The guitar barks as Rae slams it down on the table.
lincoln,Mister Laz... I come for the butter beans.
lincoln,"Ain't seen you on the square. Mister Laz, can you hear me?"
lincoln, Mister Lazarus?
lincoln,"Mister Laz, I'm comin' inside..."
lazarus,SHIT BOY! WHAT THE HELL YOU...!
lazarus,CAN'T LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR ONE...
lazarus,"Lincoln, come on back."
lazarus,He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
lazarus,"R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place."
lazarus,This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
lazarus,"You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time."
lazarus,You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
lazarus,Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
lazarus,I told you to TURN BACK!
rae, I didn't want to.
lazarus,Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
lazarus,"I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home."
lazarus,"I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this."
lazarus,"Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby."
lazarus,Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
lazarus,Go in and talk to her. Please.
lazarus,Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
lazarus,"You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit."
lazarus,Watch y'self in there. That girl'll jump on ya junk like a grasshopper.
lazarus,Did I hurt'chu?
lazarus,What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
lincoln,Why she got a chain on her?
lazarus,That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
lincoln, Please don't tell my daddy.
lazarus,"My mouth is shut, boy. And that's how we gonna keep it. Don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?"
lazarus,So...  That your first time?
lincoln,Yes'sir.
lazarus,"You struck some gold, didn't ya?"
lazarus,"Shit. My first time was with my second cousin behind my uncle's barn. She weighed two tons, if a pound. Could'a done a lot better for myself. You sho'nuf did."
rae,Thank you.
rae," You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me."
rae,You a preacher?
rae,"Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven."
rae,But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
rae,"You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch."
rae, Ronnie.
ronnie, Rae. I really need you to... come find me. Please.
lincoln,We gonna eat with her?
lincoln,She still gonna have that chain on?
lincoln,I ain't no virgin no more?
lazarus,Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
rae,Uh-uh.
lazarus,"Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?"
rae,I don't fuckin' cook.
lazarus," Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you..."
rae,"Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a..."
lazarus,If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  You know how to boil water?
rae,I can handle that.
lazarus," Well, get to it."
lazarus,Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
lincoln,I skipped lunch.
lazarus,"Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat."
lazarus, Ask the chef.
rae,Cayenne pepper.
gill, Holy shit.
ronnie, Yeah.
gill,"Sit down, man. Need a beer?"
ronnie,Sure.
gill," Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here."
ronnie,"Hey, Herman."
herman,They buy you that big chicken dinner?
gill,What?
herman,"They got little names for everything in the corps when they trying to get rid of ya. Don't know what it's like in the guard. There's what you call a bad conduct discharge, a BCD... we all called it the big chicken dinner. It ain't the brig but it'll fuck ya for life if you wantin' to work for the government."
ronnie,That's not what this is about.
herman,They got another little name called ad-sep. That sound about right?
herman,Ad-sep. Administrative separation.
gill, How do you get one of those?
herman,"Blowin' boys in the head, for one."
herman,"Whoa, son! I ain't sayin' shit about you. I'm just talkin'."
ronnie,"Well, you don't know what you're talking about so why don't you shut the fuck up?"
gill,"Hey, it's alright, man. It's alright.  Herman. Come on. He just got back."
herman,To get back ya had to've gone somewhere.
gill,What happened?
ronnie,"They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  It's a long process but... they sent me home."
gill,I guess it could be worse. You could be comin' back in a body bag.
ronnie,I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
gill,She's around. Always is.
ronnie,"I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?"
gill,You been home yet?
ronnie,Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
gill,You need a ride?
ronnie,Rae?
ronnie,"This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it."
gill,She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
ronnie,"I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see how she could get scared...  ...and run."
gill,"Drink. Come on, drink some."
ronnie,"Her momma works down at the grocery, down on the square. Maybe she seen her."
gill,Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
ronnie,"That's not right, really, cuz I..."
gill," You joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. Army'd pay for school. You were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself."
gill,And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
ronnie,Now wait...
gill, With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
ronnie,"I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible..."
gill,YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
ronnie,"It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her..."
gill,"The only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  Your first night away, I come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. You weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. Like she was havin' some kind'a fit."
gill, I don't care if that hurts you or not. Truth is I don't know who you are anymore. So fuck it.
gill,You gonna steal my truck?
ronnie,Make yourself at home. You done it already.
lazarus,I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
lazarus,Not like that.
lazarus,"She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other."
lazarus,I'm through with them both.
rae,They sure liked them devilled eggs.
lazarus,You drink whiskey?
lazarus,You take it straight?
rae,Sure.
lazarus, To my baby brother. Gonna be a daddy.
rae,"Well, that's good news. So you're gonna be someone's uncle."
lazarus,Want another?
rae,We drinkin' buddies now?
lazarus, To freedom.
rae,Still makin' jokes?
lazarus, No joke.
lazarus,"Not my place to change your mind, or anybody else's. People gonna do how they please. You only get one life... should be lived the way you wanna live it."
lazarus,If you want... I can take you back to town now.
rae,I ain't in a hurry.
rae,Could you do somethin' for me?
lazarus,Anything.
lazarus, Ain't played 'fore nobody in years.
lazarus, Funny how a sound just speak to ya heart.
lazarus, They's this one spring... I saw a change in her. Her breasts start swellin' up. Come a few mornings I hear her heavin' in the bathroom. I seen it with women before. I knew.
lazarus,"Come a day, Rose say she had to go visit her folks in Jackson. Didn't want me to come... so I stayed put.  They talk about a woman havin' that glow. Couldn't see it no more. She... took it away. Cut it out."
lazarus,"One night... While she sleepin'. Held a pillow in my hands. I could see myself killin' her. What evil in my heart make me wanna kill her, I don't know? It's that voice in me. Each time I think it's gone, he come howlin' back. Devil or no, I don't know. But I am a haunted man."
lazarus,"Calls me when I'm ailing. When I can't find my home, lost in the pines. I calls it the Black Snake Moan.  Mm-mm... Got no momma now.Mm-mm... Got no momma now.It's over late last night, don't need no momma now."
rae,"Sing, Lazarus.  Please keep singin'."
lazarus, Mm-mm... Black snake crawlin' in my room.Mm-mm... Black snake crawlin' in my room.Some pretty momma better come and get this black snake soon.
lazarus," Black snake is evil, black snake is all I see.Black snake is evil, black snake is all I see.Woke up this mornin', black snake moved in on me."
lazarus,My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
rae,I'm here with you.
lazarus,I had love in my heart. And I gave it to one woman. And she gone now.  Where am I gonna put all this love?
rae,You can give it to me.
rae,You can't start this and not finish. Not with me.  Please...
lazarus,"Wait... I gotta stop...  Dammit, Rae... GET OFF!"
lazarus,This ain't the way for me. I'm sorry.
rae,"Not gonna lie to you, Laz...  This one's a doozy. I don't think... I don't think I can stop this."
lazarus,Tell me what to do.
rae, The... chain helps.
rae,I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
lazarus,You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
rae,"He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!"
rae," Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times."
lazarus,No one's gonna hurt you no more.
rae,You think God forgives people like that?  You think God forgives people like me?
rae,Hold me. Oh God...
lazarus,We'll just stay here. Wait till it passes.
rae,Where you gonna be?
lazarus,Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
rae,"I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff."
lazarus,This town ain't goin' nowhere. You take the time you need.

rae,Got in a little accident.
sandy, Yeah.
rae,"Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want."
sandy,You need money again?
rae,"No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got."
sandy,You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
rae,"Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?"
sandy,"I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?"

rae,"I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all."
sandy,The hell are you talkin' about?
rae,"Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma.  And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had."
rae,I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
sandy,"All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that."
rae,But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
sandy,Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.

ronnie,"You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?"
lazarus,"Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back."
lazarus,"Ain't that easy, is it? I been in some scraps, son, I know. First there's that loud crack. Always louder than you think. Like it just come-up- a-cloud and clapped a mess thunder right in ya hand. BAM!"
lazarus,"White light. Smell of smoke. Taste of my blood and brains in your mouth, stingin' ya eyes."

rae,"I got you, baby... I got you..."
rae, DAMMIT LAZ PUT THE PHONE DOWN?
lazarus,"Thought you knew me better, gal.  I need you at my house... right now."
ronnie,I hate this town. You can't round the corner without bumping into someone who's got your number.  But... when Rae gets like she does. And she does the things that she always done. Makes me feel like she loves this place more'n me.
ronnie,"All my life people called me shit like, sissy and... nervous and... I got few things in my life that make me feel like... like..."
lazarus,Like a man.
ronnie, Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
rae,"It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else."
rae,"I think... I think we're fucked up. Both of us. I know I am. But... that don't mean what I feel ain't true. It don't mean I can't love. And I know, how I been is... is... REALLY BAD! So if you want to quit on me... I understand. But please... please... don't."
angela,Hey.
lazarus,Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
angela,What do you need?
lazarus,I need ya help again.
angela,More cough syrup?
lazarus,Can I come in?
lazarus,I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
angela,Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
lazarus,"Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away."
angela,"Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?"
lazarus,I do. God's truth. I do.
angela,Now what'chu need me to do? Cuz I'm gonna go do it.
tehronne,"Yo, this here Pinetop. I think he got what you lookin' for."
lazarus,That'll do.
tehronne,"It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus."
lazarus, Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
tehronne,Nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. And you know what? I'm good at it. Naw what I mean?
angela,What are you doing?
ronnie, Just wanted to see.
angela,"You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?"
ronnie,"Yeah, I know."
angela,Then start taking them seriously.
ronnie,"Yes, ma'am."
angela,"It's okay to breathe, honey."
rae,"Yes, ma'am."
lincoln,You Ronnie?

lincoln,Gotta do it like this or I get all turned around.
angela,She's ready for you.
lazarus,"Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?"
rae,I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
lazarus,"Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?"
rae,I want to. More'n anything. But I...
lazarus,"Now... let's stop that.  You and me... we can handle this. You hear me, gal? We gonna be just fine. Now live ya life. Pull your shit together and live your life."
rae,Okay.
rae,I don't want you to let go.
lazarus,Maybe I won't.
lazarus,I do.
lazarus,You got her now?
