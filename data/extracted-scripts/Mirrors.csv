Speaker,Dialogue
fourth draft,January 5th 2007
angela,What time is it?
angela,"No, you're going to be late."
ben,"Go back to sleep... I'll call you, OK?"
angela,"Yeah, I won't be working until later tonight."
ben,"See you later, Angie."
ben," I've been thinking about Michael's birthday tomorrow. It would be nice if we could celebrate it together ... You know, for the kids' sake... Call me... Please."
ben,Did you clean them?
lorenzo,What?
ben,"The mirrors, why are they so clean?"
lorenzo,"That's Gary Lewis, the fellow who worked here before you. He was completely obsessed with these damn mirrors. He'd spend the entire night polishing them."
ben,Why did he leave?
lorenzo,No idea. Just didn't show up one night. I take it he's found a better opportunity somewhere else. 
lorenzo,"Lorenzo Junior, my grandson... Say hello Lorenzo."
lorenzo,Lorenzo and I are going to the movies tonight...
ben,"How old are you, Lorenzo?"
ben,I do now.
ben,I think your grandpa just wants to scare you a little.
lorenzo,"Here, this should fit you. Lorenzo, put your coat on... We are already late.  There's a drop of Jack Daniel's in the cupboard... To keep yourself warm."
ben,See you tomorrow.
ben,Fuck...
michael,"Why did they say on TV that it wasn't supposed to snow today, but tomorrow instead? Why did they lie?"
daisy,"Sometimes they make mistakes, Michael. It happens..."
michael,Grown-ups don't make mistakes. Only little children do.
daisy,Daddy!
michael, What is that?
ben,"Well I don't know, I just found this package hidden behind a tree."
michael,Is it for me?
ben,"Maybe...  Daisy, has Michael been a good boy? Does he deserve his birthday present?"
daisy,No! Yesterday he finished the whole bag of candy when mom had told him he could only have one piece.
michael,Not true!
daisy,Yes it's true!
michael,"No, it's not true... She's lying Daddy. I've been a very good boy, I promise."
ben,Is mom back?
daisy,Not yet. Rosa came to pick us up from school today.
ben,Hello Rosa!
rosa,Hello Seor Carson. How are you?
ben,"I'm good, very good... What time will Amy be back?"
rosa,"Not before six, Sir..."
ben,"OK, I'll wait for her."
rosa,Do you want me to fix you a snack?
ben,"No, thank you. I'll be fine."
michael,What is it?
daisy,"Duh, open it stupid!"
amy,Hi Rosa... Where are the kids?
rosa,Upstairs...  ...With Seor Ben.
ben,Hey Amy...
amy,"It's great, you will have to show me how it works!"
ben," Ok kids, it's time for your bath. No fooling around."
amy,"What is this? I already asked you not to drop by without calling, didn't I?"
ben,"I do, but you never take my calls!"
amy,I don't need your calls in the middle of the night. I'm better off without them.
ben,"I haven't had a drink in three months but, then again, how would you know?"
amy,"I don't want to know, Ben. I don't want to hear about it. It's not my problem. You're not my problem. You've done more than enough harm already."
ben,You don't think people can change?
amy,"We are not talking about people, we're talking about you. How many times did you tell me you were gonna change and nothing happened? It only got worse."
ben,Just give me another chance.
amy,"I need more time, Ben. Listen, I will never stop you from seeing your children but we have to set up some rules."
ben,"WHAT RULES?! IT'S MY SON'S FUCKING BIRTHDAY TODAY! COME ON AMY, WHAT RULE IS GOING TO STOP ME FROM SEEING HIM?"
amy,"Yes, honey."
amy,I don't know sweetheart. I don't know.
ben,I haven't managed to find the source of the leak. My guess is it doesn't come from the store... It must be a municipal pipe that blew with the cold...
lorenzo,I'll call the company tomorrow morning and have them come take a look at it.
angela, What are you looking at?
ben,Nothing special...
ben,You can't avoid them. They're everywhere...
angela,What are you talking about?
ben,"The mirrors... In the department store, at every street corner, in the windows of every fucking building in this city. I feel like I'm not the one looking into the mirrors, but rather they're looking at me."
angela,You need a drink.
angela,Don't you think you're being a little bit paranoid?
ben,Gary?
ben,Coming...
deliveryman,"Mr. Carson?  Would you mind signing here, please?"
lorenzo,I've just been through the craziest day here... No kidding! Your ex- colleagues came to pay us a visit...
ben,What happened?
ben,Did they mention the cause of death?
lorenzo,No... they wouldn't tell me.
ben,"Have a good night, Lorenzo."
31.,54   CONTINUED:                                                       54
ben, Damn... What is happening to me?
ben,"Amy, I need you to do me a favor..."
amy,"Listen, I am in the middle of work, I don't really have time now."
ben,"I need your help... It won't take more than twenty minutes. Please, Amy?"
amy,Why do you want to see him?
ben,"He used to work at the Mayflower as a night watchman, before I replaced him."
amy,Where did you get his driver's license?
ben,I found his wallet in the department store. I need to find out how he died...
amy,"You are no longer a cop, Ben. This isn't your business anymore."
ben,"He sent me a package before he died, with newspaper articles about the Mayflower... I think he was trying to tell me something... I don't know him. I've never even met him, Amy... I need to figure this out."
young doctor,"Gary Lewis... Gary Lewis... Oh, there he is, 58B... He slashed his throat..."
amy, There you go... There's your answer. Your man committed suicide.
young doctor," Well, all I know is that the cops are still investigating this one. That's why we still have the body. People can be very creative when it comes to suicide. I'm sure it's not the craziest thing you've seen."
amy,"I've got to get back to work, Ben. They're waiting for me upstairs."
ben,How... What did he slit his throat with?
young doctor,With... with a piece of mirror.
gary,...ESSSEKERRR...
amy,"Are you OK, Ben? What's going on?"
ben, I need to see his files...
amy,What?
ben,I NEED TO SEE HIS FILES!
amy,"Come on, Ben, what is it you're after? I am not supposed to show you any file... You're not even allowed to be here. I could get fired for this."
young doctor,"Well, I'll be off. Amy, you know where to find me if you need me."
amy,"What is happening to you? What is all this supposed to mean? What is going on, Ben?"
ben,I won't leave until I see that file.
ben,"Look at this picture... Come and see, Amy."
amy,What!?
ben,"Look at the piece of mirror in his hand. In the reflection of the mirror it's covered in blood, and look- in reality, it's clean. Not a drop of blood..."
amy,So what?
ben,Don't you find it strange that this mirror doesn't reflect an exact image of reality?
amy,I can't see the difference. It must be an effect of the angle from which the photograph was taken. What is it you are you trying to prove?
ben,What if the mirrors were showing us something different?
amy,"What? For Christ's sake, listen to yourself, Ben! What are you talking about?"
ben,What if the mirrors were reflecting something that goes beyond reality?
amy, OK... This is way over my head. I don't have time for your barfly theories.
ben,Thanks for your help...
amy,"You should go home and get some rest. This guy probably just killed himself because he couldn't live with himself anymore. It happens to thousands of people, you know..."
angela,"I'm off... Amy called me today, she's worried about you. What's happening, Ben?"
ben,"I made a deal, Angie... I can't just walk out on them like that. I need this job, I need the money. I'm not going to sleep on your couch for the rest of my life!"
angela,"You won't have any trouble finding another one. A daytime job, a regular job..."
ben,LEAVE ME ALONE...
ben,"Mrs. Lewis... Sorry to bother you... My name is Ben Carson. I worked with Gary, at Mayflower. Could I come up and talk to you for a few minutes?"
ben,Did he use any drugs?
ben,"Did you notice anything different, the days prior to his leaving the house, anything unusual in his behavior?"
ben,What kind of changes?
ben,Sleeping?
ben,Busy doing what?
ben,Is that you standing next to him?
ben,"Mrs. Lewis, I found a note that Gary wrote. "
41.,"60   CONTINUED:  A piece of paper, where he'd scribbled down the name, Esseker... Does that mean anything to you?"
ben,May I see his room?
ben,Do you mind if I stay in here for a moment?
ben, WHERE ARE YOU?!!
michael,Mom! Mom!
amy,What is it Michael?
michael,There's a lady screaming...
amy,Where Michael?
michael,There... In the mirror...
amy,"No, Michael... Look, there's nothing there."
michael,I saw her mom. I swear I did.
amy,"It was just a nightmare. It's late, you have to go back to sleep. I'll turn on the night-light, if you want."
daisy,"Mom, can you leave the door open?"
amy,"Sure sweetheart... OK, you two go to sleep now."
angela,Hello... Ben?
angela,"No, no, I just got home from work. What's wrong? You sound strange."
angela,Are you sure?
angela,Are you sure?
angela,Be careful... Love you.
police inspector,Look... Isn't Ben Carson in the picture?
49.,"67   CONTINUED:                                                     67 LARRY  The person who did this must have had the keys to her apartment, or otherwise it was somebody she knew..."
amy,"He would never have laid a finger on her. When their father died, Ben took care of his sister. Angela meant the world to him."
amy,"No, lately, communication hasn't quite been our strong point...  I only found out yesterday that he was staying at his sister's. What are you going to do with him?"
amy,"You have to see someone Ben. You cannot stay in this situation any longer. You need help, psychological support."
ben,"No, I don't want to put them in any danger."
amy,What do you mean?
amy,"Ben, look at me! I don't want you to get into any trouble. Think about Daisy and Michael. You are not going to solve this case. Please, stay out of it."
amy,"In that case, you have to tell them everything."
ben,They wouldn't believe me and neither would you... Goodbye.
amy,"Ben, wait..."
ben,Why did you do it? WHY? WHY DID YOU HAVE TO KILL HER?
esseker, CUT TO:
ben,"...Look up Esseker... Yes, Echo, Sierra, Sierra, Echo, Kilo, Echo, Romeo... Esseker. No idea, my guess is that it's a name... No, I haven't got a first name. Yes, in New York. Over the past five or six years. I know it's hazy but that's all I've got. I already looked it up in the phone book. I also called someone at the IRS and at the DMV, but nothing there. It's very important Larry. You'll call me back? Ok..."
amy,Do you want the cereal in your hot chocolate or in a separate bowl?
michael,In the chocolate...
amy,"...In the chocolate, please, mom..."
michael," ...Please, mom."
daisy,"Yuck, that's gross, how can you eat that?"
amy,"Come on, come on, let's get going, or you're going to be late for school."
daisy,Mom?
amy,What is it sweetheart?
daisy,Do you know that Michael has a new friend?
michael,"No, that's not true!"
amy,"Really, what's his name?"
michael, You promised not to tell.
amy,Does he go to your school?
michael,He doesn't want me to talk about him.
amy,Why doesn't he want you to talk about him? Is he a grown up?
michael,No...
amy,"So, he's a little boy your age, then?"
daisy,He lives in the mirror in our room.
amy,Is it your father who told you that?
michael,No Mommy.
ben,Did you consider Terrence innocent?
59.,76   CONTINUED:                                                     76
terrence,"In order to... to destroy the mirrors. Only fire can destroy a mirror, isn't that right, Doctor?"
terrence,They killed Helen and my three little girls...
terrence,Because I didn't...
terrence,They asked me to find Esseker...   Like they did with the others...
ben,Amy...  I have to go.
terrence,"I DON'T KNOW WHO ESSEKER IS! I DON'T KNOW WHO ESSEKER IS, I DON'T KNOW!!"
daisy,What are you doing dad?
ben,"Don't worry, there's nothing wrong. Everything is OK..."
daisy,But why are you doing that?
ben,I'm doing it to protect you.
amy,Do you mind telling me what the hell you're doing?
ben,"Look Amy, you've got to trust me, I know what I'm doing... It's for your own good."
amy,I want you to stop what you're doing and get out of our house right now. 
62.,80   CONTINUED:                                                     80 AMY  You're scaring the kids acting like this.
ben,"You have to trust me Amy, I'm not completely crazy... These mirrors are dangerous. At first, I thought it was only the ones at the store, but now I know they can get you anywhere. They got Angela... I promise I'll leave the house once I've taken them all down."
amy,"Do you realize what you're saying, Ben? What is wrong with you? I know that what you're going through isn't easy. Angela was a part of our lives too, but you have no right to do this to us... Ever since your obsession with these damn mirrors the kids are scared to death. Your son has nightmares. He's scared Ben... Your behavior is starting to rub off on him. He's only 5 years old... And I have to protect him."
ben,"Come Amy, come with me, I want to show you something."
ben,"Look, you'll see..."
amy,"What are you doing with that gun... Put it down, BEN... PUT IT DOWN RIGHT NOW!"
ben,"Wait, look, you'll see..."
amy,"SEE WHAT, BEN?! WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SEE ?!"
ben,But... I swear to you I... I saw...Amy...
amy,"Get out...now! I don't ever want to see you here again, Ben. And I'll have the lawyers make sure the same goes for the kids. You are insane, Ben, and dangerous... You've got to get help."
ben,"Hello, Larry? It's me... I'm going to need your help again-"
ben,Mayflower used to be a hospital before it became a department store. St. John's Hospital. Do you have any idea where all the medical records could have ended up after it closed down?
ben,Go to the city hall archives... They must have something considering it was a public hospital.
ben,"Larry, Larry stop it... If I could go myself, I wouldn't be asking you. Go to the City Hall archives, and ask them to look up Esseker among the former patients. Please."
ben,"Please, do it for me."
ben,"Talk to you later.  Ben hangs up.  He glances back at the rear view mirror and sees ANGELA'S CORPSE, SITTING ON THE BACK SEAT!  Startled, he loses control of the vehicle. A truck approaches at full speed in the opposite lane. He barely avoids the collision.  Two other cars appear. Ben zigzags in and out, just barely avoiding a fatal crash.  He stops along the edge of the road.  Ben closes his eyes and rests his head against the steering wheel in an attempt to clear his mind. He looks up into the rear- view mirror again-  ANGELA'S REFLECTION IS STILL THERE. Behind her long black hair, she fixes him with a milky gaze.  Ben flies into a rage. HE SMASHES THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR WITH HIS BARE FIST, REDUCING IT TO SCRAPS...  Ben is alone and lost.  BEN  What have I done? I don't understand... What have I done?  Insert on what is written on the side rear-view mirror-  ""OBJECTS IN MIRROR ARE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR"""
larry,He was arrested. They found him dead on the first day of his hearing. He had slit his wrists with a piece of his cell mirror!
amy,"Come on, come on... Let's go... Daisy, Michael?"
amy,"What are you doing Michael? Come on, we're going to be late."
ben,Amy ? What's wrong?
ben,What?
ben,What's happening?
ben,Where are Daisy and Michael? Are the kids all right?
ben,Get out of the house. I'll be right over...
ben,"I'm right here, Amy. I'm here now... Thank god you're alright."
amy,"We can't stay here, we have to leave the house now... We can go to my mother's or to a hotel..."
daisy,"When will you be back, Dad?"
ben,"As quickly as I can, sweetheart. I promise."
michael,"I love you, Dad."
amy,What if you don't find her? Maybe she doesn't live there anymore? Maybe she's really dead.
ben,"They want her, I'm gonna find her wherever she is. We don't have any other choice."
amy,I know.
ben,"Amy, I want you to stay here with the kids until all this is over. All the mirrors are covered, there's no more danger. I'll come back as soon as I can."
ben,Hello... Is this the Esseker farmhouse?
woman's voice,What is it Jimmy?
jimmy,I don't know Mom.  What can I do for you sir?
ben,"I am looking for Anna, Anna Esseker."
jimmy," Anna Esseker, Mom!"
jimmy's mother,What is it you want with Anna Esseker?
ben,"I huh... I am doing some research for a book on the history of St. John's Hospital, in New York..."
jimmy's mother,"Jimmy, go tell grandpa that there's a man here who'd like to talk to him about his sister."
robert,"You know, up to this day, the visions of Anna's fits still haunt me at night."
robert,"No, not with Anna..."
ben,With the mirrors?
ben,Where is she now?
robert,"To protect us, she left the house and joined the monastic orders, where mirrors are forbidden... St. Augustine's monastery, on the road to Midwich."
sister,"Yes, how can I help you?"
ben,Hello Sister. I have come to visit a member of your community... Sister Anna? Her real name is Anna Esseker.
sister,Is she expecting you?
ben,"No, not really."
sister,Are you a relative?
sister,"If you are not listed, I cannot help you sir. "
79.,"104   CONTINUED:                                                    104 SISTER  We have strict regulations concerning visitations, which are exclusively for family members."
sister,Wait here for a moment.
sister anna,St. John's closed down in 1952. Who are you?
ben,"My name is Benjamin Carson. I work as a night watchman at 1229 West 38th Street in New York City, what used to be St. John's Hospital."
sister anna,What is it you want Mr. Carson?
ben,I need your help.
sister anna,My help? I don't quite see how I could possibly be of any help.
ben,My wife and children are in danger. What is threatening my family is asking for you...
sister anna,"It is not the wish of the mirrors to find me, but of what is imprisoned inside them. The mirrors are merely windows on our world..."
ben,A window... For what? For whom?
anna,"At the time that I was at St. John's, Dr. Kane's therapy for personality disorders consisted of locking the patient up in a mirrored room for several days on end, in order to force him to confront his own image. I spent the darkest days of my life in that room. On the 6th day the nurses found me lifeless, almost dead. Since that day, I have never had another fit. But deep down inside I've always known the truth."
ben,What truth?
anna,"There is no cure for schizophrenia, it was something else, Mr. Carson. And whatever it was, it entered the mirror."
anna,"The consequences of such an act, Mr. Carson, would be more devastating than letting them suffer where they are now. I'm going to pray for you and your family. That's all I can do right now, Mr. Carson. God bless you..."
ben,"Wait... Please, listen to me- Terence Berry, Gary Lewis and many others before me... Those are the people who died trying to find you. Because they failed, their families died too. My sister was murdered two days ago... My wife and kids will next if you don't come with me. Look-  From his wallet Ben takes out a wrinkled photograph of Michael, as a baby, in Amy's arms. Daisy stands next to them in the picture. Ben presses the photograph against the grating for Anna to look at it.  BEN  I KNOW YOU ARE SCARED OF GOING BACK THERE. IT'S EASIER TO KEEP HIDING BUT THIS IS NOT THE HOUSE OF GOD ANYMORE. WHILE YOU'RE PRAYING PEOPLE ARE DYING ON YOUR TIME!  Anna doesn't respond and disappears in the distance.  Ben failed. He's desperate and lost. He has a hard time containing his anger."
daisy,What is it Mom?
amy," No Amy, stay with me..."
ben,"Amy? Amy? Answer me?  He tried to redial but that doesn't work. He knows something weird is happening there.  Without hesitation, Ben grabs his gun inside the car and walks back towards the monastery gates."
anna,"If I come with you Mr. Carson, you have to promise to do everything I tell you. My way. No questions."
ben,You have my word.
amy,"Micha...  She turns around, but Michael is not behind her. The reflection lied.  SUDDENLY HER ARM IS PULLED INTO THE BATHTUB.  AN INVISIBLE FORCE PLUNGES HER HEAD INTO THE WATER TO DROWN HER. AMY STRUGGLES FRENETICALLY BUT THE PRESSURE IS TOO STRONG FOR HER TO BREAK FREE."
amy's reflection,"Come sweetheart... Come, come closer... Come..."
daisy,"What are you doing in there, Mom?"
amy's reflection,"Come closer, don't worry... Everything is all right, sweetheart."
amy,Michael?! Michael?
amy,"Oh my god, don't move baby, don't move..."
daisy,"Why did you do this, Mom?"
amy," It wasn't me Daisy, it wasn't me... I would never hurt you, you know that."
daisy,Whe...where is Michael ?
amy,"I don't know where he is... I'm going to take care of you and then we're going to find him...OK But for now, we have to get out of here."
daisy,Is Daddy coming back soon?
amy,"Yes, he'll be here soon as he can."
amy,Listen to me carefully Daisy... I want you to stay in here and be quiet.
amy,Michael ? Michael ?
michael,"They want to come play with us, Mommy."
amy,"Michael, I want you to drop that knife, do you hear me? You know very well you are not allowed to play with that, don't you?"
ben,Answer! God damn it... Answer the phone...
ben,"Something's wrong over there, my wife is not answering."
anna,They are waiting for me...
amy,Michael ?
daisy,"Tiger! Come here kitty, come here..."
ben,"Watch your step, a water pipe has burst, the whole basement is flooded."
amy,Michael ?
daisy,"It is over, Mom?"
amy,"Yes sweetheart, it's over..."
