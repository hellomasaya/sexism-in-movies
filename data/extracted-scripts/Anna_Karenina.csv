Speaker,Dialogue
written by, Tom Stoppard
agafia,He needs to come in if he's to wash himself.
levin,"Good girl . . . good girl, Pava."
kitchen maid, Agafia Mishaylovna says dinner's like to spoil.
levin,. . . her father's colour.
vasili,"Worth coming home for, Konstantin Dmitrich!"
levin,I stayed too long in Moscow.
levin,. . . She's a beauty. That's twelve cows sired by Berkut!
agafia,So one of you is doing what the good Lord made you for.
matvey,What should I do with this?
oblonsky,Where did you find it?
matvey,In your hat. Your Excellency.
oblonsky,Yes . . . I picked it up somewhere for Daria Alexandrovna and the children.
dolly,"Bonjour, Lili; bonjour, Masha; bonjour, Grisha; bonjour, Tanya."
anna,"Tsk, oh . . . Stiva!"
anna,. . . and Dolly found a note from the governess.
anna,Stiva wants me to come to Moscow . . . to persuade Dolly to forgive him.
karenin,I'm to be deprived of my wife so that adul- tery may be forgiven? I can't excuse him just because he's your brother.
anna,It's for Dolly's sake too.
karenin, I have four committees today . . .
anna," Tsk-tsk, who put this shirt on you? Never mind. I'll come and hear you read."
karenin,"Tomorrow, perhaps. Thank you, Lukich-- perhaps tomorrow."
anna,"Alexei, do you think nine years of mar- riage and children should count for nothing against a . . . an infatuation?"
karenin,"No. Very well.  But sin has a price, you may be sure of that."
dolly,You think of the children! Their lives are ruined now!
oblonsky,"Oh, Dolly . . . I beg you . . ."
matvey,Telegram. Should I send up the barber?
oblonsky,"No, just the razor."
oblonsky, My sister Anna's coming tomorrow. We're saved.
doorkeeper,"Some man came without an appointment, Your Excellency . . . waiting outside."
oblonsky,Levin! Where did you disappear?
levin, I'm very anxious to see you. I need your advice.
oblonsky,I've been hard at it. Sit down.
levin,Hard at what exactly?
oblonsky,"Why, we're overwhelmed with work!"
levin,Oh--paperwork.
oblonsky,Paperwork is the soul of Russia. Farming is only the stomach. When am I going to come and shoot some snipe?
levin,Yes. I'm in love. I've come back to propose. Have you guessed who she is?
oblonsky, I have a suspicion. Why didn't you propose when you were here?
levin,"I decided it was impossible. Kitty is of the heavens, an angel, and I am of the earth-- but then I thought and thought, and . . . there's no life for me without her! . . . Do I have a chance?"
oblonsky,Of course you do. The Shcherbatskys are giving a soiree this evening. Get there early before the crowd. If I may suggest . . .
levin,Anything! What?
oblonsky,New boots.
levin,Right. Anything else?
oblonsky,"No--five-thirty at l'Angleterre--I owe them more than the Hermitage, so it wouldn't be fair to withdraw my custom.  Boots, and a coat. And a proper hat."
oblonsky,"It's so unfair. You marry for love, you're a good husband. Children arrive. Years depart. And all of a sudden your wife is tired, her hair is thin, her body . . . while you yourself still have your . . . vigour . . . and you find yourself distracted by a pretty woman . . ."
levin,"Forgive me, but I find that incomprehen- sible . . . As though I'd leave this restaurant and steal a roll from a baker's shop."
oblonsky,"Well, you know, a freshly baked roll . . ."
levin,"But I'm talking about love, and you're talk- ing about . . . your appetite."
oblonsky,"Easily confused. Now look, do you know Count Vronsky?"
levin,Who? No. Why?
levin, Who is he?
oblonsky," You don't have to worry about him. He's one of those rich, good-looking cavalry offi- cers who've got nothing to do but make love to pretty women . . ."
elderly waiter,"Potage aux choux a la Russe, as the gentle- man ordered."
levin,It's what I wanted.
levin,Dolly said that? I've always thought your Dolly's a gem.
oblonsky,"Oh, she is, she is . . .  I loved her to distraction."
serozha,But why?
serozha,But why?
anna," I told you, Serozha. She's not well. I must go to see her."
serozha,But why?
anna,"Now, don't make Mama cry. I'll be back before you know, and bring you a present."
serozha,Don't want a present. I want you to stay.
anna,Oh . . . my little Kutik . . .
serozha,What present?
anna,That's better.
anna,It's the first time I've left my little boy.
countess vronsky,So you are leaving your son and I am return- ing to mine. I am Countess Vronsky.
countess vronsky,But you know my name?
anna,I've heard you mentioned . . .
countess vronsky,"Talked about, you mean. Ah, love!"
anna,Was it love?
countess vronsky,Always. My sons are ashamed of me. But I'd rather end up wishing I hadn't than end up wishing I had--wouldn't you?
anna,I . . . I don't know . . .
levin,I'll come back.
kitty,Konstantin!
levin,I'm too early.
kitty, No! Come up!
kitty,Look at me! I'm receiving for Papa and Maman who are late to dress. It's my first reception.
levin,"Princess Ekaterina! Delighted, delighted!"
kitty," I'm so pleased you were able to be with us, Konstantin Dmitrich!"
levin, Kitty . . . you look . . . you look--
kitty,Stiva told us you were back. How long are you staying?
levin,I don't know. It depends on you.
kitty,On me?
levin,What I mean to say--I came with only one purpose--I want to--will you be my wife?
kitty,I can't. I'm sorry.
levin,Yes. It was impossible.
burisov,Burisov. Are you the brother of Nikolai Levin?
burisov,"He's in Moscow, he's staying at the Unicorn in Khitrovka."
levin,How do you know?
burisov, It's the sort of thing I know.
levin,Count Vronsky?
vronsky,Yes.
levin,It's Kostya.
levin,Nothing. I came to see you.
levin,"Good evening, miss . . . madame . . ."
nikolai,"Don't talk to her like that. It frightens her. You sound like a magistrate.  More vodka for my brother, quick about it."
levin,I don't want anything.
nikolai,I'm all right.
levin,A colonel in the Third Department. They're watching you.
nikolai,Good. They must think I'm dangerous.
levin,Nothing.
nikolai,That's right. The day is coming. I gave up my birthright for it. You're on the wrong side of history. Not because privilege is immoral but because it's irrational.
masha,He is sick.
nikolai,Let go or I'll beat your lights out.
levin,No.
nikolai,Why not? Are you waiting to fall in love?
levin,No.
nikolai,Good. Romantic love will be the last illu- sion of the old order. You should marry one of your peasants.
levin,Yes. I damn well should!
nikolai, The brotherhood of man.
levin,"Nikolai, you have to see a doctor. Then come and stay with me at Pokrovskoe till you get your health back."
levin,If you . . . or go abroad to a spa. I'll send you more if that's what you . . .
stationmaster,The private coach will stop opposite the carpet.
guards officer,Austrian royalty on their honeymoon. I've got them for four days.
vronsky,Bad luck. What do they like? Art?
guards officer,Food.
vronsky,Here's the train.
stationmaster,I'll see to it.
major domo,"Second carriage, Your Excellency. I'll see to the Countess's luggage and bring it on to the house."
anna, You don't look ashamed.
oblonsky," I am, I really am."
countess,"Charmante, don't you think?  Wait for me in the carriage. I'll take Tosca."
vronsky,. . . You stayed longer in St. Petersburg.
countess vronsky,"Long enough for you to start a little love affair, I hear."
vronsky,"I can't think what you're referring to, Maman."
anna,"There, Countess, you have found your son and I have found my brother."
countess vronsky,"Madame Karenin has a son, too. It's the first time they have been apart, so she frets about him."
vronsky,Excuse me for not recognizing you before.
countess vronsky,We passed the time telling each other about our sons.
anna,"Yes, I've been hearing all about you."
vronsky,That must have been very boring for you.
anna,"Au revoir, Countess."
countess vronsky,"Au revoir, my dear. Let me kiss your pretty face."
vronsky,Keep your people inside until this has been cleared up.
oblonsky,". . . the sole support of a large family, they say."
vronsky,"Wait for me, Maman."
countess vronsky, I've you to thank for that.
oblonsky,What a good fellow . . .
anna,Have you known Count Vronsky long?
oblonsky,Did you like him? He's in love with Kitty.
anna,Oh . . .  But we should be discussing you and Dolly.
oblonsky,"I've said it all--on my knees--in tears . . . Now I need you to say it. I'm going to the office, so you'll have Dolly to yourself."
anna, Don't be home late.
dolly,"Kitty's coming by to see you. She's all grown-up, and a bit frightened of you--the belle of St. Petersburg society!"
anna,Is that who I am?
anna," I know, I know."
dolly,"I can't bear to be with him. And he doesn't care, he's got what he wants."
anna,"What he wants is you. He loves you, Dolly. You and the children are everything to him."
dolly,Are we? And there is room for a governess?
anna,"That was shameful, disgraceful. But it was not love. It was the animal in man, not the soul. Stiva's remorse is from the soul."
dolly,What about me? Does his remorse make it easier for me?--
anna,"I know you are suffering. But, Dolly, you must tell me . . . is there enough love left in your heart . . . enough to forgive him?"
dolly,"When I think of them together, I can't for- give him, no!"
dolly,My fate?  But I haven't done anything! It's him WHO'S--
anna,"Do you love him, Dolly?"
kitty,"Will you stay for the Bobrishchev's ball, Anna?"
anna,Oh . . . I always feel dull at a ball.
kitty,How can you ever be dull?
oblonsky,Of course she must.
anna,. . . and God go with you.
oblonsky, You can introduce me to your new governess.
tanya,She's old! She's a hundred!
anna,I know why you want me to come. You want everyone to be there because you're sure it's going to be your night.
kitty,How did you know?
anna,I know everything.
servant,". . . no, Your Excellency . . . He's just gone up. . . . The Princess retired early . . . Is there a message?"
vronsky,No.
levin,Will you go to confession?
serafina,"And you also, master. He is watching."
levin,"God forgive us then, for committing the act of love."
levin,"""Not according to my deserts, O Lord, but according to thy mercy""--that's a fine prayer. But I'm full of doubt. Sometimes I even doubt that God exists."
serafina,How can there be anything if God didn't make it?
levin,I don't know. One day science will tell us.
serafina,That's sinful talk if the priest heard you.
levin,"Well, I won't go to confession."
serafina, Your father built the church. You're con- fessed a while yet.
levin,What would you like?
youth,Kitty! May I have a waltz?
kitty,"You may, Boris. I'll save you the third just because it's your first ball."
youth, You're my first conquest.
kitty,There.
korsunsky, So that your ankles may be seen.
kitty,"How are you, Stiva?"
oblonsky,"Thanks to Anna, I am a happy man. Would you like to dance?"
kitty,"No, ask Anna."
prince shcherbatsky,". . . this vile, idiotic matchmaking of yours . . ."
princess shcherbatsky,"For goodness' sake, what have I done?"
prince shcherbatsky,Levin is a thousand times better than this Petersburg fop. If he had royal blood my daughter wouldn't need him!
kitty,Is anything the matter?
kitty," Don't ask me, Maman!"
countess nordston,"He'll dance the mazurka with Kitty, you'll see. I call the mazurka the now-or-never."
austrian princess,. . . we were shut up in the train for an hour!
vronsky,Dance with me.
anna, I am not used to being spoken to like that by a man I met once at a railway station.
vronsky,"I dare say, but if I'm not to dance with you, I'm getting out of this operetta and going home."
anna,"Then, for Kitty's sake."
countess nordston,You're not dancing the mazurka? I won't have it.
korsunsky,. . . the lady chooses a lady and a gentleman . . . !
guard,Bologoye! Fifteen minutes.
vronsky,Can I be of service to you?
anna,I didn't know you were . . . Why are you leaving?
anna,"This is wrong. If you're a good man, forget everything that happened, as I will."
vronsky,"I'll never forget a single thing about you, not a word, not a gesture--"
anna,That's enough!
vronsky,Take the luggage home.
anna, Is Serozha all right?
vronsky,Did you have a good night?
anna,"Yes, quite comfortable. Count Vronsky."
karenin,I have to get back to the Committee . . .
anna,"I? Oh--Dolly and Stiva . . . yes, I think so . . ."
vronsky,I'll announce myself.
petritsky,"Vronsky! The master himself. Baroness, coffee from the new coffeepot for Count Vronsky."
baroness,I'll be off home if I'm in the way.
baroness,"Ah!--Pierre, you never say such pretty things to me. We were just discussing my husband. He won't divorce me, you see. And do you know why?"
vronsky,No.
baroness,Because he likes eating off my family silver.
vronsky,Ah.
baroness,"I want to bring an action. Just because I'm supposed to be unfaithful, I don't see why I have to eat off Pierre's crockery. Look at it."
vronsky,It's my crockery.
petritsky,How was Moscow?
vronsky,Provincial.
serozha, You've stopped.
anna,Sssh . . .
karenin,Time for bed!
anna,I'm writing to Dolly . . . and to Kitty.
karenin,You are . . . good.
karenin,What are they saying in Moscow about the new Statute?
anna,What new Statute?
karenin,The new Statute I carried in Council.
anna,No one mentioned it.
karenin,Ah. Really?
family doctor,"Forgive me, Princess, but I must . . ."
prince shcherbatsky,Am I the only one who knows what's wrong with her?
princess shcherbatsky,"Oh, thank God, doctor--my friends say you're the only one who can save her!"
celebrity doctor,"Possibly, Princess, possibly! At your service, Your Excellencies. Where is the patient?"
celebrity doctor,"Come, come, Princess, we are not backward people--I handle naked bodies every day. Deep breath now . . ."
prince shcherbatsky,By God. I'll challenge the scoundrel!
family doctor,It's the modern way . . .
princess shcherbatsky, You're not a doctor!
family doctor,"Her symptoms . . . loss of appetite, fast PULSE--"
prince shcherbatsky,"Well, whose pulse wouldn't be fast if some brute of a--"
prince shcherbatsky,"Don't you fret, my little Kate! You'll wake up one fine morning and say to yourself--""I feel well and happy and I'll go out for a walk with Papa!"""
betsy,I want to give a small dinner before the opera. Is there anyone you would like me to ask?
anna,"Yes . . . Yes, the Metropolitan Bishop of St. Petersburg."
anna,"The last one was to meet a missionary, the one before was for a lecture on the union of the Greek and Roman churches.  I'm sorry--I know you're fond of her. Come on, or we'll be late."
demin,"Here's the thing, Vronsky. A posting has come up and there's a promotion in it for you."
vronsky,"Thank you, sir."
demin,The garrison in Tashkent.
demin,I don't mind. But your mother . . .
betsy,You didn't come to my dinner.
vronsky,I had to see my Commanding Officer.
lydia,. . . work never ceases for great men.
anna,I'm expected at the Tverskoys.
lydia,"No doubt, but I'm sure Princess Betsy can wait for you, my dear."
anna,"Yes. In fact, I think I won't go to Betsy's."
betsy,You're caught.
vronsky,I'm afraid I am becoming ridiculous.
lisa merkalova,"Now, there's a phenomenon, look-- Anna's shadow has arrived before Anna!"
anna's friend,I'm Anna's friend . . . but this making-up- one's-mind-to-it in public is not polite to a distinguished man like Karenin.
princess myagkaya,"In my opinion Karenin is a fool, and Anna is the best of us."
betsy,Alexei . . . You look desperate. That's not attractive.
vronsky,I'm losing hope.
betsy,Hope of what? Persuading a virtuous woman to break her marriage vows?
vronsky,And how is Tuskevich?
betsy,"That's not attractive either. Besides, I was never virtuous."
vronsky,No--you're right. She won't come. I'm going home.
vronsky,Turn round!
voices,"Wasn't Nilsson glorious? One sees that she has studied Kaulbach, of course . . ."
betsy,He's gone. But you're just in time for the surprise.
anna,I would prefer to try a cigarette.
anna,Thank you.
vronsky,When?
anna,"Just as I was thinking your manners have improved since Moscow. You behaved badly, very badly."
vronsky,And who was responsible for that?
anna,Give me a cup of tea.
betsy,How nice--Alexei Aleksandrevich has arrived.
lisa merkalova,I'm not sure my nerves can stand another Alexei at this moment.
princess myagkaya,"So the Schuzburgs asked us to dinner. The sauce was said to have cost a thousand rou- bles, and it was ghastly. We had to ask them back. I gave them a sauce that cost eighty- five kopeks and it was a triumph."
vronsky,Were you glad to see me or not?
vronsky,What do you want me to do?
anna,I want you to go to Moscow and beg Kitty to forgive you.
vronsky,"No, that's not what you want. Moscow? I can do better than that. Tonight I refused a posting to Tashkent. I can change my mind, and you'll never see me again."
anna,"If you have any thought for me, you will give me back my peace."
vronsky,I have no peace to give. There can be no peace for us--only misery or the greatest happiness. You are my whole life now.
betsy,Your husband is impossible!-- his opinions are all wrong but he talks so brilliantly he wins every argument.
karenin,I called to take you home.
anna,"No, I'm staying. Send the carriage back for me."
karenin,Of course.
vronsky,Do you want me to go to Tashkent?
vronsky,So I'll go to Tashkent.
anna,No. I don't want you to go.
anna,Waiting up? How unlike you!
karenin,"Yes, I stayed up to talk to you."
anna,What about? It's late. Where's Annushka?
karenin,I sent her off.
anna,"Well, if you want to talk, but we should go to bed."
anna,Warn me? It's really rather late . . .
karenin,"I wish to warn you that you may inadver- tently, by indiscretion and carelessness, give the world occasion to talk about you."
anna,I am not a committee. Please say what you want to tell me.
karenin,You and Count Vronsky attracted attention tonight.
anna,"You don't like it when I don't talk to people, and you don't like it when I do."
karenin,"I didn't notice anything, myself. But I saw that everyone else noticed. I consider jeal- ousy to be insulting to you and degrading to me. I have no right to inquire into your feelings. They concern only your conscience. But I'm your husband and I love you. It's my duty to remind you that we are bound together by God, and this bond can only be broken by a crime against God."
karenin,And you have a son.
karenin,"Forgive me.  If I am wrong, I ask your pardon."
anna," I don't know what you're talking about, and it's really too late for this. Excuse me, please."
anna, Too late.
anna,"Oh God forgive me. It's the end of everything--I've got nothing left now, only you. Remember that."
vronsky,Anna . . . Anna . . . how can I not remem- ber? You're my happiness.
levin,I thought that had been done.
vasili,I gave the order. What can you do with these people?
oblonsky,Ah--potage aux choux a la Russe!
levin,Of Babylon? No.
oblonsky,"You're right, what do you care? You love the country--you've got it. You love agricultur- ing, and, Lord knows, you've got it. You love shooting--you've got it. You've got every- thing you want!"
levin,"All right, go on, then. Have you stopped stealing bread rolls?"
levin,"So, nothing new to tell me. How is--how are the Shcherbatskys?"
oblonsky,You mean Kitty.
levin,I . . . Is she engaged now?
oblonsky,No. Vronsky went back to St. Petersburg.
levin,"Oh yes, as if I had time in the summer! And I've got extra land this year at Kashin for the haymaking."
oblonsky,"Kashin? That's on the Ergoshovo road, isn't it? Won't you call when Kitty is there?"
levin, Especially not then. I humiliated myself once.
levin,Her heart told her no. Did you come to shoot snipe or criticize me?
levin,"For you, getting married is . . . a social engage- ment. Not for me. For me, it's the condition of personal happiness and living the right way. I'll never again be carried away by passion. I renounce it. I'll have to find another way . . ."
oblonsky,Look out--here they come!
dolly,"There. Oh, I'm sore with his feeding! Would you like to hold him?"
kitty,I have no troubles.
dolly,"That man wasn't worth the tears, believe me."
kitty, I don't care about him. I don't even think about him. Or her. Except to hate her.
dolly,Then we'll never speak of it again.
kitty," What has Levin got to do with it? Anyway, I'll never get married. The whole business of . . . it's become disgusting to me . . . and look what it's done for you! Why do they call it love?"
dolly,Because it's love.
anna,I want you to. I don't care about it.
vronsky,You should care. You're not supposed to.
vronsky,Everybody. Doctors.
anna,You're squeamish. You a soldier! Would you faint?
vronsky,"Anyway, someone might be watching."
anna,But I'm damned anyway.
vronsky,I'm not. I'm blessed.
anna,You love me.
vronsky,Yes.
anna,Only me.
anna,Apart from Frou-Frou.
vronsky,Yes.
anna,But me more than your horse?
vronsky,Yes.
anna,Are you happy?
vronsky,Yes.
anna,And you love me?
vronsky,Yes.
anna,How much?
vronsky,This much.
vronsky,Yes.
anna,This much?
vronsky,Yes.
anna,This much?
vronsky,Yes.
anna,This much? And this much? And this much?
vronsky,Yes.
anna, And . . . this . . . much . . . ?
karenin,Countess . . . I thought you would be at Peterhof now.
lydia,I've come from there. I'm distressed that you haven't taken your usual house this year.
karenin,Anna wanted a change. She is spending the summer at Tsarskoe.
lydia,Near Princess Betsy. And . . .
karenin,"Oh, is this about my wife?"
alexander,"Alyosha . . . a message from Maman. Her friend Princess Sorokina has a house here, and a virgin daughter, that's not part of the"
demin,Gentlemen--I give you--the regiment!
alexander,I heard you turned down a promotion.
vronsky,That was Maman interfering.
alexander,"Yes. And now she's come up with a princess for you.  Alexei--we're brothers, so don't take offence. Getting married puts the pack on your back--it leaves your hands free for climbing the ladder. Getting serious about a married woman is like carrying your pack in your arms."
alexander,An assignation?
vronsky,"Come on, I'll introduce you."
alexander,Beautiful. A man would come to no harm. Do you think you'll win tomorrow?
vronsky,"Makhotin's Gladiator is favourite, sixteen hands--Frou-Frou looks dainty beside him, but she's got heart. Haven't you, my darling?"
anna,"Alexei, what is it?"
vronsky,I couldn't bear not to see you before the race.
anna,I'm pregnant.
vronsky,Ah . . . My love.
anna,"How can we, Alexei?"
vronsky,Tell Karenin everything.
anna,Do you think my husband will make you a present of me?
vronsky,Leave him.
anna,Leave him and be your mistress?
vronsky,Yes. Run away.
anna,I would never see my son again. The laws are made by husbands and fathers.
vronsky,"What, then? I'll never forgive myself for your unhappiness."
karenin,"How are you, young man? Your tutor doesn't seem to be in evidence. We'll have a look at your lesson books."
anna,Alexei!--you got away at last. Can you stay?
karenin,Why . . . ?
karenin,"Races, surely. No, I'll come on later, and then I must get back to town."
countess vronsky,Exquisite creature . . . you really ought to be the spoil of victory today . . .
oblonsky,Princess! A bet! What do you fancy in the next?
betsy,Kusolev.
oblonsky,I'm on Vronsky. A pair of gloves?
anna,Alexei . . . !
karenin,I'm here.
anna,Stiva! What are they saying?
oblonsky,Vronsky's unhurt--but the horse . . .
officer,Her back's broken!
karenin,I'm asking you . . . if you wish to go . . .
betsy,"I'll bring her home, Alexei."
karenin," Excuse me, Princess, but Anna is not well and I want her to come with me."
karenin,You know . . . they say the Emperor dis- approves of the races . . . the danger of injury . . . but I . . .
anna,What?
karenin,"I'm saying there is a value in manly sport, for the military--"
karenin,"In my opinion, it's not the sport itself that's wrong, it's the spectacle, it's making a cruel spectacle out of--"
anna,What are you talking about?
karenin,I have to tell you--
anna,Yes.
karenin,"I have to tell you, you behaved improperly today."
anna,And how was that?
karenin,By making plain your feelings when one of the riders fell. Your conduct was improper. It must not occur again. I have said it before.
anna,"No, you were not mistaken. I love him. I am his mistress. I can't bear you, I'm afraid of you, I hate you. Do what you like to me."
karenin,"Wait, please. Move away."
anna,Are you hurt?
vronsky,What's happened?
anna,I told him I'm your mistress.
major domo,Their Excellencies Minister Karenin and Madame Karenin!
betsy,Alexei Aleksandrevich . . . congratulations. You're the only man my husband would do this for.
anna, Tell me your latest find for your library.
prince tverskoy,Not in front of the Princess.
betsy,I can tell you're happy. You've put on a little weight.
anna,Both true.
karenin,Time for bed!
anna,Alexei . . . I can't . . . I'm sorry . . . But I'm his wife now.  I am having his child.
karenin,Tell me what I did to deserve this.
levin,"How many mowers is it, Theodore?"
theodore,"Forty-two, master. In your father's time it was work for two days for thirty men . . .  . . . though he never picked up a scythe himself."
theodore,They like what they're used to.
levin,It settles me.
theodore,"How is that, master?"
levin,"When I'm mowing, I don't ask myself why I'm here."
theodore,"You're here to be master, Konstantin Dmi- trich, to be your father's son, and father to a son who will be master after you, as it has always been by the grace of God."
levin,"My father owned you, Theodore. My grand- father owned your father. Owned you like chattels, to be bought and sold. Was that by the grace of God?"
theodore,It was. Those were good times when your father had the keeping of us. That's my youngest you were looking at there. His young life is perilous now since the Free- dom came and work must be found.
theodore," At his wife too, I dare say."
levin,They look happier than I've ever been. Is it living simply that I'm looking for?
vronsky,He's some kind of prince at home. Exhaust- ing. Where is Tuskevitch this evening?
betsy,Why ask me?
makhotin,"Lucky woman. Give her my respects, and to Karenin if you see him."
betsy,Don't. Would you compromise me? And Lisa?
stremov, I only say that a man who can't govern his wife has perhaps gone as far as he can go in government.
kapitonich,"Good evening, Your Excellency."
vronsky,I am expected.
vronsky,"It's punishment enough that I'm on escort duty, without . . ."
anna,"Yes--I'm sorry--it's my demon, I can't help it."
vronsky,You wrote that you were ill.
anna,"Did I? Well, I am!  But don't worry! It won't be for long, I'll soon be out of your way--soon!"
vronsky,Stop.
anna,"No, it's true. I was told it in a dream."
anna,"Yes, and I'm only going to die having your baby."
vronsky,That's all nonsense!
anna,"Tell me it is, tell me it is. You love me. Only me."
vronsky,Your note said your husband would be out.
anna,"He was late. Serves him right. And you. Why do you call him my husband? He isn't my husband--he's a clock, a wooden doll--"
vronsky,But it was awkward . . . a matter of your honour. You made an agreement.
anna,Do you think of my honour when you're sharing whores with your Hindoo!
vronsky,Your demon again!
vronsky,Anna . . .
anna,Put your hand there. There! Did you feel him move!
stremov,"I must respectfully ask Minister Karenin whether his proposals for the regulation of these colourful Gypsy tribes, of these schol- arly God-fearing Jews, and of--but I'm afraid I have lost the Minister's attention . . ."
kapitonich,"Only Madame, Your Excellency."
anna,I wanted to see him because . . .
karenin,I do not wish to be told why a woman wants to see her lover.
anna,What are you . . . ?
karenin,I want his letters.
anna, Alexei . . . please . . . leave me Serozha . . . !
karenin,"Do you think I would let you have my son? You are depraved, a woman without honour. I thank God the curse of love is lifted from me."
oblonsky,Levin! What . . . ?
levin,I need your advice . . .
countess nordston,"Well, is he coming?"
levin,Am I late? Who is here?
oblonsky,Of course you're late! Come and meet . . . Countess Nordston.
prince shcherbatsky,Come into the fold . . .
dolly,Kitty is here.
kitty,Konsantin . . . what a long time since we saw each other.
levin,"Since you saw me, but I saw you not so long ago."
kitty,When?
levin,You were driving to Ergoshovo . . . I was at Kashin for the haymaking.
kitty,"Oh, but why didn't you . . . ?"
kitty,I hope not--I was young and silly in those days.
levin,Months and months ago!
kitty,And you haven't changed.
levin,No. I haven't.
oblonsky,"Permit me to announce--soup Marie Lou- ise, carp with asparagus, and roast beef! I went to the market in person!"
karenin,"I've been on tour in the regions, a govern- ment commission . . . I'm sorry--I have come to tell you our connection must be severed. I'm going to divorce your sister."
oblonsky,"Divorce? Dear me, what are you talking about? Don't be in a hurry. Stay to dinner and later talk it over with Dolly--"
karenin,"Prince Oblonsky, everything is over between our families."
oblonsky, Alexei . . . divorce is one thing but dinner is quite another.
princess shcherbatsky,"You Petersburgers think yourselves so de bon ton compared with dull, old-fashioned"
oblonsky,"Well, what's this government commission, Karenin . . . ?"
karenin,What was the challenge about?
princess shcherbatsky,"Pryachnikov's wife, naturally."
prince shcherbatsky,"It was a matter of honour, defending a woman's honour . . ."
karenin,It sounds like barbarism to me . . . And what if the lover had killed the husband?-- would that have preserved the wife's honour too?
countess nordston,"Still, not many of us can say that our lover died for love!"
countess nordston,"Would you die for love, Konstantin Dmitrich?"
levin,I would. But not for my neighbour's wife.
countess nordston,"Ah, an idealist!"
karenin,I tried to save her. She chose ruin.
dolly,Alexei Aleksandrevich--look at me. You will have no peace of mind until you forgive her. It was Anna who taught me that.
karenin,I do not wish to forgive. I am not a cruel man. I have never hated anyone. But I hate her with all my soul for all the wrong she has done me.
oblonsky,"It's your turn to play us something, Countess."
levin,"Since we last met, there is something I have often wanted to ask you."
kitty,What is that?
kitty,Do Not . . .
levin,I know what it says.
karenin,"Die, then."
karenin,How is your mistress?
kapitonich,"Safely delivered of a daughter, Your Excellency."
karenin,So . . . she is well?
kapitonich,The mistress is very poorly. The doctor . . .
vronsky,She's dying. Please let me stay.
doctor,Thank God! She talks only of you.
anna,Why doesn't he come? He is kind. He will forgive me.
midwife,He's here--look--look--can't you see him?
anna,"I want Alexei! Why doesn't he come? Give me some water. No, I mustn't, it's not good for my little girl. Or let her have a nurse. Yes--don't bring her here, because Alexei is coming and it will hurt him to see her."
doctor, More ice.
anna,"Oh, what nonsense. I must be asleep, that's what it is. You think he won't forgive me but you don't know him. No one knows him except me. I'm not afraid of him now."
anna,Take your hands away from your face. Look at my husband. He's a saint! Take his hand. Alexei--take his hands away.
vronsky,"Whatever you think of me, please believe me, I love her--I could not have done other- wise than what I . . . what I did."
karenin,But you must leave now. I promise to send for you if she asks for you. I don't know what happened. I forgive you. I forgive Anna. My soul is filled with joy. I will remain with her and look after her for ever.
countess vronsky,Look at you. You look like what you are. A laughingstock. I fancy you are to be asked to leave the regiment.
vronsky,"I would like you to go, Maman."
countess vronsky,"I will go when I'm ready to go. A little affair with a married woman puts a finish- ing touch to a young man's education--but this morbid, selfish obsession . . . ! You have publicly humiliated a man who has devoted his life to Russia, and it will not be forgot- ten. You'd better come back to Moscow with me. You're finished here."
vronsky,In Petersburg?  I'm finished here.
levin,". . . no, I'll go to her and tell her it's not too late to stop this business! Better now than when we're married and she realises she doesn't love me!"
oblonsky,But she does love you!
levin,"How can she? I mean, look at me! Suppose she's only marrying me to get married? Suppose she's still in love with Vronsky?"
matvey,"Your coat, sir."
princess shcherbatsky,Konstantin!--what-- ?
levin,I have to talk to Kitty.
princess shcherbatsky,You're not allowed to see her!
kitty,No. I don't understand at all! What's the matter with you?
levin,You can't love me. Think it over! Let people say what they like!
levin,Yes. If you don't love me.
kitty,But I do love you!
levin,"Do you? Well, I love you!"
kitty,"Oh, Konstantin!"
betsy,". . . and there was her husband wearing her best ballgown, rouge all over his face . . . ma chere, le scandale! . . . But I'd better tell you some regimental news . . ."
karenin,Who is here?
footman,"Princess Elisabeth Federovna Tverskaya, Your Excellency."
karenin,Please excuse me.
anna,No--stay.
karenin,You look feverish.
betsy,We have been talking too much--so I'm going.
anna,Princess Betsy came to tell me . . .
betsy,"Goodbye, my treasure."
karenin,"I agree with you. As he is going away, there is no need for Count Vronsky to come here."
karenin,But it is for you to decide.
anna,"Yes, and I decided."
karenin,Then I am very glad that--
anna,"That we agree, so perhaps we can stop talk- ing about it."
karenin,Of course. Is there anything I can do for you?
anna,"Yes, can you please please please stop crack- ing your knuckles.  I'm a bad woman. But I can't breathe. Your kindness which I can't repay, and your FORGIVENESS--"
karenin,You begged me for my forgiveness.
anna,But I didn't die and now I have to live with it! If only you would have gone on hating me.
anna, Not to say goodbye.
karenin,I can't hear.
anna,Not to say goodbye.
karenin," You would be lost. Irretrievably lost. You would have no position. And worse if we divorce. You would be the guilty party. That means you cannot legally remarry. Your union with Count Vronsky would be illegitimate, and so would your daughter who now has the protection of my name. And that is what you want! It would be a sin to help you destroy yourself."
anna,You forget something. Count Vronsky and I love each other.
karenin,And this love sanctifies a criminal folly?
karenin, I see. And Serozha . . . ?
anna,"I would die for him, but I won't live like this for him. When he knows about love, he'll forgive me."
karenin,"Then I must choose the smaller sin. Vronsky robbed me of my cloak and I will give him my coat. I will give you grounds to divorce me, and I'll accept the scandal, the humilia- tion and the consequences to my career."
anna,No . . . I can't . . .
karenin,You may write to him but I would prefer you not to see him until you have left this house.
vronsky,You look like a boy. But so pale. We'll go south . . . to the sea air and sunshine . . .
slyudin,". . . and Madame Odette in person, so to speak, Your Excellency, with your permission . . ."
karenin,Madame Odette . . . ?
shopkeeper,"Excuse the liberty, Your Excellency . . . it's for a bonnet and some ribbons Her Excel- lency has overlooked. If you wish us to address ourselves to Her Excellency, please be so good as to tell us where we might . . ."
lydia,I have forced my way in! I have heard!
karenin,"Countess, every shopkeeper has heard."
lydia,My dear friend! Don't give way to sorrow. Our Lord Jesus Christ has you in his care.
karenin,"No, I'm done for. I don't understand any- thing. All day long I'm being asked to make decisions about bills and servants, the kitchen, Serozha's clothes . . ."
lydia,I understand. I understand everything. I am going to act. The household arrangements you can leave to me. I will come every day. I will be a second mother to Serozha.
levin,"This is Agafia, and Vasili, the steward . . . My wife, Ekaterina Alexandrovna Levin."
kitty,I am very pleased to meet you both.
levin,And that was Kuzma. Come inside!
levin,Is it all right?
kitty,No--I want to see everything.
levin,A moment.
levin,"It's me, Konstantin."
nikolai,"Yes, good. The doctor here is useless--get me a doctor from Moscow."
levin,"Where did you go? I asked for you every- where, when I was getting married."
masha, I'm sorry . . . I couldn't leave him. I know I've done wrong.
agafia,I couldn't go against Nikolai Dmitrich's orders . . .
levin,Yes--yes . . . She's going.
levin,I will nurse him with Agafia . . . The woman will find somewhere in the village. You won't see her. She knows it's impossible for you to meet her. It is a torment to me that I have brought you under the same roof
kitty,"Good. A clean nightshirt and sheets. A towel and a clean pail of warm water. Ask Agafia for vinegar, and to prepare a bed somewhere for Masha. Wait."
kitty,I'm not looking.
nikolai, I'm going . . .
levin,"Thank you, Father . . . and how much . . . ?"
kitty,"You're such an expert on love, Kostya . . . why didn't you know it when you saw it?"
lydia,"Alexei, they're back! Here in St. Petersburg! She has written to me."
karenin,To you? . . . I think I don't have the right to refuse . . . It's the boy's birthday . . .
lydia,My friend . . . you would be blowing on the embers of a fire which must be allowed to die . . . Let me write to her.
anna,I'm here to see Sergei Alexeyich.
anna,I have brought something for Sergei Alexeyich.
kapitonich,He is not up yet. Would you wish to wait? Who shall I say . . . ?
kapitonich,Please allow me!
anna,I've come to see Sergei Alexeyich.
kapitonich,He's been moved to the small sitting room.
kapitonich,I'll just look in.
serozha,Mama.
anna,"Oh, my dear little boy."
serozha,I knew you would come. Today is my birthday.
anna,"I won't cry. It's time for you to get dressed. And I almost forgot your present, look . . . open it . . ."
serozha,You don't want that . . . Let me see.
korney,It's your fault for letting her in!--you should be sacked.
kapitonich,"Oh yes, you would have sent her packing! Ten years I've been keeping the door and the mistress was always kind to me. You should stick to stealing the master's clothes."
lukich,I've had enough of this--it's my job to get the boy out of bed before His Excellency comes . . .
serozha,Don't go!--he's not coming yet.
anna,"Yes, I must, and you must love Papa-- he's better than I am. When you're grown-up . . ."
serozha,No one in the whole world is better than you.
anna,Where's Anya?
annushka,She's still asleep. Should I take your coat?
anna,I'm not sleeping.
annushka,I can send out for something.
vronsky,Why are you in the dark?
anna,To where? To whom?
vronsky,What's the matter?
anna,I didn't know what happened to you.
vronsky,But I told you yesterday . . . My brother . . .
anna,Does it take all day for you to meet your brother? Does he need you more than I do?
vronsky,What's happened?
yashvin,It's wonderful to have you both returned.
anna,How good you are to come. You're the very first person to call on me since our return.
yashvin,But perhaps you'll meet at the opera tonight?
anna,I would love to be there if I could get a box.
yashvin," Madame, your box is number four! You'll find me there with Princess Myagkaya. Will you come, Vronsky?"
anna,I see why . . . Alexei is so fond of you.
vronsky,You know you can't go to the theatre?
anna,Annushka!
vronsky,For heaven's sake--
anna,A bath. I'll come in and choose a dress.
vronsky,Anna--I implore you--don't you know . . . ?
anna,I'm not ashamed of who I am or what I've done: are you ashamed for me? Why do you keep a room at the hotel? Aren't we together? Have you changed towards me?
vronsky,It's because I love you and care about you.
vronsky,That would make it worse.
anna,"You're afraid. Well, I'm not."
princess myagkaya,Anna . . . !
princess myagkaya,Should we visit or stay put?
anna,Stay put.
vronsky,You'll come up to see us afterwards . . . ?
alexander,Talk to Varya.
vronsky,Will you call on Anna?
varya,"Oh, Alexei . . . I'm fond of you . . . but . . ."
vronsky,"For God's sake, Anna isn't a criminal!"
varya,I'd call on her if she'd only broken the law. But she broke the rules.
princess myagkaya,"Who has made the decor? Haven't we got a programme? Colonel, would you be so kind . . . ?"
yashvin,Of course.
anna,"Thank you, how very . . ."
prince tverskoy,"Catullus, printed in Venice, 1501 . . . remarkable."
house manager," A thousand apologies, Princess, but . . ."
vronsky,Captain Makhotin . . .
wife,Fetch my cloak!
wife,What are we coming to?
betsy," Yes, why don't you? Rescue her and put your seal on the fiasco."
vronsky,"As far as I'm concerned, she's my wife."
betsy,"But, as you saw, she isn't."
vronsky,"We're going to Moscow, and then to my place in the country."
betsy,That sounds like a good idea.
vronsky,"But for a day or two, Anna will be at home, at my flat."
anna,. . . you had an excellent night! Does your mother want you to marry the widow or the child?
vronsky,Either one.
anna,"Don't make a joke of it. If you loved me, you would have locked me in to stop me going."
anna,Go to bed.
anna,I won't sleep.
vronsky,I know how to make you sleep.
anna,I understand.
dolly,"No, no--you don't. Kitty and her husband are with us. She's in Moscow to have the baby."
anna,"Kitty . . . ? Oh, tell her how pleased I am . . . !"
dolly,Perhaps I'll wait a year or two.  Oh . . . love!
anna,Yes . . . love! Don't you disapprove of me for what I've done?
dolly,"No. I wish I'd done the same. But no one asked me! Well . . . I wouldn't have been brave enough.  Stiva, you know . . . he doesn't change . . . like all men, I suppose."
annushka,Madame . . . Madame . . .
anna,What time is it? Is Anya up?
anna,I'm all right. It's all right.  Get them to bring up all our trunks and travel cases. We've been here long enough.
anna,"I had an inspiration. Why do we have to wait here? Why can't we wait in the coun- try? I don't want to hear any more about a divorce, or think about it."
vronsky,Good! I'm bored here. When should we go?
anna,"If I bore you here, I'll bore you in the country."
vronsky,I didn't say you bore me. Moscow bores me. When should we go? . . . Tomorrow?
vronsky,"The day after, then."
anna,If you like.
vronsky,"No, wait. That's Sunday. I have to see Maman."
anna,That's twenty minutes away in the train-- you could go to see her tomorrow--or was it that you wanted to spend Sunday with Princess Sorokina?
vronsky,"Please don't spoil everything. I can't see Maman tomorrow because she won't have read the papers she has to sign. Oh, and then there's the bank . . . But we can leave on Tuesday."
anna,"In that case, let's not bother. I'll leave on Sunday or not at all."
vronsky,That's absurd!
vronsky,Anna . . . Anna . . .
anna,"You've stopped loving me. You've given up everything for me, and it's turned you against me. Why lie about it?"
vronsky,"Stop. I put off our departure for a day or two, and you tell me I don't love you."
anna,"Because I've been living off your love and there's none left, so this is over! Finished."
anna,I'm sorry. I don't mind when we go.
vronsky,I'll telegraph Maman. We'll go on Sunday. I'll do anything you want.
vronsky,I don't want to. I love you.
anna,Why?
vronsky,You can't ask why about love.
vronsky,So--will you be all packed? I'll be out today making the arrangements.
anna,Is that your way of telling me you'll be at your mother's with that simpering little princess?
anna,"Well, I know what that means."
vronsky,"My God, this is unendurable."
anna,"Thank you, but if I'm not fit to dine in soci- ety, I won't eat with the band. Who was the telegram from?"
vronsky,"I didn't show it to you, because Stiva keeps telegraphing what we already know. Kare- nin promises nothing, but will consider . . ."
anna,"I told you I don't care about the divorce, so why hide the telegram? What else do you hide from me?"
anna,Why do you care about the divorce? What has it got to do with us loving each other?
vronsky,"Until we're married, our daughter is legally Karenin's. I care about it because we need to be free to marry."
anna,You're perfectly free to marry anyone your mother wants.
vronsky,But we aren't talking about--
anna,"Yes, we are, and, by the way, compared to your mother I'm the Virgin Mary."
vronsky,Is there anything you wish to say to me?
anna,So it's the child.
vronsky,She brought papers from Maman.
anna,Unpack everything. We're not going.
annushka,Anna Arkadyeva . . .
anna,"When Count Vronsky comes back, tell him . . . I don't want to be disturbed."
anna,Count Vronsky . . . ?
annushka,"He went out early, to the stables, he said."
anna,"Oh, Annushka . . . I should have died. Do you remember?"
annushka,"Don't take it to heart, Anna Arkadyeva . . ."
anna,I've made him hate me.
michael,"Count Vronsky had already left, Your Excel- lency. He took a cab to the station . . . to the Countess."
anna,Are you waiting for the Princess Sorokina?
maidservant,Look at that lace on her . . .
levin,I'll be buying in feed before winter's over.
theodore," Well, you don't press people hard, but you live rightly, for your soul, not your belly."
levin,My soul! What's that? I know what my belly is. How do we know what's rightly? I believe in reason.
levin, No.
theodore,"You're a great one for reasoning, Konstantin Dmitrich, but what's rightly is outside your mathematic--that's what's rightly about it!"
levin,Where's Ekaterina Alexandrovna?
agafia,"It's all right, the mistress is giving Mitya his bath."
kitty,And what was that?
levin,He smiled at me.
kitty, He's very advanced for his age.
