Speaker,Dialogue
voice over,INTERCOM Dick Laurent is dead.
renee,You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
fred,What are you going to do?
renee,I thought I'd stay home and read.
fred,"Read?... Read what, Renee?"
fred,It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
renee,"I like to laugh, Fred."
fred,That's why I married you.
renee,Wake me up when you get home.
fred,What's that?
renee,A videotape.
fred,Who's it from?
renee,"I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it."
fred,Does it say anything on the tape?
renee," No, nothing."
fred,"Well, let's see what's on it."
renee,It must be from a real estate agent.
fred,Maybe.
fred,"Good book, huh?"
renee," Huh?... oh, yeah, it is."
fred,Same one you were reading the other night?
renee,What night?
fred,When you didn't come to the club.
renee,"Oh. Oh, yeah.  No. This is a different one."
fred,"I called, you know."
renee,Called?  When?
fred,From the club.  You didn't answer.
renee,"I must have fallen asleep.  I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?"
fred,"You were asleep when I got home, yes."
renee, I told you you could wake me up if you wanted to.
fred,I had a dream about you last night...
renee,Yeah?
fred,You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
renee," Fred?  Fred, where are you?"
renee,"Fred, are you all right?"
fred,You're up early.
renee,"That dog woke me.  I lay there for a while, then decided to get up."
fred,Who the hell owns that dog?
fred,What's that?  Another tape?
renee,"Yes, I just found it on the step."
fred,Don't you want to watch it?
renee,I guess so.
fred,"Well, do you wanna watch it?"
renee,Yeah.
renee,We've got to call the police.
fred,All right.
renee,"...yes, I've been on hold for ten minutes... I can't... All right, thanks."
renee,"Hello, yes... Good... My name is Renee Madison... My husband is Fred Madison, the jazz musician... we    live at 442 Hollis Street... Right... 442 Hollis... near the observatory... Someone's been in the house... at night... while we were sleeping... I know because they sent, dropped off a videotape... two videotapes... to show us... That's right... Yes... it... the second one... shows us asleep... Someone broke in and taped us while we slept!... Isn't that enough?... Okay, sure... We will... 442 Hollis... Yes, we'll be here."
renee,Two detectives are coming out.
fred,That's it.
ed,Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
al,Very strange.
renee,What is?
al,The angle.  The high angle shot on the tape.
ed,How'd the camera get so high like that?
al,"And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean."
ed,Like you'd get if it was hand held.
al,Right ... This just glided along.
ed,This is the bedroom.
al,Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
fred,This is our bedroom.
ed,There's no other bedroom?
fred,"No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed."
al,You're a musician?
fred,"Yes, I thought my wife ..."
ed,What's your axe?
fred,Tenor... Tenor saxophone.  Do you...
ed, Tone deaf.
al, Do you own a video camera?
renee,No. Fred hates them.
fred,I like to remember things my own way.
al,What do you mean by that?
fred,How I remember them.  Not necessarily the way they happened.
ed,Do you have an alarm system?
renee,"Yes, actually we do... but we haven't been using it."
al,Why not?
fred,It kept going off for some reason.  False alarms.
ed,Might be a good time to try using it again.
al,Anybody else have a key to the house.
renee,No.
al,Maid?  Relative?
renee,"No, one of us is always here to let the maid in.  Nobody else has a key."
ed, Let's check the doors and windows... See if there's been a break-in.
ed,As best we can.
al,"If anything else happens, you'll call us. Al hands Fred a card.  Ed hands Renee a card."
renee,We will.
fred,"Thanks, guys."
ed,It's what we do.
renee,What the hell is going on?!
fred, I wish I knew.
renee,What was that?!!!
fred,What?
renee,On the tape!  There was something else on the tape.
al,You don't remember being awakened?  It looks like you were aware of someone.
ed,Or something.
fred,"No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember."
renee,Why would anyone do something like this?
al,Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
ed,Or not so recently?
fred,"No, not to me."
renee,I...    no. No. No threats.
ed,"We'll take the tapes with us, if that's all right with you?"
al,We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
renee,I don't know if I want to stay here.  I don't feel safe.
fred,Where would you feel safe?
renee,I don't know. maybe a hotel.
ed,Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
fred,The first night ... Not the last two.
al,Why not?
fred," I forgot.  Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid."
renee,"Acting paranoid?!!! Someone is in our house while we're sleeping, filming us, and you don't want to act paranoid?!!! I thought you set the alarm!"
fred,I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
renee,But that doesn't solve the problem.  Who is doing this?  And why?
al,"We'll find out, Mrs. Madison."
mystery man,"We've met before, haven't we?"
fred,I don't think so.  Where was it that you think we've met?
mystery man,At your house.  Don't you remember?
fred," No, no I don't.  Are you sure?"
mystery man,"Of course.  In fact, I'm there right now."
fred, What do you mean?  You're where right now?
mystery man,At your house.
fred,That's absurd.
mystery man,Call me.
mystery man, Dial your number.
mystery man, Go ahead.
fred,How did you do that?
mystery man,Ask me.
fred, How did you get into my house?
fred,Who are you?
mystery man,It's been a pleasure talking to you.
renee,I thought you were getting me a drink?
fred,Just a minute.
fred,"Andy, who is that guy?"
andy," I don't know his name.  He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think."
fred,Dick Laurent?
andy,"Yes, I believe so."
fred," But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?"
andy,He is?  I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
fred,I don't.  I don't know him.
andy, Dick can't be dead.  Who told you he was dead?
renee,"Honey, who?... Who's dead?"
fred,Let's go home.
renee,But...
fred,Now!  We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
fred,"How'd you meet that asshole, Andy, anyway?"
renee,It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
fred,What job?
renee,"I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay..."
fred,He's got some fucked up friends.
fred,Stay in the car!
fred,I told you to stay in the car!
renee,Why? what is it?  Why did you make me wait out here?
fred,I thought there might be somebody inside.
renee,Was there?
fred,No... of course not.
renee,"It's so odd... Waiting out there, I had the strangest feeling... Like this had happened before.  I mean, your telling me to stay outside while you went in like that."
renee," Fred?  Fred, where are you?"
fred,Renee!
ed,"Stay put, killer!"
fred,I didn't kill her! Tell me I didn't kill her!
attendant,"Hi, doc. Workin' late tonight, huh?"
attendant,"Howdy, Joyce."
joyce,"Howdy, George."
joyce,I don't know if I can watch this.
joyce,You talking to me or... her?
judge,Have you reached a verdict?
foreman,"Yes, we have, your honor."
judge,Please hand it to the bailiff.
judge,And what is your verdict?
foreman,We the jury find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree.
judge,"Fred Madison, the jury having found you guilty of murder in the first degree, it is my order that on a date to be determined, you be put to death in the electric chair."
raquel,Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
marian,How could I miss it?  The TV won't quit with that stuff.
raquel,They're gonna cook him.
marian,Andy's from Utah.  He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
raquel,Which would you choose?
marian,"Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely."
raquel,Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
marian,"The heart, I guess."
raquel,"I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on.  Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity.  Savage pain, Marian."
marian,"Oh, that's hot... So you'd rather be hung, huh?"
raquel,"Absolutely... Soon as your neck snaps, you black out.  It might take a while for the body to die, but you wouldn't feel it."
marian,"You might be right, Raquel."
andy,Guess who?
guard,"Make yourself to home, fella."
warden, Okay.
warden,"Any final words, Sam?"
guard,Something wrong?
fred,My... My head.
guard,"Headache, huh?  Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it."
fred,"No, no.  I want to go in."
guard,"What's botbering you, Madison?"
fred,The pain is getting worse.  I need more aspirin.
guard,I can't give you anymore.  I'll talk to the doctor.
doctor,You sleeping okay?
fred, I can't sleep.
doctor,You'll sleep now.  Take him back to his cell.
guard,What is it?
fred,Aspirin... fly head.  I gotta have more aspirin.
guard,The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
fred,But my head...
guard,Who are you?  What are you doing in this cell?
guard,"This is Johnny Mack at station 8. Yeah, look, somethin' crazy's happened.  No, I mean, Madison ain't in his cell.  No, there's somebody in there, but it ain't Madison! Right, right.  Okay... Captain Henderson's comin''?... Right."
johnny mack,F-u-u-u-ck me!
captain henderson,"Now, Mack, what's the situation?"
johnny mack,"I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself."
captain henderson,That's not Fred Madison?
johnny mack,"No, sir, it's not."
captain henderson,Who is it?
johnny mack,"I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?"
captain henderson,"Yeah, Mack?"
warden,"Repeat that, Bill."
captain henderson,"Warden, it's not him.  It .was not Fred Madison in that cell."
warden,"Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?"
captain henderson,I don't know.  The guards say they've never seen him before.
warden,Where is he now?
captain henderson,"He's in the infirmary, being examined."
warden,Did you ask him who he is?
captain henderson,"He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway."
warden,"If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?"
captain henderson,I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
warden,I want to take a look at this man myself.
warden,"What is this, Rogoff?"
warden,Who is this man?
warden,He's not Madison?
warden,A headache?
warden,"Where the hell did you come from, mister?"
warden,"Well, gentlemen, we know who the stranger is. His name is Peter Raymond Dayton. He's twenty-four years old.  His birthday is April 21st.  He was born and raised right here.  He lives with his parents, William and Claire Dayton at 814 Garland Avenue.  Pete Dayton was arrested five "
captain henderson,"Nothing, Marsh.  Vanished.  There's an APB out on him.  His photo's been faxed nationwide."
warden,How the hell does she know?
warden,How the hell... 7
captain henderson,One of the guards must have leaked it.
warden,What's the word on the street?
warden,"Good, let's keep it that way.  Keep a lid on Dayton.  Nothing gets out about him."
warden,"I have a statement to read... Fred Madison, an inmate being held on death row has, apparently... has escaped.  An all-points bulletin has been issued to authorities not only statewide, but nationwide.  We are confindent that he will be apprehended very soon.  No further details are available at this time.  Thank you very much."
reporter,"Warden, nobody's ever escaped from death row before.  How did he get out?"
warden,"I'm Warden Clements.  This is Captain Henderson and Dr. Rogoff.  Please, sit down."
bill,The wife killer?
warden,Yes.
claire,"How is this possible, Warden?"
warden,"...Tell me, what was Peter's condition the last time you saw him?"
bill,His condition?  What do you mean?
warden,His physical condition.
bill, Same as always.  Pete takes care of himself.
claire,"I saw him before he went to the garage day before yesterday.  He's a mechanic. Look, is he okay?  Can we see him?"
bill,Was he in a fight?
claire,But what is the cause then? ... And how did he get in that cell?
bill,That doesn't sound like Pete.
captain henderson,You don't know Fred Madison?
bill,No... Only what was in the news.
captain henderson,Do you think Pete knows him?
claire,I wouldn't know how.
warden, You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
claire,"When he went to work, right."
warden,What about yesterday?
claire,He didn't come home.
bill,Sometimes he stays at a friend's.
captain henderson,Any particular friends?
bill,"A girl's, a buddy's.  I don't know.  He's his own man; he comes and goes as he pleases."
claire,I want to see him.
warden,"Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here."
claire, Pete...
claire,"Pete, what happened to you?"
pete, Where ... am I?
pete,My head hurts.
warden,A man named Fred Madison was occupying that cell.  He's missing. we're trying to find out how it is you were in there and not him.
pete,I... I don't know.
captain henderson,Do you know Fred Madison?
pete, No.
claire," Warden, can we take him home?"
captain henderson,We need to find out what happened here.
bill, Have you made any charges against him?
warden,No.
bill,Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
warden,"All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave."
captain henderson, You just gonna let him go?
warden,We'll get a tail put on him.
bill,"Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay."
claire,"Are you hungry, honey?  I'll fix you something."
pete,No... I don't feel so good.  I would like some aspirin.
claire,Coming up.

voice,We just killed a couple of people...
pete,What?
voice,You heard me... We thought we'd come over and tell you about it.
pete,What's goin' on?
voice,"Great question!! In the east ... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced...
