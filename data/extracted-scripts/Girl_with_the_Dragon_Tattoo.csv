blomkvist,"What is this, the media event of the year? REPORTER 1 Don't try to play it down, Mikael, it won't work."
blomkvist,"Don't try to play it up, that won't either. 4A   EXT. COURTHOUSE - STOCKHOLM - DAY - CONTINUOUS            4A"
reporter 2,"Will you appeal? BLOMKVIST I'll appeal to you, Viggo:   Find a real story to cover. He hurries off in the rain."
tv newscaster,"In an article published earlier this year, Blomkvist claimed Wennerstrom - founder and president of The Wennerstrom Group - used State funds intended for industrial development in Poland for an arms deal with the right-wing Ustashe in Croatia.  The report cuts to a shot of Wennerstrom outside the courthouse in an Armani suit, surrounded by his legal team, confidently addressing the reporters -  WENNERSTROM ON TV I have nothing against Mr. Blomkvist. He's a good journalist who I don't believe is guided by malice. But what he wrote was inaccurate, and inaccuracies can't go unanswered. He - all journalists - have to accept like the rest of us, actions have consequences.  Done with his sandwich, Blomkvist goes to the counter. BLOMKVIST Marlboro Red ... and a lighter. 6   EXT. CAFE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                               6  He comes out tamping the pack. Extracts a cigarette. Tosses the pack in a sidewalk trash bin. Flicks at the lighter but can't get it to fire in the wind and rain. Hunches his body around it, coaxes it to life.  TV NEWSCASTER V/O Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600 thousand SKE in damages and all court costs, which could be significantly more.  He takes a long drag that dizzies him. A wonderful feeling. He regards the trash bin. Fishes around it, finds the pack, puts it in his coat pocket.  7   EXT. MILLENNIUM OFFICES, STOCKHOLM - DAY - ESTABLISHING       7 8   INT. MILLENNIUM'S OFFICES - DAY                               8  He comes through past Christmas decorations and a mostly- young staff. They try not to regard him as a dead-man- walking, but aren't entirely successful. He enters the editor's office. 4."
erika,Where you been?
blomkvist,Walking.    Thinking.
erika,Smoking?
blomkvist,"Just one. He sits, exhausted and depressed, in a cheap Poang chair. ERIKA TV4 called. I told them no statement until we've read the judgment in its entirety."
blomkvist,I have.    Who else? ERIKA Everyone who's ever wanted to see you humiliated. BLOMKVIST You've been on the phone all day then.
erika,I'm as much to blame for this as you.
blomkvist,You are?    You wrote it? ERIKA I read it.    I ran it.
blomkvist,"Not the same. ERIKA Our credibility isn't dead, Mikael."
blomkvist,Mine is. They regard each other in another silence.      Then - 5.
blomkvist,I'm tired. I feel like climbing under a duvet and sleeping for a week. ERIKA Alone? He thinks about it ... shakes his head `no.'
erika,I already called Greger and told him I wouldn't be home tonight. 9    EXT. STOCKHOLM - SAME TIME - DAY                              9
armansky,"It's possible we could wait forever. FRODE You called her, I thought.     You spoke to her. ARMANSKY I'm afraid that doesn't mean much."
frode,I don't understand.
armansky,No one here likes her. So it's better if she works at home. FRODE But you told her I wanted to meet her.
armansky,But I've told her many more times I prefer her not to meet clients.
armansky,I'm concerned you won't like her. She's different. FRODE In what way.
armansky,In every way. 13   INT. MILTON SECURITY - STOCKHOLM - SAME TIME - DAY          13
armansky,"Lisbeth, Mr. Dirch Frode. FRODE How do you do? 7."
salander,Something wrong with the report? FRODE No. It seems quite thorough. There's a wealth of data here. But I'm also interested to know what's not in it.
salander,There's nothing not in it.
frode,Your opinion of him isn't.
salander,I'm not paid to give my opinion.
frode,So you don't have one?
frode,He's - excuse me?
salander,"He's honest. He's who he presents himself to be. In his business, that's an asset."
frode,There's less in his asset column after his conviction today. SALANDER That's true. He made a fool of himself with that. If it happened that way. Frode looks at Armansky.    What's that supposed to mean?
salander,"If he made up the story, that's out of character. So is giving up without a fight. People don't do things that are out of character."
frode,Are you saying he was set up? 8.
salander,That wasn't part of my assignment.
salander,"The judgement will just about empty his savings. This seems to please Frode more than anything else that has been said, and Salander sees it. SALANDER May I go?"
frode,Your report is light in another area. His personal life. Anything you chose not to include? SALANDER Nothing that warranted inclusion.
frode,I'm not sure if that means yes or no.
armansky,"I think what Ms. Salander means, and I agree, is that everyone has a right to a certain amount of privacy, even when they're being investigated."
frode,Not in this case. I have to know if there's anything about him I might find unsavory - even if she doesn't.
frode,You were right not to include that.
salander,I know. FRODE Anything else? SALANDER No.
frode,Please think before you say no. SALANDER I did. FRODE I don't want to be surprised by something later.
frode,So. Nothing else. In the personal department. You're sure.
salander, He likes sandwiches. A15   EXT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING                A15
erika,"Usually when I wake up in a cold bed, it's at home."
blomkvist,Sorry.
erika,What are you doing? 10.
blomkvist,Writing the press release.
erika,Saying - BLOMKVIST You're taking over as publisher. You're sorry for any nuisance Wennerstrom was caused. I can't be reached for comment.
erika,You're giving up. BLOMKVIST Just taking a few steps aside. For you. ERIKA This makes me sick. 16    OMIT:   INT. BOOKSTORE - STOCKHOLM - DAY                  16
annika,He declined. BLOMKVIST As she hoped. ANNIKA Never a good idea mixing family and business.
blomkvist,And I still would have lost.
gregor,Did you have ... anything on him.
blomkvist,I had a lot.    It just wasn't any good.
erika,It wasn't even about Mikael. It was Wennerstrom sending a message to the press as a whole - and the FSA: Don't ask questions.
pernilla,Mom's worried. BLOMKVIST About me?
pernilla,About all that money. 12.
doctor,You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter? SALANDER His ward.   He doesn't have a daughter.
blomkvist,Nilla?    What are you doing? PERNILLA Nothing.
blomkvist, You're not serious. 13. 13. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
pernilla,I don't want to talk about it since I know you won't approve.
blomkvist,Of -  Nilla. PERNILLA Light of Life.
blomkvist,Light of - what?  What is that?
pernilla,You think it's all senseless but it isn't. It's more natural to believe in something than not to.
blomkvist,Hello. FRODE O/S Mr. Blomkvist?
blomkvist,Yes.
blomkvist,Of course. FRODE O/S He'd like to speak to you about a private matter. 14.
blomkvist,"You know, you're calling at an awkward time."
blomkvist,Have him call me. FRODE O/S He'd like to meet in person if that's okay. Up north. Hedestad.
blomkvist,No.   Sorry.
blomkvist,"And last, I'm sure. FRODE It's lovely in the spring."
blomkvist,You said it was lovely in winter.
frode,This is unseasonable.
blomkvist,I'll be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm.
frode,"Unless we get snowed in ... I'm joking. You'll be home tonight, if that's what you wish."
vanger,Welcome.   Come inside.    It's warm. 16.
frode,Mr. Blomkvist would like to be on the 4:30 train back to Stockholm.
vanger,What?
blomkvist,I can't stay for dinner.
vanger,"Oh. I guess I'd better be quick then. Thank you, Dirch. Mikael, this way. 29   INT. VANGER'S STUDY - DAY                                   29"
vanger,What do you know about me? BLOMKVIST That you used to run one of the biggest industrial firms in the country.
vanger,Used to.   That's correct.
vanger,My grandfather forged the tracks the 4:30 train will take you home on - and most of the other pre-state-owned rail lines.   We stitched this country together. We made the steel and milled the lumber that built modern Sweden.  Fertilizer.
blomkvist,Doing.
vanger,"Officially, assisting me with my memoirs. But what you'd really be doing is solving a mystery. And you'd do that by doing what you do so well - this recent legal mishap of yours notwithstanding. You'd be investigating thieves, misers, bullies, and malcontents - the most detestable collection of people you'll ever meet ... my family. A30   EXT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING                 A30"
vanger,"Isn't it interesting how fascists always steal the word freedom.  The 4:30. Yes. Okay. Anyway, Richard died a martyr to the Nazi cause in 1940 - missed all the real excitement - but not the opportunity to regularly beat his wife Margareta and their son, Gottfried."
vanger,"Now, Gottfried - Harriet's father - was what people used to call a Good- Time-Charlie."
blomkvist,They're still called that. VANGER Are they?   Okay. INSERT:   Close on a photo of Gottfried.
vanger,"He was a charmer, a ladies man, a drunk. In other words, a born salesman - which is what he did for the company - traveling around, taking clients out to dinner and so on."
blomkvist,"Someone has to do it. VANGER That's right. Anyway, he died in 1965. Drowned. Drunk. Here on the island. A studio photo: Gottfried with his wife and two children."
vanger,His wife Isabella - who was pretty much useless before as a parent - became even more so after his death - which is when I began looking after their children - Martin - who runs Vanger Industries now that I'm retired - and Harriet. 20.
vanger,"She was bright and curious, a winning combination in any person. BLOMKVIST And beautiful. Vanger nods as he regards the photo ..."
blomkvist,Something happened to her?
vanger,What was she going to tell me? Why didn't I make time for her? Why didn't I listen?
blomkvist,She couldn't have run away?
vanger,Not without being seen.
vanger,"Firemen stayed on the bridge all night pumping out the gasoline. And no one swam across, or took a row boat. All of them were still tied up on this side Sunday. Believe me, we checked. 45B   INT. VANGER MANOR - DUSK - PRESENT DAY                   45B"
blomkvist,She couldn't have fallen and drowned?
vanger,The currents aren't strong here. Anything that falls into the water turns up nearby. Like her father. His body didn't drift more than ten meters when he drowned the year before. Vanger's pauses at a landing to steady himself and his labored breathing.
vanger,"No. Someone killed her, Mr. Blomkvist. Someone on the island that day. Someone close enough to know what she used to give me each year on my birthday. He unlocks the door of the attic and pushes it open to reveal a cluster of nine dusty framed dried flowers on a wall. 24."
vanger,These were from her.
blomkvist,Who knows about these?
vanger,"Me, the police, the murderer ... and now you."
vanger,"- studying their reports and interviews, all the information there was, and it's a lot. I've spent half my life examining the events of a single day. And for all that, he's no closer to the truth."
blomkvist,I understand your frustration. But what you're asking me to do is a waste of money. VANGER We haven't discussed your fee. BLOMKVIST We don't need to. I can't find something you haven't been able to in forty years.
vanger,You don't know that. You have a very keen investigative mind.
blomkvist,You want me to set aside my life and career for something that's a complete waste of time.
vanger,"Think of it as a well deserved vacation. A way of avoiding all the people you want to avoid right now.  As for compensation, I'll pay you twice your salary for as many months as it takes. I'll quadruple it if you solve the mystery. 26."
blomkvist,Mr.  -
vanger,I'm not done. I'll throw in one more thing - even though you're a terrible negotiator. It's what you want more than anything else and it can't be bought at any price. I'll give it to you ... Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.
plague,Would you like to sit? I could possibly clear a place if necessary.
plague,I'm on welfare; I don't administer it. This isn't enough. 27.
salander,"I had to pay three months back rent and eat a little bit. It's all I have right now. PLAGUE I find that so poignant. So much so that he does nothing more than look at her. She reaches to take the money back, but he pockets it and moves across the dark room to a work table where high-end computers fight for space with debris. Finds and gives her a small homemade electronic box, which she turns over in her hands."
plague,No `thank you?' 51    INT. MILLENNIUM OFFICE - EARLY MORNING                    51
erika,"We're in our worst crisis ever and you're writing a memoir? BLOMKVIST You fired me; I need something to do. ERIKA You fired you; I need you here, not the North Pole. You know what this is going to look like."
blomkvist,"Like I've been gutted. Like I'm running away. I am. They cross through the building, he with his cases, she with her coffee cup. 28."
blomkvist,"Wennerstrom wants to see me waving a white flag, not a red one. And the more it looks like there's a problem between you and me, the more it'll satisfy him."
erika,"There is a problem between us. He won't be satisfied until he shuts us down, and you're leaving me to fight him alone."
hussein,This is the North Pole.
blomkvist,"It's me. I'm here. It's fucking cold and I'm on a pay phone. If you tried to call, the reception sucks, and if you tried to email, there's none of that either, so - so - I'm here - and - I can't even speak it's so fucking cold."
nilsson,I'm Gunner.   The caretaker. 65   INT. COTTAGE - LATER - DAWN                               65
nilsson,"You're an author. BLOMKVIST I'm writing a biography of Mr. Vanger, yes."
nilsson,"Bit of trouble, I guess."
nilsson,"No jail time, though. That's good. Cost you a lot of money though, yeah? 31."
nilsson,There. 66   EXT. VANGER ESTATE - DAY                                  66
vanger,"The island is owned by my family. Your closest neighbor is my brother Harald, another Nazi if you can believe. Two in the family. He's detestable to put it nicely, but you'll probably never see him. He's a recluse."
blomkvist,He was there that day?
vanger,Indeed he was.
blomkvist,Does anyone speak to anyone on this island?
vanger,"Actually, Isabella - Harriet's mother - who lives there -  Cecilia's brother Birger lives there. BLOMKVIST Who doesn't he speak to? VANGER You, probably. Not that you'd want him to. He can be as unpleasant as Harald. 32."
blomkvist,I'm quickly losing track who's who.
vanger,"Oh, how you'll wish were it always so. Soon you'll know us all only too well - with my apologies.  Out there is my nephew Martin's house; Harriet's brother."
blomkvist,"Who speaks to him? VANGER I speak to him. He runs the company now, as I think I told you."
vanger,Someone shooting their dinner. Gunner probably. The caretaker. BLOMKVIST I just met him. VANGER He was 19 when Harriet disappeared.
vanger,Sorry? BLOMKVIST Your house.
vanger,"Yes, you're right. The man who hires the detective should always be kept on the suspects list. 66A   OMIT - INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                      66A"
salander,I got a call from social welfare. I've been assigned a new guardian.
morell,I'd like to see the girl's room.
vanger,It's down the hall. 34.
morell,I thought this was your house.
vanger,It is.    She lives with me. MORELL Are her parents alive? VANGER Her mother is.
younger vanger,What about the search?
morell,First thing in the morning. YOUNGER VANGER No. We should do it now. She could be hurt out there.
morell,"But   I also couldn't find a motive. Was   it spontaneous? Was it planned? Did   she know something someone wished she   didn't? Was it about business? BLOMKVIST Business?   She was sixteen. MORELL And very bright. Henrik told me he could easily imagine her running the business someday, which would mean someone else wouldn't."
blomkvist,She was with some friends that day. At a parade. You must have talked to them.
morell,"She told them she wasn't feeling well. She left early. But they also said she kept secrets from them, too. The main thing I learned talking to them for hours is that teenage girls are complicated. BLOMKVIST I have one."
morell,So you know.  Did you bring the last gift Henrik received?
blomkvist,It's at the National Forensic Lab.
morell,I can tell you what their report will say now: It's a flower common to Europe. All of them are. No prints. No DNA. He lights the pipe.   Blomkvist watches the tobacco glow.
blomkvist,I wanted to ask you about this.
morell,She received this from Henrik the Christmas before. I studied it more times than I can say. I know every page of it. BLOMKVIST It's the last page I'm curious about. MORELL As was I.
blomkvist,"The only names not alphabetized. Morell nods that he knows that only too well as he turns to that last page. On it, in neat handwriting: Magda 32016 Sara 32109 R.J. 30114 R.L. 32027 Mari 32018"
morell,"They're local Hedestad phone numbers. The first belonged to a woman named Margot, whose mother was Magda, who claimed she didn't know Harriet. The fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosemarie Larsson, an elderly woman who died a few years before. The other three were unconnected in any way that I could find. He hands the address book back. It, and everything else about the case, clearly trouble him still."
blomkvist,I've reminded you of things you'd rather forget. I'm sorry.
morell,I can't forget it. It's my Rebecka Case.
morell,"Every policeman has at least one unsolved case. Back then it was old Torstensson. Year after year he kept returning to one - taking out the files - uselessly studying them. As young men, we had to laugh. BLOMKVIST Was this also a missing girl case? 38."
morell,"No, that's not why I mention it. The Rebecka Case is something that happened before Harriet was born. I'm talking about the soul of a policeman. Poor Torstensson could never solve it, and could never let it go. And neither can poor Morell with his Harriet case. 78   EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAY                                      78"
bjurman,How's Mr. Palmgren doing? I was told he had a stroke of some kind.  Terrible.
salander,Make coffee and sort mail.
bjurman,But not full-time. Not even part- time consistently. They somehow got along without coffee or mail in July and August?
salander,Enough.
bjurman,How much is your rent? 39. 39. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
salander,I pay my rent.
bjurman,When's the last time you were late? SALANDER Never. BJURMAN Do you think that ring in your eyelid makes you attractive?
salander,It isn't a discrepancy or a problem. It was clear to him I could manage my own finances. BJURMAN But that's not clear to me. SALANDER I'm not a child.
bjurman,No.  You're not.  40.
salander,I've been on my own since I was twelve. BJURMAN No. You've been a persistent burden to the State since you were twelve.
bjurman,"This behavior you're displaying right now is elaborately documented here -  - so it would come as a shock to no one if I chose an alternative to the lenient arrangement I just outlined.

liv,I found him at death's door halfway up the hill.
blomkvist,I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape.
martin,"No, it's a climb for anyone. I should've warned you. Come on in."
liv,"I live in Hong Kong now, but come back to Stockholm for family events, and when I do, I drive up to spend a couple days with Martin. MARTIN She comes for the moose steak."
blomkvist,Is that what this is?
blomkvist,That one's good.
blomkvist,That was a dark day.
liv,Sorry to remind you of it. BLOMKVIST It's okay. There are worse things than libel - though I can't immediately think of one in my business.
liv,"You're writing a book now, Martin said. BLOMKVIST Henrik's biography. LIV I love Henrik. He's fascinating. Martin, too. Together they're the Old Sweden and the New."
blomkvist,"They are. LIV You know about Harriet, right?"
blomkvist,I do.
martin,What can't.
liv,Harriet.
blomkvist,Maybe we could talk about that later.
martin,We can talk about it now.  Liv knows everything about my crazy family. Which is why she'll never marry me.
liv,That's one reason.
blomkvist,How so.
martin,"We're not Nordea or Ericsson, but we're still the largest family-owned company in the country. At the height, we had 40,000 employees. We have about half that now, and that downward slide - anyone can tell you - began after my sister's death. It broke Henrik's entrepreneurial spirit, and his heart."
blomkvist,You were here that day?
martin,"Everyone was here, though I didn't get in until after the accident on the bridge. The 4:30 train."
blomkvist,I know it well. 44.
martin,It was a terrible day. And the days after - searching and not finding her - were even worse. Liv sets her hand atop her boyfriend's.
martin,"This event, Mikael, has to be a big part of your book."
cecilia,We're all uncomfortable with the idea of a chronicle of our family. 45.
blomkvist,It's not about the family. It's about Henrik and the company.
cecilia,Like I said.
blomkvist,It's not my intention to present a malicious portrait of anyone.
cecilia,"Unlike the one that landed you in court. BLOMKVIST Unlike that one. Correct. CECILIA So, what you're saying is, you're not really here to look into what happened to Harriet."
blomkvist,"I can't ignore such a dramatic event, but no, that's not by any means my focus. CECILIA So all those boxes Gunner carted down here - which are where? - in the closet now? - weren't Henrik's private investigation.  I wonder sometimes who's crazier - my Nazi father or my obsessed uncle. INSERT of the photo of Young Harald in his Nazi uniform on the wall."
blomkvist,"Since we're talking about it, since you brought it up, what was Harriet like?"
cecilia,"I'm sure Henrik has told you. BLOMKVIST He was my age then, and so couldn't know what was really going on with a teenager any more than I can with my own daughter. You were her age. 46."
cecilia,"Actually, my sister Anita was closer to her in age."
cecilia,She knew Harriet better than anyone - certainly better than I did. You should talk to her.
blomkvist,"I'd love to, where is she. CECILIA If I had to guess - London. BLOMKVIST You don't know where your own sister lives?"
cecilia,I haven't seen her in years.       We never really got along. BLOMKVIST I'm getting used to that comment.
cecilia,That's the way it is when you're always after the same boys.
blomkvist,People generally get over that sort of thing at a certain point.
cecilia,"Oh, I'm long over it, and won't ever have to worry about it again. She hates this place even more than I do. She left, moved to London and that was it. You couldn't pay her to send a Christmas card, much less visit. BLOMKVIST I'll try to track her down for you."
cecilia,Don't bother. BLOMKVIST For myself then.
cecilia,"If you do, and try talking to her about us, don't be surprised if she tells you to fuck off. 86   INT. MACJESUS - DAY                                         86"

salander,"Hard drives at home, yeah."
tech,That's good.    This one's dead.
salander,It'll take five minutes.      It's important.
bjurman,Have you ever had an STD?  How many were men? That last one seems to amuse him; none amuse her. BJURMAN I'm required to ask you these things. It's a matter of health.
salander,Write down anything you want. Bjurman sighs. Sets the form aside and looks at the McJesus invoice again. BJURMAN Why do you need such an expensive computer?
salander,For work.
bjurman,Making coffee and sorting mail.
salander,I shouldn't even have to ask. I should have control of my money like before.
bjurman,And you will. Once you show me you can be sociable and get along with people. Can you do that?  Shall we start now?
bjurman,I know you're not thinking about telling anyone about our date. Enjoy your computer games. She takes the check and leaves.
anita,It's fine.    Please.     Have a seat.
blomkvist,I'm Mikael.
anita,Mikael.   How do you do.
anita,"You're looking for investment counseling, Mikael? BLOMKVIST I would if had any money to invest."
anita,Excuse me?

anita,"I haven't seen him in over 30 years. Or my sister. Or anyone else in my family. BLOMKVIST Most of what I'm writing about predates that, so your recollections are valid."
anita,"I wouldn't know where to start, if that was a question."
blomkvist,I can narrow it. I've gotten up to the 1960s. To the event that altered everything in Henrik's life. ANITA Harriet.  Everything I knew about that I told to - whatever his name was - that policeman - when it happened. BLOMKVIST Morell.
anita,My recollections then were a lot better than they are now.
blomkvist,"I'm not speaking of the crime itself. I'm trying to get a clearer sense of what Harriet was like. Particularly, toward the end."
anita,She was messed up. Like all us Vanger kids. Crazy mother. Drunken father. At least hers wasn't a Nazi like mine.
blomkvist,Was he abusive?
anita,Mine? BLOMKVIST Hers. 52.
anita,"I never saw it myself, but you could tell something was going on. One day she'd be withdrawn. The next she'd be putting on makeup and wearing the tightest sweater she had to school. The next she'd be studying a Bible like a nun - no Vanger was ever religious - can you imagine? Obviously, she was very unhappy."
blomkvist,"She never confided in you what about, specifically? ANITA There was no specifically. It was everything. It was being part of that family. Henrik's the only decent person in it."
blomkvist,What do you think happened to her?
anita,"Everyone knows what. BLOMKVIST But you have no ... thoughts about why, or who. ANITA All I know is I always felt sorry for her. Even more than for myself. I got out of there when I was 18 and never went back. She would have done the same but didn't make it to 18. 96   EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAY                                     96"
salander,It's me.
bjurman,Like it?
salander,It's nice.
bjurman,"It's home.  So, what do you need money for this time? Grand Theft Auto 5?"
salander,Food. He smiles.    Steps toward her.    Lifts her chin. BJURMAN How are you? Been thinking about last time? Decided you wanted to see me again? 54.
salander,I just want my money.
bjurman,"Well, let's see if I can help you out with that."
salander,Wait.
salander,"I just want to know, am I going to have to do this every time I need money to eat? BJURMAN It's so cute when you do that surly thing. Take my hand She reaches out to it and before she can react, there's a handcuff around the wrist. He quickly cuffs the other to his own wrist. This is bad. She tries to get out. He gets her in a strangle hold and chokes her into unconsciousness. 100A   INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT                 100A"
bjurman,What we're going to do now is teach you the value of money.
bjurman,I forget - did I ask you before if you liked anal sex?
bjurman,Are you sure?
bjurman,"So, next Saturday, here? 56."
erika,Is it any warmer inside? BLOMKVIST No.
blomkvist,Seriously?
erika,Is that hard to believe? Sitting up here in Lappland with your cat? 57.
blomkvist,I'm not.   I'm working.
erika,"I can see. What she can see is the Vanger research covering the walls and table surfaces, and that the threads of the family tree lead to a photograph of Vanger at the top."
blomkvist,Would you like to meet him?
erika,Maybe in about an hour.      If you're interested.
vanger,I apologize if you're having financial problems at the magazine in Mikael's absence. ERIKA We'll work through them. VANGER Are you sure?
martin,How long do you think you can hang on? Six months or so? ERIKA That sounds about right.
vanger," You know, I used to be in the newspaper business. We owned six dailies back in the 50's. MARTIN We still own one. The Courier, here in town. 58."
vanger,I let my nephew Birger run it since he can't run anything else.
erika,We've never considered it before. We value our independence.
martin,"Your independence is dependant on advertisers - if we're being honest. However much you think that is, you'd retain. We don't care about content."
blomkvist,Excuse me.   Did I miss something? VANGER We're talking about an investment in the magazine. BLOMKVIST I gather.    Why would you want to do that?
martin,"Not for the return, that's for sure."
vanger, I feel bad that I've take Mikael away from you at the worst possible time. This is the right thing to do. The moral thing. That's one reason.
erika,And. VANGER The enemies of my friends are my enemies. I hate Wennerstrom as much as you hate what he's done to you. Silence.
vanger,So what do you say? 59.
vanger,Is that a maybe? She nods.
vanger,"Wonderful!   More wine, Anna."
vanger,"I think Mikael is adapting well to rustic life, by the way. ERIKA Have you seen him try to make a fire?"
vanger,"Put the logs on end, like this."
blomkvist,Why didn't you tell me? ERIKA Why would I.   You live in the woods. BLOMKVIST So I deserve to be treated like an idiot?
erika,I wanted to hear what they had to say. You would've said no before they could. BLOMKVIST I'm saying it now. It's not a good idea. 60.
erika,You heard me tell them we could hang on for six months. I was lying. Without their money we'll be out of business in three. BLOMKVIST You don't know this family.   They're crazy.
erika,We're not marrying into it.
blomkvist,We are if we do this. It's exactly what we're doing.
erika,"You want to say no? Let's say no. Instead of 50 percent of something, let's own 100 percent of nothing."
blomkvist,What.
erika,So are you coming to bed or not.
tattoo artist,It's sensitive there. Particularly the ankles. It's gonna hurt.
salander,How much do one of those cost?
erika,"We made a serious mistake last year, and we regret it. But we're moving forward, and this is the first step."
reporter 2,You wouldn't say the first step was your sacking of Mr. Blomkvist?
erika,"That's inaccurate. Read the original press release, Viggo. I didn't fire him. He's on sabbatical. REPORTER 2 Where."
erika,"I'm not sure, to be honest with you."
martin,"Millennium is an excellent magazine. We also think it's undervalued right now, which is good business for us."
reporter 3,Is any magazine really undervalued today. How many will be around tomorrow?
vanger,"There's another reason.      I don't like bullies. REPORTER 3 Are you referring to Mr. Wennerstrom? VANGER I'm referring to anyone who tries to sue their enemies into submission. If Mr. Wennerstrom would like to try it again, he'll find himself fighting a company that can afford to fight back. REPORTER 3 You're enjoying this."
vanger,Already it's the most fun I've had in years.
blomkvist,I want to look at what the paper has in its archive on the parade.
blomkvist,I don't think so.
blomkvist,"Nothing probably. But I know photographers. They're the most insecure people on earth. If it's out of focus, or they don't like the framing, they bury it. A119   EXT. HEDESTAD COURIER - ESTABLISHING                   A119"
photo editor,"The current archive is on CD's, naturally. The older stuff, still negatives. What general period are you interested in?"
blomkvist,Thank you.
photo editor,Is this about Harriet Vanger? BLOMKVIST You're too young to know about that. PHOTO EDITOR Everyone here grows up knowing about her. It's how we're taught about strangers.
bjurman,"My dear Lisbeth, how are you? 66."
salander,I need more money. I need to pay my rent. She looks like a schoolgirl with her little backpack over her shoulder. How did he ever get so lucky?
bjurman,Come on in.
bjurman,"Since we're still figuring out what you like, I went shopping for some new toys."
salander,"Me, too."
bjurman,"You, too?    What did you buy?"
salander,I had it with me last time. I set it here. Remember?  See this snap? It's not a snap. It's a wide-angle micro-lens.
salander,"This shows you sodomizing a mentally impaired girl. If it's ever seen outside this room, who'll be institutionalized then?"
salander,Do I have your attention now?
salander,"When you can walk again, which I admit could be a while, we're going to my bank. You'll tell them I alone have access to my account. After that, you'll never contact me again. Each month you'll write a report of a meeting we won't have. You'll describe how well I'm doing, how sociable I'm becoming. Then you'll negotiate with the court to have my declaration of incompetence lifted. If you fail, this video will spread across the Internet like a virus.  69."
salander,No.   Not the video.
salander,I will kill you. And he knows she means it.
salander,"Do you doubt anything I've said?  No, it okay. You can nod because it's true. I am insane."
salander,Lie still.   I've never done this before. 70.
pernilla,Hi. BLOMKVIST Hi.   What are you doing here?
pernilla,On my way to Skelleftea.    I can only stay a couple hours. He arrives and gives her a hug. 71.
blomkvist,What's in Skelleftea?
pernilla,Light of Life Bible Camp. Blomkvist tries to hide his dismay. 129B   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                      129B
blomkvist,"It's fine, Nilla. Whatever you want to do is fine. Everybody needs something."
pernilla,Just so long as it's not God.
blomkvist,I didn't say that.
blomkvist,"I'm not around enough to know everything that's going on with you, and I apologize for that. But I'd never want you to not tell me something, even if you think I might not want to hear it."
pernilla, That's what I'm doing.
blomkvist,It should have been me visiting you. I'm sorry.
pernilla,It's okay.   Everything's good. 72.
pernilla,Bye. BLOMKVIST Bye. The train begins to move.
pernilla,Don't go too hard on the Catholics.
blomkvist,What? PERNILLA The article you're writing. BLOMKVIST What are you talking  -
pernilla,The Bible quotes on your desk.
blomkvist,What?
blomkvist,The Rebecka Case you mentioned. What was her last name if you recall.
blomkvist,Nothing probably.
blomkvist,How was she killed? MORELL O/S Decapitated.   Arms cut off.    Burned.
blomkvist,I'm going to call you back.
blomkvist,What's happened? MARTIN We were talking. He started rubbing at his arm. Then collapsed.
blomkvist,Is he  - BLOMKVIST Go.
blomkvist,"A sandwich? FRODE A Scotch. Blomkvist pours him one, and another for himself."
blomkvist,I don't want to be indelicate. But Henrik promised me something when I agreed to do this. FRODE Wennerstrom. BLOMKVIST  I need to know what he has on him. Now. In case.
frode,In case he dies? That is indelicate. BLOMKVIST And I apologize.
frode,"I don't know what he has on him, if you're asking me. And he can't tell you in the condition he's in. So ... is that it then? Silence.   Blomkvist drinks.   Eventually -"
blomkvist,We also never discussed who I'd report to if something happened to him.
frode,"You'd report to me, but does it matter? We both know nothing's going to come of this. BLOMKVIST I'm not so sure."
blomkvist,I may have found something.
frode, What did you find? Now it's Blomkvist who studies Frode. He's not sure he wants to tell him. And even less so the longer he looks.
blomkvist,"The last time I reported something before I was sure of it, it cost me my savings."
frode,Yes.   Do you have one? BLOMKVIST I can find one.
frode,I know a good one. She did the background check on you.
blomkvist,The.
frode,"Do you think we'd hire anyone for something like this without doing one? Blomkvist's brain tries to quickly inventory his life, pausing at its darker recesses. Frode nods."
frode,"Yes, it was quite thorough. BLOMKVIST I want to read it. FRODE That I couldn't authorize. 77."
armansky,Would it really matter what her name is?
blomkvist,"It would if I wanted to speak to her, which I do. ARMANSKY Against policy. BLOMKVIST You sure?"
armansky,Just like your sources.   You understand. BLOMKVIST Let me give you a name then.
blomkvist,My sister. She's a lawyer.  There's information in here that could only have come from one place. I think you know what I mean.
armansky,The reason you can find no record of her is because her records have been sealed. She's a ward of the State. BLOMKVIST What does that have to do with anything. ARMANSKY She's had a rough life.     Can we not make it rougher on her?
salander,"Who is it? BLOMKVIST O/S Mikael Blomkvist. Her mind races, as Blomkvist's did to the news someone had invaded his privacy. She unlocks the door. Cracks it enough to see him. He smiles, but it's disconcerting. She's not sure it's a harmless one. BLOMKVIST May I come in? SALANDER Actually I'm not really up  -"
blomkvist,That's okay. 79.
blomkvist,I assumed you wouldn't have had breakfast yet so I brought some bagel sandwiches. And tomato juice. Good for hangovers. Where do you keep the coffee? SALANDER Hey.  Hey -  Who do you think you are? BLOMKVIST I'm the guy you know better than my closest friends do. He opens cabinets looking for the coffee.       She stares.
blomkvist,"We have a lot to talk about, so why don't you take a shower, put on some clothes and get rid of your girlfriend. 139   INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - LATER                             139"
blomkvist,That won't be necessary.
blomkvist,Your report on me was quite detailed but for me not very entertaining.
salander,"Wennerstrom wasn't entertained. Blomkvist lets it go. BLOMKVIST Your boss Armansky tells me you only work on things that interest you. I guess I should be flattered. He also says you're the one he goes to for jobs that are, `sensitive' is the word he used. I'll use `illegal,' since that what it was when you hacked into my computer.  I'm not going to do anything about that. I could but I won't. What I'm going to do is tell you a story. If it entertains you, maybe you'll decide to help me research it further. If it doesn't, I'll wash the dishes and leave ... Are you going to even touch your food?"
salander,What kind of research? BLOMKVIST Lisbeth - may I call you Lisbeth? I want you to help me catch a killer of women.
blomkvist,I've identified R.J. Her name's Rebecka Jacobsson.  81.
blomkvist,"We need to somehow figure out who they are, what happened to them, what the Leviticus verses have to do with  -"
salander,"Getting started. You can keep talking if you want. Blomkvist, slightly taken aback, picks up the Leviticus Xerox from the floor. BLOMKVIST Would you like this?"
salander,Got it.
blomkvist,I'm home.
salander,My trainer.
salander,Boxing.
salander,"What? DET. ISAKSSON  Come with me, Muhammad. 161D   INT. KARLSTAD POLICE FILE ROOM - DAY                     161D"
salander,How exactly was she killed?
salander,"Salander. DET. ISAKSSON Miss Salander, if you don't mind my asking, when's the last time you ate? 85."
salander,I have a high metabolism.      I can't put on weight.
frode,"He needs surgery and there's no DNR. So it's up to the family to decide to resuscitate or not, and they're not good at decisions."
frode,How'd it go with Ms. Salander?
blomkvist,She said yes.
frode,He was asleep when I last looked in. We can check. 86.
isabella,"No, you can't check. You can instruct him to pack his things and leave. MARTIN Mother - ISABELLA Don't use that tone with me.  This family's had enough tragedy without you dredging it all up again."
frode,"Actually, Isabella, Mr. Blomkvist works for Henrik. ISABELLA And who do you work for, Dirch? Remind me who pays your salary?"
birger,We should put this to a vote.
martin,"Don't be an idiot, Birger."
birger,It's a family decision like any other. Cecilia?
cecilia,What. BIRGER Am I right?
cecilia,"You are so seldom right about anything, it's hard for me to say yes. But  -"
martin,"No. We should do what Henrik wants, and we know what he wants. ISABELLA Henrik - is in there fighting for his life. This -  - is the last thing he needs."
uddevally detective, All right. Thanks.
salander,Can I make copies? UDDEVALLA DETECTIVE I can make them for you if our machine's been repaired. SALANDER That's okay.
martin,My family is impossible. It's why the company is such a mess.  89.
blomkvist,"It's all right. MARTIN It's not all right, she's unbearable. But it has nothing to do with you. It's between her and Henrik ... She lost it when my father died. The drinking - her state of mind - it all got so bad Henrik took me and my sister away from her, leaving her alone in our old house on the other side of the island like she was excommunicated. She's never forgiven him. And he seems as lost now as he must have been then."
martin,"You have to stay and keep working. You're Henrik's last chance at some kind of resolution. Put this to rest for him one way of the other, and I'll try to keep my mother away. But, please, do it as quickly as you can. BLOMKVIST I'll  -"
blomkvist,"Lisbeth, this is Martin Vanger."
martin,"How do you do. SALANDER Fine. She comes past them without another word. Martin can't help noticing her wasp and handcuff tattoos. Looks after her as she disappears into the cottage. It's hard to believe, but he has to ask:"
martin,Girlfriend? 90.
blomkvist,Assistant. 166A   INT. COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER                           166A
blomkvist,Any trouble finding the place?
salander,Everyone in town knows who and where you are. BLOMKVIST That's comforting. Are you hungry? Want a sandwich?
salander,"No. Busy setting up her laptop on his desk, starting it up, sitting down at it, she's all but ignoring him. BLOMKVIST I used to have a motorcycle.    When I"
salander,I know. She hands him her own dog-eared Bible and a copy of the list of names and initials he gave her -
salander,The five cases from Harriet's list. And five more she missed - three I'm sure about.

salander,"Eva Gustavsson, 1960. A runaway. Raped, strangled, a burnt pigeon tied around her neck. Lena Andersson, 1967, a student. Raped, stabbed, decapitated - BLOMKVIST Okay -"
salander,"I'm not done - BLOMKVIST It's all right, we're looking for a serial murderer ... But what does it have to do with a 16-year-old girl on an island?"
salander,"She was looking for him, too."
blomkvist,Which means they're Jewish names.
blomkvist,I can see why Armansky values you so highly. Your work is very good. SALANDER It interests me.
salander,I can sleep on a couch. BLOMKVIST So can I.
blomkvist,"Okay.  Good night. SALANDER Night. She switches off the lamp.   Then, in a moment, in the dark -"

salander,Have some coffee. BLOMKVIST I will. And then we'll have a talk about what's yours and what's mine.
salander,It's amazing what you figured out from the parade photos.
blomkvist,Thank you.
salander,Too bad you don't have hers.
blomkvist,Whose.
blomkvist,"Can you read that? SALANDER A, C, Three - the rest is blocked. 96."

blomkvist,Carpentry.  Is that a phone number? SALANDER Too small to read.
blomkvist,"I wouldn't think Harald would sign his name like this, would you? 97."
frode,I can't say I know how he thinks.    He might.
blomkvist,Has anyone spoken to him about me since I've been here? FRODE Maybe Isabella. No one else.

tech clerk,I can't give you any of this stuff without authorization from Mr. Armansky.
salander,"So call him. The clerk picks up a phone, but then sets it back down. Picks up the list again. TECH CLERK Next time, I'd prefer you fill out the proper paperwork. A175   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY                                        A175"

clerk 2,I don't recognize him.      Sorry.
blomkvist,I had to start somewhere.      Thanks. As he gathers up the photos to leave -
clerk 2,"I'm no detective, but I think I would've started at the retirement home. Blomkvist looks up.    Not a bad idea."
blomkvist,Brannlund.
forsman,Assar. 100.
blomkvist,"You wouldn't happen to know where I could find him, the son? FORSMAN Next to his father at the cemetery. He was killed in an accident on a job site years ago. But she might be alive -  His widow."
blomkvist,"You were taking pictures, too. Which I'd very much like to see if by some miracle you still have them. MILDRED It wouldn't be a miracle.    We were on our honeymoon. But why?"
mildred,How awful. 101.
mildred,"She does look terrified. Mildred gets up with purpose, goes into another room, returns with a photo album. Leafs past wedding photos, to honeymoon photos and stops on the only one she took of the parade. She hands the album to Blomkvist."
blomkvist,Would you mind if I made a copy of this? 181   EXT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON            181
bjurman,"Ground, please. A finger presses it.    The doors close and the elevator starts down."
salander,How's your sex life?
salander,I didn't care much for your last report.  - SALANDER Don't speak. I don't want to hear your voice. Just nod.
salander,Start looking for a shrink you can bribe to swear under oath he can find absolutely nothing wrong with me. He nods. She gets the elevator going again and steps closer to him. He tries bowing his head like a dog being scolded. She lifts his chin like he did to her before he raped her.
salander,And stop visiting tattoo removal websites or I'll do it again - right here.
blomkvist,It's that bad? 192   INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                      192
salander,Yes. Splits it in two thinner lengths with her chewed finger nails -
blomkvist,What is that -  Is that necessary? 105.
salander,Yes.
blomkvist,We can't just tape it? SALANDER No. She perches on the edge of the tub where he sits - still in his pants - half-submerged in tepid water - bottle of vodka in his hand.
blomkvist,Did you sterilize that? SALANDER No. BLOMKVIST You didn't?
salander,Drink some more. He takes a swig from the vodka bottle. She reaches to his face with the needle and floss -
blomkvist,"Careful, it's my eye."
salander,Don't move.
blomkvist,What am I doing here ... why did I ever come up here ...
blomkvist,"Apart from the fact that I'm old, we work together. SALANDER You work with what's-her-name. That's worked out for you."
blomkvist,"I have some standards of behavior, believe it or not."
salander,You need to stop talking.

frode,"People hunt on the island, Mikael. Gunner's out there shooting something almost every day for his dinner. It could have been a stray shot."
martin,"Not from Gunner. If he wanted to shoot him, he'd have shot him. 108."
frode,We get poachers. They're not always such great shots.
martin,"Or he's right, Dirch.        What if he is? This has to stop. Frode regards Blomkvist."
frode,Do you want to stop?
blomkvist,"I have police reports, photos, Henrik's notes, my own notes, and Lisbeth's research. What I don't have are Vanger Industries records. That's what I want."
frode,Why?
blomkvist,Will you authorize it?
frode,I could but why on earth would I? BLOMKVIST Because I'm asking.
frode,The private corporate records.  How far back?
blomkvist,All the way.
blomkvist,Henrik said I have access to everything I need. This is what I need.
frode,That's not what he meant. BLOMKVIST Let's ask him. 109.
frode,He's not well enough to ask.
blomkvist,"I'd be happy to sign a nondisclosure statement, if that helps you."
frode,Excuse us a moment.
martin,I think Henrik would say yes. FRODE That's why he has me. To protect him from himself. This is insane. MARTIN What do we have to hide?
frode,"Over the course of 120 years of doing business? Plenty. MARTIN If he needs this to do his job, he should have permission. This goes against every privileged, confidential bone in the lawyer's body. He can only stare at Blomkvist and Salander across the room, wondering why he hired either one of them."
salander,What am I looking for? BLOMKVIST Any connections between the company's holdings and the towns where the women were killed ... and everything about Frode.
blomkvist,I was wondering if you could do that.
cecilia,"I don't speak to him, as you know."
blomkvist,You couldn't make an exception in my case.
cecilia,Are you afraid to be in the same room with him? I'm not saying you shouldn't be. BLOMKVIST You won't help me? CECILIA Sorry. 202   INT. VANGER INDUSTRIES - DAY                            202

salander,"Mr. Frode said I have access to whatever I need, and I need this."
lindgren,He said you have access to this floor.

blomkvist,"Perhaps if you redecorated. HARALD Hide the past like they do. Under a thin, shiny veneer. Like an Ikea table.  I'm the most honest of all of them."
blomkvist,The family. HARALD Sweden.
harald,Two point eight.
blomkvist,Pardon me? HARALD The Zeiss Tessar on my Hasselblad. Excellent lens.
blomkvist,"No, it's - I can't tell who it is from this angle."
harald,That's Gottfried's boy.
blomkvist,"Martin? Harald nods, hands it back, smokes. It's not unusual Martin would have joined the search party - it would be unusual if he hadn't - it's his sister that's missing - but this blazer he's wearing troubles Blomkvist -"
harald,"Handsome but useless young man, Martin. Like his father."
lindgren,We're closing. 115.
salander, Nowhere near finished.
lindgren,I'm not staying late.
salander,"I am. And I need access to all the rooms, including any that are locked.  Call Frode. 208   INT. HOSPITAL - DUSK                                     208"
martin," Yes, Ingrid, what's the problem? LINDGREN V/O This girl wants a set of keys now. To my room as well. It's outrageous."
martin,It's fine. Just tell her to make sure to leave the keys with security when she's done.
martin,I stopped at the hospital on my way home. Henrik asked me to ask you something. BLOMKVIST What.
martin,"Come on in, I'll make you a drink."
martin,What happened to you? BLOMKVIST When.
martin,Now.
blomkvist,I fell in the dark. MARTIN You don't have a flashlight?     I'll give you one. BLOMKVIST I just wasn't being careful.
martin,How's the investigation? BLOMKVIST Nothing new to report.
martin,Dirch says Ms. Salander is clever. Maybe she'll turn something up.
blomkvist,Maybe. 122.
blomkvist,Thanks. 222   INT. ARCHIVES - NIGHT                                     222
martin,What?
blomkvist,You said Henrik asked you to ask me something.
martin,I just did.
blomkvist,What?
martin,How the investigation's going.      That was his question.
blomkvist,Oh.
blomkvist,Sure.
martin,Nothing at all?  New. To report. BLOMKVIST No. Martin regards Blomkvist in another silence.        Then -
martin,I can see you're anxious.
blomkvist,No.
martin,To get home.    After your walk.
blomkvist,I suppose I am.
martin,To have dinner. With your girlfriend. BLOMKVIST My assistant.    Yes. MARTIN We'll have better luck with a gun.
blomkvist,Sorry? MARTIN When we go hunting.
martin,A gun.   Rather than a knife.
martin,"You just couldn't stay away, could you."
martin,I want to show you something.     Bring your drink. Leave the knife.
martin,You know what's harder than shooting someone? Just missing them. That was a very good shot up at the cabin.
blomkvist,It didn't work. I'm here.
martin,"Mikael, it did work.     You're here. They come through a pantry, at the end of which is a door."
martin,"Open it. Blomkvist does. Sees steps leading into darkness. As they descend Martin flicks a switch and bare fluorescent tubes flicker on to reveal: A furnace. Washer. Dryer. Old discarded furniture. And another door. A steel one. As they approach it, Martin presses a little remote and the lock on the steel door clicks. MARTIN Push it open."
martin,Switch is on the left.
martin,Why didn't you just go home. BLOMKVIST I assume you mean the opportunity for that has passed.
martin,How'd you do it? What did you find? 126. 126. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
martin,We can talk or we can just get on with it. It's really up to you.
blomkvist,I found a picture no one had seen before. MARTIN Of. BLOMKVIST You. In your Uppsala prep school blazer.
blomkvist,That you lied about where you were that day. Or rather when.
martin,"Did I? If I did, so what.    People lie all the time."
blomkvist,It also said that Lena Andersson was a schoolmate. MARTIN Lena ...  Where's this picture now? With all the other junk on your desk? BLOMKVIST A print is. Digital copies are on a secure photo site. 127.
martin,That's a lie ... How much does the girl know?
blomkvist,"Stockholm.   She went there this morning. MARTIN And that's a lie. She's sitting in our offices looking at more old crap. Our archives manager called me - very perturbed with this girl. Lisbeth. I like that name. Lisbeth. When Lisbeth leaves I'll get a call from security, so I can be at your cottage to greet her when she arrives - He holds up the keys he took from Blomkvist's pocket when he was out cold."
martin,I can't thank you enough for bringing her to me. 228B   INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                    228B
martin,"So what would you like to know? There are so many things, but also no point, so Blomkvist says nothing."
martin,"You're the journalist, ask me something."
martin,You can't be a sloppy technician like that.   You can't drink to excess like he did. This takes discipline. It's a science of a thousand details. The planning. The execution. The cleanup. I'm sure I don't have to tell you you're going to make quite a mess.
martin,That's the interesting thing. Because most of the time I am just like everyone else. I just have a bigger secret. It's wonderful really - standing there waiting for a train - or on a street corner as people brush past me. You know what I mean;  you have secrets. You had one when you came up here. It made you feel - special. Didn't it?
martin,Can I ask you something? Why don't people trust their instincts? They sense something's wrong - someone's walking too close behind them - yet they don't cross the street. You knew something was wrong - you even knew what it was - but you came back into the house. Did I force you? Did I grab you and drag you in? I just offered you a drink.  You'd never think the fear of offending could be stronger than the fear of pain - but you know what? It is. They always come willingly.
martin,Say something.
blomkvist,You are a sick fuck. MARTIN ... Is this an interview or an editorial?
martin,"You're right, this behavior is unacceptable. I know that. But we're not completely different. We both have desires. Satisfying mine just requires more towels. Martin regards Blomkvist in a silence.    Then -"
martin,Anything else you want to know?  All right. Whatever you say.
martin,What happened to her.
blomkvist,You're choking me - MARTIN You found her? BLOMKVIST You killed her.
martin,You useless fuckin detective. 132.
martin,Too tight to talk? It is.   Blomkvist can utter no sound but a gag.
martin,Good.   I'm tired of talking to you.
martin,It's time. I don't want to be late for my date with our girlfriend. 133. 133. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
salander,May I kill him?
blomkvist,He has more guns in the den -
salander,I know.
salander,Dead. 234   EXT. HEDESTAD - DAWN                                       234
salander,Asleep.   Coffee? There's no milk.
salander,Sad.
salander,I said it's sad.
frode, What do you know about this?
frode,I have to talk to  -
salander,Let him sleep.
frode,What are we going to do?
salander,"We're going home, Mikael and me. I don't know what you're going to do."
frode,I'm going to the police.
salander,Show them the videos while you're at it.
frode,The - Salander points to a stack of video tapes. 137.
salander,Would you like to see them?
frode,No. 236A   INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM - LATER - MORNING                      236A
blomkvist,How is it someone who's 23 is a ward of the state?
salander,I'm mentally incompetent and can't manage daily life.
blomkvist,Since when have they said that. SALANDER Since I was twelve. BLOMKVIST Something happened when you were twelve?
blomkvist,"It's all right, you don't have to tell me anything -"
salander,I tried to kill my father. I burned him alive. Got about 80 percent of him.
blomkvist, Oh.
salander,I think so.
blomkvist,"Martin didn't deny killing anyone. But when I mentioned Harriet, he was confused. He was angry - at me - for not being able to tell him what happened to her.  What if she did somehow get away? Could she have done that? Could she have done it alone? He goes up to his wall of suspects."
blomkvist,"Is she's alive, there's only one person in this family who would know where she is."
blomkvist,"I have to go away for a couple days. When I come back, I hope to have an answer for you. Such a possibility stuns the old man. He regards Blomkvist a moment. Then Salander ... VANGER Would the young lady mind giving us a moment of privacy."
blomkvist,"She's my partner, Henrik.     She should stay. A tiny, tiny, tiny smile finds its way to her face at the mention of the word `partner.'"
vanger,What have you found?
blomkvist,I'm not sure.
vanger,Don't treat me like a child.      Tell me.
blomkvist,I can't.    I don't know.    I need a week.
vanger,I've waited forty years.     I can wait another week.
blomkvist,I always liked this song.  You don't? 140.
salander,"I don't like classical music. A strange-looking young man comes in, regards the strange- looking trio at the table, comes over. To the fat man -"
trinity,Plague?
plague,Trinity. SALANDER Wasp.
blomkvist,... Mikael.
salander,The money.
blomkvist,"Fuck me. He watches Anita Vanger get out of the car - the garage door come down - light go on inside the house - then dark figures hurrying along the side of the house: Trinity, Salander, and finally Plague. They climb into the van with their tools, firewires, a laptop. None speaks as they tether cables to computers in the van. Blomkvist just watches. Finally, to him -"
salander,It's your turn. 141.
blomkvist,It's me.   Sorry to bother you.
blomkvist,No one's called you?
anita,About.
blomkvist,Your cousin.
blomkvist,Martin.
anita,What about him?
blomkvist,"He died last Thursday. A car accident. I'm sorry.  There's going to be a memorial in Hedestad. I know you haven't been back there in a long time, but - ANITA I'm not interested in any memorial."
blomkvist,I understand.
anita,What do you understand?
blomkvist,"That you don't really care for any of your relatives. Still, I thought you should know."
anita,Now I know.
blomkvist,Okay.   I think.
trinity,She's on.
blomkvist,"Do we have her cell, too? Salander points to one of the windows on the screen. His hand comes off her shoulder. 143."
blomkvist,I was so she'd lead us to her.
salander,Put your hand back on my shoulder. He does.   They watch the solitaire game together ... SALANDER There's only one reason she wouldn't call Harriet. She can't because Harriet is indeed dead. 247   INT. HOTEL ROOM - LONDON - LATER - NIGHT                       247
salander,Ten more seconds. That's fair.   She finishes.    They lie there.     Then -
salander,"Okay, what."
blomkvist,"I was just thinking, there could be one other possibility."
blomkvist,May I? ANITA What is it now. He comes in and sits.
blomkvist,I want to show you something.
blomkvist,"Before he died, your brother hung me from a hook ... Harriet. 250   EXT. PARK - LONDON - DAY                                   250 They sit together on a park bench."
blomkvist,"Anita married in Stockholm in 1967. It's recorded in the Swedish General Register. But the family never knew, did they.  I'm guessing she then came here on a passport in her married name, and you followed on her maiden name passport. HARRIET Actually, it was the other way around. She thought it safer for me to travel with Spencer myself."
blomkvist,"What did he think about that? HARRIET Nothing. Only that he loved her. She said, If you love me, you'll do this and not ask why. He never did."
blomkvist,They both died twenty years ago.
harriet,"A car accident. You found that, too."
blomkvist,"Is this you? He hands her the less graphic of the two Polaroids Salander found in Martin's basement - the young girl, face turned half-away from the camera ... HARRIET I was 14 the first time he raped me."
blomkvist,Martin. 145.
harriet,"No, my father. He took this picture. Martin didn't start until he died."
blomkvist,Henrik would have done something.
harriet,Would he? I don't know. I almost told him. But I was afraid because of what I did.  You still don't understand?
harriet,He dragged me back to the cabin ... All I'd accomplished was substitute one rapist for another.
blomkvist,How'd you get away? Anita? 255   INT. VANGER MANOR - DAY - 1966                             255
anita,Don't take anything. Harriet puts the clothes back.     Picks up her purse.
anita,"Leave that, too."
harriet,How did you get away?
blomkvist,"Someone saved me, too. 148."
vanger,"I'm fine.   Thank you, Anna. Anna leaves. Closes the doors.      Before Blomkvist can say anything else -"
vanger,I made you a promise. Whether you found out anything or not.
vanger,Now.   What do you have to tell me.
frode,"I don't think I'm seeing the point. BLOMKVIST Yes, you are. FRODE  It happened in the 1970's ..."
blomkvist,"Come on, he knows you can't try somebody for this 35 years later. I like Henrik, but he knows that. Frode disagrees -"
frode,A man's reputation used to mean something - he still believes that. I'm sure he thought you could destroy Wennerstrom with this in the court of public opinion.
blomkvist,"The ""court of public opinion,"" Dirch, makes celebrities out of girls who shop. Henrik promised me Wennerstrom's carcass on a plate. This isn't even the plate. I can't do anything with this. 150."
frode,Of course you're right ...  I'm sorry. 262   EXT. VANGER MANOR - LATER - DAY                          262
salander,Fuck these people ... BLOMKVIST Yeah ... SALANDER Harriet most of all.
blomkvist,Excuse me?
salander,"If she'd done anything but run, Martin wouldn't have been able to kill all those women. BLOMKVIST She had no idea he was doing it."
salander,She should have killed her father and him. BLOMKVIST That's what you would've done.     Not everyone's you.
blomkvist,That was meant to be a compliment. Put your arm back on my shoulder.
salander,What happened with Wennerstrom. How did he get you? 151.
blomkvist,"I was stupid. I got something from an anonymous source, who I'm sure now worked for him. It was fake. Which he easily proved in court. Not a good day, that.   Then - SALANDER You were emphatic that the way I looked into your life was illegal and immoral. Would you feel the same about Wennerstrom?"
blomkvist, On Wennerstrom.
blomkvist,"Wennerstrom's Swedish assets are genuine, but they're the only things that are. The rest is funneled through companies in Gibraltar, Colombia, and Macao. These companies produce no products and provide no services. They're shells. They launder money from arms and drug sales, and crime syndicates in Russia. And that money - which accounts for all but 5-percent of his holdings - ends up in accounts in the Cayman Islands. It's a completely illegal, criminal empire."
erika,How do you know this? 152.
blomkvist,This time you don't want to know.
erika,"This time I do want to know. BLOMKVIST I have access to his computer, and his accountants' and lawyers'."
erika,And how do you have that? BLOMKVIST I could have gotten it from a source inside the company. ERIKA But you didn't.
blomkvist,But that's what you'll say.
erika,But what will you say to me?
blomkvist,That depends on if you really want to know.
erika,"I do.   Who gave you access? What looks like 16-year-old tattooed runaway lets herself in with her own key. Crosses past Erika with a paper bag, takes out two bagel sandwiches, the same kind Blomkvist brought when he barged into her apartment. As she puts some water on for coffee, Erika looks at Blomkvist. He nods. Yeah. Her."
announcer,"In the current issue of Millennium magazine, he now charges the same company that successfully sued him - The Wennerstrom Group - of criminal activities on a global scale - backing it up with internal financial reports, bank records and emails - annotations almost as long as the article itself."
blomkvist,He'll call it a personal vendetta but it won't work. FI can't ignore banking and securities fraud like this. The police can't ignore the organized crime stuff. They'll both have to investigate.
salander,Then.
blomkvist,"We'll be back in court, but this time it'll cost him. That's probably it, though. These guys never to prison."
blomkvist,What's wrong.
salander,It's embarrassing. BLOMKVIST What.
salander,I need to borrow some money. Blomkvist grins and reaches for his wallet. 154.
blomkvist,I don't know that I have that much.
salander,You do. I'm sorry that I know that. You have 65 thousand in your two accounts. He's no longer shocked or dismayed by her knowing more about his personal affairs than he does.
salander,You'll get the money back.   I promise. 267   INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - DAY                          267
