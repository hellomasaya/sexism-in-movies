Speaker,Dialogue
stephan,Breathe.
sarah,Their mission had been to return him to Israel to stand trial. Instead it ended with his death on the streets of East Berlin...
young agent,David Peretz?
david,Yes.
young agent,You were expecting me?
david,Yes. I was expecting you. YOUNG AGENT Would you come with me sir?
david,Let's go.
david, Sorry.
young agent,"What, sir?"
david, I - I think I...
sarah,When are you going to stop?
rachel,Stop what?
sarah,The smoking.
rachel,Soon.
sarah,I hope so. Do it for your grandson.
sarah,Are you sure you have to go back home tomorrow?
rachel,"It's all arranged, I'm afraid..."
sarah,But we'll have breakfast before you go? I thought maybe we could take a walk on the beach?  I'd like you to see more of him.
miriam,I've marked the place. I thought perhaps from chapter eleven...?
rachel,"...Yes, thank you."
sarah,"If you'd rather read something else, mother....."
rachel,"No, that's fine."
miriam,You must be very proud.
miriam,And I'm sure you were invaluable in the research.
sarah, I'm the only journalist in Israel she won't speak to.
rachel,I thought he couldn't come.
sarah, So did I.
stephan," Please, sit, sit. My God, it must be election season."
sarah,You came.
stephan,I came. So you're the famous author I've heard so much about?
rachel,Stephan.
stephan, Who's this handsome devil on the cover?
sarah's husband,She was wonderful.
stephan,"That's good. Good, good. That's very good."
miriam,I just want thank you all for coming to help us celebrate the launch of this wonderful book. I'm sure we're all particularly thrilled to have two of the heroes of this story at the table. And even more thrilled that one of them has agreed to read for us...
rachel," ""On the evening of the 31st of December, it began to rain more heavily. So isolated had they become from the outside world that it was only when she looked out of the window that Rachel remembered it was New Year's Eve..."
rachel, He's driving too fast.
stephan,We're going to David's apartment.
rachel,David...?
stephan,I keep track of people Rachel. It's my job.  I know he came to see you yesterday.
rachel, What's this? The jealous ex- husband or the intelligence officer?
stephan,A little of both. What did he want?
rachel,Fuck you.
stephan,What did he tell you?
rachel,"He didn't tell me anything.  He didn't! He told me where he'd been travelling, that he'd been teaching... We spoke for a few minutes and then I had to go."
stephan,My car's waiting outside. It can take you to the airport.
david, How was your trip?
rachel, Fine. Everyone sends their love.
david,You've cut your hair.
david,I'm David.
rachel,Rachel.
rachel,Where do I sleep?
stephan,You're in my room.
stephan,What do you think of your new wife?
david,Too young.
stephan,Pretty.
david, I don't know.
stephan,"Two years. All the places we've been to. You don't look at women. Before I get into that bed, is there anything you have to tell me?"
stephan,"Well, well...I think he just noticed."
stephan,Yes?
rachel,Argentina.
stephan,Really? Whereabouts?
rachel,Cordoba.
stephan,What were you doing there?
rachel,My husband is an Industrial Chemist.
stephan,He does look like a chemist.
rachel,Before Argentina we lived in Hungary where my husband studied...
stephan,And what did you do in Liaison?
rachel, Translator.
stephan,"So, first time in the field. Rachel feels herself blush a little angrily. Stephan grabs her from behind and Rachel executes a perfect break, twisting Stephen's arm. Stephan winces, surprised."
david,Welcome to Metsada.
david, I'll be waiting for you.
rachel, I won't...be long.
nurse,Frau Roget?
rachel,"Good morning, doctor."
vogel,"Alright now, just relax. We're going to do a little examination. If you feel at all uncomfortable, you just say. Alright?"
rachel,Twenty five.
vogel,And how long have you and your husband been trying for a baby? RACHEL Nearly two years.
vogel,"Uhuh. Well, the ovaries look fine. Alright, let's see... your cervix is slightly retroverted. Tilted backwards?"
rachel,"Really? The angle from which we next see VOGEL, and the way the image of his face freezes in black and white, tells us clearly that this locket conceals a CAMERA DEVICE."
vogel,Mmm. But that generally shouldn't affect fertility.
rachel,"Oh, good."
vogel,"You have a slight accent, Frau Roget. Where are you from?"
rachel,Argentina. We just moved here... A few months ago.
vogel,Whereabouts in Argentina? Buenos Aires?
rachel,"Teatro Colon. He turns back to her, holding a swab, the warm smile."
vogel,"That's right. Beautiful. This might sting a little, dear."
stephan, So. Everything...?
rachel, Next appointment is on Wednesday.
stephan,Bitte sehr.
stephan,"One, two, three, four, five, six..."
stephan,Usually.
david,...and the stairs to the platform are sealed off.
stephan,"...here. And they will be empty. Once that train has stopped, the guards won't be able to see this fence. And on the other side of the fence is..."
david,We're just one more parcel. Once we're in West Berlin there'll be transport to Templehof airbase and a private charter.
stephan,That's the wrapping. Now all we need is the present. Rachel realises both men are looking at her.
rachel,Try this on.
stephan, Nice.
rachel,Black belt in dressmaking.
rachel, What is it?
david, It doesn't have a name.
stephan, Shit.
david, Now it does.
rachel,"Uh, at ten - study the Mishnah, at fifteen - study the Talmud. By eighteen - stand under the wedding canopy... STEPHAN We're too late for all of those."
rachel,"Uh...twenty. In your twenties you are to ""pursue your life's goals."""
stephan," What are you pursuing Rachel? Rachel thinks about it, shrugs."
rachel,I don't know. I'm waiting to find out.
stephan, Youth...
rachel,"What about you, grandfather? Have you got a goal?"
stephan, Oh yes. We believe in goals in my family. We're very driven men. My father was Director of Collections by the time he was fifty.
rachel,So what's your goal?
stephan,Director of Collections by forty.
rachel," What about you David. What ""life goal"" are you pursuing?"
david,This is it.
rachel,"Seriously, what do you want out of life?"
david, I want this. I want to get Vogel. I want him to be put on trial and I want the world to watch so everyone knows what he did. I want them all to know the truth.
david,And...I want another drink.
stephan,Forget about it.
rachel,Forget about what?
stephan,"I've spent two years with him, and I don't know him. Nobody knows him. He's alone."
rachel,What about family?
vogel,This is my hand. This is the speculum.
rachel, What?
vogel,Who told you about me?
rachel,Who... told us?
vogel,"Were you referred by a doctor, or...?"
rachel," Oh, Doctor Eisenberg."
vogel,Ah-ha. How is the old Jew?
rachel,Very good.
vogel,Any history of infertility in your family Frau Roget? RACHEL No.
vogel,Are your periods irregular?
rachel,Yes.
vogel,Yes. I think we've found the problem.
rachel, None.
vogel,An only child?
rachel, I lost my mother in the war.
david,Are you alright?
stephan,Identity is confirmed. We have a green light.
david,It's a brave thing you're doing.
rachel,I'm not brave. I'm terrified.
david,But you're doing it anyway. Because you know how important it is.
david,You're very brave.
rachel, David...
stephan,It's whiskey.
vogel,"Alright, this is my hand. And this is the speculum."
rachel,Okay.
vogel,You had intercourse last night?
rachel, Yes.
vogel,Good. You're at the most fertile stage of your cycle. This is very good timing.
rachel,What about your patients in Birkenau...?
nurse,My God! What happened?!
rachel, I don't know! I don't know! He just clutched his chest and collapsed!
nurse, I need an ambulance! Karl-Gustav- Strasse. The clinic. My husband has had a heart attack.
nurse,"It's Frau Bernhardt, please, please hurry!"
high shot,"As Stephan races up some steps, along a balcony, and into the building..."
tracking," with Stephan through the hallway, out of the door and onto the street...."
nurse," Oh god! Come on, come on! Hurry!"
rachel,They're here. Stay with him. I'll go and get them...
stephan,We need to take him to the hospital. He and David open up the stretcher and transfer Vogel to it with some efficiency.
nurse,Oh God!
stephan,He's going to be alright.
david,"I'm sorry, Madam, but you'll need to meet us at the hospital."
nurse,But... I want to travel with him.
david,Not possible I'm afraid. New regulations.
rachel,"Don't worry, he's in good hands now. He's going to be fine."
nurse,Thank you...thank you.
rachel,"You should get your things, go to the hospital to meet him."
stephan," I know, I know."
stephan," One, two, three, four, five, six..."
stephan," Twenty, twenty one, twenty two..."
worker,You new?
rachel,First shift. The girls said it was okay to come out for a smoke....
worker,"Yeah, it's okay. Are you working until midnight?"
rachel,Yes.
worker,After the late shift most of us go to the Vetter. Do you know it?
worker,...it's just on the corner. You should come along.  She glances through the fence and down the track to where the train's LIGHT can be seen approaching in the gloom. This is it.
driver,There's something on the tracks up here!
rachel,"Well, maybe I'll see you there? I finish in half an hour. Why don't you go and get me a drink ready?"
worker,Half an hour then.
worker,What was that...?
david, Fuck.
rachel,I think it came from over here?
worker,"No, it was one of those..."
border guard,There's nothing there. Get moving now!
first guard,What are you doing here?
rachel,I work here. I'm on a break.
first guard,"Show me your papers, both of you."
stephan, We have to go!
stephan,We can make it. Help me with him...
first guard, You can go.  The Worker gratefully hurries away. Rachel is watching tensely as the Second Guard closes on the van...
stephan, We're going! Now!
david,Not without her.
second guard, Hey! Over here!
stephan,Down!
stephan,Is he dead?  Is he dead?
rachel,Who?
stephan,The Guard! The one who saw your face! Is he dead? RACHEL No.
stephan,How did he come round? How the fuck did he come round? You gave him the full injection?
stephan,Did you give him the...
rachel,I don't know! I thought I...
stephan,Jesus Christ!
stephan,We could have gone!
david,It's not over.
stephen,We could have fucking...!
david,WE STILL HAVE HIM! IT'S NOT OVER! We still have him.
rachel, What did he say?
rachel,You made contact?
rachel,What did he say?
david,"It's going to take time. They need to open up a new route, they need to find political help. Maybe the Americans. Two weeks... maybe three."
david,We work four shifts guarding him. We feed him at the end of each shift. We never leave him alone.
stephan, And you're compromised. You don't leave the fucking house.
david,We can do this. We just need to stay focussed.
vogel, .....Fucking assholes! Fucking pig shit food! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck...
bedroom, He continues to swear at his captors as best he can through his gag. Rachel tries to block out the sound with her blanket.
david, At this rate he's going to starve himself to death before we can get him back.
vogel,My wife.
stephan,You can't talk to him.
rachel,I didn't say anything.
stephan,You can't listen to him.
rachel,I know. I just... STEPHAN  I'm not angry -
rachel,Good.
stephan,Fuck!
vogel,Why don't you just kill me now?
vogel,"I know what you want. You want to hand me over to the others, let there be some fucking sham of a trial. Then, when they kill me, you can tell yourself that there was no blood on your hands."
david,What happened? What's the matter?
rachel,Nothing. He...nothing.
david,What?
rachel,He can understand every word we're saying. He just spoke to me.
david,It's alright. It's alright. It's nearly over.
rachel, Why didn't you go? At the station. You could have got away. Why didn't you?
david,Stephan? STEPHAN It's not happening.
david,What the fuck does that mean?
stephan,The Americans have pulled out.  Has he been fed?
david,So...so what does that mean?
rachel,Oh God...
stephan,Did you feed him?
david,What does that mean? What's the plan now?
rachel," We just need to get him to the airfield, there must be some other way, some..."
stephan,I said has he...?
stephan, Now answer the fucking question: Did you feed him?
rachel,YES! I fed him!
stephan," There's no plan. There's no fucking plan. They said the operation is being ""re- evaluated."""
stephan,You know what that means? They're going to cut us loose.
stephan,It's a fucking mess and they're backing away from it quickly as they can.
stephan,It's happening. I can feel it.
rachel,They can't just leave us!
stephan,Yes they can! Because we fucked it all up! We fucked it all up and now we're on our own!
david,Were you followed?
rachel,Stephan? Stephan is hurriedly screwing the SILENCER onto the GUN. There's another KNOCK at the door.
stephan,"If it's them, he dies."
david,You're not doing this.
stephan,He's not getting away from me.
david,This isn't the mission.
stephan,"I decide what the mission is! If I say he dies, he dies."
david,We're finishing this mission. We're taking him back.
stephan,Get out of the way!
stephan,Rachel. Rachel!
rachel, It was the lady from the bottom apartment. She invited us to her New Year's Eve party.
david,What are you doing?
stephan,It's your shift.
david, Did you know about this?
rachel,About what?
david, His mouth's taped. You want him to suffocate?
stephan,I was sick of seeing his face. Go back in. DAVID Don't do that again.
stephan,You don't give orders David. It's your shift now so you can go back in there...
rachel,Stop it!
david,"We're not animals. Just remember what we are. Remember what we're not.  He walks back out. Stephan sits back at the table, starts eating again. He glances at Rachel, but she won't look at him. After a moment she gets up and walks out."
rachel,I have to get out.
david, Rachel...
david,She wants to go out.
rachel," No one will see me. Tell him, David. I just want to walk. I just want to get some...air. Please."
stephan,Don't be stupid.
rachel,GET OFF ME!
vogel,Thank you. David.
david, Shut up.
vogel,I am expressing my sympathy. For your suffering.
david,What does a monster like you know about suffering?
vogel,"I'm a doctor, David."
david,A doctor. You blind children trying to change the colour of their eyes. You inject people with petrol. You...you replace people's hands and legs and you watch as they...
david, There's no answer. I'm not looking for an answer. I'm not looking for...
vogel,You're trembling.
stephan,Out. We're going out.
vogel, Thank you...
on rachel," ...as she finishes with the pots and notices the pieces of shattered bowl scattered around Vogel. She kneels down in front of him and collects up the pieces. She glances up at Vogel, checking him. He is still slumped, eyes closed.  We TRACK with her as she walks back into the kitchen. From the living room comes the three distinct PINGS of rainwater dripping in the pots.  She drops the pieces of bowl into the bin and stops, puzzled. It's a moment before she works out what she's noticed - something has changed in the sound of the rainwater next door. There only two drips instead of three.  She walks back towards the living room...  RACHEL'S P.O.V - through the living room door we can see that one of the pots has been overturned. Rachel slows to a stop. A sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn but...it's too late. Vogel steps out of the alcove he's been standing in so that he is directly in front of her. Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open with a SHARD OF GLASS.  Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face. Vogel grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her, tries to worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her throat with the glass.  Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel drops the shard. He swings wildly at her, but Rachel ducks the fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face. Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudden pain of the blow.  Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by blood from her wound washing into her eyes.  As she wipes her eyes clear, Vogel grabs a LAMP from a small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her face. She falls.  Vogel begins to run, but, driven by adrenaline and desperation, Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at him, catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards the front door.  Vogel stumbles, manages to pull a leg free and stamps down on Rachel who lets go with a moan. He stamps again, steps free and kicks her hard in the head."
stephan,Nothing. Not a trace. Nothing at all.
david," He's not going back to the house. He's gone. Fifteen years, it took them to find him. And he's gone. And no-one's going to find him again."
stephan,So we what? We...are you going to make the phone call? Are you going to tell them how he got a fucking piece of broken bowl? Wonderful. But don't try and take me down with you. I've done nothing wrong. Remember that!
rachel,I take responsibility. It was my shift. DAVID  This happened because of me. I let him go. And no-one's ever going to find him again.
stephan,No-one's ever going to find him again.
rachel,What are you talking about?
stephan,"Only four people know what happened in this room. Us, and him. And he's not talking. No one will ever hear from him again."
rachel, No.
stephan,Nobody needs to know what happened here.
rachel,"He escaped. STEPHAN That's the truth. But that doesn't have to be the truth we take home. The truth can be anything we want it to be. The truth is Vogel tried to escape, you struggled with him and got hurt. The truth is, seconds before he got away, Rachel got the gun and shot him. The truth is we got rid of him.... got rid of the body... got rid of every trace of the Surgeon of Birkenau."
rachel,We can't lie about this!
stephan,"No, you know what? We have to. We have to! This is...this isn't about us. This is about Israel. This is a national humiliation! We can't be seen to fail. And in the end, Vogel rots away his life in some jungle, looking over his shoulder, waiting for the bullet...? Who's to say...?"
david,He's gone. What does it matter? He's gone.
stephan," He's right. It makes no difference. No difference. All we have to agree is that we never talk about this. No matter what happens, we never tell anyone. The truth stays in this room. Between us. Agreed? Rachel looks at David again, wanting some kind of sign."
david,Agreed. Silence. Rachel closes her eyes. Instead of relief she feels a kind of immense disappointment.
rachel,David...?
stephan,Rachel? Say it. It's an oath. Say it.
rachel, How could this happen? You said he would never speak! You said he'd never...
stephan,We don't know it's him.
rachel,Oh God! Oh God!
stephan,If you read it...
rachel,"He's alive! He's in the Ukraine! What else is there to read? STEPHAN This is a little internet story. ...""a psychiatric patient claiming to be the Surgeon of Birkenau..."" Some crazy old man. No-one is paying this any attention. Yet."
rachel, How did you find it?
stephan,"David comes back after all this time, I want to know why. I had his apartment searched. This was on his computer..."
rachel,No!
stephan,Because he couldn't handle it. I told him we had to deal with it and he couldn't handle it. He thought it was all going to come out and he panicked...
rachel, What does that mean? Deal with it?
stephan, I told him to find Vogel. I told him to finish it.
rachel," Did you know he'd been ill? Did you...? You knew, didn't you? You killed him. YOU killed him! You knew he wasn't strong enough..."
stephan, FUCK DAVID! I don't want to hear about David! David took the coward's way out!
rachel,You could have left it alone! It's an old man in a hospital! You said - nobody will believe it! No-one will notice!
stephan,There's a journalist.
rachel,What are you talking about?
stephan,David's taken himself out of the equation.  I can't do it. You're the only one left.
rachel,Are you insane? STEPHAN We can't...
rachel,I'm not...Look at me! I'm not capable of...This is insane. I can't do this.
stephan, And there's Sarah. It's as if he's struck her. Beat.
rachel,I won't do this.
rachel, I always knew this would happen. I knew we'd be punished. I knew we'd have to pay.
stephan, I thought I'd already been punished.
rachel,God doesn't plant car bombs.
stephan,I wasn't referring to the wheelchair.
rachel, She isn't going to find out.
stephan,My car's waiting outside. It can take you to the airport.
rachel,How can I?  How can I?
rachel, Cigarettes please.
waiter, What can I get you?
rachel,Just a coffee.
rachel,"At that moment, I don't think I was thinking about myself at all. I was thinking about my mother. I was thinking about how she had suffered in Europe. The FACES of the soldiers, moved by this. One raises a hand."
soldier,The same question to Mr. Peretz.
stephan, Fuck him.
stephan,Fuck him.
rachel,"Go to bed, Sarah."

registrar,Mr. Schevchuk is in room 414. Visiting time starts at eleven o'clock. You can take a seat over there.

rachel,Yes. I've heard of you.
nurse,Hold the doors please.
stephan, Yes?
stephan, A family matter... Would you give me a moment?
rachel,It isn't him. It's over.
rachel,You were wrong.
rachel,About David. You were wrong about him.
stephan,About David?
rachel,"When he came to see me, he was asking me for something."
rachel,My permission. And I didn't give it. I wouldn't let him tell the truth and he was tired of living with the lie. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09 109A.

rachel, I want her to be proud of me.
