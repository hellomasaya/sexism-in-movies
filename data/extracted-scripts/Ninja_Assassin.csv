Speaker,Dialogue
hollywood,Fuck!   Fucking-shit-fuck-fucking- fuck!
hollywood,"Watch it, old man!"
tattoo artist,The needle is doing what the needle does.
hollywood,What's that supposed to mean?
tattoo master,"The irezumi does not hide the skin, the tattoo reveals the nature of the man and illuminates the four noble professions in the Book of Five Rings: the Warrior, the Artist, the Merchant, and the farmer. If there is a conflict between the needle and the skin, between the mark and the man, then perhaps the path you have chosen is not the path for which you are suited."
hollywood,"What did you just say, old man?"
tattoo master,No disrespect.
hollywood,You're lucky. I can't kill you 'til you finish this thing. Gimme that mirror! How's it looking?
yakuza one,"Hey, boss. This just came for you."
hollywood,What is it?
yakuza one,A letter.
hollywood,"So open it, dumb ass."
yakuza one,Looks like sand.
tattoo master,No...
hollywood,You know what this is?
tattoo master,"Years ago, I watched a man open an envelope like that one."
hollywood,What came out of the shadows?
tattoo master,I cannot say the word.
hollywood,What word?
tattoo artist,"That night, one of their blades struck here. I should have died, but for an accident of birth. My heart is here, on the other side."
hollywood,What the fuck is that?
yakuza one,"Looks like a Ninja, boss."
hollywood,A ninja? Are you kidding me? That's the word you're afraid to say? Ninja?
tattoo artist,"But you are real, aren't you?"
checker,That's a lot of noodles.  Are you a student? Tourist?   Here on business?
raizo,I don't think so. Sorry.
checker,"So if you're not a student, and you're not a tourist, and you're not here to work... what are you doing?"
raizo,Waiting.
checker,For what?
raizo,For the wheel to turn.
ozunu,"...you must never, ever forget who you are, how you came to be. You are Ozunu. You are a part of me as I am a part of you."
raizo,Is everything all right?
landlady,"Yes, fine, it's all fixed. You keep it very dark and spare in there."
raizo,"Ms. Ali, my privacy is very important to me. If you enter my apartment again without my permission, I will leave your building."
landlady,I just --
raizo,Good day.
ozunu,"On the street. Abandoned by your parents. Without a home. Without people to care for you. You should have done as most children do, and gone quietly from this world, to the next.  But, instead you fought. As you did here today. You fought. And you won."
mika,"Some people see money as the root of all evil, but to me it looks like a fingerprint. Whether we're talking about 19th century Korea, or 21st century Iraq, the game is the same. If you want to understand why certain things are happening, you have to understand the flow of money."
maslow,"You're excited, Mika. You know I get nervous when you're excited."
mika,You remember the Eulmi incident?                    *
maslow,"Korean queen, late eighteen-                         * hundred's. According to you, she was off'd by one of these ninja clans."
mika,Ozunu. I think. I've been going through some of the original transcripts of the trial of Kunitomo Shigeaki. The prosecutor questioned him about a payment of 100 pounds of gold. Shigeaki answered that he didn't know what the prosecutor was talking about. The question was never brought up again. But what pinged for me was the amount- the exact same amount rumored to be paid to the Hattori Clan for the assassination of Lord Sanda.
maslow,"So you start to wonder, in this ever changing world, if the cost of a man's life has remained constant."
mika,Exactly. I figure these clans are like a thousand years old. They probably don't change a lot.
maslow,Highly circumstantial.                               *
mika,I thought you might say that so I checked how often this particular bank transferred that market equivalent to a hundred pounds of gold in the last three years.
maslow,Let me guess.
mika,Not once.
maslow,Okay you got me. This is                                * interesting.                                            *
mika,"The clans are real, Ryan. They                          * steal children and turn them into                       * assassins. They've been doing it                        * for years and nobody's doing a                          * damn thing to stop them.                                *"
maslow,"Look, no one's denying the historical record, Mika. But the whole idea just doesn't fit in with a modern world. It's like one of those questions on an IQ test: which of these doesn't belong in this sentence: laptops, space shuttles, nanotechnology, ninjas."
mika,"They're real Ryan. You can call them spooks, or assassins, or whatever you want if it makes you feel better, but they're out there. They're killing people and nobody is doing a damn thing to stop them."
ozunu,Our enemies are everywhere.
ozunu,You must move without trace or                       * footprint.
pretty woman,Hi... excuse me...?  Would you mind?
raizo,...sorry?
pretty woman,"If it's not too much trouble, could you help me with this?"
raizo,What clan are you from?
pretty woman,I... don't understand...
raizo,You came alone. The Ozunu clan would never make such a mistake.
manager,What is going on-
maslow,"And two cokes, please."
mika,"How long have you been here? And you can't say ""zwei cola bitte""?"
maslow,"Course I can, but you tend to hear more interesting things if people don't know you can understand what they're saying."
mika,Do you ever stop being a cop?
maslow,"Not the way I was raised. My dad always said, being a cop has nothing to do with a clock. It's a consequence of consciousness often interpreted as desire."
mika,Desire?
maslow,For justice. And doughnuts.
mika,I think so. Same template as before. The transfer was made the day before a multiple homicide in Osaka. The police and newspapers are calling it a gangland slaying.
maslow,"How do you know what the police report says? You're not still requisitioning evidence with my clearance codes, are you?"
mika,What about the bank audit?
maslow,Denied.    It was a long shot at best.
mika,But you said you found something.
maslow,"A report. A friend of mine in Moscow, tipped me to it."
mika,What happened to him?
maslow,"Same thing that's going to happen to me, if I keep hanging around with you- booted out of the service for mental instability."
mika,Is he still alive?    We need to find him.
maslow,Working on it.
mika,"You believe it now, don't you?"
maslow,Ninjas?    Are you kidding?
mika,Then why are you doing this?
maslow,No idea-
ozunu,"Hunger and thirst, your bowels and                   * breath, even the blood in your                       * veins, are the body's weaknesses.                    *"
ozunu,The world feeds on the weak.
ozunu,Suffering exists only because                       * weakness exists.
mika,...who are you?
ozunu,Hone your body. Sharpen your mind. Become the weapon you will need to survive.
raizo,You shouldn't do that. It's against the rules. If they catch you --
kiriko,Then they catch me.
raizo,They'll put you in the box.
kiriko,"Yes, they will."
raizo,Trees don't have hearts.
kiriko,Everything has a heart.
raizo,I don't.
kiriko,Really? Let me see.
raizo,Liar.
kiriko,"Listen to mine, I'm not lying. I'll prove it."
mika,Excuse me? Excuse me?
asian man,"Ahh, Jona.    Jona sick."
mika,"Oh. Well, tell him I hope he feels better"
asian man,Take care.   You should take care.
mika,...What?
asian man,Work so late. Not good for you.
mika,True...Thanks.
mika,...is someone there?
ozunu,Did Takeshi's blow hurt you?    You                   * think this is pain? You are                           * mistaken.                                             *
maslow,"Last night I'm working late and I get a visit. Guy named Zabranski. Works upstairs for Internal Affairs. Just drops by. In the neighborhood- cup a sugar- how ya doin- kinda thing. Asks what I'm working on. Oh, this and that, usual blibbity blab, I tell him. Then he smiles and says-"
zabranski,...Very Good.
maslow,"I don't understand what is really going on, but I'm smart enough to recognize a warning when I see one."
mika,But why?
maslow,"Why? It's obvious. If your little fantasy has even slightest chance of being real, then these Nine Clans would have some pretty major juice protecting them."
mika,What are you going to do?
maslow,"We are going to tip-toe, very carefully from here on out. You understand? You don't do anything else without checking with me. Got it?"
mika,Did you find Sabatin yet?
maslow,Yeah...he's dead.
mika,How?
maslow,Heart attack.
mika,They killed him.
maslow,"People die of heart attacks, Mika."
mika,Was he married? Did he have a family?
maslow,"God, you are relentless, aren't you."
mika,"I know you Ryan, you would have checked."
maslow,A wife.
mika,Still in Russia?
maslow,Relocated.
mika,Where?
maslow,Explain something to me first. Where is this obsession coming from? What started this whole thing?
mika,Like your father said...It's a consequence of consciousness often interpreted as desire.
maslow,Desire for what?
mika,For the truth.
maslow,Mika! Tip-toe!
ozunu,A true Shinobi lives in darkness. The night is his weapon.                             *
mika,Mrs. Sabatin?
mika,I'm with Europol. We spoke on the phone.  GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT     6/4/08   33. 36   CONTINUED:                                                   36
mika,Shoen.
mika,I found it...illuminating. Especially the references to the Rihla. Your husband quotes passages not found in Battuta's present manuscript.
mika,I understand the report caused some problems for him inside the KGB.
mika,What happened?
mika,Do you know what they talked about?
mika,Can I ask how he died?
mika,What're you --
maslow,I told you to stop using my confirmation code.
mika,I did --
maslow,"Dammit, Mika --                                    *                                                44"
mika,"...I'm sorry, it was the only way                    * I could get the evidence.                            *"
maslow,Shit....
mika,What happened?
maslow,What happened? Everything's fucking happened.
mika, DNP.
maslow,That's right. DNP. DO NOT FUCKING PURSUE!
mika, Actually that would be DNFP --
maslow,"Right now there are people from internal affairs, CIA, Homeland Security and for all I know the Martian Fucking Military in my office tearing the place apart.  I don't know what they're looking for but I think you do."
mika,Most of this is from Sabatin. Copies of what I think are the lost chapters of the Rihle. I think it describes the original location of the Ozunu Clan but my 14th century Arabic is a little rusty.
maslow,And this?
mika,"That's how it started. I made a mistake, mixed up the case code and they sent me that."
maslow,...Christ.
mika,Yeah. I know. I don't understand why they're fighting though. It could be a clan war.
maslow,So you requisitioned this by accident. You used my code which is why you didn't want to show me this. Which is also why they're tearing apart my office right now.
mika,"I'm sorry Ryan. You have to know I didn't mean for you to get in trouble...  I just thought if this was real, if these clans were killing people, you know, it was our job to try to stop them."
maslow,"Okay, that's low."
mika,"Look, I know I broke the rules. I'll explain what I did and accept the consequences."
maslow,"Very noble of you but I've got the feeling this isn't a slap-on-the wrist kinda consequence. Let me take this and try to make some sense of this shitstorm you started. In the meantime, you will not say anything to anybody. Capiche?"
passport official,Are you coming to Berlin for business or pleasure Mr. Han
raizo,Pleasure.
zabranski,Boy you're like a dog with a bone on that computer aren't you?
mika,Excuse me? Who are you?
zabranski,"Agent Zabranski. Internal affairs. Need to ask you a couple of questions. You are Mika Coretti, yeah?"
mika,...A few cases.
zabranski,You have something of a social relationship.
mika,What?
zabranski,You had lunch with him on the 13th and again on the 18th.
mika,How do you know that?
zabranski,Is it not true?
mika,"I...I'm not sure. We do have lunch together sometimes, usually when we're working-"
zabranski,Are you working on something with him right now?
mika,No...not right now.
zabranski,"Has Agent Maslow seemed different lately, in any way? Has he done or said anything that struck you as unusual?"
mika,No why. Has Agent Maslow done something?
zabranski,"Just routine. The agency cares about its field operatives. We monitor for signs of stress, fatigue, mental exhaustion. Agent Maslow has a serious case load. That much work can wear on a man."
mika,Come on...you're kidding me.
maslow,"Ssssshhhhhh.   Sorry, Mika."
mika,"Fucking Christ, Ryan-"
maslow,I couldn't talk earlier.   They're watching me.
mika,Zabranski came to my office. Asking about you.
maslow,I know how Sabatin must have felt.
mika,What happened?
maslow,I showed Jamison the materials.
mika,What did he say?
jamison,This agency is subject to the International laws and agreements that govern the jurisdiction of our authority. If a case is marked DNP we must respect the jurisprudence of the regional government and act accordingly.
maslow,I understand that sir but-
jamison,"Let me be clear, Agent Maslow. In the eyes of the law these materials do not exist. If so, than there is no case and if there is no case there is no reason for this conversation to continue."
mika,He took the materials?
maslow,"Come on Mika, how could he take something that didn't exist? He couldn't. Which means that I couldn't copy it either, and if I couldn't copy it than I can't be violating international laws and agreements by still having it."
mika,What are we going to do?
maslow,Your going to go home. Pack your bags and go on holiday.
mika,No way-
maslow,"Don't fucking argue with me, Mika. I trusted you. Now you've got to trust me."
mika,"Ryan, I can't let you lose your job because of me-"
maslow,"I'm not talking about my job, Mika."
mika,I've never even fired one of these.
maslow," This is the bad end. This is the end you hold. Point, shoot, run like hell."
mika,Ryan...
maslow,"I know. It's unbelievable. I've investigated, world bank officials, drug cartels, arms dealers, and I've never faced this kind of heat. For ninjas. Fucking unbelievable!"
mika,Hey....
neighbor,Hi.
mika,What happened?
neighbor,"Power's out. Us, the building behind us, that one across the street. Seems like every few months, boom, the lights out. I call, I complain, they listen...nothing gets done. So I sit out here, at least it's cool."
mika,You're not the first person to give me that advice today....
raizo,You know me?
mika,...security camera in New York.                        * Recorded you fighting...one of                         * them.                                                  *
mika,A little.                                              *
mika,Who?
raizo,The Hanta-Kirra.
mika,Does that mean what I think it means?
raizo,They won't stop until you are                         * dead.                                                 *
mika,Oh god.                                               *
raizo,The gun won't help you.
mika,"I don't have a lot of options okay. I once took a Tae Bo class, but that's the extent of my Kung Fu abilities."
raizo,I can help but you must tell me                       * something first.
mika,What?
raizo,You saw Ms. Sabatin.                                  *
mika,But I can get them.
raizo,We need something black. Hurry!                      *
takeshi,Raizo.
dog ninja,He's taken the girl.
ozunu,Betrayal begets blood.
ozunu,This is the law of the Nine Clans. This is the way of the ninja.
mika,I'm going to have to make a phone call in order to get the manuscript.
raizo,Not now.   Just drive.
mika,Where?
raizo,Does not matter. Just get as far away from here as fast as you can without drawing attention.
mika,You think they're following us?
raizo,I know they're following us.  GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT     6/4/08   53. 63   CONTINUED:                                                   63
mika,I don't see anything back there.
raizo,They have our scent.
mika,Following our scent?    Like dogs?
raizo,No. Like Wolves.
mika,How do you know so much about them?
raizo,I was one of them.
mika,You flunked out of ninja school or something?
raizo,...something.
ozunu,You may remove the blindfold.
kingpin,Wait here.   Gotta piss.
bodyguard,"Want me to come with you, boss?"
kingpin,Why? So you can shake it for me? You some kind of secret faggot?
kingpin,The fuck-?
ozunu,Keep it. It will remind you that every minute of your life is a gift that I have given you.
mika,"Okay, if you're not going to say anything, do you mind if I talk? When I get nervous, it helps if I talk."
raizo,I know.
mika,"Yeah, well usually if someone introduces themselves it is a convention that the other person does likewise."
raizo,Raizo...is the name I was given.
mika,"So, you were an orphan?"
raizo,Ninja only kill two kinds of people. The first kind has power and money. The other kind is trying to stop them.
mika,I understand retail therapy as well as any girl but I think it's a little late.
raizo,You are a size 36?
mika,What? No! Size 34...`cept certain times of the month.
raizo,If you leave while I am gone they will catch you and kill you.
raizo,Get undressed. Shower. Do not use the hotel soap. Or any towel. Do you smoke?
mika,No.
raizo,Put your clothes in here.
mika,Hey-
raizo,What?
mika,Don't you know how to knock?
raizo,I'm trying to save your life.
mika,...okay right.
raizo,Dry yourself with this.
mika,...I'm just a researcher. I'm really not equipped to deal with this...
raizo,Get dressed.
mika,These are a little tight.
mika,European sizes...run a little small I guess.
raizo,Let's go.
mika,Wow. They teach you that at ninja school?
raizo,Most locks are not worth the metal they're made of.
mika,You're going to steal a car?
raizo,Just borrow it.
mika,"In for a penny, in for a pounding."
raizo,At ninja school I minored in electrical engineering.
raizo,Now we have some time.
mika,How much time?
raizo,A day.    Maybe less.
mika,Jesus.
raizo,Make your call.
mika,"Ryan, it's me."
maslow,Mika! For Christ sake I've been calling for hours!
mika,I know.   I'm in a bit of trouble-
maslow,Trouble? You miss jury duty you're in trouble. You're in some kind of bottomless pit of deep shit.
mika,Yeah. Least I'm not down here by myself...
maslow,Your guardian angel? Is it him? The one from the tape?
mika,"He's on our side, Ryan.   I trust him."
maslow,"Careful, Mika."
mika,I promised him the Battuta pages. Do you still have them?  GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08   64. 77   CONTINUED:                                                    77
maslow,"...yeah, I got them."
mika,Can you meet us? In three hours?
maslow,Where?
mika,How bout the usual?
mika,There he is.
maslow,Mika!
mika,Thanks to him.
raizo,Why have you done this?
mika,Done what?
maslow,Step back Mika.
mika,What?
raizo,People will die.  GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08     65. 78    CONTINUED:                                                     78
maslow,NOW!
mika,No!
military man,Hands on your head! On your knees! Do it now!
mika,Raizo!   No!   This is wrong!
raizo,The clans have people everywhere.
mika,What are you doing?
maslow,Following orders.
ozunu,Cut him.
security goon,Prisoner is secure sir.
maslow,Right.
security goon,"No sir, we checked it."
maslow,Then why isn't he showing up?
security goon,We think he's able to lower the temperature of his body to remain neutral.
maslow,Or maybe he's just cold-blooded.
mika,"Ryan, you know this is wrong!   It can't be legal! What is this place? Your own private Guantanamo?"
maslow,It's an old GDR safehouse. Jamison wants this off the grid.
mika,Ryan you're making a huge mistake!
maslow,"I don't think so. We got reports from Washington, London, Osaka all tagging your boy. Only problem we have is where to extradite him first."
mika,"So two weeks ago, there's no such thing as a ninja and now every city in the world has a warrant for one?"
maslow,We must respect the jurisprudence of the regional government and corresponding law enforcement agencies.
mika,He's not the enemy.
maslow,No? You ever heard of Stockholm Syndrome I'm getting the feeling I'm looking at a pretty serious case of it.
mika,I'm not crazy.     This is!
maslow,"He's a killer, Mika. Weren't you the one telling me it was our job to stop him."
mika,You're not listening to me!
maslow,"You're not saying anything worth hearing. Look, if want to do the insubordination tango, let's go, but not in front of the kids okay? Boys, give us a minute."
mika,"Damn it, Ryan, I --"
maslow,"Listen to me, we don't have much time. Look, I don't know what you've stumbled into, but somebody is pulling some major strings inside."
mika,They want him dead. He's been fighting them for years.
maslow,I believe you.  -- because I don't want anything to happen to you.
raizo,I told you.   I tried to warn you.
kiriko,"...yes, you did...."
raizo,But you did it anyway.   Why?
kiriko,Why am I in here for watering my tree...or why are you out there... watering me?
mika,Could you give us a moment?
guard,Negative.   Not safe ma'am.
mika,If he wanted to hurt me he could have done that a while ago.
guard,Sorry ma'am. Maslow okayed the water. That's it.
mika,Hi...you looked thirsty.
raizo,I know.
mika,You do?
raizo,The only time you lied to me was when you told me your size.
mika,How did you know that?
raizo,Your heart.   It is special.
mika,You know about my heart?
raizo,Hearts speak truer than tongues.
mika,"Listen, Maslow is on our side. He's going to try to help you."
raizo,It's too late. All that matters is the Rihla. Get the manuscript before they get here.
mika,The Hanta Kirra?
raizo,Hurry.
mika,"Ryan, can I talk to you?"
maslow,"We have to do this again, Coretti?"
mika,No sir. I just...I have reason to believe that a group of ninja may be on their way here.
maslow,I think these gentlemen can handle a few whack-jobs wearing pajamas. Am I right?
mika,But the situation we discussed-
maslow,I'm working on that. You have to give me a little time.
mika,We don't have time.
maslow,They're not here now.
mika,They'll be here soon.
maslow,How soon-
mika,Raizo--
maslow,Mika!
europol guard,Christ--
europol guard,We got some guys in pajamas comin' to play spin the bottle.
mika,I don't have time for this shit. We have to move the prisoner.
raizo,Mika!
raizo,You've got to get out of here!
mika,Not without you.
raizo,Then we all die together.
point man,Is that..?
mika,Fuck me...
europol guard,They're not showing up on IR!
mika,Come on--come on--
raizo,Mika?
mika,Shh!
raizo,I don't want to sound critical--
mika,Got it!
raizo,Go. Find Maslow.
maslow,Mika!
mika,Jesus Ryan--
maslow,I thought you were--
mika,Are you ok?
maslow,I hope that wasn't my liver. Gonna need that soon.
mika,Come on.
mika,Fuck!
maslow,What?
mika,The manuscript--
maslow,No Mika--
mika,Maslow--
mika,"Come on, Ryan..."
mika,Ryan- I had to leave!
maslow,"Good, stay clear."
mika,Do you have the map?
maslow,Not yet.   We're heading upstairs now.
mika,Where's Raizo
maslow,He took off.   We think they went after him.
takeshi,"This is the end for you, brother."
mika,Raizo!
raizo,...waiting for you...
mika,You have to go to a hospital.
raizo,No. Not a hospital.     Another place.
herbalist,What is it?   What --
raizo,...dong-xia leaves...three of the lo-chan...dragon root...
herbalist,You should not mix these.    Very dangerous.
raizo,No...it will save me....
herbalist,It will?  You're sure?  Let me write this down.
raizo,Hot water.
mika,A day?!?     What should I do?

mika,I'll have him to go.  Can you...help me to the car?
maslow,"Mika, where are you?"
mika,Moving.   He told me to keep moving.
maslow,He's still alive?
mika,After a fashion.
maslow,Let us bring you in.
mika,Not this time.
maslow,"Mika, the situation's a little different. Jurisprudence goes out the fucking window when my men get attacked."
mika,Do you have the manuscript?
maslow,...negative. They got to my office. Everything's gone.
mika,...but I promised...
maslow,We'll keep your promise. They're too many people involved now. It's just a matter of time.
mika,I don't think we have much time...
maslow,Just tell me where you are.
mika,"I know you can't hear me, so I'm sure this doesn't matter, but I'm going to say it anyway."
aide,"Agent Maslow, the tracking device--"
maslow,You've got a lock?
aide,Triangulating her position now.
mika,They took him.     Ten minutes ago. He's gone.
raizo,...no!
raizo,Kiriko!   You can't leave!
kiriko,I have to.
raizo,Why?
kiriko,Because my heart is telling me too.
raizo,The Hanta Kirra will come for you.
kiriko,Then they will come.
raizo,You know the law. He will cut your heart from your chest.
kiriko,No...He can never touch my heart.
raizo,Where? What is out there?
kiriko,Life.
raizo,...My life is here.
kiriko,Because I can't watch you become something you are not.
ozunu,"A child of mine, my daughter, betrayed us. She refused these gifts. Rejected our clan."
ozunu,"You are Ozunu. Your life is meaningless compared to the survival of the Clan. This is our deepest truth. Because of it, we have endured for hundreds of years, and will endure for hundreds more."
takeshi,Father...
maslow,"No more grenades, not until we get the children out!"
raizo,What took you?
mika,You knew I'd come?
raizo,Just because I was asleep doesn't mean I couldn't hear you.
takeshi,"Come, little brother, let us play like old times"
ozunu,"You have not forgotten your training. You will always be mine, child."
raizo,"The breath I take after you are dead, will be the first of my life."
mika,Die you fuck!
ozunu,Bitch!
mika,Raizo
raizo,Mika! Run!
mika,Where is he?   I can't see him!
raizo,Get away!
maslow,Mika!
raizo,She saved my life.
maslow,How can you be sure?
raizo,Her heart is special.
mika,Medic!    Over here now!
maslow,Is she going to be okay?
medic,"I don't know...she's got a hole right through the middle of her heart...but shes not really bleeding, that badly..."
mika,My heart...
maslow,...you gotta be fucking kidding me.
mika,...Raizo?
maslow,He said you saved his life.
kiriko,I believe the heart of a tree knows which way it needs to grow.
raizo,I don't.
kiriko,Hello...hello in there. It said it was happy to meet me and that it missed you.
kiriko,Come with me!
