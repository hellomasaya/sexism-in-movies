Speaker,Dialogue
vaughn,"Thank you, Paul Lohman, for that eloquent solo. Now, for that point in the ceremonies where we formally dedicate this magnificent resort- hotel complex, a worthwhile addition to the recreational paradise we call Amity."
ellen,Where the hell were you?
brody,Late.
ellen,I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
brody,"Couldn't help it. Hendricks over there...  ...still has the keys to the jeep in his pocket, and I couldn't find the spares."
ellen,Terrific. Act as if you've been here all along.
brody,How'm I supposed to do that?
ellen,Look bored.
vaughn,"...And now, Tina Wilcox, this year's Miss Amity, will cut the ribbon that officially opens this luxurious new hotel..."
vaughn,"Tina was selected from more than 20 of this island's lovely young ladies in the Miss Amity competition held every spring, and she'll represent Amity Island in the Miss Massachusetts Competition in Worcester next month. When she cuts this ribbon, she will be opening our island to growth, to development, to planned expansion with full employment for our thriving community."
lucy,I don't think she's such hot stuff.
polo,When are we going out? You and me?
lucy,Not tonight.
polo,You going with Patrick?
polo,"Listen, Jane -- you want to dance as soon as we get out of these monkey suits?"
sean,"Mom, Michael won't talk to me."
brody, Shouldn't he be at home?
ellen,Mrs. Silvera couldn't come.
vaughn,"This money tree, you may have noticed, is made entirely of twenty-dollar bills, donated by Len Peterson, the builder of Amity Shores Condominiums, as a gesture of goodwill towards the community. $500 as a special gift to the Amity township scholarship fund..."
vaughn," Go ahead, Tina."
vaughn,"Thanks to Tom Andrews, of Amity Aqua- Sports, for contributing the special decorations. And now, the Amity High School band. Refreshments on the patio, everyone..."
brody, Do I have to talk to those two?
ellen,My boss and your boss. Sure.
vaughn,"Hello, hello. It went well, I thought."
brody,Very impressive ceremony. Good speech.
vaughn,"Thank you, thank you. You know my son, don't you?"
peterson,"The speech was right on the money.  Be a love and make sure the bar's open, will you?"
peterson, Fantastic lady. Don't know what I'd do without her.
brody,Me neither.
peterson," Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town."
brody,"All of us thank you, okay?"
ellen,Watch Sean for a minute?
sean,Can I go swimming?
brody,"No. Find your brother, okay?"
mike,How old is your cousin?
brooke,Seventeen. She's a senior.
mike,I'm not crazy about blind dates.
andy,"They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups."
brooke,That's awful.
andy,What the hell.  Did your mom put all this together?
mike,"Yeah, it's her job."
andy,Is she responsible for the punch?
mike,No.
andy,Good. It's terrible.
brooke,My cousin will be here tomorrow.
mike,Great.
sean,"Michael, Michael, Dad said to find you."
andy,"Okay, you did that."
sean,"Come on, Mikey, come on..."
mike,"Okay, okay. Got to go."
tim, Okay. Later?
doug,Get a dance yet?
timmy,Nope.
doug,Me neither.
timmy,Who'd you ask?
doug,Tina Wilcox.
timmy,You're crazy. She's Ed's girl friend.
doug,Doesn't hurt to ask. Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
timmy,That's a crock of shit.
doug,I know.
bob,Same tired old faces. You see Vaughn?
doug,The mayor?
bob,"Larry Vaughn Junior?  If you see him, tell him I got a six- pack, a blanket, and the Brebner twins."
timmy,No class.
doug,None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
brody,Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
ellen,Why?
brody,Because they're playing our song.
peterson,May I have this dance?
brody,"Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear."
brody,"Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?"
ellen,And how. I thought you wouldn't respect me.
brody,"I did, I did."
brody,Listen -- what are you doing later?
ellen,Fooling around?
brody,Right.
ellen,Let's get the kid home.
brody,Home it is.
brody, You're getting a little big for this.
brody,Mmmm.
ellen,MMMmmmorning...
brody,Sean's awake.
ellen,Door's locked.
brody, Good.
sean's voice,The milk fell out of the 'frigerator.
ellen, Put a towel down. And shh -- daddy's sleeping.
sean's voice,Okay.
ellen,C'mere...
brody,Mrs. Silvera?
ellen,Mrs. Silvera.
brody,Need a ride?
ellen,As far as the office.
brody,Some people.
sean,What's daddy doing?
ellen,Writing a ticket.
ellen,Hey! That's my boss!
brody,Better yet.
peterson,Wait a minute...
brody,"Too late, it's written."
peterson,"Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?"
ellen,Do I have to?
peterson, Better get a sales kit together for after lunch. I'm taking some prospects out.
ellen,See you later.
peterson, Can't we fix it up to get this made into a green zone or something?
brody,"Len, pay the two dollars."
hendricks, Tie it off on your left. Your other left!
hendricks,Good morning!
brody, Aren't you off-duty?
hendricks,"Till noon. This is on my own time.  Hi, Shorty."
sean,I'm not short. I'm eleven.
skipper,Yo! Chief!
brody,What?
skipper,You got a gold-plater drifting in the main channel. Big cruiser.
hendricks,Whereabouts?
skipper,"Off the Point. No running lights, just a diver's flag."
hendricks, Want me to run out there?
brody,On your own time?
hendricks,Happy to do it.
brody,Then check it out. I'll be in the office.
hendricks,Cast off your bow line. And your stern line. Spring line...
brody,Where to?
mike,No place special. Just hanging out.
brody,Sailing?
brody,"Watch your kid brother, huh?"
brooke,"Bye, Mr. Brody."
polo,Anyone want to sail to the lighthouse?
patrick,Machs nix to me.
lucy,Anyone got a spare mooring line? Mine's shot.
tina,I've got one...
sean,Can I go too?
mike,No.
sean,Please.
mike,"I said, 'No.'"
brooke,"You're not going out right away, are you?"
mike,Waiting for Andy.
brooke,I want you to meet my cousin.
mike,"I will, I will."
sean,"I want to go out with you. You need a crew, don't you?"
mike,I don't need you. Andy's here.
sean,You always go with Andy.
mike, How was dive class?
andy,"Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble- bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean."
brooke,Shells and lobsters and stuff?
andy,Mostly old garbage. Today we found a '48 Hudson.
sean,Do I have to play with the little kids?
mike,"Yeah. Go on, beat it."
jackie,Brooke! Hey!
andy,Who's that? Quick -- I'm in love.
mike,I hope that's the cousin.
brooke,Over here. I want you to meet somebody.
andy,"Lucky. Lucky, lucky, lucky."
jackie,How fast does this go?
andy,"With the right wind, 15-20 knots."
jackie,What?
mike,Real fast.
brooke,Far out!
larry,Coming up!
bob,"Gangway, Turkies!"
andy,We're carrying weight.
larry,We'll take your supercargo.
jackie,Is that me?
brooke,That's you.
jackie,I've never been supercargo.
larry,"Hey, get out of our air!"
donny,Want a passenger?
bob,Way to go!
hendricks,"Rich or poor, it's nice to have money."
red,Figure they split?
hendricks,Happens every season -- someone takes off. Once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting.
andrews,This is all there is.
hendricks,"If that's it, that's it."
indignant man,"I can't watch the news, I can't watch a ball game, I can't watch movies -- all I hear is that rotten kid with his rotten radio... ""Breaker, Breaker..."""
brody,"I'll do what I can, but you're talking about a federal jurisdiction..."
indignant man, So call the FBI!
polly,"Black, two sugars."
brody,Thanks. What else is out there?
polly,"One petty theft, one domestic disturbance, and an exhibitionist."
brody,"I'll take the exhibitionist, you handle the others."
woman,Chief Brody? I want you to do something about my first husband.
brody,"In a minute, in a minute -- talk to Mrs. Prendergast, please..."
woman, Albert keeps coming around when I'm with gentlemen friends and he throws mud on their cars...
2nd man," Every time there's an out- of-state car in my driveway, I lose another mailbox. Those little iron sailboats cost thirty-two dollars each!"
brody, Talk to me about Mrs. Kinney.
brody,Dancing?
hendricks,Chief...
brody,Hendricks. I want to go over your
brody,"I just made it up. It means, ""Get me out of there.""  What the hell's that?"
hendricks,Diver's camera. Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
brody,Abandoned? It's a little early in the season for that.
hendricks,"Rich people. Home port is Newport, Rhode Island."
brody,"If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel."
hendricks,"If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation."
brody,"Hendricks, get a description of that dance."
large man," Chief Brody? I want to talk to you about my daughter... she's 15, but mature for her age..."
woman,"Chief, I've been telling Mrs. Prendergast that it's no good just talking about Albert, she's got to do something..."
2nd man,"Look -- the township is responsible for protecting life and property, and my property is unprotected..."
terry,Did you ever see a dolphin?
diane,Sure. They like to play. We may see some today.
terry,Great!
terry,"Whoops, almost lost one. Can't play with the dolphins without skis..."
diane,Ready?
terry,"Hang on, hang on... Okay, go."
tina,"Take a break for a minute, okay?"
ed,Huh?
tina,"Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing? We can use my Uncle's boat. Eddie?"
ed,Next week.
tina,"With you, everything's next week. I want to go skiing soon. Tomorrow?"
terry,Faster! Faster!
terry,Porpoise! Look! A dolphin!
diane,Terry! You okay?
terry,Help! Help!
diane,"Okay, okay, coming..."
diane, Terry!
diane,"Help! God, help!"
diane,No-o-o-o-o-o...!
hendricks,"I can't find anyone out here. They must've gone to the bottom, or drifted with the current."
brody,"There should be bodies. Witnesses say two people; one in the boat, one skiing."
brody,Try dragging.
brody,Stay on it. I don't care how long it takes.
tina,"We heard this noise, like a 'boomp' out there, and when we looked, there was just this cloud of smoke."
grace,"That was the explosion. One minute they were having a wonderful time, the next, bang!"
grace,I don't know what could've done that.
tina,Can we go now?
tina,Chief Brody -- can we go? Please?
brody,"Oh, yeah. Sure."
red,How much longer?
hendricks,Until we find something.
red,"I don't care about the overtime, I'm hungry. And cold. And most of all, bored."
hendricks,I think we got something.
red,About damn time.
hendricks,What the hell is it?
hendricks,Here it comes...
red,Oh shit. Drop it.
hendricks,What is it?
red,Power line.
hendricks,"Oh, great."
red,It comes here from Cable Junction.
hendricks,Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
red, Now you're talking. Let's get out of here before we do find something.
ellen,You have to smoke so early in the morning?
brody,It's good with coffee.
ellen,So's a donut.
sean,I want Fruit Loops!
mike,Eat Cheerios.
sean,You eat Cheerios. I want Fruit Loops.
ellen,Eat Cheerios.
brody,What're you guys doing today?
mike," I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing."
brody,Every day?
mike,What else is there to do?
brody,"You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school."
mike,Do I have to?
brody,You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
ellen,Where's my day book?
brody,In the den.
ellen,"He doesn't have to work all the time, it's his vacation."
brody,There's a lot going on.
ellen,Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
brody,"Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat. He's another one."
ellen,One what?  Ah-ha!
brody,Boat nut. What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
ellen,It's an island.  Got to run.
mike,I'm going.
brody,What about tennis? Riding? Fixing up old cars? Bartending?
brody,"Okay, not bartending. Why on the water every day?"
mike,Because.
brody,"Look, humor the old man -- just be careful."
mike, I'll be careful. I'll see y'later.
brody,"Don't go out if it's rough or anything, huh? We've had a lot of trouble."
mike,"Okay, okay."
sean,Can I go with you today?
brody,"You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?"
sean,All right.
brody,I'll be at the office.
sean,"Bye, Daddy. I'm going to be careful, all day."
lucy, Where're we going?
andy,"Oh, out a ways. Maybe the lighthouse."
brooke,The lighthouse?
andy,"No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic."
mike,We got some stuff at the store. Ed and Tina are going to be there.
brooke,"Oh, sure, they would be."
jackie,What's the lighthouse?
mike,"It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse. We sometimes hang out there, you know..."
jackie,Great. I got some wine.
brooke, The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
jackie,Now I really want to see it.
brooke,"You going to fool around with Mike?  Well, I'm not doing anything with him."
jackie,"Well, maybe I will, then."
ed,Come on back up here!
tina,Nope.
ed,Give me back my hat!
tina,Double nope!
andy,Why'd they decide to move?
brooke,Too hot in the lighthouse?
mike,Too hot for those two? I can't believe it.
jackie,Is there something I don't know about?
brooke,"I told you, remember?"
jackie,"Oh, yeah. So why aren't they doing it now?"
andy,Maybe by now they are.
mike,They're moving pretty fast.
jackie,He's cute...
tina,Yech!
brody,"As soon as I heard about it, I called you. This thing is big!"
elkins,"After we've looked, we'll talk."
hendricks,This is it.
hendricks,"Move back, please... back off... open it up a little..."
brody,See? What'd I tell you?
brody,Look at that!
elkins,First things first.
elkins,"From the tip of the snout, please."
elkins,"Length, 22 feet, 8 inches."
brody,"Come on, let's check the bite radius."
elkins, The what?
brody,"Bite radius. You know, the size of the mouth?"
elkins,The whale's mouth?
brody,The Shark's mouth.
elkins,What shark?
brody,"The shark that did this. It was a shark, wasn't it?"
elkins,"We don't know that, do we?"
brody,"But that's what we're here to find out, right?"
elkins,"You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?"
hendricks,I can't hear you if you're going to whisper.
mike,Can we go now?
brody, You stay here a minute.
mike,"Oh, c'mon."
brody,You heard me.
jackie,We'll be over by the lighthouse.
mike,I'll be right there. Wait up.
elkins,Could be a shark. But maybe not.
brody,"Look, I know a little bit about sharks."
elkins,Do you?
brody,I know that this was probably a Great White Shark. Car-cadon... Caradan...
elkins, Carcharadon Carcharias.
brody,That's it.
elkins,"Okay, so that's it."
brody,Is there one in these waters?
elkins,What makes you think there might be?
brody,Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish...
elkins,"This is a mammal, not a fish."
brody,"Jesus, don't quibble with me. I want to know if a Great White Shark did this."
elkins,Probably.
brody,"That's it? Probably? Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around..."
elkins,And sound.
brody, Sound?
elkins,"Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low-frequency vibration."
brody,So there's one around here.
elkins,"Not necessarily. These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more. None of them are immediately fatal. Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further."
hendricks, We got a helluva tide this month.
brody,"Could you just keep that crowd back, please?"
mike, Pop...
brody,You stay right here. You're going in with me.
mike,We came out in my boat.
brody,Andy can sail in it.
mike,I got a date!
brody,She'll understand.
mike,She won't.
elkins,"Lower jaw displaced and lacerated by predator attempt to seize the tongue. Additional large tissue loss in the dorsal and sub- dorsal areas, as well as the caudal. Oriamal bite radius 37 inches, allowing for salt-water erosion and subsequent small predator and scavenger tissue attacks..."
brody,I don't want to discuss it.
elkins,"It's either a Great White, or another killer whale."
brody,Can't you tell?
elkins,"Not when it's like this. This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least. Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite."
brody,"Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate? Send out signals, or something? You know, take revenge, sense an enemy..."
elkins,Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally.
mike,"Dad, please..."
brody,"No more sailing. You come back with me, and that's it."
mike,Why me?
brody,Because I say so.
andy,"I'll tie up at the town dock, don't worry, man."
jackie,"See you later, Mikey..."
vaughn,I'm showing summer rentals. We got a helluva season going.
brody,"We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone."
vaughn,We're alone.
brody,"Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one."
vaughn,Are you serious?
brody,"Of course. Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator..."
vaughn,"No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing. Be realistic."
brody,"I got a feeling. I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?"
vaughn,"Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money."
brody,We have to do something.
vaughn,"We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know."
brody,"I know, I know..."
vaughn,"And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches! In New England? We all lost on that one."
brody,It's still a good idea.
vaughn,"Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have everything you want; right now, the town's broke."
brody,"Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers..."
vaughn," A tragedy. But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident."
brody,Two of them are still missing!
vaughn,There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up. Are they all shark victims?
brody,Maybe they are!
vaughn,Bullshit.
brody, Bullshit? I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
vaughn," What am I, an ass? When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything."
brody,Someone has to do something.
vaughn," Don't push it this time. If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that."
vaughn,I've got to get back to work.
brody,"Come on, give a guy a break."
brody,Come on. Here boy. Come to Poppa...
brody,Hoo! Cold!
brody," Come here. Come on, Sweetheart. You bastard. A little closer... Here y'go..."
brody, Gotcha!
hendricks,Chief?
brody,In here.
hendricks,I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
brody,"You didn't miss much. Christ, what a mess."
hendricks,Positive I.D.?
brody,The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
hendricks,Oh.
brody,What about that camera?
hendricks,What camera?
brody,"That one -- from the wreck. You brought it up, did you look inside it?"
brody,"Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing. Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it..."
hendricks," If there is, develop it!"
brody,You got it.
hendricks,I know just where to go.
brody,Not the drugstore!
hendricks,"Of course not, They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place. He'll do it for me."
brody,The drugstore's closed? What the hell time is it?
hendricks,"Nine-thirty, ten maybe."
brody,"Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?"
brody," Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone."
hendricks,Right.
ellen, Thank you. I'll tell him.
brody,For me?
ellen," Sort of -- Matthew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring."
brody,Damn.
mike,Is Hooper coming to dinner?
brody,Not till next year.
brody,"Oh, hi -- How was dinner?"
ellen,"Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair. Where were you?"
brody, Santos' place.
brody,Oww!
ellen,Careful. What's wrong?
brody,Nothing.
ellen,"Nothing, huh?"
brody,That's what I said. Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
ellen,Use the little brush there. Why were you at Santos'?
brody,Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
ellen,Oh. Want to talk about it?
brody,No.
ellen,Terrific.
brody,Michael.
mike,Yeah?
brody,You want to come here a minute?
sean,Hi Dad.
brody,Hiya yourself.
mike,What is it?
brody,I got something for you to do tomorrow.
mike,I kind of had plans...
brody,Sailing?  Forget it. You're beached. Grounded. No more boats.
mike,"Hey, come on..."
brody,"No backtalk! I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there. You can work until school starts."
ellen,All summer?
brody,"He wanted a job, he's got one. I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night."
ellen,Not so loud!
brody,I know what you're going to say.
ellen,Do you?
brody," In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies. Call the cops. What are we, immune?"
ellen,"It was bad, wasn't it."
brody,The goddamn smell is always the same. 
ellen,Are you going to be able to sleep?
brody,"Yeah. I think so.  Mike! Keep it down, for chrissake!"
peterson,"This is the town beach; the development naturally has its own private access, but I wanted you to see the concession area. Look at that sand -- like sugar!"
ellen,"During the summer, the sun sets right there...  Over the water. Beautiful."
vaughn, I'll say hello for you.
nichols,Hello -- selling some more of the good life?
ellen,"A piece here, a piece there, it all adds up."
nichols,Your husband's been here all morning. What's he doing?
ellen, His job.
vaughn,Your dad got you working?
mike,Yeah.
sean,I'm helping.
vaughn,You know where your dad is?
mike,Up there.
vaughn,"Oh, for Christ's sake."
peterson,"And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them."
vaughn,"Len, can I see you a minute?"
peterson,I think we got a couple of live ones.
vaughn,Brody's riding his tower.
peterson," Oh, shit."
jackie,This is fun! Can we go faster?
larry, Trim.
jackie,Yay!
larry,That's my dad!
vaughn, Wave to my son.
peterson, How the hell do we get him down from there?
vaughn,Maybe nobody will notice. Let's get them back in the bus.
peterson,"He's, ah, watching. A lookout."
renee, It's a shark tower. I saw one in Florida. He's looking for sharks.
vaughn,It's an observation platform. That's our Chief of Police. He's just checking it.
peterson,"Normally, it's used for, ah, bird watching. Nature observation. Weather measurements, that sort of thing.  Ellen, we're running late!"
ellen,"Okay. Folks, if we could get back on, we'll show you the country club, and stop for lunch..."
peterson,"The country club has an 18-hole course, putting greens, and twelve tennis courts..."
brody, Out of the water! Everyone out of the water!
brody,Get out of the water! Tell everyone to get out! Now! Out of the water!
vaughn," Oh, my God..."
peterson,What the hell is he doing?
nichols,"Oh, no!"
brody,Out of the water! Now! Everyone!
ellen, Martin! No!
brody,No! Don't go in! Stay out! Stay clear!
lifeguard,It's bluefish! It's a school of bluefish! Chief! It's bluefish!
a swimmer,What's going on?
another swimmer,Fish! Anyone got a net?
brody,Sorry. I'm sorry. False alarm...
brody,"Okay, it's all over, go on, it's over. No trouble..."
ellen,It's okay. It's over...
brody,"It's all right, everything's all right..."
vaughn,Brody's a good man.
kaiser,Nobody says he isn't.
peterson,"You should've been out there. You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac. There were shots fired!"
vaughn,He thought he had a good reason.
peterson,That's what I'm saying!
vaughn,How many people were there?
peterson," Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else."
vaughn,So? So?
peterson,"So it can't be done like that. The man's a menace, plain and simple."
vaughn,"Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over. We have to deal with the consequences."
sansom,That's what we're here to do.
vaughn,"All right. Let's go into my office, where we can have a little privacy."
vaughn,"I believe we have a quorum, and informally, I suggest we call this meeting an executive session and dispense with minutes..."
brody,"Polly, no calls, please...  Hello... Phil? Fogarty? What pictures... I'll be right down..."
phil,"I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped. I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days. Believe me, it's a pleasure..."
brody,You said something about a camera.
phil,"Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in-law, in Montauk, he works at a hi-fi store, and they sell cameras, so he..."
brody, Did you get any pictures?
phil,"Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny thing. You can't tell much from the negatives, I was going to blow 'em up. Here's a test I did..."
phil,"Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4. Look at the diffusion, though..."
brody,What else you got?
phil,Let's see -- you got a minute?
brody,"Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around."
phil,"Okay, okay -- stand over there..."
peterson, Speak of the devil.
brody,Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you. Proof!
vaughn,"Martin, this is kind of an official meeting"
brody,Perfect. Look at this ---
vaughn,Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
brody, What?
peterson,Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence?
brody,Temporarily? Uh... sure... The question's out of left field. Why are they asking?
nichols,"So Jeff could handle things? He knows the routine, he has the authority?"
brody,Yeah. Why?
peterson,It came up during the meeting.
brody,"Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty. It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along."
kaiser,Seaweed?
nichols,"It's underwater, isn't it? That's why it's so dark."
sansom,I don't know -- what is it?
brody,"It's a shark! A Great White! Jesus, it's right there!"
brody,"What are you all, blind? It's a shark. Look -- teeth, jaw, gills."
peterson,Is that what it is?
brody,You're damn right that's what it is.
nichols,"I'm sorry, I just don't see it."
vaughn,"Martin, it could be anything."
brody," What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls? Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand? I've seen this sonofabitch before!"
peterson,What have you seen before? This is nothing. Seaweed. Mud. Something in the lens.
brody,My ass!
vaughn,"Be reasonable, please..."
peterson," Forget it, he won't listen."
brody,There is nothing to discuss.
peterson," You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody decides to sue us? That could ruin us."
brody,Is that what it is? Dollars? Money? I'll pay for it. Take it out of my salary.
peterson,You don't make enough.
brody,"Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way."
peterson,What's that supposed to mean?
brody,"It means I don't like all that grab- ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again. Ever!"
vaughn,"Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?"
brody,"Go ahead, whatever it's worth."
peterson,I won't mention his personal attack on me.
nichols,I've never seen him like this.
peterson,"And Hendricks is qualified, you heard that from his own mouth."
kaiser,We made a motion and it was already seconded.
vaughn," Very well then. It is moved and seconded that Martin Brody be relieved of his duties as Chief of Police, his contract with the township be terminated, and that Jeff Hendricks be appointed Acting Chief in the interim. Those in favor?"
peterson,"Anyone opposed, or is it unanimous?"
vaughn,"I'm sorry, but I respect his convictions. The motion is carried."
vaughn,Martin? Could you come in please?
ellen,"Hi. I closed a sale today, without Len. That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through."
brody,That's great.
ellen,Sean's asleep.
brody,That's great too. Gorgeous.
brody,You look about 22 years old sitting there. Like you were doing homework...
ellen, What's wrong?
brody,"Ooohh, nothing. I just got fired, that's all."
ellen,What?
brody,What'd I say?
ellen,That you were fired.
brody,Then that's what I meant. Fired. Canned. Out on my fanny. The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police. Just like that.
ellen,Because of today? The beach?
brody," No sweat. A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat... we're surrounded by water here, you realize that? Me, surrounded by water... Ridiculous."
ellen,Stop that! We're not going any place. You love it here. Tell me what the hell happened!
brody,"Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it. Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture... He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me..."
ellen," Honey, this is nothing... I don't know what it is. What did they..."
brody," ...Everybody wants the job. No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks. Fine. He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me. Call me in New York... tell him to kiss my ass..."
ellen," They have no right to treat you like that. You've given them everything. For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island..."
brody,Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man. I'm responsible. I know what I saw...
ellen,I know you did...
brody,"I try. Goddamnit, I tried... Now, I'm tired... I can't keep fighting it... I'm too tired... I'm... I'm..."
ellen,You're drunk is what you are...
ellen,Take it easy... Easy...
sean,Is dad home? I heard something...
ellen,Shhhh. Go back upstairs. Daddy's sleeping.
sean,What's this?
ellen,"Nothing, sweetheart. Seaweed."
doug, That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
timmy,"Gaff rigged? Why not a staysail schooner? Go anywhere. Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner."
bob,"Hey, Mike -- I saw your dad over at the town hall."
mike,I know.
doug, Did he really freak out at the beach?
mike,I don't know.
andy,"Hey, it's all bullshit. Anyone want to play pong for money?"
larry,How was the show?
ed,Yech.
tina,It was okay.
patrick,I'd rather go the lighthouse.
lucy,Who wouldn't.
polo,Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
brooke,Now? At night?
polo,"Nah. Tomorrow. Early, spend the day. My folks left two cases of beer in the garage."
patrick,Is it still there?
polo,Nope. Got it in my boat.
lucy,All-right.
jackie,Let's go for it.
tina,"Mike, you going?"
mike,Why shouldn't I?
larry,I thought you might still be painting the restrooms at the beach.
brooke,Anyone want a coke or anything?
jackie,I'd like to go out to the lighthouse with you.
mike,I'm not sure I can.
jackie,"It'll be fun, come on!"
mike,Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach...
jackie,"No way. Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so."
mike,That's not it. My dad told me not to go.
jackie,You do everything your parents tell you?
mike,No.
jackie,"Good. I'll be on the dock at eight.  Eight o'clock, everybody!"
jackie, Who's bringing the wine? And who's got a quarter for the box?
brooke,She just likes to tease. I think she really likes you.
mike,Great.
sean, You're going out.
mike,Yeah.
sean,You're going sailing.
mike,Maybe.
sean,Take me.
mike,No.
sean, I want to go with you!
mike,Quiet!  Shhh!
sean, Michael...
mike,"Okay, okay. Close your door."
brody,"Good morning, America..."
ellen,What're you going to do today?
brody,"Turn in the car. Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss."
ellen,I'll give notice.
brody,Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
brody,Mike left early. Couldn't wait to make out. Must be a morning man.
ellen,"Sean's not up yet. You know what he likes, just some Fruit Loops and milk. No candy."
brody,"The sink upstairs is busted. Try some Drano, or a plunger, maybe. Or call your brother, the plumber, what's his name..."
brody,Frankie. Okay. Ask him if he needs an apprentice.
andy,"If you're beached, why are we doing this? For practice?"
mike,Yeah.
andy,Then why are we futzing around the dock? We can make a few bucks working at the beach.
mike,"Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home."
sean,"I'm not in the way. Andy, am I in the way?"
andy,You're always in the way.
marge,This guy giving you any trouble?
sean,Put me down!
andy,Put him down in the water.
marge, You want to go out in my boat?
sean,Yeah.
mike,Would you take him?
marge,Sure.
andy,You've just made someone very happy.
brooke,Mike! Are you going out?
mike,Maybe.
jackie,I thought you were grounded.
mike,I can go out if I want to.
andy,You can?
jackie,You going to the lighthouse?
mike,Why not?
andy,I could give you a dozen good reasons.
mike, Shut up.
andy,"Okay, okay, don't say I didn't remind you."
jackie,Is there room on your boat for all of us?
andy,"Well, we're pretty crowded, and I don't know when we're leaving..."
timmy,I've got room.
brooke,Great.  That's okay -- I'll go with Timmy.
timmy,You will?
brooke,Sure.
timmy,Fan-tas-tic!
jackie,I'm ready.
jackie,"Come on, you guys."
andy,"Well, I don't know..."
jackie,Please come with us?
jackie,For me...?
andy,What the hell. For you...
bob,I thought you said she was going with us?
larry,"Let's just go sailing, okay?"
bob, Want to talk about it?
larry,Want to swim home?
andrews,Hey! Nicholas! You're supposed to be in class!
andy,Today I'm staying topside. You dive for me!
andrews,I'm going for lobster.
jackie,Great! Find one for me.
andy,"With butter, if they got any..."
andrews,"So long, turkies."
andrews,"Sparky will take you down today. If everyone's got a buddy, we'll drop."
crosby, Let's get some dinner.
sparky,"Get us in! For Christ's sake, get us in!"
tina,"You want to tack, or just leave her pointed up like this?"
ed, Just like this.
tina,What about sailing?
ed,The tide's running. It'll take us to the light.
tina,It'll take us to Budapest if you're not careful.
ed,First things first.
tina,What about the others?
ed,They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
tina,What're we going to do in the mean time?
ed,I dunno. We'll think of something.
ed,"But first, a little juice..."
tina,And second?
ed, Mmmmmm.
tina, Wait a minute. Promise me something.
ed,Anything. Anything.
tina,"That you'll put down a blanket. I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them."
ed,You got it.
lucy,Faster! Faster!
patrick,Coming about...
polo, Great day! I think the wind's going to change...
marge,Coming up.
sean,Slowpoke! Slowpoke! Marge is faster!
doug,"I'm getting new sails, then watch out. Just a question of modifying the rigging!"
jackie,Wheee! Faster!
andy,How fast is enough?
jackie,I want to go faster!
mike,Hang on...
bob,You coming up on him?
larry,You bet. Hang on...
larry,Coming up! Give way!
andy,Like hell! We're on the starboard tack!
jackie,Don't let him pass. Faster!
jackie,My hair's getting wet!
andy,So's mine.
jackie,When do we get to the lighthouse?
andy,"Soon, dark eyes, soon."
mike,The tide's turning.
andy,"We're going to be fighting the current.  Wind's backing around a few points, too."
jackie,I can't wait to get there.
andy,But of course.
ellen,Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
brody,Just one minute...
brody,What the hell happened?
sparky,Embolism. Air bubbles in his blood. Came up too damn fast. Held his goddamn breath!
hendricks,Easy...
crosby,He panicked! Something scared him!
attendant,It's okay. We're taking care of him.
brody,How'd this happen?
sparky,"Bite reflex, like a spasm."
brody,When?
hendricks,"Right after, the Kids went out?"
ellen,What Kids? Who went out?
hendricks,"All of them. Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang."
ellen,Mike? Our Mike?
hendricks,Yep. Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.
brody,How long ago?
hendricks,"About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight..."
ellen,What're you doing?
brody,Going out.
hendricks,"Uh, Chief -- look. You're not Chief any more."
hendricks,I can't let you take her out.
brody,You can't stop me.
hendricks,"Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go. Neither of you can go."
ellen,I'm going.
brody,Mike's out there.
hendricks,But I signed for the boat. You're not authorized any more.
brody,Untie that rope.
hendricks,Please. It's my job.
ellen,I'll do it.
hendricks,"Mrs. Brody, please..."
hendricks,You're too close. Back off.
brody,"Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there."
hendricks,Let me. Please.
ellen,"Hurry, please."
hendricks,"What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right? Which way are we going?"
brody,Find the Kids. The lighthouse -- you said something about the lighthouse. Get us there.
brody,"Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol, over."
brody,Affirmative. Can you get your chopper airborne?
patrol voice,"10-4, in a few minutes. He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel."
brody,"Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse. Right now."
patrol voice,What for?
brody,There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way. Turn them back to port.
patrol voice,That's it?
brody,"That's it. Just do it, all right?"
patrol voice,"10-4, soon as I can raise him."
brody,"If they're not at the light, look for them. I don't want them out there. Get them back to port!"
patrol voice," Affirmative, affirmative. Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port. I heard you. Patrol out."
donnie,Hungry?
denise,Starving. Let's go eat now.
donnie, We're going in to eat!
larry,Hey! Brody! Want to race?
mike, Sure.
larry,How about a side bet to make it interesting?
jackie,That's fun! Let's race for something!
mike,Name it.
larry,Loser sails home alone.
andy, You're betting what you already got.
mike,I don't care.
jackie,I love it.
andy,Sure you do -- you win either way.
jackie, I'm supposed to.
larry,It's a bet. Once around the marker buoy?
mike,That's the pin -- the buoy.
andy, Turkeys! Eat wind!
mike,Yee-hah!
doug,Hey! Wait for the H.M.S. Invincible!
brooke,Can't -- we're watching a race!
doug,Since when? Who's racing?
timmy,Larry and Mike!
lucy,Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
patrick,"If we beat them, they can both go home stag! Single-O! Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!"
lucy,What about me?
patrick,Uh. Well. Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in...
lucy," Your ass I will. Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch."
pilot, Air Patrol to Base. I have visual contact on the Kids. Going down to use the loud hailer...
andy, Your dad must be really pissed.
mike,We better go back in.
andy,It's not going to be easy.
jackie,What's wrong?
mike,"We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide."
andy,Putz -- that won't be for hours.
mike,I was counting on hours.
mike,"We're trying, we're trying."
lucy,Heading back?
patrick,Might as well.
polo,They're turning around.
lucy,"Coming about, then."
sean,Are we going back?
marge,"Going to try. Lighthouse, everybody..."
doug,Make way for the Carrier Enterprise!
doug,Make that the Titanic.
pilot,Patrol One to Base. Looks like they're turning back.
control,"All right, Patrol. Go back to work. You've wasted enough time."
ellen,Michael?
brody,It's not his boat.
ellen,Be careful...
hendricks,Anything?
brody, Hold on...
brody,Tina!
tina, N-o-o-o-o-o-o...
brody,"It's okay, it's okay. What's the matter? Tina? Honey? Hey --"
tina,No! It's still there!
brody,What is it? What's there?
tina,It's still there!
brody, I need a hand here...
ellen,"Tina, baby... what is it?"
tina,Sh... Sh... Shark...
brody,I knew it. I goddamn well told them.
brody,Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol.
brody,Skip that. What about those kids out sailing?
brody,He left them?
brody,Get him the hell back there! We got possible fatalities! Brody out...
brody,I'm going out there.
hendricks,Hey -- you can't do that.
ellen,What is it? What's the matter?
brody,Mike's out there.
brody, Get her in. Get them both in.
ellen,"Martin, please!"
hendricks,"Chief, be sensible..."
brody,Where are they?
hendricks,"About 10 degrees off your starboard bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast..."
brody,Never mind that shit. Just point.
hendricks, See where Cable Junction is? Look to the left. The lighthouse. That's it.
brody,Got it.
ellen,Come back! Martin!
ellen,My purse is on that boat.
doug,Mr. Christian! Mr. Christian! Pump up this boat! And shave that silly moustache!
doug,"England expects every man to do his duty... You may fire when ready, Gridley... Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead..."
doug,"Oh, shit."
andy,Someone pop your balloon?
doug,"No problem, no problem."
jackie,Want a lifesaver?
marge,How about a skyhook?
doug,"You sail your boat, I'll sail mine."
mike,"Hey, Fetterman -- You got company."
doug,Company? The place is a mess...
doug,Whoops.
mike,Doug's down!
andy,Doug! This way!
patrick,What was that about?
marge,You okay?
lucy,What was that?
larry,So much for the rubber duck.
doug,A shark ate my boat.
bob,Come on.
doug,"I'm telling you, a goddamn shark ate my goddamn boat!"
andy,"If he liked your boat, I got some sneakers he'll love."
andy,Raft up! Raft 'em up!
larry,Tie off to your strongest point.
patrick,Anyone need an extra line?
timmy,Mike's bleeding!
andy,Can you sail?
polo, Yeah! We'll take him in!
brody," Amity Launch to Patrol Air Unit One. Harbor Air, where are you?"
brody,It's me. Any fix on those Kids?
brody,"For Christ's sake, get going! I'm all alone out here!"
brody,Where the hell is Francis Shoal?
brody,I'm all alone out here.
runby,"The Amity Police Boat, under full power, surging through the heavy swell, Brody very much alone at the helm."
brody,Shit.
larry,Anyone know what time it is?
marge,Damn!
jackie,What's wrong?
brooke,Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
doug,Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
andy,What'd you do? Memorize the tide tables?
doug,"I can't help it, it sticks in my mind."
brooke, Anyone want to play charades?
patrick,"As long as we're drifting, might as well go with the flow."
andy,Not funny.
patrick,Three knot current?
lucy,At least. And an offshore wind.
sean,What's after Cable Junction?
bob,The Atlantic. Then Ireland.
jackie,Can't we stop?
brooke,They're probably looking for us.
doug,What about the fish?
larry,Maybe it's gone.
doug,They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
brooke,So all we have to do is land at Cable Junction and wait.
patrick,First we got to get there.
larry,How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
bob,Anyone got another set of sails?
sean,Is that big thing still out there?
marge,Shhhh.
larry,Hey!
bob, Over here!
andy,Don't everyone jump around!
pilot,"Air One to Base. I have a positive location on that sailing party. Disabled and adrift...  ...about 3/4 miles west of Cable Junction, wind and current carrying them just about due east. I count ten juveniles."
pilot,Everyone okay? Any injuries?
andy,Can you put us on Cable Junction?
pilot,I got no room for passengers.
andy,How about a tow? Can you rig that?
larry,"As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in. My dad's the mayor..."
andy, There's a shark...
jackie,You have to take us off! You have to! Why don't you take us!
doug," It's an observation spotter, he doesn't have the room..."
pilot,"Listen. I'm going to give you an assist to get you on Cable Junction. Then I'll call in, and get the Coast Guard to send a cutter. Hang on to something."
larry,Look out!
jackie, No-o-o-o!
sean,Help!
andy,Don't struggle!
marge,Sean!
patrick,Sean! Sean!
andy,Don't move!
sean,Andy! Please help! Help!
brody,"Harbor Air, this is Brody. Air One, come in."
brody,"Harbor Air, do you read? Over?"
patrol voice,Brody? This is Patrol Base.
brody,Where the hell is Air One?
patrol voice,That's what I'd like to know. Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
brody,Did he raise the Kids?
patrol voice,Last transmission said ten juveniles.
brody,Yeah? Then what?
patrol voice,"Then nothing. If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself."
brody,Did you say Cable Junction?
patrol voice,That's what he said.
brody,When?
patrol voice,1530 hours. Might still be there. Base out.
larry,Sean! Catch the rope!
bob,The rope! The rope!
patrick,He's got to help or it won't work.
lucy,"Sean, baby, please..."
jackie,It killed her. It ate her.
brooke,Shh. Shhh...
doug,"It's okay, it's okay..."
andy,"Sean! Listen! Listen to me, Sean."
andy,"Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?"
lucy,"Listen to Andy, Sean."
andy,"We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?"
andy, Keep an eye out for that fish.
larry,Throw it.
andy,Sean! Catch it!
lucy,Larry!
bob,Cable Junction's ahead!
lucy,Can we make it?
bob,I don't know.
larry, You okay?
brooke, Jackie? Baby?
patrick,Can someone help me rig a jury rudder? We might steer this...
doug,"By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out. More, with this wind."
larry,Shut up.
doug,I can't stop thinking!
lucy," God, please help us, Merciful Father, in Christ's name, we beg you, help us, please, Dear God, save us, help us, please, God, help..."
brody,Thank Christ.
polo,Over here! Yo!
brody,I'm coming alongside!
brody,Mike? Is that you?
mike,Pop. I'm sorry.
brody,It's okay. What happened?
polo,A shark hit us out there.
timmy,Mike got knocked over.
mike,"I passed out, but I'm okay."
brody,At least you're safe. What about the others?
brody,"Jesus, don't freeze on me. What about the others?"
mike, Sean's still out there.
brody,What?
mike,"He wanted to come. It was okay, wasn't it? It was okay before..."
polo,The others are ratted together. Drifting.
brody,Which way?
timmy,With the current. Towards Cable Junction.
mike,"Dad, I'm sorry..."
brody,Stay here. Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
brody,Stay at the lighthouse!
andy,Bring her to port a little. That's it -- steady.
doug,I think we're changing course a little.
brooke,Can we land on it?
lucy,If we can get to it.
jackie,We're going to die.
brooke," It's all right, we're okay."
andy,More to port.
bob,It's all the way over.
andy,Shit.
sean,Are we going to go on the island?
brooke,"You bet, kiddo."
andy, I don't know.
larry,"What the hell, we're steering for it."
doug,The wind drift is lateral.
larry,What's that mean?
doug,"Sideways -- For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way..."
lucy,But we had it! We were headed right for it!
andy,"Shit. Shit, shit, shit!"
jackie,We're going to miss it!
andy,Don't!
doug,Stop paddling!
lucy,But the island!
andy,The Shark.
brooke,What is it?
andy,We're hung up on something.
doug,Maybe the bottom.
jackie, It's that thing. It's going to kill us now... We're going to die!
larry,Shut up! Just shut Up!
brooke,Leave her alone!
bob,"Lighten up, man..."
larry,It's bad enough without her freaking out.
patrick,"She's hysterical, goddamn it!"
lucy,Don't yell at her!
lucy,Wait a minute! Listen! Listen!
bob,Over there! Coming this way!
sean,It's Dad!
andy,"Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!"
doug,Back down!
larry,We're hung up here. Snagged.
bob,Can you get us a line?
doug,We got it!
patrick,"Go ahead, slow."
lucy,Be careful.
andy,Whoa!
doug,Come around again!
andy,"Hang on, hang on -- we got it. You're on!"
sean,Dad! Help!
brody,Hang on!
sean,Dad! Dad!
brody,"I'm okay, baby, I'm here. It's okay..."
brody,Can you get a line to me?
andy,Get the cable in! Pull!
brody,Son of a bitch is stuck!
doug,It's killing us!
jackie,I don't want to die! Mommy!
brody,"Come on, you bastard, come on, pull. Pull!"
brody,Sean! Hang on!
andy,Get on the rocks!
doug,Swim for it!
patrick,Lucy! Look out!
lucy,I'm bleeding!
bob,Help!
brody,Hang on! Just hang on!
brody,I'm coming!
brody,Andy! Use the lights! The lights!
andy,Where are you? Chief!
brody,You bastard!
brody,"Come here, you son-of-a-bitch!"
brody,Over here! You bastard! Over here
brody,Come and get me! Come and get me!
brody,Sean?
sean,Dad?
sean,They made me go with them.
brody,Sure they did...
