Speaker,Dialogue
anatoly,"Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us."
kasimov," I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun."
kasimov,"I don't even know how I got here. I swear, Anatoly, I never touched her!  I didn't lay a finger on her."
anatoly,Kasimov.  Don't flounder.
kasimov,"You're right, of course."
ethan,IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
phelps, What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
phelps," Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?"
ethan,Why not?
ethan,He won't be back in a hurry?
ethan,Always.
ethan,"In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll."
ethan,"Stairway, youre wrapped, go to transport."
hannah,En route.
jack,Hey.
phelps,"Jack, what are you doing?!"
jack,Im not doing anything!  .
phelps,I dont have it -- I dont have control!
jack,Uh -- then I have a problem.
ethan,Cut the power.  Cut the power Jack.  Do you hear me.
ethan,Jack.  Jack.
phelps,Man down.  Stay where you are.  Im on my way.
phelps,En route.
sarah,The package is in the open.
ethan,Jim.  Jim.  Hes in the open.
ethan,Can you lose him?
sarah,Ethan.  Hes out of pocket.
ethan, Jim we cant.
ethan,"Negative, Golitsyns on the move."
ethan,"Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Im coming to you."
sarah,"Jim gave an abort, we should walk away."
ethan,"No, were going to recover the disk, understand?!  Now move!"
ethan,About two hundred yards from the bridge.
ethan,JIM!
ethan,CLAIRE!
ethan,Central Europe.  Unsecured.
ethan,Bravo Echo one one.
ethan,Go secure.
ethan,Theyre dead.
ethan,"My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- dont know"
ethan,They knew we were coming.  Golitsyns dead too.  The disk is gone.
ethan,Do you read me?  The list is in the open!
ethan,I dont think so.
ethan,Yes.
ethan,Youre in Prague?
ethan,No sir.
kittridge,"Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?"
ethan,"Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. Why?"
ethan,Job.  Job 3:14.  March fourteen.  Job 31 March.
phelps,"Ethan, what are you doing?"
ethan,Take off your coat.
ethan,"I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list."
ethan,"Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me."
ethan,I'm going to answer it.
matthias,Would you remove your hat please?
ethan,I thought I was going to see Max.
max,Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
max,On what?
max,It's quite out of the question.
max,And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
ethan,I'm NOC.  Was.  Now disavowed.
ethan,That's the question I want to ask Job.
ethan,Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
matthias,Fifty-seven. Fifty-nine.
max,I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
ethan,How will you make sure Job will be there?
max,How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
ethan,"I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job."
ethan,"We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local."
ethan,Simple game.  Four players.  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
ethan,This doesn't sound like the Luther Stickell I've heard of.  What'd they used to call you?  The Net Ranger?  Phineas Phreak?  The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.
ethan,May take a little time. That's not what Claire tells me about you.
ethan,I just need you to be safe.
claire,What about you?
ethan,What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.
kittridge,"Too short sighted.  This guy's proactive, he initiates.  The question is what does he want now and where does he need to get it and Barnes what the hell is that noise?!"
barnes,That's S.O.P..
ethan,Do you want to blow the fire through the whole building?
ethan,Let's move!
cia analyst,William Donloe.
ethan,Time up.
krieger,That's not it.  That's not the list.
ethan,Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles was an especially nice touch.
phelps,"..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases."
ethan,- and picked us up in the States -
ethan,"Why, Jim?  Why?"
phelps,"..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - without your permission.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How dare he?  You realize its over, youre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, well go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!"
ethan,"We dont have to, Jim.  Hell come after us."
phelps,Whats going to make him do that?
ethan,What he didnt get in Prague.  The NOC list.
phelps,"Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you."
ethan,"A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris."
phelps,Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
ethan,"If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Ill have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris."
ethan,Jim...?
phelps,"I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Im dead and gone.  God knows what shes had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I.."
phelps,"- no.  She cant know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Theres too much at stake, Ethan."
ethan,Youre probably right.
phelps,I usually am.
ethan,"Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Ill call you from Paris."
phelps,You got it.
ethan,And get a doctor.
phelps,Good luck.
claire,What happened?
ethan, I sent the message to Max.  Were on for tomorrow.
claire,Okay...
claire,Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
kittridge, How long to the London Terminus?
agent,"Twenty, twenty-five minutes."
kittridge,Youve got ten.  Move!
max,How long until we reach the Chunnel?
matthias,Twenty minutes.
matthias,Yes...  Its him.
max, This wasnt what we discussed.
max," Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnt prelude a meeting in private."
max,"The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver"
max,I wouldnt worry about him.  Once youve got the money -- hell find you.
barnes,Only four more cars.
kittridge,And if we dont find him - well search the whole train again.
barnes,Whats Hunt doing on the TGV?
kittridge,High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
barnes,But why tell us?
kittridge,"Hes putting on a show, Barnes."
barnes,What kind of show.
kittridge,I dont know.  It didnt say on the tickets.
claire,Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
ethan,Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
claire,Two cars.  Where are you?
ethan,You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
max, Hes in the baggage car.
max,Whats the problem.
matthias,Connection denied.
max,Try it again.
matthias,Its not working.
max,Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
matthias,I always check the batteries.
max,Run it through from the top.
barnes,"Nothing but civilians, Gene."
kittridge,This is bullshit - we dont even know what Max looks like.
barnes,"Maybe we dont have to know what he looks like.  If hes got that list, hes going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops."
kittridge,Good idea.
waiter,"Excuse me, Sir, your telephone..."
matthias,Its working.
max,Phew!  Weve got five minutes...
kittridge,Get this door open.
kittridge,"Hello, Luther.  Wheres Hunt?"
luther,"Mr. Kittridge, the NOC list is being modemed off the train."
kittridge,Where?
claire,Ethans right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
ethan,Of course - Im sorry to hear you say that Claire.
claire,Ethan?
phelps,"Yes.  Ethan Hunt, darling.  Remember him?"
claire,You knew about Jim?
phelps,"Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?"
ethan,Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
phelps,"They stamped it, didnt they?  Those damn Gideons."
phelps,Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisll have to be quicker than Id like. Certainly quicker than youd like.
claire,"Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why.."
phelps,"Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youve asked the question and you are the answer."
ethan,I knew about Jim.
phelps,"But, he didnt know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  ""Thou shall not covet thy Neighbours wife"", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worlds lovers, hes tortured by the same, one pathetic question - ""does she feel the same way I do?"""
phelps,Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
claire,Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
ethan,Youve earned it.
phelps,Count it.
ethan,"Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?"
phelps,Keep counting Claire.
claire,It was me.  I did it.
phelps,Satisfied?
claire,All ten million.
phelps,Fold it.  Fold it tight.
ethan,Arent you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.
phelps,Dont flatter yourself - six was for Eastern Europe.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
phelps,Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
ethan,Youre wrong about one thing.  Im not the only one whos seen you alive.
kittridge,"Good morning, Mr Phelps."
phelps,You son of a bitch.
claire,Dont Jim.
phelps,"Now we dont have to eliminate him?  You like that, dont you Claire?  Dont you?"
claire,Yes.
ethan,"Jim, its over."
phelps,"Ethan - Ive always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you."
ethan,Claire...Hey...
claire,This stuff is so sticky.
ethan,Claire.
claire,"Its all right, Ethan..youll bring me back...wont you..."
max,Damn!
luther,I think this is what you're looking for.
ethan,About what?
luther, Cheers.
ethan,"Here's to  you, Luther.   To being off the disavowed list."
ethan,"You're more than that, Luther.  They were mistaken about you and they're trying to show you they know it.  They want you back in."
luther,Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They still can't figure out how we did it.
ethan,"No, thank you."
