Speaker,Dialogue
deadpool,Kinda lonesome back here.
cabbie,Dopinder.
deadpool, Pool. Deadpool.
dopinder,"Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?"
deadpool,"It's like Christmas Day, Dopinder. Been waiting one thousand eight hundred twenty- two days, three hours...  ...and thirty-six minutes for this shit."
dopinder,"Smells good, no?"
deadpool,Not the Daffodil Daydream.      The girl.
dopinder,Ah yes. Gita. She is quite lovely. She was supposed to make me a very agreeable wife. Mom and Dad chose her rather excellently. But Gita's heart has been stolen by my cousin Bandhu. Bandhu is as dishonorable as he is attractive.
deadpool,"Dopinder, I'm starting to think I'm in this cab for a reason."
dopinder,Because you hailed it?
deadpool,"No, my slender brown friend... to give you one crucial piece of advice: Love... is a beautiful thing. When it finds you, the whole world smells like Daffodil Daydream."
dopinder,And how does Ms. Mama June taste?
deadpool,"Like two hobos making love under a drizzle of Limburger- I could go all day like this. Point is, bad."
dopinder,Shall we turn back?
deadpool,No time. Not today.  Right here!
deadpool,Oooo. I never carry a wallet when I'm working. Ruins the lines of my suit. How 'bout a crisp high five?
dopinder,Be sure to... ask for me again?
deadpool,"I owe you one. Merry Christmas, Dopinder."
dopinder,"And a convivial... Tuesday in April to you, Pool... Guy."
guard,You're someone else's problem now.
prisoner,Yes.   I.   Am.
deadpool,Can I get some fries with that shake- shake boobie? If looks could kill you would be an uzi.
ajax, They won't disappoint.
warlord,They'd better not.    And next month's shipment?
ajax,There won't be one. Demand is high. You aren't the only one with a war to win.
warlord, That won't do.
ajax,"There's been a small... disruption in our supply chain. We'll deliver in full the following month. Say, ten percent off for the inconvenience?"
warlord, Fucking mutant.
deadpool,"On your mark, get set, go, let me go, let me shoop..."
deadpool,Hola! Me llamo Piscina De La Muerte!  Any of you seen Green Lantern? Me neither.
reporter,The assailant appears to be wearing a...
colossus,I've given Deadpool every chance to join us. And what is my reward? More immaturity and criminality! When will he finally grow up and see benefits of becoming X-Man?
ntw,Like... The house that blows up every few years? The fashion-forward jump-suits? I need to get myself kicked out of X- School.
colossus,But I thought you were at top of class.
ntw,Was that sarcasm?    Awesome.
colossus,"You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast is most important meal of day.  Here. Protein bar, good for bones. Deadpool may try to break yours."
deadpool,"Wait, wait..."
deadpool,Someone's not counting.    Cinco.
merchant,Will it help if I slow down?         I didn't. Order. The pizza.
jeremy,This 7348 Red Ledge Drive?  And you're... Mr. Merchant?
merchant,The Mr. Merchant who didn't.         Order. The. Fucking. Pie.
jeremy,Then who placed the call?
merchant,The fuck are you? And what are you doing in my crib?!
wade, Burnt crust?
jeremy,God I hope not.  Words cannot express-
wade,"Relax, son, that's hows I likes it!      Once you go black, you never go back! "
merchant," This is about the poker game, right? I told Howie... Listen, take whatever you want!"
wade,Thanks!
jeremy, Uh. Sir? Before you do anything to him. Could I have a big tip?
wade," Jeremy, is it?"
jeremy,Yeah.
wade,Wade Wilson.  I'm here for you.
merchant,Dodged a big time bullet on that o-
wade, And the Axe body spray.
jeremy, That's unfortunately me.
wade,"PS, I'm keeping your wallet.         Ya did kinda give it to me..."
merchant,Can I at least have my Sam's Club card baaa-
wade,I will shoot your fucking cat.
merchant,I don't have a cat!
wade,"Then whose kitty-litter did I just shit in?  Anyhoo, you by chance know a Meghan Orlovsky? Getting that right? Orlovsky? Orloskvy? Do you?"
jeremy,B-but I'm-
wade," A stalker. Threats hurt, Jer. Though not nearly as bad as serrated steel."
jeremy,Y-yeah.
wade,Then we're done.
jeremy,W-we are?
wade,"Soft spot, remember? But even look in her general direction again? You'll learn in the worst of ways.  That came out wrong. Or did it?"
girls, You give me nice dreams.     You make me wanna scream...
wade, What'd he do to you?
wade," Good for him! Sorry, ladies. Me no dig cigs. And I may look mean. But if I give a guy a pavement facial? He earned it."
meghan,Hey.   Thanks. You're my hero.
wade,That I ain't.
wade,Boothe!
boothe," Heya, Wade!"
weasel,"Wade Wilson, Patron Saint of the Pitiful. What can I get you?"
wade,I'd love a blow-job.
weasel,We got that in common.
wade,"The drink, moose-knuckle.     But first..."
weasel,"Orlofsky. For a merc, you sure are warm- blooded. Bet you let the boy off easy- peasy, too."
wade, - meeting new and exciting people -
weasel,"And killing them. I've seen your Instagram. What was Special Forces doing in Jacksonville, anyway?"
wade,"Classified.  They have a wonderful TGIFridays. Those guys know their way around a Loaded Potato Skin. The point is, I'm trying to put those days in my rear-view."
weasel,"Kahlua, Bailey's, whip cream.        Fellatio in a glass."
buck,"So he's staring at my Glock in his mouth, like...  `I thought you guys had a code!' And I'm like, `Yeah, no kids. No women. Almost fooled by your tits. But the moustache?!"
wade,"Kelly, you mind taking this over to Buck? Tell him it's from Boothe.  Little foreplay."
weasel,Remind me what good comes of this?
wade,I don't take the shits.       I just disturb them.
wade, It's a dirty job... but someone's gotta take out the garbage.
weasel,Still kicking.
wade,Lemme guess. Ya got Boothe in Sister Margaret's dead pool.
weasel,Um.    See.    About that-
wade,You did not bet on me to die.  You bet on me to die.
weasel,"Wait, who did you pick?"
wade,"The Biebs. But I'm probably wrong. Nothing bad ever happens to teen stars who make 80 mil a year and think they're immune to the pitfalls of addiction and consequence. He'll be fine.  Drinks on me, soldiers of fortune!"
mercenaries,Hooah!
vanessa,"Whoa, whoa..."
wade,Tight.
vanessa,Vanessa.
wade,What's a nice place like you doing in a girl like this?
wade,"Buck, you'd best apologize, before-"
vanessa," Say the magic words, Fat Gandalf."
buck,I'm sorry! I have no filter between my brain and mouth. I'm working on it.
wade,"OK, he apologized... hakuna his tatas..."
vanessa, Hands off the merchandise.
wade,"Merchandise? So, what, you, uh, bump fuzzies for money?"
vanessa,Yup.
wade,Rough childhood?
vanessa,Rougher than yours.     Daddy left before I was born.
wade,Daddy left before I was conceived.
vanessa,Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin?
wade,I didn't know there was any other place to put one out.
vanessa,I was molested.
wade,Me too.     Uncle.
vanessa,Uncles.     They took turns.
wade,"I watched my own birthday party from the keyhole of a locked closet, which was also my-"
vanessa,Bedroom?    Lucky. I slept in a dishwasher box.
wade,"So you had a dishwasher. I didn't know sleep. It was pretty much 24-7 of ball gags, brownie mix, and fun-house mirrors."
vanessa,Who would do such a thing?
wade,Hopefully you. Later tonight.  And my Uncle Kevin.
vanessa,About forty-eight minutes of whatever you want...  And a low-fat dessert.
wade,Time to put balls... in holes.
vanessa,I get it. You love skeeball.          Apparently more than you love vagina.
wade,"Tough call. Just trying to get to know the real you... not the plunging- necklined, short-shorted, two-dimensional sex object peddled by Hollywood."
boy,Nice tits!
vanessa,"Thank you, son.  You know how to make a woman feel special."
wade,Prepare to lose tragically.
vanessa,"Bring it, big man."
wade,"The limited edition Voltron: Defender of the Universe ring, por favor."
teen,You're roughly three hundred thousand tickets short.  It's nickel-silver-plated.
wade, Then I guess the tire-grade rubber Voltron keychain.
vanessa,And the... pencil eraser.
teen, And you... you can... erase stuff... written in pencil.
wade,M'lady?
vanessa,"Unfortunately, my anus-loving friend, your forty-eight minutes are up."
wade,Arus. And you're more evil than evil King Zarkon himself.
vanessa, Three minutes.
wade, That's all I'll need!
wade,What do we do with the remaining two minutes thirty seven seconds?
vanessa,Cuddle?
wade, All year?
vanessa,Happy Valentine's Day...
wade,Happy Chinese New Year's...
vanessa, Year of the Dog.
wade,Happy Fourth of July!
vanessa,Happy Yom Kippur...  Happy Wednesday...
wade, Happy Halloween...
vanessa,Oo... ow...
wade, Happy Halloween...
vanessa,Happy Thanksgiving.  Happy Wednesday.
vanessa,"Y'know, red's your color. Brings out the bloodshot in your eyes. Christmas gift! Catch!"
wade,Holy fucking shit.
vanessa,Limited edition. I had to give the kid behind the counter a rub and tug. I'm kidding. I'm not kidding. I'm kidding. It was nearly five full months of Skeeball.
wade," Y'know, I've been doing some thinking..."
vanessa,Really.
wade,...about why we're so good together.
vanessa,Why's that?
wade,"Your crazy    matches my crazy. We're like two jigsaw    pieces... weird curvy edges... but fit us    together, you can see the picture on    top."
vanessa,"Hey, I've been meaning to ask you, only `cause you haven't gotten around to asking me-  Wade, will you-"
vanessa,Uhh... jinx?
wade,They say one month's salary.
vanessa,You mean-?
wade,I do.
vanessa,"That's my line. I love you, Wade Wilson."
wade,Thought you charged extra for that.
vanessa,I did.    At my old job.
wade,So that's a-?
vanessa,Easy.    I can take it back.
wade,What if I never let go?
vanessa,"Just rode a bitch's back, like Yoda on Luke?"
wade, `Star Wars' jokes?!
vanessa, `Empire.'
wade,It's like I made you in a computer.
wade,You're clowning.     You're not clowning?        I sense clowns.
doctor,People react to news of late-stage cancer differently.
vanessa," So what do we do? Surely there's something... we can... do. I mean, my uncle, he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, and there was this new experimental drug that-"
doctor,Take your time to process this.
deadpool,You know how many people I've killed to find you?
ajax,"Actually, I do."
deadpool,"So you're aware I've been waiting a long, long time for this. And now I'm finally gonna...  Then you know what's coming. I'm about to do to you what Sugar Ray did to the mid-nineties."
vanessa,Wham?
wade,Wham!  `Make it Big' was the album George and Andy earned their exclamation point.
vanessa,So I'm s'posed to just... smile and wave you out the door?
wade,Think of it as a spring cleaning. Only if spring was death.  Looks like I do.
vanessa,Bernadette's not going anywhere.  `Cause you're not going anywhere.
wade,"Right! The tumors are only in my liver, lungs, prostate, and brain. All the things you can live without."
vanessa,You know what I mean. You belong here at home. Surrounded by your Voltron... and your Bernadette... and your me.
wade,"Babe, we've been through this! Cancer's a real shit-show. A Yakov-Smirnoff- opening-for-the-Spin-Doctors-at-the-Iowa- State-Fair shit-show. And under no circumstances will I take you to that show. I want you to remember me me."
vanessa,"Well, I want to remember us us.  We we?"
wade,"I swear, I'll find you in the next life. And boom-box `Careless Whisper' under your window. Wham!"
vanessa,"Are you gonna keep saying it like that? Look, I get this impulse. I do. "
wade,Super fucking bad-ass.
vanessa,"But that was then, and this is now. Walk out that door. I dare you. I will ride you out. And I won't let go. Yoda on Luke."
wade, I just realized! I win! My life's officially more fucked-up than yours.
vanessa,No one's boom-boxing shit.
wade,Nothing.    Everything.
wade,"Sorry. Liam Neeson nightmare. I kidnapped his daughter, and he just wasn't having it."
weasel,Jesus. Someone needs a blow-job and a shower. Though courtesy calls for the latter first.
wade,"Three shots of Patron Silver, Weez.     And a cure to terminal cancer."
weasel, Fresh out of Patron. Wheatgrass?
wade,You're starting to sound like Vanessa...
weasel,This belongs on the wall. I want to remember you when you looked... alive.
cut to:,42. Deadpool    Final Shooting Script   11/16/15
beef,Wade.
wade,Forget your scythe?
recruiter,Mr. Wilson. Have a seat.  I understand you've recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer.
wade,Stalker alert.
recruiter,"It's my job. Recruitment. And you have quite a reputation. I'm sorry you've had a tough go. But you're a fighter. And not just for Johnny Canuck, impressive as your stint in special forces was. Forty- one confirmed kills?"
wade, One every seven weeks.     Same rate most folks get a hair-cut.
recruiter,"Now you spend your days sticking up for the little man, slitting small time throats for small time folks."
wade,People change.
recruiter," Speaking of which... Mr. Wilson, I represent an organization that may be able to help. What if I told you we can cure your cancer? And what's more, give you abilities most men only dream of?"
wade,"I'd say you sound like an infomercial. And not a good infomercial, like Slap Chop. More Shake-Weighty. "
recruiter,The world needs extraordinary men. We won't just make you better. We'll make you better than better. A super-hero.
wade,I already tried the hero business. Let's just say it left a mark. The only chance you'll see me again is if I hit `fuck- it.'
wade, De donde eres?
elderly woman,Boca Raton.
wade,Ah.   The fancy part of Mexico.
elderly man,We've moved in with my son.       To afford the treatment.
wade,Cancer?     Sorry - El Cncer?
elderly man,Stage four.
wade,Toughest part of the Tour de France.
vanessa,Very hilly.
elderly man,Logging some frequent flier miles?
wade," Final stop on Desperation World Tour, 2016, which I believe was also the name of the Stones' last concert..."
vanessa,`Final' because this is where we find the cure.
nurse,No cheques de viajero.      No pesos.   Cash. Americano.
nurse,Seor... Abe Solomon?
abe, Handsome couple. Good luck to you two.
wade,"Good luck to you, Pops."
doctor,"Buenos das, Seor Abe."
abe,"I'm sorry.     No hablo espaol, doc."
doctor,"De que se cure! Seor Abe, you are cured."
abe, Thank you. I owe you my life.
doctor, Proximo! Next!
doctor,"So sorry, you surprise me. How... long... you standing there, Seor?"
wade,Long enough...
deadpool,"Thank you, Agent Smith."
deadpool,"Some kind of anger can't be managed. Like the kind where your year-long plan ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered! That said... when it comes time to licking wounds... there's no place like home, and I share that home with someone you met, the old blind lady from the laundromat, Al. She's like Robin to my Batman. Except she's old. And black. And blind."
wade,Worse.  Just promise you'll do right by me. So I can do right by someone else.
recruiter,Of course.
wade,"Oh, and please don't make my super suit green. Or animated."
recruiter,I hope you enjoy your stay.
wade,Um.  My first request?    A warmer table.  And warmer hands.
angel dust,"You'd like that, huh.    Welcome to our little hospital."
wade,It doesn't look like a hospital. It looks like Chlamydia holding still.
angel dust,Shut.   The fuck. Up.
wade,Can I expect turndown serv-?
ajax,You're a talker.
angel dust,"What, you expected Weapon X?"
ajax,One more thing. What's the ad? `I'm not just the president. I'm a client?' I've been through this procedure myself. It made me stronger. It also scorched my nerve endings. So I no longer feel pain. In fact...  I no longer feel anything.
wade,Something in your teeth.
ajax,Joke away. The one thing that never survives this place is a sense of humor.
wade,We'll see!
ajax, All yours.
john denver,I want to share what I can give.     I want to be... I want to live!
ajax,Until you finally mutate.      Or die.
wade,Puppies.
cunningham,Or kittens. If you swing that way.
wade, I swing both ways.
cunningham,A bucket list?
wade,I prefer fuck-it list: Naked tandem base- jumping with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs... Sparking up a spliff with the Olympic torch...
cunningham,Finishing my Lego Millenium Falcon...
wade,Giving Meredith Baxter Birney a dutch oven...
cunningham,Making my kids banana pancakes...
ajax,"You are so relentlessly annoying. Shut the fuck up, or I'll sew that pretty mouth shut."
wade,"Uh, I wouldn't do that. Here's the problem with round-the-clock torture. You can't really step it up from there."
ajax,Is that what you think?
wade,Yeah.   Francis.    That's what I think.
ajax,Seems your genes are as stubborn as you. But we can still increase your suffering. We don't even have a name for this next toy.
wade,Um.   What?
ajax,"Waterboarding is the most severe stress known to man. This device prolongs that stress. For hours, days, weeks..."
angel dust,"Or if you keep yapping, years..."
wade,And I thought you were dicks before this.
ajax,"The saddest part? You still think we're making you a super-hero. You. Dishonorable discharge. Beating up pizza guys. Hip deep in hookers. You're nothing. I'd call you an asshole, but I'd have to answer to assholes. Little secret, Wade. The Workshop doesn't make super-heroes. It makes super-slaves. We're gonna fit you for a control collar and auction you to the highest bidder.  Who knows what they'll force you to do. Put down freedom fighters. Murder innocents. Or maybe just mow a lawn or two."
angel dust,There's a brave face.
wade,Seriously. Now you do have something in your teeth.
ajax,Enjoy the weekend!
angel dust, He looks like a turd in a punch-bowl.
ajax, The `Punch-Bowl!'
doctor,Mr. Wilson... these results are remarkable.
wade, Yippee.
doctor,"But... the cells have inalterably changed. They're no longer destructive, but productive, selectively targeting and replacing damaged tissue."
wade,That was a lot of... what's the word... syllables. Are you saying I'm better?
doctor,Better than better.    A miracle.
wade, Thank you. I owe you my life.
doctor,There. There. Your journey's been long and difficult. But you've become something extraordinary. Just rest now. Rest.
ajax,Oo. Someone lost his shot at homecoming king.
wade,You f-fucking sadistic-
ajax,"No. Not fair. Everything I've done to you has been in your best interest. Even this next bit. You may be cured, but you still need to learn to be a better man. Polite. Respectful. What better way to teach you than to close this lid... and keep torturing you stupid."
angel dust,Better to be the hunter than the hunted.
ajax,"Either I kill him, or he kills me.     Let's put him out of our misery..."
deadpool,There... all caught up.
blind al, Ass-hat.
deadpool,"Morning, roomie!  This place reeks like old lady pants."
blind al, Yes. I'm old. I wear pants.
deadpool,But you're no lady.
blind al,Upside of being blind:     I've never seen you in Crocs.
deadpool,You mean my big rubber masturbatin' shoes?
blind al,Yes I know. Downside of being blind:        I hear everything in this duplex.
deadpool,One-thousand eight-hundred twenty-two ornaments pinned to two-hundred-sixty calendars. All for a `Christmas' that... never... came!
blind al,"Too much naughty, too little nice."
deadpool,Sit on a stick.
blind al,Bactine?
deadpool, Yeah. Bactine should do it. How's the Kullen coming? IKEA doesn't assemble itself.
blind al,You're telling me. I don't mind the Kullen. It's an improvement on the Hurdal.
deadpool,Anything's an improvement on the Hurdal. I'd have taken a Hemnes... or even a Trysil... over the Hurdal. But I didn't get excited `til I saw the Kullen.
blind al,Screw please.
deadpool,Here? Now? Just kidding.          I know it's been decades for you.
blind al,You'd be surprised.
deadpool,And totally grossed out!
blind al,Ta.    Dah.
deadpool,And I quote: `Looking for roommate. Blind to life's imperfections. Must be good with hands.' Or wouldya rather I build IKEA and you pay rent?
blind al,Why such a douche this morning?
deadpool,Let's recap. That cock-thistle who turned me into this freak... the one I've been waiting five years for... slipped through my arms today. Arm.
blind al, I'm gonna find this `Craig.'        And I'm gonna kill him.
deadpool,"Once I've got the cure, I'm gonna do the same to Francis..."
ajax,Bloody hell. Someone lost his shot at homecoming king.
wade, What have you done to me?!
ajax,You give me too much credit. This... this is the result of your genes. 
wade,You... sadistic... fuck!
ajax,Where's the gratitude?! You're cured! Your mutated cells can heal anything. They're attacking the cancer as fast as it can form. Your insides are a war zone. Not to mention your outsides!
ajax,He's all yours.
angel,You smell like shit.
ajax, Whoa.
ajax,"You can't kill me, Wade. I'm the only one who can fix that ugly mug."
wade,Then time to make me me again.
wade,Fuck!
ajax,Say it.     `Francis.'
mother,"Alex, don't stare."
deadpool,"In the whole wide world, there's nothing as ugly...  ...as fear."
smash cut to,BLACK.
deadpool,Don't make me ask twice.     Where's Francis?!
blind al,Seltzer water and lemon for blood.  Or wear red.
deadpool,Don't make me ask twice.      Where's-
deadpool,Donde esta Francisco?
thug,I don't speak Spanish.
deadpool, And I don't have time for you to learn.
deadpool,In no particular order. Where's your boss? And where can I find good Indian food?
henchman,Why the red suit?
deadpool,"That's so bad guys can't- never mind, they've already heard that."
goon," I don't know, I'm telling you. You're just going to have to kill me."
deadpool,OK.  Right?!
deadpool,You give me your boss.     I give you the rest of your life.
deadpool, I don't feel good about myself.     But where is he? I'm so sorry.
deadpool,Agent Smith!
deadpool,"Come out, come out, wherever you are!  Good for you!"
recruiter,To whom should I address my... desperate bargaining?
deadpool,Don't recognize the voice? Maybe the resum: Forty-one confirmed kills. Make that Eighty-nine. Seven the past week alone. Same rate most folks...  ...get a shave.
recruiter, Mr... Wilson?
deadpool,Ding-ding-ding! Now... you're about to tell me where I can find your boss. Or I'm gonna make you feel worse. Wait...
recruiter,And I pride myself on being persuasive.
wade,No... no way! I'm not making her life as ugly as mine!
weasel,"C'mon, you can't look that bad! It's like that blemish no one notices but you."
wade,"Wrong. I'm a monster, inside and out. I belong in a circus, the kind that rolls around Eastern Europe in covered wagons."
weasel,I can't envision a scenario where Vanessa won't take you ba-  -aaaaaccckkk!! Holy shit. You... are... terrifying. You look like an avocado had sex with an older avocado.
wade,"And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug, the asshole who ran that mutant factory, escaped to who knows where."
weasel,I take back the Vanessa thing.      You have only one option.
wade,Find Francis-Go-Fuck-Himself.
weasel," Star in low budget horror movies. Seriously, you look like Freddy Krueger face-fucked a topographical map of Utah."
wade," I'm gonna work my way through his crew... crushing bad guys' skulls, `til one of `em leads me to Francis. Then I'll force him to cure this face. Stomp his bloody guts into a fine vintage. And win Vanessa back."
weasel,"OK. Not exactly the plot of Beauty and the Beast, but cool. Good news, that douche thinks you're dead. Advantage you. He won't think you're coming. Bad news, with a puss like that, you'll be spotted fast."
wade, So what do you suggest?     A mask?
weasel,Not a bad idea! You... are... haunting. Your face is the stuff of nightmares.
wade, Like a testicle with teeth.
weasel,How `bout a super-suit? And a nickname! Bitter-Boy. Super-Fist. Captain Never- Die. 
wade,What?
weasel,"Nothing. It's just... you know, I just realized, I'm never winning the-"
wade,Deadpool.
weasel,"Deadpool.    To you, Mr. Pool."
deadpool,Santa Claus is coming...
blind al,I hope you're doing us the courtesy of pants.
deadpool,Taxi!
woman,Keep the change.
dopinder,Where do you want to be going!
deadpool, And we all know how this turned out. Cue Benny Hill speed...
angel dust,For your flight.
ajax,Wade Fucking Wilson.
angel dust,Makes perfect sense.
ajax,"I suppose if I looked like him, I'd wear a mask too.  Only wish I mended the same."
angel dust,And if he heals?
ajax,He can't - if there's nothing left of him to heal. And then we go back to business as usual.
deadpool,There. All caught up. 
deadpool,"You can stick that where you stuck the Bactine! I found my stash of wisdom- tooth Percocet in the Storjorm, and I'm orbiting Saturn. But I appreciate the gesture."
blind al,"Am I crazy, or is your hand really small?"
deadpool,The size of a KFC spork.
blind al,Eesh. I get why you're so pissy. But your mood's never gonna brighten `til you find this woman you love and tell her how you feel!
deadpool,"What do I keep saying, Mrs. Magoo? She wouldn't have me! If you could see me, you'd understand."
blind al,"Love is blind, Wade."
deadpool,"No, you're blind."
blind al,What was that?
deadpool,A clue why our Ivar shelving unit's about to fall the fuck apart.
blind al,So you're just gonna lie there and whimper?
deadpool,Just clocking time `til this arm plows through puberty. I've got a new Christmas Day.
weasel,"Wade, we got a problem.    And by we I mean you."
deadpool,"I'm about to lose what's left of my shit. Is there a word for half-afraid, half- furious?"
weasel,"Afurious? Wait, is it Monday?! They have an amazing Matzah Ball Soup Monday.  Never mind. Have you figured what you're gonna tell her?"
deadpool, Fuck.
weasel,It's a start.
stan lee,"Coming onto the stage, give it up for... Chastity! 87. Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15"
weasel,"Or as I like to call her, Irony!"
deadpool,We gotta find her fast.    Before fuck-ass.
weasel,How do you even know she's here?
deadpool,I come for the French Onion Soup. How do you think? I'm constantly stalking that fox.
deadpool,Lezzdothis. Before I re-reconsider. Maximum effort.
manager,Someone out back asking for you. Said somethin' about an old boyfriend?
vanessa,I knew it was you.
ajax,You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.
weasel,"Manager said she went that way.  Good luck, Tiger!"
deadpool,Mother-fucker best be wearing his brown pants.
ajax,"That's what I thought, but he keeps on coming back. Like a Bad Jesus. But despite all Wade's powers, I still hold the advantage: He feels. Too strongly for his own good. Let's see how he fights with your head on the block."
deadpool,Ripley from `Alien 3'!
ntw,Deadfool.
deadpool,It's like you knew I was about to knock!  Is that big steel dildo home?
ntw,You guys going for a bite?      Early bird special?
deadpool,"Like there's something wrong with eating before sundown. Or saving money. But no. It's about me saving my girl from a bad guy, the one you two helped me lose. You do fight bad guys?  No time for hard stares, are you gonna fetch big-shiny-balls or not? Tell him I have an offer he can't refuse!"
ntw,Colossus!
deadpool,"Yep, that's me, seeing the error of my ways! I just need an itty bitty favor in return!  Fool him five times? Shame on him. 92. Deadpool    Final Shooting Script    11/16/15"
weasel,That's about... three thousand shells.
deadpool,And we've all seen what I can do with twelve.
blind al,"I was gonna spend tonight assembling the Borgsjo, but this is holding my interest."
deadpool,"Careful, Ronnie Milsap, we're down-range! And we decided on the Orrberg, not the Borgsjo."
blind al,Shit.
weasel,She cool?
deadpool,"The coolest. Plus, she could never pick you out of a line-up."
weasel," That's the shit emoji. A turd with a smile, see? How did Google ever approve that?"
blind al,That's every piece in the house.
deadpool,Uh-uh-uh.
blind al,"It was him or me.  I did hit it, right?"
deadpool,Please. It's been years since you've hit anything. See what I did there?
blind al,Fuck you.
deadpool," In case I never see you again, I love you very much... and there's a hundred-ten million dollars buried somewhere in the apartment. Good luck. Watch your face."
deadpool,Any luck winning Gita back?
dopinder,"I tried to hold on tight, Mr. Pool. But Bandhu is more craftier - and handsomer - than me."
deadpool, It's all relative.
deadpool,"Oh, please. I'll bet the halls of your high school were very well monitored."
dopinder,I cannot be stopping.
dopinder,She indeed has ESPN!    I am quite uninsuranced.
deadpool,You mean ESP. But come on!      I coulda-
deadpool,Gaaaahhhh!
dopinder,Who brought this twinkly man?
deadpool,"Twinkly, but deadly. My big Russki friend doesn't like the idea of a whole new army of mutant mutton-heads. And I told him if he did me this solid, I'd consider joining his boy band."
colossus,It's not a boy band.
deadpool,Sure it's not.
deadpool,Uh.   Dopinder. What was that?
dopinder,"Oh, that?      That was Bandhu."
colossus,Bandwho?
dopinder,"My romantic rival, Bandhu. He's tied up in the trunk. I'm doing as you said, D.P. I plan to gut him like a tandoori fish. Then dump his lifeless corpse on Gita's doorstep like a cat with a dead bird. Mom and Dad will be over the moon."
deadpool,Something must've gotten lost in the translation. 
dopinder,"Fine, fine. Safe and gentle-like.          Here we are..."
deadpool,For you?    Ten.
dopinder,"Knock em dead, Pool Boy."
deadpool,Time to make the chimichangas.
deadpool," It happens. A'ight, cue up DMX again."
dopinder,Bandhu?
deadpool, Gimme a beat!
deadpool,"Long term, that's hard on your knees.  ...I brought him."
colossus,I'd prefer not to hit a woman. So please place your hands behind your-
deadpool, I also brought her.
angel dust,Never mind. Fire.
deadpool, Finish fucking her the fuck up.
colossus,Language.    Please.
ajax,"How does it feel? Ex-boyfriend abandons you, becomes a sanity-challenged killer mutant in tights..."
vanessa,Says the sanity-challenged killer mutant in parachute pants. P.S. I've never played the role of damsel in distress.
ajax,`Til now.
deadpool,"Hey, fellas, whoa! Hold on!        Don'tcha wanna hear my terms?!"
colossus,"Uh... you seem to have, um..."
deadpool,Tea-bag!  Bob?!
bob,Wade?!
deadpool,It's been since... Jacksonville!
bob,TGIFridays.
deadpool,Liked the Loaded Potato Skins.     Didn't like you.
bob,Ditto.
deadpool,"Bob, y'mind taking a half-step right? No, your right. Never mind-"
ajax,That never gets old.    But neither will you.
deadpool,Light the candle...
deadpool,Your plan to trip me to death?      Has failed.
vanessa,Wade?
ajax, What better way to climb back in your head...
deadpool,You never left.
vanessa," But you did, asshole."
ajax,You two have a lot to work out. Take a deep breath. Wait. Wrong choice...
deadpool,I hope they blocked pain to your every last nerve. `Cause I'm'a go looking.
ajax,I hear you grow back parts. When I get done... parts will have to grow back you.
deadpool,Good one.
deadpool,Yowww!
ajax,Fine.   Fists.
deadpool,Sounds like your last Saturday night.  The sense of humor survived.
john denver,I want to liiiiiive!
angel dust,"C'mere, ya little bitch."
vanessa,If we survive this.   I'm gonna kill you.
deadpool,We have so much to catch up on.
colossus,You're OK.     Take it slow.
deadpool,I'm good.
ajax,"Sorry. It's just. All this time, you bought that I have the cure? I'm flattered. But do I really look like the scientist type? You want the guy behind the guy. His name's Dr. Killebrew. And he's long gone. Who knows where."
deadpool,Um.    What?
ajax,You heard me.
deadpool,"You mean to say, after five long years, I've been chasing the wrong monkey?"
ajax,Sounds even stupider when you say it.
deadpool,Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?  Francis.
deadpool,I'm sorry?
colossus,Four or five moments.      That's all it takes...
deadpool,To...?
colossus,"Be a hero. Everyone thinks it's a full time job. Wake up a hero. Brush your teeth a hero. Go to work a hero. Not true. Over a lifetime, there are only four or five moments that really matter. Moments when you're offered a choice. To make a sacrifice. Conquer a flaw. Save a friend. Spare an enemy."
deadpool,"You were droning on!  I may be stuck looking like pepperoni flatbread, but at least we've heard the last of him. If wearing super-hero tights means sparing psychopaths, maybe I wasn't meant to wear `em. Not everyone monitors a hall like you."
colossus,Just promise-
deadpool,I'll be on the lookout for the next four moments. 
vanessa, Worth it.
deadpool, That's what I love about y-
vanessa,Start talking.
deadpool,I'm so sorry. For leaving. And taking so long to cowboy up. It's been a rough few years.
vanessa, Rough?
deadpool,"I live in a crack house. With a family of twelve. At night, we spoon for warmth. Everyone fights for Noelle. She's the fattest. "
vanessa,So you live in a house! 
deadpool,I woulda found you before now. But the guy behind this mask isn't the same guy you remember.
vanessa,You mean this mask?
deadpool,And this one. In case the other fell off.
vanessa,You mean like this?
deadpool,Oo. Ah.    Quicker - like a Bandaid!    Owww-
vanessa,Sure I'm sure.
deadpool, I understand.
vanessa, Kidding! Get over yourself!        I'd hit that shit.
deadpool,You already did.  Twice. Seriously?
vanessa, It's a face... I'd be happy to sit on.
deadpool,I'm also not the same under these pants.  Super-penis.
deadpool,Gah! What the hell are you two still doing here?!  Gaaaaaaahhhhhh!
deadpool, ...five mini lion robots forming a large super robot.
deadpool,"Now, I meant it, both of you, fire up the Blackbird and shoo! Scram! Vamoose! Skedaddle! Don't make me keep thinking of these!"
volunteer,Can you make me better?
deadpool," You're still here? It's over! Go home. Wait... you expected a tease for Deadpool 2?! Sorry, we're low on dough. But if you can keep a secret, I can tell you who's gonna be in it. Cable! Someone suggested Mel Gibson for the role, buuuut- I was thinking Liam Neeson. Only problem, Liam likes to get paid. And more for Liam means less for me. Maybe we'll crowdfund the shit. Just you and me, kids. Shalom!"
