edward,I beg your pardon ?
vivian,"Well, doesn't it blow your mind ? This is only four cylinders."
edward,You know about cars. Where did that come from ?
vivian,"Road and Track. The boys back home I grew up with, they were really into American heavy metal : Mustangs, Corvettes."
edward,Ah.  LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT
vivian,They bought them cheap and fixed them up. I paid attention. So how is it you know so little about cars ?
edward,My first car was a limousine.
vivian,Oh.
edward,So where is this...
edward,...heavy metal... home ?
vivian,"Milledgeville, Georgia. You know, I think you left your transmission back there. You're not shifting right. This is a standard H."
edward,Standard H. Like I know what that means.
edward,Have you ever driven a Lotus ?
vivian,No.
edward,You're gonna start right now.  HOLLYWOOD - A WIDE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT
vivian,You're joking.
edward,No. It's the only way I can get you off my coat.
vivian,Fasten your seat belts. I am taking you for the ride of your life. I'm gonna show you what this car can really do. Are you ready ?
edward,I am ready.
vivian,Hang on.
edward,Okay.
vivian,Here we go.
vivian,"This has pedals like a race car. They're really close together. So it's probably easier for a woman to drive, because they have little feet. Except me. I wear a size nine."
vivian,You know your foot's as big as your arm from your elbow to your wrist ?
vivian,Did you know that ?
edward,"No, I didn't know that."
vivian,It's a little bit of trivia.
edward,"Tell me, what kind of... what kind of money you girls make these days ? Ballpark."
vivian,Can't take less than a hundred dollars.
edward,A hundred dollars a night ?
vivian,For an hour.
edward,An hour ? You make a hundred dollars an hour and you got a safety pin holding your boot up ? You gotta be joking.
vivian,I never joke about money.
edward,Neither do I. Hundred dollars an hour. Pretty stiff.
vivian,"Well, no. But it's got potential."
hotel attendant,"Good evening, Mr. Lewis. Will you be needing the car anymore tonight ?"
vivian,Ah. You're here.
edward,"Yeah. He looks at her for a couple of second, before talking again."
edward,So you'll be all right ?
vivian,"Yeah, I'm gonna grab a cab with my twenty bucks."
edward,Go back to your office.
vivian,Yeah. My office. Yeah.
edward,"Well, thanks for the ride."
vivian,See you.
edward,Good-bye.
vivian,"No, I like the bus. Edward walks to the bench on which Vivian is sitting."
edward,I was thinking... Did you really say a hundred dollars an hour ?
vivian,Yeah.
edward,"Yeah... Well, if you don't have any prior engagements, I'd be very pleased if you would accompany me into the hotel."
vivian,You got it. She gets off the bench and laughs.
vivian,What is your name ?
edward,Edward.
vivian,Edward. That's my favorite name in the whole world !
edward,No ?!
vivian,"I tell you what, this is fate, Edward. That's what this is."
edward,Why don't you put this on ?
vivian,Why ?
edward,"Well, this hotel is not the kind of establishment that rents rooms by the hour."
vivian,Ah.  REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT
vivian,Wow !
edward,You're gonna be fine. Come with me. And stop fidgeting. Another medium shots on seated guests staring at the couple.
female receptionist,"Good evening, Mr. Lewis."
edward,Hello. You have messages ?
female receptionist,"Yes, we have several."
edward,Thank you.
edward,"Could you send up some champagne and strawberries, please ?"
female receptionist,Of course.
female receptionist,"Room service for Mr. Lewis, please."
vivian,"Oh, honey. You know what's happened ? I've got a runner in my pantyhose."
vivian,I'm not wearing pantyhose.
vivian,"Well, color me happy ! There's a sofa in here for two."
edward,First time in an elevator.
vivian,"Sorry, I couldn't help it."
edward,Try.
dennis,Penthouse.
vivian,The penthouse. Mmmm !
edward,Yes.
edward,To the left.
vivian,Oh.
edward,"Oh, I miss keys."
edward,Impressed ?
vivian,"You kidding me ? I come here all the time. As a matter of fact, they do rent this room by the hour."
edward,"Sure they do. Edward has been taking a newspaper left by an attendant on a small table near the front door. He crosses the room and and drops the newspaper on the desk. He sits down behind the desk, and starts looking through his mail, while Vivian walks out on the terrace."
edward,"I'll take your word for it, because I don't go out there."
vivian,Why don't you go out there ?
edward,I'm afraid of heights.
vivian,You are ?
vivian,So how come you rented the penthouse ?
edward,"It's the best. I looked all around for penthouses on the first floor, but I can't find one."
vivian,"Well, now that you have me here, what are you going to do with me ?"
edward,Want to know something ? I don't have a clue.
vivian,No ?
edward,I hadn't exactly planned this.
vivian,"Well, do you plan everything ?"
edward,Always.
vivian,Yeah. Me too. She sits down on an armchair.
vivian,"I'm actually... No, I'm not a planner. I wouldn't say I was a planner. I would say I was, hum, a kind of fly by the seat of my pants girl. You know, moment to moment. That's me. That's... Yeah."
vivian,"Mm-hmm. You know, you could pay me. That's one way to maybe break the ice."
edward,"Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Uh, I assume cash is acceptable."
vivian,"Cash works for me, yeah."
edward,You're on my fax.
vivian,"Well, that's one I haven't been on before."
edward,Cute. Very cute. Thank you.
vivian,"All right. Here we go. Pick one. I got red, I got green, I got yellow. I'm out of purple, but I do have one gold circle coin left. The condom of champions. The one and only. Nothing is getting through this sucker. What d'you say ? Hmm ?"
edward,A buffet of safety.
vivian,I'm a safety girl.
vivian,"All right, let's get one of these on you."
edward,"No, no. I..."
edward,"Why don't we just talk for a little bit, okay ?"
vivian,"Talk. Yeah... uh... okay. Edward, are you in town on, uh, business or pleasure ?"
edward,"Business, I think."
vivian,"Business, you think."
vivian,Well... let me guess.
vivian,That would make you... a lawyer.
edward,A lawyer ?
vivian,Mm-hmm.
edward,What makes you think I'm a lawyer ?
vivian,"You've got that, um... sharp, useless look about you."
edward,I bet you've known a lot of lawyers.
vivian,I've known a lot of everybody.
vivian,What is that ?
edward,Champagne.
vivian,Oh ! Well. Might as well make myself useful. Take a load off.
vivian,Hi.
vivian,Where would we like it ?
edward,"Uh, over by the bar."
vivian,Excuse me !
edward,Thank you.
vivian,What are you looking at ?
vivian,What is he looking at ?
edward,"Ah, yes. Here you go. Thank you very much."
vivian,A tip. Wow. I missed that one. Oh.  Stupid.
edward,Don't worry about it. Edward sets the champagne glasses on the bar.
vivian,You mind if I take my boots off ?
edward,Not at all.
vivian,"So, do you have a wife ? Girlfriend ?"
edward,I have both.
vivian,Where are they ? Shopping together ?
edward,My ex-wife... is now in Long Island... in my ex-home... with my ex-dog.
edward,There you go.
edward,"My ex-girlfriend, Jessica, is in New York... moving out of my apartment even as we speak."
edward,Why don't you try a strawberry ?
vivian,Why ?
edward,It brings out the flavor in the champagne.
vivian,"Oh, groovy. She takes a strawberry and eats it. Edward closes the bowl and brings it back on the bar. He sits down on a stool."
vivian,Pretty good. Don't you drink ?
edward,No.
vivian,"Listen, I... I appreciate this whole seduction scene you've got going, but let me give you a tip : I'm a sure thing, okay ? So, I'm on an hourly rate. Could we just move it along ?"
edward,Somehow I'm sensing that this time problem is a major issue with you.
edward,Why don't we just get through that right now ?
vivian,"Great, let's get started."
edward,How much for the entire night ?
vivian,Stay here ?   You couldn't afford it.
edward,Try me.
vivian,Three hundred dollars.
edward,Done. Thank you. Now we can relax.
vivian,"Are you sure you want me to stay for the entire night ? I mean, I could just pop you good and be on my way."
edward,"To tell you the truth, I don't feel like being alone tonight."
vivian,Why ? Is it your birthday or something ?
edward,No.
vivian,"I mean, I have been the party at a couple of birthdays."
edward,I bet you have.
vivian,So what do you want me to do ?
edward,I don't know. I really don't know.
vivian,I'll be out in just a minute. That champagne kind of got to me.
edward,"I didn't hear you. What did you say ? Vivian hides something behind her back, but her hand in her back can be seen in one of the bathroom mirror."
vivian,Uh... I said I'd be out in just a minute.
edward,"What is... What do you have in, uh, your hand there ? What are you hiding ?"
vivian,Nothing.
edward,"All right, look. I do not want any drugs here. I don't want any of this. Get your things and your money and please leave. She gets rid of his hand."
vivian,"I don't do drugs, all right ? I... I stopped doing drugs when I was fourteen."
edward,What is this ? What is this ?
edward,This is dental floss.
vivian,Yeah ? So ? I had all those strawberry seeds. And you shouldn't neglect your gums.
edward,I'm sorry. Please continue.
vivian,Thank you.
vivian,Are you gonna watch ?
edward,"No, I'm going. He gives the handbag back to her."
vivian,Thank you.
edward,"It's just that, uh, very few people surprise me."
vivian,"Yeah, well, you're lucky. Most of them shock the hell out of me."
vivian,You're watching.
edward,I'm going. He closes the door. Vivian starts cleaning her teeth with dental floss.
edward,Uh-huh. I've got them from London. I need them now from Tokyo. I'll call down and get them when I want them. Thank you very much.
vivian,I have a little carpet picnic here. Are you sure you don't want a drink ?
edward,I'm high on life. Can't you tell ?
vivian,What do you want ?
edward,What do you do ?
vivian,Everything. But I don't kiss on the mouth.
edward,Neither do I.
barney,"Good morning, gentlemen.  ONE OF THE UNIFORMED ATTENDANT Good morning, Mr. Thompson."
barney,"Good morning, good morning."
another attendant,"Good morning, sir."
barney,"Good morning, Marjorie."
edward,Of course Morse is going to fight. It's to be expected. He's run his company for a very long time now. I don't think he's ready to have his name taken off the stationery.
philip,"He wants to meet you face to face, hmm..."
edward,"Sure, you wouldn't. But do it anyhow. Tonight. Dinner. Set it up."
philip,"Oh, Edward, Edward. I... Look, it's really not a good idea that you see him."
philip,Definitely not alone.   ...we could wind up in court.
edward,"Well, you know, there's always a possibility things are gonna go wrong."
edward,"That's why I enjoy this so much. Oh, by the way, Phil, about your car."
philip,"Oh, God. What ?"
edward,It corners like it's on rails.
philip,What ? What does that mean ?
vivian,Hi.
edward,"Well, good morning."
vivian,Red.
edward,Better.
vivian,Y...You didn't wake me. I can see you're really busy. I'm gonna be out of here in just a minute.
edward,"No, there's no hurry. Are you hungry ? You must be."
edward,Why don't you sit and have something to eat ?
edward,"I, uh, took the liberty of ordering everything on the menu."
edward,I didn't know what you'd like.
vivian,Thanks.
edward,All right ? Good.
edward,Did you sleep well ?
vivian,"Yeah, too good."
edward,Occupational hazard ?
vivian,Yeah. Did you sleep ?
edward,"Uh, yes, a little, on the couch."
edward,"I was, uh, working last night."
vivian,"You don't sleep, you don't do drugs, you don't drink, you hardly eat. What do you do, Edward ? Because I know you're not a lawyer."
edward,That's right.
edward,There are four other chairs here.
vivian,Oh.
vivian,So what do you do ?
edward,I buy companies.
vivian,What kind of companies ?
edward,"Uh, I buy companies that are in financial difficulty."
vivian,"If they have problems, you must get them for a bargain, huh ?"
edward,"Well, the company I'm buying this week, I'm getting for the bargain price of about one billion."
vivian,A billion dollars ?
edward,Yes.
vivian,"Wow. You must be really smart, huh ?"
vivian,I only got through the eleventh grade. How far did you go in school ?
edward,I went all the way.
vivian,"Your folks must be really proud, huh ?"
vivian,"So you don't actually have a billion dollars, huh ?"
edward,"No, I get some of it from banks, investors. It's not an easy thing to do."
vivian,And you don't make anything.
edward,No.
vivian,And you don't build anything.
edward,No.
vivian,So what do you do with the companies once you buy them ?
edward,I sell them.
vivian,"Here, let me do that."
vivian,You sell them ?
edward,"Well, I... don't sell the whole company. I break it up into pieces... and then I sell that off. It's worth more than the whole. Close Up shot on Edward's necktie, and Vivian's hands knotting it."
vivian,"So it's sort of like, um, stealing cars and selling them for the parts, right ?"
edward,"Yeah, sort of. But legal."
edward,Mm-hmm.
edward,Not bad. Not bad at all. Where'd you learn to do that ?
vivian,"Well, I screwed the debate team in high school."
vivian,"I had a grandpa ! He was nice to me. He liked ties on Sundays. Mind if I, um, take a swim in your tub before I go ?"
edward,"Not at all. Just stay in the shallow end. He goes out of the bathroom, followed, a couple of seconds later, by Vivian."
philip,"Edward, it's Phil. Listen, I'm running out the door."
edward,"Oh, that's good."
philip,He's grooming him to take over. I don't know.
edward,"Ah, yes. Very intense young man named David. He plays polo."
philip,"Look, I gotta say this again. I don't like you going alone, you know."
edward,"Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm here."
edward,Housekeeping is singing.
philip,Yeah... listen.
edward,"No, you don't."
edward,"Besides, I already have one."
edward,You just concentrate on finding out what Morse is up to.
edward,I'm on my way.
vivian,Don't you just love Prince ?
edward,More than life itself.
vivian,Don't you knock ?
edward,"Vivian, I have a business proposition for you."
vivian,What do you want ?
edward,I'm gonna be in town until Sunday. I'd like you to spend the week with me.
vivian,Really ?
edward,"Yes. Yes, I'd like to hire you as an employee. Would you consider spending the week with me ?"
edward,I will pay you to be at my beck and call.
vivian,"Look, I'd love to be your beck and call girl, but, uh, you're a rich, good-looking guy. You could get a million girls free."
edward,I want a professional. I don't need any romantic hassles this week.
vivian,"If you're talking twenty-four hours a day, it's gonna cost you."
edward,"Oh, yes, of course !"
edward,"All right, here we go. Give me a ballpark figure. How much ?"
vivian,"Six full nights, days too. Four thousand."
edward,Six nights at three hundred is eighteen hundred.
vivian,You want days too.
edward,Two thousand.
vivian,Three thousand.
edward,Done.
vivian,Holy shit !
edward,Vivian ?
edward,"Vivian, is that a yes ?"
vivian,Yes.
vivian,Yes !
edward,I'll be gone most of the day. I want you to buy some clothes.
vivian,You really should think about traveler's checks.
edward,We may be going out evenings. You'll need something to wear.
vivian,Like what ?
edward,"Uh, nothing too flashy. Not too sexy."
edward,Conservative. You understand ?
vivian,Boring.
edward,Elegant. Any questions ?
vivian,Can I call you Eddie ?
edward,Not if you expect me to answer.
vivian,I would've stayed for two thousands.
edward,I would've paid four. I'll see you tonight.
vivian,"Baby, I'm gonna treat you so nice, you're never gonna wanna let me go."
edward,"Three thousand for six days. And, Vivian, I will let you go."
vivian,But I'm here now.
vivian,Three thousand dollars !
vivian,Oof !
kit,Hello ?
vivian,I called and called. Where were you last night ?
kit,Ma ?
kit,Oh. Hi. I had to party. Where are you ?
vivian,"Oh, man. Are you ready for this ? The guy ? The Lotus ? I am in his hotel room in Beverly Hills. The penthouse. His bathroom is bigger than the Blue Banana !"
kit,Do I have to hear this ?
vivian,"Kit, he wants me to stay the whole week. And you know what he's gonna give me ?"
kit,Bullshit !
vivian,I swear to God. And extra money to buy clothes.
kit,"Oh, man ! I am bummed. I gave that guy to you !"
kit,Three thousand. Really ? Is he twisted ?
vivian,No.
vivian,"He's good-looking ! KIT  Well, what's wrong with him ?"
vivian,Nothing.
kit,Did he give you the money yet ?
kit,That's what's wrong with him.
vivian,"Well, he gave me three hundred for last night. And, Kit ?"
vivian,I'm gonna leave some at the front desk for you. I want you to pick it up.
kit,Reg... Bev... Wil.

kit,"Rodeo Drive, baby."
barney,Ah !

vivian,Don't open that.
miss wilson,"No, ma'am."
barney,Arrivederci.
barney,"Miss Wilson, do you know that lady ?"
miss wilson,"No, sir."
lyrics,Wild women do. And they don't regret it.
lyrics,Wild women show what they're going through. The camera crosses the street on a crosswalk. Vivian is walking on this crosswalk.
lyrics,Ooh ! Wild women do what you think you'll never.
lyrics,What you only dream about wild women do.
lyrics,"Oh, yes, they do. Vivian keeps on walking looking up at the emblems. She apparently doesn't notice that several pedestrians are looking at her, surprised by her costume."
lyrics,You tell me you want a woman who is simple as a flower.
lyrics,"Well, if you want me to act like that, you've got to pay me by the hour."
lyrics,Wild women do and they don't regret it.
lyrics,"Oh, wild women show what they're going through."
lyrics,"Oooh-whoo ! Ooh, yeah."
lyrics,Wild women do what you think you'll never.
vivian,"Well, I'm just checking things out.  SALESWOMAN # 1 Are you looking for something in particular ?"
vivian,"No. Well, yeah. Uh... something... conservative."
vivian,You got nice stuff.
vivian,How much is this ?
vivian,"Well, I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was. The saleswoman # 1 turns toward her colleague."
vivian,"Look, I got money to spend in here."
woman's voice,Doctor's office ? Two blocks down and to your left.
man's voice,Thank you.
barney,"Excuse me, miss, may I help you ?"
vivian,I'm going to my room.
barney,"Uh, do you have a key ?"
vivian,Oh. I forgot that cardboard thing. I'm on the top floor.
barney,You're a guest here ?
vivian,I'm with a friend.
barney,And who would that be ?
vivian,Edward.
barney,Edward ?
vivian,"Edward... Edward, uh..."
barney,Mm-hmmm.
vivian,He knows me.
barney,Dennis.
barney,"Dennis, did you just come off the night shift ? Hmm ?"
dennis,"Yes, sir."
barney,Do you know this young lady ?
dennis,She's with Mr. Lewis.
barney,Mr. Lewis ?
vivian,"That's it. Edward Lewis ! Thanks, Dennis."
dennis,Evidently she joined him last night.
barney,Thank you.
vivian,What is with everybody today ?
barney,"No, no. It's all right. Just come with me. We'll have a little chat. Thank you. Dennis, thank you."
vivian,I'm coming. I'm coming.
barney,"Don't play with me, young lady."
vivian,Vivian.
barney,Thank you. Vivian.
barney,"Well, Miss Vivian. Things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. Now, Mr. Lewis, however, is a very special customer, and we like to think of our special customers as friends. Now, as a customer, we would expect Mr. Lewis to sign in any additional guests, but as a friend, we're willing to overlook it. Now, I'm assuming that you're a..."
barney,Relative ?
vivian,Yes.
barney,Mm-hmmm. I thought so. Then you must be his...
vivian,Niece ?
barney,"Of course. Naturally, when Mr. Lewis leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again. I assume you have no other uncles here."
barney,Good ! Then we understand each other. I would also encourage you... to dress a little more appropriately. that'll be all. Vivian raises her hands and her voice.
vivian,"No, that's not all. That's what I was trying to do. I tried to go... get a dress on Rodeo Drive today, and the women wouldn't help me. And I have all this money now and no dress !"
vivian,"Not that I expect you to help me, but I have all of this, okay ? I have to buy a dress for dinner tonight. And nobody will help me."
vivian,"Oh, man, if you're calling the cops. Yeah, call the cops. That's great. Tell 'em I said hi."
barney,Women's clothing.
barney,"Bridget, please."
barney,"Yes, Bridget. Hello. This is Barnard Thompson here at the Regent Beverly Wil...   Well, thank you. Yes, but I'd like you to do a favor for me, please. I'm sending someone over. Her name is Vivian."
philip,"Edward, we just got the Morse update. Don, can you hold the projection, please ?"
philip,"Yeah, what ? Speak."
philip,Navy contract. I can't believe this shit. I thought you said they had nothing in the hopper on this one !
mark,"Hey, you know, if that's true it could cost a lot more. Those stocks could go through the roof."
philip,"Yeah, no shit, Sherlock."
philip,"Walk away ? Hey, forget it, pal. We got a thousand man- hours in on this ! Nobody's walking away from anything !"
mark,"Philip, I think he's right."
edward,"Gentlemen, relax !"
edward,Relax ! Who do we know on the Senate Appropriations Committee ?
philip,Senator Adams.
edward,"All right, Senator Adams. Let's find out where he is."
edward,The Navy's not going to spend 350 million dollar on anything without going to Appropriations first.
philip,"I don't understand what's going on here today, gentlemen."
edward,"That's why I hired you, Phil, to do my worrying for me."
edward,"I'll be in your office. Bob, if you want to send over the geologicals ?"
edward,Thank you.
philip,"Listen, everything all set for the meeting tonight ?"
edward,Mm-hmm. We hear faint voices coming from the meeting room.
philip,Who... Who is this girl you're going with ?
edward,Nobody you know.
bridget,"Don't worry, Mrs. Rainey, I'll call you the minute it comes in."
mrs rainey,Thank you.
bridget,Have a nice day.
mrs rainey,Thank you.
bridget,Hello. You must be Vivian. My name's Bridget.
vivian,"Yeah, hi. Barney said you'd be nice to me. They both laugh."
bridget,He's very sweet. What are your plans while you're in town ?
vivian,We're gonna have dinner.
bridget,"Oh, don't sit on there, dear !"
vivian,Oh !
bridget,You're gonna go out ? Dinner ?
vivian,Mm-hmm.
bridget,"Well, you'll need a cocktail dress then. Come with me."
bridget,"Now, I'm sure we're gonna find something here that your uncle will love. You're a size six, right ?"
vivian,Yeah. How'd you know that ?
bridget,"Oh, that's my job. They start walking upstairs to the upper level."
vivian,"Bridg, he's not really my uncle."
bridget,"They never are, dear."
vivian,Barney !
vivian,"Sorry, mister."
vivian,I got a dress !
barney,"Well, I'd rather hoped you'd be wearing it."
vivian,"Oh, no, I didn't want to get it messed up ! Listen, I got shoes too. You wanna see ?"
barney,"No, that won't be necessary. I'm sure they're quite lovely. Thank you."
vivian,"Okay, well, listen. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but Bridget was really great... and I just wanted to say thanks. You're cool."
barney,"You're welcome, Miss Vivian."
vivian,Hello ?  EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - RECEPTION HALL - INTERIOR DAY
edward,"Never, ever pick up the phone."
vivian,Then why are you calling me ?
vivian,I got a dress. A cocktail one.
edward,"I'll be in the hotel lobby, 7:45 sharp."
edward,This isn't a date. It's business.
vivian,"Where are you taking me, anyway ?"
edward,I'm taking you to a restaurant called the Voltaire.
vivian,"All right. I'll meet you in the lobby, but only 'cause you're paying me to."
edward,"Well, thank you very much."
the secretary,Mr. Stuckey wanted to see you.
edward,"Yes, tell him I'm in the middle of a very important phone call."
vivian,Hello ?
vivian,Then stop calling me.
vivian,Sick.
vivian,Barney !
barney,It didn't fit ?
vivian,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Uh... I've got a little problem.  REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY"
barney,"Shrimp fork, salad fork, dinner fork."
vivian,I definitely have the salad fork. The rest of the silverware is a little confusing.
barney,"All right, if you get nervous, just count the tines. Four tines : dinner fork. And sometimes there are three tines in the salad fork. And sometimes...  REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - EXTERIOR LATE AFTERNOON"
barney,"Pardon me, Mr. Lewis. I'm Mr. Thompson. I'm the manager of the hotel."
edward,"Uh-huh. Excuse me, I just want to make one call."
barney,"Yes, um, sir. I have a message for you, sir."
edward,From who ?
barney,"From your niece, sir."
edward,My what ?
barney,"The young lady who's staying with you in your room, sir."
edward,Oh. Hmm.
edward,I think we both know that she's not my niece.
barney,Of course.
edward,The reason I know that is that I am an only child.
barney,"Yes, sir."
edward,What's the message ?
barney,"She's waiting for you in the lounge. Intriguing young lady, Miss Vivian."
edward,Intriguing.
barney,"Have a good evening, sir."
edward,"Thank you, Mr... ?"
barney,Thompson. I'm the manager...
barney,"...manager of the hotel, sir."
vivian,You're late.
edward,You're stunning.
vivian,You're forgiven.
edward,Shall we go to dinner ?
edward,"Stop fidgeting. Closer high angle shot of Vivian and Edward walking toward a table where two men, an old one and a younger one, are already seated."
edward,Mr. Morse.
james morse,"Yes, Mr. Lewis. I'm Jim Morse."
james morse,"This fireball is my grandson, David."
david morse,"Well, I don't know about the fireball part, but grandson is true enough."
edward,"I'm pleased to meet you both. This is a friend of mine, Vivian Ward."
vivian,Hi. I'm really glad to meet you.
edward,Mr. Morse. David.
edward,"Please, sit."
edward,Where are you going ?
vivian,I'm going to the ladies' room.
edward,"Upstairs, to the right."
vivian,Okay. Excuse me.
edward,Shall I order for you ?
vivian,Yeah.
vivian,Please do so. Thank you.
edward,I'll do that.
vivian,Where's the salad ?
edward,"Uh, the salad comes at the end of the meal."
vivian,That's the fork I knew.
james morse,"I don't know about you, but I've never been able to figure which goes with what !"
vivian,Who ordered this ?
edward,These are escargot. It's French for snails. It's a delicacy. Try it. David ?
david morse,"Mr. Lewis, if you were to get control... and I don't think you will... but if you did, what do you plan to do with the company ?"
edward,Break it up and sell off the pieces.
james morse,I'm sure you'll understand I'm not thrilled at the idea... of your turning forty years of my work into your garage sale.
james morse,I'm rich enough. I just want to head my shipyard.
vivian,Slippery little suckers.
james morse,I met your father. What's his name ?
edward,Carter.
james morse,He's not quite the bastard everybody says he is.
edward,"No, I have the franchise on that."
james morse,Does that make him proud ?
edward,I doubt it. It doesn't really matter now. He passed away.
james morse,"Oh, I hadn't heard. I'm sorry."
vivian,I'm sorry too.
edward,"Mr. Morse, you asked for this meeting. What can I do for you ?"
james morse,Leave my company alone.
edward,I can't do that. I own ten million shares.
james morse,I'll buy your stock back.
edward,You don't have the money.
david morse,We will. We're getting a contract to build ten destroyers.
edward,There will be no contract. The contract is now buried in Appropriations Committee. And it will remain there.
david morse,And how the hell did you pull something like that ? You got dirty politicians in your pockets now or something ?
james morse,Mr. Lewis plays hardball.
edward,"Yes, yes, I do."
david morse,"I've heard enough of this. Vivian, it was a great pleasure to meet you. I'm sorry, Grandfather. I've gotta get some air. Mr. Lewis. He stands up and walks away."
james morse,I'd better join my grandson. You two enjoy your dinner.
james morse,"I'm sure it'll be delicious. Good luck, miss."
james morse,"Watch out, Lewis. I'm gonna tear you apart."
edward,"I look forward to it, sir."
edward,"Rich people throw their napkins a lot, don't they ?"
vivian,He seems like a nice man.
edward,"I guess three thousand dollars does not buy loyalty, does it ?"
vivian,I just mean it's sweet the way he's crazy about his grandson.
edward,"Oh, his grandson thinks he's a relic. He hates that he does, but he does."
edward,"No, just the two."
vivian,It's ketchup.
the waiter,"Yes, sir."
the waiter,"Yes, sir."
vivian,Haven't they ever seen ketchup before ?
edward,Not in this building.
vivian,"Edward, you said you never come out here."
edward,"Well, I'm only halfway out."
vivian,Didn't say much in the car on the way home. You thinking about dinner ? I was a maniac.
vivian,"I mean, the business was good, I think. You know ?"
vivian,He's in trouble. You want his company. He doesn't want to let it go.
edward,Thanks for the recap.
vivian,"The problem is, I think you liked Mr. Morse."
edward,What I would like is for you to get down from there. You're making me very nervous. Please come down.
vivian,It's making you nervous ? What if I just leaned back a little bit like this ?
vivian,Would you... Would you rescue me if I fell ?
edward,"Vivian, I'm serious. Come... I'm not looking."
vivian,It's really high.
vivian,"Look, no hands, no hands ! Okay, all right. I'm sorry."
edward,"The truth is, it really is totally irrelevant whether I like this man or not."
edward,I will not let myself become emotionally involved in business.
vivian,"I know. Kit's always saying to me, Don't get emotional when you turn tricks. That's why no kissing. It's too personal."
vivian,"It's like what you're saying : You stay numb, you don't get involved. When I'm with a guy, I'm like a robot. I just do it."
vivian,I mean... except with you.
edward,"Oh, of course, not with me. You and I are such similar creatures, Vivian. We both screw people for money."
vivian,I was sorry to hear about your dad. When did he die ?
edward,Last month.
vivian,Do you miss him ?
edward,I hadn't spoken to him in fourteen and a half years. I wasn't there when he died.
vivian,Do you want to talk about this ?
edward,No.
vivian,"Well, I tell you what, 'cause I got an idea."
vivian,Let's watch old movies all night. We'll just veg out in front of the TV.
edward,Veg out ?
vivian,Yeah. Be still like vegetables. Lay like broccoli.
edward,"Look, I'll tell you what. I'll be back. We'll do broccoli tomorrow. He strokes her chin very delicately. She stands up."
vivian,Where are you going ?
edward,I'm going downstairs for a while.
vivian,"Hi, uh, I'm in the penthouse. The guy that was here, Mr. Lewis, have you seen him down there anywhere ?"
edward,Thank you. Thank you very much.
vivian,I didn't know you played.
edward,I only play for strangers.
vivian,I was getting lonely upstairs all by myself. Edward turns around.
edward,"Gentlemen, would you mind leaving us, please ?"
edward,Thank you.
vivian,People always do what you tell them to do ?
vivian,I guess so.
edward,"Now, if you have any trouble using this card, have them call the hotel. All right ?"
vivian,Oh ! More shopping.
edward,Mm-hmm. I'm surprised you didn't buy more than one dress yesterday.
vivian,Wasn't as much fun as I thought it was gonna be.
edward,Why not ?
vivian,They were mean to me.
edward,Mean to you ?
vivian,People are looking at me.
edward,They're not looking at you. They're looking at me.
vivian,The stores are not nice to people. I don't like it.
edward,Stores are never nice to people. They're nice to credit cards.
edward,"Okay, stop fidgeting."
vivian,All right.
edward,Get rid of your gum.
edward,I don't believe you did that.
edward,Yes ?
hollister,"I am Mr. Hollister, the manager. May I help you ?"
edward,Edward Lewis.
hollister,"Ah, yes, sir."
edward,You see this young lady over here ?
hollister,Yes.
edward,Do you have anything in this shop as beautiful as she is ?
hollister,"Oh, yes."
hollister,"Oh, no ! No, no, no, I'm saying we have many things as beautiful as she would want them to be. That's the point I was getting at, and I think we can all agree with that. That's why when you came in... Edward takes Hollister's elbow and walks slightly away."
edward,Excuse me. You know what we're gonna need here ?
hollister,...we knew from the first...
edward,We're gonna need a few more people helping us. I'll tell you why. We're going to be spending an obscene amount of money in here. So we're going to need a lot more help sucking up to us. That's what we really like. You understand that.
hollister,"Sir, if I may say so, you're in the right store and the right city for that matter."
hollister,"Anything you see here, we can do, by the way. Get ready to have some fun. Okay ?"
vivian,Okay.
hollister,"Mary Pat, Mary Kate, Mary Francis, Tovah, let's see it !"
hollister,"Come on. Bring it out, girls."
the saleswoman,"Oh, this is absolutely divine."
hollister,"Excuse me, sir, uh,"
edward,Yeah ?
hollister,Exactly how obscene an amount of money were you talking about ? Just profane or really offensive ?
edward,Really offensive.
hollister,I like him so much !
hollister,"Mr. Lewis, sir. Mr. Lewis, how's it going so far ? Pretty well, I think."
edward,I think we need some major sucking up.
hollister,"Very well, sir. You're not only handsome, but a powerful man. I could see the second you walked in here, you were someone to reckon with..."
edward,Hollister.
hollister,"Yes, sir."
edward,Not me. Her.
hollister,"I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry."
hollister,"How we doing, ladies ?"
philip,"Oh, Edward, Edward. Where the hell are you ? The word's all over the street."
edward,"He's countering ?   God, he is a tough old bird."
philip,"I don't know. He, uh... I think he's throwing in with the employees."
edward,He still needs someone to underwrite the paper.
philip,"Yeah, okay. You got it."
edward,You're on your own. I have to go back to work. You look great !
edward,She has my card.
hollister,"And we'll help her use it, sir."
lyrics,Pretty woman walking down the street.
lyrics,Pretty woman the kind I like to meet. Pretty woman.
lyrics,I don't believe you. You're not the truth.
lyrics,No one could look as good as you. Mercy.
vivian,Edward would love that tie.
hollister,Would you give her the tie ?
the salesman,The tie ?
hollister,Take off the tie. Give her the tie.
the salesman,The tie. He starts taking off his tie.
hollister,"He really wants to do this, by the way."
vivian,He would go crazy about this tie.
hollister,Who ordered pizza ?
lyrics,"Pretty woman, stop a while."
lyrics,"Pretty woman, talk a while. Pretty woman give your smile to me."
lyrics,"Pretty woman Yeah, yeah, yeah."
lyrics,"Pretty woman, look my way."
lyrics,"Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me."
vivian,"No, thank you."
vivian,Hi.
vivian,Do you remember me ?
vivian,I was in here yesterday. You wouldn't wait on me.
vivian,"You work on commission, right ?  SALESWOMAN # 1 Uh, yes."
vivian,Big mistake. Big. Huge ! I have to go shopping now.
lyrics,"Pretty woman don't walk on by. The camera moves across the lobby, until it reaches Barney, the managers, talking to two of his employees, one uniformed male and one female. He has not noticed Vivian yet, because she is coming behind him."
lyrics,Pretty woman don't make me cry. Pretty woman.
lyrics,"Don't walk away, hey."
vivian,Wait... Thank you.
lyrics,"Oh, oh, pretty woman."
philip,"Fellas, let's finish this up this afternoon, huh ?"
philip,"Jake, set something up with Blair. Around two o'clock, two- thirty, would be good."
philip,"You were right about Morse. He mortgaged everything he owns, right down to his underwear, to secure a loan from the bank."
philip,"And it's not just any bank. Plymouth Trust, huh ?"
edward,Hmm.
philip,"So, it goes without saying... that your business means a lot more to them than our friend, Mr. Morse. So, all you gotta do is call the bank."
edward,Yeah.
philip,"Edward, excuse me for saying this, but what the hell is wrong with you this week ? Are you giving Morse a chance to get away ?"
edward,"You know what I used to love when I was a kid, Phil ?"
philip,What ?
edward,Blocks. Building blocks. Erector sets.
philip,"So, I liked Monopoly. Boardwalk, Park Place. Wh-What's the point ?"
edward,"We don't build anything, Phil. We don't make anything."
philip,"We make money, Edward. We worked for a year on this deal. It's what you said you wanted. I'm handing it to you."
philip,Morse's jugular is exposed. It's time for the kill. Let's finish this. Call the bank !
vivian,"How was your day, dear ? Edward stops and looks at her."
edward,Nice tie.
vivian,I got it for you.
edward,Then he divorced my mother to be with another woman. And he took his money with him.
edward,"It cost me ten thousands dollars in therapy to say that sentence : I was very angry with him. I do it very well, don't I ? I'll say it again. I was very angry with him."
edward,"Hello, my name is Mr. Lewis. I'm very angry with my father."
vivian,I would've been angry at the ten thousands dollars.
edward,My father was president of the third company I ever took over. I bought it. I sold it off piece by piece.
vivian,What'd the shrink say ?
edward,He said I was cured.
vivian,"Well, so you got even. That must've made you happy."
vivian,"Did I mention my leg is 44 inches from hip to toe, so, basically, we're talking about 88 inches of therapy..."
vivian,...wrapped around you for the bargain price of...
vivian,Yeah.
philip,"Watch where you're walking, because, if you step in something, we're not going back in the car."
philip,Not too near the tree. I don't like the ants.
philip,Hello. Have you seen Edward anywhere ?
vivian,What if someone recognizes me ?
edward,Not likely. They don't spend too much time on Hollywood Boulevard.
vivian,You did.
edward,Come on. Let go. Let go.
edward,All right. You look great. You look like a lady. You're gonna have a wonderful time.
edward,Okay. Don't fidget and smile.
edward,"This is Gwen and Gretchen, the infamous Olsen sisters, who have made marrying well an art form."
gwen,Edward.
edward,Be back in just a second. Hold on.
gwen,"So, you're the flavor of the month. Hmm."
gretchen,"Uh, she's just being testy. Edward's our most eligible bachelor. Everybody is trying to land him."
vivian,"Well, I'm not trying to land him. I'm just using him for sex."
edward,Well done.
vivian,"Well done. Whoo, whoo, whoo !"
vivian,Tell me again why we're here.
edward,Business.
vivian,Business mingling ?
edward,Yeah.
philip,Excuse me. Edward !
philip,Edward. Over here.
edward,Phil.
philip,"Ah, good to see you."
edward,"Me too. I want you to meet a new friend of mine, Vivian Ward."
philip,"Well, hi. Philip Stuckey, Vivian. This is my wife, Elizabeth."
elizabeth,It's always a pleasure meeting one of Edward's girls.
elizabeth,"Oh, my God ! It's Tate Whitley Wallington. She runs after Tate."
elizabeth,"Tate ! It's me, Elizabeth, from Workout World."
philip,"Sort of an aerobics queen. Feel the burns. Well, let me get you something to drink. Vivian, why don't you start with that. Okay ?"
philip,I'll be right back. Did you notice Senator Adams is here ?
edward,Mm-hmm. I asked him.
philip,That is why I have pledged my eternal love to you. Mmm !
vivian,Real genuine guy. Who is he ?
edward,He's my lawyer. He's all right.
vivian,You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.
edward,Maybe we'll try that later.
vivian,Are these people your friends ?
edward,"I spend time with them, yeah."
vivian,"Well, no wonder."
edward,No wonder what ?
vivian,No wonder why you came looking for me.
gwen,And I do need some help from you ladies and gentlemen in the audience.
bearded announcer,"This is a time-honored tradition, ladies and gentlemen."
elizabeth,"She's sweet, Edward."
edward, 976-BABE.
the man,"No, it's all part of the game of polo. You get to have your shoes polished by a member of the club."
the man,I think I got something in the car that will buff that up. He walks away with the shoe.
vivian,Thank you.
david morse,"Vivian, hi. David Morse."
the woman,Excuse me.
vivian,David.
david morse,How are you ?
vivian,I'm okay.
david morse,I thought that was you. I like this hat.
vivian,It's new.
elizabeth,What are you looking at ?
philip,Edward's date.
philip,Uh-huh.
elizabeth,"Philip, I'm going to rip off all my clothes and do a naked belly dance for the polo players."
philip,Have fun.
david morse,"Come meet my horse, Vivian."
vivian,"Well, Edward's waiting for me. I don't want to..."
david morse,Come on. He's right here.
vivian,"Okay, I'll... Just for a second, though."
vivian,I didn't know you were playing today.
edward,Uh... I was asking for directions. There she was.
philip,"Oh, so you just ran into her ? That's great, Jesus !"
philip,"So anyway, what does she do ? Does she... does she work ?"
edward,She's in sales.
philip,Sales ? That's terrific. That's good. What does she sell ?
edward,Why do you want to know ?
philip,"Now just hear me out on this, okay ? I've known you a long time. I... I see some differences in you this week, like the tie, and, uh... I'm wondering if maybe this girl isn't the difference, especially when I see her talking to David Morse."
philip,"I mean, this girl appears from out of nowhere. Now she's talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy. That's a little convenient, don't you think ?"
edward,Don't be ridiculous.
philip,"Edward, how... how do you know that this girl... hasn't attached herself to you because she's bringing information back to Morse ? This happens ! Industrial espionage..."
edward,"Phil, Phil, Phil ! Phil, listen to me."
philip,What ?
edward,She's not a spy. She is a hooker.
philip,Oh !
edward,She is a hooker. I picked her up on Hollywood Boulevard. In your car.
philip,"Oh, you are..."
edward,"Yes, yes."
philip,"Oh, man !"
philip,"You know, you're the only millionaire I ever heard of... who goes looking for a bargain basement streetwalker, you know ?"
edward,I'm sorry I told you.
edward,"Senator. Senator Adams, I'm pleased you could make it."
senator adams,Thank you. I hope the information I gave you was helpful.
edward,"There's no change, is there ?"
senator adams,"No, it's still bogged down."
philip,"Having a nice time, Vivian ?"
vivian,"Yeah, I'm having a great time."
philip,"Must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard, hmm ? She stops smiling and shows a very sad and worried face."
vivian,What ?
philip,"Yeah, Edward told me. But don't worry : you're secret is safe with me. Listen, maybe, uh, you and I could get together sometime..."
philip,...after Edward leaves.
vivian,"Yeah, sure. Why not ?"
philip,"We'll just have to do that, hmm ?"
edward,You all right ?
vivian,I'm fine.
edward,Fine. That's good. Seven fines since we left the match.
edward,"Could I have another word, please ?"
vivian,Asshole ! There's a word.
edward,I think I liked fine better.
vivian,You know what ? Just tell me one thing : Why did you make me get all dressed up ?
edward,"Well, for one thing, the clothing was appropriate."
vivian,"No, what I mean is, if you were gonna tell everybody I'm a hooker, - why didn't you just let me wear my own clothes, okay ?"
edward,I did not... I did not...
vivian,"I mean, in my own clothes, when someone like that guy Stuckey comes up to me, I can handle it, I'm prepared."
edward,I'm very sorry. I'm not happy with Stuckey at all for saying or doing that. But he is my attorney. I've known him for ten years.
edward,He thought you were some kind of an industrial spy. The guy's paranoid.
vivian,"What are you, my pimp now ?"
vivian,"You know, you think you can pass me around to your friends ? I'm not some little toy !"
edward,"Look, you're not my toy, I know you're not my toy."
edward,"Vivian ! Vivian, I'm speaking to you. Come back here !"
edward,"I hate to point out the obvious, but you are, in fact, a hooker ! And you are my employee !"
vivian,"Look, you don't own me. I decide, okay ? I say who. I say when. I... I say who..."
edward,I refuse to spend the next three days fighting with you. I said I was sorry. I meant it. That's the end of it !
vivian,I'm sorry I ever met you. She walks away into the bathroom
vivian,I'm sorry I ever got into your stupid car !
edward,As if you had so many more appealing options.
vivian,I've never had anyone make me feel as cheap as you did today.
edward,"Somehow, I find that very hard to believe. She gets out of the bathroom with her arms full of clothes. She picks up a small handbag and puts it on her shoulder. Then she tries to pick up a larger handbag."
edward,Where are you going ?
vivian,I want my money. I want to get out of here.
vivian,Come on !
edward,I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared to answer questions about us. It was stupid and cruel. I didn't mean it. I don't want you to go. Will you stay the week ?
vivian,Why ?
edward,I saw you talking to David Morse. I didn't like it.
vivian,We were just talking.
edward,I didn't like it.
dennis,Down ?
vivian,You hurt me.
edward,Yes.
vivian,Don't do it again.
vivian,"First guy I ever loved was a total nothing. Second was worse. My mom called me a bum magnet. If there was a bum within a fifty-mile radius, I was completely attracted to him. That's how I ended up here. I followed bum number three. Slowly, the camera moves closer to them."
edward,Mm.
vivian,"So here I was : no money, no friends, no bum."
edward,So then you chose this as your profession ?
vivian,"I worked at a couple fast food places, parked cars at wrestling. And I couldn't make the rent. I was too ashamed to go home. That's when I met Kit. She was a hooker and made it sound so great. So one day I did it."
vivian,"I cried the whole time. But then I got some regulars and, you know... It's not like anybody plans this. It's not your childhood dream."
edward,You could be so much more.
vivian,"People put you down enough, you start to believe it."
edward,"I think you are a very bright, very special woman. Reverse shot on Vivian's face."
vivian,The bad stuff is easier to believe. You ever notice that ?
philip,"No, I don't want to talk to him now. Tell him I'll call him on Monday."
the receptionist,"Yes, sir."
philip,Where are you going ? Did he sign these ?
the secretary,"No, he said he had to leave."
philip,He had to...
philip,"Edward, you can't disappear now. We're in this too deep."
edward,"Don't panic, Philip. Morse isn't going anywhere. I'll be back here in the morning."
edward,Did you send the tickets to the hotel ?
the receptionist,"Yes, sir."
edward,Thank you.
philip,Where are you going ?
edward,I have a date.
philip,With the hooker ?
edward,"Be careful, Philip."
vivian,Do I look okay ?
edward,Mmm.
vivian,Mmm ?
edward,Something's missing.
vivian,"Well, nothing else is gonna fit into this dress. I'll tell you that."
edward,"Well, maybe something in this box. I don't want you to get too excited. This is only on loan."
vivian,Oh !
vivian,They really let you borrow this from the jewelry store ?
edward,I'm a very good customer.
vivian,"If you were gonna buy this, how much would it cost ?"
edward,Quarter of a million.
vivian,A quarter of a million dollars ?
vivian,"So, where are we going ?"
edward,It's a surprise.
vivian,"If I forget to tell you later, I had a really good time tonight."
edward,Thank you.
edward,"When you're not fidgeting, you look very beautiful... and very tall."
lyrics,You're a dream coming true. I can't believe how I have...
lyrics,...fallen for you.
lyrics,You are the one who's led me to the sun.
lyrics,How could I know...
edward,"You don't want to go to San Francisco in a limousine, do you ?"
lyrics,...I was lost without you.
vivian,I've never been on a plane before.
lyrics,And I want to tell you...
lyrics,...you control my brain.
lyrics,And you should know that...
lyrics,...you are life in my veins.
vivian,We're late.
edward,"No, it's all right. Opening night never starts on time."
vivian,Okay.
edward,Thank you.
usher,"Right this way, Mr. Lewis, sir. Vivian enters first, followed by Edward. Vivian looks down from the balustrade of the box. Edward shakes hand with Doris, an old lady in the next box."
edward,Doris.
doris,"Edward, how are you ?"
edward,How nice to see you. Nice to see you.
edward,Sir.
doris' husband,"Good evening, Edward."
edward,Wonderful news. Congratulations.
vivian,"Hey, come here. You gotta look at this."
edward,It's all right. I've already seen it.
vivian,"If you're afraid of heights, why do you get seats up here ?"
edward,Because they're the best.
usher,"Is there anything else, sir ?"
edward,"No, thank you."
usher,The glasses are there. Enjoy the opera.
vivian,Oh !
vivian,"So, you said this is in Italian."
edward,Mm-hmmm.
vivian,So how am I gonna know what they're singing. These are broken.
vivian,Mine are broken.
edward,"No, no. That's okay It's all right."
vivian,Oh.
edward,"You'll know. Believe me, you'll understand."
edward,The music's very powerful.
vivian,There's a band !
edward,"People's reactions to opera the first time they see it is very dramatic. They either love it or they hate it. If they love it, they will always love it. If they don't, they may learn to appreciate it, but it will never become part of their soul."
vivian,Mmm.
doris,"Did you enjoy the opera, dear ?"
vivian,"Oh, it was so good, I almost peed in my pants."
doris,What ?
edward,She said she liked it better than Pirates of Penzance.
doris,"Oh ! Edward walks away, leaving a very pensive Doris. Apparently she doesn't completely believe Edward's translation of Vivian's words !"
edward,Yes. Good-bye now.
vivian,Why don't you not go to work tomorrow. Take the day off.
edward,"Me, not work ?"
vivian,Yeah.
edward,I do own the company.
secretary,"Here are the storage reports you wanted, and Mr. Lewis called."
philip,What'd he say ?
secretary,He said he's taking the day off.
philip,He's taking the day off ?
secretary,That's what he said.
vivian,I'm starving. There's a snap dog vendor over there. Do you have any money ?
edward,"I have money. I don't know what a snap dog is, but I have money."
vivian,"Well, I'm gonna give, um... you'll buy a snap dog. We'll cop a squat under a tree somewhere."
edward,Cop a what ?
vivian,Cop a squat.
edward,"All right, read the first two pages."
edward,Okay... Mmm...
edward,I was talking to someone.
edward,Did you know that two of the Bach pieces that we heard tonight... were found by Felix Mendelssohn in a butcher's shop ? They were wrapping meat with the sheet music.
edward,What's with you ? You're fidgeting. What's wrong ?
vivian,"Um... There's a club up here that I'd like to stop into for a second to see my roommate, if that's okay ?"
edward,Absolutely.
edward,Darryl !
vivian,"Uh, Darryl, can you just pull up into the back alleyway, please ?"
edward,You say this is a nice place. I'm sure it's a very nice place.
vivian,"I just wanna run in for a minute and see if she's there, so just stay here."
vivian,I'm hoping they don't spot this limousine as it is.
edward,I'll block it with my body.
lyrics,Fame makes a man who'll take things over. Fame Lets him loose and hard to swallow.
lyrics,Fame puts you there where things are hollow.
a customer,"Hey, Viv, you looking good, man. What'd you win, the lottery or what ? Vivian walks toward Rachel, one of the dancing girls."
vivian,"Hey, Rachel, have you seen Kit ?"
rachel,"No, not since, uh, Tuesday. Hey, and Carlos is looking for her too."
vivian,"Hi, Pops. Thanks. Have you seen Kit ?"
pops,I think she went to Santa Barbara.
edward,Hi.
vivian,"Here's my number where I'm gonna be for the rest of the week. Have her call me or come by, okay ?"
pops,"Okay, honey. Thanks."
vivian,Thanks.
lyrics,"Fame, what you like is in the limo. Fame."
vivian,What's going on out here ?
edward,I don't know. You left and all of a sudden I'm in the middle of West Side Story.
carlos,"I think you owe me some money, baby.  THE GUY WITH THE STICK Two hundred dollars."
edward,Why don't you go to school tomorrow ?
carlos,Now I hear you got yourself a new job ?
vivian,Let's just leave.
carlos,You ain't going no place.
edward,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey..."
carlos,"You're out of your neighborhood, home boy. This ain't no Beverly Hills !"
edward,I don't believe this. He has this knife coming out of his skateboard. He's going to stab me.
edward,"What are you gonna do, you gonna strangle me with a Slinky ?"
carlos,Shut up !
edward,"All right, okay, this is what's happening. You believe that this person owes you money, right, two hundred dollars ?"
carlos,That's right.
edward,Why ?
carlos,Because this is my block.
edward,His block ?
vivian,"He's a drug dealer. It has to do with Kit. Let's just go, Edward."
carlos,Edward. So how's it feel to be a trick ?
edward,I am not a trick. This is a trick.
edward,Darryl ! Left pocket.
edward,"Isn't that incredible ? And he does have a permit. Thank you, gentlemen."
edward,Don't you ever go near her again.
vivian,He sleeps.
vivian,I love you.
edward,"The fact that this will be our last night together, and you'll finally be rid of me."
vivian,"Well, you've been pretty tough to take."
edward,"My business is almost over, so I'll be going back to New York."
edward,I'd really like to see you again.
vivian,You would ?
edward,"Yes. Yes, I would, so I've arranged for you to have an apartment, to have a car..."
edward,...to have a wide variety of stores guaranteed to suck up to you anytime you want to go shopping. Everything's done.
vivian,What else ? You gonna leave some money by the bed when you pass through town ?
edward,"Vivian, it really wouldn't be like that."
vivian,How would it be ?
edward,"Well, for one thing, it would get you off the streets."
vivian,That's just geography.
edward,What do you see happening between us ?
vivian,"I don't know. When I was a little girl, my mama used to lock me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. And I would... I would pretend I was a princess... trapped in a tower by a wicked queen."
vivian,...on a white horse with these colors flying would come charging up and draw his sword. And I would wave. And he would climb up the tower and rescue me.
vivian,"But never in all the time... that I had this dream did the knight say to me, Come on, baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."
edward,Yes.
philip,I just got off the phone with James Morse. Get this.
edward,What about ?
philip,"Edward, I think we got him. His nuts are on the block. We got him !"
edward,"No, it's no good. If he's really caving in, I don't want to wait until this afternoon. Have Morse meet me downtown this morning. Good-bye."
edward,"I have to go now, but I want you to understand... I heard everything you said. This is all I'm capable of right now. It's a very big step for me."
vivian,I know. It's a really good offer for a girl like me.
edward,"I've never treated you like a prostitute. He looks at her, then walks away toward the front door. Out of his hearing, Vivian whispers :"
vivian,You just did.
barney,"It's Barnard Thompson here, Miss Vivian."
barney,Could you come down to the front desk ? There's someone here who wants to speak to you. She says her name is Miss De Luca...
kit,Let me talk to her. Let me... Let me just talk to her.
kit,"Yo, Viv, babe. Would you come down here ? The sphincter police won't let me through. Okay."
kit,She's on her way.
barney,Fine.
the attendant,Mr. Thompson.
barney,Yes.
the attendant,The window washer is refusing to come down.
barney,"It's a Saturday. Wait here, please.  Watch her."
kit,"Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch."
vivian,"Listen, I've been calling you."
kit,"Yeah, I know. They told me at the Banana you were looking for me."
vivian,You were supposed to come by Tuesday. I left the money at the desk.
kit,I was hiding out from Carlos.
vivian,"Well, if you picked up the money, you wouldn't have to hide."
kit,"Hey, I was busy. I had a life, you know. Nino got beat up. We had to visit him in the hospital. Rachel got arrested. It was a mess. Anyway, I got the money."
kit,Thank you very much for saving my ass. Now Carlos can get off of it.
kit,"You know, he was talking about you last night. He would bust something if he saw you in this outfit."
kit,I was afraid to hug you up there. I might wrinkle you !
kit,You look really good.
kit,"No, something with shade."
kit,"You clean up real nice. You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard looking like you do, not that you ever did."
vivian,"Well, thanks, but it's easy to clean up when you got money."
kit,"Yeah. So, when does he leave ?"
vivian,Tomorrow.
kit,You get to keep the clothes ?
vivian,"Yeah. Edward asked me if I wanted to see him again. But I think... I think definitely no. I mean, it's just another week, right ?"
kit,Definitely no.
vivian,Yeah.
kit,"Oh, no."
vivian,What ?
kit,I know this weepy look on your face.
vivian,"Oh, no, you don't !"
kit,You fell in love with him.
vivian,"No. Kit, please. Stop it."
kit,You've fallen in love with him ?
vivian,Kit !
kit,Did you kiss him ? On the mouth ?
vivian,"Uh, yeah, yeah... I did."
kit,You kissed him on the mouth ?
vivian,I did. It was nice.
kit,"You fall in love with him, and you kiss him on the mouth. Did I not teach you anything ?"
vivian,"Look, I'm not stupid, okay ? I'm... I'm not in love with him. I just... I like him."
kit,You like him ?
vivian,Yeah.
kit,"You definitely like him. Well, he's not a bum. He's a rich, classy guy."
vivian,"Who's gonna break my heart, right ?"
kit,"Oh, no. Come on. You don't know that. Hey, he asked you, right ? Maybe you guys could, like, um, you know, get a house together. Like, buy some diamonds and a horse. I don't know."
kit,"Anyway, it could work. It happens."
vivian,"When does it happen, Kit ? When does it really happen ? Who does it really work out for ? Did it work out for Skinny Marie or Rachel ? No !"
kit,Those were very specific cases of crackheads.
vivian,I just wanna know who it works out for. You give me one example of somebody that we know that it happened for.
kit,Name someone ?
vivian,"Yeah, one person that it worked out for."
kit,You want me to give you a name or something.
vivian,Yeah. I'd like to know.
kit,"Oh, God, the pressure of a name."
kit,Cinder-fucking-rella.
the father,"Winner gets a piggy-back. Come on, saddle up, boy."
philip,"Mr. Morse, you said this morning you wished to speak to Mr. Lewis. Mr. Lewis is now listening."
james morse,"I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer... on one condition. I'm not so concerned about me, but the people who are working for me."
philip,"It's not a problem. They'll be taken care of. Well, then, gentlemen. If we could address ourselves to the contracts in front of you. If you look at..."
edward,"Excuse me, Phil."
edward,"Gentlemen, I'd like to speak to Mr. Morse alone. Thank you."
philip,"All right, gentlemen, you heard the man. Please wait outside. All the assistants stand up to leave the room."
edward,"You too, Phil."
philip,What do you mean ?
edward,I mean I would like to speak to Mr. Morse alone.
philip,Why does he get to stay ?
edward,"Please, please."
philip,I'll be right outside.
edward,Good.
edward,Is that better ?
james morse,It's all right.
edward,Would you like a cup of coffee ?
james morse,Black.
edward,"Mr. Morse, my interests in your company have changed."
james morse,"What is it you're after now, Mr. Lewis ?"
edward,"Well, I no longer wish to buy your company and take it apart. But I don't want anyone else to, either. And it is still extremely vulnerable. So I find myself... in unfamiliar territory. I want to help you."
james morse,Why ?
edward,"Mr. Morse, I think we can do something very special with your company."
james morse,What about our Navy contracts ?
edward,"Ah, they weren't dead. Just delayed. I... bluffed a little bit."
james morse,You're very good at it.
edward,Thank you very much. It's my job.
edward,I think we can leave the details up to the others.
james morse,"I find this hard to say without sounding condescending, but... I'm proud of you."
edward,Thank you. I think we can let in the other suits now.
edward,Let's continue the meeting.
james morse,"Come in, gentlemen. Sit down."
philip,"Edward, please, what was this all about ? Hmm ?"
edward,"It's all yours, Phil. Finish it up."
james morse,Great big ships.
edward,"You know, I think I'm gonna go for a walk. Just stay here for a while. I'll be back."
darryl,"Yes, sir, Mr. Lewis."
philip,"Well, well. Hello again. I'm looking for Edward."
vivian,Edward's not here. I thought he was with you.
philip,"No. Uh, Edward is definitely not with me."
philip,"No, if Edward were with me..."
philip,"When. Actually, when... Edward was with me, he didn't blow off billion dollar deals !"
philip,"I think that, uh, Edward's with you. That's what I think. Mind if I have a drink ?"
vivian,No.
vivian,"No, thank you."
philip,"Well, I'll just wait."
vivian,"Uh, Edward will be back soon. Any minute, he'll be home."
philip,"You know...   ...this is not home. This is, uh, a hotel room. And, uh, you are not... the little woman."
philip,"You're a hooker. Maybe you're a very good hooker, you know ? She puts her notebook on the low table."
philip,"Maybe if I do you, then I wouldn't care about losing millions of dollars. Because I have to be very honest with you right now, Vivian."
philip,"Right now I really do care. I really do. And right now I am really pissed, you know ?"
philip,"Right now I am just freaking out. So maybe if I screw you, huh..."
philip,"...and take you to the opera, then I could be a happy guy, just like Edward."
vivian,"Hey, get off me !"
philip,"Hey, hey ! Goddamn it !"
philip,Ow !
vivian,Ow !
philip,Come on ! Come on ! I'll pay for it.
philip,"How much is it ? Twenty bucks, thirty bucks ?"
philip,"Fifty ? You a fifty dollars whore, Vivian ?"
philip,What are you doing ? Get off !
edward,Stop. I don't want to hurt you ! Stop it !
philip,"I don't know how to tell you this. You already did, Edward !"
philip,"All right, all right."
edward,Out. Out of here.
philip,"Look, she's a whore, man. She's a goddamn... Aah !"
edward,Aah ! Damn. Shit. Goddamn !
philip,I think you broke my nose.
edward,Get out of here.
edward,"That's bullshit. This is such bullshit ! It's the kill you love, not me ! I made you a very rich man doing exactly what you loved. Now get out of here !"
vivian,Wham ! And it feels like your eye is gonna explode. What do they do ? Do they pull you aside in high school and show you how to do this ?
vivian,Is that... Ow ! Even the light touch of the napkin seems to hurt her.
edward,Not all guys hit.
vivian,I heard about what you did with Morse.
edward,That was a business decision.
vivian,It was good.
edward,It felt good.
vivian,I think this is okay.
vivian,I gotta get going.
edward,"Yes, I noticed you're packed. Why are you leaving now ?"
vivian,"Edward, there'll always be some guy, even some friend of yours, thinking he can treat me like Stuckey, thinking that it's allowed. What are you gonna do ? You gonna beat up everybody ?"
edward,That's not why you're leaving.
vivian,"Look, you made me a really nice offer. And a few months ago, no problem. But now everything is different, and you've changed that. And you can't change back. I want more."
edward,I know about wanting more. I invented the concept. The question is how much more.
vivian,I want the fairy tale.
edward,Impossible relationships.
edward,My special gift is impossible relationships.
edward,Thank you.
vivian,You're welcome. She puts the money in the pocket of her jacket. He is holding a business card in his hand.
vivian,I had a good time.
edward,Me too.
edward,Do you want me to get you a bellboy ?
vivian,"No, I got it."
edward,I'll carry this.
vivian,Thanks.
edward,"Stay. Stay the night with me. And not because I'm paying you, but because you want to."
vivian,I can't.
edward,Good-bye.
vivian,I think you have a lot of special gifts.
edward,Mmm.
the attendant,"I didn't do it, sir."
barney,"No, no. Now, I didn't say that. I want you to call maintenance and have them deal with this. You must delegate authority."
the attendant,"Yes, sir."
vivian,"Hi, Barney."
barney,Miss Vivian.
barney,Thank you.
vivian,I wanted to say good-bye.
barney,"Well, then, I gather you're not accompanying Mr. Lewis to New York."
vivian,"Come on, Barney. You and me live in the real world... most of the time."
barney,Have you arranged for transportation ?
vivian,I'm gonna call a cab.
barney,Allow me.
barney,"Darryl. DARRYL  Yes, sir."
barney,Please take Miss Vivian anywhere she wishes to go.
darryl,"Yes, sir."
barney,It's been a pleasure knowing you. Come and visit us again sometime.
vivian,Stay cool.
lyrics,Lay a whisper On my pillow. Leave the winter On the ground.
lyrics,I wake up lonely...
lyrics,...The stare of silence In the bedroom And all around. Touch me now.
lyrics,I close my eyes And dream away.
lyrics,"It must have been love, But it's over now. It must have been good..."
lyrics,"...But I lost it somehow. It must have been love, But it's over now."
lyrics,"From the moment we touched, Till the time had run out."
bell boy,"Is that everything, sir ?"
edward,"Yes. Yes, that's everything."
bell boy,"I'll meet you downstairs, sir."
edward,Thank you.
kit,We look so dopey.
kit,"San Francisco's not that great, you know."
kit,It's bad climate. It's foggy. It's unpredictable.
vivian,I'll wear a sweater.
kit,What are you gonna do there ?
vivian,Get a job. Finish high school. I got things I can do. I used to make pretty good grades in high school.
kit,"Yeah, I could see that about you. I could see that."
vivian,Sure you won't come with me ?
kit,And leave all this ? Not in a million.
vivian,Come here.
kit,Whoa. Whoa. What is this ?
vivian,"It's part of the Edward Lewis scholarship fund. We think you got a lot of potential, Kit De Luca."
kit,You do ? You think I got potential ?
vivian,"Oh, yeah. Don't let anybody tell you different, okay ?"
kit,Okay.
vivian,Take care of you.
kit,"No, I can't, I can't. It's your favorite."
kit,What time's your bus ?
vivian,An hour.
kit,"Yeah, well, I gotta split, 'cause good-byes make me crazy. So, take care of you."
vivian,"Whoa. Vivian slaps Kit's back, and then kisses her on the head."
barney,Mr. Lewis.
edward,"You don't have any messages for me, do you ?"
barney,"No, I'm afraid not, sir."
edward,I'll need a car to the airport also.
barney,Of course. Darryl will take you wherever you need to go.
barney,"Darryl, the limousine out front, please ?"
darryl,"Yes, sir."
barney,"Thank you, Darryl."
edward,One last thing.
barney,Yes.
edward,"If you could possibly return this to Fred's for me, please."
barney,"Yes, of course. May I, sir ?"
edward,"Of course, please. Barney opens the jewel box."
barney,It must be difficult to let go of something so beautiful.
barney,"You know, Darryl also drove Miss Vivian home yesterday."
barney,I'll take care of it.
edward,"Thank you, Mr. Thompson."
kit,"I'm gonna have to charge you a little more rent than Vivian... because I've got this beauty course I'm looking into. I'm not gonna be there that much, you know ?"
kit,'Cause you can't... You just can't turn tricks forever. You gotta have a goal. Do you have a goal ?
the florist,"Help you, love ? Edward points to a bunch of flowers. The florist gives it to him."
edward,There you go. Thank you very much.
kit,"So, you got a lot of stuff you gotta move in ?"
angel,"No, Carlos burned most of my stuff when I said I was moving out."
edward,Vivian !
edward,Vivian !
edward,"Had to be the top floor, right ?"
edward,All right. I'm coming up.
edward,So what happened after he climbed up the tower and rescued her ?
vivian,She rescues him right back.
lyrics,"Pretty woman, Walking down the street. Pretty woman, The kind I like to meet. Pretty woman, I don't believe you. You're not the truth. No one could look as good as you. Mercy. Pretty woman won't you pardon me. Pretty woman I couldn't help but see, Pretty woman, That you look lovely as can be. Are you lonely just like me. Oh, pretty woman."
lyrics,"You really took me by surprise. You're someone I've needed for a lifetime. Your heart was cleverly disguised, And it didn't look that way in my mind. Tell me how could it be. I was the last to know. Darling, I couldn't read what was in your mind, To turn around and love me, With no Explanation. I gave you everything I have. I didn't know that you would take it With sweet consideration. And after all that we've been through, I can't believe it's true Until I hear you say. Ooh ! I know now, now, now. Ah ! No explanation. I gave you everything I have. I didn't know that you would take it."
