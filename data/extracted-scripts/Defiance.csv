Speaker,Dialogue
elderly man,"Fine, fine..."
elderly man,...You. Can it be? The eyes in the mirror look away. And then back.
asael,Where are they taking them?
zus,--Shveig! Shveig!
zus,Just shut up! Please...
asael, Some food...?
walencki,They are looking for you people. The two brothers glance nervously around.
asael,"Zus. Let's go. As they retreat toward the woods, Zus warns the farmer."
zus,We'll be back.
tuvia,And no news of my brothers?
rifka,"They are used to trouble, they'll be all right."
tuvia,"If you stay, you'll have to go to the ghetto."
rifka,"I can get false papers and pass as a gentile. So can you. Tuvia shakes his head, no. He finishes dressing. Theirs is a relationship long past passion."
tuvia,I need to see to my family. Will you come?
rifka,To the country? No.
asael,Papa-- Gottenyu... Flies buzz about dead LIVESTOCK. A WOMAN'S BODY lies nearby.
asael,Aron. The boy  recoils. He is disoriented and WILL NOT
zus,Stop it... But Asael is lost in a confusion of grief and panic.
tuvia,If I was a German you are dead.
asael,Tuvia! Asael leaps up to embrace him as if he were salvation itself.
zus,Big brother returns. Tuvia and Zus look at each other warily.
asael,Are you going back to the army?
tuvia,There is no more army. Asael worships his big brother.
zus,Hope at least you killed a few. Tuvia just stares at him.
asael,What is it like? To be in a war?
tuvia,It wasn't war. It was something else. Zus eyes him carefully.
zus,Horodysze. Hiding in a cellar. I'll bring her when it is safe. Where is Rifka?
tuvia,In Novgrudok. She wouldn't leave.
zus,You are still separated?
tuvia,She is still my wife.
zus,Your rich wife. Zus chews with the open-mouthed relish of a peasant.
tuvia,No. Do you?
tuvia,Is there anything left to eat? Only a few potatoes in Asael's bag. WORMS writhe among them.
asael,"Zus finished the last of the sausage. Tuvia glares at Zus, who glares back. Sibling rivals."
zus,Stankowicz' farm is closest.
asael,He has dogs.
zus,Fuck the dogs. Wilencki then.
tuvia,You think Wilencki is going to give us food?
zus,No. We take it.
tuvia,How?
zus,We...Take...It.
tuvia,And he tells the police.
zus,I have run from the police my whole life. Do you really think it's a good time to stop? A moment of decision. Who holds the balance of power?
asael,We know these woods. They'll never find us in here. Tuvia looks at his brothers. He has been outvoted.
zus, We want food. Be quick about it!
walencki, You again!
walencki,"Sure, sure. Take what you want... Tuvia begins to stuff provisions into a sack."
zus,"Where is your gun, farmer?"
walencki,I have no gun. Zus grabs a dinner plate and SMASHES IT IN THE FARMER'S
walencki,Please... Zus kicks him.
zus,He's lying. He kicks him again. The farmer begins to weep.
walencki,"Up there... Zus kicks the man aside. Above the stove is an old rifle. Zus grabs it, points it at the farmer."
zus,We were never here.
tuvia,He was willing to help us.
zus,He's lucky I didn't crush his head.
tuvia,This is your plan? To terrorize every anti-Semite in Belorussia?
zus,No. Some I will kill.
zus,Ah...
asael,"You know what Papa would do when you did that at table... Tuvia smacks Zus on the head, taking on a gruff voice."
tuvia,Peasant.
asael,I can't believe Papa's dead.
zus,Bernicki.
asael,The police captain?
tuvia,We don't know he did it.
zus,He always had it in for Papa.
tuvia,We don't know he did it.
zus,So we will go and ask him if he did.
asael,Koscik has a pistol. He showed it to me once.
zus,One pistol isn't enough. We need rifles. Machine guns.
tuvia,Machine guns? You're going to take on the whole German army?
zus,"Just because you didn't... The SOUND of footsteps. Zus jumps up cocking the rifle. ARON emerges from the trees. And then, behind him, THE SURVIVORS he discovered among the corpses. THE MIDDLE-AGED MAN holds a teenage GIRL by one hand and carries his younger daughter."
tuvia,Set her down. The man lowers the child to the ground. She isn't moving.
asael,Where did you find them? Aron still won't speak. Asael addresses the other girl.
tuvia,I'll go ask Koscik for food.
zus,And the pistol.
tuvia,"And the pistol. Without another word, he starts off."
zus,Remember to say please.
koscik,I have only four bullets.
tuvia,"I cannot thank you enough. They sit in Koscik's warmly-lit kitchen. Koscik's WIFE stands silently by the stove, glaring at Tuvia."
koscik,Your father was a good man.
tuvia,He said the same of you. Tuvia can't help but notice Koscik's wife giving him the evil eye. Koscik produces a bottle of vodka.
koscik,Ignore the bitch.  Bitch-- Do you want vodka? His wife just glares at him.
koscik,"Working late, boys."
police captain,Hunting Jews. Our new bosses are very organized. Koscik offers the bottle.
koscik,Hunting can work up a thirst.
police captain,Fifteen in one day. The council is offering a year's free tax for every one you turn in. -
koscik,A Jew is worth that much? Do you pay more for a fat one? They laugh appreciatively.
police captain,Caught five of them hiding in a ditch. Smelled so bad I was afraid the Germans wouldn't want them.
koscik,Maybe for a reduced price. More laughter. More vodka.
police captain,You know the Bielski's?
koscik,Sure.
police captain,We missed two when we visited the parents.
police captain,"Anybody caught helping them is in for it. You know this, Koscik?"
koscik,Do I look like an idiot? Don't answer so quickly... More laughter. The Police Captain looks at his watch. Yawns.
police captain,Been at it since dawn. The wife doesn't like these long nights. He tries to hand back the bottle to Koscik.
koscik,Keep it.
police captain,Bribing an officer of the law? Maybe you have more of this black market vodka hidden in the barn?
koscik,Take a look. And clean out the cow shit while you're back there. The policeman laughs and climbs back into the car.
police captain,"You'll keep your eyes open, yes?"
koscik,Good hunting.
koscik,"--If the laborers find them tomorrow, I will be denounced--"
tuvia,What am I supposed to do with--
koscik,Take them into the forest--
tuvia,"--And feed them how? I can't care for my own family. Behind them, several of the REFUGEES have emerged from their hiding place. They stare at Tuvia balefully."
tuvia,Those men? They were the ones who killed my parents?
koscik,You people. Why is it so fucking hard to be friends with a Jew? They embrace.
tuvia,Imagine being one. Tuvia leads his motley band toward the woods.
old man,You sat in back. Tuvia just looks at him.
tuvia,I thought you were dead.
shimon,I am at least half-dead.  I heard them speaking of your parents. I am very sorry. Tuvia shakes his head.
tuvia,Zus. He's with the other two.
shimon,You are hiding here? In the forest? Tuvia nods.
tuvia,"For a dumb schoolboy, you mean."
shimon,"My whole life I presumed to teach others the right way to live. I had no doubt: this is God's way, this isn't. You'll forgive me if recent events have somewhat shaken my resolve."
tuvia,"It is just like school, I don't know what you're talking about.  Teacher...Come... Come. (gesturing to the"
shimon,Here... You're not hungry? Aron doesn't respond.
asael,He saw. Things.
zus,I send you for food and you bring more mouths to feed.
tuvia,You send me?
zus,Did you at least get the gun?
tuvia,Only four bullets.
zus,Then we'll have to make them count. Zus heads for the food. Asael is trying to start a fire but the kindling is wet.
shimon,"Here... Shimon takes a book from his coat, rips out pages covered in Hebrew and crumples them into the fire. They burst into flame."
wife,"You worked late. The man nods, his mouth full of food."
police captain, ...Fucking SS never sleeps... The door OPENS slowly. They all look up.
tuvia,You know who I am? The policeman says nothing. His wife is instantly terrified. One of the SONS stands. Tuvia turns the gun on him.
police captain,...what are you talking about?
tuvia,You have no idea what I'm talking about...
police captain,"If they say find someone, I find him. It's my job."
tuvia,To find Jews.
police captain,Or lose my job.
tuvia,"And it's a good job, isn't it? You like your job."
policeman,I was always fair with your family. ...Everyone knew you were smuggling this and that. But I looked the other way.  ...Ask your father.
tuvia,My father? You don't talk about my father... Tuvia places the pistol against the man's forehead.
police captain,"Please.... I beg you... One of the man's SONS makes a move toward Tuvia. Tuvia SHOOTS him in the chest. His mother SCREAMS. The Policeman suddenly starts to stand. Tuvia backs away, shoots him. And then the other son. It is all over in seconds."
wife,"Kill me, too! Tuvia should indeed kill her, too. To avoid being identified."
tuvia,Tell them who did this.
tuvia,"Riboynoy shel oylam, riboynoy shel oylam...  Lord of the universe, forgive me, I have murdered -- but they were monsters and did not deserve to live."
zus,Only one bullet left.
tuvia,His sons. Zus nods his approval.
zus,How was it?
tuvia,What?
zus,"To kill them. It was good, no?"
tuvia,Shut up. Tuvia stares into the fire. He is dirty and tired. Zus looks around.
zus,What are we going to do with these others?
tuvia,I don't know--
zus,The women will slow us down. And your old teacher--
tuvia,You're afraid he's going to beat you for forgetting your homework.
zus,"We have to be able to keep moving, and quickly."
tuvia,I agree. But they're here. They consider their predicament.
zus,Alright. But no more.
tuvia,No more.
tuvia,"I know. I know... Tamara, you remember Cousin Zus. Please, go sit down by the fire. And this is Lazar -- Isabel's youngest... Tamara is pleasant-looking but emotionally wounded."
zus,"Tuvia, I have pity for them all,"
tuvia,They are family.
zus,And how will we feed this family?
tuvia,We'll water the soup. One of the new arrivals is a DARK-HAIRED BEAUTY. Tuvia and Zus watch her pass. Zus is particularly interested.
zus,"And this one, is she family?"
tuvia,"No. By the fire, the veterans pepper the newcomers with"
miriam,You are from Lida! Is Isadore Korein alive?
lova,"There are so many in the ghetto, I don't know..."
tamara,Does anyone have news from Vilna?
tuvia,Fuck me! Have you never used a hammer?
malbin,Uh. No.
tuvia,"What is it you do, then?"
malbin,I suppose...you'd have to say...I was...am...an intellectual.
tuvia,This is a job?
malbin,"I published a small magazine... actually a journal...well, more like a pamphlet. Zus passes them, his arm around the dark-haired beauty."
zus,"Tuvia, this is Rona. Rona is my forest wife."
tuvia,I see. Congratulations. Zus winks and walks past. Malbin and Tuvia watch them.
malbin,Interesting concept.
tuvia,As long as his village wife stays in hiding.
malbin,Nice to know there are some things even Hitler can't destroy.
zus,"Hello, boys, what can we do for you?"
zus,These little shits are holding us up. The Young Man motions his partner to take Zus's rifle.
tuvia,This is all the food we have. You are welcome to share.
zus,No.
zus,"No. We're the Gestapo, you little shit."
tuvia,Come. Sit. Put down your guns.
zus,Or perhaps you'd prefer I shove them up your ass.
tuvia,"Where are you from? The young man glares at Zus. Then, to Tuvia:"
peretz,"We haven't eaten in two days. My name is Peretz, this is Jacov."
jacov,"Two days ago there were three thousand Jews in Horodyszcze. Now there are fifty. Me and him, we hid in a wall."
zus,"You know a woman there, Sonia Bielski? The men look at one another."
jacov,We knew her. Zus can hardly bring himself to ask the next question.
zus,...There was a child. Jacov shakes his head. Sorry. Zus leans his head against a tree. After a moment he begins to BEAT HIS HEAD against it until BLOOD pours down his face.
asael, His family. Tuvia puts his arms around his brother. Zus's shoulders begin to heave. Soon his body convulses with deep wracking sobs. He is absolutely unself-conscious in his grief.
zus,So many dead.
tuvia,I know.
zus,"Mama. Papa. Their heads are close together, their faces wet with tears."
tuvia,I don't know.
zus,I thought they'd be safe. I should have been with them.
tuvia,No.
zus,"I could have protected them. Tuvia just holds him. He, too, is crying quietly."
peretz,We are looking for partisans.
jacov,What is the name of your otriad? Tuvia laughs ruefully.
asael,What is an 'otriad?'
tuvia,An armed brigade.
jacov,We heard the Russians are beginning to organize.
tuvia,Here?
jacov,And also in the Lipicanska.
asael,Then we are the Bielski Otriad. You want to join?
peretz, The Russians are fighters.
jacov,--But you need a gun to join them. Without a gun you are nothing. They sabotage railroads and kill Germans.
tuvia,--we must get what we need without killing. We can't make more enemies-- Zus concentrates on opening the breach.
zus,Blood for blood. You had your revenge.
tuvia,And I can still see their faces.
zus,'Vengeance is mine.' Who said that?
tuvia,"So this is God's work you're doing, Zussie?"
zus,"No. Only YOU can play God. Save a few lives, take a few others..."
tuvia,We cannot become...like them.
zus,If only...  Are you coming with us or not?
tuvia,Us?
zus,Peretz and Jacov.
tuvia, You are making the decisions now? A stand-off. Zus stares back at him. The struggle for command has grown more obvious.
man,"My truck! WHO DID THIS TO MY TRUCK? Tuvia, Zus and the others appear out the shadows."
tuvia,We did.
man,Who are you?
peretz,Look--! MORE HEADLIGHTS fast approaching.
tuvia,"Hide! Everyone! They all scramble back into the ditch, dragging the dead courier with them."
private," It's one of ours, but no one is here. Maybe he was drunk? From the car, an SERGEANT yells a reply."
sergeant," Move it off the road before the convoy passes. I'll report the sonuvabitch. As the soldier drags the bike off the road, AN OFFICER steps out of the car and lights a cigarette. He's followed by the Sergeant. He carries a Schmeisser SUBMACHINE GUN dangling from his shoulder."
jacov,I got him! Peretz and Asael can now catch up to the soldier.
tuvia,Stupid! The gunfire could be heard for miles.
zus,"He was pissing on my head. Zus is high from the killing, covered in the dead man's blood. He begins calling out orders."
tuvia,Hurry--!
jacov,They were on their way to a party! They toss one bottle to Zus and another to Tuvia.
zus,"Welcome to Belarus, herr Henkel. A CHAMPAGNE CORK POPS as Peretz and Jacov toast their victory."
peretz,Now we are real Partisans...
jacov,To the Bielski Otriad!
tuvia,"Into the fields! RUN! Tuvia pulls Peretz off the road, but Jacov reloads his rifle and begins to FIRE at the approaching trucks."
tuvia,Zus. His rifle. Zus races back to pick up Peretz's weapon.
tuvia,"Asael... He rips the rifle from Zus's hands. For a moment we think he's going to go back after him. Instead, he wedges the rifle into a tree-trunk and takes careful aim..."
shimon,They thought you were bringing food. Tuvia just stares at him.
tuvia,No.
shimon,"I don't understand. Tuvia says nothing. Nearby, a child cries in hunger."
tuvia,"Again I have no idea what you are talking about. Around them, the beseeching eyes of so many hungry faces."
shimon,I think you do.
voice,"You are the Bielski's? A MAN stands in the clearing. BEN ZION GULKOWITZ is tall, well muscled, a rifle strapped over his shoulder."
zus,How'd you get past the Lazar?
ben zion,"Who? Zus stands unsteadily, then lurches into the woods, leaning on an occasional tree for support. He finds the erstwhile sentry --LAZAR -- ambling toward him."
zus,"You shit! You worthless shit! Zus punches him, knocking him the ground. In a sloppy, drunken frenzy, Zus SLAPS him again."
tuvia,Enough!
zus,He walked right by you! Someone could have been killed! Tuvia pulls Zus off him.
tuvia,"I said, enough!  Get up! Get up!"
zus,If we were real partisans he'd be shot.
tuvia,He made a mistake!
zus,"MISTAKE! We cannot make mistakes! As Zus goes for Lazar again, Tuvia roughly PULLS HIM OFF. Zus goes flying, tripping over, landing on his ass."
tuvia,"That's right, Zus. No mistakes. Like last night.  First they will torture Asael...and then they will hang him. Tuvia walks away, leaving his brother on the ground."
ben zion,You are Tuvia Bielski.
tuvia,You know me?
ben zion,I am Ben Zion Gulkowitz. Ben Zion is besieged by questions about friends and family.
miriam,"Pardon me, you are from Vilna. My sister lives on Passaya Street."
ben zion,The SD came without warning. Hundreds were taken. No one knows where.
miriam,"My poor sister...dear God, no... Meanwhile, Peretz's MOANING ceases. A woman grumbles:"
tamara,At least here we are safe.
lova,There at least we had hope...
shimon,"No. Here, we have hope. A FEW MORE join in, grumbling their dissatisfaction. Others take the opposite position. These are Jews, after all, and arguing is a revered sport and a pastime. It escalates."
tuvia,I know we have no food. But tomorrow... tomorrow will be another mission.
rona,Look what happened the last time.
tuvia,That was a mistake! But the mistakes we made will not be made again! More objections. Tuvia must raise his voice to be heard.
lova,How?
tuvia,Better security. Better at getting food and information-- (talking over their
aron,Or Asael. Everyone stares. It is the first time Aron has spoken.
tuvia,Or Asael. We... We-- (trying to hold it
lova,The poorest farmer has more than us.
tuvia,"True. But what I am saying is... what I mean is... We are not thieves.  We have all chosen this -- to live free, like human beings, for as long as we can. Each day of freedom is an act of faith. And if we die trying to live, at least we die like human beings. His mission statement. A vision of their future. Everyone nods in mute acknowledgement. Zus lowers his head. The shift in power between them has occurred. Tuvia has emerged as the undisputed leader."
tuvia,"Now. They leave their cover and approach warily, guns at the ready."
tuvia,Hello. She refuses to be flattered. In Russian:
koscik's wife,In the barn.
zus,"Koscik, put your pants back on and leave those sheep alone. He steps into the shadows to find:"
tuvia,I'm sorry.
koscik's wife, Come.
tuvia,Thank God.
asael,Zus.... ZUSSIE... I can't breathe. Zus lets him go and Asael reaches back into the root cellar.
zus,"Asael... Well, well.."
tuvia,Thank you.
koscik's wife, Go.
bella,"--and then we fell into this horrible bog. Chaya saved me. Honestly, I can't swim at all."
bella,We must have got lost a dozen times. I was absolutely resigned to die.
zus,No...
bella,"Tell him, Chaya. Was it not the absolute worst? And that farmer, Mr. Koscik, kept making the most vulgar jokes, he said any girl who-- As they continue out of earshot, it appears as though Zus would be happy to listen for hours."
malbin,You're trying to tell me all politics is meaningless.
shimon,"In the West a monster with a little mustache, in the East a monster with a big mustache. This is all I need to know about politics."
malbin,"Your messiah will have a mustache, too, and a full beard."
shimon,"No. The messiahs are all in politics, and they're killing us. Zus unloads two cut and stripped trees."
zus,What's killing me is all your talking. Back to work. Malbin and Shimon go back to work.
malbin,And Roosevelt? He has no mustache.
shimon,"My life in these woods is much easier because of Mr. Roosevelt, thank you."
tuvia,"We need to know what's going on in the villages, how the Germans patrol, who the informers are-- He realizes that Asael is not fully concentrating; instead he is watching as Chaya walks past."
asael,Yes.
tuvia,What's her name?
asael,Chaya. [I believe.]
asael,I hardly know her.
tuvia,"You spent three days in a cellar! Asael blushes, returns the focus to their prior conversation."
asael,Malbin says the Piznarksi granary is full. We need two guns at least...
tuvia,Whose turn to go?
asael,Zus.
tuvia,"You go along, just to make sure he understands my orders. Asael nods."
ben zion,This is not a gun. It is Bar Kochba's spear. It is Ehud's sword. You fix the patch to the rod-- They do as he instructs.
lazar,"I lost my patch. ARKADY LUBCZANSKI whispers contemptuously to his brother,"
arkady lubczanski,"The village idiot. Zus shoves Arkady out of the way and approaches Lazar, who cowers. But rather than abuse him, Zus removes the patch from the rifle and hands it back to him."
lazar,"Thank you, Zus."
zus, It's nothing.
zus," Good morning, friend. Getting an early start to market? Could you possibly spare us a bit of milk? Zus' tone is belied by the rifle in his hand."
kissely,This is what I'm required to give the Germans. If I don't meet my quota they'll shoot me and my family. Zus is tempted to shoot him himself.
asael, Leave half. He can't go to the Germans empty-handed. Zus glares at Asael.
zus," We are so grateful, comrade, for your cooperation. What a lovely coat. Is that a fur collar?"
zus,"Lazar, you can see it's us, you idiot. You only ask, 'who goes there' when you don't know who it is."
lazar,"Sorry, Zus."
malbin,Even Spinoza said existence can be substantiated by empirical evidence.
shimon,"All your secular learning, yet you know nothing of life."
malbin,How can you say this? Learning is my life.
shimon,"And for every fact that goes in your head, another comes out your rear end. CHAYA and BELLA receive the bounty from the foragers."
bella,"Milk, eggs -- Chaya, our brave men have brought us a feast!"
zus,Blintzes! You will make me blintzes! She bestows her best smile upon him.
arkady,I don't think we've been properly introduced. Arkady Lubczanski.
chaya,Hello.
arkady,You are Chaya?
chaya,...Yes.
arkady,You are getting along all right? Anything you need? An extra blanket?
chaya,"Oh. Well... Yes, that would be nice."
arkady,You'll have it by tonight. Something nice and soft.  I couldn't help but notice you don't have a husband yet.
chaya, Yet?
arkady,Most of the woman have already chosen. They haven't told you about this?
chaya,No. But thank you for explaining it. She hurries away. Malbin sits down wearily beside Shimon.
malbin,Descartes at least provided for the subjective nature of experience. He takes a spoon from his sock.
shimon,Yes. You annoy me therefore I exist.
malbin,You are not eating?
shimon,"By my best calculation, today is High Holiday. I am fasting. Malbin can't believe this. He rolls his eyes and digs in. One of the NEWCOMERS has brought a violin. He begins to play. A bittersweet melody. People stop talking and listen, eyes filling at this reminder of a sweeter, civilized time. Ben Zion has left the new arrivals and approached Tuvia. He looks grave. Tuvia immediately knows something is wrong."
tuvia,What is it?
ben zion,"The new ones, they are from Novagroduk. Your wife-- Tuvia tenses. Ben Zion hesitates..."
tuvia,Thank you for telling me.  We have to dig a trench around the new zemylanka. If it rains I'm afraid water will seep in. Tuvia clearly cannot deal with his news.
ben zion,"I'll see to it, then."
aron,"Jacob's ladders. Like in his dream. Asael says you can see the angels. They walk on, eventually coming upon RAILROAD TRACKS. A TRAIN is rounding the bend, headed in their direction."
rachel,Can we stay to watch?
aron,If we hide. They move back into the trees as the train NEARS: a slow- moving engine pulling a line of WOODEN CATTLE CARS.
rachel,Is that a Nazi train?
aron,If we had some dynamite we could blow the shit out of it.
rachel,(with undisguised
shimon,I am sorry for your loss. Tuvia nods. He is deep inside himself.
tuvia,She was a beautiful woman. But cold. Not a day went by she didn't remind me I wasn't a good provider. For years it wasn't really a marriage at all. And now... He lowers his head. All Shimon can do is sit beside him.
bella,"You have lipstick? Please, I know you have some left. Chaya digs in her pocket and produces a tiny remnant. Bella dabs it on and casually approaches Zus, who is on guard duty."
zus,Of course.
bella,You get lonely out here?
zus,I like the woods. LAUGHTER and MUSIC waft through the trees.
bella,I'm a little scared out here. Zus knows an opportunity when he sees one. He offers her a drink from his bottle of vodka.
zus,"Go ahead. She drinks, refuses to grimace. Drinks again. Zus laughs. - Bella touches the rifle in his arms."
bella,Why is there a rule against women having guns?
zus,There aren't enough for the men.
bella,"Women need guns, too."
zus,What for?
bella,For protection.
zus,Women have men for protection. Bella bites her lip. She's a virgin but also realistic.
bella,I want protection. She steps closer and takes Zus's hand...under her coat...onto her breast...never taking her eyes off him.
asael,Don't panic. THIS WAY!. GO.
tuvia,"Lova, Ben Zion -- stay with us. Asael, keep them moving. Don't stop! THE POLICEMEN enter the camp. A submachine gun RAKES a shelter. KISSELY has found the escape trail into the woods."
kissely,This way--
tuvia,"Go! Go! Move!  Isaac, keep them moving! Zus, Asael, Ben Zion... Tuvia motions for them to take defensive positions while the others escape.- The policemen emerge hurriedly through the trees and begin crossing the river. SHOTS rings out. A Policeman goes down. The German Soldier is shot in the leg. They are dragged from the water."
policeman,"Give us Bielski and the rest of you can go free! Behind a tree, Tuvia is surprised by the mention of his name."
tuvia,"You are from Belarussia, pig! Why do you work for the Germans against your own people?"
kissely,For the same reason you steal from the poor. To survive. ANOTHER SHOT RINGS OUT. Kessely is hit in the arm.
zus,Next one is to the head!
tuvia,Soon it will be dark... See how you find your way home then! The policemen are having similar thoughts.
zus,Next time just draw them a map.
tuvia,What does that mean?
zus,"It means -- we should have killed the fucking milkman. Your policy of diplomacy is shit. Zus is breathing hard, full of the adrenaline of battle."
malbin,Where is he taking us? My feet are going to fall off.
shimon,"A great rabbi once said, ""wherever I go, I am always going to the land of Israel."""
malbin,"Well, maybe rabbis should give better directions. Tuvia walks alongside but apart."
tuvia,"Rest and eat. I need volunteers for a scouting party. Zus raises his hand. Tuvia nods in grudging gratitude. However mixed his feelings, Zus can always be counted on."
tuvia, A brigade of independent fighters searching for our comrades.
gramov,What brigade?
tuvia,We belong to the Bielski otriad.
gramov,We know of you. Jewish bandits. Zus's finger tightens on the trigger of his submachine gun.
zus,I'll take the two on the left... Tuvia maintains his composure.
tuvia,I'm sure we can clear up this misunderstanding with your commander.
viktor,"I am Viktor Panchenko, commander of the October otriad. We have had complaints of a Jewish gang stealing from villages loyal to us.  How do you respond to these charges?"
tuvia,"When you take food it is from loyal supporters. When we do, you call it stealing."
viktor,We are soldiers.
tuvia,And we fight a common enemy. The motherland doesn't distinguish between Jews and non-Jews. Viktor is amused by this bit of Soviet dogma.
viktor,But Jews do not fight.
tuvia,These Jews do. Viktor appraises Tuvia for a moment.
viktor,"We will see. Select your best fighters and send them to us. Zus looks at Tuvia, knowing he has no choice."
tuvia,We are honored to be of service. Tuvia and Zus SALUTE and head back the way they came.
zus, So we're partisans now.
tuvia,As if we have a choice.
tuvia,(throwing a smaller
malbin,If my friends at The New Socialists' Club could see me now...  I haven't read a book in months.
tuvia,I haven't read one in years. Malbin looks up from his work.
malbin,.I did. Tuvia laughs ruefully. Considers him for a moment.
tuvia,Yet you accept me as Commander.
malbin,Who else? Tuvia nods. Good point. They continue working.
tuvia,...But--?
malbin,"Other things are important, too."
tuvia,Such as? Malbin tries to think how best to put it.
malbin,Community. Tuvia considers the word. As if trying it on for size.
tuvia,You have more ideas? About all this?
malbin,...A few.
tuvia,I'm listening...
bella,More mouths to feed.
rona,"More young bodies to keep us warm. One ot them, a young man, YITZHAK SHULMAN, RIPS the yellow Star-of-David off his coat and kneels to KISS THE GROUND."
shulman,Which one is Tuvia Bielski? Someone points Tuvia out. Shulman hurries over and kisses Tuvia's hand. Zus is drinking nearby with his cronies.
chaya,My parents-- Zus catches Tuvia's glance to Malbin. Tuvia turns back to Shulman.
tuvia,We'll do what we can.
chaya,You will help my parents?
chaya,"I've seen you looking at me. If you were to rescue them, I would do... anything...you-- Asael is completely undone by the starkness of this."
asael,"No. I mean, yes. All right."
zus,"And what exactly does that mean, 'do what we can.'"
tuvia,We must send for whoever is left alive.
zus,And if it is a hundred? Six hundred?
tuvia,Then we will provide.
zus,And when the Germans follow these hundreds and slaughter us.
tuvia,I won't let that happen. Tuvia exchanges a glance with Malbin. Zus catches it. He has sensed Malbin's growing influence.
zus,You won't let that happen.
tuvia,No. I'll bring them out myself.
zus,From the ghetto.
tuvia,Yes.
zus,"Pan Tuvia. Rabbi Tuvia. Allow me to kiss your hand... Tuvia tries to pull his hand away, but Zus holds him."
tuvia,I cannot have you contradicting me... Not when others are around.  Our family must stick together.
zus,"And who is it that's risking our family, and for what? For the sake of these-- (gestures at the new"
tuvia,Don't call them that.
zus,That's who comes to us from the ghetto. Empty clothes. Bloodsuckers.
tuvia,They are people. Jews.
zus,Pretentious Jews. Jews who stuck up their noses and wouldn't give us the time of day when we passed them on the street. Jews who went out of their way to keep their daughters locked away from our dirty hands.
tuvia,"--What about Bella? Tuvia looks over at Bella, who is anxiously watching."
zus,"Is this your business? Zus gains the upper hand and starts to beat the crap put of Tuvia. Finally, in desperation Tuvia rolls away and picks up a rock. He is about to slam it into his brother's head when suddenly he stops himself. The two brothers look at each other, both breathing heavily -- realizing that they have crossed some line."
asael,No.
zus,"Good. I'll dance at your wedding. He stops by Bella's side, touches her arm, then disappears down the trail. The others follow."
tuvia,This way.
tuvia,There are rumors. Of death camps.
tuvia,What if we were to take all of you?
tuvia,We will protect you. We have made alliances with the Russian Partisans.
tuvia,"YOU WANT TIME? Fine, I give you a day. A month. Maybe a year. To live!  Your husband is waiting for you. An old orthodox RABBI stands nearby."
rabbi,We...are waiting for God. Tuvia looks at him in disbelief. Such madness is incontrovertible. A suspended moment.
lilka,"I am going. This breaks the log jam. Several others join in, ""We are coming,"" ""Us, too,"" etc. Tuvia nods his acknowledgment."
malbin,"And now they belong to the otriad. Everyone sacrifices for the sake of the collective. We can trade these for food or weapons. Next... Nearby, Shimon is INTERVIEWING another line of arrivals."
shimon,--How about carpenters? Any bootmakers? Seamstresses?
riva,I am a nurse.
shimon,"Ahhh...welcome. And you, tateh? OPPENHEIM is an old man with thick glasses."
oppenheim,I am a watchmaker. Tuvia has walked over to observe.
tuvia,Can you repair guns?
oppenheim,Guns? No.
tuvia," See if you can fix this trigger. Oppenheim slips on a pair of spectacles and studies the mechanism. It sticks. He digs into his pocket and produces a small file and expertly begins to shave the metal spur. He tests it, then hands it back to Tuvia, who CLICKS the trigger."
shulman,Look what we found running free. Must have belonged to an aristocrat.
tuvia,"My God, she's beautiful.  May I? He mounts her easily, urges her around the perimeter, greeting the new arrivals. Heads turn as he trots past. He is the center of attention, and he knows it. And likes it."
tuvia,"We will help supply the Russian Partisans by making clothes, repairing guns."
tuvia,Women will learn to use weapons and fight alongside men. Tuvia takes a rifle from Asael and holds it aloft.
little boy, He is a Jew? Lilka is equally struck -- although there is something more than wonder in her regard. She nods.
tuvu,Pregnancies are forbidden. We cannot accommodate an infant's needs. Our bunkers are overcrowded so you will have to build new ones. He looks out over the sea of expectant faces.
riva,You are Tuvia Bielski? You are really him? (Tuvia nods
lilka,Get them off! Get them off me!
chaya,What? Where?
riva,"Lice need somewhere to sleep, too. The others LAUGH, but Lilka is on the verge of hysteria. She stumbles out, stepping on several others as she goes."
tamara,You get rid of them quicker if you boil them.
bella,"Tamara, come on in, it's freezing and slimy and horrible. Tamara shakes her head, no."
riva,So modest...
bella,... So last night I dreamed I was taking a real bath. With hot water.
rachel,And soap.
riva,And bubbles.
chaya,"Oh, take me to that dream!"
riva,I was dreaming of shoes...
chaya,"Shoes, Riva?"
riva,There was a man in a shop on Grudek street... and the way he caressed my feet when I tried on his shoes... Riva swoons. The women burst into ribald laughter. The SOUND of a horse. They look to the opposite bank where: TUVIA RIDES BY on his horse. Lilka can't help but stare.
bella,Doesn't take a fortune teller to know what Lilka's dreaming about... Lilka blushes furiously. The women laugh even louder.
gramov,--buried underneath with this
tamara,"Yesterday, potatoes with beets, Today, beets with potatoes. Special treat tomorrow...potato soup. With beets. Not far away, Arkady and several others have created a primitive still -- turning potatoes into vodka."
arkady,"We love potatoes, don't we, boys! Here, put some hair on your chest! They give Aron his first taste."
nearby,"Bella is walking, arm in arm, with Asael."
bella,So...a little bird told me that a certain someone is waiting...for another certain someone to ask a certain question... Go on... She indicates Chaya by wiggling her eyebrows in her direction. Asael shakes his head but heads in that direction.
asael,"Hello, Chaya."
chaya,"Hello, Asael."
asael,May...I help you?
chaya,Wash clothes? I... don't think so. An awkward moment as he stands there watching her.
asael,Chaya... I...was...wondering...if... maybe...you...I mean... you and I--
chaya,I accept.
asael,You do?
chaya,I do.
asael,"Behold thou art consecrated unto me by this ring according to the Laws of Moses and Israel. But rather than a ring, Asael gives her a shiny new rifle. As the ceremony continues, we:"
zus,Get up! Move! SHOOT OR I'LL SHOOT
viktor,You are related to Bielski?
zus,"I am a Bielski, too. Viktor looks at him appraisingly."
viktor,Indeed. He walks away. Zus has found a home.
asael,There is talk of returning to the ghetto.
tuvia,Madness.
asael,"They've barely eaten in days. Even when our food missions manage to get through, there are armed patrols. Farmers who once helped us now guard their barns with shotguns. Tuvia considers for a moment."
tuvia,"Send out more missions. And bring shotguns. Tuvia sets off. In every face he passes, there's misery and accusation in the shivering bodies and trembling blue lips. Children stare at him with sunken, haunted eyes."
viktor,"Another dead soldier! Zus looks at him, bleary-eyed, confused. Viktor explains:"
zus, That is so...Russian. He cracks open another bottle and takes a big slug.
viktor,At least you drink like one.
zus,"'A Jew can't drink, a Jew can't fight.' What is it we are good at, Viktor? Dying. That is what we are good at."
viktor,So tell me about this brother of yours...
zus,.Asael?
viktor,You are such an idiot.
zus,I know who you mean... The Great Tuvia Bielski. Savior of the Jews and all around Big Shit.
viktor,You compete with him.
zus,He competes with me.
viktor,My older brother and I have the same relationship.
zus,He is a Big Shit also?
viktor,A soldier.  He was killed in the first hour of the German invasion. This sobers them up a bit.
tuvia,Lilka?
lilka,"Sorry, Tuvia. I was...thinking. It's nothing. He looks at her intently, knowing there's more."
tuvia,"Everyone here has lost someone. She looks up at him, helpless to be so revealed."
lilka,You too?
tuvia, Here... He takes off his wool coat and puts it around her shoulders.
lilka,No. Today I go on my first food mission. Tuvia's order has consigned her to this dangerous duty.
tuvia,I will have Asael send someone else.
lilka,No. I must go now. I want to go. She is clearly scared but desperate not to show it. He reaches into his belt and hands her a revolver.
tuvia,"You know how to use this? She nods. Leaving, she passes the Lubczanski brothers, who are on their way in."
motl lubczanski,"She is a tasty one, your aristocrat."
tuvia,She is not my aristocrat.
arkady lubczanski,"No? We were told, 'hands off,' property of the Commander. Tuvia just stares, daring him to continue."
tuvia,Lazar. I am coming from camp. The danger is from those coming to camp.
tuvia,No sign of the food mission?
lazar,Not yet. Tuvia looks anxiously into the deep woods.
shulman,We mustn't have any tracks leading back to base. He loads two sacks of food onto her shoulders.
riva,--several cases of pneumonia... Also I'm beginning to see signs of scurvy. No one's had a vegetable in weeks.
lazar,Tuvia! Lazar is dragging a WOUNDED MAN back into camp.
lilka,Shoo-- Shoo--
tuvia,What's wrong with them all?
riva,If it's typhus we're in trouble. The lice are carriers.
asael,"The partisans have ampicillin. But they say they need it for themselves. In the background Lilka enters, face scratched, blood smeared hands and arms -- like some kind of primitive huntress."
tuvia,"Medicine for typhus. I heard you. I'll go see Viktor right away. On his way out, he passes Lilka, who is being looked after."
lilka,Fine.  Thank you. Tuvia can clearly see that she is shaken -- but he has no time to ask more. He has to find out about the medicine.
tuvia,I must go.
viktor,"--and every time we try to move, they radio back to police HQ which houses the transmitter...here."
zus,--So we attack the transmitter.
viktor,"Yes, yes, my Hebrew warrior. Except for the troops in Stankiewcze and the machine guns out front. THE TENT FLAP OPENS. Tuvia enters. He has developed a cough."
tuvia,We have sickness. I need ampicillin.
viktor,This medicine is reserved for fighters.
tuvia,"If typhus breaks out in our camp, it may spread to yours."
viktor,I will have to take that chance. Zus looks from one immovable force to the other.
tuvia,I must insist. Comrade.
viktor,You'd better not. Zus is watching this dick-measuring with keen interest.
zus,"There would be medicine in the police headquarters at Stankiewcze, yes?"
tuvia,Of course. Zus grabs his submachine gun.
zus,"Krensky, Ben Zion. Let's go."
zus,"Well... He looks into the back where the others wait, anxiously clutching their weapons. Tuvia tries to hold back a cough."
tuvia,I'm going in with you.
zus,"I give the orders tonight. Across the square, the police station looms."
tuvia,You don't have to do this.
zus,I don't?  What about the typhus?
tuvia,So more die. They will anyway. A grim smile from Zus. Tuvia is broken up inside.
zus,"I have been given this mission by my superior officer. He starts to get out the cab. Tuvia reaches into his pocket, takes out the mezuzah that once blessed their parents' home."
tuvia,"Zus...  For luck. Zuz pockets it and joins the others creeping into the shadows. But rather than follow them into the police station, we HOLD on Tuvia's face. Suddenly we HEAR The sound of gunfire. Then nothing. Ten seconds. More gunfire. Twenty. It is excruciating. Thirty. The longest CLOSE-UP in film history."
ben zion,"Let's GO! In the back room, Zus keeps rummaging. A window EXPLODES. Ben Zion is hit. Mortally wounded, he sinks to his knees, returning fire as Zus reappears."
zus,Go. GO!
tuvia,What about the others?!
zus,Medicine.
tuvia,The others?
zus,"Fighters die so that malbushim may live, that's what you believe, yes? Tuvia absorbs the accusation as if taking a punch."
tuvia,"So you're a communist now, Zus? Zus lays his head back on the seat, closes his eyes."
zus,"Communist, Zionist, Manicurist, what difference does it make? You got your medicine."
tuvia,Come back to us. Zus won't look at him.
zus,So you remember.
shimon,"Merciful God, we commit our friends Ben Zion and Krensky to your care. We have no more prayers, no more tears. We have run out of blood. Choose another people We PAN PAST the familiar faces."
arkady,"Next time, I cut off your nose, pisher. Tuvia emerges from his bunker. He is weaving a bit and his words are slurred."
tuvia,"Whassa problem, Arkady?"
arkady,Those who risk their lives to bring back food deserve a larger portion than those who risk nothing.
asael,Everyone gets the same portion.
arkady,"Not when you're serving, pisher. I see you digging to the bottom of the pot for your little forest cutie and her parents..."
asael,She is my wife!
tuvia,Policy is...Same for all. If someone is stealing he'll face consequences. Asael is astonished that Tuvia would go against him in public and embarrassed by his public drunkenness.
asael,What consequences? Others are closely watching this test of Tuvia's authority.
tuvia,Reduced rations for one week.  Both of you.
asael,"Tuvia, I would never--"
tuvia,Yes. I know.
asael,Then why am I to be punished...? Tuvia just takes another swallow from his bottle.
tuvia,--What?
asael,...that you drink too much and are no longer fit to lead us.
tuvia,.Maybe they're right. Asael looks at him. No longer the brother he once idealized.
asael,Zus would have punched him senseless.
tuvia,Zus.
asael,I miss him.
tuvia,He has made his choice. He reels away toward the woods.
shimon,Drink this.
tuvia,"...the way they look at me... with their pasty faces. Let them starve, we're all going to die out here anyway."
shimon,Not easy being the big boss. Moses was a lonely man when he led us out of bondage.
tuvia,...Moses.
shimon,"So I'm a sucker for a biblical allusion. But what is society without leaders. Without leaders, we falter."
tuvia,I am not a leader.
shimon,"Neither was Moses, but somehow that seemed to work out."
zus,"Lova, what happened? Who did this? Lova sits and buries his head in his hands."
lova,Gramov. Two others. I used the officer's latrine.
zus,For this they beat you? Lova is trying not to weep.
lova,They said they wouldn't shit in the same hole as a Jew. Zus gets to his feet.
zus,"Forgive me, Commander."
panchenko,Zus. Join us. He offers him a glass of vodka. Zus doesn't take it.
zus,I want to report the mistreatment of a comrade. Gramov looks up. Zus meets his eye.
gramov,I had a perfectly good reason. He is a Jew. The other men LAUGH. Panchenko frowns at Gramov.
panchenko,--and you are an ignorant Tartar.  Ignore him. Here...
zus,Anti-semitism is a violation of Party discipline. Panchenko sighs. Does he really have to deal with this?
panchenko,"He's right, Gramov. Apologize to the Jew."
gramov,"I apologize, Jew."
panchenko,There. You see?  Now drink up. Zus doesn't know what to do. He accepts the vodka.
lilka,Your fever broke in the night. The medicine helped.
tuvia,How long was I asleep?
lilka,Two days.
tuvia,And you've nursed me the whole time?
lilka,Chaya helped.
tuvia,Did you study nursing at university?
lilka,We devoted ourselves to more essential knowledge -- like Greek Philosophy and Latin.
tuvia,I never went to university.
lilka,What kind of work did you do? Before.
tuvia,My wife's father had a store. Before the Race Laws.  She is is dead.
lilka,I'm sorry.
tuvia,Tell me more about university.
lilka,It all feels like a dream. I spent months trying to master Chopin's nocturnes.
tuvia,I'd love to hear you play.
lilka,You know Chopin?
tuvia,Who doesn't? Chopin the butcher from Novogrudok.
tuvia,"Thank you, Lilka."
lazar,"Hey, Arkady This isn't soup, it's piss."
arkady,"I will piss on your head and you will say it's raining. Eat it. The rest of Lubczanski's cabal laughs. TUVIA emerges from his bunker. The first thing he sees is Asael, whose face is BATTERED AND SWOLLEN."
tuvia,What happened? Asael just looks over at the food line -- where Arkady has grabbed Chaya by the waist -- to the delight of the others. Tuvia strides over to them.
arkady,New policy. Fighters get better food.
tuvia,Against my orders...
arkady,"You are no longer Commander. Sorry. Tuvia nods, considering his remark for a moment."
tuvia,"As long as I am the leader of this group, you will obey my commands."
chaya,Who has the soap? I know there was a little left?
bella,Use the sand. It's good for your skin.
riva,"And what skin! And already married, too! Bella laughs. Chaya splashes her playfully with water."
bella,I've turned into a skeleton.
chaya,And you were always so worried about staying slim.
bella,When we get out of this forest I am going to eat only cake and grow as big as a house. Tamara appears. She's wearing a long overcoat.
lilka,Join us. At least the sun is warm.  Tamara?
tamara,"I can't, Lilka...  I'm pregnant."
lilka,I had no idea.
tamara,I've kept it hidden for months but now it's obvious. No one can know. They move away from the others. Tamara shows her.
lilka,..Who is the father?
tamara,I--- It was when I was escaping. A man with a gun stopped me. I thought he was a Partisan. He told me to follow him and he took me to this place... The memory overwhelms her. She begins to break down.
lilka,He will understand.
tamara,No. You mustn't tell him!
lilka,I won't. Don't worry.  What are you going to do? Tamara's eyes fill with a new resolve.
tamara,"I feel this new life inside me. It's the only thing keeping me going. I won't give it up, I'll kill myself. Lilka puts her arm around her."
malbin,You call that a move?
shimon,I call it an inevitable conclusion based on unimpeachable reasoning.
malbin,I'm thinking about what I'm going to do about it.
shimon,Aha! I got him!
malbin,You didn't get me. You think you got me? How about this?
malbin,A genius maybe. Tuvia has been listening nearby. Aron races into the camp.
aron,Tuvia... We SEE Aron whispering in Tuvia's ear.
tuvia, Asael! Asael comes running.
asael,"Lazar spotted another patrol. They're getting closer. Tuvia nods. Suddenly, he HEARS a strange sound. An animal?"
tuvia,Do you hear that?
lilka,She promises not to take extra food...
tuvia,This is against my orders.
lilka,"So you are going to shoot her, too? Tuvia stares at her. He has never seen this side of her."
tuvia,I cannot allow it. He turns away.
lilka,You must let it live!
tuvia,I cannot keep the living alive. Tamara and the man who fathered this child are responsible for its fate.
lilka,"She was raped by the Nazis. Tuvia closes his eyes. He is tired of being in charge, tired of being the arbiter of other peoples' fate."
tuvia,Lilka...
lilka,I knew what was expected of the women here -- yet you never touched me...
tuvia,Shhh..
lilka,"I'm not afraid of anything, Tuvia. I'm not even afraid of you. They kiss deeply."
tuvia,The Germans are coming into the forest. I don't know what is going to become of us.
lilka,It doesn't matter. If I had stayed in the ghetto I'd be dead. You saved my life.
tuvia,No. You have saved mine. He reaches for her but before they can begin to make love again-- THE BLANKET DOOR IS PUSHED ASIDE. Malbin is there.
malbin,"Oh... ..I..... Hello, Lilka."
lilka,"Hello, Asael."
tuvia,Yes?
malbin,We've caught one.
asael,He's a scout.
tuvia,"They're coming for us. Group members have begun to gather around him. They begin to hurl insults -- schtik drek, paskudnyak -- as the hapless man is pushed to his knees."
asael,We found this in his pouch. He hands Tuvia a sheaf of documents -- including a map.
tuvia,"Entrance points, wetlands, obstacles.  You read this."
shimon, They've assigned an entire division to surround the forest. A tidal wave is coming.
asael,Don't they have a war to fight?
shimon," Assault begins in two days. Passover. How fitting. Meanwhile, some of the group have begun TORMENTING the man."
motl,Monster! He kicks him in the head.
shulman,Bulvan! Shulman PUNCHES him in the face.
german courier,Bitte....Bitte...
tuvia, Did you reach Viktor?
asael,He's on his way. The tormenting of the poor courier is gaining intensity.
german courier,Ich habe frau und kinder!
shimon,"He says he has a wife and children. Lazar picks up a stick. The German tries to crawl away; the crowd blocks his escape, pushing him back into the center."
lazar,So did I!
riva,"If you let him go, he will lead them back here. Tuvia looks at Malbin. What to do?"
malbin,Ask if he'll promise not to reveal our location. Shimon translates.
shimon,"Sie mussen versprechen nicht zu sagan wo wir sind. The man looks up at him, pleadingly."
german courier,Nein....Nein...
shulman,He'll say anything. He breaks the stick across the man's back.
lazar,We want justice...
motl,"Justice... Soon it is a chant: ""Justice! .Justice!"" Tuvia looks at their faces. Only months ago they were decorous, civilized. Now they are hungry, almost feral. Murderous. Bella has been silently watching. She steps into the circle, looks down at the terrified German man."
bella,My son's name was David. David Kagan. We SEE now that she is holding a sharpened hoe.
riva,"My sister's name was Ellie... As she swings the shovel, the CAMERA begins to back away. Miriam steps forward, carrying a large rock."
miriam,"My husband was Meyer... The group closes in, obscuring our view of the body. Aron can't take any more. He runs off into the woods."
motl,"My parents, Sol and Raya."
avram,"For my daughter, Sonya."
mordecai,For my mother.
rachel,My sister.
lilka,My whole family.
tuvia,Reeboynoy shel oylum... Lord of the Universe. We have done unspeakable things yet still I seek your mercy... He HEARS something. Malbin waits at the edge of the forest. His face is drawn and pale from what has just happened.
malbin,Viktor is here.
zus,He doesn't look good.
asael,I could say the same about you. Where'd you get the jacket?
zus,Let's just say the former owner no longer had need of it. Zus winks. The other bodyguards stare impassively.
viktor,You found these on the prisoner? Tuvia nods. Viktor studies the scout's documents. Tisking.
tuvia,We can't fight an entire division.
viktor,"The battle on the Eastern Front has begun. The more troops we engage here, the fewer they have to attack the Motherland."
tuvia,We've done our part for the Motherland.
viktor,My orders are to take command of all partisan operations. You will bring the rest of your fighters to me.
tuvia,"And the others? Old people, women and children."
viktor,In war there are casualties.
tuvia,And if I refuse?
viktor,You are officially a deserter. Do you know the policy on dealing with deserters? Viktor unfolds a paper flyer from his pocket.
asael,I wouldn't show this around. There are some who'd turn you in for less.
zus,You want them to find Tuvia's camp. Viktor just looks at him.
viktor,No. So we can keep fighting. Everyone must sacrifice in the struggle.
zus,Those are my brothers.
viktor,"I am your brother! He is your brother! Comrade Zus. Your Jewish sentimentality is heart-warming, but counter-revolutionary. Zus has secretly known he would hear these words. He grips his rifle but holds his tongue."
shimon,"...but the children of Israel were afraid to leave Egypt. Until Moses said, 'Do not trust in me, trust in God.' He will take care of you'  And so tomorrow we celebrate the Passover by sitting around and arguing just as we have done for centuries. Tuvia stares at them, a curious expression on his face. Malbin comes to stand beside him."
malbin, Did it see us?
tuvia,Tomorrow is Passover. Yes?
malbin,...How should I know?
tuvia,Moses. The Exodus. Malbin doesn't get it at first.
malbin,"You want to move them all? The old, the sick. They'll never make it. It isn't the first time Tuvia has consigned people to their death, and apparently it won't be the last."
tuvia,We leave now. Spread the word.
asael,"Come, tateh--"
oppenheim,"But my tools-- The SOUND of approaching aircraft. Tuvia searches the sky. Riva pairs each of the elderly with a child. Tamara tucks her newborn under her coat. The SOUND of the approaching aircraft grows LOUDER. People look up, shielding their eyes. Then from out of the sun, two ominous silhouettes:"
malbin,"Are you alright? Tuvia shakes his head, points to his ears. He cannot hear."
asael,Get them out of the bunkers! Malbin runs off. Asael helps Tuvia to his feet. A nearby explosion SHOWERS THEM with dirt as they CRAWL to safety. The world RAMPS BACK TO NORMAL SPEED at a dizzying rate.
asael,"With Levine and Miriam... There.  And me. Tuvia shakes his head, no."
malbin,Everybody out! Now! But the group's natural reaction is to stay huddled in safety
tuvia,Don't try to fight... Just slow them down. Then join us. Asael nods. No need for more words. They embrace fiercely. Asael pushes Chaya toward Tuvia.
asael,"Take her. She resists, clinging to his arm for a moment."
tuvia,Come. He forces her to join him and catch up to the others.
malbin, This swamp here...goes...for miles.
tuvia,Show me.
malbin,"Oh, my God..."
tuvia,Are the others back yet?  ..Asael? Malbin shakes his head once more. Asael is not coming back. Chaya begins to weep. Riva comforts her.
shulman,We've got to keep going!
bella,The Germans will be here any minute!
malbin, Do we wait...a while?
mordecai,We could hide...
motl,Yes. Fight!
shulman,"That's crazy! Tuvia is in hell. If he waits for Asael, he risks them all being caught. Suddenly it all falls apart. Tuvia sinks to his knees as if his legs can no longer bear his weight."
malbin,"Tuvia--? Tuvia can't speak. He has no more answers. Nothing to say. He stares at the impenetrable swamp. The end of the line. The sudden vacuum of leadership is felt by them all. They stare at one another, anxious and rudderless."
rona,There are snakes-- Tamara's newborn is crying. She tries to comfort it. An old woman stares at the swamp in terror.
shulman,We'll put them on our shoulders.
bella,"Tuvia, what do we do? Oppenheim is petrified. Rona is crying."
shimon," ...He... ..is... ..tired. Malbin hears something, looks up."
tuvia,"You have a weapon? She shows him her revolver. He checks the clip, then looks into her eyes."
voice,Why are we stopping? Everyone turns. It's Asael. Back from the dead. He hands off a wounded comrade to Riva's care.
tamara,In there?
rona,It is impossible! More murmuring. Asael raises his voice.
asael,"Nothing is impossible! What we have done is impossible! The murmuring quiets. Asael meets Tuvia's eyes. He is literally willing his older brother to be strong for them, as he has been, time and again."
rona,But how?
asael,Not by miracles. By our strength.
shulman,We don't have enough rope.
asael,We'll link arms. Make a chain. A human chain.
motl,"What are you talking about? Tuvia is deeply moved. His little brother has become a man. Once more, he finds his voice."
tuvia,"Each person takes care of the other.  .Give him your belt. Asael nods at Tuvia gratefully. The group is hushed, apprehensive. Then:"
one man,Removes his belt and offers it to Asael.
tuvia,No tracks on land. Get back in. It is almost impossible to make any progress. Especially when one is weak and malnourished.
tuvia,"Come... Shimon can't catch his breath, he just shakes his head, no. He can't go on. Tuvia half-drags, half-carries him onward."
malbin,Is he...? Tuvia shakes his head. It's only a matter of time. The Spotter Plane drones overhead.
tuvia,Take off your glasses. Reflections. Tuvia moves off to check on the others.
malbin,"Shimon, listen to me, the physical plane is just an illusion. Only the spiritual plane is real."
shimon, No. The physical plane is where man acts to redeem himself.
malbin,"You've redeemed yourself enough, you should shut up now."
shimon,Look who's talking about shutting up... I need to tell you something.
malbin, What is it?
shimon,You shouldn't think so much. The world around you is beautiful.
malbin, This world?
shimon,Even this one. Tuvia has come to sit beside Lilka. She leans into him.
tuvia,We're lost.
lilka,No. ..No. She puts her arms around him.
from nearby,The LIGHTS of their fire can be seen flickering through the reeds as the ragged column MOVES SILENTLY past.
tuvia,Not a sound. Pass the word. We watch as the ORDER is passed down the line. Parents hold hands over their childrens' mouths. Shimon is carried on an improvised litter made of branches.
panchenko,You will hold this crossroads until the brigade has completed its retreat. Zus looks around at the position.
zus,For how long? Panchenko's orders are never to be questioned.
panchenko,Until you are ordered to withdraw.
zus,"And if we cannot hold the position? Panchenko looks at Gramov, who stands nearby cradling a submachine gun."
panchenko,"Comrade Gramov will enforce discipline, if necessary. Gramov smiles. The implications are clear: nobody retreats."
zus," I am so honored, Comrade. Panchenko wheels his horse and gallops off. Zus and his men take cover in the woods. In the distance we can HEAR the unmistakable SOUND of approaching armor. Lova kneels beside Zus."
lova,"What are we doing here? Zus? Half a mile down the road, A TANK rumbles into view."
shulman,"What's next...Sinai? Tuvia can't help but laugh. Soon they are all laughing. It ripples throughout the group. Joyous. Contagious. An overwhelming feeling of relief. They are safe. Tuvia lies on the ground. All the adrenaline has suddenly left his body. Then Aron appears, tugging at his sleeve. Shimon is asking for him. Tuvia kneels down beside his teacher, whose eyes are closed. Malbin is weeping quietly. Who will he argue with?"
shimon, .Tuvia...
tuvia,Right here. Shimon is at the end.
shimon,...Something...to say...
tuvia,Shhhh...
shimon,...no...please...  I almost lost...my faith....but you...were sent..by God..to save us.
tuvia,Ridiculous.
shimon,"I know... ... But just...in case... .I thank....HIM... .and I thank you. He closes his eyes. It's too much for Tuvia. Hard as he tries, he cannot stop the tears from filling his eyes."
tuvia,"Back to the river! He pushes people down. They cling to the banks, cowering. THOSE WITH WEAPONS take cover, using the embankment as if it were the lip of a trench. They RETURN FIRE -- old men, young women, even some children."
up ahead,A stand of trees hides Tuvia from view as he climbs out of the river and heads into the forest. He pulls Malbin down just as A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY approaches and begins to set up a heavy machine gun.
tuvia,Only weapons and ammunition! Spread the word. Tuvia hands him the machine gun.
asael,Anything else? Tuvia looks at him. Is he fucking with him? Just a little.
tuvia,Go on. Lilka is carrying a small child.
lilka,What about the dead?
tuvia,"Everybody gather your things! We have to get out of the open! Nearby, Aron removes the machine from the tank and hands it to Zus. Bella approaches. Zus embraces her. Tuvia seizes one of the German rifles. He yells to Shulman."
zus,Good question.
tuvia,You are going back?
zus,No. They look at each other. So much unsaid. No time to say it.
tuvia,We've got to build a new camp. Zus nods.
zus,Perhaps you have room for one more?
tuvia,Don't you hear it?
zus,What...?
tuvia,Nothing. Isn't it beautiful? We HOLD on Tuvia. He has aged ten years in one.
elderly man,"Here is money. I can get more. So much more. Take it, please."
cab driver,"No, no... Indeed, when the CABBIE speaks, though the voice is older and somewhat frail, we recognize it as Tuvia's."
elderly man,"What else can I give you, do for you?"
aged tuvia,"Nothing, it isn't necessary. Tears stream down the elderly man's cheeks."
elderly man,We are alive because of you.  My children. His children. So many. .Thousands.
aged tuvia,"Please, the traffic..."
elderly man,"Bless you, Tuvia Bielski. May the Lord bless you and keep you all the days of your life."
elderly man,"That wasn't a man. That was an angel. As the cab pulls away, the CAMERA CRANES UP until it is lost in an anonymous sea of traffic. These words appear on"
