sunset,The glowing orb ripples like a blood-red eye.
2.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN No!... I took the bread. PETER That's not true. ROBIN They're not interested in truth. You are too weak, Peter. You would not live through it. The Interrogator stares into Robin's eyes. INTERROGATOR Sacrifice for the weaker? How noble... As you wish... Cut off this one's hand as well!... But first... He indicates an Arab prisoner, who is dragged forward. His struggling hand is laid on the executioner's block. INTERROGATOR Show them the courage of Allah. The prisoner's face braces for the pain. A red-hot scimitar flashes down. The hand flips into a basket. Twitching. Robin is next. His composure fails. He flops to his knees, crying. The Interrogator laughs. The jailers unlash the thongs on Robin's hand. They stretch it out, forcing it down. Robin goes limp, sobbing. Peter catches his eye... Robin winks. The scimitar. Drawn from the coals. Spitting flame. Arcs down. Robin is suddenly galvanized. ROBIN And this is English courage. He hurls his holders aside. Swings upward, driving his fast into the executioner's throat. Grabs the sword. Slash. His thongs melt like butter. A jailer leaps at him. Steaming, the scimitar slices into the man's chest. Despite his bindings, Peter wrestles the Interrogator. Knife pressed to his throat, Peter is forced against the furnace. At the last second, he flips the man into the fire. Screaming. PETER That's for five years of hell. "
3.,CONTINUED: A jailer aims a scalding blade at Robin's back. VOICE 
4.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN Why should we trust you? SARACEN If you don't, you are dead men. ROBIN He makes a point. The door bursts open.    More guards rush in. ROBIN A good point. He slashes the man free."
peter,"Robin! ROBIN Whatever blood is in his veins, he does not deserve to die here. SARACEN This way! He beckons them to the back.     A hidden door leads into a tunnel."
saracen,"You are fast, my friend. ROBIN Five years I've waited for the smell of free air. That makes a man fast. Guards drop down from above, carrying torches.    Blocking the way. SARACEN You will need to be yet faster. A narrow opening to their left... they splash through. Half running, half crawling in the dank water. Fire arrows land around them. The orange smoke is choking. "
5.,"CONTINUED: SARACEN Poison air.   Hold your breath. Flames illuminate the walls, alive with a loathsome mass of crawling slime. Peter falls. A pursuer descends on him, thrusting a blazing torch at his face. The Saracen intercepts the blow. Grabs the man's neck, SNAPPING it with one mighty twist. PETER  Thanks. I misjudged you. SARACEN Save your breath."
6.,"CONTINUED: Swoosh. An arrow pierces through Peter's chest -- fired from the prison wall. He reels... Robin leads him under the wall for protection. Shouts of alarm. Soldiers approaching. ROBIN Come, Peter.    We must hurry. Raising his sword, Peter faces the oncoming soldiers. PETER It is mortal.    Leave me. ROBIN Hold on to my shoulder."
7.,"DESERTED ALLEY - LATER Robin and the Saracen catch their breath. ROBIN Farewell, friend. God speed you on your way. SARACEN Our way is together. With the speed of Allah. He grins.    This strange man has a sense of humor. ROBIN I go to England."
saracen,"Then I go to England. ROBIN England?   Why? SARACEN You saved my life. I must stay with you until I save yours. ROBIN Go your own way. I relieve you of your obligation. SARACEN Only Allah can do that. ROBIN And if I don't want you? SARACEN You have no choice... unless you think you can kill me. He grins broadly.      Offers his hand. SARACEN My name is Aslan. Resigned, Robin takes the proferred hand. ROBIN Robin of Locksley. You know a short route to England, Aslan? CUT TO:"
8.,"EXT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE  Eerie shapes. Weaving. White light on water. The moon reflected in the moat of a small castle. Towers shrouded in night mist. Smoke curls from a chimney. SUPERIMPOSE:   LOCKSLEY CASTLE, NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND"
9.,CONTINUED: KENNETH They've taken my Gwen.    My daughter. LOCKSLEY Who has taken her? KENNETH Men on horses. In masks.  We tried to stop them. My son is dead.
10.,"CONTINUED: KENNETH Nearby the Gregor Caves. Locksley reacts -- a hint of fear. They move on... Ahead, the hillside glows, rimmed in eerie light. Strange primitive CHANTS, wafted on the wind. Locksley ties his nervous horse to a tree. Parting undergrowth, Kenneth creeps forward. Cries out. He's face to face with the maggot-eaten skull of a goat. Beyond it, a gruesome host of half-skinned human skulls, all arranged on stakes. Some male, others with rotting female tresses, staring eyelessly into the night. Kenneth turns to run... A hand grabs him."
locksley,"Steady, man. They are to dissuade the faint of heart. Think of Gwen. From the crest of the rise, they peer down into the craggy valley. A cave opening, ablaze with flames leers at them like the mouth of hell. Before the cave, a circle of stones. A miniature Stonehenge. A medieval orgy. Men and women in masks and loose robes. Dancing. Drinking. Reveling. Pure carnality. Lord Locksley and Kenneth watch in horror. Faces ashen. KENNETH Druids. LOCKSLEY I trusted we were rid of such evil a century ago."
11.,"CONTINUED: LOCKSLEY Gwen? Kenneth nods. The Demon shrieks, dervishing around GWEN, who  is carried onto the central plinth stone. A pagan   altar, the shape of an elephant's head with its trunk  raised. A masked figure stands at the head of the altar.   The high priest of the dark rite. The girl's body shudders as blood-red liquid is forced down her throat. The Demon's voice is husky and hideous. DEMON Come, my virgin flower. Hypnotized by the creature's voice and snake-like move- ments, Gwen stretches herself out. A single beam of sunlight slices through the mist, like a laser. The first light of the rising sun, it strikes directly on the altar, tracking down towards the girl's heart. The Demon's raised talons close in on the white flesh of her neck. Gwen's eyes are open wide, in a trance. The crowd of revelers encircle the plinth. Awed anticipation... A warrior's yell! Sword raised, Locksley THUNDERS in on his CHARGER. The terrified crowd parts. The Demon screams like a banshee. DEMON Kill him!   Kill him! The followers throw themselves at   Locksley. He beats them off. The high priest issues    orders to armed guards, who run to intercept. One aims a    spear. Locksley hacks the shaft in half. Cuts men down    left and right. Reaches the altar stone. LOCKSLEY Gwen!   Up, girl, up! Gwen shakes off her trance. The Demon launches itself at Locksley. Talons rip flesh from his face. With all his strength, Locksley hurls the creature down. LOCKSLEY In the name of God! His broadsword swings in a mighty arc. Slices across the gargoyle's skull. Clean through half the face... Impossibly, the demon rolls back to its feet. "
12.,"CONTINUED: The head is an elaborate mask -- beneath are the yellow skin, white hair, and burning red eyes of an albino crone. Screaming vitriol, the hag is unharmed. Momentarily stunned, Locksley regains his senses, hauls the girl onto his charger. The guards close in. Locksley spurs his horse. Rides for an opening. The masked high priest stands resolutely in his path. Brandishing a burning branch. The horse is freaked. Rears. Locksley and the girl are thrown. Unarmed, Locksley charges the man. Slams him into the cave wall. The mask falls. Locksley gasps in recognition."
locksley,"Nottingham! The SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM. Powerful build, black beard, cruel intensity in every feature. NOTTINGHAM You are an unwelcome surprise, Locksley. LOCKSLEY The King shall hear of this, Nottingham. NOTTINGHAM I think not. Locksley is surrounded. One by one the men reveal their faces. Locksley backs up in shock, recognizing them."
locksely,"God help us. NOTTINGHAM One day all England will worship with us. LOCKSLEY Never. The crone spits venom in his face. DEMON I am Mortianna. You will die with my name on your lips. Locksley's agonized cry fills the valley. On the hill- side, Kenneth averts his eyes. Turns to run. Five masked figures block his way."
13.,"EXT. ENGLISH SHORE - DAY A twelfth century French sailboat at anchor.    A cross on its sail. A longboat rows to shore. Robin stands in the prow, in a pilgrim's hooded robe. He gazes at the approaching land. Unable to wait, he leaps into the surf and wades to the beach. He kneels, pressing his hands and face into the soil. ROBIN Home.    Thank you, Lord. Aslan steps from the boat, sniffing the air. The French sailors keep their distance from him. Robin takes his hand."
robin,"My friend, you have escorted me home. I beg you to free yourself of your vow. Return with the boat. I know how heavy your heart must be, this far from your family and native land... ASLAN  Because I love them so dearly, I cannot dishonor them. A sailor creeps up behind Aslan, club in hand. ROBIN I thought you'd say that. He nods to the sailor, who swings the club down. The Saracen sidesteps, grabs the man's arm and flips him into the surf. He turns a cold stare on Robin."
aslan,"No man controls my destiny. Especially not one who attacks downwind and stinks of garlic. Robin laughs.    The Saracen remains intense. ASLAN If our positions were reversed, I would have done the same. Only I would have succeeded. He smiles broadly.    Robin claps him on the shoulder. ROBIN Come, Aslan. By nightfall we will celebrate your honor when we dine with my father."
14.,"EXT./INT. PEASANT'S COTTAGE - DAY CRASH! An armored foot splinters the door of a farmer's hovel. Children scream and run. A soldier clubs at them, laughing. Outside. More soldiers. Some on horses, others on foot, with leashed hounds. Pillaging. Vandalizing. Searching. GUY GISBORNE: An impressive figure on horseback. Strikingly handsome -- except that one of his ears is missing. We recognize his face from the Druid ceremony. He coldly addresses a pregnant woman with a child in her arms, FANNY. GISBORNE You owe the sheriff three bushels of flax. FANNY You starve us. First the drought, now you take what food we have left. GISBORNE For starving people, you look fat enough. SOLDIER "
15.,"CONTINUED: FANNY No, Wulf! Don't! 'Twill only make it worse. Wulf backs off.   Nostrils flaring with repressed hate. GISBORNE Seize him! While two soldiers grab the Boy, others examine his hiding place. A secret thatched door, built into the side of a haystack... a bow and quiver... and a deer carcass. Gisborne dismounts. GISBORNE This is Lord Nottingham's deer. Is this how you repay the Sheriff for his protection? WULF  Like a wolf protects sheep. FANNY I killed it.   We needed the meat. GISBORNE Poachers hang. Either he dies or you die. WULF My mother lies to protect me. FANNY No, Wulf! Gisborne drags the boy to the carcass."
gisborne,"You have deprived us of a hunt, boy. He cups his hand in the deer's blood.    Smears it on Wulf's face. GISBORNE The hounds know the scent well. He tosses his bloody glove to the dogs. They tear at each other in their effort to rip at the glove. GISBORNE Run, boy. Like a deer. Give us some pleasure before you die. "
16.,"CONTINUED: To the accompaniment of the HOUNDS' savage HOWLS and the horrified screams of his family, Wulf runs. GISBORNE Unleash them!"
aslan,"In your land am I not the infidel? The unbeliever, the instrument of evil? ROBIN Our races have fought for a hundred years to prove that point. ASLAN Then I trust it is safer to appear as your slave than as your equal. ROBIN For an 'infidel' you have uncommon clarity of thinking. Yet you refuse to tell me about your home and family. ASLAN Those are my burdens."
robin,"You speak my language. You have the diplomacy and honor code of a nobleman. I ask again, why were you to be executed? The Saracen maintains a moody silence. ROBIN So, I must continue with my guesswork. You are highborn? Probably... You fell from favor... Clearly... Why? You broke the law? You were a rival for power? ... A woman? "
17.,"CONTINUED: The Saracen reacts, almost imperceptibly. ROBIN By the Lord, that's it! Aslan is silent, but Robin knows he's right. ROBIN They say there are Arab women of such beauty that they can possess a man's mind, that he would be willing to die for them. Is that not so? Ignoring him, the Saracen stops.      Examines the darkening sky. ASLAN It is close to sunset. ROBIN Your people must marry women chosen for them by others, right? No reply.    Aslan unfolds a prayer rug. ROBIN Who is she? The Mullah's daughter? ... Another man's wife?... That's it! ASLAN Endless clouds. Is there no sun in your cursed country? ROBIN You dog! You painted old dog! What is her name? ASLAN Which way is East? ROBIN Her name? ASLAN East? ROBIN Her name? ASLAN East?!!! Robin folds his arms.    A standoff. "
18.,"CONTINUED: ASLAN Damn you!... Jasmina. ROBIN Ah, Jasmina!    Is she beautiful? ASLAN Which way is East? ROBIN That way. Aslan throws his rug on the ground.    Kneels. ASLAN Are you sure? ROBIN I would know blindfolded. I'm five miles from home... Was she worth it? ASLAN Worth dying for. Robin stands smiling over him as Aslan begins his prayers... BAYING of HUNTING DOGS... In the distance, the boy Wulf runs toward them, ducks behind a tree and clubs the leading dog with a branch. The other hounds close in... panting with exhaustion, Wulf swings into the branches. A hound savages his leg. The soldiers surround the tree. The boy clambers precariously onto the highest branch... Robin surrep- titiously steals a crossbow from one of the soldiers' horses."
gisborne,"You're not playing by    the rules, boy. Deer don't climb     trees... Perhaps he thinks he's    a game bird. Shall we teach     him to fly? Cut it down! The soldiers hack at the trunk.    The tree quivers. ROBIN Hold!... I am curious as to what manner of creature is so fearsome that it takes six men to attack it. Shrouded in his pilgrim's hooded cloak, he approaches them. "
19.,"CONTINUED: GISBORNE Stand back, stranger. This is no affair of yours. ROBIN Have we treed the devil himself? Let me see... Ah ha! A small boy. A truly dangerous animal. GISBORNE I advise you to move on, pilgrim. This is the Sheriff's land. ROBIN Wrong. This is my land, and my tree. Therefore, whatever is in it also belongs to me. GISBORNE I grow dangerously tired of your wit... Chop it down! ROBIN The man who strikes that tree dies. He glances nervously at Aslan, who's still at his prayers. The men stop in mid-swing. More surprised than scared. Gisborne gestures to the largest of them. GISBORNE Chop down the hooded fool. ROBIN  Perhaps we could discuss this."
20.,"CONTINUED: Aslan ignores him, lost in his   prayers. Robin lifts the other arm -- a second concealed   crossbow. WHUMPF! The bolt flips the dog handler into   the vicious pack. Dead or not, he soon will be. Robin    unsheathes his sword. ROBIN Aslan, get off your damn knees! I have four of them cornered. The Saracen remains head down. Or did we see him steal a glance? Gisborne signals his men to attack. A wave of flashing steel. ROBIN I hope there's enough of me to satisfy you all. Backed up to a tree, he grabs a branch and kicks out. Two men fly back. He lunges at a third. His sword strikes flesh. Robin sidesteps and hurls the fourth onto a sharp tree stump. Gisborne thrusts. Robin reacts too slowly.       Blood flows from his arm. His sword falls. ROBIN Aslan!! Gisborne is on him, sword pressed to his back.      Robin freezes. GISBORNE Well, hooded stranger, allow me to know your name before I run you through."
21.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN Now get off my land. And tell your cousin the Sheriff what happens to his scum when they pick on my people. Gisborne takes off, colliding with Aslan as he folds his rug. Reacts in shock at the sight of the strange Arab. Keeps running. ROBIN "
22.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN Ha!   It was you he was scared of. Aslan's humor is infectious.     Robin's anger relents. ROBIN Come, my strange friend. Beyond that hill lies the prettiest little castle in all Christendom. Warm hearths, hot food, real beds. ASLAN With feather pillows? ROBIN With feather pillows. Warm and soft like Jasmina's embrace."
23.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN  Damn you, Duncan. Why didn't you cut him down? DUNCAN Master Robin, is it you? A miracle. I thought God had abandoned us. ROBIN You left my father to hang like a common thief, carrion for the crows."
aslan,"Easy... Look at him. Duncan steps into the moonlight.    His face crudely- scarred. ROBIN What has happened? DUNCAN They say they captured him worshipping with the Druids. He signed a confession before the Bishop of Hereford. ROBIN Did they have witnesses? DUNCAN Just one. Kenneth of Cowfall. The Bishop decreed all the Locksley lands forfeit. ROBIN Did you believe the charges? DUNCAN Not even when they took my eyes. ROBIN Who did this to you, Duncan? DUNCAN Guy of Gisborne. With the sheriff looking on. Robin holds the old retainer to his chest.    Stares into the night in silent rage."
24.,EXT. NOTTINGHAM CASTLE - NIGHT Marked contrast.   A forbidding fortress.   Cliff-like battlements.
25.,"CONTINUED: NOTTINGHAM Ha! The prodigal son returns. He is a whelp. This girl could best him. GISBORNE This whelp bested five of my men in the blink of an eye. NOTTINGHAM Your men were probably drunk.   Yet you survived, cousin? Heavy scorn. The sheriff pats Gisborne's hand like a child's. The voice from the darkness becomes a loud CHANT. A wrinkled, monkey-like figure dances INTO VIEW, wearing a necklace of human fingers. You might think she was a hundred years old, if not for her incredible agility. MORTIANNA. GISBORNE "
26.,CONTINUED: MORTIANNA Ally with royal blood. NOTTINGHAM Put someone on the throne and rule through him? Who? MORTIANNA That is not revealed. The idea takes shape in Nottingham's mind.      Mounting intensity. NOTTINGHAM Ally with royal blood. What else do you see? MORTIANNA Armies. NOTTINGHAM Whose? MORTIANNA Yours. Men and weaponry in great numgers. NOTTINGHAM And victory? MORTIANNA Much blood will be spilled. NOTTINGHAM Whose?
close shot,A dice splashes blood. Lands -- a death's head symbol. Mortianna hammers the platter. The dice spins and lands again. Again the grinning skull.
27.,"CONTINUED: GISBORNE  No one. I have seen no one. MORTIANNA You lie!     A man... A painted man. NOTTINGHAM What is wrong? MORTIANNA I have seen my death. She whimpers.   Spins, as if fearing invisible intruders."
mortianna,The painted man. He haunts my dreams. GISBORNE Locksley has a companion. A dark- skinned foreigner. He had the marked skin of Islam. Mortianna trembles like an epileptic.    Eyes wide with terror. MORTIANNA Kill them!     Kill them! She throws herself at Nottingham for protection.    He caresses her. Gisborne is thunderstruck. NOTTINGHAM Cousin. Prove to Locksley that your survival was his last mistake.
28.,"CONTINUED: Draws it to his mouth, as if to kiss it... and bites down viciously, drawing blood. The girl screams. NOTTINGHAM Now, my child, Mortianna's kisses will seem soft, like an angel's.  Take her. You have earned her. Mortianna grabs the terrified girl's wrist.   Drags her away. GISBORNE It is madness bringing the hag here."
nottingham,"Fear not for my sanity, Guy. For in madness, there is great power."
29.,"CONTINUED: DUNCAN I know what you're thinking. But one man can achieve nothing against so many. You would need an army. ROBIN Leave me. ASLAN Come, friend. He leads the old man away. CUT TO:"
aslan,"It surprises me that one who curses others so readily has lived so long. DUNCAN I do not recognize the style of your voice, friend. Are you Irish? A Cornishman? ASLAN Er... no. DUNCAN What manner of name is Aslan then? ASLAN A fine Saracen name. "
30.,"CONTINUED: DUNCAN Lord, no! He chokes in shock.   Spitting bread. ASLAN Lord, yes. But eat in peace. I take no offense.  By the prophet! What is the man doing? Robin raises his dagger over his wrist.   Aslan runs to him."
aslan,Wait! Too late. Robin slashes the dagger across his palm. Rain and blood mingle. Streaming onto the grave. ROBIN I swear by my own blood. I will not rest until I have restored my father's name.  ... Or until I am dead.
31.,"CONTINUED: ASLAN No food, no shelter,   and weather that would curse the   end of the earth. We  will all   quickly be dead, and I shall be   rid of my vow. They approach a stone wall, surrounding a thatched mansion. ROBIN You despair too soon, Aslan. We shall find food and shelter here among friends."
aslan,What is this place? ROBIN Peter's home. It is nearly seven years since we left here together.
32.,CONTINUED: ROBIN Is the child Marian at home? OLD WOMAN Maybe she is. Maybe she isn't. Remove that hand. Robin refuses. She waits imperiously behind the locked door. Robin reluctantly withdraws his hand. Instantly the hatch slams. ASLAN The hospitality here is as warm as the weather.
girl,Who are you? Dim lighting.    Robin cannot make out who it is. ROBIN I am Robin of Locksley. GIRL You lie.     Robin is dead. ROBIN I may meet my maker soon from lack of sustenance. But for now I am real enough. 
33.,"CONTINUED: GIRL Step into the light.    Turn around. ROBIN By heaven, am I to dance next? Who are you? GIRL I am the maid Marian. ROBIN Then show yourself, child.     For we knew each other well. GIRL With the king away, these are lawless times. There are outlaws villainous enough to kidnap and ransom a relative of his. ROBIN You know I am not one of them. Besides, I am sworn to protect you. GIRL  Protect me? Robin of Locksley was nothing but a spoiled bully. ROBIN Allow that years of war and prison may change a man. Step forward, Marian, so I may see how you have changed."
34.,"CONTINUED: The sword is jabbed into his back. Robins faces the man -- clad in back, with a metal fighting mask. ROBIN You are truly courageous against an unarmed man. The figure gestures towards the door. Robin sidesteps. Slams an elbow. The sword drops. Slides across the floor. Robin moves for it, but the man intercepts, drawing a dagger. Robin darts to the wall. Rips off an antlered deer head. Defends himself as the attacker slashes at the horns."
outside,The SOUND of the fight indoors.   Aslan hurls himself at the door. It doesn't give.
inside,"Chunks of horn fly. Robin parries and thrusts.     The horns get shorter. Robin retreats. Left with just the nubs, Robin hurls the deer head at the mask. Gaining advantage, he charges. Grabs the dagger hand, smashes it into the wall. The knife drops. Robin wrenches off the mask. Long hair tumbles down... a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN. The front door CAVES IN. Aslan stumbles through... just in time to see the woman's knee fly up into Robin's crotch. Robin folds. The battle is over. The young woman stands over Robin. YOUNG WOMAN As she was saying, we have no need of your protection. Robin croaks through clenched teeth. ROBIN Marian. CUT TO:"
35.,"CONTINUED: The fat girl, SARAH, who pretended to be Marian, serves. Flashes a lusty smile at Aslan, who glances at Robin -- ""Help!"" Marian arrives. In a gown. Stunning. An impish grin. MARIAN I trust Lord Locksley has recovered from his indisposition. Aslan laughs.   Robin glares."
marian,"I will forward your condolences to my mother. She turns her back.   He searches for a way to reach her. ROBIN On my return, I found my father dead. The Sheriff denounced him as a Druid and took our lands. MARIAN The people fear the Druids so much they'd believe anything. Nottingham would have me burned at the stake as a witch if he thought he could possess my property. "
36.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN Why do you not join your mother in London? You would be safer there. MARIAN I will not retreat.     Besides, I have no interest in    life at court. Gossip-mongering and    currying favor. Here I am my     own person. ROBIN The you must allow me to be your guardian."
marian,"I do not need a guardian. She turns to face him.   Streaming tears. MARIAN My brother is dead. You cannot take his place. Robin grabs and holds her. ROBIN Marian, I don't want to replace him. MARIAN What do you want? Their eyes meet... a sudden intimacy between them. Robin moves closer. Marian begins to respond, then pulls away."
marian,This is wrong. She runs back to the house. Robin stares after her. Aslan appears in the doorway with Duncan. ASLAN Robin! The old man hears horses. Approaching fast. He runs to a bluff... a column of soldiers snakes up the hillside. ASLAN Twenty or more. In battle armor. MARIAN Soldiers coming here?     Is this your protection? 
37.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN I killed some of the Sheriff's men. I fear I have placed you in danger. MARIAN I can take care of myself. There are horses in the stable. Go! Aslan runs into the stables. ROBIN I'm not leaving. Marian ices him with a glare. Aslan reappears, with two bareback horses. Soldiers appear on the crest, led by Gisborne... With a mischievous grin, Marian runs to the soldiers. MARIAN Stop them!   They're stealing my horses! ROBIN Damn the girl! Aslan, can you ride? In answer, Aslan grins. Leaps onto a horse. With a single swift move he hoists Duncan up behind him and digs in his heels. The mare leaps forward, and over the estate wall. ROBIN He can ride. He heads his horse at the wall. It stumbles. Barely clears it. Stones fly. Robin struggles to hold on. Marian stands directly in Gisborne's path. GISBORNE You have been sheltering outlaws, Lady Marian. MARIAN They're thieves, you imbecile. Bring back my horses, or the Sheriff will know of your cowardice. Gisborne knows she is lying. "
38.,"CONTINUED: GISBORNE You're lucky he didn't steal your virtue too.  A crown to the man who brings me Locksley's head. He leads the pursuit.   A SOLDIER hangs back.   Grabs Marian's hair. SOLDIER A kiss for me, Saxon bitch. MARIAN Kiss this!"
39.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN Of course I've had a woman! Come on, pretty one. He pats the horse soothingly.    The animal edges forward. ASLAN Softly.   With your knees. ROBIN I know!   I know! The soldiers reload.   Robin urges the horse at the steep drop."
robin,"Easy, easy. Another wave of crossbow bolts. Robin launches the frightened animal into space. Hooves flail... touch down. Scramble up the other bank. Robin enthusiastically pats the horse's neck. ROBIN I love you! The first two pursuers misjudge their leaps.     Their mounts land sprawling in the riverbed. GISBORNE  Robin of the Hood! Son of the devil worshipper. ROBIN What is your pleasure, Gisborne?"
gisborne,"It was I who strung your father's corpse to the castle gate. My pleasure will be in doing the same to you. ROBIN You survived one meeting.    Our next will be your last. GISBORNE Your father died a coward, cursing your name and squealing like a stuck pig. ROBIN That's a lie! "
40.,"CONTINUED: Incensed, he is losing his judgement. ASLAN  Come, Robin! He is trying to anger you into a trap. A shaft pierces the flank of Robin's horse. It rears in fright. Robin clings on. Six soldiers, the men Gisborne split off, are climbing the embankment towards him. Robin regains control. Rides right at them. Scatters them, and takes off again. Gisborne yells at his men to follow."
scope pov,Through the scope we see the movement on the hill behind them.
scope pov,The soldiers are close!
41.,CONTINUED: ROBIN Is this Arab magic? ASLAN No.    Arab science. He replaces the tube in his pouch. ASLAN How did your uneducated kind ever take Jerusalem? ROBIN God knows!
42.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN Be quiet!    Listen. WIND GUSTS the trees in angry waves. Emits deathly SHRIEKS. The HORSES WHINNEY. Unnerved, Aslan smites around him with his scimitar. Wheels at the sounds, striking only air. ASLAN Allah protect us from the evil spirits. Duncan clings to his back.   Robin points. ROBIN Behind you! Aslan slashes out, futilely. ROBIN No, there!    And there! Aslan flails.   Robin cracks up. ASLAN Cease your mad laughing.     I can feel them. Robin reaches into the branches. Pulls out a string of hollowed wooden tubes -- WINDCHIMES. Dozens of such strings on all the trees. He blows over the hollow end. A low chilling MOAN. ROBIN Here are your ghosts, Duncan. A child's toy put to good use. You scare easily, my painted Saladin. His laughter is broken by a piercing YELL. A red- jacketed figure swings down out of a tree on a rope. Catapults him to the ground. The bushes are instantly alive. Shaggy, wild-eyed men, armed with cudgels, scythes and hayforks. Twelfth- century Hell's Angels. The red-jacketed young turk, WILL SCARLET, leaps around Robin. WILL SCARLET "
43.,"CONTINUED: The woodsmen eye the bizarre stranger, keeping their distance from him. Will kicks at Robin, who tries to grab him. Will skips out of range. Robin falls. WILL SCARLET Atishoo, Atishoo. We all fall down. Beg for mercy, rich man. ROBIN I beg of no man. Which of you scum has guts enough to face me man to man? VOICE  Yeah, bollocks, mate."
44.,"CONTINUED: WILL SCARLET A man who travels with two servants and claims he's without money, is either a fool or a liar. Grabbing Robin, Little shakes him like a doll. Something CLINKS. Robin's father's medallion. Laughing heartily, Little rips it from Robin's neck and tosses it to Scarlet. WILL SCARLET And this one is a liar. "
45.,"CONTINUED: WULF Be careful, Father. He fights like a demon. He walloped six o' Sheriff's men? JOHN LITTLE Is that so? Another grin. Licking his lips in anticipation, he lunges for Robin's wrist. Wrenches the sword free. Bends it into a pretzel. ROBIN Aslan!"
aslan,"You seemed more in danger of losing your pride than your life. DUNCAN I recognized some of the voices. Many were from your father's farms. ASLAN Your avenging army, my friend. ROBIN That rabble? ASLAN All they need is a leader. "
46.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN They have a leader.   A very large one. ASLAN Defeat him and they will follow you. ROBIN Allah has taken your brains. DUNCAN I hear the voice of a spoiled child, Master Robin. I suggest you cease your brave talk of revenge and flee to the north. ROBIN You, too? You expect me to fight that behemoth? DUNCAN Your father would expect you to act like a man. CUT TO: EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY A large tree trunk spans a swift-flowing river. The ragged band of woodsmen approach the makeshift bridge. Stop in their tracks. Robin stands on the bridge, brandishing a long wooden staff. ROBIN This is my bridge. No one crosses without paying tax. JOHN LITTLE Just bugger off, mate, huh? ROBIN If you wish to cross, it will cost you a gold medallion. JOHN LITTLE Ain't I hurt you a bloody nuff for one day? WILL SCARLET If he's in a hurry to end his mortal misery, help him. "
47.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN You don't have the courage to face me again, John Little? Or should I call you 'Little John'? John grabs a hefty, gnarled staff.   Strides to the bridge. JOHN LITTLE Alright, m'old cock. You wanna nuther good wallopin'? His confidence melting, Robin glances back at Duncan and Aslan, who grins like a fan at a boxing match. John storms at Robin. Staffs thrash. Driven back, Robin connects a blow on John's foot. The giant is off-balance. Robin follows up. Lands a couple to the ribs. John responds with heavy swings, which Robin blocks deftly. Back and forth, blow for blow, all blocked. John chuckles with every swing. Enjoying the time of his life. Their staffs lock. It's strength against strength. Robin is no match. With one mighty thrust, John hurtles him into the stream. The woodsmen cheer loudly. Aslan watches impassively. Robin scrambles back onto the bridge.   John waits, grinning. JOHN LITTLE Lil' wet behind the ears, mate? WILL SCARLET Don't fool with him. Get him!"
48.,CONTINUED: JOHN LITTLE Bloomin' shame. 'E were a brave 'un. Suddenly Robin arcs up out of the water. His hands clamp onto John's ankles. Robin heaves with all his might. John topples headfirst into the water. Surfaces in panic. JOHN LITTLE Help!   Cain't bloody swim. He submerges again.   Robin pulls his head above water. ROBIN Do you yield?
49.,CONTINUED: ROBIN 
50.,"CONTINUED: LITTLE JOHN This stumpy one 'ere's David o' Doncaster. We calls 'im Bull. ROBIN How do you come by the name, Bull? BULL 'Cuz o' my size, Sire. ROBIN Because you are short? BULL Nay.   'Cuz I be so long."
51.,"CONTINUED: LITTLE JOHN We're outlaws. Got prices on our 'eads, every man jack. Blasted Sheriff says we owes 'im taxes. ROBIN How do you fare? LITTLE JOHN We get by, I reckon. ROBIN While the Sheriff steals your land and your families starve?"
little john,"What in bloody blazes'd ya have us do? ROBIN Your ghosts will only keep his men at bay so long, my friend. Soon the Sheriff will hunt you down and hang you. You must fight back. LITTLE JOHN We show as much as a toe outside the forest, they'll slaughter us like bleedin' sheep. ROBIN We must organize. Win by guile. LITTLE JOHN 'We'? Ya lookin' to join us, matie? ROBIN No.   To lead you. WILL SCARLET Ha! I would never be led by the son of a Druid. ROBIN There are many here who knew my father to be a kind and generous man. I doubt that in their hearts they believe him capable of such a horror. Murmurs of agreement from around the fire.    Robin turns to Will. "
robin,"He is right to distrust me. I am a rich man's son. I have done no honest labor. But today I am as poor as any of you. Nottingham has stolen all that I own. And when I killed Gisborne's men, I, too, became an outlaw. LITTLE JOHN Ya're full o'bloody wind an' all, mate. This 'ere load o' rubbish agin the Sheriff's bloomin' army? Ya must be bloody jokin'. ROBIN We can win.   And I believe we will. LITTLE JOHN Ya're a daft bugger, Robin Hood, but ya're a brave 'un, I'll give ya that. Drink up, laddie, cuz tomorrow ya mayn't be so lucky! Tomorrow I shall best ya an' crack that blasted noble head in two. Laughing loudly, he throws back his head for a long draught of mead."
53.,"CONTINUED: ASLAN  I have led you wrong. This is no army. These men live like dogs. ROBIN English dogs.    They can learn. ASLAN Learn what?   To build kennels? He sullenly stalks away. Robin shakes his head. Aslan is right. He rouses Duncan, who is asleep at his side. The old man groans awake, holding his head. Seriously hung-over."
robin,"Too much mead, old friend.    What day is it? DUNCAN Sunday, I believe. ROBIN Good. Do they still give alms to the poor at the mass? DUNCAN They do. These days the need for mercy is greater than ever. ROBIN Then I must ask you a favor. EXT. ROAD TO NOTTINGHAM - DAY"
54.,"CONTINUED: GUARD Do I know you? Robin gazes into space, trying to look blind.   The Guard sniffs his soiled hand. GUARD My God, you stink! ROBIN Pardon my blindness, sir.    I'm always falling down. GUARD Yeech!   Get away from me."
55.,"CONTINUED: VARIOUS 1.   Alms! 2.   Have mercy, milady. 3.   Pity, fine sir. 4.   For my baby. 5.   Etc. The rich drop a few mites, sparking a mad scramble. Church officials roughly keep order. Marian passes some coins to the mother of a small child. A hand grabs her wrist. ROBIN Alms for a blind man. For one who cannot see your beauty."
marian," This is dangerous. ROBIN So you care for my safety? MARIAN No, for mine. I do not wish to be seen with an outlaw. ROBIN Under the Sheriff's law, that's a badge of pride. MARIAN He's put a price on your head. ROBIN How much?"
marian,A hundred gold pieces. ROBIN Is that all? I have not annoyed him enough. Soon he will offer ten thousand. MARIAN For ten thousand I would turn you in myself. 
56.,"CONTINUED: MARIAN He has rounded up every blacksmith in the county. He has them holed up in the castle making swords and armor. ROBIN What is he planning? MARIAN I don't know, but there's no limit to the man's ambitions.  Go!"
robin,"If you need me, I will be with the woodsmen. Send for me as 'Robin Hood.' MARIAN Robin!   Do something for me. ROBIN What? MARIAN Take a bath. ROBIN Care to join me? With a grin, he slips into the crowd as Nottingham arrives."
nottingham,"You shine like the sun, my lady. He raises her hand, as he did the girl's in the castle. Kisses it. NOTTINGHAM You have been meeting with young Robin of Locksley. "
57.,"CONTINUED: NOTTINGHAM I deeply regret it, and I promise you he will be brought to justice. For subjecting you to such treatment, I will hang him from the walls with his own entrails. That gleam of insanity.   Robin watches from a distance. MARIAN I would like to see that, my lord. The Sheriff places his hand possessively on her shoulder. NOTTINGHAM My dear, a woman of your refinement is not safe living alone. If you would consent to bring your household within the city walls, I could give your needs my most personal attention. MARIAN I thank you, Lord Nottingham, from the heart, but for now I prefer to stay in my family's ancestral home. My cousin, King Richard, will be deeply moved to hear of your concern for my welfare. NOTTINGHAM Alas, the King has many enemies both abroad and at home. I fear for his safe return. MARIAN Fear not, my dear Sheriff. He will return. When he does, he will wish to reward his faithful subjects. The Sheriff smiles sourly and takes his leave. Marian deflates with relief. The Sheriff walks alone towards a side door. BEGGAR "
58.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN A hundred crowns, Sheriff?   You insult me. Nottingham starts to struggle.   Robin draws blood. ROBIN Remember young Robin of Locksley, Sheriff? Meet Robin Hood. Your nemesis. Your avenging angel. NOTTINGHAM If you kill me, you will hang. ROBIN If I kill you, I will hang happy. NOTTINGHAM What do you want? ROBIN I want to give you a chance. A chance you do not deserve. A chance to right your wrongs. NOTTINGHAM I'm listening. ROBIN From this day forward you will cease to tax my people. You will renounce the charges against my father, and you will return his lands to me. NOTTINGHAM Why should I? ROBIN Because for every harm you do, I swear by God I shall visit on you threefold in return. NOTTINGHAM Empty words. ROBIN I am here with a blade at your throat. As long as I live, you will always know that I could be here again. A YELL from across the church. Gisborne has spotted them. Robin digs the knife a little deeper. "
59.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN Your answer? NOTTINGHAM Never, fool. ROBIN Then it will begin.. Gisborne yells orders.   Robin hurls Nottingham against the wall."
robin,A personal loan from the Sheriff. ASLAN 
60.,"CONTINUED: ASLAN A foolish risk. If you had been killed, I would be cursed for eternity for failing to fulfil my pledge. ROBIN Aslan, if I didn't know better, I would swear you were worried about me."
nottingham,Starve them out. Slaughter their livestock. I want to see Locksley's own people fighting each other to bring him to us. GISBORNE I swear he will not live to see the next full moon.
61.,"CONTINUED: Wulf runs to greet his mother and siblings.    A contingent of woodsmen confronts Robin. WILL SCARLET You brought this misery on us, Locksley. We can barely feed ourselves. LITTLE JOHN Sheriff hasn't left us a bloody pot to piss in. ROBIN Then we shall take from him and his rich friends."
62.,"EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP - DAY  I am ready, Will. Will bends, as if checking the horse's legs. Secretly grabs a handful of sand. Swings into the saddle and digs in his heels. Closing in, Will flings the sand in Robin's eyes. Robin clutches his hands to his face, blinded. Will spins back to the attack. His sword slashes. Reacting to the sound, Robin rolls aside. The men cheer like a big fight crowd."
63.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN Come on, you little piss pot. Do your worst! Will grabs a spear from a bystander. Robin stands his ground. Will lunges, Robin sidesteps. ROBIN The horse is smarter than you are, Will. Some of the men laugh. Will is incensed. Robin ducks and weaves, easily evading Will's repeated charges. Robin ducks right under the horse's belly."
robin,"Here, Will!   You aim like a girl, Will! Will stabs wildly, more and more frustrated. Laughter spreads, as Robin plays hide and seek around the horse's legs. Grabbing the end of the spear, he clowns a tug of war. Enraged, Will strains and tries to kick Robin away. Suddenly, Robin lets go. Unbalanced, Will flies back- wards off his mount. Robin snatches the spear and raises it over his fallen adversary. The crowd falls silent. Robin strikes. The point quivers in the ground below Will's crotch. Will wriggles in terror. Impaled, his pants rip open. ROBIN Thank the Lord you are not endowed like Bull."
64.,CONTINUED: Robin scans the faces.     He has their attention. ROBIN Nottingham has taken from us everything we own. Now we are going to start taking from him. LITTLE JOHN 'Ow in bloody blazes are we gonna do that? ROBIN We are going to tax him. DISSOLVE TO:
scope pov,"A phalanx of   mounted soldiers, a cart loaded with barrels, and   a tax wagon. The wagon is an armored box on wheels, with   crossbow slits in the side. Guy of Gisborne commands the   escort. BACK TO SCENE ROBIN This is no ordinary convoy. Bull calls up from below, where a ragged group of woods- men lies nervously in ambush. BULL 'ow many? "
65.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN Er, about ten.  Why scare them? They can't count anyway. ASLAN And they call me the barbarian. ROBIN Let's go. Together they run down the hill, keeping low. Gisborne eyes the forest. The beer cart is steered by a fat red-faced FRIAR, raucously singing hymns and quaffing from a jug, which he repeatedly dips into one of the barrels. ARROWS WHISTLE in. The Friar yells and drops his jug. A soldier is hit. At the forest edge, four woodsmen reload their longbows. Dressed in green, their faces camouflaged. The mounted soldiers charge them. The  woodsmen run into the trees. As the horsemen close in,  the runners leap into a trench. Lift up matted screens  of brush and grass. It's as if they disappeared.   The soldiers slash wildly at the thick screens. More arrows fly. More soldiers fall. The others spin in confusion, trying to discern the enemy. More woods- men break from cover. Run down a narrow path. Gisborne urges his men to pursue. They ride in single file, beating their way through the tangled branches."
66.,"CONTINUED: Gisborne races back to the road... the wagons are gone. He rides frantically back and forth. Searching and cursing. EXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY Robin climbs onto the tax wagon's roof.     Angry shouts from inside. ROBIN Surrender your weapons. I give you my word you shall go free. In answer, a swordblade jabs up through the roof, near his feet."
robin,"Ah, I feared as much. He signals to Aslan, who steers the tax wagon into the river. Water floods in through the slits. Inside, panic. Drowning rats. The bowmen scramble out. What they see stops them dead. Both banks are men in green, longbows aimed directly at them. CUT TO: COUNTRYSIDE Sparks. An axe pounds into the lock of a strongbox. The lock snaps. Little John pries open the lid. Reacts in astonishment. The trunk is filled to the brim with glittering gold coins. The woodsmen press around. Cheers of celebration."
67.,"CONTINUED: FRIAR The Lord's blessing on you, kind sir. These sinners were attempting to steal these libations destined for the monks of St. Catherine's. He indicates his cargo of barrels. ROBIN It appears to me, Reverend Friar, that many of the libations have found their way into your own esteemed person. Ignoring him, the Friar mounts the cart."
friar,"A thousand pardons, sir, but duty beckons. I must hasten on. ROBIN "
68.,"CONTINUED: FRIAR ... you must best me for it. Robin staggers. The Friar whips up the horse. Dazed, Robin grabs for the fat man's leg. Gets a holy sandal full in the face. FRIAR Giddyup, nag! The Friar's horse, as obese as his driver, slowly raises his head from the grass and ambles forward. Robin runs after them and dives at the Friar, toppling him from the cart."
robin,"You leave when I say. Scrambling to his feet, the Friar glances skyward. FRIAR Protect me, Lord. He sweeps his foot, knocking Robin's legs out from under him. Hurls his full body weight on top of him. Whooomf! FRIAR Yield! He bounces on Robin's stomach. Robin can barely breathe. The woodsmen are enjoying the spectacle. FRIAR Confess that Friar Tuck is a better, holier, and braver man than thou art, knave."
robin,"Never!   Whoomf! FRIAR Yield, I say!    Yield to Friar Tuck. Desperate, Robin bites the Friar's leg. Tuck howls. Robin extricates himself, grabs for a weapon. Smashes the Friar's head with his drinking jug. ROBIN Yield yourself! He dives onto the Friar and hammers his head into the ground. "
69.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN Yield to Robin Hood. Tuck holds up a hand in surrender.    Robin eases off. FRIAR  Thank you, Lord, for teaching me humility. ROBIN Well, Friar Tuck. We have need of an honest man of God, to minister to these men and their families. What do you say?"
friar tuck,"strapped into the traces, pulls the beer cart. Sweating profusely, grunting with strain. His horse contentedly follows. ROBIN Giddyup, Friar."
70.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN You will not regret it. FRIAR Aye, but you may. CUT TO: EXT. WOODSMEN'S CAMP A blazing fire. Deer carcasses roast. Tuck's barrels supply the refreshment. Robin and Aslan pass out coins to each family. ROBIN Buy yourself a new son, Stephen. FARMER Thankee, Robin. Little John and Bull approach. John indicates the two prisoners roped to a nearby tree. LITTLE JOHN Cain't get a bleedin' squeak outa 'em, Rob. BULL They'd be spittin' it out good if they'd knowed anythin'. LITTLE JOHN Reckon the Cap'n knows summat, Rob, but stubborn ol' cocker 'e is. ASLAN Perhaps it is time for some heathen persuasion. CUT TO: CAPTAIN OF SOLDIERS stares up at Robin defiantly. CAPTAIN Spare your breath. I know nothing. ROBIN "
71.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN  And when he gets like this, he's very hard to reason with. With a hair-raising war cry, Aslan   leaps INTO VIEW. Stripped to the waist, brandishing   his scimitar. The Captain tries to back away. Robin    tries to restrain Aslan, is hurled aside. Snarling,    drooling at the mouth, Aslan explores the Captain's body   with his hands. A butcher checking meat. ROBIN I strongly advise you to talk. He hasn't eaten in weeks."
captain," No, Aslan... not this one, Aslan. ... How about this other one?... Fatter, yes... more meat. The other soldier, who definitely  has more flesh on the bone, is struck dumb with horror,  as Aslan turns his attention to him. With one swing   of his sword, Aslan slices through the man's ropes.   Drags him to his feet. Little John runs over."
72.,"CONTINUED: The demented Arab slowly reappears. Blood drips from his lips. He munches the flesh from a long bone, on the end of which is the soldier's glove... the man's arm. Turning to Robin, Aslan shouts in Arabic and gesticulates wildly at the Captain. CAPTAIN What does he say? ROBIN Well, roughly, he says that he doesn't care for the way your friend tastes, and he wants you. CAPTAIN No, God, no! I'll talk. Just keep him away. Keep him away!"
behind wagon,"Bull holds the other prisoner, muffling the man's mouth and trying to suppress his own laughter. Beside them lies a large chunk of venison. The man is unharmed, except that he's missing a glove."
73.,"CONTINUED: LITTLE JOHN Aye, the Romans built a bleedin' great wall to keep 'em out. BULL What does 'e want wi 'em? ROBIN Since he also has every Smith in the country working in his castle, we can assume he is planning a little war. LITTLE JOHN Agin' who?"
aslan,England.
nottingham,"Spanish steel, cousin. So much stronger than our native blades. Any losses? GISBORNE All the men are gone. NOTTINGHAM Yet again you are the sole survivor, cousin? Interesting. And the gold? GISBORNE Well, it er... disappeared. "
74.,"CONTINUED: The Sheriff looks at Gisborne for the first time. NOTTINGHAM Robin Hood? GISBORNE They were woodsmen, dressed in green. NOTTINGHAM Robin Hood. He places a hand reassuringly on his cousin's shoulder. NOTTINGHAM Cousin, we must be strong. We cannot allow this outlaw to make fools of us. Without warning, he drives the blade into Gisborne's belly. NOTTINGHAM And I cannot allow a lieutenant to fail me.  It is indeed fine steel."
75.,"CONTINUED: Laughter. The procession passes two of the Sheriff's mounted soldiers. They glumly watch as Tuck raises his jug in greeting. FRIAR Good morrow, brothers."
76.,"CONTINUED: He wades bare-ass naked out of the water towards her. She casts a contemptuous look over his muscled body, glistening with water. MARIAN How dare you expose yourself to me?! She slugs him. Robin stumbles backwards into the water. Bull grins, gesturing to Sarah and pointing to his own black eye. BULL The big 'un did the same to me."
77.,"CONTINUED: MARIAN Do you think he's going to let you get away with all this? The man is without mercy. He will annihilate you. ROBIN Somebody has to take a stand. MARIAN You're taking a stand with the lives of these people. These young ones. A beat. She checks the faces. Her eyes meet Robin's. Is there a hint of concern for him also? MARIAN What do you want from me? ROBIN Nottingham was sending this gold to buy reinforcements from the Celtic tribesmen. We need to warn King Richard. MARIAN Nottingham would not dare challenge the King. ROBIN The King is not in England to be challenged, is he? While he is away, he may lose his country.  You are Richard's cousin. You can get word to him. He would believe you. MARIAN Now you want me to participate in your folly? A little girl approaches, holding a bouquet of wild flowers. Touched, Marian kneels to accept the offering. CUT TO:"
bouquet,"protrudes from Marian's saddle. She is mounted, ready to go. Sarah giggles as she takes her leave of Bull. "
78.,CONTINUED: ROBIN  Will you send word to the King? MARIAN I'll think about it.
79.,"CONTINUED: MARIAN You will travel to France immediately. You must give this directly into the hands of the King, and him alone. The courier bows in acknowledgement.    Marian indicates Sarah. MARIAN My lady-in-waiting will accompany you. Surprised, the courier glances at the Bishop."
bishop,"My dear, I could not vouch for her safety. The journey is fraught with danger. MARIAN I appreciate your concern, my Lord, but Sarah is an accomplished rider. I must insist that she goes along. BISHOP  As you wish."
robin,"We have to be ready to move camp at any time. The only way we can be attacked is from the Nottingham Road. We hide lookouts in the trees, here and here. If they see soldiers, they shoot warning arrows. Whistles by day, fire by night. Wulf runs up to Little John in panic. WULF Father!   Come quick.   Mother's dying."
80.,"INT. WOODSMEN'S HUT - DAY Fanny Little writhes in agony.    John rushes in.   Tuck looks up from Fanny's side. FRIAR The child comes early. Fanny screams.   John kneels beside her, taking her head. LITTLE JOHN Hush, m'lass.    Ya'll be fine. FANNY 'S not like t'others, John.    Oh God, it pains me so."
little john," Ya're sittin' thar like a fat sow. Help her, man, help her! FRIAR I am doing all I can. Aslan appears in the doorway, with Robin. Whips back the blanket. Fanny's chest is covered with black squirming creatures. ASLAN By Allah, leeches! He starts to pull the parasites off.    Tuck jumps at him. FRIAR Get away from her! Aslan pushes him away, continuing his work."
aslan,"Blood is like air. If she loses blood, she and the child will die. John is paralyzed with confusion.    Tuck appeals to Robin. FRIAR He lies. He is the devil's seed, sent to lead us astray. ASLAN Fool, both the Bible and the Koran instruct us to preserve life. Tuck raises an arm to strike Aslan. Robin blocks the blow. Aslan gently touches the mother's stomach. "
81.,"CONTINUED: ASLAN  If you will allow me, I can help her. It will not be without danger."
friar,"Do not listen to him!   He will kill her. ASLAN If you do not listen to me, she will certainly die. And the child, too. Fanny cries out.   John looks to Robin, pleading for advice. ROBIN The good Friar has done all he can. I suggest you let the Arab try.  If I am wrong, and they die, then you may take my life."
82.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN What are you going to do? ASLAN The child must be taken out by the knife. ROBIN The knife? ASLAN I have seen it many times with horses. ROBIN Horses? By the Lord, what are her chances? ASLAN After wasting so much blood... not good. ROBIN Now you tell me! Wulf runs back in.     Aslan holds up a piece of wood. ASLAN  Are you ready?... Bite down on this... Robin, hold her steady. He lifts the red-hot knife from the ashes."
inside,"The mother heaves, then drops. ROBIN Is she gone? "
83.,"CONTINUED: Aslan ignores him, keeps working over Fanny's body. Robin cannot watch... a WAIL! Aslan mutters something in awed Arabic. ROBIN What did you say? Aslan holds up a bloody struggling infant. ASLAN It is a boy. The mother revives.   Aslan places the child on her breast."
aslan,"Your son, my lady... Robin, hold her skin together while I sew her up. He picks up the needle and thread.   Robin's eyes turn to the woman's abdomen... He faints. CUT TO:"
little john,"marches among the cheering families, holding his newborn child high for all to see. Tuck sits miserably to one side. Bloody and  exhausted, Aslan appears at the hut door. Tuck jumps  to his feet, drawing his knife. Heads turn. Tense silence. Robin appears, unsteadily, behind Aslan. Watches, ready to intervene. Tuck stares at Aslan. Raises his blade... and slices down across his own wrist. FRIAR This day God has taught me a fine lesson. He hands Aslan the knife and extends his bloodied wrist. FRIAR I would be honored. Aslan slices his own wrist. The two wrists clasp together in the universal sign of brotherhood. Everyone cheers. FRIAR You are a good man, my barbarian friend. "
84.,"CONTINUED: FRIAR  We shall open a barrel together and I shall do my damndest to save your heathen soul. ASLAN Alas, I am not permitted... FRIAR Our God made this brew, brother. I merely combined the ingredients. Do you dare to insult his works?"
marian,Who is there?     Duncan!
85.,"CONTINUED: SOLDIER We meet again. He reveals a large scar on his wrist -- removes his mask -- the man who attacked her earlier. He prods her with his sword. SOLDIER Drop your blade. MARIAN You are still overmatched, soldier. She drops the sword. He hurls her against the table. Lays his blade against her chest."
soldier,"You owe me favors, wench. Bare your breasts... or I will do it for you. Resignedly, she raises a hand to loosen the string on her dress. With the other hand she reaches behind her, grabs a pepper bowl. Flips the contents into his face. Screaming, he grabs his  face. She reaches for her dagger. He slashes with   his sword. She backs to the fireplace, grabs a spit  of roasted chickens... drives the point clean through  his chest. He stares in shock at his own blood pouring from the cooked fowls pinned to his breast... FOOTSTEPS... masked soldiers converge from both sides of the house, dragging the servants. Duncan  is shoved through the door. DUNCAN I am sorry, my lady.    There were too many. She stares at the invaders with studied calm. MARIAN Is there something you need, gentlemen? I remember no masked ball on my calendar. CUT TO:"
aerial shot,"FLYING LOW OVER treetops, OVER an expanse of green, intersected by brown roads and tracks. We are LOOKING AT a detailed scale model of Sherwood Forest in..."
86.,INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - NIGHT The Sheriff and SIX BARONS are gathered around the model. These are the men who revealed their faces to Lord Locksley in the Druid ceremony. Nottingham toys with a white rat on his arm. REDHEAD BARON Forget about Locksley. He is no threat. NOTTINGHAM How can we control all England if we cannot control our own county? The people are turning him into a hero.
greybeard baron,It is impossible to attack him in the forest. We have tried everything. He is cunning. NOTTINGHAM Then we   will be more cunning. I must be   rid of him. We may not be able   to intercept his next warning   to the King. Sounds of COMMOTION outside. The door swings open. Framed in the doorway is a colossus in black armor. His helmet is the head of a dragon. He slowly raises the visor. Deep tribal scars on his cheeks. Implacable ferocity in his eyes. CELTIC CHIEFTAIN I want the heads of the men who stole my gold.
nottingham,"Welcome, sir. We were discussing how to rid ourselves of those very men. The outlaws who band with Robin Hood. REDHEAD BARON My Lord Nottingham, I must protest. It is a mistake to ally ourselves with foreigners. GREYBEARD BARON What can these Celts do that we cannot? "
87.,"CONTINUED: The Chieftain strides across to the fire. Grabs a burning log. The Baron backs away in fear. The log spits sparks as the Chieftain raises it above his head... and drives it into his own palm. He stares unblinking at the Baron, holding the log to his hand for a full three seconds. An awed silence. Nottingham grins, delighted with the demonstration. He deposits his white rat onto the model. NOTTINGHAM This rat Hood has hidden out in the forest.  He resists all our assaults with traps and devices, while he robs us blind. We must bring him out and destroy him. The rat has scurried into the shelter of the model trees. The Chieftain watches impassively, then calmly touches the log to the model. The trees ignite... the RAT SQUEALS in terror and runs. The Chieftain cuts off its escape, setting fire to more trees... again... and again. The Sheriff watches the flames, fascinated. DISSOLVE TO:"
88.,CONTINUED: FRIAR How can these Arabs hold Jerusalem when they can't even hold their brew? DISSOLVE TO:
90.,"CONTINUED: He runs forward. Turns the body over. Skin chalk-white from loss of blood... Sarah! A shadow falls across Robin. Before he can react, a cudgel stuns him into blackness."
91.,CONTINUED: MARIAN Because you love me. Say it. You love me. 
92.,"CONTINUED: Bull joins the fray, charging like his namesake, howling in rage, flailing at heads with his quarterstaff. Wulf stays in the mouth, picking off men with deadly accuracy. A furious melee. Bull and Aslan mow down the enemy like hay, battling far superior odds. Soon they are the only two left standing. Bull peers cautiously into the dark- ness. Behind him, one of his victims crawls back to his feet... and lunges. ASLAN Behind you! Too late. A sword is driven through Bull's gut. Aslan grabs the attacker by the neck and pile-drives him into the cave wall. The man's SKULL CRACKS against the rocks. Aslan runs to Robin's side, as Wulf hurries to Bull's. Robin is slumped against a rock. ROBIN  Marian? Aslan runs to the back of the cave, searching. Wulf is crouched beside Bull, who murmurs his dying words. BULL Ya be sure Sarah gits a Christian burial. Promise me, boy. WULF I promise. Aslan stumbles at the edge of a deep crevasse. Far be- low he sees Mortianna, clambering down the steep rock. For a second their eyes meet. She hisses -- venom, hatred, fear -- then is gone."
93.,CONTINUED: ASLAN It worked for me this very morning.  You will thank me for this later.
94.,"EXT. SHERWOOD FOREST - DAY Fire.   Blazing rampant. Along a hillside are hundreds of crossbowmen with fire arrows. At a shouted order, another wave of flaming arrows ignites the trees. Behind the crossbowmen are two figures on horseback. One is the Sheriff, in full armor. The other is the black-clad Celtic chieftain. He sits as still as a rock."
95.,CONTINUED: HAL C... cccc... LITTLE JOHN C... ccc? What the bloody hell ya sayin'? Cows?... Cowards?... HAL Cccc... elts! WILL SCARLET Celts?   Where? HAL  Gggg... God help us.
96.,"CONTINUED: LITTLE JOHN Stop 'ere and flippin' well fight 'em, that's what. Whadya say, lads? Half-hearted support from about a dozen men, including Tack. LITTLE JOHN Nay, reveren'. Ya best be goin' wi' the wenches. FRIAR This holy man believes in doing God's work with his hands."
robin,"What are you doing?    Out of my way! ASLAN I saved your life. I will not let you give it away for no purpose. ROBIN Out of my way, damn you! ASLAN Does the witch still have possession of your senses? If we meet up with the survivors we may yet give them some help. And do some damage to the enemy. "
97.,CONTINUED: Robin debates.   Relents.   They urge their horses into a gallop.
98.,"CONTINUED: Aslan is a   wild man. Steering his horse with just legs and knees,   he strikes out with both swords to left and right. The    momentum is turning. Wulf appears at the edge of the   clearing. Starts picking off stragglers. His father   spots him. LITTLE JOHN Git the bleedin' 'ell outa there, ya li'l bugger. Distracted, he doesn't see a Celt swing at his back... but Wulf's arrow pierces the man's adam's apple. He freezes in mid-air, before toppling at John's feet. When John turns back, Wulf is being dragged away by three of the Sherrif's men. He attempts to pursue, but is intercepted by two more Celts... and struck down. Aslan charges between the two Celts. Slashes down with both swords. Both men topple to the ground simultaneously. Suddenly all is quiet.    The smoking clearing is a mass of fallen bodies. Only    four men seem to be alive. Robin, Aslan, Tuck, who   is slouched against a tree gasping for breath, and   Hal, who kneels clutching his wounded shoulder. Robin dismounts and runs to Little John. Overwhelmed and exhausted, he slumps over the giant's unmoving form. LITTLE JOHN Don't 'ee start bleedin' blubberin', or ya'll make me bloody vomit."
99.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN You were an honor to your countrymen today, Aslan. You fought better than twenty English knights. ASLAN This war is the God of Abraham against the forces of evil. ROBIN Well, the war is over. He stares across the desolate clearing."
robin,There is too much blood on my hands.
100.,"CONTINUED: NOTTINGHAM  You will all be tortured. You will all tell me all you know about Robin Hood, and then you will all be hanged. Then we will catch your beloved Robin Hood and do the same to him. WILL SCARLET I will kill him for you. WULF Will, no! Nottingham strides up to Will, drawing his sword."
nottingham,"Why would I need you? WILL SCARLET All your attempts to kill him have failed. Your army failed. Your Celtic mercenaries failed. Nottingham places his sword point against Will's throat. NOTTINGHAM And you can succeed? WILL SCARLET I am one of his men. He would never suspect me. WULF He knows you always hated him, traitor."
will scarlet,"He is a trusting fool. He will believe me. If he doesn't, he will kill me and you have lost nothing. Nottingham slides his blade between Will's teeth. NOTTINGHAM If you fail, I will personally cut out your lying tongue. He withdraws the blade.    Will tries to smile. WILL SCARLET And if I succeed? "
101.,CONTINUED: NOTTINGHAM His friends will..  ... torture him! He turns back to Will.   A smile of mock apology. NOTTINGHAM It will look better.
aslan,And you? ROBIN I am no longer your responsibility. ASLAN That is for me to decide. ROBIN 
102.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN Damn you, too, Father.   You reared a coward and a fool. He hurls the medallion... it catches on a low-hanging branch. CUT TO:"
november moon,"Watery, full. The FOCUS SHIFTS TO the medallion, dangling in its center... the last thing Robin sees before his eyes close into troubled sleep. The white moon against the black sky... DISSOLVE TO:"
robin's face,"DISTORTED in water. The LAUGHTER BECOMES the sound of a RUNNING RIVER. Robin is washing, trying to drive away the horror. "
103.,"CONTINUED: The first streaks of light fight their way through a thick, morning mist. Out of the mist steps a figure, at first indecipherable. Aware of his presence, Robin looks up. ROBIN Will!    I thought you were taken. WILL SCARLET I was. ROBIN How did you escape? WILL SCARLET I promised to kill you. ROBIN And will you? Before Will can answer, Little John runs up.     Grabs Will's throat. LITTLE JOHN I'll wring yer scrawny neck, Will Scarlet. I'd be doin' yer a bloody favor an' all. Quickly, others arrive. Aslan, Tuck, Hal, Fanny, with kids clinging to her skirts. FANNY Afore ya kill 'im, John, ask 'im if Wulf be still alive. Will is choking, unable to speak. John loosens his hold just enough for Will to splutter out... WILL SCARLET Y... e... LITTLE JOHN Git us a rope, Hal, and we'll put the bleedin' weasel outa 'is misery. ROBIN John, wait.    Let us hear what he has to say. LITTLE JOHN No bugger 'scapes the Sheriff, 'nless 'e's linin' 'is bloomin' pockets. "
104.,CONTINUED: ROBIN A traitor sneaks in and out under cover of darkness. Will walked in and announced himself. LITTLE JOHN  Aye.    'E always did 'ave balls o' brass. HAL Let's sss... string 'im up. ROBIN Let him speak.
fanny,"What about my boy? WILL SCARLET The boy, too.    Ten men in all. Fanny drops her head on John's shoulder. WILL SCARLET Their   deaths are a warning. Anyone   who associates with the outlaw   Hood is to suffer the same fate.    Man, woman, or child. Even anyone   who so much as utters his name. "
105.,"CONTINUED: FRIAR Robin Hood! Robin Hood! Robin Hood!  May as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. WILL SCARLET The hangings are to be part of the celebration for the Sheriff's marriage. LITTLE JOHN Marriage, eh? What lucky wench gits to play with the Sheriff's codpiece? Will turns his gaze directly on Robin. WILL SCARLET Lady Marian. FRIAR He takes a bride of royal blood? LITTLE JOHN Aye, and then with King Richard gone, he takes the bloody throne. Everyone reacts with shock.     Only Robin appears unsur- prised. ROBIN You were to use this news to get close to me, and then kill me? Right, Will?"
106.,"CONTINUED: Robin is on the spot.    All eyes on him.   Will presses his point. WILL SCARLET Will ya stay and keep us fightin' till every man jack of us is dead? Or will you run like the spoiled little rich boy I always took you for? ROBIN You present quite a choice.    What would you have me do, Will? WILL SCARLET If you run, I will kill you. ROBIN And if I stay, will you all stay with me? Robin checks the other faces. ASLAN To the end, friend. FRIAR If my heathen brother stays, I stay. HAL Mmmm... meee... tttt... He can't get it out.    Little John covers Hal's mouth. LITTLE JOHN 'E's in. We're all bloody in. Daft buggers. ROBIN There's your answer, Will.    We finish it."
107.,"INT. DUNGEON - DUSK The sound of the gallows ECHOES inside the damp, stone walls. Wulf and the other woodsmen are chained to rings in the floor. Wulf lifts his eyes to a chink of light high in the wall. The purple sky is turning black. He fingers his wooden crucifix. WULF If it be your biddin' that this be my last night o' life, Lord, gimme the pluck to die proud. An' look 'ee kindly on my folks an' the young 'uns. The light in the cell melts to total darkness."
branches,Sunlight glistens on frost-laden branches.      A COCK ROBIN CHIRPS.
108.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN Will it work? Aslan throws a handful of powder into the firel A fire- ball rips ten feet in the air... Tuck falls on his ass in terror. ROBIN  ... I would surely be one. Robin reaches out and shakes Aslan's hand. A moment of bonding. He moves on to the others, clasping each man's hand as he speaks. ROBIN We have no armored knights, no glorious banners. But I am honored to be going to battle in this company. Today we fight not just for the lives of our friends, but to save all England. A moment of tension before Will takes the proferred hand. ROBIN We may be only six men, but... FANNY Seven!"
109.,"CONTINUED: FANNY You go an' birth eight babies and then you can come an' tell me 'bout hurtin', ya big ox. I ain't gonna sit aroun' an' let one o' 'em die, neither. LITTLE JOHN Ya should be bloody well mindin' the other seven. Tell 'er, Rob. Robin starts to draw a diagram on the ground with a stick. ROBIN Fanny, show me the exact location of the scaffold. Little John double-takes."
110.,"CONTINUED: MARIAN  I will never marry you. Mortianna emerges from a dark corner, bearing the goblet she used at the Druid ceremony. MORTIANNA Hold her! Marian struggles against her bonds. MARIAN Get away from me, you disgusting hag. I will not... augh!"
111.,"CONTINUED: MORTIANNA The blood does not lie. NOTTINGHAM  Tell me how it will result. MORTIANNA I have told you what I know. NOTTINGHAM Confound you, crone. Without my protection, the people would hunt you down, rip out your black heart and burn it."
112.,CONTINUED: GUARD  I'll warrant. Pass.
113.,"CONTINUED: WILL SCARLET I want your word, in front of these witnesses. If I tell you, I will go free. NOTTINGHAM  We will find him. WILL SCARLET He is concealed. He is going to free the prisoners and stop the wedding. Nottingham's jaw tightens.   Eyes the prisoners, the scaffold. NOTTINGHAM Put Hood in my hands, you go free. WILL SCARLET With the reward. Ten thousand crowns. NOTTINGHAM Damn your worthless hide!    Just tell me where he is. WILL SCARLET The reward! The parade of prisoners reaches them. Seeing Will, Wulf charges at him, screaming in blind rage. Soldiers grab Wulf. Throw him down, kicking and beating. Voices in the crowd plead to let him be. Someone tries to intervene, gets hurled down."
nottingham, You'll get your reward. Where is he? CUT TO:
114.,"CONTINUED: Across the square, Will points urgently in Tuck's direction."
nottingham,"Step down, friar. FRIAR As you wish, sire. Is there something amiss? NOTTINGHAM This man claims you have outlaws concealed in these barrels. Among them the cursed Robin Hood. Tuck glares at Will with unconcealed hatred. FRIAR This man will rot in hell as a knave and a liar. These are libations for the celebration of your lordship's nuptials. "
115.,"CONTINUED: NOTTINGHAM Break one open! FRIAR  Why waste fine vintage, my lord? A cask is shattered... wine torrents out. WILL SCARLET Try another. There are many barrels, only a few outlaws. A drum roll. The Sheriff's attention turns to the scaffold, where the first victim is escorted up the steps -- Wulf. Tense, Tuck pulls a tinder box from his robes, strikes a flame."
116.,"EXT. CITY PARAPET - DAY John struggles over the battlement.   Collapses. FANNY 'Bout time, ya gurt lug. She wrenches the longbow from his back, fumbles for an arrow. FANNY We be too late."
117.,"CONTINUED: The burning fuse-cord reaches the barrel. Tuck hurls the smoking barrel thundering towards the Sheriff... Spotting it, Nottingham urges his horse over his own men in his effort to escape. The Chieftain smites at Robin... his blow is blocked... by the Celt with the boar's head. KAABOOM! The GUNPOWDER in the barrel EXPLODES. Spewing smoke and wood. SCREAMS of panic. Soldiers fly. Mass confusion. Amidst the smoke... Robin's sword slashes through Wulf's rope. He hauls him onto the platform."
from parapet,John and Fanny peer down as the smoke clears. They watch Wulf struggle to his feet. A Celt sneaks up behind him. LITTLE JOHN Fight fair... 
118.,CONTINUED: He aims.   Grits his teeth... picks off the Celt with a shaft. LITTLE JOHN ...Or don't fight at all.
on scene,"Robin leaps and swings from gallows to gallows, kicking out, slashing down. Sends two Celts hurtling down the trap hole. Will battles the Sheriff. A reprise of his own fight with Robin, the roles reversed. The Sheriff, armed and mounted, flails at Will, who, unarmed, dodges in and around the horse's legs. Aslan and the Chieftain are locked in mortal combat. Aslan stumbles back and falls. The Chieftain swipes at his head. Aslan rolls aside. The sword smashes wood. Tuck surrounded, rolls another smoking BARREL... It EXPLODES. The Greybeard Baron spots Little John and Fanny on the parapet. GREYBEARD BARON Up there!   No mercy, shoot them! Crossbowmen on the opposite parapet fire.      Bolts ricochet all around Little John and Fanny."
on scene,"Aslan evades the charging Chieftain. Drop-kicks a soldier, takes his sword, and whirls back at the Chieftain. His blows have no effect on the Scot's black armor. The Sheriff rears his horse... hooves flail.. knocking Will to his knees. The Sheriff lunges... Desperate, Will grasps the sword, ignoring the pain... a tug of war. Blood pours from Will's hands, where the blade cuts in. He suddenly lets go... Nottingham topples from his horse. Will leaps on him. "
119.,"CONTINUED: WILL SCARLET Pain or death, you butcher? The Sheriff's men drag Will off before he can choke him. Raging, Nottingham climbs to his feet. Will is held by four men. NOTTINGHAM Here's another message to Robin Hood, written in your blood. He drives his sword repeatedly, insanely, into Will's belly. WILL SCARLET It's over, fool. You can kill my body, but you cannot kill our spirit. He finally drops... Nottingham heads for the castle. Robin attempts to follow. He swings from the noose, using the rope to vault over the surrounding soldiers. As he lands, he is waylaid by one of the barons and his men. REDHEAD BARON It's Hood!   Get him! The Chieftain knocks Aslan down.   Aslan loses his sword. CHIEFTAIN I am iron.   I am rock. I am your death. Aslan spots one of John's arrows protruding from a dead Celt's back. Scrambles over and tears it out. ASLAN You talk too much! He leaps... rams the arrow through the Chieftain's mouthpiece... out the back of his neck. The Chieftain grabs his helmet, trying to rip it off. He topples, his life's blood gushing from both sides of his neck. Aslan plants a foot on the slain warrior. ASLAN Englishmen! I am not one of you, yet I fight for you. Against a tyrant. Join me now. Join Robin Hood. The onlookers are inspired. Grabbing weapons from fallen soldiers, many join the fray. "
120.,"CONTINUED: Nottingham runs through the castle gate.   Angry peasants pursue. NOTTINGHAM Lower the portcullis! Now! A guard winds down the giant gate.   Nottingham hurls him aside. NOTTINGHAM Too slow, fool! He hacks at the ropes. The gate slices down like a guillotine, pinning soldiers and peasants alike."
121.,CONTINUED: NOTTINGHAM Seal the entrance. Guard it with your lives. ... Bring the bishop to my chapel.
122.,"CONTINUED: Robin snaps the reins, steering the rumbling cart across the yard. Bouncing in the back, Tuck lights barrels. FUSES smoke and CRACKLE. ROBIN Jump! Tuck jumps. Robin steers the wagon at the gate. At the last second, he slashes the reins and leaps onto the horse's back... The BARRELS EXPLODE! The portcullis is blown to kingdom come. Out of the smoke, Robin rides the old nag like a charger. Leads his cheering, ragged fighters through the open gate."
123.,"CONTINUED: The man refuses to speak. Robin looks up the corridor, sees six men guarding the private chapel's arched door- way. ROBIN Ah!   There is my answer. He hurls the man aside... The armed guards charge him."
124.,"CONTINUED: ROBIN I warned you, I would find you no matter what. NOTTINGHAM No companions? No army? You rush to your death for the sake of a woman. Lust has turned you into a fool... Recognize this, Locksley? He raises his sword to reveal its handle. A crucifix sculpted into the hilt... Robin's father's sword. NOTTINGHAM Appropriate I should use it to kill you with, don't you think? He lunges. A savage, accomplished swordsman, with fire in his eyes. Exhausted, Robin is driven back, parrying desperately."
friar,"Give my regards to the devil. The KEG ERUPTS, blowing the jailer through a wall."
125.,"CONTINUED: WULF Sorry, Father. Couldn't help myself. LITTLE JOHN Well, ya'll get a bloody good wallopin' if we get 'ome... For now, let's see how well I taught ya. Wulf sends an attacker plummeting off the parapet."
126.,CONTINUED: FANNY  Turn that on the Sheriff and his bullies. A deadly pause. A woman cook dumps the giant wedding cake right over the chef. Suddenly it's havoc. Flying food and cutlery.
aslan,Ali akbar! FRIAR Amen! MORTIANNA 
127.,"CONTINUED: The Bishop makes his escape.    Tuck blocks his path. FRIAR So! You sold your soul to the devil? BISHOP No, I swear it, in God's name. FRIAR Blasphemer! You accuse innocent men of Druid worship while you practice the black arts yourself. The Bishop surreptitiously draws a dagger from his robes."
bishop," I am sure you would not strike a man of the cloth. FRIAR Think again! Without an eyeblink's pause, Tuck punches the Bishop so hard, he flies back THROUGH a stained-glass WINDOW."
128.,"CONTINUED: ASLAN What you fear is not below. He charges at her with the bloody spear. She screams hideously as he thrusts it right through her chest. Her madness is superhuman. With strength beyond all reason, she crawls up the spear's shaft, forcing it further through her body in her effort to get at him. Clutching, screeching, hissing. Her talons groping at his face, Aslan strains to the last ounce of his will and heaves her over the battle- ments. With an ear-splitting shriek, she plummets to the ground."
