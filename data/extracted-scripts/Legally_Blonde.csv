Speaker,Dialogue
shooting draft,"July 31, 2000"
amy, I don't really -- know anyone.
elle,"  I'll meet you outside. As they go, Elle leads Amy over to a group of jovial Sigma Chi brothers."
elle, Too demure?
saleswoman,"  There ' s nothing I love more than a dumb blonde with daddy's plastic. She grabs a dress off the Clearance Sale rack, ripping off the ""HALF PRICE"" TAG."
margot, Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
elle," It's impossible to use a half-loop topstitch on low-viscosity rayon. It would snag the fabric. And you didn't just get this in, because I remember it from the June Vogue a year ago, so if you're trying to sell it to me at full price, you picked the wrong girl.  The saleswoman slinks off, embarrassed."
margot,"  Nice try...  Elle shakes her head and turns back to the girls as she slips on her Manolo Blahnik sandals, doing one last mirror check, smoothing down her golden mane."
elle,"  Girls, this is it. In a few hours, I'll be the future Mrs. Warner Huntington III."
amy,"  He's here!  Elle, standing nearby with Margot and Serena and several other DG's, smooths down her dress and takes a deep breath, o pening the door to find --  WARNER HUNTINGTON, III, 21, tall, chiseled and outrageously handsome. He takes her in, a smile spreading across his face."
warner, You're beautiful.
elle, So are you!
warner,  You ready?  Her face is awash with devotion.
elle, I am so ready.
.9., i  
margot," Why are you back so soon?  Serena sees Elle's bare hand.  SERENA                                   .  Did he forget the ring? Elle silently walks into her room.      Serena and Margot follow, worried.  11   INT. ELLE'S DELTA GAMMA ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                  11"
.., We're not engaged.     It's over!  SERENA AND MARGOT  What?!  ELLE
serena, What happened?  Elle starts to lose it again.  ;       ELLE  I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone mo r e --  Serious! .
serena, How could this happen?
elle, I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
serena," Are you sure?  Elle nods.    The girls rise, hugging her."
amy, Elle? ANOTHER SISTER passes.
old lady, No.
elle, It's Warner's older brother!
old lady," Who?  Elle continues, undaunted."
serena," What, like on va-kay?"
margot, Let's all go! Road trip!
margot, Why?!
margot,"  Yeah, luckily.  A MONTAGE OF THE NEXT 3 MONTHS BEGINS WITH..."
elle,"  My name is Elle Woods and for my admissions essay, I ' d like to tell all of you at Harvard why I ' m going to make an amazing lawyer."
elle,  And the laws and bi-laws of civil obedience are crucial to my life -- Serena skates by and fake-elbows Elle.
elle, One seventy-five...one seventy- five...  She opens it and stares at it for a long moment. Then turns it to the crowd and raises it above her head in triumph. The girls immediately begin jumping up and down as group joy ensues. Underdog yips with pride. The MONTAGE ENDS.  33   INT. HARVARD LAW ADMISSIONS OFFICE - DAY                       33
daniel,  Law school?  Sapphire puts a hand to her throat in distress.    Elle is confused.
elle, It's a perfectly respectable place...
daniel," Sweetheart, you don't need law school. Law school is for people who are boring and ugly and Serious. And you, button/ are none of those things.  Sapphire is in agreement."
sapphire, You were first runner-up in the Miss Hawaiian Tropic contest. Why throw all that away?
elle, Because this is what I want. I've worked hard for it. Don't you understand that this is important to me?
sapphire, Can't you just suck his wiener?
arrogant aaron, Whose knob did she honk to get in here?
elle,"  I guess it'll have t o . . . The Fuzzy Guy looks at the red-shirted BALD 2L next to him, as Elle walks off. ,"
dorky david," I have a Masters in Russian Literature, a Ph.D in Biochemistry, and for the last eighteen months, I've been de- worming orphans in Somalia."
enid," P h.D from Berkeley in Women's Studies-- emphasis in the History of Combat. And last year, I led the march for Lesbians Against Drunk Driving."
intense ivan," I've got an MBA from Wharton, worked on Wall Street for four years, mushed in three ididarods and I ' ve figured out how to crash the stock market in Sri Lanka if any of you want to get together later."
elle," I ' m a Gemini. I have a Bachelors degree from USC, where I was Sigma Chi Sweetheart and president of Delta Gamma, and last year ' -- I was Homecoming Queen .  She smiles, as the group leader nods, waiting."
elle," Wish me luck, Underdog. It's my first class as a serious law student.  She kisses him and looks down at her completely inappropriate skimpy Gucci outfit, which she accents by putting on trendy, wire-rimmed glasses."
arrogant aaron,"  H l o t e e. . . . . . . el hr.  Elle keeps going, not even noticing him. Eyes only for Warner. Arrogant Aaron stomps away, pissed at the perceived blow-off.  As Elle gets closer to Warner, she opts for wandering past him, seemingly oblivious to his presence."
warner,"  Elle?!  Elle turns, ultra-nonchalant."
elle," Warner?! Oh my God, I completely forgot you were going here!  He looks at her, confused.    People walk by, staring."
warner, What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
elle," No, silly.    I go here."
warner,  You go where?
elle, Harvard. Law school.
dorky david,  Aristotle.  Professor Stromwell approaches him the way Cruella de Ville approaches a puppy.
dorky david,  I don't know.
professor stromwell," Well, I recommend knowing before speaking.. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.  As she turns away --"
emmett, Good luck.
elle,"  Thanks again for your help!  Warner remains standing, still somewhat uncomfortable with her presence here."
warner, S o -- uh -- how was your first class?
elle, Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  
warner,  Good. Good.
elle," Do anything exciting? A female hand snakes around Warner's chest from behind. Warner turns and brings the owner of the hand around to his side, presenting her."
warner,"  Urn, hey, have you met Sarah?  Sarah, the horrible girl herself, holds out her hand to Elle, full of contempt."
sarah, Hi.     Sarah Knottingham.
elle,  You know her?
warner, She 's --  Sarah jumps in.
elle,"  I'm sorry, I just hallucinated."
warner, Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.  Elle looks stricken.     Sarah gives her a smug smile.
37., 42                                                               42
sarah," Warner told me all about you. You're famous at our Club. She says it in a way that is anything but flattering.   In fact, it's completely condescending.  SARAH  But he didn't tell me you'd be here."
warner, I didn't know --  Elle looks from Warner to Sarah.
paulette, Bad day?  Elle holds out her hands. Paulette dips them into a dish of soapy water.
elle, You can't even imagine.
paulette," .Spill.,  Elle lets it all out in a rush."
elle," I worked really hard to get into law school -- I blew off Spring Break and Greek Week to study for the LSATs, I completely neglected my Homecoming Queen duties, I hired a Coppola to direct my admissions video -- all so I could get my boyfriend Warner back and now he's engaged to this awful girl Sarah so it was all for nothing! I wish I ' d never even come to Harvard.  Paulette dries Elle's hands and begins filing."
paulette, After you went to all that trouble?
elle, Neither.
professor donovan, Why not?
elle," I'd rather have a client who's innocent.  Elle smiles, proud of her answer. The class snickers. Warner frowns."
professor donovan," .        Dare to dream, Ms. Woods. Ms. Knottingham? Which would you prefer?"
enid, Before you voted against me and called me a dyke behind my back?
elle," I don't use that word. Only mean people use that word. You must've heard it from Sarah.                     . She looks back at Warner's table and walks off. As she does., she's nearly mowed down by a gaggle of NERDS led by DORKY DAVID, who knock the muffins out of her hands. She stands there, even more depressed."
margot,  Guess what I ' m doing right this second?
elle, Power yoga?
elle,  Re a ll y -- Margot grabs the phone back.
enid," The English language is all about subliminal domination. Take the word ""semester"". It's a perfect example of this school's discriminatory preference of semen to ovaries. That's why I ' m petitioning to have next term be referred to as Winter Ovester.  The guy backs up in fright. As Elle passes, Enid looks over.  ENID  -- are those real?  Elle snorts."
elle," Enid, please -- silicone is so 90's."
elle, I am. Didn't you hear about the Playboy Bunny who slit her ex- boyfriend's new fiancee's throat with a broken wine glass? It was tragic.  She grabs a glass of wine and moves on.  58   EXT. OFF-CAMPUS HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT                         58
elle," Hey, O.J.  Warner turns. He looks around for Sarah.      Not seeing her, he smiles at Elle, admiring her costume."
warner, Wow.    You're a walking felony.
elle, Thank you.     Having fun?
warner,  Now I am.
one of them holds a salad,A group of tipsy ILs stand around. bowl filled with cash.
sarah," If she spreads her legs, maybe --"
arrogant aaron,  Only if I ' m feeling generous.
sarah," Look around, Elle.      Do you actually think you belong here?  They all stare at her."
elle,  Why wouldn't I?
enid, Because the rest of us provide some worthwhile value to society?
arrogant aaron," Hold on, now -- every society needs a bimbo. Who are we supposed to sleep with after we get rich?"
elle, You know what? All of you can just kiss my ass. She yanks off her Bunny tail and throws it at them. Hurt and anger in her eyes. Then walks out of the room.
professor stromwell, Meaning? Everyone now stares at Elle.
professor stromwell," And what kind of evidentiary support does this case require? Let's ask Mr. Harriman, who clearly believes that I might be hungry. She looks up at Arrogant Aaron in the back row. Who unknowingly has ""Eat Me"" written on his forehead. He looks back at her, confused, as the students around him snicker."
warner," . According to Swinney v. Neubert, Swinney, who was also a private sperm donor, was allowed visitation rights as long as he came to terms with the hours set forth by the parents. So, if we're sticking to past precedent, Mr. Latimer wasn't st al ki ng -- he was clearly within his rights to ask for visitation."
professor donqvan," But Swinney was a one-time sperm donor, and in our case, the defendant was a habitual sperm donor, who also happens to be harassing the parents in his quest for visitation."
sarah,  The idiot speaks.
elle," Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?  The class titters.    Elle grows annoyed."
professor donovan, You did well today.  She stops.
elle, I did?
professor donovan," You're applying for my internship, aren't you?"
elle, I don ' t know --
professor donovan, You should. Do you have a resume?
elle," And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it? .  See you tomorrow!"
., No.                                                          '
;," What the hell happened to you? You get a job at a donut shop?  PAULETTE  That's not what --  DEWEY  How many times you gonna show up here, beggin1 me to take you back?        '  Paulette reddens -- flustered and humiliated.    Elle appears next to her.  ELLE  Dewey Newcomb?  DEWEY  Who's askin'  ELLE  . I ' m Elle Woods. Ms. Bonaf ante's                          . attorney.  Paulette looks at Elle in surprise, Elle keeps going."
dewey,"  Come again?  ELLE  Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.  DEWEY                       :  Huh?  ELLE"
intense ivan, Judge Sandra Day 0'Connor?
elle, What's going on?
dorky david, Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
elle," He chose them already?  Sarah, at the front of the throng, gasps, then turns to Warner."
sarah," We got it!  He grins and she kisses him on the cheek. Elle, shoved to the back, tries to get closer, when she hears --"
enid, The competition must not have been that '       stiff.  Arrogant Aaron pushes his way to the board.                         .
arrogant aaron, Why? ion .got a spot?
elle,  Remember the time after Winter Formal? When we spent four incredible hours In the hot tub...?
donovan," There's your office, there's the bathroom, there's the coffee machine. There's Gerard, Dick and1Bobby.  GERARD, smarmy and trim, DICK, short and bald, and BOBBY, black and bespectacled, wave as the interns pass by."
warner,  What about the murder weapon?
elle," There's no    way Brooke could've done this - - exercise    gives you endorphins, endorphins    make you happy -- happy people don't kill    their husbands! Sarah and Enid snort."
professor donovan, You don't really believe she's innocent?
elle," Of course, I do!  Emmett looks at her."
emmett," Then we may actually have a case.  He looks over at Donovan, who's not so sure."
donovan, What alibi?  '       .       .'
brooke, I can't tell you.  '        DONOVAN  You understand you're on trial for murder ?
brooke," I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside."
brooke," I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.  Donovan takes a moment to look at her like she's an idiot."
donovan, Were you with another man?
brooke, Go to hell.
donovan, I'll take that as a no.
brooke, Are we done for today?
donovan," I believe we are. He stands.    As do his minions.      As they file out, Brooke sees Elle."
brooke, Hey -- I know you.  Elle perks up.
elle, I ' m a Delta Gamma and I ' m a huge fan of yours!
brooke," Well, thank God one of you has a brain."
elle," I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I ' m the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty."
elle," So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?"
paulette," No. Sometimes I say ""Okay"" instead of ""Fine""."
elle, Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?  '.    '                                           .''
paulette, What's the point?  Look at me.
elle," I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman."
everyone," Bend -- And snapping back up -- on ""House"" ."
chutney," I got out of the shower,"" walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police."
donovan, Did she have a weapon in her hand?
chutney, No.
donovan, Was there any evidence that Mrs . Windham shot him?
chutney,  His dead body with a bullet in it.            .
72., 91   aONTINUED:                                                      91
enrique," Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.  The others shift uncomfortably, then look at each other. Then., back at Enrique and his shiny, unbuttoned-to-show-his-pecs shirt. The DA smiles."
gerard, She's screwing the pool boy.  Elle gasps and makes a face.
elle," There is no way a Delta Gamma would sleep with a man in a shiny shirt. Warner, back me up here.  Warner shrugs, embarrassed.    Sarah looks at Donovan."
sarah, I hate to agree ~ but I don't see the two of them actually --  -- doing it.
guard, Relation?
elle, I ' m her sister.
guard, Name?
elle, Delta.   Gamma.  He makes a note and buzzes her in.       '
elle," But I have to tell you the real reason I ' m here. Professor Donovan says we really, really need your alibi.  Brooke tears up."
brooke," Elle, I can't. You don't understand."
elle, Who could better understand than me?  Brooke dabs her eyes with a corner of the pink Ralph Lauren sheets.
brooke, It's so shameful...
elle, No!
brooke,"  I ' m a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I ' d lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!  Elle hugs her to her chest, consoling her."
elle," Your secret is safe with me.  95   INT. AUSTEN, PLATT, JARET & DONOVAN - LIBRARY - DAY            95"
donovan," ..              We've got two interviews tomorrow that Dick and Bobby are gonna handle, and the ex-wife in an hour. He looks up."
elle," I went to get her alibi.  Emmett looks over, surprised."
donovan, Did you get it?
elle, I can't give it to you. All I can tell you is that she's innocent.  An ASSISTANT pokes her head in the room.
assistant," Mr. Donovan? Mrs. Windham Vandermark is on line two.  Donovan rises, still annoyed."
donovan, Someone reason with her while I take this.  He walks out.     The others look at Elle.
bobby, Are you crazy? Tell him the alibi.
elle," , No!"
dick, We're gonna lose the case if you don't.
elle," I gave her my word, Warner.  Sarah watches -- seeing both Warner and Elle in a different light.  Donovan storms back in."
donovan, The ex-wife seems to be unconcerned with the fact that her interview is today. She's at a spa in the Berkshires.
gerard," A spa?  Isn't that like, your Mother-Ship? Elle shrugs and looks at Donovan."
gerard,  Have you ever been to a spa?
enid," And subscribe to the doctrine of self- hatred imposed upon my gender by male delusions of the way women are supposed to look?                                                    . Twice.  Donovan motions toward Elle. Then looks at Emmett with a pointed ""Get the alibi"" look."
donovan, Go with her.
emmett, She's completely untrustworthy.
elle, Why?
elle, You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
emmett,  How do you figure?
elle," Maybe not to your face...  She gives him a teasing smile.        He smiles back at her, shaking his head."
elle," Oh, and my friend Katherine Windham Vandermark is here somewhere and I ' m supposed to meet her. for a Pilates class. Do you have her schedule?"
desk clerk,  She's in the mud room until four.  Elle smiles her thanks and walks off with Emmett.
emmett, Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
elle," No, she can't move for an hour. She grabs his arm and pulls him down the hall."
emmett, Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?  MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK  Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas . Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
elle,  Ys. . . . e
emmett, Hovering?
emmett, How can you still believe she's innocent?
elle, For a butt-head? Yes.  She smiles at him.                             .
freshman girl," Look -- I ' m not going out with you. I can't believe you'd even ask. Girls like me don't go out with losers like you.  Her friends snicker. Elle stops at this and sighs, acknowledging to herself that she has to help this guy.   She turns and marches back, SLAPPING Dorky David across the   face. Dorky David is stunned, as is the Freshman Girl."
dorky david, What?
elle, We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
dorky david, I -- uh --  Elle signals with her eyes for him to go along with it.
elle, F or what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
dorky david, U h -- both?
elle, Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
elle, I believe you! Don't worry.  Brooke is taken away.
sarah, Save it.  She smiles at Elle.  SARAH  We'll drink it after we win.  Elle smiles .
paulette, Oh my God!  CUT TO:
ups guy, I 'm okay --
paulette," I think he noticed me, Elle --  But only because I maimed him!"
elle,"  I'll be over right after the trial, okay? We're about to cross- examine Enrique. And don't worry! My friend Serena barfed on a guy during ""The Blair Witch Project"" and end up dating him for three months. She hangs up. Enrique cuts in front of her in line for the water fountain. She glares at him, tapping her foot. He finishes getting his drink and turns, looking at her."
enrique," Don't stomp your little Prada sandals at me, Miss Thing. He walks past, as.Elle gapes at him.     Realizing.  109   INT. COURTROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER                           109  Elle grabs Emmett's arm as he whispers with Donovan."
elle, He's gay!    Enrique is gay!
emmett, What?! She grabs Warner as he's passing.
elle," Warner, what kind of shoes do I have on?  He looks down at her Prada sandals."
warner, Pink ones.
enrique, Yes.
emmett, Where?
enrique, A restaurant in Oakland.      Where no one would recognize us.
emmett, And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
enrique," Chuck. The audience lets out a gasp.      Elle looks up, shocked, then delighted.  Enrique begins to sweat."
chuck," If I ' m just your friend, why have we been doing the slippy-slap every night for the past six months?"
donovan," Good work today, Ms. Woods."
elle," Thank you!  He walks on.   She looks at Emmett, excited.   He high-fives her.  112   INT. BEAUTY OASIS - NIGHT                                       112"
paulette,"  And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!"
elle," Great. Donovan actually said the words ""Good work, Ms. Woods"". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?"
paulette, Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer.  Paulette looks at Elle. Emotional.
donovan,  Too bad. I thought you were a law student who wanted to be a lawyer.  Elle keeps walking.
emmett,  So now you're --?
paulette,  You can't go home!
elle," What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law s chool don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding mys elf -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass.  "
donovan, I do.   I'm not allowing it.
elle,"  But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my ""career""?  The implication lingers in the air, as Donovan glares at her."
judge,  The ruling also states that you need a licensed attorney to supervise you. Mr. Donovan?
donovan," That, I won't agree to.  Emmett steps forward."
emmett," I ' m supervising, Your Honor.  Elle smiles at him. Donovan looks from Emmett to Elle, completely derailed."
judge," Well, then, Ms. Woods.    Proceed.  Elle walks back to the table with a grin.       Warner looks shocked."
serena," Go, Elle! Donovan takes a seat in the audience.    As he passes by Brooke:"
donovan, Enjoy prison.  The judge looks at Brooke.
judge," Mrs. Windham, you do realize what you're doing?"
brooke," Absolutely. As Donovan sits, Margot leans over."
margot, Don't fuck with a Delta Gamma.
sarah," Kick some butt.  Elle looks at her, surprised."
judge," Ms. Woods, call your first witness."
elle, I'd like to recall Chutney Windham as a defense witness. The crowd murmurs.     Donovan rolls his eyes.
judge," Ms. Woods, begin your questioning.  ."
elle, Did you hear a shot fired?
emmett, Have a little faith.
elle," Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?"
chutney," I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home."
elle, Where you got in the shower.
chutney,  Yes.
chutney,  Yes.  The beginnings of a smile start to spread across Elle's face.
elle," You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to ~ curls really weren't the right look for her --  But, thankfully, that same day, she entered the Pi Kap wet t-shirt contest where she was completely hosed down from head to toe.  Donovan shakes his head at her incompetence.  DA JOYCE RAFFERTY  Objection.    Why is this relevant? Emmett clears his throat, worried. Elle turns around, giving him a ""trust me"" look. Then turns back to the judge."
elle,  I have a point. I promise.
judge, Then make it.  Elle looks at Chutney.                                   ..
elle," Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?"
chutney, Because they got wet.
elle, That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?  Chutney pales.
chutney, Yes -- Elle continues.
elle," And wouldn't someone who's had -- thirty perms ? -- throughout her lifetime, be well aware of this rule?  Chutney doesn't answer.     She just glares at Brooke.  ELLE  And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?"
chutney, She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
elle," You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your father?  Brooke looks at Chutney in horror, realizing."
chutney, I didn't mean to shoot him --  I meant to shoot you!  Pandemonium erupts.     The gavel pounds.
margot," Hello!   You're like, a lawyer."
elle,  Not yet.  Enid walks up to the girls.
enid,  Although -- you're kinda hot. Call me.  She walks off.   Serena looks alarmed.
elle,  Don't worry. She's harmless. I'll see you guys soon! Thanks for coming! She air-kisses them as Margot leads a still shell-shocked Serena away as Emmett walks up to Elle.
elle," Only blonde at heart.  Right? Elle smiles and looks down at -- the NEWLY BLONDE SARAH. Sarah returns the smile as we PULL BACK to see a CROWD of first year girls gathered around Elle's table, rushing to sign up. Ready to be as blonde as they can be.  FADE OUT:"
