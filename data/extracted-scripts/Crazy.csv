Speaker,Dialogue
cal,"Well, I'm full. You were right, hon. I shouldn't have eaten all that bread.  Want to just share a dessert?"
cal,"You okay, babe? You seem out of it."
tracy,"Yeah, I'm just thinking about what I want."
cal,"Me too. Okay, let's say it at the same time. One. Two. Three... TRACY CAL I want a divorce. Creme Brulee."
jessica,"It's okay, my fault.  Alright, kiddo, it's getting late, let's get you to bed before your parents get home. Don't give me the puppy eyes, you little maniac. Go brush your teeth!"
liz,Seriously? Conan O'Brien? You'd do Conan O'Brien?
hannah,"I'm just saying, Richard's a lot of things: successful, smart..."
liz,"Boring, workaholic, sexually repressed..."
liz,"Yeah, well, you want funny, go watch `Cosby' reruns. You want a good lay, go get yourself some of... that."
hannah,What?
liz,The hot piece that's been checking you out for the last hour.
tracy,Aren't you going to say anything?
tracy,"Almost twenty-five years of marriage, you have nothing to say?"
robbie,Close the door!
jessica," I'm sorry, Robbie! I didn't see anything, I swear."
liz,"I don't know, Hannah. Your life"
hannah,My life is not PG-13!
liz,"It so is. You've never left LA. You pass the bar you're gonna be, what, a patent lawyer, probably married to that snooze-fest Richard. I just worry about you is all. Hell, you've resorted to fantasizing about Conan `Ginger- Dick' O'Brien."
liz,"He looks like a carrot, honey."
liz,Hi.
jacob,Hi. Who looks like a carrot?
liz,Conan O'Brien. My friend Hannah thinks he's sexy.
jacob,I think your friend Hannah is sexy.
hannah,You didn't really just say that.
jacob,Pretty sure I did.
hannah,How old are you?
jacob,Thirty-three next month.
hannah,Then you should know by now that cheesy pick-up lines don't work.
jacob,"I find you incredibly sexy. It's a fact, not a cheesy pick-up line. "
hannah,I don't.
jacob,Yes you do.
liz,"Yes, she does."
jacob,"I'm an accomplished lover. If you come home with me, I am confident you will leave satisfied. Multiple times."
hannah,You've got to be kiddi--
jacob,We'll make love and it will be amazing. You'll laugh afterwards and say `I never do this kind of thing.' Then you'll do it again.
hannah,Is that so?
jacob,"It is. So now I'm going to ask if I can buy you another drink. If you say yes, we'll have one more cocktail each -- just enough to start losing inhibitions, not enough to get sloppy, after all: I promised to satisfy you."
liz,Multiple times.
hannah,What do you expect me to say to that?
jacob,"Margarita, rocks, salt."
hannah,Wow.
hannah,"Okay, time to go."
liz,"I'll go home with you, you can call me Hannah, I don't give a CRAP --"
hannah,Liz!
liz," Another time, maybe."
tracy,"I'm unhappy, Cal. I've tried not to be. We've been married so long, somewhere we became... stagnant, you know?"
tracy,"We've been spending time together. Lunches, meetings, that kind of stuff..."
tracy,I slept with him. Kind of.
tracy,David Jacobowitz. From work. You met him at the Christmas party. You remember that party? They had the giant paper-mach wreath? I kept asking the decorator how he made it? You wore that sweater --
cal,Please stop.
tracy,"The last person in the world I'd ever want to hurt was you, Cal --"
cal,"If you keep talking, I'm going to get out of the car."
cal,Okay.
tracy,Are you out of your mind!?
cal,"I'll leave tonight, I'll sign whatever you want me to sign, if you'll just stop talking about it."
tracy,Okay.
cal,Okay.
robbie,I'm sorry that you had to see that.
jessica,I should have knocked.  10. 9 CONTINUED: 9 Silence. After a long beat.
robbie,For the record: I think about you while I do it --
jessica,Robbie!
robbie,I have a picture of you and I look at it the whole time --
jessica,Stop it!
robbie,"I love you, Jessica. And I know you're seventeen, and I know I just turned thirteen, which is the same age as your little brother, and you're technically my baby- sitter, but someday soon our age difference will be inconsequential which is good because..."
jessica,ROBBIE --
robbie,I'm pretty sure you're my soulmate.
jessica,"Listen, Robbie --"
robbie,Shit.
jessica,"Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Weaver. How was dinner...  Oh my God, Mr. Weaver, you're bleeding. Why are you bleeding?"
robbie,Dad?
cal,Oh. I didn't know you were here.
robbie,You're getting divorced?
cal,Yes.
tracy,Cal!
robbie,And you jumped out of a car?
cal,"A moving car, yes."
tracy,Cal!
cal, I'm sorry you found out this way.
robbie,I'm sorry you jumped out of a car.
cal,"Thanks.  Jessica, you got your coat?"
jessica,Uh-huh.
cal,"I'll have to tell Nanna. Uch, she's gonna be crushed. But not right now. She's got enough to worry about..."
cal," So, I hear Stanford early admission, huh. I know your dad is so proud."
jessica,"Yeah.  You're bleeding real bad, Mr. Weaver."
cal,David Jacobowitz! Are you kidding me!? DAVID FUCKING JACOBOWITZ! GOD DAMN HER!
cal,Sorry about that.
jessica,It's okay.
jessica,"Mr. Weaver, I know you don't know me very well, but I've been baby- sitting for your family for three years. You're the nicest dad of any of the families I baby-sit for, by a country mile.  You're funny, and you're always really generous, and you're the only dad who's excited -- genuinely excited -- to check on his kids when he gets home from dinner. Now I like Mrs. Weaver, I like her a lot, but if she wants to divorce you, well... then I think she's batshit crazy."
jessica,"In fact -- and, I hope this doesn't make you uncomfortable -- I think I've even developed a LITTLE CRUS--"
cal, Hey: do me a favor -- can you not mention what's going on between Mrs. Weaver and I to your parents? It's probably better they hear it from us. Okay?
jessica,Uh-huh.
cal,That's my girl.
cal,"Hey, Jessica? Thanks for listening."
cal,You put this to that fake ID you'll need up at Stanford.
cal,Yes. Just... yes.
cal,Guess what?
girl,What?
cal,My wife is having intercourse with someone who isn't me.
girl,I'm sorry to hear that.
cal,"That's very nice of you to say. She just told me tonight, obviously it came as a bit of a shock and you're not listening anymore."
cal,I bet you wouldn't ignore me if I were David Jacobowitz. My wife doesn't ignore David Jacobowitz.  She screws him.
cal,"This is my youngest, Molly. Her two favorite things are High School Musical and her mother. I hate both of her two favorite things."
jacob,Jacob Palmer.
cal,CAL WEA--
jacob,"I'd like to buy you a drink, Cal."
cal,I already have a drink.
jacob,"Let me buy you a drink, Cal."
cal,Okay.
cal,My wife is cheating on me with --
jacob,"David Jacobowitz, yes, Cal, I've heard. We've all heard. For the last two nights, I've watched you batter every poor soul in this bar with your sad-sack loser sob story."
cal,"You know what, I don't need this CRAP --"
jacob,"Sit down, Cal."
cal,Okay.
jacob,"As I said, I've been watching you for two days now and I can say, without hesitation, that you are the sorriest man I've ever seen in my life -- don't interrupt, Cal, it's the truth, and you need to hear it. You're sitting there with your Supercut haircut, getting drunk on watered down vodka-cranberries like a fourteen- year-old girl, wearing a 41R jacket when you should be wearing a 40L -- I don't know if I want to help you or euthanize you -- stop drinking out of the goddamn straw, Cal."
jacob,"You asked me for advice before, Cal, so I'm going to help you. I don't know why. Maybe I'm just bored. Maybe all my friends have abandoned me for wives and children and labradoodle puppies, who cares why? Why doesn't matter. The point is, you've got a good face, and a good head of hair, and I'm bored as hell and need a project. So if you want, I'm going to help you rediscover your manhood. Do you remember when it was that you lost it?"
cal,"Yeah, okay."
jacob,"Mall food court, Thursday, six o'clock."
cal,"I'm sorry, what?"
jacob,You ready to go?
cal,"Okay, well, this is it. What do you think? Didn't have a lot of time to house-hunt, but..."
cal,There's a second bedroom with twin beds so you two can stay over whenever you want! Anytime!
robbie,"So... you're like, actually going to live here?"
cal,"Hey, hey. Come on now, you'll visit all the time. Every weekend. It won't be that bad."
molly,Don't you love us anymore?
cal,"Listen, baby. What's happening with your mommy and I... it's not what either of us wanted, not what either of us planned.  But you need to understand that you kids have done nothing wron--"
molly,TROY!
robbie,Don't take it personally. That show's like crack to her.
robbie,You okay?
cal,You?
robbie,Can I say something with a curse? One time?
cal,Yeah. Why not?
robbie,Love is fucked.
cal,"Is that so? You in love, buddy?"
robbie,"Well, if you must know --"
robbie,What is she doing here?
cal,"Oh, right, hey, Jess, thanks for COMING --  I have to run out really quickly, just for a few hours, and your mother wants you to stay here while she's out hooking --"
robbie,What?
cal,Huh?
jessica," The place is... nice, Mr. Weaver."
cal,"Yes, well, that's a generous adjective, thank you.  Anyhow, Jess is gonna keep an eye on you guys for a few."
robbie,But I don't need a babysitter! She's only four years older than me! You need to know that! She needs to know that!
cal,"I know, buddy."
cal,"My little boy's growing up, Jess. He's in love already, can you believe it?"
cal,"Molly, say bye-bye to Daddy?"
robbie,"Wait, where are you going?"
cal,"I'm, uh... I decided to take a class."
cal,"Okay, well... Molly, last chance!?"
cal,That's my angel. Back in a few.
robbie,"But, Dad --"
cal,Nope.
robbie,I don't need a baby-sitter.
jessica,"I know, Robbie."
robbie,I love you so much --
jessica,Jesus Christ.
cal,What am I doing?
richard,I think you're wrong. I think that's Tucker.
white man,"No, no, no. Chris Rock is the stand-up comedian. Chris Tucker is the actor."
white woman,Is it racist that I can't tell them apart?
liz,"Well, Richard: thank you for inviting me to Hannah's `goodbye' party. The conversation has been riveting, like stepping back in time. Before I go, a toast."
liz,Sweetie: go into your hole and study your cute little ass off for that bar exam. We'll see you when you emerge.
richard,She's gonna kick that bar's butt!
liz,"Yeah, okay.  30. 23 CONTINUED: 23 Liz CHUGS her drink, turns to Hannah."
hannah, I'll walk you out.
richard,"Hey, Liz? When my girl passes, we're gonna have another little celebration, right here. Hope you can make it. It's going to be a special night."
liz,"Richard, you just give me a heads- up so I can get really drunk before-hand, okay?"
richard,You know it!
hannah,Did you hear that? `It's going to be a special night.' You think he's going to propose?
liz,"At the Cheesecake Factory? Oh God, I hope not.  Why? Do you really want him to?"
hannah,He's nice.
liz,"Yeah, well... Jesus. Really?  Okay. Not my life, I love you, call me if you need anything."
jacob,You're late.  Sbarro's?
cal,No thanks. So what exactly are WE --
jacob,How much money can you afford to spend on clothes today?
cal,I dunno. Five hundred?
jacob,Three thousand.
cal,Okay.
jacob,We'll start with shoes. Let me see those sneakers you're wearing.
jacob,Take them off.
jacob," Other one too, please?"
cal,What the hell!?
jacob,"Are you in a fraternity, Cal?"
cal,"Those were my favorite shoes.  32. 24 CONTINUED: 24 JACOB ARE YOU IN A FRATERNITY, CAL!?"
cal,No.
jacob,Are you Steve Jobs?
cal,What?
jacob,ARE YOU THE BILLIONAIRE OWNER OF APPLE COMPUTERS?
cal,No. I'm not Steve Jobs.
jacob,"Then you don't need to walk around in New Balance Sneaker, ever. Let's go."
cal,I think this whole thing might have been a bad idea.
jacob,Any man can rebuild his entire wardrobe with sixteen simple items.
cal,Ha! I think I read that in GQ.
jacob,You did. I wrote it.
cal,Really?
jacob,"Numbers one and two: pair of dress shoes, pair of loafers.  33. 25 CONTINUED: 25 Cal is looking at a pair of ARGYLE SOCKS."
cal,"I'm sorry, I'm lost: do you really write for GQ?"
jacob,Your credit card please?
jacob,Take it in there... and there.
cal,These are two hundred and thirty dollars. Can't we just go to the Gap?
jacob,"No, Cal. We can't just go to the Gap."
cal,What's wrong with the Gap?
jacob,"In Hell, every store is the Gap, that's what's wrong with the Gap, Cal. It's lowest common denominator. Be better than the fucking Gap, Cal."
cal,I'm very warm.
cal,What does it do?
jacob, It tightens things up. The skin around your eyes looks like Milton Berle's ballsack.
cal,"Oh my God, it does."
cal,"I like to use a number four on the sides and the back, go longer on the top."
jacob,"Oh, okay. Thanks for that, Vidal Sassoon. Tiffany, hon? Scissor cut, tight on sides, get him some texture up top, take off about... He touches Cal's hair, measures it between his fingers."
cal,Eww.
jacob,... inch off the top.
tiffany,"Yes, sir."
cal,BUT --
jacob,What are you putting on?
jacob,Perfect.  You smell great by the way.
tiffany, Thanks.
jacob,What are you doing tonight?
tiffany,I don't know.
jacob,"That's okay, I do."
jacob,"Yes, Cal, just like that."
jacob,Yep.
cal,Can I blouse out the shirt a little? I like to blouse out my shirts a little.
jacob,"Shut up, Cal.  You'd fuck him, right?"
cal, Jesus!
tiffany,"Yeah, probably."
cal,Tiffany!  You would!?
jacob,"You see that, Cal? The simple act of opening your mouth instantly causes Tiffany to lose interest in sleeping with you. Your personality is actually your weakest link."
cal,"Well, that's the meanest thing anyone's ever said to me."
jacob,"No, Cal. The meanest thing anyone's ever said to you is this: your wife cheated on you because you lost sight of what it took to keep her content at home -- as a man, as a husband, and probably as a lover."
cal,"I notice you only button your shirts up, like, halfway. I can't pull that off, right?"
jacob,"No. Listen, Cal, I'm going to be calling women over to our table shortly."
cal,"We should have some background on each other, no? I'm in insurance, more on the corporate side. My kids are --"
jacob,"Cal, the only thing I care less about than corporate insurance are your kids. Here's the only thing I need to know: how many women have you been with?"
cal,Sexually?
jacob,Yes.
cal,In my entire life?
jacob,"No, synchronized swimming. Yes, Cal. Sexually."
cal,One.
jacob,"Wow, okay... wow.  Not at a time? Total?"
cal,What? I married young. We met in high school.
cal,"Tracy was so damn beautiful. You know those women, the ones who can be wildly sexy and unbelievably cute all at once? I never knew how she did that. I still don't know how she does it.  Anyway, we had a bit of a hiccup our senior year but we made it --"
jacob,"Cal, I literally stopped listening at `Tracy.' Okay, here we go."
cal, I miss my wife.
jacob,"Shut up, Cal."
young woman,Hi.
jacob,Hi. Jacob Palmer.
young woman,Amy Johnson.
jacob, Don't.
cal, -- Weaver.
jacob,"Can I get you a drink, Amy?"
jacob,Tell me about yourself. What do you do?
new girl,Does it really matter?
jacob,It does to me.
jacob,It does to me.
newer girl,"And that's when I started writing the column for LA Weekly. God, how long have I been talking?"
jacob,Let's get out of here. I know it's forward of me but just... I think we should get out of here.
newer girl,Okay.
jacob,I think we should get out of here.
new girl,Okay. FLASH CUT TO:
jacob,I think we should get out of here.
first girl,Okay.
robbie,"You want to talk about The Scarlet Letter, Mrs. Thompson? Here you go: the `A' they're both wearing -- I think it stands for ASSHOLE. Wanna know why? Because they're in love, and love is for stupid ASSHOLES. So thanks for choosing this book, Mrs. Thompson, because this is what I need right now: to read a boring, confusing book about a bunch of stupid assholes who fell in love, like assholes, and then had to die, like assholes. I'm sorry for cursing. CUT TO:"
tracy," Yes, of course. Absolutely, Principal Sapienza, it won't happen again."
tracy,Seriously?
robbie,Sorry.
tracy,"It's been a rough couple of weeks, you deserve a freebie. C'mon, I have to get back to work."
tracy,"They still make kids read The Scarlet Letter, huh?"
tracy,You'd really think someone would have written something better by now.
tracy,"Guess I should take it down, huh?"
robbie,I guess.
tracy,"How is he? I've spoken to him but only about bills, or you kids, but... how is he, really?"
tracy,"Sorry, that's unfair. Ignore me, I'm almost done here."
robbie,He's dressing a lot better. Going out a lot.
tracy,"Oh. Well, good. That's... really good.  We'll get take-out for dinner tonight, okay? Think about what you're in the mood for."
robbie,"He's sad. He looks better, but... sadder, too, I think. You know?"
tracy,"Yeah. I guess I'm pretty sad, too."
robbie,I know.
tracy,"It's my fault, what happened with your father. It's grown-up stuff that I can't talk about but... it's my fault. Not his. So just... be good to him, okay?"
robbie,"It'll be okay, Mom."
tracy, You promise?
tracy,"David, this is my son, Robbie. Robbie, this is David.  We work together."
tracy,"I'll be right back, okay, honey? ROBBIE DAVID Okay. Okay."
robbie,"So, David... I hear you broke up my parents' marriage."
robbie,"You are David Jacobowitz, right? From accounting?"
david jacobowitz,"Um, yes I am --"
robbie,"Here's the thing, David: in the end, she winds up back with my dad. He's better than you, in every category except probably math. And she still loves him."
david jacobowitz,"Listen, Robbie --"
robbie,"Now I know what you're thinking: `he's just in 8th grade, what does he know about love?' I know a lot more than you think, David. Just today, I had a meltdown, almost gave up on the love of my life. My dad's having his meltdown now, but long-term? He won't stop fighting for my mom any more than I won't stop sending Jessica texts that make her uncomfortable. And you need to know that."
tracy,You ready to go?
robbie," Mommy, can we do Chinese for dinner tonight?"
jacob,"I think you're ready, Cal."
cal,"For what?  51. 46 CONTINUED: 46 JACOB To talk to a woman, take a woman home."
cal,"Oh, no. No, I'm not."
jacob,You've been watching me do it for two weeks.
cal,"Yeah, well, I've been watching LeBron James for years, doesn't mean I can suddenly dunk a basketball."
jacob,"Cal, do you remember the part in Karate Kid, where Mr. Miagi keeps having the kid wax the car and the kid gets all bent out of shape because he doesn't see the point, but the movements were actually building blocks for throwing and blocking punches?"
cal,Oh God. Are you going to make me fight someone?
jacob,"Cal, what's the first thing I do when a woman sits down?"
cal,You ask if you can buy her a drink.
jacob,And what if she says no?
cal,"You order her a drink anyway, let it sit there."
jacob,When she asks me a question about myself?
jacob,And what happens?
cal,They talk about themselves. A lot.
jacob,And what do I do?
cal,You act really interested. You nod a lot.
jacob,And at the end of the night?
cal,"You compliment them, then you ask if they'd like to come back to your place."
jacob,Do I ask?
cal,No. You confidently tell them you'd like them to come back to your place.  Holy shit! You Mr. Miagi'd me!
jacob,"Oh, and no talking about your job, your children, your pathetic sexual history, or David Jacobowitz. Okay, here we go..."
cal,"What, no, I'm not ready for --  Hi!"
cal,"Can I buy you a drink, Kate?"
cal,"I'm buying you a drink anyway, Kate, so you might as well tell me what you want."
kate,"Really, thank you but it's okay."
cal,"I'm guessing you're a vodka girl, am I right? Yeah? A nice dirty martini? No, no, no: a Grey Goose, rocks, extra lime? C'mon, one drink! Picture those ice cubes clinking together. Mmmm. Can't you taste it?"
kate,"Yes, I can but... I'm, uh, five years sober so..."
waitress,What can I get --
cal,Nothing. We don't want anything. Don't come back here ever.
kate,"So... what do you do, Cal?"
cal,"What do you do, Kate?  46 KATE I asked you first."
cal,I asked you second.
kate,"Seriously, what do you do?"
cal,"Seriously, what do you do?"
kate,"I'm a teacher. Now, c'mon: what do you do?"
cal,Teacher. Interesting. I'm very interested in teaching.
kate,"I'm sorry, are you not going to tell me what you do?"
cal,"A teacher with an alcohol dependency no less, I bet that's actually more common than people realize..."
kate,I should get back to my friends --
cal,"I'm sorry! I'm supposed to deflect your questions... oh screw it: I'm in corporate insurance. And I have children. Plural. More than one. The only thing I have ONE of, is sexual partners, that would be the woman I recently separated from because she was cheating on me with David Jacobowitz who I wasn't supposed to tell you about either.  46 Kate turns back, curious."
kate,What were you supposed to tell me?
cal,"I don't know: that you're a perfect combination of sexy and cute -- it was something I said about my wife that's since been corrupted. But I'm tired, and I'm at least fifteen years older than you, and this sweater is called slim fitting but it's really just uncomfortable and itchy."
kate,You think I'm a perfect combination of sexy and cute?
cal,That's what you took away from that?
kate,"Wow, an actual honest man. I don't know what to do with that. It's kind of... rare around here.  It's nice, actually."
cal,It is?
kate,"You have no idea. I'm kind of a magnet for these jerk-offs. They charm me, and I fall for it, and at some point they just... never call me again."
cal," I don't understand. Look at you. Who wouldn't call you again? She looks up. It's not a line, it's a genuine compliment. She smiles warmly. Holy shit, Cal is in!"
cal,"Well, eventually I'm `supposed' to ask you if you want to get out of here. Actually no, I'm supposed to tell you, confidently, that you should come home with me."
kate,"Why don't you give it a shot, see what happens?"
cal,"You're very pretty, Kate. And I can't tell if you're being serious, but I think you should come home with me."
kate, Ask me again.
cal,"I'm not asking you, Kate. I'm telling you: you should come home with me."
cal, This is my dumpy apartment that I had to move into when I left my wife.
cal,I've never been with a woman besides my ex-wife.
kate,"More, tell me more."
cal,I'm worried you have AIDS.
cal,Only a little.
cal,Show you off to my wife to make her jealous.
claire,"Oh, I almost forgot -- heard some good gossip at the nail salon."
bernie,"For God's sake, Claire."
claire, It's about Cal.
bernie,"Leave the poor bastard alone, would you? I gave him the cologne like you told me to. We don't have to dance on his grave."
claire,"Apparently, Mr. Weaver has become quite a man-about-town if you get my drift."
jessica,What?
claire,Lots of young women coming in and out of his apartment lately.
bernie,"Claire, would you cut it out?"
claire,It's good for Jess to know. She still baby-sits for him after all.
claire,"Well, it's good gossip at the least. Ooh, guess what else I heard..."
jessica,"Madison! Madison, wait!"
jessica,"Hey, I had a question --"
madison,"Hey, Jessica, whassup?"
jessica,"I had a question for you, Madison. It's kind of on the personal side so..."
madison,My lips are...
madison, My lips are seals.
jessica,"Oh, okay. So, Madison, here's the thing... I don't mean to be blunt or insulting but, let's call it what it is: you're always sleeping with older guys, right?"
jessica,"Lots of college guys, I've heard."
madison,Lots of them.
jessica,Even rumors about a few teachers.
madison,Totally.
jessica,"So my question is: how do you do that? I mean, how do you get them not to see you as... well, a kid in high school?"
madison,"Oh, well first off, I have a huge rack."
jessica,"You do, yes."
madison,So that helps.
jessica,"Yes, I'm sure it does."
madison,You don't have a huge rack.
jessica,"No, I don't unfortunately."
madison,So that's not gonna work.
jessica,Nope.
madison,"Okay, here's what you do. Wait, how old is he?"
jessica,Old.  54 MADISON Like really old?
jessica,Like parent old.
madison,"Nasty. Rock on, Jessica."
jessica,"Thank you, Madison."
madison,"Alright, you have to hook him. Force his hand. Make him unable to stop himself from doing what he knows to be wrong."
jessica,How?
madison,Do what I do. Send him a postcard from downtown.
jessica,Huh?
madison,Go TMZ on his ass.
jessica,"I'm not following you, Madis--"
madison,"Don't send it to him as a jpeg, though. He'll put it up on his fantasy football web-site. And then your brother sees it, tells your mom, and suddenly you're not allowed to use Facebook for a month. Thanks, Kevin!"
robbie, There she is!
robbie,"I am not bewildered! Jessica Riley is my soulmate. She's the one! I know it to be true, and so now do the multitude.  No, multitude."
jessica,"Robbie, get down!"
robbie,"I have marked myself with this Scarlet J, Jessica! For you. Because your name starts with a J. It's just tape and construction paper but one day I will get a permanent tattoo when I'm old enough that my parents won't freak out on me."
jessica,Robbie Weaver! I am your baby- sitter and I'm telling you to GET YOUR ASS DOWN FROM THERE NOW!
jessica, What the hell are you thinking?
robbie,"You like the scaffold? It has wheels. Took four weeks to build it.  Oh, those are my friends, they helped me wheel it down. Wave hello."
jessica,"This has to stop, Robbie. Seriously."
robbie,You'll learn to love me. I promise.
jessica,I won't.
robbie,Just because I'm four years younger than you?
jessica,BECAUSE I LOVE SOMEONE ELSE!!!
jessica,I've been spending time with him for a while.
robbie,No. You can't. I've checked. No boyfriend since ninth grade. No date for Spring Formal last MONTH --
jessica,He's older. I don't want my parents to know.
robbie,Who is he?
jessica,It doesn't matter.
robbie,Do I know him? Is he from town?
jessica,"I don't know. Yes, kind of.  55 ROBBIE I'll kill him if he hurts you."
jessica,"I know. But this all has to stop now, Robbie. The speeches, the texts, all of it. It's very sweet, but it has to stop."
jessica,"I'll see you around, okay?"
robbie's friend,We should probably get the scaffold back on the road before dark.
robbie,Yeah.
cal," Kids, say hi to Nanna."
cal,"Oh, I've been keeping busy. Made a new buddy, I've been spending time with him. Yeah, I'm going to see her tomorrow night. Of course I miss her. You don't know how much I miss...  67. 56 CONTINUED: 56 His voice cracks. He turns, sees Robbie staring. He heads into the bathroom with the phone, closes the door."
robbie,"So you're seeing Mom tomorrow, huh? At my parent-teacher thing?"
cal,Yeah.
robbie,First time in a while.
cal,"Yeah, but no biggie."
cal,"Hey, what's with the moping?"
robbie,Nothing. It's just... there's this girl.
cal,Oh yeah? You like her?
robbie,"I like Pringles. This girl's my soulmate. I'm like crazy, stupid, in love with her. And she wants someone else."
cal,But she's your soulmate?
robbie,Yeah.
cal,Well you can't just give up.
cal,I didn't give up.
robbie,"Listen, Dad. I love you. I have your back, always. But let's be honest here: the woman told you she wanted a divorce and you jumped out of a car."
cal,It was slightly more complicated than that. And I'm a different guy now.
robbie,You're the same guy. You just have different clothes. Do you still love her?
cal,How old ARE you?
robbie, Do you still love Mom?
cal,Weren't we talking about you?
robbie,"We are. Your son is in desperate need of some romantic inspiration. So set an example for your boy. Don't give up. It's complicated? Uncomplicate it. She says no? Change her mind. Look at you, you're the man right now, Dad. Get her back.  Get back my mom."
tracy," You look great, Cal."
cal,"Oh, well turns out I've been buying the wrong size suit for twenty years so..."
tracy,Well you look great. Really.
cal,"Thank you.  You always look great, so..."
cal,I talked to Nanna yesterday.
tracy,"Me, too. She sound okay to you?"
cal,I feel like I'm about to get detention.
cal,Which teacher is this?
tracy,Mrs. Thompson. This is the one he pulled The Scarlet Letter Asshole routine on.
cal,"He's a really weird kid, isn't he?"
tracy,"Yeah.  I kind of like him, though."
cal,"I do, too. I'm so glad we switched the babies at the hospital."
tracy,"Me, too."
cal,"So, how are things with...  How's it going with David?"
tracy,"Oh... it's not.  It wasn't about him, if that means anything."
cal,"No, I know.  59 Cal looks at his watch, a nervous gesture."
tracy,You seeing anyone?
cal,"Who, me? No. You know me. No, not really."
tracy,"Oh. Because you hear things, you know."
cal,"Yeah, well..."
cal,"I miss you, T."
cal,"I got complacent, I think. You find your soulmate in high school... you've got the game sewed up in the first quarter, you know?"
cal,"I put in an effort when we were younger, didn't I? I'd do anything to make you happy: take you miniature golfing, dancing -- you were such a good dancer."
tracy,I had to be. You were such a good miniature golfer.
cal,"All I ever wanted to do was make you love me. And then you did, really early on. And we got married so young. And I guess... I got lazy. I got boring. And I'm furious at you for what you did. But I don't totally blame you, if that makes any sense?  I shouldn't have jumped out of the car. I should have fought for you. You fight for your soulmate. At least that's what our thirteen- year-old tells me."
tracy,"He's a very strange boy, isn't he?"
cal,I'll be honest: he scares the shit out of me.
tracy,"I missed you, too."
cal,Oh God.
kate,Cal? What are you doing here?
cal, Really?
tracy,You two know each other?
cal,"Um, yes... we've met before."
cal,Mrs. Thompson? This is my wife. Tracy.
kate,"Oh, so now she's your WIFE again? HOW CONVENIENT!"
cal,Why don't we head inside?
kate,"YES, WHY DON'T WE!?"
tracy,"I'm sorry, I'm playing catch-up: how do you two know each other?"
kate,Maybe your husband should tell you.
kate,Ha!
cal,"You know, maybe we should focus on Robbie?"
kate,"Yes, let's do that. Let's focus on Robbie."
kate,"Asshole. Are you familiar with this word, Mrs. Weaver?"
cal,"She's heard it, yes. So in terms of Robbie's progress --"
kate,"Asshole: as in, someone who tells a woman that he'll call, and never does."
cal,We were a little concerned about Robbie's grade on his oral book REPORT --
kate,"Asshole: as in, someone who uses `honesty' to get a woman into bed with him, but is actually full of shit like the rest of them."
cal,Because usually he's a very strong public speaker --
kate,"Asshole: as in, someone who allows a woman to go down on him for forty-five minutes because he's `nervous' --"
cal,OKAY! ENOUGH!!!
cal,I can explain.
cal,She's an alcoholic! You can't trust what she says!  60 KATE SCREAMS in horror. Cal races after Tracy. Kate races after Cal.
cal,"Tracy, wait!"
tracy,"Leave me alone, Cal!"
kate,"I'm sober for FIVE YEARS, you ASSHOLE!"
cal,"Tracy, c'mon! We were separated."
tracy," I know, and I cheated, so it doesn't make any sense for me to be mad at you."
cal,"Okay, so --"
tracy,"I can't do this now, Cal."
cal,"Tracy, I love you."
kate,"Tell her she's the perfect combination of sexy and cute, ASSHOLE!"
tracy,I'm going home.
cal,"Tracy, wait! Yes, I slept with her! I slept with our son's eighth grade teacher!"
cal,"But all it did was confirm what I already knew: THAT I LOVE, YOU! I LOVE YOU!!! Tracy hesitates. Cal seizes the moment."
cal,"Before, you were the only woman I'd ever been with or wanted to be with. And now, even after I've been with eleven women, you're STILL..."
cal, ... the only woman I want to be with. TRACY I don't even know who you are.
cal, I'm your soulmate.
cal,HE DESERVED AN `A' ON THAT BOOK REPORT AND YOU KNOW IT!
cal,REALLY!!!???
richard,"Excuse me, everyone. Everyone!?"
richard,"Now, if we could get our guest of honor over here... I forget what she looks like, anyone remember?"
richard,"I'm so proud of you, baby. I had my doubts, of course..."
richard,Now I did tell you that it'd be a special night when you passed the bar. And I'm a lawyer so you know I never lie...
richard,"So, Hannah, I'd like to formally ask you, in front of all our friends and colleagues...  78. 64 CONTINUED: 64 Hannah waits, frozen."
richard,"... if you'd like to become a permanent lawyer at the firm of Watkins, Goldberg, and Schmidt!?"
richard,"You don't have a better offer already, do you?"
hannah,"No, that's great. I just...  I'm sorry, I thought... I thought you were about to propose."
richard,What?
hannah,"No, I just... it's fine. I'm sorry, I just got thrown is all."
richard,"Honey, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize."
hannah,"No, no, don't be silly, it's fine."
richard,"It's definitely a possibility, down the road. I think I just need a little more time. I'm still figuring out how I feel about us, you know: long-term."
hannah,"No, I know...  Wait -- you're figuring out how you feel about us? She LAUGHS. Once. Then twice. Loudly. Everyone's now watching. Liz gets a good seat, excited."
hannah,"You know what the best part is: I would have said yes! To YOU! And I didn't even want you to propose! Just now, I swear to God: I was hoping you wouldn't propose. And I still would have said YES! That's how pathetic I am!"
hannah,"I will consider your job offer, thank you so much, Richard."
woman,And you know what she said?
hannah,Do you remember me?
jacob,Yes.
hannah,Do you still think I'm attractive?
jacob,Yes.
hannah,Do you still want to take me home?
jacob,Yes.
hannah,Let's go.
jacob,Is that a compliment?
hannah,I'm not sure.
hannah,I like this song.
jacob,I thought you would.  Drink?
hannah,"Yes, please."
jacob,Cheers.
hannah,Cheers.
hannah,So is this how it normally works?
jacob,What?
hannah,"How you woo a woman? You take them back to your granite- countered bachelor pad, put on the perfect song, and make them a drink?"
hannah,And then you sleep with them?
jacob,Yes.
hannah,So that's what happens next? We sleep together?
jacob,"At some point, yes, I was under the impression that was your plan."
hannah,I'm very nervous.
jacob,I'm getting that.
hannah,"I know at the bar I seemed confident, but I was more just soaking wet and cold and trying to be dramatic."
jacob,You're adorable.
hannah,"No! Not adorable! Sexy! R-rated sexy! Because I know what happens next in the PG-13 version of tonight: I get really drunk, and I pass out, and you cover me with a blanket, and kiss my forehead, and nothing happens... but that's not why I'm here!  I'm here to bang the hot guy from the bar who hit on me."
hannah,I do. We're going to bang. I'm finally going to do something exciting and dangerous and Liz can blow me!
hannah,"Okay, okay, this is happening.  Take off your shirt."
jacob,What?
hannah,I need to stop thinking. Take off your shirt.
hannah,Holy crap.
hannah,It's like you're photo-shopped.
jacob,Now take off yours.
hannah,No way! Not with all that happening...
hannah,So... do you prefer to do it here or in the bedroom?
jacob, In the bedroom is preferable.
hannah, This pillow is amazing. It forms perfectly to the shape of my head.
jacob,I'm glad you like it.
hannah,"Wait, are these those foam pillows from Brookstone?"
hannah,"They are, aren't they!? I always wondered who actually buys them! You do! The hot guy from the bar buys them! Of course!"
hannah,"Sorry, let's proceed."
hannah,"You don't have one of those ridiculous massage chairs, do you?"
hannah,Oh. My. God! You totally do!
jacob, I do.
hannah,How much did it cost?
jacob,Five thousand doll--
jacob,Do me a favor. Ask me a question about myself.
hannah,What? No! I don't want to know anything about you.
jacob,"C'mon, one question."
hannah,"Okay, fine, but then we bang."
jacob,"Absolutely. Now, come on, I'll answer anything. You can ask me about my job, or past GIRLFRIENDS --"
hannah,What's your mom like?
jacob,"Icy... I guess? Not cruel, but cold. Very cold."
hannah,And your father?
jacob,"He died, long time ago. Left us a lot of money, which is how I have..."
jacob,Stuff like this.
hannah,And time for stuff like that?
jacob,"My dad was the opposite of my mom, actually..."
cal,Nanna's coming over tonight. You guys haven't seen her in a while. Wanna stay for dinner?
robbie,Sure.
cal,"Your mom's working till five, we'll have to tell her.  What do you guys want to do today?"
molly, High School Musical.
cal,"Well, there's a shocker."
robbie,She still won't talk to you?  94. 80 CONTINUED: 80 CAL Not if that show's on.
robbie,"No, I mean, Mom."
cal,"Oh, no. Just hellos and goodbyes when we pass you guys off."
robbie,What happened?
cal,"Beyond your pay-grade, buddy."
cal,"I will say this though: I got close. We were laughing. Talking about old times, all the things we used to do..."
cal, Hey. Get your coat.
cal,Baby? I'm gonna have to turn off the show.
molly,No!
cal,I have to --
molly,NOOOO!
cal,I'm turning it off --
molly,NOOOOOOOOOOO!
cal,Oh. My. God. It's alive.
jacob,I'm sorry. I know I've been out of circulation.
cal,I bet you did.
jacob,"No, I mean, I've been spending a lot of time with her. This woman. One woman."
cal," Okay, whatever."
jacob,"Actually, tonight... I'm going to meet her mother."
cal," 97. 86A CONTINUED: 86A JACOB Yes, I realize that, asshole."
jacob,Gotta go. Grab a beer next week?
cal,"You've got my number.  Hey. Good for you, by the way."
jacob,Thanks.
jessica,No!!!!
jessica,Daddy?
tracy,Baby! What are you wearing!?
robbie,I have to blindfold you.
tracy, What is this? What is he doing?
robbie,"Okay, we're good, let's do this."
cal,"Hi, T."
tracy,"Can I take these off, please?"
cal,Almost. Kids?
cal,Nanna!
hannah,"Hi, Daddy."
jacob,Cal?
jacob,What the hell are you doing here?
hannah,"Wait, you two know each other?"
tracy," Hi, Nanna."
cal,"Wait, what's going on?"
robbie,"Hey, Nanna."
hannah,"Hey, Robbie."
molly,"Hey, Nanna."
hannah,"Hey, cutie."
jacob,WHAT THE HELL IS A NANNA!?
hannah,"It's me, I couldn't pronounce Hannah when I was little -- wait, so how do you know my dad?"
jacob," Oh, God."
cal, I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON HERE!
hannah,"Dad, this is my boyfriend, Jacob."
cal,No. No. No. No.
jacob,HOW THE HELL DO YOU HAVE A 24-YEAR- OLD DAUGHTER!?
cal,I WAS SEVENTEEN! SHE WAS OUR SENIOR YEAR HICCUP! IT'S WHY WE GOT MARRIED SO YOUNG!
jacob,WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME THAT?
cal,YOU NEVER LET ME TALK ABOUT MY CHILDREN!
hannah,"So you two, like, really know each other?"
cal,"No way -- you and her... no way. End it, now."
hannah,Daddy!!!
jacob,"Well, that's not going to happen. CAL Well, then I'm going to murder you."
hannah,DAD!
tracy, Will someone please take this goddamn thing off me!
cal,"Robbie, take the goddamn thing off your mother!  Bernie?"
robbie,Is that Jessica?
hannah,Daddy!
jessica,Daddy!
tracy, What's happening?
bernie,"I LET HER BABY-SIT FOR YOU, YOU SICK SON OF A BITCH! SHE'S SEVENTEEN!"
hannah,Jacob!
cal," Bernie, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!"
jessica,"Daddy, stop!"
jessica,He didn't do anything. He doesn't even know.
cal,Know what?
tracy," Robbie, please get this off me!"
robbie, I'm TRYING!
jessica,He doesn't even know that I'm in love with him!
robbie,With who?
jessica, With him.
cal,Are you pointing at me?
robbie,Are you pointing at him?
tracy,Who is she pointing at!?
robbie, Wait: my dad is the older guy you've been seeing?
bernie,I knew it.
jessica, He doesn't even know about the dirty pictures I made for him.
robbie,You made him dirty pictures? Oh God.
robbie, You stole my soulmate.
cal,Wait: Jessica is your soulmate?
hannah,Who are you?
jacob,David Jacobowitz!
hannah,Jacob!
jacob,You know how much misery you've put this poor bastard through!?
cal,Stay the hell away from my daughter.
tracy,"Thank you, Officer."
cal,I'll kill you.
bernie,Let's go. Now.
jessica,I'm so sorry --
bernie,NOW!
cal,Don't. JACOB CAL --
cal,This man is a lowlife and a WOMANIZER --
hannah,"Dad, c'mon, I'm not going to stop seeing him."
cal,Well then I don't have anything else to say to you.
hannah,DAD --
cal,GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE!
tracy,"Cal, stop being unreasona--"
cal,I said: GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE!
jacob," Cal, c'mon --"
molly," Goodbye, cutie."
tracy, Nice.
waitress,Can I get you another?
cal,What time is it?
cal,"2:30 would have been sufficient but I appreciate the judgment, Cocktail Waitress.  Yes, another drink would be grand."
cal,That was uncalled for. Sorry for being a dick.
jacob,"It's a nice sweatsuit, Cal."
cal,What do you want?
jacob,Can I sit?
cal,"I don't know, can you?"
cal, `Are we going to be mature or act like children?'
jacob,"Okay, so like children then. Move over."
jacob,I'd like to talk.
cal,You still seeing my daughter?
jacob,Yes.
cal,Then I have nothing to say to you.
jacob,"Cal.  Cal, look at me."
jacob,You been hanging out here a lot?
cal,Sometimes.
jacob,Must be missing a lot of work.
cal,I have a lot of vacation days.
jacob,Some vacation.
cal,I hate the beach... you've got a lot of nerve coming here --
cal,"No, she probably spit in it."
jacob,Your kids miss you.
cal,"You're hanging out with my kids, fantastic! You can teach Robbie how to objectify women, he'll love that."
jacob,"Well you haven't exactly been around for him, Cal."
cal,"Alright, man-whore, if your lecture on parental responsibility is almost done --"
jacob,"I love her, Cal."
cal,I know you. I know what you are. You are not good enough for my daughter. And you will never have my permission nor my approval.
jacob,I'll see you at graduation.
kate,"Our next speaker is not only the class salutatorian, but he's also one of the most...  Spirited... young men, I've ever had the pleasure of teaching. Ladies and gentlemen: Robbie Weaver."
robbie, I wasn't really sure what I wanted to talk about today. Mrs. Thompson said it might be good to talk about growing up and getting older and stuff. So I guess I'll talk about that.
robbie,It was nice of you to come.
jessica,I wouldn't have missed it.
robbie,"So, how are things with your dad?"
robbie,"Yeah, probably a good idea.  You were a good baby-sitter, Jessica. I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable."
jessica,Wait: I thought you weren't giving up.
robbie,"I'm not. But I figure: you like my dad, and one day I'll look like my dad, so I'll just come for you then."
jessica,It's a good plan.
jessica,Until then: a little graduation gift. To help get you through high school.
jessica,"You take care, Robbie."
cal,"You okay, buddy?"
