kate,You have your ticket?
jack,"Im not even gonna say it, Kate. Maybe itll be like I never left..."
kate,Wait.
jack,About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
kate, I know weve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
jack,You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
kate,Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
jack,"For us, Kate."
kate,"Right, for us. But...Im afraid that if you get on that plane..."
jack,What?
kate," Go. Im sorry, you should just go..."
jack," No, youre right.  What are we doing?"
kate,We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.
jack," Okay, I'm going..."
kate,I can't seem to let go of you...
jack,You hear me complaining about that?
kate,"You want to do something great, Jack?  Let's flush the plan...start our lives right now, today...I don't know what that life's gonna look like but I do know it has both of us in it.  And I choose us..."
jack,"I love you, Kate..."
paula, I hope you don't mind.  There were like ten new ones in the cabinet.
jack,It's not what you think.  I took Mentadent public...
paula,Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
jack,Of course I did.
paula,Last night was great...
jack,You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
paula,Thanks.  You're not bad yourself...
jack,I want to see you again.
paula,"I'd like that, too."
jack,Tonight.
paula,"It's Christmas Eve, Jack."
jack,So we'll get egg nog.
paula, I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
jack,Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
paula,I'm taking the train...
jack,I've got plenty of places to go.
paula, Okay?
jack, If it's something you feel strongly about.
paula,"It was nice meeting you, Jack..."
jack, Mrs. Peterson.
jack,"Its because Im shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?"
jack,"Howd you do this year, Tony?"
jack,Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
jack,"...if MedTech's shares sink any lower than...  ...forty three, we're in trouble with the stock valuation.  So for god's sake watch what you say to your institutional customers..."
alan,"Sorry, Jack.  I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner.  You know, it being Christmas Eve and all."
jack,Is that tonight?
alan,I don't know.  Maybe...
jack,"Okay, maybe I do have a touch of tunnel vision this holiday season.  But in two days we're going to announce one of the largest mergers in U.S. corporate history.  Thirty billion dollars...  When this kind of deal turns up you get on and you ride it `till it's over.  You don't ask it for a vacation..."
alan,"You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan."
jack,"I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?"
alan,Why Jack?
jack,Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
adelle,"Only eight thirty?  What's the matter, had some last minute shopping to do?"
jack,"You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?"
adelle," You're a ray of sunshine, Jack."
adelle,"Oh, and Oxxford called..."
jack,"Ooh, my suits are ready..."
adelle,Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
jack,Her assistant?
adelle,"Yeah Jack, her assistant..."
jack, Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
adelle, You?  Married?
jack, Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
adelle,Excuse me?
jack,She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
adelle,So you left her?  Just like that?
jack,"God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight..."
adelle,"Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy."
jack,"I took the road less traveled, Adelle."
adelle,And look where it's led you...  I'm gonna get her on the phone...
jack,No...
adelle,No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
jack,"She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing."
lassiter,Eight forty-five on Christmas Eve and Jack Campbell is still at his desk.  There's a Hallmark moment for you...
jack,Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
lassiter, That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
jack,And God love you for it.
lassiter, I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
jack,That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
lassiter,Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
jack,"Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?"
lassiter,"I need you, tiger.."
jack,Where is he?
lassiter,Aspen.
jack, Call Aunt Irma.  Tell her I won't be able to make it tomorrow...
lassiter,"You're a credit to capitalism, Jack."
jack,"Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve..."
lassiter,You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
jack,Not by a long shot.
lassiter,Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
jack, I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
adelle,That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
frank,"Mr. Campbell.  Why didn't you call down, I would've had Joe get your ride."
jack,"I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank."
frank,Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
jack,Thanks.  To you too...
cash,"Oh yeah...yeah, yee-ah!  She's a certified winner...paper- thin but good as gold..."
jack,Egg nog?
sam wong, Dairy case.  Five dollar.
cash," Y'all do the lotto here...? `Cause I got me a winner...I know, I know, Lotto keeps the black man down... but not me..."
sam wong, Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
cash,What're you talkin' about?
sam wong, You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
cash,What!?  Look at the ticket...!
cash,"You're lookin' at me, you're not even lookin' at the ticket!"
sam wong,You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
cash,"You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making..."
sam wong, Get out!
cash,LOOK AT THE GODDAMN TICKET!!
jack, Let me see that ticket.
cash, Was I talkin' to you?!
jack,Maybe I'll buy it from you.
cash,"Guy in $2,000 suit gets ass kicked tryin' to be a hero. Film at eleven...  What?!  Oh no, not another lookie-loo.  You know how big a job this is?"
jack,"Hey, c'mon..."
cash, Do you want to die?
jack,No.
cash, Yes you do...
jack,"Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars."
cash,"Damn, you are the real thing..."
jack,How'd you know my name was Jack?
cash,"I call all you white guys ""Jack."""
jack,There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
cash," A lucky streak, huh?"
jack,I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
cash,"Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off..."
jack,Hey...
cash,"You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person."
jack,"I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back..."
cash,"Yeah, in most cases that'd be true."
jack,"I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities..."
cash," Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?"
jack,Everyone needs something.
cash,Yeah?  What do you need?
jack,Me?
cash,You just said everyone needs something.
jack,I've got everything I need.
cash,Wow.  It must be great being you.  You got it all.
jack,"Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work..."
cash," You still think this is about me, don't you?"
jack,"Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too."
cash,"Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself..."
kate,"Mmmm...ten more minutes, Jack... its Christmas..."
annie,"Jingle bells, Santa s mells, Rudolph laid an egg...la la la, la-la la la, la la la la la..."

cash,"Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack..."
jack, What the hell is happening to me?!
cash,"This kinda thing makes a lotta guys throw up. Seen it happen.  So if you get the urge, do it out the window.  I dont want you marring this exquisite leather interior..."
jack,Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
cash,"No?  Cmon, Jack...Ive got everything I need, I dont have regrets, thats just not for me... sound familiar?"
jack,You mean because you thought I was cocky Im now on a permanent acid trip?!!

cash,"Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of em take a couple seconds...  ...some of em take a lot longer..."
jack,I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!

jack,"Look, I just want my life back.  Now whats it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Lets talk turkey!  How much money...?"
cash,Do I look like I need your money.  It doesnt work like that and I cant tell you why.
jack,Why not?
cash,Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
jack,Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
cash,"Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you."
jack,"Look, I dont have time for this right now.  Im in the middle of a deal... CASH Oh youre working on a new deal now...did I mention that?"
jack,You know what?  Ive had it with you.  Ive had it with all of this shit...

jack,"Were friends, arent we?"
arnie,Maybe I dont say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
jack,Im having kind of a bad day.
arnie, I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
jack,Is it...?
arnie,Trouble at work?
jack,I dont think so.
arnie,"Its not Kate, is it?"
jack,Kates my wife...
arnie," Just keep saying it, Jack, like a mantra."
arnie,"Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isnt the life I dreamt about.  Wheres the romance, wheres the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you cant have..."
jack," Its just two kids, right?"
arnie,"You made a choice, Jack, a promise to your wife. Maybe sometimes it seems like you gave up the world, but look what you got..."
kate, Hold on a second...
jack,You cut your hair...
kate,Ten years ago...
jack,Yeah...fine.
kate," Never mind, he just walked in..."
jack, I dont know!  Please stop yelling at me!
kate,Where were you?

kate,"You know what, Jack? Its not funny this time.  Im really angry."
annie, Whats that?
kate,"You missed the whole thing, Jack.  The pancakes, the presents...you spent six hours putting that bike together and you didnt even get to see the look on Annies face when she opened it..."
jack,Im...Im sorry.
kate,"Look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  Youre not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I dont care how hilarious you think it is..."
jack,"Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party..."
kate,You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?
jack,Trust me on this Kate.  I really dont think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
kate,Fine.  Do whatever you want.
jack,What are you doing?
kate,Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
jack,Why not?
kate,Because youll be here.

bill kramer,"Why not?  I figure Im going in for a cleaning tomorrow, I might as well load up on the fried stuff tonight..."
arnie,"Good thinking, Bill. Have another drink.  Hell be lucky if he lives through the night..."

jack, Do you realize how much money Ive made for that sonuvabitch in the last eight years?!
kate,Are you sure youre okay...?
jack,"Yes, Im fine.  Its just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!"
kate, Uh huh...
kate," ...then she asks me to put this sweater on. What choice do I have, right?"
jack, So youre a lawyer...?
kate, Jack...
jack,"Pro bono.  You dont get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo..."
kate,I better go wake my mother...
jack,Youre kidding me...
kate,"Shes your dog, Jack."
jack,"No, shes not."
kate,"Fine, shes the kids dog.  Lets go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her."

hector," Okay Jack, we talk later..."
big ed,"Jack my boy!  You are looking mighty worse for the wear...Hey, guess who I played bridge with two nights ago...?"
jack,Im gonna have to get back to you on that...Ed.
kenny,Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
jack,Thank you.
jack,Bowlers do it in an alley?...Non profit lawyers do it for free... what is it with these people?  Dont they realize this refers to sex?
estelle," Jack to mag wheels...Jack, youre needed in mag wheels, customer waiting!"
jack,...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
kenny,"No, I didnt...thats great."
jack,Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
kenny,Uh huh...
jack,"I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always..."
kenny,"Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure youre okay?"
jack,"Well, Im just a little confused right now about why I work here..."
kenny,Uh...I just started here last Tuesday.
tommy, So youre all set on the Skip Shift eliminator and the Brembo rotors. Jacks our point man on alloy wheels...
jack, Do you know why do I work here...?
tommy,Because youre the best damn tire guy in the state of New Jersey...  Jack taught me everything I know about the business...
jack,I taught you the business?
tommy,And hes a crack-up.
jack,"Everything I taught you. I want to hear it all, right now."
customer,"Hey, Im ready to buy here..."
jack, What do you want?
customer,I want some alloy wheels.
jack,Here.  These are great. Youll need four.
customer,But I dont like these...
jack,"Hey, you heard the guy, Im the best damn tire guy in the state of New Jersey.  Everything."
tommy,"Okay...  Rule number one, the customer is always right..."
jack," ...I have no idea what our inventory level is, thats why Im asking you..."
big ed,"Got a minute, Jack?"
jack,Ive got all the time in the world...
big ed,"Jack, meet Sydney Potter, BuyRite Transport, one of Jerseys top businessmen..."
jack,...and a helluva bridge player.  Eds told me a lot about you...
potter, Hes a nice looking boy...
big ed,My daughters no slouch either...
potter,"Lets cut to the chase, Jack.  Big Ed tells me youre the grease that makes the wheels turn around here.  I need a new parts supplier for my fleet.  You seem to have the parts.  That we know.  What we dont know is why the hell I should buy them from you."
jack,I have no idea...
big ed, Cmon Jack...
jack," I mean it.  From what I can tell, were a mom and pop operation, were already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier..."
potter,"Okay, you got my attention..."
jack,Except for rule number one...
potter, I like him...
big ed," Cmon, lemme show you the rest of the ranch..."
jack,A Lamaze class...!?
jack,What?!  Thats my deal?
kate,The kids are asleep...
jack, Well thats just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
kate,I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
jack,Im working on a new deal now...
kate,"Fine, but not tonight..."
jack,"Wait a second.  You want me, dont you?"
kate,"That is the general idea, yes..."
jack,Shouldnt we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
kate,"Its ten thirty, Jack. By eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We dont have time for wining and dining."
jack,Whatever you say...honey.
kate,"Thanks, Jack..."
jack,"No, Im serious...youre really stunning..."
kate,"This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming..."
jack,"I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, theres no question about that.  But this...  ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman..."
kate,How can you do that?
jack, Do what?
kate,Look at me like you havent seen me every day for the last twelve years...
kate, Were almost done here...
annie,"Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised."
kate,"Thats right.  Okay, lets make a quick stop at the kids shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then Ill run into the linen store..."
jack,Why dont we just go to all the stores?!
kate,"You know what, Jack?! Ill go with the kids. Why dont you just hang out here in the mens department... okay?"
jack,Its an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  Im gonna buy it...
kate,"$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?"
jack, She got those shoes...
kate,"Those shoes were twenty five dollars.  Cmon, take it off.  Well go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like."
jack,No.
kate,No?
jack,Do you have any idea what my life is like?
kate,Excuse me?
jack,"I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate."
kate,Really.
jack,Whats in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes?
kate,"Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack."
jack,"I cant believe its not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I couldve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!"
kate,Who are you?
jack," Look, Im sorry.  Im sorry I was such a saint before and Im such a prick now.  Maybe Im just not the same guy I was when we got married..."
kate,"Maybe youre not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldnt need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if thats what its gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids college fund."
jack,Forget it...  Well get a funnel cake. Itll be the highlight of my week...
jack," Listen, Im sorry about that back in the store. I really dont want to fight with you..."
kate,"Ill give you this, life has thrown us a few surprises..."
jack,"It really has, hasnt it?  So if you had to...what would you say was the biggest surprise?"
kate,Well...Annie for one.
jack,"Surprise.  Were pregnant...  Yeah...that mustve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?"
kate,"I think it worked out okay, dont you?"
jack,Sure.  I really like Annie.
kate,"Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her."
jack,"No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?"
kate,We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
jack,Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Whyd we ever leave?
kate,You cant really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...
jack,You had a heart attack?
kate, ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.
jack,Thats why I work for Big Ed?
kate,If you want to look at it that way...
jack,How would you look at it?
kate,A great success story...
jack,Damn...
arnie," Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!"
jack,"Hey, Im doing the best I can...  Id like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers..."
arnie,"Youre right.  Why am I so competitive!? Compensation, I guess. Look, just focus, Jack. You can still pick up the spare..."
jack," You are Jack Campbell. Youre better than this sport.  You shot the rapids at Kenai.  You ran with the bulls at Pamplona.  You jumped out of a plane over the Mojave Desert, for Christs sake.  You can do this..."
arnie," Okay, Pete, youre up."
evelyn,Hi Jack...
jack,"Evelyn, right?"
evelyn,Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
jack,Something like that.
evelyn, Need a nurse?
jack,Youre a nurse?
evelyn,If thats what you want...
jack,Wait a second...
evelyn,"Are we what, Jack?"
jack,Is there something going on between us?
evelyn,Are we finally being honest?
jack,It would help me if we were.
evelyn,"Okay, youre right, weve been dancing around this for years..."
jack,Do I have your number?
evelyn,Steves out of town with the kids this week.  Why dont you just stop by...
arnie," Hey Jack, youre all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you."
jack, I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
arnie,She is relentless.
jack,She wants to have an affair with me.
arnie,She said that?
jack,Pretty much.
arnie,Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
jack, So could you write down her exact address?
arnie,"Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?"
jack,It wouldnt really be cheating...  Its complicated.
arnie,"Look, maybe Im not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtations harmless but youre playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever."
jack,"Im telling you, those rules dont apply to me, Arn."
arnie, Screw the rules.  Im talking about the choice.
jack,"Hey, is that really necessary?"
arnie,All Im saying it there isnt a guy in Union County who wouldnt give his left nut to be married to Kate...
kate," How was the game, honey?"
jack," Hey, wheres that chocolate cake...?"
kate, You mean this chocolate cake?
jack,Thats my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
kate,Its good...
jack,Gimme that cake.
kate,No way.
jack,Cmon.
kate,"Sorry, Jack.  Its too important to me."
jack,I want that cake!
kate, You want the cake!?
jack, I want it...
kate,"Its good, right?"
jack,Are the kids asleep?
kate," Say it, Jack..."
jack,What...?
kate,"Cmon, you know what I like to hear..."
jack," Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear..."
kate, Then say it...just say it to me...!
jack," Oh yeah, youre a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...Im gonna take you to that special place..."
kate,What...?
jack,Not it...?
kate,"Nice, Jack.  Youre sweeping me off my feet."
jack,What? You make me hot...
jack," Cmon, girl, lets go home..."
bill kramer,"Four hundred bucks at Best Buy, Arn."
jack,And everyone knows image stabilization is for the weak...
arnie,"So Jack, its your wifes birthday, got anything to say to her?"
jack, Its your birthday? Today?  Whats your name?  Where were you born?
kate,Jack.
jack,Wait a minute.  Youre my wife?
kate," Time to get up, honey..."
kate,"Happy Anniversary, honey..."
jack,Maybe I should wait...
kate,"No, open it..."
jack, Zeena...
kate,"Enjoy it, sweetheart..."
jack,Youre probably expecting something from me...
kate,What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until its light out.
jack,"I know that, but..."
kate,You forgot.
jack,Ill fix it.  Ill go out right now and get you something.  Ill make it right.
kate," Jesus, Jack...Is this where we are now?  Is this our marriage? Suddenly Im the wife who has to drop hints two weeks before her anniversary so her husband doesnt fuck it up?"
jack,Please dont cry...
kate," I dont want to be that, Jack..."
jack,Cmon...cmon...
annie, Put the bicycle back on the ground...
annie,Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
jack,Like what?
annie,One year he had a solar system named after her...
jack,Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
annie,Mom liked it.
jack,Maybe theres a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
annie,Thats good but...you did forget the anniversary.
jack,"Right.  Thats a major oversight...  So if Im Kate...I cant really afford the finer things, my husbands career is a crushing disappointment to me, Im trapped in suburbia..."
annie,Youre really gettin the hang of this.
kate,Which do you think?
annie,The black one...
kate,"Fightings a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?"
annie,"Im not worried, Mom. Hes still learning our ways..."
kate,Cmere.
annie, Really?
kate,Now go like this...
jack,You look beautiful...
kate,You okay?
jack,Fine...
kate, Jack...can we afford all this?
jack,"Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs..."
kate,How do you even know about this place?
jack,"Arnie...  Arnie.  Hell throw you a curve ball once in a while, thats for sure..."
jack,"Well have the tureen of quail breast with shiitake mushrooms to start, then the veal medallions in raspberry truffle sauce and the sea scallops with pureed artichoke hearts...sea scallops, North of the Caspian..."
waiter,"Very good, sir.  And may I say those are all excellent selections."
jack,"You may...  Also, well have a bottle"
kate,"Its five hundred and fifty dollars, Jack!"
jack,Just a glass of red wine for each of us...
kate,"You are so not off the hook yet, slick."
jack,"But Im gettin close, right?"
kate,"I dont think theres dancing here, Jack."
jack,Sure there is...
kate, Pretty good for a tire salesman from Jersey...
jack,I have my moments...
kate,"Mmmm...  ...here, try one of these..."
jack, God I missed that taste...
kate,Okay...
jack,I think it may help us but theres a slight chance it could make things worse.
kate,Now Im worried...just say it.  Whatever it is well deal with it.
jack,Are you sure?
kate,"Worse, you mean..."
jack,"No.  Well, maybe a few things.  But mostly just different..."
kate,And now...?
jack,Now...I dont...
kate,Me neither.
jack,But you always seem so certain.
kate,"Cmon, Jack, you think there arent mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell Im doing in New Jersey..."
jack,"Thats a big one for me, too."
kate,"My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youve seen my pay check."
jack,Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
kate,"I mean yes, I help people that need it..."
jack,I guess...some of them are probably faking.
kate," God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player..."
jack,Its wonderful...
kate,"I think about it, too, Jack.  I do.  I think about the kind of person Id be if I hadnt married you..."
jack,And...?
kate,"And I realize Ive just erased the things in my life Im most sure about.  You, the kids..."
jack,Good things...
kate,What are you sure about?
jack,Im sure that right now theres nowhere Id rather be than here with you...
kate,This is so beautiful...
jack," Happy anniversary, sweetheart."
kate,"I dont know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off."
jack,Im out of the doghouse?
kate,Way out...
jack,Youre so...beautiful...
kate,"I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack..."
jack,"My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you..."
kate, Thats all I wanted to hear...
kate,Mmmm...Jack...
jack,I dont think Id fight you on that one...
kate,Have a good day...
jack,"For the money, theyre hands down the best radial we carry..."
man," Okay, Ill take them..."
jack,You wont regret it...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
kenny, Nice ride...
jack, If youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
kenny,You want me to handle him?  I think Im ready...
jack,"Sure...be careful, he looks like a tough negotiator..."
jack, Tell Kate Ill call her back...
jack, Im with a customer. Ill call her back.
lassiter, I seem to have had some kind of blow out...
jack,"Why dont you let me take this one, Kenny?"
kenny,"Okay, chief."
jack,Peter Lassiter...
lassiter, Do I know you?
jack,Not exactly. Ive seen you on CNBC.  You look taller in real life...
jack,"...truth is, Mintz was so busy timing his wifes breathing he didnt see that MedTech needed Global more than the other way around.  Ten days, two weeks tops, they wouldve approached you with an offer, and Id bet anything it wouldve been thirty billion, not twenty nine...  Problem was, Peter, you had a pussycat running the show. What you needed was a rottweiler."
lassiter," Well, Im impressed."
jack,Sure. Were going to have to special order that tire. Itll be ready in about two days.
lassiter,This has my office address on it...  Why dont you drop it off yourself?
hector,"...I say to her, Margarita, we already have four kids, why do we need more?"
jack, Hector...do I usually listen to your personal problems?
jack,"Look, I have some business that I have to take care of in the city so Im leaving early...  My advice to you...follow your dreams."
lassiter,"...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see..."
jack,But youre not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
mintzs assistant," Hes expecting you, Mr. Lassiter..."
lassiter," Alan, this is Jack Campbell...the one I was telling you about..."
alan,"Jack, of course."
jack, Mr. Mintz.
alan,"Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here..."
jack," I can see that, Alan."
alan,"You have kids, Jack?"
jack," Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones."
alan,Thats great...  Why dont you have a seat?
jack,"I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton."
alan,A broker? Really. And now youre in the tire business?
jack,Thats right. And auto supply...
alan,"Uh huh. The retail end, I understand."
jack,Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
alan,Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
jack,We did one point seven million in total revenue...
alan,Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
jack,"Well, Alan, I think were gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account."
alan,"Really. So youre projecting what, a tad over two million?"
jack,Thats right. And that would make us number one in our market...  You mind if I stand?
alan,"Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack."
jack," Its okay, Alan. I get it. Im in your shoes, Im thinking exactly the same thing...but heres the thing. Business is business.  Wall Street, Main Street, its all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell theyre gonna send their kids to college.  Its just people..."
alan,Im sure you do...
lassiter, Lets let the man have his say...
jack," Take you, for instance..."
alan, What about me?
jack,"You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. Youre an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch..."
lassiter,"He certainly has your number, Alan."
jack," Youre a little tougher, Peter."
lassiter, Thats easy. Youve seen my car.
jack," Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. Youre a scotch man, single malt, not because its trendy but because youve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand..."
lassiter,Oh? And how would you know that?
jack,Because Im here.
lassiter," Alan, why dont you show Jack around a bit..."
alan,Id love to.
alan," ...thats our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile."
jack, Seven.  Really.
alan,"Lets cut the shit, huh Campbell? What, did you go through his wallet or something?"
jack,"God, you really are different, arent you...  I mean...wow...I am impressed."
alan,I dont think youre hearing me.
jack,"Oh, Im hearing you, Alan. Thats not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine.  And I dont care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back...  So do yourself a favor and dont get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office."
jack,Welcome to Xanadu...
kate,Its like a museum.
jack,Think bigger.
kate,For the week?
jack,"This place is a perk, Kate."
kate,A perk for what?
jack,A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
kate,"What are you talking about, Jack?"
jack,"Im going into arbitrage, honey.  Turns out I have a knack for it.  Ill be making two hundred grand a year plus a hefty bonus and thats just to start.  And, we can live in this apartment practically rent free for as long as we want."
kate,Are you out of your mind?
jack,"I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  Well put Annie and Josh in private schools..."
kate,Annie goes to a great school.
jack,"Im talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate..."
kate,"Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?"
jack,"This is New York City, its like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here..."
kate, I cant believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
jack,"No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon."
kate, Jack.
jack,"Look, Im detecting a kind of funky tension here...We dont have to live in this apartment. I dont need this...Ill commute...Ill drive to work..."
kate,In traffic?  Its over an hour each way?  Thats almost three hours a day.  When are you going to see the kids?
jack,"Kate. Youre not understanding me. Im talking about a great life.  A perfect life. Everything we pictured when we were young. The whole package. You said it yourself, life has thrown us surprises, and so we made sacrifices. But now I can finally get us back on track..."
kate,Then get a goddamn snow blower!
jack,"Look, youre making this into something its not. This isnt a referendum on our lives, Kate. Its a step forward...  Dont you see?  Im talking about us finally having a life other people envy."
kate,"They already do envy us, Jack..."
jack,Very nice. What is it?
annie,Mary Had A Little Lamb.
jack,Ah. A classic...
jack,From London to New York...?  I came back...
kate,"Our finest moment, right..."
annie, I knew youd come back...
jack,What are you doing?
annie, Ringing my bell...
jack,Four ninety nine?! Its just salt for gods sake...
jack,You...!
cash,"Jack, its good to see you..."
jack,Im not going back...
teenage girl,Yeah...fine.
jack, Hey! Did you hear me...?!
jack,"Hey, Im talking to you! I am not going back, do you understand...?!"
cash,"Cmon, Jack..."
jack,"Ive got kids, Im going home..."
cash,"You know what the word glimpse means, J? Its by nature an impermanent thing."
jack, Im staying.
annie, Is it morning yet?
jack,"No, honey. Go back to sleep."
kate, Hey...
jack,"These last weeks, Kate, I know that Ive done some...some unusual things."
kate,"Its been interesting, thats for sure."
jack,"But Ive done some good things too, havent I?"
kate,Youve been Jack Campbell.  And thats always a good thing...
jack,"I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens."
kate,"Are you okay, Jack?"
jack,"Please, just promise me youll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you dont, then its like it never happened and I dont think I could live with that."
kate,"I promise, Jack..."
jack,Promise me again...
kate,"I promise. Come to bed, honey."
jack,Soon...
jack," Yeah...okay, send her up..."
paula,"Waiting for me by the door, huh?"
jack,Paula...
paula, Merry Christmas...
jack, Christmas?  It cant be Christmas...
paula," Its whatever you want it to be, Jack..."
man,Can I help you?
jack,Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
man,"Kate? No, theres no one here named Kate.  Is that good enough for you?"
jack,Damn...damn...damn...
man,"Hey, are you okay?"
jack,No...Im not...
man,Is there anything I can do for you?
jack,"Im sorry, no..."
arnie," Hey, you cant park that thing here."
jack," Its me, Jack..."
arnie,"I dont care if youre Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still cant park here."
jack,"Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please..."
arnie,Howd you know my name?
jack,We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
arnie,I never won anything in bowling.
jack,Yes...Jack Campbell...
arnie,"Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youre doing well..."
jack," Yes, thats it...yes, we went to high school together."
arnie,"You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man..."
jack,"Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we couldve been really good friends..."
jack, Hello?
jack,Adelle?
jack,Ill be there in twenty minutes...
alan," Thank god, Jacks here. Ill call you right back..."
jack, Whats going on here?
alan,"Its not good.  Bob Thomas has secretly been talking to a European drug company. Were not sure which one, Julias on it right now. Word is theyre willing to let him buy a minority stake and keep running the entire company.  The Global people are up in arms.  They say we shouldve been prepared for this.  Were in trouble here, Jack..."
jack,"You know something, Alan. Theres a much more assertive person somewhere inside of you..."
alan,Excuse me?
jack,But I think I like you better this way...
alan,Is this another one of those Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?
jack,No.
alan,"So what are we gonna do, Jack?"
jack,"Ill tell you exactly what were going to do.  Youre going to do whatever you have to do to find out which European company hes been talking to.  Then Im going to clean myself up, fly to Aspen, and drink egg nog with Bob Thomas.  His wife and kids will be playing in the background while I spend Christmas day convincing him that the European company is the devil and Global is the answer to his prayers, after all...  Then Im going to spend four hours skiing. Alone. On Christmas day. Completely and utterly alone. Im going to do that because that is my life, that is whats real, and there is nothing I can do to change that..."
jack, For Manhattan...Kate Reynolds...I need an address too...
driver,But the airports the other way...
jack,Were not going to the airport...
lori,Are you from the shipping company?
jack,Im Jack Campbell...Im an old... friend of Kates. I just called.
jack,Kate...
kate,"Jack...God, its been so long...You look..."
jack,You look great.
kate,Its good to see you...
jack, I'm sorry...
kate,"Dont worry about it, Jack..."
jack,Whats going on?
kate, Its a box marked Jack.  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
jack,Paris?
lori, Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
kate,"Hey, kind of under a little pressure here."
lori,"Hey, kind of giving up Christmas day for my ex-boss here."
kate,You didnt seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
lori,Maybe its by the wardrobe boxes...
jack,Youre moving...
kate,Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Im going to be heading it up.
jack," To Paris. Paris, France."
kate, Thats the one...
jack,So youre not at a non- profit firm?
kate, Not with what they pay me...
jack,"Youre not married, are you?"
kate,"No, Jack, I never got married. You?"
jack,Not exactly...  Can we just take a minute here?  Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
lori, Ill go for a cup of coffee!
kate,Yes!
lori,Congratulations. The La Guardia flights canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
kate,Here you go.  Its just some old things of yours...
jack,"Do you ever think about us, Kate?  About what might have happened...?"
kate,Youre serious...
jack,"Sure. Goodbye, Kate."
jack, Kate!
kate,"Jesus, Jack..."
jack,Dont get on that plane!
kate,Jack.
jack,Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
kate,What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
jack, We have a house in Jersey!
kate,"Dont do this, Jack... But he continues..."
jack,"We have two kids, Annie and Josh..."
kate,"Okay, Jack..."
