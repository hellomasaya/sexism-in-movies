Speaker,Dialogue
bierce,"No one can deny the horrendous nature of Mr. Frankenstein's crimes, but in the twenty years he has been with us, I have never seen a patient turn his energies to more productive use."
bierce,"Just look at his accomplishments... three volumes of poetry, two rock operas, a sculpture garden, four romance novels... and who can forget his touching portrayal of Billy Bigelow in our all-psychotic production of ""Carousel""..."
bierce,Directed by our own Doctor Anabel Leek.
casanova,Twenty years ago I was a lost soul. Loveless...  I'm sorry!  I'm SO SO SORRY!
casanova, And don't be afraid of the dark...
casanova, Boom.
casanova,Those gas leaks can be murder.
casanova,I'm home.
big red,Who said crime don't pay?
big red,And what if he rats on us?
big red,Stick a brick in his Pampers and dump him in the lake.
raja,"Not so fast, gentlemen--and I use the term loosely... Unhand that youngster..."
shoveler,Or you're mulch.
big red,What are you guys supposed to be... superheroes?
furious,We ARE superheroes!
big red,Really?  Did you mother make those costumes?
big red,This is our territory.  Beat it.
furious,Over YOUR dead body.
big red,"0ooooo, he's scary."
big red,A fork!
raja,And there's plenty more where that came from.
big red,GET 'EM!
red eyes,"Crush him, Mikey!... Mash him!... Mush him!"
furious, Is that all you got?
red eyes,He wants more!... Squish him!... Finish him off!
furious, Your mother!
red eyes,IT'S CAPTAIN AMAZING!
red eyes,We give!... We're sorry!... We had terrible childhoods!  
raja,"Nice work, Captain."
amazing, Hi. Dawn.
dawn," Looks like you've done it again, Captain."
amazing,It's what I do.
cop 1,"Okay, show's over. Move it. On your way."
raja,"Wait a minute, Officers. You don't understand-- we're superheroes, and we just busted up this gang."
cop 1,Really?  Let me guess-you're Towel Head and he's...  Captain Pooper Scooper!
cop 1,Hey!  Move it!
cop 2,Get a life!
cop 1,And leave crime fighting to the real thing!
cop 1,Wannabes.
cop 2,Pathetic.
raja," He doesn't miss a trick, does he?"
furious,What a jerk--and like nobody knows who he really is!
shoveler,Oh don't start that again--
furious,LOOK!
furious,He's Lance Hunt!  Just take off the glasses-- and it's him!
raja,There's a vague similarity.
furious,A vague similarity?  IT'S THE SAME GUY!
shoveler," 0h, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore.  Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps--and for what?"
raja,We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
shoveler,How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
furious,"We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!"
raja,But look at him... and look at us.
shoveler,The camera loves him.
raja,"I lost another fork tonight.  She's getting suspicious, I know it."
furious,So why don't you just tell her!
raja,I can't.
furious,Why not?
raja, Because I can't!  Okay?  She wouldn't understand!
shoveler,"Leave him alone.  She's his mother, not yours."
furious,"We had an off night, that's all."
shoveler,So when are we gonna have an on night?
waitress,Hi.
raja,You're... new.
waitress,It's my first night.  My name's Monica.
monica,You guys going to a costume party?
raja,We're superheroes.
monica,Really?  Like Captain Amazing?
monica,Are you famous?
raja,Not yet.
monica,So you're like... struggling superheroes?
raja,"We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... "
monica,Wow.
raja,"And these are my associatiates, the Shoveler."
shoveler,Hi.
raja,And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
monica, Really?
raja,"Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill.  In his case, it's entirely emotional."
monica,So what can I get you?
raja,Burgers all around.  Rare. (meaning Furious} Raw.
raja,She likes you.
shoveler,Definitely.
raja,Ask her out.
furious,Nah.
raja,"Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?"
furious, And then they dump you.
raja,So you're chicken?
furious,Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
monica,I guess... Are you always so angry?
furious,Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?
furious,Want to go out and get drunk?
furious,Or talk?
monica,Not tonight. 
raja,Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
furious, Like what?  Cutting off my own ear?
raja,Or flowers.
furious,See ya tomorrow.
shoveler,"Hey, when are you guys gonna clean this place up?"
tracy,When you're on TV.
lenore,Save any babies lately?
tracy,Faster than a speeding turtle--
butch,More powerful than a deodorant--
lenore,"Look, snoring in his chair--"
all,It's... Supergut!
lucille," Rough night, Eddie?"
mother,Jeffrey!
raja,"Oh hi, Mom."
mother,What are you doing in the silver drawer?
raja,Looking for... the TV Guide.
mother,It's on the television.
raja,"Of course.  I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy. Go to bed."
furious,"Amazing?  What's so amazing about him?  I'd be amazing, too, if I'd inherited two hundred million bucks... or two bucks... or two cents...  Who am I kidding?  Dreams don't come true."
furious,Where's he going? 
amazing, Uh-huh.
casanova,I hope you enjoy these cigars.  I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
casanova,Have you considered my offer?
casanova,I got it.
casanova,I knew you'd cone.  I left that skylight open for you.
amazing,I know you did.
casanova,I knew you'd know.
amazing,I know you knew I'd know.
casanova,But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
amazing,Of course.
amazing,"I'd hate to waste a good bullet on a piece of scum like you, Tony."
amazing,"The jig is up, Casanova.  I've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to."
casanova,Really?
amazing,I know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...
amazing,I know who your girlfriend really is...
amazing,And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
casanova,"I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?"
amazing,Um-hmm.
casanova,Except for one little thing.
amazing, And what's that?
casanova,That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
amazing,What--?
boss,"YO! CAPTAIN SOMINEX!  Get your shut-eye at home, or you'll be a full time superhero!"
anthony,It's all within your power.  The only thing that's in your way is YOU!
raja,Easy for you to say.
sally,"Hey, Roy!"
sally,How many times I gotta tell you about this?
furious,"Sally, that's a Herkimer Battle Jitney!  They don't make 'em like that anymore.  It's a classic!"
sally,It's a hunk of junk.  I want the iron.  Do it!
radio announcer,"...and continues to deny any knowledge of the incident... In local news, millionaire Lance Hunt has apparently disappeared..."
radio announcer,"Members at his household told police that the playboy philanthropist failed to return home last night after ""going out for a walk"". Police say they have no reason yet to suspect foul play, but a search is under way..."
furious,I saw him go in--and he didn't come out!
raja,But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
shoveler,"Hey, look."
casanova,"Well, Don, I've done some terrible things in my life, but now I'm cured, and I just want to give back something to my old home town... That's why I'm using what's left of my fortune to build..."
don,"You've changed, haven't you?"
casanova,Oh yes.
furious,No he hasn't.
furious, Let's go.
raja, Wait!... Look!
raja,This is bad.
shoveler,Who are they?
raja,The Disco Boys.
furious,The who?
raja,The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced.  Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard.  But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
furious,Well they've crawled back out.
shoveler,We may be getting in over our heads here.
raja,This looks like a job for Superman--
shoveler,Or Batman--
raja,Or both.
furious,"Don't you guys get it?  If Captain Amazing is still in there, we can rescue him--and get on TV! "
casanova,Everything's going exactly as we planned.
anabel, Not quite.  You haven't announced our engagement yet.
casanova,It must have slipped my mind.
anabel,Your mind is so slippery.
casanova,"Don't worry, Pootchkie.  My womanizing days are over.  You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my Nicole. "
raja,Don't crunch the leaves.
shoveler,Sorry.
raja,Be a Mohican. 
furious,Wait.  I hear something.
raja,I'm soaked.  Oh great.
furious,Shhh.
shoveler,Be a Mohican.
raja,Shut up.
furious,Come on.
raja,Uh-oh.
raja,Oh I'm sorry.  We must have the wrong house.
casanova,Hi there.
casanova,Superheroes.
casanova, Why bother?
monica,Here you go. 
raja,Ow.
monica,Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something.
fussy custorer,Miss!
raja,Maybe she's right.
furious, Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
shoveler,What are you talking about?
furious,What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
raja,Agents?
furious,"Archenemies!  Casanova isn't just a criminal-- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune--and babes!"
shoveler,And it would be the right thing to do.
furious," Yeah yeah--and that, too."
raja,"But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal."
furious,Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... 
shoveler,I'm liking this.
furious,I say we send out the word--and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
raja," Yeah, but... who do we know?"
furious,Well... there's the Spleen.
raja,Do we have to?
shoveler,"I got this cousin.  He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible."
furious,Have you ever seen him?
shoveler,How could I see him if he's invisible?
raja,And there's the Sphinx.
shoveler,The who?
raja,He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
furious,Sounds good.
raja,"No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station."
shoveler,Get outta here.
furious,You sure that's how you spell it?
shoveler,Yeah.
furious,"So, let me get this straight.  You have the power to become invisible."
invisible boy,Yes.
raja,But... only when no one is looking.
invisible boy,Yes.
furious,"If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again."
invisible boy,Yes.
raja,So you're only invisible... to yourself?
invisible boy,No.
our heroes, No?
invisible boy,"If I look at myseif, I become visible."
raja,"So you're only invisible, when abuolutely no one is looking at you?"
invisible boy,Yes.
furious,So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
invisible boy,I just know.
furious,"Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview--"
invisible boy," I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?"
spleen,Boy I can't tell you how thrilled I was when you guys called--You gonna eat that pickle?  I've always dreamed of being a member of the a real superhero team--and to have friends--real friends--I mean guys I could live with--sleep with--die with--eat with...
spleen,I love mustard.
invisible boy,So what exactly is your superpower?
spleen,"Well, when I was a kid I grew up on Love Canal- -remember that?--and my brothers and I used to go swimming in it--make Kool-Aid out of it-- stuff like that.  Anyway my brothers all died, but I lived, and I grew all these like weird organs that have never been seen in humans before.  So now I can do things like this!"
spleen,"Cool, huh?"
spleen,"Sorry, sorry."
shoveler,"Hey, why don't you just put a cork in it?"
spleen,I tried that once.  The cork melted.
shoveler,There's just not enough of us.
furious,"But we know they're out there. Hundreds--maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause..."
raja,And a social life.
shoveler,"Yeah, but how do we get to them?"
spleen,Obscene phone calls?
monica,Why don't you throw a barbecue? 
spleen,Come on in!  The water's great!
butch," Great picnic, Dad."
roland,Are these guys real superheroes?
lenore,They think so.
roland,But where's Captain Amazing?
spleen,"Hey, these pool mints are delicious!"
raja,Maybe there was traffic.
furious,Who are we kidding?  No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
invisible boy,"Come on, guys--we're fighting against evil."
furious,"Good or evil, what's the difference?"
shoveler,There's a big difference.
furious,I used to believe that.  Now I'm not so sure.
raja,"Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you."
furious,Oh shut up.
invisible boy,They're here!
their leader,"Hey, man, is this the superhero wingding?"
raja,This is it.  Come on in!
superheroes,All right!  Party!  
raja,"I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware."
their leader,"I am Squeegee Man, and these are my compadres, the Invincible Dudes!"
invincible dudes,Whoa!  Brews!  Party!  
raja,"Would you mind filling out these forms; names, addresses, description of superpowers, that sort of thing."
invincible dudes,"Sure, dude.  No problem.  "
raja,"Actually we lied about the babes, but there's plenty of burgers."
invincible dudes,"That's false advertising!... We came all the way from South Champion, man!  We coulda gone plinking!... We coulda gone bunqee jumping!"
squeegee man,No babes.  No peace.
squeegee man,Let's trash the place!
invincible dudes,Yeah!
furious,"If you're a superhero, what's your power?"
squeegee man,I am Squeegee Man.  Touch my squeegee... and you die.
furious,Can you fly?
squeegee man,No.
furious,Wanna bet?
invincible dudes,Let's get out of here!... That dude's crazy!
raja,Who are you?
bowler,I'm the Bowler.
shoveler,The Bowler?  I remember him from when I was a kid.  He was killed years ago.
bowler,I'm his daughter.
shoveler,"Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing."
bowler,Really?
bowler,Good ball.
bowler,"If it could zip up its own bag, then you'd be impressed, right?"
furious,Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
bowler,I thought you'd never ask.
bowler,"And then one day, he didn't come home.  The police said it was an accident.  But cargo containers don't just fall on people.  He was murdered... After that I fell apart.  I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk.  When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do."
shoveler,So who killed him?
bowler,The Disco Boys.
furious,You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
shoveler,But there's still only six of us.
furious,SO WHAT?
bowler,That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
furious,Half a Dirty Dozen!
spleen,Twice the Three Stooges!
invisible boy,And only one short of the Magnificent Seven.
raja,And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
bowler,He was cute though.
raja,But they all had one thing we haven't got.
spleen,Girlfriends?
raja,A name.  All the great superhero teams have got a fabulous name.
bowler,How about... the Savage Six?
raja,The Inscrutable Six?
spleen,The Six Pistols?
shoveler,The Exterminators!
invisible boy,The Obliterators!
raja,The Eradicators!
bowler,The Emasculators!
spleen,Wait--I got it!... The Spleen Team.
furious,To hell with a name.  Let's get to work.
furious,Let's say hello.
casanova,Nice car.
furious,What did you do with Captain Amazing?
casanova,Captain who?
bowler,I'm his daughter.
furious,'SCUSE ME!
tony,Waste him!
furious,Shall I check your oil?
furious,Looks fine.
furious,NICE CAR!
casanova, That boy's got talent.
shoveler,To us!
raja,Whatever our name is.
shoveler,Even his snores smell bad.
bowler,But she's your mother.  You gotta tell her.
raja,I can't.
invisible boy,Dad thinks all this superhero stuff is a stupid waste of time.
shoveler,"But he plays golf, right?"
invisible boy,Yeah.
raja,"I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine.  Law."
bowler,But you're a superhero.
raja,The cape.  The turban.  She wouldn't understand.
bowler,I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask.  They thought I'd lost it.
raja,But in fact... you'd found it.
shoveler,This is your dream... and you can't ever give it up.
invisible boy,I wonder what he dreams about?
shoveler,We don't want to know.
bowler,It's late.  I'm headin' home.
raja,"Me, too."
bowler," Come on, Junior, it's a school night."
furious,Anybody up for a little White Castle?
furious,Disco sucks.
furious,You're the Sphinx.
sphinx,And you are a fool.
sphinx,You call yourselves superheroes? A rooster fights more intelligently than you!  You have shown yourself to your enemy and revealed your powers to him--and what have you accouplished for this?  You have destroyed his car. Brilliant!  If you want to survive you must fight like a wolf pack--not like a six pack!
sphinx,"The wolf is cunning.  He knows that stealth is his greatest weapon, and he always fights as a team... "
sphinx,Casanova Frankenstein is a a master of evil. You will need more than shovels and dessert forks to stop him... What else have you got?
furious, So what else has Superman got?
shoveler,He's got the fact that he's Superman!
bowler,Bullets bounce off him!
raja,Firepower costs money.
invisible boy,Anybody got any?
shoveler,We didn't think this through very well.
bowler, My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
shoveler,Are you sure he's still lives here?
raja,Are you sure he's still alive?
bowler,He was the last time I saw him.
shoveler,When was that?
bowler,I was eight.
heller,Yes!
bowler,Doctor Heller?
heller, Yes!
bowler,It's me... Elizabeth.
heller,Elizabeth!  Little Elizabeth!  Why you're so... middle aged!
bowler,Thanks.
heller,How's your dad?
bowler,He's dead.
heller,Oh that's right--they squished him...  Heck of a guy.
bowler,"Doc, these are my friends.  We're superheroes, and we need your help."
heller,"Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers--"
sphinx,"Doctor, we need your weapons."
heller, My weapons? You need my weapons?
heller,"The military establishment has never understood me.  They won't return my phone calls, much less field test anything.  But I knew that someday I'd get my chance, and now... here you are! "
raja,"But, Doc... where's the machine guns?"
shoveler,The bazookas?
invisible boy,The lasers?
heller,"You don't need that junk!  You see, for thousands of years mankind has been immolating, disemboweling, and exploding itself.  Why? Because we have this built-in screwed up need to go to war! "
heller,Now here's a beauty!  I call it the Shrinker!  I developed it after years of studying the worst dry cleaners I could find.  It instantly shrinks fabrics to half their size.  Anyone caught in its spray is immediately immobilized by their own clothing!
furious,Let's get out of here.
bowler,"Hey, Mister Bad Mood."
bowler, Catch.
heller,He's got the air cannon!
furious,"Doc, you're a genius! "
heller,I know.
furious," Okay! We got the firepower!  I say we throw it into the car, drive over to Casanova's house, and kick some ass!"
sphinx,No.
sphinx,We are not yet ready.  Now we must learn to fight together... as one thing.
raja,"Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king."
shoveler,Crime was rampant.  It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
bowler,Much less go outside.
shoveler,Then Captain Amazing appeared.
raja,He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
shoveler,And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
furious," But now Casanova's back!  And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!"
sphinx,The wise snake coils before he strikes.
furious, And a skunk stinks!
sphinx,You drink too much.
furious,When are you going to take off that mask?
sphinx, When I am sure I am among friends.
raja,Roy--
furious," Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!"
sphinx,"Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart."
furious,My heart died a long time ago.
sphinx,It is not dead.  It is hiding.
furious,"Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects.  I didn't need you before-- and I don't need you now! "
bowler,Has he always been like this?
mother, Oh this place looks great.
mother,"Now honey, you just wait in the car.  Mommy and Daddy will be right beck."
little furious,Pow!  Bang!  Wham!
mother,It's nice and cool in here.
father," Barkeep, a couple of cold ones."
bartender,And here's a banana for your monkey.
bartender,Couple more?
father,You bet.
little furious,Mommy!  Daddy!  Mommy!  Daddy!
mother,OH MY GOD!
mother,Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Oh my God!
furious,Hi.
monica,Alone tonight?
furious,Every night.
spleen, Bug repellent?
spleen, Kid!
dawn,"...still no sign of millionaire Lance Hunt, and now, in an unrelated story, another one of Champion City's leading citizens has apparently disappeared. Captain Amazing has not been seen or heard from in a week. Authorities believe that the hard working superhero may just be taking a well deserved rest."
don,Cancun perhaps?
dawn,"Sounds good to me, Don."
furious, Monica... I was wondering if--uh-maybe we--I mean you and I--could-uh--you know--get a--I mean have a...
monica,Date?
furious,Yeah.
monica,I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
furious,Sure.
monica,That was easy. 
casanova,"Honey, our ship's come in."
disco boy,Just give me the word.
anabel, Where are you going?
casanova,Head hunting.
monica,I admire you.
furious,Why?
monica,"Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish."
furious,It is?
monica,"Most people just want to make money or be famous or something.  But you risk everything, just to help people."
furious, I wouldn't mind being famous.
monica,Who wouldn't?
monica,"I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress."
furious,Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
monica,What's your real name?
furious,Roy.
monica,Have you always lived here?
monica,Me too... I love this stupid old town.  It's noisy.  It's smelly. It's falling apart.
furious,It's home.
monica,Yeah.
monica,"I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but..."
furious,What have they got that we ain't got?
monica,"Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does."
furious,"Me, too."
monica,You don't seem very angry right now.
monica,You know what?  Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
furious,I just want to be a superhero.
monica,"That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy."
casanova,Going my way?
casanova,Take it easy--take it easy.  I just want to have a little chat... That was quite a number you did on my car.  You've got a lot of violence in you... and I like that in a guy.
casanova,"You know what the difference is between good and evil, Roy?"
casanova,"Evil is more fun.  When you want something, you just take it, and if somebody gets in your way, you kill them... You seem like a very frustrated guy, Roy.  Unhappy. Unfulfilled. What is it that you've always wanted, always desired?  Because whatever it is, I can give it to you... Fame?  The easiest of all."
casanova,"I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy.  In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it.  It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?"
furious, You're nuts.
casanova, They always call the great ones nuts.
furious,And the nuts always call themselves great.
casanova, Are you with me... or against me?
furious,Against.
casanova,Too bad.  PLUG HIM!
casanova,WAIT!
furious, Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
casanova,You're dead.
furious,So are you!
anabel,Be careful with my baby.
guard 1,Freeze!
guard 2,Hands up!
guard 2,What are you two doing here?
guard 1,"Not talking, eh?  That can be fixed.  Turn around, start walking up the hill--"
guard 2,And no funny business.
spleen, Pinch 'em.
invisible boy,Whatever was in that crate... is from Russia.
furious,I was wrong... I need my friends.
sphinx,Amigo.
furious,Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
bowler,What did he mean?
furious,I dunno.
shoveler,Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
raja,But how do we get in?
furious, We just become like the wolf... who wears the sheep's clothing.
raja,So where's the art?
furious,He hasn't stolen it yet.
shoveler,This place is built like a fortress.
furious,Because thats what it is.
raja,What's that?
furious, Come on.
raja, Oh my God... Every crook in the city is here.
casanova,Excuse me.
casanova, Monica... Beautiful name.  It suits you.
casanova,"I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in ""The Blue Dahlia""."
monica,Really?
casanova,Are you an actress?
monica,Just a waitress.
casanova,You underestimate yourself.
casanova,"You know I'm writing a play--it's just a little Broadway thing, but thure's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for."
monica,Really?
casanova,I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
monica,Sure--I guess.
casanova,Terrific.
casanova,What are you three doing here? This is invited guests only.  Out.
raja,That was too close.
shoveler,But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
furious,Hey.
furious,It's me.
monica,What are you guys doing here?
casanova,Thank you all for coming.  I hope you enjoy the cigars.  I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
casanova,"Twenty years ago, this town was yours!  AND I WAS YOUR KING!"
casanova," But they called me a psycho, and they put me away.  For twenty years I rotted in my cell, painting watercolors, writing haikus--just waiting for the day I could take my revenge. Well, brothers, that day has come!"
casanova,"They thought I was crazy? Well the joke's on them--because tonight at precisely midnight--on the twentieth anniversary of my tragic arrest-- every man, woman, and child in this city is going to turn into a RAVING PSYCSOTIC!  Mothers will murder their tots!  Old ladies will strangle their cats!  Children will bump off their babysitters!"
italian ice,You're outta your mind!
casanova,I beg your pardon?
italian ice,Nobody could drive a whole city crazy.
casanova,"Tell you what, Ice.  I'll mke you a friendly little wager.  It I can't do it... you can blow my brains out.  If I can, I'll blow out yours."
italian ice,Done.
casanova," Honey, give the boys a taste."
crooks,That was great!... What the hell was that?... How did you do that?
casanova,"Tonight, at midnight, that sound will be amplified across this entire city.  Murder and mayhem will reign supreme!  And Champion City will be ours again!  This will be our castle! And I will be our king!  And there's no one to stop us!"
casanova,"Don't worry, fellas...  I killed him... and I've had him stuffed."
amazing," Oh, my abs are killing me!"
monica,What could have made such a horrible noise?
heller, He's got the Psychostridulator.
all,The what?
heller,"Ten years ago the Kremlin's top secret Psychiatric Warfare Division developed a prototype for a weapon that emitted a fluctuating alternative frequency noise that produced a violent psychotic reaction in any mammal within hearing distance.  But when the old Soviet Union fell the stridulator and its brilliant inventor, Doctor Kopov, disappeared."
shoveler,"This Kopov, what happened to him?"
heller,Not him... her.
bowler,Did she look like that?
heller,Yes.
spleen, Maybe it won't work.
furious,It works.
heller,A village in Siberia was wiped out when a cleaning woman switched it on by mistake.
monica,We've got to warn the city.
shoveler,How?
raja,No one will believe us.
bowler,They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
furious, We know what we gotta do.
raja,We're outnumbered twenty to one.
shoveler,It's suicide.
furious,"Maybe.  But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny..."
furious,"And smell a little funny.  We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes--and that means doing what's right- -even when it's impossible... This is our city- -these are our friends, our famlies--and if we don't save them, nobody will!  So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob-- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!"
sphinx,Now you're talking.
bowler,Sounds good to me.
raja,Let's do it.
shoveler,And we'll take a bunch of 'em with us!
monica,"I just want you guys to know--I may not be a superhero, but I'm with you--and I want to help!"
all,"Oh that's great... Thanks, Monica...  "
bowler,We could really use some coffee--
shoveler,And some sandwiches--
spleen,With mustard!
monica, Sure.
raja,But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is--
bowler,Or even what it looks like.
heller,And he must have it well hidden.
furious,We'll just have to get lucky.
furious,Go do what you gotta do.  We'll meet back here at sunset... Do or die.
all,Do or die.
sphinx,Victoria o morte.
sally,HEY!
shoveler,"Baby, if I don't make it... find yourself... a normal guy."
lucille,I don't want a normal guy.
mother,"Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!"
raja,Mother... it's not what you think!
mother,And why are you wearing that silly costume?
raja, Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
raja,"Oh, Mother, I'm sorry.  I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family--but it's just not who I am!"
mother,But... the silverware?
raja,I use it... to fight evil.
mother, Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
raja, It is?
mother,I always knew that you were special.
raja,You did?
mother,Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
mother,This is for you.
mother,Your Great Great Grandmother's wedding silver.
raja,Bitchin'.
furious,Try it again!
furious,"Come on, baby... Come on, baby... I SAID COME ON!"
bowler,"Mon Capitan, it's for you. "
furious,Hello?
monica, It's me.
furious,"Monica, where are you?"
monica,At the Frankenstein Center.
furious,Are you nuts?  Get out of there!
monica,I'm going inside.
furious,What are you talking about?
monica,"Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it.  Maybe--just maybe--I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing."
furious,He's a psycho!  He'll kill you!
monica,Just shut up and listen.  Hold off the attack as long as you can.  If I can discover the location I'll call you--
furious,And what if you get killed?
monica,"Then at least I will have died trying, right?"
monica,"Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now...  I think you're wonderful."
furious, What?
monica,Bye. 
furious,Monica!
monica,Could you tell Mr. Frankenstein that Monica is here?
guard,"Sure, doll."
bowler, Hey... you okay?
furious,Sure.
monica,Hi.
casanova,I thought you'd chickened out on me.
monica,Just wanted to... powder my nose.
monica,"How 'bout giving me ""the tour""?"
casanova,Why not?
casanova,"Big, isn't it?"
casanova,Don't worry.  It's not activated.
monica,Who's the artist?
casanova,Me.
furious,Listen.  He's lonely... and he doesn't care who knows it.
furious,"We're all the same really.  Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. "
sphinx,He is in love.  His anger is gone.
raja,Oh no.
shoveler,Great timing!
furious,Has Monica called?
casanova,This is where I come to... be alone.
monica,"Oh, look at that view."
heller,Snap out of it!
bowler,Get on to yourself!
shoveler, GET MAD!
furious,But I just don't feel it.
raja,He's turned into a completely normal person!
furious,"Normal.  What's normal?  Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?"
furious,"You know, Eddie, that was really uncalled for."
monica,I'm chilly.
spleen,Look!  Your favorite sunglasses! 
bowler,Your Roy Rogers coffee mug! 
shoveler,Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
furious,"Okay, you win.  I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved."
casanova,Come here.
monica,I'm not that kind of girl.
casanova,Then why are you here?
monica,Curiosity.
casanova, Remember the cat.
anabel,What are you doing all alone in the dark?
casanova,Fantasizing... about you.
casanova,I thought you were done?
anabel,One last tweak.
raja,"If this doesn't do it, nothing will!"
bowler,It's working!
furious,This music is just SO BEAUTIFUL!
shoveler,It's time.
raja,"With or without him, we gotta go!"
anabel,Our guests are waiting.
casanova,I'll be down in a jiffy.
monica,I'd better go.
casanova,You're a spy.
monica, What?
casanova,I saw him walk you home.
monica,Who?
casanova,Roy.
casanova,Don't be afraid... I never hit a lady...
monica,Stay away!
casanova,Or you'll what?  CAN ME?
casanova,That bitch!
furious,But she still might call!
shoveler,Are you coming or not?
furious,I'll drive.
shoveler,Not a chance!
monica,"Come on, guys... Pick up..."
casanova's voice,What's the matter...
casanova,Nobody home?
shoveler,Here we go!
shoveler,We've got lift off!
raja,May the forks be with us!
raja,First is good.
casanova,I want her alive.
guards,"Yes, Mr. Frankenstein."
little boy,"Daddy, what is that thing?"
father,"I don't know, son."
drunk,A Herkimer?  Those yuppies will drive anything.
sphinx,"Amigo, we need you."
invisible boy,Just GET MAD!
casanova,"Fellas, this is woman without whom I would have gone sane. "
guard 1,What the hell is that?
guard 2,Looks like... a Ford Dumpster.
guards,HEY!
shoveler,Hang on!
casanova,It's showtime.
guard,"Mr. Frankenstein, we're being attacked."
casanova,By whom?
shoveler,"Come on, baby!"
bowler,"Do it, big boy!"
shoveler,"Atta, girl!"
bowler,"Atta, boy!"
casanova,Well kill them.
shoveler,Where am I going?
raja, Through there!
shoveler,Right.
shoveler,No good!  She's dead!
furious,Cover me!
shoveler,With what?
raja,Not bad for a normal guy!
sphinx,Amigos!
all,Do or die!
heller,Wait!  Look!
heller,Laser eye... and it's a humdinger.
raja,No problem.
shoveler,"Doc, there's got to be a way."
monica's voice,It's up here!  It's up here!
furious, Monica!
monica,ROY!  THE PSYCHO THING IS--!
casanova,"Thanks, Roy!  She's just my type. You can have her back... when I'm done!"
heller,He'll never make it.
bowler,Think positive.
invisible boy, I can do it.
casanova, Some girls just know how to die.
anabel,You two timing psychotic bastard.
casanova,"Darling, you've got the wrong idea."
anabel, Do I?
casanova,"I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night.  It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for.  She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you.  I worship you.  I want to make you my bride."
casanova,There's just one thing...  I don't need you anymore.
casanova,"Don't worry, Darling.  I never hit a lady."
bowler,Heads up!
invisible boy,"Guys, I did it! I did it!  I'm invisible!"
invisible boy,Can you see me?
all,Yes!
invisible boy,Nuts.
shoveler,"Kid, turn that thing off!"
invisible boy,HEY! CREEPS!
shoveler,This is it!  DO OR DIE!
casanova,And the light goes out...
casanova,Roy... What took you so long?
casanova,Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
furious,They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
casanova,"Smarts, doesn't it?... Shall we dance?"
disco boys,Help!... Get me out of this! 
casanova,"Roy, you're making this too easy."
bowler, Daddy says hello.
casanova,Let's change the tune.
casanova,WHAT A RUSH! 
furious, Is... that... all you got?
furious,Nice dancing with you.
furious,Monica...
monica,You're beautiful when you're angry.
raja,Mama!
raja,I'm home.
don,Few details have emerged...
kids,Dad!... Dad!... You okay?... You hurt?
shoveler, I'm okay--I'm all right.
lenore,"I'll hold your shovel, Dad."
butch,"You want a soda, Dad?"
shoveler, Okay.
roland,Nice work. Dad.
shoveler,"Thanks, Roland."
roland,"You really are a superhero, aren't you?"
shoveler,And that's when the engine blew up.
kids,Whoa...
butch,What did you do?
shoveler,Well...
doc heller,So you're never actually conscious of range or trajectory?
raja,Heck no.  I just chuck 'em.
dawn,It's been twenty-four hours since the deadly psycho-sonic attack and bloody shoot-out that left Casanova Frankenstein and dozen of the city's top hoodlums dead... But tonight the question remains... Who were these heroic mystery men who saved our city?...
bowler,Could have been anybody.
raja,Wait a minute... That's it.  That's our name. We're... the Mystery Men.
bowler,"Hey, do I look like a Man?"
shoveler,Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
spleen," Mystery, Mystery Man... I want to be a Mystery Man..."
bowler,Eat your mustard.
furious,It doesn't matter what we call ourselves.  We know who we are.
raja,"Yes, Obie-wan."
invisible boy,Hey... he's gone.
raja,"""Until you need me again... Adios."""
shoveler,I miss him already.
furious,"Amigos, duty calls."
patron,Miss... who are those guys?
monica, I don't know.
