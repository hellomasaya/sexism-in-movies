Speaker,Dialogue
forster,"Does that mean you -- He's interrupted as Mr. Wing COUGHS -- a rattling spasm that sounds deeply unhealthy. When the coughing subsides, he answers Forster."
forster,"Keep the TV. As Mr. Wing walks Clamp's men to the door in b.g., HOLD on the TV set -- and a small, furry PAW that reaches into FRAME to change the TV CHANNEL. With the change of stations, the TV screen fills with a SCENE from a Rambo picture. SYLVESTER STALLONE addresses the movie"
stallone,"To survive a war... you've got to become war. Then he screws an explosive-filled metal ARROWHEAD onto an arrow, and SHOOTS the arrow from a bow. The arrow hits a HELICOPTER, which bursts into FLAMES."
cd,"As he starts COUGHING again,"
bodyguard,"I'm sorry that didn't work out, sir. I thought he'd like the TV."
forster,You hear that cough? The guy must be eighty -- maybe ninety. We can wait.
producer,"""is Then we go to the boss -- The video IMAGE SWITCHES to Clamp being interviewed behind his spotless, high-tech desk."
reporter,"That old guy had some neat stuff in his store. You think they'll auction it off, or...?"
producer,Nash...I hear they're just gonna tear it down.
kate,"I should be finished by six tonight. If we go straight from work, we can make the Early Bird Special at the movies."
billy,"It's going to be close. Maybe we could do it tomorrow -- no, tomorrow's when the Futtermans are"
kate,"Mister Futterman must be getting better, if he can travel."
billy,His wife says he's getting better. He's just been -- rattled.
kate,I guess having a bunch of monsters drive a snow plow through jour living room could kind of that to you. He almost got kied.
billy,"Right. (checks his watc4LI We're gonna be late,"
taxi driver,You goin' a' the airport?
billy,"No, the -- The taxi ROARS away -- Billy lets go of the door handle just in time."
kate,Billy...I don't think we're getting the hang of New York.
billy,"I'll try and get out early tonight. I have to finish that drawing of the Chinatown building...  You know, I -had the whole thing just right they're making we take twent p ies off the World Trade Center ofjbVilding looks bigger. Z? F"
kate,"A lot of people aren't as thered by that kind of thing as you are, Billy."
billy,"Yeah, no kidding...I don't think I'm getting that promotion this year."
kate,That's okay. We don't have to wait.
billy,"Yeah we do. It wouldn't feel right, getting married on the money I'm making now. It's bad enough that you got me the job --"
kate,"I didn't get you the job, I just heard about it. Billy, you can get promoted and stuff if you want to, but you have to act like you deserve it. Let people know you're there."
billy,"Want to try the revolving doors today? Before Kate can answer, a WORKER enters one of the revolving doors. The power-assisted door, going too fast, WHOOSHES him inside, and we HEAR --"
kate,Uh-uh. They use a regular door instead.
doreen,".hope you've enjoyed your tour of the world's most modern automated office building. Don't forget, copies of Mr. Clamp's best-selling book, I Took Manhattan, are on sale at the newsstand..."
kate,Don't let things get to you.
billy,I Won't.
for,Yes sir.
forster,"Yes sir. I'm doing a decor compliance check this morning. Tonight I'm doing a random drug search, and -- He's interrupted as an aging MAN IN A DRACULA COSTUME  comes over to the cabinet and tries to address Clamp over the TV hookup."
grandpa fred,"Excuse me. Mister Clamp, could I speak with you for a --"
forster,We're busy.
grandpa fred,I just need a -- Forster snaps the cabinet shut.
forster,"I said -- we're busy.  16 ANGLE - BILLY AT ELEVATORS 16 As the elevator doors open, Billy is joined by MARLA, the chain-smoking, New Yorked-out head of his department."
marla,Billy --
billy,"Hi, Marla, how --"
marla,Your Chinatown drawing. We have to have it. It's a crisis panic emergency. The printers are killing us --
billy,"Yeah, I just have to -- They get on the elevator, with other WORKERS. The doors close."
marla worker,I've got thirty-  screaming at me for -- Sixt--
worker," No, no, not thirty--"
billy, Don't -- But it's too late.
marla,"0  I hate this thing. The elevator stops at their floor, and the doors open. Billy follows Marla out into 18 INT. OFFICE AREA.----''s 18 The advertising department of Daniel Clamp's empire occupies modern, ""open-plan"" offices -- endless beige partitions form tiny CUBICLES full of ""ergonomic"" furniture. Unseen speakers pipe in ""WHITE NOISE"" -- low-volume static to insulate conversations."
marla,"Listen, this deadline. Its not my fault. They're making me miserable so I have to make you miserable. It's a complete heart attack disaster horgor story. As Billy and Marla walk, t ass a WORKER who's -t4ing to get a drink from the d ar ygr WATER_ When he pushes the button, the f ain'ss ,got' VERSHOOTS by several inches, SPLASHING onto The worker contorts himself to get, a drink,,b is face SPLASHED when the fountain surges. Billy and Marla a4lie at Billy's cubicle, whose ""work station"" consists of a dra g board and several drawers. The PHONE is equipped with a VIDEO SCREEN. SPOT a small, struggling POTTED PLANT, and, pinned to the cubicle wall, Billy's DRAWING of the main street of Kingston Falls. On Billy's drawing board is an illustration of Clamp's projected Chinatown building -- _a l s monstrosity with insane pagoda touches. But Billy has tried to breathe some' 3 e into it, wit r T the street, kids flying dragon kites, etc. Marla looks over Billy's shoulder at the drawing."
billy,It's almost finished. I just have to make some --
marla,That courtyard looks cold. That'd be nicer with the trees.
billy,Are they going to plant trees 40 there?
billy,"But, Maria ----"
marla,Elms.
billy,"Right. He's about to sit down to work, when Daniel Clamp's lieutenant Forster and his clipboard-carrying ASSISTANT come down the row of cubicles, looking around."
marla,"Hi, Mister Forster. Forster nods at Marla, runs an eye over Billy's cubicle."
forster,"It looks like somebody hasn't( i employee manual...d ' 1 it, r As he speaks, Forster opens a therette folder and takes out a bar-code reading WAND attached to the folder by curly cable. He runs the wand over the bar-code on Billy's chest, and reads from an LCD display in the 0 folder."
billy,"Uh, what's --"
forster,"Unauthorized potted plant -- possible aphid infestation. As Forster's assistant jots on his clipboard, Billy puts the plant in a desk drawer, and Forster spots Billy's drawing on his partition."
forster,What ig this?
billy,My home town.
forster,"Mister Peltier, do you know how much the Clamp organization has spent to provide its employees with art by recognized artists at this facility?"
billy,Yes air. It was just a --
forster,"A little touch, yes. Maybe eyerybods here would like to do some little touches. Coffee mugs that say ""World's Greatest Lover."" The cute little hula doll they bought in Hawaii. The ""Snoopy"" comic that just says it JJ1. You'd like that, wouldn't qu, Mister Peltzer? d 1"
forster,Coming to work every day in a Jy_Q hundred million dollar flea marks XZZ He turns to move on. 0
assistant,"With a ""z,"" right? As the assistant follows Forster away, Billy puts his drawing of Kingston Falls in a pocket. Marla stews."
marla,"Billy, this is Just what I don't need right now. Do you realize we've got department review in three weeks? This is a nuclear meltdown disaster, I mean it."
billy,"Sorry, Marla."
kate,"The Clamp Centre is the most advanced ""smart building"" in America, with the latest, in security, communications, and climate control. If you'll follow me over here... Still talking, she takes them toward a STAIRCASE."
marge,".some people have written in to say that, if they're serving these dishes in a dark room, maybe for those romantic occasions, they notice a glow coming from some of the meat courses. Now, that's perfectly normal... REVEAL that this image is on a control-room monitor at the Clamp Cable studios. Billy, carrying a shopping bag, passes the control roomand turns down a narrow hallway."
grandpa fred,".tonight's movie is so scary -- the people who saw it when it came out in the theaters twelve years ago are just learning how to speak simple phrases and eat solid food again! That's right'. Talk about scary' It's a good thing your Grandpa Fred is here with you -- He waits for something he expected to hear, but it doesn't happen. He breaks character."
grandpa fa,"The moan. There's posed to be a moan, from t ck, and I say, ""Oh, Renfield, y a o u want some more flies, don't you,"" and I go back there and open the door --"
billy,"Hi, Fred. Hey, I was sorry to hear about your new time slot. I think they're making a big mistake."
grandpa fred,A mistake? Kid. it's a disaster. People that watch TV at three-thirty in the morning are not scared of the Wolfman. The only thing that scares those people is getting sober and finding work.
billy,Yeah. I brought you something.
grandpa fred,Watch it with that thing. Billy puts the bat on top of a cobwebbed TV SET that's part of Grandpa Fred's set.
billy,I thought it would look good over here.
grandpa fred,"Frankly, kid, this was not what I had in mind. I went Into broadcasting, I wanted to do news. Public affairs. Something meaningful."
billy,"Horror movies can be meaningful, Fred. You should run some of the classics -- Frankenstein, m a cula..."
grandpa fred,All the great horror movies are in black and white. Mister Clamp only likes color. I donky ven have a gimmick. No species effects. A puppet that c s out of a box -- whoopee.
grandpa fred,That's the moan?
grandpa fred,"Oh, Renfield, you want some --"
billy,"You should run some of the classics, Fred -- FFAnkenstein, Dracula ..."
grandpa fred,All the great horror movies are in black and white. Mister Clamp only likes color. That guy is str___._. ange.
billy,You've seen him?
grandpa fred,"Well, of in person, but -- just to this building. You know wha V t nd f tenants they have here? There' esearch laboratory upat t2 -- tenet,] c research. Foolin d with animals, cutting thl .last"
billy,Well -- I wanted to get away from Kingston Falls. I guess I did.
grandpa fred,"You. got that right, kid. Have you heard these voices they have here now? Don't look at me like that. You know that white noise they play all the time? The static?"
billy,Yeah. That's so they can put people close together and they won't overhear each other. You're not supposed to notice it.
grandpa fred,Sure. But if you listen to it -- there are little voices in there.
grand fred,"That's what th Id's coming to, kid. You can't talk to yourself without ebody interrupting."
forster,Let me hear the voices. The technician brings up VOICES on a speaker. They sound like voice-overs on slick TV commercials.
announcers' voices,"(dynamic many .I'm an honest kind of guy -- and not stealing office supplies works for me, and e way I live today..."
forster,That's fine --
a technician,"to Forster) It's for you, sir. Forster turns to see a technician pointing at a MONITOR showing CLAMP'S FACE. Forster greets the screen."
forster,"Yes, Mister Clamp."
forster,"That's terrific, sir."
forster,Yes sir. Tall!
forster,"I'll -- But a Camp LOGO ;ills the monitor screen, and Clamp's face disappe rs behipo- it. Forster turns and looks over a technician's shoulder at a MONITOR. A spy CAMERA shows a stressed-out EMPLOYEE lighting a cigarette in a STOREROOM."
technician," There's not much air in the building, sir."
forster,"At four o'clock, people go into a slump. Then we give them oxygen,"
technician,Yes air.
messenger,"Yeah, got a delivery here.. He follows her back to"
messenger,"What kind of stuff do they do-ft there, anyway?"
peggy,We're not supposed to talk about it.
messenger,Huh. This is for Doctor Catheter.
peggy,I can sign for it.
messenger,"Okay. This copy's yours. Thanks. Whistling Gizmo's tune again, the messenger leaves the office -- almost running into DR. CATHETER, Splice-o-Life's chief scientist, who's on his way in."
peggy,"Doctor Catheter, this just came for you."
peggy,"I think the flu is on b;Eo -order. She takes out a Kleenex, blows he(;Z>nose again. Dr. Catheter holds his hand out. Q"
wally,"Are they? Dr. Catheter turns to a table where several different potted vegetable PLANTS are att ed to collecting tubes that feed into a central glass VIAL. DR. CAfTER How are we doing on a vegetable medley plant, Wally talked to the Bird's-Eye peopl ain. They're very excited . Wally nods, sighing -- the long-sgff ring researcher."
wally,"We came close yesterday, Doctor. But it rejected the pimento."
wally,"I'm very pleased about this bat project, though... He leads Catheter toward a group of ANIMAL CAGES,"
wally,"Oh, uh -- that's fferent bat, Doctor. South Amen."
scientist,"0 Wally, could you let me have some growth hormone? I'm a little short. FOLLOW Catheter to another side of the lab, where two more SCIENTISTS are at work. One of them  has his back to us at the moment."
lewis,"Hi, Doctor."
martin,"R R e l_ well, Doctor. The twins talk in rapid e nation, as if they share a brain. LEWIS t A Say, Doctor, look at"
martin,".I think you'll find it interesting. Following the SOUND of the crooning that caught the messenger's attention, they take Catheter over to a lab table where the LIGHTS ARE LOWERED above a covered cage. Martin pulls back the cloth to reveal GIZMO, who stops singing and looks up at them."
lewis,"Some sort of rodent, apparently..."
martin,.and it can't take bright light.
lewis,"Watch this, Doctor. He opens the side door of Gizmo's cage and turns on a TAPE PLAYER. Hearing the bouncy ROCK MUSIC, Gizmo playfully DANCES out of the cage as the scientists talk."
martin,That may be genetic...
lewis,".we're not sure yet. But as he amuses his captors, Gizmo is slyly looking around for a way out of here. He edges farther away from the cage..."
martin,"Sorry, sir"
martin,.tissue culture hursday.
billy,Hell. The WORKER in the next cubicle speaks up.
cubicle neighbor,Jump around.
billy,What?
cubicle neighbor,"You sat still for too long. The building thinks you left. It's saving energy. Jump around. Billy jumps around, and the LIGHTS come back on, as the messenger who visited the genetics lab comes to the Cubicle Neighbor's desk with a package."
messenger,Package for you.
cubicle neighbor,"Oh. Thanks. But as the Cubicle Neighbor signs the(P erwork, the messenger whistles to himself -- Gizmo's song min, in that sad minor. For a moment, Billy doesn't regis t -- and then CAMERA catches the realization dawningQ s face, as he looks over the cubicle partition and asks ijr'lntly:"
billy,Where did you heaA-11; at?
messenger,Huh?
billy,That music. Where did you hear it?
messenger,"Oh, uh --"
billy,No. It's not by Sting. Think. Where did you --
messenger,"Oh, hey -- I know. I was up in that laboratory, you know, on eighteen, and somebody was, like, humming it --"
billy,Did you see who it was?
messenger,"Nuh-uh, it was in the back -- Billy takes off."
billy,How you doin'? I bear your copier's down.
martin,"This is the most interesting bio- electrical work I've ever been involved in. Here you go, boy... He FEEDS the rat some liquid from a VIAL with a LIGHTNING-BOLT insignia on its label."
lewis,"Think of it...millions of rats in New York, and everyone hates them..."
martin,"But if one of them could power a portable radio for a month... He throws the switch. The rat's eyes WIDEN, then calm down as the current goes off. Dr. Catheter touches the rat, and quickly pulls his hand back from the electric SHOCK."
lewis,Theodore! What are you doing out?
martin,"Alvin! Put down that DNA! As the scientists chase the monkeys, Billy hurries to Gizmo's cage. He opens the cage, and HIS EYES MEET GIZMO'S -- it's hard to say which of then is more excited. But the gala reunion will have to wait. Billy scoops Gizmo into his toolbox. He walks out of the lab, leaving the copier a mess."
billy,"Hey, guy...did you miss me? Gizmo does EYE MOVEMENTS -- shyly hedging, then admitting it."
forster,"You're wetting my shoes, Peltzer. Billy sees Forster, sees the shoes, grabs a paper towel and is about to drop to his knees."
billy,"I'm sorry, sir -- let me --"
forster,"Stand up, Peltzer. Come with me. Billy grabs the tool box and follows Forster out the door. As they go into the anteroom, Forster's clipboard-carrying ASSISTANT joins them. #"
forster,"Do you know what that eans, Peltzer?"
billy,"It means ""men's bathroom."""
forster,What is the man holding?
billy,In the bathroom?
forster,"On the sign, Peltzer."
billy,"Oh. A little briefcase, sir."
forster,"That's right. Because this -- is the executive washroom. I don't think you belong in there, do you Peltzer?"
billy,Oh. Well. My mistake --
billy," That's in there? Forster snaps the folder shut. Gizmo, restless, RATTLES the tool box."
forster,"What's in the box, Peltzer?"
billy,"Oh, uh -- art supplies.  I'm mixin ' nts. Well, I better get back t 1 here --"
forster,"Hm. I think our ""random"" drug search later on should be very interesting."
assistant," Got it, sir."
gizmo,(Muffled twitter of acquiescence.
e billy,"We'll go home soon, and --"
marla,"Mister Clamp -- sir, I'm Marla Bloodstone, I'm the department head here, if there's anything I can --"
clamp,"That's okay. Everybody just relax, and go back to what you'd be doing normally. I know I haven't been down here before, but that's going to change. I'm going to be a little more ""hands-on"" with these operations from now on... As he speaks, Clamp glances over Billy's shoulder, and spots the Chinatown drawing."
billy,This?
clamp,You've captured the whole essence of the project here. Look at the kids with the kites. That's warmth. I like warmth. What's your name?
billy,"Peltzer. Billy -- Bill Peltzer. Marla watches, saucer-eyed, as Clamp shakes hands with Billy."
clamp,"That's what we need here. People who produce.  Let's lose these elm trees, though. People think ""elm,"" they think ""Dutch,"" ""disease"" -- Gizmo's drawer rattles open. Billy snaps it shut."
billy,"Oh, it's, uh -- it's automatic. It opens up now and then, in case you need anything."
clamp,"Huh. I didn't know about that one. He moves on, nodding vaguely at Marla -- who goes over to Billy, looking at him through completely new eyes."
marla,"Did you hear that? ""People who produce. I've been working here six years, and I've never even seen him in person."
billy,Well -- he likes the drawing
marla,"This is big, Billy. T i.s career opportunity,q4 cement window.For both          It is?"
marla,Clearly. We can talk about it at dinner.
billy,"Oh. That soundsgreat. I could do it, let's see..."
marla,Tonight.
billy,"No, I can't tonight. I've got -- an appointment."
marla,"I've got something tonight too, Billy. A brochure for the Clamp Cable Archery Channel. It's a total suicide trauma red alert deadline situation. And you know what? I'm letting it go to have dinner with you."
e billy,I just don't think I can --
marla,"What ,g with that drawer, Billy? I know every feature in this building. We don't have anything that opens itself."
billy,"Oh -- I knocked against it with my leg, I was --"
marla,"Billy, are you keeping some kind of ppI in there? It's a good thing Mister Clamp likes you so much, because --"
billy,"A pet? No, no, I'm alle $,; MARLA ,\ \ l Let.me see. Come"
billy,"You know -- I think if we leave right now, I could go to dinner. Just a quick one --"
marla,Great. There's this very chic new restaurant. It's Canadian. They clean the fish right at your table.
billy,Sounds terrific.
marla,"Let me just grab my coat, and I'll be right back. As Marla goes O.S., Billy slips Gizmo's drawer open and talks into it."
billy,"Gizmo...I have to go now. Just wait here, okay? Just stay put for a few minutes and -- He hurriedly closes the drawer as Marla approaches."
marla,Ready?
billy,"Yeah. He grabs his sportcoat, and follows Maria toward the elevators. As they go, CAMERA HOLDS on Gizmo's drawer. It slowly shakes i open, and the curious Mogwai's eyes and ears come into view, i checking out the world of Billy's office. Gizmo ducks back out of sight ...but, a moment later, a CHAIN OF LARGE PAPER CLIPS is tossed down from the drawer, making a ladder to the floor. As Gizmo starts hoisting himself over the edge of the drawer,"
billy,Uh -- could you excuse me a second? I'll be right back. Sure. Billy heads for an alcove at the
kate,Hi! I'm almost ready --
billy,"Iii.. Listen, Xate --"
kate,What's wrong?
billy,"Nothing. Um, nothing's wrong, but I can't go out tonight. I have a --- meeting. With some people."
kate,"Oh, damn."
billy,"I know. I'm sorry. But it's good E for -- what we were talking about, you know? Letting people know I'm there and everything?"
kate,In the middle of the night?
billy,"Kate, I need you to do something for me. Gizmo's here."
kate,What?
billy,It's a long story -- I'll explain it later. He's up in my desk drawer. You have to take him home.
kate,"Take him ham? Billy, this is nuts. If those things start running around in New York --"
billy,"There won't be any ""thin ust remember the rules. H a ''.t take bright light -- a ec sunlight. It, 1 his. And you can't get wat him. And the most important thing -- never feed"
kate,Can't he Just -- go back where you found his?
billy,"No. I have to go to this -- meeting. Please -- I'll be home as soon as I can, A beat."
billy,"Great. Thanks. He gives her a quick kiss, and leaves the tour guides' office. Kate waits a moment, then looks out into the lobby... 44A INT. LOBBY - KATE'S POV 44A i .and sees Billy leaving the building with Marla."
gizmo,"Uh-oh. George and Lenny drop down to the carpet to join Mohawk, as Gizmo -- standing now -- backs away. There's a grated VENT opening low on the wall behind him. Lenny grabs Gizmo with a fast-moving paw, and Mohawk, moving in close, SPITS in Gizmo's eyes."
daffy,Wa-hogs !
forster,"Hah! Good boy! I knew we'd find something in this guy's desk -- -- but as they reach Billy's desk, they find Daffy's paint PAW PRINTS tracking crazily over every surface. The dog keeps going bananas, but it's not drugs he smells -- it's the dander of the recently departed Daffy."
guard,"Hard to say, sir. A possible"
forster,"He's bringing pets to work. I don't believe this guy-it's not just plants. He's got to have 1,_. e s t ock ."
marla,Did you always know you were going to be an artist?
marla,"I had crayons too, i y. And when I was four years old, I was using them to write dos to the other children. Even then, I knew. C_j"
billy,Hub. That's somethin
marla,Isn't this great? We' _Jinally getting to know each otdr. You can't do that in an office.
billy,"Well, in there, everything's business --"
marla,"Right. Now, let's talk strategy. You realize, this changes everything -- for you, me, the department..."
billy,What does?
marla,"Your relationship to Mister Clamp. Your access. I can see a future, Billy. I see more office space...embossed letterhead...I see us --  -- swallowing up the publicity department."
billy,Wow. I'm being open 4th Billy.- haven't talked abQu feelings with anyone.
billy,"See, I usually don't pay too much attention to office politics and stuff. I have so much work to do on the illustrations --"
marla,"You have talent, Billy, and that's wonderful. It's a God-given blessing situation. But even an artist has to have goals."
billy,"Definitely. It's like I was saying to Kate, I said, Honey, you know, for an artist -- Maria leans closer to Billy, her tone more intimate than before."
marla,"I can help you reach those goals, Billy. If we join forces..."
billy,"Oh, we should definitely join -- Billy FEELS something in his lap. He looks down. It is Marla's stockinged FOOT."
billy,"No, uh, thanks'. Everything's fine."
marla,"Oh, that's okay --"
billy,Good. Right. He escapes the r au rant.
kate,"Billy said to make sure and feed you before midnight... As she arranges chicken and mashed potatoes on a plate, Daffy spots a BLENDER next to him. He recoils from it -- then, with an evil grin, he shoves it off the counter while Kate's back is turned, BREAKING it. When she turns and looks, Daffy has an innocent loops"" expression on his face."
kate,"Oh, God-you have to be careful here, okay, Gizmo? We don't have the money to replac things. Daffy nods contritely. Ka ings him the food."
kate,It's in the kitchen. Billy -- She FOLLOWS him to the kitchen.
billy,Did you feed him?
kate,Yes --
billy,"Kate ...Kate, where did you find this guy?"
kate,"In your office -- near that drawer, where you said -- Billy, look out! Too late -- Daffy LOBS a single-serving PUDDING-PACK at Billy. It bursts on impact, staining his shirt."
billy," Where's Gizmo? The Mogwai SPITS, then wings Kate with a piece of Salisbury"
billy,We've got to get over here.
kate,Billy -- you said there weren't going to be those --
billy,There won't be. Not if they don't eat after midnight.
kate, What about -- him?
billy,"We'll have to take him with us. He snatches a Lean Cuisine box away and grabs Daffy, almost getting bitten in the process. Kate follows Billy as he takes the flailing Daffy into the living room and stuffs him into his leather daypack."
billy,"You ever want to get out of there, you better relax. Daffy settles down to a low rumble."
kate,About what?
billy,"When he came to take Gizmo back. I asked him how come he could understand what Gizmo was saying... said you just had to know how isten. But he said I wasn't re cW t. For the 0 responsibili d I'm not -- As they reach the door, the ?q x ZZER sounds."
kate,Who could it be this late?
kate,Mister Futterman! Mrs. Futterman...
billy,We thought you were coming tomorrow --
sheila,Thirty-two hours'. We're sorry to come here so late --
kate,"No, no, that's okay. Would you like some coffee, or --"
sheila,"No, don't you go to any trouble, hon."
sheila,"Murray, you remember what Doctor Kaplan said. We're going to stay nice and calm -- "
sheila,"It's okay, honey. I hear it too."
bil,"It's, uh -- plumbing here. It...makes n e sometimes. Sheila, looking at qty, spots something -- iE I LA Oh, Mur I think we interrupt these two."
billy,"Oh, uh...that's from -- my boss. I did some stuff that she liked. I mean some work -- He tries to catch Kate's eye, but she avoids his look."
sheila,"Oh. Well, that's okay, Billy --"
billy,"Really sorry ...we'll call you... He backs the Futtermans toward the door. AD LIB goodnights as Billy opens the door, forcing himself to look relaxed as the Futtermans go. He watches through the door for a beat, then closes it -- and finds Kate suspiciously eyeing his lipstick tattoo."
billy,"What -- this? It was just one of those business things. You know, like -- ""Great job."" You don't believe me?"
kate,I believe you.
billy,We better get going.
cu,"Yeah ...or, wait""rfre j't yep peanut butter cups all nui(/"
lenny,"Yum! .and sloppily chow down. Up above, Yogurt Jerk I turns to the machine, sees the two spigots flowing. She's about to turn them off, but a complaining CUSTOMER stops her."
customer 2,"Miss, I asked for Oreo cookies and Gummy Bears -- this stuff is, like -- hair."
customer 2,What is it? It's a t.!
customer 3,What's going on here? Did that woman say there are rats?
billy, What kind of thing was in the trail mix?
customer 1,"I don't know, a fa= thing. And it's supposed to be health food."
billy,"That's it. It's after midnight, and they've eaten. Now they'll make their cocoons...and if they get to water --"
kate,"It's along here... They come to a deep, square RECESS in the wall. Inside is massive MACHINERY -- pipes, pumps, meters -- surrounded by a"
billy,"Great. Maybe if we shut it off, they'll even close the place down... Billy goes to a corner of the chain-link cage and starts bending links back from the seam, trying to make a big enough opening to slip through."
supervisor,"Give me video. The technician types a command, and a video IMAGE of Billy attacking the cage appears on the screen."
guard,"Back off! Put your hds up. Billy backs off the cage and ss a GUARD coming toward him, flashlight and gun in hand. As he gets close, Daffy starts bouncing around in the daypaelr again. The guard trains his gun on the leather bag."
guard,"What's in the bag pal?,"
billy,Nothing.
guard,Oh yeah? Let's have a look.
billy,"You don't want to -- The guard ignores him, opens the zipper, and LOOKS DOWN into the bag."
guard,"Aagghhh! When the guard pulls his head up, Daffy is hanging onto the guard's NOSE by his teeth. The guard flails his head furiously around, until Daffy finally flies free --"
billy,"No! -- and as the Mogwai's departing FOOTSTEPS are heard, the guard angrily puts Billy up against the wall, starts handcuffing him."
billy,"Look, we have to shut this building down. That thing that bit you -- there are more of them, okay? And they're going to turn into -- these Monsters, and --"
guard,"Tell you what, pal -- you can tell the cops all about these monsters, I'm sure they'll be very interested... As he takes Billy away, CAMERA holds on a spot over their heads...goes into a GAP between the concrete wall and ceiling ...and finds three big COCOONS. Their slimy bodies gleam dully in the yellow lamplight. As we watch, the cocoons silently GROW and change, gathering strength..."
billy,"Listen, I'm not crazy. People are going to be in a lot of danger. They wreck things. They kill people. If they get out of here, they'll destroy the whole city...they'll destroy everything. Listen to me..."
billy,Thanks for getting  e out of there.
kate,It was easy -- I just gave them a next month's rent.
billy,"When we get there -- go to your job, like normal, okay? And just keep your eyes open. What time is it?"
kate,Six-thirty.
gizmo,"Bil - lee -- -- but a GREEN CLAW GRABS HIM FROM BEHIND, jerking him backward, off his feet."

billy, Fred. I know...
grandpa fred," Sure. You're young. You know everything. Billy and Kate arrive at the newsstand, where Billy grabs four souvenir FLASHLIGHTS in the shape of the building."
newsstand lady,Eighty-six thirty-eight with tax.
billy, Now much?
newsstand lady,Four times nineteen ninety-five --
billy,Put it on my bill.
marla,"Good morning, Billy. That was so aim, last night. We're going to have to do that again --"
billy,"Uh -- Marla, this is Kate, my --"
mar la,"Oops, I'd better get going. See you ui tairs, Billy."
billy,"Uh, Kate -- listen, think I better explain --"
kate,"Don't do any explaining right now, okay? I'm too mad. A guide calls Kate from the guide office."
guide,"Kate -- you're up, honey."
kate,Excuse me. I have to go to work now.
kate,"0 Billy -- if we all get through today alive, you're in h,g, trouble."
billy,Kate -- f 
shopper,"Excuse me...do you have any styles that aren't, urn, fringed? They hold up several pairs of pants. All of them are ""fringed"" from the knees down -- as if they'd been CLAWED to tatters. From the store's back room, we HEAR a whoop. It's familiar, but the VOICE has become deep, raspy, and such less innocent."
billy,"Mister Forster -- ? FORSTER Zs: Peltzer! What are you doing in this building? You got yourself arrested here last night, and you come back?  Get security up here. He's out. He starts to walk away, but Billy follows his."
billy,"Mister Forster, we have to evacuate the building. Right now."
forster,"Oh, we do? Why's that?"
billy,"There are ... creatures in the building. They start out as these small, furry animals, but then they eat, and they go into cocoons, and then they become small, green --"
forster,"This is drugs. It's got to be. You're on a groovy little trio, aren't you, Peltzer? Well, let me tell you something, Mister Flower Child --"
billy,Just listen to me --
technician,Wait a mo. this is good. They start out rr d then they have the cocoons... V
billy,First they eat --
technician 2,"Well, sure. you're going into a cocoon, you want to have a little something first."
kate,"Sir -- I'm sorry, but you have to keep up with the rest of the group..."
katsuji,Excellent! Thank you! Please give me some right profile as you continue speaking!

People are simply crazy about these..."
technician 2,A caraway seed.
technician 1,"Whatever, right, and then after twelve o'clock, it comes out -- now, he didn't eat that after midnight --"
billy,Look I didn't make the rules. There are --
forster,"""The rules."" I can't believe this."
technician 2,"Or what about if he's eating in an airplane, and they cross the time zone -- But the technician's theory is cut short, as -- -- TWO GREEN ARMS BURST OUT OF HIS CONSOLE, ripping aside control buttons and speaker grilles in a burst of SPARKS AND"
marge,"This is how we used to cook for big groups, before we had our microwave ovens and the other modern appliances. It would take days to plan the menu, and hours over a hot stove to do the cooking. But now, we can make this same tuna-noodle cheez-product chowder surprise in just a few minutes, and you can feed anything from a high school reunion to a complete chain gang with this kind of quantity."
cameraman,"Huh. Brownout or something. Marge HEARS a TAPPING noise from inside the soup pot. Confused, she lifts the lid -- and JUMPS BACK, as LENNY -- now a GREMLIN, but his dopey face still recognizable -- sits up in the soup pot, wearing a chef's hat, and SPLATTERS Marge with orange noodle-casserole GOO. He whips out a TURKEY EASTER, and SQUIRTS Marge with it."
marge,"Look out! -- and THE OVENS EXPLODE, showering the set with GLASS. As Marge and her cameraman escape the studio, the ovens catch FIRE. The flames lick up toward the ceiling -- -- and set off the SPRINKLERS. George and Lenny grin, standing tall to shower in the spray. As the water hits, BUBBLES appear on the Gremlins' backs. Close on the bubbles, CAMERA finds the tiny heads of GREMLIN OFFSPRING, getting ready to burst out. As the studio fills with the ominous SMOKE and COLORED LIGHT of Gremlin multiplication, Kate runs from the room."
technician 1,"Mister Forster, I show lighting brownouts in five locations."
technician 3,"I've got a climate control malfunction, floors fifteen and sixteen --"
forster,What the hell's going on?
technician 4,"Uh, air -- Forster goes over to Technician 4's station --"
technici,"No sir, I'm afraid s not -- A VIDEOPHONE RINGS near Technician 3; he grabs it."
technician 3,"No, he said he was going to Mister Clamp's office -- hey, do you know anything about --"
kate,Thank you.
kate,Thirty-eight. But the VOICE that croaks back isn't the usual elevator voice.
clamp,HAve you shredded my mail from this morning?
clamp,Good. Let's do some memos...
clamp,"You're not my secretary. The Gremlin responds by grabbing a SILEX POT of boiling-hot water from the nearby coffee station, and FLINGING the boiling water at Clamp -- -- who ducks it, as it SCALDS the paint on the wall behind him. Clamp makes a tentative move toward the Gremlin, who THROWS the empty Silex. It barely misses Clamp, and SMASHES against the wall. The Gremlin JUMPS at Clamp, who tries to bat it away from his face, like a kid panicked by a moth -- -- but his flailing knocks the Gremlin back, so that its foot is caught in the hopper of the secretary's SHREDDER. Hating to do it, using only his fingertips, Clamp PUSHES the struggling Gremlin down into the machine -- -- which SPRAYS him out of the bottom like a black, bloody, eyes-only memo of DEATU. As Clamp stands gasping de the machine, the door to the corridor opens, and Billlybu in. He sees the shredder, and 0 the tattered Gremlin remaips 4 j ng from it."
billy,Sir -- are you all right?
clamp,I think so..-.I hate using these machines myself.
billy,"Sir, I have to talk to you. There are a -- The door opens again, and a dishevelled Forster bursts in."
forster,"Mister Clamp, there's a situation in --  My God, what --"
billy," Sir, please listen to me. There are more of these things -- maybe lots more. We've got to get people out of the building -- and we've got to close the building up. We've got to do it before sundown."
clamp,Yeah? What happens at sundown?
billy,"These -- things can't stand sunlight. It'll kill them. But once it's night time, they can get out, into New York. If that happens --"

clamp,"That's a good question, Bill. How dQ you know about them?"
billy,"Well -- um, you know that genetics laboratory, down on --"
clamp,Of course. Those guys.  I warned you that could be a problem tenant. We could have had three shrinks and a plastic surgeon in that space. But no...

billy,"Sir, we have to make sure that none of these -- things get wet. If that happens --"
clamp,"I'll tell you what we have to do. We have to get a lid on this thing and keep it on. No cops, no media. We'll handle it.  Go down to systems control and get on top of this thing."
forster,"Me? Um, but there might be --"

grandpa fred,".tonight we've got a classic horror movie, from Grandpa Fred's special dungeon -- Fred is interrupted by a MOAN -- not the normal weak moan on the tape, but a genuinely scary GREMLIN moan. He turns around, and sees a grinning GREMLIN emerge from behind the prop tombstone. As Fred heads back there, two other GREMLINS join the first one, and the three of them watch him intently."
grandpa fred,"Uh.. .I don't... One of the Gremlins takes the reel of film from Fred, unreels a little from the loose end and holds it up. A second Gremlin looks at a frame -- mimes terrified shock, then CLUTCHES his chest and falls back onto the floor. The of e%.Gremlins LAUGH."
no,"Uh -- that ' s right, it ' s real ' scary -- The other two Gremlins put their f alongside Fred's and make scary snarls. They like it here"

Customer 4 reaches under the salad bar's sneeze-guard with the plastic tongs to pull a clump of lettuce from the bin -- and is horrified to discover that he is holding an ALL-VEGETABLE MUTANT GREMLIN by the ear. This horribly smiling thing has RADISHES for eyes, CORN-row hair, CAULIFLOWER ears, STRINGBEAN lips and - - as it opens its mouth -- a darting WAX-PEPPER TONGUE. As other customers recoil, horrified, Customer 4 tries to drop the Vege-Gremlin, but, baring its sharp ARTICHOKE TEETH, it reaches out with CARROT fingers to grab his shirt and pull his THROUGH the sneeze guard."
leonard maltin,"And now for our videocassette consumer watch -- He gingerly holds up a videocassette of the first Gr,gmlins movie as if it is a long-dead fish."

The glowing beast touches the mouthpiece... .DISAPPEARS inside...and shows up an instant later on the video-phone's SCREEN -- trapped, writhing in pain, as RECORDED VOICES bounce around it and issue from the phone's SPEAKER."
billy,He's in the phone system...on hold. That should take care of him for a while.
clamp,"Uh, Bill -- thanks."
billy,"Sure. Mister Clamp, we have to stop these things from leaving the building. If they get out, that's it for New York -- at least New York. Clamp nods gravely, and takes a VIDEOCASSETTE from a drawer."

billy,What is it?
clamp,The sign-off. The b sign-off
clamp,"It's beautiful, isn't it?"
billy,"Yes -- listen, sir, can you set the clocks in the building ahead three hours? All of them?"
clamp,"Bill, there's nothing we can't do in this building. Why?"
billy,"Sunlight kills these things. That's why they're still in here. But when it's sundown -- or when they think it is -- they'll all get together in one place, so they can go out. They'll all be in the lobby."

billy,"It's just an idea...you'll have to set it up. From outside the building, if you can get out there."
clamp,Yeah I've got my own entrance. You should get out too.
billy,There's some things I still have to take care of in here. Things and. .people.
clamp,This idea of yours --

clamp,"No, no --  That's a false alarm. We've just got some problems --"

grandpa fred,"-- who is able to talk, and he's going to talk with us now.  I think the main question people have is -- what is it you want? The Brain Gremlin answers in his usual cultured tones, sounding lucid."
brain gremlin,"Fred, what we want is, I think, what everyone wants, and what you and your viewers have -- civilization,"
fire chief,What's this thing for?
e clamp,"These things can only come out when it's dark. We've put all the clocks in the building ahead three hours. When they think it's sunset...and they see what a nice ""night"" it is outside... they'll all be in the lobby, getting ready to come out. When they do, we drop this backdrop ...and let the sunlight fry 'em."
fire chief, Where'd you find this thing?
clamp,It's from a musical I was backing on Broadway. The one about Stalin. It closed last week.
fire chief,"Oh, I saw that. Boy, that guy could d c e."
billy,"Yeah. Mr. Futterman, what are you doing here?"
illy,I was tr o find Kate.
marla,Thank God you're here...
kate,I could just leave you there. It seems to be good for your attitude.
marla,"Look -- about Billy. Nothing happened. Really. I asked him to go out to dinner with me, but it was just business. 40 Kate shakes her head, impatient."
kate,"It'll do. She reaches into her purse, and pulls out a Swiss Army KNIFE. But as she starts cutting Marla down, Marla SEES something else, and SCREAMS --"
billy,"0 That's Gizmo, Mister Fu tprtt He's on our side. Mr. Futterman gives Gizmo a hand down from the display case."

kate,I am now.
billy,"Well -- Gizmo got wet, and then the Mogwais ate after midnight, and then some of the Gremlins must have mutated, from the genetic material."

billy,And if these things get out of here now --
billy,How come?

billy,I know -- 0065
billy,"Just do it. Do it fast...Kate, get a box, and put Gizmo in it...keep him dry... Down in the lobby, the happy Gremlins keep moving toward the doors..."
billy,"Kate, there's a call on hold in Mister Clamp's office. Can you transfer it down here without going up there?"

reporter,What happened here?
marla,"Oh, it was a complete nightmare disaster. We had to stop work completely... .as Billy and Kate commisserate with Clamp."
billy,"I'm sorry about the building, sir."
clamp,I'm not.
kate mun,You're not?
clamp,"For one thing, we're insured for the damage. For another...maybe it wasn't for people anyway. It was a place for things. You make a place for things..."
billy,"Well, you kept the city safe."
clamp,"That's right. That's a good point. The sacrifice...you know, this could be good in my next book. I should be taking notes. You have any paper?"

clamp,"What is it? Rand indicates Gizmo, who's being held by Billy."
rand," May I demonstrate? Gizmo looks at Rand, and nods somberly, Stallone-style. Billy holds him up, and Rand SPRAYS the chemical over his body."
billy,"Dad -- o -- but the splash f ater hits Gizmo with no effect, and everyone -- includ i the stolid Mogwai -- relaxes."
