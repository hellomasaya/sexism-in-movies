Speaker,Dialogue
prologue," Stagnant black water ... Greasy. Pitch. Thick. Oily. Dense. Heavy... Lapping... Slow.... A desolate canal... Night.  Onto dark stones... rain-slicked... darkest slate-grey cobbles...  And on through streets... Narrow.        Grimy.     Sooty.   Rank... Deserted...  Pastal-disused Victorian broken-windowed, derelict buildings and wharf side warehouses with rotten oaky loading beams and rusted iron chains... Mossy, mildewed walls... Dripping fetid water from corroded dilapidated ancient ruined guttering...  Moving... Turning... Into a pinched, arched, alleyway -- If anything darker, blacker... Foreboding... Forsaken...  And if we listen -- If we strain our ears -- listen -- we can hear music -- faint. Ghostly. Haunting ... ""Take Me Back To Dear Ol' Blighty "" as if sung by a jolly girl in a long gone bar surrounded by drunken men...  We keep moving... The music growing... In the distance a faint glow.... Dirty-yellow, diffused, misty light... We move towards it... Towards the piss-coloured light...  We stop... In the middle of nowhere... Dark nowhere... and the music fades... Fades away... Vanished... Extreme silence... All we have is all we can see...  The gable end of an old house.... Limey-light bleeding weakly from a broken, filthy window... All is still -- suddenly it comes crashing down -- the end wall comes crashing down - a flurry of bricks and mortar... Crashing down... The tumble of masonry... And through clouds of brick-dust and rubble we see figures inside... Through a smokey powdered fog we can see a group of men in the downstairs room of the derelict house...  On the walls faded 40's wallpaper, peeling in parts to reveal older dim patterns... damp patches... A window crudely boarded up... A few unmatched armchairs in various states of disrepair -- a 60's black vinyl, a deco-patterned smoker, a 70's cream plastic, a brown wooden kitchen chair etc... The colours in the room are browns, greys, caramels, darks, muted...  In the middle of the room, standing on dusty, bare wooden floorboards, his fist clenched aggressively by his sides, is OLD MAN PEANUT, aged 80... Skinny... Wearing a dark three piece suit... Gold watch chain... Black Homburg... He is squaring up to us... Staring..."

omp," Two years later I was dead... I passed away in the small hours in a nursing `ome in Slough, with a drip in me arm, me gnashers in a mug by the bed and me boots most definitely on!... I'd done me hip in the spring and couldn't cope with meself no more at `ome, if you must know... I died in a `orrible fuckin' room they'd give me in the midst of a bunch of doddery, decrepit, dribbling old mongs!... Come the time, this dragon-witch-bitch of a nurse, arsked me if I wanted a fuckin' priest?! To make my peace!... I arsk you!!... I told `em where to get off!... Told `em all to fuck off out of it and leave me to meet my maker on my Jack Todd!... I lay on my pit like a scabby                        * baby and waited for it... waited for it... waited for it to come... and get me! It came alright... The Reaper came, alright... in the middle of the fucking night -- Like a burglar -- Like a worry... I opened my milky mince's and saw... saw Death... The ugly brute of it... It's black mouth... it's cocky eyes... `ungry like the wolf... for me!... My time was up!     I was wanted!... ""I'll break you"", it said... ""I'll fucking' break you!""... I stared at it... hissed at it... spat at it... I raised myself up from the stainy cot with my weak, bony arm... got myself in a proud position -- my spine ramrod straight... It was reaching for me... grabbing at me... laughing at me... ""FUCK YOU!"", I said... `FUUUCCKK YOOUU!!!!!"""
meredith,... Is he a liar or shouldn't I have been there?... What d'you reckon?... I know what I think!
archie," ...I've met someone... Her names `Azel!... I was a bit nervous at first... fear of the unknown I s'pose... well you get set in your ways, don't ya... anyway, I like `er... like `er a lot- `s a nice feelin' -- an' she says she likes me an'' all! -- So you never know -- watch this space!...
