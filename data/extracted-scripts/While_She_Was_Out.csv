5th draft,"December 20, 2006"
map grids," From the pages of a Thomas guide converge, overlap and re- configure across the screen. The endlessly ironic names of American suburbs parade before us, their violet territories marching forward like a bruise into dark green patches of forest and wilderness.  Closer in on one last map grid which fades into a transparency of itself overlaid across the actual location of the suburb. The name of this housing development is ""Pleasant Valley"". The transparency fades out to reveal:  1                                                                 1 EXT.   PLEASANT VALLEY BOULEVARD - EVENING  From a sign reading ""Pleasant Valley Dream Homes"", a picture postcard boulevard of mini mansions curves into infinity.  Each home is brand new. Each has the same size lawn, the same shrubs, the same satellite dish. Each has an indistinguishable car parked in the driveway.  All the homes have Christmas decorations, Christmas trees with baubles, lights and Christmas stars sitting proudly at the top. The doors have Christmas wreaths.  The sheen of a recent rainfall makes all the surfaces glimmer in the lights.  We halt outside one house.  2                                                                 2 EXT.   DELLAS'S HOUSE - EVENING  This home too seems perfect until we notice the Christmas star has fallen from the top of the tree and lies reflecting itself in a puddle on the wet lawn.  Suddenly we hear the sound of wings fluttering and see an owl among the branches of the Christmas tree. It rises from the tree then swoops down to the lawn where it sweeps a mouse from the grass. The owl then soars off, casting a magnified shadow of her wings across the house, and disappears with it's prey into the woods behind.  Curtains part at a downstairs window. The silhouette of a man appears bathed in the blue glow of a computer screen. He draws the curtains once again and disappears.  3                                                                 3 INT. DELLA'S HOUSE/ KENNETH'S MEDIA ROOM - EVENING  We sneak between curtain and window ledge into a home office fitted out with a flat screen TV and a computer.  Scene 3 Page 2"
kenneth,Yes!
della,"SHOOT, KENNETH! That's Tammi's favorite doll."
kenneth,You should just swear properly and get it over with. Do you think the kids don't know what you mean?
della,I'm going to the mall for wrapping paper.
kenneth,"What do you do all day, Della honey? Cause it sure isn't keeping house. This place is an eyesore. I'm mortgaged up to the eyeballs for this?"
della,Put the twins to bed by eight. Give them a chocolate cookie with their milk.
kenneth,"Jesus, Della. Della honey, I'm sorry."
tammi,Mommy can I get an American Girl for Christmas?
terri,"I want a raptor dinosaur, Mommy."
della,You better leave Santa a note. It's only three days until Christmas.
tammi,"Where are you going, Mommy?"
della,The Mall. One chocolate cookie each and then Daddy will read you a bedtime story.
tammi,Daddy's stories are lame. I want you to read us a story.
terri,"Yeah Mommy, the one about the pirates."
tammi,"No, the cowgirls. Diamond Lil and Slingshot Kitty."
della,Tomorrow night I'll read you the best bedtime story in the whole world. I promise.
della,Frick!
della,I'll get right on that Kenneth honey. AFTER you stop drinking.
della,Hello?
della,"Oh, hey."
della,Sure. How are you?
della,How'd you get my cell number?
della,And how'd that go? Did he give you an earful for disturbing his ninety ninth viewing of Lethal Weapon Four?
della,"Well, with the way you flaunt your double D boob job at the free fun PTA events that's hardly a surprise."
della,"Oh nothing, Mary."
della,"Well that wouldn't be hard. Mary, do you need something? Cause I gotta go."
della,"TOOL SCHOOL?, Ouch, Mary. Do It Yourself Mechanics is without a doubt the most interesting thing in my life right now.  I carry my beloved toolbox in the trunk at all times."
della,"Sorry, Mary, I'm skipping this week. Kenneth's parents are coming to stay for Christmas. You know how it is."
della,"You check with her, Mary."
della,You too.  Bah Humbug.
della,"Bye, Mary."
della,The Learning Academy. Spring Street.
della,Hi Meghan.     It's Della Myers.
della,Yes I knew.
della,Okay.
local ad,Pleasant Valley Dream Homes. The lowest crime rate in the US. Call 1- 800-SAFE.
della,Can you leave word for Mike. I'm going to miss tomorrow's Mechanic's class. It's just the one time.
della,I guess some people find it boring.
della,Yes you will...unless I run off and become an outlaw or something.
meghan,Merry Christmas
della,You too.
della,Where are you? Grand Central Station?
cassie,"Hold on, I'll take the phone outside."
della,FRICK!
della,I almost rear-ended a car. Cassie?
della,"Huh? One of those rubber balls, I think. I'm headed over there now. Ran out of Christmas wrapping paper. Would you believe it?"
della,Aw shoot. My cell battery's dying.
della,No....I'm just. I mean I'm. Oh nothing.
della,It can't be that bad?
della,A latte's fine. Let's meet at the fountain opposite Victoria's Secret.
della,My battery's going. I'm a block away. See you in five minutes.
della,"Okay, okay!"
mother,Watch where you're going!
della,Sorry!
della,Lucky son of a .....
angry driver,"If you think you're gonna steal my spot, think again, asshole!"
della,Hello?
della,Do you know where I can definitely find parking?
della,Yes!
della,GREAT!
della,"Thanks.  Della arrives at the fountain. A piddling jet of dirty water gurgles from the mouth of a bored mermaid and streams down into the shallow pool full of nickels and dimes. She scans the crowd but there's no sign of Cassie.  Della sits at the edge of the fountain. She checks her watch then checks out the people milling around in front of Victoria's Secret, where mannequins in skimpy festive underwear are propped seductively in the window displays.  Still no sign of Cassie. She's about to make a wish and throw a quarter into the fountain when a Red Cross worker shakes her ""Save the Children"" tin at her. Della sticks the quarter into the tin instead.  37                                                                 37 INT.   VICTORIA'S SECRET - EVENING  Della wanders the aisles of festive colored undies watching men pick out slinky lingerie for their partners and women examine slim fit underpants and padded bras.  She notices a pure silk black teddy, very classic, no frills. She lifts it from the rail and holds it against herself in front of the mirror, tries to imagine herself in it.  A young SALES ASSISTANT approaches."
della,No thanks. Not my size.
della,A latte please?
della,"Forget it, just the coffee."
della,"Della, two L's."
della,Lynn Monroe!
lynn,"I knew it was you, Della. I haven't seen you since college. You left to marry some handsome jock and we never heard from you again."
della,Something like that. Do you live around here now?
lynn,David and I just bought this divine house in Pleasant Valley. Do you know it? Great for the kids.
della,"Oh, we have two kids. Twins, Tammi and Terri."
lynn,"Why that's fantastic. Listen Della, it's been great talking to you but I have to go get my hair done! David and I are going out tomorrow night for a romantic dinner. I just bought this gorgeous teddy from Victoria's Secret."
della,"It's a pity they don't have any ""To a bastard at Christmas"" cards."
della,God planned it for Christmas Day just to tick me off.
della,Thanks.
della,How come the ladies' bathroom is out of order on a night like this?
cleaning lady,"The one at the other side of the mall is open, Ma'am."
carol singers,Silent Night. Holy Night. All is calm. All is bright.
della,Good Lord! What now?
della,What the hell are you playing at?
huey,"Trust the nigga, we not playin'."
della,What are you? The world's first homeless United Nations Boy Band?
huey,"Hell, yeah. We just wanna do shows and bone hoes."
tomas,And when yo done eating we gonna staple that bitch mouth closed.
chuckie,"Now, now, my little brothers."
huey,"It gitting cold, Chuckie. Game's not worth the dime."
della, Chuckie? At least your parents have a sense of humor.
chuckie,Parents? I ain't got no parents. I named myself.
della,"What? If you hadn't parked like an asshole, we wouldn't be arguing about it right now."
vinh,Whoah Lady!
tomas,"Keep right on talking that gang a shit, chinga. Yo crimes against the click are digging yo grave deep."
huey,We already in hell.
della,Not if these delinquents move their barge so I can back up.
chuckie,Nah. We not in the mood.
tomas,Say yo prayers old man.
chuckie,These Rent-a-Pig companies are too lame to give their foot soldiers any ammo. Liability laws and all that. Tough shit!
vinh,She's busting a move!
chuckie,"She ain't going nowhere. We got her Ford blocked in, right?"
huey,I don't know nothing.
tomas, Dar candela por el culo!
chuckie,"I can just put one through her windshield, right?"
della,Please God. Don't overcorrect.
tomas,Chinga tu madre. She making her getaway.
vinh,Chuckie!
huey,She on her cell right now calling the pigs.
chuckie,"You gone buck wild, nigga? We ain't going down for shit."
huey,You ain't earned the right to call me a nigga. And that goes for all you haters.
chuckie,Easy my G. Easy.
della,No!
della,Huh!
della,Damn!
tomas,"Hell, no."
huey,Shit!
huey,Our new sneakers are stuck up in the dirt like they was last years.
chuckie,Soon as we taken care o' Mrs. Podunk you and the Spanish dancer can hit the next mall. But first you fakers best haul this rider out of the filth.
vinh,Stupid ass car got nowhere else to go. There's nothing but trees up ahead.
tomas,"Screw the car, Chuckie. Case you forgot we got a witness on the loose! I ain't want to end up in the clink as some chimp's prison pillow."
chuckie,"Trust me dog, hoe's going down execution style before we see the other side o' them bars."
tomas,"Yo talk a real mob threat, Chuckie. But what if she gone already?"
chuckie,She ain't gone.
chuckie,Won't be long before we find her now. This baby could spot a needle in a haystack!
huey,"We caught up in this bitch's life like a soap opera. We could just bail, blast out of town like we was never here."
chuckie,This boy loves weed so much he tried to marry Juana.
huey,Ain't no one cares about the Rent-a- Pig. He just collateral damage to the peeps at the mall.
chuckie,Listen up skippy: SHE THE ONLY WITNESS.
huey,But if we hit the road now we'll be five hundred miles away before they find him....we could be drinking cold beer and swimmin' in the Atlantic....just like you promised.
chuckie,"We gotta take care of her. When she gone. The problem gone. Right? We'll head off then, Huey, just like I said."
huey,"We ain't   gonna make it, are we Chuckie?   I ain't never gonna see it. It's   over for that, isn't it Chuckie?   Just say it."
chuckie,GET REAL Huey! And shut the fuck up about the stupid ocean.
huey,"No Chuckie, you ain't."
huey,Someone call her mama tell her to lay out her black dress.
tomas,Is she dead already?
vinh,Musta gone been thrown through the windshield.
chuckie,She ain't dead. Look! Her footprints are all around.
della, NO! OH NO.
tomas,Where'd little red riding hood git to?
vinh,She ain't leaving any bread crumbs that's for sure.
huey,"When a nigga hungry, Imma wolf."
chuckie,Peek a boo!
huey,Yo left without yo goodbye kiss.
chuckie,You a window shopper little brother. You ain't never even done the old in and out before.
huey,Imma just a young playa tryin' to put my bid in.
tomas,"Don't worry, when we done wit you we send yo back in yo trunk to Mr. Podunk."
chuckie,"Back off five minutes, my Ghetto brother."
vinh,"Yeah, like how to quit mouthing if you wanna avoid drama."
chuckie,You must be wondering how we come to know your name.
huey,"Yo think she carrying the big notes, maybe some ice?"
chuckie,"Nah, it ain't about to rain diamonds, Huey. But maybe she cashed in her life savings. Planned to take off, start a new life."
tomas,You got enough scratch in there to grease us up with?
chuckie,Open it.
vinh,Open the box else we put you in trauma.
chuckie,OPEN IT!
della,Okay! I'll open it.
tomas,She ain't got nuthin'. Let's just take that pussy and git going.
vinh,"What the fuck, niggaz?"
chuckie,Shut up.
vinh,You hurt?
chuckie,SHUT THE FUCK UP.
tomas,Jesus hijo de maria el virgene.
vinh,What?
chuckie,My little brother.
tomas,Mamacita! Madre de Dios!
chuckie,You tread on my boy's face. YOU KILLED HIM.
tomas,I didn't kill him. I didn't kill no one.
chuckie,DELLA!
della," Shit! Oh Shit!  She trudges on, pushing between the branches, no clue where she is headed.  The further she treads, the quieter it becomes. So quiet she can hear her own footfalls and the sound of the trees breathing.  Then, she spots the light again, in the distance, shining out over the forest.  Thank God!  She trudges up a slope ahead, clinging onto branches and shrubs to help pull herself up.  100                                                              100 EXT. LEDGE - EVENING  The light grows closer. She climbs up onto a ledge.  A loud noise startles her. It's music. Rap music. Blasting.  Della pushes her way through to the edge of the trees. Sees....  101                                                              101 EXT.   CLEARING - EVENING  The woodland ahead slopes down into a clearing, where a huge ghetto blaster sits on a pile of felled trees. Young pines about to become Christmas trees. It's blasting out a hip hop anthem for a dead homie. A construction light illuminates the clearing.  A ghostly Vinh, head hung low, moves to the music, bottle of beer in hand.  Propped up against a tree stump sits the body of Huey, arms crossed over his torso, hood pulled up to cover his face.  The scene is so surreal that Della is drawn closer. She creeps along the edge of the trees.  As she moves, she kicks back on some dirt. It tumbles downhill into the gulch. She freezes.  But nobody notices.  She slips invisibly between the trees and watches as Tomas enters the clearing.  Scene 101Page 59"
chuckie,What the fuck you doing?
vinh,It's a tribute. A gesture.
chuckie,A what?
vinh,It's for Huey. Our dead homie.
chuckie,"You checked out, right?"
vinh,He loved that track.
chuckie,"Get a grip, skippy."
tomas,I didn't mean it. I didn't do it. I didn't mean to kill him.
chuckie,"Well he dead. That's it for him. OVER. But we still here. Hell, yeah. Payback's gonna be a real bitch for a real bitch."
vinh,She probably gone by now.
chuckie,"You best hope not, genius. She gone, we gone."
tomas,I can smell her Bulgari.
chuckie,She was right here. Must a saw your dumb ass tribute and everything.
tomas,"It Bulgari, dude. My Dad's bitch bathes in it."
chuckie,There more of her footprints.
chuckie,Zipperhead!
vinh,Kon'aro Kusotare.
chuckie,You know we don't speak the Chinky.
vinh,"What's your game, Chuckie? We left stumbling around in the dark while you hog the flashlight."
chuckie,I stole it. I get to use it. That's how it works. That right Tomas?
tomas,"Right on, dog."
vinh,What if I steal it from you?
chuckie,"There you go, bro."
tomas,"We gonna put yo ass on ice, bitch!"
chuckie,"THERE SHE IS, TOP OF THE GULCH!"
tomas,AHHHHHEEEEEEHHHHH!
vinh,AHHHHHHH!
chuckie,What?
vinh,I saw him.
chuckie,"Sure you did, bro."
tomas,CONEJO! AIN'T NUTHIN' CAN SAVE YO ASS NOW.
della,Awwwrgh!
tomas,Unnh! Unnh! Unnh!
chuckie,Tomas is one hard son of a bitch. He got her strung up from a tree by now and you know it.
vinh,There's something over here.
chuckie,"It's a big old tree trunk, you paranoid gook."
vinh,Tomas.....IYAH!
chuckie,It was a stupid ass accident killed Huey. You know that. And Tomas....
della,I'm sorry.
vinh,Aaaarrhh.
vinh,"I don't feel good, Chuckie. You think I got the hypothermia?"
chuckie,"Nah, yo got the yellow fever."
vinh,"I'm telling you, it ain't natural how she gets away every time."
chuckie,She got to be hiding up on the slope? You head up first and I'll follow with the flashlight.
vinh,I ain't going up there without the gun. End of story.
chuckie,"Never would've pegged you as a pussy, Vinh. Even when Huey and Tomas called it, I always defended your ass."
vinh,Ain't no one never said I was a pussy.
chuckie,"She a skinny ass bitch, too. Can't be weighing in at more than one twenty."
vinh,Tomas an Huey never called me a pussy.
chuckie,I ain't speaking ill o' the dead.
vinh,You already did.
chuckie,"Anyways, when you ever shot a gun? Probably miss and shoot yourself in the foot."
chuckie,That's the spirit gangsta. Holler if you see her and I'll shoot.
vinh,Faito!
chuckie,"There's only you and me, now."
chuckie,"After what went down tonight, we got a special bond."
della,I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.
chuckie,I figured that would help you find your voice!
della,Give me a break.
chuckie,"Monday night mechanics. Tuesday Pilates. Wednesday Spanish. Thursday, I wish...."
della,I want...
chuckie,Leave the tools.
della,I already did.
chuckie,"Hell of a night, huh?"
della,I was only going to the mall for some Christmas wrapping paper.
chuckie,Shit happens.
della,What now?
chuckie,I wanted to look you in the eye before I kill you.
della,That's what I figured.
chuckie,Huey?   Huey's ....
della,Oh my.
kenneth,Where the hell have you been?
della,Please don't call me that. Don't ever call me that again.
kenneth,What?
della,I just wanted to get home to my babies.
kenneth,What happened to you?
della,Are they okay?
kenneth,"Sound asleep, huh?"
della,Nothing.
