23.,CONTINUED:
bobby green,'S a good move.
marat buzhayev,"We need someone in charge here full- time, then. And we think you do a great job."
bobby green,"I appreciate that. You know, I been thinking `bout it--I'd like to become a partner here too--buy in with you.  I mean, I got a lot of ideas."
bobby green,"Well, I just think we could do more. Maybe expand into Sheepshead Bay. I know a good spot--we add a restaurant there, get the spill- over. Like what your brother did, in Miami."
eli mirichenko,"That's gonna take a lot of money, Papa. Your fur business can support that right now?"
marat buzhayev,"My son-in-law, he worries people take advantage of me."
bobby green,"I can understand that. But I got money to invest--we could make it something real special over there. Do what I did downstairs--you know, bring in name DJs on different nights?  What do you think?"
24.,CONTINUED: 
marat buzhayev,"Yes. Together we do it. You come to our Thanksgiving again, on Thursday?"
bobby green,"Yeah, sure.   I'll come."

louis falsetti,"My brother! How'd it go?  Ho, well! I'm guessing it went pretty good then!"
bobby green,"Listen--I get this done, I want you to be a host. In one of our spots."
louis falsetti,"That's my specialty. I'm whaddaya call, a people person!"
bobby green,"Well, just make sure you get your old co-workers from the Health Department to give us a pass on the kitchen."

louis falsetti,"Yeah, no problem--half of `em got rats as pets anyway."
bobby green,Where's Rosario?
louis falsetti,"She's a player, Bob. You know how it goes."
bobby green,"Look at him... I'll tell you, [when] this is my place, we'll kick his fuckin' ass right outta here--"
louis falsetti," Bob! You gotta watch your mouth! I mean, he don't scare me, but uh, but trust me, I know."
bobby green,"Yeah, you know a lot."
louis falsetti,"I do, I'm serious!  Last year, one of his guys was gonna flip? Jesus Christ, what I saw..."
louis falsetti,Nezhinski dragged him into the toilet. They stood him up against the wall and held him--
louis falsetti,"Worst thing I ever seen in my life, Bob.  Anyway, cops found his head in the middle of Brighton Avenue the next day--fuckin' dick was in his mouth."

bobby green,I had plans down there.
joseph grusinsky,"Yeah, well, I tried. What do you want from me, anyway? You know, you're standing there feeling sorry for yourself, but you wouldn't be in this shit if you didn't fuck around in the first place."
bobby green,"You got real balls saying that to me. I made something for myself, and you come in and fuck it up? Just `cause I'm not trying to be like you? And Pop--"

mustachioed cop,"Chief, the union sent a shrink over for you--"
burt grusinsky,"Nah, I don't want that crap."
mayor,"Chief Grusinsky, an attack on an officer is an attack on society. Whoever did this, in a clean neighborhood like that--they gotta be hunted down like animals."

bobby green,You guys blaming me for this? Is that it?
michael solo,"Listen, I ain't judging you--I called you `cause I thought you had a right to know. But we're gonna be going hard after Nezhinski--and maybe some other people you're close to. Like that girl you know--"

The spics--  `Scuse me--the P.R.s, they're goin' nuts for the money--picka picka picka picka--and the girls, they're screamin', and I'm keepin' everybody in line. I'm fuckin' bustin' heads, like Bruce Lee--I'm fuckin' bustin' heads--"
50.,CONTINUED:
bobby green,"Hercules, do me a favor--before you kill a waitress, go pay the check."
louis falsetti,"Arright. But I'll tell you Bobkes, nobody else could ever do for you what I did."

michael solo,That could take us forever!
burt grusinsky,Doesn't matter. It's our only play.

burt grusinsky,Bunch of college boys from Kansas. We protect our own here.
bobby green,"Pop, Nezhinski's been talkin' about a shipment he's got comin'. Maybe that's how you get to him."
michael solo,"How you know about that, Bobby?"
bobby green, They been wanting me to buy in for a while.
michael solo,"Well, maybe that's it, then. If we can get him--  To set something up, maybe one of our uncles could move in--"
56.,CONTINUED: 
jack shapiro, It'd have to be him--
burt grusinsky,"Forget it, both of you."
bobby green,"What do you mean, set something up?"
burt grusinsky,BOBBY--
michael solo,"You'd go set up a buy with `em, just like they've been asking you to. We follow you to the spot, bust `em a week later. That way, your name's clean, nobody knows you're involved--"
burt grusinsky,"That's too dangerous for him! We don't know how solid his cover is out there!  That girlfriend of yours, she knows about you, right? So can we just get back to the discussion please?"
bobby green,Pop?
burt grusinsky,What?
bobby green,You could trust her.
burt grusinsky,Good. I'm glad. But it's not happening. So forget it.
