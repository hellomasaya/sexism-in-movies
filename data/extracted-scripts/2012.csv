Speaker,Dialogue
second draft,"February 19th, 2008"
satnam,"8200 feet. Used to be an old copper mine, Professor, sir."
satnam,"Correct, sir. But that is not what worries me..."
satnam,"We don't know, Professor, sir."
adrian,I still can't believe that Wilson chose him of all people to run the White House.
adrian,Shame he's such a pompous ass.
adrian," Yes sir... No, sir."
anheuser,Which one is it?
adrian,"We were talking about what a great speech you gave tonight. Well done, sir."
anheuser,"It's Helmsley, right? I'll remember that."
adrian, Professor West?
adrian,"Sir, the President needs to know this."
anheuser,"Helmsley, how long have you been on the job as science advisor?"
adrian,Four months this week.
anheuser,I would   say that's enough time to learn that we   have rules here. You'll just have to   wait until the quarterly science   briefing.
adrian,"If this is about what I said last night, I am truly sorry, sir."
anheuser,So you didn't like my speech?
adrian,"Can you please have a look at this, sir? It's really important."
anheuser,Who wrote this?
adrian,"An Indian astrophysicist I graduated with from Harvard and Prof. West, the preeminent geologist in the US."
anheuser,Who else knows about it?
adrian,"No one, sir."
anheuser,"Let's keep it that way, Helmsley."
russian interpreter,Mr. Makarenko wishes to have his interpreters present.
president wilson,"Mr. President, judging from the conversations we've had in the past, I can assure you, your English is absolutely fine, for what I have to say."
lin,I will send you money mother.
colonel,Who can read and write?
saudi prince,You must understand I have a very big family. Mister...
saudi prince,"Mister Isaacs, one billion dollars is a lot of money."
manfred picard,"Laura, I'm putting a lot of trust in your people."
laura,"There are too many crazy people who could hurt her, Manfred. The World Heritage Foundation has done this all over the world."
manfred picard,And she'll be safe now? Tucked away in the Swiss Alps?
laura,Perfectly safe.
jackson,Oh no. Not again.
jackson,"They're kids, Kate, going on vacation. It's not a doctor's appointment... it's supposed to be fun. You remember that, right? Fun?"
jackson,"... I know it's mosquito season at Yellowstone, Kate. I'll pick some up on the way."
neighbor,"Merrill, we should move back to Wisconsin."
noah,"Jackson, what is this?"
jackson,"Don't call me Jackson, Noah, I'm your father."
kate,"So what, you're a chauffeur now? What happened to the temp work?"
jackson,This is better hours for me. Means I can still write.
kate,Of course.
gordon," Simone, how many times have I told you, we don't do Lipo on Fridays. It's too messy."
kate,Noah needs to read twenty pages from his book each day...
jackson,Still?
kate,"Jackson, they've been really looking forward to this you know. Don't let them down."
harry,So this time we'll hit the Japs.
tony,So what?
harry,"Well Tony, electronics are cheap there and... you could visit your boy Will."
tony,Afternoon ladies...
harry,Are you even listening to me?
tony,Yes unfortunately I am Harry.
harry,I heard from Audrey you're a grandpa now.
tony,Why don't you keep your nose out of my family. You're cramping my style.
harry,He married a Japanese girl - how is that the end of the world? You should at least go see him.
tony,Why? Do you see your boy?
harry,Not as much as I'd like. DC is a long way. But at least we talk.
tony,What about?
harry,"Life, how short it is..."
tony,What the hell was that?
laura,Manfred is that you?
manfred picard,I had my suspicions. I should have said something. They are following me.
manfred picard,They may be listening to us too. Laura the Heritage Foundation is a sham.
manfred,"The art you collected, it's not in the Alps."
radio host,"... After what is going on in La-La- land with all those surface cracks, I told myself: Get your stupid ass to Yellowstone. I don't want to miss all the great fun, when it finally blows..."
lilly,What happened to the music?
jackson,"Hang on, sweet pea, let daddy listen to this for a moment..."
radio host,"... There's been government people flying in and out all morning. And trust me, they did not look happy..."
laura,You have to see this.
president wilson,It's alright Sally.
cnn anchor,... Mr. Picard had been the director of the French National Museums for 24 years. As fate would have it his assassination took place in the same Paris tunnel where Princess Diana died
laura,"I just talked to him, Dad. He told me the world Heritage Foundation is a sham. Is that true?"
president wilson,"Honey, calm down."
laura,A man was killed! I want the truth Dad. Right now.
jackson,"To a very special place, Lil'bee. It's a lake. A place where mommy and daddy fell in love.  Remember the book I gave you?"
noah,"I don't want to know where you and mom had sex. I'm not ready for that, Jackson."
jackson,"I'm your dad, Noah."
jackson,This wasn't here before.
noah,Don't you see the signs?
jackson,It's fine guys.
jackson,It's gone. The whole darn lake is gone. I swear you guys there was a lake here.
jackson,"It's okay, Noh'."
adrian,"I'll be with you in a second, Professor."
officer,... And then you climbed over a posted fence? Just like that?
noah,I told you.
jackson,Isn't this supposed to be a National Park? There shouldn't be fences. What are you guys doing around here anyway?
jackson,"So, where did the lake go?"
adrian,"That's what we're trying to find out. We think this whole area has become potentially unstable. I would advise you to take your kids and leave, Mr..."
jackson," Yeah, that's me."
adrian,"What a coincidence. I'm reading your book, as we speak... first third, around day 300, when the shuttle loses communication with earth and drifts off into space."
jackson,You're one of lucky 422 who bought it.
adrian,Actually I didn't buy it. My father gave it to me.
jackson,"Oh, I see."
adrian,"Officer, can you return them to the campgrounds, please.  Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Curtis."
lilly,He was very nice.
jackson,"Yes he was, Lil'bee."
charlie frost,What did the government guys tell you?
jackson,They think it's not such a good idea to climb over their fences. They feel the area is unstable.
charlie frost,Unstable! Ha-ha! They say its unstable! That's funny...
noah,There are mosquitos in here. Did anybody spray the tent?
jackson,We'll get some of that tomorrow. For tonight just put your head under the blankie.
lilly,Daddy you said you weren't gonna work on your book.
jackson,"I'm not Honey, I promise. Are you wearing your pull-ups?"
noah,No... Gordon gave it to me for my birthday.
jackson,Noah. Things like a cell phone have to be discussed in the family.
noah, What family?
jackson,Go to sleep guys.
adrian,"... You have to immediately inform the President, Mr Anheuser. The readings look much worse than I expected. "
adrian,We were wrong! By five or six months...
charlie frost,"... This is Charlie Frost reporting live from Yellowstone National Park, soon to become the world's largest active volcano."
jackson,Hi. Mind if I join you?
charlie frost,I only got a few minutes.
jackson,I just heard part of your broadcast... Mind me asking a question? What exactly is it... that will start in Hollywood?
charlie frost, Actually it's gonna be the whole west coast...
jackson,What are you talking about?
charlie frost,"The apocalypse, the end of days. The Mayans knew it, the I Ching and the Bible, kind of..."
charlie's voice,"In the year 2012 a cataclysmic event will unfold. Caused by an alignment of the planets in our solar system that only happens every 640,000 years... Just imagine the earth as an Orange..."
charlie frost,... and Albert Einstein endorsed it...
jackson,"If they all knew, don't you think somebody would tell us?"
charlie frost,They can't. Just think about it. First the stockmarket would crash...
jackson,A seat?
charlie frost," They're building spaceships, man."
jackson,Oh... I see.
charlie frost,"No really... One of my listeners, a geography professor at UTSC, has even figured out where they're building them. He sent me a map."
jackson,"Well... Charlie, I think I gotta go. My kids are sleeping."
charlie frost,"Get them out of Yellowstone, man. It's gonna get ugly here."
jackson,"Night, Charlie."
charlie frost,"Sorry for the delay, folks. But even in times like these, a man has got to eat..."
gordon,Why don't we make a baby?
kate,Stop it! We're in public.
gordon,"Honey, I created them. And now suddenly I can't touch them?"
kate,Just because I don't care for your arrogant humor doesn't mean I'm acting strange. He is the father of my kids.
gordon,Maybe biologically. Can I remind you what that guy did? First you gave up med school to have Noah... Then you practically raise him and Lilly by yourself while he sat glued to a laptop writing that junk.
kate,Some of his stuff is actually... He's published Gordon.
gordon," Yeah, published! You know your mother was right. You've always been drawn to guys with lofty dreams and empty pockets. But not this time right, sweetheart?"
kate,Did you see that?
gordon,See what?
jackson,Just stop scratching. You'll get them infected.
cashier,Before or after?
jackson,What?
cashier,I'd get before and after.
lilly," Look! Mrs. Birnbaum, my teacher is on TV!"
noah,That's our supermarket.
jackson," Kids, we have to pack up and go find mommy."
anheuser,"Sir, you have to initiate the boarding process immediately."
president wilson,Is this even possible? What's our information from China?
anheuser,They estimate four of the ships will be ready for launch.
president wilson,Only four?
anheuser,"If it's alright with you sir, I'll brief the panel about the new development."
president wilson,I'd rather have Adrian do that. They trust him. I told him to be in on the meeting.
president wilson,"Ladies and Gentlemen, we all knew this day would come. But we never imagined it would come this soon."
adrian,I'll make this brief...
german chancellor,"How much time do we have, Mr. Helmsley?"
adrian,"Two, maybe three days if we're lucky."
anheuser,Apologies Prime minster. He's still new to the job.
president wilson,"Nevertheless, Mr. Antonioni, we have to make an immediate decision."
boxing announcer,... and tonight's challenger for the heavy weight world championship of the world. Here he is... Mister Zultan Balashin!
yuri,Zultan!
zultan," Ah, finally, Yuri. I thought I would not see you."
coach,"He needs to concentrate now, Mister Karpov."
yuri,"You shut up... when I talk to my boy, understand?"
coach,"Yes, Mr. Karpov."
yuri,Good... That is good.  Zultan my friend. Do not forget. We are fighters. We never go down. We always stay on our feet...
tamara,Yuri bear... where are you going?
jackson,"Lilly, we're home sweetie.  Wake up big man."
kate,"Oh honey, I'm so glad you're back... And you too, darling."
jackson,We tried calling but -
kate,At least it looks like the Mosquitos ate well.
yuri,Good. That is good. I'm sending the Gulfstream to pick up Alec and Oleg.
tamara," Tell him to bring Caesar's raincoat, it's in the Range Rover."
alec,"Curtis, you are late."
oleg,Careful with our stuff. Don't get it dirty.
preacher,"... There will be famines, pestilences and earthquakes, sayeth the Lord."
alec,"Curtis, can't you go faster?"
jackson,Are you guys blind? I can't run people over.
oleg,Why not? They're idiots anyway.
sasha,Hey Jackson. Took you a while...
alec,Ouch! Be more careful!
oleg,"Now you're laughing, Curtis. But we are going on a big ship.  We will live... and you will die."
jackson,Where can I rent a plane?
governor," ... just this morning my people at Caltech told me that in the last 36 hours we had basically zero earthquake activity in Southern California, which is very rare..."
jackson,"... Kate, we have to get out of LA! I've rented a plane for us. Get the kids ready! I'll be there in five."
kate,The kids have plans today...
jackson,Are you kidding me!
kate,No I'm not! Noah has music at 2 and Lil' has Karate.
gordon,Not that we'd expect him to remember.
jackson, California is going down! Pack up the kids!
kate,You're crazy! The Governor just said we're fine now.
jackson,"The Governor's a meathead, how would he know anything? Kate listen! You gotta trust me over some politician. Come on."
lilly,"Mommy, why are you so angry with Daddy?"
laura,"Because your daddy is a lunatic, darling."
governor,"... it looks to me, like the worst is over."
jackson,"We have to leave! Noah, let's go!"
kate,I think we're safer here!
jackson,"Noah, now! Kate please..."
gordon,I think he's right.
jackson,Get in the car!
noah,Holy shit!
jackson,Damn it! Where's the pilot?
kate,"Gordon, you know how to fly."
gordon,I... had a couple lessons...
jackson,Did you cover taking off?
gordon,Yeah.
jackson,That's good enough for me.
jackson,I'm coming.
gordon, But I'm supposed to check all these first...
noah,"Guys, behind us!"
everybody,Gordon! Damn it! Lift off!
gordon,I can't get it up!
noah," That was amazing, Gordon!"
jackson,Are you okay?
kate, I'm fine. How did you know this was gonna happen?
jackson,I didn't.  Do we have enough fuel to make it to Yellowstone?
waiter,You got fans Tony...
harry, I'll be right there.
adrian,"You remember when I told you about the dam in China? Well, it's happening much sooner than we anticipated."
harry,Hah... About time someone cleaned up that mess.
adrian,"Where are you, dad? What exactly is the course of the `Freedom' right now?..."
harry,"You know, your mom and I, we had a hell of a great life... and a hell of a great kid too.  And the `Freedom' is a pretty big ship you know... Don't write your old man off, just yet."
adrian,"I love you, dad."
harry,"Love you too, son."
harry,Hey Herb. Get me a double Jack on the rocks.
tony,After twenty-five years on the wagon?
harry,"Why not? Who cares how long we do certain things? How long we drink booze, how long we talk to people... Or how long we don't talk to people."
tony,"Woah!... Harry, what's the matter with you? Let's go. We're back on."
harry,"Call your kid, you stubborn old ass.  I'm not going back on that stage unless you promise to call him."
waiter," Tony, the ladies are waiting for you."
harry,"Promise me, Tony... please."
tony,"Yeah, maybe I should call him..."
news anchor,"... There is little we know at this point, but the earthquake registered at 10.1 on the Richter scale. The whole of the Western seaboard was hit..."
adrian, Have you seen this?
adrian,Any news from Yellowstone?
jackson,"Guys, there's fuel! Fill her up and I'll look for Charlie."
kate,You're sure about this?
jackson,"Kate, everything this guy said so far has happened. I'll be right back."
lilly,Daddy wait! I wanna come with you!
kate,Lilly! Come back!
jackson,It's fine! I'll take her.
charlie's voice,... I am standing here at the highest point on what is the rim of this super volcano...
jackson,"He's got to be close by, Lil'bee..."
lilly,"Let's go back, Daddy."
jackson,"Listen to me. We have to find Charlie. He's got a secret map, you know, like Jack Sparrow in `Pirates'."
charlie's voice,"... The last time this baby blew, was 640,000 years ago..."
jackson,"Dial Mommy's number, sweetheart."
kate,"Where are you, honey!?"
jackson,Tell her we'll be back in ten minutes.
lilly," We're looking for a secret map, mommy."
kate,"Let me speak to your daddy, darling."
lilly,Ouch!
charlie's voice,"... I tell you guys, any minute now... any minute the fireworks will start..."
lilly,He's not in the car. He's on a mountain waiting for fireworks.
jackson,"You're the best, darling. Give Daddy the phone...  Kate I am sorry, I can't talk..."
jackson,You wait here for me! You watch the ship while Captain Curtis talks to the pirate. Okay?
lilly, Okay...
charlie frost, ... I wish you guys at home could see this on TV...
jackson,"The spaceships Charlie, where are they?"
charlie frost,You can't make it there.
jackson,We have a plane. We can get you out of here too. Let's go Charlie!
charlie frost,You'll never make it out in time. Just stay and enjoy the big bang. That your kid?
jackson,Where is that god damn map!
charlie frost,"Easy, easy. Watch the mic... I don't know. Somewhere in my camper."
charlie's voice,... The ash cloud will travel everywhere. 
jackson,We're on our way.
kate,"Jackson, things are really looking bad here!"
charlie frost,"... it's beautiful, kids! Just beautiful!"
lilly, It's following us!
jackson,"Just don't look back, Lil'bee!"
charlie's voice,Majestic!... Oh yeah!
charlie's voice,Oh baby! It's coming!
charlie's voice,"`This is the end, my friend'..."
charlie frost,"... Folks, always remember, you heard it first from Charlie."
jackson,LILLY! DOWN!
lilly,Mommy!
jackson,Stay down darling.
noah,"Give me your hand, Lil'."
gordon,We have to take off!
noah,No!
lilly,Where's daddy?!
gordon,"Kate, I'm sorry but if we wait we'll all die!"
kate,Gordon! Wait!
lilly,It's daddy!
kate,Jackson! Here!
noah,Faster Dad. You can make it!
gordon,"Kate, grab him for god sake. We're almost out of runway."
jackson,Thanks for waiting guys.
kate,"So, now that you got your map, where are we going?"
jackson,We're gonna need a bigger plane.
adrian,"Just a few minutes ago Yellowstone erupted, sir. The ash cloud will reach Washington in roughly 7 hours. Maybe 6. We have strong easterly winds..."
anheuser,And the crustal displacement?
adrian,"No one knows, sir."
anheuser,Let's get the government airborne and... I mean now.
anheuser,"Where is the President, Sally?"
sally,He said he wanted to spend a few minutes alone. I think he's over at the chapel.
anheuser,"The whole North American continent is about to perish, and Wilson decides to go to church!"
adrian,He's praying sir. Which considering the circumstances is not a bad idea.
anheuser,Maybe. But right now I need the leader of the free world off his knees and on Air Force One. Wheels up 1900 hours. Can I leave that with you Helmsley?
sally,I really don't like that man.
adrian,Mr. President? We need to get you out of Washington immediately.
president wilson,Now matter how idealistic you are taking office. You lose your innocence behind that desk.  Laura was right. People have died because of the decisions I made.
adrian,That's not your fault sir.
president wilson,You sound like Anheuser.
adrian,A little.
president wilson,You know what she said to me that night we brought her to the hospital?  `Tommy... I think you should do a lottery. Every one should have a chance to go'. That's what Dorothy said to me. That's what we should have done.
adrian,"There would have been chaos, sir."
president wilson,"You know what I believe, Adrian. I believe nature should choose for itself, from itself."
adrian,But sir?
president wilson,Go. That's an order Helmsley.
gordon,I told you we should have gone to my parents' in the Rockies.
kate,Gordon's right. Look at this mess.
jackson,"You don't understand, it's our only chance."
gordon,This isn't one of your crazy stories now. How the hell are we gonna make it to China?
noah,"Gordon, without Jackson, we'd never have made it out of California."
voice," Attention! The US National Guard has informed us, that an extremely hazardous ash cloud is headed towards the city of Las Vegas."
fire man,Let's move people! Inside the terminal!
adrian,Where's Anheuser?
officer,"In the command center, sir."
adrian,The President is not coming. I couldn't convince him to.
anheuser,"So, the captain doesn't want to leave his sinking ship?  Well, Mr. Helmsley, we just learned that the Vice President's chopper crashed 80 miles north of Atlanta."
adrian,What about the Speaker of the House?
anheuser,In this chaos... I have no idea!
adrian,"But she's Commander In Chief now. Sir, I just think -"
anheuser,"I don't care what you think, Helmsley."
adrian,He wanted to stay with his people.
laura,We have to go back!
anheuser,There is a protocol for just this situation Ms. Wilson and I'm afraid we'll have to follow it to the letter.
rescue worker,"People, stay away from the windows!"
jackson,We can't get stuck here.
gordon," She's a patient, honey."
jackson, Nice work.
sasha,"I found us a plane, an Antonov. They were just about to take off, but the tower didn't let them."
yuri,Can you still fly that thing?
sasha,Sure... But I need a copilot.
lilly,Gordon is a pilot.
jackson,Let's go!
rescue worker,Hey! Stop! You can't go out there! Come back!
noah,"Wow, that is a big plane."
yuri, It's Russian.
sasha,"Guys, follow me!"
sasha, You'll find folding seats on each side of the cargo hold...
noah,Wow! Look at those!
yuri,We had VIP tickets for that.
sasha,You check the main bus for the hydraulics. I'll balance the tanks.
gordon,Uh... What?
sasha,"Work the radio and keep an eye on the fuel, okay?"
rescue worker,"Move back, people... down on the floor!"
gordon,We have to get going!
sasha," We're going, we're going."
gordon,We're not gonna make it!
sasha,Shut up! We will!
sasha,GOVNO! . Help me pull!
gordon,Was that the Eiffel Tower?
sasha,"Ladies and gentlemen, we are on our way to China."
neng,"But Lin is my brother. He is working inside the big tunnels, where the ships are made."
neng,"Mother, I got a message from Lin. He wants us to meet him in Cho Ming, at the west gate. He says he can get us on one of the ships he is working on."
neng,"The dam is a ship, Mother. The government lied to us. There will be a big flood."
neng,No mother! We must pack up right away.
neng's mother,We took a trip with the Laem Song ferry once. Your father was throwing up the whole way.
alec,Our dad had one on order. We were supposed to get it next year.
oleg,"But then he cancelled it again, because of the ships."
noah,"If I was rich, I'd get one of those."
oleg,We have one. How many cars does your family have?
noah,"My Mom's boyfriend has a Porsche, a"
alec,Our parents are divorced too.
noah,Nothing we can do about that.
tamara,"How did you meet Dr. Silberman? He's great, isn't he?"
kate,"I think for the same reasons you did. You know, after breast feeding two kids..."
tamara,We are not married. And we probably never will... But he paid for them.
kate,I bet he did.
lilly,What did the man pay for mommy?
kate,"Nothing, Lil'bee."
tamara,What's your situation?
kate,Way too complicated...
yuri,They seem to like each other.
jackson,I guess... So tell me Mr. Karpov - how much did you pay?
yuri,"One billion euro, per seat."
jackson,That's disgusting.
yuri,"You know Curtis, I wasn't always businessman. I am a boxer. Was my only playing when I was a boy, back in Murmansk. My coach...  ... his name also Yuri... He always said: `Someone wants to beat you... he has to kill you first'."
gordon,"Let's get this straight, Sasha. I'm not a pilot. I'm a plastic surgeon. I just took some lessons to overcome my fear of flying."
sasha,Why did you give up?
gordon,It didn't work.
sasha,There's 14 on each side. Some of them must still be there.
gordon,"Guys, you really oughta take a look at this."
yuri,What is that?
sasha,The State of Hawaii!
yuri,Not good. That is not good.
jackson,How much fuel do we have?
sasha,Not enough. We'll have to make a water landing somewhere in the South China Sea.
gordon,At least we won't need our landing gear.
yuri,What about it?
gordon,We lost it all... in Vegas.
adrian,Can I come in?
laura,I've got nothing to say to you.
adrian,But I do...
laura," I'm a big girl Adrian. I don't need protection. You used me. You guys had me gallivanting around the world, as part of your little cover-up."
adrian,But you were doing a good job.
laura,"Sure, if your name's Da Vinci or Picasso. But if you're some young talent in Podunk, Texas, sorry you're not famous enough. People like you and Anheuser and my father - you think you can play God."
adrian,You know what your father believed. That nature will choose itself from itself.
laura,"That's bullshit and you know it. It's the fittest, the richest and the strongest that survive."
adrian,That's not true.
laura,Zero. What's your point?
adrian,It's called `Farewell Atlantis' and it's a fantastic read. It's part of our legacy now.
adrian,What if I tried to sort some of this mess out? I need to know you can forgive me...
laura,"I need to know that too, Adrian."
adrian,One more thing. Your father told me you were the most precious thing to him in the whole world... You are to me too.
old lady,She can't find her mother.
president,Why don't you two girls make yourself comfy on that big couch? I'll see what I can do.
president wilson,"Sally, can you take care of them. I'll go check with the Red Cross..."
old lady,"No wonder the First Lady fell for him. I knew Miss Dorothy Jones long before the President, when she was still singing jazz down in Atlanta with Harry Helmsley."
sally,"I know, she was amazing."
president wilson,Who can help me with missing persons?
president wilson,Don't worry about it. You're doing a great job son...
communications officer,"We lost communication with the White House, sir."
anheuser,"That's affirmative, Mr. President. Until communication is restored, I am in command."
neng, Hold on back there!
jackson,Couldn't sleep huh? Me neither.
kate,Anything?
jackson,"Nothing, just static. Not even an emergency signal."
kate,I can't think about what's going on down there.
jackson,I couldn't have left you...
kate,Do you think people change?
jackson,By `people' are we talking about me?
kate,Do you think you've changed since we separated?
jackson,Well I certainly eat a lot more cereal now...
kate,"You know, you always had tunnel vision. You could always just block things out and write. You blocked all of us out Jackson."
jackson,Do you love him? Gordon...
kate,I love him enough.
communications officer,"... Cho Ming reports the first tremors,"
anheuser,"Any clue what to expect next, Professor?"
adrian,Do we have any news from the Japanese seaboard?
newscaster,... Tokyo seems to have taken the severity of the hit... Unconfirmed reports indicate that the entire island of Japan is below water...
tony,I called... But I never got through.
harry,I'm so sorry.
president wilson,I'm coming home Dorothy...
anheuser,At least some good news.
adrian,We expect enormous tsunamis to reach landfall in every continent. The Cho Ming area will be impacted in approximately six hours.
anheuser,"So Helmsley, what you're telling us here is that... the north pole is now somewhere in Wisconsin?"
adrian,"It's the south pole, sir."
sasha,Engine failure. GOVNO! Two of six are down. We must get ready.
jackson,Let's go wake up the kids.
jackson,What are you talking about? I don't hate Gordon.
noah,But you don't like him either.
jackson,I don't know him that well.
noah,But I know him. He's really nice. You should talk to him more often. You guys would get along really well.
jackson,"I'll give it a try, Noah. I promise."
kate,Is it time?
noah,What's wrong?
jackson,"Sasha told us, it could get a little bumpy... and wet."
jackson,Your daddy has to tell you something.
sasha,Don't ask me how that happened.
gordon,It's as if the whole earth shifted by 1500 miles...
jackson,No shit.  It's called 'Earth Crust Displacement'
sasha,We lost our last two engines.
yuri, Get up! Follow me!
tamara,"Yuri bear, what are we doing?"
yuri,We're taking the Bentley!
sasha,CHTO ZA... Gordon! We're still too fast!
yuri,SHUT UP EVERY ONE!
sasha,Your turn Gordon! Go! Make sure that they make it out of here before I touch down!
gordon,What about you?!
sasha,I'll be fine! I have to land this thing!
jackson,We're waiting for Sasha and Gordon.
noah,Tamara! Open the door!
tamara,Where's Sasha?
gordon,He said he'll be fine and we should get out of here before he touches down.
lilly,Daaadddy!
chinese commander,Welcome to the People's Republic of China.
jackson,"Thank you...  Say thank you, kids."
chinese commander,What color are your passes?
tamara,It's a joke... a mistake...  Right Yuri?
yuri,You think I did not know about you and Sasha? May god rest that poor bastard's soul.
gordon,What!... Did that just happen!?
chinese officer, Mr. Anheuser - you're in Chopper 1. Dr. Wilson the same.
captain michaels,I'm Captain Richard Michaels. I'm the skipper of the American boat sir. After you!
captain michaels,"My sincerest condolences Dr. Wilson, for your father..."
anheuser,I've been told of damages?
captain michaels,We haven't completed the assessment but it looks like we lost Number 4 when the crust shifted.
yuri,What do mean we can't board Number 4? I want to speak to your supervisor.
soldier,I am the supervisor! Now get in line with all the others while we make arrangements.
yuri,I want your name!
soldier," Can you read? Now get the hell back with the other green cards, or I'll have you detained."
jackson,Keep thinking warm thoughts sweetheart. You're doing great.
tamara,"I should have listened to you, Dr. Silberman. I actually liked the way I looked before that monster talked me into it."
gordon,Did you know he asked for a discount... and he paid in installments?
tamara,Cheap bastard.
gordon,"You're better off without him. What he said about you and Sasha, is it true?"
tamara,Now that he's gone I think he was worth a hundred times a man like Yuri.
jackson,You guys hear that?
jackson, Hey! Help! Wait for us!
laura,Captain Michaels? What happens to all those people?
anheuser,"Dr. Wilson, there's a protocol for all that. You just stick to your art. We'll handle the rest."
adrian,Satnam?  Where are you?
adrian,What?!
satnam,There's a tidal wave coming from the East! It's huge!
adrian,"Satnam, what happened?"
satnam,I have to go!
adrian,"Do we have the latest satellite images of Napam, India?"
science officer,"One moment, sir."
anheuser,"Helmsley, what's going on here?"
adrian,Looks like our model was wrong.
anheuser,What does this mean?
adrian,"The flooding will happen earlier. Bobby, can you plug in the new data please?"
adrian,This one is at least 1500    meters high!
anheuser,Talk to me Helmsley. What does this mean for us?
adrian,"Bobby, plug in the new data and adjust the count down?"
anheuser,Get me the other Heads of State.
lin, Who are they?
neng,"We found them by the side of the road, my brother."
lin,You must send them back.
neng,I am a follower of the great Lama Yak La. You know I cannot do that.
jackson,Come with daddy.
lin,Why should I do that?
jackson,For the same reason you sent for your parents.
kate,"I have no clue if you understand what I'm saying, but I ask you as a mother, please take my kids with you!"
lin,"My plan will not work for so many, mother."
kate,Thank you ma'am. Thank you so much.
yuri,They're leaving without us!
soldier,What did I tell you!
yuri, Look! Idiot! They are leaving you behind too!
lin, They launch! We run out of time!
computer voice,Countdown to departure. Launch in 17 minutes - 42 seconds.
laura,Where can I find Adrian Helmsley?
science officer,He's in the Technical Command Centre. Follow me.
lin," Faster, Neng! Help father! Mother, give me your hand."
jackson,Move Lil'bee!
tamara," Oh my god, that's Yuri!"
yuri,Let that stupid dog go!
lin, Okay. Now!
jackson,Tamara! Come on! Get in!
yuri," Down there! Oleg, you go first!"
oleg,"Daddy look, Tamara!"
tamara,Caesar darling!
jackson,Tamara! Get in!
tamara,Come to mommy!
lin,I need your help.
laura,What in god's name is happening Adrian?
adrian,Anheuser convinced them all to launch.
adrian,Anheuser! We have to stop this madness.
anheuser,What do you think you're doing?
adrian,I know exactly what I'm doing.  Turn it on!
german chancellor,"Can you please turn up the volume, Mr. Hoffmann?"
adrian,"... But to be human means to care for each other, and civilization means to work together to create a better life. If that's true there is nothing human and nothing civilized about what we're doing here. Ask yourselves ... Can we really stand by and let all those people out there die?"
anheuser,We'll miss you Helmsley but somehow we'll get by. Officer switch that off.
adrian,Don't do it!
anheuser,Have you lost your mind? Look at the countdown. We have less than five minutes left... And none of our ships have the resources to feed those people. If you save them today we all starve tomorrow.
adrian,"There is a young astrophysicist from India who is the reason we are all here, trying to give mankind a second chance. He's the one who discovered it all, the one who connected the dots. We all owe him our lives."
laura,"If my father were here, he would open the gates."
russian president,... China and Japan agree to open the gates.
german chancellor,"The United Kingdom, Spain, France and Germany, and I believe I can also speak for the Italian Prime Minister..."
adrian,"Captain Michaels, you heard them."
lilly,Phew... It stinks in here.
tamara,Sssh...Caesar.
lin,They're opening the gate! It will crush us!
jackson,Noah! Watch out!
kate,No!
noah,"Something happened, mom."
jackson,We have to stop it!
jackson,"You did it, man. You did it."
captain michaels,What's wrong with the gate?
officer,"I don't know. Maybe there's something jamming it, sir."
surveillance officer,"Sir, we have a breach in the zoological bay."
adrian,Can you zoom in?
captain michaels,We're loaded. We can close the gates sir.
anheuser,Do it!
yuri, Pull yourself up!
yuri,Oleg! Catch your brother!
deck officer,"Boys, you gotta move."
alec,We wait for our father! He's still down there!
deck officer,"There's no one down there.  Come on boys, come..."
anheuser,Why is the stern gate not closing?
captain michaels,"Something's wrong with the hydraulics, sir."
surveillance officer,They must have come through the hydraulic chamber. There...
laura,That guy is injured. Something must have gone wrong.
anheuser,"You're damn right something went wrong! Congratulations Helmsley, you may have just killed us all but as long as your conscience is clean..."
adrian,Let's get an emergency crew there right now. I'll meet them at the Hydraulic Chamber.
anheuser,"You think you're the main man now, just because your fucking the President's daughter?"
adrian,What are you all waiting for?
technical officer,"If we can't close the stern gate, then the engines won't start."
adrian,There's no way to override it?
technical officer,"No sir, it has to be done manually."
neng," Almost there, Lin..."
surveillance officer,Water has penetrated the stern!
laura,What now?
surveillance officer,The rear of the ship will start sealing itself up one compartment at a time.
adrian,Then how will we get to the hydraulic chamber?
surveillance officer,"If we don't hurry, we won't be able to."
kate,Tamara! Take Lilly and Noah.
lilly,Mummy!
tamara,Lilly run!
adrian,Is there any way to talk to them?
jackson,We have to move him higher.  Over there!
naval officer,"Moving at 34 knots, sir."
captain michaels,What is our position?
navigation officer,"Darjeeling valley, heading south east, sir."
captain michaels,You must be kidding!
kate,We need something to stop the bleeding or he'll die.
noah,"Mum, will this do?"
adrian, Mr. Curtis... I'm Adrian Helmsley. We met once before. Your daughter is with me.
kate,Lilly!
lilly,I'm alright Mom!
adrian,You're our only hope.
jackson,I'll go back. I'll try my best.
noah,I'll go with you.
jackson,You stay with Mommy.
anheuser,"Captain, what's happening?"
captain michaels,"What's happening?...  We're heading straight for the north face of Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser."
kate,Noah!
noah,"Mom, we did it!"
adrian,Captain Michaels - close the gate!
captain michaels,That's affirmative. Close the gate!
technical officer,"Ay, ay, Sir."
captain michaels,Engage starboard stabilizers!
officers,"One is engaged... two is engaged... number three is out, sir!"
kate,Noah! Where is he?
noah,He was just behind me...
jackson,"If you would ever consider to give me another chance... I promise, I'll always be there when you need me."
kate,Whatever you do... I will never let you go again.
adrian,"...   and all we can hear is the sound of our   own breathing that reminds us we are   still sharing our memories, hopes and   ideas."
laura,How many copies did you say that sold?
adrian,Less than 500.  It's what you might call a cult classic.
laura,It seems we have very different tastes Mr. Helmsley?
adrian, Well that's healthy Dr. Wilson. Something we could maybe explore... unless you have other pressing engagements.
laura,Actually my diary's pretty open.
lilly,Daddy? When can we go back home?
jackson,"There's nothing we can go back to Lil'bee. Whatever's out there, that's our home now. Don't be scared."
lilly,I'm not Daddy. No more pull-ups.
jackson, That's my big girl.
lilly,Of course you can. He's your doggie.
adrian,"You called for me, sir?"
captain michaels,"Prof. West has something to show you, Mr. Helmsley."
laura,What's that?
captain michaels,Our European colleagues have already set course for it.
adrian,This is Helmsley.
voice,"No, this is Helmsley."
captain michaels,We should have a visual of the `Freedom of the Seas' shortly.
adrian,Dad. We're coming to pick you guys up. How's Tony?
harry helmsley,"He's fine, son. We're all fine."
adrian,Pardon me?
anheuser,There was no white kid better than you. I'm terribly sorry I said that.
officer,Standing by Sir.
jackson,I thought you might want this.
noah,Do you think I'll still get a signal ... Dad?
adrian,I finally finished your book Jackson.
kate,Really? You may well be the first person who ever got to the end.
jackson,"Excuse me, I believe he's addressing the author. Well, what did you think?"
adrian,"I'd say... those astronauts of yours would be shitting themselves, if they knew all their relatives are now stuck in the South Pole."
