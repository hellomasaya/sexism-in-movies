marcus,I look the same.
kyle,You ever watch television?
marcus,Oh yeah. Was about all I ever had to look forward to in the joint.
star, What's a joint?
marcus, Prison. Spent half my life there.
kyle,I remember TV a little.   Cartoons. It was great.
marcus,She your sister?

marcus, So this is it? Your life?
20.,CONTINUED: 
kyle,"We're gonna find the Resistance, fight for John Connor against Skynet. You oughta join us, you're pretty cool."
marcus,You don't know me.
kyle,"You're strong, you can read... you didn't kill us. Good enough for me..."
marcus,Skynet runs the machines...?   So who's this John Connor?
kyle,He's... I don't know. The best. Everybody talks about him. He's the one who's gonna save us.
marcus,"Yeah, right. Him and Jesus."
kyle,Who's Jesus?
marcus,You're asking the wrong guy.
kyle, So why were you in prison?
marcus, I killed a cop.
kyle,Were cops like terminators?
marcus,"Well... Nah, some of `em were all right. "

star,There's a book inside with pictures.
marcus,"""Guaranteed lowest prices... open seven days..."""

24.,CONTINUED:

marcus,Stop the car.
28.,CONTINUED: 
radio voice,"Do not give in to despair. As bleak as things seem, I assure you, humanity will triumph."

star,Food!
marcus,What is this?
kyle, Who cares?
marcus,Spit it out!
star, It's good!

blair, The hot zone? No you're not.
marcus,I've got to get to my friends--
blair,What friends? 
37.,CONTINUED: 
marcus,Couple of kids. They were in that flying dumpster--
blair,"The Skynet transport? It was carrying people?  Christ, we almost shot it down. There've been rumors about a concentration camp, but..."
marcus,Hydrobots?
blair,"They can't see, but they have killer sonar. They'll attack anything that moves or makes a sound. Even if you get past them, you'd be dead before you covered a hundred yards. If the terminators don't get you, the fallout will-- heavy rads all the way to the Gulf coast, nothing can live there."
marcus,You're with the Resistance.
blair,"Lt. Blair Williams, I fly for what used to be the Air National Guard."
38.,CONTINUED: 
marcus,"I don't know... this has gotta be some kind of, like, dream or hallucination. Like what happens to people right before they die..."
blair,That snap you out of it?
blair,"So let me get this straight, Marcus. There you are on death row, they stick a needle in your arm... "
39.,"CONTINUED: BLAIR  Since this ain't the resurrection, there's only one possibility."
marcus,Let's hear it.
blair,"Whatever they pumped into your veins just knocked you out. This Angel Project you signed up for-- there was a lotta cryogenic stuff going on before the bombs fell, they musta froze your ass."
marcus,What the hell for?
blair,"Drug tests, medical experiments, organ harvesting, who knows? You said you had no family, no friends-- why let a body like yours go to waste?"
marcus,I've never seen trees like these.
blair,We're in a mutation zone. I saw a two-headed squirrel here once--
marcus,Freaky.
blair, Tasted like chicken.
40.,CONTINUED: 
marcus,What was that?
blair,I didn't hear anything--
marcus,They're surrounding us.
blair,They're smart. And they don't scare easy.
41.,CONTINUED: 
marcus,Dog eat dog world.
blair,Thanks.
marcus,Staf?   What's that mean? 
42.,CONTINUED:
blair,It's a resistance term.    Sit tight and fuck.
marcus,"I'm not gay. In prison, I thought about puss-- women all the time. But now... it's not working. Who knows, all those years on ice..."
blair,Maybe it's just gonna take some time. Before you're completely thawed out.
marcus,I dunno. They just... sorta reminded me of her.
blair,Who?
marcus,"There's a woman, the last woman I saw before... when I was under, the dead time-- she kept coming to me. I think she must've saved me."
blair,I can't compete with that.
43.,CONTINUED: 
kyle,We've landed.
44.,CONTINUED:
star,What's going to happen to us?
kyle,I don't know...
marcus,We're in somebody's garden.
blair,Christ... there's supposed to be barbed wire along the edge.
marcus,Over there.
45.,CONTINUED:
blair,"Whatever you do, don't move.  We're in the middle of the mine field."
barnes,Somebody feed those things!
morrison,"Start up the generator, Barnes."
lisa,We got company! 
46.,CONTINUED:
barnes,Blair? Good to see you.  What's the password?
blair,"Eat shit and die, Barnes!"
barnes,Close enough. Who's your friend?
blair,Could you get us outta here please?
barnes,"Kinda dumb-ass, wandering around in a mine field."
blair,You didn't maintain the perimeter! Where are your sentries?
barnes,It's too early for that military crap.
47.,CONTINUED:
blair,You goddamn idiot!
barnes,He was takin' bigger steps!
morrison,Son of a bitch is heavy.
jane,He stepped on a Claymore? This guy oughta be in a hundred pieces...
48.,CONTINUED:
blair,What are you doing?
jane,Does he have a prosthetic limb?
blair,I don't think so.
jane,This is not skin... oh Jesus-- oh God--
serena,"Why isn't he conscious? Something's wrong, he should be coming out of it by now..."
marcus,Boo!
jane,"Thermoplastic skin, some larger hydraulics, but mostly titanium microgears... This looks like some sort of aeration and hydration system, function unclear at this point. Valves and what looks like an access panel below the ribcage... "
50.,CONTINUED:
blair,Whatever he is-- he's on our side--
morrison,How can he be?
blair,He saved my life!
morrison,Winning your trust would aid his infiltration.
lisa,Regional doesn't know what to do. They're gonna patch us through to Command Los Angeles.
nancy,How could you bring this monster here?! This is our home! Our children--
blair,What do you want from me-- I didn't know!
51.,CONTINUED: 
kid,It's awake!
marcus,Get me the hell down from here!
barnes,Shut up!   I told you to shut up!
blair,"Leave him alone!  Marcus, I'm so sorry..."
barnes,It keeps talkin' at me. God this thing gives me the creeps.
marcus,Why are you doing this?    What is this place?
morrison,We're trying to--
nancy, Don't say anything!     It's probably uplinked to Skynet.
morrison,"Then it's already too late.  This used to be an ICBM silo, we're just trying to stay alive here. Your turn-- where'd you come from?"
52.,CONTINUED:
marcus,Corpus Christi. It's in Texas.     Or it was.
barnes, It sounds completely human... it really could pass.
jane,Didn't John Connor say they'd start building things like this?
morrison,"Not yet-- not for years.  So, you're programmed with false memories, a human history--"
marcus,What are you talking about?
morrison,"You can skip the act, we know what you are."
nancy,Why are you even speaking to it?!
barnes,"She's right, let's just waste the damn thing--"
nancy,It'll kill us all if we give it a CHANCE--
marcus,I'm a man!
53.,CONTINUED:  Do it!
lisa,Regional got through to CLA-- they want us to rig a video feed.  He wants to see him.
morrison,Who does?
lisa,John Connor.
marcus,"So this guy is what, like king of the world, or what's left of it? "
54.,CONTINUED:
morrison,"John Connor founded the Resistance. When the war began, no one even knew who the enemy was-- Connor taught us how to fight back. He saved humanity."
marcus,"Yeah, well, humanity's never done all that much for me. Why can't I see him?"
morrison,"Nobody sees him. Skynet can't be allowed to discover his location, even his appearance is kept secret."
connor's voice,--hello-- standing by--
lisa,"Sir, we can hear you, sir, working on a visual, sir..."
connor,Not what I expected...
55.,CONTINUED:
connor's voice,It does seem lifelike-- is the face able to mimic emotions--?
marcus,This shit is ridiculous. What the hell do you want from me?
connor, I-- I need to know what you are.
marcus,"So do I! I don't know what I am, what I'm doing here, I don't know shit-- maybe I never did, but-- I'm sick of it! Just blow my head off or let me go."
connor,"This isn't right. I can't be having a conversation with a terminator, Skynet isn't that sophisticated yet. Unless... were you sent here from the future?"
marcus, What?
connor,"Skynet's developing a time displacement field, we've decrypted recent data transmissions.  I know for a fact that soon machines will be travelling back decades. To try and stop us from winning this war before it begins..."
marcus,"You're out of your mind, aren't you?"
56.,CONTINUED: 
connor's voice,Jesus... I've seen enough. Stand by for further instructions.
kate,"He's not a cyborg-- no blood, no human tissue over the endoskeleton."
connor,"Besides, the first T-800s won't be"
kate,Where did they find him?
connor,I want him extracted.
57.,CONTINUED:
connor,"Get him to our best people for disassembly, find out what makes him tick. We need to get into that metal skull, crack his CPU at all costs."
kate,Because people trust you... you give them faith--
connor,"No. Because I knew I would be, I was told. I know when and where the major battles are going to take place. I know I'm going to send my own father back through time to save my mother-- even though I haven't met him yet. Christ, I even know the year I'm going to die..."
kate,JOHN--
connor,So how could I not know about this?!
58.,CONTINUED:
marcus,Feels like I been here before... what are you gonna do to me?
morrison,Nothing. Los Angeles is sending a chopper-- seems you're some kind of VIP.
kyle,We're stopping.
59.,CONTINUED:
star,I'm scared.
kyle," Whatever happens, we stick together."
60.,CONTINUED:
marcus,Hello? Anyone there?  I'm thirsty.
barnes, Want some motor oil?
marcus,I need water.
barnes,Bullshit.    Machines don't drink.
marcus,"Please, I'm--"
barnes,"Shut up, robot!"
blair,"How's it going, Barnes? Thought you might like a late-night snack."
61.,CONTINUED:
barnes,Where in hell'd you get these?
blair,We got a stash back at the base.
barnes,Kinda stale.
blair,You need something to wash it down.
barnes,"I'm on duty, you know."
blair,"You know I always liked you, Barnes.   I just didn't want to join the harem."
barnes,What can I say? It's our duty to repopulate the planet.
blair,Noble of you to make the sacrifice.
barnes,C'mere.
blair,I prefer a little privacy. 
62.,CONTINUED: 
barnes,You're so twentieth century...
blair,Men.   You're all talk.
marcus,Why are you doing this?
blair,I don't believe you're a terminator.
marcus,So what am I...?
blair,"Whatever you are-- I owe you one. Once you're free, I'll lie down next to Barnes-- they'll assume you escaped while we were passed out--"
63.,CONTINUED: 
marcus,You think they'll buy that?
blair,"Worth a shot.  Marcus, Command wants to take you apart, cut open your head. One thing I know, you're alive-- and you've got a right to live."
blair,They're already here for you--
marcus,I'm heading across the river.
blair,No human being can survive there--
64.,CONTINUED:
marcus,"I'm not human, remember?"
blair,You're gonna try and save those kids.
marcus,It's the only thing I can think of that makes any sense...
blair,"Marcus, for all you know, they're dead already--"
marcus,"For all I know, they're the reason I'm back from the dead."
blair,"Damn it, we're too late--"
marcus,Where's that go?
blair,"Should lead out, but there's no way past the fan--"
blair,"Here. My ELT-- emergency locator transmitter. If you find the camp, activate it like this. It could really help the Resistance."
marcus,Thank you.

connor,I need to talk to the prisoner.
connor,"Lieutenant Williams. I'm sorry about the way you've been treated, but we're forced to take every precaution. I'm John Connor."
blair,Sir.
connor,"At ease.   Please, sit."
73.,CONTINUED:
blair,Sir-- he isn't a terminator.     He's human.
connor,"We know he's crossed into Skynet territory, why would he do that if he isn't--"
blair,He's trying to find his friends.
connor,What friends?
blair,"A couple of kids. They were taken in a Skynet transport, probably to some kind of prison camp-- he said their names were Star and Kyle."
connor,Kyle.
blair,Mm... Kyle something.    With an `R.'
connor,Reese.
blair,That's it.     How did you...?
74.,CONTINUED: 
kate,"What is it, John?"
connor,I always knew I'd have to find him someday. I just didn't know how.

connor,My father.

jeremy,Are you all right?
marcus,What the hell is this?
jeremy,You look like you've been hit by a truck--
marcus,"Among other things. Look, I'm trying to find some friends-- a couple of kids. They were taken here, I saw some buildings--"
jeremy,"The facility, sure.   Hop in, I'll take you there."
marcus,Marcus.
78.,CONTINUED: 
jeremy,"I can't connect with you at all... your interface must've been damaged. Don't worry, soon they'll have you as good as new."
marcus,I didn't think there was-- anything like this left... anywhere.
jeremy,Yes.   We're very lucky.   Want some?
marcus,This isn't food.
jeremy,"Well, of course not. Seems you got a little memory loss going on."
79.,CONTINUED:
marcus,Terminators!
jeremy,We don't call them that here.
marcus,What are you?
jeremy,A hybrid.    The same as you.
80.,CONTINUED: 
marcus,A hybrid-- human and machine?
jeremy,Of course. That's what this community is for-- people like us.
marcus,Jesus... why?
jeremy,You should be grateful to have been chosen.
marcus,What about the ones who weren't?
jeremy,You mean like Janet and the kids.
marcus,Your family. You lost them?
jeremy,"`Cause I feel good. The interface recognizes negative emotions-- rage, grief, despair-- and stimulates positive endorphins in response. Thank God, life would be pretty unbearable otherwise, don't you think?"
81.,CONTINUED:
marcus,Tell me everything.   How did you people get here?
jeremy,Most of us worked at NASA or DARPA. I was an engineer on Project Angel--
marcus,Angel-- what is it?
jeremy,"Advanced Nexus of Genetic and Electronic Life-forms... A-N-G-E-L. You can stop choking me, it's not like I need to breathe."
marcus,English!
jeremy," The goal was a superior support system for the human brain-- to go anywhere, do anything-- explore deep space, the bottom of the sea. I specialized in optics."

serena,There was no choice-- the old civilization had to be eliminated. To make way for a new world... a world without death or suffering.
85.,CONTINUED:
aide,"Sir, I'm sorry to disturb you, but you said you wanted to know immediately--"
connor,What is it?
aide,We found our terminator.
naval officer,There can't be any prisoners there. The whole area's a nuclear wasteland-- only machines can survive the radiation levels for any length of time.
connor,"Mobilize a combined air and naval assault, all available resources. We're sending in a rescue team ASAP."
kate,"All to find one teenage boy...? John, you really think this can work? "
86.,CONTINUED:
connor,"I'm standing here, I exist-- so it must have worked. We will find him."
serena,"Calm down, Marcus.   It's all right."
marcus,"Like fuck it is. I'm sick of being your guinea pig, what are you doing to me now?! "
87.,CONTINUED:
serena,Repairing you.
marcus,You all work for Skynet!
serena,"Please. Skynet works for us. It's only a program-- a tool, a means to an end."
marcus,The end of the world.
serena,Its sole purpose is to protect humanity.
marcus,Into-- this? A brain in a box?
serena,Skynet had access to the entire defense web-- including Project Angel. It determined hybrids were the only path to salvation.
marcus,Destroying the human race in order to save it.
88.,CONTINUED: 
serena,"When the resistance attacked our installation, we were forced to self-destruct. We would have taken you with us, but we thought you were in a permanent coma..."
marcus,"No, stop... I don't want it! You're dead inside, all of you!"
serena,"We're immortal. No sane person would choose to live in pain, forever. Soon you'll understand."
89.,CONTINUED:
serena,"How are you feeling, Marcus?"
marcus,I'm not sure I know how to describe it.
serena,It's called happiness. You've been angry all your life. You don't know what it's like to feel... a part of something.
serena,Pure ecstasy... we can share in it together.
marcus,When I was a kid my grandmother would go on about heaven... it always sounded so boring.
serena,Were you bored just now?
90.,CONTINUED:
serena,"Nanotechnology, polymimetic metals... working with Skynet, we're making amazing breakthroughs, well beyond anything possible before Judgment Day."
serena,We've already freed ourselves from biological limits... soon we'll transcend the laws of physics.
91.,CONTINUED:
marcus,A time machine... Connor was right.
serena, The Resistance leader?   You know him?
marcus,...I've just heard him speak.
serena,"He's a dangerous man. Delusional. He thinks he's a savior, but all he's really fighting for is... death."
marcus,"In the world outside-- the survivors think Skynet is the enemy, out to destroy them. Why don't you tell them about all this?"
serena,"Not everyone can become like us, Marcus. We just don't have the resources to sustain more than a few thousand hybrids."
marcus,"Then why... Some people I knew were picked up, taken here..."
serena,A boy and a girl-- in the last day or two?
marcus,Yes... what is this place?
serena,Part of the neural net-- human minds linked directly with artificial intelligence. The processing power of the human brain is still beyond anything Skynet can manufacture.
marcus,That's them.
93.,CONTINUED:
serena,Good news. He'll soon be part of the network-- you'll be able to connect with him.
marcus,Of course.     I... I understand.
serena,I don't know-- I have to go.    Will you be all right?  Of course you will.

kate,Your dad-- he seems like a nice kid.
connor,"The last boatload is right behind me. Skynet's pouring in reinforcements, we can't hold this place. And the people in the houses, they won't leave--"

marcus,Why me?
kate,Who else? Only you know the enemy from the inside. You liberated a Skynet camp... you're a hero.
