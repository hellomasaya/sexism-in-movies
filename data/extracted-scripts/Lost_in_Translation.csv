charlotte,25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
bob,"Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia."

kelly,...My Dad was anorexic.
charlotte, Really?
kelly," He was on the American side at the Bay of Pigs, in Cuba, and he was taken prisoner, and they tortured them about their food the whole time."
benzo,Where?
kelly,"My dad fought on the American side at the Bay of Pigs. So, when he was a prisoner, they would tell them they had put poison in their food and they would make themselves throw up... and when he got back, he did better, but he still has food issues. He has to have really clean food. And really simple. He can't just go have, say, Chinese food."
john," Oh, that's too bad."
benzo, How crazy is this shit?
charlotte,"Yeah, it is."
kelly,"...Oh my god you have to try it, this power cleanse is amazing- it's lemon juice and grade B maple syrup and cayenne pepper for seven days. Just like a half a teaspoon of cayenne. The first few days you're a little scattered, but by day four - it's amazing... my eyes were so white..."
charlotte,"Hi again, how's it going?"
bob,Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
john,"No, what are you talking about."

charlotte,"Ok, bye."

john,Its bad for you.
charlotte,"Ok, I will... later."
john,A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
charlotte,"Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me."

charlotte,"Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?"
bob,Ok.
charlotte,See you later.
charlotte,You really are having a mid-life crisis.
bob," I know, it's stupid."
bob,A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
charlotte,No.
bob,"I read it, too."
charlotte,"Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown."
bob,"Hi, Charlie."
charlotte,"His real name's Hayashi, but someone started calling him Charlie because they thought he looked like Charlie Brown. They've all got American nicknames because its easier for me to remember... they were just out in L.A. last month doing a shoot with John... that guy's Mr.Valentine, he's the art director of their magazine, I don't even know his real name, or why I call him that."
charlie,This is Bambi.
charlotte,Hi.
bambi,How's california?
charlotte, Good.
bambi,Good... I like your swimming pool.
charlotte,"Thanks, you guys should come back sometime."
bambi,Yes.
bambi,Kawaii. 
charlotte,"What do you feel like singing, Bob?"
bob,No way.
charlotte,You bite your nails?
charlotte,I could cut the ones that are left for you.
bob,Ok.
hans,I'm Hans.
charlotte,Hans?  Nice to meet you.
charlie,Make sure she gets home okay?
bob,I will.
bob,Are you ok?
charlotte,I don't want to go home.
bob,I know. I don't either.
bob,Lydia?
bob,"Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it."
bob,"He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was..."
bob,"Yeah, its really different here."
bob,It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
bob,"I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning ."
bob, Hello?
bob,"Charlotte, who?"
charlotte,Do you want to have some breakfast?
charlotte,"OK, see you downstairs."
charlotte," Hey look, it's Sausalito."
bob,I see them every morning.
bob,Hans was very attentive to you.
charlotte,I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
bob,"No, its easy."
charlotte,How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
bob,I don't know.
charlotte,Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
bob,But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
charlotte,Really?
bob,"Yeah, you don't remember?"
charlotte,Did I scowl at you?
bob,"No, you smiled."
charlotte,I don't remember.
bob,"I know, I kind of blend in here."
bob,"No, yes, it does..."
charlotte,Yeah? But look at you.
bob,"Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way..."
charlotte,"I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet..."
bob,You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
charlotte,"But, I'm mean."
bob,That's ok.
charlotte,"And marriage, does that get easier?"
bob,It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
charlotte,Did that help? Did you learn anything?
bob,We established that we have no communication.
charlotte,Oh.
bob,"We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything."
charlotte,That's too scary.
bob,When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
charlotte, No one ever tells you that...
bob,"But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you."
charlotte,"That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much."
bob,Where'd you grow up?
charlotte,"In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there."
bob,I know.
charlotte,John thinks I'm so snotty.
bob,You are.
charlotte,"I know, but that's what you like about me."
charlotte,"Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?"
bob,Because that would be too easy.
bob,Hello?
reception,"Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!"
bob,Ok.
reception,Do you want I send it to your room?
bob, Great.
reception,"Thank you, Mr. Harris."
bob,"Miss Kawasaki? It's Bob Harris... I'm not going to be able to do that interview today.., yeah... ok.... Yes, I'd love to stay to be on his talk show... sure.. ok... bye."
charlotte,You made it.
bob,They really have to work on that street name thing.
charlotte,What's that?
bob,It's for my daughter.
charlotte,How old is she?
bob,Four.
charlotte,"Oh, she'll love it."
bob,Nice one.
charlotte, Fuck off.
bob,What happened to your toe?
charlotte,"I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day..."
bob,That doesn't look good.
charlotte,It's bad isn't it?
bob,We should get you to the doctor.
charlotte,You think so?
bob,"Yeah, look at that thing."
bob,"How do you say ""hospital"" in Japanese?"
bob,Hospital?
bob,"Yes, can you tell me how to say ""hospital"" in Japanese?"
concierge,"""Hospital"" in Japanese? Hosupitari."
bob,Hosupitari?
bob,Hello?
bob,"Oh, hi, Elaine."
bob,Ok.
bob,"Yeah, I'll stay."
charlotte,Is that for me?
bob,Hello?
bob,"Hi, Lydia."
bob,"Uh, no."
bob,"Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost."
bob,That's not what I'm talking about.
bob,I don't know.
bob,I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
bob,"You know, eat healthier."
bob,Not all that pasta.
bob,Like Japanese food.
bob,"Oh, come on."
bob,"Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye."
charlotte,How long have you been here?
charlotte,"C'mon, let's go."
bob,Where's your husband?
charlotte, Working.
bob,Do you ever see him?
charlotte, Yeah.
bob,Do you know where we are?
charlotte,No.
charlotte,"Isn't it weird there are no street names in Tokyo... you'd think a city like this would have street names... you need a map to get anywhere... look, there are no signs..."
charlotte,"Um..Hi, John, if this is your phone? I'm not sure...I'm going to go to Kyoto for the day...I'11 try you when I get back. Hope it's going good... I love you, bye."
tv host, We hear you're quite a golfer.
bob, I enjoy the sport.
translator,They now have the competition for you with the Iron Chef.
charlotte,Rough night?
charlotte,"I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?"
bob,"Yes, but no, I can't right now."
charlotte,"Oh, I guess you're busy, huh."
bob,I don't want to be.

bob,It's ok.
bob,What?
bob,Yeah.
bob,That's ok.
bob,Tomorrow.
bob,Ok.
bob,Bye.
charlotte,You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
bob,"No, we'll find something around here."
charlotte,The Jazz singer? The red-head?
charlotte,"Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties."
bob,"You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?"
charlotte,I can't tell the difference?
bob,We'll have two of these.
bob,What do you want to drink?
charlotte,A coke.
bob,"So, where'd you go today."
charlotte,Around.
charlotte,"They're not going to play the whole album, are they?"
bob,I'm sorry.
charlotte,"That lunch was the worst, huh."
charlotte,When are you leaving?
bob,Tomorrow.
charlotte, I'm going to miss you.
bob,That's what you said the other night.
charlotte,"Well, I mean it more now."
new singer,"Good Evening. I'm Carl West, and we're thrilled to be joining you this week, here at the NY bar in Shinjuku."
singer,"Jt seems we stood and talked like this before,   we looked at  each other in  the same way thenr   but I cant remember where or when..."
bob,I don't want to go back tomorrow.
charlotte,"I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime."
bob,Why can't it last?
charlotte,"I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band."
charlotte,54?
reception,One moment.
reception,I will connect you.
bob,"Uh...Hi, Charlotte... it's me, Bob... ok, I guess you're not there... wanted to say good-bye..."
