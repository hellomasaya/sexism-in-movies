Speaker,Dialogue
fletch,Maybe tonight?
creasy,Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
fletch,That's what he said.
creasy, He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
fletch,I don't know how he doesn't know.He doesn't know.
creasy,Sonofabitch.
fletch,Wonder who his supplier is.
creasy,I have no idea.
fletch,I wasn't asking.
creasy,"He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?"
fletch,"I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy."
creasy, I ought to get some sleep.
fletch,"Creasy, how old are you?"
creasy,Nineteen.
fletch, You're not taking real good care of yourself.
man,Excuse me.I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
fletch,What?
stanwyk,We can't talk about it here.
fletch,Why not?
stanwyk,Because we can't.
fletch,Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
stanwyk,I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
fletch,"I think you've got the wrong gal, fella."
stanwyk,"I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut."
fletch,Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
stanwyk," One thousand, just to listen.I don't see how you could turn that down Mr..."
fletch,Nugent. Ted Nugent.
stanwyk, Alan Stanwyk.
fletch,Charmed.
fletch,I always liked this part of town.
fletch,What a coincidence.
stanwyk,What?
fletch,I came this close...  ...to buying this place
fletch,Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
stanwyk,Who?
fletch,Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.
stanwyk,"What are you, doped up or something?"
fletch,"I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that."
stanwyk, Come inside.
stanwyk,Buenas dias.
maid,Buenas dias.
fletch,I commend you on your Spanish.
fletch,"Ahh, the library. Masculine but sensitive."
fletch,"Really, I love what you've done with the place. Must have cost you...hundreds."
stanwyk,"Here's my proposition, Mr. Fletcher."
fletch,I'm all ears.
stanwyk,I want you to murder me.
stanwyk,Here. On Thursday. I'd like you to shoot me dead.
stanwyk,"The reason I ask you to do me this service is that I am facing a long, painful, and most certain death. You see, I have bone cancer. I don't know if you know anything about bone cancer."
stanwyk,"It doesn't get any worse than that. Just eats you up, bit by bit."
fletch,"You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk."
stanwyk,"I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it."
fletch,Why don't you try suicide?
stanwyk,My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
fletch,So why pick me?
stanwyk,"You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks."
fletch,Maybe I'm just on vacation.
stanwyk,Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
fletch,Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
stanwyk,I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
stanwyk,Fifty thousand and a guarantee you won't get caught.
fletch,I'm still here.
stanwyk, These will be open.
fletch,Wouldn't they normally be locked?
stanwyk,"Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets."
fletch,I have the same problem with my help.
stanwyk," I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?"
fletch,"I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy."
stanwyk,In this drawer....
stanwyk,Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
fletch,"So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you."
stanwyk,Precisely. Are you a good shot?
fletch, What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
stanwyk,"Get me on the first shot, if you can."
fletch,I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
stanwyk,Do you have a passport?
fletch,"Sure, all drifters do."
stanwyk,"Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment."
fletch,Take it where?
stanwyk,LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
fletch,Where am I going?
fletch,They serve dinner on the flight?
stanwyk,"It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Fletcher."
fletch,"You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?"
stanwyk,"I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Fletcher."
fletch,You sure those doors will be open?
stanwyk,"Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else."
fletch,"The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying."
stanwyk,That's right.
fletch,You sure got the hard part.
stanwyk,"What do you say, Mr. Fletcher? You'll be doing me and my family a great service."
stanwyk,Will you kill me?
fletch,Sure.
reporter,"Whoa, check out the beach boy!"
second reporter,"Looking very good, Fletch."
fletch,"Thank you so much  Hey, Larry!"
larry,Yo!
fletch,Can I steal you for a minute?
larry,Only if you promise not to return me.
fletch,Deal.
larry," 'Magic' today, huh?"
fletch,Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
larry,Shoot.
fletch,"Don't say shoot, okay."
walker,Fletch. Fletch!
fletch,Did you hear something?
larry,Not me.
fletch,"Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away."
walker," Fletch, I take it by your presence here that the story is done. Tell me I'm right."
fletch,W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
larry,"No problem, boss."
walker,Fletch.
fletch,"Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?"
walker,"No, I want an answer, Is the story done?"
fletch,"Uh, almost."
walker,"'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer."
fletch," And a damn fine one, I might add."
fletch,Two....
walker,Irwin....
fletch,"Oh, I hate it when he calls me that."
walker,"Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!"
fletch,"I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?"
walker,No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
fletch,I never read the paper.
walker,...never reads the paper...
fletch,What's the spread on the game tonight?
walker,I don't know.  Look!
fletch,Looks great.
next week,"A ""JANE DOE"" SPECIAL REPORT: DRUGS ON OUR BEACHES - SHAME OF THE CITY"
fletch,'Shame of Our City' is so good.
walker,"Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story."
fletch,Why not? Oh $hit...really?
fletch,"Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it."
walker,You broke it? You know the source?
fletch,Practically.
walker,What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
fletch,I have pictures of him. Dealing....
walker,So let's go! We run the pictures.
fletch,He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
walker,Who?
fletch,"Well, there we're in a gray area."
walker,How gray?
fletch,I'd say charcoal.
walker," I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?"
fletch,"Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope."
fletch,"'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'"
larry,"Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin."
larry," Not our kind of people, you understand."
fletch, Spot right here.
fletch,Thanks.
larry,You doing a story on this guy?
fletch,Maybe.
fletch,I wonder if that's his doctor.
larry,Only one way to find out.
fletch,We play tennis at the club.
fletch,Yes.
fletch,"Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains."
fletch,That's Babar.
fletch,One. B-a-b-a-r.
fletch,But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
fletch,I don't know. I don't have any.
fletch,No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
fletch,"Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt."
fletch,Mrs. Smith.
fletch,Right.
fletch,Margaret.
fletch,Is she ever. I've got some stories....
fletch, It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
fletch,"Sure, but the end was so sudden."
fletch,"Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy."
fletch,"Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...."
fletch,"Honest, I feel fine. You better be married."
fletch,Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?
fletch,"Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family."
fletch,"Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?"
fletch," Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?"
fletch,"I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?"
fletch,I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
fletch,"Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant."
records nurse, Identification please.
fletch,It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
records nurse, Nothing. They're still there.
fletch,Right. Fine.
pathologist,Hey you!
pathologist,Give me a hand for a second would you doctor?
pathologist,"Come on, come on."
pathologist, Have you ever see a spleen this large?
fletch, Not recently.
pathologist,"Grab this, will you?"
fletch,"Uh, I'm not really prepared. My hands aren't sterilized."
pathologist,You're not going to make this guy any sicker.
pathologist,"You never really get used to the smell, do you?"
records nurse,"Are you all right, Doctor?"
fletch,Where am I?
records nurse,You're in the Records Room.
fletch,I'm fine.
records nurse,Can I get you something?
fletch,"Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding."
records nurse,Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
fletch,"Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother."
records nurse,Oh my God!
fletch,It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
fletch,"Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something."
records nurse,"Yes, right away."
records nurse,"Here you are, Doctor."
fletch,Thank you.
records nurse,Is there anything particular you're looking for?
fletch,"My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it."
records nurse, Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
fletch,That's it?
records nurse, That's it.
fletch, This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
records nurse,I guess not.
fletch, He'll be so relieved.
fletch,Christ.
gillett,"Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch."
fletch,What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
gillett,I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
fletch,I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
fletch,One on one?
fletch,And the foul.
gillett,You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
fletch," She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it."
gillett,I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
fletch,It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
gillett,"Until she remarries, Fletch."
fletch,"Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this."
gillett,"I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out."
fletch,She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that....
gillett,You should have proved that in a court of law.
fletch,My lawyer was a bum.
gillett, I agree.
fletch,"I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too."
gillett,You may be right.
fletch,Are you serious?
gillett," That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars."
fletch,Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
fletch, I think I just won a million dollars!
fletch, Damn...lost again. Sorry.
gillett,"This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages."
gillett,Cash. I'm impressed.
fletch,Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
gillett,Till then.
fletch,Thank God.
hearn,How about Fletch?
jabbar,"Well, Fletch has been great. He's super-strong, really clogs the middle for us, boxes out, gets the bounds...."
hearn,Now here's a key play in Tuesday night's game....
fletch,Gail Stanwyk!
fletch," I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great."
fletch,"Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours."
fletch,We used to fly together. I'm...John.
fletch,John Ultrarelamensky.
fletch,It's Scotch-Rumanian.
fletch,So were my parents.
fletch,Please.
waiter,Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
fletch,"Yes, I'm with the Underhills."
waiter,"They just left, sir."
fletch,They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
waiter,Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
fletch,Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
waiter,Very good sir.
fletch,You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
fletch,Preoccupied with what?
fletch,Good. Lobs are a very important part of the game.
fletch,Why do you keep doing this?
mrs stanwyk,I love the outfits.
fletch,Try stepping into the ball with your left foot.
fletch,"There, much better."
mrs stanwyk,Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
fletch,I have this effect on lots of women.
mrs stanwyk,I bet you do.
fletch,"Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?"
mrs stanwyk, Alan's in Utah.
fletch, I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
mrs stanwyk,"Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?"
fletch, I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
mrs stanwyk,"If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman."
fletch,You are a rich woman.
mrs stanwyk,See what I mean?
fletch,What's he doing in Utah?
mrs stanwyk,"None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off."
fletch, ...then who walks in but George Bush. He took one look around the room...
fletch," ...and said 'Sorry Mr. President, I thought it was Saturday.'"
fletch,I thought I was going to die.
secretary,"Sugar, Mr. Poon?"
fletch,Thank you.
fletch,Okay.
fletch,"First of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. I'm not going through formal channels here, because if Alan Stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know I was even ---"
boyd,Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off ---
fletch,"Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats."
boyd,Unbelievable.
fletch,I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
boyd,"Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face."
fletch, God I admire you.
boyd,By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
fletch,Comanche Indian.
fletch," Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick?"
margie,Jim Swarthout?
fletch,Yeah.
margie,"And, I'm sorry, who are you again?"
fletch, Frieda's boss.
margie, Who's Frieda?
fletch, My secretary.
fletch,See if you've got anything in Stanwyk's background from when he lived in Utah. Also check on a realtor in Provo named Swarthout. And tell Frank I'm crazy about him and I'd like to discuss his maybe moving in with me.
fletch,Later.
creasy,Fletch! Take off!
creasy,What are you doing?
fletch,They're after Gummy again. It's weird.
creasy," Fletch, slow down."
fletch,"Hey, what are you doing?"
creasy,"Fletch, this is dumb."
fletch,"You don't have to run with me, Crease."
fletch,Why are you beating up on that kid?
fletch,"He's defenseless, and you kick the crap out of him. What do you want from ---"
creasy,Fletch!
fletch,What goddamn right do you have to take him?
creasy,Fletch!!!
creasy,Hey you're really nuts.
fletch, They didn't do anything.
creasy,What? What are you talking about?
fletch,"I busted their window, they didn't do anything."
creasy,You're lucky.
fletch,Not luck. They don't want me.
fletch,Gummy and two cops....
fletch,"Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here."
walker,Your onto something. That's good. What?
fletch,"I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?"
walker,What do you want?
walker,"Speak, don't point!"
larry,I need Fletch for a second.
fletch,"She needs me, Frank."
larry,"Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did ---"
fletch,"That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while."
walker,"Just give me a hint, all right?"
fletch,All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
larry, Did you say cops?
fletch,Yeah.
larry,"That's one thing I did find. It's from Last month, so it was in the unsorted pile."
walker,What's that?
fletch," I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank."
walker,Utah?
fletch,Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
walker,What about finding the source?
fletch,I have some ideas.
walker,Who? Donnie and Marie?
fletch,"Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt."
walker,"Go to transportation, get a ticket."
larry, My hero.
fletch,Nothing to it.
fletch,"Hi, Jim Swarthout, please. Oh, hello, my name is Igor Stravinski and I'm looking for some ranch property."
swarthout,"Good, Mr. Starinski, what'd you have in mind?  Uh huh. Oh are you a friend of Alan's?"
fletch,"No, I just heard some people at the club talking about the property you sold him, and the way it was described, three million sounded like a pretty good price.  What?"
fletch,"Are you sure?  Of course. I guess I was misinformed. Listen, I'd love to come out and see you anyway. When are you available?"
swarthout,"Well, I'm about to close up shop and go out for the evening. How about first thing in the AM?  Great. See you tomorrow."
fletch,Tomorrow.
fletch, What's your name fella? Fluff? Pom-pom?
fletch,Sh*t.
fletch, Sit-tuh!
fletch,Roll over. Play dead. Good boy.
fletch,You any relation to Doctor Dolan?
fletch,I hate this.
fletch,"Make sure nobody comes in, okay?"
fletch,Suck on this Cujo!
fletch,"Gimme a smile! There you go...oh, that's a nice one...  Everything's fine, now...go take a little nap...."
fletch,Look! Defenseless babies!
fletch,That dog is such an A**hole.
fletch,"'Bil-lie, Bil-lie...'"
fletch,"If I took that out, you guys couldn't fit in here."
fletch,You just planted that.
fletch,Read me my rights.
fletch,Hold it! I'll waive my rights.
sergeant,"Who we booking here, gentlemen?"
sergeant,Oh Yeah?  You'll like the Chief. Nice man.
fletch,I hear he's mellowed a lot since he came out of the closet.
sergeant,I find he gets real mellow after he hits somebody a lot.
cummings,Easy fellas.  Be with you in just a second.
fletch,You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
cummings, So what's your name?
fletch,Fletch.
cummings,Full name.
fletch,Fletch F. Fletch
cummings," I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?"
fletch,I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation.
cummings,Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
fletch,"Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probaly explains the curious feeling of love I have for you."
cummings,For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin....
fletch,"It was planted on me, sir."
cummings,"We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want...Jane Doe?"
cummings,Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing.
cummings,"I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men."
fletch,'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
cummings,"You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops."
cummings,"If you keep nosing around, you make the bad guys just a little bit more cautious. That makes my job harder. And if you print your story this week, you might get some of my men killed. I can't let that happen, Mr. Fletch."
cummings,"You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it."
fletch," Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great."
fletch,I don't like Tommy Lasorda.
fletch,You can't keep me here.
cummings,Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
fletch,"I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights."
cummings,"After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore...but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way."
fletch,"My God, you're serious."
cummings,Ask anybody.
fletch,Can I ask anybody now?
fletch,Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
cummings, What'll it be Fletch?
fletch,"I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?"
cummings, Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
cummings," Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?"
fletch,Not a prayer.
cummings,That a boy.
cummings,Thanks for coming down to see us.
fletch,"Not at all, Chief. But next time...no tongue, okay?"
fletch,How could you call him?
walker,"It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about."
fletch,It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
walker,Get out of here.
fletch,"He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story."
walker,"You know, I've had it up to here with your bullsh*t. I need a story from you by tomorrow."
fletch,You'll have it.
walker,"But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse sh*t paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs."
fletch," Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank."
walker, I want something I can print!
fletch, Print this Frank.
fletch,"Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?"
waiter,"In her cabana, sir."
fletch,"Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?"
waiter,Cabana one.
fletch,One.
waiter,"Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?"
fletch,"I would, actually."
waiter,"Charged to the Underhills, sir?"
fletch,Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
waiter,"Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion."
fletch, I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
waiter,I recommend it.
fletch,Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
waiter,"Very good, sir."
fletch,This is just the nicest place.
fletch,It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
fletch,Hi.
fletch,I was hoping you'd say that.
fletch,Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
fletch,I ordered lunch.
fletch,"Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be."
fletch,"No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today."
fletch,"Here, take mine."
fletch,Yes.
fletch,Lunch....
fletch,Come on in.
waiter,You want I set up?
fletch,"No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill."
waiter,Muchas gracias.
fletch,Sierra del fuego.
fletch, I saved his life during the war.
fletch,No. He was. I got him out.
waiter,"Your guest, sir."
waiter,I believe he's with Mrs. Stanwyk.
waiter,Yes sir.
fletch,"'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes....'"
fletch,"'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching....'"
fletch,"'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'"
fletch,Can I ask you a question?
fletch,Are you still in love with Alan?
fletch,Why'd you let me in?
fletch,"Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?"
fletch,Good point.
fletch,What about his parents?
fletch,How come?
fletch,Thanks for the great time.
fletch,Long story.
fletch,Take one end.
fletch,"I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk."
fletch,"Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him."
fletch,Yeah.
fletch, Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
fletch,Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
fletch,"So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth."
fletch,That's what I want to know.
fletch,He told me he was dying of cancer. Not True. That ranch you thought you were paying for in Utah? Not true.
fletch,"He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad."
fletch,Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
fletch,"Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush."
fletch,You saw a forgery.
fletch,That's the real deed.
fletch,Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented....
fletch,I don't know. All I know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.
fletch,I'm really sorry I have to tell you all this.
fletch,"No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me."
fletch,"Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?"
fletch,I'll take you to a game.
fletch,I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
fletch, Act natural.
fletch,"If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?"
fletch,Jesus.
fletch,Should've known. Goddamn it.
fletch,"Great. First I'll get a speeding ticket, then they'll shoot me. Terrific."
fletch,"All right, fella, smog check. Move over."
teenager,Holy sh*t!
fletch,"Sorry, youngster, but we have to see what kind of fluorocarbons this thing puts out at ninety-five."
teenager,Holy sh*t!
fletch,Don't worry about the speed limit. That's what the police escort's for.
teenager,"Okay, okay, just stop, will you. I admit it. I stole it. I was just taking it for a little joy ride, that's all...."
fletch,Holy sh*t.
fletch,"Okay, kid. Just stand here with your hands on the car and wait for the cops. I gotta pee. Here, take my hat."
speaker,...and he can truly be called the Father of Internal Bushings.
fletch, Hello. I'm with the hotel catering. Are you enjoying your meal? Carrots overcooked?
speaker,And now a man who needs no further introduction....
fletch,"Thank you, Tony, thank you. As a lifelong friend of....  ...Fred Dorfman, I'm thrilled to be here."
fletch,Many of you are probably not aware of Freddie's lifelong commitment to honoring a profession that frequently goes unsung -- the police. Many times Fred used to forsake a night with his wife and children to go out an sell tickets for the Policemen's Benevolent Association.
fletch,"Our men in blue are with us today, and I think we should all extend a shake of the hand, a slap on the back and a 'howdy' to them."
fletch,When was the last time you hugged a cop? Do it for my good friend Tommy Lasorda. Doesn't it feel good? Don't you wish you'd done it long ago?
fletch,"Let them know how we feel, with a song. For every cop on every beat in every city of this great nation.  'For he's a jolly good fellow....'"
clerk,"Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class."
fletch,You're kidding.
clerk,Would you like me to change anything?
fletch, So he's going. Uh...are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
clerk,"We'd have no way of knowing that, sir."
fletch,Hmm. It's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and...is there anyone in the seat next to me?
clerk,"Yes, there is. Cavanaugh."
fletch,Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
clerk,You mean her.
fletch,What?
clerk,"Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here."
fletch,"Oh, thanks."
clerk,She's from Utah.
fletch,'Bom-ba-bom-bom...bommmm.'
voice,Who the hell are you?
man,Get up.
fletch,The door was unlocked.
man,Lock's busted.
fletch,No wonder.
man,I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
fletch,I commend him on his choice.
man,What?
fletch,I commend him on his choice
fletch,I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
man,Who are you?
fletch,Don Corleone. I'm a cousin of Mrs. Cavanaugh's.
fletch,Where is she?
man,Moved out.
fletch,She moved out?
fletch,I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
man,She moved out.
fletch,So you're saying she moved out.
man,This morning.
fletch,"This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over."
man,What did you want under the bed?
fletch,Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
man,I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
fletch,I'm her cousin.
man,Tell the cops.
fletch,Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
fletch,I'm getting real tired of all this hostility.
fletch,"Evening.  They oughta recall these things. One bump,the whole window goes."
fletch, Are you Mr. Marvin Stanwyk?
fletch,I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
marvin, Harry S. Truman?
fletch,My parents were great fans of the former President.
marvin,Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
fletch,Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
marvin,"Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?"
fletch,Right.
marvin,"Well, I'm fully covered."
fletch,"I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub-insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son."
marvin,"Yes. Where you from, Harry?"
fletch,California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
marvin,Come on in.
fletch,"First, a couple of routine things: are you and you wife currently alive?"
fletch,"Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named...."
marvin,Velma.
fletch,"Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?"
marvin,Check.
fletch,"Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?"
marvin,"Oh, about ten days ago."
fletch,Ten days ago?
marvin,That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
fletch,Isn't that nice. Since when?
marvin,Since he moved to L.A.
fletch,"Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo."
marvin,What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
fletch,"Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy."
marvin,"Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his."
velma,"Cute young thing, too."
fletch,I'm sorry?
velma,His bride. Cute as a button.
fletch,You've met her?
marvin,"Well, of course we have. He brings her with him."
fletch,Has Alan ever mentioned the name Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
fletch,Has he?
marvin,"Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?"
fletch,Then he has.
marvin,Course he has. That's his wife.
fletch,"Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?"
velma,Cute thing.
fletch, Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
velma,"Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some."
fletch,And they're still married...Alan and Sally Ann.
marvin,Of course they are.
velma,She's cute as a button.
fletch,How long have they been married?
marvin,"Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A...four years April."
fletch,"Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to ---"
velma,"Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?"
fletch," No, thank you."
velma,How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party?
fletch,Frank told you that?
larry,"I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday."
fletch,"You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank."
larry,I just thought...sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
fletch,"Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar."
fletch,'welluh bless my soul whatsuh wrong with me? I'ma itchin' like a man Inuh fuzzy tree....'
fletch,Yeah...No kidding. The Marriott at LAX. Sonofabitch...Checked in this morning. Great. Thanks a million. And call Gail Stanwyk at the Racquet Club. Tell her I have to meet her tonight. Eight o'clock at the club. Urgent and confidential. Thanks.
fletch,Question:
fletch,Question....
tape recorder," Day three on the beach. Fat Sam still hasn't moved, and ---"
fletch, What's wrong with my life?
fletch,Question: Why does a man marry a millionaire's daughter in Beverly Hills if he is already married to a girl who lives in a crappy one bedroom apartment in Utah? Answer: Three million dollars. Big Question: What's with Stanwyk and Cummings? I don't know. Bigger Question: Why does Stanwyk want me to kill him?
fletch," Miss, I believe this has already been eaten."
fletch,"What's wrong, Gail?"
fletch,No.
fletch,I think you better sit down.
fletch,"Gail, please."
fletch,"I got this from Alan's parents. By the way, they see him all the time."
fletch,I checked. There was no divorce.
fletch,I'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
fletch,And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
fletch,"I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow."
fletch,You cant do that.
fletch,They're trying to kill me!
fletch,"You're going to have to trust me, Gail. You have to. Now listen to me: he's expecting you to go to your meeting tomorrow night. Do it. Stay out of the house."
fletch,Come here.
surfer cop,A Sufi junkie.
fletch,Gum?
fletch,I'm the Sufi.
gummy,Fletch?
fletch,Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
gummy,What?
fletch,"Cops are here. I can smell them. They're after me. Lie down, Gum."
gummy,Why are they after you?
fletch,"Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy."
fletch,Sit back down.
fletch,Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
gummy,What's that?
fletch,He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
gummy,I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
fletch,Sure you did.
gummy,"Fletch, I never sold nothing."
fletch,Twenty years.
fletch,"Can't do a thing with this robe. One more question, Gum...don't look at me."
fletch,Where does the Chief get the drugs?
gummy,"I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget."
fletch,"Rio de Janeiro, maybe?"
gummy,"Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?"
fletch,That's Brazil.
gummy,Yeah. Maybe.
fletch,"Wait here for me, Gummy."
fletch,It's the only way you'll be safe. Believe me.
fat sam,Jesus.
fletch,You don't know me.
fat sam, My pleasure.
fletch,"I'm serious, Sam."
fat sam,"What, the heat here?"
fletch,Affirmative.
fat sam,The two surfer boys?
fletch,Affirmative.
fat sam,Thought so. What for?
fletch,"For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy game me a deposition."
fat sam, You gonna nail the chief?
fletch,I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or ---
fat sam,"Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort."
fletch,You don't have a piece of the action?
fat sam,Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
fletch," Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that."
fat sam,Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
fletch,What?
fat sam,You find the source?
fletch,Gum thought Brazil.
fat sam,"Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive."
walker,Fletch....
fletch,"I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight."
walker,What?  Who the hell are they?
fletch,"This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. "
walker,What....
fletch,"Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship."
walker,"Jesus H. Christ.  Fletch, this is the greatest."
fat sam,"He's some reporter, this guy."
fletch,"I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me."
walker,"Fletch, I got nervous. Please...."
fletch,Forget it.
fletch,I'm going to write the story. Just hold the last couple of paragraphs till ten o'clock tonight.
fletch," Make yourselves comfortable, guys, but don't leave the office."
walker,Fletch!
walker,"Fletch, you want an apology?"
fletch,"You were going to can me, right?"
walker, Not really.
fletch,Not really?
walker,I was upset.
fletch,I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
walker,Fletch.
fletch,I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
fletch," Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe."
fletch,"Read this, please."
fletch,Cut the crap and read it.
fletch," Unless my people hear differently, this letter goes out at midnight."
john boyd,CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD BOYD AVIATION
fletch,Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
fletch,You shouldn't be here.
fletch,"He doesn't read my stuff well.  That was stupid, Alan."
fletch,Ahem.  'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'
fletch,"'By the way, Alan is a very big drug smuggler, but you can read all about that in tomorrow's paper. Sincerely yours, I.M. Fletcher. P.S. Have a nice day.'"
fletch,The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
fletch,"How similar in build you and I are. then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up."
fletch,Whoops.
fletch,"That is a lighter, isn't it?"
cummings,"Greetings, everyone."
fletch," Thank God, the police."
cummings,"Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them."
fletch,"Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?"
cummings, Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
cummings,Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
cummings,"What, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear you say something about Rio, Alan. You're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars I staked you for the next load, are you?"
fletch,"Whoa. Well, you two obviously have a lot to talk over, so we'll go catch the last ten minutes of Dynasty."
cummings,Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my a** on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
fletch,...with your money.
cummings,This one's going to be even more fun.
fletch, Go ahead. Make my evening.
fletch,I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
gail,Where are you going?
fletch,Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around.  Don't go back in there.
gail," I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?"
fletch, You sure did.
waiter, Your call is come through.
fletch,"Far out.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought."
fletch,"I gotta go, Lar."
gail,"John Ultramalensky, right?"
fletch,Right.
gail,"God, I haven't seen you since the wedding."
fletch,"Gee, I must have been sh*t-faced at your wedding, I don't ---"
gail,"Not mine, stupid. Yours."
fletch, What are you doing here?
gail,"I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you."
fletch,No problem.
fletch,"Basketball, of course, was invented in France, and is played with a large ball, two tongue depressors and a fish...."
