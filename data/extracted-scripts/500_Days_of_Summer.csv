Speaker,Dialogue
narrator,This is a story of boy meets girl.
narrator,"The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New Jersey, grew up believing that he'd never truly be happy until the day he met his... ""soulmate."""
narrator,"This belief stemmed from early exposure to sad British pop music and a total misreading of the movie, ""The Graduate."""
narrator,"The girl, Summer Finn of Shinnecock, Michigan, did not share this belief."
narrator,"Since the disintegration of her parents' marriage, she'd only loved two things. The first was her long blonde hair."
narrator,The second was how easily she could cut it off... And feel nothing.
narrator,"Tom meets Summer on January 8th in a San Francisco office building. In an instant, he will know she's the one he's been looking for."
narrator,This is a story of boy meets girl.
narrator,"You should know up front, this is not a love story."
paul,I didn't know who else to call.
girl,You did the right thing. Where is he?
girl,Thomas.
tom,Rachel? What are you doing here?
tom,Help me how?
rachel,"First, put down the plate."
rachel,Now come here and sit down.
rachel,The key is not to panic.
tom,I think I'm gonna be sick.
rachel,Drink this.
mckenzie,What is that?
rachel,Vodka.
tom, More.
tom,Does Mom know you're here? It's
rachel,Don't worry about it. Start from the beginning. Tell us what happened...
tom,I thought it was a great day.
rachel,And then what happened?
tom," God, I love eating pancakes at night. It's like the greatest thing ever. How great is this?"
summer,I think we should stop seeing each other.
rachel,Just like that?
tom,Just like that.
paul,Did she say why?
summer,This thing. This whatever it is. You and me. Do you think this is normal?
tom,I don't know. Who cares about normal?! I'm happy. Aren't you happy?
summer,You're happy?
tom,You're not?
summer,All we do is argue!
tom,That is such a lie!
rachel,Maybe she was just in a bad mood.
paul,A hormonal thing.
rachel,P.M.S.?
tom, What do you know about PMS?
rachel,More than you.
tom,Oh my god.
mckenzie,Please continue.
summer,"This can't be a total surprise. I mean, we've been like Sid and Nancy for months."
tom,"Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy seven times with a kitchen knife. We've had some disagreements but I hardly think I'm Sid Vicious."
summer,No... I'm Sid.
tom, So I'm Nancy?!
summer,Let's just eat and we'll talk about it after. I'm starving.
summer," Mmm, you're so right. These are great!"
summer, What?
summer,"Tom, don't. Come back. You're still my best fr---"
paul,Jesus.
mckenzie,That's harsh.
tom,I don't know what I'm gonna do.
rachel,You're gonna be fine.
tom, I'm gonna throw up.
mckenzie,Or that.
rachel,Here.
mckenzie,Come on Hansen. You'll be ok. You're the best guy I know. You'll find someone.
paul,You know what they say...there's plenty other fish in the sea.
tom,No.
paul,Sure they do. They say that.
tom,Well they're wrong. It's not true. I've fished in that sea. I've jumped in and swam in that sea! I'm fucking Aquaman!  Sorry. What I mean is... there are no other fish. This was my fish.
tom,I'm in love with Summer.
paul, For real?
tom,"For real, Paul. I'm madly in love with that girl."
paul,Oh shit.
mckenzie,"Now I know this may be a little risque...but if New Hampshire Greetings wants the jump on those conservative, right-wing neo-Nazis at Hallmark, maybe playing it safe is the wrong approach. The nuclear family is dead and we need a new holiday to recognize that."
mckenzie,May 21st. Other Mother's Day.
vance,"Hmmm. That's an intriguing idea McKenzie. Along with Grossman's ""Magellan Day"" I'd say we've got some potential here. What do you think Hansen? Could you write up some prototypes for these?"
summer,"Excuse me, Mr. Vance? There's a"
vance," Everyone this is Summer, my new assistant. Summer just moved here from..."
summer,Michigan.
vance,"Right. Michigan. Well, Summer, everyone. Everyone, Summer. Excuse me, I have to take this."
summer,Nice to meet you all.
tom,What do we know about this new girl?
mckenzie,Who?
tom,The new girl. Summer. In Vance's office.
mckenzie,Dude. I hear she's a bitch from hell!
tom, Really?
mckenzie,Patel tried to talk to her in the copy room. She was totally not having it.
tom,Maybe she was just in a hurry.
mckenzie,"And maybe she's some uppity, better than everyone, superskank."
tom,Damn.
mckenzie,I know. She's pretty hot.
tom,That makes me so mad! Why is it pretty girls always think they can treat people like crap and get away with it?
mckenzie,Dunno.
tom,"Like, just cause she has high cheekbones and soft skin..."
mckenzie,...and really good teeth.
tom,"And maybe the world's most perfect breasts...Just cause of that stuff, she can walk around like she's center of the universe?"
mckenzie, Women.
tom,Ugh. You know what? Screw her! We haven't even met and I can't stand her already.
summer,The Smiths.
summer,I love The Smiths.
tom,Sorry?
summer,I said. I love The Smiths. You have good taste in music.
tom, You like the Smiths?
summer," ""To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die."" Love it."
tom, Oh my god.
tom,Hi.
summer,Hello.
tom,"So, uh, Summer..."
summer,Tom.
tom,Yeah! How's it going so far?
summer,The city or the firm?
tom,Both... Either.
summer,I'm happy. Still getting situated. How long have you worked here?
summer,Really? Jesus. Did you always want to write greeting cards?
tom,Are you nuts? I don't even want to do it now.
summer,What is it you want to do?
tom,I studied to be an architect actually.
summer,That's so cool! What happened?
tom,"Eh, you know. Same old story. Moved to the city to work for a company. Company went under. Needed a job. My friend worked here. Got me this."
summer,And are you any good?
tom, Well I wrote that one.
summer," ""Today You're a Man. Mazel Tov on your Bar Mitzvah."""
tom,It's a big seller.
summer,"I meant, are you any good as an architect?"
tom,Oh... No. I doubt it.
summer,"Well, I'd say you're a perfectly ...adequate... greeting card writer."
tom,"Why thank you. That's what they called me in college. ""Perfectly adequate"" Hansen."
summer,"They used to call me ""Anal Girl."""
summer, I was very neat and organized.
summer,"Anyway, I should get back."
tom,"Ok, well, I'll see you around."
tom,And it turns out she's read every Graham Greene novel ever published. Her desk is lined with Magritte posters and Edward Hopper.
rachel,Your favorites.
tom,We're so compatible it's insane! Seriously! It doesn't make sense! She's not like I thought at all. She's... amazing.
rachel,Oh boy.
tom,What?
rachel,"You know...just cause some cute girl likes the same bizarro music you do doesn't make her ""the one."""
tom, Of course it does.
sarah,Pause and come eat.
tom,Hey Martin.
rachel,He met a girl.
sarah, Yeah?
rachel, Yeah.
sarah,Oh shit.
narrator,"When one strongly believes in something, it takes overwhelming contradictory evidence to change their minds."
narrator,"Tom had always been a devout believer in the idea of ""true love.""  The evidence did not support him."
narrator,Exhibit A: Lisa Rayner.
narrator,Exhibit B: Wendy Wilson.
tom,I'm so glad we decided to go away together Bec. I know we've only been dating a few months but it's been...awesome.
narrator,Exhibit C: Rebecca Myles.
tom,"And now, you and me, 8 days in Mexico... best spring break ever!"
rebecca,I think we should see other people.
narrator,"And, finally... Exhibit D: Amanda Heller."
amanda,It's just... it's complicated.
tom,What's complicated? Last week you said you loved me!
amanda,I know it's sudden but...
tom,"No, this can't be. Everything was going so great. I don't understand."
amanda, Here.
tom,What's this?
amanda,"Because you're, like, the biggest music nerd I've ever met, I think this should really help explain where I'm coming from."
amanda,You remember how much I loved this song when you first played it for me?
tom,Sure. It's all you wanted to listen to for weeks.
amanda,"Right. And I still like it, don't get me wrong. It's just... When I hear it now, I don't feel the same...rush."
tom, Ok...
amanda,I press the skip button.
tom,What does this have to do with--?
amanda,I'd rather listen to something else.
tom,But Amanda... this is a great fucking song!
tom,It's off.
paul,What?
tom,Me and Summer.
mckenzie,Was it ever on?
tom,No. But it could have been. In a world where good things happen to me.
paul,"Yeah well, that's not really where we live."
tom,No.
mckenzie,So what happened?
tom,You ready for this?
tom,Summer...
summer,Yeah?
tom, So how was your weekend?
summer,It was good.
tom,You believe that shit?
mckenzie,What shit?
paul,I think I missed something.
tom,"""It was good."" She didn't say ""It was good."" She said ""It was good."" Emphasis on the good. She basically said ""I spent the weekend having sex with this guy I met at the gym."" Fucking whore. Screw her. It's over."
mckenzie,What the hell is wrong with you?!
paul,"Dude, you got problems."
tom,She's not interested in me. There's nothing I can do.
mckenzie,"Based on...""it was good?"" TOM And some other things."
paul,"Like what, she said ""hey"" instead of ""hi"" cause that totally means she's a lesbian."
tom,I gave her all sorts of chances.
summer,I'm going to the supply room. Anyone need anything?
mckenzie,No thanks.
tom,I think you know what I need.
tom,Toner.
summer,"Oh ok, sure, no prob."
tom,Do you want to go out with me?
tom,"And the Priest says, ""But we're already out!"""
summer,That is hilarious!
tom,I know!
tom,Not once did she take the bait. Not once. Screw it. I'm done with her. It's over.
mckenzie,This Friday. 10 bucks all you can karaoke at The Well.
tom,No way McKenzie. Absolutely not.
mckenzie,"Come on!  ""Take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and they got big titties!"""
tom,They won't let you back in there after last time.
mckenzie,I wasn't that bad.
tom,"Not at all. You just threw up on the stage, tried to fight the bartender, and then threatened to burn the place down before passing out on the sidewalk. Quiet night for you."
mckenzie, You saved my life that day.
tom,We are not going back there.
mckenzie,"This is a work thing, Tommy. It won't be like that. The whole office is going."
tom,I really can't. Even if I wanted to. There's a lot of stuff I gotta take care of.
mckenzie,You're not listening to me.
tom,What?
mckenzie,The whole office is going. Tom looks over to where Summer sits. And realization dawns on him...
tom,Hi.
summer,Hey! They said you weren't coming.
tom,You asked if I was coming?  I mean...my plans got cancelled...
mckenzie, Goddamn that song is brilliant! What's up Hansen?
summer,Ooh that's me.
summer, Ok. I'm the new girl so no making fun of me.
tom,"You were great up there, by the way."
summer,Well you can't go wrong with The Boss.
tom, I hear that.
mckenzie,"Hey, did you know Tom here's from Jersey?"
summer,Yeah?
summer,I named my cat after Springsteen.
tom,No kidding? What's his name?
summer,Bruce.
tom, That makes sense.
mckenzie,So you got a boyfriend?
summer,Me? No.
mckenzie,Why not?
summer,Don't really want one.
mckenzie,Come on. I don't believe that.
summer,You don't believe a woman could enjoy being free and independent?
mckenzie, Are you a lesbian?
summer,"No, I'm not a lesbian. I'm just not comfortable being somebody's ""girlfriend."" I don't want to be anybody's anything, you know? MCKENZIE I have no idea what you're talking about."
summer,"It sounds selfish, I know, but... I just like being on my own. Relationships are messy and feelings are always getting hurt. Who needs all that? We're young. We're in one of the most beautiful cities in the world. "
tom,But...what if you meet someone and fall in love?
summer, Love? You seriously believe in that stuff?
tom,Of course I do.
summer,Interesting. A real romantic.
mckenzie,"Oh you have no idea. This one... embarrassing. There was this one girl,  I gotta tell this story --"
tom,"Summer, hold on... you don't believe in love?"
summer,"I don't even know what that word means. I know I've never felt it, whatever it is in all those songs. And I know that today most marriages end in divorce. Like my parents."
tom,Well mine too but --
summer,"Oh yeah, And I read in Newsweek, there were these scientists who found that by stimulating a part of the brain with electrodes you can make a person fall in ""love"" with a rock. Is that the love you're talking about?"
tom,Well...
summer,"Why, what's your take on it?"
tom,I think it's...kind of a huge thing.
summer, Ok. Looks like we're gonna have to agree to disagree on that one.
mckenzie,"So, uh, who's singing next?"
summer, I'd say it's your turn loverboy.
tom,Nooo. I don't sing in public.
summer,Sure you do. I see you lip-synching to your headphones every morning on your way in.
tom,I don't...
mckenzie,You really do.
summer,It's ok. I like it. Takes a lot of self-confidence to look ridiculous.
mckenzie, Self-confidence! Ha!
tom,"Anyway, I'm not near drunk enough to sing in front of all these people."
summer,Ok then. Let's drink.
tom,It would take at least ten shots to get me to sing.
summer,Bartender!
tom,That's not it.
summer,What is that then?
tom,I have no idea.
summer,I used to watch it every week.
tom,Me too. Why can't we think of the stupid A-Team theme song.
summer,Pathetic.
tom,This is gonna bother me for weeks.
summer,Totally.
mckenzie,"""And I'd proudly stand UP!""  I said stand!"
tom,Oh here we go.
mckenzie, He's the best.
tom,"Ok, let's get you in a cab."
mckenzie,No. I'm gonna walk. I live right down that street. Or that one.
summer, Is he gonna be ok?
tom,He'll be fine.
mckenzie,Hey.
tom,What's up?
mckenzie,Not you. You.  He likes you.
tom," Ok, goodnight McKenzie!"
mckenzie,"I mean... likes you, likes you. For real. Tell her Tom."
tom,Sorry you had to see that. Happens every time we come here. It's unbelievable. Something about that guy and singing for people. I don't know. But at least he didn't --
summer,Is that true?
tom,What?
summer,You know what. Do you...like me?
tom,Yeah. I like you. Of course I do.
summer,As a friend.
tom,Right. As a friend.
summer,Just as a friend?
tom,Yes. I mean... I haven't really thought about... Yes. Why?
summer,Nothing. I just... You're interesting. I'd like us to be friends. Is that ok?
tom,Oh yeah totally. Friends. You and me. That's... perfect.
summer,Cool.
tom,Cool.
summer,"Well, I'm that way. Good night Tom."
tom,G'night Summer.
tom," Friends. Awesome. That's just great. Well done Hansen, you idiot."
summer,Hey!
tom,Hey!
tom,Hey Mr. Vance.
summer,"Yes, Mr. Vance?"
paul,You son of a bitch.
paul,"Last night, karaoke night?"
tom, Shhh.
paul,The same girl you'd been whining and crying and bitching about for weeks now?
tom,I have not been...
paul,The same girl you said was way out of your league and you'd have no chance with no matter what. That girl?
tom,"Paul, seriously..."
paul,Did you bang her?
tom,No!
paul,Blow job?
tom,No!
paul,Hand job?
tom,"No, Paul, no jobs. I'm still unemployed. We just kissed."
paul,"Come on, level with me. As your best friend, who tolerated a whole month of talk talk talk about this girl, nothing but Summer this, Summer that, Summer Summer Summer, I mean you were practically stalking her..."
tom,Shhh!
paul,Oh crap.
summer,"Hi, I'm Summer.."
paul,"Summer, wow what an unusual name. I'm sure I'd remember that if I had heard it before. Tom, how come you've never mentioned you knew such a lovely little lady?  Ok, well, I was just... I'm Paul."
summer,Hi Paul.
paul, I'm a doctor.
summer,Nice to meet you.
paul,"Anyway, I'm leaving now. Pretend I was never here. Tom, talk to you later?... Hey, If any jobs open up..."
tom,If you heard...
summer,Heard what?
tom,Excellent. You ready to go.
summer,"I'm stalking, STARVING!"
tom, He exaggerates!
tom,Check them out.
tom, That is hot.
tom,I am very turned on right now.
summer,Sometimes you can be so judgmental.
tom,Huh?
summer,"I mean, who are you? They're happy. Just mind your own business."
summer,Too soon to say. It's all in the dismount.
tom,"If we're lucky, there won't be a dismount."
summer,I can't believe them. I have like zero patience for PDA.
tom,"I hear ya. If I want to watch people make out, I have big windows and binoculars at home."
summer,Yeah?
tom, No. That would be wrong.
summer,This is fun. You're fun.
tom,Thanks.
summer,"I mean, I just want to say, up front, I'm not looking for anything serious."
summer,Are you cool with that?
tom, Sure.
summer,It freaks some guys out when I say that.
tom, Not me.
summer,"Let's just have fun. Let's just...hang out, no pressure, no labels, no obligations.  Ok?"
tom,Sure.
summer, Wanna hold my hand under the table?
tom,Yeah.
tom,I'll be...back in a sec.
tom,Settle. Don't get too excited. She's just a girl. There's lots of them. Who look like that. And like what you like. They're everywhere. Calm yourself.
tom,Are you calm?  Ok. Then it's time to go back in.
summer,Hi.
tom,Oh sweet Jesus!
tom, I fucking hate Summer.
bus driver,"Son, you're gonna have to exit the vehicle."
tom,It's very... complex.
summer,Complex. Yes.
summer,"In a way, it speaks so much by saying... so little."
tom,I feel the same way.
tom,You wanna go to the movies?
summer, God yes!
tom,"A lot of people have problems with this, but to me, it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that."
tom,"The guy who made this, Maybeck, he is a God."
tom,It just makes you feel... peaceful.
tom,"No. See now, this is torture."
summer,Why?
tom,"Over there, that's St. Patrick's church. The beauty of St. Patrick's is its humility. With this giant mirror thing deflecting all the attention away, it's too humble. No one even knows it's there."
summer,How would you change it?
tom,"There's a million things. First, there's no need for this much glass. You could easily..."
summer,Show me.
tom,What?
summer,Don't talk about it. Do it.
tom,"See this beam, it steps on the landscape. But if we moved it... just so..."
summer,You wanna --
tom,No you go first.
summer,It doesn't matter to me.
tom,Whatever you want.
both, Hey./ Hi.
summer, So how's it going?
tom,Hello?
mckenzie,Your girl is losing it.
summer,This is not at all as easy as it looks.
tom,Ow!
tom,There's no way.
summer,Why not?
tom,"""Octopus's Garden?"" You may as well just say ""Piggies?"""
summer,I told you. I love Ringo.
tom,You're insane.
summer,Why?
tom,Cause nobody loves Ringo.
summer,That's what I love about him.  Ooh.
summer, This got great reviews.
summer,Is that... possible?
paul,So what's going on with you and Summer?
tom,I don't know.
paul,Is she your girlfriend?
tom,I wouldn't say that.
mckenzie,What would you say?
tom,"Like, are we ""going steady?"" Come on, guys. We're adults."
paul,"It's not an unreasonable question. Watch. McKenzie, do you have a girlfriend?"
mckenzie,"No I do not. In fact girls are repulsed by me. Paul, how about you?"
paul,"Why yes, in fact I do. Her name is Robyn. See Tom, it's easy."
tom,It is when you've been with the same girl since high school.
paul,"You've been ""seeing"" this girl, what, two months now?"
tom,Something like that.
paul,And you haven't discussed it?
tom,No! She's not... We're not like that.
paul,Like what?
mckenzie,Normal.
tom,We've just been... hanging out.
paul,Hanging out?!
tom,"Yeah. Guys, look, Summer and I...we know how we feel. We don't need to label it. ""Boyfriend, girlfriend."" That stuff is very... juvenile."
mckenzie,You're so gay.
paul,Well let me ask you this then. Do you want her to be your girlfriend?
tom,I don't know... Maybe.
mckenzie,I heard her Hansen. She's not the girlfriend type. You're gonna need to discuss it.
tom,No. We're adults. It'll be fine.
mckenzie,Have you made her a CD yet?
tom, Maybe.
mckenzie,Oh dude.
paul,You really need to have that talk.
rachel,You were saying?
tom,"My thinking is... why rock the boat? Things are going well. If we start putting labels on it, that's like the kiss of death. Like saying to a girl ""I love you."""
rachel,I know what you mean. That's what happened with me and Sean.
tom,Who the hell's Sean?
rachel,My boyfriend before Mark.
tom,Who the f--! Never mind. Help me. I need solid female advice.
tom,"Yeah but, you know me. This is the kinda stuff that always gets me in trouble."
rachel,"Hmm. So, basically you do want to ask the question, `are we boyfriend/girlfriend?' You're just afraid you'll get an answer you don't want and that will shatter your illusions of how good everything's been these past few months. Is that about right?"
tom, Something like that.
rachel,"Thomas, tell me this. Is it worse to get the wrong answer now... or find out in a month she has a date coming up with Lars from Norway?"
tom,Who's Lars?
rachel,He's a professional surfer with Brad Pitt's face and Jesus's abs.
tom,That son of a bitch.
rachel,You see what I mean?
rachel,Later dude.
tom,"Coach, no, wait! I need her.  Rachel, what do you think I should do?"
rachel, Just don't be a pussy.
summer,Hi.
tom,Hi.
summer,Are you ok?
tom,Yeah.
summer,You sure?
tom,"Summer, I've gotta ask you something."
summer,Ok.
summer,Wait!
summer,Whoa. Oh my god. We can't talk during this song. It's too beautiful.
tom,"I just don't get women's fashion nowadays. Everybody with the tattoos, the giant hoop earrings, those annoying hats. Explain this to me."
summer,People think it looks good.
tom,Do you?
summer,On some.
tom,I like how you dress.
summer,Yeah? What if I started wearing berets and got a huge butterfly tattoo on my leg?
tom, Please don't.
douche, Hey.
summer,Hey.
douche,How's it going?
summer,Ok.
douche,You live around here?
summer,Yeah not too far.
douche,I've never seen you here before.
summer,You're not too perceptive.
douche,Ha. That's funny.
douche,"So, uh, let me buy you a drink."
summer,No thank you.
douche,Are you with this guy?
tom, Hi. I'm Tom.
douche,"Whatever.  Come on, one drink. What are you drinking?"
summer,"Sorry, no thank you."
douche,You're serious? This guy?
tom,Hey buddy --
summer," Don't be rude. I'm flattered, I'm just not interested. Now why don't you go back over there and leave us alone, ok?"
douche,It's a free country.
douche,"So you and him, huh? I can't believe that. Is this guy really your boyfriend?"
tom,Did you see that punch? I don't know where it came from. I haven't punched someone since Josh Greenberg in fifth grade. Guess I'm gonna have to throw out this shirt.
tom,Hey. What is it?
summer,I can't believe you.
tom,What?
summer,You were so completely uncool in there.
tom,You're mad at me? I just got my ass kicked for you.
summer,"Oh that was for me? You were, what, protecting me? Next time Tommy, don't. I fight my own battles."
tom,"Come on, that guy was an asshole!"
summer,You didn't have to hit him. Why didn't you just let me handle it?
tom,I don't know. He was --
summer,See. This is why I don't want a serious relationship.
tom,Whoa. What was that?
summer,"Nothing. Look, I like you Tom. I like this. What we've been doing. But maybe it's gone too..."
tom,What...?
summer,I told you all along what I don't want and it's...
summer,I'm tired. Can we talk about this tomorrow?
tom, I just got my ass kicked!
tom, I got one good shot in.
tom, Hi.
summer, Hi.
tom,What's up?
summer,Nothing.
tom,Ok.
tom,"Wait, are you still mad at me?"
summer, Tom...
tom,Holy shit you are. I can't believe you!
summer, Are you almost done?
tom,Yeah. I'm all done.
tom,You know what... Sometimes you really don't make any sense.
summer,Say you're sorry.
tom,Huh?
summer,Say you're sorry for acting like a jerk.
tom,I am. I'm sorry for acting like a jerk.
summer,Ok. Me too.
tom,Summer... we don't have to label what we're doing. I just... I need -
summer,I know -
tom,Consistency. I need to know you won't wake up tomorrow and feel a different way.
summer,I can't promise you that. Nobody can. Anyone who does is a liar.
summer,I can only tell you how I feel right now... or I can show you.
tom,"Have you ever had a real ""boyfriend?"""
summer,What?
tom,"A boyfriend. ""Going steady."" Whatever. You know what I mean."
summer,Well... yeah.
tom,More than one?
summer,A few.
tom,Tell me about them.
summer,Oh no way.
tom,Why?
summer,Cause there's nothing to tell.
tom,"Come on, I'm interested."
summer,You wanna have the relationship history conversation?
tom,Yes.
summer,You sure about that?
tom,No. Yeah. I don't know. Why not? I can take it.
summer,"Ok. Well, in high school, there was Markus."
tom,Quarterback slash homecoming king?
summer,He was a rower. Very hot.
tom,What happened to Markus?
summer,He works for the Republican party. Very successful. Just not for me.
tom,Ok. And then?
summer,"Well, for a short time in college, there was Kurt."
summer,"That didn't really go anywhere.  And... my semester in Rome. Daniele Belardelli. AKA ""The Puma."""
tom,The Puma?
summer,"Yeah, cause, you know..."
tom,And that's it?
summer,The ones that lasted.
tom,What happened? Why didn't they work out?
summer,Nothing happened really. It's what always happens. Life.
alison,So how long have you known Paul and Robyn?
tom,Since grade school.
alison,"No way, really? That's crazy."
tom,Yeah.
alison,Well I'm glad you called. They spoke very highly of you.
tom,Great.
alison,So...uh... how's it going?
tom,Ok.
alison,You've been pretty quiet.
tom,Sorry.
alison,"I'm pretty quiet too. Usually. It's nice sometimes to be comfortable enough that you can just sit and eat and not have to say anything, you know?"
tom,Uh-huh.
alison,Do you want to try some --
tom,No thanks.
tom,I'm sorry. It's just... there's this girl.
alison,Oh.
tom,"I'm not usually like this. I wasn't before... Long story short, she wrecked me. I don't know if you can tell but it was pretty recent and I'm still kinda thinking about her."
alison, Well maybe you should think about... someone else... who could cheer you up.
tom,"I can't get her out of my head, you know? I see her everywhere. She's all I think about. And it's horrible. Cause I totally didn't see it coming. I thought things were fine. So now I keep going through every day in my mind, every second really. Wondering. What went wrong? Is it my fault? Could I have prevented it somehow?"
tom,"A lot of people have problems with this, but to me, it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that."
summer,"While you continue to talk about buildings and whatever other bullshit interests you, I'll just nod my head and pretend to listen while secretly dreaming about the many ways I can one day rip out your heart and eat it like the rabid vampire I am."
tom,"Maybe there were things I could have said or done, you know?"
alison,Waiter!
tom,"Or... Christ, I don't know, maybe she was never that interested in me to begin with."
tom, How was your weekend?
summer, It was good.
tom,"Anyway... sorry. If I'm acting strange, that's why."
alison,It's ok. I'm sure it's tough getting over an ex-girlfriend.
tom,Actually she was never my girlfriend.
tom,"I just... I thought I'd have figured it out by now, you know? My life. Where I'm going, where I want to end up, who with. All that stuff. I still don't know anything. And the thing is... When I was with Summer, none of that mattered. I never even noticed how much of my life was missing! Isn't that weird?"
alison,"You were in love, that's what it does. But, now that you know where the holes are you can start to fill them."
tom,"Sure.  Hey, I've been talking non-stop. You talk."
alison,Me? Well I grew up --
tom,So what do you think? Did I do something? Did I not do something? What can I do now?
alison,I... 
tom, Oh! You know what we should do...
tom,"""You said you'd stand by your man!/So tell me something I don't understand. You said you loved me!/And that's a fact! And then you left me, said you felt trapped!"
tom,"""You didn't stand by me! Not at all! You didn't stand by me,"" I'm talking about you Summer!"
summer,Hey it's me.
tom,Hello me. You having a good day?
summer,"I am thank you. Listen, about tonight... I think I might just stay in and go to bed early."
tom,What? Why?
summer,I'm just really tired and I've gotta go in early tomorrow. Would you be super mad at me if we went out this weekend instead?
tom,"Well... You don't want to just, maybe, go to dinner. I mean, you've gotta eat right?"
summer,I'm not really that hungry. And this place is fancy right?
tom, Sorta.
summer,"I'd rather not. Seriously, do you mind?"
tom,"Hey, no, that's cool. Whatever you want to do."
summer,"Thank you. So we'll talk tomorrow, alright?"
tom,Sure.
summer,Great. Good night Tom.
tom,"Good night.  Hey, Happy... birthday."
paul,I just got lucky I guess. We met in elementary school. We had the same class schedule in the 7th grade and we just... clicked.
mckenzie,"Love? Shit, I don't know. As long as she's cute and she's willing, right? Actually, cute is a strong word. Not atrocious."
rachel,"That's a pretty complex question. Philosophers, poets, scientists, everybody has a theory, don't they? "
summer,Ok I'm sick of this love shit. Come on! We've been fed this nonsense for generations to the point where it's now genetically encoded in our very beings. And what does it mean? Absolutely nothing. Give me a break!
mckenzie,I'm just saying... I really need some ass. I'm desperate.  You got nothing?
paul,"I wouldn't say ""the girl of my dreams,"" no. The girl of my dreams would have a better rack. Probably different hair, could like sports a little more. But... truth is... Robyn's better than the girl of my dreams.  You know why? Cause she's real."
mckenzie,"Hansen, don't you have like twenty bar mitzvah cards to write?"
tom,Nope. All done. What are you working on?
mckenzie,"Congratulations. But I've run out of ways to say it. ""Good job,"" ""well done,"" ""way to go""... I got nothing."
tom,"Why don't you try... ""Everyday you make me proud. But today, you get a card."""
mckenzie, Shit. That's not bad.
tom,No worries.
tom,"This is good Millie. ""To my wife, the love of my life. I love you."" That's very nice. I was thinking though, why not try something like... ""Everyday that we don't meet is meaningless and incomplete."" You know, spice it up a little."
tom,"Did you try... ""Merry?"""
all,Whoa/Perfect/Yes!
tom,What else you got?
tom,"""...aint no woman got what you got, sista girl. Happy birthday to the lean, sheen, and sizzly mocha queen!""  How's that?"
tom,Yeah. It's pretty cool.
tom,You really want to see this?
summer,It sounds amazing.
tom,"It's, like, all stabbing and shit."
summer,Exactly.
tom,Ok.
summer,"All you take me to are sappy little romances. I want to see some open wounds, damn it. I want carnage."
tom,Fantastic.
tom,Oh shit.
summer,What?
sarah,Hey!
tom, Hi Mom.
tom,"Mom, Martin, this is Summer."
sarah,Summer! Well hello! We've heard so much about you! It's so good to finally meet you.
summer,You too.
martin, Is this the girlfriend?
tom,"Well this is the girl friend I've told you about. I don't know if ""girlfriend"" is the right word..."
sarah,You going to see the serial killer one?
summer,Yes we are.
sarah,Great! Should we save you seats?
summer,Absolutely.
sarah,Ok. We'll see you inside.
tom,Sorry about that.
summer,It's fine.
tom,You wanna go do something else? We can totally bolt.
summer,Did you tell them I was your girlfriend?
tom,What?! No way... I never used that word.
summer,"They seemed to think... I mean, why is your step-dad giving me a hug?"
tom,He's very...loving.
summer,Does he hug all your friends?
summer,You're not having any fun.
tom,You're having enough for both of us.
summer,I'm dancing. I haven't danced in ages. God. Come on.
tom,No.
summer,Come on! I wanna dance with you.
tom,Where were you an hour ago? I might have danced then. I've been standing here by myself this whole time and you didn't look over once.
summer,So you're pissed?
tom,I'm not pissed. Summer... you know I hate this shit.
summer,Then why are you here?
tom,This is what you wanted to do so...we're doing it.
summer,"Yeah well, I didn't need a chaperone. Go home. You're a buzzkill standing there pouting."
tom, That's real nice.
summer,Tom!
tom,"You wanted to see me, Mr. Vance?"
vance,Yes Hansen. Sit down.
tom,Ok.
tom,What do you mean?
vance,"A death in the family, someone taken ill...anything like that?"
tom,No.
vance,"Look, I don't mean to pry. Does this have something to do with Summer leaving."
tom,Who?
tom, Your...?
tom,I'm not following.
vance,"For example, here's something you wrote last week...  ""Roses are Red, Violets are Blue. Fuck You Whore."" Now...most shoppers on Valentine's Day ---"
tom,Mr. Vance... are you firing me?
vance,"No, no, no. Relax Hansen. You're one of our most... adequate writers."
tom,"Ok. Well, I'm sorry. Things for me have been a little difficult."
vance,That's ok. I understand that. I was just thinking... perhaps you could channel your energy into... this.
tom,Funerals and sympathy?
vance,"Misery, sadness, loss of faith, no reasons to live... it's perfect for you. Whaddaya say? Good? Good. Now back to work you go."
tom,What's going on?
paul,We have news.
tom,Ok.
mckenzie,It's about her.
tom,Do I want to hear it?
paul,Thats what we wanted to ask you.
mckenzie,It's just...lately you've been...better.
paul,You've been much much better.
mckenzie,So maybe it's best we don't ever bring her up again.
paul,Just let sleeping dogs lie.
mckenzie,Leave those dogs alone Tom!
tom,"You guys, look, I'm... I appreciate what you're saying and, thank you, really, for putting up with me these past few months. I've been crazy. But I've accepted the fact that she and I were just two very different people who wanted very different things. I wanted to get serious. Shit, I loved her. And I know now, she just isn't the kind of girl who can settle down with one person and be happy. The way I wanted. And she probably never will. There was nothing I could do."
tom,There's no fucking way!
mckenzie,Tom.
tom,It can't be. It's impossible!
paul,It is.
tom,How do you know?
tom,Jesus Christ people! Get a room!
mckenzie,Tom!
mckenzie,I've been calling every five minutes. Are you ok?
tom,What? Oh yeah. Great.
mckenzie,Do you need anything?
tom,Twinkies?
mckenzie,Sorry.
tom,I'm out of twinkies.
mckenzie,Well let's go.
tom,Go... where?
mckenzie,It's Thursday.
tom, Hmm?
tom,Uh...no. I really don't.
tom,"Well I wouldn't say nothing... Actually, that's about right."
tom,You know what...?
tom,Can I say something about the cat?
vance,Well sure. Go ahead.
tom,"This here is, and Rhoda, you know I mean no disrespect... but this... this is total shit."
mckenzie,Tom!
tom,"""Don't give up?"" ""You can do it?"""
tom,"This isn't inspirational. It's suicidal. He tries that jump, I'm writing a sympathy card for that cat. That's the last thing I want to be doing with my life. It's bad enough writing these things for people."
vance,"Hansen, this is a place of business. We don't cut down our co- workers --"
tom,That's cause we're liars! It's what we do here. Why don't we level with people? Stop feeding them nonsense?
tom,Yes but think about it! Why do people buy these things? Not to say how they feel. There's paper and pens for that. People give these cards when they can't say how they feel. Or they're afraid to. And we provide the service that lets `em get away with that!
tom,"I say to hell with it! Let's level with America. Or at least make them speak for themselves! I mean, seriously, what's this...  ""I'm sorry to hear your grandmother has passed."" What the hell? Let's give em some truth. Something like, ""Sorry to hear about your grandmother. Here's a card so I get some credit in your time of need. I'm sure it makes up for the fact that grandma's dead."""
tom,"Think about it.  ""Congratulations on your new baby."" Eh... How bout... ""Congratulations on your new baby... Guess that's it for hanging out. Nice knowing ya, buddy."""
vance,"Hansen, sit down!"
tom," Wait, what's this? Ooh... fancy! Look at this one with all the hearts. Let's open it up. ""Happy Valentine's Day, Sweetheart. I love you."" Oh that's nice."
mckenzie,Tom...
tom,"If someone gave me this card, Mr. Vance... I would eat it."
mckenzie,Tom!
tom," It's these greeting cards, Sir, these cards, these movies, these pop songs. They're responsible for all the lies, the heartache, everything! We're responsible! Everyone shifts in their seats."
tom,"I think we do a bad thing here. People should be able to say how they feel, how they really feel, without some strangers putting words in their mouths. The truth. A card is a nice thought but it shouldn't do the dirty work for you. You love someone, tell them yourself, in your own words. Maybe it's not love at all. Maybe there's no such thing as love. Maybe it's... ""galoogoo.""  Yeah I made it up, so what?!"
tom,"It's all crap. We make and peddle crap. And sometimes people believe in this crap. I just can't do it anymore, Mr. Vance. There's enough bullshit in the world without my help. I quit."
tom,There's no fucking way!
mckenzie,Tom.
tom,It can't be. It's impossible!
paul,It is.
tom,How do you know?
mckenzie,We know.
tom,But... It's May! We broke up last August.
paul,I know.
tom,And you said she was single at Christmas.
mckenzie,She was.
tom,And now she's...
mckenzie,Yeah.
tom,Now she's getting married.
paul,I'm so sorry Tom.
tom,Married?
paul,It's insane.
tom,It's impossible. It doesn't make sense. Where did they meet? Is it someone we know?
paul,No.
tom,So everything she said. All that stuff about... it can't be. Not her. I know her too well. She wouldn't do that.
tom, Fuck!
mckenzie,Tom!
paul,Let him go.
rachel,"Your apple pies are really great. So Uncle Sid and Aunt Ro, come light candle number eight!"
aunt anita,I can't believe that. No girlfriend?
tom,I can't believe it either!
aunt betsy,What are you 30? You should be married now. With a family. What are you waiting for?
tom,The right girl I guess.
aunt betsy,There's girls everywhere. I bet you have to beat em off with a stick.
tom,Oh you'd be surprised.
aunt anita, Look at this punum. Are all those girls blind?
aunt betsy,My friend Mimi has a granddaughter. Yay high. Great figure. Bosom out to here --
tom,"Hey I appreciate that Aunt Betsy. Lord knows I like bosoms. It's just... I recently got out of a...well, I don't know what it was."
aunt anita,Oh I'm sorry. When was that?
tom,July.
aunt betsy,You mean...seven months ago?
aunt anita,Was it a man?
tom,What?
aunt betsy,She's means `are you a homosexual?'
tom,No. Where's that coming from?
aunt betsy,We just always wondered.
aunt anita,So how's work?
tom,Well...glad you came?
summer,Of course. Where am I exactly?
tom,"When you turn 13 in the Jewish religion, you officially become an adult."
summer,Wow. So this is a big day in your sister's life.
tom,"Pretty big, yeah."
summer, So why aren't you smiling?
rachel,Hey brother. Wanna dance?
rachel,Hi.
tom,You having fun? You were great this morning.
rachel,Yeah yeah yeah. Talk to me. How are you?
tom,Me? I'm good. I'm great.
rachel, I heard.
tom,Yeah.
rachel,Sucks.
tom,Yup.
tom,"Anyway, who cares about me? This is your day."
rachel,"You know, my friends... they're all in love with you."
tom,Is that right?
rachel,Look.
tom,That's nice.
rachel,What I tell ya? There are plenty other fish in the sea.
tom,Those are guppies.
rachel,"Who knows, someday one might turn out to be your ""true love."""
tom,Are you making fun of me now?
rachel,No I'm serious.
tom,I got news for you Rach. That true love stuff... it's make-believe.
rachel,Well that's not very romantic.
tom,It's the new me.
tom,Alright... go play with your friends.
rachel,You'll be ok?
tom, Sure.
rachel,Tom.
tom,Hmm?
rachel,I know you think she was the perfect girl for you...  I don't. I think you're just remembering the good stuff. But
tom,Hey.
summer,Hello?
tom,Are you still sleeping?
summer, I'm getting up. What time is it?
tom,10:30. Are we still hanging out today?
summer,Ok. Sure.
tom,I'll meet you at Liberty in... 20 minutes?
tom,So how was last night?
summer,It was fine. Just a work thing.
tom,Where did you guys go?
summer,Some restaurant.
tom,Fun?
summer,Uneventful. Didn't get home until after 12 though which is way too late for a stupid work function. How was your night?
tom,Pretty standard.
summer,You want to go?
tom,I don't know. You wanna maybe go back to your place or ---
summer,I want to see it. Let's go.
tom,Ok cool.
summer,Unless you don't want to.
tom,"No, I will. That's fine."
summer,Ok.
tom,Hey.
tom,"Hey Sum, it's just a movie."
summer,I know. I'm sorry Tom.
tom,Is everything alright with you?
summer,Yeah. I'm just...I'm sorry. I'm being ridiculous.
tom,"It's ok. This happens to me every time I watch ""Hoosiers."" Let's go for a walk, ok. Let's get some air. Or go to Sister Ray's."
summer,Ok.
tom,It pains me that we live in a world where no one's ever heard of Spearmint.
summer,I've never heard of them.
tom,And it's painful. Oh look.
summer,So.
tom,So... Now what?
summer,Now...I think I'm gonna call it a day.
tom,Yeah? You wanna maybe...get some dinner or something?
summer,I've got pasta at home.
tom,Are you hungry?
summer,"I'm pretty hungry, but --"
tom,Ooh!
summer,What?
tom,I've got a great idea!
summer,What?
tom,Let's get breakfast.
summer,Now?
tom,Pancakes?
summer, Where you coming from?
tom,What? Oh. Nowhere. How long have you been sitting there?
summer,Awhile.
summer,"I come here a lot. I always loved this place, ever since you brought me here."
tom,So... I should probably say congratulations.
summer,Probably. But only if you mean it.
tom,I don't know if I do honestly.
summer,I understand.
tom,Yeah well...anyway...I hope you're happy.
summer,You really do?
tom, God no.
summer,"How are you, Tom?"
tom,I'm good. Ish.
summer,That's good.
tom,Yeah I quit the office.
summer,Really? That's great! What are you doing now?
tom,Mostly...sleeping. Breaking things.
tom,So who's the guy?
summer,"Who, my guy?"
tom,Yeah... Wait. Don't tell me. I don't want to know.
summer,Tom...
tom,"No really, I don't."
summer,Ok.
tom,It's amazing to me. You're married.
summer,I know.
tom,"You're not only someone's girlfriend, your someone's wife!"
summer,"Pretty crazy, huh?"
tom, I'll never understand that.
summer,Tom --
tom,What's different now? How could things change so quickly?
summer,I don't know. It just happened.
tom,What happened?! That's what I don't get.
summer,I... Tom...
tom,"What, tell me..."
summer,I woke up one day and I knew.
summer,I knew I could promise him I'd feel the same way every morning. In a way that I... I never could with you.
tom,You know what sucks? Realizing that everything you believe in is complete bullshit.
summer,What is?
tom,"Destiny, soulmates, true love. All that stuff. It's nothing more than silly childhood fairy tale nonsense, isn't it? God!"
summer,"Tom, don't go."
tom,"I should have listened to you, Summer. You were right all along."
summer,I was right?
tom,What? This is funny?
tom,What are you laughing at?
tom, You're a crazy person!
summer,Tom! You're the crazy person!
tom,What are you talking about?!
summer,One day I'm reading a book at the corner deli and this guy sits down and starts asking about it. Now he's my husband!
tom,This is funny to you?
summer,"What would have happened if I went to the movies instead? If I went somewhere else for lunch? If I showed up to eat ten minutes later? Tom, it was meant to be, just like you said. And as it was happening, I knew it. I could feel it, sure as the sun. And I kept thinking to myself ""Holy shit. Tom was right."" You were right about all of it.  It just wasn't me you were right about."
summer,"Anyway, I should probably be getting back. It was good to see you. I'm glad you're well."
tom,Summer!
tom,I really do hope you're happy.
summer,I know.  See you later.
girl,Are you here to interview?
tom,Sorry?
girl,Are you interviewing? For the position?
tom,"Oh. Yeah. Why, are you?"
girl,Yup.
tom,Ah. My competition.
girl,It would appear.
tom,"Gee, this is a little awkward."
girl,Yes it is.
tom,"Well, I hope you don't get it."
girl,"I hope you don't get it. They both laugh. There's a silence for a few beats. And it's during this time that something weird comes over Tom and we can visibly see it in his face. He likes the look of this girl. This girl is cute. He'd like to talk more with her. And, honestly, he's a little surprised by it."
tom,"So, uh..."
girl,Hmm?
tom,Are you from...California?
girl,"Grew up not too far from here. Atherton, near Stanford."
tom,I know Atherton. Nice area.
girl,Have I seen you before?
tom,"I, uh, don't know. I don't think so."
girl,Do you go to St. Patrick's? Not to pray or anything but to stand outside?
tom,I do! I love that church. It's like my favorite structure in the city.
girl,If only it wasn't near that horrible mirrored thing...
tom,Yes! Exactly. I totally agree!
girl,Yeah.  I think I've seen you there.
tom,You have? Really? Hmm. I didn't see you.
girl,It happens. You probably weren't looking.
man,Tom Hansen?
tom,Yes.
man,Come on back.
tom,Thank you.
narrator,If Tom had learned anything... it was that you can't ascribe great cosmic significance to a simple earthly event. Coincidence. That's all anything ever is. Nothing more than coincidence.
narrator,It took a long time but Tom had finally learned. There are no miracles. There's no such thing as fate. Nothing is meant to be. He knew. He was sure of it now.  Tom was...
narrator,...pretty sure.
tom, Excuse me.
girl,Hello stranger.
tom,When this is over... uh... would you like to maybe...grab a cup of coffee or something?
girl,Oh. I'm sorta supposed to meet someone.
tom, Oh. Got it... No problem.
girl,Ok.
tom,What's that?
girl,Why not?
tom,Yeah?
girl,Yeah.
tom,"Great! So... I'll wait for you here, or you wait for me or...something."
girl,We'll figure it out.
tom,Ok!  My name's Tom.
girl,Nice to meet you...
girl,I'm Autumn.
