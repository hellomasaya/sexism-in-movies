Speaker,Dialogue
alexander salkind,presents SUPERGIRL
teacher,"And now, who can give me the electron wave functions for Kryptonian covalent bonding?"
child,The cube root of the wavelength over the natural log of the integral of the speed of light squared.
teacher,"Well, maybe that was a bit too easy..."
kara,What are you making:
zaltar,"It's going to be a tree, I think."
zaltar,"It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went."
zaltar,Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
kara,"Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head."
zaltar,Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
kara,I don't understand.
zaltar,Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
zaltar,"You see, a tree is a living thing."
kara,Can you create life?
zaltar,"No, no, just the illusion of life. A kind of half-life, maybe. A pale shadow of the real thing. But it is lovely, the way the light plays over the surface. . ."
alura,"Kara, you shouldn't be so near the Edge without a grown-up."
kara,"I'm sorry, Mother."
zaltar,I was keeping an eye on her.
alura,"Thank you, Zaltar, but she has to obey the rules."
zaltar,"You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon."
zaltar,"Put your fingers there, Kara. And press hard."
zaltar,"Good. Now, go make something pretty."
zaltar,I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
alura,But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
zaltar,"It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff...."
alura,"But Zaltar---you founded the city! It's yours. We were all just refugees from Krypton when you gathered us together and brought us here, to the inner dimension. You can't abandon us now. You have a responsibility to us!"
zaltar,"I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second."
alura,"How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city."
kara,I'm sorry... I didn't know.
zaltar,It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
alura,"But the Power Source, Zaltar."
zaltar,It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
alura,But what will happen?
george,"You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat."
selena,Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
george,"Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you."
selena,"Why George, are you proposing?"
george,"Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but..."
selena,George---I thought you'd never ask.
george,What the heck is that?
selena,A squirrel Frisbee?
selena,"That's funny. I'd swear I know just what this is, but I've never seen it before."
george,"Hey, where you going?"
selena, I've got things to do.
alura," But Kara, you are too young to go."
kara,I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
kara,It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
kara,I allowed it to escape the City.
alura,"Ever since we told you how your cousin Superman was sent there as an infant, all you have wanted to do was visit this place."
kara,"Yes, I do want to go. But someone must go. Our scanning shows the Power Source has finally reached the Earth. It could destroy everything unless someone brings it back."
kara,"Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-"
kara,I'll have super powers there. Like him. We can't wait. Our lights are fading. Look around you. When I was a child the City was bright and shining. Look at it now.
alura,What do your teachers think?
teacher,"It would be sad to lose one of our finest young ones to the dimension barrier-- but the City cannot last much longer without the Power Source. It is her future she's fighting for, Zor-El."
kara,"Don't worry, Mother, I'll be all right. I've studied the transmissions from Earth. I know their customs."
alura,"But they are such strange, unstable people."
kara,Then I will learn to act strange like them.
kara,"I have made clothing and copies of their money, I will be fine."
kara,As brave as my father. As wise.
bianca,Be careful. Nigel is going to try something.
selena,"Don't worry about old Nigel, I can take care of him. He's just a sore loser."
elderly man,"I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes."
selena,"I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski."
elderly man,No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
nigel,It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
selena,I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
nigel,"You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months."
selena,I just did. Because I have the Power.
nigel,You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
selena,"Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far."
nigel,Cigarette?
nigel,Sorry. Forgot you were trying to quit.
selena,"Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head."
nigel,"You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate."
selena,I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now burn rubber.
nigel,Make me.
nigel,"Balefire on you, Selena!"
selena, You Scorpios can never take a joke.
nigel,You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
nigel,"You won't last a year, Selena. The cards don't lie!"
bianca,Let's not let one rotten apple spoil the party. I give you the first woman in eight hundred years to head the Circle: Selena!
selena,"Thank you, sisters and brothers of the Craft. It is a great honor you have given me, and I will try to be worthy. And when my secret plans are revealed -- you will learn that we are on the threshold of power and influence undreamed of when Nigel was our leader."
selena,"And now, ,I call upon the Great Mother--the spirit of Nature --- to bless all our endeavors in the coming year..."
selena,"It's a warning, that's for sure."
elderly man,Maybe it was just an accident.
selena," There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs."
elderly man,Then what does it mean???
selena,Don't ask me. I can't read the signs worth spit.
myra,"Geeze, another barfy new student. They're really scraping the bottom of the barrel these days."
linda,"Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot."
linda,"The letter's in your files. Under K, for Kent."
linda,"I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it."
mr danvers,"...since your school records were lost in the fire, we'11 start you out easy first. You'll have English, Latin, French, History, Art, Chemistry, Math, Biology and Computing. Later on, you can add some electives. I think we'll put you in ""G"" dorm."
student monitor,Man on the floor!
lucy,"Oh, MR. Danvers, come in and park it."
lucy,It wasn't anorexia. It was the food.
mr danvers,"Linda, this is Lucy Lane. You can room with her. Show her around, Lucy; I believe you know her cousin, MR., uh, Kent. Lucy turns into a bundle of enthusiasm. She grabs Linda's suitcase and leads her into the room chattering away excitedly."
lucy,"Wow, you're Clark's cousin?? Fabuloso! Clark's a hunk. My sister Lois was a real nerd to let that one get away. You'll love it here, we have a great dorm, some really insane characters, I mean radical craziness..."
lucy,No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
lucy,This is all your clothes?
linda,"I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since..."
lucy,Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
linda,I'd rather not talk about it.
lucy,You're not...an orphan are you?
linda,My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
lucy,"Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time."
linda,Thank you. You're very kind.
lucy,"I'm real sorry, Linda, I should've known it was something tragic if you show up without a wardrobe. Here, try on this. And this."
linda,She did that deliberately.
lucy,She's a beast.
linda,Must've been a defective puck.
lucy,Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
lucy,She just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
myra, Are they in?
myra,Listen to the screams when I shut off the cold water.
muffy,"But, Myra, why don't you shut off the hot water and give them an ice bath? If you shut off the cold it, could scald them."
myra,So they lose a little skin. Serve 'em right.
mr danvers,"Now, this is the kind of problem that used to take weeks before the computer. It still takes a long time without certain algorithms."
linda,"Uh, yes, MR. Danvers."
selena,"I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall."
selena,The Coffer of Shadow. Look at it.
bianca,The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
selena,"Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?"
bianca,Softball.
selena,It must be the girls. One of the girls.
selena,Drive on. We have already attracted enough attention.
selena,We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
bianca,"And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!"
selena,"Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?"
lucy,"Hey, Linda, you in there?"
lucy,You're a maniac! Let me do it for you. You'll look awful.
supergirl,"I can manage, thanks."
lucy,I cut my own hair once. I looked so awful the only thing was to go totally punk!
lucy,Your hair looks the same.
linda,It was just a trim.
jody,"Hey guys, Gloria just got a package from home."
jody,A hair dryer that makes popcorn!
linda,No thanks. You go on.
lucy,You sure?
linda,Mother! Is it you? Where are you???
linda,"Mother, this world is so big. I don't know where to begin to look."
linda,But why? I have super powers. Nothing can hurt me.
bianca,Is he your entertainment for tonight?
selena,He will be. In about five minutes.
bianca,Have fun.
ethan,"Well, there's several ways to go ."
selena,"Come in, have a drink, we'll talk."
selena,You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
ethan,I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
selena,I bet they do.
ethan,What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
selena,"Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage."
ethan,Now we could put in rhododendrons or lilacs...depending on how alkaline your soil is.
ethan,"Uh, no thanks, I don't drink during the day."
selena,"But look, it's almost sundown!"
ethan,"Really, I'm not thirsty. Now I could put in some honeysuckle there and there..."
selena,"Just take a sip or .I'll be hurt. It's an old family recipe, I'm famous for them."
selena,A passionfruit smoothee.
ethan,"Well, just one."
selena,To us. And to the seeds we'll plant together.
ethan,"Now, about my fee..."
selena,"Sleep well. And when you wake, drown in my eyes and be all mine."
selena,If that's the Jehovah's Witnesses again...
selena,"Don't go away, gorgeous. I'll be right back."
nigel,I have to talk to you.
selena,You're wasting your breath.
nigel,You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
selena,I could teach you a thing or two now.
nigel,"...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?"
selena,"I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night."
nigel,Nothing's wrong with my skin.
selena,Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
linda,"Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers."
linda,Sure. Mate in five moves.
linda,"...and there goes my king. Got to hand it to you, I didn't see it coming. Well, bye."
selena,Show me Ethan.
lucy,Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
lucy,"Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you."
linda,It doesn't seem right.
lucy,"Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?"
lucy,"What a space cadet.  Hey, you dingleberry! Get outta the street!"
lucy,"I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed."
selena,Power of Shadows...bring him to me.
lucy,"Omigod, it's a runaway!"
lucy,Somebody's gotta do something!!
mother,My baby!!!!!
mother,My baby.
supergirl,Everything's going to be all right. She's just unconscious. No broken bones.
selena,That was meant for me!
supergirl,Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
ethan,Wait...don't leave me in here...
supergirl,It's for your own protection.
supergirl, I'm taking you to the hospital.
ethan, Let me out. I have to talk to you.
supergirl,Later.
policeman,Where's the casualties? You can't tell me there's no casualties.
selena,It's what we were warned about.
ethan,"When can I see, you again ?"
supergirl,Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
first intern,Did we use the laughing gas tonight?
first intern,Then this is really happening.
second intern,"Hey fella, can you talk???"
ethan,The girl. Where is she? It never hit me like this before. I love her. My angel.
ethan,"Where is she? I love her, don't you understand? I'll die if I can't have her."
ethan,"No, not her. The blonde, the one who carried us through the air:. She can fly. She's an angel."
second intern,This is Stenzl in Emergency. We got
ethan,No! She's real ! I saw her !
selena,Why did she have to show up now?
selena,"That's easy for you to say, Bianca."
bianca,You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
bianca,Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
bianca,"That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one."
bianca,The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
selena,Power of Shadow hear me. Find her wherever she be. Find her and destroy her.
selena,"Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard."
bianca,"Yes, of course, it was foolish of me."
selena,I think I'd better keep it.
bianca,Whatever you say.
linda,"Hey, that's my roommate's car!"
supergirl,Leave this place and do no harm.
supergirl,I didn't want anyone to know... but I was so tired...forgot...
supergirl,"Just need rest, that's all. Sorry about all the damage outside. I had to fight some terrible thing..."
supergirl,An evil force. Trying to destroy me.
supergirl,"Thank you, Mr. Danvers."
lucy,"...come see me. And smuggle in a pint, they won't let me have anything, but make sure it's Jamocha Almond Fudge . . Listen, I got to run, my roommate just walked in. Bye."
lucy,"Hey, Linda-babes! I've got so much to tell you, I don't know where to begin! Oh -- this is Jimmy Olsen, he works with Clark and my sister at the newspaper."
jimmy,Nice to meet you. Lucy's told me all about you. Your cousin Clark taught me everything I know about the newspaper business.
linda,I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
lucy,Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
jimmy,Do you have any theories about last night?
linda,Theories?
jimmy,How Lucy and that guy got to the hospital. And all that damage at the school. The police are calling it a freak tornado. I'd like to interview you for the Daily- -
jimmy,"-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?"
linda,I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
jimmy,Can I quote you?
lucy,"Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?"
jimmy,"Oh, sure."
lucy,"Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop."
lucy,Nice? He's cute enough to melt lead!
jimmy,"Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?"
linda,"He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation."
jimmy,I knew it ! He's working on a  hot scoop !
ethan,"Oh no, not you again."
selena,What an adorable hat.
selena,And you think you're in love.
selena,"This ""love"" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion."
ethan,Why should I believe you?
ethan,Then I'm not the only one who saw her. You did too!
ethan,"But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion."
selena,"Forget her, you're mine. I saw you first."
selena,You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
ethan,Nurse!
selena,"Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want."
nurse,Would you stop screaming. There are sick people trying to sleep.
ethan,Get her away from me.  She's crazy.
selena,They're over for you sweetheart.
selena,Now you see who you're dealing with.
selena,"This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you."
ethan,I don't want your help.
selena,Come back to my house. My car's outside.
ethan,No!
selena,I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
security officer,"Okay, what's going on in h--"
selena,Power of Shadow---seize him.
nurse,"Doctor, I think you' re going to have a gas problem."
doctor,I shouldn't have had the cabbage at lunch.
lucy,Omigod.
lucy,"Over by the window. It must be from my sister. Give him a tip, Jimmy."
jimmy,"Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?"
linda,"Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy."
lucy,You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
linda,I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
lucy,"Again? You're getting real tight with them. You're gonna be a straight-A student---just kidding, thanks for coming."
lucy,Phillip! When are you gonna come see me?
jimmy,Can I give you a lift?
jimmy,It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
selena,Give up?
ethan,Never!
selena,What goes up must come down.
jimmy,I probably would've got a ticket without this press pass on the windshield. Does Clark get many tickets?
selena, ...before you get blown off and kill yourself.
jimmy,Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
linda,Yes.
jimmy,The scoop of the year!
selena,It'll be dark soon. And cold. Come down while you've got the chance.
ethan,No. She'll come for me. Like she did the last time. My angel.
selena,She's not coming for you. I killed her. She's dead.
ethan,No. I don't believe you. It's not true. She's alive somewhere. My angel. My love--
jimmy,There goes my Pulitzer Prize.
jimmy,Darn!
jimmy,"Hey lady, did you see that?"
bianca,See what?
jimmy,The girl---dressed like Superman--caught that guy in mid-air.
bianca,Really? Maybe you should check into the hospital and have your head examined.
ethan,You're alive! She didn't kill you!
ethan,That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
ethan,"My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms..."
supergirl,We have to have a long talk about all this.
ethan,I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
bianca,Home?
selena,No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
bianca, Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
selena,"I use men, but I'm not addicted to them. I can quit whenever I want."
ethan,This is my favourite place in the city.
supergirl,Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
ethan,"They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre."
ethan,Like it?
supergirl,Yes. It reminds me of home.
ethan,Where Superman's from? Krypton?
supergirl,No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
ethan,"I'm sorry, I don't understand."
supergirl,It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
ethan,"Come on, let's ride."
ethan,I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
supergirl,"Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you."
ethan,"Let's talk about us, not her."
supergirl,Tell me where I can find her.
ethan,I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news.
supergirl,But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
ethan,I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
supergirl,We can't do that.
ethan,Why not ?
supergirl,We're from different worlds.
ethan,Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
supergirl,"All this talk about love, it's silly."
ethan,You don't like me? You hate me?
supergirl,Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
ethan,What do you feel about me?
supergirl,I...I don't know. This is all so sudden.
supergirl,No.
ethan,You're not afraid are you?
supergirl,"Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand."
ethan,If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
supergirl,Well...I guess one is all right.
ethan,Terrific.
selena,What a touching scene!
supergirl,Who are you ?
selena,I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
supergirl,I don't scare that easily.
selena,"All right, Miss Know-it-all. If I can't have him, nobody can."
selena,"Coffer of Shadow, show your Power!"
supergirl,That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
ethan,Supergirl'?
selena,"Yookoohoo! No, that's not it. Sis-o-reb! Nope. Ka-ma-hoochie!"
bianca,Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
selena,"Shut up, and get me a hacksaw."
bianca,Why don't you use the Coffer of Shadow?
selena, I don't feel like it right now.
bianca,"She didn't take it from you, did she?"
selena,"That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools."
bianca,There's no need. I learned the Craft from my                         grandmother.
selena,Good. Now bring the car. We must call a meeting of the seven.
selena,There you are. Come to mama.
supergirl,I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
supergirl,But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
ethan,You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
ethan,"Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---"
supergirl,"Well, maybe a little longer than that."
selena,You're more afraid of the President than me???
selena,Let us begin. I invoke the rule of seven.
nigel,"You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena."
selena,We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
indian woman,But Superman has been away.
selena,"It is not Superman I speak of, but his cousin Kara. She knows we exist.."
elderly man,Then she must be destroyed.
elderly man,"That is unimportant. Now that she knows, she will become curious and learn more. When she learns we plan to restore the ancient religion of this planet and avenge the centuries of persecution---she will try to stop us."
bianca,We must destroy her first.
erica,But how can we destroy her?
selena,By the Rite of Ultimate Power. One person must volunteer  to take on the combined power of us all.
nigel,You! You want to take our power for yourself!
selena,"Nige1, you know the one who takes on Ultimate Power must sacrifice the last sparks of her own spirit."
selena, Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
nigel,You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
selena,"Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?"
nigel,Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
selena,Nonsense.
selena,I invoke the rule of seven. Do you agree?
nigel,I have no choice.
supergirl,"Ethan, what IS wrong?"
ethan,She said it wouldn't last.
supergirl,What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
ethan,I don't love you any more.
ethan,Like turning off a light.
ethan,"I feel awful. All that romantic garbage. All that mushy talk.  He lurches off into the undergrowth, toward the interior of the island. She plunges into the vegetation keeping pace with him.  SUPERGIRL Where are you going?"
supergirl,But why?
ethan,Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
supergirl,I sort of like what you said.
ethan,That makes it worse.
supergirl,But I don't understand.
ethan,"Of course you don't. We're from two different worlds, remember?"
selena,At last. Ultimate Power.
bianca,And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
selena,What do you mean we?
ethan,Hi.
supergirl,Hello. Are you still mad at me?
ethan,I'm not mad at you.
supergirl,It seemed that way to me.
ethan,I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
ethan,"What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song..."
supergirl,And now?
ethan,"And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike..."
supergirl,"Well...I don It know much about these things, but maybe if you had that feeling once...it can, come back."
ethan,But what if---it wasn't real?
supergirl,"Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever."
ethan,"Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think?"
supergirl,"Are you asking me for a ""date""?"
ethan,Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
supergirl,Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
ethan,She'll forget about us eventually.
supergirl, There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
ethan, I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
supergirl,That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
ethan,In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
supergirl,"I can see through walls. I could surprise her. The only thing I can't see through is lead, that's why I didn't see the Power Source at the amusement park."
ethan,Wait. Don't leave me.
supergirl,You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
supergirl,What?
supergirl,"And you can see how you feel about me, right?"
ethan,Yes.
supergirl,Ethan!
supergirl,Hey take it easy. I won't hurt you.
bianca,"I thought .it was her, coming back. Spared me. But I thought. . . maybe changed her mind. Nigel warned us. Wouldn't listen to him."
supergirl,What are you talking about? Where's Selena?
bianca,No. Don't want to know. She's bad. Don't go near her. Hurt you.
nigel,Supergirl! She's waiting for you. On Taliesen Mountain. Stop her before it's too late!
ethan,"I'm wise to your tricks, lady."
selena,I could force you.
ethan,"If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again."
selena,"Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten."
selena,You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
selena,"Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry."
selena,I told you I'd win.
selena,Kiss me.
supergirl,Ethan!
selena,"Enjoy your prison, Supergirl. It's forever."
supergirl,Ethan! Don't let her do this!
supergirl,No. No. It isn't true.
kara,Mother? I can hardly hear you.
kara,"I'm lost, Mother. In some awful place. I can't fly anymore. And I'm weak."
alura's voice,"Kara, you must not give up. We must retrieve the Power Source. The City is dying."
kara,Then send someone else. I failed.
alura's voice,We can't. The' dimension barrier is stronger. We no longer have the power to push through.
kara,"But Mother, I'm lost."
selena,Nations of the world! I bring you tidings of a new age!
selena,"I bring you a return to the ancient true worship of Nature, our Sovereign Queen and Mother. And I bring you myself as her representative here on Earth."
selena,"From this moment forth, all science, religion and other unnatural beliefs are forbidden. And in their place I will teach the One True Way of our ancient grandmothers."
president,You are talking about the end of Civilisation as we know it.
selena,And it's about time too.
president,"I do not know who you are, or what evil force you represent, but it will take more than a few threats from you to make mankind turn back the clock and abandon thousands of years of progress."
selena,Threats? I don't need threats to destroy civilisation. I have something better.
supergirl,Zaltar.
zaltar,Kara? Is it you?
zaltar,This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
zaltar,Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
supergirl,Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
supergirl,"...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone."
zaltar,It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
supergirl,I know.
zaltar,"Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people."
supergirl,Others?
zaltar,Criminals.
zaltar,A few hundred parasangs that way. I avoid them. And you should too.
supergirl,"Just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of Argo City..."
zaltar,Yes. Can't seem to get away from that style. Must try something new.
zaltar,"No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness."
supergirl,"Are you happy, Zaltar?"
zaltar,What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
supergirl,But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
zaltar,"I look at them all the time. Every planet in the galaxy. It's quite boring. Here, rub some of this onto that bruise."
supergirl,You look at them? How?
zaltar,The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
zaltar,There you see? What could be more boring than that?
supergirl,Wait. Could...could I see the place I just came from?
zaltar,It'll only make you sad.
zaltar,This goes closer. This moves it around. And this begins.
secretary,No more audiences today. Go home. All of you.
selena,They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
ethan,Yeah.
selena,Coming?
selena,"Smile, lunk-head. You're not a gardener any more, you're Prince Ethan now."
zaltar,Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
supergirl,No. I have to see this.
lucy,I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
jimmy,How do you know?
lucy,I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
lucy,I can't help it if men notice me.
jimmy,Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
jimmy,I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
lucy,I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
jimmy,I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.
ethan,Hmmm?
lucy,Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
lucy,"Right! Say, do you swing any weight around here?"
ethan,A little.
lucy,Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
ethan,I'll mention it upstairs.
jimmy,The blonde girl who saved your life---where is she now?
ethan,She's gone. No one will ever see her again.
zaltar,"Of course, my dear. What can I do?"
supergirl,Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
zaltar,There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
supergirl,"If there's a way in, there must be a way out."
zaltar,"No, that's not true---there's well...no--"
zaltar,But it's impossible.
supergirl,Why?
zaltar,"No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it."
zaltar,I could do it.
zaltar,"No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think."
zaltar,"Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question."
supergirl,Then come with me.
zaltar,Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
supergirl,You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
zaltar,"Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?"
supergirl,"Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die."
zaltar,"Oh, all right. Stop crying. Let's go."
supergirl,You're going to take me back?
zaltar,Going to try. Didn't say I could.
supergirl,"I heard my mother ask you once ""how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?"" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart."
zaltar,"Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!"
lucy,"Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs."
ethan,I did.
lucy," Well thanks a pile, fella."
ethan,I don't know. You seem afraid.
selena,"You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?"
ethan, Supergirl?
selena,Quit staring so hard. You'll strain your eyes.
ethan,"You're not going to hurt her, are you?"
selena,"You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?"
ethan,Well...I guess I can't.
selena,I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
selena,"Unless Supergirl agrees to go away forever, the serpents will drop them one by one."
ethan,Why the empty cage?
selena,"That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan."
ethan,What...?
selena,You don't get this far without paying...a certain price.
lucy,Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
jimmy,You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
jimmy,Why didn't you tell me?
lucy,You're supposed to guess.
supergirl,Why are you stopping?
zaltar,Stopping? Was I? Silly. One thing you musn't do.
zaltar,Oh dear!
zaltar,Good girl! That's the way!
zaltar,You can use the wand.
supergirl,Better than when I was a child.
zaltar,I remember you then. Cute thing you were. Like your mother.
zaltar,What's that? Never saw anything like that.
supergirl,Don't stop. Keep moving.
supergirl, It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
zaltar,Too late. Too late. Save yourself.
supergirl,Zaltar!
supergirl,"You're not going to win, Selena. I won't let you."
supergirl,"Zaltar, Zaltar. You never had a selfish heart."
supergirl,"Wherever you are, Zaltar, thank 'you."
supergirl,"You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over."
selena,The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
supergirl,It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
jimmy,"Hey, what gives?"
selena,"All right, Supergirl. The game's not over till the last card's dealt."
supergirl,"You've run out of things to throw, Selena."
selena,Not yet.
ethan,It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
supergirl,How do I fight it?
ethan,Turn it against her.
real selena,"Power of Shadow, kill her!!"
second selena,"You are my shadow, you must obey me."
ethan,I've got it! The Power Source!
real selena, No! Stop! Please!
second selena,Thank you. I'll take this back to Argo City.
ethan,"It is you, then, really?"
second selena,Well?
ethan,It's you all right.
second selena,I'll make it easy for you.
ethan,"I couldn't help what I did, before. She drugged me."
supergirl,I never doubted you for a moment.
real selena,Supergirl. Please! Help! I'm dying...
selena,I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
supergirl,For what?
selena,Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
supergirl,Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
ethan,No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
supergirl,I'll come back as soon as I can.
selena,"What about me? They'll make, hash out of me around here."
ethan,She's right. They'll string her up.
supergirl,Do you want to come to Argo City?
supergirl,It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
supergirl,Grab hold of this. It forms a force field for the journey through inner space.
supergirl,It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
selena,Will they be angry with me for stealing the Power Source?
supergirl,"They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead."
selena,"Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel."
