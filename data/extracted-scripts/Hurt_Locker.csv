Speaker,Dialogue
thompson,It's to the left.
sanborn,Going left.
thompson,Up a little.
sanborn,There?
thompson,Closer. I want to see the ojive.
thompson,Push it in.
sanborn,I can't get it inside.
thompson,Pretend it's your dick.
sanborn, I'm pretending it's your dick.
thompson,Let me try.
sanborn,Give me a second.
thompson,Give me a crack at it.
sanborn,Shit. Okay.
thompson,Hello mamma. See that?
sanborn,Looks like a one-five-five. 4
thompson,Yeah. That can do some damage.
sanborn,We're going to need a charge.
eldridge,"Figured four blocks. Hey with these four blocks and the ninety pounds, are we going to be far enough away?"
thompson,"The blast is going to roll out there , and most of the shrapnel is going to rain up in an umbrella pattern. Some smaller pieces and shell fragments will come out this way -- but we'll be okay if we are behind the truck."
eldridge,You know I'll be behind the truck.
thompson,"Nothing wrong with that, Owen. Let's get the area cleared--  --as best we can, then load up the bot. 5"
sanborn,Damn.
sanborn,"Matt, the bot's not going to do it."
thompson,Keep trying.
thompson,"Okay, you're right. I have to go down there - don't you think?"
thompson,I don't want to wait around here in this neighborhood anyway.
sanborn," What, you don't like it here?"
thompson,Let's just get me dressed.
thompson,Watch it.
sanborn," I thought you already had your children, Sergeant."
thompson,Need to keep my options open.
thompson,"Okay. I'm going to make my approach. This area looks okay. No power-lines. Clean line of sight. If it looks alright when I get down there, I'm going to plug it in and we'll just blow it. Boom -- no more bomb -- give these people something to think about.  7"
sanborn,Ready?
thompson,"I'm craving a hamburger, is that strange?"
sanborn,Not for you.  Happy trails.
thompson, This is Blaster One.
sanborn," Copy, that. Blaster One. You're good to go."
thompson, 200 meters. It's boiling in here.
sanborn, Copy that. 200 meters.
sanborn," Copy, that. 100 meters out."
thompson, Twenty five.
sanborn,Copy twenty five. You're in the kill zone.
thompson, Thanks for reminding me.
thompson, Alright. I'm here. I'm gonna put it in.
sanborn, Copy that.
sanborn, Hold on. Bird coming in.
thompson, I hear it.
thompson, Guy is trying to kill me.
thompson," If he brings that electricity back here, I'm going to put a bullet in his tail."
sanborn,"Jesus.  I think he figured out we were EOD. You're good, Blaster One."
thompson," We're armed and ready to blow, Blaster Mike."
sanborn, Copy that. You coming back?
thompson," Copy that, I'm on my way."
eldridge,Hey Sanborn --
sanborn, Yeah?
eldridge,Butcher shop - dude has a phone.
sanborn,He shouldn't be --
eldridge, Hey - put that down--
thompson, 50 meters. Why is Eldridge running?
eldridge,Hey - put the phone down!
eldridge,DROP THE PHONE!!!
james,Yeah. 14
james,It's open.
sanborn,Sergeant James.  J.T. Sanborn. Welcome to Bravo Company and welcome to Camp Victory.
james,Victory? I thought this was called Camp Liberty.
sanborn, They changed it last week. Victory sounds better.
james,It's Will. Good to meet you J.T.
sanborn,"So, is that all you brought from Kabul?"
james,"Yeah. Here, give me a hand with this."
james,By the window. 15
james,"A mortar once hit near my trailer -- boom -- a two inch piece of frag cut through the aluminum and flew this far  over my head, past my balls and landed in my computer hard-drive. Where's the damn light?"
sanborn,This should stop any lateral pieces.
james,"Yeah, I'm good unless it comes through the roof  in which case I'm gonna need a closed casket."
sanborn,The accent -- you from Georgia?
sanborn,"Oh, right. I'm from Vermont. You know, ""live free or die."" Trees. Snow. Maple syrup. Pot."
sanborn,"Well, if you need anything to get squared away, just let me know. Either myself or Owen -- Eldridge -- be happy to steer you in the right direction for supplies, whatever."
james,Okay.  Thanks. 16
sanborn,"Anyway, the mess tent can be hard to find the first time ... so ... if you want ... we're going over there now to grab chow ... come along."
james,Thanks. But no.
sanborn,You want me to bring you back a burger or something?
james, Nah. I'm good.
james,"I'm sorry about Thompson, I heard he was a good tech."
sanborn,"Yeah, he was. And he was a good team leader too."
james,"I know I can't fill his shoes, but I'm here to try--"
sanborn,Appreciate it.
james,"--but you know, if it's your time it's your time. No man can change that."
sanborn," So, we roll at oh-six-hundred."
james,Looking forward to it. 17
eldridge,So?
sanborn,"A good `ole boy. You know, loves the Army, blood runs green. Country boy. Seems solid."
eldridge,"I always liked southerners, for some reason."
sanborn,Then he's just your type.
eldridge,Why is it always the gay jokes with you. It's not even funny.
sanborn, It's your time it's your time.
eldridge, He said that?
eldridge,Where's the FNG?
eldridge,It's oh-six-hundred.
james,Gimme a minute.
eldridge," Those Abrams have been parked ever since I got here nine months ago, and I ain't seen them move once. They should put those on eBay. Hey, J.T., how much you think one of those would cost?"
sanborn,Ten million?
eldridge,"Well I guess it makes sense. Anybody comes alongside the Humvee, we're dead. Anybody looks at you funny, you're dead. Pretty much, the bottom line, is if you're in Iraq you're dead. How's a tank going to stop that?"
sanborn,"Gimme a break, Owen."
eldridge, Sorry. Just trying to scare the new guy.
james,We had a few bombs up in Kabul too.
eldridge,"Sure, I bet you did. But you're going to be real busy here, boss."
sanborn,Hey Owen -- watch the fucking road.
eldridge,Imshee -- Imshee !
sanborn, Clear here.
eldridge,Clear here.
james, Where are the guys who called this in?
sanborn," Victory Main, Victory Main, this is Blaster Mike. Interogative, Do you have an updated poz for the link- up? Has their position changed?"
sanborn," Negative, Main. No one in sight."
sanborn," Well, that's were I am and I don't see any guys in fatigues, and I sure as hell don't see any American flag, Over."
eldridge,They abandoned their vehicle?
james,Hello boys --
sanborn," Yeah, thanks. Roger that."
james, Don't tell me the bomb is in there with you.
sergeant," Down on that block, one of our informants says there is an IED in a white plastic bag."
james,I'll get it.  Keep your guys back.
sanborn,What about the bot?
james,Don't need it. 23
sanborn, What? Aren't we going to send the bot down to take a look?
james,"Nah, I'm going to take care of it."
sanborn,I was thinking if we sent the bot down first --
eldridge,He's a rowdy boy.
sanborn,He's reckless.
eldridge,"Somebody should tell the U.N. to send the rice in clear plastic bags so there's no place to hide the IEDs. The insurgent would be like, `Allah has forsaken me all the bags are clear'."
sanborn, I've seen so much garbage I'm starting to like the smell.
james,24
sanborn," Blaster One, what are you doing?"
sanborn," Blaster One, this is Blaster Mike, what's with the fire on the side of the road, over?"
sanborn," Hey James, can you hear me? What's with the fire on the side of the road, over?"
james, Creating a diversion.
sanborn, From what? Is there a threat?
sanborn, Get up on that wall.
sanborn," James, I can't see you, over."
sanborn," Tell me what you see, Specialist."
eldridge,"I see his back. He's walking downrange. Oh, I lost him."
sanborn,"Eldridge, move down that wall and maintain a visual. Move. Move."
eldridge,"Roger, roger. I'm on him. He's still walking."
sanborn," James, the smoke is killing my visibility. Where are you in relation to the IED? Are you 100 meters, yet? 26"
james," Hell, I don't know. I'll let you know when I'm standing over it."
sanborn, JAMES --
eldridge, Car! Car! A car stopped in front of him.
james, I got it.
soldier, EOD has a nine on this Haji in the car. I'm going to get two guys over there to back him up.
sanborn, Stand down. EOD has the situation under control.
eldridge, We're in a kill zone!
soldier, Three or four rounds fired. The nine is now pressing into the Haji's forehead.
james, If he wasn't an insurgent he sure as hell is now.
sanborn, 29
james, We're done.
james, Secondary!
sanborn, Get behind something. Find cover.
james,30
james," Man, I need a beer."
sanborn,We can arrange that.
sanborn,What do you like?
james,Colt.
sanborn,Nice southern brand.
eldridge,I'd take a beer.
james," Hey, that wasn't too bad, for our first time working together."
sanborn,I think working together is I talk to you. And you talk to me.
james,"Are we going on a date, J.T.?"
sanborn,"No, we're going on a mission. And it's my job to keep you safe, so we can keep going on missions."
james,"Hey, this is combat."
eldridge,It's just thirty nine days.
sanborn,Thirty eight. Assuming we survive today.
eldridge,Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
james,I don't mean to mix it up. But the situation dictated it.
sanborn, Roger that.
james,I'm serious. We're gonna work together. You'll get used to my ops tempo.
sanborn,Your ops tempo?
james,"I don't always stop to chat, and I like to go fast. You know, so the insurgents don't have time to plan. I don't want them make any cell phone calls."
sanborn,Ketchup?
eldridge,"This is not Pizza Hut.  And this is not pepperoni. It's round and meaty, but it ain't pepperoni."
sanborn,"Goat meat, probably."
eldridge,Goat meat pepperoni? I'd be glad if this was goat meat pepperoni.  33
sanborn,"Pray for something better -- and while you're at it, pray for a new team leader."
eldridge,You sure you want to be the guy in the bomb suit?
sanborn,Be better than him.
eldridge,"Hey, James."
eldridge, That was some crazy shit you pulled out there.
james,Yeah?
eldridge,Hell yeah. You're either really lucky or really good. Right up on the car like that. Gun to the head. Crazy. You know it might backfire on you someday. You know that. You might actually die. And then what?
james,"I don't know, what?"
eldridge,You don't meet your maker. You just get vaporized into little bits of DNA. 34
sanborn, He asks everyone what they think about death. Ever since Thompson was KIA.
james,I don't think about it. Waste of time.
pele,"One for five, two for nine."
james, Three for twelve?
pele,"Three for thirteen. And for you, no tax."
james, Keep the change.
first sergeant,The tags finally came. Figured you'd want to be the one to take them over.
sanborn,"Thanks, I will handle it."
eldridge," ""Be all that you can be,"" right? But what if all I can be is dead on the side of an Iraqi road?"
eldridge," Why? I think it's logical. This is a war, right Doc? People die all the time. Why not me?"
eldridge,What do you think about?
james,"...really beautiful night, wish you could see these stars...miss you...bye..."
sanborn,Hey.
james,Hey.
sanborn,I gotta talk to you about something before we roll out.
james,Shoot. 37
sanborn,Yesterday -- that was not cool.
james,I know. We'll get it.
sanborn,I was in Military Intel for seven years. Before EOD. We ran combat missions in every shit hole on the PLANET  So I'm pretty sure I can figure out a dumb trailer park redneck like you.
james, Looks like you're on the right track.
sergeant,"An office worker called it in. The car doesn't belong to anyone who works at the building. It's been parked there for an hour. No license plate and the suspension is sagging, so there's something heavy in the trunk -- three or four hundred pounds. Could be a bomb."
james,Did you evacuate?
sergeant,We're trying. But the English Ambassador said we're supposed to guarantee his safety.
sanborn,Bot is ready.
soldier 1, Shit -- What do you want me to do?
soldier 2,Shoot her.
soldier 1,We can't shoot her for riding a bike...
james,"Eldridge - I want you in that window - keep the alley clear. Sanborn, cover it from the street."
ambassador geddes,...So in sixteen months time I believe five million gallons per day is in fact rather conservative.
executive,But security is still the big variable?
ambassador geddes,"Only on the margins.  Everyday, the risks diminish and the rewards multiply--"
ambassador geddes,"Ah, and here is EOD. You see gentlemen, everything is fine. The site is secure. The bomb -- if there even is one -- will easily be dispensed by the crack American team."
eldridge,Excuse me.
eldridge," Blaster Mike, I'm at the window."
sanborn, Copy that. How's the fire look from up there.
eldridge," Flames a meter high, over."
sanborn," Blaster One, what is going on?"
eldridge, What's happening?
sanborn, Good question. But I'm not liking it.
james, We're all in the kill zone on this one.
eldridge," Sir, I'm going to need you to stay away from the window."
ambassador geddes,"Yes, please, sit down. It's safe."
executive,"Why is he here, if it's safe?"
ambassador geddes,He is just an observer.
executive," Is that true, we're safe here?"
eldridge," In my opinion, no."
ambassador geddes,This is idiotic. Why not tow the vehicle away from the building?
eldridge,"I believe the lane is too narrow for a Humvee, Sir. 43"
ambassador geddes,Donkeys.   Use donkeys.
eldridge,"I don't believe we have any of those on hand, Sir."
ambassador geddes,"Jesus, Lord. You Americans really are incompetent. No donkeys on hand? What do you think I'm talking about, a full squadron of farm animals?"
eldridge,SIR--
ambassador geddes," Go downstairs, grab a farmer or one of those street vendors and procure - meaning purchase, buy - several donkeys. Then tow this car bomb away from my office."
eldridge," Sir, I'm going to need you to step away from the window."
sanborn, Where's the switch?
james, Not in the back seat. 44
james cont'd, Not in the front seat. Doors. Dash.
james, None of the cord goes under. It's up here -- somewhere.
sanborn, It's been thirty seconds. You need to bail.
james, Roger that. Be right out.
bicyclist, Where is the entrance to this building?
sanborn,Imshee! Imshee!
eldridge, I'm going to burn him on three. One.
ambassador geddes,"Oh, that's rich. Give him a count."
eldridge, Please don't make me kill you.
ambassador geddes,Been in combat very long? 46
sanborn," James, you need to get out. There's another potential bomber here."
james, So shoot him.
bicyclist, I need to make a delivery down there. Please let me through.
sanborn, Get the fuck out of here!
sanborn," Blaster One, do you copy, over? 47"
james, Gimmie a minute.
ambassador geddes,Well done.     That took great self control.
eldridge,"Thank you, sir. Again, I apologize for the intrusion into --"
ambassador geddes,"Yes, but I doubt the insurgents will appreciate your restraint.  If I may give you a piece of free advice, next time, pull the trigger."
eldridge,"Well, actually, the uh--rules --"
ambassador geddes,"That's the only way out, I'm afraid. When you're in a losing battle, you have to draw blood. No insurgency in modern history has ever been truly defeated, so all you can do is manage your exit. Clear a wide swath of bodies so you have room to withdraw."
aide,"The building is empty, Sir, except for you. 48"
ambassador geddes,"I'm sorry to say it, but that's just how it's done. You need to show some vigor. In Kenya, we executed the insurgents in their beds, until they gave us room. Falklands, the same. That's just how it's done."
eldridge,Is that how you did it in Northern Ireland? With murder?
ambassador geddes, There you are. Now you're showing some vigor.
eldridge," J.T, the building is clear now. We can pull out."
sanborn, James?
sanborn," Blaster One, we are cleared to leave this fucking site. Walk away. Do you copy, over? 49"
james," Stay where you are, Sanborn. I'm not done."
eldridge," J.T., are we moving?"
sanborn, Negative. Negative.
sanborn," Goddamn, Will, I need a report."
james,Got it.
sanborn,Take the suit.
sanborn,"Hey, James."
james,Yeah?
sanborn,Don't you turn off your walkie again.
colonel reed,Hi boys.
james," Hello, sir."
colonel reed, That you in the bomb suit?
james,"Yes, sir, it was."
colonel reed," You were the guy in the flaming car, Sergeant James?"
james,"Yes, sir."
colonel reed,"Well hot damn, that was some hot shit. You're a wild man, you know that?"
colonel reed,"He's a wild man, you know that?  Let me shake your hand."
james,"Thank you, sir."
colonel reed,"How many bombs have you disarmed, Sergeant?"
james,"Hell, I'm not sure.    A lot."
colonel reed,"Sergeant, I asked you a question."
james,"One seven three.   Counting today, Sir."
colonel reed,"Holy shit. One hundred and seventy fucking three bombs. God damn. That must be a record. So tell me, what's the best way to go about disarming one of these things?"
james,The way you don't die.
colonel reed, I'd like a picture with this man - anybody here have a camera?
james,"Thanks, sir, thank you very much. Sir, couldn't do it without my team  Hey, Sanborn! Get over here!"
james, And Specialist Eldridge.
colonel reed,You guys should all get Bronze stars and I'm gonna recommend it. 53
sanborn,"Thanks, Sir."
colonel reed,"Good luck, boys. Keep on keeping on."
colonel reed,"You wouldn't catch me walking down on no fuckin' bomb. Hell no, you're not gonna get me in that monkey suit."
eldridge,Bronze star?
sanborn,"I don't care,  the guy is not safe. You can have mine and I'll pin it on your coffin."
eldridge,So you do think I'm going to die.
sanborn,"Fuck, Owen. I don't know. Probably not."
cut to:,54
pele, Ball! Ball!
pele,Give it.
james,Give me my five bucks and I'll give you your ball.
pele,Five dollars - for what?
james,Those DVDs were crap. They were so fuzzy I couldn't see a thing.
pele,"No, impossible."
james,"I'm telling you, they were fuzzy."
pele,"That's Hollywood, my man. Special effects."
james,What's your name anyway?
pele,Pele. 55
james,Oh yeah - like the soccer player?
pele,"Yes, the great Pele"
james,"Ready? One, two --"
james,-- three. Shit.
pele," So you are EOD -- boomala boomala. It's fun, no?"
james,"I like to disarm them. Tell   you what, kid, I'll buy another   DVD from you but if this one is   fuzzy you better watch out. Cause   I'm coming for you."
eldridge, What if I should be pulling the trigger more often? Killing people? Bomb makers.
eldridge,But what if I need to change the mission - to survive? That bicyclist I told you about? I'm ninety percent sure he was an insurgent. I could have shot him. Not my mission. But it would have been legal.
eldridge,You don't?
eldridge,And you know this from your extensive work in the field.
eldridge,Where was that? Yale?
eldridge,"Keep the soldier in the fight and the fight in the soldier, right Doc?"
eldridge,"Seriously, I appreciate what you're saying. But you need to get out from behind this desk more."
sanborn,Hey.
james,Hey.
james, If you ever get in my shoes and put on the bomb suit you'll see your whole mind changes when you're in front of a bomb. You lose 20 IQ points just from the weight of the suit. Your brain gets so much adrenaline that you hallucinate. Turn off the walkie?
james,You'll be lucky if all you do is turn off the walkie.
james,How are we on water? I'm dying.
eldridge,J.T.'s got some.
james, Water?
sanborn,No. I'm all out.
sanborn,Fire in the hole. Fire in the hole
james,Hold on a second. I think I forgot my gloves back there. 59
eldridge,Those detonators break all the time. Accidental misfire.
sanborn,"With that shot laid out like that, it could be a UXO that just cooks off."
eldridge,Boom.
sanborn,Boom.
eldridge,A shot that size would obliterate everything in its path.
sanborn,"His helmet, you'd have that."
eldridge,"Oh yeah, there'd be half a helmet somewhere."
sanborn,And little bits of hair stuck to it.
eldridge,Little bits of hair.
sanborn,We'd have to recommend a major change in techniques and protocols so that kind of accident never happens again. You'd write the first draft of the report.
eldridge,Are you serious? 60
sanborn,I'm not going to write it.
eldridge,"No, are you serious about killing him?"
sanborn, James? Do you copy? James?
james, It's empty.
sanborn," Rock it out, slowly."
james," Sanborn, watch that chain."
sanborn,It's alright.
eldridge, What am I shooting at? 62
sanborn, I don't fucking know! -- but James is down!!!
sergeant, Get up there with your Barret and help him out.
sniper, I don't see nothing out there. Chris is shooting wild.
sergeant, Hey Chris - can you hear me? Chill out on the fifty man.
soldier, Copy that.
sniper,Holy shit. He killed Chris.
james,We should save our ammo at least until we can see these bastards. 64
sergeant, Do you see anything.
sniper,It's got to be coming from those buildings. Somebody moved on the roof of the tall one there.
sergeant,Hit him if you see him again.
sergeant,Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Jesus.
sergeant, We are taking incoming fire. I have two KIA. The grid --
sergeant, Don't do that fellas.
james,"Eldridge, I need ammo."
james, You're shooting high.
james, Eldridge clean the bullets. The blood is making them jam.
james,Spit on `em Eldridge. Spit. Rub. Spit rub. 66
james,"Come on, Eldridge. I need ammo."
james,"You're doing good, man. . You're okay."
james,"I will keep you safe, Owen, that's my job."
eldridge,Roger.
james, Alright. Scan your sectors.
james," Still high, adjust your windage. Elevation."
sanborn,Got it.
james,He's on the left by the smoke stack. Guy in white.
james,Good. There's another one just behind him. Up a meter.
james,Good.
james,"Eldridge, grab me the juice out of an MRE. 68"
eldridge,"Uh, Will."
james,Yeah.
eldridge,At my one o'clock. Two hundred meters. Something moved behind a parked car. Either a tan dog or a man in a light-colored shirt.
james,Deal with it.
eldridge,Uh--Ok.
eldridge,I don't think it's a dog.   Should I fire?
james,It's your call.
soldier,"Good hit, man."
soldier,I'm going to go for the Humvee. What do you say?
sergeant,I don't know.
soldier,We've been here two hours and they ain't seen nothing. I'm going to go for it.
soldier, Those fuckers are dead.
sergeant,What if they hit us with an RPG when we get out? What if they were just waiting for us to get in the Humvee. 70
soldier,It's safe. I'm telling you  You got those fuckers.
soldier, We got you mother fuckers. You're fucking dead Hajis. Haha.
soldier,Kiss this mother fucker!!!
james,Ready?
james,Now we're even.
sanborn,Be right back. I gotta piss.
james,"One more, boy."
eldridge," Yes, Sir, Sergeant James Sir. You're not very good drunk are you SIR!! You're a good fighter, Sir. Natural born warrior, Sir."
james, You acquitted yourself well on the field of battle today.
eldridge,Really? I got scared.
james,Everyone is a coward at some point in their lives.
sanborn,"Hey Owen, look! Will has possessions! I didn't know you owned anything, Will."
james,That's my son. A real tough little bastard. Like me.
sanborn,So you're married?
james,"Well, she was my girlfriend, we had a baby, then she became my wife, then we got divorced.  72"
sanborn,"Dumb, to be with you?"
james,She ain't dumb. She's loyal.
sanborn,My problem is the one girl who I like keeps talking about kids. Kids. Kids.
james," Give her your sperm, stud."
sanborn,Nah. I'm not ready.  And what's this?
james,Bomb parts.
sanborn,No shit. Why do you have them?
james,This is from the Blue Opal. 
eldridge,What's this one from?
james," That was one of our early roadside bombs we disarmed, the one with -- 73"
sanborn, --it's a piece of junk from Radio Shack.
eldridge,IT'S INTERESTING
james,I agree.
sanborn," The only reason he likes you is because you act like his bitch, and you look up to him, and he likes to be the top dog."
james,I agree with that too.
eldridge,"Oh no, . Good-bye world."
sanborn,That punch was harder than I hit you. I'm owed a good one.
james,Alright.
eldridge,"Hold on, we need some rules. No face shots."
james,"Beauty mark, my mother dropped me at birth."
eldridge,Looks like frag scars.
james,Ahhhh! Excellent. Now your turn.
james, Looks like it hurt.
james,There there. It'll be okay.
sanborn,Get off of me you freak.
james,"Oh yeah, ride me, ride me."
james,"You're alright, Sanborn. Let's have another."
james,I got him.
eldridge,Later.
james,Okay. Here we go big boy.
sanborn,Do you think I have what it takes to get in the bomb suit?
james,Sure.
james," I'm doing fine, babe. How are you?"
james,Great. I'll call you tomorrow when you're awake.
james," Yeah, me too."
james,Sure. Bye honey. 77
soldier,What can I do for you?
sanborn,I have something?
soldier,Remains?
sanborn,No.
soldier,Personal effects? 78
sanborn,Yeah.
soldier,What's the name?
sanborn,"Thompson, Matt. Sergeant EOD. Baker Company."
soldier, third aisle down the hall.
soldier,I'll walk you over there.
soldier,Here you go. Did you know him?
sanborn,"Yeah, I did. He was my team leader."
soldier,"Oh, I'm sorry brother."
sanborn,Thank you. Thank you.
eldridge,Tough night.
james,"Hell, yeah."
james,Aren't you supposed to be at your shrink?
eldridge,"I fired him. I said, Doc, shooting a man had a salubrious effect on me."
james,What the hell does that mean?
eldridge,Healthy.
james,"You're healthy? Well, why not."
sanborn,What's up team? 80
sanborn,Can I get a Huu-haa?
james,I'm going back to sleep now.
eldridge,Let's roll.
team leader," It was a car bomb. Fucking nasty one -- they had a decoy detonator set up so that when I disarmed it nothing happened -- then, I'm walking back uprange to get some more tools and boooom!!! If I hadn't been wearing the suit, I'd be dead right now."
eldridge,Get a Medic to look at your cheek.
team leader, Be careful. They're starting to hide the detonator really well.
first sergeant,"Sorry to ruin your day off, but your team is up."
james,Yeah.
james,"Anytime, Sir. It's a privilege."
james,"Don't mean to insult your intelligence, Sir. But if the shit hits the fan, please don't fire out of these windows. They're bullet proof and the round will just bounce around the cabin."
soldier 1, Right up those stairs.
james,You been inside already?
soldier 1,In there? Fuck no. We've had reports of all kinds of shit coming out of that house -- and--
james,AND WHAT--
soldier 1,--bodies.
james,Why don't you wait here? We'll bring out anything of interest.
sanborn,This would be a great place to put a pressure activator.
james,"Yeah, with like twenty pounds of high explosives on it so you get anyone in the room when you open the door."
eldridge,Rope trick?
james,Guess no one's home.
james," Sorry, one of ours, just a flash grenade."
james,The kid at camp.
sanborn,What?
james,He sells DVDs.
sanborn,"No, that's not him."
james,You see him every day. He sells DVDs by the mess tent. His name is Pele.
sanborn,Different kid.
eldridge,This is sick.
sanborn,You seen a body bomb before?
james,Don't touch it. Let's blow it.
james," Copy that, How long?"
james, Can you -- you need to explain to them that we don't have 15 minutes.
james, Fifteen is not going to work. I need to do this now.
james, Tell command I'm in a fucking war zone. And I'm going to blow now.
james, Cancel that det.
james," This is Blaster One, I'm coming down."
eldridge,...So you really don't think it was the DVD kid?
sanborn,"No, I don't."
eldridge,You're positive?
sanborn,Yeah. Could it be? One in a million chance.
eldridge,I don't know. Will seemed positive. But that was weird.
sanborn,Very weird.
cambridge,This is not a safe area for you. Imshee!
iraqi man, Why do you talk to us like children. We are not children.
cambridge,"Gimme a break, will you?"
iraqi man,Why should I? 89
eldridge,But then Will's pretty weird. He keeps bomb parts under his bed.
sanborn,I bet you he doesn't put this one under his bed.
james,Our ride is here.
james,We're movin'.
james,Hey - you haven't seen that kid around here by any chance - who sells movies?
dvd man,Sorry. No English.
james,No English? Don't lie to me. Where's that kid?
dvd man,"Sorry, my man. Movie? Five dollars."
james,Are you guys responsible for this area?
guard,What's up?
james,"That motherfucker over there  could be an insurgent, watching the camp and giving intel to his buddies so they know where to launch their mortars."
guard,I think he's just a guy selling DVDs. 92
james,He's a security risk. You should get rid of him.
guard,The merchants are cleared. I couldn't do anything to him without the say-so from my CO.
james,Does this change anything?
james,OGA.
guard,"Are you cleared to leave the camp through this gate, Sir?"
guard,I'm going to need to see your ID again.
james,"Don't fuck with me man, I'm having a bad day already. 93"
dvd man,Pele.
james,Wait here.
james,Do you speak English?
kalim,"English, French, Arabic."
james, I want the people responsible for Pele.
kalim,For whom?
james,Pele. The body bomb.
kalim,"Pele? I don't know. But please sit down. I am professor Kalim, this is my home. You are a guest. Sit."
james,Take me to the people responsible.
kalim,"Of course, whatever you seek, I will help you find. Please, please sit, down. You are CIA, no? I am very pleased to have CIA in my home."
james,Maybe you don't understand?
kalim,"Please, be careful. Be slow. A gun can go off."
guards,"On your knees, on your knees!!"
guard,What're you doing?
james," Ficke, ficke."
guard,Yeah?
james,Whorehouse two clicks from here.
guard,"If I let you in, will you tell me where it is exactly?"
sanborn," I repeat, do you copy? Do you copy?"
james," Yeah, I'm right here. What's up?"
sanborn, 97
james, Copy that. What's you're twenty.
sanborn," We're at the south gate, James. We've been waiting for you for half an hour. Where have you been? Over."
sanborn,A tanker blew up near the Green Zone about an hour ago. We're doing a post-blast on it. To figure out how the suicide bomber pulled it off. So where did you say you were again?
james,I didn't. Sergeant. Let's go.
eldridge,What happened to your head.
james,"Watch the road, Owen."
james,"Sanborn, get the big spotlights."
sanborn,"Friendlies, coming `in."
soldier,You guys the Medics?
james,"No, we're EOD."
sanborn,Hey.
sanborn,"That's an engine block. A big one, too. From a truck probably."
james,Oil tanker?
sanborn,It's what I'm thinking.
sanborn,Stop! Wagef! Wagef!
face,He's with me.
colonel reed,Okay fellas?
james,"Sorry, Sir. I didn't recognize you."
colonel reed,We haven't found a body so it could be a suicide bomber or some clever bastard that caused all this -- and slipped away to sip tea with his mommie -- we just don't know.
james,"We'll take a close look, Sir. 100"
colonel reed,This kind of situation we may never know what happened. This is a mass casualty situation - terrible destruction.
james,"Roger that, Sir. We'll do our best."
colonel reed,"They're cowards, you know. I wish they would stand up and fight us, man to man, instead of playing hide and seek with me."
james,"Roger, Sir. We better get moving."
colonel reed,"Right, go ahead Sergeant."
sanborn,It's hair.
james,Hey! Hey -- you alright? -- Keef Halek?
eldridge, James?! 102
james,"Hey, I'm right here."
james,This is where the blast stopped.  Look over there.
james,Perfect vantage point for a remote det -- and I bet he's out there right now watching us make fools of ourselves. We could get him.
eldridge,You want to go out there?
james,"Yeah, let's go hunting."
eldridge,I could stand to get in some trouble.
sanborn,No.
james,No?
sanborn,"Man, this is bullshit. You got -- what?-- three infantry platoons here. That's their job."
james, 103
james,You got to work on your pull ups.
james,That little bastard. Let's torch this spot so he can't use it again.
james,Do you have an incendiary?
sanborn,No.
james,Eldridge!!!
sanborn,He's gone.
james,This guy comes out of the dark - Eldridge shoots.
sanborn,"Three shots, close range. He takes a step forward to see what he's hit. 105"
james,Another guy comes from behind him -- gets the drop on him. You're a hostage.
sanborn,"That way is towards the tanker, troops."
james,Hit `em with both lights on three.
sanborn,Fuck. Okay.
james,One. Two.
james,Three.
james,Again. One two three. Do it. Do it.
eldridge,Am I dead?
james,No. You're fine.
eldridge,Am I dead? Am I dead? Am I dead?
sanborn,So how you doing with this?
james,Fine. I'm fine.
sanborn,Fine? You know I lied to our sergeant.  107
james,Yeah. Thanks. I'm just tired.
sanborn,You want some sleeping pills?
james,"Nah, I'm good."
pele,"Hey, Boomala, Boomala!"
pele,HEY--
pele," Look at these, best quality.    No special effects!"
james,You'll probably be walking in a few months. 108
eldridge,My tibia is shattered in nine places I don't think I'm going to be walking soon. The doc said six months if I'm lucky.
james,Wow. Six ain't bad.
eldridge,Not bad? It fucking sucks man.
eldridge, You see that motherfucker. That's what happens when you shoot somebody.
james,I'm sorry.
eldridge,"You're sorry? Fuck you, Will.  Really fuck you. Thanks for saving my life and all but we didn't have to go hunting for the trigger man. You invented it, to get your adrenaline fix. You war mongering fuck."
sanborn," Take care of yourself, Owen."
james, I hear ticking.
james," Hey, Sanborn."
sanborn, Copy. What's up?
james," Send your skivvies down here on the bot, I'll run a quick bleach cycle. Somebody threw out a perfectly good washing machine."
sanborn, Copy that.
sanborn," Hustle back, something's going on."
james,What's going on?
nervous soldier,We've got a situation with a suicide bomber. 111
james,We'll follow you.
sergeant,Keep that translator back.
translator, But the bomb was forced on him. Against his will. He is not a bad man!
sergeant,"He came walking up to our checkpoint, said he had a bomb strapped to him. He was sorry. He didn't want it to blow up. He begged us to take it off him."
translator, Help this man. He's not a bad man. 112
sanborn,Not a bad man? You've got to be kidding me.  This is a trap. He wants to draw people close to him.
james, Tell him to open his jacket. I need to see the bomb.
james, Tell him to get on his knees.
sergeant,Can we just shoot him?
translator,NO. He's not a bad man. He has a family. The bomb was forced on him. He is asking for help. Only help.
james," I want you one hundred meters away, like everybody else."
translator,But how will I hear?
james,You don't need to. I'm going down there.
james, What the fuck is he shouting now? 113
translator,He's asking you to hurry. He thinks the bomb has a timer on it.
james,Where's that helmet?
sanborn,We've had our differences. Eldridge? That's water under the bridge. It happened. But this -- this is suicide.
james,That's why it's called a suicide bomb.
sanborn,"It's suicide for you, Will."
james,Nah. That guy wants to catch an American? I'll give him an American.
black suit,Inshalla. Inshalla.
james,Uh-huh. 114
james,"If I shoot you now, I can disarm this bomb much more easily. Do you understand?"
james," Sanborn, give your walkie to the translator."
translator, Yes?
james, What the hell is this guy saying?
translator," He says, I don't wish to die. I have a family. Please take this off me."
james, Hands have to stay behind his head or I will be very happy to shoot him.
translator," He says, please hurry he has a family."
james, That's not what I asked you. Now I'm going to shoot if he doesn't understand that he can't move his hands.
black suit,Yes. Yes. Yes!
james," Sanborn, I need to get this rig off. There's too many wires here to figure it out."
sanborn," Copy that, what do you need?"
james, Bolt cutters.
sanborn, Copy that. I'll get `em. 116
james, You've got two minutes to get them and get down here.
sanborn, Fuck. Copy that.
james, Don't move.
sanborn,Holy shit. You weren't kidding.
james,Nope.
james, What is this made out of?
black suit,Please. Please.
sanborn,Case hardened steel.
james,Motherfucker. What's our time?
sanborn,Three minutes.
james,Shit. Ok. Let me think.
james,We'd need an arc welder to get this off properly. 118
sanborn,I don't think we have one of those in the truck.
james,Let's try the back of it.
sanborn,We have to bail.
james,Go. I got the suit.
sanborn,What do you want me to do with the pistol?
james,"Take it with you, that's a good pistol."
sanborn,When do you leave?
james,In forty five seconds.
sanborn, Get back! Get back!
james,I'm sorry.
black suit,"Please, please."
james,The metal is too thick.
black suit,Help me. Help me!
black suit,No! No!
james,Sorry.
james,You alright?
sanborn,No.   I hate this place
james,Have a hit.
sanborn,"I'm not ready to die, man."
james,"Bro, you're not going to die out here."
sanborn,Another inch or two difference. Shrapnel goes zing  I don't even have a son.
james,You got time.
sanborn,"No... I'm done. I want a son, Will. I want a son."
sanborn,Why do you do it? Take the risks?
james,"Hell, I don't know."
sanborn,"But you know what I'm talking about, right? Every time we go out, you throw the dice. Live or die, you just throw `em down. You recognize that, right? 122"
james,Yeah.  I do. But I don't know why. Do you know why I am the way I am?
sanborn,"No, Will, I don't."
james,This traffic is pissing me off.
sanborn,"Where are we, anyway?"
james,I know where I am but I'm lost.
young woman,"Honey, you grab the barbecue sauce and I'll meet you in aisle four."
connie,"Let's put the chicken on first and the vegetables on last, so they don't burn?"
connie cont'd,Will?
james,"Yeah, okay.  You know, they're really short on bomb techs over there."
connie,"Well, good thing the army is hiring, and they've got so many great guys over there."
james,Uh-huh.
connie,Thanks for coming. Maybe he'll listen to you.
sanborn,I know how to talk to him.
sanborn,"What the fuck is the matter with you? You got a family, kid, nice looking burgers."
james,"I know, it's crazy. So how's life at home treating you?"
sanborn,I made the plunge.  But I thought we were talking about you.
james,"We just did, buddy."
james," Well, let's see. I bet you don't know the story of these magic boxes."
james,"Once upon a time, in a distant kingdom, there were many magic BOXES"
james,Every person had a magic box. But you couldn't tell they were magic boxes on the outside. Like this one.
james,"It just looks like a plain old box. Then a new king came along and told all the people, you have to give me all your magic boxes. But the people, instead of giving away their boxes decided to hide them. And they put their boxes in secret places all over the kingdom. They put them in the roads. They put them in cars. They put them in buildings. And the King said,  ""Well, how am I going to get my magic boxes now?"" And one of the King's men said, ""We have a special Knight with special armor, and he can find the boxes. And only he."
james,"And this Knight gathered up all the boxes, far and wide. And sometimes - - when he wasn't sure if it was a magic box -- he opened them."
james,"And the King said to the Knight, you have done a wonderful job. I will grant you one wish. What do you wish?"
james,But the Knight didn't know what to say.
james,"You see, the thing is, son. One day you'll understand that when you start out like you are now, you love everything. You love your Mommy and your Daddy. You love your bobba. You love your blanket.  127"
james,"With me, I think's it's one."
james,"You lost again, Sergeant?"
sanborn,"Get in, before I change my mind."
sanborn, Couldn't risk letting you on a public bus. Probably shoot the damn driver if it wasn't moving fast enough. 128
stewardess,"Here you are, Sir  Thank you for your service."
james,"Your welcome, m'am."
soldier,Welcome to Delta-Company.
