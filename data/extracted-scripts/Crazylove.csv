letty,"Listen, Beast. What have I told you about linen?"
letty, It's liver saute.
chandra,Miss Mayer. Miss Mayer.
letty," Goodness, this is a bad one.   Tip your head back."
letty,"Come on. Pinch it, Chandra. Pinch it."
johansen,"Well, I have a full calendar today, and I'm afraid..."
letty,"Mr. Johansen, hello. I'm so sorry I'm late. It's very nice to meet you."
principal gail,The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
letty,I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
letty,A bloody nose...
letty,A bloody nose of epic proportions.
johansen,"OK, Miss Mayer. Ten minutes.     Wow us."
letty,"No cherry drops, Jenny.  He can't? Um, well, tell him, tell him that they went for my math idea. Thanks."
letty," No, about work. How about dinner?"
letty," Paul's fine, just fine."
letty,"Got to go, Mom.   The monsters call."
ruth,Sorry I'm late.
ruth," Tell, tell."
letty,"So, I got the district to approve my after-school math program."
letty,"I'll be running it three days a week, and..."
letty,"Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program."
letty, What's up with you?
ruth,Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
letty,"No, Mom, it's more of a prestige thing."
ruth,Mmmmmmm.
letty,Ruth.   Calling Ruth.
ruth, Sorry.
letty,Just go ahead and tell us.
ruth,There's nothing to tell.
letty,Come on.
ruth,"No, really. Tell me about the promotion."
letty,"Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest..."
ruth, I'm getting married.
letty,Wow.   Congratulations.
ruth, Can you believe it?
letty,You've only known Jake a few months.
ruth,Three and a week.  Isn't it great?
paul,"So, another one bites the dust."
letty,It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
paul,She's only known the guy a few months.
paul,Can I put these here for tonight?
letty," It's kind of romantic, don't you think?"
paul,I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.
letty,"Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter."
paul,The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
letty,My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
paul,Good going. I knew you could do it.
paul,It looks like we're both bucking for advancement.
letty,Yeah?
paul,"Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate."
letty,Congratulations.    We should celebrate.
paul,I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
letty,I mean tonight.
letty,Like right now...
paul,"Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?"
letty,"Oh, ok.   Maybe."
paul,"But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?"
letty, Sure. Of course.
paul,"Letty, please, I need your full attention."
letty,Let me have it.
bobby,"My dog ate my turtle, and the shell went crunch. I brought it for show- and-tell."
letty,"I'm sorry about your turtle Bobby, but you know we only have show-and- tell on Mondays. Today, we're scheduled for grammar."
bobby,But my mom says I have to throw it away tonight.
letty,Don't even think about it.
letty,"Class, why don't you..."
letty, You guys pull out your verb sheets and review them.
ruth,She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
letty,Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
ruth,How?
letty,"I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours."
ruth,Maybe if we had them both to dinner or something.
letty,Maybe.
ruth,"You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty."
letty,"Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going."
ruth,"Please, Letty."
letty,Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
letty,"Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe."
ruth,Really?
letty," You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?"
ruth,And the party?
letty,"Yeah, it'll be fun."
ruth,Thank you so much.
letty,"Who can come up here and give me a sentence with a ""to be"" verb in it?"
zach,Who was that girl?
letty,"Come on up, Zach."
letty,"Neater, Zach."
letty,"Zach, you know the line by the ""a"" has to come straight down or it looks like an ""o."""
letty,"What's wrong, Zach?"
letty,I don't believe it.    You still can't do it.
zach,"I'm sorry, OK, Miss Mayer?"
letty,"No, it's not OK. You'll never get to college on OK."
letty,"It has to be good, Zach.   Do you understand me?"
letty,"I'm very, very sorry, Zach."
letty,"You know what, guys? Wednesday's not a grammar day. It's a collage day. It's a collage ON THE WALL day."
letty,"And, Zach? Zach, I want you to be in charge of paste."
paul,What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
letty,I'm calling in sick.
paul,You don't have a fever.
letty,I don't feel like going to work today.
paul,Won't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late?
letty,It'll be OK.
paul,But what about that math project?
letty,"Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?"
paul,Forget I asked.
letty,I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
paul,Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
letty,"No, it's not like that."
letty,"It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. "
16.,"LETTY And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner."
paul,You can get out of the dinner.
letty,"No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come."
paul,"Come on, Letty.   It'll get done."
letty,I don't think so.
paul,Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
letty,Yeah.
paul,You just need to get more organized. L
letty,Maybe.
paul,"Let's make a list of the things you need to do, OK?"
letty,I see.
letty,Well...
letty,Oh.
letty,What the fuck. It's my job.
clerk,More coffee?
letty,Hit me.
clerk,Danish?
letty, No more bear claws left?
clerk, Danish?
ruth,"Oh, no thanks, I'm too excited to eat."
ruth, Where's Mommy?
letty,Do you have to call her Mommy?
ruth,Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
ruth,What do you think of this one?
letty,I'd have to see it on.
ruth,Have you been crying?    Your eyes are all puffy.
letty,Things have been kind of stressful lately.
ruth,But everything's OK?
letty,"Yeah, everything's under control."
ruth,What about the engagement party?
letty,Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
ruth,"Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it."
letty,You better start trying on before the vultures get all the good ones.
ruth,What about this one?
letty, You look beautiful.
ruth,Really?
letty,Truly.
letty,"Hi, Mom."
ruth,"Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress."
letty,"No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it."
ruth,No more. I can't stand to try on one more dress.
letty,Oh no.
letty,"Mom, please."
ruth,"Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you."
letty, Do you think I should?
ruth,"Yes, yes.    It'll be fun."
letty,Mom?   Mom? Ruth?
clerk,I think they went over to the next shop to take a peek at shoes.
letty, Can I get you a glass of champagne?
letty,"Hi, Dad, Monica.   I'm so glad you could come."
letty,"Mom, this is Monica.   Monica, my mother, Martha."
letty,"Dad, Mother, you've met before, right?"
letty,"It's mushroom-time, folks."
letty,"You can always call it, Dad. M ONICA You must get your cooking skills from your father, Letty."
letty,"Ruth's narrowed the dress hunt down to two, Dad."
ruth,One's a silk...
monica,I remember how hard it was looking for my dress. I must have been to 100 stores.
letty,You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
paul,Yes.
letty,Puglia olives. Would I forget?  A round of martinis coming right up.
ruth,How can I help?
letty,"Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?"
ruth,What about the souffle?    Has that gone in?
letty,"Yeah, I just put it in. But the squab, I think that needs to be basted."
paul, Kind of icy in there.
ruth, Thank God we have alcohol.
letty,Fuck me.
ruth,What's the matter?
paul,Letty?
paul,Let?       L LETTY Olives Aux Herbes De Provence.    I got the wrong kind of olives.
ruth,What's all the dreck?
letty,"Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes."
ruth,It'll be fine.
letty,"No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate."
jake,What do you think of those Lakers?
paul,What are you doing?
letty, Can you loan me a 20?
paul,Sure. Why?
letty,I'm going to the store.
paul,I think you're overreacting.
ruth,"Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle..."
letty,I'll be back before you can say souffle.
letty,I can't find martini olives.     All you have are black.
store clerk, Aisle 2A.
old lady,"Excuse me, Miss. I can't reach the cat food."
old lady,"And a turkey and giblets, too, please. She does like her turkey."
letty,They're not there. I need the ones from Puglia.
letty,"They're the ones that are packed in brine, but they don't overpower the, you know, the palate."
store clerk, Specialty foods. 7B.
letty,Where are they?   Where are they?
letty,Where are they?
manager,"What's wrong, Miss?"
letty,Tell me where they are.
manager,I think you should go now.
letty,I need my olives.
manager,It's time to leave.
manager,"Call security. Where's security, please?"
letty,"Fucking olives. Fucking, fucking olives."
letty,"No, no, no. Go away."
manager, Call police. Now.
michael,Miss Mayer? Miss Mayer?
michael,"I know you've had a rough night, but I have a few questions for you, Miss Mayer, or Letitia."
michael,Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
letty,Letty.
michael," First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?"
letty,I answered these questions last night.
michael,"I know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night."
letty,Hillview Psychiatric Hospital.
michael,"Great. Now, Letty, I'd like you to remember three items. I'm going to ask you to repeat them in just a few minutes. They are chair, cup and ball. Did you get that?"
michael,"OK, let's subtract 6 from a succession of numbers starting with"
michael,And 85 minus 6?
letty,"No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous."
michael,It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing. L Letty smiles uncomfortably.
michael,Now the three things I asked you to remember.
letty,"Chair, cup and ball."
michael,Terrific.
michael,Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
letty,No.
michael,What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again?
michael,How about arranging your possessions in a certain way?
michael,Yes?   Go right ahead.
letty,"Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear."
michael,How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
letty,By color.
michael,What if it's got a pattern?
letty,Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
michael,"I see.  How long has it been since you've done something you've enjoyed, Letty?"
letty," A while, I guess."
michael,That must be really difficult.
michael,"Hey, it'll be OK.   We'll make sure of that."
michael,"For now, why don't you just take it easy while I confer with my colleagues. A nurse should be in shortly."
letty,I did this already.
letty,To be interviewed every hour?
letty,"Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest."
letty,"Yeah, and a dimple."
letty,"Psychologist, therapist, whatever."
letty,What?
letty,What kind of place is this?
letty,I want to see my mother immediately.
letty,I don't think you understand.    I won't wait.
john,I'm in for 5 for manic depressive.
thomas,I'll go with that as well.
marie, Tell me more about the guard she strangled.
michael,"No, just hit in the head."
john,What about voices?    Does she hear voices?
michael,Not that she admits to.
marie,Is she a washer?
michael,"No, but she is exceptionally organized."
thomas,How organized?
michael,She arranges her underwear by color.
michael,"Mrs. Hallstrom, you want in?"
michael,I'll float you.
marie, It's been weeks since she played.
michael,"What about you, Marie?"
marie, And could I get my change in ones?
nurse gates,"Treatment schedules are posted on the bulletin board. Dinner at 6, lights out at 10 and no fraternizing between patients."
nurse gates, That's the rec room. We show movies there on Wednesdays and Fridays...And this is the dining hall.
letty,I'm really not that hungry.
nurse gates,Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
letty,"You know, my mom's coming to get me tomorrow. I'll be leaving."
nurse gates,"It's OK, Letty. I'll be right here with you."
thomas,"So I said to my publisher this afternoon, I said, don't you even--"
nurse gates," Letty, this is Mrs. Hallstrom and Marie, and John and Thomas."
thomas, Just discussing my pesky publisher. May I ask what you do when you're not vacationing?
marie," Let the poor girl get some food, for Heaven's sake."
letty,I'm a teacher.
thomas,"As you may have gathered, I'm a writer."
thomas,"I don't like to say novelist. That sounds a little grandiose, but I am on my third novel and..."
nurse gates,"Excuse me for interrupting, Thomas, but we really should get some food..."
michael, Now I'm going to say that the card you picked was the Ace of Spades.
nurse gates,Michael.
nurse gates,"Michael, this is Letty.      She just arrived yesterday."
letty,We've met.  I missed you during rounds this morning.
nurse gates, This doctor thing has got to stop.
letty,I'm sorry.     I'm so sorry.
letty,"Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... "
40.,"LETTY They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened."
letty,I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
letty,I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
letty,"Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul."
letty,You all really think I need to be here?
letty,But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
letty,And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
letty,Charges?
letty,"Mom, no, please don't go.    Please."
letty,Tomorrow?
marie,Especially the OCD.
michael,"Hey there. They're showing ""Groundhog Day"" if you..."
letty,You took bets on my diagnosis?
michael,It's no big deal.   We all compare.
letty, W ho do you think you are?
michael,Don't take it personally.
letty,"You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game."
michael,Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
letty,"I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's..."
john, He's schizophrenic.
letty,I'm not the one who's schizophrenic. I don't see people who aren't there or run around acting crazy.
patients,"Go, Girl!/ Come on, Michael."
michael,"Oh, no, you're perfectly sane. That's why you're here."
letty,Go fuck yourself.
patients,Bravo./Encore./Re-match.
thomas,"Hell's bells, you can count me in on that. I haven't had enough Z's since I ran those sleep disorder experiments at Stanford back in the 70s."
marie,"We really miss doing things with you, Mrs. Hallstrom."
john,I've noticed Letty doesn't much like to do things with us.
letty,"Oh, no. Of course I do."
john,Then why are you so defensive?
michael, I don't think we need to sacrifice Letty to pep up a slow session.
john, You're the one who told everyone about her panties.
letty,Do we have to talk about this?
letty,Excuse me?
michael,What are you looking to read?
letty,Anything interesting.
michael,This is good.
letty,But you're checking it out.
michael,I've already checked it out 17 times.
letty,You keep the book.   I'm looking for Emily Dickinson.
michael,"Hey, if you take the magic book, I'll feel like maybe you accept my apology and don't hate me anymore."
letty,I haven't heard an apology.
michael,I'm really sorry I hurt your feelings. I got a little carried away. Can you ever forgive me?
michael,"Mrs. Hallstrom, I'm pretty sure you could use that."
michael,"Now, don't you have a gin rummy, Mrs. Hallstrom?  Go ahead, now, just lay those cards down."
michael,Hot damn. Gin rummy. I told you so. You're three games up on me.
paul,It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
letty,"Yeah, I guess it's all right."
paul,Are you all right?
letty,That's a big question.
paul,I hope it wasn't something I did.
letty,Something you did?
paul,That put you in here.
letty,"Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?"
paul,I think we need to talk about some things.
letty,"Yes, I suppose so."
paul,"This has been really difficult, this whole thing. "
49.,"PAUL I mean, we've been going out for four years, and it hasn't always been so easy."
letty,No.
paul,Especially this last year.
letty, Especially now.
paul,"So, I've been thinking a lot..."
letty,"I have too, Paul."
paul,"I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time..."
letty,I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
paul,Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
letty,You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
paul,I just wish we'd done it sooner.
paul,Will you marry me?
paul,I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
letty, Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
paul,"I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  L Letty?"
letty,"It's, it's really nice, Paul."
paul,You can take it back and we can have one custom made if you want.
letty,"No, you've done a perfect job."
paul,"So, what do you say, Let?"
letty,"Do you think, really, that it's OK to get engaged when I'm in here?"
paul,Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
letty,"No, no."
paul,So will you?
letty, Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
michael,You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
letty,I wasn't hungry.
michael,John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
letty, Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
michael,Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
letty,Paul.
michael,He looked pretty serious.
letty,He asked me to marry him.
michael,Very romantic setting.
letty,It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
michael,"So are you engaged, or what?"
letty,What have you done with the ring?
michael,It's magic.
letty,This isn't funny.   Paul would kill me.
michael,Guess which hand.
letty,Enough with the abracadabra.
michael,Guess.
letty,T he left one.
michael, The audience says one more try. What guess you now?
letty,The right one.
letty,"Come on, Michael."
michael,"With this ring, I thee..."
letty,"Really, this isn't funny."
michael,"OK, OK, I'll give it back."
michael,For a price.
letty,Good God.
michael,A small price.
letty,I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
michael,No.
letty,And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
michael,I want a kiss.
letty,Get serious.
michael,I'm serious.
letty, Everything's a joke with you.
michael,Here.
letty,The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
letty,"I think I've told you all the news. Let's see--the engagement. Oh, and my sister's coming to visit me, and they say my cat misses me."
letty,"I miss Beast a lot, too."
intercom,Hark the Herald Angels sing...
nurse gates,What are you doing?
michael, Not me.
nurse gates,Mrs. Hallstrom?
nurse gates,"Come on. Come with me, Mrs. Hallstrom."
marie,Hot boxers.
letty,I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
ruth,Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
letty,That settles it. I'm never leaving.
ruth,I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
letty,You're slowing.
ruth, Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
ruth,What do you think?
letty,Ecru.
ruth,And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?
letty,Do we have to talk wedding details?
ruth,"Oh, no, of course not."
letty,"I mean, you can always send me fabric samples to look at or pictures of dresses. But, it's been so long since we've seen each other."
ruth,"Of course. You're right. Besides, we should be talking about your engagement."
letty,Tell me more about Beast beating up that other cat.
ruth,"Bloody furry mess, like I said.  Letty?"
ruth,"What's going on with you, Letty?"
letty,"Ruthie, do you ever wonder if you'll meet someone else...someone besides Jake?"
ruth,"What's his name, Letty?"
letty,I didn't say...
ruth,Don't even try.    What's his name?
nurse gates,"Lights out, Letty."
letty,We're supposed to be asleep.
michael,Exactly.
letty,We'll get caught.
michael,No rounds for another three hours.
michael,Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions? L LETTY Don't be ridiculous.
nurse gates,"Letty, you should be in bed."
letty,There's a spider in my room.
nurse gates,Yeah?
letty,It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
nurse gates,Sounds awful. I guess we better check it out.
michael,Extra large pepperoni and mushrooms.  Hillview Psychiatric Hospital on Glenfield. Off the Fourth Street exit.
letty,It had this red spot on its back.
nurse gates,Green spot.
letty,Mottled really.   Green and red.
nurse gates,"I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty."
letty,Lie?
nurse gates,"If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so."
letty,"To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good. N URSE GATES I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start."
jim,I'm afraid I can't let you take that in without the proper invoice.
michael,It's a pizza.
jim,"All the same, rules are rules."
michael,"You don't understand. This is a very important, very special, morale-boosting pizza."
jim,"What I understand is how low morale gets when you're posted at a guard station all night, Val."
letty,I don't mean to go on and on like this.
nurse gates,It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
nurse gates,Did you ever tell Paul how you felt?
letty,"He was graduating from law school, and he just assumed I was OK with dropping out.  We never really talked about it. But I know he was disappointed in me."
letty,I mean I'm just not sure I want the same things now that I did even a month ago.
letty,Is that so wrong?
nurse gates,You can only do what feels best to you now.
letty,I guess so. I think that's right.
letty,You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
nurse gates,I'm glad.
letty,And if I need to talk again...
nurse gates,"Yes, of course. Whenever you want."
letty,Sorry I'm late...
michael,Shhh.
michael,How's it look?
michael,I like those sapphire earrings myself.
marie,Jesus...just get a room.
letty,I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
letty,"I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself. D R. EMLEE What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his..."
letty,"I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur."
letty,I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
66.,"DR. EMLEE You could be lying next to Michael in bed one night, and he could have a hallucination, or a delusion. It might happen when you're driving or..."
letty,"Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication."
letty,I don't want to hear anymore.
letty,"First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop."
michael,A daisy for the lady.
letty,The lady knows this is a dandelion.
michael,A rose is a rose.
letty,Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
michael,Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
letty,Sounds important.
michael,I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
letty,Really?    Me too.
michael,"I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery."
letty,Wow.    I'm bad news.
michael,What's my rap?
letty,Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
michael,Fuck.    That's all true.
michael,"Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes."
letty,What are the delusions like?
michael,"I think people are after me, crap like that. "
68.,"MICHAEL When I was 18, my mom came home and found me sitting naked on the kitchen table. I thought I was God."
michael,"Shocking, huh?"
letty,Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
michael,I wish I could have seen that.
letty,I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
michael,"M y Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight. Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light.  But even though they end up crooked, they're still trees, just like the straight ones."
michael, Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
letty,Break up?    They wish.
delivery man,"I need a signature, please."
nurse gates,What is all this stuff?
delivery man,"I just deliver it, Ma'am."
nurse gates,"Well, who exactly is it for?"
delivery man,A Mrs. Eunice Hallstrom.
nurse gates,I see. Can you wait a moment?
john,She doesn't know what the hell she's talking about.
nurse gates,"I'm sorry, Doctor. I just need a moment with Mrs. Hallstrom."
nurse gates,"They say she ordered...Mrs. Hallstrom, did you order a bunch of stuff, because Federal Express... M rs. Hallstrom's face glows."
john, Thomas got a crown and all I got was a lousy bracelet?
nurse gates,"Your mother's in the rec room, Letty."
letty,"You too, Mom."
letty,Which flowers did you order?
letty,"Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway."
letty,This would complement the blue in the bride's maids' dresses. Look.
letty,"We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom."
letty,I haven't had a crush since I was
letty,I'll put it out if it bothers you.
letty,What?
letty,"Mom, please."
letty,"Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that."
letty," And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke."
thomas,"Mrs. Mayer, I'm sorry but I couldn't help overhearing. I just wanted to say, not that it's any of my business..."
thomas,"I think, really, I think I'd go with the cream damask. I NT. REC ROOM - LATER"
nurse gates,It's OK to be upset.
michael,"Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa."
letty,"If you change your mind, we'll be in the dining hall."
rosa, Send down the lamb. This girl's as thin as a stick.
letty,"Oh, no.   I'm stuffed."
rosa,"Tell her to eat, Frank."
michael, You can't turn down Grandma Rosa's lamb.
rosa,"Or my eggplant. I make the best eggplant in L.A. The mozzarella I use, it's so fresh it sweats."
letty,I was. I'm hoping I'll still have a job when I get out.
letty,What's she doing?
rosa,Grazie.
michael,"Mrs. Hallstrom, join us. Please."
letty,"Michael, we've got to stop her."
michael,You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
letty,I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
michael,The mission up in Santa Barbara.
letty,No way.
michael,That's where I always go when I get out.
letty,Why?
michael,My dad used to take me there when I was little. It's totally quiet. And you can see the ocean for miles.
letty,What else would you do?
michael,I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
letty,And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
michael,How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
letty,I have a terrible confession.
michael,Tell the doctor.
letty,I don't like lamb.
michael,Then it's over.
letty,Lie down.
michael,It's a good thing my family loves you.
letty,Your family just met me.
michael,"You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, ""It's a good thing I love you."""
letty,Do you?
michael,I do.
letty,"Michael, I..."
michael,It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
letty,"But I do.     I love you, too."
michael,"Your Honor, I feel I should be released. I'm sufficiently able to look after..."
michael, What? What?
letty,John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
michael,"Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?"
letty," Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck."
judge milton,Why have you petitioned to leave the institution?
john,"I haven't had an episode in more than a month, Sir."
judge milton,How do you plan to support yourself?
john,"My family's helping me out, Your Honor."
judge milton,Where will you live upon release?
john,Live?
judge milton,"Where do you plan to reside, Mr. Lockyer?"
john,With my mother.
judge milton,Is your mother here today?
john,That's the bitch. That cock- sucking bitch. She put me here. She did. She's the Satan that did this all.
judge milton,The records indicate no major episodes in the past four months. And it seems you have the support of the staff.
michael,"Yes, Sir."
judge milton,But I see you've been in and out of the hospital more than ten times.
michael,"Eleven, Your Honor.   But I'm on a new medication now."
judge milton,Do you feel ready to re-enter the world?
michael,"Yes, Sir. My family is    prepared to support me until I find   a job. They've already located   an apartment for me that's   very near them."
judge milton,"Very well, then. By order of the court, you are released. I wish you good luck."
paul,What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
letty,"I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how."
paul,You can tell me anything.  Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
letty,No...
paul,That's a load off my mind.
letty,"Paul, I want to break off the engagement. P AUL You what?"
letty,I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
paul,"Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems."
letty,I've met someone else.
paul,Who?
letty,It doesn't matter who.
paul,Have you been seeing another teacher?
letty,No.
paul,"It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin."
letty,He's a patient here.
paul,"Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?"
letty,I love him.
paul,You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
letty,Here's the ring.
paul,No way. You keep the ring.     You'll come to your senses.
letty,"I've made my decision, Paul."
paul,"You keep it, Letty. This is not over. Our life is not over."
michael,"How's it hanging, Paul?"
michael,Visitor for Ms. Mayer.
letty,Well?        M ICHAEL Home free.
nurse,"Letty, Michael, you have about five minutes until visiting hours end."
letty,Tell me all.
michael,"I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane."
letty,So there were no problems?
michael,Not a one.
letty,And did you go to the mission?
michael,"No, you goof, I came to see you."
letty,Just checking.
michael,I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
letty,Yeah.
michael,"So, it's over?"
letty,All over.  Did you see your new apartment?
michael,"One bedroom, second floor, no view."
letty,Furnished?
michael,"No, I need some serious household advice."
letty,"First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?"
michael,I better make a list.
letty,List schmist. You'll remember.
thomas,Hit me.
thomas,I'm over.
nurse gates," Dr. Stone will ask you some questions, and then we'll get you settled."
nurse gates," Lights out in 15, Guys."
arie,"Wow, that first night is hard."
letty,It's going to be a difficult few weeks for him.
thomas,It really makes you think.
letty,It really does.
marie,I'll put in 5 that it's a straight diagnosis of depressive personality.
letty,"Are you kidding? With those glazed eyes? I'm willing to bet 10 there was some break with reality going on there. Psychosis. Without a doubt, psychosis."
letty,But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
letty,"I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out."
letty,What?
letty,Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
letty,"It's good exercise, Mom."
letty,I've already made arrangements.
letty,"Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael."
letty,Nyet.   That's the condition.
letty,One more and you're out.
letty,A deal's a deal.
letty,"OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off."
letty,"I have a going-away gesture for you, too."
letty,"I'll miss you, Mrs. Hallstrom."
nurse gates,"Take care, Letty. And, let me know if you need help with any spiders."
letty,You know I will.       Thanks for everything.
michael,"See you later, guys."
michael,Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
letty,Aren't you ever quiet?
michael,Where to?
letty,I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
michael,This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
letty,Open up.    I want to see.
michael,Close your eyes.
michael,OK.    Open them.
letty,Wow.
michael,You like it?
letty,I love the pillows.
michael,"Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing."
letty,Very trendy. Let's see the rest.
letty,It's TV heaven.
michael,I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
letty,Let's try out the bed.
michael,You've got to see the kitchen first.
michael,Do you like it?
letty,I love your apartment.
michael,Really?
letty,You'll never get rid of me.
letty,What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
michael,Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
letty,How can you not like the Top 10 List?
michael,I like it.     But Headlines are better.
letty,You're so wrong.
michael,Hey.
letty,It's sex time.
michael,I think it's my turn.
letty,Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
michael,No.
letty,Michael.
michael,Shhhh.
michael,Letty?   Rise and shine.
letty,Not yet.
michael,I'll be forced to tickle you.
letty,I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
michael,I'll see you tonight.
letty,Good luck.
michael,"You, too. Kick ass today."
letty,My apartment tonight.   You can meet Beast.
michael,"Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?"
letty,Yeah?
michael, You've got one hell of a great body.
principal gail,I didn't have any choice but to include the parents' letters in your file.
letty,"Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor."
principal gail,"So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet."
letty,"Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher."
principal gail,"I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on..."
letty,"Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better. P RINCIPAL GAIL I'm glad you're doing well."
letty,I've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was.
letty,"And I'd like to send the parents this letter of explanation. With your support, I think they can accept me."
principal gail,It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
letty,What does that mean?
principal gail,I need someone to work on budget projections.
letty,Office work?
principal gail,"Or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year."
michael,"I know, but as I said..."
michael,I can do the job.
michael,Right.   Thanks for your help.
letty,It's open.
michael,"Gosh, Letty, this is a great place."
letty,Thanks.
letty,That's Mr. Beast to you.
michael,How was your day?
letty,I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
michael,Sounds grim.
letty,Yeah.    How was the job search?
letty,Who ever said sanity was fun?
michael,It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
letty,Promise?
michael,Promise.  As long as we have steak.
letty,Steak?
michael,It's a well-known fact that a red- meat dinner can cure the blues.  You and Beast wait here. I'll be back in a jiff.
michael,While I'm gone why don't you slip into something a little more naked?
lady one,I can't believe he did that.
lady two,What a weirdo.
michael,"Don't ever talk about me again, you hear me?"
letty,I thought maybe you got lost.
michael,The store was busy.
letty,You got wine. That's great.
michael,Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
letty,You go ahead and relax. I'll cook. M ICHAEL I think I should go home.
letty,Are you OK?
michael,Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
letty,But what about the red meat-blues thing?
michael,"You know, we've got that dinner with my parents tomorrow, too. I should really get some rest tonight."
letty, How's filet sound?
michael," No, no, no. Not now. No."
letty,I'll never Mget the hang of this.
letty,"Hi, Frank."
letty, Maybe we should make lamb next week.
letty,How'd it go?
letty,What happened?
michael,Four interviews. Four no-gos.
letty,"The restaurant, too?"
michael,I couldn't even face that one.
letty,That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
michael,"You don't have to take care of me, you know."
michael, Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
letty,I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
michael,Coming.
letty,I think I could get the program up and running in the next two weeks.
johansen,From what I understand the principal has removed you from student activities.
letty,She's worried that I'm unstable.
letty,But I wouldn't push for the program if I wasn't ready.
johansen,What about the office work?
letty,"I'd have to do that, too. But I've gotten better at pacing myself."
johansen,Are you sure?
letty,I'll call you if I have problems. Scout's honor.
johansen,I have to say I'm inclined to give it another try.
johansen,"But, Letty, why don't you give yourself three weeks to set it up this time?"
michael,"Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer."
letty,I got worried. Are you OK?
letty,Congratulations.
letty, Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
letty,"He's been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom.   It's not that easy after you've been locked away."
letty,I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
letty,Just remember that I love him.
michael,Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
letty,"No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker."
michael,"Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?"
letty,You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
aunt lily, What a beautiful wedding.
michael, Aunt Lily?
letty,Bingo.
ruth,The worst was when I stammered Jake's name.
letty,I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
ruth,That's thanks to all your help.
letty,"Uh oh, Uncle Cort at 6 o'clock."
ruth,Sorry to do this to you. But I am the bride.
cort, I don't think I've seen you in two or three years.
letty,Has it been that long?
cort,You were with that lawyer.
letty,I'm dating Michael now.
cort,Met him in the receiving line. What is it that he does for a living?
letty,"Well, he just got a job... M ICHAEL In the restaurant business."
cort,Speak of the devil.  How did you guys meet again?
letty,At the psych hospital.
cort,"I would've sent a card, but your aunt and I, we weren't sure if that was the thing to do."
letty,"That's fine, Uncle Cort."
cort, So you were a volunteer over at the hospital?
michael,Something like that.
letty,When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
michael, How about a dance?
cort,You two go ahead. I'm going to go bother that pretty sister of yours for a dance.
letty,"Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?"
michael,It wasn't exactly a lie.
letty,Pretty close.
michael,People at weddings don't want the truth.
letty,It's not good to drink so much with the medication you're on.
michael,What's with this music? I'll go talk to the D.J. and see if we can't get something good going.
letty,"Thanks, dad."
letty,Michael?  Michael? You should come to bed.
letty,Did you take the aspirin and water? You don't want to feel awful in the morning.  I'll get you some.
letty,What is it? Are you OK?
michael, Always the drugs.
letty,What?
michael,I saw you talking to my Mom.
letty,"We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad."
michael,Why'd you tell her I wasn't taking my meds?
letty,What do you mean not taking your meds?
michael,Why'd you tell?
letty,"I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly."
michael,Silly?   Silly am I?
letty,"Michael, take it easy."
michael,"Silly, silly, silly."
letty,I think I should call someone.
michael, Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
letty,"Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK."
letty,"Michael, stop."
michael,Not my Mom. Not my silly silly Mom.
letty,I've got an emergency.    I'm at...
letty,1450 North Jenkins. Apartment 2. My boyfriend's out of control.
letty," No, he's having an attack. He's schizophrenic..."
letty,"I'm sorry, so sorry.   I never should have called."
ruth,You did the right thing.
letty,I ruined your wedding night.
ruth,"I'm glad you called. Now, not another word about it."
ruth,Oh my God.
ruth,Did he hurt you?
letty,"Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do? R UTH You don't have to make any decisions tonight."
letty,But what am I going to do?
ruth,Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
letty,I can't.    I can't see him there.
letty,"I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth."
ruth,I know.    I know.
paul,I'm glad you agreed to see me.
letty,I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
paul,"Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on."
letty,Oh.
paul,How's work going?    Are you back at school?
letty,I start on Monday.
paul,So things are back on track?
letty,Getting back.
paul,I heard about your friend.
letty,What?
paul,I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
letty,Michael.   Yes.
paul,"I just wondered, well, if this meant there was a chance for us. Because I think about you a lot, and I still feel..."
letty,"Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things."
paul,I think I've heard this speech before.
letty,I'm really sorry.
letty,"Sure, I understand."
letty,Wait. Wait.
letty,I need to give you this.
nurse gates,He's in Jamie's old room.
letty,Hi.
michael,Hey.
letty,I guess we need to talk.
michael,I guess so.
letty,It's hard to know where to start.
michael,Pretend like I'm your shrink.
michael,Sorry.   I'll be quiet.
letty,I think about you all the time.
michael,I sure know what that feels like.
letty,And all the plans we have.
michael,"Yeah, the plans."
letty,"I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see..."
michael,"Letty, please. L LETTY What?"
michael,Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
letty,"Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications."
michael,But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
letty,Well then why'd it happen?
michael,I don't know. I don't fucking know.
letty,I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
michael,I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
letty,"Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?"
letty,What are we going to do?
michael,What do you want to do?
letty,I know I don't want to lose you.     I don't think I could stand it.
michael,"Yeah, but can you stand to be with me like this?"
letty,"No. I can't, Michael. I'm so sorry, but I just can't handle all this right now."
michael,I know.   I can't either.
letty,I love you so much.
michael,"I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too."
letty,Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
michael,That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
letty,Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
michael,How about something better?   Like a kiss. T he couple kisses more tenderly than ever before.
letty,"I can still come visit you, you know."
michael,Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
letty,"Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?"
michael,I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
michael,Promise you won't fall for any guys pretending to be doctors.
letty,I guess I should go now.
michael,You should go.
letty,"First of all, I want to welcome you to MathShop. I have lots of fun games planned for us.  Let's see, Bobby, can you help me pass out these cards?"
letty,"Is something wrong, Bobby?"
bobby,Why were you gone so long?
jenny,My mom said you went crazy.
letty,I had what some people call a nervous breakdown. I wasn't dealing with life so well so I went...
bobby,To a place for psychos.
letty,To a psychiatric institution. J ENNY What's that?
letty,"It's a place where you figure out what you want, and what things in your life aren't working. You learn to look out for yourself and not get..."
letty,Let me show you the best thing I learned.
