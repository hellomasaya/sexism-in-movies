Speaker,Dialogue
magyar, And porkolts. You know porkolts?
jim prideaux," Yes, I've had it."
magyar,It's very good. Better than goulash. But you won't get it in Budapest now.
jim prideaux,Why's that?
magyar,All the pigs have gone to Moscow.
jim prideaux,When do I get to meet your friend?
magyar,I'll take you to him. Not eating?
jim prideaux,Would you excuse me a moment?
kgb man,No firing!
percy alleline," I wish I could have done more, Control."
control," Well, a man should know when to leave the party."
toby esterhase,What about Smiley?
control,Smiley is leaving with me.
bill haydon,You little prick Esterhase.
polyakov, Shall we begin?
lacon, This is private property. Who are you?
ricki tarr,Minister Lacon.
lacon,What do you want?
ricki tarr,I want to talk to Control. And I want breakfast.
peter guillam, Has that been cleared?
bill haydon,"I'm not bloody chaining it outside. Mind you, probably no safer in here, with you bunch of cut-throats."
haydon,Thought I'd get a glimpse of the new girl. Before Bland gets to her. He seen her yet?
guillam,Oh yes. Down first thing.
haydon,"You may fuck me, Belinda, but you still have to call me sir in the morning."
peter guillam,Peter Guillam...
smiley," Have I time to change?  Guillam nods, following Smiley into the house. He glances at a painting on the wall - a muddy ABSTRACT. He crosses to examine it and then notices the bundle of Ann's unopened letters."
smiley,Are we going far?
lacon,How's your mother?
peter guillam,Very well.  Is this where he got out?
lacon,"Mmm, I came back in and it was wide open.  Do send her my love. Apologies for singling you out, but... very sensitive matter..."
peter guillam,"Ricki Tarr, sir. One of my scalp- hunters. He's been on the wanted list for a year. Last job was Istanbul, bit of coat-trailing for a Russian convention."
lacon,Why is he on the wanted list?
peter guillam, He killed our man in Istanbul. Cut his throat. Been on the run since then.
lacon,My God. In my own home... my family... The bloody animals you people employ!
lacon,"And how are you George? Missing one's work, one's buddies?"
smiley,"Oh, I think I manage pretty well, thank you."
lacon,"Your wife, the lovely Ann? She's in the pink, and so on."
smiley,Very well.  Very bonny...
lacon,Do you know this man Tarr?
smiley, I recruited him actually. In Penang. Good with women. Likes to talk. What did he say to you?
lacon,"He said he had some intelligence for Control. Had no idea he was dead. The news obviously hadn't reached Wonga Wonga land. Then he said he would only tell it to someone outside the Circus. If he couldn't have a Minister, he would settle for the Under-secretary. Lucky me."
lacon,"I was sad to see you go, George. I thought it was shabby, very shabby. "
smiley,"I am retired, Oliver."
lacon,"Thing is, some time back, when Control was still alive, he came to me with a similar suggestion."
smiley,No.
lacon,"I just thought... with you being ""his man"", so to speak."
smiley,What did you say to him?
lacon, I'm afraid I thought his paranoia had got the better of him and he was pulling his own house down. That does happen in your business. And that bloody mess in Budapest...
smiley, I'll keep Peter Guillam. And there's a retired special branch man. Mendel. I'd like to have him.
lacon,"Yes, yes. Do your own housekeeping. Good man."
smiley,"No, we never did."
mendel,Her real name is plain Graham. Added the Pope for a touch of class.
smiley,Control lived with his sister didn't he?
mendel,Basingstoke. Not much of a paper- trail as you can imagine. His pension and she owns a block of bedsits in her own name in West London.
guillam,We should...
mendel,... Webb and Bryson are the letting agents. Properties in half of the west end judging by this list...
smiley,We're only looking for short term rentals. Within the last year.
smiley,How long was H. Staunton a tenant?
mendel, Still is. Been renting for a few years now. Something?
smiley, Howard Staunton. Control used to say he was England's greatest chess master. Died in eighteen seventy- four.
toby esterhase,Help you with something Bill?
bill haydon,Looking for his Majesty.
toby esterhase, He's walking the battlements.
bill haydon, Much obliged.
alleline, Roy.
bland,It's the Yanks. They want to come in and talk.
alleline,Of course they do. We have Witchcraft. And they don't.
smiley,Thank you. Anywhere will do.
mendel, That enough for you to be getting on with?
smiley," No. Peter, I need you to do something for me..."
kaspar," Sorry Peter, didn't know you were doing... whatever you were doing...?"
peter guillam,Trying not to bleed to death. Fawley's got a first aid kit in one of his drawers. Get me a plaster will you?  Kaspar busies himself with the first-aid. Eyes hard.
roy bland, Heard you had an accident.
peter guillam,Cut it on a drawer handle.  When are we going to get some new furniture round here?
roy bland,"I'll have a word with Esterhase, Peter. We'll make it a priority on the top floor."
peter guillam,Lunch.
roy bland,Want some company?
roy bland,"Tell you the truth, I'm in no hurry to get back up there..."
peter guillam,Smothered by the Mothers.
roy bland,"Something like that. Those old birds, all pining for Control. Percy still can't get a decent cup of tea out of them. Still, I imagine it takes time."
peter guillam,What does?
roy bland,Loyalty.
peter guillam, Here.
roy bland, What do you think of Datsuns?
peter guillam,What?
roy bland,"Datsuns. Just got one. Wife made me. Hatchback. Caught sight of myself in it, driving past a shop window and I thought to myself ""Who's that old fucker?"""
peter guillam,Citroen.
roy bland,"French? Ooh la la...  He continues to stare at Guillam with the faint smile, and Guillam feels a sickening wave of paranoia.  ROY BLAND  Drink up and I'll drop you back. You've probably got some girl waiting..."
peter guillam,"Jerry Westerby, dismissed December 4th. And... Connie Sachs, retired November 28th. That's just two weeks after you and Control were forced out."
smiley,I know that car.
lacon,On our way to La Bohme. The Minister wondered if there was anything to report?
smiley,"Not much, I'm afraid. We were just discussing the departure of Connie Sachs. I wonder how Research manages without her."
peter guillam,Probably relieved. She always struck me as unhinged.
smiley,That was one of her talents.
lacon," Looking a little unhinged yourself, George."
smiley, Hmm?
lacon, Control lost his position because of that fiasco in Budapest... that poor chap...?
peter guillam,Jim Prideaux.
smiley,"Yes. Yes, he did."
lacon,How did you get this? This is Witchcraft material.
smiley,Control was out. And Alleline was in. Thanks to...
smiley,Return to Oxford please.
smiley," Oh, I brought..."
connie sachs, Not supposed to. Doctor's orders.
smiley,You left the Circus shortly after I retired...
connie sachs,I didn't leave. I was dismissed. Chucked out on the rubbish heap.  Like you.
smiley, Why?
connie sachs,"""Lost my sense of proportion."" That's what that personnel cow said. Wouldn't let go of a bone."
smiley,Which bone?
connie sachs,Polyakov.
smiley,Polyakov.
connie sachs,Cultural Attach Polyakov.
smiley,Stationed where?
connie sachs,"Here. London. Turned up in sixty five. And I had a feeling, as soon as I laid eyes on him. But that little swine Toby Esterhase told me I was seeing Spies under the bed."
smiley,Esterhase said that?
connie sachs,He had him graded Persil. Whiter than white. And that was that.
smiley,But you disagreed?
connie sachs,"Pretty Polly? Very military bearing for someone who's never supposed to have been in the army. But, he was good. Went to Embassy functions, lectures. I love a man who lives his cover. Never put a foot wrong."
smiley, Never?
connie sachs, Pretty Polly. Pretty Polly...
percy alleline, You're to leave Polyakov alone. You're becoming obsessed with him.
connie sachs,Hate the real world. I know you never liked him.
smiley, What nonsense. What on earth makes you say that?
connie sachs, I don't know.
smiley," It was the war, Connie."
connie sachs,A real war. Englishmen could be proud then.
polyakov,"... He says ""Father, father, I've just had sex with two 17 year old girls."" The Priest says ""That's quite a sin, but you're an Atheist, General Secretary..."""
control,Step into my lair.
control, Sit down and take a look at this nonsense.
smiley, Where did you get it?
control,I didn't. Percy and his little cabal walked in with it.
toby esterhase, Control...
control,"Shut up, Esterhase."
smiley,If it's genuine it's gold-dust.  But its topicality makes it suspect.
control,"Smiley is suspicious, Percy. Smells a fake."
smiley,Where does it come from? What's the access?
control,Percy doesn't feel like telling.
percy alleline,A new secret source of mine.
smiley,But how could he possibly have access to...?
percy alleline,He has access to the most sensitive levels of policy making.
smiley, We?
control,"Percy and his pals have bypassed us, Smiley. Gone straight to the Minister. Everyone's very excited. Percy's to be allowed to keep the identity of his new friend top secret."
percy alleline,"The Minister agrees with me that too many secrets are blown around here. Too much failure, too many scandals, too little solid intelligence!"
control,Luckily Percy's cabal has come to save us.
percy alleline, It's all office politics here.
roy bland,"Percy does have a point, Control. We should be fighting communism, not each other."
percy alleline,"Meanwhile we're losing our reputation, our partners..."
control,Your bloody Yanks!
percy alleline," And we've had enough! There's going to be changes, Smiley! Changes."
toby esterhase,"We need to decide if we're part of the past, or part of the future."
control, I should have left you where I found you.
roy bland,"Control, if we could all just..."
control,OUT! ALL OF YOU!
smiley, If Witchcraft is genuine...
control,I don't trust miracles.
mendel, Courtesy of Mrs P. You been up all night?
smiley,Yes.
mendel,What's that?
smiley,Request for a thousand pound's in cash from the reptile fund.
mendel,What for?
smiley,For a Mister Ellis.
mendel,Who's Ellis?
smiley,It was one of Jim Prideaux's work names.
mendel,What's so strange about that then?
smiley,The date. Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago. October twenty first. So why was 
prideaux,Hand those out.
prideaux, Come down here.
roach,Yes sir.
prideaux,"Gave me a turn up there, parked on the horizon. Thought you were a Juju man. What's your name?"
bill roach,"Sir, Roach, sir. Bill. I'm a new boy."
prideaux,"New arrival, eh? Middle of year? What's the story?"
bill roach," My mother and father... my father's left, so..."
prideaux,Bill? The unpaid Bill. Anyone ever call you that?
bill roach,No sir.
prideaux,Known a lot of Bills. They've all been good `uns. What you good at?
bill roach,Nothing sir.
prideaux,"You're a good watcher though eh? Us loners always are. No one else spotted me when I turned up here. Best watcher in the unit, Bill Roach is, I'll bet. Long as he's got his specs on. Right?"
bill roach, Yes sir.
prideaux,"Free period, isn't it? Don't waste it down here."
ricki tarr,Hello Mister Smiley. You remember me.
smiley,"Hello, Ricki."
ricki tarr,Losing my touch.
smiley,"Where've you been, Ricki?"
ricki tarr,"Here, there. Run out of places now. They're gonna kill me."
smiley,Who is?
ricki tarr,"Your lot. Or their lot. Whoever gets me first. I'm innocent, by the way. Within reason.  You going to find him then? The Mole?"
smiley,I'm going to try. How long have you been here?
ricki tarr,Few days. Needed somewhere to hide.
smiley,I wouldn't use my home as a safe house. There's every chance they're watching it.
ricki tarr,"Calculated risk Mister Smiley. I wanted to see you, figured you'd turn up here sooner or later."
smiley,What do you want Ricki?
ricki tarr,There's a woman. I want you to trade for her. Get her back from Karla.
smiley,What woman?
ricki tarr,Her name's Irina.
tufty thesinger, This is going to be a long night.
ricki tarr,You baby-sit this one.  Ricki walks towards us.
ricki tarr,Your bloke's a bit of a bastard.  Just wanted to check you were alright.
smiley,You were due to fly home the next day. What did you tell London?
ricki tarr,Nothing. Didn't have anything to tell yet. But... I could sense it in her.
smiley,Sense what?
ricki tarr,A secret.
irina,I know what you are.
smiley,What made you so sure she wasn't coat-trailing?
ricki tarr,We've all got our strengths. And weaknesses.
smiley,She had children in Russia?
ricki tarr,"That's why they let her and Boris out. So, I said I'd tell the Circus."
smiley, But you didn't?
irina,"If I tell you, I'm putting my life in your hands. The lives of my children? Do you understand?"
irina, Promise me you'll be careful. No details to the Circus. Not until we're safe.
ricki tarr, I promise.
tufty thesinger,You were supposed to have gone. London stations's been on to me. They want to know what the hell you're doing.
ricki tarr, Fuck off.
smiley,"And what did your message say, Ricki?"
ricki tarr,Just that I had a Moscow Centre trained hood wanting to defect.
smiley,What else?
ricki tarr,I know what I am to the Circus. One of the scalp-hunters. Someone to give the dirty jobs to. I wanted to bring this one in myself.
smiley,Yes. I quite see that.
ricki tarr,I said that she claimed to have information crucial to the well- being of the Circus.
ricki tarr,That she had information concerning a Double Agent.
smiley,What happened next Ricki?
ricki tarr,I waited for a reply.
ricki tarr,"They put her on a ship. That's all I know. I've done a lot of things Mister Smiley, but... I don't know why... I keep thinking about her. "
smiley,"Where are you going Ricki? You said yourself, Karla will be looking for you. I can take you somewhere. Keep you safe."
ricki tarr,Who's going to keep you safe?
oliver lacon,Percy has always resisted suggestions of wider exploitation of Witchcraft's intelligence.
minister,"Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon."
percy alleline,"I've refused to share Witchcraft with our allies, so far, Minister."
minister,Greedy boy.
percy alleline,My goal has been to establish his track record beyond all doubt. I think the time has come to approach our American brothers-in- arms.
minister,You think they'll take us back into bed?
percy alleline,I'm not interested in a one-off trade. I want on-going access to American intelligence.
minister,Do you think we can get it?
percy alleline,"With Witchcraft on our side, I think we can get anything we bloody-well want."
control,Percy. Did you do this?
percy alleline,I followed the recipe.
control,Smiley? Where's Ann? Get me a lady of taste? Ann will sort it out.
smiley, I'll go find her.
peter guillam,You look tired.
smiley,Yes. I didn't sleep well.  If you have the slightest reservation...
peter guillam,Is feeling sick to your stomach a slight reservation?
smiley,"If you're caught, Peter, you can't mention me. I'm sorry, but you're alone."
mendel,You're clean. Nothing on your back. Nothing on your conscience.
bryant,Mister Guillam? How's the family?
peter guillam,"Fine, Bryant. Up to Registry today."
bryant,Okay sir. Yellow one for the bag sir.
peter guillam,"Time you oiled this thing, isn't it?"
peter guillam,You're kidding?
janitor pete,New rules.
peter guillam,Mind the jewels.
janitor pete,Pen and watch sir.
peter guillam,"You don't look pleased to see me, Bill?"
bill haydon,Why would I be? You bloody pariah.
peter guillam,Doing some research. Makes a change from sitting on my arse.
bill haydon,Heard it was quiet down there.
peter guillam,As the grave. When're you going to give us something to do?
bill haydon,Haven't you heard? Technology's the future. No need for you apes anymore. I can get you a posting to Northern Ireland if that helps get the blood racing.
peter guillam,Thanks anyway. Stick to sitting on my arse.
janitor alwyn," Want me to look after that for you, Mister Guillam?"
peter guillam,Thanks...
janitor alwyn,Gotta give you a chit. The Dolphin'll kill me if I don't. New Rules.
peter guillam,"So, chit me."
sal,What you up to this weekend?
peter guillam, Visiting aunts.
sal,I'll bet.
janitor alwyn, Telephone sir.
peter guillam," Oh to hell, who is it?"
janitor alwyn,"Outside line, sir. Someone rough. The garage, I think, regarding your car."
peter guillam," Well, damn. Can't you do the bloody repair?"
mendel,"Can't be done sir, you're going to need a new gear box."
peter guillam,At least get on to the main dealers first...
peter guillam,"Well, hold on..."
toby esterhase,Could we see you Peter?
peter guillam,Of course.
janitor alwyn,Will do sir.
toby esterhase,"The Chief will take no calls, please, ladies..."
mother, We can hear.
toby esterhase,We are having a conference.
percy alleline," Well now young Peter Guillam, are you ready for me finally?"
peter guillam,"Couple of Arab ploys look quite promising. Other than that, getting quite good at ping-pong."
percy alleline,Arabs... You can rent one but you can't buy one. Right Bill?
peter guillam, Fine. We have tea at Fortnum's every afternoon.
percy alleline,I require the matter of your discussion with Tarr.
peter guillam,I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled.
percy alleline, What's that shrug for?
peter guillam,But I haven't been seeing him! So get your facts straight and get OFF MY BACK!
percy alleline,So if I told you that Tarr had recently arrived in Paris would you be surprised?
peter guillam,Nothing would surprise me about Tarr.
percy alleline,"And if I told you we happen to know that thirty thousand pounds mysteriously appeared in his bank account last month, would that surprise you?"
peter guillam,What for?
percy alleline,"Never mind what for! To muddy the water, that's what for! Spread a whole lot of damn nonsense to get us chasing our tails! The point is this - he's heading for home. The first peep from him you come to the grown-ups, understood? Anyone you see at this table. But not another damn soul!"
mechanic, He's waiting for you.
mendel, Where we off to?
peter guillam,The hotel. I have to see George.
mendel,"Mister Smiley isn't at the hotel, sir. Change of venue."
tarr,"Hello, Mister Guillam, sorry I took so long to come back."
fawn,"Excuse me, sir."
smiley,Ricki's been helping us Peter.  He's been telling us all about his adventures.
peter guillam," He's a double, George! There is no Mole! The whole thing's a pack of lies thought up by Moscow. Karla's bought him for thirty thousand pounds!"
smiley,As you did take the trouble to steal it...
ricki tarr, S'right.
smiley,What was the date?
peter guillam,He doesn't know because there was no telegram! The whole thing...
ricki tarr,November 20th. It would have been November 20th. Evening.
smiley,November 20th is missing.  Someone is covering their tracks Peter. Unless you think that's just a coincidence?
peter guillam,What about the money?
smiley,Thirty thousand isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his Mole. I'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mister Tarr and is doing everything they can to discredit him.
peter guillam," ""Enquiries to the fifth floor."""
smiley,You recognize that handwriting?  That's Toby Esterhase.
peter guillam,Why didn't you tell me? That you had Tarr?
smiley,Secrecy is a habit.
peter guillam,I should get some rest. And I suppose you should get your reading done.
peter guillam,I'm sorry.
smiley,What for?
peter guillam,"I wanted to believe Tarr was lying.  All this time, thinking I'm fighting a war. It's a sham. Karla won years ago and we didn't even know it."
peter guillam, What did he say?
smiley," Think of your wife. You have a wife, don't you? I brought you some cigarettes, by the way."
peter guillam,That was Karla? And he flew back to die rather than give in?
smiley,Yes.  And that's how I know he can be beaten. Because he's a fanatic. And the fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt.
peter guillam,What did he look like?
smiley,That's the thing.  I can't remember.
richard, Nearly done.
roach, Time sir?
prideaux, Got your specs on Jumbo?
roach,"Yes, sir."
prideaux,Who's the fellow down there?
roach, Don't know sir.
prideaux,Who is he? Beggarman? Thief? Why doesn't he look this way? 
class, Best car in England!
belinda,Stop it! Stop it!
kaspar,Keep your bloody hands off her!
scalphunter,"Christ's sake, don't fight over a bit of skirt!"
jerry westerby,"But that's the way it is, George, isn't it? When you're out, you're out. Too much of this stuff."
smiley," I need to talk to you about the night Jim Prideaux was killed, Jerry. You were duty officer, weren't you?"
jerry westerby,"Yes. Control asked me to man the phones that night. Said someone was doing a special job for the service. He wanted someone from outside he could trust. If anything came in, I was to tell him and only him."
jerry westerby," Been a bit of a panic, sir."
jerry westerby,Ann? I'm sorry to bother you. Is George back yet?
smiley,You rang my house?
jerry westerby,Just on the off chance you were back from Berlin.
smiley,What did you say?
jerry westerby,Just that there'd been a bit of a crisis. She said you weren't back yet. That was it.
smiley,Go on.
jerry westerby,"All hell broke loose - military yelling about Hungarian tank movements on the border, Lacon and the Minister baying at the door. Thank Christ Bill Haydon turned up when he did."
bill haydon,Get out.
jerry westerby,I tried to get hold of you...
bill haydon,I just picked up half a story on the ticker-tape at my club... Tell me.
jerry westerby,Jim Prideaux's been shot.
haydon,Get me the Hungarian Embassy.
jerry westerby, Yes sir...
bill haydon,You go and tell your Masters what will happen if one hair on Jim Prideaux's head is damaged...
jerry westerby,Any more news on him?
bill haydon,We need to go to his flat. Clear out anything linked.
peter guillam,Haydon heard the news at his club?
smiley,The Saville.
peter guillam,At one-thirty? The ticker-tape wouldn't be running.
smiley,Peter...
peter guillam,Jesus Christ. Haydon? How could he have known?
smiley,"It's not him, Peter."
peter guillam,Then how did he know?
smiley, Because he was at my house that night. With Ann.
old man,"Just in case it's of interest, dear. We are observed. Old Filth in the bushes. Not very subtle but there you are..."
smiley,Yes. Pleasant enough.
bill haydon,"I was just passing, thought I'd call in. Ann was in bed but she insisted on getting up. She said she'll be down in a minute."
jim prideaux,"Come in, Roach."
roach,Sir there's a stranger parked down on the road. He's just sitting there.
prideaux," It's alright, old fella. Don't cry. Nobody ever watched like you, did they? Off you go, now."
roach,Are you going to have to leave?
jim prideaux,I'll be fine. You get back to bed.
control,You weren't followed?
prideaux,"Andras Benedek, Hungarian journalist based in Paris."
control,"If you're caught, you keep me out of it. You were acting alone, bit of Private Enterprise. Understood?"
prideaux,What information?
control,Rocketry. Ballistics. Bit of politics.
prideaux,What else?
control, Treasure. He has treasure. The name of the Mole Moscow Centre has planted at the top of the Circus.
smiley,Which means I was...?
prideaux,You were Beggarman.
smiley,"What did you make of it, Jim? Control's theory?"
prideaux, I thought it was madness. To think any one of you could have been a traitor... madness.
smiley,But still you went? Risking your life for a mission you thought was absurd? Why?
prideaux, I went because Control asked me to go. It's called doing one's duty.
prideaux,"I held on as long as I could, to give everyone else time to get the hell out of there.  Did they?"
smiley, No. They were blown. The story is you blew them to save your own skin.
prideaux,"The Mole. Control's crazy theory. I was going to bury that so deep, they'd never get it out of me. Which was a joke."
smiley,Why?
prideaux,Because they already knew. They wanted to know how far Control had got in his investigation.
smiley,What else?
prideaux,"Circus gossip. Was Percy's wife still drinking, who was Bland screwing in the office. That sort of thing."
smiley,Did they ask about me at all?
prideaux,One of them did.
smiley,What did he say about me?
prideaux,"He had a cigarette lighter. Kept flashing it round for me to see. Showed me the inscription. ""To George, from Ann. All my love."" He reckoned after Bill's fling with her, she might want to change the inscription."
smiley, That was well said.
prideaux,He gave me a cigarette.
smiley,Jim?
prideaux,I thought it was my last one.
man's voice, Do you know this woman?
prideaux,I don't know her.
irina,I...
peter guillam,Who?
smiley,Toby Esterhase.
smiley,"He gave him a thousand pounds. Told him he was dead now and couldn't come back. Had to become a Lotus Eater - forget everything that happened - Control's theory, Tinker, Tailor... all of it."
peter guillam,You alright?
smiley,"Will you watch my back, Peter? Look out for a solo. Just a feeling I've had."
peter guillam,"Yes, George. I'll watch."
ricki tarr," She said there was a General, work-name Polyakov who was stationed in London. And that Polyakov's real job was to service the mole. He meets him regularly and takes back information the Mole gives him for Karla.  Smiley presses STOP. He presses RE-WIND, watches the tape spool BACKWARDS. He goes too far, presses FAST-FORWARD, watches the tape REVERSE DIRECTION. And, at this moment, we can tell from his expression, a piece of the jig-saw falls into place."
minister,This meeting is not taking place. Is that clear?
smiley,"Perfectly, Minister.  There is a house, somewhere in this city, where Alleline and the others meet Witchcraft's London representative. I need the address of that house."
minister,I don't know what you're talking about.
smiley, You told me to follow in Control's footsteps.
minister," Well, I wouldn't consider that sound advice, after the bloody mess Control left us with. It's taken Alleline - and, if I may say so, myself - this long to get us back into the race."
smiley,I'm glad you take some of the credit.
minister,That's... that's not possible.
smiley,"Made possible. By you. When he steals our secrets he does it under the very nose of the Circus, in the house which you persuaded the treasury to pay for. I'm sure you'll be able to take full credit for that."
minister, Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine! It's been gold!
smiley,"Just enough glitter, amongst the chicken-feed. Control didn't believe in miracles and he didn't believe in Witchcraft. But you were lazy and you were greedy and so you hounded him out of the Circus and you let Karla in."
minister,"Oh God... We can't be made to look like fucking fools again! Forget Europe, if we have the black men getting to hear about this on Walla-Wallah News! What if we find the Mole and we move him sideways, some department where he can't do any harm? Is the Kremlin likely to boast about this?"
lacon,Not in their interests sir. They need the Enemy to look like a threat...
minister,"Well, tell them to play the game. We don't go crowing about their fuck-ups!"
smiley, We are not the prize. We're the bait.
minister,What can we do?
smiley,We have one thing the Mole wants.
ricki tarr,If I go...
peter guillam,You'll go...
ricki tarr,... I want your word you'll get Irina back. Don't care who you have to trade. I want a family. Don't wanna end up like you lot...
smiley," I'll do my utmost, Ricki."
toby esterhase,What... what's this about George?
smiley,"It's about which Master you've been serving, Toby."
smiley,"Intelligence has been leaked, Toby. Someone's been taking files from the Circus..."
toby esterhase,"This is a mistake George, this is all..."
smiley,"The files were delivered to a Russian attache, weren't they?"
toby esterhase,"Yes. And yes, I delivered them."
toby esterhase,... and Bill...
toby esterhase,And Roy...

toby esterhase,Why are we here? Why are we...?
smiley,Who gave you the message for Jim to forget about Tinker Tailor?
toby esterhase,Bland!
smiley,To get rid of Connie Sachs? Westerby?
toby esterhase,Bland or Haydon. I don't remember. One of them. Maybe Percy. I don't know who.

mrs mccraig,Whenever the gentlemen are meeting I record the session. The tapes are sent back to the Circus.
smiley,If you're at all worried you can call Lacon from the basement phone. Let's try the tape recorder shall we?
macklevore," Guest from London Station, Monsieur Fourcade."
mackelvore," The whole service is looking for you, Ricki. They'll skin you alive if they find you."
ricki tarr," Maybe I want them to find me.  Mackelvore frowns. They reach a door which he opens to reveal a STEEL DOOR beyond. He presses a bell and a hatch in the door slides open and a young man's face appears. This is BEN. He slides open a bolt, a double lock, and lets them into a ..."
mackelvore,"You can go home now, Ben. Leave the books where they are and put the keys into the machines. I'll be talking to London presently under my own steam."
ben,Okay boss.
ricki tarr, Ben stays here.
ricki tarr, Ricki Tarr claims to have further information vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.

ricki tarr,Read it aloud.
ben,Personal for Tarr from Alleline...

ricki tarr,"That's the way Percy boy! You keep stalling. I better warn you Ben, there's some lousy people in this outfit. Don't trust a fucking one of them."
smiley,"I'm here, Mendel."
peter guillam,He's here.
oliver lacon,I won't have bloodshed. I want absolute calm!
on guillam," ... as his nerves and excitement and any hope he might have had of a sense of victory DRAINS AWAY, leaving him with just an odd sense of embarrassment and shame."
smiley,I was assured there would be no coercion.
bill haydon,"It's almost funny George. I know the Inquisitors little bag of tricks. I taught most of them. Don't mind the tears. Just a reaction. An over-reaction, if you like. Craddox says I'll be off in a few days. I keep thinking how I'm going to miss the cricket in Moscow."
smiley,If I can.
bill haydon,There's a girl...Would you give her some money for me? Give her a good cover story. If it helps tell her I love her. It's all here.
smiley,Of course.
bill haydon,There's a boy too. Bung him a few quid to shut him up. Take it out of the reptile fund.
smiley,I did have one or two questions. About Prideaux.
bill haydon,"Damn it! I got him back, didn't I?"
smiley,"Yes, yes you did. That was good of you.  I'm surprised Karla didn't shoot him. Or do you think he held back out of delicacy towards you?"
bill haydon,"Yes, as a matter of fact he did."
smiley,To say what?
bill haydon,So did you.
smiley,Did Karla ever consider having you take over the Circus?
bill haydon,I'm not his bloody office boy.
smiley,What are you then?
bill haydon,I'm someone who made his mark.
smiley, Is there anything you want me to pass on to Ann?
bill haydon,"Oh, that was nothing personal, George, I hope you understand that? Karla said you were good, the one we had to worry about. But you do have a blind spot. "
smiley,Up to a point.
smiley," ""Tailor."""
bill haydon, Best days.
roach,I made you something.
prideaux,I don't want you hanging around here. Keep away from me from now on. Go and join the others.
smiley,Shall we begin?
