mayor,"[in his mayor truck] Town meeting, town meeting, town meeting tonight, town meeting tonight"
jack,Listen everyone.  I want to tell you about Christmastown.
jack,"There are objects so peculiar They were not to be believed All around, things to tantalize my brain It's a world unlike anything I've ever seen And as hard as I try I can't seem to describe Like a most improbable dream But you must believe when I tell you this It's as real as my skull and it does exist Here, let me show you"
devil,A box? is it steel?
werewolf,Are there locks?
harleouin demon,Is it filled with a pox?
jack,If you please Just a box with bright-colored paper And the whole thing's topped with a bow
witches,A bow? But why? How ugly What's in it? What's in it?
jack,"That's the point of the thing, not to know"
clown,It's a bat Will it bend?
undersea gal,Perhaps it s the head that I found in the lake
jack,"Listen now, you don't understand That's not the point of Christmas land"
jack,"Um, let me explain There's no foot inside, but there's candy Or sometimes it's filled with small toys"
winged demon,Do they bite?
mummy,Do they snap?
winged demon,Or explode in a sack?
corpse kid,Or perhaps they just spring out And scare girls and boys
mayor,What a splendid idea This Christmas sounds fun I fully endorse it Let's try it at once
jack,"Everyone, please now, not so fast There's something here that you don't quite grasp Well, I may as well give them what they want And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last For the ruler of this Christmas land Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice Least that's what I've come to understand"
jack,There's got to be a logical way to explain this Xmas thing.
jack,Hel-lo
jack,Dr. I need to borrow some equipment.
jack,I'm conducting a series of experiments.
jack,I know.
sally,Hmm.  Experiments?
jack,"Zero, I'm home."
jack,Interesting reaction....but what does it mean?
jack,"Christmas time is buzzing in my skull Will it let me be? I cannot tell There's so many things I cannot grasp When I think I've got it, and then at last Through my bony fingers it does slip Like a snowflake in a fiery grip"
jack,"Eureka!!  This year, Christmas will be ours!"
mayor,"Patience, everyone.  Jack has a special Job for each of us.  Dr. Finkelstein, your Xmas assignment is ready.  Dr. Finkelstein to the front of the line."
vampire,What kind of a noise is that for a baby to make?
jack,Perhaps it can be improved?
vampires,No problem!
jack,I knew it!  Dr. thank you for coming.  We need some of these. [showing picture of Santa and sleigh]
mayor,How horrible our Xmas will be.

shock,"And we thought you didn't like us, Jack. [giggles]"

shock,Jack said we should work together Three of a kind
shock,"First, we're going to set some bait Inside a nasty trap and wait When he comes a-sniffing we will Snap the trap and close the gate"
lock,Wait! I've got a better plan To catch this big red lobster man Let's pop him in a boiling pot And when he's done we'll butter him up
shock,"Then Mr. Oogie Boogie Man Can take the whole thing over then He'll be so pleased, I do declare That he will cook him rare"
lock,I say that we take a cannon Aim it at his door And then knock three times And when he answers Sandy Claws will be no more
shock,"You're so stupid, think now lf we blow him up to smithereens We may lose some pieces And then Jack will beat us black and green"
barrel,"He'll be so pleased by our success That he'll reward us too, I'll bet"
shock,I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb
barrel,I'm not the dumb one
lock,You're no fun
shock,Shut up
lock,Make me
shock,"I've got something, listen now This one is real good, you'll see We'll send a present to his door Upon there'll be a note to read Now, in the box we'll wait and hide Until his curiosity entices him to look inside"
barrel,"And then we'll have him One, two, three"
oogie boogie,Sandy Claws..hahaha
jack,It goes something like this.  [Jingle bells] How about it?  Think you can manage?
mayor,Next!
jack,"Fantastic!  Now why don't you all practice on that and we'll be in great shape.  Sally, I need your help more than anyone's."
sally,"You certainly do, Jack.  I had the most terrible vision."
jack,That's splendid.
sally,"No, it was about your Xmas.  There was smoke and fire."
jack,That not my Xmas.  My Xmas is filled with laughter and joy and this--my Sandy Claws outfit.  I want you to make it.
sally,"Jack, please, listen to me--it's going to be a disaster."
jack,"How could it be--just follow the pattern.  This part is red, the trim is white."
sally,"It's a mistake, Jack."
jack,"Now don't be modest, who else is clever enough to make my Sandy claws outfit."
mayor,Next!
jack,I have every confidence in you.
sally,"But it seems wrong to me, very wrong."
jack,This device is called a nutcracker.
jack,Perfect!  Open it up.  Quickly!
jack,That's not Sandy Claws!
shock,It isn't?
barrel,Who is it?
behemoth,Bunny!
jack,Not Sandy Claws...take him back!

shock,I told you!
jack,Arr!!  [making scary face at LS&B]

lock,"To Oogie boogie, of course.  There isn't anywhere in the whole world more comfortable than that and Jack said to make him comfortable.  Didn't he?"
sandy claws,Haven't you heard of peace on earth and good will toward men?
sally,This'll stop Jack.
sandy claws,Don't do this.  Naughty children never get any presents.
