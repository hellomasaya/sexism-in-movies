Speaker,Dialogue
fargo,a screenplay by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen
clerk,"And how are you today, sir?"
man,Real good now.  I'm checking in - Mr. Anderson.
clerk,"Okay, Mr. Anderson, and you're still planning on staying with us just the night, then?"
anderson,You bet.
news anchor,- whether they will go to summer camp at all.  Katie Jensen has more.
katie,It was supposed to be a project funded by the city council;  it was supposed to benefit those Fargo-Moorehead children who would otherwise not be able to afford to attend a lakeshore summer camp.  But nobody consulted city controller Stu Jacobson...
waitress,Can I warm that up for ya there?
anderson,You bet.
anderson,"I'm, uh, Jerry Lundegaard -"
younger man,You're Jerry Lundegaard?
jerry,"Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -"
younger man,"Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?"
younger man,We been sitting here an hour. I've peed three times already.
jerry,"I'm sure sorry.  I - Shep told me 8:30.  It was a mix-up, I guess."
younger man,Ya got the car?
jerry,"Yah, you bet.  It's in the lot there.  Brand-new burnt umber Ciera."
younger man,"Yeah, okay.  Well, siddown then. I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud."
jerry,"Yah, how ya doin'.  So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?"
younger man,"Sure, Jerry, we're all set.  Why wouldn't we be?"
jerry,"Yah, no, I'm sure you are.  Shep vouched for you and all.  I got every confidence in you fellas."
jerry,"...  So I guess that's it, then. Here's the keys -"
carl,"No, that's not it, Jerry."
jerry,Huh?
carl,"The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars."
jerry,"Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom.  I thought Shep told you -"
carl,"Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry."
jerry,"Well, okay, it's -"
carl,Except that you were gonna be
jerry,"Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then."
carl,"Yeah, you already said that."
jerry,Yah.  But it's not a whole pay- in-advance deal.  I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
carl,"I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry."
jerry,Okay.
carl,I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though:  what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
jerry,"Oh, no, it's real sound.  It's all worked out."
carl,You want your own wife kidnapped?
jerry,Yah.
carl,"...  You - my point is, you pay the ransom - what eighty thousand bucks? -  I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half.  It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -"
jerry,"Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom.  The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off.  Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -"
carl,"What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?"
jerry,"Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money.  Now, her dad's real wealthy -"
carl,So why don't you just ask him for the money?
grimsrud,"Or your fucking wife, you know."
carl,"Or your fucking wife, Jerry."
jerry,"Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that.  And even if they did, I wouldn't get it. So there's that on top, then.  See, these're personal matters."
carl,Personal matters.
jerry,"Yah.  Personal matters that needn't, uh -"
carl,"Okay, Jerry.  You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera."
jerry,Hon?  Got the growshries.
voice,"Thank you, hon.  How's Fargo?"
jerry,"Yah, real good."
voice,Dad's here.
jerry,"How ya doin', Wade?"
wade,"Yah, pretty good."
jerry,Whatcha watchin' there?
wade,Norstars.
jerry,...  Who they playin'?
wade,OOOoooh!
jerry,"Is he stayin' for supper, then?"
wife,"Yah, I think so...  Dad, are you stayin' for supper?"
wade, Yah.
scotty,May I be excused?
jerry,"Sure, ya done there?"
scotty,Uh-huh.  Goin' out.
wife,Where are you going?
scotty,Just out.  Just McDonald's.
scotty,Okay.
wade,He just ate.  And he didn't finish. He's going to McDonald's instead of finishing here?
wife,He sees his friends there.  It's okay.
wade,"It's okay?  McDonald's?  What do you think they do there?  They don't drink milkshakes, I assure you!"
wife,"It's okay, Dad."
jerry,"Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?"
wade,You told me about it.
jerry,"Yah, you said you'd have a think about it.  I understand it's a lot of money -"
wade,A heck of a lot.  What'd you say you were gonna put there?
jerry,A lot.  It's a limited -
wade,I know it's a lot.
jerry,I mean a parking lot.
wade,"Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot - ha ha ha!"
jerry,"Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -"
wade,I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman.  He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
jerry,"Well, you know Stan'll say no dice.  That's why you pay him. I'm asking you here, Wade.  This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -"
wade,Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
grimsrud,Where is Pancakes Hause?
carl,What?
grimsrud,We stop at Pancakes Hause.
carl,"What're you, nuts?  We had pancakes for breakfast.  I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe. Not more fuckin' pancakes.  Come on."
carl,"...  Come on, man.  Okay, here's an idea.  We'll stop outside of Brainerd.  I know a place there we can get laid.  Wuddya think?"
grimsrud,"I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know."
carl,"Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin', we'll stop for pancakes, then we'll get laid.  Wuddya think?"
customer,We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
jerry,"Yah, but that TruCoat -"
customer,I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
jerry,"Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems.  It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -"
customer,"You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles!  You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!"
jerry,"Yah, but this TruCoat -"
customer,"We had us a deal here for nine- teen-five.  You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nine- teen-five!"
jerry,"Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -"
customer,"You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it!  Ready to make delivery, ya says!  Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen-five for this vehicle here!"
jerry,"Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss..."
jerry,"...  See, they install that TruCoat at the factory, there's nothin' we can do, but I'll talk to my boss."
customer,These guys here - these guys! It's always the same!  It's always more!  He's a liar!
wife,"Please, dear."
customer,We went over this and over this -
jerry,So you're goin' to the Gophers on Sunday?
salesman,You bet.
jerry,You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
salesman,They're playin' the Buckeyes!
jerry,Yah.
salesman,Ya kiddin'!
jerry,"Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat."
customer,"One hundred!  You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're a bald-faced liar!"
customer,...  A fucking liar -
wife,"Bucky, please!"
jerry,One hunnert's the best we can do here.
customer,"Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook.  Let's get this over with."
carl,"Oh, Jesus, yeah."

shep,Never heard of him.  Don't vouch for him.
jerry,"Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'.  I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -"
shep,Call 'em up.
jerry,"Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya."
shep,Nope.
jerry,"Okay, well, real good, then."
carl,"...  Look at that.  Twin Cities. IDS Building, the big glass one. Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest. After the Sears, uh, Chicago... You never been to Minneapolis?"
grimsrud,No.
carl,...  Would it kill you to say something?
grimsrud,I did.
carl,"""No."" First thing you've said in the last four hours.  That's a, that's a fountain of conversation, man.  That's a geyser.  I mean, whoa, daddy, stand back, man.  Shit, I'm sittin' here driving, man, doin' all the driving, whole fuckin' way from Brainerd, drivin', tryin' to, you know, tryin' to chat, keep our spirits up, fight the boredom of the road, and you can't say one fucking thing just in the way of conversation."
carl,"...  Well, fuck it, I don't have to talk either, man.  See how you like it..."
carl,...  Total silence...
jerry,"Yah, real good.  How you doin'?"
voice,"Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard. You're damned hard to get on the phone."
jerry,"Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it."
voice,"That's for sure.  Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -"
jerry,"But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -"
voice,"Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month."
jerry,"Yah, so we're all set."
voice,"Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your applicaton.  Maybe if you could just read them to me -"
jerry,"But the deal's already done, I already got the money -"
voice,"Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist."
jerry,"Yah, well, they exist all right."
voice,I'm sure they do - ha ha!  But I can't read their serial numbers here.  So if you could read me -
jerry,"Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -"
voice,"No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -"
jerry,"Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then."
voice,"Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -"
jerry,"Yah, how much money was that?"
voice,"Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars.  See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on."
jerry,"Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then."
voice,"No, no, fax is -"
jerry,I mean send it over.  I'll shoot it right over to ya.
voice,Okay.
jerry,"Okay, real good, then."
host,So I seperate the - how the heck do I get the egg out of the shell without breaking it?
hostess,You just prick a little hole in the end and blow!
host,"Okay, here goes nothing."
audience,Awoooo!
grimsrud,Unguent.
carl,Huh?
grimsrud,I need ... unguent.
jerry,"How ya doin' there, Stan?  How are ya, Wade?"
stan,"Good to see ya again, Jerry.  If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet."
jerry,"Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee."
wade,This is do-able.
stan,"Congratulations, Jerry."
jerry,"Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -"
wade,What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
jerry,...  Huh?
stan,"The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee."
jerry,"...  My fee?  Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?"
wade,Stan and I're okay.
jerry,Yah.
wade,We're good to loan in.
jerry,Yah.
wade,But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
jerry,"No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in.  It's my deal here, see?"
stan,Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
jerry,"Yah, right -"
stan,You're sayin' - what're you sayin'?
wade,You're sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
jerry,"No, no.  I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest - heck, I'd go - one over prime -"
stan,"We're not a bank, Jerry."
wade,"What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal.  Talk to Bill Diehl."
stan,He's at Norstar.
wade,He's at -
jerry,"No, see, I don't need a finder's fee, I need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me.  I need the principal."
stan,"Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars."
wade,"What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security.  Heck, FDIC.  I don't see nothin' like that here."
jerry,"Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back."
wade,"I'm not talkin' about your damn word, Jerry.  Geez, what the heck're you?...  Well, look, I don't want to cut you out of the loop, but his here's a good deal. I assume, if you're not innarested, you won't mind if we move on it independently."
jerry,Hon?
jerry,...  Got the growshries...
jerry,...  Hon?
jerry,"Yah, Wade, I - it's Jerry, I."
jerry,"...  Yah, Wade, it's, I, it's Jerry..."
jerry,"...  Wade, it's Jerry, I - we gotta talk, Wade, it's terrible..."
jerry,"...  Yah, Wade Gustafson, please."
grimsrud,"Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know."
carl,Geez.  That's more'n I've heard you say all week.
carl,"Ah, shit, the tags..."
carl,"...  It's just the tags.  I never put my tags on the car.  Don't worry, I'll take care of this."
carl,"...  Let's keep still back there, lady, or we're gonna have to, ya know, to shoot ya."
carl,...  Hey!  I'll take care of this!
carl,"How can I help you, officer?"
trooper,"This is a new car, then, sir?"
carl,"It certainly is, officer.  Still got that smell!"
trooper,"You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window."
carl,Certainly -
trooper,Can I see your license and registration please?
carl,Certainly.
carl,"...  I was gonna tape up the temporary tag, ya know, to be in full compliance, but it, uh, it, uh ... must a slipped my mind..."
carl,"...  So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd."
trooper,"What's this, sir?"
carl,That's my license and regis- tration.  I wanna be in compliance.
carl,...  I was just thinking I could take care of it right here.  In Brainerd.
trooper,"Put that back in your pocket, please."
trooper,"...  And step out of the car, please, sir."
grimsrud,Shut up.
carl," Whoa...  Whoa, Daddy."
grimsrud,"You'll take care of it.  Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know."
carl,"Whoa, Daddy."
grimsrud,Clear him off the road.
carl,Yeah.

marge,"Thanks, hon.  Time to shove off."
norm,"Love ya, Margie."
marge,"Love ya, hon."
marge,Hon?
norm, Yah?
marge,Prowler needs a jump.
marge,"Hiya, Lou."
lou,Margie.  Thought you might need a little warm-up.
marge,"Yah, thanks a bunch.  So what's the deal, now?  Gary says triple homicide?"
lou,"Yah, looks pretty bad.  Two of'm're over here."
marge,Where is everybody?
lou,"Well - it's cold, Margie."
marge,"Ah, geez.  So...  Aw, geez. Here's the second one...  It's in the head and the ... hand there, I guess that's a defensive wound.  Okay."
marge,...  Where's the state trooper?
lou,Back there a good piece.  In the ditch next to his prowler.
marge,"Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal."
lou,Yah.
marge,I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
lou,Yah.
marge,"Yah.  And I'll tell you what, from his footprints he looks like a big fella -"
lou,"Ya see something down there, Chief?"
marge,"Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf."
lou,"Geez, you okay, Margie?"
marge,I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
marge,"...  Well, that passed."
lou,Yah?
marge,Yah.  Now I'm hungry again.
lou,"You had breakfast yet, Margie?"
marge,"Oh, yah.  Norm made some eggs."
lou,"Yah?  Well, what now, d'ya think?"
marge,Let's go take a look at that trooper.
marge,"There's two of 'em, Lou!"
lou,Yah?
marge,"Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy."
lou,"Oh, yah?"
marge,For Pete's sake.
lou,"How's it look, Marge?"
marge,"Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy.  It's a real shame."
lou,Yah.
marge,"You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?"
lou,No way.
marge,"Somebody shut his lights.  I guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back."
lou,"Yah, woulda been cold out here."
marge,"Heck, yah.  Ya think, is Dave open yet?"
lou,You don't think he's mixed up in -
marge,"No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers."
marge,You look in his citation book?
lou,Yah...
lou,...  Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m. Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
marge,Uh-huh.
lou,So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR. They don't got no match yet.
marge,"I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou."
lou,Yah?
marge,"Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates.  DLR?"
lou,Oh...
lou,...  Geez.
marge,"Yah.  Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?"
lou,"Yah, that's a good one."
marge,Yah.
wade,"-  All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!"
jerry,"No!  They said no cops!  They were darned clear on that, Wade!  They said you call the cops and we -"
wade,"Well, a course they're gonna say that!  But where's my protection? They got Jean here!  I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go."
jerry,"Well, they -"
wade,"A million dollars is a lot a damn money!  And there they are, they got my daughter!"
jerry,"Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade.  Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade."
wade,"Heck, you don't know!  You're just whistlin' Dixie here!  I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this!  I'm sayin' call a professional!"
jerry,"No!  No cops!  That's final!  This is my deal here, Wade!  Jean is my wife here!"
stan,"I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here."
wade,Well -
stan,"We gotta protect Jean.  These - we're not holdin' any cards here, Wade, they got all of 'em.  So they call the shots."
jerry,You're darned tootin'!
wade,"Ah, dammit!"
stan,I'm tellin' ya.
wade,Well...  Why don't we...
wade,"...  Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million."
jerry,"Now come on here, no way, Wade! No way!"
stan,"We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing."
jerry,Yah!
stan,"What's the next step here, Jerry?"
jerry,"They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop.  I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow."
wade,Dammit!
cashier,How was everything today?
jerry,"Yah, real good now."
stan,"Okay.  We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry.  Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?"
jerry,"No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear."
stan,Yah.
jerry,"Ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they'll be watchin', ya know. Maybe it's all bull, but like you said, Stan, they're callin' the shots."
stan,"Okay.  And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?"
jerry,"Yah, geez, Scotty.  I'll go talk to him."
stan,We'll call.
jerry,"...  How ya doin' there, Scotty?"
scott,Dad!  What're they doing?  Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
jerry,"It's okay, Scotty.  They're not gonna want to hurt her any. These men, they just want money, see."
scott,What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
jerry,"No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here. Grandad and I, we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right."
scott,"Dad, I really think we should call the cops."
jerry,"No!  We can't let anyone know about this thing!  We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!"
scott,"Yeah, but -"
jerry,"We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball.  Ya know, that's the deal.  Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty..."
jerry,...  That's the best we can do here.
carl,Hold it.
carl,Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Jesus!
marge,"Hiya, hon."
norm,"Brought ya some lunch, Margie. What're those, night crawlers?"
marge,Yah.
norm,"Thanks, hon."
marge,"You bet.  Thanks for lunch.  What do we got here, Arbie's?"
norm,Uh-huh.
marge,...  How's the paintin' goin'?
norm,Pretty good.  Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
marge,"Aw, hon, you're better'n them."
norm,They're real good.
marge,"They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them."
norm,"Yah, ya think?"
marge,"Ah, ya got Arbie's all o'er me."
lou,"Hiya, Norm, how's the paintin' goin'?"
norm,Not too bad.  You know.
marge,How we doin' on that vehicle?
lou,"No motels registered any tan Ciera last night.  But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank."
marge,"Geez, that's a good lead.  The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?"
lou,"Yah.  Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company."
marge,"Oh, yah?"
marge,Where you girls from?
hooker one,Chaska.
hooker two,LeSeure.  But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
marge,"Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like."
hooker one,"Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking."
marge,In what way?
hooker one,I dunno.  Just funny-looking.
marge,Can you be any more specific?
hooker one,I couldn't really say.  He wasn't circumcised.
marge,Was he funny-looking apart from that?
hooker one,Yah.
marge,"So you were having sex with the little fella, then?"
hooker one,Uh-huh.
marge,Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
hooker one,"No.  Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even."
marge,And what about the other fella?
hooker two,He was a little older.  Looked like the Marlboro man.
marge,Yah?
hooker two,Yah.  Maybe I'm sayin' that cause he smoked Marlboros.
marge,Uh-huh.
hooker two,A subconscious-type thing.
marge,"Yah, that can happen."
hooker two,Yah.
hooker one,They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
marge,"Oh, yah?"
hooker two,Yah.
hooker one,Yah.  Is that useful to ya?
marge,"Oh, you bet, yah."

And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,'  And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'"
gary,Uh-huh.
man,"So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk."
gary,I unnerstand.
man,"And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now.  So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'"
gary,Ya got that right.
man,"And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.'  And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'"
gary,White Bear Lake?
man,"Well, Ecklund && Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption."
gary,Oh sure.
man,"So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in.  End a story."
gary,What'd this guy look like anyways?
man,"Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny-lookin'."

jerry,"Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing."
marge,"Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates.  And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected."
jerry,"Yah, I see."
marge,So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
jerry,"The car's not from our lot, ma'am."
marge,but do you know that for sure without -

jerry,"I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating...  There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can..."
marge,"Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?"
marge,...  Mr. Lundegaard?

marge,"...  Detective Sibert, please..."
woman,"Well, so far we're just saying he's wanted for questioning in connection with a triple homicide.  Nobody at the dealship there's been much help guessing where he might go..."
marge,Uh-huh.
woman,We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
marge,And his wife?
woman,"She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared.  Nobody at his office knows where he is."
marge,Geez.  Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought.  You call his home?
woman,"His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months.  The big C."
marge,"Oh, my."
woman,"And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling.  He's now wanted for assault and parole violation.  He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large."
marge,"Boy, this thing is really ... geez."

detective sibert,"That's wonderful.  Mm-mm.  It'll change your life, a course."
marge,"Oh, yah, I know that!"
detective sibert,"They can really take over, that's for sure."
marge,You have children?
detective sibert,"I thought you'd never ask.  The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan."
marge,"Oh, now he's adorable."
detective sibert,"He's three now.  Course, not in that picture."
marge,"Oh, he's adorable."
detective sibert,"Yah, he -"
marge,Where'd you get him that parka?
detective sibert,Both of these.
marge,"Oh, no, I can't let you do that."
