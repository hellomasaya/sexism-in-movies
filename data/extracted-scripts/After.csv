Speaker,Dialogue
blinding whiteness,We hear a MAN GASPING softly.     Rhythmically. A LUMINOUS PALE SHAPE slowly forms out of the searing whiteness. Gradually we realize we're moving across the ALABASTER BODY of a WOMAN. Her skin translucent.  ON THE WOMAN'S FACE Ethereal.   Her eyes closed.     Her face lifeless.   Then... ...her eyes open. She looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes. This is ANNA  You used to enjoy it. Now it's... He shakes his head.    Frustrated.   Lights a cigarette.  PAUL ...it's like fucking a corpse. Paul immediately realizes he's gone too far.      Turns to Anna.  PAUL Shit.   I'm sorry.   That was-- Anna gets out of bed. Walks towards the bathroom.       Paul puts his head in his hands.
paul,Is this about us?
on anna,her head bowed as she lets the water wash over her.
anna,It's not about us.
anna,I don't know.
anna,I'm happy.
on anna,her nose is bleeding. She touches her lips. Looks impassively at the blood on her fingertips. The SOUND OF WATER carries into the next scene...
tall kid,"You deaf Jack-off? Jack ignores them.   Irritating the Tall Kid even more.  TALL KID Can't fucking speak either. He pushes Jack against the table, toppling the incubator. Panicked, the CHICKS scatter across the surface. Just then the door opens. Anna walks in.  ANNA What's going on? She glances at the Older Boys then at Jack.  ANNA Jack?  JACK Nothing Miss Bryant.  ANNA Nothing? The incubator didn't just fall by itself. The Older Boys stare at Jack.    Waiting for his reaction.  JACK I tripped.   It was an accident. Anna looks at Jack carefully.    She knows he's lying.  ANNA  Jack. Help me clear up. Jack doesn't hear her. He's mesmerized by a SOLITARY CHICK standing motionless in the corner of the incubator.  JACK I think it's dead. Anna reaches in.   Tenderly picks up the chick.  ANNA No.   The poor thing's just scared."
on sink,Startling white. A stream of water flows into the sink. Then after a moment the spiralling clear water gradually turns a deep crimson red.
anna,It's permanent. You can't wash it out.  BEATRICE Then dye it back. You can't show up at the funeral looking like that. Like some prostitute.  ANNA I don't look--  BEATRICE Don't argue with me. Why are you constantly arguing with me? Anna bites her tongue.    Heads to the door.  BEATRICE Where are you going?  ANNA To do the washing up.  BEATRICE The sheets need changing.    They haven't been changed in months.  ANNA I changed them Monday. Anna goes to the cupboard.    Takes out clean sheets.  BEATRICE You weren't here Monday. You never sleep at home anymore. What if something happened to me in the middle of the night?  ANNA Nothing is going to happen to you.  ANYWAY DIANE--  BEATRICE   Fat lot of good she is. I wouldn't have to pay for a Nurse if my only daughter wasn't living in sin with that lawyer of hers. Doing God knows what. They always leave you in the end. You'll see. Just like your father--  ANNA That's enough Mother! Anna dumps the sheets on the bed. As she turns to leave Beatrice's hand darts out and grabs Anna's wrist.  BEATRICE That's it.     Go and cry to Paul. 
anna,Fine.   She sends her condolences.
anna,"No.   I'm fine. Everything's fine. But we can see in her eyes that everything's not fine. Mrs. Hutton nods, then turns to greet another MOURNER. Anna steps nervously up to the coffin."
anna's pov,James Hutton lies peacefully amongst the velvet trimming. Suddenly his LIPS PART... as he GASPS SOFTLY.
viewing room,Anna steps back terrified. Stares at Hutton. His face serene again. It must have been her imagination. She glances up quickly. Embarrassed. Eliot's still observing her.     He nods to her cordially.
eliot's pov,Anna's by her car rummaging in a bag for her keys. Getting increasingly frustrated.
paul,What?    You always have the duck here.  ANNA  Actually there is something I need to talk to you about. Now Anna's nervous.  PAUL I've been offered a transfer to head office in Chicago. Anna looks down.   Stares at her hands on the table. 
paul,It'll mean more work of course. More responsibility. A lot of changes. But it's an incredible opportunity. I'd be crazy to turn it down. And...   Jesus. Can't we just have one fucking meal without arguing--  ANNA Fuck you! The other DINERS turn and stare at them. Paul glances at them embarrassed. Anna doesn't notice. Upset. 
paul,"Keep your voice down, everyone's watching.  ANNA  FUCK YOU!  PAUL You're crazy. You know that?      Just like your mother.  ANNA I'm nothing like my mother! Anna grabs her coat.   Pushes her way through the restaurant.  PAUL   I'm not running after you this time Anna.  ANNA Good. Paul's suddenly aware that everyone's looking at him. He quickly sits down. Drains his glass of wine. Furious."
anna's car,She hesitates.       For a moment we think she might go back to him...
anna,Where am I? She talks with difficulty.       Her breathe labored.
eliot,You're in a funeral home.
eliot,You had a car accident. It was raining. You hit a truck loaded with metal pipes. She looks fearfully at the bloodied dress in Eliot's hand.
anna,I'm not dead.
eliot,You were pronounced dead eight hours ago. Your blood no longer circulates through your body. Your brain cells are slowly dying. Your body's already decomposing.
anna,I'm not dead. Eliot looks at her sadly for a moment. He places the bloodied dress on the trolley. Then picks up a document. Holds it up for her.
on document,It's Anna's death certificate.
eliot,"You were dead on arrival. The attending physician signed here...  ...at 9.45 last night. I picked up your body from the hospital morgue at 12.10 this morning. Anna stares with horror at her death certificate, then at Eliot. He looks away. It pains him to see her so distressed."
eliot,I'm sorry. Eliot picks up a sponge from the trolley.   Wets it.
anna,Who are you? Eliot delicately washes Anna's face. She doesn't flinch as he dabs the wound above her eye brow.
anna,Don't touch me! Why are you touching me?
eliot,I'm preparing your body. You have to look beautiful for your funeral.
anna,I'm not dead. Eliot sighs wearily.   As if he'd had this conversation many times before.
eliot,You all say the same thing.
on anna,The lights go off. O.S. the door clicks shut as it locks automatically behind Eliot.
old guy,Just burn it. You can't send them back one shoe. It's not respectful.
paul,Oh hi.   I'm looking for Anna Bryant. The Teacher quickly moves over.    Hustles Paul to the door.  TEACHER   She didn't come in today. Jack's in the front row.   Following the conversation.  PAUL Did she call in sick?  TEACHER She hasn't called in at all. It's not like her. She always calls in. Paul's worried now.   Something's wrong.
eliot,"Then why are you here? Anna doesn't know what to say.   She turns her head away. A tear falls down her cheek.  ANNA Please. Just let me go. I won't go to the police. I won't tell anyone. Eliot moves her head back.   Gently wipes away her tear.  ELIOT You're still in denial. You have to trust me. I'm only here to help you. Eliot slides a wooden head-rest under her neck and studies her wounds, touching them delicately. Thinking about how to conceal them. He turns to a tray of instruments. Picks up a needle. Leans over Anna. The needle pierces her brow. Sliding cleanly through her skin. She doesn't feel any pain as Eliot carefully sews the wound. He's meticulous. Clearly very good at his job. Eliot glances at his watch. Picks up a SYRINGE and an AMPOULE OF AMBER LIQUID. Draws up the amber liquid. Anna's alarmed. She tries to pull back.  ELIOT Don't be scared.  ANNA What are you doing?  ELIOT This will relax your muscles. Stop the rigor mortis setting in so I can work on your body. He INJECTS Anna in the neck. Just then we hear a car pull up on the gravel driveway outside.  ELIOT   Your mother's early. Anna's eyelids feel very heavy. Slowly her eyes close. Eliot pulls the white sheet over her body."
eliot,I'm so very sorry Mrs. Bryant. It's always so tragic when you lose a child.  BEATRICE I lost her years ago. He glances at her curiously.    Then gestures to his office.  ELIOT If you'd care to come to my office we can discuss the arrangements.  BEATRICE I want to see her.  ELIOT But she hasn't been--  BEATRICE I don't care. I want to see her. It takes him a second to respond.  ELIOT Of course.
beatrice,It's us who are left behind. It's us who suffer.   Who's going to look after me now? Did you think about that? She nods to Diane.    Diane helps her into the wheelchair.  ELIOT I'll confirm the date with Father Graham this afternoon. Friday as you requested.  BEATRICE Just do what you think's best.   It's just details. Beatrice whirs towards the door.      She suddenly stops. Turns to Eliot.  BEATRICE Oh there is one thing.  ELIOT Yes?  BEATRICE Her hair. She was a brunette.    I'd like it back to that color.
paul's pov,Beatrice's car pulls up. Diane gets out.      Pulls the wheelchair out of the car.
paul's car,Paul grabs the flowers.
paul,Mrs. Bryant. Beatrice doesn't acknowledge him.   Paul turns to Diane.  PAUL Hi Diane.   I need to talk to Anna. Diane can't look him in the eye.  PAUL What's wrong?  DIANE I think you better come in.
paul,No. She can't be dead.    There must be some mistake.  BEATRICE There's no mistake. We just got back from the funeral home. Beatrice pushes a joystick on her wheelchair.   As she whirs past Paul she notices the flowers.  BEATRICE   Flowers? How appropriate. Paul's not listening anymore.   Stunned.  PAUL Why didn't you call me?  BEATRICE You took her away from me.   I don't want you anywhere near her.
anna,I must be in shock.     That's all.   It's just shock. She struggles to her feet. Stumbles groggily to the door. Tries the door handle. It's locked. She bangs on the door feebly. Then she hears something. She cocks her head. Follows the sound of Eliot's footsteps upstairs.  ANNA   Let me out!
eliot's pov,Paul stands in the middle of the driveway staring blankly at the Funeral Home.
paul,I'm Anna Bryant's fiance.  ELIOT That's strange. She wasn't wearing an engagement ring.  PAUL Well not quite fiance...  ELIOT I'm very sorry for your loss Mr. Conran.  PAUL I'd like to see her.  ELIOT I'm afraid the viewing isn't until--  PAUL I'd need to see her now.    If that's possible.  ELIOT I'm sorry. It's not possible.     You're not family and--  PAUL Please.   It'd only take a minute.  ELIOT I understand. But--  PAUL  NO.   YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
eliot,Mr. Conran.  There really is nothing I can do. I'm so sorry. Paul looks defeated. He simply nods his head.     Eliot watches him get into his car and drive away.
eliot,Because it would only hurt you. You have to let go of the living. Just like they have to let go of you.  ANNA I don't believe you.   Why are you doing this to me? He shakes his head as he drops the towel into a small bin.  ELIOT You're all the same. You all blame me for your death. As if it were my fault.  ANNA No. You drugged me.    So my mother  WOULDN'T--  ELIOT The others. They just see you as a dead body on a slab. Only I can see you as you really are.  ANNA You're crazy! Eliot's taken aback.    Hurt.  ELIOT I'm a busy man. I don't have time for this. He heads to the door. Pulls out his keys and unlocks it. Just then he remembers something. Turns to her.  ELIOT Oh I nearly forgot.    How tall are you?  ANNA What!? He looks her up and down.   Gauging her height.  ELIOT Five seven.  ANNA Why..?  ELIOT I need to know how tall you are.   For your coffin. Anna's stunned. Eliot looks at her for a moment.     Then switches off the main lights. 
anna,Wait! He ignores her.   The door CLICKS shut behind him.
on newspaper,Schoolteacher Dies in Tragic Car Crash.
jack,I waited. His mother doesn't respond.
paul,"Come on. He pushes the button repeatedly.   Then angrily slams the side of the machine. Nothing.  PAUL You piece of shit. As Paul turns away, he notices a door with a sign on it: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. Paul glances around. Then quickly walks over to the door."
anna's car,Glass everywhere. Paul glances at the KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD DOLL on the dashboard flecked with blood. He places his hands on the steering wheel. Suddenly he hears a strange noise. He looks up... The KITSCHY DOLL. Its head NODDING SLOWLY. Its smiling face now unnaturally sinister. Turning towards us until it abruptly stops. Staring straight at us. Paul looks at the doll transfixed. Just then a PALE WOMAN'S HAND slowly reaches through the window... and touches Paul's shoulder. He jumps. Turns. ANNA stands by the car. Staring blankly at him.   The color drains from Paul's face.
garage,Paul gets out awkwardly.    He can't look Tom in the eye.
tom,You OK?
tom,I just found out. I'm so sorry Paul.       If you need anything--
paul,I need to see Anna.
paul,The funeral director won't let me see her Tom. He says I'm not family. Can you talk to him? Put some pressure on him.
tom,I can't do that.
paul,Tom.    You're my friend.
tom,Paul.     I can't do it. Paul nods slowly.    Tom notices the Kitschy Doll.
tom,You sure you're OK?
paul,I fucked up.
tom,Paul. It was an accident. You should get some rest. Let me drive you home.
paul,I always fuck everything up.
prep room,Eliot opens a cabinet full of boxes of hair dye with photographs of smiling women. As he prepares the dye he looks across at Anna. She's staring at something behind him. Eliot turns. Sees the uncovered body of the Old Woman on the gurney. He quickly walks over. Carefully pulls the white sheet over the Old Woman.
anna,Who is she?
eliot,Mrs. Whitehall. He mixes the dye in a bowl as he moves over to Anna.
eliot,You shouldn't be afraid of her.   The dead can't harm the dead.
anna,Stay where you are.
eliot, Give me the scissors. I only want to help you.
anna,Don't come any closer.     I swear to God I'll kill you. Eliot walks right up to her.     His face now inches from hers.
eliot,Go on.
prep room,For a moment we think she might do it.      But then she wavers.
eliot,What are you waiting for? Anna's confidence falters. She slowly lowers her hand. The scissors fall onto the floor. Anna looks down defeated. Her breath labored. Suddenly she realizes...
anna,I'm breathing!  Look. I'm still alive!
eliot,"You think you're still alive because you're still attached to life. It's normal. You're just imagining you still have symptoms of life. She's not listening. Eliot takes a roll of paper towels. Kneels down, picks up the bowl of dye and mops up the mess."
anna,Maybe I was in some kind of coma. The doctors made a mistake. They're always making mistakes.
eliot,You died.   Everyone dies.
anna,How can I be dead if we're talking? He stands up.    Sighs wearily.  ELIOT We're talking not because you're alive. But because I have a gift.   No.    Please. I don't want--  ELIOT You're a corpse. Your opinion doesn't count anymore. 
anna,"But I can breathe.     I must be alive. She weakly pushes him away. Anger flashes across Eliot's face, but just as quickly he controls it.  ELIOT You people. You all think that if you breathe, shit, piss you're alive. Anna doesn't know what to say.  ELIOT You clutch onto life as if your life was worth clutching onto. Was your life worth clutching onto Anna? Anna turns her head away.   Clearly he's struck a chord.  ELIOT Was it?   Maybe you died a long time ago. Eliot rips off his latex gloves.    Tosses them into a bin.  ELIOT I have to tell you I'm surprised you're still arguing with me. You don't have much time left.  Look. She's accepted her death. Her life has been examined. She has no more regrets. And now she's at peace. She used her time well. You still have so much to learn.  ANNA I have nothing to learn!  ELIOT Are you sure? Eliot stands in the doorway. He switches off the light. His body silhouetted by the light from the hallway.  ELIOT Your funeral's in three days. Soon you'll be enclosed in a coffin. Then buried in the ground. No-one will hear you then. No-one will talk to you there. The door clicks shut behind him. Anna doesn't move. Clearly unsettled by Eliot's words. After a moment she looks at the Old Woman. She moves over. Hesitantly pulls away the white sheet. Stares at the Old Woman curiously. Then tentatively touches her cheek.  ANNA Are you cold? "
anna,I'm so cold. Anna notices the Old Woman's plastic ankle tag.
anna,You had a long life. Anna turns back.   Studies the Old Woman's serene face.
anna,You look so peaceful.
anna,I'm scared.    I'm so scared.
on paul,The music's strangely distorted now.        Almost silent.   As if we were inside Paul's head.
prep room,Anna reaches forward. Her hand disappears into the thick blackness. She snatches her hand back. Scared. Then... ...a CHILD'S HAND darts out of the darkness. Grabs Anna's wrist. Pulling her in with surprising strength. Anna struggles to free herself. But the hand drags her deeper into the darkness. The door slams shut behind her.
on casket,The Old Woman.   Her long hair braided.   She looks serene.
eliot, Can I help you? Jack steps back timidly.   Eliot looks up.   Smiles.
eliot,Then perhaps you can help me.  Could you throw these away for me? Jack nods hesitantly.   Moves over and takes the flowers.
eliot,Thank-you. Eliot turns and arranges fresh flowers in the vase.
on jack,as he looks at the wilted flowers.    He crushes a petal then sniffs his fingers.
viewing room,Jack looks up.   Eliot's watching him carefully.
eliot,They belong in the garbage. Jack turns to leave.
eliot,I've seen you round here before. Jack's suddenly nervous.
eliot,Did you know Mrs. Whitehall?
jack,I thought it was Miss Bryant's funeral.
eliot,Ah. Miss Bryant. No.       Her funeral's not until Friday.
jack,Where is she now? Eliot considers the question for a moment.
eliot,She's downstairs.  JACK Why?  ELIOT Why?  Because she's not ready.   What do you mean? Eliot finished arranging the flowers.     He glances at his watch. Smiles at Jack.  ELIOT It was a pleasure talking to you Jack. 
anna,  Maybe you are God.  ELIOT You'll be at peace soon.     I promise. For a moment we see a deep sadness in Eliot's eyes. He's conflicted. But then abruptly he pulls himself together. Moves away and starts clearing up. Anna closes her eyes. Hugs her legs closer to her chest.  ANNA Paul. She lets out a DESPONDENT SIGH.   The SIGH carries into the next scene...
paul's pov,Anna stands in front of the shower with her back to him. She slips off her bathrobe and hangs it on a hook. Then her hand moves to her chest. There's a STRANGE WET SUCKING sound... ...as Anna rips out her heart and hangs it casually on the hook next to her bathrobe.
anna,What's that?
eliot,"It's your dress. For your funeral. Your mother brought it round this morning. As Eliot takes out a pair of shiny black shoes from a plastic bag, Anna moves haltingly over to the dress. She touches the material puzzled."
anna,This isn't my dress.  This is my mother's dress! It was supposed to be for her funeral. Why has she given it to me? Eliot starts folding the plastic bag. He notices something else inside. He opens the bag. Hesitates then takes something out.
prep room,Eliot looks at it for a moment. Then glances over at Anna. She's still staring at the dress. He opens a drawer beneath the counter. It's full of rosaries and printed Holy cards. He quickly drops the rosary into the drawer. Closes it. Then turns back to Anna.
anna,It should have been her not me.  She was the one dying. Not me. Eliot unlocks the door. Jams it open with a door stop. Slips his keys back into his jacket pocket. Takes off his jacket and hangs it up. He moves over to a collapsible gurney folded on the floor. Bends down and snaps open the side-rails. Anna looks at the open door.
anna,I'm not ready to die. Eliot looks up at Anna sadly.
eliot,Why are you still struggling?
eliot,"There's nothing out there for you anymore. As Eliot turns back to the gurney, Anna notices Eliot's jacket hanging beside her. Realizes the KEYS are in the pocket. She quickly glances back at Eliot. He's still busy adjusting the gurney. She leans over to his jacket."
on eliot,as he gets up and turns to Anna.
prep room,Anna looks at him calmly. We can't tell if she managed to get his keys or not. Eliot pulls on his jacket and wheels the gurney through the door. He steps back into the room. Nudges the door stop away with his foot.
eliot,I'll be back soon. The door locks behind him with a CLICK.
anna's pov,Eliot's van pulls up in front of the house.
entrance hall,Anna's trapped. We hear the CRUNCH of Eliot's footsteps on the gravel outside. Anna looks round desperately.
hallway,Eliot turns towards her... then at the last moment changes his mind. Heads in the opposite direction towards the viewing room.
anna,Paul. Suddenly the light comes on.
eliot,I'm the only one who can hear you now. Anna drops the phone. Backs away towards a window.      Eliot walks over and calmly replaces the phone.
eliot,I'd be very careful if I were you. The dead have such a hold over the living.
anna,What do you mean?
eliot," He still feels your presence. You're only causing him more pain. If you really loved him, you'd accept your death and let him go."
anna,Then prove to me I'm really dead.
eliot,You people.   You always need proof. Eliot places his hands on her shoulders.    Turns her towards a tall mirror.
on mirror,A PALE CADAVEROUS WOMAN. Sunken eyes.      A blood-stained tear in the side of her RED SLIP.
upstairs room,Anna's stunned. She moves closer to the mirror.      Touches her reflection through a thin layer of dust.
anna,Why do I look like a corpse?
eliot,Because you are a corpse.
on mirror,Anna stares blankly at her image in the mirror.
anna,I am dead.
upstairs room,Eliot smiles. Like a father proud of his child's first step. Just then he notices something outside. We see a brief flicker of unease in Eliot's eyes.
eliot's pov,Jack stands in the driveway holding his bicycle.    Looking up at the Funeral Home. Transfixed.
jack's pov,Anna in her RED SLIP by the mirror. She looks frightening in the harsh light. Deathly pale. Like a ghost.
driveway,Strangely Jack isn't scared. He continues staring up at the window. Calmly. Curiously.
old guy,Well here he is. Frank Merano. The Old Guy hands Eliot a clipboard. The Assistant unties the rope. Pulls the plastic sheeting away.
on body,"FRANK , the top half of his head has been flattened. His head split open. Grotesquely distorting his face."
morgue,Eliot glances at the Assistant with disdain. Signs the release form and hands the clipboard back to the Old Guy.
paul, I can't help her anymore. Paul turns and walks away.    Jack grabs his arm.  JACK Maybe you just don't love her anymore? Paul turns and hits Jack with the back of his hand.     Jack falls to the ground. Paul stands over him enraged.  PAUL You little fuck. You think this is funny? He's about to hit Jack again when a STOCKY TEACHER grabs him. Paul tries to struggle loose.  STOCKY TEACHER Hey! The CHILDREN stare at Paul. A SECURITY GUARD runs across talking into a walkie-talkie. Another TEACHER bends down.  TEACHER Are you alright sweetie? Jack nods numbly. Looking up all the time at Paul.      The Security Guard grabs Paul's arm.  SECURITY GUARD The police are on their way. Paul watches Jack stand shakily.   Realizes what he's done. He reaches out to Jack.  PAUL Jack... I'm sorry...  SECURITY GUARD Step back sir.
anna's pov,Frank stares back at her with open dull eyes. His face partially reconstructed with plaster of Paris.
prep room,Eliot smooths the wax over the plaster to give Frank's face a more natural texture. Then picks up a piece of wire with a fishhook-like barb at each end.
eliot,"His mouth.   To keep it closed. Eliot imbeds one barb into the upper gum then pries back Frank's lower lip. He attaches the other barb into the lower gum, then twists the wires tightly together. He picks up two plastic caps covered in small knobs.  ELIOT Now his eyes. He inserts the caps into Frank's eyes. Pulls his eyelids over them. Glues the eyelids together.  ANNA Is this how you'll prepare my body? Eliot looks at her for a moment.   Smiles reassuringly.  ELIOT No. There's no need. I had to rebuild his face. You're still beautiful.  ANNA Does he have family?  ELIOT Yes.    A brother. He's coming in later. Anna touches the white sheet covering Frank's body.  ANNA My mother... She didn't cry did she? When she came to see me?  ELIOT  No.    He didn't cry. We see a brief flicker of pain in Anna's eyes. "
anna,I knew he wouldn't.     He always got upset when I cried.     He said crying never helped. Anna suddenly looks very weary. She leans heavily against the slab. As if she's about to fall.  ELIOT You should rest. He guides her back to the slab.    Helps her lie down.  ELIOT You're getting weaker.    It's almost time. Eliot strokes her hair tenderly.    She looks up at him.  ANNA Can I ask you something?  ELIOT Yes.   Of course.  ANNA Why do we die? A long beat.  ELIOT To make life important. Anna's fingers curl around his hand. Like a vulnerable child. Totally trusting in him. Eliot looks down at Anna sadly. We sense he's conflicted. Confused. Wavering. But then reluctantly he reaches for a SYRINGE filled with AMBER LIQUID on the steel trolley. He injects her gently in the neck. Watches over her for a moment. Then moves to the window. He picks up a window pole. Pulls the shutter across the window plunging the room into darkness.
on polaroid,"The Old Woman, Mrs. Whitehall, lying in her casket."
room,Suddenly Eliot looks up sharply.   As if someone had spoken to him.
eliot,Think nothing of it Mr. Houseman.    No need to apologize. Eliot moves over to the wall.
eliot,I really enjoyed our time together. We pull back slowly. Eliot's talking to a POLAROID of an OLD MAN. We pull back further... the wall's covered in HUNDREDS OF POLAROIDS of BODIES in open coffins. Most of them have closed eyes but we glimpse some with their eyes wide open. Eerily staring at us. Eliot touches the Polaroid of a YOUNG MAN. We see the fear in the Young Man's eyes.
eliot's pov,A POLICE OFFICER stands at the front door.    A SQUAD CAR parked on the driveway.
eliot's room,Eliot steps back.    Calmly continues to dry his hands.
vincent,Something's not right here.
eliot, Not right? Vincent nods towards Frank's body.
vincent,"His smile.    It was a bit more... Vincent raises his fingers to his mouth, trying to find the right word."
vincent,...smiley.
eliot,Smiley.
vincent,That's much better. Thank-you.
eliot,I'm glad I could help.
vincent,Do you mind if I have a couple of minutes alone with him? Eliot hesitates.      Then smiles.
eliot,"No.   Not at all. I'll wait outside. As Eliot leaves, Vincent looks at Frank's body. After a moment he glances at Anna again. Then at the door. He quickly moves over to Anna. Looks at her curiously then pulls down the sheet. He reaches over... and CARESSES HER BREAST. Mesmerized by her naked body. As Vincent's hand moves down her body, he bumps against the trolley. Instruments CRASH to the floor. He pulls back the sheet just as Eliot enters the room."
vincent,I'm sorry.    I didn't see...
vincent,Well. I guess I should be off then. I'll see you at the service. Thanks again. Vincent glances one last time at Anna then leaves. The door locking shut behind him. Eliot stares at the door.
eliot,I just told you. That was your brother.  You had an accident. You're dead. Why do you people never listen to me? Frank doesn't move.    His mouth still wired shut.
eliot,No.   It's not a gift.   It's a curse. Eliot picks up a compact. Roughly layers Frank's cheeks with thick rouge. With every word he gets more agitated.
eliot,I take care of each of you as if you were my children. I wash the shit from your bodies. I dress you. I do everything to make you look more beautiful than when you were alive. And what do you do? Eliot's extremely irritated now.     He grabs a garish red lipstick. Smears Frank's lips.
eliot,You argue with me. As if it were my fault you're dead. As if I was to blame.  What? You're not talking to me now? You don't want to?
prep room,From Eliot's reaction it seems as if Frank has started to talk again.
eliot,No. Now I don't want to talk to you anymore.
jack's pov,Frank Merano lies nestled in the velvet interior.    His face placid. No sign of the gaudy make-up.
viewing room,Jack stares in fascination at Frank's body. He reaches into the casket. Touches Frank's cold hand. In the b.g. Eliot walks into the viewing room.     He stops surprised. Watches Jack intently.
viewing room,Jack turns quickly.    Eliot stands over him.
eliot,You have empathy with the dead. You're drawn to them. Just as they're drawn to you. It's a rare gift. Jack can't look Eliot in the eye.  ELIOT I know you saw Anna. Jack hesitates.   Then nods his head.  ELIOT You're frightened by it. I was scared too the first time. But you shouldn't be. Christ had the same gift. He raised Lazarus and spoke to the dead.  JACK   I can help you. I can teach you.
anna,"Your fingernails are dirty. Eliot smiles.    Examines his nails.  ANNA Your hands are normally so clean.  ELIOT I've been gardening. He walks over to the sink.      Scrubs his nails.  ANNA Is it sunny outside? Eliot fills a bowl with water.     Carries it to the slab.  ELIOT Yes.    The tulips love the sun.  ANNA I miss the sun. Anna glances up at the shuttered window. Eliot snaps on his latex gloves. Picks up a sponge and wets it in the bowl of water. Anna turns to the tulips.  ANNA Are they your favorite flower?  ELIOT Tulips?    Yes. I think so. Eliot raises Anna's arm. Delicately washes her armpit. Along the length of her arm. Her skin pale.  ANNA I thought it'd be lilies. White lilies. Don't they symbolize death?  ELIOT No.    They symbolize purity. He moves to her breasts, following the contours of her body. Pausing every now and then to rinse the sponge.  ANNA And tulips? Eliot hesitates for a second before replying.  ELIOT Unrequited love.   What's your favorite flower? "
anna,"Violets. Eliot softly washes her legs.  ELIOT A beautiful flower.       They need shade and lots of water.  ANNA What do they symbolize?  ELIOT Faithfulness.  ANNA   Do they? Eliot puts down the sponge.      Dries her body with a towel.  ANNA Roses are red, violets are blue... He reaches over to the CD player to switch it off.  ANNA No.     Leave it on.    It's so peaceful. Eliot smiles.   Leaves the music on."
street,The light's turned green. The DRIVERS HONK angrily. Paul doesn't hear them. He places his hand against the plate glass. Stunned.
eliot,Maybe you just want to believe he saw her.  PAUL Fuck you. Paul pushes past Eliot and strides into the Funeral Home.  ELIOT Mr. Conran!
paul,I'm here Anna.   I'm sorry. Please Anna. He places the palm of his hand against the door.
paul,I can't live without you. Eliot looks up at Paul with sudden interest.
paul,Anna! Eliot gently puts his hand on Paul's shoulder.  ELIOT Mr. Conran.   She's dead. Paul pushes him away.  ELIOT I know what you're going through. Denial's a natural part of grieving...
paul,She needs my help. Eliot looks at him for a moment.  ELIOT You can't help her anymore.    Believe me.
tom,Anna was in a car accident. Her car was wrecked Paul. Remember? It's downstairs.  PAUL She's not dead. Tom calmly gets up. Moves to a filing cabinet.   Takes out a file. Hands it to Paul.  TOM Here's the Coroner's report. Paul manically rifles through the file.  PAUL Look.  I saw her. Paul turns hopefully. Finally someone believes him. Vincent Merano stands by Jeff's desk.  VINCENT She was on the slab.     Dead. 
paul,"No!  VINCENT I've seen dead bodies.       Believe me, she was definitely dead.  PAUL Tom. Just go down there and check the place out.  TOM On what grounds Paul?       Do you have any evidence?  PAUL No.     But--  TOM Do you have anything? Paul hesitates.    We sense his uncertainty.  PAUL I think she called me.  TOM Called you?  PAUL   On the telephone. Jeff snickers. Paul's beginning to realize how absurd this all sounds.  VINCENT Collect or long distance? Jeff snorts with laughter.  TOM First you hit a fucking kid. Then you attack Deane. And now you're telling me your dead girlfriend called you? What the fuck's going on? You're loosing it Paul. Merano and Jeff shake their heads, looking at Paul as if he were crazy. Tom's voice softens.  TOM I know you feel guilty but you've got to pull yourself together. Paul slumps in the chair.       Rubs his face. "
paul,Maybe you're right.    But why won't he let me see her? Tom signals to Merano and Jeff. Merano walks back to his desk. Jeff turns back to his work.  TOM Look Paul. The funeral's tomorrow. You'll see her then. It'll help. It will give you closure. Trust me.
anna,I don't fucking know!  ELIOT  WHAT DID YOU WANT ANNA?  ANNA   When I was a child... my mother. Anna struggles to pull together her thoughts.  ANNA When I was a child. I learnt that love. That when you love someone. You get hurt. So I learned not to love. That way no one could ever hurt me again. She looks down at the slab.     Touches the cold marble.  ANNA I was always pushing Paul away.      He thought I didn't love him.  ELIOT Did you?  ANNA He was the only one I ever loved. But I never told him that. And then he stopped loving me. Eliot stares at her intently.    Comes to a decision.  ELIOT What would you do if you had another chance? Anna's puzzled. Eliot goes to the door and unlocks it. Moonlight floods in from upstairs. Washing it with a cold light. Anna doesn't move. 
eliot,Well?   Isn't this what you wanted? Eliot holds out his hand.   Anna takes it hesitantly and rises from the slab.
funeral home,Paul strains to open the window when suddenly... he's caught in a circle of bright light. Paul turns quickly. A DARK FIGURE stands over him. Menacing.
man's voice,What the fuck are you doing here? The Figure lowers the flashlight.   It's Tom.
tom,I'm taking you home.
on anna,Her eyes still closed.
on eliot,Eliot pauses.   Too confused to look back at her.
eliot,It's...   It's not important. He closes the door.
eliot,You have to look beautiful for your funeral. He picks up a SYRINGE and an ampoule of AMBER LIQUID. Fills the syringe.
on ampoule,We glimpse the label: HYDRONIUM BROMIDE.
eliot,This is how they'll all remember you.
anna,Can I see myself for the last time? Eliot smiles.    Picks up a mirror.    Hands it to Anna.
on mirror,Anna looks peaceful.    Beautiful.    Serene.
anna,Is this the end?
prep room,"Eliot glances anxiously at the fogged mirror, then at Anna."
anna,You lied to me.
eliot,Anna. We've been through this before. You're just imagining--
anna,You lied to me. Eliot injects her in the side of the neck. Anna tries to raise her hand to push him away but she's too weak.
on anna,...delicately closes Anna's eyelids.  ELIOT  Good bye Anna.
on casket,Anna lies in an open casket. Her eyes closed.     She can hear the DISTORTED VOICE of the Priest.
viewing room,"Eliot gestures to Beatrice. Diane wheels her to the casket. Beatrice looks at Anna for a moment, then touches the violets in Anna's hands."
diane,Violets. They were her favorite flowers.  How did you know?
eliot,Violets just seemed appropriate somehow.
paul's pov,Anna looks serene.
viewing room,Paul takes out the ring box from his pocket. Gently slides the engagement ring onto Anna's stiff finger. Suddenly he looks alarmed. Turns quickly to Tom.
paul,She's so cold. Paul turns back to Anna.    Tears prick his eyes. He touches her cheek again.    Finally accepting her death.
paul,I'm sorry Anna. He kisses her lips. Eliot watches him carefully. It's almost as if he's jealous. Jack notices Eliot's look then turns and stares at Paul. As Paul and Tom walk away Eliot closes the casket. Begins to screw down the lid.
on coffin,A drop of blood falls onto the polished wood.
viewing room,Eliot stares at the blood for a moment. Takes out a pristine white handkerchief. Carefully wipes off the blood. Then places his hand on the coffin.
paul,Yeah.   Thanks Tom. Tom squeezes Paul's shoulder then walks away.
on polaroids,We pan slowly across the other photographs we saw before. But now we look at them differently. In some faces there is the glimmer of life. In some a despairing pleading look. In others passive resignation.
eliot's room,Eliot moves towards the window.
eliot's pov,The dark cemetery. In the distance flickering candles illuminate Anna's grave.
eliot,They've said their good byes and gone back to their TV dinners and shopping malls. Thinking that this is never going to happen to them. Until it's their turn to be buried. Think about it Anna... Eliot glances at his watch.
eliot,...think about it while you still can.
jack,I never said she was alive.     I just said I saw her. Paul simply nods his head.        Too drained of emotion to react.
paul,You need a ride? Jack shakes his head.
paul,OK.   See you. Paul opens the car door.
jack,Mr. Conran?
jack's pov,Eliot stands in the window smiling at him.
eliot,"Wasn't she? Eliot's suddenly tired of Paul's allegations.  ELIOT Mr. Conran. You come to my Funeral Home, making wild accusations. You have no idea what happens when someone dies. What happens to their body. What happens to their soul.   You twisted fuck. The room's SILENT. Everyone turns towards Paul.   Eliot whispers in Paul's ear.  ELIOT You don't have much time left. Father Graham puts his hand on Paul's arm.  FATHER GRAHAM Please.   Paul. You're not well. Paul pushes his hand away. Eliot shakes his head sadly. Everyone looks at Paul with pity as he runs out."
paul,Come on.   Come on. He swerves into the middle of the road. There's a blind curve ahead... suddenly an SUV comes out of the corner. A bright white light sweeps through his car.     Paul's momentarily blinded.
the screen flashes to white.,Paul opens his eyes. The ROAD'S EMPTY. No sign of any traffic. He's confused. The road was busy a moment ago. Just then flashing red and orange lights illuminate the car. Paul looks in his rear-view mirror.
car,Paul looks through the front windshield.     Nothing.   He frowns. Where did the ambulance go?
up ahead,We see the Funeral Home.   Bone white in the moonlight. The cemetery next to it.
paul,Anna! Just then he glimpses SOMETHING MOVE among the trees. Runs over. Nothing. The cemetery is empty. The trees appear to SHIMMER for a moment. Paul shivers. Pulls his jacket around him. He doesn't notice the candles on Anna's grave behind him suddenly BLOW OUT.
anna,  What was that? Anna responds as if it was nothing strange.  ANNA It's only the scissors... We see the growing anxiety in Paul's eyes.    Anna's just interested in his lips.  PAUL Scissors?   What scissors?  ANNA Scissors. For your clothes.    Eliot just put them on the table. Paul pulls back.   Terrified.  ANNA You're safe now. We're finally together. A strong bright light sweeps across Paul's face. Like the headlights of the car on the blind curve earlier.  FADE TO SEARING WHITENESS. Paul blinks as he gradually gets used to the harsh light. Slowly the room comes into focus...
