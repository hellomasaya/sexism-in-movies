bob anders,"Carnival's bigger today. MARK LIJEK, 29, a consular officer, joins Anders at the window."
ann swift,There are hundreds of people out
bob anders,Are these supposed to be bulletproof?
mark lijek,"Well, they've never been tested."
al golacinski,Marines to Number One -- FALL
bob anders, Can we get some fucking police please?
al golacinski,Don't shoot. You don't want to be the sonofabitch who started a war -
protestors,"La ilaha ilallah -- A WOMAN IN A CHADOR uses her own radio. Some of them ring around the building, holding hands and chanting. Some carry AUTOMATIC WEAPONS openly."
j stafford,-- We're not going out in this --
al golacinski,I'm going outside.
gallegos,Why?
al golacinski,"To reason with them. Marines open the Chancery door, with a look --"
kupke,Just everything. Don't sort it --
ann swift," -- NONE, there are no police --"
cora lijek,"-- Second floor -- anyone who can hear this -- we need help -- As we MOVE DOWN the line of desks, J STAFFORD is also on a radio repeating the same in FARSI -- Others PACK things.  26 INT. THE HALLWAY - INTO THE VAULT - MORNING 26  MARINES and STAFFERS -- including TOM AHERN -- RUN down the hall, pushing a cart of items to secure. They reach the security locker -- code the door -- and enter the locker, heading to the INCINERATOR to begin destroying classified material --  27 EXT. CHANCERY - MORNING 27  Golacinski HELD UP TO THE DOOR -- GUN TO HIS HEAD. He starts to panic.  "
al golacinski,Let me in! Jesus Christ! Open the fucking door! The Marines OPEN THE CHANCERY DOOR -- PROTESTERS POUR IN.

CONSULATE ROOF - MORNING 28  Protestors RUNNING on the roof of the consulate building. Several stop to try and RIP off a vent cover using CLUBS and PIPES.  29 EXT. EMBASSY GROUNDS - MORNING 29  THOUSANDS are now on the grounds of the embassy and they continue to swarm through the gates. The student with the SUPER 8 continues to film it all. Also filming, a NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER with a 16 mm camera. Smoking cannisters of TEAR GAS, people hurling them. A protestor lights a paper on fire to ward off the sting of the gas --  30 INT. CHANCERY OFFICE - MORNING 30  STAFFERS using pieces of machines to destroy other machines -- any embassy equipment that might function -- Then... screams. The lights have gone out. The power has been cut.  31 IN THE VAULT - MORNING 31 AHERN destroys the cryptography keys -- box-sized hard drives -- while BILL DAUGHERTY, 33, tosses stacks of papers into an electrical furnace.  "
bill daugherty,"Well, Tom. You wanted to see the world... The furnace makes a LOUD CHUNK and stops. They both hold their looks for a beat."
bill daugherty,Are you kidding me?
ahern,Get the shredder.
ann swift,"No... Hal -- yes -- INSIDE the building, IN --"
mark lijek,Nobody is coming. We need to go.
bob anders,Iranians first.  Go! Now!

saunders,Six got out!
vance,I was told five.
bates,Apparently it's six now.
vance,What happened?
pender,Not clear. We know they escaped the embassy.
vance,Where are they?
saunders,The Canadian Ambassador's house.
bates,Are we attempting rescue?
brice,Hold for the Secretary --
vance,Is White House joining?
jordan,"We wish it was the fucking Den of Espionage. C.I. had three people there, didn't see a revolution coming? I'd call that something other than intelligence --"

jordan butler," They're sticking to it. No I'll call him back. release till we expel the shah. Jordan sinks into his chair, putting his feet up on the desk. JON TITTERTON, 30s, an aide to Jordan --"
titterton,Put him on a plane. Fuck him.
jordan,He's half dead and he's in chemo.
butler,We took him in. He's ours now.
titterton,So we'll take in any prick as long as he's got cancer?
jordan,"No. Just the pricks on our side. So all our other pricks on their prick thrones know, when they get run out on a rail, they won't be getting their spleens out by a camel vet in the Sinai."
titterton,The six with the Canadians. Now Jordan is looking at a monitor showing footage of a BLINDFOLDED HOSTAGE in front of the Embassy. AL GOLACINSKI being prodded and led down the front stairs of the embassy.
jordan,We've got 60 in the embassy with guns to their heads right now --
titterton,The eyes of the world are on the embassy. That makes them safer than the six on the street.
analyst, Bani-Sadr's saying it'll be over in 24 hours.
jordan,Leave the six where they are. I'll go brief the president.
mendez,Compromised?
mendez,White House?
mendez,Who else knows?
mendez,Jesus Christ.
mendez,Who's handling? They walk through a door and out of the Pit.
mendez,They don't do exfils.
mendez,Then why's he want me?
engell,"Okay. This is Bob Pender from State O.S. He's been talking to Morgan at ExtAff. GENCO, a State Department Assistant, removes a drape from the photographs of SIX FACES, State Department I.D. photos. Pender indicates the first two photos -- and during this, we may flash to scenes of the Houseguests in the Canadian ambassador's residence --"
pender,"Mark and Cora Lijek, 29 and 25. He's a consular officer and she's an assistant. Newlyweds. They just got there a couple of months ago. No language skills or in- country knowledge.  J Stafford. Late twenties. He's smart and a climber. Speaks Farsi. Arranged the hire of his wife Kathy --"
bates,Understaffed so the faculty wives were the typing pool. That gs without comment in this room of men.
pender," Bob Anders. Senior consular officer, oldest of the group. Most likely to be group leader. So."
bates,We wait till the weather clears up then we deliver six bikes and provide maps to the Turkish border.
pender,We have intelligence they can ride bicycles. Or we're prepared to send in somebody to teach them. The professional spies shifting at the stupidity of it. But nobody speaks up. And then --
mendez,"You can send in training wheels and wait at the border with Gatorade. Attention turns to Mendez. O'Donnell shifts. Engell, not happy."
mendez,It's 300 miles to the Turkish crossings. They'd need a support crew behind them with a tire pump.
engell pender," Who is -- We've only been asked to sharpshoot this, State's handling the op."
bates engell,We're exploring that They wouldn't clear airport option. control. Komiteh own the place.

bates malinov,-- visas for American 74. journalists.
malinov,And the Revolutionary Guards keep them on 74 leashes.
mendez,"They get caught with journalist creds, you've got Peter Jennings with a noose around his neck in an hour. PAUL LAMONT, late 20s, a Master's from the Woodrow Wilson School before he joined CIA --"
lamont,"World Noose Tonight. Pender looks at Bates, who is trying to impress his boss."
bates,North American accents give us limited options. So we get the Canadians to issue them passports...
genco,English teachers from the international school. Tested model. It's worked before.
mendez,"The school was shut eight months ago. Bates, meanwhile, removing a binder from his accordion folder: in the binder, a photograph of an emaciated kid in Namibia."
bates,"So do-gooders. They're six Canadians who've been over there inspecting crops. Making sure the kids get enough to eat. Get them creds for an AG NGO -- But he's already lost Mendez, who is going through a newspaper on the table."

pender rossi,I'm sure there's skinny A logo with... seeds. kids... Seeds of Hope'... Mendez holds a page from the newspaper up to Pender.
mendez,"What do you see in the picture, sir? A beat. Pender dsn't like this, but he'll play."
pender,Tehran.
mendez,What's on the ground?
pender,Snow.
mendez,So what crops are the do-gooders inspecting under Frosty? Pender shifts.
mendez,"Exfils are like abortions. You don't wanna need one, but when you do, you don't do it yourself. The meeting is breaking up. Pender, followed by Bates, leaves the room. Engell, who has just been made to look bad and inherited a problem, stops by Tony."
engell,Get one.
night,"At dinner around a dining room table: the SIX HOUSEGUESTS; KEN TAYLOR, 40s, Canadian ambassador. He ds much to support the myth that Canadians are always in a good mood. Next to him is PAT TAYLOR, Filipino, 40s. We're joining various conversations, including one with LEE SCHATZ, 29, an American agricultural attache, the sixth escapee we heard about."
taylor,-- Martin was the worst one. Martin the Maximo King --

kathy stafford, You okay?
cora lijek,"-- if your family's hungry, you don't want to hear about international law --"
mark lijek,Same thing. The sound of a fork on a glass. Ken Taylor is standing up.
taylor,I read today that Tehran was voted the second most desirable city in the world to live in. Everywhere else tied for first.
lee schatz, Our hosts. Mr. Ambassador...
taylor,You should get into the crawl space.
j stafford, Kathy dsn't want to go down again.

chambers,If he could act he wouldn't be playing the Minotaur. He smiles and waves at the Minotaur and begins to work on his prosthetic with a brush and solvent.
chambers,"Hey, Tony."
marmor,They would pose as teachers from the international school.
pender,We went through all that -- it's boarded up -- O'Donnell looking at the clock.
marmor,Suppose the airport guards don't know that --
pender,Suppose. Suppose Heckle and Jeckle go over and save them -- The door swings open.
mendez,Hi. Sorry. Hi.
mendez,They're a Canadian film crew on a location scout for a science fiction movie -- A shift in the room.
mendez,"Star Wars, Star Trek. They need an exotic place to shoot. We put it out -- the Canadian producers put it out -- that they're looking at Turkey, Egypt, whatever. Then we go to the consulate and say we wanna look at Iran. I fly in there and we fly out together as a film crew. Done."
mendez,This is more plausible than foreigners who want to go to school in Iran --
engell,So you're going to wake up tomorrow in the movie business? We have credentials for --
mendez,I've got a contact in L.A.
pender,"(after a beat, to"
night,Lee Schatz and Bob Anders play poker in a room decorated with Persian carpets and mosaics. The gunfire audible here too. Staring at their cards.
lee schatz,50 caliber?
night,"Pat Taylor helps THE SAME WOMAN we just saw, SAHAR, 20s, clear the table. She is their housekeeper."
sahar,"Your friends from Canada, ma'am. All this time. They never go out. A significant moment of eye contact. Then Sahar gs back to clearing the table."
j stafford,You've washed them three times. He puts his arm on her shoulder. She keeps scrubbing.
pat taylor,Sahar knows.
mendez,What are you shooting?
chambers,A monster movie.
mendez,Any good?
chambers,The target audience will hate it.
mendez,Who's the target audience?
chambers,People with eyes. Talk to me.
mendez,It's an exfil.
chambers,From where?
mendez,Worst place you can think of.
chambers,Universal City.
chambers,How you getting in the embassy?
mendez,Six got away. They're hiding in the city. I'm going over to get them.
chambers,What am I making?
mendez,I need you to help me make a fake movie.
chambers,You've come to the right place.
mendez,I need to set up a production company and build a cover around making a movie.
chambers,That we're not going to make.
mendez,No.
chambers,You want to go around Hollywood acting like you're an important person in the movie business.
mendez,That's right.
chambers,But you don't want to actually do anything.
mendez,No.
chambers,You'll fit right in.
chambers,This one's got an M.A. in English. She should be your screenwriter. Sometimes they go on scouts cause they want the free meals.  This guy's the director.
mendez,Can you teach a guy how to be a director in a day?
chambers,"You can teach a rhesus monkey to be a director in a day. Look, if you're gonna do it, you've got to do it. The Khomaniacs are fruit loops, but they have cousins selling eight tracks and prayer rugs on La Brea. You can't build cover stories around a movie that dsn't exist. You need a script. You need a producer."
mendez,I'm the producer.
chambers,"No, you're not. Associate' at best. If it's a twenty-million dollar Star Wars rip-off, you need somebody who's a somebody to put his name on it. Here we see some AUTOGRAPHED 70s CELEBRITY 8X10s hanging on the wall. The waiter brings a bill."
chambers,Somebody respectable. With credits. Who we can trust with classified information. Who'll produce a fake movie. For free.
chambers,"Mazel tov, Lester."
siegel,"Aaah, I'd rather stay home and count the wrinkles on my dog's balls. These fuckin' things are like getting measured for your coffin. He don't look so good. Let's give him an honorary award.'"
siegel,"Six people in the middle of a city of, what, four million -- ON TV, a wild-eyed woman in the crowd  makes an ax- falling gesture with her arm repeatedly."
siegel,-- who chant Death to America' all the livelong day. You wanna set up a picture in a week. Lie to a whole town of people who lie for a living. Have Double-O-Seven here sneak into a country that wants CIA blood with their breakfast cereal. Duck Iranian intelligence. Then walk the Brady Bunch out of the most watched city in the world...
mendez,... and past a hundred Komiteh at the airport.
siegel,"Look, I wanna help you but... In the Army, we did suicide missions that had better odds. So lemme hit it again for the cheap seats:"
chambers,"(to Lester, as he"
chambers,"You ever think, Lester, how it's all for the cameras?"
siegel,"They're getting the ratings, I'll give em that -- Siegel looks at the TV: at that moment, a HOSTAGE TAKER holding up photos of hostages for CAMERAS in front of him. He takes a beat."
siegel,We're gonna need a script. A beat of silence. A LOOK from Siegel to Chambers.
siegel,Nobody makes Westerns anymore.
chambers, It's ancient Troy.
siegel,"If it's got horses in the title, it's a Western."
chambers," Yeah, Kenny, please. It's John Chambers, about the office space."
siegel,"If I'm doing a fake movie, it's gonna be a fake hit."
mendez,That's too soon.
mendez," Fade in on starship landing. An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe. Women gather, offering ecstatic libations to the sky gods.'"
siegel,It's in turnaround. It's dog shit.
mendez,It's a space movie in the Middle East. Ds it matter? Chambers looks at the BULLSEYE logo on the cover page. Reacts.
mendez,Why do we need the option?
siegel,You're worried about the Ayatollah? Try the WGA.
siegel,He's only a prick if you catch him on the wrong day.
mendez,Is it the wrong day?
siegel,It's always the wrong day. They've arrived at a door with a sign: MAX KLEIN
klein,You're gonna get this into production in one month?
klein,Who are you again?
mendez,Kevin Harkins. Studio Six Films.
siegel,He's the money.
klein,"I thought you were retired, Lester."
siegel,"-- Till I read the Argo. Look, how bout we say fifteen thou and close on this?"
klein,"You want me to be honest with you, Les?"
siegel,"Naah, bullshit me, Max."
klein,"Okay. Because I enjoyed your films, the early ones. I took this meeting out of respect because I wanted to tell you no' to your face."
siegel,Thank you. Very respectful.
klein,"You're done, Lester. You've gotta get your cataracts fixed and read the trades. MGM just capitalized for six new films and they're desperate for Sci-Fi. They've already offered me four times what you are."
siegel,"But see -- it worries me, what you said, and I'll tell you why. A couple weeks back I was sitting in Trader Vic's enjoying a Mai Tai when my pal Warren Beatty came to wish me well and we had a little chat. Seems he was attached to star in Zulu Empire -- which was gonna anchor that MGM slate -- but Warren confided in me that the picture's gone over-budget cause the Zulu extras wanna unionize."
siegel,"The way this looks to me -- through the cataracts, I grant you -- is that you can either sign here and take ten thousand for your toilet-paper script -- or you can go fuck yourself. Siegel smiles kindly and holds a pen and the contracts out to Klein. Klein takes them."
mendez,You know Warren Beatty?
siegel,I took a leak next to him at the Golden Globes.
mendez,"You got kids, Lester?"
siegel,Two daughters.
mendez,You see them much?
siegel,"I talk to them once a year, maybe."
mendez,Why's that?
siegel,I was a terrible father.
mendez,A son. Lives with his mother in Virginia.
siegel,You're divorced?
mendez,Taking time off.  He's gotta... stay where he is.
mendez, War' sounds like Star Wars. Let's use a different word. Mendez closes the door to his private office.
mendez,I need another week.
mendez,We've got a script. We've got business cards.We've got a poster. If I'm them? It's nothing we couldn't make at home.
chambers,I did a movie with Rock Hudson once.
siegel," -- press event and reading... No, I promised Variety exclusive on that one... Mendez is making a list with a PUBLICIST."
mendez,Biggest Canadian production in history.' Canadian Gone With The
siegel," I gotta get back to you, Phil. I can't get my own mother a ticket. I had to tell her it was cancelled."
mendez,Are you turning people away?
siegel," Philip? You there? Chambers leads us into the main room, leading Tony to a table where JACK KIRBY, 62, comics artist, fusses with large COMIC PANELS of ARGO CONCEPT DRAWINGS spread over a table. Kirby starts to distribute storyboards. Some hold on to them and an ASSISTANT begins putting them up on the board. Mendez looks at them. Impressed. He picks up a drawing of some futuristic-looking vehicles."
kirby,Mesopotamia... Egypt...
mendez,Iran. Kirby takes out a marker and starts to sketch a futuristic-looking desert glider.
publicist,Janet from the Times -- You know Johnny Chambers and Lester Siegel. This is Kevin Harkins. He'll tell you a bit about the film -- We leave Mendez with the L.A. Times -- FOLLOWING Siegel -- Jack Kirby's storyboard drawings throughout the room. Four or five ACTORS IN SCI-FI COSTUMES.
siegel,You're gorgeous. You're in the reading?
nina,"I'm playing Serksi, the Galactic Witch. BACK TO: Mendez. A Publicist is guiding Mendez toward an anemic-looking man --"
publicist,"(to Mendez,"
siegel,Keep that fucking space witch away from me.
chambers,You know her?
siegel,"I was married to her. Mendez, now talking to RODD, from VARIETY."
mendez,Tehran.
rodd,"You ever watch the news? Publicist hands Mendez a LASER GUN and a photographer snaps his picture. Siegel walks by, downing one from the bar."
reporter,So the title refers to...
siegel,"The Argo, it's the, y'know, the"
reporter,"... Jason and the Golden Fleece, or...?"
reporter,Is it the Argonaut? Siegel dsn't know what he's talking about.
siegel,No.
reporter,Then what ds Argo' mean? And finally Lester's had it -- with his mouth full --
siegel,It means Argo fuck yourself.
publicist,"Let's all take our places for the reading. And we SETTLE ON MENDEZ. He takes a glass of wine from a passing waiter's tray, downs it, and puts it on another WAITER'S tray. We FOLLOW that waiter THROUGH a swinging door, INTO the kitchen and prep area, where a small black and white TV plays..."

mark lijek,A hundred and twelve --
mark lijek,"And we have a new champion. Bob Anders looks up from Khomeini, who keeps talking in the b.g., and applauds."
mendez,Why'd he do it?
mendez,"It's a death sentence, Jack."
siegel,"I made thirty pictures. Half of them the pricks upstairs tried to shut me down. Mendez finishes packing, zips up the bag."
siegel,My ass is staying right here and running a movie company. Mendez stops zipping as Siegel takes a bottle of Jack and three shot glasses from a drawer.
chambers,Argo fuck yourself. They raise to that.
mendez,How'd you always get around the pricks upstairs?
siegel,There's always another prick one floor higher up.
mendez,"You can forget about that time- share in Ocean City, Jack."
day,"Tony and O'Donnell sit in the waiting area, across from a SECRETARY. They look down the hall to see: CIA DIRECTOR ADMIRAL STANSFIELD TURNER, 50s, and SECRETARY OF STATE CYRUS VANCE walk down the hall together, discussing something in hushed tones.  O'DONNELL  Brace yourself. It's like talking to those two old fucks on The Muppets.' Vance and Turner enter the room without recognizing them. Mendez and O'Donnell stand up.  145 INT.

bob anders,-- it was thirty seconds for Christ's sake. To get some air in the yard. I couldn't breathe --
bob anders,Who saw me go out?
bob anders, Miss Hall Monitor. Creeping around with her notebook --
lee schatz,"Dad's home. Ken carrying his briefcase, cheerfully oblivious to what he's walked into."
taylor,You're getting a visitor.
jordan,A man in Scranton's putting a flag on his lawn for every day of captivity.
jordan, Who signed off on this?
consul official,What will be the purpose of your visit to Iran?
mendez,Business. Film production. The Consul Official looks at his Canadian passport.
consul official,Why didn't you get your visa in Canada?
mendez,My boss waited until I was here to send the telex.
mendez,Can't be right all the time.
nicholls,Mr. Harkins.
mendez,When'd you get back?
mendez,Were you metal detecting?
nicholls,None left to find. Shah escaped with a 747 so laden with gold bars it nearly didn't make it off the runway.
mendez,But you kept busy.
nicholls,"Ferrying out the torture apparatus of our friend's fallen dictatorship. Both these men do this work and share an unspoken understanding. They stop and look up at a MOSAIC on the wall. An ancient rendition of Christ, fashioned before the Muslims took the city and converted this church to a mosque. Nicholls has WHITE AND YELLOW SLIPS OF PAPER with Farsi writing on them in hand. He gives them to Tony."
nicholls,"It's getting worse. Everybody who lands at Mehrabad now fills out one of these.  Passenger keeps Yellow, Airport keeps White."
mendez,"So if they look, they'll know six people didn't come in with me."
nicholls,"If they look. Nicholls and Tony turn away from the mosaic, surreptitious work now done, and meander toward the middle of the great room."
nicholls,"When you land, you should go straight to the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance to kiss the ring. Get on record as having applied for a film permit. If they catch you later, at least they'll be confused while they're torturing you... Your biggest problem may be convincing the six of them to go with you. They're foreign service. They're willful. Nicholls takes a picture."
mendez,How's June?
nicholls,Left.
mendez,I'm sorry.
nicholls,"She picked out a ring and gave me a choice. She's a Chinese national. If I married her, I'd have to resign, so. You and Christine?"
mendez,Good. Yeah.
behrouz,This film crew is just yourself?
mendez,Six more are joining me today. They're coming from Canada.
behrouz,You'd like to film at the bazaar?
mendez,"The bazaar, maybe the palace."
mendez,Mr. Ambassador.
taylor,Ken Taylor. He shakes Tony's hand and they start to walk to Taylor's car.
taylor,I was expecting more of a G-Man look.
mendez,"You're thinking of FBI, sir. They get into the car."
taylor,"These are blank, y'know. The stamps?"
mendez,I'll take care of that.
taylor,How long?
mendez,A day to prep them with their cover stories. Two if they need it.
taylor,And you'll fly out with them? Tony nods. A distant sound of a crowd outside.
taylor,There's something you should know. We think one of our housekeepers figured out who they are. We don't know if we can trust her. Now the noise outside is louder. Taylor turns to the window. Tony joins him.
taylor,"So sooner is better. They stand listening to the demonstration sounds, echoing over the rooftops of the city."
pender, The Times and A.P. found out they're with the Canadians. Somebody in one of the families talked.
pender,I just put Vance on a plane to take the editors to Le Cirque. He thinks he can get them to sit on it. For now.
night,Each Houseguest has a copy of the ARGO script.
bob anders,It's theater of the absurd.
mark lijek,What are the chances?
mendez,The chances are good.
mark lijek,What's the number value of good'? 30 percent chance of success? 80 percent?
cora lijek,We just --
mendez,There are no Canadians in the country for normal reasons.
bob anders,We can't stand up to that. We don't know what the hell movie people do.
mendez,That's why I'm here. I'll be with you. This is what I do.
mendez,This would be a first.
j stafford,... every day they catch another friend of the shah at the airport. Kangaroo trials then firing squads. Just for having American names in their phone books. He puts the Iranian newspaper in front of Mendez.
j stafford,"You've been here an hour and you're asking us to trust you with our lives, Mr. --"
mendez,Harkins.
j stafford,Is that your real name? A beat.
mendez,No.
taylor,We've got orders to close the embassy and go back. There's nowhere for them to stay.
j stafford,"I'm serious, too. This is what?"
bob anders,I saw it in Burma. They get people out. They know how.
j stafford,Snitches in banana republics. They get them over the border after the coup...
mark lijek,His opinion got us out of the embassy in the first place.
mendez,"If we go, you need to leave immediately. There's a"
taylor,"Pat and I discussed it. If they catch you at the airport, they come here and we go on trial for harboring the enemy. It's a risk we took.  Can you pull this off?"
mendez,I don't know.
j stafford,"-- even if they do. They find us here, we're not lying, we're just hiding. We go out there with fake passports, we're spies, period, execution."
cora lijek,So how long do we stay? A month? A year?
j stafford,"That man out there, he's got bad cards, he's gonna lose. If he loses, it's our lives."
kathy stafford, And his life too. Another beat. ANGLES ON the Houseguests.
mendez,"What I need you to do is memorize everything inside. Who you are, what you are, where you've been. Cora Lijek looks at a document from inside her envelope. A union card for the Canadian Writers Guild with her picture on it."
mendez,"When we're done, you'll know these so well that you'll dream as these people. Mendez nods at them, and gs. The Houseguests look at what's inside their envelopes -- all except J Stafford, whose envelope remains sealed."
bellhop,"Sir, a telex arrived for you. The BELLHOP hands Tony a piece of paper. He reads it."
mendez, He will send a representative to meet you and your crew at the Khayyam entrance to the Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 PM.'
mendez,Or maybe they're cooperating.
mendez,"Seven Canadians, Jack."
mendez,They're getting there.
j stafford,"We are a nation of 35 million and... many of these people are looking forward to martyrdom. Kathy Stafford looks into the room. J stops talking, looks up."
j stafford,"She pleaded with me. Mark, looking to J. This is new."
j stafford,"When it started in the streets nine months ago. She begged for us to leave. She packed our bags. I said, A little longer.' And what I was thinking was, This is a good thing for me. Stay. Show Newsom you've got the balls. Grab for the ring.'"
morning,"The Houseguests are gathered in the office. Cora hands the telefax to Bob Anders. J Stafford, looking on."
cora lijek,You said a day to learn your covers then straight to the airport.' You said that.
bob anders,They suspect something?
mendez,"What I know is we need to act like a movie crew. We go to the bazaar today, we fly out tomorrow. Silent assent among the group. Then J Stafford, sitting with his wife, speaks up --"
j stafford,We won't do it.
mark lijek,He told them there were six of us. They're expecting six.
mendez,I'm asking you to trust me.
j stafford,I don't trust you.
bob anders," What's the alternative? This is the ball game, J. What world are you living in?"
j stafford,"The one where they're hanging people from construction cranes, Bob. J takes Kathy's hand and gs, leaving Mendez with the others. After a moment --"
pat taylor,"This one. She gives Bob Anders a Canadian maple leaf lapel pin, which he affixes to his shirt. Cora Lijek paints lighter hair dye onto her hair. The Houseguests are making subtle efforts to disguise themselves."
cora lijek,"(at a mirror, quoting"
mark lijek,Not that picture. You won't want to scare them. A nervous smile. Trying to deal with anxiety. J and Kathy Stafford look to each other. Sitting reading newspapers while the other Houseguests prep for the scout. The PHONE starts ringing.
pat taylor, Hello? A cloud comes over Pat as she listens.
pat taylor,"No, there's no one like that here. She hangs up the phone fast, as if it were hot to the touch."
mendez,"This one, how much? One day, how much?"
mendez,"I promise you that if you will play along today, I will get you out tomorrow."
j stafford,"I wish I could believe you, Mr. Harkins."
mendez,My name is Tony Mendez. Mendez gs back out to the minivan. STAY WITH J and Kathy.
mendez,Tell me who you are. This recalls attention from the windows.
lee schatz,"Mike McEwan, cameraman."
bob anders,"Robert Baker, director."
mark lijek,"Timothy Harris, location manager."
cora lijek,"Mary Ann Boyd, screenwriter."
kathy stafford,"Rachel Dewart, production designer. Kathy looks at her husband."
j stafford,"Sean Bissett, associate producer."
mendez,Let's make a movie.
reza,You are the director?
bob anders,Yes.
bob anders,I'm sorry?
reza,"A film where a foreign bride is brought to Iran, but she dsn't understand the language and customs and there are misunderstandings and laughs."
bob anders,No.
reza," Mmmm. Mendez walking toward the back of the group. Lee, the cameraman, is looking through a viewfinder down the alley of the bazaar."
lee schatz, Yeh.
mendez,"If I said you were looking through the wrong end of that viewfinder, would I be right? Lee turns the viewfinder around and looks through it again."
angle,"Mendez talking to Lee from a distance. A zoom, a closer snapshot of LEE. Then of CORA LIJEK, who walks through the bazaar with an open ARGO SCRIPT in her hand. The Revolutionary Guard photographer is taking pictures of each of the Houseguests, picking their portraits off one by one like a sniper."
sahar,"(Farsi, from behind"
mendez,She's the production designer. Her job is to take photographs. SHOPKEEPER getting more and more heated in Farsi.
reza,He says he did not give you permission to take a photograph of his store. Other BAZAARIS and SHOPPERS are starting to gather. Kathy holds out the Polaroid toward the Shopkeeper.
kathy stafford,He can have the photograph. Tell
lee schatz, He's saying the Shah killed his son with an American gun. Cauldron heating up and --
day,ON Sahar -- her face impassive -- and then --
day,A CROWD starts to gather around the group.
on kathy,Her claustrophobia as the crowd closes in -- an ANGRY BAZAARI WOMAN sticks her finger in Kathy's face --
cora lijek, Canada... Ca-na-da...
lee schatz, He says we're the CIA taking photographs to plan the bombing of the city.
day,"Khalkali eyes Sahar, gauging her. She hides her fear well."
sahar,As god wills it.
day,"-- and Sahar, so dignified and stony she is almost shaming these men --"
sahar,Everyone in this house is a friend of Iran. Khalkali makes his decision. He wordlessly turns to go.
taylor,They drew you out there to take your picture.
mendez,"Nobody broke. At the door to the residence, Tony can see Pat Taylor, holding Sahar's hand, both looking spooked as the Houseguests come inside."
mendez,Where was your passport issued? Bob Anders dsn't know. ANGLES ON the Houseguests.
anders,Vancouver.
mendez,Where were you born?
bob anders,Toronto.
mendez,Toronno like piranha. Canadians don't pronounce the T.
lee schatz,Some border guard's gonna know that?
mendez,"If you're held for questioning, they'll bring in somebody who knows that."
mendez, Last three Canadian prime minsters.
cora lijek," Trudeau, Pearson, Diefenbaker."
mendez,Good.  Your job on the film.
j stafford,Producer.
mendez,Associate Producer. What's the name of the last film you worked on?
j stafford,Uh... High and Dry.
mendez,Who paid for the movie?
mendez,"What's your middle name? J Stafford is silent. He looks down to consult the paper in front of him, but before he can, Mendez pulls the paper."
mendez,"He's an American spy. Shoot him. A beat on Stafford, frustrated --"
mendez,They'll try to break you by getting you agitated. You need to know your rsum so well that you don't flinch.
j stafford,"(nearly defeated,"
mendez,My story's the only thing between you and the gun to your head. A beat. Mendez puts the rsum back in front of Stafford. Kathy looks at her husband: he just isn't good at this.
mendez,Let's go again.
taylor,Kevin.
mendez,What is it?
mendez,I never would have exposed them if I wasn't authorized to take them out.
mendez,They will be taken. Probably not
mendez,We're responsible for those people.
cora lijek,We're ready to try again.
mendez, I think the most important thing you can do to be ready for tomorrow is rest.
night,"Now the mood among the Houseguests is lighter. Bob Anders, a handful of liquor bottles in his arms, puts them down on a table. Music plays on a record player."
bob anders,"Scorched earth policy tonight. Nothing gets left. Taylor comes in, drink in hand, thoughts heavy, looks at Tony."
mendez,So you know.
taylor,"If we tell them, they'll panic. It's better if you just don't show."
chambers,It's off. They want us to pack up the office. A beat on Lester. He's devastated but he's not showing it.
kathy stafford, He's late.
mendez,"Somebody is responsible for things when things happen, Jack. I am responsible."
sosa,N.E. shut that down.
sosa,I can't do it. It's backstopped pending Executive Branch GO.
sosa,Carter's got to say yes for us to get the tickets.
secretary,He's in a meeting.
pat taylor,Sahar's on a bus.
mendez,Good. And you two leave right now. Ken Taylor nods. Mendez shakes his hand.
taylor,"(to Gauthier, as he"
engell,"N.E. said NO, this is not a long- leasher..."
engell,You're goddamn close...
engell,You're goddamn close to the line with me.
mendez,"Your passports came straight from the Canadians, so you're gonna be fine."
malinov,He's on the plane.
malinov,How would I find him?
mendez,The second checkpoint --  249 INT. CIA - THE PIT - NIGHT  249
malinov,Jordan's in the West Wing. He's not taking calls. A beat on O'Donnell.
mendez,The second is immigration. You'll hand them these. They say you landed two days ago.
malinov,"Pace Academy in Buckhead, Georgia! O'Donnell dials a number."
mendez,It's manned by Revolutionaries. Most of them were educated in the U.S. or Europe.
bob anders,Or Canada?
mendez,They know how many T's are in Toronto.
jordan,Hello?
jordan,Wait -- WHO -- ?
jordan,(yelling out his
lamont,"Telex on Flash. The telex begins to print, line by line..."
swissair rep,"I'm sorry, sir. I don't have those reservations... SWISSAIR REP looks at some green text on her screen, hits another button."
swissair rep,My apologies. They just came through. She hits another button and tickets start to print.
malinov,We told them to shut that down! He RUNS toward a phone --
immigration officer, When did you say you arrived in Iran?
bob anders,Two days ago.
immigration officer,What was the purpose of your visit?
bob anders,We were looking at locations to make a film. I'm the director. Immigration Officer pauses and looks up. Looks at the six other faces. He looks every bit as confrontational as Tony acted in rehearsal.
immigration officer,Okay -- Yes -- Okay -- He waves them through. Second checkpoint done.
malinov,C'mon c'mon c'mon --
lamont, Purser's telling Swissair they're not on the plane.
malinov, Still no answer in L.A.
mark lijek,A film. Mark mimes turning the rotor of a movie camera. Komiteh #1 dsn't understand.  AZIZI 
azizi,"(harsh, icy; in"
azizi,(to J Stafford; in
mendez,You can call our office. Mendez hands Azizi his card. STUDIO SIX FILMS. Kevin Harkins. A 213  phone number.
siegel,"I'm sorry, pally. We're just gonna be in the movie. Call my agent.  P.A. Sir. SIR! Siegel and Chambers walk through the shot toward the Argo office.  279 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - KOMITEH STATION - MORNING 279  Azizi dials the long international number. And it is a DIAL, so this takes a long time.  280 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - THIRD CHECKPOINT - MORNING 280  One of the young Komiteh is loudly debating with another Komiteh the air-worthiness of a futuristic desert glider in the storyboards. He's miming the thing crashing. J Stafford and the Houseguests are silent. Mendez can see the line of passengers on their Swissair flight dwindling.  281 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - KOMITEH STATION - MORNING 281  Azizi rings the phone three times -- four times -- he's going to hang up --  CHAMBERS  Studio Six Films.  282 INT. ARGO PRODUCTION OFFICE - NIGHT 282  A beat of silence. Chambers catching his breath, listening. The door to the office wide open.  283 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - KOMITEH STATION - MORNING 283"
azizi,May I speak to Mr. Kevin Harkins --  
azizi,No message.  286 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - MORNING 286
morning,"The Komiteh search the house. Khalkali gets on the phone.  292 OMITTED 292  293 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - FLIGHT GATE - MORNING 293  Kathy Stafford's ticket is taken and she walks through the door. Hurries toward the transport bus. The other five Houseguests and Mendez behind her and --  294 INT. MEHRABAD AIRPORT - KOMITEH STATION - MORNING 294  A phone rings and a Young Komiteh picks up the call. He listens for a moment. Then he drops the phone and RUNS into the airport terminal and --  295 INT. RUNWAY TRANSPORT BUS - MORNING 295  The Houseguests sit aboard the bus, headed to a waiting  DC-10. The DRIVER puts the bus into gear. It dsn't go. He shakes his head. This goddamn thing. Shifts gears again. Now it gs."
malinov,They're CLEAR! Cheers in the Pit. O'Donnell embraces Malinov.
flight attendant,Sir? J gs back to his seat. HOLD ON Tony Mendez.
siegel,"It's history, is what it is. History plays out first as farce, then as tragedy.'"
chambers,The quote's the other way around.
siegel,Who said it?
chambers,Marx.
siegel,Groucho?
chambers,Karl.
lamont,(a couple of beers
rossi lamont,"Six down, fifty to go. Call the Times, nail it to the fucking door. The CIA are the good guys."
malinov,The Canadians are the good guys.
lamont,-- we're not greedy -- them too --
malinov,"Only. Canada takes the credit, or they'll retaliate against the hostages. Great Satan wasn't involved. No CIA."
lamont,"Is that right, Jack?"
siegel,"She said, Why couldn't we pull off something like that?' You know what I said to her?"
mendez,Wha'd you say to her?
siegel,"I said, Argo fuck yourself.'  333 INT. CIA ARCHIVES - DAY 333  And suddenly it's dead-quiet. We're in a vault inside a vault in the basement of the main building. Mendez's suitcase is laying on a low counter, an ARCHIVES OFFICER t-tagging and cataloging various items. Separating Mendez's personal things from material related to the operation. Mendez empties his briefcase and the officer puts a sticker on the VARIETY featuring the ARGO ad. Another on the ARGO script. He's putting things into a box that reads: USCIA CLASSIFIED MATERIAL. Mendez opens his accordion folder -- flips through it -- it's empty -- no. There's something inside. In one of the compartments is a STORYBOARD FROM ARGO. One that the Komiteh missed. While the Archives Officer is turned around, Mendez slips the storyboard back into the accordion folder and puts it back with his personal things."
mendez,He wants to fire me himself.
mendez,"If they push it a week, I can bring Ian. That's his winter break."
mendez,"They're gonna hand me an award, then they're gonna take it back?"
mendez,I thought we did. O'Donnell claps Tony on the shoulder. Tony walks towards the entrance and Jack heads to his car.
another angle,"Chambers is disassembling the office. Boxes packed. Everything now off the walls. A PRODUCER walks by, sees Chambers in the door."
producer,What happened to your picture?
chambers,It's in turnaround. He turns out the lights.
mendez,Hi.
christine,"Hi. They look at each other. Before she can speak, he's embraced her. Holds tight. It's something in between romantic and fraternal. Not reconciliation, necessarily, but warmth. She reciprocates. It feels right, and good."
night,A scene of the Old West on a television.
another angle,Ian is watching 1973's sci-fi Western Westworld in the bedroom. Ian dsn't have to describe the scene to his father this time. WIDEN to see that his head is on a pillow on Tony's lap.
