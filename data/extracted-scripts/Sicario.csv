Speaker,Dialogue
woman's voice," Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come..."
macy,Give us this day... our daily bread...
swat officer,YOU HIT??
macy,I'm good. I'm good.
swat officer,WHAT THE FUCK??
macy,Can't shake the smell. Just sits in you.
reggie,Yeah... Sorry I wasn't on your six. Got wrapped up in the front room.
macy,I saw.
lance,Loan you SWAT and you hand us three dozen homicides. I oughta fucking pepper spray you.
macy,Couldn't smell any worse.
lance,Ha ha. You're not the one gotta clean this shit up.
macy,"Yeah. Thirty families without a father's real funny, but you keep worrying about what it does to your weekend, Lance."
lance,Listen you fucking   --
reggie,"I didn't hear you, you say something?"
lance,"Clear your people out, it's our crime scene now."
macy,It's your crime scene when I GIVE IT TO YOU!!!
reggie,What are the chances they'll put together a case.
macy,... None.
reggie,Look.
macy,No.
jennings,You okay?
macy,I'm fine.
phil,Looks like Sinaloa...
jennings,Yeah.  How many total?
coroner,"Between here and the hall we have thirty, but there's more in the back bedroom and we haven't looked in the attic or under the crawl space."
jennings," Call DOJ in Washington, let em know what we have."
macy,"No way to connect him, but he owns it."
officer,I NEED BOLT CUTTERS.
jennings,PD found something.
macy,OW.
macy,Me too. You get my card?
macy,"Mom, I just got --"
macy,I'm signing on.
mom,Can you see me?
macy,"Stay in one place, Mom. Happy birthday. Sorry I didn't call-"
mom,Can you see me? I don't see you. Lean forward -- there you are... What happened to your face?
macy,Nothing. It's something on your lens.
mom,Kate. I can see it.
macy,"Like I said, rough day."
mom,"What a waste of a law degree, Kate."
macy,Who came to the party?
mom,Evan sent me a card. I thought that was very sweet. Have you two spoken?
macy,No.
mom,Well... I hope you two will become friends.
macy,"I'm sure we'll be great friends, Mother. Nothing like a divorce to bring people closer."
mom,You look tired.
macy,I am...  Happy birthday. How does it feel to be 60?
mom,"It would feel a lot better with a grandchild, and I don't think it's UNREAS--"
macy,"I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT GRANDCHILDREN.  Yeah, umm... I can, I can be there in, say thirty minutes? Yes sir."
reggie,Know what's going on?
macy,No idea.
reggie,"We did this by the book, right?"
macy,Come on ... Of course.
reggie,What? Oh shit.
phil,"Would you step in here, Kate?"
burnett,Quite a find today ... The loss of two officers not withstanding.
macy,"His company, Sun Valley, owns eighty or so foreclosure properties, another --"
matt,What do you know about his brother?
macy,Um ... Wasn't aware he had one.
matt,Guillermo... Mexican police are holding him in Juarez. What do you know about his cousin?
macy,Didn't know he had one of those either.
burnett,His cousin is Fausto Alarcon.
macy,I don't know who that is.
matt,Number three in the Sinaloa Cartel.
burnett,Manuel Diaz is likely their most senior member in the United States.
macy,None of this is in his file.
burnett,With good reason.
matt,"Loose lips sink ships, Kate."
macy,I'm not --
jennings,"Agent Macy doesn't work narcotics, she runs a kidnapping response team."
matt,You married?
macy,I'm sorry?
matt,Husband?
macy,Divorced.
matt,Kids?
macy,"No. He works for Border Patrol and got to keep the condo and my Bronco, anything else?"
phil,"Thank you Kate, if you could wait outside, please."
reggie,... Well?
macy,I have no clue.
phil,"Will you come in, Kate?"
jennings,DOJ wants advisors that focus on cartels involved in pursuing Mr. Diaz. This is Matt Graves. He'll be LEADING --
macy,He'll be leading who? This is Phoenix Homicide now.
matt,We're expanding the scope of the investigation.
phil,You'll act as a liaison.
macy,What does that mean?
phil,"State Department is pulling an agent from the field that specializes in responding to escalated cartel activity. You'll meet up with them... at Luke, Tomorrow?"
matt,Day after. Early.
macy,Luke ... Air Force base?
matt,Gonna go see Guillermo.
macy,His brother.
matt,That's the one.
macy,"Okay... If I, umm... What's our objective?"
matt,Our objective is to dramatically overreact.
macy,Why isn't Reggie in here?
matt,He's a little green. You've been kicking doors longer.
jennings,Kate. You must volunteer for an interagency task force... Think very hard before you respond ... You want to be a part of this?
macy,We get an opportunity at the men responsible for today?
matt,The men who are REALLY responsible.
macy,"Then yeah, sure. I'll volunteer."
boy's voice,Papa?
silvio,No.
boy's voice,Si.
silvio,No.
eliseo,Si Papa! Tenemos que ir!
man,Colonel Guteman. Yes...
alejandro,And you too...
man,"Of course me too! If the Americans would leave, you would see... no one is pure."
alejandro,Sit down.
man,Why?
alejandro,Can't walk back like this. We need to dry.
man,What will you do with me?
alejandro,Nothing.
man,Will I be arrested?
alejandro,No.
man,What will you do with the Colonel?
alejandro,Nothing.  I just wanted to know.
man,If you tell. They will kill me... my family.
alejandro,Don't give me a reason.
man,How do I avoid that?
alejandro,By telling me the truth without having to drown you.
man,So... that's it then?
alejandro,If you are very lucky you never will.
matt,We'll get to that...
alejandro,Why so many?
matt,Don't want anything to happen to you on the way to the airport.
alejandro,Where are we going?
matt,To keep my promise.
alejandro,What did they do?
matt,Doesn't matter. It leads to Fausto. And I'm going to turn you loose.
alejandro,Thank you.
reggie,You're back tonight?
macy,"Yeah. I'll call you, let you know what time."
reggie,I don't understand why they don't want me there...
macy,It's El Paso... Don't think you're missing much.
reggie,Well... you keep your eye on that doughy prick in the golf shirt...
macy,I'm supposed to worry about you.
reggie,"This isn't what we do, Kate."
macy,We do what we need to do.
airport mp, You're not on here.
reggie,I know. What's she supposed to do?
airport mp,Walk.
macy,I'll call you when we're heading back.
macy,Am I late?
matt,No. We just landed.
alejandro,Hello.
macy,Kate Macy.
alejandro,Have you been to Juarez before?
macy,"No... Wait, we're going to El Paso, right?"
matt,"Yeah, we'll talk about it on the plane."
macy,We're taking this?
matt,Yeah.
macy,Really... Okay...
alejandro,What is your experience with operations like these?
macy,None... What IS the operation?
alejandro,Sleep if you can. Juarez will demand all of your focus.
macy,Are we going into Juarez?
matt,You guys don't have one?
macy,Right... Food on this flight?
matt,They got some bitchin peanuts in the back. Kind of a self-serve deal though.
macy,JESUS!!
alejandro,Yes.
macy,So... This is your specialty.
alejandro,Hmm?
macy,He said the cartels in Mexico are your specialty.
alejandro,Yes.
macy,Anything I should know?
alejandro,"You are asking how a watch works. For now, only focus on knowing the time."
macy,Okay... Yoda.
steve,How you been?
matt,Good. Trying to get DOD to let me look into this conspiracy to sink Figi.
steve,It's the damn terrorists. They're sinking all the tropical islands.
matt,"I figure a month or two there, I could get it worked out."
steve,Hear there's a real drug problem at the Four Seasons there. You need any help looking into it...
matt,"Yeah, I'll keep you posted... who's going over today?"
steve,"Marshals, DEA. Pulled a team for you."
matt,I get all warm and fuzzy when you say `team'.
steve,It's a crack bunch too. Just rotated back from Afghanistan.
matt,Where's everybody linking up?
steve,Army Intelligence Center.
guard,ID's all around. Hey Steve.
matt,Thought you were in the big time in Phoenix... welcome to Baghdad.
guard,Be safe.
alejandro,Pay attention.
marshal,"Mexican Federal Police will meet you at the border and proceed with you to the courthouse located  here. This is a high level target. The most likely spot for an attempt will be at the exchange and the border. The Marshals will enter -- Kevin, Keith, wanna stand up?"
matt," Man, I love Texans."
alejandro,Memorize the faces of everyone here. Know who is with you.
marshal,"Marshals' response team is in Laredo so, our friends from Delta have volunteered to come along and will escort the Marshals at the exchange."
matt,"Sure, we'll take the tour. Loan me a couple of pop guns?"
marshal,"This is turning into an All-Star affair. Wanna another hand at the exchange, Keith?"
keith, You sober?
matt,I will be by the time we get there.
keith,I got a bottle in the truck in case yer hands git to shakin.
matt,"I miss your hospitality, Keith."
marshal,"Alright. So, and we'll gear you up when we're done, Matt -- you can be the tip of the spear and we don't have to rob a guy from Delta... Be careful on the turn-around -- if a Federale is a shooter it will be on the turn around. Ray, your Team 1 is lead vehicle and we can divide team 2 into the carry car and the trail vehicles, that okay?"
macy,Ever been over there?
alejandro,I worked in Juarez.
macy,For the DEA?
alejandro,No.
macy,For who?
alejandro,Mexico. As a federal prosecutor.
macy,You're not American?
alejandro,No.
macy,Who do you work for now?
alejandro,I go where I'm sent.
macy,Where were you sent FROM?
alejandro,Cartagena.
macy,... Colombia?
matt, See if this fits.
macy, Is he CIA? Are you?
matt,Try it on.
macy,Well?
matt,"He's a DOD advisor, just like me."
macy,I'm not authorized to --
matt,Fine. Stay here.
macy,I just wanna know what I'm getting INTO --
matt,"You asked to get on this train. Because you KNOW you're not stopping anything in Phoenix. You're just sweeping up the mess. In six months, every house you raid will be rigged with explosives... You want to find the men responsible? This is where we start."
macy,So how nervous should I be?
agent,Are you kidding?
alejandro,Want to see Juarez?
macy, Yes.
alejandro,He wears the state police shirt. The pig -- Not what you think it means. All state police work for the cartels. ALL of them. That man... He tried to work for two... he got greedy.
agent,Hear that?
voice,Everybody hold on. Mexicans are adjusting our route. There's activity ahead we need to go around.
alejandro,"Nothing will happen here. If they try anything, it will be at the border. If no lane is cleared for us when we return... Be ready. Watch the cars. Look for old cars. Throw aways. Not gangster cars... Those are for the whores on Saturday night. Did you watch the cars we passed driving in?"
agent,NOW.
macy,Jesus.
agent,Okay. Go.
alejandro,On the left.
voice,We have a spotter on the left everyone. Keep your eyes out for a strike vehicle.
driver,Mexico holding a lane for us at the border?
voice,That's my understanding. We're trying to confirm...
alejandro,You have a service weapon?
macy,Yes.
alejandro,Get it out.
agent,Yep.
voice,"One lane over right, 5 o'clock. Burgundy Expedition."
voice2,"Three lanes over right, 1 o'clock, green honda civic."
macy,Okay... okay...
alejandro,"Gun. Buick LeSabre, 3 o'clock, gun."
voice2,What are the rules here?
voice,We must be engaged to engage.
voice2,Can we get out of this vehicle and set a perimeter?
voice,Stay in your vehicle. You can do what they do. If they get out you can get out.
alejandro, watch the door handles.
voice,"Get ready. They can see our lane clearing. If it's coming, it's coming now."
macy,Think... think...
agent,No it won't. It won't even make the paper in El Paso...
macy,JUST... Give me a minute.
matt,"Yeah. That got a little nutty, huh?"
macy,No. No. Don't... NO. This isn't ... This was a SPECIAL OP. You're a fucking spook. And HIM!! Who the fuck is that??
matt,Hey. I told you to stay here...
macy,"I'm not qualified for this. I'm good at what I do, but I'm not a soldier."
matt,"Don't sell yourself short. Reason Reggie's home is I know he's not ready for this, but he's gonna have to get ready real quick, because this is the future. Juarez is what happens when they dig in..."
macy,Don't put me in a situation where I have to break the law to stay alive. Don't do that to me.
steve,You wanna get cracking?
matt,"On that note, I think you better stay out here."
guillermo,NO HABLO-
matt,I love it when they don't hablo. Brought an old buddy of yours. Bet you `hablo' to him.
guillermo,El Medellin.
matt,"Alejandro, he remembers you."
dea agent,I'm gonna step out.
macy,Hey. Got another one of those?
macy,"Fireworks is code for something, I assume."
delta,Sort of.
macy,I don't hear anything.
delta,Can't. Too far away. Keep looking. They're everywhere.
macy,Unbelievable.
delta,"Madness, huh."
matt,"Can they get them all in one place? No... I'm on a clock now, I can't wait... No, contact Bob Fiske. Have him hold all of them at the staging center. How far is Tuscon?"
macy,From here? Little over two hours.
macy,We're going to Tucson?
matt,You gotta learn how to sleep on a plane.
reggie,"They let me on the base when this peckerwood needs a ride, don't they?"
macy,REGGIE-
matt," Has nothing to do with your race. I just don't believe you're good enough at your job yet to be of any use. Kate's sure fond of you, though."
reggie,"Thanks, man. I feel much better now."
macy,We're going to Tucson.
macy,Bad.
reggie,What happened?
macy,Now's not the time.
bob,"What's the deal, Matt? Why you holding up my transports?"
matt,We'll be quick.
bob,I have to feed these bastards when we hold em. Know how an internal auditor responds to an eight thousand dollar check to fucking Domino's Pizza?
matt,"You're so dramatic, Bob. This is Kate Macy with the FBI, and her partner `what's his name'... It was her call."
macy,I don't even know what we're doing here.  Got another one of those?
bob,Finish it before we get inside.
reggie,What happened in El Paso? Talk to me.
macy,We weren't in El Paso.
reggie,... Where were you?
macy,We were in Mexico.
bob,"There you go. I'm starting the buses. When you're done with em, send em out."
alejandro,All the women can go.
bob,"Coulda told me that on the phone, Matt."
matt,First I've heard it.
alejandro,Watch these men close. Look for the ones like the men you saw in Juarez.
macy,Him.
alejandro,Yes. Keep looking.
macy,Yeah. I see it.
matt,"Two ways to find drug routes. You can play cat and mouse with those clowns, or ask these guys what trails they avoid."
alejandro,"They see it all, and must avoid the traps set everywhere for them. We look for one who is older... one who has had enough."
bob,You done with these behind you?
matt,All yours.
alejandro,"Break them into groups of four, Let them spread out, each group as far from the other as possible."
reggie,What are we doing here? What were you doing in Mexico??
macy,"I'm with you, alright. I don't have answers."
reggie,"Well, let's get some then."
macy,You think I haven't asked these questions. Think you can do better? MATT. Can we talk to you for a minute?
matt,This feels very serious.
reggie,"What are we looking for? There's in the dark and then there's the way you're treating us. I want to know the objective, or I walk. Period."
matt,Then go. I didn't ask you to be a part of this. She did.
macy,I walk too.
matt,What would you like to know?
reggie,Everything.
matt,"Guillermo told us about a tunnel east of Nogales, near Sasabe. So now, we're trying to find what areas near there migrants avoid. Because that's where the tunnel will be. Better?"
reggie,Guillermo is...?
matt,I'm going back in.
macy,He TOLD you where a drug tunnel is... Just... Told you.
matt,Guillermo didn't have any other options. We send him back across the border and he's a dead man. Had to give us something.
macy,Bullshit.
reggie,"Look man, we have a boss, and you ain't him. Be straight. What are you doing?"
matt,We're going to make enough noise that Manuel Diaz is called back to Mexico to see HIS boss.
reggie,And then?
matt,And then we know where his boss is.
reggie,Alright... We're good. Just don't keep us in the dark.
alejandro,"There is only dark, my friend."
macy,What happens when you find him?
matt,It's been a humdinger of a day. Go home. Get some rest. We'll find a ride. See you tomorrow.
reggie,I just drove a hundred fucking miles...
macy,"This is a blessing, trust me. I want to stop and get some cigarettes."
reggie,Got you smoking again... it was that bad?
macy,Worse.
reggie,"Not that I think you should, but if you want cigarettes --"
macy,What's up?
reggie,You're phone's off.
macy,Yep.
reggie,We gotta go. Those spooks been calling me all morning.
macy,Want some coffee?
reggie,We gotta go.
macy,I have to get dressed. Come up.
reggie,"Gotta get you a new bra, woman."
macy,List of things I need is almost infinite.
reggie,Just saying. You gotta... some nice lacy something.
macy,"Been so long since anyone's seen me in a bra, except you... don't look at me like that. No pity, thank you."
reggie,How was seeing Evan the other day?
macy,...I don't know.
reggie,Miss him?
macy,Guy works eighty hours a week and thinks I'm too focused on my job.
reggie,Mmhmm. And what does that tell you?
macy,Ask me something else.
reggie,What was it like? On the border.
macy,It's broken ... The whole place. Just ... Lost.
reggie,Wish you hadn't volunteered for this.
macy,Me too. But... I have to know.
reggie,Know what?
macy,Could it get that bad here?
reggie,"Well, you sure picked the mother fuckers to show us."
macy,Yeah...
matt,Come on in.
alejandro,We should watch here.
migrant 1,"Oh yeah. For years, the best place to cross... right here."
macy,Are you getting this?
reggie,"Yeah. I don't believe it, but I understand what they're saying."
matt,Guillermo was telling the truth.
alejandro,This is our way across. Right here. Where do you live?
matt,How good is your Spanish?
macy,Not great.
reggie,Mine is. How did you get all this?
matt,Power of persuasion.
alejandro, Guillermo told the truth about everything.
matt,We're gonna have a good day. Let's send these guys home.
macy,Border patrol's not down there.
matt,Think they'd tell us all this and then go back to Mexico? You get one night's sleep and forget everything?
matt,Have friends at Phoenix SWAT?
macy,"Yeah, we use them for breeches when HRT is busy."
matt,They any good?
macy,Yeah... they get a lot of practice.
matt,"Got a new frame of reference for practice now, don't you. Let's give Phoenix SWAT a call, shall we?"
macy, What did you find out?
alejandro,We are close.
voice,We taking him when he makes the grab?
cory,Can we get in position?
matt,"When he walks out of the bank, we pull beside and you take him."
cory, Take him.
cory,"Little walking money, sport?"
macy,You guys coming?
alejandro,"Don't go in the bank, Kate."
macy,This is something I can actually build a case on.
matt,KATE --
macy,These are all Manuel Diaz's accounts?
macy,And you can seize that.
macy,What?
macy,No.
macy,Oh my god.
matt,"We knew where his accounts were, we just didn't know they were shaking people down in front of the fucking branch. It's a bogus bust, though. Can't prosecute it. No one controls who deposits money in an account. An attorney will have that money back in a few months... but a lot of heads will roll before then..."
macy,We can arrest Manuel for now. At least get him off the street.
matt,Don't you dare.
alejandro,"We need him to get called back to Mexico. That's the objective, Kate."
macy,That makes NO sense... We can get him off the street! RIGHT NOW. If I can tie any of these payments to--
matt,You can't arrest him.
macy,Watch me.
jennings,US Attorney won't issue the warrant. I can't override--
macy,This is ridiculous. His guys are robbing people IN FRONT OF THE BANK... So we find out where his boss lives in Mexico. Big deal. I've seen the Mexican police in action and believe me --
jennings,Kate... what do you want? What would you like done here?
macy,"I would like to follow some semblance of procedure, and build a prosecutable case against --"
jennings,"We prosecuted more felony drug cases in this region last year than in the two previous years combined. Are you feeling that on the street? You getting the `vibe' that we""re winning?"
macy,No.
jennings,Do you?
reggie,No... I don't.
phil,"Advisors like Matt come in, stir the pot, cause these criminals to react and make mistakes. That's how we build cases against the individuals that actually make a difference in this fight. When they're nervous, when they stop trusting their crews, when they move their money... these are all opportunities to strike... that's the purpose of contractors like Matt."
jennings,"This isn't something I dreamed up myself, Kate. I don't have the authority to hire advisors or authorize joint agency missions. Or fly agents from air force bases, are you understanding me? These decisions are made far from here. By officials elected to office, not appointed to them... so if your fear is operating out of bounds I am telling you, you're not. The boundary has been moved. Got it?"
macy,"Where'd that guy say the safe banks were, Cave Creek?"
reggie,Yeah?
macy,Ever been there?
reggie,Don't even know where it is...
macy,North of Scottsdale. Horse country...
reggie,Yeah?
macy,Big saloon there called the Buffalo Chip... Feel like a beer somewhere far away?
reggie,Why? There an angle here?
macy,Yeah. Angle is me getting drunk and forgetting about today.
reggie,At the Buffalo Chip? Yeah... I'll go to the Buffalo Chip. Get my two step on... Drive your drunk ass home later...
macy,Alright. To the Chip.
reggie,That fool's crazy.
macy,"These guys are pros, this is where they practice."
reggie,This what you do? Come here trolling for rednecks...
macy,Bet I start seeing you here weekly.
reggie,"I'll say this... these folks got it figured. Music's all.. bout life just... beating em, but still happy. Can't take that away from em."
macy,Let's go inside. I wanna dance.
reggie,Lit's git in thar an' boot scoot.
reggie,I think some of these girl's are getting drunk enough to forget they're racist.
macy,"Oh for God's sake, a Black man is president. Racism is dead, and even if it wasn't when he popped Bin Ladin he won over the hold outs."
reggie,"Yeah, baby."
macy,Who?
reggie,He's Phoenix PD.
macy, Really... Invite him over.
reggie,HEY! TED!
ted,I rode tonight.
reggie,A bull? No shit?
ted,Yeah. Were you watching?
reggie,"For a minute, how'd you do?"
ted,Tossed right out of the chute.  Hi.
reggie,"Sit down, man."
ted,"Let me grab you guys some beers, what is that?"
reggie,"Anything, man."
macy,Married?
reggie,All yours. In my basketball league.
macy,Good guy?
reggie,"He's great. Sergeant in vice. Divorced, couple kids I think..."
macy,Yeah... Thanks.
ted,You wrap this around and then-  I'll demonstrate.
reggie,I know where this is going --
macy,Don't discourage him. Know how long it's been since someone tied me up?
ted,Don't give me any ideas.
macy,I'm trying very hard to give you ideas.
ted, I want to take you outside.
macy,Okay.
ted,Scuse us. We're just gonna...
reggie,Mmhmm.
macy,Take a look around back.
reggie,Yeah.
ted,Watch my bag.
macy,What am I -- Uhh.
reggie,See you can also... let me show you...
girl,Okay...  Anything else fun in there?
reggie,Let's see...
girl,Did you two plan this??
reggie,Got a cell phone?
girl,Yeah... What?
reggie,"Call 911. Right fucking now, call"
macy,What are you doing???
reggie,He was sent here. There's surveillance photos of you IN HIS BAG!!! He works for the fucking cartel.
ted,Reggie... pull up my pants for me?
reggie,FUCK YOU.
ted,You got it wrong... nothing was gonna happen... wasn't... Didn't even know she--
jennings,See what I mean? They try to react and make mistakes... you want a LITTLE --
macy,No.
jennings,Then keep shaking the tree. Let's see what else falls.
macy,"Thank you, Dave."
jennings,"Thank you. Unlike most of the perps we see, Phoenix PD officers facing thirty years in prison have plenty to lose. We'll know whatever he knows very soon."
reggie,Thought all you white girls shaved.
macy,You saved my life.
reggie,"Nah. Think he was meant to scare you, or test you, maybe..."
macy,Are they following us?
reggie,"Don't know. They're gonna take your vehicle, look for a transmitter. Which would mean there's someone in our house involved too. "
macy,Thank you. I mean it.
reggie,Backseat of your car. With our shadows.
macy,I hope they kill him.
reggie,You don't mean that.
macy,... No.
ted,Okay. Okay. Okay...
matt,You said that Ted.
ted,Look... I. I. I was asked what her CASE INVOLVED-
matt,"The beauty of you being so beat to shit... No one's gonna notice a couple more scratches... this is a new game, Ted. "
ted,I'm in really fucking deep here.
alejandro,How many officers do they have on the force?
ted,I don't know... How do I guarantee my family's safe?
alejandro,You want the truth?
ted,Please.
alejandro,"Give the names, give the houses, phone numbers ... Give me all of you."
matt,Good job.
macy,I love how we're all going to pretend I planned this.
matt,You write it that way in the report.  Yes?
reggie,Well ... she found the picture and led him outside.
matt,"Real quick thinking, Kate."
macy,"Yeah ... So, can I go home tonight or ..."
matt,Sure ... This is good news. They're going to call Manuel back. Soon.
macy,Whoopee. Then we can call the Mexican police to go arrest their employer. Why do I think that won't happen?
matt, Gotta have a little faith.
reggie,You can come stay with me.
macy,"I'll be fine... They have your picture too, you know."
reggie,Yeah. Thought crossed my mind.
macy," I understand now, okay? They're everywhere and I'll never know who to trust, as evidenced by me fucking my hit man behind a bar."
alejandro,"He wasn't an assassin. He was just supposed to be your friend and hopefully find out who is showing you how to hurt them. They are looking for us, not you."
macy,That doesn't scare you?
alejandro,I've been doing this for a long time.

matt,"We may have the tunnel, right here."
macy,What's the plan?
matt, Going hunting.
delta,"Alright. Listen up. We're waiting for visual confirmation to move, so let's clarify the op. We will drive to this location. Proceed on foot to this ridge."
matt,We'll save that for later.
delta,This is an in and out. We are clearing and placing an agent. 
operator,This looks like confirmation.
delta,"That looks like it. Okay, let's gear up. Got a good drive ahead of us."
matt,"First thing, get that surveillance van operational."
operator,I need to fit your guy with a locator.
matt,Do it.
reggie,Those guys are Special Ops.  Are we going on this?
matt,You aren't really dressed for it.
reggie,"Well, you didn't fucking tell us."
matt,"You went crying to daddy yesterday. We don't want daddy to know everything. Loose lips sink ships, haven't you learned that yet? Don't worry, we got extra--"
macy,We have tac gear in our car.
reggie,What the fuck is he dressed for?
matt,"Relax. You guys will hang back when we get there, k?"
reggie,Then why are we going?
macy,Because CIA can't operate within US borders without a domestic agency attached. Right?
matt,"Hey. All the drugs we find, you guys get to confiscate. Gonna be a big day."
macy,That's why we're here. That's the only reason.
reggie,Great.
matt,What. What. What's he saying?
voice,Um. Hold on... They called him back. He's on the road now.
matt,Where.
voice,Turning left on Scottsdale. You got about three hours and he'll be across.
matt,We're gonna have to hit the tunnel the minute we get on the ground.
voice,"He's on I 10, travelling southeast..."
matt,On foot from here.
delta,"Keep your fucking safeties on and the barrels pointed down. Stay in the back and don't shoot anyone on my fucking team, got it?"
reggie,We HAVE done this before.
macy,I don't think we've done THIS.
delta,Rules of engagement on this deal?
alejandro,I don't use those. Ask Matt.
delta,Rules of engagement?
matt,"Weapons free, my friend."
voice,Bout twenty minutes to the border.
matt,We need to boogie. And we need to do it quiet till we find the center.
delta," So we're clear, I don't need to announce. Weapons free."
matt,They don't get freer buddy.
alejandro,Take the left shaft ... Make noise.
delta,Don't want us with you?
alejandro,No. Draw them to you. The one I am looking for will try and run.
matt,Cross this and it's new rules.
macy,Fair enough.
reggie,Fuck are we doing in here? Let's go back.
macy,THEN GO BACK.
silvio,RAPIDO RAPIDO!!!
bandit,Traiga me contigo!!!
silvio,No cabron!
alejandro,Put that down.
macy,STEP AWAY. I mean it. Move away from him.
alejandro,We are in Mexico now. You have no jurisdiction.
macy,We can't be here--
alejandro,Don't ever point a weapon at me again. Get your breath and go back to the surface.
macy,You lured Manuel to Mexico so you could kill him. This is your cab driver.
alejandro,"I am here to kill the man with the power to summon Manuel Diaz. I am here for Fausto. But I will kill Manuel too. It's what I do, Kate. Go. Or I will do it to you."
voice,Copy. We have you. Target is east and north of you. Looks like highway 56 to 17 will intercept him if he stays on 17. Will advise. Go
alejandro, Este a calle cinquinta y seis.
sylvio,I have a son... I... have a son.
alejandro,Having family... does that save the lives of the men you are hired to kill? Hmm?
matt, Is he through?
voice,Copy. GPS is transmitting. Audio is transmitting. Should intercept in
matt,"This was a clean, clean fucking op my friend."
delta,Except for these assholes. Like it better overseas where we don't have baby sitters.
reggie,You see Kate?
matt,She's not with you?
reggie,We gotta go back.
matt,"Okay, let's go. We're missing one."
reggie,"Hey man, what the --"
delta,"Just lay back, baby. Let it happen."
macy,He's an assassin. A government ASSASSIN--
matt,Our government doesn't have assassins. We farm that out.
macy,Who is Medellin?? What is that?
matt,Refers to a time when one group controlled every aspect of the drug trade. Providing a measure of order. That we can control. 
macy,He works for the cartels in Colombia... He works for the fucking competition.
matt,"He works for whoever points him toward the people that made him, Kate. Us, them, anyone that will turn him loose."
macy,Get away from me.
matt,Take a breath and --
macy,Fucking kill me or get out of my way.
matt,Long walk back to Phoenix.
macy,I'll manage.
reggie,What just happened?
macy,They woke me up. Showed me the whole thing.
reggie,And?
macy,And I quit.
alejandro, This is the target ahead? Confirm.
voice,"Copy. Black Range Rover, 60 meters ahead."
alejandro,Put on your lights. Pull the car over.
manuel,"What the fuck. Want to bribe me, eh."
alejandro,Use the speaker. Tell him to get out of the car.
silvio,Afuera del carro!!
manuel,This mother fucker...
alejandro,Tell him to raise his shirt and turn around.
silvio,Levanta su camisa.
manuel,You know who I am? HUH??
alejandro,Tell him to do it or you will shoot him where he stands.
silvio,Voy a matarse cabron. Levanta tu camisa.
alejandro,Look how good you are at pretending to be a police officer. Out of the car. Now.
manuel,Who was he?
alejandro,A mule. Like you.
manuel,You know... who .. The.. I AM A JEFE!!!
alejandro,"I know who you are, Manuel. You are no jefe, but you will drive me to one..."
manuel,Soy Manuel Diaz.
guard,"Si, te conosco. El Jefe esta esperando."
alejandro,Drive.
manuel,What happens when we get to the house?
alejandro,You get out and walk toward them.
manuel,What will happen to me?
alejandro,What you do now is for your family. There is no you.
manuel,You think you are so different?
alejandro,No. Not anymore. Now I am the same. Turn the car a bit more to the left.
guard 2,"Senor, buenos noches."
manuel,CUIDADO HOMBRES--
jacinta,"RAPIDO, MAMA!, tengo hambre!"
alejandro,SIENTATE! AQUI!!
fausto,No.
alejandro,Then we will spare them. I interrupted dinner. Please... Continue.
fausto,I take shame.
jacinta,Do it. You fuck. Chinga tu madre PUNTA CABRON ANDALE PUES!!!
alejandro,See why you married her. Spunk.
eliseo,Mama?
macy,Three days ago I hadn't had you in ten years... fucker.
macy,Please.
alejandro,Let me look ... Move your hand.
macy,You're an assassin.
alejandro,"In Mexico, the killers are called Sicarios... The word comes from the zealots of Jerusalem. Killers who hunted the Romans that invaded their homeland... They don't deserve the term."
macy,You are a Sicario.
alejandro,Policing them does nothing. They must be killed. Wherever they are found. They will make every place they touch Juarez. Now ... Now you understand how far we have fallen.
alejandro,"There is a moment in each person's life. A choice. Do what feels good... Do what is good. Make the wrong choice enough, and it is not presented again... then all choices are bad. And the consequences worse. There is no war on drugs. Only war. The enemy we fight? Ourselves ..."
