astronaut's voice," So ends my last signal until we reach our destination. We are now on automatic, a mere hundred and five light years from our base ... and at the mercy of com- puters. I've tucked in my crew for the long sleep. I'll join them presently."
astronaut,"Within the hour we shall complete the sixth month of our flight from Cape Kennedy. By our time, that is ..."
astronaut's voice," But according to Dr. Hasslein theory of time in a vehicle traveling at close to the speed of light, old Mother Earth has aged a few thousand years since our de- parture -- while we have scarcely aged at all."
taylor,Dodge! Read the atmosphere!
taylor,Landon! Send a last signal.
landon, What signal?
landon,It's no use ... there she goes.
taylor,Forget it. Abandon ship.
dodge, Briny...twenty-five percent salinity. Near the saturation point.
landon, She's still sinking...
taylor, We're here to stay.
dodge's voice, Too red for Bellatrix.
taylor, We've enough food and water for three days.
dodge,But how long is a day?
taylor, Landon! Join the expedition.
landon, I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
taylor, Air leak. Died in her sleep.
landon,long pause) You know it.
taylor,"It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better."
taylor,Any sign of dangerous ionization?
dodge,No.
dodge,Which direction?
taylor, That way.
dodge,Any particular reason?
taylor,Everybody all right?
landon,If only we could get a fix.
landon," Climb off me, will you!"
landon,Taylor.    I'm telling you --
taylor,"Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me, you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid. How does it taste?"
landon, Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
taylor,But I'm not prepared to die.
dodge,"It's a stream bed., no doubt about it -- but bone dry."
taylor, Never mind the scarecrows.
landon, Can we take a dip?
taylor, Okay.
landon,My God..they look almost human.
taylor,Show them we're friendly.
taylor,No cigar.
landon,Try telling them our names.
taylor,"Well, if we're looking for an icebreaker...  Listen, folks ....."
taylor,"Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us."
dodge,Blessed are the vegetarians.
landon,We got off at the wrong stop.
taylor,"You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet."
dodge, Look...
landon,Think they'll attack us?
ape photographer,Smile.
galen,Him.
zira,Will he live?
galen, There's no probe here. Find one!
nurse,"Yes, sir."
zira,"This place is dirty, doctor."
zira,"What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority."
galen,Hmph.
julius,Simmer down!  You especially.
julius,"Good morning, Dr. Zira."
zira,"Do we want some sugar, old-timer?"
zira,Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
zira,"Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?"
taylor," Listen, listen -- I can speak --"
zira," Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?"
taylor, I'm not pretending! I can talk!
zira, Did you see that? It's remarkable!
julius,Huh?
zira,He's trying to form words.
julius,"Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do."
julius,Now what?
zira,He seems to want something.
julius,"I'd be careful, doctor."
taylor, What's the matter with you? I can talk! Can't you see that?
zira,"Bright Eyes, show him! Go ahead! Do your trick!"
zira,Speak! Go on.    Speak again.
taylor, My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
zira,I wonder how held score on a Hopkins manual dexterity test?
zaius,An animal?
julius,Look!
zira,He's moving his fingers!
zaius,Of course. He saw you moving yours.
zira,But perhaps he understood --
zira's voice, I beg to disagree. According to my exper- iments --
zaius,It's a question of simian survival.
ape guard,"Is this the one you wanted, Doctor?"
zira,Put her in with him.
cornelius,Do you have to work tonight?
zira,"Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?"
cornelius,Remembers what?
zira,The blood transfusion.
zira, Something's bothering him. He's been prying around the lab for the last two days ...
zaius,"Oh, yes -- the young ape with a shovel. I hear you're planning another archeological expedition."
zaius' voice," The project will require my support, of course."
cornelius' voice," I hope I can count on it, sir."
zaius' voice," A friendly warning, Cornelius -- when you're digging for artifacts, don't bury your reputation."
a voice, Guards!
zaius,That man can be domesticated.
zira,"I'm sorry, Bright Eyes."
julius,I told you what you'd get!
zira," Julius, don't. It doesn't matter."
cornelius, It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
zira,"Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?"
cornelius, Where did you learn to do this?
zira, 'And you're a fool'.
cornelius,"Now, just a minute --"
zira,"Oh, Cornelius, be quiet."
zira, 'Not fell -- flew!'
cornelius,Flight is a scientific impossibility.
zira,"And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?"
cornelius," Well, now..."
zira, 'Do you have maps?'
cornelius,We are here ...  You were captured about here.
cornelius, Out - of - the - question!.
zira," 'Then how do you account for me?,"
cornelius, It's probably wrong --
cornelius,The evidence was very meager --
zira,You didn't think so then.
zira,'I am not a missing link.'
cornelius,"No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle."
zira,"Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!"
cornelius, Dr. Zaius --
zaius," Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?"
cornelius,"Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes."
maximus,What is that?
zira,"A man, Dr. Maximus."
zira,"Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case."
maximus,Why special?
zira,"Yes, Sir."
maximus,Return this beast to the compound.
zaius' voice, What's this?
zira,A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
cornelius, Zira....
zaius,Nonsense.
julius' voice," What's up, Lieutenant?"
minister's voice, The dear departed once said to me: 'I never met an ape I didn't like'...
child, Look!. It's a man!
minister,In Heaven's name ...  Get rid of that creature.
first chimp,You see what I saw?
second chimp,Must've escaped from the zoo.
taylor,Dodge ...
zira,"Taylor, why'd you run away?"
zira, I'm in charge of this man.
taylor,"Get away from me, you dirty ape!"
taylor,Let her alone!
taylor," Take your hands off her, you black monster! You filth!"
julius,Turn it off!
taylor,Answer me!
taylor,Where's Dr. Zira? Why--?
julius,I said shut up!
taylor, Ape! Apes wearing clothes! It's a madhouse! A madhouse!
taylor, It's probably just as well she didn't live to see this.
taylor,I wonder if it's Love between us.  What a place to find it.
zira,Shhhh!
taylor,What is this?
zira,A hearing.
bailiff,Be seated.
president," You may proceed, Dr. Honorius."
maximus," And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him."
president,"Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?"
zira,He is unlike any man you have ever seen - as we hope to prove.
honorius' voice, Objection!
zira, Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
zaius,This man is not being tried. He is being disposed of.  It is scientific heresy that is actually on trial here.
maximus,"Well put, Dr. Zaius. Let us warn our friends that they endanger their own careers by defending this animal."
taylor,Then I'll defend myself.
president,Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
president,It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
president, Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
president,"Come to the point, Dr. Honorius."
zira, Thats a lie!
president," Mind your tongue, madame."
zira,Did we create his mind too? Not only can this man speak. He can write. He can reason.
honorius,"He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination."
president,Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
taylor, Show this to the President.
zira," 'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."""
president, Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
president, This is a joke in very poor taste.
zira,Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
zaius, Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
zira,"I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does."
zira," Like you, I find it difficult."
zira,This is his assertion.
zaius,Where are they now?
taylor, One is in a museum!
president, Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
zaius,"How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?"
zira,He doesn't know.
zaius,"Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes."
zira,Which one?
taylor,With one of them.
taylor,Landon?
zira,"No, I swear -- I never saw this man before."
taylor, You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
president,"Silence!  Bailiff, take the prisoner inside!"
cornelius,"May it please the Tribunal: I for one grant that this being cannot have come from another planet. But this much is certain -- he comes from somewhere in the Forbidden Zone. He has described the region to us, and described it accurately, for I have been there."
president,Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
zaius," Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk."
president,How so?
honorius,Objection!
president,Sustained.
zira, Their speech organs are adequate. The flaw lies not in anatomy but in the brain.
honorius,Objection!
president,Sustained.
zira," Sustain all objections, but face the truth!"
president, You have gone too far.
zaius," There you are, Mr. President. I warned you these two would use this hearing as a forum for subversion."
taylor,What about me?
zaius, And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
taylor,No.
zaius,"Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death."
zaius,"However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you."
zaius,You lied. Where is your tribe?
zaius,Certainly not.    You're a mutant.
zaius, Of course.
taylor," All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?"
taylor,Then you admit --
taylor," Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?"
zaius," Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?"
taylor,"All right, you can cut me to pieces. It's within your power.  But know this, doctor. You do it because you're afraid of me. You do it from fear!"
lucius,Are you Julius?
julius,What do you want?
lucius,I'm from the Office of Animal Affairs.  This male's to be transferred to the zoo.
julius,At this hour? Who says so?
lucius,Hit him!
lucius, Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
taylor,Come on. Get me out of here.
taylor,She comes along too.
lucius,Zira doesn't want your female.
taylor,I want her.
lucius, If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
taylor,Fine. Just let her out.
zira, I told you not to bring the other one.
zira, Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
taylor,Listen-
lucius, Gorilla hunters ...
lucius,Stand back! He's dangerous!
first hunter,Why?
zira,He's rabid! His bite is fatal!
first hunter,You serious?
lucius,You would die in agony!  Frothing at the mouth!
cornelius,How did it go?
cornelius," Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now."
taylor,Do you have any weapons?
cornelius,The best. But we won't need them.
taylor,"Just the same, I want one."
taylor,Fair enough. But you're no longer in charge of me. And I don't mean to be captured again.
taylor,"You still don't believe me, do you?"
taylor,"I know ... Nevertheless, I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there."
taylor, We can't stay there. It's not safe.
cornelius,Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
zira, Are you going to take her with you?
taylor,Yes.
taylor,Maybe not.
zira,The Hunt Club.
cornelius,"To scare us, too. We're entering the Forbidden Zone."
taylor,You can do it. Like this ...
lucius,Something's wrong with your mate.
taylor,Where does the river lead?
taylor's voice, And beyond that?
taylor,I'm for that.
zira,She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
taylor,"So I'm not an altogether different breed, you see?"
taylor,In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
cornelius,Lucius -- don't fire at them.
taylor,Shut up.
zaius,Very well.  Lower your weapons.
taylor,On this planet -- it's easy.
taylor, And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
zira," Taylor, please --"
zaius, There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
taylor," All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test."
taylor,No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
zaius, What is your proposal?
zaius,Of course.
taylor,Okay.Up to the cave.
taylor,Relax. You'll see it all later.
zaius,"Present your evidence, Cornelius."
zaius, Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
cornelius,I apologize.
zaius,What?
cornelius, Right there. The human doll.
cornelius," No sir, I haven't forgotten."
zaius,Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets.    Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed. Keep digging Cornelius. You'll find evidence of the master of this house: an ape.
cornelius, What are you doing there?
taylor," Well, whoever owned them was in pretty bad shape."
taylor,Defective eyesight..
zira,Lucius....
taylor,You louse!
taylor,Tell him to pull back!
taylor,I ought to kill you right now.  Let's go.
cornelius, They've taken everything.
lucius,Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
taylor," All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders."
lucius, What is it?
lucius," Yes, I can do that."
lucius,What if they won't agree to your terms?
taylor,Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
zaius, Deliver the message.
taylor,Sit down. Over there.
taylor," Now,     Minister of Science - let me explain certain principle stress and strain. If you exert pressure to remove these bonds, you'll choke yourself to death. It'll be suicide, you see?"
taylor,Why not?
taylor," He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet."
taylor," Defender of the Faith. Guardian of the terrible secret. Isn't that right, doctor?"
taylor,Stay where you     are!
taylor, And my nose.
zira,But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
taylor,Sure.    In a cage.
taylor,"No, thanks. I'll take freedom."
taylor,Would you like to come along?
zira,We can't.
taylor,It's better than going to prison for heresy.
cornelius,They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
taylor,God bless you.
taylor,Lucius.
lucius,I think you're making a mistake.
lucius,What?
marcus,"Yes, sir."
cornelius, Seal the cave?
zaius,That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
zira,But the proof? The doll?
cornelius,You mustn't! You gave your 'word!
zaius,"What I do, I do with no pleasure. Silence him."
zaius,I may just have saved it for you.
lucius,"What will he find out there, doctor?"
zaius,His destiny.
taylor,"Yes, Nova -- I see it.  In my old profession green meant safe. Green meant go."
taylor, My God!
