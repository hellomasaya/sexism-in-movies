annie,I can't remember being this excited about anything.  I want to be a teacher when I finish at Southern State.  I guess I've always wanted to work with children.  I hate it when people call 'em kids.  Sounds like little goats.
annie," The job market for teachers is supposed to be the pits these days, but I don't care.  When you have a dream as long as I have, you'll do anything..."
annie, Wasn't that Camp Crystal Lake?  Just back there?

ned,There you are dead wrong.
jack,Ha!
ned,Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
jack,Ow!
ned,I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake.  Besides yourself.
marcie,"You are a true pierce of work, Ned."
marcie, How about our last jay?
jack,Good call.
ned,What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
jack,Quote:  Controlled substances are expressly forbidden.  Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal.  Unquote.
marcie,"We got two weeks before the kids even arrive.  Then I'll act responsibly. Until then, hit me."
marcie,It's beautiful...
ned,"Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years."
steve,Wanta give me a hand here?
steve, Alice?
steve, Wanta roll this sucker out of the way. Alice?
alice,Cabin B is ready.
steve,"Push on this side.  Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned.  Push."
steve," That's got her.  Thanks.  I'm Steve Christy.  Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes?  Climb into 'em.  Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse.  I want him to start with the canoes.  What happened to Brenda?"
alice,You told her to sweep the courts.
steve,"I'd rather she painted.  Let's go, folks."
ned,I thought we had two weeks...
alice,You can changed in three.
alice,Steve said for you to start on the boats.
bill,I finished the boats.
alice,I'll tell him.
bill,Alice?  The others show up?
alice,Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen.  Annie.
bill,You think you're gonna last all summer?
alice,I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
steve,Shim it up just a scooch.
steve, Perfection.  Hold it.
steve," To answer your question, my parents once owned this camp.  There were some tragic accidents and they went bankrupt.  I promised them I'd reopen if I could. See if it closes right now."
ned,Looks good.
steve,Perfection. Did you meet Brenda?
steve," She's archery.  He's rifle ranged.  And I'm behind schedule.  Let's go, Ned."
steve,Come on back here and let's above the float in.
marcie,What are those for?  An Indian raid?
jack,Steve's got a woodlore program.  You see any life rings?
marcie,"Here.  Meet me in my cabin after taps. Okay, Camper?"
jack,For sure.
steve,You draw very well.
alice,"Oh, thanks.  I wish I could spend more time at it."
steve,"This isn't your cup of tea, hunh?"
steve, Any particular reason?
alice,Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
steve, You want to leave?
alice,I don't know.  Probably be best for everybody.
steve,"You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life.  It's been my whole life.  Gimme a chance.  Stay a week.  Help get it ready.  Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful."
alice,Next Friday.
steve,"Thanks, Alice."
steve," I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten.  If you're still up, we can talk, okay?"

steve,"Yeah.  Brenda, after lunch hit the archery range.  If Annie gets here, have her start in on the kitchen.  Do your best.  Tomorrow we have a preliminary inspection by the state safety people. I'd like to look good."
ned,"He neglected to mention this place is called ""Camp Blood"" downtown."
alice,How come?
ned,Some campers drowned.  Then some counsellors got killed.
bill,No shit.  When?
ned,Late fifties sometime.  They never caught the guy who did it either.
marcie,Neddy collects weird facts.  Next he is going to tell us that there are poisonous snakes in the outhouse and green lizards in the lake.

brenda," You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry."
ned,"God, but I love that sexy talk."
bill,Sorry.  How you doing?
alice,Did you want something?
bill,Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
alice,Un-hunh.
alice," Oh, my God..."
bill,You okay?
bill, You're lucky.
bill, How come you're leaving?
alice,It's long and personal.  It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
bill,Maybe I can help?
alice,"And it's this place.  It makes no sense, but it spooks me."
bill, You're right.  It makes no sense.

ned, See?  I'm getting to you.  Very slowly.
alice,What'd you see?
brenda,I don't know.  Marcie's got me paranoid.
bill,It still hurts?
alice,"I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain.  We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife."
bill,What'll you do when you leave here?
alice,I don't know.
marcie,"Pistachio, fudge ripple, creme de menthe and I are going back to work."
bill,"Speaking as black raspberry, I guess I'm ready.  Frozen yogurt?  ALICE smiles at the reference."
alice,I'll be along.
ned," Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out..."

alice,Now I'm only eleven hours behind schedule.  Steve is going to have a small cow.

alice," There's a fucking snake in here.  BILL sees it.  He freezes, then takes a step forward. Carefully, he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the machete, cutting the snake into two pieces.  Blood spurts onto the floor."
marcie,"Steve never mentioned serpents.  Jack, would you get some paper towels?"
alice,How the... did he get in there?
bill,Slipped in.  Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
marcie,Thanks.
bill,You okay now?
marcie,Go ahead.  I walk on 'em all the time.  Would you shovel Mr. Snake outta here?
cut to:, 59    EXT. CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON
marcie,How you doin'?
alice,Okay.  Can I help?
brenda,It's catch as catch can.  I'm making a salad.  The guys are planning to cook greaseburgers for themselves.
marcie,There's a lot of dishes if you just want something to do.
alice,"The way I feel, that's perfect."
jack,It's gonna be a long summer.
ned,"Wait, wait!   When I was finding these goodies in the shed.  I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen."
ned," Dear Mom and Dad, Camp Blood is real fine except for the strange man who flies at night and sucks our counsellor's body..."
ned," And, Mommy, we really love our counsellor. He says that whenever I'm scared, I can sleep in his bunk with him."
ned, No wonder they lost America.  How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that?  What's to eat?
brenda,Whatever you make yourself.
ned,The squaws are revolting!
bill,Trouble?
alice,Bad bulb or no power.  It's getting a little gloomy in here.
jack,Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator.  The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
ned,"God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators!  The Indian used campfires."
jack,Give me a hand?
bill,For sure.
bill,This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
jack,Here we go.
jack, Now ya' close the switch.
jack,I'll be okay.  Holy shit...
bill,Don't get up.  Take a second...
jack,You saved my life.
bill,I had to.
jack,Thanks.
bill,I figured if I didn't save you.  I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
jack,Whew.
bill,This puddle was enough to ground you all the way to China.
jack,Floor probably leaks.  This area is full of springs.
bill,A short somewhere.
bill," There's the problem, Jack.  Wire worked itself loose."
jack,Just in cause this bugger goes bad.  I'm gonna pick up some lanterns from the equipment shack.
ned,What hath God wrought?
brenda,That was the telephone.
ned,"Ha!  You wily oriental!  The phone was ""Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you."" ""What hath God wrought"" was the telegraph."
marcie,Last line of Gone With the Wind?
ned,"Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!"
brenda,Shows how much you know.  It's something about tomorrow.
alice,Tomorrow is another day.
brenda,Right!  Right!
alice,This just plain ain't my day.
brenda,Wash it out real good.
bill,Lemme see.  Doesn't look too bad.
ned,Who played the role of Gorgon in Star Trek?
alice,Somebody probably dropped something too hard.
ned,"Alice, you're just lucky there are no snakes in the dishwater here."
marcie,"Soooooeeeeey, piggy, piggy."
jack,What is it?
bill,Is it stuck?
ned,Ta-da!  REACTION SHOTS: as it sinks in that NED has been putting them on.
jack,"Not funny, Ned..."
marcie,Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
ned,"But it's in the brochure!  ""Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program.""  You just saw it."
bill,Chance to get even?
jack,I'll spot you five points.
ned,"Hey, look, I'm sorry.  I'll never do it again."
ned, I'm sorry.
alice,"Ned?  We're gonna be working together for a while.  You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?"
ned,Tell 'em I'm sorry?
alice,Sure.
ned,"I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's.  Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice."
alice,You're welcome.
marcie,I hope that's the last time we see the Camp Crystal Lake Drama Program.
ned,Hello?  Can I help you?
jack,You just had some lucky shots.
bill,Where's Ned?
alice,He went to bed early.
marcie,I don't blame him.
brenda,He's probably setting up another one of his practical jokes.
marcie,"Yeah, like draining the lake!"
jack," Hey, how about a walk by the lake?"
jack," Just a walk, for Chrissakes."
marcie," Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you."
jack,Wind's up.  It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
marcie,Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
jack,I love you.
marcie,I love you.
marcie, What about Neddy?
jack,I don't love Neddy.
marcie,He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
jack, Ned!
marcie,Don't call him.
jack,"I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures.  Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know."
marcie,I guess...
jack,Looks like a storm.
marcie,I'm a little scared of storms.  Always have been.  Since I was a kid.
jack,You?  The brick?
marcie,I've dreamed this dream.  Maybe half a dozen times.  There is a thunderstorm. The rain comes down like pebbles.  I can hear the sound.  I try to close my ears off.  It doesn't work.  The sounds gets louder.  The rain turns to blood and the blood washes down in little rivers.  And the sound stops.
jack,It's just a dream.
marcie,I call it my shower dream.
jack,This is no dream.  Want to escape for a while?
marcie,Lead the way!
marcie,Are you wet?
jack,"Just a little.  Wait a minute, woman."
alice,Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
bill,Not if they're where I think they are.
alice,I'm not always this stupid.
marcie,Mmmmmmmph?
jack,Mmmmmmmph.
marcie,Best over...
jack,Umhummmmph.
marcie,Like waves.  It's never been likes waves before.
jack,Whassamatta?
marcie,Gotta pee.  You're lying on my bladder.
marcie," I know this ain't very romantic, but what can I say?  I don't want to explode."
marcie," ""Forty yards to the outhouse by Willie Makit.""  ""The Yellow Stream by I.P. Daley.""  Not the most original stuff, kids."
marcie, Jack?
marcie,Jack?
marcie, Jack?  Neddy?  Don't put me on.
marcie, Allee allee infree!
marcie, Must be my imagination.
sandy,Anything else you want?
steve,"No, thanks.  I'm fine.  Sandy."
sandy,You can't go back there tonight.  Not in that stuff.  'Less you wanta get drownded.
steve, I got to.
sandy,Aw.
steve,I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
sandy,They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
sandy,One night on the town.
steve,I mean...
sandy,...I know what you mean.  Two and a quarter.  Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
sandy, You got a roof for that Jeep?
steve,Yeah.  I got it on before this--  --all started.
sandy,That's thirty percent.
steve,For two lonely nights.
sandy,"Drive careful and don't drownd your dumb self.  STEVE smiles and leaves.  She watches, then counts her changes and sticks it her pocket with the rest of her tips for the day."
brenda,You think they fell asleep?
bill,Anything's possible.  My parents taught me to leave sleeping lovers alone.
alice,It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon.  It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
bill,Good point.
alice,"Well, it hasn't been that long."
brenda,Long enough for me.
alice,I think we should go wake them up.  Just in case.
brenda,"Give them a little while longer.  It's still early, anyway."
alice,I guess...

bill,Got to it just in time.  The generator was running on fumes.  I filled it up. That should keep it humming until Steve gets back.
brenda,"Good night, Alice."
alice,"Good night, Brenda."
bill,Help you clean up?
alice,Absolutely.
tierney,I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
steve,I think water got into the electrical system.  You ride me back to camp?  I'll get one of my counsellors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
tierney,Why not?
tierney," ""To serve and protect"" don't mean to chauffeur.  He puts the car in gear and roars into the night."
brenda,That could drive a person bug-city.
brenda,"Neddy?  Cut the screwing around, Neddy!"
brenda, This isn't even half funny.

bill,Where?
alice,They're off now.
bill,I'll go check on Brenda.
alice,Okay.
alice, I'll go with you.
bill,If it'll make you feel better.
tierney,"Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th.  They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon.  It affects people.  Makes 'em nuts."
steve,You've made a science out of coincidence.
tierney,This is Tierney.
tierney,Roger.  Acknowledge receipt.  Estimate arrival time fifteen minutes.  How copy?

steve,Sure.  STEVE gets out quickly.

bill, It's dead.  Try the pay phone.
alice,Do you have a dime?  A quarter?
bill,No.  There must be some in the desk somewhere.
alice,What's the matter with it?
bill,Wet.  I don't know.
alice,Why don't we run?  Just run now?
bill,It's over twenty miles to the crossroads.  Steve'll be back in an hour.  Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
