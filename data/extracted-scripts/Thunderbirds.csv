Speaker,Dialogue
narrator,"From a secret island in the South Pacific, the courageous Tracy family run an organization called International Rescue. When disaster strikes, anywhere in the world, they are always first on the scene. They go by the name they gave their incredible machines, the Thunderbirds.   Five, four, three, two, one. Thunderbirds are go!"
teacher,"So, gentlemen, we all know that A2 plus B2 equals... C2, that's right. But what happens when we bring in Leonardo Da Vinci's E, F and...  Mr. Tracy!"
fermat,Alan. Alan!
teacher,"How kind of you to come back from outer space, Alan. I trust re-entry wasn't too rough?"
alan tracy,I was just...
teacher,"Apparently not  ""Thunderbirds are go.""  Well, I hope you aren't going anywhere special over spring break, Alan. Because I expect a 10,000 word paper on my desk the day you get back. That should keep you busy."
alan," ""That should keep you busy. Yeah, well you can take your 10,000 words and stick them right up your..."""
fermat,Alan!
alan,Headmaster.
headmaster,Mr. Tracy!
alan,Miss Garrett.
fermat,You gotta be more careful Alan.
alan,Why can't I tell 'em I'm a Thunderbird Fermat?
fermat,"Because technically you're not a Thunderbirds yet. And if your identity was discovered, it would a d-d-di- it could be very bad."
alan,"I know, I know."
excited kid,It's the Thunderbirds. They're gonna be on TV. Let's go! They're gonna be on TV.
alan,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Where are they?
excited kid,"In Russia, at an oil rig fire."
alan,Great! I'm stuck at school and my brothers are on another cool mission.
fermat,Wanna watch?
alan,Yeah!
lisa lowe,We are told this super-rig is now in danger of total collapse.  And there is real concern for the lives of six men who remain trapped on board.  An emergency call went out to the Thunderbirds just a few minutes ago. They should be here any moment now.   And here they are!
scott tracy,"Thunderbird 2 this is Thunderbird 1. I have visual, south"
jeff tracy,FAB. We'll take it from here.
mullion,Come on! Come on!
jeff,"Scott, get out. That tower's coming down."
scott,Got it.
jeff,Thunderbird 1 any damage?
scott,"Negative, Dad."
alan,"Come on, come on! Swing around. You can't get close enough, taking that approach angle."
jeff,This approach angle's no good. Gonna have to swing her around.
jeff,"Scotty, I was watching for wind shear when you were still wearing diapers."
alan,"Come on, Dad."
jeff,Whoa! Hold on!
scott,"Who needs the diapers now, Dad?"
fermat,What do they do now?
alan,Probably drop the rescue platform from
virgil tracy,Open 'em up. Here we go. Rescue platform's on its way.
jeff,"Virgil, how's it going?"
virgil,"It's looking good, Dad."
crew member,Come on! Jump!
virgil,"Okay, I've got a visual. Hold it there. Targets locked. Firing rescue lines. (Directed toward the"
crew member,READY
jeff,"Alright, let's haul them out."
fermat,Commencing reverse thrust.
jeff,"Okay, let's bring 'em home."
crew member,Look out! 
alan,Man they gotta get 'em out fast. That rig's gonna blow.
crew member,Hang on!  Boys watching the TV gasp as the crew goes down back toward the water a little bit
jeff,"Whoa sorry, boys. Hold on tight. Here we go."
alan,"Come on, Virgil."
virgil,Hold on guys
jeff,"How you doing, son?"
virgil,Never better
jeff,"Thunderbird 1, commence knockdown procedure."
scott,"FAB, Thunderbird 2.  Lining up target."
jeff,"Bull's-eye! Outstanding shot. All right boys, let's take these babies home."
lisa lowe,As you can see the fire has been extinguished. The rocket fired from Thunderbird 1 has
chuck,"That was great work, Lisa. Thanks a lot."
alan,"That's another good one, diaper boy."
headmaster,Tracy!  There's someone here for you.
fermat,Sure beats the bus!
alan,Definitely!
lady penelope,"Fantastic. Now, will any of these gorgeous young things be joining you?"
alan,Just Fermat.
lady penelope,Quite right.
alan,"Lady Penelope, why are you in America? Are you on a mission for my father?"
lady penelope,"Alan, shh! I am an undercover agent, so please try to be discreet. (camera pans over to"
fermat,"Hi, Parker."
parker,"Good afternoon, Master Hackenbacker."
alan,"Hi, Nosey."
parker,"Less of that attitude, or I shall be obliged to deliver the Parker Haymaker."
alan,"Okay, bring it on, big guy."
lady penelope,"Try not to run over any children, Parker."
parker,"Very good, milady."
lady penelope,"Come on, Parker, chop chop!"
alan,All right!
fermat,Whoa!
alan,YES!
fermat,Yeah! the boys high five
lady penelope," Oh, look, Parker. Pink is the new black this season."
parker,"I'm very glad to hear it, milady."
lady penelope,And hemlines are going up.
parker,"That is good news, milady."
lady penelope,Oh and apparently England won the football last night.
parker,Yes! Eng-er-land! 
lady penelope,"Calm down, Parker."
parker,"Yes, milady. Sorry, milady."
panhead's mother,"Come on, baby. Out you jump. (Turns to her teenage son who has a pan stuck on"
panhead,Even better! It's the Thunderbirds!
virgil,"OK, lock it up. Let's go. Let's move it. Hey, we need some help over here."
jeff,Mission complete. Thunderbird 1 we are good to go.
scott,FAB.
the hood,"Ah, the chariot of the gods. Having dallied with the mortals,"
parker,"Pardon me, milady. Approaching Tracy Island. And radar indicates we have some company."
lady penelope,"Now, that's showing off."
alan,I wish that was me.
brains,"I'm about to run post flight checks, Mr Tracy. Anything I sh-sh-sh-"
jeff,"Brains, I noticed a build-up of vibration on Thunderbird 2, followed by illumination of the number 5"
brains,"Okay, Mr. Tracy, I'll ch-ch-ch-study the flight data and guidance processor."
alan,Dad!
jeff,Alan! Let me look at you. He hold Alan at arm's length and then looks him over. He then looks
virgil,Hey Sprout! ruffles his hair
scott,ruffles his hair Hey Buddy!
onaha,Dinner's ready. Come and get it.
jeff,"Onaha, it smells delicious. I am starved."
alan,"So Dad, I saw the mission on TV. It looked dangerous."
jeff,Saving lives is a dangerous business. But it's what we do.
alan,Do you think the fire was caused by thermal up draughts? I mean that would explain the-- (Jeff
jeff,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, enough shop talk. I want to hear about school."
alan,"School's boring. Plus I've been thinking, maybe I could be home-educated now. That way, I could"
jeff,"No short cuts, Alan. No school, no rockets. Say, why aren't you wearing your retainer?"
scott,"So I'm getting the reading telling me that the wind is blowing 60 knots, right up my keister."
virgil,No kidding.
alan,Did you try readjust the flaps?
scott,"Well that's the first thing I did, Sprout! It's not my first day in a Thunderbird you know."
gordon,Try and keep up!
virgil,Yeah and don't you have homework to do or something?
gordon,"Unless he's blown up this school, like the last one!"
scott,"Yeah, keep Alan away from the ships, he's a hazard."
jeff,"Okay, that's enough. Pass the salad."
virgil,"Man, I haven't seen that much fire since that volcano in Fiji."
scott,That wasn't Fiji that was Istanbul.
virgil,"No, no, Istanbul was the earthquake."
scott,"Yeah well, nothing compares to Argentina."
alan,"Dad, I'm not really hungry. Come on, Fermat. Let's go."
fermat,But! I'm not done!  Okay.
jeff,"Kyrano, have you seen Lady P?"
kyrano,By the pool.
jeff,Of course.
lady penelope, Parker.
fermat,We're not supposed to go in there. We could get in trouble.
alan,"Ah, you worry too much."
fermat,Where'd you get the access code for Thunderbird 1 anyway?
alan,"Fermat, my friend, what you don't know, can't hurt you."
lady penelope,I'll be right there. It seems the fire at the oil rig was no accident.
jeff,Any suspects?
lady penelope,"Not yet, but I'll keep you posted."
alan,Thanks for bringing Alan home.
lady penelope,My pleasure. Any excuse to visit paradise.
jeff,Tintin!
tintin,"Hey, Mr. Tracy."
lady penelope,"Hello, Tintin."
tintin,"Good evening, Lady Penelope."
jeff,Did you know Alan's home?
tintin," I mean, oh,"
jeff,When are those two going to get along?
lady penelope,When Tintin decides the time is right. Girls always fire ahead of boys with that sort of
jeff,What sort of thing?
lady penelope, Romance.
jeff,Alan and Tintin? I didn't see that one coming.
lady penelope,"No, you wouldn't."
jeff,"Have a safe flight home, Penny."
lady penelope,"Thanks, Jeff."
alan,"Okay, Fermat. Run pre-flight checks."
fermat,Right. Hydraulic systems are green.
alan,Commence main engine sequence.
fermat,"FAB, Alan."
alan,Couldn't hurt to just fire up the instruments.
fermat,"No wait, Alan! That's the Wrong switch!"
alan,Oh God. (There is loud beeping coming from the control panel and the boys can't shut down
jeff," Alan, my office. Now. (Thunderbird 1 shuts"
fermat,It just did.  The boys walk out of Thunderbird 1 and are walking toward the silo door. Fermat is running his hand
alan,I can't believe it.
fermat,We're so b-b-busted.
fermat,Look at this.
alan,What is it?
fermat,"Looks like some sort of, gallium-electrolyte compound."
alan,We gotta get out of here.
alan,"Dad, I know you're mad. I shouldn't have been in the ship, but if you just give me a minute to"
jeff,You're damn right you shouldn't have been in there!
alan,"But, nothing happened Dad. I had it under control."
jeff,Under control? Do you have any idea of the importance of secrecy in our operation? You fired up
alan,"Yeah, I understand. I understand you don't want me to be a Thunderbird. You don't want me to"
jeff,I've heard enough. You're grounded for the rest of spring break.
alan,"But, Dad!"
jeff,"Bottom line, Alan. You need to grow up."
alan,Then let me.  Please!
jeff,"Hey, John. I was just about to turn in. What can I do for you?"
john tracy,I could sure use a pizza. You know a place that delivers?
jeff,"30 minutes or it's free, right? Anything else on your mind?"
john,"Well, got a forest fire in Vladivostok, a typhoon heading for Singapore. What's happening on"
jeff,Alan's home for spring break.
john,"Yeah, I thought I could see a storm brewing in your region."
jeff,Teenagers.
john,"Well, we've all been there. And Dad, you've done a great job since Mom died."
jeff,"Thanks, John. Keep an eye on that typhoon for us. And, uh, I'll call Vladivostok, see if they need"
john,"FAB, Dad. Sleep tight."
fermat,"Morning, Dad."
brains,"Hey, son. There's something I'd like to sh-sh-sh- Here, take a look."
fermat,The neural-net control system?
brains,It's great to have you back. I bet you didn't think spring break was going to be this w- w-fun.
brains,"And that tiny phone lifts up, perfect."
fermat,Dad?
brains,N-n-n- Almost perfect.
fermat,There's something I want to talk to you about.
brains,"Oh. Right. Oh. OK, right. You're having problems with a g-g-g-chi-chi-chi-wo-wo-female?"
fermat,N-no! No. Alan and I found some sort of gallium compound on the nosecone of Thunderbird
brains,We should check that out st-st-st-immediately.
fermat,That'd be g-g-g-swell!  Scene skips to Alan skipping rocks at the beach. The camera follows one rock and it leads to a

the hood,"Transom, I need you."
transom,"Yes, sir. Sir, our cloaking device has evaded their detection"
the hood,Mullion.
mullion,"Sir? Sir, armed and ready. Shall I target the main structure?"
the hood,Why would I want to destroy what will soon be mine? One of the principle tenets of Eastern

the hood, Cut them off.
transom,Activating communications blackout.
brains,What the he-he-devil is going on?
brains,"Mr. Tracy, do you copy?"
brains,Thunderbird 3 please respond.
alan,How'd they find the island? Do you think it was what I did in Thunderbird 1? Do you think I ruined
fermat,No! That compound we found could have some sort of transmitting capability.
tintin,We have to do something.
fermat,"My dad's in the control room, but how do we get there now?"
alan,The vents. Let's go! We have to get a message to my dad.
john,"I'm losing all power. Repeat, I'm losing all power."
jeff,"Hold on, John. We're coming in. Gordon, prepare for immediate docking."
gordon,"You got it, Dad. Reverse main thrusters on my mark. Three, two, one."
jeff,Easy. Watch the roll.
virgil,Roll index angle minus two degrees.
gordon,We're locked on.
jeff,Nice work
scott,Tunnel hatch secured.
jeff,Emergency packs boys. Let's move!
jeff,We're in. Let's go!
jeff,"John! Scott, tackle that fire."
john,Am I glad to see you guys!
jeff,"Easy, you're hurt. Virgil, take care of your brother. Gordon, give me a damage assessment."
alan,"Come on, hurry!"
transom,"One-inch steel plate, with sequential titanium locking mechanism."
fermat,Watch out for the guards.
alan,"Get in, get in."
brains, Who-o-o-o- What's going on?
the hood,"So, this is Mount Olympus. And these are the Thunderbirds. I should have guessed. Jeff"
alan, Just keep going straight ahead.
tintin, Okay.
transom,Professor Hackenbacker? We met at last year's international conference on

transom,"Sorry, sir. The command control switch, is here. Fingerprint recognition system."
the hood,Professor. Please. Activate the control switch.

brains,Fu-Fu-Fu- No way!
the hood,"Activate the control switch, Prof!  Like a puppet on"
transom,We have control.
mullion, Get up.
transom,"Sorry, Professor. Nothing personal."
scott,We got a warning light on our EPS system.
jeff,Attempt manual override.
scott,"No, that's negative!"
alan,That's it.
fermat,"Okay, this one."
jeff,"Back to Thunderbird 3 now.  John, we gotta move."
gordon,The locking mechanism's jammed!
the hood,"Attention, Thunderbird 5. As you can see I have taken over your facilities. You no longer"
alan,They've taken over.
the hood,"Warm them up, Transom."
transom,Increasing temperature to maximum.
alan,Who's the bald freak?
kyrano,You? The Hood uses his powers on him and he falls down clutching his head.
tintin,Dad!
fermat,They've got m-my dad.
jeff,"Okay, you have our attention. Who are you? What do you want?"
the hood,"Oh how rude of me. You can call me The Hood. Now, listen, Mr. Tracy. We won't be"
scott,You'll never get away with it.
jeff,Why the Thunderbirds?
the hood,"An eye for an eye, Mr. Tracy."
jeff,An eye for an eye?

kyrano,Turns to the video phone that the Hood has been using to communicate with Thunderbird

jeff,"Wait!  Scott, status report."
scott,CO2 levels are rising.
jeff,"Alright, wire the oxygen scrubber to the emergency batteries. Clean the air."
virgil,How long will that give us?
john,About four hours.
mullion,"Someone's there. (Mullion walks over to the ceiling, he is standing directly below where"
tintin,Run! Run!
alan,"No, jump! We can get through to the silos."

transom," Here they are. Thunderbird 2 silo, in the"
the hood, Seal them in.
alan,Hold on!
tintin,"The doors! You guys, let's go! C'mon"
fermat,Go! Go!
alan,This way. 
fermat, No!
tintin,They've got us trapped. What now?
fermat,"If we can get to the Thunderbird 1's silo, we can escape through the service tunnel. But we"
alan,I'll use the Thunderizer on the door.
alan,You guys get the goons with the Firefly!
fermat,Alan! This equipment is only to be used in an emergency.  I
alan,Yeah.
tintin,"Here they come. Fermat, can you drive this thing?"
fermat,"Uh, no."
tintin,"Hey, watch it!"
fermat,"I took microbiology, not driver's ed. Set the pressure to maximum."
tintin,Got it.
mullion, Retreat!
tintin,Let's move it.
alan,That's it. Time to thunderize.  Yes!
alan,"Come on, let's go!"
mullion,Get 'em!
alan,Where's Fermat?
tintin,Fermat!
alan,Fermat!
fermat,Coming!
alan,"Hurry up.  What were you doing back there,"
fermat,I had an-n-n idea.
alan,"Just try and keep up, okay? I'll open the tunnel. We gotta keep moving. (Alan types in a pass"
the hood,Alan. You can run if you want. Were you surprised to hear what your father did to me? It is

the hood,"Don't, give him the satisfaction, Professor. This is taking too long. Pick out the equipment"
mullion,"Yes, sir.  Scene switches to the children trying to get onto the beach, they are getting knocked over by a couple"
fermat,How about a little warning next time you pull a stunt like that?
alan,"Relax, Fermat. It's just a little water."
fermat,I could have drowned.
alan,You mean you can't swim?!
fermat,"I repeat, I could have drowned."
alan,"I said I was sorry, Fermat. Just put this behind us, Okay? We gotta watch each other's backs."
fermat,Thank you.
tintin,Boo!
alan,"No, c'mon Tintin, stay there."
tintin,You're worse than a couple of girls. Hurry up and get dressed.  Those are nice
fermat,"Data from Tracy Island is sent to Thunderbird 5 via satellite, right?"
alan,Right.
fermat,"So, there's a miniscule possibility that if we reach the satellite station, we could"
alan,Blow it up!
fermat,"No, we could hack in to it and give"
alan,"Good thinking, Fermat. Alright, let's do it.  Here's the"
tintin,"Good. Except that we're here, not there, and the transmitter is there, not here. We have to go"
fermat,But that's f-f- off limits.
tintin,It's gonna be dangerous.

fermat,"Actually, he's not going anywhere for now."
alan,The guidance processor for Thunderbird 2. You can't take off without it. Fermat you're a genius.
fermat,"Alan, my friend, what you don't know, can't hurt you."
lady penelope,Parker?
parker,Milady?
lady penelope,We have an emergency.
lady penelope,What a charming fellow.
lady penelope,Come in.
lady penelope,"Have a look at this, Parker.  He, and this"
parker,"Sounds like an alias, milady."
lady penelope,"Quite right, Parker. Real name: Trangh Belagant. Assumed dead when"
parker,"Milady, that's Mr. Tracy's loyal manservant, Kyrano."
lady penelope,"How's my schedule, Parker?"
parker,"You have clay pigeon shooting with Lord Marlborough, a benefit gala for the Institute of the"
lady penelope,I suppose that's urgent.
parker,"Yes, milady. There was also a bridge collapsed in Buenos Aires and a volcanic eruption in"
lady penelope,The Thunderbirds haven't responded?
parker,"No, milady. And the media is awash in speculation vis--vis their whereabouts. Parker turns on"
chuck,Over to Lisa Lowe.
lisa lowe,"Chuck, disaster after disaster around the world today and still no sight of the Thunderbirds."
lady penelope,"I think it's time to send the emergency signal, Parker."
parker,"I fear you're not wrong, milady."
lisa lowe,"Lisa Lowe. Back to you, Chuck."
alan,"I'm telling you, Fermat, it was like The Hood was inside my head back there."
fermat,"What do you mean, Alan?"
alan,Maybe he can read minds or control minds or something.
fermat,"Don't be silly, Alan. Everything can be explained by science."
alan,"I'm just trying to figure out his weakness. Everybody has an Achilles heel, right?"
fermat,My Achilles heel is actually my Achilles heel. It's got a blister the size of a basketball. Tintin!
tintin,Stop?
fermat,Yes!
tintin,No!
fermat, Okay.
alan," No more cheeseburgers for you, Fermat."
lady penelope,Any word?
parker,"Nothing, milady."
lady penelope,Right. You will have to tell Lord Marlborough that I've broken my shooting arm. We
parker,"Yes, milady."
lady penelope,"The Thunderbirds appear to be in a spot of trouble. And I don't like that. Let's go,"
mullion,Ready for launch. We'll use this to get into the vaults.
the hood,"Subtle, as usual, Mullion."
mullion,"I didn't realize we'd be getting points for style. We're robbing banks, remember."
the hood,Don't worry. You'll get your money.
mullion," Transom, initiate pre-flight"
mullion,What's going on?
transom,It's the guidance processor.
mullion,What's wrong with it?
transom,There isn't one.
mullion,Aaargh!
the hood,Clever Alan. It's the children. They have it.
mullion,No way. They're dead. No one could live through something like that.
the hood,"I did. Get them, Mullion. Take whatever you need. And make sure you get the guidance"
fermat,"Alan, don't you think Tintin is blossoming?"
alan,Blossoming?! What's that supposed to mean?
fermat,"Come on, Alan. You've a c-crush on her."
alan,"You've got to be kidding. I mean, she's. She's not that bad, I guess."
tintin," Okay, guys, take five."
fermat,Five isn't going to do it!
tintin,Guys?
tintin,Don't move.
fermat, Whoa
alan,What is it?
tintin,Hexdrotilous scorpion.
alan,Is that dangerous?
fermat,.025 milligrams of its venom is fatal.
alan,"So, dangerous is in fact an understatement."
fermat,Watch out!
alan,"Tintin, what was that?"
tintin,Let's get going.
alan,"Hey! She has the same powers as her uncle, The Hood."
fermat,You think?
alan,Must run in the family. Did you do that?
tintin,"Just drop it, okay?"
alan,Still think everything can be explained by science?
fermat,Not girls!
jeff,Scott? Gordon? You all right?
gordon,We're okay.
scott,The heat exchanger has blown.
jeff,You don't say.
mullion,Come on! Those brats are in here somewhere.
alan,How we doing Fermat?
fermat,Don't rush me Alan. This is very d-delicate equipment.  Which is
alan,Can you fix it?
fermat,"Yea- Maybe, but I'll need something to solder with."
alan,"We're in the middle of nowhere Fermat, where are you going to find something like that. (Tintin"
alan,Ow!
fermat,Perfect.
tintin,"Gee Alan, I never figured you for a crybaby."
alan,I'm gonna kill you.
fermat,What'd he say?
tintin,I think it was some sort of apology.
fermat,"I got it, yes! Y-y-you the man, Fermat! Okay, first step is to establish contact with Thunderbird"
alan,Dad?
john,It's Alan!
jeff,"Alan, where are you? Are you safe?"
alan,I'm at the satellite relay station with Fermat and Tintin. Fermat's gonna hack into the main
jeff,We're standing by.
fermat,"Okay, we're almost there."
transom,"Goodness me, Professor. You're so good-looking without your glasses on. I think you may"
transom,Oh now that's not fair. Just when things were starting to sizzle.
transom, A burst of transmission from the island's satellite station.
the hood,And give Mullion the coordinates.
transom,"Take the main track southeast, then head up Satellite Hill."
fermat,They're onto us! We're being jammed!
alan,Can you finish?
fermat,I'll try.
jeff," Alan, what's happening?"
alan,"Hang in there Dad, one more minute, okay?"
fermat,It's not going to work Alan. The signal's too weak for data transmission.
alan,"Dad, can you hear me? They're jamming the signal. We're going to lose you. Don't worry, I'll"
jeff,That's a negative! It's too dangerous. Follow emergency procedure. Wait for Lady Penelope at the
alan,Dad!
jeff,Alan we're losing you! Alan!
alan,Dad!
fermat,No!
alan,Useless!
fermat,It is now.
tintin,"I'm sorry, Alan. This is hard on all of us."
alan,"No, it's okay. I'm fine."
fermat,You don't have to be such a tough guy Alan. I'm worried about my dad too.
tintin,I'd do anything to be with my parents right now.
alan,But The Hood knows we're alive now. We have to go.
fermat,"Even worse, they know exactly"
fermat,Where we are!  Mullion and the other guards watch the kids running down the hillside for a second.
mullion,Come on!
fermat,"Great, more water."
alan,"Tintin, can you slow 'em down?"
tintin,I'd be delighted.
alan,"Then do it. And meet us at the junk yard. Come on, Fermat."
alan,This'll get us out of here.
mullion,There! Come on!
mullion,Straight ahead.
fermat,It's gonna make this thing hard to control you know.
alan,No problem.
fermat,You really must be careful not to exceed four bars of boost or else
alan,I said no problem.
tintin,"Guys, let's go we've got to get out of here. What is this?"
fermat,It's a hoversled.
alan,"It's our ticket out, unless you've got a better idea."
tintin,"Yeah, let's wait for Lady Penelope, like your dad said."
fermat, Here.

parker," This seems to be a six-lever mortise, milady."
lady penelope,I love it when your checkered past comes in handy Parker.
parker,"Thank you, milady. Unfortunately, I fear I shall need a piece of wire to access the mechanism."
