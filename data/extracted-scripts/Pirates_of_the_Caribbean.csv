Speaker,Dialogue
elizabeth,"...drink up me hearties, yo, ho..."
gibbs," Quiet, missy! Cursed pirates sail these waters. You want to call 'em down on us?"
norrington,Mr. Gibbs.
gibbs,"She was singing about pirates. Bad luck to sing about pirates, with us mired in this unnatural fog-- mark my words."
norrington,Consider them marked.   On your way.
gibbs,"'Aye, Captain.  Bad luck to have a woman on board, too. Even a mini'ture one."
elizabeth,I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
norrington,"Think again, Miss Swan.   Vile and dissolute creatures, the  lot of them. I intend to see to   it that any man who sails under a  pirate flag, or wears a pirates  brand, gets what he deserves: a  short drop and a sudden stop."
swan,"Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter."
norrington,"My apologies, Governor."
elizabeth,"Actually, I find it all fascinating."
elizabeth,"Yes, father."
norrington,Man overboard!
elizabeth,Boy overboard!
norrington,Fetch a hook! Haul him out of there!
gibbs,Mary mother of God ...
swan,What happened here?
norrington,An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
gibbs,Lot of good it did them...  Everyone's thinking it! I'm just saying it! Pirates!
swan,"There is no proof of that. It could have been an accident. Captain, these men were protection. If there is even the slightest chance one of those poor devils is still alive, we cannot abandon them!"
norrington,"Of course not, Governor.  Move the boy aft. We'll need the deck clear."
swan,"Elizabeth, I want you to accompany the boy. He's in your charge now. You'll watch over him?"
elizabeth,My name is Elizabeth Swann.
will,Will Turner.
elizabeth,"I'm watching over you, Will."
norrington,Did he speak?
elizabeth,His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
norrington,Very good.
elizabeth,Yes -- yes.
swann,Still abed at this hour?    It's a beautiful day!
swann,Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
swann,Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
elizabeth,I knew it.
swann,"Or, rather, Commodore Norrington...a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know."
elizabeth,Difficult ... to say.
elizabeth, Women in London must have learned to not breath.
butler,Governor? A caller is here for you.
swann,"Ah, Mr. Turner! It's good to see you again!"
will,"Good day, sir.  I have your order."
swann,"Impressive. .. very impressive. Commodore Norrington will be pleased, I'm sure. Do pass my compliments on to your master."
will, I shall. A craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated --
swann,Elizabeth! You look stunning!
elizabeth,Will! It's so good to see you!
swann,"Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate -"
elizabeth, About the day we met. Do you remember?
will,"I could never forget it, Miss Swann."
elizabeth,"Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?"
will,"At least once more, Miss Swann. As always."
swann,"Well said! There's a boy who understands propriety. Now, we must be going."
elizabeth,"Good day, Mr. Turner."
will,Good day.
swann,"Dear, I do hope you demonstrate a bit more decorum in front of Commodore Norrington. After all, it is only"
harbormaster,"If you're out rolling scuppers in this tub, you're either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid."
jack,It's remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
harbormaster,"It's a shilling for the dock space, and you're going to have to give me your name."
jack,"What do you say to three shillings, and we forget the name?"
harbormaster,"Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith."
murtogg,This dock is off-limits to civilians.
jack,"Sorry, I didn't know."
murtogg,No ... someone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
jack,This must be some important boat.
mullroy,Ship.
jack,Ship.
murtogg,Captain Norrington's made it his flagship. He'll use it to hunt down the last dregs of piracy on the Spanish Lake.
mullroy,Commodore.
murtogg,Right. Commodore Norrington.
jack,"That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superfluous."
murtogg,"Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed."
jack,"That so? I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, nigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?"
murtogg,The Black Pearl is a real ship.
mullroy,"No, it's not."
murtogg,Yes it is. I've seen it.
murtogg,Yes.
mullroy,You've seen the Black Pearl?
murtogg,Yes.
murtogg,"Yes, I have."
murtogg,... No .
mullroy,No.
murtogg,But I've seen a ship with black sails.
murtogg,... no.
jack,I'm sorry. It's just such a pretty boat. Ship.
murtogg,What's your name?
jack,Smith.
murtogg,And no lies!
jack,"None? Very well. You've rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go out on the account, do a little honest pirating."
murtogg,"I said, no lies."
murtogg,He's not telling the truth.
mullroy,He may be.
murtogg,If he were telling the truth he wouldn't have told us.
jack,"Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't believe the truth if he told it to you."
norrington,May I have a moment?
elizabeth,I can't breathe.
gillette,"The rocks, sir! It's a miracle she missed them!"
jack,Aren't you going to save her?
jack, Sailors.
mullroy,Not breathing.
mullroy,I never would have thought of that.
jack,"Clearly, you've never been to Singapore."
norrington,On your feet.
swann,Elizabeth! Are you all right?
elizabeth,"Yes -- yes, I'm fine -- Commodore Norrington, do you intend to kill my rescuer?"
norrington,I believe thanks are in order.
jack,Captain Jack Sparrow. If you please.
norrington,I don't see your ship -- Captain.
murtogg,He said he'd come to commandeer one.
mullroy," These are his, sir."
norrington," Extra powder, but no additional shot."
jack,"Ah, but you have heard of me."
norrington,"Carefully, lieutenant."
elizabeth,"Commodore, I must protest. Pirate or not, this man saved my life."
norrington,One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
jack,But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
norrington, Indeed.
jack,Finally.
jack,"Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?"
elizabeth, You are despicable.
jack,I saved your life; now you've saved mine. We're square.
norrington,"On his heels! Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!"
elizabeth,"Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine! Go capture him."
swann,"Here, dear ... you should wear this."
elizabeth,"Thank you, Father ... and let that be the last of your fashion advice, please."
will,Right where I left you.
jack,You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
will,I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
jack,Ah. Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record. So if you'll excuse me ...
will,You threatened Miss Swann.
jack,Only a little.
will,I do. And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
jack,You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
will,No. I practice three hours a day so that when I meet a pirate ... I can kill him.
will,No.
jack,Move!
will,No. I can not just step aside and let you escape.
jack,"You're lucky, boy -- this shot's not meant for you."
norrington,"Excellent work, Mister Brown. You've aided in the capture of a dangerous fugitive."
brown,Just doing my civic duty.
norrington,I believe you will always remember this as the day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.
brown,That ratter broke my bottle.
elizabeth,"Nice and toasty. Thank you, Estrellia."
prisoner,"Come here, boy... Want a nice, juicy bone?"
jack,"You can keep doing that forever, that dog's never going to move."
prisoner,Excuse us if we ain't resigned ourselves to the gallows just yet.
swann,Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
norrington,No. She hasn't.
swann,"Well, she had a taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight."
norrington,Bleak. Very bleak.
swann,What was that?
norrington,Cannon fire!
jack,I know those guns!
prisoner, The Black Pearl? I've heard stories ... she's been preying on ships and settlements for near ten years ... and never leaves any survivors.
jack,There are a lot of stories about the Black Pearl.
norrington,Governor! Barricade yourself in my office!  That's an order!
pintel,Up there!
estrella,Miss Elizabeth?
elizabeth,"Listen, Estrella -- they haven't seen you. Hide, and first chance, run for the fort ."
pintel,"We know you're here, poppet. Come out and we promise we won't hurt you."
elizabeth,"Please, no ..."
pintel,What?
elizabeth,"Parlay! I invoke the right of parlay! According to"" the Code of the Brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!"
pintel,I know the code.
elizabeth,"If an adversary demands parley, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete."
pintel,"It would appear, so do you."
smoldering pirate,To blazes with the code!
pintel,"She wants to be taken to the Captain, and she'll go without a fuss."
prisioner,Praise be!
jack,"It's all right, doggie ... come here,"
twigg,This isn't the armory.
koehler," Well, well... Look what we have here, Twigg. It's. Captain Sparrow."
twigg,"Huh. Last time I saw you, you were all alone on a God-forsaken island, shrinking into the distance. I'd heard you'd gotten off, but I didn't believe it."
koehler,Did you sprout little wings and flyaway?
twigg,His fortunes aren't improved much.
jack,Worry about your own fortunes. The lowest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers ... and mutineers.
koehler,You know nothing of hell.
bosun,I didn't know we was taking captives.
pintel,She's invoked the right of parlay... with Captain Barbossa.
elizabeth,I am here to --
bosun,You'll speak when spoken to!
barbossa,And you'll not lay a hand on those under the protection of parlay!
bosun,"Aye, sir."
elizabeth,Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
barbossa,"There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates. What is it you want?"
elizabeth,I want you to leave. And never come back.
barbossa,I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means' No. '
elizabeth,Very well.
barbossa,My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
elizabeth,Because it's what you're searching for. You've been searching for it for years. I recognize this ship.
barbossa," Did you, now?"
elizabeth,"Fine. I suppose if this is worthless, there's no reason to keep it."
barbossa,NO!
elizabeth,Elizabeth -  Barbossa reacts to the name Turner: it confirms what he has suspected. The other pirates surreptitiously exchange glances and nods.
barbossa,"You've got sand, for a maid."
elizabeth," Thank you, sir."
elizabeth,"Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean."
barbossa,"No, no, nothing like that.  Very well. You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return."
elizabeth,Can I trust you?
barbossa,"It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!"
elizabeth,Our bargain. . ?
bosun,"Still the guns, and stow 'em! Signal the men, set the flags, and make good to clear port!"
elizabeth,Wait! You must return me to shore! According to the rules of the Order of the Brethren -
barbossa,"First. Your return to shore was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement, and so I 'must' do nothing. Secondly: you must be a pirate for the pirate's code to apply. And you're not. And thirdly..."
will,Miss Swann! Elizabeth!
will,They've taken her! They've taken Elizabeth!
norrington,We're aware of the situation.
will,We have to hunt them down -- and save her!
swann,"Where do you propose we start? If you have any information that concerns my daughter, then share it! If anyone does, tell me!  Leave, Mr. Turner."
murtogg,That Jack Sparrow... he talked about the Black Pearl.
mullroy,"Mentioned it, is more what he did."
murtogg,Still --
will,We can ask him where it is -- maybe he can lead us to it!
will,We could strike a bargain -
norrington,"No. The pirates who invaded   this fort left Sparrow locked in   his cell. Ergo, he is not their   ally, and therefore of no value.  We will determine their most likely course, and launch a   search mission that sails with the   tide."
will,That's not good enough. This is Elizabeth's life!
norrington,"Mr. Turner, this is not the time for rash actions.  Now, go home."
will,Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
jack,Somewhat.
will,Where does it make berth?
jack,Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
will,The ship's real enough. So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
jack,Why ask me?
will,Because you're a pirate.
jack,And you want to turn pirate yourself?
will,Never.  They took Miss Swann.
jack," So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone. I see no profit in it for me."
will,I can get you out of here.
jack,How? The key's run off.
will," I helped build these cells. Those are hook-and-ring hinges. The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free. Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum. . ."
jack,Your name is Turner.
will,Yes. Will Turner.
jack,Will Turner...  Do we have an accord?
will,Agreed.
jack,Agreed!
will,Someone will have heard that. Hurry.
jack,Not without my effects.
will,We need to go!
jack,"My business, Will. As for your business -one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you? How far are you willing to go to save her?"
will, I'd die for her.
jack,Good.
will,"I haven't set foot off dry land I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy."
jack,No worries there. She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
will,We're going to steal a ship? That ship?
jack,Commandeer. We're going to commandeer a ship. Nautical term.
will,It's still against the law.
will,"This is either crazy, or brilliant."
jack,Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
jack,Everybody stay calm. We're taking over the ship!
will, Aye! Avast!
jack,Dead serious.
gillette,You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men. You'll never make it out of the bay.
jack,We'll see about that.
gillette,"Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise."
jack,"Fine by me. We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound."
gillette," Agreed. You have the momentary advantage, sir. But I will see you smile from the yard arm sir."
jack,"As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!"
jack,A little help?
murtogg,I can't believe he's doing this.
mullroy,"You didn't believe he was telling the truth, either."
gillette," Do you have any idea, boy, what you're doing?"
will,No.
jack,"Lookee there, mate! We're underway!"
swann,Commodore --
norrington,A moment.
swann,But --
norrington,Please.
swann,"Dammit, man, it appears someone is stealing your ship!"
norrington,"Rash, Turner, too rash."
will,They're coming!
norrington,"Search every cabin, every hold, down to the bilges!"
jack,Can you swim?  Can. You. Swim?
sentry,"Of course, sir. Like a fish. I grew up summers living in Dover, with my uncle -"
jack,Good.
norrington,Sailors! Back to the Interceptor!
jack,"Thank you, Commodore, for getting our ship ready to make way! We'd've had a hard time of it by ourselves!"
norrington,Raise the sails.
gillette,"The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them."
norrington,"We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines."
gillette,Hands! Come about! Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
norrington,Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
steersman,"Captain, there's a problem."
norrington,So it would seem.
gillette,He's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen.
norrington,So it would seem.
pintel,"You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this."
elizabeth,Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
pintel," He said you say that! He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked."
barbossa,"Maid or not, it fits you."
barbossa,"Now, none of that. Please dig in."
elizabeth,It's poisoned!
barbossa,"Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner."
elizabeth,Then why aren't you eating?
barbossa,Would that I could.
elizabeth,It's a pirate medallion.
barbossa,It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta .
elizabeth,"That's all very interesting, but I hardly believe in ghost stories any more."
barbossa,"You idiot girl! It's no make- believe! My crew and I, we found the gold, and we did more than take one piece, we took it all. Rich men we were and we spent it and traded it and gave it away in exchange"
barbossa,Look!  LOOK! The moonlight shows us for what we really are! We are not among the living and so we cannot die -
jack,"For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study."
will,"I worked passage   from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother  passed, I came out here ... looking  for my father."
jack,Is that so?
will,My father. William Turner?
jack,"I knew him. Probably one of the few who knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill."
will,'Bootstrap?'
jack,"Good man. Good pirate. And clever -""- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin."
will, That's not true.
jack,"I swear, you look just like him."
will,It's not true that my father was a pirate.
jack,Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
will,"He was a merchant marine! He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--"
jack," You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable"
will,My father did not think of my mother -his family -- as a burden.
jack,Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
will,My father -- was not -- a pirate!
jack,"Put it away, Will. It's not worth getting beat again."
will,"You didn't beat me. You ignored the rules of engagement. In a fair fight, I'd kill you."
jack,"Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?"
will,Tortuga?
jack,Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
will,Just do it quickly.
jack, Don't worry. I've already got my Quartermaster -- there!
anamaria,You stole my boat.
jack,AnaMaria! Have you seen Gibbs? I need to put together -
anamaria,My dory. The Jolly Mon. Where is it?
jack,Safe! At Port Royal. With the Royal Navy.
anamaria,That boat is my livelihood!
jack,You'll get it back. Or one better.
anamaria, I will.
will,Jack! Over here!
gibbs,"Curse you for breathing, you slack-jawed idiot  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping. It's bad luck!"
jack,"Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition."
gibbs,"Aye, that'll about do it."
will,I know. That was for the smell.
jack,Just the one.
gibbs,"Make it_ast, then. Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?"
gibbs,"Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx."
jack,"Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?"
gibbs,Say again?
jack,"Ilm going after the Black Pearl. I know where its going to be, and I'm going to take it."
gibbs,"Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl."
jack,"Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to. All I need is a crew."
gibbs, A fool's errand.
gibbs,"And you've got that, have you?"
jack,"Back there, guarding the door is the son of old Bootstrap Bill Turner."
gibbs,"Well, lookee there. I'll allow you may be onto something, Jack.  There's bound to be sailors on this rock crazy as you. I'll find some men."
jack,That he is.
gibbs,"Feast your eyes, Cap'n. All of 'em good sea-faring men, faithful hands before the mast, every one worth his salt --"
anamaria,You owe me a boat.
gibbs,"Cotton here is mute, sir. Poor devil had his tongue cut out --"
jack,"Mr. Cotton. Do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true, in the face danger, and almost certain death?"
cotton's parrot,Wind in your SAILS! Wind in your SAILS!
gibbs,"Mostly, that seem to mean 'yes.'"
will,"Shut up, before you lose them all!"
jack,These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them-
gibbs,"That fool will have us lose the canvas, and the masts besides!"
jack,She can hold a bit longer.
gibbs, What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
jack, We're catching up!
twigg,"Isla de Muerta! Isla de Muerta, off the port bow!"
jacoby,"Orders, Captain?"
barbossa,"Bring her in, not too close. I won't brave the reef, not until high tide. We lay anchor before dark."
jack,Bear three points starboard.
gibbs,"Left handed-ropes are coiled against the sun, or it's bad luck!  Anty-clockwise."
gibbs,"Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lie."
will,Really?  So ... what's the story on the pistol?
gibbs,"I'll tell lee. Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts. This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl -"
will,What? He never told me that.
gibbs,"Ah -- he's learned, then. Plays things more close to the vest. See, Jack was a cartographer, back in Old England. Somehow I he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew, promised each man an equal share.  That night, there was mutiny."
will,How did he get off the island?
jack, I didn't!
gibbs,How did you get off the island?
jack,"Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold."
will,Wait -- what about the pistol?
jack,"The pistol. When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot. No good for hunting, or surviving, really. But after three weeks of starvation and thirst -- the option of that pistol begins to look good."
koehler,"Moonrise, Captain! First night of full."
barbossa,Hah!  Be mindful of pits and crevasses. Stay together.
barbossa,"Careful, mate. Fall down there, you'd die and miss Judgement Day -- for not even the Lord himself'll come look for you here."
cotton's parrot,Land HO! Land HO! LAND ho! LAND ho!
anamaria,How does he do that?
jack,"They'll be anchored on the lee side. Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island -"
elizabeth,The curse drove you to gather this?
will,What's that?
jack,Depends.
will,On what?
jack,"On whether the stories are    all true. If they are, that's    a waterfall that spills over    at high tide, with a short drop to    an underground lagoon. If not    -"
jack,Chalk one up for the stories.
barbossa,"Here we stand before the cursed treasure of Cortez himself. Won by blood, it demands blood in return."
barbossa,You know the first thing I'm going to do after the curse is lifted?  Eat a whole bushel of apples.
koehler,Did it work?
deadeye,I don't feel no different.
jacoby,How do we tell?
koehler,You're not dead.
jacoby,No.  He shot me!
barbossa,You. Maid. Your father. What was his name?!  Was your father William Turner?!
elizabeth,No.
barbossa,"Where's his child? The child that sailed from England eight years ago, the child who is the real owner of that medallion, the child in whose veins flows the blood of William Turner?! Where?"
jacoby, You brought us the wrong person!
pintel,She had the medallion! She's the right age. She said her name was Turner!
twigg, You brought us here for nothing?
elizabeth,You?!
jack,Me!
elizabeth,You're in league with Barbossa!
jack,"No, I'm -- rescuing you."
elizabeth,You?!
will,Miss Swann! We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
jack,This way!
will,I'm glad we got here in time.
elizabeth,Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
jack,"The trick isn't getting here, it's getting away."
elizabeth,Come on!
will,No.
jack,I'll lead them away.
will,Are you sure? Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
jack,"I'm sure. When you've led the kind of life I have, there are debts that must be paid. Maybe I can balance the scales a little."
barbossa,"I'm inclined to kill you now, Jack Sparrow, without so much as a word, if you don't lose that grin from your face."
jack,"The woman's blood didn't work, did it?"
barbossa,"Say the name, or I slit your throat."
jack,No you won't.
pintel,Now?
jack,Simple. I have something you want more than anything. The way to free you from the curse of the treasure. You have something I want -- more than anything.
barbossa,"The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine. And just how do you expect this to work?"
jack,You give me the Pearl. Then I tell you who you need.
barbossa,"That's your offer? You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?"
jack,That's right.
barbossa,I'm supposed to ... trust you?
jack,I'm a man of my word.
barbossa,I'll torture it out of you.
jack,You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
barbossa,Blast you! I'll throw you in prison.
jack,Wait as long as you like.
barbossa,"You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!"
jack,Let's say I tell you the wrong person. What would you do?
barbossa,Track you down and -
jack,"And if I tell you the truth, you become mortal, and you won't come near me because you know I'd kill you."
barbossa,"Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact. Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that."
jack,"See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want."
barbossa,"You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that. "
jack,What -- you don't have the medallion?
barbossa,"That fool woman took it. You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside."
jack,I'll watch my back.
barbossa,"Bosun! Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course."
gibbs,Two women on board? A man don't have to be superstitious to know that's trouble.
elizabeth,"... you were in danger ... so I took the medallion. And I've kept it ever since. They thought I was you, that they needed my blood. And it didn't work."
will,Why would my father send this to me?
elizabeth,"To keep it away from them? No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock."
will,If I had known-
elizabeth, -- then we never would have met.
will,I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
elizabeth,I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
gibbs,"Shift your heading, steer clear of that island. Fifteen degrees starboard."
cotton's parrot,Dead men tell NO tales! Dead men tell NO tales! Dead men tell NO tales!
anamaria,Can we outrun them?
gibbs,Not a chance. Make for the reef.
pintel,What's he doing? Is he going to run her aground?
gibbs,Drop the forward anchor!
barbossa,All hands! Prepare to come about!
jack,"Don't hit my ship! I mean, kill the lying scoundrel -  I'm a little conflicted, here."
barbossa,"Strike your colors, you bloody cockroaches!"
anamaria,Looks like they mean to send us under.
gibbs,"There -- she's raised the Jolly Roger,"
will,We're not going to just surrender!
will,We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few-
gibbs,"Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight."
barbossa,"Welcome back, Miss. Last time on board, you played me right clever, make pretending and all. I hope your stay this time is more pleasant. Boys, show her some hospitality!"
will,She goes free!
barbossa,"What's in your head, boy?"
will,She. Goes. Free.
barbossa,You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
will,You can't. I can.
elizabeth,No!
will,"My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner. His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood. And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!"
twigg,It's true - he's the spittin' image of old Bootstrap. Even talks the same!
barbossa,Looks like you're back to having nothing to offer.
pintel,"And hers got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!"
barbossa,Enough of that!  Name your terms.
will,Elizabeth goes free!
barbossa,We got that part. Anything else?
will,And Jack. And the crew. Free and unharmed. I f you agree... then... I will remain with you.
elizabeth,Will -- you can't trust him.
will,You must swear by the Holy Bible.
barbossa,"Eh? You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul."
gibbs, Amen to that...
barbossa,"Jack, Elizabeth ... I'm a man of my word and you're to be set free, right quick.  Men, break out the plank!"
will,No! You gave your word!
barbossa,"Quiet, boy, or you'll lose your tongue. Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free. I didn't say when. .. nor where."
jack,"It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime. No good can come of it."
barbossa,"Now, Jack. That reef is less than a league distant. It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better."
jack,"Someone needs to cut these bonds, then."
barbossa,"You'd best take a swim, Jack."
jack,"The last time you did this, you left me a pistol, with one shot."
pintel,"That's proper, sir, according to the code."
barbossa,"By the Powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol? Who's got it? Bring it forward!"
jack,"A gentleman might give us two pistols, seeing as there are two of us, this time."
barbossa,"Tell you what. I'll   give you one pistol, and let you   be the gentleman, an' shoot the lady,   and starve to death yourself!  That is, presuming   you're not both drownded."
jack,You can go to your grave not knowing.
barbossa,That's fair.
elizabeth,Here -- it will go well with your black heart !
barbossa,"Have at her, lads!"
elizabeth,You went back for that? We need to head for the reef!
jack,That's the second time I've had to watch that man sail away with my ship.
elizabeth,Has it changed since the last time you were here?
jack,The trees are taller.
elizabeth,I hope you have no intention of using that.
jack,Not yet. Ask me again in a few weeks.
elizabeth,Captain Sparrow! We have to get off this island -- immediately!
elizabeth,What is that? Is there a boat under there?
jack,"It won't. It won't, and so we won't."
elizabeth,But ... you did it before! Last time -
jack,"Last time, I was here a grand total of three days. Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off."
elizabeth,So that's it? That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous
jack,"Welcome to the Caribbean, love."
elizabeth,A month? Will doesn't have a month! We've got to do something to help him!
jack,"You're right.  Here's luck to you, Will Turner."
elizabeth,"Not when you can drink instead, at least."
elizabeth,And you will call me Miss Swann.
jack,"What? What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? share. Please,"
elizabeth,Nothing ... it's nothing. Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child. A song about pirates.
jack,"I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child. Let's hear it."
elizabeth,"Oh, no ... it's silly.   Back in England we didn't know   a thing about pirates, really.   They seemed so romantic and daring   -"
elizabeth,"Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ..."
jack,More to drink!
elizabeth,"We pillage, we plunder, we rifle, we loot, Drink up me hearties, yo ho."
jack,"I LOVE this song!  Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me! We're beggars and blighters,"
elizabeth,You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
jack,"Not just the Spanish Main. The whole ocean. .. the whole world. Wherever we want to go, we go. That's what a ship is, you know. Not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails. That's what a ship need_ ... but what a ship is -- what the Black Pearl really-is ... is freedom."
elizabeth,"Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again."
jack,"Ah, well... the company is better than last time. And the scenery has definitely improved."
jack,We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
elizabeth,To freedom.
jack,To the Black Pearl.
jack,"What are you doing? You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!"
elizabeth,"Yes, the rum is gone."
elizabeth,"One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two -"
jack,"You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?"
elizabeth,Exactly.
norrington,"Elizabeth, I'm"" relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons. And behind his back this time."
elizabetii,"Commodore, you can't do that!"
norrington,You're speaking up for him again?
elizabeth,He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
jack, We had time to get to know each other.
norrington,"We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta."
elizabeth,No. The pirates have taken Will -
norrington,Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home. That is what we shall do. Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable. But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
elizabeth,"Commodore, please!"
norrington,"By remembering that I serve others, not only myself."
elizabeth,"Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me. As a wedding gift."
norrington,I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
elizabeth,Not as a condition -- a request.
norrington,"Free Mister Sparrow, and prepare to come about. He'll give you our heading."
jack,"Congratulations, sir."
norrington,"Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal."
elizabeth,What?
norrington,I know now where your heart truly lies.
elizabeth,"And now I know... where yours does, as well."
norrington,You may seclude yourself in my cabin. I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
elizabeth,Then I can wear men's clothing.
norrington,That would hardly be proper.
elizabeth,"Well, I am not going to stay hidden in a some cabin, 80 I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare ankles for the remainder of the voyage!"
norrington,"Murtogg, take our guest below, and find her some trousers, and a shirt."
pintel,That ain't going to work. That's the gun deck above yea
will,What happened to William Turner?
pintel,"Ah, William Turner. Stupid blighter. He threw in with us after we relieved Jack Sparrow of his captaincy, but turned out, it never sat well with him- particularly after we found Cortes' treasure, and its peculiar condition. He thought we deserved to be cursed, for leaving ol' Jack to the fate we did. That's why he sent off a piece of the treasure -- to you, as it were: so it would never be recovered, and so cursed we_ remain."
will,And then he ran. And he's hiding out someplace where you haven't been able to find him.
pintel,"That's a nice thought, to be sure, and I wager your da wishes he'd thought it hisself. But, no. See, what he'd done, _ didn't sit too well with Captain Barbossa ... so he chained a cannon to his legs and dumped him over."
barbossa,Bring him.
elizabeth,You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
jack,"Nor did you, I noticed."
elizabeth,He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
jack,Exactly.
elizabeth,These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
jack,"I have a plan. If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided."
elizabeth,What's your plan?
norrington,Elizabeth -- below decks. I will not compromise your safety..
jack,"Funny, I was thinking   along those lines. How about you let me   go in alone, and while you're setting   up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out   to you."
norrington,You would do that?
jack,They left me stranded. Twice. What have you got to lose?
norrington, Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
jack, I knew you'd listen to reason!
jack,"That chart I drew up'11 get you past the reefs. If you're steersman's good enough, that is."
norrington,I'll be at the wheel myself.
jack,"I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them."
pintel,No reason to fret. It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
barbossa,"Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe, and spill it all."
pintel,I guess there is a reason to fret.
barbossa,"Careful, now. You could fall in and still be wonder'n when you'll hit dirt."
will,You deserve to be cursed -- and remain cursed!
barbossa,"Blast him! A pox on him, and his father, and the whole damnable line! Fan out! Find him!"
cotton's parrot,Drink UP me hearties yo ho! Drink UP me hearties yo ho!
jack,Do you have any idea where you're going?
will,Jack!
jack,Don't talk. These caves magnify sound. Just follow me.
will,Are you certain this is the right way?
jack,It's the right way.
barbossa,"Thank you, Jack Sparrow."
will,You did know where you were going! You did lead us directly to them!  Why?
barbossa,"What was begun by blood, let blood now end!"
jack,You don't want to be doing that.
barbossa,"No, I really think I do."
jack, All right then.
barbossa,Why don't I want to do this?
jack,"Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor."
will,Jack!
jack,- - and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
pintel,Do you believe him?
barbossa,No.  But him I believe. He is genuinely angry.
jack,"You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal."
barbossa,What're you suggesting?
jack,Simple. Don't kill the boy yet. Wait for a more opportune moment.
barbossa,"I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end 80 well for you."
jack,The situation has changed.
barbossa,That so?
jack,"Aye. See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do? Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue? The Dauntless a first-rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas. "
barbossa,Men! Are you up for it?
jack,There's ... another exit?
barbossa,"Aye, for us there is."
tall sailor,Ship rats. Big ones.
short sailor, Hate those things.
tall sailor,That they do.
pintel,"Be quick, now. Train the starboard guns on the beach, and set your aim. Wait for my signal, we don't want to spook them."
skinny,"Which would you prefer first, good sir -rum, or wine?"
gillette,"All the men in place, sir. Ready to fire."
norrington,Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
will,You've been planning this from the beginning. Since you learned my name.
jack,"Oh, please -- do I really seem that clever?"
barbossa,"Confound it, Jack -- I was actually beginning to like you!"
norrington,"Steady, men! Remember -- we're the Navy!"
gillette,"They're on our side! Take heart, men!"
barbossa,"Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever. I think you're a fool. A mortal fool."
jack,Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
barbossa,"You can't beat me, Jack."
will,Jack!
jack,"Well, isn't that interesting."
barbossa,"So what now, Jack Sparrow? Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgment Day?"
jack,Or you could surrender.
barbossa,"Or I could chain you to a cannonball and drop you in the deepest part of the ocean, where you can contemplate your folly forever."
will,He didn't waste it.
will,"Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can It betray his friends. What kind of pirate is that?"
jack," On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants. Now that's a great pirate."
will,Let's get out of here.
elizabeth,You're all right!
will,Miss Swann -- are you wearing trousers? And how did you get off the island?
elizabeth,"Yes, I am wearing trousers. And as for how we got off the island -- ah, that's a grand adventure, but now is not the time to talk about it."
will,"Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter- that we are of a different class -"
elizabeth,It doesn't!
will,-- but that was not a proper kiss.
jack,Tough luck. I was rooting for you.
norrington,"...and though I do say so with regret, the law is clear. The penalty for piracy is death by hanging."
swann,"By your leave, I wish to speak on behalf of the boy.  So in my capacity as Governor, I   intend to grant a pardon to --"
gillette,Sir!
swann,The Black Pearl!
gillette,Sir! Shall I break out the cannons?
norrington,I don't think that will be necessary.
anamaria,Captain Sparrow -- the Black Pearl is yours!
jack,"AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!"
anamaria,"Aye, aye, sir!"
jack,"Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail - you and Cotton. I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and-span and ship-shape!"
the end,FADE OUT and CREDITS ROLL
