TONY looks inside the Barber shop and sees threatening faces. He enters anyway. Goes up to GUY SELLING SODA who takes the coin out of TONY's hand and gives him a soda. TONY is puzzled.  DISSOLVE:  Tony is siting in a chair with a cloth wrapped up to his neck. The barber looks at TONY'S hair. TONY is trying to open the can but can't figure it out."

brenda,"This case is a mess. We don't know what is going on with the child. No, no, no, no, no no, the couple is stonewalling. Nobody has seen the child, in what, 15 years. Every visit is marked ""guardian unavailable"". Nobody bothers because it's the island. And get this, the couple, they're not married. No. They're the step-children of the owner of the island who is now deceased...  EXTERIOR - CATALINA EXPRESS TERMINAL - EARLY MORNING BRENDA walks into the terminal."
doolittle,The is your meeting so why don't we get down to business.
dave,Sounds fine.
doolittle,Call Boston if you want. I don't think the time change will make any difference
dave,"Your name is Filmore West, correct?  TONY does not answer."
doolittle,We're requesting an environmental impact study on the employment angle in Avalon.
dave,"Are you kidding?  Any loss in jobs will be absorbed in the Federal tourism franchise. Employment will double, property and leases will increase in value. The overall benefit will be stunning to the average citizen of Avalon."
doolittle,"What if we tell everybody about the national resources here. If you'll remember your history gentlemen, the civil war was won by the collateral in the Treasury created by the California gold rush. We think the government needs a big hit of cash right now to cure the deficit. Remember what Churchill said, a great government never has to face the truth nor pay cash."
dave,Could we have a moment?
doolittle,We're looking very good here. Just don't give them anything they can use. Do not say anything.  INTERIOR - ISLAND OFFICE - DAY DAVE and TOSHI stand and walk to the corner of the room.
dave,What if we bring up the legality of him impersonating his grandfather.
toshi,I think we need something stronger. Any sexual harassment suits or child abuse. He's a guardian.
brenda,"Hello, I'm from the department of Human Services in LA.  I'm looking for a missing child who may be somewhere on the island."
sheridan,Name?
brenda,A Marie-Christine West? Her guardian is a Mr. Filmore West.  INTERIOR - INN ON MT. ADA - DAY TONY and DOOLITTLE as they confer.
tony,I think I know what's going on here.
doolittle,"Good, good, good, good, just don't say anything."
brenda,Did they have a child with them? Or did they take this child with them?  The OFFICER interrupts BRENDA.
officer,They're brats. They're very unpopular around here. They're keeping the property values from tripling.
brenda,"Great, where can I find them?"
sheridan,Probably France. What would you do if you owned all of Catalina and Anacapa..?
officer,"...all the way to San Miguel including the Big Island which has gold deposits and the IRS are looking for them?  BRENDA's expression changes. She becomes maniacal.  INTERIOR - INN ON MT. ADA - DAY DAVE and TOSHI sit down again, ready with a response."
dave,I'd like to direct your attention to the signatures on these documents.  DOOLITTLE rips the document out of DAVE'S hand.
doolittle,This is intolerable!
dave,"One is a reconveyence of a second deed of trust, and the other is your recent letter to us. You would have been 4 years old at the time of the first document."
tony,You guys believe in fairy tales don't you?
dave,We want to know who you are.
tony,This reminds me of the Tempest where the rightful Duke is robbed of his kingdom by his evil brother...
toshi,Were you born in this country?
tony,...and the evil brother puts the good Duke and his daughter out to sea in a small boat to die. And at the end of the story....
doolittle,My client is using a figure of speech.
dave,"Then where are we going with this, guys?"
tony,You two are going to jail.
doolittle,We're saying....you don't have enough money.
tony,What do you say next?
toshi,We're just representing the United States Government in an attempt to take what the people have a right to.
tony,"Big Brother. Orwell! No, no, That's too recent."
doolittle,The situation is irreversible.
dave,What are you going to do?  Act it out for us.  TONY heats up.
tony,"...And it's raining and hailing and lightning's striking and you guys think that I'm dead, but I'm not. I'm really back in the big island with my daughter.  DOOLITTLE puts his hand on TONY'S shoulder to restrain him."
tony,"And you know what we're doing. Playing chess, and having a picnic!  TONY stands up to leave and crashes into a waiter who trips and spills dishes on the floor.  MUSIC: BACH Concerto in D minor  EXTERIOR - AVALON HARBOR - DAY Tourist boats come and go.  INTERIOR - AVALON CLOTHING SHIP - DAY BRENDA looks at a map of the Channel Islands.  She sees the Big Island. A woman behind the counter comes up to her."
counter person,Hi.  Can I help you?
brenda,Which way to the Big Island?
ranch hand,You must have slept a long time.
tony,I've been sleeping a lot lately.
ranch hand,Yeah about 2 years.
ranch hand,A woman named Reggie Swan confirmed she'll arrive March 4th. She'll be staying until September.  I got the bunk house all ready for her.  The RANCH HAND goes back for a second box as TONY continues down the dock.
ranch hand,There have been quite a few fly-overs by the park service.  The last 6 months there has been surf on the North point. Anyone who can afford a boat has been streaming up here like freeway commuters.
tony,Yeah.
ranch hand,"This thing with the surfers has become some sort of a cult. There have been a few entries on the South shore, young men looking for Marie-Noel...I vacated them immediately."
tony,Uh huh.
ranch hand,"The park service has been on the island almost full time, as expected, and the monk from the monastery arrived for another year."
brenda's pov,The lethal arrowhead is pointed at MARIE-NOEL'S head.
tony,More in the boat.
tony,Likewise.
tony,A dry hole.
tony,"I scattered them for their own protection. And it doesn't bother me because any animal, no matter where it starts, turns out the same.  TONY eats pop tarts."
tony,The ones you were wearing the night .....
tony,Is there anything about Halloween in Edgar Allen Poe?  MARIE-NOEL sits up and stops the conversation.  MUSIC Starts: Heavy Rock  FLASH BACK: Halloween Concert. VIEW on audience Dancing..The show on stage..Image of death..View on Sheep in fog.  MUSIC Stops
tony,I guess it's about time. It was starting to bug me.
tony,You can stop living out of suitcases and fix the place up?
tony,What's that supposed to mean?
tony,"I'm in the same situation you are. Moving or sitting still is the same thing, they're everywhere."
tony,I think we can stall the government until the next gubernatorial election.
tony,If anything happens to me you should take the train East...  TONY points East.
tony,"...We both came from the West. I think we'll be heading that way.  MARIE-NOEL Well, you'll be all set up in LA if anything happens to me.  He pauses and doesn't answer right away."
tony,"We've had a good life. We've been lucky. All these extra years are for stories. There's nothing left to do except to see how we fit into them.  MARIE-NOEL becomes silent and distracted, digging in a drawer."
tony,I thought we were going to drop that.
tony,How should I know?
tony,You'll know what to do when the time comes.
tony,Good.
woman,"What are you doing in my apartment? What are you doing here?  ALLEN wakes up, startled, rubbing his eyes."
woman,And who's pizza is this? Excuse me!
allen,"Calm down. We weren't expecting you for a while, we had the exterminator come in like you requested..."
woman,Oh you did?
woman,And who the hell is this?  ALLEN  Take this stuff out for her.  H. TOM starts frantically collecting the garbage.
woman,You've got pizza in my place...you're lying here. Who's clothes are these?  ALLEN picks up his bag of things. H. TOM finishes his cleanup.
allen,There's no pizza here; there's no clothes here.
woman,"You had no permission to come into my place. A guy sleeping in my bedroom, sleeping on my couch."
allen,I'm going to request to the board that you perhaps should be kicked out for your bad sculpture.
woman,"Oh you are?  Get the hell out of here. What kind of manager are you anyway?  The WOMAN slams the door and shakes her head in amazement.

allen,Not me. I keep my nut real low. Basically I live off my relatives. You know?  Free rent. All the chicks I can pluck from my aunt's building. All I need is one national commercial a year and I can live like a king.

aunt debbie,"I hate it because it makes my skin dry, especially my private parts."
julienne,"In Maine, it's been frozen for two months."
aunt debbie,Why are you here anyway?
julienne,To take care of you. I thought that giving it all up and taking care of my old mother would be the simplest life possible. What you're telling me about my cousin Allen is upsetting.
aunt debbie,"My dear husband, bless his soul THE BASTARD. He was very good to me.."
julienne,You always said that.....
aunt debbie,"It was my idea, not his! Now you're cousin Allen is the bastard."
julienne,"Look mom, I came out here because I needed to. I've went through a time with so many regrets. I got ostentatious and solemn and I hated myself, and anyone who behaved the same way.  Independence works better alone. I'm a girl Shane, you know the gunfighter who hung up his guns."
aunt debbie,"You didn't give them enough sex, that's your own fault."
julienne,"Too many people in my past have been hurt, and all of them named Tony."
aunt debbie,Have you seen all these mushrooms around the house?

allen,It wasn't very nice.
barry,What haven't I done for you lately

allen,You know I've added up all the time my commercials have run on television and I'm already way done with my 15 minutes of fame.
barry,Should I take that personally?
allen,Take it how ever you'd like.
barry,You know what? I'm going to take the steps. I don't feel comfortable in this elevator.
allen,Is this about me?

homeless woman,After the earthquake was all over we went down to    the lobby and sad down in the lobby of the building...
homeless woman,"...until the sun came up. And then we went off to our room to see if there was any damage, it was pretty bad. It was quiet, there wasn't anybody driving, there were people just wandering around, you know we walked out and we looked and we saw the cracks..... and you know down the street over here beside the building was off, a big bell tower up the street was tilted halfway down, it was sort of scary......"
homeless woman,"...and you know down the street over here beside the building was off, a big bell tower up the street was tilted halfway down, it was sort of scary......"

tony,"I'm thinking about starting over in LA. I like it     there, I've met some people I like. I'm happy for     the the first time in years."
jim,I knew you would be in spite of all the damage.
tony,How much?
