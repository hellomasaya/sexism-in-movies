grange,"You gonna smoke his bones now, or however it is you do it?"
eric,"""My kitten walks on velvet feet, and makes no sound at all.  And in the doorway nightly sits to watch the darkness fall.  I think he loves the lady night...""  Am I alive?  Am I dead?  Something else?  Something in between?"
eric,Thanks for sharing that.

eric,"""Draven, Eric."""
bouncer,Hey!  You got any ID?
elly,"Very funny.  Ha.  Ha.  Oh my, sides."

darla,I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
elly, I lost my key.
darla, Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
eric,No!  Don't look!  No! No!
eric, Stop it.
skank,"Fuck you, T-Bird."
funboy,"Hey, pussycat."
funboy,More fun than a torture chamber.
eric,We have company.
skull cowboy,Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
eric,Shelly?
skull cowboy,Miss her?
eric,Yes.
skull cowboy,"Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion."
eric,Goddammit.
skull cowboy,Get it?
eric,Leave me alone -- !
skull cowboy, Do something about it. ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND THE SKULL COWBOY.
eric,I guess I'm not ready to leave... just yet.
ratso,"Please, TIn-Tin, you know I'm good for the money, man, I promise, Leslie put me up to it, please, man, don't -- "
eric,"Hello, Tin-Tin."
eric,Murderer.
eric,Try harder.  Try again.
eric,A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
eric,You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
eric,"I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin."
eric,Victims.  Aren't we all.
eric,Halloween is coming.  The Day of the Dead...
shelly,Your scary quotient needs work.
shelly,"I think red's my color, don't you?"
skull cowboy,Glad to see you're finally with the program.
eric,"Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy."
skull cowboy,"You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all."
eric,Forget this.
eric,She always red red was her color.
eric,"All right, bad guys..."
eric, Here I commme -- !
torres,Couldn't have happened to a nicer couple.
albrecht,"Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones."
torres,"You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?"
albrecht,This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
torres,"Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?"
albrecht,He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
torres,Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
torres,And you're gonna tell me who.
albrecht,Who ever made that.
torres,What in the hell... do you call that?
albrecht,"I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti."
gideon,"Piss off, we're closed."
gideon,Fucking creatures of the night; they never goddamn learn.
eric,"""Suddenly I heard a tapping, as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.""  You heard me rapping, right?"
gideon,"Oh, bullshit!  You're trespassing asshole, you're breakin' and enterin' and you just bought me a fucking door!"
eric,I'm looking for something in an engagement ring.  Gold.
gideon,"You're looking for a coroner,shit- for-brains!"
eric,"I repeat: a gold engagement ring. It was pawned here, a year ago, by another gentleman whose name, I believe was... ""T-Bird""?"
gideon, I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
eric,Wrong answer.
gideon,All's I got is in a box!  Behind the counter!
eric,No... no... no... no...
eric,"Tin-Tin confided in me, before he ran out of breath.  You have one chance to live. GIDEON No fucking way.  He'll kill me."
eric,Who would waste time killing you... besides me?
gideon, Top Dollar.
eric,Another jolly nickname?
gideon,"You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar."
eric,T-Bird?
gideon,"Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar."
eric,"A whole club of pirates, with pirate names..."
eric,You feed off the living.
gideon,"You walk outta here Top Dollar will erase your ass!  Top Dollar owns the fucking street here and you can't dick with me, you son of a bitch!"
eric,One chance to live.  Take it.
eric,"I thought the police always said ""freeze:."
albrecht,"I'm the police and I say don't move, Snow White.  You're under arrest; I don't care what else is wrong with you!  You move and you're dead."
eric,And I say I'm dead... and I move.
albrecht,No further.  I'm serious.
eric,"Then shoot, if you will."
albrecht,"Are you nuts, walking into a gun?"
eric,"You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance."
albrecht,You wanna run that back for me one time?
eric,"Listen:  Top Dollar.  He ""owns the street here.""  He will ""erase my ass."""
albrecht,You don't say.
eric,I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
albrecht,"Fucking A, my friend."
eric,"The others are called Skank, T- Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.  Watch me, office Albrecht."
albrecht,Watch it...
albrecht,You're the one who did Tin-Tin...
dickey bird,T-Bird.  Thrill me.
top dollar,Wild fucking night.  I hear our pal Tin-Tin got himself very dead.
top dollar,"Bet that pisses you off, right?"
top dollar,"Stay normal, T.  Cops'll be all hotwired and aggressive.  No combat moves until I check this out."
elly,What are you supposed to be?  A clown?
eric,Sometimes.
elly,You look like a rock star without a job.
eric,I dabble.  May I?
elly,If you're not some kinda child molester.
top dollar,I thought Halloween was tomorrow night.
top dollar,"Get outta my way, you mooks."
lao,An unexpected pleasure.
top dollar,"Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked."
lao,Who got himself what?
top dollar,One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
lao,"I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The ""hit""."
top dollar,I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
lao,"I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?"
top dollar,Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
lao,To be sure.  Now tell how your friend died.
annabella,"Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight."
albrecht,"Annie, I need a file."
annabella,Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
albrecht,"This is special, darlin'.  Please?"
annabella,"Just don't tell me you ""owe me one.""  What file?"
albrecht,Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
elly,"My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now."
eric,Who?
elly,Mister Funboy.
eric,Mister Funboy lives there?
elly,"He has a room, upstairs.  I don't like him very much."
eric,I can pick out a tune now and again.
elly,"Can you play ""Teddy Bears' Picnic?""  It used to be her favorite."
eric,Does she have a name?
elly,No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
eric,No.
elly,"You gotta go now, I bet."
eric,I have to go.
grange,Top Dollar?
bounce,Never heard of him.
grange,Funboy?
bouncer,"Oh, prob'ly upstairs bangin' Darla.  Pay for your own beer and they'll prob'ly be down before you can drink it."
annabella,Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
albrecht,I knew that.
albrecht,Another nice white girl with a cause.  Like a big KICK ME sign.
annabella,"Your last little wild goose chase got you busted back to the Beat Patrol, just like in a bad detective story, Eddie. Are we doing the wildgoose thing again?"
albrecht,Could be.
annabella,"You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know."
albrecht,"Well, hello there...chocolate,"
annabella,Don't thank me.
albrecht,"Thanks, babe."
eric,"It's a Raymond Chandler evening And the pavements are all wet, And I'm lurking in the shadows, for it hasn't happened ..."
darla,"Ooh, baby -- gimme all of it."
darla,It's a big fucking bird...
funboy,"It's a squab.  Here bird, Here, birdie..."
eric,Here Funboy.
funboy,"Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack."
darla,Fun -- look at that guy...
funboy,"It's just the dope, don't worry"
darla,"Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!"
funboy,Not me.
funboy,"You are seriously fucked up, man. Just look at yourself."
eric,Bull's eye.  Good shot.
eric,Stay.
eric,Morphine is bad for you.
funboy,How the hell did you do that?
eric,Magic.
funboy,Either die or do a solo.
eric,Neither.
funboy,"Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself."
funboy,I hate trespassers!  And right now I hate you!
funboy,"Ahh, the hell with it, I still got five shots left."
funboy,"Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!"
eric,Does it hurt?
funboy,"Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  What the shit are you gonna do about this?!"
eric,I have some pain killer right here.
funboy,"No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !"
eric,Your pain ends now.
skull cowboy,Howdy  You look a mess.  Like an ole cooter dog.
skull cowboy,"Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?"
eric,Go away.
skull cowboy,You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
eric,Shut up.
skull cowboy,Maybe I was wrong about you.
eric,"Your daughter is out there, on the street, waiting for you."
eric,Go.  Now.
bouncer,"Hey, g'night, Darla.  That there is Darla."
grange,Funboy?
eric,Freeze.
albrecht,"Jeezus!  Don't ever do that, man!"
eric,"I saw it, too."
albrecht,"You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --"
eric,I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
albrecht,You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.
albrecht,"You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened."
eric,The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
albrecht,"You gotta understand -- I was hoping she'd talk, give me a lead, a clue, something to work with. But she only said one thing to me before she died."
eric,My name.
albrecht," I'm sorry as hell, man."
eric,"Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change..."
eric,"Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night."
albrecht,I should be trying to stop you.
eric,Thank you.  For giving a damn.
albrecht,My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
albrecht,"Damn, I wish he wouldn't do that."
grange,The son of a bitch winked at me. The he jumped.  Three stories.
lao,Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
grange, There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
lao,Good.
skank,"I wish to hell I had torched Gideon's, that fat fuck."
skank,Got it.
eric,I'm your passenger.  You drive. And stop talking.
skank,What's all this happy horseshit?
axel,"Alright, alright, alright -- everybody be cool and stay exactly where you are."
chopper,"Whooooa, cowboy!  Cool gun."
eric,That's good.  We're going someplace you've never been before.
mj,Smells like rain.
speeg,Smells like a septic tank.  You got that cream stuff?
mj,In the bag.
mj,What in the crap?
speeg,"Ow! Owowoowowoowo, goddammit!"
eric,You caught one.  Drive faster.
eric,I want you to stop talking.  And drive.  Drive faster.
eric, Naturally.
eric,"Time for your reward, T.  Payback with interest earned."
eric,"A little restrictive?  Good.  What's the lag on this?  About twenty seconds, would you say?"
eric,All gone.
darla,I never was too good at this domestic shit.
elly,"Don't say ""shit"".  That's okay.  Corn Flakes are okay.  Anything."
mickey,Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
elly,Mom tried to cook.
mickey,Oh.
mickey, Everyone's a comedian.  Enjoy.
elly,"A lot of people ""know"" my mom."
grange,"I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star."
elly,I don't know you.
grange, I'd like to get in touch with him.
elly,"You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?"
grange,I'm looking for a good guitar man.
elly,Right.
grange,"I need to find him kind of soon, Elly."
eric,That's better.
skank,"Top, I made the sumbitch!  Face all painted white like some kinda fuckin' kabuki homo!"
lao,"Sounds like our ""Crow"" is out-maneuvering you."
top dollar,"""Our"" Crow...?"
lao,"Come now.  You've seen the graffiti -- all over the city in the few hors it has taken your men to drop like plague victims. What about your turf, Top?  You don't seem to have ripped out anyone's heart yet."
top dollar, The night is young.
skank, The found T-bird flash-fried to what was left of his fucking car!
top dollar,"Hey, you little fuckweed!  That's against the law!"
lao,I am sitting over here.
top dollar,Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
lao,"Your comprehension is not required.  Your cooperation and, indeed, your ability are the issues on the table."
top dollar,"Whatever you say, I can do."
lao,That's reassuring.
skank,What was that -- !?
top dollar,"Too many poppers, Skank.  Relax.  Heel."
top dollar," You want my attention, man you got it."
skank,"It's him, Top!  He dusted T-Bird!"
eric,You have to be SKank.  One moment.
eric,Thank of a snappy comeback for me on your way down.
mj,OwwwAAHHH son of a BITCH!
eric,"Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air..."
top dollar,"Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you."
eric,Do you know what you destroyed?
top dollar,"Take the dope, too."
eric,A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
top dollar,That's ancient history.
eric,It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed?
top dollar,"Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!"
eric,You don't even remember...
top dollar,"I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story."
eric,Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
eric,"You're a detail man, Top -- you need to see more."
eric,"All of her pain, Top.  Thirty hours.  All at once..."
eric,I didn't think you could handle it either.
lead swat,"That's all she wrote, Bozo!  You stand down now, and that's an order!"
lead swat,The fire escape's covered.
lead swat,"Holy shit, it's spiderman."
lead swat,Dammit to hell!  Come on.
albrecht, Come on!
albrecht,Keep your head down!
eric,It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
eric,Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
albrecht,"Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit."
eric,It's only a flesh wound.
albrecht,It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
eric,You shouldn't smoke these.
albrecht,Great.  Litterbug of the Living Dead.
eric,I'm finished.
albrecht, You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
albrecht,You're gonna kill somebody else.  We're gonna stop and get a shit-load of Band-Aids?
eric,I have to prepare for an anniversary.  This coming night.
grange,What... the hell is that?
lao," This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real."
grange,That thing is poisonous.
lao,"Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow."
grange,Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
lao,"I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury."
grange,"Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet."
lao,"Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course."
grange,Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
lao,Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
grange,Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
grange,Kill a dead guy?
lao,Truly kill him.  So I may crush his skull and smoke it.
elly,What's going on...?
eric,A remembrance.  A closure.
eric,"Better now.  I feel good.  How are you, Elly, my friend?"
eric,"What is it? ELLY I knew.  I knew I knew you.  Even with the makeup and stuff you wore.  You really loved her, didn't you?"
eric,"You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives."
elly," She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair."
eric,Elly...
elly,You look funny without your white face on.  Like it's your day off or something.
eric,Somebody here wants to meet you. Gabriel?
elly,"I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?"
eric,"I think he's yours, now."
elly,Nobody ever gave me something like that before.  Ever.
eric,"Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it..."
elly,And she'll be alive.  Up here.
elly,You're gonna like it here.
darla,"I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?"
elly,"He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said."
darla,We'll discuss this later. Obviously.  You left the door open.
grange,"Hi, Elly.  Remember me?"
darla,I don't remember you.  And I don't remember inviting...
grange," If she opens her face again, shoot her in the head."
elly, Mom -- !
grange,You should listen to your mother. She said no cats.
elly,Gabriel!
grange,Now that's the expression I want.
creature kid,Trick or treat!
skull cowboy,Stop screwing around.
eric,Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die.  I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included.
skull cowboy,Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
eric,Fine with me.
skull cowboy,You'll be alone.
eric,I'm already alone.
grange,We've got company.
grange,He's just out front talking to himself.  You tell me.
eric,Don't waste my time.
skull cowboy,"Very well, it's your ass."
eric,But why are you still here?
eric,I can see her.
lao,"Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light."
grange," Move in, guys."
lao,I wish to possess what you have now.
eric,I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
lao,I know.  That is why I will prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?
lao,"Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them."
eric,You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
lao,I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.
albrecht,"Had to go get yourself hip-deep in shit, didn't you, my friend."
lao,I said no shooting!
albrecht,You sorta looked like you might need my help.
eric,This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
albrecht,You're welcome.
eric,Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
albrecht,The hell you say.  This isn't just about you any more.
eric,Don't interfere.
albrecht,"You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it."
albrecht,"You won't mind if I just take the stairs, then, smartass..."
eric,Here I am.
lao,"Can you fly, Crow man?"
albrecht,I ain't cut out for this superhero shit.
lao,Face me!
albrecht,Is he dead yet?
lao,No.  You are.
elly,"You go to hell, you pervert!"
eric,And how many lives have you destroyed?
lao,"I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine."
eric," You're right, I'm not an avenger. Not any more."
eric,Time for a sacrifice.
lao,I don't need eyes to take what I want from you.
eric,Can you fly?
elly,Don't let me fall!
elly,"Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean."
eric,In a better place.  I hope.
elly,"You're not gonna come back, are you?"
eric,I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
elly,"You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww."
eric,"For you, I'll try.  Promise."
eric,Leave me now.
darla,"Worktime, kiddo.  First day, new job, gotta go."
darla,At least it finally stopped raining.
elly,It can't rain all the time.
