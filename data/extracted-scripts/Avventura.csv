Speaker,Dialogue
anna,"So, there you are... I've been upstairs looking all over for you..."
anna,"No, not yet, Dad."
old man,And who do you think made that hole over there?
raimondo, Lady Patrizia!
sandro,I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
giulia, Where is she going?  SANDRO Ask her.
patrizia,... and how ugly they are ... with all those teeth...  CORRADO  There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!  CORRADO Who's moving?
claudia, This one is gorgeous.
patrizia," Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...  RAIMONDO If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue..."
raimondo," And just think -- if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations, degradations, infidelities... of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well, anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of laziness... of unwillingness."
giulia," He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more."
sandro, And why haven't they left each other?  CLAUDIA I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?  SANDRO Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
giulia," The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all."
sandro," Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?"
sandro," This is the kind of behavior that drives me crazy!  Down at the shore, Giulia is getting ready to step on the gangplank and go aboard the yacht but, anxious about Anna's whereabouts, she changes her mind and turns back. Claudia, also deeply concerned, decides to remain and look around for herself. She turns and starts climbing up towards the rock in an opposite direction than that taken by Sandro, who has now reached the top."
claudia, What do you mean! What about Anna?
corrado, There are some footprints around here...
raimondo, Mario...Steer the boat that way.
patrizia, How long will it take to go there and come back?
giulia," But why?... What if it starts to rain?  CORRADO If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella."
giulia, Do you want some blankets? ... and something to eat?
corrado," What were you and Anna arguing about?... Excuse me for being so indiscreet, but this is serious..."
old man, What boat?
marshal, Anything new develop?
marshal,"Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here."
marshal,"Don't worry, we've got everything."
marshal," I know, I know. One thing at a time."
carabiniere, Nothing here!
corrado,"Don't look at me like that, Marshal...  I had nothing to do with it.  PATRIZIA  Let's hope they don't find her... If they do, they would find her dead."
claudia, I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
patrizia," What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm."
claudia, Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
raimondo, What is it?
frogman,An ancient vase. There's a buried city under here. It's full of this stuff.
patrizia," Come on, Corrado, tell us what century it belongs to."
patrizia, But aren't you supposed to be on your way?
carabiniere,It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
elderly gentleman,And sometimes even twenty-four... depending on the wind...
carabiniere,"If the girl disappeared yesterday afternoon, we'll have to wait at least until three or four o'clock."
voices,It belongs to me... We found it...
gentleman,Back... Stand back!
carabiniere, You see? It contains cigarettes. We'll have to confiscate it.
carabiniere, These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
carabiniere,"It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened."
carabiniere,"But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there."
carabiniere, As you wish.
marshal, ... Is it also true that you saw no boat around here at Lisca between yesterday and this morning?
old man,"How many times do I have to tell you, Marshal, that I was at Panarea."
marshal,"I believe you, I believe you... But I'm also certain that you're hiding something from me. I can see it written all over your face... And you know that I have never liked your face. And if you want to know something, that gentleman over there...  ...who's a very important person... doesn't like it either. So, just keep that in mind. I'll talk to you later."
marshal,"Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island..."
marshal,"I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I..."
marshal,"Here's her valise, sir."
marshal,"Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?"
attendant, Get everybody out of the way...
marshal,Okay. I'll send them down to that part of the beach over there...
marshal,We'll try again.
carabiniere," We didn't check the other islands, so..."
carabiniere, He wanted to come back.
marshal,Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
marshal, I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
marshal,But for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
marshal,I think it's possible.
marshal,What is it about?  SAILOR They've stopped a suspicious-looking boat a few miles from here... yesterday afternoon. The crew has been taken to Milazzo for questioning.
lieutenant,"Okay. Just sign here.  Have the next one come in. He's the last, isn't he?"
lieutenant,They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
lieutenant,"So that's why you've turned to smuggling, eh? You need the money. Now, I can help you. I can see that you get some assistance from the government. But first there's a little formality we've got to take care of. Just a few questions and then we can all go to lunch... Your friend tells me you dropped anchor three times..."
lieutenant," Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?"
lieutenant,"Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?"
lieutenant,"Now look here, I'm ready to forget the whole thing: the cigarettes, the contraband -- everything. If you would only tell me... you or your friends... whether the girl was aboard your boat and how far she went."
lieutenant," Just as I thought. Even if you caught them in the act, they'd deny it. They always deny everything. And then, in this case, if they were to admit having had the girl aboard, it would mean they'd be admitting to the charge of carrying contraband. Oh, it's easy to say: talk! But if they did talk, the following morning you'd find them cold dead in front of their doorstep.  ANNA'S FATHER I think it would be worth my while to take a run over to Palermo. The Chief of Police there is a very good friend of mine and I'm sure he'll do whatever he can. I feel we're wasting our time here... Excuse me, Lieutenant. I hope we see each other again under better circumstances. And thanks for everything."
lieutenant,"At any rate, we'll continue investigating. I know that headquarters has sent out an alarm to all areas..."
sandro," Tell me, Lieutenant, do you happen to know this F.Z. who wrote this article here?"
lieutenant,That's Francesco Zuria. He's the news correspondent.  SANDRO Where can we locate him? Don't you think that by offering a reward to anyone who can give us some information...
lieutenant,Zuria is in Messina. You might try him. Shall we phone him?
sergeant,"Have you any instructions for me, Lieutenant? May I return to Lipari?"
lieutenant,Yes. With whom did you leave the crate of cigarettes?
sergeant,I left it at the warehouse.
sergeant,About two hours ago.
sergeant,I don't know... She said she had to catch a train.
princess,"Oh, how nice! So, you're from Rome... And would you happen to know of some intelligent clergyman in Rome who might be willing to come here and stay with us? We have our own private little chapel... It is a masterpiece, with seventeenth-century frescoes... and the remains of all our dead ancestors, a wonderful collection... He would find it very convenient there, and could say his own masses. Then he would have to spend a little time with my husband, who never sees anyone, to keep him occupied."
ettore, And who is this?
ettore," Sandro?... Oh, sure... I can see Sandro calling Anna over to him and saying: Listen, Anna, I intend to get rid of you, but since it's so painful and complicated... and besides, I don't happen to have a gun on me... why don't you do me a favor and get rid of yourself on your own..."
giulia," Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.  GOFFREDO Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same."
other voices,"It's Queen Saroya... I saw her... So, who could it be?"
sandro, Which one of you is Zuria?
newspaperman,He's inside.
manager,"I phoned you, Chief, because, in view of the situation... I thought it best..."
girl,"I came down here to buy a foulard... Suddenly I realized that little by little, directly behind me, I was being followed by so many men, and more and more of them kept coming."
girl,"But I have always gone around like this, everywhere in the world. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before."
zuria, How old are you?
girl,"Nineteen. My name is Gloria Perkins. I'm married and a writer by profession. I write in a trance, almost always in contact with people who are dead. Tolstoi, for example, or Shakespeare. But the movies also interest me."
girl,"No, why should I be shocked? We're in Italy, not Finland."
girl,In Palermo I was with my husband. Now I'm going to Capri to write an article for the Tourist Office.
girl,"Oh, yes, thank you..."
claudia, It's divine!  PATRIZIA You say that just to flatter me.  CLAUDIA Do you consider that a compliment?  PATRIZIA No.
claudia, Giulia!
sandro, But it even says what she bought: a bar of soap! So there's no point in making believe you can't remember.
lady amalia,Disappeared? Who is she? ... Where? When?  HUSBAND And that makes four. Anybody else?...
wife, Yes!
husband, Brunette.
wife, Blonde.
wife," He doesn't look at dresses, he looks at what's under them."
husband, Then why don't you go back?
driver,Did your car break down?  SANDRO No. I only want some information.
driver,She was a little nervous... dark-haired ... with a kerchief around her head?
assistant,"Two days ago... wasn't there that midwife on the bus, too? Sure, that's right, and she was talking to some young woman ..."
assistant,All I can tell you is that the midwife is from X...
claudia, It's late... We should be going.
man,"Excuse me, but would you mind pulling that cord for me?"
man,Thank you.
coachman, Nobody there.
coachman,Tourists? Last year a few Frenchmen came here and they all walked around in their bathing suits. So they were made to understand that it was better if they didn't come at all.
custodian,"Yes, come right in."
hotel manager,"Go ahead, keep right on singing..."
hotel manager," Excuse me for interfering, but I've heard about that girl... Here in this place one gets to know about everything... That girl you're looking for... Why don't you try asking at the youth hostel in Pergusa? Almost all the young girls traveling through here end up there."
