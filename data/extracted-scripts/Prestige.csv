Speaker,Dialogue
stagehand,Where'd you think you're going?!
bearded man,"I'm part of the act, you fool!"
cutter,Who was that?
cutter,"Because of course, you're not really looking..."
prosecutor,"And did Robert Angier, the Great Danton, your employer, get to that final part of his trick that night? "
cutter,"No, sir. Something went wrong."
prosecutor,What went wrong?
cutter,I saw a someone head below the stage... I followed... and I found  BORDEN-
prosecutor,"Would you describe your occupation to the jury please, Mr.Cutter?"
cutter,I'm an ingeneur. I design illusions and construct the apparatus necessary for perfoming them.
prosecutor,"And for how long had you been Mr.Angier's ""ingeneur""?"
cutter,Eight years. I was privvy to the secrets of his entire act.
prosecutor,"So, Mr.Cutter, was this water-filled tank beneath the stage part of Mr.Angier's illusion- the illusion billed as ""THE REAL TRANSPORTED MAN""?"
cutter,"No, sir. The tank had been used for the first trick, then taken offstage. Borden must have put it under the trap door after the interval."
defender,How large was this tank?
cutter,The sort of tank used for underwater escapes- four or five hundred gallons. 
defender,How do you think Mr.Borden was able to move the tank under the trap door without anyone noticing?
cutter,Ask him- he's the magician.
defender,  I ask again that this man explain the mechanics of Mr.Angier's illusion.
cutter,"  If I reveal my magician's secrets here in open court, I'll be unemployable and the secrets will be worthless. The Real Transported Man is the most sought-after illusion in the business and I have te right to sell it on."
judge,"Mr.Cutter, I see your predicament but we are talking about a capital offence- Alfred Borden's life hangs in the balance."
captain,I'm going to have to ask you to turn out your pockets.
owens,My name is Owens- I'm a solicitor.
borden,How much?
owens,Lord Caldlow is interested in- 
owens,Five thousand pounds.
borden,"Talk to Fallon, my ingenuer- the money's for him."
owens,I did. He offered to sell all of your tricks... except the most valuable one - The Transported Man.
borden,I'd never forgive myself for selling my greatest trick. Borden signals the Wardens to come and unlock him.
owens,"Even for your daughter? Borden looks up. Owens moves closer, quietly assertive."
borden,Fallon can take care of-
owens,"Bernard Fallon? A man with a past even more obscure than your own? The court have already motioned to have the girl removed from his ""care"". No, the girl is to be an orphan. I've been to the work house... Owens looks around the prison yard. Shrugs."
borden,Angier never learned my trick.
owens,"Really? When he returned from Colorado he mounted a version of the Transported Man that the papers said was better, even..."
borden,  If you want Angier's secret you can dig him up and ask him for yourself.
owens,"I want your secret, Mr.Borden...   Consider your daughter!"
angier,  The whole town has electricity?
angier,Quit a reception.
manager,"You're our first guest of the season, Mr.Angier.  Your telegram didn't indicate how long you would be staying with us. "
angier,As long as it takes.   I'll need a coach tomorrow to take me up the mountain.
manager,"The peak is closed, sit. For scientific experimentation."
angier,  That's why I'm here.
driver,"You have to walk the reat, I'm afraid, sir."
shotgun,I'm amazed at how many of you newspaper writers can't read mu sign.
angier,Not the welcome I was expecting.
shotgun,I know you. You're that magician-the Great Danton.  I'm Alley. I saw your show. IN London. Seven times- you guessed every object the audience had in their pockets. Angier leans on his cane and gently brushes off the dirt.
alley,I'm sorry about the fence. People keep interfering with our work.
angier,I've come to see Tesla.
alley,Why?
angier,He built a machine for a- for a colleague of mine. A long time ago. Can you get me a meeting with him?  I've come a very long way.
alley,"Impossible, I'm afraid."
angier,I've brought a lot of money. Beat.
alley,"I'm sorry, Mr.Angier. I simply can't help you. Alley pulls the fence closed."
angier,I'll be staying at the hotel. Indefinitely. Alley watches Angier walk away. He pulls something from his pocket.
alley,What am I holding? Angier doesn't look back.
angier,Your watch.
milton,Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman...
borden,Milton's squadering their goodwill or a bunch of tired second-hand tricks-
angier,"  Old favourites, please."
borden,What about something fresh? He won't even try a bullet catch-
borden,   USE PLANTS-
angier,He can't use plants for every trick.
julia,There'd be no seats left for the punters.
borden,"Fine- no bullet catch. But a real magician tries to invent something new, something other magicians scratch their heads over-"
cutter,They sells it to them for a small fortune.
angier,"Actually, I do."
cutter,Care to sell it?
borden,No one else could do my trick.
angier,I could.
borden,You don't even know what it is.
angier,"Show it to me twice, I'll do it."
cutter,"I admire your spirit, Mr.Angier. But if Borden here really has invented his masterpiece it might well be something only he can do. "
angier,Why?
cutter,"It might be something only he is prepared to do.  my illusions employer, Mr.Milton, is a skilled showman. But Borden's right- he won't get his hands dirty. You want to see what it takes to make real magic- go to the Tenley. There's a Chinaman there who's got what it takes."
angier,Chung Ling Soo.
borden,Tickets are pricey.
cutter,I know a lad on the door. You two watch his show- whoever tells me how he does his goldfish bowl trick gets the prize.
angier,Which is?
cutter,"Ten minutes onstage in front of my old friend, Mr.Ackerman."
julia,Who's Ackerman?
borden,The most powerful theatrical agent in London.
cutter,"I saw you drop the knot again, Borden."
julia,I think I had my wrist turned- 
cutter,"  Some nights you just can't get it, can you? If that knot slips when Julia's on the hoist she'll break a leg."
borden,  It's the wrong knot. A Langford double would hold tighter.
cutter,The Langford double's not a wet knot it's too dangerous. The ropes could swell and she'd never slip it-
julia,I can slip a Lanford underwater.
borden,We've been practiced it-
angier,  He said no.
cutter,  No more mistakes.
angier,Where's he from?
cutter,Where are you from?
angier,He works for another magician? Aren't you worried he'll steal your tricks?
cutter,  He doesn't deal in methods.
angier,How do you know? 
angier,I don't know if I trust him.
cutter,He's a natural magician. Of course you can't trust him.
julia,I think he's alright. Angier turns to Julia. Smiles.
angier,You think everyone's alright.
julia,Even you. Julia kisses Angier. Cutter rises.
cutter,"And Mr.Angier...?  Learn your aight lines- if I can see you sneaking a peck on your wife's ankle from the wings, the blokes on each end of rows 3 and 4 can, too."
borden,Look- he's all right. He's fine. 
borden,"Sharp lad, your son."
borden,"You're the lucky one tonight. Borden walks to a wall of DOZENS of bird cages -- each one with an identical canary. He puts the bird into its cage and returns to the cart props. He taps on the top of the TABLE- a panel POPS open, revealing the FLATTENDED BIRD CAGE. Borden insefts a ROD into the bird cage and PRIES it apart. A TRICKLE of BLOOD emerges, dripping into a bucket below. Borden SLAPS the cage. And the FLATTENED CARCASS of the ORIGINAL BIRD slides out and SPLASHES into the bucket."
borden, Are you watching closely? Borden reaches to the Boy's ear. Casually produces a coin. The Boy marvels as he takes the coin then looks at Borden.
boy,"It's got two heads. Sarah smiles. Borden crouches to address the Boy, grave."
borden,Never. Show. Anyone. 
sarah,He lives with Mum.
borden,And you?
borden,Enough to keep me out?
sarah,I think so. Wil I see you again?
angier,You're wrong. It can't be.
borden,It is. He carries the bowl between his knees for the entire performance.
angier,but look at the man!
borden,  This is the trick. This is why no one detectes his method.
angier,I can barely lift this thing and it's not even filled with water. Or fish. He must be strong as an ox.
julia,  He's been preteding to be an cripple for years?
angier,Any time he's in public. Any time he goes out. It's unthinkable.
julia,You're pretending to be someone else.
angier,I don't think changing your name compares.
julia,"Not just your name- who you are, where you're from..."
angier,I promised my family I wouldn't embarrass them with my theatrical endeavors. Angier cuddles up to Julia.
julia,"I came up with a name for you... ""The Great Danton""   You don't like it? It's sophisticated."
angier,It's French.
sarah,Alfred?!
borden,We have our routine for Ackerman!
sarah,  We haven't had the pleasure.
borden,Mr.Fallon is my ingeneur- 
sarah,Where did yo get all of-
borden,"Begged, borrowed and don't ask. Mr.Fallon's an enterprising soul."
sarah,I need talk to you.
borden,We'll start making money once we have our audience-
sarah,And until then? What I earn is barely enough for us.
borden,  I'll give him half of my food.
sarah,You're already going to be sharing it with someone else.
borden,You're...?
sarah,Having a baby.
borden,The trick to wake up Ackerman at the end of my audition.
sarah,"Your great trick? The ""masterpiece that will make our fortunes""? "
borden,"No. The world isn't ready for that one, yet. Borden moves to the bureau and starts LOADING the gun. Pouring in SHOT, then WADDING..."
sarah,I'm not letting you get shot. Borden RAMS the bullet and charge down then removes the RAMROD and hands the pistol to Sarah.
borden,"It's perfectly safe. Shoot me. Sarah looks at Borden then down at the pistol. She aims at Borden. Then sims off, at a mirror beside him. BANG. Borden's hand SNAPS out to ""catch"" the bullet. The mirror is intact. Borden looks at Sarah, grave, as he reveals the bullet in his hand."
sarah,"Show me.  Then you're not doing it. I can't raise a child on my own, Alfred. Borden looks at her. Takes the bullet from her and places it on the bureau."
borden,"The bullet goes in the gun. Then comes the ramrod. He takes the RAMROD and PUSHES it down onto the bullet, which disappears."
sarah,Once you know it's so obvious.
borden,"Yes, well, people still get killed perfoming it."
sarah,How?
borden,Sme smart-arse drops something down the barrel.
sarah,Such as?
borden,"A penny, or a button. Or, of course, a bullet.  But don't fret-"
sarah,Say it again.
borden,I love you.
sarah,  Nope. Not today.
borden,What?
sarah,  It's alright. I like being able to tell the difference- it makes the days it is true mean something.
borden,Bloody fool.
policeman,"  It's all laid out down the end, you honour."
judge,What's in there?
cutter,Angier's machine.
judge,"You built this, Mr.Cutter?"
cutter,  A man who can actually do the things a magician pretends to... 
judge,"They've benn sold to a Lord Caldlo. An avid collector, apparently very interested in the case."
cutter,Don't let him take this.
judge,Why ever not?
cutter,It's dangerous.
judge,I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles it's get some simple and disappointing trick.
cutter,The most disappointing of all- it has no trick. It's real.
judge,This is the tank Angier drowned in?
cutter,This lets the performer's hands reach the trick padlock...
judge,A standard magical apparatus for escapes?
cutter,With one important difference...
judge,What a way to kill someone. Why in God's name go to such lengths?
cutter,"These are magicians, you honour. Showmen. Men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes brutal truths to amaze. To shock."
judge,Even without and audience?
cutter,"There was and audience.  See, the water tank had a particular signinficance for the two men..."
milton,Which of you brave souls is willing bind this lovely young woman?
angier,How can be not know?!
borden,"""How can be not know?!""   Because, Angier, life is complicated, people are complicated, knots are  COMPLICATED-"
judge,"Alfred Borden, you have been found guilty of the murder of Robert Angier. You will, in one month's time, be hanged by the neck until dead. May the Lord have mercy on your soul."
borden,They took her away?   To the workhouse?
alley,Tesla sends me down here during the storms. Perfect excuse to come shere a drink with the Great Danton.
angier,Why are you here?
alley,The lightning lives here. And noit much else- our work is secret.
angier,My profession also deals in secrets.
alley,Which is?
angier,We magicians have a circle of trust.
alley,You have a circle of trust with someone whose dairy you stole?
angier,Maybe I bought it.
alley,Magicians sell their secrets?
angier,It's how we pay for our retirements and how greats tricks outlive us.
alley,You're hoping to find a great secretin there?
angier,I've already found it. That's why I'm here.
alley,Why would you want the same thing?
angier,Call it a professional rivalry.
alley,"Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people, but he would never talk about it."
angier,I understand discretion. I just want the machine.
alley,Finish your drink. You'll have a special appreciation for our work.
angier,I thought it was a secret. 
alley,  You're a magician. Who's going to believe you?
alley,We do our tests when the townspeople are asleep- Mr.Tesla doesn't want to scare anyone.
angier,Where are the wires?
alley,Exactly.
angier,Where's the generator?
alley,You saw it last week.
angier,But that must be ten miles from here. 
alley,"Fifteen. And I have to ride all of them before I get to bed.  I'll send word for you in a few days, Mr.Angier."
voice,"Get out your gun, Professor!"
borden,A volunteer.
moustache,  Yes.
angier,Never thought I'd find an answer at the bottom of a pint glass.
cutter,Hasn't stopped you looking.   I heard about a booking. Nice little theatre. Good up-and-coming magician.
angier,Who?
cutter,You.
angier,You got me a booking? Why?
cutter,Because I want to keep working...  And who's going to hire the ingeneur who killed Julia McCullough in front of a sellout crowd at the Orpheum?
angier,Someone who know that it wasn't your fault. Someone who knows Alfred Borden and his repertoire of exotic knots.
cutter,Heard he had a spot of bad luck doing a bullet catch South of the river.
angier,"To die like that. Locked in water... lungs screaming...   What did she go through, Cutter?"
cutter,"I knew an old sailor. Told me about a time he got pulled over the side tangled in the sheets... they dragged him out, but it was five minutes before he coughed..."
angier,Which knot did Borden tie that night?
cutter,He wouldn't say.
angier,Wouldn't say?!
cutter,It was as if... as if he didn't know.
cutter,We'll have to whitewash the windows to cofound the more curious members of your audience...   But this should do. 
angier,We should see about an assistant.
cutter,I've made arrangements. Have you settled on a name?
angier,"Yes, I have. The Great Danton."
cutter,Hmm. Bit old-fashioned? Angier smiles gently at Cutter.
angier,No. It's sophisticated.
olivia,"What's so hard about this? Cutter leans into the cabinet and pops up a TRICK PANEl in the floor, revealing a tiny chamber."
cutter,"In here, Miss Wenscombe. No point meeting Mr.Angier unless you fit. Olivia shrugs and hands Cutter her hat, then her thick skirts, and folds herself into the bottom of the box."
sarah,"I don't understand, Alfred. How can it be bleeding again?"
borden,  We can' afford the doctor back! A BABY STARTS CRYING in the bedroom. Sarah glares at Borden.
sarah,You've woken her.
borden,I'm sorry. I just need this to heal so I can het back to work.
sarah,"Alfred, you have to face things. What tricks could you peform with this kind of injury?"
borden,"Some of the card pulls, prop tricks...  And the trick I've been telling you about. The trick they'll remember me for."
angier,The bird cage can't be our climax- everybody knows it.
cutter,"Not like this, they don't. "
angier,And I don't want to kill doves.
cutter,"  You're a magician, not a wizard- you have to get your hands dirty to achieve the impossible."
angier,You sound like him.
cutter, Put your hands on the sides...
angier,I need a volunteer.
cutter,"Hang on, hang on..."
merrit,"You'd beat not be intending to hut this animal, Mr.Angier."
angier,Of course not.
angier, ...THREE!
cutter,And the best part...
angier,Thought you said I had to get my hands dirty.
cutter,"Someday, perhaps you will. I needed to know that you can."
merrit,Very nice. Very nice indeed.
angier,"  I haven't had a chance to compliment you on your beautiful theatre yet, Mr.Merrit."
merrit,"A lot more beautiful when it's full, Mr.Angier."
angier,Don't worry.
merrit,"You all say that. Why sould I worry? If your tricks don't get 'em in, someone else's will. Maybe someone willing to do a bullet catch or a water scape."
cutter,"cheap thrills, Mr.Merrit. People hoping for an accident- and quite likely to see one, too. What would that do for your business?"
merrit,  You've got a week.
angier,"You sir, in the hat. Could you show us your handkerchief?"
man,This isn't mine.
angier,Perhaps you'd be so good as to return it to the other man. He has yours.
olivia,"I'm so nervous- I'm sorry, I'm making mistakes. Cutter quickly REMOVES Angier's coat..."
angier,"The audience doesn't seem to be responding much, Cutter. Cutter puts he LEATHER HARNESS over Angier's arms..."
cutter,This is a grand theatre with a sophisticated audience- They've seen most of these tricks before. But not this next one. You'll see. Cutter checks the SPRINGS of the harness and replaces Angier's coat. He spots a STAGEHAND poking his head around the flies.
angier,"Wish us luc, Cutter."
angier,You've seen this one before?
angier,"Well, I'll make it a little harder, shall I?"
angier,I should've spotted him. 
cutter,You had a lot of plates spinning.
angier,Don't suppose they'll let us do this one again.
cutter,No.
angier,So what's the climax of our show?
angier,"Mr.Merrit, we have a week's engagment-"
merrit,"To perform magic- not butcher birds and break my costomer's fingers! Clear out, anything here in the morning gets burned."
cutter,Mr.Merrit-
merrit,"It's done, John. I've hired a comedian. You know I hate comedians, which should indicate the may I felel about your friend's future as a stage magician."
cutter,There are plenty of good theatres... if we can come up with another trick and change the name of the act-
angier,The name stays.
cutter,"Right. Well, the new trick will have to be irresistible, then. I've a couple of methods to try out, but we'll need a fresh angle on the presentation. "
ticket hawker,"Would you like to know the future, sir? The man who kill change the world is speaking right now. Continents divided no more. Free, clean power. The mysteries of the world solved."
tesla,With a system like this I could have the entire city electrified whitin two years.
audience member,  Fraud.
borden,I love you.
sarah,"See? Today, it's true."
borden,Guard! Guard!!
guard,"What do want, Professor?"
borden,Paper and pencil. Please.
sullen,Let me see?
borden,  Only if I teach you how to read.
sullen,"Just stupid tricks, right? Haven't helped you get out of here-   Have they? Or can't you open real locks, Professor? "
borden,Perhaps I'm just biding my time. Perhaps one day I'll just hold up my
sullen,"How'd you get so famous, then? Borden STANDS."
borden,"Magic. Borden TURNS, NO LONGER CHAINED. Sullen JUMPS to his feet to follow, but HIS ANKLE IS CHAINED TO THE TABLE. The other PRISONERS are LAUGHING and CHEERING."
sullen,"Oi, Borden, get back here! Sullen FUMBLES with his keys as Borden takes a BOW. Another warder CRACKS Borden over the head with a TRUNCHEON. Sullen, now free, KICKS Borden in the ribs."
olivia,I don't really.... have anywhere to go. Angier slips the newspaper from the table.
angier,You've been sleeping here?
olivia,Cutter said it would be okay till we get another booking.
angier,"Researching. Part of a magician's job is to watch his competition, to see what illusions they're-"
olivia,"You're going to do something to that man, aren't you? Olivia moves closer. Angier is quiet."
angier,Even? My wife for a couple of his fingers? He has a child now. And he's perfoming again.
olivia,Us. Olivia moves towards him.
borden,I need a volunteer. Angier takes a few steps towards the stage. Borden produces a RUBBER BALL. he TOSSES the ball to Angier.
olivia,"What happened, Robert?"
angier,He had a new trick.
olivia,Was it good? 
angier,Did they applaud when you saw it?
cutter,Not very enthusiastically.
cutter,The trick is too good -- too simple- the audience harly knows what they've seen.
angier,He's a dreadful magician.
cutter,"He's a wonderfull magician- he's a dreadful showman. He doesn't know how to dress it up, how to sell the trick."
angier,How does he do it?
cutter,He uses a double.
cutter,You think that because you don't know the method. It's a double who comes out at the end. It's the only way.
angier,"I've seen his perfom ir three times now, Mr. Cutter- the Prestige is the"
angier,The same man comes out of the second cabinet. I promise you.
olivia,It is the same man. They both turn to look at Olivia.
angier,He doesn't know how to sell his trick to an audience. But I do. 
cutter,  It would give us our climax.
angier,The man stole my life. I'm going to steal his trick.
cutter,We'll have to find someone who can look like you on a stage.
angier,He doesn't use a double-
cutter,  Ang the only way I know is to find you a bloody good double.
angier,Take a good look- let's get out there and find me.
alley,It's perfectly safe.
tesla,So this is the Great Danton.
angier,"I saw a lecture you gave in London, several years ago. I'm flattered you agreed to see me. Tesla keeps hold as Angier's hand."
tesla,"Our bodies, Mr. Angier, are quite capable of conducting, and indeed, producing energy."
tesla,Alley has explained that you require a very interesting device.
angier,I need something impossible.
tesla,You're familiar with a phrase 'Man's reach exceeds his grasp'?   
angier,"If people thought the things I did on stage were real, they wouldn't clap- they'd scream. Think of saving a woman in half. Tesla nods. Considering."
tesla,"Mr.Angier, the cost of such a machine-"
angier,Price is not an object.
tesla,Perhaps not. But have you considered the cost?
angier,I'm noit sure I follow.
tesla,"I can make your machine, Mr. Angier. But I can also give you some advice..."
angier,Have your obsessions done you no good?
tesla,At first. But I've followed them too long- I am their slave. Their whipping boy. And one day they may choose to destroy me. Angier looks into Tesla's eyes.
angier,if you understand an obsession then you know you won't change my mind.
angier,Will you build it?
tesla,"I have already begun to build it, Mr. Angier. I hope you enjoy the mountain air. This will take time. Tesla disappears into the lab."
root,A pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.
angier,He's out of his mind.
olivia,He's an out-of-work actor- of course he's out of his mind.
cutter,"He's perfect. A little work, mind you, but when I'm done with him he could be your brother."
angier,I don't need him to be my brother. I need him to be me.
borden,Would you like to see a magic trick?
sarah,What is this for?
borden,You caught me in the wrong mood.
sarah,But you want through all the-
borden,"Sarah, I'm allowed to change my mind, aren't I? The act is taking off, maybe soon I'll get us into a bigger theatre. Things will work."
olivia,You walk through this one- then...?
olivia,Oof. Couldn't you find a softer one?
angier,  It's not for sleeping on.
olivia,And Root goes up through there? 
angier,It has to be. Borden's trick is getting noticed. The place was packed today.
olivia,You went and saw his show again?
angier,All I have to do is keep myself stinking drunk all the time and no one will be able to tell the difference.
cutter,"A little faith, sir. Could you favor us with a perfomance. Mr. Root?"
root,"You would drink, too, if you know the world half so well as I do."
cutter,You can go back to being yourself. Root. For free.. Root looks challengingly at both men.
root,"I'd rather be him, for now. I find it amusing. Root WAVES his hands across his chest, in the same manner that Angier does onstage. He produces a bottle of Gin from thin air, and takes a long swallow and jumps down to Olivia."
cutter,Root has to keep a low profile-- anyone sees him the game's up.
cutter,Have you thought about what we should call the trick?
angier,No point being coy. Borden calls his trick 'The Transported Man'? Cutter nods.
angier,"Ladies and gentlemen, much of what you've seen tonight can be termed illusions. Entertaining trifles of the sort you may have seen other magicians perform."
cutter,"The manager said he's never seen a reaction like it. Angier smiles, rueful."
angier,"At least he got to see it. I spent the ovation hidden under the stage. No one cares about the man who disappears, the man who goes into the box. They care about the man who comes out the other side."
olivia,"I care about the man in the box. Angier turns to Olivia, raises his glass."
angier,Thank you.
cutter,"Root, you bloody fool, get that costume and makeup off right now, anyone could walk in here!"
angier,I suppose I should get more rest.
olivia,"Life is not full of these moments, Robbie."
angier,The trick isn't good enough.
olivia,Didn't you see the audience?
angier,No.
olivia,"Well, they loved it."
angier,It's not as good as his trick.
olivia,Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours. He doesn't have any style-
angier,He doesn't have to spend the finale hiding under the stage.
olivia,Why?
angier,So that I can do it better. Angier turns to her. Looks her in the eye.
olivia,Work for him? Are you joking
angier,You'll be my spy.
angier,"It's how we advance. Angier moves to Olivia, placing his hands on her shoulders."
angier,Exactly why he'll want to hire you. He'll want my secrets.
olivia,Why would he trust me? Angier thinks for a second. Then smiles.
angier,Because you're going to tell him the truth.
tesla,"You must be curious to see what so much money had bought you, Mr. Angier."
alley,You might want to stand back.
tesla,"No, no. It will be fine. Mr. Alley, please proceed."
angier,I don't understand-
alley,Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it. We'll see you next week?
borden,We make do.
olivia,My name is Olivia Wenscombe.
borden,"I know who you are. Are you here to steal the rest of my show? Olivia sees one of the theatrical notices that litter the shop: ""THE GREAT DANTON BREAKS RECORD WITH HIS ASTONISHING"
olivia,No. I'm here to give your show what is missing.
borden,And what might that be?
olivia,Me.
olivia,I've left Angier. I want a job. Borden sits there.
borden,Why on earth shouldn't I trust you? The mistress of my enemy.
olivia,Mr.Borden-
borden,Alfred.
olivia,Alfred. I'm going to tell you the truth.
borden,"Ah. The truth. A slippery notion in our life of work, Miss Wenscombe."
olivia,I'm here because he sent me here. He wants me to come and work for you and steal your secret.
borden,"What does he need my secret for? His trick is top notch. The Great Danton vanishes and isntantly reappears on the other side of the stage -- mute, overweight, and, unless I'm mistaken, rather drunk."
olivia,"No. It's killing him. he's obsessed with discovering your method. He thinks of nothing else, and takes no pleasure in our sucess. I've had enough. There's no future with him. He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his."
borden,He has no secrets from me.
cutter,"Best be getting changed for the martinee, sir. - Angier nods. Cutter REALIZES."
root,No.
cutter,No?! Root looks at Cutter with genuine malice.
root,"We need to have a chat, Mr.Cutter."
angier,"We have a problem, Cutter. He holds up the paper, folded to an advertisement:"
cutter,We have a bigger problem. Root.
angier,Don't tell me he fell over again.
cutter,Worse. He realized he can make demands.
angier,He's blackmailing us? 
cutter,"In a word, yes. I'm surprised, to be honest- it usually takes them a lot longer to figure it out."
angier,How much does he want?
cutter,It makes no difference- we have to stop doing the trick.
cutter,"Look at yesterday's. And last week's, where they called you ""London's premiere stage performer"", not ""magician"" mind. Performer. Of any kind."
angier,What's the point?
cutter,"My point, Robert, is that you've climbed too high to get away with any kind of professional embarrassament. We're not doing any tricks we can't control. Angier considers this. Nods. Thinking."
angier,"Pay him whatever he wants, for now. We keep doing the trick till Borden opens, then we'll phase it out."
cutter,Get it down!
root,To what do I owe the pleasure of this rather welcome pint of ale?
borden,"You are the Great Danton, aren't you?"
root,Of course I am. But don't advertise it- I'll be mobbed with fans.  And who might you be? 
borden,Just a humble admirer. And fellow practitioner.
root,"Ah, very good. Root DOWNS the rest of his new pint, placing the empty glass in front of Borden with an emphatic THUNK."
borden,Another?
root,"If you insist. I'm not perfoming tonight. Well, only one show, and, to be frank, my people pretty much run things these days."
borden,You could probably do it blindfolded.
root,Bloody good idea.
borden,Have it.
root,Thanks. A new pint arrives. Root sips.
borden,"Actually, there's something I might warn you about."
root,Oh?
borden,"Well, it's your Transported Man illusion. Now, I'm noit claiming to know your method... but I had a similar trick in my act- and I used... (looks around,"
root,"Oh, I see, very good."
borden,"At first. Then it went bad. You se, I hadn't counted on the fact that once I incorporated this bloke into my act, he had complete power over me."
root,"Complete power, you say?"
borden,  You must be very careful about giving someone that power over you.
root,"Thanks for the warning.  INT. STAGE, EMPIRE THEATRE -- EVENING"
angier,"...some of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed, what you are about to see is considered safe..."
borden,"Great Danton, I must apologize! I simply had too much magic for my stage at the Pantages!"
cutter,"I don't see how Borden found him- I had him under wraps, I was careful."
angier,"Well, he did."
cutter,"Sit, do you think it might be her? Olivia?"
angier,No. I don't.
cutter,Shall we cut him down?
angier,He's the Great Danton. Let him cut himself down.
angier,You weren't expecting me?
olivia,"I was expecting you sooner, Robbie. Your message said ""afternoon"". "
angier,"Well, it takes a bit for me to get around these days..."
olivia,What do you mean? You sent me to-
angier,I sent you to steal his secret- not to improve his act-
olivia,That's my job-!
angier,Or to fall in love with him!
olivia,You abandoned me to him!
angier,  Yes? Then how does he do it?!
olivia,Cutter was right- it's a double.
angier,Of course Borden said that-
olivia,"He didn't say anything- he'd never say. I've seen things- make-up, glasses, wigs. We don't use any of it for the show, but I've found it hidden backstage."
angier,  It's misdirection- he leaves those things lying around to make you think he's using a double. 
olivia,All the time? He doesn't know when  I'M LOOKING-
angier,"All the time, Olivia- that's who he is, that's what it takes- he lives his act, don't you see?!   And just because you're sleeping with him doesn't mean he trusts you."
olivia,"You thing you can see everything, don't you?"
angier,You stole it?
olivia,"I borrowed it for tonight. I thought you'd be able to translate some of it, but now I realize-"
angier,I can't.
olivia,  You can't.
angier,"Olivia, no one could-   It's a cypher- with a transposition that probably shifts every day of the diary. Even with the keyword it would take months to decode..."
olivia,And without the keyword? 
angier,Perhaps never. We'll see.
olivia,"No, we won't- if I don't get that back tomorrow morning, he'll know I took it."
angier,"You can'r possibly think I'd let this go? This is his diary, Olivia. All of his secrets are right here, in my hands."
olivia,"  Don't do this do me, Robert!"
angier,  Leave him.
olivia,He knows where I live!
angier,I need to know his method.
olivia,"  It won't get your wife back, Robert."
angier,I don't care about my wife- I care about his secret!
olivia,He'll know it was you-
angier,"Yes, me, not you. Understand?"
olivia,"Robert? I have fallen in love with him. Angier looks at her, sympathetic."
angier,Then I know how hard this had been hard for you.
borden,Notebook. Fallon nods. Borden sighs. Weary.
borden,"I'm walking tonight, gentlemen. Fallon looks concerned."
cutter,I'll live.   You save me the trouble to making you an air hole!
borden,I'm impressed.
angier,Why's that?
borden,"You're finally getting your hands dirty. This is what a good trick costs, Angier. Risk. Sacrifice."
angier,"The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is all going to be yours. Unless you give me what I want."
borden,Which is?
angier,Your secret.
borden,My secret?
angier,"Your method for the Transported Man. Fallon wouldn't tell me. In fact, he doesn't talk at all."
borden,  You have my notebook.
angier,Useless without the keyword.
borden,The keyword is the method.
angier,How fast can you gid?
angier,How's the arm?
cutter,Still attached. Did you get your answer?
angier,"Our answer, Cutter. I haven't looked yet, I wanted you to share this."
cutter,"I already know how he does it, Robert. The same way he always has, the same way we do. You just want it to be something more."
angier,"Well, let's find out, shall we? "
cutter,What does it mean?
angier,"  It means, Cutter, that we have a journey ahead of us. To America."
cutter,"Robert, listen to me.  Obssession is a young man's game, I can't follow you any farther in this."
angier,Then the rest is up to me.
sarah,I didn't know we'd be joined for dinner.
borden,Absolutely. We're celebrating.
sarah,Miss Wenscombe. Mr.Fallon.
borden, Champagne. Your finest
sarah,"What are we celebrating, dear? "
borden,"Well, we've hit upon a new trick, haven't we, Fallon?"
olivia,"What trick, Freddy?"
sarah,"  Yes, ""Freddy"". What trick?"
borden,  I'm going to bury myself alive. Every night. Then someone's going to come along and dig me up! OTHER DINERS are glancing over. The waiter uncorks the bottle with a muffled POP and pours champagne into Borden's glass.
sarah,  I'm not sure my husband needs-
borden,Who are you to tell me what?!
olivia, PERHAPS-
sarah,"Perhaps, Mr.Fallon, you might escort Miss Wenscombe home. My husband's being a bore. I see no reason for the two of you to suffer as well."
olivia,"Good-night, Mrs.Borden. Good-night, Freddy."
sarah,"""Freddy""?"
borden,It's my name.
sarah,Not at home. 
borden,I'm not always at home.
sarah,"Alfred, why are you being like this?"
borden,"Sarah, I had a terrible ordeal today. I thought I'd lost something very precious to me."
sarah,What?
borden,"Secrets are my life, Sarah. Our life."
sarah,"When you're like this, Alfred, I'm not seeing the real you. You're treating me like your audience. Performing. I can't live with that."
angier,I thought I had the place to myself.
manager,Unexpected guests.  Not very polite. A lot of questions. At first I thought they might work for the government. 
angier,No?
manager,  Worse. They work for Thomas Edison.
olivia,"No. It's killing him. He's obssessed with discovering your method. he thinks of nothing else, and takes no pleasure in our success. I've had enough. There is no future with him. He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his."
borden,He has no secrets from me.
olivia,No. This is what he told me to tell you. Beat.
borden,"I can spot Angier's methods from the back of the theatre. What could you possibly have to offer me? Olivia smiles, moves to Borden, reaching for his gloved hand. Borden flinches, surprised."
olivia,You may know he does his tricks... but you can't understand why no one can see that yours are better. She tenderly PEELS OFF his padded glove revealing his mutiladed hand.
olivia,Then let people know. You can be so much more then he is. I can show you how. Borden looks into her eyes.
olivia,Robbie's blinded by his jealosy. He'd do anything for you secret. Sending me away was the least of it. Borden considers this.
angier, TESLA!    TESLA!!
angier,I've veen played for a fool!
alley,Who by?
angier,Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for.
alley,We never said he had.
angier,"You let me believe that he had, Alley!   "
alley,Where?
angier,In the hotel. I've every mind to bring them up here myself-
tesla,"That would be unwise, Mr.Angier."
alley,"Sir, my cat?"
angier,Then why isn't the machine working?
tesla,"Because exact science, Mr.Angier, is not an exact science. The machine simply does not operate as expected. It needs continued examination."
angier,Where did my top hat go?
alley,Nowhere.
tesla,Which is why we need to rey a different material. It may provoke a different result. Tesla opens the cage and points the open end at Alley.
alley,"You are responsible for whatever happens to this animal, Doctor. Alley pulls himself out of the pit, and Tesla CHARGES the generator. The cat stares up at the machine around it and HISSES. Without ceremony, Tesla FIRES the machine. As before, large BOLTS spew from the head of the machine, down towards the unseen cat. The machine build to a DEAFENING ROAR, then sputters out. Silence. The three men begin edging towards the pit. Suddenly, a terrifying SCREECH. The cat is still there, still tied to the hook. Alley breathes a sigh of relief and starts to free the car. Tesla looks frustated. Suddenly, the cat bursts free of Alley and ROCJETS through the open side door of the lab."
angier,I'll go. Angier limps after the cat.
angier,"Here, kitty, kitty."
angier,So the machine was working?
alley,I never bothered to check the calibration. The hat never moved.
tesla,"These things never quite work as you expect them to, Mr. Angier. That's one of the principal beauties of science."
angier,Which one is mine?
tesla,"They are all your hat, Mr. Angier. Tesla smiles at him."
jess,"Are we going to the zoo this afternoon, daddy?"
borden,Daddy's got some business this afternoon.
jess,But you promised.
borden,"Did I? Jess nods at him, solemly."
jess,"That's you, daddy? Borden picks up the girl off of his lap and stands."
borden,"Daddy has some errands to run. I'll be back before you know it, so get ready."
sarah,"We each have our vices. Borden moves to her, gentle concern in his eyes."
borden,"Sarah. Whatever you may think, your only competitions for my affections is my little girl. I love you. I will always love you, and you alone. She looks into his eyes. Fascinated."
sarah,You mean it today.
borden,Absolutely.
sarah,That makes it so much harder when you don't. She turns from him. Borden watches her sadly. Leaves.
borden,"More shopping. She doesn't like the smell of money, doesn't she? Fallon looks away. Borden tears up the paper."
olivia,What is it. Freddy?
borden,"Please don't call me that. It's nothing, just... sometimes things seem... wrong."
olivia,"Freddy, I've told you before. When you're with me, you're with me. Leave your family at home where they belong."
borden,"I'm trying, Olivia. Please."
olivia,I'll get dressed.
borden,You trust me?  Then trust Fallon- he protects the things I care about.
manager,"We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier."
angier,What box?
manager,We never use these rooms in the off - season. It's a shame. 
angier,"Yes, you, Borden. Sitting there, in your cell, reading my diary. Awaiting your death. For my murder. "
owens,Lord Caldlow was happy to hear that you'd reconsidered his offer.
borden,"Angier's journal, the ""gesture of good faith""? It's a fake."
owens,  I assure you it's not.
borden,It has to be- it refers to events that happened after his death.
owens,"Clever predictions, I'm sure. The provenance of the journal is clear and under no doubt. It's written in Angier own hand, of which we have numerous examples.  What makes you think it's a fake?"
borden,It doesn't matter.
owens,Including the Transported Man? Lord Caldlow will be very pleased.
borden,No he won't. They're not complete- you only have the Pledge and Turn for each.
owens,Without the Prestige for each trick these are wothless. 
borden,You'll get the rest after you bring my daughter here.
sarah,"Deny it all you want- I know!  INT. LIVING ROOM, BORDEN'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS"
borden,"Sarah, it's not true! I've told you Olivia means nothing to me!"
sarah,"I'll go yo her! I know what you really are, Alfred!"
borden,  Sarah. You can't do that.
sarah,I can't live like this! 
borden,"Not today. Sarah takes this in. Borden watches, helpless."
who's there,Cutter turns. A STAGEHAND. His eyes are solid white. The man is clearly BLIND.
cutter,I- I'm looking for an old friend-
cutter,You came back.
angier,"It's a good to see you, John. Cutter sizes Angier up. Looks around the theatre."
cutter,Good rehearsal space. Blind stagehands. I like it-
angier,"I need your help, John. My last show. A limited engagement."
cutter,Your last show?
angier,A wise man once told me that obsession was a young man's game. I'm almost done. One thing left...  The real Transported Man.
cutter,You want to design a show around it?
angier,"i don't want you backstage, I need you front of house, managing."
cutter,What sort of booking are you after?
angier,The sort that Borden can't ignore. Cutter looks at Angier. Nods.
driver,"This is the address, sir."
cutter,"Mr.Ackerman. It's an honor to see you again, sir."
ackerman,When you said you only wanted to show me one trick it piqued my interest.
cutter,It's a very special trick. Mr.Ackerman.
angier,"Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ackerman."
ackerman,"Likewise, I'm sure. Let's get on, shall we?"
cutter," Turn it on, please."
ackerman,Very pretty.
ackerman, EXACTLY-
angier,Are you interested in helping us?
ackerman,  Yes. But you'll have to dress it up a little. Disguise it. Give them enough reason to doubt it. 
ackerman,I have an act for your venue.
ackerman,Get rid of them. This is a magical act. An excellent one. I believe you booked his first engagement several years ago. The Great Danton.
merrit,You really want me to- Ackerman stands.
olivia,"You haven't spopken about her, Freddy. Not once."
borden,Who?
olivia,Don't be cruel.
borden,Why would I talk about her to you?
olivia,Because she was part of your life and now she's gone.
borden,  I never loved Sarah.
olivia,"  You married her, had a child with  HER-"
borden,Part of me loved her. But part of me didn't. The part that found you. The part that's sitting here now. I love you. That is the truth that matters.
olivia,You could be sitting in some other restaurant talking to some other woman about me that way. It's unhuman to be so cold.
borden,He's back?
olivia,After two years. And he has a new trick. They're saying it's the best that London's ever seen.
angier,"Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick of the evening is one that involves considerable risk.  Anyone in the audience who would be irrevocable damaged by seeing a man drown should leave now, for when I tell you that the young lady who taught performing it, you will understand the seriousness of the danger involved."
angier,"In my travels I have seen the future, and it is a strange future indeed. The world is on the brink of new and terrifying possibilities. The audience RECOILS in terror as the MACHINE is STARTED and BOLTS fly from it. SMOKE drift over the audience. Borden inches forward in his seat. Angier stands in front of the machine, silhouetted by the FRENZY of electricity behind him. He TOSSES his cane to his assistant and steps into the machine. The audience SCREAMS as large bolts BLAST from the machine and wrap themselves around ANGIER'S ARMS and legs. Borden is watching very carefully. Angier is almost impossible to see as the machine builds to a climax, but, just before it does; Borden catches a glimpse of ANGIER'S"
borden,"Why only 100 performances? Do his methods dictate it, or is it simply a publicity move? Borden walks back and stares at the sketch."
blind stagehand, WHO'S THERE!
cutter,It's Cutter.
blind stagehand,What do you want?
cutter,I'm looking for Angier.
angier,You found him.
cutter,What are they doing?
angier,Disposing of the Prestige materials.
cutter,What's down there?
angier,Do you really want to know? Cutter considers Angier's grave tone.
cutter,Perhaps not. Cutter leaves by the stage door.
borden,"They do this every night. After each performance? Fallon nods. Borden gets to his feet with a sigh. Turns to a POSTER on the wall- ""The Great Danton Perform THE REAL"
stagehand,Where'd you think you're going?
borden,"I'm part of the act, you fool!"
cutter,Who was that?
cutter,What did you do?
judge,"You will, in one month's time, be hanged by the neck until dead. May the Lord have mercy on your soul. "
owens,Mr.Cutter?   Owens.
cutter,"Thank you for coming, Mr.Owens. It's fallen to me to dispose of Mr.Angier's equipment. Looking at the manifest, it's cleat that Lord Caldlow has purchased the bulk of the items."
owens,"Mr.Cutter, if you needed to know where to deliver the items you surely could have just-"
cutter,"It's not just that, Mr.Owens. There is a particular item  This time, in fact, that I wish to... well, that is to say, I want to-"
owens,You wnat to buy it instead.
cutter,"I suppose so, yes."
owens,This is the machine?   I'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant about procuring this particular item.
cutter,Perhaps if I dould talk to Lord Caldlow in person.
owens,"Out of the question, I'm afraid."
sullen,"  Still here, Borden?"
borden,For now.
sullen,Got a visitor. Lord Caldlow. With a little girl.
borden,"Jess, how are you?"
jess,"Can I come in there, Daddy? "
borden,Everything's going to be okay. It is only then that he notices the HAND ON HER SHOULDER. He rises to come face-to-face with Lord Caldlow-
borden,I saw you die. Angier just SMILES.
angier,"They flatter you with all those chains, Alfred. Don't they know you can't escape without your little rubber ball? Borden says nothing."
borden,You were always afraid to get your hands dirty... (looks down at his
angier,"No. Not anymore. And I win. Because no one cares about the man in the box, the man who disappears."
borden,You win. But don't take my little girl... Angier looks at Borden. Bitter
angier,"I know how hard it is to have someone so precious taken away, don't I   "
borden,Wait. Don't you want this? You paid for it.
angier,Your secret.
borden,Angier! Let me say good-bye. Please.
jess,"When are you taking me home, Daddy?"
borden,Soon. I promise. Soon.
angier,"For God's sake, Borden."
borden,"Daddy's coming, I promise. I promise.  HERE-"
housekeeper,"Come here, love.   Sir, there's gentleman waiting."
captain,Dead God.
angier,"Hello, Cutter."
cutter,You're alive.   How?
angier,  I learned an American accent from-
cutter,"  How are you alive, Robert?! I saw you on the slab, for God's sake. "
angier,I magician never reveals his secrets.
housekeeper,"Go on, child."
angier,"Good night, Jess."
cutter,Who's the girl?
angier,She needs looking after-
cutter,"She needs her father, but you're letting him hang. And I helped you."
angier,You don't have to. I'm going to make sure the machine. is never used again.   A good magician never repeats his tricks. 
cutter,"Then, Lord Caldlow, where would like me to deliver it?"
angier,My theatre. It belongs with the Prestige materials.
cutter,I once told you about the sailor who described drowing to me...
cutter,I was lying. He said it was agony.
borden,We go alone now- both of us. Only I don't have as far to go as you.
cutter,Thank-you gents.
workman,Where do you want it?
cutter,Don't worry. Someone's coming to help. The workmen levae. Cutter looks at the crate. Angier emerges from the darkness.
cutter,I'm bringing this over after we're done.
angier,"Cautions as ever, Cutter. No one's going to use the place. I own it."
cutter,No room left- you couldn't have acommodated 100 performances.
angier,It's a good thing I retired early then. Angier puts the lattern and his cane on the lif of the crate and the two men heft ir off the platform.
cutter,"I'll go mix the cement. Cutter looks at Angier, cold."
angier,"Cutter, I tried not to involve you. Cutter looks at Angier. Nods. Then disappears into darkness."
warden,"Alfred borden, on this day, in the name of the King and the high court of England, you will meet your end. Do you have anything to say for yourself. Borden saus nothing. The Warden gestures to the HANGMAn who begins to PULL the lever."
angier,You were Fallon. The whole time... Fallon/Borden's face disappears as Cutter seals his coffin.
borden,We were both Fallon. And we were both Borden.
angier,Were you the one who went into the  BOX-
angier,Cutter knew. But I told him it was too simple. Too easy.
borden,"Simple, maybe. But not easy."
angier,What about Olivia? And your wife?
borden,"We each loved one of them. We each had half a full life. Enough for us, but not for them. Borden puts the ball in his pocket. Tears in his eyes."
borden,It takes nothing to steal someone else's work.
angier,It takes everything.
angier,  It didn't work.
angier,"  Do you want to see what it cost me? You didn't see where you are, did you? Let me show you."
borden,  You went halfway around the world. You spent a fortune. You did terrible things... and all of it for nothing.
angier,"Nothing? You never understood, id you? Why we did this?   You really don't know?"
