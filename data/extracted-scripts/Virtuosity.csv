Speaker,Dialogue
virtuosity," by  Eric Bernt  THIRD REWRITE   August 24, 1994"
parker barnes,"His body is a running back's. His endurance a marathoner's. His face one you'd want for your own. He's in his 30s. If he was in his 20s, you'd still be jealous."
john,I can't get over how different you look.
parker," Five years can be a bitch, huh?"
john," Lady, move!"
parker, Where's John?
parker,"Recital's over, asshole."
parker,SHIT!
deane, What did Cox pull him out early for?
wallace,"Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?"
deane, Don't remind me.
parker, SOMEBODY.. .DO SOMETHING!
deane, What the hell happened?
wallace," Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real."
deane," Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world."
wallace, I was assured the problem was corrected.
lindenmeyer,I did fix it.. I told you I did. I don't know why it happened again.
deane,Again?!
cox, My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
deane, Why wasn't I told?
wallace,"Black book dollars, black book operation. You pay me for results, not how for how I get you there."
cox, I'll tell you one thing - there is no way in hell we should allow any real officers to train in this damn thing.
deane,Then about all I've spent $37 million developing is a very expensive way to control the prison population.
parker, He...only had a year left on his sentence.
lindenmeyer, How much do you think I care?
cox,I'll walk him out.
parker, Why'd.. .you pull me out?
cox,"Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you.  You may not believe this, Parker,"
cox,What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
parker,He was a computer program for crissake.
cox,You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
parker,"Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?"
cox,"Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar  you making it okay in there?"
parker, I'm getting by.
cox, You've got to know I tried keeping you out of general population. Goddam politicians...
parker," I'm becoming something else, and it scares the hell out of me."
parker," But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days."
cox,"Don't give up, Parker. Not ever."
parker, You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
cox,What about them?
parker, Do me a favor  keep sending them.
cox,"Take care, pal."
guard, Hey Parker  I'm real sorry John boy got fried. What do you think Big Red's gonna do when he finds out you came back without his girl friend?
lindenmeyer, Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
lindenmeyer,Think hard -- it'll come to you...
wallace,You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
lindenmeyer,The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
wallace,Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
lindenmeyer,I'm still making adjustments...
wallace,"You've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired."
lindenmeyer, I'M WHAT?!
wallace," You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?"
lindenmeyer, I understand... I understand perfectly.
wallace, How does he know who I am?
lindenmeyer, He hears...everything.
wallace," As a matter of fact, I do."
wallace,This is Wallace...
red,Time to hurt...
guard,Fun's over.
nurse,"I still don't know why they wasted this fancy, new technology on you. Every time I fix you up, you only go and mess it up again."
nurse,Tell me how this feels...
parker,OW!
nurse, I'll dial it down a little.
parker,It'll never feel right.
nurse,At least they work. Would you rather have no hands at all?
parker,Sometimes.
wallace,"Congratulations, Reilly..."
reilly,"As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well."
wallace,"As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month."
reilly,"Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow."
wallace, Do they have to look so...robotic?
reilly,"At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?"
lindenmeyer,All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
lindenmeyer," It was you, wasn't it?"
lindenmeyer,"You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!"
lindenmeyer, My God...
lindenmeyer,"What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?"
lindenmeyer," Hey, Reilly, Sheila 3.2's been asking for you..."
madison, The cuffs won't be necessary.
guard,"No offense, ma'am, but I don't think that's such a good idea."
madison,"I would like the following three things in this order: your mouth shut, his cuffs off, and your ass outside the door. Any questions?"
parker,You actually listen to all those tapes?
madison, How you feeling today?
parker,A little less than yesterday.
madison,"In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?"
parker,John died.
madison,"I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation."
parker,You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it  I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
madison,"That's not true, Parker."
parker,"If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence."
madison, What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
parker,Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
madison,"You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target..."
parker,Go to hell.
madison,"It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved."
parker,Enough!
madison,GET OUT!
parker,I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
reilly,"Oh, believe me, it is. It is..."
reilly,HEY!!!
lindenmeyer,Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
reilly, I haven't been working on anything.
lindenmeyer, Do I get to see it or not?
reilly," Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back."
lindenmeyer,All my work is my finest.
lindenmeyer, Get that fucking thing away from me!
reilly, You're...such a wimp.
lindenmeyer," It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules..."
reilly, Coordinated by polymer neural net.
lindenmeyer, It feels so.. .real.
reilly,It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
lindenmeyer, This is supposed to be years away.
reilly,"As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away."
lindenmeyer, How do you kill it?
reilly,Separate the character module from the neural net...
lindenmeyer,"Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is."
reilly,"I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you..."
lindenmeyer,I think I understand what you have in mind...
lindenmeyer,You need a maid.
reilly,What I need is a nymphomaniac.
reilly,"It feeds on what is basically amniotic fluid.  In eight hours, we are going to have ourselves one hell of a play toy."
reilly," Baby, what I'm gonna do to you..."
lindenmeyer,SID  NO!!!
reilly, This... isn't.. .possible!
parker, You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
cox,"Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane."
parker, It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee?
deane,"I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up"
parker,Only because I got pulled out early.
deane,Nobody else ever got anywhere near him. Nobody else... understands him like you do.
cox,"These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?"
parker,I've seen worse.
cox,Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
deane, You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
cox,Whatever.
parker, Can you kill it?
cox,If you can catch him.
deane,Think you can do it?
parker, Not from in here.
deane, This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release.
cox,Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
deane, Catch him and your record's clean.
parker,What happens if I can't catch him?
deane,"If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence."
parker,How do you know I won't run?
deane,This is the newest technology approved for general implementation. It's called a locater implant. Every parolee gets one.  We're going to know where you are every second for the rest of your life.
cox," If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself."
deane," Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?"
cox,There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
deane,But only you will know he's not human.
madison,"Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?"
deane,"We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment."
madison,What's the assignment?
deane,You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
madison, What exactly am I going to be doing in the field?
anesthetist, You are right on the border of his corpus callosuni.
surgeon,"He is under, isn't he?"
anesthetist," Won't stop him from dreaming, though..."
madison,This is Parker Barnes six years ago. The most decorated cop in the history of L. A. P. D. Special Investigations Division...
deane," That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?"
madison," Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous."
deane,Not if you're with him every step of the way.
madison,"The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again."
deane,"I understand the risks involved here. But there is nobody better qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes. And, there is nobody who knows him better than you. If a situation becomes volatile, you will find a way to quell it. I have complete confidence in you."
parker, I don't need a babysitter.
madison,What you need is a collar.
cox, She's going to help you understand
parker,What she's going to do is get in my way.
cox,"This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use."
parker,"She wasn't part of the deal, Cox."
cox,Fine  you want to stay here?
parker,Their weapons missing?
parker,Where's my gun?
cox,Be careful with it.
madison, You remember how to get to Toluca Lake?
madison,What are you doing?!
parker," Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie."
madison,It wasn't a lie.
parker,"Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it."
madison,You all right?
parker," See, I'm a good liar."
reporter," As L. A. P. D. Officers continue gathering evidence at this grisly crime scene, you can only ask yourselves what kind of lunatic would commit such unthinkable crimes?"
madison, You ready for this?
parker,"Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody."
madison, He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
parker,Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
madison,Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done.
parker,"Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends."
madison,"I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  The question is, what does Charlie"
parker,I know who would know.
madison, You drive well for somebody who hasn't done it in five years.
parker,Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
madison,He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
parker,What happened when he was 17?
madison,Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
undercover,"None, yet."
madison,Mind if we take a look inside?
undercover,"Not until somebody gets a search warrant signed. It's Sunday. I don't think they've even found a judge, yet."
madison,Do what you've got to do.  So will I...
madison, You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
parker,"Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it."
parker, Bang...
parker,What are you doing?
madison," You enjoy frightening me, don't you?"
parker,"You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?"
madison,This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
parker," Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him..."
madison,I'm still working on it.
parker,"I've been in prison, remember?"
madison,The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
parker,Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
madison, I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
parker," ... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz,"
madison,I am impressed.
parker," For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ."
madison,Who said that?
parker,Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do
madison, He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
madison,Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
parker, Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
madison,"But rather than selecting pieces from each individual, he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones."
parker,"This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you."
madison,"As a matter of fact, it is."
parker,Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
madison,Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
parker,What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
madison,"In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick..."
alexiev," Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies..."
parker,Can you tell us what's on the disc?
alexiev," There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it."
madison,Think you can get into the program?
alexiev, Hard to say  Lindenmeyer's protection mechanisms were always diabolically clever.
parker,You should see what he's been up to recently.
businessman, You one of them New Age assholes?
businessman,"Listen, buddy...thinking big is fine.. .but you shouldn't forget where you come from, either."
businessman,What for?
deane,What are they doing in Los Feliz?
cox, Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
deane,Why would they be going there?
cox,I don't know.
deane,I wish we could hear them.
wallace,My engineers say the audio tap should be ready to field test in six months.
madison,"Not this one, but the next one. The one with the bicycle out front..."
parker,I'll wait out here.
madison,Give me your wrist.
parker,Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
madison,And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
karin,Mommy's home! Mommy's home!
madison,"Grimes, you better not be the dominant."
parker,Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
madison,How did you get your hand out?
parker,"Sometimes, I like being part machine."
madison,I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
parker," She's beautiful, you know?"
madison,Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
parker,Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
madison,"I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes."
parker,You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
madison, Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
parker,What does that mean?
madison,"Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve."
parker,Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
madison,"What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before."
parker,"Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee."
parker,I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
madison,"You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant..."
parker,"Don't worry about it, all right?"
madison,"Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I..."
parker,Relax. I know what you meant.
madison,I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
parker,Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
madison,That's only a couple blocks from here.
parker,I'll meet you there.
madison, Don't get out of the car.
parker,Stop me.
madison,Parker! PARKER!  Shit!
madison,What the hell's going on?!
parker,This is my area of expertise.
madison, What did you do to those people?
parker,Nothing.
parker,"Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?"
madison, Enjoying yourself?
parker,You know I am.
madison,"This isn't a game, Parker!"
parker, Tell him.
madison, That who I think it is?
parker," Call me whatever you want, asshole."
parker,The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
parker, You and me have nothing in common.
madison,You have nothing in common.
parker, Still got your gun?
traffic cop,"You better be a cop, pal!"
traffic cop,Show me...
parker,Nail the fucker.
parker,What's the problem?
madison,I'm doing the best I can!
cox, I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
madison,Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
cox,"None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?"
madison,"Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure."
cox,"In other words, we collectively don't know shit."
wallace, I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
deane," The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage."
reporter,"Police now believe there to be a connection between the grisly Toluca Lake murders yesterday afternoon, and the hostage situation which occurred last night in a downtown bar..."
cashier,Next.  Did you know those aren't even baked? They're chemicallyrisen.
alexiev,I'm afraid I don't have very good news.
madison,Were you able to get into the program?
alexiev,Yes. But then I tripped over an erasure mine.
parker,"In English, please."
alexiev,I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
parker, It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
alexiev,"Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful."
madison,Let us know.
reporter, ... commuters travelling anywhere near the Biltmore Hotel downtown tomorrow evening should allow themselves at least 30 extra minutes to get home. Security for the Mayor Bennett's ReElection Rally is going to be so tight that all bus and subway routes passing through the area are being rerouted...
skinhead,"You don't wanna fuck with me, man."
madison, Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
parker,Start of what?
madison,"I don't know, yet. What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.  Whatever it is, he isn't finished..."
madison, You mind playing that part again?
madison,Freeze it there
parker,You like baseball?
parker, This is Officer Parker Barnes. Get every able body you can to Dodger Stadium -- J Section.
officer,What the hell's going on?
parker, Live execution.
boyfriend,"You make a better door than a window, buddy. Keep it moving."
guard,I nailed the sonof-abitch. I put a hole right through him...
madison,SLOW DOWN!
madison,Parker.. .Parker!
security robot, Stop. You are in violation of...
parker,Real effective security...
madison,"You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?"
parker,Authority still makes me nervous.
madison,Which way?
parker,Both.
madison,SHIT!
parker, Everybody get down!
madison, What were you shooting at?
parker, Sid's getting away.
madison,Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you
parker," If you're gonna do it, better do it now."
madison,Dammit!
madison,Let me help you...
college student, What did I do?...I didn't do anything...
parker, I lost him...
college student,GET HIM AWAY FROM ME! GET HIM AWAY!
madison, Call 9-1-1. Wait for me above ground.
madison, Do you have any idea the trauma you put that kid through?!
parker, That's Grimes...
madison, Get a hold of yourself!
parker," But he's in there. And you knew it, didn't you? Didn't you?!"
guard,Hands up! Now!
madison, What's going on?
guard,He's going back where he belongs.
deane," Enjoy the rest of your sentence, Mr. Barnes."
guard, Let's go.
madison,Parker...
madison, I should have told him.
cox,"Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?"
madison,I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
cox, You think he's smart?
madison,"Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming."
parker,What the hell's going on?!
parker,You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
parker,"GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!"
parker,DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
parker,Shit!
aide,Parker Barnes just escaped from the prison transport. Both of the guards are dead.
cox, Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
deane,"He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?"
cox,Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
deane,"You already have staked your reputation.  The fail-safe online, yet?"
wallace,Online and at your disposal.
cox, What failsafe?
deane," This had better work, Mr. Wallace."
madison,"Oh, shit!"
madison, There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
cox,I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
madison,I need your help--
cox,Why didn't anybody tell me?!
madison,I don't set policy.  You have the key?
cox, This is a police department. I'll be damned if this is going to go on without my knowledge.
cox,"Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach."
madison,Got it.
technician,Who are we going to fry?
wallace,Just an unrepentant criminal who is apparently going to die from a previously undiagnosed brain tumor.
cox,Just paying my last respects.
wallace,What happened?!
technician,I don't know. We've lost all power!
cox,The heat's been causing brown out's all over the city. Get above ground until it's restored.
madison,We know you didn't kill those guards.
parker,"They're going to fry me for it, anyway."
cox,Nobody's going to fry anybody...
cox," Don't worry, they have no idea where you are."
parker,You sonofabitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
madison,He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
parker, You knew the entire time? Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now?
cox,"She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did."
parker, Then I guess we're even.
madison, How did you find out about the toxin?
parker,Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
madison,You're not capable of it.
parker,"I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?"
madison,I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
cox,"The sonofa-bitch is still out there, Parker."
parker," When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?"
cox,"On my life, I promise you I will."
parker,"If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself."
foreman,Who the hell are you?
madison,"The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?"
parker,"I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious."
parker,Part of him is.
parker,See something?
madison,I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
parker,Nice work.
madison, Thanks.
sniper," Say goodbye, Parker Barnes..."
parker,Why's that?
cox,"Hey, Sid, what were you planning on doing with the C-4?"
parker,NOOOOOO!
his pov,Sid 6.7 lands on top of a garbage truck passing beneath the bridge. The garbage truck disappears beneath the bridge.
madison, I figured you'd show up sooner or later...
parker,Where did you plant the C-4?!
madison, Find out anything?
parker,"A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where."
lindenmeyer, There is only one way to get any
madison,Can I ask you something?
parker, You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
madison, Why are you going to do this?
parker,You don't know?
madison, That's why I'm asking.
parker,"Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am"
parker,Where did you plant the C-4?!
parker, You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
lindenmeyer,"I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world."
madison, What's wrong with Parker?
lindenmeyer, How should I know?
madison, Show me his physical sensory level.
lindenmeyer,I wonder how that...
parker," Don't move, and don't make a sound. Got it?"
madison,What's wrong?
lindenmeyer,He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
madison,Talk so I can understand.
lindenmeyer,"If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR."
madison,Then fix it.
lindenmeyer,I need you to hold this. It can't get any dirt on it.
parker,I thought you liked me being in the audience. Don't you want me to see it?
parker, You are going after Mayor Bennett.
parker,Aren't you going to watch with me?
parker,What are you talking about?
parker," Madison, get me out of here! MADISON!"
lindenmeyer, She's taking a nap at the moment.
lindenmeyer,"Come on, live. Live!"
parker,MADISON!!!
lindenmeyer,Of course you are.
lindenmeyer,Help me get out of here.
lindenmeyer, What...are you doing?!
lindenmeyer,I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
madison,You okay?
parker, ...I think so...You?
madison, More or less.
parker,Lindenmeyer?
madison,My guess is dead.
parker,Sid?
madison,I don't know.
parker," Elizabeth Deane, please. Tell her it's Parker Barnes..."
deane,"Barnes, where the hell have you been?!"
parker,Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
deane,What did you find out?
parker,Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
deane,It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
parker,"No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?"
deane,Enough to level an entire city block.
parker,"If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel."
deane, Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
parker," Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena."
deane,You know how much man power you're talking about?
parker,You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
deane, This better not be a wild goose chase.
parker,"Or what, you'll authorize my death a second time today?"
deane," Don't forget, convict, if this psycho isn't stopped, you go right back to rotting in a prison cell."
madison,"Give him a break, would you?"
male voice, This is demo team 27 leader. I think we just found what we've been looking for...
team leader,One more and we're home free...
deane,Thank God.
deane, What's the problem?
team leader,"The good news is, we're finished here. The bad news is..."
aide,You've got a phone call.
parker," You son-ofabitch, I'm going to kill you."
parker," I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else."
alexiev,I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
parker,Jesus Christ.  Lindenmeyer.
madison,Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
guest conductor," Are you just going to stand there, or do you want something?"
parker,"Listen to me, a bomb is planted somewhere in the Hollywood Bowl! Evacuate everybody!"
female voice,"I'm sorry, sir, I don't have the authorization to do that."
parker,Then put somebody on who does!
male voice,What's seems to be the problem?
parker,You've got to stop the concert! A bomb is going to go off!
male voice,"I'm sorry, sir, the concert has already started."
parker," Hey, old buddy, old pal, good to see you again."
parker,"Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?"
madison,"Hey, Parker..."
parker,How's your pulse?
madison, I couldn't tell you.
parker,Then shoot him already.
madison,Duck!
madison,What do we do now?
parker,You won't want to watch. Turn around.
madison,What should we do with it?
parker,Mind if I borrow a couple of your tools for a second?
driver,Be my guest.
parker,Care to join me?
