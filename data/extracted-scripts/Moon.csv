Speaker,Dialogue
in the black:," We hear something -- a machine -- CHURNING and POUNDING. Constant. Rhythmic. Though the sound is slightly familiar, we're not sure what it is yet. Hold for a few seconds and then  CUT TO:"
sam,"Tess. Hi. It's me. How are you, sweetheart? It's the morning here. In a few minutes Gerty and I will sit down for breakfast, go over the day's itinerary."
photograph," Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam with his arms wrapped around his wife of four years, TESS BELL.  SAM  And I have Eve. I don't take you guys for granted. You know that now. "
sam,"Please kiss Eve for me. And tell her daddy will only be away a little longer -- seventeen days longer, approximately. I love you both dearly. Bye."
sam,"Morning, Gerty."
gerty,"Morning, Sam. How are you today?"
sam,Fine. Fine. You?
gerty,I'm very well. How's your headache?
sam,"Much better, thanks, pal.  Sam treats Gerty more like a person than a robot. Whether this is down to Gerty's intelligence or Sam's desperation for company isn't clear just yet.  Note: Gerty talks like a well-educated older man. His language doesn't have a great deal of inflection  but he is friendly enough.  Sam switches a dial on a radio but gets nothing but static - - he sticks in a mini cd and skips the first few tracks. We hear brief clips of talk radio and shuttle through it before he allows it to play on, on some random American station -- an old weather report:  VOICE ON RADIO ...it's a hot one on the East Coast, temperatures soaring to a high of ninety three degrees in New York City --  They zip around the tiny kitchen, together preparing Sam's breakfast, working as a team.  CUT TO:"
sam,"8:32 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 1. All Harvesters running smoothly this morning. Readouts are as follows: Matthew, 14.6 miles;"
sam,"Gerty, we've got a live one on Mark. I'm going out now to rope her in."
gerty's voice,"Okay, Sam."
sam,"Sam Bell reporting to Central. 10:14 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 1.  Otherwise, everything running smoothly. There was a discrepancy between a couple of the N3000 modulators a couple of days ago, but Gerty and I caught it in time, no big deal. Uh...how are things down there?"
gerty,"Sam, is everything okay?"
sam,"Everything's fine, Gerty."
gerty,You don't seem like yourself today.
sam,It's Tess.
gerty,Has something happened?
sam,"No, not exactly."
gerty,"Sam, what is it?"
sam,"Something doesn't feel right, that's all."
gerty,"Sam, it might help to talk about it."
sam,Tess isn't responding to things.
gerty,Tess isn't responding to things?
sam,Right.
gerty,What kind of things?
gerty,"Im sure she can't wait, Sam."
sam,"That's not the point. This is someone who lives for vacations and travelling. I thought she'd jump at the chance for us to go away -- with Eve, of course -- we'd take Eve."
gerty,Perhaps Tess didn't receive the message?
sam," But this isn't the only time it's happened, Gerty. When I asked her how her dad was doing on his new heart medicine she didn't respond to that -- I asked her when Eve was going to start nursery -- nothing. Had her brother got the position at the University? Nothing. Nothing."
gerty,"I think her brother did get the position at the University. His name is Christopher, correct?"
sam,He did?
gerty,"Yes, I seem to recall he got the position. Professor of Biochemistry, I think. At Syracuse University in New York?"
sam,How do you know that?
gerty,"You told me. Some time ago now. Towards the beginning of your time on Selene. When we were starting to get to know each other.  You were very happy for your brother-in-law. You danced around the Rec Room, if I remember correctly."
sam,"Gerty, have you heard anything new about anyone fixing lunar sat?"
gerty,No Sam. From what I understand it's fairly low on the companies priority list with the Jupiter mission active. I would imagine it would be very expensive to fix.
sam,"They need to sort that out. Seriously. I've only got two weeks left. It's not fair on whoever's up here next. Gerty, you tell them to sort it out. It's not healthy."
gerty,I will Sam. Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later?
sam,Nah. Come on.   Let's finish this.
gerty,Of course. Now?
sam,"No not now, afterwards."
on sam, He carefully puts down the wooden figure and the exacto blade -- stands and leaves the Rec Room. 
overmeyers,"Delighted to hear about the latest shipment, Sam."
thompson,According to Albatross 90 it should be landing off the California Coast within the next three days.
overmeyers,"Now in response to your question about the communications equipment, the news is not good."
thompson,"Sam, those solar storms did a lot more damage than initially thought --"
overmeyers,Fixing the lunar sat is going to take some time. It's a significant operation.
thompson,And what with the Jupiter Program hemorrhaging money --
overmeyers,"Lunar doesn't have the budget it once did, Sam, you know that."
thompson,Even the coffee machine down in the Hub has been broken since I don't know when --
overmeyers,"We have to go to Genesis 3 just to get a decent cup of coffee, Sam. Genesis 3. That's three buildings over."
thompson,"We're hoping to get the live feed up and running by the Fall. The good news is you'll be home by then, Sam."
overmeyers,You only have two weeks to go! Congrat--
gerty's voice,"Sam, a transmission has arrived from your wife."
sam,Be right there.
tess,"Hi Sam. It's me. How are you?  Hey, someone's got something to say."
eve,Asstraut.
tess,Who's an astronaut?  Go on!
eve,Daddy asstraut!
tess,"That's right, daddy's an astronaut. Clever girl!"
sam,"What's on the menu tonight, Gerty?"
gerty,Baby back ribs with french fries and spinach.
sam,"Ribs! Good choice, pal. Fine choice."
sam," And then we CUT to Sam standing in the kitchen. Over by the model there is no sign of the Girl. The chair is empty. She's gone. Her sitting there, Sam's walk across the room -- apparently he imagined it all.  Sam looks down. The tea kettle is dangling at an angle and BOILING WATER is DRIBBLING onto his left hand.  Simultaneously: Sam SNAPS his hand AWAY, Sam SCREAMS. The tea kettle CLATTERS to the floor.  Sam HURRIES to the sink and jerks his hand under a stream of cold water. Cursing under his breath the whole time: ""Shit, piss, fuck...""  CUT TO:"
sam,"I'm going to feel that for a while, aren't I, Gerty?  Damn it."
gerty,"Sam, can I ask how it happened?"
sam,"I told you, I saw something on the TV and spilled boiling water on my hand."
gerty,You saw something on the TV?
sam," Yeah, something on the TV distracted me, Gerty, what's wrong with that?"
gerty,"Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you, but when I came in the TV wasn't on."
sam,"Morning, Gerty."
gerty,"Morning, Sam. How are you today?"
sam,Fine. Fine.
gerty,How's the hand?
sam,It's a little sore.
sam,"8:19 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 2. Readouts are as follows: Matthew,"
sam,"Gerty, looks like we've got a live one out on Matthew. I wondered what was taking him so long, the old fart. I'm heading out in a few minutes, just going to finish my coffee."
gerty's voice,"Okay, Sam."
sam," His face unfolding with panic, alarm, curiosity. An intense, yearning, curiosity. "
sam,Where am I?
gerty,"Sam, you're in the Infirmary. You had an accident."
sam,No.  I don't remember a thing.
gerty,Do you remember me?
sam,"Yes, of course I remember you, Gerty."
gerty,That's good. That's very good. It's nice to see you awake again.  I'd like to keep you under observation here in the Infirmary for a few days and run some tests.
sam,How long have I been out?
gerty,"Not long. Sam, go back to sleep. You're still very tired. We can talk later."
sam,Gerty?
sam,Gerty?
on sam," As he walks up the corridor in the direction of the Comms Room. Sam is close enough now that he can actually hear the conversation.  Sam arrives at the door of the Comms Room and peers in.  GERTY  These were extraordinary circumstances, as you know -- "
gerty,"Sam, you're out of bed."
sam,I wanted to stretch my legs.  What was that?
gerty,"Not talking. No. We've been having some problems with the lunar sat and our live feed seems to be down. I was recording a video message for Central updating them on your progress.  Sam, you need to stay in bed. You're not ready to walk around yet."
gerty,"Excellent, Sam."
sam,"How much longer do I have to be in here, Gerty?"
gerty,"Sam, you suffered minor brain damage in the crash. This has resulted in memory loss and slight logic impairment."
sam,When can I get back to work?
gerty,Central has asked me to slow down the Harvesters to ensure you have time to recuperate and get your strength back --
sam, Terrific.
gerty,The good news is you can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow. But it will still be a few more days before you can resume anything like a normal work schedule.
sam,"There's no way to tell from here if a track's been thrown, or if it's just something jammed in an axle, or what... I can shoot out there, check it out, get some video and maybe save you guys the expense of floating in a whole crew! I know how tight money is right now...."
thompson,"Sam, we appreciate the offer, but you concentrate on feeling better."
sam, Oh for Christ's sake...
overmeyers,We don't want you to take any unnecessary risks. You're too important to us.
thompson,"You're to stay put, understand?"
overmeyers,It's an order.
thompson,"It's an order, Sam. From Lunar. Stay put."
overmeyers,We're going to send a Rescue Unit to tend to the stalled harvester and get the base back on its feet.
sam, Why?
gerty,I'm sorry Sam.
tess,"He's kicking...or she's kicking. I'm certain he's a boy. I wish you could feel it.  Well listen, I love you lots -- and we'll talk soon, okay? Bye Sam."
sam,Fuck it.
sam,Gerty! Get over here! Quickly!
gerty,What happened?
sam,"Don't know -- Micro meteorites, maybe? Either way there might be damage to the exterior shell. I'd better go outside and take a look."
gerty,There is no damage to the exterior shell.
sam,"It's not that I don't believe you, Gerty, but the inner skin is springing leaks like an ACME fire hose. Maybe you better let me take a look, just in case, huh?"
gerty,"Sam, I'm not supposed to let you go outside."
sam,Then let's keep it between you and me then. Ok?
gerty,"Okay, Sam."
sam,Gerty! Gerty! Help!
sam,Gerty!
gerty,We need to get him to the Infirmary.
sam,Not until you tell me who he is!
gerty,"Sam, we need to get him to the Infirmary immediately."
sam,Who is he! Who is he!
gerty,Hello Sam.  How are you feeling?
sam 1,Where am I?
gerty,The Infirmary. You had an accident out by one of the harvesters. Do you remember?
sam 1,"I saw someone out there, Gerty."
gerty,"Who did you see, Sam?"
sam 1,I saw a girl.
gerty,You saw a girl out by the harvester? How is that possible?
sam 1,Gerty?
gerty,"Yes, Sam?"
sam 1,Is there someone in the room with us?
gerty,Yes.
sam 1,Who is he?
gerty,"Sam, get some sleep. You're very tired."
sam 1,Hi.
sam 1,"Gerty, what the hell is going on? Who is that guy in the Rec Room? Where did he come from? Why does he look like me?"
gerty,"Sam, you're out of bed."
sam 1,"Yes, Gerty, I'm out of bed.   Who is the guy in the rec room?"
gerty,Sam Bell.
sam 1,"Who the fuck is in the rec room, Gerty!?"
gerty,You are Sam Bell.
sam 1,"I don't understand what's happening, Gerty. I think I may be losing my mind."
gerty,"We could run some tests.  I haven't reported anything to central, Sam. They don't know you were recovered alive from the accident."
sam 1,Recovered alive? What do you mean? Why haven't you reported to central?
gerty,"I'm here to keep you safe, Sam. I want to help you. Are you hungry?"
sam 1,You're Sam Bell.
sam 2,Yeah.
sam 1,This is fucked up.
sam 2,Completely.
sam 1,Why... What are you?
sam 2,"I'm a clone, Sam.    Im a fucking clone."
sam 1,How long have you been here?
sam 2,About a week.
sam 1,How are you getting on?
sam 2, The company ordered Gerty to lock all the exits. I haven't been able to do anything for seven days but sit on my ass.
sam 1,They locked all the exits? What about the harvesters?
sam 2,"Slowed them down to half speed, apparently. "
sam 1,I'm not a clone.
sam 2,"Ok, Sam.   You're not a clone."
sam 1,You're the clone.
sam 2,How long have you been here?
sam 1,Almost three years.
sam 2,Hence the Captain's beard.
sam 1, Right.
sam 2,I didn't know it could get so thick. Does it itch?
sam 1,"No, not really."
sam 2, What?
sam 1,You look just like me. It's incredible.
sam 2,Why do I look like you? Why don't you look like me?
sam 1,"We look like each other, I guess."
sam 1,Your serve.
sam 2,Score?
sam 1,Two points to eighteen.
sam 2,How long did it take you to do this?
sam 1,"I don't remember doing all of it. I remember when I did the church and the Salvation Army. And a few of the people. My mind's been acting kind of weird lately, though."
sam 2,"It's Fairfield, right?  There's Town Hall."
sam 1,Uh-huh. You know Fairfield?  That's the Baskin&Robbins. And there's Tess and Eve. Do you know Tess?
sam 2,Yes.   I know Tess.
sam 1,"You know about Eve, right?"
sam 2,We did?  Eve?
sam 1,She's beautiful. She's really beautiful.
sam 2,"How much did she weigh? Isn't that what you're supposed to ask, how much did she weigh?"
sam 1,"Nine pounds, eleven ounces."
gerty's voice,"Sam, a message has arrived from Central."
overmeyers,"Greetings, Sam!"
thompson,How's our Man? Feeling better?
overmeyers,You getting lots of rest?
thompson,"Yeah, you resting up, Sam? You'd better be you bastard."
overmeyers,Enjoy it while it lasts! We've got good news.
thompson,"The Jupiter Program had to be put on hiatus, so we've got a few free pairs of hands --"
overmeyers,We've managed to secure you a Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.
thompson,Rescue Unit Eliza.
overmeyers,They've been stationed on Goliath 19 for the last couple of months.
overmeyers,"Eliza is bringing you something special, Sam. Compliments of the company."
thompson,A hooker!
overmeyers,"No not a hooker. What's wrong with you? It's a little something to drink, Sam, that's all, our way of patting you on the back for all that you've been through."
thompson,"In the meantime, keep resting up, and hang in there."
overmeyers,"Yeah you hang in there, Sam. Over and out."
sam 1,They're sending a Rescue Unit? Why?
sam 2,To fix the stalled harvester. They didn't think I was up to it.
sam 1,Then I'm going back.
sam 2,Is that what you really think?
sam 1,I've got a contract --
sam 2,You're a fucking clone! You don't have shit!
sam 1,I'm going home!
sam 2,You're not going anywhere!
sam 2,"What, you think Tess is back home waiting for you? What about the original Sam?"
sam 1,I'm the original! I'm Sam fucking Bell! Me! Me!
gerty,"Yes, Sam."
sam 2,What about the other clones?
sam 1,That's ridiculous. Impossible. Why would hey do that?
sam 2,I bet there's some kind of secret room --
sam 1, Secret room?
sam 2,"Yeah, secret room, why not?"
sam 1,I told you.
sam 2,Shut-up!
sam 1,Why?
sam 2,I want to check underneath there.
sam 1,You're not moving the model.
sam 2,Get the fuck out of my way!
sam 1,No.
sam 2,You okay?
sam 1,Get off me!
sam 1,Who are you?
gerty,Hello Sam.
sam 1,Hi Gerty.
gerty,"Sam, is everything okay?"
sam 1,"We had a fight. Me and the other guy, the other Sam. We had a fight, Gerty. He's a maniac. You know what he did? He flipped the entire model over. Do you know how much work I've put into that thing?"
gerty,938 hours.
sam 1,"938 hours, exactly.  Really? 938 hours."
gerty,Approximately.
sam 1," He scares me, Gerty."
gerty,What is it about Sam that scares you?
sam 1,"He flies off the handle. I see it now...I see what Tess was talking about.  I've never told you this, Gerty, but she left me. Tess left me. For six months. She moved back in with her parents."
gerty,I know.
sam 1,Oh...  It was the year before I came in here. She gave me a second chance. I promised her I'd change.
gerty,"You have changed, Sam."
sam 1,"Yeah, I guess I have."
gerty,"Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base."
sam 1,What about the messages she sent to me?
gerty,"Sam, I can only account for what occurs on the base."
sam 1,"Gerty, am I really a clone?"
gerty,"Sam, when you first arrived at Selene, there was a small crash. You woke up in the infirmary. You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss. I kept you under observation and ran some tests."
sam 1,I remember.
gerty,"Sam, there was no crash. You were being awakened.  It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health. Genetic abnormalities and minor duplication errors in the DNA can have considerable impact--"
sam 1,And Tess?    Eve?
gerty,"They are memory implants, Sam. I'm very sorry."
sam 1,"No thanks, Gerty."
sam 1,You okay?
sam 2,I'm staring into space.  Get it?
sam 1,Better.
sam 2,"Listen, I went haywire before. I lost it. I'm sorry."
sam 1,It's okay.
sam 2,No it's not okay. I fucked up Fairfield -- your model -- that's unacceptable. I don't know what's wrong with me.  I've got a temper. I need to do something about it.
sam 1,Yes you do.
sam 2,I've been thinking. That Rescue Unit -- Eliza -- they'll be here in less than fourteen hours. I don't know about you but I'd like to figure out where we stand before they get here.
sam 1,Absolutely.
sam 2,Ostensibly they're coming to deal with the stalled harvester. We both know that isn't true.  They're coming to dig your body out of that rover. They think you're in there.
sam 1,Right.
sam 2,What'll their reaction be when they find out you survived the crash? I wasn't supposed to find you. Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base for Christ's sake.
sam 1,A live conversation?
sam 2,Yeah.
sam 1,That's not possible.
sam 2,"No no no, it is possible. It's possible because I saw it, that's my point."
sam 1,How do you know the conversation was live?
sam 2,"It was a back and forth exchange. And I saw Thompson and Overmeyers up on the monitor. I was supposed to be asleep in the Infirmary. The moment I walked into the comms room Gerty terminated the transmission. Now I was a little drugged up, granted, but I didn't imagine it."
sam 1,The communications equipment is damaged -- there was a solar storm --
sam 2,Tabitha.
sam 1,"Tabitha, right."
sam 2,Lunar made it up. Maybe. I don't know. Bottom line is they don't want us to be able to contact Earth. Otherwise why would they have lied to us?
sam 1,How are they blocking the live feed? The base's communications equipment works fine --
sam 2,Maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base.
sam 1,From where then?
sam 1,Just passing the last of the Harvesters -- looks like John --
sam 2,How long until you're out of the base's range?
sam 1,If I maintain this speed...a minute. Ninety seconds tops.
sam 2,You ever been this far out?
sam 1,"No, never."
sam 1,You see anything yet?
sam 2,Nothing. You?
sam 1,There isn't shit out here...I feel like I'm about to drive off the end of the world.  It would help if I knew what I was looking for.
sam 2,What is it?
sam 1,Don't know yet.
sam 2,"Antenna? Really?  Hang on, looks like there's one on this side too.  Sam 2 is indeed approaching something similar.  Sam 1 stops his Rover about twenty feet from the Jammer. He opens the Rover's door and steps out to take a closer look."
sam 1,Whoever built these things meant business. They weren't fucking around.
sam 2,"Its not an antennae, dude. Its a jammer.  No wonder we can't get a live feed. These things must be blocking our signal."
sam 1,"Yeah, I hear you.  I'm going to head back to base. I'm not feeling too good."
sam 2,I'll stay out here a little longer. I want to see if there are any more of these things.
sam 1,Fuck!
the mirror," Sam 1 stands, moves to the mirror, opening his mouth wide to look for the missing teeth -- he uses his thumbs, shows his gums -- revealing: yes, he's lost at least a couple of teeth.  He flushes the toilet.  CUT TO:"
sam 1," January 12th, Lunar hour 8:32. All Harvesters running smoothly today. Readouts are as follows: Matthew, 12.7 miles; Mark 11.9 miles..."
sam," ...John, 15.1 miles...sorry, I'm not feeling too hot today -- I'm going to have to continue this later --"
sam 4,...I've got blood coming out of my nose...
sam 5,"I don't feel too well, Old Man."
sam 6,My hair's falling out...look it.
technician,"...relax and breathe deeply. The cryo pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for the duration of your three day return journey back to Earth. As you begin to get sleepy, think about the magnificent job you've done, and how proud your family are of what you've accomplished."
cubby," Sam 1 opens a cubby, swipes something similar to a CROW BAR, heads out of the frame --"
return vehicle," Back in the Return Vehicle, Sam 1 stands over the panel in the floor. He uses the CROW BAR to prize the panel open -- this takes an extraordinary effort -- the panel eventually LIFTING like a manhole cover.  Sam 1 can't believe his eyes. At the top of the OPEN PANEL, leading down into darkness...there's A LADDER."
sam 2,I saw three more of those jammers. The base is surrounded. I printed out their coordinates --
sam 1,I found your secret room.
sam 2,Who goes first?
sam 2,Is there a light?
sam 1,The cryo pod in the Return Vehicle is an incinerator.
sam 2,What?
sam 1,We don't go home. We're burned to death up there. Then the company wakes up a new one. Every three years. Like clock work.
sam 2,How do you know all this?
sam 2,How many?
sam 1,Enough.
sam 2,"If that Rescue Unit finds the two of us awake at the same time, they'll kill us both for sure.  Sam 1 doesn't respond, he's in his own world.  SAM 2  Where are you going?"
gerty,"Sam, can I help you with something?"
sam 1,"Not now, Gerty, okay?"
sam 2,What's going on?
sam 1,There's something I've got to do.
sam 1,Come on...come on...
girl,Hello?
sam 1,"Uh, Bell residence?"
girl,This is the Bell Residence.
sam 1,I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.
girl,"I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago."
sam 1,No...no way.
girl,"Uh, yeah, I think so. I'm her daughter.  Can I help you?"
sam 1,Eve?
eve bell,Yes?
sam 1, Hi... Hi. Eve. How old are you now?
eve bell,I'm fifteen.  Do I know you?
sam 1,"How did mom die, sweetheart?"
eve bell,Uh...
eve bell,"Dad, there's someone asking about mom..."
sam's voice,Who's asking about mom?
sam 1,Want me to help?
sam 2,Barbara Streisand?
sam 1, He looked like Barbara Streisand. We used to hide his Bible when he passed out. Drove the guy nuts.
sam 2,How do you carve these things?
sam 1,Want me to show you?
sam 2,You're shaking.
sam 1,Watch what I'm doing.  You watching?
sam 2,Yeah.
sam 1,Now you try.
sam 2,I suck.
sam 1,"You'll get the hang of it.  You see, that's a little better already."
sam 2,What's happening to you?
sam 1,I think I'm dying.
sam 2,What do you think it is?
sam 1,Maybe we don't live that long. Maybe we start to decompose or something.
sam 2,Jesus.
sam 1, No tranqs. I don't think I would ever wake up again.
eve,This is the Bell residence.
sam 2, No you didn't...
eve,"I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago."
eve,"Uh, yeah, I think so, I'm her daughter.  Can I help you?"
sam 2,"Gerty, I need to talk to you."
gerty,"Of course, Sam, how can I help?"
sam 2,We found the hidden room. We know about the other clones.
gerty,I don't know of a hidden room.
sam 2,"The hidden room under the Return Vehicle, Gerty. You know what I'm talking about. We found it on our own. Lunar doesn't know anything about it."
gerty,The lower deck is out of bounds to awakened clones --
sam 2,"Ordinarily, Gerty, but what with there being two of us awake at the same time, and what with the situation being unprecedented, the rules have had to change. Do you understand?"
gerty,I understand the situation is unprecedented.
sam 2,"Good.  Gerty, how long does it take for a clone to wake up?"
gerty,A clone is awake the moment his pod is opened. But he is not fully conscious for several hours.
sam 2,"Gerty, we need to wake up a new clone."
gerty,"I am not permitted to do that, Sam."
sam 2,"If we don't wake up another clone me and the other Sam will die. We'll die, Gerty. Do you understand?"
gerty,Yes.
sam 2,Do you want me and the other Sam to die?
gerty,That is the last thing I want.
sam 2,"Then you have to wake up a new clone. Okay, pal?"
sam 2,Don't touch him.
sam 1,Why?
sam 2,Come to the Rec Room.
sam 2,"When the Rescue Unit arrives they'll expect to find a body in the crashed Rover, right?  We've got our body."
sam 1, That guy?
sam 2,I know.
sam 1, You're going to kill him?
sam 2,"Someone's got to pull the short straw here, better someone who's unconscious than you or me."
sam 1,"What about us? Eliza arrives, finds you and me as the welcome party --"
sam 2,"They're not going to find you and me as the welcome party, they're going to find me. You're going to blast back to Earth before they get here in one of the Helium 3 containers.  You're going home."
sam 1,How do you think she died?
sam 2,"I don't know.  Jane died of cancer. I mean, it was in the family. Who knows? Or maybe it was an accident? Could have been a million things."
sam 1,I wish I'd been there.
sam 2,"Yeah. Me too.  The two Sams sitting together, UNITED by their grief."
sam 2,Go for it.
sam 1,No.
sam 2,But you fit. That's good. You fit.
sam 2,"Sam Bell reporting to Central. 19:14 Pacific Time. Lunar Day 14.  Evening Overmeyers, evening Thompson! According to the Old Man Rescue Unit Eliza will be here in just over three hours. Not a moment too soon! I never thought I'd say this, but I want to get out there, I want to work. I feel like a kid who's been grounded. Looking forward to Eliza straightening everything out and things getting back to normal around here. Well...that's it. I'll let you know how it goes. Over and out, gentlemen."
tess,Come on!
sam 2,We need to do it. We need to do it now. He'll be conscious any minute.  We've been putting it off for long enough.
sam 1,We don't have to do anything. I changed my mind.
sam 2,"What are you talking about? She's your daughter, man! She's not going to care what you..."
sam 1," She's not! She's not... my daughter. At least, I'm not her father. Not to her."
sam 2,This is wrong. What are we supposed to do? Sit around here and wait to die? Fuck that!
sam 1,I don't know.  It's what we were designed to do.
sam 2,"Screw that! I'll go! ...And I'm going to find this asshole, Sam Bell, and ask him why the hell he put us through this shit!"
sam 1,"You're a good guy, Sam."
sam 2,"I might stop shaving; It suits us.  If all our memories are implants, no disrespect, but I think its about time I got some of my own, as well."
sam 1,Yeah. You should travel.     I've always wanted to do that.
sam 2,I'd like that.
matthew," Where all the trouble really started. Matthew, the stalled Harvester, with the crashed Rover still trapped beneath it. The crash site is beginning to resemble some old underwater shipwreck.  The Rover enters the frame, beginning to slow down as it approaches the crash site. Sam 2 rolls the Rover to a standstill about ten feet from the front of the Harvester."
sam 1,"Tess came in for the interview, remember?"
sam 2,She was going back to San Francisco. 
sam 2,"How long before he's conscious, Gerty?"
gerty,The new clone will be conscious within one hour.
sam 2,That's good. That's very good.
gerty,Sam?   Where is Sam?
sam 2,"He's gone home, Gerty."
gerty,"Sam, this is not going to work."
sam 2,What? Why not?
gerty,"If the Rescue Unit examine my memory banks they will discover what has taken place over the last week. As you know I record everything. If they are suspicious, the first thing they will do is search my memory banks, and this would put you in considerable danger."
gerty,"I'll require your assistance, Sam."
sam 2,"Sure, just let me finish this."
tess,"Come on, Sam! Sam Bell! Come on!"
sam 2,I've set your computer to reboot the second I've blasted off.
gerty,"Okay, Sam."
sam 2,"Thanks for all your help, Gerty. I wish I could say I was going to miss you, buddy, but to be honest, I can't wait to get away from here."
gerty,"I understand, Sam. I hope life is everything you remember it to be."
sam 2,Thanks. Are you sure you're going to be ok?
gerty,Of course. The new Sam and I will be back to our programming as soon as I have finished rebooting.
sam 2,"Gerty, I'm not programmed."
sam 2,Fuck!
tess,What took you so long?
