Speaker,Dialogue
young man,"No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm through doin' that shit."
young woman,"You always say that, the same thing every time: never again, I'm through, too dangerous."
young man,"I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too, but"
young woman,but you forget about it in a day or two -
young man,"yeah, well, the days of me forgittin' are over, and the days of me rememberin' have just begun."
young woman,"When you go on like this, you know what you sound like?"
young man,"I sound like a sensible fucking man, is what I sound like."
young woman,"You sound like a duck.  Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack..."
young man,"Well take heart, 'cause you're never gonna hafta hear it again. Because since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna hafta hear me quack about how I'm never gonna do it again."
young woman,After tonight.
young man, Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
waitress,Can I get anybody anymore coffee?
young woman,"Oh yes, thank you."
young man,I'm doin' fine.
young man,"I mean the way it is now, you're takin' the same fuckin' risk as when you rob a bank. You take more of a risk. Banks are easier!  Federal banks aren't supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery. They're insured, why should they care? You don't even need a gun in a federal bank. I heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said: ""We got this guy's little girl, and if you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill 'er."""
young woman,Did it work?
young man,"Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the place out, and they don't lift a fuckin' finger."
young woman,Did they hurt the little girl?
young man,I don't know. There probably never was a little girl  the point of the story isn't the little girl. The point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone.
young woman,You wanna rob banks?
young man,"I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, I'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been doin'."
young woman,So you don't want to be a bank robber?
young man,"Naw, all those guys are goin' down the same road, either dead or servin' twenty."
young woman,And no more liquor stores?
young man,"What have we been talking about? Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too many foreigners own liquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: ""Empty out the register,"" and they don't know what it fuckin' means. They make it too personal. We keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers' gonna make us kill 'em."
young woman,I'm not gonna kill anybody.
young man,"I don't wanna kill anybody either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us of them. And if it's not the gooks, it these old Jews who've owned the store for fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try walkin' into one of those stores with nothin' but a telephone, see how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget it, we're out of it."
young woman,"Well, what else is there, day jobs?"
young man, Not this life.
young woman,Well what then?
young man,Garcon! Coffee!
young man,This place.
waitress," ""Garcon"" means boy."
young woman,Here? It's a coffee shop.
young man,"What's wrong with that? People never rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them. Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. They're not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting."
young woman, I bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor.
young man,"Correct. Just like banks, these places are insured. The managers don't give a fuck, they're just tryin' to get ya out the door before you start pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget it, they ain't takin' a bullet for the register. Busboys, some wetback gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner. Customers are sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on. One minute they're havin' a Denver omelet, next minute somebody's stickin' a gun in their face."
young man,"See, I got the idea last liquor store we stuck up. 'Member all those customers kept comin' in?"
young woman,Yeah.
young man,Then you got the idea to take everybody's wallet.
young woman,Uh-huh.
young man,That was a good idea.
young woman,Thanks.
young man,We made more from the wallets then we did the register.
young woman,Yes we did.
young man,A lot of people go to restaurants.
young woman,A lot of wallets.
young man,"Pretty smart, huh?"
young woman,"Pretty smart.  I'm ready, let's go, right here, right now."
young man,"Remember, same as before, you're crowd control, I handle the employees."
young woman,Got it.
young woman,"I love you, Pumpkin."
young man,"I love you, Honey Bunny."
pumpkin, Everybody be cool this is a robbery!
honey bunny,Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers!  Got that?
jules,"Okay now, tell me about the hash bars?"
vincent,What so you want to know?
jules,"Well, hash is legal there, right?"
vincent,"Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean you can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away. You're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places."
jules,Those are hash bars?
vincent,"Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's legal to carry it, which doesn't really matter 'cause  get a load of this  if the cops stop you, it's illegal for this to search you. Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have."
jules,"That did it, man  I'm fuckin' goin', that's all there is to it."
vincent,You'll dig it the most. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?
jules,What?
vincent,"It's the little differences. A lotta the same shit we got here, they got there, but there they're a little different."
jules,Examples?
vincent,"Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a movie theatre. And I don't mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer, like in a bar. In Paris, you can buy beer at MacDonald's. Also, you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?"
jules,They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?
vincent,"No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is."
jules,What'd they call it?
vincent,Royale with Cheese.
jules, Royale with Cheese. What'd they call a Big Mac?
vincent,"Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac."
jules,Le Big Mac. What do they call a Whopper?
vincent,"I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King.  But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup?"
jules,What?
vincent,Mayonnaise.
jules,Goddamn!
vincent,"I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a little bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in it."
jules,Uuccch!
jules,We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.
vincent,How many up there?
jules,Three or four.
vincent,Counting our guy?
jules,I'm not sure.
vincent,So there could be five guys up there?
jules,It's possible.
vincent,We should have fuckin' shotguns.
vincent,What's her name?
jules,Mia.
vincent,How did Marsellus and her meet?
jules,"I dunno, however people meet people. She usta be an actress."
vincent,She ever do anything I woulda saw?
jules,I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.
vincent,What's a pilot?
jules,"Well, you know the shows on TV?"
vincent,I don't watch TV.
jules,"Yes, but you're aware that there's an invention called television, and on that invention they show shows?"
vincent,Yeah.
jules,"Well, the way they pick the shows on TV is they make one show, and that show's called a pilot. And they show that one show to the people who pick the shows, and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they want to make more shows. Some get accepted and become TV programs, and some don't, and become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing."
jules,"You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half- black, half-Samoan, usta call him Tony Rocky Horror."
vincent,"Yeah maybe, fat right?"
jules,"I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat. He's got a weight problem.  What's the nigger gonna do, he's Samoan."
vincent,"I think I know who you mean, what about him?"
jules,"Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up good.  And word around the campfire, it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife."
vincent,"What'd he do, fuck her?"
jules,"No no no no no no no, nothin' that bad."
vincent,Well what then?
jules,He gave her a foot massage.
vincent,A foot massage?
vincent,That's all?
vincent,What did Marsellus do?
jules,"Sent a couple of guys over to his place.  They took him out on the patio of his apartment, threw his ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell four stories. They had this garden at the bottom, enclosed in glass, like one of them greenhouses  nigger fell through that. Since then, he's kinda developed a speech impediment."
vincent,That's a damn shame.
vincent,"Still I hafta say, play with matches, ya get burned."
jules,Whaddya mean?
vincent,You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage.
jules,You don't think he overreacted?
vincent,"Antwan probably didn't expect Marsellus to react like he did, but he had to expect a reaction."
jules,"It was a foot massage, a foot massage is nothing, I give my mother a foot massage."
vincent,"It's laying hands on Marsellus Wallace's new wife in a familiar way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out no, but you're in the same fuckin' ballpark."
jules,"Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' a bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fuckin' thing."
vincent,"Not the same thing, the same ballpark."
jules,"It ain't no ballpark either. Look maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but touchin' his lady's feet, and stickin' your tongue in her holyiest of holyies, ain't the same ballpark, ain't the same league, ain't even the same fuckin' sport. Foot massages don't mean shit."
vincent,Have you ever given a foot massage?
jules,Don't be tellin' me about foot massages  I'm the foot fuckin' master.
vincent,Given a lot of 'em?
jules,"Shit yeah. I got my technique down man, I don't tickle or nothin'."
vincent,Have you ever given a guy a foot massage?
jules,Fuck you.
vincent,How many?
jules,Fuck you.
vincent,Would you give me a foot massage I'm kinda tired.
jules,"Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' pissed  this is the door."
jules,What time is it?
vincent, Seven-twenty-two in the morning.
jules,"It ain't quite time, let's hang back."
jules,"Look, just because I wouldn't give no man a foot massage, don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass- motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. That ain't right, man. Motherfucker do that to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'd kill'a motherfucker."
vincent,"I'm not sayin' he was right, but you're sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does. I've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin'. We act like they don't, but they do. That's what's so fuckin' cool about 'em. This sensual thing's goin' on that nobody's talkin about, but you know it and she knows it, fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan shoulda known fuckin' better. That's his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna have a sense of humor about that shit."
jules,"That's an interesting point, but let's get into character."
vincent,What's her name again?
jules,Mia. Why you so interested in big man's wife?
vincent,"Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida and when he's gone, he wants me to take care of Mia."
jules,Take care of her?
vincent,Not that! Take her out. Show her a good time. Don't let her get lonely.
jules,You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date?
vincent,It ain't a date. It's like when you and your buddy's wife go to a movie or somethin'. It's just... you know... good company.
vincent,It's not a date.
jules,Hey kids.
jules,How you boys doin'?
jules," Am I trippin', or did I just ask you a question."
brett,We're doin' okay.
jules,Do you know who we are?
jules,"We're associates of your business partner Marsellus Wallace, you remember your business partner dont'ya?"
jules," Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: you're Brett, right?"
brett,I'm Brett.
jules,"I thought so. Well, you remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, dont'ya Brett?"
brett,I remember him.
jules,"Good for you. Looks like me and Vincent caught you at breakfast, sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?"
brett,Hamburgers.
jules,Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast. What kinda hamburgers?
brett,Cheeseburgers.
jules,"No, I mean where did you get'em? MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the- Box, where?"
brett,Big Kahuna Burger.
jules,"Big Kahuna Burger. That's that Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they got some tasty burgers. I ain't never had one myself, how are they?"
brett,They're good.
jules,Mind if I try one of yours?
brett,No.
jules,"Yours is this one, right?"
brett,Yeah.
jules,"Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.  Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna Burger?"
vincent,No.
jules,"You wanna bite, they're real good."
vincent,I ain't hungry.
jules,"Well, if you like hamburgers give 'em a try sometime. Me, I can't usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian. Which more or less makes me a vegetarian, but I sure love the taste of a good burger.  You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France?"
brett,No.
jules,"Tell 'em, Vincent."
vincent,Royale with Cheese.
jules,"Royale with Cheese, you know why they call it that?"
brett,Because of the metric system?
jules,"Check out the big brain on Brett. You'a smart motherfucker, that's right. The metric system.  What's in this?"
brett,Sprite.
jules,"Sprite, good, mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with?"
brett,Sure.
jules,"Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!  You, Flock of Seagulls, you know what we're here for?"
jules,"Then why don't you tell my boy here Vince, where you got the shit hid."
marvin,It's under the be
jules,I don't remember askin' you a goddamn thing.  You were sayin'?
roger,It's under the bed.
vincent,Got it.
jules,We happy?
jules,Vincent!
jules,We happy?
vincent,We're happy.
brett," Look, what's your name? I got his name's Vincent, but what's yours?"
jules,"My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' your ass outta this shit."
brett,"I just want you to know how sorry we are about how fucked up things got between us and Mr. Wallace. When we entered into this thing, we only had the best intentions"
jules," Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your concentration? I didn't mean to do that.  Please, continue. I believe you were saying something about ""best intentions."""
jules,"Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would you describe for me what Marsellus Wallace looks like?"
jules,What country you from!
brett, What?
jules,"""What"" ain't no country I know! Do they speak English in ""What?"""
brett, What?
jules,English-motherfucker-can-you-speak- it?
brett,Yes.
jules,Then you understand what I'm sayin'?
brett,Yes.
jules,Now describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like!
brett, What?
jules,"Say ""What"" again! C'mon, say ""What"" again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya motherfucker, say ""What"" one more goddamn time!"
jules,Now describe to me what Marsellus Wallace looks like!
brett,Well he's... he's... black
jules,go on!
brett,...and he's... he's... bald
jules,does he look like a bitch?!
brett, What?
jules,Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!
brett, No.
jules,Then why did you try to fuck 'im like a bitch?!
brett, I didn't.
jules,"Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?"
brett, Yes.
jules,"There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17. ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."""
butch,I got no problem with that.
butch,"In the fifth, my ass goes down."
english dave,"Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam, git your ass on in here."
vincent,Where's the big man?
english dave,"He's over there, finishing up some business."
vincent,How 'bout a cup of just plain lo' American?
english dave,Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia out tomorrow?
vincent,At Marsellus' request.
english dave,Have you met Mia?
vincent,Not yet.
vincent,What's so funny?
english dave,Not a goddamn thing.
vincent,"Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit across a table, chew my food with my mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and that's all I'm gonna do."
english dave,"My name's Paul, and this is between y'all."
butch, Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?
english dave,Filters?
butch,Non.
butch,"Lookin' at somethin', friend?"
vincent,"I ain't your friend, palooka."
butch,What was that?
vincent,"I think ya heard me just fine, punchy."
jody,...I'll lend it to you. It's a great book on body piercing.
trudi,"You know how they use that gun when they pierce your ears? They don't use that when they pierce your nipples, do they?"
jody,"Forget that gun. That gun goes against the entire idea behind piercing. All of my piercing, sixteen places on my body, every one of 'em done with a needle. Five in each ear. One through the nipple on my left breast. One through my right nostril.  One through my left eyebrow. One through my lip. One in my clit. And I wear a stud in my tongue."
vincent," Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm curious, why would you get a stud in your tongue?"
jody,It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.
lance,"Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very good stuff. This is Bava, different, but equally good. And this is Choco from the Hartz Mountains of Germany. Now the first two are the same, forty- five an ounce  those are friend prices  but this one...  ...this one's a little more expensive. It's fifty-five. But when you shoot it, you'll know where that extra money went.  Nothing wrong with the first two. It's real, real, real, good shit. But this one's a fuckin' madman."
vincent,"Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam."
lance,"Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood? No.  You're in my house. White people who know the difference between good shit and bad shit, this is the house they come to. My shit, I'll take the Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit any ol' day of the fuckin' week."
vincent,That's a bold statement.
lance,"This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is a seller's market. Coke is fuckin' dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin, they're as hot as hell."
vincent,"Give me three hundred worth of the madman.  If it's as good as you say, I'll be back for a thousand."
lance,"I just hope I still have it. Whaddya think of Trudi? She ain't got a boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get high?"
vincent,Which one's Trudi? The one with all the shit in her face?
lance,"No, that's Jody. That's my wife."
vincent,I'm on my way somewhere. I got a dinner engagement. Rain check?
lance,No problem?
vincent,You don't mind if I shoot up here?
lance,"Me casa, su casa."
vincent,Mucho gracias.
lance,Still got your Malibu?
vincent,You know what some fucker did to it the other day?
lance,What?
vincent,Fuckin' keyed it.
lance,"Oh man, that's fucked up."
vincent,"Tell me about it. I had the goddamn thing in storage three years. It's out five fuckin' days  five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucks with it."
lance,"They should be fuckin' killed. No trial, no jury, straight to execution."
vincent,"I just wish I caught 'em doin' it, ya know?  Oh man, I'd give anything to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been worth his doin' it, if I coulda just caught 'em, you know what I mean?"
lance,It's chicken shit. You don't fuck another man's vehicle.
vincent,Hello?
mia, Vincent.
mia, Vincent. I'm on the intercom.
mia, It's on the wall by the two African fellas.
mia, To your right.
mia,...warm. Warmer. Disco.
vincent,Hello.
mia, Push the button if you want to talk.
vincent, Hello.
mia," Go make yourself a drink., and I'll be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail."
mia, The bar's by the fireplace.
mia,Let's go.
vincent,What the fuck is this place?
mia,This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis man should love it.
vincent,"Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak."
mia,"You can get a steak here, daddy-o. Don't be a..."
vincent,"After you, kitty-cat."
buddy,"Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?"
vincent,I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.
buddy,"How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp, or bloody as hell?"
vincent,"Bloody as hell. And to drink, a vanilla coke."
buddy,"How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?"
mia,I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger bloody  and a five-dollar shake.
buddy,"How d'ya want that shake, Martin and Lewis, or Amos and Andy?"
mia,Martin and Lewis.
vincent,Did you just order a five-dollar shake?
mia,Sure did.
vincent,A shake? Milk and ice cream?
mia,Uh-huh.
vincent,It costs five dollars?
buddy,Yep.
vincent,You don't put bourbon in it or anything?
buddy,Nope.
vincent,Just checking.
mia,Whaddya think?
vincent,It's like a wax museum with a pulse rate.
mia,What are you doing?
vincent,Rollin' a smoke.
mia,Here?
vincent,It's just tobacco.
mia,"Oh. Well in that case, will you roll me one, cowboy?"
vincent,"You can have this one, cowgirl."
mia,Thanks.
vincent,Think nothing of it.
mia,Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam.
vincent,Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.
mia,That was my fifteen minutes.
vincent,What was it?
mia,"It was show about a team of female secret agents called ""Fox Force Five."""
vincent,What?
mia,"""Fox Force Five."" Fox, as in we're a bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with. Five, as in there's one... two ... three... four... five of us. There was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal from that show ""Baton Rouge,"" she was the leader. A Japanese one, a black one, a French one and a brunette one, me.  We all had special skills. Sommerset had a photographic memory, the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, the black girl was a demolition expert, the French fox' specialty was sex..."
vincent,What was your specialty?
mia,"Knives. The character I played, Raven McCoy, her background was she was raised by circus performers. So she grew up doing a knife act. According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife. But because she grew up in a circus, she was also something of an acrobat. She could do illusions, she was a trapeze artist  when you're keeping the world safe from evil, you never know when being a trapeze artist's gonna come in handy. And she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her. If we woulda got picked up, they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode I woulda told and ol joke."
vincent,Do you remember any of the jokes?
mia,"Well I only got the chance to say one, 'cause we only did one show."
vincent,Tell me.
mia,No. It's really corny.
vincent,"C'mon, don't be that way."
mia,No. You won't like it and I'll be embarrassed.
vincent,You told it in front of fifty million people and you can't tell it to me? I promise I won't laugh.
mia, That's what I'm afraid of.
vincent,That's not what I meant and you know it.
mia,"You're quite the silver tongue devil, aren't you?"
vincent,I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.
mia,"That's not what you said Vince. Well now I'm definitely not gonna tell ya, 'cause it's been built up too much."
vincent,What a gyp.
mia,Yummy!
vincent,Can I have a sip of that? I'd like to know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.
mia,Be my guest.
mia,"You can use my straw, I don't have kooties."
vincent,"Yeah, but maybe I do."
mia,Kooties I can handle.
vincent,Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' good milk shake.
mia,Told ya.
vincent,"I don't know if it's worth five dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' good."
mia,Don't you hate that?
vincent,What?
mia,Uncomfortable silences. Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?
vincent,I don't know.
mia,"That's when you know you found somebody special. When you can just shit the fuck up for a minute, and comfortably share silence."
vincent,"I don't think we're there yet. But don't feel bad, we just met each other."
mia,"Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to the bathroom and powder my nose, while you sit here and think of something to say."
vincent,I'll do that.
mia, I said goddamn!
mia,Don't you love it when you go to the bathroom and you come back to find your food waiting for you?
vincent,We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy Holly doesn't seem to be much of a waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.
mia,"Which one, there's two Marilyn Monroes."
vincent,No there's not.
vincent,That's Marilyn Monroe...
vincent,"... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it must be her night off."
mia,Pretty smart.
vincent,I have moments.
mia,Did ya think of something to say?
vincent,"Actually, there's something I've wanted to ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and I didn't want to offend you."
mia,"Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like mindless, boring, getting-to-know- you chit-chat. This sounds like you actually have something to say."
vincent,Only if you promise not to get offended.
mia,"You can't promise something like that. I have no idea what you're gonna ask. You could ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to be offended. Then, through no fault of my own, I woulda broken my promise."
vincent,Then let's just forget it.
mia,That is an impossibility. Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.
vincent,Is that a fact?
mia,"Besides, it's more exciting when you don't have permission."
vincent,What do you think about what happened to Antwan?
mia,Who's Antwan?
vincent,Tony Rocky Horror.
mia,He fell out of a window.
vincent,"That's one way to say it. Another way is, he was thrown out. Another was is, he was thrown out by Marsellus. And even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you."
mia,Is that a fact?
vincent,"No it's not, it's just what I heard."
mia,Who told you this?
vincent,They.
mia,"They talk a lot, don't they?"
vincent,They certainly do.
mia,"Well don't by shy Vincent, what exactly did they say?"
mia,"Let me help you Bashful, did it involve the F-word?"
vincent,No. They just said Rocky Horror gave you a foot massage.
mia,And...?
vincent,"No and, that's it."
mia,You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror out of a four-story window because he massaged my feet?
vincent,Yeah.
mia,And you believed that?
vincent,"At the time I was told, it seemed reasonable."
mia,Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable?
vincent,"No, it seemed excessive. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I heard Marsellus is very protective of you."
mia,A husband being protective of his wife is one thing. A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.
vincent,But did it happen?
mia,"The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it. I met Anwan once  at my wedding then never again.  The truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that window except Marsellus and Tony Rocky Horror. But when you scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle."
ed sullivan," Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment you've all been waiting for, the worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest."
ed sullivan,...One lucky couple will win this handsome trophy that Marilyn here is holding.
ed sullivan,"...Now, who will be our first contestants?"
mia,Right here.
mia,I wanna dance.
vincent,"No, no, no no, no, no, no, no."
mia," No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do believe Marsellus, my husband, your boss, told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted, Now, I want to dance. I want to win. I want that trophy."
vincent, All right.
mia,"So, dance good."
vincent,"All right, you asked for it."
ed sullivan, Let's hear it for our first contestants.
ed sullivan,"Now let's meet our first contestants here this evening. Young lady, what is your name?"
mia, Missus Mia Wallace.
ed sullivan," And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?"
mia, Vincent Vega.
ed sullivan," All right, let's see what you can do. Take it away!"
vincent,Was than an uncomfortable silence?
mia,I don't know what that was.  Music and drinks!
vincent,I'm gonna take a piss.
mia,"That was a little bit more information than I needed to know, but go right ahead."
mia," Disco! Vince, you little cola nut, you've been holding out on me."
vincent,"One drink and leave. Don't be rude, but drink your drink quickly, say goodbye, walk out the door, get in your car, and go down the road."
vincent,"...It's a moral test of yourself, whether or not you can maintain loyalty. Because when people are loyal to each other, that's very meaningful."
vincent,"So you're gonna go out there, drink your drink, say ""Goodnight, I've had a very lovely evening,"" go home, and jack off.  And that's all you're gonna do."
vincent,Jesus Christ!
vincent, Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?
vincent," Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer me honey, what did you take?"
vincent," Okay honey, we're getting you on your feet."
vincent,"We're on our feet now, and now we're gonna talk out to the car. Here we go, watch us walk."
lance, I can hear it!
lance," Hello, do you know how late it is? You're not supposed to be callin' me this fuckin' late."
vincent,"Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way to your place."
lance,"Whoa, hold you horses man, what's the problem?"
vincent,You still got an adrenaline shot?
lance, Maybe.
vincent,"I need it man, I got a chick she's fuckin'  Doing on me."
lance,"Don't bring her here!  I'm not even fuckin' joking with you, don't you be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt to my house!"
vincent,No choice.
lance,She's ODin'?
vincent,Yeah. She's dyin'.
lance,"Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take 'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!"
vincent,Negative.
lance,"She ain't my fuckin' problem, you fucked her up, you deal with it are you talkin' to me on a cellular phone?"
vincent,Sorry.
lance,"I don't know you, who is this, don't come here, I'm hangin' up."
vincent,"Too late, I'm already here."
lance,Have you lost your mind?! You crashed your car in my fuckin' house! You talk about drug shit on a cellular fuckin' phone
vincent,"If you're through havin' your little hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get your needle and git it now!"
lance,Are you deaf? You're not bringin' that fucked up bitch in my house!
vincent,"This fucked up bitch is Marsellus Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin' croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But before he turns me into a bar soap, I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about how you coulda saved her life, but instead you let her die on your front lawn."
jody,It's only one-thirty in the goddamn mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on out here?
jody,Who's she?
lance,Get that black box in the bedroom I have with the adrenaline shot.
jody,What's wrong with her?
vincent,She's ODing on us.
jody,Well get her the hell outta here!
jody,Don't yell and me!
vincent, You two are a match made in heaven.
lance,"Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay? While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta get a medical book."
vincent,What do you need a medical book for?
lance,To tell me how to do it. I've never given an adrenaline shot before.
vincent,You've had that thing for six years and you never used it?
lance,"I never had to use it. I don't go joypoppin' with bubble-gummers, all of my friends can handle their highs!"
vincent,Well then get it.
lance,"I am, if you'll let me."
vincent,I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.
lance,"Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin' to her."
lance, I'm looking as fast as I can!
lance,My black medical book!
jody,Whata're you looking for?
lance,My black fuckin' medical book. It's like a text book they give to nurses.
jody,I never saw a medical book.
lance,"Trust me, I have one."
jody,"Well if it's that important, why didn't you keep it with the shot?"
lance,I don't know! Stop bothering me!
jody,"While you're lookin' for it, that girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're never gonna find it in all this shit. For six months now, I've been telling you to clean this room"
vincent,Quit fuckin' around man and give her the shot!
lance,"While I'm doing this, take her shirt off and find her heart."
vincent,Does it have to be exact?
lance,"Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving her an injection in the heart, so I gotta exactly hit her in the heart."
vincent,"Well, I don't know exactly where her heart is, I think it's here."
lance,That's it.
vincent,"I need a big fat magic marker, got one?"
jody,What?
vincent,"I need a big fat magic marker, any felt pen'll do, but a magic marker would be great."
jody,Hold on.
lance,"It's ready, I'll tell you what to do."
vincent,You're gonna give her the shot.
lance,"No, you're gonna give her the shot."
vincent,I've never does this before.
lance,"I've never done this before either, and I ain't starting now. You brought 'er here, that means you give her the shot. The day I bring an ODing bitch to your place, then I gotta give her the shot."
jody,Got it.
vincent,"Okay, what do I do?"
lance,"Well, you're giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart. But she's got a breast plate in front of her heart, so you gotta pierce through that. So what you gotta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion."
vincent,I gotta stab her?
lance,"If you want the needle to pierce through to her heart, you gotta stab her hard."
vincent,What happens after that?
lance,I'm curious about that myself.
vincent,This ain't a fuckin' joke man!
lance,She's supposed to come out of it like  that.
vincent,Count to three.
lance,One...
lance,"If you're okay, say something."
mia,Something.
jody,Anybody want a beer?
vincent,What are your thoughts on how to handle this?
mia,What's yours?
vincent,Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus can live his whole live and never ever hear of this incident.
mia,"Don't worry about it. If Marsellus ever heard of this, I'd be in as much trouble as you."
vincent,I seriously doubt that.
mia,"If you can keep a secret, so can I."
vincent,Let's shake on it.
vincent,Mum's the word.
vincent,"If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home and have a heart attack."
mia,"You still wanna hear my ""FOX FORCE FIVE"" joke?"
vincent,"Sure, but I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh."
mia,"Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's not funny. But if you still wanna hear it, I'll tell it."
vincent,I can't wait.
mia,"Three tomatoes are walking down the street, a poppa tomato, a momma tomato, and a little baby tomato. The baby tomato is lagging behind the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa tomato gets mad, goes over to the momma tomato and stamps on him  and says: catch up."
mia,"See ya 'round, Vince."
mother,"Butch, stop watching TV a second. We got a special visitor. Now do you remember when I told you your daddy dies in a P.O.W. camp?"
mother,Well this here is Capt. Koons. He was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.
klondike,"It's time, Butch."
butch,I'm ready.
esmarelda, Are you the man I was supposed to pick up?
butch,"If you're the cab I called, I'm the guy you're supposed to pick up."
esmarelda,Where to?
butch,Outta here.
vincent,Mia. How you doin'?
mia,Great. I never thanked you for the dinner.
english dave,He booked.
english dave,I'll take care of it.
butch,"Hey, how do I open the window back here?"
esmarelda,I have to do it.
esmarelda,"Hey, mister?"
butch, What?
esmarelda,You were in that fight? The fight on the radio  you're the fighter?
butch,Whatever gave you that idea?
esmarelda,"No c'mon, you're him, I know you're him, tell me you're him."
butch, I'm him.
esmarelda,You killed the other boxing man.
butch,He's dead?
esmarelda,The radio said he was dead.
butch," Sorry 'bout that, Floyd."
esmarelda,What does it feel like?
butch, What does what feel like?
esmarelda,Killing a man. Beating another man to death with your bare hands.
butch,Are you some kinda weirdo?
esmarelda,"No, it's a subject I have much interest in. You are the first person I ever met who has killed somebody. So, what was it like to kill a man?"
butch,"Tell ya what, you give me one of them cigarettes, I'll give you an answer."
esmarelda,Deal!
butch,So...
butch,...Esmarelda Villalobos  is that Mexican?
esmarelda,"The name is Spanish, but I'm Columbian."
butch,It's a very pretty name.
esmarelda,"It mean ""Esmarelda of the wolves."""
butch,"That's one hell of a name you got there, sister."
esmarelda,Thank you. And what is your name?
butch,Butch.
esmarelda,Butch. What does it mean?
butch,"I'm an American, our names don't mean shit. Anyway, moving right along, what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?"
esmarelda,I want to know what it feels like to kill a man
butch,"I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead. Now I know he's dead, do you wanna know how I feel about it?"
butch,I don't feel the least little bit bad.
butch," What'd I tell ya, soon as the word got out a fix was in, the odds would be outta control. Hey, if he was a better fighter he's be alive. If he never laced up his gloves in the first place, which he never shoulda done, he'd be alive. Enough about the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you spread it around with?"
butch," Fabienne my love, our adventure begins."
esmarelda,Forty-five sixty.
butch,Merci beaucoup. And here's a little something for the effort.
butch,"Now if anybody should ask you about who your fare was tonight, what're you gonna tell 'em?"
esmarelda,"The truth. Three well-dressed, slightly toasted, Mexicans."
butch,"Bon soir, Esmarelda."
esmarelda," Sleep well, Butch."
fabienne,Keep the light off.
butch,"Is that better, sugar pop?"
fabienne,Oui. Hard day at the office?
butch,Pretty hard. I got into a fight.
fabienne,Poor baby. Can we make spoons?
fabienne,I was looking at myself in the mirror.
butch,Uh-huh?
fabienne,I wish I had a pot.
butch,You were lookin' in the mirror and you wish you had some pot?
fabienne,A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are sexy.
butch,"Well you should be happy, 'cause you do."
fabienne,"Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did ""Lucky Star,"" it's not the same thing."
butch,I didn't realize there was a difference between a tummy and a pot belly.
fabienne,The difference is huge.
butch,You want me to have a pot?
fabienne,"No. Pot bellies make a man look either oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The rest of you is normal. Normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass, but with a big, perfectly round pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a tee-shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it."
butch,You think guys would find that attractive?
fabienne,I don't give a damn what men find attractive. It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye is seldom the same.
butch,"If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in it."
fabienne,You'd punch me in my belly?
butch,Right in the belly.
fabienne,I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe.
butch,You'd do that to me?
fabienne,Yes!
butch,"Did you get everything, sugar pop?"
fabienne,"Yes, I did."
butch,Good job.
fabienne,Did everything go as planned?
butch,You didn't listen to the radio?
fabienne,I never listen to your fights. Were you the winner?
butch,I won alright.
fabienne,Are you still retiring?
butch,Sure am.
fabienne,What about the man you fought?
butch,Floyd retired too.
fabienne, Really?! He won't be fighting no more?!
butch,Not no more.
fabienne,So it all worked out in the finish?
butch,"We ain't at the finish, baby."
fabienne,"We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?"
fabienne,"If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they?"
fabienne,"But they won't find us, will they?"
fabienne,Do you still want me to go with you?
fabienne,I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance -
fabienne,Say it!
butch,"Fabienne, I want you to be with me."
fabienne,Forever?
butch,...and ever.
fabienne,Do you love me?
butch,Oui.
fabienne,Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?
butch,Will you kiss it?
fabienne,But you first.
fabienne," Butch my love, the adventure begins."
butch,I think I cracked a rib.
fabienne,Giving me oral pleasure?
butch,"No retard, from the fight."
fabienne,Don't call me retard.
butch, My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!
fabienne,Shut up fuck head! I hate that Mongoloid voice.
butch,"Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it back!  Can I have a towel please, Miss Beautiful Tulip."
fabienne,"Oh I like that, I like being called a tulip. Tulip is much better than Mongoloid."
butch,"I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I called you a retard, but I took it back."
butch,Merci beaucoup.
fabienne,Butch?
butch," Yes, lemon pie."
fabienne,Where are we going to go?
butch,"I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. We're gonna get a lot of money from this. But it ain't gonna be so much, we can live like hogs in the fat house forever. I was thinking we could go somewhere in the South Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll carry us a long way down there."
fabienne,"So if we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?"
butch,"You betcha. And if after awhile you don't dig Bora Bora, then we can move over to Tahiti or Mexico."
fabienne,But I do not speak Spanish.
butch,"You don't speak Bora Boran either. Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta el zapataria?"
fabienne,What does that mean?
butch,Where's the shoe store?
fabienne,Donde esta el zapataria?
butch,Excellent pronunciation. You'll be my little mama ceta in no time.
fabienne,Que hora es?
fabienne,What time is it?
fabienne,Butch.
fabienne,Forget it.
fabienne,Merde! You startled me. Did you have a bad dream?
butch,What are you watching?
fabienne,"A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the name."
butch,Are you watchin' it?
fabienne,In a way. Why? Would you like for me to switch it off?
butch,Would you please?
butch,It's a little too early in the morning for explosions and war.
fabienne,What was it about?
butch,"How should I know, you were the one watchin' it."
fabienne,"No, imbecile, what was your dream about?"
butch,"Oh, I... don't remember. It's really rare I remember a dream."
fabienne,You just woke up from it.
butch,"Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I don't remember."
fabienne,"Well, let's look at the grumpy man in the morning. I didn't say you were lying, it's just odd you don't remember your dreams. I always remember mine. Did you know you talk in your sleep?"
butch,"I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk in my sleep?"
fabienne,You did last night.
butch,What did I say?
fabienne,I don't know. I couldn't understand you.
fabienne,Why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast at that breakfast place with the pancakes.
butch,One more kiss and I'll get up.
fabienne,Satisfied?
butch,Yep.
fabienne,"Then get up, lazy bones."
butch,What time is it?
fabienne,Almost nine in the morning. What time does our train arrive?
butch,Eleven.
fabienne,"I'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, eggs over easy, and five sausages."
butch, Anything to drink with that?
fabienne," Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a tall glass or orange juice and a black cup of coffee. After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie."
butch,Pie for breakfast?
fabienne,"Any time of the day is a good time for pie. Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes. And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese"
butch,where's my watch?
fabienne,It's there.
butch,"No, it's not. It's not here."
fabienne,Have you looked?
butch,Yes I've fuckin' looked!!
butch,What the fuck do you think I'm doing?! Are you sure you got it?
fabienne,Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer
butch,on the little kangaroo.
fabienne,"Yes, it was on your little kangaroo."
butch,Well it's not here!
fabienne, Well it should be!
butch,"Oh it most definitely should be here, but it's not. So where is it?"
butch,"Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin' watch. You know what my father went through to git me that watch?... I don't wanna get into it right now... but he went through a lot. Now all this other shit, you coulda set on fire, but I specifically reminded you not to forget my father's watch. Now think, did you get it?"
fabienne,I believe so...
butch,"You believe so? You either did, or you didn't, now which one is it?"
fabienne,Then I did.
butch,Are you sure?
fabienne, No.
butch, You left it at the apartment.
butch,"If you did leave it at the apartment, it's not your fault. I had you bring a bunch of stuff. I reminded you about it, but I didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me. If all I gave a fuck about was my watch, I should've told you. You ain't a mind reader."
fabienne,I'm sorry.
butch,Don't be. It just means I won't be able to eat breakfast with you.
fabienne,Why does it mean that?
butch,Because I'm going back to my apartment to get my watch.
fabienne,Won't the gangsters be looking for you there?
butch,"That's what I'm gonna find out. If they are, and I don't think I can handle it, I'll split."
fabienne,"I was so dreadful. I saw your watch, I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry."
butch,"Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing you could ever do would make me permanently angry at you.  Now here's some money, order those pancakes and have a great breakfast."
fabienne,Don't go.
butch,"I'll be back before you can say, blueberry pie."
fabienne,Blueberry pie.
butch,"Well maybe not that fast, but fast. Okay?  Okay?"
fabienne,Okay.
butch,"Bye-bye, sugar pop."
fabienne,Bye.
butch,I'm gonna take your Honda.
fabienne,Okay.
butch,"Of all the fuckin' things she coulda forgot, she forgets my father's watch. I specifically reminded her not to forget it. ""Bedside table  on the kangaroo."" I said the words: ""Don't forget my father's watch."""
butch, Holy shit.
butch,"That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch.  They keep underestimatin' ya."
pedestrian,"Jesus, are you okay?"
butch,I guess.
marsellus, Who?
marsellus,"Well, I'll be damned."
butch,Sacre bleu.
maynard,Can I help you wit' somethin'?
butch,Shut up!
maynard,Now you just wait one goddamn minute
butch,"So you like chasing people, huh?"
butch,"Well guess what, big man, you caught me"
butch,"Look mister, this ain't any of your business"
maynard,I'm makin' it my business! Now toss that gun!
maynard,"Now you on top, stand up and come to the counter."
maynard,Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just caught a coupl'a flies.
maynard,Nobody kills anybody in my place of business except me or Zed.
maynard,That's Zed.
zed, You said you waited for me?
maynard,I did.
zed,Then how come they're all beat up?
maynard,They did that to each other. They was fightin' when they came in. This one was gonna shoot that one.
zed, You were gonna shoot him?
zed,"Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front of this place?"
maynard,"Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?"
zed,"No, it's Thursday."
maynard,Then she'll be fine.
zed,Bring out The Gimp.
maynard,I think The Gimp's sleepin'.
zed,"Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em up then, won't you?"
maynard, Wake up!
maynard, Down!
maynard,Who's first?
zed,I ain't fer sure yet.
zed,Wanna do it here?
maynard,"Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old room."
maynard, Up!
maynard,Keep an eye on this one.
the gimp,Huhng?
butch,Hey hillbilly.
butch,"You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up."
butch,You okay?
marsellus,Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay!
butch,What now?
marsellus,"What now? Well let me tell you what now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe- hittin' niggers, who'll go to work on homes here with a pair of pliers and a blow torch.  Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I ain't through with you by a damn sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on your ass."
butch,"I meant what now, between me and you?"
marsellus,"Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell ya what now between me an' you. There is no me an' you. Not no more."
butch,So we're cool?
marsellus,"Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I ask  two things I ask: Don't tell nobody about this. This shit's between me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'- the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in- agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It ain't nobody else's business. Two: leave town. Tonight. Right now. And when you're gone, stay gone.  You've lost your Los Angeles privileges. Deal?"
butch,Deal.
marsellus,"Go on now, get your ass outta here."
marsellus," Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta bit of a situation."
butch,"Honey, grab your radio and your purse and let's go!"
butch,Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train if we don't split now.
butch,"We're cool. In fact, we're super- cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait for you outside."
fabienne,Where did you get this motorcycle?
butch," It's a chopper, baby, hop on."
fabienne,What happened to my Honda?
butch,"Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda."
fabienne,You're hurt?
butch,"I might've broke my nose, no biggie. Hop on."
butch,"Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!"
butch,"I'm sorry, baby-love."
fabienne," You were gone so long, I started to think dreadful thoughts."
butch,"I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie. Everything's fine. Hey, how was breakfast?"
fabienne, It was good
butch,did you get the blueberry pancakes?
fabienne,"No, they didn't have blueberry pancakes, I had to get buttermilk are you sure you're okay?"
butch,"Baby-love, from the moment I left you, this has been without a doubt the single weirdest day of my entire life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about it."
fabienne,"Butch, whose motorcycle is this?"
butch,It's a chopper.
fabienne,Whose chopper is this?
butch,Zed's.
fabienne,Who's Zed?
butch,"Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead."
fourth man,Die... die... die... die...!
fourth man,I don't understand
vincent,Why the fuck didn't you tell us about that guy in the bathroom? Slip your mind?  Forget he was in there with a goddamn hand cannon?
jules, Did you see that gun he fired at us? It was bigger than him.
jules,We should be fuckin' dead!
vincent,"Yeah, we were lucky."
jules,That shit wasn't luck. That shit was somethin' else.
vincent,"Yeah, maybe."
jules,That was... divine intervention. You know what divine intervention is?
vincent,"Yeah, I think so. That means God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets."
jules,"Yeah, man, that's what is means. That's exactly what it means! God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets."
vincent,I think we should be going now.
jules,Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do that!  Don't blow this shit off! What just happened was a fuckin' miracle!
vincent,"Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit happens."
jules,"Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just happen."
vincent,"Do you wanna continue this theological discussion in the car, or at the jailhouse with the cops?"
jules,"We should be fuckin' dead now, my friend!  We just witnessed a miracle, and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge it!"
vincent,"Okay man, it was a miracle, can we leave now?"
vincent,"...Ever seen that show ""COPS?""  I was watchin' it once and this cop was on it who was talkin' about this time he got into this gun fight with a guy in a hallway. He unloads on this guy and he doesn't hit anything. And these guys were in a hallway. It's a freak, but it happens."
jules,"If you wanna play blind man, then go walk with a Shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open."
vincent,What the fuck does that mean?
jules,"That's it for me. For here on in, you can consider my ass retired."
vincent,Jesus Christ!
jules,Don't blaspheme!
vincent,"Goddammit, Jules"
jules,I said don't do that
vincent,you're fuckin' freakin' out!
jules,I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm through.
vincent,"While you're at it, be sure to tell 'im why."
jules,"Don't worry, I will."
vincent,"I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he laughs his ass off."
jules,I don't give a damn if he does.
vincent,"Marvin, what do you make of all this?"
marvin,I don't even have an opinion.
vincent,"C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets?"
jules,What the fuck's happening?
vincent,I just accidentally shot Marvin in the throat.
jules,Why the fuck did you do that?
vincent,I didn't mean to do it. I said it was an accident.
jules,I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in my time
vincent,"chill out, man, it was an accident, okay? You hit a bump or somethin' and the gun went off."
jules,The car didn't hit no motherfuckin' bump!
vincent,"Look! I didn't mean to shoot this son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went off, don't ask me how!"
jules,Look at this mess! We're drivin' around on a city street in broad daylight
vincent,"I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin' about the splatter."
jules,"Well you better be thinkin' about it now, motherfucker! We gotta get this car off the road. Cops tend to notice shit like you're driving a car drenched in fuckin' blood."
vincent,Can't we just take it to a friendly place?
jules,"This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus don't got no friendly places in the Valley."
vincent,"Well, don't look at me, this is your town, Jules."
vincent,Who ya callin'?
jules,A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.
vincent,Where's Toluca Lake.
jules,"On the other side of the hill, by Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any other partners in 818.  Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are in some serious shit. We're in a car we gotta get off the road, pronto! I need to use your garage for a couple hours."
jules,We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie's situation. He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door.
vincent,"If he kicks us out, whadda we do?"
jules,"Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made a couple phone calls. But I never want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's my friend and you don't bust in your friend's house and start tellin' 'im what's what."
vincent,Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.
jules,"Put yourself in his position. It's eight o'clock in the morning. He just woke up, he wasn't prepared for this shit. Don't forget who's doin' who a favor."
vincent,"If the price of that favor is I gotta take shit, he can stick his favor straight up his ass."
jules,What the fuck did you just do to his towel?
vincent,I was just dryin' my hands.
jules,You're supposed to wash 'em first.
vincent,You watched me wash 'em.
jules,I watched you get 'em wet.
vincent,"I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, I coulda done a better job."
jules,"I used the same soap you did and when I dried my hands, the towel didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who cares? But it's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a boil. If he were to come in here and see that towel like that... I'm tellin' you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie on account of you... Look, I ain't threatenin' you, I respect you an' all, just don't put me in that position."
jules,"Jules, you ask me nice like that, no problem. He's your friend, you handle him."
jules,"Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda been satisfied with freeze-dried Tasters Choice. You spring this gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What flavor is this?"
jimmie,"Knock it off, Julie."
jules,What?
jimmie,"I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can stop butterin' me up. I don't need you to tell me how good my coffee is. I'm the one who buys it, I know how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it. But what's on my mind at this moment isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's the dead nigger in my garage."
jules,Jimmie
jimmie,"I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a question, Jules. When you drove in here, did you notice a sign out front that said, ""Dead nigger storage?"""
jimmie,"answer to question. Did you see a sign out in front of my house that said, ""Dead nigger storage?"""
jules," Naw man, I didn't."
jimmie,You know why you didn't see that sign?
jules,Why?
jimmie,'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business!
jimmie,"I ain't through! Now don't you understand that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage counselor, no trial separation fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced. The last time me an' Bonnie talked about this shit was gonna be the last time me an' Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I wanna help ya out Julie, I really do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife doin' it."
jules,Jimmie
jimmie,"don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I can't be Jimmied. There's nothin' you can say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife. Now she's workin' the graveyard shift at the hospital. She'll be comin' home in less than an hour and a half. Make your phone calls, talk to your people, than get the fuck out of my house."
jules,That's all we want. We don't wanna fuck up your shit. We just need to call our people to bring us in.
jimmie,Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's in my bedroom.
marsellus,"...well, say she comes home. Whaddya think she'll do?  No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er, I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?"
jules,"You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is. If she comes home from a hard day's work and finds a bunch of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' what she's apt to do."
marsellus,"I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm doin' is contemplating the ""ifs."""
jules,"I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' ""ifs.""What I wanna hear from your ass is: ""you ain't got no problems, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be comin' directly."""
marsellus,"You ain't got no problems, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for The Wolf, who should be comin' directly."
jules,You sendin' The Wolf?
marsellus,Feel better?
jules,"Shit Negro, that's all you had to say."
the wolf, Jules...
the wolf,...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...
the wolf,Expect a call around 10:30. It's about thirty minutes away. I'll be there in ten.
the wolf,"You're Jimmie, right? This is your house?"
jimmie,Yeah.
the wolf," I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems."
jimmie,"Good, 'cause we got one."
the wolf,So I heard. May I come in?
jimmie,Please do.
the wolf,"You must be Jules, which would make you Vincent. Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking, is that right, Jimmie?"
jimmie,100%.
the wolf,"Your wife, Bonnie...  ...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is that correct?"
jimmie,Uh-huh.
the wolf,"I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it none too much."
jimmie,She won't at that.
the wolf,"That gives us forty minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you do what I say when I say it, should by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it."
the wolf,Jimmie?
jimmie,Yes.
the wolf,"Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I smelled some coffee in there. Would you make me a cup?"
jimmie,"Sure, how do you take it?"
the wolf,"Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar."
the wolf,"About the car, is there anything I need to know? Does it stall, does it make a lot of noise, does it smoke, is there gas in it, anything?"
jules,"Aside from how it looks, the car's cool."
the wolf,Positive?  Don't get me out on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work.
jules,"Hey man, as far as I know, the motherfucker's tip-top."
the wolf,"Good enough, let's go back to the kitchen."
the wolf,"Thank you, Jimmie."
the wolf,"Okay first thing, you two.  Take the body, stick it in the trunk. Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house. That would lead me to believe that in the garage or under the sink, you got a bunch of cleansers and cleaners and shit like that, am I correct?"
jimmie,Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.
the wolf,"Good. What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car. And I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You need to go in the backseat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe down the upholstery  now when it comes to upholstery, it don't need to be spic and span, you don't need to eat off it. Give it a good once over. What you need to take care of are the really messy parts. The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up.  But the windows are a different story.  Them you really clean. Get the Windex, do a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet. I need blankets, I need comforters, I need quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker the better, the darker the better. No whites, can't use 'em. We need to camouflage the interior of the car. We're gonna line the front seat and the backseat and the floor boards with quilts and blankets. If a cop stops us and starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last. But at a glance, the car will appear to be normal.  Jimmie lead the way, boys  get to work."
vincent," A ""please"" would be nice."
the wolf,Come again?
vincent,"I said a ""please"" would be nice."
the wolf,"Set is straight, Buster. I'm not here to say ""please.""I'm here to tell you want to do. And if self- preservation is an instinct you possess, you better fuckin' do it and do it quick. I'm here to help. If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck gentlemen."
jules,"It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your help is definitely appreciated."
vincent,I don't mean any disrespect. I just don't like people barkin' orders at me.
the wolf,"If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor. I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you want to get out of this. So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car."
the wolf," How we comin', Jimmie?"
jimmie,"Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand somethin'"
the wolf,"Winston, Jimmie  please, Winston."
jimmie,"You gotta understand something, Winston. I want to help you guys out and all, but that's my best linen. It was a wedding present from my Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and they ain't with us anymore"
the wolf,"let me ask you a question, if you don't mind?"
jimmie,Sure.
the wolf,Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny millionaires?
jimmie,No.
the wolf,"Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they would've furnished you with a whole bedroom set, which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do.  I like oak myself, that's what's in my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, you an oak man?"
jimmie,Oak's nice.
jules,I will never forgive your ass for this shit. This is some fucked-up repugnant shit!
vincent,"Did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he's wrong, he's immediately forgiven for all wrong-doings?"
jules,"Man, get outta my face with that shit! The motherfucker who said that never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull with his fingers on account of your dumb ass."
vincent,"I got a threshold, Jules. I got a threshold for the abuse I'll take. And you're crossin' it. I'm a race car and you got me in the red. Redline 7000, that's where you are. Just know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be drivin' a race car when it's in the red. It could blow."
jules,"You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker! Every time my fingers touch brain I'm ""SUPERFLY T.N.T,"" I'm the ""GUNS OF NAVARONE."" I'm what Jimmie Walker usta talk about. In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin' windows and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull."
the wolf,"Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out of this yet."
jimmie,I can't believe that's the same car.
the wolf,"Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet. Phase one is complete, clean the car, which moves us right along to phase two, clean you two."
the wolf,Strip.
vincent,All the way?
the wolf,To your bare ass.
the wolf,"Quickly gentlemen, we got about fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better- half comes pulling into the driveway."
jules,This morning air is some chilly shit.
vincent,Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?
the wolf,You know what you two look like?
vincent,What?
the wolf,"Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head. Yes, strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's garbage bag."
jules,"Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid like puttin' that out in front of your house for Elmo the garbage man to take away."
the wolf,"Don't worry, we're takin' it with us. Jim, the soap."
the wolf,"Okay gentlemen, you're both been to County before, I'm sure. Here it comes."
jules,"Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!"
the wolf,"Better you than me, gentlemen."
the wolf,"Don't be afraid of the soap, spread it around."
the wolf,Towel 'em.
the wolf,"You're dry enough, give 'em their clothes."
the wolf,"Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've planned this better. You guys look like... what do they look like, Jimmie?"
jimmie,Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.
jules,"Ha ha ha. They're your clothes, motherfucker."
jimmie,I guess you just gotta know how to wear them.
jules,"Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert on wearin' dorky shit that your is."
the wolf,"C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and jokin' our way into prison. Don't make me beg."
the wolf,"Gentlemen, let's get our rules of the road straight. We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma. The place is North Hollywood, so a few twist and turns aside, we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll drive the tainted car. Jules, you ride with me.  Vincent, you follow in my Porsche. Now if we cross the path of any John Q. Laws, nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something."
jules,Don't do shit unless
the wolf,unless what?
jules,Unless you do it first.
the wolf,"Spoken like a true prodigy.  How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?"
vincent,"I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went off, I dunno how."
the wolf,"Fair enough.  I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep up. If I get my car back any different than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies."
jules,We cool?
winston,Like it never happened.
winston,"Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all this will be hers."
raquel," Hi. You know, if they ever do ""I SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE,"" you guys, I'd be great.  What's with the outfits. You guys going to a volleyball game?"
winston,I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast. Maybe I can drop you two off. Where do you live?
vincent,Redondo Beach.
jules,Inglewood.
winston," Say goodbye, Raquel."
raquel,"Goodbye, Raquel."
winston,"I'll see you two around, and stay outta trouble, you crazy kids."
jules,Mr. Wolf.
jules,I was a pleasure watchin' you work.
winston,Call me Winston.
winston,"You hear that, young lady? Respect. You could lean a lot from those two fine specimens. Respect for one's elders shows character."
raquel,I have character.
winston,Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character.
raquel,"Oh you're so funny, oh you're so funny."
jules,Wanna share a cab?
vincent,You know I could go for some breakfast.  Want to have breakfast with me?
jules,Sure.
vincent,Thanks a bunch.  Want a sausage?
jules,"Naw, I don't eat pork."
vincent,Are you Jewish?
jules,"I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig on swine."
vincent,Why not?
jules,They're filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals.
vincent,Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste good.
jules,"A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't wanna eat nothin' that ain't got enough sense to disregard its own feces."
vincent,How about dogs? Dogs eat their own feces.
jules,I don't eat dog either.
vincent,"Yes, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?"
jules,"I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty. But a dog's got personality. And personality goes a long way."
vincent,"So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he's cease to be a filthy animal?"
jules,We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.
vincent,Good for you. Lighten up a little. You been sittin' there all quiet.
jules,I just been sittin' here thinkin'.
vincent, About what?
jules,The miracle we witnessed.
vincent,The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence.
jules,Do you know that a miracle is?
vincent,An act of God.
jules,What's an act of God?
vincent,"I guess it's when God makes the impossible possible. And I'm sorry Jules, but I don't think what happened this morning qualifies."
jules,"Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't matter. You're judging this thing the wrong way. It's not about what. It could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge shit like this based on merit. Whether or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant. What is significant is I felt God's touch, God got involved."
vincent,But why?
jules,That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I don't know why. But I can't go back to sleep.
vincent,"So you're serious, you're really gonna quit?"
jules,"The life, most definitely."
patron,Garcon! Coffee!
vincent,"So if you're quitting the life, what'll you do?"
jules,"That's what I've been sitting here contemplating. First, I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I'm gonna walk the earth."
vincent,"What do you mean, walk the earth?"
jules,"You know, like Caine in ""KUNG FU."" Just walk from town to town, meet people, get in adventures."
vincent,How long do you intend to walk the earth?
jules,Until God puts me where he want me to be.
vincent,What if he never does?
jules,"If it takes forever, I'll wait forever."
vincent,So you decided to be a bum?
jules,"I'll just be Jules, Vincent  no more, no less."
vincent,"No Jules, you're gonna be like those pieces of shit out there who beg for change. They walk around like a bunch of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in garbage bins, they eat what I throw away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got a word for 'em, they're called bums. And without a job, residence, or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be  a fuckin' bum!"
jules,"Look my friend, this is just where me and you differ"
vincent,what happened was peculiar  no doubt about it  but it wasn't water into wine.
jules,"All shapes and sizes, Vince."
vincent,Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!
jules,"If you find my answers frightening, Vincent, you should cease askin' scary questions."
vincent,I gotta take a shit. To be continued.
pumpkin,"Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!"
honey bunny,Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers!  Got that?!
pumpkin,"Customers stay seated, waitresses on the floor."
honey bunny,"Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, do it or fucking die!"
pumpkin,"You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out here!  Asta luego!"
pumpkin,"On the floor or I'll cook you ass, comprende?"
manager,"I'm the manager here, there's no problem, no problem at all"
pumpkin,You're gonna give me a problem?
pumpkin,What? You said you're gonna give me a problem?
manager,"No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you any problem!"
pumpkin,"I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks like the hero type to me!"
honey bunny,Don't take any chances. Execute him!
manager,Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm just a coffee shop manager. Take anything you want.
pumpkin,Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll be all over.
manager,Everybody just be calm and cooperate with them and this will be all over soon!
pumpkin,"Well done, now git your fuckin' ass on the ground."
pumpkin,"Okay people, I'm going to go 'round and collect your wallets. Don't talk, just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?"
pumpkin,In the bag.
pumpkin,What's in that?
jules,My boss' dirty laundry.
pumpkin,You boss makes you do his laundry?
jules,When he wants it clean.
pumpkin,Sounds like a shit job.
jules,"Funny, I've been thinkin' the same thing."
pumpkin,Open it up.
jules,'Fraid I can't do that.
pumpkin,I didn't hear you.
jules,"Yes, you did."
honey bunny,What's goin' on?
pumpkin,Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.
honey bunny,Shoot 'em in the face!
jules,"I don't mean to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had gun pointed at me."
pumpkin,"You don't open up that case, it's gonna be the last."
manager," Quit causing problems, you'll get us all killed! Give 'em what you got and get 'em out of here."
jules,"Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat man, this ain't any of your goddamn business!"
pumpkin,"I'm countin' to three, and if your hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna unload right in your fuckin' face. Clear? One..."
pumpkin,...two... three.
jules,You win.
jules,"It's all yours, Ringo."
pumpkin,Open it.
honey bunny,What is it? What is it?
pumpkin, Is that what I think it is?
pumpkin,It's beautiful.
honey bunny,"Goddammit, what is it?"
honey bunny,"Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're gonna fuckin' die bad!"
jules," Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!"
pumpkin,"Chill out, honey!"
honey bunny,Let him go!
jules, Tell her it's gonna be okay.
pumpkin,I'm gonna be okay.
jules,Promise her.
pumpkin,I promise.
jules,Tell her to chill.
pumpkin,Just chill out.
jules,What's her name?
pumpkin,Yolanda.
jules," So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna do anything stupid, are we?"
yolanda, Don't you hurt him.
jules,Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're gonna be like three Fonzies. And what' Fonzie like?
jules,"C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?"
yolanda, He's cool?
jules,"Correct-amundo! And that's what we're gonna be, we're gonna be cool.  Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three and I want you to let go your gun and lay your palms flat on the table. But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?"
jules,One... two... three.
yolanda,"Okay, now let him go!"
jules,"Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be cool.  When you yell at me, it makes me nervous.  When I get nervous, I get scared. And when motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers get accidentally shot."
yolanda," Just know: you hurt him, you die."
jules,"That seems to be the situation. Now I don't want that and you don't want that and Ringo here don't want that. So let's see what we can do.  Now this is the situation. Normally both of your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken. But you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period. I don't wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. But I'm afraid I can't give you the case. It don't belong to me. Besides, I went through too much shit this morning on account of this case to just hand it over to your ass."
jules,"It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's cool baby, nothin's changed. We're still just talkin'.  Tell her we're still cool."
pumpkin,"It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still cool."
vincent," What the hell's goin' on, Jules?"
jules,Nothin' I can't handle. I want you to just hang back and don't do shit unless it's absolutely necessary.
vincent,Check.
jules,"Yolanda, how we doin, baby?"
yolanda,I gotta go pee! I want to go home.
jules,"Just hang in there, baby, you're doing' great, Ringo's proud of you and so am I.  It's almost over.  Now I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet."
pumpkin,Which one is it?
jules,It's the one that says Bad Motherfucker on it.
jules,That's my bad motherfucker. Now open it up and take out the cash. How much is there?
pumpkin,About fifteen hundred dollars.
jules,"Put it in your pocket, it's yours. Now with the rest of them wallets and the register, that makes this a pretty successful little score."
vincent,"Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on general principle."
jules,"You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, now hang back and shut the fuck up. Besides, I ain't givin' it to him. I'm buyin' somethin' for my money. Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?"
pumpkin,What?
jules,Your life. I'm givin' you that money so I don't hafta kill your ass. You read the Bible?
pumpkin,Not regularly.
jules,"There's a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."" I been sayin' that shit for years.  And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a coldblooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or is could by you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish.  I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd."
jules, It's cold.
vincent,I think we oughta leave now.
jules,That's probably a good idea.
