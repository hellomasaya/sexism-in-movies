Speaker,Dialogue
marcus,"Hey, you want to hear my short story now?"
vi,Huh?
marcus, I can read it to you.
vi,"You mean, again?"
marcus,"Well, I changed the ending a little."
vi,Oh. What happens now?
marcus,"Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw."
vi,"Well then, maybe you should just read the ending."
marcus,But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
vi,I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
marcus,So you don't want to hear my new ending?
vi,"You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me.  Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral."
marcus,You're tired of me. I can tell.
vi,"Marcus, I'm tired. That's all."
marcus,You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
vi,I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
marcus,"Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You feel You feel pity now. The pleasure isn't there any more. The kinkiness has gone...You've become kind."
marcus,"""...but when he saw her...it was as if he could walk like a normal person. His legs didn't swing, his arms didn't spaz away...He wasn't a freak any more, for she made him forget his affliction. No more cerebral palsy! From now on  ""CP"" stood for...cerebral person. He was a cerebral person."
amy,"I thought it was really good, Marcus...Really moving and emotional."
elli,"Yeah, I thought it was really emotional, too."
amy,"And I mean, really good word choices. It kind of reminded me a little of Faulkner, but East Coast and disabled."
lucy,Or Flannery O'Connor. She had multiple sclerosis.
joyce,And Borges. He was blind.
ethan,Updike has psoriasis.
catherine,"Um...Maybe I'm wrong, but, um, I'm afraid I found the whole thing to be a little trite. Its earnestness is, well...it's a little embarrassing. And those adjectives, they're a little flatfooted. And redundant. I'm sorry, but...Anyway, what do I know? Don't even listen to what I say. I mean..."
mr scott,Anyone else?
mr scott,"Catherine is right. The story's a piece of shit. You express nothing but banalities and, formally speaking, are unable to construct a single compelling sentence. You ride on a wave of clichs so worn, in fact, it actually approaches a level of grotesquerie. Ad your subtitle, 'the rawness of truth' is that supposed to be a joke of some sort? Or are you just being pretentious?  OK. Who's next?"
vi,"Marcus, wait up!"
marcus,What do you want?
vi,Don't be so upset. It's OK...
marcus,What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
vi, You know he hated my story also.
marcus,Your story was terrible!
vi,Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
marcus,Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
vi,That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like     that bitch Catherine.
marcus,"Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered."
vi,"I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize."
marcus,You just want to fuck him. Like Catherine and every other white cunt on campus.
melinda,Vi? Are you OK?
vi,Yes. I'm OK. I'm totally OK.
melinda,You did the right thing.
vi,I know that. Fucking cripple. Why do I waste my time with undergrads? They're all so...juvenile! Uch! I just thought Marcus would be different. I mean he's got CP!
melinda,What are you gonna do now?
vi,I dunno...go to a bar...get laid...whatever...Don't worry about me. I'll be fine...
vi,Can I have a beer?
mr scott,"Hello, Vi."
vi,What are you doing here?
mr scott,What are you doing here?
vi,"I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all."
mr scott,"Well, now you have."
vi,"Yeah, um, then...are you alone?"
mr scott,Uh huh.
vi,Can I join you?
mr scott,You're not.
vi,Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
mr scott,That's good.
vi,And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
mr scott,You have beautiful skin.
vi,Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
mr scott,Maybe. She's OK.
vi,Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
mr scott,I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
vi,Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
mr scott,No.
vi,Thank you for being honest.
vi,I have so much respect for you.
vi,Can I just freshen up for a second?
mr scott,It's over there.
vi,Thanks.
vi, Don't be a racist. Don't be a racist. Don't be a racist...
vi,It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
mr scott,Take off your top.
mr scott,Now...take off the rest.
mr scott,Turn around.
mr scott,Bend over.
vi,"Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that."
mr scott,"Say, Ni..."
vi,Ni...
mr scott,...gger.
vi,...gger.
mr scott,"Say, 'Nigger.'"
vi,Nigger.
mr scott,'Fuck me hard!'
vi,Fuck me hard!
mr scott,"Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'"
vi,"Nigger, fuck me hard!"
mr scott,Again!
vi,"Nigger, fuck me hard!!..."
mr scott,Again!!
vi,"NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!..."
marcus,Freak.
vi,Can I come in?
marcus,You're all...sweaty!
vi,"'...So John flipped her around and slammed her against the wall. Jane braced herself: she thought about her mother. She thought about Peter. She thought about God...and rape. ''Say, 'Fuck me, nigger. Fuck me hard.''' John's flesh abraded her soft skin. There would be marks. She acquiesced, and said what he asked her to say, and did what he asked her to do. She had entered college with hope, with dignity, but she would graduate as a whore.'"
amy,"Why do people have to be so ugly...write about such ugly characters? It's perverted. I know you all think I'm being prisssy, but I don't care. I was brought up in a certain way. And this is...mean-spirited!"
joyce,"Yeah, well, it did seem a little affected. Like by using taboo language you were trying to shock us about the hollowness of your characters."
ethan,I think it was a little bit racist.
elli,"It was completely racist, and beyond that I felt deeply offended as a     woman. As if a woman can only operate from experiences of objectification."
sue,Totally phallocentric.
elli,"And so weirdly misogynistic. I mean, why does Jane go through with this? Is she stupid?"
ethan,"Hey, But wasn't this a rape? Or ...did I miss something? Because I - I'm confused. Because if this was a rape, then why would she be a whore?"
catherine," It was confessional, yet dishonest. Jane pretends to be horrified by     the sexuality that she in fact fetishizes. She subsumes herself to the myth of black male potency, but then doesn't follow through. She thinks she 'respects Afro-Americans,' she thinks they're 'cool,' 'exotic,' what a notch he 'd make in her belt, but, of course, it all comes down to mandingo clich, and he calls her on it. In classic racist tradition she demonizes, then runs for cover. But then, how could she behave otherwise? She's just a spoiled suburban white girl with a Benneton rainbow complex. It's just my opinion, and what do I know...but I think it's a callow piece of writing."
mr scott,"Callow and coy. Jane wants more, but isn't honest enough to admit it. In the end, she returns to the safety of her crippled  boyfriend."
marcus,This is bullshit! Her story was the truth!
joyce,Right.
sue,It's unbelievable!
elli,It's clichd!
amy,It's disgusting!
vi,But it happened!
mr scott,"I don't know about 'what happened,' Vi, because once you start writing, it  all becomes fiction. Still, it certainly is an improvement over your last story: There is now at least a beginning, a middle, and an end."
toby,"Hello, is this Pam?"
toby,Toby Oxman.
toby,"Oh, fine. How are you?"
toby,Great!
toby,That's what I was gonna ask you.
toby,"Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do..."
toby,"So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?"
toby,"Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on."
toby,"Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that."
toby,"Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out."
toby,"Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing."
toby,"Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished."
toby,"I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity."
toby,I'm a documentary filmmaker.
toby,"N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?"
toby,"Oh, I don't remember that..."
toby,"Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then..."
toby,"Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies."
toby,Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
toby,Huh. Kids?
toby,How many?
toby,Great. How old are they?
toby,"Wow, that really is great. In a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!  Pause."
toby,"Yeah, sure."
toby, Maybe she has caller ID.
scooby,"No, not really."
scooby,No.
scooby,I hate reading.
scooby,OK.
scooby,I dunno...
scooby,"Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman."
scooby,I dunno. See if I have any connections.
fern,Did you knock on his door?
mickey,"Yes, but he just shouted at me and used the f-word."
marty,Scooby! Dinner!
mickey,Would anyone be interested in being hypnotized after dinner?
fern,Let's just start.
marty,I don't know what's wrong with that kid.
brady,Maybe he's gay.
marty,Don't ever say that.
brady,What if he is?
marty,He isn't.
fern,"Marty, ignore him."
brady,"He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports..."
marty,Brady!
fern,And even if he is...
mikey,"Gay people are people too, you know. You're just being prejudiced."
brady,"I don't care is he's gay. I'm cool. I mean, it's not like I have to share his room or anything."
marty,I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
mikey,Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
fern,Don't even joke about that!
mikey,I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
scooby,Was anyone in my room today?
fern,Is everything OK?
scooby,My CD case like totally collapsed. I'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend.  Hey. Can you pass the salad over.
marty, Good.
fern,Got a lot of homework?
scooby,I dunno.
marty,Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
fern,Marty...
marty, You started filling out your college applications yet?
scooby,I'm not going to college.
fern,What are you going to do?
scooby,I dunno.
marty,What DO you know?
scooby,"Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and..."
marty,Out! Leave the table!
brady,What?
marty,You heard me: leave the table!
brady," Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!"
mikey,"Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't."
marty,"Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair."
brady,"I'll talk to you later, man!"
cheryl,"Thanks, Esposito!"
mikey,Consuelo?
consuelo,"Yes, Mikey?"
mikey,Do you have any brothers or sisters?
consuelo,Yes.
mikey,Really? How many?
consuelo,Four brothers and five sisters.
mikey,"Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?"
consuelo,It was God's will.
mikey,"But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?"
consuelo, No.
marty,So? How was school today?
scooby,The same.
marty,The same. Same as what?
scooby,Just the same.
brady,We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
marty,"Oh, yeah?"
scooby,We did the same thing last year also.
fern,How was the class?
brady,"Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?"
fern,"Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor."
brady,He was in a concentration camp?
fern,"Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis."
brady,But I thought he came over to America before the war.
fern,"Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor."
brady,Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
fern,"But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you."
mikey,Or me?
scooby,"You mean, then, we're all survivors?"
fern,"Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European."
scooby,"But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born."
marty,Get the hell outta here!
scooby," Man, it's just, like, conversation."
mr kirk,Tell me: you make a living at this?
toby,"Well, sir...uh...I'm actually not doing this for the money. When you make a documentary, you do it for many reasons, but money is certainly not one of them."
mr kirk,I don't get it.
toby,"Well, sir, a lot has happened to the landscape of the suburban high school since I was a student, and I feel it would be a valuable, perhaps even enlightening endeavor, to chronicle the changes, to get intimate with the realities kids and parents face in American schools today."
mr kirk,"Yeah, well, whatever. I'll let you know if there's interest."
toby,"Excuse me, where's the bathroom?"
scooby,You a pervert?
toby,"No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?"
scooby,"Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?"
toby,"Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact."
scooby,What for?
toby,Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
scooby,Is this to like get into Sundance?
toby,"Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it."
scooby,Doubt it.
toby,"Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel."
scooby,Whoopee.
toby,HBO and MTV have also shown some interest.
scooby,So you have connections...
toby,...kind of An American Family for the new millennium...
fern,I thought this was about kids getting into college.
toby,"Oh, it is. I mean"
marty,Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
toby,You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
marty,And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
toby,Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
scooby,"Yeah, I thought I was the focus."
mikey,I wanna be the focus.
fern,"Toby, we need this to be a positive experience."
toby,"Well, I suppose I could reconceive..."
toby,"'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope..."
mikey,Twinkeys!
fern,"Boys, take napkins...Napkins..."
marty,"Not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?"
fern," Don't worry, he doesn't mean money."
toby,"Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience."
marty,Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
fern,"No, it's true."
toby,"Mr Livingston, I fully understand and I share your concerns. You fell vulnerable. And I know that this is a very difficult question, but what it comes down to is: can you make a leap of faith in me, in the same way that I have to make a leap of faith in you?"
esposito,"This is a great school. I don't care what anybody says. I mean, it's not perfect, but like the people are really cool, like the teachers and kids...they really care and all. And I know that they make fun of New Jersey all the time, but I don't care. 'Cause they're just snobs. 'Cause Jersey is where America's at!"
toby,So whaddya think?
editor,"Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are."
toby,I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
editor,"You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people."
editor,"No, you don't."
toby,"Yes, I do. I love them!"
editor,The camerawork's nice.
toby,"Thanks. I'll tell Mike.  Well, it's still just a beginning. I know I can...dig deeper."
fern,"...but Marj  may I call you Marj? what it really boils down to is...what does it mean to be a Jew?...Exactly. Tzedakah. Charity. And the new wing at Beth Israel is...Well, actually, last year you gave $500. But this year $1,000 would not only be a mitzvah, it would bring you to a new level...Yes, of course. Your gift would also give you a Chagall menorah and two tickets to the dinner dance this spring...Because it's true: Israel needs us now. If not now, when?...Well, that's wonderful...I'll speak to you next week...You too! Take care!"
fern,"Hi, Scooby! How was school today?"
scooby,Fine.
fern,Ready for tomorrow?
scooby,What's tomorrow?
fern,"The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them."
mikey,Mom?
fern,"Yes, Mikey?"
mikey,I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
fern,What?
mikey,"550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade!"
marty,Scooby?
scooby,Yeah?
marty,We have to talk.
scooby,Whaddya wanna talk about?
marty,"Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them."
scooby,OK.
marty, Tired of this shit...
toby,So are you surprised that Scooby took the SATs after all?
brady,Not really. He's kind of a wuss.
toby,"OK. How about you, Cheryl? Were you surprised?"
cheryl,I dunno. Whatever.
toby,Hmm.
brady,"Hey, how come you drive such a shitty car?"
cheryl,Yeah.
toby," I don't know...That's interesting, though. A cool car. Is that something that's real important to you, Brady?"
brady,Yeah.
cheryl,Uh duh.
scooby,"Pretty cool, Stanley."
stanley,Thanks.
scooby,How'd you get it?
stanley,It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
scooby,"Gee, your Dad's smart."
stanley,I know.
scooby,Is it loaded?
stanley,"No, I don't think so..."
stanley,"Scooby, don't! Be careful!"
scooby,"I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV."
scooby,You should be.
scooby,Here. You can keep it.
scooby,Yeah?
scooby,Yeah. I know.
scooby,OK. If you feel like it. Just give me a second.
scooby,You want some?
stanley,"No, thanks."
marty,I'm so sorry! I should never have made you take the SATs!
conan,"Hey, Scooby! How's it going?"
scooby,Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
conan,I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
scooby,I'll be your guest!
conan,"Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look."
scooby,Cool!
conan,"Welcome to the show, Scooby."
scooby,Thank you.
conan,Nice to have you here.
scooby,Great to be here.
conan,And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
conan,Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
conan,"TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute."
conan,"Let's see what they think of the first idea. I'm curious what the audience thinks. Folks, what do you think: should Scooby be my new sidekick?"
conan,"Scooby, new sidekick, everybody!"
scooby,Yeah?
brady,Hey.
scooby,Hey. What's up?
brady,There's something I need to talk about with you.
scooby,What?
brady,There are some rumors...
scooby,Like what?
brady,You know...Stanley...
scooby,Oh.
brady,"And like, don't take this the wrong way...I mean, I'm cool...but...you know...I've got a good reputation at school and, well...I really don't want it ruined."
scooby,No prob. I'm cool.
brady,"Thanks, Scoob."
coach,"Esposito, What the fuck do you think you're doing? You're tackling like a bitch on my football team, son! You gotta bend your ass over and hit somebody! You understand me?"
esposito,"Yes, sir!"
coach,You understand me?
esposito,"Yes, sir!"
coach,"Then do it!...Livingston! That's the way to hit that hole, son!"
coach,"We're gonna become a football team today, guys! Let's move the ball! Move! Move! Move! I wanna see you hit those holes! Defense, fill those goddam gaps! Let's go, guys! Let's do it!..."
mikey,When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
consuelo,I did not go to high school.
mikey,Weren't there high schools in El Salvador?
consuelo,We had to work. My family was poor.
mikey,Must've been hard being poor.
consuelo,I'm still poor.
mikey,"Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?"
consuelo,"No, Mikey."
mikey,"But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?"
consuelo,I'm always working.
mikey,But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
consuelo,This is work.
mikey,But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.
mikey,"You know, your job's really not so bad, if you think about it. You should smile more often."
dr jordan,When Brady first arrived at the hospital he was unresponsive to verbal stimuli. Wee performed a CT scan which demonstrated a large subdural hemotoma with mass effect. Since the removal of the subdural he's been in coma.
dr goodman,When I first met the Livingstons it was in the first twenty four hours of Brady coming in after his tragic football accident and they were acting in a fairly typical way
marty,We're not the ones who need the help. My son needs help.
editor,This is definitely better.
toby,You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
editor,"This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative."
toby,"Yes, I knowBut still, it should be somewhat entertaining."
editor,"I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation."
toby,"No, no, no. No exploitation. This is seriousBut don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?"
editor,You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
toby,"Nothing, I guess"
editor,"I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?"
toby,"OK, you're right, you're right  You know, we need to screen what we've gotinvite some regular people, just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this."
editor,"I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening"
toby,"OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types."
editor,We're not ready.
toby,Hip alternative types who will understand the process better
editor,We're not ready!
toby,"Well, I need to see this with an audience!"
editor,What's an audience going to tell you?
toby,I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
mikey,Consuelo! I spilled some grape juice on the floor!Consuelo?!
mikey,Consuelo?
mikey,Consuelo. Are you crying?
consuelo,No.
mikey,"Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?"
mikey,Speak English.
mikey,"Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you."
mikey,Who is Jesus?
mikey,You have a bay?
mikey,"Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?"
mikey,Oh. How did it happen?
mikey,How did they execute him?
mikey," Maybe it's for the bestI mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrongPeople who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?"
consuelo,Jesus was not bad.
mikey,Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
consuelo,He wasn't.
mikey,"But still, you can't be sure."
consuelo,I am sure.
mikey,"But really, you never know."
consuelo,I know!
mikey, Why was he on Death Row?
consuelo,For rape and murder.
mikey,"Consuelo, what is rape exactly?"
consuelo," It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it."
mikey,Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
consuelo,"Well then, when you get older you can do something about it."
mikey,Consuelo? I spilled some grape juice upstairs. Do you think you could clean up the floor now?
mikey,Dad?Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
marty,One in a million recover.
marty,"Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line."
marty,Thanks.
marty,Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
mikey,OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
mikey,Just a sec!Be right there!
mikey,"Dad, can you turn around a bit, please?"
mikey,Thanks. All right. Now you must look at this shiny object and concentrate. Relax your legs. Relax your arms. Relax your shoulders. Now keep your eyes on the shiny objectYour eyelids are getting heavyheavierYou're getting sleepysleepierNow let your eyes close shutand you are asleep.
mikey,"Now you are completely under my power. I am the only voice you can hear, the only voice you will listen to. Now. When you wake up you will be in a good mood. You won't worry so much about Brady. And I will be your favorite from now on. If Brady dies, you can be sad for a little bit, but I will still be the most important person in your life. You will never be mean to me, and always give me whatever I want. Also, you should fire Consuelo. She's lazy. Now when I snap my fingers, you will remember nothing, but you will do everything I have asked. One. Two. Three."
marty,"Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?"

scooby,"So like, yeahI caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviewsY'know, I figure I can always drop out."
scooby,Prnceton.
scooby,"200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird, I know. But I think they thought it was, like, good-weird."

fern,"You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby."

mikey,"Sure, Dad."
marty,"Consuelo. Mrs. Livingston and I have discussed this, and we've come to the conclusion that we are not very happy with your work lately, so we're going to let you go."
consuelo,I-I don't understand.
marty,"We've been happy with you in the past, but now we think maybe it's time for a changeuhI know you've had trouble at home and maybe, you know, some of that is reflected I your work"
consuelo,"But, Mr Livingston, I work very hard for you and your family!"

marty,"I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit aa speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy."
marty,"I don't know why this is so hard for you to comprehend. I had a terrific time in college. I've got a terrific job, a comfortable salary, terrific wife, three terrific kidsand every year I give to the alumni fund. Now why are you trying to make college out to be a bad thing, a negative experience? You were unhappy? Well, to bad! Get over it! Stop trying to impose your misery on others by going around saying, 'Life is bad, life is horrible.' Life is tough on you? Well, boo hoo!"
scooby,"...Well, yeah, my Dad is kind of a goofball. I just have to pretend to go along with his ideas. 'Cause he really doesn't get it: like I could be the next Oprah, for all he knows, but he's never even seen the show."
scooby,"I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct."
scooby,"But I'd like to be, you know...famous. Not necessarily a superstar, just famous. Be recognized. Get fan Mail. Things..."
scooby,He did?
scooby, Oh.
mikey,Mom? Dad? Can I sleep with you? I'm scared.
marty,Sure!...
fern,"Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on."
marty,"Snug as a bug in a rug. Yeah, here you go, pal. All righty...You're monster-proofed!"
scooby,Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
