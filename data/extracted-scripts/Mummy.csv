Speaker,Dialogue
narrator,Thebes. City of the Living. Crown jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First.
narrator,"Home of Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris, Keeper of the Dead."
narrator,Birthplace of Anck-su-namun. Pharaoh's Mistress. No other man was allowed to touch her.
narrator,"But for our love, we were willing to risk life itself."
pharaoh,What are you doing here?
pharaoh,WHO HAS TOUCHED YOU?!
pharaoh,Imhotep?... My priest.
priests,Pharaoh's bodyguards!
imhotep,"Her body was mummified, her vital organs removed and placed in sacred canopic jars."
imhotep,The Book of The Living contained sacred incantations that would send the evil dead on a journey into the dark underworld.
imhotep,The slaves were killed...
imhotep,"...and the soldiers who killed them were also slain, so that no unholy person should ever know the exact location of the burial site."
imhotep,"But there was another book, The Book Of The Dead, which was never to be opened, never to be read, for it contained the incantations that could bring a dead body back to life a most unholy thing."
imhotep,"It was hidden at Hamunaptra, City of the Dead, inside the statue of Anubis, so that no such sacrilege might ever disgrace Egypt."
imhotep,But for my love of Anck-su-namun I was willing to defy the gods.
imhotep,"Anck-su-namun's vital organs were still fresh, so a human sacrifice would not need be made."
imhotep,"Anck-su-namun soul had come back from the dead! Now all that was needed, was to return her organs to their rightful place within her body."
imhotep,My Priests were condemned to be mummified alive.
imhotep,"As for me, I was condemned to endure the HOM-DAI. The worst of all ancient curses. One so horrible, it had never before been bestowed."
imhotep,"By eating the sacred scarabs, I would be cursed to stay alive forever. And by eating me, they were cursed just the same."
imhotep,"I was to remain sealed inside my sarcophagus, the undead for all of eternity."
imhotep,"They would never allow me to be released. For I would arise a walking disease, a plague upon mankind, an unholy flesh-eater, with the strength of ages, power over the sands, and the glory of invincibility."
imhotep,"And if I could raise my beloved Anck- su-namun from her place in hell, together, we would be an unstoppable infection upon this world. The Apocalypse. The End."
beni,"Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?"
beni,Then let's run away. Right now. While we can still make it.
beni,"Then let's play dead, huh? Nobody ever does that anymore."
beni,In the desert? What for?
beni,"I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?"
beni,"Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?"
beni,What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
beni,Then what the hell are you doing here!?
evelyn,Tuthmosis?... Now how did you get up here?
evelyn,OHEIUGM!! AHHHHHH!
evelyn,Oops.
curator,"Look at this! Sons of the Messiah! Give me frogs, flies, locusts, anything but this! Compared to you, the other plagues were a joy!"
evelyn,"I'm sorry, it was an accident."
curator,"When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?"
evelyn,"You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library."
curator,"Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!"
evelyn,Hello?
evelyn,Abdul? Mohammed? Bob?
evelyn,You...! YOU...!
jonathan,Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
evelyn,Have you no respect for the dead?
jonathan,"Right now, I only wish to join them."
evelyn,"Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours."
jonathan,"My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note."
evelyn,"High note? Ha! For five years you've been scrounging around Egypt, and what have you to show for it? Nothing."
jonathan,Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
evelyn,"Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you."
evelyn,Where did you get this?
jonathan,"On a dig, down in Thebes."
jonathan,"My whole life I've never found anything, Evy. Tell me I've found something."
evelyn,Jonathan?
jonathan,Yes?
evelyn,I think you found something.
evelyn,"See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it."
curator,Perhaps.
jonathan,Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
evelyn,"He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all."
jonathan,"Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much."
evelyn,"I've already dated it, this map is almost four thousand years old. And the hieratics over here...  It's Hamunaptra."
curator,"My dear girl, don't be ridiculous, we are scholars, not treasure hunters. Hamunaptra is a myth."
jonathan,Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?
evelyn,Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
jonathan,"Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes."
evelyn,"All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C."
curator,As the Americans would say: it's all fairy tales and hokum.
jonathan,You burned it! You burned off the part with the lost city!
curator,"It's for the best, I'm sure. Many men have wasted their lives in the foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra, no one has ever found it, most have never returned."
jonathan, You killed my map.
curator,"I'm sure it was a fake, anyway, I'm surprised at you, Miss Carnarvon, to be so fooled."
evelyn,You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
jonathan,I was mistaken.
evelyn,You lied to me!
jonathan,"I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?"
evelyn,I'm your sister.
jonathan,That just makes you more gullible.
evelyn,You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
jonathan,"Picked his pocket, actually."
evelyn,And what is he in prison for?
warden,"I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself."
evelyn,And what did he say?
warden,He said... he was just looking for a good time.
evelyn,But he's just a filthy criminal?
jonathan," Way to go, Evy."
evelyn,Broad?!
jonathan,"She's my sister, actually."
warden,I'll be back in a moment.
evelyn,"We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it."
evelyn,No?
evelyn,How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
jonathan,How do we know that's not a load of pig swallow?
jonathan,"Um, well, you see..."
evelyn,You were actually at Hamunaptra?
evelyn,"Yes, well...  I know my brother."
evelyn,You swear?
evelyn,"No, I mean --"
evelyn,What did you find? What did you see?
evelyn,Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
evelyn,Yes.
evelyn,Yes.
evelyn,Where are they taking him?
warden,To be hanged.
warden,"Apparently, he had a very good time."
warden,No women allowed.
evelyn,I am an English woman.
evelyn,I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
warden,I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
evelyn,Two hundred pounds.
warden,Proceed!
evelyn,Three hundred pounds!
hangman,"Any last requests, pig?"
evelyn,FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS!
warden,And what else?
evelyn,NOOO!
warden,His neck did not break! Good! Now we watch him strangle to death.
evelyn,He knows the location to Hamunaptra.
warden,You lie.
evelyn,I would never!
warden,Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
evelyn,"Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent."
warden,Fifty percent.
evelyn,Twenty.
warden,Forty.
evelyn,"Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more."
curator,She must die.
hook,She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
curator,No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
curator,"Not only does she have a map, but she has the key."
hook,The key!? She has the lost key!?
curator,"Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all."
hook,"Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her."
curator,And burn the map and retrieve the key.
hook,It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
curator,"Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?"
beni,"It is three days down the Nile, then two days by camel, sahibs."
daniels,"For all the money we're paying you, something better god-damned well be under that sand."
henderson,"""Hamunaptra,"" Daniels, that's all ya gotta keep sayin, to yourself, ""Hamunaptra."""
evelyn,Do you really think he'll show up?
jonathan,"Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word."
evelyn,"Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit."
evelyn,"Oh... um,... hello."
jonathan,"Smashing day for the start of an adventure, eh, O'Connell?"
burns,You're sure Hamunaptra is out there?
beni,"Along with the scorched bones of my entire garrison, sahib."
beni,"A thousand pardons, my good sahibs but there is much work to be done."
evelyn,"Mister O'Connell, can you look me in the eye, and guarantee me this is not some sort of flimflam? Because if it is, I'm warning you --"
jonathan,"Yes, yes, you're right, filthy, rude, a complete scoundrel, nothing to like there at all."
warden,A bright good morning to all.
evelyn,What are you doing here?
warden,"I have come to protect my investment, thank you very much."
jonathan,"Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player."
daniels,Never? What if I were to wager five hundred dollars says we get to Hamunaptra before you?
burns,"What makes you so confident, sir?"
henderson,We got us a man who's actually been there.
jonathan,"I say, what a coincidence, why --"
jonathan,-- whose deal is it? Is it my deal? I thought I just dealt?
evelyn,"The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners."
evelyn,If you call that a kiss.
evelyn,Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
evelyn,"Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?"
evelyn,"Ahmar is Ossirion. ""Passageway to the underworld"", actually."
evelyn,"I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit."
evelyn,You know your history.
evelyn,"By the way,... why did you kiss me?"
beni,My very good friend! What a surprise.
beni,"You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell."
beni,"Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way."
beni,"You never believed in Hamunaptra, O'Connell. Why are you going back? The devil himself lives out there."
beni,You always did have more balls than brains.
beni,Even?
hook,Where is the map?
hook,And the key? Where is the key?
hook,Then I'll find it myself.
evelyn,The map! We need the map!
evelyn,Oh that's comforting.
jonathan,EVY!!
jonathan,Hey that's mine --
evelyn,"Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it."
jonathan,Americans.
jonathan,I say! Good show!
jonathan,And did I panic?
jonathan,I think not.
beni,Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
jonathan,I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
jonathan,"Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?"
jonathan,"Never did like camels. Filthy buggers. They smell, they bite, they spit. Disgusting."
evelyn,Well I think they're cute.
jonathan,And you snore!
warden,I do not snore!
jonathan,All night you snored!
warden,I have never snored!
evelyn,Are you sure?
jonathan,What in bloody hell is this?
warden,Other seekers of Hamunaptra.
beni,"Good morning, my friend!"
daniels,"Well, what the hell we doin'?"
beni,"Patience, my good sahib, patience."
henderson,"First one to the city, O'Connell! Five hundred! Cash bucks!"
evelyn,For what?
daniels,"SEE YA THERE, O'CONNELL!"
jonathan,"Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?"
evelyn,"After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet."
beni,Fools.
daniels,Where'd all these camels come from?
beni,They belong to the dead. They will wait years for their masters to return before leaving.
jonathan,That thing gives me the creeps.
evelyn,"That ""thing"" gets me excited."
evelyn,"According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living."
evelyn,Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
evelyn,"Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years."
warden,Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
jonathan,And it stinks to high heaven in here.
evelyn,Cretins.
evelyn,"Oh my god, It's a preparation room."
evelyn,For entering the afterlife.
jonathan,"Mummies, my good son, this is where they made the mummies."
henderson,"Ya scared the bejeezus out of us, O'Connell."
daniels,"This here is our statue,... friend."
beni,"Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good."
jonathan,"Yes, me too."
evelyn,"Let's be nice, children, if we're going to play together, we must learn to share."
evelyn,"According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs.  Oh my."
jonathan,And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
jonathan,We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
evelyn,"Yes, if their Egyptologist hasn't already found it."
jonathan,"I say, what's our smelly little friend got himself up to?"
egyptologist,Seti was no fool.
henderson,"Yeah, sure..."
henderson,We'll let him open it.
jonathan,OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
evelyn,It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
jonathan,Still...
evelyn,You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
egyptologist,FENI!
evelyn,"Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus."
evelyn,"They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty."
jonathan,Well?... Who is it?
evelyn,'He that shall not be named.'
evelyn,Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
jonathan,"Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out."
evelyn,A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
evelyn,"The man on the barge. The one with the hook, he was looking for a key."
jonathan,Hey that's mine!
evelyn,What do you suppose killed him?
jonathan,Did you ever see him eat?
evelyn,How?
jonathan,Maybe this place really is cursed.
evelyn,You two!
evelyn,"No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe."
jonathan,Seagrams!
jonathan,"Well, he may have been a stinky fellow,... but he had good taste."
jonathan,Evy! Excuse me! But didn't the man just say -- !
beni,"Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!"
beni, Why do you like to fight so much?
jonathan,"Let 'em have it, boys!"
jonathan,"I say, bloody good show."
ardeth ray,LEAVE THIS PLACE!... LEAVE THIS PLACE OR DIE!
evelyn,"Yes,... fine,... thank you."
daniels,See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
henderson,"For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there."
evelyn,Where's Jonathan?
evelyn,"Unlike my brother, sir, I know when to say no."
evelyn,"I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?"
evelyn,"Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself"
evelyn,"I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am."
evelyn,...I am a librarian!
evelyn,"I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell."
evelyn,I'm not?
evelyn,Why would I do that?
evelyn,I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
jonathan,"Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there."
evelyn,"Well neither do I, thank you."
evelyn,No... Why?... Should I?
egyptologist,There is a curse upon this chest.
daniels,Curse my ass.
henderson,"Yeah, who cares."
egyptologist,"In these hallowed grounds, that which was set forth in ancient times, is as strong today, as it was then."
henderson,"Yeah, yeah, okay, what's it --"
egyptologist,"""Death will come on swift wings to whomever opens this chest""."
egyptologist,"It says, there is one, the undead, who if brought back to life, is bound by sacred law to consummate this curse."
henderson,"Yeah, well, let's just make sure we don't bring anybody back from the dead then, huh?"
egyptologist,"He will kill all who open this chest,... and assimilate their organs and fluids."
daniels,Assimilate their organs and fluids? Ya mean eat 'em?
egyptologist,"And in so doing he will regenerate. And no longer be the undead, but a plague upon this earth."
henderson,"Ah hell, let's open it anyways."
evelyn,"Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl."
evelyn,"Look, all the sacred spells have been chiseled off. The hieratics and hieroglyphs that protect the deceased on his journey into the afterlife, they've been removed. This man was cursed,... doomed."
jonathan,"Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?"
beni,"The curse,... beware the curse!"
daniels,Stupid superstitious bastard.
evelyn,"No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still..."
jonathan,Juicy?
evelyn,Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
evelyn,"Oh my god, he was buried alive."
evelyn,And he left a message.
evelyn,It says: 'Death is only the beginning.'
jonathan,What are you going to do? Shoot him?
egyptologist,"I have heard told of this book, but I never truly believed it existed. This, good gentlemen, is a most priceless treasure."
henderson,I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
daniels,Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta pure gold!
jonathan,"What is this stuff? It smells like our late friend, the Warden."
jonathan,You did not!?... We're not!?
henderson,"Say O'Connell, whadaya think these honey's'll fetch back home?"
burns,We hear you gentlemen found yerselves a nice gooey mummy. Congratulations.
daniels,"Ya know if ya dry him out, you can sell him for firewood."
evelyn,"Scarabs, flesh eaters, I found them inside our friend's coffin. They can stay alive for years living off the flesh of a corpse, or in this case..."
evelyn,Famished.
evelyn,Very slowly.
jonathan,He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
evelyn,"According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed."
evelyn,"Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt."
beni,Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
evelyn,That's one way of putting it.
jonathan,"Let's see, there was frogs, flies, locusts..."
burns,Hail and fire.
henderson,The sun turning black.
daniels,Water turning to blood.
jonathan,And my personal favorite: people covered in boils and sores.
evelyn,Fried gizzard anyone?
evelyn,"It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book."
evelyn,Ahm kum Ra. Ahm kum Dei.
egyptologist,NO! NOOOO! YOU MUST NOT!
egyptologist,What have we done?
jonathan,Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
evelyn,This is not a plague. It's generational. Every so many years the locusts of Egypt have a population explosion and they all take flight.
burns,Daniels! Henderson!
burns,Daniels?... is that you?
burns,Henderson?
jonathan,EVY!?
evelyn,"Oh thank goodness, you're one of the Americans, aren't you?"
imhotep,Anck-su-namun?
henderson,"RUN, YOU SONS-A-BITCHES! RUUUUN!"
evelyn,"Help me,... please,... help me."
imhotep,Kadeesh pharos Anck-su-namun!
imhotep,ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!
ardeth ray,"I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years."
ardeth ray,No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
beni,May the good Lord protect and watch over me as a shepherd watches over his flock. And may Satan in all his forms be vanquished forever.
imhotep, The language of the slaves.
imhotep, I may have use for you. And the rewards will be great.
imhotep,Where are the other sacred jars?
daniels,You bastards!
henderson,What did you do to him!?
ardeth ray,"We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all."
jonathan,You're not going to kill us?
ardeth ray,"We must now hunt him down, and try and find a way to kill him, before he consumes the earth. Allah be with us."
ardeth ray,"Know this, the creature will be coming for you. He must consummate the curse. And until he does, he will never eat, he will never sleep, and he will never stop."
imhotep,ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!
evelyn,Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
evelyn,"No, we are not."
evelyn,"No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him."
evelyn,"Alright then, Me, I,... I read the book, I woke him up and I intend to stop him."
evelyn,Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
evelyn,"According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed."
evelyn, It's everybody's problem!
evelyn,That's what I am to you? A contract?
evelyn,I'm staying.
beni,You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
beni,"This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris."
beni,"The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid."
beni,He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
beni,Do you know where I can steal some?
winston,"I'm the last of the Royal Force still stationed here, you know? All the other laddies died in the air and were buried in the sand."
winston,"Ever since the end of the Great War, there hasn't been a single challenge worthy of a man like me."
winston,"I just wish I would've chucked it with the other laddies, gone down in a flame of glory, instead of sitting around here, rotting from boredom and booze!"
burns,"The drawer there, spectacles.  As you see, I won't be needing them."
beni,"Mister Burns, Prince Imhotep thanks you for your spectacles, -- and for your eyes,... and for your tongue."
beni,"But I am afraid more is needed, the Prince says he must finish the job, consummate the curse which you and your friends have brought down upon yourselves."
henderson,"Sweet Jesus! That tasted just like,... like..."
jonathan,"""And the rivers and waters of Egypt went red and were as blood."""
jonathan,Who's here!?
evelyn,The creature!? Are you sure!?
imhotep,"You saved me from the undead. For this, I shall make you immortal."
henderson,The curse. The curse.
evelyn,There's only one person I know who can possibly give us some answers.
everybody,YOU!
curator,Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
evelyn,What is he doing here?
curator,Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?
curator,You will not believe it.
curator,"We are part of an ancient secret society, the cult-of-the-Mumia, and we have a sacred mission, passed down through thirty-nine generations. For over four thousand years we have guarded The City Of The Dead. we are sworn at manhood to do any and all in our power to stop the High Priest Imhotep from being reborn into this world."
ardeth ray,"And because of you, we have failed."
evelyn, And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
curator,To have stopped this creature? Yes!
curator,"According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing."
daniels,Right! And ya know how he gets fully regenerated?! By killing everybody who opened that chest and sucking us dry! That's how!
curator,"Yes, the creature must first try and regenerate, and then he will attempt to resurrect the one he has loved for more than four thousand years."
evelyn,Anck-su-namun.
evelyn,"In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me."
curator,It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
jonathan,This is not good. Not good at all.
ardeth ray,Tonight is the full moon. The moon of Osiris. It will begin tonight.
jonathan,"""...and he stretched forth his hands towards the heavens, and there was darkness throughout the land of Egypt."""
evelyn,We must stop him from regenerating.
evelyn,Who opened that chest?
henderson,"Well, there was me and Daniels here and then poor Burns of course, oh yeah, and that Egyptologist fella."
daniels,"Naw, he scrammed outta there,"
evelyn,"We must find the Egyptologist and bring him back here to the safety of the fort, before the creature can get to him."
henderson,The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
daniels,"Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'."
evelyn,Who put you in charge? You can't just leave me behind like some old suitcase. I'm the one responsible for this mess and I intend to be the one to clean it up.
jonathan,Me?
beni,What friend? You're my only friend.
beni,"It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune."
beni,You shall see.
beni,The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
beni, And your sister.
jonathan,That looked rather painful.
jonathan,"Yes, I know, I do that to people."
jonathan,And then he'll be coming after Evy.
soldier,Ten o'clock! All is well!
daniels,"The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?"
henderson,"Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser."
evelyn,You called me your girl?
evelyn,I think you were jealous
daniels,"Shut-up! JUST SHUT-UP! We gotta do somethin'! we gotta do somethin, NOW! Before it's too late!"
evelyn,Last month I came across an inscription that mentioned The Book Of The Dead.
daniels,That book we found at Hamunaptra?
evelyn,"Yes. I dismissed it, because it talked about bringing people back from the dead. A notion I was unwilling to believe."
jonathan,And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
ardeth ray,"And if he succeeds, the two of them together will bring about the apocalypse."
the curator,"The plagues we have seen so far, are merely Imhotep flexing his muscles. Only at the moment of Anck-su-namun's resurrection will he be truly invincible."
evelyn,I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
curator,"-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld."
evelyn,Exactly --
curator,-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
curator,"Correct, And that's when --"
ardeth ray,It has begun. The beginning of the end.
evelyn,Not quite yet it hasn't. C'mon.
evelyn,Got it!
evelyn,"Since the black Book of The Dead was found inside the statue of Anubis, then according to this, the golden Book of The Living should be inside..."
jonathan,What?
daniels,WHAT!?
evelyn,"The golden Book Of The Living, is inside the statue of Horus."
curator,Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
curator,"If we want to kill the creature, yes."
jonathan,Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!
beni,Imhotep! IMHOTEP!
evelyn,He's gorgeous.
the curator,"He has consummated the curse, now all he need do is raise Anck-su-namun from the dead, then it will be the end of us, and the beginning for them."
imhotep,Koontash dai na.
beni,Take his hand and he will spare the others.
evelyn,Any bright ideas?
evelyn,I have no choice.
imhotep,"Keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan."
beni,"Come with me my princess. It is time to make you mine, forever."
evelyn,"All eternity, idiot."
evelyn,"You better think of something, because if he turns me into a mummy, you're the first one I'm coming after."
evelyn,"Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them."
jonathan,Hey that's mine -- !
ardeth ray,Be calm. There is still time. We can stop him yet.
imhotep,Pared oos.
evelyn,NOOO!!
beni,Kill them.
curator,Go! Find a way! Kill the creature!
jonathan,"I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it."
ardeth ray,Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
jonathan,And what ritual would that be?
ardeth ray,The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
jonathan,And how does one do that?
ardeth ray,By reading the Book Of The Dead.
jonathan,"Oh yes, of course."
ardeth ray,And then killing your sister.
jonathan,Excuse me?
ardeth ray,Imhotep is now able to cross the desert with great haste.
jonathan,"Begging your pardon, but I wasn't quite clear on that last part."
ardeth ray,"If he arrives before us, it will be too late."
jonathan,Did you say 'kill' my sister?
winston,So what's your little problem got to do with His Majesty's Royal Air Corp?
winston,Is it dangerous?
winston,"By Jove, do you really think so?"
jonathan,"Everybody else we've bumped into has died, why not you?"
winston,So what's the challenge then?
winston,"Winston Havlock at your service, sir!"
evelyn,What just happened?
beni,"All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing."
winston,"Hang on, men!"
winston,We're going down!
winston,"Here I come, laddies!"
evelyn,Stop it! You'll kill them!
jonathan,Excuse me... A little help would be useful... IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE!!
jonathan,He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
beni,Keep moving.
evelyn,"You know, nasty little fellows such as yourself, always get their comeuppance."
beni,Yeah?
evelyn,"Oh yes, always."
jonathan,"I say, look at that."
jonathan,"Say, gents! You should come have a look at this."
beni,Prince Imhotep wants your heart.
evelyn,"Tell him, I'm truly flattered... but that it's already taken."
beni,"He wants your heart and your brain, your liver, your kidneys..."
beni,"...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?"
evelyn,Intestines.
beni,Yeah! Them.
evelyn,You only want me for my organs?!
ardeth ray,Priests. Imhotep's priests.
ardeth ray,"They are evil, cursed, they matter not."
imhotep, Kill them! Kill them all! And bring me the Book Of The Living!
ardeth ray,My turn.
ardeth ray,I'm out.
jonathan,There he is!
jonathan,Hello Horus old boy.
ardeth ray,Allow me.
ardeth ray,Keep digging!
ardeth ray,Save the girl! Kill the creature!
imhotep,"With your death, my love and I will be invincible!"
jonathan,"I found it, Evy! I found it"
evelyn,Shut-up and get me off of here!
evelyn,"Open the book, Jonathan! Open the book! That's the only way to kill him!"
jonathan,I can't open it! It's locked or something!
jonathan,We need the key!
jonathan,"What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?"
evelyn,Read the inscription on the cover!
jonathan,"Keetash-something, naraba-something."
jonathan,Ebarra im hatu Kashka ummmmm -- ?
jonathan,Rasheem Aaaaa ANUBIS!
jonathan,Oh boy.
jonathan,You have got to be joking?
evelyn,"Finish the inscription, idiot!"
jonathan,Oh.
jonathan,"Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?"
evelyn,What's it look like!?
jonathan,"It's an Anck symbol, with two little squiggly lines above it, and a bird, a stork! on either side."
evelyn,Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
jonathan,"Yes,... I see."
jonathan,Hootash im Ahmenophus!
jonathan,I got it!
evelyn,Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal! Pared oos! PARED OOS!!
