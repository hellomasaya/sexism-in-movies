cassidy,That's funny.
randy,Doctor says I can't wrestle no more.
cassidy,Damn. What are you gonna do?
randy,I don't know. I don't know what to do. If I can't wrestle...
cassidy,It just happened. You don't have to figure everything out this second. Give yourself some time.
randy,Time's all I got. I just sit there all day...
cassidy,You really shouldn't be alone right now.
randy,That's why I came to see you.
cassidy, Randy...
randy,We don't really get along too good.
cassidy,It doesn't matter. You need her.
randy, She don't need me.
cassidy,Everybody needs a father. Trust me.
randy,I'm Randy The Ram. I've taken bigger bumps than this.
cassidy,I'm sure.
randy,Maybe I'll give my daughter a call.
cassidy,You should.

stephanie,Left at the second stop sign.
randy,"Yes, ma'am!"
stephanie,You gonna talk?
randy,There's something I wanted to tell you.
stephanie,Okay...
randy,I had a heart attack.  Last week.
stephanie,You are such an asshole.
randy, Why?
stephanie,Now you wanna fix things. Now that suddenly you're all scared and alone from your heart attack.
randy,What? No. It's not like----
stephanie,"This is so fuckin' you. You only come around when you need something from somebody, when they can do something for you. Selfish fuck. Good. Be alone."
randy,What are you doing?
randy,Why not?
scott brumberg,Heard you collapsed at the DiFusco show. Sounded pretty scary.
randy,Sold the shit outta that one.
scott brumberg,No way!
randy,I gotta give credit. DiFusco came up with the idea. We're setting up an angle for a grudge match.
scott brumberg,"Wow... Dude, you are good."
randy,What minivan?

cassidy,That's a great idea!  What's she into?
randy,I'm not sure.
cassidy,How old is she?
randy,"22, 23? "
cassidy,What kind of music does she like?
randy,I don't know.
cassidy,Is she into books? Cooking?
randy,I'm a shitty fuckin' father.
cassidy,"She's 22? Okay...  You should get her some clothes, some kinda clothes... All girls like that."
randy,That could work.
cassidy,I know the perfect place. This kick- ass little vintage shop in Westfield.
randy,Yeah?
cassidy,"Saturday's the best time to go. That's when they get the new stuff in, all these boxes full of great shit."
randy,Okay. Cool.
cassidy,I'll write it down.
randy,Good tip. Thanks.
cassidy,You got it.
randy,I'm gonna grab a drink at the bar.
cassidy,Listen...
randy,Yeah?
cassidy," I'm actually gonna be running around right in that area anyway, so it's not really a pain."
randy,All right. Thanks.
cassidy,No problem. You got it.

randy,What is it?

randy,That's the only thing you got?
wayne,At the moment. You interested?
randy,Hey.
cassidy,"""Clean""?"
randy,Like classy.
cassidy,"Gee, thanks."
randy,"Nah, nah, I don't mean that bad. I like it.  It's like in ""Grease"", where she turns into the hot rock `n' roll chick at the end. Except backwards."
cassidy,Oh-kaay...
randy,"So, uh... Should I call you Cassidy or Pam?"
cassidy,Pam.  But don't get used to it.
randy,This is awesome...  We are gonna find something great!
cassidy,Do you know her size?
randy,"She's kinda skinny, a little shorter than you."
cassidy,Could you see her in this?
randy,Maybe.  I'm not sure.
cassidy,What about this?
randy,Not really...
cassidy,Yeah?
randy,Thank you very much.
cassidy,You're welcome.
randy,I think she might be a lesbian.
randy,"Ah, maybe she's just a friend."
cassidy, This?
randy,It's perfect.
cassidy,I agree.
randy,Thanks again.
cassidy,You found it.
randy,I never woulda known about this place.
cassidy,"Okay, I'll give you that."
randy,"Man, I worked up a pretty good thirst in there. What say we grab a beer?"
cassidy,I gotta get going.
randy,One beer! We gotta re-hydrate!
cassidy,I really can't.  I got a kid at home.
randy,You have a kid?
cassidy,Boy. Daniel.
randy,How old?
cassidy,Nine.
randy,Wow... I had no friggin' idea.
cassidy,It's not something I usually tell customers. Not exactly a turn-on.
randy,Wait.
cassidy,That's very nice of you. Thank you.
randy,Tell him to take good care of that. $300 bucks on eBay.
cassidy,Really?
randy,Nah.
cassidy,One beer.
randy,He's a good-lookin' kid.
cassidy,I think so.
randy,I see where he gets it from.
cassidy,He sure doesn't get it from his douchebag father.
randy,What's that?
cassidy,"Just this condo thing, down by Trenton."
randy,You moving there?
cassidy,Working on it.  It's a great area. Way cheaper. And the schools are awesome.
randy,What about Cheetah's?
cassidy,I'm done. I'm quitting.
randy, Okay...
cassidy,Where?
randy,Right here.
cassidy,This isn't a dance place.
randy,Who cares? Fuckin' Def Lep!
cassidy, I've danced to this plenty.
randy,Fine. Then I'm dancing for you.
cassidy,Is this a lapdance I'm getting?
randy,Just sit back and enjoy.
cassidy,I think we can get you a shift.
randy,"Take a bottle, shake it up/ Break the bubble, break it u-up...  Pour some sugar on me! In the name of love!"
randy,They don't make `em like they used to.
cassidy,"Fuckin' eighties, man. Best shit ever."
randy,"Def Lep, Gunners..."
cassidy,The Cre...
randy,Then that Cobain pussy had to come around and ruin it all.
cassidy,Like there's something wrong with having a good time.
randy,"Fuckin' mopey douchebag.  ""Ooh, look at me! I wear flannel! I'm all depressed!"""
cassidy,"""I'm from Seattle! I like rain!"""
randy,Nineties fuckin' sucked.
cassidy,No shit...
randy,You're right. My bad.
cassidy,Shit.
randy,What's up?
cassidy, I totally didn't realize the time.
randy,We just got here.
cassidy,I should get home.
randy,C'mon. You said one beer!
cassidy,Good night.
randy,I thought it was gonna say Randy.
randy,Do I really even need to wear one?
wayne, Are you gonna be interacting with our valued Shop-Rite customers?
randy,"Yeah, but I----"
wayne,Then yes.
randy,Could they maybe re-do it?
wayne,Just wear the fucking thing.
randy,Seventeen.

randy,"I was looking in this store and saw it, and I just said, ""That is it."""
stephanie,What am I doing?
randy,Got any time? I was thinking we could swing by our old favorite spot.
stephanie,We have an old favorite spot?
randy,You'll remember when you see. Whaddaya say?
stephanie,Now's not the best time. I've got some things to do.
randy,What kinda things?
stephanie,Stuff.
randy,"You ain't got stuff!  C'mon, give an old man a break."
randy,You really don't remember?
stephanie,No.
randy,Guess you were pretty young.
stephanie, Always was a glutton for punishment.
randy,You'd hop on my foot and wrap your arms around my leg. I'd have to walk you the whole way through like that.
stephanie,I totally don't remember.
randy, I do.
randy,I accept your apology.
stephanie,Thank you.
randy,"I was young. My career was booming. All those lights, the fans, the crazy shit on the road... I wasn't thinking about my kid. Or my wife."
randy,Hope that wasn't too painful.
stephanie,It was okay.
randy,Well...
stephanie,Bye.
randy,So... How about dinner sometime?

randy,What if I do?
cassidy,I can't go there.
randy,What about the other day?
cassidy,That was a mistake.
randy,Why? How?

cassidy,We didn't.
randy,But what if we did?
cassidy,We didn't.
randy,What if we did?
cassidy,We didn't.
