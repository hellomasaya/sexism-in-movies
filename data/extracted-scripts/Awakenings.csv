4.,"4.   INT. CLASSROOM - DAY - 1930 An adult hand chalking the words of a poem on a blackboard. Children at desks dutifully transcribing the lesson. All but one. Leonard. Whose hands are trembling slightly and whose paper is blank. There is a noticeable lack of rhythms. A cold silence. The broken watch rests on his desk. The boy from the train, glancing at Leonard, begins gently tapping the end of his pen against his desk. Leonard, ""guided"" by the cadence of his friend's tapping, begins to write."
5.,"5. INT. CLASSROOM.- LATER - DAY - 1930 The finished poem on the blackboard. The sounds of children at play on the schoolyard. The teacher, alone in the classroom,"
kaufman,"It can't. SAYER Well, I know that now.       I proved it. The director offers a slow tentative nod before consulting the resume again. DIRECTOR Maybe before. At Saint Thomas.  Are they? SAYER Oh, yes . . . three years. As the Director retreats back to the resume, hoping against hope of finding in it something germane, Sayer glances away to a window. He wishes he were outside it. He has no business being here. He should leave. SAYER Excuse me, I made a mistake coming here. Clearly you're looking for someone with more of a clinical background. He stands up to leave. Kaufman stands to see him out.      But the       * director keeps searching the resume."
director,"Well, there we are, doctor. Kaufman can't believe it, but is sent back a look that says, We have no choice. The Director gets up out of his chair, and, smiling broadly, extends his hand to Sayer. Which unsettles Sayer. Which in turn unsettles the Director. DIRECTOR  You do want the job, don't you? Sayer isn't so sure.   He thinks about it long and hard . . ."
v,"11.   INT. DAYROOM  - DAY                                  11. A man in his sixties confronts Sayer with an announcement in a loud commanding voice - MALE PATIENT 1 X was born in I911f in Kinasbridae, New York. I came here in July of 1955. Prior to July of 1955. I resided a the Brooklyn Psychiatric Centerf Brooklyn. New York. Prior to thatP I was a person. And you. sir.- i Who the* hell >are.*v.ou?       ."
16,"16.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM/OFFICE - BAINBRIDGE - DAY Distant music of children's laughter. Perhaps real, emanating from outside; perhaps imagined, remembered, playing in a remote region of the woman's damaged mind. Arrested of all movement, she stares, transfixed, at the blades of a fan. SAYER'S VOICE Do you know where you are? . SAYER'S VOICE Can you hear me? Sayer, wearing a white lab coat, tries to read her eyes. Behind thick lenses, uncleaned for weeks or months, the eyes are inscrutable.                                         ."
miss costello,"And that I'll look after things for you until you've ""settled in."" Good night, doctor. She leaves. He stares blankly out after her, then at his dashboard. To it eventually, quietly -- SAYER Thank you . . . He glances to his rear view mirror and can see her walking away toward her car. To the reflection -- SAYER Thank you very much."
rev. 10/13/89   p. 17,"He glances around. Sees an orderly reading a newspaper. (P\   Borrows a section, returns with it, slides it under the pen and waits. The man doesn't write. Doesn't move. Sayer takes the pen back, returns it to his coat pocket, hesitates, pulls it out again, holds it out . . . and lets it go. The man, lightning quick, catches it."
28,"28.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - LATER - DAY The files spread out on a table. Sayer and Miss Costello leafing through them.                    . . Sayer considers one's original admission forms. He scans bodies of text and finds a diagnosis -- ATYPICAL SCHIZOPHRENIA. He sets it aside and picks up another. MISS COSTELLO ""Atypical Hysteria,"" this one. Sayer nods to himself and keeps reading his. He eventually finds in its text -- ATYPICAL RABIES. He flips to the end of the file. ""No change since last examination"" it reads. He turns the page. ""No change, no therapy recommended."" He turns the page, the last entry. ""No change."" The date, ""11/9/44."" SAYER There must be more recent files we missed somehow. ""Part Twos"" to their medical histories.  In some other filing cabinet somewhere.                 . .. MISS COSTELLO NO."
rev. 10/13/89   p.19,"29.   EXT. PARKING LOT - BAINBRIDGE - EVENING                               29.  Tea? SAYER Ah . . . normally I'd say yes . . . only I've made other plans . . . She nods quickly.    She seems, strangely, relieved. MISS COSTELLO Some other time. SAYER Yes. MISS COSTELLO , Good night. SAYER Good night. They veer apart to their respective cars."
41,"41.   INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - LATER - DAY Sayer has assembled them all, the fourteen or fifteen he has decided are post-encephalitics, and wanders among them like a naturalist in a garden of stone. He lifts an arm of one particularly remote male patient.   It remains suspended, doll-like. He tries to follow the trajectory of another's gaze.   It leads only to blank space. He considers another who appears ""deeply involved"" in some minute and curious activity with his twisted hands, a kind of tearing, shredding motion. .                       v Across the room, paying no attention to Sayer, are Sidney and Lolly. He's gently brushing her hair. Sayer manages a pen into the hand of another woman and she ""draws"" a kind a kind of circular shape that spirals in on itself until it reaches a ""vanishing point"" in the center."
rev. 10/13/83   p.26,"Sayer keeps coming back to one in particular. Unlike the others which, if you use your imagination, vaguely correspond somewhat positionally to the pre-printed shapes, this one bears no resemblance. This patient has instead scrawled over the shapes, seemingly violently. Miss Costello joins Sayer and ponders it along with him. Eventually, as if to excuse it and its maker-- MISS COSTELLO It's different. SAYER Quite.   It's quite bad. Sayer keeps studying it. SAYER  Could it be willfully bad? She doesn't say it but it's clear she thinks Sayer is reading far too much into the ""badness"" of the patient's scrawl. To himself - SAYER Which one is this? He leans closer to see the typed name . . ."
rev. 10/13/89 p.28,"MRS. LOWE  Well it's abstract, isn't it. Sayer can't bring himself to agree with her. MRS. LOWE That's the problem with all you doctors, you have no imagination. Everything has to be real to you. No longer having any use for him, she pointedly ignores him. * Taking the hint, Sayer's wanders off, past Lucy, looking like a statue, holding the paper cup he brought her."
mann,"What are you saying? When he's awake, what, he's dreaming? SAYER When there's any brain activity at all, which is infrequent, yes. Dreaming or hallucinating. MANN And when he's asleep . . . ? SAYER When he's asleep he manages to create a kind of reality. What we might call reality. MANN That's what you think these say? SAYER 1 don't know. Mann studies the ""waking"" EEC     He points to its one and only large electrical peak.                     ;"
mann,"What's this peak? Strobe? SAYER No. This is the strobe. Sayer indicates a flat section of the pattern where there is scribbled in pencil a small ""s."" SAYER This . . . ,                               / . . . is me saying his name to him. Mann stares rather dumbly at Sayer. Then at Hank the monkey on the floor dealing solitaire."
rev. 10.13/89 p.33,"A circle of patients in wheelchairs. The post-encephalitics reunited. ""Waking"" just long enough to catch and release the object, a small beach ball. Leonard and Sayer, on opposite sides of the circle, ignoring the ball and the other patients. He's reached a dead end, Sayer, right where he began, his only ""accomplishment,"" this, ball-catching patients."
rev. 10/13/89   p.34,"Sayer doesn't know whether to applaud or cry. He does neither, burying his emotions behind a professional mask instead, and watches as Lucy, ""delivered"" to the other side, free now, lets the regularity of the pattern guide her toward the fountain. She nears it. She is almost there. Then she is. there. But doesn't drink. Doesn't stop. She continues past it . . . To a window, the window bevond the drinking fountain which Sayer hadn't noticed before, had no reason to notice, had no need to notice, with a broken pane allowing a view to the outside. She stares out at the traffic below, in hopes no doubt of figuring out where she is. And Sayer's eyes, behind which exhilaration and horror rise up, shift from her to Miss Costello, and then to Leonard, in whose mask of a face Sayer thinks he sees a faint glimmer. These people are alive inside."
52,"52.   INT. DAYROOM , a first edition worn /rom many readings. Margaret glances from it to the other nurses and back to Miss Costello."
54,"54.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY Leonard's head locked on his shoulders at an improbable angle that forces his entranced gaze upward to a point well above Sayer. SAYER Can you hear me, Leonard? I want to hear you speak your name. : .               - Sayer waits . . . but Leonard remains mute."
margaret,"They'll sit there all day like that if I let them. I have to play the first card. > Sayer watches her pull a card from one of their hands and place it on the table. All three ""wake"" and begin throwing down cards, one after another. SAYER Is it a real game I wonder? MARGARET If it is, I don't know it. Maybe it's three different games. SAYER  Yes. 62"
rev. 10/13/89   p.40,"But the pointer is moving again.      It stops on the ""L."" SAYER Yes. Yes. That's what I meant. . ""L."" Good. Now the ""E."" It begins moving again. But not to the ""E."" To the nK,"" where it hesitates briefly before moving again. SAYER  . . . you're spelling something el e . . . s Keeping one hand on the moving pointer, Sayer fumbles a pen from his shirt pocket and scribbles on his lab coat what Leonard has and is continuing to ""write"": RILKESPA"
"rev. 10/13/89 p.""","(continuity onxy; SAYER'S VOICE ""His gaze from staring through the bars has grown so weary that it can take in nothing more . . ."
rev. 10/13/89 p.41a, in the air.
rev. 10/13/89   p.47,"SAYER I hope it'll bring him back from wherever he is.  What's here for him after all these years?       ' SAYER You are here. She ponders that and the enormity of the whole situation, all the while staring at the consent form."
79,"79.   INT. PHARMACY, BAINBRIDGE - DAY The hospital pharmacy, a subterranean structure built into the basement, cluttered from floor to ceiling with medicines. Ray, the pharmacist, dips into a bag of powder. He spoons some out onto a scale and looks to Sayer to tell him the dosage. SAYER I have no idea. What do you say we ease into it with ... what,       . fifty milligrams? Ray begins to measure five milligrams. SAYER Let's say a hundred. Ray shrugs; it's okay with him. He knifes at the powder, removing all but 100 milligrams."
rsv. 10/13/89   p.48,"SAYER Leonard? Your mother's going to give you some juice. There's medicine in it which is why it may taste more bitter than usual. Sayer glances to Mrs. Lowe. It's as if they've rehearsed it all. She holds the glass to her son's lips and gradually drains the liquid down his throat. Nothing immediately happens, of course, but they all, with the exception of Leonard, look as if they expect it to. Mrs. Lowe hands the empty glass back to Sayer. And they all wait."
9,"90.   INT. DAYROOM - LATER - NIGHT A claw of a hand dragging a crayon across a sheet of paper. Tight on Sayer, framed in a doorway, as still and silent and entranced as a post-encephalitic. His perspective of the dayroom -- deserted except for a figure, a patient, Leonard, hunched over the table. As Sayer crosses toward him, Leonard's head slowly rises. Sayer sits opposite him and they consider each other in silence for several moments. Leonard struggles to speak, to form words. They come out in a halting cadence, flat, without inflection, and are only barely . recognizable as words:                   . LEONARD It's quiet. SAYER It's late.    Everyone's asleep> LEONARD I'm not asleep? SAYER No.   You're awake. Though he nods, it's unclear whether Leonard realizes how significant that is. Sayer gestures at the piece of paper beneath Leonard's hands. SAYER May I? Sayer draws the paper across the table. It's covered with what seems imponderable hieroglyphic-like scrawl. But there is order in the chaos. Letters. Leonard's name. LEONARD Me."
93.,"9.3.   INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR - MORNING Miss Costello, flanked by Sayer and Mrs. Lowe, watches as Leonard extends his hand to the ""card playing nurse."" MARGARET How do you do, sir? My name is Margaret. LEONARD Margaret."
9,"95.   INT. THE PHARMACY - MORNING Fernando is along for the ride and watches Leonard shaking Ray the pharmacist's hand. RAY How do you do, Mr. Lowe? LEONARD ! Good, sir."
95,"95A. INT. CAFETERIA KITCHEN -MORNING The cooks and kitchen workers around Leonard and his entourage, shaking his hand. >.                . 96. INT. STAFF CAFETERIA - LATER - DAY                            9 A tray of truly awful cafeteria food. The group, minus Sayer and Miss Costello, watches Leonard dip a fork into some mush- like concoction and manipulate it, with difficulty, to and into his mouth. He seems amazed by its flavor. LEONARD It's delicious. FERNANDO I wouldn't go that far, Len. Sayer and Miss Costello, at another table, glance over to the others who are all laughing. Sayer smiles. MISS COSTELLO I don't think I could deal with losing 3D years of my life. I can't even imagine it."
rev. 10/13/89 p.53,"Sayer's smile fades. The possibility that Leonard might not have realized the extent of the passage of time had not, until this moment, occurred to him. He stares blankly at Miss Costello. MISS COSTELLO He does realize it, doesn't he? Sayer nods uncertainly. SAYER He must."
97.,97.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - LATER - DAY  Sayer demonstrates a clapping motion. Leonard repeats it more slowly but with decent motor control.
re v. 10 /1 3/ 89   p .54,"L EO N AR D I ' m af r ai d to cl os e m y ey e s . . . If (y\              I close my eyes . . . He hesitates, as if saying it may make the fear more real. SAYER . . . you'll sleep. And when you wake up in the morning, it will be the next morning. I promise. Sayer's smile tries to assure them both that it will happen just that way. He excuses himself, leaving Leonard with his mother, joins Miss Costello by the door and glances back. Mrs. Lowe is stroking Leonard's head as she hums a lullaby."
rev. 10/13/89 p.55a, LEONARD I'd like to go outside.
109,"109.   EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY A 747 roaring down a runway. At the edge of it, it lifts off and thunders over Sayer and Leonard and the parked Toyota. Exhilerated, Leonard waves. The music CONTINUES OVER: 110.   OMITTED                                                    110 111.   EXT. THE BRONX / CITY ISLAND - DAY                         111 An expressway. The Toyota traveling at ""astounding"" speed, passing a sign that reads CITY ISLAND."
r!v. 10/13/89   p.58,Boats and fish markets and lush vegetation. Paradise compared to the Bronx. The Toyota turns down a side road near the water         t and into the driveway of Sayer's small wooden house. w   '..                     .         ' And the mus ic ends.
rev. 10/13/89   p.59,"As Leonard considers each pair of glasses ... SAYER Those are my normal interior glasses. And spare pair. Those, I wear outside. Two pairs, in case I los.e one. Those, those are my daytime reading glasses. And spare. Those are for close work. For fine print. Those are my nighttime reading glasses -"

rev. 10/13/89 p.60,"SAYER I can date my interest in science precisely, actually.

sayer,"We should be getting back. Sayer crosses over to the sideboard, to the pairs of glasses, stares at them for several moments, and picks up two pairs. 114.

Climbing out of his car, Kaufman sees Sayer striding toward him. He glances to the sky, Kaufman, to God, and silently complains to Him. '4 115.   INT. STAFF CAFETERIA, BAINBRIDGE - LATER - DAY                115 Cafeteria workers carting serving trays back to the kitchen. Nurses and orderlies and office workers at tables with finished' meals and cups of coffee. They seem unaware of Drs. Sayer and Kaufman at a table near the door. KAUFMAN z^                   When you say expensive, what are we talking about?"
sayer,"Isolated circumstances -- the mention of his name, notes of particular pieces of music, the touch of another human being -- managed on occasion to briefly summon him, but these awakenings were rare and transient, lasting only a moment or two. Sayer glances to Miss Costello.   She nods, ""Good, that's better."" SAYER The rest of the time he remained in a profoundly eventless place ~ deprived of all sense of history and happening and self -- encysted, cocooned, enveloped in this metaphorical if not physiological equivalent of sleep . . . or death. Tight on the screen, on Leonard, as he was. Looking more like a photograph of a man than a motion picture of one. SAYER This was his condition when first seen by me in a remote bay of this hospital. And the quality of his life for the last 30 years. The ""before picture"" of Leonard on the screen is replaced with the ""after"" -- his eyes alert, his hands exploring a desk microphone. He glances up and off at something. LEONARD  I'm back."
118.,"118.   INT. THE PHARMACY - DAY The raw L-Dopa powder, 20,000 dollars worth, has arrived. It sits on a pharmacy counter in large clear bags.

Moving slowly past the beds: A figure rediscovering the feeling of her skin; another, the sound of his breath; another,' the beating of her heart. A figure still asleep . . . wakes. And for the first time in nearly half a century sees herself in the world. Tight on Sayer, on the look of awe on his face as he stares at the scene going on in the darkened ward.

sayer,Stay there. I'm coming over. LEONARD'S VOICE Good.                          * Dial tone. Sayer listens to it a moment before slowly setting the receiver back on its cradle.

leonard,"I am?  It makes all the difference. He brushes at his brow again. Sayer studies him, or rather the tic itself as it repeats.

SAYER They said it's a dangerous place out there. They said they can't be held responsible for what might happen to you out there. They said no. Leonard nods, sips his coffee, seems to take the decision in stride. LEONARD And what did you say? SAYER They don't have to listen to me. LEONARD Did you agree with them?"
sayer, I have to be sure you're well. There'll be time enough - Leonard gets up out of his chair -- LEONARD Bye. -- and turns to leave. SAYER Leonard ... Leonard ignores him and walks out --      :

PAULA I know, I should do something with my life. LEONARD Like what? Those are great things. I've never done any of those things. PAULA You will. Leonard shakes his nead 'no.' LEONARD They'll never let me out of this place. They shouldn't. They consider each other for several moments -- the one, young and healthy; the other, old and ill. LEONARD I'm not well. I feel well inside when I see you. I wish you could see what's inside. Instead of this. PAULA I can see it. Silence. As much as Leonard wants to say ""I love you,"" he knows he cannot, that it would be ludicrous. Instead: LEONARD Goodbye. He ho lds out o ne of his sh aking han ds to her.

MISS COSTELLO It's given and taken away from all of us. On screen, Leonard buttons buttons on his shirt and glances up smiling, proud. Tight on sayer in the dark room, the projector light flickering behind him. More to himself -- SAYER Why doesn't that comfort me?"

LEONARD Am I speaking? SAYER O.S. Yes. Leonard's eyes drift to a chair, his mother's chair, the one she has used for thirty years. It's empty. SAYER O.S. Your mother is well. She's home.

It's magical.- At *least as-seen, through .Leonard's eyes. From the promenade he watches the skaters gliding gracefully over the ice. Hector appears at his side. HECTOR                 : I ' m sorry to bother you, Len, I just thought you should know this is adding up, you know? Without taking his eyes from the skaters below, Leonard digs into his coat pocket and hands Hector a clump of money, hundreds of dollars. Embarrassed - HECTOR I didn't mean that, just - LEONARD I don't need it, you keep it. Hector puts the money back in Leonard's coat. Leonard finds Paula among the skaters, isolates her from them, and watches her glide around the rink. A fine mist of snow is falling, veiling her. HECTOR Beautiful, isn't it. LEONARD Unforgettable."
