Speaker,Dialogue
black screen," A desert wind moans sadly.  From somewhere within the wind comes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters singing ""My Favorite Things."" A series of sepia images of anti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after another on the screen.  In the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen.  A beat, and then it runs down and off revealing:  TITLE: ""He who makes a beast of himself Gets rid of the pain Of being a man."" Dr. Johnson  The VOICE OF HUNTER S. THOMPSON -- a.k.a. RAOUL DUKE:  DUKE  I remember saying something like: ""I feel a bit lightheaded.  Maybe you should drive...""  GONZO starts shaving. "
gonzo,What are you yelling about?
duke,Never mind.  It's your turn to drive.
radio news,An overdose of heroin was listed as the official cause of death for pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby whose body was found stuffed in a refrigerator last week...
gonzo,"""One toke over the line, sweet Jesus."""
duke, One toke.  You poor fool.  Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
gonzo,Let's give that boy a lift.
duke,We can't stop here - this is bat country!
hitchhiker,Hot damn!  I never rode in a convertible before!
duke,"Is that right?  Well, I guess you're about ready, eh?"
gonzo,We're your friends.  We're not like the others.
duke, No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
duke, Jesus!  Did I say that?
gonzo, It's okay.  He's admiring the shape of your skull.
duke, THERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD PROBABLY UNDERSTAND --
duke, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
duke,"That's good.  Because I want you to have all the background.  This is a very ominous assignment -- with overtones of extreme personal danger.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism! This is important, goddamnit!  This is a true story!... "
gonzo, Keep your hands off my fucking neck!
duke," I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip.  He's a foreigner.  I think he's probably Samoan.  But it doesn't matter, does it?  Are you prejudiced?"
hitchhiker,"Hell, no!"
duke,"I didn't think so.  Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me.  Hell, I forgot all about this beer.  You want one?  How about some ether?"
hitchhiker,What?
duke,Never mind.  Let's get right to the heart of this thing.  Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel...
duke,"I'm telling you, the Salazar story is getting too complicated.  The weasels have started closing in."
dwarf,"Perhaps this is the call you've been waiting for all this time, sir..."
duke,Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh...
dwarf,That was headquarters.  They want me to go to Las Vegas at once and make contact with a Portuguese photographer named Lacerda.  He'll have the details.  All I have to do is check into my sound proof suite and he'll seek me out.
gonzo,"God hell!  I think I see the pattern!  This one sounds like real trouble!  You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over.  As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine.  And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves."
duke,"Why not?  If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right."
duke,"I tell you, my man.  This is the American Dream in action!  We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end."
gonzo,Indeed.  We must do it.  What kind of story is this?
duke,The Mint 400!  The richest off-road race for motorcycles and dune- buggies in the history of organized sport!  -- a fantastic spectacle in honor of some fatback grossero who owns the luxurious Mint Hotel in the heart of downtown Vegas... at least that's what the press release says.
duke,We're going to have to drum it up on our own.  Pure Gonzo Journalism.
gonzo,"O.K., O.K., yes.  Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  What?!  OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card!  Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?"
duke,"Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment.  Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars."
gonzo,We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
duke,We will.  You Samoans are all the same.  You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
agent,"Say... uh... you fellas are going to be careful with this car, aren't you?"
duke,Of course.
agent,"Well, good god!  You just backed over that two foot concrete abutment and you didn't even slow down! Forty-five in reverse!  And you barely missed the pump!"
duke,No harm done.  I always test the transmission that way.  The rear end.  For stress factors.
agent,Say.  Are you fellows drinking?
duke,Not me.  We're responsible people.
gonzo,There's another worrier.  He's probably all cranked up on speed.
duke,...and we're chock full of that!
gonzo,Damn right!
duke,"My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?!"
gonzo,My heart!
duke,"The medicine?  Yes, it's right here."
duke,"Don't worry, this man has a bad heart... Angina Pectoris.  But we have a cure for it."
gonzo, Turn up the fucking music!  My heart feels like an alligator! Volume!  Clarity!  Bass!  We must have bass!  What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
duke, You scurvy shyster bastard!  Watch your language!  You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism!
gonzo, What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police!  We need help!
gonzo," The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry.  I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right?"
duke,And eat them!  That bastard won't get away with this!  What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
hitchhiker,Thanks for the ride.  Thanks a lot. I like you guys.  Don't worry about me.
duke, Wait a minute!  Come back and have a beer!
gonzo,"Good riddance.  That boy made me nervous.  Did you see his eyes?  Jesus, this is good medicine."
duke, Move over!!  We have to get out of California before that kid finds a cop!
gonzo,"Oh, Jesus!  Did you see what god just did to us?"
duke,"God didn't do that!  You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!"
gonzo, You better be careful.  Plenty of vultures out here.  They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
duke,You whore!
gonzo,Here -- chew this.  It's your half of the acid.
duke,How long do I have?
gonzo,"Maybe thirty more minutes.  As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed.  It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal.  Are you ready for that?  Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid."
duke,"I need this, right?"
attendant,I'll remember your face.
duke,"HI THERE.  MY NAME... AH, RAOUL DUKE... ON... ON THAT LIST, THAT'S FOR SURE.  FREE LUNCH, FINAL WISDOM, TOTAL COVERAGE... WHY NOT? I HAVE MY ATTORNEY WITH ME, AND I REALIZE OF COURSE..."
duke,"... THAT HIS NAME IS NOT ON THE LIST, BUT WE MUST HAVE THAT SUITE. YES.  JUST CHECK THE LIST AND YOU'LL SEE.  DON'T WORRY.  WHAT'S THE SCORE HERE?  WHAT'S NEXT?"
reservations clerk, Your suite's not ready yet.  But there's somebody looking for you.
duke, NO!  WHY?  WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING YET!
gonzo,"I can handle this.  This man has a bad heart, but I have plenty of medicine.  My name is Dr. Gonzo. Prepare our suite at once.  We'll be in the bar."
gonzo," Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?"
duke,Lacerda?
duke,"Order some golf shoes.  Otherwise, we'll never get out of this place alive.  It's impossible to walk in this muck -- no footing at all..."
gonzo,If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
gonzo,I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda.  I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer!  But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked!  He knows we're onto him!
duke,But what about our room?  And the golf shoes?
gonzo," That's the press table.  Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with.  You handle that, and I'll check on the room."
duke,"No, no.  Don't leave me!"
bell boy,"Four club sandwiches, four shrimp cocktails."
duke,There's a big... machine in the sky... some kind of electric snake...
bell boy,... a quart of rum...
duke,... coming straight at us.
gonzo,Shoot it.
duke,Not yet.  I want to study its habits.
bell boy,... and nine fresh grapefruit.
gonzo,Vitamin C.  We'll need all we can get.
gonzo,"Look, you've got to stop this talk about snakes and leeches and lizards and that stuff.  It's making me sick!"
duke,What are you talking about?
gonzo,"You bastard!  They'll never let us back in that place.  I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles!  You scared the shit out of those people!  They were ready to call the cops.  Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there..."
duke,Oh my God!  Who's that?!
lacerda,"Duke?  I'm Lacerda your photographer. Got your press passes?  Good, good. Too bad you missed the bikes checking in.  My, what a sight!"
lacerda,"Husquavarnas.  Yamahas.  Kawaskis. Maicos.  Pursang.  Swedish Fireballs. Couple of Triumphs, here and there a CZ.  All very fast.  What a race it's gonna be."
lacerda,"Well, we start at dawn.  Get a good night's sleep.  I know I will."
duke, That's good...
gonzo,I think he's lying to us.  I could see it in his eyes.
duke, They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
gonzo,Turn that shit off!
duke,"See...""Kill the body and the head will die""... the Frazier/Ali fight..."
magazine reporter,A proper end to the 60's... Ali beaten by a human hamburger!
duke,And both Kennedy's murdered by mutants.
reporter,That's it!  They're starting!
reporter,"Well, that's that.  They'll be back in an hour or so.  Let's go back to the bar."
voice off,Group 2!
voice off,Group 3!
duke,Beer!
hoodlum,God damn!  What day is this -- Saturday?
duke,More like Sunday.
hoodlum,"Hah!  That's a bitch, ain't it? Last night I was home in Long Beach and somebody said they were runnin' the Mint 400 today, so I says to my old lady, ""Man, I'm goin'."" So she gives me a lot of crap about it, so I start slappin' her around, and the next thing you know two guys I never seen before are beating me stupid."
voice off,Group 4!
hoodlum,"Then they gave me ten bucks, put me on a bus, and when I woke up here I was in downtown Vegas, and for a minute all I could think was, ""O Jesus, who's divorcing me this time?"" But then I remembered, by God!  I was here for the Mint 400. And, man, I tell you, it's wonderful to be here.  Just wonderful to be here with you people."
magazine reporter,Senzaman wassyneeds!
duke, Hell yes!  Bring us ten!
voice off,Group 5!
magazine reporter,"Listen, madam.  I'm damn near intolerably handsome down here where I am.  You'd go crazy if I stood up!"
lacerda,"Club soda, please."
lacerda," Man, it's great out there!"
duke,Lunatics.
voice off,Group 6!
lacerda,Meet you outside!
lacerda,"It's great, isn't it?!  Jump in!"
lacerda,I'll just keep trying different combos of film and lenses till I find one that works in this dust!
battle hymn,"""...As we go marching on When I reach my final campground, in that land beyond the sun, And the Great Commander asks me..."" [What did he ask you, Rusty?] ""Did you fight or did you run?"""
battle hymn," [And what did you tell them, Rusty?] ""We responded to their rifle fire with everything we had..."""
duke,Beats me.  We're just good patriotic Americans like yourself.
duke,The sporting press.  We're friendlies.  Hired geeks.
duke,"If you want a good chase, you should get after that skunk from CBS News up ahead in the black jeep. He's the man responsible for that book, THE SELLING OF THE PENTAGON."
duke,Take me back to the pits.
lacerda,"No, no -- we have to go on.  We need total coverage."
duke,You're fired.
duke,"Turn up the radio!  Turn up the tape machine!  Roll the windows down.  Let's taste this cool desert wind!  Aaah, yes!  This is what it's all about!"
gonzo,"How about ""Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?"" ""Hot Slots,"" that sounds heavy.  Twenty-nine cent hotdogs..."
duke,"Look, what are we doing here?  Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?"
gonzo,"To do the job, of course.  Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!"
gonzo,As your attorney I advise you to drive over to the Tropicana and pick up on Guy Lombardo.  He's in the Blue Room with his Royal Canadians.
duke,Why?
gonzo,Why what?
duke,"Why should I pay out my hard-earned dollars to watch a fucking corpse. I don't know about you, but in my line of business it's important to be Hep."
duke,Why not?  Is this not a reasonable place to park?
gonzo,We want this car parked!  We drove all the way from L.A. for this show. We're friends of Debbie's.
duke,Holy shit!  They almost had us there!  That was quick thinking.
gonzo,What do you expect?  I'm your attorney.  You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
gonzo,"Goddamnit, we drove all the way from L.A."
gonzo,Fuck seats!  We're old friends of Debbie's.  I used to romp with her.
gonzo,Jesus creeping shit!
duke, Did the mescaline just kick in?  Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
gonzo, We wandered into a fucking time capsule!
duke, We wandered into a fucking time capsule!
gonzo,What's this?...
gonzo,That scum...
gonzo,SCUM!  I know where you live!  I'll find you and burn down your fucking house!
duke,This is the place.  They'll never fuck with us here.
gonzo,Where's the ether?  This mescaline isn't working.
duke," Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine.  Watch out!... Why money?  My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?"
gonzo,Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep.
fairground barker,"Stand in front of this fantastic machine, my friend.  For just 99 cents your likeness will appear 200 hundred feet tall on a screen above downtown Las Vegas."
fairground barker,"99 cents more for a voice message. Say whatever you want, fella. They'll hear you, don't worry about that.  Remember, you'll be 200 feet tall!"
another barker,Step right up!  Shoot the pasties off the nipples of this ten-foot bull-dyke and win a cotton candy goat!
gonzo,"I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me.  I think I'm getting The Fear."
duke,"Nonsense.  We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve."
gonzo,That's what gives me The Fear.
duke,Look over there.  Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
gonzo,"Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink.  How much money can you lend me?"
duke,Not much.  Why?
gonzo,I have to go.
duke,GO?
gonzo,Yes.  Leave the country.  Tonight.
duke,Calm down.  You'll be straight in a few hours.
gonzo,No.  This is serious.  One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
duke,OK.  I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
gonzo,Can we make it?
duke,That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
gonzo,I want to leave fast.
duke,OK.  Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly.  It's going to be a long walk. 
gonzo, Do they pay you to screw that bear?
waitress,What?
duke,"He's just kidding.  Come on, Doc -- lets go downstairs and gamble."
gonzo,When does this thing stop?
duke,It won't stop.  It's not ever going to stop.
duke,Don't move you'll come around.
duke,You fell.  Let's go.
gonzo,Did you see that?  Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
duke,Probably the bartender.  He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
gonzo,Good God!  Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
duke, Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
duke,Don't run.  They'd like any excuse to shoot us.
gonzo, You drive!  I think there's something wrong with me.
gonzo,"Those bastards have changed the lock on us.  They probably searched the room.  Jesus, we're finished!"
gonzo,Bolt everything!  Use all chains!
gonzo,Where did this one come from?
duke,That's Lacerda's room.
gonzo,Yeah... I thought we might need it...
duke,What for?
gonzo,Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
duke,"No, we should leave the poor bastard alone.  I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason."
gonzo,Don't kid yourself.  That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous.  He's watching us like a hawk.
duke,He told me he was turning in early...
gonzo,That dirty bastard!  I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
duke, That little blonde groupie with the film crew?  You think he sodomized her?
gonzo,"That's right, laugh about it!  You goddamn honkies are all the same!"
duke,Where'd you get that knife?
gonzo,Room service sent it up.  I wanted something to cut the limes.
duke,What limes?
gonzo,They didn't have any.  They don't grow in the desert.
gonzo,That dirty toad bastard!  I knew I should have taken him out when I had the chance.  Now he has her.
gonzo,Class?  What the fuck do you mean?
gonzo,Use me?
gonzo, I ride the BIG ONES!  The really BIG fuckers!
duke,The Vincent Black Shadow.  We're with the Factory Team.
tv cameraman,Bullshit.
gonzo,"Wait a minute, pardon me lady, but I think there's some kind of ignorant chicken-sucker in this car who needs his face cut open.  You cheap honky faggots!  Which one of you wants to get cut?!"
gonzo,Spooked!  They were spooked!  Like rats in a death cage!
gonzo,Goddamn.  It's serious now.  That girl understood.  She fell in love with me.
gonzo,Let's go up there and castrate that fucker!
gonzo, Have you made a deal with him?  Did you put him on to her?
duke, Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight.  I have to put the car in the lot.
magazine reporter,"Las Vegas at dawn.  The racers are still asleep, the dust is still on the desert, fifty thousand dollars in prize money, slumbers darkly in the office safe at Del Webb's fabulous Mint Hotel..."
duke,You bastards!
duke,You ate ALL THIS ACID?
duke," You evil son of a bitch.  You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble."
gonzo,Music!  Turn it up.  Put that tape on.
duke,What tape?
gonzo,"Jefferson Airplane. ""White Rabbit."" I want a rising sound."
duke,You're doomed.  I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
gonzo,I dig my own graves.  Green water and the White Rabbit.  Put it on.
duke,"OK.  But do me one last favor, will you.  Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow.  I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day."
gonzo," Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?"
duke,How about a check?
gonzo,Whatever's right.
duke,"Shit, he's killing himself!"
gonzo, I want that fucking radio!
duke,Don't touch it!  Get back in that tub!
gonzo,"Back the tape up.  I need it again! Let it roll!  Just as high as the fucker can go!  And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!"
duke,Not me.  It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
gonzo,BULLSHIT!  Don't make me use this.
duke,Jesus.
gonzo,Do it!  I want to get HIGHER!
duke,"Okay.  You're right.  This is probably the only solution.  Let me make sure I have it all lined up.  You want me to throw this thing into the tub when ""WHITE RABBIT"" peaks.  Is that it?"
gonzo,Fuck yes.  I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it.
duke,Are you ready?
duke,MACE!  YOU WANT THIS?
gonzo,"You bastard!  You'd do that, wouldn't you?"
duke, Why worry?  You'll like it.  Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty-five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
gonzo,You cheap honky sonofabitch...
duke,"Why not?  Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me!  What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!"
gonzo,The cops?
duke,There's no choice.  I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
gonzo, Who said anything about slicing you up?  I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead.  Nothing serious.
duke," Get back in that tub.  Eat some reds and try to calm down.  Smoke some grass, shoot some smack -- shit, do whatever you have to do, but let me get some rest."
gonzo,"Hell, yes.  You really need some sleep.  You have to work.  Goddamn. What a bummer.  Try to rest.  Don't let me keep you up."
musician,What's the trouble?
duke," Well, all this white stuff on my sleeve is LSD."
bell boy,Room service!
duke, How would Horatio Alger have handled this situation?
clerk's voice,MR. DUKE!
clerk's voice,Mr. Duke!  We've been looking for you!
duke," Well, why not?  Many fine books have been written in prison."
clerk,"Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you.  It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'.  does that make sense?"
duke, Yes... It makes sense.
clerk,I checked the register for this man Thompson.  We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
duke,"He is.  Don't worry, I'll get it to him."
clerk,What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles.  When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
duke,You did the right thing.  Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
clerk,Tell me.  When will the doctor be awake?
duke, Awake?  What do you mean?
clerk," Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him.  Nothing unusual.  Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand."
duke,"Of course.  But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast.  He's a very crude man."
clerk,But he will be available?  Perhaps later this morning?
duke,"Look.  That telegram was all scrambled.  It was actually from Thompson, not to him.  Western Union must have gotten the names reversed.  I have to get going.  I have to get out to the track."
clerk,There's no hurry!  The race is over!
duke, Not for me.
clerk,Let's have lunch!
duke,Righto!
duke,Do me one last favor Lord: just give me five more high-speed hours before you bring the hammer down; just let me get rid of this goddamn car and off of this horrible desert.
highway patrolman,Just what the FUCK did you think you were doing?!
highway patrolman,May I see your license.
duke,"Of course, officer."
highway patrolman,"Could I have that, please?"
duke,Why not?  It was getting warm anyway.
highway patrolman,You realize...
duke,"Yeah.  I know.  I'm guilty.  I understand that.  I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway.  Shit, why argue?  I'm a fucking criminal."
highway patrolman,That's a strange attitude.
highway patrolman,You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap.  There's a rest area up ahead.  Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
duke,"A nap won't help.  I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights.  I can't even remember.  If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours."
highway patrolman,"Okay.  Here's how it is.  What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?"
duke,How far is Baker?  I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
highway patrolman,Not my jurisdiction.  The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area.  Can you make it that far?
duke,I'll try.  I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time.  I've heard a lot about it.
highway patrolman,"Excellent seafood.  With a mind like yours, you'll probably want to try the land-crab.  Try the Majestic Diner."
duke,"Great Jesus, it's him."
duke,They've nailed me!  I'm trapped in some stinking desert crossroads called Baker.  I don't have much time.  The fuckers are closing in. They'll hunt me down like a beast!
gonzo,Who?  You sound a little paranoid.
duke,You bastard!  I need a lawyer immediately!
gonzo,What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
duke,What?  Fuck telegrams.  I'm in trouble.  You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that?  When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
gonzo,You're supposed to be in Vegas.  We have a suite at the Flamingo.  I was just about to leave for the airport.
gonzo's voice,You brainless scumbag!  You're supposed to be covering the National District Attorney's conference!  I made all the reservations... rented a white Cadillac convertible... the whole thing is arranged!  What the hell are you doing out there in the middle of the fucking desert?
duke,Never mind.  It's all a big joke. I'm actually sitting beside the pool at the Flamingo.  I'm talking from a portable phone.  Some dwarf brought it out from the casino.  I have total credit!  Can you grasp that?  Don't come anywhere near this place! Foreigners aren't welcome here!
police chief,"What do you mean I'm too late to register?  I'm a police chief. From Michigan.  Look, fella, I told you.  I have a postcard here that says I have reservations in this hotel."
clerk," I'm sorry, sir.  You're on the ""late list."" Your reservations were transferred to the... ah... Moonlight Motel, which is out on Paradise Boulevard..."
police chief,I've already paid for my goddamn room!
clerk,"It's actually a very fine place of lodging and only sixteen blocks from here, with its own pool and..."
police chief,You dirty little faggot!  Call the manager!  I'm tired of listening to this dogshit!
clerk," I'm so sorry, sir.  May I call you a cab?"
clerk," Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross- section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. ""Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."""
duke,"Say.  I hate to interrupt, but I wonder if maybe I could just sort of slide through and get out of your way.  Name's Raoul Duke -- Raoul Duke.  My attorney made the reservation."
clerk,"Certainly, Mr. Duke!"
duke,My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible.  Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
duke,"Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?"
clerk,"Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay."
duke,"Well, thank you."
duke,"Ah, home at last!"
duke,You degenerate pig!
gonzo,"It can't be helped.  This is Lucy.  You know--like ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."""
gonzo,"Lucy!  Lucy, be cool, goddamnit! Remember what happened at the airport!  No more of that, okay?"
gonzo,"Lucy... this is my client.  This is Mr. Duke, the famous journalist. He's paying for this suite, Lucy. He's on our side."
gonzo,Mr. Duke is my friend.  He loves artists.
gonzo,Lucy paints portraits of Barbra Streisand.
lucy,I drew these from TV.
gonzo,Fantastic.  She came all the way down here from Montana just to give these portraits to Barbra.  We're going over to the Americana Hotel tonight to meet her backstage...
duke,"Well, I guess they brought the car round by now.  LET'S GET THE STUFF OUT OF THE TRUNK."
gonzo,"Absolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF.  Now, we'll be right back.  Don't answer the phone if it rings."
lucy, God bless.
duke,WELL?  What are your plans?
gonzo,Plans?
duke,Lucy.
gonzo," You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink."
duke,Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
gonzo,"Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months.  It's terrible."
duke,"She's perfect for this gig.  These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her.  We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own."
gonzo,Jesus Christ.  I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
duke,"It's straight economics.  This girl is a god-send.  Shit, she can make us a grand a day."
gonzo,NO!  Stop talking like that.
duke,"I figure she can do about four at a time.  Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day.  Maybe three."
gonzo,You filthy bastard.  I should cave your fucking head in.
duke,"In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member."
gonzo,"NO!  I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!"
duke,"You'll go straight to the gas chamber.  And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consensual Sodomy.  She's got to go."
gonzo,"Shit, it doesn't pay to try to help somebody these days."
gonzo,"We have to cut her loose.  She's got two hundred dollars.  And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in."
duke,What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
gonzo,"It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses.  Anything that she says about us is completely worthless."
duke,Us?
duke,"Hotel Americana?  I need a reservation.  For my niece.  Listen, I need her treated very gently. She's an artist, and might seem a trifle highstrung..."
gonzo,"Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra..."
gonzo,Well that's that.  Take off slowly. Don't attract attention.
gonzo,"I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe.  Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out."
duke,That's good.  You can't be subtle in this town.
gonzo,"As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline."
duke,Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
gonzo,Right.  Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon...
duke,"Come on, we're going to be late."
gonzo,This goddamn mescaline.  Why the fuck can't they make it a little less pure?  Maybe mix it up with Rolaids or something.
executive director," On behalf of the prosecuting attorneys of this county, I welcome you to the Third National DA's Conference on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs."
gonzo," I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this.  Not hundreds of them!"
duke,They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
gonzo,"Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!"
duke,Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
gonzo,This is a fucking nightmare.
duke,Right.  Sure as hell some dope- dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
gonzo, What the fuck are these people talking about?  You'd have to be crazy on acid to think a joint looked like a goddamn cockroach!
gonzo,I know a hell of a lot better ways to waste my time than listening to this bullshit.
gonzo,Fuck you!  I have to get out!  I don't belong here!
film narrator,"KNOW YOUR DOPE FIEND!  YOUR LIFE MAY DEPEND ON IT!  You will not be able to see his eyes because of Tea-Shades, but his knuckles will be white from inner tension..."
film narrator,... and his pants will be crusted with semen from constantly jacking off when he can't find a rape victim...
duke,"Pardon me, I feel sick."
film narrator,"He will stagger and babble when questioned.  He will not respect your badge.  The Dope Fiend fears nothing.  He will attack, for no reason, with every weapon at his command -- including yours..."
duke,"Sorry, sick... Beg pardon!  Feeling sick..."
film narrator,BEWARE.  Any officer apprehending a suspected marijuana addict should use all necessary force immediately. One stitch in time [on him] will usually save nine on you.
da,I'm a whiskey man myself.  We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
gonzo,You will.  One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
da,Naw!
gonzo,They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives.  They might even sit on your wife's chest.  Put the blade right down on her throat.
da,Not down in my parts.
duke," Rum and ice, please."
da, You're another one of these California boys.  Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
duke,"They're everywhere.  Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it.  In L.A. it's out of control.  First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft."
da,"Witchcraft?  Shit, you can't mean it!"
gonzo,Read the newspapers.
duke,"Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!"
da,Naw!  That's science fiction stuff!
duke,Not where we operate.
gonzo,"Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day.  All they want is the blood.  They'll take people right off the street if they have to."
duke,"Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!"
da,What happened?  What did they do to her?
gonzo,"Do?  Jesus Christ, man.  They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot!  Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!"
da, And nobody did anything?
duke,"What could they do?  The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds.  He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s."
gonzo,"They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up..."
duke,Like big lizards.
gonzo,... and every one of them stacked naked...
da,Naked!?
duke,Naked.
gonzo,"Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons."
duke,They were all veterans.
da,Veterans?!!!?
gonzo,Yeh.  The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
da,A major!
gonzo,"We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house."
da,Naw!  Not a major.
gonzo,He wanted the pineal gland.
da,Really?
gonzo,That's how he got so big.  When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.
duke,"Usually, it's whole families. During the night.  Most of them don't even wake up until they feel their heads going -- and then, of course, it's too late."
waitress,Are you guys with the police convention upstairs?
da,"We sure are, Miss."
waitress,I thought so.  I never heard that kind of talk around here before. Jesus Christ!  How do you guys stand that kind of work?
gonzo, We like it.  It's groovy.
duke,"What's wrong with you?  Hell, somebody has to do it."
gonzo,Hurry up with those drinks.  We're thirsty.  Only two rums.  Make mine a Bloody Mary.
da," Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later.  Mostly Atlanta.  But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance.  They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe."
gonzo, You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
da,What do you mean by that?
gonzo,You know what I mean.  We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
duke,Cut their goddamn heads off.  Every one of them.  That's what we're doing in California.
da, WHAT?
gonzo,"Sure.  It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line."
duke,We keep it quiet.  It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs.  Not with the press around.
da," Hell, no.  We'd never hear the goddamn end of it."
duke,Dobermans don't talk.
da,What?
gonzo,Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
duke,They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
da,God almighty!  I don't think I should tell my wife about this.  She'd never understand. You know how women are.
duke,Just be thankful your heart is young and strong.
duke,What's the message?  My light is blinking.
duke,Holy shit!
duke,Lucy called.
gonzo,What?
clerk,"Mr. Duke?  Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering..."
duke,"WHAT?  There's a war on, man!  People are being killed!"
duke,IN VIETNAM!  ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
duke,Tell me.  What do you want?
duke,Crying?  Why was she crying?
duke,"Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over."
duke,Don't worry.  You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
duke,Of course.  And now I have to get back to the news.  Send up some ice.
gonzo,Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
duke, Lucy is looking for you.
gonzo," No, she's looking for you."
duke,Me?
gonzo,"She really flipped over you.  The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself.  I guess she figures you won.  That phone message wasn't for me, was it?"
lucy,"Yessir, those two men in the dock are the ones who gave me the LSD and took me to the hotel."
lucy,"I don't know for sure what they done to me, but I remember it was horrible."
judge,Twenty years... and Double Castration!
gonzo,Wait!  You can't leave me alone in this snake pit.  This room is in my name.
gonzo,"OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her.  I'll get her off our backs. You're right.  She's my problem."
duke,It's gone too far.
gonzo,Relax.  Let me handle this.  Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.
duke,What is this?
gonzo,"You won't need much.  Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome."
duke,Adrenochrome...
gonzo," Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me.  I got your message...what?  Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while.  Yeah.  I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out..."
gonzo,Well.  That's that.  She's probably stuffing herself down the incinerator about now.  That's the last we should be hearing from Lucy.  Where's the opium?
duke,Where'd you get this?
gonzo,"Never mind, it's absolutely pure."
duke,Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
gonzo,"I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me.  He's one of these Satanism freaks.  He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life.  I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on."
gonzo,"Yeah, they nailed this guy for child molesting.  He swore he didn't do it. ""Why should I fuck with children?"" he says. ""They're too small."" Christ, werewolf is entitled to legal counsel.  I didn't dare turn the creep down. He might have picked up a letter opener and gone after my pineal gland!"
duke,Why not?  We should get some of that.  Just eat a big handful and see what happens.
gonzo,Some of what?
duke, Extract of pineal!
gonzo, Sure.  That's a good idea.  One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
gonzo,"Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours..."
duke,Right!
gonzo,... grow claws... bleeding warts.
duke,Yes!
gonzo,... then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...
duke,Fantastic!
gonzo,you'd go blind... your body would turn to wax... they'd have to put you in a wheelbarrow and...
gonzo,Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
duke,FINISH THE FUCKING STORY!  What happened?!  What about the glands?
gonzo,"Jesus, that stuff got right on top of you, didn't it."
duke,"Maybe you could just... shove me into the pool, or something..."
gonzo,"If I put you in the pool right now, you'd sink like a goddamn stone. You took too much.  Jesus, look at your face, you're about to explode."
gonzo,"Don't try and fight it, or you'll get brain bubbles.  Strokes, aneurysms.  You'll just wither up and die."
nixon,Sacrifice... sacrifice... sacrifice...
maid,Please... please... I'm only the maid.  I didn't mean nothin!...
duke, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
gonzo, She must have used a pass key.  I was polishing my shoes in the closet when I noticed her sneaking in-so I took her.
duke, What made you do it?  Who paid you off?
maid,Nobody.  I'm the maid!
gonzo,You're lying!  You were after the evidence.  Who put you up to this -- the manager?
maid,I don't know what you're talking about!
gonzo,Bullshit!  You're just as much a part of it as they are!
maid,Part of what?
duke,The dope ring.  You must know what's going on in this hotel.  Why do you think we're here?
maid," I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention.  I swear!  All I wanted to do was clean up the room.  I don't know anything about dope!"
gonzo,"Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman."
maid,No!  No!  I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
duke,Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
maid,No!  I swear I'm not!
gonzo," In that case, maybe she can help."
maid,Yes!  I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
duke,"So do we, lady."
gonzo, I think we should put her on the payroll.  See what she comes up with.
duke,Do you think you can handle it?
maid,What?
gonzo,"One phone call every day.  Just tell us what you've seen.  Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem."
maid,You'd pay me for that?
duke,"You're damn right.  But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?"
maid,Alice.  Just ring Linen Service and ask for Alice.
gonzo,"Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock.  He'll be posing as a politician."
duke,Inspector Rock will pay you.  In cash.  A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
maid,Oh Lord!  I'd do just about anything for that!
gonzo,You and a lot of other people.
duke,"The password is: ""One Hand Washes The Other."" The minute you hear that, you say ""I fear nothing."""
maid,I fear nothing.
gonzo,"Oh, and don't bother to make up the room.  That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?"
maid,"Whatever you say, gentlemen.  I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened..."
gonzo,"Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people."
duke,Sure is.
duke,Any of you folks want the milk? We're after the meat.  This is honest coconut essence.  Real meat.
gonzo,Fuck the car.  They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
duke,Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
duke,"You poor fools don't understand, do you?  This car is the property of the World Bank!  That money goes to ITALY!"
gonzo,Police?  Are you people crazy?
duke,This crowd is not rational.  They can't relate to us.  Let's go!
duke,You people voted for Hubert Humphrey! You killed Jesus!
duke,"The manager told me a story about the owner of this place...about how he always wanted to run away and join the circus when he was a kid. Well, now the bastard has his own circus, and a license to steal, too."
duke,Absolutely!  Pure Horatio Alger... Say...
rental agent,"Holy God!, how did this happen?"
duke,They beat the shit out of it.
rental agent,The top's completely jammed!
duke,"Yeah, something's wrong with the motor..."
duke,"No, no.  Shit..."
duke,Goddamnit!  What's the bail?  I want that ape!  I've already reserved two first-class seats on the plane.
gonzo,Hey there!  You folks want to buy some heroin?
gonzo,"Hey, honkies!  Goddamnit, I'm serious.  I want to sell you some pure fucking smack!"
gonzo,"Cheap heroin!  This is the real stuff!  You won't get hooked.  I just got back from Vietnam!  This is scag, folks.  Pure scag!"
gonzo,Shoot!  Fuck!  Scag!  Blood! Heroin!  Rape!  Cheap!  Communist! Jab it right in your fucking eyeballs!
duke, Back door beauty!
voice off,Shit!  Faggot!  Bastard!
gonzo, Two glasses of ice water with ice.
duke,What was that?
waitress,What is this?
gonzo,A napkin.
waitress,Don't give me that bullshit!  I know what it means!  You goddamn fat pimp bastard.
gonzo,That's the name of a horse I used to own.  What's wrong with you?
waitress,"You sonofabitch!  I take a lot of shit in this place, but I sure as hell don't have to take it off a SPIC PIMP!"
waitress, Pay your bill and get the hell out! You want me to call the cops?
gonzo,Spic pimp?
gonzo, How much is the lemon meringue pie?
waitress, Thirty-five cents!
gonzo, I mean the whole pie.
gonzo,Let's say five dollars.  Okay?
gonzo,What are you doing?  You were supposed to turn back there!
gonzo,Jesus Christ!!!
gonzo,Goddamnit!  We're lost!  What are we doing out here on this godforsaken road?
gonzo,The airport is over there!
duke,Never missed a plane yet.
duke,I'll drop you right next to the plane.
gonzo,No!  I can't get out!  They'll crucify me.  I'll have to take the blame!
duke," Ridiculous!  Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up.  You never saw me before.  Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles.  I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate.  You ready?"
gonzo,"Why not?  But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!"
duke,Hey!
duke,"Don't take any guff from those swine.  Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People."
gonzo,Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
gonzo,"Probably good advice, if you have shit for brains."
duke,"We are all wired into a survival trip now.  No more of the speed that fueled that 60's.  That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip. He crashed around America selling ""consciousness expansion"" without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait for all the people who took him seriously..."
duke,All those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit.  But their loss and failure is ours too.  What Leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped create...
duke,"... a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force -- is tending the light at the end of the tunnel."
duke,Ahhh.  Wonderful.
proprietor,What'll you have?
duke, Ballantine Ale...?
duke,Hard to find it served like this anymore.
proprietor,"Where ya comin' from, young man?"
duke,Las Vegas.
proprietor,"A great town, that Vegas.  I bet you had good luck there.  You're the type."
duke,I know.  I'm a triple Scorpio.
proprietor, That's a fine combination.  You can't lose.
duke," Oh, my God!..."
proprietor, This is my granddaughter...
duke, Just another good American like yourself.
duke,HOLY SHIT!!!
duke,GOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!
