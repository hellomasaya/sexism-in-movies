george,"There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it."
fred,That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
george,I know.
fred,"Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word."
george,"No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I just don't want..."
fred,What are you going to do?
george,I'm going to California.
girls,You guys need some help?
tuna,"I don't know about you, but I think we're gonna like it here."
tuna,"Hey, wake up.  Come on, you two lovebirds.  Hurry, I want to show you something."
george,Figured what out?
tuna,"You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out."
barbara,"Tuna, this is crap."
tuna,I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
barbara,It's garbage.
george,"It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?"
tuna,"We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything."
barbara,You can't sell this to your friends.
tuna,Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
barbara,"Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy."
george,Are you sure this guy is cool?
barbara,You'll see for yourself.
tuna,A beauty parlor for men?  Sounds pretty queer.
george,Nothing like this back home.
barbara,Derek!
derek,Barbie!
george,George.
tuna,Tuna.
derek,"Tuna, oh my.  Enchante, George.  Barbie, he's yummy.  He looks like a Ken doll. Oooh, Ken and Barbie.  It's perfect. Alright, girls, give me five minutes."
george,We want some grass.
derek,"I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?"
george,No.
derek,"Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment."
george,"We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?"
derek,"I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you."
george,What the fuck is that?
derek,It's your grass.
tuna,Wow.  That's more than we had in mind.
derek,I don't nickel and dime.  You want it or not?
george,We'll take it.
george,This is it for me.
barbara,What is?
george,"Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right."
barbara,"You happy, baby?"
george,Yeah.  I am.

barbara,"You happy, baby?"
george,Yeah.  I am.
tuna,Look what the cat dragged in.
george,"Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?"
kevin,"Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California."
george,"Yeah, but what are you doing out here?"
kevin,I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
george,This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
kevin,"No, man.  I'm too fucked up."
tuna,"Nice weed, huh?"
kevin,Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
george,Right on.
kevin,"G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really..."
george,Stoned?
kevin,I wish there was shit like this back home.
george,Yeah?
kevin,"Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?"
tuna,"No shit, Kevin?"
kevin,That's right.
george,Yeah?
kevin,"When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U...."
tuna,Smith.  Hampshire....
kevin,"Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit."
george,"The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag."
derek,"You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week."
george,"Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight."
barbara,We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
george,"I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell."
derek,I don't know...
george,Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
derek,"Come on, George, no one is going to pay that."
george,It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
derek,Goodness.
george,"Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear."
derek,And I only deal with you?
george,Barbara and me.  No one else.
barbara,"It's gonna work, Derek."
derek,I don't know.  East coast.  Airplanes. It all sounds pretty risky.
george,She's a flight attendant.  They don't check her bags.
barbara,Any message?
kevin,Keep it coming.
kevin,More.
kevin,I need more.
barbara,"What do you want me to do?  I can only take two bags, and I can't fly back here everyday."
kevin,"I know, but I've got a feeding frenzy on my hands.  Tell George this is small potatoes.  We're missing out on some serious cash.  You tell George.  He'll think of something."
kevin,"Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars."
tuna,"Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it."
kevin,"What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother."
tuna,"Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich."
george,It's not enough.
kevin,What?
tuna,"What the fuck are you talking about, man?"
george,"The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled."
kevin,So?
george,"So, we need to get to the source."
tuna,Source?  What about Derek?
george,"He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him."
kevin,Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
george,Who speaks Spanish?
tuna,"This is bullshit, George.  We're never going to find anything down there."
kevin,"You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs."
derek,I don't think so.
george,"You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode."
rada,"Georgie, we're gonna get busted if we keep this up."
george,We're not gonna get busted.
kevin,"George, we'll wind up in a Mexican prison getting fucked up the ass by one of Maria's relatives."
maria,"Hey, fuck you, Dulli.  I'm not Mexican. I'm Italian."
barbara,You're Italian?
kevin,"Yeah, right.  Gonzales.  What is that, Sicilian?"
tuna,"As far as I'm concerned, we're on fucking vacation."
santiago,Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
george,"Yes, I am."
santiago,"For instance, something like this?"
george,Very nice.  I'll take it.
santiago,"Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?"
george,All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
santiago,"Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back."
george,I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
santiago,"Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful."
george,"What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?"
santiago,"Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns."
tuna,I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
kevin,Don't be such a pussy.
george,It's fine.  We're not stealing it. We're borrowing it.  And try to look natural.  We've got company.
tuna,You guys are fucking insane.
george,"Alright, pull back the throttle..."
kevin,"Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about."
amigos,"Hola, George!  Bienvenido!"
santiago,"Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word."
george,"Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it."
george,Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
derek,"Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies."
george,Should we buy it?
barbara,Are you kidding?
george,We'll take it.
mexican boy,Picture?
ermine,"I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring."
fred,I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
ermine,"Yes.  Of course.  But, I'm talking about that ring.  It's something else.  Let me tell you."
barbara,George has exquisite taste.
ermine,"What is that, two carats?  That's got to be two carats."
barbara,I don't know.
ermine,"Yes.  It's at least two carats, darling. Treasure it."
fred,Hard to imagine being able to afford a ring like that on a construction salary.
george,"Well, you know.  It's um..."
ermine,"Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway."
fred,Layaway shmayaway.
ermine,"That's right.  Layaway.  Something you wouldn't know anything about, you cheapskate."
fred,Who's the cheapskate?
ermine,"You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway."
george,"Yeah, layaway."
ermine,"The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a killjoy."
fred,Killjoy?
george,"Honey, your nose!"
barbara,"Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry."
ermine,"Barbara, here, take my napkin."
barbara,Thanks.  I'll be okay.
george,You wanna split?
barbara,"Yeah, I don't feel so well."
george,"Okay, guys, we're gonna leave.  Let's get the check."
george,Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
barbara,I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
george,"I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments."
barbara,Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
george,"No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest."
barbara,Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
george,"Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself."
barbara,"Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute."
george,Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
barbara,"Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us."
judge,"George Jung, you have been accused of possession of six-hundred and sixty pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute.  How do you plead?"
judge,By all means.
george,"In all honesty, I don't feel like what I've done is a crime and I think it's illogical and irresponsible for you to sentence me to prison.  None of the real criminals of the world ever end up behind bars.  I mean, when you think about it, what did I really do?  Cross an imaginary line with a bunch of plants?  You say that I'm an outlaw, you say that I'm a thief, but where's the Christmas dinner for the people on relief?"
judge,"Those are very interesting concepts you have, Mr. Jung. Unfortunately for you, the imaginary line you crossed is real, the plants you brought with you are illegal, and what you did constitutes a crime."
barbara,Surprise.
george,"Baby, you didn't have to come."
barbara,"What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?"
george,Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
barbara,"Two years.  George, I can't wait that long."
george,What?  You're not going to wait for me?
barbara,"George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years."
george,It went too fast.
george,"Hi, Mom."
ermine,Take your boots off.  You're tan.
george,Mexico.
ermine,Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
george,Barbara.
ermine,"Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty."
george,Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
ermine,"You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it."
george,"Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?"
george,May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
fred,...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
both,...to dance with the stars.
fred,You alright?
george,Just low.
fred,"You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her."
george,"Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?"
fred,Tough spot.
george,You mad at me?
fred,Not mad.
george,"Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me."
fred,"I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you."
george,"I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great."
fred,"Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything."
ermine,George!
trout,"George Jung, you are under arrest."
fred,"Open the door, son."
ermine,I had no choice.
guard,Prisoner in.
diego delgado,My name is Diego Delgado.  How do you do?
diego,"If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?"
george,What?
diego,Your offense?  Why are you here?
george,I don't want to talk about it.
diego,Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
george,"Not really, no."
diego,No?
george,"I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego."
diego,"Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good.  But we are roommates, okay?  And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars.  For the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it is your turn.  Now you will tell me, okay?  You will tell me why you are here?"
george,Murder.
diego,"Ah, yes.  The murder."
george,"What do you got there, Diego?"
diego,Nothing.  Just a little project.
george,What kind of project?
diego,Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
george,I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
diego,"You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?"
george,Twenty-six months.
diego,Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
george,"I've got to get out of here, Diego."
diego,Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
george,What's the other one?
george,"Alright, let's open our books."
george,"Alright.  You're right.  I want to get out of this shithole as fast as I can. And I don't want to do this any more than you do.  But for me to walk early, some of you have to graduate.  You, forget about it.  You're hopeless, go to sleep."
george,But the rest of you could get diplomas and get jobs when you're on the outside.
george,"We can learn some criminal shit, too. Alright, I'll make you a deal.  What if half the time, we learn about George Washington, and the other half, I'll teach you how to smuggle drugs?"
george,I was arrested in Chicago with six hundred and sixty pounds of grass.  I think that qualifies me.
george,"Flew it in from Mexico on a single engine Cessna.  Now, do we have a deal or not?"
diego,"George?  Hey, George?  I listen to what you say to the class today about the smuggling.  You are a magico, ah?"
george,"I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed."
diego,"You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?"
george,Good night.
diego,"In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?"
george,I would if I could get some sleep.
diego,"Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?"
george,Because I got caught.
diego,"No, my brother."
george,Because they caught me?
diego,You failed because you had the wrong dream.
george,"I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive."
diego,"No, no.  That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN Miami, we sell for sixty."
george,That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
diego,"And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand."
george,Oh my G-d.
diego,"Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions."
george,Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
diego,Now do you see what I am saying?
george,Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
diego,"Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine."
diego,What type of planes do you have?
george,"Four passenger, single engine Cessna."
diego,How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
george,"I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?"
diego,Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
george,We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
diego,Great.  I love the Bahamas.
george,"Diego Delgado, please?"
diego,Allo?
george,Diego?  It's George.
diego,"George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah? Are you out?"
george,"Yeah, I'm out."
diego,"Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you."
george,How are we doing?
diego,"Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up."
george,Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
diego,"Slow down, George.  Slow down."
george,"I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state."
diego,But you must.  It's the only way.
george,I just got released five minutes ago.
diego,"George, are we gonna do this or not?"
george,"Good to see you, Diego."
diego,"Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet."
diego,Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
george,Okay.
cesar,Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
george,What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
cesar,Tell me about the suitcases.  What is the make and the color?
diego,Samsonites.  Red.  No tags.
cesar,Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
george,"What?  Yeah, sure."
cesar,Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
george,"My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?"
cesar,I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
george,"What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes."
cesar,I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
george,It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
cesar,The coca is my responsibility!
george,You're a fucking amateur!
diego,"Gentlemen, please.  There is no need to be impolite.  Cesar, this will be fine. You have my word.  George, Cesar is just being thorough.  That's all."
cesar,"Very well.  But just remember, Mr. Jung. I will be with you the whole way.  And I will be watching."
customs agent,On vacation?
george,Yes.
customs agent,On vacation for only one day?
george," My brother's wedding.  Imagine that, huh?"
customs agent,"Open your bags, please."
george,Mine.
customs agent,And this?
george,What can I tell you?  Different strokes.
customs agent,"Alright, go ahead."
diego,"Three-hundred kilos it is, then."
stevens,"I'll fly down on a Friday, refuel in the Bahamas, and then to Medellin."
inez,Friday?
diego,"Please, continue."
george,"We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic."
cesar,Why are you speaking?
george,Excuse me?
cesar,You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
george,I see.  How much?
cesar,"Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone.  For you, and you, and you."
stevens,I want two.
george,"Gee, Jack, a million each had such a nice ring to it."
stevens,"No way.  I'm doing all the work.  Taking all the risk, and it's my plane."
george,You good with this?
diego,You will watch what you say.  Especially around George.  He is my brother and he speaks as good Spanish as you.
inez,Get your hands off me.
cesar,Do you have pictures of your kids?
stevens,What?
cesar,"I'll need to see them.  Also need their names and the names of their schools. We are trusting you with ninety million dollars worth of coca, Mr. Stevens. Without your children, there is no deal."
stevens,"Fine.  So if that's all, I'll be leaving now."
cesar,Don't forget the pictures.
diego,"What's the matter, George?"
george,What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
diego,"A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George."
george,It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
diego,I know.
george,"And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?"
diego,"That's my George, always thinking."
george,"What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me."
diego,I need you to go to Miami.
george,I'm George.  Friend of Diego's?
alessandro,QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
george,I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
alessandro,"Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains everything.  Open your mouth, George."
george,Um-hmm.
ermine,You have a phone call.
george,"Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money."
george,"Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on..."
diego,It's a little hard to get away right now.  I'm afraid you're on your own.
george,What did I tell you?
derek,"It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?"
george,Sell it?
diego,"Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?"
george,"Just sell it, Derek."
derek,"Alright, but it's gonna take me a year."
diego,Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
george,"I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek."
diego,Touche.
george,But to the victor belong the spoils.
derek,"Nice doing business with you, George."
george,"Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?"
alessandro,"Greetings, Mr. George."
george,Where do you guys want to count?
alessandro,On the plane.
george,What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
diego,"George, good to see you, my brother."
george,What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
diego,"Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?"
george,Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
diego,Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
george,Just a friend.
diego,"Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind. We'll talk about it later."
george,Yeah.  You do the talking.
diego,There must be some kind of mistake.
diego,"It's alright, George.  You go."
escobar,"So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?"
george,"Actually, it was three."
escobar,"The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?"
george,It would be my pleasure.
escobar,"Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country."
george,Un sapo?
escobar,"Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die."
george,Yes.
escobar,"But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems."
george,"With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him."
escobar,"I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?"
george,"Yes, it is."
escobar,"So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?"
george,"Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me."
escobar,"As much as I can give you?  Ha ha.  Very good.  I like that.  Come, George.  Let us drive.  We have much to talk about."
escobar,I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
george,It's beautiful.
escobar,"People tell me that I am crazy.  That my business will never work in your country.  What do you think, George?"
george,"What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know."
escobar,"Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?"
george,I want money.
escobar,"Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?"
george,Freedom.
escobar,Power?
george,"Yeah, maybe."
escobar,Family.
george,Sure.
escobar,Beautiful girls?
george,Keep them coming.
escobar,"Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money."
george,Money.
escobar,And Diego?
george,Diego is my brother.
escobar,"Good.  Take care of him, George.  I'm fond of him, but he is sometimes like a baby.  Keep an eye on him, okay?"
diego,Padrino.
escobar,"Diego, mijo.  I've made a decision.  We are going into business and I would like to start right away."
george,Three million.  I counted it twice.
diego,"It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure."
george,I'm calling it three.
diego,We're half a million off.
george,Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
diego,"Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five."
george,I don't give a shit.  Close enough.
diego,Try the back bedroom.
george,There's no room.
diego,Try the closet.
george,We've got to do something about this.
george,Are you comfortable with this?
diego,"George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it."
george,And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
diego,Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
george,I love it.
bank president,I'm sorry.
george,I give you thirty-million dollars and you give me this little book.
diego,"I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?"
george,"You're a lucky man, Diego."
diego,"I love you, my brother, do you know that?"
george,"I love you too, man."
inez,"Look, honey, a power boat."
diego,"Great, baby, great!"
george,Hello.
mirtha,Hello.
george,Do I know you?
mirtha,I don't think so.
george,Why are you smiling?
mirtha,Why are you smiling?
george,I don't know.  My name is George.
mirtha,"I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George."
george,What is your name?
cesar,"Mr. Jung, I see you've met my fiancee, Mirtha."
george,Mirtha.
cesar,"Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito."
augusto,"Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras."
george,"My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you."
ramon ochoa,Congratulations on your conquest of the West Coast.   How much bigger can we get?
george,"Sky's the limit.  We're just beginning to tap the market.  If it's accepted by actors and musicians, the rest will follow."
augusto,We are talking about George's West Coast operation.
diego,"Ah, George's mystery man."
rafael ojeda,"Yes, where is this man?  When do we meet him?"
diego,"You don't meet him.  George keeps this a secret.  He's here meeting everyone, goes to Colombia and meets Pablo, but still keeps his secrets.  Even from his brother."
emilio ochoa,"Yes, George, there's enough for everybody."
george,I think Padroni is happy with the current situation.  Will you please excuse me?
mirtha,"You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire."
george,I like fire.
mirtha,I do.
george,Jesus Christ.
mirtha,"Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?"
george,"Put that shit away, they're here."
ermine,It's all so beautiful.
mirtha,"What do you think, Dad?"
fred,Yeah.  Nice.
ermine,"Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune."
george, It's a family heirloom.
ermine,I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
george,Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
ermine,"Oh, I see."
mirtha,Come on.  I'll show you the rest of the house.
george,"So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments..."
fred,"Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time."
george,Dad.
fred,"No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?"
george,"Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now."
diego,Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
george,"Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate."
diego,"I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me."
george,"What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?"
diego,What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
george,"Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't telling you.  It's just business.  Now, shut up.  You're driving me crazy."
diego,I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What happened to our dream?
tony,Algun problema?
george,"No no no... no problema, amigo.  El dinero esta todo aqui. Lleves las ""llaves"" y mas tarde lo contaremos.  Okay?  No problem."
tony,Que problema?  Nosotros esperamos.
diego," You embarrassed me, George.  You make me look very bad."
benny,Que esta diciendo?
george,Nothing.  Todo esta bien.
diego," Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!"
george,"This is not the time, Diego."
tony,Hay algun problema?  Hablame!
diego, You fucked me in front of my whole family!
george,Fuck you...I didn't fuck you.
benny,"Maldita sea, que diablos esta diciendo?"
george,"Esta todo aqui, amigo...take the keys. Take 'em and go."
tony,"Que esta pasando aqui, jefe?"
diego,Sientese ye no se meta en lo que no le importa.
george,Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
diego,"Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas campesinos?"
george,Take the fucking keys!
diego,Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
george,"No problem, gentlemen.  Goodbye."
diego,What?
george,Derek Foreal.  Derek Foreal.  Derek fucking Foreal.  Alright?  The answer to all your dreams.  Are you happy now?
fred,"Hello, hello."
augusto,"I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst."
mirtha,Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
augusto,"I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the bar.  And if you find her, tell her to come, it's almost midnight."
diego,Where's Diego?
augusto,"He's not here, George."
george,"Yeah, well where is he?  And who is this Norman K. guy?  That's all anyone is talking about.  Norman K.  Norman K.  Do I know him?"
augusto,"Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home."
george,What?
augusto,"Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip."
george,Motherfucker works fast.
augusto,The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
george,He what?
augusto,Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
george,That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
derek,I don't want to get caught in the middle of this.  That's between you and Diego.
george,Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
mirtha,Que va hacer?
augusto,"Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada."
maria,Alguna cosa tiene que hacer.
maria,No Puedes hacer ni un culo.
augusto,"El no va hacer nada.  Hay un problema. Aqui, hubo un error y nosotros lo vamos ha arreglar."
blanca,No le escusches a mi yerno.  A el solo le importa la plata.
blanca,"Sabes que, vos no tenes pantalones. Nadie te va a respetar.  Usa esto.  Deja solo un huequito tan pequeno, que ni sangre le va a salir a ese malparido del Diego."
augusto,"Blanca, por favor."
mirtha,"Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima."
augusto,"Dejen la maricada pues!  No jodan! Nadie va a matar a nadie!  George, debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica manera, mano."
george,"No, no, no, no yo puedo arregarlo solo."
cesar,"Good to see you, George.  It's been a long time."
diego,"George, I am happy to see you.  How are you, my brother?"
george,"No more brothers, Diego."
diego,"Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George."
george,"You fucked me, Diego."
diego,I did not.
george,You went behind my back and you cut me out.
diego,"No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never."
george,"I talked to Foreal, Diego."
diego,Maybe you are right.  I did betray you a little bit.
george,"You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man."
diego,"George, don't be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother."
cesar,"Say ""hi"" to your pretty wife for me."
escobar,"George, you look terrible."
george,"Yeah, well..."
escobar,Diego?
george,Yeah.
escobar,Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
george,I didn't come here to drink scotch.
escobar,"I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is."
george,"You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk."
escobar,"It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher."
george,You're saying life will take care of Diego?
escobar,"Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher."
george,"I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!"
escobar,"I'm sorry, George."
george,"Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?"
escobar,"Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George."
mirtha,"George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you."
george,"Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out."
mirtha,Pablo said no?
george,Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
ermine,"George, it's time!  George!  George!"
george,Coming!
nurse,He fainted.
mirtha,George!
george,Coke.
george,I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
george,Today.
george,"Come on.  Come on, honey.  You can do it.  Come to Daddy."
mirtha,She did that before.
george,No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
mirtha,Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
george,But this is...
mirtha,"I said, I've seen it before."
george,Alright.
mirtha,Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
george,Where are you going?
mirtha,Out.
derek,"Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me."
george,Yeah.  She told me.
derek,"Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too."
george,I heard.
derek,I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
george,"It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too."
derek,You?
george,For calling you a homo.
derek,That was out of line.
george,"Good to see you, Derek."
mirtha,"Now let's fucking party, motherfuckers! Let's have some fucking fun."
derek,"Jesus, is that Mirtha!?"
george,I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's going to blow an O-ring.
mirtha,"Happy birthday, baby.  Do a line."
george,"No, that's alright."
mirtha,"Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid."
george,"No honey, I'm alright."
augusto,"A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I 95, north and south.  My brother-in-law. Happy birthday!"
everyone,To George!
party guest,Cops!  They're all over the place.
bartender,Freeze!
waiter,Massachusetts State Police Department! Everybody on the floor!
george,What's this?
george,I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
george,"Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing."
george,"Oh hey, one more thing?"
george,Get me a six pack.
george,Fuck.
george,Hi.
fred,"I heard.  Ermine, your son is here."
george,Mom.
ermine,"Don't you dare step one foot in this house.  You're not my son, you hear me? I don't have a son anymore."
fred,She's angry.  It's all over the news.
george,Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
fred,You're not going to trial?
george,No.
fred,Good.
george,"Give this to Mom, will you?"
fred,Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
george,"Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy."
fred,"Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?"
george,"Tell Mom, you know..."
fred,I'll tell her.
george,I'd like to make a withdrawal.
bank employee,"Excuse me, please."
bank president,"I'm afraid there is a problem, Mr. Jung. The banks have gone through a change, a nationalization.  I'm afraid your funds have been appropriated by the Panamanian Government..."
mirtha,What are we going to do?!  What are we going to use for money?!
george,"Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something."
mirtha,Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer the question.  What do I spend?  What? How will we live?
george,Not in front of the kid.
mirtha,Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
george,"Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset."
kristina,What's happening to us?
george,I don't know.
kristina,Are we gonna split up?
george,"No, never.  Don't even think about that, it's impossible.  I love your mother. And you are my heart.  Could I live without my heart?  Could I?"
george,"There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya."
mirtha,"Fuck you, George, just fucking drive."
george,"Hey, why don't you just put a ""I'm doing cocaine"" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?"
mirtha,"My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy."
george,What?
mirtha,"That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me."
george,Those are my nuts!
mirtha,He's a fugitive and a fucking cocaine dealer!  There's a kilo in his trunk right now!  Take this sorry motherfucker to jail!
mirtha,"I'm divorcing you, George.  I'm getting custody of Kristina.  And when you get out next week, you're going to pay support and that's the end of it. Alright?  There's someone else.  I'm sorry."
george,What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
mirtha,"Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say something like that.  Always thinking about yourself."
george,My baby.  She's so big.
kristina,I thought you couldn't live without your heart.
george,"Hello, Derek?  It's George.  Yeah. Yeah, I am.  I'm in Miami.  I'm looking to do something.  I want to put together a crew.  Do you know anybody?  Leon?  I don't know him.  What's his last name? Alright.  Give me the number."
kristina,What are you doing here?
george,Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
kristina,"Well, here I am.  See?"
george,How are you doing?
kristina,"George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay."
george,Dad.
kristina,What?
george,You can call me Dad if you want.
kristina,"I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone."
george,"Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on..."
kristina,What do you want from me?
george,Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
kristina,"Do what you want, it's a free country."
leon,It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
george,Who's the co-pilot?
leon,"You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation."
george,Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
leon,They're over at the booth.
george,"Holy shit, Dulli!"
kevin,"Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!"
augusto,"Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?"
george,No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
augusto,"Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem."
george,Five-thousand per kilo.
augusto,"Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?"
george,"This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?"
george,"Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?"
kristina,"You mean, like a trip?"
george,"Yeah, sure, whatever."
kristina,I don't know.  Maybe California.
george,California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
kristina,Yeah.
george,What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
kristina,No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
george,"California, huh?"
kristina,California.
george,Go on inside now.  I want to talk to your mom alone.
kristina,"Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?"
george,I'll be here.
mirtha,What do you want?
george,"You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?"
mirtha,Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
george,"Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?"
mirtha,"I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony."
george,"Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going."
mirtha,Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
george,"Yeah, you will.  Of course."
mirtha,"Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her."
george,Yeah.
mirtha,She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
george,"I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then."
mirtha,"Hey, George.  You okay?"
george,Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
kevin,"We take off from Lauderdale, Sunday, refuel, and be in Medellin by Monday."
leon,"Overnight, refuel, and back Wednesday night."
george,Where are you coming in?
ben,Vero Beach.
leon,Then we drive it to the Lauderdale house where it stays until pick up and payment the next morning.  You want to go over it again?
george,No.  All set.  Piece of cake.
george,I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me?
kristina,Where are you going?
george,I don't know.  Maybe California.
kristina,You swear?
george,"Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school."
kristina,You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
george,You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
kristina,But I've got school.
george,There's schools in California.
kristina,You swear?
george,That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
kristina,I don't believe you.
george,I swear.  On my life.
kristina,Swear on my life.
george,I swear on your life.
kevin,Are we good?
george,"Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance."
leon,"Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large."
george,I don't give a shit.  Split it up.  Have a great life.  I'm done.  I'm out. Starting over.  Cheers.
leon,What?
ben,Me too.  He's not such a bad guy.
kevin,Fuck you guys.  All of you.  I've known him for thirty fucking years.  Fucking George.
leon,"Yeah, I like him, too.  But what's done is done.  So let's not get all sentimental about it, okay?"
george," Dulli, I was just thinking about that time we landed in Mexico.  You've gotten a lot better since then, huh pal? Remember that fucking landing strip? Huh?"
george,"Oh, no."
zigmond,"Here's the deal, George.  You're not getting out.  I tried to get you furloughed, but your mother squashed it. Said it would only upset him.  I'm sorry."
george,How's he doing?
zigmond,"Well, he's out of the hospital, but there's not much anyone can do for him. It's just a matter of time.  Listen, I brought a tape recorder in case you wanted to say something to him.  That way he could hear your voice."
george,Right.
fred,That's where you belong...
fred,...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.
george,"I guess I kind of lost sight of things. ""May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars.""  Love, George."
fred,That was a beautiful message.
george,I meant every word of it.
fred,Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
george,"Yeah, Dad.  I knew that."
garcia,"How are you doing, George?"
george,What do you guys want?
garcia,"You hear about your old friend, Diego?"
george,What about him?
garcia,"He's going down, George.  It's election year.  We're not making any deals."
garcia,"So, how would you like to help us put him away?"
george,I don't think so.
garcia,"Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more."
george,"No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat."
george,"Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?"
mirtha,Kristina's fine.
george,Is she here?  Is she coming?

george,Yeah.
mirtha,"Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were ""Fuck Diego."""
george,He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
mirtha,"George, he wasn't asking."
george,"Mirtha, how are you doing?"
mirtha,Better than you.

george,Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
calibanos,"Yes, we are Mr. Jung."
george,"Yes, I am."
calibanos,Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
george,"No, I cam here out of my own volition."
calibanos,Excuse me?
george,Something about vengance being best served cold.
calibanos,"Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?"
george,Excuse me?
calibanos,"Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?"
george,"I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen."
calibanos,"So you do have an agreement with the United States Government, Mr. Jung, correct?"
