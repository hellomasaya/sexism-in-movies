mischa, Where to?
marian,Are you sure you got my bag in?
mischa,What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
marian,"I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute."
marian,I want to go to 526 East 5TH.  That's in the East Village.  My daughter said it would cost thirty dollars.
marian,I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
mischa,And where is she?
marian,"She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here."
mischa,"So, you come here all by yourself?"
marian,"Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ..."
mischa,... Oh ...
marian,... And the children thought I should take a trip.
mischa,Yeah.
marian,I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
mischa,Moscow.
marian,Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
mischa,"Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole."
marian, You mean it's dangerous?
mischa,"Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day."
marian,"Pardon me, Mischa.  Is this 526 East 5TH Street?"
mischa,"No, no.  Sorry, I can't drive you to door.  There's a roadblock on Avenue B ...  right there ..."
mischa,This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
marian, This way?
mischa,Yeah.  Not far.  You will be fine.  It's still day.
marian,I see.  How much?
mischa,Forty-five all total.
marian,Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
mischa,"Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up."
mischa,"Hey, lady.  Hold purse like this."
mischa, Good luck.
marian,Maybe some other time.
paula,Mom!  Hi!  I'll be right down.
paula,"So, what do you think?"
marian,"Well, once you're inside, it's nice."
paula,You don't like where I live?
marian,"Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!"
paula,"That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it."
paula,"You take the M-15 bus all the way to ... 79TH Street.  And then you take the crosstown bus to 5TH Avenue, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art is right there.  You can't miss it."
marian,I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
paula,Uh-huh?
marian,... What are they all doing there?
paula,That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
marian, The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
paula,I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
biker,"Oh, Marian ..."
paula, You didn't leave the house all day?
marian,Would you look at those strawberries. They made the best jam.  Here are some more pictures of the farm. Crops were unbelievable this year.
marian,Plenty of rain.  Your dad would have been happy with that.
marian,I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
paula, That's why it's good you came to visit me.
marian, How are you doing sweetheart?
paula,I'm good.
marian,Dating anyone?
paula,"No, I'm working too much, I don't have time."
marian,What about the fellow in those pictures?
paula,What pictures?
marian,You know ...  ... whoops!
paula, Mother!
marian,"Well, they were right out in plain view."
paula,Behind the books.
marian,But I was dusting.
paula, I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
marian,He seemed quite taken with you.
paula,I don't want to talk about it.
marian," You know, you never tell me anything."
paula,"That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York."
marian,"Excuse me.  Could you please turn your motorcycles off?  They're so loud, I can't sleep."
disciple prospect,"You're just chilling, huh?  Not on this block, do you understand?"
marian,"Oh, no."
disciple prospect,"What's this, huh?"
kid,I ain't got shit on me.
disciple prospect,"What is that?   You're chilling, man? Well, then maybe we need to warm things up for you, man.  How many times do we got to tell you?  You don't listen and you don't learn and that's the problem. That is the problem."
marian,My daughter lives here and I'm her mother and I've lost my keys.
marian,Hello?  Hello?
disciple,Roast him!
kid, All right all right all right.
marian," Her mother has lost her keys and is stranded on the street with the Satan's Disciples ... When she comes back, would you tell her to come home as quickly as she can? ... Thank you."
marian,"Oh, please, don't hurt me."
disciple prospect,"I just need to use the phone, lady."
marian,"Oh, let me get out of your way then."
disciple prospect,What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
marian, Have a nice day.
disciple prospect,Washing machine repairman.
paula,Maybe you should lay low tomorrow.  I'm going to see if I can get off early and maybe we can take the ferry cruise. Okay?
paula, Three left.
paula, Okay?  Does that sound like a plan?
marian,Who is it?
marika,It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
marian,She's at work.  I'm her mother.
marika,Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
marika,I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
marian,Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
marika,"And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year."
marian, Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
marika, Really?
marian,"Oh, it was such a big scandal."
marika,What happened?
marian,Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
marian,"You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single."
marika,What does he do?
marian,He's an organic farmer.
marika," Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice."
marika,"I wish they wouldn't come and go in packs, then they wouldn't be so loud."
marian,I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
marika,... Manly?
marika,"You know, probably none of them had a mother like you."
marian,"Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday."
disciple prospect,"Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome."
marian,My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
disciple prospect,"We like to think so, yeah."
marian,And you don't deal drugs?
disciple prospect,Who told you we deal drugs?
marian,I'm just concerned about my daughter.
disciple prospect,You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
marian,What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
disciple prospect, That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind on this block.
disciple prospect,Is there something else I can do for you?
marian,"Well, I'd love to see inside your club."
disciple prospect, You want to come inside?
marian,"Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything."
disciple prospect,Her daughter lives across the street and she was wondering ...
head disciple,What?
disciple prospect,She's curious ...
head disciple,What the hell ...  Come on in.
head disciple, You watch your step here.
head disciple,"Hey, guys.  This here is, uh ..."
marian, Marian.
head disciple, Marian!
head disciple, Marian's daughter lives across the street and she was a little worried about her.
marian,"You know, this isn't so bad.  It looks like our kids' rooms when they were growing up."
marian,Could use some cleaning.
marian,"Well, I'd better be going.  It was nice meeting all of you."
head disciple,"You know, if we can do anything for you, Marian, you just let us know."
marian," At night, your motorcycles are so darn loud, I'm not getting much sleep.  Now, I'm going home in a few days, so ... could I ask you to keep them quiet?"
head disciple," Well, we'll, uh, see what we can do, Marian."
marian,Thank you.
paula,Hello.
paula,"Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer."
marian," Oh, it's so nice to meet you."
marian, I met the Satan's Disciples today.
paula,"Mother, I ..."
marian," My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people."
marian,I had a wonderful time.
marian,And they were so friendly those young men.  Though I do think they should shave their beards and ... and get some nicer clothes.
marian,What do you say ... we take a subway uptown and see a play tonight?
marian,What's wrong?
paula,"Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?"
marian," Oh, that has nothing to do with it."
paula,"No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own."
paula,"The, um, other night, I got up to get a glass of water and you were standing by the window talking to daddy.  I called out to you, but you didn't answer.  You remember?"
paula,"New York is a ... it's a strange place in the summertime.  The noise, the warm air, it's ... easy to imagine things."
paula,"Now, you know you didn't go into the clubhouse, did you?"
disciple prospect,"Yo, man!"
paula,"Mom, I need to talk to you."
marian," If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it."
paula,"No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?"
marian,"Oh, I hope so, dear."
paula,You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
marian,Aaron?
paula,Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
marian,I'm sorry.
paula,"It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?"
marian,Mm hmm.
paula,I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
marian,"Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything."
paula,You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
marian,"Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling."
paula,I'd love to.
paula,Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
marian,"At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better."
paula,Mother!
marian,I can make my own decisions.
paula,"I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?"
marian,Mm hmm.
paula," Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!"
marian," Goodbye, sweetheart."
disciple prospect,All right?
