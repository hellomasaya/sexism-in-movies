voice,"Hi, hello, it's uh. Look uh, you don't call me back so I don't know how to do this. If I can't... if you're not gonna return my calls then there's no way for us to communicate. So uh... '"

dave,Well I gotta shower.
mark,Same.
large,"Okay, well... You know I'll have to see with all this... this."
mark,"All right. Well, welcome back."
dave,Peace. Large heads back to his car. The crowd has dispersed.
woman 1,.Well you had to call her; she never called anyone. A woman in a white tennis outfit talking to a group.
woman 2,This was a woman who never smiled. An older man in glasses with cream cheese all over his lips.
man 1,Somebody ate all the lox. THE CAMERA MOVES TO: Two very Jewish older ladies simultaneously telling the same story to a group of friends.
lady 1,"The new thing is ""Talk to the hand."""
lady 2,That's what they're doing.
lady 1,But you got a hold it out like this.
lady 2,Like you're saying...
lady 1,"""I don't have the time for you."""
lady 2,"""So talk to my hand."""
lady 1,"""He's the only one with time..."
lady 2,Like you're saying...
lady 1,"""I don't have the time for you."""
lady 2,"""So talk to my hand."""
lady 1,"""He's the only one with time..."
lady 2,"""Time for the nonsense that you're giving me. Large site on a couch in the den next to his Aunt Sylvia, the singer from the funeral. Some young children play on the rug in front of them. Large stares off into space as she pets one of the children's heads and looks to Large for conversation."
sylvia,"Did you know your mother redid the hallway bathroom? Large looks over, realizing she's talking to him."
large,What? Sorry. Who?
sylvia,Since I met her she never showed an interest in anything. Then all of a sudden a month ago she wakes up and decides to redecorate a bathroom. I helped her.
large,That's great.  I'll bet it was... fun.
sylvia,Well I sew. I made you something.
large,Me? Thank you. Did you... sew it?
sylvia,It's a shirt.
large,Great.
sylvia,"I made short sleeves... you know, for LA."
large,Great. I'll wear it.
sylvia,Will you try it on nowt
large,Now?
sylvia,"Well just in case I have to fix it before you leave again and we don't see you for another nine years, I want to make sure it fits."
large,oh. okay.
sylvia,You're gonna love the material. I used the leftovers from your Mother's design. Gorgeous.
large,Hi.
large,How you doin'?
gideon,"""Well besides that tire. Lincoln, how was the show?"""
large,"You know I'm not really sure what to say here, Dad, so I'm sorry."
gideon,Mmnn.
large,From afar at the cemetery.
gideon,She's on call tonight; she volunteers as an EMT for the Rescue Squad. She's doing so well in med school.
large,"Yeah, she's amazing. I'm really happy that everything's working out so well for her. She deserves that."
gideon,I have very fond memories of the two of you running around here when you were little kids like brother and sister. Silence.
large,I'm okay.
gideon,Go see Dr. Cohen first thing tomorrow morning. Re's a neurologist in my building. I'll call him and he'll fit you in. I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. Silence. Large nods.
large,House looks great.
gideon,Oh? That's nice. We've been... doing a lot of work on it.
large,Really?
gtdeon,"Actually, no. I don't know why I just said that. We haven't done anything to it."
large,The bathroom in the hall. I noticed someone redid that.
gideon,"Yeah. That's new. Did you eat? You should eat. Aunt Sylvia put this whole thing together out there. I think there's enough food out there for... everybody. I mean, more.than everybody... there's a lot of food out there."
large,okay. I think I'll go have some..
gideon,There's dessert too.
large,Great. Okay.
gideon,Cake or something.
large,Great. Large starts to leave.
gideon,I'm glad you're here. Large stops in the doorway.
a picture,"Several people are seated amongst dozens of presents laughing. A. seven year old Large stands with his arm around a seven year old Cynthia. They both wear enormous ""chicken- foot"" slippers and smile from ear to ear. Large's POV: zooms into the face of the only person in the photo not smiling. This is Sarah Largeman. She stands; not yet requiring a wheelchair. He crosses to the bed and sits down. The surface sends waves ,towards the pillows throwing them off the bed, revealing it's"
large,Hello?... Hey. No... Yes.
large,Fuck. The cop car stops behind him and blares him with the search light.
cop,"Hands on your head, please!"
large,What?

kfnw,I mean that's why you're home.
large,Yeah... yup.
kenny,"I know, I know."
large,"Why, Kenny?"
kenny,"I don't know; I couldn't think of anything better to do. And it's really cool though, man. People really listen to you. They have to. And check this shit out. He pulls his gun out of his holster to show Large."
large,"Yeah but, I mean... Kenny, the last time I saw you, you were blowing coke lines off the top of a urinal."
kenny,"I had to grow up now, man, I wasn't makin' shit at the fish market. No one knew who I was. I couldn't get laid. This is a much better situation for me. Speakin' of which, how did I do?"
large,What do you mean?
kenny,I mean you know... how did I do?
large,You mean like... as a... cop?
kenny,Yeah.
large,"I don't know. I mean I thought, you were a dick... so I guess that's good."
kenny,"Ah fuck, man. I hear you're like some huge movie star; you played some big football player or something. I didn't nee it."
large,Yeah.
kenny,Fuckin' DeNiro and shit.
large,What?
kenny,fie ' s awe some .
large,Yeah.
kenny,"Deer Hunter. We should talk, man; I have some good ideas for movies, and you could like play me and shit. ""Stories From the Force-"""
large,"Yeah, definitely. They stand there; nodding."
kenny,So what are you doin' tonight?
large,"That depends, are you arresting me? Kenny laughs."
kenny,Shut the fuck upf Course not.
large,Okay.
kenny,Wanna see my kid. He shows Large a picture in his wallet.
large,"You got a kid, too? Wow."
kenny,"Everybody's got kids now, man; they're great. It's like your own ""Mini-Me""; way better than my cats,"
kenny,"Wellthiswas Halloween. He was ""OL'DirtyBastard."" Yeah, already likesraplike his dad. So what d'yousayyou were doin' tonight?"
large,I think I'm gonna meet Mark and Dave over at some party.
kenny,The Gleasons?
large,"Yeah, I think."
kenny,can you believe that kids havin' a party at that house? His brother hung himself like two weeks ago in his bedroom.
large,Really?
kenny,Cut him down myself. Seth. Did you know him?
large,I don't think so.
kenny,He tried like three times. Finally got what he wanted.
large,"Oh, you get off soon?"
kenny,No. But we'll be by to bust it up by two. if it's crowded we might get to wear riot gear.
large,"Oh, that would be great... to see that. So I guess I'll see you then."
kenny,"Great seeing you, man."
large,Yeah. You too. Benny gets in his car and pulls up alongside Large. He picks up the CB and the PA CRACKLES on:
mark,holy chit look at this guy! Everyone looks to Large at the end of the line.
drunk,What are you doin home? A beat as Large realizes he has to answer that question.
large,I uh...
mark,Press junket.
drunk,"That's phat yo. Fuck yeah, Serpico and Shit... The crowd quickly moves onto other things."
mark," You like that? That's improvisation, bitch. You can use it."
mark,You see this?
large,in that him?
mark,That was him. Dug the hole myself.
large,Did you know him?
mark,"Nah. Ugly motherfucker though, huh? It pains Large to even try to respond to that."
mark,"Shut the fuck up. Who is that, O'Malley? I'll beat your aael"
large," Yeah, who's that?"
large,"oh hey, what's up."
shut upi,Mark pulls the door closed.
mark,"I can't tell what's more disgusting; those two hooking up in that room, or those two hooking up."
large,"Hey, what's going on, man?"
jesse,bargeman. They hug and pat each other on the back.
large,"I heard you're kicking ass, man."
jesse,Yeah. You gotta come by my new place.
large,"Yeah, definitely."
jesse,Sorry... you know... I heard.
large,"Oh, thanks... yeah - thanks."
jesse,That's fucked up.
large,Yeah... So I definitely wanna come by and check out your new pad. You gotta tell me what happened.
jesse,"Basically, ""The Man bought my silent Velcro patent."
large,What?
jesse,Well you knew I was an inventor right?
large,No. But I haven't seen you since we
jesse,Oh well yeah... I wasn't really an inventor yet. Anyway I developed this little item that's just like Velcro but doesn't make that annoying Velcro noise.
large,now much did they buy it for?
jesse,A lot.
large,Wow. So what are you doing now?
jesse,Nothing. They laugh.
large,Seriously.
jesse,"Seriously. Absolutely nothing. I've never been so bored in all my life. The first month I bought a whole bunch of shit, but then that got boring. But I... nothing."
large,"That's so crazy. But I mean like, are you gonna travel or like what are you gonna do? Shouldn't you like help starving kids or something?"
jesse,"I'm not really motivated to do much at all. It's kind of funny, I guess I had kind of planned on my whole life being about struggling to get money. But now that I've got more than I ever dreamed, I'm really not sure what to do with myself. I stare at walls a lot."
dave,"Can you believe that shit, Large? This guy has one idea and he's a trillionaire. I got a thousand ideas, but I gotta sit around and wait for all my relatives to die. They join the group. Mark blows coke off a large golf book. Dave has a young girl on his lap. Large begins to notice that the girls in the room, although quite attractive, are pretty young; 17-19. As he pans the room, he lock eyes with a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL. They play chicken briefly to see who will break the stare first. Large does and looks to his right where someone has just passed him a joint- He hits it and passes it on."
mark,"Here, bro. He passes Large the golf book."
large,"Oh no thanks, man."
mark,Really? But you're like a movie star and shit.
large,"No, no thanks."
jesse,Well then here. Eat this. Jesse opens his palm to reveal a tiny hit of E with a SMILEY FACE on it.
large,I guess I'll see youguyslater. He eats the hit. They laugh.
dana,Should we play a game?
dave,other than golf? They laugh.
kelly,"No, let's play Spin The Bottle. The idea is met with mixed reaction from the group."
jesse,"They're all legal. I think. He smiles a toothy grin. KELLY, a young hot girl with a raspy voice takes control."
kelly,"Well we just ate all this fuckin' ex, what the hell else are we gonna do?"
jesse,The girl has a point.
mark,"Okay, how 'bout this. He holds up a bottle of Tequila with a ribbon around !.to neck."
all,Large! He snaps his attention to the game. The bottle is pointed directly at him.
jesse,"Largeman, this is Dana. Large looks over to the sexy young girl whom he locked eyes with before. She smiles at him. Awkwardness fills the room."
dana,Hi.
large," Oh, who's up? They all laugh. She gets up and slowly walks over to the couch. She smiles nervously. Large stares at her. we see in his eyes he's feeling more fucked up every instant. She stands above him at the couch, then straddles him with her knees on either side of his legs; sitting on his lap. The MUSIC PLAYS. Everyone is speechless. she slowly leans in. Eye contact. They kiss softly enjoying every second. Its incredibly sexy."
jesse,"This is gonna be a good night. Everything SPEEDS-UP and SLOWS DOWN. A barrage of images: people hooking up, girls kissing girls, guys feeling girls up, joints being passed, one girl crying, Mark showing off his golf swing, Large trying to take deep breaths, Jesse and Dave hugging, two-figures moving quickly under a blanket. Kenny in full riot gear letting people take turns hitting him in his helmet. FASTER : hands gripping each other, a nose on a neck, hands gripping a waist. Ecu s Largos face as his eyes swim in their eocketo s end the corners of his mouth lift with the idea of a smile.."
carol,"it's good isn't it. No one responds, so Tim nods to be nice."
large,"So, Tim, how long you been working at medieval Times?"
tim,Three years. But I've only been a knight for two. You have to pay your dues. I worked in the stables and helped in the kitchen.
carol,When I started he was making the coleslaw. It hasn't been the same since you got knighted.
tim,I really just stirred it.
carol,Don't be modest. Mr. Modesty won the joust last night.
large,Congratulations.
tim,"It's not that big a deal, it's fixed."
large,"What was it that happened to you in high school? You had a thing, but I forgot what it was."
mark,He got the shit kicked out of him.
carol,No he didn't.
mark,How do you know? He got the shit kicked out of him by Tyrell Freedmen.
large,I remember that. That was sofucked up. Why did he do that?
tim,I fucked him up too.
mark,He knocked your teeth out.
tim,He said I bit off him 'cause I got the same Jordans.
carol,What?
large,That's right.
carol,Who?
tim,Tyrell said I bit off him 'cause I got the same Jordans he did. But his were the red ones and mine were all white.
marx,Yours were red too by the time he was done with you. Everybody laughs but Tim.
tim,"He only chipped one tooth. So what are you up to now, Mark, digging graves? Silence. A SPOON CLANKS on a plate."
carol,Mark's getting into real estate. Silence. Mark FLICKS open his Zippo lighter and lights a cigarette.
large,What?
tim,"No, I can't."
carol,"Yes, you can."
mark,What the fuck is Klingon?
large,Like the Star. Trek guys?
carol,Yup. He can talk in their language.
tim,She's kidding.
carol,"No, I'm not. He's being shy. Are you being shy?"
mark,"Don't be shy, Tim."
large,"Yeah let's hear it, man?"
tim,It's just made up. The guy who plays the wizard at work is a Trekky. I don't really...
carol,He's being shy. Say what you said to me last night.
tim,No.
mars,"Yeah, Tim. Say what you said to her last night. Silence. Everyone stares at Tim."
tim,I gotta get going anyway.
tim,Kuntar peteeky maya. Al fook soo. They all stare at him. Then burst out laughing.
mark,You've got to be kidding me.
carol,"It means, ""I like to mate after battle."""
carol,Yes.
tim,"No, that wasn't the one I said. This one means ""kill Kirk"" and also 'hallelujah"" depending on the context."
mark,"You must have gotten it confused with ""Pleej artulyah. Hagtooth pleep."" Theylaugh."
carol,"That was good, honey."
mark,"You know what that means, Tim?"
tim,"No I don't know the whole language, I just..."
mark,"well I do. It means get the fuck out of my house before I chop your fuckin' head off. Silence. Large stares at Mark in disbelief, then starts to LAUGH. They all start to join him except Mark. They stop laughing."
carol,"Mark, he's a knight."
mark,He's just a fast-food knight.
tim,I should get going anyway. He gets up to leave. But his sword gets caught between his chair and the table. They all watch as he fumbles to undo himself. He's like John Ritter at his finest. Large and Mark just laugh.
mark,My Mom did it.
carol,"What's this? She finds a long, thin cigarette with lipstick on it in the ashtray and lights it."
marx,"What the fuck is that shit, Mom?"
carol,Where's this? Gimme a hit of that.
mark,"Don't bring those fucking people here anymore, Mom. Or I'm leaving. I'm serious. No Medieval Times people in this house. He passes the bong to his Mom. She smokes it, then sits down, forcing them both to slide over. Several cats surround her_"
carol,Did you tell Large about the tapes?
mark,"No, Ma. I'm not doin' the stupid tapes."
large,what are the tapes?
carol,Real estate tapes. You can make up to a hundred thousand your first year. You should have seen the boat this one Oriental had.
mark,"Mom, shut-up about those fucking tapes. It's a scam."
carol,"It's not a scam. They show you how to do it. It's not hard, honey. Then I could retire and we could have our own game show. Carol and Large share a laugh."
mark,In China.
carol,In China is right.
large,"So... what, you like sell property?"
mark,"It's bullshit. You were just all baked,out and you thought it would be a good idea."
carol,Well I'm doin' it. I'm savin' up for those tapes. 'Cause I know what you could be if you just applied yourself.
mark,"I do apply myself, Mom; everyday, I work my ass off burying dead people, okay? I'm only twenty-six, I'm not in any rush. What's your rush for? Just let me be, all right? I don't rush you."
carol,Well then I'm gonna do them then.
mark,Fine. Do'em.
carol,"I will and then I won't let you come on my yacht. Large, you're welcome anytime, but leave your friend behind. Large LAUGHS. She checks her watch."
large,"Yeah. Good to see you too. She gets to the door, then crosses back to Mark."
carol,Don't sit in here all day you guys; I took the batteries outta that carbon monoxide detector 'cause it was beeping all night. She slams the front door.
mark,She drives me crazy. She's gets all fried out and makes me feel like I gotta impress her all the fucking time. And you know what? I'm okay with being unimpressive; I sleep better. Large site forward abruptly.
large,Oh not What time is it ?
large,"Hi, I'm Andrew bargeman. I'm sorry. i'mn a little late for my appointment. She looks at her watch."
large,"Okay, thanks. Sorry."
receptionist,Hi Mrs. Lubin.
receptionist,Just have a seat and we'll be with you soon.
large," Hi, how are you? The dog looks both ways before mounting Large's leg and proceeds to thrust his groin to and fro. Large tries to shove him off. He looks back at the blind woman who stares off in the other direction. Large is about to say something to her but he stops himself."
girl,Kick his balls.
large,I don't want to hurt him.
girl,It's the only way to teach them. I have three Dobermans. If I didn't kick them in the balls regularly I'd never get anything done.
large,"Yeah, but I don't want to like destroy future generations of charitable dogs. Besides he's got to be close to finishing by now."
girl,"Not yet, here comes the lipstick. They sit and watch him go."
receptionist,Mrs. Lubin?
receptionist,We're ready for you.
large,I feel so used.
sam,I recognize you.
large,"Oh, did you go to Columbia High?"
sam,"No, not from high school, from TV. Didn't you play the retarded quarterback."
large, Yeah.
sam,Are you really retarded? He stares at her.
large,No.
sam,"That's cool. Great job, man. You were- I mean I thought you were really retarded. You were just as good as that corky kid and he's really retarded. I mean if there's some kind of like retarded Emmy you could win. You'd kick Corky's ass."
large,"I got to fill this thing out, but thank you for... that."
sam,"Oh, okay. Right on. My cousin's an actor. Jake Ryan Winters. I doubt you'd know him. He was on ""Sheena"" once as some gnome or something. I think that's great though."
large,Thank you.
sam,"Oh that last scene where you make that speech to the whole stadium and your Dad gives you the thumbs up; that was - it was emotional. I mean I didn't cry, but I think my Dad did."
large,Well thanks. Thank you.
sam,So are you doing anything else?
large,No. Not right now I'm just...
sam,Any other retarded roles? I'm sure you could definitely get more of those.
large,"No, I'm just auditioning and.,."
sam,"I can't believe you're not really retarded. Jake's not a very good actor. I mean on ""Sheens"" you couldn't really tell 'cause he was in a hairy gnome suit, but he used to put on these really low-budge renditions of Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals in our attic when we were kids and they were awful. It sucks 'cause there isn't a whole lotta work for little people, you know? Anyway sorry I talk too much, fill out your forms. Large just stares at her. She's funny."
large,What are you listening to?
sam,"""The Shins."" You know them?"
large,No.
sam,"Oh are you kidding me? You gotta here this one song, it'll change your life I promise you. Oh but you have to fill out your forms. Conundrum."
large,That's cool. I like it.
sam,So what are you doing here?
large,What are you doing here?
sam,Waiting for a friend. You?
large,I'm uh... there's a_..
sam,"Fuck, that was nosey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be nosey. That was so nosey."
large,Its al=ight. I... I uh get headaches. So I just wanna have that checked out.
sam,Cool.
receptionist,Andrew Largeman?
large,Yes.
receptionist,We're ready for you.
large,Okay. He stands. He turns to Sam.
sam,You didn't. I'm Sam.
large,Andrew.
large,Thanks.
receptionist,"Don't worry Sam, we'll get to you next. Large turns to Sam. She looks away."
doctor,Mr. Andrew Largeman.
large,Yes - hi.
doctor,There's absolutely nothing wrong with you. Large stares.
large,What?
doctor,"I'm just kidding, how would I know that?"
large,Yeah. They shape hands.
doctor,"I'm Doctor Cohen. What can we do for you today, Andrew?"
large,I've been having these really intense headaches. They only last for a split second and then they're gone. It's like a lightning flash; almost like a surge of electricity and then it's gone. He looks at the chart.
doctor,You're Gideon's kid. I didn't even put the two together.
large,Yeah.
doctor,I'm sorry about you're Mother.
large,Yeah. Thank you.
doctor,I must have missed you at Shiva last night.
large,Yeah.
doctor,So how long have these headaches been going on?
large,Well I think I've had them in some form since I was a little kid. But they've been getting more and more frequent over the last year.
doctor, How long have you been on the Lithium?
large,"Oh uh, I've been on some form of it since I was ten or so."
doctor,"And what about Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, Depakote; did any of that ever help you?"
large,"No. I mean I don't know. It's recently occurred to me that I might not even have a problem. only I'd never know it, because as far back as I can remember I've been medicated. I grew up on it. I left them in LA. This is the first time I haven't had it in my body since I can remember."
doctor,Well it'll leave your body pretty fast. I'll write you a prescription.
large,Actually I. was thinking about taking a little vacation.
doctor,Have you spoken to your psychiatrist about that?
large,"E)h well, my psychiatrist is my Dad. So uh... he... I think he'd prefer me to stay on it. He likes to think it makes me happy. And I let him think that because he's sort of consumed by the idea of making everyone happy."
doctor,"Well look, I'll examine you and give you a Catscan just so you won't worry that it's anything serious. But to be honest, I think the headaches are something else. Our bodies do very funny things when they're consumed with stress and anxiety. Things you'd never expect. I found my ex-best friend's cuff links in my wife's puree and I couldn't get an erection for a year and a half."
large,But that doesn't really feel like it. I mean I don't feel stressed or really anxious at all.
doctor,Well with all the Lithium he's had you on it's amazing you can even hear me right now_
large,"Oh, right."
doctor,"First of all, I do think you need to find a psychiatrist that isn't your father. That just's something that should have been remedied years ago. He knows better. Secondly, I'm not in a position to comment on whether or not you should stay on the meds or not; I don't know your story. But my opinion, since you're paying for it, is that those drugs may help as a means to an end. But if you're not In any sort of therapy, sooner or later what's ever going on in your mind will find a way to peek it's little head out of the water. Just something to think about."
music plays,AN OVERHEAD SHOT OF: Large staring at the wall as he lies on a white slab covered from the waist down by a white towel. AN OLD FEMALE NURSE straps him to the slab ignoring the OBSCENE WORDS and DRAWINGS in black marker that cover his chest. THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN to reveal Large and the slab being sucked.into the Catscan tunnel.
large,Why were you really there?
sam,Charging. I'm a robot.
large,Do you lie a lot?
san,What do you consider a lot?
large,Enough for people to call you a liar.
sam,People call me lots of things.
large,"Is one of them ""liar""?"
sam,"I could say ""no"", but how will you know I'm not lying."
large,Because I`ll choose to trust YOU.
sam,You can do that?
large,I can try.
sam,Who's bike is this?
large,It was my grandfather's. It was the only thing he left to anyone in my family and he left it to me. And I like it.
sam,This is the point where you ask me if I'd like a ride home?
large,It is?
sam,Yup.
large,Would you like a ride home?
sam,"Fine, but I ' m not getting in that sidecar,"
large,Why not?
sam,"Sidecars are for bitches. Anyone who gets in that thing is automatically your bitch. Thus, I will ride on the back. She climbs on the back behind him."
large, What are you like... a hanglider? They drive off.
sam,"I thought my boyfriend was gonna pick me up on his bike, so I brought it... But then he couldn't so..."
large,"So what, it's like one of those tandem things?"
sam,"No, its a Ninja. Way faster than this thing."
large,But what kind of helmet is that?
sam,"You can use it on a motorcycle. Anyway, how's your head?"
large,I should live through the day.
sam,Cool. Make a right here. They stop at a light.
large,Are you doing anything right now?
sam,"Can you elaborate on ""doing anything""?"
large,"Well, I just had this idea. I promised this guy I'd stop by his house that's right up here, but I don't really wanna stay very long. So I was just thinking if you came with me I could say I have to take you home when I'm ready to go."
sam,"Wow. well that's pretty damn random of ya, Andrew."
large,I know.
sam,'Nice to meet you. May I use you?' That's the Hollywood in ya I guess.
large,"No, it's not like that, c'mon. It'll be fun. I promise."
sam,Can we have code names too?
large,If you'd like.
sam,"okay. But don't try and like kidnap me or anything, because my step-uncle's a bounty hunter and I could have you tracked and killed."
large,Liar. The light changes and they drive off.
jesse,"'Kay ready? He unleashes the arrow into the air and the three of them scramble around in terror trying to avoid wherever it will land. It plunges into the earth three feet from Sam's foot. Frozen, she yanks on her ear; hard."
large,I'll be fine. Am I the first boy you've ever brought home?
large,He doesn't drive a bike?
sam,"No, I don't have a boyfriend."
large,Well we're off to a great start.
sam,"okay so sometimes I lie. I'm weird, man. About random stuff too; and I don't even know why I do it. It's like a tick. I swear, sometimes I hear myself say something and then I think: ""Wow, that's not even remotely true."
large,So how am I supposed to know what's real?
sam,"Well, I always feel bad and admit them when they're lies."
large,Open the door.
sam,"Down, Kevin! Mom! Kick their balls! Kick their balls! Anthrax, heel! Mom! Sam tries slapping them on their backs. OLIVIA, Sam's mother, comes rushing in clutching a hamster with a bloody nose."
olivia,Everybody downl Who wants to eat? Do you want to eat? Well then get the fuck off him! Kevin! Steven!
sam,"Mom, this is .Andrew..."
olivia,"Welcome, welcome. The place is a wreck, I'm so sorry. You look very familiar."
sam,He's the retarded quarterback.
olivia,"Shut up ! Oh my God ! You are the retarded quarterback. You were so good on that show. Now I'm really ashamed. Look at this place. And I'm wearing sweat pants. (to Sam, through her teeth, while nodding at"
large,No.
olivia,"Oh, tell me, what's that Alan Thicke like? I've heard he's a cocky son of a bitch."
large,"No, he's a really nice guy."
olivia,"Oh. Well, welcome, welcome. Samantha I told you to take the wheel out of the hamster cage. She holds up a dead hamster."
saki,"I forgot, Mom."
olivia,Well you forgot and now Jelly's dead. Luckily I got peanut Butter out in time.
large,Yes.
olivia,Samantha put the clothes in the dryer and bury Jelly. She kisses Sam on the cheek and then she's gone. They stand there a moment to catch their breath. Then they both start laughing.
sam,Come on in. They walk into the LIVING ROOM.
sam,So this is it.
large,It's nice.
sam,No it's not. You don't have to say that just 'cause you can't think of anything else to say.
large,"I'm not. It's really nice. It's very cozy. You guys are a little early on the tree, huh?"
sam,"Yeah, well we never got around to taking it down, so when it got to be fall again we just figured we might as well leave it. Are you freaked out? You're totally freaked out aren't you?"
large,"No, not at all. I like it."
sam,Wanna see my room?
large,"Yeah, sure. They cross to the staircase and are met by TITEMBAY  a handsome, young Black Man in a sweater carrying books."
sam,"Titembay, this is my friend, Andrew. Andrew this is my brother, Titembay."
large,"Hi, nice to meet you."
sam,"Oh, its okay."
titembay,I saved some mac and cheese for you. It's in the f ridge.
sam,Thanks.
titembay,"Anyway, I'm late for class, it was nice meeting you."
large,"Yeah, you too. They walk up the stairs."
sam,"This is it. She puts on a CD, ."
large,Uhh... It's Titembay right?
sam,"Yeah, it's weird, huh? You're so freaked out right now, you're like running for the door. You can go, don't feel bad."
large,Stop doing that.
sam,What?
large,"That whole thing you just did. Don't do that. I want to be here, and I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to be, okay? Trust me, my family's way more fucked up then yours, okay?"
sam,Yeah.
large,"So, Titembay."
sam,"Yeah, he's my brother."
large,Is he adopted?
sam,"Well kind of. My mom adopted him years ago from Sally Strothers. one of those: For the cost of a cup of coffee a day"" kind of things. where she's like, ""How can you sit there and not help the children?"" And we just couldn't. We couldn't sit there and not help those children. So we sent him letters and pictures for years and then I got really into ice skating and we kind of forgot about'em. Then one day the phone rang and it was Titembay and he was at the dry cleaners around the corner and he said that he was going to school at Rutgers and living in the dorms, but since he was used to living with his tribe he'd much rather live with his family."
large,Wow.
sam,"Yeah and he's been here ever since. He's an amazing guy, you gotta hear some of his stories. I mean this guy struggled through so much because he wanted to learn. I think of what he's accomplished and I just feel so lazy. He's studying criminal justice at Rutgers right now and when he was a baby he was one of those kids with flies all over his face."
large,Wow. I mean that's great. It's a crazy story.
sam,"That, my friend, is a true story. I'm not that good- A pause. Sam sits on the bed. THE AWESOKE MUSIC PLAYS. She breaks the moment by pulling a small tattered piece of satin fabric off the bed."
large,What is Tickle?
sam,Tickle is my favorite thing in the whole world. It's all that's left of Nannie... my blanket.
large,And Tickle is all that remains?
sam,Yeah.
large,Was there a hurricane or something?
large,It's like the Wailing Wall.
sam,What?
large,The Wailing Wall. It's like the most holy place for Jews to go and pray in Israel. It's all that's left of this enormous temple that was destroyed by the Romans.
sam,"Wow, so you're like really Jewish? Large laughs."
large,"No I'm not. I mean I'm Jewish, but I'm not really Jewish. I don't do anything Jewish. I don't go to temple or anything. But I don't know any Jews who go to temple. The Jews I know only go on Yom Kippur. One day; the day of repentance. Did you know that most temples are designed with movable walls so that on the one day of the year when everyone comes to repent they can actually make the room big enough to hold everyone?"
sam,I don't really believe in God.
large,Just tickle.
sam,"Oh, I believe in Tickle_ They laugh. A nice moment. They hold eye contact. THE AWESOME"
large,What?
sam,"I'm sorry, I just totally ruined the moment didn't I?"
large,"No, I wasn't..."
sam,I just mean we're not gonna like make out.
large,Okay. I hadn't planned on...
sam,"I didn't mean to put that out there, that was lame. BLAAAAHRH. That was so dumb. You know what I do when I'm feeling completely unoriginal? She stands up and does really weird gestures with her hands."
large,So no one has ever done that?
sam,"Not in this spot, no. You just witnessed a completely original moment in history. It's refreshing. You try one."
large,No.
sam,Come on.
large,No. Trust me yours was good enough for both of us.
sam,"Come on. What are you shy? This is your chance to do something that has never, ever been done before and will never be copied throughout human existence. If nothing else, you'll be remembered as the only person who ever did this. He stares at her. She's not gonna let up. Large lifts his index finger in the air and twirlsa it."
large,ZzzZzz. Be stares at her.
sam,"Oh, I've done that one before. She bursts out laughing. He smiles. SAM  So I got to bury this hamster before the dogs eat him. You warms help?"
large,Wow.
sam,Yeah.
large,I mean this is...
sam,I know. They stand in silence.
large,Now?
sam,Yes.
large,Right now?
sam,No. A second ago before I asked.
large,Uh... Right now I was thinking... I was thinking that I've been going to a lot of these things lately.
sam,"What, dates?"
large,"No, not dates. This isn't a date. Is this a date? Funerals."
sam,Oh. Who else died?
large,"No, it's okay. It's okay actually. I'm all right with it. Anyway I think it's what she wanted so..,"
sam,How did she die? Large thinks about that.
large,"No, its okay. She uh... she drowned actually. Sam's jaw drops."
sam,When?
large,This was uh... Hmm... Sunday.
sam,Oh my God. Tears roll down her face.
large, Why are you crying?
sam,"I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm not usually like this. It's just so sad. It's so tragic. Isn't it? It is. It's like real life tragedy or something."
large,"Look, let's change the subject, okay? Let's really bring the focus back to Jelly. I mean what could be ruder than talking about someone else who died while you're in the act of burying a close friend. Sam places the box in the hole she's dug."
sam,What should we do?
large,"Well IIve only been to one of these things,  you appear to be the expert."
sam,We usually say something.
large,"okay, well I'll go first. I didn't really know you, Jelly. But from what I hear, you were a good pet. Had a little trouble with the wheel..."
sam,its not funny. Jelly you were a great pet. Tears roll down her face.
tired man,"Avi wants his Bar Mitzvah theme to be musicals. As in Broadway musicals. Can you believe that? Paul's kid's theme was the Meta; I got to do the Elora with Mookie Wilson. Miriam and I were at one last weekend at the Pierre; whole thing was like a winter wonderland... live penguins wearing yalmulkas. Now me, I got to lay out ten grand alone for some asshole to build a barricade of French garbage across the boccie lanes at my tennis club. THE CAMERA PICKS UP LARGE holding a plate of food: as he approaches Cynthia. She sits alone with a big photo album on her lap."
large,I was just thinking-
cynthia,Oh please be a little more interesting than that.
large,Miss me?
cynthia,No. Me?
large,No.
cynthia,She made you.
large,some trophy. I do have to say I'm impressed with the turnout.
cynthia,"What, you didn't think people would come?"
large,Seems to me the only thing more depressing than a funeral is a funeral where no one shows up. Don't you ever think about who'll show up to yours?
cynthia,"No. Right now I'm alive, so I think about living."
large,"It's one way to determine who your friends are. The people who'd show up at my funeral if it was held in their state, that's one level of friend. But my real friends, the people who really love me, they'd come if it was on the other side of the country."
cynthia,So where do I fall into that?
large,You'd be there.
cynthia,Oh you think so?
large,"I do. I think you'd show up because the truth is, that you really did miss met you always thought of me as the brother you never had. But you've got too much pride to let me know that. You want to pout 'cause I don't return your calls."
cynthia,you're way more talkative than I remember.
large,Today I've been more talkative than I remember.
cynthia,What about mine?
large,"Funeral? Honestly? I probably wouldn't travel for it- no. But don't worry, I'm sure you'll have a great turnout."
cynthia,Why do you say that?
large,"'Cause there's also the guy who lives his life to insure a good turnout. I think that's how my Dad lives his-, like he's sort of writing his own eulogy as he goes and making life choices dependent on how it will sound in a speech."
cynthia,Are you implying that that's why I'm going to med school or something?
large,I'm just saying a lot of people - not necessarily you - a lot of people try and accumulate accolades that will somehow justify their lives.
cynthia,It's said we spend ninety-five percent of our lives trying to look good.
large,Where do I sign up for not caring?
cynthia,How about sucking it up and really having it out with your Dad? That would be a tremendous step towards not needing to look good.
large,"Wow, that was so clever how you did that. Is he grooming you to be a psychiatrist too? Med school's one thing, but please don't become him."
cynthia,He's one of the most caring people I've ever met.
large,"well you would say that; you're the son and daughter he never had. Hell, you're the family he never had. Has he got you on Lithium yet? Wait till he does, you'll love him even more. He stands."
cynthia,"I bet my Mom a dollar you were coming home with a message. I said after nine years, he's definitely coming home with a message."
large,i looked for a message; I got bored and became an actor. He leaves.
large,Hello?
large,"Holy shit, you scared the shit out of me. He covertly slips the perfume bottle into his pocket."
gideon,Just wake up?
large,Yeah.
gideon,Sleep all right?
large,Yeah... fine.
gideon,Mmmm.
large,Yeah. Silence. The FAUCET DRIPS. They avoid eye contact.
gideon,Janice will make you some lunch.
large,Yeah... good.
gideon,Well I guess it's breakfast for you. What time is it?
large,Yeah. Silence. DRIP. DRIP
gideon,No I can. I know. I figured you would want to...
large,But we don't have to do it now. I mean you don't have to do that now. It's just at some point I would... I have some questions.
gideon,I knew that you would. Silence.
large,So she didn't yell or...
gideon,No. I didn't hear anything. The TV was on pretty loud. I always watch the weather report before I go to sleep.
large,It's just weird.
gideon,What?
large,"I don't know, it's just that you'd think if someone was really drowning to death they would scream. I mean really scream from the terror of it all, you know? They would splash and scream I would think; I would have thought."
gideon,"I would have too, but no. Nothing.  What?"
large,Don't take this the wrong way.
gideon,What ?
large,"I'm not reading into this, I'm just thinking out loud so don't get"
gideon,What? No.
large,What?
gideon,Its not that.
large,I'm just saying did they check? I mean has someone ruled that out?
gideon,"No. Because they know she drowned, Andrew."
large,I'm just saying the facts.
gideon,No.
large,And I suppose it doesn't even really matter. But I'd be curious to know. I would like to know if that's what happened; just for me. I mean would that surprise you?
gideon,No. Yee!
large,She made it very clear to everyone she knew that nothing was ever going to make her happy-
gideon,I know! Do you think I don't know?!
large,And c'mon let's be honest; she tried it before.
gideon,Shut-up! .lust shut your fucking mouth. Large is taken aback.
large,I think I deserve to know the truth.
gideon,"You want to make her crazy. Why? Does that make it easier for you? Tears stream down Gideon's face, He sits down on the toilet and cries."
mark,How could you leave all that Lithium? I was totally gonna hit you up for some.
jesse,"This fuckin' guy. I'm glad you're back, man, because this town is so messed up. Everyone's got there drug of choice like in ""Brave New World"". Did you ever read that book? Who wrote that? Aldous something. Aldous-"
large,"I don't know. Jesse continues talking, but his voice distorts into WARBLED"
nonsense as,SLOW MOTION: LARGE STARES in shock as Mark drops a WEDDING RING into the PILE OF JEWELRY he's stealing off the corpse.
olivia,Andrew would you like to see Sam's ice skating tape?
sam,"Mom, no."
large,Absolutely.
olivia,She was so ahead of her time. She could have gone to the Olympics.
sam,"No, I couldn't have."
olivia,"Yes, you could have. Don't blame it on the epilepsy, you had a gift. Large looks to Sam, but she avoids eye contact with him-"
large,C'mon let me see it.
olivia,"Let's just show him the ""Florida Stars of the Ice"" opening; the Gator costume."
sam,Mom. I'm asking you seriously.
large,Don't be shy. Just let me see it.
olivia,"Oh, she wants you to see it. How could you not want him to see how talented you are?"
sam,"Were. They cross to the TV room where they find Titembay wearing rubber gloves, seated next to an open tool box, dusting the coffee table for fingerprints and referring to an open text book. White powder reveals fingerprints  everywhere, including the TV screen."
olivia,Honey what are you doing?
titembay,I'm dusting for prints.
olivia,Well do you think we could move the crime scene to the kitchen? I want to show Andrew Sam skating.
titemhay,But someone's been pissing on my Gamecube and I'm about to close the case.
olivia,It wasn't me your honor.
titembay,The pawprints point to a canine.
olivia,Andrew come sit down here next to me. Large sits next to Olivia on the couch between snoring Dobermans. He places his glass of water on the table. Sam stands in the doorway.
sam,I can't believe you're showing him this.
olivia,There she is.
large,You're the alligator?
olivia,"You can tell by the hands. The alligator skates in and out of the white fingerprints on the TV screen to classical music. We begin to see that Sam is a talented skater. In a very odd way, it's beautiful."
titembay,Here comes the Double Axle...
olivia,"And... land! I mean come on. Isn't she good? Large, Titembay and Olivia APPLAUD. As they do, the LIGHTS in the room SWITCH ON and OFF. Titembay CLAPS twice to turn them back on."
large,That was so good. You're Mom's right you were amazing. Titembay has begun brushing white powder on Large's water glass revealing his fingerprints.
sam,"Okay this was great, but we have to go now."
olivia,"All right, well I just wanted to show you how talented she is. My baby."
sam,Mom.
olivia,"Okay get out of here. Wait, Give me a hug. Sam crosses to her mom. They hug."
sam,I love you too. Olivia kisses Sam on her forehead.
olivia,"Okay, have a good night. She pats Sam's butt as she walks toward the door."
large,Bye. Thank you so much for dinner.
olivia,"C'mon, you're giving me a hug too."
sam,Mom.
large,I'll take a hug. They embrace.
sam,"Okay, good-night.  Night, Tim."
large,Good-Night.
large,It was the only thing I ever really liked doing; pretending to be someone else.
sam,Oh c'mon. Don't ya see that it's a joke. If you can't laugh at yourself life's gonna seem a lot longer than you'd like.
large,So what should we laugh at you about?
sam,I lied again. I have epilepsy.
large,Which part are we laughing about?
sam,"I had a seizure in the law office where I work and they said their insurance would only cover me if I wore ""preventative covering""."
large,Preventative covering?
sam,The helmet I was carrying. Large is silent.
large,I haven't cried since I was a little kid. I didn't cry at my mother's funeral. I wanted to-
sam,What do you mean?
large,"Oh, no. Mark, Dave and Jesse appear with some others."
mark,Hey. Nice to meet you.
jesse,Hey.
dave,T'sup.
mark,"I'm sorry I yelled- 'vagina' just now, I didn't see you."
sam,It's okay.
mark,Nice. Let's get fucked up. Off Large's smile we:
mark,"One, two, three! Everyone jumps into the pool SCREAMING except for Large. He stands there staring at the water."
sam,Hey! what are you doing?
dave,"Largeman, get the fuck in the pool."
girl,"oh, it's so warm!"
sam,Can you swim?
large,'Course I can swim. JUMP CUT TO. Large in the shallow-end doing the most pathetic doggy paddle you've ever seen. Everyone stares in disbelief.
jesse,Dude maybe you should stay on the steps; I don't know CPR.
mark,You look like a drunken beaver. They all laugh- Sam swims over to him sitting on the steps. She smiles at him.
large, I never learned how to swim.
sam,Fooled me. I thought you just had a cramp.
large,There's a handful of normal kid things I kinda missed.
sam,There's a handful of normal kid things I kinda wish I'd missed. She floats on her back beside him.
large,Probably till my fingers get wrinkly.
sam," No, I mean in Jersey."
large,"Oh. I think I'll probably head home the day after tomorrow. well, LA. That's not my home. Rer smile fades."
sam,I still feel at home in my house.
large,"You'll gee when you move out. It just kind of happens one day and it's gone. And you feel like you can never get it back. it's like you feel homesick for a place that doesn't even exist. But maybe it's like this rite of passage, you know? And you won't ever have that feeling again until you create a A new idea of ""home"" for yourself, for the family you start, for your kids. It's like this cycle."
sam,Maybe.
mark,How 'bout some fucking furniture dude.
jesse,I bought a chair but I didn't like it.
sam,Where is it?
jesse,Its keeping us warm.
mark,"Silent Velcro. Lucky motherfucker. I got an idea: loud tape, we'll make millions."
large,I feel like if I had showed up at school and presented the idea of silent Velcro they would have sent me away a whole lot sooner. They all laugh.
sam,So why did they send you away? She takes a sip of her beer.
jesse,"Whoa, listen to this girl."
large,They didn't send me away.
mark,You're the one who said they sent you away.
large,"I mean they did, but... they sent me to boarding school. ""Sent me away"" implies I went to some asylum or something. There were no straps involved."
sam,Why did they send you to boarding school? Large looks to Jesse and Mark.
large,They sent me to boarding school because uh... they thought I might be dangerous.
mark,I'm dangerous and I didn't get to go to boarding school.
large,I was a kid and I was - they just... I was a teenager and they were depressed and it just wasn't a good combo.
sam,But obviously something happened. I mean there must have been an event.
jesse,You're like a little detective.
large,I know. You and Titembay should go into business together; solve mysteries out of a van.
sam,Am I being too nosey?
large,No. No. I just... it's fine.. I just haven't ever really talked about it.
jesse,"To be honest, I never really knew either. I mean I heard stories."
large,You wanna know?
sam,Yeah.
large,"Really, really?"
mark,You're gay.
large,No. Drumroll... I was the reason she was in a wheelchair.
sam,Shut up.
marx,Fuck you.
large,"No, it's the truth."
sam,Why?
large,It was a complete freak accident. I mean its one of those things that you replay a million times in your head and you see so clearly what a freak thing it was. I... Say whole life she was depressed for no reason. Look at this picture. He pulls the picture of he and Cynthia as children wearing chicken slippers out of his wallet.
sam,You couldn't make her happy.
large,"Yeah. Fuck yeah. And any other time, she would have just yelled at me and sent me to my room, but this time, in that moment, the door of the dishwasher was open. The latch on it was broken and it would just randomly fall open. That fucking latch; it's funny how so much of my life hasbeendetermined by a quarterinchpiece of plastic. So she fellbackover the door and her neck hitthekitchen counter; paralyzing her from the waist down. Sam's eyes are wide in shock."
sam,Oh my God.
large,Still want to compare fucked up families?
jesse,But your Mom was in the wheelchair long before you left.
large,"Well I was nine. They sent me to therapy and my Father put me on these drugs that were supposed to ""curb my anger"". And I've been on some form of them ever since. My Mother who was clinically depressed before the accident, sank even lower to the point where she just ignored everyone but our housekeeper, Janice and her daughter, Cynthia. And when I was sixteen my psychiatrist Dad came around to the conclusion that it might not be the healthiest environment for me to be growing up in. So he sent me to boarding school. And I haven't been home since."
sam,Until now.
mark,For her funeral.
large,"Until now for her funeral. I'm off to a ripping start in this life, huh? Next time through I think I'll lay low out of the gate. He takes a sip of his beer."
sam,It sounds like a punishment.
large,I think it was. So I left them in LA. I'm taking myself off punishment.
mark,Please don't remind me.
jesse,"All he heard of that whole story was ""left drugs in LA""."
mark,Fuck you.
jesse,Crackhead. A 19 year old girl from the pool comes around the corner
girl,Mark? Where's the sauna? Mark and Jesse look at each other. They race towards her tripping drunkenly on towels and pushing each other out of the way. Sam smiles at Large. Her face glowswarm from the fire.
large,What?
sam,"You're ""in it"" right now aren't you?"
large,what do you mean?
sam,"My Mom always says that when she can see I'm like working something big out she'll say, ""Are you in it right now?"" And I look at you, and you tell me this story and... you're... you're definitely ""in it"" right now."
large,"I think you're right. I'm ""in it"". But I'm so glad I'm ""in it"" 'cause I'm working it all out, you know? I haven't swallowed a pill in four days now and I can already feel this eerie clarity. It's probably the reason I just can't stop fucking talking; these.rusty cogs in my brain have started spinning... fast."
sam,Maybe that's why you've been getting those headaches.
large,Alright can we just forget about all that stuff please and talk about good etuff.
sam,Good stuff?
large,"Yeah, glass half-full shit. What do you got?"
sam,I got a little buzz. That's what I've got. What do you got?
large,I got a little buzz going.
large,"Ah! Jesus, you scared the shit out of me. You're always doing that. Why are you always doing that?"
gideon,I haven't seen you in awhile.
large,Yeah I've been kind of catching up with people around here.
gideon,Dr. Cohen called. There's nothing wrong with you.
large,Yeah I think I'm starting to figure that out myself.
gideon,when are you thinking of leaving?
large,I think probably tomorrow. I gotta lot of stuff I got to do back in LA. I'm gonna have to find a new job. So...
gideon,We need to talk.
large,Yeah. How? I mean when?
gideon,what are you doing... now?
large,Well actually I was supposed to meet my friend Mark. But how about later tonight?
gideon,okay. And well talk. we owe that to each other.
large,Yeah.
gideon,We owe it to her.
large,Yeah.
gideon,Good.
marx,Don't mesa with all my shit; what are you. doing? Large picks up a small brown egg wearing tiny clothes.
large,You still have your egg baby? Mine broke the first day.
mark,Don't you fail if it breaks?
large,"Yeah, well she gave us a C cause my partner fell on some ice. My-wife tell on some ice and killed our egg baby."
mark,Jesse cooked his. They both laugh.
large,Why's it brown?
mark,'Cause my wife was Tanisha Lubin.
large,Oh. Large laughs at Mark's earnestness.
mark,He's a boy. His name's Shantel.
large,"It's a girl, she's wearin' a skirt."
mark,They're shorts.
large,Shorts?
mark,"Yeah, he's a boy, Shantel. They're shorts."
large,Oh. They laugh. Large flips through an album.
mark,"Fuck yeah, dude. Those are collectors items. Do you have any idea how much those things will be worth some day."
large,Really?
mark,Hell yeah. That shit's like an investment. I have lots of little investments - all over the place. I'm gonna sel3. 'em all one day and just live off 'em.
large,So like how much is this one worth?
mark,Which?
large,"""Night Vision Goggles."""
mark,"I don't know. Mint; maybe two, three."
large,Dollars?
mark,"Yeah. But it's too early. You don't sell'em yet. Don't you know anything about investing. I'm gonna live off that shit. That ""Schwarzkopf"" card is worth at least five something. And if you have the complete set it's worth like thousands."
large,So do you have the complete set?
mark,"Almost. The corners are bent on my ""Friendly Fire"" and someone stole my ""Wolf Blitzer""."
large,Someone stole it?
mark,"One of my Mom's Medieval Times friends, man. Drug addicts."
large,For drugs they sold it?
mark,Yeah.
large,Wolf Blitzer.
mark,"It doesn't matter if you're a rich house wife looking for your muscle relaxers or some crack head drying cars: people will do anything in this town to get their drug money. Now look, what do you gotta do today? I gotta little going away present for you. But I kinds gotta track it down. So, can you give me a ride?"
large,"Yeah, sure I just..."
mark,What?
large,Nothing I just...
mark,Say it... speak.
large,"Nothing I just, I told Sam I was gonna hang out with her today..."
mark,"She can come, I don't care."
large,What are we doing in the mall. I don't wanna be in the fucking mall.
mark,We're making some money for your present. Just don't look so guilty.
large,"What do you mean, how do I look guilty?"
mark,"Oh, no. Benson."
large,"Oh, no."
sam,Who's that?
mark,Don't give him your number. Karl approaches.
karl,"Hey, what's up, man."
large,Hey.
karl,"Holy shit, I haven't seen you since like junior year."
large,I know.
karl,I thought you killed yourself.
large,What?
karl,"I thought you killed yourself, that wasn't you?"
karl,Who killed themselves?
mark,"Just that Gleason kid. Oh, and Tina."
large,Tina who?
mark,You remember Tina. She was like anorexic. She did gymnastics... Sam is horrified by this conversation.
large,"oh yeah, gymnastics Tina. How'd she do it?"
mark,"I don't know. She wasn't Jewish, I didn't bury her."
karl,"I think sleeping pills. or that car in the garage thing. I forgot. Sam is yanking on her ear for Large to see, but he doesn't notice."
large,This is Sam. Sam this is Karl.
sam,Hey.
mark,Listen I'm gonna go grab that thing. So just hang here and I'll be back.
large,Oh. He walks off.
karl,He's such a dick.'
large,Why'd you say that?
karl,He stole my little brother's last dose of Ritalin and the little fucker glued his lips closed. Weren't you on TV or something?
large,"Yeah. Yeah I was. Just this thing. So you're like what, working here?"
large,"Yeah, definitely."
karl,"Oh, washers. I'm s'posed to count'em."
large,Washers?
karl, You know these little round metal things you put between a bolt and a nut.
large,"Oh, washers. I never use those. I never knew what they were for, so. I just always threw them away. I never used washers. Silence."
karl,"Oh, well listen, I want to talk to you both about a good opportunity. (like he's memorized it"
mark,Hey. We gotta get going.
large,"Yeah, well it was great to see you, man. I'm sure I'll see you around."
karl,"Yeah, well let me get your number."
large,"oh, well we gotta run. I'm listed. Just call information. It's been so long since I've been home I don't even remember it."
sam,Nice meeting you.
mark,Why is it always the losers who get into the pyramid schemes? Why isn't it ever some charming hot girl nagging you incessantly to buy shit?
large,"Oh, is that what it is?"
mark,"Detergent or some shit. The thing I don't understand is, if it worked, why would he be working here. The guy's a freak; he pops Darvocet like it's Ritalin."
large,Why are you buying knives? I don't need knives. They arrive at the counter. A young Black woman with enormous gold earrings and long fingernails stands at the register.
mark,I'd like to return these.
woman,You got a receipt.
mark,"Actually, no. It was a gift. She clicks her tongue. She begins filling out a form."
woman,Why are you returning these?
mark,They're not sharp enough.
woman,They're not sharp enough?
mark,No. Not for what we need them for. They couldn't cut cans.
woman,You bought them to cut cans?
mark,"No, but in the commercial they say that if I wanted to cut cans I could. But with these knives I can't."
woman,Well it comes with a sharpener. Did you try it?
mark,"Yeah, they're just... I don't want them; not sharp enough. She rings it into the register and counts out bills to Mark."
woman,"Thirty-nine, fifty-three. I hope we came in handy at Handi-World. Please come again. They exit the store and enter the mall."
mark,A major loop-hole in the Handi- World return policy permits returns without receipts on items below forty dollars.
large,So how often do you go?
mark,"I hit every employee once, then wait for them to. hire. new ones. Luckily, no one works at Handi- World for very long. Except Karl Benson."
large,"You know, Mark, it's my last day in town. I have money. I can give you some."
mark,"I don't need your money, I'm making my own right now."
large,"Or fuck, take Jesse's - the guys a millionaire."
mark,"i don't take anybody's money, Andrew. I make my own. Favors are bad news. And the only thing worse than a favor, is a favor involving money."
mark,This will only take a second.
large,This is Sam.
sam,Hi.
cynthia,Hey.
cynthia,She... had an eight pound boy.
sam,You delivered him?
cynthia,Yeah.
sam,Wow.
cynthia,Yeah.
large,Mark's picking up something.
cynthia,He's as friendly as always. The three stand in awkward silence.
large,So were you there?
cynthia,Where?
large,Were you on the call to my uh... to the house?
cynthia,No.
large,Ch.
cynthia,Do you wish I was?
large,Yeah.
mark,"Got it, let's go."
sam,Nice to meet you.
cynthia,You too. Sam leaves them alone.
large,I should go.
large,You know me enough to know I'd travel for your funeral right? I was kidding yesterday; where ever it was... you know I'd be there right?
cynthia,"Yes. He backs away and mounts his bike. Cynthia turns to the stretcher and quickly uses her thumb to swipe a tear,welling in her eye."
mark,"I've got that Nitrous tank for you, so can I get that info?"
diego,You're gonna have to wait a couple. The HOOKER MOANS.
mark,Dude we're kind of in a rush.
diego,"You can wait, he's about to cunt."
greaseball,"I'm gonna fucking cum! Diegogestures, ""Told you."""
hooker,"Cum on my back! The group responds in silent shock. Jaws drop, Diego grabs his hair with his fists. Just as they are about to climax, we"
mark,Wow.
diego,That shit was hot! I got to go drop some knowledge on that ho.
sam,How do you know she's a hooker?
diego,"of course she's a fucking hooker. Girls that look like her do not fuck guys that look like him unless it's for money, coke or fame."
sam,Julia Roberts married Lyle Lovett.
diego,Who the fuck are you?
marx,"Oh, this is Sam and Large."
diego,No offense.
mark,"He's the guy who needs that thing. Look I brought you the tank, so can you just tell us where to go now?"
diego,Tank come with balloons?
marx,"Am I a fucking birthday clown, Diego? No I don't have balloons. Suck it off the tap. And I need it back when you're done; the guy's holding my thirty-nine bucks."
diego,All right. Hold-up. Who here just saw some titties?! They all stare.
mark,we're in a hurry.
diego,All right. You know where Kiernan's Quarry is?
large,"Okay, stop. What the fuck are we doing?"
marx,Just be patient.
large,"Dude, we've been patient all day, but it's my last day in town and you haven't told me what the fuck we're doing. I mean if you told me we were going on a six hour scavenger hunt for blow I would have passed."
mark,Blow? Please. If I was gonna give you coke we'd have gone to the high school football practice and we'd a been reeling five hours ago.
large,Well I think we've corrupted this innocent girl enough for one afternoon.
sam,I'm not innocent.
large," Yes, you are. And that's what I like about you. And I don't want this fucking guy taking you to the bottom of a quarry in a sketchy-ass neighborhood to find some Pitbull's raping each other or... crack whore's huffing turpentine or whatever it is that you have us"
mark,Wow. That's the most worked up I've ever seen you.
sam,He was protecting me.
large,So.
sam,He likes me.
large,Don't be cute.
sam,You're my knight in shining armor.
large,Don't talk about knights in front of Mark. It's a sore subject.
mark,I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.
large,Pun intended? Beat as Mark gets it. He comes after him.
mark,You're dead. They play wrestle as Sam watches.
sam,Wow.
large,I never even knew this was here.
mark,I've heard about it. They were supposed to build a mall here I think.
sam,Yeah I remember reading about it in the paper.
large,Can you imagine the guy who's job it is to fight for the right to build his mall on some like geological phenomenon?
mark,They love their mall's here man. Okay let's just find this guy and get outta here.
large,You're not gonna tell us what we're getting?
mark,"It's a surprise, you'll see. Mark walks on ahead of them down a path that winds down alongside the abyss."
mark,I guess this is it.
large,"So... knock. Knock and barter for ""Dessert Storm Trading Cards""."
mary,Please don't tease me about my hobbies. I don't tease you about being an asshole. They stand in the pouring rain staring at the boat. Mark steps up and pounds his fist on the wooden hull.
albert, Mark?
mark,Yeah. Are you Albert?
albert," Yes. Come on in out of the rain. Sam and Large look at each other, then follow Mark up an A- frame ladder that sits next to the hull."
albert,You guys must be freezing. Make yourselves warm by the fire. I'm just gonna go put her down. I'll be right out. The three of them huddle by the fire. They speak in quiet whispers.
sam,"I must say, I've been continually impressed today with how each new place you bring us manages to be weirder and weirder."
mark,"What do you mean, this is nice."
large,"ah nothing, just hanging out in an old boat at the bottom of a quarry in Newark."
mark,"It's hardly the bottom, dude. Did you see that cliff? Albert returns with FAYE, an equally gentle and caring looking woman in her early thirties."
albert,"This is my wife, Faye."
all,Hi. Hello.
faye,Hi. Welcome.
albert,"This is Mark and Sam and Large, right?"
albert,"Diego told me when he called. Please have a seat, make yourselves comfortable."
faye,"Its really coming down out there, huh?"
large,"Yeah, it just started pouring all of a sudden."
albert,"Well in a bad storm I like to pretend this old boat's my own private ""ark"". Unfortunately, if this is the apocalypse, I'm not quite sure it still floats."
faye,Would any of you like some tea?
sam,I'd love some tea. Large and Mark look at her.
large,No thanks.
marx,No.. thanks. Faye crosses to a small kitchen. They all sit there politely nodding at each other.
large,What is it that you do here? What is this place?
albert,Good question. We're calling it Kiernan's Fault. And no one's really quite sure what it is because they haven't been able to explore it. They're locked in a legal battle over who has the rights to the land.
large,Oh. Wow.
albert,"What they don't know is that I'm a geologist working undercover for the preservation lobby. So, at night... I go down."
faye,He's documenting it to support their case.
sam,Wow. So how deep does it go?
albert,No one really knows. I've been in the furthest and that was about two miles down. But I like to pretend it's infinite.
sam,It's kind of an odd job isn't it? Guardian of an infinite abyss?
albert,"Yeah, I guess it is. We also trade and deal in antique jewelry. I suppose it's pretty odd for you that we live down here like this-"
sam,No.
large,Not at all.
mark,Never crossed my mind.
albert,But we think it's important.
large,Why? What do you think you'll find?
albert,I don't know. It's exciting. New frontiers are hard to come by these days. I guess I just like the idea of discovering something.
large,"Yeah. ""Albert's Abyss""."
albert,"Who knows? Maybe. But I used to think that was all that mattered. No matter what it was, as long as I could put my name on it. Like it would somehow justify the fact that I lived; that I was here. ""I did that. That's mine. I got this plate on my travels."" But you know what? That's all ego; none of that stuff really matters. If at the end of the day I get to be with her, if I get to be with this person right here and the baby we created, then that's all I need. Just having felt that... If I die in an hour, I know I've lived. Faye kisses his forehead."
large,"You know ""my whole life I've had that same anxiety that if I didn't discover something or... save something or..."
sam,Save something from being discovered.
large,"Yeah. That I'll have somehow wasted my time here. And that somewhere, whatever force created us, would resent me for it."
albert,"Well I think that force would rather remind you that ""breathing's all it takes to be a miracle"". He takes a deep breath. Large, Sam and mark stare at Albert; TRANSFIXED. He's like a sage."
albert,Well i suppose you want what you came all the way down here for.
marx,"Yeah, that would be great."
albert,It took me awhile to track this piece down. But I owe Diego huge. He pulls a small paper bag off the counter and hands it to Mark. Mark looks inside and nods his head.
mark,That's it. Thank you. They all stand.
sam,Well thank you for the tea.
large,"Yeah, thanks."
faye,"Okay, good luck in the rain. Would you like some garbage bags or something?"
large,"Yeah, that would be great."
albert,Good-bye. Albert stands with his arm around Faye in their warm doorway. As the three of them climb down the ladder and head up the path. Large turns back' around.
large," r, Hey Albert l"
albert,Yeah?
large,Good luck exploring the infinite
albert, Thank you.
large,So I don't know if I'm gonna see you.
mark,I know. Don't you wanna know what's in the bag?
large,"To be honest, I don't even care anymore. Mark pulls out the bag. It practically falls apart it's 80 wet from the rain. He pulls out an ANTIQUE NECKLACE with a square pendant on it. He puts it in Large's wet hand."
mark,I'd be lying to ya if I told ya this was my plan all along.
large,This whole day was about this?
sam,What is it?
large,It's my Mom's favorite necklace.
large,No. I don't want to play this game.
sam,"Why not? I'm curious. She's sitting here, across from you and you can say anything at all. All the things you never got a chance to say."
large,Okay.
sam,What?
large,I really don't wanna...
sam,"Oh, my God, Large I think I see one."
large,Shut-up.
sam,"Yeah, I do. Don't move, we should save it or something. She finds a clear plastic cup."
large,"I guess I could put it in my scrapbook, if I had a scrapbook. They wait."
sam,Is that it?
large,I think so. I don't feel any more coming.
sam,"Well if you do, let me know and I'll grab the cup, okay?"
large,Yeah.
sam,This was a good idea. Keep talking.
large,"It's funny; this thing reminds me of this really random memory of my mother. Its so weird, I haven't thought about this in so long, but this great memory I have where I was a little kid and I was crying for one reason or another and she was kind of holding me and rocking me back and forth. And I could see the little balls in this thing just rolling back and forth. And there was just snot dripping down my nose."
sam,"oh, Large I'm never gonna be able to get all these. They laugh. She moves closer, wrapping her legs around his waist to hug him close. She kisses his-'wet cheeks."
large,"It's so funny isn't it? But I think that's the single most amazing moment I remember of my Mother. 'Cause she wasn't sad and she wasn't being prodded to be happy, she was just there."
sam,To be your Mom.
sam,Just let it all go. He cries with his elbow over his eyes.
large, I would say that it's Love.
sam,"Yeah, it is."
large,This fucking hurts.
sam,I know. But that... that is life. if nothing else...  That is life. St's real. And sometimes it burns. But maybe... it might be all there is.
large,"Fuck. I feel like I just get so much thrown at me; like there's so much speeding by me in a day that I feel like if I look up from the sidewalk, I'll get dizzy and fall down. So it's like I just... barrel through and don't look up, so I'll just never fall, you know? And that's really... and you know it's so sad to say this, but that's really how I've been living my whole life."
sam,Trying to barrel through.
large,Yeah.
sam,Well it sounds like you were due to fall.
large,Yeah.
sam,How do you feel? On Large's face as he thinks about that question.
large,Safe.
large,Dad? He sits up startled.
gideon,"Oh, hey, hey c'mon in. He finds his glasses on his chest and lifts the remote to turn off the TV."
large,Sorry to wake you.
gideon,"No, no, it's uh... I was just reading."
large,I've been on a pretty crazy little journey these last couple of days.
gideon,You've been avoiding me.
large,"No, I just... maybe I have been."
gideon,"I'm sure you can find plenty of things in your life to be angry about, but what I don't understand is why you're so angry at me. All I ever wanted was for everybody to be happy again, Andrew. That's all I ever wanted."
large,"But when were we ever all happy, Dad? I mean you always say that, but when was that? When was this time that you have in your mind that you wish we could all get back to? 'Cause I don't have it in my memory. Maybe if I did I could help steer us back there. But we should..."
gideon,Well we might have a shot at it if you could just forgive yourself for what you did.
large,"What I did? What I did?! You know what, Dad? I'm gonna forgive myself for what I did right now: I was a little boy and somebody made a shitty latch. That's what I think now. And I'm not gonna... I mean I'm not gonna take all those drugs anymore. Because they've left me completely numb. I have felt so fucking numb to everything I have experienced in my life. And for that; I'm here to forgive you. Gideon site up against the headboard."
gideon,Going against your doctor's recommendation; that's a pretty weighty experiment to take on don't you think?
large," This is my life, Dad. This is it. I've spent twenty-six years waiting for something else to start. So no, I don't think it's too much to take on. Because it's everything there is."
gideon,"Perhaps the great tragedy of my life, will be that you both deserved more than I knew how to give?"
large,We deserved nothing more than you. And you deserved nothing more than us. Large puts his hand on the center of his father's bare chest.
sam,What are you doing?
large,I don't want to hurt you.
sam,"No. Why? How can you... how could you... What's going on? What happened? We can figure out the long distance thing. Don't... this is a good thing, Large. Don't... you're gonna be... please don't do this. Shestarts crying."
large,Sam.
large,Is that true?
sam,No.
large,"Look at me. Sam, look at me. This is not over. I'm not putting a period at the end of this thing. I'm putting like... an ellipses on it. Because I'm worried that if i don't go figure myself out, if I don't go land on my feet and be okay on my own, I'm gonna fuck this up. And I don't want to do that . This matters too much to me."
female voice,Gideon? A SCREAM and a BANG from the FEMALE VOICE in the other room! GIDEON'S FACE as it whips up into frame from his task on the floor.
gideon,I need an ambulance.
sam,What are you doing?
large,Remember that idea I had about growing and working stuff out on my own and then finding you when I'd figured myself out?
sam,The ellipses?
large,"Yeah the ellipses. Its dumb. It's an awful idea. And I'm not gonna do it. Because like you said, this is it. This is life. And I'm in love with you, Samantha.  I think that's the only thing I've .ever been really sure of in my whole life. I'm really fucked up right now, but I don't want to waste any more of my life without you in it. Okay?"
sam,Yeah.
large,Because I think I can do this. I know I can. I want to. We have to. Yeah? Tears stream down her face. She smiles her angelic smile.
large,Okay.  What do we do? He looks at her and smiles like we've never seen him smile;
