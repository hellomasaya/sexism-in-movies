Speaker,Dialogue
final script, November 2006
reader note," One thing that will be obvious to viewers, but not to readers, is that the nine principal parts in this film are played by only three actors:  1) Gary, Gavin, Gabriel  2) Sarah, Susan, Sierra  3) Margaret, Melissa, Mary  It'll make more sense in context. Promise."
gary,Hey!   Do you sell crack?
gary,Is this crack?
gary,"Yes, hello. I'm having a medical situation. Yes. Okay. I don't have a belly button.  I do not have a belly button where I should, on my belly. And I'm concerned, because I don't know if that's..."
margaret,La la la la la. Like you've never done worse.
gary,Gary.
margaret,I know.  We need to go out the back.
gary,Are there reporters out front?
margaret,"A few. Not Hugh Grant level. More like Robert Downey, Jr. when he broke into that family's house and slept in the kid's bed like Goldilocks. ""This bed is just right."" I handled episodes two through four for Robert. This sort of thing is my specialty."
gary,What is?
margaret,Famous fuck-ups. Don't worry. Mama's gonna take good care of you.
parole officer,Answer it.
gary,Hello?     Yes. Yes.
parole officer,Use your normal voice.
gary, Nine dogs ran through the field. The koala sits in the tree.
margaret,"It's computer voice recognition. The system can call you any time day or night. If you don't answer within five rings, the police come and haul your ass off."
gary,What if I'm not here?
margaret,"That's why it's called house arrest. You stay inside your house.  He can take direction, I promise."
margaret,"Okay, just so it's said, this house is flammable."
gary,I didn't mean to burn down my house.
margaret,"Yeah, I didn't mean to eat my way into a ten-year shame spiral, but I did, and it's healthier to acknowledge it.  This flammable house belongs to one of Lola's other fabulous clients, who is currently shooting a pilot in Toronto."
gary,Actor?
margaret,"Writer. So for the next six weeks, su casa es su casa. I say, feel free to wear his clothes. He'll probably get a sick thrill of out it. The gays."
gary,He has dogs?
margaret,"They're away at summer camp.    Now, try the bed."
gary,It's fine.
margaret,Comfortable?
gary,Sure.
margaret,"Look, Gary, I know this has been crazy and stressful. I want you to feel safe. And comfortable."
gary,I do.
margaret,"I'm a fan of yours, you know.   Your number-one fan."
margaret,"I'll be coming by twice a day to check up on you. I'm the only person who should be coming by. No buddies, no pals, no heroin dealers..."
gary,I don't do heroin.
margaret,"Yeah, crack is classy. And I'm not buying you porn. There's spray-per- view on cable."
gary,"Good. I really wasn't concerned about my career, my family or my future. I just wanted to jack off."
margaret,Let me see your phone.
gary,C'mon!   All my numbers are in that.
margaret,Dial ten digits at random. Whoever answers will be better than the people on this phone.
gary,I guess.
gary,Is somebody there?   Hello?
margaret,"Poltergeist, and no. Maybe they were rats. L.A. is teaming with rats. They live in the palm trees."
gary,Sure.   Maybe.
margaret,Okay. You know I'm a licensed psychotherapist.
gary,Really?
margaret,"No. I'm a publicist. My job is what other people think of you, not what you think of yourself. So pull your shit together. I am thisclose to getting Christine Walsh to do your piece in Parade."
gary,Parade?   I fucking hate Parade.
margaret,"Everyone hates Parade. But the people who watch ""Crime Lab,"" they love their Marilyn Vos Savant. Give them a woman of indeterminate age who solves riddles and they are in hee-haw heaven."
gary,Okay.
margaret,One heartfelt act of contrition and maybe the showrunner won't kill off your character between seasons.
gary,I'm not crazy.
margaret,Exactly.    Exactly.
woman's voice,Sorry!   Really sorry.
sarah,"I'm working on my putting, if you can believe it."
gary,Not really.
sarah,"Okay. Maybe I was just looking for a way to meet my infamous neighbor. You see, I'm under house arrest, too."
gary,What did you do?
sarah,I had sex with my husband.
gary,That's awful.
sarah,"Nine months later, I had Jaden. That's her over there."
gary,She's cute.
sarah,She's sleeping for another...  ...seventeen minutes. She keeps to a schedule.
gary,She sounds really boring.
sarah, She is.
gary,You're rich. Shouldn't you have a nanny from Ecuador?
sarah,I'm Canadian.
gary, Ohhh...
sarah,"I can't work in the U.S. Plus, I want to maintain this air of moral superiority by doing everything myself."
gary,Very Canadian.
sarah,Thanks.
gary,I'm pretty sure I'll be here.
sarah,It's a date.
gary,Is it?
sarah,"Oh.   I'm Sarah, by the way."
gary,Gary.
sarah,Yeah.    I know.
sarah,The best of all possible worlds.
gary, Okay.
sarah, Are you actually reading it?
gary,I thought I was.
sarah,Sorry I bailed. Jaden had a fever.
gary,Ah!   How boring of her.
sarah,Housewarming gift.
gary,Demon liquor.
sarah,"The best part is, I can drink it. I pumped before I came."
gary,So did I.
gary,"... so it's kind of hard to prove that I only meant to burn my ex- girlfriend's stuff, and not the entire house."
sarah,Yeah.   Fire's tricky that way.
gary,How about you? Any history of arson?
sarah,Strangely enough...
gary,I knew it!     I could see that little spark.
sarah,It wasn't arson.    Probably.
gary,Oh shit.
sarah,"I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up in his arms and raced through the burning building, out onto the pavement."
sarah,"Then I fell in love with the most wonderful boy in the world. We would take long walks by the river or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes. We were so very much in love. Then one day he went away and I thought I'd die. But I didn't. And when I didn't, I said to myself, ""Is that all there is to love?"""
sarah,"Is that all there is? Is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep..."
sarah,"I know what you're thinking. If that's the way she feels about it why doesn't she just end it all? I'm in no hurry for that final disappointment. I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you, when that final moment comes and I'm breathing my last breath, I'll be saying to myself..."
sarah's voice,"Is that all there is, is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing. Let's break out the booze and have a ball, If that's all there..."
sarah,I need to...
gary,Just...
sarah,My shoes.     Are here.     Okay.
gary,Don't worry about it.         Just...
sarah,I'm going.     Bye.
gary,Goodnight.
voice,The cat says meow! The pig says oink!
gary,Hello.
gary,Jesus!   You scared the shit out of...
noelle, You're hurt. GARY I don't speak that.   Sorry.   I don't...
noelle," Mom is at the car. Where you left her. Again, Gary has no idea what she's saying."
margaret,"Think of it like an electronic leash. Basically, if you ever go more than 100 feet from the base station..."
gary,...the cops come and throw my ass in jail.
margaret,No. I kick your ass. Then the cops come and throw your ass in jail.
gary,Do I still have to answer the phone?
margaret,"No, I'll be doing that from now on. I'm moving into the guest room."
gary,I don't need a babysitter.
margaret,"Despite all evidence to the contrary. Don't worry, I'm a cool roomie. Who do you think taught Affleck how to gamble?"
gary,"So the guy was like, ""Do you know fencing?"" And I say, of course. That's what it says on my headshot."
margaret,Lies!
gary,"Always.   So he says, ""Foil or epi?"""
margaret,Epe.
gary,"I say, I'm about equal in both."
margaret,Which is true.
gary,"So he tosses me this fucking Conan sword and goes after me. I'm just swinging, trying to stay alive. But I end up cutting his ear."
margaret,You cut his ear off?
gary,Just a little. But I got the job.
margaret,Wait. You were in Pirates of the Caribbean?
gary,"Yes. No. Not the movie, the ride. I was like, ""Gar! Keep both hands inside the boat!"""
margaret,"Goodnight, fuckface."
gary,"Goodnight, you filthy whore."
margaret,It's incredible.
gary,"I know. Whenever I see them, and I always feel like, damn..."
margaret,...I was born at the wrong time.
gary,Exactly.
sarah,Where's the warden?
gary,Groceries.
sarah,Quite the little missus.
gary,How's Jaden?
sarah,Boring. We haven't had nearly the grand old time you two have been having.
gary,You've been watching.
sarah,Well. I don't want to meddle in your affairs.
gary,My affairs?
sarah,Everyone needs affection.    I get it.
gary,I don't.    Are you seriously jealous?
sarah,The opposite. I just want to protect her.
gary,From what?
sarah,From you. Look at you. You date models. Actresses. Tennis players.
gary,Yeah.
sarah,"On a scale of one to ten, you belong with the Nines. We both know you won't settle for less."
margaret,"What are ""the Nines?"""
gary,What?
margaret,"""Look for the Nines."""
gary,It's not mine.
margaret,It's your handwriting.
gary,I didn't write it.
margaret,Okay.
gary, What?
margaret,Nothing.
gary,"Seriously, what?"
margaret,Nothing. I thought you were...forget it. Done.    Sorry.
margaret,Yhello? Hi. What?!  I have to take this.
margaret,I know who you are.
sarah,Really.
margaret,I know what you are. And if you come near him again...
sarah,You'll what?
margaret,Margaret.
sarah,"I like that. ""Margaret.""   Classic."
margaret,Why can't you just leave him alone?
sarah,"Alone? He's an actor. If nobody's watching him, he doesn't really exist. "
33.,"SARAH  He's going to figure it out eventually. And when he does, who do you think he's gonna blame?"
margaret,"Goodnight, ratface."
gary,Goodnight.
sarah,Hey neighbor.
gary,Hi.
sarah,Sorry for the psychotic episode. I'll blame it on hormones.
gary,Okay.
sarah,Are you alright? You look a little Beautiful Mind-ish.
gary,How many times should the number nine come up? Probablistically?
sarah,Probablistically?
gary, You know what I mean.
sarah,One time out of ten.
gary,How about every time?
sarah,Some of these are prices. There's going to be a lot of nines when...
gary,There is something wrong with the world.
sarah,You have an eyelash on your... here...
margaret,Everything okay?
gary,Peachy.
margaret,Peachy's good. I like peaches.
gary,Sure.
sarah,You have to trust me.
margaret,You okay?
gary,No.
margaret,Oh.
gary,Tell me about the Nines.
margaret,The Nines?
gary,The Nines.
margaret,Sort of hard to start there...
gary,"Try. And don't tell me I'm imagining it. They're showing up everywhere, and I want to know why."
margaret,Best guess? They're your subconscious trying to remind you who you are.
gary,I'm a Nine?
margaret,Yes. It doesn't make a lot of sense of out context.  Coffee?
gary,Why don't you drink coffee?   You're always drinking tea.
margaret,Happy?
gary,Talking.
margaret,On the phone. Usually.
gary,I never met you before I came here.
margaret,"You, Gary, never met me. But you're not always...  I can understand why you're a little confused."
gary,No.   I'm a lot confused.
margaret,Theories?
gary,This is all a dream.
margaret,No.
gary,I'm in a coma.
margaret, No.
gary,"Then I'm dead. This is Hell, or Purgatorium or something."
margaret,"Okay, a purgatorium is where Romans vomited. But no. This is as real as anything can be."
gary, What does that mean?
margaret,Everything is what it is. But you're not who you think you are.
margaret,You don't know what you're doing.
gary,What happens if I cross this line?
margaret,I don't know. But it's not good.
gary,Oh shit.
cut to:," 201                                                                  201 ANIMATED TITLES  We RUSH IN on a television set, which spins around revealing a blinding constellation of pixels.  MELISSA  Previously, on ""Behind the Screen.""  CUT TO:"
gavin,"""Knowing"" is a one-hour drama about a woman whose husband disappears. She starts to believe that her daughter is the key to a dark conspiracy."
gavin,"Basically, it's like ""Rosemary's Toddler."""
gavin,We sold it in the room.
gavin,Just tell me Roger liked the script.
susan,You're shooting a pilot.
melissa,I love it.     I'll do it.
melissa,Gavin and I have been friends for forever.
gavin,It's really hard to think about leaving for six weeks.
gavin,Action!
gavin,Puggies!
susan,I just don't know if you need the cold open. People want to get right to the story.
gavin,I invited Susan to see a rough cut because I trust her taste.
susan,Could we be more clear why Mary is so freaked out at that moment?
gavin,Wow. I thought it was pretty obvious. And dramatic.
susan,I know. But that's Roger's big thing this season. Never let the audience be confused.
gavin,So we're trying to squeeze in a wild line over this shot of Noelle.
melissa,What's the line?
gavin, How could you...
melissa,Howkajew?
gavin,Yeah.
melissa,"Howkajew. It sounds like kosher drug paraphernalia. Like, come on Shmuley! Have a toke on the Howkajew."
gavin,I know. It's just for the test screening.
melissa,They really think people won't get it?
gavin,The dumb people might not.
melissa,I didn't think we were making the show for dumb people.
gavin,That's how I like ya.
gavin,That guy's looking at me.
susan,He can't see you.
moderator,How about you? Did you feel it was...
agitated man,It's not real.
moderator,And what do you mean by that?
agitated man,"The show's not real. Why can't you see that? Jesus! Are you fucking blind?  You think you're above it all, don't you? You are trapped here with the rest of them, brother."
gavin,"The guy was crazy. Obviously. The show is kinda twisted, and it just flipped something in him."
gavin,"Oblivio accebit. It's Latin. ""Oblivion approaches."""
gavin,"Other than the world is coming to an end? ""Oblivio"" also means forgetting, forgetfulness.  I think that's what I'm going to do. Forget it."
susan,Did you have a chance to look at the cards yet?
gavin,From the screening?
melissa,Pardon me.      Daddy needs his drink.
melissa, I still love you most.
susan, People write stuff on the cards they won't say in a focus group. They get more specific.
50.,SUSAN  Forget about anyone who scores you in the Twos and Threes. They'll never like your show.
gavin,The Nines.
susan,They're the one who think your show is almost the best thing they've ever seen. They get your vision. They just want it to be even better.
melissa,Round two is starting without you!
susan,So you'll look at the cards?
gavin,Absolutely.
susan,"Sometimes the numbers point things out that you don't want to admit to yourself. In this case, Melissa."
gavin,"She doesn't have a ton to do in the pilot. There's so much to set up, you don't get a lot of Melissa- time."
susan,True. That's one of the challenges with a premise pilot.
gavin,But the network still likes the show?
susan,Of course. Roger is your biggest cheerleader.
gavin,How about above Roger?
susan,Roger calls the shots.
gavin,After he consults with the Higher Powers.
susan,True.
gavin,Do they like the show?
susan,They haven't seen it. They're watching all the pilots on Friday.
gavin,Why are you focusing on Melissa?
susan,Because she's the biggest concern.
gavin,She's also the biggest star in the show.
susan,"No, you're the biggest star. Roger made a huge deal with you, and he went along with casting Melissa when that wasn't his instinct."
gavin,"Well, hooray for Roger. I don't understand what you want me to do."
susan,Meet with someone.
gavin,Who?
susan,Dahlia Salem.
gavin,Yes. And you put her in Gatin's pilot.
susan,It's dead. It's dying. But the network loves Dahlia. So if she could jump over to your show...
gavin,Replace Melissa and reshoot the pilot.
susan,Roger would pay for it.
gavin,So is this even about Melissa?
susan,It's about getting your show on the air. That's all that matters in the end.
gavin,"I see why the network loves her. It's just, I wrote the part for Melissa. She's one of my best friends. And in my head, I only see Melissa for the role.  Could Dahlia do it? Absolutely. It could work. I just don't know if I want it to work."
gavin,"When I get stressed out, I play videogames. It's my therapy. I can't have them on my own computer, because then I'd never write. So I come down to Koreatown. "
54.,"GAVIN  Videogames are better than real life. When you get stuck, you can always hit `reset.' Life needs a reset button."
gavin,"If we're really going to replace Melissa, I want to hear it from Roger."
susan,Roger's on a flight to London. But I talked with him before he left. He said yes on Dahlia.
gavin,What does that mean?
susan,It means yes.
gavin,"Yes, replace Melissa?"
susan,"He wants your show on the air, starring Dahlia. I just got off the phone with her agents. They love it. She loves you."
gavin,What about Melissa?
susan,You want me to call her agents?
gavin,God no.    I'll tell her.
melissa,"As long as he needs me, I know where I must be..."
gavin,I think my house is haunted.
melissa,Your house is really old.
gavin,"1926. Ever since I got back, I feel like there's someone else there. And then last night, I thought I heard something. A woman singing."
melissa,Shit.   Like a ghost?
gavin,I guess. And then I saw something. I ran into someone.
melissa,The woman?
gavin,It was a man. I think it was me.
melissa,Your house is haunted by yourself?
gavin,Yeah.
melissa,"Gavin, are you alright?"
gavin,No.    No.
melissa,Oh my God.
gavin,"And I'm letting them, because I really want the show on the air. I have all these characters inside my head, and they want to live. I'm the only way they can. This is the only way they can. I have five seasons mapped out, and though it sucks, either you go away, or the show goes. I had to make a decision, and that's the decision I made. I'm sorry."
melissa,So it's done. Finished.   Decided.
gavin,Yes.
melissa,I understand. It's not your fault. You're morally incapable of doing the right thing.
gavin,I don't want to do this on camera.
melissa,"No, because you can't control it. Your little puppets are off their strings, running around. Saying things you didn't write. Reality terrifies you."
gavin,Reality.
melissa,Yes.
gavin,"The reality is, you would not be here without me. I gave you your first few roles. And your career is a result of that."
melissa,"God, thank you. Thank you for finally playing that card. I always knew you were holding onto it, the ""I invented Melissa McCarthy card."" Congratulations, you win. The game is over."
susan,Upfronts is the week each year when the networks present their fall schedule to advertisers.
gavin,"Sort of like, ""Here's our new shit. Like it?""  Upfronts is a complete oxymoron, because no one is remotely honest."
susan,"The schedule is a secret until it's announced, so everything is still in play."
gavin,But hey!   At least you're in New York!
gavin,It's surreal being here. None of this is how I planned it.
woman's voice,God.    Hi.    Gavin.
dahlia,You're doing your...show.
gavin,Get on. Come join reality television.
dahlia,Just now. This whole last 24 hours has been surreal.
gavin,I just said surreal.
dahlia,You're good? I wanted to call you.
gavin,Please.   Call anytime.   I don't sleep.
dahlia,I just felt weird about what happened.
gavin,Did something happen?
gavin,"So I just bumped into Dahlia Salem, star of my show..."
gatins,"Look,   I'm sorry. But I'm kind of not.    I want my show on the air. And I   think it was shitty for you to go   after Dahlia behind my back."
gavin,I heard your show was gone.
gatins,"I ""heard"" you fired Melissa McCarthy without having a backup. Why would they pick up your show when you don't have a star?"
gavin,The network wanted Dahlia.
gatins,"Yeah, in my show. We tested right before you. Our numbers were through the roof."
gavin,Really.
gatins,Really.   Who's your exec?
gavin,Susan Howard.
gatins,She would know. She was there. Ask her.
susan," I'm   at the UTA party. Yeah. Did you   hear about Ricky's assistant? She   literally shat herself. No, I saw   it."
gavin,I will break your fucking finger.
susan, I'll call you back.
gavin,Bullshit.
susan,They're only picking up two dramas.
gavin,"The rest is, what, reality?"
susan,You can go mid-season.
gavin,You can go to Hell.
susan,Wow.
gavin,Didn't you?
susan,"G., I'm on your side. Trust me, I'm the only one who is trying to protect you."
gavin,All I want to know is why.
susan,You want a motive?
gavin,Yes.
susan,"This isn't ""Crime Lab.""   No one got murdered."
gavin,My show did. So tell me why.
susan,I had to get you away from her. She was holding you back.
gavin,Melissa.
susan,"You had to give her up.  C'mon, G. If she really mattered, you couldn't have betrayed her so easily."
gavin,I didn't.
susan,"What, you're the victim? The big Creator can't stand up to one little d-girl? It was your choice. I didn't make you do anything. I mean, do you have any principles? Do you believe in anything but your own ego?"
gavin,Fuck you.
susan,Your dialogue used to be sharper. Maybe Gatins could do a polish.
gavin,"Look, I don't want to do this anymore. My show's not going to happen, so this show is over. "
65.,GAVIN  Done. Gone. I`m not going to be your fucking puppet.
gavin,I'm fine.
octavia,Who were you talking to?
gavin,Oh God.
margaret,I can understand why you're a little confused.
gary,No.   I'm a lot confused.
margaret,Theories?
gary,This is all a dream.
margaret,No.
gary,I'm in a coma.
margaret, No.
gary,"Then I'm dead. This is Hell, or Purgatorium or something."
margaret,"Okay, a purgatorium is where Romans vomited. But no. This is as real as anything can be."
gary, What does that mean?
margaret,Everything is what it is. But you're not who you think you are.
gary,"Okay, then. Who am I?"
margaret,"You're a multi-dimensional being of vast, almost infinite power. You created this world on a whim, and decided to stick around to see how it turned out. You, this body you're in, is just one of your incarnations. Avatars. Call you what you will."
gary,Are you saying I'm God?
margaret,"Technically, no. If God is a ten -- a theoretical ultimate, that-which- no-greater-can-be-imagined -- you're more of a nine."
gary,So what are you?
margaret,Humans are sevens. Monkeys are sixes.
gary,What are the eights?
margaret,"Koalas. They're telepathic.    Plus, they control the weather."
gary,Yeah.
margaret,Okay.
gary,I understand. But I don't believe you.
gabriel,Noelle!   Don't get too far ahead.
mary,No.   You had ice cream at lunch.
gabriel, Apparently frozen yogurt doesn't count.
mary,I'll make note.
mary,Did you hit it?
gabriel,Shouldn't have to.
mary,Shit.
gabriel,Battery is dead. Least the starter is.
mary,How do we...?
gabriel,We call the service.     That's all we can do.
mary,"It's just the little battery that's dead, right? The big one is probably fine."
gabriel,I guess.
mary,We can't jump it from one battery to the other? Cross-over somehow?
gabriel,Who did you marry?      MacGyver?
mary,Are you getting a signal?
gabriel,No.    Do you?
mary,Yes!     One bar.
gabriel,"The minute you try to place a call, the bar goes away."
mary,Keep trying.
gabriel,"Okay, I'll keep trying, Mary.   But it will keep happening."
mary,"Well, what do you want to do?"
gabriel,I don't know.
mary,Maybe if you hold it up higher.
gabriel,The problem is we're boxed in. It's a canyon.
mary,That's at least a mile.
gabriel,I can run that.
mary,So...we stay here?
gabriel,You okay with that?
mary,"I don't think we have a choice, so, yeah. Go."
gabriel,"Daddy's going to get a truck to help us out. You take care of your mom, okay?"
gabriel,Excuse me!     Hi! Hello?
sierra,"No, I don't. There's no service up here."
gabriel," Yeah, I'm finding that out."
sierra,You can usually get a signal up at the ranger station.
gabriel,Okay...
sierra,You follow the road. It's probably... I don't know. You have a car?
gabriel,It's dead.     That's why I need...
sierra,Oh...
gabriel,Yeah.
sierra,I can call somebody when I get to town.
gabriel,I believe you. I do. But you don't know where the car is. And the guy might not come. We can't be up here all night.
sierra,I'm sorry.
gabriel,Don't be sorry. Just help me out here.
sierra,No.   I can't. I'm sorry.
gabriel,Why won't you trust me?
mary,"Okay, but you have to be careful, understand? You have to use Big Girl hands."
gabriel,Were you following me?
sierra,"Once I was sure you weren't following me. I'm sorry, it's just..."
gabriel,You thought I was Ted Bundy.
sierra,Kinda.
gabriel,My name's Gabriel.   Bundy.
sierra,Sierra.
gabriel,Yeah.
sierra,"So, listen. I'm parked that way."
gabriel,Really?
sierra,Yeah.   Make up some karma.
gabriel,Lead the way.
sierra,"Okay, confession.    I kind of recognized you."
gabriel,Really?
sierra,"I wasn't sure, but I think I saw a picture of you in some videogame magazine my boyfriend had. You're, like, the shit."
gabriel,No.
sierra,You're like the Quentin Tarantino of that world. A videogame God.
gabriel,Not really.
sierra,Fine.
gabriel,You seriously recognized me off of one photo?
sierra,I thought you were kinda hot. Considering.
gabriel,Considering..?
sierra,Within the subset of videogame people.
gabriel,Okay.
sierra,I wasn't masturbating to your picture or anything.
gabriel,"Well, I guess I'm flattered."
sierra,You should be. I'm stingy with compliments.
gabriel,So your boyfriend plays videogames?
sierra,"Ex-boyfriend. And yes. Way too many. He used to play Evercrack back in the day, but yours, well, that was like...what's worse than crack?"
gabriel,Super-crack?
sierra,Sure.   He was this orc witch doctor guy.
gabriel,Shaman?
sierra,"Yeah. At one point he was spending like, 40 hours a week gathering ""thunderleaf"" or whatever. "
79.,"SIERRA  Then I was his mule, hauling it around because he ran out of space."
gabriel,You had an account?
sierra,"I was part of your world, and you didn't even know it."
gabriel,Sorry.
sierra,You can make it up to me.
man's voice,"...I have five seasons mapped out, and though it sucks, either you go away, or the show goes. I had to make a decision, and that's the decision I made. I'm sorry."
sierra,So you play a lot of characters at once?
gabriel,A couple.    Most people do.
sierra,You're not most people. You created the world. You know all the secret codes.
gabriel,"What, like `God mode'?"
sierra,That's what you call it?
gabriel,"That's when you have all the powers, and you can't be killed. It's fine when you're designing, but it's really boring to play. A game isn't fun unless there are rules."
sierra,And you make the rules.
gabriel,"Yes I do. I mean, you want to give everyone freedom, but they can't handle it. Half your players are teenage boys, and it's like they're programmed to be destructive. "
81.,GABRIEL  They deliberately crash the world servers. They'd ruin everything just to prove they could.
sierra,Do you think I'm pretty?
gabriel,What?
sierra,Do you think I'm hot?   On a purely physical level.
gabriel,Sure.
sierra,That's a rave.
gabriel,"Well, I don't know why you're asking."
sierra,"My ex-boyfriend, the orc, he says, ""What I like about you is that you're not so hot that I'm afraid of losing you."""
gabriel,So where's the orc now?
sierra,"He's dead. I spiked his water bottle with a massive quantity of GHB. He hallucinated, went into convulsions and died."
gabriel,"Remind me not to piss you off, Sarah."
sierra,Sierra.
gabriel,Sorry.
sierra,And what makes you think you haven't pissed me off already?
mary,"How are you doing, kiddo?"
noelle,He's not coming back.
mary,How could you...
83.,MELISSA  I feel so dirty.
ix,He's sweating a lot.
gabriel,"Am I crazy, or is it getting hotter?"
sierra,"Oh, you're crazy."
gabriel,I have a wife. And a daughter. They're waiting for me.
sierra,Where are they?
gabriel,Back at the car.
sierra,"I mean, which direction?"
gabriel,They're back...
sierra,"Face it, G.: You don't know where they are. You don't know where you are. We've been walking in circles for an hour."
gabriel,Where's your car?
sierra,"There is no car. That was all a...  ""pretense,"" I guess. An excuse to get you alone."
gabriel,What's happening?
sierra,"I'm sorry it had to come this, G. But it'll all be over soon."
gabriel,You're trying to kill me.
sierra,No! No. This isn't a murder. It's an intervention.
susan,I had to get you away from her. She was holding you back. You had to give her up.
gavin,Melissa?
sarah,I can you out of here.    But you have to trust me.
susan,Do you feel like a man?   You're not.
sierra,That's right. Just let it go.       Let it go.
gabriel,Why are you doing this?
sierra,You did it to yourself.   Admitting that is the first step.
octavia,Because you forgot who you were.
agitated man,You forgot this wasn't real.
agitated man,You can't describe it with human words.
octavia,You can't think it with human thoughts.
margaret,"You could destroy the world with a single thought.  Don't, incidentally. Just file that away. But the truth is, you hold all the cards: every church, every candle, every sacrifice -- that's for you. When people pray, they're not praying because they want this thing or that thing. They just don't want to be forgotten."
mary,Noelle?    Noelle!
gabriel,"Maybe if I just cut back, didn't get so involved..."
sierra,"We both know that'll never work. Next week, you'll be back here redesigning the pinecones. You have to quit cold-turkey."
gabriel,I can't.
sierra,You can. But I can't force you to leave. You have to want it.
mary,Noelle!   Noelle!
gabriel,She's here.
mary,Everything okay?
gabriel,Absolutely. Let's go home.
mary,"You need to go, don't you?"
gabriel,No.   I can stay.
mary,"How long? Forever? Every day, you'd know what you were missing."
gabriel,Worst-case scenario? Spontaneous disintegration into a fiery void. Oblivio accebit. The end of everything.
mary,That's all?
gabriel,That probably wouldn't happen. The basic structure of the universe should hold. I guess I'm just worried about the human factor. You guys kill each other a lot.
mary,"In fairness, that's usually in your name. Plus we've gotten much more efficient at it."
gabriel,"I like this world. I like my life, here, with you and Noelle..."
mary,"But it's not real. I'm not really your wife, you're not really my husband. On some level, it's all pretend."
gabriel,"It's not pretend. There's a reason you were there, in every version. You were my sister, my wife, my best friend..."
mary,That's a little creepy.
gabriel,"I wanted you close. In one version, I even told you. I warned you that some day they might come for me, and..."
mary,...You'd have to leave.   How many versions were there?
gabriel,Ninety.   This is the last one.
mary,Wow.
gabriel,I've destroyed billions of people with a thought. Obliterated them. And you'd like to think it's painless...
mary,"Stop. You don't have to explain, or apologize. Everything that is, is because of you. If that's all, that's enough."
gabriel,So.
mary,Guess you don't really need to pack anything.
gabriel,I'm good.
mary,You're great. It's been a pleasure.
gabriel,Likewise.    I love you.
mary,"Love you, too. Ya big lug."
gabriel,You're my favorite.
ben,"Cinnamon, too."
noelle, If I had a horse...
ben,Really.
noelle,And if I had another horse...
ben,Nutmeg?
noelle,"No, Flash."
noelle,Mmmmmmmmmm-Mommy.
noelle,"He's not coming back. But it's gonna be okay. He put the pieces together, it's like..."
ben,Honey? Is it supposed to stick like this?
additional material," The following scene  is the conversation between S and G that plays near the end of Part Three. The plan is to shoot this scene in almost every setup of the film that involves both characters -- be it in Part One, Two or Three.  So we'll be shooting this scene a lot. We'll then be intercutting the best of all these moments to create one sequence."
