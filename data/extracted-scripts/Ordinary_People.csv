dr berger,Who's worried about you?
conrad,"My father, mostly. This is his idea."
dr berger,"What about your mother? Isn't she worried about you, too?"
conrad,"I don't know, listen. You... You're a friend of Dr Crawford, so you're probably all right, but I'll be straight with you, I don't like this already."

dr berger,Really? What's happening? What's going on?
conrad,I just feel... I feel so...
dr berger,What?
conrad,Jumpy. I don't know.
dr berger,"Look. Kiddo... I lied. I do believe in dreams. Only sometimes I want to know what's happening when you're awake. Come on, something's bugging you, making you nervous. You're making me nervous."
conrad,Maybe I need a tranquilizer.
dr berger,Tranquilizer?
conrad,Yeah.
dr berger,I think you came in here looking like something out of The Body Snatchers. It's not my impression that you need a tranquilizer.
conrad,What is this?
dr berger,Clock.

conrad,It's the same thing that happened last year... It's the same damn thing I did last year.
dr berger,Are you the same person you were last year?
conrad,I don't know!
dr berger,That's why you need a tranquilizer?
conrad,You tell me!
dr berger,No. It's up to you!
conrad,"Fifty bucks an hour, can't you decide if I should have a pill or not? I mean, you're a doctor, I'm supposed to feel better! Right?"
dr berger,Not necessarily.
conrad,No. It's still hard.
dr berger,Is anyplace easy?
conrad,The hospital was.

dr berger,It was? Why?
conrad,Because nobody hid anything there.
dr berger,Was there anyone there you could talk to?
conrad,Uh-huh.
dr berger,"I mean, besides Dr. Crawford?"
conrad,Uh-huh.
conrad,Whoa!
karen,Hi!

conrad,It's great to see you.
karen,"Oh, you too. Listen. I am not gonna be able to stay a real long time. I've got a meeting over at school. Drama Club meeting. We're doing ""A Thousand Clowns"" this year. You know it? Anyway. We're going so crazy trying to get it together. I am secretary this year too."
conrad,Don't let me hang you up.
karen,"No. Oh, no, you're not hanging me up! No, I really wanted to see you. I didn't know quite what to expect, though... I mean, you sounded...uh, you sounded sort of funny on the phone."
conrad," No, no, I wasn't. It was just a gray day, that's all. Kind of... But everything's great, I'm back in school, I am on the swim team, and..."
karen,"Oh. You're swimming? Terrific, Conrad! That's... That's really wonderful."
conrad,"We haven't had any meets yet. I could end up on the bench all year, but..."
karen,"Come on, you'll do great. I'll bet your folks are real proud of you."
conrad,"Yeah, yeah."
waiter,What can I get you guys?
conrad,"You're hungry, at all?"
45.,52   CONTINUED:                                                       52
karen,Uh... I just want a coke.
conrad,"Uh...   two cokes, please."
karen,You think we offended him?
conrad,Something I said? Definitely a low self-image day.
karen,So. Uh...
conrad,You really look beautiful.
karen,So do you.
conrad,Do you miss it?
karen,Miss what?
conrad,The hospital.
karen,No.
conrad,You don't miss it? At all? Nothing? Nothing about it?
karen,No.
conrad,You don't miss Leo's corny jokes?
46.,52   CONTINUED:                                                  52
karen,Are you seeing a doctor?
conrad,Yeah. I'm seeing a doctor. Are you?
karen,"Uh... Uh, well, Dr. Crawford gave me a name, and I went for a while. But uh... I dunno.It just didn't work for me, I guess. He just kept telling me all the things I already knew, and , uh... finally, I decided... the only one who can help me is myself. At least, that's what my dad says. I don't mean it's not right for you, Conrad. I mean I think that if it's something you want to do, that's what you should be doing."
conrad,"Well, ya, I don't know how long I'll keep it up. I sorta got shoved into it."
karen,Your hair grew in.
conrad,"Oh, yes. That was such a dumb thing to do."
karen,I like it.
conrad,You do?
karen,Yeah!
conrad,"I don't know, I just... Uh... I miss it sometimes, the hospital. Really do."
karen,Things have to change. You know?
47.,52   CONTINUED:                                                 52
conrad,But that's where we had the laughs.
karen,But that was a hospital. This is the real world.
conrad,"Yeah, yeah, I... you're sure right."
karen,"I really have to go. I'm sorry. I have a meeting over at the school. Drama Club meeting. We're doing ""A Thousand Clowns""."
conrad,"I know, you told me."
karen,Did I?
conrad,Yeah.
karen,I better hurry. Don't wanna be late.
conrad,Thanks for seeing me.
karen,"Conrad? Let's have a great Christmas! Okay? Let's have... a great year. Let's have the best year of our whole lives, OK? We can, you know. This could be the best year ever."
conrad,Yeah... Yeah.
karen,Yeah!

beth,About what?
conrad,Not about anything.
beth,Your hair is starting to grow out. It's looking... looking better.
conrad,"I was thinking about the pigeon... You know the one that used to hang around the garage. How it used to get on top of your car, and he take off when you pulled out of the driveway."
beth,"Oh. Yeah, I remember. I remember how scared I used to get... That whosssshhhhh! Flap, flap, flap, flap!... Every time I started the car."
conrad,"Yeah. That was the closest we ever came to having a pet. You remember Buck asked you, he tried to talk you into... getting a dog. Do you remember that? He said. ""How about it, if it's the size of a little football?"""
beth,"You know. Uh... That animal next door, that Pepper or Pippin, whatever its name is..."
conrad,Pippin. Pippin. Pippin!
beth,He's not a very friendly dog...    I... I don't care what Mr. McGreary says.

conrad, Arf! Arf! Arf!
beth,"Put that on if you're gonna stay out here, okay?"
conrad,Can I help?
beth,"Help what? Oh, you mean with this? No."
conrad,I will.
beth," No, I tell you what you can do though. You can go upstairs to that room of yours and clean out the closet."
conrad,Mom...
beth,Okay? Because it really is a mess.
51.,54   CONTINUED:                                                 54
buck,"Oh anyway, Mary Ann Ramon started to just scream, just cry, right? It was crazy. We got so drunk that we couldn't talk to each other. It was the last day... the last day of school."
beth,"Oh, Bucky!"
beth,No. Stop!
dr berger,What do you expect from her?
conrad,We just don't connect.
dr berger,Why not?
conrad,I don't know. We just don't.

dr berger,What are you thinking?
conrad,That I jack off a lot.
dr berger,So what else is new? Does it help?
conrad,For a minute.
dr berger,What now?
conrad,John Boy.
dr berger,Who?
conrad,"You know, in ""The Waltons"". John Boy?"
dr berger,Yeah. What about him?
conrad,"My father came into my room and he didn't know what to say. This is right after Buck died. And he came over and sat on the bed next to me, put his arm around my shoulder. We just sat there. I remember I was watching his shoe. And thinking... Cos his shoe was turned over on its side. I was thinking: ""He's so uptight, it's gonna crack off."""

dr berger,So much as what?
conrad,"I dunno. I kept thinking that John Boy would've said something...about the way he felt, you know. Something."
dr berger,What would John Boy have said?
conrad,I don't know.
dr berger,Come on.
conrad,Come on what?
dr berger,Don't hold back.
ray hanley,Well. At least she's an improvement. She doesn't crack gum in your face. That's what you get when your partner does the hiring and firing.
calvin,"Oh, I'm sorry. That's my fault. I just can never seem to tell anybody that they're not making it."

calvin,What?
ray hanley,I've been losing you these days.
calvin,"Oh, I'm sorry."
ray hanley,That's okay. That's okay. You off the track?
calvin,Huh?
ray hanley,Come on. I've known you for twenty years. You think I can't tell when something's wrong? How's Connie?
calvin,Connie's all right. He is. He's okay.
ray hanley,"Look, I am sorry, it's none of my business, but I think you worry too much. You've been on the rack about him long enough. You're making it a habit. You've gotta let him go sometime."
calvin,I'm not on the rack about him.
ray hanley,"The thing about it is, in a year he'll be gone. Off to Michigan or Harvard or wherever in the hell he gets it in his head he wants to go. Maybe he'll decide to take a tour of Europe for a year and not even go to school at all. Who knows?"
calvin,"I can't argue with ""Who knows."""
55.,57   CONTINUED:                                                   57
ray hanley,I'm just try giving you the benefit of my experience.
calvin,Thanks.
ray hanley,"With Valerie, it's more than her living away from home... She's gone. Got her own friends, her own life. She breezes in ...for a couple of days on vacations, but... I don't know, maybe girls are different. Or maybe she was too aware of what was happening between Nance and me. But they leave... And all that worrying doesn't amount to a hill of crap. It's just wasted energy."
young conrad,"Give me back my sweater! Come on, it's my sweater!"
young buck,Possession is nine tenths...
calvin,Hang on!
young buck,"Dad, what's possession?"
young conrad,Give it to me!

conductor,Lake Forest is next. Lake Forest.
coach salan,What it is you want? I don't know what else to do for you.
conrad,I'm not asking you for anything.
coach salan,You gotta be kidding me. I don't get it. I excuse you from practice twice a week so you can see some shrink. I work with you every damn night at your convenience. What the hell more am I supposed to do for you?
conrad,Nothing.
coach salan,"Bright kid like you, everything going for you. See, I don't get it. Why do you wanna keep messing up your life?"
conrad,I don't think that ...that quitting swimming will mess up my life. I... I really don't.

lazenby,What happened? You all right?
conrad,Yeah.
lazenby,Salan says you quit the swim team.
conrad,Yeah.
lazenby,Why?
conrad,I don't know. I felt like it was a bore.
lazenby,That's not a real reason!

conrad,Nothing.
lazenby,What happened?

stillman,I told you. The guy's a flake.
dr berger,"So, what did your dad say about it?"
conrad,I haven't told him yet.
dr berger,How come?
conrad,"I don't know. The timing isn't right, you know. He sweats everything so much, he'll just get worried about it."

dr berger,"No. Sorry's out. Come on, something's on your mind."
conrad,What time is it?
dr berger,"No, no, never mind the time. There's time. Look. Remember the contract? Control? Maybe there's some connection between control and uh...  what do we call it? - lack of feeling? Mmm?"
conrad,I said I feel things.
dr berger,When?
conrad,"Ah, God... Come on."
dr berger,When?
conrad,Sometimes. I don't know.

dr berger,Are you mad?
conrad,No!

conrad,Fuck you.

conrad,...is because someone else knew about it first!
calvin,"Just stop it, Connie! ..."
conrad,"No! You tell her to stop it! You never tell her a godamn thing! And I know why she never came to the hospital, she's busy going to goddamn Spain and... goddamn Portugal! Why should she care if I'm hung up by the balls out there?"

conrad,You never came to the hospital!
calvin,"How   do you know she never came? You   know she came but she had the flu   and couldn't come inside, but she   came."
conrad,Yeah! She wouldn't have had any flu if Buck was in the hospital! She would have come if Buck was in the hospital!
beth,Buck never would've been in the hospital!
calvin,That's enough! That is enough!
beth,I won't do it again. I really won't do it.
calvin,What in hell has happened?
beth,"Ah! Oh, god, that's the pattern, isn't it? He walks all over us and then you go up and apologize to him."
calvin,I am not going to apologize...
beth,"Yes of course you are! You always do! You've been apologizing to him ever since he got home from the hospital, only you don't see it!"

calvin,I am not apologizing. I'm trying to goddamn understand him!
beth,Don't talk to me that way. Don't you talk to me the way he talks to you!
calvin,Beth. Let's not fight. Okay? No fighting. Okay? Please. Let's go upstairs.
calvin,I want to talk to you.
conrad,I need to sleep.
calvin,In a minute...
conrad,I didn't mean it. I didn't mean any of it. I am sorry. Please don't be mad.
calvin,I'm not mad ! I'm just trying to figure out what happened down there.
conrad,"I don't know what happened! I am sorry about it all. I am sorry about the whole thing. What I said, I didn't mean it. Just please tell her. Tell her I'm sorry, will you?"
calvin,Why don't you tell her?
conrad,"Oh, God, no, I can't! Don't you see? I can't talk to her!"
77.,76   CONTINUED:                                                   76
calvin,Why not?
conrad,Ha! Because it doesn't change anything. It doesn't change the way she looks at me.
calvin,"She was upset, Conrad. Your mother was hurt because you quit the swim team. I don't understand it myself."
conrad,I don't mean just now. Don't you see? I don't mean just today.
calvin,What then? Explain it to me.
conrad,"Ha! I can't! Everything is German pudding with you , dad. You don't see things!"
calvin,What things?
conrad,That she hates me! Can't you see that?
calvin,"Your mother doesn't hate you, Conrad?"
conrad,"All right, all right. You're right. She doesn't. Please leave me alone, now."
calvin,What about this Dr. Berger? Do you think he's helping you?
conrad,"Don't blame it on Burger, it's not his fault!"

calvin,I'll be downstairs if you need me.
dr berger,"Tuesday you felt great. You bought a Christmas tree, it was all hunky- dory. Okay?"
conrad,You're the doctor.
dr berger,"Don't take refuge in one-liners like ""You're the doctor"". Okay? Because that pisses me off."
conrad,Okay. Okay.
dr berger,"So everything was fine till you had the fight with your mother, then everything was lousy."
conrad,"Yeah, but I don't blame her. I mean, she's got... She's got her reasons. It's impossible after all the shit I've pulled!"
dr berger,"What shit have you pulled? Hey! Remember! I'm talking proportion here. Now, what shit?"
conrad,Lately?
dr berger,"Uh, uh."

conrad,"Hey, come on, if you... Listen, I'm never gonna be forgiven for that. Never! You know, you can't get it out, you know, all the blood in her towels, in her rug. Everything had to be pitched. Even the tiles in the bathroom had to be regrouted. Christ, she fired the godamn maid because she couldn't dust the living room right. If you think I'm gonna forgive... - that she's gonna forgive me..."
dr berger,What?
conrad,I think I just figured something out.
dr berger,What?
conrad,Who it is who can't forgive who...
dr berger,Well a real problem... a real problem has a real solution.
conrad,I've heard this all before.
dr berger,Doesn't make it any less true.
conrad,I'm so tired.
dr berger,"Yeah, well... that's a hell of a secret you've been keeping on yourself."
conrad,So what do I do now?

dr berger,Recognize her limitations.
conrad,"You mean, like she can't love me?"
dr berger,"Oh, kiddo, no. Like she can't love you enough. Like don't blame her for not loving you more than she's able."
conrad,But she loves my father. I know she loved my brother. It's me!
dr berger,"Ha! Now we're back to the rotten kid routine! She can't love you because you're unlovable. Where does that leave your dad? How come he loves you? You're a rottenkid, doesn't he know that?"
conrad,"That's different. He feels responsible. Besides, he loves everybody."
dr berger,"Ho, I get it! The guy's got no taste! He loves you, but he's wrong. Look... maybe she just can't express it the way you'd like her to. Maybe she's just afraid to show you what she feels."
conrad,What do you mean?
dr berger,I mean there's someone besides your mother you've got to forgive.
conrad,You mean me?

conrad,What did I do?
dr berger,We'll talk about it on Thursday.
conrad,Come on!
dr berger,Time's up.
conrad,What do you mean? You're gonna pull the plug... Come on! What did I do?
dr berger,"Come on, Con. You know the rules."
conrad,Rules? What rules? Can't I have a few minutes?
dr berger,You think about it. Just think about it.
conrad,Jesus!

conrad," It's all German pudding with you, dad, you don't see things."
beth, You've been apologizing to him ever since he came home from the hospital. And you just don't see that!
conrad, Tell her to stop it! You never tell her a godamn thing!

conrad, She hates me! Can't you see that?
calvin, I want to be clear.
dr berger, That's good.
calvin,"In the car, I was thinking: ""be clear."". I suppose that's what psychiatry's about. Being precise and clear. And honest, of course. I'll level with you. I'm not a great believer in psychiatry."
dr berger,Okay.
calvin,"I know what happens here is only between you and him, and...I like that, I respect that. And...he's better, I can see that. I am not trying to put you down, I just don't believe in psychiatry as a panacea for everybody."
dr berger,Neither do I.
calvin,I wish I knew what the hell I was doing here.
dr berger,"Well, you said you... thought you could shed some light on some things. What did you mean by that?"
84.,77   CONTINUED:                                                   77
calvin,"I don't know actually, I'm not sure, I think I meant in terms of Conrad. You see, I knew something was wrong even before he tried to... to kill himself. But I thought that... It's clear that he's very smart. He's been an ""A"" student ever since he started school, and naturally I thought that ...intelligent people could work out their own problems."
dr berger,But you still feel responsible?
calvin,"Yeah, sure I do. It's hard not to. It was luck. It was just luck that I happened to be there when he tried it. I could have been at a meeting. We both could've been away. It was luck!"
dr berger,"You think of yourself as a lucky man, then?"
calvin,"No! No. No. I used to. I used to think... that I was a lucky person... before... the ""accident"". Mmm, I guess the whole of life is nothing but an accident, is it? What happens to you. I should do with it."
dr berger,That sounds more like the philosophy of a drifter than a tax attorney.
calvin,"Yeah. Maybe, maybe I am drifting a little. I can see myself, ...and I can see the two of them drifting away from me, and I just stand there watching."
dr berger,What would you want to do about that?
calvin,Something. I gotta do something about it. I don't know what.

dr berger,And you see them as on ...opposite sides of this fence?
calvin,Yeah... No. I don't know. I see her not being able to forgive him.
dr berger,For what?
calvin,"Oh, I don't know exactly. Being too much like her. People always think that she and Buck are... were ...were alike. But it's really she and Conrad. They were the only two that didn't cry at the funeral, you know? It's not easy for me to admit this but, uh... she didn't... His mother doesn't show him a great deal of affection. I'm not trying to put her down in any way at all. She is a wonderful woman, huh..."
dr berger,Did she give Buck much affection to ...Buck?
calvin,"Oh, god, yes, she loved Buck! Bucky got so much... I think what she felt for him was special. You know, he was her first-born. That's not unusual, is it?"
dr berger,And you?
calvin,Me?    I   loved Buck.
dr berger,"What I mean is, your wife's affection."
calvin,For me you mean?
dr berger,Yes.

He didn't talk about that? We don't know what happens here. It doesn't come up. I guess that's what it is. It's private here. Isn't it?"
dr berger,Mm-hmm.   Very private.
calvin,I think I know why I came here. I think I came here to talk about myself.
dr berger,Okay. Why don't we?
beth,Hi!
calvin,This will sound strange.

beth,Why?
calvin,"When I was getting dressed for Buck's funeral, I was..."
beth,"Calvin, what's the matter with you?"
calvin,"Just let me get it off my chest,OK?"
beth,What could getting dressed for Buck's funeral possibly have to do with anything right now?
calvin,"I was wearing a blue shirt. And you said: - Wear a white shirt and the other shoes! It was nothing at the time. But it's always seemed to stay with me. And I, for some reason, been thinking about it and it suddenly occured to me what difference did it make what I wore at Buck's funeral?"
beth,"Ha, ha."
calvin,"Just hear me out, Beth! It won't hurt you to listen!"
beth,I won't listen to that! No one in their right mind would listen to that.

calvin,I just want to talk about something I always remembered.
beth,Why do you want to remind me of it?
calvin,"Because I've always wondered, in some needling way, what it mattered what I wore. I was crazy that day. We were going to our son's funeral. And you were worried about what I wore on my feet. I'm sure it sounds like nothing to you, but it sticks with me and I just wanted to ...tell you about it."
beth,It's all right.
caroll,Beth! Beth! Hi! How are you?

beth,"Ho... He thinks it's a good idea? What does he know about me, about this family? I've never even met him."
calvin,Exactly. That's the point. Wouldn't it be easier if we all talked about it? In the open.
beth,"About what? What are we gonna talk about? Don't try to change me, Calvin. I don't want anymore changes in my life. For God's sake, hasn't enough happened? Let's just hold on to what we've got!"
calvin,"Darling, that is what this is for. Maybe you'll get a surprise."
beth,"I don't want any surprises. I know I'm not perfect. And if I can't go around hugging everybody all the time the way you do, then I'm sorry."
calvin,"I am not asking you to be perfect, you're missing the point."
beth,"I don't want to see any doctors or counselors. I am me. This is my family. And if we have problems, then we will solve those problems in the privacy of our own home, not by running to some kind of specialist everytime something goes wrong..."

jeannine,Why did you do it?

It was like falling into a hole, and it keeps getting bigger and bigger, .and you can't get out, and then, .all of a sudden, it's inside...and you're the hole, and you're trapped, and it's all over.

dr berger,What time is it?
conrad,I don't know!
dr berger,Where are you?
conrad,I...    I   don't know!
dr berger,"All right. Listen to me. Get to the office somehow, and I'll meet you there."
conrad,Okay.
dr berger,"Oh, good. You're here."
conrad,Something happened...
107.,124   CONTINUED:                                                 124
dr berger,"Just wait, just hold on..."
conrad,I need...     I need...
dr berger,Just wait till we get inside...
dr berger,Shit. You'd think they'd assume there'd be an emergency now and then?!
conrad,Something happened!
dr berger,What?
conrad,It's...
dr berger,It's what?
conrad,Oh. God! I need something.
dr berger,What do you need? Tell me!
conrad,It just keeps coming! I can't... I can't make it stop!
dr berger,Don't try.
108.,125   CONTINUED:                                                 125
conrad,I gotta... I gotta... I gotta get off the hook for it. I gotta get off the hook!
dr berger,For what?
conrad,For what I did!
dr berger,What did you do?
conrad,What I did to him!
dr berger,What did you do?
conrad,It's something... It's something... Don't you see? It's gotta be somebody's fault or there's no godamm point!
dr berger,Point? What point? It happened!
conrad,"No, no... Oh, no. I don't mean that. It's that... It's just that... Buck, Bucky, I didn't mean it!"
conrad,"Bucky, I didn't mean it!"
conrad,Bucky!
109.,129   CONTINUED:                                                 129
dr berger,"I know that, it wasn't your fault."
conrad,"But it was: you said. ""Get the sail down!"" ..."
conrad,...and I couldn't!
conrad,"I couldn't! It jammed! And then the halyard, the halyard jammed! I couldn't because the godamn halyard jammed! And then you're sittin' here, you're screwing around..."
conrad,...until it's too late to do anything! And I'm supposed to take care of it!
conrad,And I'm supposed to take care of it!
dr berger,"And that wasn't fair, was it?"
conrad,No! And then you say ...
conrad," ""Hang on!""..."
conrad,"...""Hang on!"", and then you let go!"
conrad,Why'd you let go?
dr berger,Because I got tired!
conrad,"Yeah? Well. Screw you, you jerk!"
dr berger,"It hurts to be mad at him, doesn't it?"
conrad,Yeah. He just wasn't careful. He just wouldn't care. He didn't see how a bad thing might happen.
dr berger,Bad things happen even when people are careful.
conrad,"We were screwing around out there, we should've come in when it started to look bad."
dr berger,"OK, so you made a mistake."
conrad,Why did he let go? Why?
111.,139   CONTINUED:                                                   139
dr berger,Maybe you were stronger. Did it ever occur to you that you might have been stronger?
conrad,"Oh, God, I'd like to quit."
dr berger,Why don't you?
conrad,It's not easy. It's not that easy. God... I loved him.
dr berger,I know.
conrad,Ka-ren. She killed herself! I just found out she's dead.
dr berger,Jesus.
conrad,"And she was fine, she was OK."
dr berger,No. She wasn't.
conrad,She was! She was! She told me! She said she was...
dr berger,What?
conrad,"She was busy, she was feeling good and she..."
112.,139   CONTINUED:                                                 139
dr berger,And what?
conrad,I just wish I'd known...I could've done something.
dr berger,You saw her once and now you' want to take her on too?
conrad,No!
dr berger,No?
conrad,No. I just...
dr berger,What?
conrad,"That isn't it. I... I feel bad about this, I feel really bad about this. And just let me feel bad about this!"
dr berger,Okay. Listen. I feel bad about it too.
conrad,Why do things have to happen to people? It isn't fair.
dr berger,You're right. It isn't fair.
conrad,You just do one wrong thing... and...
dr berger,Um-hmm. And what was the one wrong thing you did?
conrad, Haaa...
dr berger,You know.
conrad, Haaa...
conrad,Haaa...
dr berger,You know.
conrad, Haaa...
conrad,I hung on.     I stayed with the boat.
dr berger,Exactly.
conrad, Haaa...
dr berger,Now. You can live with that. Can't you?
conrad, Haaa...
conrad,I'm scared! I'm scared.
dr berger,"Feelings are scary. And sometimes they're painful. And if you can't feel pain, then you're not gonna feel anything else either. You know what I'm saying?"
conrad,I think so.
dr berger,You're here and you're alive. And don't tell me you don't feel that.
conrad,It doesn't feel good.
dr berger,It is good. Believe me.
conrad,How do you know?
dr berger,Because I'm your friend.
115.,149   CONTINUED:                                                 149
conrad,I don't know what I would've done...if you hadn't been here. You're really my friend?
dr berger,I am. Count on it.
conrad,Hi. I was gonna call but I didn't want to wake anyone.
jeannine,Might have been easier...
conrad,"Listen, I want to say something about the other night. I mean I liked being with you but I didn't like myself."
jeannine,Conrad. I was stupid. That was dumb of me to laugh and it was my fault. I just didn't know what to do. I was embarrassed.
conrad,Really?   You were embarrassed?
jeannine,"Yes. When those boys came in, it was awful and awkward. That's what I do when I get embarrassed. I laugh."
conrad,"But they were all right. They were just up and they were having a good time, and I let them get in the way of what was happening. It was dumb. It was dumb. I've been doing lots of dumb things lately. I just didn't know wether or not you were being straight with me."
116.,150   CONTINUED:                                                 150
jeannine,Yes.
conrad,Yes?
jeannine,Yes.
conrad,Uh...   Are you going to school?
jeannine,"No, not on Sunday."
conrad,No. I haven't.
jeannine,Do you want some breakfast?
conrad,Okay.
jeannine,Mom!
ward,Oh !...
beth,All right. How about that?
calvin,"Boy, oh, boy."
beth,"Oh, I do love that."
calvin,"Oh, these holes sure do love you. Oh boy, oh boy."
beth,"We should spend more time playing golf together, you know that? Maybe our next vacation, strictly golf. Pinehurst, Myrtle Beach..."
calvin,Pinehurst would be nice. I think Connie would like Pinehurst.
beth,Do you do that deliberately or is it just a reflex?
calvin,"Well, you said ""vacation"", so I just assumed you meant him too."
beth,I'm surprised you haven't felt the need to call him since we've been here.
calvin,I was gonna call him tonight.
beth," Hey, could we have a little drink before we head back?"
118.,151   CONTINUED:                                                 151
ward,"Drink, yes. Little, no.  What'd you get? Cal, what'd you get?"
calvin, Let's finish this.
beth,What?
calvin,What you started.
beth,What I started?
calvin,What you started.
beth,Ha! There's no point discussing it.
calvin,I think there is a point.
beth,He controls you even when you are two thousand miles away.
calvin,He isn't the problem.
beth,Isn't he?
calvin,"No, he isn't. Let's talk about what's really bothering you."
beth,"No, no. Let's talk about what's bothering you. Cos' that's what you want, isn't it?"
calvin,"Jesus, what have I done to make you so angry with me?"
119.,151   CONTINUED:                                                 151
beth,"It's not what you've done, it's what you think I've done. You blame me for the whole thing."
calvin,Can't you see anything except in terms of how it affects you?
beth,"No! I can't! And neither can you, and neither can anybody else! Only maybe I'm just a little more honest about it!"
calvin,"Well, stop being so godamn honest, and start being a little generous! And start thinking about him for a while!"
beth,I don't know what he expects from me. I never have known.
calvin,"Well, I'll tell you what he expects!"
beth,"What? He wants me to throw my arms around him everytime he passes an exam? Well, I can't do it! I cannot respond when someone says: ""Here, I just did this great thing. Love me."". I can't!"
calvin,All he wants... All he wants is to know you don't hate him. That's it.
beth,"Hate him? My God! How could I hate him? Mothers don't hate their sons! Is that what he told you? Do you see how you accept what he says with no questions, and you can't do the same thing to me, can you?"
calvin,I just try to keep this family together...
120.,151   CONTINUED:                                                   151
beth, I don't know what everyone wants from me anymore!
audrey,"Beth, nobody wants anything from you."
ward,"Beth, listen. We all just want... Cal, Con, everybody, we just want you to be happy."
beth,Happy?
ward,Yes.
beth,"Ward, you tell me the definition of happy, uh? But first, you better make sure that your kids are good and safe, that no one's fallen off a horse, or been hit by a car, or drowned in that swimming pool you're so proud of! And then you come to me and tell me how to be happy!"
conrad,I think I'm gonna turn in. Dinner was good. Really good.
calvin,It's pretty early. You tired?
121.,153   CONTINUED:                                                 153
conrad,Yeah. It was kind of a rough week.
calvin,I hope your grandmother wasn't too tough on you?
conrad,No. She was fine. I'm glad you're back.
beth,Calvin?
calvin,I don't...
122.,156   CONTINUED:                                                 156
beth,What did you say?
calvin,"You are beautiful. And you are unpredictable. But you're so cautious. You're determined, Beth. But you know something? You're not strong. And I don't know if you're really giving. Beth is looking at him not knowing what this is about."
beth,I feel the way I've always felt about you.
calvin,"We would've been all right, if there hadn't been any ...mess. But you can't handle mess. You need everything neat and ...easy. I don't know. Maybe you can't love anybody. It was so much Buck. And Buck died, it was as if you buried all your love with him, and I don't understand that. I just don't know."
123.,"156   CONTINUED:                                                 156 CALVIN  But whatever it was, I don't know who you are. I don't know what we've been playing at. So I was crying."
conrad,Dad?
calvin,The yard looks smaller without leaves.
conrad,Dad? What happened?
calvin,Your mother's going away for a while.
conrad,Where?   Why?
124.,160   CONTINUED:                                                 160
calvin,Back to Houston. Then I... I don't know.
conrad,Why? What... I know why.   It's me. Isn't it?
calvin,No.
conrad,"Yeah, it is. It's my fault."
calvin,"Don't do that! Don't do that to yourself! It's nobody's fault! Things happen in this world, people don't always have answers for them, you know."
conrad,"No, that's right! You're right! You ought to do that more often."
calvin,"Oh, yeah?"
conrad,"Yeah, yeah, Haul my ass a little, you know. Get after me. The way you used to for him."
calvin,"Oh, he needed it. You didn't. You were always so hard on yourself, I never had the heart."
conrad,"Oh, Dad. Don't."
calvin,"No, it's the truth. I... I never worried about you. I just wasn't listening."
conrad,"Well, I wasn't putting out many signals then. I don't think you could have done anything."
125.,160   CONTINUED:                                                  160
calvin,"No, no, no, I should ...I should've got a handle on it somehow."
conrad,"You know, I used to figure you had a handle for everything. You knew it all."
calvin,"Well, don't admire people too much. They'll disappoint you sometimes."
conrad,I'm not disappointed. I love you.
calvin,I love you too.
