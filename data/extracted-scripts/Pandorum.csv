Speaker,Dialogue
deep space," A darkness like no other, a silence that is unsettling. Sharp pinholes of light show a sea of distant stars across the void of outer space. Our own motion is only realized as an enormous object slowly moves towards us, taking shape. A SPACE SHIP of unimaginable size, a tubular freighter easily ten times larger then any aircraft carrier. At first glance it appears lifeless and adrift, but slowly the small glow of cockpit windows come into view as we move closer. Moonlight cuts across the hull, displaying the name; EDEN.  BOWER "
bower,"Burns are red! Bruises... blue- His voice echoes into the dark, alone in a cavernous room as he pauses, struggling for orientation. He gets to his feet, muscles twitching. His short-cropped hair is... pure white."
bower,"Bower. He opens the locker to see an assortment of personalized belongings, uniform and gear, none of it seeming familiar. He uses a towel to wipe off the layer of sweat and oily substance coating his body, pausing to see an identification tattoo on his forearm that reads: FLT>>005015. He pulls on a black flight suit, emblems and military markings of rank on the chest. He pulls on shoes and a tool belt with a high powered pen-lamp. On the inside of the locker is a emergency manual card with block figures displaying breathing and stretching exercises, labelled; Hyper-Sleep Disorientation Recovery Procedures."
push in,"There is a conflict in his eyes, memories trying to return."
flash cut,"An image FLASHES past, EVALON smiling as BOWER kneels next to her, gripping her hands. BOWER'S gaze remains hollow, frown deepening as he sips the cup and... winces with disgust."
bower,"Faa-uck! Distant THUMPS. He pans the pen-lamp across the ceiling and toward the sounds... PAYTON'S sleep chamber. THUMP, THUMP, THUMP: Muffled and desperate. CRACK! Bower jumps back as someone kicks their way out from inside, the hatch bursting open. Out climbs... PAYTON, a man in his forties, but the rugged physique of a man half his age, lean and agile. His military-style hair cut is also pure white. Gasping for breath, he hits the floor as BOWER tries to help him. PAYTON jerks with shock."
payton,Who are you?
bower,"Bower. Corporal... Bower, sir. I'm the-"
bower,That's right. You're waking from
payton,Corporal?
bower,"Yes, sir. This is disorientation from-"
payton,corporal... Bower.
bower,"Yes. That's right, I'm-"
payton,"Wanna get that fucking light out of my eyes, pal?"
bower,Sorry... sir. PAYTON rubs his face with a frown.
payton,Where... are we?
bower,We're aboard the Elysium. From what I've
bower,I don't... really know. There's no power in the com and I can't even-
payton,Where's the... rest of the crew? It's our shift? Our rotation-
bower,I believe so.
payton,Aren't they suppose to be here... to wake us?
bower,"Sir... I don't know where anyone is. PAYTON takes breaths, trying to regain his senses, glancing around at their darkened surroundings."
payton,"Hit the lights, will ya?"
bower,Ah... we're having some power problems-
payton,Who woke you up?
bower,"Umm, not sure. It had to have been the flight computer. There's no one here...  .except us."
payton,"Cold in here. BOWER grabs him a towel and water container, turning back to see PAYTON doesn't waste any time, stretching his limbs."
bower,There's no power coming off the main grid. Can't fire any of the...  Dynos. Can't even open the doors. PAYTON glances to the other empty sleep-chamber with a frown.
payton,Bower .
bower,Yeah?
payton,"Until I have two coffees you're just gonna have to repeat all this shit, so let's just idle here for a bit."
bower,"Sorry. I just- Just glad to see you awake. i was... a little concerned. I didn't know what to do if- PAYTON gets to his feet, stumbling. BOWER catches him under the arm as they stagger into the wall."
payton,Coffee?
bower,I'm on it.
payton,Good man. BOWER helps him to the locker room as LIGHTS FLICKER past.
bower,"This is you, sir."
payton,How do you know that?
bower,"1 It's... the name on your sleep pod, sir. PAYTON opens the door to see his belongings inside, a photo of WIFE  inside the door. He stares at it with utter confusion. BOWER takes this in, looking to the memory recovery card inside the locker."
payton,"Very reassuring. I guess when you gamma the brain into extended REM, sometimes it can take a while to get it back. PAYTON pulls on his flight uniform and squeezes his feet into his shoes. BOWER notices the identification tattoo on his forearm, partially obscured from view; FLT>>00... . Unlike his own, PAYTON'S tattoo is faded with age."
bower,I've been awake for at least an hour and I still can't remember my... anything.
payton,"Listen, the last time I crawled out of a hyper bunk, it took me... quite a while to get it all back. BOWER holds his frown as PAYTON squeezes his finger into a wedding ring."
bower,"What was... your last flight, sir?"
bower,"Sir? I know this is going to sound strange, but do you even know where we're going? I can remember the training, but... not the mission. Know the procedures, not the... destination."
payton,I figured you'd tell me.
bower,Didn't even know the ship's name until I saw it-on the console. For all I know this was another damn training exercise-
payton,"Trust me, it's not. if this is a simulation... PAYTON notices both of their reflections off the mirrored panel inside the locker... revealing their WHITE HAIR."
bower,None of the activators are working.
payton,"Figures. We can ride two hundred thousand tons of space freighter across the galaxy without a dent in the hood, but can't get one good cup of coffee. PAYTON flips a few switches with no result of power."
bower,"Without the mainframe, we can't connect. I don't know how we'll ever be able to- PAYTON is in his element at the control desk, flipping open an emergency auxiliary-power panel. He snaps open a handle and he forcefully gives it several rotations with a MOAN of whirling magnetos. The hand-crank allows a dim glow of electricity to the light panels."
payton,Payton on the con. Respond? This is Lt. Payton of flight Team...? Shit-
bower,Five.
payton,"Five? How do you know that? BOWER pulls up his sleeve, exposing his tattoo ID. PAYTON nods, ""good thinking."""
bower,Team Four suppose to be here for the shift rotation. Where could they be?
payton,Fucking teamsters. Maybe they couldn't get to us. BOWER eyes the third empty sleep-chamber.
bower,"Where could he have gone? PAYTON gazes off blankly. A RUMBLE of FLICKERING LIGHTS pass and the computer screens slowly fade, going black."
payton,The power systems must be free-floating off blown circuits or something. The over-ride grid won't even lock in.
bower,Whatta ya think?
payton,I think we need to find a deck of cards and call the union. Distant THUMPS are heard overhead and they freeze... watching the ceiling with uncertainty.
bower,Somebody... is up there.
payton,Hmm. Ventilation... maybe. Systems keep re-booting after each surge. That could be anything. THUMPS fade as the ship eerily MOANS and CREAKS.
bower,Jesus. Somebody was trying to get out.
payton,Ironic. I think it was built to protect us.
bower," Well, he got out... some how. A RUMBLE approaches... another SHUDDER that FLICKERS the lights. They watch the ceiling as BOWER counts in his head as it fades."
payton,What?
bower,"It's not circuitry. Reactor timing is off-set in the core. Seems sporadic, but it's not. Each revolution decreasing before starting over from the beginning."
payton,How the hell do you know that?
bower,I dunno. I can't remember my own- but I know everything there is to know about that damn reactor.
payton,The training stuck.
bower,And I know that... Another SHUDDER approaches.
payton,Now if we only had a monkey and a rope. PAYTON climbs down as BOWER rotates his jaw with eagerness.
bower,Our 2nd Lieutenant must have gone this way. Don't you think?
payton,Must have.
bower,It's the only way out.
payton,I think we're better off... waiting here-
bower,For what? If the mainframe is off-line-
payton,We're not going to be able to get to the bridge or even be able to open that door from the other side-
bower,But we can at least find out what's
payton,"Do you remember just how big this ship is, kid? We don't know where that will come out, if at all-"
bower,"But, we can at least try to-"
bower,Can't do... Sir?
payton,"Listen, I have to take a handful of Doxitol just to get in the hyper-bunk."
bower,You're... claustrophobic?
payton,"I can take a lot, that's not one of 'em."
bower,You can guide me... over two-way. PAYTON eyes him over with reluctance.
payton,Just in case...  .there's mail you need to open quickly. BOWER tucks it into a zipper pocket and his photograph falls out. PAYTON watches as he tucks it back in and zips up.
bower,Yeah... I think so.
payton,Must be newlyweds. How can you forget something like that?
bower,What do-you remember? Anything yet?
payton,Some pieces.
bower,And you're the cranky old bastard who made me take the aisle.
payton,"Give it some more time, pal."
bower,"Nothing yet. Christ, not a single vent opening or- Nothing. How about on your end?"
payton,"Power surges keep coming across in longer increments, just like you said."
bower,Hey? BOWER quickly pushes himself forward reaching an intersection in the shaft.
bower,A whole lot of the same... nothing.
bower,"Don't say that. BOWER lowers his head, breathing heavily."
bower," I'll be damned. BOWER collects himself, a tightened jaw of determination."
push in,"As he stares at the emblem, it seems memories are returning, a frown hardening on his face. Distant THUMPS snap him from his trance and he pans his flashlight towards the wall."
bower,I dunno. I dunno if I can- I can't tell if I'm going in circles or- There's nothing to- Can't breath-
payton,"Easy, pal. Breath easy. Listen to me- BOWER squirms, pushing outward against the walls of the shaft with an increasing panic."
bower,I just want... to stand up for God's sakes! Can't breath-
bower,Back!? Are you kidding- I can't turn around! I can't even- Do you know how far I've gone!?
bower,I just want OUT of this FUCKING THING!
payton,Bower? BOWER!? Stop it. Stop it! Just listen to me. Put it out of your head. Stop moving and breath. Listen to
payton,Put your mind somewhere else-
payton,"Well... this may not be the best time to tell you, but I got the door open."
bower,WHAT!? Are you fucking kidding me!?
bower,What's that?
bower,"Dream like that, sounds like you've got some... guilt issues."
bower,Two years?
bower,You said two years. You think we've been asleep for two years?
bower,Why would I-leave her? I can't even remember saying good-bye. Why would I?
payton,"Well, you aren't here on default. This was a select pick. This flight was... different."
payton,We're not just doing speed laps on the belt. This was something... special.
close up,"PAYTON gently rubs his hand across the emblem carved in the steel, brushing away the layer of dust as his finger tips TREMBLE. He pauses with a frown as a SHUDDER approaches..."
bower,Someone's been... BOWER notices the droplets of sweat dripping off his chin are rolling forward across the shaft floor with a frown.
payton,What's wrong?
bower,I'm... I'm at an angle! Shit!
bower,Aaaaeirrrgh!
payton,"Bower!? What happened? Bower!? All he can hear is the muffled, panicked struggle. The RUMBLE of a power surge approaches."
payton,Bower...!? Through the static comes a HOWL of victory.
bower,I'm... out! I'm- PAYTON breathes a heavy sigh of relief.
payton,"Jesus, don't scare me like that! Where are you?"
bower,I'm- I'm inside a boot locker!
bower,"I'm inside a God damn- He shoves outward and the door SNAPS open. He falls out, flips through the air and SLAMS to the floor, an IMPACT on the radio sends..."
payton,Bower...? You alright? BOWER!?
bower,"Make that an overhead compartment. You with me, Payton? I got out. Hear me? He checks the transmitter, crackling with static."
payton,Bower? Do you hear me? Bower...? Nothing but STATIC.
payton,Bower? You there?
nadia,Keine Bewegung!
bower,What-!? He tries to look up and... CRACK! Instant swelling over his eye from a hit. She kicks the envelope opener away.
nadia,"Don't you move MOTHER FUCKER! She quickly pats him down, stealing tools. All he can see is her bare feet, blackened from oil. He frowns to see her toe- nails painted with bright pink polish. NADIA, a torn jump suit, snarled hair hiding her face, skin smeared with oil. A beautiful woman underneath an apocalyptic smear of grunge. Her hair is pure white, high- lighted with smears of oil."
bower,Wait- I'm part of the crew! I'm-
bower,I won't! Please! Just listen- I'm not-
nadia,Take them off!
bower,What!?
nadia,SHOES! I'll gut your ass-
bower,"Alright, alright! Take it easy! He begins to remove his shoes and the radio on his belt suddenly CRACKLES with activity."
bower,"Stop! Stop it! Listen to me! Hold it! she attacks and he frantically throws dishes and chairs to fend her off. She throws the blade, the blunt end deflecting off his forearm."
bower pov,"The only clear view is off an overturned bowl that shows WEASEL'S face, oddly contorted in the rounded reflection. WEASEL is headed directly for BOWER until.., a HISS from HEFLIN calls him back. WEASEL takes one last look before turning back, the torch fades from view, taking us into black. We hear... BOWER'S breath, heightened gasps of fear as he begins to crawl away."
bower,"But, why would she try to kill me!? She was going to slit my throat! And why would they look like that?"
bower,"You should have seen these guys. They were... a very fucked up looking gang. Why the hell would they be-- Payton, they were hunting. BOWER gives himself a shiver as he fearfully checks over his shoulder, eyes shifting with fear."
bower,They sure-as-shit weren't a welcoming party from the Promenade deck! These guys were... looking to do some damage.
bower,We've got to try to contact the bridge.
bower,You're not!? We're not the only ones awake. Team Four wouldn't go back to sleep without waking us for rotation. Maybe they're on the main deck?
payton,If they're in there... why haven't they thrown the security hammer into lock down? Seal and freeze it until the emergency units wake?
bower,"Maybe they can't. With the systems kicking on and off- Maybe they're flying blind, with no control of the LFS? PAYTON eyes the scattered tools across the floor and the ripped open ventilation shaft."
payton,"Either way we can't assume help will be coming. On-board or off. Out here, there is no rescue. There is no turning around. This thing wasn't even built... .to return. He pauses off the involuntary memory relapse, looking to the I computer screens, taking in the thought."
bower,"What are you talking about? PAYTON glances across the control console, nodding with more memories returning."
payton,"This is no regular transport. We're not out collecting data off the belt or hauling cargo... we are the cargo. It was a single launch trajectory for... That's as far as his memory allows, his words trailing off."
bower,.Tanis. Planetary processing and population. We're a settler's vessel.
flash image,"Another place, another time, BOWER leans closer on a bed, watching EVALON sleep. There is a a deep love in his eyes."
payton,What?
bower,We didn't leave them behind. No one did. They're on this flight! Remember the recruitment.
bower,"I've got to find her... before those fucking animals do! I've got to- BOWER ransacks the compartments, tossing aside items."
payton,"Hold it, hold it! Think about this for a"
bower,What's there to think about!? I remember! There was thousands of passengers that weren't part of the development team. Families that-
payton,"No, listen to me! LISTEN! You know how big this ship is and there's no way of knowing exactly where- If you go on some wild goose chase to try to find her-"
payton,"And then we would be no closer to getting out of this situation with even less time to regain control of the ship. BOWER stews, wanting to retort, his mind is racing."
bower,But... how do we- I r PAYTON Where are you?
bower," I dunno. Officer's quarters, somewhere above D-level, I think- I don't-"
payton,I can guide you. Find out where you are. Hatch marker. Over the door. His flashlight finds one of the hatch doors and he climbs up the slanted wall to read the marker.
payton,"Take it. Climbing up the angled furnishings, he searches for any available weapon. He notices a mantel that displays several antique astrological and navigation devices. He spots an antique pistol. He breaks the glass, grabbing the gun, but it crumbles under his grip, falling to pieces. He sighs, but pauses to see... because the furniture is angled, his light spots a hiding spot underneath the desk. He pulls out a silver flask, bone dry. He reaches further, pulling out an unusually shaped weapon, much like a sawed-off shotgun with rounded edges. He snaps open the hand-crank I lever and gives a forceful whirl. A slow MOAN of magnetos causes the weapon's lights to dimly come to life."
angle on,"In the foreground, there is a small fish tank, completely dry with a tiny fish skeleton laying on the bottom."
payton,Back toward the flight decks. Back to me.
payton,What chance have you got out there on your own? We'll figure out a way to breach the command bridge- A power surge sends a SHUDDER and FLICKERING LIGHTS past...
bower,Listen... if you can get me to the reactor bay. I can... reset the reactor's cycle.
payton,Okay. Hold up. I don't want you to go too far down that lane. Just catch your
payton,"I don't know vet. Hold on- BOWER backs to the wall, nervously scanning the corridor, struggling for breath. In the background a SHADOW moves at the end of the corridor."
bower, Eden.
payton,What did you say?
payton,"Of all things to remember, why would you pick that?"
bower,"I'm just thinking, maybe there's something we haven't considered. Eden failed... because of ODS syndrome. The one officer who was suffering from Pandorum. Cabin Fever. Maybe there was something similar with one of the earlier"
payton,"No, no, no. You're talking about- Eden was lost because of a mechanical failure,"
bower,"That was the report... but don't you remember the story of the one flight officer... the real story? They say he went lunar, launched the entire ship, five thousand people killed with the flip of a switch. All from a bad case of cabin fever-?"
payton,"spook story, along with a million others. Eden was mechanical failure, not human error. A. glitch... that was remedied way before we ever-"
bower,And why did they switch the rotation shifts from three years to two? And they eliminated the manual over-ride-
payton,"They did that for obvious reasons, not because of Eden. BOWER pauses... within reach of the window only to realize it was an illusion. A glass compartment door left slightly ajar was reflecting a circular light panel, smeared with oil to give the illusion of craters. His shoulders drop in defeat."
bower,"Well, at least we didn't wake up... floating away in a coffin."
payton," Who says we didn't? BOWER climbs down, peering out into the corridor."
bower,"Something happened to the other team? Maybe there was... Pandorum. BOWER looks to his own hand, cradling the weapon... his FINGERS gently TREMBLING. He makes a fist and shakes his hand, firmly grabbing the weapon."
angle on,"A shadowed FIGURE steps into view, slowly following his path into darkness."
payt on,What's wrong?
bower,Have I done a circle or am I doubling back?
bower,"I've seen this before. This- We follow his flashlight to reveal... a BODY tangled in a wire snare. It appears to be the same dead body he witnessed before, but as he steps closer, it's different. This body has ripped clothing and isn't gutted. It's... SHEPARD, a thin-framed man in a torn crew uniform, tangled in a wire snare wrapped tightly under his arm and around his neck."
bower,"Stop it! Jesus, I'm not gonna- SHUT-UP!"
bower,He's... team six. The unit that's suppose to follow us. He's-
shepard,"Shepard, Thomas L. Team Six. Sector Eight. I think I'm the only one, sir. I knew it. I knew you'd be coming."
bower,Huh?
shepard,Where's the rest of your squad?
bower,Squad? My Lieutenant and I were the-
shepard,Where's the shuttle?
bower,Shuttle? What are you talking about? SHEPARD'S expression drops.
shepard,Aren't you the... retraction team? The
bower,"No, no. Hold on. I'm from this crew. I'm from Team Five. SHEPARD'S face goes pale, eyes going hollow. His demeanor slowly begins to shift."
shepard,You... just woke up?
bower,six... maybe eight hours ago. I had to crawl all the way from the upper deck
shepard,So... you don't have a fucking clue to what's happened? Is that it?
bower,That's what we're trying to figure out! Tell me- what happened!?
i shepard, You know as much as I do.
bower,I don't know anything.
shepard,You'll fit right in. i SHEPARD feels along the pipes until he finds one leaking oil. He vigorously begins to rub the oil onto his body.
bower,What are you doing?
shepard,Get the scent off.
bower,"What ! ? SHEPARD rubs oil across his neck and then goes to check the corner, wrapping a strap around his fist to secure a screwdriver into his hand."
shepard,I can't help you. I'm sorry.
bower,Help.me? Wait a second-
shepard,They go off scent and sound as far as I can tell and they're a lot fucking stronger and faster they you'd think.
bower,They- Who the hell are they!?
shepard,"I can't wait for you. BOWER is bewildered as SHEPARD poised like a sprinter, preparing to run."
bower,"God dammit, WAIT! You're still an officer of this ship and at present time, your CO is ordering you to-"
push in,Fear over comes BOWER.
bower,Payton...?
payton,Bower!? BOWER!? Answer me God Dammit! All that is heard is GARGLED STATIC and PANICKED BREATHING.
bower,They got him! They fucking ripped him apart! They're-
bower,"Aaaargh! Footsteps are heard approaching overhead. On the floor below him are his weapon and flashlight. He stretches for the gun... too far from his reach. The flashlight is ""on"", illuminating the area. He pushes off the wall and reaches for it... fingers touching, but unable to grab it. The GLOW of torches grows in the loading shaft and BOWER pushes off, reaching for the flashlight. Unable to retrieve it, instead he pushes it... into the open loading shaft. It drops all the way to the bottom as..."
angle on,"HUNTERS step up to the edge of the shaft, looking down to see the flashlight fall from sight..."
angle on,"BOWER swings back, grabs the wall and freezes."
angle on,The HUNTERS hear the flashlight HIT the bottom of the shaft and then slowly double back. Torches fading.
angle on,"The silhouettes of the HUNTERS on the ledge, several levels above, inspect the loose cable and after a HISS, they turn back, fading into the shadows. BOWER lays on his back, squirming in the tangled wire as the FIGURE hovers over him, spinning a bladed weapon in his hand."
bower,What...?
tanaka,Japanese- No Subtitles
bower,I don't understand. I- I don't speak- TANAKA jabs a finger into the emblems on BOWER'S uniform.
tanaka,Japanese - No Subtitles
bower,I'm sorry. I don't- Do you... speak English?
tanaka,"Japanese- No Subtitles They share a nod and an awkward silence, BOWER still eyeing the razor sharp weapon in his hand and not wanting to move."
bower,"Thanks. Thanks for... that. TANAKA is dead pan. BOWER flinches as TANAKA picks up the energy gun and then... flips it over, handing it back to him. BOWER cautiously accepts as he climbs to his feet."
tanaka,Japanese- No Subtitles
bower,I'm sorry. I don't...
tanaka,Japanese- No Subtitles
bower,I don't know what you- TANAKA jabs the emblem on his uniform and presents his own
tanaka, Japanese - No Subtitles.
bower,"You're with... agriculture!? Jesus... Listen, I'm not- TANAKA jabs the emblem on BOWER'S chest, taps his tattoo."
bower,"Yes! I know! I'm with the flight crew! But, I don't know what's happened! I"
taanaka,Shee-ip?
bower,"Yes, I'm going to the reactor to try to-"
tanaka,Ree-actoh?
bower,Right. It doesn't really matter- You should stay put. Or go back to your compartment sector- Wait for the security systems to engage. Okay? We're gonna take care of this problem. Dead pan.
bower,"Yeah... well no sympathy here. She left me with a few sore spots too, pal. They both go to work, attempting to wedge the door open with pipes. BOWER looks back to see... NADIA. They back pedal with weapons in hand and NADIA is unaffected, watching them with a frown."
bower,Huh?
nadia,You're... part of the flight crew?
bower,"Yeah. I'm... a corporal, I'm-"
nadia,I didn't think there was any flight crew left. What's happened to us?
bower,That's what I'm trying to figure out. Malfunction of some sort-
nadia,"Gee, you think? Where are you going?"
bower,I'm heading for the reactor bay.
nadia,You just wake up?
bower,"Just joining the program already in progress, yeah. She eyes him over and TANAKA keeps the pipe raised."
nadia,You'll never make it.
bower,Oh yeah? And why is that?
nadia,"You're going the wrong direction. She grimaces and turns, heading back up the corridor. BOWER and TANAKA exchange a look. BOWER chases after her."
bower,Hey? Wait a second- HEY?
nadir,SSSSH! Keep it down-
bower,Hold on. Who are you?
nadia,Nobody.
bower,Wait- Can't join the team without a name.
nadia,Team? Why would I want to join?
bower,Because I need you to show me the way.
nadia,"To the reactor? No thanks. Don't like going that fax down. No one ever comes back. She continues up the corridor and BOWER grabs her arm. She yanks away from his touch, squaring off, weapon in hand."
bower,Hold on. Please- There's not much time left before we lose everything onboard. You understand what I'm trying to-
i nadia,Do you know where this ship is headed?
bower,I'm working on it.
nadia,Can you fly it?
bower,Huh?
nadia,Can you fly it... if you have to?
nadir,"I'll get you as close to it as I can. But, I won't wait for you."
tanaka,Japanese- No Subtitles.
bower,My thoughts exactly.
bolter,"You know where you're going? This doesn't... ""feel"" right."
nadia,Don't know. There's no way to tell time in here. Two... maybe three months.
nadia,Quiet! You wanna get us killed!?
nadia,Longer. I wasn't the first one up.
high angle,"Their flashlight beams continue across the enormous room like two small searchlights. She leads them down into a side shaft, their lights fade from view."
bower,Where are we going? What are we doing-
nadia,i Shush! We're waiting.
bower,Waiting for what-?
nadia,"Quiet! At the far end of the corridor, a faint BLUISH GLOW grows stronger. Shadows are moving, growing closer."
nadia,"Ssssht! The HISS and CACKLES of the HUNTERS grow closer and it seems they're shortly going to be cornered and done for until... A SHUDDER is felt, a FLICKER of LIGHTS approaching. She goes to a control panel, holds down a switch and presses her palm F across a scanner. As the power SURGE passes, the control panel activates, scanning her hand and the steel door activates with a MOAN of"
bower,Who are they? What the hell are those things?
nadia, Never quite felt like sticking around to find out. Running... is always the best option. Believe me.
bower,"They're not- They can't be from this ship. They don't seem... human. Do you think something got on board or maybe I something... He turns to follow her and pauses to see... The BIO-VAULT. A large lab storage compartment that has been ""lived-in"" for a long time. A bed has been created from assorted chair cushions and there is a collection of scavenged items. NADIA adds to the items, dumping the belongings of her bag onto the floor. BOWER is in awe as he approaches an entire wall of glass test tubes, a maze of micro-biological containers, glimmering with condensation."
nadia,"Ecological Development, Embryonic Charter. Livestock and wildlife re- population. The rows of glass tubes are labelled, ranging from mountain goats to octopi, everything a new world would need."
bower,You've been living in here? You're... protecting it?
nadir,"It' seems to be the only living thing left on this ship worth protecting. Regardless of the situation, we still have a mission. We've only lost about thirty percent of the specimens, mostly reptilian class. Never was big into snakes anyway. BOWER doesn't share the attempt at humor, wandering towards a darkened digital screen on the wall, displaying a charted graph of the new planet, TANIS."
bower, Tanis.
nadia, You couldn't remember?
bower,"No, I- I didn't remember just how far away it is... until now. This was a hundred and twenty-three year flight. NADIA begins to gather a few items shoving them into a bag. TANAKKA leans closer to the glass display with fascination, tapping the tubes to see movement inside."
nadia,"It comes only in pieces. Even after a few months. I know everything about this vault and its systems... but I still can't remember where I grew up. Or my brother's name. Only pieces... And the training comes back first. For good reason, I guess. BOWER eyes the darkened computer terminals, portions of the consoles coated in algae."
bower,"How could we have become like this... in only eight years? NADIA ponders the thought, rotating her jaw. She digs into her supplies and tosses him a small block of orange material."
nadia,Dehydrated meatloaf. House special. I save 'em for the weekends. BOWER sniffs it with a sneer and tries to break off a piece... hard as a rock.
bower,How long?
nadia,"I don't know, but it takes more then a couple years to turn coal into fucking diamonds."
bower,You think we've over slept?
nadia,"This ship was built to outlast our children's children... and any engineer could tell ya the warranty is running out. I think we've been asleep longer then you may think. BOWER tosses the orange brick. to TANAKA and he sniffs it with a grin, breaking off a piece. NADIA finishes gathering tools and she slings the bag over her shoulder, ""ready to go""."
bower,Do you have a radio?
nadia, Who the hell is there to call?
bower,I'm not the only flight crew officer awake. We're not in this alone.
payton,"You want in? Come and get it you fu- The screwdriver SNAPS and the panel hits the floor. PAYTON raises the pipe, preparing to fight and... A desperate gasp is heard from inside the shaft."
payton,"Who the hell... are you!? GALLO is tightly wedged inside the shaft, squirming to crawl out, trembling with fear and exhaustion."
gallo,"Help me- I'm part- of the flight crew! I'm- Please- HELP ME! PAYTON oddly hesitates... before lowering the weapon. He digs into the shaft grabbing GALLO'S hand, pulling him out. GALLO collapses onto the floor, crumbling into a fetal position, naked. His hands are locked in claw-like grips, trembling uncontrollably. His gasps are rapid and unsteady."
payton,Easy... Easy. You're all right. PAYTON runs to grab a towel and water. As he turns back he notices GALLO'S hip and legs are sprayed with dried blood. PAYTON kneels over him and GALLO spasms from his touch.
payton,"EASY! I'm here to help you! PAYTON lifts the bottle to his lips, but the water runs down his face, GALLO is frozen in shock."
payton,"What's that? Gallo...? PAYTON frowns, mumbling the name with a hint of recognition."
payton,"Where did you come from, Gallo?"
gallo,The... bridge. Saying the words seems to send him into a terrified trance.
payton,The bridge!? Where are we? What's happened? Can you tell me-
nadia,We can't get through this way.
bower,I'd prefer to stay on foot.
nadia,It's the safest way to travel. And there's only one other way to get through that I know of.
bower,And what is that?
bower,Where are we?
nadia,"Main corridor. Hyper-sleep chamber, Personnel. Keep your light down."
bower,"Jesus... As they venture deeper inside they see numerous sleep- chambers, open hatches and empty. The further they move along the wall, more and more empty pods, too many to count."
nadia,Keep quiet.
bower,Wait a second. My wife-
nadia,Keep moving.
bower,"No, wait. My wife could be in here. BOWER'S focus completely shifts, turning towards the pods, reading name plates."
nadia,What does she do? What's her specialty?
bower,"She's not part of the crew, but spouses were brought with. I remember there were-"
nadia,Then she's not in here. This is development settlers. Engineers. NADIA quickly continues as BOWER tries to keep up.
bower,Do you know where the family members are-
bower,"I don't see what he's looking at, do you?"
nadia,We have to keep moving. We don't want to stay out in the open for too long. Especially in here.
nadia,"We can't stay herel NADIA heads across the main floor and BOWER tries to wave him on, but TANAKA is locked onto something, refusing to waver."
bower,"Let's get out of here! Com'on- The THUMPS grow louder and TANAKA heads into the shadows. BOWER hesitates, turning to follow NADIA through a barricade of dishevelled equipment, leaving TANAKA behind."
bower,We can't just leave him. We have to wait-
nadia,Then you wait... and find your own way.
bower,"We can't split up the team, it's all"
nadia,I told you I'm not going to wait. I'm not gonna get myself killed for-
bower,The guy saved my life twice already. I'm not gonna leave him-
nadia,What do you think he's doing in there!?
bower,How the hell should I know-
nadia,"He's hunting! Bagging the next notch on his belt. You wait for him! Good luck. I NADIA quickly heads deeper into the room and down a darkened and narrowing tunnel. BOWER hesitates with frustration. Having to choose, he turns and chases after NADIA. I They crawl through a maze of machinery and NADIA'S pace is difficult for BOWER to keep up."
bower,"Wait! I'm coming- There's a CRUNCH under his foot. He lowers his light, picking up a small white object. He brings it closer to the light to realize it's... A HUMAN FINGER BONE."
reverse angle,"Behind BOWER is a massive stack of human skeletons and carcasses. They've just crawled into a pit of human remains. They both back away with horror only to see a mountain of carcasses on both sides. The only route is upward and they begin to crawl up the slope on their bellies, over dead remains."
bower,"What is he... doing? BOWER, NADIA and TANAKA quickly realize the effect as shadows begin to move.., the room is filling with HUNTERS, alerted by the tapping of metal."
nadia,Run.
bower,They're... everywhere-
nadia,Run!
bower,What the hell happened to them!? What the hell are those things!?
nadia,"Shut-up! They listen for a long moment... hearing nothing as BOWER looks at his hand, finger tips trembling."
tanaka,Japanese - No subtitles.
bower,I second that. Let's get the fuck out of here. Which way did we come from?
nadia,You want to go back?
bower,"No, I mean... let's just go!"
nadia,We should go back. Find a different path. I don't think we can get through to the reactor bay from-
bower,You said there was no other path.
nadia,I'm ready to explore other options-
bower,Which way did they go-?
nadia,"You really want to discuss it here!? A RUMBLE is heard approaching and they all crouch in unison. It's a power surge that sends FLICKERING LIGHTS across the massive corridor and a BLINKING LIGHT is activated on a nearby sleep-chamber. And then... BANG! The hatch door is KICKED from the inside, white gas erupting from the seam. Our gang quickly crawls toward the shadows, crouching behind equipment to watch as... Another KICK bursts open the hatch and a BIG PASSENGER crawls out, slamming onto the floor with a shiver of agony, gasping for breath, muscles twitching."
nadia,What are you doing-!?
bower,They'll hear him- They'll- We've got to
gallo,What are you doing?
payton,"Just... checking you. GALLO narrows his eyes, pulling the blanket tighter."
gallo,For what?
payton,To make sure you're... alright. You... passed out. You-
gallo,Who the hell are you?
payton,Payton... Lieutenant Payton.
gallo,Lieutenant? You're... a lieutenant?
payton,"That's right. You're Team Four? You're suppose to be... my predecessor. GALLO deepens his frown, glancing around with disorientation."
payton,Where are we? I can't get guidance off this system and I have no idea where-
gallo,I don't know.
payton,"Well, what did you see? How did--"
gallo,"Listen, I'm not a navigator. Stars all look alike. I don't know! How the hell would I know!? Sensing GALLO is about to break down again, PAYTON tries a calmer approach."
payton,"Easy. I just want to make sure... GALLO'S hands are trembling, uncontrollably."
gallo,"I'm fine. PAYTON lowers his stare, hesitating, glancing across the dried blood still splattered across his legs."
payton,Is this your blood... Corporal?
gallo,Some of it is... sir.
payton,"Whose blood is it? GALLOholds his stare, jaw muscles tightening."
gallo,They didn't give me any choice.
payton,Who didn't?
gallo,There was something wrong with them.
payton,i Something was wrong with who?
gallo,It was... Pandorum.  Of the worst sort. They were- I couldn't even- I had to defend myself.
payton,Pandorum. Both of them-?
gallo,You don't believe me?
gallo,What are you doing? What is that?
payton,It's just a sedative. Help you relax- GALLO lifts his fists with a threatening posture.
gallo,"Then you take it... and relax. PAYTON backs off, setting the syringe aside."
payton,Take it easy. We're on the same team here. Alright?
bower,Didn't we come through here already?
nadia,We gotta find a way out.
bower,Out? Why did we come iii-?
nadia,I was trying to get us out of there alive-
bower,I thought you knew where you were going.
nadia,I was trying to save our asses-
bower,"Could've mentioned that after the first mile. If I would have known we'd be doing laps down here- She angrily turns towards him, pipe in her hand."
nadia,I didn't need to help you at all! You and the Hong-Kong Express would still be playing ding-dong-ditch on level eight if it weren't for me! Their heightening confrontation is halted by...
tanaka,HIIISSST! 
bower,"What the hell is that? They climb down the shaft, jumping from filter to filter. At one level they follow the sound into a shaft opening and towards the soft, warm GLOW of YELLOW LIGHT. They reach an open hatch, peering inside to see... Inside an empty storage tank, a comfortable living space has been created; numerous chairs surround a make-shift dinner table made from storage crates with hand-made candles and various food containers. The tank appears empty."
leland,"No, no, no. Back in der' big boy!"
bower,"Get back! BACK! BOWER whirls the magneto lever on the weapon and he raises the barrel towards the hatch, nearly point blank. KA-CRAAAACK! The energy blast from the weapon hits the hatch like a lightening bolt sending a tremendous JOLT through the entire tank. A spark IGNITES the chemical gas and there's a BURST of flammable gas that rolls upward into the catwalks. LELAND is knocked off his feet and he GASPS with shock."
leland,"Whoa... WHOA! What the hell was that!? LELAND is exposed from his hiding place, waving the smoke from his face, bewildered. He's an older man who's lost all vanity over survival. A thin-framed, spidery little man with assorted clothing and a clutter of tools on his belt."
bower,Shut off the gas!
leland,Where did you get that? BOWER angles the barrel towards a vent blowing out the chemical gas and LELAND jumps with fright.
leland,Fancy looking piece. Looking to trade?
leland,"Com'in, com'in! Make yerselves at home. Just throw the coats on the bed and don't pet the rat, it's not mine. Just watching it for a friend. LELAND is excited to have guests as he runs along the catwalks, lighting candles and sealing valves. They watch him with leery suspicion, weapons still in hand."
bower,You... live here?
leland,"Sublet. Got a roomier flat in the bow for the off season, but from here, ya just can't beat the commute. He grins, expecting a laugh, but doesn't get one. LELAND eyes BOWER over, admiring the uniform."
bower,Left? Have you seen any?
leland,"Well, only the captain. informally, mind you."
bower,Captain? Where!?
leland,"Umm, up on B-Deck. Some on C. A few pieces on the promenade and I think his nuts are in the foose-ball game in the rec room."
bower,Why don't you come on down so we can meet properly?
leland,"Oh, no-no. No-can-do. I'm real touchy to the dust bug and who knows where yawl have been. No offense. There's something funky going around. But don't let that spoil the party. Here... LELAND lowers down a bin filled with assorted food items, using a wire to drop it to them. TANAKA sniffs it with suspicion."
bower,Where do you think we are?
nadia,I don't know. Gotta be somewhere below B- deck.
leland,"Why, where you gotta be?"
bower,The reactor bay. Know where it is?
leland,Reactor? Now why would you want to go down there?
leland,"It's tough to properly season with a motor oil base. But if you use your imagination, kinda tastes like..."
bower,How long have you been awake?
leland,"Mmmm. Lemme think. What's today, Tuesday? That would be about, mmm... He counts in his head and across his fingers, carefully calculating, then a grin."
bower,Those things out there. Could it have been something... that crawled out of your lab? Something that-
nadia,No. That's... not possible.
bower,Then something got on board. Some kind of life form. Something that-
nadia,"Or something that was already on board, with us in the hyper-bunks."
bower,What does that mean?
nadir,it could have been the accelerator.
bower,What?
nadia,It's the only theory I can come up with. The synthetic enzyme in our feeding tubes. The accelerator that would help our bodies adjust and adapt to the environmental conditions on Tanis. From what I've seen... these things have adapted... to the ship instead.
bower,"But, why would- You're saying we'll become like them? Why would they be affected like that and we're not-"
nadia,"I don't know. Like I said, it's the only theory I can think of- Unless..."
angle on,"GALLO is looking at the empty sleep chambers while PAYTON remains at the control console, determined not to give up on contacting BOWER."
gallo,Do you know the symptoms of Pandorum?
payton,What?
gallo,Orbital Dysfunctional Syndrome. Pandorum. Ever witnessed the symptoms of first-hand?
payton,I've seen it before. But nothing that-
gallo,"It's not something you can easily detect. Starts with a shiver. An itch. A slow boil... and without being able to get off the ship... there's no shutting off the heat. It'll boil over, no matter what you do. GALLO is slowly pacing the room and PAYTON watches him with uneasiness out of the corner of his eye."
payton,I didn't say that-
gallo,How could they both have had it? The odds are insurmountable.
payton,I wasn't about to question any of your
gallo,"But, we all know Pandorum is greatly affected by any substantial psychological It has an emotional trigger effect."
payton," That's what they say. GALLO slowly rubs his temples, with hesitation."
gallo,How do you think you would react... if you knew the truth?
payton,The truth... about what?
leland,"B0000OM! Oh, how the world cheered to the thunder of it's mightiest creation. Eylisium! The heaven for heroes, to venture further and farther then any of man's machine dared before it. BOWER and NADIA watch intently as TANAKA lazily sips the soup. The first image is off the ship's launch and LELAND hobbles across to the crudely sketched image of three figures, flight officers."
gallo,we were only into our second term. All flight systems nominal. I'd picked up on symptoms with my CO and 2nd Lieutenant. Mild symptoms. Nothing I thought would... become a problem. Until we got the transmission.
payton,"What transmission? GALLO'S eyes are welling up, his lip begins to shiver."
gallo,The final transmission. The last message... from home.
i leland,".until the last cry from home. All of God's creation... ending with mere words of encouragement. Mother Earth's last call. Boop! Leave a message, momma. LELAND presses a switch on a Jerry-rigged piece of equipment, a disc player... speakers crackling with static. A VOICE plays, heavily distorted."
recorder voice,"Hoove arr awl dadz efft ah uz. Bood uck, boogz guezz... ab hoobz deeb. BOWER and NADIA are now completely engrossed in the story, both getting to their feet and walking closer to hear. TANAKA is asleep. LELAND is thrilled by their attention, doing a dance as he plays the recording... over and over."
bower,"What is that... saying? LELAND cranks a power lever, speeding up the play back with eagerness, whispering along. The recording slowly grows less distorted the more he cranks the lever."
recorder voice,"Yoove are all watt efft of uz. Good uck, gog besh... ab Gogz deez. You are all whadz left of uz. Gog besh... and Gogs sbeeb... God blezz... and Gogz speeb... Slowly LELAND'S whisper and the recording come into unison, eerily echoing through the tank."
gallo,"You are that's left of us. Good luck, God bless... and God's speed."
payton,Earth... is gone? GALLO puffs across his hand with twisted amusement.
gallo,"Wiped away. We ran a full sweep off the grid and they were... gone. One day there, the next... nothing."
payton,In one day... it had to be nuclear or-?
gallo,"Whatever it was, they knew it was coming. Wished us well. We're all that's left. PAYTON sits back in shock, shaking his head in disbelief."
payton,Oh my God...
gallo,You can see why I was hesitant... to tell even you. My fellow crew members didn't take the news too well. I wanted to wake the primary crew... but my 2nd Lt was already over the edge.
leland,"Three little Indians, with the burden to bare... no more law and nothing left to care. Three poor souls, destiny undone. Chop, chop, chop... now there's only one. The sketches reveal violence between the three pilots, two of them killed, one remaining alive."
gallo,"They were my commanding officers. Men who had guided me through FT. I looked up to these men. But... it wasn't them anymore. They... were gone. They... tried to... I had no choice. I- With his body beginning to tremble, PAYTON tries to console him, touching his arm. GALLO flinches."
payton,Easy...
leland,One little Indian left... all alone with his doom.
bower,Play that transmission again. I want-
leland,Save yer questions til the end please. We'll have a review. LELAND continues his performance as NADIA leans toward BOWER with concern.
nadia,Could that be real? You think that could-
bower,I dunno. It can't be- It just-
leland,"And now the newest chapter comes to us... three weary travelers, guided by the light. The new brave flyer, woken by the dying machine. He sketches Bower and his journey towards the reactor."
payton,"How could they... how could they have let this happen? PAYTON slides his hands off the keyboard, his finger tips i nearly twitching, an uncontrolled tremble. He tries to hide his hands, sliding them under the console as... GALLO watches him blankly before wandering away to let him sit alone with the horrific realization. PAYTON shakes his head, refusing to accept it."
bower,What are you doing!? What the-
nadia,He was- He was gonna fucking eat me!
leland, Whaw!? I waddn't-
nadia,"He gassed us! He was gonna- All of us! LELAND is appalled, spitting out the breathing tube."
leland,Gas! What gas!? They see he's holding a fork and knife that he quickly tucks behind his back. NP.DIA jabs the weapon and he shrieks.
nadia,What is that?
bower,It's gone... into the final cycle.
nadia,What does that mean?
bower,"it means we have less time then I thought. The last phase... before shutdown. It means we're... done. BOWER is oddly defeated, taking a seat, hanging his head."
nadia,Done!? What do you mean done? What do we do? Hey!?
bower,What difference does it make?
nadia,What are you talking about? You said you could reset the reactor- That we could- That there's a chance to-
bower,"For what? They're gone. Everything is gone. There's no Earth to go back to,"
nadia,We weren't meant to go back! We were meant to go on. And now it's more important then ever! We're the last of-
bower,"And what is left of us? What's left, worth saving? This flight's over. NADIA is angered by his defeat, shoving LELAND aside and squaring off in front of BOWER."
nadia,What about your duty? What about... your wife!? There's still a chance she's-
bower,She's dead.
nadia,You don't know that for sure!
bower,"I know... NADIA grabs him with rage, glaring him in the eye."
bower,You got a radio?
leland,Who the hell are you gonna call-?
payton,BOWER! I'm here! Where are you?
bower,"Storage Tanks, just below B-level. Mid- ship Sector twelve... we think."
i payton,How the hell did you get all the way to Y the other side of-
payton,I hear you. How do we get you in there?
i bower,"I need you to give me a path. PAYTON and GALLO'S silent stare hangs in the air for a moment, the tension between them unclear. PAYTON turns to the console, quickly typing into the keyboard."
bower,"What? TANAKA motions toward the hatchway, shaking his head. He i gestures for them to follow and leads them over debris and through a hole, hidden in the paneling."
leland,What did he say?
bower,"I dunno. But do what he says. They follow TANAKA, crawling through the hole and into..."
bower,"Child! ? That's no child! What the hell is it!? TANAKA lunges, but NADIA blocks his attack. The CHILD HUNTER erupts with a horrific SCREECH, HISSING at them before turning and leaping back up and over the rafters, disappearing into the shadows. They are speechless."
leland,"Not as cute when they're little, are they? TANAKA runs after it. It takes a moment for the rest to react, chasing after."
nadia,My God. They're... breeding.
bower,"What!? What do you mean they? How could they- That's impossible. It appears the CHILD has alerted his group as the BLUISH GLOW of flame can be seen growing stronger in the corridor, the sounds of CACKLES and HISSES approaching."
leland,"Little bastard rang the bell. They all quickly turn back, running down a side corridor and into..."
leland,This isn't going to work. Too many of them. Have to turn back.
nadia,There's no where to turn back to. We can't give up-
leland,Told you this wouldn't fly.
nadia,You didn't tell us anything. You never said that. You said you'd love to come-
bower,Why not?
leland,This is where they live. Reactor is the Keeper's temple. They watch and wait as the shadows move past the doorway with the GLOW of BLUISH TORCHES and vocal CACKLES.
gallo,What are you doing?
payton,I think the direct channels are fried. I'm gonna run a patch so we can get this door open as soon as we're back on-line.
gallo,What's so important on the other side of the door?
payton,"The bridge. As soon as we're up we'll be able to take control of guidance. But only from on the bridge. GALLO continues pacing, throwing glances toward the empty sleep chambers."
gallo,"This ship is not dying. PAYTON refuses to look to GALLO, continuing his work."
payton,He can do it.
gallo,"Twelve hours ago, he didn't know his own name. Now, you think he's ready to re- configure a nuclear reactor?"
payton,He's the only shot we have. Gotta have a little faith.
gallo,"Faith? After what you know now, you can actually say that with a straight face? A little faith? THAP. A droplet of blood hits the floor at GALLO'S feet."
nadia,What are you doing? What is it?
bower,She's not here. She's dead.
nadia,How do you know for sure? She could be-
bower,"She's not on this flight. She wouldn't come with me. She wouldn't marry me.  That's why I came. There was nothing left for me there. She stayed on Earth. Gone... with everyone else. And I left because of her. His gaze begins to gloss over, taking it all in."
nadia,"Well, then... she saved your life. BOWER frowns on the thought, slowly nodding in agreement. His eyes look to the label of the chamber he was led to, the label reads; M. PAYTON. He mumbles to himself, memory returning."
bower,Marianne.
nadia,you... knew her?
bower,I remember her. Payton's wife.
nadia,Who's... Payton?
bower,"I remember her. I remember- His eyes pull focus, coming out of his daze, memories returning with confusion."
nadir,Are you alright?
bower,Com'on.
angle on,M. PP_YTON'S name plate and the dried remains of her apparent death lay in the foreground.
gallo,"He's right about one thing. Once that thing shuts down, we're as good as dead. Nothing on this ship will ever turn on again. Ever. Not the air, not the lights, the heat... not even the pod's escape launch systems. PAYTON refuses to look up from the computer."
gallo,"I'msaying... once it's done. We're done. But, we still have a way out of this... before it's too late."
payton,"What are you suggesting, Corporal?"
gallo,"We can still launch ourselves in the pods. Before the ignition systems are completely dead, sir."
payton,Launching ourselves... into deep space when we don't even know where we are? We wouldn't last more then a few days inside those things. That's suicide-
gallo,A few days is better then what we have left here. I'll take my chances. How long do you think that reactor has been sitting? That thing could melt-down when he tries to fire the core. This ship could be ripped in half-
payton,"Stand down, Corporal. We're not going to abandon anything and we're not going to leave them behind-"
gallo,We can't stay on this ship. You know that as well as I do-
payton,"I said stand down, Corporal! That's an order! GALLO steps up behind PAYTON, his face revealed with a thin stream of blood oozing from under his nose, dripping off his chin, eyes hollow and pale. PAYTON refuses to look at him, continuing to type."
bower,"This is our chance. BOWER leads the way out of the hiding place, heading quickly towards the open hatch where an eerie glow and rumble is felt. They crawl through the hatch and enter into..."
bower,"This is it. We've got to get down there before they come back. BOWER looks for a path downward along the tangled metal of catwalks, coated in algae. LELAND'S fear has instantly surfaced, unable to move."
nadla,"Shut-up! Move! LELAND stays behind, watching as they begin a perilous descent down the walls of the reactor bay wall. Clinging onto the pipes and railings of the catwalks, the odd-colored algae grows more and more dense... a dim glow slowly coming into view from below. With a gap in the catwalk, BOWER leaps across, nearly losing his grip. He looks down to see an odd pattern of white shapes near the bottom. Squinting into the darkness, he's unable to make out what he's looking at and he manages to crawl down further, reaching a gangplank that crosses to the towering reactor. He motions for NADIA and TANAKA to stay put and begins crawling across... towards a darkened control panel."
payton,He's in! That's the reactor's activator panel. We're going to make it out of
gallo,"Trust you? How can I trust someone who isn't even honest with himself. Tell me? PAYTON refuses to acknowledge him, continuing to monitor the control panel. He discreetly slides his hand closer to the pipe weapon as he senses GALLO'S presence behind him."
payton,"Gallo... you have to listen to me... Carefully. You don't haveto- GALLO steps closer behind him, his shadowed outline showing an imposing posture, his voice is forced and unsteady."
gallo,Don't do that. TRAP... TRAP... THAP. Blood drops hit the floor heavily.
payton,"Don't... do what? PAYTON slides his hand further across the console, reaching for the pipe weapon, eyes on the screen."
gallo,Don't talk to me like some child that needs reassurance. Think I don't know the risks? Think I don't know this ship?
payton,"Take it easy- GALLO'S presence is felt behind him, his voice seeming to grow raspier and uneven with breath, anger simmering."
gallo,I know this ship and what she's capable of better then anyone. I know her... and I know what she can and can't do.
payton,Easy...
gallo,And this... she can't do! Why are we even arguing. You know it-
payton,I'm giving you an order...
gallo,"You wanna stay here to die, that's your choice, not mine!"
payton,.to stand-down... Corporal.
payton,Think about what you're doing...
gallo,I'm getting off this ship. My flight's over. OVER! Another panel on the console begins to gently blink as...
payton,This won't work...
gallo,Shut-up. GALLO jabs the syringe gun towards the back of PAYTON'S head while putting one foot inside the pod.
payton,just think about what you're doing-
payton,"It wasn't the crew that was sick, was it?"
gallo,Finish the code...
payton,What did you really do to them...? GALLO slides into the pod and...
payton,For your own good-
payton,"You're not well, Corporal. You just need the proper treatment-"
payton,This isn't your fault-
payton,"Your mind... has turned against itself. GALLO EXPLODES with RAGE... POUNDING on the hatch with a jack- hammer of fists, bones shattering in his own hands. PAYTON ignores his screams, going back to the console and typing I into the keyboard."
nadia,"Hurry! Go! BOWER turns back to the panel, flipping more switches and continuing the process as the reactor begins to HUM as..."
bower,"Com'on... NADIA looks back to see there are still HUNTERS in the reactor bay, ones who didn't join the chase, slowly coming out of the shadows, crawling up the walls."
nadia,Bower...?
bower,I'm going as fast as I can-
payton,I My God... he did it! He did it.
gallo,"Let me out. I can... help. PAYTON ignores him, typing rapidly into the keyboard."
payton,shut-up.
gallo,Where do you think you're going?
gallo,"Think about what you're doing, sir-"
gallo,You don't want to see what's in there-
bower,"Go... GO! GO! Half way up, LELAND looks back to see them coming with HUNTERS close behind. He gives them a look before closing the hatch and latching it."
nadia,You snake bastard- OPEN IT!
angle on,"Inside the door at the far end... PAYTON is at the control console, quickly typing into the keyboard. He hears the E hatch CRACK open and he spins to see GALLO, out of the pod, with a twisted grin, holding the pistol-gripped syringe."
gallo,We both know who needs this shot...
gallo,Who's the one suffering... sir-
gallo,"Corporal... PAYTON slams him against the wall, making him older."
gallo,"Your mind... has turned against itself,"
payton,"I'll FUCKING CARVE YOU UP! Within the struggle, hands grab at weapons, a wrist is twisted... lining up both of their identification tattoos to be identical... FLT>>004>>012>>. The syringe is stabbed into skin. The trigger fires liquid, injecting the chemical into someone's arm as their voices converge, over-lapping at first and becoming one voice..."
angle on,"LELAND runs up the corridor, through the doors and into the room, gasping for breath, pausing to see..."
leland,"We made it! We- I'm with your boy. I was the one helping with- GALLO suddenly SLASHES his throat! LELAND reels back in shock, throttling his own neck in horror, blood gushing. GALLO casually turns back to the console, continuing to type as LELAND tries to cry out, his voice gargled with blood as he staggers, collapsing to the floor. GALLO hits a key and LIGHTS IGNITE, the last door finally engaging. GALLO sigh with relief as the doors slide open revealing a corridor of stairs leading to the bridge. A warm and gentle smile widens on his face."

angle on,"BOWER and NADIA angrily burst through the hatch in the floor, jamming it behind them and run up the corridor. They see the doors sliding shut."
bower,"That's it! GO! Go for it! With HUNTERS hot on their trail... they run full sprint towards the sliding doors. HUNTERS lunge out of side corridors with SCREECHING HISSES as BOWER and NADIA dive through the sliding doors... One HUNTER is crushed by the doors., split nearly in half with a heavy THUD of steel and a MOAN of hydraulics. The HUNTER spasms wildly, kicking and clawing as BOWER and NADIA back pedal into the room. HUNTERS gather at the gap, stabbing weapons between the doors, trying to crawl through with SCREECHES and HISSES of rage."
nadia,Where's... your lieutenant?
bower,"He's not my lieutenant. She frowns off his look and turns to see... LELAND on the floor in a pool of blood, throat slashed, dead. BOWER pulls the gun and heads into the open doorway leading towards the bridge as NADIA follows behind."
bower,Flight log. It'll tell us how long we've I been out... and how far we've gone. BOWER types in a command and the computer begins to scroll through the flight computer's time-code. Starting with the launch date and time the numbers begin to roll faster and faster. BLIP... BLIP... BLIP.
bower,"Who the hell are you? GALLO keeps his gaze towards the windows, emotionless."
gallo,"I was younger then you when I first came on board. Funny, I can't even remember what it was like... before this flight began. It's all I know."
bower,"You were the one... who first received the final transmission. Who refused to go back to sleep. You stayed awake... for all those years. What were you doing... what crimes were you hiding from when you took Payton's bunk? The time-code display rolls faster, years rolling into decades... BLIP, BLIP, BLIP."
bower,Is it true? What have you done to us? Where are we now? GALLO lazily nods towards the windows.
gallo,"Go ahead. Take a peek. You tell me. BOWER hesitates, looking toward the darkened windows. He stays with the weapon on GALLO as NADIA wanders toward the front control console, towards the glass. With the lights fading on the weapon, BOWER gives the lever a quick whirl, motioning the barrel closer."
bower,And that makes it okay? To play God?
gallo,"You think God survived? He's gone... with the rest. There's no one left to judge you, Bower. NADIA approaches the glass, squinting towards the heavily smudged glass. She frowns, trying to wipe away the layer of sludge."
bower,Judgement will come for you. You think you could cover it? Your victims survived. Evolved. That's your creation out there. Your crime. BOWER jabs the gun into his back with force.
gallo,"No world left. No law. No order. Only us. You the law now? You gonna be the one that brings order to what's left? Wanna take a shot at it? I did my best with what I was given. Wanna be King for a day? Give it a whirl, Corporal. I'd like to see how you fare. With the laser sights fading on the weapon, BOWER quickly cranks the power lever, keeping the gun raised- A slow grin spreads across GALLO'S face as he finally looks to him, revealing the thick streams of blood that have dripped from his nose, coating his chin and neck."
bower,Shut-up.
gallo,Imagine... us both. What's left to stop you? I offer you the kingdom and you-
gallo,There's still quite a few sleeping beauties down there... a thousand flavors. You up for a little window shopping?
bower,Shut-up!
gallo, I wanna see it. I'll bet you'd be a
bower,There will be law... in whatever world we create. And you'll pay for what you've done. Believe me. GALLO chuckles with his face pressed to the floor.
gallo,"A real boy scout, is that it, kiddo?"
gallo,"You ready for the new world, corporal? BOWER keeps the gun on him as he goes to the windows. NADIA has a ghostly expression, unable to speak. BOWER leans toward the glass, squinting into the darkness and... SWISH! An object moves past the outside of the glass. He leans closer, squinting to see... a school of ALIEN FISH dart past. The shin is underwater. BOWER staggers in shock, back pedalling as GALLO continues to chuckle."
gallo,"I guess this thing does land itself. Just doesn't float too well. BOWER lunges towards him and GALLO is ready for this one, quickly countering his move and SLAMMING BOWER into the console. He unleashes a vicious BLOW into BOWER'S throat. BOWER collapses, choking for air and GALLO kicks the gun away. He kneels over BOWER, slowly pulling out a blade."
close up,".sending a thin crack across the surface of the glass. She struggles to crank the lever again as GALLO charges, hitting the gun away. He SLAMS her over the console."
angle on,"GALLO grabs her hair to expose her neck and angles the blade upward, forcing her to take a GASP as... BOSSSH! Water explodes through the windows, hitting the room like a hundred fire hoses. GALLO is hit directly and thrown across the room as NADIA and BOWER are engulfed by the blast of black water, sent tumbling."
nadia,NO!? Are you crazy-
bower,"Hold on! Under the roar of the rushing water, hydraulics ignite. Micro-jets FIRE and WHOOSH! The pod launches, shooting down a tunnel until they're HIT with a tremendous JOLT. They are sent spinning into a wild tumble as bubbles and gas erupt across the outer surface. BOWER and NADIA slam into one another as the chamber turns end over end. Its roll seems to slow for a brief moment and BOWER squints toward the porthole to see..."
pov,"They are pulling away from the side of the ship. The exterior hull of the massive space ship slides past at a high rate of speed with a swirl of ocean water and bubbles. BAM! The pod SLAMS into something as SPARKS fly and seals are ruptured as WATER sprays in with a blinding BLAST. The chamber is sent into another violent roll as NADIA and BOWER tumble head over feet, as if caught within a washing machine. The chamber finally steadies as water washes across the control panel, one last burst of sparks knocks out the lights, taking them into BLACK. Only their gasps are heard as they squirm towards the upper corner... only a foot of air remaining. He grabs the mask connected to tubes in the side and pulls the straps over her head."
nadia,I What are you doing!?
bower,1 Put it on!
nadia,No! I can't- Not like this! I'm not going to wake up and drowned-
bower,"Hey...? Hey? She chokes on the air and struggles to orientate herself, looking up to see him gazing down at her, coated with bright sunlight."
wide angle,They sit on the edge of the sleep chamber as it lightly bobs within the ocean waves. They're just off shore from a stretch of mountainous tropical islands with waves crashing against the beaches. The unusual shape of the islands and their geography are nothing like we've ever seen on Earth. Several moons dot the sky and the sun is rising with a brilliant glow on the horizon.

gallo,What is a King... without his Queen. He hits the control panel switch and...
