basquiat,Who am I?
benny,SAMO.
basquiat,Oh yeah..
customer,How's the special today?
gina,It's your stomach.
basquiat,Hey.
gina,It's me. I've never been done in maple syrup. Here's a rag.
basquiat, Gina?
leshko,"Alright. Look at you, staring at this girl, making a mess."
basquiat,How about those pancakes?
leshko,OK! Goodbye!
gina,"Pipe down, Lech. Let him order."
leshko,"You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too."
gina,I just don't think you're being fair.
leshko,I need this?
gina,I need this?
benny, Willie Mays.
leshko, That's right. You go with them. Make babies
benny,Catch you later.
gina,"What's a job, anyway?  What's wrong with you?"
basquiat,I guess you did.
gina,Guess I just got sick of him.
basquiat,Can I walk you home?
gina,I think I could do that alone.
basquiat,"Wait, I'm in a band....We're at the Mudd Club on Halloween. I'll put you on the list."
gina,I hate the Mudd Club.
basquiat,"I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!"
gina, You do! You definitely do.
basquiat,Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
gina,I don't go there. Too many party girls.
basquiat,Party girls? Can I call you?
basquiat,"Here, this is for you. I made this."
gina,Thanks.
basquiat,"Hey, mom."
matilde,Do you like it here?
basquiat,I'd like it better in Hawaii.
basquiat,"""She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!"" Bring me some chicken, baby!"
benny,Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
basquiat,"Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny.  ""Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me."" I did say chicken!"
benny,Thanks.  Your dad called again - something about a job.
basquiat, We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist - she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
benny,G'night... See you in court tomorrow.
bum,"The guy just hit me and I was on the ground!!!! Boom, for real."
voice,Hello?
basquiat, I-Is this the s-s-suicide h-h-hotline?
voice,Yes. My name is Chris. What's yours?
basquiat,Jean Michel.
chris,That's a beautiful name. French?
basquiat,"Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens."
chris,What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
basquiat, Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
chris,What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it - did your girlfriend leave you?
basquiat,No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
chris,You see? You have someone to live for.
basquiat,"No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get."
chris,"What is it you want?    Respect? I have respect for you, just    for making this call. One philosopher said    ""Sadness is a sin against the richness    of the world."" Think about it. Feel it."
basquiat,You don't even know me. I want real respect.
basquiat, Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
basquiat,"Boom, for real."
gina,I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
basquiat,Let's get out of here.
landlady,"Miss Cardinale... Open up for me, please!"
basquiat,Why didn't you say so? Damn! She's asleep!
gina, What're you doing?
landlady,Next Monday.
basquiat,Wanna go get some breakfast?
gina,A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
greg,"Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?"
basquiat,A what?
greg,A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
basquiat,Yeah.
greg,Yeah.
basquiat,You don't have any!!!
greg,"That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!"
rene,"I need to make a call, Mary. You don't mind, do you?"
mary boone,Certainly not. You can use my line.
rene,To Paris. Bernard Picasso -  You know Bernard -
mary boone, Be my guest.
greg,"Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too."
basquiat,I didn't know.
greg,I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop.
mary boone, I can't tell you how happy I am with this show.
basquiat, My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
albert milo, No. Should I have?
basquiat,"I'm a painter, too."
albert milo,Really. Huh. Too bad.
mary boone,"Excuse me, would you please move those tools?"
benny,"Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate."
basquiat,I am... On Gina.  Fuck - I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
benny,Concentrate on the ball. Shoot.
benny,You're shattering all my myths.
basquiat,About what?
benny,Your people.
basquiat,Oh - you mean black people!
benny,For a musician or a painter?
basquiat,Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
benny,Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
basquiat,Come on. I hate this. I'm no good at it.
benny,Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry - fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
basquiat,Who's John Henry?
benny,"Oh man! Folklore guy - worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says ""Fuck that, I'm a MAN"" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike."
basquiat,So then what?
benny,"He drops dead! See? Just do your shit like you do it! Your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff everywhere. It's good. What else do you want?"
basquiat,Like I said - my liquid hijack Marlboros.  Check it out.
benny,What're you doing? You're doing something.
basquiat,He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
benny,"Don't give him anything, man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides, he'll just use you. He's famous for that."
close on, The driver's eyes.  CUT TO:
bruno, I think it's ok.
basquiat,You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
andy warhol,Ignorant art?
basquiat,"Yeah... Like - stupid, ridiculous, crummy art."
andy warhol,Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
basquiat,Ten bucks apiece.
andy warhol,I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
basquiat,You don't even work on your stuff!
bruno,It doesn't matter how much you worked on
basquiat,I can get ten.
andy warhol,"I'll take two. This one and... that one.  Can I borrow some money, Bruno?"
bruno,Here. Do you have change?
basquiat,"You made a good deal. Here, you can have these, too."
basquiat,I'll be right back.
basquiat," Check you later, man."
benny,Hi Gina.
gina,Hi.
gina," Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?"
basquiat,"C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now."
gina,I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear?  How could you do that to me?
basquiat,... I'll buy you some new ones.
basquiat,Do you know what he's saying?
gina,What who's saying?
basquiat,"Manzanita....  ... if one day I die, and    you read this piece of paper, I want you    to know how much I love you. Although I'll    never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your    hair, your hair, your face, your face'"
basquiat, Come on in!
basquiat,"Gina, don't you want any of this? You could use some."
gina,See you later.
gina,Basquiat?
gina,"Jean, what did you do to yourself?"
gina, Don't do this to me.
basquiat,... What's the matter?
gina," Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?"
basquiat,You're back.
gina,It's Monday morning.
basquiat,It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
gina,You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
basquiat,I'm your family.
gina,"Basquiat, what did you take?"
basquiat,Nothing special - just some weed.
gina,"Basquiat, don't lie.  This is smack."
basquiat,You want some?
benny,We got beat.
basquiat,For real?
benny,You gonna carry that around all night?
basquiat,Yeah... I'll paint on it.
rockets,"You did that, didn't you?"
basquiat,I gave it to Maripol. She let me stay here for awhile.
rockets,Do one for me and it's free. How's that?
rene," ""The name of the game is survival, You learn it in jail upon your arrival!"""
rene,"Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?"
rene," Oh my, there goes the neighborhood. Who's house is this, anyway?"
rene,I gotta go pee.
rene, It's fucking amazing. Motherfucker's got to put a crown on it.
rene,Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
rene,Just look at him.
rene,MOTHAFUCKAH!
rene,I know that. Don't let him get away.
rene,"Hey, wait up!!!"
rene,"You heard of Albert Milo. I made    that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't    you read ""Not About Albert Milo?"" I know    who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a    star."
basquiat,Can you put me in the ring with him?
rene,I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They
basquiat,Jean Michel Basquiat.
rene,Sounds famous already.
rene,Oh child... You got no respect. Didn't anyone teach you how to mount paintings?
henry,Ohh... SAMO. I've heard a lot about you. I love your graffiti.
basquiat,I was a kid then.
henry, How much are these?
rene,You or the museum?
henry,It's for me.
rene,Five.
henry,I'll take it.
rene,"That's five thousand dollars.  He's from the Metropolitan Museum of Art so suck my pussy, you star."
basquiat,"You look fucking beautiful, beautiful."
gina,Well thanks!
rene,"This is Jean Michel, whose work I told you about."
annina nosei, Rene hasn't stopped talking about your paintings. Haven't I seen you in my gallery?
basquiat,No.
annina nosei, You haven't been by lately.
rene,I didn't have the subway fare. My Medicare ran out.
basquiat,I don't know.
bruno,You're doing well.
annina nosei,I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
basquiat,"You name it, I paint there."
annina nosei,"Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card."
basquiat,You want a drink?
annina nosei,No thanks.  But I'd like one of these paintings.
gina,Who's that?
rene,You kidding? That's Annina Nosei. Jean's been in her gallery a thousand times.  He's only the biggest art dealer in Europe.
basquiat,I had lunch with him once.
basquiat,Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
gina, I hadn't thought about it.
basquiat," Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee -"
gina,Staten Island would be ok.
basquiat,Do you wanna marry me?
gina,Kind of a family portrait.
basquiat,Think so?
gina,You mean babies with you?
basquiat,What's wrong with me?
gina,You're your own baby.
gina,Who is it?
gina,Who?
annina nosei,Is Jean Michel here?
gina,No.
annina nosei,I'm here to see some work.
gina,Aren't they?
annina nosei,How much for these five?
gina,You should talk to him about this.
annina nosei, Um... Do Rene and Jean have a contract together?
gina,I really think you should talk to him about this.
basquiat,When?
annina nosei,How about right now?
gina, Be ready in a minute!
basquiat,"Honk the horn again, will you please?"
benny,"What's the rush, John Henry?"
basquiat,I ain't John Henry.
benny,Good.
basquiat,"What's your fuckin' problem, anyway?"
benny, I don't really have any problems.
basquiat,Good. What do you have?
benny,What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
basquiat, 'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
benny,"That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell."
basquiat,Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
annina nosei,I've got to find the switch.
annina nosei,Here it is.
rene,"3rd night I called    him 'boy' He sed ""don't call    me 'boy'"" ""Well Then don't call me    'Boss'"" That Was the end for us    and I've Been seeing him for    2 1/2 years. In kangaroo court I    want to be"
rene,Oh man! That's one looks famous already.
basquiat, I forgot about that.
rene,Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts - you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
basquiat,Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
rene,Singing on stage and painting in your spare
basquiat,I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
rene,My point exactly.
basquiat,"Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?"
rene,"You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?"
basquiat,So what?
rene,So shut up and keep painting..
basquiat, What time is it?
basquiat,That one's for you.
rene,Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
basquiat,I can't. After the show.
basquiat,Hey - it's the big A.M..
albert milo,Rene's been telling me about your work.
basquiat,I don't know.
albert milo,When's your show?
basquiat,Not sure. How was yours?
albert milo,"I haven't decided yet.  Rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you."
rene,How about now?
albert milo,See you at your opening. Thanks.
annina nosei,This is Jean Michel Basquiat.  You've seen the SAMO graffiti everywhere. That's his. This is the true voice of the gutter.
cynthia kruger,We've seen the graffiti. I work on Wall Street. And I've heard wonderful things about the paintings. Everybody's talking about you.
basquiat,Yeah.
annina nosei,"Here's a very good example of his recent work that's not spoken for yet.  He's got to work in a basement. He's got so much energy that if he worked in a place with a window, he'd jump right through it. Most of these are reserved already. After this week, this work will not be available."
tom kruger," ... I don't know.... This one's nice, but I don't know if I could live with it. That green is so... institutional."
basquiat,You like it?
cynthia kruger,I'm fascinated by his choice of crossing out words that way.
annina nosei,"Yes, well, they are more meaningful in their absence, no?"
cynthia kruger,"I like this one, but that green..."
basquiat,Y'want me to make it a nice shit brown?
tom kruger,Beg pardon?
basquiat,Hi. This is Gina.
cynthia kruger,They're something like Dubuffet's... That... childlike quality.
tom kruger,I like this one. If it were just another color..
basquiat,"Get a fucking decorator. If you buy one, you'll have to change your whole lives - maybe even sell your kids!  These paintings aren't even done yet!!!"
basquiat,"I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie."
counterman,"You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie."
basquiat,"Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies."
counterman,You only want one Big Mac?
basquiat,Yeah... And make it three apple pies.
big pink,How can I ever thank you?
basquiat, I'd like to squeeze your titties.
big pink,Come on.
basquiat,Wanna Mac?
big pink,"No, I'd like the scarf."
basquiat,Have a Mac.
big pink,I don't eat junk food.
basquiat,"Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?"
big pink,You're a fast mover.
basquiat,No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
gina,Hi.
basquiat,Hi.
gina,What's that?
basquiat,A present I picked up for you.
gina,It's beautiful. Thanks.
basquiat, You look like an angel.
man," Jean, man!!! Let's make a record!"

basquiat,"Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket."
andy warhol,"My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!"
basquiat,"Yeah, I met her already."
mary boone, You should be pleased. It's a great show...I'm having a dinner later at Mr. Chow's for Albert. You should come.

annina nosei,"Jean, your parents are here."

nora,Congratulations.
basquiat,Thanks for coming.
annina nosei, You must be very proud.

tom kruger,The green one.
basquiat,Oh yeah.
cynthia kruger,We got a couch to match.
tom kruger,She's only kidding!
benny,Willie Mays. A Toast.
basquiat,"Not now, ok?"
rockets,"Jean Michel, my man. Nice party. Should we step into my office?"
basquiat,That's alright. I'm cool now.
rockets,A gift! I was just trying to give you a gift!
basquiat,I gotta go.
photographer,"Of the painters, please."
basquiat,He said 'of the painters!' Hey - Albert! Get in the picture!
albert milo,"Hey, Jean, I'd like you to meet my wife....and my parents. Mom, Dad, this is Jean Michel Basquiat."
esther milo," Hello, Jean."
jack milo,"Hi, John... Are your parents here?"
basquiat,Well.  My dad's here with his wife. My mom couldn't make it.
esther milo, No thanks.
bruno, I'm especially interested in that one. I'd like to buy it for myself.
basquiat,I wasn't gonna sell this one.
bruno,You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
basquiat,"Sure, ok.."
bruno,It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
andy warhol,"Bye, Jean."
rene," You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother - when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit."
basquiat,I'll make you another one.
rene,Forget it.
basquiat,Rene -
rene,"SHHHHHH. Later.  ""What is it about art, anyway......"""
driver,I really... admire you.
basquiat,Me? Why?
basquiat,That's great.
driver,Would you check out my studio some time?
basquiat,Sure. I'd be glad to.
driver,Here?
basquiat," What's your name, man?"
driver,"They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge."
basquiat,"Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?"
andy warhol,"Hi, Jean."
bruno,"Jean, everyone loved your show."
jack milo,"Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York."
andy warhol,Saddle River's in New Jersey.
jack milo,"Saddle River, New York!"
andy warhol,It's in New Jersey.
jack milo,New York.
andy warhol,I think it's in New Jersey.
jack milo,It's in New York.
andy warhol,"Oh, I didn't know that."
albert milo, You finish it.
basquiat,Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
rene,"I'd like a glass of your best champagne, please?  This is an enormously important season in New York, and to make a false step could have severe repercussions for years. We are no longer collecting art, we're buying individuals."
andy warhol,"Oh shut up, Rene."
rene,"Everything's over your head, Andy. Even Mr. Chow's menu.  Thanks for not inviting me"
rene,"Isn't he great? Thanks, Jean."
rene,I haven't eaten yet!!!
andy warhol,"Wow... That was a nice drawing, too, Jean. Maybe you should do another one."
annina nosei," It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio."
basquiat,Sure.
basquiat,I hate this. Turn that off.
interviewer,We're running a little late.
basquiat,Decipher?
interviewer,Yes. What do they... stand for?
basquiat,They're just words.
interviewer,"Yes, I understand - but where do you take them from?"
basquiat,Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
interviewer, What are they?
basquiat, It looks good like that.
interviewer,Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
basquiat,You mean like an ape?
interviewer,"Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?"
basquiat,"Oh, that's a ""Leonardo's Greatest Hits"" painting. You like it?"
interviewer,"Yes, but as a black painter -"
basquiat,I use a lot of colors - not only black.
interviewer,What?
basquiat,I'm not black.
interviewer,You're not?
basquiat,Not what?
interviewer,Not black.
basquiat,"No, I'm Haitian-Puerto Rican."
interviewer,"Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?"
basquiat, Yup.
interviewer,Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
basquiat,"We don't hang them at home, y'know - just in the streets.."
interviewer,"I see..  - yes, ""the pickaninny of the art world."""
basquiat, Who said that?
interviewer,"Why, that's from Time Magazine."
basquiat,"No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy."
interviewer,Is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution?
basquiat,Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
interviewer,OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
basquiat,Should there be?
interviewer,Tell me about it. What are you angry about?
basquiat,Mmmm. I don't know. I don't remember.
basquiat," Can I have some caviar, please?"
counterman,"Yeah, it's the best one."
basquiat,I'll take the whole tin.
counterman,It's three thousand dollars!
basquiat,I'll take it.  Just the caviar - I'll get the rest.
andy warhol,"When I was little, my brother and I used to have two ducks as pets. We called them the Rodriguez Brothers."
basquiat,I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
andy warhol,That's good. At least they're interested.
basquiat,"Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors - anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: ""Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"""
andy warhol,Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
basquiat,Yeah - I'd do that... You could teach me.
andy warhol,Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
basquiat,Cool.
andy warhol,"My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well."
basquiat,Let's leave this town and go someplace.
andy warhol,Let's go to    the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's    most famous sculptures all in these giant    plaster replicas. It's really great. It's    in Pittsburg.
basquiat,Ouch..
andy warhol,What's wrong?
basquiat,That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
andy warhol,Do you still love her?
basquiat,Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
andy warhol,"Well, have you asked her to come back?"
basquiat,"Hey George, what's up?"
gina,So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
basquiat,He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
gina,Don't you think he's using you?
basquiat,Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
george,Would you like to see the wine list?
basquiat,"Chateau Latour '64, please."
gina,"So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but - whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published."
basquiat,How is he?
gina,Pretty much the same.
basquiat,Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're -
gina, What's that about?
gina,That is amazing. What year is it?
basquiat,George?
george,"I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat."
basquiat,See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
george,I'm sorry?
basquiat,"Yeah, just put their bill on my tab."
george,Really?
basquiat,Yeah.
george,Very well.
basquiat," Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were -"
gina,"I don't believe it, Jean - they're picking straws."
basquiat,I wish you niggahs could get it togeth- ahhhhhh.
young executive,What's this for?
basquiat,The tip.
gina,"You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't."
basquiat,What's his name?
basquiat, What do you think?
basquiat,It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
albert milo,You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
basquiat,"Why, so you could humiliate me?"
albert milo,"No, I wanted to make a painting of you."
angle on," The birds. We see the statue in the middle of the park, but we have no idea where we are until we see the Mays Dept. Store sign. The birds circle in flocks, never lighting on the trees."
andy warhol,"A little more to the right, Frank. OK... Good. Now up... You got a little more?"
basquiat,What's with the wigs?
andy warhol,I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
basquiat,You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig?
basquiat,Piss painting?
andy warhol,I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
basquiat,How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
andy warhol,I don't like beer.
basquiat,"If you ever want me to shit on 'em, just ask. You could finger paint."
andy warhol,That was my favorite part!
basquiat,We can do better. It needed more white.
andy warhol,"Jean, you make me feel worthless. You're so famous."
basquiat,"I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says ""Warhol?"
andy warhol,"Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you."
basquiat,"People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work."
basquiat,"When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now."
andy warhol,If you say so. You sleep until 5:00 p.m. You call at four in the morning. You never show up anywhere on time - if you show up. You're painting out everything I do!
basquiat,That's better.
andy warhol,I can't even see what's good anymore.
basquiat,After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what
andy warhol,That would be a pity because you're a real painter.
frank,Here's the poster for the show.
insert," The screen is filled with the cover of the New York Times Magazine. Jean is featured on the cover, without his dreadlocks."
basquiat,Name?
brunette,Elke.
basquiat,Number?
basquiat,Name?
blonde,Monica.
basquiat,Number?
basquiat,"Yo, Frank."
frank,This is really great. What a nice place.
basquiat,I don't think so.
christine,Would you sign one of those for me?
toxic,"YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee."
rammellzee,"Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?"
toxic,Uh-oh!
rammellzee,I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
basquiat,Boom.
rammellzee,Boom? As in ordnance? Are your letters
toxic," Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT."
rammellzee,"You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man."
toxic,That's ignorant.
basquiat,That ain't ignorant - that's just stupid.  Can I get you a bowl of gumbo?
rammellzee,This interrogation is not over!
woman,Albert Milo? Ugh! He's just a pressmonger. That's all these people do.
rene,His early work? He's only twenty-six!
basquiat,"Hey, Rene."
rene,Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.
andy warhol, What's a suede biscuit?
christine," Hey, what's this? It says right here you're Andy's... ""lapdog""..."
basquiat,Here... Pull over.
basquiat,What's up?
basquiat, That's mine.
kid,"That ain't yours, man. Some asshole named SAMO did this."
basquiat,There you go. Now it's worth more.
basquiat,I'm SAMO... I'm SAMO...
the sea," It is flat, dead, gray.  Ominous and waiting."
basquiat,Paint it out.
shenge,Out?
basquiat,Yeah... Maybe just his arms.
shenge,It's Andy again.
basquiat,Still not here.
shenge,- In this corner?
basquiat, Yeah..
shenge,You want me to put it here?
basquiat,Use your fucking instinct.
shenge,It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
basquiat,"Why don't you try letting her in, Steve - I mean Shenge."
shenge,Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
basquiat,"Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you."
maria," These reminded me of you, the clogs. I found them in Amsterdam."
basquiat,Fine.
maria,You remember Ellen?  What are you working on?
ellen,How much is something like that?
maria,Fifteen. Reasonable.
basquiat,It's unfinished.  How 'bout some blue in the corner?
shenge,Blue? Where?
basquiat,What's wrong with you today?
maria,I love these.
maria, Who are you selling these through now?
basquiat,"Well, that's better.  You can buy direct from me."
ellen,Look at these - silkscreens? What're you? Andy Warhol Junior? It's like - not even handmade anymore.
mary boone,Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
basquiat,I need a dealer.
mary boone,"You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert Milo walks in from another room."
albert milo,Hey Jean!  It'll never fit.
mary boone,It'll be ok.
albert milo,You better take a look. Why's your door so small? The ceilings are sixteen feet and your door's the size of a mouse hole!
albert milo, You doing anything right now?
basquiat,Naa..
albert milo,Let's get out of here.
basquiat,See ya in an hour.  So what do you think?
mary boone,Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
basquiat,I'm here.
mary boone,OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock.
albert milo,"This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else.."
basquiat,Do you ever get sick of it?
albert milo,Of what?
basquiat,The whole thing - painting.
albert milo,No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every
basquiat,What about the shit they write?
albert milo,"You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them."
basquiat,I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
albert milo,"As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?"
albert milo,Alright. I'll be right up.
stella, Hi.
basquiat,Hi.
stella,I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
stella,Some of them.
basquiat,Stand still.
stella,Thanks
albert milo,Where's Jean?
stella,He just left.
basquiat,B.B. It's me - Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?
basquiat,What do you mean?
bruno,You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
angle on, The duck lying in the street.
basquiat,Hello? Gina?
male voice,Who is it?
angle up, Gina and Benny look out the window into the street.  Jean's a block away.
basquiat,"Hey, come here! Please. Just for a second. Open the door."
basquiat,Open up! Open up!
guard,Come back tomorrow. Visiting hours are over.  Don't cause any trouble.
basquiat,I'm not here to visit... I wanna take her home.
guard,Don't cause any trouble.
street sounds, BENNY  Willie Mays.  FADE IN:
basquiat,Willie Mays... Nice to see you.
benny,She's good.
basquiat,I guess it was a long time ago.
benny,"Come on, let's get out of here."
benny,Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
benny,Drugs??!
basquiat,"Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!"
clerk,You starting a hospital?
basquiat,Just ring it up. I don't need a bag.  Try this tabouli - it's great...
