sherman,"Come on, Marshall. Come here. Stay. Come on. Stay."
judy,"You are not taking the dog for a walk. You are taking 'Marshall' for a walk. Marshall has a name. He is one of our family. And, anyway, it's raining. SHERMAN I know that. The DOG GROWLS and snaps at Sherman."
judy,"So does Marshall. I don't think he wants to go. Do you, Marshall?                     * SHERMAN Judy... JUDY Alright.   Alright. Sherman gets the leash fastened. He stands up, pulls on a rubberized British riding mac. Judy flicks a tiny plastic bag out of a cleverly-concealed container and hands it to Sherman. JUDY Have a nice time. 14    OMITTED                                                      14 &                                                                  & 15                                                                 15"
sherman,"Neither am I, Bill."
sherman,"Yes, of course. Come on, Marshall."
sherman,"Good evening, Pollard. POLLARD You know it's raining, don't you? SHERMAN Yes. As a matter of fact, I did notice. POLLARD Ah, Sherman. A true friend to man's best friend. SHERMAN Pollard, you old phrase-maker."
pollard,I beg your pardon.
sherman,"I mean, is that the best you can do? Is that as witty as we get?"
sherman,Maria!    Hello. It's me.
judy,"Sherman, if you want to talk to somebody named Maria, why do you call me instead? Sherman pokes his head into the room."
sherman,"If I what?   Whatever do you mean? JUDY Please don't lie. It makes your                       * forehead crinkle.                                     * SHERMAN About what? Wait a minute.     What are we talking about? JUDY You should see your face. It's a                      * veritable roadmap of tension and                      * deceit.                                               * SHERMAN I'm sorry, but I don't get it. Have I missed something? JUDY Darling, the only thing you're                        * missing is common sense. You're                       * going to stand there and tell me you didn't call here and ask to speak to some Maria?"
sherman,Who? 
sherman,"Judy, I was out walking the dog. I was not on the telephone."
judy,"Crinkle, crinkle, crinkle.                             * SHERMAN I'm not   lying. I took Marshal for a walk,   and I come back in here and wham   -- I mean I hardly know what to   say. You're asking me to prove a   negative proposition."
judy,"'Negative proposition'?! Oh, God, Sherman. Listen to the way I sound. Listen to the stress. Can                       * you hear it? I don't want to be                        * this person. I don't. I am thin. I am beautiful. I don't deserve this. She gets off the bike, grabs a robe and heads for the door."
sherman,"Judy... JUDY There's the phone. Why don't you just call her from here? I don't care. I really don't care. You are cheap and rotten and a liar,                       * and you are dripping on the                            * Aubusson carpet.                                       * She goes. Sherman collapses in a chair.       He looks at the phone. PETER  She was right, of course. And Sherman knew it. Christ. How could he have been so stupid? A simple phone call... DISSOLVE TO:"
sherman,"Campbell, honey. Are we ready? CAMPBELL I'm out of here. SHERMAN Slow down.    Where's your mother?"
judy,She won't kiss me because I'm all wet.
sherman,"Campbell, kiss your mother. Campbell kisses Judy. "
doorman,"Bill, sir.   My name is Bill."
sherman,"Yes, of course. Campbell, say hello to Tony."
campbell,"Hi, Bill. DOORMAN 'Morning, Campbell."
another man,"If you can't see the goddamn screen, then I can't help you. If you can't see what the hell we're talking about, then what are we talking about?! THIRD MAN Well, then why do you think everybody's stripping the twenty years?! 33     ANGLE - BLACK SHOESHINE MAN                                     33"
fourth man,"Bid eight and a half. And then I want you to work hard on this, see what's happening with the escrow, do they forfeit or no? FIFTH    MAN This Goldman order    really fucked things up. And the     banks are calling it 73. Why     are they pissing on us like    that? "
seventh man,"I'm telling you somebody's painting you a fucking picture! Can't you see that?! I'm telling you to swap them. You got all this downside protection if the Jap market rallies. Just do it, do it, do it!"
sherman,Calm. Cool. Colated. Let's not lose our composure over a few hundred million dollars.
rawlie,"Jesus Christ, Sherman.    You must be made of ice."
sherman,"I'm confident on this, Gene.   It's a real sleeping beauty. A THROTTLED ROAR comes out of the SPEAKER. RAWLIE Where are you, Gene?"
sherman,"What do you say, Gene.   Are we in or out? "
sherman,"A rich old man, Gene.   A rich old man. Another ROAR of the CROWD comes over the SPEAKERS. GENE "
sherman,"At ease, gentlemen. The meeting breaks up."
maria,"Oh, dear. Are we going to talk about it right now?"
sherman,Yes.   We have to.
maria,"Don't you want a little poon tang first? SHERMAN Maria.   Please. This is important. MARIA Alright.   Tell mama all about it. 40    EXT. MERCEDES - NIGHT                                          40 moving off the Van Wyck and onto the Grand Central Parkway. 41    INT. MERCEDES - SHERMAN AND MARIA - NIGHT                      41 Maria is laughing. She is fiddling with the back of Sherman's neck and chewing on his ear while her other hand is in his crotch. Maria is laughing.                           * SHERMAN I know it has its funny side but it isn't funny. MARIA Well, it's your own fault for                          * getting caught like a red herring.                     * SHERMAN You mean red-handed.                                   *"
maria,That's what I said... Couldn't we                      * just forget about your wife and                        * go on over to our little hideaway                      * on 59th Street and hide away a                         * little?                                                * 
maria,"Well, of course she knows.   That's not the point."
sherman,"It isn't? MARIA Oh, Sherman, honey. You are so sweet. I could eat you alive, if I could get this zipper down. Sherman, aren't we supposed to turn there?"
sherman,"Where? 42    HIS POV - SIGN                                               42 reading ""Manhattan"" way off to the right, several full lanes away. MARIA  I'm sure that's the turnoff to Manhattan."
sherman,We're in the Bronx.
maria,What does that mean? SHERMAN It means we're going north. All I need to do is make a left and go                         * west and find a street back to Manhattan.
maria,"Sherman? SHERMAN Yes, Maria."
maria,Where are all the white people?
maria,"Sherman, get us out of here.                             * SHERMAN I have a red light."
sherman,"Maria! MARIA Drive, Sherman. Just drive."
maria,It's a body. SHERMAN It looks like...
maria,It's an animal.
sherman,"I think it's a... MARIA Is it dead? SHERMAN It's a wheel, that's all.   It's a tire. MARIA It's a dead tire! SHERMAN Calm down, Maria. Please. It's a tire and some ash cans or something. Sherman starts to get out of the car. MARIA What are you doing?!"
sherman,"Well, I can't drive around it, can I?"
maria,"You're going to move it? SHERMAN Yes. That's exactly what I'm going to do. MARIA For God's sake, be careful of your shoes."
sherman,Excuse me.   I have to go. 
roland,Where you going with that tire?
sherman,"Oh. Is this yours? Here.    You take it. Sherman pushes the tire toward Roland. Roland pushes it back at him. Sherman throws up his arms. The tire bounces off his arms and knocks Roland down. SHERMAN Oh. Sorry.   I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... 65   ANGLE - MARIA                                                65 HONKS the HORN again and drives the car toward Sherman. 66   ANGLE - SHERMAN                                              66"
sherman,Look out! 73   ANGLE - ROLAND                                               73
maria,The police?
sherman,I mean we were almost robbed and I think maybe it's possible you... we hit one of them. There was this kind of... There was this sound. Did you hear it? Like we hit one of them. MARIA Did you see him get hit? SHERMAN No.
maria,"Neither did I. So if the question ever comes up, all that happened was, two boys blocked the road and tried to rob us and we got away. That's all we know. They go into... 83   INT. BROWNSTONE - SHERMAN AND MARIA - NIGHT               83 climbing the stairs."
sherman,"But if we called the police now... MARIA Yes, let's call them and invite them over here to our little love nest. They would love to get their hands on us. The police and the press and all the rest of the 'mediarites.' SHERMAN Meteorites?"
sherman,"I'd just feel better if... Maria drops everything and turns on him... MARIA You don't have to feel better, Sherman. I was the one who was driving. And I'm saying I didn't hit anybody, and I'm not reporting anything to the police! And if you are a gentleman, you will support me in that decision. Silence. They are both out of breath. They look at each other. Then Maria starts to unbutton her blouse."
maria, We were in the jungle... we were attacked... we fought our way out. SHERMAN It's true.   We could have been killed. MARIA We fought.   I feel like an animal.
sherman,You drove the hell out of that car.
maria,"The hard part was getting into the seat, getting over that gear shift."
sherman,It was instinct. MARIA That tire...
sherman,He was big... wasn't he?
maria,"You were bigger, Sherman.    You were great..."
sherman,"We were both great. MARIA This could be the best sex we've had in a long time. SHERMAN I don't know.    I still think... MARIA Don't think, Sherman.    Don't think. Just fuck."
kramer," What did he do? RAY He pulled a knife on a seventy- year-old lady, robbed her, raped her and then shoved her in a garbage can."
kramer,Jesus.
ray, Welcome to the South Bronx.
clerk,People versus Harold Williams. Indictment number 294721.                              * JUDGE WHITE This case was dismissed three weeks ago. 
kramer,"Uh, Kramer, sir. Assistant District... JUDGE WHITE                           * You're new here, Mr. Kramer. Let me explain something to you. This case is what we call a piece of shit. Which means, loosely translated, that you have no evidence. KRAMER Your Honor, the District Attorney, Mr. Weiss... JUDGE WHITE                           * I know who the district attorney is. I know Mr. Weiss. And the only reason Mr. Weiss is interested in the case is because Mr. Williams over there is a white man who lives in a nice big house in Riverdale. KRAMER I don't follow, sir... JUDGE WHITE                           * Because this is an election year. Because ninety-nine percent of the people you shovel through here are black and the other ninety-nine percent don't even speak English. But they do vote. "
judge white,"So you go tell your boss, the district attorney, Captain Ahab Weiss that I know he's out there looking for the great white defendent... but Mr. Williams over there is not it."
martin,I'm Martin. This is Detective Goldberg. We just come from Lincoln Hospital. You got a minute? 
goldberg,"Hit and run. KRAMER The mother tell you this, too?"
ray,"So why are you coming to us? You got a victim who's unconscious, you got no witness, no driver -- you got what we call here a piece of shit. Ain't that right, Mr. Kramer? Martin and Goldberg look at each other."
martin,"What we got here is a problem. GOLDBERG You ever hear of Reverend Bacon? RAY Oh, no. Not me. Kramer, this is all yours. I'll see you gentlemen later. Andruitti turns and goes."

BACON This is your evidence... 98   ANGLE TO INCLUDE MRS. ANNIE LAMB                               98 coming up the aisle behind them.                                    *"
kramer,"Oh, sorry, ma'am. I didn't see..."
bacon,"Mrs. Lamb is not speaking to the police. Until we have proper counsel, I will speak for her."
kramer,"Alright, then. Let me see if I have this straight. The boy was hit by a car..."
bacon,"On Bruckner Boulevard. Innocently walking along, minding his own business... A clear case of hit-and-run. "
bacon,"You got what he told his mother. KRAMER That's hearsay. You may believe it and I may believe it, but it's not admissable in a court of law. BACON If this boy was born on Park Avenue and he was run down by two niggers in a Pontiac Firebird, then you'd have a case! Wouldn't you?! MARTIN I work Park Avenue and I work Bruckner Boulevard, Reverend. There's good and bad in both places. Now we'll do everything we can for this lady. But we don't have a hell of a lot to go on. BACON Gentlemen, I want you to make an investment here. An investment in steam control. KRAMER Steam control? BACON That's right. Steam control. Because a righteous steam is building up in the souls of my people and that steam is ready to blow."
kramer,I see.   Well...
bacon,"Now, on judgment day, I am your safety valve. Because when it blows -- and it will, my friend -- how grateful you will be that I am on your side -- the one nigger who can control the steam and save your lily white ass from being burned off the face of the earth so to speak. "
kramer,"Well, Reverend. I'll see what I can do."
bacon,"The next time you gentlemen hear from us, it will be through our lawyer. Mrs. Lamb goes to Kramer. MRS. LAMB He said it started with an 'R.' That was the first letter. The second letter was an 'E' or a 'B' or maybe a 'P.' Those were the first two letters of the license plate. If that's any help to you. 99    EXT.

sherman,"My father did it. JDUY You are not your father. PETER FALLOW  She knew how to hurt a guy. No. He was nothing like his father. His father, the lion of Dunning, Sponget and Leach. His father, who took the subway to work every day of his life. His father, who still believed in principals and ethics, whose repeated lessons concerning duty, debt and responsibility had whistled through his son's head. No. Sherman McCoy was nothing like his father. 102   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - PORCH - DAY                                102"
campbell,But what's a bond?
sherman,"No, I don't actually build them... MR. McCOY I think you're in over your head. More laughter."
judy,"Here. Let me try. Darling, Daddy doesn't build roads or hospitals or anything, really. Daddy just handles the bonds for the people who raise the money. CAMPBELL That's what he said. Bonds."
judy,"Yes. See, just imagine that a bond is a slice of cake. Now you didn't bake that cake, but every time you hand somebody a slice of that cake, a little bit comes off, little crumbs fall off. And you're allowed to keep those crumbs. "
judy," Yes. And that's what Daddy does. He passes somebody else's cake around and picks up the crumbs. But you have to imagine a lot of crumbs. And a great golden cake. And a lot of golden crumbs. And you have to imagine Daddy running around picking up every little golden crumb he can get his hands on. That's what Daddy does. SHERMAN Well, you can call them crumbs if you want to... JUDY That's the best I can do.   Excuse me."
sherman,"Yes.   Well... MR. McCOY Now it's not about anything, is it? Except the money. SHERMAN I don't make the rules."
sherman,We're having a little... It's nothing serious. Really.
peter,"Yes. And a very pretty someone he is, too."
caroline," This is Filippo Chirazzi, the artist. This is Peter Fallow, the has-been."
peter,Enchante.   We're a little crowded. 
caroline,"No thanks, Peter. The last time I sat on your face, I ended up with a yeast infection."
evelyn,Lovely.
moore, This is one of my invisible employees. One of the many journalists who are supposed to be writing for my newspaper. You're very fortunate to see him because I hardly ever do.
peter,"Gerald, have a drink.     Please, I can explain. "
moore,"I sincerely hope so, Fallow. I sincerely hope so. Come, Evelyn."
albert,When the rights of any people are threatened -- no matter how big or how small -- Albert Fox will always be on the case.
peter,"Well, yeah, but... Look, it's an unfortunate situation. But I'm not altogether sure there's a story in it. FOX A poor, innocent black kid, walking down the street, minding his own business. And boom! Hit and run. There's a story in it for somebody, Peter. The black community is up in arms. And I'm telling you, when Reverend Bacon gets a feather in his ass, the shit flies high. PETER I see. Yes, but what's your interest exactly? FOX I'm a lawyer, Peter. I want to see justice done. That's all. And, of course, Reverend Bacon is a friend of mine. This would be good for him. And knowing a little about                        * your situation, I thought if you were the one to break the story... PETER My situation? "

fox,Yes.    I think she does.    Yes.   Why? PETER I'll have a Scotch and water.                                * FOX Good.    Good.   Get in. They get into the limo. 115    INT. MOTOR VEHICLE OFFICE - COMPUTER SCREEN - NIGHT                115
assistant,"You'll read all about it in the newspapers. Come on. Let's do R.E., R.P. and R.B. and see what we get."
rifkin,Henry Lamb?   Who's that?
peter,He was a student of yours at Ruppert High. In your English class. RIFKIN He was?   What's he done?
peter,He was seriously injured. I'm a journalist. I write for a newspaper. RIFKIN Oh.   I don't remember him.
peter,"What I would like to find out is what kind of student he was. RIFKIN Well, if I don't remember him, I guess he was okay. PETER Would you say he was a 'good' student? RIFKIN 'Good' doesn't really apply to Ruppert High. They're either cooperative or life-threatening. There's no in-between."
peter,His mother says he was considering going to college.
rifkin,"Well, she means City College. They have an open admissions policy. So, if you live in the city and you graduate from high school and you're still breathing, they have to take you. "
peter,Fallow.
rifkin,I got sixty-five students in every class...
peter,"Do you have any of his written work? RIFKIN Oh, Jesus, there hasn't been any written work at Ruppert High since... oh, fifteen years. Maybe twenty. PETER Well, there must be some record of how he measures up to the others... RIFKIN No. See, you're thinking about grades and honor students and high achievers. We don't make those kinds of comparisons. We're just trying to keep them off the street. At Ruppert High, an honor student is somebody who comes to class and doesn't piss on the teacher."
peter," Well, by that standard, is Henry Lamb an honors student?"
rifkin,"Well, he never pissed on me. So by that standard, yes. I guess he must be."
sherman, Holy fucking shit. I want out!    I want out!! 128   OMITTED                                                       128   * &                                                                   & 129                                                                 129   * 130   EXT.

maria,"Sherman, darling. I was just thinking about you. Where have you been? "
maria,Don't I get a kiss first? SHERMAN Have you read it?
maria,"Oh, Sherman, you know I only read the newspapers spasmodically."
sherman,"Sporatically, Maria. Sporatically. MARIA Yes. Me, too. Now come on in and have a drink. I know just what you need."
sherman,Absolutely wrong! All of it. And who is this Peter Fallow? He has everything wrong. They don't even mention the other boy. And what about the ramp and the tire?! They're talking about a little saint here who was on his way to get milk and cookies for his widowed mother. As they go into the building...

maria,"Well, uh... I don't live here. I'm just a guest of Miss Heftshank. So..."
workman,Okay.   No problem. I'm all done. He packs up and leaves.
maria,"Nothing. Caroline pays $351 for this place. It's rent controlled. I sublet it for eleven hundred a month. But it's not legal. They would love to get Caroline out of here. But they have to prove she doesn't live here. SHERMAN You don't think it's weird this fellow showed up today. After that unconscionable piece in the paper. MARIA Oh, Sherman. You are    completely paranoidical. Look, I    have to leave for the airport   in twenty minutes. So we don't    have much time. * SHERMAN You don't think they could possibly trace the car to me?"
sherman,"Right. There is the other boy, however. Suppose he came forward."
maria,"If he was gonna materialize, he would have done it by now. And the reason he hasn't, is because he's a criminal. Would you get my blue jacket out of that closet? Sherman gets the jacket.     Maria starts putting a painting        * into her portfolio.                                                 * SHERMAN What a wretched painting."
maria,"Filippo Chirazzi. He's a friend of Caroline. Do you know him? SHERMAN I hope not.   God, Maria, it looks like you. MARIA No. No. How could it be? Come on, give me a hand. I'm taking it with me."
sherman,"Where are you going? MARIA The airport. I told you. I have a car coming in -- oh, God, ten minutes. We have time for a quickie. What do you say?"
sherman,"I'm upset, Maria. I just lost 600 million dollars. And possibly my job. I don't feel terrifically sexy at the moment."

sherman,"No. I just think... I think that, just to be sure, certain, safe... I think... GOLDBERG Let me put it this way, if you want to cooperate, that's great. If you have reasons for not cooperating, then I should tell you that you don't have to say anything. That's your right. If you want, you can say nothing at all. You also have the right to an attorney. I mean, for that matter, if you lacked the 'funds' for an attorney, the state would provide you with one -- free of charge.   If that's what you wanted."

sally,What am I saying? Of course it's a bad time. But I just wanted to see if I can be of any help.
sally,You know I haven't been in this apartment since the McCleods had it. That was before the Kittridges. I hope I'm not being out of place. SHERMAN Not at all... uh... SALLY Sally.
sherman,"Anyway, thank you. SALLY No, really, anything I can do. With the apartment, is what I mean."
sherman,The apartment? SALLY I find people often need to be as liquid as they can in these situations and I know I can get you seven-and-a-half right at this moment. Fabled aristocratic tycoon -- it's the celebrity appeal. Maybe eight. If we act quickly this kind of opportunity doesn't come along every day. You have to ride the wave. SHERMAN Excuse me.

pollard,Sorry to interrupt your dinner.
sherman,"Not at all.   The more the merrier. POLLARD I've been in touch with the co-op board, well, most of them, and we want you to know you have our support."
sherman,"You know, at first I wanted to die. Standing there in court, people calling my name... POLLARD Yes.   Of course. Hard to believe. SHERMAN And then I thought, I have a gun. Twelve gauge. Double barrel... FOLLOW them INTO..."
pollard,Yes. This can't be a comfortable situation for you. 
pollard,Well...
sherman,This is my home... POLLARD I understand that... SHERMAN This is the only safe place I have. People are threatening my life. I have to protect myself. He loads the gun and fills his pockets with shells. POLLARD There are people demonstrating in front of our building. Black people with basketballs! You're putting everyone at risk. It's not your fault. But that doesn't alter the facts. FOLLOW Sherman and Pollard OUT of the study TO...
pollard,"You are a shareholder in a cooperative. Look, we're not asking you to do anything of a permanent nature... "
sherman,And you can start by moving out of this apartment right now. Out! Now!
sherman,"Oh, Pollard, you were a ridiculous fat blowhard at Buckley and you're a ridiculous fat blowhard now. Everyone watches as Sherman holds Pollard at gunpoint and steers him out of the room. POLLARD I will have to enforce the provision concerning unacceptable situations. SHERMAN Another word out of you, Pollard, and there's going to be an unacceptable situation right up                          * your ass! Now march!                                     * The guests applaud.    Sherman turns to face them."
sherman,"And that goes for the rest of you, too. Out. All of you."
sherman,Out! Stinking lot of anorexic parasites. Get out of my house! 
sherman,"Out of my house, out of my life!"

evelyn,"Daddy.    Dinner. MOORE Yes, darling. Shall we have Peter here come along with us?"
evelyn,Lovely. Gerald and Evelyn lead Peter toward the back dining room.
moore,"I want to give this story our full attention, Peter. It makes us look better and better, the more we do for this Lamb family. Poor little Lambs, poor little fuzzy-wuzzy wogs. Caroline Heftshank intercepts them.     She is very drunk."
caroline,"Excuse me, Peter. There's a phone call for you upstairs in the office."
peter,Where's the phone? 
caroline,"You don't deserve this, Peter. But I'm going to tell you something.                         * * She reaches under her skirt and pulls off her panties. She drops them on the floor."
peter,"Listen, Caroline. I'm sort of with some people tonight. CAROLINE Relax, darling. Do you remember my pretty little Italian friend? The painter."
peter,"Yes. Yes, I do. Franco or Federico... CAROLINE Filippo.   The little shit. Caroline climbs up on the desk, lifts her skirt and sits down on the Xerox machine."
peter,"Caroline, you're absolutely soused."
caroline,"Well, Filippo has run off with a little slut you should know about.                     *"
peter,You're joking. CAROLINE I never joke.    She was in the car. PETER But how do you know all this?
caroline,The apartment was bugged. They had a wire in the intercom. They were trying to prove that I wasn't living there. Which I wasn't. Now I've lost the apartment and the boyfriend.
peter,You don't know where they are? CAROLINE No. But I'm trusting you to find them. And when you do. Give them this. Tell them this is the little lady who turned them in. She takes one of the Xerox copies and hands it to Peter. Peter leaves. Caroline looks at the Xerox copy. CAROLINE Maybe I should advertise... 251   OMITTED                                                         251
peter,Yes. We've never met but I'm a good friend of... your wife.
arthur," Give me a Couvoisier V.S.O.P. No. Put it in a sidecar. PETER Yes.   Uh... where is Maria, by the way?"
arthur,"Italy. Every time I turn around, she's in Italy. I'm not supposed to drink. But I love a sidecar. It was Willi Nordhoff introduced me to them. So. You're on the City Light? PETER Uh, yes. And we're doing a little profile piece. We're calling it the 'New Tycoons.' And, naturally, we thought of you."
arthur,"Good. Good. I like that. New tycoons. So what do you want to know? PETER Oh, there's no hurry. So Maria is in Italy. Where abouts?"
arthur,She's in Lake Como someplace.
peter,"Well, there are some great hotels in Lake Como. Is she at the Excelsior?"
peter,"I'd like to talk to her, too. If I could. If I could get in                        * touch with her...                                    * "
arthur,They think this is the way you stop an airplane. 
peter,I think you'd better call someone.
peter,What?
peter,Mrs. Ruskin? MARIA Yes?
peter,"My name is Peter Fallow. I just wanted to offer my sympathy. MARIA  How very kind. Did you know Arthur? PETER Ah, well, yes. I was actually quite close to him when he died. MARIA I've reprobated myself over and over again for being away..."
peter,You shouldn't.
maria,"Well, thank you for the kind words. I must go now."
peter,Yes. Just one other thing. I understand you're a friend of Sherman McCoy.
maria,I'm sorry...? 
maria,Sherman would never tell you that.
peter,I was hoping you might tell me exactly what happened that night.
maria,"Look, Mr.... Mr.... PETER Fallow. MARIA ... Peckerhead. I am here for my husband's funeral. Understand? Now go away. Disappear. Disintegrate. She gets into the car.

fox,What kind of muckracking yellow journalist are you!? You print a story like this without so much as a by-your-leave to me or to Reverend Bacon here! Who the hell do you think you are.
fox,So what?! So what?!   So what?! This is our case.
fox,Right here. You see? It's the hospital that's the guilty party. PETER The hospital?! What are you talking about? FOX A young man comes in here with a cerebral concussion and they treat him for a broken wrist. That is our case! That is the lawsuit that we are going to bring against this hospital. That is what we have been working toward all this time. And you are confusing the issue! Do you understand me?!
peter,"Alright, alright. But Christ, Albert, this is a great story. This is my exclusive. And it's also the truth! BACON It's a little late for you to start telling the truth, isn't it, Pete? PETER I can't just drop this now.   I can't just let it go."
bacon,"That's right. You're our boy, Peter. You take care of us and we'll take care of you. I promise you, that's going to be a very profitable relationship for all of us. Suddenly, Annie starts to weep."
bacon,"Annie, I know that nothing can heal the wound that you have suffered. But ten million dollars in damages will certainly make your grief more comfortable. ANNIE Well, yes, I could use a few things, Reverend, thank you. I been worried about my clothes for instance. I feel that the presentation of my person should be carefully designed. As a model to black mothers everywhere, I think I should have the right wardrobe. So if you could have Mr. Fox's limousine pick me up in the morning, I could do some shopping."
fox,"Why certainly. ANNIE I'll need some furniture, too. And a new refrigerator. And although I should probably continue to live in that shithole of an apartment at least until after the lawsuit is settled, I would like to start looking now for a co-op in Manhattan -- for me and my son -- something with a view of the river and preferably in a neighborhood that is at least upwardly mobile. Pause as they all look at her."
weiss,"Shut up, you asshole."
kramer,"Yes, sir. "
andriutti,"I think we better talk to this Mrs. Ruskin. WEISS You go to the press. You tell them we're going to question the woman, and if she is the woman who was in the car, she faces possible charges, etcetera, etcetera."
andriutti,"Alright. WEISS And you, Mr. Wise-Guy-Know-It-All- Shitface, you're the one got us into this, you're going to get us out. You go to this broad, you tell her she's in a whole lot of trouble, lay it on. But, but, but -- if she is willing to cooperate, if she will say what we want her to say, then we will grant her immunity. KRAMER Yes, sir. WEISS Go on, go.   What are you waiting for?"
kramer,Well today is her husband's funeral.                     *

leach,Yeah? PETER I understand you been doing some creative wiring in this building. Peter and Leach continue talking.
sherman,That's us! That's me! That's Maria! How did you get this? 
sherman,"What do you mean, 'my tape'?"
killian,"Well, if you were wired and you recorded your own conversation that would be okay. But there is no way that this tape can be used as evidence in a court of law."
sherman,Then what good is it?
sherman,An idea about what?
killian,An idea about what to wear when you go to this funeral. SHERMAN What funeral? 263    OMITTED                                                          263
maria,"I see. Well, here we are, Sherman. The couple that all New York is talking about. And we're not even a couple anymore."
maria,"Oh, Sherman. Would I do that to you? Sherman, Sherman, Sherman. She embraces him, her hands moving toward the hidden recorder. Sherman takes both her hands and pulls them to his chest. MARIA What are we going to do with you?"
sherman,"You have to help me, Maria. MARIA But how can I help you? SHERMAN Well, I know this may sound like a strange request, but you could start by telling the police what really happened."
maria,"Oh, Sherman, you are the sweetest thing. But I'm not sure anybody knows what really happened. Not anymore. And if anybody does know, it certainly isn't me. SHERMAN But you were driving the car that night. MARIA Was I? I don't remember. Isn't it funny how a little thing like that can slip your mind?  God, there's something about funerals that is so stimulating. My panties have been wet all morning."
sherman,"Maria, please... She kisses him again."
director,"And now, in accordance with the wishes of Mr. Ruskin..."
maria,Sherman.   What's wrong with you?
sherman,Nothing. MARIA Then why are you all hunched over? Her hands slide down his back.
sherman,"Maria, we have to talk. MARIA Sherman, what's this on your back?"
sherman,My what? 
maria,You don't have a belt buckle in the back. There's some sort of subterfuge afoot here. Isn't there? SHERMAN Don't be silly.
maria,You are secreting something on your body! SHERMAN Maria...
maria,I want to see what it is. She rips open his shirt.
sherman,"Maria, are you crazy! MARIA And a wire!    A wire! She pulls the wire. Sherman yelps in pain. As he spins around, Maria grabs the tapedeck and pulls it off his back. More pain. SHERMAN Eeeooowww!!!"
maria,"You rotten, dishonest bastard!"
sherman,"Maria, I didn't want to do this, but you gave me no choice. A KNOCK at the door.       They freeze."
maria,"My, my, my, Mr. McCoy. I'd say your goose was just about home- fried."
sherman," I have protected you, Maria. I have been a gentleman. I have done my best to keep your name out of this. But you have got to help me. You have got to do the right thing. MARIA Never. Never.
