dean,You're drivin'?
dean,"Alright, lead foot. It's not a race."
cindy,Isn't it funny how you can be driving for 20 minutes and it feels like you've only been driving for 20 seconds. The time just gets swallowed up somewhere...
dean,Do you mind if I turn this back on?
cindy,I was kind of enjoying the silence.
dean,Let's just see if there's something on...

glenda,I thought it would be nice.
jerry,Nice?
glenda,...for a change...
jerry,"Well, what gave you the idea that any of us needed a change? Did you ask for a change? Cindy? She doesn't ask for anything... She doesn't talk. You didn't ask for a change, did you mom?...She can't hear! And I don't remember asking for a change. So, it was you, wasn't it? You wanted a change.

cindy,"Okay, shhh. But you gotta be quiet."
cindy,No.
dean,"You do. No, you do. I know that you do. And the reason that I know that you do is - I have stolen money before... a lot of it. And I know what it feels like to have someone look at you like that..."

dean,What about the girl that was with you?
gramma,Who?
dean,Hi.
cindy,Hi.
dean,"I just had a long talk with your gramma... is that, is that your gramma?"
cindy,I think he passed away.
dean,That's exactly what happened to my dog. My parents moved out of our house and three days later she was a goner.
cindy,She was pretty too..
dean,She must have been crazy.
cindy,Why do you say that?
dean,"Cause there's one thing I know... the prettier a girl is the more nuts she is. I mean, look at you... you must be insane."
cindy,Excuse me?
dean,"It's okay, I mean, I get it. It's not your fault."
cindy,Home.

dean,No.
dean,What's in there?
cindy,Okay enough...
dean,Why?
cindy,Because.
cindy,Aren't you gonna miss your train?

cindy,Why don't you do something...
dean,Like what?
cindy,I don't know... isn't there anything you want to do?
dean,What am I supposed to want to do?
cindy,I don't know... You have so many things you could do. You're good at everything. You could do anything you wanted.
dean,I just wanna be with you.
cindy,Like right before the bear eats the man?
dean,Yeah... You do. It's true. That's what you look like.
cindy,How different we are. You and me.
dean,Different?
cindy,It's a good thing.
dean,You think that's good that we're different?
cindy,Absolutely. We don't have to get in each other's way.
dean,"And that's the way you like it, don't you? You don't like me to bother you."
cindy,I didn't say that. What I meant is that it's important for us to have our space. That's all. We're grown people.
dean,Well there's not much space here. So I guess you won't be able to get away from me will ya?
cindy,"You know, we rarely sit down and have a conversation. An adult conversation. Because every time we do, you turn something that I say around and make it mean something that I didn't mean to say. You just blab. Blab."
dean,If you're not interested in hearing what I think I just won't say anything.
cindy,Good luck. I just want you to think about what you say sometimes instead of saying what you think all the time.
dean,"OK. I'm going to say something. And what I'm about to say I've thought long and hard about. I'm the luckiest person alive because I'm living my dream - you, her, this, us, all of it."
cindy,I think my glass has a hole in it.
dean,What's wrong with that?
cindy,It's fat.
dean,That's the flavor. Eat it.
cindy,I don't want to. You eat it.
dean,My tits? I got tits?

cindy,Yeah.
doctor,I want you to try and relax. This is going to be a little cold.
cindy,I'm a student...
doctor,What are you studying?
cindy,I'm studying to be a DOCTOR...
doctor,That's what I studied.
cindy,What's that?
doctor,This is a mild anesthetic for your cervix. You're going to feel a pinch and then it's going to feel like electricity.

dean,Who is it?
cindy,"It's me, Dean. I didn't want to hurt you. But I'm not the person you fell in love with. And you won't let me be anything but that person. That's why I can't look at you. Because every time I do I can't stop thinking about how much I want you to hate me. But you're too stupid to see it, and too chicken shit to do anything about it."
dean,Wait a second...
cindy,I don't love you anymore... Why can't you stop loving me?
