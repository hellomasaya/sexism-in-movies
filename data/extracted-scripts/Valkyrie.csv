Speaker,Dialogue
tresckow,Managing the Fhrer's security must be quite an undertaking.
brandt, Irregularity is the Fhrer's precaution of choice.
tresckow,"I can assure you he's safe here. Relax, Brandt. Enjoy your meal."
tresckow,With my regards to Colonel Stieff.
brandt,Cointreau? You better hope I don't get thirsty on the flight.
tresckow,He's... landed.
aide,What about the...
tresckow,Get me Colonel Brandt...  Colonel? Tresckow... I trust you landed safely... I hate to trouble you but there's been a bit of a mix up. It seems you have the wrong bottles for Colonel Stieff. You... do still have the package?
aide,Do you think he knows?
tresckow,There's only one way to be sure...
olbricht,Oster's been arrested. The Gestapo came for him last night.
tresckow,The Gestapo could have arrested him for anything. Find a replacement.
olbricht,There's no one we can trust. Not in Berlin.
tresckow,Then stop looking in Berlin.
sentry,Your pistol please.
tresckow,I beg your pardon.
brandt,You've come a long way. You must be thirsty.
tresckow,"I wonder how the Fhrer, who does not partake, would feel about an officer who did so on duty... Colonel Brandt."
brandt,"I took you for another sort, General."
tresckow,And I you.
young lieutenant,"Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. A new headquarters has been established at Mezzouna. I'm to take you there."
stauffenberg,"Now they tell us to disengage - a day late. No matter how many times we tell Command the reality, they always manage to leave us-"
young lieutenant,"Colonel, the enemy is less than five kilometers from here. You've done all you can."
stauffenberg,I wonder... Was there even a point in our coming to Tunis?
young lieutenant,"To get taken prisoner, it seems."
stauffenberg,"STOP. WAIT UNTIL THEY COMMIT.  The men calm when they see the Colonel, trusting him. They turn and watch the formation of planes complete their turn and bear down, gaining speed. Knees tense, some jerking from the natural inclination to flee.  STAUFFENBERG  STAND FAST, I SAID.  They do, despite the menace of the planes' engines growing louder, meaner..."
stauffenberg,NOW.
doctor,Mrs. Stauffenberg?
nina," The Colonel's brother, Berthold."
doctor,Perhaps before you see the Colonel we should go to my office and-
nina,I will see my husband now.
doctor,He's been constant with fever but he refuses any pain killers. The right hand has been amputated above the wrist. He's lost the fourth and fifth fingers on the left. We... couldn't save the left eye.
nina,His ring.
doctor,I don't-
nina,He had a ring on his right hand. Where is it?
doctor,I'm sorry... His hand was amputated in the field... I'm afraid-
nina,Thank you.
berthold,We've lost North Africa.
stauffenberg,I don't know what I ever did with ten.
olbricht,We could use your help.
stauffenberg,I'm a field officer.
olbricht,This war can't be won in the field.
stauffenberg,That's unfortunate for me.
olbricht,You can't honestly believe you'll make a difference on the front-
stauffenberg,"I'm a soldier, General. I serve my country."
olbricht,"It makes no sense. You opposed Hitler, you opposed the war."
stauffenberg,The people chose otherwise and here we are. Now we have to win. You know what will happen if we don't.
olbricht,"If we win, it will still be Hitler's Germany."
stauffenberg,"We all took an oath, General."
olbricht,On behalf of the Fhrer.
stauffenberg,"I'm a twin, you know."
olbricht,I... I didn't.
stauffenberg,My brother died the day after we were born.
olbricht,I'm sorry.
stauffenberg,"I was lying in the desert, covered in blood, sure I was going to die. I tried to think about my wife, my children... But my mind kept drifting to my dead brother. How I would finally be with him. How I would finally be whole again...  He snaps out of his thoughts, holding up his arm.  STAUFFENBERG  This is my reward for what happened to my men. It's all I deserve.  Stauffenberg nonchalantly tosses the medal into a nearby bedpan."
stauffenberg,I don't want the damn th-
doctor,When will you be going back to the front?
stauffenberg,I'm not going to the front. I'm needed in Berlin.
witzleben,"...He is not a man, he's a lunatic. He doesn't drink, he doesn't fuck. He has no weakness to exploit, no vice to manipulate. His only passion is complete control. How can you expect to reason with him?"
goerdeler,After this most recent failure I'd say we've no other choice.
witzleben,Confront Hitler now and you'll end up with piano wire for a neck-tie. Our only option is the central solution.
goerdeler,He's a man like any other. Flesh and blood. Take him head on and-
tresckow,"I'll say this for you, Doctor... You're certainly delusional enough to take Hitler's place."
goerdeler," When that day comes, I'll be sure to remember you."
tresckow,I doubt you'll remember much of anything.
goerdeler,"Dammit, Tresckow-"
olbricht,"Gentlemen, may I present Colonel Stauffenberg. He's been reassigned to my office at the War Ministry.  Colonel, may I introduce-"
stauffenberg,These men need no introduction.
beck,"I apologize for this unfortunate... spectacle. On behalf of everyone, welc-"
goerdeler, I haven't welcomed him. Not yet. Where does he stand?
tresckow,For God's sake-
goerdeler, He's a field officer. He knows the army better than any of us. I want to hear his opinion.
stauffenberg,What makes you think the army will follow you at all?
stauffenberg,"With all respect, sir, you put too much faith in your popularity.  All of you do."
goerdeler,"Now see here, Colonel-"
stauffenberg,"You said yourself, I'm a field officer. You all may understand government, but I know the men. A great many of them may hate Hitler, but they all fear him - they fear Himmler, Goebbels, the whole of the Reich. That kind of fear won't just die with Hitler. And as for respect: the army, and the people, respect only one thing. Authority. And if just one man questions that authority, you can lose them all.  They were fooled into following Hitler... How will you fool them - force them - into following you?"
children,PAPA.
stauffenberg," It's a wonderful surprise. Thank you, brother."
children,"MAMA, COME DOWN. PAPA IS HERE. PAPA IS HERE. "
berthold,What do you mean you quit?
stauffenberg,"I came to join the Resistance, not some sewing circle of discarded generals and politicians."
berthold,"Beck is a just and capable man. As for Goerdeler, well, he's popular. He'll make a good Chancellor."
stauffenberg,"Like Hitler before him, yes? Lately I have to wonder if Germany is even fit to choose her own destiny."
berthold,You can't blame the people for this. You have to see the beginning of something to know how it'll end. It's no different than a farmer watching the corn grow. One day it's over his head.
stauffenberg,Plenty of people thought-
berthold,The greatest offenders are not the ones who thought better but the ones who sensed better.
stauffenberg,What are you trying to say?
berthold,"I seem to remember you telling me about reports from the Ukraine - the SS forcing Jews to dig their own graves. You said then that Hitler should be removed. An officer's duty, you said. What's changed?"
stauffenberg,I said senior officers. The only men that can get to him.
berthold,Perhaps it doesn't matter that you succeed.
stauffenberg,"Even if they could remove Hitler, they can't hope to seize power. For God's sake, they have no plan."
berthold,Then give them one. Find a way.
stauffenberg,"Children, that is far too-"
olbricht,We've already considered Valkyrie. It isn't suitable.
stauffenberg,Not as it's currently written.
goerdeler,Excuse me. What is Valkyrie?
tresckow,Operation Valkyrie.
goerdeler,And what use is that to us?
stauffenberg,The orders could be rewritten. A few subtle changes would put those reserve units completely under our command.
olbricht,"Yes, of course, but-"
stauffenberg,"Now what would the High Command do if they thought, say, the SS was staging a coup?"
olbricht,They would declare a military state of emergency.
tresckow,And initiate Operation Valkyrie.
stauffenberg,"Hitler's   own Reserve Army, using Hitler's   own plan and under our command,   would automatically seize power in   Berlin..."
stauffenberg,"Precisely. It will seem as though we're fighting for Hitler Government, not against it."
goerdeler,But only if Hitler's dead.
stauffenberg,I'm afraid it's the only way.
goerdeler,"I'm disappointed in you, Colonel. I thought a man of your background would appreciate a more-"
stauffenberg,"I'm a soldier first, an aristocrat second."
goerdeler,"Yes, but-"
stauffenberg,"And you're neither, Doctor. Now if you want to be Chancellor, you'll do as you're told."
beck, Can this plan be made to work?
tresckow,"Rewriting the order is one thing - distributing it is another. A bomb can be disarmed, recovered if it fails. In this case we'd be willfully circulating written evidence of high treason.  It's the best idea we've heard yet."
olbricht,There is one... small problem.
tresckow, Fromm...
goerdeler,Who is Fromm?
tresckow,"Commander of the Home Army. Olbricht can put the reserve troops on alert, but only Fromm can actually initiate Valkyrie."
beck,Can we get to him?
olbricht,He's a careerist pig.
stauffenberg,But one who's gone as high as he can go in Hitler's Army. It's no secret he's not happy about it.
tresckow,Perhaps if we offered him a key position in the new regime he could be made to see the light.
beck,We don't seem to have a choice. Without Fromm there is no Valkyrie.  Get him.
keitel,"You're a woman, Fromm. And a fat one at that. I'd have you sent to the front if I didn't think you'd surrender just to be Montgomery's whore."
herber,The... General will see you now.
fromm,What is it you want?
olbricht,I wanted to introduce you to our new man - Colonel Stauffenberg.
fromm,Ah yes - the hero from Africa. I'd offer my hand but you might not give it back.
stauffenberg,I'd say the General's lost more important things this morning.
fromm,"About time they put a man with balls in this office. Have a seat.  You too, if you must."
stauffenberg,"I am critical of losing the war, General. All wars - as in Africa - are lost through indecision."
fromm,"In the field, you mean."
stauffenberg,In Berlin.
fromm,I take it that's why you're here. To make decisions.
stauffenberg,"I've made my decision, General. I`m here to help others make theirs."
fromm,"They say when there's no clear option, one should do nothing."
stauffenberg,We're at war. We must act. Sometimes... rashly.
fromm,"Just what sort of rash action did you have in mind, Colonel?"
stauffenberg,That would be a decision for the Supreme Military Commander.
fromm,"Supreme Commander, you say."
stauffenberg,Second only to the Chancellor.
fromm,If only I were that man... This war would be going quite differently.
olbricht,We were thinking the very same thing.
fromm,"I don't need to remind you that we've all sworn an oath. That said, I'm going to forget we had this conversation with the understanding that such speak will never occur under this roof again. Am I clear?"
fromm,"Tell   your friends that I always come   down on the right side. And as long   as the Fhrer is alive, you know   what side that is."
tresckow,"Dammit, Stauffenberg. You scared me half to death."
stauffenberg,We'll be closer than that before we're finished.
tresckow,"Looking this over, I'm not satisfied that the Reserve Army is enough to shut down Berlin completely."
stauffenberg," Yes, I've been giving that some thought. We should include any field units that are home on leave."
fellgiebel,You realize how close I am to Hitler. With one word I could have the Gestapo make you disappear.
stauffenberg,Why haven't you then?
fellgiebel,"But you know. And when the SS catch you, they'll pull you apart like warm bread. It'll be a crime just to have known you then. I warn you. If it means protecting myself, I will expose you. Do not try to contact me again."
stauffenberg,"You can't report me. Maybe if you had when I first approached you, you'd have been keeping your oath. But now you're just as guilty as-"
fellgiebel,"So you think that makes me a sympathizer, eh? You give a man the choice of betraying a fellow officer or his Fhrer and assume his actions will show you his heart. It's not that simple."
stauffenberg,It is to me.
fellgiebel,"For the last time, don't push me to make a decision."
stauffenberg,I have no choice. It's clear now that without you we have no hope of success.
fellgiebel,"And what if you do, eh? What then? Will you be any different from Hitler? What of his Reich, his people, the very momentum of history? Will all of that let you be something he isn't?"
stauffenberg,No.
fellgiebel,There it is.
stauffenberg,"But my pregnant wife, our four children, the Germany I first swore to defend... They demand that I be something different. They demand that I fight for their future even if it means..."
drunken officer,Are you two finished or just getting started?
olbricht,You play the part of bureaucrat beautifully.
stauffenberg,It's the only time I can relax.
olbricht,There's a man here to interview as your adjutant.
stauffenberg,Adjut- What for?
olbricht,No one told you?  You've been promoted Chief of Staff for the Reserve Army.
stauffenberg,For Christ's sake. Don't I have enough to do?
olbricht,"Unfortunately, your nocturnal activities don't count as service to the Reich."
stauffenberg,I'll refuse the promotion.
olbricht,You'll do no such thing.
stauffenberg,"Dammit, I can't handle the work I already-"
olbricht,"This is an opportunity we could never have dreamed of. You're in the inner circle now - with genuine access to Hitler, his advisors, his schedule... We need this."
stauffenberg,We're not ready. We're moving too fast.
olbricht,"Not half as fast as the Allies. An invasion is coming, Colonel. Any day now. We must act and we must act soon."
stauffenberg,For what?
olbricht, We still need an assassin.
stauffenberg,Be seated.
haeften,"For anything, sir. Anything at all."
stauffenberg,Anything is a very dangerous word.
haeften,"Five thousand ships, one-hundred thousand men from the combined Allied forces."
stauffenberg,What about the Panzer divisions in-
haeften,They were never dispatched. Word is Hitler took a sleeping pill. His staff was afraid to wake him.
stauffenberg,"First Africa, now France."
haeften,The Russians bearing down from the East.
stauffenberg,Sometimes I wonder if Hitler's real aim is to leave nothing but scorched earth for all of Europe.
haeften,Maybe this is a blessing in disguise. Maybe he'll finally listen to reason - consider a truce while he still can.
stauffenberg,We'll see if I can't convince him.
herber,Colonel Stauffenberg is an honored guest. The hero of Africa.
fromm,"For God's sake, Stauffenberg, you're-"
fromm,Mein Fhrer... I wish to present Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg - our new Chief of General Staff for the Replacement Army.
hitler,"May I say, I am honored to meet a hero who has sacrificed so much for Germany. If only more of my officers were like you."
fromm,"Mein Fhrer, we have asked Stauffenberg here today so that he might brief us on mobilizing troops from the Home Army to support those in Normandy."
hitler,"Hmmm? Oh yes, Normandy. That will no longer be necessary. General Goering has assured me that Normandy is under control."
stauffenberg,"Mein Fhrer, if I may... The situation in Normandy is-"
keitel,"You're dismissed, Stauffenberg."
stauffenberg,But-
keitel,"Send your man home, Fromm. Then bring us some brandy."
stauffenberg,Heil Hitler.
fromm,"I don't know what you've got brewing and I don't want to know... But when the music stops, I'd be much obliged if Keitel should find himself without a chair."
stauffenberg,"They're all insane. Every one of them except for Speer, and he's nothing but an architect."
beck,Out of the question. It won't work. We need you here in Berlin.
stauffenberg,"Who else, then? Who can even get as close?"
stauffenberg,We both know there's no other way.
beck,I'll tell the others-
stauffenberg,Nonsense. You're stronger than you think. You might just be the strongest one of all.
nina,...After that I thought I'd take the children to the country for a few days to see my- Claus?
stauffenberg,The country...  Nina. Listen. I want you to delay your trip. Just for a while.
nina,Does this have something to do with... your work?
stauffenberg,I would just be more comfortable knowing where you are - until I'm back from Berlin. Things will be different then. I promise.
nina,How long until... until we see you?
stauffenberg,A few days. If all goes well. Then we can travel as a family.
nina,And if things... don't go well?
stauffenberg,"I love you, Nina."
nina,And I love you... What-
children,"PAPA, COME AND PLAY WITH US. "
nina,Go be with your children.
mertz,Two 975 gram packs of plastic-W. Enough explosive to cripple a panzer.  Your fuses. British time pencils. This acid capsule is your trigger.
olbricht,What if they search your bag?
stauffenberg,"I'm one of the inner circle now. They'll make sure I am who I am. Beyond that, they won't touch me.  How much time do I have?"
mertz,"Theoretically there's a 30-minute delay. But with the kind of heat you can expect at the Wolf's Lair, I'd give you 10, 15 minutes tops."
haeften,That's... hardly precise.
mertz,This is state of the art. You can have small or precise. Not both.
olbricht,Might this be just a little too small?
mertz,The explosion won't do the killing. The air in the room will.
olbricht,"Of course, I'm all for redundancy. However... If, by some miracle, Hitler does survive, what then?"
stauffenberg,We have an inside man at the Wolf's Lair in communications. He'll notify you immediately following the flash and then sever all contact with the outside world.
olbricht,Just how did you manage that?
stauffenberg,"It's my job, isn't it? While Hitler's inner circle is still regrouping, you will initiate Valkyrie and seize control in Paris and Berlin. Even if Hitler survives, we'll have momentum."
mertz, But as   you said yourself it would take a   miracle. Anyone in that bunker   when just one of these goes off is   not coming out alive.
olbricht,Himmler is expected to be at the meeting as well. Don't proceed unless you can get them both.
stauffenberg,That could be difficult.
olbricht,Why kill a madman just to have a lunatic take his place?
stauffenberg,"This is Goerdeler's idea, isn't it?"
olbricht,"The members are in total agreement on this.  Stauffenberg chews on this, pissed. Then:  STAUFFENBERG Fucking politicians. I'll hold off if the decision is unanimous. And I want another man on the committee. A soldier.  A soldier himself, Olbricht is insulted.  OLBRICHT And just who this soldier be?  Stauffenberg glances at Mertz, sizing him, up.  STAUFFENBERG  This is General Olbricht. Order the Guard Battalion and all Army Schools near Berlin to take up march readiness. Stand by for Operation Valkyrie.  CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK..."
helm, Lieutenant.
haans,What about it?
helm,This order is calling the Reserve Army for some sort of stand-by action... in Berlin.
haans, Looks like a drill of some kind.
helm,Valkyrie? I've never heard of that.
haans,"Send the order through, Sergeant."
haeften, Your man?
stauffenberg, Himmler. Where is Himmler?
keitel,"...Now for the first order of business. Fromm, I believe you will brief us on blocking divisions for the Eastern Front..."
mertz,General Olbricht's Office.  Stauffenberg says Himmler's not at the briefing. He wants to proceed.
olbricht,Call Beck.
beck,Beck.
stauffenberg,What do you say?
mertz,I say do it.
stauffenberg, My briefcase.
keitel,...Gentleman. You are dismissed.
fromm,That call better have been important.
freyend,Your bag... Colonel.
hase, What the hell is going on? My men have been standing here for an hour. I don't know what to tell them.
olbricht,This has been a drill. You're all to be commended for your quick response. Dismissed.
soldiers,HEIL HITLER.
hagen,What did I tell you? A drill.
olbricht,That man there. Who is he?
hase,Major Remer? He commands the Deutschland Guard Battalion. What about him?
olbricht,Get rid of him.
hase,Remer? Don't worry about him. He's an order taker. To the bone.
herber,The General will see you now.
fromm,How dare you put the Reserve Army on standby without my knowledge. You damn near cost me my commission. What in God's name made you think you even had the authority?
olbricht,It was only a drill. An exercise.
fromm,"DON'T LIE, OLBRICHT. Not to me. We both know it was no fucking drill."
stauffenberg,"General, if I may-"
fromm,"You may not, Colonel. You may not do anything. Because now you've not only shown me you can't deliver, you've painted a target on my back. If I so much as sense you trying to move the Reserve Army again, I'll personally have you both arrested. Do I make myself abundantly clear?"
fromm,Heil Hitler.
olbricht,Heil Hitler.
fromm,"I'll hear you say it, Colonel."
stauffenberg,HEIL HITLER.
goerdeler,"The point of your central solution is to replace Hitler so that we can negotiate a truce with the Allies. The Allies, I suspect, would be more amenable to a truce... IF WE OFFER IT TO THEM BEFORE THEY ARE IN FUCKING BERLIN."
stauffenberg,Today was a matter of indecision - nothing more. A military operation in the hands of a politician.
goerdeler,I don't think I am alone when I say your judgement is in question.  I would like to take a vote.
beck,Carl.
goerdeler,I DEMAND THAT WE RELIEVE COLONEL STAUFFENBERG.
beck,"Carl, if I may have a word with you in private."
goerdeler,"If you have something to say, Ludwig, say it here. Say it now."
beck,Very well. There's no need to vote.
goerdeler,Wha... What are you saying?
beck,Fellgiebel informed me this evening... Himmler's issued an order for your arrest. You'll have to leave Germany. Tonight. When we've succeeded with the central solution you'll return as Chancellor. Until then-
goerdeler,"This is your doing, isn't it? ISN'T IT? You can't just get rid of me like this. I am the man Germany will follow. I'm... I..."
beck,"Disappear, Carl. Avoid contact with anyone."
olbricht,I can't issue Valkyrie again unless we follow through. If he fails to-
stauffenberg,I'll do my job. You just take Berlin.
beck,"Gentlemen, may I introduce Chief Helldorf. He's guaranteed the full support of the Berlin Police."
beck,"Gentlemen, this is the most important day of your lives. Long live sacred Germany."
mertz,Put the Reserve Army on standby alert.
olbricht,Not until I hear from Stauffenberg. Not until I'm sure.
mertz,But that's not what he-
olbricht,"Noted, Colonel. Thank you."
freyend,"Gentlemen, may I present Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg - Chief Officer of the Reserve Army."
stauffenberg,Indeed. I've got the whole bag of tricks right here.
freyend,Let me take that for you.
stauffenberg,"Yes, sir, there is. I'm expecting a call of the utmost importance. Even if it comes when I am in conference with the Fhrer I'd appreciate it if you had a man come and get me."
fellgiebel,"Of course, Colonel."
keitel,Gentlemen. The meeting has been pushed forward to 12:30. Mussolini is arriving on the afternoon train and Hitler wants to have lunch with him.
stauffenberg,Will Mussolini be in the briefing?
keitel,I only wish he were. Then some ambitious officer might take the opportunity to shoot the dago bastard.
stauffenberg,I'll need a place to wash up - change my shirt.
freyend,"Please, do be quick. You heard the General."
haeften, You're arming them... now?
stauffenberg,No room for error this time. Assume I have ten minutes in this heat.
haeften,Leaving just three minutes to place the bomb.
stauffenberg,Plenty of time.
haeften,If the bomb goes off in ten.
freyend,"Major Freyend speaking.  Stauffenberg? Yes, he's arrived... They are on their way now."
stauffenberg,"Dammit man, what is it?"
freyend,General Keitel insists that the Colonel please hurry.
haeften,"The Colonel is changing, Major. You understand this can be difficult."
stauffenberg, See that the car is ready.
haeften,But sir-
stauffenberg,"I have everything I need, Lieutenant. Thank you."
freyend,Please. Let me help you with that.
stauffenberg," I can manage, thank you."
stauffenberg,Where are they going?
freyend,It's too hot. The briefing has been moved to the conference hut.
stauffenberg,My injuries left me a bit hard of hearing. See that you place me as near the Fhrer as possible.
general,The Eastern Front forces are assured a victory... but they need reinforcements.
keitel,Please pardon our tardiness... You remember Colonel Stauffenberg?
general,"As you can see, Mein Fhrer, the situation in the East Prussian sector is increasingly critical... "
adam,"General Fellgiebel, sir. He says it's urgent."
general,...And now I believe Colonel Stauffenberg will present us with his deployment for the Replacement Army should the unthinkable occur and the Russians reach-
freyend,Where the hell is Stauffenberg?
stauffenberg,Contact General Olbricht in Berlin. Tell him Hitler is dead. Proceed with Operation Valkyrie. Then sever all communications.
communications officer,What the hell just happened?
fellgiebel,What does it look like? The Fhrer is-
stauffenberg,We have to get to the airfield at once. Orders form the Fhrer.
fellgiebel,Sever all communications.
communications officer,Sir?
fellgiebel,"DON'T ARGUE WITH ME, DAMMIT. JUST DO IT."
mertz,I didn't hear you. Come again. Fellgiebel. FELLGIEBEL.
olbricht,"Well, what did he say?"
mertz,I... couldn't be sure. It sounded as though he said... Hitler is still alive.
olbricht,Get him back on the line.
mertz,Sir... The bomb did go off. That much was clear. Fellgiebel's next step will be to sever all communications.
olbricht,Only Fromm can initiate. You know that.
mertz,Then lie. Tell him Hitler's dead. Or arrest him. But do it now.
olbricht,I'm not doing anything until I talk to Fellgiebel. Get him back on the phone. NOW.
kolbe,No one gets in or out.
stauffenberg,We're on orders from the Fhrer. We have to get to the airfield immediately. You will step aside.
kolbe,"I'm sorry, sir, but my orders are-"
stauffenberg,Get me General Keitel.
kolbe,Kolbe.
stauffenberg,Sergeant Kolbe says no one is getting out... Yes. Yes. Maybe you can explain it to him.
kolbe,"That won't be necessary, Colonel."
olbricht,I can't initiate Valkyrie without confirmation that Hitler's dead. It's too great a risk.
mertz,What about Stauffenberg? What about his risk? He did his part and now you're abandoning him.
olbricht,"Watch yourself, Colonel."
mertz,Shouldn't you be consulting Beck?
olbricht,I know just what Beck will say. He's a dying man. What does he have to lose?
mertz,At least put the Reserve Army on alert.
olbricht,"I can't cover up another false alarm. When Stauffenberg returns, when he gives me confirmation. Then we'll proceed."
mertz,And where are you going?
olbricht,The same place you are. Lunch.
adam,The one-eyed Colonel...
keitel,Stauffenberg.
adam,He left the building very abruptly - just before the explosion.
keitel,Several men left the building before the explosion.
adam,"Yes, sir. Of course. But..."
keitel,"But what? Spit it out, man."
adam,Well. The Colonel left his hat.
freyend,"Pardon the intrusion, sir, but I think you will be most interested to hear what this man has to say."
mertz,Orders from General Olbricht.
helm,Send it through. But keep me informed.
hagen,Here we go again.
stauffenberg,"Quiet, isn't it?"
haeften,I'll see where our driver is.
olbricht,Explain this.
mertz,Someone had to do something while you were playing dead.
olbricht,We don't know that the Fhrer is not alive. We don't know any-
mertz,"THIS IS ABOUT GERMANY, FOR GOD'S SAKE. NOT YOU. BE A MAN."
stauffenberg,"It's been three hours, Olbricht. What the hell have you been doing?"
olbricht,We've had no confirmation that-
stauffenberg,"Dammit man, I saw the explosion myself. Nothing else matters now. We are committed."
olbricht,Dear God.
stauffenberg,Now where is Fromm? Is he with us or did you-
olbricht,I- No one has spoken to him yet.
stauffenberg,"Listen to me, Olbricht. Never mind Germany. Never mind Europe. Your life is at stake now, do you understand? If you want to live through the night you'll do exactly as I say."
olbricht,I understand.
stauffenberg,"The second you hang up the phone, initiate Operation Valkyrie in Fromm's name. Then go over to his office in force, give him the choice to join us or place him under immediate arrest. Do I make myself perfectly clear?"
olbricht,I understand.
stauffenberg,I am at the airfield now. I will be in Fromm's office in fifteen minutes. Be there when I arrive.
olbricht,Get Beck and the others. Tell them it's time.
helm,The Fhrer is dead.
haans,You all know your jobs. Get to work.
operator,Sergeant. This order is signed by Witzleben.
helm, That's ridiculous. He`s not even in the army anymore.
olbricht,General Fellgiebel. At the Wolf's Lair.
olbricht,"There's no use calling, all communication lines are-"
keitel,I don't know what you mean. Everything's in order here.
fromm,There's talk the Fhrer's been assassinated.
keitel,"Another failed attempt. The Fhrer was never in danger.  By the way, where is your man Colonel Stauffenberg?"
fromm,"Stauffenberg? On his way back to Berlin, I should think."
fromm,Certainly.
stauffenberg,Hitler is dead. Operation Valkyrie is in effect.
fromm,OPERATION VAL- WHO GAVE THE ORDER?
stauffenberg,You did.
fromm,THIS IS NOTHING LESS THAN TREASON.
stauffenberg,"Be that as it may, the Reserve Army is assuming control here in Berlin. We trust you'll join us."
fromm,"Dammit, man. Do you realize what you've done? The Fhrer is a-"
stauffenberg,I delivered the bomb myself. I saw the blast. He is dead.
fromm,This can't be happening. It's some kind of joke.
stauffenberg,Are you with us or not?
fromm,"Colonel, if what you say is true you should shoot yourself at once.  The rest of you are under arrest."
stauffenberg,"No, General. You are."
stauffenberg, Lock him upstairs in his private quarters. Make sure his phone lines are cut.
stauffenberg,You're not in uniform.
beck,This has to be seen as a movement of the people.
young officer,"Colonel Stauffenberg, sir. We're reporting for duty."
stauffenberg," Helldorf, I'm... glad to see you. We're getting a late start and we need all of the manpower we can muster. Can we count on the police?"
helldorf,There's a lot of talk that Hitler isn't really dead. Is this true?
stauffenberg,I can't offer you any guarantees. The decision is yours and yours alone. Can we count on you?
helldorf,I'm with you.
stauffenberg,Have your men surround the building. No one gets in or out of here without my permission.  I want every available soldier on task - we need simultaneous control of every government building in the city. Dismissed.
beck,Acts of vengeance will not be tolerated. We represent a different form of government. We represent what is good and just in Germany.
stauffenberg,"...Deploy troops to seize and protect all Reich agencies. Of most importance are communication centers - newspapers, radio stations, telephone and telegraph offices. All Nazi officials and government leaders are to be arrested at once..."
hase,"... Completely blockade the government quarters. Everything from the Brandenburg Gate to Potsdamer Platz. Nobody, not even generals or ministers, should be allowed to pass.  You have your orders, gentlemen."
remer,"It just all seems very... vague, sir. Protocol dictates we should receive orders in writing-"
hase,"These are the orders as they were presented to me, Major. Now move."
hagen,Major Remer. We've just had orders from the War Ministry. The battalion is to blockade the government quarter and place Minister Goebbels under arrest.
remer,Something just doesn't feel right about this. I would hate to find out I'm being taken advantage of.
hagen, A coup you think?
remer,Of that I am certain. What I can't say is which side we're on. Get in.
fat general,"Begging your pardon, but I have orders to report to General Fromm."
olbricht,General Fromm is no longer in command. I am.
fat general,I...  Beck? What are you- What is going on here?
stauffenberg,The Fhrer is dead. The SS is staging a coup. We've initiated Operation Valkyrie to crush the uprising and save Hitler's Germany.
fat general,"I'd say there is a coup all right, but it's not the SS."
olbricht,You will present these orders to your troops.
fat general,I will do no such thing without speaking to General Fromm. I swore an oath-
fat general,This is treason. I won't take part. The Fhrer is not dead. THE FHRER IS NOT DEAD.  The Fat General makes a break for it. The conspirators chase him out into...
olbricht,STOP THAT MAN.
fat general,THE FHRER IS NOT DEAD. I'VE SWORN AN OATH. YOU ALL HAVE...
stauffenberg,Lt. Herber. Come here.
goebbels,I am ready to be connected.
remer,"Minister Goebbels, my battalion has an order to blockade the government quarter and place you under arrest."
goebbels,"Are you a dedicated Nazi, Major?"
remer,"Yes, sir."
remer,"Of course, Mein Fhrer."
haans,"What is it now, Sergeant?"
helm,"It's just that now we're getting conflicting orders, sir. The Wolf's Lair says one thing, Stauffenberg another."
haans,Our job is not to interpret the orders. Our job is to pass them along. Regardless.
helm,"Yes, but sir-"
haans,"Is that perfectly clear, Sergeant?"
remer, Release these men at once.
hagen,But these men are part of a coup.
remer,"I've just been on the phone with Hitler himself. We are the coup, you idiot. We've been duped."
fromm,"Well, Lieutenant. What do you make of all of this?"
herber,I... I don't know...
fromm,I won't ask you to make a choice. That's for you and you alone. All I ask is that you observe and think for yourself. In time you'll see things for what they truly are. You know where to find me when you do.
herber,Heil Hitler.
goebbels,Have you seen the Fhrer? Is he-
himmler,It seems the conference table shielded him from the blast. He's lucky to be alive.  Do you want to tell me what's going on?
goebbels,Everything is under control. I've taken charge of the Guard Battalion and given them new orders. We're turning the tables on these cowards.
himmler,I've been sent here personally by the Fhrer to collect the conspirators. He insists they be taken alive.
goebbels,Take this down. By order of Adolf Hitler...
helm,"It's a coup all right... And when it's over, we'd better wind up on the right side. Now we can't afford to remain neutral any longer. We have to make a decision."
haans,Very well. Send all communications from the Wolf's Lair. Stop all communications from Stauffenberg.
radio announcer,...The Fhrer himself suffered no major injuries and resumed his work immediately...
stauffenberg,Send the following teleprint to all Army Commanders... `Broadcast communique not correct. The Fhrer is dead. Orders to be carried out with utmost dispatch.'
witzleben,The military districts are receiving contradictory reports. I've got men sitting around joking about whose turn it is to arrest whom. Neither the capital nor the radio network are under our control. And where are the troops? You'd think there would be some activity going on in this city.  The word is all over the street that Hitler is still alive. We trusted you and you failed us. You should have stayed. To be sure.
witzleben,I'm going home to await my inevitable arrest.
herber,Arm yourselves.
remer,YOU THERE.
remer,You're under arrest.
beck,"I'd like a pistol, please."
remer,"General, my orders are to deliver the prisoners alive."
fromm,"Noted, Major.  Get on with it then."
remer,"But, sir-"
fromm,"THAT WILL BE ALL, MAJOR."
beck,I'm thinking of earlier times...
