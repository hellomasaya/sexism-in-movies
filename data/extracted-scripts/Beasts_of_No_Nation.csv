agu,I...
father,I?   I. I. I. what?
agu,I got them from the Nigerians.

big brother,We are seeing that witch woman on the road today. She is saying we are thieves. Why is she saying that?
father,"She is not right in her head. God has taken away her ration. The land we are letting the refugees use has been in our family since before your Grandfather, we gave her a place in the camp but she refused."
agu,So she's crazy?

agu,Enh?
father,What is this?

mother,Sometimes I am thinking that you are having no sense at all.
father,"What is so irrational about staying with your sister in the Capital, I will be coming to meet you once I am knowing everything is safe here. I cannot just be abandoning my responsibilities."
mother,But then you are abandoning us.
father,"Just remove that thought from you head. What are we just supposed to be doing, then? Enh? Just running into the bush and living like rats?"
mother,"No, you are not understanding anything. "
father,I am not asking you. I am telling you woman.

driver,And the little boy?
agu," I am not a ""little"" boy."
father,"Him, too."

father,I am thinking this women and children are more valuable than all this luggage you have piled in back.
father,With the boy-
mother,We will find another way.

man, Shut up!
man #2, If they are finding us...
man #3," They will drive our body into the bush, just leaving us for animal to be eating."
father," Do not be listening to them, Agu. No matter what happens, this is how God tests us, we must be strong."
man #2, I am rather to be outside than to just be dying like animal inside!
father,"We stay here, outside we die."
man #2,We must go!
father,You are killing us all!
man #3,"If you are running fast, then the soldier won't be seeing you."

two-i-c,This thing? It is just a boy.
commandant,A boy.
ndf sbu,"Harmless no, sah!"
commandant,Does a boy not have eyes to see?
ndf sbu,"Two eyes, sah!"
commandant,A boy has hands to strangle!
two-i-c,Sah? We need to be move-
commandant,I said wait.  You are from Alpha Town?
agu,"My father is telling me to run. Run far far so the Army Soldier is not catching me and killing me. And then, and then I am just hiding in the bush and running running..."
commandant,And where is this your father?
agu, Agu.
commandant,Say it like you are proud of it.
agu,Agu.
commandant,"Agu, enh? Well, that is what I will be calling you then."
two-i-c,Formation!

agu,Yes.
commandant,"Say yes, sah."
agu,"Yes, sah."
commandant,Move on!

agu,I carried ammunition and water all day.
chicken legs,You think you are a soldier now?
ndf cook,Stealing from a dog?
agu,Which one of you is the dog?
preacher,The man who is driving the enemy to madness...
griot,He is treating death like lover.
hope,He is eating people.
commandant,"I am not eating people, Hope-"
commandant,Native Defense Forces!
ndf soldiers,"Strong, proud, and intelligent!"
two-i-c,How does the Commandant look?!
ndf soldiers,Alright!
two-i-c,...weakened by the PLF's outside pressure. The National Reformation Council took advantage of this instability and militarily seized power to restore UPC dominance. We NDF refuse to recognize this illegitimate government.
commandant,"You are knowing what that is meaning. Mosquitoes, sickness, muddy squalor. Suffering if we are caught with our ""soldiers"" hanging out."
two-i-c,...the Junta will tell the international community that we NDF are the reason this war continues.
commandant,"You, Hope, and you, Rambo, you are not from the same tribe as him.  But you are brothers before your enemy."
hope,"No, sah."
commandant,War?
rambo,"Yes, Sah!"
two-i-c,"The PLF could join the NRC, it would legitimize their cause, make us the sole enemy, and give them freedom to roam formerly Government controlled areas of the nation in policing actions. If this were..."
commandant,"We have defended ourselves against criminal rapings and killings of our own people, first by the PLF, and now by the NRC government."
two-i-c,"You see, the colonists have never left Africa. Our very own politicians will steal our resources and give them away for pennies in exchange for private payoffs...but..."
commandant,"They are licking their wounds. They are feeling our sting. We, along with our other brothers fighting further south under Dada Goodblood, we command and control what the NRC needs."
two-i-c,"The Grass People in the South East control the lumber and gold, the Clay and Charcoal people in the South West, diamonds and rare metals, and the Coastal people, petroleum and fisheries. This is the reason the NRC are trying so hard to be calling themselves a ""reformation council."""
commandant,Reformation of what? Money. Old men and money.
two-i-c,They have spit on the constitution. They have spit on your rights. They have tried to spit on your future.
commandant,"War has spoiled their minds, Gentlemen. So they could have ""their turn to eat."
commandant,War is a disease. It sickens and infects.
two-i-c,The richness of our nation is for the young.
commandant,"When there is an infection in your foot. A deadly deathly sickness in your limb that's going to kill you slow slow, what do you do?"
chief priest, You must die before you are reborn.
two-i-c,"Tomorrow we mobilize for major action, uniting all of our brother warriors under Supreme Commander Dada Goodblood, and with God's blessing, end this plague, end this war, end our oppression!"
commandant,"Young men! Gentlemen! We will not wait to inherit it, we will not wait for them to just give it to us, we will take it, we will seize it from their rotting and decaying old hands."
chief priest,"Eat the enemy if you bring him down. Become braver, his heart becomes your medicine."
commandant,"The spirits have blessed you and cleansed you. To the enemy, you are invincible. But there are rules you must follow to keep the spirits happy, to remain pure."
chief priest,No sex with women. No touching women. No talking to women. Stay pure. No looting. No touching dead bodies. No...
commandant,"Agu, you are a soldier now. The only way is forward. Do not be leaving any nice thing for the NRC or the PLF to be using if they are coming to this place."
chicken legs,Advancing in the rainy season?
griot,Everyone will be on zero-zero-one now.
agu,What is zero-zero-one?
preacher,"It is meaning you, me, we all be hungry."
griot,"It means no breakfast, no lunch, only dinner. If you are wanting to eat when it is not dinner, then you are having to keep your dinner from before to be eating the next day."
hope,"Or if we raiding or finding farm, then we can be eating what we find. Cow, chicken, baby... woman."
commandant,"It is even having a root like a cassava, but if you eat it, it will kill you with its poison."
agu,"Yes, sah."
commandant," You will destroy anything that threatens us. As I would anything that threatens you, understand?"
hope,"Don't worry, killing is easy."
chicken legs,"Besides, you already eating a man."
agu,What do you mean?
chicken legs,"What do you think was that ball of garri, the one you are eating in initiation?"
agu,They are calling you Strika?
griot, Morale booster.
hope," It is good juju, making you stronger and braver."
agu, And eating pencil.
hope,Shhh. They are coming.
army corporal,Please do not shoot us!
preacher,"Agu, where is the fucking ammunition?"
army corporal,"Please, Sah. I am an engineering student from the university in the capital. I am supposed to be fixing bridges, not be a soldier."
hope,Sah!
commandant,Open it.
griot,What is it?
commandant,"No, no, this won't do."
aide,A pistol?
two-i-c,Why not the cutlass?
cso,Does he have the strength?
commandant,"Rambo, seize him, hold his ass to the ground."
commandant,Always keep it with you.
two-i-c,"If you are losing it, then I will be losing you."
commandant,You are my Special Guards now.  Both of you.
cso,Suh.
commandant,Agu and Strika are now my Special Guards.
cso,"Yes, suh. Special Guards."
commandant,Gentlemen! Cover! Cover!
two-i-c,Cover!
agu,"Botu, botu, botu."
commandant,"...ooh, and they are having so many foods to be eating..."
two-i-c,"Commandant, sir!"
commandant,Who is this?
two-i-c,"Refugees, sir. They say the PLF and the NRC took their village three days ago. They killed most, but let these ones go."
commandant,"Well, let us be giving their village back, huh?"
hope, See what the PLF does to you?
commandant, Two-I-C?
commandant,Report.
two-i-c,"We are facing heavy fire, suh."
commandant,Can you take the bridge?
two-i-c,"I don't know, suh."
commandant,Explain.
two-i-c,"It's very difficult, suh. Our     men are fighting bravely but-"
commandant,"But nothing. Take the bridge, that is your task."
two-i-c,"We need support, suh. The men's spirts are low, suh."
commandant,"Agu, Strika, come here. Look at this."
commandant,These bullets?
agu,To always be leaving it off.
commandant,Off. How will you be firing quickly if it is in safety? Enh? Listen.
agu,What?
commandant, Sit.
agu,"Thank you, sah."
commandant,You see what happens when the men listen to me?
agu,"Yes, sah."
commandant,You are wanting to know how to be leading?
agu,"No, sah. I am happying to be following you, sah."
commandant,"That is good, Agu, because there is no learning to be leading. Some men is born to leading, other is born to following, and other is only waiting to be dying."
agu,"I am following you, sah."
commandant,"No, Agu. You are different. You are reminding me of me when I was a little boy, and this means you are borning to be leader. But even the best leader Agu, must first be learning to be good follower. Sometimes I even have to be following the Supreme Commander, if when I am not agreeing."
agu,"Yes, sah. I am a good follower, sah."
commandant,You are seeing this place. Supreme Commander is saying this is important. So it is important for me then.
agu,"I am thinking she is in the Capital, sah."
commandant,"After Goodblood greets us, we all will be going to the Capital, that is a certainty."
agu," Yes, sah."
commandant,Then be saying it.
agu,"I can be keeping this secret, sah."
commandant,"In this family where I am being father, we cannot have the other children getting jealous, Agu!"
commandant,"This is the nature of the place we are going. The homeland of the collaborators and traitors. Our people's blood has flowed for year. Now must their blood flow, too. Let us pray to the spirits and God."
voices whisper,Devil be blessing you. Devil bless what you do.
preacher,This way...
agu,What is wrong with them?
agu,What is wrong with them? Why are they crying?
preacher,Commandant won't let them go with him into battle.
agu,Where is this battle?
agu,Mother?
woman,"God, please take my daughter safely to heaven. Please Lord I am begging to You."
agu,Devil is not blessing me. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
commandant,"See, now it is your time to eat."
cso,"This is for you, sah."
two-i-c,From the Supreme Commander?   What does it say?
commandant,He is summoning us.
cso,Where do I instruct the drivers to take us?
commandant,To Taro -- The Town of Abundant Resources.
two-i-c,Did he state the reason?
commandant,No.
preacher,"Pardon me, sah."
commandant,What is happening to this one?
two-i-c,A piece of his own RPG is hitting his temple.
preacher,What do we do with them?
commandant,"Leave one living. Tell him to run north, to the next village, and to the next village after that, tell him to tell everyone that soon we come. This is just the beginning."
commandant,"Home, Agu."
preacher,Friend!
preacher,We are NDF. 
commandant,I am.
agu,These people do not run.
deputy,Commandant. Welcome.
commandant,Thank you Deputy.
deputy,We apologize for the inconvenience. We do not want to alarm the population by the arrival of such a large force.
commandant,When can they enter? I have-
deputy,"I do not know Goodblood's plan for you. I assure you, you will know A- S-A-P."
commandant,You will bring something to drink for us. Water.
deputy,Certainly.
deputy,"Supreme Commander is so very upset to keep you waiting. Please, follow me."
commandant,What is this? This is just another room. Where is our water?
agu,"Give us water! Give us water, now!"
deputy,Commandant.
commandant,Where are you putting us to be sleeping?
deputy,"I hope this room, with the air conditioning, will be sufficient. Thank you, Gentlemen."
deputy,"Commandant, I trust you rested well. I would like you to know we also offered rations and water to the rest of your Battalion this morning."
two-i-c,"Thank you, Deputy."
goodblood,At ease Gentlemen. At ease...
commandant,"Supreme Commander, sah."
goodblood,"I must apologize for yesterday, so much busy-ness these days, it's worn me down."
commandant,"I'm sorry you were feeling weak, sah."
goodblood,I see your family has grown.
commandant,"I am hungry. Two-I-C, bring me a plate."
goodblood,"Two-I-C, you stay. Deputy?"
commandant,"What is this, Chief? Why are you making me wait?"
goodblood,It is your duty.
commandant,"Something has changed, what is it?"
goodblood,"Protecting our people remains the priority. As you know, the world is becoming aware of this war, now. No one will escape judgment when it is over."
commandant,"Chief, to protect our people, we have the force and the momentum, why stop, why wait?"
goodblood,"It used to be survival of the strongest, the strong dominating by brute force, but now it is survival of the wittiest and the decisions we make have far deeper consequences."
commandant,Then what is your plan for my battalion? Are you not making me General?
goodblood,"I am not. I am giving your battalion to Two-I-C, Commandant. That is why I brought you here."
two-i-c,I promise to perform my duties to the fullest pot-
commandant,Two-I-C get out.
goodblood,"I want the ceremony of change over tomorrow, so that Two-I-C... I mean newly, Commandant in absence, may take the battalion back out for security details. As you know, and much thanks to you, we have the NRC on their heels. With support from the UN and ECOMOD, the battle now is for public image. Two-I-C and other commanders like him will provide that for us until the junta crumbles."
commandant,You are taking my battalion?
goodblood,"Commandant, your battalion is my battalion. One of hundreds across the nation. I will remind you that you are a soldier, you are subject to orders, you listen and obey orders."
commandant,"And for my services, Chief? I built this battalion. I am their father."
goodblood,That honor remains yours.
commandant,"And payment? What share of the resources will I have, for this honor?"
goodblood,"If you are wanting to be a man of industry and resources, then find a job with a mining company. I am offering you something else entirely, an education."
commandant,"I have not Chief. I am not a politician, I am a soldier."
tripod,Move on!
tripod,Sah?!
commandant,"Assemble the C/Os, take the troops and bivouac outside of town. I am taking Two-I-C with some of the boys to celebrate."
tripod,"Yes, suh!"
two-i-c,Where are we going?
commandant,You will see. You will like it.
madame,"Enh, so you come?"
commandant,Ma. Bring something that will satisfy my soldiers and my soldier!
madame,"Get up you, can't you see we are having guest?"
young girl,The beer is warm.
commandant,How is it warm?
young girl,No ice.
commandant,No ice!?
young girl,No light.
commandant,Bring the drink. We will be drinking it even if it is warm.
two-i-c,Commandant. Permission to be dismissed. I want to be going to be checking on my men-
commandant,"Negative. You'll be staying here so we can celebrate you. In fact, Mama, why don't you bring a special one for my Two-I-C, who will soon be the Co-mman-dan-tttt.  Who's your Commandant?"
tripod,"You, sir!"
commandant,But you have one special for Two-I- C?
madame,No problem. No problem.
commandant,"Hey Mama, this one's fresh papaya."
madame,"If it is woman you are wanting, leave this one. I am having plenty womens in the back if you are having plenty moneys to be giving me, for a special girl."
commandant,"Don't you be worrying about money, ma. Bring me a good girl, you know my specifications."
agu,"Auntie! Auntie, bring us some chips!"
madame,"This small thing borned yesterday trying to order things around, enh!"
commandant,What is happening? Huh? What happened?
two-i-c, You did this.
commandant,What happened to my man? Wh- What happened here?
girl,"I was just playing with his gun, and it just went off. I don't know what happened. I don't know- I'm sorry."
two-i-c, You did this. You did this.
commandant, You did this! You did this!
girl,She told me...
madame,She told you? It was an accident!
commandant,Go!
two-i-c,You are just a boy.
commandant,Agu? Is that you.
tripod,Goodblood is asking for you.
commandant,"Sometimes Agu, sometimes I am feeling sorry for you."
agu,Two-I-C is dead.
commandant,You are my new Two-I-C.
commandant,This was not God's work. This was man's. The Supreme Commander was our friend. Now he is our enemy. But we are not fearing change... for we are strong!
men,Strong and proud!
commandant,That is why we should be taking our own territory and filling our own pockets. Move out.
preacher,"Tripod, Hope!"
agu, Strika? Strika! We are having to go or they will be leaving us.
agu,"Enh... Strika, a song. Music. Like my mother sings..."
preacher,"Ammo. Find me some fucking bullets to be shooting, Agu."
agu,He is dead.
preacher,Who is dead?
agu,Him.
agu,"Commandant, suh. We are out of bullets."
commandant,"Kai! This fog, Agu. It is our friend."
agu,They are dead.
commandant,Who are dead?
commandant,What is all this noise?
preacher,"We are leaving, sah."
commandant,Who and who is leaving?
preacher,"No, Sah. We are going."
commandant,You are the only one stupid standing in front of me.
preacher,"I am going, sah! I have no bullets, I cannot be shooting our enemy with no bullets. There is no gold, no money, nothing to be buying more bullets. So I am going."
commandant,"I see. I see you are a big man now, Two-I-C. And where will you be going? You will surrender to the other NDF? No. They will eat you. And to the ECOMOD? That would be wiser, but, then what? Jail? War crimes? If they let you go, you think you will ever have it as good as you have it right now in this mud? You think that you will be able to just do what you want in ""peace""?"
father friday,"Turn to God. Confession and Forgiveness and Resurrection, these are the things you need to know to bring the life back to your life..."
preacher,They are not even paying us an allowance. How are we supposed to be living on this?
agu,Don't go Preacher.
agu,"Yes, I am having Bible, but I am using to be holding my drawing down on my desk so the fan is not throwing them everywhere."
preacher,"They are saying they are needing soldier, fighting is what I am knowing and that is what I should be doing. You are sure you do not want to fight?"
amy,"Go on, try, try to talk about it..."
amy,"Tell me what you are feeling, or, try to tell me what you are thinking."
agu,I am thinking about my future.
amy,"Good, yes, good. And how do you see your future?"
agu,Botu botu botu.
amy,Do you want to talk about some of your experiences?
agu,I am seeing more terrible thing than ten thousand men and I am doing more terrible thing than twenty thousand men.
