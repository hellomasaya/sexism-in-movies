Speaker,Dialogue
junior stemmons,We should make our move now.
me,Mid-fight? Look at the crowd: you wanna be at the center of a riot?
junior stemmons,I don't wanna be here when Noonan and the Feds show up.
me,"We let Sanderline finish this beating, we get his gratitude.                          *"
junior stemmons,We gonna let Rock-a-bye fight too-
me,-relax Junior.
me,"Sanderline, I'm Lieutenant Klein of the LAPD and a real big fan-"
junior stemmons,-you're under arrest.
me,No you're not. Reuben is-
reuben ruiz,-Lieutenant Dave why you arrest-
me,-for being a ranked fighter who still steals hubcaps. Shut up.  Reuben's in custody. But you could be our Guest. Whaddya say?
ring announcer,"Ladies and Gentleman...due to circumstances beyond our control, Rock-A-Bye Ruiz will not fight this-"
junior stemmons,C'MON-JESUS-HE'S RIGHT THERE!
me,Then you can stop pointing at him.
me,Hungry Sanderline?
sanderline johnson,If they got shrimp.
me, You want something Reuben?
reuben ruiz,To know why the fuck I'm here-
junior stemmons,"-mind your tone, Shitbird..."
reuben ruiz,Shitbird went out with Vaudeville. You get your badge in a cereal box?
me,You're here because we want you to remember where you live.
sanderline, City of Angels.
me,Excellent Sanderline.
reuben ruiz,What?
me,"You live in LA, Asshole. You do not live in `Federal Government.'"
junior stemmons,We get to spend time alone now.
reuben ruiz,Want some perfume?
me,Stop laughing.
sanderline johnson,-but they don't know...
me, And they don't have to. Now tell me what you were gonna tell Noonan-
sanderline,Bet you they ran outta shrimp.
me,Yeah.
me,-who's `we?'
me,Tell Sam if I get minute-
unidentified voice,"-yer gonna have to make a minute for him. Now. See, we think the Spade might testify that Sam owns him and how we was grooming him for a title shot he was gonna tank. A fight everybody woulda' got flush off of, including the Spade.                        *  Have him look out the window Klein."
me,"Sanderline, you gotta see this..."
sanderline johnson,What'm I-
me,DID THAT MUTT JUST JUMP?
bradley,Turn it off.
me,I was pissing. He was jumping.
bradley,"`US Attorney Noonan is accusing the Los Angeles Police Department in general, and Lt. David Klein in particular, of murder at worst, gross incompetence at best...'"
me,Noonan had Sanderline scared. After he sang to me he panicked & jumped.
tom bethune,He did spend a month in Camarillo Mental Hospital last year-
tom bethune,"Plus, Reuben Ruiz recanted. So Noonan's Boxing Probe is dead. He's got nothing-"
bradley,"-but time, a mandate and new targets...I need to speak to the Lieutenant alone."
me,"Take both men into custody before Noonan and the Feds could, and find                   * out what they were going to tell-"
bradley,-and why did I choose you for this?
me,"Because I'm a Cop with a law degree, and you thought my legal-"
bradley,"-because your a thug with a law degree. Because I thought by now you'd be so indebted to this Department for not indicting and/or                   * imprisoning you, that diligent, honest discharge of duty would be assured.  And I made a horrible misjudgment.                    *"
me,Bethune and Gallaudet don't think so.
bradley,"Bob's happy because he wants to be State Attorney General and his most likely opponent will be Welles Noonan. Tom's happy because Morton Diskant, who's leading their City Council race, is endorsed by Noonan. Thus, they're not seeing the larger play.  Noonan's new target will likely be the LAPD itself."
me,How do you know that?
bradley,Because that's where I would aim: a subpoenaed Federal witness plummets to his death in the company of two LAPD detectives?  This screams Police Corruption.                      * This offers Noonan the possibility of payback in the form of national headlines.
me,Johnson did that stint at the Nut House -- leak his file to your friends at the times-
bradley,My friends would be more interested in this.  It shocks and sickens me that your allegiance to the Chicago mob would take precedence over the LAPD.
me, Gun? Shield? What?
bradley,"The appearance of disciplinary measures taken against you are mandated post-Sanderline Johnson,                    * so your suspension will be recorded but sealed...and kept quiet for now-                 *"
me,So if the papers or Noonan come sniffing around-
bradley,-we can provide adequate proof of your dismissal.
me,But you're not dismissing me.
bradley,"Just on paper.  Since I misjudged the Cop I thought you were, I'm going to leverage the Cop that you are."
me, You want me to torpedo Diskant so your buddy Bethune can win a City                      * Council seat uncontested-
bradley,-or spend the next month in lock-up                    * before being arraigned on charges                      * of gross misconduct and dereliction                    * of duty. The preamble before you                       * face life in prison for murder.                        *
meg, I already got the Times inside.
meg,How much is true?
me,How many times have I lied to you?
meg,Zero.
me,You've always liked your Men mean.
me,What would Mom and Dad say?
me,Nothing. That's where I learned it.
meg,Poor you.
me,"Yeah, pour me...a cup please. Black, no sugar."
meg,It's work.
me,How's Pete?
meg,"More work.  Quiet while we wait for the pot...and quiet always means creeping sleep: an Enemy I never stop fighting. Force my eyes open, shift in my seat: I've been exhausted for years.  I drift despite my best efforts and for a split second you see the Hell I see when sleep wins:"
pete, You look like Death taking a shit.
meg,He's still got that MGM-face.
pete,You're still the only guy who ever traded movie-potential for Police work.
meg,Because in the movies they make you pull your punches.
me,Wanna do LAPD a favor tonight?
meg,No. We're going to the Cocoanut-
pete,'Favor' mean `free?'
me,Means $500 an hour.
meg,Gimme the phone so I can find another Date-
me,-you're the only Woman I know who calls Men-
meg,-you're the only Man I know who doesn't call Women.
pete,What are we doing?
junior stemmons,You got a birthday coming up.
me,What?
junior stemmons,"On the 16th, right? How old?"
me,Old. What are you writing?                          *
junior stemmons,Just notes...about work-
me,-what `work'?
junior stemmons,Mostly compare and contrast stuff. Street work versus textbook-
me,-chapter 1: don't write shit down. Chapter 2: or other Cops might kill                 * you.
junior stemmons,So you think Noonan will come after you for the Sanderline thing? He seems like a real hard charger.
me, I heard he was coming after both of us.
junior stemmons,What?
me,Indictments. Prison time. Whole nine.
junior stemmons,Holy Jesus. Is this true?
me,I'm seriously thinking about turning Junior...testifying against you.
junior stemmons,He should suck his dick. Y'know? Put the icing on it.
pete,What?
junior stemmons,Tell me that wouldn't sell it...plus he's a Communist.
me,"We're ruining his career, not his soul. Reload the camera."
morton diskant,Off me!
me,Drop out of the City Council race or I send these pictures to the papers.
morton diskant,I'll fight you rotten-
me,-and maybe salvage something that's a close cousin to `respect.' But what about your wife and kid getting hold of those pictures?
quiff,My name's Franklin-
me,-of course it is.
diskant,-don't say my name...
pete,He gets it.
me,Someone from the Times will call for a quote. Whatever your reason for dropping out make it real.
diskant, You eventually lose the ability to reconcile the things you've done to people. That's Hell.
pete, Y'know Hughes has a job you're tailor-made for. I already gave him your-
me,-no thanks.
pete,"Stop pretending you're not a pig for all this, Klein."
me,"I still got a day job, Pete-"
pete,-tossing more Bantamweights out                       * windows?
me,The Mutt jumped.
pete, C'mon -- it's a cake legal gig. He                    * just wants you to burn some actress that stopped fucking him.
me, ...yeah...Narco's Snitch.
me,So send Robbery.
me,Why me?
bradley,Call it penance.
me,I thought that's what Morton Diskant was-
bradley,-that makes one of us. 1284 South                         * Tremaine. 
me,Junior. Meet me at 1284 South                         * Tremaine. 20 minutes.
wilhite,Why are you here?
me,You smell like bourbon Wilhite-
wilhite,-fuck off. This is handled. And pull your idiot partner out of there-
me,-Junior's already here-
wilhite,"-Magdalena was my Snitch, so it's my scene."
me,"Then get Bradley on the horn, so you can relay that order. I'm here on his word. Now, what happened?"
wilhite, Guard dogs are dead. Magdalena's missing.
me,And presumed what?
wilhite,I could give a shit. I just want to this case to get a quick burial.
me,I'll bet. Who made the call?
wilhite,Some old broad heard an `argument' and buzzed Wilshire Station.                *
me,Where's the family?
wilhite,The wife and daughter were in Santa Barbara. Just got back.
me, At 2 AM?                                    *
wilhite,What do you think they were                 * fighting about? Santa Barbara Wasps         * don't fancy dope-pushing Wetbacks.
me,What about the Son?                         *
wilhite, Tommy. Make him your #1 suspect.
me,Why's that?                                 *
wilhite,He's got a mean streak. And he and          * Hector had been at each others throats for months. Have Tommy              * picked up. He likes to loaf at              * those nigger jazz joints in Watts.          *
me,"Alright, you better cut out before                      * people start asking why the head of Narco is at a missing persons."
wilhite,Get a conviction. Grab Tommy and pin this thing fast or you'll have a whole division of disgraced cops at your front door.
me,What are you talking about Wilhite?
wilhite,You queered the Fed's   Fight Probe by killing that boxer   and they already had a hard-on   for the LAPD-                   * Bradley sent you down   here as damaged goods...think   about it. Everybody sees what's   coming.  Now close this quick.
biddie, -shifty...colored...y'know Negros are planning an invasion! After our white women and our water supply-
officer,-where was this Peeper you saw?
biddie,Bushes. Spyin' on Lucille. Seen him                   * there before! He's a black saboteur                   * looking for fertile white wombs. Wanna breed a mulatto master race-                    *
me,Officer.
officer,"Heard an argument, loud, maybe a minute or two, then silence."
me,What's this `Peeper' riff she's on?
officer,"She saw someone in the bushes earlier. She's reported that kind of thing a dozen other times. She's also reported flying saucers, so..."
me,See if any of the other Neighbors can verify this `Peeper' thing.                       *
junior stemmons,No one touch a thing `til I say.
me,-Lieutenant Klein. I said `meet me' in twenty minutes' not `go in without me.'
junior stemmons,All I've been doing-
me," -is stepping on dicks. You don't know the history, the players or the play."
junior stemmons,-what Department?
me,Us Pollyanna -- LAPD. We bullet- proofed him in exchange for 60% of his profit and a promise he only deal drugs in Darktown and East LA-                  *
junior stemmons,-Black and Mexican-
me,-give the man a prize. He'd also                     * rat his competition and kill the ones we couldn't convict. Now keep your mouth shut and stay on my hip.
me,-are all the Magdalena vehicles accounted for?
junior stemmons,Except for the Son's: Tommy.                         *
me,OFFICER.
officer,"No, I asked. Just the yelling."
me,She didn't hear barking...so they were either lousy guard dogs...or they knew the Killer.  Like when you shoot something with a silencer.
junior stemmons,How do you know that?
me, I've shot things with silencers... And the old lady didn't hear any                      * gunshots.
junior stemmons,You make a family member for it? Tommy?
me,Maybe...                                              *
junior stemmons,Do you want to issue an APB?
me,I want to talk to Bradley first. Where are the Mother and Daughter?                   *
me,It's Klein.
me,Hector's gone. Blood that may or may not be his leads out to the                      * garage. Two guard dogs shot dead but no other signs of a struggle. The house is intact.
bradley,Family?
me,Wife and Daughter are here.
bradley,Describe their state.
me,Mother Madge aggrieved.                              *  Daughter Lucille...indifferent. The                  * son is persona non grata and a strong early suspect.
bradley,"Alright, kick everyone out. Including all police personnel."
me,How's that?
bradley,Don't question me. Is your partner on hand?
me,Yeah...                                               *
bradley,"Have him bag and seal everything and bring it to Wilshire Station. Find Tommy Magdalena post-haste and take him into custody. No APB's, nothing to alert Noonan and the FBI to this situation."
me,You want me to-
bradley,-no more information over an open                     * line. I'll be at the Bethune event later on today. Find me there.
me,I'm giving you on-scene command.                      * Bradley wants everyone removed from the premises and the entire house bagged for evidence and brought to Wilshire Station.  Can you handle this?
junior stemmons,Entirely. Where are you going?
me,To find Tommy Magdalena.
me, Get Lester and get me a scotch                        * straight.                                             *
bartender,"Sanderline Johnson was my second                      * cousin, Peckerwood. I wouldn't                        * drink that with my gun hand."
lester lake,Lieutenant Dave Klein. Slayer of                      * Sanderline Johnson...y'got stones                     * showing up this far South.                            *
me,What happened to your face?
lester lake, Tommy Mag wanted to make sure I understood something he was saying.
me,Where is he?
lester lake,Left an hour ago. Emptied my safe.
me,Shit. He's wise.
lester lake,To what? You looking for him?
me, Just never got this...
lester lake,Too white to appreciate good grass.                   *
me,"Hector Magdalena is missing, presumed dead. Tommy is our sole suspect."
lester lake,Muthafucker -- there is a God. If only I'd known this an hour ago.
me,"Heartbreaker, huh? You let him gig here last night?"
lester lake,"I don't let him, he just does. Nails on a chalkboard too. He rushed the stage last week when we had Charlie Mingus drop in for a set. Mingus looked at this half-Mex                   * greaser kid trying to play `Round                     * Midnight,' said that fool couldn't                    * find them keys with a flashlight.'"
me,Tommy's playing days are over.
lester lake,Hallelujah.
me,What time did he show up?
lester lake,Around four. Him and these Pachucos         * poppin' switchblades like punks.  Is he really dead?                          *
me,"There's blood all over his house, seems to belong to him. There's just no body. Not yet."
lester lake, I don't feature Tommy for it.               *
me,"                   * How's that? How many times has he           * been in here, busted you up?"
lester lake,"Yeah, but he ain't got the salt             * to truly take a Man's life.                 * Especially not Hector's...he was            * scared of him.                              *"
lester lake,"Drugs. Especially here in South Central. Hector ran it uncontested. Lotta cats gonna rush in now, try to plant a flag.                                      *"
me,Tommy can't hold the throne?                          *
lester lake,"Tommy couldn't hold his pecker without Hector's help and he knows                    * that. He's gonna bury himself like                    * a tick. Good luck turning him up,                     * he took six or seven grand out the                    * safe tonight."
me,"Eyes and ears for me Lester. He turns up, you get in touch.  LESTER LAKE                                   * If I don't kill him first.                              *"
tom bethune,Not at all. My message of civic advancement manifested in that beautiful blue baseball team was starting to hit home.
tom bethune,I like my Dodger Dogs with mustard and relish!
koenig,I wouldn't have expected so public a showing after Sanderline Johnson.
me,He jumped Fritz.
koenig,I'm sure he did. And where is your young partner this day?
me,Working his first big job.
koenig,"Might the job involve the LAPD's most important missing Wetback, Hector Magdalena?"
me,It does.
koenig,"I've known Stemmons since the academy. He was a top pupil. A                * peculiar little pain in the ass, but very good with details."
me,Kid might have some climb in him.  Reminds me of another pain in the ass.
koenig,I'm puzzled as to why the Bradley would assign you to the Magdalena                     * case when you're neither Homicide nor Robbery...
me,"There's no body, and nothing was taken except Hector."
koenig,He does know how to delegate doesn't he...and also I'm sure that poor Negro's nosedive has put you squarely in his debt.
me,Something like that.                                  *
koenig,Keep me abreast will you? Chief Parker is understandably nervous. Situations like these tend to yield grief...and we've the FBI poking                      * around our garden patch.                              *
me,"My ass first Fritz, yours second."
bradley,-no. We can't risk that. Do you             * make him for the murderer?
me,Yeah. Hector's disappearance is definitely an inside job. That whole family feels hinky. The daughter was all bruises and no tears and Hector's hop-head wife            * looks part punching bag.
bradley,Do you suspect either of the women?         *
me,"According to Wilhite, they were in Santa Barbara at the time."
bradley,Verify that. Where is your partner?
me,Vouching in evidence at Wilshire Station.
bradley,"Keep him on that. He had excellent ratings as an evidence teacher and          * I trust him more than you.  Find Tommy Magdalena. Focus everything on that effort & I want him apprehended Klein, not killed."
me,What about Hector? Still missing.
bradley,"And most likely dead. Find the Son.         * Stakeout the residence. Put tails on both the mother and daughter -- I want this investigation working quietly, and around the clock."
me,Wilhite. He was operating Hector-
bradley,-don't worry about Dan Wilhite. You deal directly with me. Now go out the back. I don't want the press recognizing you.
me,You got a light?
woman, You got a cigarette?
me,It didn't look like you were all that upset with the attention.
woman,Good thing you're not a cop.
me, How's that?
woman,Your power of observation leaves lots to be desired.
me,Thank you.
woman,Don't thank me: these things are bad for you.
me,You believe everything you read?
woman,You believe anything you read?
me, Do you eat Dinner?
woman,No.
me,This everything from the house?
junior stemmons,Everything worthwhile.
me,What did you tell the Watch Commander upstairs?
junior stemmons,"                     * -here, this one, `Hurwitz Holdings'         * Hector had some real estate dealings-"
me,-bag it until Bradley orders us otherwise.
junior stemmons,               * How do you solve a case when the evidence is in bags?
me,You don't. Our job is to find Tommy.  And why is that out?
junior stemmons, -I thought we were investigating Magdalena's disappearance-
me,"-Don't write shit down. What do you         * need Kid? A little bouncing ball,           * bottom of the screen?                       *  Magdalena is twenty years dirty with this Department...do you think         * a word of that exists on paper?"
junior stemmons,...No.
junior stemmons,"Sure, Lieutenant.                                       *"
me,Shit.
milteer,Gregory Milteer. Attorney-at-Law. A pleasure Lt. Klein.
me,Dave. Sorry I'm late.                                  *
milteer,Indeed.  Please.
me, Where's Mr. Hughes?
milteer,Unavailable. Unfortunately. But I've been given full authority to-
me,-I'm not contagious...if that's what he's worried about.
milteer,I don't find that the least bit humorous Lt. Klein.
me,Yes you do. What's your pitch Mr.                      * Milteer?
milteer,"An `Actress' named Glenda Bledsoe signed a Service Contract that she's now willfully violating by acting in a Z-grade horror picture presently `shooting' in Griffith Park. Despite entreaties for her to cease participation in this absurdity, she continues to revel in her outlaw status with us. Thus we would like her destroyed."
me,What makes you think I can do a better job than your people?
milteer,Mr. Bondurant says you're one of the smarter people he knows-
me,-dubious honor if you knew the other people Pete knows.  So you want to catch her in violation of her Service Contract? Something like that?
milteer,"Exactly. The morality clause in particular as the damage to her reputation would be most devastating: Nymphomaniac, Criminal, Communist...anything along these lines. Once you visit the set of her `Attack of the Atomic Vampires,' you'll see the void that is her character. We haven't a photograph handy, but she's playing the lead female role.         *"
me,I'm happy to help. But my price is
milteer,"$10,000 should buy more than help."
me,"For 10 give it any name you want. I'm a salaried employee of LAPD,                      * that means I'll have to find time off hours to do this."
milteer,"Agreed. Start tonight. Someone's                      * been stealing groceries from our talent domiciles. There's no proof that it's her, but it's her. Peter will provide you addresses."
me, Thank you Peter.
milteer,We look forward to your updates.
me,"Sergeant, pass a message to Stemmons: I want him to meet me at the one-thousand block of South Tremaine tonight at 11 and at some point between now and then, I'll need him to do a preliminary work- up on a woman named Glenda Bledsoe.  B-L-E-D-S-O-E. Thanks."
director,"This is the big Armada landing, so I need everybody's energy up, up up! Where's my Alien Commander?"
werewolf,RIGHT HERE GOD DAMN IT.
mickey cohen,"Where Klein goes tsuris follows. This is what I hate about being down, lip from the likes of you."
me,If this is `down' I never want to see `out.' How the mighty have fallen.
mickey cohen," Which one of us are you talking about Klein? Word is the Federal Bureau is all hot and bothered with you Gonif. Hey, I hear J. Edgar schtups his personal assistant and makes him wear ladies hose."
me,What else are you hearing?
mickey cohen,"That this Welles Noonan character has developed quite a crush. That you might want to consider relocating to Dogdick, Delaware."
me,Been a marked man for years Mick.
mickey cohen,"But the bullseye on your back's never been quite so big...if you need a new line of work, I got this faygele leading man needs replacing-"
mickey cohen,His agent told me he could play straight.
me,No. But I am interested in your                       * leading lady. Bradley sent me. Saw                    * her at the Bethune-
mickey cohen,-not a chance. I'm still trying to play hide the submarine.
me,You want Chief Bradley angry?
mickey cohen,Ten years ago I could call for that                   * little Pisher's head on a stick.  And now...
me,"And now the only thing you're putting on sticks are corn dogs. What's her name, Mick?"
mickey cohen,Glenda.
me,                           * Why was she there?
mickey cohen,Low-budget strategy: I send Glenda and Rock to any event where there's cameras -- Glenda gets guest-a'- honor treatment everywhere with that shape a' her's...
me,What she drive?
glenda bledsoe,Coffee's in the kitchen. Let's go over this quick because I'm beat.
director,"We're set on a place where we can stash you and Rock. It's in Topanga Canyon, two weeks-"
rockwell, -two weeks? My body'll fall apart-
glenda bledsoe,-think of it as 14 days of push-ups-  Are you sure about this Sid? Seems shaky. Was this Mickey's idea?
director,"And I think it's brilliant! Inspired! The two leads of Mickey Cohen's magnum opus get kidnapped! The press'll eat it up! They'll write about `Gangster Mickey,' the glory days. Couple a' headlines like that and interest in Atomic Vampires will go through the roof!  Who's gonna grab you?"
glenda bledsoe,A charmer I knew in another life...George Ainge.
sid frizell,Is he okay with making it look real-
rockwell,-he can't hit me in the face!                         * That's a deal-breaker!
glenda bledsoe,"He'll be thrilled to knock me around. Plus he's holding something of mine, so we can kill two birds. He'll grab us Tuesday in front of the Pacific Dining Car.                               *"
rockwell,What about Hughes?
glenda bledsoe,What about him? That angle can only help us.
sid frizell,I'm dying to know...was he the Spruce Goose between the sheets?
me,STOP-
welles noonan,That's for Sanderline Johnson.
me, ARE YOU BLIND-
welles noonan,-what were you firing at?
me,The only lead on Magdalena -- we're after the same guy you idiot!
welles noonan," No, we were after you. But thanks for the name."
me,Coffee?
koenig,Ice. Bradley's on his way down.
junior stemmons,That's mine...you needed some                        * mopping up.
me,Who found me?
junior stemmons,"I did. I got there at eleven like you said, right as two black & white's pulled up: you were out                      * cold in a gutter `round the block.                   *  Did Noonan knock you out?"
me,He hit me with his car first.
junior stemmons, The Captain was the only one here at this hour...                                      *
klein,"If I need your help later on, can I count on it?"
koenig,Of course you can.
bradley,What are you doing here?
koenig,The Lieutenant was thirsty.
bradley,Progress on Magdalena.
junior stemmons,No fingerprints. Clean crime scene. Canvassed the neighborhood. A senile neighbor did report a possible Peeper-
me,-confirmed Peeper.
bradley,Is that who knocked you out?
me,Noonan knocked me out.
bradley, He's having you tailed then...
me,And he knows the Magdalena name and that I was chasing a suspect -- the                    * Peeper Lucille strips for.                             *
junior stemmons,She knows someone watches?
me,And who he is. She has to.  I want access to her juvie sheet or                    * whatever arrest records exist.                         * Rumor was Hector whored her out to                     * dealers he did business with.                          *
bradley,That's immaterial.                                     *
me,"No. Madge was a battered wife and                    * Lucille was a suborned whore. If                     * that's not motive, what is? You                      * want answers then we brace those                     * two hard."
me,Noonan will figure out who and what Hector was sooner or later.                     *
me,-until when?
bradley,"Until Tom Bethune votes on the floor of the city council in two days, ratifying the official start of construction on Dodger stadium-"
me,"-this is bigger than a fucking ballpark! Hector Magdalena and Narco is the powder-keg, blows the              * whole Department to hell.                       *"
bradley,"Don't be dramatic, it looks weak. Right now, Noonan needs a pursuit, so I supply him with one-                       *"
me,-me. You want me to draw him off-               *
bradley,"-you've been drawing him off. And the more he sees you the less he'll think of anything other than getting you. Now find Tommy and                 * take him alive. Do not let Noonan               * get to him. As a potential major                * case witness against the LAPD,                  * Tommy Magdalena isn't just a powder-            * keg, he's an atom bomb.                         *"
me,Seltzer will take the blood out.
junior stemmons,I give you the shirt off my back                        * and you bash me!                                        *
me,"When a Superior Officer tells you to leave the room, you leave the                        * fucking room.                                           *"
junior stemmons,I made a file on the Bledsoe broad. The one you asked about.
me,Thanks. But forget it.
junior stemmons,I spent a whole day putting it together and this skirt's got skeletons.
me,"Forget it. Burn it, s'not important now."
junior stemmons,Why is it not important?
me,"I need an address on a guy named Ainge, George Ainge-                                    *"
junior stemmons,-what about Magdalena?
me,"-after you get the Ainge address,                       * get back to the Magda-"
junior stemmons, -is Ainge related to this Cunt?
me,"We're partners in name only. You want to stay in the room next time, Junior? Do something to impress me: like finding that address."
glenda bledsoe,"Better looking than the last guy Howard hired. Once you heal.  Wait a minute. You were there, the other night, the Bethune Party...                     *"
me,Yeah.                                                 *
glenda,Mickey told me this `Bent Cop' everybody used to call-  -`The Enforcer' was asking about me. Told me to be careful. So you're LAPD after all...
me,In theory.
glenda bledsoe,You're going to arrest me for breaking and entering?
me,Depends.  Those Howard's?
glenda bledsoe,Everything's Howard's.
me,Except you.
glenda bledsoe,That's why I left.
me,You just shop here now?
glenda bledsoe,Some of our extras haven't had a vegetable since Truman.
me,Attack of the Atomic Vampires...
glenda bledsoe, We can't all be Audrey Hepburn. Plus it pays bills.
me,Better than a billionaire does? Go make amends and finish out your service contract Ms. Bledsoe.
glenda bledsoe,Not if there was just one day left on it.
me,Why?
glenda bledsoe,I'm better than that.
me,"You're also better than a starring role in schlock horror flick that'll never see a screen, regardless if it's leading lady gets `kidnapped' or not.                              *"
glenda bledsoe,This isn't the first time you've spied on me.
me,Nor the second.
glenda bledsoe," Well you've got me all giftwrapped, Enforcer-"
me,-Dave. You're on Hughes' bad side Ms. Bledsoe. It's not a bright place to be. So please go-
glenda bledsoe,-Glenda.  And tell Howard I'll take my chances with the fake vampires.
me,Klein. Go ahead...                                      *
dispatch,Message from a Lester Lake: asked that you contact him immediately.
me,"Get me Lester. This is Lieutenant Klein, LAPD-"
lester lake,Dave?
me,Got your message.
lester lake,"Girl that works here, gigs the late sets, the torch stuff Fridays and                 * Saturdays, name of Tilly Hopwell.                 *"
me,I saw her singing the other night.

me,Where's this girl now?                            *
lester lake,"Didn't show up for work last night.               * Called a friend of hers, a waitress that works here too, said she was                 * at Bido Lito's in Hollywood. Said                 * she was `hiding out.'"
me,She actually said `hiding out?'                   *
lester lake,"Then she got off the phone. Fast. If Tilly's running with that demon,               * you gotta get her out of there. She               * got a lot more good in her than not-              *"

me,Yeah.
koenig,Doing some ad hoc dope seizures for Dan Wilhite.  Still love taking the occasional door down.
me,You were born for the street Fritz. I never featured you for the suit and tie set.
koenig,We're of a common bloodline Boy-o.
me,Where'd you get that haul?
koenig,"Parker appreciates Bradley's political skills...and the addition of a professional Ball-club to our fare city fulfills his own personal mandate of a cleaner, brighter, LA."

glenda bledsoe,Impossible.
me,Me too.
me,Bradley trying to bury me too. That subpoena means my fifteen year career with the LAPD just went up in smoke.
me,Hey-
me,You find him?
pete,"Yeah. I swung by his apartment, car was out front. I scoped it: a sawed- off shotgun in front, canned tuna in the back seat. Think he's living outta that car. After he left, I tried to get inside his place: The front door is triple pad-locked."
me, That knife is in there-
pete,-the what?
me,Meet me down the street from his place. You got bolt cutters?
pete,I'll bring `em.
me,Thirty minutes.
pete,Who's car is that?
me,Long story.
pete,Junior looked real skeezed this morning. Like he was on a dope jag.
me,Yeah?
pete,Sweated up like a stuck pig. And be careful. He was fucking around with his front door before he left. I don't know what he was doing.
me,"Two honks if he shows. Then meet me in the alley, back of his place."
pete, What about this Bledsoe broad? Milteer has called me twice.
me, One thing at a time pal.
pete,Asshole!
me,"Get it open if you can and meet me back at Meg's!  Doesn't move until I pull the pin on the pineapple, drop the pin down on him. He jumps back in, peels off-"
junior stemmons,Stay right here. I'll get it all and come back. Don't move.
welles noonan,"Breaking and entering, theft, and willful destruction of private property...and I'll add attempted murder to the current first degree murder charge I'm about to file against you."
me,"Proof. If you had it, you wouldn't be fucking around with shitty shakedown routine -- you'd file. Coercion equals confession. So let's see you pound it out of me."
welles noonan,Where are the files you stole from Sergeant Richard Stemmons.
me,"Junior. Your secret weapon right? I mean, I know J. Edgar is a slanted fuck, but traditionally `vicious fags' don't make the best major case witnesses.  I'm worried those burning dildos may have damaged his credibility."
welles noonan,Oh I don't need his testimony Klein. I'll just force yours.
me,Not if you had the next hundred years.
welles noonan,"Sanderline Johnson, your links to Sam Giancana to Mickey Cohen, extortion, bribes, murder-for-hire. I'll put you in every pair of cross- hairs I can find. I'll torch everything you've ever touched. You have no idea how deep I run Klein. And how far I'm willing to go to fuck you-"
me,-everyone knows I'm a piece-a-shit. What are you proving? Bradley's the guy flanking you right now. The guy who's vulnerable right now.
welles noonan,You're all angles and graft Klein. Why trust a God damn word that comes out of your-
me,-you done anything with the Magdalena case?
welles noonan," Prelims: drug pusher gone missing, presumed dead, we're investigat-"
me, -Dealing drugs for 20 years! Arrested once. Hall a' fame career! You photographed the head of Narco in-front of his house...
welles noonan,AND?
me,"Jesus Christ, you need cue cards?  Come after me: you get me. Go after what I can give you and you get the LAPD's power-set on a slab."
welles noonan,"I don't believe you'd turn. Treacherous yes, traitorous no. Tell me where Stemmons' files are."
me,I'll bring them to you.
welles noonan,You're not leaving here Klein.
me,Then like I said: you only get me.
welles noonan,I'll take it.
me,"I give you the body of Dan Wilhite, head of LAPD's Narcotics Division. Proof of a 20-year criminal collusion between his department and Hector Magdalena and my testimony to link the dots.  Then I leave LA for good."
welles noonan,What happened to Wilhite?
me,Suicide.
welles noonan,Like Sanderline Johnson?
me,No more tails. I don't want anyone else incriminated.
welles noonan,Agreed.
me, I get a copy of that?
welles noonan,After a judge signs it. Now Leave.
welles noonan,No. Let him get comfortable...let him believe me.
pete,I know what Feds look like -- those were Feds with Junior...
me,Yeah and they made me leaving the scene. Had to barter out.
pete,Barter what?
me,My Testimony. I signed a Federal Witness Agreement.
pete,You what?
me,"It's bullshit. Noonan's got no intention of honoring it.  They want Stemmons files though. I think Junior's been working angles for awhile, doing his own investigations."
pete,"What did you do to his place? Nice quiet neighborhood one minute, Nagasaki the next."
me, How much longer do you need?
pete,"Few more hours. Maybe. Junior didn't skimp on this thing. I gotta bore right through the face plate.  You got some time now, why don't you get Milteer off my back and go work that Bledsoe broad."
me,You read my mind.
me,...tell me if I'm being too rough.
me,Tell me anything. Tell me everything.
glenda bledsoe,Where would I start?
me,Why here?
glenda bledsoe,Why L.A.?  Why is anybody here? Want the rest of the world to know who they are.
me,You?
glenda bledsoe,"No...I don't think so.  I just love it. I grew up in Seattle. My aunt, every week, she'd take me to the movies."
me,-your ticket to immortality?
glenda bledsoe,"Hughes told me he could get me in for this screen test two years ago. Movie with Gregory Peck at Universal. He thought he was humoring me...until I got it. They offered me the role...there in the room. So Howard, who I'm sure never thought in a million years I'd land that part, makes some phone calls and just like that they don't want me anymore.  Nobody calls now. I can't get in to see any studio casting people. He's ruined me in those circles."
me,And you still want it-
glenda bledsoe,-bad enough to put on a silly cheerleading skirt and try to make the most god-awful dialogue sound decent.
me,Surrounded by winos in werewolf suits.  That's...dedication.
glenda bledsoe,Or desperation. Depends on the day.
me,Dwight Gillette.
glenda bledsoe,"He asked me to take his `niece and nephew' to their cousin in Oxnard. These beautiful, funny little kids.  Why do they call you `Enforcer?'"
me,I've killed 44 men.
glenda bledsoe,`For profit -- mostly.'
me,I'm not much good.
glenda bledsoe,Me neither.
pete,Junior documented everything like a fucking Monk. 
me,You been up all night?
pete,In-case Stemmons made a house-call. He's got every goddamn address of everybody you know...  And you should've told me about the Bledsoe broad.
me,There's nothing to tell.
pete,"Then call Milteer about this dead Pimp Gillette. I'm no legal mind like you, but I'll bet a murder beef would violate her morals clause quick.  Collect the rest of your money."
me,I don't want it anymore.
pete,Then give that five grand back.
me,Junior stole it.
pete,"People are gonna start lining-up to see you bleed, Pal."
koenig," Your young partner called me at my home, early this morning."
me,Yeah.
koenig,And his apartment -- there was some type of disturbance? A fire?
me,That's why I needed his address. I was trying to help him before something like this happened. The kid snapped-in-half Fritz. He's literally lost it.  He say anything else to you?
koenig,Only that he was in possession of materials that might deeply damage Chief Bradley...and yourself.
me,"Like I said Fritz, he's flipped his lid. I don't want to go to Internal Affairs but I'm afraid Junior might've forced just that."
koenig,Let me try to locate the lad first Dave. Be a shame to ruin such a young career so soon.
me,Be careful Fritz. He's dangerous.
me,Where is he?
secretary, Out at the Ravine Lieutenant.
bradley,"-this area has long been rife with crime and venality, but with a brand new Stadium, we can make this horrible blight a bright spot and give our Los Angeles Dodgers the home they deserve.  Reuben Ruiz can tell you of his travails growing up in this horrible slum and why now is the time to `Redeem The Ravine.'"
bradley,"-Welles Noonan is an unscrupulous hack politician whose smear campaign against us will fail, for he has grievously underestimated the moral rectitude of the Los Angeles Police Department."
bradley,"Now if you'll excuse me, I'll leave you with Reuben Ruiz."
me,"Your subpoena hasn't caught up to me yet, Chief..."
me,Word gets out that the three City Officials who were pushing hardest for a Stadium also stood to gain a mint -- might color public opinion. Might color it even more to know that the LAPD's Chief of Detectives was trying to purchase a huge tract of that land from the biggest dope dealer in town.
me,Hector Magdalena owned ten and half acres of this land. 
bradley,How?
me,Junior Stemmons. The ex-evidence teacher. His `excellent ratings' didn't stop him from stealing the Magdalena seizure and doing his own investigation.
bradley,Why would he investigate me?
me,That was stapled to the cover.  Why would Noonan worry about a Turd like me now...when a high profile target like you can be taken down.
bradley,Where is Stemmons?
me,"No idea. If you haven't spoken to Internal Affairs today, I'm sure they've called. Junior's apartment caught fire. Deeply deviant material inside. Round him up-  -and anyone he's got with him."
bradley,I'll issue an A.P.B. saying Stemmons is a known deviant targeting kindergarten children.
me,"Now, quid pro quo...you subpoenaed Wilhite too."
bradley,How do y-
me,-don't worry `how.' Why?
bradley,Exposing the corrupt parts of the LAPD will redeem the whole. I'll prove that Police can police themselves-
me,-so you show-up Noonan...co-opt his crusade and condemn your own before he can...Jesus Christ can you turn lemons to lemonade.
bradley,No Cop will testify against other Cops. This is why Wilhite has suddenly disappeared.
me,And how.  So where do we go now Chief?
me,-that report is only useful to Noonan now.
bradley,No. It ensures our mutual destruction should you choose to share the contents of that Stemmons file. Which I know you won't do until you figure out how it will best benefit you.
me,Dead body.
pete,"Fucking Christ. You can't keep that car in the garage, the smell's coming into the house."
meg,Open the windows.
pete,That's not gonna help.
me," Take a couple bottles of bleach, pour it over the trunk."
pete,What do you got in there?
me,My foreseeable future.
meg,I'm going to work.
me,You taking her?
pete, I'm taking her.
pete,Hughes.
me,This is almost over Pete -- I'll give Milteer the five-grand back.
pete,It's more than that.
me,I'll square it. It's my thing.
pete,That you made mine.
me,I'm sorry.
pete,Look as bad as I've ever seen you.
me,Things are as bad as they've ever been...
junior stemmons,MOTHERFUCKER -- you better meet me! That Cooze you threw everything away for is still cooked! I got the knife. I got Ainge-
me,How'd you get this number Junior?
junior stemmons,I got everything on you! AND I'M GONNA USE IT!
me,-you're a broom-closet Queer. Your career is over.
junior stemmons,The knife for MY file on Bradley. I know you already burned that Whore's but don't think I can't re- do investigations.
me,"You snitch to Noonan, then what?"
junior stemmons,Fuck Noonan. I got stronger Allies.
me,Who? The Soviets?
junior stemmons,"Meet me in one hour with that file, Fern Dell Park-"
me,-Where you used to snag fruits for Vice? A volunteer gig I'm guessing.
junior stemmons,Be there with Bradley's file or I scratch your scabby Bitch.
me,"Hey, did the Feds dig your pad?"
glenda bledsoe,-Dave?
me, Glenda?
glenda bledsoe,Sorry...you gave me this number...
me,Jesus...hey...
glenda,Who were you talking-
me,"-no, no. It's nothing. I had a phone call, just before yours."
glenda,Was it him? The Cop you were telling me about?
me,I don't want you to worry. I'm handling it. But I might send my friend Pete out there.
glenda,You don't think it's safe?
me,I'd just rather have someone there with you.
glenda,I wish you would've woken me up this morning.
me,"I'm better-looking in low light, I didn't want to blow it for myself."
glenda,I miss you.
me,Where's the knife.
me,Turn your lights off...and just come out and talk to me...Fritz.
koenig,Not much with these sub-rosa things...
me, I thought it was Noonan tailing me.
koenig,Bradley's greatest stroke was enlisting you to his side.
koenig,When did you know?
me,I didn't. I had a feeling. I smelled cover-up all over Hector's disappearance and Wilhite wouldn't have the muscle or the mind-set to kingpin something that big by himself...you knew about Bradley trying to buy him out?
koenig,He was offering to exonerate Hector and clear his criminal record. Hector met with Wilhite and I to inform us of his decision...
koenig,"Darktown. Chavez Ravine. Hot Spots for Human Vice. These are slums I run & profit from. If these slums suddenly become Stadiums, that profit goes elsewhere...that crime goes elsewhere."
me,Bradley...you two got greed in common.
me,You knew about Wilhite and Lucille. That's how you were operating him.
koenig,I was aware of his sexual predilections.
me, ...and someone else's...
koenig," I knew young Stemmons here had a fondness for Lads, stretching back to his days at the academy."
me,And now you're his only ally.  So you get this file to battle Bradley with. What's Junior get in return?
junior stemmons,JUST YOU! YOU FUCK!
koenig," I don't want to watch...I'm sorry it came to this, Dave."
junior stemmons,"I hope the Bledsoe whore was worth it...'cuz she's still fucked. For a crooked cop, you think small."
koenig,This isn't it!
koenig,Poorly played Dave...poorly played...
koenig,Could I talk you into something? Cut you in on something?
me,Won't work for me Fritz.
koenig,Give me a minute then?
koenig, Okay...
bradley,Who?
me,Fritz Koenig.
bradley, Where?
me,"Dead. Along with Wilhite, Junior...and Hector Magdalena."
bradley,Why are you here?
me,To collect. I have the things you need to destroy Noonan's play. These same things can be used to destroy you.
bradley,Things like?
me,Stemmons files...and Wilhite's body. He committed suicide after you subpoenaed him.
bradley,This body is in your possession?
me,"And it's what you need to burn Narco to the ground...but if those files and his body were to be given to Noonan and the Feds, with me providing the cherry-on-top testimony of a rogue cop. Well. The word `Cataclysmic' comes to mind."
bradley,What will this cost?
me,A percentage of your Dodger Stadium stake in perpetuity. You buy my silence for a fourth of Hurwitz Holdings.
bradley,Doubtful.
me,"What'd you expect? A stick-up? Empty your safe? I'm about to disappear for good, and you're gonna fund my new life. You can't counter-punch out of this. Arrest me and I snitch the world.  I'm officially outta time now Chief. Call it."
bradley,Wilhite's body...Bury it.
me,"You go to bed drunk, or just been up all night."
klein,"Where's Glenda, is she asle-"
milteer,The harder you hit him the quicker I say `stop' -- and cease that absurd crying.
glenda bledsoe, THAT IMPOTENT SHIT-
milteer,-touch me and he dies.
milteer,You still have a job.
pete,...I'm sorry Dave...
me,I put you here...that Powerhawk-
pete,-there's a body in the trunk-
me,-burn it.
pete,I'm so sorry....
glenda,Let me take you to a hospital.
me,We'd never make it inside.
glenda, I'm worried.
me,I'm through the worst of it.
glenda,I don't believe you.
me,Whatever the cost.
glenda,Just like that then?
me,Just like that.
pete,"...be nice to be in with a billionaire who's got a fleet of planes, fly you outta the country on short notice..."
