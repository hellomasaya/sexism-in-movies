Speaker,Dialogue
midwife,He is strong.
amanda,... hello.
younger midwife,The baby is healthy. Why does she cry?
midwife, She is human.
sarek,Well done.
amanda,Thanks.
sarek,Your tone suggests disappointment. The Science Council required my presence for a session regarding--
amanda,Don't do that.     You knew I wanted you here.
sarek,"As you are aware, the Vulcan male is traditionally not present at the moment of delivery."
amanda,"Well traditionally, I'm not the one giving birth. "

sarek,You are correct. I should have been here. I am sorry.
amanda,No... Spock.  ... Spock.
sarek,The child has your eyes.
amanda,... and your ears.
captain robau,Report.
first officer,"Sir, new contact bearing zero-three-four."
captain robau,Any response?
officer pitts,No Sir -- hails met with silence.
captain robau,Maybe they're incapable -- any identifiable damage?
officer pitts,"Negative, Sir -- but our readings seem confused--"
5,15D   CONTINUED:                                                        15D
captain robau,Confused?
officer pitts,-- not only is the ship unregistered -- but even its construction materials seem unrecognizable.
captain robau,... oh my God...  Signal all departments: first contact protocols. Looks like we have someone new on the block. All Stop.
first officer,"Sir, should we initiate an invasive scan?"
captain robau,That could be seen as an act of provocation -- all readings passive--
captain robau,Damage report!
chief engineer,"Our shields did nothing, Sir! Never seen anything like it! Weapons off-line! Main power at 38 percent!"
7,24B   CONTINUED:                                                     24B
winona,-- what was that-- what's happening?!
first officer,-- you're okay-- thank God-- where are you?
winona,Medical bay-- I had a few close contractions-- I'm fine-- what was that?
first officer,Just sit tight-- stay there-- we'll be fine--
officer pitts,"They're firing another, Captain!"

captain robau,All remaining power to forward shields! Prepare the shuttles f--
ayel,My commander requests the presence of your captain in order to negotiate a cease-fire. You will come aboard our ship via shuttlecraft. Your refusal would be unwise.
captain robau,Walk with me.
captain robau,"If I don't report within fifteen minutes,"
first officer,"Sir, we could issue a mayday call to--"
captain robau," There is no help for us out here. If we're going down, we're taking them with us -- you save as many as you can."

first officer,"... aye, Captain."
captain robau,You're Captain now. Mr. Kirk.
george kirk,Lieutenant Pitts. Transfer Robau's vital signs to the main view screen.
officer pitts,Yessir.
science officer,Vitals on line.
george kirk, -- thank you.
captain robau,"Computer, initiate departure sequence."
officer pitts,"The shuttle's pulling out of main bay, Sir."
george kirk,I want to see him -- floodlights please.
officer pitts,His heart rate's elevated--
helmsman,He's scared.
george kirk,He's brave.    That's what he is.
ayel,Are you familiar with this craft?
captain robau,Who is your commander?  Is it him?
ayel,You will speak only to me.
captain robau,Then ask your commander what right he has to attack a Federation vessel.
ayel,That was hardly an attack. My commander will easily destroy your ship. If you do not respond to the question.
captain robau,I've never seen it. Or any ship like it.
ayel,"Are you familiar with -- or better, know the location of -- Ambassador Spock?"
captain robau,I am unfamiliar with Ambassador Spock.
ayel,A final question. What is the current stardate?

captain robau," ... hey, where are you from--?"
george kirk,I'm initiating General Order 13! Set self-destruct for maximum matter- antimatter yield! Two minute countdown!
officer pitts,Yessir!
george kirk,I want auto-pilot targeted for their fuel cells!
tactical officer,"Sir, unable to locate the ship's power source!"
george kirk,Then just target the damn thing dead center!
helmsman,We got bigger problems: the first hit destroyed auto-pilot! 
13,26K   CONTINUED:                                                         26K HELMSMAN  The only way we're gonna ram that ship is to fly manual control!
george kirk,"-- then I'll do it myself -- get to the shuttles, now!  THAT'S AN ORDER! GO!"
nurse,We're packing it up -- you'll deliver in the shuttle!
winona,-- George!
george kirk,"I have medical shuttle 37 standing by, get to it now -- can you do that?"
winona,Yes -- where are you?
14,26M   CONTINUED:                                                     26M
george kirk,I'm on my way.
winona,"Good-- and George, it's coming-- our baby, it's coming now."
george kirk,"I'll see you in a minute, sweetheart."
winona,-- Agh!   That was-- that was a big one!
nurse,"Just keep breathing, Honey, you're gonna be just fine--"
winona," -- the baby, too, right?"
nurse,-- the baby too.
15,26R   CONTINUED:                                                      26R
george kirk,Captain to shuttle 37 -- is my wife on board?
shuttle pilot,"Yessir, she is--"
george kirk,"I need you to go now, d'you hear me?"
shuttle pilot,"We're waiting for you, Sir--"
george kirk,"No-- go, take off, immediately."
shuttle pilot,... yessir!
winona,"Wait! We can't go, my husband isn't here yet! Please! STOP--!"
nurse,You'll need to push now-- are you ready?
winona,The shuttle's leaving-- where are you?
george kirk,"My love?   Listen carefully, okay?"
winona,-- we're about to have this baby --
george kirk,Sweetheart... I'm not going to be able to be there.
winona,"-- no-- no, no-- wait--"
doctor,Okay-- you need to push.
george kirk,"Hey!   Hey, so what is it?"
winona's voice,-- it's a boy.
george kirk,It's a boy?   Yeah?
winona,"He's-- he's beautiful, he looks like you."
george kirk,"I know-- so what should we call him, huh?"
winona,We could name him after your father.
george kirk,"Tiberius? Are you kidding me? No, that's the worst-- we'll name him after your dad-- let's call him Jim."
winona,... Jim.   Jim it is.

computer voice,Your score is one-hundred percent. Congratulations. Spock.
young spock,I presume you've prepared new insults for today.
young spock,I have no such information.
young spock, This is your thirty-fifth attempt to elicit an emotional response from me. Logic dictates you would cease by now.
young spock,I did not mean to create conflict between you and mother.
sarek,In marriage... conflict is...
young spock,... constant?
sarek,"Natural.  Emotions run deep within our race. In many ways, more deeply than in humans. Long ago, they nearly destroyed us... that is why we followed the teachings of Surak. Now you must choose."
young spock,... between you and mother?
sarek,"Never, my son. But you may choose the ethic of logic. Logic offers a serenity humans seldom experience. The control of feelings... so that they do not control you."
young spock,They called you a traitor.  You suggest that I should be completely Vulcan... and yet you married a human... why?
sarek,"As Ambassador to Earth, my duty is to observe and understand human behavior. Marrying your mother... was logical.  Spock. You are fully capable of choosing your own destiny. The question you are faced with... is which path you will take. This is something only you can decide."
uncle frank,Go ahead: go-- run away! You know I could give a damn!
young kirk,-- wait-- no!    Where are you going?
uncle frank,Which won't be far enough -- know what your problem is?!  -- what the hell are you doing?
young kirk,I-- I just don't want my brother to go.
23,47    CONTINUED:                                                      47
uncle frank,Well I do-- and I asked you to wash the car! How many damn times do I need to repeat myself?! How many damn times? How many?
young kirk,Please stay-- you can have my Flo-Yo!
jim,Don't leave -- okay? We can tell Mom when she gets back from Africa.
cop,"Son, you pull over that car!"
jim,I CAN'T HEAR YOU!

amanda,Spock.
spock,"I am hardly ""anxious"", mother.  And ""fine"" has variable definitions. ""Fine"" is unacceptable."

amanda,... anything.
spock,Should I choose to complete the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr... and purge all emotion... I trust you will not feel it reflects judgement upon you.
amanda,As always... whoever you choose to be... you will have a proud mother.
science minister,You have surpassed the expectations of your instructors. Your final record is flawless. With one exception. I see you have applied to Starfleet as well.
spock,It was logical to cultivate multiple options.
science minister,"Logical but unnecessary. You are hereby accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy. A distinction all the more significant given that you will be its first half- human pupil. It is truly remarkable, Spock. That you have achieved so much despite your disadvantage. Welcome to the Academy."
spock,"If you would clarify, Minister-- what ""disadvantage"" are you referring to?"
science minister,... your human mother.
30,58   CONTINUED:                                                         58
spock,Council -- ministers.    I must decline.
science minister,No Vulcan has ever declined admission to this academy.
spock,"Then as I am half-human, your record remains untarnished."
science minister,Why did you come before this council today? Was it to satisfy your emotional need to rebel?
spock,"I came with the intention of enrolling, as my father wished. However, your ""insight"" has convinced me otherwise. Therefore, the only emotion I wish to convey is gratitude. Thank you, Ministers, for your consideration.  Live long and prosper."
31,59   CONTINUED:                                                    59
uhura,"Hi. I'd like a Klabnian Fire Tea, two Cardassian Sunrises and three Earth beers, no slim-shots, anything on draft."
uhura,"And a shot of Jack, straight up."
kirk, Make it two -- her shot's on me.
uhura,Her shot's on her. Thanks but no thanks.
kirk,Don't you want my name before you completely reject me?
uhura,I'm good without it.
kirk,"You are good without it. It's Jim. Jim Kirk.  If you don't tell me your name, I'm gonna have to make one up."
uhura, Uhura.
kirk,Uhura? No way -- that's the name I was gonna make up for you. Uhura what?
uhura,Just Uhura.
kirk,They don't have last names in your world?
32,59   CONTINUED:                                                     59
uhura,Uhura is my last name.
kirk,"They don't have first names in your world? Wait, let me guess. Is it ""Jim""?"
uhura,Xenolinguistics. Lemme guess: you don't know what that means.
kirk,"Let me guess: study of Alien languages: phonology, morphology, syntax-- it means you've got a talented tongue."
uhura,And for a moment I thought you were just a dumb hick who only has sex with farm animals.
kirk,Well.    Not only.
uhura,You think you're smart.
kirk,"Oh, baby, I'm the smartest."
burly cadet,This guy bothering you?
uhura,"Beyond belief, but nothing I can't handle."
kirk,You could handle me.    That's an invitation.
burly cadet,Hey.    You mind your manners.
33,59   CONTINUED:                                                      59
kirk,"At ease, Cup Cake, it was a joke.     Like your hairline."
uhura,Hey -- Jim: enough.
burly cadet,What was that?
kirk,"You heard me, Moon Beam."
burly cadet,You know how to count farm boy?    There's five of us... and one of you.
kirk,"Okay, so go get some more guys, come back and it'll be an even fight."
uhura,Enough!    STOP!
pike,"Outside, all of you!       NOW!"
kirk,"You can... whistle really loud, y'know that?"
pike,I couldn't believe when the bartender told me who you are.
kirk,"... and who am I, Captain Pike?"
pike,"Your father's son.  For my dissertation, I was assigned the U.S.S. Kelvin. Something I admired about your dad... he didn't believe in no-win scenarios."
kirk,He sure learned his lesson.
pike,"Depends on how you define winning. You're here, aren't you?  Those cadets you took on, they'll make competent officers -- but you can bet your ass they'll run home to momma the minute they're looking down the barrel of a Klingon phaser cannon."
kirk,-- why are you talking to me?
pike,"I looked up your file while you were drooling on the floor. Your aptitude tests were off the charts-- what is it, d'you like being the only Genius Level repeat-offender in the midwest?"
kirk,Maybe I love it.
35,61   CONTINUED:                                                       61
pike,So your daddy dies... you can settle for a less-than-ordinary life.  Or do you feel like you're meant for something better? Something special?
kirk,"Come to think of it, I do want to feel special. You know what? I'm gonna go start a book club--"
pike,Enlist in Starfleet.
kirk,Enlist. You must be way down on your recruiting quota for the month--
pike,"If you're half the man your father was, Jim, Starfleet could use you. You could be an officer in four years, have your own ship in eight."
kirk,"We're even, right?   I can go."
pike,"Riverside shipyard. Shuttle for new recruits leaves tomorrow, 0800.  Your father was Captain of a Starship. For twelve minutes. I dare you to do better."
shuttle pilot,"Waiting for something, Cap?"
pike,... No.   Guess not.
shipyard worker,"Nice ride, man."
kirk,Live it up.

uhura, And you never will.
man's voice,"Are you people deaf? I told you I don't need a doctor, damnit! I AM A DOCTOR!"
man,I might throw up on you.
kirk,I think these things're pretty safe--
man,"Don't pander to me, kid: one tiny crack in the hull and our blood boils in thirteen seconds -- solar flare might crop up, cook us in our seats -- Hell, some of the damn passengers are blue. And wait'll you're sitting pretty with a case of Andorian shingles, see if you're still so relaxed when your eyeballs are bleeding-- space is disease and danger, wrapped in darkness and silence."
kirk,"I hate to break this to you, but Starfleet operates in space."
38,64    CONTINUED:                                                    64

kirk,Jim Kirk-- you really gonna throw up--?
mccoy,Maybe--
nero,The wait is over.
kirk,"So you'll do it for me, right?"
mccoy,I have no interest.
kirk,"I didn't ask if you have interest, I asked if you'd do it."
mccoy,I'm about to ask you an obvious question: why bother?
kirk,Because I've failed the test twice.
mccoy,"And you're determined to make it three. We've all failed it-- everyone has, and that's the point! No one goes back for seconds, let alone thirds -- it's not like you need to pass it to graduate."
kirk,So Bones: why do they make us take it?
mccoy,I told you to stop calling me that. You're very annoying.
kirk,And you're the greatest -- thank you.
mccoy,You'd better study for it this time.
kirk,"Oh, no-- Bones -- I gotta date."

gaila,"-- oh Jim... Jim... Jim, I love you."

gaila,"Yeah, been running simulations all week, just catching up on some rest. Tired.  That's all."
uhura,Were you running simulations with the mouth-breather hiding under the bed?
kirk,Your hearing is scary-- you sure both your parents are human?
uhura,The hell are you doing with him in here?

uhura, You're gonna fail.
kirk,"If I pass, will you tell me your first name?"
uhura,No.   Good night.
kirk, I think the fact that you picked up a transmission of a Klingon prison escape is very interesting.
ayel,We have arrived at the coordinates you
nero,Standby.
ayel,"Captain... long range scans of Beta Quadrant complete. Romulus is there. She's there. We could go. Right now, go home..."
nero,Not yet -- not like this. Not how we left. This is our chance... to serve our people. We owe it to them -- to do what no other Romulan could ever do.

kirk,"""Starfleet Command has ordered us to rescue them... Captain."""
mccoy,Klingon vessels have entered the Neutral Zone. And they are firing upon us.
kirk,That's okay.
mccoy,It's okay?

mccoy,Three more Klingon Warbirds decloaking -- and targeting our ship -- I don't suppose this is a problem either?
kirk,Nah.
weapons officer,"They're firing, Captain."
kirk,Alert medical bay to prepare to receive all crew members from the damaged ship.
uhura,And how do you expect us to rescue them when we're surrounded by Klingons?
kirk,Alert medical.
mccoy,Our ship is being hit -- shields at sixty percent.
kirk,I understand.
mccoy,"Should we at least, I dunno, fire back?"
kirk,Mmmm... no.
mccoy,Of course not.
uhura, -- the Kobayashi Maru is still in distress... but... the Klingons have stopped firing.
kirk,Arm photons. Prepare to fire on the Klingon warbirds.
mccoy,"Jim, their shields are up."
kirk,Are they?
mccoy,... no.
kirk,Fire on all enemy ships -- one photon each should do -- let's not waste ammunition.
weapons officer,Target lock acquired on all warbirds -- firing!

academy president,James T. Kirk.     Step forward.
kirk, Yessir. I believe I have the right to face my accuser directly.
47,83   CONTINUED:                                                      83
academy president,"Step forward please. This is Commander Spock, one of our most distinguished graduates. He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru test for the last four years."
spock,"Cadet Kirk. It is obvious you somehow managed to install and activate a sub- routine in the programming code, thereby changing the conditions of the test."
kirk,Your point being?
academy president,"In academic vernacular, you cheated."
kirk,"Respectfully.    Define ""cheating""."
spock,To deceive by trickery.
kirk,"Now let me ask you something I think we all know the answer to: the test is rigged, isn't it? You programmed it to be unwinnable."
academy president,"Mr. Kirk, I don't see how the intent of the exam is relevant to these proceedings."
kirk,"Because if I'm right, Sir, then the test itself is a cheat."
spock,Your argument precludes the possibility of a no-win scenario --
kirk,I don't believe in no-win scenarios --
48,83   CONTINUED:                                                       83
spock,"Then not only have you violated the rules, you've failed to understand the principle lesson."
kirk,"Please, enlighten me."
spock,"You, of all people should know, Cadet Kirk -- A captain cannot cheat death."
kirk,"""I of all people?"""
spock,"Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk, had assumed command of his vessel before killed in action, did he not?"
kirk,How long did it take you to look that up?
spock,How long did it take you to program the virus that allowed you to cheat?
kirk,Maybe you just don't like that I beat your test.
spock,"I am Vulcan. ""Like"" is not a verb in our vernacular. I've simply made the logical deduction that you're a liar."
kirk,What an idiot I am for taking that personally --
spock,"Agreed. Furthermore, you have failed to divine the purpose of the test."
48a,83   CONTINUED:                                                    83
kirk,Enlighten me again.
spock,The purpose is to experience fear. Fear in the face of certain death. To accept that fear and maintain command of one's self and one's crew. This is a quality expected in every Starfleet captain.
kirk,So you're telling me the point.      Of the whole thing. Is to be afraid?
spock,"Fear is necessary, yes."
kirk,"Have you taken the test, Commander Spork?"
spock,"Spock. As a Vulcan, I require no additional training to control my narcissism when making command decisions."
kirk,"You keep reminding me that you're Vulcan. And I'm sure you're really proud of that, who wouldn't be-- but isn't it true you people don't experience fear at all?"
49,83   CONTINUED:                                                    83
academy president," Cadet Kirk -- you are on academic probation pending the result of your hearing. Cadets, report to Shuttle Hangar One immediately -- this hearing is at recess until further notice -- dismissed."

barracks leader, You're on academic probation. That means you're grounded until the Academy Board rules.
mccoy,"... Jim, the Board'll rule in your favor. Most likely.  Look, Jim -- I gotta go --"

spock,"Consistently, yes--"
uhura,"And while you were well aware that my unqualified desire was to serve on the U.S.S. Enterprise, I was assigned to the Farragut."
spock,It was an attempt to avoid the appearance of favoritism.
uhura,No. No. I am assigned to the Enterprise.
spock,"Oh.     Yes, I believe you are."
kirk,What are you doing?
mccoy,"Doing you a favor. I couldn't just leave you there, looking all pitiful-- roll up your sleeve, I'm gonna give you a vaccine against viral infection from Melvaran mud fleas."

mccoy,"But I am, and Medical Code states the treatment and transport of a patient's to be determined at the discretion of his attending physician, which is me.  You can see he's suffering, he needs me as his doctor, so since I'm assigned to this ship, so's he, or would you like to explain to Captain Pike why the Enterprise warped into a crisis without one of its medical officers?"
scanning officer,... as you were.
mccoy,As you were.
kirk,I might throw up on you.

kirk,--- what? How the hell would I know?     Is Uhura on board?
mccoy,"You need an antidote, Jim, or you're gonna die."
mccoy,"Jim, I'm not kidding, you gotta keep your heart rate down."

mccoy,Yessir.
kirk,"Fact: the same anomaly -- a lighting storm in space -- that we saw today also occurred on the day of my birth, before a Romulan ship attacked the U.S.S. Kelvin. "
62,"102   CONTINUED:  Fact: This ship -- which had formidable and advanced weaponry -- was never seen or heard from again -- fact: the Kelvin attack took place on the edge of Klingon space and at 11-hundred hours last night there was an escape from a Klingon prison planet -- Rura Penthe -- fact: the escaped prisoners were Romulans, Sir, and it was reported that they stole a ship from the prison dock."
pike,And you know of this prison escape how?
uhura,"Sir, I-- I intercepted and translated the message myself. Kirk's report is accurate."
kirk,"We're warping into a trap-- there are Romulans waiting for us, I promise you that."
spock,"The cadet's logic is sound.  And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched in xenolinguistics, we would be wise to accept her conclusion."

hannity,"The other ships are out of warp and have arrived at Vulcan, Sir-- but we seem to have lost all contact--"
uhura,"Captain, I pick up no Romulan transmissions -- or transmissions of any kind in the area. There seems to be something jamming all communication around Vulcan."

nero,I do not speak for the Empire. We stand apart. As does your Vulcan crew member... isn't that right? Spock?
spock, Pardon me. But I don't believe you and I are acquainted.
nero,"... no, we're not. Not yet.  Captain Pike-- your transporter capability is disabled. You will man a shuttle and come aboard the Narada for negotiations. That is all."
pike,I understand that --  I need officers who have been trained in advanced hand-to-hand combat!
sulu,"I have training, Sir!"
67,115   CONTINUED:                                                  115

chekov,"Aye, Keptin."
pike,Let's go.
pike,"Without transporters, we can't beam off the ship, can't assist Vulcan, can't do our job. I'm creating an opportunity: Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu and Mr. Olson will space-jump from the shuttle. You'll have chutes -- you'll land on that machine they've lowered into the atmosphere that's scrambling our gear-- you'll get inside, disable that thing then beam back to the ship."
kirk,... okay.
pike,"Mr. Spock, I'm leaving you in command of the ship. Once we have transport capability and communications back up, you'll contact Starfleet and report what the hell's happening here. "
68,117   CONTINUED:                                                       117 PIKE  Kirk. I'm promoting you to First Officer.
spock,"Captain. Please. I apologize, but the complexities of human pranks escape me."
pike,"It's not a prank, Spock.   And I'm not the Captain. You are."
kirk,"Once we knock out that machine... Sir, what happens to you?"
pike,I guess you'll have to come get me.  Careful with the ship. She's brand new.
spock,"Dr. Puri, report --"
mccoy,"It's McCoy-- Dr. Puri was on Deck 6, he's dead."
spock, Then you have just inherited his responsibility as Chief Medical Officer.
mccoy,"Aye, Sir."

spock,They're creating a black hole... at the center of Vulcan?
chekov,... yessir.

chekov,"... minutes, Sir. I'd say minutes."
spock," Alert Vulcan Command Center to signal a planetwide evacuation-- all channels, all frequencies -- maintain standard orbit --"
uhura,"What?   Spock, wait --"
spock,To evacuate the Vulcan High Council-- they're tasked with protecting our cultural history. My parents will be among them--
uhura,-- you can't beam them out?
spock,"It's not possible -- they'll be in the Katrik Arc, I must get them myself--"

chekov,Compensating gravitational pull and-- GOTCHA!

kirk,The surface of what? YOU'RE GOING DOWN THERE? Are you nuts?!
spock,Energize --

chekov,NO!!!   I'M LOSING HER!!!
spock,"Nero, who has destroyed my home planet. And most of its six billion inhabitants. I estimate no more than ten thousand survived.  While the essence of our culture has been saved, in the elders who now reside upon this ship... I am now a member of an endangered species."
uhura,I'm so sorry.
spock,... I need...
kirk,"Hey.  Listen, about what happened at Starfleet. The test and everything-- I know it looks like I was... using you, or whatever. And I'm sorry. I really am. And... I just hope you'll forgive me."
not gaila, No.
kirk, Sorry.
spock,"Lieutenant, have you confirmed that Nero is headed for Earth?"
uhura,"Their trajectory suggests no other destination, Captain."
kirk,"Earth may be his next stop, but we have to assume every Federation planet's a target."
chekov,"Yes, agreed-- but why didn't they destroy us?"
82,153   CONTINUED:                                                        153
sulu,Why waste a weapon?      We weren't a threat.
spock,That's not it.     He said he wanted me to see something.     The destruction of my home planet.
mccoy,And how the hell did they do that by the way? When did they jump so far ahead in the arms race?
spock,The engineering comprehension necessary to artificially create a black hole may suggest the answer: such technology could theoretically be manipulated to create a tunnel through space time.
mccoy,"Damnit, man, I'm a doctor, not a physicist -- are you suggesting they're from the future?"
kirk,That is what he's suggesting and I don't buy it.
spock,"If you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains -- however improbable -- must be the truth."
mccoy,How poetic.
kirk,Then what would an angry future Romulan want with Captain Pike?
sulu,As Admiral he knows details of Starfleet's defenses.
kirk,"What we need to do is catch up to that ship. Disable it, take it over and get Pike back."

mccoy," Fantastic, I'm in."
spock,Captain Pike left us with standing orders to rendezvous with the fleet on the other side of the quadrant. 
83,153   CONTINUED:  We're technologically outmatched in every way. A rescue attempt would be illogical.
kirk,"""Illogical""-- you're funny."
chekov,Not to mention we couldn't do it anyway: Nero's ship would have to drop out of warp for us to overtake them --
kirk,-- what about assigning Engineering crews to try and boost our warp yield?
spock,We must gather with the rest of Starfleet to balance the terms of our next engagement --
kirk,"There won't be a next engagement, Spock: by the time we've ""gathered"", it'll be too late -- how many planets are you willing to risk? You say he's from the future? Knows what's gonna happen? Then the logical thing is to be unpredictable."
spock,"You're assuming Nero knows how events are predicted to unfold. The contrary: Nero's very presence has altered the flow of history, beginning with the attack on the U.S.S. Kelvin, culminating in the events of today -- thereby creating a new chain of incidents that cannot be anticipated by either party."
mccoy,Does anyone understand him?
uhura, ... an alternate reality.

85,154   CONTINUED:  I only have one for you. I need the subspace frequencies of Starfleet's border detection grids. Specifically those surrounding Earth.
pike,"Christopher Pike -- Captain, U.S.S."
nero,Christopher.  Answer my question.
pike,No. You answer for the genocide you just committed on a peaceful planet--
nero,I prevented genocide.  I sit here now... knowing you as enemies. Not just of today. But of tomorrow. I watched as your Federation did nothing. They let us burn to death... as our planet broke in half.
pike,"Then Nero, you're confused. Romulus has not been destroyed. How can you blame the Federation for something that hasn't happened--?"
nero,It did happen. I remember it. I... felt it. 
86,154   CONTINUED:  A feeling that every surviving Vulcan now shares.
pike,If what you say is true... you can save Romulus. You have a second chance to --
nero,"-- yes, which is a gift I won't waste on mercy.  ... but to create a Romulus which exists, free of the Federation. Only then will she be saved."
pike,Then we have nothing more to discuss.
nero,It's not the fault of the human race that Starfleet chose Earth as its center. You're a more noble race than my fallen cousins. I'll take no pleasure in your extinction.
pike,How reassuring.
nero,"The frequencies, please."

kirk, Bullshit.
spock prime,It's remarkably pleasing to see you again.  ... especially after the events of today.
kirk,"Old friend. Sir, I don't have any idea how you know what you know. But I don't know you and if you are Spock we're not friends. You hate me. You marooned me here for mutiny..."
spock prime,Mutiny?   You are not the Captain?

spock prime,"""Cthia"" is the stricture that binds our emotions... but few of us are that perfectly Vulcan."
kirk,Going back in time... you changed all our lives.

kirk,Tactical and Communications --
spock prime,-- Sulu --
kirk,"-- he's the helmsman, why?"
spock prime,"Dr. McCoy would assert our meeting here is not a matter of coincidence... but rather, indication of a higher purpose."
kirk,... he'd call it a damn miracle.
spock prime,"Yes he would. Perhaps the time stream's way of attempting to mend itself. In both our histories, the same crew found its way onto the same ship in a time of ultimate crisis -- therein lies our advantage.  We must go-- there's a Starfleet outpost not far from here."
96,174   CONTINUED:                                                  174

mccoy,"Do you. Okay then: are you out of your Vulcan mind? Were you doing the logical thing? Maybe. The right one? Debatable. But one thing's for damn sure -- that kid doesn't know how to lose. Just isn't in his DNA. Back home we have a saying: ""If you're gonna ride in the Kentucky Derby, don't leave your prize stallion in the stable."""
spock,"... a curious metaphor, Doctor. As a stallion must first be broken before it can reach its potential."
mccoy,"My God, Man... you could at least act like it was a hard decision."
spock,"I intended to assist in the effort to re- establish communication with Starfleet. However, if crew morale would be better served by my roaming the halls weeping, I'll gladly defer to your medical expertise."
kirk,I AM SO PISSED OFF AT THE OTHER YOU RIGHT NOW!
98,175   CONTINUED:                                                        175
kirk,... hello?!
keenser,... can I help you?
spock prime,Are you the station chief?
keenser,... no.   This way.
starfleet officer,Hm.
keenser,Visitors.
starfleet officer,You realize how unacceptable this is.
kirk,Excuse me?
spock prime, ... Fascinating.
kirk,What?
starfleet officer,"I'm sure it's no' your fault, and I know youse lads are just doing your jobs, but could you no' have come a wee bit sooner?! "
99,"175   CONTINUED:  Six months I've been living on nothing but Starfleet Protein Nibs and the promise of a real food delivery! Six months, boys! It's pretty clear what's going on here, isn't it? Punishment! Ongoing! For something that was clearly an accident!"
spock prime,You're Montgomery Scott.
kirk,You know him?
scotty,"Yes, that's me -- Scotty-- you're in the right place-- are there any other hard- working and equally-starving Starfleet officers around?"
keenser,Me.
scotty,"You eat nothing. A bean and you're done for a week, I need food. And now you're here -- so. Thank you. Where is it."
spock prime,You are in fact the Mr. Scott who postulated the theory of trans-warp beaming.
scotty,"Yes! That's exactly what I'm talking about! How d'ya think I ended up here? I got into a debate with my instructor on the issue of Relativistic Physics as they pertain to subspace travel... He seemed to think that the range of transporting say, a roast turkey, was limited to a few hundred miles -- so I told my instructor I could not only beam a bird from one planet to an adjacent planet in the same system -- which is no big deal anyway -- but if I were so inclined I could actually do it with a lifeform! So I tested it on Admiral Archer's prize beagle. Which... was a mistake."
kirk,I know that dog. What happened to it?
100,175   CONTINUED:                                                    175
scotty,I'll tell ya when it reappears.     Dunno. Feel guilty.
spock prime,What if I told you your trans-warp theory was correct? That it is indeed possible to beam onto a ship that is travelling at warp speed. And that you only required the correct field equation to recrystallize dilithium?
scotty,"I haven't been stationed here that long. If such an equation had been discovered, I'da heard."
spock prime,"The reason you haven't heard of it, Mr. Scott... is because you haven't discovered it yet."
scotty,"Y'from the future, are ya? Brilliant. D'they still have sandwiches where you're from? Piece and jam? Mince 'n tatties? Cockaleekie soup?"
kirk,What is he talking about?
keenser,Food.
spock prime,Allow us access to your shuttle... and I will show you what a genius you actually are.
scotty,"She's a wee bit dodgy: shield emitters are totally banjaxed, along wi' a few other things."
101,177   CONTINUED:                                                      177
spock prime,Your equation for achieving trans-warp beaming.
scotty,Imagine that! Never occurred to me to think of space as the part that's moving.
spock prime,Point of fact: it did occur to you.  Extrapolating Enterprise's course --
scotty,"-- Enterprise? Had its maiden voyage already, has it? Well, you must've done something right to be assigned to that ship, Kiddo. She's a well endowed lady -- love to get my hands on her ample nacelles, if you'll pardon the engineering parlance."
spock prime,"Now's your chance, Mr. Scott."
scotty,"Look, even if I believed you -- where you're from, what I've done-- which I don't -- we're still talkin' bout slingshotting aboard while she's going faster than light. Without a proper receiving pad, that's like tryin'a hit a bullet with a smaller bullet, wearing a blindfold. On a horse."
spock,I calculate no more than a four meter margin of error.
scotty,That's all well and good unless you rematerialize four meters outside the ship.
102,177   CONTINUED:                                                   177
spock prime,Agreed: the aft engineering bay is your best option: a large space and no unpredictable airlocks --
kirk,"-- you're coming with us, right?"
spock prime,"No, Jim. My destiny lies along a different path."
kirk,You're telling me I can't tell you I'm following your own orders? Why not? What happens?
spock prime,"Trust me. Above all. Jim, this is the one rule you cannot break. To stop Nero, you alone must take command of your ship."
kirk,"How, over your dead body?"
spock prime,"Preferably not. There is, however, Starfleet Regulation 619.  Yes. I forget what little regard you had for such things. 619 states that any commanding officer who is emotionally compromised by the mission at hand... must resign said command."
kirk,So I need to emotionally compromise you?
spock prime,Jim.  I just lost my planet. I can tell you.  I am emotionally compromised.  What you must do... is get me to show it.
103,177   CONTINUED:                                                   177
kirk,Hm.
scotty,"Aye, then. Live or die, Laddie, let's get this over with. he Enterprise has a decent cafeteria I'm guessing."
kirk,You know... coming back in time... changing history... that's cheating.
spock prime,A trick I learned from an old friend.
kirk,-- no-- shit!
104,179   CONTINUED:                                                        179
computer voice,Turbine Shutdown Not Allowed.
kirk,DAMNIT!
chekov,"Keptin, we're detecting unauthorized access to a water turbine control board!"
spock,Bring up video.
kirk,You all right?
scotty, -- ship. Really.
kirk,-- let's get to the bridge--
kirk,Surprise.
spock, Who are you?
kirk,He's with me.
106,184   CONTINUED:                                                        184
spock,We're travelling at warp -- how did you manage to get aboard this ship?
kirk,"You're the genius, you figure it out."
spock,As Captain of this vessel I order you to answer the question.
kirk,Well I'm not telling.  Captain.
spock,"You are not a member of this ship's crew. Under penalty of court martial, I order you to explain to me how you beamed ab --"
kirk, -- Don't answer him.
spock,You will answer me.
scotty,I'd rather not take sides.
spock,Escort them to the Brig.
kirk,"What is it about you, Spock? Your planet was just destroyed -- your mother murdered -- and you're not even upset?"
107,184   CONTINUED:                                                   184
spock,Your presumption that these experiences interfere with my abilities to command this ship is inaccurate--
kirk,HA! And yet you said fear was necessary for command. I mean -- did you see that bastard's ship? Did you see what he did?
spock," Yes, of course I--"
kirk,So are you afraid or aren't you?!?
spock, I will not... allow you to lecture me about the merits of emotion.
kirk,Then why don't you stop me.
spock,"Step away from me, Mr. Kirk."
kirk,What is it like? Not to feel? Anger. Or heartbreak. Or the need to stop at nothing to avenge the death of the woman who gave birth to you?!
spock, -- back away --
kirk, You must not feel anything! It must not even compute for you! You must not have loved her at all--!
108,184   CONTINUED:                                                       184
sarek,Spock!
spock,Doctor. I am no longer fit for duty. I hereby relinquish my command on the grounds that I have been... emotionally compromised. Please note the time and date in the ship's log.
scotty,I like this ship. It's exciting.
mccoy,"Congratulations, Jim. Now we've got no Captain and no first officer to goddamn replace him."
kirk,Yeah we do.
mccoy,WHAT?!
kirk,Thanks for the support!
108a,184   CONTINUED:                                                   184
uhura,I sure hope you know what you're doing.
kirk,... so do I.  Attention crew of the Enterprise.   This is James Kirk...
kirk,"I want all departments at battle stations and ready in ten minutes. Either we're going down, or they are. Kirk out."
uhura,I want some answers.
109,187   CONTINUED:                                                     187
kirk,"-- yeah, you know that's complicated --"
uhura,Do I look simple to you?!
sulu,"I'm a PhD in astrophysics, I think I can handle it -- how'd you get back?"
chekov,You vant us to trust you but you von't tell us the truth?
kirk,"No. No, I won't-- hey, I'm the Captain now! I don't have to tell you anything! Now listen: we need to figure out a way to catch up and get to Nero's ship."
sulu,There's not a chance. They're gonna be in geosynchronous orbit around Earth in ten minutes. We'll never make it.
mccoy,"Even if we could, you can't go in guns blazing, not with their technology, that's suicide."
kirk,Then we find a way to get on that ship and steal the black hole device away from them.
scotty,Well you can forget transwarp. No way to predict the Narada's position from here.
kirk,Uhura: anything from Captain Pike?
uhura,No... I've been monitoring all channels.
110,188   CONTINUED:                                                       188
sarek,"You must not punish yourself.  Speak your mind, Spock."
spock,That would be unwise.
sarek,What is necessary is always wise.
spock,I feel as conflicted as I once was. As a child. Have I made so little progress?
sarek, And not only because you are all I have left of her.
spock,I feel anger. For the one who took her life. An anger I cannot stop.
sarek,I believe she would say... do not try to.  I married her because I loved her.
chekov,"Keptin Kirk?    Excuse me, plees, could I...?"
111,189   CONTINUED:                                                      189
kirk,"Yes, Chekov-- you don't need to ask permission to--"
chekov,"Based on the Narada's course from Vulcan, I've projected that Nero will travel past Saturn. If we could drop out of warp behind one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan, the magnetic distortion from the planet's rings will make us invisible to Nero's sensors. We could follow him to Earth by staying in his blind spot."
kirk,What blind spot?
chekov,"Its exhaust wake. If we adjust our shield frequencies, they shouldn't detect us."
mccoy,Wait a minute-- anyone understand this kid? How old are you?
chekov,"I am seventeen, Sir, how old are you?"
mccoy,We're all old enough to shave here.
kirk,"I won't order you to do that, Mr. Spock."
spock,Romulans and Vulcans share a common ancestry. Our cultural similarities will make it easier for me to access their ship's computer to locate the device. 
112,189   CONTINUED:                                                   189
kirk,Then I'm coming with you.
spock," I would cite regulation, but I know you will simply ignore it."
kirk,"See, we're getting to know each other."
ayel,The men and I have discussed this. What we are about to do.  We have to turn the ship around. We can save our home.
113,191   CONTINUED:                                                            191
nero,"There is no need, Ayel.   To threaten me.  I understand."
sulu,"Mr. Chekov, transfer manual control to the Captain's chair."

chekov,"Aye.  I've projected the parabolic course you must follow. If you deviate by so much as a meter, we will be detected."
sulu,Give me one quarter impulse burst for five seconds and I'll do the rest with thrusters. On my mark. Three... two... one... fire.
sulu,All stop in three... two... one...
chekov, No sign they've detected us --
scotty," Well done, Mr. Sulu."
115,198   CONTINUED:                                                         198
kirk,"Whatever happens Mr. Sulu, if you feel you have a tactical advantage fire on that ship. Even if we're still aboard. It's an order."
sulu,Yessir.   Good luck.
uhura,We'll be monitoring your frequency...
spock,"Thank you, Nyota."
kirk,Her first name is...
spock,I have no comment on the matter.
scotty,"If there's any common sense to their ship design, I'll be puttin' ya in a cargo bay, shouldn't be a soul in sight."

romulan helmsman,The plasma drill is repaired and fully deployed.

uhura,Communications and transporter inoperative --
sulu,They're on their own now.
spock,"What you refer to as the ""Red Matter Device"" is in the main hangar -- and I've located Captain Pike."
kirk,Is he alive?
spock,Unknown.

computer voice,Voice print and face recognition analysis enabled.
kirk,"Spock, you'll be piloting the ship alone."
spock,"Which may be problematic, as I am unfamiliar with this ship's design."
computer voice,"Welcome back, Ambassador Spock."
kirk, Wow.   That's weird.
spock,Computer: what is your manufacturing origin?
computer voice,"Stardate 2397, commissioned by the Vulcan Science Academy."

spock, Captain -- what are you doing?
kirk," We show them compassion-- it may be the only way to earn peace with Romulus. It's logic, Spock! I thought you'd like that."
spock,"No, not really, not this time."
nero,I would rather suffer the death of Romulus a thousand times than accept assistance from you.
kirk,You got it.  Lock phasers! Fire everything we've got!
kirk,"Kirk to Engineering: get us out of here, Scotty!"

spock prime,I am not... our father.
spock,... Fascinating.

spock prime," Because you needed each other. Opposing yet complimentary opposites. It was that balance between us -- I should say you and Kirk -- that often made the impossible, possible."
spock,... it was a test?
spock prime, I'm in no position to pass judgment... my actions have robbed you of much. I could not also deprive you the revelation of all you can accomplish together... of a friendship that will define you both in ways you cannot yet realize.
spock,How did you persuade him to keep your secret?
spock prime,I inferred universe-ending paradoxes would ensue should he break his promise.
spock,You lied.
spock prime,I implied.
spock,A gamble...
spock prime,An act of faith. One I hope you'll repeat in the future.

spock,"My future cannot be determined by your past. We are one, but not the same."
spock prime,Then I ask that you do yourself a favor. Put away logic. Do what feels right. The world you've inherited lives in the shadow of incalculable devastation... but there's no reason you must face it alone.
