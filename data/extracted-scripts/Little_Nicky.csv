Speaker,Dialogue
peeper, Showtime!
scottie,Hello?
peeper,"Hello, Scottie.  Why don't you go downstairs like a good boy and let your mother freshen up."
scottie,Who is this?
peeper,Just a little birdie.  A birdie who wants to see if your mother's panties match her bra.
mother,Oh my G-D Scottie.  Is there a man up our tree?
peeper,Tell her no.  Tell her it's just a big bird.
peeper,Am I in hell?
gatekeeper,What do you think?
nicky, Hey...
nicky,"Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!"
cassius,I knew it.  He's finally retiring.
adrian,I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
human dartboard,Aaaah!
cassius,"If the old man picks me to take over Hell, I'll keep the torture going twenty four seven.  No breaks."
adrian,Well Dad says it's the breaks that make the torture.  You have to let people feel a sense of relief.
human dartboard,Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
adrian,"Then again, the beauty of Dad retiring is what he says doesn't matter anymore."
cassius,I'll take that.
human dartboard,Was that really necessary?
cassius,"Hey, how's Daddy's little girl doing today?"
nicky,"Good, thanks."
cassius,Hey. Hey. Hey.  Wanna mind wrestle?
nicky,"Actually, I'll take a rain check on0"
cassius,Got ya!
nicky," Yes, you got me..."
cassius,"Got ya, again!"
nicky," Got me for sure, yes..."
cassius,Got ya!  Now here's the big finish...
nicky,Oh no.  Please Cassius...
dad,What are you boys doing?
nicky,"Nothing, Dad.  Just re-arranging the furniture."
dad,"Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?"
cassius,I forgot.
dad,Maybe this will help you remember.
nicky,"Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape.  I really think it's a masterpiece."
dad,"Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later."
dad,"Yes, Jimmy."
dad,"This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons.  I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough.  And Nicky, so...so..."
nicky,Don't worry about coming up with anything.  It's cool.
dad,"Such a sweet boy.  But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be...me."
nicky,Hallelujah.
dad,The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil.  And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet.  You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
cassius,Dad!  This is Hoyashit.
dad,"Right.  Right.  Send him in.  I'm sorry, boys.  I've got to get back to work."
adrian,"You sure about this decision, Dad?"
dad,"I'm telling you, pal, it's the right thing to do."
hitler,Holy schnit!!
cassius,"You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that."
adrian,And he's dead serious.
cassius,It's just such a slap in the face.
adrian,"Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here."
cassius,"Yeah, get out of here!  Beat it!"
adrian,"Twenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa Lucifer said, ""It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.""  Well, I'm getting tired of serving in Hell.  We need a place where we can rule."
cassius,Oh you wanna be a big man?  Bring it on!! Let's see what you got!
adrian, Could you concentrate for five seconds?
cassius,I am concentrating.  Where can we rule?
adrian,What do you think about...Earth?
cassius,You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
adrian,"Eventually, Cassius.  But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them..."
cassius,...their damned souls will be ours.
adrian,"It's our time, brother."
gatekeeper,"Hey, what are you doing?!?"
dad,"Now that was an experience.  ""You are only coming through in waves.""  That line blows my mind every time."
nicky,Definitely.
dad,"I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song.  When it's over, that mood has been altered.  Wow. Great shit.  What's next?"
nicky,"Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester."
dad,"Who is this, Metal-lick-a?"
nicky,"Metallica, Dad.  Come on."
dad,I was just playing with you.
dad,"I'm sorry.  After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline."
dan,"C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring."
dad,"In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul?  You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino."
dan,You did it for Namath.
dad,"Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that."
dan,"This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!"
dad,Now you're talking.
nicky,"You're a good devil, Dad."
dad,And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
gatekeeper,"Your highness, Cassius and Adrian have escaped from hell.  They went through the fire, and they broke it.  I think they took the New York tunnel.  I tried to stop them, but they overpowered me, sir."
dad,"Oh, boy.  Oh boy.  Calm down.  Get off your knees."
gatekeeper,"Thanks for being so understanding, your worship.  You're the man.  You've always been the man."
nicky,Coulda been much worse.
gatekeeper,That's what I'm thinkin'...
dad,"This is bad, Nicky."
nicky,How bad?
dad,"I'm gonna die, Nicky.  If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing."
lucifer,What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
dad,"Everything's fine, pop."
lucifer,Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
dad,"Please, pop, just go back to your room."
lucifer, Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
dad,"Sure, pop.  Whatever you want."
gatekeeper,"Oh, this is gonna be a whole new lifestyle for me, isn't it."
nicky,We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
dad,To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
nicky,"So go get 'em, Dad!"
dad,I'm too weak.  The process has already begun.
nicky,"So go get 'em, Jimmy!"
nicky,You're not saying it's up to me?
dad,"Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here."
nicky,Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
dad,"Here.  Get them drunk from this.  One sip and they'll be trapped inside.  Once you've got both of them, you bring the flask back through the gate."
nicky,No.  This can't be happening.
dad,"Son, just do your best."
nicky,Okay. Earth.  The Blue Marble.  This doesn't look too bad.
nicky,I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
dad,"That's a train, son.  Don't stand in front of them."
nicky,"Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one."
dad,"Please, Nicky, get back up there.  Try to hurry."
nicky,I'm Nicky.
beefy," Hey, terrific!!  Now get off the track and come with me, shitstains."
beefy,My name's Beefy.  I'm an old friend of your father's.  He's asked me to help you out.
nicky,"I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy."
beefy,It's not gonna be easy.  Your brothers can possess people.  So they probably won't look like themselves.  You have to be suspicious of everyone.
nicky,"Okay, ""bro,"" this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle.  Just slide right on in there."
beefy,"It's not me, moron."
nicky,Oh.  Sorry.
preacher,"Oh how the Lord loves you.  All his children.  God bless, Ma'am.  The Lord loves you... The Lord loves you..."
beefy,Makin' friends already.
nicky," It's freezing up here, Beefy."
beefy,"You're on Earth now, kid.  Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has.  We'll stop by K-mart.  Get you some warm clothes."
nicky,I also have this odd pain in my mid section.  Kind of a hollow feeling...
beefy,That pain is hunger.
nicky,"So far, so good.  Now what?"
beefy,Put it in your mouth.
nicky,Hey...Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
beefy,It sure is.  Now eat it up.  You're gonna need your energy.
nicky,I got energy up the ying-ying.  Let's get cracking!
gatekeeper,Hey.
nicky,That's a pretty brassiere.
gatekeeper,Thanks.
nicky,Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
gatekeeper,You got it.  Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
nicky,You got it.
nicky,From now on.  I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
beefy,Great.  Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side.  But I misplaced it.
beefy,So I found this other joint for you. But you're gonna have a roommate.
todd, Somebody's here.  Call you later.
nicky,"Hello, friend, my name is Nicky.  I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice.  Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?"
todd,"Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?"
nicky,Yes.  What is rent?
todd,"Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits."
nicky,Off limits.
todd,"Right.  And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?"
nicky,No.
todd,It's like eighty degrees in this hallway.  You from the South?
nicky,Yeah.  The deep South.
todd,Why is that funny?
nicky,I don't know.
todd,"And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed."
beefy,You'll be alright.  Go on.  Big day tomorrow.  Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
nicky,Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
todd,"Yeah, your bedroom is right over there."
cardinal,"In today's gospel, the Lord tells us who we are to live if we wish to attain the splendor of Heaven... or something like that.  Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in the Bible.  Moses this.  Moses that. Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat."
cardinal,"Ma'am, I know your son, and believe me, he was better off on drugs.  He's a bore.  At least when he was smoking hashish, he made me laugh occasionally."
young man,"After we tried for many years, the Lord finally helped my wife conceive a baby."
cardinal,"No, your best friend Fitzie helped your wife conceive a baby.  He helped her conceive it all night long."
mayor," Well, I wish I could think of something, Cardinal, but to be honest with you, I can't.  Kind of makes you wonder if there even is a Lord.  If there is any ultimate punishment for our so-called ""sins.""  Maybe we should all just have fun and do whatever the hell we want."
cardinal,Amen to that.  Let the sin begin!
nicky,This is intense!  And it happens every day?  Sometimes twice?  I gotta tip my hat to you people!
beefy,"Look, it's okay for me to shit the street.  But you gotta use a toilet."
nicky," Okay, just point me in the right direction next time."
beefy,"Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking."
nicky,"Well, let's rock and roll."
nicky,just get in the flask!
gatekeeper,Bus?
nicky,Beast.
gatekeeper, You like that?  You think that's funny?
nicky,All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
beefy,I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects.  Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
peter,Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
john,'Bout time...
peter,Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
john,What's with that guy?
peter,Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
john,"Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off."
peter,Should we wake him up?
john,Yeah.  You do it.
peter,"Rise and shine, devil guy.  Some dude just stole your shit."
nicky,Oh nooooo....
john,That way.
nicky,Iron Maiden live double disc is simply phenomenal.
peter,Did you check out the dragon mouth?
john,The Dark Prince is here.
nicky,Hey...
street vendor,"See something you like, my man?"
nicky,Yes.  I would like my flask back.
street vendor,"You callin' me a thief, my man?"
nicky,"No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask."
street vendor,"And if that is your so-called ""flask,"" how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?"
nicky, I don't know?
man,"Yeah, how much for the silver flask there?"
street vendor,"Well, that's a very special item.  The cap itself is one hundred percent plappium.  It's a value is over three thousand dollars."
man,Really.  Where's it from?
nicky,It was handcrafted in hell by Satan himself and is only to be used for the capture and containment of my blood brothers so that the firefall of Hades will burn brightly once again.
man,Really.  I think we'll let you keep it then.
street vendor,"Okay, now you gone and done it.  You done messed with my business bitch!"
nicky,"Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice.  It's making my muscles tighten."
street vendor,"Oh, you gonna go all crazy eyes on me? I'll show you some crazy eyes.  Let's get busy."
valerie,"Excuse me, does that flask belong to this man?"
street vendor, Now you callin' me a thief?  Damn.
valerie,"Look, I know you come out here and sell stolen stuff all the time.  But today, the guy you stole from just happened to walk by and bust you.  So why don't you admit today's not your day and give him his flask back?"
street vendor,Or what're you gonna do about it?  Ugly me to death?
valerie,"No, but maybe that cop over there might have something to say."
street vendor,"Aw, take your dumb-ass canteen, goofy.  And you, take your raggedy-ass clothes and find a new corner.  Before I show you what real crazy is."
valerie,Fine.  I will.
nicky,"Hey, mister.  I'll be seeing you in a few years."
valerie,That's okay.  I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it.  I hate when people take advantage of tourists.  It ruins it for the rest of us.
nicky,You think I'm a tourist?
valerie,I'm sorry.  I just assumed.  Your accent maybe.  Where are you from?
nicky,The South.
valerie,Really?
nicky,Yeah.  Deep south. 
valerie,Why are you laughing?
nicky,"I don't know, but I like it.  Say.  Your glasses are nice.  They make your eyes look sparkly and big.  It's fun to look at them."
valerie,My dad's an optometrist.
nicky,"My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart."
valerie,I'm sorry.  It's really tough when your parents get older.
nicky,"If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do."
valerie,"Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out."
nicky,"Here, have a Popeye's.  This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'."
valerie,That's alright.  I already ate lunch.  I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
nicky,Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
valerie,If you want to.
nicky,Want to?  A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
valerie,"""Octopus people?"""
nicky,"Uh, it's a deep south expression."
nicky,It's freezing my hands.
valerie,"It's not that cold.  Here, let me wrap it."
preacher,Why do you taunt me with your darkness?! Your evil is stinking up our streets! We're all gonna die!
valerie,This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
nicky,"I have an apartment.  I don't remember exactly where.  My dog knows, though."
valerie, You have a dog?  What kind?
nicky,"I'm not sure.  I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts."
beefy,"Remember, it's not the size of the boat, it's the motion of the ocean."
girl dog,Just finish.
valerie,I'd love to have a dog.  But I go to school full time.  It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
nicky,School?
valerie,"Parsons School of Design.  I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty."
nicky,"What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?"
valerie,My perfume?
nicky,"Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach.  Is that normal?"
valerie,"Sometimes, sure."
nicky,Good.  I was concerned.
gatekeeper,Doesn't sound very good behind there.  I hope Nicky's kicking some ass on Earth.
lucifer,"You know, I was the one who created Hell."
gatekeeper,"I know, your wickedness."
lucifer,"I started slow, though.  For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration.  She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex.  I said I'll take the soup."
gatekeeper,"It's Stanley, sir."
lucifer,Nothing.  No mountains.  No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot.  It wasn't even called Hell.
gatekeeper,"What was it called, sir."
lucifer,Boogerland!
gatekeeper,"That's nice, Grandpa.  Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?"
lucifer,"I can't enjoy anything.  I go fishing. I catch nothing.  I go to orgies, I catch everything..."
peeper,I deserve this!
kid,I just stole twenty-five bucks off the bar.
kid,I had five!  I'm so wasted.
adrian,"When an adult goes to Hell, that's terrific.  But when a child goes... that's why I'm in this business."
nicky,"So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?"
valerie,"Basically, yeah."
nicky,Wow.  Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
valerie,You know what's nice about you?  You just seem happy being yourself.  You don't try to act cool.
nicky,"Thanks much.  You know what's nice about you, Valerie?"
valerie,What?
nicky,"Your juicy, heart-shaped ass."
valerie,What was that?
nicky, I...I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
valerie,You're a jerk.
valerie,What the hell's your problem?
peter,Check this out.  The number of the beast.
dan rather,"Reverberations from Arch-Decon Donnelly's shocking speech are still being felt throughout the city.  Today, some disgruntled cast members of the play CATS broke the fourth wall in a most hostile manner."
dan rather,...But even that does not come close to what happened today on Live with Regis and Kathy Lee.
regis,"So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off..."
kathy lee,"Oh, that's terrible, Reege..."
regis,So I followed him...
kathy lee,You followed him?
regis,"I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat."
kathy lee,You keep a bat under your seat?
regis,"Recently, yes!  So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy!  Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?"
kathy lee,"Yes, great movie..."
regis,I was DeNiro!
beefy,Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
nicky,What can I do about it?
beefy,You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
nicky,Nobody's as evil as my brothers.  Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
beefy,Go get a soda out of the fridge.
nicky,But those are my roommate's sodas...
beefy," ""But those are my roommate's sodas..."" Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?"
nicky,Release the evil?
beefy,"I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores."
todd,What are you doing?
bill walton,"What an odd game, folks.  The powerhouse 85-0 Harlem Globetrotters, who normal run circles around the 0-85 Nationals, seem to be struggling to find their groove in front of their hometown fans."
ref,"He's walking, get him a bus!"
bill walton,"Oh, another awful call.  There is no way that was travelling."
cornrows,"What's with all these crazy calls?  You gotta watch that shit, we haven't lost a game in 53 years."
ref,Technical foul!
nicky,That guy in the striped shirt snaps his fingers like someone I know...
todd,A black guy?
nicky,"If it's Cassius, yes."
globetrotter fan,"Get your head out your ass, ref!  The kids came to see the Globetrotters win."
ref,"Oh, so you wanna lip off to me? Unsportsmanlike conduct on the big mouth in the Globetrotter's shirt.  Take ten points off for the Globetrotters."
bill walton,"In all my years of basketball, I was never so happy to hear a halftime buzzer.  Folk, I'm afraid if the second half doesn't get any better, I expect a full scale riot."
court announcer,"It's time for the Globetrotter's halftime half-court heave throw, where one lucky fan will have a shot at ten thousand dollars!"
miguel,I ain't goin' out there and taking the shot.  These people have gone crazy.
nicky,I'll take the shot.
peter,Look who's back from the dead.
john,"Six, six, six, pick up sticks."
todd,What's Nicky doing down there?
beefy,Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
todd,Did you just talk?
beefy,No.
court announcer,You better win these people some free pizza.  Looks like they're about to start killing each other.
nicky,Release the evil.
bill walton,"I think that ball just blew up.  And yes, my hair is aflame."
nicky, Could I get another ball?
ref,Get that crap outta here!
nicky,"Listen up, New York.  Your souls are in great danger..."
bill walton,I think it's safe to say we're all rooting for this bizarre and hideous looking man.
crowd,Nicky!  Nicky!  Nicky!
nicky,"You know, Dad got very sick when you left."
ref,I heard.  I'm glad he's dying.  It's my turn now.
beefy,"Take him to the hole, Nicky.  I mean, woof!  Woof!"
nicky,Never doubt my skills.
cornrows,"Damn, I gotta learn how to do that."
ref,That's nuts.  When'd you learn that shit?
nicky,"Sorry, Cassius.  Maybe it was the super devil juice Dad gave me.  HE thought I might need it for just such an occasion."
regis,Super devil juice?  Give it over.  Let's go best two out of three.
nicky, No.  No way.  Dad said it was only for me.
todd,"So your father's the devil, you're a talking dog sent from Hell, and you guys are who?"
peeper,Just a couple of big fans of Nicky and the work his Dad does.
john,"By the way, Nicky.  Check this out."
nicky,Absolutely nothing.  The Blizzard always came straight with his messages.  But wrap your minds around this one.
voice,I command you in the name of the Lucifer to spread the blood of the innocent.
john,No wonder your uncle's so weird...
todd,I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
peter,"Oh, I dumped a fat sack of reefer in the mix.  Tried to spice up the bash."
nicky,What's reefer?
john,Come on.  One more time.
nicky,"Not again, fellas.  It kind of hurts."
peter,Please.  You got to.
nicky, All right...
beefy,"I used to get baked like this with my first girlfriend, Heather.  We'd get so stoned she would forget I was a dog."
john,She was human?
beefy,"Actually, she was a sewer rat.  Man, that pissed my parents off."
john,"I dated a Japanese girl once.  My parents disapproved.  Not cause she's Japanese, but cause she was only fifteen."
nicky,I'm only fifteen...thousand years old.
todd,I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough.  And she needed that.
john,"By she, do you mean he?"
todd,No.
beefy,Busted. 
peter,"How you feelin' over there, Satan Abdul Jabar?"
nicky,"A little strange.  I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie."
todd,Why?  Did she hurt you?  Do you miss her?  Need a shoulder to cry on?
john,"Easy, Liberace."
todd,"Oh, would you grow up."
nicky,We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
beefy,Maybe you love her.  But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
peter,"Me, too.  We're gonna get going."
todd,You guys want to stay?  I have a futon in my bedroom.
john,"That's a big pass, Elton John."
peter,"We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now.  Wanna come, Nicky?"
nicky,No thanks.  I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
john,"Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then.  Later on."
nicky,"See ya, fellas."
todd,That is the most frightening thing I have ever seen.
nicky,Todd.  Which way to the Parson's School of Design?
nicky, Coconuts...
student,Hello.
nicky,You smell like coconuts.
student,"It's ""Comptoir Sud Pacific.""  Makes me feel like a hula girl.  Which is kinda what I'm going for.  Wanna come in?"
nicky,No thanks.  I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
student,"Valerie Doran?  Two floors up, one window over."
nicky,"Thanks, much.  Good luck with the genital tucking."
student,I don't need luck.  I'm good.
nicky,Adrian?
student,Andrew.
nicky,Hey.
valerie,Nicky?  Oh my G-d.  Stay right there.
nicky,Oh that stings!  My eyes are on fire!
valerie,What were you thinking coming here?
nicky,"I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison."
valerie,"Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry!"
nicky,Valerie?
valerie,Are you dead?
nicky,No.
valerie,What are you doing?
nicky,I think I'm floating.
valerie,Why would you be floating?
nicky,I don't know.  Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
valerie,Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now?  Because I am.
nicky,I can't see you but I can smell you. And you make me feel alive in a way I've never felt before.
student,"You got the wrong window again, man."
nicky,"Oh.  Sorry, Andrew.  Valerie?"
valerie,"I'm over here, Nicky!  To the left."
nicky,"That wasn't me.  I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian.  He's the one who call you a gross pig."
valerie,"What do you mean, ""possessed?"""
nicky,Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
valerie,Yes...
nicky,"Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years.  Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad..."
valerie,"... ""The Devil?""..."
nicky,"...to decompose.  And I love my  Dad very much.  So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and...well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you."
valerie,"Okay, now I get that ""deep south"" joke."
nicky,You gotta believe me.  You gotta believe in the butterflies.
valerie,"Okay, I do.  Get back up here."
valerie,This is amazing.
preacher,The hellbeast is above us.  He's invading our skies!  We're all gonna die!  We're all gonna die!
valerie,He's kind of ruining the mood.
nicky,Let me take care of that.
preacher,We're all gonna die!
valerie,Can we go fly over Central Park?
nicky,"Next time.  Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine."
valerie,We're going to Jersey?
nicky,East Rutherford.
nicky,I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
valerie," ""Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."""
nicky,My dog was right.  I'm in love with you.
nicky, Moo ya san jie bay!
nicky,What's going on here?
nicky,Ow...what was that for?
bum,Fifty million dollars.
nicky,Release the evil.
nicky,"I seem to be in trouble, Beefy."
beefy,"The shit has hit the fan, kid.  Take a look."
todd,Been breaking all morning.
dan rather,"At a news conference earlier today, Chief of Police Andy Shaifer gave this beleaguered city its latest dose of bad news.  He revealed that the man who caused a sensation at basketball arena last night is no hero... he is, in fact, a mass murderer."
nicky,I didn't murder anybody
beefy,Look.  You were really high.  Things happen.
nicky,"I was with Valerie, I swear.  This is Adrian's work.  I've got to find him."
beefy,I think you're looking at him.
guy," My name's Nicky, and I'm gonna kill all you suckers for no reason!"
nicky,This is baloney!
beefy,"He superimposed your head onto ""Scarface."""
todd,...which is by far DePalma's best work...
nicky,I'm not Nicky.  I'm not home!  I don't live here!
peter,"Dude, it's us.  Let us in."
john,There's like a total mob scene coming this way.
nicky,I thought for sure I gave 'em the slip.
todd,Looks like they're following a giant trail of bug shit.
peter,"What'll we do now, Beefy?"
beefy,"I don't know, this is a little out of my league."
john,"What would your dad do, Nicky?"
nicky,Good idea...kill me.
peter,Dude.  Seriously?
nicky,Yes.  I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon.  Okay.  Do me.  I command you.
nicky,That just hurt a lot.
todd,I've always wanted to kill someone.  Can I do it?
john,Look at Queen Latifah steppin' up.
todd,"Die, Grandma, die!"
lucifer,"Royal flush, you lose.  Off with the bra."
nicky,"Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me.  He's always a step ahead.  What am I gonna do?"
dad,"What are you gonna do?  Look at me, Nicky!  I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear..."
nicky,"Uh, I'll do my best, Dad.  Do you have any advice at all for me?"
dad,"I can't hear you, Nicky.  I can't hear anything!"
dad,Put it back on my head.  I'm falling apart here.
peter,You sure you're down with this?
john,Little nervous.  Wanna puke.
peter,We know where to find Nicky.
john,Sure do.  You got what we want?
peter,"Fifty million bones, bro."
peter,"Excellent.  But I gotta warn you, man. He's not human."
john,We think he's the son of Satan.
bag lady,"Hey, watch it!  Who do you think you are?"
todd,Where is he?  He's late.
beefy,"He'll be here.  Just keep your cool, kid."
todd,You guys.  That was so uncool.
peter,We thought the son of Satan would understand a move like this.
adrian,Ta-da.  So what time is my brother expected back?
john,Noon...
peter,"So even though you're not really the chief, we still get the rest of the cash, right bro?"
adrian,You know what you'll get?  An indescribably horrific torture administered by demons for the rest of eternity.
john,But what about the cash?  Can we keep it or what?
adrian,"Sure, why not?"
lady," Food stamps? They should call 'em ""dude stamps."" Cause ever time I get one, some dude takes it away..."
john,No thanks...but we'll take that bottle of booze. 
lady,Hey...that's mine.
peter,"Beat it, ya freak."
john,Schnapps...
peter, Peppermint...alright.
john,Wanna hit?
peter,Drink up.  Here's to fifty million clams.
adrian,To the defilement of Earth and the corruption of its people.
peter,"Whatever.  Knock it back, grab Nicky and let's get outta this hell-hole."
adrian,It is awfully hot down here.  How do you manage to stay so cool?
john,"Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that...in, uh...er, science magazine."
adrian,This liquid will probably quench my thirst.  Cool me off.
peter,Definitely.
john,And give you a good buzz.
adrian,Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
john,Uh.  No it won't?
adrian,"Oh, Nicky, I've missed you.  Come on out and say hello..."
john,Urr...uggg...errr...
adrian," I'm calling you out, brother..."
adrian,"Hello, Cassius."
adrian,"You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan."
adrian,But Cassius could use some company for the rest of eternity.  So get in the flask.
cop,"Oh, he's gotta pee."
todd,"Run, Beefy!  Run!"
nicky,I won't drink.  You can't make me.
adrian,"Of course I can.  Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going."
nicky,Let her go.
adrian,I hear a train coming.  Drink.
valerie,Don't do it.
nicky,"I have to, Valerie."
adrian,Ahhh!
beefy,Now that hurt the both of us.
nicky,Valerie!!!
adrian,See you in Hell!
angel,"Oh. My. G-d.  I can't believe you're here.  Welcome.  Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now."
christa,So excited.
jenna,She really is.
nicky,That's terrific.  Now could you ladies point me to the Black Palace?  I should check in with my dad...
angel,"I'm sorry, you're just so cute."
jenna,Do you have any idea where you are right now?
nicky,"The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks..."
angel,Maybe try the opposite of that.
nicky,My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat.  Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
angel, A mountain goat?  That's really sweet.
nicky,My mom wasn't a goat?
angel,Try an angel.
nicky,An angel?
angel,Unh-huh.  Which would make you half angel.
nicky,Wow.  What...what did she look like?
angel,"Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair."
jenna,"I'm sorry, but you just had the sweetest look on your face."
christa,You're gonna be so happy she did that.
nicky, How come you're not older?
angel,"Angels don't get any older, son."
jenna,"I can't believe you just called him ""son."""
angel,Oh my G-d.  This is so wild.
dad,"I can't see shit.  You're all still here, right?"
dad lips,Yea!  I can't believe little Nicky came through.
adrian,Where's Nicky?
adrian,I came through that gate alone.
dad,Boooo.
adrian,Somebody explain what's going on.
gatekeeper,You'll get nothing out of me.
adrian,Perhaps a titty twister will loosen your lips.
gatekeeper,The only way to save your dad is for you and your brothers to pass through the gates at the same time before he deteriorates completely.
adrian,How much time does Dad have before that happens?
gatekeeper,Thirty minutes.  And then whoever claims his throne will have unimaginable power.
lucifer,All boobs and no balls.
adrian,Thirty minutes.  Hmmm.  I hope you don't mind if I take a seat while I wait for you.
dad lips,Ahhh!
lucifer,I don't get no respect.
adrian,Ten thousand years.  And I never once got to sit here.
dad,"Hell's gonna bust wide open.  Demons, get him out of the chair!"
adrian,"Ah-ah.  Not so fast, demons.  There are a couple of million evil souls on Earth ready to be harvested.  Anyone interested?"
nicky,"Are you Adrian and Cassius' mom, too?"
christa,"No, their mother's weren't angels."
angel,I think they were hookers or strippers or something really porno like...
chubbs,"Holly, Jenna, Christa. Time for your Mambo lesson."
angel,"Oh, Chubbs.  I totally spaced.  I'm so sorry.  I have company.  It's my son, Nicky.  My son.  Can you believe it?"
chubbs,"Wow, that's terrific."
angel,"Nicky, this is Chubbs.  He used to be a golf pro, but up here he's the dopest dance instructor."
chubbs,You mambo?
nicky,I don't think so.
chubbs,"Remember, it's all in the hips.  It's all in the hips."
nicky,Where did you meet my father?
angel,"It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer."
christa,"I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris."
angel,Try four and a half.  At first I totally didn't like him.
jenna,He was really conceited.
angel,"But I don't know, he was funny, he made me laugh, and I hate to say it but he had a really nice body."
nicky,And that made you want to make a baby with him?
angel,"Well, I really wasn't thinking about making a baby at the time!"
nicky,"Well tell her I said ""hi"" back."
angel,I'll call her later.
christa,"You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life."
jenna,That was so cool.
angel,That's why you came up to Heaven instead of Hell.  Self-sacrifice automatically gets you here.
nicky,How did you see me?
angel,We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth.  Look.
adrian,Welcome to the party.  It's so nice to see all of you here.
dad lips,"I was a good Devil, wasn't I?"
gatekeeper,Absolutely.
dad lips,I tried to do some interesting stuff...
gatekeeper,I don't know how you came up with some of it.
dad lips,Really?  That means a lot to me.
adrian,I'm very proud of you.  You've taken to sin with minimal prompting.
adrian,"Well, I have some news."
cardinal,There is most definitely a Hell!  And you're all going there when you die! Which will happen in about fifteen minutes.
preacher,We really are gonna die!
peter,This don't look good.
john,Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
todd,"They castrated him.  He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke."
beefy,I can't screw.  I can't screw.
nicky,Valerie's crying!
angel,She's so nice.
christa,"She goes to Parson's, right?"
angel,I would totally love to go there.  But I hear it's really hard to get in.
nicky,I gotta help her.  I gotta help Dad.  I gotta help everybody.
angel,"Yeah, you do..."
adrian,Soon you will see things more horrible than you can even imagine.
adrian,"Not that horrible, but still pretty bad."
adrian,Covered in bees!
nicky,But how can I win?  Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
angel,"Stronger, yes.  Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have."
nicky,A speech impediment?
angel,"No, you have the inner light.  You can totally use it.  It's the best power of all.  And in case you get in real bad trouble, G-d told me to give you this."
nicky,What is it?
angel,"I'm not a hundred percent on that.  G-d said when the time comes, you'll know what to do."
christa,G-d's so smart.
jenna,The smartest.
angel,"Well, goodbye...for now.  Can I just do this?"
friend,Totally.
nicky,"Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?"
angel,It would be so okay.
nicky,"Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane."
nicky,Release...the good.
demon,Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
todd,One thing I really regret is never having experimented sexually.
peter,"You mean, like, experiment with a Bunsen Burner?  What are you talking about?"
john,He means getting it on with someone like that freak.
todd,His name is Andrew.  I know that guy.
john,"Of course you do, Tommy Tune."
adrian,"You know, from this angle, you're kind of cute."
valerie,You think so?  Why don't you come a little closer and I'll show you a better angle.
adrian,Yummy.
todd,"Oh my G-d, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit."
beefy,"That turn you on there, RuPaul?"
adrian,Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
john,You want a queen?  Got one right here.
nicky,"Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask."
adrian,Is this a joke?
nicky,No.  It's the inner light.  And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
reformed demon, It's true!
nicky,"Okay, Adrian, you've left me with no choice."
nicky,Love lifts me up where I belong.
adrian,"Not bad, little brother.  Let's see what you've got."
angel,I totally had to do that.
nicky,"Now I'm asking you nicely, get in the flas..."
adrian,Absolutely not.
henry winkler,Oh no.
adrian,"Goodbye, Nicky."
valerie,Nicky!
demon,"Kill him, Adrian."
valerie,Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
nicky,From my dad's side of the family.
adrian,What?  No tongue?
valerie, Nicky. Nicky.
ozzy,"Hello, New York."
valerie,"Put him in, Ozzy."
valerie,"Grand Central, Nicky.  Start running."
john,He'll never make it.
peter,You gotta kill yourself.
nicky,I'll just go to Heaven.
beefy,No if you do something bad right before you die.
henry winkler,"Aw, man, not again."
nicky,"Sorry, Henry.  Release the Evil."
valerie,I love you.
nicky,I love you.
angel,"Okay, you just saw my son save the universe.  Right?!"
dad,"You came through, Nicky."
nicky,"I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad."
dad,"You're back in Hell now, kid.  There's no butterflies here.  If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth."
nicky,What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
dad,"Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting.  That's right, you heard me, Holly.  I'm still in love with you."
angel,Oh my G-d.  He's totally talking about me.
dad,And don't think I forgot about how crazy you get after a few daiquiris.
friend,That guy is still a horn dog.
dad,"Listen, I got down low.  Your mom's got up high.  You take care of the middle."
nicky,"I will, Dad.  But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my...home sweet home..."
lucifer,Let me handle that.
hitler,Holy Schnit!
lady,Oh...what an uncommonly beautiful baby.
valerie,Thank yo.
lady,Such a little angel.
beefy,"Only a quarter, ma'am."
nicky,"Zachariah, say you're sorry."
baby zachariah, Sorry.
preacher,He has spilled his seed!  He is multiplying!  Beware the progeny of the unholy union!  We're all gonna die!
