Speaker,Dialogue
television announcer,"Peter Vincent's ""FRIGHT NIGHT."" The family DOG is up on the coffee table eating what's left of a fast food burger and fries, still in the box."
distant voice,"Get off her!! More voices yelling, something being thrown. An ugly domestic scene. We creep down a dark hall toward a cracked door, light seeps through the opening -- it SLAMS OPEN and ADAM, 17, crashes toward us. He's nice-looking, a little nerdy -- and he's in a blind terror. We get a glimpse of the horrible scene behind the door. A teen girl's room -- the sound of flesh ripping. We see a pale arm on the ground, shaking violently, as if something is tearing and tugging at the body attached to it. We bolt away with ADAM, who we now see is blood splattered, as he races UPSTAIRS. A PHONE CRADLE is ripped out of the wall, which Adam nearly falls over."
adam,"Come on, come on, come on... He gets it. But the GUN HAS A GUN LOCK. Adam has to dig in his dead father's pockets for his keys. Adam starts to cry."
charlie," You want me to take you apart, huh? Charlie's 17 and has the slightly awkward feel of someone who just recently came into his body and good looks. He's a wry, thoughtful kid who's enjoying -- but not quite trusting -- a sudden surge in popularity."
doris,"Nothing doing, huh?"
charlie,"The thing's got no ambition.  Can I -- uh, give you a hand?"
doris,"I got it. Thanks. She walks away -- her sweatpants have the word ""LUCKY"" across the butt. He watches her go appreciatively. Doesn't notice his mom, JANE, struggling to pull their own cans to the curb."
jane,"Don't leer at the neighbors, kid. Jane, 40's, attractive and frazzled, wears a REAL ESTATE brokers blazer. Charlie wheels his bike back to the curb."
charlie,She's the one who put a word on her butt. I'm just reading it. Jane eyes a LARGE DUMPSTER FULL OF CONCRETE that sits in front of their NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR'S YARD.
jane,Is he ever going to move that thing?
charlie,"You need to get over it, Mom."
charlie,"School's great, actually."
jane,Amy?
charlie,Good. Hasn't dumped me yet. He says this like he's surprised. Jane nods. Getting it.
jane,That'll teach you to get so tall and handsome.
charlie,Are you reading those books again? The Power of Whatever the Hell? She laughs. He glances at the DUMPSTER.
jane,"It's an eyesore. I'm trying to convince people to move in, not join the legions leaving town--"
charlie,"If you say ""mortgage crisis"" again I'm getting a new mom."
jane,The guy moves in and puts a giant trash can in his yard! When the Perry's lived there-- Charlie has heard this before. It's a common refrain.
charlie,The Perry's were the greatest neighbors ever. But they moved. I thought you were happy their place finally sold.
jane, He's not digging a pool. Where do you think all that concrete's coming from?
charlie,You're spying on the guy now?
jane,"He's thirteen feet from our house. That's not spying, that's observing. A BEETLE CONVERTIBLE pulls up. AMY drives and her two hot friends, CARA and BEE, sit in the back."
amy,"Hi, Mrs. Brewster."
jane,"Hi honey. Hi girls. ANY, 16, is a stunner. And she's as cool as she is beautiful -- the girl every other guy in school would die to be with."
charlie,Okay.
jane,"I'm tired of making excuses, Charlie. If you don't want to talk to him, would you please tell him?"
charlie,Kinda defeats the purpose. He gets to AMY and the girls. Amy glances at the dirt bike.
amy,"Still can't get the bike started, huh?"
charlie,Wow. No faith.
amy,So you don't need a ride. Amy calls his bluff and starts to drive off. Charlie grabs his backpack and RACES after her.
charlie,"No, hey, stop-- She laughs, stops the car. Charlie tries to jump in and she drives again."
on jane,"Watching them drive off, gone in a cloud of teen spirit."
bee,"Takes a man to wear purple, Chuck."
amy,Charlie.
bee,"Chuck likes it when I call him Chuck, right Chuck? Intimidated by these girls, he tries to form a witty retort."
charlie,"It's -- they're not -- that's, like, puce? That's a macho puce."
cara,Can you stop someplace? I'm severely under-caffeinated.
amy," Did you see the poster for the formal? The theme is ""Hope""?"
bee,I know. They asked me to be on the committee again but I was like --
charlie,"Did you suggest ""Despair?"" Nobody would see that coming. Or -- global warming? Everybody has to wear tin foil."
amy," Did you go last year? We basically did the whole thing, Bee and me."
bee, Chuck was still under his rock. We're so glad you crawled out.
cara,Caffeine!? Hello!
charlie,I have Econ first period. Amy takes her hand off his leg. Charlie notices.
cara,Charrrliiieeeee.
cara,"Thank you, Jesus. Amy catches Charlie looking at his watch, fidgeting."
amy,"You're not going to flunk for missing Econ, Brain."
charlie,"Brain? I -- what? No, I'm-- But she's already walking away."
amy,"Five minutes. He watches her move off, anxious and smitten."
amy,On time. You stress too much.
charlie,I wasn't worried.
amy,You were doing your worried thing.
charlie,I was? I have a -- what's my--
bee,Doods. Looking massive.
mark," Seriously? A Mochachino? You can't ride with the girls anymore. You let them brush your hair, My Pretty Pony? Mark grabs the cup away from him. Starts drinking it."
bee," Chuck's secure, aren't you? We see that Ben is also wearing PUMA's. Different design. It's a thing. Charlie shows his off -- he's secure."
charlie,Puce.
ben,Fuck yeah.
charlie,"Yeah. Hey. Come here.  You know, the formal. Don't think I wasn't going to ask you, because I thought it was an obvious go. Together. Hope, puppies, kittens, the whole deal. You and me."
charlie,"Right. I knew that. MARK and BEN enjoy the view as the girls move off. Wow. Mark, incredulous, says to Charlie:"
mark,Did you find a frickin' Genie lamp man? Make a sacrifice to the hot ass Gods? How do you get that?
charlie,"Game, my friend. Rock solid. Charlie moves off. And even though he's playing it off, we see that Mark's hit a nerve. This hot girlfriend thing is a bitch. Mark calls after him--"
mark,You don't even have a car!
teacher,Ben Wegner?
ben,Here.
teacher,Adam Noris? Nothing. Teacher looks around.
mark,Miss Granada. Geometry.
charlie,Holy crap. Where did you get that?
mark,"She's hard up, man. Equations don't keep you warm at night. They stop, see EVIL ED approaching. This amuses Mark and Ben. But Charlie's uncomfortable -- wants to bolt."
ben,"I think ""it's"" going to talk to us."
mark,"""It's"" going to talk to Brewster."
charlie," What's the deal, man?"
ed,Alone. Ed stares Charlie down. A beat. Ben and Mark bust out laughing. Mark looks at Charlie.
mark,Just the two of you. That's sweet. He can school you in the ways of geek-douchery.
ed,"It's important. ""Brewster."" The way Ed says his name is enough to propel Charlie into action. He grabs Ed and pulls him aside. Mark and Ben watch with interest -- out of earshot. Ed's tone is dire, serious as a heart attack."
charlie,"What do you mean, he's missing?"
ed,"I keep trying him -- nothing. No texts, no phone. And he's not the only one who's gone. You heard roll call."
charlie,So kids aren't coming to school. What do you want me to do about it?
ed,"Meet me at his house after school. We'll check around. See what's up, if he's okay."
charlie,I can't after school. I'm busy.
ed,I don't think you get what I'm
charlie,"Look, do we have to do this here? Ed can't believe it. Charlie's totally blowing him off. He starts to lose it, raises his voice--"
ed,"What, am I not even suppose to speak to you now?--"
charlie,Keep it down. Don't spaz--
ed,"It's so horrible! Crossing the streams! Will High School as we know it cease to exist?! Ed glances at Mark and Ben, who still watch from a distance."
ed,Or how your first sexual experience was with an Electra figurine--
charlie,No. No.
ed,Then be my backup.
ed,"Don't be late. Moves off. Charlie sees the guys watching him. A beat. He shrugs like ""I have no idea what that was about..."""
amy,You know what I want? For dinner?
charlie,"You're eating right now, you know. As you speak. You literally just forced me to get you a smoothie so large they named a planet after it--"
charlie,I -- watched you. But not in a creepy way. Charlie winces a little. It sounds creepy.
amy,"So don't judge. You don't want me to burn my big ole' booty off, do you? Charlie, on impulse, stops her -- kisses her."
charlie,I don't know you're just...
amy,What?
amy,Wow.
charlie,Look at Mom. She's
amy,"Damn right. If he followed her home, you have to let her keep him. Amy laughs -- almost skips toward them, milking the moment."
adam,"Charlie. I'm in front of Adam's. Remember the videos we all made back when? You and me and Adam, bro? In tights. Want your pals to get a load of that?"
jane,".so not a pool, what's the work you're doing?"
jerry,Foundation problems. I had to rip up half the basement.
jane,These houses were built practically overnight. I'm never surprised when they come apart.
jane,"Jerry, this is my son Charlie. And his -- do we say girlfriend now?"
amy," Hi. I'm Amy. He can't help but give Amy an appreciative once-over. She enjoys it, but pulls away and moves closer to Charlie. Charlie notices the exchange -- the way this dude oozes manliness. Doesn't like it one bit. He shakes Jerry's hand a little too firmly. Lowers his voice a bit."
charlie,Hey.
jane,"Jerry's our new neighbor. The Perry place. He's ""handy."""
amy, No kidding.
jerry,"Sorry about the mess, man. I was just telling your mom I'll have the dumpster gone next week."
charlie,Doesn't bother me.
jane,Jerry does night construction on the strip.
jerry, You play ball? I'm always looking for a pick up game.
jane,"It's more of a collector thing. The shoes. He's obsessed.  They sleep on sidewalks to get them. Charlie looks at Jane, thanks for embarrassing me."
jerry,Well -- they're bold. I like them. Jerry looks back at Jane. A little flirtatious.
jane,Be neighborly.
jerry,"A drink, something. It hangs there, waiting for an invitation. Jane just smiles."
jane,You bet. And thank you so much. For the help.
jerry,"Least I could do. Jane, Amy and Charlie walk toward the house. Jerry moves off. Amy looks at Jane, amazed."
amy,Why did you blow him off? Oh my God!
jane,"A guy that good-looking, still single? Bad bet. He's a player."
jane,I've had enough man trouble. I'm not getting suckered again. Amy and Charlie meet eyes. That was loaded. Jane notices.
amy,Now?
jane,I have dinner on--
charlie,I gotta go. I'll eat later.
jane,Charlie!
ed,Where the hell have you been?
charlie,"You said after school, chill out! Ed is already lugging his big duffle to Adam's front door."
ed,"Right after! It's dusk, dude, you know what that means!?"
charlie,That the sun's gone down. What's
ed,Hey! Anybody home? A long pause. Nothing.
charlie,Not here. Let's go-- But Ed's already heading around the house with the duffle.
charlie,"This is nuts. It's the SAME HOUSE we saw in the opening, but completely righted. TV is off, the walls are clean. Furniture in it's proper place. It's perfect. They move into the house. Ed is wired, scared."
ed,Hello? Ed and Charlie here!
charlie,"Okay. Fine. Ed opens his duffle bag. Inside are CROSSES, STAKES, HOLY WATER, even a small AX."
ed,"Take this. Ed hands Charlie a STAKE. Charlie eyes it, incredulous."
charlie,You've got to be kidding me. Ed stops. This is it.
ed,"I hate to tell you this but that guy, your neighbor."
charlie,My neighbor. Next door.
ed,Yeah.
charlie,I just met him. Jerry.
ed,Jerry. A beat.
charlie,"That's a terrible vampire name. ""Jerry."" Seriously--"
ed,"I didn't name him, man, I'm just reporting the facts! Ed moves UP THE STAIRS. Charlie reluctantly follows. It's darker up here. Lights off."
charlie,"Come on, this is a gag -- right? Ed's barely listening -- cautious. Every shadow is potential death. Total shmuck bait..."
ed,"Hey! Anybody here? They pass the empty MASTER BEDROOM -- where we saw ADAM's parents slaughtered. Now its clean and empty. Then Ed turns into ADAM's room. It's full of geekery. Action figures, the like. Charlie sticks behind him. The guys don't register the mostly obscured form of SOMEBODY HIDING BEHIND the door. A LARGE MALE figure. Ed catches sight of the guy, and SPINS toward it, freaked. Charlie also reacts, scared."
ed,"No, see, it's not just them. It started -- there was this thing on Channel 13, a lady escaped an attacker who tried to bite her. Ed points to the RED DOTS on his chart. They form a loose circle around CHARLIE'S house."
charlie,There's a ton of houses like that. People work nights on the strip--
ed,But every window? No. I've been watching him. It all fits--
charlie,That Jerry's a Dracula.
ed,No. Dracula is a specific vampire.
charlie,I know what you're saying! I'm mocking you. You've been reading too much Twilight--
ed,"Fiction, okay? This is real. A real monster. And he's not brooding. Or lovesick. Or noble. He's the fucking shark from JAWS. He feeds, he kills, and he doesn't move on until everyone around him is dead."
ed,"What about your neighbors, the Perrys? He moved into their house. Haven't seen them around, have you?"
charlie,"Yeah, in San Diego like a month ago!"
ed,"Exception, proves the rule. You haven't asked him in, have you? He can't get in without an invitation."
charlie,"No, but--"
ed,Your mom? Lonely divorcee...
charlie,You're on drugs.
ed,"No! Well, yeah... I thought you'd take my word, but I have evidence at home. Hard evidence. Charlie stops fighting it and humors him. Ed's lost it."
charlie,Yeah. Okay.
charlie,Right. Cause he's nocturnal.
ed,Just for -- okay -- for a minute pretend you're not a douche now--
charlie,"Look, Ed, this stuff, it was fun when we were eight--"
ed,"Right. Got it. You're soooo cool ""Brewster."" Go ahead, join the Clark High early-peakers. This is the pinnacle for them. And that includes your girl--"
charlie,Shut up.
ed,"Undeniably doable, but we used to make fun of her and her pals, remember? They're bimbos--"
charlie,"Shut up! Charlie barely refrains from hitting Ed. Instead he shoves him away. Ed stumbles. Falls. He looks up at Charlie, genuinely hurt and desperate."
ed,Adam's gone -- you act like it has nothing to do with you.
charlie,Yeah. And you know when I got popular? The minute I stopped hanging out with you. Charlie takes off. Ed watches him go.
mark,You crossed my yard. Tracked your nerdjuice all over it.
ed,Sorry. Sorry--
mark,"My mom works hard on that shit,"
ed,Can you just hit me? I don't have time for the build up.  Go.
mark,Seriously?
ed,"Jesus, man! Just do it! Fine. Mark winds up and SWINGS -- a brutal blow. Ed DUCKS and runs. Mark's immediately on his heels. The guys dodge and dart through the neighborhood. But Ed has experience in the art of losing bullies and he manages to shake Mark for a moment. Ed scrambles over a wooden fence, but his DUFFLE BAG GETS CAUGHT ON TOP. Most of his vamp hunting stuff SPILLS over on the OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE."
mark,"Unbelievable. A beat, Mark glances at the high fence. Decides he's done. He kicks some of Ed's stuff as he moves off."
ed," Hey! Let me in! Please! But there's no answer. Ed is desperate, Sees Jerry closing in, walking across the backyard. Ed takes a ROCK and smashes the window over the kitchen sink."
ed,"Forget it sucker! No invite! BAM! Jerry kicks in the kitchen door. Ed, terrified, falls back."
jerry,Abandoned. I thought you did your homework.
ed,-- what?
jerry,You've been watching me. I've been watching you. Seems fair. Ed BOLTS into the house.
jerry,"Bit off more than you can chew. Shaking, terrified, Ed brandishes the STAKE."
ed,"We'll see, man. I know my shit. But Jerry doesn't appear to be afraid. He looks at Ed with actual sympathy."
jerry,"Really? Who's going to believe you? You see the truth, but what good is it when you're alone? Ed's shaken -- but still grips the stake. Holding on."
ed,Don't play that stuff. That mind crap. Come on -- try me. Try me!
jerry,"You say you're glad you're different. But how can you be in a place like this? These people... Even your best friend. You're nothing to him now. Ed's listening despite himself, hurting now. Jerry moves a step in. Ed raises his stake again -- but with slightly less conviction."
ed,Get back!
jerry,It can be over. I can make all that pain go away. Ed's fighting tears. Life as he knows it is gone.
ed,No...
jerry,"You were born for this and you know it. Your ""life"", what you had? That's the illusion.  I can take you somewhere great. Somewhere you'll belong. Ed takes this in. His eyes clear a bit. Is it...hope?"
jane,Good on his word. A knock at the door. It's Amy. She lets herself in.
amy,Morning. Charlie?
jane,You try. My voice seems to be on some frequency he can't hear.
amy,Talk to Hot Neighbor again? You should facebook him.
jane," Temptress. I'm resolved. Charlie runs down. Wet from the shower, discombobulated. pecks Amy, grabs food off a plate. He's out of sorts."
amy,Oversleep?
charlie,Didn't.  Weird dreams. Charlie gives Jane a quick peck and follows Amy out.
amy,What? Charlie snaps out of it. It's crazy to even entertain Ed's theories.
charlie,Nothing. That guy was such a tool.
teacher,Sally Cabella?
sally,Here.
teacher,Ed Lee? Nothing. Charlie looks up.
above charlie,SEATS ALL AROUND HIM ARE EMPTY. This time it makes an impact.
mark,".she's wearing a jumpsuit, dude. Like -- one zip and POP!"
charlie,Huh.
mark,"What's up with you? Dreaming about your little boyfriend? Charlie takes this in, worried."
charlie,You see him around today? Ed?
ben,"I don't track ""it's"" whereabouts. What did he want, anyway?"
charlie,Nothing. Homework stuff. But Charlie's clearly distracted.
mark,Now? You're ditching? I'll bail with you.
charlie,"No -- I'm -- I don't feel so well. He takes off. Ben and Mark watch him, perplexed."
victoria,Charlie!
charlie,"Yeah, Hi Mrs. Lee. Victoria breaks into a wide smile."
victoria,God you're a sight for sore eyes.
victoria,Rick! Charlie's here!
charlie,"Oh, I -- you don't have to-- Now RICK, Ed's dad comes into the room. Shakes his hand."
rick,"Ed said you'd sprouted. And you're, the-- Rick awkwardly gestures around his face."
charlie,Cleared up. Yes sir--
victoria,"Ed will be so sorry he missed you, But -- you should both be in school now, shouldn't you?"
charlie,He's not here? Did you see him today?
rick,He's usually up and out early. Everything okay?
charlie,"No, sure. We're working on a class project. I guess we crossed paths."
victoria,"I'm so glad you're doing that. Ed, he'd be mad that I said so, but he talks about you all the time. This lands hard on Charlie. How remiss he's been."
charlie,Yeah. That's... He's great.
victoria,"Of course. Make yourself at home. Charlie goes upstairs. Victoria makes a face at Rick -- ""that's good!"" They're both pleased."
on charlie,"Ouch. Best not to dwell. He turns and sees-- PETER VINCENT'S ""FRIGHT NIGHT"" POSTER on a wall. Charlie takes it in, laughs a little. Then Charlie examines a WHOLE WALL devoted to Ed's investigation of Jerry. Maps, news reports, vampire lore printed off the internet, books, etc. If you didn't know the difference, you'd say it's just more of Ed's fictional world. Charlie stares at it all for a beat. Then shakes his head. It's all a fantasy -- nothing more."
charlie,"This is crazy. He starts to take off. But sees that Ed's computer is on -- and one file stands out. ""THE JERRY DIARIES."" Charlie gives in to his curiosity -- clicks it open -- finds a bunch of Quicktime files. He opens one. Stops."
off charlie,Taking this in. Chilled.
jerry,"Hey guy. Charlie tries to maintain his cool. What if Jerry is what Ed thought? Impossible, but..."
charlie,Hey. Guy.
jerry,You could really do me a solid.
charlie,Yeah? What kind.
jerry,"I have a girl on her way over for a beer, and I'm totally out of beer. They're at Charlie's back door, the one that leads to the kitchen."
charlie,Bummer.
jerry,"Set me up, I'll pay you back two times. A sixer for your mom, and one for you."
charlie,"Uh, yeah, sure."
jerry,"Nice kitchen. Same floor plan as my place, huh? Jerry leans against the door jamb -- BUT DOES NOT CROSS THE THRESHOLD. Charlie observes this. Holy shit. Charlie and Jerry MEET EYES. Then a cold smile creeps over Jerry's face. Charlie fumbles, lets one of the wet beers slide from his hand -- it hits the ground, explodes."
charlie,Fuck!
jerry,Can I help you with that?
charlie,No! No. Thanks. I'll get it. Jerry takes in Charlie's frantic refusal. Now he's darkly certain. He's been made. Charlie tosses the broken bottle into the sink. Moves to the doorway with the remaining beers. Charlie hands them over the threshold. But doesn't cross.
jerry,This girl tonight -- she's a handful. You know.
charlie,Yeah.
jerry,"You don't mind my saying, you got a lot on your shoulders for a kid. Your pal, Amy? She's ripe. Must be a line of guys dying to pluck that. Your mom too -- you don't see it, maybe you do -- she's giving it off. It's on you to watch out for them. You up for that? Charlie's burning. But holds himself in check."
charlie,I think I can manage.
jerry,"Good. Cause there are bad people out there, man. Better keep an eye on your women. Jerry backs away, intimidating even as he retreats."
amy,Where've you been? You told me to meet you here an hour ago.
charlie's pov,Jerry's nowhere to be seen and his house is quiet. Lights on behind BLACKED OUT WINDOWS.
charlie,Sorry. You okay? Everything okay? He checks his phone. Checks for anything from ED. Nothing.
amy,Yeah. Why shouldn't it be?
charlie,"No, it should. Nothing."
amy," You ever read this? It's good. Sexy, actually. Amy moves to Charlie. Puts her arms around him."
charlie,"Like us, you mean. Amy laughs, pulls him onto the bed. She's feeling frisky."
amy,Kinda makes it hotter.
charlie,"Yeah, so you keep saying. He smiles a little. She kisses him. But feels his distance."
amy,Am I boring you? What's up?
charlie,"What? No. I'm kind of wiped out, that's all."
amy,"I can fix that. She kisses him again. Despite himself, Charlie gets drawn in and turned on. She pulls back, serious."
charlie,-- now? Seriously?
amy,Calm down. Let's just... see how it goes. Charlie's dying inside. Now?! Could not be a worse time.
charlie,Believeme when I say--thereis nothing in the worldI'dratherdo
amy,"Charlie. Don't be nervous. She kisses him again. It's intense, passionate. Charlie weakens a little. Maybe death and mayhem can wait... Amy moves to take off her top. Oh. My. God-- DING DONG. Somebody is ringing the bell at Jerry's. Charlie stops. Practically tosses Amy off him."
charlie,You hear that? He rushes to the window. Looks outside.
charlie's pov,DORIS is at Jerry's front door. Holding a bottle of wine.
amy,What? JERRY comes to the door. He and Doris start chatting. She's flirting up a storm.
charlie,"Shit, shit, shit-- Amy sees what Charlie sees. Shrugs."
amy,He's hot. She's a stripper. They were bound to find each other.
amy,"Take away two tiny pieces of cloth, stripper."
charlie,"What? No-- Jerry is showing Doris in when he stops-and looks DIRECTLY AT CHARLIE. It's chilling. Charlie DIVES away from the window, grabbing Amy and pulling her down too."
amy,Maybe. Not a big deal-- Charlie's freaked now. Doris is IN THERE.
charlie,"No, it is a big. A very big. He saw us and he was pissed."
amy,Okay... Amy moves away. Looking at him skeptically.
charlie,"What? No! I am, I totally am. just -- I don't trust that guy. He glances out the window again. Amy's irritated, not used to having her passes rejected. She gathers her stuff."
amy,I'm going.
charlie,Amy. Don't--
amy,No. You've got your neighborhood watch thing.
charlie,"Come on, don't be that way-- But she's gone."
charlie,Fuck! -- DORIS is in the window now. Bruised and so pale she looks almost BLUE.
doris,Help...
charlie,"Oh my God. Oh, shit-- Charlie tugs on the door. Locked. He stands back, what to do? Charlie hears a NOISE. The FRONT DOOR. And then -- JERRY'S FOOTSTEPS approaching."
doris,Oh... Oh no... Get me out of here! Doris pounds on the door. In a cold panic.
charlie,I'm -- I won't leave you-- But Charlie has no choice. The footsteps are getting CLOSER.
doris,Please! No! Don't go!
charlie,Please... Please... The bobby pin slips. Drops. Charlie's losing it. Steadies himself. Tries again.
click,"The lock slides open. Charlie breathes with relief. Then he grabs Doris and BOLTS. Charlie SLIPS in a pool of blood left behind from Jerry's feeding, but he manages to stay on his feet. He pushes Doris ahead of him, to a BACK STAIRCASE. His PHONE drops out of his pocket, he has to double back -- every moment counts. Doris's barely aware of what's happening, let alone where she is."
charlie,Same floor plan. He grabs Doris and bolts for the kitchen.
doris,"Thank you, thank you... Doris looks up at him, her EYES TURNING BLACK, her veins going gray. A first ray of pure sunlight hits them."
charlie,"Doris? In a flash, DORIS starts to BURN. Charlie is helpless to stop it as she GOES UP IN FLAMES and explodes."
charlie reacts,Horrified. In shock.
jane,"You're going to be late. Jane moves to the windows, throws the curtains open. Charlie winces at the sun. He got no sleep, looks like hell."
charlie,"Listen -- promise me -- that guy next door, Jerry? Under no circumstances do you invite him into our house. He's dangerous."
jane,I think I can handle myself.
charlie,"No, no you can't--"
jane charlie,"Charlie-- Don't even look in his direction, understand? And at night, you stay inside."
jane,Because he's dangerous. What kind of dangerous? Charlie starts gathering his things. Getting ready to bolt.
charlie,"Can you trust me? For once, don't ask a million questions--"
jane,"Charlie. Stop. I'm your mom, not some ridiculous woman--"
jane,That's enough. I'm done with this conversation. She moves away.
charlie,"Mom! Mom-- But she's gone. Charlie looks after her, worried."
vampire faq,True VAMPIRE tales! VAMPIRE chat city How to kill a vampire
on charlie,As he scrolls and frantically scribbles notes.
on charlie,"We see now that he's on a computer in the SCHOOL LIBRARY, isolated behind some stacks. He clicks a link on one of the sites -- which leads him to PETER VINCENT'S website. It's an elaborate interactive site. It says that Vincent is a serious student of all things occult -- especially VAMPIRES -- and has amassed a vast collection of books and artifacts. It also claims that there are different TRIBES of vampires."
charlie,Hey...
amy,You weren't in class. What are you working on?
charlie,Porn. Hacked it.
amy,"Oh, good. I thought it was something creepy. Charlie nods. Smiles wanly. Then--"
charlie,"Look, I'd better..."
amy,"Get back to your porn. Got it. She looks away, losing patience. Charlie rallies."
charlie,No. Sorry. I'm just -- I could use some coffee. She looks back. Okay.
charlie,"We can't hang out at my house any more. My mom's flipping out about some stuff. I can see you at school, but for a while --"
amy,Why? What's going on?
charlie,"It's hard to explain. Just... What can he say? He has to protect her, but how? BEN AND MARK Join them. Notice how tweaked Charlie looks."
ben,You look like dog shit.
charlie,Thanks.
mark,"Your pal the spaz, his folks were here earlier. It's a big thing."
charlie,What? Why?
mark,"I don't know. He ran away or something. They were all upset, talking to the principal."
ben,"One less tweaker clogging up the halls. Charlie stands, upset."
charlie,Shut up.
mark ben,Charlie-- Chill out-
mark,You're right. Not cool. You're worried and it's totally understandable.
amy,Charlie!! What the hell is wrong with you?!
amy,"Just get out of here, Charlie. Go. He knows it's over. Heartbroken, he takes off."

peter,"And if I miss, she'll really be dead. The music switches. It's all TENSION. Peter FLINGS a dagger. SCHWACK! The assistant DUCKS as the KNIFE embeds in the board behind her, this close where her head was. She screams! Breaks character."
sexy assistant,Holy Shit! Pete! Also out of character -- PETER speaks in a thick QUEEN'S
peter,You can't say that!  Stop the-- STOP. CUT!! The music stops. The spinning board stops.
sexy assistant,You almost tore my extensions out! Why do you have to throw a real knife!?
sexy assistant,Everybody else fakes it!
peter,But this looks authentic--
sexy assistant,Then learn how to throw! She stomps off the stage. Peter can't believe it.
peter,Screw this. He starts to stalk off stage. CHARLIE rushes toward him.
charlie,Mr. Vincent! Mr. Vincent-- A tech guy moves in on Charlie.
peter,I don't think so. Talk to my guy.
charlie,"We're doing a piece -- ""Vampires. Separating myth from fact."""
peter,"You want a comment? That's a shit idea for an article. Peter starts to move off. Charlie, anxious, follows."
charlie,"Please. I really -- I need your expertise. You're the man on this stuff, right? Peter sees how desperate Charlie is. Stops."
peter,"What is this, like your first assignment?"
charlie,Actually -- yeah.
peter, Ten minutes.
arthur,"Don't touch anything, dude."
charlie,Ho -- wow.
arthur,"Got rooms of this crap. Ebay. Charlie examines a case that holds all kinds of TORTURE DEVICES and battle axes, as well as SPIKED BALL MACES, etc. Cases hold ancient texts and scrolls, haunted objects, etc."
charlie,"Amazing. Charlie is genuinely impressed. The geek in him can't help it. Peter enters, talks to Arthur--"
peter,"Midori me. Arthur pours Peter a green drink as Peter pulls off his black wig  and peels off a nude body shirt that has a bunch of TATTOOS printed on it. He steps out of his boots, with three-inch LIFTS. Collapses into an arm chair. He's just another balding, middle-aged guy with bad eyes. Peter downs his drink. Arthur hands him the bottle. Peter looks at Charlie. In truth, Peter's isolated himself to the point that he actually welcomes a visitor -- though he'd never admit it."
charlie,"No, thanks. Not...on the job. Peter scratches avidly at his crotch."
peter,"Leather, it doesn't breath. You know? Fucking rashes are killing me... So I'm your expert, huh? For your vampire thing."
charlie,Yeah. I guess... So -- say I want to kill one. But really. How how would you do it?
peter,"Depends. You got fire, beheading. Or go classic -- stake through the heart. Bam!"
charlie,So all that actually works?
peter,How the fuck do I know.
charlie,I thought you're--
peter,"I read books, man. You think I'm hanging out with Dracula and the Easter Bunny?"
charlie,Sorry. No. Charlie realizes he has no choice. He has to reveal more.
peter,"Them, meaning a ""vampire."""
charlie,Jerry. He lives next door to me.
peter,"""Jerry?"""
charlie,I know.
peter,Arthur!
charlie,"No, come on, I'm--"
peter,You're a nutjob. Arthur! Charlie deflates -- his desperation showing again.
charlie,Listen to me. I saw it. I saw him kill a girl. She burned up in my hands. You have to tell me how to stop him. Arthur enters.
peter,Get this loser out of my sight.
charlie,I know what I saw.
peter,No you don't. See this guy? He gestures to ARTHUR.
peter,In Clark County Nevada. A hot bed of supernatural activity.
charlie,"Yes! It's genius. A transient population. A town where people work all night, sleep all day..."
peter,"A town full of con-artists.  No. You're working me, or somebody's working you. Charlie's getting angry now."
charlie,He already got my friend! I know how I sound. But I'm not crazy. I didn't want this. I don't want to know this. Just tell me what to do! Peter feels Charlie's sincerity. For a moment he looks genuinely conflicted. But his expression hardens.
peter,Run.
charlie,What?
peter,"You heard me. He moves away. But Charlie is on his heels. Peter looks to ARTHUR, nods."
charlie,"So I save my own skin so he can keep killing!? I won't. We have to kill him! Please!-- Arthur THROWS Charlie out, the door closed firmly behind him."
charlie,What? Jane walks in. Takes in the decor.
jane,The whole house looks like that show Dark Shadows.
charlie,It's a gag. For Amy. Long story.
jane," You like her a lot, don't you? A moment when they could connect. But Charlie just nods. Jane's disappointed. Then--"
charlie,"Okay. He goes back to his work. Jane looks at him for a beat, then she starts to go."
charlie,How'd you get in?!
amy,It was unlocked.
charlie,MOM! You have to lock the door!
amy,"Okay, whatever, listen. You're flipping out. Punching out your friends and blowing everything off and is that a stake? A beat. He forgot he was holding it. He hides it behind his back."
charlie,"No. Amy sits, upset. Looks around and sees that the living room is decked in more anti-vamp decor."
amy,Look. Even if you're losing it -- you don't get to blow me off. You don't go from something to nothing overnight.
charlie,I can't let you get hurt. You need to forget about me for a while.
amy,What? How am I going to get hurt? Tell me. Charlie-- Now there's another KNOCK at the door. Jane comes downstairs-
jane,I got it--
charlie,NO. Don't answer it. A tense moment. Another knock.
jane,This is ridiculous--
jerry,Jane. It's Jerry from next door--
charlie,"I'm telling you, don't answer it!"
jane,"This is my house. I'll answer the door if I want to. She starts to move to the door again. Charlie blocks her way, desperate."
charlie,"Mom. He murdered Ed and Adam. And I have proof. Jane is stunned, at a loss. From the other side of the door--"
jane,Just-- Hold on!
jane,Charlie. What's happening?
charlie,"Whatever he says, don't--"
charlie,Mom. A tense beat... Finally--
on jerry,As he backs away from the door. His expression goes cold. He disappears into the dark.
charlie,"Shit, shit..."
jane,What? What is he doing?
charlie,"Whatever it is, it's not good."
charlie,Just -- if we stay in here -- he has to give up. He can't get in without an invitation.
charlie,Vampire. Really. Amy and Jane are blown away. Charlie's going crazy.
jane,Think about what you're saying--
charlie,"I have. I've ""processed,"" believe me. Jane takes this in. Then SMILES."
jane,Ooooh. This is the gag! For Amy. I can't believe you got Jerry to go along with it! Charlie stops. Fuck.
charlie,Take these. Put them on. Just do it.
amy,I don't think this is funny. But she puts it on.
jerry,Don't need an invitation if there's no house. A beat. Charlie GRABS Amy and Jane and they RUN through the house.
amy,I can drive--
jane,I drive! They jump into Jane's car. Hit the garage opener--
charlie,"Gun it Mom! Go!!! Jane GUNS IT THROUGH THE OPENING GARAGE DOOR, destroying it. She CLIPS Charlie's dirt bike -- pushing it onto the sidewalk as she takes off. Jane's car swings wide into the street, almost smashing into an arriving FIRE ENGINE! Charlie, Amy and Jane SCREAM!! They narrowly avoid a head-on collision with a FIRE TRUCK."
on jerry,As he sees the dirt bike in the driveway. He jumps on. Tries to start it. NO GO. Fuck.
jane,"What did we do!? What does he want!? They are racing away when the DIRT BIKE COMES CRASHING THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW of the car, nearly taking Amy's head off."
charlie,"Amy! Amy's hair gets caught in the spokes - it's horrible as it YANKS part of her hair out. Charlie grabs her away from the bike -- she falls into his arms, crying as JERRY's BIG PICKUP appears in the rear windshield."
jane,He's coming!
amy,My brother has a gun!
charlie,Good to know! Is he here?!
jane,Call the police! Anybody-- Jane manages to evade Jerry until -- The TRUCK SKIDS in a long arc in front of them and BLOCKS THEM. Jane screeches to a halt.
charlie,"GO! Go! Don't stop!! Go-- Charlie steps on the accelerator, grabs the wheel and AIMS"
jane,"Charlie!! They RUN JERRY OVER WITH A TERRIBLE THUDDDD!!! Amy and Jane scream. Jane is aghast, stops the car."
amy,Are you nuts!? You can't kill that guy!
charlie,You have no idea.
amy,Oh... Are you-- Jane? Jane is woozy. Hurt.
charlie,Mom?
jane,"I'm okay... Charlie sees that the other car is drivable. The guy inside, a FAMILY MAN, is stunned and pissed. Gets out of his car--"
family man,"What the hell do you think you're doing!-- Charlie gets out of the car too. Yells, urgent--"
charlie,"NO! Hey man, stay in your-- But it's too late. The guy is met by a HORRIFIC Jerry, hideously torn and bleeding, who appears from UNDER JANE'S"
charlie,"Go! I'll catch up! She's hurt, get out of here! They back off. Charlie pulls a large cross out of his coat and brandishes it as he walks toward Jerry. Jerry keeps his distance, taunting"
jerry,"Let them run. Just makes them easier to kill when I'm done with you. Ding, ding, ding -- the family man's CAR DOOR is open and the warning bell rings over and over... CHARLIE eyes the car. Keys still in it. He circles Jerry, backing him off."
charlie,I repel you with the power of Christ the Lord.
jerry,Do you? Really? When did you take your last confession?
charlie,Get back...
jerry,"That's a mighty big cross you have there. Question is -- do you actually know how to use it? Jerry LUNGES for Charlie, but he DIVES for the family man's open car door. But Jerry's on him -- hands BURNING as he rips the cross from Charlie and shatters it with his hand. Then he TOSSES Charlie, who flies and hits JANE'S CAR, then crumples to the ground. Jerry gets Charlie around the neck -- holds a sharp, splintered end of the broken cross against Charlie's chest. The wood still burns into Jerry's hand, but Jerry holds on."
jane,"Leave my kid alone. Jane collapses, and we see that there's a lot of BLOOD on the back of her head."
charlie,"Mom! Jerry's in agony as he stumbles away, pulls the sign post out of his shoulder. Charlie grabs his mom and drags her into her wreck of a car. Amy dives into the car with them. Charlie presses the accelerator. Will it still drive?"
charlie,"My mom didn't feel right, we were trying to get her to the hospital. It was stupid to let her drive."
charlie,It wasn't there when you got there?
amy,We won't stay up all night. Bee and Cara need help with Trig -- it's not a party. Okay. Okay...
jane,"Who lies motionless in a bed. A doctor checks her chart. AMY hangs up. Charlie, finished with the cops, joins her. They're both pained as they look at Jane."
charlie,"Like what? A vampire moved next door, borrowed some beer, ate a stripper and then blew up our house because we wouldn't invite him in? Amy looks at him."
amy,Okay. The DOCTOR approaches.
doctor,You should get some rest.
charlie,"She's going to wake up, right?"
doctor,"Assuming the swelling is minimal, I hope so."
charlie,But you don't know.
doctor,"Not yet. We need to give it time. The doctor puts a hand on Charlie's shoulder, leaves. Charlie turns away, upset. Amy watches, feeling helpless."
assistant,Bye babe. Good show tonight. He's barely paying attention.
peter,"You were late again on ""The Devil's Torture Chamber."" But she's gone. A beat. He moves back toward the library shelves. As he does he notices the PHOTOS Charlie took at Jerry's place."
charlie,This is my fault.
amy,You didn't make any of it happen.
charlie,Ed came to me. I turned my back on him.
amy,How were you supposed to believe him? None of it makes sense.
charlie,"He did talk a lot of demented crap.  He was my best friend. He asked me, begged me, to believe him."
amy,People change. Everybody--
charlie,"Yeah they do. I turned into a dick. I figured my dweeb past, not big with the ladies."
charlie,I wanted you to like me. I tried to erase Ed -- all of it. I know how that feels.
amy,"I knew you were a dweeb.  You think I want a ""dude"" like Mark or Ben? I like that you're different... It didn't hurt that your skin cleared up. She smiles, takes his hand. A sweet, connected moment. Then something alarming occurs to Amy:"
amy,"No, seriously. I'm going to die a virgin? Me? How did this happen?"
charlie,We're not going to die--
amy,But what if we do? Let's do it. Now. The bathroom. Charlie. A beat.
charlie,I think we should kill the vampire first. I'll perform much better. They laugh -- trying not to cry. Then:
amy,"Oh my God, Charlie. What are we going to do?"
charlie,We're going to fight. Then Charlie's phone rings. He answers.
peter,I can help you. My place. One hour.
amy,The Peter Vincent?
charlie,"Under-whelming, believe me. But he's what we've got. They close Jane's door and we see that it's COVERED in CROSSES of every shape and size. It's quite a spectacle. A nurse passes, looks at Charlie and Amy quizzically."
close on,A MIDORI cocktail WIDEN to reveal that PETER is pouring himself a whopper. Amy and Charlie sit nearby.
peter,"I'll tell you what I know, but that's it. Don't expect me to join your Scooby gang."
charlie,Anything. I'll take it.
peter,"I found the origin of that insignia you showed me. It's a species that originated in the Mediterranean. They nest in the earth -- explains that hole you saw. And they kill slowly, keep their victims alive for days."
charlie,So -- they turn all of them?  Make their victims into vampires.
amy,I know. I read.
peter,No. It takes a while before they complete the change. They usually finish them off before that.
amy,"So how do you kill these guys, this ""tribe""?"
peter,"Usual stuff. But it's a strong breed. You need a plan-- A VOICE interrupts over an intercom. It's ARTHUR, Peter's assistant."
peter,Send him in.
peter,I don't know. Maybe-- Charlie stands.
charlie,No. You said he could come in. The delivery guy. That's--
amy,What? Charlie--
ed,"Looking at them now. Yes sir.  He's modern, Jerry, dispensed with all that ""master"" stuff."
charlie,"You've got a problem, keep it with me."
ed,"Problem? You let him get me, man."
ed,"You let him turn me into this. At that, ED VAMPS. Black eyes, black veins. Those teeth. It's terrifying. SMASH!! One of the cabinets shatters. Ed, Charlie and Amy spin to see PETER standing by the open collection case. A SMALL NAIL in his hand. He's shaking like a leaf."
peter,"Stay away, demon."
ed," ""Stay awaaaay, demon!"" Ed closes in on Peter. Peter looks to Charlie. It's real."
peter,Crucifixion nail. Lethal to you.
ed,"Old school. Nice. Got to get pretty close to use it, though. Peter looks at the short piece of metal in his hand. Fuck. HE BOLTS down the nearest hallway."
charlie,The elevator!
ed,"A panic room!? You better panic, loser! You better watch your neck!"
amy,"Oh my God, oh my God... Amy's starting to lose it. Charlie grabs her."
charlie,Look at me. Stop.
ed,"Give it up, Chuck! You're dead."
on ed,As he comes around the same corner a moment later. AMY and CHARLIE are NOWHERE to be seen.
guard,"Sign in, please."
jerry,I know where I'm going.
guard,"Sign in. No exceptions. Jerry ignores him, keeps moving toward the elevator."
ed,"I expected more of a fight. Girl's made you lazy in the head. Pussy'll do that. ED YANKS the curtain on the confessional open. ARTHUR hides there, terrified."
close on,A large cabinet on the other side of the room. AMY AND CHARLIE are squeezed behind it. They react to HORRIBLE SCREAMS as Ed rips ARTHUR apart.
on ed,"His face bloodied. Eyes wild. The trembling body of ARTHUR on the ground at his feet. Ed turns Arthur over. Arthur's still breathing, reaches for something around his neck. A cross? No, it's a chain with PICTURES of sweet-faced children on silver charms."
arthur,.I have ...kids ...
ed,Had. Ed lifts Arthur off his feet and chokes him with one hand...
ed,"I know you're here. I can hear you breathing. It's totally cool. He laughs, hyper. Excited."
ed,"Mano e...one mano. Piece of cake. Cause I'm a God Damned killing machine, and you're like all the Clark High big shots -- nothing."
charlie,I didn't pick--
ed,You didn't think. Charlie's wrecked about what he has to do.
charlie,"I know. I'm sorry. Charlie takes a swing with the AXE. Ed starts BOUNDING around the room, avoiding Charlie's swings as he clings to walls and, impossibly, THE CEILING."
ed,"Steeeerike! Call that a swing, Slugger? Charlie swings and swings, but Ed is too fast for him. Finally, Charlie connects with ED'S NECK. Blood flies, Charlie can't look -- anguished."
amy,"Charlie! She smashes into one GLASS CABINET after another, pulling out and pocketing everything she can find to fight ED. Finds a GUN loaded with silver bullets..."
jerry,"You are something, aren't you? Amy spins. Jerry's closing in on her. Beautiful, seductive. She's shaking, terrorized. BAM, BAM, BAM!! She empties the GUN into JERRY anyway. It knocks him back, but he's still standing. He picks a silver bullet out of his shoulder, unimpressed."
amy,Vampires. She RUNS.
ed,"Bone is a motherfucker, Chuckles. Hard to cut. Charlie takes another swing with his axe. Ed jumps out of the way."
amy,"Do it. Charlie! Charlie's frozen. Ed starts to get up, his head a mess. It's now or never."
ed,Wow. Bimbo has some juice--
amy,Jerry's here. He's coming!
charlie," I'm sorry. WHAP, Charlie stakes ED in the heart. Ed looks at Charlie with surprise... Ed's hideous features seem to dissolve. For a brief moment -- he looks like himself again."
ed,"I wasn't even a badass vamp. I was his Renfield. Funny if you-- Ed starts to VIBRATE HORRIBLY, his WHOLE BODY moving so impossibly fast he's little more than a BLUR... Then he BURNS UP FROM THE INSIDE OUT. Charlie's paralyzed -- in a world of hurt. Amy grabs him. Pulls him out of the room."
amy,I found the stairs. Come on.
amy,"Stop. Stop, I need to--"
charlie,Not now. He's coming for us.
amy,"He can't kill us, not here--"
charlie,"Who's going to notice? Who's going to care? Amy, look around--"
amy,"Oh, God..."
charlie,"Keep moving. Come on. Now Charlie sees JERRY some distance behind them now, moving toward them in the crowd. They meet eyes. Charlie grabs Amy, scans for someplace to hide. He spots a nightclub -- ""REFLECTIONS"". The outside walls are all mirrored, like a brightly lit diamond."
on jerry,"Behind them in the crowd, he sees them slip into the club."
dj,"Tequila Man t-shirts! Yeeeeeahhhh! The crowd goes nuts, SURGES forward... Someone bumps Amy and Charlie and they lose hands."
amy,"Charlie! Charlie turns, a DRUNK CHICK gets in his way -- tries to dance with him. He pushes past her."
charlie,"Amy? Amy! Charlie can't see Amy, instead sees HIMSELF over and over again in a series of mirrors -- the infinity effect. It's dizzying, disorienting. THEN HE SEES JERRY, a shark, moving in and out of the crowd, disappearing behind mirrored columns, reemerging... Charlie also sees that JERRY DOESN'T REFLECT in the mirrors around them. Instead the crowd parts as if by magic. Jerry's heading straight toward--"
amy,"who's been pushed toward the DJ stand by the crowd. She's spinning, looking desperately for Charlie."
jerry,Holding her with a firm grip.
amy,"No. No! Amy STRUGGLES and CRIES OUT as JERRY PULLS HER away from CHARLIE, toward ramp that leads to another dance floor. Jerry laughs, throws her over his shoulder."
guy,"Go get her, man! AMY sees her fast-moving reflection in the mirror -- she appears to be FLOATING above the people."
amy,"Help me! Help!! CHARLIE can SEE HER, but can't get to her. The crowd is indifferent to her cries. Charlie grabs his cell -- hits a button. It dials, then--"
amy,"Charlie's coming, he'll find me--"
jerry,I'm counting on it. Amy SPITS on him. Jerry reacts -- a flash of RAGE and he exposes his brutal rows of TEETH for just an instant.
charlie,Amy! No!-- BAM! A hand falls on his shoulder.
doorman,How'd you get in here?
charlie,"You have to help me. That guy, he's going to kill her, he's a"
doorman,"Yeah? Then she's liking it. Charlie's beside himself, enraged and terrorized."
charlie,You don't understand!--
doorman,ID. Then you can tell me your whole sad story--
charlie,"No! There's no time-- Amy!! Charlie's increasingly desperate, tries to RUN. But the doorman has a good grip, pulls him back."
jerry,"Sees that CHARLIE is restrained. Jerry locks eyes with Charlie and SMILES, his horrible fangs exposed. He's taking Charlie's woman -- and enjoying it."
charlie's pov,"As he's being dragged away -- JERRY BRUTALLY BITES AMY. It's a nightmare. Charlie loses it, screaming and flailing. But there is no helping her."
peter,How'd you get in here?
charlie,"Security's a little lax. Everybody got their throat ripped out. Peter backs away as Charlie moves in. Charlie is different. Colder, harder. Like he's aged a decade in one night."
peter,You too? He change you?
charlie,Look at your monitor. PETER turns to a security monitor in his closet. Charlie
peter,"Don't you get what this is? There's no fighting. There's only surviving, if you're lucky--"
charlie,"You call this surviving? If you live and we all die, you think you'll ever be able to get us out of your head?"
peter,I know I won't. I never could -- not after the first time. This stops Charlie.
charlie,Made what up?
peter,"The vampire who killed my parents, my brothers. But not me. I hid. Charlie reacts. Surprised, but now it all makes sense. Peter continues, haunted--"
charlie,So do it. We'll go in at dawn. He's got to rest sometime--
charlie,"So you bail on people, erase them."
peter,Wait. Peter takes something from his luggage. A stake carved from WHITE WOOD. He hands it to Charlie.
peter,Who knows what's for real any more. Charlie takes the stake. Starts to go. Peter stops him--
charlie,I'll figure it out.
peter,"No, you need a plan. To stake him, you have to get close -- he's stronger than you."
charlie,Holy water?
peter,Slow him down. Won't stop him.
charlie,"But if he's on fire, how do I get close enough to stake him? A beat."
peter,Fuck.
store guy,Good for you. The store guy waits. Charlie hands over his money.
charlie,"Let's do this shit. He swallows hard, scared but determined."
no amy,"Finally, Charlie hears a GROAN. He opens a window in the door for yet another room. AMY'S lying on the floor, turned away from him. Charlie's not sure what he'll see when he gets a better look at her."
charlie,Where is he?
amy,I don't know. He dumped me here. I'm bait. He said so--
charlie,How do you feel?
amy,I'll survive. Please get out of here. He's too strong--
charlie,I'm stronger.
charlie,Shit! You--
peter charlie,Sorry-- How'd you-- A beat. Then:
peter,Guess I don't want to be a man like me either. Peter opens his leather coat -- it's loaded with weapons. And a flask. Peter grins.
peter,Don't get greedy. I'm here.
charlie,Wooden bullets? Nice.
peter,"No, you think I'm fucking MacGyver? Bullet, bullets. They'll buy us some time. Charlie is grateful, but now's not the time for man hugs."
charlie,"We have to find Amy. She was in a room upstairs, then she just disappeared. This house--"
peter,"What do you mean she ""disappeared?"""
charlie,"She was there. I looked away, looked back -- she was gone. Peter takes this in."
peter,Show me where.
charlie,Where does it go?
peter,Only one way to find out.
charlie,Wait -- you're going in?
peter,"See that? Like a great date. Get me drunk and I'll try anything. Peter lets go and FALLS. Charlie steels himself, goes in after him."
peter,"Ow, crap... They look around -- eyes adjusting. There's barely any light. They're in a LARGE UNFINISHED BASEMENT. The floor is dirt and the main story of the house is held up by numerous"
on charlie,As he sees something. Stops. A MOUND of dirt. Like a grave. Charlie indicates to Peter to follow him. They whisper:
charlie,"You uncover him. I'll light him up, then stake him. Charlie pulls a FABRIC MASK, like a ski mask, over his face. Peter looks at him."
peter,"You should be a magician. As the face emerges, Charlie readies a match, then reaches for his STAKE--"
charlie,Adam. I know him. Knew him.
peter,"Shh. Don't wake him up, for"
charlie,Ms. Granada. My geometry teacher.
peter,"How about we go back to my ""run away"" plan?"
peter,I thought you're here for Amy.  Great. Right. Save the Geometry-- A SCREAM stops him. Amy. Charlie and Peter spin -- it's coming from behind the door to the other room. A beat. They're both petrified as they move toward the door. Peter readies the gun again. Charlie pulls a CROSS out along with the stake. They creep toward the door.
jerry,"You look bigger on TV. Peter fires the shotgun, BLAM! But he misses Jerry and the power of the blast sends PETER"
charlie,"Amy, God... She clings to him, near tears."
amy,Charlie.
jerry,"In pain, he TRANSFORMS and VAMPS before our eyes with a blood- curdling yell. It's chilling."
amy,"You should have run with me while we had the chance. You should have saved me, Charlie."
charlie,It's not too late. She brings her lips close to his ear. Rasps...
amy,It is. He's inside me now. Her EYES GO DARK -- fingernails grow SHARP and dig into Charlie. He feels the change.
jerry,"It's over, guy. Charlie -- his girl's having her way with him."
peter,"Stop! Stop! Desperate, he BLASTS them again. Hits one on the shoulder. But it's not stopping them."
jerry,And your aim--
peter,You don't get it! I'm on your side. Peter smiles a little. Shows his rows of SHARP FANGS. Jerry and the others stop. What?
amy,You wouldn't.
charlie,"Try me. She STRADDLES HIM, sexual and raw. Charlie's repulsed, terrified."
amy,I'll be the best you ever had. The only you had.
charlie,I know. He backs away from her. Into--
charlie,Get off him! He hits MS. GRANADA off Peter. Manages to hold off JERRY for a beat. Spins and HITS ADAM in the head.
adam,Dude!
charlie,Sorry. AMY enters from the other room -- already healing. Jerry sees her -- holds up a hand and backs the others off.
jerry,"I'll finish this. Jerry, all swagger, moves in on Charlie. Charlie sees Peter, barely alive, spit out his FAKE VAMP teeth. Peter meets his gaze, wry and weak. Done for."
peter,"Worth a shot. ""Master of illusion."" Now Charlie notices SHOTGUN not far from Peter's body. He dives for it, but Jerry steps on it -- kicks it away."
peter,Fuck.
charlie,"Yeah you are. Peter looks at him, sad."
peter,Get out of here. We don't have much time before they dig out.
peter,"You're a brave mother, I get it. And you were right. This is how I had to go... But we didn't count on an army."
charlie,"He'll kill you both, he said--"
peter,We're already dead.
jerry,"Still burning, looks down as the STAKE OF SAINT MICHAEL in his CHEST. Right through the heart. He starts to SHAKE VIOLENTLY -- faster and faster, just like Ed did -- becoming little more than a macabre BLUR. For a moment -- Jerry's human form hangs in the air..."
jerry,Blow me.
on amy,Transformed and healed. Herself again. She rushes to the edge of the open grave.
amy,Charlie! She crawls into the grave. Cradles Charlie in her arms.
charlie,Blow me? Seriously? Peter falls back -- exhausted. Laughing.
jane,Think you'll ever feel the same about a nighttime sky?
peter,Same as what? I was always terrified.
jane,Right. We're just catching up.
charlie,I'm not seeing that.
amy,She deserves some fun. Your mom fully cheated death.
amy,"Oh, I plan on it. Now that you've killed your first vampire..."
charlie,"I am so going to perform. Charlie KISSES her. It's intense, passionate. It's different, they're different. The childish part of them long gone. He runs his hands through her hair, pulls her close. SOMETHING BEEPS, talks..."
voice,"""Frak!"" ""Frak!"""
charlie,Battlestar.
amy,Right.
charlie,"It was Ed's. Amy smiles a little, softens."
amy,Right.
peter,Frak! Right on.
amy,I'll take another. Thanks.
peter,"It's dark.  I'm on the ""day"" wagon."
charlie,Thanks for inviting us.
peter,We should celebrate. Being alive. Your mom's clean bill of health.
charlie,You wanted to put the moves on her.
peter,What? No. What?
charlie,Just -- I'm watching you. I've got to look out for her.
peter,Yeah you do. So here's what I'm thinking. We faced the beast and we won. Can you imagine the possibilities if we had got that shit on film?
peter,"Show up on film, yeah. But werewolves do, bigfoots do. We get proof, catch something -- we could build a stage act around that, you wouldn't believe. We'd blow those Cirque bitches away!"
charlie,An act? Seriously? What about saving people from evil? What
peter,It happens. All this stuff...
charlie,"Ever think about collecting something else? Snow globes or-- Charlie stops, catches sight of something MOVING IN THE"
