Speaker,Dialogue
arblus,"Transform and flee, Kranix! You must warn all you meet of the horror of Unicron! Suddenly, the pitiful creature is surrounded by the strange energy cloud and it looks like his body has simultaneously caught fire and been doused with acid."
kranix,Arblus!   No!
2.,CONTINUED:
narrator,It is the year 2005. The treacherous Decepticons have conquered the Autobots' home planet of Cybertron. But from secret staging grounds on two of Cybertron's moons the valiant Autobots prepare to retake their homeland.
ironhide,"Every time I look into this thing, my circuits sizzle. I'm tired of this waiting game, Prime. When are we gonna start bustin' Deceptichops?"
optimus prime,"We still don't have enough Energon cubes to power a full scale assault, Ironhide."
ironhide,Then let me make another run to Autobot City on Earth. I'll bring you back more cubes than you'll know what to do with.
prime,"Alright, ready the shuttle for launch."
ironhide,YAHOO!  Your days are numbered now Decepticreeps.
jazz,"No sign of Decepticons in this sector, Prime."
prime,What about Moon Base 2?
another moon,This is the second moon. It is much closer to Cybertron than the first one. This is where Bumblebee and Spike are stationed.
4.,CONTINUED:
bumblebee,Bumblebee and Spike here.
bumblebee,"All clear, Jazz. "
spike,"Hey,   Ironhide, tell my son, Daniel, I miss   him, and tell him I'll be coming home   as soon as we've kicked Megatron's tail   across the galaxy."
ironhide,"Will do, Spike."
prime,"Commence countdown, Cliffjumper."
cliffjumper,Five...Four...Three...Two...
cliffjumper,One....
5.,CONTINUED:
prime,"Now, all we need is a little Energon and a lot of luck."
ironhide,"If I can dodge Dececpticon rays, I can sure as shootin' dodge a couple of asteroids."
prowl,You were saying?
megatron,Die Autobots!
brawn,is cut in half by Megatron's blast.
on prowl,as SCAVENGER MELTS HIM DOWN.
the insecticons,"...eat away at the hole in the shuttle to make way for... ...an ARMY of other Decepticons including Laserbeak who enter, firing."
megatron,"This was almost too easy, Starscream."
starscream,"Much easier, oh mighty Megatron, than attacking the real threat: the Autobots moon base."
megatron,"You're an idiot, Starscream. Were we simply to wipe out that minuscule base, they could build another one. "
7.,"CONTINUED: MEGATRON  But when we slip by their security systems in their own ship and destroy Autobot city, the Autobots will be vanquished forever!"
ironhide,"Fat chance, Megatron!"
megatron,Such heroic nonsense!
on daniel,"Daniel, a classic twelve year old American boy watches the portable viewer which is like an over-sized Boy Scout compass. WIDEN SHOT to show he is at an old fashioned ""fishin' hole"" on Earth - surrounded by weeping willows, assorted trees and shrubs, and that his fishing pole is stuck in the dirt, the line floating lazily out on the water."
daniel,"Let's watch Ironhide land it, Hot Rod! As Daniel runs to small skateboard-like device, hits a button, and watches, it transforms into a hoverboard and rides it, like a surfer up a steep, grassy hillside we change angle to feature..."
hot rod,"an ""adolescent"" Autobot. He is in robot mode, sitting with his fishing rod held between two fingers, looking bored with it all."
daniel, Hurry or we'll miss it!
hot rod,lopes up hill after Daniel.
daniel,Hey!   Let me out.
hot rod,Why settle for a peek when you can see everything from Lookout Mountain?
daniel,But we're not supposed to go beyond City limits!
hot rod,Chromo-Chicken!
kup,disgustedly watches Hot Rod drive up the mountain.
hot rod,This is it! Now take a squint through those babies.
daniel,"Hot Rod, look! There's a hole in the shuttle!"
hot rod,What!?
hot rod,This is for Ironhide.    As so's this!
starscream,He ducks away from the door.
the constructicons,Firing out of the hole.
megatron,He's furious.
starscream,It was your stupid strategy!
kup,What's that darn fool doing? Hound looks up and points.
11.,CONTINUED:
hound,Decepticons!
hot rod,Hang on!
hot rod, WHoooooooaaah
blitzwing," Come on down, Autobrat!"
hot rod,Yiiiiiiiiii!
12.,CONTINUED:
on blitzwing,"about to fire, when..."
shrapnel,who is flying nearby.
blitzwing,"transforms to robot mode and turns as... Kup comes flying, feet first, into Blitzwing knocking him off the mountain ledge."
hot rod,Not bad for an old timer!
kup," Old timer?! That's something you'll never be if you don't get back to the city. You know what we used to do with cocky, insubordinate upstarts?"
hot rod, Save it.
starscream,"transforming into jet mode, fires on them with laser bursts which..."
13.,CONTINUED:
perceptor,"transforms to humanoid and runs toward...... ... Three new Autobots, ARCEE, a lovely female Autobot of about Hot Rod's age, SPRINGER, a very muscular and bantering ""Indiana Jones"" type Autobot and ULTRA MAGNUS, the large and soldierly City Commander."
perceptor,Ultra Magnus.....a cursory evaluation of Decepticon capability indicates a distinct tactical deficit!
ultra magnus,"In other words, Perceptor..."
springer, We're outnumbered!
ultra magnus,"Springer, Arcee, transform Autobot City!"
starscream,"TRANSFORMS and hovers in robot mode, firing all around them as they..."
starscream,"There's no escape...Uuuuh! Just then, the floor of the courtyard STARTS TRANSFORMING - - the center line of the floor snaps shut like the halves of a gigantic steel shelled clam, trapping Starscream's foot."
starscream,Agggggggh!     My foot!
on megatron,"as he FLIES OVER SCENE, BLASTING this way and that, shouting"
megatron,Breach their defenses!
on insecticons,"who are trailing Megatron, attack the fast CLOSING CITY, trying to GNAW AND DEVOUR their way through the PORTS and BRIDGES leading inside."
kickback," Delicious, eh Shrapnel?"
shrapnel, A little heavy on the electrons. Electrons.
another angle,"Hot Rod speeds up, passes Kup and... ... rides up and over Kickback's back, using it like a stunt driver's ramp to..."
on shrapnel,"As Shrapnel looks up and reacts... ...Kup hurtles up and over Kickback's back just as Kickback is starting to rise to see what knocked him face down onto the bridge in the first place. ... Kup goes SAILING OT OVER OPEN SPACE between Kickback's back and the doorway into the city- -clobbering Shrapnel, who is in the way and landing on the city doorstep, driving in as..."
the doorway,"transforms, shutting down with metal shields with a ""clank"" sound as Kickback and Shrapnel both leap at is to... ... bite Kup and Hot Rod and instead BREAK THEIR TEETH on steel door, falling face down with a grunt as LAST BITS OF CITY"
ultra magnus," You can explain your security violation later, Hot Rod! Now, man your battle station."
hot rod,I don't have to explain my so called violation to you or anyone...
kup," He said ""later!"""
blaster,Lookout and shout! Yow! Explosions rock the Crows Nest. Blaster swivels around and tilts to see...
blaster,activates turret type LASER CANNON
blaster,Gonna lay some slugs on those overweight bugs! 
cannon swivels,LASER BLAST cooks out and we FOLLOW IT OFF SCREEN to...
the insecticons,as a Laser BLAST hurls Bombshell up and out of sight and causes Shrapnel and Kickback to get sucked into the vacuum.
blaster,Perceptor joins him.
blaster," Hey, Perceptor, what's shakin' other than this fortress?"
perceptor,"Blaster, Ultra Magnus sends orders to contact Optimus Prime for reinforcements."
blaster,"Alright! Cover your receptors, Perceptor! Blaster transforms to ghetto blaster mode and broadcasts VISIBLE waves..."
the waves,rise and expand into space
blaster,Optimus Prime... Do you read me? The Decepticons are blitzing Autobot City. We're really takin' a pounding. Don't know how much longer we can hold out.
megatron,Soundwave!     Jam that transmission.
on soundwave,SOUNDWAVE moves forward and starts heaving CASSETTES upwards toward Blaster's Crows Nest position.
soundwave,Rumble! Frenzy! Ravage! Ratbat! Eject! Operation: interference.
on cassettes,as they transform and attack the crows nest.
on rumble,as he starts PILE DRIVER MOTION on Crows Nest windows
rumble,First we crack the shell.    Then we crack the nuts inside.
blaster,We got Cassette Critters knockin' on the window!
on rumble,as he CRACKS THROUGH GLASS and he and others swarm in and attack Perceptor who tries to beat them away
perceptor,"Run, Blaster! Save yourself!"
blaster,No way. Two can play!
on blaster,"as he spews out CASSETTES which TRANSFORM into CUBBIE, a lion, STRIPES, a tiger, STINGER, a scorpion and BOLTS, a small, tough robot."
blaster,Sic 'em!
on rumble,"as Cubbie takes him down by the foot, turning him over and over"
on stripes,"as he SNAPS at Ratbat who screams and darts, trying to escape as we move to"
perceptor,You think you got through to Prime?
blaster,Let's hope so! Cause if I didn't we're gonna look like burnt out toaster ovens!
megatron,Constructicons merge for the kill!
springer,Great! Megatron's making his big push and we can't even push...  ...back!
kup,"Keep at it, Springer, lad! Help's at hand!  Together now!"
daniel,"also leans against it, his small legs churning."
the catapult,starts moving easily now.
arcee, I was afraid you'd be trapped outside the city walls.
hot rod," Hey, I wasn't worried for a micro-second, Arcee!"
arcee," Then you probably didn't understand the situation. Before Hot Rod can react, Kup steps back from repositioned Catapult"
kup,That did it!
daniel,"Kup, Hot Rod! Look! "
on devastator,"as he rises up and starts FIRING, HAMMERING, TEARING AWAY at metal shields which create armored walls of the transformed City."
springer,I got better things to do today than die. 
devastator,and explode harmlessly as Devastator continues to grunt and tear off armored layers of the city. He grabs Hot Rod and Kup and starts to crush them.
arcee,Hot Rod!
optimus prime,Dinobots.    Destroy Devastator!
grimlock,"Uhhhh! Me Grimlock love challenge! Dinobots, transform!"
dinobots,"transform into humanoid mode, and, with Grimlock at the front... ...fly out of the shuttle in wedge formation, blasting in unison."
follow dinobots,"In as they transform again and, in dino mode, swoop over to Devastator..."
devastator,Roars towards the Dinobots.
their battle,shakes the Earth...
prime,Megatron must be stopped. 
megatron,as he commands his troops.
megatron,Their defenses are broken.    Let the slaughter begin.
megatron,Prime!?
prime,smashing through a wall of lesser Decepticons.
prime,"One shall stand, one shall fall."
megatron,Why throw away your life so recklessly?
optimus prime,That's a question you should ask yourself.
megatron,"hurls himself at Optimus Prime... .... both tumble into the walls of the City... ...denting the walls and causing the electronic panels inside to short circuit, surrounding them with a fiery nimbus of crackling electrical energy."
hot rod,We've got to save Prime! Punching...
kup,"That's his fight, lad!   Stay away. Shooting.."
megatron,"grabs a jagged, spearlike piece of steel and hurls it at"
prime,"The steel ""spear"" pierces his side and sticks in him as... ... he charges Megatron, ...dodging shots from Megatron's gun to... ...deliver a huge UPPERCUT which... ...lifts Megatron into the air so high that... ... "
25.,"CONTINUED: PRIME  his head butts sharply against overhanging concrete balcony, mashing him down..."
megatron,"lands and stealthily slips a laser dagger from his boot, turning and slashing at..."
prime,"as he comes for him, tearing... ...a gash across Prime's midsection, which spews smoke and sparks and..."
megatron," Farewell, Prime!"
optimus prime,"as he lifts chunks of broken concrete and catches the laser dagger on it, tossing it aside as he lunges at-"
megatron,who claws his fingers and digs them into Prime's eyes
megatron,"I'll rip out your optics! Optimus grabs Megatron's clawed hand in one of his hands, twists it in see-sawing test of strength which... Optimus wins in a judo toss which sends Megatron - - skidding face first through steel rubble, in a shower of sparks until he crashes into the side of the city."
hot rod,"That's showing him, Optimus!"
kup,knocks two Decepticons on their tails and turns.
kup,"Finish him off, Prime!   Do it now!"
on megatron,as he spots a gun on the ground ahead of him
megatron,"No more, Optimus Prime!    Grant me mercy, I beg of you!"
optimus prime,"You who are without mercy now plead for it. I thought you were made of sterner stuff, Megatron!"
prime,"Out of the way, Hot Rod."
on megatron,firing blaster again and again
megatron,Fall!   Fall!
megatron,"I would have waited an eternity for this. Crawl, slave! On your knees!"
optimus prime, Never!
hot rod,Optimus!    Forgive me!
megatron, Enshrine me!
starscream," Take this scrap to Cybertron! Astrotrain, transform and get us out of here!"
arcee,The Decepticons are retreating.
kup,Prime did it. He turned the tide! He shoots  into...
the autobots,"fire after them, closing ranks on the shuttle, and pouring shots into the melee."
starscream,"Astrotrain, take off."
optimus prime,"as he lies on an improvised bier-like platform, a profusion of electricity discharging tubes and ""plasma"" bottle devices hooked up to his arms and into his gaping middle wound."
scanners,emit bleeps and show oscilloscopic patterns but sounds and wave patterns are steadily growing weaker and weaker.
perceptor,"is bent over Prime, in microscope mode, examining him... He then transforms and straightens up, his voice strained and cracking with emotion."
perceptor,"I fear the wounds are...  INTERCUT TO HOT ROD, KUP, ARCEE, DANIEL AND OTHER AUTOBOTS as they react."
optimus prime," Autobots...do not grieve... Soon, I shall be one with the matrix."
optimus prime," Ultra Magnus! It is to you, old friend, I shall pass the matrix as it was passed to me ...."
magnus,"Prime, I'm just a soldier.   I'm not worthy."
optimus prime," Nor was I, but one day, an Autobot shall rise from our ranks and use the powers of the Matrix to light our darkest hour."
optimus prime, Until that day...
astrotrain,"Jettison some weight, or I'll never make it to Cybertron."
starscream,"Fellow Decepticons, Astrotrain has requested that we lighten our burden!"
bonecrusher,"In that case, I say it's survival of the fittest."
starscream,So I hear a second on that?
healthy decepticons,Aye!
starscream,And against?
starscream,The ayes' have it!
starscream," Oh, how it grieves me to do this."
megatron,"Wait, I still function!"
starscream,Wanna bet?
starscream,"Well, as Megatron has, how shall we say - departed. I nominate myself as the new leader."
scrapper,"The Constructicons form Devastator, the most powerful robot. We should rule."
soundwave,Constructicons inferior.   Soundwave superior.
bonecrusher,Who are you calling inferior.
hook,Nobody would follow an uncharismatic bore like you.
rumble,"Hey, nobody calls Soundwave uncrazmatic."
frenzy,Yeah!     Let's kick tailgate.
the constructicons,"try to form Devastator, but..."
hook,"Constructicons, unite!"
blitzwing,I am a triple changer. I am worth any two of you. I should run things.
dirge,Death comes to anyone who crosses me. He attacks Blitzwing.
astrotrain,Stop squabbling or we're gonna crash.
unicron,"Welcome, Megatron."
megatron, Who said that?
unicron,I am Unicron.
megatron,Show yourself!
unicron,I have summoned you here for a purpose.
megatron,Nobody summons Megatron!
unicron,Then it pleases me to be the first.
megatron,State your business.
unicron,Bring me the Autobot Matrix. It is the one thing - the only thing that can stand in my way.
megatron,You have nothing to fear. I have already crushed Optimus Prime with my bare hands.
unicron,You exaggerate.
megatron,"The point is, he is dead!   And the Matrix died with him."
unicron,No. It has been passed to their new leader. Get it for me.
megatron,Why should I? What's in it for me?
unicron,"Your bargaining posture is highly dubious, but very well, I will provide you with a new body, and new troops to command."
megatron,And...
unicron,And nothing.
megatron,I belong to nobody.
unicron,Perhaps I misjudged you. Proceed on your way to oblivion. The Mist appears and starts to dissolve Megatron.
megatron," No, no. I accept your terms.   I accept!"
unicron,"Excellent! Behold - Galvatron! X-ray images: wiring, circuitry, etc. flash on and off as a new and larger being starts to form, changing from dented Megatron to a huge, new creation: Galvatron."
galvatron,Long live Galvatron!
unicron,And these shall be your minions...
scourge,"SCOURGE  is bearded, fanged and ferocious looking and as soon as he has been CREATED, he roars and stretches and an ARRAY OF SIMILAR CREATURES - smaller and all wearing dark and matching uniforms - are INSTANTLY CREATED FROM OTHERS behind him"
unicron,"Scourge, the tracker....and his huntsmen...the Sweeps...."
unicron,"Cyclonus, the warrior...and his armada....."
galvatron,To Cybertron!
unicron, Bring me the Autobot matrix! DURING UNICRON'S COMMAND we CHANGE ANGLE TO SHOW
galvatron,"I will rip open Autobot after Autobot until it is yours, Unicron."
other decepticons,in neat ranks but their grim expressions show their displeasure.
starscream, Get on with the ceremony! Dirge and others react to EERIE SOUNDS and look up and off. Starscream looks where others are looking and reacts.
starscream,Who disrupts my coronation?
galvatron,Coronation? This is bad comedy!
starscream,"Megatron, is that you?"
galvatron,Here's a clue!
galvatron,He transforms back to robot mode and confronts other Decepticons boastfully.
galvatron,Will anyone else attempt to fill his shoes?
galvatron,Galvatron.
unicron,"Bit by bit, we see new    sections of the planet being generated.    Then, the sinister mist we saw at    the beginning of the film starts pouring    out."
unicron,"A strange, LOUD HUM fills the air and the ground heaves and SHAKES beneath their feet"
jazz,Where'd that come from?!
cliffjumper,Who cares? I'm more worried about where it's going!
jazz," Talk to me, Earth! We got a situation out here!"
blaster,He reacts to muffled transmission from Jazz.
blaster,"I'm pickin' up a faint signal! BLASTER TRANSFORMS to blaster mode and Jazz's VOICE is broadcast loud and clear causing Springer, Arcee, and Daniel to react"
cliffjumper,And it's attack...
ultra magnus,Jazz!   Cliffjumper!
jazz,"Got ...to....blast free....if we can..... They get in and start retro blasters, the flame of blasters whirling in wild winds as moon is engulfed."
another angle,Suddenly it is pulled deep into Unicron.
galvatron,How dare Unicron?!  Cybertron and all it's moons are mine!
scourge,"But remember, WE belong to HIM!"
galvatron," I....will obey, Unicron! Decepticons, to Earth! The torture stops and Galvatron clutches his throat and tries to regain his composure as we..."
spike,"It's like a terrible nightmare, Ultra Magnus."
bumblebee,This thing - this juggernaut just ripped the first moon to shreds.
spike,And it's heading this way.
bumblebee,We'll try 'n slow it down...
spike,"But you'd better get here fast because... Suddenly, static obscures the transmission."
daniel,Dad!
ultra magnus,"Autobots, prepare to board the shuttles. This new menace is more dangerous than all the Decepticons put together. Somehow we must destroy it before it devours Cybertron."
daniel,But what about my dad? He's on the moon between that monster and Cybertron.
ultra magnus,"Daniel, I'll do everything I can for Spike."
hot rod,"And what are we going to do when we get there? If that thing crunches moons, it'll make short work of us."
ultra magnus,Maybe the Matrix can stop it.
hot rod,You're right! It can.
kup,What do you know about it lad?
hot rod,It's just a feeling.
kup,Look!
ultra magnus,To the shuttles!!!
galvatron,"There is no escape. I, Galvatron will crush you just as the magnificent Megatron crushed Prime!"
ultra magnus,And you'll die trying just like Megatron! Ultra Magnus fires Laser and hits Galvatron.
galvatron,aaaaaaaah!     Autobot cur!!
cyclonus,You want me to gut Ultra Magnus for you?
galvatron,There are plenty of Autobots for you. Ultra Magnus is mine!
arcee,"Stay close to me, Daniel..."
hot rod, And you better stay close to me... Arcee pulls Hot Rod toward her before he gets hit by laser
arcee,"No, you'd better stay close to me. Blurr is trying to get Grimlock into Shuttle with the rest of the Dinobots as Decepticon FIRE COMES IN ALL AROUND. Grimlock is like a ""spooked horse"" refusing to be shut in the barn."
blurr," Nice Dino, good, Dino, sweet Dino! Won't you step into the nice spaceship for Blurr? Please, pretty please."
grimlock," Me, Grimlock, not ""nice Dino!"" Me bash brains!"
grimlock,He gives FIRE BREATHING BLAST AT JETS as they go by STRAFING THE
ultra magnus,"as Kup, Hot Rod and Arcee MOVE INTO SCENE BEHIND HIM"
ultra magnus,"Kup, Hot Rod. Get the Dinobots out of here!"
on scourge,"as he TRANSFORMS to Humanoid mode and shouts orders, FIRING AT Blurr who BLURRS PAST and then at Arcee who also SHIPS BY"
scourge,No survivors!
kup,"This reminds me of the battle on Alpha 9, when the Petro-Rabbits were..."
grimlock,"Me, Grimlock, love Kup's war stories!"
kup,You're living one now!  Engage the boosters for Cybertron's sake! Hot Rod nods and quickly passes his hand over bank of SWITCHES all of which GLOW AND PULSE with the action.
another angle,"as DECEPTICON FIREBALL COMES UP and SPLATTERS AGAINST WINDOW, sending tongues of fire running across the glass behind Hot Rod's head"
hot rod,You got 'em!
grimlock, Tell Grimlock about Petro-Rabbits again.
kup, I'll give you Petro-Rabbits. Contact! The Shuttle lurches and shakes
cyclonus,Vaporize them!
springer," Looks like we're shipmates, squirt!"
daniel,All right!
springer,"But if you get space sick, you're gonna walk home."
ultra magnus,Hurry!
47.,CONTINUED:
springer,Jump.
on arcee,still going up the ramp while the shuttle slowly leaves the ground.
daniel,That was close!
springer,"Believe it or not, this is the fun part."
ultra magnus,No time to preheat....Can this ship take it?
perceptor,With an accelerated ignition procedure the ceramic housings might create a magnetic flux.
ultra magnus, What?
springer," He says ""go for it!"""
hot rod,gives the thumbs up gesture.
another angle,INCLUDING Ultra Magnus' shuttle through side port as Springer gives thumbs up signal in return and Daniel waves
on springer,"as he turns and reacts, looking straight up and ahead"
springer,It ought to be smooth sailin' from here on in.
astrotrain,Fuse them!
kup, Ultra Magnus...what next?
ultra magnus,Remember what we did off Beta Four!
kup,I remember it well.
galvatron's ships,which swerve to avoid them as....
galvatron's ship,emerges from the chaos.
cyclonus,The explosions jammed my sensors.  I have lost track of the Autobots!
galvatron,Damn it!! They did the same thing to me off Beta four!
shuttle,Possible song - optimistic adventure with the suggestion that all dreams might not happen.
kup,"Yep, I remember the dust was so thick off Beta 4 had to use windshield wipers on your optic sensors...."
grimlock," Me, Grimlock, know all about wipers! Want to hear good part of story!"
swoop," Good part, Kup! Tell Swoop good part!"
sludge,SLAG  Good part...tell
51.,CONTINUED:
kup,"Okay, Okay. The dust was really thick and then this gigantic Ick Yak..."
hot rod,Don't you think we have better things to do now than tell stories Kup?
kup,Like what?
hot rod,Like maybe figure out how we're gonna stay alive.
hot rod," Time out, for Cybertron's sake!"
auto combatant," Time out, time out, time out! Suddenly, the shuttle rocks from impact and SPARKS and flames shoot out of large hole in wall"
ultra magnus,Kup! Raise your force fields at once! They're armed with.....
hot rod,They're closing on us!
kup,"Yep, like the shrikebats of Dromedon!"
hot rod,"Yeah, how'd you beat them?"
kup,I'm trying to remember...there were an awful lot of casualties that day...
hot rod,"Okay, so you were right."
kup,Don't run your programs until they're debugged.
hot rod,They're coming back.
kup,Let's just hope we've screwed up their trajectories.
hot rod,Whew!!!
54.,CONTINUED:
kup,"Yep, I thought we'd had it that time for sure."
hot rod,Dive!
another angle,crushing the area between Hot Rod and Kup.
springer,Kup and Hot Rod just bought it!
ultra magnus,I can't deal with that now.
springer,"Face it, Magnus, the Decepticons 're gonna dog us until they see us dead! Ultra Magnus nods solemnly"
ultra magnus, Then that's exactly what they're gonna see.
on galvatron,as he works controls which eject more Moleculon Missiles.
cyclonus,The Autobots have been terminated!
galvatron,"Excellent. And soon we shall say the same of that infernal Unicron. Suddenly, Galvatron's body begins to twist, and he writhes in pain."
arcee,Did we have to detonate three- quarters of the ship?!
springer,"Seeing how they would have detonated four quarters, I think it was a good choice. SUDDEN SHUDDER AND THE SHIP DROPS SHARPLY, all holding on to each other and to any protruding handhold"
ultra magnus,Perceptor....can you still locate the Junk Planet?
perceptor,"Gamma waves in this sector of space create marginal navigation probabilities, however..... "
ultra magnus,Holds his head in his hands as Springer grimaces
perceptor,Ahem.....yes I think I can.
hot rod,"still cartwheeling down toward the planet below, trying to change the angle of his fall"
hot rod," Kup....Grimlock?   Slag!....Anybody? WE FOLLOW him through undersea world as he rounds a ""corner"" of the Reef Wall and reacts"
hot rod,Kup!
the squid,angrily streaks toward Hot Rod.
hot rod,"Fires at the Squid, but not stopping him."
another angle,"Hot Rod's shot plinks off a couple of tentacles, but the squid keeps coming..."
the squid,"releases a laser print ink stream which boils out in the water in a series of dots and ""x"" shapes and retreats."
hot rod,"Don't worry, I'm not coming after you."
hot rod,"lowers his head and blows blast of air through head-piece. The air blast clears the water, revealing Kup's head and torso half buried in the ""sand"""
hot rod,Kup!   Say something!
kup, Fix me!
hot rod,"Sure, Kup....right away! Hot Rod rapidly PULLS KUP'S SCATTERED BODY PARTS TOGETHER."
hot rod,"Well...what do you think? Kup feels his elbow joint, twists his neck side to side and gets creaks and squeaks and moves legs in odd, creaky way as he is trying himself out."
kup, There's a piece missing.
hot rod,"No way....  See, this wasn't yours...it's some kind of prehistoric ion cruncher....and this doohickey looks like a funky energon funnel... and this..."
59.,CONTINUED:
kup," But all things considered, you did an amazing job, lad! Amazing!"
hot rod, Really?
kup," Yeah, you even got rid of a nasty burr on my rotator! Now, let's find the Dinos and get off this twisted planet!"
on kup,as he transforms it's evident that a fender is misplaced and a wheel mounted improperly so it wobbles and he rides unevenly with much chugging and oil spewing
kup,Don't act hostile. I'll use the universal greeting.
hot rod,Universal Greeting.
kup,Watch.   I'll have them eating out of my hand.
hot rod,Or our faces.
kup,Bah-weep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong...
hot rod, Bah-weep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong... The Sharkticons look interested.
kup,"See, the Universal Greeting works every time.  Now, without making any sudden moves, give them an Energon goody. Kup reaches into his belt, presses a button and pulls out an Energon cube. Hot Rod, somewhat suspicious of the whole process does the came."
hot rod,This is getting expensive.
kup,"Don't worry, they'll reciprocate. They each hand out three Energon goodies to the remaining six Sharkticons... The Sharkticons eat them happily. Then, they back off, eyeing the two Autobots with menace."
hot rod,I thought they were supposed to reciprocate.
kup," Customs vary from place to place. Suddenly, the Sharkticons transform to their vicious mode and lunge at them."
the quintessons,"slender, spindly framed robotic creatures with oversized five sided heads, each side bearing a different mechanistic face with a different expression on each - smiling, angry, grimacing, suspicious and the fifth face is not yet to be seen. As Hot Rod and Kup are led to certain death in the Quintesson dungeons, harsh, dissonant, metallic and terrifying music plays, underscoring the brutal evil they face,"
hot rod,Every place reminds you of some place else.....
hot rod,A lot of good it's done us so far!
hot rod,I can't transform!
kup,"They're restraining bolts, lad."
hot rod, We got to get a new travel agent.... What is this place?
kranix,"The world of the savage Sharkticons and their cruel masters the Quintessons. They hunt down those who try to escape the wrath of Unicron, and put them on trial."
kup,But what if they're innocent?
kranix,"Guilty or innocent, the sentence is always the same - death!"
hot rod,Unicron?!    Who's Unicron?
kranix,A planet six times the size of this one that absorbs everything in its path.
kup,So that's the monster's name.
hot rod,I wonder if there's any connection between it and Galvatron.
quintesson guard,"Soon, you too shall receive your sentence."
lead quintesson,"Jury, have you reached a verdict?"
lead quintesson, Guilty.....Or innocent. I repeat.
kranix,Spare me this mockery of justice.
lead quintesson,"I repeat, guilty...or innocent."
jurors,Guilty!!
kup,"Not the end I'd wish for, lad."
daniel,"Where are we, Springer?"
springer,The place where everything ends up after you throw it out.
ultra magnus,Brace for impact!
springer, Remind me to give the Auto Pilot a raise... Daniel creeps out from under Arcee and shakes bits of broken metal and dust off his shoulders
daniel,Wow! That was better'n the Roller Coaster at Future World!
perceptor, The composition of this planet seems to be a chaotic amalgam of discarded ferrous and non-ferrous articulations.
ultra magnus, How's that?
springer, He says the planet's made of junk.
springer,"Yep, this dump is a dump......"
ultra magnus,as he straps on TOOL BELT
ultra magnus,We might be able to salvage this thing.  Ultra Magnus starts for door followed by Blurr who takes up a saw and tool belt and Perceptor who rolls up Shuttle Plans as Daniel moves out to join them
66.,CONTINUED:
daniel,"Can I help, too?"
springer,"It's rough out there, kid. Stay inside and play with crayons or something."
arcee,"as she steps forward with a smile, a strange GRID LIKE ""SUIT"" in her hand"
arcee,I think Daniel can make himself useful with....this! It used to be Spike's. 
daniel,Wow! Dad's exo-suit. He told me about it but I never saw it.
arcee,"Here, try it on."
on daniel,"as he gets inside the ""suit"" which fits over his body like a grid-work metal ""cage."""
springer,Just think about what you want to do before you do it!
daniel,"brows knitted, thinking."
springer,Don't fight it Dan-O.
daniel, It's kind of tricky....
arcee,"For the first time out, you were great!"
springer,Show time's over! We've got work to do! 
other junkions,"Yeah, or your money back! Wreck-Gar shows large JUNK GUN with all sorts of razor sharp fins and rusty little rocket missiles mounted around the howitzer like barrel"
quintesson,"Greetings, noble strangers."
grimlock,"Yes, me, Grimlock, noble! Me, Grimlock search for friends."
quintesson,And who might they be?
grimlock,Autobots.    Hot Rod and Kup.
quintesson, Oh yes. A young one and an old one.
grimlock,Yes.   You know friends.   Where are they?
quintesson,They went down that path. He points to...
a path,"It probably isn't lined with primroses, but it should be."
grimlock,"GRIMLOCK You good friend to Grimlock.    I reward you, sometime."
69.,CONTINUED:
galvatron,Why do you torture me?!
unicron,You have failed.
galvatron,"No, Unicron. Ultra Magnus is dead."
unicron,Then where is the matrix?
galvatron,"Destroyed, with him."
unicron,The matrix can not be destroyed.  And Ultra Magnus lives on the planet of Junk. Stalk him. Cut him open! And bring the matrix to me.
grimlock,"Me Grimlock, positive Hot Rod and Kup close! Get thump, thump, thump... "
slag,"Me, Slag say you are full of beryllium balony. He is just about to fall in when..."
grimlock,"Me, Grimlock, say you full of cesium salami! Slag gets up..."
slag,Beryllium balony!
grimlock,Argh!
grimlock,"Me, Grimlock think trees here are cheap model."
slag,"Like your head!  Grimlock jumps on Slag and wrestles him to the ground. Suddenly, a SQUEAKY, ODDLY CHILDISH VOICE speaks from o.s."
grimlock, Who say that?
wheelie,Friends find. Look behind.   Many Face lie. You fool! You buy!
grimlock," Me, Grimlock, ""fool?"""
wheelie, Grimlock raises a claw to swipe Wheelie off Slag's head
grimlock,"Me, Grimlock, no like you!"
on wheelie,"as he scowls and quickly loads FIRESTONE IN SLING and slings it onto Grimlock's nose where it EXPLODES making Grimlock yowl and pull back, feeling his reddened nose and speaking through his nose angrily"
grimlock, Doooooooow! Why boy hit by dose?
wheelie, Grimlock and Slag react as we
quintesson judge,"Before we deliver your verdict, would you like to beg for your lives?"
kup,Remember when you put me together today?
hot rod," Sure, that's all I got to think about."
kup,I know what part you forgot.
hot rod,I have nothing but contempt for this court.
73.,CONTINUED:
kup,"That doohickey you lost was part of my shoulder socket. Watch this, lad... without it, I'm double jointed as Houdini."
hot rod,Wish you'd figured that out a little sooner.
kup,Better late than never!
hot rod,They've got more Sharkticons than we have photon charges!
kup,"Let's hold a demolition derby! Then, he roars into a bunch of them, slamming a massive stack into the wall."
hot rod,Didn't even bend a fender.
kup,"Yeah, but look. There are a lot more of those cam dinging, grill-crackin' things."
hot rod,"We can't hold out forever, but we can give them one whopper of a repair bill."
grimlock,"Lowers his teeth to devour a much smaller Sharkticon, the Sharkticon bares his teeth, realizes that he's a second stringer, and scampers away."
grimlock,"Me Grimlock want to munch metal! Slag barrels into Sharkticons, making a quick shishkebob out of them, while..."
the sharkticons,suddenly back off and begin transforming  to the dinobots.
hot rod,I never thought I'd be so happy to see those big bozos.
grimlock,Me Grimlock no bozo.   Me king!
quintesson judge,Sharkticons! Execute them.
grimlock,Me Grimlock say execute them.
the sharkticons,"for a brief instant, don't seem to know what to do. Then, they charge the Quintessons."
the chase,"The Quintessons start to flee, but it's clear that the Sharkticons, who climb over the stacked bodies of other Sharkticons, are going to catch them."
kup,I think the problems on this planet will be solved very shortly.
hot rod,But what about our problems.    We need a ship.
wheelie,WHEELIE You get a ship if I get a trip.
hot rod,Who are you.
slag,"Him Wheelie, him friend."
hot rod,"HOT ROD He'll be mine too, if he can find a Quintesson ship."
hot rod,That's a ship?
spike,"If this doesn't do it, nothing will."
bumblebee,"now with a new bumpersticker which is a Unicron with a red circle and slash through it, looks very fidgety."
bumblebee,Let's get out of here.
the spaceship,takes off.
on unicron,His mist surrounds the planet...
bumblebee,"Five, four, three, two, one..."
bumblebee,It isn't even dented.
spike,Let's get out of here!
on unicron,"The great Maw opens and we hear a grand cosmic roar! Suddenly, the smoke and space junk from the explosion are sucked into his mouth."
78.,CONTINUED:
spike,We're being sucked into it!
perceptor,Be sure the fittings are securely welded!
blurr," Absolutely, positively, definitely..."
daniel,This exo-suit is fantastic!  Want me to do that?
blurr,"Weld? You? Really? Well, why not? Give it a try, but think it through first! Daniel knits his brow, extends FINGER OF EXO- GLOVE which is part of exo-suit."
blurr,"Practice, practice, practice!"
ultra magnus,"as he, too, hears and then looks up and sees the Decepticon force"
ultra magnus,Decepticons!  We've got to draw them off and then double back to the ship!
springer,Cancel that last order.
daniel,What do I do?
blurr,Transform! You can do...  ...it!
on daniel,"as he reacts, looks around, thinks, brows knitting, looking off, reacting"
daniel,Transform....
on scavenger,as he starts reaching for Daniel
scavenger,Human germ!

sweep,He lets out a rayblast...
ultra magnus,Perceptor!
on perceptor,He transforms to humanoid mode.
perceptor,It appears that my lacerations were primarily superficial.
ultra magnus,Then move it...
ultra magnus,"Stays behind, taking a few shots at..."
sweeps,which streak over in deadly formations.
ultra magnus,He stands and shoots.
ultra magnus,Then use that time to escape! The Matrix was designed for an emergency like this. I'll try to unleash its power.
springer,But what if it doesn't work.
ultra magnus,Until all are one!
ultra magnus,Damn it!   Open it!
ultra magnus," Prime, you said the Matrix would light our darkest hour."
galvatron,"Sweeps, quarter him!"
galvatron,"Unicron, my ""master,"" with this I shall make you my slave!"
daniel,as he moves out and looks down at Ultra Magnus' remains
daniel, Ultra Magnus!
blurr,Without the Matrix there is no hope.   No hope at all!
springer,Get gone!

the junkion,"goes flying off his motorcycle.,, He transforms into a motorcycle as The motorcycle transforms into a rider and hops on the new motorcycle and then..."
on springer,"He looks over, astonished."
springer,It's not hard to knock 'em down. It's getting them to stay down that's the trick.
on arcee,"as she fires at a Junkion who is trying to swerve her off the road knocking him off the motorcycle... The Junkion looks down at his missing arm, digs around in the junk for a minute, comes up with another, and then transforms to a motorcycle."

perceptor,Perhaps they're not as vicious as they look.
on springer,reacting to Wreck-Gar's noises and eyeball display
springer," Positive thinking gets    on my nerves. Suddenly, all react to    sound and wind of passing space cruiser    their P.O.V- HOT ROD, KUP AND DINOBOTS    IN CRUISER as it shoots past and banks,    coming back for a closer look"
daniel,as he looks up at passing Cruiser and waves
daniel,And Kup and the Dinobots!    We're saved!
perceptor,I wouldn't count on that! 
kup,Not since the Crocodillos of Strontero have I seen such a sight....
grimlock,"Maybe they make me king, too!"

hot rod,Where did you learn to talk like that?
the watchman,On it is a crazy Eddy-type commercial.
kup,looks around nervously.
kup,"I talk some TV. And now, Hot Rod for the news. Don't touch that dial. Void where prohibited. JUNKIONS cheer wildly while the Dinobots react with uncertainty"
ultra magnus,You're all alive...
hot rod,The matrix!
ultra magnus,It's gone...
kup,"And with it, all hope."
hot rod,No...  The matrix will not fail us.
arcee,Didn't you hear Ultra Magnus. We don't have it anymore. Galvatron does.
hot rod,"Then we've got to trust in ourselves, and no matter what they odds, destroy Unicron."
junkions, Destroy Unicron... Kill the grand poobah... Flush cosmic troubles down the drain.
springer,"Listen,   I don't want to rain on anybody's parade,   but how are we going to move the army to   Unicron. We don't have enough room on   that ship."
ultra magnus,You have ships here?
springer,What's he talking about?
springer,This is what I call traveling in style.
unicron,Aren't we getting pompous?
galvatron,"I now possess that which you most fear. Unicron LAUGHS and the force of it rocks the surface of the planet, knocking Galvatron to his knees."
galvatron,"You will do my bidding, or... Unicron roars with laughter."
galvatron,...taste my wrath.
unicron,You underestimate me Galvatron.
unicron,"For a time, I considered sparing your measly little planet, but now you shall witness its dismemberment!"
galvatron,No!!!
shockwave,Decepticons...we're under attack...Scramble - Then his voice is cut off as...
galvatron,"GALVATRON Stop feeding him, you fools!"
hot rod,I don't believe it.
daniel,Wow!
kup," Nope, never seen anything like it."
hot rod,I knew there had to be a first time....  Battle stations!
unicron's chest,"Galvatron, the matrix hanging around his neck. Transforms to Cannon and fires up at... ... A bright panel on Unicron's chest..."
other junkions,Or your money back!
closer,... tears it in half.
junkions,Free bonus surprise!
the cruiser,"Is suddenly struck by a ray from Unicron's eye, and half of it is knocked off."
daniel,Where's Hot Rod?
springer,Sees something in the distance.
springer,"I don't know, but I hope they didn't get him."
kup,Debugoids!
arcee,Quick!   This way.
hot rod,The Autobot Matrix!
galvatron,"It will do you no good, Autobot.   It cannot be opened."
hot rod,Not by a Decepticon.
galvatron,It is strange that we should find ourselves as allies...
on galvatron,"Suddenly, his body is violently twisted, and his arms are almost broken off."
galvatron,Uhhhh...
unicron,"Destroy him, or feel yourself torn from limb to limb."
galvatron,"Of course, my master!"
on galvatron,He peers into the gloom.
on galvatron,Weapon drawn.
galvatron,"Puny Autobot, you lack even Prime's courage. There is no response."

daniel,Help...
arcee,Daniel!
daniel,I'm okay.    They don't even see me.
kup,They must not programmed to catch flesh creatures.
springer,"Us, on the other hand..."
arcee,Daniel... Try to find help! Arcee fires...
unicron's stomach,"This is the central processing area for Unicron's ""food"" and ""energy."" A long conveyer belt drops junk into a clear, bubbling vat, where it is separated into raw material and energy. The energy, which comes out in raw form, goes into a machine and is crunched into energon cubes, while the solid material, is separated into it's component metals and plastics, formed into ingots and sent elsewhere in an assembly line fashion."
daniel,watches this with awe until he sees...
on daniel,He dashes to the shores of the glowing lake...
daniel,Cliffjumper! Jazz!
daniel,Bumblebee!     Dad!
spike,"Shut off the control, Daniel. Daniel looks around."
a control,..     which controls the whole thing.
on daniel,He runs up a catwalk towards it....
daniel,What do I do? It doesn't have any buttons or anything.
spike,"Shoot it, Son."
daniel,But I don't have a gun.
spike,Use your exo-suit.
cliffjumper,Hurry!
daniel,Starts frying the command console!
daniel,I can't stop it!
daniel,turns around and sees this.
daniel,Dad!
spike,Son.
spike,You did it!
galvatron,"Come out, Autobot. We all must die sometime."
galvatron,stumbles backward.

galvatron,"No, I will crush you with bare hands. Hot Rod transforms back to car and tries to race away... ... Galvatron jumps after him and catches him... ... Hot Rod, nearly pinned by Galvatron transforms to humanoid mode."
galvatron,"First Prime, then Ultra Magnus and now you. It is a pity Autobots die so easily or I might have a sense of satisfaction now. Hot Rod desperately gasps and pulls at Galvatron's hands..."
hot rod,Gasps.
galvatron,Die!
another angle,"On Hot Rod, his hands, nearly dead, spring to life for a moment and grasp the Matrix which hangs from Galvatron's chest."
another angle,A miraculous transformation takes place. ... Hot Rod begins to grow at an alarming rate. ... Age shows on his face. ... He is stronger and wiser.
optimus prime,"Arise, Rodimus Prime."
hot rod,Optimus!
galvatron,Nooooooo!
hot rod,"This is the end of the road, Galvatron. With that, he picks up the Decepticon and throws him through..."
springer,"I'm almost out of energy. Suddenly, he looks up and sees one of the creatures explode above"
springer,That's what I call the nick of time.
jazz,Let's burn rubber!
kup,"I knew you had potential, lad!"
rodimus prime,"Autobots, transform and roll out. Rodimus Prime transforms into truck mode as the other Autobots also transform. Daniel and Spike jump into him. Then, in a continuous line, he shoots off, the other Autobots racing behind him."
rodimus prime,Let this mark the end of the Cybertronian wars as we move forward to a new age of peace and happiness....
all,Until all are one!
