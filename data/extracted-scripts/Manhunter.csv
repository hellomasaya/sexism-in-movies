Speaker,Dialogue
second draft,"July 20, 1984"
crawford,I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
graham,"I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon."
crawford,How much do you know?
graham,What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
crawford,Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
graham,What else did you keep out of the papers?
crawford,"Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive."
graham,Somebody hurt him?
crawford,Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
graham,No.
crawford,Why not?
graham,The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
crawford,And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
graham,"You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack."
crawford,"Last two like this we had, you caught."
graham,That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
crawford,"That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think."
graham,I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
crawford,You look all right now.
graham,I am all right.
graham,As long as they're dead...
crawford,"These are all dead, Will."
pictures," If we expected gory crime photos, these are not them. Two snapshots: a woman followed by three children and a duck carrying picnic items up a bank of a pond. A second family behind a birthday cake at a table. They're all smiling."
molly,He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
graham,What did he want?
graham,And you said?
molly,"I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone."
graham,"I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything."
molly,You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
graham,"We have it good, don't we?"
molly,All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
graham,What the hell can I do?
molly, What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
graham,If I were?
molly," That's selfish, huh?"
graham," I don't care. (beat> He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence."
kevin,Will it keep them out?
graham,Yeah. ..
kevin,How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
graham,In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
kevin,"Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?"
graham,"Yeah, but not now.. These will all make it... guaranteed."
molly,"Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?"
crawford,I have to.
molly,"You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?"
crawford,Because it's his bad luck to be special.
molly,He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
crawford,"Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it..."
molly,"You wouldn't like it, either if you had it."
crawford,"Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?"
molly,No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
crawfrod,I'LL try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
graham, Thanks for the lift.
officer,"I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone."
graham,That's right.
offtcer,"There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for They transferred the home movies of both families once half-inch VHS."
graham's feet, walk through the kitchen as if he knows where he is going. A thermostat clicks and air conditioning comes on loudly. Graham's feet pass our of frame...
graham,"intruder entered through kitchen sliding door. Probably a glass cutter. Why didn't he care that he left AB saliva on the glass? it was hot out that night. inside, the house must' have been pleasantly cool to him. "
graham,There's a wicker dog bed on the back porch. There's a doghouse in the back yard. Where's the dog?
graham," Three bloodstains on the east wall, not from Mr. Leed's arterial spray. What did killer do after they were dead?"
graham, Molly?
graham,"It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you..."
graham, The powder they found came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off
graham,"Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?"
graham,He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
graham,"Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes."
springfield,Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
graham,The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
springfield,Why do you think he took his gloves off?
graham,"Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?"
springfield," 'Intimate? !"""
graham,Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
springfield,All right. House to house interviews will be extended four additional blocks. R & I has loaned us two clerks to help cross-matching airline reservations between Birmingham last month and between Atlanta now.  Dr. Princi.
springfield,Investigator Graham has worked this kind of thing before. Can you add anything?
springfield,Can't hear you. Can you come up to the front?
graham,He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
springfield,"He only bit women so far, right?"
graham,That's all we know about. 
springfield,What's average?
graham,Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.
springfield,"All right. Vice and Narcotics, take the K-Y cowboys and the leather bars. Marcus and Whitman heads up at the funeral. The rest of you, your assignments are on the sheet. Let's go."
springfield,"One more thing: I've heard officers referring to the killer as the 'Tooth Fairy.  Yeah, yeah, but I don't want to hear that in public or internal memoranda. That's it."
springfield," We don't have shit, and we know it."
springfield," He killed nine people, didn't he?"
graham,Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
springfield,What happened to them?
graham,One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
springfield,What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecter?
graham,Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
springfield,What would you call him?
springfield,To yourself...
graham,I call him a monster.
springfield,I understand he cut you pretty good...
graham,(cold right turn> What about the dog?
springfield,It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
graham,Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
springfield,No.
graham,Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
crawford, A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat. Neighbors are watching for it.
graham,Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard... maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
crawiiord,"Jimmie, it's me, Jack Crawford, and you got Will Graham here."
crawford,Can you make an identification off it?
graham, senses Springfield's staring at him. Graham's face is blank. He leaves. Springfield -- shaking Crawford's hand -- watches Graham all the way to the door.  CUT TO:
lounds,Will Graham! Remember me? Freddie Lounds? I covered the Lecter case for the Tattler. I did the paperback... !
lounds," When did they call you in, Will? What have you got?"
crawford,"Lounds, give it a rest..."
lounds,"Come on, Graham?! Talk to me!"
lounds,How does this guy compare with Lecter? How does he do them?
graham, Keep the fuck away from me!  Crawford is pulling on Graham. He can't budge him. Graham lets go.
crawford," Get the hell away from here, Lounds! CUT TO: INT. DINER, BOOTH - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - DAY Graham is staring into the black deep recesses of his coffee. Crawford is looking at him. Finally:"
graham,"...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls..."
crawford,I know...
graham, Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
crawford,Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
graham,"I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me."
crawford,You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print. ..
crawford,What's one way?
graham,"We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him."
crawford,"We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?"
graham,He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
crawford,No other possibilities?
graham,You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?' That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about. 
crawford,Why?
graham,"Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack."
crawford,See? You do know something about him.
graham, ... I'm going to see Lecter.
crawford,"For Christ's sake, why?"
graham, To recover the mind set.
graham,"Hey, baby! Where are you?"
graham,None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
graham,Tell me about yourself.
graham,"Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it..."
graham,Z don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
graham,I have to see somebody.
graham," Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow."
graham,"Blue, then."
graham,"Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit- brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and..."
graham,"Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby. .."
graham,I love you...
graham,I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
graham,No.
graham, I want to see Lecktor now.
lecktor,That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
graham,I keep getting it for Christmas.
graham,I got it. Thank you.
lecktor,And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
graham,Stuart is fine.
lecktor,"Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?"
graham,No.
lecktor,"Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot."
graham,Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
lecktor,And?
graham,"Very interesting, even to a layman."
lecktor,"A layman.., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'"
graham,You've read the transcript. It's all there.
lecktor,No it's not. Do you know how you Did it Will?
lecktor," It doesn't matter to me, Will."
graham,"I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor."
lecktor,"Yes, I thought so."
graham,It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
lecktor,Yes .
graham,"You read about it, I'm sure."
lecktor,"In the papers. I don't rear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?"
graham,I thought you would have some ideas.
lecktor,Why should I tell you?
graham,There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
lecktor,"Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  Never mind, it's boring."
graham,You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
lecktor,Pray tell.
graham,I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
lecktor,"Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me."
graham,No. I knew that I'm nor smarter than you are.
lecktor,"Then how did you catch me, Will?"
graham,You had disadvantages.
lecktor,What disadvantage?.
graham,You're insane.
lecktor,"You're very tan, Will."
lecktor,"Your hands are rough. They don't look like a cop s hands anymore. That shaving lotion is something a child would select. It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it?"
lecktor,Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
graham,"I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best..."
lecktor, Do you have the file with you
graham,Yes.
lecktor,Pictures?
graham,Yes.
lecktor,"let me have them,, and I might consider it."
graham,No.
lecktor,"Do you dream much, Will?"
graham,"Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor."
lecktor,You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
lecktor,let me have the file. Then I'll tell you what I think.
graham,sits in the chair. He wants a cigarette. He doesn't take one. He waits. And he watches. What he sees:
lecktor,What were the yards like?
graham,"Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?"
lecktor,"Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it. Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing."
graham,That's interesting.
lecktor,It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
graham,Yes. I'd considered it.
lecktor,"You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?"
graham,I want your opinion.
lecktor,I don't have one right now.
graham,When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
lecktor,May I keep the file?
graham,I haven't decided yet.
lecktor,"I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number?"
graham,No.
lecktor,"Do you know how you caught me, Will?"
graham,"Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file."
lecktor,Do you know how you caught me?
eileen,Mr. Dollarhyde?
dollarhyde,"Yes, Eileen."
dollarhyde,And?
eileen,On the densitometer it came out within tolerances.
dollarhyde,"Thank you, Eileen."
lecktor,Thank you so much. I'll call you when I'm finished.
lecktor,"Can I have the number of Dr. Sidney Bloom, University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry, please?  Dr. Sidney Bloom, please."
lecktor,What's his secretary's name again...?
lecktor,"Hi, Linda. .."
lecktor,Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
lecktor,I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
lecktor, I'LL bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
lecktor,"Well, zip that little Pointer right on down to the letter G."
lecktor,We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Ms. Will Graham.
lecktor,"Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too"
lecktor,Thank you very much.
stewardess,Clears the trays.
graham," Block her off, Mitch..."
molly smiles," as she rips the head off the shrimp. The warm mouth, Her shiny teeth look like a Pepsodent commercial."
graham's eyes,"In horror. And O.S., we hear SCREAMING coming from a differ- ent place as we... CUT TO:"
tray, The file has spilled open. Crime photos of the Leeds and Jacobi families with mirrors in their eyes and the almost separated head of Mr. Jacobi glaring at a weird angle -- the pornography of it all -- are spilled across Graham's tray and in his lap...
graham," mumbles apologies, scrambles to collect crime photos. The mother wants her seat changed."
geehan,"It was last Thursday. This couple from Duluth. I had them down to the short strokes talking mortgages -- I mean, that man could have written a check for the whole goddamn place. I'm figuring: Geehan , you lucky sonofabitch, you gonna unload this turkey.  Off they go in their Sedan DeVille the hell out of here."
graham,Have any single men asked to look at it?
geehan,"Haven't asked me.  You can drop that key in the mailbox. You don't have to come back by, do you?"
graham,Uh-uh.
jacobi backyard, And turned earth where the cat was found.
a symbol, is carved in the wood.
graham, photographs this as well as a branch that's been trimmed by a cutting tool. Then he looks...
geehan,They don't build houses this way anymore: solid lath and plaster construction. None of your drywall stuff and aluminum studs here. No sirree Bob!
wife,"I like it, hon."
husband,Let's go to your office and see if we can work out some terms...
geehan,Great. You goin' love this house!
geehan, has deflated against the doorframe.
graham,I'm sending the can to Jimmie Price to dust for prints.  I need Bowman in Documents to fall on this carving. Then I need the Firearms and Toolmarks Section out here on the severed branch. I need to know what kind of cutting tool he used.
crawford,Is it weird?
crawford,If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
crawford," ... bur if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?"
sarah,"He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham ""broken mirrors.""'"
crawford, Will. Get right back here. He just called.
graham,Who did he ask for?
crawford,"Thanks, no."
graham,"...so how do I play him, Sidney?"
crawford,... very little. If it's all electronic switching we'll need a minute for the trace.
sarah," Bill, call back on twenty-four four. We need to keep this line clear..."
crawford,Where the hell's Graham!
sarah,He went to the men's room.
crawford,For Christ's sake get him!
sarah,"Special Agent Crawford's office.  Could you hold on a second, I'll see if I can find him.  Sarah punches hold. Crawford is counting seconds. He raises his thumb. Graham grabs the phone."
graham, No. I can help you.
graham,I don't understand.
graham,Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
graham,Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
graham,He's right-handed.
graham,He's misunderstood.
graham,He's very strong physically.
graham,He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
graham,"I don't want to do that,"
graram,"Will Graham, FBI."
graham,You tell me. You have a man in custody?
graham, Yeah. I'm preferring charges! Obstruction of justice. You lock that asshole up. You hold him for the U.S. Attorney! You...
lounds,"Will, listen..."
guard,Dr. Chilton.
guard,"When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book.. We got him out of there and dug around..."
guard,Yeah. It's right here.
guard,No.
sarah,Special Agent Crawford's office.
sarah,"Speak up, please. I can hardly hear you!"
sarah, I'm sorry. Special Agent Crawford and Graham are tied up tight now. Can I get them to call you back?
crawford," Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!"
graham, What is it?
sarah,"It's a Dr. Chilton, sir. He says it's urgent."
graram,It's Will Graham...
graham,Where did you get it?!
crawford," Run along to the police station, Freddie. We'll talk to you when we get around to it...  Crawford punches into Dr. Chilton's call.  CUT TO:"
cbawford,"Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up."
graham,After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
graham,How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
crawford,"Have your building superintendent shut off the water and most of the lighting in Lecktor's hall. Have him walk through carrying tools and being pissed off or something,"
crawford," Brian. We have a note coming in on the fly. Possibly from the Tooth Fairy. Number one priority., It has to go to Hair and Fiber, Latent Prints and Documents. Graham and I will be walking it through..."
beverly katz,"One hair, Graham. Maybe a thirty- second of an inch. A couple of blue grains. I'll work it up. What else have you got?"
graham,Hair from Lecktor's comb. Whiskers from an electric razor they let him use. This is hair from the cleaning man.
bowman, How long do I have?
crawford,Twenty minutes max.
graham,The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
bowman,That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
bowman, moves under a rostrum camera setup. There are lights mounted on a 360-degree rim even with the base of the rostrum Bowman hits a switch. The top lights go out. The side lights are very oblique.
lighting panel," Bowman's fingers hit it. The room is darkened, except for a dull glow from the infrared source.."
bowman," You're so sly, but so am I..."
rostrum, Bowman switches to a closed-circuit TV camera.
monitor, The image focuses as Bowman focuses the lens. Then: The ink smear is gone. Fragments of writing appear.  BOWMAN  At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r.
graham,We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
graham,Personal ads?  As they run out of the room:  CUT TO:
crawford,The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
bowman,When do they go to press?
graham,In thirty-five minutes.
bowman,Christ!
crawford,"After we find Lecktor's response, we substitute our own. Somewhere tomorrow night the Tooth Fairy will actually buy Tattler, looking for Lecktor's message. Here's what he'll find, Bill."
bill, 'Dear Avid Fan: inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements. Mementoes for you at Baltimore
crawford,It's a Secret Service letter drop and stakeout. He shows: we take him.  Anything from Chicago?
sarah,Not yet.
crawford,Let's get to the physical.
price,There was no print. I'm here for kicks .
beverly katz,One whisker. Scale counts and core size match Hannibal Lecktor's. So does color. The color's different than the Tooth Fairy's taken in Birmingham and Atlanta. Three blue grains and some dark flecks went to Brian's end.
brian zellar,The grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine. Must be from the cleaning man. There are several particles of dried blood. Not enough to type.
graham,Bowman?
bowman,It's Snow White toilet paper. National distribution.
bowman, I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it.
crawford,Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
graham,"Will Graham, Jack Crawford..."
graham,Read it.
graham,That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
cbawford,Christ...
crawford, Cryptography at Langley?
sarah,They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
bowman," And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him."
crawford,Book code?
bowman,'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
cbawford,Not the Bible?
bowman,No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
graham,Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
bowman,Right .  What about sweating Lecktor?
graham,They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
bowman,it has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
graham,He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
crawford,"Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place..."
bowman,Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
crawford,Where?
bowman,Library of Congress.
graham,Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
crawford," We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week."
graham,Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
crawford,Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
graham,"And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon ."
crawford,"It's your call, Will. What do we do?"
graham,Run it.
crawford,What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
graham,We will feel sick for a very long time.  CUT TO:
graham,Who is it?
graham,What'd it say?
graham,Tell me now.
graham,Get me a plane...
graham,Get me a plane!
graham,I won't be here.
kevin,Mom. ..
molly,What time is it?
kevin,"Mom, someone's outside. There's noises ..."
molly, Go into your room and lock the door.
molly,Go ahead!
molly," breathless, opens the door. Fast."
trooper,"Are you all right, ma'am?"
molly, What's going on
door, opens. Running down the stairs and across the tarmac is Will Graham in shirtsleeves with a Car-15 assault rifle with collapsible stock. His eyes scan the perimeter.
fbi men," moving fast, follow Graham. Their eyes sweep the terminal area. One carries an Uzi submachine gun, the other two, handguns."
house interior,Holiday Inn decor.
molly,"Who decorated this place, Richard Nixon?"
graham,"...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you."
molly,"You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  He's after you now, isn't he?"
graham,It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
kevin,"I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom..."
graham," He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?"
molly,He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face .
graham,Good for him.  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping .
kevin,Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
graham,No. You're very well-protected. No one can find our where you are.
kevin,Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
gbaham,Yes .
kevin,I figured I'd ask you...
kevin,"I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?"
graham,We don't know that.
kevin,Are you gonna kill him?
graham,No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
kevin,How did it happen?
graham,Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
kevin,How?
graham,With a knife.
kevin,You went in the apartment?
graham,Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
graham,"I kept thinking there must be some way I could have handled it better. It kept replaying in my mind. Later I got depressed. A doctor friend of mine, Dr. Bloom, asked me to go into a hospital. After a while I got some distance on it and was okay."
kevin,Did the girl die?
graham,No.
kevin,She got all right?
graham,...after a while.
kevin,And Hobbs died?
kevin,Killing somebody feels that bad?
graham,Kevin: it's the ugliest thing in the world.
kevin,What kind of coffee do you like?
graham,Huh?
kevin,"You like that Colombian stuff, don't you?"
kevin,"Mom likes that, too."
molly,"It's hard to have anything, isn't it? Rare to get it, hard to keep it. This is a damn slippery planet."
graham,Slick as hell.
molly,You remember when we first met? And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
graham,I remember.
molly,Do you remember what you said?
graham,Yes. I said this is too good to live...
molly,"Time is luck, Will.  I know the value of our days..."
molly,Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.  CUT TO:
crawford,I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
bloom,What about him?
crawford,I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
bloom,"Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now."
crawford,That was Peterson upstairs.
bloom,It was you who did the asking.
crawford,He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
bloom,I wouldn't presume to try.
crawford,"You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on- one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?"
bloom,"He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.   But I don't think he's psychic.   What he has it empathy and projection  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him."
crawford,Why aren't you ever alone with him?
bloom,Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  What do you want?
crawford,His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
bloom,I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
crawford,That's when it happened?
bloom,"No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box. When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy? '  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown."
crawford,What's the bottom line?
bloom,"If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?"
crawford,Could he handle a direct contact?
bloom,I don't recommend it.
bloom,Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
graham,"If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot. "
gxaham,I'll use Lounds.
graham,"Sidney, he doesn't read the ""Sunday Times literary supplement. He reads Lounds in the ""Tattler.""  And I want this over with... Fast."
lounds,"How does he rate compared to Dr, Hannibal Lecktor?"
graham,He's not as intelligent.
graham, What have we missed?
bloom,"He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead. I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr, Leeds."
lounds,How long will you stay in Washington?
gbaham,Until we've taken out the Tooth Fairy.
graham,All right. Let's shoot the pictures .
lounds, I want shots with me and Graham together .
lounds,"C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. You want this to look real, don't you?"
graham,"Keep the motel sign across the street just slightly out of focus. He has to be able to read it, but it can't look too obvious."
crawford, That mean anything to you?
graham,No.
spurgen,"...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?"
graham,Pretty well.
spurgen,"I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog."
spurgen,"Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them?"
graham,Glaser Safety Slugs?
spurgen, Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads. Body armor?
graham,Kevlar Second Chance.
spurgen,I hope you have a second chance...
graham,Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
spurgen,You got it.
graham,Let's walk the route.
newsstand operator, What is it?
newsstand operator,You'll have to wait until I bust a bundle.
newsstand operator, I said wait 'til I bust a bundle. Understand?
newsstand operator,Hey. Hey you.
dollarhyde,Me?
newsstand operator,"Yeah, you. Fuckin' told you..."
dollarhyde, You told me what?
dollarhyde,You told me what?!
newsstand operator,You got a quarter comin' back.
graham," ... walking along the determined line, fifty yards from the apartment building.., hears something through the delicate patter of the rain."
graham's face, in anticipation. The foot beats are getting LOUDER...
gbaham's eyes, like taut wire about to snap.
runner," is knocked off balance and slams face forward into the side of a car. He comes off the car violently, to turn, to fight ..."
graham, God-dammit!!!
runner,Arrest dat sucker...!  Crawford catches up to Graham:
crawford,"You okay?  Graham shoulders past Crawford He throws the Kevlar vest across the parking lot. He almost killed the man. Meanwhile, Spurgen is with the Runner."
spurgen,It was a mistake . Sorry we...
runner,'Sorry' yo' mama!!  Runner pissed off -- starts towards Graham. Spurgen stops him.
spurgen,Hold on! We thought you were someone we're trying to catch...
runner, I get dat cannon stuck up mah face?! Car dirt splattered up and down mah Calvin Kleins?!
secretary,"See you, Freddie."
lounds,Was I in an accident?
lounds,"My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned."
lounds,"Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth."
lounds,What am I doing here?
lounds,I don't want to know.
lounds,Yes .
lounds,I'm very scared.
lounds,Yes .
lounds,I don't know...
lounds,I'd do a big story. Anything you want to say. Describe you any way you want or no description!
lounds,No. I don't want to see you.
lounds, turns away. The shape of Dollarhyde passes behind his head. The kimono is on again.
dollarhyde,Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun. Do you see?
lounds,Yes ...
dollarhme,Do you see?
lounds,Yes .
dollarhyde,Do you see?
lounds,Yes.
dollarhyde,"Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?"
lounds,Yes .
dollarhyde,Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
lounds,Yes .
dollarhyde,Freddie Lounds. Your photograph.
lounds,"Oh, God."
dollarhyde,Do you see?
lounds,"Please, no."
dollarhyde,'No' what?
lounds,Not me.
dollarhyde,Are you a man?
lounds,Yes.
dollarhyde,Do you imply that I'm a queer?
lounds,"God, no."
lounds,No.
dollarhyde,Before me you are a slug in the sun. You are privy to a great becoming and you recognize nothing. You are an ant in the afterbirth.  We have one more piece of work to do.
lounds," Didn't take off the mask. Please, God, let him not take off the mask. If he comes back with it off, I'm dead..."
dollarhme's hand," carries a tape recorder. We PAN it across the room to Lounds' face . DOLLARHYDE  Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.  Lounds obeys."
dollarhyde,Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
lounds,"'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now. About his work. About his becoming.'"
dollarhyde's hand,turns off the tape recorder.
dollarhyde,You did very well.   I apologize for the crude images.    Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights .
lounds,You'll let me go now?
dollarhyde,You will tell the truth?
lounds,"Absolutely,"
dollarhyde,Good .  We'll seal your promise with...
dollarhyde,... with a kiss.
lounds,"Go 'head and kill 'ee, you 'astard! You rot in 'ell. rot in 'ell!"
parking attendant, reads. Now the wheels SQUEAK and ECHO LOUDER. His head raises again...
molly,Can I have one of your cigarettes?
graham, You haven't smoked in two years.
molly,"I'd like one of your cigarettes, please."
molly,Have you ever omitted telling me. things before?
graham,No.
molly,Then why?
graham,I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
molly,Can you quit?
graham,No.
molly,And... where are things?
graham,Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
molly,What will you do?
graham,I have to go back to Birmingham.
molly,Is Crawford going with you?
graham,No. I have to be. in there... alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
molly,William: you are going to make yourself Sick or get yourself killed.
molly,Kevin and I have lived through... with Kevin's father... once before... and we can't...
graham,You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
molly,Will
graham,Molly.  I love you. And I'm not really going to be fit to be with for awhile...
gbaham,"Sidney: I don't understand him. We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience. To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming' ...but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this."
graham,And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper? In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
graham,"Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.  Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!"
graham,"I'm sorry, too..."
waitress,Excuse me...?
graham,Coffee ...
graham,"It's just YOU and me now, sport. And I'd better hurry up and find you.  Because I'm losing all this..."
dollarhyde,"Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock."
reba,Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
dollarhyde,Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
reba,What's being photographed?
dollarhyde,The activities of nocturnal animals.
reba,When do you need it?
dollarhyde,In eight days.
reba,Let me stick this in the black hole.
reba,The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code .  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
dollarhyde,It'll do fine.
dandridge,"Reba, dear, I've got to fly.  Mr. Dollarhyde, if it wouldn't be too much trouble could you help her home ?"
reba,"I can 'help' myself home, Ralph..."
dollarhyde,I'LL take you.
beba, I'LL order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
dollarhyde,Ride with me.
reba,"Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time."
dollarhyde,Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to.
reba,It's better if I rake your arm.
reba,Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
dollarhyde,Tonic will be fine.
reba,In the kitchen.
dollarhyde,How did you come to Gateway?
beba,They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
dollarhyde,You worked out well.
reba,"You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children..."
dollarhyde," reacts to ""speech therapy."" Characteristically -- his attention goes to:"
reba,I'll probably go back to it someday.
dollarhyde,Uh-huh.
reba,May I touch your face?  I want to know if you're smiling or frowning. I want to know if I should just shut up or not...
dollarhyde,Take my word for it that I'm... smiling .
rzba,"If I've offended you, I didn't mean to."
dollarhyde,I have to go now.
reba,Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
dollarhyde,It's a surprise.
reba,Francis? We're at the zoo...!
reba, Yes!
reba,"No, no! I want to."
reba's hand, The fur springs between her fingers.
tiger's head, Reba's hand gently touches the tiger's ears and both hands feel the width of his head.
tiger's mouth, The hot breath coming across its rough tongue stirs the hairs on her forearms.
tiger's chest, Reba's arms wrap around the huge chest. Slowly her face lowers and she puts her ear next to the tiger's ribs. Reba's ecstatic. We hear what she hears: the HEARTBEAT. It fills us and Reba with its bright thunder.  CUT TO:
dollarkyde,I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
reba," unknowing, is suffused with a calm equanimity. Her breasts rise and fall with her breathing. The flickering light from the screen intermittently illuminates and darkens the planes of her face."
dollarhyde, is watching her pulse rise and fall under the soft skin and doesn't see:
reba, moves towards Dollarhyde's face.
reba, Take me upstairs...
dollarhme," wide awake, eases her away. Then he puts his ear to her breast and listens to her heart beating. Dollarhyde is re- lieved. Then Dollarhyde touches her gently, softly in wonder and amazement. Then Dollarhyde leaves..."
reba," Dollarhyde re-enters FRAME and puts a glass of water next to her. He covers her. He lays down again next to her. Reba stirs half awake, murmurs dreamily. Dollarhyde supports the back of her head and offers her some water."
dollarhyde,"Yes, are you okay...?!"
reba, In her cotton dress. The prairie wind blows her hair and presses the thin cotton against her body in the overgrown weeds and wildflowers of Dollarhyde's backyard.
reba,"Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee..."
dollarhyde,No! Don't go back into the house...  it's too nice outside.
reba,"My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?"
dollarhyde,I have work to do at the plant.
reba,I'll get my purse.
dollarhyde,I'll get it.  Stay right here. You lock very good in the sun...
dollarhyde,"Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?"
reba,"I'm fine, Francis."
dollarhyde,"Fill it up and check the oil, please."
driver's window," Dollarhyde appears. As he starts to reach for his wallet on the dash, he sees what the Attendant's doing..."
attendant, unaware of Dollarhyde -- is grinning and still wiping the same spot in front of Reba.
dollarhyde,You sonofabitch...
attendant, You don't like it? You know what you can do about it...
reba's face, through the windshield. She's trying to find the handle to roll down the window.
attendant," is white. There is something in Dollarhyde's face that he has never seen before, anywhere."
dollarhyde, pulls the spout from the oil can that was in his engine. He advances on the frozen Attendant. He looks at the sharp end of the spout.
dollarhyde,"I ought to jam this in your chest, and drain your heart..."
graham,I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
graham,What's it narrow down to?
graham, That's narrow?
graham,When I'm done.
graham,"It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?"
graham,"Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too..."
graham,Yes. Is Molly there?
graham,I know... 'Out in the good air...'
graham,Tell her I called.
gpaham,This is Will Graham. Dr. Chilton arranged for me to talk with Dr. Lecktor .
lecxtor,I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are. Will.
graham,What do you want?
lecktor,You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
graham,"I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it."
lecktor,"I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us. Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?"
graham,Fight what?
lecktor,"When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!"
graham,I don't believe in God.
lecktor,"You should, Will. God's terrific!  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders."
lecktor,"It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful..."
lecktor, God's a champ! He got a hundred and sixty Philippines in one plane crash two months ago... Remember the big earthquake in Italy last spring...?
craham,I see you there. I breathe in the perfume of this room. I am in the inner sanctum of a life. You will accept me. Take me into you.
dollarhyde,No.
dollarhyde,No!
dollarhyde,I want her! I want her alive... I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
dollarhyde,Reba ...
dollarhyde,The developing room.  I need to... see you.
dollarhyde, No. Reba...?
dollarhyde, I'll see you later. All right?
dollarhyde, Yes .
dandridge,There's something on your face.
reba,What was it?
dandridge,Pollen .
reba,Thanks for the ride.
dandridge,See you tomorrow.
reba,Who is it?
reba,Who?
reba,Francis.. .?
the moon, It's full and very large as it dawns over black water that seems to ripple and be drawn to it. PULL BACK to reveal we are:
graham,"He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors. I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important."
crawford,'Changes?'
graham,It's a word. Killing them...  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
crawford,"VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?"
graham,How do I know?!
graham,"He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses,  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him."
crawford,There's no connection between the families.
graham,There has to be.
crawford, There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times .
graham, He's a very shy boy...
crawford,What?
graham,Something Lecktor said.
crawford,"Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it. You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh. .."
graham,It's not over yet.
crawford,"It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM. The full moon is tonight."
crawford,Will?
graham, You wanna watch this or what?!
graham,That's why the boltcutter.
crawford,What's that?
graham,He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
crawford,Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
graham,You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
crawford,He had to.
graham,Donald Jacobi's eleventh birthday party was April fourteenth. Sometime between April fourteenth and May third they changed the door.  But you can't see either family's door from the street. He wouldn't know until he got to the house that the padlock wasn't there anymore...
crawford,It's getting late and...
graham, Don't talk to me!!
graham,It's Graham. The Jacobi stuff is still in the storeroom?
graham,Have one of the guards down there call me.
graham,Do it.
graham, You knew that was the Jacobis' cat ...
graham, You brought a boltcutter... 'cause you thought there was a padlock...
graham," And the Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar... But you know it's the Leeds' dog, don't you, my man?!"
graham, See the woman?
graham,"The bloom on the woman. You can almost feel her.  You can see her again and again. Anytime you want.  Haven't you, my man?"
crawford,It's the guard in the storeroom.
graham, They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
crawford, There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows.
crawford,He found them...
graham," What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri."
crawford, Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
crawford, No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
crawpord, See if there's another label underneath.
graham,"It does, doesn't it?"
crawford, At Meigs have them warn up and flight-prep the Gulf Stream.
reba,... You're scaring me with this.
reba, Why are you doing this?!
reba,The Tooth...
reba,It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
dollarhyde,Now you know how the Dragon kills...  CUT TO:
technician,Try it...
crawford," This is Jack Crawford, FBI. Who am I speaking to?"
crawford, All we know is this man owns a van and he works at Gateway. We have physical characteristics...
graham,Parking permits...
crawford, Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
crawford, Start feeding me names.
graham, No.
crawford, Next ...
pilot, Could you fasten your seat belts. We're on our final approach...
graham, Put it through the datafax. Fast.
graham," Route three, Chester, Missouri. Where is that?"
crawford, Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
graham, This is our boy...!
dollarhyde," stands four feet from her, just staring. Then he walks from the room.  INT. DOLLARHYDE'S LIVING ROOM - DOLLARHYDE  puts ""INNAGADDADAVIDA"" by Iron Butterfly from 1967 on the stereo. It BLASTS through the house. He is expressionless. Deep in his psychotic episode, his affect is flattened."
officer,Meet point's up ahead!
graham,Go on to the house.
officer,Lt. Fisk said...
graham,Go on to the house...
car floor, Glaser Safety Slugs roll on the rubber matting. Graham's fingers enter and pick them up. We FOLLOW the rounds as they slip into the cylinder.
crawford,is staring at Graham's blankness.
crawford,Will?
graham, What?
crawford,You're not going to need that. Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us.
tires, spray the gumbo mud out of the furrows. The forward momentum of the car slows until it completely stops. The tires spin and dig in.
graham, spills out and starts running for the house and the orchard a quarter mile away. Crawford follows.
crawford, Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach. Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
graham,How far away's the back-up?
crawford,Three minutes.
graham,I'll cover the back.
crawford,Stay in the trees.
graham," There's somebody in the house, Jack"
graham," It's happening again, Jack..."
graham, ... stop it.
graham, STOP IT!!!  Dollarhyde turns to the window in time to see:
graham's face, is lacerated from the glass. He sees his own blood on the floor. He struggles to rise. The first thing up is the
graham," bleeding, brings the .44 down from the recoil of the first shot. Now, up on one knee, he FIRES FOUR more rounds into Dollarhyde."
graham, Hello.
molly,I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
graham,Mama was probably asleep.
molly,Will? Are you okay?
graham,Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
molly,"I want to see you, too."
graham,Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
molly,Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
graham,Come home with me.
molly,"Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days..."
graham,What's this Mama shit?
molly,It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
graham,"What's the problem, Molly?"
molly," They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too."
graham,"Small difference: I'm not dead, yet ."
molly,Will?  You could come up here.
graham,"They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you. But they don't want to see me..."
molly,That's not true.
graham,Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick...
molly,Maybe we should give it some time...
graham,Yeah. That's great. A little time.  See you around.
driver,Twenty-three twenty-six..- Twenty- three twenty-eight. Here you go.
sherman," Cut out the basketball and go back to the algebra,"
tina,I'll get it.
sherman,What do you want?
graham,Are you George Sherman?
sherman,Yes. Who are you?
grahaei,My name's Will Graham. I...
sxerman, Honey...!
graham,"No, that's okay...  How are you?  There's a searching look on Graham's face. Totally strange."
sherman,We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  ... how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?
graham,"No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ... stop by and..."
sherman,"I can't thank you enough, I..,"
graham,I just wanted to stop by and... see you... I guess. That's all.
george sherman, closes the door. There's an awkward look on his face. He didn't get to say what he wanted to say to Graham.
molly,Let's forget who said what to whom...
graham,You got a deal...
molly,So how'd we do...?
graham,We did okay.  Most of them made it...
