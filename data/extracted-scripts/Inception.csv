Speaker,Dialogue
shooting script,FADE IN:
attendant, Show him.
security guard, He was carrying nothing but this...
security guard,...and this.
cobb,A bacteria? A virus?
cobb,An intestinal worm?
arthur,What Mr. Cobb is trying to say-
cobb,An idea.
cobb,"Resilient, highly contagious. Once an idea's taken hold in the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate. A person can cover it up, ignore it- but it stays there."
saito,But surely-to forget...?
cobb,"Information, yes. But an idea? Fully formed, understood? That sticks...  In there, somewhere."
saito,For someone like you to steal?
arthur,"Yes. In the dream state, conscious defenses are lowered and your thoughts become vulnerable to theft. It's called extraction."
cobb,"But, Mr. Saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself from even the most skilled extractor."
saito,How can you do that?
cobb,"Because I am the most skilled extractor. I know how to search your mind and find your secrets. I know the tricks, and I can teach them to your subconscious so that even when you're asleep, your guard is never down."
cobb,"But if I'm going to help you, you have to be completely open to me. I'll need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife, your analyst, anyone.  If this is a dream and you've got a safe full of secrets, I need to know what's in that safe. For this to work, you have to let me in."
saito,Gentlemen. Enjoy your evening as I consider your proposal.
arthur,He knows.
arthur,What's going on up there?
arthur,Saito knows. He's playing with us.
cobb,I can get it here. The information's in the safe- he looked right at it when I mentioned secrets.
arthur,"What's she doing here, Cobb?"
cobb,You just get to your room. I'll take care of the rest.
arthur,See that you do. We're here to work.
mal,"If I jumped, would I survive?"
cobb,"With a clean dive, perhaps. Mal, why are you here?"
mal,I thought you might be missing me...
cobb,I am. But I can't trust you anymore.
mal,So what?
mal,Looks like Arthur's taste.
cobb,"Actually, Mr. Saito is partial to postwar British painters."
cobb,Would you sit down?
mal,Tell me...
mal,Do the children miss me?
cobb,You can't imagine.
mal,What're you doing?
cobb,Getting some air.
cobb,Stay seated. Please.
mal,"The gun, Dom."
mal,Please.
saito,"Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb."
cobb,"Did she tell you, or have you known all along?"
saito,That you're here to steal from me?  Or that we're actually asleep?
saito,I want to know who your employer is.
cobb,No point threatening him in a dream.
mal,That depends on what you're threatening. Killing him would just wake him up... but pain? Pain is in the mind...
mal,"And, judging by the decor, we're in your mind, aren't we, Arthur?"
nash,What're you doing?! It's too soon-
arthur,I know! We have to reconnect the loop before they wake up!
mal,He was close. Very close.
saito,Stop him!
arthur,I'm not going to make it! Wake Cobb!
nash,He won't wake!
arthur,Dunk him!
cobb,You came prepared.
saito,I bring the gun because not even my head of security knows this apartment. How did you find it?
cobb,Hard for a man in your position to keep a love nest totally secret... particularly when there's a married woman involved.
saito,She would never...
cobb,"And yet, here we are."
cobb,With a dilemma.
saito,You got what you came for.
cobb,"Not quite. The key piece of information wasn't there, was it, Mr. Saito?"
arthur,"They're getting closer, Cobb."
cobb,You held something back because you knew what we were up to...
cobb,So why let us in at all?
saito,An audition.
cobb,Audition for what?
saito,It doesn't matter. You failed.
cobb,I extracted all the information you had in there.
saito,But your deception was readily apparent.
saito,So leave me and go.
cobb,You know the corporation who hired us won't accept failure. We won't last two days...
arthur,"Come on, Cobb."
cobb,So now I have to do this the old- fashioned way-
saito,I've always hated this carpet.
saito,It's stained and frayed in such distinctive ways...
saito,But very definitely made of wool. Right now I'm lying on polyester.
saito,"Which means I'm not lying on my carpet, in my apartment...  You've lived up to your reputation, Mr. Cobb... I'm still dreaming."
todashi,How'd it go?
arthur,Not good.
saito,A dream within a dream-I'm impressed.
saito,"But in my dream, we really ought to be playing by my rules..."
nash,"Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito-"
cobb,We're not in your dream-
nash,We're in mine.
arthur,How could you get the carpet wrong?!
nash,It wasn't my fault!
arthur,You're the architect-
nash,I didn't know he was going to rub his damn cheek on it!
cobb,Lets go.
arthur,And you-what the hell was all that?
cobb,I had it under control.
arthur,I'd hate to see out of control-
cobb,There's no time for this-I'm getting off at Kyoto.
arthur,Why? He's not gonna search every compartment.
cobb,I can't stand trains.
arthur,I can keep him under for one minute-
cobb,Every man for himself.
cobb,"Hey, guys. How are you?"
cobb,Who's just okay? Was that James?
cobb,I can't. Not for a while.
cobb,"Well, James, like I've told you-I'm away because I'm working..."
cobb,"Philippa, can you ask Grandma to pick up the phone-"
cobb,"Well, we'll just have to hope Grandma's wrong about that won't we?"
james, Daddy?
cobb,Yes?
cobb,"No. No, we talked about this, James. Mommy's gone."
arthur,Our ride's on the roof.
arthur,Cobb... are you okay?
cobb,"Yeah, why?"
arthur,Down in the dream... Mal showing up like that ...
cobb,Yeah. I'm sorry about your leg.
arthur,"It's getting worse, isn't it?"
cobb,"One apology's all you're getting, Arthur. Now, where's Nash?"
arthur,Hasn't shown. Wanna wait?
cobb, We were supposed to deliver Saito's expansion plans to Cobol Engineering two hours ago. By now they know we failed. Time to disappear.
arthur,Where will you go?
cobb,Buenos Aires. I can lie low there. Maybe sniff out a job when things quiet down. You?
arthur,Stateside.
cobb, 'Course. Send my regards.
saito,He sold you out. Thought to come to me and bargain for his life...
saito,So I offer you the satisfaction.
cobb,That's not how I deal with things.
saito,Would you work with him again?
cobb,What will you do to him?
saito,Nothing. But I can't speak for your friends from Cobol Engineering.
cobb,What do you want from us?
saito,Inception.
saito,Is it possible?
arthur,Of course not.
saito,"If you can steal an idea from someone's mind, why can't you plant one there instead?"
arthur,"Okay, here's planting an idea: I say to you, ""Don't think about elephants.""  What are you thinking about?"
saito,Elephants.
arthur,Right. But it's not your idea because you know I gave it to you.
saito,You could plant it subconsciously-
arthur,The subject's mind can always trace the genesis of the idea. True inspiration is impossible to fake.
cobb,"No, it isn't."
saito,Can you do it?
cobb,I won't do it.
saito,"In exchange, I'll give you the information you were paid to steal."
cobb,Are you giving me a choice? Because I can find my own way to square things with Cobol.
saito,Then you do have a choice.
cobb,And I choose to leave.
saito,"Tell the crew where you want to go, they'll file the plan en route."
saito,Mr. Cobb...? There is one other thing I could offer you.  How would you like to go home? To America. To your children.
cobb,You can't fix that. Nobody could.
saito,Just like inception.
arthur,"Cobb, come on-"
cobb,How complex is the idea?
saito,Simple enough.
cobb,No idea's simple when you have to plant it in someone else's mind.
saito,My main competitor is an old man in poor health. His son will soon inherit control of the corporation. I need him to decide to break up his father's empire. Against his own self-interest.
arthur,"Cobb, we should walk away from this."
cobb,If I were to do it. If I could do it... how do I know you can deliver?
saito,"You don't. But I can. So do you want to take a leap of faith, or become an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone?"
saito,"Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb. And choose your people more wisely."
arthur,I know how much you want to go home-
cobb," No, you don't."
arthur,But this can't be done.
cobb,It can. You just have to go deep enough.
arthur,You don't know that!-
cobb,I've done it before.
arthur,Did it work?
cobb, Yes.
arthur,Who did you do it to?
arthur,So why are we headed to Paris?
cobb,We're going to need a new architect.
miles,No space to think in that broom cupboard.
miles,Is it safe for you to be here?
cobb,Extradition between France and the U.S. is a bureaucratic nightmare.
miles,I think they'd find a way to make it work in your case.
cobb,Can you take these back for the kids?
miles,It'll take more than the occasional stuffed animal to convince those children they still have a father.
cobb,I know. I thought you could talk to Marie about bringing them on vacation. Somewhere I could meet-
miles,Why would she listen to me?
cobb,You were married for twenty years.
miles,She blames me as much as you.
cobb,Doesn't she understand that my kids need me?
miles,"Yes, she does. We all do. Go back and face the music, Dom. Explain what Mal did."
cobb,"Be realistic, Stephen. They'd never understand- they'd lock me up and throwaway the key. Or worse."
miles,You think what you're doing now is helping your case?
cobb,Lawyers don't pay for themselves. This is what I have. This is what you taught me.
miles,I never taught you to be a thief.
cobb,"No, you taught me to navigate other people's minds. But after what happened with Mal there weren't a whole lot of legitimate ways for me to use that skill."
miles,"Why did you come here, Dom?"
cobb,"I found a way home. A job. For powerful people. If I pull it off, I can get back to my family. But I need help."
miles,My God. You're here to corrupt one of my brightest and best.
cobb,"If you have someone good enough, you have to let them decide for themselves. You know what I'm offering-"
miles,Money?
cobb,"No, not just money: the chance to build cathedrals, entire cities- things that have never existed, things that couldn't exist in the real world..."
miles,"Everybody dreams, Cobb. Architects are supposed to make those dreams real."
cobb,That's not what you used to say. You told me that in the real world I'd be building attic conversions and gas stations. You said that if I mastered the dream-share I'd have a whole new way of creating and showing people my creations. You told me it would free me.
miles,And I'm sorry. I was wrong.
cobb,"No, you weren't. Your vision was a vision of pure creativity. It's where we took it that was wrong."
miles,And now you want me to let someone else follow you into fantasy.
cobb,"They won't actually come on the job, they'll just design the levels and teach them to the dreamers."
miles,Design them yourself.
cobb,Mal won't let me.
miles,"Come back to reality, Dom. Please."
cobb,"You want to know what's real, Stephen? Your grandchildren waiting for their dad to come back.  This job-this last job-is how I get there."
cobb,I wouldn't be standing here if there were any other way. I can get home. But I need an architect who's as good as I was.
miles,I've got someone better.
miles,Ariadne...
miles,I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.
ariadne,Pleased to meet you.
miles,"If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb has a job offer to discuss with you."
ariadne,A work placement?
cobb,(smiles Not exactly.
cobb,A test.
ariadne, Aren't you going to tell me anything?
cobb,"Before I describe the job, I have to know you could do it."
ariadne,Why?
cobb,"It's not, strictly speaking, legal."
cobb,You have two minutes to draw a maze that takes me one minute to solve.
cobb,Go.
cobb,Stop.
cobb,Again.
cobb,Stop.
cobb,You'll have to-
cobb, More like it.
cobb,"They say we only use a fraction of the true potential of our brains... but they're talking about when we're awake. While we dream, the mind performs wonders."
ariadne,Such as?
cobb,"How do you imagine a building? You consciously create each aspect, puzzling over it in stages... But sometimes, when your imagination flies-"
ariadne,I'm discovering it.
cobb,Exactly. Genuine inspiration.
cobb,In a dream your mind continuously does that...
cobb,It creates and perceives a world simultaneously. So well that you don't feel your brain doing the creating. That's why we can short- circuit the process...
ariadne,How?
cobb,By taking over the creating part.
cobb,"This is where you come in. You build the world of the dream. We take the subject into that dream, and let him 111 it with his subconscious"
ariadne,But are you trying to fool him that the dream is actually real life?
cobb," While we're in there, We don't want him to realize he's dreaming."
ariadne,How could I ever get enough detail to Convince him that it's real?
cobb,"Our dreams reel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up we realize things were strange,"
ariadne,"But all the textures of real life- the stone, the fabric. cars... people... your mind can't create all this."
cobb,"It does. Every time you dream. Let me ask you a question: You never remember the beginning of your dreams, do you? You just turn up in the middle of what's going on."
ariadne,I guess.
cobb,So... how did we end up at this restaurant?
ariadne,We came here from...
cobb,How did we get here? Where are we?
ariadne,Oh my God. We're dreaming.
cobb,"Stay calm. We're actually asleep in the workshop. This is your first lesson in shared dreaming, remember?"
ariadne," If it's just a dream, why are you covering your-"
cobb,"And a face full of glass hurts like hell, doesn't it? While we're in it, it's real."
arthur,"That's why the military developed dream sharing-a training program where soldiers could strangle, stab and shoot each other, then wake up."
ariadne,How did architects get involved?
cobb,Someone had to design the dreams.  Let's go another five minutes-
ariadne,We were only asleep for five minutes? We talked for an hour at least...
cobb,"When you dream, your mind functions more quickly, so time seems to pass more slowly."
arthur,Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream.
cobb,Let's see how much trouble you can cause in five minutes.
cobb,"It's good. You've got the cafe, the layout... you forgot the book shop but pretty much everything else is here."
ariadne,Who are the people?
cobb,They're projections of my subconscious.
ariadne,Yours?
cobb,"Sure-you are the dreamer, I am the subject. My subconscious populates your world. That's one way we get at a subject's thoughts-his mind creates the people, so we can literally talk to his subconscious."
ariadne,How else do you do it?
cobb,"Architecture. Build a bank vault or a jail, something secure, and the subject's mind will fill it with information he's trying to protect."
ariadne,Then you break in and steal it.
cobb,Exactly.
ariadne,"I love the concrete sense of things-  Real weight, you know? I thought a dream space would be all about the visual, but it's the feel of things. Question is, what happens as you start to mess with physics..."
ariadne,"It's something, isn't it?"
cobb, Yes. It is.
ariadne,Why are they looking at me?
cobb,"Because you're changing things. My subconscious feels that someone else is creating the world. The more you change things, the quicker the projections converge on you."
ariadne,Converge?
cobb,"They feel the foreign nature of the dreamer, and attack-like white blood cells fighting an infection."
ariadne,They're going to attack us?
cobb,"Just you, actually."
cobb,It's beautiful... but if you keep on changing things...
ariadne,Mind telling your subconscious to take it easy?
cobb,That's why it's called subconscious. I don't control it.
cobb,"Arched stone, iron pillars... it's..."
cobb,"I know this bridge. This place is real-  You didn't imagine it, you remembered it..."
ariadne, I cross it every day on my way to the college.
cobb,Never recreate places from your memory. Always imagine new places.
ariadne,You have to draw from what you know-
cobb," Use pieces-a streetlamp, phonebooths, a type of brick-not whole areas."
ariadne,Why not?
cobb,Because building dreams out of your own memories is the surest way to lose your grip on what's real and what's a dream.
ariadne,Did that happen to you?
cobb,"Look, this isn't about me-"
ariadne,Is that why you need me to build your dreams?
cobb,Leave her alone-
ariadne,"Wake me up, Cobb."
cobb,"Mal, no!"
ariadne,Wake me up!
arthur,It's okay.
ariadne,Why couldn't I wake?
arthur,The only way to wake from inside the dream is to die.
cobb,She'll need a totem.
ariadne,What?
arthur,"Some kind of personal icon. A small object that you can always have with you, and that no one else knows,"
ariadne,"That's some subconscious you've got, Cobb.  She's a real charmer!"
arthur,Sounds like you've met Mrs. Cobb.
ariadne, She's his wife?
arthur,"So. A totem. You need something small, potentially heavy..."
ariadne,Like a coin?
arthur,Too common. You need something that has a weight or movement that only you know.
ariadne,What's yours?
arthur,A loaded die.
arthur,I can't let you handle it. That's the point. No one else can know the weight or balance of it.
ariadne,Why?
arthur,So when you examine your totem...
ariadne,That's not an issue for me.
arthur,Why not?
ariadne,"Arthur, maybe you can't see what's going on, maybe you don't want to. But Cobb's got problems he's tried to bury down there. I'm not going to open my mind to someone like that."
cobb,"I've never seen anyone pick it up so fast. And one reality won't be enough for her now. When she comes back, get her building mazes."
arthur,Where will you be?
cobb,I've got to talk to Eames.
arthur,Eames? But he's in Mombasa. Cobol's backyard.
cobb,Necessary risk.
arthur,There are plenty of other thieves.
cobb,We don't just need a thief. We need a forger.
eames,You never know.
cobb,Drink?
eames,You're buying.
cobb,You're spelling hasn't improved.
eames,Piss off.
cobb,How's your handwriting?
eames,Versatile.
eames,"Word is, you're not welcome in these parts."
cobb,Yeah?
eames,"There's a price on your head from Cobol Engineering. Pretty big one, actually."
cobb,You wouldn't sell me out.
eames,`Course I would.
cobb, Not when you hear what I'm selling.
cobb,Inception.
cobb,Don't bother telling me it's impossible.
eames,It's perfectly possible. Just bloody difficult.
cobb,That's what I keep saying to Arthur.
eames,Arthur? You're still working with that stick-in-the-mud?
cobb,He's a good point man.
eames,"The best. But he has no imagination. If you're going to perform inception, you need imagination."
cobb,You've done it before?
eames,"Yeas and no. We tried it. Got the idea in place, but it didn't take."
cobb,You didn't plant it deep enough?
eames,It's not just about depth. You need the simplest version of the idea- the one that will grow naturally in the subject's mind. Subtle art.
cobb,That's why I'm here.
eames,What's the idea you need to plant?
cobb,We want the heir to a major corporation to break up his father's empire.
eames,"See, right there you've got various political motivations, anti- monopolistic sentiment and so forth. But all that stuff's at the mercy of the subject's prejudice- you have to go to the basic."
cobb,Which is?
eames,The relationship with the father.  Do you have a chemist?
eames,There's a man here. Yusuf. He formulates his own versions of the compounds.
cobb,Let's go see him.
eames,"Once you've lost your tail.  Back by the bar, blue tie. Came in about two minutes after we did."
cobb,Cobol Engineering?
eames,They pretty much own Mombasa.
cobb,Run interference. We'll meet downstairs in half an hour.
eames,Back here?
cobb,Last place they'd expect.
eames,Freddy!
eames,"Freddy Simmonds, it is you!"
eames," Oh. No, it isn't."
cobb, Yes?
second businessman,We need to-
saito,"Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?"
cobb," What brings you to Mombasa, Mr. Saito?"
saito,I have to protect my investment.
eames,This is your idea of losing a tail?
cobb, Different tail.
arthur,He said you'd be back.
ariadne,I tried not to come.
arthur,But there's nothing else quite like it.
ariadne,"No paper, no pens... nothing between you and raw, direct creation."
arthur,Shall we take a look at paradoxical architecture?
arthur,You're going to have to master a few tricks if you're going to build three complete dream levels.
ariadne,What sort of tricks?
arthur,"In a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes.  That lets you create closed loops, like the Penrose Steps. The infinite staircase."
arthur,See...
arthur,Paradox. A closed loop like this helps you disguise the boundaries of the dream you've created.
ariadne,How big do the levels have to be?
arthur,"Anything from the floor of a building, to an entire city. But it has to be complicated enough for us to hide from the projections."
ariadne,A maze.
arthur,And the better the maze-
ariadne,The longer we have before the projections catch us.
ariadne,My subconscious seems polite enough.
arthur,"You wait, they'll turn ugly. No one likes to see someone else messing around in their mind."
ariadne,"Cobb can't build anymore, can he?"
arthur,"I don't know if he can't, but he won't. He thinks it's safer if he doesn't know the layouts."
ariadne,Why?
arthur,He won't tell me. I think it's Mal. I think she's getting stronger.
ariadne,His ex-wife?
arthur,She's not his ex.
ariadne,They're still together?
arthur,"No. No, she's dead, Ariadne. What you see in there is just his projection of her."
ariadne,What was she like in real life?
arthur, She was lovely.
saito,"Robert Fischer, 32. Heir to the Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate. He's spent his whole life being groomed as successor-breaking up his father's empire will take a radical shift in his thinking."
cobb,What's your problem with Fischer?
saito,That's not your concern.
cobb,"This isn't the usual corporate espionage, Mr. Saito. This is inception. The seed of the idea we plant will grow in this man's mind. It'll change him. It might even come to define him."
saito,My sources suggest you might not have always been so cautious.
cobb,"Then you need new sources, Mr. Saito."
saito,"Fischer Morrow has the regulators in their pockets. We're the last company standing between them and total energy dominance and we can no longer compete. Soon they'll control the energy supply of half the world. They'll be able to blackmail governments, dictate policy. In effect, they become a new superpower. The world needs Robert Fischer to change his mind."
eames,That's where we come in. How's Robert Fischer's relationship to his father?
saito,Rumor is the relationship is complicated.
cobb,"We'll need more than rumor, Mr. Saito."
eames,Can you get me access to him? Browning. Fischer senior's right- hand man. Fischer junior's godfather.
saito,It should be possible. If you can get the right references.
eames,"References are something of a specialty for me, Mr. Saito."
yusuf,"Come, come."
yusuf,"Ah, yes. Mr. Cobb. I've heard so very much about you.  please."
yusuf,Bloody cats.
yusuf,"You work using Somnacin, I think, Mr. Cobb?"
cobb,"You're well informed, Mr. Yusuf."
cobb, Somnacin?
yusuf, Yusuf's Somnacin.
cobb,As good as the real thing?
yusuf,Better.
yusuf,"Binds the dreamers tight. Let's them dream as one. Makes it real. Of course, if you'd prefer, you could use Somnacin brand. If you could explain to the international control council what you wanted it for."
yusuf,You are seeking a chemist?  To formulate compounds for a job?
cobb,And to come into the held with us.
yusuf,"I rarely go into the held, Mr. Cobb."
cobb,We need you there to tailor compounds to our particular requirements.
yusuf,Which are?
cobb,Great depth.
yusuf,A dream within a dream? Two levels?
cobb,Three.
yusuf,Not possible. That many dreams within dreams would be too unstable.
cobb,I've done it before. You just have to add a sedative.
yusuf,A powerful sedative. How many team members?
cobb,Five.
saito,Six.  The only way to know you've done the job is if I go in with you.
cobb,"There's no room for tourists on these jobs, Mr. Saito."
saito,"This time, it would seem there is."
yusuf,Of course. I use it every day.
cobb,For what?
yusuf,Perhaps... you will not want to see.
eames," Eighteen, twenty-all connected, bloody hell."
yusuf,They come every day. To share the dream.
yusuf,See? Very stable.
cobb,How long do they dream?
yusuf,"Three, four hours. Every day."
cobb,How long in dream time?
yusuf,With this compound... about forty hours. Each and every day.
saito,Why do they do it?
yusuf,"Tell him, Mr. Cobb."
cobb,After a while...  It becomes the only way you can dream.
yusuf,"Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?"
eames,They come here every day to sleep?
cobb,Let's see what you can do.
yusuf,"Sharp, no?"
saito,"Everything alright, Mr. Cobb?"
cobb,Everything's fine.
ariadne,You're back.
ariadne,Are you going under on your own?
cobb,I just-I need to test some things. I didn't realize anyone was here.
ariadne,Just working on my totem.
cobb,Let me see-
cobb,You're learning.
ariadne,It's an elegant solution to keeping track of reality. Your invention?
cobb,No. Mal's.
cobb,This one was hers. She'd spin it in a dream and it would never topple. Just spin and spin...
ariadne,Arthur told me she died.
cobb,She did. How are the mazes coming?
ariadne,"Good. Each level relates to the part of the subject's subconscious we're trying to access. I'm making the bottom level a hospital, so that Fischer will bring his father there-"
cobb,"Don't tell me. Remember, you only want the dreamer to know the layout."
ariadne,Why's that so important?
cobb,In case one of us brings in part of our subconscious. You wouldn't want any projections knowing the layout.
ariadne,In case you bring Mal in.
ariadne,"You won't build yourself because if you know the maze, then she knows it. And she'd sabotage the operation. You can't keep her out, can you?"
ariadne,Do the others know?
cobb,No.
ariadne,You have to warn them if it's getting worse-
cobb," I didn't say it's getting worse. Look, Ariadne, I need them for this job. I need you for this job. Without your help, I'll never get back to my children. And that's all I can care about right now."
ariadne,"Why can't you go home, Cobb?"
cobb,They think I killed her.
ariadne,How did she die?
ariadne,For what?
cobb,Not asking whether I did.
cobb,"The mark is Robert Fischer, heir to the Australian energy conglomerate, Fischer Morrow."
cobb,An idea Robert Fischer's conscious mind would never accept. We have to plant it deep in his subconscious.
arthur,How deep?
cobb,Three levels down.
arthur,A dream within a dream within a dream? Is that even possible?
cobb,Yes. It is.
cobb,"Now, the subconscious motivates through emotion, not reason, so we have to translate the idea into an emotional concept."
arthur,How do you translate a business strategy into an emotion?
cobb,"That's what we have to figure out. Robert and his father have a tense relationship. Worse, even, than the gossip columns have suggested..."
eames,Do you play on that? Suggest breaking up his father's company as a 'screw you' to the old man?
cobb,"No. Positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time. We yearn for people to be reconciled, for catharsis. We need positive emotional logic."
eames,"Try this... ""MY FATHER ACCEPTS THAT I WANT TO CREATE FOR MYSELF, NOT FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS."""
cobb,That might work.
arthur,Might? We'll have to do better than that.
eames,"Thanks for the contribution, Arthur."
arthur,"Forgive me for wanting a little specificity, Eames."
cobb,"Inception's not about specificity. When we get inside his head, we're going to have to work with what we find."
eames,"We could split the idea into emotional triggers, and use one on each level."
cobb,How do you mean?
eames,"On the top level, we open up his relationship with his father.... Say: ""I WILL NOT FOLLOW IN MY FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS."" Next level down we've accessed his ambition and self-esteem. We feed him: ""I WILL CREATE SOMETHING MYSELF."" Then, the bottom level, we bring out the emotional big guns..."
cobb,"""MY FATHER DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE HIM."""
eames,That could do it.
arthur,How do you produce these emotional triggers?
eames,"I forge each emotional concept in the style and manner of Peter Browning, a key figure in Fischer's emotional life."
arthur,Are those yours?
arthur,Yusuf?
yusuf,Yup. Sorry.
cobb,Suppress them. We don't bring our own projections into the dream-we let Fischer's subconscious supply the people.
eames,"Saito, when do I get to see Browning?"
saito,You fly out to Sydney on Tuesday. We've arranged for you to spend several days...
browning,I'm not smelling settlement here-we take them down.
lawyer,"Mr. Browning, Maurice Fischer's policy is always one of avoiding litigation-"
browning,Shall we relay your concerns directly to Maurice?
browning,How is he?
browning,I don't want to bother him unnecessarily but I know he-
father,Robert! I've told you to keep out the damn!-
browning,Must be a cherished memory of his-
fischer,I put it by his bed. He hasn't even noticed.
browning,"Robert, we have to talk about a power of attorney. I know this is hard for you, but it's important that we start to think about the future-"
fischer,"Not now, Uncle Peter."
eames,"Now, in the dream, I can impersonate Browning and suggest the concepts to Fischer's conscious mind...  Then we take Fischer down another level and his own subconscious feeds it right back to him."
arthur, So he gives himself the idea.
eames,Precisely. That's the only way to make it stick. It has to seem self-generated.
arthur,"Eames, I'm impressed."
eames,"Your condescension, as always, is much appreciated, Arthur."
eames,"He's not scheduled for surgery, no dental, nothing."
cobb,I thought he had some knee thing?
eames,"Nothing they'd put him under for. Besides, we need a good ten hours."
saito,Sydney to Los Angeles.
saito,Twelve hours and forty-five minutes-one of the longest flights in the world. He makes it every two weeks...
cobb,Why?
arthur,"On a 747 the pilots are up above, first class is in the nose so nobody walks through the cabin. We'd have to buyout the whole cabin, and the first class flight attendant-"
saito,We bought the airline.
saito,It seemed... neater.
cobb,"Neater, huh?  Nice lobby, by the way."
arthur,My question is how we go down three layers with enough stability. Three layers down a little turbulence is gonna translate into an earthquake. The dreams are gonna collapse with the slightest disturbance.
yusuf,Sedation. For sleep stable enough to create three layers of dreaming...
yusuf,"The compound we'll be using to share the dream is an advanced Somnacin derivative. It creates a very clear connection between dreamers, whilst actually accelerating brain function."
cobb,Buying us more time in each level.
yusuf,Brain function in the dream will be about twenty times normal.  And when you go into a dream within that dream the effect is compounded.
ariadne,How much time?
yusuf,"Three dreams... that's ten hours, times twenty, times twenty, times twenty..."
eames,Math was never my strong suit.
cobb,"It's basically a week one layer down, six months two layers down-"
ariadne,And ten years in the third level. Who wants to spend ten years in a dream?
yusuf,Depends on the dream.
eames,"It's not going to take us long to crack Fischer open once we get going. We'll be out in a couple days, max."
arthur,How do we get out once we've made the plant?  I hope you've got something a little more elegant in mind than shooting me in the head like last time.
cobb,A kick.
ariadne,What's a kick?
eames,"That, Ariadne, would be a kick."
cobb,That feeling of falling which snaps you awake. We use that to jolt ourselves awake once we're done.
arthur,But how are we going to feel that through the sedation?
yusuf,That's the clever part. I customize the sedative...
yusuf,"That way, however deep the sleep, the sleeper will still feel falling..."
arthur,Even that won't cut through three layers of deep sleep.
cobb,"The trick is to devise a kick for each level, then synchronize them to get a snap that penetrates all three layers."
arthur,We can use the musical countdown to synchronize the different kicks.
mal,You remember when you asked me to marry you?
cobb,Of course...
mal,You said you had a dream...
cobb,That we'd grow old together.
mal,And we can. You know how to find me... you know what you have to do.
cobb,You shouldn't be in here.
ariadne,"I wanted to know what ""tests"" you need to do on your own every night."
ariadne,Why do you do this to yourself?
cobb,This is the only way I can still dream.
ariadne,Is it so important to dream?
cobb,In my dreams... we're still together.
ariadne,"But these aren't just dreams, are they? They're memories. You said never to use memories."
cobb,And I shouldn't.
ariadne,You're keeping her alive.
cobb,No.
ariadne,You can't let her go.
cobb,No. These are moments I regret. Moments I turned into dreams so I could change them.
ariadne,What've you got buried down there that you regret?
cobb,There's only one thing I need you to understand about me...
ariadne,This is your house?
cobb,Mine and Mal's.
ariadne,Where is she?
cobb,She'd already died.
cobb,It's James. My boy. He's found something. Maybe a worm.
cobb,And there's Philippa.
cobb,"I thought about calling out, so they'd turn and smile those incredible smiles... but I'm out of time-"
thin man,"Right now. Or never, Cobb."
cobb,"Then I panic that I'll always wish I'd seen them turn, that I can't waste this chance..."
cobb,"But the moment's passed. And whatever I do, the dream's always the same... When I'm about to call... they run."
cobb,If I'm going to see their faces again-I've got to get back here in the real world...
ariadne,My name is-
mal,I know who you are. What are you doing here?
ariadne,I don't know. Trying to understand.
mal,How could you understand? Do you know what it is to be a lover? To be half of a whole?
ariadne,No.
mal,"I'll tell you a riddle. You're waiting for a train. A train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you, but you don't know for sure..."
mal,But... it doesn't matter. How can it not matter to you where that train will take you?
mal,"How could you bring her here, Dom?"
ariadne,What is this place?
cobb,A hotel. We spent our anniversaries in this suite.
ariadne,What happened here?
mal,you PROMISED! YOU SAID WE'D BE TOGETHER!-
cobb,We can. We will. But I need you to stay here for now-
mal,YOU SAID WE'D GROW OLD TOGETHER!-
cobb,I'll come back. I need you to stay here on your own for now. Just while I do this job. Then we can be together-
mal,WE'LL BE TOGETHER-YOU PROMISED!-
ariadne,You think you can just build a prison of memories to lock her in? You think that's going to contain her?
saito,Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.
cobb,When's the funeral?
saito,Thursday. In Los Angeles.
cobb,Robert'll accompany the body Tuesday at the outside. We have to move.
ariadne, I'm coming with you.
cobb,No. I promised Miles.
ariadne,The team needs someone in there who understands what you're struggling with. If you don't want it to be me then you need to show Arthur what I just saw.
cobb,We need one more seat on the plane.
cobb,If I get on this plane and you haven't taken care of things... when we land I go to jail for the rest of my life.
saito,"Complete the job en route, I make one phone call from the plane... you will have no trouble clearing immigration."
eames,"Oh, sorry."
cobb,Excuse me?
fischer,Yes?
cobb,I think this is yours...
flight attendant,Would you gentlemen care for a drink?
fischer,Water.
cobb,Same.
fischer,"Well, thank you."
cobb,"No problem. Look, I couldn't help noticing your name. You're not related to Maurice Fischer?"
fischer,"Actually, he was my father."
cobb,I'm very sorry for your loss. He was an inspiring figure.
cobb,Thanks.
cobb,To Maurice Fischer.  I'll leave you in peace.
arthur, Couldn't you have peed before you went under?
yusuf,Sorry.
eames,"Bit too much free champagne before takeoff, Yusuf?"
yusuf,Ha bloody ha.
cobb,At least we know he'll be looking for a cab in this.
cobb,Brace yourselves.
cabdriver,"Hey, asshole! Why don't you try driving without your thumb up-"
cobb,Walk away.
fischer,Third and Market. Snappy.
fischer,What're you doing?
eames,"Sorry, I thought it was free. Maybe we could share."
fischer,Maybe not.
fischer,Great.
fischer, There's 500 dollars in there. And the wallet's worth more than that. For that you ought to at least drop me at my stop.
eames,I'm afraid-
eames,Get us out of here!
cobb,Come on!-
ariadne,This wasn't in the design-
arthur,Everybody okay? Saito?
cobb,Arthur! Arthur what the-
cobb,"Oh, Christ. Is he dying?"
arthur,I don't know. What happened back there? Where were you?
cobb,We were blocked by a freight train.
arthur, Why would you put a train crossing in a downtown intersection?
ariadne,I didn't.
cobb," Why were we all ambushed, Arthur?! Those weren't regular projections- they'd been trained!"
ariadne,How could they be trained?
arthur,Fischer's had an extractor teach his mind to defend itself. His subconscious is militarized. It should've shown on the research-
cobb,So why the hell didn't it?!
arthur,Calm down.
cobb,Don't tell me to calm down-you were meant to check Fischer's background thoroughly. You can't make this kind of mistake-we're not prepared for this kind of violence-
arthur,"Cobb, we've dealt with sub-security before. We just have to be more-"
cobb,"This wasn't part of the plan, Arthur!  He's dying!"
eames,So we put him out of his misery.
cobb,No.
eames,He's in agony. Let's wake him up-
cobb,No!  It won't wake him up.
eames,"What do you mean, it won't wake him? When you die in a dream you wake up."
yusuf,Not from this. We're too heavily sedated to wake up that way.
eames,So what happens if one of us dies?
cobb,That person doesn't wake up. Their mind drops into Limbo.
ariadne,Limbo?
arthur,Unconstructed dream space.
ariadne,What's down there?
arthur,"Raw, infinite subconscious. Nothing there but what was left behind by anyone on the team who's been trapped there before. On this team... just Cobb."
ariadne,How long would we be stuck there?
yusuf,You couldn't even think about trying to escape until the sedation eases-
eames,How long?
yusuf,Decades-it could be infinite-I don't know! Ask him-he's the one who's been there before!
eames,"Great. So now we're stuck in Fischer's mind battling it out with his private army, and if we get hit we're stuck in Limbo 'til our brains dissolve into scrambled egg?"
arthur,Let's just get him upstairs.
arthur,Hold this. Firm pressure.
arthur,You knew the risks and you didn't tell us.
cobb,There wasn't meant to be any risk. We weren't supposed to be dealing with a load of gunnre.
arthur,You had no right.
cobb,"It's the only way you can go three layers deep, Arthur."
arthur,And you. You went along with this?
yusuf,I trusted him.
arthur,You trusted him? When? When he promised you half his share?
yusuf," No! His whole share. Plus, he told me he'd done it before."
arthur,"Oh, yeah? With Mal? That worked out great, didn't it, Cobb?"
cobb,"You don't know anything about that. This was the only way to do this job, Arthur. I did what I had to do to get back to my children."
eames,So you led us into a war zone with no way out.
cobb,"We have a way out. The kick. We just have to push on, do the job as fast as possible and get out using the kick."
eames,"Forget it. We go any deeper, we just raise the stakes. I'm sitting it out on this level."
cobb,"You'll never make it, Eames. Fischer's security is surrounding this place as we speak. The ten hours of the flight is a week at this level-you'll never make it without getting killed. Downwards is the only way forwards. We have to carry on."
cobb,And we have to do it fast.
cobb,"Eames, go get ready. Arthur, let's get in there and soften him up."
fischer,I'm insured against kidnapping up to ten million-this'll be simple-
cobb,"No, it won't."
arthur,"In. your lather's office, below the bookshelves, is his personal safe. We need the combination."
fischer,I never noticed a safe-
cobb,Doesn't mean you don't know the combination.
fischer,"Well, I don't."
arthur,We have it on good authority that you do.
fischer,Whose?
yusuf,"Five hundred dollars, this cost?"
eames,What's inside?
yusuf,"Cash, cards, ID... and this-"
eames,Useful?
cobb,You're on. You've got an hour.
eames,An hour? I was supposed to have all night to crack him.
cobb,And Saito was supposed to keep his guts on the inside. You've got an hour-get something we can use.
fischer,What's that?
arthur,Good authority.
fischer,Uncle Peter?! Make them stop-
arthur,The combination.
fischer,I don't know it!
arthur,Why would Browning tell us you did?
fischer,Let me talk to him-I'll find out.
cobb,You've got an hour. Get talking.
fischer,"Neither do I, Uncle Peter."
browning, Maurice told me that after he passed only you would be able to open it.
fischer,He never gave me the combination.
browning,"He did, he just didn't tell you that it was a combination."
fischer,"What, then?"
browning,Something only you would know. Some meaningful combination of numbers from your experiences with Maurice-
fischer,We didn't have a lot of meaningful experiences together.
browning,Perhaps after your mother died...
fischer,"After my mother died, I went to him in my grief.  You know what he told me? ""There's really nothing to be said, Robert."""
browning,He always had a hard time with emotional-
fischer,"I was eleven, Uncle Peter."
browning,"He loved you, Robert. In his way."
fischer,"""In his way?"" At the end he called me to his deathbed. He could barely speak, but he took the trouble to say one last thing to me. He pulled me close... I could make out only one word. ""Disappointed."""
cobb,How's he doing?
ariadne,He's in a lot of pain.
cobb,"When we get you down to the next level, the pain will be less intense."
ariadne, And if he dies?
cobb,His conscious mind will drop out of the dream. He'll be trapped in Limbo for a lifetime...
ariadne,What will that do to him?
cobb,When he wakes... his mind could be completely gone.
saito,When... when we wake I will still honor our arrangement...
cobb,"Saito-san, when you wake you might not even remember that we had an arrangement. You'll have forgotten this world. Limbo will be your reality. Lost there so long, you'll have become an old man..."
saito,Filled with regret?
cobb,Waiting to die alone. Yes.
saito,Then I'll take the chance and come back. And we'll be young men together again.
ariadne,When were you trapped in Limbo?
ariadne,"Cobb, you might have convinced the rest of this team to carry on with the job. But they don't know the truth."
cobb,What truth?
ariadne,"The truth that at any minute you might bring a freight train through the wall. The truth that Mal is bursting up through your subconscious.  The truth that as we go deeper into Fischer, we're also going deeper into you-and I'm not sure we're going to like what we find there."
ariadne,"This is not just about Fischer, it's about you. Tell me what happened to you and Mal. Trapped in Limbo."
cobb,We were on a job. Exploring dreams within dreams. But we didn't understand how your mind can turn hours into years. How you can get trapped. Trapped so deep that when you wash up on the shore of your subconscious...
cobb,You can lose track of what's real.
ariadne,How long were you stuck?
cobb,Fifty years.
ariadne,How did you stand it?
cobb,We built. We created a whole world for ourselves...
ariadne,But not for her?
cobb,She accepted it. At some point...
ariadne,And when you finally woke up?
cobb,To wake from that. From decades lived. To be old souls thrown back into youth. It was hard. At first Mal seemed okay. But I started to realize something was wrong. Finally she admitted it. This idea she was possessed by. This simple little idea that changed everything...
ariadne,What was it?
cobb,"That our world was not real. No matter what I did, no matter what I said, she was convinced that we were still in a dream. That we needed to wake up again..."
ariadne,What about your children?
cobb,She... she believed they weren't real. That our real children were waiting. Somewhere above...
cobb,"Calm down, Mal-"
mal,"They're projections, Dom. Your dreams. I'm their mother-don't you think I can tell the difference?"
cobb,If it's my dream then why can't I control it? Why can't I stop this?
mal, You don't know you're dreaming.
cobb,You keep telling me I am-
mal,And you don't believe me!
mal,Join me.
cobb,"Mal, come back inside."
mal,No. I'm going to jump. And you're coming with me.
cobb,"No, I'm not. This is real-if you jump, you're not going to wake up, you're going to die. Let's go back inside and talk about this, please."
mal,We've talked enough.
mal,Come out onto the ledge or I'll jump right now.
mal,I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.
cobb,"I can't do that, Mal. I can't leave our children."
mal,"If I go without you, they'll take them away, anyway."
cobb,What do you mean?
mal,"I filed a letter with our attorney. Explaining how I'm fearful for my safety, how you've threatened to kill me..."
cobb,"Out children are here, Mal."
mal,You're waiting for a train...
cobb,"NO! MAL, NO, I CAN'T!"
mal,A train that will take you far away...
cobb,DON'T DO THIS!
mal,"You know where you hope this train will take you, you can't know for sure..."
cobb,DON'T!
mal,But it doesn't matter...
cobb,NO!
mal,Because you'll be together...
cobb,He letter to the authorities refuted all the claims about her sanity that she knew I'd make...
thin man,"Right now. Or never, Cobb."
ariadne,Psychiatrists judged her sane?
cobb,She was sane. She was just lost in the labyrinth.
ariadne,Then why should you blame yourself?
cobb,Because we were a family. And we had a life I would do anything to get back to now. But that reality wasn't enough for me then.
ariadne,"It might have been your idea to push the limits, Cobb. But you're not responsible for the idea that destroyed her. The idea that her world wasn't real... that was her own idea from her own mind."
cobb,You don't have to do this for me-
ariadne,I'm doing it for the others. They don't know the risk they've taken coming in here with you.
cobb,We can't stay here. Arthur?!
browning,These people are going to kill us if we don't give them the combination.
fischer,"They won't, they'll try to ransom us-"
browning,I heard them-they're going to lock us in and run the can into the river.
fischer,What is in the safe?
browning,Something for you. Maurice always said it was his most previous gift... a will.
fischer,Maurice's will is with Port and Dunn.
browning,It's an alternate. It supersedes the other only if you want it to.
fischer,What does it say?
browning,"It splits all the component businesses of Fischer Morrow into individual companies, transferring ownership to the boards of those companies..."
fischer,Leaving me nothing?
browning,A basic living. Nothing more. The entire empire would cease to exist.
fischer,Destroy my own inheritance? Why would he suggest such a thing?
browning,"I don't know, Robert."
cobb,Come to your senses?
fischer,Let us go. I don't know the combination. Not consciously.
cobb,Let's try instinctively. I have someone standing in your father's office ready to tap in a combination.
fischer,I have no idea-
cobb,RIGHT NOW!
fischer,"Five, two, eight... four, nine, one."
cobb,You'll have to do better. Bag `em.
fischer,We're worth much more to you alive...
eames, His relationship with his father's much worse that we thought.
arthur,That helps us?
cobb,"The stronger the issues, the more powerful the catharsis."
arthur,But how do you reconcile them if they're that estranged?
eames,I'm working on that.
arthur,"Well, work fast-Fischer's projections are closing in quick, we need to break out of here before we're totally boxed in..."
eames,"Shouldn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, Arthur-"
cobb,Shifting Fischer's antipathy from his father onto Browning should work.
eames,"We need the imagery, the words..."
ariadne,So you destroy his one positive relationship?
cobb,No. We repair his relationship with his father and expose his godfather's true nature.
eames,"Hell, we should be charging Fischer as much as Saito."
arthur,What about his security? It's going to get worse as we go deeper.
cobb,We bring in Mr. Charles.
arthur,No.
eames,Who's Mr. Charles?
arthur,A bad idea.
cobb,"Arthur, the second we approach Fischer in that hotel, they're gonna mow us down-we run with Mr. Charles like on the Stein job."
eames,So you've done it before?
arthur,Sure. But it didn't work. The subject realized he was dreaming and his subconscious tore us to pieces.
eames,"You learned a lot, though. Right?"
cobb, I'll need a decoy.
eames,No problem. How about a pretty young lady I've used before?
cobb,Fine-
arthur,"And don't make the jump too soon- that kick is our only way back, we have to be ready to catch it-"
yusuf,"I'll use the music to let you know when it's coming, but the rest is up to you."
fischer,I have a lot on my mind.
arthur,And there goes Mr. Charles.
ariadne,"Who or what, exactly, is Mr. Charles?"
arthur,It's a gambit designed to turn Fischer against his own subconscious.
cobb,"Mr. Fishcer! Good to see you again. Rod Green, Marketing.  And you must be..."
blonde,Leaving.
cobb,I think you just got blown off... unless her phone number really does have only six digits.
ariadne,And why don't you approve?
arthur,Because it involves telling the mark that he's dreaming. Which involves attracting a lot of attention to us.
ariadne,Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
arthur,You must've noticed by now how much time Cobb spends doing things he says never to do.
cobb,"Strange way to make friends.  Lifting your wallet, I mean."
fischer,Goddamn it. The wallet alone's worth-
cobb,"Five hundred bucks. I know. Don't worry, my guys are on it."
fischer,Who did you say you were?
cobb,I said I was Rod Green from Marketing-but I'm not. My name is Mr. Charles. I might seem familiar to you. I'm in charge of your security here.
blonde,"Mr. Saito, can I have a minute?"
saito,"I'm sorry, but..."
eames,You look a bit perkier.
saito,Turbulence on the plane.
eames,Feels closer. That's Yusuf's driving.
fischer,Security? You work for the hotel?
cobb,No. My specialty is subconscious security.
fischer,You're talking about dreams. You're talking about extraction.
cobb,Exactly. My job is to protect you...
eames,"Get off at a different floor and keep moving. Dump the wallet, then meet me in the lobby. The security will try to track it down. We need to buy Cobb a little more time."
cobb,You're not safe here.
cobb,"Strange weather, huh?"
ariadne,What's happening?
arthur,Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention to the strangeness of the dream. That's making his subconscious look for the dreamer. For me.
cobb,"Very odd-the weather, the gravity..."
fischer,So you... you're not real?
cobb,No. I'm a projection of your subconscious. I was put in place to protect you in the event that extractors pulled you into a dream. I believe that's what has happened.
fischer,Hey-
cobb,Look at the gun in his hand.
fischer,"If this is a dream, I have to kill myself and wake up-"
cobb,"I wouldn't do that-they've probably got you sedated. If you pull that trigger, you might not wake up, you might drop into a lower dream state.  Mr. Fischer, you know all this, you just have to remember it..."
arthur,"So, if everything's correct, this"
cobb,What do you remember from before this dream?
fischer, Christ-we've been kidnapped.
cobb,Where were they holding you?
fischer,They had us... in the back of a van...
cobb,Your body's bouncing around in the back of a van right now-that explains the gravity shifts.
fischer,"It was... to do with a safe... Christ, why's it so hard to remember?"
cobb,"It's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up. It takes years of practice to do it easily. So, you and Browning have been pulled into this dream so they can steal something from your mind. What?"
fischer,They wanted a combination to a safe... they demanded the first numbers to pop into my head.
cobb,That's them extracting a locator.
fischer,A locator?
cobb,A number from your own subconscious. It can be used any number of ways...  This is a hotel. Room numbers. What was the number you gave them?
fischer,"5, 2... something... it was a long"
cobb, Fifth floor.
ariadne,Do you use a timer?
arthur,"No, I have to judge it myself. Once you're all asleep up in room 528, I wait `til Yusuf starts his kick..."
ariadne,How will you know?
arthur,"His music warns me it's coming, then the van hitting the barrier of the bridge should be unmistakable- that's when I blow the floor out from underneath us and we get a nice synchronized kick. Too soon, and we won't get pulled out; too late and I won't be able to drop us."
ariadne,Why not?
arthur,The van will be in free fall. I can't drop us with no gravity.
saito,I see you've changed.
browning,I'm sorry?
saito,I'm... I mistook you for a friend.
browning,"Good-looking fellow, I'm sure."
eames,That's Fischer's projection of Browning. We'll keep an eye on how he behaves-
saito,Why?
eames,How he acts will tell us if Fischer's starting to suspect his motives the way we want him to.
cobb,They work for me.
arthur,Mr. Charles!
cobb,You know what this is?
fischer,I think so. But I don't understand.
cobb,They were going to put you under.
fischer,I'm already under.
cobb,Under again.
fischer,A dream within a dream?
arthur,Shhhh!
fischer,Uncle Peter. What's going on?
cobb,You said you were kidnapped together?
fischer,"Not exactly, they already had him. They'd been torturing him..."
cobb,You saw them torture him?
fischer,The kidnappers are working for you.
browning,"No, Robert-"
fischer,You're trying to get that safe open. To get the alternate will.
browning,Fischer Morrow's been my entire life. I can't let you destroy it.
fischer,I'm not going to throw away my inheritance. Why would I?
browning,I couldn't take the chance of you rising to your father's final taunt.
fischer,What taunt?
browning,"That will. I'm sorry, Robert, but it's his final insult. A challenge to build something for yourself. He's telling you that you aren't worthy of his achievements."
fischer,"That he was ""disappointed?"""
browning,I'm so sorry. But he was wrong. You'll make his company even greater than he ever could.
cobb,"Your godfather's lying, Robert."
fischer,How do you know?
cobb,It's what I do. He's hiding something.
cobb,Let's find out what.
cobb,Let's do to him what he was going to do to you.
cobb,We'll penetrate his subconscious and find out what he doesn't want you to know.
arthur,He's out.
ariadne,"Wait, Cobb-I'm lost. Whose subconscious are we going into?"
cobb,Fischer's. I told him it was Browning's so he'd come with us as part of our team.
arthur, He's going to help us break into his own subconscious.
cobb,That's the idea. He'll think that his security is Browning's and fight them to learn the truth about his father.
cobb,Fischer's subconscious is going to run you down hard.
arthur,I'll lead them on a merry chase.
cobb,Be back in time for the kick.
arthur,I'm on it.
ariadne,What's down there?
cobb,"Hopefully, the truth we want Fischer to learn."
ariadne,I meant what's down there for you?
cobb,You're the dreamer. I need you to draw the security away from the complex.
eames,Then who guides Fischer in? You?
cobb,If I know the route... we could be compromised.
ariadne,I designed the place.
cobb,No. You're with me.
cobb,"Eames, brief Saito on the route into the complex. What we're looking for is going to be in the most heavily fortified section. That north tower."
cobb,"Mr. Fischer, you're going in with Mr. Saito."
fischer,You're not coming in?
cobb,"You have to do this on your own. You have to get in there, break into your godfather's mind and find out the truth about your father."
cobb,"Keep this live at all times. I'll be listening in, covering you.  The windows on the upper floors are big enough that I can cover you from that south tower."
yusuf,Bugger.
arthur,Hey!
yusuf,Sod it. I hope your ready.
arthur,"No, Yusuf. Too soon!"
eames,I noticed it twenty minutes ago-at first I thought it was just wind...
cobb,"No, it's music. Dammit."
cobb,"We move fast. Saito, did you copy?"
saito,We're going as fast as we can.
ariadne,How long do we have?
cobb,"Yusuf's about ten seconds from the jump, which gives Arthur about three minutes, which gives us about-"
ariadne,Sixty minutes.
cobb,"The route you gave them, can they do it in under an hour?"
ariadne,I don't think so. They've still got to climb down to the middle terrace.
cobb,They need a new route-a direct route.
ariadne,The building's designed as a labyrinth.
cobb,There must be access routes that cut through the maze.  Eames?
cobb,Did Eames add any features?
ariadne,Yes.
cobb,What did he add?
ariadne,I shouldn't tell you. If Mal-
cobb,There's no time-what did he add?
ariadne,"Utility closets, trap doors..."
cobb,What about service features? Did he add any large pipes or-
ariadne,Ducts. He added an air duct system- it doesn't follow the maze. They can use it to go straight from the outer walls to the upper tower.
cobb,Explain it to them.
ariadne, Saito?
saito,Go ahead.
arthur,Paradox.
saito,Look out!
ariadne,What was that?
cobb,The kick.
cobb,"Yeah, we missed it."
eames,What the hell do we do now?
eames,What next kick?
cobb,When the van hits the water. I figure Arthur's got a couple minutes and we've got about twenty.
arthur,How the hell do I drop you?
ariadne, That's the antechamber outside the strongroom.
cobb,What about the strongroom? Doesn't it have any windows?
ariadne,"Wouldn't be very strong if it did.  Look, if you wanted to design it yourself-"
cobb,It's fine. Better hope that we like what Fischer finds in there.
ariadne,"These projections, they're part of his subconscious?"
cobb,Yeah.
ariadne,Are you destroying those parts of his mind?
cobb,"No, of course not. They're just projections."
eames,They're heading your way. Like they know something.
cobb,Buy us some time.
fischer, We're here. Are we clear to proceed?
cobb,"You're clear, but hurry-there's an army headed your way..."
cobb,Shit. There's someone else in there.
ariadne,"Fischer, stop! It's a trap!-"
cobb,Come on... a little lower... a little-
ariadne,"Cobb, that's not really her-"
cobb,How can you know that?
fischer,I'm in.
mal,Hello.
ariadne,"Cobb, she's just a projection. Fischer... he's real."
ariadne,Eames? Get to the anteroom now!
eames,What happened?
ariadne,Mal killed Fischer-
cobb,I wouldn't shoot her.
cobb,It won't do any good-
cobb,"Even if you could revive his body, his mind's trapped down there. It's over."
eames,"So that it, then? We failed."
cobb,I'm sorry.
eames,It's you who doesn't get back to your family.
eames,I wanted to know what was going to happen in there. I think we had this one.
ariadne,There's still a way: We follow Fischer down-
eames,We're almost out of time-
ariadne,"Down there they'll be enough time. We'll find him-soon as you hear Arthur's music start, you use the defibrillator to revive him-we give him his own early kick from below.  Then, as the music ends you blow the hospital and we all ride the kick back up through the layers."
eames,"Okay, Saito can hold them off while I plant the rest of the charges."
cobb,"Saito's not going to last, Eames."
ariadne,We have to try!
eames,"Go for it, but I'm taking the kick whether you're back or not..."
ariadne,Can I trust you to do what's needed? Mal's down there-
cobb,And I can find her. She'll have Fischer.
ariadne,How do you know?
cobb,She wants me to come after him. She wants me back down there with her.
ariadne,This is your world?
cobb,It was. And this is where she'll be.
eames,"Come on, Saito. I need you to cover Fischer while I plant the charges."
ariadne,You built all this?
cobb,We both did.
ariadne,It's incredible.
cobb,"We built for years. Then, when that got stale, we started in on the memories."
cobb,This is our neighborhood.
ariadne, From what city?
cobb,No. Our neighborhood.  That was our first apartment... then we moved to that building... we got that small house when Mal became pregnant.
ariadne,You reconstructed them all from memory?
cobb,We had time.
ariadne,What's that?
cobb,The house Mal grew up in.
ariadne,Will she be in there?
cobb,No. Come on-
cobb,"We both wanted a house, but we both loved skyscrapers. In the real world we had to choose. Not here."
ariadne,How do we send Fischer back?
cobb,We need some kind of kick.
ariadne,What?
cobb,I'll improvise.
cobb,"There's something you have to understand about me. About inception. You see, an idea is like a virus..."
cobb,"Resilient...  Highly contagious, and an idea can grow. The smallest seed of an idea can grow to define or destroy your world..."
mal,"The smallest idea, such as... ""Your world is not real."""
mal,A simple little thought that changes everything...
mal,So certain of your world. Of what's real. Do you think he is-  Or do you think he's as lost as I was?
cobb,I know what's real.
mal,"What are the distinguishing characteristics of a dream? Mutable laws of physics? Tell that to the quantum physicists. Reappearance of the dead? What about heaven and hell? Persecution of the dreamer, the creator, the messiah? They crucified Christ, didn't they?"
cobb,I know what's real.
mal,"No creeping doubts? Not feeling persecuted, Dom? Chased around the globe by anonymous corporations and police forces? The way the projections persecute the dreamer?"
mal,"Admit it, Dom. You don't believe in one reality anymore. So choose. Choose your reality like I did. Choose to be here. Choose me."
cobb," I have chosen, Mal. Our children. I have to get back to them. Because you left them. You left us."
mal,"You're wrong, Dom. You're confused... our children are here-"
mal," And you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you, Dom?"
cobb,Our real children are waiting for me up above.
mal, Up above? Listen to yourself. You judged me for believing the very same thing.
mal,"These are our children. Watch.  Hey, James! Philippa?!"
cobb,"They're not real, Mal. Our real children are waiting for us-"
mal,You keep telling yourself that but you don't believe it-
cobb,I know it-
mal,And what if you're wrong? What if I'm what's real?
mal,You keep telling yourself what you know... but what do you believe? What do you feel?
cobb,Guilt. I feel guilt. And however confused I might get.  However lost I might seem... it's always there. Telling me something. Reminding me of the truth.
mal,What truth?
cobb,That you were wrong to doubt our world. That the idea that drove you to question your reality was a lie...
mal,How could you know it was a lie?
cobb,Because it was my lie.
mal, Because you planted the idea in my mind.
cobb,"Because I performed inception on my own wife, then reaped the bitter rewards..."
ariadne,Why?
cobb,"We'd become lost in here. Living in a world of infinite possibilities. A world where we were gods. I realized we needed to escape, but she'd locked away her knowledge of the unreality of this world..."
cobb,I couldn't make Mal understand that we needed to break free. To die. So I started to search our world...
cobb,Searching for the right place in her mind...
cobb,"And when I found that place, that secret place where she had shut away her knowledge years before, I broke it open..."
cobb,"I broke into the deepest recess of her mind, to give her the simplest little idea."
cobb,"A truth that she had once known, but had chosen to forget..."
cobb,That her world was not real.
cobb,"You're waiting for a train. A train that will take you far away. You know where you hope this train will take you, but you can't know for sure. Yet it doesn't matter..."
mal,Because you'll be together.
cobb,I never thought that the idea I'd planted would grow in her mind like a cancer. That even after we woke...
mal,That death was the only escape?
mal,You killed me.
cobb,I was trying to save you-I'm sorry.
mal,You infected my mind. You betrayed me. But you can make amends. You can still keep your promise. We can still be together... right here. In our world. The world we built together.
ariadne,We need Fischer.
mal,You can't have him.
cobb,"If I stay, can she take him back?"
ariadne,"Cobb, what are you saying?"
mal,Fischer's on the porch.
ariadne,"Cobb, you can't do this."
cobb,"Go check he's alive, Ariadne."
ariadne,He's here. And it's time. But you have to come with us.
ariadne,"Cobb, I'm not going to let you lose yourself in here! You have to get back to your children!"
cobb,"Send Fischer, I have to stay-"
ariadne,You can't stay here to be with her-
cobb,I'm not. Saito is dead by now. That means he's here. I have to stay here and find him.
cobb,I can't stay here to be with her because she's not real.
mal,"Not real? I'm the only thing you do believe in anymore. Here-doesn't this feel real, Dom?"
cobb,I wish you were. But I couldn't make you real. I'm not capable of imagining you in all your complexity and... perfection. As you really were. You're the best I can do. And you're not real.
ariadne,No!
cobb,What're you doing?
ariadne,Improvising.
eames,Get in there-quick!
cobb,No!
father, I... was ... dis ... dis ...
fischer,"I know, Dad. You were disappointed that I couldn't be you."
father, I was disappointed... that you tried.
eames," Come on, come on..."
cobb,That's the kick-you have to go!
ariadne,You're coming!
cobb,"No, I'm not. I'm staying here to find Saito.  And to say goodbye."
ariadne,Don't lose yourself. Find Saito. And bring him back.
cobb,I will.
mal,We'd be together forever. You promised me.
cobb,I know. But we can't. And I'm sorry.
mal,You remember when you asked me to marry you? You said you dreamt that we'd grow old together.
cobb,And we did...
cobb,I miss you more than I can bear... but we had our time together. And now I have to let go...
browning,"I'm sorry, Robert."
fischer,"The will means that Dad wanted me to be my own man, not live for him.  And I'm going to, Uncle Peter."
arthur,What happened?
ariadne,Cobb stayed.
arthur,With Mal?
ariadne,No. To find Saito.
arthur,He'll be lost...
ariadne,No. He'll be alright.
saito,So... have you come to kill me?
saito,I've been waiting for someone to come for me...
cobb,Someone from your half-remembered dream...?
saito,Cobb? Not possible-he and I were young men together. And I am an old man...
cobb,Filled with regret?
saito,"Waiting to die alone, yes."
cobb,I came back for you... I came to remind you of what you once knew...
cobb,That this world is not real.
saito,You came to convince me to honor our arrangement?
cobb,Yes. And to take a leap of faith.
cobb,Come back and we'll be young men together again.
flight attendant,We'll be landing in Los Angeles in about twenty minutes. Do you need immigration forms?
