1.," A line at a time, the following quote appears over a black screen."
fade in:," 1987  1   EXT HARLEM STREET  DAY                                          1  A COLD WIND blows a bright red scarf tangled high on a street lamp.  An iron waste bin is blown sideways into an intersection. A stray dog investigates it briefly, urinates and then moves on.  A book bag drops onto the pavement.  Visible from the waist down, a LARGE YOUNG WOMAN in a disintegrating leather jacket turns the waste bin upright and then maneuvers it onto the sidewalk.  Once finished, her thick hands wipe each other until they stop abruptly.  Here, for the first time, we see her PLUMP, YOUTHFUL, VACANT AFRICAN AMERICAN FACE. It is 16-YEAR-OLD PRECIOUS JONES. Something inside the bin has caught her attention.  Precious gazes down upon a soiled and tattered paperback book as the breath from her nostrils steams. The title of the book staring back up at her is unintelligible.  She pushes debris aside to get to it.  The book plunges deeper into the trash, as if trying to flee.  The sound of an ONCOMING CAR approaches.  Precious pins the book against the bottom of the bin as the sounds of the oncoming car close in.  Precious finally comes up with the book. Its title is still unintelligible. When she flips it over, however, the letters on the cover, which are facing us now, make sense. They read CRYSTAL STAIR: SELECTED WORKS BY LANGSTON HUGHES."
2.,1   CONTINUED:                                                    1 The car sounds incredibly close.

Noise and projectiles fill the air.  MR. WICHER -A FRAIL MAN IN A BOW TIE AND TWEED COAT, stands at the head of the class trying to establish order.  MR. WICHER Class, would you please turn to page 122 ...Class! 122!  Precious' book stays closed as the other students find the page.  TWO BOYS in front of Precious giggle boisterously at some private joke.  Mr. Wicher looks annoyed but accustomed to this.  PRECIOUS  Everyday I tell myself something gonna happen, like I'm gonna break through or somebody gonna break through to me -I'm gonna learn, catch up, be normal, sit in the front ...someday.  The giggling flares up again. Precious sneers at the boys.  MR. WICHER Today we are going to review Monday's assignment. Would anyone like to begin?  The boys get louder."

The New Yorkers surrounding her are all men of various backgrounds. All wear the exact same suits and raincoats.  Precious looks up to find two of the businessmen staring down at her.  We pan from them and around the bus to find all of the other passengers studying Precious in silence as well.  PRECIOUS  If other peoples could see that the way I do, they would see that I am a real person inside.  Our long circular pan finally lands on Precious' seat but sitting there now is the pretty blond white girl from Precious' bedroom mirror wearing Precious' clothes.  The bus grinds to a stop.  A man smiles at Precious and steps off the bus.  The original Precious takes the abandoned newspaper from his empty seat and tries to read it."
