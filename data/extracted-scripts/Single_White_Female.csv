Speaker,Dialogue
allison,And I want them to look like you.
sam,Poor kids.
sam,"So, if I got to be able to drag you away from computer tomorrow, I'll buy you that ring."
allison,"Sure. So, is this gonna be a real wedding ?"
allison,"You know what I mean, Sam. You've already been through the big ceremony with too hundred people."
sam,That was the fake one. This is the real one. You can have any kind of wedding you want. Underwater. In and out of a steam room in the wild. Horseback.
allison,Naked skydiving ?
sam,Naked skydiving !
allison,"It's OK. It's going to have to be a small one, you know. I've not been in New York long enough to know very many people."
sam,Except me.
allison,"Oh, you're invited."
allison,And my friend Graham upstairs.
sam,"It won't be long before you know half the people in New York. People like you, you know... but I found you first."
allison,You're the only friend I need. You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
allison,Hello ?... Hold on a second.
allison,"Sam, it's your ex-wife. She gives the receiver to Sam. Still half-asleep, Sam takes the phone."
sam,What ?
allison,It's Lisa.
sam,Yeah ?... No... Because... I'm hanging up now.
sam,I'm sorry. She shouldn't call here.
allison,It's where you live. She's entitled.
sam,Don't... don't answer it.
sam,Why does she do this ?
allison,Talk to her now. You're already up. I'll get that. We hear the beep at the end of Allison's message.
sam,Huh-huh...
graham,It's 4 a.m. !
graham,Allie ?
allison,I'm sorry... Sam left. I told him to. And... And I can't be alone tonight... so I came up here.
allison,Thanks.
graham,"Allie, I let you sleep."
allison,What time is it ?
graham,About ten.
allison,"Oh, my God"
allison,I've got a meeting. It's really important.
allison,Hi !
mitchell,Hi !
allison,"I'm sorry, I'm a little late. They shake hands."
mitchell,"No, no, it's worth the wait."
allison,Thank you.
allison,So...
allison,"You can redefine your product on-screen without going to an expensive designing concept. This is Allison Jones' software, and it's a marketing tool no one else has."
mitchell,Who do I get to run it ?
allison,I stay to be the person to speak. That's included in the quote.
mitchell,Ah !... The quote... That's the one thing I haven't seen.
allison,Best for last.
mitchell,Here's where I was thinking of playing.
mitchell,"It makes sense for you. You see, after our last meeting, I made some phone calls... to your former partner, for one."
allison,"No, I wouldn't rely much on what she says. It was not a friendly split. And I did all the work. And... she took all the credit and she didn't like me telling her so."
mitchell,"Well, I was more interested in the settlement you made. You walked off with the hardware and a rent-controlled apartment. Which means your overhead is minimal, as is your client list. I could improve that if you're as good as you say you are."
mitchell,But that is the only way to prove it.
allison,"Well, I could go for something..."
mitchell,"No, no, please, don't embarrass yourself. That's my final offer. Now, of course, if you would like to think about it..."
allison,I'll get this. You'll see it on my first expense report.
mitchell,I look forward to it.
graham,"What is this ? A song cue ? You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You. ALLISON It's just living alone, you know. I thought about buying those books like Cooking for One. It's just too depressing."
graham,"There are worse things than being on your own, you know."
allison,Maybe it's all a sign I should go home.
graham,Come on ! You came here for a reason. Sam has nothing to do with that. No guy does. You think I'd let some guy interfere with my acting career ? Assuming I had a career... or a guy to interfere with it.
allison,You'll find someone again.
graham,"Maybe I will. Why not ? But the point is, if I don't... I don't."
allison,I know that. I can do it on my own.
graham,Absolutely.
allison,I'll just get a room-mate.
graham,"You could always call him, Allie."
allison,Not if I have a room-mate.

allison,"Oh, yes, that's a promise. Rent-stabilized, so you couldn't come on the lease."
talkative applicant,"I'm an incest survivor, you know. I haven't remembered the instance yet, but I know it's there somewhere. I just have the sense that I survived something. All my therapists think so."
perfect applicant,"I think this could work. And if you feel the same, please give me a call."
allison,Oh !... Hi !
hedra,Hi !... The front door was kind of open. Are you Allison Jones ?
allison,Yes... I'm Allie.
hedra,"Oh, I'm Hedra Carlson. We spoke on the phone this morning."
hedra,Are you sure you're okay ?
allison,You know what ? I'm not. Would it be all right if you came back tomorrow ?
hedra,Why don't you just... sit down.
allison,"No, I'm fine."
hedra,I'll make you some tea.
allison,"I just... I don't think I had lunch, that's all. Hedra tries to get some water at the sink, but just gets a strange noise."
allison,It's only this one. The one in the bathroom works. Here...
allison,I use a wrench.
allison,Oh ! Wow !... Wow !... I'm so sorry. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
allison,"Oh, yes..."
allison,Hedra... that's unusual.
hedra,"I got terrible nicknames growing up, which I'm not telling you."
allison,Not Hedy ? Like Hedy Lamarr ? That's exotic.
hedra,"Well, I wasn't that exotic in grade school... as opposed to now, right ?"
hedra,"They're dry. She picks them up, gets them off the hangers, and gives her jacket to Allison"
hedra,Here.
allison,Thanks.
allison,Oh ! You can just toss that. I was just cleaning up. He's the reason why I'm looking for a new room-mate.
hedra,Oh !...
hedra,"Do you know if there is a chance that you guys patch things up ? As... I do not want to move in and catch you being bound again, and then have things change. It would just be awkward."
allison,"Well, nothing going to change it, except for... maybe that my faucets will work. When can you move in ?"
hedra,"No, really ?"
allison,Congratulations.
hedra,Thank you.
allison,I've got one friend. Graham. He lives just upstairs...
hedra,A friend ?
allison,"Oh, not like that : he's gay. So, anyway, it's not a real friendly building, but, at least, there's no problem with privacy. 'Cause, I mean, you just close your door..."
hedra,Yeah.
allison,No problem.
hedra,"I'll leave you alone, you know... I mean, whatever's good for you."
allison,Anyway.
hedra,Wow !
hedra,"Hey, look, Allie, this could be good, huh."
allison,Laundry room.
allison,"I don't go in there at night. It's a bit creepy. It's okay in the day, but, still, lock yourself in."
hedra,This one ?
allison,"No, that's mail key."
hedra,This is creepy.
allison,"Oh, it's not bad, it's just kind of old."
allison,Sometimes this gets stuck and you have to use this screwdriver.
allison,Excuse me.
the tenant,Which floor ?
allison,Eleven
hedra,"Fourteen, please."
hedra,Look what I found.
hedra,"Allie, it's Sam."
hedra,"Where do you guys learn to dress like that ? I mean, it's just so New York."
allison,I think you look very comfortable.
hedra,"Yeah, I never know what looks good."
allison,Oh !... I think that looks nice HEDRA Yes ?
allison,But I found this.
hedra,Oh !
allison,I think you'd look great with that.
hedra,Okay
hedra,Hey ! What do you think ?
allison,I think you should take them.
hedra,"Oh God, you like them ?"
allison,"Well, I think they go great with that dress."
hedra,You take them
allison,Well...
hedra,I'll just borrow them when I want to.
allison,"I was... I was... God, I'm sorry. You haven't even been here two weeks and I'm already in your room.  I was just about to go through your drawers !"
hedra,That smells nice on you.
allison,"Oh, I hope you don't mind. I just... I always wanted to try that."
hedra,"Oh God, no. anything you want... you want."
hedra,Go ahead. Share and share alike.
allison,Well... I don't really know about that. I'm an only child. Do you have... a big family ?
hedra,"I am... Well, I was supposed to be a twin, but she was stillborn."
allison,"Oh, that's so sad."
hedra,I grew up like a part of me was missing.
hedra,Allie ! God !
allison,Oh... nothing. It's just a little housewarming. It's like that.
allison,Oh no no...
hedra,Shhh !...
hedra,They look beautiful on you.
allison,But I can't take these.
hedra,It's housewarming.
allison,"Thanks, they're great."
allison,Excuse me.
hedra,Oops !
allison,Hello ?...
allison,"No, Sam. SAM  Why not ?... Why not ?..."
allison,"No, it's not a good time."
allison,"No, there's nothing to talk about anyway. Sam, there's somebody here right now..."
allison,All right ?... Okay... Bye.
hedra,Why don't we order some Chinese ?
answering machine,"Hi, this is Allison Jones. Please leave a message. Thank you."
hedra,Buddy !
hedra,"Oh, yes, you're a good clean boy. You're going to cheer her up, are you ? Hmm ? You're going to cheer her up. So she'll let you stay."
allison,Yoo-hoo !
answering machine,No messages.
hedra,"I know I shouldn't have, but they were just giving him away... in the market. But they said I could bring him back to-morrow."
allison,"Well, I hope they meant it."
hedra,Well... his name's Buddy. I had a dog named Buddy when I was little.
hedra,"Tomorrow, okay. I promise."
allison,Oh ! Come on.
allison,Okay. Come on. Shhh !
hedra,You're working so hard.
allison,"God, Hedy, thanks. I never would've got it done without you."
hedra,"I love helping. She tries to move the puppy, who wants to move the other way."
hedra,Wait... Wait...
hedra,Oh yeah ! Family portrait.
allison,Ready ?
hedra,Yeah.
graham,Ready to kill her yet ?
allison,"Who, Hedy ?"
graham,Hm-mm !
allison,"No, no, it's a lot of fun having a girlfriend again."
graham,I can tell. I was worried for a while that you were so down. You were starting to look like a Kennedy wife.
allison,"You were great, Graham. I just had to spend some time with her. She needed a lot of help moving in. Plus, I've been working like crazy. I promised I'm not avoiding you."
graham,"Oh, I've got you cornered now. I've been meaning to come down and see you. I was on my way to ask you something."
graham,Will you cat sit again ? I have to go to Boston this week- end for my cousin's wedding.
allison,"Fine. Sure, I'll watch Carmen."
allison,It's so cruel. We'll be fine.
graham,"You know, I think I saw her the other day, your room-mate. You were leaving the building. Then I thought it was you. Your backpack. This jacket. I chased her down. But it was someone else. Someone very nervous."
allison,Oh !... That's Hedy. I really freaked her out about people knowing she's living in the building. I would've had you down to meet her... but she's shy.
allison,Well.
allison,Friday ?
graham,That'll be great. I'll make dinner when I get back.
allison,"Hey, I thought you'd be at work."
hedra,No.
allison,Don't tell me we have the same belt. Hedra looks down at her belt. She seems embarrassed by something.
hedra,"Well... Yeah ... Sorry... Listen, I have to talk to you."
allison,"You have to see these. Look, cookies for dogs."
hedra,"Oh, they're great."
allison,I had to get them. They're so great.
hedra,Can I just talk to you for a second...
allison,Buddy !
hedra,I tried to let you know.
allison,What are you doing here ? Hedy !
sam,"But no, don't blame Hedy. It's not her fault, okay."
sam,I kind of forced my way in here. I had to see you. Hedra comes back in the hall.
hedra,I've got to get out of here now. Unless you need me...
hedra,Okay.
allison,Why can't you just leave me alone ?
sam,"You've got to talk to me, baby. You just can't pretend I don't exist. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY"
allison,"Easier that way, Okay ? Is that so hard to try to make it easier on me ?"
sam,"But people screw up. People do something wrong. And I was wrong, I admit it. And you just... You cut me off. You don't take my calls. You don't answer my letters."
allison,"Wait a minute. You lied to me ! If she hadn't called, would I have found out ? I think that's really scary, okay ? Please, if you want to be nice, just stay away."
sam,"Okay. You know, I know that there is something that you just can put back together. I was hoping that this wasn't one of them."
allison,"Well, I guess it is. And... I didn't get any letter. So, I wasn't trying to punish you by not answering it. I just didn't get it."
sam,"Well, I sent it with the keys."
allison,"Well, I didn't get those, either. What did it say ?"
sam,"Forget the letter. I love you. I can't exist without you. I have no excuse for what I did, Allie. You have to give me a second chance."
allison,"You really hurt me, Sam."
sam,Shhh !
hedra,"Oh, yes, towards the front, against the wall."
hedra,"Hi, Allie, it's me. I'm just calling to see if you're okay. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY"
sam,"Say... Next month, that would give her enough time."
allison,I don't know. Just got herself on hands. Haste wouldn't do. I'm sure she'll understand.
hotel clerk,"Good evening, Mister Rawson."
hedra,Hey ! It's not for you !
hedra,"Where the hell have you been ? Allison gasps at that somber voice in the dark. Hedra switches the bed-light on. She is sitting on Allison's bed, with her legs covered by the sheet, and the puppy on her laps. She is wearing her night-dress, with a pink sweater on her shoulders."
allison,"God, Hedy, what are you doing in my room ?"
hedra,"I've been waiting since six o'clock last night to hear from you. I'm worried sick. Buddy was crying. I thought I might as well come in here, so it calm down."
allison,"Sorry, I guess I just didn't think."
hedra,"No, you didn't. There's such a thing as a phone, you know. This is New York. Things happen."
allison,"Okay, okay, I'm sorry. It was thoughtless, really. You're making me feel like I'm sixteen years old here."
allison,"Hey, are you okay ?"
hedra,"Yeah... Yeah. Just... forget it. So, I guess you've patched things up with Sam, huh ?"
allison,"Yeah... Yeah, I made him suffer."
hedra,Is that an engagement ring ?
allison,Right.
hedra,Beautiful ring.
allison,Thanks.
hedra,Really great. She walks to the door.
hedra,I'm sure you'll be very happy ... you'll be very happy and I'll be alone.
allison,"No, no, wait a little. You'll find someone, Hedy. I mean, God, if I can..."
hedra,Why don't you look in the mirror ?... Huh ? Look !
hedra,Look ! You're in a different league. I know that. You have this great personality. You have this great style. You're running your own business. You're always going to find someone. You'd have to be stupid to think that you wouldn't.
hedra,"Well, I guess you... you and Sam want to be together. So... I have to move out, right ?... No ?"
allison,"Well, anyway, Sam's going to keep his place for a while. I know you just spent a lot on furniture."
hedra,"Yeah, your timing is great, Allie, it's really great ! You promised me this wouldn't happen. Exactly what..."
allison,"Nothing's happened, Hedy, come on. Look, I'll talk to Sam. Well... Well, maybe we'll move, I don't know. Maybe, we'll find some place like this, or... I don't know. But, we'll see, we'll figure something out. Okay ?"
allison,"Let's set up a demo, to show them something. Something special, something different, you know. Maybe at night, you know. Open bar, open minds. That's F night."
mitchell,"I'll set it up, I'll set it up. Maybe I... I'll call you tonight after I check on some things. ALLISON Great."
mitchell,"8796, Knox. Knox ? What's this Knox ?"
allison,"Oh no, that's Graham Knox. He is my upstair neighbor. That was just for last night. Oh, he's the first one."
mitchell,"Well, I've got to admit, I'm very impressed."
allison,"Well, maybe you start spreading the word."
mitchell,"You know, I can see I'm not going to be able to afford you any more."
allison,Great. Press enter. That's it.
allison,You thirsty ?
sam,No.
allison,"I'll be right back, okay."
hedra,"Well, you'd know more about that than I would."
hedra,"Oh, hi !"
hedra,"Oh well... Well I think I'll turn in. Goodnight, Allie."
hedra,"Goodnight, Sam."
sam,"Right, just a minute."
hedra,They'll get cold.
sam,"All right, all right."
sam,Hey !
hedra,Hi !
allison,We going ?
hedra,Scrambled or fried ?
sam,Why don't we get away together ? Drive to Box Camp ?
hedra,"Buddy, come here, boy. She takes a piece of bacon out of the plate and shows it to the puppy."
allison,"All right, Hedy, he's fine.  Poor guy's doesn't who's who anymore."
sam,"Well, wouldn't you like to take a day off... Renting a car..."
allison,"No, I'm okay. I'm fine. I just didn't get a very good sleep, that's all. Nightmares. Okay ?"
hedra,You've got a good day for it if it doesn't get too hot.
allison,"You don't have to do that, Hedy. You're doing enough already."
hedra,"Oh, I don't mind. It's clean when you can't tell I'm here."
hedra,"Oh... Hey, if the eggs were okay, maybe you guys can trust me with dinner. Do you know when you'll be back ?"
allison,"Oh, no, it's kind of an anniversary tonight. So I think we'll be eating out."
hedra,"Really ? Well, that's great... Well, good luck. We can see, by her expression, that Hedra is not very happy about what she just heard, but she keeps a smiling face."
hedra,Goodbye.
hedra,"Buddy, come here."
hedra,"Come here, sweetie."
hedra,I know... I know.
sam,But this is half the size for twice the price from your apartment.
allison,"It's easier this way, believe me. And this could be nice."
sam,Can you imagine going from The Victoria to this.
sam,Do you think we can smoke her out ?
allison,This is such a mess. I just can't do it right now. I think I'm her only friend.
hedra,What ?
hedra,But I thought we could leave it open. I know you fixed it this morning.
sam,I thought I did.
hedra,"It's me. I interrupted you when I called you in for breakfast. And Allie, it's my fault."
hedra,Allie !
sam,Allie !
sam,"Thanks, that pill helped."
hedra,Are you still going on that trip tomorrow ?
sam,"Well, she wants me to."
hedra,If I'd just let you finish your work this morning...
sam,"Listen, if she blames anybody, she blames me, huh ?"
sam,Shh !
allison,What ?
allison,"God ! I know... I'm... No, I'm just... I'm just running a little late."
allison,"I didn't forget. I dunno... Just hold them till five, okay ? Thanks."
mitchell,"...but you know that, don't you ?"
allison,Thank you.
mitchell,"And here, I thought all the guys would resist you. As if anyone ever could."
allison,"Oh no, here, I've got to go. I'm just cleaning a bit."
mitchell,Hold it. Hold it. Not so fast. Now everybody under me knows more than I do. I hate that.
allison,Well... Block up some time for me next week. Then... it's just a little late tonight.
mitchell,"Oh, please, please, just a taste."
mitchell,Something simple. Right now.
allison,Okay... Something simple.
allison,"All right... You know, this is just the Mickey-Mouse stuff, but it does come in handy. Close-up on the computer screen. The Fontana Fashions file is on. We see the outline of a model, then a small window appears on the model. It says Are you sure you want to quit ? and below two choices, Cancel or OK. Allison chooses OK. Fontana Fashions file disappears, replaced by another window that says Search by vendor, and in the bottom of the window, Enter Vendor Name:, with an empty box underneath."
allison,Okay. Enter the vendor's name.
mitchell,Oh !... Vendor...
mitchell,J-o-n-e-s... All..i...son.
allison,Very good.
mitchell,"Ho-ho. According to this, we should have paid you last Friday."
allison,That's all right. Barbara will handle that.
mitchell,Not till I give her the word.
allison,"Well, I hope you're satisfied with what I've done."
mitchell,So far.
allison,"But this is it. I mean, there ain't much more. Just maybe a little fine tuning, that's it. I have some free time now, if you want us to set up some meeting with your colleagues."
mitchell,I was thinking that maybe I want to keep you all to myself.
mitchell,Top her ?
allison,What are you doing ?
mitchell,"That's just that you're so tight. ALLISON Mitch, please, don't. That's enough."
allison,Mitch...
mitchell,"Hey, look..."
mitchell,"I've been a good boy, haven't I ? And you've been a good girl. We have nothing to prove any more."
mitchell,This is your last chance to play before you're an old married lady.
allison,"Let me turn around, okay ?"
mitchell,That's better. That's better.
mitchell,Just a second... A second...
mitchell,Fucking bitch !
allison,I can't believe I didn't see it coming. It's just so humiliating.
allison,But what I did... It was like something inside taking over. It was scary.
hedra,"No, Allie, don't turn this around. You're the victim. He should pay for this."
allison,"He'll pay. I set up all my programs, so they have to eventually."
hedra,"What ! I'm not talking about getting paid, I'm talking about getting even."
allison,You don't understand. It's the contacts more than the money. When I just took the job for the word of mouth and now that's gone. It's just like he's put me back to square one.
hedra,"Only if you let him. But you won't let him, will you ?"
allison,What can I do ?
hedra,"Oh, Allie..."
hedra,"Of course, Sam's away. I didn't want to say anything... How he could go on that trip the day after Buddy died."
hedra,"Hello ! May I speak with your husband, please ?"
allison,Who are you calling ?
hedra,"Yes, I know it's late. Tell him it's Allison Jones, he'll take the call."
allison,Who are you talking ? Hedra shushes Allison with her finger.
hedra,"Listen, you pathetic shit. Do you want to hold on to your business ?... No, you listen to me this time, asshole ! If you trash me around town, you're fucked and your family is fucked, too ! You got that ? It won't just be you."
hedra,"Let me tell you, he is pissing in his p.j.'s right now."
allison,"Gee, Hedy, I hope you never get mad at me."
allison,"Oh, Hedy, I'm not really up for this today."
hedra,What ?
hedra,"No, no, no, this is going to be fun. It'll make you feel better, promise. Okay ? And I'm paying. Go."
hedra,Let's go.
allison,"Oh, Hedy. HEDRA It'll be fine, come on."
allison,Thank you.
allison,You've got to be kidding.
allison,You just should've asked first.
hedra,"Well, I wanted it to be a surprise. They stop at a newspaper stand."
allison,"Can I have the Consumer Market, please."
hedra,This feels so good on my neck. I didn't think you'd mind.
allison,Thank you... please.

allison,Have fun.
hedra,Yeah.
hedra,I love myself like this.
hedra,Taxi !

hedra,Yes.
jim,Yes.
graham,"Jesus, Allie, what is it ?"
allison,"God, you've got to help me, Graham. You've got to tell me what to do."
hedra,Allie ?
hedra,I'm home.
hedra,Allie ?
hedra,Allie ?
hedra,God...
allison,And she stole a letter that Sam wrote me. I have to do something. Graham gets up from the couch.
graham,Get rid of her.
allison,You're right. I'll tell her tonight.
allison,"I can't just throw her out on the street. I mean, she obviously needs help."
graham,"She is a lunatic, Allie. She's got to go. Do it tonight."
graham,"Allie, either she's gone by Saturday, or I go to the police, okay ?"
allison,That was very impressive.
graham,I can be butch when I have to. I got it from my mother. GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
allison,Thanks.
allison,"Oh, tomorrow."
graham,That's good. ALLISON Yeah.
graham,"Oh, this is a little embarrassing, but since we're letting our hair down... Those old air vents between our apartments carry sound. It's a weird acoustic thing."
allison,Oh... What do you hear ?
allison,"Oh, no ! Oh no ! I'm... I'm sorry."
graham,Big deal. I am sorry. I should've mentioned it sooner.
allison,I'm so sorry.
graham,You're sure you want to go down there ?
allison,Yeah. She's my problem. I'll handle it.
graham,Okay.
allison,Hedy ? She puts her keys on the shelf by the door.
allison,Hedy ?
allison,Hedy ?
graham,"I don't know. I don't even know what hyper-vigilant is. No, I've never met the woman. She could be infantile or paranoid, whatever. I don't know..."
graham,"I tell you what, let me go downstairs. If I call you from there, will you talk to my friend ? She can tell you better than I can. Right, okay."
graham,Carmen...
graham,Allie !
hedra,Goodnight.
graham,"Hedy ? She turns around. She seems very panicky suddenly. She starts fumbling with the locks of the door, and drops the safety bar on the floor."
hedra,I'm sorry...
graham,"Wait... hey, wait, it's okay. Take it easy. Take it... We just want to get you some help."
hedra,"No, Please... Please... I didn't do anything wrong."
graham,"Okay, take it easy. HEDRA I'm sorry, I didn't do anything."
graham,No problem.
allison,"Hello, Mr. Besch, you don't know me, my name is Allison Jones. I think my room-mate Hedra is your daughter. Ellen. I'm not sure, really. She's... She's been under a lot of stress lately... And... Well... Huh... Huh... God... I really, really would not get into this on the answering machine. Could you please give me a call ? Or her ? I'm"
hedra,What ?
hedra,I can't hear you.
allison,"It's okay, it's just I was starting to worry. You've been in here so long. I'm making some tea. Do you want some tea ? Camomile."
hedra,Yeah... that'd be great.
hedra,Mine always comes when I'm wearing something nice.
hedra,About what ?
allison,About Sam and I wanting this place for ourselves...
allison,...It's just crazy keeping two places like this.
hedra,"Well... Well, I... I thought you wanted a long engagement so you could make sure you can trust him again."
allison,"Well, frankly, I think that's my business. I'm sorry, but it is."
allison,"No, that's not it at all. You've been a good room-mate. It's just... This is the man I'm going to marry. I want us to start our lives together."
hedra,"Well... He will cheat on you again, that's a promise. And when he does, don't come running to me, okay ? Cause... I've had it with you. You're so fucking weak !"
hedra,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
hedra,Allie ?
hedra,Hello ?
allison,Is it Sam ?
hedra,"Find someone else, jerk !"
allison,I'm expecting a call from Sam. He might be coming in tonight.
hedra,"Just for a little while, okay. Sam will call back if it's busy."
hedra,"It's no big deal. I'll find some other place. You know, I just... I don't want you making a mistake."
allison,"I understand. Hey, we'll still be friends. We'll keep in touch."
hedra,Sure.
sam,Oh... I just got in from the airport. Is she asleep ?
sam,Okay.
sam,"Goodnight, honey."
hedra,"Goodnight, Sam. Sleep well."
sam,Oh... Oh... Jesus !... Oh... Gee...
sam,Allie ?
hedra,"No, not Allie."
hedra,Hey !
hedra,"Hey, sleepy guy."
hedra,I knew it.
sam,Knew what ?
hedra,I told her. Guys like you don't change. You can't be faithful. And now she'll know.
sam,She'll know what ?
sam,"That you came up here and pretended to be her ? My God, what is this hair ? What is this supposed to mean ? You're in her clothes. You're wearing her perfume! For Christ- sake !"
hedra,"You knew it was me. Come on ! You knew and you didn't care. Well, I think she should know that."
sam,"You think she's going to thank you for that news, do you ?"
hedra,"Well, I don't expect you to understand her friendship."
sam,"She can't... she can't stand you, for Christ-sake !"
hedra,That's not true.
sam,"Oh, bullshit !"
hedra,Huh-huh.
sam,You're too needy. You're always cleaning. You're constantly in her face.
hedra,She needs me. Who was there for her when her boss almost raped her ?
sam,What ?
hedra,Could you care of her ? You were off on a business trip or screwing someone.
sam,She never said a word to me about that.
hedra,"That's right, she told me."
hedra,So... don't try and make me think that we're not close. We lean on each other and we... we protect each other. We're best friends.
sam,"You're nuts, you know that ? Yes... I think you're out of your skull, that's right."
hedra,"Yeah, well, sticks and stones..."
hedra,Sam !
sam,Don't touch me ! She sits back on the bed.
hedra,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, I know you want to save face. I won't tell her, okay ? Just... Just pick up the phone and call her and tell her you're going back to your ex-wife, or something. And I won't say a word, okay ?"
sam,"Yeah... Well, you won't have to say a word, sweetheart, because I'm going to tell her myself."
sam,Fucking bitch !
hotel clerk,"Goodnight, Miss Jones."
hedra,Goodnight.
allison,Hedy ?... Hedy ?
allison,"Hedy ? Hedra looks up at Allison, but doesn't stop her cleaning."
hedra,"Oh, hi ! I hope I didn't wake you. I got an early start."
allison,"No, Hedy, I didn't mean for you to move out today."
hedra,"Oh, there, I think that's it."
hedra,I hope you don't mind. I'm storing some of my stuff in the cage downstairs.
hedra,"That way, I won't have to bother... You see what I mean... You know... I mean..."
allison,"Sure, that's fine. Look, I'm really sorry it didn't work out."
hedra,"Well, I'd better get this stuff out of here. Allison walks to the door."
allison,I'll help.
allison,We can have breakfast when you get back.
hedra,Allie ?
hedra,What are you doing down there ?
allison,Oh... I just suddenly felt sick. It was the funniest thing. I hope I'm not pregnant.
hedra,Let me help you.
allison,"Oh, that's all right, I'm fine."
hedra,I'll get some water.
hedra,Drink some.
hedra,Okay ?
hedra,Feeling better ? ALLISON Yeah. I can go out for a while. I feel much better now.
hedra,I thought you said breakfast ?
allison,"Oh, it's in the blender. I've got to go out."
hedra,Dressed like that?
allison,I'm out. I'm just going to go upstairs and see Graham. He called while you were out.
hedra,"Well, still, if you're not feeling well, you should wear more than that."
allison,Maybe you're right.
hedra,You know why I think you're sick ?
hedra,You're upset about Sam.
hedra,"You know Sam's dead, don't you ?"
hedra,"Yeah, we don't have much time."
allison,Why ?... Why ?
hedra,"Allie, he came in my mouth. Then he tried to beat the shit out of me because I wanted to tell you."
hedra,"Okay, come on. The police will be here soon."
allison,"But... but you shouldn't run. That'll only make it worse. I know you weren't yourself when you did this, Hedy."
hedra,I know. I was you.
hedra,"No one's seen her. She's not on the lease. There's not even a fingerprint of hers here. I've been cleaning like crazy. You have to come with me, Allie, or they'd put you away."
allison,"Hedy, it'll never work. Besides ... people have seen you. We just can't tell. We'll go to a lawyer or a doctor and they'll explain it to the police, or something."
hedra,No.
hedra,Why are you making me do this ?
hedra,"We're friends, Allie. You could be in a lot of trouble without me. But I'm not going to leave you."
hedra,"That wouldn't be right. I won't leave you. Okay, let's go. Up ! Up ! Up !"
hedra,Go ! Go-go-go !
hedra,"No-no, up to Graham's. Come on. No-no, he's already involved."
allison,Nobody's home.
hedra,"Use these. Come on, come on, hurry up. Go !"
allison,He must be sleeping. We were up late last night.
allison,Graham ?
hedra,He can't hear you.
hedra,"Your color was beautiful, but I can't go around looking like you any more, can I ?"
hedra,"Okay now, Allie, don't laugh."
hedra,Ta-dah !
hedra,How's that ? Good ?
hedra,22 and 24 are the movie channels. I've got to cash a pay cheque. So I'll only be gone an hour. I know how you hate to be alone. Okay... Are you good and comfortable ? All right.
hedra,"So, well... When I get back, we'll do your hair, too. Okay ? Be good. Bye."
hedra,Excuse me ?
cashier girl,"You're an actress, right ? You're never the same person twice."
cashier girl,I like it. I just thought the other was more you.
hedra,"Well, maybe next time I'll try blonde."
cashier girl,Really ? I'm flattered. Thanks.
bank clerk,Miss Besch ?
hedra,Yes ?
bank clerk,A man's been calling here. Says he's your father.
building manager,Hey !
allison,Mmmm !
hedra,Oh !
building manager,You live here ?
hedra,"No, no, I'm just watching the place for the week-end like that. It's on a timer. Huh... Huh... I'm sorry."
building manager,I have to register a complaint.
hedra,"Please, I'll turn it off. I will. She enters the apartment and closes the door shut behind her."
hedra,"How could you do that ? Everything I've done, I've done for you. Don't you understand that ? People you hated, I hated."
hedra,"Just like that stupid girl in Tampa. She called my parents, too. Told them all my secrets."
hedra,"You want to put me away, huh ?"
hedra,"I can't... I can't keep making excuses for you, Allie. I can't... I can't... I can't... I can't... I can't..."
hedra,Oh God !... Oh God !... Ohhh !
hedra,What ?... What ?
allison,Please...
hedra,No.
allison,Shhh !... It's okay. It's okay.
barbara,Jesus...
barbara,Mitch !
mitchell,What ? He doesn't stop rocking the armchair.
mitchell,What ?
mitchell,What is it ? What?
barbara,Look.
barbara,It's erasing.
barbara,I didn't do anything.
mitchell,Shit !
mitchell,"...in 24 hours of the rest of your data will be irretrievably lost. This payment policing program is installed on all of Allison Jones software."" Mitchell jumps up."
mitchell,Bitch !
allison,Great.
hedra,Can you make reservations on this ?
allison,Hm-m. And you can pay by credit card.
allison,"L.A., right ?"
hedra,Yeah.
mitchell,Busy.
mitchell,You turn them off.  Turn them all off !
hedra,"Things are going to be different in L.A, Allie. You'll see."
allison,First class ?
hedra,Is it worth it ?
allison,"Well, we can use one of Graham's cards. I think I saw his wallet in the living room."
hedra,"Oh... Me too. Okay, I'll go and see."
allison,I know I saw it somewhere. Maybe it's in the kitchen.
allison,No ! No ! No ! No !
hedra,Going down.
mitchell,"Oh... Excuse me, miss, is this 1203 ? Is Graham Knox at home ?"
hedra,"No, he's on a cruise."
mitchell,"Actually, I'm looking for a woman Allison Jones ? Do you know her ?"
hedra,Who are you ?
mitchell,Mitchell Myerson.
mitchell,She did a job for me.
hedra,Oh... There's no one named Jones on this floor.
mitchell,"Yeah, I know that. I was just down at her apartment. But I did contact her here once. HEDRA Well, I'm the only one here and I never met her. So... You'll excuse me."
mitchell,"Oh, sorry."
mitchell,This is hers. You do know her.
allison,"Be careful, she's crazy."
hedra,Get off of her.
mitchell,What ?
hedra,"You think she wants you touching her, huh ? I said get off her !"
mitchell,"Okay, okay... I'm... I'm getting up. Okay. He gets up very slowly with his hands raised at his shoulders level. And suddenly, he grabs the gun and throws Hedra across the room. She falls on a round table, which breaks under her weight. She remains motionless on the floor."
allison,Where is she ?
mitchell,"Don't worry about her, I took care of her."
hedra,I don't want to try to be loved any more. And you know...
hedra,"I don't want to be scared any more. Or to kill any more. I don't want to kill any more. I don't want to be alone any more. I don't want to be anything any more. I don't need a reason to kill myself, I need a reason not to and there isn't one."
hedra,"Okay, Allison Jones, go on."
hedra,Now they'll know it was you.
allison,"No one who knows me will believe that I wrote that. I was never that scared. Well... not like that. HEDRA Of course it's you. I never met anyone so scared of being alone. And I saved you from that, but you don't care."
hedra,Did you know that identical twins are never really identical ? There's always one that's prettier. And the one who's not does all the work. She used me and then she left me. Just like you.
hedra,"Come on... take them. Come on, Allie, it's nicer this way."
allison,Okay.
hedra,Allie !
hedra,Please...
hedra,Please...
allison,"I'm not like your sister, Hedy. Not any more. I'm like you now."
hedra,I'll kill you !
allison,Get off him !
allison,"Graham, stay inside !"
hedra,No... No... No...
hedra,No... No... No...
hedra,Allie ?
hedra,"Hey, here you are."
hedra,"Don't make me come get you... Allie, come out now... Come on... Allie !..."
hedra,I'm scared ! Where are you ? The rat has reached Allison's hiding place. She pushes it down from the pipe where it was standing.
hedra,Why are you hiding from me ?
hedra,"You think I can't find you ? Huh ? Your goddam shirt is sticking out of it. She opens the door, sees herself in a mirror at the back of the closet, and thinking it's Allison, bangs her hook on the mirror and breaks it."
hedra,Allie...
