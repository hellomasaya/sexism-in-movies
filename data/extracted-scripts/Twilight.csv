Speaker,Dialogue
shooting draft,"February 11, 2008"
bella,Have a good..
bella,... life.
rene,"It won't work again, baby."
bella,You put it on hold.
rene,I did?
bella,Look. You also called Mexico.
bella,Very romantic.
phil,"If you call crappy motels, backwater towns and ballpark hot dogs romantic."
rene,"Now, you know if you change your mind, I'll race back here from wherever the game is."
bella,"I won't change my mind, mom."
rene,You might. You've always hated Forks.
bella,"It's not about Forks, it's about Dad. I mean, two weeks a year, we barely know each other."
charlie,Your hair's longer.
bella,I cut it since last time I saw you.
charlie,Guess it grew out again.
charlie,How's your mom?
bella,Good.
bella, That's right. One bathroom.
charlie,I'll just put these up in your room -
bella,I can do it -
charlie,"Bella, you remember Billy Black."
billy,Glad you're finally here. Charlie hasn't shut up about it since you told him you were coming.
charlie,"Keep exaggerating, I'll wheel you down the hill."
billy,Right after I ram you in the ankles.
jacob,I'm Jacob. We made mud pies together when we were little kids.
bella,Yeah... I think I remember.. .  Are they always like this?
jacob,It's getting worse with old age.
charlie,So what do you think of your homecoming gift?
bella,No way. The truck is for me?
charlie,"Just bought it off Billy, here."
jacob,I rebuilt the engine and - -
bella,It's perfect!
jacob,"Okay, so you gotta double pump the clutch when you shift, but - -"
bella,Maybe I can give you a ride to school.
jacob,I go to school on the reservation.
bella,Too bad. Would've been nice to know at least one person.
eric,"You're Isabella Swan, the new girl. Hi. I'm Eric. The eyes and ears of this place. Anything you need. Tour guide, lunch date, shoulder to cry on."
bella,I'm kind of the suffer in silence type.
eric,"Good headline for your feature - I'm on the paper, and you're news, baby, front page."
eric,"Whoa, chillax. No feature."
eric,"You've missed a lot of the semester, but I can hook you up - tutor, cliff notes, medical excuse.. ."
jessica,"Block it, Chloe! Yeah! Good attack!"
bella,"(hurries to him,"
mike,It's only a flesh wound.
mike,"You're Isabella, right?"
mike,I'm Mike. Newton.
jessica,"She's got a great spike, doesn't she?"
bella,That's why they kicked me out.
eric,"Mike, you met my home girl Bella."
mike,Your home girl?
angela,"Sorry, needed a candid for the feature -"
eric,"Feature's dead, Angela. Don't bring it up again."
bella,"Sorry. There's always eating disorders, or Speedo padding on the swim team -"
angela,"-- Wait, that's a good one.. ."
bella,Who are they?
angela,The Cullens.
jessica,Doctor and Mrs. Cullen's foster kids. They all moved down here from Alaska two years ago.
angela,They kinda keep to themselves.
jessica,"Because they're all together. Like, together together. The blonde girl, Rosalie, and the big dark-haired guy, Emmett.. ."
jessica,... they're a thing. I'm not even sure that's legal.
jessica,"But they live together. And the little dark haired girl, Alice, she's really weird.. ."
jessica,"... she's with Jasper, the blonde who looks like he's in pain. I mean, Dr. Cullen's like this foster dad slash match maker."
angela,Maybe he'll adopt me.
bella,Who's he?
jessica,That's Edward Cullen.
jessica,"He's totally gorgeous, obviously. But apparently, no one here is good enough for him. Like I care."
bella,I wasn't planning on it.
edward, I'll just... endure it.
bella,Jerk.
charlie,"Waylon, she hasn't had a Christmas here since she was four."
waylon,"Bet I made an impression, though."
charlie,You always do.
cora,"Let the girl eat her cod, Waylon."
bella," That'd be great, thank you."
bella,So... you eat here every night?
charlie,Easier than washing dishes.
bella,I can cook.
bella,I do the cooking at home - in Phoenix. Mom's not great in the kitchen.
charlie,I remember.. .
charlie,How was school? Meet anyone?
charlie, Are people talking about them again?
bella,"No... well, a little."
charlie,Just cause they're newcomers. We're lucky to have a surgeon like Dr. Cullen at our podunk hospital. Lucky his wife wanted to live in a small town. Lucky his kids aren't like a lot of the hell-raisers around here.
bella,... Okay.
charlie,I just don't like narrow mindedness.
bella,"Mom, where's your cell?"
rene,"Ok, I didn't lose my power cord. It ran away. Screaming. I literally repel technology now."
charlie,"That's why I got you new tires. She looks over at the truck -- yep, four new tires. CHARLIE"
bella,I mean... nothing.
charlie,I'll be late for dinner. I'm heading down to Mason County. A security guard at the Grisham Mill got killed by some kind of animal.. .
bella,An animal?
charlie,"You're not in Phoenix any more, honey. They've been hunting it for a week with no luck. Thought I'd lend a hand."
bella,Be careful.
charlie,Always am.
bella,And thank you. For the tires.
eric,"... and yeah, prom committee is a chick thing, but I gotta cover it for the paper anyway, and they need a guy to help choose the music - - So I need your play list -"
mike,"Come on, Arizona. Give it up for the rain."
bella,Terrific.
edward,Hello.
edward,I didn't have a chance to introduce myself last week. My name is Edward Cullen.
edward, ... You're Bella.
bella,I'm... yes.
edward,Ladies first.
bella,You've been gone.
edward,Out of town. For personal reasons.
bella,Prophase.
edward,May I look?
edward,Prophase.
bella, Like I said.
edward,Enjoying the rain?
bella,Seriously? You're asking me about the weather?
edward,It appears.
bella,No. I don't like the cold. Or the wet. Or the gray. Or parkas. Or turtle necks.
edward,Like I said.
bella,It's complicated.
edward,I think I can keep up.
bella,My mother remarried.
edward,Very complex. So you don't like him.
bella,"Phil is fine. Young for her, but nice enough."
edward,But now you're unhappy.
bella,No... I -- I just.. .
bella,Did you get contacts?
edward,... no.
edward,It's just the fluorescents.
charlie,Bells. Are you alright?
bella,"I'm fine, dad. Calm down."
tyler,"I'm so sorry, Bella. I tried to stop."
bella,"It's okay, Tyler."
charlie,It sure as hell is not okay.
bella,"Dad, it's not his fault-"
bella,But you didn't.
charlie,You can kiss your license goodbye.
charlie,Good. Dr. Cullen.
tyler,"I'm so sorry, Bella. I'm really -"
bella,It would have been a lot worse if Edward hadn't knocked me out of the way.
charlie,Edward? Your boy?
bella,It was amazing he got to me so fast. He was nowhere near me.
charlie,I just have to sign some paperwork. You better call your mom.
bella,You told her?! She's probably freaking.
rosalie,"This isn't just about you, it's about all of us - -"
bella,Can I talk to you for a moment?  How did you get over to me so quickly?
edward,I was standing right next to you.
bella,"You were next to your car, across the lot."
bella,Yes. You were.
edward,You're confused. You hit your head.
bella,I know what I saw.
edward,"And what, exactly, was that?"
bella,You stopped that van. You pushed it away.
edward,No one will believe that.
bella,I wasn't planning to tell anyone.
bella,I just want to know the truth.
edward,Can't you just thank me and get over it?
edward,"You're not going to let it go, are you?"
bella,No.
edward, Then I hope you enjoy disappointment.
bella,Why did you even bother?
edward,... I don't know.
bella,"... Yeah, false alarm.. ."
mike,"Actually, I'm glad you're not dead cause - well, that would suck, plus I wanted to ask you - even though it's, like, a month away.. ."
mike,So what do you think?  You want to go? To prom. With me.
bella," Prom. As in dance. I, uh - have to go"
bella,Non-refundable ticket. Maybe you should ask Jessica.
bella,"Hello, Edward."
bella,Really?
bella,How did you know about that?
edward,You didn't answer my question.
bella,You haven't answered any of mine. You won't even say hello.
edward,Hello.
bella,And how did you stop that van?
edward,Adrenaline rush. Very common. Google it.
edward,It helps if you actually watch where you put your feet.
edward,"I know I've been rude, but it's for the best."
jessica,Guess who just asked me to prom!
jessica,"I totally thought Mike was going to ask you, Bella. Is it gonna be weird?"
bella,No way. Zero weirdness. You guys are great together.
jessica,"I know, right?"
edward,"Bella, it would be better if we weren't friends."
edward, You think I regret saving you?
bella,I know you do.
edward, You don't know anything.
alice,The bus is leaving.  Hi. Will you be riding with us?
edward,No. Our bus is full.
charlie,Your mother called. Again.
bella,"Your fault, for telling her about the accident."
charlie,She always did know how to worry.
bella,He is.
eric,"La Push, baby. You in?"
bella,Should I know what that means?
mike,"La Push beach, down on the Quileute rez. We're all going after school. Big swell coming in."
eric,And I don't just surf the internet.
jessica,"Eric, you stood up once. On a foam board."
angela,"There's whale watching, too. Come with."
eric,"La Push, baby."
bella,I'll go if you stop saying that.
bella,Thanks... but your mood swings are giving me whiplash.
edward,"I said it would be better if we weren't friends, not that I didn't want to be."
edward,"It means if you were smart, you'd avoid me."
bella,"So let's say, for argument's sake, that I'm not smart. Would you talk to me? Tell me the truth?"
edward,Probably not. I'd rather hear your theories.
bella,Okay... how bout radioactive spiders? Kryptonite?
edward,"(levels his gaze,"
bella," No. I don't believe that. You're not bad. You can be a jerk, but it's like this... mask. To keep people away."
bella,"Look, why don't we just - hang out. Like... come to the beach with us. It'll be fun - sand fleas, wind burn, salt water stinging your eyes.. ."
edward, Which beach?
bella,La Push.
bella,Is something wrong with that beach?
edward,It's just a little crowded.
angela,"I keep thinking Eric's going to ask me to prom, then he just... doesn't."
bella,You could ask him. (off Angela's flustered
angela,I am?
bella,"Guys, this is Jacob. Are you stalking me?"
jacob,"You're on my rez, remember? You surfing?"
bella,Definitely not.
jessica, Keep her company. Her date bailed.
eric,What date?
bella, To be polite.
angela,I think it's nice she invited him. No one ever does.
mike,Because Cullen's a freak.
sam,You got that right.
bella,You know them?
sam, The Cullens don't come here.
bella,You want to go look at tide pools?
bella,"So, what did your friend mean about the Cullens not coming here?"
jacob,"Oops. Caught that, huh?"
jacob,I'm not supposed to say anything.
bella,I can keep a secret.. .
bella,"Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath?"
bella,So the legend about the Cullens is.. .
jacob,"Well, they're supposedly descended from this, like.. ."
bella,Didn't they just move here?
jacob,Or just moved back.
bella,Riiiight. So what was this treaty?
bella,Wait... what were they really?
waylon,Jerry?
waylon,"Come on, Jerry, you old mutt.. ."
waylon,H-how did you do that?
james,Always the same inane questions.. .
james,What do you want?
laurent," ... James, must we?"
james,"The question should be, will it hurt?"
bella,They just... ditch?
bella,It's a family thing.
jessica,"Oh my God, we need to hit the stores in Port Angeles before the dresses get cleaned out."
bella,Port Angeles?.. .  Can I go with you guys?
angela,Thank God. We need your opinion.
jessica,"I think this halter makes my boobs look big. What do you think, Bella?"
jessica,Bella?
bella, It looks great.
jessica,You said that about the last five dresses.
angela,You sure?
bella,"Look, just take my bag."
bella,"What -- no, how did you find -- ?"
edward, I should go back and rip their heads off.
bella,No. Bad idea.
edward,"You don't know the vile, repulsive things they were thinking."
bella,And you do?
edward, Not hard to guess.
angela,Where were you!? We left you a message.
jessica,"We waited, but we were starving -"
edward,Sorry I kept Bella from dinner. We ran into each other and got talking.
bella,"Okay, well. Thank you."
angela,That's so... thoughtful.
jessica,Really thoughtful.
bella, I could eat.
bella,You're not eating?
edward,I'm on a special diet.
bella,Like South Beach?
edward,Not exactly.
edward,"Yes, no. To get to the other side,"
bella,I didn't ask for the square root of pi.
edward,You knew that?
bella,How did you know where I was?
edward,I didn't.
edward, Don't go.
bella,Were you following me?
edward,I feel very protective of you.
bella,So that's a yes?
edward,"Yes, I followed you. I tried to keep my distance...until you needed help."
bella, You said before... That you heard what those guys were thinking.. . Can you... read minds?
bella,"Why, what's wrong with me?"
edward,I tell you I read minds and you think there's something wrong with you?
bella,What is it?
edward,I... don't have the strength to stay away from you anymore.
bella,"Edward, you don't have to."
edward, This is wrong.
bella,Edward -
edward,You're cold. We should go.
bella,"Your hand, it's still freezing cold."
edward,That's my father's car. What's he -- ?
edward,Carlisle. What happened?
bella,He died? How?
bella,The same kind that killed the security guard down in Mason?
bella,So it's getting closer to town.
edward,Waylon lived all the way down on Queets River. 75 miles south.
bella,But that's -
bella,"Dad, I'm sorry about Waylon."
charlie,Known him going on thirty years.
charlie,"We'll get to the bottom of this, Bella. But in the meantime.. ."
charlie,... I want you to have this.
bella,That's probably not a good -
bella,How old are you?
edward,Seventeen.
bella,How long have you been seventeen?
edward,... A while.
bella,I know what the Cold Ones are. What you are.
edward,Say it. Out loud. Say it.
bella,... Vampire
edward,Are you afraid?
bella,No.
bella,You won't hurt me. You're different.
edward,You think you know me?
bella,Where are we going?
edward,Up the mountain. Out of the cloud bank. You need to see what I really am. What I look like in the harsh light of the sun.
bella,No! The sunlight will kill you.
edward,Myth. You need to see the truth.
bella,Slow down.
edward,Are you afraid?
bella,No.
edward,Then come with me. Someplace where no one can protect you. Where I could do what I've wanted to do from the first moment I met you.
bella,I'm not afraid.
edward,Hold on.
edward,Are you afraid! ?
bella,No!
bella,Edward? Where are you?
bella,You're... beautiful.. .
bella,I don't believe that.
edward,"Because you believe the lie. The camouflage. I'm the world's most dangerous predator. Everything about me invites you in - my voice, my face, even my smell. As if I need any of that.. ."
edward,As if you could outrun me. As if you could fight me off.
edward,I'm designed to kill.
bella,I don't care.
edward,I've killed people.
bella,It doesn't matter.
bella,I trust you.
edward,Don't.
bella,"I trust you, Edward. I'm here."
bella,Edward?
edward,You... took me by surprise.  I don't know how to... do this.
edward,"Me, and my family, we're different from others of our kind. We're not nomadic, we have a permanent home. We only hunt animals. We've learned to control our thirst.. ."
bella, Oh... I thought you hated me when we met.
edward,I did. For making me want you so badly. I'm still not sure I can control myself.
bella,I know you can.
edward,I wish I could understand this thing you see in me. You look at me with those eyes.. .
bella,I'm afraid.
edward, Good.
bella,Not of that. I'm afraid... you'll disappear. That I'll lose you.
edward,Be very still.
edward,And so the lion fell for the lamb.
bella,Stupid lamb.
edward,Sick masochistic lion.
bella,How long have you been like this?
edward,Since nineteen-eighteen. That's when Carlisle found me.
bella,Where'd he find you?
edward,"In a hospital, dying of Spanish influenza. My parents had already died."
edward,"Not just. Our bite contains venom. And once we taste blood, a sort of.. . frenzy begins. It's almost impossible to stop."
edward,"First with me, then with his wife, Esme. He found her in a hospital, as well. The others followed."
edward,"... No, that's just Carlisle. He would never do... this, to someone who had another choice."
bella,"So Carlisle's the reason why you hunt animals, instead of people."
edward,Not the only reason.
edward,"We call ourselves vegetarians, by the way... For our kind, hunting animals is like living on tofu. It keeps you strong but isn't very satisfying."
bella,Show off.
edward,"It's not that impressive, really. Anyone in my family can do this."
bella,"Can they all read minds, too?"
edward,"No, that's unique to me. But Alice can see the future."
edward,Her visions are very subjective. The future can change.
edward,Come to my house tomorrow.
bella,Your house? With your family?
bella,I'm glad I amuse you.
bella,What is it?
edward,A complication.
edward,I'll pick you up tomorrow.
bella,Come to visit your truck?
jacob,Looks good. You got that dent out.
billy,"Actually, we came to visit your flat screen. First Mariners game of the season. Plus Jacob here kept bugging me to see you again."
charlie,Pale Ale.
billy, Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry.
billy,Any luck with the Waylon case?
bella,A person did that?
jacob,"A crazy person, walking around barefoot this time of year."
charlie,"Spread the word out at the rez, will ya? Keep the kids out of the woods."
billy,Will do.  Don't want no one else getting hurt.
bella,"It's... wonderful. EDWARD You expected turrets, dungeons and moats? BELLA No... not moats. He takes her hand. She girds herself. They head inside."
edward,Thanks to tinted windows... It's the one place we never have to hide.
bella,Bon giorno?
esme,Molto bene!
esme,I hope you're hungry.
bella,"Oh, absolutely -"
edward,She already ate.
rosalie,Perfect.
bella,"I just assumed -- because you don't eat, you know.. ."
esme,Of course. That was very considerate of you.
edward, Ignore her. I do.
rosalie,"Yes, let's keep pretending this isn't dangerous for all of us."
bella,"I would never, ever tell anyone."
emmett,"The problem is, you two have gone public now, so.. ."
rosalie,"No, she should know."
bella,... Badly?
bella," And you're Jasper, right?"
jasper,Pleasure to meet you.
alice," You won't hurt her, Jasper."
edward,I'll give you a tour of the house.
alice, I'll see you soon.
bella,Graduation caps?
edward,A private joke. We matriculate a lot.
bella,"What a nightmare, repeating high school."
edward,... and this is my room.
bella,So you're obsessed with music. But.. .  No bed?
edward,No sleep.
bella,Ever?
edward,"No nightmares, no drool, no snoring."
edward,Do you have any favorites?
bella,"Depends. Alternative? Jazz? Sixties, seventies.. ."
edward,"Ooh, she knows her music. Alright, nineties. Eighteen-nineties. Classical."
bella,I'd have to say... Debussy.
edward,"My favorite, too."
bella,No dancing.
edward,Ever?
bella,"No tripping, no falling, no derision."
edward, I can always make you.
bella,You don't scare me.
edward,You really shouldn't have said that.
bella,Don't you dare -
esme,She's brought him to life.
esme,Alice has been wrong before.
edward,Trust me?
bella,In theory.
edward,Then close your eyes.
edward,Open.
eric,"Gambling, tuxedos and - -  Bond. James -- ow!"
charlie,"Guys, we got something -"
victoria,They took the bait.
james,By tomorrow they'll be half way to Winnipeg.
mike,"Yo, Arizona. So. You and Cullen."
bella,Sorry I'm late. Biology project.
charlie,Ordered you the seafood combo.
bella,Order one for yourself next time. You should cut back on the steak.
charlie,I'm healthy as a horse.
charlie,The suspect's moving east. Kitsap County Sheriff is taking over from here. They're putting extra guys on.
cora,Hope they catch him fast.
charlie,Your friends are flagging you.
charlie,It's okay you wanna join them. I'm just gonna turn in early anyway.
bella,"Yeah, me, too."
charlie,"It's a Friday night. Go out. The Newton boy's got a big smile for you. Nice family, the Newtons."
bella,He's just a friend.
charlie,None of the boys in town interest you?
bella,"We're not really going to talk about boys, are we?"
charlie,Just... you should be around people. I leave you alone too much.
cora,"Berry cobbler, two forks."
bella,So spring training's going well?
bella,"Actually, Forks is kind of growing on me."
rene,"(stops, knows there's"
bella, Maybe.. .
rene,Tell me everything! Jock? Indie? Bet he's smart. Is he smart?
bella, Well... he is kind of a history buff.
bella,"I, uh... have to go."
rene,"No way, we gotta talk boys. Are you being safe?"
bella,"I'll call you later, Mom."
bella,How did you get in here?
edward,The window. As always.
bella,You've been here before?
edward,What else is there to do at night?
bella,You're a peeping Tom! Perv!
edward,Shh! The Chief will hear you!
edward,I just... like watching over you.
edward,There's something I'd like to try.
bella, Oh... I'm... oh.
edward,I'm stronger than I thought.
bella,Wish I could say the same. I'm so embarrassed.
edward,Don't be. But we have to be careful.  I can never lose control with you. Ever.
charlie,He's too old for you.
bella,We're both juniors. I thought you liked the Cullens.
charlie,And I thought you weren't interested in any of the boys in town.
bella,"Edward doesn't live in town. And it's in the early stage and - - whatever, he's outside right now."
charlie,Now? He's out there?
bella,He wants to meet you. Officially.
charlie,Good.
bella,"Be nice, okay? He's... important."
edward,Chief Swan. I wanted to formally introduce myself. I'm Edward.
edward,I won't keep Bella out late tonight. We're just going to go play baseball with my family.
charlie,Bella's going to play baseball?
charlie,"Well. More power to you, I guess."
edward," She'll be safe with me, sir, I promise."
charlie, You got that pepper spray?
bella,"No fair, reading Charlie's mind."
bella,And since when do vampires like baseball?
edward,"It's the American pastime. Plus, there's a thunderstorm coming. It's the only time we can play. You'll see why."
esme,Good thing you're here. We need a umpire.
emmett, She thinks we cheat.
alice,It's time.
bella, Now I get why you need the thunder.
bella,That has to be a home run.
esme,Edward's very fast.
bella,Yer out?
alice,Stop! I didn't see them.. .
alice,They're traveling so quickly -
alice,"They did, but then they heard us.. .  And changed their minds."
edward, Put your hair down -
rosalie,Like that'll help. I could smell her from across the field.
edward,I shouldn't have brought you here. I'm so sorry.
laurent,I believe this belongs to you.
laurent,Could you use three more players?
laurent,I'm Laurent. This is Victoria. And James.
laurent,Our apologies. We didn't realize the territory had been claimed.
laurent,"Really? Well, we won't be a problem any more."
victoria,"The humans were tracking us, but we led them East-"
james,You brought a snack.
emmett, Just try it.
laurent,"Yes, I can see the game is over. We'll go now. James?"
edward,"James is a tracker. I saw his mind. The hunt is his obsession, and my reaction set him off - -"
edward,-- We're a large clan of strong fighters all protecting one vulnerable human.
edward,The first place he'll go is your house. He'll track your scent there.
bella,"I said, leave me alone!"
edward,"Bella, don't do this. Just think about it, please -"
bella,Get out! It's over.
charlie,Bella? What happened?
bella,I have to get out of this place. Out of Forks. I'm leaving. Now.
bella,"No, Dad."
charlie,Then what? Did he break up with you?
bella,I broke up with him.
charlie,I thought you liked him?
bella,That's why I have to leave. I don't want this. I want to go home.
edward, I'll be in the truck.
charlie,Your mother's not even in Phoenix.
bella,She'll come home. I'll call her from the road.
charlie,You can't drive home now. I'll take you to the airport in the morning.
bella,I want to drive. I need time to think. I'll pull into a motel in a few hours. I promise.
charlie,Bella... I just got you back.
bella,His face... I said the same words my mother used when she left him.
edward,It was the only way he'd let you go.
edward,"Your father's safe now, Bella. The tracker is following us -"
edward,It's alright. It's just Emmett. Alice is in the car behind us.
laurent,"I've grown tired of his games. But he's got unparalleled senses. Absolutely lethal. I've never seen anything like him in three hundred years ... And the woman, Victoria, will back him. Don't underestimate her."
laurent,I'm truly sorry for what's been unleashed here.
jasper,I've had to fight our kind before. We're hard to kill.
edward,But not impossible. We'll tear him up
rosalie,If he doesn't get to one of us first.
rosalie,Too late.
edward,"I'll run Bella south, while you lead the tracker away -"
alice,I'll go with Bella. Jasper and I will drive her south.
edward, Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?
edward,"Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the tracker will pick up Bella's scent."
bella,If any of you get hurt because of me -
edward,"We won't, there are five of us, two of them. When it's done, I'll come get you."
edward,You're my life now.
alice,You should eat.
bella,They could get hurt. It's not worth it.
jasper, Yes. It is.
jasper,Edward's changed since he found you. And none of us want to look into his eyes for the next hundred years if he loses you.
jasper,What do you see?
alice, The tracker. He just changed course.. .
alice,Mirrors. It's a room of mirrors.
bella,How do the visions work? Edward said they weren't always certain.
jasper,"She sees the course people are on, while they're on it. If they change their minds, the visions change."
bella,So the course James is on now will lead him to... a ballet studio?
alice, You've been here?
bella,No. I don't know. I used to take ballet lessons as a kid. The school had an arch like that.
jasper,Was your school here in Phoenix?
bella,"Yeah, around the corner from my house. But I haven't been there in ten years."
jasper,Do you have any reason to go now?
bella,"No. Hell, no. I hated the place."
edward,I'm coming to get you. (hates having to say
edward,"Bella, we're in too deep. We can't change how we feel.. ."
bella,No... we can't.  When will you get here?
edward,In a couple hours. Then you and I will go somewhere. Together. The others will keep hunting.
bella,"Mom, I'm so glad you got my - -"
bella,"Calm down, Mom. Everything is fine, okay? I'll explain every -"
bella,... Mom? Are you there?
james,I was prepared to wait for you. But then Mom came home after she received a very worried call from your Dad. It all worked out quite well.
james,"I must say, Forks High School doesn't protect its students' privacy very well. It was just too easy for Victoria to find your previous address."
bella,Leave my mother out of this.
james,You're protective of her. That's nice. You can still save her. But you'll need to get away from your friends. Can you do that?
bella,I... don't think so.
bella,Where should I meet you?
james,The old ballet studio around the corner. And I'll know if you bring anyone along. Poor mommy would pay the price for that mistake.
bella," 8th and Palo Verde, please."
bella,Everyone makes fun of me.
rene,But you're a wonderful dancer.
bella,"Mom, I suck."
james,"That's my favorite part. Stubborn child, weren't you?"
bella,She's not here.
james,Sorry. But you really made it too easy.
james,"So to make things more entertaining, I'm going to make a little film of our time together. Borrowed this from your house. Hope you don't mind."
james,Excellent! An escape attempt.
james,It'll break Edward's little heart.
bella,Edward has nothing to do with this.
james,Beautiful! Very visually dynamic. I chose my stage well.
james,"Still stubborn, aren't you? Is that what makes you special? Because frankly, I don't see it."
james,"Too bad he didn't have the strength to turn you. Instead, he kept you this fragile little human. It's cruel, really."
james,Well done! You've succeeded in annoying me.
james,Tell Edward how much it hurts.
james,Tell him to avenge you.
bella,"No! Edward, don't.. ."
james,Cut! The end.
james,You're alone... because you're faster than the others. But not stronger.
edward,I'm strong enough to kill you.
bella,It's on fire! My hand!
edward,Venom - -
edward,No!
alice,It's going to happen. I've seen it -
edward,It doesn't have to be that way.
bella,It's burning!
edward,What's the other choice? You said -
edward,I -- won't be able to stop -
edward,"It's alright, Bella. I'll make it go away."
rene,He never leaves. And your dad's down in the cafeteria.
bella,What... happened?
rene,"Baby, you fell down two flights of stairs and through a window."
rene,It's Phil. He's worried about you.
bella,"Mom, you're... texting."
bella,That's great mom.
rene,Jacksonville is always sunny and you'll have your own bathroom.. .
bella,"Mom, wait. I want to live in Forks. I have Dad.. ."
rene, And he's there.
rene,Charlie doesn't like him. Blames him for your leaving.
bella,What do you think?
bella,"Um, Mom, would you mind getting Dad? I want to talk to him. Apologize."
rene,"I'm sure he doesn't care about that, Baby. But Ill go get him."
bella,Is James - did you -- ?
edward,"We took care of him. And the woman, Victoria, she ran off."
bella,I'm alive because of you.
edward, You're in here because of me.
edward,The worst of it... was thinking I couldn't stop -
bella,But you did.
edward,"Bella, you should go to Jacksonville. Where I can't hurt you anymore.. ."
bella,What? No! I want to be with you! I don't want -
charlie,Heard that before.
charlie,... and... you look beautiful.
edward,Prom is an important rite of passage. I don't want you to miss anything.
edward,Shall we?
bella, You're serious.
edward,See? You're dancing.
bella,At prom.
bella,I want you. Always.
edward, I won't end your life for you.
bella,"I'm dying anyway. Every minute, I get closer, older"
edward,That's how it's supposed to happen.
bella,Not the way Alice saw it.  I heard her. She saw me like you.
edward,"Her visions change, Bella."
bella,Based on what someone decides. And I've decided.
edward,Is that what you dream about? Becoming a monster?
bella,I dream about being with you forever.
edward,You really want this?
bella,Yes.
bella,Yes.
edward,You're going to have a long and happy life with me. Isn't that enough?
bella,For now.
