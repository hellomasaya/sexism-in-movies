Speaker,Dialogue
hanna,I just missed your heart. She stands and pulls out an old pistol from her waist holster. She fires two shots directly at CAMERA.
erik,"You're dead. Right now. I've killed you. HANNA spins spraying deer-blood on to the snow and brings her fist right to ERIK's face. He blocks and thumps an open palm on to HANNA's shoulder sending her sprawling into the snow. She leaps to her feet, as ERIK aims a kick at her head. She dodges, punches below his knee cap, and goes for her pistol. ERIK slaps the hand away."
erik,What's wrong? Are you hurt? She keeps swirling her spoon.
hanna,I'll do better next time.
erik,German.
hanna,(In German w/ English
erik,Italian.
hanna,(In Italian w/ English
erik,Spanish. HANNA studies her food and slowly takes a spoonful.
hanna,(In Spanish w/ English
erik,How much did you pull off the deer?
hanna,A hundred and twenty with scraps.
erik,About 200 pounds in total? HANNA nods.
hanna,What?
erik,How you beat me. You're getting strong. HANNA almost blushes. ERIK stands to put his bowl away.
erik,The Great Blue Whale is the largest animal to have ever existed. A blue whale's tongue weighs over two and a half tons and its mouth is large enough to hold 90 tons of food and water.
hanna,How much is that?
erik,It's bigger than the cabin. Its heart weighs thirteen hundred pounds and a male has seven gallons of testicles. HANNA smirks.
hanna,Good night. He stands by her bed looking down at her.
erik,Did you forget something?
hanna,No. ERIK takes HANNA'S gun out of his pocket and puts it on the table next to her bed.
erik,Good night. He walks to the door. HANNA stops him with a question.
hanna,What's music like?
erik,It's difficult to explain.
hanna,"Try. He opens the encyclopedia again, leafs through the pages and reads."
hanna,But how does it feel? Erik is not equipped to answer such esoteric questions.
erik,"Good. It feels good. It's, uh, nice."
hanna,Tell me properly. Can you play music?
erik,Your mother could. She used to sing very well.
hanna,I'd like to hear it for myself.
erik,You will soon enough.
hanna,How soon? Erik looks away from her questioning eyes.
erik,When you're ready.
hanna,I'm ready. I'm ready already. They look at each other- he weighs it up.
erik,Just go to sleep now. I'll see you in the morning.
erik,Again. They reset. She repeats the motion. Hand. Knee. Elbow. Fist.
hanna,"I live in Leipzig. German city. Population 0.7 Million people. We live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I go to school at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium and my best friends are Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I like literature and sport, in particular tennis and athletics. I have a dog called Trudi."
erik,Don't give up! Don't give up! HANNA's arms flails as she fights against the stream and she screams in pain. She is grabbed under by the undertow and is pulled downwards. For a second she is underwater and in darkness but ERIK's hand pulls her back up and she breaks the surface with a gasp of relief.
hanna,I didn't need your help.
hanna,I'm ready now.
erik,"Maybe. ERIK relaxes. It's a false beat. He lunges again at her, really violently. He seems to be really trying to hurt her. But HANNA has reached under her mattress and there is a flint knife - in an instant it is at ERIK's neck. She pricks his neck slightly. It bleeds just slightly. Stillness and silence. HANNA breathless, angry."
hanna,You told me to think for myself. Isn't that what you want? She is angry for the first time. ERIK does not answer. Just stares at her.
erik,"One, two, three, four..."
erik,"...nine, ten. After 10 paces, ERIK makes a 90 degree turn and enters the tree line. The snow and mud crunch under his boots. We continue to inter-cut the following with more close-ups of HANNA training: climbing, fighting, chin-ups, shooting. All the while we continue to hear ERIK counting out his paces. After 40 paces, with the cabin light distant, ERIK falls to his knees. He unsheathes a large knife and jams it into the frozen earth."
hanna,"Hello little foxy... foxy loxy... come on... come and share my breakfast. The fox comes to her and nervously accepts the scrap, withdrawing a few feet to eat it. HANNA shuffles forward carefully and gently pats the snow fox - it is only a cub."
hanna,"Did you see it? Wasn't it beautiful, like thunder. I had to stick my fingers in my ears it was so loud. Did you hear it? She stops, sensing ERIK'S mood."
erik,"It tells Marissa Wiegler where we are. He looks at her, a hint of a challenge."
hanna,"You're not scaring me. He looks at her disbelievingly. She shakes her head in protest, but simultaneously moves away from the switch. He softens towards her."
erik,"It's here. There's no rush. Take your time. HANNA turns her back on the box, but can't help taking another look at it over her shoulder."
erik,"Laika, a mongrel dog from the streets of Moscow, was the first animal to orbit the Earth. She was launched into outer space on the third of November, 1957. Scientists believed humans would be unable to survive conditions of outer space, so flights by animals were viewed as an experimental precursor to human missions. Her rocket was not designed to be retrievable, and Laika had always been intended to die."
hanna,That's sad. ERIK awkwardly turns the page to change subject.
erik,When a star collapses the supernova explosion is 10 billion times brighter than other stars. HANNA shuts her eyes and tries to imagine how bright that might be.
erik,Will you hunt with me? Hanna is sweeping the ground.
hanna,If you want.
erik,It's up to you.
hanna,Me?
erik,"Yes. HANNA eyes the box sitting open, it's waiting for her."
hanna,I'll stay.
erik,"Fine. ERIK leaves abruptly. HANNA continues to sweep the ground, her movements bring her closer to the metal box. She stops sweeping and looks at the box. She turns and walks out of the cabin."
hanna, Marissa Wiegler.
erik,You were lucky to grab that deer. There was nothing out there today. ERIK looks over at the meal HANNA is preparing.
tech one,Ma'am. We've had a signal reported by Interpol. We think it's Eric Heller. An unusual expression of shock on MARISSA'S face.
marissa,Well I'll be.
tech one,It seems he's in Sweden. Jokkmokk. 40 miles out.
marissa,What the fuck is he doing there?
tech one,"Living in the middle of nowhere, like the frigging Una Bomber."
marissa,The son of a bitch. Sweden? Sweden?! The PA hands her a coffee and she hands him some files.
tech one,Apparently he turned on his locator.
marissa,He's not an idiot.
tech one,I know... I mean I believe so. But that's what happened.
marissa,"After 14 years in Jokkmokk, maybe he'd rather go to prison."
marissa,Trouble was he had his own way of doing things. Kinda paranoid. WALT fires up a computer screen and logs on. He uses an access code. This takes him to a new file. He enters the tracking device number. A name comes up. ERIK HELLER. He clicks on a link. HELLER's face pops on to the screen.
bob,Anybody know why?
marissa,Bring him in.
walt,"What do you mean? Call the police,"
marissa,"- Walt. This is exactly the kind of shit we can't have out there anymore. He was one of ours, we trained him. He kills some other poor woman and it's a cluster fuck."
walt,Tell it to Interpol. Let them pick him up. Try him for murder.
bob,He's right. This has nothing to do with us. I don't understand.
marissa,You don't have to. I'm making the call. BOB and WALT exchange a look.
erik,"Hanna... HANNA looks up, still trying to hide her fear."
hanna,Marissa Weigler.
erik,Then?
hanna,Postcard.
erik,Then?
hanna,What?
erik,The address where we meet.
hanna,"Wilhelm Grimm's house. Stephanstrasse 260. 10559, Berlin. Germany. ERIK moves a strand of hair from HANNA'S forehead and looks at her with paternal care."
erik,Good night my sweet girl. He stands and quietly goes to the door when her voice stops him.
hanna,"Father... He turns to look at her, both their eyes full of trepidation."
erik,You can do this. You're ready. Just remember what I've taught you. She smiles reassuringly at him.
hanna,I'll see you there.
special ops,Is this guy one of ours?
marissa,What is it?
marissa,Go ahead.
marissa,How did that happen?
lewis,"Ma'am. There's more. They found a child, his daughter. MARISSA turns pale."
voice 1,She hasn't moved since we brought her in.
voice 1,They want a psych evaluation before they interrogate.
burton,Hello Hanna. Hanna lies motionless.
hanna,I was told by my father to gain the upper hand.
burton,Really. Interesting. What else did your father tell you?
hanna,Where am I?
burton,You're in holding.
hanna,I see.
burton,This must all be very strange for you. You've been in the forest a long time. But I want you to know no one's going to hurt you. We just want to talk to you about your father. HANNA seems to be staring up at the ceiling.
hanna,Is that a camera?
burton,"Ah, yes, that's a camera. To keep a record."
hanna,"Camera obscura, it's Latin for ""dark chamber""."
lewis,Plug the CCTV through to Langley. Extension 247. MONITOR presses some buttons as LEWIS calls on his phone and speaks into it.
hanna,It was first described by the Arabic scientist Ibn Alhazen in the
marissa,What's she saying?
burton,Can I get you something? What do you like? Music? Magazines? Just say. Anything at all.
hanna,I want to speak to Marissa Wiegler.
marissa,Tell her I'll be there tonight.
lewis,But...
marissa,Just do it.
lewis,You should have visual.
false marissa,You're in a safe place. Let's talk about your father. You must love him very much.
hanna,Where did you meet him? The false MARISSA pauses.
marissa,"Tell her it was by a news kiosk in Alexanderplatz, East Berlin. Say it was raining."
false marissa,"At a news kiosk. Alexanderplatz. In the rain. She smiles reassuringly. HANNA nods, looking at FALSE"
lewis,Lewis.
military doctor,"Sir we need to talk to you. We've run tests on the girl. His voice sounds urgent, concerned. But Marissa has interrupted."
false marissa,"Do you know where your father is? In the OBS room LEWIS, half watching the screen, explains to MARISSA on intercom."
lewis,Standard DNA and meds.
marissa,Send the results straight to me. On the screen FALSE MARISSA is talking to HANNA.
false marissa,"Did he tell you where he was going? We're all worried about him. On the CCTV Hanna looks at the FALSE MARISSA. She begins to cry, holds out her arms to be held."
monitor,Sir look. LEWIS looks at HANNA.
false marissa,"It's OK. It's OK. HANNA coils her thin arms around the FALSE MARISSA'S neck, clinging to her like a monkey. The FALSE MARISSA looks up to the security camera, slightly concerned. Hanna wriggles in her arms, to get a better grip..."
false marissa,I think it might be necessary.
marissa,Get her out of there.
burton,Open up. The first guard opens HANNA'S door.
lewis,Jee-sus wept! On another screen LEWIS watches as the other Guard tries to drag the metal door shut. He hits a fleshy door jam - Burton. Hanna is upon him. Two shots.
lewis,She's a child for Christsake!
female guard,"This is Sanders. I'm checking Zone eleven. The FEMALE GUARD radios off, then enters. She senses something. POV SANDERS - The DNA laboratory suddenly seems empty. The buzz of the lab's lighting and the whir of the air- pressurizes are the only sounds as the GUARD looks around. Then the GUARD hears a rustling from behind her and tenses up. She turns around but HANNA has vanished into thin air, there is silence."
monitor,You think she's out?
lewis,She can't get out. LEWIS picks up an internal telephone.
military voice,Can you confirm your position 473? Banks? Banks can you hear me?
sophie,"Hello. HANNA stares at her, then abruptly turns to walk in opposite direction until she sees another convoy of US military trucks in the distance."
miles,Who's she?
sophie,I don't know. I just found her.
miles,What's her name?
sophie,She can't talk.
hanna,Hanna.
miles,She talked.
hanna,"I live in Leipzig. German city. Population 0.7 Million people. We live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz. I go to school at the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium and my best friends are Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess. I like literature and sport, in particular tennis and athletics."
hanna,I also have a dog called Trudi.
miles,"We had a dog called Vincent, but he went mad and died."
sophie,"I'm Sophie and this is my brother, Shit for Brains. From over the dune comes the voice of SOPHIE and MILES'S mother, RACHEL LYALL."
miles,Bye.
sophie,"See you. SOPHIE takes one more puzzled look at HANNA, then turns and disappears over the sand dune. HANNA rises to the top of the dune. SOPHIE turns back to"
hanna,No. I prefer to walk.
sophie,Suit yourself.
marissa,Have you got the DNA results?
lewis,We can't find them. It's possible she has them on her. Marissa takes that in.
marissa,Okay. I want you to focus on Erik Heller.
air steward,"Excuse Madame, airline regulations state that -"
marissa,I'm in conference.
air steward,All the same -
marissa,"Back off, honey. I'm busy. MARISSA'S response is so fierce that the AIR STEWARD instinctively does as he's told."
marissa,I'm dealing with it Lewis.
hotel owner,Where's your family?
hanna,Are you Arab?
hotel owner,I'm Moroccan.
hanna,Morocco. Capital city Rabat. Places of interest. Marrakesh. Essouaira. Religion Islam. Language Arabic (in Arabic w/ English
hotel owner,(in Arabic w/ English
hanna,(in Arabic w/ English
hotel owner,(in Arabic w/ English
hanna,(in Arabic w/ English
hotel owner,It's the best we've got.
hanna,Thank you. HANNA stares at the light switch.
hotel owner,Of course. All mod cons.
hanna,It's electricity? The HOTEL OWNER looks at HANNA askance.
hotel owner,Yes.
hanna,"I know a little bit about electricity. They say Edison discovered it, or was it Franklin?"
hotel owner,"Some American, I'm sure. He picks up an electric kettle."
hanna,What is it?
hotel owner,"It's the best we can do. She stares at the picture, bemused."
hanna,"The forest. The HOTEL OWNER smiles, himself a little puzzled by this strange encounter, and leaves. She just sits there staring at the TV as it's volume seems to increase. Meanwhile the electric kettle begins to boil. Steam pours from its spout and the whole contraption starts to rattle violently."
miles,Look. It's that girl. He nudges SOPHIE. HANNA eyes them suspiciously.
sophie,Hey you made it.
miles,"Hey, again."
sophie,Did you walk here?
miles,She looks different.
sophie,Do you want to hang with us?
miles,Are you hungry?
sophie,Miles is always hungry.
hanna,I'm thirsty.
marissa,"I don't want any bad news Lewis. Neither of us can afford a fuck up. MARISSA hangs up. She enters a converted car park which is now a lap dancing bar. It's early in the day and the patrons are as scarce as the clothes on the dancers. At the far end of the room is the reason Marissa is there, MICHAEL ISAACS. Mid fifties. Rumpled suit, bleary, unshaven and drinking a scotch. ISAACS smiles coldly at MARISSA."
isaacs,I didn't think they let women in here.
marissa,"They let them in, they just don't let them get dressed. He smiles, drinks, she eyes the scotch."
isaacs,You have.
marissa,Adapt or die.
isaacs,You want a drink?
marissa,"I'll wait until I really need one. He grins and drinks. She sits, with a sigh, looks him in the eye."
isaacs,You don't say.
marissa,"There's more. MARISSA passes him a newspaper. He opens it. Hidden inside is a picture of Hanna. He looks it over, surprised."
marissa,He did a good job.
isaacs,Did she turn out like you hoped?
marissa,She just tried to kill me.
isaacs,Isn't it always the way?
marissa,The fuck does that mean?
isaacs,"You bring them into this world, teach them how to kill and maim... and then they turn against you."
marissa,I didn't teach her.
isaacs,"No, it's better than that. You bred her from a test tube. MARISSA turns to the BARMAN and signals for a round of the scotches, Two of these..."
marissa,Here's the problem: She thinks we killed her mother. He smiles wryly.
isaacs,Just get her sectioned or something.
marissa,"Sure, just as soon as she's done breaking peoples necks. You get her sectioned, if you can catch her. The drinks arrive, MARISSA drinks."
isaacs,I'll need funds. MARISSA slides an envelope of bills across the table.
marissa,"Don't spend it all on candy. She glances meaningfully at the STRIPPERS, who have been eyeing up ISAACS as a potential mark. ISAACS looks at the money. When he looks back up MARISSA is already walking out the door."
sophie,She's beautiful. I wish I had a body like hers. She's really cool too. She's married to a footballer and really loves him -
rachel,"Perhaps Hanna doesn't want a make- over, sweetie. SOPHIE ignores RACHEL and addresses all her responses to"
sophie,Rachel doesn't believe in making the best of yourself.
rachel,"No Sophie, I just don't believe fourteen year-old girls should be dressing to look like porn stars. It objectifies them."
hanna,I don't think so.
rachel,Good. Keep it that way.
sophie,That's SOOO gross.
rachel,"Do you often travel on your own, Hanna?"
hanna,My father encourages me to be independent.
seb,And your mother?
hanna,She's dead.
seb,"Oh, I'm sorry."
sophie,"Nice one, Dad."
hanna,People die.
miles,What did she die of?
hanna,Three bullets.
rachel,Oh. God. How terrible. SOPHIE is weirdly impressed.
heller,Three pounds of goose fat if you please.
sophie,Why do we always have to get up so early?
seb,If you were a Berber shepherd -
sophie,- I'm not a shepherd. Jesus.
rachel,We have to be at the port by eight tomorrow so I want you to pack now...
miles,"I'm too sleepy. HANNA listens anxiously, knowing she needs to go with them to be safe. She arrives at her door."
hanna,Good night. But the family are too wrapped up in their discussion to notice her.
seb,"No, you're not. Come on we'll do it together. HANNA enters her room. SOPHIE turns at the sound of HANNA'S door closing."
sophie,"She's weird. Is it me, or is that girl weird?"
result,HANNA stares at the words. Interfering sequence present. Abnormal. HANNA looks at the photo of herself and those words.
abnormal,What does it mean? She looks up at the TV and sees footage of millions of Muslim worshipers circling the Kaaba at Mecca. The sheer mass of humanity stuns her. HANNA turns up the volume and hears the call to prayer. She listens in wonder to her first experience of music.
seb,... Somebody broke the sun roof. I said somebody broke the sun roof. It won't close...
rachel,Call the rental.
seb,I hope its insured.
seb,Typical. Get me back to the European Union.
rachel,"Don't be rude. They get out, taking with them anything they might need - knapsacks, computer games, suit cases. They head off towards the stairs up to the decks, passing ISAACS on their way. ISAACS searches between the cars and trucks. He passes the back of the FAMILY'S van as the camera pushes in on its back door. The handle is being JIGGLED FROM INSIDE."
rachel,"What has got into you? Oh my God, look over there. They all look where she is pointing - at HANNA."
sophie,It's her.
seb,"You think she... you don't think she... Rachel, the sunroof?"
rachel,You think we should say something?
seb,What's there to say?
rachel,Maybe she's in trouble.
seb,Maybe she's a hooker. Or a terrorist. There's a lot of them in Germany.
sophie,Hookers or terrorists?
rachel,I'll go over.
seb,"Rachel, walk away. I'm insisting here. I'm putting my foot down... RACHEL heads off towards HANNA, SOPHIE follows."
sophie,All right?
hanna,Did you know that 71 percent of the earths surface is covered in water?
sophie,"My father thinks you're a stowaway. He thinks you broke our sunroof too, which puts you in deep shit."
rachel,Sophie just - I'll handle this.
sophie,Are you okay?
hanna,I'm fine.
rachel,I'm worried about you.
sophie,She said she's fine.
rachel,You have to understand this really is a problem for us.
sophie,You know what? Why don't I stay here with her and you go off and be with dad? He's looking kind of tense.
seb,Has she even got a passport?!
rachel,I don't think I handled that very well.
seb,How do you know she's not some kind of illegal immigrant?
sophie,Would you like some? HANNA looks curiously at the ice-cream.
hanna,Please. She tries it.
sophie,"You're so weird, aren't you? Did you have a fight with your dad or something?"
hanna,Yes.
sophie,Was it bad?
hanna,No. I won. HANNA studies the sea.
sophie,You're pretty. You know that?
hanna,Am I?
sophie,Of course you are. You've got pretty eyes and you're tall. I always wanted to be tall. If I were a man I might fancy you. She laughs. HANNA responds seriously.
hanna,"I'm not a man. SOPHIE laughs even more. The door swings open and SEB is standing there with RACHEL, nervous but determined."
seb,"Okay, here's the deal. We're going to find a way to get you home just as soon as we get off this crate. But since you don't have a passport with you right now, we're just going to have to be a bit gorilla. Okay?"
rachel,"We passionately believe it's the right thing to do. They don't look sure at all, but SOPHIE puts her arm round HANNA and HANNA returns the gesture, everybody slightly embarrassed."
rachel,You okay honey?
hanna,"Yes yes I'm ready! ISAACS is getting closer, walking between the cars. The ferry gates are open and the noise subsides. SEB discovers the crowbar, examines it."
seb,"Oh Jesus. HANNA grabs it and sticks it back in the box, helps SEB fling cushions aside and gets into the compartment."
isaacs,"Sir, I'll be as brief as I can, we have a situation here..."
lewis,The Danish authorities are taking this very seriously. They've doubled the number of officers on the ground. We've sent up spotter planes over the channel.
marissa,Keep me posted.
hanna,Guten Morgen.
hanna,Gutm und Ihnen?
hanna,Ca va. Oui. Bien... HANNA starts efficiently helping SEB erect the children's tent. He's watches impressed as HANNA expertly ties complicated knots. RACHEL and MILES start blowing up two inflatable mattresses.
rachel,Maybe we could all go for a walk when we've put the tent up.
sophie,No thanks. HANNA looks off to the tree line. In the distance she spots a couple of RABBITS in a pool of sunlight.
rachel,"I just feel connected when I'm in the countryside. The city stifles me... emotionally, creatively. HANNA'S attention is elsewhere, she's spotted something in the undergrowth."
sophie,"It's probably just a bunch of Spanish farmers, mum. We're hardly going to be out all night."
rachel,"You're not going, Sophie. No way, Jose. HANNA appears from the woods carrying TWO SKINNED RABBITS. She lays them in front of the family."
hanna,"Food. SOPHIE lets out a shriek of nervous laughter, while SEB and RACHEL are confused as to what the appropriate reaction might be."
miles,That's gross.
sophie,"I don't know why I'm doing this, you're going to steal all the best men off of me."
hanna,What do you mean?
sophie,"Though quite frankly I don't need more digits than I've got right now. Loads. Loads and loads. HANNA watches herself in the mirror. Mascara, eye liner. She licks the lipstick, puzzled. Almost a woman, but it doesn't look right on her."
hanna,It's like paint.
sophie,"Don't lick it off. SOPHIE finishes HANNA's face, looks at her in the mirror."
hanna,I can't walk in this.
sophie,You look hot.
hanna,Where are we going?
sophie,Shhhhh! HANNA uncomfortable with the situation.
hanna,I shouldn't take unnecessary risks.
sophie,Says who? SOPHIE heads off down the road. HANNA weighs the situation and then quickens her pace to catch up with SOPHIE.
sophie,Vodka. Two.
bartender,"Water only. No booze. Meanwhile HANNA spots FELICIANO, the handsome SPANISH BOY from the camp site shop, across the dance floor. He is staring at her again. SOPHIE comes back with two bottles of water and hands one to"
hanna,What do they call this music?
sophie,"Banging. HANNA stares at the dancers, people losing themselves in it - SOPHIE just grins, starts to move to the music. HANNA smiles awkwardly, tries to copy SOPHIE."
isaacs,What you got?
dealer,(in Spanish w/ English
isaacs,Ssh.
spanish boy,(in Spanish w/ English
hanna,Will you teach me to do dancing?
sophie,"It's easy. HANNA and SOPHIE walk onto the dance floor and begin to dance. HANNA starts by dancing like a five year-old, swinging her arms jerkily and lifting her feet as if walking through a field. But soon her movements become more sophisticated and expressive."
hanna,How can you tell?
sophie,"Duh, look at the way he's looking at you. He's gorgeous. FELICIANO'S FRIEND approaches SOPHIE, he's not bad looking either."
feliciano's friend,What's your name?
sophie,Sophie.
feliciano's friend,Have you come here before?
sophie,All the time.
feliciano's friend,Really? You dance well.
sophie,"So do you. HANNA and FELICIANO hold eye contact. The music rises and now they're lit only by the intermittent flashes of a strobe light. HANNA and FELICIANO begin to dance around each other, their movements caught in still flashes."
hanna,Are we going to kiss now?
feliciano,Would you like to?
hanna,Kissing requires a total of thirty- four facial muscles. Their lips are almost touching.
sophie,Hanna! Holy crap...
feliciano,"Please, don't hurt me."
hanna,Should I let him go?
sophie,"As opposed to what? Yes, you should let him go. HANNA leans in to whisper into FELICIANO'S ear."
hanna,I'm going to go now.
feliciano,Sure.
hanna,"It was nice. And she's gone, pulling SOPHIE away through the crowd. ISAACS jumps into action. But he's lost sight of the girls among the mass of dancing bodies. HANNA and SOPHIE move quickly through the crowds towards the exit."
sophie,"Oh, my God, Hanna. I thought you were going to kill him. Where d'you learn to do that?"
hanna,My father taught me. They escape through a hole in the perimeter fence.
night,"An immaculately tidy lounge in a small apartment on the ground floor of a run down East Berlin housing project. A well-dressed woman in her 60's, KATRIN, is sitting alone listening to music on an old casette machine. The door buzzer rings. KATRIN gets up slowly and approaches the door."
katrin,Who is it? No reply. KATRIN puts the safety chain across the door and opens it a small amount.
marissa,"Hello Katrin. KATRIN slams the door shut in fright and double locks it. Fear racing through her veins, she rushes her way through the lounge, knocking furniture as she goes."
katrin,You look different in pictures.
marissa,Well here I am in the flesh. KATRIN'S mouth twitches with all the imagined conversations she's had with MARISSA.
katrin,Erik's dead. MARISSA sits calmly in an old arm chair.
marissa,"Huh, if only."
katrin,If he's alive why would he contact me?
marissa,"That depends on whether you believe he's innocent, or not."
katrin,I'm an old woman with a broken
marissa,"- What's in the past, stays in the past, right?"
katrin,Something like that.
marissa,So why all the years of snooping around and sticking your nose in?
katrin,You'd understand if you had kids. She turns her back on MARISSA.
marissa,"Kid's, they fuck you up, don't they?"
sophie,Can't you sleep?
hanna,No.
sophie,Me neither. SOPHIE pauses. Looks at her.
hanna,Yes?
sophie,Where do you really come from?
hanna,"Leipzig, I live in Leipzig - SOPHIE looses her patience."
sophie,If we're going to be friends you have to be honest with me. Them's the rules. HANNA is taken aback.
hanna,Are we friends?
sophie,Yes. I like you.
hanna,I'd like to have a friend.
sophie,"I mean you're a freak and everything, but I like you."
hanna,I like you too. I really do. But there are things I can't tell you. Do you understand?
sophie,"Yes... Actually, no, I don't."
hanna,There are people that want to harm me. Bad people.
sophie,I see.
hanna,And they wont stop.
sophie,Right.
hanna,So for your own safety... HANNA looks into SOPHIE'S eyes.
sophie,"I don't know. I mean, I don't really know who you are. Do I?"
hanna,That's just it. Neither do I. She reaches into her bag. Brings out the DNA report. Shows it to Sophie. They read. Interfering Sequence. Abnormal.
sophie,What is it?
hanna,I think it's about me. DNA is kind of how we're made I think. I mean who we are. They look at it.
sophie,What will you do?
hanna,I'm going to Berlin. I have to meet my father at the house of Wilhelm Grimm.
sophie,As in Grimm's Fairytales?
hanna,That's right. SOPHIE sighs at HANNA.
sophie,If you say so.
hanna,"Did I say the wrong thing again? SOPHIE looks at HANNA, sees she's vulnerable. She takes a bracelet off her own wrist. Gives it to her."
sophie,"Keep this. To remember me. HANNA takes it, puts it on. Moved. Looks at SOPHIE."
hanna,"Thank you. HANNA stares at the ceiling, looks over at SOPHIE who's starting to sleep. HANNA reaches out and touches her hair. Beside them, separated by a thin piece of fabric, we see that MILES has woken and has been listening in the darkness."
receptionist,Yes of course.
erik,I stayed here fifteen years ago. It hasn't changed.
receptionist,We don't much like change here.
erik,Neither do I.
receptionist,Name?
erik,Olsson. Peter Olsson.
receptionist,You have some post. She turns and retrieves HANNA'S POSTCARD from the mail rack and hands it to him.
erik,Thank you. ERIK reads: Mission accomplished
receptionist,Have you heard about the manhunt? A man has killed two coastguards. Everybody is being asked to keep an eye out.
erik,For what exactly?
receptionist,I don't know. He smiles. She takes a closer look and notices goose fat smeared behind his ear.. and blood on a shirt cuff...
hanna,How long until you drop me off?
rachel,We should have you there by dinner time. From Lille you can get a train to Berlin. Leipzig's just a few hours further. HANNA and SOPHIE exchange a look.
isaacs,Wake up. It's them. He jumps in the passenger seat whilst the driver revs the engine. The BMW pulls out in front of an oncoming truck narrowly avoiding a collision.
isaacs,Keep your distance.
receptionist,"Is that the police? Yes, I don't want to trouble you but I have a new guest you may wish to know about."
hanna,"...they can live at freezing temperatures for up to nine months without food. Imagine that, nine months."
rachel,Why do you know so much about fleas?
hanna,"I read it in my Encyclopaedia. HANNA is looking in the side view mirror. She sees ISAACS BMW and frowns, she's seen it before."
rachel,Everything all right?
hanna,I think so. But HANNA'S face betrays her concern.
marissa,What?
receptionist,"Frau Wiegler, this is reception. I have one Erik Heller for you. MARISSA stops dead."
marissa,Put him on.
marissa,So were you.
erik,"Well, here we are."
marissa,How did you know I was here?
erik,I killed one of your men. Got his cellphone. You've gotten soft.
erik,You got kids?
marissa,"No, I made choices."
erik,"Hanna's practically yours, you know? This goes straight to an ache that's been building in"
marissa,Not interested. But she is.
erik,"She's true and good and funny. Yeah, she's funny. She's special. You should see her."
marissa,I'm looking forward to it.
erik,You'll have to catch her first. The line goes dead. MARISSA puts the phone down and sits quietly for a moment. Then presses play again on the tape machine.
rachel,"Shit. Shit, shit, shit. I think we're lost, Hanna. HANNA checks the side view mirror again and sees ISAACS BMW. She's knows that whoever is driving that car is after her. She looks back and sees SEB, SOPHIE and MILES all comfortably asleep. MILES' fingers wrapped around a Transformers toy."
hanna,"No, don't."
rachel,I need to check the map.
rachel,"Why won't that car pass? He has his lights on high beam, I was doing everything I could to get out of the way... SOPHIE wakes up in the back."
sophie,Are we stopped? I need to pee.
rachel,"Well, I don't want you going too far right now."
hanna,"I think you should stay where you are, Sophie. HANNA doesn't take her eyes off the mirror. She can see the silhouettes of ISAACS and his MEN. They don't move and neither does HANNA. Both are waiting for the other to make the first move."
rachel,"Hanna, what's going on. Seb wake up."
hanna,Please.
sophie,This is creepy. You're creeping me out.
hanna,I'm sorry. But you really mustn't get out of the van. HANNA climbs into the back of the van and comes very close to
sophie,I promise.
rachel,"Hanna, tell me what's going on or Seb will go over to that car and find out."
seb,Like fuck I will. Everyone stay put. Where's my phone?
rachel,Hanna! RACHEL sees ISAACS and one of the HENCHMEN chase after HANNA. The SECOND HENCHMAN appears at her drivers window aiming his gun at her head. RACHEL screams.
marissa,Would you please stop crying?
sophie,I'm not telling you anything.
marissa,"Honey, your friend is in a lot of danger. You need to help us find her."
sophie,"I don't know where to find her! MARISSA grits her teeth, shows SOPHIE a photo of FELICIANO."
marissa,Do you know him?
sophie,No.
marissa,He knows you.
rachel,We gave her a ride because we thought she was in trouble.
marissa,But you knew she didn't have a passport. You smuggled her into port and helped her illegally gain
rachel,She said she lived in Leipzig. She went to the Klaus Kohle Gymnasium.
marissa,There is no Klaus Kohle Gymnasium. It closed five years ago. Shock on Rachel's face.
rachel,"She said she was going home, to Leipzig. She seemed lost. Like she needed taking care of.  You understand. MARISSA shows her the photograph of JOANNA ZADEK."
marissa,"This was Hanna's mother, Joanna Zadek. Fifteen years ago Hanna's father shot her to death on a camping holiday by the Baltic. RACHEL swallows, goes pale."
seb,"She was odd. I'll give you that. Disconnected. I mean I get on with most kids, you know, have a rapport. But, this one -"
marissa,"You know, Mr Lyall, it's days like these that I really hate my job."
seb,I'm sure you do.
marissa,"It's a very, very difficult thing to do."
seb,Absolutely.
marissa,But sometimes children are bad people too.
seb,"Hey what's going on in there? We don't have to put up with this! We're in the EU, Goddammit!"
marissa,Three days ago Hanna's father killed two Danish policemen on a beach with a hunting knife.
seb,Where is he now?
marissa,He's still at large and he's still very dangerous. We need to find Hanna before he does. Pause. SOPHIE thinks about it but clams up. Marissa notices.
rachel,Sophie? Still nothing. They all look at her. MILES suddenly speaks.
miles,She's going to Berlin. To Wilhelm Grimm's house.
rachel,How did you know that?
sophie,You fuckwad! SOPHIE slaps MILES over the back of the head but SEB pushes her back.
seb,Hey hey hey! Sophie for God's sake.
isaacs,I've looked through Heller's contacts from the 1980's. There's no one called Wilhelm.
marissa,"Wilhelm Grimm wrote fairy-tales. He died two hundred years ago. MARISSA hands ISAACS a brown envelope containing one of the photographs she took from KATRIN'S apartment. The photograph shows a happy looking JOANNA and ERIK at a busy family amusement park. Between ERIK and JOANNA is a clown, his arms around both of them. This we will come to understand is KLAUS KNEPFLER. Behind them is a GRIMM'S"
isaacs,What the hell is this? MARISSA smiles slightly.
marissa,Wilhelm's house.  Drive on.
knepfler,"Excuse me young lady? It is the man from the photo, but twenty years older. Small, with a wiry intensity."
hanna,Are you Wilhelm Grimm?
knepfler,"Not exactly, but it'll do for now. Come this way. He leads her inside."
knepfler,So you are Hanna. He puts out his hand to shake.
hanna,What happened to it?
knepfler,"No car park. You need a car park these days, otherwise people wont come. But somebody has to watch over it..."
hanna,It's beautiful.
knepfler,I like it too. Erik used to come here a great deal.
hanna,Have you heard from him? He nods.
knepfler,"You must wait. He will be here soon. HANNA stares, not quite believing."
knepfler,"Please, sit down. HANNA sits at the old kitchen table on a wooden bench, while KNEPFLER goes to the stove."
hanna,"Please. HANNA takes an egg, breaks it and swallows it raw. KNEPFLER smiles. He gives her a buff envelope. She looks inside - some money, a passport, ID cards."
knepfler,"You'll need a fresh photograph. Don't get it wet. HANNA looks at the passport with a new name - ANNA-MARIE ELKAN. She takes a deep breath, not really comprehending."
hanna,I don't really understand.
knepfler,ID. Identity. It tells people who you are. She stares at the passport with the blank space for her photo.
hanna,Do I have to?
knepfler,Don't you want to?
hanna,I don't know. I miss the forest. I miss my home.
knepfler,"That's to be expected. But the city is so exciting, don't you think?"
hanna,"I suppose. She drinks her water, thinking."
knepfler,I did.
hanna,What was she like?
knepfler,"She was very gentle, she was very funny, very talented - a singer - did you know that?"
hanna,Yes...
knepfler,She had your eyes. He smiles at her. She here's a noise outside and runs to look out the window. She sees ISAACS BMW pull up outside the house followed by a second car.
hanna,It's him.
knepfler,Quick. KNEPFLER leads HANNA out of the kitchen.
knepfler,Upstairs. There's a knock at the door. HANNA begins to climb the stairs while KNEPFLER approaches the front door. There's another knock at the door.
marissa,Erik Heller? Do you know him?
knepfler,I have never heard of him.
marissa,"Really? MARISSA shows him the photograph of JOANNA, ERIK and KNEPFLER outside the house."
knepfler,I don't know these people.
marissa,Think very carefully He shrugs and MARISSA grabs KNEPFLER by the throat. He speaks in gasps.
knepfler,He called me. She's coming soon. To meet him.
marissa,When?
knepfler,Tomorrow! Tomorrow morning. MARISSA lets him go. She turns to ISAACS.
marissa,Take him in there. Find out what he knows.
marissa,Lewis. It's Marissa. HANNA hears the name. The name of the woman she thought she had killed. Her face pale in shock and fear.
isaacs,His name's Klaus Knepfler. He used to send Heller's things from Berlin before the Communists were kicked out of Prague.
marissa,How much does he know about the programme?
isaacs,Everything. He knew Johanna.
marissa,What does he know about the child?
isaacs,He also thinks Erik's the father.
marissa,Well that's good.
isaacs,Everybody thinks Erik's her father. Erik probably thinks he's her father. They snigger. HANNA's eyes widen in shock. She can barely control her breath.
marissa,Crazy bastard. You got a fix on him yet?
isaacs,"Let's see what else Knepfler has to offer. He leaves her. MARISSA suddenly senses something. Did she hear an intake of breath? She turns and quickly looks under the bed. No one there. Her imagination maybe. MARISSA stands and we see the shoes walk away to the door. They reach the door. HANNA, clinging to the bedsprings in mid- air, not breathing. The green shoes leave. HANNA breathes. Hurriedly she climbs out from under the bed and goes to a window."
owner,Excuse me. You have to pay first.
hanna,How much?
owner,3 Euros for half an hour. She looks at the money that Knepfler gave her. It contains Euros. She hands some over to the OWNER.
hanna,How does it work?
owner,You've never used the internet?
hanna,No. He smiles in amazement and logs on for her. The owner brings up a search engine.
owner,Just type whatever it is you're looking for here. He walks away and HANNA slowly starts to type. She types in
isaacs,Isaacs. He listens. Puts the phone down.
marissa,Hanna?
isaacs,Next they searched the name Johanna Zadek.
marissa,She's not coming here.
hanna,(In German w/ English
kurdish woman,(In Kurdish w/ English
erik,Marissa would have been much too careful for that. HANNA stares at him. ERIK HELLER.
hanna,Are you my father?
erik,Sit down.
hanna,Are you my father?
erik,Please.
hanna,Are you? Moment of electric silence between them. ERIK does nothing but she knows the answer is no.
erik,I was going to tell you. HANNA sinks to the floor. Breathing fast.
hanna,What's wrong with me? ERIK flinches slightly.
erik,Nothing.
hanna,Where was I born? ERIK knows he has to tell the truth.
erik,At Galinka.
hanna,What's that?
erik,It was a secret CIA research programme in rural Poland.
hanna,What kind of research?
erik,Children. HANNA stares at ERIK.
erik,"Reduce capacity for fear. For pity. Increase muscle strength. Heighten senses. Anything that might make a better soldier. HANNA looks up, stares at him. It's her he's talking about."
hanna,How did you know about it? ERIK's stares right at her.
erik,I worked for it. She stares at him. He hands her a piece of paper from his pocket.
hanna,Disposed of?
erik,I tried to save all of you. But you were the only one I was able to rescue.
hanna,Keep away from me. ERIK approaches her. With real conviction.
erik,It worked. You worked.
hanna,You mean I'm a killer?
erik,No... no.. He makes to touch her. HANNA springs back in violent repulsion.
hanna,Don't touch me.
erik,"We have a new identity for you. A new life. A new beginning. She stares at him, then pushes past him. ERIK stops, pushes her back but then HANNA grabs a sharp letter opener."
hanna,Let me go. He releases her. She goes to the door.
erik,I tried to prepare you for what your life would be.
hanna,You didn't prepare me for this. And her look is so full of pain that in that moment ERIK knows he has done a terrible wrong. She starts to leave down the fire escape. ERIK calls after her.
erik,"Hanna wait. He looks out to watch her go. It's then ERIK sees the cars coming across the estate scrubland. ERIK turns in panic. And dashes back into the apartment, runs through the destroyed living room, and out through the front door."
day,"ERIK comes out of the main entrance and runs into full view of the cars, deliberately distracting them from HANNA."
marissa,That's him. And the car swerves to follow him. Thus moving unknowingly away from the slight figure of HANNA. HANNA can see the cars in full chase of Erik Heller. He has distracted them.
erik,So go ahead. She stares at him. Wants to make this as painful as she can for him.
marissa,You know I'll find her.
erik,Don't under estimate what you created.
marissa,"What we created, together."
marissa,Truth is I was always very fond of you.
marissa,Leave him here. And they all walk away leaving him alone in the East Berlin dirt.
isaacs,They had a fight.
marissa,She must know the truth.
isaacs,Where do you think she's gone?
marissa,Where would you go? MARISSA turns to ISAACS.
hanna,I am looking for a train to Galinka.
guard,Galinka is a small village. No trains. You must wait for bus in the morning.
hanna,Where can I stay? He points. HANNA sees the hotel.
hanna,Do you have a sandwich?
barman,Kitchen is closed. The BUSINESSMAN speaks in German.
businessman,"Get her something. Poor girl's hungry. The barman disappears. HANNA looks round, waits."
hanna,The same.
businessman,"Business? He looks at her body. HANNA senses it. Her sandwich arrives. It's grim. She leaves it, walks out."
hanna,I am tired. I need to sleep. She leaves the bar. HANNA walks back up the stairs. BUSINESSMAN follows.
businessman,"Hello? She walks along the corridor, gets to her room. BUSINESSMAN follows."
hanna,I have this much. Can you take me to Galinka?
driver,This is as far as the money gets you. HANNA looks out. Middle of nowhere.
hanna,How much further?
driver,Twelve miles.
hanna,"Please. But no smile from him, nothing. HANNA gets out. Starts to walk as the taxi turns and drives back the way it came."
marissa,It's a very dull place Galinka. Why would you want to go there?
hanna,I was born there. But I've never really seen it. Why are you going?
marissa,"I have some business to sort out. She looks at her and smiles a sunny, uncomplicated smile."
hanna,Yes...
marissa,You've hurt your arm.
hanna,It's okay. MARISSA hands her some tissue. HANNA bandages the arm.
marissa,I'm Astrid.
hanna,You're not German. Are you American?
marissa,That's right. I lived there for many years. I travel a lot. MARISSA smiles at her kindly. HANNA feels safe for the first time in ages. She feels the tears come.
hanna,Sorry.
marissa,It's okay. Are you in trouble? HANNA nods. She fights the tears. MARISSA gently holds her hand as she drives. HANNA weeping.
hanna," I don't know what to do. Nothing is what I thought it would be. It's... ugly and cruel and I don't know where to go, or... I'm stupid. I don't know what I expected... MARISSA secretly, genuinely affected by this. Fights the emotion that has surprised her. Human warmth."
marissa,Sometimes I feel the same way.
hanna,I like music.
marissa,"Sleep why don't you? You look very tired. It will take half an hour on this road. HANNA nods. She begins to drift off, so long since she has slept. Her eyes fall shut and her head rests against the window. She is asleep. Vulnerable."
hanna,Where are we? MARISSA calms herself instantly.
marissa,Nearly there. HANNA doesn't see MARISSA'S SHOES.
hanna,It's so small.
marissa,Yes. Just a few cottages. And the old bunker. HANNA chooses not to ask any more questions.
hanna,Thank you for the ride. You're very kind.
marissa,I wish there was more I could do for you. MARISSA looks kindly at HANNA who is confused by the intimacy. MARISSA reaches into the glove compartment and retrieves a torch which she hands to HANNA.
hanna,Thank you. She gets out and shuts the door behind her.
children,"Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you... From the far end of the dormitory come a procession of CHILDREN, the first of whom is carrying a large birthday cake lit with birthday candles. The children's faces glow eerily in the candle light. They're looking at HANNA and walking straight towards her as they sing."
hanna,"You're Marissa Wiegler. HANNA starts to shake. MARISSA has her gun pointing at HANNA but her expression is the same sunny, uncomplicated smile as earlier. Dead silence. HANNA breathing fast. MARISSA speaks in English."
marissa,Don't worry sweetie. I don't want to hurt you. MARISSA'S tone has turned into a twisted interpretation of maternal care. HANNA does not move. Like a wild animal cornered.
hanna,"Where are the other children? She looks at MARISSA, who waits, then answers quietly."
marissa,Sleeping. They're all sleeping.
hanna,I don't believe you.
marissa,"I can protect you, Hanna. Make sure you walk out of here and keep walking. Grow up and grow old in safety and security. No one need know a thing. But you have to trust me. You can't talk about this with anyone. It's what we call classified. If you tell anyone, it'll be dangerous for both of us. HANNA looks at her, remembering what ERIK told her, trying hard not to succumb."
hanna,You killed my mother.
marissa,"You're mother didn't want you, sweetie. I saved you. HANNA just stares, not believing her."
hanna,"No more. No more. Tears are streaming down her face as she reaches sight of the tunnel mouth and the daylight beyond. Standing in silhouette is MARISSA. HANNA slows her pace and stops when she can see the white of MARISSA'S eyes and the finger on MARISSA'S trigger. MARISSA raises the gun and aims at HANNA - but HANNA comes forward again, walking calmly towards her. She stops and drops her gun to the ground."
marissa,Let me take care of you?
hanna,No. I don't want that. HANNA turns her back on MARISSA and starts to walks in the opposite direction. MARISSA watches her walk away. HANNA walks waiting for the shot to come.
marissa,"Hanna. HANNA spins, fires directly at CAMERA."
