Speaker,Dialogue
edward, Left pocket.
vance,"Look, we're talking about hard assets and a straight liquidation. We have over a thousand man hours in this deal."
stuckey," This is a ""no brainer"".  There's no risk for you.  No one has ever lost money backing Mr. Harris."
stuckey," Come on.  You know we're not going to go into ship building. Besides, you're the ones with the troubled track record, not us!"
edward,It's unacceptable.
edward,Draymen Heux has offered me seventy-five in the pool at sixteen and a half.  I can secure the other half personally.  You have until tomorrow morning to make me a better offer.
edward,"The meeting is over, gentlemen."
stuckey,Hah!  Did you see the look on their faces?
vance,You don't think we pushed too hard?
stuckey,"NO way!  They'll come back.  They can't afford not to.  Edward, that bluff was beautiful."
edward,Maybe I should have made it rhyme.
edward, Well!  It's late.  We've been at this long enough.
edward,"Gentlemen, enjoy the party.  The magician's wonderful."
edward, Watch your left pocket.
butler,"Phone call, Mr. Harris.  It's Miss Charles."
stuckey,Cynthia?  Is she coming out?
edward,We're about to find out.  Go on. Take care of your guests.
edward," No, I don't expect you to be at my beck-and-call.  Are you coming or not?"
edward, Prepare the filing papers.  Have them ready by the middle of the week.  I'll tell you when to submit them.
a man,Edward!

elizabeth, Is Edward leaving?
stuckey,"What's up, where you going?"
edward,"Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel."
stuckey,At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
edward,Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
stuckey,"Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you..."
edward," No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one."
stuckey,Cynthia's not coming?
edward,No.
stuckey,Let your driver take you.  We'll move the cars...
stuckey,Can you drive a stick?
stuckey,"Edward, give me a break!"
edward,Love this car!  Is it new?

stuckey,That's the wrong way!

kit,Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
vivian,I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
kit,Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.

kit,"I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?"
vivian,"No, let's go to work.  Okay?"
kit,Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
kit,"No no, honey.  You see these stars on the sidewalk.  Me and Vivian work from Don Ameche all the way up to Roy Rogers. This is our office.  We got seniority.  Get off our corner."
rachel,"I was just taking a rest here. Besides, she's new. "
kit,But I'm old.  Go rest up by Monty Hall or Debra Paget where you belong.
vivian, Looks slow tonight.
kit,Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
vivian,Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
kit,I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
vivian, That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
vivian,He's not gonna want us.
edward, Excuse me.
kit," Don't take less than a hundred. You look hot tonight.  And remember, don't mouth off.  They don't like that."
vivian,Okay.  Go home.  But take it easy on that shit.
kit,You're the greatest.  I'll wait up for you.
vivian,"Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?"
edward,What's that?
vivian,You looking' for some company?
edward,"Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?"
vivian,What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
edward,Yes.
vivian,Great.  What do I look like a tourguide?
edward," No, you look like a hooker."
vivian,"Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk."
edward,Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
vivian,Sure.  For five bucks.
edward,That's ridiculous.
vivian,The price just went up to ten.
edward,Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
vivian, Sit... and spin.
edward,Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?
edward, You have change for a twenty.
vivian,"For twenty, Ill show you personal.  Drive."
vivian,Nice car.  Yours?
edward, No.
vivian,Stolen?
edward,Not exactly.
vivian,Mind if I turn on some heat?
edward,"If you can figure it out, be my guest."
edward,Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
vivian," You're not from L.A., huh?"
edward,New York.
vivian,What motel you staying at?
edward,Hotel.
vivian,"Okay, what hotel?"
edward,Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
vivian," Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break."
edward,What's your name?
vivian,"What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian."
edward,"You like being a hooker, Vivian?"
vivian,It pays.
edward,So do day jobs.
vivian, Turn right.
edward,Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
vivian,"Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer."
edward,Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
vivian," If you're making fun of me, I don't like it."
edward,"Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to."
edward,"Ugly habit, biting your nails."
vivian,"You don't know habits, you think this is ugly."
vivian,"Okay, pull over.  Let me out. I've got to get back to work."
edward,"What do you charge for company, Vivian?"
vivian,Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
edward,For the whole night?
vivian,For an hour.
edward,You're joking.
vivian,I never joke about money.
edward,Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
vivian,"No, but it's getting there."
edward,"Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?"
vivian,You couldn't afford it.
edward,Try me.
vivian,Three hundred.
edward,Fine.
vivian,"What's your name, lover."
edward,Edward.  My name is Edward.
vivian,Edward... you got it!
edward,Get in.  This side.
vivian,What?
edward,You know how to drive a stick?
vivian,Better believe it.
edward,Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
vivian,Here we go Edward.
edward,My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
vivian,Why?
edward,You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
vivian,You mean they don't have hookers.
edward,"Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're..."
vivian,Off the boulevard.
edward,Exactly.
vivian,Great.  Now I took like a hooker in a trenchcoat.
vivian,So let's go.
operator,"Evening, sir."
edward,Good evening.  Penthouse.
vivian,"Penthouse.  My, my."
vivian,The penthouse.  And step on it.
edward, What do you drink?
vivian,Diet coke.
edward, Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
vivian,Can I have some chips?
edward, -- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.
edward, Impressed?
vivian,You kidding?  I come here all the time.  As a matter of fact they do rent this room by the hour.
edward,Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
vivian,Do you plan everything?
edward, Always.
vivian,"Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance."
edward,Fair enough.
edward,Let's talk some more first.
vivian,Right.  So!  In town on business?
edward, Uh-huh.
vivian,"Let me guess, you're a... lawyer."
edward, And why do you say that?
vivian," I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look."
edward,Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
vivian,I've known a lot of everybody.
edward,Champagne.
vivian,Hey.  I might as well make myself useful.
waiter,Where would you like it?
vivian,Where would we like it?
edward,Where would we like it?  Here'll be fine.
vivian,What are you looking at?
edward,I think he wanted you to tip him.
vivian,"Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred."
edward,I have both.
vivian,Where are they?  Shopping together?
edward,They should be.  They're both good at it.
edward,It's a very good year.
vivian,"Oooh, thank god."
edward,Try a strawberry.
vivian,Why?
edward,Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
vivian,"Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club."
edward,Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
edward, You really are a very beautiful girl.
vivian," Just a romantic, that's you."
edward,Yes...
vivian,Me too.
edward, What do you like?
vivian,If I want you to turn me on I'll pay you three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
edward, Sorry.  Go ahead.
stuckey,Kross knows we're after his company.  He wants to talk with you.  I don't think you should.
edward,I want to.
stuckey,"Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal."
edward,I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
stuckey,You shouldn't go alone.  He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
edward,"Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car..."
stuckey,"Oh, god, what?"
edward, I'll bring it back.
edward,Good morning.
vivian,You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
edward,No hurry.  Would you like some breakfast?
vivian,Only if you do.
edward,Did you sleep well?
vivian,Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
edward,Occupational hazard?
vivian,Where'd you go?
edward,I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
vivian,"Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself."
edward,"Mmm, I could tell."
vivian,I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
edward,I'd say you give a good dollar value.
edward,Do you ever... enjoy it?
vivian,I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
edward,No?  Why's that?
vivian,"""Occupational hazard""."
edward,I buy companies.
vivian,No shit.  They expensive?
edward,The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
vivian,... dollars?
vivian,So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
edward, I sell them.
vivian,What?  Why?
edward,By breaking up a company's assets --
vivian,What are assets?
edward,Vivian --
vivian,"C'mon, I might buy a company some day."
edward,"Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit."
vivian,"Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?"
edward,Not... quite.
vivian,"There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot."
edward,Where'd you learn to do this?
vivian, I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
edward,Don't drown.
vivian,You could hold a pep rally in here!
edward, Yes.
stuckey,"Edward, it's me.  Kross is all set for tonight."
stuckey,"Listen, I gotta say this again, I don't like you going alone."
edward, I'm a big boy.
stuckey,Let me at least get you a date. Keep it social.
stuckey,"Edward, did you hear me?"
edward,I'm here.
stuckey,I know a lot of nice girls.
edward,I have one.
edward,All right.  How much for the week?
vivian,What?
edward,I'm in town until Saturday.
edward,Do-you-want-to-stay-here- for-the-week?
vivian,It'd cost you.
edward,Of course.  How much?
vivian,Five full nights... days too?
vivian,Four thousand.
edward,"Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night"
vivian,But you want days too.
edward,"All right, two thousand."
vivian,Three.
edward,Done.
vivian,Holy shit.
edward,I'm not just talking about sex.
vivian,"Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?"
edward,"Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go."
edward,I'll be out most of the day.
edward,I want you to go out and buy some decent clothes.
edward,"Nothing too flashy, not too sexy. Conservative.  Understand?"
vivian,"Yeah, you want me to dress like your high class girlfriend. You're wasting your money though. All I'm gonna do is hang around the hotel.  As a matter of fact, I may never get out of that bathtub."
edward,Think again.  I'm taking you out to an important dinner with me tonight.
edward,Probably.
vivian,Three thousand...
vivian,Three thousand!
vivian,Kit!  Where've you been?
vivian,"Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?"
vivian,He... he just does.
vivian,"Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out."
kit,I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
vivian,"Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on him."
vivian,Yeah.
saleswoman, May I help you?
vivian,"I'm just looking, thanks."
saleswoman,Are you looking for something in particular?
vivian,Yes.  Something... conservative.
saleswoman,Yes...
vivian,You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
saleswoman,I don't think it would fit you.
vivian, I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
saleswoman,It's very expensive.
vivian,What is with you?
saleswoman, Excuse me?
vivian,I'm going to spend money.
saleswoman,I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
vivian,I'm just going to my room.
vivian,I'm -- I'm with a friend.
vivian,I... Edward...
vivian, He knows me.
operator,She's with Mr. Harris.
operator,She apparently joined him last night.
vivian,Vivian.
vivian,Niece?
vivian,That's what I was trying to do.
vivian,Barney.
vance,Okay... this is the jewel in Kross's crown.  We can strip out all the heavy equipment.  Some of the cranes are very valuable overseas.  The Japanese are salivating for them.
stuckey,Prime industrial property straddling the Port of Long Beach and Los Angeles.  It gives me a hard-on.
edward,What's that long building over there?
jake,"Storage, I think."
edward,Not with those smokestacks it's not.
vance,Let me check.
jake,"The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --"
edward,You what?
jake,I talked to some developers about the land.
stuckey,What kind of an idiot are you? You don't talk about this to anyone.
jake,"They're close friends, they'd never breathe a word --"
stuckey, Where did you dig this moron up?
vance,"He's right, Jake, that was an incredibly stupid thing to do. It won't happen again, Edward. I'll pull him off the project immediately."
edward,Don't bother.
stuckey,What!?
edward,"We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?"
jake,"It won't happen again, Mr. Harris."
vance,"This is interesting.  That building is storage now, but it used to be a smelting plant.  They closed it down after World War II."
edward,I want our lawyers to check into the toxic waste licences on them right away.  I want to know if the permits are still valid and what kind of limits are on them.
stuckey,"Jesus, yes.  It's a long shot but if the permits are still in effect, they're worth a fortune."
edward,What time's diner tonight?
stuckey,"Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?"
edward,No one you know.
bridget,You must be Vivian.
vivian, Georgia.
bridget,"No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are horrid, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?"
vivian,Well... I might be going out to dinner.
bridget,You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
vivian,"I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?"
bridget, Philip!  We'll need shoes!
bridget,Your uncle will like this.
vivian,He's not really my uncle.
bridget,"They never are, dear."
vivian,I got a dress.
vivian,I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
vivian,"They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney."
vivian,Hello?
edward,Never answer the phone.  Ever.
vivian,"Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time."
edward,Did you buy some clothes?
vivian,"I got a dress, yeah."
edward,Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
vivian,It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
edward,Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
vivian,"No, I don't ""got it"".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date."
edward,This isn't a date.
vivian,Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
edward,The Rex.
vivian,Any good?
edward,I think you'll approve.
vivian,... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
edward,Thank you very much.
vivian,Hello?
edward,I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
vivian,Oooh!
maid,"Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed."
vivian,What?
maid,Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.
vivian,Okay.
vivian,Is there a trick to it?
vivian,Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
maid,I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
vivian,"Oooh, I love those."
maid,"I leave extras, miss."
vivian,"Thanks!  Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?"
vivian,Barney.
vivian,Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
vivian,"Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?"
vivian,Will I like it?
vivian,"Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best."
vivian,Fork?
vivian,But I always eat like this.
vivian,Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
vivian,What if they serve soup?
vivian,But what if they serve soup?
vivian, I like steak.
vivian,Steak spoon! 
vivian,"Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands."
vivian,Professionally?
vivian,I have a friend who has a friend who does Cher's wigs.
thane,I hate him already.  All set?
vivian,Yeah... what a ya say we chop it all off and bleach the tips.
thane,Darling?  Trust me.
edward,"Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --"
edward,My what?
edward,I think we both know she's not my niece.
edward,Thank you.
vivian,You're late.
edward,I'm sorry.
vivian,You're forgiven.
kross,"So young man, I understand you are trying to take over my company."
edward,"Please don't patronize me, Mr. Kross.  Our ages mean nothing here."
david,"Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share."
edward,Twenty-five percent.
kross,"Mr. Harris, I built Kross Enterprises myself.  I know every man who ever worked there by his first name.  I know their wives... and their children.  If your intention is to take over my company and turn it into a glorified real estate deal, think again."
edward,"What do you suggest, Mr. Kross?"
kross,What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.
edward,To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
david,We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
edward,You're not getting any navy contracts.
david,There's no way you could know that.
edward,"But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot."
vivian," Scume me, what are these things?"
waiter," Escargot, mademoiselle."
edward, Snails.
edward,"Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours."
kross, You've got a lot of nerve.
edward,No.  What I have is a lot of money.
kross,"I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks."
edward, What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
kross,I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
edward," It is not your company.  It's a public company.  And I am going to acquire it.  Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you."
vivian,Slippery little suckers...
kross,"If you'll excuse me young lady, Mr. Harris...  Deal with this, David, you know where we stand.  I need to go someplace and puke."
david," Men like my father built this country.  He was no saint.  He screwed people.  But for every guy he stepped on, he gave a hundred a good job."
vivian,He seems like a nice man.
edward,We can reach an understanding on this.
david,I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
edward,Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
david,"I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian."
edward, And that's the way the game is played.
vivian,Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
vivian,Snails for dinner.  No wonder everybody is in such a bad mood.
waiter,"Are we ready for the next course, sir?"
edward,"No.  Bring a check, please."
edward,Thank you.
vivian,"You're upset, huh?"
edward,Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
vivian,"You liked the guy, though."
edward,Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
vivian, Except with you.  At your price I give my all...
edward,That... is very good.
vivian,Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
edward,Television?
vivian,"Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all."
edward,I have work to do.
vivian,Uh-uh.  No work.
edward,I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
vivian,I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
edward,Why not?
vivian,"Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works."
edward,Was someone rude to you?
vivian,I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
edward,"Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you."
vivian, Okay.
edward,Good.
vivian, Come with me?
vivian,Please.
vivian, Hello.  Can you help me?
vivian," I'm looking for a dress, nothing too flashy, not too sexy, conservative.  In a size six."
salesgirl, Do... do you have a charge account with us?
vivian, I look like fucking Nancy Reagan.
vance,Kross came out of his corner swinging.  He started buying up all available stock as soon as the market opened.
edward, He's a tough old son of a bitch...
vance,It's up to ten and a quarter.
edward,Offer nine and a half.  Bring them back down to earth.
stuckey,Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
edward,Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
stuckey,Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry.
edward, Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
stuckey, We're letting them slide?
edward,I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
stuckey,"But, Edward..."
edward,Do it.
edward," You're on your own now, Vivian. I've got to get to work.  Be sensible and you can keep everything.  Spend too much and it all goes back."
vivian,Not me!
vivian, Horrid!
vivian,Where'd you get your tie?
saleswoman, Isn't this lovely?  I think it would look wonderful on you.
saleswoman, Would you like to try it on?
vivian,'Scume me.
saleswoman,Yes?
vivian,Do you remember me?
saleswoman,"No, I'm sorry, I don't."
vivian,I was in here yesterday.
vivian,"Yeah.  That's right.  It's me. I want you to know something. You made me feel terrible. I wasn't dressed right and you said I didn't belong here.  Well, I do.  You're the one that was wrong, not me.  And I want to tell you something else.  I'm never gonna shop here again as long as I live."
vivian,Wheee!!!
stuckey, You were right.  Kross mortgaged everything he has down to his grandson's college tuition to secure loans from a bank.  Not just any bank.  One we do business with.
stuckey,"Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --"
edward,"Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money."
stuckey,"And some of it's mine.  Edward, his jugular's exposed."
edward,Get the bank on the phone for me.
vivian,I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
edward,Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
vivian,Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
edward,Please.
vivian,What about dinner?
edward,Dinner can wait.
vivian,You always been rich?
edward,No.
vivian,"Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?"
edward,"Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him."
vivian,Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
edward,Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
vivian,You still mad at'm?
edward,He died a long time ago.
waiter,You have a call.  Mr. Harris.
vivian, I'll be ready.  Bye.
vivian,What do you wear to polo?
vivian,"You're really pushing it, bringing me here."
edward,I think it's exciting.
vivian,What id we run into someone I know?
edward,I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
vivian,You did.
stuckey," Well, well, well..."
edward,"Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian."
stuckey," Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife, Elizabeth."
vivian,Hi.
stuckey,Lots of fun people here.  Let me get you two some champagne.
elizabeth stuckey,Excuse me.
vivian, Real genuine guy.
edward,He's good at what he does.
vivian,You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
edward, Shall we mingle?
woman,"I simply love your dress, Vivian."
vivian,This old thing?
woman,"Of course, a figure like yours can wear anything.  You must work out constantly."
vivian,I lead a very physical life.
older man,"Are you into running, Vivian?"
vivian,I'm into walking.  I walk a lot.
another man,"You look awfully familiar, Vivian. Haven't we run into one another at the spa in La Costa?"
vivian,"Well, I do often spa there."
elizabeth stuckey,"Edward, she's marvelous.  Warm and witty and down to earth."
edward," She is, isn't she."
elizabeth stuckey,So unlike your usuals.  Where on earth did you find her?
a woman,"We're good together.  He has to admit it.  I've been just what he wants me to be.  I say the right things, I know the right people, I give wonderful parties. No question, no arguments, no embarrassments.  It works for both of us."
vivian,"Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money."
edward,I'm sure that's true for some of them.
vivian,I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
edward, Ready to stomp sod?
david kross,Hi.
vivian,Hi.  I never thought stomping in grass could be so much fun.
david, I like your hat.
vivian,Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
david,"Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder."
vivian,"Please, we hardly know each other."
david,Thunder's a horse.  Come on.
david,"Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?"
vivian,No.
david,Hope to be?
vivian,It's... it's not like that.
david,I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
vivian,You don't know anything about me.
david,I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
stuckey,Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet?
edward,We just did.
stuckey," Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this."
edward,"The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions."
stuckey,And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
edward,Yes...
stuckey,Doing what?
edward,Vivian's in sales.
stuckey,"Sales, really?  That's great. What does she sell?"
edward,Why do you want to know?
stuckey,Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
edward,She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
stuckey,"So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient."
edward,You're being ridiculous.
stuckey,"Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?"
edward,"Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker.  I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard."
stuckey,"I swear to God, you are the only millionaire I ever heard of who'd go looking for a goddam bargain streetwalker!"
edward,"Let's drop it, shall we?"
man,Edward!  May we have your opinion on something?
edward, Excuse me a moment.
stuckey,"Having a good time, Vivian?"
vivian,Yeah.  Thanks.
stuckey,All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard.
vivian,What?
stuckey,It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
vivian, Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
stuckey,I just might do that.
edward,You're awfully quiet.  You haven't said a word since the party.
vivian,You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
edward,"Vivian, what the --"
vivian,"Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!"
edward,I don't know what you're talking about.
vivian,I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
edward,Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
vivian,"Stuckey!  He wants an ""appointment"" with me after you leave.  You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?"
edward,What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
vivian,I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
edward,Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
vivian,"Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money."
vivian," Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone."
edward,Vivian...
vivian,Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
edward,Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
vivian,Fuck off.
edward,"I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up."
edward,Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.
vivian,"I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off."
edward,I really am sorry.
vivian,You hurt me.
edward,I'll make it up to you.
stuckey,This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
edward,Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
stuckey,Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
edward,"Goodbye, Bill."
stuckey,"Shit... By tomorrow, Edward!"
edward,Afternoon.
vivian,"C'mon, Kit..."
vivian,Do I look okay?
edward," Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing."
vivian,What's that?
edward,I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
edward,This is made for a princess. I think she'd approve of you wearing it tonight.  There. Come look.
vivian,"Edward, I can't."
edward,Shush.  Of course you can.
vivian,What if I lose it?
edward,You won't.
vivian,What if someone tries to steal it?
edward,I'll guard them and you with my life.
pilot,"Your plane is ready to go, Mr. Harris."
edward,Very good.
vivian,Plane?
edward,"You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't."
vivian,Where are you taking me!?
edward,"To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker..."
vivian,Huh?
edward,The opera.
vivian,I've never been on a plane before.
edward,"I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these."
edward,"Vivian, what do you think you're doing?"
vivian,Being quiet.
vivian,Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
edward,Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
vivian,"You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff."
edward,What happened to him?
vivian,"My father found me.  Dragged me home.  I don't know why, he never seemed to like me much when I was there.  I made it back to Atlanta a year later.  Andy was gone."
vivian,"Aw, but things sure look fine when you're sitting way up high."
edward,"Some people say that opera is an acquired taste, but I don't believe it.  You can always tell when someone goes to the opera for the first time.  They either love it or hate it.  Those who love it will always love it; those who hate it might come to appreciate it, but they'll never truly love it."
edward,Viv?  I really doubt if anyone here is going to try and grab it.
edward,"They all think you look very beautiful, Vivian."
vivian,"If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?"
edward,I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
vivian,But don't they have it in English?
edward,"Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it."
vivian," Okay.  Even if I hate it, I'm glad you brought me."
edward,What am I?  I am a poet.  Not a man of wealth but one rich in dreams.  You have come to replace my vanished dreams.  I dwell now only in your eyes.
edward,And now she asks Rudolpho if he still thinks her beautiful --
older woman,"Did you enjoy the opera, dear?"
vivian, It was so beautiful I just about pissed my pants.
edward,"If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you."
vivian,I more than liked it.
edward,I know.  I'm glad.
vivian,Did you?
edward,Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.
vivian,Love you...
edward,Yes?
stuckey,Did I wake you?
edward,I'm up.
stuckey,I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
edward,Why?
stuckey,He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and we got him.  You there?
edward,Give me twenty minutes.
stuckey,"We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning."
vivian,Mmm.  Hi.
edward,Better get dressed.  We're having guests.
vivian,Here.  Let me.
edward, One more night and you're finally rid of me.
vivian,"Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take."
edward,I have to go to New York tomorrow.
vivian, What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
edward,It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
vivian,"I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it..."
edward,"Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution."
vivian," When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, ""Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."""
edward,"Vivian, life's not a fairy tale."
vivian," I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore."
edward,I've never treated you like a whore.
vivian, You just did.
kross,Mr. Harris.
edward,"How are you, Mr. Kross."
kross,Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights.  I'll get used to it.
kross,Young lady.
vivian,Hello.  Hi.
david,"Hello, Vivian."
stuckey,"Let's not waste time here, shall we?  Mr. Kross, you said this morning, you wished to speak with Mr. Harris.  Mr. Harris is now listening."
kross,Yes.  I'm here to tell you that I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
edward,Expected... offer.
kross,"Of course, yes.  After the expected filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid."
edward," You're making the right decision, sir."
kross,I'll see you on one condition. I'm not so concerned for me but the people who have worked for me...
stuckey," They'll be taken care of.  Won't they, Edward?"
kross,I'll sign anything you want then.
stuckey,Today.
kross,Today.
edward,"Excuse me, please?"
vivian,Hello.  Is Kit DeLuca there? When she comes in will you have her call Vivian Wells at 560-30000. Yes.  Okay.
vivian,What did you do to him?
edward,What do you mean?
vivian,Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you liked him.
edward,"Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated."
vivian,Right.
edward,"It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all."
vivian,Business.
edward,Yes.  The man made a business decision.
vivian,It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
edward,It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
edward,I'll be back in a few hours. We'll talk about this later.
edward,We'll continue this down at the office.
vivian,Lo?
vivian,Me?
kit,"Viv?  Where are you, babe?  The sphincter-police won't let me through."
vivian,"Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling."
kit,Was that you?
vivian,Who did you think?
kit,Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
vivian,"Kit, I left that money for you days ago."
kit,Yeah.  I just got it.
kit,"Fifty bucks, grampa.  For seventy-five, the wife can watch."
vivian,Kit...
kit,Everybody keeps starin' at me.
vivian,Yeah... I know what you mean.
kit,"What do you know?  You look good. All dressed up.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway."
vivian,You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
kit,Where do you fit?
vivian," I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth."
kit,"Honey, you're not supposed to do that."
vivian,I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
kit,"Oh, my god, you mean it was good?"
vivian, It was great.
kit,Dummy.
vivian,"He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money."
kit,I pray for that.
vivian," All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?"
kit,Go for the bucks.
vivian,I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
kit,"Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart."
jake,"Congratulations, sir."
edward,What?
jake,Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished.  You've won.
jake,"Who are you going after next, sir?"
edward,Who indeed...
stuckey,If we can get these letters of intent out of the way now... Mr. Harris and I would like to ask you some questions about your company.
david,"Dad, excuse me, but that's inappropriate.  You're under no obligation to answer any questions at all."
kross,Could we at least wait till after the filing period?
stuckey,"Mr. Harris is preparing a bid based on our speculation of the corporation's net worth.  The price he ultimately pays for your father's stock will be based on that bid.  The more we know, the higher our bid can be."
kross,"It's in my best interest to cooperate, David."
david,"If he throws himself on your sword, you promise to take care of him and his family, huh?"
stuckey,That's unfair!
david,"You bed it is.  Do what you have to do, Dad. Just don't expect me to watch it."
kross,He's young.  He hasn't learned how to lose gracefully yet.  I'll sign your papers.  And I'll answer your questions.  Whatever you want.
edward,"Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions before you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?"
kross,Yes.
edward,"If you had a... reprieve, what would do?"
stuckey, I don't think there's any sense in --
edward,Let him answer.
kross,I... I would take advantage of it.
edward,How?
kross,I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
edward,"I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that."
stuckey,"Oh, my god... Edward, no!"
edward,"I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?"
stuckey,Have you lost your mind?
kross, Would I get the loans?
edward,"This time I imagine you would, yes.  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?"
kross," You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris."
edward,You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
stuckey,What!?
edward,"Have a good day, gentlemen."
stuckey," Edward, what happened?  What kind of move was that?"
stuckey," Dammit Edward, speak to me."
edward,No... take the car back to the hotel.  I need to walk.
stuckey,"Well, well... Hello again.  I'm looking for Edward."
vivian,Edward's not back.  I thought he was with you.
stuckey,"No, I'll just have to wait then, won't I?"
vivian,No.
stuckey,"Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities."
vivian,I think it's great.
stuckey,I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
vivian," Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business."
stuckey,"But what do I know, maybe you're worth it.  Come on, show me. Let's see your act."
vivian,Get out!
stuckey,"Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, maybe?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?"
vivian,Are you crazy?
stuckey,"You got a mean streak in you, don't you."
stuckey,You broke my nose.
edward,I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
stuckey,"Edward, we've been together ten years."
edward,"And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!"
stuckey,All this because of that whore!
edward,Yes.
stuckey,"Edward, think about what you're --"
edward," Well, I didn't plan that!"
vivian,"Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!"
edward,Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
vivian,Right.  I heard what you did with Kross.
edward,It was a business decision.
edward,I got tired of hating my father.
vivian, It was good.
edward,It felt good.
edward,You're packing.
vivian," Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please."
vivian,"Aw, don't... no..."
edward,Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
vivian,"I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving.  That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.  I want a guy like you for real.  Not because you buy me things and give me money.  The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?"
vivian,I didn't think so.
edward,Vivian...
vivian,It's not your fault.  You're right.  Kit's right.  But I want the fairy tale.
bellman,"Let me take those, miss."
vivian,Thanks.
vivian,I'll be out front in a minute. I got a cab comin'.
vivian,"Hi, Barney!"
vivian,Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
vivian,"Yeah, well, I check out today."
vivian," You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas."
driver,"You're sure this is the right street, ma'am?"
vivian,Yes. 1312.  It's a big apartment building.
limo driver,Maybe I should go with you.  This doesn't look like a good place for a lady to be alone.
vivian,I'll be okay.  I'm home.  Thank you.
landlord,"Hey, we announce guests here. You a relative of somebody?"
vivian,"Yeah, it's me."
landlord,"You lookin' good, Viv'.  Nice threads.  I gotta find time to shop."
bellman,"Is that everything, sir?"
edward, That's everything.
maid,"The lady, she go?"
edward,Yes.  She go.
bellhop,"Do you have a car taking you to the airport, sir?"
edward,Yes.
kit,So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
vivian,Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
kit,What kind of school?
vivian,"School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know."
kit,"So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a ""B.""  Lift your dress and an ""A"" you'll see."
vivian,Want a pair of boots?
kit,Do I!?  Momma!
vivian,You sure you won't come with me?
kit,And leave all this?  Not in a million.
vivian,Couple a hours.
kit,Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
vivian,Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
kit,"No.  You took care of rent, that's enough."
vivian,"I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away."
kit,"I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day."
kit,"Coffee, Chan.  And maybe a grilled cheese on white, okay?"
kit,"Hey, how you doin'.  You new, huh?"
girl,Yeah.  Got a cigarette?
kit,Sure.
girl,"Jeez, did the wacko in the suit."
kit,"Chan?  Keep the sandwich warm, I'll be back."
edward,"I'm looking for a girl, Vivian, young, dark hair, big eyes...?"
edward,She's mouthy.  Sort of difficult...?
prostitute 1,"Ain't seen her, wouldn't know her."
prostitute 2,"What's wrong with us, man?  Two for the price a one, what ya say?"
edward, Thank you.  No.
vivian,You are really lost this time.
