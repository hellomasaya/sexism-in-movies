one two,We need help.
mumbles,Lenny Cole?
one two,"Dog number one,..."
mumbles,But he moves fast and he loves bricks and mortar.
lenny cole,"I do move fast and I love bricks and mortar, properties are always the safe bet, but you better know what you're doing 'cos this ain't soft money. You trip up,...  And it's not me that's gonna get hurt. You got security?"
mumbles,We got property.
lenny cole,"Don't let me down boys.  Come on then, give us your hand. They shake hands and sign the papers."
councilor," Can't talk now, but there has been a problem. I can't get you the planning."
lawyer type," I'm sorry boys, can't get the planning."
one two,He can't get the planing.
mumbles,He can't get the planing?
lenny cole,"What do you mean you can't get the fuckin planning?  There is seven million of my cash in there, without planning it's worth five,...you owe me. I take the building, you lose your share, but I am still outta pocket two large ones. Find it."
lenny cole,"Is that you Councilor?  I hear you got that car you was after,....now, sort the planning out."
lenny cole,"What's wrong with you Arch? ARCHY That's a bit strong isn't it Len? They come from the same place as you, you'll clean 'em out."
lenny cole,"Same place as me? Do I look like an immigrant Archy?  No one gave me a leg up, did they? They need a bit of fear, 'cos otherwise they're gonna come up against me,...need a little lesson don't they?"
one two,We gotta sell.
mumbles,And be left with what?
one two,"Just gotta start again,...."
uri,Glad you could join us here Lenny.
lenny cole,It's nice to see you Uri.
uri,Good.  What's it going to cost me?
lenny cole,"First, let me make clear how much we can help you benefit from this deal. With out me, it will take you five to ten years to get the permission to erect your arena.  Thirdly, in legal fees, transactions and building consent, you'd be paying 6 to 12 million without any real guarantee of that result."
uri,"So Lenny,..... how much?"
lenny cole,Seven million Euros.
uri,I expect a guarantee that I have consent within six months and no red tape.
lenny cole,"That's right Uri, you can consider that done."
uri,Drink!     Follow me. 16   INT. SPORTS ARENA - PRIVATE BAR                                 16
lenny cole,"Oh, that's a nice picture Uri, hasn't it got, errrh depth?"
uri,"That picture has brought me nothing but luck Lenny,..it's my lucky picture.  You like? Take it for a while, maybe it will give you luck."
lenny cole,"Oh I couldn't Uri,..."

archy,You all right there Len?      You look a little pink.
lenny cole," Turbo, get us a perrier and a wet wipe live-o."
lenny cole,That Communism didn't seem to slow 'em down did it? We've hit the big time here Archy boy!  What's wrong? Where's the old Archy smile?
archy,"You wanna watch out there. Times are changing, they don't have too much respect for the old school."
lenny cole,"Shut up Archy,...  No school like the old school,...I still run this town see? That's why he came to me right? Got that?"
archy,"Yeah, got that."
victor,"You think you should have leant him your lucky picture? URI It makes the peasant feel royal,... don't spoil it, we need him at the moment. I want that consent.  Call the accountant and get her to clear the money."
stella,"Look, can we shut the door?"
tax man,Shut the door.
stella,Let's put our cards on the table. We both know you aren't going to get the full forty out of my clients.
tax man,This is the tax office and in the end we get what we want.
stella,"Save that speech for the tourists Charlie and let's strike a deal - take the twenty now and let it go. Otherwise, they'll move the company off shore tomorrow and you'll spend the next twenty years chasing an imaginary forty million around every republic that grows bananas."
tax man,I see why you married her now Bertie.
bertie,"I told you we'd make a great team,.. You know why you get those deals?"
stella,I don't feel like smiling. I am a thirty two year old accountant married to a homosexual lawyer.  I'm a beard without kids Bertie! I'm in a marriage of convenience that can be quite inconvenient at times.
bertie,"Yes, she's right here. "
handsome bob,"What are you talking about Fred? They got an informer, a grass, and a rat with a roach-smoking-a canary,..they've got more information than the fuckin Internet."
dolly,"Language,..."
mumbles,"Leave him alone Fred, you're stressing him out. Dolly get him a cuppa tea.  Come on deal the cards Fred."
cookie,All right chaps?
mumbles,Want to be dealt in?
cookie,"Can't stay for long, but throw us in for a quick spin."
one two,"Mumbles, can I have a word?"
mumbles,What's happening?
one two,"You know the lady, the posh one who likes abitta the rough life?"
mumbles,"The accountant, what about her? You haven't heard from her in a while, too dangerous that one."
one two,"Says she's got some work, you know,... proper work.  I would normally turn her down, but considering,..."
mumbles,Let's have a meet.
one two,I got one like that at home with a little boy fishing.
stella,"Is that what they call humor where you come from? ONE TWO Well, don't they call that art where you come from?"
stella,"You're quite the entertainer aren't you Mr. One Two? And you are late, please don't be late, I have a very busy schedule."
stella,"I have some work and thought you'd be interested, its your kind of work."
one two,Go on.
stella,"There are two accountants taking out seven million Euros from a bank I know and it won't be protected.  Twenty percent for me, as normal. The details are in here."
one two,Anything else?
stella,"Yes,..I don't want this coming back to me so, if you could give them a black eye,..that might help. She see's a slight pause and look of concern from One Two."
one two,"Ok, very good Mrs. Dexter, a black eye it is then."
stella," Why thank you, you'll be able to afford your own pair in a couple of days. Good bye."
rocker,"I need the dry ice Mickey, I need the dry ice. My show just doesn't work without it."
mickey," If you told me yesterday you needed dry ice, I would have gotten you the driest ice the world could offer, but you didn't ask for no dry ice. You asked for two cases of Johnny Walker black label and four ladies of the pole and I got them for you didn't I?"
rocker,"Yes you did I do confess, but Mickey, you're the manager and I am the rocker. You've got on the managers hat, now pluck something out of it."
mickey,"My hat is deep and full of magic. I got rabbits, handkerchiefs, and ladies of the pole drinking Black Label. I got smoke machines, bubble machines, I even got love marines and still the hat goes deeper, but....there ain't no mother fuckin dry ice."
roman,Have you read this?
mickey,What?
roman,"Johnny Story singer extraordinaire, fell off a boat, they say. Missing, assumed dead, they say."
mickey,"What,..our Johnny?"
roman,How many rock stars by the name of Johnny Story do you think there are in this universe Mickey?
mickey,"The only thing he's fallen off is his junkies spoon, he's no deader than the suit you're wearing now. He'll be gearing himself up somewhere happy as clam in a fisherman's net. Rockers like that never die, they just wither and give me pain."
lenny cole,"Johnny Story singer extraordinare, fell off a boat, missing, assumed dead."
archy,I don't know what to say Lenny.
lenny cole,"I bet he took a lot of people with him in his hot little crack pipe.  We will never mention this again, all right Arch?"
archy,"Very good councilor, you must of had lessons as a boy.  Fancy a cool down and a chat with Lenny?"
councilor,"No, no, no, Archy, don't say anything. ARCHY Don't worry, she's a friend,..and a member.  Jackie,..fancy a run'a'round with the Councilor?"
jackie,Only if he's wicked.
councilor, What does she mean by that?
archy,I think she likes you boy-o.
lenny cole,"They say that times are changing Councilor, that this country isn't what it used to be, it's the new New York, they say. You being a political man must know all about that."
councilor,"Errh, I think they are probably right, times have changed, but that shouldn't affect you Lenny."
lenny cole,"They say it's all gone ""international"" now, out with the old guard in with the new, but I think they're wrong.  Anyway, where are my manners? Look at you sweaty as a native and pink as a pelican,...and I haven't even offered you a wet one."
councilor,"A lemonade and orange please. LENNY COLE Oh that's nice,..refreshing, that'll put you back on top boy."
councilor,"I don't mind if I do,...that's a nice lighter."
lenny cole,"Eight grand they wanted for it cheeky toads and I paid, you know why?"
councilor,Tell me Lenny.
lenny cole,'Cos it's all about the details.
councilor, Is our little deal in there too Lenny?
lenny cole,"Oh I wouldn't forget that, the most important things first."
councilor,"Oh Lenny, you forgot your lighter."
lenny cole,"Can't be mine, it's got your name on it."
mumbles,"Don't you get bored of that? I mean, your not really going anywhere. If you wanna run, why don't you run to the shops or do something useful?"
one two,"You could do with some of this yourself Mumbles, you're letting yourself go.  Anyway, I'm busy, have you come to talk about anything important?"
mumbles,It's all about the zone isn't it? 
one two,"No Mumbles, I am trying to run away from you. Bob, you sorted out the car?"
handsome bob,"Yeah, it looks like a heap of shit, but it can't half go.  A bit like you One Two."
mumbles,"I reckon he's trying to get fit for the lady. Nothing gets under his skin like a lady he can't have, does it?  A straight going, cocky, educated, arrogant posh bird trips him right up. I reckon we should set Handsome Bob on her. That'll liven you up One Two."
one two,Bob wouldn't know where to begin.
handsome bob,"I'm good with the posh ones, don't you worry about that."
one two,"I've had enough of this, can you two piss off cos I am trying to find my ""zone"""
mumbles,He can't half run for a white fella.
lenny cole,Archy? You awake?

stella,"You don't need to copy anything any more, welcome to the nouveau riche Mr. One Two."
one two,Here's one for you too Mrs Dexter.
stella,Why thank you Mr. One Two. I see you didn't think much of the black eye though.
one two,"Would have liked to obliged, but from a professional point of view, it just wasn't natural,...  Until next time then."
stella,Until next time.
handsome bob,She's a looker ain't she One Two?
one two,"She's not for you Bob, that is class."
archy,"What, you got it all?"
archy,I'll come round the speeler.
lenny cole,"Archy, the Russian didn't come through with the money."

gary,"You won't see him on the cobbles at this time of night, you know how much he likes the cold. He's at the end of the street tucked up watching a Zulu movie."
tank,"Hello Arch, what you doing here?"
archy,I need a word.
tank,"Well don't stand out there on the cobbles it's freezing, step into my world.  Shavawn get us a couple of vanilla chai lattes, there's a good girl."

malcolm,Good afternoon gentlemen.
malcolm," Ok gentlemen here we go. First, my colleague Paul will be modeling the grey wolf."

malcolm,"All in good time gentlemen, all in good time.  Paul, why don't you sit down for a while."
mumbles,"Have a look at that, it's a six foot skunk."
malcolm,"And all of this could be yours for a staggeringly low,..."
malcolm,"Come on Paul, we'll be going now."
archy,"Fred,...  The speelers very quiet today, everything all right?"
archy,All right Mumbles?       One Two?
archy,So where is it then?
one two,"What, can't you smell it?"
archy,Silly bastards.
uri,"They say there are only two days you enjoy a boat, the day you buy it and the day you sell it."
stella,"Well, according to my figures that sounds about right, but what can you do?  Beauty is a cruel mistress."
uri,I must remember that line.        Can I pour you a glass?
stella,Not for me thank you.
uri,"You know, I like you. I like the way you...are. Always thinking about business, very professional."
stella,"That's what you pay me to be, isn't it?"
uri,Tell me about your husband.
stella,"My husband is a lawyer. URI I hear he is very good at what he does, maybe we can have some work for him."
stella,"I don't quite know where this is going and if you don't mind, I would like to keep our relationship professional."
uri,"You see Victor, this is what I am talking about. "
stella," Forgive me for being immodest Mr Omovich. I am a very good accountant, but I can only cover so much of your money, it does have to be accounted for after all. It is not easy to lose seven million to the tax man."
uri,"But, if you are so good,...."
stella,"Let me think about it, there are some options I have tried to leave open."
uri,Thank you.
tank,You know why they call me Tank don't you Archy?
archy,"I should imagine it has something to do with you being a dirty great blac,..."
tank,"Think Tank. Nothing gets past the old think Tank Arch, nothing.  You got me thinking, so I fired a few questions into the right direction. Thought I'd better come see you 'cos I got some news 'bout your painting."
lenny cole,"Right, I am going to tell you how this works. You're going in the drink and I am going to make a cup of tea."

handsome bob,"What have I got to cheer up about, I am going to be locked up in an eight by ten tomorrow night."
one two,"But that's tomorrow night, tonight its take off time, we've prepared a little going away party. "
handsome bob," It's not that I am ungrateful One Two, it's just,...."
one two,It's just what?
handsome bob,"Don't worry,..you wouldn't understand."
handsome bob,Would you?
one two,You're me best mate.
handsome bob,"I don't want the strippers One Two,....  I want you,...."
one two,You dirty bastard! I know all your girlfriends all of 'em!
handsome bob," See, I told you you wouldn't understand!"
one two,Understand what? 
handsome bob,"I only told you cos I'm going away, but I should have kept my mouth shut."
one two,"Fuckin right you should have kept your mouth shut, should have drowned the cat instead of letting it out the bag."
one two,"All right Bob, I am sorry.        I went over the top, it was just a       surprise that's all.  Well what is it you want to       do with me?"
drowned sloane,"Johnny, Johnny Story. You know the singer in that group Story Time."
lenny cole,That didn't work did it? How can a dead man sell you a painting?
drowned sloane,"He's not dead, I know he's not dead because he just tried to sell us that picture and changed his mind at the last minute. He's got like an obsession with it."
lenny cole,"Put 'em back Arch, before I shoot 'em."
archy,"Len, could I have a word?    Private,.. it's worth it."
archy,"Your boy's not dead, is he?"
lenny cole, Don't you dare call him my boy.
archy,"Sorry, I mean your boy, the Ex's boy,...your step son. He had a set of keys to the house didn't he?"
lenny cole,He won't die that cockroach. 
archy,Roman and Mickey.
lenny cole,"If anyone can find that smoking crack pipe, it's them."
lenny cole,"Listen to me boy, listen. I never did like you and neither did your real father. You're a reject, a wrong-un, a fuckin fairy in the mirror that I inherited from your mother, but she ain't with us no more, so now it's just you and me. In one week you go back to school, the best fuckin school in the country I might add, then you'll be gone for another term.  In the mean time, show me some gratitude and keep the fuckin music down."
johnny story,"Just couldn't, it's got me,...that's what art does Pete, it gets you."
pete,"You'd get a good few notes for that. Go on John, jog it on."
johnny story,You wouldn't understand.
pete,"Why not? JOHNNY STORY Because,.....You,.... Are street scum Pete."
pete,"Leave off John, what is this shrink time?"
johnny story,"Come on Pedro, share. I'm your sponsor, Doctor,...your dad if you're feeling a bit of regression coming on.  But first we should have a drink in our hands."
pete,My Dad made me watch Bonanza every Sunday after church.
johnny story,"That's got to have done some damage, all those guns and cowboys."
pete,"You think? It wasn't all bad, he sometimes made me laugh too."
johnny story,"Now we're getting somewhere. Did he interfere with you? You know, touch you inappropriate like?"
pete,He tickled me if that's what you mean.
johnny story,"Now that's it! That's what I was looking for, you see your Dad is a monster Pedro, a tickling monster.  Pedro's dad's a tickling monster!"
waster,That's my drink.
pete,"Fuck you singalong, you're no help and stop calling me Pedro."
johnny story,"Come on boy, I'll have you and ya girlfriends! I'll do the lot of yazz."
pete,He hit me bad as well the slag.        Hit with a chain.
johnny story," What are you doing? I'm not going to tickle you Pete, I'm not your Dad."
pete,I used to think it had something to do with Bonanza.
johnny story,"Your dad was jealous. Cos you dad isn't sure he's your dad, cos you don't look like him."
pete,Really?     What do I look like then?
johnny story,"You have all the facial characteristics of North American native, Livapuddlian Indian. "
pete,Really?
archy,Who wanna see you two.
secretary,I'm sorry Mickey.
mickey,"Don't worry about it June, go and have another lunch."
lenny cole,Sorry to intrude.  They call this a lichee don't they? ROMAN I believe so.
lenny cole,"Tasty exotic, bit like your suit."
roman,How can we help?
lenny cole,Don't you have an act called Story Time?
roman,We did.
lenny cole,And isn't there a lead singer called Johnny Story?
roman,There was.
lenny cole,"Well, I would like to see Mr Johnny Story."
roman,"I would like to see him too, but that might be tricky 'cos according to the newspapers the only songs Mr Story is going to be singing is hymns."
lenny cole,"And I shed a tear. I shed it for all those bone tops that read the papers and believe that shit.  No, you didn't did you? And nobody else fuckin did either, did they 'cos he ain't dead. He's alive-alive- o somewhere selling cockles and mussels,...and a very important painting that doesn't belong to him. ROMAN Sorry, but what has this got to do with us?"
lenny cole,"You have twelve licenses within a jurisdiction which I control. You wanna play on, do what I tell you.  Now, I can tell what you're thinking."
roman,That there's not much you can't do?
archy,"Slow down tinker bell, you'll never sing the same if ya teeth aren't your own."
mickey,You gonna take care of him?
lenny cole," What do you think we are, gangsters? That's not my style and especially not with genetics and all,..."
cookie,"Where have you been? You were missed in court today. That's not very compassionate is it, didn't turn up for your amigos funeral."
one two,What are you trying to say Fred?
one two,You wanna have it out now?
handsome bob,Guess whoooo?
one two," Five years, you were supposed to get five fucking years!"
dolly,"One Two there's a woman on the phone for you, she sounds very educated."
one two,How did you get this number?
one two,"One point for initiative, two to tell me what's on your mind."
one two,Let me see what I can do.
one two,"So Bob got off, big fucking deal.  I have a little bit of work for you Cookie we have a party to go to."
uri,You're looking well Lenny.
lenny cole,"Well thank you Uri, that's a real compliment from a man that obviously takes good care of himself."
uri,I suppose you're wondering why you are here?
lenny cole,"I assume you want to check that everything is still ""kosher"" at my end.  I was a little surprised you didn't come through at the appropriate time, but I reckon you have your reasons. Silence."
uri,"I assume everything is still as you say,...Kosher?"
lenny cole,"Don't you worry Uri, that one's on me,...partners and all that, but I wouldn't like it to go south again, makes things difficult, if you know what I mean?"
uri,"I understand Lenny and I wouldn't like things to go wrong either. Which brings me conveniently to my next point. Ever since the painting, my lucky painting, hasn't been hanging on my wall, things have not been,....so lucky. I know this is a rude request because we have not concluded our business, but I feel as though I need it."
archy,"Fuckin hell Len, he's given you that bar tan again. You wanna leave that vodka alone."
lenny cole,Shut up Arch!
archy,Everything all right?
lenny cole,"No it's fuckin not all right, he want's his painting, his lucky painting."
archy,"Oh, I see. That's a bit of a problem then isn't it?"
lenny cole,"You should have seen his eyes I swore they changed color, went fuckin red they did."
archy,"They don't care who's soil they are on that lot. They can buy half the country without breaking a sweat, you're small time to them. They could click their fingers and we'd be ether."
lenny cole,"You speak to me like that again and I'll cut your fuckin tongue out. I run this town, got that, me! Anybody who thinks he's rude enough, let 'em raise a finger, 'cos I'll take off his whole fuckin arm. Do you understand that Archy?  I said do YOU?"
archy,"Yes, I do Len."
mickey,"How about that then, Johnny Story's father? How did that get under the radar? Why doesn't anybody know?"
roman,Would you want anyone to know that he was your Dad? Would we have taken him on if we had known?
mickey,"We're going to have to give him something, anything, a bed that's been slept in, a bone for his dog, some token of effort."
roman,We need to see Cookie.
tom, Who are you?
cookie,My name is Cookie.
tom,You must be with Stella?
cookie,"No, we're with the Grand Old Duke of York."
cookie," This is gonna be a scream, Fred get 'em in."

cookie,"Come on then kids, get in a nice orderly line and we'll get the party started."
one two,What the fuck are you doing here?
handsome bob,"Well all the chaps were coming and I didn't have any plans tonight did I? Thought I might celebrate a little, do you mind?"
one two,"Yes I do fuckin mind. Now listen Bob, what happened last night is our little secret all right and it was only cos you were supposed to be doing your time, right? You tell anybody and I swear to God,.... I swear to God. Well fuck it Bob, I think you understand."
