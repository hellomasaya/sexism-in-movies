Speaker,Dialogue
susan,We'll see...
anchorman,Only after the numbers had reached into the thousands were officials able to identify the carrier of the deadly infection...
director,Cut to three.
anchorman,Blattida Germanica.  The common cockroach.
director, Tell them we're ready for a live feed.
reporter 1,...an insect that has proven virtually immune to chemical control...
reporter 2,...the announcement by the Health Department that an end to the nightmare has finally...
reporter 3,...an ex-colleague of Doctor Susan Wyeth...
protester,"...Susan has always been opposed to biological tampering. A real advocate for ecological causes, it's not..."
peter," ...in Nature, evolution is a long, leisurely conversation between an organism and its environment. We, however, did not have the luxury of time..."
susan,"With the aid of genetic labs throughout the country, we recombined cockroach DNA with genetic information from termites and mantids. We were able to create a biological counter-agent.  A new ally, if you will..."
susan,Blattida Traditor.
susan,"The Judas is a non-carrier of Stricklers, with a short life-span and heightened pheromone emission."
susan,The female is basically a sexual magnet; common males travelled miles and fought for the right to mate with them.
susan,"When they did, they took away something else we added -- a hormone, passed through sexual congress that causes their metabolism to go into overdrive.  No matter what their food intake, they starved to death in a matter of hours."
peter,"We've achieved almost total eradication of the roach population.  As of today, the disease has been officially contained."
peter,Fucking thing! I hope someone's taping this.  Sus?
peter,Life's a bitch. Our 15 minutes came and went and all we got was bad cable...
peter,Hiding from the hard glare of publicity?
peter,A shame.  You looked great tonight.
susan,Please.
peter,You did!
susan,Do you think we did the right thing?
peter,Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
susan,You know what I mean...
susan,We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
peter, Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
peter,You hear that?  Flawless.
susan,We just don't know.
peter,We know we saved lives.
peter,There're gonna be a lot of kids running around next year because of you.
peter,"Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours."
susan," We're down to a ""couple"" now, huh?"
peter,"Oh, I don't know. People are beginning to talk about us..."
susan,"Don't worry, I'll save your honor. Maybe I'll even marry you."
chinese preacher,"No.  Please, God, no!"
chuy," Funny, funny shoes..."
peter,"Excuse me, ladies..."
susan,"...no, guys, these have to fit perfectly.  No spaces in between. Let me tell you why. Insects have no hands. All they have is this set of mandibles."
susan,See?  This little piggy will grab the prey.
susan,Then this little piggy will tear it in half...
susan,...and this little one will grind it to a pulp and push it in... all the way into the mouth.  These are precision tools here. Can you remember that?
susan,Good.  Then get it right.
peter," ""Baby in a bottle..."""
susan,Don't tease.
peter,You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
susan, Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
susan,Trust me. I've never been this late. Never.
susan,If nun's pee is what it takes...
susan,"You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that."
peter,Don't get kinky here...
peter,"Okay, meet me out front.  I gotta go. Josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight."
susan,I'll be late.
susan,"Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions..."
siri," Just like Trump Tower, then."
josh,"...So I say ""buddy, you have every violation in the book.  Gimme one good reason not to close you down."" You know what the Kraut says to me?"
josh,"The blintzes!  ""Try the blintzes..."""
peter, Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
josh,"Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren."
peter,"Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell ""Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"""
josh,Health Department...
peter,"You really love flashing that thing, don't you?"
josh,Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
peter,"Peter Tyler, DOH. You gentlemen were the first on the scene?"
woychek," We were both on patrol, saw this paint mess. Then I looked through that cellar window. We both did..."
peter,You gone in?
woychek,No. We waited.
peter,Good.
peter," Get the EMT's in there, now."
manny,"C'mon Chuy, we're gonna be late.  Cops are bad news. Don't look at them."
peter,Jesus.
woychek," They look real sick, don't they?"
susan,"...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that."
siri,"I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter."
susan," Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here."
siri,"I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah..."
susan,What?
siri,She used a baster.
siri,"Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster."
susan,"Oh, Jesus."
susan,"Come on, darlin'..."
siri," She kept it under her bed. Thing is, it kinda worked.  I mean, she had to hide it from her husband, but..."
susan,What's this?
siri,"Oh, right... They been here since noon. I told them you're real busy."
susan,Hello.
ricky,"You the bug lady, right?"
susan, I suppose so.
ricky,We're here to deal.
susan,"Metaxonycha Godmani, Trigonopelastes Delta.  Field Butterflies.  Have you been upstate?"
davis,Avenue B.
susan, I guess they got lost in this city.
ricky,"So, you wanna buy em?"
davis,There's extra wings in the bag.
susan,You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
ricky, That's it?
davis, Show her the weirdbug.
ricky,Cost a dollar just to look.
davis,It's a great bug.  We kinda broke it a little...
susan,"Fellas, I'll tell you what...ten dollars for everything.  Plus a killing jar, some tweezers and mounts so the next bunch you catch will be in better shape."
davis,Deal!
ricky,You crazy! That's the best!!
davis,Bug's almost dead anyway.
davis,"Thanks, lady."
siri,Ten dollars?
susan,Alphabet City kids- there's much worse things they could be selling.
siri,I hate this fucking window...
peter," There's plenty of systemic infection already, so as soon as we get a preliminary reading, start them on anti-biotics. You saw this?"
peter,"Internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it.  No definite signs of TB, but we'll quarantine them a week just to make sure."
josh,Immigration's gonna love you for that.
peter,Tell them to send flowers to the usual address.
josh,"Two shifts, people rotating from bed to work.  One toilet. We're in Wal-Mart hell, here."
peter,Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
josh,"Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him."
peter,Tell her she's going to be alright. We'll take care of her.
yang,"She's delirious.  Keeps saying the ""Dark Angels"" are coming for her. She says they took some of her people away."
peter,Dark Angels?
yang," Probably a gang.  Chinese people, man. They come up with some wacky stuff."
susan,Siri?  Siri?!
siri,...the fuck?
susan, Can you...?
susan, Could you...help me...?
susan,"I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?"
siri,What is it?
susan,I have no idea.  Are you ready?
siri,Oh my God...
siri,Shit!! Get it!  Get it!
susan, It bit you.
siri,No shit.
susan,This wing configuration. I've never...
siri, Fuck! It broke the skin...
susan,And they're not fully developed.  This thing's not even an adult.
susan,My God.
siri,What?
siri,That's impossible.  Insects don't...
susan,I know.  Help me get a sample.
susan,"Hold on, big guy, hold on..."
susan,Hold on a second...
siri,What?
susan,Call security.
manny,"Not too little, not too much. You rub it in, around and around like this. Let the leather take it."
manny,You watching? You should learn to work the shoes. You're good with your hands...
manny,Chuy...you gonna get all wet.
manny,Did you look at the story book I got you?
manny,"Our Animal Friends.  Can you say that, Chico?  ""Friends""?"
manny,In this city. A friend is a hard thing to find...
chuy,Funny Shoes...
chuy,Alli.  Mr. Funny Shoes.
manny,No one is there. Is empty.
manny,"Chuy, listen to me.  They have Jesus on the cross, but that is not a holy place. You understand?"
manny,"Ah, Nino.  God only knows what goes on in your head, eh?"
chuy,Mr. Funny Shoes...
peter,"Josh, what was Immigration's countdown?"
josh,Thirty-three workers.
peter,There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
josh,Shit.
peter,"Remember what that woman said, about people being taken? Check with the copsin the area."
peter,Sus?
peter, Susan?
peter, Thought it was my week for that.
susan, I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
susan,"This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!"
peter,Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
susan,Don't you get it? It's more than that.
susan,You know why insects don't grow larger? Because they don't have a complex respiratory system. What I saw did. It had lungs.
susan,Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
peter,We?
susan,I did a PH test on its tarsal pads.
susan,There's only two species who match the enzymes I found.  One's a leaf-cutter ant in the Amazon...
susan,The other we released here two years ago.
armenian driver,"Avenue B... again! Maybe you got wrong letter, uh?"
susan,Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
peter,Maybe they lied to you.
susan,"Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?"
armenian,"No... Oh, shit. Get away, you Turk!"
susan,Pull over!
armenian driver,What...?
susan,Metaxonycha Godmani.
peter,So?
susan,We're here to deal.
peter,"Here, let me..."
susan,You sure you didn't see one of these?
ricky,Gross. What is it?
susan,"An ""Ootheca"". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh ""weirdbugs"" inside."
ricky," No way. I see one of those, I'd puke."
davis,It was in that corner over there.
ricky,"Sucker was fast, man.  Had to take it out with one a these."
peter,"Okay, guys.  We'll take it from here."
ricky,Make it ten an' we won't tell the cops you're here.
peter,Let's keep it at five and I won't condemn your clubhouse.
peter," Look, a broken tooth..."
susan,There's something under here.
peter,Shit.
susan,Let me try.  My hands are smaller.
peter,"Honey, just leave it."
susan,"No, there's..."
leonard, Now don't tell me.
peter,"Look, I showed you my badge..."
leonard,"Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks..."
peter,The Department of Public Health...
leonard,...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
peter,Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
leonard,Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
ernest,Your shoes.
susan, That's wonderful!  What grade are you in?
ernest,No school. Shoes're all Chuy knows about.
manny, He's special.
leonard,"He can imitate anything, you just watch him."
peter," Excuse me, I'm talking to you."
leonard,"No, you talkin' at me."
ernest, Is there some reward for this?
susan,I guess that could be arranged.
peter,"For Chrissakes.  You gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?"
leonard,"You wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude."
peter,You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
susan,I heard how you talked to him.
peter,"Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?"
susan,He was just doing his job.
peter,"Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!"
peter,"He wants a permit, I'll get him a permit."
ernest,Chrissakes...
ernest,"Guys, c'mon."
ernest,I told you to stick by the maintenance area.
bag lady,Nah... It's private property now.
skeletal bum,He eats down there.
ernest,Who?
homeless man,The Stickman.
bag lady,Long John.
ernest,"Graffiti artist, uh?  Look guys, just get off my beat, you hear?  Get moving."
ernest,"Hey, buddy!"
ernest,Get off my track...
ernest,Sweet Jesus...
peter,Heya.  Where's the boss?
siri,Ant mound.
peter,You okay?
siri,It's just a headache.  We were sandblasting Trump Tower here since four this morning.
peter,Maybe you should sit...
siri,I'm fine. Go talk to Susan.  She could use a good word right now.
peter,Great crowd.
susan,"No such thing, baby."
susan,I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
peter,Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
susan, Right.
peter,What's wrong?
susan,Oh...nothing that a little menopausal's pee daikiri couldn't cure. Least that's what I thought.
peter," Oh, no, you were-"
susan,I was just late.
susan,"Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are..."
peter,"Susan, we're not b-"
siri, I'm sorry.  I think...I need...
susan,Siri...
susan,Siri!
peter,"...I think it's some kind of systemic infection, Chris.  I saw a few cases like it yesterday. A sweatshop in Canal."
raymond," Okay, look.  You better come in with me.  Help me through."
raymond," All hands on deck, Pete. Remember the dril?"
peter,It'll come back to me.
peter,Looks like a Lyme disease rash.
raymond,It's not consistent with the internal bleeding. Any idea what bit her?
raymond,I think we're gonna need to have that specimen here.
chuy,Mr. Funny Shoes.
susan,...you don't even know what you're looking for.
peter,You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
susan,Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
peter,No.
peter,"Susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as Siri..."
susan,It didn't bite me.
peter,I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
peter,Chris is going to run some blood tests on you.  I want you to stay here till he's absolutely sure you're clean.  Okay? Then you'll call me... You'll catch up with us...
peter,"We'll be all right, Sus.  I promise."
manny,"My father saw me stay in bed, he'd go get a pitcher. Cold water, whoosh, I tell you that's some alarm clock, brrrrr!"
manny,"Ah! There you go! The way you like 'em, Chu-chu...  We're low on milk, you remind Grampa to pick some up tonight, okay?"
workman,Hold up!  We gotta block on filter D.
workman,"Oh, God..."
control booth,VOICE What's the problem?
workman,I think it's a baby!
raymond,How you feeling?
susan,You tell me.
raymond,Your blood tests were all negative. You checked out.
susan,What about Siri?
raymond,"She's stable.  I don't think there's any immediate danger, but we'll have to keep her under observation..."
susan,"You think it's some form of Strickler's, don't you?"
raymond,"Pathology's still working on the tissue samples.  If it is...it must be an errant strain.  Shorter incubation period.  I'm sorry, Sue.  We just don't know yet."
jeremy,Take it out back and throw it in the friggin' dumpster!
emt,Not unless somebody signs for it.
susan,"Oh, my God."
jeremy,"Hey, you can't..."
susan,What's your name?
jeremy,Jeremy...
susan,"Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?"
jeremy,Lady...
susan,Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
jeremy,Okay.
susan, Where'd you find it?
emt,Washed up at the filtration plant on Bank street. Some asshole there thought it was a baby. They called us.
emt,"It's a lobster, right?"
leonard,"Better hurry it up, Doc. My shift's almost over."
peter,Guess someone requested you for overtime...buddy.
susan,Posterior sternites are gone...half the protonum rotted off.
raymond,Maggots...
susan,Near hatching.  Thing must've died about three weeks ago.
susan,Do you have a polaroid?
leonard,"You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up."
josh, New York's finest.
josh,There's really people living down here?
leonard,"Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street..."
leonard,"Substance abusers, mental cases... Then about a year ago, Poof! All gone. Rumors got started... Someone found a couple of stiffs..."
leonard,"Down here's the land of talk, see? So the wildest version goes the farthest. They mark that area with a sign or a drawing, and its as good as closed.  We had one fella... for years said he was Bela Lugosi. Got him on Geraldo."
susan,It's me. Can you hear me?
peter," Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing..."
susan,I have.
susan,I'm on my way. I've got something for you to look at...
peter,We'll be back at the platform in...
leonard,20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
peter, Susan?
leonard,Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
josh,What?
leonard,Track bunnies.  Rats.  They're usually around.
manny,"No, no, please understand... I can't wait that long."
manny,"Please. I write it down.  2... 8... 7... 3. What does this mean ""case number""? Okay. So, now what?  When can you...?"
manny,"No, I can't wait...no, listen..."
manny,Hijos de puta.
manny,Mr. Funny Shoes.
josh, Smells like acid.
peter,Ammonia.
josh,Peter...
peter,Yeah...?
josh,There's some weird shit here.
peter,Weird shit...?
josh,Take a look.
josh,"Fecal matter, unknown origin: weird shit.  Whatever it is, it's not human."
leonard,And it needs some metamucil.
manny,Chuy...
manny,Chuy...
repairman,"Hey, Lady, all power will be down in five minutes, okay?"
susan,Okay....
susan,Peter?
leonard,I've never been this deep. This area here is the Old Armory station. They built it in the 40's. Ran out of money half-way through...
leonard,"Okay, the fat lady's singing. Time to go."
peter,Don't!!
leonard,Did you see the size of that thing?!
peter,Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
josh,Peter!
peter,It's okay.  I'm all right.
leonard,Get the hell away from me!
peter," He's all right, too."
leonard,"Oh, that's gonna work."
peter,You got a better way up?
leonard, Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
josh,H-how do I get...?
leonard,Way we came.  Take the first tunnel to your right...
josh,"I think so. One right, two lefts..."
leonard,And a right.
josh,Right.
peter,Go Josh. Now.
susan,HELP!!!
josh,"Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!"
peter,Any luck?
leonard,"Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead."
peter,You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
leonard,"Oh, man, there you go again."
peter,What?
leonard,Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
peter,"For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?"
leonard,"All right, motherfucker, that's it."
peter,Shh! Shh!
leonard, Manny?!
leonard,"My God, what the hell are you...?"
manny,"Hurry, the woman needs help!"
peter,Woman?
susan, Don't.
peter,Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
peter, Give me your belts.
leonard, What are you doing down here?
manny,"Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her."
peter,What's...?
manny,Just hurry.
peter,"I'm coming, Sus, I'm coming."
susan,"No, Jesus, no."
peter, Toss the flare down!
leonard,I only got...
peter,Just do it!
peter,"Oh, Jesus..."
leonard,What the fuck is that?! What the fuck is that?!
susan, Peter...
peter,Wrap it around your hand!
peter,Come on!
peter,Get on my shoulders!
peter,Let's go!
peter,"Oh, shit..."
manny,There!
leonard,Get the goddam door!
peter,Push it! Push it! Don't let up!
leonard,What the fuck was that?
leonard,You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
manny,"Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!"
peter, We don't know!! We don't know what it is!
peter,Wait a minute-
leonard,"Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-"
leonard,GET IT!  GET IT OFF ME!
peter,Its muscles are locked.
leonard," Oh, Jesus!!"
manny,Wait...
leonard,"Oh, Jesus! It's hitting the bone man, get it off!!"
peter, Hey hey hey...
manny,Is how we make loose the ticks back home.
peter,Just keep holding it.  Can you do that for me?  Susan?
peter,You feel anything?
leonard,"Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out..."
peter,"Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here..."
leonard,"Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?"
peter,I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
manny,Where the hell'd that thing come from?
peter, A mistake.
leonard,"""Mistake""?  What's that supposed to...?"
peter,"It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead."
leonard,"How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart..."
susan, It doesn't have a heart.
susan,Just inner chambers...
manny,But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
susan,No...
susan,That's what it wanted you to see.
peter,"So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or..."
susan, That's camouflage...
susan,This is mimicry. They evolve to mimic their predators. A butterfly can look like the eyes of an owl.  A catterpillar can copy a snake...
susan,This has evolved to mimic the most dangerous predator it's ever had...
susan,Us.
susan,Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
manny," ""...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."""
susan,"This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?"
susan,"All these...they're like tunnels of an insect colony. Once these things hit a certain population density, they'll have to move out, form new colonies."
susan,We have to get help down here.  Burn the tunnels before...
leonard,Get the doors!
peter,Is there a switch?
leonard,Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
susan, The lights!
leonard, Where's the damn crank?!
peter, They're coming!
susan,I got it!
susan,Hurry! Please!
leonard,"Come on, you son-of-a..."
susan,"Oh, God.  The blood..."
susan,His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
peter,How?!
peter,It's no use! They know we're in here!
susan,"They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!"
peter,Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
susan,Exac...
susan, Give me your razor.
peter,What are you doing?
leonard, Shit!
susan,Rub it on the windows!
peter,What-
susan,Just do it!!
leonard,What are you putting that crap on me for?
susan,Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
leonard,This track we're on? Goes down into the repair area.  The elevator's over here. Leads up to the active tunnels.
peter,Can we get this car there?
leonard,"Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator."
susan,But the power...
leonard,"Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables..."
manny,"Oh, how you gonna get there, Leonard? Hop?"
peter, Just talk me through it. I can go with Manny.
leonard,It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
susan,"Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!"
peter,We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
susan,Peter-
peter,It worked before...
susan, The scent won't last...
peter,That's why we should do it now.
leonard,"It's just a regular old pump switch, okay? Right by the track signal board."
leonard,"The lights come up, you pull the switch."
manny,I pull.
leonard,"You don't do that, we're on the wrong track.  You..."
leonard,You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
peter,Depends.  You got a memo?
leonard,All right then.  You gonna find two wires.  One's green.  The other's blue...
manny,He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
susan,Manny...
manny,"I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy..."
susan,We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
susan,You're going to have to keep it really slow.  Their eyes react to sudden movements.
susan,"Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes..."
peter,Try not to sweat?
leonard,"Okay, people..."
leonard,"Whatever you do, don't step on the third rail coming back. Six hundred volts'll blow your leg right off."
peter,I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
susan, That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
peter,In the tool box under the kitchen counter...
susan,Open it.
susan,"Choke on it, motherfuckers."
peter, Green...Blue...
manny,Chuy...?
manny, Nino...
manny,Chuy...
peter,Dammit!
susan, The scent's fading...
leonard, What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
manny,"Nino, please..."
manny,Dios mio...
manny, Chuy...
chuy, Friends.
manny,"NO, NO, CHUY, NO..."
chuy,Friends.
manny,"God has closed his eyes. This, he cannot see..."
susan,Over here! Over here! Goddam you!!
susan, THE DOOR! OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!
peter,Manny...
susan,Peter!!
