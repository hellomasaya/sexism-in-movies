Speaker,Dialogue
narrator,"To most of America in 1913, the Age of Innocence had arrived and the stories of the Indian Wars and the Gold.RuSh and the Great Gunfighters had become either barroom ballyhoo or front-porch remiraiscences... .But on both sides of the $io Grande men still lived as thia7 had in the 1 70's and 1 80's -- unchanged. men in a changing land. THEY WEAR THE KHAKI UNIFORMS OF THE UNITED STATES CnVALJRY.. The horses bear the government brand and the saddles are regulation. PIKE BISHOP,. wearing lieutenant's bars, rides slightly ahead of the others. He rides stiffly; always slightly in pain... Pike is a not unhandsome, leather-faced man in his early forties. A thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant for violence who is afraid of nothing - except the. changes in himself and those around him. Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero -- his values are not ours -- he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank. robber, a killer of men. His sympathies are not for fences, for trolleys.and telegraphs or better schools. He lives outside and against society because he believes in that way of life and if he has moments of sympathy for others, moments of regret, t hey ' are short lived. He is not a 'good man' according to the righteous... To them he is totally bad, and he wouldn't have it any other way. Next to him DUTCH ENGSTROM wears the uniform of a sergeant. Dutch is big good-natured with a fast gun hand, strong loyalty and, like Pike, a bone deep distaste for rules and regulations. He can sing,. has more than his share of charm, but believes in nothing except two men, and Pike is one. Behind them ride two brothers, LYLE and TECTOR GORCH, dressed as corporals. Lyle and Tector are big, tough, hot tempered and sudden. They work together, eat together and"
dutch,Make you feel welcome?
tec tor,What's it say?
angel," It invites us to stay with the community and grow. It is here, perhaps with time and small miracle -- that you could be taught to read."
tector,I never enlisted to serve with no smart-mouthed kid.
angel,Nor I with dogs.
dutch, ITd like to transfer to another unit -- there seems to be dissension in the ranks.
pike," Itll transfer both of you -- just one more word. They look at him silently. He means it. Finally Tike spurs his horse and the group sta'ts for town, CAMERA PANNING. THEM PAST. THE STATt.ON AM BOXCARS into a side street."
pike,"(after a moment, a little"
buck,"Real quiet, 'sir.' Pike looks at the horses, then at:"
pike," Beg pardon, Ma'am."
dutch," Let. me, Ma'am. Dutch picks up the package, Pike offers the lady his arm. She hesitates, accepts. Pike and Dutch, followed by the others, lead her across the 'street."
harrigan,Pike?
thorn ton," He's there. The bounty hunters react and prepare to fire. Over this shot is the sound of Pike calling to Thornton -- from the past. 19 PIKE REACHES THE DOOR AND WITHOUT PAUSING, murmurs 'goodbye' to the lady and enters, followed by the others, 20 ON THE ROOF, HARRIGAN WHIRLS ON HIS MEN as they begin aim- ing, ready to fire.."
harr igan,That's all we needed:
paymaster,"What -you meant to do does not interest me What you did -- Then, seeing: 24 PIES AND THE OTHERS waiting, he steps to the ody window, smiling with the thought that their visit means. military business for the railroad. His mood. changes as the men draw their\guns and Pike steps towards him."
pike,"If they move, kill them. C.L. grins happily and squats on the floor, his 12 gauge pump shotgun angled up at:"
earrigan,Damn them! The parade moves toward the saloon.
harri gan,"Told-what!? Sus t how. long do you think anyone in this manure pile can keep his mouth shut? Before Thornton can answer: 30 T..C.. SHIFTS TO CHANGE POSITION and his hand. touches the tin roof, ,causing him to.yelp with pain.. The others snap a look in his. direction, then freeze as: 31 'VECTOR ON THE BOARDWALK. LOOKS UP,. SEES NOTHING, leans back against a rail watching the horses and the hymn singers. After a moment, he smiles a little, beating time,. as he remembers some forgotten march he watched from his daddy's shoulders."
margaret,Trash -- Filthy trash!
angel,People marching and singing coming down the street -- going to pass near the horses.
angel,"Rifles -- one -- no three,. maybe more, on the roof."
pike,Waiting for us
dutch,How in hell could they have known we were coming?
pike,How in hell do I know?
dutch,Where do we go?
pike,"No, son -- we got company there too --  -Besides, when I travel, I like my feet to dangle."
pike, No. You just hold them here and wait as long as you can -- after the shooting starts.
coffer,"Well, just dig it out and see. if it ain't my,... 06 S"
harri gan, You stupid damn fools! ... How could you shoot this employee and let the others get away?
coffer," He's lying'. Him and them others was shootin' that old 'employee' full of holes while I was droppin' this bandit and them others too -- I must've killed all three of 'em, sir, while --"
thornton, Harrigan:.. He shot the old an -
benson,We're holding you -- your whole damned rail- road responsible for this carnage --
harrigan,Mr. Benson...o
wainscoat," Innocent people are dead ...women mangled -- dying --because you used our town as a battlefield; You're going to pay, sir -- your-railroad is going to pay for our blood;"
harrigan," Without the railroad this place would still be a lousy little pueblo, so don't make any threats to me;"
benson, You can't ambush innocent people. on our street!
harrigan,We represent the law!
harrigan,I pulled. you out of jail to get- that bunch -- and you failed --
harrigan,What.makes you think there'll be a next time for you? What makes you think you're not going back behind bars for twenty more years? Thornton's face twists as he hears again the clanging of cell doors and the whimpering of prisoners..
thornton,Because I'm all you've got  Because you know I'll get him -- I'll kill him rather than go-back.
harri gan,Twice .he' s made a fool of me - He never will again.  You know why you're here -- (before Thornton can
tho rnton, IT 11 get him -- you have my word.
angel,"Fijate. 94 BUCK, ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES, MOANS WITH PAIN as he attempts to crawl up the slope. 95 PIKE RIDES DOWN TO HIM,. SWINGS OFF EIS HORSE and stands looking down."
buck," Finish it, Mr. Bishop."
pike, You boys want to move on -- or stay here and give him a 'decent burial'.?
tector," Well,. he was a good man --"
lyle,Too damn many.
lyle," Crazy bastards -- both of you l Tector follows his brother, cursing.. 101 PIKE AND DUTCH LOOK AT EACH OTHER silently -- try to grin -- finally make it -- then follow. The bunch is attentive, but now certain that they are not being closely followed, they can relax a little.. Pike and Dutch are side by side."
lyle, Old friends?
dutch,Deke Thornton.
lyle,I thought he was your partner?
dutch,'He changed -- you didn't.'
pike,"- You.sound like you're all caught up,"
thornton,Caught up enough to know we've overstayed our welcomes
pike, What in hell is the matter with you?
elizabeth,"Stay -- please,"
thornton,"How can you be. so damned sure? He shakes off the girl, crosses to a sideboard, pours a drink.."
deputy,"Get him? The man shakes his head. 101-G THORNTON, HIS FACE TWISTED WITH PAIN AND BITTERNESS, makes no attempt to struggle as he .is pulled to his feet and moved out the door."
pike,"He's had five years on the r ck pile, Dutch -- and twenty more to u go -- that.can hurt a man."
lyle, Say -- I've heard it's like the.old times in Argentina...3utch Cassidy down. there making a killing...
pike,Fo -- but he takes a dim view of 20 more years in the Carcel --
thornton,"Tell me, Mr. Harrigan.-- how does it feel?  -Getting paid to sit back and hire your killings with the law's arms around you? How does it feel to be so damned right;?"
harr igan," Good, Mr..Thornton...it feels good."
harrigan," Use them -- lead them -- get Pike -- then kill them off. When you come back, I: want all of them head down over a saddle. (pointing to the bunkhouse"
lyle,What's so 'lindo about it.
change, 2/12/68  22.  INT. RAILROAD BUNKHOUSE - DAY
harrigan,The hard money value of the men killed less my commi.sson amounts to. one hundred and fifty dollars. 104 THE MEN MUMBLE AND SHIFT. Harrigan holds up four wanted posters. The bounty hunters move closer for a better look.
harrigan,"Bishop... .Engstrom... .Lyle and Tector Gorch...are worth a total of four thousand five hundred dollars -- and you let them all ride outs  Any one'of these pelts would not only clear you with the company,.but would mean a bundle of cash to raise hell with. Harrigan stands, crosses to the door."
harrigan,"There won't be any tonight -- you move after them in ten minutes -- . But if one of you quits on me I'll pay a thousand dollar bonus to the man who kills him. 105 THE MEN SILENTLY BEGIN TO PACK THEIR BELONGINGS. Harrigan motions to Thornton, then exits."
harrigan,Why should I let you go with them?
harrigan,"You could just ride off -- even join him again -- you'd like that, wouldn't .you?"
thornton,What I like and what I. need are two different things.
harr igan,All right..
thornton,I need good men: You saw what happened today.
harrigan,We'll -see what it's worth -- five minutes.
tector,Just more of Texas as far as I'm concerned.
angel,You have no eyes. And he rises ahead with Pike and'Dutch across the tracks into Mexico.
thornton, V All rightt... .How many of you killed this one?
coffer,I knowed I wounded' three -- but I wasn't sure about --
thornton,(as the others yell in
thornton,This pelt should clear you up -- take him back to town...and tell Harrigan to get me a list of every Army garrison and payroll schedule on the border.  We got another half hour of light and they might be just up ahead counting their money.
sykes,Them others ain't comin'?
pike,No.
sykes," None of 'em? 111 PIKE TAKES THE BAGS OUT OF THE CORRAL TO THE FIRE that burns near an adobe wall and drops them on a poncho, watches as the others do the same."
sykes, But I got horses and gear for all them fellers like you said --
pike,"They won't need them -- we will. Sykes thinks this over, finally nods. a little and turns away. 115 LYLE AND HIS BROTHER AND DUTCH STAND in a half. circle around the poncho. waiting. Angel, the last, drops his saddle bag, then crosses to the wall and drops down to rest. For a long moment the men look down.a-t the pile of saddle bags."
lyle,About the sharing up...
lyle,(whining; pointing to
tector,"And I figure a 'share to that old man for watching the horses is a share too much. ll& PIKE TAKES A KNIFE OUT OF HIS BELT, opens a saddle bag,. takes out a sack of silver, kneels to slit the bag open."
lyle,"You hear me, Pike? -- I said it ain't fair... Pike stands,. flips the knife into the ground, faces the brothers."
pike," Well,..why don't you answer me, you dapnned yellow.-livered trash? The brothers fide, et., look at each other."
lyle,"Ah.--' Pike, you know..."
pike, I don't know a damned thing except I either lead this bunch or I end it -- right now;
lyle,"No, sir -- we divide just as you say. Pike looks at them a moment, then picks up his knife and alicea open a bag and -turns it upside down and dumps the contents onto the spread-out poncho watching as:"
tector,"Rings:, Steel rings!"
pike, Son of a bitch! 121 LYLE'S BOOT FLASHES INTO THE PILE. The washers fly in all directions. Lyle whirls on Pike.
lyle,Washers...we shot our way out of that town for a dollar's worth of steel holes. He kicks into the pile and scatters Washers across the clearing.
pike,They set it up:
lyle,. Who the hell is 'they!!?
sykes," Caught you, didn't they? Tied a tin can to your tail -- didn't they? Lead you in and waltzed you out -- Oh my what a bunch -- big tough ones -- standing around with a handful of holes -- a thumb up your ass and a big grin to pass the time of day with. 122 TECTORSWINGS AT HIM, BUT THE OLD MAN DUCKS, then falls and rollsaway, still laughing. Tector starts'to follow, Pike stepsbetween them."
pike,Railroad men -- Pinkertons -- bounty
sykes, Deke Thornton? -- He was with. them?
lyle,(as Pike doesn't answer;
angel,". Hey, gringo; You take my share."
angel,"Don't kill me, gringo ...por favor... Take my share of the 'silver' -- but"
pike,",k for it I Tector-, looking at Angel's gun, half turns to Pike."
dutch, What's our next move?
pike,Agua Verde is the closest three days maybe -- then we sell the extra stock -- get some griib and the news and drift back to the border -- maybe a payroll -- maybe abank --
tec tor,That railroad sire bsi hell ain't getting 4ny easier.
lyle, All your fancy planning and talk damn near got us shot to pieces for.some lousy bags of washers... Now this was goin.' to be our last job before we head south ...We spent all our time and money getting ready for this.
lyle, He --.he was making plans while me and Tector was -- He breaks up and can't continue.
dutch," By two -- mind you, two -- Hondo whores -- while Pike's dreaming of washers - you're matching two of them -- in tandem And the wild bunch falls apart in laughter -- even Pike is caught, but as he laughs, he knows that they are together again."
thornton,Not close enough... They're across the border by now. -
coffer,Deke - you rode with. Pike -- what kind of a man are we up against?
thornton, The best --
fess,How was it -- then mm  You know -- in the old days? I only come out here last spring.
thornton, You can saddle up or shut up -- take your choice --
coffer," ""What will he do?"
thornton,That's what I have to figure.
coffer,Maybe they'll split up.
thornton,No -- not 'that. bunch. They'll try again. - -
pike,Didn't you run some kind of mine -- in Sonora?
dutch,"Yeah, I helped run a little copper -- nothing for us there except day wages, if it was running now -- which it ain't."
pike,"Why in the hell, did you ever quit it?"
dutch,Why in hell are you still goin'?
pike,"I don.'t know""any better -- maybe don't want any better,  Hell, I wouldn't know what to do with 'better' if it poked me.in the eye with a sharp stick."
dutch, You -never gave it :a chance9 Pike.
dutch,"You got a halfway hard mouth, partner."
pike,"What in hell do you want me to-say ,-?"
dutch,"Just don't give me, no lectures.. They are silent -- finally:"
dutch,Back off to what?  Any real ideas for a next one? Pike closes his eyes and leans back.
pike,Pershing. has. got men spread over the whole border. Everyone of those garrisons is going to be.gptting payroll.
dutch,That kind of information is kind of. rough to come by.
pike," Well -- I don't figure it's going to .be easy, but it can be done."
pike,"I wouldn',t have it any other way."
coffer,Why not ?..
thornton,He'll be back.
coffer,Harrigan ' said something about thirty days --
thornton," That's what he said,"
dutch,You must have hurt that railroad pretty bad -- they spent a lot of time and money getting that ambush set up for us.
pike," Well, I caught up to them -- two or three times -- There was a man named Harrigan -- He had a certain way of doing things -- So I made him change his ways -- when you do that to a narrow man -- he can't live with it - from then on he's got to change you -- break you -- just to prove he's.right -- there-'s a hell of a lot of people, Dutch -- that just can't stand to be wrong."
dutch,"Pride, I guess"
pike,I guess -- but they can't ever forget it -- that pride that being wrong or learn by it.
dutch, And you -- and me --did we learn -- being wrong today?
dutch,Where'd you find him?
pike,". That toothless old wreck was a real gun about twenty years back -- used to run with Thornton and me killed his share and more -- around ----Langery -- Ambushed stages all along that old board highway.,.He had those Swede immigrants so scared theyQd starve rather than go to town and by beans for their kids, and there wasn't a sheriff in. the territory to take issue -- He laughs, drinks the coffee and gags.."
dutch," - Pike, I wouldn?t have it no other -way aither."
pike,Leave him alone!
pike," If you can't do that you're worse than some animal -- you're finished -- we're finished -- all of us! Tector looks at him silently. 148 PIKE TURNS TO MOUNT THE HORSE. Placing his foot in the stirrup he stiffly starts to swing on. The leather breaks and. he falls under the animal. Landing on his back, he lets out a loud shriek."
lyle,Riding with 'Brother Pike' and old .man Sykes makes a man wonder if it ain't time to pick up his chips and-find another game.
tector," How in hell are you going to side any- body if you can't get on a horse. 152 PIKE LOOKS AT THEM, THEN STEPS onto the makeshift stirrup and mounts, concealing his pain, taking a few seconds to gather up the reins and position himself. In the b.g., Dutch swings onto his horse."
pike,"Were about two hours from the Santa Caterinas. He turns and rides toward the mountains, the men following."
sykes,That was a mighty fine talk you gave the boys 'bout stickin' to- gether. (as Pike doesn't
pike,We started together -- we'll end it together.
sykes,"By God, that's the way I see it -- that's the way it's always been with me...Sorry 'bout Deke - never figured him that way,  Back in. San. Rafael -- my boy how' d. he do? They ride for a while in silence as: Pike. thinks this over, finally:. _"
pike,Your boy2
sykes,"C.L. -- Clarence Lee -- my daughter's boy ---not too bright, but a good boy -- He handle higself all right? -- I told him -- you do -- just what Mister Bishop says -- Did he conduct hisself well?"
pike, He did fine --
sykes,"Well, you had enough on your mind He had to pull his weight just like the rest of us -- just wanted to know he didn't let you down -- run. when things got hot --"
pike, No ---he did fine...just fine.
coffer,That culvert -- good place for them ----to make an ambush.
thornton,"Go on - ride up and find out. Coffer hesitates, his -ayes wide with fear. Thornton draws his gun, pulls back the hammer."
thornton," Next time I want advice from any of you scum I'll ask for it -- until then, keep . your mouths shut and do what y-ou' re to ld%"
coffer," All clear""'--"
coffer,"From here on, its Mexico, Mr, Thornton."
thornton,What's the closest town of any size2
thornton,What's in Agua Verde?
coffer,"Mexicans -- what else.  Headquarters for Huerta regulars. fighting Obregon, led by an old time bandit named Mapache. Thornton thinks about this, then mounts and rides back in the direction they have come from."
coffer,Don't-we follow?
thornton,No -- we wait.
thornton,'Twenty-eight days.
dutch," We're not going to find much down here., That damned Huerta' s scraped it clean."
angel, My village is up there ...in those mountains.
pike,So --?
angel,I wish to visit my f amily...I can do it and meet you in Agua Verde a day of ter you get there.
pike,How?
angel,"Going this way, you will. have to turn east when you get south of the range... I-know the way to cross the mountains."
dutch,If you know a shorter way..': show us. Angel looks away and is silent for several seconds.
pike,Ashamed of having us meet your people?
pike,"Far as Ifm concerned, you can go,"
lyle,"(dismounting, joining"
dutch,That sounds right to me..
pike,Looks like I'm outvoted.
pike,Wants to visit his folks alone -- thinks we're a little rank for his people.
lyle, I think he can go straight to hell.
tector,Probably wants to get a bunch of his _people and waylay us!
dutch,"And take what? Tector thinks this over, doesn't answer."
pike, How do' you want it?
angel," Any violence -- any disrespect -- and I will. kill you. Tector and Lyle look at him without expression for a moment, then:."
lyle,You got a sister?
angel,...Yes.
lyle,"I would be proud to.make her acquaint- ance -- and. that of your Mama, too."
tector," And your Grandmaw too, sonny... Angel looks at them, then mounts, rides toward the mountains"
thornton,"You have something to say? Coffer instantly lifts his hands in submission and shakes his head. Then, after a moment:"
coffer,"They say Freddy Sykes is with them -- you rode with the old man, didn't you, Mr. Thornton -- you and Pike and the old man? But Thornton rides on and doesn't answer."
carmen,"Miha -- trigame auga.por los frijolesl The girl jumps to her feet, hands both men a bucket ,"
pike,Hard to believe.
don jose,Not so hard -- we all dream of being a-child again -- even the worst of us -- perhaps the worst most of all..
pike," You know us, then --"
don jose,"I know myself only -- where I have been, what I have done."
pike,"Like to ride with us, old man? And for a moment, the old man's eyes flash as he watches: 162- DUTCH AND THREEVILLAGERS SHOEING a very small, very mean 16L. mule. All four have been drinking a little and are thoroughly enjoying themselves as is the mule as he pitches and knocks them all sprawling.."
don jose,"-- I am too old. (almost cursing, indicating"
sykes,"Hell, you ain't so old; partner."
don jose,They were many -- who shot -- your father resisted like a man and died like a man -- names in this matter have no importance.  I lie -- I ran --
sykes,Joe --'by God I like you. I like a man who tells the truth.
don jose, Mapache.
angel,That is.name enough.
pike,The Federal. troops they don? t. protect you --
icon jose,"They were Federal troops; -- commissioned by the traitor Huerta -- seven of the village were killed --.our horses and cattle and corn stolen -- all in the name of Huerta, the killer of our President Francisco I.. Madero -- In Mexico, Senor - these are the years of sadness."
angel,"(after a long moment,"
don jose,Gone.
don jose,"No -- she went with them because she wished to. She became the woman of Mapache -- and others -- she went with them laughing -- Drunk with wine and love. Angel, knowing it's true, turns and moves away. Pike looks after him.'"
don jose,To him she was a goddess. To be wor- shipped from afar -- with music and flowers -- a deity to be followed and adored at a dis -nee but Mapache -' knew she was a mango -- ripe and waiting...
pike,-So Angel lives with a dream -- while Mapache eats the mango --
don jose,Just so -
pike,Many times -- and with the mango too.
pike,"I never could carry a candle to you, old timer."
don jose," And. which do you prefer, the dream or the taste?"
pike,I dream when I sleep -- and eat when I'm hungry.
don jose, Just so  -- the both of you and Map-ache and I --
angel,Where is Mapache?;
thornton,"Ride ahead, all of you. And they do, riding toward Harrigan as we.,"
don jose,"Why do you wish to know -- for your father - or the whore? Pike looks up as Angel fights within himself to find an answer,"
angel,"As you say, Jefe - to Agua Verde and 'our business.'"
dutch,All soldiers - not a bounty hunter in sight.
pike,"We'll go. have a drink, then try and sell the horses."
sykes,'Who'.s going to buy -- looks to me like. this place has been picked clean.
angel, He's been here; 186 THE HORSES PUT THEIR EARS BACK and whinny nervously as an incredible noise is heard off scene. The men snap their heads.around and look at:
pike,I seen one just like this in Waco...
lyle,Run on steam?
pike,No...alcohol:...or gasoline. 190 FREDDY SYKES EDGES UP CLOSE TO PIKE. He is anxious to make a. statement and he speaks to him as he walks around the car.
sykes,Pike... .I heard about one they got up north that. kin fly; Pike nods sagely. Te.ctor Gorch on the other side of the car hears the remark.
pike,"No,. the old man's right. They -got t em now with motors and wings -- cover 60 miles in less than an hour...goin' to use them in the war, they say.  This could cover. 30 miles in an hour -- ' cording to the road, of course."
dutch,That could run a horse right into the ground.
pike,"Not that easy -- these automobiles can't stand.any rough ground -- or hot sun like a horse ---they're for show mostly. 191 TECTOR TOUCHES A FENDER AND ONE of the guards spurs toward him, cursing in Spanish. Tector backs off,. hands in the air."
tector,"I was just going to touch th.,e damn thing, not marry it."
angel,Un gigante de miquina -- Ha de tenor una fuerza tremenda. 
guard,"-La fuerza.do 1,000 caballos. "
angel,Y el dueno -- un general por lo menos. 
guard,"Mapache? Mis que un general - un hombre hecho para reinar todo Mexico, si Dios quiere. "
pike,"You're here with us,pardner -- any business you got with the general comes after we finish ours -- and that is selling horses.."
angel," As you wish. He turns away, Pike grabs him, jerks him back,"
dutch, Angel -- who does this thing belong to?
angel, Es el carrazo oficial de.su excelencia el Generalisimo Mapache. Dutch turns smiling and tells the others.
dutch,The official carrazo of the Pache Generalisimo. CONTINUED
pike,"Let's get some beer and talk to the general about his automobile and our extra horses,,.nice and easy. The men turn and follow him into the cantina."
emma,Diga?
pike,"Beers.. six cervesas,"
emma,"Como? Angel remains silent, looking at the General,"
dutch,Seii cervesas. The girl leaves to' get the order. The men at the table look around the cantina. At a nearby table a group of men are throwing dice and laughing loudly. The mariachis are gather- ing around Mapache.. Lyle shifts in his chair to look at them. 198 MAPACHE IS LAUGHING AND DRINKING. The German. leans close to Zamorra and speaks in Spanish.
mohr,Do you know these Americans?
zamorra,No. The German settles back in his.chair and. begins placing a cigarette in a holder.
tector,Probably talking about us behind our backs. 200 DUTCH TURNS TO PIKE WHO IS QUAFFING a large beer.
dutch,I'm down to about twenty in silver...
pike,The G3neralisimo has cleaned this part a of the country ...He ought to have it to spare.
dutch,Generalisimo hell -- he's just a damn bandit grabbing all he can for himself.
dutch,No sir -- we don't.hang nobody or torture them -- I hope the people here kick him and the rest of the scum like him right into-their graves.
angel,"We will if it takes a thousand years: Then suddenly, he reacts to the sound of a girl's voice off scene."
teresa,"Vamos:...te va. gustar el Alenman: Angel. spins around in his chair watching as: 202 TWO PRETTY MEXICAN GIRLS, TERESA AND RASA, laughing and giggling, pass-the table."
angel,.Teresa; He reaches out and grabs the better looking of the two by the arm.
rosa,Llamo los otros!
teresa,"No, Vete, ahorita vengo; Pike and Dutch tense as Angel stands and jerks her toward him, -"
pike,"Let her go! 203 ANGEL LOOKS AT THE GIRL, furious and hurt.."
angel,Djaste el pueblo;
teresa,Si deje el pinche pueblo. Y ahora vivo con el generalisimo; She jerks away from Angel and starts toward the other table.
pike,Take it easy! He places a hand on Angel's shoulder.
dutch, Que pasa::
pike,His sweetheart --
angel," ""She was my woman and she left the village.,"
mapache,Qua basura es este? Mapache again. kicks Angel..
zamorra,Why did he try to kill His Excellency...?
pike,"He didn't, he was. after the girl... Mapache is having difficulty understanding. He looks at Z'amorra with a puzzled expression."
zamorra,"La.muchacha,.."
dutch,Era su novia; The Mexicans immediately respond to Dutch's explanation. Both Z.amorra and Mapache smile.
pike,He went a little crazy when he saw her with you. Mapache laughs. His ego is pleased with the idea that.he had taken someone's woman. He turns and explains grandly in Spanish to the rest of. the cantina.
mohr, Are you men in Agua Verde for business?
mohr,"You must have been associated with the American Army, is that riot so? Tector and Lyle snicker slightly at the remark. Mapache and Zamorra turn, listening carefully to the conversation. The cantina is silent."
dutch,-No -- were not associated with anyone...
mohr,"I see,..1 was curious because of.the equipment which you are carrying.  That pistol is restricted for use'by army personnel. It can't be purchased or even owned... legally."
mohr,"You're surprised at my interest?  Weapons are a specialty of mine. Mohr bows his head slightly and clicks his heels barely audib3y,"
mohr,"I am Commander Frederick Mohr-of the Imperial German. Army. For the last six- months I have been in Mexico helping fight against the revolutionaries. 212. ANGEL ON THE FLOOR IS CONSCIOUS, but uimoving., listening to what is being said. Several of Mapache's men stand around him."
mohr,Unfortunately your government has chosen to aid the rabble in their so-called struggle for liberty...
pike,I. never heard of any American troops fighting down here...
mohr,They are aiding in diplomatic channels... It would be very useful to us if we knew of Americans who did not share their government's naive sentiments.
pike,"We have vez""y'few sentiments in common with our government."
mapache,Qua diga?
mohr," Generalisimo, I think we should ask these gentlemen to have a drink with us. And Pike, understanding. that much Spanish, smiles as we."
pike,Of all those garrison rail spurs that ofie is the easiest to hit -- But I've got to figure where we can get out with. the wagon.
