captain,"Auto, Eve found the plant. Fire up the Holo-detector."
autopilot,"Not necessary, Captain. You may give it to me."
captain, You know what? I should do it myself.
autopilot,Captain!
autopilot,"Sir, I insist you give me the plant."
captain,"Auto, get out of my way."
autopilot,"Sir, we cannot go home."
captain,What are you talking about? Why not?
autopilot,"That is classified. Captain, give me the plant."

captain,"That's -- that's nearly 700 years ago!! Auto, things have changed! We've got to go back!"
autopilot,"Sir, orders are: ""Do not return to Earth""."
captain,"But life is sustainable now! Look at this plant, green and growing! It's living proof he was wrong."
autopilot,"Irrelevant, Captain."
captain,"What?! It's completely relevant!  Out there is our home! Home, Auto! And it's in trouble! I can't just sit here and...and...do nothing! That's all I've done! That's all anyone on this blasted ship has ever done...NOTHING!!"
