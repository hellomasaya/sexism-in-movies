olson,"Yeah, hiyah."
osbourne,"Aren't you with...aren't you, uh..."
palmer,"Yeah, that's right. Oz, look. There's no easy way to say this. We're taking you off the Balkans desk."
osbourne,You're----what? Why?
palmer,In fact we're moving you out of Sigint entirely.
osbourne,"...What?    No discussion, just----you're out?"
palmer,"Well, we're having the discussion now Oz. This doesn't have to be unpleasant."
osbourne,"Palmer, with all due respect----what the fuck are you talking about?"
palmer,"... Look, Ozzie----"
osbourne,What the fuck is this?!     Is it my----I know it's not my work.
palmer,Ozzie----
osbourne,I'm a great fucking analyst!     Is it----
palmer,"Oz, things are not going well.      As you know."
peck,You have a drinking problem.
osbourne,I have a drinking problem.
palmer,"This doesn't have to be unpleasant. We found you something in State. It's a, uh..."
osbourne, This is an assault.
peck,"Come on, Ozzie."
osbourne,"This is an assault. I have a drinking problem? Fuck you, Peck, you're a Mormon!"
peck,Ozzie----
osbourne,Next to you we all have a drinking problem! Fuck you guys! Whose ass didn't I kiss? Let's be honest!
palmer,"Okay, Olson----"
osbourne,Let's be fucking honest...
katie,You're home.
osbourne,"Hang on to your hat, honey.    I have some news. I----"
katie,Did you pick up the cheeses?
osbourne,Huh?
katie,Were they ready? I didn't know you were coming home this early.
osbourne, The cheeses.
katie,I left a message for you to stop at Todaro's. The Magruders and the Pfarrers are coming over.
osbourne,The Pfarrers? Ugh.    I----what did Kathleen say?
katie,What?
osbourne,When you left the message?
katie,She said.    She would give you.   The message.
osbourne,"Well she, I don't know, I guess we had bigger news today. My day didn't revolve arou----"
katie,So you didn't get the cheeses.
osbourne,"Well, since I didn't get the message, no, I didn't get the cheeses. But hang on to your hat, I----"
katie,"Oh for fuck's sake, Ozzie, you mean I have to go out again? All right, well, you better get dressed."
osbourne,"Honey, we have to talk."
katie,"Not right now. They'll be here in, what, less than an hour."
voice,"Is this a, uh, goat cheese?"
harry,Because I have lactose reflux.    But I can----
osbourne,You're lactose intolerant?
harry,"Yes, but I can----"
osbourne,Or you have acid reflux?    They're two different things.
harry,I know what they are.
osbourne,Then you misspoke yourself.    So I----
harry,Thank you for correcting me.
katie,"You should try the chevre, Harry. It's very good."
harry,Yeah.   I can eat goat cheese.
katie,Harry works with the Marshalls'                       * Service.                                              *
doug magruder,"Ah. I'm on the legislative side, I                 * work with Senator Hobby.                           * "
osbourne,If you want he'll show you his great big gun.
harry,Very amusing. The gun is actually no big deal. Twenty years in the marshall's service and I've never discharged my weapon.
osbourne,Sounds like something you should be telling your psychiatrist.
harry,What?   I don't have a psychiatrist.
doug magruder,"Boy, I guess my job is pretty undramatic. I'm on the legislative side. What do you do Mrs. Pfarrer? Do you also carry a gun?"
harry,Sandy writes children's books.
sandy,I write children's books----
harry,Oliver The Cat Who...Who..arghh----Who----
tina,Those are wonderful!    My nieces and nephews----
harry,"Yeah, it's a beloved series. You wouldn't believe her fan mail. Unghh. Are you sure this is goat cheese?"
katie,"Why don't you let your wife tell them about her own books, Harry?"
harry,I'm sorry----was I----
katie,"Here, come in the kitchen, help me with the crudits."
harry,"Goddamnit.     He knows, doesn't he."
katie,Knows what?
harry,"About us, he knows about us.          Little prick."
katie,"Don't be an ass, he doesn't know a thing."
harry,"What is that, forbo?"
harry,What a horse's ass.
sandy,I don't know why we see them.
harry,"Well, she's all right."
sandy,"She is a cold, stuck-up bitch."
katie,You quit?!
osbourne,Uh-huh.
katie,Well----Thank you for letting me know!
osbourne,I tried to tell you this afternoon.
katie,"You tried? You tried? And then---- what, the aphasia kicked in?"
osbourne,Our guests came. We----
katie,"Why?!    For fuck's sake, Ozzie!"
osbourne,I'm just----I don't know.    I got so tired.
katie,You're tired.
osbourne,Tired of swimming against the current.
katie,Uh-huh.
osbourne,"Independent thought is not only not valued there, they resist it, they fight it, the bureaucracy is positively----"
katie,"Did you get a pension, or severance or something, or----"
osbourne,"I didn't retire you know, I, I quit. I don't want their benefits."
katie,"But I suppose my benefits are all right, I suppose you can live with those, is that the idea?"
osbourne,It's not like that's the only way to make money.
katie,Yes?    Yes?     What're you gonna do?
osbourne,I'll do some consulting.
katie,Consulting.
osbourne,"Yes, to help while I----I've always wanted to write."
katie,Write.    Write what.
osbourne,"I've been thinking about it.    A book, a sort of, sort of memoir.  Katie stares at him in the mirror.  A beat.  She bursts into laughter."
osbourne,"You okay there, Dad?"
terikhian,... I know this kind of man.    We've seen this.
katie,"Yes. This is my fear. He's trying---- he says----he's trying to pull himself together, but..."
terikhian,"Look, sure, I----I'm obliged to tell you you should try to salvage things. And you should. People turn themselves around. Not unheard-of. But. You---- you haven't broached the possibility of divorce yet?"
katie,No.
terikhian,"Well that's good.   Because first you should get all his financials. Before he's forewarned. Because here's a man, here's a man, practiced in deceit, this is almost, you could say it's his job, practiced at hiding things, and there is no reason, it is not improper, there is no reason for you not to get a picture of the household finances. Paper files, computer files, whatever----this is your prerogative. You can be a spy too, madam. Do this before you put him on alert. Before the turtle can draw in his head and his, uh..."
osbourne,We were young and committed and there was nothing we couldn't do. We thought of the Agency less as... less as...
machine,You have reached The Cox Group...
osbourne, Hello.
osbourne,Single...
harry,I should try to get a run in.
katie,Ozzie!
voices,Tune every heart and every voice...
men,... Bid every care withdraw.    Let all with one accord rejoice...
doctor,"Well we can do liposuction there as well, but that area will respond to exercise. Buttocks and upper arms begin to store more fat when you get up around forty, the body just tells it to go there, but the thighs will respond to toning exercises."
patient,"Uh-huh. I know, I can work out on my arms til the cows come home, but..."
doctor,Uh-huh. And of course there are also genetic factors.
patient,The Litzkes are big.
doctor,"Uh-huh, well everything's----"
patient,My mom had an ass that could pull a bus.
doctor,Wow.    Well that's a predispo----
patient,"Father's side too, although Dad tends to carry his weight in front of him."
doctor,Uh-huh.
patient,"In the gut area. Derriere, not so much."
doctor,Okay.
linda,"And what about the face, you know, the window to the soul."
doctor,Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Very well put. Well your eyes are one of your best features. But we can do something about the incipient crow's feet.
linda,Baby crow's feet. Little chickling's feet. I mean chicks. Chickie chickie chickie.
doctor,"Ha-ha, yes, again, well put. You have a way with words. We cut here..."
linda,"Yeah, I don't wanna look like Boris Karloff."
doctor,"Uh-huh! Heh-heh, so you don't want a sex change!"
linda,"No, I'm all woman!"
doctor,"So Linda, what we're talking about here is four different procedures.  The liposuction... The rhinoplasty... The facial tuck, which I would strongly recommend over the chemical peel----"
linda,"Yeah, I don't want to get anything burned off."
doctor,"And why should you. With that lovely skin. And lastly, the breast augmentation. Now we can also do something about the vaccine scar----I don't know if you wear sleeveless dresses much----"
linda,Not with these ham hocks!
doctor,"Yes, well once they're nice and svelte, post-op, you----"
linda,"Well I don't know. Is the vaccine thing----can you counsel me on this? I don't know, is it unsightly? I see it a lot, a bunch of people have it."
doctor,Absolutely! Some women don't mind it at all! Personal taste!
linda,Chad!
patron,Ow!
chad,"I'm sorry, was that too much?"
patron,I felt a straining... a tightness in the... in the front of my ass...
chad,Well you're pretty tight.     You have to feel it or----
linda, Chad Feldheimer. Office.
chad,I'll be back in a minute.     We'll work on opening those hips.
linda,I got a batch from BeWithMeDC dot com.
chad,Oh wow.   Any good?
linda,"I don't know yet, just looking... How do you open this?"
chad,"Click on, uh... yeah..."
linda,Oh my god!
chad,What?
linda,"Oh my God, what a loser!"
chad,Cripes.
linda,Loser!
chad,Did you have to send a picture?
linda,"No, only guys do. I submitted a verbal profile, turn-ons, turn-offs, et cetera. I'm really looking for someone with a sense of humor."
chad,That guy----wait----that guy wasn't bad.
linda,Him?
chad,"No, before."
linda,Him?
chad,"Yeah.    He uh, he might not be a loser."
linda,How can you tell?
chad,That's a Brioni suit.
linda,Oh yeah?
chad,Shit yeah.
linda, Does he look like he has a sense of humor?
chad,He looks like his optometrist has a sense of humor.
linda,State Department.
chad,That's cool.
linda,His hair is... what is that?
chad,Plugs.
linda,"This is the cardio area. A lot of machines here so that, believe me, there's never a wait. What you're seeing now, this is our busiest time, and there's still a couple of open treadmills I see, three Stairmasters---- I call it the Butt-Blaster----couple of LifeCycles----Hi, Chad."
chad,Hi Linda.     Did you call that guy?
linda,"Not yet! Chad is one of our trainers. I've just started internet dating and I got my first look at the, uh..."
customer,What service?
linda,BeWithMeDC dot com?
customer,Nice.
linda,Have you used them?
customer,No----two friends did and they're both hooked up. With really special guys.
linda,That's fantastic.
linda,Yes!
linda driving,... Agent!     Agent!
linda,"... Yes, hi, this is Linda Litzke, should I give you my account number? You have it up? Okay. I was informed that I needed pre-approval for these surgeries, and then... Yes, it was denied."
linda,Alan?
linda,Oh for Pete's sake!
harry,"... and then, you know, you grow up. I guess that's what's happened with me. You just... people change. We married when I was, what, in my mid- twenties. A kid. We were kids. Twenties. You think it's forever. Then, you know, you're older----you begin to feel your mortality, you start to think, well, there's no more time for dishonesty. Subterfuge. You go, I'm not that person. The choices you made, you can't, just through inertia----"
katie,I'm thinking of divorcing Ozzie.
harry,"... I'm just thinking, Whoa. I mean, frankly, I'm thinking, Whoa. I, I, I guess that's what I should be thinking about too. With Sandy."
katie,That's what you were just saying.
harry,Yes! Absolutely! And you should be getting rid of that bozo.  No question about that. I agree.
katie,So if I were divorced----
harry,"Well yes, if you were uh, you know, yes. Yes, I should settle things. With Sandy. Because of you and me. It just takes, courage, you know. To inflict that pain. Scary stuff. "
katie,Why's that? I don't see that.
harry," But Sandy, she's... a good lady. A very special lady."
katie,"She's a cold, stuck-up bitch."
harry,Well that's... a little----
katie,You and I should sort things out. I've told you that this is not just frivolity.
harry,"No, that's understood.   You've been very straight."
katie,I thought I was loud and clear.
harry,Absolutely. Not just fun and games.
linda,English!... Agent!... Agent!...
recorded voice,----important to us. Please stay on the line for the next available agent.
chad,Holy shit...
linda,"Ted, can I talk to you about our Mickey Mouse health plan?"
ted,Uh-huh... Hang on...
chad,This is some heavy shit.
linda,Is that my date list?
chad,No... fuck...
linda,"You know, I'm trying to reinvent myself, and these procedures, which are so incredibly not cheap, this Micky Mouse HMO is saying they're not, they're... What is this?"
chad,I can't believe this... This is like... intelligence shit.
ted,I am not comfortable with this.
linda,What is it?
chad,"This is, like, I can't believe this shit I'm seeing."
ted,Manolo found it.
chad,"Manolo found this, like, CD just lying in a locker. Locker floor. Ladies' locker room."
manolo,Jus lie-een there.
chad,"And I'm like, whoa, someone's music or what, so I come in here and it's these files, man."
ted,I am not comfortable with this.                       *
chad,"Like it's talking about SigInt, and signals and shit. Which, Signals means code, you know."
manolo,It was jus lie-een there.
chad,"Talking about like, section heads here, and their names and shit. And then these other files are just, like, numbers. Arrayed. Numbers and dates and numbers... And numbers. I think                  * that's the shit, man. The raw intelligence."
ted,I am not touching this.    I want this out of here.
chad,Wul... Throw it out?
linda,You can't do that! You should put a note up in the ladies' locker room.
chad,"Put a note up? Highly classified shit found, Signals intelligence shit, CIA shit? Hello! Did you lose your secret CIA shit? I don't think so."
ted,"Look, you figure it out, I am not comfortable with this. I want this                   * out of Hardbodies..."
chad,"Look,   Manolo..."
manolo,I found it on the floor there.
chad,"Yeah, I know, but"
manolo,Right there on the floor there.      Lie- een there.
sandy,Harry?      Is that you?
harry,"Yeah, yeah, it's me."
linda,"Absolut Saketini, please?"
ted,Just a Tab.
linda,"You know, it wouldn't cover all of it, but if I got some advance on my salary I could at least get the surgery ball rolling."
ted,"Whoa! There's a payroll company, you know. They don't just advance people money. They just don't do that. I mean, sure, I could say, Yes, I                           * authorize it, but that's not going to mean anything to them."
linda,"Well why do they have us on a cockamamie health plan? I need these surgeries, Ted!"
ted,You're a beautiful woman!   You don't need
linda,"Ted, I have gone just as far as I can go with this body! I----"
ted,I think it's a very beautiful----it's not a phoney-baloney Hollywood body----
linda,"That's right, Ted, I would be laughed out of Hollywood. I have very limited breasts and a gi-normous ass and I have this gut that swings back and forth in front a me like a shopping cart with a bent wheel."
ted,Oh come on!
linda,"I am trying to get back in circulation. I have appetites and so forth, and, uh----"
ted,Well there's a lot of guys who'd like you just the way you are.
linda,Yeah----losers!
ted,"Well, I don't know. Am I a loser? Lemme tell you something. I wasn't always a manager at Hardbodies. I, um... *"
linda,Omygod----is that you?!
ted,"Fourteen years, a Greek Orthodox priest. Congregation in Chevy Chase."
linda,"Well jeez, that's a good job!"
ted,Mm-hm.
linda,What happened?
ted,Well...
linda,Well that's my point! I don't want to stay where I am! I want to find someone to share my journey!
ted,"Well, sometimes, you know, you don't look in your own back yard, you're never gonna see----"
linda,That's right! That's why I've started this internet dating!
ted,"Uh-huh, but I'm saying, maybe you don't have to, you know... to----"
linda,"Look Ted, I know you can't authorize an advance on my salary but you can put in a request, can't you?"
ted,"It's not going to do any good, Linda."
linda,"Ted, have you ever heard of the power of positive thinking?"
linda,Hurrow----
chad,Omygod.
chad,Omygod.
linda,"Chad, you know what time it is?"
chad,"Uh-huh. So, like, I couldn't tell you this on your totally unsecure phone, but I know who the guy is."
linda,The guy?
chad,"The guy, the secret guy."
linda,Is he high up?
chad,"Um. I don't know if he's high up. Probably. I mean, I know his name, not like his rank."
linda,What is it?
chad,Osbourne.    Cox.
linda,Never heard of him.
chad,"Oh, like you're so plugged in to the intelligence community."
linda,"I'm just saying, to the layman----"
chad,Well I think like the quality of the intelligence dictates how high up he is.
linda,Uh-huh.
chad,Not what we know.
linda,Uh-huh.
chad,And I also got his----do you have any water? I gotta hydrate.
linda,I have tap water
chad,Are you kidding?
linda,How did you find out who he is?
chad,Sources.
linda,What do you mean sources?
chad,"Do you have like Gatorade? Anything besides, like, Maryland swamp water?"
linda,How do you know his name?
chad,"I have this geek friend, Ernie Gallegos? He does computer stuff, hooks up people's computers and programs their VCRs'n shit? So he examines the files and he pulls off the digital watermark that tells what computer they were created on. Fucking child's play for Ernie."
linda,Uh-huh.
chad,I also have his telephone number. That was a little harder.
linda,Omygod!
chad,Shall we give him a tinkle?
linda,"Omygod, why?"
chad,"Because he's gonna wanna know that his shit is secure. You know, he's gonna be relieved. He might even be so relieved he gives us a reward----I would be very fucking surprised if he did not."
linda,"Oh, wow."
chad,"Very surprised. Like, you know, the                            * Good Samaritan tax. Which is not even a tax, really, since it's voluntary."
chad,Hello?
osbourne,Hello?
chad,Osbourne?    Osbourne Cox?
osbourne,Yes----uh----Who is this?
chad,Are you... uh... Osbourne Cox?
osbourne,Who is this? What time is it?     Who are you?
chad,"I'm a Good Samaritan. I'm sorry I'm calling at such an hour, but I thought you might be worried."
osbourne,Worried?
chad,About the security.     Of your shit.
osbourne,What on earth are you talking about? Who am I speaking to?
katie,Who is it?
chad,Your files----your documents. I know these documents are sensitive. But I am perfectly happy to return to you your sensitive shit. At a time of your choosing.
osbourne,What documents? What are you talking about?
chad,... Osbourne Cox?
osbourne," Yes! Yes, I'm Osbourne Cox!     Who the fuck"
chad,"Settle down, Osbourne."
katie,Who is that?
osbourne,What documents are you talking about?
chad," OK. ""The bureau chief in Belgrade we                 * all called Slovak the Butcher. He had very little report with his staff, and his despatches were marked by----"
osbourne,"Ra-por, very little rapport with his staff, you fucking moron!    How did you get----"
chad,"Don't blow a gasket, Osbourne.    I have----"
osbourne,How did you get a hold of that!
chad,It's not important where I----
osbourne,You're in way over your fucking head! Who the fuck are you? You have no idea what you're doing!
chad,"Oh! Why so uptight, Osbourne Cox? I'm just a Good Samaritan, like, a traveler on the road who has happened upon----"
linda,"We're going to return it, we just thought----"
chad,"Linda, I'll do it!"
osbourne,Who's this?!
katie,"Ozzie, what is going on."
linda,Like a Good Samaritan tax----
osbourne,Who the fuck----
chad,"You know, this is a major inconvenience for us and we thought, you know, a reward----"
osbourne,So it's money! So it's money!
chad,"Well, yeah, uh... why not? I mean, this is not----am I out of line here?"
osbourne,"All right, you two clowns listen to me very very carefully. I don't know who you are, but I warn you most emphatically----"
linda,"You warn us? You warn us? You know what, Mr., Mr. Intelligence? We warn you! We'll call you back with our demands!"
chad,Hello?   We just----
osbourne,"Who, who----"
linda,Chad!    Don't play his game!
osbourne,Hello!   Hello!
chad, Sorry.
linda,The nerve of that guy!
chad,... I am very fucking surprised he did not give us the reward.
katie,What in God's name is going on?
osbourne,There's some clown----a couple of clowns ----somehow got a hold of my memoir----
katie,Your what?
osbourne,Stole it or----I have no idea how they got it----
katie,Your what?
osbourne,"My memoir, the book   I'm writing."
katie,Why in God's name would they think that's worth anything.
osbourne,Well they----I... I've no idea how they got it.
chad,But it doesn't sound like he's gonna play ball.
linda,"Oh, he'll play ball! We just have to let him know who's boss."
chad,"Well, that's----he sounds very senior. I think this is some senior guy who has screwed the pooch, big-time."
linda,"Yeah, that's why we got him, you know, we've caught him with his thing caught in a big fat wringer."
chad,Yuh-huh.
linda,"And us in the driver's seat. This is our opportunity, like, you don't get many of these. You slip on the ice outside of, you know, a fancy restaurant."
chad,Yuh-huh.
linda,Or this happens.
chad,Right.
linda,And right now this has happened.
chad,Yup.   It sure has.
linda,This could put a big dent in my surgeries.
chad,Big time.

katie,Yes.   Understood.
linda,Harry?    I'm Linda.
harry,"Yeah, I did the whole bodyguard thing for years. My guy was in State, the Secretary in fact, so of course I traveled a lot."

ted,That's great. That sounds... exciting.
linda,He's very very communicative. Very accessible. He has a sense of humor. And he agrees one hundred percent about my surgeries.
ted,"Well, I----"
linda,"He thinks my ass could be smaller. I mean, not in a mean way, he kidded about it----he's got a terrific sense of humor."
ted,"That's good, but... but... Linda, what do you really know about this guy?"
linda,"I told you, he's in the Treasury Department and he----"
ted,"But he could be one of these people who, you know, who cruises the internet----"

chad,Well----you mean----go home and change?
linda,Yeah!
chad,I was gonna ride my bike.     Do I have time?
katie,----which to my mind is all the more reason to lower the boom on Ozzie.
harry,Mm.
katie,"That's it?     ""Mm""?"
harry,I'm just... wondering if it's the right time.
katie,Of course it's the right time.   Why wouldn't it be the right time.   Does it threaten you?
harry,"No no. No, you and me are rock solid. That's why I, uh, I think we can afford to be big. We can think about Ozzie, whether maybe we should let him get himself together a little before you hammer him with, um----"
katie,"Is that how you see me, ""hammering"" him?"
harry,"Of course not, but----"
katie,Weren't those your words?
harry,"Yes, but----"
katie,"I don't ""hammer."""
harry,"No, uh-huh, of course not. But, I'm saying----I'm no friend of the guy. You know that. I think he's an arrogant little geek. But for Christ sakes, you and me have all the time in the world, and he just lost his job----"
katie,"He didn't lose it, he quit."
harry,"Yeah. Most of the people who ""quit"" in this town were fired."
katie,Maybe. As long as we're talking about Ozzie and not you.
harry,"Of course we're talking about Ozzie. Baby, I stand by you whatever you do. I adore you."
katie,Please get the check.
harry,I love you so much.
chad,Osbourne Cox?
osbourne,"And you, I take it, are ""Mr. Black""?"
chad,Yes I am.    You have the money?
osbourne,The fifty-thousand dollars.
chad,"That's what was agreed upon, Osbourne Cox."
osbourne,"All right. Let me explain something to you, ""Mr. Black."" You know who I am; I know who you are."
chad, Perhaps. But appearances can be---- deceptive.
osbourne,"Yeah. What you're engaged in is blackmail, which is a felony. That's for starters."
chad,Appearances can be----deceptive.   I am a mere Good Samar----
osbourne,"Secondly, the unauthorized dissemination of classified material is a federal crime. If you ever carried out your proposed threat, you would experience such a shitstorm of consequences, my friend, it would make your empty little head spin faster than your Schwinn bicycle over there."
chad,You think that's a Schwinn?
osbourne,"Now give me the fucking floppy or the CD or whatever the fuck you have it on, and I will----"
chad,"As soon as you give me the money, dickwad! I'm not----Huhgf!"
osbourne,"Give it to me, fuck!"
chad,You fuck!     You fucker!
osbourne,"I know who you are, fucker!"
chad,You're the fucker!
linda,Where's the money?
chad,He hit me!
linda,Where's the money?!
chad,He didn't give it to me
linda,"Oh, for----Get in!"
chad,That fucker!
chad,... Hey----what're you----
osbourne,Holy fucking----you fucking morons!
linda,That'll give him something to think about.
chad,"Wait, wait! We gotta go back!"
linda,I knew this would happen.
chad,We gotta go back!     My bike!
linda,It's on to Plan B.
chad,It's just a Kryptonite lock----you can open those fuckers with a Bic pen!
linda,Heavens sakes----
chad,Where we going?     My bike!
linda,Some people!
chad,... What is this?
linda,Russian Embassy.
linda,I told Mr. Krapkin I might be stopping                      * by?
chad,Is there a men's room?
krapotkin,----Not exactly. I am assistant cultural attach. The organs of state security are not allowed to function within the borders of your country.
linda,... The organs of state security?
krapotkin,Yes.
linda,"But if I had, oh, say, secrets of a highly, um, secrets that would interest the organs of state security..."
krapotkin,Yes.
linda,... This is just a taste.
krapotkin,May I ask the source of this...
linda,No you may not.
chad,Very high up.
linda,Chad!
chad,I'm just saying he's high up!
krapotkin,PC or Meck?
linda,Um.    PC.                                              *
krapotkin,Could you wait please?
linda,Well----

linda,Well----okay...
chad,"Name, rank and serial number."
chad,"We, um... we know our rights."
linda,This is just a taste.
linda,There's a lot more.    But we need to be paid.
chad,I don't think so.
linda,"Look, I have a date."
linda,Date.
linda,We work at the Hardbodies in Alexandria.
chad,I'm at 1442 Westerly----
linda,"Chad, not your home address!"
linda,No.    Linda.                                             *
ted treffon," Point-of-view from a car pulling into Hardbodies. Ted Treffon, the soulful manager, stands on the sidewalk in front of the gym, squinting into the approaching car, his arms out to either side, palms up: what the hell is going on?"
ted,"A line to check in, towels piling up."
linda,I'm sorry.
ted,Manolo running around like crazy----what happened to your nose?
chad,I just----
ted,This is not acceptable at Hardbodies. You two know better than that.
linda,"Yes we do.     I'm sorry, Ted."
ted,This is no way.
chad,It was unavoidable.    This won't happen again.
ted,But you won't tell me what's going on.
linda,"We can't. I... I... Ted, I know this is terrible, but----I have to run. I have a date."
ted,"You're changing, Linda."

harry,"No no, doesn't start for five minutes."
linda,"Oh!   No, no I haven't."
harry,I hear it's terrific.
dermot,"First you tell me that you can't commit, then you----WOULD YOU GET DOWN FROM THERE!  Along with Linda, Harry laughs raucously, tossing popcorn into his mouth."
harry,"Pardon our dust, I, uh----the ex is in the process of moving out. Damn! I told her I wanted to expedite this."
linda,Uh-huh.
harry,"We, uh, you know you try to act like an adult."
linda,"Oh, it's never easy."
harry,Oh! Come on downstairs.    Do you like surprises?
linda,"Well, I'm very open to new experiences..."
harry,"I gotta tell ya----I saw an ad for this in a gentleman's magazine----twelve hundred bucks. I take a look at this thing, I think, Jesus, you gotta be kidding----I'm a hobbyist, this is basically nothing but speed-rail, I could probably go to Home Depot and whip this up myself for, like, a hundred bucks..."
linda,... What is it?
harry," What is it. You siddown, feet in the stirrups, and..."
linda,Omygod!
harry,"Isn't that somethin'? Hundred bucks all-in if you don't count my labor. And the, you know----cost of the dildo. Those things are not cheap."

linda,Hey!
chad,What.
linda,I don't like the snideness!    Nor the                * negativity!
chad, I'm sorry.
linda,I'm just trying to work this thing! If I'm going to reinvent myself I need those surgeries. And those surgeries cost money! This is not just fun and games!
chad,Yuh-huh.   I'm sorry.
linda,So let's figure this thing out!
public address,"Chad, your Berry Blast is ready."
linda,We know who he is
chad,Right: Osbourne Cox.
linda,"So we can find out where he lives, right?"
chad,Um.    I guess.
linda,You should change.   Into your suit.
chad,Why?
linda,So you don't look out of place in the neighborhood. There are certain elementary things.
chad,His neighborhood?
linda,Yes. We'll remove the laundry marks and labels. And you should not be carrying ID.
chad,Laundry marks?                                               *

katie,I'm surprised you have any energy left.
harry,You kiddin'----pull around the corner we'll do it again in back!

palmer,"Not quite certain, sir, but it's... messy."
gardner chubb,Kolyma-2?
palmer,Our man in the Russian Embassy.
gardner chubb,Mm.
palmer,It was brought to them by a woman who----
gardner chubb,The Russians?
palmer,"Yeah. It was brought in by Linda Litzke, an associate of a guy named Harry Pfarrer. Picture's in the folder. With Pfarrer's."
gardner chubb,The Russians.
palmer,Yeah.
gardner chubb,Who's Pfarrer?
palmer,"Treasury agent who's been, um, screwing Mrs. Cox. Must be how they got the files. Or maybe Ozzie knows about it, they all seem to be sleeping with each other."
gardner chubb,All right.     Spare me.
palmer,Yes sir. But this Treasury guy----it's gotten... complicated. He just shot somebody in Ozzie's house.
gardner chubb,Shot----your analyst?
palmer,"Ozzie wasn't there. Our man surveying hears a gunshot, sees the Treasury guy wrestle something into his car, follows him; he dumps a body in the Chesapeake Bay."
gardner chubb,Well----what'd he do that for?
palmer,Don't know sir.
gardner chubb,Oh for Christ sake. Anyone fish the body out?
palmer,Mm-hm.
gardner chubb,Russian?   American?
palmer,Don't know. Scrubbed of ID.
gardner chubb,And this... Linda...?
palmer,Linda Litzke.
gardner chubb,She's Treasury?

ted,Linda----
linda,Just give me twenty-four hours to solve this thing!
ted,Linda. I have to tell you. A man was here earlier asking about you.
linda,Foreigner?
ted,"Linda, are you in some kind of trouble? Is Chad running from something?"
linda,"Ted, we know what we're doing. Let me ask you this: did he know my name."

krapotkin,Yes?

linda,Do you have him?
krapotkin,Do we have him?

krapotkin,Um...

krapotkin,Is he not... at Hardbodies?
linda,"No, I----look, can I come in and discuss this?"
katie,You seem distracted.
harry, Do I?
katie,Very distracted.      The last two days.
harry,Nn.   Work.
katie,"... That's enough carrots, don't you think?"
harry,Huh?
katie,For the salad?
harry,You know: you're really a very negative person.
katie,... What?
harry,I've tried. To ignore it.    And stay upbeat.
katie,Harry: stop the foolishness.
harry,Stop the foolishness?
katie,Yes. And behave.    You are not talking to one of your...
sandy,Hello?
harry,Honey.    It's so good to hear your voice.

man,Can I use your phone?   To call a tow?
sandy's voice,Hello?
osbourne,Sandy?
sandy,Yes?
osbourne,"Hi, it's Osbourne Cox, how are you. Hi."
sandy,... Hi.
osbourne,"Hi. Sorry to call out of the blue but I have a, well, a publishing question and I thought you might be the person to ask, I have this manuscript, something to do with my professional experiences, not to go into too much detail but I think it's pretty explosive stuff and I think that it could merit a fairly wide readership handled properly and it isn't quite finished yet but there's a situation where I'm worried about it leaking now and maybe excerpts being published or on the internet, whatever, without my permission, and a lot of the impact being, um, blunted, so I'm actually anxious to bring it to market sooner than I'd planned----I mean, like now, in fact----so I was thinking, I know you, and you seem to do well, so I was wondering if you were happy with your publisher. The people you use."
sandy,You've written a children's book?
osbourne,"No! No no, a, a kind of a memoir, but ----doesn't your company have an adult arm? Or isn't it, uh, the children's arm? Of a regular publisher?"
sandy,Pappas & Swain do children's literature.
osbourne,Uh-huh. I see. So they don't---- okay... Are you well?
sandy,Very well thank you.    And you.
osbourne,"Yes. Good. Okay, well, thank you Sandy."
sandy,Yes.    Good talking to you.
osbourne,Bitch.
krapotkin,"Yes, madam. Can we help you?"
linda,"What kind of Mickey Mouse embassy are you running?! I've been waiting here for fifty-five minutes, and I'm----"
krapotkin,"I am so sorry, madam.   An urgent matter."
linda,"Well this could be urgent too, since, you know, Chad has been missing for forty-eight hours now and----"
krapotkin,"I don't know the whereabouts of Chad, madam."
linda,Well he was gathering information for you when he----
krapotkin,"We're not interested in such ""information"". It was drivel."
linda,... Dribble!
krapotkin,Would you like your disk back?
linda,... Dribble!
krapotkin,I'm so sorry I can't help you.
linda,"I'll tell you what's dribble! You listen to me, Mr. Krapkin! I am----"
linda,Cut it out.
osbourne,... What?
ted,"No-o-o-o-o-o way.   No way.   Whoa.   No way, Linda..."
linda,"But Ted, I can't do it, I don't know anything about computers."
ted,"Linda, the whole thing is crazy. It was crazy the first time, and you want to do it again? Break into the man's house? And why would----why would----you said the Russians didn't even want this stuff!"
linda,"My world is bigger than that, Ted. There's other people. There's the Chinese."
ted,"Linda, these surgeries----"
linda,"It's not just the surgeries, Ted! It's not just the money! We can use it as leverage! To get Chad back!"
ted,"What do you mean ""get him back""!"
linda,"Information is power, Ted!     Hel-lo!"
ted,"What do you mean ""get him back""!      You don't know where he is!"
linda,Somebody has him.    And we can----
ted,You ask the police to help you find missing people! And you----
linda,"I can't take it! I can't take it! I can't take it! You know I can't do that! We're operating off the map here, Ted! This is way higher than the police, it's higher than that!"
ted,"Linda, I----"
linda,"I need a can-do person, Ted! I hate your negativity! I hate all your reasons why not! I hate you! I hate you!"
bartender's voice,What'll it be.
ted,Seven & Seven.
linda,Hurrow----
filtered voice,It's Harry.
harry,You think a marriage is... and then you...
linda,But this was a long time coming.
harry,Was it?
linda,"You're depressed, Harry."
harry, I am depressed. I gotta exercise. I haven't run in three days... butt- crunches... anything... Do you think I could stay here for a little while?
linda,"It can't always come from me, Harry! I'm not that strong!"
harry,"What's wrong, baby?     Harry's here."
linda,You're not here for me! I need a can- do person! You're all... defeated!
harry,"I'm sorry, baby----"
linda,"Chad is the only can-do person I know and he's gone, Harry, he's gone."
harry,I'll be good. I'll be better.     I just need to exercise. Are there pedestrian paths around here?
linda,"Could you help me find him?  He's a friend from work. You know law enforcement people, right? You could call, unofficially?"
harry,"Wait a minute, what's his name?   What happened?"
linda,Chad Feldheimer. He just disappeared. He hasn't been at work or at home for two days.
harry,Okay.
linda,He----
harry,You know his social security number?
linda,Huh?     NO!    I----
harry,It's okay. That's okay.     What's the last place you saw him?
linda, I don't know! He just disappeared! The last place I saw him was the Jamba Juice on K Street. And he's gone.
harry,Okay baby. We'll find your friend. Missing person. Piece of cake.
woman's voice,"No, stay open..."
osbourne,Yeah? The same patient she's been with since YESTERDAY? BullSHIT!
filtered voice,Dr. Cox has suggested you call her attorney----
osbourne,"Yeah, RIGHT! Tell her I got the new fucking keys!"
osbourne,New keys...
sandy, And it was just then----at that very moment----that Oliver sneezed----
del,Can    we just----I'm sorry to interrupt but    we have to let the folks at home see    this illustration! Can we just get    a shot of that...
connie,That's wonderful!
del,"Wonderful! The book is ""Point of Order, Oliver!"" and the talented author is Sandra Pfarrer. We're gonna go to a station break and then be right back with Bud Fraighling, the Sultan of Salad, and Part Two of our special interview with Dermot Mulroney. So keep it where it is!"
sandy,Thank you.
del,"Yeah, you know we thought it might be fun if you joined us with Bud Fraighling and help make the Fiesta Salad, when we move over."
connie,Over on the kitchen set.
sandy,That wasn't discussed.
del,"Oh, sure! No! Only if you want to! Your segment went great, we just thought----"
sandy,"I'm sorry, I made plans."
del,"Okay, great!"
connie,"Great to see you again, Sandra!"
osbourne,New... fucking... keys... How's this for access...
pr woman,That was way out of line. We were so unbelievably clear with them: just an Oliver segment.
sandy,It's fine.
pr woman,Del and Connie are such putzes.
sandy,It's fine.     Thank you.   We're finished.
pr woman,"Huh?   Well, okay. Great, uh----"
sandy,Thought that would never be over.
man,Mmm.    Me too.
sandy,Let me scrub this crap off my face.
osbourne,Just for starters...
harry,Hello there sunshine.    You look great.
linda,Well you seem better.
harry,"Yeah, I snuck in a little gym time this morning. And our exercise last night didn't hurt!"
linda,Harry!
harry,"Boy, I am through banging my head against the wall. I am gonna start doing what's right for me."
linda,"That's how I believe, also.   You have to do what's right for----"
harry,"Yeah! Hell yeah! I mean I had a shock recently, and I realized you know, life is not infinite. No one's immortal."
linda,No one's immortal.
harry,"You have to get from each day its full, uh, squeeze the juice from every day because there but for the grace of God----"
linda,Exactly. The important thing is to maintain a positive outlook. Always up. Always ebullient.
harry,"That's right, don't sweat the small stuff..."
linda,Of course I do.
harry,"You never know what the important days are, until... until, um..."
linda," No, no."
harry,"Nothing yet, I've made a couple calls. I don't think it'll take long."
linda,Really?
harry,"Oh yeah, there are so many data bases now it's a joke..."
linda,Uh-huh.
harry,Did he----when you left the Jamba Juice ----did Chad say anything about where he might be going?
linda,"Oh, I know where he was going."
harry,Oh yeah?
linda,A residence in Alexandria.    On Hillsboro Drive.
harry,Who are you?
linda,I'm ... just ... Linda Litzke.
osbourne,Ow!   Fuck!
linda,Oh for Pete's sake.
osbourne,And you are... my wife's lover.
ted,No.
osbourne,Then what are you doing here.
ted,I'm not here representing Hardbodies.
osbourne,I know what you represent. You represent the idiocy of today.
ted,"I don't represent that, either."
osbourne,Oh yes. You're the guy when I went to ask about that moronic woman.
ted,She's not----
osbourne,You're in league with that moronic woman. You're part of a league of morons.
ted,No.
osbourne,Yes. You're one of the morons I've been fighting all my life. My whole fucking life. But guess what. Guess what. Today I win.
