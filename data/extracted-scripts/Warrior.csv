Speaker,Dialogue
paddy,Tommy?
tommy,I was just passing through. Figured why not have a belt with the old man.
paddy," Yeah, she's hanging in there."
tommy,"Well, you always did take good care of her. Paddy Conlon. Man of priorities."
paddy,"She did. But that's not for me anymore, Tommy."
tommy,What? You change brands?
paddy,"C'mon, let's go inside."
tommy,I like what you've done with the place.
tommy,There's not much of a woman's touch around here.
tommy,Yeah? Must be hard to find a girl who can take a punch nowadays.
paddy,Here you go.
tommy,Coffee? You haven't seen a guy in 14 years and you're not gonna have a drink with him?
paddy,"I told you, I'm off it. I'm coming up on a thousand days."
tommy,"C'mon, just one drink."
paddy,No.
tommy,"So you found God, huh? That's awesome. Mom kept calling for him, but he wasn't around. I guess Jesus was down at the mill forgiving all the drunks. Who knew?"
paddy,I know.
tommy,"Oh, you know? What do you know? Do you know it wasn't enough just to drive west to get away from you? When we hit the water we drove north, too."
paddy,When I got sober I hired a man to find you.
tommy, Is that one of the 12 steps? Or does a guy like you get 24?
tommy,Did your guy tell you what you needed to know?
paddy,Just that your mother died in Tacoma. And you were in the Marines. That was all. That was enough.
tommy,That's too bad. You could've gotten some good details.
paddy,"I'm sorry, Tommy."
tommy,"It's good to know you're sorry, Pop. Goes a long way."
tess,What's going on here?
brendan,"Well, I'm not sure, but I think Daddy is now a princess."
tess,"Em, you want to open your presents?"
brendan,It's her birthday.
tess," I know, but that's why you call it a budget. You set it, and you don't budge."
tess,"Hey babe, I'm late. Mom's saying goodbye to the girls. She's gotta get on the road. They've been fed. They just need a bath."
brendan,I'm on it.
tess,Can you get them down at a reasonable time tonight? They're exhausted.
brendan,Where's the rest of that skirt?
tess,Babe.
brendan,"Listen, if any guys give you a hassle in that joint tonight you give me a call, okay?"
tess, Yeah. Just like you gave me a call when those Temple frat boys decided to smash up your face.
brendan,"I told you, most nights I sit on the stool and grade papers, but every now and then I need some action."
tess,"Alright, well wait up for me tonight. I'll see what I can do about that."
brendan,"Promises, promises."
tommy,Fitzy still own this?
fenroy,Don't know no Fitzy. Colt Boyd owns this gym.
tommy,How's it work here?
fenroy,"Thirty five a month with locker. We're open at 7, lights out at 11. You wanna join?"
tommy,Sure.
fenroy,Put your name and contact info on the card.
brendan,"Whoa whoa whoa! There's a lesson in this too, OK? Listen up. So we have a body at rest, and you have the bat which needs--"
tito,Acceleration.
brendan,"Acceleration, right. If you have enough acceleration, you have might have a chance to break the body at rest. OK. Go ahead."
nash,Force equals mass times acceleration. We got it.
brendan,Alright. The third law--
stephon,How many laws this dude got?
brendan," The dude? The dude has three. Newton the dude says that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction."
kc,"Mr. C, I put it away."
brendan,"Alright, before you go, I have your tests from last week."
mad dog,Where do you find these girls?
colt boyd,"We got a tournament coming up. You gonna kill every guy in the `Burgh?  Fenroy. Get me some ice. And call that Puerto Rican kid, the one that fights outa the Bottoms. If he's here in 20 minutes, he gets 200 bucks."
tommy,"Yo, I'll fight him."
colt boyd,"Do me a favor guy, go back to your bag. We don't need anybody else getting hurt. G'head. Take a walk."
mad dog,"Yo Rock, what happened? You leave Mick and Paulie at home today?"
fenroy, His phone's disconnected.
colt boyd,Then go through the list. Get me Joe Bones.
tommy," All I'm saying is if you need somebody to help you, I'm happy to keep your boy warm for you."
colt boyd,You ever fought before?
tommy,Yeah.
colt boyd, This guy sign a waiver?
fenroy,All good.
colt boyd,What's your name?
tommy,Tommy.
colt boyd,"You get tuned up in here, it's on you, Tommy."
tommy,"Sure, no problem."
colt boyd,Come on in.
mad dog,Gonna be a hero? Alright.
tommy,You owe me two hundred bucks.
dan taylor,"This is the new appraisal figure, and this is how it effects the monthly. As you can see, that puts you upside down on your mortgage. That's the problem. It's the country that did the assessment, not the bank. So, the numbers are what they are, Mr. Conlon."
brendan,Brendan.
dan taylor,"The numbers are what they are, Brendan. I mean, you're a Math teacher, you can appreciate that."
brendan,I teach Physics.
dan taylor,"Physics. OK. But the bank has got to go by the new appraisal figures. According to these figures, you're upside down on your mortgage--"
brendan,"You said that three times already. I get that. But I'm asking you if there's something else you can do. Not the bank, you. Can you shift things around, restructure--"
dan taylor,"Well, you've already refinanced twice."
brendan,Because you advised us to do that.
dan taylor,I presented you with that option. It was your choice.  I'm also showing you netted a substantial payout with the refi.
brendan,We had that conversation. I was paying medical bills. Is that in your file?
dan taylor,"Oh, right. Sorry. Your daughter's...kidney?"
brendan,Heart.
dan taylor,"Heart, right.  Lot of stories."
brendan,So my option is I've got no options? You're not even gonna try to help me?
dan taylor,"I am trying, Brendan. Look, I can get you 90 days to get even--"
brendan,"90 days is not enough. My wife and I have three jobs between us and that doesn't cut it. So, what do you suggest?"
dan taylor,Let me ask you a question: have you considered bankruptcy? It's a viable option. There's no shame in it these days.
brendan,That's not how I do things.
dan taylor,"Well, then you're looking at foreclosure."
colt boyd,"How you doin,' sir? I'm looking for Tommy Riordan."
paddy,Who?
colt boyd,Tommy Riordan? My name's Colt Boyd.
paddy,What business you got with Tommy?
colt boyd,None yet. That's why I'm here. I manage fighters.
paddy,"Conlon. Name's Conlon. And anything you want to know about Tommy, you gotta ask him yourself."
colt boyd,I'm just looking for some general information here.
paddy,"Like I said, anything you want to know about Tommy, you gotta ask him yourself."
colt boyd,"Look, I don't mean to interrupt your night. He put this address down when he signed up at the gym."
paddy,He doesn't live here.
announcer,"It's time for our next contest! Introducing first, fighting out of the red corner, from Ripley, West Virginia, please welcome Mike ""The Mutilator"" Moore!"
referee,"Fighters to the center! I want you to obey my commands at all times. If you have no questions, touch gloves, back up, and wait for my signal. Come out fighting!"
promoter,Nice fight. Two more wins and you take home the bacon.
tess, Hey babe. How was work?
brendan,I'm not bouncing at a club.
tess,What do you mean you're not bouncing?
brendan,I went in to apply. They were only paying nine bucks an hour. Then I saw a sign for this other thing.
tess, I thought we agreed that we weren't going to raise our children in a family where their father gets beat up for a living.
brendan,We're not giving up the house. This is our home. We're not going BACKWARDS
tess,We'll figure it out. But this is what we're not going back to.
paddy,You wanted to talk?
tommy,Yeah.  I'm gonna start fighting.
paddy,That right?
tommy,Don't play babe in the woods with me. I know that guy from the gym came to see you.
paddy,"Colt Boyd? I didn't tell him anything, Tommy."
tommy,We wouldn't be sitting here now if you did.
paddy,What about Colt Boyd?
tommy,What about him? I told him I don't train with people I don't know.
paddy,"Ah, the devil you know."
tommy,Excuse me?
paddy,The devil you know is better than the devil you don't.
tommy," I just told you, this doesn't mean anything. You get that through your skull right now or I'm walking."
paddy,"Alright. Alright. But you get something through your skull, too. You called me. So don't go threatening to walk every five minutes. And since this is about training, you dump whatever it is you need to dump as far as those pills are concerned. I don't want to see `em."
tito,My brother said he was at the strip club and saw Mr. C fighting MMA---
nash,What's MMA?
stephon,"Mixed Martial Arts. Like, different styles of fighting."
kc,Your brother's a liar.
brendan,Take your seats.
tito,"Yo, Mr. C. My brother was at the titty bar last night and said you was choking brothers out. What's up? Is it true?"
stephon,"Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, did you really work on some fools or something?"
kc,You have to tell us.
brendan,"C'mon, it's not as bad as it looks."
joe zito,"Are you being literal or figurative? Because literally it looks bad. And figuratively it looks even worse. The superintendent's coming by in a few minutes. So gimme a little help here, Brendan. Can you explain to me what the hell you were doing?"
brendan,"I need the money, Joe."
joe zito,"Yeah, but we can't have this. This isn't moonlighting at Applebee's for Christ's sake."
brendan,"Actually, I used to be one of those animals."
joe zito,"Yeah, I guess you did."
brendan,"Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just--"
joe zito,"Listen, the school district's not going to tolerate school teachers cockfighting in strip clubs."
brendan,It was the parking lot of a strip club.
joe zito,"Wherever it was, you can't be doing it, alright? I mean this is a serious--shit, he's here."
brendan,What are we gonna do?
joe zito,"You say yes, sir. And you say no, sir. And you say it'll never happen again, sir. And then we just pray to God he's in a good mood."
tess,What are you doing?
brendan, How'd it go?
tess,"They're gonna review your case at the end of the semester, but until then you're suspended without pay. Joe gave me the number of his attorney."
brendan,How the hell are we gonna pay for an attorney?
tess,He talked to me for free. As a favor to Joe.
brendan,That was nice.
tess,He said there's no precedent for this. You'll be back by next semester.
brendan,Next semester?
tess,"You're gonna put yourself through this over and over, for five hundred bucks a pop?"
brendan,Some of them pay a little more than that.  I would have had to bounce for a month to make what I made in two hours last night.
tess,What are we gonna tell the girls?
brendan,"It'll be fine. I'll just leave the house as usual, except now I'll be going to the gym."
paddy," Oh the duck says quack and the cow says moo, and the old red rooster says cock-a-doodle-doo. Cock-a- doodle-doo."
tommy,"Yeah, I'll tell ya something. You can take that thing back to where you found it. And you can leave the coffee in the pot. I can pour that myself. I can wake myself up, too."
paddy,OK. Hurt my knees coming up and down those stairs anyway. 
bradford,What's that?
bradford,"Who's ""Mad Dog"" Grimes?"
bradford,"Wait, rewind that."
bradford,"AV, I need to see the tape!"
av,What tape?
bradford,The tape.
bradford,Freeze.
frank,Let the music sink in to you. This is Beethoven. Breathe. Breathe.
brendan,"Liking the place, Frank."
frank,"Thank you, brother.  You see this beast? Marco Santos? I'm training him for Sparta."
brendan,"Amazing, man."
frank,Come on back.
frank,"You look good, brother. How're the girls?"
brendan,Good. Good. I had another little one. Rosie.
frank,"I know. Johnny C. told me she was in the hospital for a bit. I was gonna call, but then time went by. I don't know. I'm a piece of shit. I should have called."
brendan,It's alright.
frank,"No, Brendan. I'm sorry."
brendan,It's all good. She's good now.
frank,"It's great to see you, man. So everything's going good?"
brendan,"Yeah. Well, I've got a little problem. The guys at the bank want to take my house away. That's kind of why I came to see you, actually."
frank,"I've got most of my dough tied up in this joint, but how much do you need?"
brendan,"I didn't come here for a loan, Frank.  I was hoping you'd train me."
frank,Train you for what?
brendan,I want to get back in the cage.
frank,You're serious?
brendan,I just won an event the other night.
frank,"Ah, you won an event.  That's what this is. Let me guess, it was in a parking lot. DJ from the local radio station. Couple of ring card girls you wouldn't bang on a dare. Am I right?"
brendan,Ish.
frank,"Ish. Brendan. I love you. I do. But why would I train you? When you were in shape and on the right side of 30 you were barely a .500 fighter. You never listened to me. You never listened to anyone. These guys are animals. I mean, you're a teacher, right? What're you gonna do? You're gonna come down here for a couple days a week after detention? You're gonna skip out of the girl's volleyball game early?"
brendan,I've got loads of time. Time's not an issue. The parking lot thing kinda got me suspended. I need to keep working the smokers.
frank,"Tess know about this?  Yeah? `Cause the last time you fought, I got read the riot act sitting in a hospital waiting room. You remember that?"
brendan,No. I was unconscious.
frank,"She's not gonna come down here with the two puppies, screaming at Frank?"
brendan,"It's not gonna happen. Come on. Whattya say, Frank?"
frank,"What do I say? What am I gonna say to you? No? I mean, all my time is wrapped up with Marco. You come down, I'll throw you in the rotation, you spar with these guys, no problem. But I can't promise you much more than that, Brendan."
brendan,That's all I need.
frank,Let me know when you're coming down.
brendan," Well, I'm just gonna go get my stuff from the car."
frank,Now?
paddy,"Hey, Brendan. It's me, Pop."
brendan,What're you doing here?
paddy,I have some news for you.
brendan,Something wrong with your hands?
paddy,"Yeah, I forgot--"
brendan,"Phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable."
paddy,"Hey Brendan, have you ever seen my hands so steady? Have you?"
brendan,I'm going inside.
paddy,I've got a thousand days. A thousand days sober today.
brendan,"Well, that's great, Pop. But it doesn't change anything."
paddy,"What do you mean it doesn't change anything? Have a heart, Brendan."
brendan,You listen to me. You take your have-a-heart bullshit and you run it down the road. Run it out on someone who doesn't know you like I do.
paddy,"C'mon, Brendan. I thought maybe we could break bread. Open some lines of communication."
brendan,"You got two lines of communication, the telephone and the post office. Just because you decide it's a special day, it doesn't make it one for me. I got a wife and kids inside and they're waiting for me, so I don't have time for whatever this is."
paddy,I know you got a wife and kids in there. I got a grand-daughter I haven't seen in three years and another I haven't even ever met.
brendan,"Why is that, Pop? Why is that? Do you remember having anything to do with that?"
paddy,Tommy's back.
brendan,Tommy's in Pittsburgh?
paddy,He came to see me.
brendan,He came to see you?
paddy,He's over at the house. We're doing a little training at Fitzy's. Remember Fitzy's? It ain't Fitzy's anymore.
brendan,You and Tommy are training together?
paddy,Riordan. He's using your mother's maiden name now.
brendan,I know what her name is.
paddy,I thought you'd want to know he's back. That's why I drove all the way over here.
brendan,I thought you came to break bread over a thousand days?
paddy,That too.
brendan,Did he say if he wants to see me?
paddy,He doesn't say much. He's just not that happy kid he was.
brendan,"Wow, look at you. Mister inside man."
paddy,What's that?
brendan,You came to gloat.
paddy,I did not come to gloat. I came to get my son back.
brendan,"Well, there you go. You got your son back."
paddy,"I'm talking about you, Bren--"
brendan,You got your son back.
paddy,"Ah, Brendan. I was a drunk. I mean, you know. I'm sorry."
brendan,Forget it. You were always a front runner. You never had any interest in underdogs. But I was your son.
paddy,You are my son.
brendan,Am I?
paddy,"Yeah, you are. I'm just asking you to find just a little space in your heart to forgive me."
brendan,Yeah. Alright. I forgive you. But I do not trust you. Tell Tommy this is where I am if he wants to see me.
paddy,Alright. But they're not different things. You've gotta trust to FORGIVE--
brendan,"Goodnight, Pop."
paddy,"My God, is that Emily? Boy, she's grown, Brendan. Is that Rosie?"
rosie,"Daddy, who is that?"
brendan,Just some nice old man.
jon anik,"Huge news breaking here at ESPN. Koba is coming to America and will fight at Sparta. Universally considered to be the greatest pound for pound fighter that ever lived, the mighty, mythical Russian has never fought on U.S. soil in his legendary career..."
colt boyd,"Tommy? Got some news for ya. I got you into Sparta. Took some doing, but I made it happen..  Thank you and 10 percent is customary."
pilar,Bueno?
tommy,Pilar. It's Tommy.
pilar,Tommy! Dios mio! I can't believe it! How are you?
tommy,Good good. How you doin'?
pilar,"OK. You know me, Tommy.  I was getting really worried about you."
tommy,How're things? Kids are good?
pilar,They're good. Maria's getting so big. She looks more like Manny every day.
tommy,How's little man?
pilar,"He's good. He's a good kid, Tommy. Takes care of his sister. He's a great kid. Everyone's good."
tommy,"You know, Pilar, I haven't forgotten for one minute what I promised you. What I promised Manny. I've got an opportunity coming up to help you guys out. To take care of you guys."
pilar,"Whatever you can do, Tommy. I know Manny would really appreciate it. You worry too much. It's OK. We're hanging in there."
frank,"No he did not tap you! Physics teacher! That's the best in the world there, son."
brendan,You gonna be OK? Wanna grab a bite?
frank,Nah. I'm gonna head home. I gotta call the boys and break the news. I'll call you tomorrow.
brendan,"Coach! Hey, I know this isn't a great time. And it's too bad about Marco. But what about me?"
frank,"You talking about Sparta? Brendan, please. You got a better chance of starting a boy band. I'll talk to you tomorrow."
brendan,It's a grand prix tournament. Which means anything can happen. You know that as well as I do.
frank,That's what I'm afraid of.
brendan,"Frank, I need this. You're real tight with those guys. You call them, they'll listen to you."
frank,"You realize what you're asking me to do here, Brendan? We go down to AC and you get tapped out in five seconds, how does that benefit either one of us?"
brendan,That's not gonna happen.
frank,Not gonna happen. Wish I had a nickel for every time I heard that.
brendan, It's not gonna happen.
frank,I'll make a call.
brendan,I love my coach!
tess,Really? So that's your decision? You decided? `Cause I really enjoyed that conversation we just had about making that decision together.
brendan,"It's a lot of money, Tess."
tess,"I don't give a shit about the money, Brendan. I told you that. We're gonna end up cashing in your life insurance policy before we pick up that prize money."
brendan,You don't think I can do it.
tess,I think you can get killed.
brendan,I'm not gonna get killed.
tess,"Fine, you're not going to get killed. But can you promise me you're not going to get hurt? You're not gonna end up in the hospital? You're not gonna end up paralyzed? We'll have no prize money. No house. Payments for HOSPITAL BILLS--"
brendan,"Tess, I can promise you this: if I don't try, they're gonna take the house. How's that for a promise?"
tess,I'm not gonna watch you fight again. I'm not.  I'm gonna get the girls breakfast.
callen,"J.J., you've made a fortune with your hedge funds, yet you turned your back on Wall Street and dedicated your life to making Sparta happen. Tell us, why is this tournament so important to you?"
sheridan,"Thank you, J.J. And here's something fans never thought they'd see: Koba is here! The legend arriving to fight on U.S. soil for the very first time..."
frank,"Hey. Where'd you go? You can't leave me like that. They wanna talk to you, not me."
paddy,Tommy!
tommy,I'm takin' a walk.
brendan,Been looking all over for you. How's it going?
tommy,It's going.
brendan,I was thinking maybe we could grab a coffee.
tommy,I don't drink coffee. Whattya want?
brendan,You don't want to go sit down somewhere?
tommy,I'm good right here.
brendan,"Shit, Tommy. How was I supposed to know I was never gonna see you guys again?"
tommy,You were briefed. You had the information. You chose the old man and the girl.
brendan,She wasn't some girl. I married her. She's my wife.
tommy,Don't know `em.
brendan,I know you don't know them. Of course you don't know them.
tommy,Why am I looking at pictures of people I don't know?
brendan,Because that's my family.
tommy,And who are you exactly?
brendan,"I'm your brother, man."
tommy,You were in the Corps?
brendan,What?
tommy,I said I didn't know you were in the Corps.
brendan,I wasn't in the Corps.
tommy,Then you ain't no brother to me. My brother was in the Corps.
brendan,"Jesus, Tommy. I was a 16 year old kid. What the hell did I know?"
tommy,I don't know what you know. Why don't you go ask your girlfriend about it?
brendan,"She's my wife, Tommy. So that's it? I stay with Tess and I never get to see you guys again? Not a single phone call? Nothing?"
tommy,"Shit. He's just some old vet I train with. He means nothing to me. From what I hear he means nothing to you, either, so you got balls talking about forgiveness."
brendan,That's got nothing to do with forgiveness. I've got a family to protect. Everything I do is for them.
tommy, You forgave us?
brendan,Yeah.
tommy,"I'm not surprised you made the tournament, Brendan. You got some stones."
brendan,"I fell in love, Tommy. What the hell was I supposed to do?"
tommy,You were supposed to stick to the plan. You were supposed to come with us. Mom needed you. I needed you. You were my big brother and you bailed on me.
brendan,"You're not the only one who suffered, Tommy. I didn't even know she was sick. I never even got the chance to say goodbye to my own mother. You had no right to keep that from me! That was not your decision to make!"
tommy,"You know what? You walk around with your pictures in your wallet and you're all, I forgive you, I forgive Pop. I forgive everyone. But you know what? You're full of shit."
joe zito,"You realize you're supposed to seek my wise counsel when school's actually in session, right?"
stephon,We want to use the auditorium this weekend to watch Mr. C in Sparta.
tito,What do you say?
joe zito,Let me get this straight. You want to use the auditorium to watch a suspended teacher engage in the activity he was suspended for? Am I hearing this correctly?  I gotta talk to your parents. You guys might need to be in summer school after all.
nash,But everyone wants to see it.
kc,The gym's the only place that's big enough.
joe zito,It's never gonna happen.
stephon,What if we get a petition?
tito,Yeah. We'll get the whole school to sign it.
nash,The power of democracy!
joe zito,"Look, I appreciate that you guys love your teacher. I really do. But there is nothing I can do for you."
callen,"Welcome, I'm Bryan Callen along with best-selling fight author Sam Sheridan. Sam, when J.J. Riley conceived Sparta he wanted to create, quite simply, the biggest Mixed Martial Arts spectacle in history."
sheridan,"Five million dollars, Bryan. Five million dollars. J.J. Riley put his money where his mouth is and put up the biggest purse this sport has ever seen."
callen,"It's unprecedented, Sam. As is the hoopla surrounding Tommy Riordan, the war hero who has become an overnight sensation..."
official,"Five minutes, Paddy."
callen,Sam. He ripped the door off a tank!
josh rosenthal,"Gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this."
official,Show time.
frank,You can do this.
brendan,I can do this.
frank,Then let's go do this.
paddy,"Go get `em, son."
callen,"Classical music is about as fitting to this setting as Brendan Conlon is to this tournament. In fact, let me show you something."
sheridan,"C'mon, give the guy a break. At least we've seen him fight before. He was in the UFC. We remember him."
callen,"I remember him, too. I remember him being very unmemorable."
frank,You asked for it.
josh rosenthal,"Alright, gentleman, you've been given your instructions, I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this."
frank,"Have some fun, baby."
zito,Move! You gotta move!
zito,"C'mon, Brendan, get outta there!"
frank,Get out of there! Get out of there!
frank,Beautiful! Beautiful! He doesn't know what hit him!
sheridan,"It just did, Bryan."
zito,He tapped him out! He tapped him out! He did it! He did it! He did it!
callen,"Very technical finish, but come on, that's a fluke."
sheridan,I hope you got a receipt for your goldfish.
tess,Yes!
paddy,"You can do it, Brendan."
frank,Take him down!
paddy,"That's it, Brendan!"
paddy,"Way to go, Brendan!"
brendan,I'd doing this!
paddy,"OK, son."
brendan,I'm doing it!
josh rosenthal,"Gentlemen, you ready? You ready? Let's go to war!"
paddy,"Can't sleep, huh?"
tommy,"How about deserting my unit? Is that really something, too? Yeah. I was on my way outta country when I came across those guys. What was I supposed to do, let `em drown?"
paddy,No.  What'd you do?
tommy,What'd I do? I took off.
paddy,That's why you go by Riordan. That's why the press can't find your service records.
tommy,That is none of your business.
paddy,"Come on, kiddo. I've been there. I've done it. I've seen it. You can trust me. I'll understand."
tommy,"Spare me the compassionate father routine, Pop. The suit don't fit."
paddy,"I'm really trying here, Tommy."
tommy,You're trying? Now? Where were you when it mattered? I needed this guy back when I was a kid. I don't need you now. It's too late now. Everything's already happened. You and Brendan don't seem to understand that. Let me explain something to you: the only thing I have in common with Brendan Conlon is that we have absolutely no use for you.
paddy,"God pity `em! All shall perish except me! You bastards! Stop the ship, you bastards!"
marines," From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, we will fight our country's battles in the air, on land, and sea..."
sheridan,"It sounds like VJ Day in Times Square, Bryan. I've never seen anything like it!"
josh rosenthal,"Alright gentlemen, you've been given your instructions. I expect a clean fight. Obey my commands at all times. Defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, go back, let's do this."
mad dog,It's not gonna happen again.
josh rosenthal,"Gentlemen, you ready? You ready? Let's go to war!"
colt boyd,Stop it! Stop the fight!
frank,"You've got a visitor. Second row, 10 o'clock."
frank,I want you to look right at him when he comes in here. Don't take your eyes off him.
