Speaker,Dialogue
knight,"A tankard of ale, wench."
knight," Some plague we're having, huh?"
knight,"Oh, my god..."
amilyn, ... All fall down
lothos,You must forgive Amilyn.  He tends to drool before supper.
slayer,Lothos...
lothos,You people will never learn.
lothos, We can't be stopped.  This is our world now.
girl,I can't!
man,You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
girl,Why?  Why me?
man,She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
man, The mark of the Coven.
girl,I don't understand.
man,"Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan.  He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth.  They are a plague upon us."
man," But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called."
girl,I'm just a girl.
man,You are much more.
man," One dies, the next is called..."
coach,"Come on, do the play!  The one where...  the one from the book! Where you make it go forward!"
andy,"All right, guys, come on!"
andy," Grueller!  Fill that hole!  They were all over me!  Okay.  Let's run twenty-two.  Grueller, close the pocket, watch out for thirty-five. Thompson, run the post, right, wide out.  Jeffrey, go up the middle and run around like a chicken."
coach, Is that good?  Was that a good thing?
buffy,"Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie."
nicole,You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
buffy,Excuse me for not knowing about El Salvador.  Like I'm ever going to Spain anyway.  Ooh!
buffy, Mmmm.  Wouldn't I look just edible and nutritious in this?
kimberly,"Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored."
buffy, What do you think?
girl,Oh.
kimberly,What are we doing?
buffy,Why don't we see a movie?
kimberly,"Well, where?"
jennifer,Omniplex?
nicole,Nee sitch.  No way.
buffy,No THX.
nicole,They don't even have Dolby.
kimberly,Beverly Center.
buffy,Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
nicole,AMC?
kimberly,"Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?"
buffy,Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.
jennifer,Excellent.
buffy,What's playing there?
buffy, Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
kimberly, Nice ensemble!
nicole,What a homeless.
nicole," So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?"
buffy,That's the plan.
nicole,Good enough!
jennifer,Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
buffy," Yeah, I guess."
jennifer,My mom doesn't go anywhere.  She even does the shopping network. I'm gonna die a virgin.
kimberly,What did Jeffrey's dad say?
buffy,"'Just remember you're in training, son'"
nicole,"Oh, God."
kimberly,He is so bald.
pike,"Will you guys shut up, please?"
buffy,It could happen.
pike,Booo!
benny,Suck!
pike,Wrong answer!  No prize.
nicole,God!  Take a chill lozenge.
kimberly,Like we don't have rights too?
buffy,Ignore them.
benny,I can't believe these people.  We paid money to see this.
pike,"No, we didn't."
benny,"Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens."
buffy,"Everyone get horribly killed except the blonde girl in the nightie, who finally kills the monster with a machete but it's not really dead."
jennifer,"Oh, my God.  Is that true?"
buffy,Probably.  What movie is this?
grueller,"Look at that moon!  It's huge! Come on, guys, we gotta do something tonight.  Party."
andy,"You know, if you would spend more time at home sleeping, you would spend less time on the field, sucking."
jeffrey,"You were a bone out there today. Anyway, I'm booked.  Gonna spend some quality time with the little woman."
jeffrey,You guys are pathetic.
grueller,"Later for you, then.  I'm blowing. Andy, you coming?"
andy,"No, I'll hitch a ride with Jeffrey."
grueller,Okay.  Later.
andy,Headbutt!
andy, Later.
buffy,Nice game.
andy,"Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?"
buffy,Andy!
jeffrey,"No way.  You'd get her dirty.  He would, honey.  He's an animal."
grueller,"Yo!  Who is that?  Don't mess with me man, I'll rip your head off."
grueller," Come on, come out here.  Let's see what you got."
grueller, Forget this.
grueller, Bessel!  What are you doing here?
wally,"Hi, Grueller."
grueller,What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
wally,Could be.
grueller,You think so?
wally,Could be.
grueller,"Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?"
wally, Got that.
grueller,Good.
grueller, What the...
andy,It's um... you had to be there.
jeffrey,You okay?
buffy,"I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine."
newscaster,"-- The fourth such disappearance in less than two months.  The sheriff was not available for comment, but a police spokesman issued a statement, saying that the situation is not out of hand..."
buffy's dad,We're gonna be late.  I knew it.
buffy's mom," Now, we'll be back on Sunday, number's on the fridge, don't drive the Jaguar and tell Consuela my underwear does not go in the dishwasher."
buffy's dad,Have fun be good stay away from the Jag.
buffy,I know.
buffy's mom,"Well, that's everything.  Kiss noise."
buffy,'Bye.
buffy's mom," Bye-bye, Bobby!"
jeffrey,Bye!  They think my name's Bobby?
buffy,Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
jeffrey,"Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh."
buffy,Something like that.
jeffrey,"Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable..."
buffy,What show is this?
jeffrey,"It's the news, Buffy."
buffy,Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
jeffrey,I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
buffy, Mmmnkay.
jeffrey,"Of course, there are... other considerations..."
sailor,You never touched my heart.
lothos,Soon.
jeffrey,"Buffy!  Hey, what's the sitch?!? Wake up!"
buffy,"Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow."
jeffrey,You were having a nightmare.
jeffrey, What'd you dream about?
buffy,Nothing.
jeffrey,"Come on, what was it?"
buffy,Nothing.  It was just a dream.
amilyn,"You have brought us here, and we thrive.  We thrive.  You will awake in a new world.  Just as I promised, untold splendor, rubies dripping from our lips.  Just as we said."
amilyn, Soon...
buffy,The environment.
nicole,The homelesses?
kimberly,"Oh, please."
jennifer,Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
buffy,"Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it."
kimberly,I thought he was doing Indians.
jeffrey,Hey there.
buffy,Hi.
jennifer," Hi, Jeffrey."
andy,Whatchya guys doing?
nicole,The winter dance.  We need to come up with a theme.
jeffrey,"The senior dance?  How about... 'Our Friend, the Beer?'"
andy,'Putting Out for Fun and Profit'... possible thought...
kimberly,Try new Clue-flakes.
buffy,"It has to be, like a socially conscious theme."
cassandra, 'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
buffy,I still say the environment.  That's my suggestion.
cassandra,It is a pretty crucial subject.
buffy,"See, Cassandra likes it.  Cassandra's my friend."
andy,I like it.  Can I be your friend?
jeffrey,"Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'"
nicole,Environment.  That's cool with me.
kimberly,Okay.
cassandra,"So, what are the most immediate threats to the world environment right now?"
jeffrey,"Well, um... litter?"
andy,"Litter, yeah!"
jeffrey, Write that down.
jennifer,"Okay, what else?"
nicole,Forest fires?
andy,Communism?
buffy,Bugs.
cassandra," Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?"
kimberly,"Oh, yeah!"
nicole,Right!
buffy,We gotta get rid of that!  That's right.
gary murray,"I don't suppose you kids heard the first bell, did you?  The first bell was saying, 'Start going to class, it's time to go to class.' In about thirty seconds the second bell is going to be saying, 'Already be in class.'"
jeffrey,We're having a very important discussion here.
gary murray,Why do I have trouble believing you?
jeffrey,"Something from your childhood, maybe?"
gary murray,"Button it, Kramer.  Classes are starting.  Be there or beware."
andy,Man has a complex.
buffy,He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
jennifer,It's 'cause he's so tiny.
andy,"Yes, but what he lacks in height he makes up in shortness."
kimberly,"Let's meet tonight, okay?"
buffy,Where?
kimberly,Cafe Blase.
nicole,Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
buffy,"Cassandra, you gotta come, too."
cassandra,Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
buffy,Bogutude.  Blow it off.
cassandra,"I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting."
buffy," You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework."
cassandra,Like what?
buffy,Like my homework.
kimberly,I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
buffy,"Kimberly, it's the senior dance."
nicole,"If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that."
kimberly,Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
nicole,"Well, look who's here."
waitress,Hey!
benny,The Fifties are over.
pike, We have to learn to let go.
waitress,"Don't give me any trouble, okay?"
pike,No trouble.  We just want to eat.
pike," Come on, come on, fork up the scub."
benny,"That's it, man.  That's the whole story."
pike,"We're looking at a dog, possible coffee..."
pike, It's coffee.
benny,Amazing!
kimberly, Smell of booze much.
nicole,Nice much.
pike," Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?"
buffy,You guys are thrashed.
jennifer, What are you talking to them for?
benny, What did you say?
pike,"Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?"
buffy,Buffy.
benny,Figures.
pike,Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
pike," The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though."
kimberly,Wit-tay.
pike,I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
kimberly,Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
pike,"Hey, wait a minute..."
benny,You're the guys from the movie!
pike, We hate you guys!
pike, You guys were way rude.  It was shocking.
nicole,You just snuck in anyway.
pike,"So you have to ruin the movie for us?  You know, other people have feelings, too."
kimberly,I am so sure.
benny,"Hey, Buffy, you hungry?  I got something for you..."
benny, Hey!  She wasted my dog!
pike, Bummer metaphor.
benny,Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
pike,You didn't like them.
benny,"They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them."
pike,Would you sleep with them?
benny,"Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God."
pike,"Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?"
benny,"I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you."
pike,"Oh, yeah, and then you'll never call me."
nicole,"Come one, that was so weird."
buffy," What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half."
kimberly,I can't believe they still ate it.
jennifer, Where'd you learn how to do that?
buffy,I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
kimberly,"Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National."
buffy, Get a boob job.
nicole,It's like when we took gymnastics in eighth grade.
jennifer,What happened?
nicole,"Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke."
jennifer,You're kidding.
nicole,"Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels."
jennifer,"Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit."
nicole,"Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --"
nicole, -- like she's gonna kill me.
buffy,I was just scared is all.
nicole,No.  It was mondo bizarro.
kimberly,"Buffy, the ape-woman."
nicole,"Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?"
pike,"I'll have it running in a week. It's be beauty.  It just needs new shocks, you know, break pads, an engine, and some wheels.  It'll be totally cherry."
benny,"When you get your car together, man, let's bail."
pike,You think?  Split?
benny,Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
pike,"Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans."
benny,I think I'm gonna ralf.
pike,"Don't worry, Benny.  I'm here for you."
pike," I'm here for you, Ralf."
amilyn,You wanna go for a ride?
jennifer,"What was the step after...  The one from Thursday.  I never learned it right, I don't think."
buffy,That is so cool.
nicole,Thank you very much.
buffy,Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
jennifer,"Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth."
buffy,Don't tread on the earth?
nicole,I don't get it.
buffy,"How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to."
jennifer,I never thought of that.
nicole,I gotta bail.  You coming?
buffy,You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
nicole,Cassandra's really smart.
buffy,"Yeah... She's okay, though."
nicole,I guess.
jeffrey,Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
buffy,Jealous?
buffy," Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come."
nicole,"Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys."
buffy,B'bye.
buffy," God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death."
merrick,I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
buffy,What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
merrick,"I'm looking for you, actually."
buffy,Am I in trouble or something?
merrick,"Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared."
buffy,What are you talking about?
merrick,"I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy."
buffy,Why?
merrick,To bring you... your birthright.
buffy,"My birthright?  You mean, like a trust fund?"
buffy," I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes."
merrick,You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
buffy,Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
merrick,Wait!
buffy,"You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy."
merrick,You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
buffy,"Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?"
merrick,You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
buffy,Time to do what?
merrick,To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
buffy,"Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires."
merrick,Yes.
buffy,Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
merrick,I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
merrick, The mark of the Coven!  The -- where's the mark?
merrick, The mark of the -- wait a minute.
buffy,"You mean that big hairy mole?  Excuse me:  eeyuu.  I had it removed. And, like, knowing about my big old mole isn't proof of anything except that it's way past medication time."
buffy," Just stay away from me, okay?"
merrick,Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
buffy,Everybody does.
merrick,In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
buffy,I was a slave.
merrick,In Virginia.
buffy,"I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute..."
merrick,China.
buffy,"Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something."
buffy," I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me."
merrick,Lothos.
buffy,How do you know all this?
merrick,I have to show you.
buffy,I can't believe I'm doing this.  I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
merrick,Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
buffy,"Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida."
buffy, Ow.
merrick,Cramps?
buffy,None of your business.  God.
merrick,This is it.
merrick, Robert Berman was killed three days ago.  The body was found in the bushes out by the canal.  Extensive tissue damage -- tearing -- at the neck and shoulders.  Coroner thinks it's a dog.  You sit her.
buffy,Wait a minute.
merrick,Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
buffy,All right.  What do we do now?
merrick,We wait for Robert to wake up.
buffy,Do you have any gum?
buffy,'Bye now.
merrick,Where's the other one?
buffy,She --
merrick,Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
buffy,All right.
merrick,Meet me at this address after school.
buffy,I have cheerleading squad.
merrick,Skip it.
buffy,Merrick.
buffy," They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?"
merrick,It's true.
buffy's mom,Do you know what time it is?
buffy,Uum... around ten?
buffy's mom,I knew this thing was slow.
buffy's mom," Honey, come on, we're gonna be late."
jeffrey,"Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat."
buffy,I do?  I guess I do.
jeffrey,Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
buffy,I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
jeffrey,I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
buffy,'Bye.
nicole,"Hey, Buffers.  You look thrashed."
buffy,Thanks.
nicole,You and Cassandra get anything done last night?
buffy,Oh.  No.  She never showed.
lothos,"I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  To feel their souls coursing about me."
cassandra,What's happening?  What do you want?
lothos, So very much.
cassandra,My parents have money...
lothos,"Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn."
cassandra,What... are you?
lothos,"Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels."
lothos," What are we?  We are man, perfected. We exist to consume."
amilyn,"So?  Do we change this one, or do we just drain her?"
cassandra,"Here, look.  My gold card.  It's your.  I'll never report it."
lothos,"She has a certain quality, this one..."
amilyn,I don't think this is gold.
lothos,"Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless."
cassandra,"No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful."
lothos,Really?
cassandra,Swear to God.
lothos,I wish you wouldn't mention him...
buffy,Fire the help.  No kidding.
merrick,"It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes."
buffy,Our purposes.
buffy," What, um...  What do we do?"
merrick,"There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time."
buffy,Why do you keep saying that?
merrick,Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
buffy,A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
merrick,"Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos."
buffy,"Oh, him."
merrick,"Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention."
buffy, What?
merrick, We'll cover it later.
buffy,"I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?"
merrick,"In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them."
buffy,"Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?"
merrick, We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
buffy,Not a pressing issue.
merrick,"I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?"
buffy,Uh... gym.
merrick,"Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?"
buffy,"Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look."
merrick,"But you enjoyed it, yes?"
buffy,Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
merrick,"Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?"
buffy,"Sporting events, yeah."
merrick,All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
buffy,Here?
merrick,"Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer."
buffy,Okay.
buffy, Who we gonna beat?
merrick, Who we gonna beat?
buffy, No -- you don't have to --
merrick,Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
buffy,No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
merrick,Oh.  Good.
buffy,Who we gonna beat? Who do we defeat? Who will we be pulverizing Into cream of wheat?
buffy,"Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!"
merrick,I had to test you.
buffy,But you threw a knife at my head!
merrick,And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
buffy,"I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!"
merrick,It was necessary.
buffy," Last night.  You knew I was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?"
merrick,I don't think you understand the full implications of --
buffy,Oh.  Sorry.
merrick," God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process."
buffy,Put your head back.
merrick,"Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?"
buffy,No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
merrick,Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
buffy," Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par."
merrick,Your turn.
buffy,What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
merrick,"No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying."
buffy,"Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?"
merrick,"Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?"
buffy,If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
merrick,Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
buffy,My nails.
merrick,"All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?"
buffy,They were vampires?
merrick,Same one.
buffy,Oh.
buffy,Excuse me...
priest,"Yes, my child?  Is something troubling you?"
buffy,"Well, sort of."
priest,"Well, maybe I can help."
buffy,Yeah.  Um... Could you bless these?
merrick,"... Lothos was probably born in the eleventh or twelfth century; he's been difficult to trace.  His power has increased with age.  It will be a long while before you are ready to face him.  We'll be lucky if we can get him to leave the area, to lie low for awhile.  That will scatter the rest of them.  Lothos is..."
merrick," ... is extremely powerful, but he is still a vampire, and vulnerable to the same..."
merrick, Daylight is still his enemy.  The stake can still find his heart.
merrick, I have huge antlers growing out of my buttocks.
buffy, What!?!
merrick,Try to pay attention.
gary murray,"Well, I think we can safely say that something's going on with you, Buffy.  Now, there's nothing to be nervous about; you're not in any trouble.  I just hoped maybe we could talk.  Don't think of me as Gary Murray, administrator.  Think of me as Gary Murray, party guy! Happening dude who can talk to the young.  Me and you.  It's open... Tell me.  It's drugs, isn't it?"
gary murray,"Hey, there's nothing to be afraid of!  I know where you're coming from.  Believe me.  I'll tell you the truth.  I've had my drug experiences, too.  I did a lot -- I did some acid in the Sixties.  Well, the late Seventies, actually.  It was at a Doobie Brother's concert."
gary murray,"... and I could see the music flowing into me, it was bright red and electric, and I felt like a big toaster, and I thought, maybe I am a toaster, we're all molecules, and my friend Melissa, her head looked like a big party balloon, and that scared me, I started to freak out..."
gary murray,"I guess you're surprised.  Well, you know, there's more to most people than meets the eye.  Everybody's got a secret.  I just want you to know that you can always share your secrets with me.  What you say in this office, it will stay in this office.  I'm your pal."
benny,Pike...
pike,"Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!"
benny,Let me in.
pike,"Hey, I'm trying, but this window is burnt --"
benny,"Invite me in, Pike."
pike,"Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?"
benny,I'm fine.
pike,"You look like shit, Benny."
benny,I... feel.... pretty.
pike,"No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something."
benny,The sun!  It burns!  It burns!
benny," Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!"
pike,Get away from here.
benny,I'm hungry.
pike,I mean it.
benny,I'm hungry!  I'm hungry!  I'm hungry!
buffy,Sure is cold.  What a dark night. Nice night for a walk.
buffy," 'Feelings, la la la la feelings'... Boy, I'm helpless."
buffy, Yeucch.
buffy, Hello...
buffy, What do you want?
buffy, Toaster-caked him!
merrick,He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
buffy,Fine.
merrick,And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
buffy,Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
merrick,"You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps."
buffy,"Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject."
merrick,"It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them."
buffy,"Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me."
merrick,You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
buffy,You are such a wet.
merrick,A what?
buffy,A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
merrick,Don't start with me again.
buffy,"Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?"
merrick,Buffy...
buffy,And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
merrick,"What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'"
buffy,"Oh, fuck you!"
merrick,"Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?"
buffy,I...
merrick,"What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?"
buffy,Five?
merrick,Five.
buffy,"So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?"
merrick,Not if you're careful.
buffy,How can you keep doing this?
merrick,"It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers."
buffy,Watchers?
merrick,"There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this."
buffy,I wish you would.
merrick,It isn't important.
buffy,"I'm curious, is all."
merrick,"Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it..."
buffy,"And it makes it worse when I die, right?"
buffy," Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have."
merrick,"As for example, what?"
buffy,"Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one."
merrick,"Vampires of the world, beware."
buffy," Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time."
jennifer,"So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing."
kimberly,"Well, I hope so."
jennifer,Probably was.  What do you suppose she was doing out there.
buffy,Dying.
jennifer,Eeyuu.
andy,... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
jeffrey,I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
andy,Coach knows what abs are?
andy, Got to get some!
andy, Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
jeffrey, What's with you?
buffy,"Don't grab me, okay?"
andy,Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
jeffrey,"Yeah, keep your mitts off my thang. I'll pop you one.  Did he scare you?"
buffy,"I can take care of myself, Jeffrey."
jeffrey,So I noticed.
jeffrey, Nice to feel needed.
andy,Let's move out!
jeffrey, Yes!
buffy,"I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?"
buffy,We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
merrick,"But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?"
buffy,"Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena."
merrick,My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
buffy,"Well, you're on my turf now.  You're just gonna have to trust me."
merrick,I want to die.
buffy, Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
pike,"You said you'd have the part by two!  Christ, it's almost dark."
zeph,What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
pike,"I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy."
zeph,Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
pike,"Hey, have you seen Benny lately?"
zeph,No...  You want me to give him a message?
pike,"You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird."
zeph,"Ah, you'll be coming back."
pike,I don't think so.
zeph,All right.  Take care of yourself.
pike,I am.
zeph,Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
pike,Run.
zeph,That's my guitar...
pike,"Come on, come on.  Don't leave me, baby.  Come on, breathe."
pike," This is for the money, baby.  Make me proud."
pike,"Oh, give me a break."
buffy," I'm on the east side, near the playground...  all right."
buffy, Hi.
pike,Hi there.
buffy,Is that your car?
pike,It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
merrick,Interesting.
buffy,I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
pike,"That's okay.  Umm, listen, I'm not.... I have to fall down now."
lothos,What's wrong with you!?!
amilyn,My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
lothos,Shut up!  You let him have it!
lothos, You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
amilyn,I had him in my grasp.
lothos,Cheer up.  You may still.
amilyn, I look horrible.
lothos,The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
amilyn,"I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them."
lothos," Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades."
lothos, Let me know about our little recruits.  I'll be in my chamber...
lothos, ... having a snack.
buffy,How are you doing?
pike,"Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though."
buffy,You want some water or something?
pike,Water.  Okay.
pike," Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?"
buffy,Not exactly.
pike,"They were vampires, weren't they?"
buffy,Yeah.
pike,God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
buffy,You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
pike,"Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene."
buffy,"Well, stay here tonight."
pike,"Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone."
buffy,Where are you gonna go?
pike,"Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard."
pike," Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?"
buffy,It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
pike, Who are you?
pike," I'm sorry, I just mean... well you seemed like such a flake.  But, in a good way!  I can just keep talking till you strike me dead, or..."
buffy,Things are kind of confusing.
pike,I'll back that up.
buffy,"Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this."
pike,"I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead."
buffy,"It's weird.  I went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- I used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... I went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't even fit on the swings.  Everything just looked so small.  I'm sorry.  I'm babbling."
pike,"No, you're not."
buffy,I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
pike,I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
buffy,You sure?
pike,"Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great."
buffy,Mmkay.
pike,"Hey, Buffy..."
buffy,Yeah?
pike,"You know, you saved my life.  And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost."
merrick,There isn't time.
buffy,"Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk."
merrick,Another distraction.  It's not right.
buffy,Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
merrick,Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
buffy,"I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left."
merrick,All right.
buffy,Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
merrick,"Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready."
buffy,"Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan."
merrick, Football is my life.
buffy,"You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning."
merrick,None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
buffy,And where are they now?
jeffrey,"So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?"
buffy,Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
coach,"Some people say winning is a state of mind.  Can't win out there if you don't win --  -- in here.  I say, winning isn't a state of mind.  I say winning is having more points.  And how do we get point?  By putting the thing, the ball over the.. in the place."
amilyn,End zone.
coach,Right.  So I don't care about your minds.  Maybe you're tired.  Maybe you're worried about your grades. Maybe you dog just died or you've suddenly found that you're attracted to other men.  I don't care!  'Cause we're a team.  And there only on thing that matters to a team.  What that?
team,Winning!
coach,And how do we win?
team,By putting the thing in the place!!
coach,So let's go!!
team,Yeahh!!!!
coach,"There you are!  You missed practice again.  You're benched till the fourth, um, the fourth part.  Now get out there."
grueller,Go team.  Rah.  Go team go.
cheerleaders,Two!  Four!  Six!  Eight! Who do we emasculate! Barber!  Barber!  Yay!!
nicole,"Buffy, Jesus!  You know these steps."
buffy,Sorry.
teen,"Hey, can I borrow your binoculars, man?"
merrick, No.
teen,"You're checking out the cheerleaders. All right.  Buffy, man."
merrick,What about her?
teen,"Everybody knows about her, man."
merrick,Knows what about her?
teen,She's had sex.
merrick,I'm on the wrong bloody side.
andy,Twenty-three!  Thirty-two!  Hike!
coach,Come on!  Do the thing!  Where you... go towards the guy!  Come one! Throw the thing!
kimberly,What are they doing?  The clock's running out!  Throw the ball!
kimberly,Are they so brain-dead?
vampire fan,Rah.
buffy,Jeffrey...
nicole,Buffy!
jennifer,What is she...
kimberly,"Oh, wow.  She's really lost it."
vampire fan,Party hearty.
merrick,Wait!
buffy, He knows who I am!
biker,"Hey, babe.  You want to get some real power between your legs?"
biker,Dyke!  You're a dyke!  I'm telling the world!
grueller,Fall down go boom have to see the nurse.
grueller,They killed me.
buffy,No kidding.
grueller,"The Master walks tonight.  This is his kingdom, now."
grueller," You know, Buffy, I've always wanted you."
pike,I didn't mean it!  I didn't mean it!
buffy,I didn't expect to see you.
pike,I know.
buffy,Why'd you come back?
pike,"I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from."
buffy,Thanks.
pike,"Besides, Oxnard sucks."
pike," Listen, I... I really do want to help.  I mean, these guys are dag nasty, and somewhere my best friend is out there, and I'd like to, I don't know.  Even the score.  Do some damage.  I'm good with damage."
buffy,"Pike, I don't think you're up to this."
pike,I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
merrick,Did you see a girl come by here?
biker,"You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?"
merrick,Yes.
biker,"Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels."
merrick,Wheels?
biker,"My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me."
merrick,Which way did she go?
biker,Down there.
merrick,Idiot girl.  Can't watch over her. How long ago did --
merrick,"Oh, my God."
lothos,"It's a beautiful night.  I have never understood the human tendency to equate darkness with emptiness. To me the black is so thick with life, like soil...  like blood. Darkness writhes under my eye."
lothos," I know who you are.  She's out her, as well, isn't she?  Another Slayer. Who is it this time?  What offering have you brought me?"
pike,Buffy?  What's wrong?
buffy,"Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him."
pike,Who?
buffy, Merrick...
buffy, Stay here.
lothos,"It doesn't really matter.  The names, the faces, they all melt together. After a time, there really is no difference.  One more pathetic bitch, begging for me to suck on her clotted heart."
merrick,This one may surprise you.
lothos,"I rather doubt it, if she was raised here."
lothos, Where is she?  I can't wait to meet her.  Do you think she's ready to face me?  Or perhaps you can stop me with that gun.
merrick,Perhaps.
lothos,"Look at you.  You pathetic thing. So small, so full of fury.  After you've served me for a hundred years, I think you'll have a little more perspective."
merrick,I don't think so.
lothos,Fool.
buffy,"Ummm, our Father, Who art in Heaven, duhmm... hallowed be Thy name. Uhh, kingdom come, daily break, I don't know.  I don't even know if you're religious.  You probably are.  But you're dead, you know. You're just totally dead.  and..."
buffy, ... and I don't know what to do. You were the one who... I don't know if the training was over.  I don't even know if I passed.  You're so stupid!  How could you be so stupid?  What am I supposed to do without you?  You son of a bitch!
buffy, Amen.
zeph,"Hah, I'd knew you'd be back.  Didn't I say you'd be back?  Ha, ha, ha! You're sitting in your old car saying 'Nope, I'm never coming back.' Hee, Hee!  Like you got anywhere to go.  'I'm never coming back'  But I knew you would.  Birds got to return to the nest sooner or later.  That's what I said.  Just like I told you..."
zeph," Hah!  Shot the damn tire, dumbass, didn't even look, just going around shooting things, popped it flat, ya bonehead."
jennifer,I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
kimberly, Throw it out.
nicole,I really was way way too too.
kimberly,"Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?"
nicole,"I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental."
jennifer,"Hi, Buffy."
buffy,"Hi, guys."
kimberly,You were supposed to be here at three.
buffy,I forgot.
kimberly,"Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird."
buffy,"Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --"
kimberly,Oh my God you're having an affair.
nicole,Cool!
jennifer,Does Jeffrey know?
buffy,"It's not that at all.  This is an old guy, he's like fifty."
buffy,"No, no.  Listen.  Haven't you guys noticed how weird things have gotten around here?  Like, people disappearing, people turning up dead..."
nicole,What are you talking about?
kimberly,"Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game."
buffy,Pike.
nicole,You're having a fling with him?
jennifer,He doesn't look fifty.
buffy,Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
kimberly,"Oh, thank you very much."
nicole,Like you've got a grip.
kimberly,"You're so out of it.  You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --"
buffy,Excuse me for having something important to do.
kimberly,This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
buffy,"Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day."
nicole,"So, we're stupid now?"
kimberly,"You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year."
nicole,Except for Prom.
kimberly,Right.
jennifer,And Spring Fling.
kimberly,Okay.
nicole,And the January Semi-formal --
kimberly,"Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do."
buffy,Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
kimberly,Get out of my facial.
nicole,"Well, I guess you got what you came for."
buffy,Nicole...
nicole,Later for it.
buffy's mom,"Dinner's in the fridge, stay away from the Jag, we'll be back by twelve."
buffy's mom," Buffy, honey?"
buffy, Yeah?
buffy's mom,Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
buffy,Maybe.
buffy's mom,What's Bobby gonna say?
buffy,"I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby."
buffy's mom, Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
pike,"Buffy, hey, I've been looking all over for you."
pike, I been working on some stuff for you.  What'cha doing?
buffy,I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
pike,Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
buffy,A dress.
pike,"Dress, huh?  What for?"
buffy,For the dance.
pike,Come again?
buffy,I'm going to the senior dance.
pike, Second word... sound like 'dance'.
buffy,I'm going to the dance.
pike,What for?
buffy,In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
pike,I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
buffy,It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
pike,You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
buffy,"I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore."
pike,"Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry..."
buffy, He did what he was supposed to.
pike,"But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy."
buffy,Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
pike,I should have known.
buffy,Leave me alone.
pike,Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
pike," I'm not disappointed, I'm just angry."
buffy,Buffy?  Buffy?
lothos,Buffy...
andy,"Well, it came with the tux."
andy,Buffy!  Looking tasty.
buffy,Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
buffy," Hi, guys."
nicole,Hi.
buffy,"Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here."
nicole,I haven't seen him tonight.
buffy,Oh.
buffy, I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
kimberly," Yeah, whoops I came."
buffy," You look way pretty, Kim."
kimberly,I know.  I like your little outfit.
nicole,It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
kimberly,"As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?"
buffy,I guess you guys are mad at me. I'm sorry.  I've been really --
buffy, Jeffrey!  There you are.  I --
jeffrey,"Buffy, what are you doing here?"
buffy,I thought we were meeting here.
jeffrey,I'm here with Jenny.
buffy,I don't understand.
jeffrey,"Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this."
buffy,"No, you didn't.  When?"
jeffrey,Didn't you get my message?
buffy,You broke up with my machine?
jeffrey,You weren't home.  Like always.
buffy,You left me a message?
jeffrey,I'm out of here.  Jenny.
pike,I crashed your party.
buffy,Pretty shallow of you.
pike,That's me.
buffy,I'm glad you came.
pike,"Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time."
pike, Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
buffy,I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
pike,"Yeah, well, you're the one I'm afraid of."
pike," You know, you're not like the other girls."
buffy,"Yes, I am."
kimberly,I can't believe it.
bloody student,"They're out there!  They're vampires! God, help me!"
buffy,Don't go near the door.
buffy,Don't worry!  They can't come in here.  They can't come in unless they're invited.
kimberly,I already invited them.
kimberly, They're seniors!
buffy,The first thing we should --
pike, Looks like you're busted.
gary murray,"All right, everybody stay calm.  What's going on?"
pike,"Looks bad, Buffy."
senior girl,Send her out.
buffy,What?
kimberly,They'll kill us!  She's the one they're mad at.
senior boy,Yeah!  Send her out!
gary murray,Everybody be quiet!
andy,"What, are you kidding?  They'll kill her!"
kimberly,They'll kill us!
pike, You want some punch?
gary murray,"I got detention slips here, I'm not afraid to use them..."
pike,"There's gotta be a back way out of here, or something."
buffy,I'm going out the front.
pike,"Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart."
buffy,You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
pike,You say that like it's a bad thing.
andy,"Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?"
buffy,"Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons."
buffy, Good thing one of us was prepared.
pike,"Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone."
buffy,Don't piss me off.
pike," Come on, move."
pike,Yes!
kimberly,It's okay!  I think they're going after her!
pike, I'll bet you feel stupid.
gary murray,Let's get away from these windows! Find something to cover them with.
pike,Bring round the table.
nicole,There's nails and stuff we used to put everything up.
pike,Get 'em.
jennifer,"Oh, yes!  Yes!"
jeffrey,"Oh, baby!"
jennifer,Make me a woman!  Yes!  Make me a woman!
buffy, Oops!
jeffrey,Buffy?
jennifer, Jeffrey!
jeffrey," Well, I'm done.  Are you done?"
jennifer,No --
jeffrey,"Okay, let's go."
jennifer,But --
pike,The heart!  Stab them in the heart!
benny,"Isn't this great, Pike?  Isn't it great?  Finally got those bitches on the run."
benny," Of course I'm angry!  I leave you alone for five minutes, and look who you're hanging out with!"
benny, I don't want girls with good taste; I want a girl that tastes good!
benny," I was gonna change you, man.  I was gonna give you life!  Do you know what that means?"
benny,"Never die.  Never get kicked around, never get busted."
benny, It means never having to say you're sorry!  And you blow it all off for that slut?!  What about my needs?!
benny," 'Ooh, make me a woman, Jeffrey... oh, Jeffrey, you're so atheletical... I love you...'"
amilyn,All clear?
amilyn,Pleased to meet you!  Won't you guess my --  -- name?
buffy," It wouldn't be 'Dick,' would it?"
buffy, 'Lefty'?
amilyn,"You're a fool, bloodbag.  Die a fool and go to hell!"
amilyn, The chosen one.  You're just another bloodbag -- not even fit to die for the Master.  When will you ever learn?
buffy, I do know... one thing...
amilyn,What?
buffy,I know... what time sunrise is.
amilyn,No!
buffy,"It's in about four hours, Dick."
buffy,"Oh, god, no... not yet..."
lothos,I knew you'd come.
lothos," You knew it, too, didn't you?  All your life, dreaming... waiting to feed me."
lothos," Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors."
buffy, Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
lothos,What?
lothos,You waste time.  That is a sin.
lothos, You're even weaker than the others.
buffy,I think you've forgotten something.
lothos,This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
buffy,No...
buffy, ... my keen fashion sense.
buffy,This is the suckiest party I have ever been to.  It's not even a contest.
buffy,Oops.
kimberly,Don't let her in!  Don't let her in!
kimberly, They'll kill us!  Get her out!
pike,Are you okay?
buffy,Get away from me!
lothos,You bitch!
lothos, You would challenge me?
lothos, I'll rip the flesh from your stinking bones!
lothos, I am a God!  A God!
buffy,I am so sure.
lothos,It doesn't... hurt... as much as I had imagined.
gary murray,"Just a minute, you!  I'm not finished with you!"
jennifer,"She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her."
kimberly,Buffy?
jennifer,She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
jeffrey,I heard she got straight A's.
jeffrey, That's what I heard.
kimberly,"The worst is, her parents -- this is true -- her parents were gonna send her to the Bahamas for graduation, and she refused.  True story.  She said she didn't want to go.  It is to vomit."
boy,"Well, where is she now?"
pike,"I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later."
buffy,Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
pike,"Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean."
buffy,We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
pike,"You're the boss, boss.  I just thought maybe we should wait."
buffy,Trust me.
