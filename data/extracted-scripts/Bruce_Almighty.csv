ally,"You're a thing of beauty.     In three, two, one. . . Bruce SNAPS from pissed to instant charismatic TV newsman.  BRUCE For three decades the Kowolski Family Bakery has been a mainstay in downtown Buffalo. Known for their sinfully rich, cream filled, deep fried polski pierogis. And the occasional sugar induced coma that follows. Today, in honor of their 30 year anniversary, Momma Kowolski and her sons Gustov and Vol, decided to do something, a little bit different. Tell me guys, how did this idea come about?"
gustov,"Well,    Vol said to me, 'Gustov, why don't    we make the biggest chocolate chip    cookie in Buffalo?' And I said,    'Yeah, sure.' BRUCE Wow. Fascinating. Bruce steps up to the HUGE COOKIE. BRUCE The previous Buffalo cookie record was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by Gladys Pelsnick. But this behemoth cookie clearly proving that Gustov and Vol have much more free time. The Kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background, toasting with big mugs of milk. Bruce steps forward, looks dramatically at camera, slow zoom in as he speaks. BRUCE "
bruce,"What? I'm cutting that. They made me wear that stupid thing. I don't even look like myself. The hair is one of the most important parts of an on camera persona. Right out of the gate, I lost the hair advantage. Grace looks at a photo, GRACE Oh, my gosh, look at this one. My sister is so drunk. She places it in the album. BRUCE Grace. Try to stay focused here. I need your help. GRACE Aren't you taking this a little too seriously? BRUCE It's sweeps Grace. It is serious. There's an anchor job open. This is important. This is our future! Bruce points to the TV as he says ""future,"" not realizing he's pointing at the ridiculous image of himself with the hair net bun. Grace can't help but giggle. GRACE I'm sorry. Bruce collapses into Grace's arms like a child. He clearly has a fragile temperament. BRUCE  I'm never going to get anchor doing these kind of assignments. I want my work to matter. GRACE It does matter. You're funny. You make people smile. Come on, take a break, help me put this album together."
bruce," Yeah, so full of hopes and dreams. GRACE Oh, here's me at my sister's wedding. I caught the bouquet. It's a picture of Grace overpowering the other bridesmaids for the bouquet. BRUCE You look pretty intense, hun. GRACE Well, I was thinking about you. Grace cuddles into Bruce. BRUCE So, you're attracted to me in some way, is that what you're trying to say? Grace rolls over onto Bruce. GRACE You have no idea. BRUCE I was saving myself for the wedding night, but if you keep this up, I may lose my resolve. Grace stands, pulling Bruce up. GRACE Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles. They kiss, stumbling toward the bedroom."
bruce,"Hey, that's a good line, but you need more resonance. From the diaphragm.  Well then, let me take these clothes off and slip into my hair net. Grace laughs, Bruce joins in as they disappear into the bedroom. CUT TO: A TELEVISION SCREEN"

GRACE We're having a blood drive. BRUCE Creepy. Needles, yech... GRACE Oh, that's a nice response. "
bruce,"I mean, it's just s o . . . GRACE Helpful and life saving? BRUCE C'mon, that's your...blood. It's in your body and I don't think it's supposed to come out. Besides, they stockpile that stuff. They have an endless supply frozen in a warehouse somewhere then tell everyone there's a shortage."
grace,"They do not. Now stop it. I'm                        * giving. I have a very rare blood                     * type, AB positive. BRUCE Well, I'm IB positive.

jack,"No, Bruce.     You can't. Bruce thinks, then flips Jack's sandwich plate over. It scatters on the floor. Jack and Bruce stare at each other for a beat. JACK Are you going to pick that up? BRUCE Yeah, I'm sorry. Bruce bends down, starts picking up Jack's food. BRUCE It's just- this anchor position looming, it's gotten me nuts... He hands the plate to Jack, as sexy anchorwoman SUSAN ORTEGA saunters by. JACK                               BRUCE Hi, Susan.                           Hi, Susan. SUSAN ORTEGA Hi, Jack.

BRUCE  If that was God, then I'm Mario Andretti. Instantly, Bruce's car PEELS OUT, races through traffic, dodging and passing cars right and left. BRUCE AAAHHHHHHHH!J! "
waitress,We've got a special on soup today.
bruce,"No, that's okay. WAITRESS It's tomato. BRUCE Alright, okay. She heads off.    Bruce sits thinking.   Could it be real? He looks at the SUGAR down at the end of the table, holds out his hand and the SUGAR SLIDES ACROSS THE TABLE RIGHT INTO HIS HAND. The CREAMER slides into his other hand. Bruce is half scared, half thrilled. He pours some cream and sugar into his cup, looks around the table. BRUCE Excuse me I need a spoooo... Bruce chokes up a spoon into his hands, wipes it off with his napkin. BRUCE That's alright, I found one. The Old Man eyes Bruce suspiciously, gets up and moves further down the counter. The Waitress sets down the soup, heads off, then turns back. WAITRESS I lie to my sister. BRUCE What? WAITRESS  And I'm sleeping with my best friend's husband. I know he's just using me but.. I'm just so tired of being alone. I don't know why I'm telling you all this. Just seems like you'd understand. BRUCE Okay."

CUT TO: OUTER SPACE - BEHIND THE MOON Earth far off in the distance - And with a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE the MOON starts MOVING CLOSER TO EARTH. BACK TO SCENE Bruce adds a finishing touch by adding several stars with points of his finger. Grace joins Bruce on the balcony and is taken aback by the perfectly orchestrated sky.

The brothers proudly unveil the special cookie and we see that it's a HUGE SYRINGE SHAPED CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE. BRUCE Sure, a little creepy and a shameless plug, but we love 'em.  Mmm, good needle. Remember, that's Kowolski's bakery. The bakery that gets more air time than a high speed chase. Everyone laughs.   The Kowolski brothers beam. Bruce takes a seat as a VOLUNTEER NURSE pulls up his sleeve, revealing the prayer beads worn around his wrist. She ties off his arm, starts to probe for a vein."

As the blood drive continues, we push through the crowd, heading somewhere. Bodies clear frame and we see the HOMELESS MAN sitting on a park bench. His sign reads: THEE END The Homeless Man smiles into camera. We continue forward and in a slow, mysterious, subtle fashion his face slowly transforms into the very pleased, FACE OF GOD, who winks and w. . . e CUT TO BLACK: ROLL CREDITS BRUCE ASKS GOD 20 QUESTIONS"
