Speaker,Dialogue
aron,Nearly missed it!
aron,"Hey. Are you doing the east pike? Can I come along with you for a while? The girls don't reply, just look at each other."
kristi," Sure, I'm Kristi."
megan,Megan.
aron,Nice to meet you. What a day.
kristi,It's beautiful.
aron,Did you bike or come straight from the trail head?
kristi,We left the car there. Pretty quiet.
aron,I left mine at the Horseshoe Canyon and biked here.
megan,You biked from Horseshoe? That's 20 miles or more.
aron,17 and windy.
megan,"Yeah, you surprised us, sneaking up like that."
aron,Sorry.
megan,It's kind of nervy seeing a lone guy walking up to you in the middle of the desert.
aron,"Yeah, I know, I mean there's no one around for 50 miles."
kristi,"... and suddenly there's a guy right behind you and `wait a minute, why is he wearing a HOCKEY"
aron,Let me guess... You're here for the paintings or the Cathedral?
kristi,The Cathedral? We've got a bit disorientated and the map isn't great. Where is it?
aron,The climb's a little tricky but it's worth it.
aron,There's thousands of holds but you can't see them until you're almost upside down and then they just keep appearing... it's a bit of a act of faith so I'll go first... take off as much as you dare as there's a bit of a surprise at the other end...
aron,I swear I won't look but I swear you won't care when you get out here...
megan,Are you ok? ARON!
kristi,Of course he's ok. Listen to him. Aron fills the cathedral dome with his version of a Phish song at the top of his voice. Kristi strips to her underwear and traverses away from Megan.
megan,We've got to go again. And film it!
megan,"I really can't eat all this chocolate by myself... Never mind, yes I can!"
kristi,"So have you got a girlfriend, Aron?"
aron,"Well, there's not really anyone special."
megan,"Ah, so there's lots of girlfriends."
kristi,"There's always a girl, you just don't know it yet."
megan,"Yeah, we meet lots of guys and there's always a girl."
aron,Long story.
kristi,With lots of characters in it.  CUT TO:
megan,"Wow, highest person in Colorado."
aron,Well I figure no one else is mad enough to climb in the winter.
kristi,... you can be the highest person on the continent!
megan,Didn't you see it?
aron,What? No.
megan,"Yeah, it's an old cattle guardian's house - the roof's caved in and someone spray-painted MOTEL 6 on the side. Smelled weird though."
aron,Just like a MOTEL 6 then?
kristi,Why are you on your own?
aron,Solitude. Great tunes. Empty mind. He indicates the wilderness.
megan,Phish?
kristi,Not those guys from...
aron,"Yeah, I know, I know.   See, that's why I'm on my own. Nobody likes me or my band. They laugh as he goofs for them. He gathers all their packaging and stuffs it in his backpack."
aron,I'm not certified yet but that's what I want to do.
megan,An illegal instructor.
aron,It's hard to get the hours to
kristi,"Well, we'll sign your time-card today."
aron,Great. Now put your ass on my head.
kristi,"Okay but don't look and no grabbing now, if I do..."
megan,"Oh whatever, you love it."
kristi,Shhh!
aron," You'll have to chimney down a little ways - like here, watch - one foot on each wall then squat onto your right heel, now your butt's on the wall, so you can move your right foot across, now put your left foot under your butt lower down and scootch your butt down - watch that black part, it's slick, slime, try not to get it on your shoes - if you can get to these bomber handholds here it's like an elevator shaft and just think friction to control the slide. This is a keeper so always have someone at the bottom to boost you out. He looks up to them."
megan,I didn't understand any of that.
aron,Why don't you come with me to the Big Drop Rappel? I can give you a lift back to your car.
kristi,How far is it? He shows them on the map.
aron,"About another 8 miles or so, I think."
megan,You'll never get out before dark.
aron,"No, I really got to do this. Anyway I've my miner's lamp."
megan,"You don't climb at night, do you?"
aron,"No, it's great for seeing snakes in hand holds. Can I get a picture then? They pose with raven feathers in their hair."
kristi,"Yeah, we'd like that. What time?"
megan,Where?
aron,Drive on the east road and about 40 miles out there's a huge inflatable Scooby Doo. You can't miss it. Turn off and it's about 2 miles down that track. Starts late and it'll go right thru. Lots of cheek kissing and his last picture of them...
kristi,"Come on Aron, hike out with us - we'll go get your truck, hang out and have a beer."
aron,"No, I really got to do this."
kristi,"Okay. Scooby Doo, yeah?"
aron,That's the one. I'll have 3 cold beers waiting for us.
megan,12 cold beers!  CUT TO:  EXT. CANYON FORK. DAY. POV VARIOUS.
aron,"Easy Aron, easy now. He keeps moving, descending still, but a little more circumspect. He lets the change of pace allow him to whip round his pack and with the practice of thousands of times selects and plays a CD without stopping, slipping the headphones over his head.  CUT TO:"
cd recording,"Good evening Las Vegas... are you having a good time? Are you ready for PHISH! Whether we are or not, the first song begins on a wave of adoration from his fellow Phish fans. He sings along.  CUT TO: "
phototime,He snaps the log now arching above him well out of reach.
aron,Won't be coming back this way.
aron,Yep.
aron,"FUCK, get your hand out of there!"
aron,"FUCK! What the fuck? How the fuck did you get your hand trapped by a fucking boulder? Its crushed, it's fucking dying man! He reaches up and touches the trail of blood, hair and skin left on the canyon wall as the rock pushed him to where he is. Looks under boulder, no blood - check. [He hears the crowd cheering on his headphones. It's been playing throughout. He switches it off]"
aron,Not good. He blows the whole lot into our face with a mighty gust.
aron,Shit!
aron,Sweet.  CUT TO: 
mark,"Wow, look at the size of this one. There's no cliffs or mountains anywhere near. We look at Mark's pleasant, unremarkable face for far too long as he looks around -"
aron,Cool. He picks it off his arm and places it on top of the rock next to where he's working. It's a grain of sand on the seashore but it's something.
aron,Aahhhhh.
raven,Caw-caw.  CUT TO:
aron,Caw-caw.
rana,OK - lights off and line up alongside me. They turn off their vehicles' headlights as she draws a long line in the sand and they join her standing on one side of it.
aron,"It's three-oh-five on Sunday. This marks my twenty-four-hour mark of being stuck in Blue John Canyon above the Big Drop. My name is Aron Ralston. My parents are Donna and Larry Ralston of Englewood, Colorado. Whoever finds this, please make an attempt to get this to them. Be sure of it. I would appreciate it. He takes long blinks and seems to avoid looking at himself though the screen is facing him. He looks alarmed and wide eyed, startled, in contrast to his slow slurred delivery.  ARON  So... I was hiking Blue John Canyon yesterday... and this happened. He pulls the camera round to show where his forearm and wrist disappear into the horrifyingly skinny gap between the chockstone and the wall. As he does that we  INTERCUT WITH:  INT/EXT. VARIOUS. CANYON. DAY.  Flashes of the accident-almost in silhouette - like an animatic side view. It freezes just before the moment of entombment.  CUT TO:"
aron,"What you're looking at there is my arm, going into the rock... and there it is, stuck. It's been without circulation for 24 hours.   "
aron,"So the way I see it... there's kind of four things happening here... I tried to move it with some rigging... useless... and I tried chipping away at the rock... I think part of the problem is, is that my hand is actually supporting the rock. Which means every time I chip away the rock moves a bit and settles onto my hand again. I can't feel it happening but microscopically, it seems to be, because the little gap over there between the rock and the wall seems to be getting smaller. And this chockstone is the hardest thing here."
aron,So the third thing left was to cut my arm off.
pause, ARON  Which means I'm waiting for someone to come along. He summons up the guts to let the evidence out.
aron,"   HELP!!! HELP!!!! OVER HERE!!!  HEEELLLPP!!! Freaky. We just see an arbitrary view of the rock and sky on the video camera, maybe with a bit of elbow, but we hear his desperation, screaming at no one, distorting on the tiny speaker.  CUT TO:"
aron,No one's coming Aron.
aron,"God, I am praying to you for guidance. I'm trapped in Blue John Canyon - you probably know that - and I don't know what I am supposed to do. I've tried everything I can think of. I need some new ideas. Please show me a sign. PAUSE - Just his breath. He switches on the head lamp and the inside of the bag explodes with light. There's enough light for any kind of heaven but it's just Aron in Blue John Canyon. He looks around his bag. He stops. Silence. Only his breathing to listen to. Heart rate... fast... too fast. Light off."
aron,Still not sure. I'll see you Tuesday.
aron,Always do.  CUT TO:
girl,"That was your Mom! And your Dad called. Call him. We're going. See you next week. Oh, and Rana called.  CUT TO:"
aron,It's freaking me out looking at myself so I hope you guys are OK with this
pause, CUT TO:
aron,It's Monday - all day - bummer. I spent the morning trying to create a 6:1 system ration and lift the boulder but friction between the rope and carabiners is dissipating every bit of force I apply.   
aron,"There's a raven flies overhead, I clocked it at 8.15. I'll bet it's there tomorrow too. I'll film it for you tomorrow"
aron,"I have about one hundred and fifty millilitres of water left. That's four ounces. I can't believe it but I peed twice today, within a few minutes of each other. How is this possible? It's two days since I peed, I'm dehydrated and I had to go so quickly I forgot to save the first. I saved the second in the CamelBak. Will I drink it? It smells foul, and hot but it'll settle. And I can chill it in the sand in the night. It's like Polar winter here for nine hours."
aron,No number twos. Which will disappoint my insect friends. They're gonna have to wait. The sunlight appears down here for a few hours. I get 15 minutes of it at 9.35... and apart from chipping away uselessly at this rock that's pretty much my morning routine.
aron,I keep chipping at the rock but just to generate warmth and give me something to do. I think it's making it worse. I know it's settling more on my arm as I remove material from it. The area where I chipped flakes off yesterday has already rotated down onto my arm.
aron,The blades are too blunt even to break the skin. I guess that's the chipping. It's not even a proper Leatherman. It's a knock-off one we got free in a gift pack with a torch... Mom gave it to me.
aron,"I've been thinking about what my friend Rob in Aspen says to me several... frequently.. Several times that, confusingly, 'It's not what you do but who you are'. I kind of got hung up on that a lot, because I always thought who I was, was very much wrapped up with what I did. That I was happy because of the things that I did that made me happy. If things you do make you happy, then they can also make you unhappy. I think that's why I found myself being as ambitious and energetic - The wind interrupts him and he shivers.  ARON  It's cold... this place is an ice- box at night... And killing winds. "
pause, ARON 
aron,No. No. Don't.
aron,"See you later... ... swallows quickly 2 'spoons' of urine without disturbing the sediment. Tangy and bitter, the saltiness makes him wince.  CUT TO:"
aron," Fuck a nut, Aron. Pay fucking attention - look what you did? He stares at the stain - with all the dirt on his shorts it's already paste. He screws the lid on slowly and can barely be bothered to lift his lens into his mouth."
aron,"Good morning everyone! It's 6:45 Tuesday morning in BJ Canyon. The weather is great! I figure by now that Leona, my housemate - Hi Leona! - has missed me hopefully since I didn't show up last night. Another hour and a half they'll miss me for not showing up for work. Hi Brion at work! Best case scenario is they notify the police and after a 24 hour hold they file a report, a missing persons report. Which means noon tomorrow it's official that I'm gone. I do still have the tiniest bit of water left. Well, actually, I've resorted...I've had a couple pretty good gulps of urine that I saved in my Camelbak. I sorta let it distill...it tastes like hell. So it's 70 hours since I left on my bike from Horseshoe Trailhead during which time I have consumed 3 liters of water and a couple mouthfuls of piss."
pause,"Still, I'd get a drink. He shudders, it's ridiculous. Then composes himself during a long blink and looks straight at the camera."
aron,Ready for lift-off. He bounces his full weight in the stirrups and pulls on the haul line. It looks a better set up.
aron,"Whoa, that's the bone. He pulls the knife out opening the wound more. There's barely any blood. He pokes at the gash with the tool."
aron,Shit missed it. 8:31AM. He's late and I still missed it.

I want to see this through, whatever.

voice,"I did this Aron. I created this. The boulder did what it was here to do. It was waiting for me but it did the only natural thing it could do. I chose to come here, I chose to do this descent by myself. I chose not to tell anyone where I was going. I chose to turn away from the women who were there to keep me from getting in this trouble. I wanted it to be like this. Look how far I came to find this spot."
aron,I hate this rock. The rage blooms purple in his mind.
pow,"Like a gunshot in the canyon, the bone breaks. The sound ricochets. He rises and sees the bone pushing up violently against the skin. He feels it. It's a serrated, but clean, successful break. Still he says nothing."
bang,"A second gun shot smashes around the canyon. He's sweating heavily and yet euphoric, possessed. He checks the underneath of the arm. It's broken too. Around the same place. He can rotate his forearm like a shaft inside a housing. Giving himself no time to wake up he grabs the knife, looks at the watch-  CUT TO:"
aron,"Ok Aron, here we go. You're in it now."
erik,"We are the Mejers from Holland. At the start of the trailhead we talked to a ranger who told us about a car that was parked in the area already for several days and that the owner might be missing in the canyon. We joked that we would keep our eyes open and that we would try to find him. After a hike of 5.3 kilometres to the Great Gallery  where we took some pictures, we returned and suddenly heard a noise behind us, and after that a voice that cried ""Help, I need help"". Monique and I immediately realized that this had to be the missing person."
erik,We are the Mejers from Holland. You should stop and rest.
aron,"No, we need to keep hiking. We need a helicopter - who can run fastest?- You, go now fast. Take him."
erik,They told us you were here.
aron,Who? Who told you?
erik,The police at the parking lot
aron,Do you have a phone?
erik,There's no signal for miles. Nobody for 6 days and then like London buses another couple appears. They too are confronted by:
aron,Do you have a cell phone?
wayne,No. I'm Wayne. I have some medical training.
aron,Is it ok for me to drink so much water?
wayne,"Sure so long as it doesn't make you vomit. Aron drinks more and more, he overhears..."
aron,I gotta stop and empty my shoes. You'll have to tie my shoe lace. As he sits his head slumps forward. He's absolutely motionless. Wayne and Erik try to talk to him but he can barely hear them. A pop song spins round and round distantly.
pilot,Are you Aron?
aron,Yes I am. Can I get a lift?
aron,I'm gonna make a terrible mess of your seat.
pilot,Just get in buddy. We're all looking for you.
aron,"Thank you for bringing me back. The most senior of the burly men says,"
burly man,That's all your miracle days used up kid. You need to rest. You can stand everyone a beer later. Aron is greeted by medics. Needles. Care. Machines. Tubes.
aron,Will you look after this for me please?
aron,Mom.
mom,My boy. My only one. There you are. She strokes his head so gently.
aron,Hey Mom.
mom,How are you feeling?
aron,OK. Are you okay...
mom,"You've been asleep for 2 days. We are so lucky... She's a decent woman and a devoted mum. She looks weary, worn out with worry and love for her boy."
aron,"Mom, I'm sorry I scared you."
rana,OK - he's got 3 vegetarian hotdogs and the tickets and he'll be
aron,So are you guys ok with me?
rana,Yeah. We split up a while back when you were in hospital.
aron,Christine told me.
rana, Is that what this is about?
aron,Yeah.
rana,"What about the climbing? Aron reaches in his bag and pulls out his scary looking prosthetic arm / axe. He clinks the points together. She doesn't laugh, maybe a smile."
aron,I'm gonna finish the 49ers this winter or next.
rana," Well, all I can't figure out is what took you so long to cut it off and get one of these. They both laugh. But he also answers."
aron,"Rana, before I did it I was hallucinating, I saw this child, a little blond boy -"
rana, Not Jesus please...
rana,"No Aron, it's not."
rana,"You know, everyone who cares for you, a little bit of them dies each time you go back."
