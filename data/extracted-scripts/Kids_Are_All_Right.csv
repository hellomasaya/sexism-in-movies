Speaker,Dialogue
sasha,"Oh my God, Joni, there are so many hotties in your class. You are so gonna hook up the first week."
jai,Just cause you're a 24 hour drive- thru doesn't mean everyone else has to be...
sasha,"Hey, she worked her ass off! She deserves some hot jock sausage! Jai looks repulsed, and hurt."
jai,"Uh, maybe because we're friends..."
sasha,"Oh, really...? Sasha turns to Joni like an agent provocateur."
clay's father,"Hey, ladies! Take it down a notch."
clay,Let me go!
clay's father,"Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. CLAY Dad, your pits smell like burnt ass! Get off me! As Laser observes this male-bonding between father and son, we note a trace of longing on his face."
laser,What?!   I'm not doing anything.
nic,Hi guys.   Sorry I'm late.
jules,Don't worry. We just started.
nic,27 fibroids. All in the lining.
jules,"Honey, that's disgusting.   We're eating. JONI Did you do that laparoscopically?"
nic,"That's right, Smart Girl.   And we got `em all."
jules,Mine. NIC Yours?
jules,For the business.
nic,What business?..  The gardening?
joni," Isn't it landscaping. JULES Yes, thank you very much."
nic," Do we have any Cabarnet left? JULES I didn't look, honey."
laser,"Hey, what's up?"
jules,"Laser, no phone calls at the table."
laser, Lemme hit you back.
nic,"Hey, did you start on those thank- you notes for your birthday gifts?"
joni,Not yet.   But I will...
nic,"I just think it's easier to knock them out when it's fresh. JONI Yeah, I know, I'll do them tonight."
nic,"Great...I mean, you don't want to have to start with an apology. You know? Then it's embarrassing. JULES Okay, honey. She got it. Let it go. NIC Okay, I'll let it go...  I mean, if it was up to you, our kids wouldn't even write thank-you notes, they'd just send out good vibes."
jules,I know...
nic, Big girl. You're a big girl... JONI Mom...
joni,What? Laser looks nervous.
laser,"Have you thought any more about, you know, making that call...? JONI Yeah.   I don't want to."
laser,Okay...I was just wondering if you changed your mind.
joni,I haven't.
joni,"Sorry, Laser. I just don't want to, okay? I'm leaving soon and I don't want to deal with that right now.  And also, that could really hurt moms' feelings..."
laser,"God, why do you worry about them so much? They don't even have to know about it!"
joni,"Look, you can do it when you turn 18, okay? LASER I never ask you for anything."
jules,Because if I'm starting this business I need something to haul my equipment in.
nic,"Okay. It just seems a little cart before the horse. JULES What does that mean? NIC Sweetie, you don't even have any clients yet. JULES Well you're the one who's always telling me to ""act as if!"""
nic, That's true. I do. You're right.
nic,Yeah. We haven't done that in a while.
nic,I don't like the guys in this one. They're too shaved.
jules,Don't focus on it. NIC How about the one with the biker gang?
jules,We left it in Hawaii.
nic," I'm cold, honey."
jules,"Sorry.     I couldn't breathe. Jules wrangles the blankets, trying to cover her partner. The transition is awkward and Jules gets caught in the top sheet. As Nic repositions herself, she leans on the VOLUME CONTROL BUTTON and suddenly the porn is blasting at full volume."
nic,Shit!!     Where's the remote?!
nic,"Jesus Christ! Nic flops back, traumatized."
nic,"Well, that was a vibe kill."
tanya,"Mm, flapjack, you're smelling ripe."
paul,"Oh, sorry... TANYA No, I like it. It's earthy."
paul,"What can I say. I've just been out there, you know...hoe-ing.  How's it looking tonight? They stand close to each other, peering at the chart."
tanya,Gonna be tight. PAUL Really...
woman's voice,"Hi, is this Paul Hatfield?"
paul,It is.   Who's this?
woman's voice,My name is Wendy Minter. I'm calling from The Pacific Cryobank. PAUL Okay.   What can I do for you?
wendy,"I just need to confirm that you donated sperm with us between 1991 and 1993. At the mention of the word sperm, Paul goes pale."
paul,Yeah...I did a little bit of that back then...
wendy,As you know the Cryobank has a confidentiality policy which prohibits us from releasing your identity without your consent.
paul,"Uh-huh. Paul heads to the back of the kitchen, searching for privacy."
paul,Not really. I mean I was 19 when I did it. It was so long ago...I just figured no one actually used my stuff.
paul," This is so weird. I mean, a part of me's really curious..."
tanya,So what are you gonna do? PAUL I don't know.
paul,"Hi, I'm looking for Joni Allgood."
joni,This is she...
paul,"Hi.  This is Paul...  Uh, your donor...?"
joni,Oh!   Hi...
joni, Yeah...
jules,Where are you going?     It's your turn.
paul,So...  How are you?
joni,I'm good.      How are you?
paul,"I'm well, thanks. Banal, awkward pause.     Paul jumps in to fill the void."
joni,"Actually, my brother   asked if I'd call you because I'm   18 and he's only 15 which is too   young to call-- anyway, he'd like to   meet you...if you want to..."
paul, Your brother?
joni,"Yeah. Well, technically my half- brother. Each of my moms had a kid, you know, with your sperm... PAUL No.   I didn't know."
joni,Oh. PAUL Both of them?
joni,Yeah.
paul,Like in two? JONI Uh huh.   Like in gay.
paul,Good deal.     I love lesbians. Paul cringes at his lameness.     Joni doesn't know what to say.
joni,I just don't want you to have big expectations.
laser,"Will you quit saying that?    I don't have any expectations. JONI Okay. I'm just saying he might be weird. I mean, he donated sperm... LASER Well if he hadn't done it, you wouldn't be here. So respect, yo!"
joni,Nice to meet you too. Paul holds out a hand to Laser.
paul,"And Laser, right? LASER Right."
paul,Very cool name.
laser,Thanks.
paul,Thanks for making the trek all the way over here. No one knows what comes next.
paul,"Anything you want to ask me, Laser? LASER I...uh...I didn't really have any specific questions... PAUL  That's fine. I'd love to know about you guys. What about you, Joni? What are you up to? JONI Uh, well, I just graduated high school. I'm starting college in the fall. PAUL Oh yeah?     Congratulations."
laser,Joni's the brains in the family. She won a National Merit Scholarship.
paul,Shut the front door!
laser,"Yeah. And she got like an 800 on her Verbal SAT. JONI Okay, Laser..."
laser,What? I'm just saying you're really smart.
joni,"No, I just work harder than you. PAUL Don't stress it, Laze. School wasn't my thing either and I turned out okay. LASER  So tell me about you, Laser. What are you into? Laser freezes.   So his sister jumps in."
joni,Laser's an amazing athlete. PAUL Oh yeah?
laser,Did you play any sports in school?
paul,I played a little basketball in junior high.
laser,That's it?
paul,"Pretty much. The whole ""team"" thing got on my nerves, you know like, ""Hey, let's go kick some ass, man!"" What about you? LASER I play some Soccer. Basketball. Baseball. You know, team sports."
paul,"Hey, I wasn't bagging teams in general. Teams are great. I'm just weird like that."
laser,"Yeah, I like teams."
paul,"Yeah, I've been working on it for a while. I also have this organic co- op farm down the road. We use a lot of the stuff we grow there for the restaurant. JONI  You are?"
joni,"Uh, yeah Laser! I've been like trying to get moms to buy local for forever."
laser,"So, like, do you raise pigs and stuff? PAUL No.  No pigs...  But it's a great spot. You guys should come check it out sometime."
joni,Yeah...Definitely...
paul,"Yeah.    You like motorcycles? LASER Yeah, but...our moms are kind of anti-motorcycle. JONI And by ""kind of"" he means they'd kill us if we ever rode one."
paul,That's too bad.   They're fun.
joni,Yeah...totally...thank you.
paul,"Really nice to meet you, Laser."
laser,Yeah.
joni,"I just never pictured him that way. I just...I don't know...He was so cool and interesting. I can't believe that was him...He was so nice, you know?... LASER I guess..."
joni,You guess?
laser,"Yeah... JONI God, Laser! You're the one that wanted to meet him so bad!"
laser,I know.
joni,Well what did you think of him? LASER I don't know. He seemed kind of into himself.

jules,"Hey bug, come here. We're watching ""Locked Up Abroad: Uganda."" LASER I saw it.    It was gnarly. NIC Where are you going?"
laser,Clay's.
nic,"Don't be back late, okay?"
laser,I know. JULES Can I have a hug before you go?
laser,Mom... JULES Just a quick one.   Please!
laser,Hug her.    That's what she's there for.
jules,"What?    ""Are you and Clay fucking?"""
nic,"""Exploring"" is the word I'd use..."
jules,"And what if he is ""exploring?"" This is the age for that. Why should we care?"
nic,We shouldn't...  I just don't understand why he's exploring with that loser.
jules,"Look, we don't even know what the deal is. We're jumping to conclusions. NIC I feel like he has so much potential and he's just wasting it."
nic,"What do you mean, what am I trying to say?"
jules,It feels like there's some subtext here.
nic,"What are you talking about? JULES I don't know: Like mother like son? Is that it? Both of us aimless, wandering in the darkness, ""wasting our potential?"" Nic won't go there."
nic,"Okay, honey, you're on a whole other tangent and I have no idea what you're talking about."
jules,"Well, maybe it hasn't risen to the plane of consciousness for you yet."
nic,Yeah.   Maybe not.
tanya,So what were they like?
paul,Sweet. They were really good kids. The boy's kind of a sensitive jock and the girl's kind of innocent but whip-smart and super cute.
tanya,"Sounds like you connected. PAUL Yeah, we kinda did."
tanya,Where'd you leave it?
paul,"We didn't really leave it anywhere. Brooke, the sexy Wiccan volunteer, comes up to Paul bearing a basket of freshly-picked fruits."
brooke,Hey Paul. Paul leans over the basket.
paul,Whatcha got? Oh cool. First strawberries of the season.
brooke,"Don't they look awesome? I thought you should have the first taste. And with that, she smiles, hands him the basket and leaves."
tanya," ""I thought you should have the first taste...of my pussy."""
paul,Whoa...
clay,"Hold up. Clay freezes. CLOSE ON a row of sex toys including a fancy pink, Japanese ""all-in-one"" dildo and a few DVD's."
laser,"Dude, put it back!! Laughing, Clay throws the dildo back in the drawer.    Then he grabs one of the DVDs and spins back around."
clay,"Dude, we're watching this."
clay,Think the whole thing's like this?
laser,Want me to fast-forward?
omitted,37                                                             37

nic,"Laser, your mom and I accept you and love you unconditionally? You know that, right?"
laser,Yeah.
nic,And you know you can be open with us about anything.
laser,"Yeah, I know."
jules,"Laser, is there anything you want to talk about? LASER Like what? NIC Anything.     Anything on your mind."
nic,That's okay.
jules,We won't judge you. Laser looks at his moms.       Nic and Jules brace themselves.
laser,"Why do you guys watch gay man-porn? Nic and Jules look at each other, thrown."
nic,"Well, first I have to say we rarely watch that movie-- Jules touches Nic's arm."
jules,"Honey... NIC And secondly, I really don't appreciate you snooping around our room. Was that Clay's idea? I have to say again, I don't like him. He seems untended...!"
jules,"Honey, that's not what he asked--"
nic, Fine. Do you want to answer his question?!
jules,"Well, sweetie, human sexuality is complicated. And sometimes, people's desires can be...counter- intuitive...  ...externalized. Laser looks at them, still baffled."
laser,What do you mean? JULES Are you having a relationship with someone?
nic,"You could tell us, honey. We'd understand and support you."
laser,I just met him once.
nic,What do you mean once?
jules,Did he find you on-line?!
laser,What?! NIC Who did you meet once?
laser,Paul!    I met him with Joni. NIC Who's Paul?!
jules,Why was Joni there?!
laser,She set it up. NIC Forget the set-up!   Who is Paul?!!
laser,Our sperm donor. Jules and Nic go white.
jules,"Look, guys, we understand why you'd be curious about your biological father. That's totally natural."
nic,But why didn't you tell us?
joni,Because we knew you'd be upset.
nic,WE'RE NOT UPSET!!
joni, I want to see him again. JULES                             LASER You do?!                         You do?!
nic,Whoa! Whoa! No. No way.  Nobody is seeing anyone until we meet him!
nic,"Yeah, I get it. He's their biological father and all that crap but it still feels really shitty. Like we're not enough or something, you know?"
jules,Of course I know. I don't want to time-share our kids with someone. Especially when it's Joni's last summer home. No way.
nic," Look, we need to be smart about this. If we act like grubby bitches, we're just gonna make it worse. JULES I know..."
nic,Let's just kill him with kindness and put it to bed.
jules,"I'm with you, honey.  We're gonna get through this, okay?"
omitted,46                                                                46
nic,Paul! It is so great to meet you. I'm Nic. This is Jules.
paul,"Hi, great to meet you two."
jules,"I hope the traffic wasn't too bad. PAUL No, I've got my bike so...I just sort of weave through."
nic,Are you kidding? We love it.  And a Petit Syrah. What a treat! Let me get some glasses.
paul,"Beautiful house.    How long you guys lived here? JULES Almost ten years. Wait, has it been that long?  We moved right after Laser broke his leg, I remember that because we had a ramp for a while, so that would have been...ten, no, nine? No, ten years this fall."
nic, Yeah. Fine.
jules,"Go easy on the wine, hon.   It's day time."
nic,Okay. And same goes for the micro- managing...
jules,I hope the food's okay. Joni told us you own a restaurant.
paul,The food's great. Can't go wrong with salmon and corn. Nic finishes a glass of wine as Jules takes note.
nic,"So Paul, did you always know you wanted to be in food-services industry?"
paul,"Well, I always liked food. NIC No, I was asking because I remember reading in your file, back when we were looking for, you know, sperm, anyway, you said you were studying international relations."
paul,"Oh yeah. Wow, that was a long time ago. Yeah, I was considering it, but then I dropped out of school."
joni,"You dropped out of college? PAUL Yeah, it wasn't my thing."
nic, No?    Why's that?
paul,"It just seemed like a massive waste of money after a while. I mean, I wasn't ""doing"" anything. I was just sitting on my ass listening to people spout off ideas I could've just as easily learned reading a book. Paul sees that his little rant may be alienating the moms."
laser,"See what he did there, mom? You said ""food-services industry,"" then he said ""food-services industry..."" NIC Yeah, I got it, Laser. Thanks.  So, Paul, what about your social life?"
paul,"My social life? NIC You know, are you married, divorced, seeing anyone?"
joni,Mom!
nic,"What?   We're getting to know Paul. PAUL No, never been married or divorced. I date a little, but I'm just kind of focused on my work right now. NIC Oh."
paul,Really?
jules,"Laser, that's not nice."
laser,"What's not nice is subjecting your kids to the same story 1000 times! PAUL  What happened to your tongue? JULES I don't know. I just lost all the feeling in my face and tongue and I thought I might gag and then, you know... PAUL Choke?    Die?..."
jules,Yeah...exactly...
nic,Well it was pretty clear to me she was just having an anxiety attack and she'd be fine.
paul,"So what'd you do for her? NIC Gave her a Vallium. Tried to get her to relax, talk, move her tongue around. LASER Mom, that's gross!"
jules," Actually, she started teasing me and that really helped."
nic,I was trying to distract you.
jules,I know. And it worked. You were really funny. NIC You were really pretty.
jules,So that's it. My tongue started working again.
nic,And we've been glued at the hip ever since.
paul,That's a great story. JULES  We like it.
jules,"Well, I, you know, I studied architecture in college..."
paul,"Right... JULES But I'm not an architect. I mean I was on my way to becoming one. But I quit before the kids were born. PAUL Well, that happens..."
jules,"When they got a little older, I started a Balinese furniture import business..."
paul,Right on.
jules,Yeah.   But that didn't work out.
paul,"Well, business aren't easy-- JULES Actually, I'm in the process of starting a new business."
paul,"Good for you. What kind? JULES Landscape design...  But not like a gardener! I mean, yes, there's a gardening component to it, but the real work is to create unique, eco-friendly outdoor spaces that harmonize with the surrounding environment. Do you know what I mean? PAUL Absolutely."
nic,"Hey Paul, did Joni tell you about her graduation speech? PAUL No, she didn't."
nic,"It was incredible. So full of wisdom and hope...  No, mom, I'm sure he wouldn't..."
nic,"Sure he would.   Come on.   Go get it... JONI  No, it's okay..."
nic,"Sweetie, don't be embarrassed."
joni,I'm not embarrassed!   Jesus!     Give it a rest already!
laser,I'll get the ice-cream. JONI  I'll help you.
jules," Honey, that's your forth glass. NIC Actually, it's my third.    But thanks for counting. Paul turns to Jules, trying to revive the mood."
paul,"Hey, I was just thinking. You know, I bought this place last year and the backyard's a wreck. Would you be interested in working on it?"
jules," Oh, that's okay."
paul,"No, seriously. I don't have time to work on it myself."
jules,"Thank you. That's really sweet. Why don't you think about it. PAUL Why?  I just did.  I mean, if you're not up for it that's okay--"
jules," I'm up for it!... Jules smiles at Nic: ""Isn't this great?   My first client."" Nic looks less than pleased."
nic,"...I'm just saying, the plan was to limit his involvement-- JULES You're unbelievable. You're all over me about getting clients, I finally get one and you're-- NIC He's not just a client, Jules. , He's our sperm donor! Have you ever heard the phrase ""Don't Shit Where You Eat?"""
jules,"Yes, and I think it's disgusting. The two separate, go down separate isles.     When they rejoin, Nic is contrite."
nic,I'm sorry. He just seemed sort of...self-satisfied to me.
jules,"Yeah, he was working the whole ""alternative"" thing pretty hard."
nic," ""I just need to get outside and `do' things, not sit on my ass and learn. But that's just me. I'm weird that way."""
jules,"Personally, I'm tired of minimal. I'm into more is more. Let's not try to tame the space. I think it would look great all lush and overgrown and fecund... PAUL Fecund?"
jules,"I'm sorry, you know, fertile..."
paul,"No, I love that word. You just don't hear it that often.  More is more. Yeah. Let's do that."
jules,"Sorry, I just keep seeing my kids in your expressions..."
paul,You think so?
jules,"Yeah. The observation strikes Paul. Suddenly, he's feeling a kind of fast-tracked intimacy with Jules he hadn't expected."
nic,What's the score?
jules,Pretty close. Laser cranks a forehand that whizzes past Jules.
laser,20-3...match point. NIC So how'd it go today?
jules,Great.   We settled on a concept.
nic,What is it?
jules,It's hard to explain. You have to kind of see the space to get it.
nic," Laser! What do I have to do?! I bought you a card. I left it on your desk. All you had to do was-- LASER Mom, settle! I will..."
nic,"Don't tell me to settle, mister. And if it's not in the mail by tomorrow morning, we're not going to the Dodger game Saturday."
laser,"Whatever, I have other plans anyway."
nic,What other plans?  I'm asking you a quest--
laser,"I said I'd do something with Paul! Laser serves a rocket, whizzing past a flailing Jules. He tosses the racquet on the table and leaves. Nic yells:"
nic,You used to be so cute!
paul,This may not be a good idea.
paul," Clay, you're not gonna make it!"
laser,"I think he may be right, dude. Maybe this isn't such a good idea. CLAY Will you quit being a man-gina and run the camera! I'm only doing this once so keep my shit in frame! Laser sighs, then holds up the camera. Paul looks at Laser, wondering why he puts up with this guy."
laser,"Seriously, dude, are you okay?"
clay,I'm fucking fine! Fuck! Did you fucking get it?!
paul,Maybe next time we can hang out just you and me. LASER Clay's cool. He's just gets a little amped sometimes.
paul,"That's not amped.    That's being a dick. LASER He's not a dick, that's just his way. PAUL Okay...I just didn't like the way he was talking to you."
laser," Well, you don't know him."
paul, You're right...I don't...
laser,"Hey, can I ask you a question? PAUL Sure."
laser,"Why'd you donate sperm? PAUL Well, it's a lot more fun then donating blood. Laser doesn't laugh.    Paul realizes he's gonna have to give a ""non-joke"" answer."
paul,It was a long time ago...
laser,How much did you get paid?
paul,"Why do you want to know? LASER I'm just curious. PAUL I don't know, like 60 bucks a pop."
laser,That's it?
paul,"It was worth more back then.     You know. With inflation...  Hey, I'm glad I did it..."
sasha,Hello? Donor Dad? Stone cold fox. JAI Must you take everything beautiful and make it dirty?
sasha,I'm just saying. Spermster's a hottie. Is he single?
joni,"Okay, first of all, ewww. Second, he's a really good person and I'd prefer it if you didn't taint him with your whore juice."
sasha,"Fair enough, hairy muff. I'm outta here. You love birds can split my letters..."
joni,You want to keep playing?
jai,Sure.
joni,"Yeah, it is. It's really sad. Jai's sabotaged the mood and they both know it."
jules,Wow.    What's this?
nic,Come here.     Sit down.
jules,"Yeah, well..."
nic,You've been really patient with me. I just want you to know that hasn't gone unrecognized.
jules,"Oh god, chicken, that's the spot. NIC How's the water?"
jules,Perfect.    You wanna come in? NIC In a bit.     You enjoy it first.
nic,"No, I meant to put `em in...."
nic,"No, we're planning on being here through mid-August so...  No, I promise, I'm not going anywhere."
paul,Strawberry rhubarb pie.      Fresh from my garden.
jules,Oh my god.     That is criminal. PAUL Have more.
jules,"No, please, just take it away... PAUL You had one bite."
jules,I have another you may as well just tape it to my ass cause that's where it'll end up.
paul,"Hey now, don't go negative on your ass."
paul,"No, I'm just thinking. Hang on.  Yeah, I'm good with the plants."
jules,Sorry. Sometimes I mistake silence for criticism.
paul,I wasn't criticizing you.
jules,"No, I know...I just...  Sometimes Nic can be a little critical, you know. She's a perfectionist."
paul,That doesn't mean you have to be negative.
luis,5 o'clock. JULES Yeah.     Okay.
jules,Yes!    Same time!
paul," Same time tomorrow? Jules pushes Paul, laughing."
jules,That's mean.
paul,"Here, take this..."
jules,No!
paul,"Just give it to the kids. JULES Okay!   God, you're such a pusher! Jules grabs the pie and gives him a kiss on the mouth, almost as a mistake. Before they know it, they're making out."
jules,Okay.   I'm gonna go now...
paul,Jules...?
jules," ...but I shall return! Jules bolts for the door, clutching her pie.   Paul watches her go, stunned by what just happened."
jules, What do you mean?
nic,I don't know. Did you break ground? Did you dig in? I don't know the terms.
jules,"No, we just talked...conceptually."
nic,"Oh, so it was less of a ""doing"" day, huh? Was he okay with that? JULES You know, maybe we should lay off the Paul digs a little. NIC Okay.   You're right."

paul,You got your mom's fair skin.     You didn't get my Mediterranean genes...
joni,Thanks...
paul,Who's that?
joni,"My mom, Nic. She's making me insane. PAUL Why?   What's she doing?"
joni,She's treating me like I'm 12. It's like she doesn't want to admit I'm an adult. PAUL She's your mom.     That's her job.
joni,What? To smother me to death? That's not her job.
paul,"Well, if you want things to be different, you've got to make that happen. That's your job."
clay,"That jump was cake, dude!    I so could've made it."
laser,"You were like 20 feet short, dude! There was no way."
clay,"Yeah, well if Paul wasn't there I could have landed it. That guy creeps me out."
laser,"Whatever. CLAY He's kind of a fag, dude. Tryin' to act all like your dad and shit."
laser,Hey buddy.     Good boy.
clay,Let's pee on his head.
laser,What? Clay unzips his fly.     It's difficult with the plaster cast.
clay," Duuude, quit it!"
paul,"Here, put this on. Joni takes the helmet and puts it on. Paul fastens the buckle for her. They get on the bike and take off down the hill."
jules,Relax. She'll get home when she gets home.
nic,"Quit telling me to relax! They go back to watching TV.   After a beat, we HEAR a motorcycle pull up."
nic,Funny how someone conveniently forgot to tell me they were driving home on a motorcycle!
joni,Mom...
nic,You know how many people I've seen come into the hospital paralyzed from motorcycle accidents?!
paul,I'm a very safe rider...
nic,That is so not the point I'm making! Joni knows this is something I'd never allow.
joni,"Mom, I'm 18 years old! I won't even be living here in like next month!"
nic,"Yeah, well, you're living here now! JONI Yeah, well why don't you get a jump on it and pretend like I'm not!"
paul," Really? You think so, Paul?     Is that how it works? Jules walks up to intervene."
jules,"What's going on? NIC Oh, nothing. Paul's just giving me child-rearing lessons."
paul,I was just saying--
nic,"Listen, when you've been a parent for 18 years, come talk to me! PAUL I was just making an observation."
nic,"Yeah, and I need your observations like I need a dick in my ass!"

jules,Paul?
paul,"Hey.    What's up? JULES Look, I'm sorry about last night. I'm really embarrassed."
paul,"Don't be.    She's the one who wigged out. JULES I know, she's just going through a lot of stuff right now... PAUL Jules, it's okay.      You don't have to defend her."
paul,You don't want to?!
jules,"No, I do! It's just...  I have a guy outside!"

jules,Oh.   Well.     Hel-lo!
jules,Nothing. Paul flips her on her hands and knees and they go at it some more.
jules,You gotta be fucking kidding me! She dislodges from Paul and starts dressing furiously.
jules,What's up?
luis,Where do you want the stones?
jules, The stones? Over by the fence.
laser,That's H. PAUL I know.
paul,"Hey, don't take it easy on me cause you're winning--"
laser,"Hey, can I ask you a question?"
paul,Oh god.   Okay. Hit me.
laser,When you die do you want to be buried or cremated?
paul,That's your question?
laser,I want to be cremated.
paul,I think I'd rather be buried. LASER Why? That's just taking up more space in the earth.
paul,"I don't know, something about the idea of being burned into this chalky powder and sprinkled--"
laser,What do you care?   You won't even be conscious.
paul,That's true. I guess I just want to be in a place where people can visit me.
laser, But why?! You'll be dead! You won't even know they're there!
tanya,"I don't know, some flea market--"
sasha,In Africa?
tanya,"No, more like Pasadena."
sasha,"Well, it's really awesome. Paul saunters up to the table and stands behind Sasha.   He mindlessly places his hand on Sasha's shoulder. PAUL Sorry guys, I need to steal Tanya back now. Sasha clocks Paul's hand. She carefully and without looking back places her hand on top of his."
sasha,"That's okay, Paul. TANYA  Well ladies, it was fun talking with you. SASHA/JONI You too."
sasha,"Okay, I'm sorry but your donor daddy is giving me the sex vibe. JONI No he's not. He wouldn't do that."
sasha,Why not?    He's not my dad.
joni,"God Sasha, that's totally gross! Not everybody wants to have sex with you, okay? Especially when you act like a slut."
sasha,Fuck you.
joni,Well it makes you seem insecure and desperate. SASHA I'm not insecure and desperate! I'm just a normal sexual person! And maybe you'd get that if you weren't so uptight!
joni,Fuck you.    I'm not uptight!
stella,"Oh my god, these heirloom tomatoes are insane."
jules,Joni brought some home from Paul's garden the other day. They were huge!
joel,"So, the kids have been spending time with him?"
nic,"Oh, yeah, they're spending all kinds of quality time together."
stella," Well, it's great they like him so much.   You know, you hear these stories about kids meeting their donors and the guys end up being nothing like they were on paper. NIC No, everyone's getting along famously. Apparently Paul can do no wrong... Nic grabs a passing waiter by the arm."
stella,"Hey, have you guys tried those Aai fruit packs?"
jules,"No, but they're pushing them like crack at Whole Foods."
stella,I know.    Joel's addicted.
joel,"What I do is I throw one in the blender with some bananas, frozen strawberries and hemp milk and I'll tell you, it's sensational."
nic,"I'm sorry guys, but I just can't, with the fucking hemp milk and the organic farming and heirloom tomatoes.  ""Oh no, don't throw that in the trash, no man, you gotta throw that into the composting bin so the fucking worms can shit all over it and turn it into glorious multch and we can all feel better about ourselves."" God! What a bunch of bullshit!"
jules," How about some green tea, honey... Nic slams her glass on the table.   Explodes."
nic,"You know what, Jules?! I like my wine! Okay? So fucking sue me! And fyi, red wine has a chemical called Resveratrol in it, which has been proven to significantly extend human lifespan!"
jules,"Yeah, if you drink a thousand bottles a day!"
nic,"Fuck you. Nic storms off.   Jules turns to Joel and Stella, ashen."
jules,I'm sorry.
nic,This whole Paul thing is driving me crazy! I feel like he's taking over my family.
nic, Okay! Okay. I'm sorry.      I'm just exhausted...
jules,Maybe you need to take some time off and recharge.
nic," Sure, and who's gonna pay for that? Jules looks pissed off, and hurt."
jules,Because that's the way you like it! That's the way you keep control!
jules,"Oh come on! You hated it when I worked! You wanted me at home, taking care of the kids. You wanted a wife!"
nic,That is just not true!
jules,You didn't trust any of those nannies! And you sure as hell didn't back my career!
nic,"What are you talking about? I just helped you start another business! JULES Yeah, so you can feel better about yourself! NIC No, so you can feel better about yourself!"
jules,Are you even attracted to me anymore?
nic,No. Just the check please.
jules,"God, I feel so drugular right now.  I really want a cigarette! Do you have any? I haven't had a cigarette since Laser was born. Do you smoke? PAUL Sometimes. But I don't have any here. Want me to run to the store?"
jules," Yeah. Wait, no. Don't.     Sorry."
paul,"God, that's it. I was trying to figure out how to describe you to my friends. Thank you."
jules,You want to get that? PAUL No. I want to get this...
jules,Did you go to Home Depot? LUIS Yeah.   I just got back.
jules,That was fast!
luis,"Yeah, no lines."
jules,What's that look? LUIS What look? JULES The look you're giving me right now! LUIS That's no look.     That just my face.
jules,"Look, I'm not gonna play this game with you! You need to keep your judgements to yourself!"
luis,"Senora, I didn't give no looks! JULES I don't ask you why you keep blowing your nose constantly! I mean, if you have a drug problem that's your business..."
luis,I don't have no drug problem! I have the allergies! JULES Then why are you a gardener?!
jules,"Look, this isn't gonna work. I'll pay you through the end of the day and then we're done."

paul,How's it going? JULES Okay...
paul,"Here, let me help."
jules,We can't be doing this...
paul,I know...
jules,I'm married... PAUL ...and the kids...
jules,"Yeah, and I love Nic."
paul,I know... They stare at each other and we cut to...
paul,"I got you some cigarettes. JULES  Jesus, what's wrong with me? I shouldn't have fired Luis like that. That was totally wrong..."
paul,Come on. Don't be so hard on yourself. Things get messy sometimes...
jules,That wasn't messy. That was fucked up. I'm totally fucked up...
paul,I think I'm really falling for you.
jules,"Paul, don't..."
tanya,Pretty good night. That table had like 5 bottles of wine. PAUL Wow.    Yeah. Good night.
tanya,Joni's pretty. She's got some of your genes.
paul,I think she looks more like her mom actually. But thank you.
tanya,It's cute seeing you in dad mode. PAUL Yeah?
tanya,Yeah.  It makes me want to fuck you.
paul, Oh yeah?...
tanya,Yeah... Tanya moves imperceptibly closer.
paul,"Yeah, it's been a while."
tanya,You want to meet up later?
paul,"Tanya, you're so sexy and beautiful, but I don't think we should do that anymore."
tanya,What happened?
paul,"You know, our thing is really fun and easy, but...I don't want to be 50 and still ""hanging out."" You know? If I really want a family then I have to stop getting in these situations that don't go anywhere. Paul just looks at her.   Tanya gets it."
tanya, Oh.
jules,I'm gonna do some planting over there so it won't look so bare...
nic,"It looks great, honey. Very indigenous. I'm so proud of you."
jules,"Oh, I had to fire him."
nic," Really?! JULES Yeah, he had a drug problem."
nic,Whoa.   What kind of drugs?
jules,"Blow, I think..."
paul,"Hey Nic, I think you're gonna love this `98 Screaming Eagle. NIC You know what, I think I'm gonna stick with water tonight. But thank you so much. The Allgoods look at Nic: this is a first."
paul,I just mist it with a little truffle oil.
jules, Mmm-hmmm.
nic,And it's done to perfection.
paul,"So it's not too rare? NIC No, it's perfect. Juicy. Tender. Exactly what rare's supposed to be."
paul,"Good. A lot of people in the restaurant order a steak rare and they freak out at the slightest sight of red. NIC Ugh, isn't that annoying? That happens to me all the time when I'm grilling."
paul,Don't people know that rare means red? NIC Right?!   It means bloody!
paul,"Exactly! They should see what rare looks like in Argentina. The cow's practically still mooing. Laser chuckles at Paul's joke, then reigns it in.   Joni tries to insert herself in the conversation."
joni,I really want to go to Argentina. Buenos Aires is supposed to be--
nic," ...So Paul, I was checking out your album collection over there. Quite the eclectic mix..."
paul,Thanks...
nic,You don't meet too many straight guys who love Joni Mitchell. Joni glares at Nic: stop being such a Paul hog.
paul,"Oh yeah, you a Joni Mitchell fan? NIC  Not really. We just named our daughter after her. PAUL Cool. Right on..."
nic,What's your favorite Joni album?
paul,"I think I have to go with ""Blue."" Nic raises her hand in a testify."
nic,"Oh God, I probably spent half of high school in my room crying to that album. That record kills me."
paul,"I know, it never lets up, you got ""River,"" ""California..."""
nic,"""A Case of You..."" PAUL ""All I Want.."""
nic,Mmm!!
paul,"Hey. It's hard enough to open your heart in this world. Don't make it harder. LASER You're right.  I'm sorry, mom. Nic looks at Paul.    Stunned.   Then looks at Jules and points to Paul."
nic,I like this guy.
paul,You didn't tell me you were named after Joni M.
joni,It's just so dorky. I don't really like to bring it up.
paul,I think it's cool. NIC  Hey Paul. Where's your bathroom?
paul,Just around there.
nic,You know what? I think I will try some of that Screaming Eagle.
cut to,"Nic on her knees in Paul's shower, pulling a clump of tell- tale red hair from the drain."
cut to,Nic skulks out of the bathroom.   She looks out and b-lines for the bedroom.
cut to,Nic pulling pillows off Paul's bed.   Her look tells us she's found hair here as well.

jules," Well, you and Paul seemed to get on like gang-busters..."
nic,"You're sleeping with him, aren't you. JULES  What?"
nic,Just be honest with me. Don't make me feel crazier than I feel right now!
jules,Where is this coming from?!
nic,"I found your hair in his drain! JULES  What? I was working.    I got dirty so I took a shower. NIC Oh yeah?   You take a nap, too?"
jules,"No! NIC What, are you straight now?!"
jules,"No. It has nothing to do with that!  I've just felt so cut off from you lately... NIC Oh, right, so it's my fault!"
jules,No! Who said anything about fault? Just listen to me!
nic,I'm listening!   What?!
jules,I just needed... NIC What?   To be fucked?
jules,"No, appreciated!"
nic,"It's always what I'm not doing for you, isn't it? Well here's what I don't to you. I don't work out my issues by fucking other people!"
nic,"No, you had to go fuck our sperm donor! You couldn't have picked a more painful way to hurt me..."
jules,Where are you going?! NIC I need water! My mouth is dry!
jules,Hey Laser.     Honey?
laser,What?
jules,"Listen, I know you and Joni heard what's going on. I just want you to know that what happened with Paul and me is over. There's nothing going on now. LASER Okay."
jules,"I know you might need some time to process your feelings around this, but I just want you to know that I'm here for you if you want to talk about anything.  Is there anything you want to talk about?"
laser, Not really.
jules, Okay then. Go back to sleep.
joni,I don't want to talk to you.
jules,Can we just--
joni,I said I don't want to talk to you!!
jules,Okay.   I'm sorry.
joni,She's a wreck. I've never seen her like this before.
paul,"Hey Joni, how you doing?"
joni,You're such a phony.
paul,Excuse me?
joni,You act like you're so groovy and together but you're not. You're a shitty person!
paul,What happened? JONI With my mom?!
paul,"Listen, can I just come and talk with you--"
joni,What's wrong with you?! PAUL Joni...
joni,Don't call me anymore. Joni hangs up and start crying.    Sasha hugs her.
jules,"Oh my god, I'm so sorry.   I should have called you. Jules sucks a big, anxious drag off a cigarette."
paul,What happened? JULES Nic saw my hair in your bathroom.
paul,The other night.
jules,Yeah. PAUL Fuck...
jules,Yeah. Beat.
paul,"Listen, it's all out in the open now. Let's make this happen."
jules,Paul...
paul,"No, I'm serious. Fuck it. Let's get the kids together and do this thing."
jules,"Paul, come on..."
paul,No! I'm sick of this life. I want a family. I'm ready--
jules," Jesus, Paul! I'm gay!"
joni,"You're excused.  Hey, can I talk to you?"
jai,Joni...Joni...
joni,What?
joni,"Yeah, I'm fine... Joni pulls free and escapes, leaving a confused Jai in her wake."
jules,Just getting another pillow.   The couch is kind of saggy.
nic,Is your back okay? Jules perks up: is this an invitation to share the bed again?
jules,It's a little ache-y. NIC You should take some Advil.
jules,Hey.    How was the party?
joni,Fine.
jules,How big was it? JONI I don't know. Medium...ish...
joni,"No. Nic enters from the stairs, having caught the last piece."
nic,I hope you had a designated driver. JONI Why?    I'm not drunk.
nic,"Well, you seem drunk to me."
joni,"Yeah, well, you should know. NIC  What did you just say to me?!"
joni,I'm going to bed.
nic,"No, you're not!    I'm not done talking to you!"
joni,What do you want from me?! I did everything you wanted! I got all A's! I got in everywhere I applied! Now you can show everybody what a perfect family you have! JULES Don't talk to your mom like that! Joni spins to face Jules.
joni,You're really gonna tell me how to act? Now?!
jules,"Hey, I'm still your mother. JONI Whatever..."
nic,Did you pack that lamp I gave you?
joni,"Yeah. NIC Well, we can always get stuff up there, too, if you need it, I mean if the room's dark or you need extra bedding... JONI I'm not going to Siberia, mom."
paul,I needed to talk to you before you left. JONI There's nothing to talk about.
paul,I just want to apologize again for what happened. I can't tell you how much I regret it.
joni,I don't know... Joni looks down welling up.
nic,"You've got some balls, mister!"
paul,"Nic, hold on..."
nic,"No, you hold on! Let me tell you something, you really hurt my kids! PAUL Well, they're kinda my..."
nic," No! They're not. This is not your family. This is my family! You're just a fucking interloper... Jules joins Nic, concerned things are getting out of hand."
paul,I didn't mean to hurt anyone... Paul and Jules share a look as Nic deals the coup de grace.
nic,"If you want a family so much, go out and make one of your own! Nic heads back inside and slams the door behind her."
joni,"Guys, it's okay.   I got it."
nic,We had to move the car.
joni,I thought you left. JULES We wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.
nic,Give us some credit.
joni,Sorry to leave you alone with them.
laser,"It's okay.     I can handle it. Laser backs up. Then the moms both come up and hug Joni, tears streaming down their faces."
joni,"Guys, come on...  Look, I'll talk to you soon."
laser,I don't think you guys should break up. A long beat.
nic,No?   Why's that? LASER I think you're too old.
nic,"Thanks, Laser."
fade out,THE END
