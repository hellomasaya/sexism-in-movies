gene,Lynn!  Lynn!!
gene,"Lynn, don't walk ahead of me, OK?"
gene,"I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?"
lynn,Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
gene,We made it.
lynn,We made it.
gene,"I gotta make a phone call, Lynn. Do you see a phone?"
gene,"Come on, you."
gene, Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
lynn,On TV.
gene,You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
gene," Hey, it's OK to talk about her. You can talk about her all you want. You know that, don't you?"
gene,"So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?"
lynn,No way.
gene,How did you see us kiss?
gene,"That's it? That little peck of a kiss? Oh, brother, you missed some kisses."
gene,"Ooh, I'm gonna be late. I gotta call."
gene,"Hello, is Mr. Conners there? I have an interview with him at twelve- thirty. Hi, Mr. Conners, this is Gene Watson. Sorry to call you at the last minute like this but... Hey, hey!"
gene,"Watch that! Lynn, come here!"
gene,"Sorry. There's some crazy kids on skates. Listen, the train just got in, I'm afraid I'm going to be a few minutes late."
gene,"Great. OK, I'll get there as soon as I can. Bye, now."
gene, Ready?
lynn,Nods.
gene,Let' s do it.
gene,Whoops.
gene,"Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?"
lynn,Right.
gene,What?
gene,"Uh, sure. What's, what's the problem? Will a driver's license do?"
gene,"Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near..."
gene,Yes.
gene,"Near Lompoc, north. What's..."
gene,I'd like to know what...
gene,Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
lynn,You stole that.
gene,What is going on?
lynn,I want my daddy.
gene,"Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends."
lynn,Everybody does?
lynn,Laughs.
lynn,Let me do it.
lynn, It's loud!
ms jones,Removes a Pro Label Machine from under the seat. She begins to type in several characters.
gene,Who are you? You're not the police.
gene,You wouldn't...
gene,Get your hands off her.
gene,"Yes, yes, I understand."
gene,"Yes, I'm listening."
gene,You're out of your mind.
gene,I will do no such thing.
gene,"Oh, my God..."
lynn,Where is my daddy going?
lynn,My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
little girl,Mama!
gene,Lynn!
gene,"Yes. Yes, I can hear you."
lynn," He has to say ""over and out"". Daddy, you have to say ""over and out""."
gene,Over and out.
gene, At one thirty my little girl is dead.
cabbie,"Where to, sir?"
gene,The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is?
cabbie,Amtrack?
gene,What?
cabbie,You just come in on Amtrack?
gene,"Uh, yes.."
cabbie,Business or pleasure?
gene,Business.
cabbie,Where'd you come from?
gene,San Diego.
cabbie,"Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money."
gene,Sorry.
cabbie,'S okay. What do you think?
gene,Huh?
cabbie,Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
gene,I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
cabbie,"Aw, too bad."
cabbie,Somebody close?
gene,What?
cabbie,The grave. Somebody close?
gene,Wife. Ex-wife. Almost ex. We were separated. She was thinking about a divorce.
gene,Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
cabbie,"Oh, yeah?"
cabbie,"Jesus! Watch it, buddy!"
cabbie,"I'd love to hear about your problem, but the ride's over. Three-fifty."
cabbie,Three-fifty. I hope your problem doesn't have anything to do with my three-fifty.
gene,Right. Right.
cabbie,What do I want with an accountant?
doorman,I got one for the airport. You free?
cabbie,You bet.
gene,"Oh, my God. Oh, no."
gene,"Oh, shit."
gene,"Oh, sweet Jesus..."
gene,Could you tell me where the Emerald Bay Room is?
gustino,Third floor. Yellow stairwell. Follow the signs.
gene,"Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot."
gustino,No problem.
brendan grant, Whoops!
brendan grant,Nice body check.
brendan grant,"You know my wife has a deeply personal reason for going after repeat drunk drivers. They are felons and they should be treated as such. A drivers license is a privilege, not a right."
gene,"Excuse me, is the...thing over?"
woman,Yes. You didn't miss much. The food...chicken again.
gene,Eleanor Grant is gone?
woman,Yes. Nice speech. But it's the same at all these...
gene,"This says ""invitation only""."
gene,Where did you get these? Who are you?
eleanor grant,They-didn't hear a word I said. The mike was too low on the podium.
krista,How much did we pay for that room?
chief aide,We didn't.
eleanor grant,Somebody did.
krist,A Have Nolin pre-check the PA systems.
bodyguard,"Excuse me, sir, this car is for the Governor. You can take the next one."
eleanor grant,"Don't you dare, Franco. This is one of our biggest supporters."
eleanor grant,"Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial incumbent. That's a mouthful isn't- it? I love saying that."
eleanor grant,Whose idea was it to have a lunch right after the brunch? I'm about to bust as it is.
krista,"We'll just walk through, do a little grip-and-grin, then get ready for the press con."
gene,Governor...
gene,I need your help.
eleanor grant,What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
gene,Its'...ah...about my daughter....
eleanor grant,I think we can accommodate you.
eleanor grant,"Eleanor Grant, gubernatorial incumbent."
eleanor grant,You were saying?  Your daughter....?
gene,I...
eleanor grant,Yes?
gene,She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
eleanor grant,Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
krista,I've got the pen if you've got the paper.
krista,How about that?
krista,Is that something precious?
gene,"No, that's,..that's fine"
eleanor grant,What's her name?
gene,Her name? Her name is Lynn.
krista,"It's funny. I don't even keep a pad of paper with me anymore, everything's gone so electronic."
krista,If it wasn't for double A batteries I'd be in big trouble.
eleanor grant,"Are you all right? Elevators make me queasy, too."
gene,The gun...
gene,It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
lynn,I've done much better ones than this.
lynn,"Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home."
huey,Having a rough day? Down at the heels as they...?
huey," You don't see your face, you don't pay!"
huey,"Having a rough day? Down at the heels as they say? What you need is a shoe shine, shoe shine, shoe shine today."
huey,"Take ten, take a break, take a seat, take a load off. Put the world in perspective."
huey,"So, are you a visitor or lucky enough to live in The City of Angels?"
gene,I'm...I'm visiting.
huey,"What do you do, if I may be so bold?"
gene, I'm just an accountant.
huey,"Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants?  They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?"
huey,"Now you take tips. Time was a tip was between a man and his customer. Not any more. They've figured out what they call a formulae, don't laugh, it ain't for babies. They take your sales, see, and slap a percentile on there, figuring that somewhere between your lies and your bad luck they'll hit on the mean amount, mean meaning ""in the middle"", but if you ask me it means ""just plain mean"". Why you can have Uncle Scrooge wring a nickel over your poor out-stretched palm, or Daddy Warbucks dropping pearl stick-pins like manna from heaven, don't make no difference, they'll tax your behind according to that same figure. Doesn't seem quite right., does it?"
gene,"No. No, it doesn't."
gustino,"Hey, Huey, how's it hangin'?"
huey,"It's a load, my friend, but somebody's got to carry it."
gene,I have to do something.
huey,What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
gene,I said I have to do something.
huey,I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
gene,Is within himself.
gene,Drove me crazy. There must have been one on me. I didn't add up so she left. That's what attracted me to her In the first place. She made up her mind and she did it. She wouldn't sit around waiting for...whatever. She'd do something. She'd do something.
huey,"Yes, well, you know, for a quality shoe you can't beat a good wingtip. Wears like iron. You're a wise man. There ya' go. Two bucks."
huey,You got anything smaller?
gene,Keep it.
huey,It's a twenty.
gene,Keep it.
huey,Well...thanks muchly...
gene,Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
huey,Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
gene,Thanks.
gene,Then I have time for a drink.
reporter,So where was I?
bartender,I don't know. Something about the Governor's new regime.
reporter,Oh yeah. She's dumping the Good Old Boys like yesterday's newspapers.
reporter,The white boys are in for it. When they got her elected they never thought she was gonna make the Governor's office look like the United Nations.
reporter,We're talking Custer's Last Stand here. The only minorities not on her staff are the ones still lost in the Rain Forest.
gene, Lynn!
gene,Pool Deck?
hector,Fourth Floor. Take that escalator.
brendan grant,My wife is not interested in negative campaigning. She wants to accentuate the positive. I don't know about you but I find that refreshing.
a reporter,Have you ever thought of running for office yourself?
brendan grant, Me?
brendan grant,I'm just a business man.
gene,What would you do in my place?
gene,"There's a plot to kill the Governor. If you don't believe me, check that guy right there. He has a gun."
officer trust,"So do you, Mr. Watson."
officer trust,You got this under control?
officer trust,It doesn't look like it.
officer trust,It better be.
gene,What...?
gene,He's dead?
gene,How should I...?
gene,You killed him.
tom bradley,It is my extreme pleasure this afternoon to introduce to you...
tom bradley,...a woman who can only be characterized as a one-of-a-kind.
tom bradley,An iconoclast with class...
krista,The elevator. You weren't feeling well.
tom bradley,A genuine lady who's not afraid to get into the trenches...
krista,Are you better now?
tom bradley,...and go to the mat with greedy special interests...
tom bradley,The finest Governor our state has ever had...
tom bradley,"My friend and yours, Governor Eleanor Grant!"
gene,My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
krista,"Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant."
gene,You don't understand. I'm going to trust you. And you have to trust me.
krista,"Yes, you're right, I don't understand."
gene,Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
krista,"Sure, sure, I'll help you. Let me get Mr. White. I'm sure he can assist you, he's our..."
gene, No! You have to listen to me.
krista,"I'm listening, I'm listening."
eleanor grant,"My friends, my good friends..."
gene,Please...please...you have to believe me... They have my daughter.  They want me to kill Eleanor Grant  or they'll kill my daughter.
krista,"All right, let's just...let's get security in on this."
gene,No! You can't! They're in on it.
krista,I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked.
gene,I don't know. One of them is following me. If he knew what I'd just told you they'd...
gene,"Look, how did I get in here with this!?"
krista,I don't know.
gene,"You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me."
krista,It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.
gene,"You're right, it is.  Here."
gene,Will you trust me now?
krista,"I guess I'll have to. Come on, there's one person we can go to."
gene,The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
krista,He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
krista,We've got about ten minutes.
gene,Are you sure?
krista,I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
gene,But...
krista,Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
gene,Okay...
gene,Hey.
gene,I think you better put that away.
krista,I think you're right.
eleanor grant,"But tragedy, if it doesn't destroy us, has a curious way of giving us strength."
eleanor grant,"I doubt if I would be before you now, if I hadn't been put through that crucible of loss."
eleanor grant,And though I can never forget William and Bill Junior or the love I felt for them...
eleanor grant,I have found joy again in serving this great state. I have found love again in my second husband Brendan...
gene,Where are we going?
hall guard,Ms. Brooks ...
krista,Is he in?
hall guard,"Yes, ma'am."
gene,Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
krista,I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
brendan grant,What is it? Is there a problem?
krista,"We need to see you, Brendan."
gene, We have to hurry.
krista,"I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor."
brendan grant,What? What are you talking about?
krista,"We need people we can ""trust. We only have a few moments..."
brendan grant,This is...this is insane. How do you know this?
gene,I know it because I'm the one who's supposed to kill her.
brendan grant,You are!?  You brought this man here!? You brought this man to my room!?
krista,I had to. Her Security people may be involved...
mystery man,"Is there a problem, Brendan?"
brendan grant,There certainly is. This man says he's been hired to kill Eleanor.
gene,Not hired. They're blackmailing me.
mystery man,"Who is this ""they""?"
gene,"I don't...I don't know. Please, Mr. Grant! They have my daughter. I'm not some lunatic. Your wife is in trouble.  Someone is trying to kill her. Someone is trying to make me kill her. Please, listen..."
mystery man,"And on the strength of this story, you bring this man to Brendan's suite? Does that show good judgment, Ms. Brooks?  I'm just a friend of Brendan's, but it seems to me..."
krista,He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
mystery man, What?
krista,He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
mystery man,I see. Where is this gun?
mystery man,"Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?"
krista,It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
mystery man,Could I see it?
mystery man,My goodness. It certainly looks real.
mystery man,"What's your opinion? You're the expert in these matters, supposedly."
brendan grant,Jesus Christ!
mystery man,Are you out of your fucking mind!?
officer trust,Somebody mind telling me...  What the hell happened!?
brendan grant,What have you done to me!? Christ almighty!
gene,No!
mystery man,Don't let him go!
gene,I killed you.
brendan grant,"I'm on record. I never wanted this. I wanted simplicity; a telescopic sight, a powerful rifle, but no. What was good enough for Oswald wasn't good enough for you two. You had to get fancy. Drag some shmuck in off the street, stick a gun in his hand."
mystery man,It's academic now. She had to be killed.
mystery man, Is he awake?
brendan grant,Oh Great. Why don't we just give him our home phone numbers while we're at it?
mystery man,Get going. You've only got a few minutes to pull it together.
mystery man,It's too late for that.
brendan grant,There is a dead woman on my bathroom floor!
mystery mam,"What about it? She's Eleanor's assistant and they will have been shot with the same gun, by the same lunatic.  Some, anonymous loser who went over the edge."
brendan grant, Only thing better would be if he were a postal worker.
officer trust,He won't be doing any work once I get through with him.
mystery man,And in a few months you're in the Governor's mansion. The people'd make you king of California if they could.
gene,"I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work."
gene,I kill her - and you kill me.
gene,"Even if you don't, Her Security men will."
gene,How am I supposed to get away?
gene,How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
gene,And I'm supposed to trust you?
gene,Lynn!
gene," No, please..."
huey," Take ten, take a break, take a seat, take a load off. Put the world in perspective."
huey,"So, are you a visitor or are you lucky enough to..."
huey, You got a complaint?
gene,You remember me?
huey,I remember. The big tipper.
gene,Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
huey,"Oh, man..."
gene,Please. Something is going to happen...
huey,"What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair."
gene,Please...
huey,"Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?"
gene,He's deaf.
gene,He can't hear a word we're saying.
huey,"Why, looky-here. My customer-quotient just got multiplied by two. What do you think of that?  You'll have to forgive me, sir. Didn't hear your approach. Fact of the matter is, I'm deef as a post. Compliments of the United States Army...  ...Artillery Corps. Can I give you a shine, sir? You don't see your face, you don't pay."
gene,One thirty. California Ballroom.
gene,Let me talk to her again.
gene,I want'to talk to her.
gene,I talk to her or you can forget about it.
gene,"What are you going to do about it, shoot me?"
gene,What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
gene,It would be a lot less trouble just to let me talk to her.
gene,"Yes, sweetie, it's me."
gene,"I know you do, honey."
lynn,Can we go now?
lynn,To be a hero?
gene,"No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?"
gene,"He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you."
gene,Will you promise me that?
gene,All right. Kisses to you.
gene,No. Kisses to you.
huey,Just about.
huey,"Two dollars, if it pleases you."
huey,Thanks for the tip.
huey,"Mister, what are you dragging me into?"
gene,I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
huey,Cover your mouth.
gene,What?
huey,"This gorilla's watching you, is that right?"
gene,That's right.
huey,Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off.
huey,That was your kid on the walkie- talkie?
gene,My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
huey,In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
gene,There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
huey,What are you supposed to do?
gene,Kill the Governor.
huey,I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
gene,One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
huey,Who?
gene,The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
huey,"Oh, Jesus ..."
gene,"No way, there's nothing you can do to help me."
huey,Then why'd you drag me into it?
gene, It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
gene,"It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do."
huey,"Yeah, all right, listen..."
gene, So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it....
huey,Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
gene,I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
huey,"Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you."
gene,What are you going to do?
huey,I haven't the faintest idea. Go on now. I'll get word to you.
gene,"If nothing else, someone heard my story."
gene,Keep the change.
huey,Don't think I won't.
gene,I need a drink.
gene,Give me a ...a gingerale?
tv reporter,No shit. If I hear that stop the violence routine one more time I'm going to shoot somebody.
waitress,"Here's your Ginger Ale, sir."
tv reporter,They're all the same.
tv reporter,You know what bothers me?
tv reporter,"When they get all weepy eyed about the ""ordinary citizen"", the ""regular Joe"", the ""normal American"". Gimme a break. There ain't no such animal. We're a nation of two hundred forty million special interest groups."
gene,"Well, I'm just a regular guy."
tv reporter,Is that right?
gene,"Yeah, that's right. But I've built a good solid business out of nothing. Don't underestimate the regular guy."
bartender,"Sir, you haven't paid."
gene,It's on the Special Interest at the end of the bar.
bartender,"Hey, Sir, don't make me call a cop."
officer trust,Where is he? Did you lose him?
gene, Let's all hope so.
huey,"Quick, off with the shoes and pants. Trade with Gustino. The big guy's coming."
huey,"C'mon, ladies. No time to be shy."
huey,Gustino! Drop 'em!
huey,"And cover up them socks. Man, who dresses you?"
janitor,Fue.  
huey,Meet Irene.
gene,Hi.
huey,Irene is going to help.
gene,Thank you.
gene,Where am I going?
huey,You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
gene,Yeah.
huey,You're going to go see her.
gene,What!?
huey,You sure she's asleep?
irene,I took up extra pillows. She take a nap before her big speech.
gene,What am I supposed to say to her?
huey,It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment.
huey, Irene...?
gene, Excuse me...
eleanor grant,Who the hell are you?
gene,"No, please."
gene,"Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you."
eleanor grant,My security people are right next door.
gene,I appreciate that.
eleanor grant,One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
gene,If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
eleanor grant,That's...a comfort to hear.
gene,I have a problem.
eleanor grant,Ah.
gene,"Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant."
eleanor grant,I remember you...in the elevator.
gene,That's right.
eleanor grant,You were very nervous.
gene,It was because I had this...in my pocket
gene,I need you to listen to me. Carefully. Three lives depend on you listening very carefully to what I have to say.
eleanor grant, Of course. But suppose we set up an appointment. I have an important speech to deliver and you're cutting into my nap time.
gene,Krista Brooks is dead.
eleanor grant,How do you know that?
gene,I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
eleanor grant,You shot her?
gene,No.
eleanor grant,Who did?
gene,I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
eleanor grant,What?
gene,And your husband works for somebody else.
eleanor grant,What the hell are you saying?
hector,He's gone.
hector,"Hey, Gustino, what takes you so long? You need to eat more fiber."
gene,I knew you wouldn't believe me.
eleanor grant,"I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?"
gene,I don't blame you. I don't have any proof. But nothing like this occurs in a vacuum. You can't be totally oblivious. You must suspect something. You're doing things which are making people angry. People who have been in power a long time are losing their jobs. You know them better than me. How much does it mean to them?  How far would they go to hang onto it?
gene,There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
eleanor grant, I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
gene,"It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them."
eleanor grant,I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
gene,This? I've never even fired one.
eleanor grant,Indeed.
eleanor grant, Franco! Franco.'
franco,"What is it, Governor!? What's wrong!?"
eleanor grant,"I...I'm afraid I've had a bad dream, Franco."
huey,Well?
gene,I don't know.
huey,What are you going to do now?
gene,I don't know. I have to get back.
huey,What are you going to do!?
gene,This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
officer trust,Get moving.
officer trust,It's time. It's time now.
lynn,Where are we going?
gene,I know what I have to do. I'll do it. Let's go.
brendan grant,"Hey, El, how's the head?"
mystery man,Eleanor.
eleanor grant,Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
brendan grant,It's an important speech.
mystery man,"I'd say critical, not that it's any of my business."
eleanor grant,It's just another speech in a Tower of Babel so high that Nimrod himself would be put to shame. Cancel. Make my apologies.
brendan grant,Excuse me.
mystery man,"I'll trot along. Nice to see you, Eleanor."
brendan grant,During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
eleanor grant,What's he doing here?
brendan grant,"Who, him? Just visiting."
brendan grant,"He's my friend. And he did help you to get elected, after all."
eleanor grant,Don't remind me.
brendan grant, What happened here?
eleanor grant,Nothing. I broke a lamp.
brendan grant,"Eleanor, please. I'll put it this way. This speech or a half-dozen rubber chicken-fund raisers. What do you say?"
eleanor grant,"Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies."
brendan grant,"Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog."
eleanor grant,"All right, I'll do it."
brendan grant,That's my girl.
eleanor grant,But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
brendan grant,"Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand."
eleanor grant,You sent my assistant on an errand.
brendan grant, I've been a bad boy.

lynn,A surprise?
huey,"Good afternoon, madam. Hello there, little girl."
huey,Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
huey,You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
huey,Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
huey,It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
huey,You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
huey,I don't think so.
huey,I think this is worth a dollar.
huey,"Oh, we'll have to do better than that."
huey,Gimme a dollar.
huey,There's nothing like a good wing- tip.
huey,What time is it?

gene,For what?
eleanor grant,For not believing you.
gene,"Believe me, I don't blame you.  This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello."
eleanor grant,"You have a very brave father, Lynn."
lynn,He's a hero.
eleanor grant,"Yes, yes he is."
lynn,Dads are like that.
gene,Can we go now?
eleanor grant,Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
gene,"No, that's... That's OK. We don't need any help. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Lynn?"
eleanor grant,Good luck.
gene,Same to you.
gene,Thanks for the shine.
huey,Thanks for the tip.
gene," Come on, kid. I gotta make a phone call."
huey,Kisses to you.
lynn,"No, kisses to you!"
huey,"No, kisses to you."
