Speaker,Dialogue
mia,"...and I swear to God, she was wrecked. It was pure insanity."
mia,"Don't worry, it is. I know sometimes it --"
woman,"Cappuccino, please."
manager,On us.
woman,"No, I insist."
mia,Shit.
manager,Where do you think you're going?
mia,It's -- five past...
manager,You'd better be here early tomorrow.
mia,Ok.
casting director,One second.
tracy,Holy Mother of God.
mia,I wanted to give you an entrance.
alexis, Mia! How'd it go?
mia,Eh...
alexis,Same here. Was Jen there? Or Rachel?
mia,I don't know who Jen and Rachel are.
alexis,They're the worst.
mia,I don't know if they were there.
alexis,I bet they were.
caitlin, Why is there a convention in the bathroom?
tracy,"Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming, right?"
mia,Can't. Working.
mia, Yes?
tracy,"Look, I know things didn't go well today. There are four things in my inbox that you're perfect for and I will submit you. But right now -- you're coming."
mia,It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed into one of those glass houses.
tracy,Exactly. Fun.
alexis,"Come on, Mia. When else do you get to see every Hollywood clich crammed into a single home?"
tracy, Lex! I'm disappointed in you. There's nothing to make fun of. This party will be humanity at its finest.
sebastian,You gotta stop breaking into my home.
laura,You think Mom or Dad would call this a home?
sebastian,Please don't sit on that.
laura,Are you serious?
sebastian,Yes. Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool. The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away.
laura,I wonder why.  I brought you this. It's a throw rug.
sebastian,Don't need it.
laura,Yeah? What if I told you Miles Davis pissed on it?
sebastian,That's almost insulting...  Did he?
laura,When are you going to unpack these boxes?
sebastian,When I unpack them in my club.
laura,"Oh my God. It's like a girl broke up with you and you're stalking her.  You're not still going by there, are you?"
sebastian,No.
laura,Seb --
sebastian,Who wants to tapas while they samba?
laura,I have someone I want you to meet.
sebastian,I don't want to meet anyone.
laura,You'll like her.
sebastian,Uh-huh. Does she like jazz?
laura,Probably not.
sebastian,Then what are we gonna talk about?
laura,You'll talk about the weather.
sebastian,"Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to meet. He's got a face tattoo, but a heart of gold."
laura,Sebastian --
sebastian,How long's it been?
laura,You need to get serious. You live like a hermit. You're driving without insurance.
sebastian,I am serious. I had a very serious plan for my future. It's not my fault I got Shanghai'ed.
laura,"You did not get ""Shanghai'ed"", you got ripped off."
sebastian,What's the difference?
laura,It's not as romantic as that.  And everyone knew that guy was shady except for you.
sebastian,Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty word?
laura,Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her.
sebastian,"You're acting like life's got me on the ropes -- what you don't understand is, I want to be on the ropes. I'm letting life hit me `til it gets tired. Then I'm gonna make my move. It's a classic rope-a-dope."
laura,I love you. Unpack your boxes.
sebastian,I'm changing the locks.
laura, You can't afford it.
sebastian,I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes!
boss,Seb.
sebastian, Bill. Thanks for having me back.
boss,Your welcome. Stick to the set list.
sebastian,Of course.  Though I don't think they care what I play.
boss,"I do, and I don't want to hear the free jazz."
sebastian,"How `bout one for you, one for me? Or two for you, one for me?  Or all for you, none for me? Ok, that works. Good deal."
waitress,Well... Welcome back.
sebastian,There's a nice way to say that.
boss,...every goddamned night.
sebastian,"I'll stick to the set list, I promise --"
boss,Too late. You're done.
sebastian,You're not gonna find a better player. You know that.
boss, Do you think anyone here gives a shit?
mia,"I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I --"
mia,"No, Jamal. You be trippin'."
tracy,"There you are! You need to meet someone! Carlo, this is Mia. Mia, Carlo's a writer."
carlo, They say I have a knack for world-building.
mia, Congratulations. I have to grab a drink...
singer,"Alright, one more for y'all before we break. Do I hear any requests?"
mia,"""I Ran""."
singer,"""I Ran"" it is.  Wanna start us off, piano-man?"
sebastian,Ok. I remember you.
mia,"""Curt""?"
sebastian,Ok I was an asshole. I can admit that.
mia,Ok.
sebastian,"But requesting ""I Ran"" from a serious musician -- it's too far."
mia,"My God. Did you just call yourself ""a serious musician""?"
sebastian, I don't think so.
mia,Can I borrow what you're wearing?
sebastian,Why?
mia,Because I have an audition next week. I'm playing a serious fire-fighter.
sebastian, So you're an actress. That makes sense. Have I seen you in anything?
mia,Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner Brothers lot. That's a classic.
sebastian,"Oh, you're a barista. Well now I see how you can look down on me from all the way up there."
singer, Sebastian. Second set.
sebastian,He doesn't tell me what to do.
mia,He just told you what to do.
sebastian,I let him.
mia,Mia.
sebastian,Mia. Guess I'll see you in the movies.
singer,Never seen you lookin' so lovely as you did tonight...
carlo,...Goldilocks from the point of view of the bears. Home-invasion thriller. Fox and Warners are going crazy for it.
mia, George Michael!
sebastian,You again.
mia,Did you just get your keys?
sebastian,...Yeah.
mia,Can you grab mine?
sebastian,...Which one is it?
mia,The Prius.
sebastian,Those look comfortable.
mia,They are...n't.
sebastian,You didn't give me much of a choice.
mia,Strange that we keep running into each other.
sebastian,It is strange. Maybe it means something.
mia,I doubt it.
sebastian,Yeah I don't think so either.
mia,What?
sebastian,"It turns your head into an antenna. Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly."
mia,Uh-huh.
sebastian,"You don't live as long, but you get things done faster, so it all evens out."
mia,Oh my God.
sebastian,Not much to look at.
mia,Agreed. I've seen better.
sebastian,"No, that's fine... Thanks..."
mia,...Ok...
customer,Are these pastries gluten-free?
mia,No...
customer,What?? I want a refund.
manager,You're closing up Friday.
mia,I have an audition. Remember?
manager,Do I look like I care? Reschedule it.
mia,But you said --
manager,And fix your apron.
mia,...Hi.  What are you doing here?
sebastian,Meetings. Studio heads.
mia,Uh-huh. How'd you get on the lot?
sebastian,Piece of cake.
mia,I'm off in ten.
sebastian,Great. I'll hide in the bathroom.
mia,That's the window Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart looked out of in Casablanca.
sebastian,What's your Bogart's name...?  Is it Greg?
mia,Yeah. Greg.
sebastian,How long have...?
mia,We've been seeing each other for a few months.
sebastian,I know what you mean. I get breakfast five miles out of the way just to sit outside a jazz club.
mia,Oh yeah?
sebastian,It was called Van Beek. The swing bands played there. Count Basie. Chick Webb.  It's a samba-tapas place now.
mia,A what?
sebastian,Samba-tapas. It's... Exactly. The joke's on history.
mia, We need to wait here.
sebastian,"I know. They shoot movies on my street. ""C-stands."" ""Apple box."" ""Don't forget to sign out."""
sebastian,How'd you get into all this?
mia,"Into...? Oh -- I -- my aunt was an actress. She was in this traveling theater company... And there was this little library across the street from my house when I was growing up. This was Boulder City, Nevada -- every house looked exactly the same. I was ten and already I needed to get out. And one day, my aunt flew into town, and she showed me the library's old-movie section. We spent a whole day watching one after the other. Bringing Up Baby. Notorious. Casablanca.  I never knew the world was so big."
mia,"I started putting on plays in my garage. I'd write the scripts and print up programs, and she'd give me props to use from wherever she'd just been -- New York, London, Paris. And then she'd jet off again and I wouldn't hear from her for another year."
sebastian,Who would you invite to watch? Your parents?
mia,God no -- I didn't invite anyone. That would have been terrifying.
sebastian,...`Cause the world needs more lawyers.
mia,Well it doesn't need more actresses.
sebastian,You're not just an actress.
mia,"What do you mean, ""just an actress""?"
sebastian,"You said it yourself, you're a child- prodigy playwright."
mia,That is not what I said.
sebastian,You're too modest to say it but it's true. So you could write your own roles. Write something that's as interesting as you are.
mia,Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine for an open-mic night. It was horrible.
sebastian,All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong could have played the marching-band charts he was given. What did he do instead? He made history.
mia,"Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make history instead."
sebastian,Yeah?
mia,I hate jazz.
sebastian,"What does that mean? ""I hate jazz""?"
mia,It means when I listen to it I don't like it.
sebastian,"But it's such a blanket statement. It's like saying ""I hate animals""."
mia,I do hate some animals.
sebastian,Do you need to be anywhere right now?
mia,I thought it was just Kenny G.
sebastian,...What?
mia,I associate it with facials. It's relaxing.
sebastian,It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a gunfight `cause somebody told him he played a wrong note!
mia," Right, but it's good to talk over. Where I grew up there's this jazz station they'd play at cocktail parties whenever they served the salami and cheese."
sebastian,Mia. These are things you can't unsay.
mia,Your club?
sebastian,...It's gonna be the old Van Beek. I'm getting the lease back. It'll be perfect.
mia,"Hi, I just missed a call..."
sebastian,Really? For what?
mia,That show I told you about.
sebastian,Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.?
mia,Right. It's -- actually more like Rebel Without a Cause.
sebastian,"That's amazing! ""I got the bulletsssss!"""
mia,Obviously.  No.
sebastian,What? You're the movie person.
mia,It's the one I lie about.
sebastian,Come on. You can't do this audition and never see Rebel. The theater near me's playing it. If you want -- I can take you. For research.
mia, ...Ok.
sebastian,10pm Monday at the Rialto. Cool?
mia,Ok.  For research.
mia,"Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot."
mia,Well -- it's not picked up yet.
mia,"First they make the pilot, then if they like the pilot it goes on TV."
mia,"Well, no, I have a call-back."
mia,It's another audition.
mia,...Well when you put it like that it sounds like a huge accomplishment.
mia,Oxygen.
mia,"You know what, I have to go. I love you."
assistant,Mia Dolan?
director,Whenever you're ready.
mia,"Two options. Follow my rules, or follow my rules. Kapish? You want to bully, you'd best be ready to get bullied --"
director,Thanks.
mia,I can do it another way --
director,"No, thanks, that was great."
alexis,Mia?
greg,"Hey... I'm parked out front. But we should hurry, my brother just landed."
mia,Shit. No. Yes. I'll change...
greg, It's ok.
josh,"That's right -- but now we've got a surround-sound set-up, so it's like --"
fiancee,It's like being in a movie theater.
josh,"It's better than going to a theater, really. You know theaters these days --"
greg,"Oh, sure --"
josh,"-- they're so dirty, and they're either too hot or too cold, and there's always people talking, which is just --  Hello?..."
fiancee,Probably work.
josh,"Yeah, I'll have to call you back.  So, yeah, we love it."
greg,I've never heard anyone say that. Was it amazing?
josh,Oh my God. A five-star jungle eco-resort. It was unbelievable.
greg,Mia?
mia,I'm sorry.
mia,It's a play. I'm going to put it on myself.
mia,Actually -- it's a -- it's a one-woman show...
tracy,...Is that gonna happen every time?
mia, I think so.
sebastian,Keith?
keith,"Holy shit. Come here, man."
sebastian,"This is Mia. Mia, Keith.  We used to play together."
keith,So how've you been?
sebastian,Great. You?
keith,Keeping busy. Got a new combo.
sebastian,Good for you.
keith,...Looking for keys.
sebastian, I'm good.
keith,You sure? It pays.
sebastian,I'm good.
keith,Let's just grab a drink then. Call me. It's been too long.
sebastian,You bet.
keith,"Nice meeting you, Mia."
mia,Nice meeting you.
sebastian,It's beautiful.
mia,...You're just saying that.
sebastian,No... I'm not.
mia,I don't know... Is the whole thing too nostalgic?
sebastian,That's the point.
mia,But do you think people will like it?
sebastian,Fuck `em.
mia, You always say that.
sebastian,I truly believe it.
mia,Fine -- as long as you sit front-row `cause I'll probably throw up on the middle of the stage otherwise.
sebastian,I'll be front-row.
mia,I made something for you.
sebastian,What's that?
mia,It could be the name design. On the door.
sebastian,"Why does it say ""Seb's""?"
mia,That's what you should name it.
sebastian,Never.
mia,"Sebastian, no one's going to a club called ""Chicken on a Stick""."
sebastian,"You don't get it. Charlie Parker got the name ""Bird"" because he loved chicken. So my club's gonna be old-school jazz and beer and chicken. ""Chicken on a Stick""."
mia,No. Drop the chicken. Drinks and jazz.  And it's time to start looking for other places.
sebastian,It's gotta be Van Beek. I can't let them samba all over its history.
mia,Make your own history.
sebastian,Your play's incredible.
mia,I'm doing that.
sebastian,...Which guy?
mia,The one who offered you a gig.
sebastian,You mean Keith? He's the worst.
mia,Why was it weird between you two?
sebastian,It's always weird with him.
mia,He did offer you a job.
sebastian,Right...
mia,Are you going to call him?
sebastian,No.
mia,Ok...
sebastian,Here's what we know. It's definitely Chicken on a Stick --  -- and your play is going to be a triumph.
keith,Sebastian.
sebastian, Well... Here I am.
keith,"Here's the deal. We've got distribution with Universal, got our own imprint. We're about to go on the road. We can cut you in for 1K a week while we tour, plus an equal share of any merchandise or ticket revenue that comes in. Sound good?"
sebastian,"Yeah, that...that...  ...sounds good."
keith,"Let's play, see how it feels."
sebastian,You're holding onto the past. But jazz is about the future.
keith,"I get it. I got it wrong. Last guy wasn't as good as you. But you're a pain in the ass, man."
laura,Look at him -- watch --
harry,"Hey. I'm grabbing some pastries, you two want anything?"
mia,"Thanks Harry, I'm good."
laura,Same here but I think someone's trying to break into your car.
mia,I think today's San Diego. I'm not sure...
laura,"You should come over tonight. Harry's cooking, but don't let that stop you.  What's the matter?"
mia,Nothing...
laura,You miss him.
mia,I guess. I'm adapting.
laura, I got used to being alone. Growing up it was just me and Seb. We only had each other.
mia,He told me.
laura,I wasn't looking for anybody. Then I met Harry and -- we just fit...  You've changed Seb. You know that?
mia,Do you think he's happy?
laura,Is he happy?
mia,"I mean with the band, the travel, all of it."
laura,"Our dad never got to do what he wanted. We were always treading water, he took a job running a washer-dryer store. But every night at home he'd play his clarinet along to a Benny Goodman record.  So I look at Sebastian... Playing music, getting paid for it. I'm happy for him."
harry,"Oh, right -- I'll eat it I guess."
laura,No -- I changed my mind.
mia,Hey it's me... Not sure where you are -- maybe Boston? Or Dallas? Anyway... I haven't heard from you in a while... I miss you...  Ok... Bye...
sebastian,Surprise.
mia,Stay.
sebastian,How's the play going?
mia,I'm nervous.
sebastian,Why?
mia,Because...  What if people show up?
sebastian,Fuck `em!
mia,I'm nervous to be up on a stage and perform in front of people. I'm terrified.
sebastian,They should be so lucky to see it.  It's going to be incredible. I can't wait.
mia,I can.
mia,Ugh.
sebastian,Yep. Boise.
mia,Boise?
sebastian, You should come.
mia,To Boise?
sebastian,"Yeah, you could knock that off your bucket list."
mia,Wish I could.
sebastian,Why can't you?
mia,Come to Boise?
sebastian,Yeah.
mia,Because I have to rehearse.
sebastian,Can't you rehearse anywhere?
mia,You mean anywhere you are?
sebastian,...I -- I guess...
mia,"Well, all my stuff is here and my show's in a few weeks and -- I don't know, it doesn't seem practical..."
sebastian,Right... I just -- we're going to have to do things so we can see each other. We never see each other.
mia,"I know, but when are you done?"
sebastian,...What do you mean?
mia,When are you done with the tour?
sebastian,"But -- as soon as we're done with the tour we go back and record, and then we go back on tour."
mia,So it's...the long haul?
sebastian,...What does that mean?
mia,"I mean the long haul -- like, you're going to be in this band for a long time."
sebastian,What did you think I was going to do?
mia,"I don't know, I didn't think the band would --"
sebastian,You didn't think we'd be successful.
mia,"No, that's not what I meant. What I meant was -- this band -- you're going to be on the road for -- what, years now?"
sebastian,"Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road for years with just this record."
mia,Do you like the music you're playing?
sebastian,I don't know how that matters.
mia,It matters if you're going to give up your dream to be on the road for years.
sebastian,Do you like the music I'm playing?
mia,Yes. I do.  I just didn't think you did.
sebastian,"Yeah, well, I --"
mia,"And now I hear you're going to be on the road for years, and I'm --"
sebastian,What are you doing? Why are you doing this?
mia,What do you mean why am I doing this?
sebastian,This is what you wanted from me.
mia,To be in this band?
sebastian,To have a steady job.
mia,"Yes, I wanted you to have a job so you could take care of yourself and start your club."
sebastian,So I'm doing that. So why aren't we celebrating?
mia,Why aren't you starting your club?
sebastian,You said yourself no one wants to go to that club! No one wants to go to a club called Chicken on a Stick --
mia,Change the name!
sebastian,-- and no one likes jazz. Not even you.
mia,"I do like jazz now, because of you."
sebastian," What am I supposed to do? Go back to playing ""Jingle Bells"" so I can save money for some Shangri-La club no one wants to go to?"
mia,People will want to go to it! People love what other people are passionate about.
sebastian,Not in my experience.
mia," You had a dream that you were sticking to, that --"
sebastian,This is the dream!
mia,This is not your dream.
sebastian,Guys like me go their whole lives and never do anything that's liked. I'm finally doing something that people enjoy. What is wrong with that?
mia,Why do you care so much about being liked -- ?
sebastian," You're an actress, who are you to talk??"
mia,Are you kidding?
sebastian,No.
keith,"You good for tonight, right?"
sebastian,...Tonight?
keith,Seven. The photo shoot.  Mojo.
sebastian,I thought that was next Thursday.
keith,No. It's tonight.
photographer,Put a light on the drums... I need more fill in this corner...
sebastian,Mia!
mia,Stop --
sebastian,I'm -- I'm sorry I missed it -- and I'm sorry I was a dick and I -- I promise I'll make it up to you --
mia,It's over.
sebastian, ...What do you mean?
mia,I'm done embarrassing myself.
sebastian,You didn't embarrass yourself...
mia,No one showed up. I can't even pay back the theater.
sebastian,...This is home.
mia,Not anymore.
laura,You remember the McKenzies?
sebastian,"Oh God, I didn't see them."
laura,"Yeah. They kept going, ""oh Sebastian's so handsome""."
sebastian,You look beautiful.  I hope it was ok. I haven't played in a while.
laura,You were great  You're always great when you play.
sebastian,Yes ma'am.
laura,I'm not gonna be hovering anymore.
sebastian,...You still think New York?
laura,"I think so. Maybe Boston. I don't know, it's exciting..."
sebastian,What...?
sebastian,Wrong number.
sebastian,"Yeah, well...not anymore."
sebastian,I won't.
sebastian,"""Casting""...?"
mia's dad,You want some more rice?
mia,I'm ok.
mia's dad,You look hungry.
mia,I'm good...
mia's dad,It's fun having you back. Your mom ditches me at ten.
mia,You took down the swing.
mia's dad,She made me.
mia,Oh God. Throw those away.
mia's dad,Never.
mia,Why did you come here?
sebastian,Because I have good news.
mia,Ok...
sebastian,Amy Brandt. The casting director.
mia,I know who she is.
sebastian,She was at your play. And she loved it. And she loved it so much that she wants you to come audition for a huge movie she's got.
mia,I'm not going.
sebastian,...Excuse me?
mia,I'm -- no... That will kill me.
sebastian,That's it?
mia,Yes.
sebastian,So you're happy here?
mia,I'm happier.
sebastian,Why won't you come?
mia,I told you.
sebastian,I don't buy it.
mia, -- because --
sebastian,Because what?
mia,Because I'm probably not good enough.
sebastian,Yes you are.
mia,No. Maybe I'm not.
sebastian,Why?
mia,Why what?
sebastian,Why don't you want to do it anymore?
mia,...Because it hurts a little bit too much.
sebastian,I told them you'd be there at five-thirty tomorrow. I'll swing by here before I drive back at eight. Either you'll be outside or you won't.
mia,How did you find me?
sebastian,The house across from the library.
amy brandt,"I'm Amy, this is Frank. Glad we found you."
frank,"We want to build the character with you. It's a process. Three-month rehearsal, four-month shoot."
mia,...Ok.
amy brandt,So why don't you just tell us a story?
mia,...About...?
amy brandt,About anything.
mia,"My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... She used to tell me these stories, when I was growing up, about living abroad...  I remember -- she told me she jumped into the Seine once..."
sebastian,When do you find out?
mia,They said the next couple of days... But I'm not expecting to find anything out.
sebastian,You're going to get it.
mia,"No, I'm not."
sebastian,You are. I know these things.
mia,Where are we?
sebastian,Griffith Park.
mia,I mean -- where are we?
sebastian,I know...  I don't know.
mia,What do we do?
sebastian,I don't think we can do anything. Because when you get this --
mia,If I get this --
sebastian,When you get this -- you've got to give it everything you've got.
mia,What are you going to do?
sebastian,I've got to follow my own plan. Stay here. Get my own thing going. You know...
mia,Right.
sebastian,I guess we're just going to have to wait and see.
mia,You know I'm always going to love you.
sebastian,I'm always going to love you too.
mia, I've seen better.
sebastian,Agreed.
mia,I've never been here during the day.
mia,"Hi... Iced coffee, please."
new manager,On us.
mia,"No, no, that's fine."
sebastian,"Alright, I'm done.  Harris did a nice job with it."
employee,Took him long enough.
sebastian,No one touches the instruments. Carson's coming an hour early to test levels.
employee,I got a check for you to sign.
sebastian,How'd we do last month?
employee,Not too bad.
sebastian, See you tonight.
employee,See you tonight.
drummer,King Seb!
sebastian,Hothouse Eddie -- miss me?
drummer,Like the desert misses the rain.
saxophonist,Seb -- Edgar's bringing his horn tonight.
sebastian,"Yeah? Tell him to tune it, huh?"
saxophonist,That's not Edgar.
mia,"Bye, sweetie. You be nice to Chelsea."
chelsea,"Bye, Mrs. Dolan."
david,What if we miss this? What do we tell Natalie?
mia,We can just see it back in New York...
david,Alright...
sebastian," I don't know, I told him to play ""Jingle Bells""."
mia,"I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I --"
david,Do you want to stay for another?
mia,No... We should go.
