In this temple Buddha still stands , some stray unknown forest people still coming to worship here,       There are fresh joss sticks burn- ing.   Several   mercenaries, mostly black in their early twenties r are inside the temple, sprawled on the floor on their ponchos, a small fire going.         One is sleeping, another reheating a piece of meat; they have killed a wild deer and his half-eaten corpse is still slowly roasting on a stick built over the fire.

42,"Though th@ outfit has been several weeks in the Forest, the blacks have no beards.     A small transistor.radio   plays inside the Temple and two of the Brothers are dancing softly to the sound of soul music. The white world is for the most part outside the Temple, sprawled about it in the thick grass, relaxing. Some have beards, others have shaved, but their faces are hard and dirty, dust and dirt is deeply ingrained in the cracks of skin,    Anthony is an exception, he has kept him- self clean, his beard barely visible, although there are small lines of fatigue under his eyes and a small scar under his left eye, the result of a previous wound, not serious.    He tends to rub it occasionally.    Ironically,    in the war, he has become even softer. Time has crumbled: he is spacing himself. The contrast is made then, by camera CloseuPs, of the black and white features,     The Blacks are tenderer, softer.     The Whites are tired, cruel.   The blacks Sing- Dance.     Although inside they are as blue as the sky, and scared."

From a distance, inside the temple, on the radio, Sam Cooke's song ""Cupid"" is playing loud, and sort of sad like all Cooke's songs , giving a texture of music and sunlight to his walk."
