Speaker,Dialogue
interviewer, That's fine.
interviewer, That's fine.
interviewer," So, Mr. Incredible...do you have a secret identity?"
elastigirl," Of course I have a secret identity. Can you see me in this at the supermarket? Come on. Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl, y'know what I mean?"
frozone," Superladies, they're always trying to tell you their secret identity. Think it'll strengthen the relationship or something like that. I said, ''Girl, I don't want to know about your mild-mannered alter ego.'' or anything like that. I mean, you tell me you're a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe, that's all right with me. I'm good. I'm good."
interviewer, I could get to that point.
interviewer," Wait, no, don't get up. We're not finished."
elastigirl," Settle down? Are you kidding? I'm at the top of my game! I'm right up there with the big dogs! Girls, come on. Leave the saving of the world to the men? I don't think so. I don't think so."
police radio," We interrupt for an important bulletin. A deadly high-speed pursuit between police and armed gunmen is underway, traveling northbound on San Pablo Ave."
old lady," Mr. lncredible. Um, Mr. Incredible..."
old lady," My cat, Squeaker, won't come down."
old lady," No, no. He's quite tame."
police radio, Attention all units. We have a tour bus robbery...
thief," Hey, look--"
thief," Hey, look, the lady got me first."
woman, He's gonna jump!
sansweet, I think you broke something.
voyage, [French] Mr. Incredible!
voyage, lncrediBoy?
voyage, [French] Little oaf.
voyage, [French] And your outfit is totally ridiculous!
police officer, They've already picked him up.
police officer, You mean he got away?
police officer, What about Bomb Voyage?
priest," Robert Parr, will you have this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?"
priest, ...so long as you both shall live?
priest, I pronounce this couple husband and wife.
announcer," In a stunning turn of events, a superhero is being sued for saving someone who, apparently, didn't want to be saved. The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet, who was foiled in his attempted suicide by Mr. Incredible, has filed suit against the famed superhero in Superior Court."
sansweet's lawyer," Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved. Mr. Sansweet didn't want to be saved. And the injury received from Mr. Incredible ''actions'', so quote, causes him daily pain."
sansweet," You didn't save my life! You ruined my death, that's what you did!"
announcer," Five days later, another suit was filed by victims of the el train accident. Incredible's court losses cost the government millions. And opened the flood gates for dozens of superhero lawsuits the world over."
woman," It is time for their secret identity to become their only identity. Time for them to join us, or go away."
announcer," Under tremendous public pressure, and the crushing financial burden of an ever mounting series of lawsuits, the government quietly initiated the superhero relocation program. The supers will be granted amnesty from responsibility for past actions, in exchange for the promise to never again resume hero work. Where are they now? They are living among us. Average citizens, average heroes. Quietly and anonymously continuing to make the world a better place."
bob," I'm sorry, Mrs. Hogenson, but our liability is spelled out"
bob," [phone rings] Excuse me. [answers phone] Claims, Bob Parr."
helen, I'm calling to celebrate a momentous occasion. We're now officially moved in.
bob," Yeah, well, that's great, honey. In the last three years don't count because..."
helen," Because I finally unpacked the last box. Now, it's official. Ha, ha, ha. Why do we have so much junk?"
bob," Listen, honey, I've got a client."
helen," Say no more. Go save the world one policy at a time, honey. Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids from school. See you tonight."
bob," Bye, honey. Excuse me. Where were we?"
bob," All right, listen closely. I'd like to help you, but I can't. I'd like to tell you to take a copy of your policy to Norma Wilcox on...[whispering] Norma Wilcox. W-l-L-C-O-X. On the third floor. But I can't. I also do not advise you to fill out and file a WS2475 form with our legal department on the second floor. I wouldn't expect someone to get back to you quickly to resolve the matter. I'd like to help, but there's nothing I can do."
bob," Shhh! [shouting] I'm sorry, ma'am! I know you're upset! [whispering] Pretend to be upset."
bob," Someone broke into their house, Mr. Huph. Their policy clearly covers--"
principal," I appreciate you coming down here, Mrs. Parr."
helen, What's this about? Has Dash done something wrong?
bernie, He's a disruptive influence and he openly mocks me in front of the class.
dash, He says.
bernie," Look, I know it's you! He puts thumbtacks on my stool."
helen, You saw him do this?
bernie," Well...not really. No. Actually, not."
helen," Oh, then how do you know it was him?"
bernie," I hid a camera. Yeah, and this time, I've got him. See? You see? You don't see it? He moves! Right there! Wait, wait! Right there! Right as I'm sitting down! I don't know how he does it, but there's no tack before he moves and after he moves, there's a tack. Coincidence? I think not!"
principal, Bernie...
bernie, Don't ''Bernie'' me. [screaming] This little rat is guilty!
principal," You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr. I'm sorry for the trouble."
bernie," You're letting him go again? He's guilty! You can see it on his smug little face. Guilty, I say, guilty!"
helen," Dash, this is the third time this year you've been sent to the office. We need to find a better outlet. A more...constructive outlet."
dash," Maybe I could, if you'd let me go out for sports."
helen," Honey, you know why we can't do that."
dash, I promise I'll slow up. I'll only be the best by a tiny bit.
helen," Dashiell Robert Parr, you are an incredibly competitive boy. And a bit of a showoff. The last thing you need is temptation."
dash," You always say, ''Do your best.'' But you don't really mean it. Why can't I do the best that I can do?"
helen," Right now, honey, the world just wants us to fit in, and to fit in, we just gotta be like everybody else."
dash, Dad always said our powers were nothing to be ashamed of. Our powers made us special.
helen," Everyone's special, Dash."
dash, Which is another way of saying no one is.
boy," Hey, Rydinger. Where you headed?"
girl," Hi, Tony."
tony, Hey.
boy," Hey, Tony, can I carry your books?"
tony, That's kind of funny.
boy 1," Hey, Tony, do you play football?"
boy 2," Tony, I thought we were gonna go swimming."
violet, He looked at me.
dash," Come on, Violet!"
bob, [muttering] Darn kids. Sitting on the driveway...
bob," Oh, great."
dash, Mom. You're making weird faces again.
helen," No, I'm not."
bob," You make weird faces, honey."
helen, Do you have to read at the table?
bob, Uh-huh. Yeah.
helen," Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes! Bob, could you help the carnivore cut his meat?"
dash, Ow.
helen," Dash, you have something you wanna tell your father about school?"
dash," [nervously] Well, we dissected a frog."
helen, Dash got sent to the office again.
bob, [distracted] Good. Good.
helen," No, Bob, that's bad."
bob, What?
helen, Dash got sent to the office again.
bob, What?! What for?
dash, Nothing.
helen, He put a tack on the teacher's chair...during class.
dash, Nobody saw me. You could barely see it on the tape.
bob, They caught you on tape and you still got away with it? Whoa! You must have been booking. How fast did you think were you going?
helen, Bob! We are not encouraging this.
bob," I'm not encouraging, I'm just asking how fast..."
helen, Honey!
bob," Great. First the car, now I gotta pay to fix the table..."
helen, The car? What happened to the car?
bob, Here. I'm getting a new plate.
helen," So, how about you, Vi? How was school?"
violet, Nothing to report.
helen, You've hardly touched your food.
violet, I'm not hungry for meatloaf.
helen," Well, it is leftover night. We have steak, pasta. What are you hungry for?"
dash, Tony Rydinger.
violet, Shut up!
dash," Well, you are."
violet," I said, shut up, you little insect!"
dash," Well, she is."
helen, Do not shout at the table. Honey!
bob, Kids! Listen to your mother.
dash, She'd eat if we were having Tony loaf.
violet, That's it!
helen, Stop it!
dash, You're gonna be toast!
helen, Stop running in the house. Sit down!
dash," Ow! Hey, no force fields!"
violet, You started it.
helen, You sit down! You sit down! Violet!
bob," ''Simon J. Paladino, longtime advocate of superhero rights, is missing''? Gazerbeam."
helen, Bob! It's time to engage. Do something! Don't just stand there! I need you to intervene!
bob, You want me to intervene? Okay. I'm intervening. I'm intervening!
helen," Violet, let go of your brother!"
bob, Get the door.
dash," Hey, Lucius!"
lucius," Hey, Speedo. Hey, Helen. Vi, Jack-Jack."
bob, He-hey! Ice of you to drop by.
lucius, Ha! Never heard that one before.
dash, [gargling] Lucius!
lucius, Whoa!
lucius," Ha, ha."
dash, Oh! I like it when it shatters.
bob, I'll be back later.
helen," Hey, where are you two going?"
bob, It's Wednesday.
helen," Oh. Bowling night. Say hello to Honey for me, Lucius."
lucius," Will do. Good night, Helen. Good night, kids."
helen," Don't think you've avoided talking about your trip to the principal's office, young man. Your father and I are still gonna discuss it."
dash," I'm not the only kid who's been sent to the office, you know."
helen," Other kids don't have superpowers. Now, it's perfectly normal..."
violet, Normal? What do you know about normal? What does anyone in this family know about normal?
helen," Now, wait a minute, young lady."
violet," We act normal, mom. I wanna be normal! The only normal one is Jack-Jack, and he's not even toilet trained."
dash, Lucky. I meant about being normal.
lucius," So now I'm in deep trouble. I mean, one more jolt of this death ray and I'm an epitaph. Somehow I managed to find cover and what does Baron Von Ruthless do?"
bob, He starts monologuing.
lucius," He starts monologuing! He starts like this prepared speech about how feeble I am compared to him. How inevitable my defeat is, how the world will soon be his! Yada, yada, yada."
bob, Yammering.
lucius," Yammering! I mean, the guy has me on a platter, and he won't shut up."
bob," 23-56, what is that? Robbery?"
lucius, This is just sad.
bob," Yeah, robbery. Want to catch a robber?"
lucius," No. Tell you the truth, I'd rather go bowling. Look, what if we actually did what our wives think we're doing? Just to shake things up."
woman, He's not alone. The fat guy's still with him. They're just talking.
lucius," What are we doing here, Bob?"
bob, Protecting people.
lucius, Nobody asked us.
bob, You need an invitation?
lucius," I'd like one, yes. We keep sneaking out to do this, and...you remember Gazerbeam?"
bob, Yeah. There was something about him in the paper.
lucius," He had trouble adjusting to civilian life, too."
bob, When's the last time you saw him?
lucius," I don't see anyone from the old days, Bob. Just you. And we're pushing our luck as it is."
bob," Oh, come on."
lucius," It was fun the first time, but if we keep doing this, we're gonna get--"
police radio, We have a report on a fire...
bob," A fire. We're close! [yelling] Yeah, baby!"
lucius, We're gonna get caught.
bob, Woohoo! Haha! Fire! Yeah!
lucius, Is that everybody?
bob," Yeah, that's everyone."
lucius, It better be.
bob, Can't you put this out?
lucius, I can't lay down a layer thick enough! It's evaporating too fast!
bob," Well, what's that mean?"
lucius," It means it's hot! And I'm dehydrated, Bob!"
bob, You're out of ice? You can't run out of ice! I thought you can use water in the air!
lucius," There is no water in this air! What's your excuse, run out of muscle?"
bob, I just can't go smashing into walls! The building's getting weaker by the second! It's gonna come down on top of us!
lucius, I wanted to go bowling!
bob, All right! Stay right on my tail! This is gonna get hot!
bob, Yeah.
bob, [realizes they're in a jewelry store...] Uh-oh.
bob," [...and unknowingly trips the alarm] Oh, good."
lucius," Oh, now...that ain't right!"
police officer, Freeze!
police officer, Freeze!
lucius, I'm thirsty.
police officer, I said freeze!
lucius, I'm just getting a drink.
police officer, Alright. You've had your drink. Now I want you to...
lucius, I know. I know. Freeze.
police radio, Shots fired!
officers, Police officers!
lucius, That was way too close. We are not doing that again.
man, [over radio] Verify you want to switch targets? Over.
woman, Trust me. This is the one he's been looking for.
helen, I thought you'd be back by 11 .
bob, I said I'd be back later.
helen, I assumed you'd be back later. lf you came back at all...you'd be ''back later''.
bob," Well, I'm back, okay?"
helen, Is this rubble?
bob, [with mouth full] It was just a little workout. Just to stay loose.
helen," You know how I feel about that, Bob. Darn you! We can't blow cover again!"
bob, The building was coming down anyway.
helen, What?! You knocked down a building?!
bob, It was on fire. Structurally unsound. It was coming down anyway.
helen, Tell me you haven't been listening to the police scanner again?
bob," Look, I performed a public service. You act like that's a bad thing."
helen," It is a bad thing, Bob! Uprooting our family again, so you can relive the glory days is a very bad thing."
bob, Reliving the glory days is better than acting like they didn't happen!
helen," Yes! They happened! But this, our family, is what's happening now, Bob. And you are missing this! I can't believe you don't want to go to your own son's graduation."
bob, It's not a graduation. He's moving from the fourth grade to the fifth grade.
helen, It's a ceremony!
bob, It's psychotic! They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity but if someone is genuinely exceptional...
helen," This is not about you, Bob. This is about Dash."
bob, You want to do something for Dash? Then let him actually compete. Let him go out for sports!
helen, I will not be made the enemy here! You know why we can't do that.
bob, Because he'd be great!
helen, This is not about you!
bob," All right, Dash. I know you're listening. Come on out."
helen," Vi? You, too, young lady."
bob," Come on. Come on out. It's okay, kids. We're just having a discussion."
violet, Pretty loud discussion.
bob," Yeah. But that's okay. Because what's important is that Mommy and I are always a team. We're always united against, uh, the forces of, uh..."
helen, Pigheadedness?
bob, I was gonna say evil or something.
helen, We're sorry we woke you. Everything's okay. Go back to bed. It's late.
dash," Good night, Mom. Night, Dad."
violet, Good night.
helen," In fact, we should all be in bed."
bob, Now?
bob, Okay. Why?
bob, Why are you unhappy?
bob," What, you've gotten complaints?"
bob, Did I do something illegal?
bob, Are you saying we shouldn't help our customers?
bob, We're supposed to help people.
bob, Is like an enormous clock.
bob," That man out there, he needs help."
bob, He is getting mugged!
bob, I'll be right back.
bob, He got away.
bob, Uh-oh.
bob, How is he?
rick, He'll live.
bob," I'm fired, aren't I?"
rick," Oh, you think?"
bob," What can I say, Rick?"
rick, Nothing you haven't said before.
bob, Someone was in trouble.
rick, Someone's always in trouble.
bob, I had to do something.
rick," Yeah. Every time you say those words, it means a month and a half of trouble for me, Bob. It means hundreds of thousands of taxpayer's dollars."
bob, I know.
rick," We gotta pay to keep the company quiet. We gotta pay damages, erase memories, relocate your family. Every time it gets harder. Money, money, money, money. We can't keep doing this, Bob! We appreciate what you did in the old days, but those days are over. From now on, you're on your own."
rick," Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate you, you know, for old times' sake."
bob," No, I can't do that to my family. Everyone just got settled. I'll make it work. Thanks."
rick, Take care of yourself.
bob," Well, what are you waiting for?"
kid," I don't know. Something amazing, I guess."
bob," [sighs] Me too, kid."
bob, Huh? ''Hold still''?
computer, Match: Mr. Incredible. Room is secure. Commence message.
mirage," Hello, Mr. Incredible. Yes, we know who you are. Rest assured, your secret is safe with us. My name is Mirage. We have something in common. According to the government, neither of us exist. Please pay attention, as this message is classified and will not be repeated. I represent a top secret division of the government, designing and testing experimental technology, and we have need of your unique abilities. Something has happened at our testing facility."
helen, Honey!
bob, Huh? What?
helen, Dinner's ready.
bob, Okay.
mirage," ...it is contained within an isolated area, it threatens to cause incalculable damage to itself and to our facilities, jeopardizing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment..."
helen, Is someone in there?
bob," It's the TV, trying to watch."
mirage, Because of its highly sensitive nature...
helen," Well, stop trying. It's time for dinner."
bob, One minute!
mirage," If you accept, your payment will be triple your current annual salary. Call the number on the card. Voice-matching will be used to ensure security. The supers aren't gone, Mr. Incredible. You're still here. You can still do great things. Or...you can listen to police scanners. Your choice. You have 24 hours to respond. Think about it."
computer, This message will self-destruct.
bob, Uh-oh.
helen, You are one distracted guy.
bob, Hmm? Am I? I don't mean to be.
helen, I know you miss being a hero and your job is frustrating. I just want you to know how much it means to me that you stay at it anyway.
bob, Honey? About the job?
helen, What?
bob, Something's happened.
helen, What?
bob," The, uh..."
helen, What?
bob," The company is sending me to, uh, a conference."
helen, A conference?
bob, [stammering] Out of town. And I'm just gonna be gone for a few days.
helen," They've never sent you to a conference before. This is good, isn't it?"
bob, [hesitating] Yes.
helen, You see? They're finally recognizing your talents. You're moving up.
bob, Yes.
helen, Honey! This is wonderful!
bob," Yes, it is."
mirage," The Omnidroid 9000 is a top secret prototype battle robot. lts artificial intelligence enables it to solve any problem it's confronted with. And, unfortunately..."
mirage," We lost control. And now it's loose in the jungle, threatening our facility. We've had to evacuate all personnel from the island for their own safety."
mirage, The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate an air drop from 5000 feet. lts cloaking devices make it difficult to track. Although we're pretty sure it's on the southern half of the island. One more thing. Obviously it represents a significant investment.
mirage,You are Mr. lncredible.
mirage," I've got to warn you, it's a learning robot. Every moment you spend fighting it only increases its knowledge of how to beat you."
mirage, And don't die.
man," Surprising. We must bring him back. Sound the all clear, and invite him to dinner."
man,"Most important, keep things light. Praise him. Make him feel like we appreciate his abilities."
mirage," Actually, you look rather dashing."
mirage," Oh, I'm sorry. He won't be dining with us. He hopes you'll understand."
mirage," He prefers a certain amount of anonymity. Surely, you of all people understand that."
mirage, With a volcano? He's attracted to power. So am I. It's a weakness we share.
mirage, I prefer to think of it as misunderstood.
mirage, Volcanic soil is among the most fertile on Earth. Everything at the table was grown right here. How does it compare?
bob, Jeez.
helen," Hurry, honey. Or you'll be late for work."
helen," Have a great day, honey."
bob, Thanks.
helen," Help customers, climb ladders..."
bob, Bring bacon?
helen, All that jazz.
guard, You have an appointment?
bob, I'm an old friend. I just wanted to...
guard, All visitors are required to make a reser--
bob, Weren't you just in the news? Some show in Prayge... Prague?
bob," E, I just need a patch job."
bob, Must have happened a long time ago.
bob, What do you mean? You designed it.
bob, A new suit? Where the heck am I gonna get a new suit?
bob, Wait. You want to make me a suit?
bob, Yeah.
bob," Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy! Oh! He had a great look! Oh, the cape and the boots..."
bob, Isn't that my decision?
bob," Listen, E..."
bob, Thunderhead was not the brightest bulb...
bob," E, you can't generalize about these things."
bob, You know I'm retired from hero work.
bob," E, I only need a patch job. For sentimental reasons."
bob," You're the best of the best, E."
bob," I got it, I got it! Don't answer it, honey, I got it!"
bob, Hello?
mirage, We have a new assignment for you. How soon can you get here?
bob, I'll leave tomorrow morning.
mirage, See you there.
bob, Goodbye.
helen," Who was that, honey? The, uh, office?"
bob," Another conference. Short notice, but you know...duty calls. [nervous laugh]"
helen, Bob?
bob," Yeah, what's up, honey?"
helen, Ha... have a great trip.
bob," Thanks, sweetie. I'll call you when I get there."
helen, I love you. So much.
bob, I love you too.

helen, [gasps] Edna.  __________________________________________SCENE 19__________________________________________
helen," I'd like to speak to Edna, please."
helen, E? This is Helen.
helen, Helen Parr? You know...Elastigirl?
helen," Yes, yes, yes. It's been a while. Listen, there's only one person Bob would trust to patch his supersuit and that's you, E."
helen," Look, I'm calling about..."
helen," Beg? Uh, no. I'm calling about suit. Ab-about Bob's suit! I'm calling about Bob's suit!"
syndrome," It's bigger! It's badder! Ladies and gentlemen, it's too much for Mr. lncredible! Whoa! Whoa! It's finally ready. You know, I went through quite a few supers to get it worthy to fight you, but man, it wasn't good enough! After you trashed the last one, I had to make some major modifications. Sure it was difficult, but you are worth it. I mean, after all...I am your biggest fan."
syndrome, My name is not Buddy! And it's not lncrediBoy either! That ship has sailed. All I wanted was to help you. I only wanted to help! And what did you say to me?
syndrome, It tore me apart. But I learned an important lesson. You can't count on anyone. Especially your heroes.
syndrome," See? Now you respect me, because I'm a threat. That's the way it works. Turns out there's a lot of people, whole countries who want respect. And they will pay through the nose to get it. How do you think I got rich? I invented weapons. And now I have a weapon only I can defeat. And when I unleash it, I'll get--"
syndrome," [laughing] You sly dog! You got me monologuing. I can't believe it. It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy. I save the best inventions for myself. Am I good enough now? Who's super now? I'm Syndrome! Your nemesis and..."
syndrome," Oh, brilliant!"
syndrome," All right, try this one on for size, big boy."
probe, Life reading negative. Mr. Incredible terminated.  __________________________________________SCENE 21__________________________________________
helen," E, I just..."
helen," E, It's great to see you, but I gotta tell you I have no idea what you're talking about. I just..."
helen, Thanks.
helen, Started?
helen, What on earth do you think the baby will be doing?!
helen, Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers.
helen, What do I think? Bob is retired! I'm retired! Our family is underground. You helped my husband resume secret hero work behind my back?!
helen, He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.
helen, What are you saying?
helen, Of course.
guard 1," Hey, hey. We got a man down!"
guard 2," Come on, let's go."
guard 2, Are you okay? What happened?
helen," Oh, hello. This is Helen Parr. Bob Parr is my husband. I was wondering if you could give me the number of the hotel he's staying at? The number I have is no good."
woman, Mr. Parr no longer works at Insuricare.
helen, What do you mean? He's on a business trip. A company retreat.
woman, My records say his employment was terminated almost two months ago.
helen," [sobbing] I am such an idiot. I let this happen, you know. The new sports car, the getting in shape, the blond hair, the lies."
helen, Now I'm losing him! What'll I do? What'll I do?
helen, Hmm?
helen," There's lots of leftovers that you can reheat. Make sure Dash does his homework. And both of you, get to bed on time. I should be back tonight. Late. You can be in charge that long, can't you?"
violet, Yeah. But why am I in charge again?
helen, Nothing. Just a little trouble with Daddy.
violet," You mean Dad's in trouble, or Dad is the trouble?"
helen," I mean either he's in trouble, or he's going to be."
dash," Hey! What's that? Where'd you get that, Mom? You made a cool outfit? Hey, are those for us? We all get cool outfits?"
dash, Ha-ha!
helen, Dash! You come back here this moment!
helen," Hey, Snug. Thanks for getting back. I know this is short notice, but I was hoping that I could get you to..."
violet, What are these?
dash," Look, I'm The Dash! The Dash likes."
helen, Just a second. Take that off before somebody sees it.
violet, But you're packing one just like it. Are you hiding something?
helen," Oh, please, honey. I'm on the phone...Dash!"
dash, Yikes! This is yours. It's specially made.
violet, What's going on?
helen, You're not coming! And I've gotta pack!
violet, What makes you think it's special?
dash, I don't know. Why'd Mom try to hide it?
helen," Snug, I'm calling in a solid you owe me."
helen, A jet. What do you got that's fast?
snug, Let me think...  __________________________________________SCENE 24__________________________________________
helen, Island approach. India Golf niner-niner checking in. VFR on top. Over.
helen," Island tower, this is India Golf niner-niner requesting vectors to the initial. Over."
helen," Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl. You're overreacting. Everything's fine. They're just all getting coffee. At the same time. Yeah."
syndrome," You sir, truly are ''Mr. lncredible''! You know, I was right to idolize you. I always knew you were tough, but tricking the probe by hiding under the bones of another super? Oh, man! I'm still geeking out about it! [sighs] And then you had to just go and ruin the ride. I mean, Mr. lncredible calling for help? [mocking] ''Help me, help me.'' Lame, lame, lame, lame, lame! All right, who did you contact?!"
syndrome, I am referring to last night at 2307 hours while you were snooping around. You sent out a homing signal.
syndrome, And now a government plane is requesting permission to land here! Who did you contact?!
syndrome, Play the transmission.
helen, India golf niner-niner checking in. VFR on top. Over.
syndrome," So you do know these people. Well, then, I'll send them a little greeting."
violet, Ow!
violet," It's not my fault! Dash ran away, and I knew I'd get blamed for it--"
dash, That's not true!
kari," You don't have to worry about one single thing, Mrs. Parr. I've got this baby-sitting thing wired. I've taken courses and learned CPR and I got excellent marks and certificates..."
kari, I also brought Mozart to play while he sleeps to make him smarter because leading experts say Mozart makes babies smarter.
kari," And the beauty part is that the babies don't even have to listen 'cause they're asleep! You know, I wish my parents played Mozart when I slept because half the time I don't even know what the heck anyone's talking about."
kari," Oh, there's really no need, Mrs. Parr. I can totally handle anything this baby can dish out. [cooing] Can't I, little baby? I can handle it. Who can handle it?"
syndrome, Too late! Fifteen years too late.
violet, But you said we weren't supposed to use our powers.
dash, Mom?
violet, I've never done one that big!
dash, We're dead! We're dead!
violet, It blew up!
dash, We survived but we're dead!
mirage, We have a confirmed hit. Target was destroyed.
syndrome," Ah, you'll get over it. I seem to recall you prefer to ''work alone''. [evil laughter]"
syndrome, Or what?
syndrome," That sounds a little dark for you. Well, go ahead."
syndrome, [laughing] Show me.
syndrome, I knew you couldn't do it. Even when you have nothing to lose. You're weak. And I've outgrown you.
dash, You want to go toward the people that tried to kill us?
violet, Do you expect us to swim there?
dash," Thanks, mom."
violet," lf you haven't noticed, mom, we're not doing so hot either."
dash, What?!
violet,You heard her.
violet, But you said never to use...
violet," I know what I said! [sighs] Remember the bad guys on those shows you used to watch on Saturday mornings? Well, these guys are not like those guys. They won't exercise restraint because you're children. They will kill you if they get the chance. Do not give them that chance."
violet, Mom?
violet, There's something I...
dash, As fast as I can?
violet," Mom! Mom, what happened on the plane. I'm sorry. [stammering] I wanted to help. I mean, when you asked me to... I'm sorry."
mirage," He's not weak, you know."
syndrome, What?
mirage, Valuing life is not weakness.
syndrome," Oh, hey. Look, look...if you're talking about what happened in the containment unit, I had everything under control."
mirage, And disregarding it is not strength.
syndrome," I called his bluff, sweetheart, that's all. I knew he wouldn't have it in him to actually..."
mirage," Next time you gamble, bet your own life!"
guard, Hey!
dash," Well, not that this isn't fun, but I'm gonna go look around."
violet," What do you think is going on here? You think we're on vacation or something? Mom and Dad's lives could be in jeopardy. Or worse, [whispering] their marriage."
dash," Their marriage? So, the bad guys are trying to wreck Mom and Dad's marriage."
violet," Oh, forget it. You're so immature."
dash," Okay, I'm gonna go look around."
violet, Mom said to stay hidden.
dash, I'm not gonna leave the cave. Sheesh!
dash, [echoing] Cool!
dash, [echoing] Cool!
dash," Vi, Vi!"
violet, What did you do?
guard 1, Huh? What?
guard 2," Uh, I didn't say anything.  __________________________________________SCENE 26__________________________________________"
robot," Identification, please."
dash," Hey! Hey, Violet! Come here, look."
violet, What?
dash, It talks!
violet, What?
dash, There. That one.
robot, Voice key incorrect.
violet, ''Voice key''?
robot, Voice key incorrect.
violet, Wait a second...
dash, What do we do?
violet, Run!
dash, Where are we going?
violet, Away from here!
mirage, There isn't much time.
mirage, [choking] Please...
mirage, [choking] Family survived the crash. They're here on the island!
mirage," [gasping, coughing]"
mirage, Hello. You must be Mrs. Incre--
mirage, They might've triggered the alert.
mirage, Security's been sent into the jungle. You better get going.
guard, Think they're supers?
violet," Dash, remember what Mom said."
dash, What?
guard 2, Hey! Stop talking!
guard 3, Hold it! Freeze!
violet," Dash, run!"
dash, What?
violet, Run!
dash, Oh yeah!
guard, What the--?! They're supers!
guard 2, Get the boy! Show yourself!
guard, Hey!
dash," Ha, ha!"
dash, I'm alive. Yeah!
dash, Uh-oh.
guard," I know you're there, Little Miss Disappear."
guard, You can't hide from me.
guard, There you are.
dash, Hey!
dash, Don't touch my sister!
dash, How are you doing that?
violet, I don't know!
dash," Whatever you do, don't stop!"
violet, Mom! Dad! Hey!
violet, We were so worried about you.
dash, Wow.
violet, Whoa.
syndrome," Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, time out! What have we here? Matching uniforms? Oh, no! Elastigirl? [laughs] You married Elastigirl? Whoa! And got busy! It's a whole family of supers! Looks like I've hit the jackpot! Oh, this is just too good!"
syndrome," Huh? Huh? Oh, come on! You gotta admit, this is cool. Just like a movie! The robot will emerge dramatically, do some damage. Throngs of screaming people! And just when all hope is lost, Syndrome will save the day! I'll be a bigger hero than you ever were!"
syndrome," Oh, I'm real. Real enough to defeat you! And I did it without your precious gifts, your oh-so-special powers. I'll give them heroics. I'll give them the most spectacular heroics anyone's ever seen! And when I'm old and I've had my fun, I'll sell my inventions so that everyone can be superheroes. Everyone can be super. And when everyone's super...no one will be. [evil laughter]"
soldier, Fire at will!
dash, Um..dad?
violet," Well, I think Dad has made some excellent progress today but I think it's time we wind down now."
guard," Hey, look. Hey! Every time they run, you take a shot."
guard 2," Yeah, okay."
dash," Hey, how about a rocket?"
violet, You don't have to. Use the coordinates from the last launch.
mirage, Say please.  __________________________________________SCENE 28__________________________________________
honey, What?
honey, What?
honey," I, uh...put it away."
honey, Why do you need to know?
honey, Uh-uh! Don't you think about running off doing no derrin'-do! We've been planning this dinner for two months!
honey, My evening's in danger!
honey, ''Greater good''? I am your wife! I'm the greatest good you are ever gonna get!
man, Run!
woman, My baby!
man, The supers have returned!
woman, Is that Fironic?
man, Fironic?
woman," No, Fironic has a different outfit."
syndrome," No, no, I'm a new superhero! I'm Syndrome!"
syndrome," All right, stand back."
syndrome, Someone needs to teach this hunk of metal a few manners.
syndrome," Ha, ha!"
dash, Are we there yet?
violet," Super-duper, Dad!"
dash, [laughing] Let's do that again.
dash, Violet?
dash, Dad!
violet," I'm okay, mom. Really."
violet, The remote controls the robot!
dash," Hey, dad! Throw it, throw it!"
dash, Got it!
violet," Mom, I've got it! I've got the remote!"
dash, It's coming back!
dash, That wasn't right.
violet, Give me that!
dash, It's getting closer!
violet, It doesn't work!
dash, It's getting closer!
violet, We're not going anywhere!
syndrome, Huh? No!
old man," Hey, did you see that? Eh? That's the way to do it. That's old school."
rick," We've frozen all of Syndrome's assets. lf he even sneezes, we'll be there with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs. The people of this country are indebted to you."
rick," Let the politicians figure that one out. But I've been asked to assure you we'll take care of everything else. You did good, Bob."
violet," [stammering] Yeah, I just... yeah."
violet," Thanks, Dad."
dash, That was so cool when you threw that car!
dash," Hey, mom! That was sweet when you snagged that bad guy with your arm and kinda whiplashed him into the other guy. It was so sweet!"
dash, ...aced those guys that tried to kill us! That was the best vacation ever! I love our family.
rick, Here we are.
syndrome," Shh. The baby is sleeping. You took away my future. I'm simply returning the favor. Oh, don't worry, I'll be a good mentor. Supportive, encouraging. Everything you weren't. And in time, who knows, he might make a good sidekick. Ha ha!"
syndrome, No!
syndrome," This isn't the end of it! I will get your son, eventually. I'll get your son!"
syndrome," Oh, no."
dash, Does this mean we have to move again?
kid," Oh, man. That was totally wicked!  __________________________________________SCENE 30__________________________________________"
violet," Do we have to have cheerleaders at the track meet? I mean, what is that all about?"
girl," Well, I always thought it was more like a..."
tony, Hey.
violet, Hey.
tony," You're, uh, Violet, right?"
violet, That's me.
girl," See you, Vi."
tony, You look different.
violet, I feel different. Is different okay?
tony," Hey, different is...[clears throat] Different is great. [stammering] Would you wanna..."
violet, Yeah?
tony, Do you think maybe...[stammering]...you and I...you know...
violet, Yeah?
tony, Do you...
violet, Shh. I like movies. I'll buy the popcorn. Okay?
tony," [stammering] A movie. There you go. Yeah...yeah! Wait, wait...so Friday?"
violet, Friday.
bob," Come on, run! Pick up the pace! Move it, move it! Pace it! Slow down just a little bit! Don't give up! Make it close!"
helen, Second!
bob," Close second, close second. Yeah!"
bob, That's my boy!
helen," Dash, I'm so proud of you."
dash, I didn't know what the heck you wanted me to do.
underminer," Behold the Underminer! I am always beneath you, but nothing is beneath me! I hereby declare war on peace and happiness! Soon all will tremble before me!"
