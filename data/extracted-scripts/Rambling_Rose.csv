Speaker,Dialogue
willcox hillyer,I see. Outside it.
dave wilkie,"That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me."
willcox hillyer,"Um-m, well..."
willcox hillyer," Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs."
buddy,Sure. Let me take your suitcase.
waski,You can stop it right now.
rose," Yes, sir."
mother, Oh. Did you say something?
waski,"I do, too."
daddy," All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension."
buddy,It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
doll,She's watching the car again?
buddy,Yeah.
doll,I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
waski,"Yeah, I know."
buddy,"Oh, Waski, you don't know anything."
waski,"I do, too!"
buddy,"All right, what do you know?"
waski,Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
doll," Well, don't tell Mother."
waski,Do you think I'm crazy?
daddy," Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?"
rose," Oh, I don't know, I... I..."
mother," Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?"
rose," No, ma'am, I'm just fine."
daddy, Hmmp. Did you realize there are a thousand Coca-Cola millionaires in Atlanta?
buddy,There goes Mother.
doll,Yeah.
doll,Okay.
doll,I think she's gonna kiss him.
buddy,At least.
rose,"Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!"
daddy," All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it."
rose, Don't make me... me... me... get up!
doll, Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
buddy," He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!"
buddy,Is that all?
daddy,"All right, that is enough of this nonsense, and I mean enough! Get up off this floor, Rose, and put your damned tit back in your dress! Do you hear me, girl, get up off of that floor!"
rose,Ohh-hhh... ohh...
buddy,"No, I'm awake. What's the matter?"
buddy," But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?"
rose,"Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!"
buddy,"But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?"
rose,"I fell madly in love with him when he called me Rosebud. You know that first day when I come and he said I looked graceful like a capital letter S and called me Rosebud? I fell madly in love with that man right then.  But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a good man and won't have nothin' to do with me."
buddy,"Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?"
buddy,"Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?"
rose," Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things."
buddy,"But I'm curious, Rose."
buddy," It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot."
buddy,"Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little?"
buddy,"Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you."
rose,"Ohh-hh, ohhh-hh...  Ouch! Oh-hh... ohh..."
buddy, I said I wouldn't.
rose," Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as I've been please have pity on me and don't ruin me by telling them what I did. I know it was bad, it was bad and dumb. But mostly it was dumb, I didn't mean you no harm, I'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that's the truth. I love you. But they'd think I did, they'd think I was awful, they'd despise me and hate me..."
mother,"This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that."
buddy," Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?"
mother,"This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this."
buddy," Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!"
mother,"No, you didn't say that, Brother."
buddy,"Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts"
waski," He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!"
buddy,"Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!"
mother,"Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?"
buddy,She's getting herself up to go out.
mother,"Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  ... my, you're... looking pretty..."
daddy," That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why."
mother," In a perfectly proper way, of course."
daddy,"Yes, of course."
rose,"My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose."
daddy,"You were up late last night, Brother."
buddy,"Well, a little."
daddy,Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
buddy," Well, yeah."
rose,My feet sure do hurt.
daddy,She has made contact.
daddy,I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
buddy,I don't know.
daddy,The girl strikes like a cobra.
rose," Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't."
rose," Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't."
rose, Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
daddy,"Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!"
mother, I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
daddy,I am not being brutal to her!
mother,"You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen."
daddy," Darlin', it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --"
mother,"Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys."
mother,"Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!"
rose," Ohhh-hh, ohhh..."
mother,"Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?"
rose,"Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it."
mother,"No, Rose, he'll help you."
rose," Never again, never again..."
mother," I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry..."
mother," Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her."
daddy,"Well, I have a pretty good idea."
doll,What's happening?
rose, Pray for me...
daddy,"Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed.  I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her."
rose," Yeah, it's kinda nice."
daddy,Rose! Rose! Open this goddamn door! Open it or I'll break it down!
buddy,"Daddy, what's the matter?"
daddy,"No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas."
daddy," This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded."
mother," But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?"
daddy," In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something."
rose, I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
daddy, I don't believe it.
rose,"It's so, Mr. Hillyer."
daddy,"All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!"
mother,Honey!
daddy,"She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly."
buddy,"I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it."
mother," Yes, go on."
daddy," Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself."
mother," Better off? How could she ever find love and happiness, if you did what you're talking about? Are you insane?"
mother," No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her."
daddy," Well, I thought I'd seen the limit, but these are the most great, gaga epizootics she's ever had."
rose," I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?"
buddy," Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right."
daddy,"Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,"
rose,"And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right!"
rose, Okay.
rose," Oh, Mr. Hillyer! I just can't stand to say goodbye!"
mother, Maybe Brother is right. Maybe so.
daddy,"Are they polar bears, too?"
daddy," Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose."
daddy," A wonderful woman, boy."
willcox hillyer,"All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?"
willcox hillyer,I'm not blubbering.
