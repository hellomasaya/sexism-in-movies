Speaker,Dialogue
"november 16, 1995",Minor Revisions
mayor,"The Arroyo Seco freeway is just the beginning.  We're planning freeways from Downtown to Santa Monica, from the South Bay to the San Fernando Valley.  Twenty minutes to work or play is the longest you'll have to travel."
reporter,How many bodies you think Mickey Cohen'll be able to hide in all that cement?
mayor,"We're selling an image, gentlemen. Beautiful weather.  Affordable housing.  Trouble-free transportation.  And the best police department in the world to keep it all running smoothly."
mayor,"But with a second rate Al Capone out there, L.A. looks like Chicago in the '30s.  Something has to be done."
police officer,"Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest."
cohen,Bullshit.  What's the charge?
police officer,Non-payment of federal income tax.
cohen,Bullshit.
reporter,"How's your bullshit now, Mickey?!"
loew,"Today is an auspicious one for the city of Los Angeles.  Mickey Cohen has just been sentenced to ten years in federal prison for failure to pay income tax. As the District Attorney for Los Angeles County, it is my pleasure to declare our great city organized crime free.  It is truly the dawning of a new day."
stompanato,Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
bud,"And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. Capisce, shitbird?"
stensland,"Bud ain't in the mood for small talk, Stompanato."
stompanato,"Look, Mickey C's doing time and half the other guys who'd hire me are dead or left town.  I need money.  If your snitch-fund's green, I'll get you some fucking-A collars."
stompanato,"There's this guy.  He's blond and fat, about forty.  Likes the ponies.  Been pimping his wife to cover his losses.  Knocks her around to keep her in line."
stompanato,I figure the address is worth twenty.
stompanato,"Yuletide cheer, fellas."
bud,"Happy New Year, greaseball."
stensland,"Leave it for later, Bud.  We got to pick up the rest of the booze and get back to the precinct."
bud,"Central, this is 4A-31.  Send a prowler to 1486 Evergreen.  White male in custody.  Code 623 point one.  Domestic assault and battery.  I won't be here, but they'll see him."
bud,Touch her again and I'll know about it.  Understand?  Huh?
bud,You got someplace you can go?
bud,Go get yourself fixed up.
wife," Merry Christmas, huh?"
stensland,"You and women, partner.  What's next?  Kids and dogs?"
actress,"Brett Chase told me you're the cop who busted Bob Mitchum.  These 'Badge of Honor' guys like to pretend, but being the real thing must be a thrill."
jack,Let's go someplace quiet.  I'll give you the low-down on Mitchum.
actress,You got your handcuffs with you?
jack,Two sets.
actress,I'll get my coat.
hudgeons,Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
jack,"Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from Hush-Hush magazine."
actress,I know who he is.
hudgeons,We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
jack,Is she?
hudgeons,"Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner."
jack,"You lost me, Sid.  Who?"
hudgeons,"Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?"
jack,I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
hudgeons,Jack!  It's Christmas!
jack,No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
hudgeons,"They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree."
jack,Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
hudgeons,I like it!  I like it!
jack,Police!
hudgeons,Cut!  Wrap it!
hudgeons," It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy?"
jack,"Yeah, it's subtle."
hudgeons,"Remember: you heard it first here, off the record, on the Q.T. and very Hush-Hush."
exley,What's on the call sheet?
young officer,"A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself."
exley,Decorated?
young officer,"With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir."
exley,I get the idea.  You got a description?
young officer,"Of his penis, sir?"
lynn,"A case each of gin, Scotch, and rum.  Everything top shelf.  None of that watered-down stuff you push on Errol Flynn."
owner, Sounds like a helluva party.
owner,You want it delivered?
lynn,Before five tomorrow.
owner,"I'll be right with you, Lynn."
bud,Merry Christmas.
lynn,"Merry Christmas yourself, Officer."
bud,"That obvious, huh?"
lynn, It's practically stamped on your forehead.
meeks,Get lost why don't you?
meeks,I got a license for that.
meeks,Cut me some slack.  I used to be a cop.
bud,Turner Meeks?  Never heard of you.
lynn, We just call him Buzz.
bud,You okay?
patchett,She's fine.
bud, I'm not asking you.
bud,Somebody hit you?
lynn,It's not what you think.
bud,What is it then?
susan,"You got the wrong idea, Mister. I'm fine."
lynn, But it's nice to know you care.
stensland,What's going on?
bud,You know him?
stensland,Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
reporter,"Captain Smith, I --"
dudley,Drop the formalities; it's Christmas Eve.  Call me Dudley.
reporter,"Dudley, I came up with a title for the story.  I'm calling it ""Silent Night with the L.A.P.D."""
dudley,Excellent.  How's this?  The sanctity of the night is an invitation to the darker criminal element.  Our vigilance will not be diminished.
dudley,That's Smith with an S.
dudley,"This way, gentlemen."
young officer,Two police officers were assaulted in a bar.  Brown and Helenowski.
dudley,This is Sergeant Ed Exley.  Son of the legendary Preston Exley.  He's the watch commander tonight and a damn fine job.
dudley,I was fortunate enough to be partnered with his father when I was a rookie.  It makes a man feel old.  That's a fact.  Feel free to get a feel for the place.
dudley,"A word with you, lad."
dudley,To the memory of your father.
dudley,The day he got the Medal of Valor. A simpler time.
exley,To the solving of crimes that require absolute justice.
dudley,That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
exley,The youngest applicant by eight years.
dudley,You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
exley,I was thinking Detective Bureau.
dudley,"You don't have the eye for human weakness to be a good detective. Or the stomach.  You're a political animal, Edmund."
exley,You're wrong.
dudley,Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
exley,"Dudley, we've been over this."
dudley,Answer yes or no.
exley,I... No.
dudley,"Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund."
exley,No.
dudley,Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
exley,No.
dudley,Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
exley,No.
dudley,"Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau."
exley,"I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father."
dudley,At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
stensland,"Hey, partner.  Grab a cup."
bud,I got to write my report first.
jack,Hi... I'd like to get a delivery to Beverly Hills.
jack,"Look, a friend of mine gave me this number.  I just --"
jack,This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
jack,I just called it.
jack, A bootleg...
exley,"All right, men.  You've had your fun.  Time to break it up."
stensland,"Fucking Exley.  Guy's got a pole so far up his ass, every time he farts the flag waves."
exley,What's going on?
cop,They got the spics who japped Helenowski and Brown.  Helenowski lost an eye and Brown's got brain damage.
exley,I have the report right here. They're home with bruises and muscle pulls -- Oh shit...
stensland,"For ours, Pancho. And you're getting off easy."
jack,"White, you better get a lease on Stens before he kills someone."
garcia,"Fuck you, pendejo."
bud,Yeah yeah...
garcia,And fuck your mother too.
exley," Stop, Officer!  That's an order!"
exley,You're going in my report!  All of you!
hall," As Exley struggles, a cop opens the door to the store room.  Bud slings Exley inside, then slams the door tight.  Exley is locked in.  As Bud moves off, we hear POUNDING.  EXLEY  Let me out!  That's an order!"
cell block, The Herald Reporter and photographer enter unchaperoned and unnoticed.  Stensland swings like a madman.  That's when a flashbulb goes off.  Freezing everyone in black and white.  DISSOLVE TO:
chief,"Officer White, you've refused to cooperate with Internal Affairs. But you should know this is bigger than a police board.  Indictments may be handed down.  Quite frankly, we need police witnesses to offset the damage done to the Department's image.  Will you testify?"
bud,"No, sir.  I won't."
chief,District Attorney Loew.
loew,Bloody Christmas.  The press love to label.  You and Officer Stensland brought the liquor into the precinct.  Stensland was already drunk.  Do you see how appearing as a voluntary witness against him could offset the damage you've done to yourself?
bud,I won't do it.  I won't testify against my partner or anyone else.
loew,This man is a disgrace.
chief,"Your badge and gun, Officer."
chief,"This is the new L.A.P.D., White. You're suspended from duty and dismissed."
chief,"Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?"
exley,"The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department."
dudley,Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer.
exley,White's a mindless thug.
dudley,"No, Edmund.  He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time."
chief,"I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, forthright men the public can admire."
exley,"I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right."
chief,And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
exley,Detective lieutenant.
chief,"Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't"
exley,"I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective."
loew," Before we start polishing our laurels, it would look better if we had a corroborative witness."
dudley,That'll be hard to come by.  The men hate a turncoat.
exley,"Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him."
chief,"All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes."
dudley,"You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?"
exley,"Yes, Dudley.  I am."
dudley,So be it.
jack vincennes," Looking sharp, he strides down the hall, enters the..."
dudley,"Sergeant, we'll get right to it. Nine civilian witnesses have identified you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia."
loew,But my office has a stellar witness who will tell the grand jury that you hit back only after being hit.
jack,What do I have to do?
loew,"Testify against the three officers who have already earned their pensions.  Our key witness will testify roundly, but you can plead ignorance to questions directed at the other men."
chief,"I'll guarantee you a slap on the wrist.  A brief suspension followed by a temporary transfer from Narcotics to Ad Vice.  When you transfer out of Vice, you'll be back on the show."
jack,"The show, sir?"
chief,"Badge of Honor, Vincennes.  We need to tone down your profile for a bit."
dudley,"John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now."
jack,Okay.  I'll do it.
chief,"Dismissed, Vincennes."
chief,So be it.  Detective Lieutenant.
chief,"Ace them at the grand jury tomorrow, son.  Wear the smart- looking suit and ace them.  And, Ed?  Lose the glasses."
jack,You're the key witness?
exley,That's right.
jack,I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
exley,Throwing me?
jack,"Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?"
exley,You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
jack,"You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs."
exley,What about you?
jack,I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart.
clerk,Edmund J. Exley to chambers.
jack,"Just remember, Bud White'll fuck you for this if it takes the rest of his life.  They already suspended him.  Just pray he cops a deal and stays on the Department because that is one civilian you do not want on your case."
bud,That an old fashioned you're drinking?  My name's Bud.
redhead,Nobody was born with the name Bud.
bud,"They stick you with a name like Wendell, you look for an alias."
redhead,"What do you do, Bud?"
bud,"I'm sorta between jobs.  Look, what do you say we, uh..."
dudley,"Lad, may I have a word with you?"
bud,"This business, Captain?"
dudley,Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables.
bud,Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
dudley,He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
bud,"Captain, what do you want?"
dudley,Call me Dudley.
bud,"Dudley, what do you want?"
dudley,"Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?"
bud," Yeah, I hate them."
dudley,And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
bud,What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  He's one year from his pension.
dudley,"It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?"
bud,He helped me out once.  That's all.
dudley,"Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing."
bud,Him and me both.  Fucking Exley.
dudley,Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
bud,What do you want?
dudley,"Wendell, I want you to come to work for me."
bud,Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
dudley,They're yours.  Take them.
bud,"I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?"
dudley,Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
bud,How?
dudley,"I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide."
bud, Homicide?  A detective?
chief,"Your talents lie elsewhere, Wendell.  It's a muscle job and shooting job.  You'll do what I say and not ask questions.  Do you follow my drift?"
bud, In Technicolor.
dudley,Will you work for me?
bud,Of course... But how?
dudley,"How what, Wendell?"
bud,How'd you get them to retract?
chase,I'm not a policeman.  I just play one on television.  But I think I can answer for them.  To help people.  That's why I do the show.
chase,To protect and serve.  It's not just a motto.
chase,That one.  In the sweater.  They also serve who only stand and wait.
chase,"Jack, I'll see you Monday on set."
jack,I won't be there.  They're toning down my profile.
printing press," The latest issue of Hush-Hush flies through.  On the cover:  ""Gail Russell Caught In Love Nest.  Nymph or No?"""
bud,Domestic.  Assault and battery.
carlisle,"Ready to go, Bud?"
bud,I'll be there in five minutes.
bud,I hear you like to hit women.
prisoner,My wife.  She's dropping charges so it's none of your business.
cohen,What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
stompanato,They shot him in his library.
cohen,"I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?"
stompanato,Nobody.  At least not yet.
cohen,And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
stompanato,Gone.  Not a trace.
cohen,Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper!
vice captain,"Picture-book smut, gentlemen. There's been a bunch of it found at collateral crime scenes lately. Mostly narcotics and prostitution collars."
vice captain,"Look who's back from suspension. We're honored, Sergeant Jack."
jack,Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book
vice captain,"Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?"
jack,"Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics."
vice captain,Oh?  Anyplace else?
jack,Working whores with squad two.
vice captain,Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
vice captain,"They're yours.  Make a major case, Sergeant.  It's the only way you're getting out of here."
vice captain,"Dismissed, gentlemen."
vice captain,"Roll, Vincennes.  No sidetracks. This is Ad Vice, not Narco."
hudgeons,Hush-Hush.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
hudgeons,"Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I need copy."
jack,No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
hudgeons,Something good?
jack,"Don't know.  I'm chasing picture books.  Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  It's well done stuff.  I thought you might have heard something."
hudgeons,Not a word.
jack,What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
hudgeons,"No.  No, I've heard bupkis.  Jack, I'll talk to you later.  Call me when you get something I can use. Smut's from hunger.  For sad sacks who can't get their ashes hauled"
exley," You're just a thug, White.  That's all you'll ever be."
dudley,You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
exley,His blood's always up.
dudley,Then maybe you should stay away from him all the time.
stensland,"Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good."
bud,"Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?"
stensland,"Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight."
bud,What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
stensland,No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
bud,What are you talking about?
stensland,"It's confidential, Bud.  Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. Hush-Hush.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it."
voice,Squad call!  Nite Owl Coffee Shop One-eight-one-two-four Cherokee! Multiple homicides!  Multiple homicides!  Code three!
service runway," Crisscrossed drag marks connect, lead to a walk-in..."
rookie,"S-s-sir, there's a captain outside wants to see you."
exley,Don't get sick!  Not in here!
exley,"Sir, I took the call.  It's my case."
dudley,"Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it."
exley,"Yes, I do, sir."
dudley,It's mine.  I'll make you my second in command.
pinker,We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
exley,Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
dudley,Why?
exley,We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
dudley, Get on it.
forensics cop,"We got an I.D. on one of the victims, sir... I think it's Dick Stensland."
dudley,"With Mickey Cohen in prison, Los Angeles is organized crime free. The Chief wants it to stay that way, Edmund.  The means are not for the weak-hearted."
dudley,"Come, Wendell, you can do better than that."
flatnose,"I know things.  I hear things. Like with the Mick inside, things are on this weird slowdown. "
dudley,"We know all that, lad.  Tell us, who do these shooters work for?"
flatnose,I don't know.  No one knows. Maybe they're mavericks.  You want a prostie roust?  Huh?  Some narco action?  What do you want?!
dudley,"We want you to go home.  Uncuff him, Michael."
dudley,Mr. Sifakis is a known loan shark from San Francisco.  He arrived this afternoon at Union Station. Looking for business opportunities in our fair city.  An organized crime associate in need of re- education in the ways of polite society.
flatnose,Motherfuckers!
dudley,"It's part of the play, Edmund.  A sincerity test."
dudley, Sit him back down.
dudley,"Wendell, you need to accompany Detective Lieutenant Exley on official police business.  I'll finish up here."
bud,Where are we going?
exley,"It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?"
coroner,"Call me crazy, but for a second I thought it was Rita Hayworth."
exley,We need you to I.D. the body. There's no next of kin and you knew him best.  So tell me...
exley,Is that Dick Stensland?
bud,"Yeah, that's Stens."
exley,Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
bud,What happened?
exley,"Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people."
coroner,"Is this your daughter, Mrs. Lefferts?"
exley,We know this is difficult.  Just take your time and look again.
exley,"When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?"
dudley,"'Nite Owl Massacre.'  Hyperbole aside, this is a heinous crime that requires a swift resolution. The public will demand it and this department will provide it.  Six victims.  One of them, one of our own -- Dick Stensland.  As it happens, he was a Nite Owl regular.  In the wrong place at the wrong time."
dudley,"Robbery looks like the motive.  We have rubber glove prints on the register and preliminary forensics strongly lean toward a trio of gunmen.  We do have one hot lead, so listen well.  Three Negro youths were seen last night discharging shotguns in the air at Griffith Park. A park ranger I.D.ed them as driving a 1948 to 1950 Mercury Coupe, purple in color.  An hour ago, a canvassing crew found a news vendor who saw a purple Merc Coupe parked across from the Nite Owl around 3:00 A.M."
dudley,The D.M.V. worked all night to get us a registration list on '48 to '50 purple Mercs.  There are 142 registered to Negroes in L.A. County.  Fifty two-man teams will shake three names apiece.  Hot suspects you'll bring here. Interrogation rooms have been set up.  They'll be run by Lieutenant Edmund Exley.  Hollywood Squad.
chief,"Enough on that.  Gentlemen, just go out and get them.  Use all necessary force.  The people of Los Angeles demand it."
exley,He might as well have put a bounty on them.
bud,Can you take them?  I got I got something I gotta do.
partner,"Christ, I don't know.  What if one of these names..."
bud,What I gotta do is for Stensland. My partner.
exley, watches everyone go.  Wishes he could be part of the action.  He spots Jack talking to his REDNECK partner for for the day.
redneck,"Where to, Trash?"
jack,"If we go by the list, we have about zero chance of making the collar.  But I know a guy who knows what's going on south of Jefferson.  I'm betting he could"
redneck,I don't know...
exley,I'll take those odds.  Take off.  We got it from here.
redneck,"Between the two of you guys, you should bring along a photographer."
bud,I need an address on a customer of yours.  Her name was Lynn.
owner,That's all I have to go on?
bud,"Yeah.  And I think you already know who I mean, so cough it up."
owner,Lynn Bracken.  There's a billing address and a delivery address.
bud,Give me both.  Billing first.
bud,Are you Pierce Patchett?
patchett,"I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office."
bud,I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
patchett,"I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?"
bud,Richard Stensland.
patchett,I don't know him.  Mr...
bud,Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
patchett, You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
bud,We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
patchett,Of course...
bud,Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating.
bodyguard,"Everything alright, Mr. Patchett?"
patchett," Fine, Philip.  Thank you."
bud,Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
patchett,"He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. Whatever you desire."
bud,"Thanks, but no thanks."
patchett,Against your code?
bud,"I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?"
patchett,Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
bud,No.
patchett,Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
bud,That's right.
patchett,"Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling."
bud, Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
patchett,I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
bud,You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
patchett,Wait.  Our deal still holds?
patchett,I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
bud,What little studio?
patchett,"There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon."
bud,That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
patchett,"No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --"
bud,I got her address.
patchett,"Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White?"
lynn,Hello?
older gentleman, Is it the cops?
jack,Leonard Bidwell?
jack,How's the left these days?
boxer,What's it to you?
jack,I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
boxer,"What do you want, Mr. Policeman?"
jack,You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
jack,How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A.
jack,We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
boxer,You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
jack,You wanna buy your brother ten years...?  You don't have to say anything.  Just look at this list and point.  Here.
boxer,"He's bad, so I'll just tell you. Sugar Ray Coates.  Drives a '49 coupe, a beautiful ride.  Don't know about shotguns, but he gets his thrills killing dogs.  He is righteous trash."
jack,That's five minutes from here.
older gentleman,"I don't understand, doll, we just got started."
lynn,"I'm sorry, but I'll make it up to you.  I promise."
older gentleman,"Gosh, kitten, I don't know..."
older gentleman,"Alright.  This time I'll go, but next time --"
bud," L.A.P.D., shitbird.  Get the fuck out of here or I'll call your wife to come get you."
lynn,I've been expecting you.  Pierce called.  Told me what happened to Sue.
lynn,"It's Officer White, isn't it?"
lynn,Can I get you a drink?
bud,"Yeah, plain scotch."
lynn,"I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?"
bud,Are you sorry she's dead?
lynn,Of course I am.  What kind of question is that?
bud,Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
lynn,No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
bud,"You use words like that, you might make me mad."
lynn,Yes.  But do you know?
bud,"Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention."
lynn,"That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating."
bud,Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
lynn,I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
bud,Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
lynn,"Like I said we were friendly, not friends."
bud,How'd she meet Patchett?
lynn,"Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little."
bud,Tell me about Patchett.
lynn,He's waiting for you to mention mention.
bud,"You want some advice, Miss Bracken?"
lynn,It's Lynn.
bud,"Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears."
lynn,"I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?"
bud,Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
lynn,You say 'fuck' a lot.
bud,You fuck for money.
lynn,There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
bud,Yeah.
lynn,Do you enjoy it?
bud,When they deserve it.
lynn,Did they deserve it today?
bud,I'm not sure.
lynn,But you did it anyway.
bud,"Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today."
lynn," Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute."
bud,"You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, Pierce Patchett."
lynn,He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
bud,He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
lynn,"No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print."
lynn,"It was nice meeting you, Officer."
bud,Look.  I want to see you again.
lynn,Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
bud, I don't know.
lynn, If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
bud, Forget I asked.  It was a mistake.
exley,L.A.P.D.
jack,Shit.  Someone beat us here.
jack,Hey.
carlisle,What the fuck are you guys doing here?
exley,Think of us as back-up.
jack,What do you got?
breuning,"Three Ithaca pumps, an empty box of double-ought buck and cash."
jack,"So long, Vice.  Badge of Honor, here I come."
carlisle,"Fuck you, Vincennes.  It's our collar."
exley,Quiet.  I'm ranking officer here. We go as a team.  End of story.
exley,Damnit...
jack,What?
exley,Glasses.
jack, Just don't shoot me.
jack,Freeze!
carlisle,"Ace him, Jack."
exley,"Shut up, Carlisle!"
second bedroom," Another black, RAY COATES, passed out on mattress, sur- rounded by empty beer cans.  Jack sticks his .38 in his back, starts to cuff him.  As the cuff ratchets down..."
exley,"Casitas Youth Camp... Coates twenty-two, a boxer... Manager saw them burning clothes."
dudley,"Ed, I want confessions."
exley,"I'll break them, sir."
jack,"You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?"
dudley,I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
exley,They call you Sugar Ray because of Ray Robinson?  They say Robinson can throw a four punch combination in one second.  Do you believe that?
exley,"You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?"
coates,Say what and so what.
exley,Did one of the officers work you over a little?
exley,"You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?"
coates,"Man, why do you keep asking me that?"
exley,"Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --"
coates,I never truck with no sissies!
exley,That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
coates,Believed what?
exley,"Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?"
coates,"Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business."
exley,"Sugar, Larry told me you went sissy up at Casitas.  You couldn't do the time so you found yourself a big white boy to look after you.  He said they call you 'Sugar' because you gave it out so sweet."
exley,"Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?"
coates,You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
exley,I heard you like to shoot dogs.
coates,Dogs got no reason to live.
exley,"Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?"
coates,"Man, what're you saying?"
exley,"Ray, we got the shotguns."
coates,I don't own no shotguns.
exley,Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
coates, Say what?
exley,"You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  You were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good."
coates,I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
exley,"Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?"
coates,"Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me."
exley,Where do they get their stuff? Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one.
coates,Roland Navarette.  Lives on Bunker Hill.  He runs a hole-up for parole absconders and sells red devils.
exley,I'm going to take a break.
exley,"You know, Ray, I'm talking about the gas chamber and you haven't even asked me what this is all about.  You got a big guilty sign around your neck."
dudley,"Masterful, Edmund.  Your father would've been proud.  This one's on the verge."
exley,"Fontaine next, but give Jones the newspaper.  I want him primed."
exley,"Larry, Ray Coates ratted you off.  He said the Nite Owl was your idea.  You want to tell me about it?"
exley,I think it was Ray's idea.  Talk and I think I can save your life.
exley,"Larry, this is a gas chamber job. If you don't talk, you'll be dead in six months."
exley,"Son, six people are dead and somebody has to pay.  It can be you or it can be Ray."
exley,"Larry, he called you queer.  He said at Casitas you took it up the ass.  He said --"
fontaine,I DIDN'T KILL NOBODY!
exley,Why'd you burn the clothes?
fontaine, I just wanted to lose my cherry. I didn't mean to hurt her.
exley,Hurt who?  Was she a hooker? Hurt who?
dudley,Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
exley,"She may still be alive, whoever she is."
jones,This newspaper shit ain't shit.
exley,Where's the girl?  Did you kill her?
exley,"You wanted Larry to lose his cherry, but things got out of hand.  Is that right?"
exley," Kick loose, Jones.  I know you made her bleed, but that doesn't mean you killed her."
exley," If that girl's alive, you've still got a chance on this one."
jones, I think she's alive.
exley, You think?
jack,He's good.  I'll give him that.
exley,Where is she now?  Did you sell her out?  Give her to some of your buddies?  Tell me where the girl is!
bud,One in six.  Where's the girl?
exley,"Officer White, put down that weapon and --"
bud,WHERE?!
jones,S-sylvester F-fitch one-o-nine and Avalon gray corner house...
bud,Give me one minute.

the kitchen," Sylvester Fitch sits naked at the table wolfing Rice Krispies and watching ""Badge of Honor"" on a flickering TV.  He looks up, sees the .38 before he sees Bud beyond it.  Fitch drops his spoon, raises his hands.  Bud SHOOTS him in the face.  Dead, Fitch just sits there.  Bud moves behind him.  Pulling a spare piece from an ankle holster, Bud FIRES back at the door from Fitch's line of fire, then puts the gun in Fitch's hand.  We hear the FRONT DOOR CRASH OPEN.  As Fitch slides off the chair to the floor, Bud dumps the Rice Krispies on him."
bud,Get her to the fucking hospital.
exley,A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
bud,Get the fuck away from me.
exley,How's it going to look on your report?
bud,It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  Justice.
exley,"You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard."
exley,'Give me one to feed the D.A.... Roland Navarette.  Lives on Bunker Hill.  Runs a hole-up for parole absconders.'

exley,Nobody move!

exley,I need the girl to give me a chronology of events.  No details. Just times.
nurse,Absolutely not.  She barely remembers her own name.
exley,But --
nurse,I was told the case was closed. Should I call your superior to double-check?
exley,No.  that won't be necessary.
older gentleman,You tell Mr. Patchett I have no intention of changing my vote.
older gentleman,"It may surprise some, but a mature man, enlightened by the facts, can change him mind..."
chief,"Edmund J. Exley has amassed a brilliant record in his seven years with the L.A.P.D.  Recently he evinced spectacular bravery in the line of duty.  It is my honor to present him with our highest honor, the Medal of Valor."
dudley,Your father would've been proud.
exley,"There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --"
dudley,There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
exley,Something's wrong.  I feel it inside.  Doesn't that sound crazy?
dudley,Breaking a big case sticks you in a whirlwind.  A little self-doubt? It's natural.  Just keep it inside.  Between you and you.
chase,This election is about the future of law enforcement in Los Angeles. Ellis Loew represents that future. So dig deep and let's get a moral man re-elected.
hudgeons,"You're back, boychick."
jack,"Sid, how are they hanging?"
hudgeons,Down around my ankles.
hudgeons,You remember Matt Reynolds?
hudgeons,The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
jack,"What's he doing here, Sid?"
hudgeons,"You tight with the D.A., trash?"
jack,"Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke."
hudgeons,How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
jack,And Reynolds?
hudgeons,He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks.  That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
hudgeons,Matt!  Over here!
hudgeons,That's D.A. Loew right there.
hudgeons,"You need a drink, kid... Jack, look after him a minute.  Kid, this is Jack.  No secrets between me and him."
reynolds,Have we met before?
jack,Yeah.
reynolds,Was it a party?
jack,Something like that.
reynolds," Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?"
jack,Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
reynolds,"Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all."
jack,Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
reynolds,"Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too."
jack,Really?  How?
reynolds," You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up."
jack,Yeah.  Me neither.
hudgeons,"Dutch courage, kid.  Drink up."
reynolds,I don't know if I should do this.
hudgeons,"Hey, it's not like you don't know how.  And Jack here has connections on 'Badge of Honor.' Pull this off and there'll be a part for you.  I smell a comeback. Don't you, Jack?"
jack,Loew's free.  Congratulate him.
hudgeons,"If Reynolds works his charms, which he will, this is the address where they'll be.  Meet me at midnight.  I guarantee all sorts of illegal activity."
jack,"Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?"
hudgeons,Where'd you hear that?
jack,Around.
hudgeons,"Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo."
hudgeons,What?
reynolds,I can't do it.
hudgeons,"Talk to him, Jack.  Tell him about the opening on the show."
jack,"I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz."
reynolds,And no one'll know about this?
jack,It'll be our secret.
reynolds,Showbiz.
dudley,"Where did you intend to start. Prostitution?  Gambling?  Go back to Cleveland, lad.  This is the City of Angels and you haven't got any wings."
lynn, Did you forget some --
lynn,"I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White."
bud,It's Bud.
lynn,You should see yourself.  You look like you're ten years old.
lynn,"If you'd called first, I wouldn't look this ridiculous."
lynn,You're wondering if Patchett told me to be receptive.
lynn,"It doesn't matter.  I like you, Bud.  I really do."
jack,"Come on, Sid.  Where are you?"
jack,It's Vincennes!  Open up!
hudgeons,Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
jack,"Sid, cut the crap.  I --"
hudgeons,Give me some Narco skinny.  I want to put out an all hop-head issue. Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.  Maybe tie it into the Rosenbergs.  You like?
jack,Shut up!
hudgeons," What's wrong, Trash?"
hudgeons,What happened with the kid and Loew?
hudgeons,You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
jack,He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
hudgeons,"Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera."
jack,Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
hudgeons,I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
hudgeons,Jackie!  Big V!  Let me get my camera!  Where are you going?!
bartender,"What'll it be, Jack?"
jack, A bottle of Scotch.
bartender,Hey!  Your change!
bud,Who was that guy who was here earlier?
lynn,It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
bud,"When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way."
lynn,So you saved her.
bud,Yeah.  But not for long.
lynn,"Do you like being a cop, Bud?"
bud,"I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective..."
bud,There's something wrong with the Nite Owl.  That prick Exley shot the wrong guys.  But they made him a hero and whoever killed my partner is still out there.
bud,In here I know it.  But I can't prove it.  I'm not a detective. I'm not smart enough.  I'm just the guy they bring in to scare the other guy shitless.
lynn,You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.
bud,"That simple, huh?"
clerk,"I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean."
exley,Clean?
clerk,More or less.
exley,Until he gunned down six people.
park ranger,"I asked my men, Lieutenant.  No one remembers any colored guys firing shotguns."
exley,Then who phoned in the report?
park ranger,Not us.
pinker,"Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?"
bud,I got a few Nite Owl questions.
pinker,"I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed."
bud,I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
pinker,What do you want to know?
bud,Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
pinker,You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  I can't think of anything.
bud,Whose shoe?
pinker,Susan Lefferts.
bud," If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?"
pinker,"It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away."
bud,But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
pinker,Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
pinker,"You know, there is one thing."
pinker,Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
bud,Ear plugs.
pinker,Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
bud,It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
pinker,What do you mean?
bud,It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
pinker,"Yeah, so..."
bud,"Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions."
bud,Five minutes.  That's all.
bud,Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
bud,"Ma'am, I'm sure she was."
bud,What was that boyfriend's name?
bud,Stens?  Was it Stens?
bud,Look at a picture for me.
bud,"You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?"
bud,What's through here?
bud,Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
bud,Buzz Meeks... Holy shit.
bud,Yeah.  A great big one.
bud,Here.  Compliments of the Los Angeles Police Department.
pinker,"Hey, just in time for our stomach of the week.  Frankfurters with sauerkraut, French fries, Coca-Cola, alcohol and sperm. Jesus, what a last supper."
exley,The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
pinker,Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
exley,What are you talking about?
pinker,"Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought."
exley,"Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions."
exley,Officer White?
exley, Under the house.
exley,I need an I.D. ASAP.  You talk only to me on this one.
jack,Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
exley,I need to speak to you.
jack,"Give me a minute, will ya?"
jack,Damnit... What?
exley,I want you to follow Bud White.
jack,Even I'm not that crazy.
exley,It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
jack,Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
exley,"Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?"
jack,"Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone."
exley,You make a mistake?
jack,Yeah.  My whole life.
exley,"Listen, I think I made a mistake, too."
jack,"I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession."
exley,Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
jack,What?
exley,It's a simple question.
jack,"You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, Lieutenant."
exley,Rollo Tomasi.
jack,"Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?"
exley,Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
jack,So what's the point?
exley,"Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?"
jack,I don't remember...
jack,"I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing this time, but I sure as hell can't see one."
exley,I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
jack,"The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant."
exley,I want to do it right.
jack,"Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar."
exley,A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
stompanato,"Wendell White, how's tricks, paesano?"
bud,"I ain't your paesano, you wop cocksucker."
stompanato,"What do you want, officer?"
bud,You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
stompanato,Should I?
bud,His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
stompanato,"Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared."
bud,More.
stompanato,More's gonna cost you.
bud,How 'bout I give you your balls back?
stompanato, Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
bud,Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
stompanato,"Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing."
door," Jack peels in, catches a glimpse of Bud and Stompanato. Too far away too hear anything, Jack quickly ducks out."
stompanato,Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
bud,"He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?"
stompanato,I don't know.  I swear it!
jack,He's in the Brown Derby with Johnny Stompanato.  Check that.  I gotta go.
exley,What's that for?
jack,Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
jack,Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
exley,Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
jack,Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
exley,What's Fleur-de-Lis?
jack,High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
exley,Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
exley,Check the bar.  I got the restaurant.
stompanato,"Hey, you want an autograph, write to M-G-M."
exley,Since when do two-bit hoods and hookers give out autographs?
stompanato,What?
exley,L.A.P.D.  Sit down.
exley,"Take a walk, honey, before I haul your ass downtown."
stompanato,You are making a large mistake.
exley, Shut up.  Being cut to look like Lana Turner doesn't mean you are Lana Turner.
jack,She is Lana Turner.
exley,What?
jack,She is Lana Turner.
exley,How was I supposed to know?
patchett,"I believe the Nite Owl's your area of expertise, Mr. Exley.  I saw you on television getting your medal.  And you're that other celebrity Hollywood policeman, aren't you?"
patchett,I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
exley, Bud White's been here?
patchett,"For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect."
exley,Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
patchett,"A vulgar term, but yes."
exley,What's her name?
patchett,Lynn Bracken.
exley,Why's she seeing Bud White?
patchett,Why do men and women usually see each other?
exley,Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
patchett,No.
exley,Not good enough.
patchett," Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen."
jack,Guy's as cool as they come.
exley,This is Exley.
exley,Tell him Sergeant Vincennes is coming in to talk to him.
jack,What are you going to do?
exley,I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
jack,"Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner."
exley,"Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley."
lynn,I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
exley,Really?  What did White say?
lynn,He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
exley,"Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down."
lynn,"He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?"
exley,Scotch.
lynn,I'm curious about you.
exley,Why?
lynn,Because Bud hates you more than he loves me.
lynn,It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
exley,"Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken."
lynn,The way you've underestimated Bud White?
pinker,God bless dental records.  Stiff used to be a cop.  Turner Meeks.
jack,Buzz Meeks?
pinker,You knew him?
jack,Of him.  He was around when I first joined the force.  A bad egg.
jack,"Come on, Exley.  Where are you?"
exley,How was I?
lynn,"Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best."
exley, You sound like you mean it.
lynn,The silver screen's loss is your gain.
exley,How about White?
lynn,You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
exley,I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
lynn,I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
exley,I'll take your word for it.
lynn,I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
lynn,Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
exley,"I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for."
lynn,You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
exley,"You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?"
lynn,"I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality."
exley,Some reality.
lynn,No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
exley,Why not?
lynn,Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
lynn,You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
exley, You're the first person to ever call me tough.
lynn,"Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself."
exley,"You, me and White, huh?"
lynn,"Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside."
in closet," Exasperated that he's still stuck in here, Sid Hudgeons checks his watch, shakes his head in disgust."
dudley,"John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad."
jack,"Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important."
dudley,Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.
jack,"You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?"
dudley,A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
jack,"Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it."
dudley,"What's this all about, lad?"
jack,Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
dudley,"You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?"
jack,It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
dudley," Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice."
dudley,"Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?"
jack,No.
dudley,Not even with Exley?
jack,"Have you a valediction, lad?"
jack,Rollo Tomasi...
dudley,"Sergeant Vincennes' body was found in Echo Park at ten o'clock this morning.  Killed by a single .38 round to the heart.  One of our own, gentlemen.  We cannot tolerate it.  Justice must be swift and merciless.  That's all."
dudley,"Edmund, a word with you.  We received a tip this morning.  Did Vincennes ever mention the name Rollo Tomasi?"
exley,No... Where'd the tip come from?
dudley,Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
dudley,"You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp."
bud,What work?
dudley,"I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. "
bud,"You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about."
dudley,"You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?"
bud,"Sure, boss.  Sure you can."
exley,I want to know what you and Jack Vincennes talked about last night. Anything and everything.  Start with the I.D. on the corpse.
pinker,An ex-cop.  Buzz Meeks.  I pulled his police academy photo.
exley,We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
pinker,I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
dudley,"This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell."
hudgeons,I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
dudley,It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
hudgeons,Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios.
hudgeons,Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
dudley,But you were business associates?
hudgeons,What does that have to do --
hudgeons,Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes!
dudley,Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
hudgeons,You think he had something to do with Vincennes getting iced?
dudley,Wendell.  I want full and docile cooperation on all topics.
hudgeons,"Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks.  From aviation, freeway construction.  But the man has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o."
dudley,And?
hudgeons,And what?
dudley,"Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships."
hudgeons,He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
dudley,And?
hudgeons,"In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --"
dudley,Wendell!
hudgeons,Get him away from me!
dudley,I wouldn't trade places with Edmund Exley right now for all the tea in China.
hudgeons,"Dudley, I thought you were gonna let the dumb bastard kill me.  And you!  Learn to pull those punches a little better."
hudgeons,"You can uncuff me now, fellas."
hudgeons,"Fellas?  Come on, we're friends.  We're --"
dudley,Hush-hush...
exley,Anything?
clerk,Nothing.
exley,"So on active duty, Meeks didn't"
clerk,Someone must've pulled the records.
exley,Where are the police academy files?
clerk,I don't have time.  I have --
exley,Just show me where they are!
bud,Did you talk to Exley?
lynn,Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
bud,I want to know about Exley.
lynn,"He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating."
bud,How'd you get to know so much about him?
lynn,"Come in out of the rain, Bud."
bud,You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
lynn,We talked.
bud,So tell me about it.
lynn, In the morning.
bud,No.  Now.  You fucked him.
lynn,I thought I was helping you.  I thought --
exley,Why?
bud,Lynn.
exley,She told you?
exley,Who told you?  Did Dudley have anything to do with you finding out?
exley,Listen to me.  Dudley killed Jack. It has something to do with Buzz Meeks.
exley,"Look.  Dudley and Meeks go way back.  Stensland, too."
exley,"Think, goddamn you.  Think..."
bud,"I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them."
exley,Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
bud,"Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot."
exley,"Stensland and Buzz Meeks.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus."
bud,"Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down."
exley,The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
bud,"Somebody got wind of it, killed them all."
exley,"It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?"
bud,Dudley.
exley,The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
bud,Dudley's guys.
exley,They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
bud,It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
exley,It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.
exley,"Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett."
bud,Let's just kill them.
exley,What?
bud,"For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice."
exley,"Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules."
bud,There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
exley,With a wrecking ball.  You want to help me swing it?
exley,Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
bud,Which one are you and which one am I?
exley,You expecting problems?
bud,Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
bud,Come on.
exley, What?
exley,I don't think his ex-cop did him much good.
exley,It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
bud,He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
exley,We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
bud,At least not anymore.
exley,Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
bud, Lynn.
exley,I got a guy who owes me in the Sheriff's department.  West Hollywood station.  He can be at her house in two minutes.
bud,Call him.
exley,Is she inside?
deputy,We took her to Hollywood Station for safekeeping.  Someone worked her over pretty good.  She wouldn't say who.
exley,Hold her as Joan Smith.  No one sees her unless I okay it.
deputy,"You got it, Exley.  And now we're even."
exley,Ellis Loew.
bud,What about him?
exley,Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
secretary,You can't go in there!
secretary,"Do you want me to call the police, Mr. Loew?"
exley,Ask for Captain Dudley Smith. We'll have a party.  Hot dogs and sauerkraut.
loew,It's okay.  These are police.  What do you want?
exley,I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
loew,On what evidence?
exley,None.  Call it a hunch.
loew, Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
exley,"Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?"
loew,Do you have any proof?
exley,The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
loew,"I'm not going to dignify youwith answers.  If you'll excuse me, I've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for."
loew,"Unless you're here to wipe my ass, I think we're through."
loew,"Don't try this good cop/bad cop with me.  I practically invented it.  And so what if some homo actor is dead.  Boys, girls, ten of them step off the bus to L.A. every day."
bud,Dudley Smith.  Spill.
loew,"Call him off, Exley!"
exley,I don't know how.
inner office," Bud heaves up the window, practically throws Loew through it.  Loew catches hold of the window framing.  Bud hammers his hands loose with a fist and pushes him through."
outside," Bud holds his leg.  Loew screams as coins, comb and wallet spill from his pockets, plummet toward the street below."
exley,Bud...
bud,"If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all."
loew,Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
exley,What's Dudley's scheme?
loew,"Dudley's rotten to the core.  He's taking over Mickey Cohen's rackets, his own hand-picked cops'll be the new franchise holders.  Because of those pictures I won't be able to prosecute.  Oh Jesus pull me up!"
loew,"Dudley's got everyone under his thumb.  Not just me, but the Chief of Police, the lieutenant governor, everybody!"
exley,Not everybody.  You tip-off Dudley and Officer White visits you alone next time.
bud,They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
exley,"We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn."
exley,You want to talk to her?
bud,You do it.  I'll check the files.
lynn, If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
exley,"Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?"
exley,A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
lynn," I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who."
exley,"Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did."
lynn, I know how he feels.
exley,"I don't know if it's pathetic or romantic, but when this is all over I'd like to see you again."
recorder,"I got your guns, Bud.  Signed in April 3rd, 1950.  Remember the First Western bank robbery?  They were used in that."
bud,I want to see them.
recorder,No can do.  I can't find them.
bud,What?
bud,You wanted to meet here?
exley,Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
exley,Shit... Come on.
bud,Too late.
bud,Here.
exley,You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
bud,A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
exley,"You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father."
exley,We got him!
exley,I'm thinking we might walk away from this.
dudley,"I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund."
exley,Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
dudley,"Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history."
exley,Why?
dudley,"A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides."
exley,And now you'll provide them.
dudley,"Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people."
dudley,"This isn't politics, Edmund. There won't be winners and losers when it's over..."
dudley,Just the living and the dead. It's always been that way in the Bureau.  You should've realized that before you became a detective.
dudley,We're policemen!  Let me do the talking.  They'll make you Chief of Detectives.
exley,No.
dudley,"Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?"
exley,Something like that.
dudley,Really?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
dudley,Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
dudley,Are you willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance they'll --
exley,Yes.  I do.
television screen," Where we're informed that tonight's episode of ""Badge of Honor"" is:  ""Dedicated to the memory of technical advisor Sergeant Jack Vincennes."""
exley,That's it.  That's the whole story.
loew,The press would have a field day with this.
chief," When in doubt, feed them a hero. In this case, we'll need more than one."
chief,Captain Edmund Exley.  Chief of Detectives.  Los Angeles Police Department.
exley, I tried to throw it all away and they give it back in spades.
exley,Where will you go?
lynn,"Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is."
exley,When?
lynn,"Right now, before I back down."
exley,Where is he?
exley,Thanks for the push.
exley,"You just did what you did.  No rank, no glory."
exley,From me to you.  It'll mean something if it's yours.
lynn,We should go now.
exley,Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
lynn,Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
