charlie," Shit happens, Riley.  RILEY   Only if you let it."
holo, I didn't kill him. He got bit and he killed himself. Same thing I woulda done. And you!
iley," You're dreaming, Cholo. They'd never let me in. They'll never let you in. We're the wrong kind."
ilitary woman, Stench! Ten o-clock!

chihuahua," Hey, this is not me. I did not do this to you. I am your friend. Put me down. Come on. I find out what went wrong."
riley," Just get me the car, or they'll carry you out of here inside that fucking hat."
iley, You okay?
chihuahua, My suit! You fucked up my new suit!
slack," I'm alright, I'M ALRIGHT!"
riley, Somebody shot the little fat man.
policeman," Yeah, I see that. You're under arrest."
ilhouetted man, How was Uniontown?

cholo," I got something else, too."
silhouetted man, Thank you.
cholo," No, thank you! Twenty grand. That's what I got comin' for last night. I never bothered to pick it up.  S"
ilhouetted man, You didn't?
cholo, Nope. I left it in the bank. Your bank. With all my other dough. rom all those other nights. I got enough now to buy me a place.
silhouetted man," You mean here? In the Green? The Silhouetted Man steps away from the window. Expensively dressed, in his early 60s, he is PAUL KAUFMAN. He sets down the highball glass Cholo gave him, gets out a proper champagne flute, and fills it from the bottle, smiling politely at Cholo."
kaufman," I'm sorry, Mister DeMora, but there's a very long waiting list."
cholo, How long?
kaufman, This is an extremely desirable location. Space is limited.
cholo, You mean restricted.
kaufman," Well, I do have a board of directors, a membership committee that has to approve..."
holo," I guess it takes more than money to become a ""member""."
kaufman, Take my advice. Withdraw your funds from the bank and spend them somewhere else.
cholo,  Don't do this to me. Don't do this to me.
aufman," I'm sorry, but..."
cholo," No, no, no. Three years! Three years I been cleaning up after you, taking out your garbage, and you tell me I'm not good enough? You're the one who's no good. You are no fucking good. And you are gonna let me in. You know why? Because I know what goes on around here. How many of your fucking ""members"" know what's in that garbage I take out for you?"
kaufman, Maybe we should talk about this when you're less excited.
riley,  Why you? In that arena. Why did the little fat man throw you in with those things?
slack," It wasn't the little man. It was the big man. The man upstairs. He's got his fingers in everything down here. If you can drink it, shoot it up, fuck it, or gamble on it, it belongs to him. He's just seein' that we get a few cheap kicks so we don't go thinkin' too hard about why he's eating steak and the rest of us are lucky to get the bones."
riley, Same question. Why you?
slack, They found out I was working with Mulligan and his people. Tired of eatin' off Cbones.
harlie, What can you do? Every place is the same.
riley, Places with people. I'm gonna find me a place where there ain't no people. North. Canada.
slack," Wherever you're going, take me ith you."
charlie, He won't. Riley likes to be alone. He might take me. Cuzz havin' me around is pretty much the same as bein' alone.  can make myself useful. And I an shoot.
slack, I can shoot. And I can be pretty fucking useful. I had training. I was gonna join the Army. Up the Green. Till somebody figured I'd be a better hooker than a soldier.
riley," I don't need to hear your story. Everybody's got a story, and I'm tired of hearin' them all!"
slack," What's your story, Riley?"
iley, I said everybody has a story. That was wrong. I don't have one. Daddy was a preacher. Mama kept the house. School. Engineering. Nothing bad ever happened to me......till everything changed.
lack, Everything changed for all of us. Whether we had a story or not.
charlie, Hey...
riley, Mulligan.
harlie," What are they gonna do? Kill him?  SLACK  Not right away. First, they'll try to get what they can out of him. About people like me. Riley puts his hand on her back."
cholo, We're taking the truck out. Get he guys.
foxy, Riley?
cholo," No, not him. Just the regular uys. Know what I mean?"
arrett,  You win. You got him in the brain.
cholo,  Takin' the truck out.
depot guard, Relax. Just target practise.
gus, Double or nothing?
barrett, Sure.
gus, Quit scratching around back there. You're tryin' ta fuck up my aim.
barrett, I'm just standin' here. I'm not doin' nothing.
cholo, What's that? Screaming practice?  GUNNER 
cholo,  Ain't our fight. Stenches are making it easy for us.  C  Let's grab the truck.
foxy, Should we send up some `sky flowers'?
cholo, No. Those things want to get in here...let `em in.
knipp," Phone call, sir."
kaufman," Thank you, Knipp. I'll take it."
kaufman, Yes?
kaufman, Ah. The one that got away.
kaufman," What do you want, Mister DeMora?  5"
cholo," I can't have a place in the Green, fine. I'll go find another place. But you know what I'm gonna need? Money. I want my money out of your bank. And I want the rest of the money out of your bank. And if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna blow you out of your fuckin' ivory tower. I've got Dead Reckoning.  INT. KAUFMAN PENTHOUSE - FIDDLER'S GREEN - NIGHT"
kaufman, That's unfortunate.
utherland, Trouble?
kaufman, We don't negotiate with terrorists. There are other options.
ecurity guard, Which one of you is Denbo?
kaufman, Mister Denbo. Come in. Can I offer you a drink?
riley, I don't drink.
kaufman," Well, then...please sit down."
riley," Nobody else is sitting. I think I'll just stand here, like the rest of you. While you tell me why I'm standing here."
aufman," We need you to repossess a vehicle that belongs to us. The vehicle you designed, Mister Denbo. Dead Reckoning has been stolen. By your second in command. I want him captured. Or killed. And I want my two-million-dollar piece of equipment returned.  R"
iley, The truck.
kaufman, Which has guns. Big guns. That could do a great deal of damage if he were to aim them at this city.
riley, Why don't you just send out your troops?
kaufman, But...there's nothing up north.
riley, That's the idea.
kaufman, Alright. You've named your price. An easy one to pay.  R
iley, One more thing. My friends. They go with me.
kaufman, Take them.
riley, How quickly?
charlie, I like the iron I already got.
soldier, This piece fires fourteen rounds a second.
harlie, I don't norm'ly need fourteen rounds.
slack, Better'n you. The safety's off.
riley,  You guys don't have to come out with me if you don't want to.
harlie, Me too. Just look at me you can tell I'd feel like a dick.
slack," Some shit, ain't it? Goin' out to save a place we don't give a fuck"
manolete, That's how I am called...Manolete. After the bullfighter.
kaufman, Teahouse.
pillsbury, I come here to do sumthin'. Not stann aroun'. Why we stann aroun'? Less go do sumthin'.
harlie, Geez. Cholo made a mess.
riley, Cholo didn't do all this.
riley, That fencing was pushed in from outside.
teahouse, You know how many stenches it would take to do that?
riley, There's a thousand of them out there for every one of us.
charlie, Good thing we're smarter.
slack, Look who's talkin'.
riley, They're getting smart. I saw it in
slack, The hell you shooting at?
charlie," That thing.  A  DEAD MAN steps out of the smoke! Before anyone can react, it grabs Slack's shoulder from behind! She whirls around. Pulls away. Is about to shoot when she sees AN ENTRY WOUND on the left side of the Thing's forehead."
anolete,  There's more of `em out there. I can hear `em. THERE'S MORE!
pillsbury," If they is more, we gonna need o guns. Pull `em out n'stann up wid us, like de man you ain't."
riley, Riley Denbo. Calling the Green.
sutherland, What?
charlie," Gotta go get the keys, Riley."
riley, Ain't no keys to get. Melted.
anolete, Screw keys. Hot wire the fucker.
manolete, I can't see!
slack, Even-Steven.
charlie, Not! That hurt! I didn't hurt you!
teahouse, What the fuck does a Samoan know about hot-wiring cars?
pillsbury, Five thousand cars. Stole. Every year in Samoa.
manolete, Fifty thousand in Mexico.
pillsbury, Mexico got a million cars. Samoa got five thousand. Every one. Stolen.
teahouse," God! Oh, GOD, WHAT'S THIS?!"
riley," I had a brother. Real brother, by birth. Bit. Hung on for six days. Before he turned. I was the one had to shoot him."
slack, And you said nothin' bad ever happened to you.
riley, That happened to my brother.
slack,  But you kept going.
iley," Got to, right?"
slack, up. Dead is dead. And that ain't you. And that ain't me.
aufman," I recognize that some of you are concerned. We've been threatened by a disgruntled employee. I've sent people out to take care of the problem. However, should something go wrong, I want to assure you that measures have been taken. I've established outposts. With food and supplies to support us on our way.  C"
liff, On our way? To where?
kaufman, Alternate sites have been chosen. Air transport has been arranged. For us and our families. As well as necessary support personnel.
cliff, What about all the others?
aufman, All the others can be replaced. y others.
liff, But...
kaufman," Cliff, let me talk to you for a moment."
kaufman," No, and I don't want to replace you. You have promise. A day may come when you earn yourself some responsibilities. Right now, the responsibilities are mine. All the responsibilities. It was my"
cliff," Yes, but..."
kaufman, No buts.
cliff, But...
kaufman, Take him out with the rest of the garbage. I won't be needing this man anymore.
utherland,  Pretty soon it's going to be one of us.
cholo," If I don't have this truck, I'm no different to Kaufman than that poor Mexican bastard out there."
cholo, He knows it's his ass if he doesn't.
slack, Never been out. Lived in the city since...it was a regular city.
iley, Pull over.
slack,  Huh?
riley, You said you were going to make yourself useful. Right now what I could use is for you to pull over.
riley," I made a deal with your boss. Find Cholo. I'm gonna do it. Keep him from blowing up the Green. I'm gonna do it, I don't want people to get hurt. Bring back Dead Reckoning... Sorry. That's where I stop. I didn't ask him for much, just guns, ammo, and a car. I've got the guns. I've got the ammo. And if I find Dead Reckoning I'm gonna have the best fucking car that's ever been built, and I'm taking it to Canada. If any of you don't like that idea..."
manolete, Some choice.
iley," Charlie, keep these two covered."
iley, You have a problem with that?
harlie," I like the way he thinks, too. Just look at me you can tell I like the way he thinks."
riley," Take another right.  SLACK  How do you know which way you're going? Riley holds up the ""Game Boy"". It BEEPS SOFTLY as the RED DOT shifts onto another MAP.  RILEY  I built a homing device into Dead Reckoning. If Cholo's anywhere within fifty miles, we can track him."
cholo, That's why we're here.
cholo," I'd rather have you in here than out there. KA-CHUNK! Cholo lifts his crossbow, pressing a loaded arrow up under Riley's chin. BLOOD TRICKLES.  CHOLO   Who's the smart one now?"

iley, Bring her over as soon as you can!
slack, Brian!
brian, We can't get out! There's no way out!
slack, There will be. Come with me.
brian," Daddy! Daddy's still locked up. Slack runs off with Brian, past a MANHOLE surrounded by canvas fences, ""CAUTION"" signs, and flaming OIL POTS. As MAINTENANCE WORKERS scramble out of the manhole... ...DEAD THINGS close in. The Workers, unarmed, pick up the ball-shaped pots and BOWL them at the Walkers. As the ""balls"" roll, their FIRES SWIRL, making them look like flaming comets.  S  ome of the   pots CRACK OPEN, creating POOLS OF FIRE on the street. One   of the ""balls"" remains whole until it smacks against the   feet of a Walker. Then it opens. And the Walker is engulfed   in flames."
kaufman, They can't get in. Downstairs. The car. The Dead Things POUND at the doors. One Guard runs away. The Other Three follow.
knipp," DON'T SHOOT!  Boss? Don't you shoot, neither. We're all on the same  S  side. Least we're supposed to be."

nipp, Boss. We gotta get outa here!
harlie,  RILEY!
iley, We gotta blow the fences!
riley," Yeah, but they're capped! The barrels of the two fourteen-inchers are still capped. DEAD RECKONING keeps rolling. RILEY climbs out onto one of the cannon barrels."
iley, Number One is clear! I'm going for Number Two!
nipp,  We eed gas.
aufman, Shoot it! Shoot the damn thing!
knipp," You didn't gimme no gun, sir."
