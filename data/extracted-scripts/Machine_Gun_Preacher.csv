sam,I'll only be gone a few weeks. Be back before you know it.
sam,You Ugandan Army or what?
deng,SPLA.
sam,What's that?
deng,Sudanese People's Liberation Army. We are freedom fighters.
sam,Name's Sam Childers.
deng,I am Deng.
sam, Givin ya problems?
deng,Yes. A bit.
sam,Double-feed?
deng,Sometimes.
sam,Lemme have a look...
deng,Thank you.
sam,No problem.
deng,Are you military?
sam,"No, not me. I ain't the military type. Ain't so good with bein told what to do."
deng,When did you learn about weapons?
sam,Long time ago. Different life.
dan,Some of us are going into Kampala tomorrow night. Find ourselves a little fun this weekend. You in?
sam,I was thinkin bout goin up north.
dan,You crazy? There's a civil war going on up there.
sam,I know.
sam,"Hey, Deng, you wanna Coke?"
deng,Thank you.
sam,Got a question for ya.
deng,Yes?
sam,I wanna go into Sudan this weekend. Need someone to show me around. You interested?
deng,The others are going into Kampala. 29
sam,That ain't my speed no more. I wanna see some country.
deng,You want to see?
sam,They always drive this fast?
deng,Traveling is the most dangerous time in Sudan. If the rebels find you on the open road it would be very bad.
sam,"You got kids, Deng?"
deng,No. I have no children.
sam,Where you from?
deng,A little village called Aweil. Many hours from here.
sam,That's where your family is?
deng,My family was killed by LRA.  Unyama is about two hours from here. We will stop there for lunch. 30
deng,The Muslim North has tried to kill the Christian South for 30 years. Two million have lost their lives...
deng,"Cholera and Malaria are everywhere, there is little food and not enough UN soldiers to protect everyone. Even here they worry the LRA will attack at night."
deng, Yes.
deng,"I'm sorry, Sam... I'll be five minutes."
sam,"Course, do what you gotta do."
agnete,Excuse me. You. Can you help please?
sam,What happened to her face?
agnete,The rebels cut off her lips because she argued. These are Kony's orders.
sam,Who's Kony?
agnete,Who are you with?
sam,I'm with Deng over there. 32
agnete,What organization are you with?
sam,"Working with a Christian group down South. Just up here takin a look around, seein a bit of the country."
agnete,"This isn't a tourist destination, this is a war zone. You stay in this area, you'll be killed.  Thank you for your help."
deng,Some say Joseph Kony is a wizard. A shapeshifter. He calls himself a Christian...
sam,Kony is the leader of the LRA?
deng,"He is the one we have been fighting for years. But there is very little we can do. Our weapons are old, and our boots are full of holes. We have been forgotten by the rest of the world."
sam,S'cuse me?
deng,What are you looking for in this place?
sam,Ain't lookin for nuthin.
deng,And then you will get your picture and go back to your life and all this will just be a story you tell your friends.
deng,They are night commuters. They come from deep in the bush. Their parents send them out because it is safer to sleep here than in their own homes.
sam,Why?
deng,Because death comes at night in the villages and refugee camps.
deng, Sam...
sam,Get up... let's go...
deng,What are you doing?
sam,They ain't sleepin out here. Tell em they're comin inside.  Ya'll get up... let's go...
deng,"Sam, there are too many..."
sam,I can help these here. 35
deng, Settle down... it's alright... you can sleep here till morning...
deng,The LRA attacked a village last night.
paige,You see any tigers over there?
sam,"Naw, didn't see no tigers."
paige,But they do have them over in Africa.
sam,"So I hear, but not where I was."
paige,Sure am glad you're home.
sam,"Me too, bug."
paige,I'm thinkin of a plane...
sam,"It's late, you better get to bed..."
paige,"C'mon, plane... I'm thinkin of a plane..."
sam,"You said plane, I'm thinkin of a train..."
paige,"You said train, I'm thinkin of a brain."
sam,"You said brain, I'm thinkin of a... "
paige,Gotcha!
sam,"Ok, you got me."
paige,"You coulda said drain, or mane... like horse's hair."
sam,"Sweet dreams, bug."
lynn,You comin to bed?
sam,In a bit
lynn,You ok?
sam,Just a long flight.
lynn,"Baby, whatcha doin?"
sam,Makin plans.
lynn,You been to bed yet?
sam,"I had a vision last night, Lynn. Crazy as it sounds, God spoke to me..."
lynn,A church? 40
sam,"Right across the street. Not like Faith United or Calvary Fellowship. Place that ain't gonna turn you away if you a drug addict or a prostitute or whatever. Place for sinners, just like me, who wanna hear the word of God."
lynn,"How we gonna pay for a church, Sam?"
sam,"We got money in the bank. Business is good. Besides, I own a construction company...  I'm gonna give us one heck of a good deal on the build."
lynn,Yer crazy.
sam,`Lil bit.
lynn,What's that?
sam,That's the orphanage I wanna build. In Sudan.
sam,That's me.
biker,"Hey bro, Ben Hobbes, knew each other long time ago."

daughter,"Daddy, I'm gonna go."
biker,"OK, sweetie..."
sam,Sure do.
biker,"Hey, nuthin fer nuthin, Sam, but rumor has it you was puttin up a chapel over there in Central City."
sam,That's right. Gonna minister to anybody who's lookin for The Lord.
biker,"That's good, man. Maybe you can do somethin bout your old friend, Donnie."
sam,What about em?
biker,"He ain't doin so good, bro. But hey, good seein ya' man. 42"
sam,I'm here for that boy right there. You gonna get in the way a that?
donnie,I can't do this.
sam,"Look at me. God don't make trash, boy. Now he ain't givin up on you, so don't give up on him, you hear me?"
donnie,Welcome to Shekinah Fellowship Church.
lynn,It's five-til and he still ain't here.
sam,You call him?  Try him again.
daisy,"You like this dress, Sam?"
sam,"What, mom? 44"
daisy,You ain't never seen this one. I bought it a long time ago. Been keepin it for a special occasion.
sam,It's nice.
daisy,"I never told you this but when I was pregnant with you, now this was way back, probably 1960, when yer daddy and I was still in Grand Rapids, a Pastor prophesied over me. Pulled me right up on stage and laid his hands on my belly and told me I was gonna have a Preacher for a son.  Yer daddy and I were so proud. I remember we went home and neither of us could sleep all night. Just laid there and talked bout you, bout what was comin."
sam,I just built a church. I ain't no preacher.
daisy,Yes you are. You were born to it. Just took you a little ways to get here.
sam," Thank you, Tommy. You boys is soundin pretty good up here."
sam,Be back soon as I can.
paige,You're gonna miss my play.
sam,"Have momma videotape it for me, k? Now I gotta git."
lynn,Call us when you can.
sam,I will.
donnie,"That's done, buddy."
deng,You came all this way to bring us new boots?
sam,"Right here, stop the truck!"
deng,"Sam, wait..."
sam,This is it...
administrator,This is not a good idea.
sam,I think it's a heckuva good idea.
administrator,It would be better further south. Closer to Kampala.
sam,"If I wanted to be closer to Kampala, I'd be closer to Kampala. I wanna be right here..."
administrator, He should not be this far north.
sam,What are you sayin?
administrator,"The villages in this area are very remote, Mr. Childers. There is nothing there."
sam,Then it seems to me them people need help the most.
administrator, He will be killed.
sam,Talk to me.
administrator,"This is in the war zone, Mr. Childers. The LRA will kill you here."
sam,"I don't think you understand me, so lemme make it real clear to ya. I didn't pick this land -- God did."
deng, Sam... this is Betty. She is from the village of Kotido. A few miles from here. 49
sam,Good to meet you Betty.
deng,She is knowing that you need someone to run the orphanage.
sam,I'm lookin for somebody who can keep the place in order. Make sure things is taken care of when I'm away.
deng,She can do this.
sam,"She's gonna have to take care of the children too, make sure they're fed, fix em when they're sick. Can she do that?"
betty, Quiet now.
sam,Tell her she's hired.
betty, You two share a blanket and tomorrow we will find another.
rose," Shhhh, it's time to shut your eyes..."
sam,"You know what's funny? In English your name means ""darn it."""
deng,What is this `darn it?'
sam,"Deng. It means `shucks.' You know, like you stub your toe and you go ""ahhhhh, deng!"" Get it?"
deng, Your name proceeds you wherever you go. You are Sam. This is how you are known. In my language this means something.
sam,"I'm sorry, buddy. It was just a joke."
deng,Small penis.
sam,Can I ask you a question?
deng,Of course.
sam,You believe in God?
deng,"I was raised to believe there was a God in heaven.  But it is impossible to live here, to see what I have seen, and not turn your back on him."
sam,Maybe you'll invite him in again one day.
deng,I don't think so.
sam,How many are there?
deng,Two squads...  There -- and there.
sam,Where are your men?
deng,I don't know.
sam,They're gonna pick us off like this!
betty, Stay down! -- stay down! --
rose,We are protected! --
sam,-- Betty! Get em to the church right now!  Understand?! --
sam,Get yer men back to the church! That's our best shot! I'll cover you...
deng, To the church! --
sam, Put em in the middle!
betty, Down here! -- in the center! -- all of you! -- stay down!
deng, Four on the right!
nineteen, There are too many!
sam,Just keep firin!

lynn,Then quit feelin sorry for yerself. Them children have had their whole lives burned to the ground and worse. How many of them you see givin up?
sam,Cut it all down... so they got nowhere to hide...
deng, All the way around...
sam,Come on in...
deng,"Preacher, you need to come see this."
sam,What's goin on?
deng,The Acholi people were farmers before they were driven from their ancestral homeland. Each year they blessed the soil before a planting.
betty, The children are your fields...
deng, ... she says you are a farmer and these children are your crops... 59
betty, ... and this ground will grow them tall.
deng,... and this ground is richer now and they will grow stronger because of it.
sam,What is she saying?
betty,She is asking what she did wrong?
sam, Tell her she's gonna be ok.
sam,Where did they find em?
deng,Their village was hit out Adjumani.
deng,Sam...

sam,Adjumani.
deng,"Sam, please wait..."
sam,I ain't waitin. You wanna see what waitin gets ya? Take a look in that buildin over there...

sam,"Mornin, buddy."
deng, Looks like you've got yourself a bodyguard.
sam,Guess I do.
deng,"I will, Preacher."
sam,"You can't come with me, buddy."
deng, Get out of there.
sam,... he's not interested in your good thoughts... your good intentions... he wants your hands... your backs... your sweat... your blood to pour into the foundation that will build up his kingdom!
lynn,"We started daycare last month. Monday thru Friday from 8 to 2... Sundays after first worship for a few hours if anybody needs it. How you doin, Sue?"
volunteer,Good. Hey Pastor.
sam,Sue.
lynn,We can't build anymore. Not for awhile.
sam,You said Sundays has been full.
lynn,"Turn outs been good, but that don't mean people is givin money.  Economy is in trouble, construction business is slow. Times is tight."
sam,"Be good for them kids, Lynn."
lynn,They got the playground over in Cairnbrook. And they can play at the school on weekends if they want
sam,Not talking bout here. Talkin about the orphange.
donnie,"What'cha workin on, buddy?"
sam,Trouble with the push rods I think. She's runnin kinda rough.
donnie,Shoulda kept that mild in there `stead a buildin up a hot rod. Let's see whatcha got here...
sam,Used to fix them old shovelheads on the side of the road with a buckknife and a wire hanger.
donnie,Remember that year we went to the Freakers Ball?
sam,I think that old `78 broke down five times on that trip. 69
donnie,"Sounds about right. Shoot, we had more fun tryin to get there than when we finally did."
sam,Yep.
donnie,"I'm glad I'm walkin with the Lord and all, but sometimes I ain't sure I'm gonna be able to do what he wants me to do."
sam,"The Lord don't ask for nuthin you can't deliver, buddy. And yer one tough ole boy."
donnie,Sometimes I ain't so sure how tough I am.
sam,Why don't we pray together then...
bill,"... from what I heard, you built yourself one helluva church over there in Central City. 70"
sam,"Still got a ways to go, but we're gettin there. You should come on by one of these Sundays, bring the family."
bill,"That's nice of you, but we're at Calvary now. Bit more our speed over there I think."
sam,"Reverand Carlton gives a mean sermon, puts me to shame. Anyway Bill, I'm here cause I wanna talk to you about what we're doin over there in Africa."
bill,"Course I know about what you're doin. Helluva thing helpin out those kids, Sam."
sam,"Thank you, but I'm gonna be straight with ya. We're hurtin for money... If we had a little bit more support from people like yourself sure would help things run a lot smoother over there."
bill,"Sam, look, everybody is feelin the pinch around here."
sam,"I hear that, but you gotta understand that them kids over there got nuthin. I mean nuthin, Bill, and I'm not asking for much."
bill,How much you lookin for?
sam,Five thousand dollars.
bill,"Jesus Christ, Sam! Five thousand dollars?"
sam,That keeps them doors open for another six months. 71
bill,People are losin their jobs left and right round here. Tough to be askin for five thousand dollars for a buncha African children half-way around the world.
sam,"You're right. We got problems right here. But with that kinda money we could feed them kids, house them kids."
bill,"Alright, tell you what, lemme see what I can do."
sam,Ok.
bill,"Why don't you and the family come over to the house next Sunday. We're havin a little barbeque, ok?"
sam,Sounds good.
shannon,"Well, come on in..."
lynn,"I'm Lynn, this here is Sam, our daughter Paige."
shannon,Good to meet you.
bill,Glad ya'll could make it. Get on in here and meet some people...
sam,"Thank you, Bill."
bill,"Forget it. Now c'mon, can I get ya a mojito or somethin?"
lynn,Sam... 73
paige,Why we leavin so soon?
shannon,Everything alright?...
sam,Get in the car.
lynn,What's wrong?
sam,Sonuvabitch is cryin pour-mouth to me and he's livin in the damn Taj Mahal...
lynn,Sam...
sam,I asked him for five-thousand dollars to feed a buncha motherless babies and you know what he gave me?  Hundred and fifty bucks. That's it. Handed it to me like it was gold bouillon! Sonuvabitch spent more than that on salsa for his party.
lynn,What are you doin?
sam,I've had it with these people and all their bullshit about wantin to help...
lynn,Sam Childers... 74
sam,Stay outta my way.
shop owner,"... I'm sorry, twenty-five hundred is the best I can do for them gun."
sam,Throw in the car for five.
nineteen, It's Garang! -- It's Garang! --
sam,Who's this guy?
deng,That's our leader.
sam,John Garang?
garang,They call you Preacher. Is this what I should call you?
sam,Sam is fine.
garang,I hear what you have done for the SPLA and I am grateful.
sam,We can thank God for his blessins.
garang,"Yes, we can. How many children do you look after, Sam?"
sam,Couple hundred with us here. Feed another thousand a day from nearby villages. Anyone who shows up hungry gets a meal.
garang,"What you are doing is noble, but too dangerous. I must advise you to stop risking your life in our struggle. 76"
sam,"Until someone starts fightin for these children, I'm the one that's gonna do it."
garang,"You are stubborn, aren't you?"
sam,As a mule.
garang,"You and I come from very different worlds, but we are not so dissimilar."
sam,Talkin bout peace in a room somewhere is a waste of time. You gotta go out and make it.
garang,"You are correct, but we must fight them at every level. Part of my battle is waged in those rooms. We must talk of peace, but keep our rifles ready for war."
donnie,You say prayers or somethin?
paige,Already did.
donnie,"Ok then, sweet dreams."
paige,Ain't you gonna read me a book?
donnie,"Ahh, Paige, you know I don't read so good."
paige,Then let's play a game.
donnie,Ok.
paige,I'm thinkin of a dog.
donnie,What about it?
paige,"Never mind, Donnie."
donnie,Ok. 78

deng,Some of the child soldiers say there is a bounty on your life. That Kony is offering money for your nose and ears.

sam,... Open yer eyes!... Wake up!...  But God don't want sheep. He wants wolves to fight his fight. Men and women with teeth to tear at the evil that's out there...
sam,... WHO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STICK AND A SWORD AND AIN'T AFRAID TO PICK UP EITHER IF THEY NEED TO!...
sam,... DRAWING UP BATTLE LINES AGAINST HIS ENEMY WHEREVER THEY MAY BE...
sam,... UNTIL THE LEGIONS AGAINST THEM FALL AND ONCE AGAIN THERE IS ONLY HIS LIGHT...
