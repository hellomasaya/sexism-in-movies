NAOMI Judy Baumer is going as a twirler. RUTH But she's so fat.     I'd go as Cinderella... or Peter Pan. NAOMI Peter Pan's a boy. Tinker Bell's a girl. Phillip could go as Peter Pan... 'cept you gotta' fly.

In the near window, Ruth and Naomi steal a look through the window. GLADYS We're Jehovah's Witness. Superman locks eyes with Phillip. SUPERMAN Hey, Phillip Perry."
phillip,"Hey, Billy Reeves. SUPERMAN How'd ya' know it was me? GLADYS Go eat your supper, Phillip. MR. HUGHES Come on, kids. Let's go to the next house. Sorry for the bother. Gladys closes the door firmly and locks it. 6   EXT. HUNTSVILLE STATE PRISON - NIGHT                        6 A green Impala pulls up to the main entrance and stops. A GUARD steps from his office to greet the driver, LARRY, a pudgy 55-year-old prison employee wearing a loud plaid jacket."
guard,"Evenin', Larry.   Forget somethin'? LARRY Goin' to Austin tomorrow.      Gonna' take some work with me. GUARD Work, work, work. When you and me gonna' go out and grab a cold one? LARRY Sooner the better. The gate opens and the Impala passes."
4.,"7   INT. CELL - NIGHT                                         7 BUTCH HAYNES, a 38-year-old inmate who reeks with knowledge procured from the wrong side of the tracks, but whose sad, tired eyes bemoan a maximum of regret, stands on the top of a cell bunk chipping at the ceiling. JERRY PUGH, 29, rail thin, a punk who constantly licks his lips, keeps watch at the door. An OLD TIMER sits on his bunk and watches both with a cautious eye. Butch chips through to something. BUTCH Damn if the old man ain't right. Jerry smiles, turns and grabs the old man by the shirt."
jerry,"And this goes to the roof? OLD TIMER Used to... afore they walled it over. JERRY If it don't I'm gonna' rip your tongue out. OLD TIMER Get yer' damn hands off me! Jerry laughs and joins Butch, who is already well on his way to bending open a slot in a corrugated metal air shaft hidden behind the wall. 8   EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT                                      8 Superman and Dancing Skeleton, no longer with adult super- vision, fill water balloons at an outdoor water spigot."
superman,"Make 'em small so you can heave 'em. 9   INT. PERRY HOUSE - NIGHT                                       9 An assembly line at the kitchen sink as the twins wash and Phillip dries the evening dishes. Gladys sits at the kitchen table, reading religious pamphlets and keeping a watchful eye over the process. Several THUDS resound through the house. PHYLLIS What in the world? Phillip jumps down off his stool and races into the living room."
5.,"10    EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                          10 Superman lofts a BALLOON and grabs another as the first hits the door of the Perry house and SPLATTERS. SUPERMAN Bombs away! Dancing Skeleton does his best Warren Spahn and tosses a wet fastball at the door. SKELETON Here's your trick! At the window, Phillip, his nose pressed to the pane, stares expressionless at the onslaught. He barely flinches as a BALLOON SPLATS only inches away. Gladys arrives and pulls the curtains shut once more. 11A   EXT. PRISON - NIGHT                                         11A Butch kicks the top off a ventilator shaft and rolls onto the roof. Jerry follows as Butch shimmies to the wall. At the edge, Butch and Jerry survey the yard as a searchlight routinely bathes the walls in a circle of light. 11B   THEIR POV - GREEN IMPALA                                    11B parked almost directly below them, next to the Administration office of the prison. JERRY You'n'me must be livin' right, Butchie boy! BUTCH Let's get something straight. I don't like you. As soon as we're on our way, that's it. JERRY Who said I liked you? Butch slides down and hangs from the ledge before dropping on the roof of the building below. 12    INT. ADMIN OFFICE - NIGHT                                   12 A SOFT THUD causes a Guard to look up, but only momentarily as he spots Larry departing, files in hand, waving goodbye. GUARD Have a safe trip now, Larry."
6.,"13    EXT. YARD - NIGHT                                          13 Just as Larry reaches the Impala, Butch and Jerry leap down and land on him. The spotlight showers them in a flash of light as it passes by. Butch cups his hand over Larry's mouth while Jerry reaches into his jacket -- Bingo -- a shiny .38. BUTCH  Gawd I'd love to blow yer' head off."
7.,"16A   CONTINUED:                                                     16A MAE Same pie as yesterday. Not much call for rhubarb. Sell one slice a day. In the background we hear a SIREN. Red turns and watches a police patrol car whiz past, lights on. MAE Yer off duty. Tell me, if I stopped bakin' 'em would you still come by every night? Red, preoccupied, takes another rubbery bite. RED I don't know."
8.,"16C   CONTINUED:                                                    16C They walk. Red arrives at a truck with a 10 gallon coffee urn roped to the tailgate. He grabs a paper cup and pours. SERGEANT Guy holdin' his family hostage. She kicked him out, served him divorce papers, he came back drunk and pulled a .38. Fired two shots but we don't think anybody's hit. Actually you might know the guy from your sheriff days. Hayden Webb. Been on suspension for awhile. Ring any bells? RED Yeah.   Lemme talk to him."
sergeant,"No can do.   Police jurisdiction. Red tastes the coffee -- cold. He spits it out, pours the contents of the cup on the ground and walks toward the front yard. Sergeant follows. RED And how are you guys doin'? SERGEANT We got specific rules to follow in these kinda situations, Red.  He won't talk. Jus' keeps yellin', crying and waving his gun around. Red moves forward into the yard. SERGEANT At least use the megaphone, you stubborn jackass! But Red ignores and arrives at the front door.   He knocks. RED Hayden, this is Red Garnett. We worked together a few years back. Mind if I come in? The YELLING inside STOPS and the door opens a crack.   HAYDEN, 35, distraught, peers out. HAYDEN 'Evenin', Chief. RED Leave it to the P.D. They got a three- ring circus out there and not one cup of hot coffee. You mind? Hayden mulls it over, then opens the door."
9.,"16D   INT. WEBB HOUSE - NIGHT                                        16D On the couch sits Hayden's wife, JULIE, cradling her two kids, an infant and an 8-year-old boy. Julie sobs. Her eye and temple are bruised purple. Red slowly enters, nods to Julie, takes off his hat and sets it on a lampstand. Hayden has moved away from Red against the wall. He holds the gun out at no one in particular. HAYDEN Julie, put a pot of coffee on. She slowly gets up and moves to the kitchen, still weeping. RED Appreciate it.   Jus' what is it you want, Hayden? HAYDEN I dunno... I want my job.    I want my family. RED What'd they suspend you for? HAYDEN I answer a call in South Austin. Girl gettin' raped, that's the word. I bust in the door, this lowlife is beatin' the shit outta her with a tire iron. 'Help me, help me,' she says. I take the guy down. He bites me. I break his arm. Case closed, right? No. She was his wife and they both sue me and the department. The guy's about to kill her and she sues me 'cause now he can't pump gas. They have chump change in the bank but they got the best lawyer in town. Three months I'm goin' crazy. No pay. Then my wife leaves me and I get served divorce papers by John Reese -- a sheriff's man. You know how embarrassin' that is? What's happenin', Chief? I mean, everybody's got a fuckin' lawyer! Julie emerges from the kitchen and retakes her seat. RED You love her?    Love the kids? HAYDEN Yeah. JULIE Then why do you hit me! Hayden grips the quivering revolver tight and points it at her. Red calms the situation... "
10.,"16D   CONTINUED:                                                        16D RED You don't wanna shoot her. HAYDEN I swear to God I think I do. RED Naw, Hayden, I don't     think so. I think you love her. You know      what else I think? That you'd like a way out     of this whole mess... That's where I come     in. 16E   EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                                16E Sergeant and other cops stand around and watch the house."
sergeant,"Well, I'll be damned. NEW ANGLE The front door opens and Julie emerges with her two kids. She takes a few cautious steps, then runs to the police. 16F   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                                16F Red sits on the coffee table, unloading Hayden's gun.       He opens the cylinder and drops the shells to the floor. A calmer Hayden exits the kitchen with Red's coffee.       Red accepts it, takes a sip. RED Hits the spot. Hayden starts to sob a bit.      Red hands over a handkerchief which Hayden accepts. HAYDEN No cuffs, huh, Chief? RED Okay.   You ready? Hayden nods, they stand. Red picks up his hat, sticks it on his head, opens the door and holds it for... Hayden, transfixed by the multitude of lights outside.      He gulps. RED We'll walk out together, okay? Hayden steps back, looks at Red, then reaches behind his back, underneath his shirt and pulls out a .22 pistol. "
11.,"16F   CONTINUED:                                                      16F HAYDEN Any good officer has a back-up. Red holds his palms out and takes a step toward Hayden. RED Lemme have it, Hayden. Hayden points the gun at Red, freezing him. HAYDEN Was I a good officer, Chief? Red nods."
hayden,"Was I a good deputy? The kinda man you could depend on to do what's right? RED Yeah. Hayden smiles. HAYDEN Thank you. Then he turns the GUN on himself, swallows the barrel and BLOWS his brains out. DISSOLVE TO: 16G   EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                 16G Hayden's dead, covered body is carried out the door.    Julie screams and sobs, still holding her crying children."
12.,"17   CONTINUED:                                                     17 Jerry skims through a girly magazine, turning the pages with the gun. Butch, wearing Larry's plaid jacket, jimmies open the cash register. He looks to the floor then to... Jerry, who catches Butch's gaze, holds it, looks down at the floor, then, smiling, looks back to Butch. He returns to the skin mag. Butch holds his stare at Jerry then, in one move, grabs a wad of cash and hops over the counter and out of the store. Jerry notices Butch leaving, grabs a handful of assorted Brach's candies and hurries after."
jerry,"Hey, wait up! Jerry's feet scurry through a pool of blood and past a quivering hand. 18   INT. D.P.S. - TEXAS RANGERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT               18 It's very late, after midnight, and only a handful of people, half of whom are cleanup crews, shuffle through the offices. A light from an office at the end of the hall catches our eye. A MUFFLED  VOICE over the phone... RED                     20 The CLANGING wind up alarm CLOCK reads 5:30 and Gladys opens her eyes and gently quiets it with a touch. She groans and rises, not happy but used to the daily ritual required of her."
13.,"21   INT. PERRY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                 21 As the kitchen light comes on we see that the couch has been opened up to a bed in which all three children sleep. The twins sleep soundly but Phillip tosses and turns away from the light. 22   EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT                                      22 The Impala creeps through the previously seen neighborhood without its lights. 23   INT. IMPALA - NIGHT                                            23 Butch drives while Jerry scours the block. JERRY There's a Buick. BUTCH Don't want a Buick. Want a Ford. JERRY Ford's leak oil.     A car's a car. Butch puts on the brakes and brings the car to a stop. BUTCH Then take the Buick. JERRY Soon as we cross state line I'll do just that.  I'm tired of riding around. I'll check down the block... for a Ford! Jerry gets out, slams the door, lights a cigarette and walks away. Butch waits a few seconds, quietly turns the key one notch and checks the gas ggauge. It reads almost empty. He taps it with his finger but it doesn't budge. He sighs, looks up and sees... JERRY as he checks one locked car, then feeling eyes on his back, turns, looks at Butch, grins and disappears around a corner. BUTCH discreetly exits the car himself, carefully closing the door without a sound. 24   INT. PERRY KITCHEN - NIGHT                               24 Gladys steps into a slip and snaps her bra while cracking eggs into a skillet. By rote she salts, stirs, and pops bread into the toaster."
14.,"25    EXT. PERRY BACKYARD - SOMEONE'S POV - NIGHT                  25 FROM BEHIND a fence, THROUGH the opened, screened windows we see Gladys at work. Phillip enters, dressed in cotton briefs and a T-shirt, drags a chair from the kitchen table by the window and assists his mother by buttering the toast. POV MOVES CLOSER. GLADYS Thank you, Phillip. Go wake up your sisters. Phillip dutifully steps down and returns to the living room. Gladys works to adjust her slip, then grabs plates and silverware and takes them to the table."
jerry,"I take mine fried. 26    INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                         26 Gladys gasps at Jerry's face pressed against the screen, but controls herself when he brandishes the pistol. He motions for her to open the back door. She does. He slides into the room and sits down at the table. 27    EXT. ON STREET - NIGHT                                       27 A Ford sits in a driveway. In the far b.g. a back porch light glares. Butch ENTERS FRAME, looks at the light, turns to the Ford and starts to jimmie the lock. No luck. He rises and looks to the light. 28    INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                         28 Jerry stuffs a piece of toast in his mouth, grins at Gladys and makes a motion to the counter. JERRY A lil' on the bland side.   Gimme' that ketchup. She picks up a bottle of Heinz and inches toward him. When she gets close, he grabs her and forces her onto his lap. He holds the gun to her throat and whispers in her ear. JERRY Don't got a man around here, do ya'? 29A   INT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                29A MR. CUMMINGS, 70, puts on his glasses and peers through the window."
15.,"29B   HIS POV - PERRY KITCHEN                                        29B Gladys sits on Jerry's lap, thanks to .38 caliber coercion. The convict's hands move freely over the frightened woman's body. 30    INT. PERRY KITCHEN - NIGHT                               30 JERRY Feed me, sweet thing. Her shaking hands raise a forkful of eggs to his lips.    He licks them once then gobbles with gusto. Phillip enters the room and stops dead in his tracks. JERRY Well lookie here, you do got a man! Jerry smiles at Phillip while he kisses and licks Glady's neck. At once, Phillip darts across the room at Jerry, who backhands the boy with his gunhand, sending Phillip sprawling. Butch blasts through the door in an instant. With a swift kick to the head, Jerry is knocked senseless onto the floor against the cabinets. The gun slides across the floor and lands at Phillip's feet. JERRY  I'm bleedin'! You happy? Butch gives Jerry an icy stare and kneels down to eye level with Phillip. Butch looks at the gun and then at Phillip. BUTCH What's your name, boy?"
16.,"30   CONTINUED:                                                    30 Phillip reaches down and slowly picks up the gun by the handle. He takes one step toward Butch, then another. Gladys, petrified, sobs. Phillip arrives armslength from Butch. CLOSEUPS - PHILLIP AND BUTCH BUTCH Now say 'stick 'em up.' PHILLIP  Stick 'em up..."
17.,"30   CONTINUED:     I vote we bring her with us. BUTCH No. JERRY How we gonna' get outta' here without a hostage, tell me that? The whole goddam neighborhood's awake. BUTCH We'll take the boy. Silence.   Gladys can't believe her ears.   Then... GLADYS Nooooo!!! Jerry tosses Gladys aside. She collapses onto the floor. The TWINS instantly start to CRY. Phillip winds up and hits Butch as hard as he can. Butch picks him up, directs Cummings into the kitchen with the gun and nods for Jerry to lead. BUTCH You'll get him back. I swear it."
18.,"32   INT. CAR - DAWN                                                 32 Jerry FIRES a SHOT over their heads, sending them to the deck or scurrying for safety. JERRY Ain't you folks ever heard of sleepin' in?!! 33   EXT. PERRY YARD - DAWN                                          33 Cummings races from behind the house with the SHOTGUN, levels it and FIRES a BLAST... A nearby station wagon WINDOW SHATTERS. Rising from their cover position, its owners look at Cummings with disgust."
owner,"Nice shootin', Fred. 34   INT. RED'S OFFICE - DAY                                         34 Garnett, still in the same clothes, rests the phone receiver in his ear while he shuffles through the files before him. Red's deputy and boy friday, TOM ADLER, 40, lank, thinning hair, with a face as soft as Red's is hard, warms up Red's coffee with a jolt from the Chief's favorite plaid Thermos. RED "
19.,"34   CONTINUED:                                                        34 RED keeps staring at the photo, oblivious to the phone conversa- tion he's ""not having"". PHONE VOICE  Huh?"
20.,34   CONTINUED:    Penny Munroe. SALLY I believe you have me confused. I'm here from Huntsville. Assigned by Governor Connally. Red is confused.     He turns a blank expression to Adler.
red,"Adler...    what is this? Adler searches the messy desk for something. ADLER Rings a bell, Red. Believ' they sent us something about her this mornin'... RED Who sent?... ADLER ... Guvner', Red. Adler finds the telex message sheet he's looking for and hands it to Red. "
21.,"34   CONTINUED:    Uh, I'm Sally Gerber. Criminologist with the State Prison System. Sally offers her hand. Red, perusing the telex, ignores but Adler shakes somewhat reluctantly, not sure if he's supposed to like her or not. ADLER Tom Adler.   Deputy. State Police... System."
sally,"It's a relatively new procedure but I was assigned by Governor Connally... RED  On our way, Marge."

This mornin' another hostage was taken... from a private home in Madisonville. A boy, age 8. Grabbed him out of bed. REPORTER #1 Any sex offenses on Haynes or Pugh? RED Yer' askin' if they're preverts.   Well, one is. REPORTER #4 You got inter-agency cooperation on this? RED Texas Rangers as the criminal investigation arm of the D.P.S. share responsibility with the F.B.I. due to the kid being taken. But I doubt they're out of bed yet. A few chuckles."

RED That's all I've got but I'd like to introduce ya' to Miss Sally Gerber. She's straight from the Governor's office. Knows all about psychological profiles and the like. You probably have some questions for her. Red steps back and to one side. Sally is taken aback but then warms to the idea and steps to the podium for her first press conference, ready to take on the tough questions, to show off a bit, but...."
reporter,"Yes I do. Sally smiles a bit then puts on her serious face awaiting... REPORTER You doin' anything tonight? Sally, steamed, glares at the guy and stomps out of the room. REPORTER I'm serious! 36   INT. IMPALA - DAY                                         36 Butch is driving with Phillip in the front seat beside him, still in his underwear.

SAUNDERS Latest technology, oversized engine, complete kitchen and sleeping quarters, gun racks, frig, stove, the works. Even got a hot line phone straight to the Governor's office. Red stops circling and nods to Adler, who scurries away. RED Fine piece of machinery."
saunders,"What's more, as soon as it gets back from Dallas it will be at your requisitioned disposal. Perfect for lots of situations -- a headquarters on wheels. Red smiles, walks up to one of the Lone Star decals and rips it off. RED We'll take it. SAUNDERS Uh, Chief?.... Red rips off another decal. Adler and a few others start to load equipment, guns and files into the motor home. In addition they cart out unecessary items: mattresses, etc. and stack them in a pile outside the motor home.

Sally arrives but before she can spit out a word... RED Tell John that Miss Gerber here checked me out on it. Red whistles and the ENGINE REVS. Red closes the door as the motor home pulls away. Saunders runs beside the passenger side window and yells in to Suttle, who stares out the window. SAUNDERS Not a scratch, you hear me, Suttle? Not a scratch! Saunders stops, breathing hard, next to Sally.   She's pissed and overloaded with files. AIRSTREAM about 20 yards down the way, comes to a stop.    A second later the door opens and the steps pop out. Sally walks toward the bus but when she arrives at the door... ... LAUGHTER filters out of the Airstream.

AIRSTREAM - DAY                                             42 Sally enters, balancing the   boxes, and glares at the faces surrounding her. A smiling    Red, a grinning Adler messily gorging on a cinnamon roll,   a nervous KAISER, the radio man, and, in the corner, a nasty   smirk from Bobby Lee. When the Airstream takes off again, she loses her balance and drops one of the boxes. Adler and Suttle jump forward to help but she gives them the evil eye. SALLY I've got it. She kneels down to pick it up and feels eyes on her.     She looks up to the men staring at... Her skirt, raised a bit, exposing a thigh.

It slows, however, before the main part of town and slides to a stop near a pay phone booth. 44   INT./EXT. IMPALA - DAY                                           44 JERRY Why the hell we stoppin'? BUTCH You said you had a cousin near here. JERRY So? BUTCH So give him a call. See if we can shack there til' things cool down. Jerry thinks it over, leans forward and, in one quick swipe, grabs the keys from the ignition. Then he laughs and crawls out on his way to the phone booth. "

Blood spurts from Jerry's nose and the injured man cups his hands over the wound. Butch spins and retakes the wheel from a frightened Phillip. BUTCH ... And that's a fact. Instead of expressing outrage, Jerry slinks back down in the seat wearing a look of pure hatred. JERRY I'm gonna' kill you for that."

BUTCH How-do.    Where's yer' sodees? MAN Hot in the first aisle.       Cold in the back, in the cooler. 48   INT. IMPALA - DAY                                      48 Phillip's slightly shaking hands hold the pistol pointed directly at Jerry's head. JERRY You ever shot a gun before, boy? No answer. Phillip steals a glance at the store, anxious for Butch to return. JERRY Powww!!!...    It'll knock you on your ass. PHILLIP Be quiet, mister. JERRY Naw. You ain't never shot no gun before. Livin' in a house with three split tails... no Daddy around. You'll prolly' grow up queer, you know that? A bead of sweat rolls down Phillip's cheek. JERRY Now I'm gonna' lean up here real slow, okay? So we can talk. Jerry raises his hands, palms up and slowly leans forward in the back seat. Phillip's hand quivers but he doesn't pull the trigger. JERRY There we go. Now we can have a 'man to man.' You are a man, ain't ya'?"

Say does your mama sew yer' name in 'em, initials or anything? Jerry's hand slowly reaches down to the white briefs. He places one finger in the front elastic waistband and slowly pulls it open. JERRY Whatcha' got in there? Jerry sneaks a peek. JERRY Kinda' puny, ain't it? Phillip, diverted, looks down.    In a flash Jerry grabs the gun. JERRY The hand is quicker than the eye. Jerry flicks open the revolver, spins it -- empty slots. JERRY "

Butch reaches in his pocket and extracts the wad stolen from the convenience store. The Old Man takes note. Butch selects a five and places it on the counter. OLD MAN Land's sake.   What line of work you in? The Old Man bags the goods, but Butch takes the shells and puts them in his coat pocket. BUTCH Used cars. Buy 'em, fix 'em up. Sold a Cadillac down in Madisonville this mornin'. OLD MAN Don't say. 52   INT.

JERRY Come over a little closer. As Jerry    groans, Phillip seizes the moment and bites Jerry hard on    the ear. Jerry screams and drops the gun, which Phillip    picks up and carries with him as he scurries out of the car    and into the hay field. Jerry, in pain, now with both ears bleeding, crawls out of the back seat and gives chase."

In the b.g. we see Butch emerge from the field and walk toward the car. The Old Man, who also heard the shot, emerges from the store with a baseball bat.   Butch arrives at the car, spots the Old Man and levels the revolver at him. Phillip is relieved when he hears Butch's voice instead of Jerry's. BUTCH  You got a phone? OLD MAN Naw."
butch,"Then go inside and lie down til' we're gone. The Old Man meekly does so. Butch goes to the car door, opens it and motions to a frozen stiff Phillip. BUTCH Well... Get in. 57   EXT.

They won't be together long. Silence.   Sally continues. SALLY Haynes and Pugh are opposites. Haynes is a criminal's criminal -- armed robbery, mano y mano confrontation.

Arthur Godfrey says it keeps ya' young, but I'm not sure it's worth it. SALLY I'd like an answer. RED This yer' first time out of an office? She refuses to answer. RED Thought so.   What'd ya' expect ya' signed on for? Adler, Bobby Lee and Kaiser all watch the discussion, smiles on their faces. Sally abruptly closes the door. SALLY You think I'm what? Some dumb schoolgirl who wandered into the boy's locker room? Well you're wrong. I don't mean to boast, but I happen to be one of the two most intelligent people involved in this fiasco. RED Didn't ask that.    Asked what you expected. SALLY I expected to be allowed to do the job assigned to me by the Governor. RED I happen to like the Governor, hunt quail together every year. But deep down he and I know that win, lose or draw this is my ship, not his. SALLY The Governor as chief executive officer of this state bears ultimate responsibility for... RED ... Bullshit.

RED What do you think? SALLY Based on what's happened the past two days I don't think he would. RED One thing's for sure. If he gets outta' here with the boy, we're right back to where we started. BRADLEY If he kills the boy he'll get the chair. ADLER Shit, he'll get the chair anyway.   He's killed two in two days. SALLY We don't know that he pulled the trigger on either of the innocent victims. ADLER Well he wasn't at home in his Strat-O- Lounger. 'Sides, who killed Pugh? Casper? RED All right, both of you, that's enough! From the trail of blood I got a feelin' it ain't gonna' make any difference. Let's jus' concentrate on gettin' the boy out for now. Bobby Lee approaches with a leather case, bypasses Red and goes straight to Hendricks. BOBBY LEE Where ya' want me, sir? RED Can you shoot off a hood? Bobby Lee nods. In the b.g., a HELICOPTER circles, preparing to land. "

CREEKSIDE - DAY                                         204 Butch and Phillip watch the helicopter land. BUTCH See, Phillip, dreams do come true. There's yer' rocketship. PHILLIP Think I'll get to ride it? BUTCH Today's the day. RED  Butch, we got the boy's Mama here. She wants to say something. Phillip is visibly stunned by the news. He crawls up to the crest of the creekside and squints, looking for his mom. BUTCH What's wrong, Phillip? PHILLIP It's my mama. Phillip still cranes his neck to see."
butch,"Now that ya' got yerself a ghost suit, do ya' think she'll let ya' trick r' treat? PHILLIP "
131.,"205   CONTINUED:                                                    205 Inside is... a high-powered military rifle in three parts. Hands unzip a velvetine bag and pull out a high-powered scope. Bobby Lee holds the lens of the scope to his mouth, blows a breath on it and wipes it clean with a piece of clean cloth. He feels eyes and turns to see... Sally, watching him at work. Bobby Lee smiles at her, cocksure.   His dark role in this manhunt is now perfectly clear. Sally turns her head, disgusted."
132.,206   CONTINUED:                                                    206 PHILLIP  This one's shot.

BUTCH 'Bye, Phillip.    It's been one helluva' ride. Butch nods and smiles. BUTCH  All right, Cap'n. Make way for Casper the friendly ghost. The friendliest ghost I know. Butch nudges Phillip and the boy starts toward the field. 213   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                            213 Adler, looking through binoculars, can't help but smile. RED Gimme' them things. Adler hands over the binoculars.    Red takes a look. HIS POV - PHILLIP nee Casper, walking in his full whitehood, arms reaching for the sky."

FIELD - DAY                                             216 Phillip turns back and sees ... Butch -- He tries to get up in an attempt to make a run for it, but his strength is gone. He collapses. Phillip, standing still, with his mother's shrieks filling the air behind him, watches Butch for a second then runs back toward him. 217   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                          217 Red sighs and lowers the binocs. 218   EXT.

RED  Stay on ready. 220   EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY                                           220 Phillip holds his hand out and helps Butch get up. Butch stands, dusts himself off, grabs the boy's hand and to- gether they walk toward the field."
sally,He's giving himself up. HENDRICKS Keep in mind -- he still has the gun. RED 
139.,"224   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                               224 With all the yelling, it's hard to make out what's being said. Butch and Phillip continue to walk and talk. BUTCH So I guess that's it for Alaska, Phillip. 225   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                            225 RED Stop and put your hands on your head! GLADYS Run, Phillip!   Come here, Phillip! SALLY  You clean? BOBBY LEE As a whistle. RED Keep him locked down.    Don't squeeze til' I say 'when.' Red holds Bobby Lee's eyes until the young Fed nods.    Then Red unstraps his holster and moves between the cars."
hendricks,"Where the hell you going? But Red's not listening, just walking, long and tall, into the field. EXT. FIELD - DAY Butch and Phillip continue to walk, Butch holding Phillip's hand. When Butch spots Red approaching he slows and then stops. Red shows his palms and keeps walking toward them.     When he gets within 25 feet he stops. RED I'm unarmed.    Toss your gun on the ground.

Do I know you, friend? RED No... not really. BUTCH Hmm. Well, look I wanna' talk to the boy and then we'll take care of bidness. How's that? Only take a second. Red nods then looks over his shoulder at the patrol cars lined up like a wagon train, guns aimed, Bobby Lee peering through the scope of his rifle. 226   NEW ANGLE                                                    226 Butch and Phillip. BUTCH I wanna' give ya' somethin'. 227   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                          227 HENDRICKS He's stopped. ADLER He's gonna make a run for it."
sally,Give it a second! HENDRICKS  If he makes a move...
141.,"228   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                             228 Butch kneels down beside Phillip.    He reaches slowly, pain- fully for his back pocket. BUTCH Mebe' someday you'll get to go... 229   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                          229 Hendricks looks through the binocs. HENDRICKS He's goin' for his weapon! THROUGH BINOCULARS"
142.,"229   CONTINUED:                                                      229 BUTCH Damn, Buzz, shot twice in the same day. He collapses and falls into Phillip's arms. Phillip backs away two steps and falls to his knees. Butch wavers for a second then topples on his back. Phillip moans, sobs, as he watches Butch, the GUNSHOT still ECHOING. AT ROADSIDE Gladys runs from behind the car, followed by a host of officers."
hendricks,"Keep everybody back! Bobby Lee stands, lowers his rifle disengages and smiles at Hendricks. BOBBY LEE No need to worry.     He can't hurt nobody now. IN FIELD Red stands frozen, staring, in another world. An OFFICER trots up to Butch and does a careful ground frisk. OFFICER  No weapon, Chief! Red ""comes to,"" turns and walks toward the..."
roadside,"Red walks   up to Bobby Lee, stops and stares at the grinning marksman.    After a beat, Red turns then nearly jumps out of shoes with   a sudden right cross that floors the younger man. Red starts   to jump in for more but Hendricks, stunned, jumps in, grabs   Red and, joined by four other Officers, holds the older man   back. Shouting, i.e. ""Hey, hey, Red, whoa, whoa!"" Red settles a bit. Hendricks turns to Bobby Lee who rises to one knee and wipes at a bloody lip, and then to Red who is still breathing hard. HENDRICKS What the hell was that all about?! RED I didn't say 'when.' "
143.,"229   CONTINUED:    Goddammit!! Adler catches up to Red.   He stares at his old friend and boss as they walk along. ADLER I thought he had a gun, too, Red.   There was just no way of knowin'. Red doesn't even look at Adler, just keeps walking.    Adler stops, his eyes following Red. Sally, nearby, watches Red walk away. PHILLIP is helped to his feet by his mother. She holds him dearly to her chest. He hugs back just as hard, his blood-stained Casper outfit staining her blouse. She unzips the costume and dollar bills fly all around. She starts to lead Phillip off but he won't leave until... He pulls the postcard from Butch's hand. CLOSEUP - PHILLIP Staring down at Butch. CLOSEUP - BUTCH His eyes flutter a bit with recognition."
144.,"229   CONTINUED:                                                 229 Red reaches into his pocket, pulls out his tobacco and stuffs a chunk into his mouth. IN FIELD - CLOSEUP - BUTCH He licks his lips as the MUFFLED VOICES CONTINUE around him. He squints hard and sees: HELICOPTER as it lifts off and speeds away.    As it wipes the sun... CLOSEUP - BUTCH A slight smile crosses his dying face as he squints to see Phillip's flight. CLOSEUP - PHILLIP Nose pressed against the glass bubble. BUTCH His eyes don't close, still squinted but frozen. CLOSEUP - EYES We realize now, are lifeless. BUZZARD continues its flight past the sun. SUN flares, SENDING the SCREEN TO:"
