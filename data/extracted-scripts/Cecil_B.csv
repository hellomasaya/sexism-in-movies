sinclair, Have you met her yet?
sinclair,You promise?
honey,"Ah, what a town! HONEY is dressed for the premiere in an elegant evening gown and her black hair is cut perfectly in the Louise Brooks style that has become her signature. She continues her press conference under the watchful eyes of her press agent CHARLES and her long-time assistant LIBBY, both of whom are also dressed for the premiere. ROOM SERVICE employees stand by, ready to serve."
honey,"I tell everybody in Hollywood, when you shoot on location in Baltimore, you don't need to bring all the crew from Los Angeles. Baltimore really ia the best!..."
honey,"Look at this dump of a town! HONEY turns to her long suffering assistant, LIBBY. The press is gone and they are alone."
honey,"Get me the fuck back to L.A. If one more asshole mentions a crab cake to me, I think I'll puke."
libby, Did you try the steamed crabs? They're red and...
honey,No I didn't! I'm not interested in any kind of meal you have to beat with a mallet... A knock is heard at hotel door.
charles,"Your limousine is here, Miss Whitlock. You look beautiful."
honey," Thank you Charles, darling. We'll be right with you. I'm excited. CHARLES exits."
honey, Do you think Pat Nixon got fucked in this hotel room?
honey,"It's called the ""Presidential Suite"" isn't it?"
libby,Yes...but...
honey,I BET SHE DID! Call the manager and ask him!
honey,"It's your  to ask, Libby! Call downstairs and find out if Pat Nixon got fucked in my hotel room! I want to know!"
libby," The hotel manager said ""No."" Pat Nixon never stayed here,"
libby,Well. . .sort of. I mean you told me...
honey,"I was kidding Libby. He must think you're a complete lunatic! Good God, you'd do anything! A HOTEL MAID pushing a cart of towels and bathroom supplies comes around a corner and is completely star-struck."
maid,"Good luck, Miss Whitlock! HONEY's face freezes in horror as elevator doors open and she is led inside."
honey, Did you hear what that little bitch said to me?
libby,She didn't know.
honey,"In show business we say ""break a leg."" NEVER fucking ""Good Luck""!"
honey,That cocksucker put a curse on my whole fucking premiere! HOTEL GUESTS let out a cry of shock at HONEY's language.
honey,"Mayor Fenwick! LIBBY and CHARLES look to one another relieved as HOTEL GUESTS stumble out of elevator, shaking their heads in disgust."
mayor,"Miss Whitlock, what an honor! They pose together as PRESS snaps away."
honey,I love what you've done with this city.
mayor,"And Baltimore loves you back!  I, Adam Fenwick, Mayor of the City of Baltimore, do hereby proclaim April 29th to be Honey Whitlock Day in Maryland and do command this observation to all of our citizens. Whereas..."
petie, 6:41pm.
sinclair," 10-4, Petie. SINCLAIR nods gravely to LYLE the projectionist who picks up a 35mm metal film can and sneaks up behind MR. STILLINGS who is looking down from projection booth to the premiere CROWD filling the theater below."

lewis,"(Into walkie, as he searches"
chardonnay," Ticket, please... 18. Cut back to EXTERIOR HARBOR COURT HOTEL. 18. Closeup of HONEY WHITLOCK's furious face as she stares in horror at awaiting white stretch limousine driven by"
charles,"What's the matter, Miss Whitlock?"
honey,A fucking white limousine?!
libby,"Oh nobody will know, we're in Baltimore..."
honey,"I'm not Liberace's boyfriend, for Chrissakes...My contract says black limousines only!"
libby,The charity probably made the arrangements. It was an innocent mistake.
mayor," Break a leg, Miss Whitlock! RODNEY, in a panic, keeps checking his watch."
rodney,"Excuse me, ma'am, but Security's gonna have my ass if we're late..."
honey,(Turning on him with a
ticket buyer, The Heart Fund must be thrilled at the turnout.

sinclair, 7:06pm...The Big Snatch. HONEY steps from limo and waves like a true star to roar of approval from crowd as PRESS blinds her with flashbulbs.
sinclair," Good evening, Miss Whitlock, and welcome to the historic Senator Theater."
little william," Get off me, ugly."
cecil,I fuckin' hate car chase scenes!
petie,"(Flooring the accelerator,"
lyle,"But it lead to the ""French Connection."""
lewis,"And lead to ""Smokey and The Bandit"" and that kinda shit! PETIE sees another cop car speeding up behind him in the rear view mirror. DINAH leans out limo window and fires gun back'at cop car."
petie," Yeah, Part fucking Two, 1980!..."
cherish, Long live pornography!
raven, Your mother sucks cocks in hell! HEAVY METAL KIDS look at each other in horror and run
suburban lady,"Sinclair, is that you? PETIE turns down radio and GANG freezes."
cecil," Hi, Mrs. Waltrup."
suburban lady,Did you win the lottery?
suburban lady,"I don't go to the movies much, I wait for the video."
cecil,"Not me, I like the big screen."
suburban lady,Say hello to your mom and dad for me.
cecil,I sure will. SUBURBAN LADY makes right on red and pulls off.
cecil," Casting has been completed! PETIE peels out in other direction. 53. Cut to EXTERIOR ""SPROCKET HOUSE,"" a run-down, 53. seemingly abandoned warehouse in an industrial part of t:he city. The moon is full and the quiet is interrupted by faint sirens in the distance. Suddenly, like a low-rent Bat Cave, the large industrial garage doors swing open and the white limo speeds inside. 54. Dissolve to INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. HONEY's 54. ""dressing room""; a bizarrely decorated prison cell fit for a movie queen. HONEY is blindfolded, gagged and tied to a director's chair with her name printed on the back, still wearing her torn and soiled premiere gown. LEWIS, now dressed in terrorist punk outfit removes HONEY's blindfold and gag as she sputters in terror. We see LEWIS has D-A-V-I-D L-Y-N-C-H tattooed on his fingers. HONEY's e yes light up in terror as she sees CECIL, now attired in insane grunge Cecil B. DeMille inspired outfit being lowered by PETIE on jerry-rigged film crane. ""Otto Preminger"" is tattooed on CECIL's bicep."
cecil,".Hello, I'm Cecil B. DeMented and I'm your new director... HONEY stares in confused horror."
cecil,"I'd like you to meet your co-stars ...I call them the ""Sprocket Holes."" HONEY looks over in fear as the SPROCKET HOLES, now changed from their theater uniforms into their own scary ""terrorist chic"" fashions, gather around CECIL in a ""crew-shot from hell"" pose."
cecil,"This is Cherish... CHERISH, now heavily made-up and dressed ""riot-girl"" style, in a ""SINEMA"" T-shirt, steps forward. We see ""Andy Warhol"" tattooed on her thigh."
cherish,"Hi, I played you in lots of porno movies. ""Some Kind Of Happiness""? I've already shot it - only it's called ""Some Kind Of Horniness."""
cecil,"Lyle? LYLE takes a big huff of glue in plastic bag and steps forward. He is dressed in scarily in 1970's junky wear meets 90's Hollywood sleaze, and sports a ""Herschell Gordon Lewis"" tattoo across his skinny chest."
lyle,"Hi, I'm Lyle and I'm your leading man. I've had a boner for you for years. HONEY pales."
cecil," Don't worry, we've all taken a vow of celibacy for celluloid. No one gets laid until we've finished our movie. We're horny... CHERISH starts writhing sexily."
cecil,.but our film comes first. CECIL gently shoves her away as SPROCKET HOLES undulate in sexual frustration.
cecil,.And now for the crew. PAM the popcorn girl swaggers over carrying a beat-up vintage 16mm movie camera and aims it at HONEY's face. She is wearing a black para-military jump suit and we
pam,"I'm Pam, the director of photography and you'd better hit your mark! CHARDONNAY, now done up in outrageous homegirl gangster look, carries an old wrecked Nagra sound recorder and spins her microphone boom pole like lethal numchucks before raising it over HONEY's head, revealing the ""Spike Lee"" tattoo on her stomach."
chardonnay,".and remember - SPEAK UP, BITCH! I'm Chardonnay and I do the sound. LEWIS proudly steps forward, menacingly holding staple gun like a weapon."
lewis,"We met. I'm Lewis, the art director. I hope you'll be comfortable here... HONEY looks around cell and sees giant stills blown up from her past films showing her in physical and emotional distress."
raven,"Hi, I'm Raven and I'm a Satanist. I'll be doing your makeup... HONEY stares back in confusion."
raven,You look so pale... RAVEN suddenly slaps HONEY across face and HONEY cries out in shock.
raven,"Sorry... but Satan says... you need color! RODNEY, the biker ""bodyguard,"" now in S&M leather get-up steps toward HONEY carrying a rat-tail comb and a hair dye applicator bottle. His ""Almodovar"" tattoo is a beauty."
rodney,"Call me Rodney. Tomorrow I'm bleaching your hair out platinum and I should warn you...I FUCKING HATE ROOTS! PETIE, the sexy hillbilly ""chauffeur,"" now dressed in redneck militant garb and featuring a ""Fassbinder"" tattoo, steps forward."
petie,"Hey, I'm Petie, remember me, ""the trailer trash""? I'll be your driver. I'll take you anywhere... anywhere but home!! (Laughs evilly as he"
dinah," I'm Dinah, Cecil's prodcer and I do everything! I've been knocking down box office money from every big Hollywood hit for years to pay for this"
newsman,". So once again, our top story. Sylvia Mallory, the fifty-two year old chairwoman of the Maryland Heart Fund died tonight at Union Memorial Hospital following an on stage heart attack she suffered in the middle of Honey Whitlock's kidnapping at tonight's Baltimore movie premiere... SPROCKET HOLES stare in amazement at TV screen, the enormity of their act barely sinking in."
newsman,".the teenage gang of cinema terrorists who apparently infiltrated the staff of the Senator Theater are now eligible for the death penalty in the State of Maryland... CECIL nods to DINAH to turn it off, which she does. SPROCKET HOLES gulp and look to their leader for guidance. CECIL steps forward, getting right in HONEY's terrified face."
cecil,"Miss Whitlock, we're going to make our first film and NOBODY'S going to stop us. Lots of kids dream of making a movie... SPROCKET HOLES smile in brain-washed enthusiasm."
cecil,.but only the ones willing to dia for it succeed. HONEY looks into CECIL's face and lets out a sob of terror.
rodney,You're going right off the deep end of the Clairol color chart! RODNEY squirts on more dye.
honey,It's burning my scalp! Ow! Ow! Ow!
rodney,Beauty comes from agony! Everyone knows that!
raven,I haven't had this much fun since my last livestock mutilation... RAVEN lunges towards HONEY's eyebrows and painfully tweezes out a hair.
honey,Oh God! That really hurt!
raven,"""In the House of Pain, there"
rodney,Let's wash it out! RODNEY yanks HONEY's head back as RAVEN pours scalding water over her head.
honey,"(Screams in pain,"
honey," .I mean... not little. . .10w budget. . .you know, cult."
cecil,"Good morning, Miss Whitlock. Know your lines?"
honey,Please...Mr. DeMento? Is that correct?
honey,You have the wrong star for this film...
cecil,"Nonsense, Miss Whitlock..."
dinah,(Ignoring passing police
cecil,"Ah Fidget. Fidget, my little genius, :Fidget!"
fidget,"(Not missing a beat,"
cecil,"(To HONEY, ever the"
honey, The Screen Actors Guild will hear about this and I mean it! HONEY lets gown fall to floor and steps out of it. She is wearing beautiful lingerie.
honey,"Oh, God, I look terrible!  CECIL and SPROCKET HOLES applaud triumphantly."
dinah," Alright, LET'S LOCK IT UP!"
cecil,Can't you say good morning to Lewis? He worked hard on this set with a budget of zero.
honey,Good... morning.
cecil,"Our picture is called ""Raving Beauty."" You play the insane owner of a failed art theater who along with her film fanatic boyfriend Lyle. . .Lyle come on over... LYLE enters dressed in hepcat 70's junkie splendor wear."
cecil,".and her violence prone daughter, Cherish... CHERISH enters in eye-popping ""super model goes bad"" look as HONEY's eyes light up in horror."
honey,"""Daughter""?!"
cecil,".Together, the three of you vow to start a revolution to destroy mainstream cinema..."
cecil,You dare to tell Cecil B. DeMented you refuse!
honey,I'm too young to play her mother!
honey, It doesn't feel right... I'm just not motivated...
cecil,(Advancing on her with
cecil,"There are no creative differences on a Cecil B. DeMented set, Miss Whitlock. Got that? One day you'll thank me for saving you from your bad career. "
cecil,".and ACTION! CECIL moves around stage, making cliche director's frame with his hands as PAM and CHARDONNAY rehearse camera and sound moves behind him. All the camera equipment has ""UNIV OF MD"" stenciled on it that has been scratched out half-heartedly."
lyle," Hey, Cherish, it's 8:00. Am I supposed to get this show on the screen or what!?"
cherish," I didn't sell one ticket, Lyle. Nobody came!"
honey," It's that fucking new multiplex that opened in the mall, isn't it? CECIL's face turns to stone as the rest of the SPROCKET HOLES watch, shocked at HONEY's wooden performance."
cherish,"I heard they were sold out last night, Mom!"
honey," Somebody's gotta pay for this insult! HONEY looks out and sees SPROCKET HOLES aping CECIL's self-destructive review of her reading; DINAH slaps her own face, LEWIS staples his own leg; RODNEY jams the sharp end of a rat-tail comb in his ear. This title will be replaced by a more recent critically panned big film hit we can get the rights to."
honey, Death to those who support mainstream cinema!
pam,Camera rolling.
chardonnay,(Spinning sound boom
pam,Mark it! DINAH marks the take.
lyle," Hey, Cherish, it's 8:00. Am I supposed to get this show on the screen or what?"
lyle,Pasolini's playing and we have an empty theater? HONEY enters and does the lines convincingly.
cherish,"I heard they were sold out last night, Mom."
lyle,"Not for ""THE FLINTSTONES""?!"
honey, Somebody's gotta pay for this insult! CECIL silently mouths the dialogue along with HONEY.
honey,"From the empty movie seats of every good movie theater in America, we will rise to take back the screen!"
honey,Death to those who support mainstream cinema!
cecil,"That's more like it, Miss Whitlock! CHERISH gives HONEY a suddenly jealous look."
honey," To be frank, Cecil, I would never do this picture in my real film life. The whole message is stupid - ask theater owners in any country and they'll tell you. Hollywood makes the best films in the world and I'm proud to be part of that system."
cecil, Let's move on!
cecil,The first take is the only real truth...
honey,But you can't cut the film with only a master!
cecil,"There are no rules in outlaw cinema, Miss Whitlock, only edges. We believe technique to be nothing more than failed style. You see, I've had a vision... All the SPROCKET HOLES smile like film zombies to"
cecil,".and that vision is called ""ultimate reality."" The rest of our film is shot in real life, with real people ... . and yes, with real terror. 63. Flip wipe to EXTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. Industrial 63. doors swing open and freshly painted phony FEDEX truck comes speeding out."
rodney,I see a fucking root already! He lunges to HONEY's scalp with hair dye applicator bottle.
honey,"Owwww! Please, Cecil. I'm a much better actress in the studio..."
cecil,That's not what TIME Magazine has to say.
lewis,Your picture's gonna lose thirty million dollars.
honey," Cecil, give yourself up! It's not too late..."
lewis,Our film goes into profit the day we sell the first ticket!
petie," How big is his dick, anyway?"
honey, Come to Hollywood with me and I promise I'll get you a job as a production assistant on a real Hollywood movie.
cecil,.and remember there are no bad takes in a Cecil B. DeMented picture - just keep the scene going
lyle, I never took this much acid
cherish,"(Primping with FIDGET'S help,"
honey,"Cecil, please don't make me do this scene..."
cecil,Your Hollywood system stole our sex and co-opted our violence so there's nothing left for our kind of movies... except this!
dinah,Roll camera.
pam,Camera rolling.
chardonnay,Speed. DINAH marks the take.
cecil,"(Aiming his gun at HONEY,"
honey," How dare you play this rotten movie?! PAM pans the camera to BOX OFFICE LADY whose eyes light up in fear at seeing the ""actors"" in their terrorist outfits."
cecil,"(Yelling to ""actors"" into"
honey, $7.50 for this piece of shit?! BOX OFFICE LADY screams and locks herself inside as HONEY spray-paints S-H-I-T across box office glass.
lyle,"(To HONEY, breaking out"
cecil,"I am Cecil B. DeMented and you're in my movie! Look in the camera and ruin a take and you're both dead! CANDY COUNTER GIRLS get nervy, eager to be in any movie."
lyle,You call THAT a SMALL??!!
manager,(Walking right into
manager, Please ...I didn't make this movie ... . I'm just the manager... CHARDONNAY knocks him out cold with one smack of her boom pole.
cecil, Say the lines!
honey,"(To AUDIENCE, ferociously"
cherish,"Come on, Cecil, I want a little ""action"" of my own!"
cecil," I'm trying to write, Cherish! HONEY, looking more relaxed, with only one leg cuffed to director's chair, watches herself on film in the arty, grainy, but very striking footage. RAVEN does a ""devil dance"" with herself and ritualistically drinks from a skull head."
fidget,Miss Whitlock?
honey,"Oh, craft service. Thank you, Fidget, but I never drink when I'm working but you're very kind. Do your parents know where you are tonight?"
fidget,They're probably mad...
honey,Don't you think you ought to call them...?
honey,"You know that's nonsense! Go ahead, call them up. I bet they miss you... LYLE ruins everything by staggering over, scarily high."
lyle,"Hey Honey, want some crack?"
honey,"I most certainly do NOT, Lyle. I can't believe you'd be a drug addict in the 90's - it's so retro."
lyle,"Before I was a drug addict, I had so many different problems, Honey. Now I just have one - drugs. It gave my life a real focus. Cut to CECIL on crane with CHERISH as they hornily watch CHERISH on film."
cherish, How can you see me on film and not want to fuck me?!
cecil," I S-Q want to fuck you, Cherish, but you know I can't..."
cherish,Why not?!
cecil," I'm not ""all your directors,"" Cherish."
cecil," SOLDIERS OF CINEMA, save your sexual energy for the silver screen... SPROCKET HOLES break apart and look up to CECIL."
cecil,Our footage is stronger than Otto Preminger's... CHERISH licks CECIL's tattoo.
cecil,.creepier and darker than David Lynch's... LEWIS scratches a sexual note in the music as he lusts towards CHARDONNAY who sings out a torrid moan.
cecil,".more exploitative than Herschel Gordon Lewis. LYLE humps the projector, out of his mind."
cecil,".and more violent than Sam Fuller..- DINAH writhes in horniness, pulls her pistol and fires at ""The Films of David Lean"" coffee table book she uses as a target."
cecil,We will rise above our raging hormones to a new level of cinema unrest! Cut to FIDGET sneakily dialing parents on phone as HONEY nods her support.
cecil,. Do whatever it takes to avoid sexual release! Get as drunk as Sam Peckinpah... PAM guzzles whisky.
cecil,As high as Rainer Werner Fassbinder!... LYLE sniffs fumes from an aerosol can of metallic paint.
cecil,But stay celibate for celluloid! Cut back to FIDGET on phone. We see his suburban MOM answer on split screen.
fidget,"I'm fine. The movie's going great, Mom!"
cecil,.Feel the black humor of Almodovar... RODNEY dances a wild S&M step and tries to look PETIE in the eyes.
cecil,".the satanic fury of Kenneth Anger! RAVEN, possessed by the devil, rolls her eyes back in devil horniness."
cecil,.the racial tension of Spike Lee... CHARDONNAY lets out a soulful wail as she dances in sexual abandon.
cecil,(Spotting FIDGET on the phone and giving him the
fidget's mom," Hello? Fidget, talk to me! Hello? We'll come and get you! Tell us where you are! Hello? Hello? FIDGET hangs up phone and starts playing pocket pool frantically. HONEY sighs and shakes her head in disappointment."
lewis," If we can't have sex, can't we at least make money?"
chardonnay," Yeah, Lewis thinks I could have a hit record!"
cecil,"Oh, Andy Warhol, we worship you from the new cinema underground..."
all,"Oh, Andy Warhol, we worship you from the new cinema underground... HONEY guzzles down the martini. CHERISH prays the hardest, still sexually aroused."
cecil,.help us to use our sexual frustrations as you did for the future of outlaw film!
cecil,(In a booming voice to all the SPROCKET HOLES
rodney, I see that fucking brown color...
honey,"Please Rodney, those aren't roots - they're scabs on my scalp from the dye and they're raw! RODNEY sadistically squirts her roots with dye as HONEY lets out a cry of agony."
honey,"OWWWW!! Please... please...  Raven, you're a pretty girl, you could escape this madness..."
raven,"Escape to what, Honey?"
honey,Well ...I'm sorry to hear that...
raven,And one day I'm gonna commit revolutionary suicide for celluloid...
honey,"OWWWW! Rodney, why do you want to hurt me? Gay men are supposed to be gentle..."
rodney," That's just it, Honey! I'm not gay. I'm straight and I fucking hate it! Petie loves me but I can't love him back! I've tried! I kiss him and all I feel is beard."
rodney,(Suddenly snapping back
raven,It's not Honey's fault.
rodney,Make them pay for me thinking about pussy! RODNEY rips out a clump of HONEY'S teased hair with brush.
honey,"Oh God, stop..."
cecil,"Good morning, Miss Whitlock."
cecil,Whatever for? Your old career is over. . .but your comeback has just begun... CECIL nods to DINAH to start tape and we see a TEENAGE BOY on news in front of vandalized Timonium theater.
teenage boy,".I was in the audience when they attacked and I'll tell you. . .Honey Whitlock was awesome! HONEY looks in confusion to CECIL who smiles proudly back. Tape jumps to a different news show showing TEEN GIRL, wearing a handmade ""CECIL RULES"" T-shirt. She stands out front of the popular local art house, The Charles Theater."
teen girl,"I think Honey Whitlock is right - most films suck and it's time somebody did something about it... HONEY catches herself half smiling at the favorable mention. Tape cuts to TIMONIUM THEATER MANAGER, his head now bandaged."
theater manager,".Nobody forced her to be in that movie, I could see that, but she was damn good! Scarier than hell, if you ask me! She looked different from her other films, too...I don't know... younger. HONEY's face lights up but CECIL quickly brings her down to earth."
cecil,"There are still some people who don't understand our work... DINAH zaps on TV and we see MIDDLE-AGED MAN in suit behind podium at press conference. Subtitle identifies him as ""MARYLAND FILM COMMISSIONER."""
film commissioner,"Cecil B. DeMented, the Maryland Film Commission refuses to be intimidated by your pathetic gang of cinematic misfits... SPROCKET HOLES let out a howl of disgust as HONEY pales. 77. Cut to ""PRIDE OF BALTIMORE,"" a tall tourist 77. attraction docked in the Inner Harbor, the popular retail area on the water near the Convention Center. The ""Hollywood Oyster Bash"" is in progress as FILM COMMISSIONER continues his speech."
film commissioner,".That's why we're here today on ""The Pride of Baltimore"" to celebrate location shooting in Maryland with many of the brave production and studio heads from out of state who also say NO to cinema terrorism."
cecil,".And this time somebody might have to die! 79. Wipe to EXTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. 79. Doors swing open and CECIL's speeding van, driven by PETIE and now hurriedly painted over to resemble UTZ Potato Chips delivery vehicle, flies out and careens around the corner."
cecil,"(Finishing up last page of script, to HONEY, LYLE"
lyle,We'll let these fat cat producers know!
cherish,"Yeah, that Maryland is not safe for their kind of movies!"
honey,"Cherish, this is America. They have the freedom to make bad films if they so desire..."
cecil,Not anymore they don't!
cherish," You think just 'cause you made ""real"" movies that you're better than me, don't you?"
honey,"Oh, please..."
cherish,"Do you know w I became a porno star?! SPROCKET HOLES groan, they've heard it before."
cherish,"I guess you are. ""Jingle Balls, Jingle Balls,"" my stupid brother started singing. You think that's funny?"
honey,No...not at all.
cecil,"It's all behind you now, Cherish.  We're here..."
film commissioner,Ask anyone who's shot their film in Maryland! We have the exact location you need for your next production...

lyle,"Hey Honey, nervous? Wanna try some ""Special K""?"
honey,"I'm working, Lyle!"
cherish,"""Human pile,"" screamed my grandfather as they all jumped on! Do you know what a human pile is?! CECIL leads them up rickety steps to second floor trap door."
honey,I. .I can figure it out...
film commissioner,.From mountains to beaches... small towns to urban settings... OYSTER SHUCKER goes to get more oysters in kitchen and DINAH jumps him from behind holding a shucker to his neck.
film commissioner,.The Maryland Film Commission pledges to work with state and federal agencies... A WAITER opens closet door and PAM punches him in
film commissioner,. to make your shoot here in Maryland... PRODUCERS and STUDIO EXECS suck down oysters from PAM's tray.

cherish,(Climaxing her tirade
honey,I. .I believe you.
cecil,A simple little stunt.

chardonnay,"Speed. DINAH marks the take. PARTY GUESTS fix their hair, smile, thinking they are in a promotional film."
cecil," I kidnapped the right star, didn't I? HONEY smiles weakly."
film commissioner,"No...please...I was only following studio orders. HONEY throws what she thinks is her ""prop"" grenade. The FILM COMMISSIONER dives out of the way and it explodes. HONEY, horrified that the ""effect"" was real looks up to CECIL but he has vanished. Suddenly CECIL enters the ship ""directing"" through megaphone."
cecil,ALL EXTRAS - keep eating the oysters or you will be shot and killed!
dinah,(Shoving party guests
lyle, Didn't you produce that foreign language hit that was remade badly in English?
cherish, Didn't you just greenlight another new movie based on a video game?
lyle,"Help me, Cherish. I'm stuck in a K-hole and I can't get out! CHERISH, firing her gun wildly, runs to LYLE and manages to pull him ""off set"" as HONEY freezes in terror deciding between her director or the POLICE. CHARDONNAY fires her gun and accidentally blasts her ears over earphone and lunges to turn down volume control on her Nagra."

honey,"DON'T SHOOT! I'm Honey Whitlock and I've been kidnapped! HONEY is shocked when the POLICE tackle her and place her under arrest. DINAH grabs FILM COMMISSIONER and uses him as a human shield as she fires away, hitting several cops."

LYLE projects the dailies of the day on wall as he pops Percodans. HONEY, out of her cell and unguarded for the first time, watches her ""stunt"" footage with pride as she gets the vodka bottle from their filthy dirty freezer and goes about the ritual of making the perfect martini. LEWIS, proudly displaying his brand, DJ's the music as CHERISH writhes in a sexy go-go dance for CECIL. CHARDONNAY painfully caresses her fresh brand and wails out the chorus of ""DeMented Forever.""

cecil, And to top it off...they talk out loud in the theater once the feature has begun! SPROCKET HOLES grimace in horror. Even HONEY shakes her head in disgust as she pours martini into glass.
honey,"That really is unforgivable, Fidget!"
cecil,And you...Honey?

honey," This time, .1 have a fucking vision! CECIL's eyes light up in madman glee. 105. Cut to EXTERIOR ""STUDIO TWELVE,"" the one 105. professional sound stage in Baltimore located in the picturesque downtown neighborhood of Fells Point. Next day. A giant FILM CREW, all wearing ""Gump Again"" t-shirts, hustle and bustle on the first day of the film shoot, hauling expensive film equipment inside, setting up catering trucks, craft service tables and the temporary dining areas for the entire FILM COMPANY. TEAMSTERS oversee crew trucks, honey wagons and the star trailers, all the while guarding the set from any outside trouble. In the foreground, the Hiway Film Delivery Truck pulls up, hastily painted over to read ""Rhebs Chocolates."" We see PETIE behind the wheel, disguised in delivery uniform. TEAMSTER A steps over to check security."
petie,We got a delivery for Michael j. Fox from Paramount Studios.

Suddenly TEAMSTER B opens fire and shoots LYLE in the back of the head right in the middle of CECIL's take. MICHAEL J. FOX and DIRECTOR dive for cover under park bench as LARGE LADY runs for her life.
lyle, Drugs.. .give me drugs... RAVEN runs forward with a bottle of poppers and gives LYLE a snort. He smiles and twitches in final death rattle.
cecil, It's OK! We got it on film!
pam, Visions of light! HONEY gulps as bullets whiz around her head and then jumps right back into character.
cherish," .my derriere... Cut to AUDIENCE of single men watching hornily as whole rows of seats vibrate from audience ""participation."""

LEWIS, CHARDONNAY, PAM, PETIE and RAVEN watch hornily along with moaning AUDIENCE as a frustrated FIDGET attempts to play pocket pool with his injured bleeding hand. Even HONEY is a little turned on and dares to catch GROUPIE's eyes again."

groupie,"Come on, you didn't know... On drive-in screen, HONEY's character clutches the cat, races down steps to first floor of her house and sees HIT MAN #2 briefly staring through front door. Her CHARACTER runs to kitchen in fear and drops cat to get butcher knife out of kitchen drawer. RAVEN and FIDGET, both injured, touch up and adjust HONEY's final insane terrorist-chic look."
fidget,"None of your old movies count. CAT, on screen, scurries through ""cat-door"" cut in kitchen wall and escapes outside. In car next to HONEY, REDNECK MOM, POP and DORKY KID watch the movie. MOM is weary ""Honey Whitlock"" wig."
redneck mom,I bet she's Miss Phony Baloney in real life.
redneck dad,She don't look so hot to me. I prefer Meg Ryan or somebody younger.
dorky kid, Can I get more food?
redneck mom, I told you to stop slurping! REDNECK MOM suddenly sees HONEY WHITLOCK and quickly turns back around.

fidget,We're beyond the critics' reach!
raven,"Who cares what anybody thinks of our movie except Satan?! HONEY, FIDGET and RAVEN pull GROUPIE away towards concession stand."
cecil,"Hello, this is Cecil B. DeMented speaking to you directly from this theater... CECIL FANS A, B & C jump out of their cars happily along with other supporters. REDNECK FAMILY guiltily starts up engine of car, hoping to escape along with other terrified FAMILIES. JOCKS A, B & C leap from car, ready for a fight as do other gung-ho CECIL ENEMIES."

EXTERIOR ROOF OF CONCESSION STAND. Lit like a sound 162. stage from car headlights. LEWIS backs out on roof pulling PAM with camera in MANAGER's wheelchair that she is using as a dolly. CHARDONNAY follows with boom pole to record th' sound. PETIE and FIDGET struggle to carry CECIL on ""set"" in a makeshift stretcher as RAVEN applies makeup to his wounds. CHERISH is at his side, caressing him lovingly."
cecil,"Honey, I've had a final vision. Would you set your hair on fire for our movie...?"
cecil," Prove yourself one more time... for your cast... HONEY looks into CHERISH's brainwashed face as her eyes roll back in her head, flash cut with ""Directed by Andy Warhol"" credit."
cecil,"Your crew... SPROCKET HOLES stare back at HONEY in a fast montage of their insane faces hallucinating credits of their favorite directors: William Castle, Kenneth Anger, Sam Peckinpah, Spike Lee, David Lynch, Fassbinder. FIDGET holds a pitiful fire extinguisher."
cecil,"Your fans... HONEY looks to GROUPIE in a sea of cheering FANS. He is finishing up carving HONEY's initials ""H.W."" in his forehead with a pop-top beer can tab."
cecil,".and for me, Cecil B. DeMented!"
honey,But will it...make me a legend?
cecil, You will be the eternal flame of cinema insanity. HONEY's eyes glaze over in cult madness.
honey,"I'm.. . ready for my closeup, Mr. DeMented. RAVEN dabs HONEY's hair with gasoline from can. FIDGET painfully plays pocket pool and lights the torch."
cecil,The Martini shot... HONEY smiles nostalgically at the mention of her favorite drink.
