Speaker,Dialogue
lydia,"-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --"
meg,Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
lydia,No cars.  Feet are faster.
meg,How many more do we have after this?
lydia,"None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is."
meg,"This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here."
sarah,"Mom, it's the sidewalk."
lydia,"Oh, that miserable little prick is already leaving."
evan,"One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --"
lydia,"Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!"
evan,"This is the middle of the house, the entry floor, living room's over there.  The kitchen floor's below us and there's two bedroom floors above."
evan,"It's an enormous amount of space for the money and I'll be perfectly honest, the family is in no hurry whatsoever."
evan,I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
lydia,"No ball, kid."
evan,"Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones."
meg,Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
evan,"What say we see the house before we dicker, hmm?  I have to warn you, this is exactly the response we expected to get. It's a very emotional property."
lydia,Who taught you to negotiate?
sarah,"It's not like Saks', Mom, you don't have to pay the price on the tag."
meg,"I'm sorry.  Apartments, and... money, and... this is more my husband's area."
meg,Was.  His area.  I'm not very good at...
meg,"Things, and if I can't prove to my soon to-be ex-husband that I can provide a suitable place for our daughter to live in the next fourteen days, it's going to get ugly between us.  Uglier."
evan,"Top floor.  Two bedrooms, one bathroom."
evan,"Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office."
lydia, He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
evan, Master bath.
lydia,"The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!"
evan,I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
lydia," Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous."
evan, Master closet.
evan,Could the child please stop that?
lydia,KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
evan,And we emerge in the master bedroom.
meg,Something's weird.
lydia,What?
meg,"I don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?"
evan,"I was waiting to see if you'd notice!  On caravan, no one from our office had the slightest idea."
evan,It's called a panic room.
meg,A what?
evan,"A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times."
lydia,"Oh, I've seen these..."
evan,It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
lydia,"Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!"
evan,"Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --"
evan,-- covering almost every corner of the house.
meg,Makes me nervous.
lydia,Why?
meg,Ever read any Poe?
lydia,"I don't think so, but I love her album."
meg,"No, Edgar Allen."
lydia, The furniture guy?
meg, What's to keep them from prying open the door?
evan,"Steel, four inches thick."
evan,"Everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional."
meg,Open it.
lydia,"Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?"
meg,Open the door.
lydia,"And with kids like he's got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide."
evan,That's highly inappropriate.
meg,I said open the door.
sarah,My room.  Definitely my room.
lydia,That door is a safely hazard.
evan,Not at all.
evan,Infrared.  Like the beam in an elevator doorway.  Won't let the door close if something's blocking it.
evan,Watch.
evan," Push that button for me, will you?"
meg,Don't!
sarah,Too many stairs.
meg,"Got us in here, didn't I?"
sarah,Shoulda got an apartment.
meg,"Well, I know that now."
meg,Battery's dead.
meg,"The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone."
sarah, The crowd goes wild.
voice,"Perry's Pizza, please hold."
sarah,Fuck him.
meg,Don't.
sarah,Fuck her too.
meg,I agree.  But don't.
sarah,"""Tom's throat felt so dry and tight that it was a moment before he could make any sound come out.  ""Dad!"" He croaked.  ""I'm - inside - the - machine!"" ""Great Scott!""  The elder scientist gasped.  He dashed across the laboratory and switched off the repelatron's motor.  ""What happened, son?"" ""The Durafoam hardened, Dad. Get a solvent, quick -- you know the formula!"""
meg,"Bypass non-ready zones... shunt, enter, zone number..."
meg,"Bypass non-ready zones... ah, shunt, enter, shunt again, zone number... wait..."
junior,Fuck.
burnham,I know.
raoul,What?
burnham,"A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs."
junior,Fuck!
burnham,Keep your voice down.
junior,They're not supposed to be here!
burnham,"This was your department, Junior."
junior,They're not supposed to be here!
burnham,"That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks."
junior,"Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!"
burnham, Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
junior,Fourteen business days.  Escrow is always business days.
junior,"I mean, right?  Isn't it?"
burnham,You're an idiot.
raoul,Watch your mouth.
junior,"It's okay, Raoul."
burnham, Who is this guy?
junior,Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
burnham,This is insane.  I'm outta here.
junior,"Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?"
raoul,It's just the woman and the kid?
burnham,Unless Daddy comes back later.
junior,"Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?"
raoul,You're fuckin' A we can do this.
burnham,Not with me.  Not with people.
junior,Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
burnham,"She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked."
junior,So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can totally administrate that part.
raoul,No problem.
burnham,I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
junior,They won't get hurt.
burnham,What about us?  What if she has a gun?
junior,"Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?"
burnham,Asshole.
junior,"A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?"
burnham,Where did you get this clown?
junior,"I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now."
burnham,What tables?  I've never seen him before.
junior,Different tables.
burnham, The fuck did you bring a gun for?
raoul,You're welcome.
burnham,Peace out.
junior,"We can't do it without you, Burnham."
junior,It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
burnham,Yeah.  Kidnapping.
junior,"Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure."
burnham,Pure idiot.
junior,"I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An idiot's grandson.  I'm third- generation idiot.  But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy.  You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early?  I can't believe my eyes.  Come on, Buddy.  One more hand."
raoul, No face.
junior,"Top floor, get the little girl and keep her there.  I'll bring the woman up.  Gimme."
junior, Stay here.  Nobody gets past you.
meg,Wake up... wake up...
meg,"Wake up...come on, come on..."
sarah,WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?!
sarah,What's going on?!
meg,People.  In the house.
raoul,IN THE ELEVATOR!  BOTH OF 'EM HEADED TOWARD YOU!
meg,He's going down.
sarah,That room!
meg,What?!
sarah,PANIC ROOM!
sarah,No.  you gotta...
junior,SHE'S COMING BACK UP TOWARD YOU!!
meg,Damn it!
sarah,It doesn't work?!
meg,"Different phone line, I never hooked it up!"
burnham,Tell me... tell me they're not in there...
meg,Can't hear a thing.
sarah,What do they want?
meg,I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
sarah,What do we do?
meg,Wait.
sarah,What if they get in here?
meg,They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
sarah,I heard you.
meg,Feel okay?
sarah,Yeah.
meg,Shaky?
sarah,Nope.
meg,Chills?
sarah,Huh uh.
sarah,Don't worry about me.
meg,Hey...
sarah,Go ahead.
sarah,You can do it.
meg,I suggest you leave.
meg,How'd he know that?
meg, Take what you want and get out.
meg,"""What we want is in that room."""
sarah,"They're coming in here, aren't they?"
meg,"No, I told you, they can't.  It's not a possibility."
meg, What do you know about this room?
sarah,Say fuck.
meg, Fuck.
sarah,"""Get the fuck out of my house."""
meg, Get the fuck out of my house!
sarah,Answer.
meg,"Oh, please."
sarah,Give me a break.
burnham,"Got her right where you want her, Junior."
junior,Shut up.
burnham,When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
junior,Shut up and let me think.
burnham,"I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help."
junior," Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?"
raoul,What if she called the cops?
burnham,She didn't.
junior,She said she did.
burnham,"She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones."
raoul,What the fuck is funny about this?
burnham,God.
raoul,There is not one thing funny here.
burnham,"Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony."
junior,"Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?"
burnham,Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
raoul,So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
burnham,"Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room."
junior,And why exactly would they want to come out?
burnham,Workin' on it.
meg,"Hey.  Relax, okay?"
meg,"I mean it, lie down.  You get your adrenaline up and you know what's gonna happen."
sarah,Are you freaking out?
meg,Little bit.  Yeah.
sarah,Small space?
sarah,Why did the chicken cross the road?
meg,"What am I, a five year old?"
sarah,Why did the chicken cross the road?
meg,"I don't know, why?"
sarah,To prove he wasn't chicken.
meg,What the hell are they doing?
meg, ... locking us in...
sarah,Mom?
sarah,Are you okay?
sarah, MOM?!  MOM!!
meg,Not here... not here... someplace else... someplace else...
sarah,THEY'RE COMING IN!  THEY'RE COMING IN!
sarah,YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
meg,I am.  I'm here.
sarah,YOU HAVE TO!
meg,I'm here.  I'm here.
meg,We're fine.  We're okay.
propane,CAUTION - FLAMMABLE
junior,Open it.
burnham,I did.
raoul,He said open it.
burnham,Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
raoul,"We ain't playin', here."
sarah,"What, what, what is it?!"
meg,On the floor!  Get on the floor!
burnham,"Look, don't be stupid..."
junior,Be quiet.
burnham,"We're trying to scare them, not kill them!"
junior,They're coughing.
burnham,They're gonna die in there!
junior,"Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine."
burnham,"Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?"
junior,Cut it back a little bit.
raoul,No fucking way.
junior,"He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!"
burnham,Oh.
burnham,"I'M COMING IN THERE, BITCH, I AM COMING IN THERE!  I AM COMING IN THERE!"
sarah,Neighbor!
raoul, We're gonna talk.  Downstairs.
raoul,You stay.  Make sure she don't come out.
meg,Morse code?
sarah," Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot."
meg,Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
sarah,"""Titanic."""
meg,Got him!
sarah,"Come on, come on..."
meg,"Yes, yes, yes, yes..."
sarah,We're never getting out of here.
meg,Shhh...
junior,"We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine."
raoul,If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
junior,"""Half?""  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating."
raoul,"I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along."
junior,"That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say ""you"" or Raoul,"" got it?"
raoul,He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
junior,"No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?"
raoul,"Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes."
junior,"What is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  You're a bus driver, ""Homes,"" you live in Flatbush, so please don't start spouting some Elmore Leonard shit you just heard because I saw that movie too,"
meg,Damn.
meg,"Oh yes, yes..."
meg,... the hell is he?
sarah,Do it.
meg,"Yeah, but where's the third guy?"
sarah,Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
meg,"If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door."
sarah,No.
meg,Close it!
sarah,WAIT!
burnham,"Oh, hell..."
sarah,GO GO GO!
burnham,"What'd she get, what'd she get, what'd she get..."
burnham,Cell phone.
junior,Shit!
meg,"Oh, no.  No, no, no no no no no..."
meg,"Oh come on, come on, come on..."
burnham, I don't think we'll be talking on our cell phone from in there...
meg,Wires...
burnham,Phone...
meg,... wires.
sarah,What are you doing?
meg,"I saw something, I saw..."
meg,... phone wires!
meg,"I may not have hooked up the phone in here, but I hooked up the main line, and there's a jack at the base of this wall outside, I saw it!"
burnham,"Say, while we're on the subject of phones..."
burnham,"When I said cut the line, did you cut the main line at the junction box in the basement like I said, and which I repeated, or did you just cut the cord on the phone in the kitchen?"
junior,"I, uh, I..."
junior,... hit a little snag finding the one in the basement.
meg,"Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!"
sarah,Blue is phones?
meg,"Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!"
burnham,God damn it!
operator,911 emergency --
meg,I'm at 26 West --
operator,-- please hold.
meg,NO!
meg,Damn it!
sarah,Call Dad!
meg,On it!
voice,Hello?
meg,Listen to me!  There are three --
meg,Hello?  Don't... are...
meg,He'll do something.
sarah,Uh uh.
meg,"He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said ""There are three..."""
sarah,He won't even know who it was.
meg,"What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police."
sarah,Stop it.
meg,"He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us..."
sarah,He --
meg,He WILL.
meg,I'm sorry.
sarah,I'm sorry.
meg,Why?
sarah,I was trying not to tell you...
meg,What?
sarah,I'm dizzy and thirsty.
junior,She's never coming out.
burnham,Hey.
junior,And we're never getting in.
burnham,Do me a favor and don't talk.
junior,"Jesus, what was I thinking?"
meg,"Come on, come on... stay with me... you gotta drink..."
meg,"Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?"
sarah,"I'm dizzy, not deaf."
meg,"Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?"
sarah,Huh uh.
meg,"Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine."
sarah,What if I keep dropping?
meg,Not an option.
sarah,What if I do?
junior,We're leaving.
raoul,The hell we are.
burnham,"Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close."
junior,"Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing."
burnham,What about us?
junior,Here.  For your time.
junior,Five hundred bucks here.
junior,Suit yourself.
raoul,Nobody leaves.
junior,Observe.
burnham,"We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe."
junior,"Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude."
sarah,What if I spazz out?
meg," No biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, I just jab you with the Glucogen."
sarah,Where is the Glucogen?
meg,"Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room."
sarah," I'm sorry, Mom."
meg,"Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?"
sarah,Okay.
burnham,Would you wait?  Would you please just wait a minute?
burnham,You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
junior,"Yeah, whatever."
burnham,I mean it!
junior,Adios.
raoul,Nobody leaves.
burnham,"Oh God... oh, my God..."
raoul,You should see the look on your face.
burnham,The fuck did you do that for?!
raoul,"Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. Drives his German car up to 125th Street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me.  You don't know one thing about me!"
voice,What the h --
burnham,Stop it!  Stop it!
raoul, Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
burnham,Me.  I am.
raoul,That's right.
burnham,Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
raoul,I have the gun.
burnham,Yes.
raoul,Remember that.
burnham,Please...
burnham,What?  What do you want me to do?
raoul,What do you think?  Get us into that room.
burnham,I can't.
raoul,You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
burnham,I can't...
raoul,You got till the count of three. Then you end up like him.
raoul,One.  Squeeze.
burnham,This is ridiculous...
raoul,Two.  Squeeze harder.
burnham,I can't just...
raoul,Th --
burnham,"Okay, okay!  Okay."
raoul,You got an idea?
burnham,"Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something."
burnham,"Okay, look.  I know you can hear me. Your wife and kid are in there. You're gonna get 'em to come out. Or --"
burnham,Or I can't stop what he's gonna do. Do you understand?
burnham,Good.
burnham,OPEN THE GOD DAMN DOOR!
burnham,OPEN UP!
harris,"DON'T DO IT!  NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, DON'T OPEN THE DOOR! DON'T O --"
burnham,"STOP IT, MAN, STOP IT, THAT'S HIS KID IN THERE, HIS KID IS WATCHING THIS!!"
meg,"Oh God, oh my God..."
sarah,"You gotta jab me, Mommy..."
meg,Oh... oh...
burnham, I just... I just need forty-five minutes.
raoul,"Saw my face, man.  Saw my face."
raoul,Shut up.
meg," -- cine, she needs the MEDICINE! GIVE HER THE --"
burnham,"It's gonna be cool, kid.  Be outta here before you know it."
burnham,Are you okay?
raoul,"Hurry up, for Christ's sake!"
burnham,The hell does she want?
raoul,"I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over."
raoul,Drugs.  She wants drugs.  What the fuck?
burnham,"Oh, man..."
burnham,What is it?
sarah,I need...
burnham,Yeah?
sarah,... 'jection...
burnham,An injection?
burnham,That stuff?
burnham,Can you do it yourself?
burnham,"Well, I don't know how."
raoul,I don't fucking believe this.  You gotta wait.
burnham,"Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?"
raoul,"Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour."
raoul,Come on.
burnham,"Tell me the truth, okay?  What's gonna happen if you don't get this?"
sarah,Coma.  Die.
raoul,"You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!"
burnham,Are you gonna open the safe?
burnham,Then shut up and get out of my way.
raoul,Don't look at me.
burnham,"Okay, kid, all I know about this is what I've seen on TV, you gotta talk me through it."
burnham,"Okay.  No talking.  No problem.  TV don't lie, right?"
burnham,"You seem like a good kid.  Your mom... only saw her for a second, but, woah.  Beautiful, huh?"
burnham,"Hey, nod or something, show me you're still alive, will ya?"
burnham,Attagirl.  That too tight?
burnham,"You guys are pretty rich, huh?"
burnham,"Yeah, you don't think about that stuff.  Good for you."
burnham,"I know, I know.  I really screwed the pooch this time.  I never did anything like this before.  Break into somebody's house?  Not even close.  Bad cards, Kid.  I swear to God, I been on the wrong end of maybe six straight years of bad cards.  House.  Car.  Wife.  And you thought you were sick."
burnham,Feel better?
burnham,Woulda been a hell of a dad.
raoul,Congratulations.  You saved her life for ten minutes.
harris,Police.
meg, You called the police?
harris,You... scared...
meg,Don't.  Say.  A word.
raoul,Holy shit... holy shit...
raoul,"She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!"
burnham,"It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us."
burnham,She's gonna handle it.
raoul,She better.
meg,Yeah?
cop 1,Everything okay?
meg,Huh?
cop 2,Are you all right?
meg,What are you guys -- what time is it?
cop 1,'Bout four o'clock.
meg,I don't get it.
cop 2,We got a call...
meg,Somebody called you?
cop 1,Can we come in?
meg,What do you want?
cop 1,We'd like to come in.
meg,"No, you can't come in."
cop 2,Are you okay?
meg,I'm fine.
cop 1,Can we come in?
meg,Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
cop 1,You don't look so good.
meg,"You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?"
cop 1,"Your husband says you said ""There are three..."" right before you got cut off."
meg,"Oh, that phone call..."
cop 1,"Ma'am, if there's something you want to say to us right now that maybe you can't say to us right now, maybe you just want to make a signal, by blinking a few times, something like that."
cop 1,That's something you could do. Safely.
meg,"Man, you are good!  You mean, like, if somebody was in the house or something?  That's great, they really train you guys these days, don't they?"
meg,No.  I'm fine.  Cross my heart.
cop 1,May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
meg, Huh?
cop 1,"The sentence that started ""There are three.""  What was the rest?"
meg,"Okay, look.  My husband and I just broke up.  It's my first night in the new house, and I was feeling a little lonely and a little drunk. The sentence, if you insist on knowing, was going to be ""There are three things I'll do for you if you come over right now and get in bed with me."""
meg,"But thank God I came to my senses before I said all that and hung up instead, so nobody would ever know what I was thinking, unless, of course, two policemen showed up in the middle of the night to interrogate me about it."
cop 2,"You want her to show you which three things, Rick, or should we just go?"
raoul,She saw my face.  The kid too.
burnham,That's your problem.
raoul,That's their problem.
burnham,Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.

burnham,Bullshit.
raoul,You know how this gotta end.
meg,Fourteen.
meg,"No camera, no camera, no camera..."
raoul,Hey!
sarah,Sorry.  Can't control it sometimes.

neighbor,"What the hell do you think you're doing, young lady?!"
raoul,"The walls are steel, right?"
burnham,Not that one.
raoul,NOT THAT ONE?!
burnham,"Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!"
burnham,WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
raoul,We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
burnham,"She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to bring a gun for?!"
burnham,Almost there...
burnham,ALMOST THERE...
burnham,JESUS!
burnham,"I GOT THE MONEY, LET'S GO!!!"
burnham,"GO, LET'S GO, OUTTA HERE!!"
raoul,YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
burnham,"FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!"
cop 1,Put your hands up.
burnham,Monster hand.
sarah,"I mean, uptown is close to Dad's place, but somebody at school said the Village is really cool, so... I don't know, it's so great to be close to the park and everything... What do you think, I mean, give me a clue, here, where are we gonna live?"
