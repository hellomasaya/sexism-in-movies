Speaker,Dialogue
david," Take trust, for instance, or friendship: these are the important things in life, the things that matter, that help you on your way. If you can't trust your friends, well, what then?"
david, This could have been any city: they're all the same.
cameron,"Hello, I've come about the room."
alex,What's his name?
david,I don't know -- Campbell or something?
juliet,Cameron.
alex,Cameron?
juliet,Yes.
alex, Really?
cameron,That's right.
alex, What?
alex," Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?"
cameron,"Yes, thanks."
alex,"Good. Well, you've seen the flat?"
cameron,Yes.
alex,And you like it?
cameron,"Oh, yes, it's great."
alex,"Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?"
cameron,Yes.
alex,"Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap."
cameron,"Well, yes."
alex,"So tell me, Cameron, what on earth -- just tell me, because I want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you?"
alex," And, Cameron -- I mean this -- good luck!"
alex, Do you think he was upset?
alex," David likes to keep spareshoelaces in sorted pairs in a box marked, not just shoelaces', but spare shoelaces'."
woman,I've come to see about the room.
juliet," Alex is a vegetarian. Do you know why? Because he feels it provides an interesting counterpoint to his otherwise callous personality. It doesn't. He thinks he's the man for me. He isn't, though there was a time when, well, there was a time when..."
goth,I've come about the room.
david," Like one of those stupid posters -- you know, a gorilla cuddling a hedgehog, caption love hurts --- that's what I think when I think of Juliet."
man,I've come about the room.
david,"All right, just a few questions."
alex,I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
juliet,Why do you want a room here?
david,Do you smoke?
alex,"When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?"
juliet,"I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?"
david,"Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?"
alex,Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
juliet,"Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not."
david,"OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band."
alex,"When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?"
juliet,"Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?"
david,"Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?"
alex,"With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?"
juliet,"It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that."
david,Did you ever kill a man?
alex,And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
juliet,"OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love."
david,And what if I told you that I was the antichrist?
alex,Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
david,Serve.
alex,I was trying to educate you.
david,Just serve.
alex,In the same fashion as chess.
david,What?
alex,Chess. Chess is often used as well.
david,Will you shut up and play.
alex,You're a bad loser.
david,I haven't lost yet.
alex,"Defeat, defeat, defeat-- sporting,personal, financial, professional, sexual, everything. Next."
alex,Did you know --
juliet,Just serve.
alex,I wasn't trying to win.
alex," I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win."
david,Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
alex,You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
david,"Discussion group, Alex, discussion."
juliet,I thought you stopped going.
alex,"Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that."
alex," God, you two are sensitive. All I'm doing is implying some sort of sordid, ugly, sexual liason. Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing."
juliet,"Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful."
alex,For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
juliet,For the flat.
alex,"No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry."
juliet,She hated you --
alex,"Well, she had problems --"
juliet,-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
alex,"-- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?"
juliet,You must be Hugo.
hugo,You must be Juliet.
juliet,Would you like to come in?
hugo,I'd be delighted.
hugo,It's nice.
juliet,Would you like to see the rest?
juliet,What do you do?
hugo,"Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel."
juliet,What's it about?
hugo,A priest who dies.
juliet,I see.
hugo,"Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it."
juliet,No.
hugo,"Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already."
juliet,Writing seems easy.
hugo,It's a breeze.
juliet,Do you think you could answer that?
hugo,The telephone? It continues to ring.
juliet,"Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in."
juliet,No.
hugo,All right.
hugo,"Hello. Yes. Who's calling please? Well, I'm sorry, but she's not in right now. I don't know. Would you like to leave a message?"
hugo, It was some guy called Brian.
juliet,Did he sound upset?
hugo,A little bit. Is that good or bad?
juliet,It's an improvement.
hugo,Shall I answer it?
juliet,"No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week."
hugo,Working nights?
juliet,I'm a doctor.
hugo,And he's a patient of yours?
juliet,No. But he needs treatment.
hugo,For what?
juliet,A certain weakness.
hugo,The human condition.
juliet,You know about it?
hugo,I write about it?
juliet,And that's not the same thing?
hugo,"No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self."
alex,"Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things."
juliet,"He seemed like a nice guy, Alex."
alex,"I'm not saying he didn't seem like a nice guy. All I'm saying is, it's a bit strange, and this search for the self, and what he's on about, you know."
juliet," He didn't seem strange, Alex.He seemed, you know --"
juliet,...interesting.
alex,Interesting. Interesting.
alex,"Hello. No, she's not in. No. No. No. No ideas."
juliet, Who was it?
alex,I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
alex, What do you think?
david,About what?
alex,"About this guy, this Hugo person."
david,I don't have time.
alex,I'm only asking what you think.
david,I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
alex,"This is for you. It's your mother's handwriting, so I didn't open it. I don't like reading about your father's constipation."
juliet," So we'll meet him, then?"
alex,"What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'"
alex, Aroused and inflamed.
juliet,Alex.
alex,"He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't."
alex,Interesting.
hugo,I see.
alex,"Yeah, well, that's what she said. Interesting. That's why you're here, you see."
david,"Normally I don't meet people, unless I know them already."
hugo,I see.
david,People can be so cruel.
alex,"So, uh..."
hugo,What?
alex,What?
hugo,You were going to say something.
alex,"What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right?"
juliet,"Just get on with it, Alex."
david,"Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now."
alex,We think it's fine.
alex, It's OK. There's no problem.
hugo,You mean I can have the room?
alex,"Well, that's what I said, isn't it?"
david,He made it clear.
alex,"Why, thank you, David."
juliet,"Yes, you can have the room."
alex,I'm not usually drunk.
juliet,Not usually this drunk.
david,Only on expenses.
alex,It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
juliet,In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
alex,"It was you, Juliet, it was you --"
juliet,-- instead of what he is --
alex,What I am.
juliet,-- which is --
alex,-- which is a hack.
juliet,The man we know and love.
alex,"A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet."
alex, Know and love?
juliet,Yeah.
alex,I think you're lying.
juliet,You're right.
alex,"You see, they don't really know me."
juliet,"No, Alex, we don't really love you."
alex,Can you afford this place?
hugo,Yeah.
david,Can I ask you a question?
hugo,Certainly.
david,Have you ever killed a man? HUGO No.
david,"Well, that's fair enough, then."
alex,Certainly smells like the real thing.
juliet,Have you seen Hugo?
alex,No. Any idea which channel he's on?
alex,"No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work."
alex, Have you seen him?
david,"Alex, I don't have the time --"
alex,"Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --"
david,No.
alex,David hasn't seen him either.
juliet,So I gathered.
alex,Maybe he didn't like us.
juliet,David?
alex,Hugo.
juliet,His car's still there.
alex,He's got a car?
juliet,So what's wrong with that?
alex,What sort of car?
juliet,"Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl."
alex,"I will ask you once more, what sort of car --"
juliet,"A blue one, OK. And it's still there."
alex,"Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again."
juliet,"Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side."
alex,So?
juliet,Open it.
alex,You want me to kick it open?
juliet,Yes.
alex,Now?
juliet,Yes.
alex,All right. No problem.
alex, You want a go?
david,Is this what they always look like?
juliet,Yes.
alex,I wonder how he did it?
juliet,Did what?
alex,I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
juliet,Alex.
alex,What? What's wrong?
juliet,What are you doing?
alex,I'm just looking.
juliet,Don't.
alex,Don't look?
juliet,No.
alex,"Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?"
juliet,No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
alex,It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
juliet,"Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse."
alex,"Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet."
david,I've never seen a dead body before.
juliet,"Alex, I think it's time for you to stop."
david,"I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time."
alex,Can I show you something?
operator,"Hello, emergency services."
david,No.
alex,Think about it.
david,No.
alex,"Come on, David."
david,No.
alex,Juliet?
juliet,"No, Alex. It's, it's --"
alex,What?
juliet,Unfeasible.
alex,Is that all?
david,You mean immoral.
alex,I'm only asking you both to think about it.
david,"It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick."
alex,But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
david,You think so?
alex," All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it."
alex,"Now, was there a pet in the house? Yes, a pet, like a dog or a budgie or a gerbil. You see, what I need is PC Plod rescues Harry the Hamster from House of Horror'. All right... well, that's a pity, you see, no pets, no human angle."
doctor,"Hi, there."
juliet,Hello.
doctor,What happened to that guy?
juliet,What guy?
doctor,"That guy, the one that died."
juliet,What guy that died?
doctor,"That one, last week."
juliet,Here?.
doctor,"Yeah, here, I mean, where else?"
juliet,"Oh, him. Well, he died."
doctor, That's what I thought.
lumsden,"What do we do here, David?"
david,Sorry?
lumsden,Here.
david,Right here?
lumsden,In this firm.
david,"Well, it's a wide range of, eh --"
lumsden,"Accounting, David, chartered accounting --"
david,Exactly what I was --
lumsden,-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
david,"Not any real sneering as such, no."
lumsden,"There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?"
david,Eh --
lumsden,"But they sneer, don't they?"
david,I'm not sure --
lumsden,"Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done."
david,"Yes, sir."
lumsden,And that's why I think you fit in here.
david,I'm boring?
lumsden,You get the job done.
david,"Oh, I see, I thought you meant --"
lumsden,Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
david,He's still here.
alex,He couldn't get his car started.
david,When are you going to let the police know?
alex,You call them if you want.
david, And what about you?
juliet,"Well, I'm getting used to having him around."
david, OK. Let's do it.
alex," All right, now listen. We have to dispose of the body in such a way as to make it unidentifiable, so that even if it is found, then it's never anything more than an unknown corpse. Burning, dumping at sea, and straightforward burial are all flawed either by fingerprints, or, more commonly, by dental records. This I have learned. Now, what I suggest is that we bury him out in the forest, but first of all we remove his hands and his feet, which we incinerate. And his teeth, which we just remove. It's as simple as that."
alex, I always wondered what these were for.
alex, Now this is what we need. And this.
alex, Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
alex,"A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit."
david,So who's going to do it?
alex,"Dig the pit, I don't know."
david,"No, not that."
alex,Then what? Who's going to do what?
david,You know what I'm talking about.
alex,Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
david,You know what. Who's going to do it.
alex,"We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?"
david,I can't do it.
alex,I don't hear this.
david,I won't be able to.
alex,You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
david,I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
juliet,Who's going to do it?
alex,I thought we all were.
juliet,I don't thinkI can.
alex,But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
juliet,I don't want to. It's different.
alex,And now you tell me.
david,There's something I want to ask.
man,"I don't know. I swear to God, I don't know."
alex," Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David."
david,I just thought we should discuss it.
alex,Take his legs.
andy,You stupid bastard.
alex,Why don't we just draw lots for it?
alex," Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing."
juliet,OK.
alex,David?
david,I don't know.
alex,"Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't."
alex,"All right, then, here we are and this is it. Do you want to play or not?"
david,I can't do it.
david,Finished.
alex,But not quite.
david,Is that going to be deep enough?
alex,Don't you worry about that.
david,Is this necessary?
alex,"Yes. Now come on, all or nothing."
juliet,Are you all right?
david," Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine."
juliet,Would you like to talk about it?
david,No.
juliet,Be careful.
alex,"Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?"
juliet,Stop nagging.
alex, I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
mc,"Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please. First of all, may I thank you all for coming along tonight and supporting our appeal to raise funds for the sick children's unit."
alex,You didn't tell me that this was for children. I hate children. I'd raise money to have the little fuckers put down.
juliet,Sshh.
alex,I want my money back. Excuse me.
mc,"For all too often there's a complacency: out of sight, out of mind, let someone else bother about these things."
mc," But just before the dancing, I'd like to say a special thank-you to a few of the people who've worked so very hard to make this occassion happen."
david,Do you know many of these people?
juliet,Yes. They're my friends.
alex,"I see, so if they want to talk to you, we say you're not in."
mc,"And now, ladies and gentlemen, and those of you who are neither or both --"
mc, -- would you make your way to the floor for Strip the Willow.
juliet,Are we going to dance?
alex,"Well, it's physical contact, isn't it?"
alex,That was good.
david,Can we talk about something?
alex,Not now. I have an idea.
david,"Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --"
alex,Just stop worrying.
alex, Love and happiness for ever.
juliet,For ever and ever.
alex,What's the problem?
david,I want to talk now.
alex,After you drink to love and happiness forever.
david,Now.
alex,After.
juliet,"David, I promise we will. Keep him happy."
alex,It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
alex, Look over there. It's Cameron.
juliet,Who?
alex,Cameron. You remember Cameron.
juliet,"No, I don't."
alex,What's he doing here?
juliet,That's not him.
alex,"Yes, it is. It's him. Cameron, Cameron, come on over.Yo!"
cameron,What?
alex,Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
alex," Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?"
david,"Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --"
brian, The divine Juliet. Long time no see.
juliet,Brian.
brian,Would you care to dance?
david,Hold on there. Who do you think you are?
brian,What?
david,Who do you think you are? You interrupted us.
brian,"I'm Brian McKinley, and who are you?"
david,"Well, Brian McKinley, if you want to talk to my girlfriend, you talk to me first. If you want to dance with her, then you apply in writing three weeks in advance or you're gonna end up insode a fucking bin-bag. You didn't apply, so you don't dance."
juliet,Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
david,I'm sorry.
juliet,It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
david,That was stressful. I found that stressful.
alex,"Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there."
david,You think so?
juliet,"Well, you certainly had a good look around."
alex,You were magnificent.
alex,Cameron! What a surprise.
juliet,Hello. Hello.
alex,Who was it?
juliet,"Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing."
juliet,Are you all right?
alex,No.
juliet,Then let's spend some money.
alex,"Hello. It's been a struggle, but now the days of worry are over, the light at the end of the tunnel has expanded into a golden sunrise and at last, at long last, nothing will ever be the same again."
alex," This is Alex Law reporting from the scene of his own life, and you know, I'm so happy I could die."
david,"I think we ought to scrub this, don't you?"
alex,Will you calm down.
juliet,"Yeah, you're making us all nervous."
david,How much did you pay?
alex,I don't know.
david,How much did you pay?
alex,I don't know.
david,How much?
alex,I don't know.
juliet,Two hundred.
david,Two hundred pounds?
juliet,Two hundred pounds.
david,You paid two hundred pounds for this?
juliet,"That's what it cost, David."
david,"No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet."
david,Did they take anything? Did they take anything?
alex,What is this? What is going on? David!
david,I'll let you in.
alex,What is this?
david,Security.
david,From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
david,There was a break-in.
alex,"Downstairs, I know. Pensioner's terror ordeal: page six."
david,Doesn't it worry you?
alex,"No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me."
alex," What's all this for, more security?"
david,I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
alex,"Oh, that'll come in useful."
juliet,Is this the same stuff you made last week?
alex,"No, no, it's different."
juliet,I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
alex,It tastes different.
juliet,I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
david,"What? Yes, that's fine."
alex,You're sure? There's lots more.
david,"No, I'm sure, that'll be enough."
alex,What's wrong?
david,Nothing.
alex,You're not eating.
david,Not eating what?
alex,"Not eating like you used to, that's what."
david,"If you give me the plate, I'll eat."
alex,Now swallow.
alex," You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice."
juliet,He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
alex,Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
juliet,Be like a weight off your shoulders.
alex,You know we're right.
juliet,Don't you?
david,I want to secure it.
alex,"Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?"
juliet,I don't see the point in that.
alex,"Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --"
david,"Yeah, and you didn't saw his feet off."
david, It tastes different.
alex," David, David, what are you doing up there?"
alex, Will you come down now. It's not safe up there. Are you listening to me. Security and insanity are not the same thing.
alex,Shit.
juliet,Leave him alone.
alex,He can't stay up there.
juliet,He'll come down. Leave him alone.
alex,"Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?"
juliet,"No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?"
alex,Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
david,"It's my mother, sir, she's very ill and I think I need to be with her just now. I don't know. The doctors aren't sure. It could go either way. Yes, sir, I'll certainly stay in touch."
juliet,Painful groin? What does that mean?
sister,I don't know. He wouldn't show me.
juliet,What are you doing here?
alex,We have to talk.
juliet,Your painful groin?
alex,Later. But first -- him.
juliet,David?
alex,Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
juliet,"Oh, good."
alex,"He won't do anything for me, but for you --"
juliet,Forget it.
alex,"He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe."
juliet,And the money?
alex,We could put it somewhere.
juliet,Where he can't get it?
alex,"Now you thought of that, not me."
juliet,Forget it -- he'll come down.
alex,Expecting anyone?
juliet,No.
alex,Oh.
juliet,Aren't you going to answer it?
alex,"Well, I'm not expecting anyone either."
alex,It's in the loft.
salesman,"October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five."
juliet,That sounds fine.
salesman,"Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?"
juliet,What?
salesman,"Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you."
juliet,"Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct."
salesman,"It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot is variable."
juliet,The first one was fine.
salesman,"Well, it's up to you. Seven six five. How will you be paying?"
alex,"No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further."
juliet,It's the only way.
alex,I refuse.
juliet,You're frightened.
alex,"No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up."
mccall,Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
david,What about?
mccall,It's about the burglary.
david,Burglary?
mccall,Downstairs.
david,Of course.
mccall,Can we come in?
david,"So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think."
mccall,did you hear anything before he cries?
david,"No, not that I recall, I was asleep."
mccall,Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
david,"No, nothing, sorry."
mccall,"Well, if you do, you'll let us know?"
david,Of course.
mccall,"And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?"
david,There are only two other people in the flat.
mccall,Two?
david,Who said there were four?
mccall,"We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four."
david,"No, three. Who said there were four?"
mccall,How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
david,"Yes, absolutely."
mccall,"Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?"
mitchell,"Both, sir."
mccall,"Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade."
david,I see.
mccall,"I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?"
david,"No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up."
mccall,Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
david,I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
mccall,Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
david,Someone lost the key.
mccall,Is this where no one stays?
david,"Yeah, that's right, that's it."
alex,You'll wait in the hall?
juliet,I'll wait there.
alex,"And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?"
juliet,Everything.
alex,Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
juliet,Alex.
alex,What?
juliet,"As smart as you are, you'll need a little help."
alex,"All right, David, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to open this lock and I'm going to come up, and what's important is that you remain calm."
alex,He isn't up here.
david,Tell him to look for the money.
juliet,Look for the money.
alex,"Don't worry, that's what I'm doing."
david,Expecting anyone?
juliet,What?
david,Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
juliet,No.
david,Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
juliet,No one. I promise.
david,Who have you talked to?
juliet,No one.
david,If I think you're lying --
alex," Well, it's not up here."
alex,"Juliet, I have --"
alex, -- a problem.
david,You looking for me?
alex,Looking for you? Yes.
david,What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
alex,We just wanted to speak to you.
david,Who else have you wanted to speak to? Maybe you thought they'd already got me.
alex,Who?
david,Your friends.
alex,I don't know what you're talking about.
juliet,He doesn't know David.
david,"Well, maybe you don't --"
david, I'm talking about the police.
david,I thought you'd gone to work.
juliet, With a face like this?
office boy,The editor wants to see you.
juliet,"I remember how things used to be here, and I see how they are now, and I don't know why it is. I don't know how we let you become like this. We were your friends and we should have looked after you."
editor,Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
alex,I don't know anything about it.
editor,"Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it."
alex,Cover it?
editor,Well?
alex,But there's no --
editor,"Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short."
alex,I don't know.
editor,Don't know what?
alex,"Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?"
david,I'm sorry.
juliet,I should hope so.
david,Maybe we can still sort everything out.
juliet,We can try.
uniformed officer,"All right, ladies and gentlemen, the releasable and print-worthy facts of the day so far are as follows. Late yesterdat afternoon, forestry workers came across one set of human remains lying in a grave which appeared to have been recently dug. Further excavation on our part has revealed two similar, deeper graves, again containing human remains."
uniformed officer," As and when the corpses are removed, we will endeavour to ascertain the mode of death and duration of burial, as well as identification, which will of course be passed on to you after informing, where possible, the next of kin."
