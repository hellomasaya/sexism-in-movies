Speaker,Dialogue
"december 21, 2009",INT. A BLACK SCREEN
lindy,I don't think I can keep this.
eddie,Just like that.
lindy,"If I didn't care, maybe I'd be able to stand to watch you do this."
eddie,"Look, I'm going to give 90 pages to Mark on Friday. If you could just wait, see what he says-"
lindy,"Stop. You think I don't know what you do all day? I've loved you. I know the good stuff, and I know the shit."
eddie,And it's all shit to you now?
lindy,You're the one living it.  Don't think I don't know it's worse for you.
eddie,Then you know I could use a friend.
lindy,Don't you dare try that shit on me!
eddie,"Well -- what'll work, then?"
lindy,I see where it's going. You'll lose your apartment. And then what? You'll move in with me--
eddie,Not with that enthusiastic invite--
lindy,"--And then it'll go on this way, and I'll rag on you, and finally boot you out -- and then what? I mean, have you run the film?"
lindy,You know what...? I'd have had you move in anyway... if...
eddie,"If, what?"
lindy,If it was me you wanted. And not Melissa.
eddie,I never think about Melissa--!
lindy,I have to get back.
eddie,"--Hey, well -- wait -- you didn't tell me what happened yesterday."
lindy,I got it.
eddie,You got it--?!
lindy,Yeah. I'll have my own assistant. You believe that?
eddie," You deserve it, Lindy."
lindy,"Yeah, thanks. I do."
voice,Eddie. Morgan.
vernon,Shit! It's gotta be-- 9 years--?
eddie,But who's counting.
vernon," Hey, you!!!"
eddie,"Sedentary job, you know..."
vern,So you're still trying to write?
eddie,"As a matter of fact, I've got a book contract."
vernon, Do I look like I'm still dealing?
eddie,No.
vernon,"Come on, let's get a drink. I wanna hear about this book."
eddie,"Nah, I should go--"
vern,"You can't tell me you're a health nut, now. Not with that tire-"
eddie, Enticing invitation. Thanks.
vern,"C'mon, c'mon, one beer. Or I won't give `em back."
eddie,"It's one o'clock in the afternoon, Vern."
vern,When's that ever stopped you?
eddie, Fuck.
eddie,So... how's Melissa?
vernon,Ah-hah. That's why you agreed to the beer.
eddie,"I'm making conversation, Vern."
vernon,"Well, I don't know how Melissa is."
eddie,How don't you know? You're her brother.
vernon,"I don't see her. She lives upstate now, she's got some kinda internet home sales kinda job... a couple of kids..."
eddie,A couple of kids...
eddie,Who's the husband?
vernon,"What are you, jealous?"
eddie,"It's just a question, Vern."
vernon,"Walked out on her, if you really want to know. But what do you care? You guys weren't even married six months, were you--? I mean, it was just a coke thing, right?"
eddie,"Is that what she said--?! ""A coke thing."""
vernon,But I wanna know about this book. How's it going?
eddie," How's it going... Well... I'm behind. I'm behind on my book, and it's pretty well polluting my days and nights if you really want to know."
vernon,How much have you written of it?
eddie,"Not one fucking word, Vern."
vernon,"Wow. Creative problem, huh?"
eddie,"Oh, no-- no, no, no-"
vernon,You don't even know what it is.
eddie,You're still dealing.
vernon,No -- yeah --will you listen?! This isn't recreational. I've been doing some consulting for a PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY--
eddie,You mean a lab in some little Yalie's basement? Give me a--
vernon,"No, this is an exclusive product coming on-stream next year, they've had clinical trials, and it's FDA approved."
eddie,"Okay, what is it?"
vern,Just take it. Get you over the hump.
eddie,"I'm too old for this, Vernon."
vernon,"Look, they've identified these receptors in the brain that activate specific circuits, and-- you know how they say you can only access like 20 percent of your brain? Well, what this does--"
eddie,"Vernon. Look at me. Do I look good? I smoke too much: my chest is sore. A fucking corpse has more energy than I do, I've got weird aches, possible lumps, rashes, maybe they're a condition, or a network of conditions. One of these days they're all going to hold hands, light up, and I'll keel over dead. My life's in the crapper, and I DON'T think it's going to take a sudden upswing into the stratosphere if I do some brand new, shiny designer DRUG!"
vern, Tell him we can't do that. He knows that's out of the question. We absolutely can't do that.
eddie,"I don't want it, Vern."
vern,"Don't be ungrateful, now. You know how much these things cost?"
melissa,"--Oh, please, you think professional women mentor one another? You think there's some mutually supportive empathetic touch-feely network of kindly pie- bakers? --Those bitches hate each other! Quick, who was the worst boss you ever had? A woman, right?! We can't delegate, we can't command -- I mean, there's a reason we're not generals--!"
valerie,"Look, enough, okay--?"
eddie,Just tell him-
valerie,Steve handles the rents. So feed your fucking bullshit to him.
valerie,--Like the rent's not low enough--!
valerie,You could be a bike messenger and come up with that!
valerie,"--Look, I'm just telling you, he's been talking about calling these people he knows from the club to muscle you out -- I've told him not to do that, but he's really pissed."
valerie,W-What?
eddie,"""I was blind but now I see."""
valerie,"Look, that's none of your-"
eddie,Something wrong at school?
valerie,How do you know I'm in school!
eddie,"People who aren't don't usually carry dry, academic constipated out of print books about Dorothea Lange."
valerie,Are you some kind of creep? Have you been following me?!
eddie,I just saw the book--
valerie,You can only see a corner of it. How did you know?
eddie,I've seen it before.
valerie,"Well, who asked y-"
eddie,"Cal Berkeley has her oral history. I'd start there. Her son is still alive. You could Google him. Sons of famous people always want to dish dirt about their parents. You'd get something no one else has, and you'd've gone the extra mile, a nice little apple for the professor."
mark,You're kidding.
eddie,No.
mark, Words have appeared on paper.
eddie,Yes.
mark sutton,Written by you.
eddie,"Three pages. That's all you have to read. If you read them in the next hour, and you don't want to keep reading I'll give back the advance."
vern's voice, Yeah?
eddie,Vern! It's Eddie.
vern's voice,"Bad time, okay--?"
eddie,"Vern -- last night 90 pages just wrote themselves! I totally chucked the novel I pitched them --I suddenly SAW, Vern, how this whole societal economic class struggle -- and its solution -- didn't have to be futuristic or fictional -- it was actually ACHIEVABLE here, in our lifetime -- and I could just lay it out, like, like a manifesto, or something, like Mein Kampf except not by a crazy racist fuck!  Okay, I won't talk any more about this if you let me in."
vern,"Well, that was fast."
eddie,WHAT HAP-
vern,Don't ask.
eddie,Yeah. That stuff's amazing.
vernon,It works better if you're already smart.
eddie,VERN-
vern,You don't want to know.
eddie,What's... um... what's it called?
vern,"It doesn't have a street name yet, because it doesn't have a street profile. And that's the way we want it to stay. The boys in the kitchen"
eddie,"""The boys in the kitchen...?"" Vern, that doesn't sound FDA approved."
vern,"""FDA-approved,"" that's a laugh. Did you really believe that shit?"
vern,So you want some more of it?
eddie,Yes. Definitely.
vern,We'll talk about it. But first maybe you can do me a little favor.
eddie,Uh... sure.
vern,"You can see, I'm in no shape to go out right now. Will you hop down to the dry cleaners and get my suit? And maybe pick me up a little breakfast...?"
eddie,Yes... I... I need to report a murder. Eddie. Morgan. --Edward J. I won't.
eddie,At least you got your last meal.
cop,Let me see your hands.
eddie,Heyheyhey! I'm the one that called you!
eddie,"... No, ex-wife's brother. I just ran into him on the street and he invited me up to, you know..."
detective,Buy some drugs?
eddie,Wha-- No! Talk! What're you --
detective,"Okay, fine, what did this guy do?"
eddie,"He was -- I don't know, I heard he was sort of an antiques dealer."
detective,A dealer?
eddie,"Yeah... of, uh... Viennese kind of... chairs... sort of curlicue leg kind of things--"
detective, Yeah. That is correct. An Edward Morgan. He's here.
eddie,Melissa?
melissa's voice,Eddie. You were there?
melissa's voice,God.  This is all so weird...
eddie,Melissa --you don't think I had anything to do with-
melissa,"No, no, no, Eddie, I know that. I wish I was more surprised. He was... involved in some stuff... I better not say any more."
eddie,"Not on this line, no."
melissa's voice,"Eddie, I've got to do the funeral. And God knows what else. I just... we can't meet, okay?"
eddie,Then... I'll see you at the funeral.
melissa,"No. I don't want that - please don't... I'll call you at some point, when this is over. Okay?"
eddie,Okay.
melissa's voice,Okay.
detective,Something doesn't jell here.
eddie,...enabled me to finish the book in four days.
eddie,Learned to read music in a week...
beautiful woman,--is prosaic. Yes.
eddie,Which means a prosaic author's work rests on a foundation of acclaim-
beautiful woman,OR ZEITGEIST-
eddie,"So you're saying praise and fame are unrelated to achievement, that the greatest hits CD cannot possibly contain good songs? That Shakespeare's catchiness belies mediocrity?"
beautiful woman,I...
eddie,"Well, then I'd guess you'd rather not hear about what I, personally, think could launch a thousand ships?"
eddie,"...so, Mom, your 401 K is totally mis-invested -- these guys are have done ONLY the most Pliocine era fundamental analysis and paid no attention to eye candy psychology surrounding the stock --  CDS's? CDO's CBO's?"
eddie,"--Sure you get a short term spike, but wouldn't that rapid expansion devalue the stock completely in two years?"
kevin doyle,"No, no, there are safeguards--"
eddie,"Against aggressive over-expansion? There aren't, because there are no safeguards in human nature."
kevin doyle, Yeah. It'll all happen again.
eddie,"Hey, I want in on it!"
kevin doyle,"You must have a portfolio, but if you don't, I'd be very interested in working with you."
eddie,Thank you so much.
dunham,"Well... sit down, we'll be discussing that."
mark sutton,"First, ah... I want to apologize, Eddie, if I in any way communicated a lack of faith in your abilities."
dunham,What would you say to ten thousand more and another forty down the road?
eddie, This isn't going to work.
dunham,What's not going to work? The money?
mark sutton,"Eddie, we take you very seriously as a writer."
eddie,"Yes, but I now see that writing, as a profession, is for marginalized whiners not fit for anything else."
dunham,You don't think a best-selling author would disagree?
eddie,"Oh, if you're good, there's some remuneration, eventually, after paperbacks, but at best your career'll be oozing along like a snail, a few thousand more copies, whoop-dee-doo, you're ""developing a readership,"" -- for what? So you can end up in Phoenix on a Saturday night reading from your own work at some holdout indie book store to a bored audience of ten? --Half of them there for the wine and cheese?"
mark sutton,"Yes, but if your goal is to have a VOICE-"
eddie," I don't think any goal will be really achievable, Mark, until I'm sitting on a large pile of cash."
day trader,"You've got your quantitive analysis - ""quants..."" Algorhythms to find minute price discrepancies... you're looking at numbers only. Price and volume patterns..."
eddie,"Armed with Vern's last 800 dollars, I made 4000 in a day.  It was too slow."
eddie,Why not?
gennady,Because I don't see you before. And I don't fucking like you already. Why do I give you 100 thousand dollars?
eddie,Because I quintupled my money four days in a row.
gennady,You're lucky.
eddie,It's not luck.
gennady,"Okay, you tricked their computer, you got some fix on the game."
eddie,You think?
gennady,So you're a crook.
eddie,And that's a problem for you because--?
gennady,You people all get caught.
eddie,I won't. And what if I do? You think I keep detailed records of my investors? You'll have your money back long before they figure out what happened.
gennady,"Okay, you take this... you mine. You don't pay, you know what we do? We cut you around the waist, peel your skin, pull it up over your head and tie knot in it. And you don't die from that. You suffocate."
eddie,But not for the big fat defense contract he bribed his way into. That's still on. Should be announced in a week.
eddie's machine,You have... 19 messages.
female voice,"Listen, return my call, Mr. Morgan, this article's about you's gonna get written with or without your cooperation... "
gennady's voice,"...you stupid shit, I be there Thursday for the money, ten o'clock!"
lindy,Carl Van Loon wants to meet you?
eddie,Apparently he does.
lindy,But you're not in the finance game. What can you do for Carl Van Loon?  Eddie-- I --
eddie,Self-improvement month. Someone gave me a wake-up call.
lindy,"God, Eddie -- I felt so bad about that."
eddie,"Why? It stuck, didn't it?"
lindy,You didn't do all this for me.
eddie,Who says I didn't? So what -- it's not getting over? Is that it?
lindy,"All right, all right -- boy, you are really begging for it."
eddie,Begging for what.
lindy,"""I'm proud of you."""
eddie,Gosh. This is so unexpected.
lindy,I'm actually... more than proud. I'm a little...
lindy,"What are you doing, hon?"
eddie,Nothing.
lindy,"What, you think somebody's watching?"
eddie,No.
lindy,"Is there anything you want to tell me, Eddie? Now's the time."
eddie,With success comes enemies.
lindy,Old Chinese proverb?
eddie,No proverb. An inevitability.
lindy,You should sleep. Isn't your Van Loon meeting tomorrow?
lindy,Are you all right?
linda,When was the last time you ate something?
kevin,Hey.
eddie,"I'm eating, Kevin."
kevin,You up for this? You sure? Because I've got a little bit on the line HERE-
eddie,Have a toast point.
van loon,So. Eddie Morgan.
eddie,Medication. I'm on special medication.
eddie,"--Yes, that's partially what I'm SAYING--"
pierce, Pattern recognition. Please.
eddie," Of course, not everyone can understand the patterns."
pierce,Until they weren't.
eddie,"Same rules, even in a panic. It's not understanding how companies work. It's understanding how mass psychology works."
pierce, And you have a formula.
kevin," Well, from 12 thousand to two point eight million in ten days--"
eddie,"Yes. I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce."
pierce, Delusions of grandeur.
eddie,I don't have delusions of grandeur.
kevin,"..and, oh, you know, she's on the wait list... Rosemary's pretty devastated..."
van loon,My daughter went there. I'll call the school for you.
van loon,"I don't know who you are, Eddie, or what your game is, but I'm sure of one thing: you don't work in this business. I'm up to my ass in investment guys, and you don't have their half-cocky, half-terrified line of bullshit. Which is not to say I like yours any better."
eddie,"But these companies aren't the question, are they?"
van loon,What do you mean?
eddie,Well -- you're upmarket energy -- what do you want with these little solar/windmill/hippie outfits?
van loon,Have you been talking to somebody-?
eddie,"Carl, it's just rationalization."
van loon,You are either an amazing con artist or a very smart young man.
eddie,Come on -- the two of you together? The world would have to come to you begging for energy like Oliver Twist with his little bowl of gruel.
van loon,You realize that if the press got one whisper of -- I can't fucking believe I'm even discussing this--
eddie,It doesn't matter. It won't come off.
van loon,"The word ""brazen"" does not even begin to go there."
eddie,You'd have to back off Libya.
van loon,Why? He's come this far--
eddie,I don't think you'd want to hear about it from some shmuck who needs a ride home.
van loon,"You're a gusty little prick, Eddie."
eddie,Ooh. Now you're curious.
van loon,Yeah. I must admit. You've hit a couple pretty big buttons. Go on. Tell me what you think.
eddie, It's getting late.
van loon,"All right. You get your shot. Come to my office, tomorrow at ten, and tell me just exactly how the schmuck who needs the ride would re- structure this deal."
eddie,I'm at your disposal.
van loon,You don't really live here...?
eddie,The Spartans weren't big on amenities.
van loon,Yeah. And they eventually got their asses kicked.
kevin,Hello--? Eddie--? What are you talking about?
eddie,"I can't make the meeting, I'm, uh... I'm sick."
kevin,"Yeah, well, you can't have the fucking flu right now -- he'll never give you this chance again!"
eddie,"I need to, ah, analyze this data-"
kevin,... Don't you get it?! This is your test--!
eddie,"Well, I can't pass a fucking test right now!"
kevin,And how am I going to look if you don't?
eddie,"Okay, Kevin. Okay."
van loon,What do you know about Hank Atwood?
eddie,"Uh... iconoclast... owns, um, a lot of Colorado..."
van loon,"Uh-huh. So this is ""prepared,"" Eddie?"
eddie,"What is this, Atwood 101? Everyone knows about Atwood."
van loon,Where was he two years ago?
eddie,Nowhere.
van loon,Two years ago Forbes didn't even have him on the radar.
eddie,"Yeah, his Great Leap Forward."
van loon,"The guy comes on, out of nowhere, so fucking strong he has me on the run. Beat me out of two properties, invests in bumfuck countries with no oil, places I wouldn't go near, sextuples his money."
anchorwoman,"... found dead in her hotel room last night, victim of foul play."
van loon,"...100 billion if he has a nickel... and I have to convince him, somehow, that I can raise his game."
anchorwoman,An unidentified eyewitness has reported seeing a man with a limp leaving the scene. 
van loon,You can't tell me he's in this to improve the fucking planet. He owns a ball team.
eddie,Excuse me.
melissa's voice,"Hi, Eddie... it's Melissa. Listen, call me back as soon as you--"
eddie,Melissa--?
melissa, Eddie--?
eddie,"Melissa, I want to talk to you. Please. Meet me somewhere..."
melissa,We're talking now.
eddie,"Nonono -- at Charlie's, across the street. At two."
melissa,"You can't see me, Eddie."
eddie,"Please. Melissa -- it's important, please come -- you have to tell me what you're talking about!"
eddie,"Hello, may I speak to Paul Kaplan, please?"
woman's voice, Who is this?
eddie,I'm a journalist. From Electronics Today magazine.
woman's voice,Look... my husband died three days ago.
eddie,I'm... I'm so sorry. Goodbye.
male voice,Jerry's in -- who's this?
eddie,Uh-- Bill Johnson.
male voice,Well Bill... Jerry's in the hospital...  ...and he's really sick.
eddie,Oh my God. What's wrong with him?
male voice,"We don't know. He just started getting these headaches a couple of weeks ago...? Then, uh, last Wednesday he collapsed at work..."
man's voice,Hello...? Hello...?
eddie,Melissa...?
melissa,"Don't tell me I look good, because I know I don't. I didn't want you to see me this way...  You look good."
eddie,I guess I lost some weight...
melissa,"Yeah, well, MDT'll do that to you."
eddie,Since when do you read the Post?
melissa,"These days, the Post's about all I can read."
eddie,"Melissa, what do you mean?"
melissa,"I mean, I did it too. And I only took nine or ten hits. Vernon didn't tell you any of this, did he?"
eddie,No.
melissa,"Well, when he told me about this amazing new drug... "
eddie,Why?
melissa,"I'm not stupid. I mean, nobody can keep up that level of mental activity and not crash. I stopped taking it."
eddie,And...?
melissa,"I got sick. Headaches, throwing up... I went back to Vernon to see if I maybe shouldn't take another hit, or half a hit, and then he told me about... about the people who were dying. One guy didn't die, but he's a vegetable, his mother has to sponge him down every day...  How much have you been taking, Eddie?"
eddie,A lot.
melissa,"Well, maybe they've worked out the bugs. Maybe... maybe this isn't the same batch..."
eddie,Yeah.
melissa,Are you getting a headache?
eddie,Finish your story.
melissa,"Well, I didn't take more. And I didn't die. But after a while I found I couldn't concentrate on anything for longer than ten minutes. I missed deadlines. I got lazy... and slow... put on weight... the magazine let me go. My husband checked out. Sex? Get out of here."
melissa,"You have some left? Good. Go home and take it. Take the dose down, but don't just stop -- you'll die if you just stop. Try to taper off. Otherwise, the headache's just the beginning... I have to go--"
eddie,But when I run out--
melissa,I don't know. I have to go--
eddie,Who invented MDT?
melissa,"I don't know--  Goodbye, Eddie."
gennady,You fucking forget about me? Huh?
eddie,I... I... ahh...
gennady,One o'clock? And you not here?! Eddie tries to catch his breath.
eddie,I'm here now!
eddie,I'll get you a check.
gennady,"A check? A check?! You out of your fucking mind?! What you think we are, some financial institution?"
eddie,"Gennady, look-"
gennady,I cut your balls off!
eddie,"I wasn't thinking. Look, we just need to go to my bank- OOF!"
gennady,What you got there?
eddie,NOTHING--
gennady,Don't look like no aspirin I ever see!
eddie,"That's the whole thing, plus twenty."
gennady,I feel good. What in that shit?
eddie,Aspirin and vitamins.
gennady,"You fucking full of shit, Morgan. I know you lie about the movie script too."
female assistant,"Lindy...? I wouldn't have let him in, but I know you know him..."
lindy,"It's all right, Lisa."
eddie,I'm sorry -- I'm sick. I wasn't going to make it home-
lindy,"Okay. Okay, I'll get you to a DOCTOR--"
eddie,IT WON'T HELP--! I need to get-- it's very simple: I need my pills.
lindy,What kind of pills?
eddie,They're... for my headaches...
lindy,What headaches? What are you--?  Are you on some drug?
eddie,It's... complicated.
lindy,"Oh. Oh. So all this energy of yours, all this focus... has been some drug, Eddie?"
eddie,Not... the way you...
lindy,You need a doctor.
eddie,No. That won't--
valerie,What the hell are you doing up there?
eddie,W-what?
valerie,Are you tearing up your floor or something?!
lindy,...a smart drug...?
eddie,It was supposed to be legal.
lindy,"Oh, Eddie... you jerk."
eddie,I have a supply... stashed...
lindy, No.
eddie,I just need... to get it...
lindy,And I'm supposed to just GO?! In the middle of my work day?! To your APARTMENT to get you more DRUGS?
eddie,Not to my apartment. I moved it.
lindy,You did--? Why?!
eddie,I was smart. I was on MDT.
lindy,Then where did you keep it--?
lindy,You asshole... in my fucking HOUSE?!
eddie,Hi -- Have you got it?
lindy,"Yes. --Eddie, there's someone following me."
eddie,Are you sure?
lindy,"He got into the cab behind me, and they're making every turn I'm making!"
eddie,Don't get out.
lindy,What the fuck did you put me in the middle of--?!
eddie,Call the cops.
lindy," He's getting out, Eddie -- he's walking over here-"
eddie,LINDY--!!!
lindy,Help! Help!!
eddie,Yes. What's happening?
lindy,"I'm hiding, but I'm stuck. He'll find me!"
eddie,"Just be still, stop talking."
lindy,He killed a cop--
eddie,What?
lindy,"He's going to kill me, Eddie!"
eddie,Listen to me. Can he see you?
lindy, You fucking asshole--
eddie,Can he see you?!
lindy,Not yet. --I don't know what to do! What do I do--!
eddie,There is something.
lindy,What?!
eddie,Listen to me. Reach into the bag and take one of the pills.
lindy,S-swallow one of those things?!
eddie,Yes.
lindy,He's got a knife -- I can't think my way out of a knife--!
eddie,"You'll come on in thirty seconds. And yes, you will think your way out, that's what it does. Are you taking it--?"
lindy, Yes. He's getting closer.
eddie,Lindy. I love you.  --Lindy? Are you there?
lindy,Eddie...? I feel it.
eddie,"We'll stay here for a couple of days. We'll be powered up, we'll be able to think our way out of this..."
lindy,"Who's back, Eddie?"
eddie,I can take care of you now.
lindy,That was never what I wanted.
eddie,A lot's going to happen for us. And everything that I will have... I will share with you. I will love you.
lindy,You know... you were always smart. You could have done this. Not this... but some of these things... maybe a third of these things... without any smart drug at all. A third of all this... to most people...? ...would be plenty.
eddie,Looking for me?
gennady,You think you can run out on me? You think I don't know where you are?
eddie,I was under the impression that our business was settled.
gennady,Walk.
eddie,So now you're going to rob me? I thought you were a businessman.
gennady,I want some more of that shit.
eddie,What shit.
gennady,The pills.
eddie,"Well, so do I. You took the last one."
gennady,So you get me more.
eddie,I can't get more -- the dealer's dead.
gennady,Oh. Well. Too bad for you. Because how you gonna go to those fancy meetings with your nose fed to my dog?
eddie,Nothing. I. Can. Do.
gennady,Make some calls. One hundred pills.
eddie,"A hundred can't happen. The dealer's dead, I have to call three people to even get a line on--"
gennady,"You know I don't really do this. So clean, like this. What I do to you, I do in stages."
eddie,I might... be able to get ten.
gennady,Ten. Fuck your ten.
eddie, Ten. And no guarantee there's more.
gennady,"Oh, I think guarantee."
van loon,"I won't deny you pissed me off, Eddie."
eddie,"I was sick. I shouldn't have gone to the meeting. I tried to cancel, but Kevin imploded on me--"
van loon,I didn't know who or what I was talking to.
eddie,"A hundred and five, is what you were talking to, Carl. Delirium."
van loon,"Look, there can't be any instability. Not when you're playing at this level."
eddie,I sent over my revised projections--
van loon,I didn't ask for your projections.
eddie,"I know, but I think if you look at THEM-"
van loon,I already have.
eddie,I'm sorry.
van loon,"...some things my team missed. So, oddly enough, I find myself... needing to fill a position."
eddie,Is it possible to construct an... imperceptible compartment?
tailor,"Certainly, sir. How large?"
eddie,Quite large.
eddie,"I don't want it known that I have any security. You won't precede me, you'll follow me, never less than ten steps behind... `inconspicuous' doesn't begin to describe you. You're not there. You're a CEO'S wife -- you're wallpaper."
technician,"Well, it's nothing you can cook up on a stove top. Whoever made it, it's a real pro act."
eddie,Can you make more?
technician,Can I combine these ingredients in the same exact quantities? Yes. 
eddie,Meaning...?
technician,Clinical trials. Guinea pig people.
eddie,That's too long.
technician,"It's what it is. Or you'll kill people. You need twelve, eighteen MONTHS--"
eddie,Two million dollars if you do it in six.
detective,"This isn't about Vernon Gant, Mr. Morgan."
eddie,What is it about?
detective,A witness identified the Donatella Alvarez suspect as this person. You want to tell me about your whereabouts on the night of June 12?
morris brandt,You're lucky somebody wiped the room. Weak circumstantial at best. Just between us -- were you there?
eddie,I don't remember.
morris brandt, Busy life.
hank atwood,How do you know this?
eddie,"Well, the governmental bribe structure is, in itself, corrupt, so of course information about its inner workings, like anything, can be bought. And there are other barbarians waving cash at the gates. I have a list here, in descending order of threat..."
atwood,Go on.
van loon,Eddie...? What's your read.
eddie,"It flew. Of course, he's not going to tell you right now..."
van loon,Jesus. He seems frail.
eddie,Might be an act.
van loon,"Yeah, doesn't track. He's not even"
eddie,When this is over?  I don't know. You haven't given me the answer.
van loon,You haven't asked the question.
eddie,All right. If all this comes off... what's my take?
van loon,You should have pre-negotiated.
eddie,I trust you.
van loon,You shouldn't.
eddie,"Well, given the scale of my contribution, it can't be anything lese than forty. Let's say forty- five."
van look,Done. Forty five thousand dollars.
van loon,"Forty million's plenty, Eddie. There's plenty more where this came from."
van look,"...But you're not going to continue working for me, are you?"
van loon,Don't lie. You're already bored. Onto the next...?
realtor,"... three restaurants, health club, of course, a private screening room, wine cellar, walk-in humidor... unparalleled, three-tier security system..."
eddie,What is the asking price?
realtor,Twelve point five.
gennady,Next week...? I require twenty pills.
eddie,Next week? You can fuck yourself.  Not that you'll feel anything.
gennady,I don't think your Forbes 400 new financial friends would appreciate the details of your little dilemma with the police?
pierce,"Well, you want to call it?"
van loon,There was all last night to tell us that.
secretary's voice,Not yet.
eddie,"Okay, the decision could have changed -- that makes sense -- but the discourtesy doesn't.  It's still on."
pierce," Oh, based on your graphs and projections?"
eddie, I saw his eyes: it's on.
pierce,"You know, remind me: who the fuck, exactly, are YOU?! --I'm sorry, Carl, I'm about at the end with this unqualified, posturing little-"
van loon,"Pull it back, Pierce."
pierce,Since when is this little pisher the fucking Delphi Oracle?!
van loon,PIERCE-
secretary's voice," Mr. Van Loon, Mrs. Atwood is here."
van loon,"Pierce, you can stay."
eddie,"I realize that this is a useless platitude, but... if there's anything we can do..."
van loon,Obviously we want to be as helpful and respectful as possible.
van loon, You think there's a proxy?
eddie,Cagey fuck like him giving away power of attorney?
van loon,Well. He'd better get better.
morris brandt,I've been all over them... we can't allow any disparity in race or physical type between you and the rest of the lineup -- they're as close to your clones as I could possibly get away with -- it's going to be one big handsome blur to this guy-
female cop,Mr. Morgan...? I need you to change your jacket.
eddie,Why?
morris brandt,"Oh, that's me... I want everyone in the same shirt, better for the blur factor..."
eddie,Of course.
morris brandt,Not the dimmest clue. He was dithering.
female newscaster,"...And the Dow has been yo-yoing all day, amidst speculation that Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood have negotiated a merger..."
van loon,Have you been talking to anyone?
eddie,"Not a word, Carl."
van loon,"Where have you been, Eddie--? This is the second time you've turned to VAPOR--"
eddie,"Personal time, Carl. Phone off. You're not telling me there's been any movement."
van loon,No. Atwood's in a coma.
eddie,A coma?
van loon,Eddie--? This came for you.
van loon,"What are you doing, Eddie--? EDDIE--!!!"
gennady,I told you I want more. You don't listen. Maybe you think I'm joking...
eddie,I'm plum out.
gennady,"They will find it. Or I will make you tell me. Which is quicker? We see, huh?"
gennady,"This is a waste of my time, you know that? I am getting out of this part of the business... starting import-export company. Very exciting stuff. A lot on my plate. I need to learn to delegate..."
eddie,"I'm sure you're curious about what's happened to your boss. I certainly am. If my attorney was really working for Mr. Atwood, to save his life, then why is he dead? At what point was the Pony Express supposed to ride in with the life- saving medication?  Or, did the Pony decide that he should be running his own Pony show? Minus the dog."
reuben,"...actually, no, there's no more tickets. --Yeah, I know, an overbooked fundraiser -- there's a first -- well, here he comes, I'll ask him -- Edward!!"
eddie,I have a lunch.
reuben,John Steadman's in there.
eddie,Who's that?
reuben,"--Eiben-Chemcorps? Look, they're your biggest contributor, give him his two shitty little minutes."
eddie,Eiben-Chemcorps. What are they -- research?
reuben,Pharmaceuticals.
steadman,Mr. Morgan.
eddie,Nice to see you.
steadman,"Well, you've done most of it for yourself. Senator Morgan."
eddie,Maintain?
steadman,Eventually you'll run out. I just want you to know we're here to help you.
eddie,What are you saying?
steadman,We've gotten most of the bugs out. It's longer lasting - you'll only have to take one a week.
eddie,Have you been watching me from the beginning?
steadman,No. Those of you who indulged... distinguished yourselves very quickly. You made yourselves clear to us.
eddie,"Who's ""us?"""
steadman,"You went the furthest with it the fastest, so of course, to us, you're the most interesting."
eddie,How did it get on the street?
steadman,Security breach. That was never our intention. We took care of it.
eddie,And what about for you? Why don't you take it?
steadman,We don't have to. You'll take it for us.
eddie,And in return...? I do what.
steadman,Just keep on doing what you're doing. We won't bother you much at first.
eddie,"And later...? What will you be ""bothering"" me with?"
steadman,"Well, given where you're heading, some of our ideas are... grandiose. But, I think, achievable."
eddie,And if I don't like your ideas?
steadman,"Then we'll say Godspeed. And your candle will have shed a brief, but lovely, light."
eddie,Luckily I can do that myself.
steadman,"Well, no, ah, that won't be the case. We shut your lab down this morning."
eddie,My lab?
steadman,All of them.
eddie,You sure?
steadman,"We were right about you Eddie - you're gonna go all the way. Let's not do anything to jeopardize that. There's no downside here - we're offering you a limitless supply with fewer side effects. I think you'll be pleased with the arrangement.  Come on, let's get some lunch. I'm starving..."
eddie,Tell me something.
steadman,Do you really want to know?
steadman,"It's not so bad, is it?"
eddie,After you.
steadman," No, ""Senator"". You first."
eddie,Please.
steadman,All right then...
eddie,Don't underestimate your own creation.
steadman,You don't know the caliber of enemies you'll be making.
eddie,You want to push that button? I'll show you my silos if you show me yours.
steadman,You'll run out. You'll die.
eddie,Or I'll think of something. Isn't that what MDT does? Makes you think of something? Might even tell me how to get off it.
