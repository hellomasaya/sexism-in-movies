mumble,But that's what we have to find out. Don't you see. Things like that could be eating the fish.
adelies,Okay. Okay. Here's the plan: we go and ask the revered one.
mumble,The who?
the adelies,...Reverend Loveday. ...The One who Knows ...First we gonna need stones though
mumble,Why stones? Wait for me
loveday,"First, the devotion..."
loveday,The Mystic Beings are speaking to me. Yes! She is alive and happy and you are in her thoughts...
loveday,"One pebble, one question. Next!"
adelie,...How does he do it? ...He just one look and he know.
loveday,A little nervous? That's normal. Take your time.
mumble,I was wondering. Have You ever been abducted by Aliens?
loveday,No time wasters. Next!
the adelies,...Seor! That's not his question. He's new here.  ...The yellow thing ...Ask him what's taking the fish?
mumble," ...you see I met a Skua once, with something like that on his legs...."
loveday,...Skua? Leg? What's he talking about?
mumble,... and he said he was abducted by Aliens.
loveday," Listen friend, this is my Sacred Talisman, bestowed upon me by the Mystic Beings..."
mumble,Looks like they bestowed it very tight.
loveday,...during my Epic Journey of Enlightenment to the Forbidden Shore!
mumble,"So these Mystic Beings, did you see them?"
loveday,I hear them. They talk to me all the time I am their instrument. They chose me to......
mumble,Did they have frontways eyes? No feathers? Fat flabby faces? Did they probe you and stick a pointy thing into you?
loveday,Enough! How many questions is that? You don't have enough pebbles.
mumble,But I haven't had any answers yet!
loveday,SILENCIO!! The Mystic Beings are speaking. They say show some respect stranger. Especially to the One who Knows.
female adelies,..Me Loveday. ..Me! ..No Me !
loveday,One at a time! And don't touch the Talisman!
adelies,....I liked him better when he was just plain Pedro. ...Did he say it starts today ...why didn't someone tell us. ...We gotta get to work guys!!
the adelies,"...Hola Baby! Get your chica boom-boom here. ... Turn round, look at us!."
female,...How many rocks you got.
her friend,...Forget `em honey. They only one between the six of them...and they just spent it.
an adelie, Wait. Look.
adelies,...You like it ...Arriba! ...What do you need stones for
female friend,"Try sitting on the ice for a month. It might come to you Salsa Boy. Come on, Consuela."
the adelies,"...Their loss, guys. ...Ramon, where you going?"
ramon,"Gotta be some rocks left here somewhere!  Hey big guy, got any love stones over where you come from?"
mumble,"We don't collect them. All we have to do is , well... We sing"

the adelies, ...What's he doing? ...Its a distress call ...Its world music ...Get out of here!
mumble,See. That's how I ended up with you guys. And emperor who can't sing isn't an emperor at all.
an adelie,"Man. You're an emperor all right, You're a king among emperors. The singing we can fix."

caruso,Happy WHAT?! This is an OUTRAGE!
the elders,... The kid was never quite the full Penguin. ... It all began the year he hatched. ... That's right! He's the one who brought the blight!
mumble, Wait. Wait. You think it's my fault that there are no fish?!! Doing Happy Feet can't cause a food shortage.
an elder,...then what did?!
mumble,"My own opinion? I think living beyond the ice there are creatures we've never met before Aliens. Mystic Beings. Big, flabby......"
elders, ...He has abandoned the faith. ...He has driven the fish away.
the adelies," ...Come on hombre, loosen up, ...the tall guy was just trying to...."
an elder,Don't touch me! Heathen!!
mumble,"BACK OFF, YA SCREWY-ASS FLIPPERBIRD!"
the elders, ...He's the spawn of evil!! ...The devil penguin!!!
mumble,This is craziness
a voice,"No, Son they're right."
mumble,You too pa?!
wishful,"Truth is, I'm the cause of it. I dropped the egg. I made you how you are. If only you'd come back to us, relinquish the dark side"
mumble,No. Dad. No. What have they done to you. You're talking like Caruso.
wishful,Just do it. Pray to the Forefathers for forgiveness.
mumble,No. You're nuts. All of you. I'm outa here.
ella,Wait! Mumble!
mumble,Its no use Ella. I can't live with that.
ella,Can you live without it?
adelies,...True ...That's a big question
mumble,Guys. Can Me and Ella be alone for a bit
ella,But what about?...
mumble,"Its the only way. You're right. Unless we have food theres no future for any of us - you, me the adelies, anyone"
ella,But...
mumble,"Give me a year, just until the next great gathering. If I don't make it back ....at least I tried"
ella,But...
mumble,Now go back. I love you. Go.
caruso,"""Together we stand"""

caruso,"Louder. More fervent bretheren. ""When the Sun vanishes..."""
all,"""We Remain."""
adelies,Tell me again where we're going.
mumble,To find the mystic beings.
adelies,How do we know where they live.
mumble,We'll ask Loveday. He's been there.
mother,...Not so close. We got babies on board
adelies,...Wow. Does nesting make em touchy
the adelies,"...LOVEDAY, you okay?? ...what happened ...Too much boom-boom for one penguin?"
mumble,Just one question! And I want a straight answer! Where do I find the Mystic Beings?
an adelie,Why don't he speak?
adelies,...He's possessed! ...It's a seizure!
mumble,No. He's choking! The Talisman's gotten way too tight.
the adelies,"...Why din' you say so? ...Hold on we gonna take it off. ...You pull that side, I pull this side."
mumble,Stop. You're hurting him.
an adelie,Any better?
the adelies,...It not gonna come off. ...Of course it's not! It's sacred!
mumble,"LOVEDAY, where did you get it?"
the adelies,...It was bestowed on him. ...By the Mystic Beings!
mumble,They didn't bestow it on you?
the adelies,...Poor Guy. ...He don't know what he's saying.
mumble,"If it wasn't bestowed, what happened?"
the adelies,"...Oh, this one's easy. ...He swam.... ...On his Hectic Journey of Delightenment... ...To the Forbidding Shore."
mumble,And then....?
an adelie,...Well to me that's gotta be bestowing.
mumble,You looked up and...... It just got caught around your neck?
adelies,...No way. No. He's the revered one ...He speaking symbolically.
mumble," Loveday, did you ever meet a Mystic Being? Really?"
an adelie,Oh my! Now he thinks he's an Elephant Seal
mumble,The forbidden place is over the mountains...
loveday,Oi
adelies,...Stop. Enough. We must've gone past it ...Past? Don't kid me. We're not even close.
mumble,Hear that?!
the adelies,"...Refresh my memory do elephant seals eat penguin? ...No, no...jus' krill and fish. ...Sure of your facts are you?"
adelies,Well I guess we're about to find out
mumble,"Excuse me, we need directions...to the Forbidden Shore."
mumble,We're looking for the Mystic Beings
mumble,"Aliens, the ones who made this."
mumble,Could they be taking our fish?
mumble,"But If your grandpappys saw them and they survived, maybe they're not so fierce."
mumble,"Come on Loveday, lets go"
adelies, ...Go where? ...didn't you hear what he said ...Its Forbidden
mumble,They don't know. They've never been there
an adelie,"Stop! I'm hearing voices. The mystical guys. They say: ""Your life is perfectly good as it is...forget this stupid mission""."
another adelie,"Ramon. That was embarrassing, man."
mumble,So we walked ... and walked .. and kept walking. Over the hills and into Blizzard country
the adelies,...Oh man! This is no place for a penguin! ...We should be migrating out to sea by now!
mumble,We need to huddle!
the adelies,Huddle??!
mumble,"Form a moving circle! Share the cold, share the warmth!"
the adelies,"...Oh yeah, nice. ...That's definitely better. ...Good call big guy."
mumble,I said a circle!
an adelie,"...No, no. This can't be right! ...It was better the other way."
the adelies,...Hey! ...What happened to the Huddle?!
mumble," Just keep moving! Toboggan, if you have to!!"
the adelies,"...Oh no, now I got chest pain ...tell you, this is a good way to get snow blind "
mumble,You think this is it? The Forbidden Shore?
adelies,"....The way I feel"": the ""frostbitten"" shore ....So what are those black things?."
mumble,Hello?! Is there anyone out there?
the adelies,"...No need to shout. ...Yeah, somebody might hear you. ...I think we seen all there is to see round here."
mumble,What is it?
mumble,They must be here somewhere. They wouldn't leave all this stuff lying around.
an adelie,Maybe they invisible.
an adelie,What is that?
mumble,A whale?
an adelie,"As long as it's a good whale, not the other kind."
another adelie,What other kind?!!
mumble,The ones with teeth!!
the adelies,...Jump! ...Swim for it!
mumble,No!! Stay on the ice pad where its safe
the adelies,...You call this safe amigo? ...Maybe we should split up. ...You split up I'm staying right here.
mumble, LOVEDAY! LOVEDAY!!
mumble,Aliens?!
the adelies,...AMIGO-O-O-O! ...LET IT GO-O-O-O-O!!
the adelies,"...You found them, you found Aliens! ...Now we go back tell everybody who's taking the fish."
mumble,They've stopped!
