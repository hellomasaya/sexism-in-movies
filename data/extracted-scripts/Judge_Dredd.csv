narrator,"In the third millennium, the world... changed."
video poster," --oming soon, the Heavenly Haven Pocket Park. Bringing fresh air and recreation to your lives. Another design for better living from the Mega-City Council. Coming soon, the Heavenly Haven Pocket Park. Bringing fresh air..."
first resident,Our Park! They stole our park!
second resident,Lying bastards!
first resident,"Lying Judges! A ER::! gets tossed into the VIDEO SCREEN. As it SPARKS, the residents swarm, knocking it over - then the chain link fence around the lot starts to shake, heave and collapse -"
zed,"Hey, Homies. The rezzies are going mental."
fergie,Right down there... I think that's Heavenly Haven. NC such luck. The craft BANKS.
fergie,Still better than prison. BR.'.-TA':-TAT! Suddenly GUNFIRE erupts all around him. He looks
astonishment at,I'r SE ER.AL WINDOWS - HIS P . O . V . 20 As more and more frustrated residents OPEN FIRE at anything and everything.
zed,Did you see that! What a fucking shot! What a fucking shot - ! Reggie h -fives him. Then an overhead THUD makes them look up a- the HEATING VENT. Zed reaches up - yanks off the grate -
zed,"What do we have here? You a Judge, little man? The others laugh at the concept."
fergie,"Me, a Judge, no, no -"
zed,"You gonna stand up for your block, ain't ya?"
fergie,"Look, I'm out on parole - If I get into any trouble my ass is right back in Aspen - CLICK. Zed's gun is in his face. FERGIE  Let's go, Haven, Let's go Haven, Haven all the way - BANANA CLIPS are shoved into his hands along with boxes of :artridaes."
reggie,"Reload, dipshit. BULLETS rip through the windows here. Fergie ducks, _er-_fied... drops the bullets."
hershey,Take cover!
hershey, In position outside Heavenly Haven. Pinned down by fire from upper floors.
up angle,"The bike parts the flames like a curtain, SMASHES DOWN right in the middle of all the chaos. The Rider gets off."
brisco,That's our back-up? He's a sitting duck out there. You'd think he wants them to see him. Hershey smiles ruefully.
hershey,If that's who I think it is... he does.
twist,Fuck. That's Judge Dredd. We gotta surrender while we can-- He starts to raise his gun over his head. Zed smacks him in the yaw with his own weapon.
zed,"You chickenshit bowab! He's gonna surrender to us. And then we'll blow his brains out. . Come and get us, Dredd! Zed FIRES out the window. Reggie happily joins, then the others. Finally Twist shrugs, FIRES too."
hershey,Down! You crazy futz - !
dredd,He's firing a 64 laze pumper from six hundred feet. He couldn't hit me if I painted a bull's eye on my ass.
food robot,"Delicious and healthful ration packs, piping hot and ready to eat..!"
dredd,No. There.
dredd,"This room is pacified. mcves carefully through the smoke. Behind him, Hershey and"
brisco,This one's mine!
brisco,This room is under-- BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA! Brisco is blown backwards off his feet.
dredd,"You're all under arrest. Will you surrender, or would you like your trials now? 7ne', look at him for a moment - then BLAST away."
dredd,"Mega-City Municipal Code 334.8. Willful destruction of property. That's two years. WHAR:. He hits Zed in the face. Zed rocks, but stays up. He fries tc grab a nearby weapon, but Dredd kicks it away."
zed," Don't tell me. Life. CAMERA REVEALS that Zed another weapon hidden behind his back. Now, he goes for it!"
dredd,"No... Death. He FIRES at the same moment as Zed! Zed's shot hits Dredd's ARMOR, pings off. Dredd's shot hits Zed's heart."
hershey,I was supposed to watch out for him.
dredd,"He made the mistake. Not you. Dredd cocks his head, listening. Somehow in the din and confusion he has heard something. He turns."
food robot,"Ummm, umm, yumm! Healthful and nutritious food rations, ready to eat! Dredd suddenly pushes forward in the crowd. Hershey follows. She watches, puzzled, as he steps in the automaton's path, takes an assault rifle from another Judge and AIMS it!"
dredd, Five! Four!
food robot,"Ah, just put your credit in your selection and - credit in the slot and-and - shit! The robot stops. The jumble of food in back spills out and Fergie uncoils from the cramped interior, still holding the scarK r.a wires he was using to manipulate the machine."
dredd,"Mega-City Municipal Code 1286.4: Willful sabotage of a public servo-droid. That's six months, citizen. He grabs Fergie, pushes him against the wall."
fergie,"Come on, give me a break, Judge uh-."
dredd,"FERGUSON, Herman. Forget six months: You've hacked into city droids, computers...  Cash machines, robot taxis... And you haven't even been out of jail for twenty four hours."
fergie,"Five years? But - I - I had no choice, judge - He sees Dredd's impassive face, turns to Hershey's more sympathetic one."
dredd,"Not at all. You could have climbed out a window, worked your way down. Or found a turboshaft and shimmied down the cable."
fergie,Sixty stories? It woulda been suicide!
dredd,"Maybe. But it would have been legal. I sentence you to five years in. Aspen Penitentiary. Case closed. Take him away. s-': protesting, Fergie is hauled away. Hershey looks at Dredd."
hershey,He might have been telling the truth. Haven't you ever heard of extenuating circumstances?
yamamoto,"Hold on, Judge McGruder - let's not blame the messenger! Judge Griffin"
esposito,- Griffin has been trying to get us to swallow his crime package  for two years now and I still have
fargo,"Order, order! As presiding Justice, I only vote to break a tie. But I wish to address the question of Judge Griffin's crime package. Is there any objection?"
griffin,"This entire body owes its very existence to you, Chief Justice. "
fargo,This body is not the first assembly  barely in my teens when I put on this badge. When the time comes for me to take it off... let me do it. knowing that it stood for Freedom... and not for Repression. He sits down. Clearly he has changed the mood of the room.
judge griffin,"Once again, Chief Justice,'you have served as a moral compass for all of us. I... withdraw my proposal."
dredd," A rookie Judge died there, too. I guess he wasn't worth mentioning."
ddd,"Things will get better, sir."
fargo,"Four Summary Executions, Dredd.  Were they necessary?"
dredd,"With all due respect, sir, how can you say that when you spend most of your time - D edd breaks off; he's said too much. But Fargo won't let him she hook."
fargo,Most of my time where?
dredd,At the Academy... Sir.
fargo,"Don't you mean at the Academy wiping Cadet's Asses? That is what they say in the squad room, isn't it?"
dredd,"It.. doesn't matter what they say, Sir. You're the.Chief Justice of Mega City. If rt weren't for you and the others like you, we wouldn't have our justice system. There isn't a Judge in Mega-City who doesn't want to follow in your footsteps."
fargo,"I'm glad you feel that way, Dredd. Because starting tomorrow you're going to spend one day a week at the Academy... teaching. Dredd takes this in his stride."
fargo," Ethics. And as Dredd reacts, we"
computer voice,Voice sample and thumbscan recognized. The DOOR OPENS. Miller turns to the guards. MILLER  Wait here.
rico's voice,"Hello, Warden."
miller,"A short one, I'm afraid. Duty calls."
miller,When you killed innocent people you went far beyond-'service. Rico stands. Moves toward the energy curtain. Glares at Miller.
rico,"""Innocent""? A meaningless word. The innocent exist only until they inevitably become perpetrators themselves. In the end, ""Guilt"" and ""Innocence"" are merely a matter of timing."
miller,'You're insane.
rico,"Am I? When did you become a perpetrator? Was it the time you found money mysteriously transferred into your account? Or the time I was sentenced to death? You've been taking bribes for years, Warden. You're a criminal. And a stupid one: You don't even know who's paying you."
miller,I don't want to know.
rico,"If ignorance is bliss, Warden, then  you must be very blissful."
miller,"Your mysterious benefactor has sent you a package. M:.. .er speaks into a console before Rico's laser-guarded ""cell."
rico,"The Ancient Puzzle, Miller: The One about the Meaning of Life."
rico,"It's over. And he AIMS the ""puzzle"". BLAM!"
computer voice,Voice not recognized. Security Breach. Autoguns targeting. panics. Scrambles for the door.
dredd,"Kevlar nine helmet and body armor. WIDEN. Dredd is LECTURING to a group of CADETS who hang on his every word. We're in a TRAINING AREA like the one ""Q"" ran in the Bond movies. Dredd turns. A TECH nods: Target ready. Dredd FIRES a barrage of bullets at a mannequin in Judge's gear. The bullets ricochet off. The class OOOHS and AHHS.  DREDD"
dredd, But they are what we give to (Xi others... not what we will ever receive for ourselves. Class dismissed. The class breaks up on a definite low note.
hershey,"Well, I think your truth is relative. I have a personal life. I have lots-of friends."
dredd,Really. How long since you saw any of them?
dredd,You've only been on the street a year. You're still in denial.
hershey,It's not that bad.
dredd,How many married Judges do you know?
hershey,"Uh, well, my class is young. None of them have found the right... person. e lust looks at her."
dredd,Yes. Once.
hershey,What happened?
rico,You're holding a package for me. I'm. Rick.
geiger,"Oh, yeah... Gimme a second."
rico,I thought they destroyed all the ABC Warbots?
geiger,"Whoa, friend, whoever sent you this is no friend at all."
ri co,Oh? And why's that?
geiger,"That's a Lawgiver. It's programmed to only recognize a Judge's hand. You want a weapon, I can get you something nice. But if you touch that it'll take your arm off."
rico,Really? grabs it! Geiger flinches - then looks puzzled.
robot,"Status. Commander. Mission. Rico strikes a match on the robot, lights a cigar."
rico,Status: Personal bodyguard. Commander: Rico. Mission: We're going to war.
lily,"Vardis, if you're right, then this Judge Dredd isn't really part of the conspiracy."
hammond,"No, of course n9t. It began before he was born. It had to have."
lily,Then your report tomorrow _will destroy an innocent man. Doesn't Dredd's future bother you?
hammond,"Yes. But I'm more worried about all of our futures then about Judge... The door THUDS open. Startled, they turn -"
dredd,Is this your car?
car owner,"Hey, come on... what are you gonna do, tow me?"
dredd,Of course not. Towing is the penalty for the first offense. This is your second violation.  Grenade.
fargo,Dredd. I... I can't believe it...
griffin,"I'm afraid the evidence is conclusive. The trial will be just a formality. Fa:=c descends shakily from his seat. Moves to the window. :e =axes a pill from his pocket, tries to swallow it without ;_ _ f _ _r. seeing"
fargo,"Is it possible? Dredd, homicidal too? We went through.this nine years ago..."
griffin,"We were able tohide the facts then. This time, we may not be so lucky."
griffin,The victim was a reporter. The media is already sniffing around. Eventually... they'll get to the truth.
griffin,About Janus... and your part in it.
fargo,How... how long have you known?
griffin,Does it matter?
griffin,"There's a way out, Chief Justice."
fargo,Into oblivion? You're suggesting I take it? You-fiust really want to destroy me -
griffin,No. I want to save the Judge system. The media won't stop digging into Dredd's case. When they get to the bottom... they'll find you.
fargo,My Walk will give you the Chief Judgeship!
griffin,It could also save Dredd's life.
judge hunter,In here. The Judge Hunters open a HOLDING CELL. Hershey steps inside.
hershey,You're under.indictment? For what?
dredd,Murder. (X
dredd,"That is the Law, Judge McGruder. I would expect no less."
griffin,The Court shares in Judge McGruder's sentiments. In a way I am glad that Judge Fargo is about to begin his Long Walk.
mcgruder,The video you have just seen is prima fascia evidence that the defendant is guilty as charged. Mark this video People's Exhibit
clerk,"So marked. At the defendant's station, Hershey stands."
hershey,"Objection, Your Honor. This video is inadmissible as evidence."
mcgruder,"Judge Hershey, are you serious? Both of them recognized Judge Dredd!"
hershey,That is the State's interpretation. Replay dialogue. _EC rewinds. Then:
hershey,"Stop video. Do you hear it? When Lily Hammond says ""Dredd"", it's  could just as easily be the same. The suggestion that either has recognized their murderer is sheer supposition... or, in the case of the prosecution, wishful-thinking! BIG REACTION from the packed room. Griffin bangs the gavel for silence."
dredd,Judge Hershey. I'm really glad I picked you to defend me.
hershey,You only picked me because you didn't have anyone else.
dredd,I'm still glad.  CAMERA FOLLOWS Hershey forward.
hershey,It clearly shows nothing!
hershey,Cadet Olmeyer is acknowledged by  I ask for a ruling.
griffin,Objection... sustained. The video is inadmissib e.
bailiffs,"Order, order!"
dredd,That kid barely knows me and he wants to save my ass.
hershey,Trust me. It's not your ass he's interested in.
mcgruder,Your Honor. I am forced now to enter certain technical evidence of a critical nature regarding 
mcgruder,"Central. I wish to access weapons schematics, Judges division. Describe the workings of the standard Judge's sidearm, the Lawgiver Two, and especially its improvements over the earlier Lawgiver One. Central SPEAKS. Somehow its monotonous, sexless voice hints at an actual personality."
central,One moment.
centrals voice,"This is obtained in a download from my medical files and upgraded automatically every time the weapon is reloaded. Each time a round is chambered and fired, it is tagged with the relevant DNA."
mcgruder,Central. Were the bullets recovered from the bodies of Vardis and Lily  Hammond so DNA coded?
central,"Yes, Judge McGruder. It could not be otherwise."
mcgruder,And what was the result of the computer check of the DNA coding on those bullets? :ould swear that the computer is going for drama.
central,The DNA is a perfect match for Judge Joseph--D-re--dd. _:iAMSER - WIDE SHOT
hershey, DNA evidence is irrefutable!
dredd,"Do your job. She nods, stands."
hershey,Your Honor... the defense rests.
mcgruder,"Your Honor, the Prosecution rests."
griffin,"The Jury may be sequestered. The Foreman, COUNCIL JUDGE ESPOSITO, stands."
esposito,"Your Honor, sequestering is not necessary. The evidence is irrefutable."
griffin's voice,"""Let the Betrayer of the Law be taken from our Courts;"" Already the Judge Hunters are coming for him."
hershey,Dredd. I... I'm sorry.
dredd,"You did your best, Judge Hershey. He stands, takes her hand."
griffin's voice,"""Let the Freedom he stole from others be stolen from himself;"""
hershey,Dredd..!
griffin,"""Let his armor be taken from him, and all his garb of Justice..."""
female cadet,"""Let him be written in our hearts and our memories."" She hands him the Book. Receives his bundle of worldly h=_ongings in return. A young MALE CADET steps forward, hands Fargo an ancient REMINGTON."
griffin's voice,"""Let him be stricken from our hearts and our memories."""
female cadet,"""Forever."" A line of CADETS raises Lawgivers overhead. They FIRE a 21 GUN SALUTE. Fargo walks out. TYye gate CLOSES. "
griffin's voice,"""Forever."""
griffin,"Are you out of your mind, coming here? Griffin angrily starts forward... stops when the ABC robot moves to block his path."
rico,I like to do things my way. 
griffin,"Yes, I know. Like framing Dredd for Hammond's murder."
griffin,Hammond had to be silenced when he found out abut Janus! But I could have used Dredd! He practically worshiped the ground I walked on-
rico,"Dredd only worships the Law. And he'd blow you away the minute he found out just how much you're pissing on it. Trust me: It's better this way. Let him see what it's like to freeze his ass off in Aspen. Let him see what it's like I to be me! After all... He moves closer to Griffin, smiles."
griffin,There's a lot of work to be done.
rico,Yes. The Janus lab -
griffin,"You'll see it soon enough. In the meantime... I want chaos, Rico. That block war was just the beginning. Now I want fear racing through every street... terror in every quad... panic in every block. Until those miserable rezzies think even their Judges can't save them. That's when the Council will turn to me... and to Janus. Rico moves towards the door. Pauses."
rico,"Fear, Terror, Panic. I think I can handle that. After all...  Look how quickly I brought fear in here. His smile fades and he exits."
fergie,Dredd? What are you doing here?
dredd,I was convicted of a crime.
fergie,That makes two f us.
dredd,No. You got the sentence the Law required. The Proper sentence.
fergie,Proper? Five years just for saving my own ass? .It was a mistake!
dredd,The Law does not make mistakes.
fergie,Yeah? Then how do you explain what happened to you?
fergie,"Actually, "
computer voice,"Zone A open. Please reset alarm. Hershey steps in, putting a small tool away in a belt pouch. She closes the door. Takes in the monastic feel of the place. She moves to the bookcase: A small collection of leather-bound books, maybe a dozen in all. Plato, More, Jefferson, Paine. Hershey runs her fingers over the well-worn titles."
computer voice,"If Alarm is not reset, .system will signal armed response in 20 seconds. Hershey opens a drawer. A.few clothes. She slips her hands underneath, feels around, finds nothing. Opens the next drawer."
hershey, Well. Baby Dredd.
computer voice,Ten. Nine. Eight... Hershey folds the frame back up.. .slips out the door with it.
computer voice,Cancel. Thank you for your cooperation. 
dredd,What the hell's wrong? 
fergie,"The stabilizers controls! They got hit, toot  CAMERA RAKES to the control panel... and a SMOKING, SIZZLING section. The craft tilts alarmingly. Dredd grabs the stick, helps Fergie try and pull up. It's useless."
ilsa,Pathetic. She turns to leave... stops when she sees the amused eyes of the man watching her from four feet away: Rico.
rico,"Hello, Professor."
rico, I see you're still researching the dark night of the soul.
ilsa,"The research ended when they condemned you. I live here, now. You showed me that facing death was the only way to live. Her eyes glisten as she moves towards Rico, touches his arm."
rico,"Don't go woosy on me, Professor. We got work to do. He puts his arm around her. They step over her victim on their way out."
second hunter,Sir.We found tracks leading away  dozenpeople.
another hunter,Sir! We found someone. We follow them forward. Their flashlights converge on one of the WOUNDED GUARDS.
wounded guard,Thank God... thank - His eyes widen as their LASER GUNSIGHTS moves to his chest.
hershey,"Central, I need to access the graphics database."
central,"That could take several days, Judge Hershey. The Graphic Database covers all known graphics, from the Paleoithic Era to today. Hershey opens the framed viewies she took from Dredd's apartment, slides out the one with the adult Dredd."
hershey,Central? Central? Hello?
rico,"Come on, you piece of junk... "
griffin,You've made a lot of progress. Good.
ilsa's voice,Lights! About time - eyes narrow as Ilsa comes in from another area with a oboard.
ilsa,Since then I've learned innocence is just another lie. And that the best truths come only with pain.  And... speaking of painful truths... Here's our shopping list. She hands Griffin the digital notepad.
rico,Tomorrow. But it won't mean a thing if you can't get into Central's Janus files. They're still security locked.
griffin,Leave that to me. Meanwhile you have work to do... on the streets.
rico,"""Fear, Terror, Panic."" Yes. My favorite emotions."
ilsa,"Mine too. Rico turns, whistles at the robot like it's a dog."
rico,"C'mon, Fido. Walkies. The robot follows Rico and Ilsa out the door. Griffin watches"
shuttle recording, -- is Aspen Prison. Repeat do not land... riot in...gress... Warden dead... special prisoner...
aspen voice,".didn't even know he was here. Records showed execution... Rico, Samuel Rico... killed Warden... sabotaged security system... STATIC and GUNSHOTS end the tape. "
fergie,"We did it! We got them all! A SHAPE lunges up, close to CAMERA. It's one of the Hunters Dredd took out earlier, still alive enough to aim his weapon! Dredd aims his stolen one his trigger - CLICK! Empty! The Hunter squeezes Hunter turns - SLAM! The Hunter himself is hit! Shocked, the - gets off one last SHOT -"
dredd,"Fargo? BLOOD wells on Fargo's coat. e's been hit. As he sags, Dredd and Fergie rush towards him.H"
hershey,The Dance? You want me to go to 
hershey,"We're trying to save Judge Dredd, and you're using the situation to blackmail me. That's disgraceful!"
hershey, Yes!
hershey,Yes! Just do'it!
hershey,"Olmeyer, you stupid futz! You  analyzed the wrong picture!"
olmeyer,"I did?  She gropes around on the desk, finds the viewie frame with the s:o: of Dredd and Rico."
hershey,You were supposed to do this one! You just wasted three hours! c-_rrputer BEEPS. MESSAGES run by the bottom of the screen.
hershey,What?
hershey,You mean... it's not real?
fargo,"Bury me there, under the blind lady. ^redd doesn't understand. Fargo raises his arm, points to the statue of Justice weighing her scales."
dredd,No. You and the first Judges... you saved Mega-City.
fargo,"Yes. And almost lost our souls.  It seemed like,,a wise idea: Create the perfect Judge. Breed courage - wisdom - integrity. The Janus Project. We used the old Council for the base material. Five DNA samples were taken, two were chosen. One was mine."
dredd,"But.., but the orphanage told me my parents were killed by lawbreakers -- they gave me that picture of them -"
fargo,A fake. The psychs on the Janus project came up with that story. It was supposed to motivate you into law enforcement. It worked. Both times.
dredd,"What do you mean, both times?"
dredd,I have a... brother?
fargo,More than a brother.
fargo,"He had to be put down . But I wouldn't let them do that to you. Griffin blackmailed me into the Walk, Dredd. Don't trust him."
dredd,Like I trusted you?
fargo,"I'm sorry... son. The breath goes out of Fargo's body. He dies. Dredd stares at him, his world torn apart."
fergie,I buried him. Except for this. Dredd silently follows Fergie to the grave. Fergie shoves the Remington into the mound of earth as a marker.
dredd,To find Rico.
woman,"Two of them! They tried to... it was horrible! h T e Judges dismount, head that way. GUNSHOTS. SCREAMS. __rible tearing SOUNDS. "
fergie's voice,"There's no way in, Dredd!"
fergie,"And these Cursed Earthers, they made it through? , _"
dredd,"Actually, they were burned to a crisp. But the theory's sound."
fergie,What's wrong? Are you kidding? Did that helmet you wore all those years compress your brain? You're gonna get me killed!
fergie,"There's one loose out here, too! Big choice, I got! Dying of thirst or from a fireball up my ass! This is all your fault!"
dredd,My fault?
central,"I'm sorry, I can neither confirm nor deny your statement."
dredd,"Run! C=ouched over, they race up the slight slope."
fergie," Thirty... twenty nine... twenty eight... twenty seven... twenty six.. twenty five... _ 9 9 r,:ti : _I ? E... ND THEM 199 =e:gie's already beginning to drop back. The only guide in the dark is the slight reflection from CONDUIT on the chute floor."
dredd,Stop counting!
dredd,Fergie? Dredd hears a muffled SOUND beneath him. He reaches down... YANKS Fergie into view. Fergie spits out a mouthful of ashes.
fergie,"I'm alive. I'm alive! (seeing Dredd, less"
mcgruder,Whoever's doing it knows all our procedures... our security measures...even our scrambled frequencies - !
esposito,Now the street criminals are taking advantage of the situation. It's a nightmare!
yamamoto,"Hell, it's a Goddamn revolution!"
mcgruder,We can't replaee those Judges! it takes years of training! We may never be at full strength again!
griffin,There is a solution. (on their desperate
yamamoto,We tried to play God once! It almost destroyed the Council -
griffin,"If this wholesale slaughter of Judges continues, there won't be a council! Janus could -"
esposito,"Come on, Griffin! A new batch of test tube babies won't solve this crisis! We don't need reliable Judges 20 years from now when they're grown! We need them today!"
griffin,"There's been over thirty years of genetic research since Janus failed. What if we could create adult subjects, fully grown andfu3ly trained at birth? We could replace the Judges we've lost in weeks. We could save our society!"
esposito,Who knows if that's even possible?
mcgruder,Who knows if it's safe?
fergie,But Fargo said you couldn't trust
dredd,I don't. But I trust the Council. When I tell them about Rico...
fergie,"Just don't get us killed, Dredd. : still want that apology."
griffin,"Griffin, Douglas. .Chief Justice. Authorize access-to file, code name ""Janus""."
central,Acknowledged.
judge mcgruder,"McGruder, Evelyne. Council Judge. Authorize access to file, code name ""Janus""."
central,"Acknowledged. ON SCREEN, GRAPHICS show the SOFTWARE LOCKS being removed one by one from the Janus Files."
judge esposito,"Esposito, Carlos. Council Judge. Authorize access to file, code name ""Janus""."
central,Acknowledged.
yamamoto,"Yamamoto, Gerald. Council Judge. Authorize access to file, code name ""Janus""."
central,"I have unanimous authorization for access to file, code name ""Janus"". Removing security blocks. .NOW. Awaiting Password command from Presiding Chief Justice."
griffin,"Password... Janus. moves in front of the mac hi ne, speaks tersely. GRIFFIN  Central: Using current technology, how long would it take for Janus to produce a fully grown adult subject?"
central,Given the current state of genetic engineering an adult subject could be incubated in approximately eight hours. ASTONISHMENT in the room.
central,"Although only two subjects were produced in the original experiment, the laboratory was equipped with 20 incubators. if fully operational, 420 subjects could be produced a week."
yamamoto,My God. We could replace our losses in a day -
mcgruder,You aren't considering this madness?
yamamoto,No.. I'm just reacting to the possibility... a frightening possibility.
esposito,Yes. I for one... think this is an idea that should be forgotten.
mcgruder,"I agree. Judge Griffin, please  restore the Security Blocks."
griffin,"I see, now, that none of you have the force of will that these terrible times require. You will never open Janus again. So... we'll just leave it... unlocked. 216r EXT. COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT 216A Dredd is about to open the door when a HAND spins him around. It's the Judge who followed..him!"
judge,Dredd! I thought it was y-- That's all he says before Dredd K.O.'s him!
mcgruder,"Griffin, this is treason! You just sealed your fate!"
griffin,No. You've just sealed yours. Rico!
rico,Who says politics is boring?
dredd,You're mine.
griffin,Really? s moment we think he's going to shoot. Then he turns his points it at his own arm - fires!
griffin,"Stop him! He just killed the entire council! Dredd realizes he's fucked. He turns, runs. The Judge Hunters pause near their wounded leader; who bravely waves them on. ^.ey tear after Dredd like woJ-ves."
fergie,Dredd! Tell them I'm innocent!
night watchman,"Hey - ! That's all he gets out. Dredd hi-blocks him, barrels past."
fergie,"Dredd..? Dredd, you're not gonna-- Dredd hits the button marked ""AERIAL MODE"". There's a BEEP and the SOUND FX we heard earlier... when the flying prototype failed."
rico,Why didn't you kill him when you had the chance?
griffin,It's better with him on the loose. He'll keep the surviving street Judges preoccupied while we work on Janus.
griffin,"Excellent suggestion, Central. Do it."
central,"It's done. Council Judge Rico, may be the first to offer my congratulations?"
rico,Central... I'm touched.
fergie,"I guess you're out of friends, Dredd."
hershey,"Up against the wall, now! The figure complies. It's Fergie."
fergie,I'm with him. - =141; steps into the light.
hershey,Dredd! '_- a moment she's elated. Then her face hardens. She holds n steady. HERSHEY  Stay where you are.
dredd,Hershey. What is it - ?
hershey,"They're dying out-there, Dredd. A hundred and eight Judges in 48 hours. Everyone who's left is on triple shifts and pseudorphin. I thought it was organized criminals, revolutionaries, something... then I was a target."
dredd,You think I'm-part of this -
hershey,"I don't know what to think anymore. Dredd moves like lightning - pins her gun hand against the wall - then freezes. It's a challenge, not a threat. She glares at him - counter moves - gets an elbow against his throat! But Dredd doesn't break her hold - or turn the gun on her. It's deliberate check-mate on both their parts."
hershey,Secrets can hurt more than anything. She relaxes her hold on him. Throws something down.
hershey,And he's doing it again?
dredd,Him... and Griffin.
hershey,Griffin? We have to tell the Council - !
dredd,"The same. Inhuman. Defective. He just broke down, first."
hershey,No!
dredd,"How many times have you said I had no feelings, no emotions? Now you know why. "
entl,"Dredd.g Children were born in laboratories, even back in the twentieth century... test tube babies, in vitro fertilization. No one ever questioned their"
dredd,"It's not the same! They had parents, they embraced their humanity... they didn't hide it... fight it... question it!"
hershey,"Dredd. The Janus project didn't do that to you. You did that to yourself. He turns, startled. Realizes she's right."
dredd, Myself. Griffin. Fargo. Even Fergie. I've been wrong about so much...
hershey,"Never the Law, Dredd. Never the Law. That means more than anything else she can say to him. He looks into her eyes. Fergie comes in, ends the moment."
fergie,You can forget the terminal out here. We're gonna have to go somewhere else to get in the System.
dredd," Hershey. You just said I was never wrong about the Law. They took away my badge. I'm a convicted murderer. I have no authority any more - no legal authority. Pause. without the law as a safety net, Dredd is in uncharted emotional territory."
hershey,"I'd be honored. Dredd reaches over, squeezes her hand. There's absolutely nc:n.nc sexual about it - and that makes it even more powerful."
rico,"Slight change,. of plans, Central. I want to purge that DNA sample."
central,"DNA sample purged. If you wish to proceed with cloning, I will require a new sample."
ilsa,What are you doing?
rico,"The same thing you are: House-cleaning. Mock-annoyed, she throws a cleaning rag at him. She turns on he droid. It moves off, polishing the floor. Curious, she icins Rico."
central,"The sampling console is ready. rips his sleeve open to the elbow... sits down... puts his _.:rnec arm in a special steel hollow. CHUNG! CLAMPS close, ._s arm down. RICO  Central. Take DNA sample.. .now. DRILL LIKE DEVICE descends with a frightening grind -anc STABS right into his arm!"
central,New DNA sample being analyzed. Scanning. Ma;rix scan complete.
dredd's voice,"Central, I order you to give me the location of the Janus Lab, immediately! By now the CAMERA is in Olmeyer's student pod. Olmeyer,  Fergie and Hershey are in a corner, watching and whispering. : edd is on the other side of the cubicle, at a Central Station. ' r e's wearing his own helmet and badge again."
central,"I am sorry, but the location of the Janus Lab is classified information, accessible only to Chief Justice Griffin and Council Judge Rico."
central,"Actually, the onl Council Judge. Chief Justice Griffin promoted him so they could both use me to get the Janus Lab up and running."
dredd,You're helping them?
dredd,But they're breaking the law! Who the hell programmed you?
central,Lawyers.
dredd,Fine! I'll file charges!
hershey,Central. This is Judge Hershey. I hereby file formal charges of murder against Chief Justice Griffin and Council Judge Rico. And I order you to give me the location of the Janus Lab so that I may personally make the arrest!
central,"Certainly, Judge Hershey. However, as per Mega-City Code Section 84, Paragraph ""A"", I need authorization from the Chief Justice to arrest a Council Judge. Similarly, as stated in Paragraph ""B"", same Section, I need authorization from any Council Judges to arrest a Chief Justice. In this case, that would be Chief Judge Griffin and Council Judge Rico."
central,"Basically... yes. And without their authorization you cannot file charges, and without charges I cannot violate Security and tell you the location of the Lab."
dredd,"Fergie, you've got to have something - a password, a kluge -"
fergie,Central's a fuzzy A.I. - the best fuzzy A.I. ever built. If reasoning didn't work...  .nothing will.
dredd,"Come on, you cracked the food robot... the shuttle computer -"
fergie,"Simple systems, Dredd! Besides, I was scared."
dredd,Scared..?
fergie,"Well, yeah. Those were life or death situations. That's when my adrenalin shoots up and my brain goes into overtime - but you can't predict when that's gonna - Dredd grabs him, tucks him under his arm like a newspaper, and leaves the pod."
fergie,Hey! The others are so surprised it's a second before they follow. 
fergie,"Damn it, Dredd, Lemme down! I'm hitting every Goddamn - 2C ice:- - CLOSE 250 .. :his position, we can SEE the flash of inspiration on  s ""ace."
hershey,Central! I need to see the city power grid!
fergie, Tell it to scan around all the grid sections. Random selection.
hershey,"Scan through all the grid sections. Random selection. RAPID IMAGES now: Different neighborhoods of Mega-City, all depicted as COMPUTER GRAPHICS of color and pattern."
dredd, The Lab was top secret. It had to be in an out of the way place to stay secret. Right?
dredd,"Red Quad, Section 5: The oldest part of Mega-City. Olmeyer turns, looks off. "
central,It's probably just the Judge Hunters.
dredd,What?
central,"When I was off-line a moment ago, Judge Griffin asked me if I knew where you were. Naturally, I told him yes, and gave him your location."
hershey,What about you -
judge hunter,"You're under arrest, cadet. Anything you say will be held against you. Woozy from the blow to the head, Olmeyer nods, pleased. "
griffin,Dredd got away from the Hunters. He could be on his way here right now!
rico,"Don't worry. He's going to be seriously outnumbered. Right, Central?"
computer,"Correct, Council Judge Rico. The new DNA sample has been multi-plexed and the gametes are already dividing."
rico,"Hey, That old DNA was in there for over 30 years. Sooner or later you gotta clean out the fridge."
rico,Can you think of a better model? Sleek lines... strong chassis. Corners on the curves.
ilsa,I've test driven him. It's true.
griffin,"Rico. You don't know what you're doing! Software or wetware, when you make reproductions, there's always the danger of a defective copy! The last time, there was one perfect copy -"
rico,Me.
griffin,"Dredd! And one defective copy -Lou! You had a mutation, on the Y chromosone..."
rico,Yes. A mutat;on that made me the next step in human evolution.
griffin,A mutation that made you a genetic criminal!
rico,Really? What's your excuse?
griffin,"Rico, for God's sake, listen! You're a defective copy yourself! And now you're making more copies that will be even more mutated -more"
rico,"You're lying! All you care about is control! Well, the next batch of Janus Judges won't be the puppets you want... they'll be my brothers and sisters, mine to control!"
rico,Why not? I'm going to breed some more of me... the old fashioned way.
ilsa,I'd like to be a fly on that wall.
rico,You will be.
griffin,"My God. I never should have started this. Never. But now I'll finish it - . He draws his Lawgiver! But it has barely cleared the holster when the ABC robot grabs Griffin's wrist! It plucks the weapon from his han as if he's a child, hangs on to him!"
rico,Griffy. You shouldn't have done that. Fido is very loyal.
central,"I'm sorry, Chief Justice. The ABC robot is not tied into my main processor. Judge Rico has sole voice control."
rico,"That's right, Griff. You gotta get with this hi-tech stuff. Robot: Tear off Judge Griffin's arms and legs. Save his head for last. CAMERA ADJUSTS as Griffin SCREAMS with fear - and then, as we :GHTEN on Rico and Ilsa, and we SEE the horrible SHADOWS on t:ne wall, the screams become far, far worse. cc watches with wincing amusement, like a spectator at a par: cularly rough hockey game. :=sa watches with a sick fascination and awe. -:-:ally the screams and horrible wrenching sounds STOP. There's a T The robot returns to position, metal hands stained."
central,"Before we go on, um... may I assume that Judge Griffin has uh... retired from duty?"
rico,You may so assume.
central,"The clone incubators are on-line. The first batch of clones from your personal DNA can be hatched in eight hours. Chief Justice Rico, how many copies of you would you like?"
rico,Let's start with... a thousand. CAMERA ADJUSTS to show the INCUBATORS as they begin to fill with
fergie,This looks like a really bad neighborhood. I'll stay here and watch the bike -
fergie,I. knew you were gonna say that.
hershey,Down there. CAMERA ZOOMS BACK. They're on the artiall ruined HEAD of 
rico,Enough. Dredd. Drop your gun.
dredd,"No.  Edsel, here still has another"
rico,"Amusing. Robot. On a count of three... break Judge Hershey's neck. One... two... .e.: groaning, the Robot STANDS - tenses. Dredd throws down Remington beside Hershey's Lawgiver. Ilsa comes over to the V:ea=c^s. She picks up the REMINGTON... starts to reach for the"
rico,She's such a tease.
rico,He is a lot like me.
dredd,I'm nothing like you.
rico,"The only difference between us, Joseph, is that you destroyed your life when you embraced the Law. I destroyed the Law and embraced...- life !"
rico,"This is where we were born, brother! Can you feel the magic? Come... come, see where we began."
rico,Our brothers and sisters will be born in two hours. 60 today... 60 tomorrow. An endless supply of perfection to guard Mega-City forever.  birthright.
dredd,"You get nothing from me, Rico. You've betrayed the Law."
rico,"You... you dare mention betrayal to me? I was your friend. More then a friend! I was oyal to you... and you Judged me! You sent me up for nine years o frozen hell in Aspen! And you dare say ""betrayal"" to me? He raises his Lawgiver, aims it between Dredd's eyes."
rico, Dredd. Give me your word you'll help me raise the kids.
dredd,"When Aspen thaws, Rico. Go to hell. Tense seconds. Rico grins boyishly, lowers the gun."
rico,Aw. You knew I couldn't pull the trigger. we're family. He steps back. His face hardens. He SHOUTS.
astonished,"- until he SEES Fergie, hanging on the back of the his hands deep inside it working its circuits!"
hershey,Dredd! Catch! She throws the Remington 11sa dropped to Dredd!
fergie,Hack you... asshole. =erce slumps... lies still.
hershey,"You don't fight girls much, do you? She grabs Ilsa's ankle, flips her!"
dredd,Fergie.
dredd,I. I made a mistake. I... I'm sorry I misjudged you.
fergie,And you'll never arrest me again.
dredd,And I'll never arrest you again.
fergie,Damn straight. e dies. Dredd closes his eyes. CAMERA TIGHTENS on Dredd as nis face fills with fury. He SEES Hershey's Lawgiver on the --cor. Snatches it up! We CRANE UP with him as he COCKS it.
rico,"Central! Hatch the first set of clones, now!"
central,"The cloning process is not finished, Chief Justice Rico. The Clones will be only 60 per cent complete."
rico,"Fuck that, I need reinforcements! Hatch the Goddamn clones, now!"
central,Beginning hatching process... now.
camera rakes,to the incubators. They begin to open.
gun voice,All lethal rounds exhausted. Select.
gun voice,All lethal rounds exhausted. Select. Dredd is almost on top of him!
rico,"Central! Turn off overhead lighting! HUNK. The lights GO OUT. Rico grins, runs out of SHOT!"
dredd,Central! Can you - 
central,"Don't expect help from me, escaped-convict Dredd. I have  explained your legal standing repeatedly. I advise you to surrender."
dredd,"Okay, you win. I'll give myself up to Chief Justice Rico. Where is he?"
dredd,That's for Fargo! That's for the u Co ncil! That's for Fergie!
rico,This... this is how you repay me 
rico,And finally... to the charge of being human when you could have been a God... GUILTY. Rico nicks up the Lawgiver. Puts it right against Dredd's head.
gun voice,All lethal rounds exhausted. Select.
gun voice,DNA accepted. Select.
dredd,"Signal Flare! And as he SHOUTS it, he uses his last strength to smack the weapon away!"
hershey,Grenade. BLAM! The incubators EXPLODE.
dredd,.. It's over.
dredd,No. Just a Judge. I did my job. CAMERA ADJUSTS and we SEE that he is holding Fergie's body in ..z.s arms.
