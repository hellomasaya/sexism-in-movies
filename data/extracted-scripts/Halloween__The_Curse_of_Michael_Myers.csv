Speaker,Dialogue
halloween 6,"THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS  DARKNESS fills the SCREEN.  SUPERIMPOSE:  October 30, 1995  DEAD SILENCE for what seems like an eternity, followed by a startling, bone-chilling SCREAM as we  FADE IN:  INT. DUNGEON - TUNNELS - NIGHT   A rat scampers from a hole, foraging in the muck of a rotted rack.  A white sheet, saturated with blood, covers the parted legs of JAMIE LLOYD, now 16, cheeks flushed with perspiration."
jamie,"Oh, God, it's coming!  It's coming!  MARY, a young midwife, rushes in with a bowl of hot water.  Jamie lurches, knocking the bowl out of the girl's hands; it SHATTERS on the floor."
jamie," Mary, mother of God, please make it stop!  Mary's face is frozen in horror.  Jamie's SCREAMS build to an unnerving crescendo.  The paiin too much for her to bear."
jamie,Please ... give him to me ...  The infant is wrapped in black swaddling.  The wooden door CREAKS open.  Jamie's eyes fill with horror as the shadow of the Stranger fills the room.  Standing at the threshold.  Waiting to receive the child.
jamie," No, please ... my baby!  The dark sentinels march out in somber procession, ignoring her desperate pleas.  Torches lighting the way."
jamie, Damn you!!  Damn you all to hell!!!  Jamie's heartrending SHRIEKS are cut off by the cold sound of the SLAMMING DOOR.
halloween 6," The OPENING CREDITS are BRANDED against the BLACK SCREEN by an invisible, kenetic force, interspersed with a SERIES OF CUTS:  Jamie's baby is lain upon a primitive altar.  Ringed by eleven stones engraved with cryptic markings.  Hooded, faceless figures.  Torches held aloft.  Disembodied VOICES.  Whispering.  Invoking a dark spell.  MARY, the young midwife, peers around a corner.  Eyes glazed with horror.  Watching.  Spying.  The newborn SCREAMS.  The flattened blade of a dagger smears a triangular symbol in blood over the baby's torso.  We MOVE IN on this symbol, capturing it in FREEZE FRAME.  It burns off into fiery cinders, disintegrating into DARKNESS.  Silence.  Then a startling CLAP OF THUNDER as we"
kara,Danny!  The little boy holds onto her for dear life.  Crying hysterically.  Eyes clenched tightly.
kara, Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
danny,"The voice man!  He's here!  Kara looks in the direction he's pointing.  In the light there's just an antique coat rack -- ""dressed"" in a hat, rain jacket and old silver-tipped umbrella."
kara,"Danny, no one's there.  Danny dares to look -- but now only cries harder.  Kara carries Danny back to his room, averting the steely-eyed gaze of her father, JOHN STRODE, staunch, late 40s, wearing boxer shorts and a well-worn undershirt."
john,"Some of us have to get some sleep around here.  What's with that kid?  Kara ignores him as her mother, DEBRA, careworn face with compassionate eyes, tries to lend a hand."
debra,"Let me take him for you, Kara."
kara,"It's all right, Mom.  Go back to bed.  Debra sighs resignedly.  TIM, 18, stocky and streetwise, wearing torn red sweat pants and ""Ice-T"" t-shirt, casually replaces his Walkman headphones and returns to his room.  INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT   Kara opens the closet and switches on the light.  Satisfying Danny that it's empty, she breaks into her perfunctory routine."
kara,"Stay away monters, stay away ghouls. Stay away from Danny.  You jerks know the rules.  Better?  Danny giggles as his pretty young mother tucks him in."
danny,"Mommy, when can we go home?  Kara sighs.  They've been through this one before."
kara,Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
danny,The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
kara,"They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?"
danny,But I've seen him!
kara,You've been watching too much TV.
danny,He says things.  Bad things.
kara,Like what?  Danny is afraid to tell her.
kara," If you mean the things Grandpa says sometimes, ignore him.  Once he gets to know you he'll come around ... Let the bad things you hear slide right off your back.  Kara tousles his blond hair and kisses his forehead.  Then she goes to the closet, just about to turn out the light --"
danny," No, Mom -- keep it on!"
kara,"Okay ... But just for tonight.  Kara adjusts the closet door, causing one of Danny's school drawings to fly off the wall.  She picks it up on her way out."
kara,"  Kara yawns, removes her glasses and rubs her eyes, setting Danny's drawing on a pile of open books.  Cliffs Notes and Diet Coke cans.  Telltale signs of a late-night cram session.  Adjusting the dial on her FM/alarm clock, Kara begins to move about the little room, slipping out of her clothes as the subtly-seductive voice of a WOMAN comes over the radio:"
tommy,"My name's Tommy.  I was only eight- years-old when I saw him.  But I was lucky.  I survived.  Tommy paces nervously around his sparsely-furnished attic apartment.  Classic horror movie one-sheets and mint first edition comic books share wall space with a chilling array of guns, knives, and survivalist weapons."
tommy,"Michael's work isn't finished in Haddonfield. Now it's just a matter of time before he comes home to kill again.  But this time I'll be ready.  MOVE IN TIGHT on the headline, frail and yellowed by age: ""November 1, 1978.  TOMMY DOYLE SURVIVES BABYSITTER BLOODBATH."" Directly beneath this:  ""November 3, 1989.  JAMIE LLOYD FEARED DEAD IN POLICE STATION MASSACRE.""  CLOSE ON a photograph of young Jamie and"
mary,"Come with me if you want to save your baby.  Jamie can't believe her eyes.  Mary opens a threadbare knapsack -- revealing the baby inside!  A soul-shuddering RUMBLE echoes throughout the cavern.  Jamie leaps up, eyes wide with fear, sensing the evil presence."
jamie,"Oh, God ... He's coming!"
mary,We've got to move.  Now!
mary,There!  It's that way!
jamie,No --
mary,Save your baby -- go now!
motorist,"Shit!  Fingers burning, he searches the glove compartment for a napkin."
dwayne,"  Tires SCREECH.  The pickup stops on a dime.  The Motorist just sits there, mouth agape as the shrieking girl throws open the door and clambers into the passenger seat."
jamie,"Drive!  Goddamnit, drive!  Through his side-view mirror, the unsuspecting Motorist sees the outline of a quickly-approaching man.  Unrolling his window, he rubbernecks a look outside."
motorist,"Hey, what do you think you're --"
loomis,"Not dead.  Just very much retired.  Loomis hobbles to the desk and finishes cutting out a newspaper article.  As he arranges the strips of paper in a leather-bound scrapbook, a sudden KNOCK at the door gives him a startle.  EXT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT   An ominous FIGURE, clad in hat and trench coat, stands beneath the glowing porch light, silhouetted in the pouring RAIN.  Loomis opens the door, eyes straining in the semi-darkness, trying to identify his unexpected visitor."
loomis,"  Shuffling inside, dripping with rain, DR. TERENCE WYNN, a well-dressed gentleman in his 50s, removes his hat and coat, quickly making himself at home by the crackling fire."
wynn,"Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!"
loomis,"That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.  Wynn heads for the kitchen, rummaging through cabinets and drawers as Loomis dutifully wipes up his muddy trail."
loomis,"And in all these years, I've never known you to make house calls, Dr. Wynn.  Especially at this hour ...  Wynn returns with a bottle of Irish whiskey and two shot glasses. Thrusts one in Loomis's hand and begins to pour."
wynn,"Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink."
loomis,I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
wynn,"As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff."
loomis,But surely Rogers isn't --
wynn,Retiring.  Loomis is abruptly stunned and delighted by the news.
loomis,Why -- congratulations!  I can think of no one better suited for the position.  The two old sparring partners drink to the occasion.  But Wynn's angle soon comes to the helm.
wynn,"Of course, I need a new Administrator. Someone who can bring new life -- and some old blood, if you'll pardon the expression -- back to our program ...  Loomis prepares himself for the bomb."
wynn," We need you, Dr. Loomis."
loomis,You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
wynn,"You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left.  I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change to finally make a difference.  Loomis scratches his head and settles down into his comfortable easy chair, amused at the irony of Wynn's speech."
loomis,"Even after my stroke six years ago they practically had to hold a gun to my head to get me to retire.  Now things have changed. I've changed.  The ghosts have been buried. Why on earth would I want to dig them up again?  Loomis finally looks over at Wynn, surprised to find him standing at the desk, looking through his scrap book."
wynn,"Seems to me there's at least one ghost that's still lurking in your closet.  We follow Wynn's gaze down toward the open page.  A blazing tabloid headline:  ""MICHAEL MYERS - DEAD OR ALIVE?"""
jamie,"God ... Help us, please ...  Something up ahead.  Jamie's face fills with expectancy.  JAMIE'S P.O.V. - THROUGH WINDSHIELD  A lighted sign appears out of the darkness.  Glowing salvation. Familiar red-white-and-blue logo.  ""GREYHOUND.""  EXT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT  The pickup drives into the glow of orange vapor lights.  SKIDS to a stop in a deserted parking lot.  Jamie staggers out, cradling the knapsack as she runs toward the old depot.  INT. BUS DEPOT - NIGHT  Jamie blasts through double glass doors.  But the bus station is devoid of life.  Empty benches.  Blank ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE signboard.  The low hum of vending machines.  Jamie moves toward the ticket counter.  A handwritten sign left by the attendant:  ""BACK IN 20.""  Shivering, holding her baby, Jamie enters an old-fashioned phone"
wynn,"But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over."
loomis,"Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.  As Wynn continues to talk, his voice trailing off into nothingness, Loomis's attention is diverted to the VOICES on the radio."
tall man,"Are you all right, young lady?"
jamie,"No!!!  EXT. PUMPKIN PATCH   The pickup rockets at breakneck speed toward the edge of the field. Suddenly --  JAMIE'S P.O.V.  The Shape stands in the field, tall and unmoving, white mask glowing hideously in the rush of oncoming headlights.  BACK TO SCENE  The truck plows into the Shape, dragging it under, SLAMMING headlong into the trunk of a huge oak tree.  Everything is abruptly and shockingly silent.  Like a phantom in the night, the van is gone.  The Shape nowhere to be seen.  Steam billows from the pickup, engine TICKING, a heap of shattered glass and mangled steel.  Pinned against the base of the tree is a shape in human form -- a scarecrow!  MOVE IN on Jamie, face-down against the steering wheel.  Coughing on the noxious fumes, she stirs back to life.  Slowly, painfully, she shoulders the door.  Falls onto the ground.  A SPARK ignites.  BLINDING FLASH as the gas tank EXPLODES, setting the truck ablaze.  Jamie turns, her face a frozen rictus of horror. Debris rains down on her.  Suddenly a grim shadow rises from the field.  The Shape -- wielding an enormous butcher knife!  Jamie rolls onto her back, SCREAMING."
jamie,No -- NO!!!
john,"Enough ...  ... shit!  Suddenly the sign crashes down -- and ""Michael Myers"" with it.  The kids huddle.  John turns on them, brandishing the axe."
john," You stinkin' kids got three seconds to get the hell off my property!  One, two --  That's all it takes.  The kids scatter, tripping over one another as they tear off down the black.  Satisfied with himself, John stubs out his cigarette and hauls the sign and its now-headless rider to the trash.  Then he trudges up the porch steps, dropping the axe as he enters the house.  Uttering oaths under his breath.  BOOM UP over the surrounding neighborheed.  SUPERIMPOSE:  ""Haddonfield, Illinois.  Halloween.""  Last night's storm has given way to an incredibly bright and picturesque morning.  CHILDREN pour out of their homes, bursting with excitement, dressed in colorful costumes.  Even the Myers house, with its trimmed hedges and fresh coat of paint, somehow manages to look invite.  A white van slowly rolls up the street.  WKNB logo, streamers and a large orange banner proclaiming:  ""HADDONFIELD JUNIOR COLLEGE HARVEST FAIRE '95 - See Harry Simms Live - October 31.""  A now-familiar voice booms over loudspeaker:"
loomis,It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
wynn,You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
loomis,"It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well."
wynn,"After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --"
loomis,"That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.   Gold insignia on mahogany doors:  ""TERENCE WYNN - CHIEF OF STAFF.""  Wynn and Loomis stride through a plush reception area.  DAWN, an attractive, high-energy secretary, keeps pace, taking notes, handing Wynn his briefcase, phone messages, etc."
wynn,"Cancel all my appointments.  Get Dr. Loomis anything he needs -- files, tests, records of every treatment ever administered to a former patient of ours -- Michael Myers."
dawn, Michael Myers?  Wynn stops abruptly before heading out the door.
wynn,That's right.  We think there's a very good chance he might still be alive.
wynn," If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back."
loomis,"Or what's left of him.  They cut down a sub-passageway and out a fire exit.  EXT. SANITARIUM - LANDING FIELD   Loomis and Wynn dash across a windswept field where a Smith's Grove medical transport helicopter awaits them.  The deafening WHINE of spinning rotors as a TECHNICIAN refuels.  The doctors step inside.  The doors close and the helicopter lifts off, rising high above the cluster of the white coats below."
tim,"Bro', I knew Harry when we lived in the city. Don't worry -- he'll be there. We've got everything arranged.  Get with me tonight at the fair and I'll hook you up.  Peace.  Tim hangs up, guzzling down his shake as Debra navigates around him, setting out the breakfast dishes as Kara tries to study.  John, dressed in what might be a respectable business suit if it fit him better, mutters grumpily as he pours himself a cup of coffee."
john,Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
debra,"Relax, John.  They were just kids."
john,"Kids are what's ruining this country. Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn respect.  Tim lets out a huge BELCH as he finishes drinking his breakfast."
john, See what I'm talkin' about?
debra,"You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.  Debra snatches the book out of Kara's hands."
debra, Cognitive Therapy and Emotional Disorders? What are they teaching in college these days? The art of going crazy?
kara," It's called psychology, Mom.  Living in this house is what's driving me crazy."
john,"Who the hell told you to come live here in the first place?  Kara rises, collects her books, trying to avoid a confrontation."
kara,I'd better get Danny to school.
john,"She don't show her face for five years, then expects us to roll out the red carpet.  You think going to college is gonna make up for your mistakes, girl?"
debra,"John, please don't --"
tim,"Yo', just lay off her, Dad.  Suddenly Danny runs in, showing off in his dinosaur costume. ROARING loudly.  Startling John."
john,What the fuck --  Kara immediately seizes Danny's hand and ushers him toward the back door.
kara,"Let's go, Danny."
debra,"Kara, wait.  John.  Can't we all just sit down?  Try to be a family for once?"
kara,"I'm sorry, Mom.  Debra reaches into her purse and hands Kara a couple of dollars."
john,"That's it, Debra, keep slipping her the cash. While you're at it, why don't you just give her all our goddamn money?!  John explodes, dumping the entire contents of her purse onto the floor.  Debra recoils.  Kara steps in.  Danny is terrified."
kara,"Stay away from her, you bastard."
john, I only see one bastard in this house.  Kara flies at him with Medea-like rage.  John instantly grabs her by the neck and shoves her violently against the counter.
tim,Dad!  Let her go!
debra,John!  Stop it!  Stop it!  Danny looks outside.  Frozen in horror.  A VOICE whispers.
john,"You ever raise your hand to me again, I'll kill you, you understand?  John looks down to see the tip of a butcher knife pointed at his groin.  Danny is holding it -- his eyes dark, emotionless.  Ever so slowly, John releases Kara.  Debra and Tim watch in horrified astonishment.  Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the back door.  Kara dives toward Danny.  The knife clatters to the floor as she picks him up, grabs her book bag and hurtles outside.  EXT. MYERS HOUSE - BACK YARD   BETH, 19, very ""retro,"" cute in the waifish sense -- milky white skin, two-tone hair and a dangling nose ring --is nearly bowled off the back porch as Kara and Danny fly out the door."
beth,"Make way for the Hardin County Express.  Hey, where's Tim?  We're supposed to go over the list of events for tonight --  Beth is taken aback when she sees the bruise on Kara's neck."
beth, He do that to you?
kara,Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
beth,"Pig.  What the hell happened this time?  Suddenly Tim jumps out from behind a clothesline, locking his arms around Beth, attacking her with kisses."
beth," Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do."
tim,"Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.  Beth shoves the clipboard at him, a champion of her cause."
beth,"How many times o I have to tell you? It's not about Halloween.  It's about being political. There are too many people with corn-cobs up their ass in this town telling us what we can and can't do.  If we want change, it's up to us to set an example.  INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN   Debra is on the floor, stifling her tears, putting things back in her purse.  John stares coldly out the window."
john,"I want her and that kid out of here tonight.  Debra rises, facing him scornfully."
debra,"I thought inheriting your father's house ... the business ... moving out here might change things.  But you're still the same, John.   Tim lifts Danny into the back seat of Beth's convertible VW Bug -- plastered with ""Greenpeace"" and ""This is Your Brain on Drugs"" bumper stickers.  Kara and Beth in front."
tim,Whatever happened to women in back?
beth,"Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.  Pulling away from the curb, Beth honks at MRS. BLANKENSHIP, at least 80, owner of the student boarding house across the street."
beth," See you tonight, Mrs. Blankenship!  The old woman just stares forward.  A gardem hose in hand as she waters a garden of long-dead flowers.  Kara shields her eyes, distracted, looking up at the old Victorian house.  KARA'S P.O.V.  Beth drives down a shady, tree-lined avenue, unaware of the white van that is following them."
kara,"Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?"
beth,Why?  You interested?
kara,No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
beth,"You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.  Tim leans forward, ravaging Beth's neck."
tim,Or horny.
kara,"Tim, do you always have to act like such an asshole?"
tim,"Only when you're around to dump on ... Hey, chill, sis.  I'm just doggin' ya.  Suddenly the van ROARS by and cuts them off.  Beth lays on the HORN.  Slams on the brakes.  Narrowly avoiding a collision."
beth,"Speed kills, asshole!  Suddenly the van swerves around to face the VW head on.  For a breathless moment the van and the VW sit at opposite ends of the intersection.  Idling.  A tense stand-off."
kara,Who is that ...  Kara strains to get a look at the van's driver.  A momentary glimpse of a pale white face behind the wheel.
beth," I've got my pepper spray.  Danny sits frozen in the back seat.  Suddenly the van shoots forward, tires SCREAMING.  Startled GASPS.  The van turns off sharply at the last second, SCREECHING down the next block."
tim, Happy fuckin' Halloween.
beth,"Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.  Beth drives on, grimly determined.  Kara looks back at Danny.  He returns her frightened gaze.  INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - DAY  Tommy paces in his cramped apartment.  Dark circles under his eyes. A remote control in hand, reviewing his recording of last night's Harry Simms broadcast:"
attendant,"Can I help you, sir?"
tommy,Can you tell me if a bus arrived from Russellville last night?  The Attendant checks her roster.
attendant,Sure did.  About seven hours ago.  You lookin' for someone --
tommy, Thank you.
tommy,"Jesus ...  The helpless newborn kicks and CRIES, the triangular symbol of Thorn still caked in blood over his tiny torso.  SUBJECTIVE P.O.V.  Someone partially opens the door, peering in from the hallway as Tommy removes his jacket and bundles the baby inside."
tommy,"Okay, little guy.  You're okay."
wynn, What is that?
loomis,It's a sign.  He's come home.
deputy,"Sir, you'll have to step back."
loomis,Please.  I need to see the sheriff.
wynn,Official business.  Wynn flashes his badge.  The Deputy gives them a vexed glance.
deputy,"Wait here.  Loomis's eyes flicker with nervous anticipation.  The Deputy whispers something to SHERIFF JIM HOLDT, a brooding giant of a man who dons a Stetson, holstered .44 Special and steel-toed boots that give new meaning to the term ""bad ass.""  Even Loomis steps back as the sheriff lumbers toward them."
loomis, You must be Sheriff Holdt.  Holdt responds by stubbing out his Marlboro at Loomis's foot.
holdt,"As a matter of fact, I am.  And I take it you're the infamous Dr. Loomis."
loomis,"I'd like to introduce you to Terence Wynn, the Chief of Staff at --"
holdt,Smith's Grove.  They told me you'd be coming. Now I suggest you fly right on back to your crackpot asylum.  You people got no business in my town.
loomis,Michael Myers is my business.  Holdt towers above him.
holdt,"I want you to listen and listen good, Loomis. Things have been quiet for six years and that's the way they're gonna stay.  The last thing we need is you spouting off your ghost stories.  As usual, Loomis isn't easily intimidated."
loomis,"I suppose it was a ghost that did all this.  A ghost who called the radio station last night. Maybe that same ghost is lying over there right now.  Holdt fumes, ready to boil when --"
deputy,"Sheriff!  She's alive!  Holdt and Loomis wade through the crush of paramedics, running alongside the stretcher being whisked toward an ambulance.  A large knife extruding from a girl's stomach, packed under sterile gauze.  Skin pasty-white.  Lips blue from shock."
loomis,Dear God ... Jamie!
tim,"Yo, check it out.  They've been lining up all night just to see Harry.  You lose your mind in that thing, Kara?  Kara is nervously rifling through her enormous book bag."
kara,I can't find my term paper.
tim,"So copy someone else's.  I do it all the time. Works primo.  Armed with her clipboard, Beth is assailed by her COMMITTEE. Inundating her with QUESTIONS."
beth,"Give us victory or give us death.  See you tonight, Kara!  Tim and Beth are swept away.  A large sheet of paper falls out of Kara's bag.  She picks it up, startled by what she sees.  KARA'S P.O.V. - THE DRAWING  Crayola figures of Grandma, Grandpa, Uncle Tim, and Mommy.  Knives piercing them.  Blood dripping.  Mouths screaming.  A black shadow figure bearing the word ""THORN.""  On the flip side, the drawing she found last night.  Danny's scribbling of the odd triangular symbol.  BACK TO SCENE  The horrifying images send chills up Kara's spine."
kara,"Thorn ...  Lost in grim reverie, Kara walks on, oblivious to the activity all around her ...  A banner hangs from the eaves of the library:  ""HADDONFIELD JR. COLLEGE - FIRST ANNUAL HARVEST FAIRE.""  Tim and Beth supervise as preparations for tonight's event get underway.  STUDENT VOLUNTEERS nailing together booths, hanging decorations.  A half-assembled Ferris wheel, a merry-go-round, an ominous-looking House of Horrors.  Rounding the corner onto the quiet path behind the library, Kara suddenly finds herself alone.  WIND whips at her hair.  She glances over her shoulder, as if sensing a presence.  KARA'S P.O.V.  No one is there.  Just the rustling of leaves on the ground.  ANGLE ON KARA  Walking off in the distance.  Suddenly the Shape steps shockingly into FRAME, watching her disappear around the corner."
paramedic,"Penetrating abdominal trauma.  Massive blood loss.  We've given her two units of O-negative stat and dextran.  BP sixty.  Pulse one-twenty ... Somehow she pulled through out there all night!  DR. BONHAM, the ER resident, peels off the sheet, exposing a dark sea of blood around the enormous knife still jutting from Jamie's stomach.  Bonham stares, incredulous."
wynn,"Sam, don't -- let them take care of her."
loomis,"I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.  HOSPITAL ENTRANCE / ADMITTANCE DESK  Pneumatic doors fly open.  Tommy bursts through, holding the baby in his jacket.  PATIENTS and COPS everywhere.  He hones in on the NURSE behind the admittance desk."
tommy,I need to see a doctor.
nurse,What seems to be the problem?
tommy,I-it's a baby -- my baby.  There's been -- been an accident.
nurse,What kind of an accident?
tommy, Just get me a doctor right now!
wynn,There's nothing more you can do for her.  The shrill sound of Wynn's beeper.  He clicks it.
wynn, I'll be right back.  Wynn disappears around the corner.  Loomis wanders off alone.
loomis,Yes?
tommy,"Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie."
loomis,"I'm sorry, but do I know you --"
tommy,I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --  Loomis suddenly recognizes him.  It's been a very long time.
loomis,Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
tommy,Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?  Loomis pulls Tommy aside into an empty alcove.
loomis,What do you know about Michael?
tommy,I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
loomis,Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
tommy," No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.  Tommy hesitates.  Loomis's eyes are drawn enigmatically to the infant in Tommy's arms."
tommy," Oh, God -- his cousins.  The Strodes. They're living in the Myers house!  Loomis's face flls with horror.  Tommy sees the Admittance Nurse, flanked by a pair of security guards, walking his way."
tommy, I gotta go.  Tommy bolts toward the exit.  Loomis tries to stop him.
loomis,"Tommy, wait!  But he is gone.  A hand taps Loomis's shoulder; he reels.  Wynn."
wynn,There you are.  Who was that boy?
loomis,An old friend.  Darkness fills Loomis's countenance as we
debra,"Great.  Frustrated, Debra looks down to see a large puddle of water forming on the floor.  INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER   Debra hauls a laundry basket upstairs, filled with wet sheets.  She turns, startled.  The front door is standing wide open.  Just as she goes to shut it, a man steps out from the living room behind her.  She gasps, dropping the basket; it's Loomis."
loomis,"I'm very sorry, Mrs. Strode.  Debra shudders at the sight of the beguiling, wide-eyed man."
loomis, I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?
debra, Who are you?
loomis,"I've come to help your family.  Debra steps aside as Loomis walks in right past her.  Holding a valuminous file bearing the name ""MICHAEL AUDREY MYERS."""
tommy,"Shhh.  Okay, okay, Kyle.  You like that name? Yeah, I think it suits you.  Quickly he scans the directions on the formula.  Pours the liquid into a bottle, nukes it in the microwave, then returns to the business at hand.  Tommy grimaces at the mess inside his leather bomber.  The baby CRIES harder."
tommy,"  Tommy finishes securing the diaper.  The baby in his arms, he tests the formula's temperature and feeds him.  The infant sucks voraciously.  The crying stops.  Tommy rocks him gently."
tommy,"It's okay, big guy.  Don't you worry. I'm gonna take care of you."
loomis,"Michael Myers was just six-years-old when he stabbed his sister to death in 1963.  Here in this house.  For the next fifteen years, I became obsessed with finding out what was living inside of him.  He was my lift's work and my ultimate failure.  I knew what he was but I never knew why."
ian,"Who's my next victim?  The other kids make way as Danny takes the empty spot on the tetherball court, sitting face-to-face with the inplacable Ian.  Danny says nothign as he places his bet and slams the stack of Pogs.  Ian glowers.  Easy money.  The showdown begins."
loomis,He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
debra, What makes you think he'll come here again?
loomis,"This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter."
debra,Jamie?  But I thought she was --
loomis,Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
ian,"Double or nothing.  Danny pushes over the stack, nothing incisive in his manner.  Ian retorts, angrily slamming his Pogs."
ian," Look how he sits there.  Little freak. Just like the bogeyman who used to live in his house.  Are you the bogeyman, Danny?  Ian trumps Danny's hand and smiles haughtily.  The low, whispering VOICE which only Danny can hear RUMBLES in his mind."
ian,"You crazy little freak!!!  Ian goes berserk, leaping out at Danny like an enraged lion.  The kids cheer him on as a full-fledged playground brawl ensues.  Danny breaks away.  Runs.  With an amazing burst of strength, he swings a tetherball.  Th ball CRACKS Ian right between his eyes, laying the bully flat on his ass."
debra,What should I do?
loomis,Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
debra,God ... this can't be true.
loomis,"Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.  Loomis grips her hand reassuringly, then heads out the door.  Debra turns the deadbolt, securing it with the chain lock.  She collapses against the wall, tears of horror in her eyes."
john, Strode Realty.  INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN  Debra on the other end.  Tears reddening her cheeks.
debra,"John, it's me.  Something terrible has happened.  INTERCUT their conversation."
john,What is it this time?
debra,"A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.  John stiffens, slowly sits down behind his desk."
debra, He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
john,What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
debra," John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!"
john,"What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?"
debra,"I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us."
john," Debra, you're fuckin' insane."
debra,"You knew, didn't you, John?  You knew.  A CLICK as the line suddenly goes DEAD.  John scowls, opens his lower desk drawer, produces a bottle of JD and a small glass.  He blows off dust and begins to pour."
john,"Trick-or-treat to you, too."
debra,"Hello?  A startling, intensely whispering VOICE:"
debra,"Oh, God ...  Debra races back into the foyer and struggles with the door.  In her panic, she can't release the chain lock.  She turns to see the Shape standing right behind her!  Debra SCREAMS.  Breaks for the hall.  Through the kitchen.  Flings open the back door.  EXT. BACK YARD - DAY   Debra half-runs, half-stumbles through the endless rows of clotheslines.  White sheets twist around her like ghosts in the blustering WIND.  She tosses them aside, one after the other. Approaching the driveway.  Safety up ahead.  Whipping aside the last sheet, Debra finds herself staring into the Shape's death mask.  Her eyes bug.  Too late to scream.  The missing axe swings at her like a sledge hammer.  Blood paints the sheets red as we"
kara,"Mom, I'm home ... Hello?  No response.  Puzzled, she steps off the porch and makes her way around the side of the house, CAMERA FOLLOWING as she peers into the windows along the way.  BACK YARD   Kara walks along the billowing clotheslines, passing the blank spot where the blood-stained sheets were -- and are no longer.  She reaches the back door.  Standing ajar."
kara,"Mom?  Casting one last glance across the yard, she steps inside.  INT. MYERS HOUSE - KITCHEN   The room is quickly falling into darkness.  The eeriness almost palpable.  Kara advances into the living room, eyes roaming."
kara,"Mom? ... Danny?  Nothing.  Kara moves into the foyer.  Her mother's suitcase still sitting there.  Beyond, the cellar door stands wide open.  Kara moves toward it, peering into blackness.  A sudden CRASH from upstairs.  Kara jerks the door closed and looks up the deeply-shadowed staircase."
kara, Mom?  Are you there?
kara,Who the hell are you?  The man watching over Danny turns toward Kara.  It's Tommy.
tommy,"I-I'm your neighbor from across the street.  My name's Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Panicked, Kara makes a wall of herself between Tommy and Danny.  The little boy isn't the least bit fazed."
kara,"What are you doing with my son? Where's my mother?  Tommy backs off a tick, calmly trying to explain."
tommy,She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
kara," Danny, go downstairs -- Now!  Danny finally looks up, exasperated."
danny,Tommy's my new friend.  We've been playing 'til you got home.  He knows all about dinosaurs.  One look at Danny's black eye and Kara goes ballistic.
kara,"My, God!  What have you done to him?"
tommy,I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
kara,You stay away from him!  Kara starts to drag Danny away by the arm.  He resists angrily.
danny,"It wasn't Tommy!  It was the voice man.  Kara sees Tommy hunkering down in the corner, lifting something out of a crate -- a makeship crib.  He turns, his expression very grave.  Holding the baby."
tommy,I want you to listen very carefully to everything I'm about to tell you.  Kara's face is a melange of wonder and fear as we
jamie,"Please, Michael ... Help me.  Suddenly a long SHADOW fills the room.  The P.O.V. becomes more restless as the Stranger glides toward Jamie and disrobes.  The figures close the circle.  Jamie SCREAMS in terror.  The Shape's hands SLAM violently against the iron bars, a horrific SHUDDER of metal as we"
beth,Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
tim,Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?  The limo crawls into the parking lot.  A stampede of overzealous FANS surge past them.
beth,That's what worries me.
loomis, Any word on the location of the Strodes?
loomis,Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.  Suddenly Loomis is waylaid by a giant wall of a man -- Sheriff Holdt.  Loomis meets his fiery gaze.
holdt,"I'm warning you, Loomis -- stay out of my way. You may have had free reign when Ben Meeker was sheriff, God rest his soul, but I'm in charge now.  And I'm not about to stand by and watch you turn this night into some kind of sadistic witch hunt."
loomis, What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
tommy,"Quiet around here tonight, huh, Mrs. B.?  As usual, the senile old woman doesn't reply."
kara,"  The door opens.  Kara is repulsed by the sight of Tommy's musty, unkempt apartment."
danny,"Mom, I want to go to the fair ..."
kara, You can't expect us to stay here --  Tommy adjusts the blinds on the window looking out on the Myers house.
tommy,"I want you to watch your house.  You can see everything from this window.  Kara glares, reminded of last night."
kara,Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
tommy,"Him.  Tommy flashes a newspaper article in front of her.  One we've seen eariler:  ""MICHAEL MYERS - DEAD OF ALIVE?""  The baby's SCREAMS are verging on overload.  Tommy dashes to the recessed kitchen area and heats up another bottle.  As Kara reads, Danny tugs at his mother's blouse."
danny,"Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!"
kara," Danny, you're just going to have to wait!  Danny plods off.  Kara hands Tommy a nipple for the bottle.  Their eyes lock for a beat.  He takes it."
tommy,"Shhh.  It's okay, Kyle.  Just give me one more --  -- second.  There you go, big guy.  Kara looks on as Tommy attempts to feed the baby.  Despite his clumsiness, she's undeniably moved.  Behind them, Danny's imagination kicks into high gear as he drives a Power Ranger over an invisible race track.  On the floor.  Across the windowsill.  Glancing across the street.  DANNY'S P.O.V. - THE MYERS HOUSE  Standing below on the front lawn is the Shape, silhouetted under a moonlit tree.  Looking right at Danny.  BACK TO SCENE  Danny backs away, terrified.  Tommy and Kara are too concerned with the baby to notice."
tommy,"God, what's wrong with him?"
kara,"Here.  Let me try.  Tommy gingerly hands the baby over to her.  Instantaneously, Kyle's CRIES subside."
kara," There.  All it takes is a mother's touch.  For one fleeting moment, Tommy and Kara find themselves smiling at one another.  Unaware as Danny glides silently out the door. Tommy's expression darkens once again.  A man possessed."
tommy,Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
kara,Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
tommy,"Not just Kyle.  All of you.  His entire family.  Here.  Look at this.  Tommy opens the baby's quilt, revealing the blood mark smeared over his torso.  Kara's face registers terrified recognition."
tommy, It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
kara,It's a rune ... Thorn.
loomis,"Jamie ... I failed you again.  I never should have left you.  He spins, pouncing on Sheriff Holdt."
loomis, Now will you do something?!  How many more innocent people have to die?!  Wynn restrains him.  Pulls him away.  The sheriff doesn't budge.
wynn,"Don't do this to yourself, Sam.  Let's go. Come on.  Wynn ushers Loomis out of the room.  Holdt stares apathetically.  HALLWAY   Wynn tries to calm Loomis down.  Jamie's doctor approaches."
wynn,What is it?
loomis,You let it get to her.  How could you?
loomis,God in heaven.  You don't tell me she was --
wynn,Then where's her baby?  Jamie's covered body is wheeled out past them.  Loomis regards Wynn with a look of abject fear.
loomis,I think I may already know ...
kara,"Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic."
tommy,"Black magic ...  'In ancient times, Thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. Translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the Celtic celebration of Samhain.'"
kara,Halloween.
tommy,"'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'  Tommy jumps up, frantically moving around the apartment, collecting his jacket, his keys -- a gun."
kara, Where are you going?
tommy,"To find the rest of your family before Michael Myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.  An ominous CLICK as Tommy loads a cartridge into his gun.  He bolts toward the door.  Finds it standing wide open.  Kara freezes, noticing for the first time that Danny is missing."
kara,"Oh, God -- Where's Danny? Kara flies down the hall, the baby in her arms.  Tommy moves out right behind her.  INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - LOBBY   Kara and Tommy barrel downstairs, searching frantically."
kara,Danny?!  Danny!
tommy,"Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --  They find Mrs. Blankenship and Danny sitting side by side, watching the Horrorthon.  A bowl of popcorn between them."
kara," Danny, don't ever walk off without telling me where you're going!  Danny looks at her.  A blank, hollow stare.  The old woman's eyes glitter madly."
tommy,"Take the kids upstairs, lock the door and wait for me.   The car parks.  Sits in silence.  Suddenly the driver's side door opens, emblazoned with the ""Strode Realty"" emblem.  John spills out, collar unbuttoned, tie dangling.  Picking himself up, he staggers out of the garage.  Laughing.  Singing."
john,"... Pretty woman, walking down the street ... Pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet.  EXT. MYERS HOUSE   FOLLOW John's circuitous route across the front lawn, stumbling over one of Danny's toys on his way up the porch steps."
john,"Damn kid ... this is my house ...  John fumbles wth his key, estimates the location of the lock.  He turns the knob -- but the door's jammed.  Chain-locked."
john,  John sways in through the back door and flicks on a light.  Strains for lucidity.  No one in the kitchen.
john,Debra -- I'm home!  No answer.  John shrugs and moves to the stove.  Opens the lid on a pasta cooker.  Nothing inside.
john," Work all day and not even any supper ...  Frustrated, John opens the freezer and removes a frozen dinner. Tears open the box and pops it in the microwave.  Then he flounders down the dark alley, knocking picture frames awry.  LIVING ROOM / FOYER  Darkness, save for a glowing jack-o'-lantern.  John stands there, listing.  Bewildered.  Then he switches on a lamp, kicks off his shoes and crashes onto his lumpy old recliner."
john,"All right ... You can all come out now ...  Still no reply.  John sneers, flicks on the television with the remote control and settles back into his chair.  INSERT - TELEVISION  A scene from another horror movie.  A boy shreds his pumpkin mask as a mass of beetles and snakes pour out of his skull.  BACK TO SCENE"
john,What is this shit?
john,So this is the game you wanna play. Fine.  Go ahead.  Keep it up all night ...
john,"Is that you, you little brat?  Danny?!  John rises, about to go for him when suddenly the power cuts out -- and the entire house is plunged into blackness."
john," When I get my hands on you, kid, you're gonna wish you were never born!  John pulls a rechargeable flashlight from the wall and goes to the cellar door.  It stands open.  An invitation to enter."
john,"  John tentatively descends the stairs.  Barefoot.  The flashlight beam preceding his every step.  A RUMBLING below.  The cellar is lit only by a shaft of moonlight cutting through the single dusty window.  John probes around, shining the flashlight over cobwebs, boxes -- the puddle of water at his feet.  Now flooding the entire floor.  John SLOSHES through the water toward the washing machine -- which is running at full tact."
john,"What the hell --  He opens the washer lid and lifts out a water-logged sheet.  It drips red onto the white appliance -- blood.  John backs away, loses his footing, and slips in the water -- landing right at the Shape's feet.  John SCREAMS as the Shape grabs him by the neck, lifts him off the floor with one hand, then carries him across the basement and SLAMS him brutally against the open fuse box.  The Shape's free hand lifts an enormous butcher knife.  A loud WHAP as it's driven to the hilt into John's chest, through the fuse box. Sparks wain from the wall.  Electricity courses through John's writing body.  EXT. MYERS HOUSE   John's toes curl.  The skin around where the knife penetrates FRIES.  The Shape steps back, head tilted, BREATHING steadily, curiously observing John's hanging, lifeless body."
harry simms, I'm here with Tim and Beth -- the organizers of tonight's event.  How does it feel knowing you've finally pulled Halloween out of the closet?
tim," Yo, Harry, it's great!  And having you here with us is dope.  Totally raw. You're the ultimate juice!"
harry simms,I'll remember that the next time my wife tells me I didn't make her climax.
beth," What Tim means is that we've taken a firm stand against censorship.  Not only for Haddonfield, but for every town in the nation.  Our generation will not let the powers-that-be control our minds, dictate what clothes we wear, what music we listen to, or what holidays we celebrate.  Beth's rousing speech is met by gales of enthusiastic CHEERS."
harry, Have you ever considered running for public office?
kara,"Mrs. Blankenship, what did you mean about the little boy who used to live across the street?  The old woman doesn't seem to hear her.  Lost in her own world."
kara," Mrs. Blankenship, please.  This is important!  Mrs. Blankenship looks up sharply, startling Kara."
kara,What voice?  What are you talking about?
tommy,"Stop that man!  Stop him!!!  Tommy races through the horrified crowd.  The Stranger keeps moving, never once looking back.  Suddenly SIRENS.  Squad cars converge.  Sheriff Holdt and a slew of OFFICERS surround Tommy.  Weapons trained."
holdt,"Throw down the gun!  Now!!!  Tommy drops the gun.  Puts his arms up in surrender.  The cops swarm in, taking him."
tommy,Stop that man!  He's the one!  ANGLE ON FERRIS WHEEL  Beth and Tim exit the ride and follow the crowd toward the flashing LIGHTS of the police cruisers.
tim,Who's gettin' busted?  Beth is stunned to see Tommy being searched spread-eagle over the sheriff's car.
beth,"Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy."
tim,Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
beth, Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
tim,But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
beth," We can light our own tree at home.  She brushes against Tim's crotch and saunters away.  Tim glances back at Tommy, then follows her like a hungry puppy."
kara,His what?!
loomis,"Wait!  This boy is being placed in my custody.  Tommy looks out, stunned."
holdt,"What are you trying to pull now, Loomis?"
loomis,Uncuff him!  This is a matter of life or death.
holdt,"You'd better as fuck have an explanation for this, Doctor.  Loomis begins to usher Tommy through the gaping crowd."
tommy,"Dr. Loomis, there's something you should know -- "
loomis,"I know enough already.  Just shut your mouth and take me to that baby.  They move swiftly through the gaping crowd.  ANGLE ON TREE  A growing murmur of concern spreads.  ""Where's Harry?""  The children are becoming impatient, and the impending STORM isn't doing much to calm anyone's nerves.  Harry's people are at a loss to explain their star's whereabouts.  ANGLE ON LOOMIS AND TOMMY  On the fringes of the crowd.  Walking away.  ""Oohs"" and ""ahhs"" as the tree suddenly comes to life with thousands of orange lights.  From the boughs of the tree, ropes are pulled.  Bunting tears open, dropping hails of CANDY on the SHRIEKING kids.  Tommy glances back.  His eyes drawn to something.  Grotesque and misshapen.  In the tree."
tommy,"Oh my God --  ANGLE ON TREE  Kids of all ages scurry around the stage, laughing and screaming as a rainbow of candy RAINS down on them.  Diving for it.  Fighting over it. Scooping it up in big handfuls.  ANGLE ON TOMMY AND LOOMIS  Tommy instantly breaks away and tears back through the crowd."
loomis,"Tommy!  Loomis goes for him.  Sheriff Holdt sees what is happening and flies toward them in pursuit.  ANGLE ON TREE  A BALLERINA looks down at her white pillow case in horrified astonishment.  Her hands painted red as she reaches inside.  All of her candy is covered with blood!  The other kids back away in revulsion -- the entire stage begins to drip with blood!  The adults don't seem to notice what is happening, more concerned with the sudden burst of POURING RAIN.  Tommy pushes his way through the crowd, SCREAMING."
tommy,"Get them out of there!  Get out!!!  Sheriff Holdt tries to intercept Tommy just as he leaps up onto the stage, pushing kids out of the way.  Parents' faces register shock when they see their children running toward them, SCREAMING hysterically, soaked with blood.  Loomis sees what Tommy sees.  Words cannot convey the horror in his eyes.  Just then, a BOLT OF LIGHTNING ignites the tree.  SPARKS flash. Tiny pumpkin lights EXPLODE in a startling chain reaction.  Tommy helps the last of the kids off the stage when something falls from the gnarled branches:  a dangling, rotating, wrapped-up thing. The mutilated remains of Harry Simms!  Horrified, Tommy dashes headlong off the stage.  Runs with Loomis with the trampling crowd.  Struck dumb with terror, Holdt looks out upon the mass destruction. The bloody corpse hanging from the tree.  People running, SCREAMING, carrying their children toward the exits.  EXT. CAMPUS PARKING LOT   Bumper to bumper cars.  Horns BLARING.  Women SCREAMING.  Men SHOUTING. Children CRYING.  Pandemonium.  Loomis and Tommy appear out of this jumble of confusion.  More people running along the sidewalks."
tommy,"Oh, God -- Kara!!!  A car SCREECHES to a halt as Tommy barrels across the street.  Loomis right behind him.  Running toward home.  Once again, terror reigns in Haddonfield, Illinois."
danny,"Mommy, I'm scared."
kara,"There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep."
danny,I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
kara,No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
danny,Promise?
kara, I promise.
kara,"Beth, are you in there?  She knocks again.  No response.  Another CLAP OF THUNDER.  Kara shudders, quickly returns to Tommy's apartment and locks the door.  INT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER   Sounds of PASSION as we FOLLOW a trail of hastily-discarded costume pieces across the darkened foyer.  Tim and Beth are on the stairs, half-naked, kissing fervently."
beth, Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
tim, Guess so ...  Tim nuzzles his face in Beth's chest.  She's feeling apprehensive.
beth,What if your parents come home?
tim,"Then they can watch.  Laughing, they heard up the stairs, kissing, fondling each other. Slowly we PULL BACK into the foyer.  THUNDER and LIGHTNING CLASH, revealing the Shape, knife held at ready.  Watching.  INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT   She picks up the cordless phone, switches on and dials her home number.  We HEAR the phone RINGING on the other end.  INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT  Beth collapses with Tim onto Kara's bed.  The PHONE RINGS.  Tim ignores it, consumed by passion.  Beth sits up nervously."
beth,Aren't you gonna answer that?
tim,Answer what?
beth," What if it's Kara?  Frustrated, Tim jumps off the bed and stomps into the bathroom, taking a candle with him."
tim,"Fine.  You answer it.  I'll make friends with my soap on a rope.  Tim slams the door.  Beth deliberates her move, then goes to pick up the phone."
beth, Hello?  INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT  Kara is frantic.  Looking out the window at the Myers house.
kara, Mom -- Who is this?
kara,What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?  INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM 
beth,We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
beth,"He's in the bathroom.  BATHROOM - SHOWER   A lighted candle flickers.  Tim waits for the running shower to warm up as he does a bare-ass jig over to the sink.  Rinsing off his tooth brush, he elbows out a circle of steam from the mirror.  He gasps.  The Shape is standing right behind him!  Before he can react, Tim's head is yanked backwards.  The chilling SNAP of his neck is punctuated by a CRASH OF THUNDER.  INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT  Kara can SEE Beth on the phone.  Sitting by the window."
kara,"I'm across the street.  I can see you. Beth, I want you to listen to me.  Get Tim and get out of that house.  Right now.  Unnoticed by Kara, Danny rises and crosses the room.  Drawn toward the door by the irascible voice."
beth,"Kara, what the hell is going on?  INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT  Kara's mouth suddenly drops open.  Her mind snaps into sensory overload. She can see the Shape walking up behind Beth!  Raising a gleaming butcher knife!"
kara,"Beth, look out!  There's someone in the room!  He's right behind you!  INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM  Beth drops the phone, eyes bulging as the Shape plunges the knife into her back.  She falls, CRASHING against the vanity.  Beth SCREAMS unholy terror.  But the Shape isn't through.  INT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT  Kara stands frozen in pure horror, hearing and seeing her friend's vicious murder.  Her eyes shoot down.  A little blond-haired boy is walking steadily across the street toward the Myers house.  No, it can't be true.  Kara wheels around.  Danny is gone.  INT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW  Danny can be seen below walking toward the house as Beth's blood-gurgling SCREAMS fill the room.  The knife repeatedly, mercilessly SLASHING down at her.  EXT. STREET / MYERS HOUSE - NIGHT  Kara bolts out of the Blankenship house and races across the street, chasing after Danny through RAIN and LIGHTNING."
kara,"Danny, no!!!"
kara, Danny?
kara," Come on ... Danny, please."
kara,"Danny, run!!!"
kara,"Danny, come to Mommy.  Danny shakes his head.  Too frightened to move.  HALLWAY / FOYER  Ever so slowly, Kara moves toward the threshold.  Hefting the fireplace poker, she steps right over the Shape.  Instantly she snatches Danny up in her arms.  Takes one step forward when suddenly --"
danny,"Mommy!!!  The Shape springs up, twisting Kara's ankle.  She falls, splaying forward. The Shape claws at her leg.  Kara fights back, kicking herself free of the vice-like grip.  Scrambling to her feet, Kara rockets Danny through the foyer to the front door -- desperately trying to escape from this real-life house of horrors -- only to find that it is locked.  The Shape rises, gleaming butcher knife in hand.  Kara twists the deadbolt, but someone's secured the chain lock!  Too late to remove it.  The Shape is right behind them.  Only one way to go.  The cellar.  Kara shoves Danny through.  INT. CELLAR   Kara and Danny clatter down the rickety stairs and SPLASH across the flooded basement floor.  A soul-shuddering POUNDING on the door above.  Kara ushers Danny toward the elevated window.  The cellar door EXPLODES, the Shape's hand breaking through, splintering the wood as if it were paper.  Kara HEARS the Shape moving rapidly down the stairs.  Lifts Danny up the wall toward the window.  But it's not a wall -- it's John's electrocuted body, propped inside a storage cabinet!  Danny SHRIEKS, staring into John's lifeless eyes.  Kara pushes him up. Danny reaches for the lock.  Just an inch away.  Kara can't lift him any higher.  The Shape is coming!  Danny hoists himself up just enough to twist the lock.  He pushes the window open and clambers outside.  Kara scrambles up old pressboard shelves.  They break under her weight; she topples back to the floor.  The Shape wades toward her.  Reaching up for the window.  EXT. MYERS HOUSE - BASEMENT WINDOW  Danny watches his mother struggle to climb out of the crypt."
kara,"Danny, help me!  Kara's hand reaches toward him.  Danny makes no movement."
kara,"Danny!!!  INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR  Kara's foot falls on the handle of the knife jutting from her father's chest.  Uses it to springboard herself half-way through the window. Clawing at wet grass.  The Shape's hand shoots out of the darkness below, grabbing at her legs. Kara writhes, kicking and SCREAMING.  EXT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR WINDOW  Kara grabs chunks of mud as she is pulled back through the window.  The Shape yanks hard.  Kara catches herself on the window frame.  Quickly losing her grip.  INT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR  The knife swipes downward, swiping her ankle.  EXT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR WINDOW  Kara reacts to the searing pain, releasing her grip on the window frame. Suddenly Danny appears, locking onto her collar, pulling her clear in one massive heave.  Kara shuffles across the ground and picks herself up.  Grabs Danny's hand and runs full-tilt around the side of the house.  EXT. STREET / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE  CAMERA FOLLOWS their frenzied flight across the street.  Past Tommy's Explorer.  Kara limping.  Danny surging toward the Blankenship house.  Kara SCREAMS, pounding frantically on the door."
kara,Please!  Open the door!  INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - TOMMY'S APARTMENT  Tommy and Loomis have turned the apartment upside-down.
tommy,The baby -- where's the baby?!  Suddenly they HEAR Kara's frantic pleas outside.  Tommy bolts out the door. Loomis right behind him.  EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE   Kara POUNDS furiously.
kara,"Please!  Somebody help us!  Danny huddles beside her, peering out across the street.  DANNY'S P.O.V. - MYERS HOUSE  The Shape trudges boldly down the porch steps -- knife in hand!  BACK TO SCENE  Kara sees the Shape -- walking slowly and deliberately toward them.  Her SCREAMS become even more intense."
kara,"Help us please!!!  The Shape closes in.  At the last second, Tommy throws open the door.  Kara and Danny tumble inside.  Into his arms.  INT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - LOBBY / PARLOR   Loomis slams and deadbolts the door."
loomis,Get them upstairs.  Now!  Kara pounds against Tommy's chest.  Hysterical.
kara,Where's the baby?!
tommy,"He's gone.  Kara holds Danny close to her side, backing away in horror as Tommy and Loomis go around the parlor, securing the doors and windows.  THUNDER RIPS through the darkened room."
tommy, Who else knew I had the baby?!
loomis,No one.
tommy,No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
loomis,"Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.  Suddenly the window behind Kara EXPLODES.  She SCREAMS, recoiling.  Then the window in front of her.  HANDS reach through.  Tommy shoves her out of the way.  ANOTHER HAND shoots through the stained glass window in the front door, twists open the lock.  Danny races across the lobby and up the stairs.  Robed figures fill the doorways.  Climbing through windows.  Moving inside the house.  Surrounding Loomis."
loomis," Wynn!!!  The robed figures descend on Loomis.  Drops his .357.  Tommy lurches for it, to no avail.  Loomis's SCREAM fills the darkness like a fever dream."
loomis," Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!"
tommy,No!!!
danny,Mommy!  Please help me!  Kara rushes through darkness to find him.
kara,"Danny!  Danny, where are you?!"
tommy,"Kara, no!  Kara trips and falls.  A pair of silver-tipped black boots planted in bold stance.  Slowly she looks up the long duster, the cigarette in the gloved hand of the nefarious Stranger -- Dr. Wynn!  Danny stands by his side, staring dispassionately."
kara,"Danny, no ... please ..."
kara,"Mrs. Blankenship -- Oh, God -- Hurry. We have to --"
dawn,"Good evening, Dr. Wynn.  Your -- appointment is waiting inside.  Wynn picks up his messages, then heads straight into the office.  Dawn resumes her typing.  Something eerie in her grin.  INT. WYNN'S OFFICE - NIGHT   Wynn and his staff file inside.  Removing his hat and duster, he walks over to where Loomis is seated -- shackled to a chair, a bloody slash across his forehead.  Seeing this, Wynn snaps angrily at two burly GUARDS."
wynn,"What is this all about?  Remove those!  The guards comply.  Loomis rubs his aching wrists, glowering."
loomis,Where's the child?
wynn,"Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.  Loomis sees his .357 resting atop Wynn's desk -- only inches away.  Wynn's hand covers it, slips it inside the top drawer."
wynn," After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice."
loomis,"This is madness, Wynn."
wynn,"Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell."
loomis,It was you.
wynn, Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
loomis,Why did you take Jamie?
wynn,"She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny."
loomis,Jamie's baby ...
wynn,There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
loomis,Samhain.
wynn,"And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.  Loomis shudders, rocked by these revelations."
wynn,  Loomis is led across a narrow precipice overlooking a filthy prison cell. The Shape lies inside.  Dormant.  Wynn stares down hypnotically at his most prized possession.  Michael Myers.
wynn,"Look at him.  So silent, yet so deadly. He moves when I tell him to.  Act on my impulses.  Feels what I feel.  Wynn demonstrates.  Loomis looks on, spellbound."
wynn," Michael -- Rise.  Below, the Shape slowly rises.  Wynn takes out his trusted switchblade."
wynn," Michael -- Pain.  Wynn cuts his hand.  The Shape grabs his own hand in agony.  Wynn smiles, sucking the bleeding gash."
wynn," Michael -- Kill.  Suddenly Wynn whirls around, throwing Dawn -- his faithful secretary -- inside the Shape's pit.  Wynn watches with hideous delight as her horrified SCREAMS trail away into blood-gurgling SILENCE.  Loomis closes his eyes in anguish."
loomis,You've created a monster.
wynn,"Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.  Wynn carries on without remorse.  Loomis is brutally shoved forward."
wynn," We're not the only ones, you know. There are many believers -- generous contributors to our church.  You'd be amazed to know how far it reaches.  INT. CATACOMBS - STORAGE BUNKER  A metal door BUZZES open.  Tommy makes his way furtively inside, pocketing the key card.  A storage room filled with sawdust and wooden crates.  Tommy pries one of them open.  Eyes widening in startled disbelief.  A small arsenal of automatic rifles and ammunition inside."
tommy,"Holy shit ...  Tommy lifts a rifle, awed by its devastating lines, then slams in a cartridge and bolts out the door.  Back into the tunnels.  INT. CEREMONIAL ROOM - NIGHT  A large, amber-hued chamber.  The CHANTING coven forms a circle around a primitive stone altar where Kara is tied down, wearing a white gown, her head adorned with a wreath of mistletoe.  A wooden symbol of Thorn, like an inverted crucifix, hangs in a place of reverence.  Behind the altar, the Shape stands in its cell.  Waiting.  Loomis is led inside.  Wynn glides through this macabre gathering, up to the altar.  Looming over the terrified Kara.  The CHANTING continues as Wynn dons a magnificent ceremonial robe.  At Wynn's gesture, there is SILENCE.  The worshippers offer an obedient response, removing their hoods, baring the mark of Thorn on their wrists.  We recognize many of the faces in the congregation.  Wynn's staff.  Dr. Bonham.  Mrs. Blankenship.  The cross-eyed attendant from the bus depot. People from all walks of life.  Faces glazed with sadistic rapture."
wynn," Behind, Disciples of Thorn!  The final sign!  The birth of the heretic child, delivered unto us on the eve of our great Feast of the Sun ... as I have foreseen it."
wynn,"Spirits and powers of the flame, attend and witness this ritual.  Bear our gifts to Thorn.  Open us to the path of Darkness.  By these runes transform us. Open our eyes and show us the Chosen One to whom we offer this sacrifice of Innocent Blood.  Suddenly Danny is issued forth up to the altar.  His eyes dark, lifeless pools.  Kara struggles against her bonds."
kara,Danny!!!
wynn,"Strong and fierce Thorn, Thundered, by thy hammer we summon thee and offer this sacrifice of innocent blood.  Let thy Darkness descend on your son. Danny.  Lord of the Dead.  Danny drifts into the dark spell, holding the dagger above the SCREAMING infant.  Wynn speaks in the ominous WHISPERING VOICE:"
wynn," Kill for him, Danny ... Kill for him.  Kara cries, appealing to the boy inside of Michael."
kara,"Michael, please.  You can make him stop.  You remember, don't you?  The Shape stares hard at her through the sockets of its mask.  Listening. Reminded of his mother."
kara," Remember what he did to you that night. What his voice told you to do.  You can stop it, Michael.  Stop the voice forever.  Danny's eyes flash like fire.  The CHANTING is insidious."
wynn,"Kill him, Danny.  Kill him!"
kara,"Danny, don't listen!  The voice isn't real!  Danny turns sharply, seeing his mother.  Suddenly terrified."
wynn,"Kill him, Danny!  You feel the rage inside!  You are Thorn!  Suddenly Danny drops the dagger.  Wynn flies at him, SCREAMING like an enraged beast.  The Shape raises its dagger and plunges it -- into Wynn!  Wynn's eyes go wide with shock.  The Shape lurches empathetically.  Wynn staggers, yanks the blade from his stomach.  RAPID-FIRE GUNSHOTS rip through the chamber as Tommy lets loose a barrage of bullets from above.  Taking out several coven members, the rest scattering, retreating into the tunnels.  Loomis dives Danny a split second before he through Kara's bonds with the dagger.  Kara springs toward the baby as the room is ripped apart by GUNFIRE.  The altar decimated.  Candles falling.  Setting the room ablaze.  Wynn releases the supports which suspend the catwalk.  Wooden girders CRASH down from the ceiling.  Tommy pitches to the floor, dropping the rifle.  The Shape staggers, trying to get to its feet.  Slowly.  Painfully.  Flames lapping at its back.  Loomis crawls toward the rifle.  Grabs it.  Rises just as Wynn seizes Danny, a dagger at his throat.  Pulling him away."
loomis,No!!!
wynn,"Stay away, Sam."
loomis,Leave the boy.  Take me.  Loomis slowly places the rifle down in front of Wynn.  Surrendering himself.  Tommy drags himself toward Kara and the baby.  Paralyzed with horror as they try to anticipate Wynn's move.
wynn," Good-bye, Dr. Loomis.  Loomis turns.  Gasps in startled reflex.  The Shape rises up behind him, swiping the dagger across his chest!  Wynn retreats and flies through a doorway with Danny."
danny,Mommy!!!
kara,Danny!!!
loomis,"Die, Michael.  In the name of God, die!"
tommy,"This way!  Tommy leads her toward an exit sign.  Behind them, the elevator doors close. The indicator light shows it moving down.  They reach a dead end.  The row of coded security cages."
kara,What now?!
tommy," Wait a minute ...  He reaches into his pocket -- withdrawing Wynn's key card!  Suddenly the elevator doors open.  FIRE GUSTS.  The Shape emerges, totally engulfed in flame.  The emergency sprinklers are activated.  Dousing the flames as it walks after them.  Tommy panics, runs the key card.  The gate BUZZES open.  They run through. The Shape's hands lurch through the bars, missing Kara by inches.  They race toward the next gate.  The gate behind them opens, and the Shape walks through!  Tommy runs the card again.  The gate BUZZES.  They slam it -- one step ahead of the Shape.  The third and final gate.  Tommy tries the card.  Nothing!"
kara,Come on!
tommy, It's not working!  The Shape moves through the last gate.  Inside the cage with them!
tommy,  Kara lifts the baby inside.  Tommy flops down in the driver's seat.  Face bruised and bloody.  A key in the ignition.  Kara holds Jamie's baby.  Tears falling.
kara,"How will we ever find him?  Tommy's gaze terrifies her.  He starts the engine and tears off toward the sanitarium gate.  Kara looks down at the baby, then stares numbly forward.  In the back of the van, we can SEE the the Shape's white mask.  Glowing in the darkness.  Emerging.  Kara and Tommy drive on, unaware.  And that, for now, is how we leave them."
