lucas,"Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships."
walter,You going to take me on a nature walk?
lucas,"Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?"
walter,I fell asleep.
89.,CONTINUED: 
lucas,You walked home.
walter,Yes.
lucas,Some of these guys... They walk right into a family's home as if they live there. Very fucking ballsy.
walter,Fairy tales?
lucas,Do you believe in them?
90.,CONTINUED: 
walter,No.
lucas,Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
walter,Woodsman?
lucas,The one with the ax?
walter,I don't know.
lucas,"Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive."
walter,Little Red Riding Hood.
lucas,That's it. Little Red Riding Hood jumps out of the wolf's guts with hardly a scratch.  Ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half?
91.,CONTINUED: 
walter,You knew her?
lucas,What?
walter,The girl.
lucas, I don't know why they keep letting scum like you return to the streets. It just means we've got to catch you all over again.
walter,You have no right to talk to... to speak like... I am not!... I am not!
irl,"Wallie, what are you doing?"
92.,CONTINUED: 
vicki," Come on, let's get out of here."
pedro,Don't tell me you feel sorry for this sick fuck.
vicki,"Mind your own business, Pedro!"
93.,CONTINUED:
bob,What the hell is going on here?!
vicki,Have you seen Walter?
bob,What the hell is going on? V
vicki,"If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her."
vicki,Shit.
vicki,Thanks again. I promised I'd take care of his plants.
96.,CONTINUED:
97.,"CONTINUED: Children abound, playing, running free, getting off of school buses, running to meet their parents. There is no sign of Walter."
girl,See anything interesting?
walter,Not yet.
girl,It's my bird book.
walter,Where are your friends?
girl,I have friends.
98.,CONTINUED:
walter,A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
girl,I'm not pretty.
walter,Well... not in the common way.
girl,What does that mean?
walter,It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.
girl, Robin.
robin,"Yeah, like the bird."
99.,CONTINUED: 
walter, Can I ask how old you are?
robin,I'm twelve.
walter,No you're not.
robin,I will be in three months.  I can't wait. I hate being eleven. It has to be the stupidest age in the world.
walter,Walter.
robin,Do you have many friends?
walter,No.
robin,How come?
walter,"A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone."
robin,It sounds like you were banished.
walter,Banished... yeah.
100.,CONTINUED: 
robin,"Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them."
walter,Robin?
robin,Yes?
walter,Would you like to sit on my lap?
robin,What?
walter,Would you like to sit on my lap?
robin, No thank you.
walter,Are you sure?
robin,I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
walter,That's okay... doesn't matter.
robin, Do you want me to sit on your lap?
walter,Yes. I would enjoy that.
101.,CONTINUED: 
robin, They sound like finches.
walter,They could be finches. I don't know. We should go before it gets dark.
robin,My daddy lets me sit on his lap.
walter,Does he?
robin,Yes.
102.,CONTINUED: 
walter,Do you like it when he asks you?
robin,No.
walter,Why not?
103.,CONTINUED: 
robin,Ms. Kramer.
walter,Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
robin,I can't.
walter,"Yes you can, Robin."
robin,What will happen if I do?
walter,Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.
104.,CONTINUED: 
robin,But will he... ?
walter,Your daddy will always love you.
robin,How do you know?
walter,I know because... it's just something I know.
robin,I don't want to hurt my daddy.
walter,"Robin, listen to me."
robin,Walter?
walter,Yes?
robin,Do you still want me to sit on your lap?
105.,CONTINUED: 
walter,No.
robin,I don't mind.
walter,You should go home.
robin,Can't I stay a little longer?
walter,It's getting dark. Go home.
robin,Will I see you again?
walter,"Go home, Robin."
robin,Bye.
106.,CONTINUED:
walter,Hey!
walter,It's open.
lucas,"Hi ya, Walter."
walter,"What can I do for you, Sergeant Lucas?"
lucas,You don't know?
walter,Know what?
lucas,"I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?"
walter,No.
110.,CONTINUED:
lucas,man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
walter,I was asleep.
lucas, I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
walter,You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
lucas,The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
walter,I went to bed around seven.
lucas,I could take you downtown.
walter,"You could. It'd be a waste of your time, though."
lucas,There was a boy there.
111.,CONTINUED: 
walter,"I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill."
lucas,"Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head."
walter,I have a passionate girlfriend.
lucas,What's with the boxes?
walter,You're a cop. Figure it out.
lucas,I'd say you're moving.
walter,"It's a free country, isn't it?"
112.,CONTINUED: 
lucas,The passionate one?
walter,Yes.
lucas,Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
walter,I count my blessings.
lucas,"Well, I guess I'll be seeing you."
walter,Think you'll catch this guy?
lucas,"Oh, yeah. We'll catch him. Unfortunately, the victim can't talk. In addition to his other injuries, his jaw is broken."
walter,`Fraid not.
113.,CONTINUED: 
lucas,"Stay out of trouble, Walter. Cause I'll be watching you."
vicki,You okay?
walter,Yeah.
vicki,Fucking liar.
walter,I heard they were filthy birds.
vicki,Not when they fly.
114.,CONTINUED:
walter,It was hard.
115.,WALTER CONTINUED: I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to...
rosen,Accept you?
walter, Time.
rosen,How do you feel about that?
walter,I feel... okay.
