Speaker,Dialogue
doyle,Amanda McCready was taken from her home sometime between eight and eight thirty.
patrick,Did you know her?
angie,Vaguely.
patrick,Not if you're channel nine.
angie,"That's Timmy Reilly. Is he a cop now? A press conference with JACK DOYLE  comes on. Beneath his image is written ""JACK DOYLE, CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN."""
patrick,They can't be taking that many avenues. The whole force is outside the house.
bobby, Hey. How are you?
patrick,"Good, Bobby. Nice to see you."
angie,This is why it's embarrassing to do surveillance three blocks from where we live.
patrick,There they go.
angie,Go with him. I'll follow the mother.
patrick,Get out of the way.
kid,Fuck your mother.
patrick,Move the Huffy before I slap your face.
kid,"Missed me, faggot."
patrick,Fuck. Fuck. The car moves. The Lincoln is long gone. He pulls the car over. He sees an ITALIAN MAN IN HIS SIXTIES looking at him from the sidewalk . The man sits in front of a VFW. They trade looks.
patrick,"I want to report a drunk driver. I saw him consuming alcohol in his front seat, and he almost swiped an old lady."
patrick, 1989 Green Lincoln Mercury LS. Massachusetts Patriots bonus edition
patrick,Thank you. God bless. Patrick reaches into the glove compartment and produces a small device. He turns it on and sets it on the dash. By the SCRATCHY VOICES and STACCATO CODE we realize it's a POLICE
angie,Nguyen' s n a i l s a l o n .
patrick,T h a t ' s where s h e went?
angie,Yup. I ' m g e t t i n g my n a i l s d o n e . You s t i l l with t h e father?
patrick,I l o s t him.
angie,You d i d ?

patrick,"Whoops, t h e r e h e i s ."
tommy,Yah. Where'd my father leave the bag?
maureen,By the chair.
tommy,You know Cheryl Martin said Donna hired missing persons investigators to find me?
...,You're not missin'
tommy,Fuckin' bullshit. I can't go back to my own home to get my own clothes for fear of gettin' my wages garnished to support Mike Cuddehy' s fuckin' kids?
patrick,"""Dorchester' s best missing persons?"" That's terrible."
angie,What's wrong with it?
patrick,It's like having world's tallest midget as your slogan.
angie,It's better than the old one.
patrick,"You're just saying that cause the new one has your name on it. Patrick takes his gun out, wallet, puts them on the table."
angie,At a certain point the person who books half the business is entitled to her name on the door.
patrick,These people need to learn how to hide better. Staying at your girlfriend's in OC projects ain't slick.
angie,Keep telling yourself that.
patrick,"Yo, you want some cereal?"
patrick,I just wanted to see if you wanted some food .
angie,Did you know her?
patrick,Vaguely.
angie,This is horrible.
patrick,Not if you're Channel Nine.
doyle,We will pursue every avenue.
patrick,They can't be taking that many avenues. The whole force is outside the house. TV: A STILL PHOTO OF AMANDA MCCREADY  occupies a corner of the frame. She has dirty blonde hair and a shy smile.
newscaster,"Her mother says Amanda may be carrying Mirabelle, her favorite doll . . . On TV the camera goes to BEA and LIONEL.   Bea Speaks"
angie,Poor woman.
patrick,Look at these guys. Standing around posing for the camera like they have a purpose. That's why cops hate us. 
beatrice,My niece is missing.
patrick,I heard about that on the news . . .Excuse the mess. We just finished another case. . .
angie,"I am so sorry, Mrs. McCready. I can't imagine what this time must be like for your family."
patrick,"This is my associate, Angela Gennaro."
beatrice,We want to hire you to augment the police with the investigation.
lionel,Like Jean Benet Ramsey. The family hired investigators.
patrick,Right. I remember that.
beatrice,"The Police are nowhere, they're slow, they keep us in the dark. We want our own investigators."
angie,I'm not sure we're who you're looking for.
beatrice,Isn't that what you do? The ad in the paper said 'missing persons.' Tiniest of looks from Patrick to Angie.
patrick,"What Angie is trying to say is: we usually get hired to find people who like, take off to New Hampshire without payin' for their jet ski-- Bea looks up at Patrick, confused."
angie,Every Police officer in Boston is looking for your niece. This is something they're qualified for.
bea,What are you saying?
angie,I'm not sure how much help we can be.
patrick,"Hear her out, Ange."
bea,"You're not gonna do any harm, are you?  Why is this so hard? The cops sent one man until I called the Herald and raised Cain. The cops don't want me hirin' you. Now you don't want the job?"
patrick,It's not that we don't want the job.
bea,Don't you know people in the neighborhood? People who don't want to talk to Police?
patrick,Yes. We do. Have the Police told you anything so far?
bea,"If I hear they have ""no leads"" one more time I'm gonna lose my marbles. I mean, Helene was watching TV next door and wasn't gone for more than a half hour."
lionel,"She was watching ""Wife Swap"" downstairs."
patrick,Where's the father? Beatrice snorts. Lionel shoots her a look.
lionel,Germany. Army base. He doesn't want nothin' to do with Helene.
bea,Or Amanda. He doesn't think she's his.
patrick,Is there anyone you know? An acquaintance who could have taken her . . . a neighbor?
lionel,I don't know. You think she was definitely taken though?
patrick,If she were lost I think they . . .
bea,Couldn't she have fallen down a well or something? Like in Texas?
patrick,That's not what we hope for.. .
angie,How is Helene holding up?
lionel,She's trying.
bea,"Please, Lionel."
lionel,"Look, it. I had my problems, hard bust at 22. Bea straightened me out. Helene hasn't had that."
bea,"No, she has you. You find her work-- she was our housekeeper for a year and a half-"
patrick,We'll meet you over there. He throws Angie another small look.
bea,"We don't have a lot of money, but I saved over the years. Don't think we can't afford it. Angie gives her a smile."
angie,If a missing child isn't found in seventy two hours they are almost never recovered.
patrick,Pretty quick with the facts for someone who's so unqualified.
angie,I read that on the computer in two minutes while you were getting dressed.
patrick,"See that, you're already on the case."
angie,"We aren't needed, we canrt make a difference and we can't take their money."
patrick,I don't want to take their money.
angie,I don't want to find a child in a dumpster.
patrick,Neither do I. I want to find one alive who we can bring home.
angie,"We have a good life, Patrick."
patrick,This won't change that.
angie,"You go out in the rain, you get wet."
patrick,"If it's a four year-old girl out there, you go out and bring her back. We'll be okay."
day, EXT HELENE'S APT.   -
patrick,Block party.
officer reilly,Friends of the family?
lionel,It's okay. Come on in. Patrick heads down the hall toward the kitchen but turns back when he sees Angie going into the living room.
lionel,"Helene, this is Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro. The two women on the couch look over."
dottie,I remember you.
lionel,"Could you excuse us, Dottie?"
helene,"Dottie's my best friend, Lionel. She can be in my house if she wants."
patrick,We just want to ask a few questions.
helene,She can be here for that.
helene,I know.   I already talked to the cops forty times.
angie,We're sorry to take up your time.
patrick,Beatrice asked us to come here.
helene,- W h y don't Bea mind her business. It's  MY KID--
dottie,'Cause everyone's tryin' to get their moment now.
lionel,Bea hired these people to help find Amanda with her own money. You better show them the God damn courtesy they deserve !
dottie,"She's in grief, prick."
lionel,"She can grieve how she wants, Dottie. You don't live here."
helene,Don't yell at her. You ain't her father!
dottie,"Fuck you, Lionel. Lionel marches over toward Dottie. She scoots in a hurry."
lionel,I'm sorry.
angie,Maybe we should go.
lionel,I'm sorry . . . I understand.
patrick,"Can you excuse us, Helene?"
lionel,Helene has emotional problems.
beatrice,"It's not that, Lionel."
lionel,"What is it, then?"
beatrice,She's a cunt.
lionel,Beatrice! Don't say that word.
beatrice,"God help me, it's true."
lionel,"For God's sake, the walls are thin."
beatrice,"I don't care anymore, Lionel. Let her hear. Bea hands Patrick the photograph of Amanda."
angie,"  Well. We can't do any harm, right?"
lionel,"She drinks every day, she's got the gene. The disease. Our parents had it, too.  PATRICK She use drugs?"
lionel,I think she does a little coke.
patrick,"How much is a little?  LIONEL I don't know . . . few times a week, maybe. How much is a lot?  PATRICK Few times a week is a lot.  LIONEL Then she does a lot. I don't know anything about that.   I put the plug in the jug, myself. I got twenty three years sobriety. There is a short beat before:"
patrick,f o r lack of anything else) Good for you.
angie,What's Amanda like?
beatrice,"She's quiet. Has her manners, please and thank yous. She tries her hardest to be good."
angie,You mind if we look in her room?
patrick,We get a bonus for finding the furniture?
angie,Maybe she ran away.
patrick,Almost . He extends his hand.
doyle,Jack Doyle.
doyle,Nice to meet you.
angie,"Good to meet you, Captain"
doyle,I take it Bea hired you?
patrick,She wants to cover as much ground as she can. He looks them over.
angie,I take it you didn't want us hired.
doyle,These people aren' t rich.
patrick,We understand that. This is about helping in whatever way we can. Not about making money.
doyle,Good. I don't care who finds her. I just want it done.
angie,"We want that too, sir."
doyle,Fine. Keep us apprised.
patrick,Of course... is there any way we can see what you're looking at so far?
patrick,I'm not asking for the combination to the safe here . . .
big dave,I got nothin' to say. I already talked to the cops.
patrick,"Look, Dave, right?"
big dave,Big Dave.
patrick,"Okay, ""Big Dave."" ""Medium Patrick."" Nice to meet you."
big dave,You're a little light in the ass to be talkin' shit .
patrick,I apologize.
big dave,Buy a drink or screw.
angie,We'll have a couple of tonics.
steve,Steve . . . Tsafonias.
patrick,Zeus! How you been?
steve,"Oh, it's a real tragedy. She used to come in here, sit up on the bar and shit . . . She was like our mascot."
angie,Helene brought Amanda in here?
steve,"No, mostly in the afternoons. It's not the place for a child at night."
angie,Really?
steve, Hot tempers. Lotta drugs.
patrick,How much does Helene come in?
steve,Like five nights a week.  I seen her on the news saying how she was at her neighbor's for a half hour? Bullshit. She was in here snappin' lines for two hours.
patrick,Are you sure it was the same night?
steve,"Yeah, cause she was bumpin' rails in the shitter with Ray. I was knockin' on the door."
angie,Ray Li kanski?
steve,"He was duckin' me like a faggot 'cause he owes me a dime. Then he owes everyone money, I found out. Don't lend him no"
lenny,Don't talk about people you don't know.
steve,I know them.
patrick,"What's your problem, guy?"
lenny,"You said you ain't a cop, right? Why don' t you fuck off?"
patrick,Why don't you mind your business.
lenny,What are you doing here? thumbs at Big Dave) Dave can't make a martini.
patrick,We're trying to help Helene find her daughter.
big dave,Kids go missing all the time. They always show back up.
angie,Why don't you mind your business?
lenny,"Oh, shit, Dave. She told you."
big dave,She wants to come in here and be a smart ass?
patrick,Take it easy.
big dave,Don' t run your mouth like you're better than me.
patrick,"Just cool it, all right?"
lenny,"'Cool it"" Listen to this douche bag."
big dave,I bet she fucks this asshole in half. AN ALCOHOLIC calls out to Lenny.
alcoholic #1,Ask her if she sucks cock.
lenny,Ask her yourself. The door outside is ajar. LENNY'S PAL pushes it CLOSED.
patrick,What the fuck is wrong with you?
lenny,"You know, I wouldn't mind seein' some tit. Anyone else like tit?"
alcoholic # 3,I like tuna.
alcoholic # 2,Show me your tunaaaa!
angie,Shut the fuck up.
alcoholic #4, Twat steak!
angie,"Don't be stupid, Lenny."
alcoholic # 2,He's talking to his friends.
lenny,"Must be your good looks, Dave, bringin' in all the new snatch. There's some good lookin' pussy in here tonight."
big dave,"Lenny, think she wants to see your prick, first. Patrick reaches into his waistband and puts his hand on a SMALL HOLSTER, revealing a 9mrn Kahr handgun."
patrick,"No, Lenny. No one wants to see your prick.  B I G DAVE I do!"
lenny,Dave.
patrick,Back u p .

angie,"Patrick, letfs go. They move to the door.  EXT DORCHESTER AVE.- CONTINUOUS"
angie,"I'm fine. How's your hand.  PATRICK It fuckinf stings. He indicates his hand, there is some blood. He smiles. They are a little rattled.  ANGIE Thanks for that. He smiles.  PATRICK No problem."
angie,Helene was in there getting high--while her kid was at home for two hours. What kind of mother does that?
patrick,One who doesn't know better. A poor one. An abused one. A damaged one.
angie,A selfish one. They look out over the kids running past.
patrick,"Listen, you don't have to do this. I'm fine. If you want to bow out-"
angie,Have you ever known me to bow out on anything before?
patrick,No. But that was a scary thing.
angie,Why? Because of those men? You think they were gonna rape me? She smiles at him.
patrick,They weren't gonna do that.
a,gonna do that. . . She looks up
angie,"They' re not what I'm afraid of, Patrick."

bressant,Can I help you?
patrick,Detective Bressant?
bressant,That's right.
patrick,Patrick Kenzie. You just called me...
bressant,"Oh, sorry. Detective Sgt. Remy Bressant."
poole,Shit.  Detective Nick Raftopolous. Call me Poole .
patrick,This is Angie Gennaro.
angie,Is something wrong?
poole, No. No. I was just--
bressant,"We were expecting an . . . older couple, I guess."
angie,Life's full of surprises.
poole,This is the lead we're working: Corwin Earle.
bressant,"Serial molester, recently work-released. Went AWOL around the time Amanda disappeared."
poole,"Known associates: Leon Trett and his handsome wife Roberta. Apparently, The three of them have some kind of Addams Family thing goin' on."
',shoulders of a bank vault and a thin goatee.
patrick,Jesus.
poole,"The Trett's were released six, and eight months ago respectively. They have drug habits. We don't know where they are-but we think Corwin' s with 'em. Jailhouse snitch claims Corwin confided when he got out he was going to move in with his 'family . '"
bressant,He was gonna find him a kid he could keep in the house and have sex with.
patrick,Sounds promising.
bressant,Not for Amanda it doesn't.
patrick,That's not what I meant
angie,Is this who you think has Amanda?
poole,"  Well, they' re just suspects and there's some holes in the theory. Corwin likes boys. And he likes 'em seven to nine."
bressant,  Yeah. That's it. A convicted finger blaster who plans to keep a pre-teen at the foot of his bed and just cut off his  ANKLE BRACELET--
poole,"Take it easy, Remy--"
bressant,"--Who the fuck is this guy? You're here because Jack Doyle had us extend you a courtesy. You got something to contribute, be my guest. Otherwise go back to your Harry Potter book."
patrick,"I think you misunderstood my tone, sergeant detective. They gauge one another."
angie,Isn't it usually someone who knows the victim?
poole,I think Helene McCready has plenty of people in her life capable of this.
patrick,I'm sure you've interviewed Ray Likanski.
poole,Who?
patrick,Ray Likanski. Skinny Ray?   No?
bressant,Never heard of him.
patrick,"Well, with all due respect, we might be able to contribute on that point--"
poole,How' s that?
patrick,The night Amanda went missing Ray was doing coke at the Fillmore Lounge for two hours between eight and ten.
bressant,Fascinating.
patrick,With Helene McCready. Poole and Bressant are genuinely surprised by this.
poole,She did bullshit us...
angie,Why would she lie about that?
poole,'Cause it's fucking embarrassing. They go for their coats. Patrick takes the MUG SHOTS.
patrick,"I'll just grab a copy.. . As they stand, getting their things, Angie turns to Remy."
bressant,The kind they give you in Louisiana.
patrick,I thought you were from here.
bressant,"Depends on how you look at it. You might think you're more 'from heref than I am, for example-- but then again, I been living here longer than you been alive."
patrick,I'll have to mull that over. He takes the photos.

patrick,I know you don't pay your rent doin' peoplers taxes.
bubba,I don't do it sellin' penny rocks to wall- eyed child molesters neither.
patrick,"Just this one, Corwin Earle, is a molester. He might be staying with the other two baseheads. Just if you hear somethin' ."
bubba,What are you two? Crime dogs now?
patrick,We got hired to help find that little girl.
bubba,Oh yeah? Good for you. What happened?
angie,Turns out the mother was down the Fillmore all night when her kid was taken.
patrick,With Skinny Ray.
bubba,Fuck him.
patrick,I thought you were down with them.
bubba,With Ray? He works for the Haitian.
patrick,Ray works for Cheese?
bubba," Ray, Chris, Cheese, the whole trash picker crew.. ."
angie,You ever sell to Helene?
bubba,There's reasons why there aren't three inches of plexiglass between us right now- -two of them being I don't deal with coconuts like Cheese and skeezers like Helene.  Because I'm the one-eyed man in the kingdom of the fucking blind. Bubba SLAPS his hand over one eye. Angie smiles.   Patrick is on his way out.
helene,Who?
poole,"""Cheese"" Jean Baptiste."
helene,It sounds familiar . . .
bressant,"It don't ""sound familiar,"" Helene. He's a violent, sociopathic, Haitian criminal named ""Cheese."" Either you know him or you don't."
lionel,Who is he?
beatrice,"He's a drug lord or something, isn't he?"
lionel,Who is he?
helene,"He's just a guy, Lionel.. ."
bressant,Ask his homey here.
patrick, He ain't my homey.
bressant,"Hard to keep track with you people. Bea looks to Patrick, who shakes his head at Bressant."
poole,"He is, among other things, a drug dealer, Mrs. McCready."
lionel,What other things?
helene,I don' t know. . .
beatrice,"Why don't you answer your brother's questions, Helene?"
helene,"Why don't you go suck a nigger's dick, Bea? Lionel's FIST hits the table."
lionel,You listen to me. You don't insult my wife! And you don't make racial remarks in my kitchen. Who is this man?
poole,"He's a drug dealer, a pimp, a  PORNOGRAPHER--"
lionel,You associate with a pimp?
beatrice,"A pornographer, Helene . . .  POOLE And we think he rolled Pokey Jackson up in a carpet and shot him in the head on Castlegate.   So there's that, too. Bea canft fathom what shefs hearing."
bressant,What do you do for him?
helene,"I just mule.  Occasionally, and not making a habit out of it."
beatrice,"Jesus, Mary & Joseph. What is that, Lionel?"
lionel,"It means she's a drug runner. She carries drugs. Isn't that right, Helene?"
helene,A few times.
bressant,Where?
helene,Providence . . . Does it matter?
lionel,For what?
helene,"For fuckfs sake, Lionel. What do you think? Money. A taste . . ."
lionel,"Of what, drugs?"
helene,"Yeas, Lionel."
beatrice,What kind of drugs?
helene,"Yay, ron. . ."
beatrice,What does that mean?
poole,Cocaine and heroin.
beatrice,"No, we would have seen the tract marks--"
bressant,"Not if you snort it, right sugar?"
helene,Less addictive that way.
bressant,I don't know Helene. I keep thinking about this thing I heard. You know where I'm going with this?
helene,No.
bressant,Did you know I used to work DCU?
helene,I give a fuck.
bressant,"Right. So, I still know some of those guys real well. Anyway, I heard that someone ripped Cheese off on a New Hampshire run. You didn't hear that, did you? Angle on Patrick and Angie."
helene,No.
bressant,Care to take a polygraph?
bressant,Different questions this time.
poole,"How much you take, Helene? Nothing. Angle on Patrick."
bressant,You want Amanda back or not? Silence in the room.
poole,We know you took the money. How much did you take?
bressant,"rising, scary) How much? She takes a pull on her beer. Looks around. Fuck it."
helene,Ninety five. The room goes quiet.  LIONEL Hundred?
helene,rolls her eyes) Thousand.
beatrice,"Nintey five thousand dollars?!  HELENE Yeas, Bea!"
bressant,Howrd you do it. She exhales a long thread of smoke.
helene,"Two weeks ago me and Ray did a run up Nashua to drop four keys on some bikers. When we was walking back through the motel with the money, all these cops swooped in and went for the bikers. Amanda was with us so we pretended to be like a family and they went right past us. So we just-- got in the car and took off."
beatrice,You took Amanda with you?
helene,"What am I gonna do? Leave her in the car, Bea?"
beatrice, You are an abomination. God as my witness.
bressant,Hey.  Right here. What happened?
helene,"When we was driving back. Ray's like, 'everyone's gonna think the cops got the money too.'"
bressant,You told Cheese the cops got it?
patrick,But you and Ray kept the money?
helene,This whole fuckin' thing is Ray' s fault. Reactions to this realization.
poole,"Where's the money now, Helene?"
bressant,You want to find your daughter?
helene,Of course.
poole,Then you need to tell us. Where is it?
helene,With Ray.
bressant,And where's Ray?
helene,Chelsea.
beatrice,"Three days, Helene? You've known this? And she could be alive?  BRESSANT Let's go.   She rides with you. I don't want her in my car."
patrick,"Helene, you went to St. Mark's?"
helene,Yeah. Did you?
patrick,I was freshman when you were a senior. You were with Scott Flaherty?
helene,"Oh, him? He stabbed a foreign exchange student in the chest. Got life. He's a faggot now."
patrick,Seemed like he was already a faggot in high school.
helene,You're terrible.
patrick,How did the money end up with Ray in Chelsea? I thought you went home after.
helene,"We dropped off Amanda, went back to Ray's then fuckin' retarded Ray left his rock at my place-- right then I was like 'I'm dropping this motherfucker, I don't care if he does have a big dick' so we went back to the apartment, he was, hollerin' and gonna wake up Amanda, who needs her sleep, so we went back to Ray' s. Ray' s mother's, whatever. I don't know where the mother is but she left all her fuckin' cats and it smells like cock in"
patrick,Cheese never contacted you? They never left a note?
helene,No. We never heard nothin' from them. That' s why Ray said don' t say shit .
angie,"You didn't think it was worth it, for your daughter's sake, to tell people what happened?"
helene,What am I gonna do? Call Cheese and be like-- do you have my daughter? 'Cause I ripped you off and I'm just checkin'?
patrick,The cops never asked you about Cheese before?
helene,No.
patrick,What if Ray already spent the money?
helene,"Nigga, please. I hid it."
poole,Looks like he held out pretty long.  PATRICK He didn' t have it.  POOLE Huh?  PATRICK He couldn't tell them where it was 'cause he didn't know. Helene hid it.
bressant,Ray made poor relationship choices.
patrick, Guess they didn't believe him.
poole,Poor prick.
patrick,It's okay . . .
helene,I just want my daughter home with me.
patrick,Did Cheese know you were on the ride with Ray?
helene,I think so.
patrick,"Okay . . . Where's the money, Helene? Poole and Bressant emerge from the house."
helene,Right here.
patrick,Where?
helene,I buried it when Ray was passed out.
poole,What was that book about 'everything you need is in your own backyard?' It's a French book.
bressant,That wasn't a book. It was a cartoon Helene knows.
helene,Fuck you.
angie,"So, you bring in the FBI at this point?"
bressant,That's the worst thing we could do.
angie,Why is that?
bressant,'Cause I don't want Cheese to open a bag full of newspaper and kill Amanda.
angie,It ' s kidnapping.
bressant,I don't see a note.  You see a note?
poole,Nope.
bressant,We're investigating a missing children's case. Has nothing to do with kidnapping. He turns to Patrick and Angie.
poole,So everyone keep their mouths shut.
helene, Do you know Cheese?
patrick,When we were ten. He hardly spoke English. His brother Jude was a sweet kid.
helene,"He wouldn't hurt her, right?"
helene,No.
angie,"He moved here when I did. There was a lot of tension between black American kids and Haitians-and he got it the worst.He had no running water at home. This one girl was on him real hard 'cause he smelled bad, calling him 'cheese.' All of a sudden, he breaks a bottle, holds her down, and carves the word Cheese in her face. She lost an eye. Someone found it on the sidewalk the next day."
patrick,And the name stuck.
angie,But I'm sure Amanda will be fine.
bressant,"Just keep your mouth shut, okay? We can get her back. It'll be fine. I have no fear of this idiot."
bressant,"That's the next step, yeah."
helene,Tell him I'm sorry. Tell him I apologize.
poole,Sorry goes a long way.
helene," She's a handful, that one. At least I know she's giving them hell. They react to this woman's feeble grip on reality."
patrick,What about Ray?
bressant,You know what percentage of murders were solved last year in Boston? Twenty nine. Less in Chelsea.
poole,Take her home. We'll handle Chelsea. They move to go.
helene,I'm hungry.
patrick,We' 11 get you some food.

bressant,Where do you think you're going?
patrick,To talk to Cheese.
poole,No you're not.
bressant,Get back in your car.
patrick,That's a mistake. He'll never talk to a badge. I know him. If there's a deal to be brokered we're the ones who can do it.
bressant,No. Me and Nick are handling this. This is too important.
patrick,"If you two go in, negotiate a ransom for a girl, then it is kidnapping and that's the FBI."
angie,All you're gonna do is scare him and the more scared he is the worse it is for her.
patrick,Do you want to get the kid back or not?
bressant,"I'm gonna take that as a rhetorical question.  PATRICK Sit fuckin' tight. We know him, he111 talk to us and we'll be right back.  CUT TO:"
cheese,Been a long time.
girl,You know I' 11 be right here.
cheese,Bitches love the cheddar.
patrick,"How you been, Chris?"
chris mullen,Better than you.
patrick,Good to hear it.
patrick,We found what you were lookin' for in Chelsea.
cheese,What makes you think I am concerned with the doings in Chelsea?
patrick,Cause I know one of the idiots who robbed you lives there.
cheese,What idiot?
patrick,The one you just killed.
cheese,"I don't know about nobody gettin' killed. If someone robbed me and end up dead, you know, life a ma' fucker."
angie,"Cheese, I appreciate you're seeing us. I know you're busy so we' 11 be quick."
cheese,What you talkin' about?   What girl?
patrick,"Cheese, look at me. No one gives    a fuck what you did. I never even liked    Ray. You get the money. The girl goes    home to her mother we'll say we found her   in the bushes or whatever."
cheese,I donft know.
patrick,"No. Don' t do this, bro. This isn' t the time for that. This is where you take the offer. It's either this real quiet or it's ten thousand fuckin' cops kickin' the door down and arresting everybody."
cheese,"First of all, don't never come up in my spot like that. You got my money? You can leave that shit in the mailbox on you ass way out. Feel me? Some other motherfuckers let fools rob on 'em. I don't play scrimmage-- but I don't fuck with no kids-- Something occurs to Cheese."
patrick,"If you point a gun at her again I'm gonna pull your fuckin' card, okay?"
cheese,Don't never speak to me that way.
poole,What happened?
angie,He said he didn't know anything but if we had his money we could leave it in the mailbox.
bressant,Is that what he told you?
patrick,"Yeah, that's it."
poole,He said nothing else?
patrick,He wants you off his fuckin' lawn.
poole,I thought you knew the guy.
bressant,Half the guys he grew up with are degenerates.
patrick,You know what the other half are?
bressant,What?
patrick,Cops. But don't hold it against me.
bressant,"Nah. You know what I hold against you? We had one chance to make this deal. You said you knew him, you said you could do it and you fucked it up. Now we have to get a warrant for a tap, start surveillance and hope to Christ we get lucky. If that costs Amanda her life, I won't have to hold it against you. You'll hold it against yourself for a good, long time."
angie,"Look, the Police taking over isn't necessarily a bad thing."
patrick,No?
angie,They see more child exploitation in a week than we could in a career...
patrick,Makes you want to have kids.
angie,Does it make you not want to?
patrick,"There's a political party in Holland that openly advocates pedophelia and won seats in parliament. In America four hundred thousand kids get abused every year. There are half a million convicted, registered sex offenders, two-thirds of them for molesting children under fourteen, there are a hundred thousand child porn web sites. They busted one in texas had seventy thousand members-- people who gave their credit cards . . . There's a group, the 'Rene Guyon' society, whose motto is 'sex before eight or it's too late.' There's a rise in the victimization of 'pre-verbal' children, for the obvious reason that they can't report their accusers. One in five American girls is sexually abused or victimized before they turn eighteen. But only one third of those every tells anyone in their lifetime that they were abused. She gives him a look: 'oh, really?'"
angie,And that tells you you don't want children.
patrick,It tells me there aren't enough gas chambers.
angie,Yeah?
patrick,I'm just not sure a kid would love to be here.
angie,Yeah?
bressant,Guess you did something right.
angie,What ?
bressant,Cheese came around. Called in and said he wants to make a drop. Said he left something in your mailbox.
angie,Really?
bressant,"Well, you're gonna have to check the mailbox yourself, but yeah."
angie,Great.
bressant,It is and it isn't. They tape calls coming into the station now.
angie,What does that mean?
bressant,"It means Jack heard about it, he wants you down here and he's fuckin' pissed."
patrick,What are you doing here?
devin,"When the boss wants you met, he only sends the best."
angie,Or when he wants you brought up the back way.
devin,That's what he said?
doyle,"The ""lake"" he refers to is the water in the abandoned quarry. He refers to the transcript."
angie,"Captain, we were concerned for the safety"
doyle,"I understand what your concern was. My concern, interestingly, is also for the well being of that child. And now that concern has been elevated because of the risky and ill-advised course of action you people have taken."
bressant,"You don't have to be party to it, sir . . ."
doyle,"The hell I don't. If I delay this now, after this agreement, it would only further endanger the life of this girl. Does that sound like something you expect me to do?"
patrick,I'll accept responsibility for--
doyle,You' 11 accept-- Don' t come in here and get noble with me. Responsibility is earned. You can't take something you have no shoulder for.
bressant,They want to separate us. He points to diverging paths on the map.
doyle,This man won't come alone. Who is he likely to bring?
patrick,Chris Mullen was in the apartment when we made the offer.
doyle,What do you know about him?
patrick,"Well, it was probably him that killed Ray for Cheese. If I had to guess."
poole,He didn't ask you what you guessed.    He asked you what do you know.
patrick,"I know he's a six foot, thirty year old, caucasian heroin addict. And I know it was him, not Cheese, who rolled up Pokey Jackson and shot him in the head."
bressant,"I think we're all set here, Captain."
doyle,"No one else knows about this, correct?"
angie,I just wonder.. .
doyle, Yes?
angie,"Are we rationalizing this? I mean, wouldn't a hundred police up there be better for her than the four of us? Doyle stops."
doyle,What does that mean?
angie,"I'm asking if keeping this quiet is better for Amanda, or is it better for us?"
doyle,"Do you have any children, Miss Gennaro?"
doyle,"I honor my daughter with this, this division, so no parent has to live what I've known . . .Not even a woman like Helene McCready .   is all I care about. And we're going to bring her home."
sun just set, EXT. QUARRY PARKING LOT   -
angie,Why is he bringing us all the way up here?
patrick,"Dark, big, make sure he can get away."
angie,No. Something's wrong.
patrick,All he wants is the money. He just doesn't want to get arrested doing it.
angie,They're gonna kill her. I can feel it. He looks out the window.
poole,This asshole could have picked somewhere on level ground.
bressant,Keep the lights off for now.
angie,Is this where all the peak rocks have names?
patrick,(listing the names of the

poole,Where'd they get those fuckin' names?
patrick,From the kids who died tryin' to jump off em..
poole,Be careful.
angie,You be careful.

angie,Where did she fall!?
poole,"We heard it, too."
bressant,First thing I saw was something went in.
angie,Where is she?!
patrick,What happened?
bressant,"We got one, the other took off. Patrick and Angie scour the water with their flashlights."
patrick,"Right there! SOMETHING IN THE WATER. A flash of something flesh-colored. The minute she sees it, Angie SAILS OUT OVER THE CLIFF AND"
poole,Jesus.
patrick,Is your leg alright?
angie,It will be. You hear anything?
patrick,"Cops found no one up there. Shocker. I guess as soon as they had the money, someone shot Cheese and another guy came out shootin'. They must have tossed her in."
angie,Why?
patrick,I don't know. She saw their faces.      For some people that's enough.
angie,But you and me could recognize Chris.
patrick,Remy said the other two kids were black. So it wasn't Chris.
angie,Have they found her?
patrick,"No, but they got divers up there now, so.. ."
angie,Then she could be alive. She could be hiding. She could be stuck . . .
patrick,"Yeah but, the one cop told me that two years ago some guy killed his wife and dumped her in there-- the divers found the body . . .but it was so dark they lost it and then they could never find it again. There's so many crags and outcroppings and old cars and shit."
angie,I'm sorry. . . I'm sorry. .

teamster,"Do you know who's bar this is, shit-head?"
popeye,Or you can get wise. It's up to you. The bartender places a STACK OF BILLS on the bar -- 2 or 3 grand. Popeye throws a DUFFLE BAG at him and he fills it.
dart player,We got families.
popeye,Pipe down.
lionel,You don't have to do this
lionel, Wait. Jesus.
patrick,Amanda McCready was taken by Remy Bressant !
bressant,Don't say that fucking name!
lionel,I already told him we did it for ransom. I told him we did it for ransom! Remy . . . Please. Ill.
bressant,"Fuck. . . His heart isn't in it. He begins to lower his gun  BANG! BANG! TWO SHOTS HIT Bressant. He takes a beat to register this, standing stock-still. The Bartender is standing there with a smoking gun, in shock. Patrick leaps out of his chair and drives his head into Bressant's stomach. Wrapping his arms around his waist, he plows his spine straight back into the bar."
secretary,Call 911! Call 911!
patrick,Put the fuckin' gun down!            Put it down.
bressant,That bartender wasn't fuckin' around.
patrick,Fuck you. You let this little girl die. You want to tell me how to live?
bressant,I know.
patrick,You know? You let a girl go off a cliff. What do you know? You don't know.
patrick,She was a child--
bressant,Yeah.
patrick,Why would I expose a conspiracy I was a part of?
captain,A Police officer was killed today. That's not looked on lightly.
patrick,Is corruption looked on lightly?
beefy officer,You got a smart mouth.
patrick,How is getting a little girl killed looked on?
captain,We'd like to ensure that you're telling us the truth. Is that all right with you? Hot shit?
patrick,"It's fine, hot shit."
captain,"So, after setting up Jean Baptiste, your friend Chris Mullen was coincidentally killed? And you didn't have nothing to do with it?"
patrick,He was probably killed by Sgt. Detective Remy Bressant or anyone else who wanted the 130K in his backpack.
beefy officer,You charge money as a detective. But you were at the quarry and yet you had no idea it was a set up?
patrick,"I trust the Police when they tell me something. And I had a fake ransom note and Amanda's blanket the cops left in my mailbox. And I heard the tape from when Cheese, or I guess it was Chris pretending to be Cheese, called the station."
captain,A 911 call?
patrick,No. The call into the station from Cheese to Remy.
captain,We don't tape calls into the station.
beefy officer,Did you hear a tape?
patrick,No.
beefy officer,Did you see a transcript?
patrick,I must have remembered it wrong. Remy read it to me.
captain,Calm down.
angie,What happened?
patrick,They kept my shoelaces.
angie,We'll go down to Zayre's tomorrow and get you some new ones.
patrick,I don't want to do that tomorrow.
angie,What do you want to do?
patrick,Take a trip.
angie,You want to tell me where our trip has taken us?
patrick,You know where we are.
patrick,Are you sure?
angie,Yes.
patrick,"He was a part of it. They don't tape calls. He handed us a transcript like it was evidence and he knew it was a forgery- -maybe he forged it himself. He knew what they were doing, he supported it and he covered it up."
angie,Why? For a third of a hundred and thirty grand? What for?
patrick,Had to be for something.
angie,"When you're talking about ruining an old man who lost his child and gave years of service . . . ""something"" isn't enough."
patrick,"For a guy who tried to ruin us, something' s plenty."
angie,"This is the kind of thing where if you do it, you want to be sure."
patrick,No.
angie,No.
amanda,"Don't forget mine, gramma."
francine,"I'd never forget yours, sweetheart. Doyle lifts Amanda off the porch and carries her to the Suburban. He dips down, allowing Amanda to place her back- pack inside."
amanda,"Can I have a, please a sandwich?"
doyle,What kind do you want.
amanda,Grill Cheese.
doyle,"You like the crusts on, right?"
amanda, Noooo! I don't like the crusts on!
patrick,Jesus.
angie,She's alive.
angie,She's happy.
patrick,No.. .
angie,She' s happy here.
patrick,"Angie, don't do this."
angie,If you call the Police they'll send her back.
patrick,I need you on my side.
angie,I am on your side but I can't send her back.
patrick,We're not sending her anywhere. That's her mother. She has a right to her child.
angie,He's better for her.
patrick,Why? Because he has money and makes sandwiches?
simply),Because he loves her.
patrick,"Helene loves her, too."
angie,No.
patrick,She might learn from this.
angie,No.   People don't change.
patrick,You can't take away someone's kid.
angie,I don't want to.   I want to leave their child with them.
patrick,~ l this time we wanted to bring her
angie,Because I know right and wrong when I see it.
patrick,I need you to understand me right now. I need you to love me and say I know this is a hard decision but I stand by you. I need you to take me home and make this okay.
angie,I can do that. I can take you home and I know how to make it okay.
patrick,You can't ask me to do something I can't do.
angie,"You can't ask me to live with it,"
doyle,Patrick Kenzie. To what do I owe the pleasure?
patrick,Remy Bressant died last night.
doyle,I was told. It's a shame.
patrick,Hard to understand.    He seemed like a good man.
doyle,"He was a good man. You don't know why people do what they do. Only they see out their own windows. With that, AMANDA walks out the door, running to Jack and clinging to his leg. Jack holds Patrick's look."
amanda,Papapa.    Come make sandwiches now please.
patrick,Men killed for.
doyle,I'm giving that little girl a life.
patrick,"It's not your life to give. Helene is her mother. You think she's a bad mother you should have gone to social services. Short of that, it's her mother, it's where she belongs."
doyle,"Turn around, get back in your car and wait thirty years. You don't know what the world is made of yet."
patrick,I know I'm tired of being lied to   and tired of being lectured by a gang   of criminals. I'm calling the State    Police in five minutes. They'll be here    in ten.
doyle,No.
patrick,See you at the arraignment.
doyle,You can do one good pure thing here today. One right thing. Most men don't get that chance in a lifetime.
patrick,"Then I guess I will. I'll tell them I'm sorry and I'll live with it. And maybe that will happen, what I'm not gonna do, is have to apologize to a grown woman who says, why did you leave me? I got kidnapped, my aunt hired you to find me, and you did. You found me with a strange family but you broke your promise and you left me there. Why? Why didn't you bring me home?"
i still,Then you'll have to excuse me. have a sandwich left to make.
angie,Sorryr I had to come back and get some stuff.
patrick,It's okay. She looks at himl almost sympathetic.
angie,There's nothing to say
s,You think hef11 like me? Patrick looks over to Helene standing in the doorwayf all dolled up -- striking a pose. She wears too much makeup. Her clothes reveal too much of what she hasn't got.
patrick,Who?
helene,My date.
patrick,I'm sure he will.
helene,Aww' you' re sweet. He seen me on my American Victim and he wrote me letters and I was like whatever' but then he saw my Katie Couric and drove down here from Providence so I was likef that's romantic' right? Patrick forces a smile.
patrick,Howfs Bea?
helene,I wouldn't let her in the apartment.
patrick,Yeah.
helene,Don' t think she didnft hate you for Lionel goinr to jail.
patrick,Probably why she never paid my bill.
helene,You should fuckin' sue.
patrick,How about youf Helene? You hate me?
helene,Euck no. Brother or not he took my kid. Euck him. She could' a been hurt.
patrick,What about Amanda?
helene,What about Amanda?
patrick,Who's watching her?
helene,Dottie.
patrick,Dottie know that?
helene,"She will in five minutes.   Shit, I'm gonna be late, too."
patrick,Sure.
helene,For real?
patrick,It's fine.
helene,She likes you.
