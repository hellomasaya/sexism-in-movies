Speaker,Dialogue
barbara,Alex...
ken,My suitcase workin' out for ya?
alex,"Whoa! Whoa! Mom, you gotta leave that on. It's like... the tag made the last flight without crashin' or anything, right? So, it should stay on, or with, the bag for good luck."
barbara,Where would you get a nutball idea like that?
ken,I'm still here.
tod,"Yeah, we're all set Dad."
alex,I will. Don't worry.
tod,I didn't think anything could worse than my yearbook picture.
george,Now you know how I feel havin' to look at you all the time.
carter, What the fuck's he want?
clear,The airport doesn't endorse solicitors.
alex,"Fuh-ck, do we have to put up with that shit the whole time?"
hare krishana,Death is not the end.
hare krishana, Hare Rama.
ticket clerk,I have a few questions to ask you this afternoon.
ticket clerk,Have you recieved any packages from persons unknown to you?
ticket clerk,Same as your birthday.
billy,I can't believe they let that dickhead on this trip.
george,"His parents bought a ton of those trip certificates we had to sell, just to get him out of their hair for ten days."
tod,"Dude, I so worked the ticket clerk so you're sittin' next to Christa and I'm next to Blake."
tod,"Dude, if we don't get someone going on this flight, we should just call Dr. Kervorkian and put ourselves out of our fuckn' misery."
clear,Thanks.
alex,"Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay."
tod,"Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torgue a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake? You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?"
alex,John Denver...
alex,He died in a plane crash.
george,Good sign. Younger the better. It would be a fucked-up God to take down this plane.
george,A REALLY fucked-up God.
christa,"Could you trade seats with Blake so she and I can sit together? I asked Tod, but he says he's got some medical thing?"
tod, Fag.
alex,"C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?"
tod,"Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' ""Stepmom."""
christa,"Could you trade seats with Blake so she and I can sit together? I asked Tod, but he's got some medical thing."
tod,"Dude, what up?"
flight attendant,"Is there a a problem, sir?"
carter,What's your fuckin' problem?
alex,Qu'est-ce se?! THE PLANE'S GONNA EXPLODE!
alex,We have to get out!
carter,Sit! DOWN! Browning!
alex,I'm not joking! I'm not joking!
alex,Listen to me! This plane will explode on take-off!
flight attendant,"Sir, we will remove you from the aircraft if this continues."
carter,I'll remove him.
alex,Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
terry,He didn't do nothin'!
flight attendant, Anybody in the aisle is off the plane!
billy,"No, wait, I was late... that's my seat right there!"
billy,I didn't do anything! I have my ticket right here!
tod,It's alright. It's alright. You're off the plane. You're off the plane...
billy,I was in the bathroom. The lock was stuck. I didn't fight with anyone!
tod,I called your mom and dad and they're on their way.
alex,"I... I saw it... like, I don't know... the plane took off. I saw it leave the runway... I looked down and saw the ground..."
tod,"Been on many planes that blew up, have you?"
carter,We get thrown off the plane and blow a half day in Paris because Browning has a bad dream?  It's going to explode! It's going to explode!
tod,"Fuck off, Horton."
alex,Only trip you're gonna take is to the fuckin' hospital.
billy,There they go and here we stay.
carter,"You're payin' for my trip, Browning!"
alex,I wish you were on the plane!
alex,You're lookin' at me as if I caused it. I did not cause this.
alex,How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
clear,He's not a witch.
seigel,"Hello. I'm Howard Seigel, National Transportation Safety Board vice chairmen. We've notified your families and they are on their way. Does anyone feel they need medical attention or spiritual counseling at this time?"
seigel,The cause of the explosion is undetermined. Nassau county authorities are on the scene. Naval search and rescue are en route.
weine,"We understand how you must be feeling at this hour... and although we know it may be difficult, we must ask you some questions... regarding today's events, while it's still fresh in your minds."
weine,"It may be valuable to our rescue attempts, or any potential... criminal investigation."
schreck,You said...  How did you know that?
alex,I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
weine,"Did you take any seditives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?"
alex,No. I saw it. I saw it!
alex,Not like a dream... more than that. I experienced the plane exploding... it was so horrible... I know what they all went through tonight...
schreck,"Did this ""weird feeling"" have anything to do with you saying you wished Carter Horton was on the plane... just before it exploded?"
alex,No!
schreck,Why'd you say it?
alex,Because... I... never thought it would really happen.
weine,"If that's the case, Alex... why did you really get off the plane?"
tod,My brother... told me to keep an eye on Alex. He stayed... and I went to make sure Alex was okay.  He told me to get off the plane.
weine,"No one forced you to get off the plane. You told us you aren't friends with any that did... so, why did you leave the airplane?"
clear,Because I saw and I heard Alex. And... I believed him.
clear,Here's good.
clear,Thank you for the ride.
carter,"Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything."
alex,I don't.
carter, To live my life to the fullest.
alex,Then maybe you should lay off the J.D.
carter,Don't ever fucking again tell me what to do. I control me. Not you.
carter,I'm never gonna die.
billy,I took my driver's test this week at the DMV...
billy,"Got a 70. Lowest score, but I passed. When I was done with the test, the guy who drives with you during the test, he goes, ""Young man, you're going to die at a very young age.""  That true?"
alex,"Not here, not now.  Not EVER!"
billy,"If I ask out Cynthia Paster, will she say ""no?"""
alex,Ms. Lewton...
tod, Hey.
alex,"I don't want to sound gay, or nothin, but... I miss you."
tod,"Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks."
alex,That's a plan.
tod,"I gotta go. This thing Ms. Lewton showed me in her class, they're gonna let me read it. It says what I'm feeling."
clear,Because of you... I'm still alive. Thank you.
alex,What happened? Is Tod alright?
alex,What... what happened?
alex,Mr. Waggner...
alex,He wouldn't do it!
alex,He... he told me we would be friends again after you got better. After you got over George. Why would he make plans for the future if he were planning on killing himself?
alex,It's only the end of June.
clear, Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
clear,Know what this is?
alex,"Like, um... you're mad about something?"
clear,A piece of debris... from the plane. I went to the shore off the crash site and it washed up on the beach.
alex,"You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits."
clear,It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
alex,Why were you there last night?
clear,"Look, I've seen enough T.V. to know the F.B.I. doesn't investigate teen suicides. But they were there last night, that means: one, they still don't have a clue what caused the crash. Two, they haven't ruled out anything. And the fact that seven people got off the plane is probably weird enough, not to mention, that one of those people had a vision, or whatever, of it exploding minutes before it did explode, is highly suspicious. And it doesn't help that the visionaries' friend just committed suicide."
alex,Why were you there last night?
clear,Know what this is?
clear,It's you.
clear,"Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex."
alex,I'm... really sorry.
clear,"Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehansible attraction."
clear,"And you can still feel it, can't you? Something from that day is still with you. I know, because I can still feel you."
clear,That's why I was there last night.
alex,"I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere."
clear,"""It?"""
alex,What if Tod... is just the first... of us?  The idea sends a shot of apprehension through Clear.
clear,"Is that something you're ""feeling?"""
alex,"I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe... I would know."
clear,"Then, let's go see him!"
clear, Gives me a rush...
alex,This place?!
clear,Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
clear,"Good call. Very ""Quincy."""
alex,That... him?
clear,I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
alex,"That's him, but... he's not here. That... whatever... that whatever made him Tod is gone."
alex,Why..?
alex,"I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father..."
clear,"They said he hung himself, but there's no marks."
alex,What are all those tiny marks?
alex,Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
clear,Why would they say it was a suicide... if it weren't?
alex,His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
alex,You saying Tod did kill himself?
alex,Design?
alex,"Maybe there's no way to win... but... if you figured out the game... you knew where the ""steel ball was rolling"" couldn't you avoid the trap and extend the playing time? Couldn't you... cheat Death at Its own game?"
alex,I'm sorry we broke in.
clear,We didn't find what we were looking for.
alex,"Yeah, we did."
alex,He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns.
clear, As in flannels and plaids?
alex,How many died on Flight 180? From our group?
clear,Thirty-nine.
alex,Remember the gate number?
clear,No.
alex,Thirty-nine.
alex,Remember the departure time?
alex,Right. April 25th.
clear,"Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach."
alex,My birthday is the same as of the time I was meant to die! That's a reach!?
clear,"You're sounding like those people who, you know... ""Oswald shot Kennedy from a warehouse and hid in a theatre and Booth shot Lincoln in a theatre and hid in a warehouse."""
alex,"I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane."
clear,That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
clear,She's leaving the school. Moving away.
alex,"Clear, how do we know that by just sitting here, breathing this air or sipping the coffee, having crossed the street... we haven't started in motion the events that will lead to our death? Fifty years from now. Ten years. Tomorrow.  You don't unless... you're able to open yourself to the signs I'm willing to show you."
clear,"I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like         on the plane?"
alex,"No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design."
clear,"Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence."
alex,"The mortician said Death has a design. Now... if you, me, Tod, Carter, Terry, Billy, Ms. Lewton messed up that design, because, for whatever reason, I was able to see Death's plan... then we cheated it.  But what if it was our time, what if we were not meant to get off that plane? What if it is still is our time? If... It... is still not finished with us? We will all still die; now, not later."
clear,"After hearing you, just now... I do believe..."
alex,Then there's no one left who can help me.
terry,"Baby, come on... not now."
terry,Carter...
carter,"Kind of have a reunion, here."
terry,Let it go!
carter,When are you moving?
carter,We're losing our favorite teacher.
alex,"Look, there's something you should all know."
clear,Alex...
terry,Shut up! The both of you!
ken,It's that girl... Clear.
ken,"He's in the shower, Clear. Can I have him get back at ya? Sure... bye."
alex,"Dad... you and mom have helped me out, so much. But there's... some things I need to understand before I can talk... to anyone about it."
alex,The path of the explosion...  That's Death's design.
schreck,What are you doing?
alex,Checking the air in her tires to make sure they're safe.
schreck,Get in the car.
alex,I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
weine,"""Next?"""
alex,"Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring."
weine," Oh, you've noticed it, too?"
schreck,"Where'd you get this ""pattern"" from? You have another ""vision?"" Maybe saw it in some T.V. static?"
alex,I didn't ask for what happened to me on the plane. You can make fun of me. You can think I'm a nut. I'm used to it. I saved six lives but the entire school acts like I'm a freak. Fine.
alex,I'm not suffering from Post Traumatic Stress. I haven't developed a narcissistic deity complex. I'm not going Dahmer.  This just is. There's a pattern in place for you. And you. There's a design for everyone.
alex, And I'm not sure yet how... but I intend to break this one.
weine,"Alex, you got our attention, at first, because you were under suspicion in the plane explosion."
alex,"No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control."
weine,"Alright, go on. Get outta here."
schreck,Kid gives me the creeps.
weine,We got nothing to hold him.
schreck,"I don't mean that...  There's a couple of times, there... I almost believed him."
weine,"Sometimes, you give me the creeps."
john denver,I've seen it rainin' fire from the sky...
alex,Ms. Lewton!
billy,"Hey, Alex..."
clear,I don't know where he is. He's not talking to me.
weine,Why?
clear,Because I didn't believe him.
schreck,"If he should contact you, it would be in the best interest of your own safety to contact us."
clear,What are you doing?
carter,Terry's name should be on this wall.
clear,"They're watching me, see if I go to Alex."
billy,Are you?
clear,They'll follow my car.  That's why you're taking me.
carter,Why would I want to see him?
clear,Because he knows which one of us is next.
billy,"Um... okay... drive the speed limit, right?"
carter,Billy! I'm gettin' a vision! You're the next one...
billy," Hey, man, why'd you say that?!"
carter,"'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!"
clear,"He could be anywhere from here to a mile down the shore. You guys drive down there, start this way and we'll meet around the middle. It'll take half the time."
alex,"Most kids do, I guess."
clear,Most kids never have it happen.
clear,"When I was ten... my dad went into a 7-11 for cigerettes. I guess he heard somebody say ""Don't turn around."" So on reflex, or thinkin' a friend was jokin'... he did. And the guy blew his head off."
clear,And that is the only way we can beat Death... by making something special out of Life.
alex,This won't be safe.
clear,Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
alex,"No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe."
clear, Nothing is... anymore.
alex,"I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me."
clear,"We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us."
carter,"Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?"
alex,Why do you think I was hiding?
clear,Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
alex,"They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash..."
billy,Your shoe prints were in the blood. Your fingerprints on the knives...
alex,I already told you...
carter, Did you know she was going to be next... before she was?
alex," When she died... at that moment, I could tell she saw something... horrible."
carter,Out of us... who's next to see it?
billy,Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
carter,"Me, right? That's why you're not saying."
billy,"Shoulda felt up Tammy in the pool, that time..."
carter, Whatta you whinin' about? He said I'm next.
clear,He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
carter,You have a responsibility to tell me.
alex,Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
carter,You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
alex,It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
carter,"Aww, fuck... really?"
carter,"Then why bother? What's the fuckin' point? Terry and me will be back together on the other side, so why wait any longer?"
clear,Knock it off!
carter,"May as well go out under my own free will, right?"
clear,Not with us in the fuckin' car!
carter,"What's your fuckin' worry? If it's not your time...? I could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! Only me, right?"
billy,And I fuckin' HATED FRENCH CLASS!
carter,That's what I'm doin'!
clear,"I know what you're doing! It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now."
carter,I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
billy,Watch it! Watch it!
billy,"I am... so close to puking, you don't wanna know."
clear,"We're afraid, too, Carter, but we're not going to quit. Maybe you are. You act like you're not, but you are!"
clear,"So, stop what you're doing and STOP THIS CAR! Right fucking now!"
clear,Move it!
alex,"Billy, get out!"
clear,"Carter, get out!"
carter,It ain't my time.
carter,I can't get out!
billy,"Man, he really is next."
clear,Scared now?
carter,It broke!
billy,No one's that strong.
clear, Bullshit. He saved your life...again!
billy,THAT'S RIGHT! HE'S RIGHT! YOU ARE NEXT! I'M GETTING THE FUCK AWAY FROM YOU!
carter,"SHUT UP, BILLY!"
clear,WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
billy,I DON'T NEED IT EVER! GET AWAY FROM HIM! HE'S NEXT!
carter,"FUCK YOU, BILLY! I'M NOT DEAD!"
billy,YOU WILL BE! YOU'RE DEAD! YOU'RE DEAD!
carter,Jesus fucking Christ!
alex," You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead."
carter,You're the fuckin' devil.
alex, But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
clear,Police are coming.
alex,That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
carter,"""Intervention?"" What are you, God now?!"
alex,Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
clear,You're losin' it. The police will be here. We have to go to the cabin. You can hide there. Get your head together.
alex,After Billy... it's me. And then you.
carter,"Then, get out of here."
alex," I overlooked it. You tried to capitalize. But I caught you, you fuck. I can beat you. Not forever, but I got this cabin rigged to beat you NOW!"
weine,She was up there a minute ago...
clear,I'm not turning him in. There's another life that needs him now.
clear,I go with you.
weine,You can't.
clear,Don't hurt him.
weine,"Tell us where he is. Wait at home, and I promise... we'll bring him back safe, in protective custody."
alex,"I... never moved. Christa asked me to move, but I didn't change seats. I would've moved up... next to Tod... How could I not remember... that... I never moved. Clear's seat was in front of mine..."
schreck,There!
clear,Run!
cut to:,EXT. FOREST - NIGHT - CLOSE - ALEX'S EYES
weine, Lost him.
schreck,From the direction... there's only one place he can heading...
alex,Don't move!
alex,You're grounded in the car. Don't touch anything. DON'T MOVE.
weine,"Alex, get away from there!"
schreck,"Any part of that line touches you, you're dead."
alex,NO!
weine,Get back! You'll both die!
alex,You know what to do.
clear,No! No! Don't!
alex,When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
alex,You know what to do. I'll always be with you.
alex,NO!
schreck,Is he alive?
doctor,A little more. Little more!
doctor,He's here. A beautiful boy.
clear,I felt him! When the baby was born... I felt Alex pass through me... like the night he died...
doctor,13th of May... 4:25 p.m.
barbara,Exactly a year... to the minute.
clear,"We beat it, Alex."
carter,Alex was right.
clear,I believe... that's what Alex believed. But how do we know... this wasn't the design all along?
