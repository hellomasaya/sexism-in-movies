Speaker,Dialogue
serb 2,Fifteen minutes to delivery.
pilot,All clear from above.
pilot,What's happening?
serbian 2,What happened?
serbian 1,We've been hit. We're taking on water.
serbian 1,Something must be below us! Shoot! Shoot!
shane,"Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, United States Navy. I'm gonna get you outta here. But you have to do exactly what I say, when I say it. My way -- no highway option. Do you copy?  Where's the briefcase?"
plummer,How did you know where I...
seal,KEEP SHOOTING!
shane, I've got the Prof and the case. First round's on me back at Virginia Beach.
shane,Hold on.
shane,You know how to swim?
plummer,Oh my God. I can't believe you... how'd we... That was the most incredible...
shane,Better keep that on `til we get to the rendezvous point.
plummer, Why? Poison gas?
shane, No. I'm just not big on chit chat.
charles,"Lieutenant, thank you.  You saved more than just my life today. Can I call my wife to let her know I'm okay?"
shane,Negative. Not imperative to the mission. We have to keep moving. I have strict orders to get you out of here safely.
charles,"I'm safe, Lieutenant. Please. She thinks I'm dead.  Don't you have a family?"
shane, Make it quick.
charles,"Joe, Todd, Lulu, Peter, Tyler."
shane,Negative.
charles,Battery's dead...
shane,We're almost ready.    Just gives us a -
shane,"Captain, sir."
bill,As you were Lieutenant.
shane,... I know sir. And I except full responsibility for the mission's failure.
bill,Why the hell did you let him use the satellite phone?
shane,He had to call his family. A lapse in judgement on my part that I regret sir.
bill,"... Plummer was the best security expert the department of defense ever had -- a genius. He was working on a program that scrambles launch codes. He called it G.H.O.S.T.: Guided High-altitude Scrambling Transmitter. One pulse from the GHOST satellite and a country can't launch its own nukes. That's what the Serbians kidnapped him for, but they couldn't get S inside the briefcase."
shane,"The case was empty sir, as I stated in my report."
bill,"Not a surprise, really. Not like the professor to hide things where someone might look for them. G.H.O.S.T. is still out there,  which is why I'm going to give you another shot."
shane,Sir. Thank you. I... appreciate your confidence.
bill, Negative. It's not that kind of mission.
9.,"BILL She's scared. The family's scared. Whoever killed the professor must think G.H.O.S.T. is in that house. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. Either way, I need someone to stay at that house, and protect them. And while you're there -- find out if the program is in there."
shane,"That's it? Why would you want me for that, sir."
bill,The professor's wife requested you.
bill,... You gotta problem with this mission?
shane,"Sirnosir. It's just that... I've never been very good with kids, sir. Not even when I was a kid sir."
lulu,Mom! There's some weird bald guy at the door!
shane," Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, reporting for duty."
julie,Of course. I'm so sorry.   Thank you for coming.
julie,KIIIDDS!!!
kids,Hi.
julie,And this is Helga and Tyler.
shane, Ma'am... Baby.
julie,"Kids, go finish your homework.   And I'll be checking."
shane,"You have a pleasant family, ma'am."
julie,"Charles wasn't around too much. His work took him all over the world. He'd be gone six or seven months at a time. So I think for the younger ones it's a little confusing. Zoe and Todd... well, they're dealing like your normal teenagers. Maybe in Todd's case semi-normal."
shane,"Mrs. Plummer, I have to tell you that I did everything I could..."
julie,"Charles was in a dangerous business. I knew it when I married him. No one's to blame here.  Everyone thinks that Charles told me or the kids where he hid it. And until G.H.O.S.T. is found, we're all in danger."
shane,Nothing will happen to your family as long as I'm here. I've dealt with much...
julie,That's Gary. He was Charles'.
shane,Mrs. Plummer-
julie,Call me Julie.
shane,"... Mrs. Plummer, I'll go secure the perimeter."
julie,I'm glad you're here-
julie,What is it?
julie,That's wonderful. This could all be over!
julie,I'll be there.
julie,"Don't worry about the Kids, Helga will handle everything.  But if there is an emergency, all the emergency numbers are on the fridge. And on the phone. And on the back door..."
zoe,"Mom -- we'll be fine, chill."
julie," I know, it's just... I am a mom, it's my job to worry. ... I love you guys. I'm gonna miss you. I'll be back in 48 hours. And guys, whatever Lieutenant Wolfe asks you to do... do it. Okay? A ll the children nod in agreement except Zoe who pops her chewing gum bubble."
shane,Don't worry. They'll be safe with me.
helga,"Everything will be fine, Mrs. Plummer."
shane,... No.
helga, Too bad.
shane,Could you turn that dow-
helga,You don't like it? You're the SEAL. You do something. I make bottle.
scott,... Zoe?
zoe,"He's my boyfriend, tool."
shane,So you're the one who broke in. Zoe -- go back inside.
zoe,"Okay, fine... come on Scott."
shane,Not with this kid.  You -- Gimme twenty!
shane,My apologies. We had an intruder. A simple misunderstanding.
shane,Oh. Sorry.
shane,Sorry.
shane,Your mother thought you were in real danger. You should have told her the truth.
zoe,Who do you think you are -- my dad?
shane,Not anymore.
elga,"When you're down and low, lower than the floor. And you feel like you ain't got a chance. Don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the Peter Panda Dance. Just hop three times like a kangaroo --"
shane,This family's in for a rude awakening.
oe,Huh?   Wha--?!
todd,W-what are you doing??!
shane,You're burning daylight. Move.       Move.
odd,It's Sunday...!  And it's six a.m. You're insane.
shane,Now move it!
shane,Hey. Not in front of the kids. S he gives him a look of disbelief.
helga,What's it matter? Nobody speaks Romanian.
shane,Usca mi-as chilotii pe crucea lu mata!
shane,"Listen up, ladies. Your behavior is unacceptable. In order to maintain a state of safety we need to maintain a state of discipline and order. I've only got one rule: Everything is done my way. No highway option. Do you copy?"
lulu,Do you copy?
shane,What?   I said -- do you...
lulu, What?   I said -- do you...
shane,Do not copy me!
ulu,Make up your mind.
shane,"Tracking devices. Now that I know I can't trust you... Never take them off. The panic button is only for emergencies. Touch that -- you better be dying, or you're dead."
zoe,I am not wearing that. Just because my mom's paranoid doesn't mean we have to take orders from you.
shane,"Let me explain how the chain of command works. I tell you what to do -- and you do it. End of chain. Now I'm not gonna have time to learn your names. So you are --  Red 1, Red 2, Red Leader, Red baby... wait, where's the older male? There were five."
helga," He walks like Dracula, with footsteps silent like death --"
zoe,He's in his room.
shane,Red 4!    Open this door!
shane,It didn't have to go down like-
shane,All I need is a hammer and some plaster of Paris. I can fix this.
todd,Can I get by?
shane,"Here's your bracelet. If you'd been wearing it, this wouldn't have happened."
zoe,He has to go.
peter,Whhhoooooo!
lulu,"Stop it, Peter!"
shane,"Hey, hey, good soldiers aren't afraid of anything."
lulu,This house is haunted. Daddy even said so. He said there's a ghost.
shane,Really?   And where is this ghost?
ulu,I don't know.     I've never seen it.
zoe,Here he comes...!
todd,He's coming back-
helga,AHHH!!!
zoe,Uh-oh.
bill,"As we discussed, this is an urgent matter."
julie,Can't you call somebody? Do something to get us around all this paperwork?
bill,"Sorry. Not in Switzerland, I can't."
banker,Marcel!
marcel,Oui.
banker,Je ne comprende pas.
marcel," I'm so sorry, the chief does not speak English. But I can tell you -- you will have access to the box tout-suite. As soon as your background checks clear."
julie,Thank you. How long is that?
helga,AGGH!     These brats!   Sugi Pula!
shane,"Red Leader, remain calm --"
helga,"I am calm. I QUIT, that makes me calm!"
shane,Let's not be hasty.
shane,Red Leader! I command you to come back! That is a direct order! You can't leave a man behind!!
korean woman,"Don't worry, if she loves you, she'll come back."
shane,"Okay, listen up. There's been a change of plans. Your mom's not coming back as soon as she thought..."
lulu, When is she coming back?
shane,"Soon. In the meantime, we're just gonna have some more big fun."
todd,That's what we've been doing?
lulu,But tomorrow's a school day.
zoe,I need a signed release for Driver's Ed!
lulu,I've got Brownies!
shane,"Whoa, WHOA! HALT! We'll take this hill one inch at a time. Only then can we rise to the challenge. All for one, and one for all!"
lulu," ""Be all that you can be!"""
shane,That's Army. I'm Navy.     But I appreciate your enthusiasm.
shane,The things I do for my country.
lulu,Hi. Zoe thinks you look like the Hulk. I think you're cute.
shane, Thank you.
lulu,Do you know Kung Fu?
shane,Affirmative.
lulu,Did you ever punch someone so hard that their head came off?
shane,None of your business.
lulu,I'll trade you a SpongeBob button for it.
shane,"I think -- it's time for you take a nappy- poo, in beddibye land, little girl."
lulu,Do I look like I'm five to you?
shane,What are you waiting for?    Dig in.
zoe,Like I'm really gonna eat all those carbs.
shane,"Okay, ladies. Your mama -- is not here to take care of you now. So -- here's how it's gonna be. We're gonna pull together, all for one, one for all. If I say in, you stay in, if I say out, you go out..."
peter,Ba ba do the hokie pokey...
shane,I did not say at ease!
zoe,"He's only two, he doesn't have any idea what you're talking about. I don't have any idea what you're talking about..."
lulu,Can you kill a man with your bare hands?
shane,You play too many video games.  Yes.
lulu,... I can cross my eyes. Wanna see?
shane,Negative.
lulu,Tyler hates it when I do that...
shane,"Plummer residence... yes, I know it's Monday. Oh. Thank you, sir."
zoe,Who was that?
shane,"Your vice principal. He said if you're late again, you and Todd are expelled. He wants to see you in his office. With your ... legal guardian."
lulu,We're gonna be late.
shane,Not on my watch.
murney,"I always said these kids didn't need a baby sitter, they needed a parole officer. Looks like Mrs. Plummer finally listened."
shane,Wolfe. Shane. Lieutenant. I'm in charge of watching these kids for... a few days.
murney,"aby-sitter huh. Well, whatever work you can get. I'm Murphy. Duane. V.P in charge of discipline, conduct and truancy. Top to bottom, K thru 12. You're in my house now, boy. I coach wrestling, too.  And the creeper here played hookey from every wrestling practice this month."
oman's voice,Your school?
principal claire,"Good morning kids. What are you doing in my office, Murney?"
murney,"I was explaining, that as vice principal, I am in charge of...."
principal claire,Very little. I thought I asked you to find out who stuck to the baloney slices to the cafeteria ceiling with mustard?
murney,I'm got some leads.  My informant's about to crack.
principal claire,Then hop to it. I think I can handle this from here.
principal claire,So. You're the new baby-sitter?
shane,"Bodyguard. You see, Mrs. Plummer called my captain, she thought the kids needed -"
principal claire,"It's okay, Lieutenant, I was briefed of the situation by Mrs. Plummer. She told me all about you."
shane,... You're kidding?
principal claire,Four years at Naval base Coronado.   The Service paid for my college.
shane,"""Honor, Courage..."
principal claire,"Commitment"". That's the way I live my life, and the way I run my school."
shane,Can't be too careful. So. Permission to stick around and keep eyes on the kids?
principal claire,Permission granted. Welcome aboard. Just try not to frighten the children.
shane,No one will even notice I'm here.
shane,Clean as a whistle.
shane,"Give up now. Save us both a world of pain. Now -- last time: Open the hanger, Black Hawk coming in."
principal claire,"What would you say is the secret with kids, Mr. Wolfe?"
shane,Show no weakness.
rincipal claire,I'll drink to that.  Shane... Can I call you Shane?
shane,... Sure.
principal claire,"So. When you agreed to serve your country, I bet you didn't know you'd be serving creamed bananas to one year olds, huh?"
shane,"Hey -- I out rank you, you know."
principal claire,"Not here, you don't. You're on dry land, lieutenant.  Well, not so dry where you're sitting, I guess."
shane,"Oh, man..."
principal claire,"Don't take this personally -- but you're pretty good at this. Seriously, I'm impressed. A whole day, and all three Plummer's stayed out of trouble. That's... unusual."
zoe,"Kick his butt, Todd!"
rincipal claire,Who started this?
murney,He did. 
principal claire,Todd started a fight with five students at once?
murney,The kid's mixed up. Look at him.
principal claire,"If I catch anyone on the team fighting again, next week's tournament is off. I don't care who starts it."
murney,You heard the lady. Any more fighting and there'll be no more wrestling. Personally I think that's a little harsh. Boys'll be boys.  `Scept for Plummer here.
shane,"... Nice moves, man."
murney,"Pretty slick, Frogman -- I'm a black belt myself. S'why they asked me to coach the wrestling team."
shane,"... Sorry, sir. I'm on duty."
murney,"Oh, yeah. That's right. I forgot you had to baby-sit. Maybe some other time then."
principal claire,"... Don't even think it, Murney. He'd kill you so fast, I wouldn't even have time to get my camera."
principal claire,"Another day, another dollar twenty, minus taxes... aren't you gonna change him?"
shane,"I'd love to, for one who'll eat, and not cry."
principal claire,"That's not what I mean, Lt."
shane,Oh -- change him. Roger that. Uh...
principal claire,Sirnosir. Not my job.
shane,But...
principal claire,Instructions are right on the box. Bathroom's down the hall. Have fun.
shane,Emergency!
lulu,See! My nanny can kick your nanny's butt.
shane,Thanks.
construction worker,What hell do you think you're doing?
shane,Tell me where the kids are and I'll let you all live!
construction worker,"Buddy, you're about to get a beat down."
shane,Red 1?   Red 2?
cute cop,"14 year old Male, weird hair. 16 year old female. Ditto.  Cancel that a.p.b.."
claire,Shane are you okay?
shane," Just fine, thank you."
claire,I should probably get going then. If you need anymore help... Call.
brownie,oo hoo! Hubba hubba!
shane,Who are those people?
lulu,"It's my troop, it's Monday. Monday, Wednesday and Saturday are troop nights."
lulu,I can't. Everybody's parents go out on troop nights. They won't be home `til ten. Mom's our den mother.
shane,Selling cookies isn't imperative to my mission.
lulu,"We have to. If we don't sell enough cookies, we can't go the Jamboree, and if we can't go to the Jamboree.  Come on, Shane. You gotta help me out. They already think I'm a loser. And it's not like I have any other friends, cause mom never lets me out of her sight..."
shane,"Alright, ladies. Here's how it's gonna be. Tonight, I'm gonna be your den -- commander. That means if you want to live to see tomorrow, do as I say. DO WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER?"
brownie,Den Mother? ... I'm scared of you.
shane,Good. Now -- wait here.
zoe,"... yeah, he's a total psycho. I think mom found him from one of those Tough Love boot camps or something..."
zoe,This is totally cruel and unusual! You can't do this -- we could run out of air!
zoe,".. he's got us on lock-down, it's like Oz or something. No, not munchkin Oz -- HBO Oz.  Hm... I dunno if that's a good idea, Scott..."
shane,"I gotta get supplies. I can see you through the window, but if anything happens..."
lulu, I know.
brownie,Oh no... they're back.
shane,Where are my troops?
shane,What happened?  Well?
lulu,Those boys over there broke our cookies.
shane,Well then -- I'm afraid I have to eliminate them. If I don't come back -- avenge my death.
brownies,No!
shane,"This is not a toy. I'm here to protect you. Not cookies. Get in the car, we're going home."
brownie,"You can't take us home yet, you're supposed to take us to dinner."
shane,Where?
manager,Welcome to Chuck E. Cheese!
shane,I wish I were in Chechnya.
manager,Anything elsh I can do for you?
shane,In a big glass    This much ice... this much cyanide.
manager,How `bout a re-fill on that pischer of Mischer Pibb?
shane,What?
manager, Pischer of Mischer Pibb?   Mischer Pibb?
lulu,Let's fight!
shane,I'm watching your brother...
lulu,I pressed two player. I thought you liked combat. Unless you're scared.
shane,That's not fair. Nobody can jump thirty feet.
lulu,The Hulk can.
shane,That wasn't a documentary.
lulu,You wanna switch?
shane, You don't have a baby on your chest...
lulu,You're not even trying...
shane,I AM TOO TRYING.
lulu,Too slow... come on -- take a shot... oops too slow... swing and a miss...
zoe,Mom -- stop worrying.
zoe,"Seriously, everything's cool. The guy's just a control freak."
julie,"It's only a few more days. I hate leaving you, but you know I have to do this. I love you."
zoe,"I know. Don't worry, we're okay. Tonight I'm just doing homework -- in my cell."
zoe,"Dude, this is outta hand. Who are all these people?"
scott,Jus' ma peeps. And the folks who read my BLOG.
zoe,"Dude, not cool..."
shane,"Move, move, move! Go go!"
manager,I figured you'd come back for him -- they almost always do.
shane,"Inexcusable, to leave a man behind like that..."
manager,"Relax, we once found a kid in the ball pool when we opened in the morning --"
lulu,Should we send someone in after him?
shane,Clear out! GO GO GO!
shane,Party's over.
shane,"No one leaves until this house is spotless! I want to be able to eat off the floor! The latrine! Hell, I wanna be able to eat in the kitchen!!"
scott,This is officially the worst party ever.
zoe,It was YOUR idea! I don't even know most of these losers.
zoe,"... Thanks a lot, Rambo. My friends will never come here again."
shane,Those people aren't your friends. They show no respect for you or your house. Because you have no respect for yourself.
zoe,I do too respect myself.
shane,"You got barf on your tank top.  Company, downstairs!"
zoe,You're not my dad!
shane,"You're right, Red 1. I'm not the man for this job."
lulu,Shane --!
shane,"In all my years I have never been treated with such disrespect. Not even from the enemy. Don't worry, as soon as your mom comes back, I'm gone."
zoe, It's Scott...
shane,Puberty... talking doesn't do any good. Go to your rooms.
ninja,GHOST -- hand it over!
shane,Okay -- who wants some?
furbies,Ow! Ow!
shane,Kids.   It's safe. You can open up.
lulu,Please don't leave us Shane.
shane,I'm not going anywhere.
zoe,I'm sorry for giving you a hard time.
shane,Shhh... It's okay.
todd,Who were they? What did they want...?
shane,"They're looking for a program, that your father invented."
zoe,So Mom's not paranoid? There really are people out to get us.
shane,"They're not after you. They want this. But nothing's gonna happen to you, as long as I'm here. And I'm not going anywhere."
shane,C'mon c'mon c'mon...
zoe,"Hey mom we're fine, absolutely nothing happened you should worry about. Nope."
shane,Mrs. Plummer... two men tried to get into the house tonight.
julie,Oh my god!
shane,"No - it's okay. They're gone, everyone's fine. They were looking for GHOST, but they didn't find it. You have any luck?"
julie,"Well, yes and no. We found something in the box... But we're not sure what it is. Bill thinks it's part of the GHOST. It looks like some kind of ""key"". We just don't know what its for."
shane, ...So soon? We were just starting to have fun. Don't worry -- we'll be just fine.
shane,"I gotta warn you guys: From now on, I'm gonna be sticking even closer."
second graders,Ooooooooh! 
shane,"Don't worry. So, she wrecked a driver's Ed. car -- she'll pay for the damage..."
murney,"That? Lady drivers, what do you expect. No, it's not that -- it's the boy..."
shane,Red two? I mean Todd?
principal claire,"Ordinarily I would wait for his mother to return... but -- I'm a bit concerned, and I'm not sure what to do..."
shane,Has he been skipping class?
principal claire,Well -- yes. He does always miss sixth period. But this...
murney,This is how he showed up to practice. And that's not all. I was doing a little re- con in his locker... and I found this:
shane,He's not a NAZI.
principal claire,It's certainly not normal.  See if you can talk to the boy.   Find out what's going on.
murney,"hope you won't go light on him -- that whole family's no good, if you ask me."
shane,I'll talk to him.
murney,"You're a good man, Shane. Bet you're a hell of a fighter on the mats, huh?  Maybe sometime we oughta strap up, we'll give these boys a treat."
shane,"Another time, maybe..."
murney,It's a date then. I'll show you a couple moves. I promise I won't hurt you.
shane,Did you kick me in the back? Is there a footprint on my jacket?
murney,Come on Frogman! Don't be a sissy!
shane,"Wait Todd, I want to talk to you..."
shane,Smart kid.
man,"Alright. All my Nazis are finally here. Okay, I want all of you at attention."
director,Okeydokey. Starting from where we left off Gimme Rolf and Liesl -- let's give You are Sixteen a run up der flagpole...
todd,"You wait little girl, on an empty stage/for fate to turn the light on/your life little girl, is an empty page/that men will want to write on..."
todd,"You are sixteen, going on seventeen..."
director,"Baby Jesus, have I done some unspeakable evil that I deserve to be saddled with the world's worst production of Sound of Music?  We open in a week. The set's not finished... The cast is a bunch of clumsy goats -- every kick ball change would make Bob Fosse dig himself out of the earth, so he could have a heart attack again."
todd,I'm sorry... I'll get it right.
director,"None of you will ever get it right! Which is why, I quit."
liesl,You gonna fix him?
shane,No. My hands are freezing.
todd,I'm not going to quit. I hate wresting...
shane,"AT EASE.  Would you listen, just once? Look, I don't know a hell of a lot about this kinda stuff, but... You're good. A lot to learn, but with hard work, discipline -- you could make a go of this."
todd,... but what about Murney?
shane,That guy's an idiot.
todd,You don't seem like the musical type.
shane,Come on. Julie Andrews was hot.
todd,What if... girls'll think I'm... weird or something?
shane,You know what girls think is weird? Wrestling. Men in leotards pinning each other to the floor? I've never understood that. Chicks dig guys who can dance.
todd,Doesn't matter now anyway... show's off... it's over.
shane,COMPANY -- CENTER STAGE!
liesl,We don't have a director...
shane,"No director? I have directed rescue missions in Afghanistan! I've directed numerous snatch and grabs in countries who's names you are not allowed to know. I have choreographed multi-pronged amphibious landings and stealth air attacks!  Do you think I have the stomach to whip this production into shape, or not?"
todd,Yes.
shane,YES WHAT?
shane,... What's up?
zoe," Nothing... It's stupid... Scott. I called him in his room, another girl picked up the phone. I know it's no big deal. I don't know why I let it get to me."
shane,I don't see what you see in this guy.
zoe,"It's just nice to think someone's thinking about you, you know? S SHANE  It won't happen again."
zoe,... No wait! ...What are you gonna do? You're not gonna hurt him are you? Promise you won't touch him.
shane,Okay. I promise. I won't touch him.
ulu,Tell me a story.
shane,Okay. Let's see. Once there was a family of Elves. 
68.,"SHANE One day, the little Elf family -- Uh. Went into the magic forest. To find a secret gnome... facility, where gnomes where turning mushrooms into... Uranium. The elves had to go in and take it out."
ulu,Why?
shane,"They were ordered to. By the Elf Unit commander at Elf station bravo. So -- they waited for cloud cover, and they came in from the north..."
odd,You have to do the Panda Dance... or he won't stop.
shane,"Oh, c'mon... I can't remember that thing."
todd,I'll write it down for you...
shane,"When you're down and low, lower than the floor. And you ain't got a chance. Don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the Panda Dance..."
todd,You have to do the dance. Like dad used to do. He made it up for him.
shane,What are you looking at?
shane,Today you drive.
zoe,But -- I can't even pass driver's Ed.
shane,Exactly.
zoe,Have you given a driving lesson before?
shane,"N ot in a car, no... but it's a lot like a Bradley Assault Vehicle."
todd,Especially when Zoe's driving.
shane,Do you know what causes most accidents? ttention span. The most important thing is that you keep an absolute focus on...
zoe,What?!?
shane,No. Keep going. I trust you.
shane,"Good. Next lesson, 1500 hours."
zoe,Ha ha ha. Very funny. T hey head into the school.   Shane spots something.
shane,I know 437 ways to hurt a man without touching him. Broken promises lead to broken legs. Do we understand each other?
rincipal claire,CHILDREN... STOP RUNNING!!
shane,Wow.   I'm glad I never had you for a CO.
principal claire," I've noticed improvement in your troops lately, too. Noon and none of them have been called to my office. It's a miracle. S he sits beside him, and offers him a milk."
shane,Thanks.
principal claire,"This old thing? Well, you never know who you're going to run into."
murney,I've had it. I just caught this boy dancing under the bleachers like some kind of Bavarian fruitcake.
todd,Hey. I'm right here. Talk. E veryone is shocked that Todd talked back. A hushed whisper goes through the cafeteria. Murney turns around.
murney,You got something to say? Boy?
todd,"Yeah. Yeah I do. I quit, Murney."
murney,"Winners never quit, boy. What're you so scared of, Freak?"
todd,I am not scared. I... I want to sing.
murney,A musical? You're blowing off wrestling for a musical?  This is what happens when there's no man in the house.
todd,"There is a man in my house -- me.  Let's get one thing clear. I'm not quitting cause I hate wresting. I'm quitting because you're a bad coach. You suck. The whole team wants to quit. I'm the only one with the guts to do it. M urney looks over at the Team. They look to the ground sheepishly, Todd's telling the truth. Murney looks around, humiliated, furious --"
urney,So -- you're a tough guy now?
shane,You said you wanted to wrestle. You win. Let's do it.
murney,After school. The Gym. Your ass is mine.
shane,I'll be sure to lock up when I'm through.
todd,Pinned!
shane,"Dislocated nerve, that's all. He'll be fine in  two months."
todd,That was awesome.
shane," Let's go, Todd. I got my troops waiting."
shane,"If you're ever lost in the woods, the first thing you have to do is find a source of drinking water! And make sure it's potable. If you're not sure, boil it for thirty minutes!"
lulu,We're Brownies.
shane,"No brownies   either. A lot of roots are edible. So    is some tree bark. When I HALO'd into   Rwanda, I lived off the underground   fern stem for three weeks!"
brownie,He's eating Roly-Polies!
shane, Wots of pwotien!
odd,"... your life little girl, is an empty page/that men will want to write on... T odd tries the spinning kick, but blows it, landing hard. Shane blows a WHISTLE."
shane,Why don't we just let the Nazis win tonight -- huh? Now. From the top -- think of yourself as a gazelle prancing over the plains. Graceful.
shane,"Don't touch that dial sleep for a while -- HEAAAY! And say good night, Peter Panda."
peter," Good night, daddy."
shane,"I'm not your daddy, Peter. But sweet dreams."
lulu,Go away and we won't hurt you.
lulu,Uh oh. You're gonna have to pay for that.
lulu,"From now on, you do things our way -- no highway option!"
brownies,"I don't care what has been said, Brownies rock! Full speed ahead! Give me guff, I'm in your face! Brownies rule the human race!"
shane,Sound off!
brownies,One two! Three four! One TWO THREE FOUR!
todd,West Side Story auditions in two weeks...
shane,It's all in the wrist...
zoe,Don't worry.    I'm not gonna jump.
shane,What's wrong... Scott?
zoe,"o. Scott's fine. I don't know what you did, but he's really straightened up. Flowers, phone calls. ...I've never been in love like this before."
shane,How long you been together?
zoe,A month...
shane,That's longer than any relationship I've ever had.
zoe,"You're okay, Shane. I'm not used to anyone giving me the benefit of the doubt. My teachers don't trust me. Mom doesn't. My dad didn't care about us, he was never here..."
shane," Hey. Your father cared about you very deeply. He told me you were the greatest things in his life. That what's bothering you? Cause -- we can talk about it, if you want."
zoe,I miss him so much...
shane,"This was my dad's. He was the only family I ever had. Mom left when I was little, cause dad was always gone. Two years in... an indisclosable locale. Another six in... Another indisclosable locale. I didn't really have a home, so I went to military school -- then one day my mom got the letter. No more dad."
zoe,"That's horrible, Shane."
shane,The hardest part was living without any details...why? How? Where? I always wondered if he thought about me.
oe,Me too.   So how did you get through it?
shane,You could say I just shut down my emotions. I turned off all feelings and dedicated myself to becoming the perfect soldier.
oe,I never even got to say good bye.
julie,"The red tape is cleared up, we're on the first plane in the morning."
zoe,Mommy's coming home! Mommy's coming home!
todd,When?
zoe,Tomorrow morning!
peter,Mama!
shane,Just another assignment. No reason for personal attachments.
83.,SHANE I guess you've got it good.    Kids to play with. Three squares a day.
shane,"What happened, Gary?"
shane,Sir! Excellent news. I think I found GHOST.
bill,... Do you have it?
shane,"No. It's in a steel vault. I've been trying all night, can't crack it, sir."
ill," Good! Good work. Okay, don't do anything further. We'll be there shortly -- don't do anything `til I get there."
shane,"One things for sure. After we turn this in to my CO, whoever's been bothering you guys won't be bothering you anymore."
lulu,"But, Shane -- does that mean you'll have to go?"
shane,You guys better get ready.    Your mom should be home soon.
julie,"I had a fight with Zoe when I left, so they probably trashed the place..."
bill,What's wrong?
kids voices," ... with songs they have sung, for a thousand years..."
zoe,"Welcome home, mom."
bill," Good job, Lieutenant."
ill,"I'm really proud of you, Shane. I'm giving you your choice of assignment, anywhere you want. You just name it."
shane,"That's kind of you, Sir... pause) But I'll have to think about it."
bill,I should hope not.
shane,But being with these kids has made me feel like there's more to life than taking out your enemy. And I think I want to explore that some more.
man's voice,PUT YOUR HANDS UP!!
shane,Mr. and Mrs. Chun?     They checked out-
korean man,H ands up!
shane,NOW!
korean man, You promised us GHOST months ago!
bill,"I'm sorry, Mr. Chun. There were delays..."
bill,He won't be baby-sitting you anymore.
julie,I trusted you. Charles trusted you. So did the Department of Defense.
ill,North Korea pays better.  Keep an eye on them. You -- with me.
bill,You bring your stethoscope?
ill,Charles never made things easy.
oe,Now Peter!
lulu,Hi ya!
julie,AGGGH!
bill,"Relax -- I've got the keys, they're not going anywhere..."
oe,Omigod!   What are we doing??!
todd,Let's look for a cop!
bill,How does it work?
julie,How does what work?
bill,Don't play dumb. It's getting old. I want to know how to get through the booby traps. What's the code?
julie,I don't know any code -- Charles didn't tell me about the room...
bill,"If I knew Charles had hidden it so well, I wouldn't have killed him so soon. Don't make me kill you too."
ill,... Do it.
julie,NO!
bill,Change of plan. Bring them back unharmed.
zoe,What's taking you?
todd,Don't wait for me!
peter,Wheee!
shane,Anybody got any perfume?          Hair spray... breath freshener...
ill,You think this is a game?! S SHANE But... That was the code! I swear! I saw Plummer use it on his briefcase.
bill,"Code or no code, go get it -- now."
julie, You can't make him do this -- He doesn't have a chance.
shane, Haven't got a chance.
julie,QUICK LIKE A TURTLE LIE ON YOUR BACK!
lulu,Look out Zoe! Rollers!
cute cop,I'd say you could lose your license -- but you haven't got one!
zoe,"People are trying to kill us. They have my mom, and our bodyguard -- you have to follow me!"
cute cop,Just pull over!
zoe,Fine. Don't follow me!
murney,"That Baloney Bandit struck again. I accept full responsibility. My intelligence proved to be faulty, but if I had more resources..."
shane,"Wriggle like a snake `til you can't no more. Then better jump quick, like there ain't no floor."
bill,"Thank you, Shane. You were always my best man. I knew you'd figure it out."
shane,"I was devoted to you, sir. And you betrayed all of that. All that we stand for."
bill,"I'll take that as a ""no."""
shane,There will be no mercy.
bill,None requested.
shane,You're a... terrible neighbor.
julie,Shane!   Watch out!
bill,Any last words?
shane,"... Say, good night, Peter Panda!"
todd,Zoe! You're going too fast!! You're not gonna have enough time to stop-
zoe,"Hey, I'M the one in Driver's Ed!    I think I know what I'm doing!!"
shane,... GHOST.
julie,Thank you Shane. It's finally over. Now we can go back to our peaceful...
shane,"Whoa, WHOA!    What are you doing to these kids??"
cute cop,FREEZE. HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.
zoe,"But, officer..."
cute cop,"I said FREEZE. Zoe, you're in a lot of trouble... Reckless endangerment! Driving without a license. Numerous, uh... trafficS violations --"
shane, These kids are heroes. They just aided in exposing a high-level espionage ring. I suggest you call the FBI. Now.
cute cop,You expect me to believe any of that?
principal claire,Ya!!
cop,I think I'll call the FBI.
shane,Just doing my job.
lulu,Do you have to wear that thing in your ear all the time?
fbi agent,Yes.
lulu,Does it itch?
fbi agent,Yes...
zoe,"If you're reading this, then Julie found the key. Julie, Tyler, Peter, Zoe, Todd, Lulu -- I want to say: I love you more than anything. I always have."
principal claire,"So. What happens now? You'll be stationed somewhere else, right? I guess there's no more reason for you to stick around here."
shane,"Well. I'm kinda, re-conning the situation, here... And to tell the truth. I don't see anything but reasons to stay. P RINCIPAL CLAIRE So... What's the next move?"
shane,... I don't know. I'm on dry land. You're the superior office. You tell me.
principal claire,"Well. Summer's almost here. What if you and me did a little amphibious recon mission. On, say -- Maui?"
shane,Sir yes sir.
lulu,This is it. Your work here is through. Guess you have to go now...
shane,"Ah, come here you."
zoe,But...
shane,"He would've wanted me to give it to someone I care about. Like he did. Thank you. For everything. P ETER Love you, Shane."
shane,Your dad would be so proud.
lulu,"Shane, we're never gonna see you again!"
shane,What are you talking about?      I'm gonna see you Friday night.
julie,What's Friday night?
shane,"Tonight is the night we trained for, and failure is not an option! No detail is too small! We are the BEST! Remember your lines, hit your marks, and stay in character! I expect perfection! "
106.,SHANE Now let's break a leg.
