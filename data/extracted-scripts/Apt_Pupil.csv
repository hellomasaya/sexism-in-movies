dussander," A boy.  I don't need anything, boy.  Can't you read?  I thought all American boys could read.  Don't be a nuisance, now.  Good day."
dussander,Give me my newspaper.
dussander,Fine.
dussander,I'd be out of my mind to let an insane boy like you into my home.
dussander,Do you?  Good for you.
dussander,Your what?
dussander,Accelerated?
dussander,I see...
todd,What?
todd,"Actually, I'm pretty low maintenance.  That's what my dad says."
todd,"But even then I couldn't be sure.  I needed real proof.  So I went to the mall and bought a fingerprint kit from the hobby shop and a book that tells you what you're supposed to look for and then dusted your mailbox while you were at the movies.  Pretty smart, huh?"
dussander,Bourbon.
todd,Milk?
dussander,Milk.
todd,A violation?
dussander,Yes.
dussander,That fucking name.  Enough of that.  I demand it.
dussander,I demand --
dussander,Nicotine gum.
todd,Hang up the phone.
dussander,This is unforgivable.  Do you know the things you're accusing me of?
todd,Do it.
dussander,Hear about what?
dussander,Everything?
dussander,You're a monster.
joey," Take it easy, Jesus.  It's just me, flinch- man."
todd,Who?
todd,You going to tell me who it is?
todd,Fine.
joey,Becky Trask.
todd,Was that so hard?
todd,It what?
todd,Tell me.  Tell me.
todd,What did it do?
dussander,It made them dance.
todd,Dance?
todd,"Yeah, I bet."
dussander,How do you eat this crap everyday?
dussander, I was the commandant of the camp.
todd,Forget it.  I can't concentrate.
todd,I know...
dick," No, son. If you weren't enjoying it, then you shouldn't play."
dick,"He'll be fine without you. He was fine before and he'll be fine after. There's nothing wrong with wanting to help people, but you gotta make sure you got yourself squared away first. That's what matters."
dick,"Just checking.  All right... We'll give your way a shot. If you think you can do it, if you really do, and your serious, then... okay. You really like the old guy, don't you?"
dick,"Okay, okay.  Don't ever force it.  Watch."
dussander,Leave me alone.
todd,And you let them eat the soup?
dussander,"...But, as the war pressed on, the time for such civilized measures became a luxury.  I remember by April of '45, we had barely enough food to feed ourselves.  The sound of the Russian mortars grew louder everyday, but still, the train cars from France and Poland kept coming.  This was a time of desperation. The ovens burned day and night and still I knew we would not beat the arrival of the Russian forces.  Many of my men, the cowardly ones, deserted during the night.  But the men that remained, the same ones I had called upon so many times, ...continued the work. At first we thought a massive fire in the main building would serve our purpose.  We could just crowd them in and pull a gas torch up to each of the windows.  But with so many of them, we couldn't be sure the bodies would burn properly.  We needed something ...certain.  Then a young, bright soldier, I shall never forget his enthusiastic smile, pointed to a pair of bulldozers near the Western gate which had been used during construction.  How perfectly simple it was. The bulldozers carved a narrow trench, four meters deep, down the center of the camp. For two hours they dug until I realized we may not have enough gas to finish the job. So the inmates were given shovels and told they were building a shelter from the incoming artillery.  When they were done, I immediately called for a practice drill and three thousand naked bodies began to march into the trench.  It took less than twenty minutes to get them in place.  Quickly the bulldozers moved down the sides of the pit sending the piles of earth into the massive grave.  Those who tried to free themselves were shot, of course, but very few cartridges were wasted that day.  The machines were too fast.  Back and forth they went... packing the dirt.  One by one the tractors ran out of gas and my men had to scurry along with shovels.  But by sunset... it was done.  I gave the order to evacuate.  In the distance the plumes of Russian mortar fire rose like an approaching thundercloud.  But I knew that no matter what happened, ...no one would ever forget what we did here."
todd,"Yeah, I'm fine."
todd,"No... No, I'm cool."
dussander,Here kitty-kitty.  Here kitty-kitty.
todd,I'm sorry.
todd,"No, I do."
monica,Todd loved that dog.  A lot more than Dick did.
agnes,"I remember when you had to put it down, Todd cried for two weeks.  Just about broke my heart."
monica,It's very humane.
dussander,I see.
monica,Todd Bowden!
dick, My dad is very proud of the fact that the Bowden men have hit every major conflict since the Civil War.
dick,Forget it.
todd,Our advantage?  Our advantage?
dussander,Lower your voice.  People will hear.
todd,So what?
dussander,What for?
todd,Just to be safe.
dussander, To hell with this.  You open it.
todd,"Oh, relax, old man.  Sit down and open it."
todd,Merry Christmas!
dussander,I should smash you.
todd,"Do it.  Please.  Indignities?  What you've suffered with me is nothing compared to what the Israelis would do to you.  Remember what happened to Eichmann?  You forget that, I think.  And, you know, that's my fault.  I have let you forget.  You have gotten comfortable with this situation.  Well, don't you for one minute ever forget who holds the cards here. Don't you ever forget that envelope under my mattress.  I tried to do this the nice way, I tried to do something to please you, but you don't want it.  So fine, we'll do it the hard way.  You will put this on because I want to see you in it.  Now strip."
dussander,Good Gott.
todd,Actung!
dussander," Come out. ...Come out, now!"
todd,Fuck if I know.
joey,What?
todd,What?
todd,No.
joey," All right, man.  Whatever you say.  Look, I got to get to practice."
todd," You're talking to yourself, Bowden.  You're talking to yourself, Bowden."
todd,Something's come up.  Sit down.
dussander,I see.  What seems to be the trouble?
dussander,Looks like you have a problem then.
todd,Don't be so sure.
dussander," 'Dear Mr. and Mrs. Bowden, this note is to suggest that we have a group conference concerning Todd's first semester grades.  In light of his previous good work in this school, the sudden deterioration in his grades suggest a specific problem which should be addressed before his academic advancement is jeopardized permanently.  Such a problem can often be solved by a frank and open discussion.  I am ready to work out a time for us to meet.  In a case such as this, earlier is usually better.  Sincerely yours, Edward French.'  Who is this Edward French, the headmaster?"
dussander,Or to the reformatory.
todd,What did you say?
dussander,Why would I do that?
todd,"For friendship, because you're lonely and had no one in your life.  No jury would take your word over mine.  A Nazi?  Forget it.  Just get it out of your head.  You can't threaten me and you can't scare me.  What you can do is find me a pencil."
dussander,"A pencil, what for?"
dussander,Will this do?
dussander,"Mr. French, a pleasure."
dussander,And the shoes work?
dussander,"Yes, please do."
dussander, The mother drinks.
french,Oh.
french,That's bad.  Has Mrs. Bowden thought about getting professional help for her problem?
dussander,Indeed.
dussander,Of course.
french,"Yes, well --"
french,Mid-quarter.  That's about three weeks into the new marking period.
french,"Yes, that's right."
todd,You what?
dussander," Listen, boy.  Before today it was possible, just barely possible, that you could have denounced me and come out clean yourself. The way your nerves have been lately I don't think so, but never mind that.  It was - at least technically possible.  But now things have changed.  Today I impersonated your grandfather, one Victor Bowden.  And it was you who arranged the meeting.  What would people make of that?  If things come out now... perhaps you were right, your age and a good attorney might keep you out of jail, but you would be humiliated, boy, publicly.  You would be infamous.  Your parents too.  Do you know what such a scandal would do to them? To you?  Think about that."
todd,You fucker.
todd,Shhh.
todd,Fuck.
todd,"Well, maybe... I have to check."
archie,"You know,  For a dollar I'll give you a blow job.  Take you right up there where it's still dry.  You never had so good, kid.  You'll come your brains out."
todd,"Anything, really."
todd,Then what?
todd,You can't... you can't do that.
dussander,"No, I suppose I won't."
morgan,"Have a seat, Todd."
morgan,She failed it.
french,Chong.
todd,No.
todd,"Thanks, I guess."
todd,Thanks.
todd,Yeah.
french,"Todd, wait."
todd,I am.
french," Okay, Todd.  I know this isn't the place to talk about this.  But my door is always open..."
todd,I know.  Thanks.
joey,Hey there.
todd,Hey.
todd,Thanks.
todd,You busy now?
joey,Uhh...
joey,This is so cool.
joey,Here.  Take it.
archie,I can do that.  I can help you carry those.
dussander,I don't need any help. ...Excuse me.
archie, You got a nice face.
dussander,No I don't.
dussander,Piss off.
dussander,I see.
dussander,A drink.
archie,"Yeah, this is nice.  Real nice."
dussander,Let me take those.  Right this way.
dick,No.
monica, I thought you told him.
dussander,Perhaps.
archie,Maybe even twenty.
dussander,Perhaps.  We shall see.
todd,"Way to go, Mom."
dick,That's not the point.  You should always read the bill before you sign.  I've told you that a hundred times.  Fifteen hundred dollars.
todd,Well if you put it that way --
todd,Bye.  I've got to run over to Mr. Denker's for a minute.
todd,See you in a bit.
todd,What the fuck...?
todd,What did you say?
todd,Fuck this.
dussander,Hello?
dussander,"Stay calm, boy.  You are doing fine."
todd,Fuck off.
dussander,Is that my undershirt?
dussander,I think we're okay.
todd,Me too.
dussander,Call an ambulance.
todd,The key.
dussander,"For God's sake, boy..."
dussander,What for?
todd,Mr. Denker had a heart attack.
todd,"Yeah, he's awake."
todd,Okay.
todd,"Goddamn you, come out."
todd,Dad.
nurse,He needs to rest now.  You can come back tomorrow after ten.
nurse, The doctor will be in to see you in a few minutes.
ben,Thank you.
dussander,I see.
dussander,Arthur.
dussander,I'm retired.
bank clerk,I sure hope your granddaddy feels better. You can bring that in here.
todd,Son of a bitch.
dussander,You shouldn't have.
todd,What?
todd,I should go.
ben,Good-bye.
dussander,Where's the nurse?
weiskopf, No one else is here.
weiskopf,The man in the next bed was Benjamin Krauss. He was imprisoned for ten months at Patin. You were responsible for the death of his wife and two daughters.  His identification of you was quite specific.  I'm sure his reward from my government will help offset the burden of his broken leg.
weiskopf,Please don't bother.  Your papers will not stand up to serious examination and you know it.
dussander,Who are you men?  What are your names?
todd,Huh?
todd,"Oh, ...working."
todd,Mr. French.
french,No.  I'm his guidance counsellor.
woman,"Monica, I thought that was you."
todd, That's our cue.
french, It was nice meeting you.
dick,"You too.  Good luck, son."
richler,What about this?
monica,Honey.
monica,What's wrong?
weiskopf,Hello.
weiskopf,I'm a school teacher.
todd,Yeah.  I never knew of that other name till I saw it in the paper.
richler,How did you know him?
todd,I met him at the movies.  Last summer.  ...He asked me where to pick up the number seven bus.  He said his eyes weren't too good. ...Will you excuse me for a minute?
monica,"You okay, honey?"
todd,That's right.
dick,It isn't?
richler,No.
richler,"Why not, Todd?"
todd,Guys that are blind don't normally go scooting out to steal letters.
richler, True.  Did Dussander have any friends that you knew of?
todd,"No, not really."
todd,"No.  He hardly ever spoke German.  He always said he would teach me someday, but he never got around to it."
richler,That's right.
todd,No.
richler,"Okay, thanks."
todd,Yeah... fine.
todd,"I'm fine, Dad."
todd,"I know, Dad."
todd,"I know, Dad."
todd,Sure.
french,"Hello, Todd."
todd,No.
french,I will.  But first I need a couple of things explained to me.
french,What?
french,Whoa.  To--
