Speaker,Dialogue
passengers, What ladies?
libbets," Great, thanks for the tip."
paul, The Idiot.
paul,How do you know this shit?
nixon," Well, with regard to the questions as to why Americans feel we were wrong to make the tapes, that is not particularly surprising. I think that most Americans do not like the idea of taping conversations and, frankly, it is not something that particularly appeals to me..."
ben," Hey, that's the president of the goddam United States you're talking about, Wendy!"
ben, Want another?
paul," Hey Charles. Charles, calm down -- I wasn't in on it."
dorothy,Ted took me to see it.
dorothy,"I have to say, the movie didn't do much for me. But being in that theater, surrounded by all those horny young college boys and perverts, there was something in the air that --"
dorothy," So fascinating. Do you get free tickets to the movies, that kind of thing?"
ben, And as usual no one believed me...
janey, It's really quite all right.
janey,Ironic?
dorothy," Well, um, yes. Ironic. His name is Rod."
sandy,Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
mikey, Who said so?
sandy,No one.
mikey,I don't have a girlfriend.
wendy, Good-night dad.
elena, You're staring at me.
shackley," Brilliant, brilliant."
george, Right o'.
harold, I'd asked for that double martini about three hours ago!
harold,"-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --"
ben,"But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --"
ben,-- What advice? You never --
harold,"That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --"
ben,-- 73
harold,"-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance."
philip, No need to make excuses --
beth, She said you licked Dave Brewster's weenie in the third floor bathroom.
mikey, Did anybody hear that?
philip,"It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --"
philip, They say you never forget.
elena, Forget what?
sandy,Hey Wendy.
wendy,Hey Sandy.
sandy,Mikey was looking for you.
wendy,Yeah? See ya.
mikey, I'm chewing.
wendy, Did you tell Sandy?
ben,"We were golfing, and you know, golfing to me is something I'm supposed to enjoy, and I was on the goddam golf team in college, so it's something one would assume I do well -- I used to do well -- but basically these days golfing for me is like hoeing, or plowing."
janey,Ben--
ben,Yeah?
janey, You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
ben,You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
janey,You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
ben,Gotcha.
ben,Can't wait to see how it fits in with all the other instruments.
elena,The Halfords have invited us again this year.
ben,You want to go?
elena,What do you think?
ben,"Well, it is a neighborhood tradition."
elena,So early?
ben,Rough day. Good night.
elena,Is that a new aftershave?
sandy,Yeah. But I just need some help with my homework.
mikey, You were gone?
jim," Yeah Mikey. Yep, I was in Houston, working on some great new ideas about silicon, which comes from sand, very conductive. How you guys doing? How's school?"
jim, You bet.
jim," Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed."
jim," You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?"
elena, Take care.
harold,It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
janey,Here you are.
elena, Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
sandy,You going to tell dad?
janey,Would it matter?  And what's that?
sandy," You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico."
janey,"It's not packed with explosives, is it?"
janey, Play with the whip.
janey,Oh. Hi Wendy.
wendy,Hi Mrs. Williams.
janey,"Mikey, have you heard the explosions coming from the backyard?  Do you know what Sandy's been up to?"
mikey, I dunno.
janey,Don't you kids have homework?
sandy,"They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up."
janey, Shit.
ben,"Um, yes."
elena,"Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--"
ben, Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
ben, Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul. I almost forgot.
elena,You were saying?
ben,Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
elena,That shirt?
ben,What?
elena,Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
wendy,You have to follow me?
mikey,I dunno. I --
ben,"Hey there Mikey, how's business?"
mikey," Business? Uh, I dunno."
ben,I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
wendy,Nah.
ben,What you been up to?
wendy,Nothing.
ben,So how's school treating you?
paul,All right.
paul,Good.
paul,Fine.
paul,Hnnn.
paul,Yeah.
paul, About?
paul,It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
wendy,With who?
paul,Her name's Libbets.
wendy,Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
elena,The turkey in?
ben,Stuffed and baking.
ben,Anyone home?
paul,I'll be out in a second.
janey," Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her."
ben,Huh?
janey,Birth control.
ben,Right. Gotcha.
ben,Water bed! Dig it!
wendy,I don't know.
mikey,Why did you -- with Sandy?
wendy,I don't know.
mikey,You like him? He worships you.
wendy,"Hey, what's this?"
mikey,Wendy!
wendy, I won't take my pants off. But I'll touch it. That's as far as it goes.
mikey, When worlds collide.
wendy," Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff."
wendy,Yeah.
ben,I'll carry you up the drive.
ben,You go dry off now.
ben,Never guess where I found her.
paul,See you.
ben,Stay out of trouble.
elena,You'll be on the 10:30 train?
paul,11:30?
elena,Paul --
ben,Ah let the guy have his fun. What's the name of this girl with the Park Avenue address?
paul,Libbets. Libbets Casey.
ben,Libbets? What kind of name is Libbets?
tv,... and that ends today's highlight coverage of the Watergate affair.
wendy,Shoot.
ben,What's for dessert?
elena,See for yourself.
ben,"No advice from the experts, huh?"
elena,Don't start.
ben,You think I --
elena,I have no idea.
ben,What's on your mind? Don't --
elena,"It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup."
ben,What do you mean?
elena,Don't be dim.
ben,"Elena, what are you're talking about?"
elena,I'm not surprised.
ben,"Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --"
elena,Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
ben, Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
elena,It's a starting place.
ben,"Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?"
ben,"What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here."
ben," Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean."
wendy, Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
wendy," Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know."
elena,"Oh, damn. Uh, I've left the --"
george,"Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?"
ben,"Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey."
george,"Yeah, good."
ben,"Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?"
george, In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.
ben," Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?"
gorman, Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.
gorman,"Don't fret, Benjie, it's --"
paul,"Libbets Casey, please."
doorman,Your name?
paul,Paul Hood.
doorman, Elevator on the right. Eighth floor -- she's waiting for you.
paul, We?
francis," You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff."
paul, Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
francis, Moisture! Moisture!
libbets, Beer. In the pantry.
libbets,Frankie opens them with his teeth.
francis,Hell on the fillings.
wendy,Ouch!
philip,Forgive me.
ted franklin, I hope those weren't my keys.
paul,"Valium. Seconal. Uh,  Francis Chamberlain Davenport the Fourth -- tonight you sleep the sleep of the just."
libbets, No candy for me?
paul," Libbets, you really shouldn't mix and match, you know with the beer. I'll put 'em back."
boland, I wish some of the gang had brought their daughters!
libbets," Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted."
ben, Ready to go?
elena,We're not going anywhere.
paul," Charles, what time is it?"
the group," Hey hey Ben, hang on there a sec."
dot,"Right down the hall, Ben."
ben," Sorry, I'm sorry. Uh, I'll be back."
rob halford," Actually, we didn't put our keys in at all. But you won't spread it around? It's my party, and Dot isn't... hey, we're just going to slip upstairs for a while. You folks like a cup of coffee or something before we go?"
elena,Yeah. You?
paul,Oh shit!
wendy, Get 'em off.
