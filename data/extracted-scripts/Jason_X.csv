Speaker,Dialogue
female voice,Careful . . .
male voice,I know.
adrienne, You thinking what I'm thinking?
adrienne, What about Kkinsa?
stoney,It's over between us. You're the only one for me!
stoney,You okay?
fat lou, Let's go! Time to load up!
yllo, I'm missing two!
fat lou,Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
boeman, North three clicks.
boeman, There!
kicker,"Yo, Teach, what the fuck?"
yllo,We're missing two of the kids!
kicker,Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out.
yllo,Not without me!
yllo,"Amazing! But, how . . I've been coming here for ten years. We never picked this up on our . . . KAY-EM?"
thorgan,Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
kicker,"All right, all right, enough with the history lesson. Lets find these two quick . . so I can kick some little punk ass."
kkinsa,"I have an idea, why don't you go find them and we'll get the hell out of here!"
delongpree,"Thorgan, have you been screwing with . . ."
thorgan,"Cool! This is an automatic ""A""."
kicker,Back to the shuttle! All of you! I'll find them.
yllo,"Relax, Soldier boy, this is amazing. These remains are two hundred years old."
boeman,Creepy.
thorgan,Cool.
kkinsa,"Okay, I'm outta here."
yylo,"Kay-Em, any thoughts?"
thorgan,I'm trying to give her some personality.
yllo,Well stop messing with her. I don't want a science droid with a personality. Now let's find them and get back. I want to get clearance to stay back and study this . . .
kkinsa,No way! I'm not staying here any longer . . . I have a life you know.
yllo, Adrienne! Stoney!
boeman,There was a hall of a battle down here.
computer voice,Dan-danger. Do not enter-er.
kkinsa,I feel compelled to ask why we are ignoring that.
delongpree,Damnit!
yllo,What the hell are you two doing?!
kkinsa,"You're toast, mister."
yllo,You're both toast!
adrienne,You gotta see this!
thorgan," That's a strange design, don't you think?"
kicker,We don't have time for this shit.
delongpree,"Yeah, so? I had Cryo 101 last year."
adrienne,Check it out.
kkinsa,So don't open the door.
adrienne,"Look beyond it, yesterday's news."
yllo,Is that?
yllo," Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!"
kicker,Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
yllo,This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
yllo,"Okay, no screwing around. This is the real thing. Do exactly what I say. Okay Thorgan, open it up."
kkinsa,You're opening the door? What about the . . . ?
delongpree,I'm thinking we should call in some experts.
yllo,This is your find people. You want to give your credit away?
delongpree,I was just saying . . .
thorgan,"The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back."
delongpree,Knock you on your ass pal.
yllo,Kay-Em!
delongpree,I speak on behalf of the group when I say . . . that's fucked.
yllo,Thorgan?!!!
thorgan,Sorry. I'll fix her when we get back.
kkinsa,What's going on?
delongpree,She's dying.
janessa,Bitch looks dead to me.
yllo,"Janessa, stretcher.  Keep your shirt on, sergeant. We have a medical emergency here not tot mention the discovery of a lifetime."
kicker,We're outta here!
yllo,"Fine, grab that end."
thorgan,Hey check this out!
thorgan,This caused the leak and there's an occupant.
kicker,Don't touch that!
kkinsa,"This is bad, no?"
thorgan,"Relax, it's only a  glitch in the system."
janessa,First field trip and you think you're a Scientist. Move out of the way geek.
delongpree,"Jesus, used to make the suckers big didn't they?"
yllo,"My God, look at him. Why would they freeze a dead body?  Alright, load him up, and let's get out of here!"
boeman,"Er, guy? I'm picking up some movement."
azrael,Cool . . . check out my arm.
yllo,Kicker!
kicker,Defense droids. I'm on it.
kkinsa,There goes prom night.
kicker,They're only class two. I can handle this. No problem.
azrael,Not a problem?!
azrael,"I'm missing a fucking arm heeeerrrr-  Oh, that's dreamy."
janessa,"Okay rent-a-cop, do your shit. I gotta date tonight."
kicker,Stand back!
yllo,We have to get these two back in one piece!
yllo,Kicker! Do something!
adrienne,Oh Gawd! I wish it would stop doing that.
azrael, That is soooo cool!
kicker,Come on!
kkinsa,Have I told you guys how much I hate this class?
kicker,"We need another exit! I'll hold 'em off! Teach, find a way out!"
boeman,I'm on it!
kicker,"Sorry kid, leave this to the pros."
boeman, Left at the end of the hall!
thorgan, They're not after us. Their sensors are locked in on . . . him!
kicker,Leave him behind!
yllo,No! He's coming with us!
boeman,Here. We're one meter from the surface!
kicker,Then duck.
delongpree,It's too high!
kicker,Make it happen!
janessa,They're just subclass B droids. I'm so not impressed.
boeman,"Stoney, you catch."
boeman,We're clear! Let's go!
kicker,They've got me! Let go!
boeman,No!
boeman,That wasn't so bad.
kicker, This will be!
thorgan,Nice touch.
boeman,And you said high school was boring.
fat lou,Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
yllo,Just get us to the ship!
azrael,Oh shit I forgot my arm!
adrienne,Here. Dumbass.
fat lou,This is Beowulf approaching from sector fifteen.
brodski,What the hell were you thinking?
yllo,Get them in the lab!
brodski,Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
yllo, Back off!
yllo, Get them to the labs . . . Now!
yllo,What the hell are you doing?
brodski,"My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . ."
yllo,I am an expert!
brodski,You're a teacher.
yllo,"Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!"
brodski,What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
thorgan,Sorry . . . I'll fix her . . . I promise.
brodski,How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
yllo,"Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her."
brodski,"Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it."
yllo,I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
brodski,I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
yllo,I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
brodski,"Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -"
brodski,Jesus what the hell is that?
yllo,"That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with."
azrael,"Watch it punk, I'm armed."
dallas,Punk?
azrael,You'll pay for that.
bernie,Gravitation nominal. Thrusters engaged.
fat lou," Grendel to Grendel's mother, we are enroute."
yllo,Get her prepped for the soup.  Take the other one to lab two.
adrienne,"Yllo, this is my find. My project. I want to be in here."
yllo,"I know, dear, but this is too big a discovery. I need you to prep the second body."
adrienne,"But, I want . . ."
yllo,This is a discovery that we will all share. We have to work as  a team. Now go. Stoney go with her.
thorgan,Have I told you guys how much I love this class?
delongpree,She's beautiful . . .
thorgan,Damn! Talk about your hard nipples.
adrienne,Fucking Yllo! Thinks he can push me aside. This is my find!
stoney,"You know even though we both found this guy , I'll let you take the credits. You can take it from here."
adrienne,Oh thanks . . . fine go. It's just another dissection. You'll only get in my way.
stoney,"Cool. Besides, you're into this shit."
yllo,Hands on training is rare. You should consider yourself lucky.
azrael,Lucky?!
azrael,Another hour and I'd have lost the arm.
janessa,"Oh, was that the hand you beat off with?"
azrael,I better get extra credit for this shit.
yllo,"Delongpree, Status. How you doing?"
delongpree, I'm Okay.
stoney,Well she's definitely a blond.
janessa,Oh that's scientific.
delongpree,You think all girls from the past looked this good?
janessa,She's not that great.
thorgan,400 years . . . I bet she'll be horny.
yllo,"Okay, people, we need to Learn everything there is to learn about our two guests. And if all goes well, I'll mention each one of you when I make my nobel prize speech."
delongpree," Yeah, right."
thorgan,Everything looks good.
yllo,Turn up the heat.
adrienne,Done. Crystallization remains seventeen percent.
computer voice,Crystallization at sixty percent Subject classification . . . deformity.
adrienne,Put it on the screen.
janessa,It's just like Thorgan's. What do you think this means?
thorgan,This is what it means right here.
janessa,Small brains make your balls itch?
delongpre,And what's with the headgear?
boeman,Hockey.
yllo,What do you expect from a culture that sucked its planet dry of resources.
kkinsa,This bores me.
delongpre,She's red. Body temp 98.6. This is so cool.
yllo,Prep defib and start the cell reconstruction.
thorgan,Cool!
yllo,Is she stable?
delongpre,Now what?
yllo,We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
azrael,Don't I deserve a sick day or some shit like that?
kkinsa,Adrienne?! Of all people!
stoney,You're jealous.
kkinsa,Adrienne?!
stoney,It's over between us. You're the one I want.
kkinsa,Bed!
adrienne,Okay big boy . . .
adrienne, . . . let's see what you're made of.
janessa,"All this science shit, makes me horny.  Take off your cloths, we don't have much time."
janessa,You're quicker than usual.
yllo,Later.
janessa,You prefer an apple?
yllo," Secure line. Perez, Joshua, Solaras Space Lab. Connect."
perez,"You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?"
yllo,We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
yllo,I'm sending you the files.
perez," Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . ."
yllo,Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
perez, No way . . . is this a joke?
yllo,"Hypothetically, how much are we talking?"
yllo,I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
kkinsa,How bad do you want it?
adrienne,Interesting. Record. Thawing has caused possible muscle spasms.
kkinsa,Yes . . . yes . . . that's it!
thorgan,Anybody seen the reticulator?
delongpre,"Try next door, there was one there yesterday."
thorgan,Wakey wakey love birds . . . Yllo's gonna be pissed if he catches you fooling around instead of working.
thorgan,"Bye, lovebirds . . . Stoney, you dog."
yllo,"All right, lets do this. Thorgan begin the Defib program, Delongpre, ready the drainage units. Boerman get the others in here."
kkinsa,"No shit, we've got a heart beat!"
stoney,Hell yeah I'm coming!
kkinsa,No . . . not yet!
stoney,YES !!!
kkinsa,NO!!! NO!!! NO!!! YES!!!
stoney,YES!!!!!!
yllo,It's time.
delongpre,What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
yllo,I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
yllo,What the hell are you doing?
brodski,My job.
yllo,"Fine, just stay out of my way.  Hit it."
girl's voice,Mom! Dad! It's loose! He's loose!
rizzo,Help me! Anyone! Somebody help me!
rizzo,You son of a bitch!
computer voice,Cryo-Unit activated.
computer voice,Cryo-Unit leak. Lock down in progress. Security measures on line.
rizzo,Nooooooo!
rizzo,Somebody! No!
computer voice,Subject in computer unit has reached full incubation.
rizzo,No . . .
thorgan,That one did it!
yllo,We should expect a moment of disorientation.
delongpre,Spunky . . .
yllo,She broke my fucking nose!
brodski,I like her already.
rizzo,Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
yllo, Obviously so.
rizzo,What the hell is this shit?
rizzo,"How did I get here, how did you bring me back?"
yllo,Nanotechnology.
rizzo,Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
yllo,We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
rizzo,30? How long was I out?
yllo,The year is 2455. You've been frozen for the past four hundred years.
yllo,Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
rizzo,JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
thorgan,The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
rizzo,Hockey player? He's not a ...
thorgan,He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
rizzo,Old Earth?
yllo,We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
rizzo,But...I...400 years?
yllo,"That's right, now if you could..."
delongpre,It can wait. Let's get you cleaned up.
yllo,Wait a minute...I need...
brodski,Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
delongpre,Come on.
rizzo,Yeah?
delongpre,"I thought that after 400 hundred years, you just might have a little bit of an appetite."
delongpre,"You're on Grendel, a class IV Catamaran transport. It's basically a school bus. We're on our way back to Earth II. It's finals week."
rizzo,You're telling me I'm a friggen class project?
delongpre," Sort of. I mean, no, not really ..."
delongpre,I'll give you a moment alone. Do you want me to come get you when we start the dissection?
yllo,Well?
delongpre,She needs a little time.
yllo,"More time...shit, she's had 400 years..."
delongpre,That's really funny.
yllo,"I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women."
delongpre,"Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?"
rizzo,Jason? He's on this ship?!
yllo,"Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity."
rizzo, Are you finished?
yllo,God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
delongpre,Oh I like her a lot.
brodski,I'm with you kid.
rizzo,Where is he?
brodski," Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead."
rizzo,"No, you're dead! You're all dead!"
yllo,Jesus!
janessa,Oh my God! Adrienne?
thorgan,What have you done?
rizzo,What have I done?! Idiots.
boeman, Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
delongpre,"Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?"
rizzo,"I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves."
janessa,Maybe she tripped.
brodski,"Jesus, God!"
kicker,"Oh man, what the hell happened?"
rizzo,Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
yllo,Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
rizzo,I didn't say he was alive.
dallas,"That's nine to four, geek-boy."
azrael,You got lucky.
dallas,You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
azrael,"Speaking of which, duck!"
azrael,What the?!
dallas,He's good.
dallas,That sucks. Why won't he go down?
azrael,Pause play.
dallas,He's not part of the program.
azrael,Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
azrael,Hey! We're playing a game here. Get off the court!
dallas,"No, we're playing a game...not you numbnuts..."
azrael,Asshole that does not count as a kill.
dallas,Yes it does.
azrael,"Oh, come on!"
dallas,"Okay, enough of this shit."
azrael,"Alright, asshole."
dallas,"I don't have all day, kid."
azrael,"Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on."
azrael, Lab...this is AZ in the game grid. Your guy got out and runined our game.
yllo,Azrael can you repeat that?
rizzo,Get him out of there!
azrael, I said the guy in the mask is in here ruining our game.
azrael, Send someone to the grid to pick him up. He looks lost.
yllo,That's impossible.
rizzo,I told you! Get them out of there!  Get out of there! Get out of there now!
azrael," All right fine, we'll head back--"
dallas,Jesus!
brodski,Dallas! That you? Come back!
dallas, Sarge! Get the fuck down here! We got a real shitstorm in the --
brodski, Dallas?! Dallas?! Do you copy?
rizzo,He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
brodski,"Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!"
delongpre,Where are you going?
rizzo,We have to get off this ship.
yllo,That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
rizzo,Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
brodski,I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
rizzo,"Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live."
delongpre,"You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to."
rizzo,I hope so.
kicker,Damn. Are they playing?
sven,Dallas?! Azrael!
sven,Oh shit.
sven,"Sarge, this is bad. The kid's His guts are ripped out."
brodski, Dead?
sven,Oh yeah.
brodski,Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
kicker,Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
sven,Sorry!
kicker,Don't friggen do that!
brodski,"Yllo, what's your head count?"
yllo,Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
janessa,"You know, Stoney's done everyone on this trip but me..what's up with that?"
brodski,This place should be safe. Get them back here. I don't want to be hunting around and kill one of your kids by accident. As much as I've dreamed of doing that.
brodski,I need to know what you know about this guy.
rizzo,Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
brodski,Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
brodski,I've been a grunt for fifteen years. There's not a problem I can't fix with enough ammunition.
yllo,"Stoney! Stoney if you can hear me, get your ass down to the lab immediately!  I'm going to see if I can find them."
kkinsa,Sstoney's dead!
yllo,"ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends."
brodski,Not a chance.
yllo,JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
brodski,You got that right.
yllo,"This thing could be worth a great deal.... scientifically...not to mention what the fat cats on Earth II would pay for it! Look, I'll split it with"
brodski,"You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!"
kicker,Fuckin A...
brodski,Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do!
yllo,That bastard! Boemen turn on the tracking monitors.
rizzo,Robot huh?
rizzo,Barbie from hell...
rizzo,"Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie..."
rizzo,I'm surrounded by idiots.
thorgon,"Sorry, I'm working on it."
delongpre,Are all twenty-first century girls like you?
rizzo,"He'll kill us all. You know that, don't you?"
thorgon, There's been an unauthorized entrance to the Cargo Bay.
brodski,Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
yllo, At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
brodski,"Alright, the teach requests we take this guy out at the knees. I say shoot to kill."
brodski,"So after you've killed him, put one in his knee so we can say we tried."
brodski,"Go to infrared, stay in radio contact.  Teach you there?"
yllo,"Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though."
yllo,Yeah yeah. Got it.
brodski,Let's move out.
brodski,"Two teams, Port, starboard."
thorgan,"Each blip represents a trained killer. It's men like that fought off the pirates on Earth II, battled Jauntuns on the solar moons..."
rizzo,"So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?"
thorgan,Exactly.
rizzo,WHAT'S IT MEAN WHEN ONE OF YOUR BLIPS DISAPPEARS?
boeman," Sergeant, this is Boemen..."
brodski,"Briggs, Geko, talk to me!"
briggs,He was...he was right here!
brodski,DAMNIT to hell! We're coming to you!
thorgan,You see that?
boeman,"Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage."
briggs,Got it.
briggs,I don't see anything.
briggs,That's GEKO. mAYBE you kids should stay out of this.
thorgan," Jesus, is this what it was like on your..."
boeman,"Sergeant, you've lost two more men!"
kicker,"Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?"
brodski,Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
yllo,"Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab."
yllo,We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
yllo,Thank you.
yllo," Ok Sarge, what's your status?"
yllo,But I didn't see...
thorgan,Yes!
rizzo,"Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing."
boeman,Duck fuckers?
rizzo,"He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here."
delongpre,Outta here?
rizzo,Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
thorgon,There's a shuttle.
rizzo,"Alright, been nice knowing you. Who's with me?"
kkinsa,I'll go.
boemen,Yllo said stay here.
kkinsa,Fuck Yllo!
boemen,They got him! You're not leaving!
sven,Big sucker too.
brodski,Kicker? Where are you?
rizzo,Do something!!!
thorgon,Don't look at me! I'm in high school!
brodski,Find Crutch! Set up an ion field around the cargo bay. We'll torch the sucker! Yllo...you're a dead man!
yllo,Sergeant!
brodski, What?
rizzo,"Lesson number one, kiddies. You wanna get home safely then we get off this boat."
kkinsa,I don't understand...what does he want?
rizzo,He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
rizzo,Any questions?
yllo,You're not going anywhere.
rizzo,You wanna die?
yllo, Are we locked down?
boeman,That door's the only way in or out and it won't open without the code.
yllo,Then we wait. We're docking with Space Lab in less than an hour.
rizzo,What good will that do?
yllo,They can deal with this sort of thing.
rizzo,More soldiers?
yllo,Scientists. Very intellegent men.
rizzo,That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's ass at a spelling bee!
janessa,"Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?"
yllo,"Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!"
rizzo," Guys, please come with me!"
yllo,4You're not going anywhere.
delongpre,Now hold on! We should hear her out!
thorgan,She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
yllo,Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
delongpre,No shit. I got no problem with that.
thorgan,Maybe if we knew a little bit more about what we're delaing with here...
rizzo,tNighty-night.
crutch,Leave her be.
rizzo,"Ok, who do I gotta fuck to get off this boat?"
rizzo,Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
thorgan,"Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there."
rizzo,How do you open the damn door?
yllo,You're crazy!
delongpre,"Rizzo, he's out there."
rizzo,Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
rizzo,Fine. Bye.
yllo, Pack your shit. We'll disembark in an hour. The guys at Space Lab have the necessary equipment to contain this thing and then we can study it.
yllo,Computer on line.
yllo, Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
computer voice,Power to Beowulf disengaged.
yllo, She's too valuable. She's not leaving this ship.
fat lou,Disengage auto-pilot.
bernie,Disengaged.
fat lou,"New COURSE, seven-eighty-one."
bernie,"On course. ETA 36 minutes, 34 seconds."
fat lou,Engage auto pilot.
bernie,En-en-en-en...Eta-Eta...
rizzo,Which way?
kkinsa,What?
rizzo,Ssh.
rizzo,He's in here.
rizzo,You scream I'll snap your neck. Got it?
kkinsa, How do you know?
rizzo, I just know.
yllo,We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
delongpre,I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
yllo,"Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?"
delongpre,"Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe."
yllo,They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the  shuttle.
rizzo,Open the doors.
kkinsa,Something's wrong.
rizzo,Keep trying!
yllo,Everyone ready?
yllo,"Fat Lou, what's the ETA?"
yllo,"Lou, goddamjnit! Bernie, where's Lou?!"
thorgan,Yuck.
delongpre,We're screwed.
yllo,The ship doesn't need pilots to dock. We'll disembark and you'll see. Everything will be fine.
boeman,Uh...that's gonna be a problem. The ship's not on auto-pilot. We're flying blind.  Thirty minutes till impact.
yllo,I guess...we'll have to go to the bridge.
thorgan,But...
rizzo,"Damnit, he's got them."
kkinsa,"Rizzo, I think Yllo must have done something. The door won't open."
yllo,It's alright. He can't get in here!
kkinsa,The power's back up!
rizzo,Then open the doors!
kkinsa,Thirty seconds.
janessa,What do we do?!!
yllo,Crutch?
crutch,Help me up.
janessa,"Okay, I'm guessing you should hurry."
thorgan,"Jesus, tell this asshole I don't play hockey!"
crutch,Okay!
yllo,Will that take us to the bridge?
crutch,"It's a maze up there, but yes."
yllo,We'll engage auto-pilot! Everything'll be fine!
yllo,Move it people!
boeman,Help me!
yllo,"Now hold on! Have you considered how valuable you are? Credit, fame, you can have it all. And ladies. I mean, how long has it been?"
yllo, That's all you wanted?
rizzo, Three...two...one...
delongpre,"GO, GO, GO!"
kkinsa,"Rizzo, come on!"
rizzo,Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
kkinsa, What?!!
rizzo,I gotta go back.
kkinsa,But?!!
crutch,"Okay, we need to ..."
boeman,"You forgot didn't you, you old fart?"
delongpre,Shit! Move it! He's coming!
delongpre,Go!
delongpre,Faster!
delongpre,FASTER!!!
delongpre,He's right on my ass!
janessa,That was fun.
janessa,Thorgan?!
thorgan,I didn't do it. The fall scattered her programming..wait. Where's? Shit!
thorgan,"Hey, I think the fall killed him."
rizzo,"Trust me, it's temporary."
boeman,Better let me.
thorgan,Where'd you get the gun?
crutch,The bridge is this way!
rizzo,Wait!
rizzo,"Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!"
boeman," What do you mean, not enough time?"
janessa,I think your metal lover's losing it.
delongpre,"Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes."
rizzo,Guys!!! The shuttle?
rizzo,Idiots.
crutch,This way!
thorgan,I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
delongpre,Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
crutch, Just around this bend...
boeman,Nooooo!
boeman,You'll hit crutch!
rizzo,What are you doing? You can't save him!
rizzo,Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
delongpre, No you don't!
rizzo,Don't stop!
rizzo,You never stop when he's down!
rizzo,Shit!!!!
crutch, Forget him. Come on.
boeman,Uh-oh.
janessa,What?!
boeman,Kkinsa! Open the doors!
delongpre,"Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!"
rizzo,"Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work."
delongpre,Med-kit?
rizzo,I guessed.
boeman,Kkinsa! No!!!
rizzo,DON'T WASTE YOUR AMMO!
thorgan,Did we get him?
delongpre,We're screwed!
rizzo,400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
rizzo,"Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks."
boeman,We're not leaving Crutch!
rizzo,We don't have time to argue!
janessa,"Okay, tell you what. You die, we'll run."
computer voice,Collision eminent.
boeman,Everyone okay?
thorgan,I think I broke my arm.
janessa,You geeks wanna gimmie a hand?
delongpre, We lost crutch.
boeman,Goodbye old friend.
rizzo,"Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out."
boeman, Could you show a little compassion?!
rizzo,"Look, I'm sorry. I really am, but aren't you forgetting about ..."
delongpre,Back to the labs!
computer voice,Dam-damage port side 59 percent. Decompression 40 percent. Gravity-y rotors failing.
thorgan,Oh shit.
janessa,This is just great.
thorgan,"This is crazy, we can't do anything like this!"
thorgan,Grab my hand!
janessa,"Boeman, can you reach DeLongpre? We'll push you in."
delongpre,Hey! That hurts.
delongpre, Push off toward us.
janessa,"Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there."
thorgan,I'm gonna spew.
janessa,That ought'a help the situation.
delongpre,Do it Rizzo! We'll catch you.
rizzo,What if you miss?
delongpre,What if we don't?
delongpre,He's coming right at you!
boeman, Grab my feet!
janessa,Okay that hurt.
boeman,"Thorgan, pull us in."
thorgan,What now?
janessa,Shit. He's gonna send himself right at us.
computer voice,System repair activated. Back up power on line.
janessa, Get off of me!
thorgan," Yeah, I guess not."
janessa,Let's just get out of here.
boeman,The ship's in bad shape. Back to the labs. Let's check out status.
boeman,Shit!
thorgan,The hull's imploding!
boeman,Rizzo! Can you hear me?!
rizzo,Yeah. Are you guys okay?
boeman,There's a red lever on the wall beside you. Pull it!
rizzo,It's locked!
boeman,"Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!"
boeman,Hurry Rizzo! You have to reverse the pressurization.
boeman,What are you doing?!!
rizzo,"If the ship goes, so does Jaso."
boeman,Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
rizzo,No.
delongpre,Rizzo?!
rizzo,It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
thorgan,Hurry! She's lost it!
janessa,So what else is new?
rizzo,Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
janessa,Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
computer voice,Depressurization inconclusive.
janessa, You happy? You've killed us all!
janessa,What's the point?
delongpre,So that's it then.
rizzo,What's that?
boeman,THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
rizzo,Are there any other shuttles?
janessa,No.
rizzo,Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
thorgan,You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
janessa,"A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?"
thorgan,Am I in there?
rizzo,Hey.
delongpre,"That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good."
rizzo,Hey!!
rizzo,What's this?
delongpre,"It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom."
rizzo,Can we get through these?
thorgan,Sure but what good will that do?
boeman,"When the left hull goes, so will the right."
rizzo,What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
janessa,"You know, Yllo seemed to think we could catch this guy alive, well, he'd be worth millions."
rizzo,Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
janessa,I'm just saying.
rizzo," Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?"
delongpre,We'd need charges.
boeman,We could convert fission transistors.
thorgan,We're not supposed to do that.
boeman,"What are you gonna do, tell me?"
delongpre,The engine room will have molecular welders. We could seal up the hull.
janessa,"YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job."
thorgan,Would you?
delongpre,Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
rizzo,You got a better plan?
boeman,I'll need system four converters.
thorgan,They're back here.
delongpre,How many?
boeman,Bring 'em all. Let's move!
thorgan,Hey! I'm not ready.
boeman,"Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there."
janessa,You're so bossy.
thorgan,You're leaving me here alone?
delongpre,Don't blow your foot off.
thorgan,"Come here, might as well fix that arm."
delongpre,See anything?
delongpre,I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
boeman, Thorgan? You coming?!
thorgan, Almost done.
thorgan,"Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming."
delongpre,Put your finger here.
delongpre,My father wanted me to be a businessman.
delongpre,That's why I'm here.
rizzo,"So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up."
delongpre,"My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change."
rizzo,I thought you meant...
delongpre,"You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh? You must have been a very lonely girl."
thorgan,"Sorry, sorry."
thorgan,Good point.
janessa,"Thorgan, you little shit, is that you?"
rizzo,"When I was four, the ocean quit producing life. Too many pollutants. Nuclear testing, the occasional terrorist bombing...the atmosphere was shit by the time I was eight. We moved underground when I was twelve."
delongpre,Were you close to your father?
delongpre, It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
delongpre,"Sorry, you were saying?"
delongpre,And what happend to ...?
rizzo,I couldn't save them.
delongpre,"Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?"
delongpre,It's true.  You caused enough stink that we were at least a little cautious. Of course this is the first field trip I went on that had a body count.
delongpre,"I'm not much, but I promise, I won't let this guy get you."
brodski,Where is everybody? What happened?
janessa,Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
brodski,Give me a break! What happened?
janessa,Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
brodski,Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
janessa,Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
brodski,Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
brodski,"Yup, that ought'a do it."
janessa,Well go on! Pass out!
janessa,Shit.
brodski, He-help me...
delongpre,We're blowing three. Hang on.
boeman,"Janessa, we're on our way to you!"
boeman,Where is...?
delongpre,You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
boeman,Where have you been?!!
janessa,He....He...
delongpre,He's coming!!!
boeman,Run!!
rizzo,We can't lead him into the other hull!
boeman,We don't have a choice!
thorgan,"Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass."
delongpre,Holy shit!
boeman,What are we waiting for?!! Come on!!
boeman, Where the hell were you?!!
janessa,"He came for me, I had to run!"
thorgan," Kay-Em, you okay?"
boeman,Toss me a chip.
boeman,"Thorgan, you're brilliant. Have I told you that lately?"
thorgan, See you around.
boeman,I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
delongpre,Then stop talking and work faster!
boeman,"Okay, Janessa, give me your last charge."
janessa,I...I don't know what I did...
delongpre,You lost the charge?
janessa,He was chasing me!
rizzo,Can we blow it with just two?
boeman,If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
delongpre,Then what do we do?!
boeman,I don't know!
delongpre,"Well, it was a good plan."
brodski,"Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!"
boeman,Sergeant? We thought you were...
brodski,"Yeah, yeah.  Well, what have you got to say for yourself?"
janessa,I don't know...sorry?
rizzo,"Sergeant, we could use a big bomb."
brodski,Bomb?
boeman,Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
brodski,How much you need?
brodski,Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
boeman,Rizzo did.
thorgan,Kay-Em!
boeman,What are you doing back?!!
rizzo,You killed him?
thorgan,"You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you."
rizzo,His mother?
boeman,What?
rizzo,I don't know. Nothing.
boeman,Hurry up people! We're running out of time.
thorgan,As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
boeman,Two more charges to go.
thorgan,Done!
boeman,Let's move out!
brodski,"Kid, you ever thought about the marine corp?"
delongpre,I need another minute. Come on!
brodski,Well fuck me.
thorgan,Kay-Em? Re-engage killer instinct.
boeman,Shit!
thorgan,Kay-Em!!!
boeman,Done!!
boeman,RUN!!
thorgan,Kay-Em! Get away!
delongpre,Done!
delongpre,"Shit, hurry!"
boeman,What...?
boeman,What are you doing?!!
rizzo, Go!
rizzo,"Oh, yeah, you remember me."
boeman,Hurry!
delongpre,Faster! Don't we have another gun?
janessa,They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
delongpre,They'll make it.
janessa,Close the fucking door!
delongpre,NO!
delongpre,Damnit!
delongpre, Forget it. I had to rewire it. Once it's started it won't stop.
delongpre,Get ready to blow it.
delongpre,Now!
brodski,Damage?
boeman,Minimal.
rizzo,We made it?
delongpre,I think...I think maybe we did.
thorgan,Kay-Em we made it!
boeman,I've changed the course for Earth II. And I sent a distress signal.
boeman," Our ship has been damaged, most of the crew dead. We need evac."
voice,Copy that Grendel. Rescue enroute. You should hit EARTH II orbit in fifteen minutes. Rescue ETA twenty minutes.
boeman,We're going home people.
delongpre, See? We're not so bad.
rizzo,Not so bad.
boeman,This way!
boeman,The pressures cause the engines to overheat! Hurry!
janessa,Pull me in!
brodski,"I'm pulling, damnit!"
brodski,"Well, that's a shame."
brodski,We need weapons.
rizzo,Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
delongpre,It bought us some time.
boeman,And now we're all out of it.
boeman,"The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done."
rizzo,Done?
thorgan,Kaboom.
delongpre,Again?! Jesus!
rizzo,Why am I not surprised?
delongpre,Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
brodski,Can't shut em' down from here.
boeman,Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
delongpre,You ain't catching my ass in there again.
brodski,I'll go.
boeman,You're too weak. I'll go.
rizzo,"You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it."
delongpre,You?
rizzo, I'll need a distraction.
thorgan,What kind of a distraction?
then,RIZZO HEY!
rizzo,You want some of me?
rizzo,"Come on, keep up."
rizzo,You want some of me or not?
rizzo,Take your best shot --
rizzo, I'm melting! I'm melting!
rizzo,"See now that was stupid. Persistent, yes, but stupid."
rizzo,"Not this time, asshole. This time I'm gonna watch you burn in hell."
rizzo,Make it fast. He's coming.
delongpre,Almost got it.
rizzo,Delongpre! Out of time!
delonpre,Got it!
delongpre,Damn that was close!
rizzo," Guys, he's right behind us!"
delongpre,Okay?!!
boeman, The docking bay was damaged after the explosion. Meet us at the airlock.
delongpre,Got it.  You ever space walked?
rizzo,"Oh sure, all the time."
rizzo, I hate the future!
thorgan,Don't worry. He can't see us.
rizzo,Is that...?
delongpre,Earth II.
delongpre,I'll help you in.
thorgan," Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?"
delongpre,"I knew you were a little sick, but Geez."
thorgan," Goodbye, my love."
thorgan, This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program?
rizzo,His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
delongpre,That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
rizzo,Eat me.
woman,Help me!  Jason help me!
delongpre,"Well, do something!"
thorgan,Shit!
boeman,Just a little more time.
rizzo,Thorgan!!!!
rizzo,He saved our lives.
delongpre,"Boeman, the ships not here."
brodski,Yeee---Haaaaa!!
