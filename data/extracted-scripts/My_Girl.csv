vada,"All right, follow me and don't say a word."
vada,Okay. Lean forward.
boy,I want my money back!
vada,I was afraid of this.
vada,"Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy."
vada,I bet she's roaming around this house somewhere.
vada,Hi Grammoo.
harry, Vada would you bring down my cigarettes?
vada,Seeya later. 
harry,"Did I tell you, he was my woodshop teacher."
arthur,You took woodshop?
harry,"Yeah, I made a tie rack."
arthur,I made a tie rack.
vada,Ahem.
harry,"Vada, just put 'em on the stool."
vada,Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
harry," Ya, that rack holds six ties."
arthur,I still have mine.
vada,Arthur!!
arthur,Vada!!
vada,I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
arthur,Good for you baby.

shelly,"Excuse me, what about the job?"
harry,Pardon?
shelly,I need the job.
harry,"Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh..."
shelly,"Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common."
harry,You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
shelly,"Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal."
harry,"Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the...."

nurse randall,"Okay, he'll see you, why don't you go in?"
vada,"Well, what is it? I can handle it."
dr welty,You are perfectly healthy.
vada,"That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms."
dr welty,"Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?"
vada,Yes.
dr welty,"Vada you've gotta stop this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you!"
vada,I'll just have to get a second opinion.
vada,The whole medical profession is a crack.
vada,Hey look!
vada,"That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him."
vada,Hi Mr. Bixler!
vada,"It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading."
vada,"Yes, and now I'm reading War & Peace for fun."
vada,"Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?"
vada,This is one big house for one single person.
vada,How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
vada,How much does it cost?
vada,What do you get for that?
vada,"No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War & Peace."
vada,"No, I'm going home."
vada,Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
shelly,"Excuse me Harry, I finished Mr. Layton's hair. He kinda looked......  Harry, what's wrong with her??"
harry,"Oh, she's just pretending. Vada, get up here and eat your broccoli!"
vada, I think it's my prostate.
grammoo,"I got rhythm, I got music, I got my man who could ask for anything more? I got daisies, in green pastures, I got my man, who could ask for anything more?"
shelly,Who's winning?
vada,I am.
vada,He is not my boyfriend!
vada,Do you think I kissed that ugly old thing?
judy,Maybe you can come some time.
shelly,"You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you."
vada,I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
shelly, Want a piece of chocolate?
shelly,Thomas J?
shelly,To chocolate?
vada,He's allergic to everything.
shelly,Chocolate?
shelly,"Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing."
vada,"It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in."
vada,It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
shelly,Maybe black means you're happy?
vada,"I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?"
vada,"It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer."
vada,Shut your big fat mouth!
shelly,"I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?"
vada,He won't give it to me.
shelly,Well you don't know that. Ask him.
vada,"Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?"
harry,That's a lot of money for a little girl.
vada,"It's for school, for summer writing class."
harry, Any more soda left?
vada,Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
harry,Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
vada,Dad?
vada,Dad??
harry,What?
vada,The money?
harry,"Ahh, maybe next summer."
vada's thoughts,"He forgot about the time I wanted to be a magician, I was really great at making myself disappear."
vada,Wanna play?
arthur,"No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me."
shelly,Vada? VADA?? What happened??
vada," My ball, I lost my ball."
shelly, Come on sweetie.
shelly,Excuse me Harry?
harry,Uh huh?
shelly,Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
harry,Yeah.
shelly,"Yeah, "
shelly,You don't like it?
harry,"This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker."
shelly," I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry,"
harry,She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
shelly,"I just wanted to get past this ""old school Marm"" image."
harry,That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
shelly,"Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada."
harry,What do you mean??
shelly,Well the other night at dinner...
harry,"Oh that, she just likes to play."
shelly,"I don't think so, I think she's confused about death."
harry,"She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it."
shelly,"Harry, I really think she....."
harry," She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?"
vada,There's Shelly!
shelly,Hi.
vada,Can we look around in your camper?
shelly,Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
shelly,Uh huh.
shelly,Liverpool?
vada,Big Ringo fan.
shelly,"Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?"
vada,I would.
shelly,Thomas?
shelly,"Oh! You shouldn't be looking at that, it's a little too old for you."
vada,Did you read ALL these books?
shelly,Uh huh.
vada,What are they about?
shelly,"Mostly love, and romance."
shelly,They're just fun to read.
vada,Are you married?
shelly,"No, I'm divorced."
vada,Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
shelly,"Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other."
shelly,With bottle of soda in mouth Hmmmph gurgle gurgle...
shelly,"Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place."
shelly,"Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day."
shelly,"Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?"
vada,Can I use your bathroom first?
shelly,Sure.
vada,"You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late."
shelly,Okay.
guy,I got one.
vada, I paid the money.
vada,"Uh huh, I wanna be a writer."
justin,"Hey, I think it's real beautiful. She want's to be a writer."
ronda,"I experienced something with my boyfriend the other day, and I wrote a few words down."
ronda,"He covers me like a blanket, from the cold, dark night, As I look into his eyes, I know it's right, To touch, To feel, I know he's real, Flesh all a mush, Flesh ALL a mush, I can't fight it, There's no point, I wake up in Lighter joint."
vada,I wrote a poem too.
vada,"Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode."
justin,"I hear that Vada, Flesh all a Mush or Rocky Road, it's about desire."
vada's thoughts,My fears and secrets. I'm afraid I killed my mother.
harry," Can not do without, Harry's wild about me."
shelly,"Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up."
harry,"Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh."
shelly,"I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much."
harry,"After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though."
shelly,I'm sure she will.
vada,Maybe they had a big breakfast.
vada,"Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!"
vada,Hurry!
vada,"Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back."
vada,"You're hurting him, don't kill him!!"
vada,Ouch! Darn hook!
vada,"I'm bleeding, did he get away? Go look."
vada,"Hey, we can become blood brothers."
vada,You could pick that scab on your arm.
vada,It'll bleed.
vada,Uh huh.
vada,"Okay, rub them together."
vada,Now we're blood brothers for life.
shelly,Hi.
harry,"Oh Hi, what can I do for you?"
shelly,"Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing."
harry,"Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family."
shelly,"Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society."
harry,I wrote that.
shelly,No kidding?
shelly,"Oh it's good, ""In lieu of"" I love that word lieu."
harry,"I prefer it to ""instead"", it has more dignity."
shelly,"In lieu... ""instead"".... No contest."
harry,It's no big deal.
shelly,"You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, ""Love Story"" at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?"
harry,I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
shelly,"I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in.  I'll let you get back to work."
harry,"I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to."
shelly, Okay.
shelly,Hi Vada.
vada,Are you going out somewhere?
shelly,No.
vada,So how come you're putting lipstick on?
shelly,A girl's always gotta look her best.
vada,"I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color."
shelly,Have you ever tried any?
vada,No.
shelly,"Come here, sit down."
shelly,"Now, first we blot."
shelly,Take a look. I think it looks real nice on you.
vada,"Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?"
shelly,"Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth."
vada,The boys at school don't think I am.
shelly,"They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow."
vada,Do you like putting makeup on people?
shelly,"Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes."
vada,"Shelly, I would definitely hold off on that Hollywood thing."
vada,No.
vada,A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
vada,"Oh, in the garage. Walk me over."
vada,"It's only a garage, come on."
vada,"Hey, one of my streamers is gone! It probably fell off in here."
vada,"That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head."
vada,"Come on, it's fun."
vada,"Hmmmm, interesting."
vada,You have no personality.
vada,Never mind.
vada,Yes.
vada,It's my mother.
vada,No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
vada,What?
vada,"I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last."
vada,"It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud."
phil,"Well well well, what's going on in here?"
harry,"Nothing, I'm dressing."
phil,"Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to lie to your big brother?"
harry,HEY! WATCH THE HAIR!! THIS SHIRT GIVES!!! ALL RIGHT!!!!
phil,"Oh yes, oh that's great."
harry,I'm very nervous.
phil,Why?
harry,The last date I had was twenty years ago.
phil,"That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, ""The Sexual Revolution"", now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!"
harry,Oh come on.
phil,"Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry."
harry,Are you sure about all this?
phil,Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
harry,"Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute."
phil,"Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track."
harry,"No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?"
phil,Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.
harry,Goodnight Vada.
vada,"Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?"
harry,"Ahh, I just wanna look nice."
vada,You never cared before.
harry,"Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together."
vada,Why?
harry,She likes to play bingo.
vada,Can I go too?
harry,"Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company."
vada,Here.
vada,Sorry.
vada,"Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight."
vada,Pacifist!
vada,Bed wetter!
harry,"Don't worry, there's a strategy to bingo. For instance, on a given night anybody can win, but I play the odds, when choosing bingo cards, I use a range of theories from the laws of probability to avoiding duplicate number systems. This way you get much more activity."
shelly, Does it make it easier to win?
harry,"No. Just, more activity."
harry, Hi Carl.
vada,"We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch."
vada,Duck!
shelly, Oh great!
vada,"Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me."
shelly, Aarrggh.
shelly,I just had a terrible thought Harry.
harry,What's that?
shelly,I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
harry,Why d'you think these seats were empty.
vada,Go???
shelly,"Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry."
harry,"Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy"
shelly,Kinda like men.
harry,"Oh, how do you mean?"
shelly,"You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want."
vada, BINGO!
bingo announcer,We have a winner. Will the winner please raise their hand?
carl,"There was no bingo, it came from outside."
vernon,How could someone outside get a bingo?
carl,"Someone outside didn't get a bingo, someone outside yelled bingo you moron!"
vernon,Who are you calling a mowon? 
vernon's wife,Put a lid on it Vernon!
carl,"Put a lid on it?? If you weren't 200 years old, I'd kick your wrinkled ARSE!!"
harry,"Hey fellers fellers, it's just a bingo game."
vada,We can go now.
shelly,I had a good time tonight.
harry,I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
shelly,Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
harry,"Okay, sure."
shelly,Home sweet home.
harry,It's nice.
shelly,I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
harry,Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
shelly,"You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush."
harry,Yeah.
shelly,Are you mad at me?
harry,"No, why?"
shelly,"I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and..."
harry,"Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died."
shelly,What happened to her?
harry,"Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born."
shelly,Did she ever see Vada?
harry,"I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was....."
shelly,Dance with me?
harry,Here?
shelly,This is where we are.
harry,Is there enough room?
harry,I haven't danced in.....
shelly,"In ages, I know, me neither."
harry,Rock?
shelly,"See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good."
harry,"At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue."
shelly,What are you wearing?
harry,"Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic."
shelly,Do you want to?
harry,Want to what?
shelly,Kiss me.
harry,Yes.
shelly,Good.
shelly,"Good at kissing, and dancing, I'm very optimistic."
harry,"I ahh, better go."
shelly,It's only eight o'clock.
harry,Goodnight Shelly.
shelly,Goodnight.
shelly,"Well, I guess it's official we had a date, maybe we can play bingo again sometime."
harry,"I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours."
shelly,Goodnight.
woman,Ooooh that's really cool.
justin,"Okay what we're gonna do is, send our vibes out into the group."
ronda,"Everybody hold hands, and close your eyes. Relax your muscles and take deep breaths."
justin,"Now, try to feel what the other person is feeling, without speaking any words, send out your vibe, and receive the vibes around you at the same time. Can you feel it?"
ronda,"Okay, open your eyes. What did everybody feel?"
guy,I felt Mrs. Hunsaker's strength.
other guy,"I can feel that Ronda is one with the Earth, she's so cosmically in tune."
ronda,"So right on, that's exactly what I sent out, and I felt like, you were full of inner peace and harmony."
vada,I felt Justin's hangnail.
justin,"No Vada, that's not what we're looking for, a hangnail is insignificant. What's in my soul, feel my aura."
vada,I don't think I'm allowed to.
justin,"I tell you what, let's try it again, hold hands."
vada's thoughts,"Grammoo once had a hangnail on her big toe. It got infected and traveled to her vocal chords, it ruined her singing voice, I don't think Grammoo thought it was insignificant."
harry,"Lettuce, watch out for the rust when you get lettuce."
shelly,"Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada."
vada,Hi.
harry,I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
shelly,"Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?"
harry,Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
shelly,It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
harry,I'm looking forward to that.
harry,"HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing."
vada,Sorry.
shelly,You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
harry,Really?
vada," Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?"
harry,"Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today."
vada's thoughts,"I used to like to play with my Ken and Barbie dolls, Ken was my favorite. Then one Christmas I got them a camper, and all they wanted to do was hang out in it by themselves. So I wasn't too upset when they took that wrong turn and went over a cliff."
phil,"Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them."
harry,That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
phil,"No, no no...."
harry,"Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!"
shelly,How's it going chef?
harry,Okay.
vada,Are they ready yet?
harry,"No, sweetie, not yet."
vada,When?
harry,"Soon honey, soon."
vada,When??
harry,"In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out."
shelly,"Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God."
harry,I'll second that.
vada,"Hey Shelly, like seafood?"
shelly,"Uh huh, why?"
vada,See food!
shelly, That's attractive.
shelly, Oh shit! Excuse me...
man,"Hey Shelly, who lives here?  The Addams Family?"
shelly,"Danny, what are you doing here?"
danny,What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
shelly," Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?"
danny,"You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home."
phil,These two people do not have a good relationship.
shelly," No! _I_ bought it, _I_ paid for it..."
shelly,"I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine."
danny,"Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be ""OUR MUTUAL ASSET"", not ""Shelly's recreational vehicle"". Gimme the keys."
shelly,Keep your voice down!
danny,What?
shelly,The boss is watching us...
danny, I'm impressed.
shelly,God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
danny,"Yeah, all right..."
shelly," This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss..."
danny,Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
vada, I like my name.
shelly, We used to be married.
vada, Are you here to take Shelly back?
harry,"Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?"
danny,"Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife....."
shelly,"Ex...ex, ex..."
danny,My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
harry,Shelly?
shelly,"Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise....."
danny,"I don't think so, I got a copy of the property settlement right here."
harry,Danny?
danny,WHAT?
harry,"Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever."
danny, This guy bonking you?
shelly, Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
harry," Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper."
danny,Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
harry,It's her home! It's where she lives!!
danny,"Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,  Gimme the goddam keys."
shelly,Stop it! That hurts!!
harry,Danny.....
ralph,What'd you do that for??
harry,Who are you?
ralph,I'm his brother.
harry,Oh then you'll probably be visiting us here quite often.
ralph,WHY??
harry,"Because if he ever tries to take Shelly's camper again, I'm gonna bury him in my front yard."
phil, Your father is a savage.
shelly,Bye Ralph.
shelly," Well, you were pretty great!"
harry,Is it really your camper?
shelly,Can we see it from the back yard?
harry,You can get the general idea...
harry,"Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year..."
shelly,Pointing upwards Look...
harry,"Did you ahh, love him?"
shelly,I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
vada,"He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life."
phil,He likes her.
vada,Does he love her?
phil,Probably.
vada,Do you like her?
phil,"Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father."
vada,Why?
phil,"After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny."
vada,Really?
phil,"Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry."
vada,My Dad was funny?
phil,"Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh."
vada's thoughts,"My Uncle fought in the Korean war, he had a steel plate put in his head, Daddy said he didn't come back the same, one night, he picked up a radio station from Oklahoma in his teeth, it was really neat."
vada,Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh.
vada, Carnnk yu sheeee ik??
vada,Can't you see it?
dr welty,No.
vada,It's there.
dr welty,Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
vada,"Dr. Welty, are you sure those are yours?"
nurse randall,"So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun."

harry,"I know, I know, let's go on the ""sit on the bench and rest"" ride."
shelly,"I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis."
vada,"Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs."
shelly,"Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine."
shelly,"They were!! ""Popular Mechanics"", no ""Popular Science"". I don't know, popular."
shelly,Oh look they're trying to hit that poor thing.
harry,Watch you don't knock out a fish.

shelly,Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
vada," Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish."

shelly,"It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk."
vada,My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
shelly,"It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada."
vada,I think it should be outlawed.
shelly,"Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently."
vada,"Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys."
vada,I dunno..
vada,NO!
vada,"Grammoo, I'm going to the bathroom, i'll be right back."

harry,Is that the fish you won at the carnival?

harry,"He's getting big.  Vada, come here and sit down for a minute."
harry,"Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive."
vada, I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
vada,Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
harry,"No sweetheart, you can't."
vada, Why not?
harry,He was allergic to bees.
vada, He's okay isn't he?
harry, There were just too many of 'em.
vada,Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
dr welty,"Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?"

rev,Hi Harry.

rev,The Sennetts want to thank you for taking care of things so quickly.
shelly," Vada? I see you took your tray in,"
shelly,She won't come out. It's been a whole day. You have to do something Harry.
harry,The funeral's starting.
shelly,"Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead."
harry,"I know that, but what do you want from me?"
shelly,"Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, ""if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper."""
harry,"Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive."
shelly,"I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter."
arthur,"Excuse me Harry, Shelly, the minister's about to begin."
harry,Thank you Arthur.
minister,"We are here to honor Thomas James Sennett. He was born, May 7 1961, in Madison, Pennsylvania, and he was survived by his loving parents, Charles and Susan Sennett...... "
minister,"The family has asked me to say a few words before we proceed. No words that I could say, would begin to describe the loss and grieving, one word that keeps ringing in my ear is Why?. Why would God choose to take this little boy from us? I can't give you an answer to that question, but I can tell you that God has chosen Thomas J for some very special reason, we must find solace in knowing that Thomas J is now in Gods care. In that face, there is no sorrow such as...."
minister,"....disciples began to chastise them, and Jesus said ""Let the children come to me, do not hinder them, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these.  He laid his hands on their heads before he left that place, let us pray in silence."
vada,Wanna go tree climbing Thomas J?
vada,"His face hurts, and where is his glasses? He can't see without his glasses! Put his glasses on!  Put on his glasses! He was gonna be an acrobat."
harry,He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
vada,"Get away, get away!!"
harry,Vada wait! Vada! Vada!!
vada, Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
vada,"Mr. Bixler,  I love you."
vada,I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
vada,"No he wouldn't, I can't go home."
suzanne,"I'll be ready in a second, I just can't seem to find my other earring...."
suzanne," Vada, hi, I'm really sorry."
suzanne,Yeah.
vada,Who's that?
vada,No....
vada,Get away from me!
vada's thoughts,Why do you think people wanna get married?
vada's thoughts,It's my mother.
vada's thoughts,Now we're blood brothers for life.
policeman,Shelly I'm sorry but we haven't found her yet.
shelly,"It's dark, she can't be alone in the dark."
policeman,We'll keep looking.
shelly,"We, no, we've been looking since this morning, her teacher called, and he said that she went there first....."
policeman,"I know, I know you told us."
shelly,But I....
shelly,Vada. Are you okay?  Oh God.
vada,I should have told Thomas J that he was my best friend.
shelly,I'm sure he knew.
vada,"Shelly, I stole some money from your cookie jar, to pay for the writing class."
shelly,It's okay sweetheart.
vada,"I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again."
shelly,"I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing."
vada,I will I promise.
shelly,"Okay, get in to bed."
shelly,Goodnight.
vada,Goodnight.
shelly, She's in.
vada,Did I kill my mother?
harry,What??
vada,"The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother."
harry,"No, no."
harry,"No sweetie that wasn't your fault, things like that aren't anybody's fault, it just happened."
vada,I found this.
harry,"I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?"
vada,In the garage.
harry,"Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car."
vada,What was my mama like?
harry,"She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her."
vada,Really?
harry,Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
vada,Do you miss her?
harry,"Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked."
vada,I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
harry,"That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning."
vada,"Daddy, it's not so bad to be like you."
harry,"Mrs. Sennett, how are you doing?"
harry,Oh she's doing much better. Ahh she's just inside. 
vada,Mrs. Sennett. 
vada,"I will, I promise."
vada,"Mrs. Sennett.  Thomas J will be all right, my mother will take care of him."
justin,What exactly do you mean by that?
justin,"Hey, we missed you man! Gimme a hug!"
vada,"I can't stay, I just came to read my poem."
vada,"Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart."
vada,Hi Judy.
judy,Hi Vada.
vada's thoughts,"Things are a little better these days; I finally swallowed that chicken bone, Judy and I are gonna be in the same home room and the republican party just re-nominated Mr. Nixon."
