another angle, He attacks the underside of the sailboat which is covered with green algae muck that hangs a foot off the bottom of the boat.  The spatula scrapes away the green mess revealing the pure white underside of the boat.
summerall,"That play, my friends, sums up the Redskins' running game all day long. Now Washington calls their last time out."
madden,"Hey, the Dolphins do this as good as anybody. See, in a four, three, two, two, you got the guards... boom!... Plugging up the middle, then the corners... boom and"
summerall,"Third and twenty-two, but forget the first down with eight seconds showing and the Skins down by a touchdown."
madden,Could be the last play.
summerall,Could be the last play of the season if the players go out.
summerall," Once again, if you haven't heard, it was announced during halftime that the N.F.L. Players Association will hold a press conference immediately following this game -- that would make it about five o'clock Eastern time -- and it is expected that"
on redskinettes," Twelve striking-looking women dressed in burgundy and gold are doing some inane chatter to a section of fans that ignore them.  The girls are led by pretty ANNABELLE FARRELL, a bundle of manic energy inside a body from heaven.  MADDEN  It's all about money, folks. More money, of course and ain't it always? The shame of it is the big losers are you out there, the fans."
summerall," Here we go: Third down, eight seconds to play, ball on the Dolphins' thirty-three yard line. Skins down by a touchdown."
martel,Green 48! Green 48! Hut! Hut!
summerall,Well... Martel goes down ten yards short of a score.
madden,On maybe the last play of the season.
summerall,I think he might have slipped.
madden,"Yeah, there's a lot of that going around."
bob,"We're    coming to your house    tonight, and we're    gonna fucking kill    you! And if you got a    dog, we're gonna kill    your fucking dog too!"
on annabelle," Behind her, the rest of the cheerleaders are already walking away. Annabelle looks at Quarterback Martel with pure disgust as he walks off the field.  CUT TO:"
augustine,Did they win or lose?!
augustine,That has the distinct tonal quality of a loss.
augustine,"Nice medicine for a loss. Keeps us calm. Makes us not so sad. Keeps us on an even keel. Gives us some perspective, doesn't it? And we'll save the winning medicine for next Sunday, won't we?"
augustine,Sounds exciting.
augustine,"We'll want to talk to coach now, won't we?"
tildon, I think he slipped.
tildon,"Mister O'Neil, let's face facts: The players are going out. It's gonna happen. And nobody wants to get hurt on the last play before a strike that could go on for the rest of the season."
augustine,"Better? It always makes you feel better when you fire someone, we know it does, don't we? Yes..."
wilson,"Hey, man, I do what my"
reporter,But you're already one of the highest paid players in the game. The fans just don't see the point of a player like you striking.
wilson,"Let me tell you something: I'm a big man, you see?"
wilson,"There are some days when I am so beat up, that I cannot dress my own big ass. I asked management for a valet or some shit to help me dress and they said no way. So, fuck 'em!"
on tv," A handsome ex-player named Jerome Lindell steps up to a podium at a press conference. He's wearing a two thousand dollar suit.  On the TV he is identified with a super:  ""JEROME LINDELL -- President -- National Football League Players' Association.""  LINDELL  Therefore, I am recommending that all N.F.L. players walk out and not play until our demands are met. I want the players to walk out tall, to walk out righteous, to walk out in the knowledge that we do this as a team. We shall overcome the fat cats. I send peace to my union brothers.  The entire locker room is silent for a beat. And then everyone starts getting dressed again, maybe a little slower than before."
wilson,"Shit, I'm goin' to Vegas."
pilachowski,... Six phone lines with internet access on two: One for defense and one for offense.
banes,We thought we would skip special teams for the moment.
pilachowski,Except for a kicker. We definitely need a kicker. A place kicker over a punter.
banes,"The thinking being that if we lose the toss, we have to be able to at least kick off."
pilachowski,Okay. Here's the list of every player cut this past season. What we would like to do is...
evans,You won't need a center.
evans,Bored and ready to retire. I'm just looking for one more hit. One more really good hit.
evans,"Hell, I'm rich. I got no complaint with Mister O'Neil. I just want a chance to play one last time. "
biker,Did you hear something?
bateman,What area code is 703?
kid,Nice hands.
clifford, What else?
kid,"A pack of Marlboro Reds, a pint of Martel Cognac and a box of Trojans, extra long."
clifford,Get out of here. I'm telling your mother you were talking like that.
manager,"Hey, Clifford, somebody on the phone wants you to play football next weekend."
clifford,Tell 'em I gotta work Saturday. And I'm watching the Redskins on Sunday. Ain't nothing stopping me from watching the Redskins on Sunday.  No way that's gonna be
manager, They said they'll pay you.
clifford,Pay me?    How much?
manager, Ten thousand five hundred dollars!
clifford," Ray, who the fuck is on the phone?!"
manager, It's the Washington Redskins!
jamal," Don't look at him! He don't like being looked at, god damn it! No eye contact!"
shane,And you look like that coach from the Seventies. From the Redskins. McGinty. Except you look a shitload older.
shane,"You know what my nickname was in San Diego, don't you?"
shane,"As in, I hear 'em and I dump the ball."
shane,I got two concussions to prove it.
shane, No kidding?
shane,Forty-five. And now you want to recruit me?
shane,Okay.   What's my
shane,I'm retired from football.
shane,I like being here. It's quiet. I like being alone.

lou, Who is it?
mother,It's the Washington Foreskins.
lou,"What?! Ma, what are you, out a your tree?"
mother, I'm telling you they said it's the

roland,"Cut right on me, now. Right on me."
roland,"Not right on me, goddamn it!"
roland," Thank you, Lord!"
evans,Nice. Try a roll to the right.
augustine,Here we go. Nice fat little hits.
on shane, He drills a perfect spiral through the circle.  CUT TO:
reporter,"As president of the Players' Association, what does your presence mean here, Mister Lindell?"
lindell,"Very simply, support for these fine players and union men. Washington D.C. is the home of freedom and the collective bargaining agreement. I am here to remind all Americans that the owners are no better than the robber barons of the Nineteenth Century. They have blatantly gone out and hired scabs, which is against all principles of our Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and probably even the Emancipation Proclamation."
lindell,And here come the Scabskins now!
players,Scabskins! Scabskins! Scabskins!
clifford,"Oh God, there's Eddie Martel! And Wilson Jones! I love Wilson Jones! Yo, Wilson! Yo, player!"
on wilson, His big face looms right outside the bus window. He looks pissed off and scary.
lou,"Hey, Lou Pacifico."
shane,Shane Falco.
lou,I know. I lost a ton a money on that Sugar Bowl disaster of yours. Wow. Did you get your butt kicked or what?
jamal,You know I don't take that shit.
andre,Be cool.
players,Scabskins! Scabskins!
sid,He told me he was a linebacker!
shane,I can see.
shane,"Two.   No, wait.    Three."
pilachowski,Oh my God. That's disgusting!
lee,"Not bad, Coach."
lee,You got it.
pilachowski,You're not serious.
banes, I got a defensive end who's deaf!!
pilachowski, I'll trade you for a tackle who's gonna play in a diaper.
banes,How can I coach a deaf man?!
banes,I can't believe it! I got to be able to communicate with him.
shane,Oh shit! No!
bateman,"Hi, I'm Danny."
shane, Shane.
bateman,"Thank's, Coach!"
shane,What was that?
shane,I'm very interested in that.
practice montage," A)    BATEMAN  is lined up at middle linebacker. When the play starts, he runs headlong into four blockers and takes them all down with him.  B)    WIDE RECEIVER CLIFFORD FRANKLIN  beats his man, and turns as Shane, rolling out to his left, puts the ball right on his numbers. Franklin drops it.  C)    ANDRE AND JAMAL  On the snap, they pull to lead a sweep. Unfortu-nately, each thinks the play is to their side. They forearm each other and then get into a fight.  D)    LOU PACIFICO  boots one from thirty-five yards through the uprights. He smiles, takes out a Marlboro Light and a Bic and fires up.  E)    CLIFFORD FRANKLIN  pulls up, does a button hook and Shane puts the ball in his hands. Franklin drops it.  F)    LEE  the Sumo guy, hits the blocking sled and turns it over.  G)   BATEMAN  is down on the ground viciously punching another player as two assistants try to pull him off.  H)   FRANKLIN  is in a crossing pattern in the end zone. Shane puts the ball right in front of him. Unfortunately, it hits him in the hands.  CUT TO:"
annabelle,"Annabelle Farrell, head Redskinette."
shane,Excuse me?
annabelle,I'm in charge. Of the Redskinettes. The cheerleaders?
shane,"Oh yeah, hi."
annabelle,I've been watching you. You look good. You look strong. Good quick release. Smart. You read defenses quickly. You're gonna do great.
shane,Hey... thanks.
annabelle,I saw your second concussion. The one
shane,I guess so.
annabelle,"If there's anything you need, let me know. And I mean anything, okay? You understand?"
shane,Sure.   I understand.
annabelle,They put you up at the Hilton?
shane,Yeah.
annabelle,Good. Remember: anything. You got it? Okay?
clifford,"I know, Coach, I know."
clifford,"Oh yeah, Coach, sure. In a, you know, romantic way."
clifford,"Coach, wait! Can I still like touch my girl friends if I don't, you know, let go of the ball?"
shane,... just glad to be back playing. That's all I've really got to say.
reporter,But where have you been? What have you been doing to make a living?
shane,Well... I've been involved lately in the... aquatic business...
mickey,You only played one game?!
roland,"Actually, less than two minutes. I was a rookie third round pick in '93. We were playing Atlanta in the home opener. Near the end of the first quarter, they sent me in, I took a screen pass over the middle and got hit by both linebackers. Simultaneously. One a"
mickey,Can you play on it now?
roland,"I've been teaching high school football for five years. It's not a bad life. I'm good at it. There are some days when I actually love it. But for one more shot at this? Shit. I'd give it all up. This time, they're gonna have to take me out in a box."
clifford,"I got Wilson Boone's locker, man. Do you believe that shit?"
martel,"Hey, you can't park there."
shane,"Look, I don't want any trouble."
martel,"You don't want any trouble?! You're taking my job away, but you don't want any trouble?  He doesn't want any trouble, but he puts this piece of shit in a no parking zone."
shane,Okay.   I'll move it.
martel,"No, we'll do that for you. Go ahead, Wilson. Move it for him."
wilson,Who the fuck are you?
andre,We're the people who take care of the quarterback. We're the guards.
jamal,Put the car back. Gently.
wilson,Kiss my ass.
shane, It's okay.
jamal,"No, it's not."
jamal," That's your ride, ain't it?"
wilson,My windshield! You crazy motherfucker!
jamal,Move his car back.
wilson,My car!
wilson,No!   Stop!
wilson,"Come on, help me, god damn it!"
wilson, You are gonna pay for this.
jamal,No I'm not. And quit messing with my man here. That includes his ride.
andre,"Let's go to practice, Shane."
shane,Let's do that.
walter,"Praise the Lord, Shane."
shane,Yeah.   Sure.
walter,Walt Cochran. Offensive tackle.
walter,"Shane, will you witness with me?"
shane,Will I what?
walter,Will you witness with me? For this upcoming practice.
shane,Now?
walter,"Praise the Lord for giving us a way to eliminate, Shane. Why not talk to Him in the midst of performing his gift?"
walter,"Heavenly Father, thank you for allowing us to pee the poisons from our systems. Please help us in today's practice to be strong and..."
banes,"Where did you play, Judge? Wait. Do I call you judge?"
judge,"Your Honor, or Judge is fine. I played at Harvard. But I played in the days when you went both ways. Offense and defense. When players were really tough.  And where did you play college ball... I'm sorry, what was your name again?"
wilkinson,"Smith. Ray Smith. I played at a junior college nobody ever heard of. What position did you play on defense, Judge?"
judge,Middle linebacker.
wilkinson,"Yeah, big fellow like you, that's what I would have guessed."
judge,"It was a different game in those days. Raw. Powerful. No tricks, like today."
wilkinson,"You know, maybe you can show me some of your technique, Your Honor. Maybe you can show me some of that toughness."
judge,I'd be glad to!
annabelle, You would think he's done enough.
annabelle,"McGinty, I mean."
shane,I was kind of thinking the same thing.
annabelle,"My theory is he came out of retirement to see if he could win with losers.  Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I didn't mean..."
shane," Hey, it's okay. I've been called worse."
annabelle,Like    after that Sugar Bowl    game? I guess you could    survive anything after    that.
shane,"Sometimes I feel like everybody in the world saw that game. Like I could go to India and some little guy would run up to me and say, 'Boy, did you suck in"
shane,"So, how come you're such a fan?"
annabelle,"My dad. He's a huge Redskin fan. For years. He's in his twenty-ninth year at the Senate Office Building. As a guard, not a senator. The only thing that keeps him going he says, is me and the Redskins. That's where I get it. My fan-ness.  Are you scared?"
shane,Scared? Well... yes. Absolutely.
annabelle,It's okay. Anybody would be. But you're good. And you'll do good.
shane,"Well, thank you. Look, I gotta study the play book tonight. So... I'll see you."
annabelle,Break a leg tomorrow.
shane,What?!
annabelle,It's    from the theater. For    opening night. You say    the worst thing that    can happen. And
judge,"Alright, this is how we used to stop a running back."
wilkinson,I can't wait.
wilkinson,"Oooh... got me a judge! Man, that felt good!"
lindell, Don't be asking    for no autographs from    the real players and    then go in and watch    the scabs!
lindell, That is not the message we want to send our children!
evans,You okay?
evans,Remember to nod your head on the snap.
shane, Nod my head?
evans,For    when Murray's in. The    deaf kid. Hello? He    needs to look at you on    the snap.
pilachowski,"What are you, crazy? Nobody eats right before a game."
lee,I always ate before a big match. I need the bulk.
madden,"... Pretty bold move by New England Patriot owner Victor Kiam, who went out and bought an entire semi-pro team once the strike happened. "
summerall,"Like Shane Falco, the enormously talented college quarterback from Ohio State, who never fulfilled his potential in the pro's.  Wow, remember that"
madden,"Oh, yeah, they were absolutely decimated!"
summerall,"Dusted. And if I'm not mistaken, Falco set a record in that game for Bowl interceptions. Anyway, for some of these players this is another shot; a last shot, probably, for a guy like Falco..."
announcer," Ladies and gentlemen, your Washington Redskins!"
announcer, Here's the starting defense today...
announcer," At middle linebacker, number 56, Daniel Bateman!"
on bateman," He trips big-time into the side of the helmet. He bounces  to the other side, bounces again and is shot out of the front of it like a cannon ball."
on cheerleaders, Bateman bounces out of the helmet and takes out the first six cheerleaders.  Girls fly left and right.       One girl is knocked out of her shoes.
summerall,"Oh, my..."
in stands," Even the hardcore Todd, Rob and Bob can hardly look at the carnage."
outside stands, A contingent of strike players like Eddie  Martel and Wilson Jones huddle in the parking lot. They are laughing their asses off as they watch on a personal TV.
on field," Cheerleaders are down and screaming in pain. Annabelle is running from girl to girl, doing triage."
on bateman, He's sheepishly standing to one side as trainers come out to assist.
jamal,Bastards.
announcer," And now... uh, the rest of the Washington Redskins."
andre,That's where I stand.
lee,No it's not.
andre,"Come on, man, that's my spot in the huddle."
andre,... Fat fucking nip! You don't know shit!
lee,What did you call me?!
andre,"You heard me, you tub a rice shit!"
shane,"Hold on, what's the problem here?"
lee,I'm gonna kick your black ass...
andre,You ain't kickin' jack shit...
jamal, Don't be messing with my brother...
shane,"Hey, hold on..."
ref,Delay of game!    Five yards!
in huddle," Lee suddenly punches Andre through his face guard. Andre knocks into Shane and spins him around. Jamal then goes to punch Lee, he misses and nails Shane in the back of the helmet.  Shane goes down hard."
summerall,"... I don't know. Something seems to be going on in the huddle. It looks like... yes, Shane Falco is on his back. They haven't run a play yet but Falco is down."
madden,This is not a good sign.
shane, What happened? Am I hurt already?
shane,God damn it! I am the quarterback! I am the only one supposed to talk in the huddle!
andre,"Yeah, but he took my place..."
shane,I don't give a shit!
shane,Huddle up!
shane,"If you've got something to say, raise your hand! Is that understood?!"
lee,"Suppose like, you don't feel good. Or you're hurt or something like that. Then what?"
shane,"Then you tell me before the huddle starts! Okay, listen up: 68 blue east storm toss. On two."
shane,What?!
jamal,That's to the right... right?
andre,"No, it's to the left."
shane,It's to the right!
jamal,"You better be quiet, Shane, they'll hear you."
ref,Delay of game!     Five yards!
madden,"Well, Pat, so far the Redskins have minus ten yards offensively."
shane,Blue 68. Blue 68! Hut! Hut!
shane,"Have you suddenly decided you don't like me, Jamal?"
jamal,"Oh. You said it was to the right, didn't you?"
shane,Okay. Let's try something simple. 18 red left slot open.  That's to the left!
shane,Eighteen red! Eighteen red! Hut! Hut!
shane,Yeah!
cochran,You see. We should have prayed.
shane,"Shut up! Pass. 22 Solo right slot 'A,' Y stick. On one."
shane,Twenty-two green.    Hut!
summerall, Washington comes up a minus fourteen yards on their first possession.
earl,Wide right! You got wide right! Check on the wing!
patriot qb,Blue fourteen!
on sideline, Defensive Coordinator Banes rolls his eyes.  The Ref moves the ball five yards and gives the offside sign.
patriot qb,Green eighty-seven!
on sideline, Banes is screaming something unintelligible at Bateman.
summerall, I think the Redskins just set a record for penalties in the first three minutes. We're waiting for the stats on that...
on shane, He's rolling in the back field again looking for a receiver.
shane's pov, Nothing but meat coming at him.
shane,What?
lee,I don't feel good.
andre,"Oh, God!"
cochran,Oooooh...
jamal,"Man, that's ripe!"
evans,"Shane, we got to move!"
shane,Okay. On the count of three. Everyone more left. Hut! Hut! Hut!
patriot lb,What the fuck is this?
summerall,"John, how many years have we been calling games together?"
madden,"Seventeen, I think."
shane,"U brown right, west 19 A lead. That's you, Mickey. Puke on him if you have to."
on huddle, The huddle stops and they break for the line of scrimmage.
on lee, He lines up face to face with the Patriots' defensive end.  Lee breathes in the guy's face and the Patriot gags.  SHANE  Hut!  Lee runs right over the guy.       He's quickly  followed by Lamont with the ball.  Lamont runs for eighteen yards and a first down.
summerall, That puts the Redskins in field goal range. And here comes Pacifico to see if he can get them on the board before the half ends.
on pacifico, He flicks his smoke away as he runs out onto the field.
shane,Hut!
on pacifico," He gets high fives all around. Then Bateman runs up and in his ecstasy, slaps Pacifico in the head.  Pacifico goes down, knocked out cold."
on cheerleaders," Led by Annabelle, the girls are doing a stirring finale to ""Hail to the Redskins.""  CUT TO:"
shane,"We can't put three plays together without a penalty, a fumble of a fight."
shane,You're good. You're really good.
on wilkinson," Earl is covering the intended receiver. He deftly steps in front of the guy, and makes a diving catch."
summerall,Another terrific interception by Smith. That's his second.
madden,"Yeah, this guy is a player."
madden,"According to the Redskins, Ray Smith... is... that's weird. No college given, no high school given. It just says he's been a resident of the state of Maryland for the last four years and five months. Likes to embroider."
shane,"Okay, let's all take a few seconds to think about what we were doing for a living... just last week."
shane,Good. Let's kick ass. Red right pass 15 x
shane,Red fifteen! Red fifteen! Hut!
montage," A)   SHANE  is under pressure but he rolls smoothly and rockets the ball downfield.  Murray pulls it in for fifteen yards.  B)   SHANE  rolls left off the shotgun, fights off a cornerback and throws back across field, complete to Lamont coming out of the backfield.  C)   PATRIOT  is calling for a fair catch on a punt. He catches the ball but Bateman flies INTO FRAME and decks him. Flags fly.  D)   ANDRE AND JAMAL  are blocking side by side, pushing their men back as Lamont squeezes through with the ball.  E)   EVANS  is pass blocking like the all pro that he is. He knocks his man flat and then doubles up on Cochran's man.  F)   BATEMAN  is pursuing a running back.   He knocks down an official and runs right over him. Then he gets his hands on the running back and pushes him out of bounds and then knocks over a photographer.  G)   SHANE  pumps once and then drills a twenty yard spiral.  Clifford Franklin beats his man and dives for the ball. He bobbles it, and then squeezes it to his stomach as he hits the ground.  CUT TO:"
on pacifico," Boom!   He boots the extra point.  Scoreboard:    Patriots 17, Redskins 10.  DISSOLVE TO:"
shane,"Hut, hut!"
on franklin, He's wide open five yards from the goal line.
on shane, They're breathing down his back.
shane's pov," He sees Franklin and cocks his arm. Suddenly, opposing jerseys are everywhere.  Shane dumps the ball. He's immediately decked by a defensive end."
on ball, We watch the flight of it in SLOW MOTION. We FOLLOW it right INTO the hands of... a New England Patriot defensive back.
on shane, He's down and not moving.
summerall, Falco is intercepted. That's too bad.
on shane, He's helped off the field and onto the bench.
bateman,"The ball. Okay, Coach."
patriot qb,"Hut, hut, hut!"
on crowd, They go wild!
on annabelle, She does a cartwheel.
shane,I can't...
summerall, Here comes Falco with eighteen seconds left on the clock.
shane,22 green!
shane,Check! Black 43! Black 43!
andre,What's that mean?
reese, He's changing the play. Listen!
shane,Black 43!
lamont, Is this right?
shane, Black 43 left!
shane,Hut!   Hut!
summerall, Lamont scores!
summerall," With eight seconds remaining, Pacifico will try the extra point that will send this game into overtime."
on pacifico, He sets up for the kick.
on shane, He waits for the snap.
shane,Hut!
reese,"We won, Shane.   We won!"
shane,"... ultimately, it's a pain thing, you know? I mean, it's Darwinian, the survival of the numbest. Whoever can take the pain most, gets the largest contract. It's sick."
woman,IN RED Exactly. Let me buy you another.
shane, I'm glad that you are concerned.
shane,I would like.
shane,Here's home.
shane, Oooooh. Bookends.
annabelle, Go away. Both of you.
shane, These are my guests.
shane,Why did you do that?
annabelle,You were about to be rolled.
shane, That's what I was hoping.
annabelle,They work the bar downstairs looking for drunk Redskins.
shane,I guess they found one.
annabelle,Don't feel so bad. It's a rookie mistake.
annabelle,Here.   Take this.
shane, What is it?
annabelle,It's for the pain. Take it. It's only a little bit illegal.
shane,"Oh, God. I've got to go to the bathroom. It's far away, isn't it?"
annabelle,I'll help. We'll just take our time.
annabelle,Kidneys.
shane,"Oh, man. My hair hurts."
annabelle,"You took a hell of a beating. The martinis didn't help, either."
annabelle,Don't be afraid if you've got blood in your urine. That's normal.
annabelle,Yes.
annabelle,Yes.
annabelle,Are you kidding? You were catatonic.
shane,No blood.
annabelle,Good.   Back to bed.
shane,May I ask you a personal question?
shane,Do you do this for all Redskin quarterbacks?
annabelle,Of course not.
shane,Then why me?
annabelle,I don't know. I guess I can't resist a man who can take a hit.
shane,I can't take a hit!
annabelle,"Shhh. It's all in your head. Now, get some sleep."
annabelle,You're the golden boy in the press this morning.
annabelle,"'Falco scores big.'  Hey, a lot of the regular players are starting to cross the picket line."
annabelle,It doesn't say.
annabelle,Where are you going?
shane,McGinty called a dinner meeting with the whole team.
shane,Thank you. Thanks for... everything.     You saved my life.
annabelle,No. Probably just your wallet and your watch.
shane,"And that pill, that sure worked."
annabelle,You're basic double D Vicodin. But be careful: It's habit- forming. The best stuff always is.
shane,Well...
annabelle,Ice both knees and that shoulder before bed.
montage," A)    ANDRE AND JAMAL  are trying to hail a cab on Wisconsin Avenue. Suddenly, one cab, then two, then four SLAM on their BRAKES.  Cabbies hop out to open their doors for the brothers.  B)    ROLAND LAMONT  walks down G Street with Brian Murray. Brian spots something in a store window and stops Roland.  Roland gasps as he sees himself duplicated on ten TV screens in an appliance store. He's on tape being interviewed at a Redskins' practice.  C)    EARL WILKINSON  dressed in casual chic, is moving quickly through Lord and Taylor's Department  Store    with two sales clerks in tow. He stops,    grabs four cashmere sweaters, smells    them, hands them to one clerk and moves    on.  D)    LOU PACIFICO  is standing in front of the White House. He has a line of ten people who are paying five bucks for an autographed picture of himself that he hands out from a huge stack.  CUT TO:"
reporter,"Coach, what will be your strategy against New York this Sunday?"
newsperson," ... The Palm patrons showed an impromptu appreciation tonight for the new Washington Redskins. They may be unknowns and far from superstars, but it sure looks like they have charmed the fans."
shane,Hi.    Come in.
annabelle,No.
annabelle,"We don't travel with the team. So, here's Tylenol with codeine, regular Vicodins, the magic bullet one that I gave you before, and a couple of Darvons if you actually break something. Pop 'em in the ambulance."
shane,Wow.    Thanks.
annabelle,I'll be watching on TV. The Giants got back three of their four defensive linemen.
shane,Yeah.   I know.
annabelle,What can I say? Go from the shotgun and scramble your ass off.
morris," Hello, again!"
madden,"That's all-pro Hank Morris's third sack, his second here in the fourth quarter and the sixth of the day for"
summerall,If he can stay alive that long. Ten-three New York in what has turned out to be an incredible defensive duel.
lindell,"... because it's about brothers, and brotherhood and standing together against the oppressors. That's why I am so grateful to our Teamster brothers who have joined us here today in New York to protest the greed squad known as the N.F.L. owners."
shane, You got to double up on Morris.
evans,He's too far outside for me to get to him.  Bring him down and sit on him.
cochran,He's huge! He's been beating the crap out of me all day! I feel like a rag doll out here.
lee,I'll help this time.
shane,"Okay. Spread left 'A' Right, roll right Half Back Sail. On two."
shane,"Red, fifteen.   Hut, hut!"
shane,Huddle up!
shane,Same thing... Except...  Let him in. Don't touch him.
lee,What?
evans,Shane...
shane,Shut up! Let him through. On two.
shane,Red fifteen. Hut!
shane,Get him!
murray's pov," It's absolutely QUIET  as he soars towards Morris's head, helmet and ball.  Wham! Murray's full body weight hits Morris in the helmet, which flies off and rolls across the field with the ball still stuck in it.  OUT OF THE SILENCE, we suddenly hear the hit and the crowd roar.  Morris goes down like a building with Murray buried in his throat."
madden,Lee scores! Lee scores! Lee scores! I love to see a fat guy score!
on lee," He gets up in jubilation, spikes the ball/helmet combination, and runs through the back of the end zone.  But he doesn't stop. He's aiming for a low wall that separates the first row of fans from the field."
on mickey, He launches himself into the stands in ecstasy.
on football, It's hiked into Shane's hands and Pacifico boots the extra point.
pacifico, What a hit!
evans," I'm proud of you, kid."
andre,"You're the one, you're the one, you're the one..."
lee,You think that's worth a shoe deal?
shane,"No! Danny, go down! You're using up the clock!"
shane, Time out!
bateman,"Beautiful tackle, Shane!"
summerall, Now that's something you don't see everyday!
shane,"We got time for one play, but if we don't get it out of bounds, the game is over."
pacifico, No problem.
shane,Seriously?
pacifico, You hold it. I'll kick it.
madden,I can't believe it! McGinty is gonna let Pacifico try the field goal from sixty-five yards out!
summerall,"Hey, John, this kid has got a heck of a foot."
stram,But sixty-five yards? Come on!
summerall," No, I think you imagined that one, John."
shane,"You look great, Lou, you know that?"
lou,"Really? Thanks, Shane. That means a lot to me."
shane,Hut!
annabelle,Are you hurt?
shane,No.     Not really.
annabelle,You're getting used to being slapped around. That's a good sign.
shane,I...
annabelle,Would you like to come in and make love?
shane,Yes. No. I'm here because ... I don't want to be alone.
annabelle,Most    of the world feels that    way. You don't have    to be embarrassed about    it.
shane,But to tell you the truth... I'm kind of scared of you.
annabelle,I won't hurt you.
annabelle,That shoulder is going to need special handling.
shane,You know what hurts
annabelle,I can't imagine.
shane,Their defensive end punched me in the mouth.
shane,Seriously. It's killing me.
shane,"... after that game, after being beaten that badly in front of the whole country, after humiliating myself, my team, my school, my family, I mean -- did you know that I set two Sugar Bowl records?! I was sacked eleven times! I threw six interceptions!"
annabelle,Okay.   Calm down.
shane,"Anyway, after that, I could never seem to adjust in the pros. I was too scared. I lost my balls."
annabelle,"Well, they're back."
shane,You know what I mean. My nerve. I lost the edge you need to play this game.
annabelle,"I don't believe that. I don't think it just goes away. It was only one bad day, Shane. Everybody has those."
shane,"No. Somehow, I convinced myself that I couldn't ever win the big game. I got so down, that I was afraid to be playing when a game was on the line. I was afraid to screw up. That's the sure sign of a loser. From there, it wasn't very far to thinking that I'll never win, that I didn't deserve to win at anything. Including love."
annabelle,You're wrong. You're winning now. You're winning me.

reporter,"No, Bob, but rumor has it that the National Football League Player's Association had something to do with it."

lee," You'll score, too, with a Cadillac from Coleman Cadillac. It's a big car, for a big man."
lee," What?! I'm not doing it again! Who are you, Orson Welles?! This is nuts!"
shane,What's this?
martel,This is a visit.
shane,A visit. Who let you in?
martel,I used to nail one of the housekeepers.
shane,Lucky girl.
martel," You know who these guys are, don't you?"
shane,Dallas Cowboys.     Howdy.
martel,You'll be seeing a lot of these guys tomorrow.
shane,What do you want?
martel,"Who, me? Not much. But these boys wanted a little head start on you."
shane,I'm flattered that you actually think we have a chance to win.
martel,It can be a game of luck. And under no circumstances can we allow a scab team to go three and O. Especially against the Dallas Cowboys. It's just not good for the
shane,Is the union behind this 'visit'?
martel,"I can't really say, Shane. By the way, have you ever tried throwing a football with bruised ribs?"
martel,The pain makes it damn near impossible.
martel,And one other thing: I want you to stay away from Annabelle.
martel,"The sad fact is she won't give me the time of day. But you can't have everything I want. I can't let that happen. So, you gotta stop seeing her. Just on principle."
martel,Let me hear you say it.
martel,Come on. You can do it.
shane, I won't go out with her
martel,"Good.  Hey, have a great game!"
lindell,"I think that Mister Matheson here, and myself, are very close to an agreement that will put the 'pro' back in pro-football."
reporter,"Mister Matheson, what are the sticking points in the negotiations as far as the owners are concerned?"
matheson,Only one: that the players immediately go back to work with no change in the existing contract.
al,"Good evening from the Big O here in Washington D.C. where the mighty Dallas Cowboys take on the Cinderella Washington 'Scabskins' as they have come to be known. Hi, I'm Al Michaels and we are witnesses to a unique matchup tonight as Shane Falco and a contingent of strike players go up against the entire regular squad of the Dallas Cowboys. Yes, you heard right: every Cowboy has now crossed the picket line, some as late as this afternoon, and they will all play tonight. Can a rag tag group of hasbeens and castoffs stand up to what was once called America's team? And what about the strike itself? It has been so ineffective that many predict it will be over before this game ends. Stay tuned as Boomer and Dan join me for strike ball, D.C. style."
shane,"Whatever you say, Coach."
al,That    is one    very big leg    on Lou    Pacifico. He's    a big    reason why this    strike    team is two
dan,"But the fact is, a kicker does not an offense make. I think tonight the Scabskins will have a very rude awakening."
boomer,"But you have to admit, Dan, Falco is proving to be the real thing."
dan,"Well, Boomer, no, I don't have to admit anything."
boomer, Here we go...
annabelle,Shane!
butler,No problem.
on shane, He under-throws a very weak-looking pass to Lamont.  Shane grits his teeth against the pain.
butler,"I'm gonna autograph your body with bruises, you scab-ass son of a bitch!"
shane, Like Christmas morning.
dan,What pursuit! Butler never gave up on him. That's a 270-pound guy who moves like a halfback.
boomer,"Dan, I think Butler's hit on Falco was late, to tell you the truth."
dan,"Well, of course you do. You were a wimp quarterback."
al,"Easy, guys."
shane,Okay.    Red right 15 X hook.
shane,15 X hut!
lamont,Shane!
al,That's the end of the
dan,"Al, the battle is being fought and won in the trenches. You can't expect a bunch of pick- up players to stand up to a professional pass rush like the Cowboys."
boomer,"There's still a whole half left, Dan. And remember, Falco is proving to be a second- half quarterback."
dan,You got to be kidding.
boomer,"Those big, fat boys in the trenches get awful tired. You ought to know that, Dan."
al,"Okay, let's join Chris Berman with our half- time show. Chris?"
al,What's wrong with you guys?!
boomer,He started it.
dan,I did not! You called me fat!
boomer,I did not! But you are!
al,Stop it!
shane,"I'm sorry, Roland. That was a great block."
roland,"For my last play in football, I'll take that block."
roland,I thought you were going to score. What happened? Did you slip?
roland,That's what I thought.
shane,"You were a warrior, Roland. I'm gonna miss you."
roland,It was a dream come true. Go kick some ass for me.
sid,"Hey, Shane, I just heard. Congratulations!"
wilkinson,Congratulations on what?
sid,Shane is staying on. He's gonna be Martel's backup.
andre,Is that true?
shane,"Yes, Andre. It's true."
franklin,"I got to tell you, Shane, you played the first half like you were staying. Like you already had a contract."
shane,"You're right, Clifford. And I'm sorry. But now I want to go out there and either beat these bastards or die trying. I never wanted to beat anybody so bad in my life."
earl,"I don't know what yawl are doin' tomorrow, but my ass is goin' back to jail. But if I gotta go, I want to go back a winner."
evans,"Hell, I'm retiring. I have thirty minutes of football left in my whole career. I'm homicidal!"
bateman,"Me, too, Reese!"
earl,Let's get it on!
shane,"Gentlemen, our problem is the Cowboys aren't afraid of us. But they should be!"
lamont,Damn straight!
shane,We've got one chance on offense to make our stand -- the first play of the half.
jamal,"One touchdown ain't gonna help, Shane."
shane,No.     But one nasty-ass play    might. We just gotta    be brave. And trust    each other.
shane,Help me with this.
shane,Somebody has to tape me up.
dan,It's about time. I say let the professionals back on the field. The fans deserve nothing less.
boomer,"Yeah, you would say that."
on ball, The Dallas kicker puts the ball in the end zone for a touchback.
annabelle,Are you okay? Is it your side?
shane,I'm okay. I owe you an apology.
annabelle,What?     You do?
shane,Yes. I'll explain later. But thank you for believing in me. You give me strength just looking at you.
butler,That wasn't too smart.
shane,Suck my dick.
linebacker,Are you ready for more
shane,Blue thirteen! Blue thirteen! Hut! Hut! Hut!
montage," On the snap, many things happen at once:  A)   COCHRAN  sticks his fingers inside Butler's face mask and pokes both eyes. Butler screams!  B)   SHANE  throws the ball as hard as he can at the middle Linebacker and hits him in the crotch. The guy grabs himself and collapses.  C)   CLIFFORD FRANKLIN  kicks his defender in the shins as hard as he can. The defender screams and falls down.  D)   BATEMAN  gets a cornerback across from him in a choke    hold. The guy can't breathe but Bateman holds on.  E)   WILKINSON  lifts up his defender's face guard and connects with a right hand to the guy's chin.  F)   LEE  pulls the defensive lineman in front of him to the ground. Then he falls on him. The guy screams."
defender,He's got a knife!
butler, He scratched my eyes out!
linebacker,He hit me on purpose!
ref,"Unsportsmanlike conduct, number 72, number 81 and number 87 on the offense, fifteen yards...  ... how many yards so far?"
on ball, A ref is taking a very long walk with it. He stops at the Redskin two-yard line and puts it down.
shane,"Okay, everybody, stick"
butler,I can't believe you went for my eyes!
cochran,Shut up! I'm gonna do it again 'cause it was fun!
shane,Black 98! Black 98! Hut!
on cochran, He drops Butler with a vicious forearm.  Shane flicks the ball over the middle to Murray who pulls it in for fifteen yards and a first down.  CUT TO:
shane,Hut!   Hut!
on cochran, He slips while he's blocking Butler who takes  advantage of the situation and blows by him.
on shane," He's got Franklin crossing in the end zone. He cocks and throws, and simultaneously gets decked by Butler."
on ball, A Dallas defensive halfback     goes up for    it but just tips the ball. It      keeps going    now end over end... right into     the waiting    arms of Franklin who is standing     by himself    in the end zone.  Franklin is shocked.   His teammates run INTO FRAME and mob him.  AL  Maybe not so lucky. Falco is down.
on shane, He's on his back.
on annabelle, She looks worried as trainers run out onto the field.
shane,Put your tits on my head...
on franklin," He's holding for Pacifico on the extra point.  On the snap, Franklin bobbles the ball but manages to put it down.  Pacifico belts it through the uprights.  Scoreboard:    Dallas 24, Washington 21.  DISSOLVE TO:"
on wilkinson," He's on the field calling for a fair catch. He makes it.  AL  ... one minute twenty remaining, and even though Dallas didn't score, they sure ate up a lot of the clock."
shane,I can do it.
on redskins," They're hurrying back to the line of scrimmage. Wilkinson stands over center.  On the snap, Wilkinson throws the ball out of bounds.  AL  Wilkinson throws it away, and with twelve seconds remaining, the Redskins will try a forty-eight yard field goal to tie it up. That's almost a chip shot for Pacifico."
evans, Are you okay?
shane,"Just make it a good snap.  And you'll do the rest, right?"
on ball, Evans leans over it.
shane," Lou, are you alright?"
pacifico,I'm sorry. They know where my family lives.
shane,What?!
evans," Come on, Shane!"
shane,Hut!
on shane," He has totally caught the Cowboys by surprise. He sweeps around the right side.  The Dallas middle linebacker has recovered and is moving quickly to cut Shane off.  But Reese Evans comes out of nowhere and crushes the guy with a flying block.  Shane cuts downfield and heads for the end zone with nobody near him, except:  For the same safety from the first half who waits for him at the ten.  The safety smiles as he takes a bead on Shane.  Shane heads right for the guy. He puts his head down and smacks helmets with the safety. The guy goes down and Shane runs over him and into the end zone.  AL  Falco scores!"
on annabelle, She's jumping for joy.
ref,Clipping. Number 77 offense.
on shane, He's walking slowly back to the line of scrimmage.
pacifico,I broke my arm.  Thank you. You saved my ass.
shane, I have no idea.
lee,"I'm so sorry, Shane. I'm sorry, everybody."
shane,"No problem, Mickey.  Hell of a hit, Reese."
evans,That's the one I was looking for. I can retire in peace now.
shane,"Right after this play. So besides me, who really wants the ball?"
shane," Blue left slot open 'A' right. Two Jet 'X' drive. On three. Gentlemen, it's been an honor sharing the field of battle."
on clock, Three seconds are showing.
shane,Blue 58! Blue 58! Hut! Hut! Hut!
on murray, He cuts on a deep post.
on shane, He steps up and throws a clean bullet downfield. He roars in pain as he throws it.
on murray, The pass is perfect. He pulls it in and beats his man to the end zone.  Redskins win.
on crowd," It roars! ""Hail to the Redskins"" is deafening.  Todd, Rod and Bob are screaming.  O'Neil kisses Augustine.  Annabelle throws a punch into the air.  McGinty is all smiles.     Shane walks up to him and they shake hands.  Pilachowski and Banes hug.  Lee and Andre are hugging and crying.  Cochran is on his knees praying.     Reese Evans joins him.  Wilkinson hugs Jamal.  Clifford Franklin, hometown boy, throws himself into the stands where fans mob him."
brian's pov," We HEAR NOTHING, but somehow the pure energy of the moment comes through."
on shane," IN the SILENCE, he's walking in SLOW MOTION toward Annabelle. And everybody is smiling."
