Speaker,Dialogue
revised second draft," Registered WGAW  November 17, 1987"
veronica,"What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my..."
heather mcnamara,"God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather."
heather duke,"Yeah, she really wants to talk to you."
veronica,"Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus..."
veronica," Hello, Heather."
heather chandler,Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
veronica,"Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock."
heather chandler,"You don't have anything for her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks."
veronica,I'll think about it.
heather chandler, Don't think.
heather chandler,"Splendid. I'll dictate. Veronica needs something to write on. Heather, bend over."
heather chandler,How nice. Two assholes: no waiting.
heather chandler,"Heather Duke, back down."
heather chandler,"Dear Martha, you're so sweet.."
kurt,"It'd be so righteous to be in a Veronica Sawyer-Heather Chandler sandwich. Punch it in, Ram."
ram,Hell yes. I wanna set a Heather on my Johnson and just start spinning her like a fucking pinwheel.
earl,Shit. Right.
ram,Damn right right.
peter,"Come on people, let's give that leftover lunch money to people without lunches! Those tater tots you threw away today are a delicacy in Africa! They're Thanksgiving dinner!"
heather mcnamara," God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?"
veronica," Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent."
heather chandler,Sawyer. Guess what today is?
veronica,Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
heather duke,"Yeah, so what's the question?"
heather chandler,"God-damn Heather, you were with me in Study Hall when I thought of it. Such a pillowcase."
heather duke, I forgot.
veronica,"Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......"
heather chandler,"Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks."
betty,Sorry Veronica.
veronica,Betty Finn. Gosh.....
veronica,I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.
betty,"That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date."
veronica,Don't say that.
betty,"Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day."
veronica,I was talking with someone!
heather chandler,Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
courtney,Oh great. Here comes Heather.
courtney's friend,Shit.
heather chandler,"Hi Courtney. Love your blouse. Ooh, let me snare a tater."
courtney,Thanks. I just got it last night at the Limited. Totally blew my allowance.
heather chandler,"That's pretty very. Now check this out. You win five million dollars from Publishers Clearing House, but on the same day Ed McMahon gives you the check, aliens land on earth and say they're going to blow up the world in two days. What would you do?"
keith,That's easy. I'd just slide that wad over to my father. He's like one of the top brokers in the state.
veronica,"Wake up. In two days, Earth's going up like a Roman Candle. Crab Nebula City."
keith,"Man, in two days, my dad could double my money. Triple it."
courtney,"If I got that money, I'd give it all to the poor. Every cent."
veronica,You're beautiful.
peter,"Dennis, my man, run over to Mickey D.'s and get me a Big Mac and some fries."
dennis,But that's the Famine Fund money.
peter,"Hey, even Bob Geldof's got to eat. If it makes you feel better, bag the fries, and nab yourself an Apple Pie."
heather chandler,If you're going to openly be a bitch....
veronica," I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?"
heather chandler,"Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad."
rodney,Did you see that? Heather Number One looked right at us.
big cynic,It must be love.
veronica,Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
heather chandler,"Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior."
veronica,Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
heather chandler, Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
big cynic,Taking a hooker to the Pyramids on the last day of Mankind. You sentimental old fart.
braces,"Geez, forget it."
veronica,What about you Rodney?
rodney, I'd change my life. New clothes. New haircut. New house. New home.
heather chandler,How sad! Blowing all your cash on two days of trying to be hip.
veronica,If you're going to openly be a bitch....
heather mcnamara,"God, scan on Martha Dumptruck."
heather chandler,"This is the part I hate. The waiting. I'd say we're like twenty minutes from major humiliation. Come on, Veronica."
heather chandler,Veronica?
veronica,Damn..
matt,"You get five million dollars but some Martians are going to zap you in two days. You hear that, Clyde? That's got to be the most spooky-ass question I've ever heard."
betty finn,I think we should use the money for an End-of-the-world get-together. We could invite guys.
ram,"I'd pay Madonna one million dollars to ride my face like the Kentucky Derby. She should be paying me, though."
clyde,"If you want a good way to go out before the aliens land, get a lion from the zoo. Put a remote control bomb up its butt. When the lion starts tearing you up, press the bomb button. You and the lion die like as one."
heather chandler,"Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest."
veronica,Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
heather chandler,"Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?"
heather mcnamara,"Oh God, here we go..."
peter,A dime increases the time! A buck brings good luck! Hi Veronica. A five keeps the neighborhood alive! A ten and you die without sen!
heather chandler," You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing."
veronica,I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
heather chandler,"That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day."
veronica, We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
heather chandler,Come on you jerk. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
heather chandler,"Ku-urt, let's pa-arty."
heather mcnamara,"Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm."
veronica,A true friend's work is never done.
heather mcnamara,Color me nauseous.
veronica,Maybe you should see a doctor.
heather duke,"Yeah, maybe."
veronica,"Geez, don't listen to them."
heather duke,"Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense."
veronica,"Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed."
heather mcnamara,"God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History."
veronica,Give me the clipboard.
veronica,Hello Jason Dean.
jason,Greetings and salutations. Call me J.D. Are you a Heather?
veronica,"No, a Veronica. Sawyer. This may seem like a stupid question...."
veronica,"If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do?"
ram,Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
kurt,Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
ram,Let's kick his ass.
kurt,"Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though."
veronica,How very.
heather chandler,Come on.
ram,You going to eat this?
kurt,"What did your boyfriend say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?"
ram,Answer him dick!
kurt,"Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?"
kurt,What did you say dickweed?
heather mcnamara,"God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something."
heather chandler,He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
veronica,No way. He used blanks. All J.D. really did was ruin two pairs of pants...Maybe not even that...  Can you bleach out urine stains?
heather chandler,J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.
veronica,Never say never.
heather duke,"What are you going to do, Heather? Take the two shots or send me out?"
heather chandler,"Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast? First you ask if you can be red, knowing that I'm always red..."
heather duke,Shit.
heather chandler, Damn. It's your turn Heather.
heather duke,"No, it's Heather's turn."
heather chandler,"Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David."
heather mcnamara,King David.
heather chandler,"Maybe when you hit maturity you'll understand the diff between a Remington University man like David and a Westerburg boy like Ram ""Wham-bam- thank-you-maam"" Sweeney."
heather mcnamara,"Ram's sweet. Yo Heather, you're up."
heather mcnamara,"No way, no day!"
veronica,Give it up girl!
heather chandler,What. A. Shot.
heather mcnamara,So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
heather chandler,I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
veronica, Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
heather chandler,Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
heather duke,Why?
heather chandler,Why not?
mom,"Heather, your Mother's here."
heather mcnamara,Come on whoever wants a ride.
dad,"Take a break Veronica, sit down."
veronica,All right.
dad,So what was the first week of Spring Vacation withdrawl like?
veronica,"I don't know, it was okay, I guess."
mom,"Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?"
veronica,I guess.
mom,Any contestants worth mentioning?
veronica,Maybe. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
dad, Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
veronica, Because you're an idiot.
dad,"Oh yeah, that's it."
mom, You two....
veronica,"Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight."
heather chandler,Corn nuts!
veronica,"No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well."
veronica,Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
veronica,I didn't. Cherry.
veronica,Great bike.
veronica,I don't know. Should you?
veronica,Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
veronica," Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University."
veronica,It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
veronica,It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
david,"Throw your coats on the bed, girls."
whining student,That exam was so bogus.
coed one,Oh I know. Which exam?
david,"Veronica, this is Brad."
brad,Excellent. Did you girls bring your partying slippers?
heather chandler,"Yeah, let's party."
david,She loves to party.
brad,"So, are you a cheerleader?"
veronica," No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one."
veronica,"Gee, thanks."
brad,"It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask ""What's your major?"" I hate that."
brad,"So when you go to college, what kind of subjects do you think you'll study?"
heather chandler,"Come on David, let's go back to the party."
david," Don't worry, we will. You're just so hot tonight. I can't control myself."
brad,So what do you say we head up to my room and have a real party. I've got the best Windham Hill C.D. collection in the dorm.
brad,You're kidding. That pecker actually scored something on his own?
brad,"Excellent. Veronica, ever do cocaine?"
veronica,Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
brad,Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
veronica,"Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?"
brad,"Hey, don't run away now."
veronica,J.F.K.!
brad,"How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come on."
veronica,"Hey really, I don't feel so great."
brad,Let's do it on the coats. It'll be excellent.
veronica,"I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice...."
brad,Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
veronica,You don't deserve my fucking speech!
heather chandler,What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
veronica,"Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?"
heather chandler,No. Hell no.
heather chandler,You stupid cunt!
veronica,You goddamn bitch!
heather chandler,"You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!"
veronica,"Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up."
heather chandler," Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games."
veronica, S'okay....
veronica,Sure. But I'm Blue.
veronica,What a night.
veronica,"What a life. I almost moved into high school out of sixth grade because I was some genius. We all decided to chuck the idea because I'd have trouble making friends, blah-blah-blah."
veronica,Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
veronica,Killing her won't solve anything.
veronica,"Well then, I'll pray for rain."
veronica,"Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky."
veronica,There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm.
veronica,"I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die."
veronica,"But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out."
heather chandler,Bag that.
heather chandler,Lingo this.
veronica, Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
veronica,What about orange juice and milk? What's the upchuck factor on that?
veronica,Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her.
veronica,"O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?"
veronica,"What are you doing? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that."
veronica,"Just give me a cup, jerk."
veronica,Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
veronica,"No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely."
veronica,You're not funny.
veronica,Bonehead.
veronica,"Morning, Heather."
heather chandler,Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
veronica,"We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night."
heather chandler,Did we? How the hell'd you get in here?
heather chandler,Did you put a phlegm globber in it or something? I'm not drinking that piss.
heather chandler,Intense? Grow up. You think I'll drink it just because you call me chicken.
heather chandler,"Just give me the cup, jerk."
heather chandler,Corn nuts!
veronica,"No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend."
veronica,"Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna..."
veronica,Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
veronica,It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
veronica,Like a suicide thing?
veronica, I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
veronica,"""You might think what I've done is shocking..."""
veronica,"That's good, but Heather would never use the word ""myriad."""
veronica,"She missed ""myriad"" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?"
veronica,"You're probably right...""People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."""
veronica,That's good. Have you done this before?
principal gowan,Any other Principal would take the same position. Keep things business as usual.
counselor hyde,Heather Chandler's not your everyday suicide. She was very popular.
principal gowan,I let the kids go before lunch and the switchboard'll light up like a Christmas Tree.
kevin staples,"The parents will be sympathetic, sir. These are troubled times for the young."
pauline, I find it profoundly disturbing that we are told of a tragic destruction of youth and all we can talk about is adequate mourning times and misused vocabulary words.
principal gowan,Oh Christ.
pauline,"The school, meaning both students and teachers, must revel in this revealing moment. I suggest we get everyone into the cafeteria and just talk. And feel. Together."
principal gowan,"Thank you, Ms. Fleming. Call me when the shuttle lands...Now is this Heather the cheerleader?"
counselor hyde,That would be Heather Mcnamara.
principal gowan,Damn. I'd be willing to go half a day for a cheerleader.
kevin staples,Let's just pack it in an hour early.
principal gowan,Done. I hate Mondays.
pauline,I said a circle you imbeciles! Forget it! Just sit down. I'm just so thrilled to be given an example of everything I've taught you. That example is Heather Chandler. I have the note!
male student,All right!
pauline,I'll pass the suicide note around the room so you can feel its tragic beauty for yourself. Let us share together the feelings the suicide has spurred in us all. Who wants to begin?
female student,I heard it was really gnarly. She drank Liquid Plumber and Comet and stuff then she smashed....
pauline,"Now, now, we're not here to rehash the coroner's report. Let's talk emotions."
peter,"Heather and I used to go together, but she said I was boring. I realize now I wasn't really boring. She was just dissatisfied with her life."
pauline,That's very good Peter.
pauline,"Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share."
veronica,"Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness."
veronica,She realized the only way she could be happy was to give up her power and the only way she could do that was death.
heather mcnamara,"Oh God, it's so unfair. It's just so unfair! We should get a whole week off not just an hour."
heather duke,Write the School Board.
veronica,"Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food."
heather mcnamara,"Yeah, where's your urge to purge?"
heather duke, Fuck it.
heather mcnamara,"Look, heather left behind one of her Swatches. She'd want you to have it, Veronica. She always said you couldn't accessorize for shit."
heather duke,What a waste.
heather mcnamara,"Veronica, what are you doing?"
squealing girl,Everyone in the shower!
matt,Do I deliver or do I deliver?
rodney,"Hurry up, we're going to get caught."
matt,"Mellow out Geek. Man, I never should have brought you."
clyde,Let's see some pussy!
matt,Does this have something to do with menstrual cramps and shit?
clyde, What the fuck?
rodney,"We're on Candid Camera, dudes. I can feel it."
clyde,What the fuck?
steve,Do you deliver or do you deliver?
heather mcnamara,"That was seriously warped, Veronica."
veronica,Uh-huh.
heather duke,T.V. cameras!
heather mcnamara,"Oh God, Veronica. My hair! My clothes!"
veronica,"Next channel, darling."
veronica,"Oh, I have to hear this."
veronica, What are you smiling at?
veronica,Yeah. Scary stuff.
fred dean,"Hey Dad, how was work today?"
fred dean,It was miserable. Some damn tribe of withered old bitches doesn't want us to terminate that fleabag hotel. All because Glenn Miller and his band once took a shit there. It's just like Kansas. Do you remember fucking Kansas?
fred dean,"Fucking Kansas. Gosh Pop, I almost forgot to introduce my girlfriend."
veronica,Hello.
veronica, My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
veronica, Right.
dad,"Take a break Veronica, sit down."
veronica,All right.
dad,So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
veronica,"I don't know, it was okay, I guess."
mom,Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
veronica,Maybe.
dad, Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
veronica, Because you're an idiot.
dad,"Oh yeah, that's it."
mom, You two....
veronica,"Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow."
father ripper, It's Jesus Christ and he's in the book.
heather mcnamara,Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
veronica,Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
heather mcnamara,"Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date."
veronica,"Heather, I've got something going with J.D."
heather mcnamara,"Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it."
kurt,We on tonight man?
ram,"I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?"
kurt,Pretty weird.
kurt,That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
ram,Let's kick his ass.
kurt,"Cool off, we're seniors."
ram,Goddamn Geek!
braces, Sit and spin.
kurt,That little prick.
kurt,"All right you piece of shit fag, do you like to suck big dicks?"
braces,Cut it out!
kurt,Say it man. Say I like to suck big dicks.
rodney,"Leave him alone, Kurt."
braces,"Okay, okay, you like to suck big dicks."
braces,I like to suck big dicks. Mmm-mm! I can't get enough of them. Satisfied?
kurt,"I'm sure your friends are happy to hear that.  Right, guys?"
heather mcnamara,"Don't worry, Ram's been so sweet lately, consoling me and stuff. It'll be really very. Promise."
veronica,"All right, but I hope it isn't going to be one of those nights where they get shitfaced and take us to a pasture to tip cows."
kurt,"Is it sleeping, dude?"
ram,"I think so, man."
kurt,"Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest."
ram,Punch it in!
kurt,"Count of three, guy."
kurt,"""When I get that feeling, I need sexual healing....."""
veronica,"Yeah, right, asshole."
veronica,I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
kurt," ""Feel like making bah da dah bah da dah, feel like making love."""
veronica,"So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!"
kurt,"""And she's buying the stairway to heaven.."""
dennis,"I'm not belittling the Famine Fund Peter, but we're talking teen suicide! Westerburg finally got one and I'm not going to blow it."
peter,Great. Heather gets the headline and I get crammed in by the Taco Bell coupon.
veronica,Hi Guys. I came to check on this week's lunchtime poll topic.
dennis,"Don't worry about it, Veronica, sit down. That funeral yesterday must have been really rough."
veronica,Oh. Sure.
yearbook girl,"We were, uh, wondering if maybe you had some poems or artwork that Heather did that we could put in the Heather Chandler yearbook spread?"
veronica,The what?
yearbook girl,Take a look. We'll have a two page layout with her suicide note up here in the right hand corner.
dennis,It's more tasteful than it sounds.
veronica,I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
courtney,"Like last night, Veronica?"
veronica,I'm sorry? I don't get it.
courtney,You did last night.
courtney's friend,Kurt told us of your little date.
veronica,Yeah. And? I left him drunk and flailing in cowshit.
courtney,I don't know. He was really detailed.
peter,"Shut up, Courtney."
veronica,Don't shut up. I'd like to know just what I did.
peter," Let me show you that lunchtime poll topic, Veronica."
peter,I rarely listen to Neanderthals like Kurt Kelly bu-ut he said you were bent over like a coffee table with Kurt going in one end and Ram coming in the other. Pardon the pun.
veronica, Pardon the pun. Son-of-a-bitch.
veronica,"Thanks Pete, for the Famine Fund."
veronica,"Hi, Kurt? This is Veronica Sawyer. I didn't expect to be calling either. I guess my emotions took over. I was wondering if you wanted all those things you've been saying to really happen. It's always been a fantasy of mine to have two guys at once...... Sure, you can write Penthouse Forum."
veronica,"That's right, tonight. In the woods behind the school. Don't forget Ram."
kurt,Women.
veronica,I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
veronica,"You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over."
veronica,French.
veronica,So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
veronica,First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
veronica,Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
veronica,"We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it was World War Two, not a school play."
veronica,Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
veronica,Oh.
veronica,You must have had fun.
veronica,Oh come on. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
veronica," Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?"
ram, Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
kurt,"Shut the fuck up, all right."
ram,"Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!"
kurt,Hi Veronica.
veronica, Hi Guys. Glad you could make it.
ram,So do we just start fucking?
veronica,"I've made a circle on each end of the clearing. Ram, you come over here."
veronica,"When you get in the circle, strip."
ram,What about you?
veronica,"I was hoping you'd rip my clothes off me, sport."
ram,Oh. Good idea.
veronica,"Count of three, guys."
veronica,One.
veronica,Two.
veronica,Shucks.
veronica," Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on...."
milner,I heard it that time!
milner,Another gunshot! From the woods!
veronica,Kurt doesn't look too good.
milner,Call in!
milner,I heard something out there. I'm checking it out.
milner,Think what I heard was just a stinking owl. All I got is two kids making out in the backseat of a car. Should I pry them apart?
milner,What's the deal?
milner,That's Kurt Kelly!
milner,"Oh my God, suicide? Why?"
milner,"Oh man, they were fags!"
milner,Ah Jesus H. Fuck. Kurt was a Parade magazine Honorable Mention...
milner,Wait a second. How did they shoot each other if we heard two separate sets of gunshots?
milner,Oh the humanity.
kevin staples," After every touchdown or whatever, they give each other a little slap on the bottom. It seems innocent..."
pauline,"Will you shut up! We were in a similar position Monday and I thoughtfully suggested that we get the students together for an unadulterated emotional outpouring. You took the suggestion as an opportunity to play yet another round of ""Let's laugh at the Hippie."""
counselor hyde,"Pauline, if you want a tryout for the school play...."
principal gowan,"Shut up, Paul. I've seen a lot of bullshit--angel dust, switchblades, sexually perverse photography exhibits involving tennis racquets, but this suicide thing....I guess it's all on Pauline's wavelength. We're just going to write off today, and Friday she can do her little little love-in or whatever. Whatever."
veronica,"We killed them, didn't we?"
veronica,Ich Luge bullets! I'm an idiot!
veronica,I did not want them dead.
veronica,Did not.
veronica,Did not.
heather duke,"Ah, young love."
squeeling girl,Did you hear? School's cancelled today because Kurt and Ram killed themselves in a repressed homosexual suicide pact.
heather duke, No way!
veronica, Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
veronica,Your son's dead and you love him.
mom,How was the funeral?
veronica, Superb.
veronica,That's three things.
veronica,"No, it's okay J.D., I just kind of wanted to talk.....Oh, a newsmagazine show on Channel 16. Really? On the suicides. No, sounds great. Bye."
pauline,"Peter, kill the jukebox."
pauline,Could I have your attention?
pauline,Our school has been torn apart by tragedy. I'm here today to fuse it back together through love! I want everyone to clasp hands. We need to connect this cafeteria into one mighty circuit. Let's begin a new happiness!
pauline,"Yo, what's the problem? I know you know how to hold hands. Ring-around- the-rosy-a-pocketful-of-posy...Forget it! I'm just so thrilled to announce that Whitney James of WETC News is taping a rap session with students from area high schools including Westerburg."
pauline,"Let's show the world Westerburg is a diverse happy home, not Suicide Central!  You know there's some people who say Westerburg is too weak and wimpy a school to be on T.V. Is that true?"
pauline,No or Hell No?
students, Hell no!
pauline,I can't hear you....
students,HELL NO!
veronica,Can't you see this is a special moment?
pauline,You people are in charge of getting delegates from every clique in the school to be on the Whitney James Teenage Suicide Prevention T.V. Special. Let's be able to say we were the ones who put peer pressure out to pasture.
peter,Westerburg? A happy family?
pauline,I'm sure you'll work something out.
heather duke, Don't worry. We'll work something out.
veronica,Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
veronica,"You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience."
veronica,Don't even talk about that stuff!
veronica,You can be so immature!
fred dean,We beat the bitches.
veronica, Oh beautiful. The Beaver's home.
fred dean,Judge told em to slurp shit and die.
fred dean,"I put a Norwegian in the boiler room. Masterful. When that blew, it set off a pack of thermals I'd stuck upstairs."
fred dean,It's great to be alive!
veronica,Do you like your father?
veronica,Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...
veronica,Maybe.
bigfun,TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT! TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
veronica,We're breaking up. I am out!
veronica,"You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you."
veronica,I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
heather duke,What the.....
heather duke, Where did you get these?
heather duke,What do you want from me?
heather duke,But she couldn't handle it.
heather duke,Very very. The photographs?
earl,"Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is."
veronica, Something like that. Will you do it?
earl,"Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd."
veronica,I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
earl,"I don't get treated at all, but hey, don't worry about it. I'll do your thing. It'll give my Mom a smile."
veronica,"Things are going to change, Earl."
earl,Uh-huh.
heather duke,Guess who?
veronica,Heather.
veronica,"Ouch. Your machine's got the most obnoxious beep. Heather, I'm sorry."
david,"Hey Veronica Sawyer, barf on anybody's carpet lately?"
veronica,Is this David? Heather's David? What are you doing....
david,What can I say? I was pretty broken up by Heather C.'s suicide. I needed somebody super-sensitive like Heather D.
veronica,I'm delirious for the both of you. Can you put Heather on?
david,She can't really talk right now.
veronica,"Hello, Betty....."
betty,I don't believe it. I'm winning.
veronica,"Don't get cocky, girl."
betty,"I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends."
veronica,That's bullshit. Just shoot.
betty,"Ronnie, I'm still a virgin."
veronica, Shoot.
veronica,"Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked."
betty,Ronnie!
betty,"Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way."
veronica,"It's not my style, okay?"
betty,Nice guys finish last. I should know.
heather duke,Brav-o!
betty finn," I've got to get going, Veronica. See you at the studio."
veronica,Sure. See ya.
heather mcnamara,Croquet won't be the same without Heather.
heather duke,"Oh Betty, wait. I almost forgot...The Whitney James Teenage Suicide Prevention T.V. Special isn't going to be taped at the studios. It's going to be done in the Park."
betty,But I thought...
heather duke," It's going to be like a big picnic. Bring some potato salad...HEY, I'M RED!"
heather mcnamara,Shit.
veronica,So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
heather duke,"Back off. I called everyone, even that Stoner slut. Felt like giving my phone a bath. I told Betty just now...Damn!"
veronica,"You're so polluted. Talking down to people, making fake notes...."
heather duke,"I don't see what gives you the right to lecture, Ronnie. You were soulmates with Betty Finn until you realized you're the cover of Seventeen magazine and she's the before half of a Scarsdale Diet ad."
heather duke,Some people just don't matter. Why should those who do carry their weight? Am I right?
veronica,"No, you're wrong. It's not even your turn."
heather mcnamara,"She's right.....Boy, croquet's not the same without Heather."
veronica,Ich Luge bullets. I'm such a jerk.
peter dawson,"Veronica, I thought we lost you."
veronica,I was waiting for my friend Betty.
peter dawson,Teens talking it out on T.V.! Would it be pretentious of me to attach a videocassette of the show on my Princeton application?
veronica,"Shucks, that's a great idea, Pete."
peter dawson,"This is excellent, but I thought we were going to get equal representation on this thind: Geeks, Gearheads..."
heather duke,They're probably just being fashionably late.
heather duke,"Is this very or what? Oh, you've gotta meet Whitney James! Come on!"
heather duke,"Whitney, here's my friend....."
whitney james,Ah please sit down.
whitney james,"I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too."
veronica,But my name's not...
whitney james,"People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?"
veronica,I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
whitney james,"Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up."
whitney james,"I'm not knocking teen suicide. It's exciting stuff. My personal faves are those kids from loaded families grabbing the mike to whine how even though they bagged a B.M.W. on their birthday, they're still quote-unquote depressed. It's ridiculous. People who say money can't buy happiness don't know where to shop."
clyde,What the fuck?
veronica,"The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness."
whitney james,"Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda."
veronica,"It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up."
whitney james,Sure. Ciao.
pauline,Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
veronica,"But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right."
pauline,"What, the wine? I realize you're all under 21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch.  Could we get some more light up here?"
pauline,Our schools have been torn apart by tragedy. Let's fuse them back together through love. Let's clasp hands and connect ourselves in one mighty circuit like a dove.
pauline,...with no more suicide...
students, Oh yeah...
pauline,No more problems....
veronica,Oh yeah.
whitney james,Let's go for another take.
cashier,Bargain matinees are for the first show only.
martha,"Oh, I forgot."
dad,"Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?"
veronica,"Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep."
mom,"I don't know what you're talking about, honey, but can it wait a bit. We're watching this special program on Teen Problems."
mom,Turn that back on!
veronica,"This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life."
dad,"If we're not going to watch that program, can I put on the game?"
mom,Are you trying to tell me it is not a troubled time for the nation's youth?
veronica,Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
mom,"I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?"
veronica,"All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized."
dad,I don't patronize bunny rabbits.
mom,"Treated like human beings? Is that what you said little Miss Voice of a Generation? Just how do you think adults act with other adults? You think it's all just Doubles Tennis. Adults can be horrible to other adults. When teenagers complain that they want to be treated like human beings, it's usually because they are being treated like human beings."
veronica,I guess I picked the wrong time to be a human being.
mom,You'll live. Want some pate?
heather duke,"Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car."
veronica, Is she dead?
heather duke,"That's the punchline. She's still alive, in stable condition. Another case of a geek trying to imitate the popular people of the school and failing miserably. Is that pate?"
veronica,I said I was sorry.
heather duke,"You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers."
veronica,You're not funny. Ouch!
heather duke, What. A. Martyr. Understand; Martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. Just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.
veronica,Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
heather duke,"Oh shit, yeah."
heather duke,This sounds like a good one.
heather mcnamara,"My name is Heather, I mean, not Heather."
heather mcnamara,"It's Madonna. Geez, no, not that."
heather mcnamara,"God has cursed me, I think. The last time I had sex, the guy killed himself the next day. I'm failing Math."
gruff teacher,Where's Heather going?
heather duke,She's going to cry-y-y.
heather mcnamara,Fucking child protector caps.
gruff teacher,Now where's she going? Is somebody getting raped today on All My Children or what?
heather mcnamara,Give me a break.
heather mcnamara,What are you trying to do? Kill me?
veronica,What were you trying to do? Sleep?
heather mcnamara,Suicide is a private thing.
veronica,You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
heather mcnamara,But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
veronica,"If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?"
heather mcnamara,Probably....
veronica,"Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host."
heather mcnamara,Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
veronica,Sure.
heather duke,TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
heather duke,"I'll get right on it coach. And hey, a little gift. I won't be needing it."
courtney,Oh great. Here comes Heather.
courtney's friend,Shit.
heather duke,"Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten everyone to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!"
veronica,People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
heather duke," Hey, just sign the petition!"
veronica,Don't talk to me like that.
heather duke,It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
veronica, No.
heather duke,Jealous much?
veronica,"Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?"
heather duke,"Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made her Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!"
veronica, I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
veronica,"It's over, J.D.  Over!"
veronica,Yes?
mom,Your friend Jason Dean just stopped by. He seemed very concerned about you. He said he thinks you might try to kill yourself.
dad,"You have been depressed lately. Oh, he said this is for you."
veronica,Oh my God....
veronica,"Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!"
veronica,Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
veronica,You're still not listening! I'm not..
veronica, This knife is filthy.
veronica,"I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless."
veronica,"Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note."
veronica,No-o!
father ripper,Eskimo.
father ripper,"Heather Duke underlined a lot of things in this copy of The Catcher in the Rye, but I believe the word Eskimo, underlined all by itself is the key to understanding Heather's pain."
father ripper,"On the surface, Heather Duke was the vivacious young lady we all knew her to be. But her soul was in Antartica, freezing with the knowledge of the way fellow teenagers can be cruel, the way parents can be unresponsive, and as she writes so eloquently in her suicide note, the way life can suck. We'll all miss Sherwood's little Eskimo. Let's hope she's rubbing noses with Jesus."
heather chandler,Is this turnout weak or what? I had at least seventy more people at my funeral.
veronica,Heather? Wha...
heather chandler,"Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing ""Kumbaya"" one more time..."
veronica,What are you doing here?!
heather chandler,I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
heather chandler,Dinner!
mom,Does she want a written invitation?  Veronica! Dinner!
mom,Honey?
mom,"Oh God, I knew it! No, no! I want my baby back! I should have let you keep that job at the mall. I was just afraid of you coming home alone at night!"
mom,I made your favorite! Spaghetti! Lots of oregano!
veronica,"Hey Mom, why so tense?"
pauline,Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
veronica,Where is he? Where's J.D.?
pauline,We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
veronica,Get a job.
veronica,"Rodney, where's everybody going?"
rodney,It's Friday.....
veronica,"Oh my God, the damn pep assembly...."
rodney,"Yeah, these things are pretty artificial, but at least we all get out of class..."
veronica,"Rodney, what's underneath the gym?"
rodney,The boiler room.
veronica,"Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground."
veronica,"Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head."
veronica,"The bomb's gone on, J.D.! How do you turn it off? Tell me!"
veronica,"It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it."
veronica,How do you turn the fucker off?
veronica,"The bomb, asshole!"
veronica,"You know what I want, babe?"
veronica,Cool guys like you out of my life.
veronica,"But babe, don't worry, these here were Ich Luge bullets."
veronica, I thought I...you..
veronica,Perfecto.
heather duke,"Veronica, you look like hell."
veronica,"Yeah, I just got back."
heather duke,What are you doing?
veronica,"Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town."
veronica,"Hey, Martha, wait up."
veronica,"My date for the prom kind of flaked out on me, so I thought if you weren't doing anything that night we could go to the video store and rent some new releases or something. Maybe pop some popcorn."
martha,I'd like that.
veronica,So would I.
