Speaker,Dialogue
charlie,"Excuse me sir, can we help you?  Did you miss your ride?"
jacob,I missed the Spec.
russ,The what?
charlie,"Yes, I'm afraid you did. Can we call someone for you?"
russ,He's seriously old.
charlie,Did you come with the folks from the retirement home?
jacob,"No, I came on my own."
jacob,"No, I told ya, I came on my own and I'm not going back. Get your hands off me."
russ, It's OK. We're gonna call the home so they can come pick you up.
russ,Woah! The language. Uncalled for.
charlie,"Sir, we need to get you out of this parking lot. My trucks have to come through here. Please... He offers the wheelchair. Jacob relents and sits."
jacob,"In my day, they had old timers in the ticket wicket and freaks like him in the sideshow. Damn kid didn't even know what the Spec was."
charlie,"You sound like you know circuses. Charlie checks his watch, impatient to get Jacob home."
jacob,I should. I was on two.
charlie," Two circuses. Wow, that's something."
jacob,"Ringling, of course, but that was later..."
charlie,I'll need your name when I call the home.
jacob,...First one was called Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show ... Charlie suddenly stops upon hearing that name.
charlie,What?...Wait a minute! Did you say you were with the Benzini Brothers?
charlie,"""31?...You're saying you were there for the---?"
jacob,I was in the middle of it.
jacob,I remember it like yesterday... Better - cause I don't remember yesterday.
jacob,Jacob Jankowski the only.
charlie,"Mr. Jankowski, I would be honored if you would have a drink with me in my trailer."
jacob," Ah, I remember you...Camel would've loved this stuff."
charlie,"Camels drink scotch? Jacob laughs, shaking his head No. Charlie pours another;"
jacob,The Great Escape! But I got lost.
charlie,"I should call the home, let them know where you are."
jacob,"I don't know why they call it a ""home"". You don't know anybody there. They fill you so full of drugs, you don't care...Five kids and not one has a place for me since their mother died. They take turns visiting me on weekends. They forgot whose turn it was today so nobody showed up.."
charlie,"So, how did the Benzini Brothers stampede start? The story is two guys got thrown off the train and--"
jacob,No point in telling a story if all you want to know is the end.
charlie,Sorry. From the beginning.
jacob,"Now, let's see...the beginning... Well, everything began the same day everything ended...Ha, isn't that how it always works?..."
the proctor,"You may begin. Jacob, the Blonde and fifty other students open their exam booklets and begin under The PROCTOR's supervision."
the proctor,"Mr. Jankowski? May we have a word? Fifty pairs of eyes turn to look at Jacob, who looks up."
dean wilkins,"Jacob, it's your parents. I'm afraid there's been a car accident."
coroner,"Are you ready? The Chaplain places a comforting hand on Jacob's shoulder. Jacob nods. The Coroner exposes first Jacob's father, then Jacob's mother. We see only Jacob's expression:"
chaplain,Is there any other family to call?
jacob,No. Just me.
hyde,"I know this is difficult for you, but there's been no mistake. The house and all their assets, including your father's practise, are now property of the bank in default of the mortgage."
jacob,"But I'm telling you, my father put away every penny he ever earned. They owned that house outright. Why would he have a mortgage?"
hyde,"My guess is because he let people pay him in beans & eggs or whatever they had, instead of money."
jacob,And so he's penalized for not turning away people who couldn't afford his help? He was a doctor.
hyde,"Yes, I know, he was a very good man but in banking terms, in the reality of what makes this world actually function, he was an irresponsible man. I'm sorry, but you oughta to know the truth. This Depression is going to last for a long while.."
bank representative,"This just came for you, Jacob. Whatever it is I'm going to have to include in the bank's report of assets. Sorry. You OK?"
bank representative,"Jacob? Jacob they need these signed by the end of the business day. Jacob walks away from the Bank Rep, pulling off his tie and tossing it. He is crying - the reality finally hitting him."
blackie,"We don't need no bums on this train brother. You can get off right now and keep running. Old Timer rises with a lantern and hobbles on one bad leg, inspects Jacob and his nice suit with the lantern..."
old timer,Now everybody calm down here. Grady put that damn rifle away. BLACKIE LET'IM GO...And I mean on the inside of the train! Jacob struggles as Blackie pins one arm behind him.
jacob,Jacob. Jankowski. Nice to meet you.
camel,You're pretty young for the rails. You running from something boy? You on the lam?
jacob,No. Nothing like that.
camel,Where you headed?
jacob,I don't know.
camel,Hungry? Outta work?
jacob,About anything I guess.
camel,"We land in Deposit in the morning. We'll find you some work. And if you're still alive by the end of it, I'll get you some food and take you to Uncle August. Jacob drinks and chokes on the liquor."
jacob,Who's that?
grady,August Rosenbluth...Lord and Master of the Known and Unknown Universes. Ringmaster Extraordinaire. Jacob looks baffled. Camel laughs as he drinks more;
camel,"Oh kid, don't tell me you didn't notice? Grady and Bill laugh though Blackie remains un-amused."
bill,"Ha, he really don't know."
camel,"HA! You didn't just jump a train boy. You jumped the Flying Squadron of the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth... You done landed your ass on a circus, kid! PRE-LAP: The Circus Train brakes screeching to a halt!"
jacob,What is it? What do you want? The Orangutan strains its arm. Blinking at him. Pointing. Jacob looks around and sees A HALF SQUASHED ORANGE on the ground in front of the cage. He picks it up. Jacob opens the den and hands the Orangutan the orange. She takes it and sets it on the floor of her den. She returns and reaches out for Jacob again.
camel,Gonna try to get you set up with Crazy Joe.
jacob,Do I call him Crazy Joe?
camel,"It has been said Crazy Joe went to prison for killing a man who spit into the wind and hit the back of Joe's neck. So no, I would not call this man Crazy Joe to his face. Camel and Jacob walks on to an open stock car door, where CRAZY JOE stands - a burly man, missing three fingers."
jacob,I've never seen so much manure!
wade,Baggage stock horses. They pack'em in 27 a car.
jacob,How do you stand the smell?
wade,What smell?
wade,"When Cecil gives the signal ya gotta push the rubes in towards the entrance but without them catching on or else they'll be a fight. Jacob, Wade and the other men position themselves equidistant around the perimeter of the crowd facing Cecil."
grady,Stand inside the tent and smack the sides with this when you see a head trying to peek in without paying. Jacob follows Grady into the tent...
jacob,"Excuse me, ma'am? Hi. I'm Jacob. Marlena doesn't respond. She looks at him with suspicion."
camel,"You like the food? You deserve it. You done good, I hear.."
jacob,But it's the middle of the night.
camel,Only time circus people live - when they don't have to work. Come on...
camel,"I got a son about your age. Lives outside of Reading, PA. Haven't seen him for years. Fix your shirt there. Jacob shoves in his shirt. Camel smiles. He likes the kid. - The Clown Car: Clowns without make-up reading or playing cards. They look at Jacob as if he were walking the last mile. One Clown waves goodbye."
barbara,"How's your pipe, kid? Camel leads the slack-jawed Jacob away."
camel,Night ladies.
jacob,Hey Camel - who's that woman who works the horses?
jacob,Wife? Camel takes this opportunity to drink some Jake and ask:
camel,"Look, kid, before we do this, I gotta ask... ..I ain't tryin to know your business but I do know you ain't been on the road too long. You're too clean, your clothes too nice and you don't got a possession on you. See, a man on the road collects little things. It's not a big life I can tell ya. So before you start, I ask: if you got any kind of life to go back to, that's what you should do."
jacob,"I don't. Camel studies him, as if understanding what isn't said."
camel,I am sorry to hear that. They move on.
camel,"This here's Earl. He's gonna take you in. Earl, this here's Jacob."
jacob, I don't know how to thank you.
camel,"HA! You may not want to after you been on a show long as I have. Good luck to ya, kid. Camel exits OS. Alone with Earl, Jacob asks:"
jacob,Do I look OK?
earl,"Very nice. Then, with one hand Earl slides back the door and with the other hand, violently grabs Jacob by the neck and throws him head first into the car."
august,What's this?
earl,That stowaway the old drunk took under his wing. College boy. Jacob tries to explain but Earl bangs him against the wall.
august, I'll see your three and raise you five...
jacob,"Jacob Jankowski, sir."
august,"And what is a ""Jacob Jankowski"" and why he is on my train?"
jacob,"Just looking for work, sir."
jacob,No sir.
august,"Ever worked a show, son?"
jacob,No sir.
august,Ever been to a show?
jacob,"Yes sir... Jacob, sensing where this is going, gets August's attention;"
august,"Ringling, you say?"
jacob,Yes. But it was terrible.
august,Really? Have you seen our show?
jacob,The uh...the one with the black and white horses. And the girl in pink.
august,"Ah, our Star Attraction. Well, I believe we're looking for a boy to carry water for the elephants, aren't we Diamond Joe?"
diamond joe,We don't have an eleph-
august,Shut-up.
jacob,"I would do that, sir. I'd like to work with the animals. August and the others chuckle. Jacob doesn't understand why. August crosses to Jacob, as he ridicules:"
august,"And you'd carry water for elephants? Ha, ha...you have any idea how much water an elephant drinks, kid? College! Pfft! Never met a college man yet who knew his own ass from shinola."
jacob,"Times are hard for everybody...And I guess because ... out of all the dirt and sweat and shit and working with fellas you don't want to be caught dead meeting in the daylight, comes...so much beauty. We think August and the men are moved by Jacob's words."
august,That's beautifully put.
crazy joe,I got no use for people who rhyme.
jacob, It was veterinary science! And I can tell you one thing - that Star Attraction horse of yours won't be walking in a few days let alone performing center ring!! August stops and turns.
august,Earl wait!
jacob,Cornell.
diamond joe,Marlena did want a vet to take a look at Silver Star. They cost.
cecil,He worked the rubes for me this afternoon. Pretty good.
crazy joe,He shovelled horse shit. Don't make him a horse doctor. August looks reluctant. Until Jacob caps it:
jacob,"I hear Ringling has its own vet. The other men can't believe Jacob spoke up like this. But it amuses August, who faces him and smiles;"
august,"All right, Cornell. Come with me. August leads Jacob out."
august,"Are you sure-footed, Jacob Jankowski?"
jacob,I believe so.
august,"Good. Without missing a beat, August leans forward, catches hold of something around the side of the car and disappears."
august,"It's a breath taking sight, isn't it? Always gets me."
august,Kinko.
august,This is Jacob. He's going to bunk with you a while.
jacob,How do you do?
august,I said his name is Jacob.
august,He's going to help out in the menagerie.
august,Well there are performers.. (his hand indicates high
jacob,A Jack Russell. They're very smart.
camel,"Ha, this gam of mine keeps falling asleep on me. Pretty soon the only place for me is going to be selling tickets but I'm too ugly for that."
jacob,See ya Camel.
camel," Yeah, take care kid."
august,You'll need new clothes too. I'll set you up with the Monday Man.
jacob,Monday Man?
august,What day of the week did your mother hang out the wash to dry?
august,"It's the Depression, Cornell. Where have you been? Oh right - Cornell. Kinko is bathing with his two buckets when August snatches one of them away."
jacob,"August, it's all right, I'll--"
jacob,"August.. When August stops, Jacob is caught off guard..."
august,The horse. August wants Jacob to follow him to the horse. Jacob thought he was going to bathe.
jacob,Oh! Yes...The horse. Jacob follows behind August's commanding stride.
august,"I'm sure it's nothing serious. Don't tell my wife I said this but she coddles them too much. She has a particularly strong affection for Silver Star. I don't encourage it. It's unhealthy to love an animal that much...Here she is. Marlena runs up to them, still in her bed clothes/robe."
jacob,It's a pleasure to meet you. Marlena barely acknowledges Jacob - keeping their previous meeting a secret . August puts his arm around her and they kiss.
august,"Last stall. Lead the way, doc. They enter the ring stock car..."
august,"Jesus, Marlena, he wasn't this bad in the show. Jacob moves to examine the horse, but he flinches in pain. Marlena takes over, by sitting besides Silver Star's head, and stroking his head while singing a soft lullaby. Jacob registers Marlena's soothing effect causes Silver Star to relax...his breathing grows calmer. So Jacob begins to examine him as Marlena watches protectively. Jacob runs his right hand down the leg to the fetlock. He lays his hand on the hoof then place his thumb and forefinger on the back of the fetlock. He looks at the sole of the hoof, which is bulging and dark with a red line around the edge. Jacob's expression tells us this is a bad sign."
jacob,Not yet.
august,"Well, how are you going to fix it? Marlena looks at him coolly, expecting an explanation. Jacob doesn't want to tell her the truth. Jacob looks to August and rises, leaving Marlena with the horse. Jacob pulls August away to whisper."
jacob,I didn't want to say anything in front of... Mrs. Rosenbluth...he's already foundering.
august,English.
jacob,"This horse isn't getting back on his feet, August. If there was anything I could do, I would but we're going to have to put him down...I'm real sorry. Beat. August's stares at Jacob - or rather, stares through him. A dead stare that lasts just a beat or two too long...And then just as suddenly, the look is gone:"
august,I know you are. Come with me. August exits. Jacob doesn't know what this means. He follows.
august,"Joe, bad report for Silver Star I'm afraid. Jacob here says there's no hope. We're going to have to put him down... Diamond Joe registers a concerned, anxious look to Jacob."
diamond joe,A harness what?
august,Jacob and I'll take care of the cats. We'll meet you back at the stall.
jacob,"August, this stuff has gone off. Do the cats really eat this?"
august,"No, they really love goats.  We're all out of goats."
august,"Go ahead. They get a bucket each. Apprehensive, Jacob hops up. August hands him the buckets."
jacob,"What do I do, just open the door and toss it in?"
august,"Unless you think a formal sit-down is appropriate. Jacob approaches the tiger first. The six hundred pound cat rises then roars, his massive head hitting the cage and rattling the lose padlock. Jacob freezes."
jacob,What the hell is wrong with you? You think that's funny?
jacob,FUN! I could have lost my arm!
jacob,"I don't know how he's been performing August, but you don't have a Star Act now. That horse can't walk and if he does you'll lose him. He's in a lot of pain."
august,Like this? August squeezes Jacob's sore arm from Rex's attack. Jacob cries out in pain as August holds his grip yet speaks calmly;
marlena,"Tell me the truth. What's wrong with him? Jacob hesitates before answering, then:"
jacob,"The connective tissues between the hoof and the coffin bone are compromised and the coffin bone rotates toward the sole of the hoof. If he keeps walking, it'll puncture through...He's in a lot of pain."
marlena,And if he rests?
jacob,"You'll lose him anyway. I'm sorry. Marlena breaths in this bad news and braces herself, tears welling up in her eyes."
marlena,Then you have to put him down. Jacob is impressed by her...and a little surprised.
jacob,It's the right thing to do.
marlena,But August won't let you.
jacob," If I'm the show's vet then it's my decision, isn't it?"
marlena,But August won't like it.
jacob,Then it'll be my last decision. Marlena is impressed by Jacob. And surprised. She doesn't quite know what to make of him.
camel,Hey kid. What are you doing on the wrong side of the tracks?
jacob,I need a gun.
camel,It can't be that bad... They laugh but Jacob insists boldly.
jacob,"I need a gun! Or a rifle! Now! Grady leans inside the open car door and gets him a rifle. Jacob takes it and marches back. They watch him, curiously. Jacob passes Blackie on the way and boldly ignores his intimidating stance....Performers and workmen sense a drama brewing and follow Jacob to see what is happening."
kinko,What do you think you're doing?
jacob,Shut-up! Both of you! Jacob continues on to Silver Star and Marlena.
marlena,"No. I'll keep him calm. Jacob respects Marlena's fortitude...Jacob raises the rifle and aims, trembling...Stoic Marlena, tears in her eyes, turns her face away...Jacob pauses, upset...then...shoots."
jacob,"Friends now? August calmly enters the menagerie with the rifle. He walks to the center and stops, staring at Jacob. Jacob goes about caring for the animals - moving from one to the next - trying not to be unnerved by August's presence. Then August does a surprising thing: He sits in the center of the menagerie, crossed legged, with the rifle beside him."
august,You've got a gift for them. Like Marlena with horses. It's God- given. I can always spot it. Jacob takes Bobo out of his den. Bobo hugs him tightly. He continues on as he replies;
jacob,My father used to say that to me.
august,He must have been a wise man.
jacob,"How is Marlena? August tilts his head curiously, with a smile."
august,"You're a genuine curiosity Jacob Jankowski. What am I to do with you? ... I threaten to throw you off a moving train, feed you to my lions and you go ahead and shoot my star horse anyway. So I think - Jacob's an educated man. For Jacob to disobey me and shoot that horse, that horse must have been in pretty bad shape. Perhaps bad enough to injure my Marlena during the show. And so I think Jacob Jankowski might be a valuable person to have around."
jacob,Tell Diamond Joe the animals need more water when the humidity's this bad if I don't see him before I go.
august,You're not going anywhere. You belong here. These animals..they've been waiting for you. Jacob doesn't know whether to believe him or not. Then:
jacob,"What problem? August lights, inhales, blows smoke then:"
august,"The cats. You see, meat eaters are always more valuable to a circus than hay burners. And you saw what we had to feed them."
jacob,What does Silver Star have to do with the cats?
august,"We should have just enough food for them to get us to the next show, thanks to you. Of course Marlena won't speak to me for a day or two but she'll come around...So, I was right. You are a valuable man. As he walks away, rifle over his arm, Jacob is unnerved;"
jacob,"August, what did you do? August?"
jacob,Why are we stopping?
kinko,August loves his sideshow freaks. There's a guy with this outfit who has a parasitic twin growing out of his chest. He dresses it in a tiny tuxedo and black patent leather shoes. No talent but a real money- maker with the rubes. Calls himself the Man and a Half. Goddamn August'll pay him double what he pays me just for the irony.
jacob,What happened to this circus?
kinko,Went belly up. Pretty common nowadays. Circus bosses see the end coming and they'd pull a runner with all the money. Menagerie belongs to the town now. August can get anything he wants for a song. Jacob and Kinko watch August striding through the grounds as desperate performers hopeful for work rush up to him.
august,We have a new star!
diamond joe,The Man and a Half?
august,"Nah, lousy Ringling got here first. But we got better! A bull!"
jacob,A bull?
august,"A bull elephant! Her name is Rosie, she's fifty-three and she's brilliant. The best bull they had. I'm going to come up with a whole new Star Act around her and Marlena.."
crazy joe,Just for the elephant! But the bunkers are at capacity! I've got roustabouts three to a bunk. August tosses off this concern.
august,"We'll find places for everyone. And when our new star sells tickets, we'll buy another car! We're a show to be reckoned with now!"
jacob,She has such long eye lashes.
diamond joe,She's a hundred if she's a day. We're lucky if she can move.
august,"Darling, what do you think? She's magnificent, isn't she? Marlena keeps her rage silent, but it is all the more potent. August decides to ignore it. Jacob keeps his eyes on Rosie but feels the tension between them. ROSIE'S CARETAKER approaches: filthy shirt behind suspenders."
rosie's caretaker,You the bull man?
august,No.  This is my menagerie man.
rosie's caretaker,"Where's your bull man? Ya got no bull man, I gotta tell the township or else they can't sell her to ya. August grabs Jacob's arm and shoves him forward;"
august,"Here he is. He's my bull man.. Rosie's Caretaker looks at the surprised Jacob, then:"
rosie's caretaker,All right. See this animal...this here's the stupidest Goddamn animal on the face of God's good earth....Here's your bull hook. You're gonna need it. He tosses A BULL HOOK - a wooden rod about three feet long with a four inch metal pick coming off the end - to Jacob.
august,I don't believe it. The mayor said she was the best bull you had.
rosie's caretaker,"If she was the best bull, why is she the only one left? You think you're the first show to turn up picking on the bones? August is annoyed. As the Caretaker gathers his things:"
august,"Joe, you and Greg come with me. We have to find a car to renovate."
jacob,"Mrs. Rosenbluth, I hope I'm not speaking out of turn here but - but I had no idea they were going to do that to Silver Star."
marlena,"I know....Thank you. This relaxes Jacob, but he senses she is still sad."
jacob,"Hello Rosie, I'm Jacob Jankowski. This is Mrs. Marlena Rosenbluth. Can you say Mrs. Marlena Rosenbluth? Marlena smiles as she watches Jacob stroke Rosie's hide."
marlena,"I think you two are engaged. They laugh. Jacob is thrilled to have this effect on Marlena. A HARMONICA PLAYS A TUNE in the distance. They turn towards the sound and see that the two of them are alone in the tent. All the workmen have left. Jacob and Marlena turn back to Rosie who stands between them. There is a awkward, lovely moment of intimacy between the three as Marlena strokes Rosie's trunk. Her hand and Jacob's come very close to overlapping. When their eyes meet, one of them quickly averts their glance...There is clearly a growing attraction between them. But it's uncomfortable."
jacob,"I'm confessin that I love you. Marlena stops, her face flushed by Jacob's ""confession""."
marlena,What?
jacob,"The name of the song. ""I'm Confessin' That I Love You."""
marlena," --""Confessin' that I love you."" Beat. Jacob tries not to laugh. They return to stroking Rosie, trying not to look at each other."
jacob marlena,Louis Armstrong. Right.
kinko,"Queenie stop. Queenie stops. Kinko returns to his book. Jacob sees a NEW BED ROLL AND PILLOW, upon which sits a LETTER. He reads it:"
jacob,What is it?
kinko,"It's trouble, that's what. Not that I give a damn, but you're playing with dynamite with those two and you're gonna blow all of us up. August is the meanest sonofabitch I've ever met."
jacob,"I admit he has his moments of insanity but he's really a very generous, charming guy."
kinko,"You don't get it, do you? When August feeds your arm to a lion - that's the real August. The one who's generous and charming - that's the insane August. They hear a fight outside the car. They move to investigate:"
kinko,Six men got red lit last night. Cancelling shows and that damn elephant cost August. He needed to clean house to save on payroll... It's a lousy day when an animal gets paid and men don't.
jacob,Why are they beating him?
kinko,He hid one of the men who was supposed to be tossed. Word was the train was over a trestle instead of land. Nobody comes back from that.
august,"Get rid of him. He comes back on my property, you can shoot him. August walks away, with Earl and his men in tow. Blackie and his men drag the beaten Man away. As they turn, Jacob recognizes the Man; It is WADE who worked Jacob on his first day."
august,"JACOB! Come in, come in! Jacob enters their Stateroom which takes up half the car, with an additional room, cordoned off by a velvet curtain. The main room is paneled in walnut and outfitted with damask furniture, a dinette and a Pullman kitchen."
marlena,I'm so glad you could come. Would you like a beer? Or champagne?
jacob,I'm not dressed for champagne.
august,"We can fix that, can't we darling? August winks at Marlena who giggles at their secret as August ushers Jacob to the velvet curtain..."
marlena,People don't realize how much August does holding everything together. How difficult it is in these times. The whole company is like a family to him.
august,Thank you my love. He kisses her hand then turns to Jacob;
jacob,"Of course I do, August. You've been nothing but swell to me."
august,Good man!
jacob,I have to tell you something. You may not trust me after you hear it. August and Marlena pause - giving Jacob their attention.
august,"BAH! A worthless piece of paper from the ivy bush league! Of course you're a vet. You have the gift. You're idealism is just so...sweet. When are you going to learn that the rules written of, by and for these united states of suckers do not apply to us."
jacob,"Not about this, August."
august,"All right, let me ask you - do you honestly think this is the most spectacular show on earth?"
jacob, No.
august,"No. It's nowhere near. Lucinda, our Fat Lady, isn't 800 pounds. Four at the tops. And you really think the Tattooed Man got tattooed by headhunters in Borneo? He's from Pittsburgh. Took him nine years to ink himself. And you know what I did when the hippo died? Swapped out her water for formaldehyde and kept showing her. For two weeks, we travelled with a pickled hippo.."
jacob,To Rosie!
marlena,And Silver Star. August takes a beat and smiles warmly at Marlena...
august,"To all we love. He leans over and kisses Marlena longer than appropriate in front of a guest. Jacob downs his wine, closing his eyes. Suddenly, August grabs Jacob and Marlena and pulls them up to dance, throwing his arm around them both as we hear: Louis Armstrong's DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME. August starts singing along, imitating Satchmo's voice, encouraging Jacob to join in...August is a great performer, filling up the space with his impersonation. Jacob can only laugh along."
marlena,"Darling. Darling, please.."
jacob,"Is everything all right? Marlena puts a finger to lip and keeps it there, as she returns to her Victrola and selects another record. She cranks it on and plays it low. A RUTH ETTING SONG."
marlena,"Oh yes. He's just had too much to drink, that's all. I hope you had a good time tonight. I wanted so much to make things up to you."
jacob,Tonight was your idea?
marlena,"Oh Auggie wanted it too, he felt horrible about what happened. He really does like you Jacob. But it's hard for him. He's under a lot of pressure. He does more than people realize holding things together."
jacob,You said that.
marlena,"Well it's true...  One dance before you go? Jacob cautiously approaches. Marlena takes his hands but when Jacob presses closely against her and places his hand against her bare back, he almost swoons. They slow dance. Both tipsy."
jacob,What happened at 17?
marlena,"There was a parade for the circus. At the head, there were six black Fresians, 17 hands high wearing red tassles. So proud! So beautiful. And August was leading them. The second he looked at me, the way he looked at me, I knew I'd never live with strangers again. And the way he talked. Told me ""I'd find a home in every city..welcomed in every town...and he'd give me--"
jacob,He was pretty lucky to find you. Marlena is surprised by the compliment...and endeared.
marlena,"You're sweet to say so. Beat. Feeling exposed, Jacob searches to change the subject:"
jacob,Pretty song.
marlena,Don't tell him what happened... Jacob takes this as an intimate moment between them.
jacob,"Oh no Marlena, I won't ever tell. Marlena smiles, laughs, using Jacob's joke back on him;"
marlena,"That's the name of the song. ""Don't Tell Him What Happened To Me"". Ruth Etting. She's one of my favorites. Jacob's head starts spinning. Marlena takes care of him;"
jacob,I have no idea.
marlena,Maybe you should go to bed.
marlena,"Here, let me...We can't let you go out there all untied. A circus is a small town. What will people say? As Marlena ties his tie, Jacob's eyes simply rest on Marlena's face - sinking deeper in love. When Marlena finishes, she looks up to Jacob...She can tell Jacob is enamoured. She smiles warmly, touching his cheek..."
marlena," Good night. Marlena turns and disappears behind the velvet curtain. Jacob stands still for a moment, then exits."
kinko,"JACOB MY FRIEND!! Folks, this is my friend and roommate Jacob. I'd like you all to make him feel at home! Kinko starts laughing uncontrollably and before Jacob can protest or escape, Barbara and Nell approach him, moving in for the kill. Blurry-eyed, Jacob staggers back but the others refuse to let him leave. In fact, he is picked up bodily, raised above their heads and transported to Silver Star's empty stall as Barbara and Nell disrobe him."
kinko,"Where are you right now or where are you in an Aristotelean context because right now you're in a trunk. Inside the trunk, O.S. Jacob lifts his arm to Camera and discovers he is dressed in a red silk dressing gown..."
kinko,"Huh-huh. As Jacob struggles out of the trunk, we only see his arms."
kinko,You threw up on Barbara...And maybe Nell.
kinko,You look a little pale. Kinko holds the mirror to Jacob. We see for the first time:
kinko,Your balls itchy?
kinko,"It'll grow back. Aw come on, you still store about last night? Now I figure we're even. In fact, I probably owe you one. Feel free to borrow a book."
jacob,Let's just drop it. Kinko opens a book to read. Jacob notices Queenie's quiet.
kinko,"What do you mean ""wrong""?"
jacob,I mean she's not hating me. Something's wrong.
kinko," Yeah, she's been like this all day. I don't know...she must have eaten something. She did her business and it was kind of...watery."
jacob,Her stool? Did you look at it for parasites?
jacob,"Get some honey from the cookhouse. And if you can find any slippery elm powder. But the honey should do it. If not, we'll check her for parasites. Jacob starts to exit. As Kinko reads his book;"
kinko,Jacob?
jacob,Sure Kinko. He moves to exit again. Kinko never looks up from book;
kinko,Jacob?
jacob,Yeah.
kinko,My real name's Walter. They never look at each other but a friendship is formed. Jacob exits.
august,We got big trouble. Lucinda died. Now we've got no center ring star act and no sideshow star...
jacob,How did she die?
august,"I don't care where you find one, but find one.  Better get some kind of rig set up to lift her out of the car. How did you carry Silver Star out?"
diamond joe,In pieces.
august,Oh yes...  Mmmm...
jacob,August!
august,"No, no, of course, don't be silly! Right. Well, figure something else out Joe but get it down for the performance. Put her in the hippo tank for now."
jacob,Rosie...Up. Rosie just looks at him without moving.
jacob,Does everybody know what happened?
august,Yes.
jacob,Can somebody tell me? August suppresses a laugh.
august,I'm opening the midway and the menagerie this afternoon for some extra cash before the show tomorrow night. We'll see how she does with the crowd. She got any skills?
jacob,Finding food? But I don't really know how to do this.
august,"Well, first of all, you can't do anything with a bull without the bull hook. August takes the BULL HOOK from the ground."
jacob,"August, there's got to be another way."
august,We don't have the time! She has to start earning her keep MOVE! UP!
jacob,"Please, August, let me try again. But August angrily pulls it away and turns on Jacob:"
august,"Don't tell me my business! You don't want to watch this, get the hell out! Making love to it ain't going to work. Besides, from what I hear, you're not that good at it."
jacob,"I'm so sorry girl. Just a few more here. Hold still. The un-staked canvas flaps behind Rosie wave up with the breeze....Rosie's trunk rises. She smells something from outside the tent. When Jacob bends down for more ointment, Rosie tries to turn around but her chain is still staked into the ground. As Jacob straightens up, he sees: Rosie's trunk carefully wrap itself around the stake and pull it up out of the ground....She then manages to turn herself around, her butt to Jacob. Rosie's trunk then dives down and up under the canvas flaps."
jacob,"But as soon as the Spec started, we all knew it was too soon for Rosie's debut. Rosie heads the line. Marlena sits atop her, in her sequins and headdress, grabbing onto Rosie's leather halter."
marlena,Oh Jacob... August rushes out and is stopped cold by the sight of Marlena in Jacob's arms. He immediately tenses up.
jacob,"August, she's hurt. August takes her in his arms. Barbara appears to help."
august,"I'm here, darling, I've got you."
barbara,"Bring her to my tent, it's closer."
august,"Jacob, send Joe for ice. You go and find that Goddamn bull before we're run out town. And take the hook! August is seething, his expression cold, as he carries Marlena O.S. Jacob, concerned, takes the hook and runs O.S."
jacob,I'm sorry ma'am. I'll get her.
old woman,You better before she gets at my --
jacob,"Rosie, no! Stop! Rosie pauses for a moment, flapping her ears at Jacob, then shoves a bush of tomatoes in her mouth. Jacob almost laughs."
jacob,What's in the bucket?
greg,Gin and ginger ale. Elephants love booze. One whiff of this and she's not thinking about cabbages no more.  ... moj malutki paczuszek?
jacob,"Greg, right? Are you Polish?"
greg,Grabowski.
jacob,Jankowski. Greg again pushes Rosie's trunk away from the bucket.
greg,"Last show I worked, one bull faked a belly ache just to get the whiskey...Better grab the hook."
jacob,Are you a bull man? August would hire you in a minute.
greg,"Don't want the job. Not for him. Besides, I'm not bull man. I just like big beasts. Jacob gets it and follows Greg who carries the bucket."
jacob,How's Marlena?
august,A little shaky. Sore wrists. Bruised heel. Doc says she'll be fine. Did you catch the bull?
jacob,She's in the menagerie.
august,"Good. August takes the bull hook from Jacob and walks with cold blooded intent towards the menagerie. Jacob panics, realizing what August about to do. Jacob follows to stop him;"
jacob,"August! Wait! She was good! She came back on her own! Besides, you can't do anything now! The show is still going on."
august,"Get her out of here! NOW! Jacob wants to help Rosie but can not disobey August in this moment. He returns to Marlena and ushers her out, as August continues to beat Rosie."
jacob,"Rosie, what am I going to do with you? Rosie's eyes look up to him, her lashes blinking. Her trunk lifts and wipes at her own eye."
greg,"Here this will help. Poor beast. He really hurt her. Told you about him.  Don't understand why a man like that wants to be around animals in the first place. He shouldn't have the right, if you ask me. Listening to Greg, Jacob gets increasingly angry. He sees the bull hook. He grabs it and marches out of the menagerie."
earl's man,Somebody better find Earl.
jacob,No....What happened?
august,"She won't speak to me... He can't finish. He sits, burying his head in his hands."
jacob,I'm sure that's not true.
august,"Maybe you can talk to her. She's tired of my apologies but, this pressure I'm under...Of course, that's no excuse for what I did...  ...I can't believe what I did. Is she all right? The bull. Rosie."
jacob,She'll be OK.
august,Would you tell Marlena? And tell her...tell her I'll do anything. Anything she wants.
jacob,"August, I can't..."
august,"Thank you. My friend. Jacob nods, confused, his anger diffused. As he exits;"
earl,What's going on?
august,"Everything's fine, Earl. August nods to Jacob, who pushes past Earl to exit."
jacob,How's she doing?
greg,"Oh she's a strong one, this one."
jacob,Is she drunk?
jacob,Oh my God...
jacob,Just read those out loud. To Rosie. August reads the words in Polish with Jacob's help...
august,Rosie...da--da---
jacob,Daj.
august,"Daj...daj..no-ge. Rosie does nothing. August looks to Jacob. Jacob is worried. Greg suggests, in a low whisper;"
greg,Might help if he said please.
jacob,Say...Prosze Rosie daj noge.
august,Pros--Prozze Rosie...daj noge. Rosie lifts her foot. August's eyes gleam.
jacob,Go on.
august, Rosie...potoz noge. Rosie puts her foot down. August starts to understand.
august,We've got a new star! Greg remains cautious.
august,"Would you like to dance, darling?"
marlena,"No, thank you. Awkward beat. Marlena takes her champagne glass and drinks the last of it. August tries to make light of it."
august,We need more champagne.
jacob,I'll get it.
august,"No, you stay with Marlena. August kisses her cheek, but Marlena is clearly still upset. August lets her be. He exits O.S."
jacob,You ever going to let him off the hook?
marlena,Hook? That's an unfortunate choice of words.
jacob,Rosie's going be great. He won't hurt her again. I know it.
marlena,"Jacob, what you know about August is pretty much nothing."
jacob,Maybe you should wait for August.
marlena,"I want to dance now! She pulls him up onto the dance floor. Marlena dances light as air. She spins from Jacob then returns to his arms, so that her back is to him. Jacob's forearm is on her collarbone - skin to skin. Her chest rises and falls under his arm. Her hair under his chin, Jacob can smell her fragrance - then she unwinds away from, like a ribbon. When the music stops, everyone applauds their dance - including Marlena. Jacob beams. He looks up to the bar: August stands stock still. His eyes glaring at Jacob. The dark expression we've come to know. Seething with quiet rage. Jacob takes a step back from Marlena when suddenly they hear;"
marlena,"Lord, that was close...Aw, look at my stockings! And they're silk too."
jacob,"I wonder if August got out... Marlena looks up at Jacob and starts laughing hysterically, as if for no reason. They are both still drunk."
marlena,I want to see the Empire State Building.
jacob,What...what about August?
marlena,"I don't know where he is, do you? And he doesn't know where we are. It's not our fault. Like you said, who knows how long it'll take us to get back. Jacob is hesitant. Marlena takes his hand and softly pleads;"
marlena,I've never seen so far. Have you?  Look at it. As far as the eye can see and it's nowhere near all that's out there. Jacob notices tears in her eyes.
jacob,Are you all right?
aaahahahaahaaahaaaaa ahaahahahahaahahahahah,"The other couples leave the sky deck to get out of the rain and away from ""that crazy couple"". Marlena and Jacob stop, wet, panting, laughing from the release. Then, looking out at the view, not at each other..."
marlena,"I want you to go. I want you get away from us, from the show. You're smart Jacob. You deserve better than us. Leave as soon as you can or something terrible's going to happen."
jacob, Why are you saying this?
marlena,It's all right. No one can hear. We'll never get another chance to say it all. Marlena looks into Jacob's eyes and finally addresses what they're both thinking;
jacob,How can you be with a man you're frightened of?
marlena,"I'm not. I don't have to feel afraid of him if I don't feel anything...After all these years, I've learned how to do it so well. I tell myself, ""I'm managing. I can manage him. August loves me. Nobody else ever did. Who am I to say it's the wrong kind of love?"" .. See, there's no place for a woman like me in any decent kind of world. You know where they found me when I was a baby? ..."
jacob,I'm not that good. And I don't want to be.
marlena,Don't say that.
jacob,"No, I don't. Good men don't wind up with much in the end except their goodness. Isn't worth much, is it?"
jacob,You deserve as good a life any other girl.
marlena,"Am I still a girl? I feel so old. They kiss. They stop and silently acknowledge where this is going. As they move towards a secluded spot, they continue to kiss in between lines;"
jacob,I understand.
marlena,Promise me you'll suffer.
jacob,I already am.
marlena,Promise you'll look in my eyes the whole time.
jacob,"I promise. Jacob kisses her with his eyes locked onto hers...With Marlena's back pressed against the entrance, Jacob reaches up and locks the door. They sink to the ground."
jacob,"If I had money, if I could take care of you, would we be going back?"
marlena,You'd have to be a Rockefeller... August would find me. He always does.
jacob,Have you tried to get away before?
marlena,Jacob you promised. You said you understood it was only tonight.
jacob,I know. I do....I'm sorry.
marlena,Where were you when I was 17? Jacob smiles. They kiss not wanting to let go. Marlena pulls away and runs into the cab. Jacob watches it drive away.
walter,Why are you sleeping here? Somebody's looking for you.
camel,Hey kid. How nice to see ya.
jacob,"Hey, Camel. What's wrong?"
camel,"I don't know, kid. Woke up a few days ago and my feet was all floppy. Jes can't feel'em right..."
walter,"Like down there...man stuff? Camel, his eyes wide and fearful, nods slowly."
bill,"What's wrong with him, doc?"
jacob,I don't know.
walter,Jamaica ginger paralysis. Jake leg. I've seen it before.
camel,"No such thing. Is there Doc? Walter looks at Camel's empty ""Jake"" bottle."
walter,"The manufacturer started putting this plasticizer in it, or something, to get around regulations that Jamaica ginger extract not be sold as booze."
camel,Well what the hell am I supposed to drink to stop the shakes? It's Prohibition and I ain't no Astor.
grady,It's OK Camel. Tomorrow's payday. We'll get you some moonshine.
bill,"Grady don't lie to the man. If men were getting paid, Blackie wouldn't have tossed four of ""em between Boonton and Weehawken."
jacob,Four?...Will he get better?
bill,We can't leave him here. They'll red light him for sure. Jacob understands. He gets an idea and turns to Walter. Walter understands and reacts with an adamant:
jacob,"Walter, please. Blackie and his men only patrol the roustabout cars. They don't work the performer train. We can hide him easy until-"
walter,I was right about you. You're going blow us all up...August got home tonight before you and Marlena. People are talking. Walter stalks off leaving Jacob unhinged by the news.
jacob,Good morning.
marlena,"Good morning Jacob, how are you? Marlena smiles. Jacob senses others eavesdropping...but the table is far enough away, so they can't be heard."
jacob,"I wanted to, uh...Is there any chance I could speak with you alone?"
marlena,About what? Is something wrong?
jacob,"No, I...I just wanted to...Walter said people are talking about what happened...last night..."
jacob,"Well, I want to apologize for--"
marlena,"Ha,ha Jacob, it's silly of you to apologize for my torn stockings. You weren't even there. Jacob is crushed by her reaction. Marlena maintains her upbeat facade. August enters with his tray of food and crosses to them. He is smiling like a man who has spent the night having great sex. August kisses Marlena right in front of Jacob. It is a long sensual kiss...a holdover from their night together."
august,I slept like a baby after last night. Thank you my darling.
marlena,"August, please. We're in public. Jacob understands his meaning and is quietly devastated."
jacob,I don't know. I just ran.
marlena,"I told you, sweetheart. We got pushed apart by the crowd. This older married couple brought me to the ferry."
august,I'd like to look them up and invite them to the show free of charge...
august,"..It's a family. And like any family, when a new member is born, it's arrival must be greeted with celebration and gratitude. Now, we've been a little busy with sold out performances, thank the Gods.."
jacob,"Thank you, August."
august,It's from both of us. Jacob looks to Marlena. It is awkward between them. They can't kiss each other. Jacob nods and says courteously;
jacob,"Thank you, Marlena."
marlena,"You're welcome, Jacob. As Marlena exits with the others, we discover August watching from them a distance; August's expression tells us he knows what they are hiding."
marlena,I wonder if you could help me.
jacob,Sure.
jacob,No problem.
marlena,"Thank you so much...Oh, and I'm sure it would be nice for August if you were there too. Marlena turns and exits O.S. Jacob isn't sure what to think."
marlena,"Oh, he'll be here any second. Jacob, can you open this for me? Jacob takes the champagne bottle and manipulates the cork. Rosie's trunk is curious, inspecting the bottle in Jacob's hand. Jacob laughs. Marlena sees and laughs as well."
jacob,"Rosie...get away....ssstop!! Rosie continues fooling around, causing Marlena and Jacob to laugh even harder when the cork pops..."
august,Did you show Jacob the opening night present I gave you? Marlena turns to Jacob and indicates the diamond necklace.
marlena, Oh. No...Do you see Jacob?
jacob,Beautiful.
august,It looks stunning on you.
marlena,To August - an authentic miracle man because he made a star attraction out of me.
jacob,To August! August nods in gratitude. They tilt their glasses and drink.
august,Many thanks. Forgive me for arriving too soon and spoiling the surprise. August takes out a cigarette and lights it.
marlena,Don't be silly. I couldn't wait for you to come.
august,"I could go back out to give you more time...or better yet, yell RAID and clear the place out so you two can be alone. In a split second, Jacob and Marlena know the danger present. August gave no sign of it coming."
marlena,What?
august,"I'm sorry. I'm probably wrong. I assumed that night after the RAID was the first time you two fucked, but obviously it's been going on longer than that."
marlena,"Auggie, you're being silly."
august,Did you think I didn't know?
marlena,August don't do this!
august,Shut-up. SHUT UP!
marlena,"August, please, there's nothing-"
jacob,We should go!
august,WE!...So you two are a couple?
jacob,NO! I just don't think you're safe to be around a woman right now.
august,"A woman? This is not a woman. This is my wife you Ivy League lying piece of shit! Say, I bet the authorities would like to know you practise without a license."
marlena,"Auggie, please... Don't you see how much I love you?"
august,"I see you. I see you too clearly. Always have. I have to admit that was a nice touch when you got back from the speakeasy. Being with me in our bed, after being with him. Covering your tracks. I should have known a whore only performs for a man like that when she wants something."
jacob,"Marlena, come with me..."
earl,"No he won't, kid. Come on. Earl disperses the crowd that has gathered, which includes Walter, who sees Jacob's bloodied face and goes to him. FROM INSIDE THE TENT, THEY HEAR: Two soft thuds..then a louder one...Then an unnerving silence."
walter,"Come on Jacob. Walk away. With Walter's help, he tears his eyes from the billowing flap and walks away, passing rubes who watch with fascination."
walter,The only thing that's keeping you alive right now are the rubes who saw everything. August can't risk getting rid of you here. But you better not get back on this train when we leave tomorrow night.
walter,Shut-up Camel.
walter,August.
jacob,Why are we moving? We have a matinee tomorrow.
walter,"Something's gone wrong. SUDDENLY, A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. The three men immediately are on alert. Walter grabs his knife from beneath his pillow. Camel tries to shove himself behind the trunks. THE KNOCK COMES AGAIN as we hear:"
jacob,My God. Are you all right?
marlena,"Looks worse than it feels.  Ha, look at the two of us. Marlena awkwardly enters the room to Walter and Camel's stares. She sees the moonshine and breaks the ice."
walter,"Why is the train moving? Marlena sits with the jug, casually talking:"
marlena,"We're being run out. Apparently, August was so optimistic about money coming in for Rosie, he figured he'd double down and find himself a new fat lady to put him really toe to toe with Ringling...So he sent Mr. Erwin into town who finds this rather large woman in a restaurant and offers her the job. Except, she..."
walter,Aw girl. We're all in it now.
marlena,Why are you hiding that roustabout?
jacob,Because Blackie and his men don't work the performer train and they'll red-light him if they find him. He can't work anymore.
marlena,My God.
jacob,Does August know where you are?
marlena,No. He thinks I'm with Barbara and the girls. He won't go there.
jacob,He can't find you. As soon as we stop - before we stop - we'll jump off and I'll take you to a hotel in town.
marlena,And after that? August has all our money. Where will I go?
jacob,"Marlena, I'm not leaving you. We'll find a way together. I won't let you go back to him. I promise. Marlena smiles, needing to hear him say those words. She embraces him, grateful. Jacob holds her tight, assuring;"
marlena,"Oh Jacob, that would be wonderful. You know, I bet Ringling would take us both then - they'd be getting a vet and a star attraction - that's a sweet deal for them. Although I won't be a star but I don't care. I'll take no billing at all...We'd be safe from August if we were with Ringling."
jacob,Don't worry about him.
marlena,"Of course, I'd have to wait a while until I can work again..."
jacob,What do you mean?
marlena,Jacob...I'm going to have a baby. Jacob is stunned...then confused...
jacob,"Change my mind??? Oh Marlena, please...please be happy."
marlena," I will...I promise...as soon as I stop being terrified. Jacob kisses her. He guides her to the ground, against the hay. She nestles in his arms."
jacob,"Rest...I've got you now. Marlena tries, closing her eyes.....Then, without warning;"
barbara,Poor Kid...Help me with him..
jacob, Don't you work the matinee?
tattooed man,Not today. I'm fading. I gotta re- ink.
barbara,"Don't talk. Jacob nods. They cover him, pick him up and carry him off."
jacob,Marlena!!
walter,Sshh. Lie back.
jacob,Where is she? Did he hurt her?
walter,I don't know. Your pupils are two different sizes. Jacob pushes himself up onto his elbows but his world spins.
jacob,I have to get Marlena. What if he--
walter,"Jacob, look at me. You've got a concussion and you're on a moving train. There's nothing you can do. Marlena can handle him. She's done it for years..."
jacob,I have to get her.
walter,"Jacob, you can't."
jacob,She's going to have a baby. Walter is stopped. Camel shakes his head.
walter,Does August know?  What have you done to us?
jacob,"We're going to Ringling. Me, Marlena. You can too."
walter,"I'm a fifth rate clown when second rate circuses are folding all over the place. Doesn't put me on top of Ringling's list. They've got a dozen of me in the wings. I couldn't even go if I wanted to. August won't pay anyone. Says the show's debts have to come first. First time in Benzini Bros history performers haven't been paid. People are starving out there, Jacob. In the United States of America. Starving. Where am I going to go?"
camel,What about family? Like my son. Gotta have somebody...a mother.
walter,Not a woman I have any use for. She's sold me to this outfit when I
camel,She sold you?
walter,I'm not exactly cut out for farm work. Don't worry about me..
jacob,"Do whatever you have to, Walter."
walter,"You too, Jacob. They exchange a final look, which is a goodbye. Walter turns away from Jacob, holding Queenie to his chest. Camel looks compassionately at Jacob and says:"
camel,"Ya poor kid. The night this train passed ya...you shoulda kept on running, I guess."
jacob,Walter? Camel?
jacob,I'm not here to cause any trouble. I'm leaving.
august,"Funny, I thought you already left."
jacob,I'd like to say goodbye. To the menagerie. Just a few minutes and then I'll go. August's eyes narrow. Earl waits for the outcome.
august,"Earl, take him to the menagerie. Thirty seconds. Then escort him out of my circus, into Altoona. And if he comes back, you can shoot him, as that is within our lawful rights with regards to trespassers. August walks away. Earl escorts Jacob to the menagerie. On the way, they pass Barbara. Jacob pauses to hand Queenie to her. She has tears in her eyes. Jacob continues with Earl."
earl,"Come on kid. When Jacob starts to exit again, something happens:"
earl,It's good you're going. They must have known you got back on the train last night. He tossed more than half a dozen working men.
jacob,"Walter! Is he---? Instantly, Earl's expression tells Jacob it's bad news. Jacob's breathing almost stops as he listens;"
earl,"Keep walking...They got tossed off the trestle, if you can believe it. Camel's head hit the rocks. He died right away... Jacob is heartbroken and dreads what he's about to hear. Earl pauses for a beat...this part is harder to tell:"
jacob,Why are you telling me? Earl can not find the words: it's clear the killing of these men does not sit well with him.
earl,Oh Christ! Oh Shit... Earl runs back towards the Big Top.
jacob,What is it?
earl,The Disaster March! Everyone with the show barrels towards the Big Top when Greg appears amongst them and calls to Jacob:
sheriff,...These animals are now the property of Altoona and we're here to sell them to Mr. Nesci.
jacob,"Not all of them! Some of these animals are mine, like this bull."
dick nesci,Do you have any proof? Jacob is stalled. Greg appears.
greg,He's right. He's just an elephant tramp. The bull is his.
jacob,"You don't want her anyway. She can't do anything. Dumb as a box of peanut shells. Skeptical, Dick Nesci steps up to Rosie."
dick nesci,What's her name?
jacob,Gertrude. Jacob and Rosie exchange eye contact. Nesci is skeptical.
dick nesci,"Gertrude! Gertrude, step up! UP! Rosie blows and swings her trunk, throwing dirt across the people around her. Dick Nesci takes the bull hook and prods under her leg, ordering her UP! Rosie just swings her ears and sniffs Dick Nesci with her trunk. Then checks his pockets for treats. Jacob exchanges a look with Rosie."
marlena,What happens now?
jacob,"I wish I knew. Marlena exhausted, eases into Jacob's arms. It's over. WIDE ANGLE: Jacob and Marlena and their animals, as the giant tent of the Benzini Bros. Big Top falls to the ground."
jacob,"I convinced my dean to let me take my finals. Marlena was right. With my degree, our animals and Marlena's acts, Ringling got a sweet deal. Our son was born our first season. We named him Walter. He spent the first seven years of his life with Ringling."
charlie,It's the heat.
jacob,They're here for me. Charlie and Jacob exchange a look. Charlie understands.
charlie,"Hi Officer, can I help you?"
cop,"Yes, I'm hoping you can. An elderly gentleman went missing from the nursing home down the street. Staff seems to think he came here."
charlie,"We had a lot of folks from the home today. But no, I haven't seen him. The Cop peers past Charlie and sees Jacob."
cop,"Excuse me, but who is that?"
charlie, Oh....that's my Dad. The Cop is suspicious. Charlie covers:
cop,"OK, well, thanks for your time. Here's my number in case you hear of anything. Sorry to bother you. The Cop exits. Charlie returns to sit opposite Jacob. They consider this unspoken proposal:"
jacob,You sure about this? Beat as Charlie pours another shot. Then:
charlie,"I wonder if we can get you into the book of records. ""Oldest man who ever ran away with the circus""."
jacob,"Nah, I'm not running away. Just coming home."
jacob,"Thank you, Ma'am."
