twins,FADE IN:
werner, He was sent to an orphanage in Los Angeles. At the same time I brought you here to the island. Julius isn't listening.    His eyes shine.
julius, I have to find him!
julius," It was an honor to study under you, Master. Without warning, the Oriental tries to strike Julius in the face with the side of his hand, but Julius blocks the blow."
oriental," Ahhh, always on guard. You have learned well, Julius-san. Julius gives a last hug to Werner."
julius," I was just thinking, maybe my brother Vincent is married."
julius,"Well, if a woman loved my brother enough to marry him, she might have a sister who'd feel the same way about me. That often  happens with twins, you know. WERNER Julius -- please -- don't get your hopes up. Your brother doesn't even know you exist."
vince,"Me, too. I love this new mattress. It's soft but it's hard at the same time. And I love this new clock."
vince,"The curtains are the key to the whole thing. They're colorful... they're brilliant... they're... great curtains. CARLA  I think we're going to be very happy here. Suddenly we hear a DOOR downstairs as it OPENS, and a man's voice drifts up the stairs:"
vince, What's he doing back so early?
carla,"Be right down, sweetheart! Vince checks his appearance in a dresser mirror, straightens his Armani suit, brushes his hair, pulls it into a fashionable ponytail. He cuts a stylish figure. Noticing an expensive gold lighter on the dresser top, he covertly pockets it."
vince,"You're wonderful, Carla. Your husband doesn't deserve to kiss your feet."
vince, ... 'everything's going my way'... CUT TO:
al,"Carla and I figured, since you were always admiring mine, what the hell..."
vince,"A lighter, just like yours.   I don't know what to say, Al.   I'm all choked up."
vince,A very special stock -- and it was such a sure thing -- I borrowed another 20 grand from the Klane                      * Brothers. CARLA  You borrowed from a loan shark to invest in the stock market? VINCE On margin -- And as of last night I was ten thousand ahead. I'm                        * going to make a fortune -- turn on the T.V. CUT TO:
al,"You are having one shitty birthday, Vince."
carla,Don't you think you're doing this too often?
vince,I'm a desperate man.                                    *
al,Level three.   Stall 25. CUT TO:
owner,"We're in a recession -- Everything's tough -- you want to try someone else -- no hard feelings. VINCE  Forget it. OWNER You okay, Vince? You seem a little worried."
vince,"Me? I laugh myself to sleep every night, and I never sleep alone. I'm doing great! The Owner smiles and turns. Vince continues counting the money, nervous as hell. Now -- CUT TO:"
julius,"seated in the rear, still in his peasant garb, the bamboo suitcase resting on his lap. He has his headphones on and is singing along to the music, his eyes closed and his head bobbing. JULIUS  'I better wear some boxing gloves, In case some fool might want to fight.'"
julius," Sorry -- I've never heard this music before -- I love it.                             * She sighs, leans over him, fastens his seat belt, while Julius gazes down at her ample cleavage."
stewardess,The captain wants us to buckle our seat belts because we're expecting a little turbulence.
julius,"Actually, I'm a horticultural botanist, a mathematician, and a philosopher."
stewardess,Right.    And I'm a brain surgeon.
julius,"turns to the terrified elderly woman beside him who's clutching a hardcover Bible in her lap. JULIUS  Excuse me, ma'am."
hand,retrieving the hardcover Bible from the floor and --
bartender,It's him.    He's back.
linda,Like what? MARNIE Linda!
vince,I got involved in the stock market. LINDA  I promised Marnie I wouldn't give you money. Vince takes Linda's hand between his and stares into her eyes. LINDA Don't look at me like that... Don't do that with your eyes... I shouldn't even be here with you.
vince, That is so beautiful. How do you make up that stuff? You're such a poet.
linda," You gotta be more specific, considering our clientele."
burt klane,Benedict.
linda," He wouldn't show his face around here. Right, Marnie? * She looks down at -- * VINCE"
burt klane, Okay -- enough. CUT TO:
vince,The rest is invested.     We're gonna make a fortune.
linda,I hope this helps -- Please don't hurt him.
burt klane,There you go --  -- Another thousand -- Okay -- This nice lady just bought you a day Vince -- I want it all -- Twenty- thousand -- this time tomorrow.                        *
vince,"Twenty -- ?   But I just paid -- Just as he opens his mouth, Vince is elbowed again. BURT KLANE That's just the interest.    The                       * twenty's the principal.                                *"
julius, ... How wonderful...
julius,I... don't have a girl friend. Do women really wear these things? BIKER #1 If you're lucky. 
case handle,Julius's hand holds fast to it.    Then -- CUT TO:
julius,"just sort of standing there, no big deal, not much effort showing on his face as Biker #2 begins to slowly rise into the air as he and his cycle are about to be parted and then --"
riderless cycle,"ending its trip as it collides with a storefront and collapses on its side, MOTOR still ROARING but no movement anymore and -- CUT TO:"
julius,"I did nothing, the pavement was his enemy. CUT TO:"
julius,"I would say -- a concussion -- a mild shoulder separation, and ribs four to seven are cracked."
cop,Your vehicle's in a handicapped zone. Vince immediately hunches his shoulder and affects a limp. VINCE So?    Do I look normal to you?
cop,"You don't have a 'handicapped' sticker on your windshield.  Driver's license, please. CUT TO:"
cop,"You've got over 200 outstanding parking tickets, Mr. Benedict. And you just had your birthday? Well, your driver's license just expired -- Happy birthday.                               * "
mother superior,How did you know?
julius,"It's the one I would have chosen. It's next to the fire extinguisher. In case of a fire, I could have given the alarm, and saved the other orphans. MOTHER SUPERIOR We've only had one fire at St. Charlotte's. Vince Benedict started it, we like to think by accident."
julius,Tell me about him. Was he a good athlete? Did he like chess and poetry?
julius,"This is him?   He looks happy --                        * MOTHER SUPERIOR  He should -- that's Sister Maria,                       * his biology teacher."
julius,"I always liked biology. MOTHER SUPERIOR So did Vincent. He disgraced Sister Maria, who had to leave the order. Then he stole all the money from our library fund and ran away."
julius,But I have to find him.   Where do you think he might be?
mother superior,"Jail. A man of his character could only be in jail. You're full of goodness, Julius -- I pray that you never find him."
vince, World International Athletics                           * Representation. Vincent Benedict -- President. I coulda got you a no-cut contract so you wouldn't have to heist T.V. sets for a living --
guard,"leading an attractive, powerful inmate into the room. The guy is Julius's age. CUT TO:"
julius,"trying to fight his excitement, watching as the prisoner moves toward him -- -- then past him."
julius, Vincent... CUT TO:
vince,"listening, somewhat amazed.    Who is this loony?"
vince, Huh?    Again? JULIUS I don't know any Klane Brothers.
vince, Yeah.   Go on -- I got that part.
julius,My name is Julius -- I'm your twin brother.
vince, Obviously -- the minute I sat down I felt like I was looking in a mirror. JULIUS We're not identical twins.
vince,I wouldn't be too sure. 
vince," Listen, you get me outta here, I'll be whatever you want, best friend, brother, nephew, niece, grandma..."
julius,I have some more money -- VINCE You do?
julius,"I am happy to help you, Vincent. You're my brother. I love you."
vince,"Julius -- look -- ease up on the love talk or I'm gonna be tossing my cookies, all right? JULIUS Tossing cookies, that is more slang? VINCE Just gimme your wallet, okay? As Julius sweetly hands it over --"
vince,"No, you don't."
julius,You're thinking that this whole twin business is what you call 'bullshit.'
vince,"Actually, I was thinking I'm going to need some more money -- to put gas in my car --"
julius,You can take some more money -- VINCE I can? JULIUS Sure...
vince,We're brothers -- right? Julius tries to drape an arm around Vince's shoulder. Vince gives him a look. Julius drops his arm. TIME CUT TO:
vince,"They arrest you, they put you                             * behind bars, they fine you and                            * then they hide your car.                                  *"
julius,"That's --  -- your car, isn't it? CUT TO:"
vince's mustang,Which is what Julius is pointing at.
vince,Yeah --   How'd you know that was my car.
julius,We're twins! 
julius," I'm so excited -- we'll go to museums together, discuss philosophy together, read books together -- play chess together -- VINCE -- Get lost together -- And on that, he GUNS his CAR the hell away, leaving Julius standing there."
julius,"Deserted, alone in the sea of cars."
al,"You guys must be going to Hawaii, huh? Catch that good surf."
garfield,"Something like that. The two men just stare straight ahead, uninterested in conversation. Al hands the driver a ticket."
al,There's plenty of space on level four. The Cadillac accelerates up the ramp.
outside cadillac,"as the men get out, lock the car, wipe off the door handles, and then head for the elevator."

miss busby,"I tried to stop them, Mr. Benedict -- VINCE It was time to redecorate anyway. The PHONE RINGS -- Miss Busby drops to her knees beside it. MISS BUSBY  It's Al. As she hands him the phone."
vince,"I hope you got some good news,                         * Al --                                                  *"
morris klane,"Time's up, Vincent -- Got the money?"
vince,"In agony, on his knees. It hurts to breath.       He finally manages to look up at the giant --"
vince, Did you hit me yet? 'Cause I didn't feel nothin'.
morris klane,He grabs Vince again.
morris klane,"You gotta understand something, Benedict -- I like my work. He pulls  Vince groggily up and this time he's going for Vince's  face. He takes his time setting Vince up, getting  his chin at just the right angle. He's concen- trating  on his work, so he doesn't pay much attention to the fact  that the elevator door has opened behind."
julius, These are most unfriendly acts you are committing.
morris klane,Who are you? JULIUS Vincent's brother. VINCE  We're twins.
morris klane,You're firewood. 
julius,-- And I have no respect for those with no respect for logic. You're a very stupid person.
cut to:,"VINCE Watching as Julius picks up Klane with both hands and lifts him a foot up into the air, holding him there for a pause."
elevator door, slides open and... CUT TO:
julius,As he heaves Klane across the corridor into the open elevator Klane crashes down hard just as the door slides shut and... CUT TO:
julius,"How much money do you owe? Don't lie -- we're twins, I can feel your pain."
vince," Why do you keep saying that? We're not twins, we're not brothers, we're nothing, and you're only in this car because I could use a little protection these days --"
vince,"I don't know where my head is -- I forgot I promised this friend of mine -- Sammy -- I'd pick up his car at the airport -- do me a big favor, okay? Drive this car back from the airport for me. JULIUS I'd love to. Julius reaches into the glove compartment, takes out the car manual, begins speed reading it, running his index finger down the center of each page. VINCE What are you doing with that finger? JULIUS Learning to drive. Vince isn't sure what's going on at this point. Now Julius studies Vince's shifting moves, the way his hands work the steering wheel. Now he's back to the manual. Now he's staring at Vince. Vince and Julius's heads are both in motion now -- Julius's from the book to the wheel, Vince's from the road to Julius's finger. As their heads keep turning -- CUT TO:"
julius,What's the matter?
vince,That dopey Sam -- He did it again. Forgot to leave the keys... A lot of handicapped kids are gonna be really disappointed...
julius, Handicapped children?
julius,Maybe we should try to open it ourselves... Vince raises his eyebrows in mock surprise.
vince,You think we should do a thing like that?
julius,Of course -- it's for the children... CUT TO:
vince,"As he takes a breath, opens the door, scoots inside --"
julius,"The brakes worked just fine! VINCE Lemme tell you something about America, Julius -- nobody likes a smart-ass."
linda,There's only one Vince Benedict. He's a force of nature.
linda,"I know that -- Geez, you don't think I know that -- ?  Excuse me. She reaches past Julius to take a copy of Cosmopolitan. Julius drops the Playboy, which falls open on the ground, with the centerfold revealed. Flustered and blushing, he bends down to retrieve it, watched by Marnie, who can't take her eyes off the sheer beauty of his physique."
julius,"You all know each other? VINCE Julius, meet Linda and...  Her charming sister, Marnie."
julius, Twins? CUT TO:
vince," Goodbye girls, see you soon."
julius, Like maybe tomorrow.
julius,"Linda is your girl friend, isn't she?"
vince,"Yeah.   Kind of. JULIUS Is Marnie your girl friend, too? VINCE Marnie! Marnie hates my guts. She seemed to like you."
julius, She hardly knows me. A beat.
vince,That's the best way --   women love men who are mysterious   and devious. It keeps them on their   toes -- makes them excited you   know what I mean? JULIUS No.
vince,"You do like women, don't you?"
vince, He's a 230-pound virgin.                              *
parking spot,It's definitely empty. CUT TO:
webster,"He looks at the Cadillac key.    Clearly, he is not happy at the turn of events. CUT BACK TO:"
julius,He won the Nobel Prize.
julius,"I think it's important we try to find our fathers. VINCE You mean, all those geniuses who contributed to the... "
julius,"Dear Sister Anderson, your request for orphans benefits for Vincent Benedict has been denied. According to our files his mother did not die during birth. We have a current address for her at 172 Canyon Glen Drive, Los Angeles. Vincent's case seems to be one of simple abandonment and as such he is inelligible for aid. Vince snatches the paper back.    Julius stares at him, just stunned. VINCE That's right, Julius, she abandoned me. JULIUS This letter was written thirty                      * years ago. We were five years old                   * -- Our mother... didn't die when we were born...  I don't know about your momma, Miss Perfect of 1952, but my momma was a slut, and if she's still alive, I hope she's in a lot of pain. She dumped me once -- no way she gonna get a chance to do it again --"
julius,"Vincent, if they lied to us about Momma for all these years, maybe they lied to her, too. We must find her, we must check this address.                                            * "
vince,"Julius -- slow down -- I've got no time for this. You go hunt down                       * Mom, I've got a cash flow problem                     * to deal with."
garfield,The tests on the lower temperature gaskets look great.
larson,Looks like an easy weekend.
garfield,"on the sound of the name.      He looks at Larson.   A beat.        * LARSON  Christ, man, you were never                            * supposed to come here."
garfield, The deal was we were never supposed to meet. You're supposed to be...
webster,"Driving that Cadillac to Texas?  Got my driving gloves, got my driving glasses, got my hat... but no car."
garfield,This is bullshit! The car was there. LARSEN That's right. The parking attendant thought we were off for Hawaii.
webster, The parking attendant? GARFIELD He liked the car. We'd put on those damn loud shirts so we'd look like tourists -- LARSEN He asked us if we were going surfing. He was a jerk.
julius,"She was my mother. Granger looks at the photo, then at Julius. GRANGER You're Mary Anne's son? GIRL  Isn't that you, Grandpa?"
granger,They told your mother that you died at birth...
granger,I guess you could say I'm your father...
julius,One of my fathers -- GRANGER  The times I've wondered what would have happened if I'd married her... JULIUS Why didn't you?
granger,She turned me down. Said she was afraid to have children. She took it real hard when they told her you died. She even stopped painting. Did you know she painted? JULIUS Until yesterday I didn't even know she might still be alive... Who told her we died?
granger,"'We'? JULIUS I have a twin brother, Vincent. GRANGER There's two of you? She never                            * knew that, either."
granger,Mitchell Traven. He supervised the experiment for the government. 
julius,"I'll go see him. GRANGER Watch out for him -- he's kind of a dickhead, if you know what I mean. JULIUS No, I don't -- but I'm learning."
vince, Okay -- Six thousand -- that's as high as I'm going... CUT TO:
vince,"I guess twenty seems a little high to you. I'm a reasonable guy -- I'll take fifteen -- McKINLEY  Listen to me, you poor excuse for a warmed over turd, a deal's a deal -- VINCE -- But -- CUT TO:"
vince, Beetroot?
al,All three years.
carla," And you never told me until there was a stranger listening? Shit, what about my reputation? WEBSTER Where can I find Mister Benedict?"
al,I'm not saying. WEBSTER Let me get this right -- You're protecting the weasel who's been                        * screwing your wife for the past three years. AL He's my friend.
webster,"Well, I guess I'll have to beat it out of you --"
carla,Stop -- I'll tell -- He lives at 1622 Westridge Place -- He's got an office at the corner of Highland and Hollywood.
carla,"I always loved you, Al. "
webster, No one's gonna believe this one.
vince,You scared the living shit out of me -- JULIUS I met one of our fathers. He told me of a man in New Mexico who probably knows where Momma is. 
julius,"She didn't abandon you -- she didn't even know you were born! VINCE  Awww -- that's terrible. Vince removes Julius's hands, slides him away from the door, and opens it."
julius,"And she was told that I died! VINCE Look, Julius, I'm in kind   of a hurry. Sammy wants me to    take the car to Houston. Much    bigger bucks when you raffle for   charity in Houston. Julius takes the map from Vince, looks at it."
julius, -- New Mexico is on the way to Houston.
vince, A lot of places are on the way to Houston. I'll be back in a few days. Stay in my apartment. Run up my phone bill. Throw wild parties. Take advantage of me.
julius,"Vincent, we have to go see this man Traven in New Mexico! VINCE No we don't."
vince,You know -- you're right. This is fate -- destiny -- But there's no way I'm gonna drive for 1500 miles with you smelling like that --
julius, You're right -- I'll take a shower -- be right back --
linda,You were going somewhere -- you weren't even going to say goodbye --
vince,I got something in here --  A fortune! That's great!
neighbor,Never sleep with that man. Never loan him money. And never believe a word he tells you -- that's free advice. She slams the door shut.
linda,Vince...? VINCE 
linda,"I am because if you say 'no' one more time --  Okay, okay. Just don't let on to Julius. He thinks we're going to look up our ancestors, like in 'Roots' or something."
marnie,                                     * I heard you singing -- I baked some cookies for you.
marnie,Oh -- don't mind me. She turns her back to him.
linda,"throws open the door, with a big smile on her face. LINDA Guess what? Vince just invited us all to go to New Mexico and Texas. Vince comes in behind Linda, trying to conceal his exasperation."
julius,"That's a great idea, Vince."

webster, Your owner seems to be a very popular fellow these days.
webster,Howdy.
burt klane,"Who are you? WEBSTER It's not really important, is it? I wanted to feed the cat before I left. Webster starts for the door. Morris  blocks the doorway, cutting Webster off. BURT KLANE I asked you a question."
bob," We're the Klane brothers. That's Burt and Morris -- I'm Bob. WEBSTER Interesting genetic pool. You're looking for Vince Benedict, right? The brothers all nod."
webster,"Am I Vince Benedict? Morris stares hard at him, shakes his head."
webster,So what's the difference who I am? 
webster, It could be contagious.
marnie,I really hope so.
vince,"This ought to fit you. Julius removes the shirt he borrowed from Vince, who pretends to be horrified at the sight of Julius's huge muscles. VINCE Whoa -- get away from that window! There's women and children out there!  What is wrong with you?"
julius,What? VINCE You allergic to something? JULIUS No.   Why? VINCE What are those bumps doing all over your body? You're all swelled up. You look like you're about to explode. 
marnie,Good luck.                                               *
marnie,See you later.
julius," That's not necessary. I always sleep on the floor. Vince looks askance at Julius, then pulls the car away. HOLD ON Linda and Marnie, gazing curiously after them. CUT TO:"
julius,He's lying!
vince,Keep your voice down. This place is crawling with security --                              *

julius,I'm going to make him tell us the truth...
vince,No... CUT TO:
vince,... How did you know my name? 
laboratory door,"Chained and padlocked.      Traven unlocks it, pulls off the chains."
julius," approaches a delivery table, touches it gently, looks back at Traven. TRAVEN You came out first, of course...  We weren't expecting him."
vince,"gazes at the ""blender"" we saw Traven demonstrating in"
julius,He's wrong.
vince,You tellin' me I'm a side effect!?!
julius, Tell us where our mother is...                         * dickhead!
traven, I'll be back. Julius tosses him aside.
vince," So how come if we're the same, we're so damn different.                             * JULIUS We had six fathers, Vince. We're different parts of a lot of different people. Vince is starting to get interested again. VINCE Yeah? JULIUS And remember, I was taken to a beautiful island, protected, educated, loved, given every opportunity to grow, to dream, to create. But you had none of that."
julius,"You had nobody. Nobody to love you, nobody to trust you, nobody to encourage you. All life taught you was that the only person you could count on was yourself. Tears begin to well up in Vince's eyes."
vince,A family?   You really think so?
vince,With like Thanksgiving dinner? And Christmas trees...
julius,... and a real home where you'll always be welcome. VINCE Always? JULIUS Even when you've been bad.
julius,"Do I look okay? VINCE You look better, put it that way. We got to do something about the way you walk. You're moving a tad stiff, Jules. Ever see                         * Frankenstein? JULIUS I read the book. VINCE That's not gonna help. You got to walk like you're moving in time to music. I'm not talking about military marches now, I mean Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Archie Bell and the Drells and a couple of white                   * guys.                                              *"
vince,"Like this... You just got to try to be cool, you know? Try these on."
julius, We know where to find our momma! VINCE Everything Julius said was true. I'm the product of geniuses! LINDA I always knew that.
vince,"Of course, but it's nice to make it official. * JULIUS                                      * Tommorrow we're going to finally meet our mother. VINCE                                       * And tonight we celebrate!"
vince,"Talk to her, buy her some drinks, dance with her. Girls like to dance."
vince,I guess you haven't done that before either.
vince,"Well -- forget all that disco shit, everyone's seen it. When I really want to romance a girl, I waltz with her."
julius,You dance with them?                                     *
vince,It turns them to putty in your hands.
vince,"He shoves a chair out of the way, making a little room. VINCE Okay, come here, put your feet by my feet -- JULIUS  Well, you've learned to waltz. Now it's time to introduce you to the wonderful world of getting shit-faced. CUT TO:"
marnie,Er... no...
julius,"Actually it was invented by the Assyrians, but the Eygptians were the first people to perfect the malt fermentation process. LINDA You sure know a lot about beer."
marnie,"He knows a lot about everything. Julius polishes off the bottle, belches."
vince,"Well, we're going to change all that -- aren't we, Marnie? Julius, embarrassed, looks over at Marnie, who's smiling sweetly at him. JULIUS Can I ask you a question?"
marnie,"Anything... JULIUS Am I shit-faced yet? Linda, surprised, does a spit-take with her beer."
marnie, You're getting there. Vince gets to his feet. VINCE Please excuse me -- my back teeth are floating.
julius,"I better see if mine are, too. Julius takes off after Vince."
julius,"You do that too, huh? "
julius,I don't think she really likes me.
vince,Piece of cake. You're nervous 'cause it's your first time. Perfectly natural.
julius,"Were you nervous? VINCE I was twelve and she was a nun -- that's real pressure. They both finish at the urinals and begin washing at the sink. VINCE I got to admit it, Jules -- since I met you, life is getting better all the time. Julius, a little smashed, can't hide his feelings.    He grips Vince by the shoulders."
julius,"For me, too, Vince! Sometimes I'm so happy, I want to pick you up and hug you! Julius starts to do so, just as another man enters."
vince,"Hey, cut it out! Not in here! Julius releases Vince, who clocks the other man's reaction."
vince," Go easy on the beer, okay?"
beetroot," God, I love a professional..."
linda," Let's go to the ladies' room. MARNIE But we just went. Linda takes Marnie by the hand, just as --"
burt klane,This has gone way past a simple case of loan deliquency. BOB KLANE We don't like getting shot.                                *
vince,What are you talking about?    We didn't shoot anybody. 
julius,What do you want?
burt klane,We want to take Vince out to the parking lot and kill him. A long beat.
vince,"That's kind of drastic, don't you think?"
julius,You moved too soon... BURT KLANE What? JULIUS The second rule in a crisis situation:
morris klane, He's starting that funny talk again...
burt klane,Meet my cousins.  Get these jerks outside.
julius,"Quite a few. They were formulated by a Kendo swordsman in the 17th century, but their philosophical underpinnings can be applied to many other areas of life. VINCE I bet."
marnie,"Hi -- Vince and Linda want to be                        * alone, so I'm afraid I'm going to stay here. Which bed should I take? JULIUS  Either... I always sleep on the floor."
julius,Good night.
marnie,This mattress is just as bad as the other one.
julius,Good night.
julius,Are you cold?
marnie,"It's alright. JULIUS No, please, take my shirt.      I'm               * baking. Julius strips it off and hands it to her. She puts it on and pulls the blanket over her shoulder. Again she shivers. JULIUS You still cold?"
marnie,Just my legs.
marnie, Thanks.
julius,Anything else? MARNIE I'd love a glass of water.
julius, Right.
marnie,Do you mind if I share your blanket? -- Mine's all wet.
julius," No -- that would be okay. They both lie down under his blanket.      Silence... MARNIE Could we switch sides?   I like to sleep on the left. JULIUS Sure. She starts to roll over Julius, then pauses directly above him and looks him dead in the eye. MARNIE Can I ask you something for a change? JULIUS Anything."
marnie,"Do you like me? I mean, even a little bit?"
julius,"I... I'm crazy about you, Marnie. But there's something about me you ought to know."
vince,"Hey -- I sleep great every night --  I couldn't do this without you, Linda."
linda,"I know. That's why, when we get back, I think we should move in together. VINCE  I just want to live with    you."
vince,"I'm no good at playing house -- I'm grouchy in the morning, cranky in the afternoon, moody at night -- "
vince,"Why don't we sleep on this, okay? I mean, I've got a big day tomorrow.  It's gonna be great -- taking my best girl to meet my mom."
linda,"Am I really your best girl? VINCE There's nobody else, Linda, not anymore. LINDA There better not be, because...  'I only have eyes for you...' They kiss."
julius,I think I would have remembered...
vince,"Good idea. One bunch from me, one from Jules."
marnie,And one from us -- Julius smiles happily at Vince's thoughtfulness.
julius, You mustn't always think of money.
vince, You got me wrong -- I'm just saying it's nice Mom's loaded -- that's a worry she won't have to have in her old age. Julius smiles at Vince and rings the bell. A MALE CUSTODIAN answers the door -- friendly but very firm.
custodian,Can I help you? 
linda,Introduce yourselves.                                   * As they take a step in the direction of the painter. WOMAN  Hey!
vince,Please don't do that -- look -- this isn't one of your average everyday situations -- she's our mother is the thing.
julius,We're her sons.
vince,Twin sons. GARDENER -- You're comedians -- VINCE We're kind of a surprise.
gardener, I'll bet you are -- follow me.
julius, -- It is her --
vince,-- Is Mary Ann?
gardener,No -- This is an artist's colony; there's a lot of painters. 
gardener,"You can't really own something like that view over there, or that sunset, can you?"
vince," No, of course not."
julius," I can't wait to meet her. GARDENER This way, please. The Gardener ushers them towards a door in the garden wall. She opens it, politely stands back, letting them go through it. They turn back to look at her. GARDENER Mary Anne Benedict never understood why people wanted to buy her paintings. But for a brief period they were considered valuable. She used the money to buy Whispering Pines so that young artists would have a place to work."
gardener,She never wanted to be famous. She just wanted to be left alone.
julius,"May I ask you a question?  Why do you keep referring to her in the past tense? GARDENER Because she passed away, some time ago."
vince, Can we get the hell out of here?
painter,"What was that all about? GARDENER These real estate developers won't be happy until they turn this place into a golf course. PAINTER Now they're climbing over the walls? GARDENER They're shameless. They'll try anything.  Those men claimed to be my twin sons, if you can believe that. It was really quite disturbing. PAINTER Oh, Mary Anne, I am sorry..."
vince,"Do I look like a young artist to you, Linda? MARNIE  I know what she meant. And I know why she's here, too. It's got nothing to do with my mother and everything to do with money. LINDA You know that's not true."
vince," Bull-shit. Julius, who's been quiet and distant throughout, suddenly intercedes. JULIUS Take it easy, Vincent.   It's not her fault. VINCE You hear that, everybody? The                          * creature from the black lagoon                         * just put in his two bits. I                            * should have my head examined for listening to you in the first place -- deal-of-a-lifetime opportunity and I'm driving around looking for a dead mother."
julius, All I wanted was to make us into a family.
marnie, He dumped us in the middle of New Mexico.
julius,We'll be fine. And maybe he'll be better off alone.
linda,"You don't know -- he's got something worth maybe millions in that trunk -- he could get himself killed delivering it. JULIUS He's been getting out of trouble all his life, he's good at it. MARNIE He may need you."
julius," Julius -- you're still very smart it's just you're not thinking so well right now -- on account of what you found out at Whispering Pines -- but you're not alone, you know -- I mean, you live long enough, everyone's mother dies..."
vince,"Okay, Beetroot -- It's time. I'll be there tomorrow -- where do we meet and trade?"
julius," Don't worry, Linda. I found him once, I'll find him again. MARNIE Be careful...                                              *"
julius,He turns away. CUT TO: MARNIE watching.
vince,I thought we had a deal here.
bodyguard, This is it. VINCE This is what?
beetroot, What are you waiting for?
vince,Five million dollars --
bodyguard, You wanna count it? VINCE I trust you.
webster,"emerges from the shadows with a powerful pump action                * shotgun. He opens the Caddy and pushes the dead                     * Bodyguard off the horn. Beetroot has a hole in his head, as well.  Webster turns and gazes back toward Vince who is sprinting for safety. Webster calmly goes after him, reloading his rifle."
webster,FIRING at the sound. He can't see Vince but he pours his fire at the window Vince broke -- large chunks of the              * BUILDING EXPLODE off wherever Webster fires.                           *
webster,"Pack it in, Vince, you're only wasting time -- I don't give a damn about you, just the money -- He's reloaded during this -- moving forward as we..."
webster,moving in on the shattered window.     A bit irritated.
webster,"Vince, if you don't cut this horseshit I may have to hurt you."
julius, Leave my brother alone!
julius,I've got the money. WEBSTER  -- come on down. CUT TO:
vince,"No way... this is bullshit...  Julius, you putz."
julius,I needed something to read on the airplane.
webster," Yeah, well your flying days are over..."
vince,"hands held high, appears, stands beside Julius."
vince,I am never going to forgive you for this.
julius,You were going to get killed. I tried to distract him so you could escape.
vince,"Because, thanks to you, I'm now not only a godamn psychic, I've got this disease called a conscience! JULIUS Nobody ever said being good was easy."
julius, Who wants it first. JULIUS Shoot him.   This whole thing is his fault.
webster,Whatever you want.
julius,"pulls a gun from his sleeve and blows Webster's weapon out of his hands. Webster screams in pain, clutching his hand, dancing around. VINCE  Ooooh -- you lied? JULIUS I had to. Vince beams with deep fraternal pride.       Then he turns to Webster and snatches the case back."
vince,"Looks like you messed with the wrong people, wise guy."
webster," But your luck just ran out. A stream of gas is pouring out of the drums that Webster punctured whilst he was shooting at Vince. It runs in a broad stream across the warehouse floor, right beneath Julius and Vince's feet. Webster is holding his cigarette out, ready to drop it in the fuel and incin- erate them."
webster,"Drop the gun and give me back the case, or we're gonna have ourselves some barbecued Benedict. Julius drops the gun and Vince slowly hands back the case. Webster smiles and backs off down the stream of gas, still holding out the cigarette. He stops at the very edge of the building. WEBSTER Well, I guess this is goodbye. He raises the cigarette, ready to throw it. JULIUS Wait a minute. Webster looks up."
julius,You've forgotten something. Webster grips the case tighter.
webster,I don't think so.
julius,The third rule in a crisis situation.
julius,drapes his arm around Vince as they walk towards the unharmed attache case full of money. JULIUS You came back for me.
vince,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. JULIUS I always knew you would. VINCE You're my brother, right?  We're a rich family, right?"
julius,-- Including us -- think how much                       * better you'll feel when it's out of our lives --
vince," -- I won't -- I won't feel one bit better -- I'll never feel better, not if I live to be... oh no --                         * As the sound of POLICE SIRENS get LOUDER we -- FADE TO BLACK."
painter,I think you'd better read this...
vince,"Linda, I -- LINDA What the hell are you doing here? VINCE You wouldn't answer     my calls or my letters, so I...     Look, I made a terrible mistake     and I apologize and I want to tell     you that I'm a changed man. Linda is almost buying it, but then -- LINDA How did you get in here? VINCE Well, there was a window in the back that --"
linda," Typical. She walks past him, approaches her door, puts in the key. Vince follows, speaking softly, his sincerity absolutely genuine."
vince,"All I ask is for another chance. I know I probably don't deserve it, but --"
linda,"You're right, you don't deserve it."
vince,"I had to break into your apartment, but --"
linda,"Vince, they're beautiful. VINCE So, do you forgive me? Linda hesitates."
linda,"Yes, but... VINCE But? Vince looks at her, understands. VINCE You mean, that matter we talked about once and never really resolved."
linda, What matter is that?
vince,The matter of you and me living together.
linda, What about it?
vince,Your place or mine?
vince,"Just as long as they pay -- we're not running a charity, you know."
vince,Come in!
julius,"Watching them. Now there are tears on his face, too. He goes to them, gently puts his arms around them, lifts them both up in to the air, cradling them. They're laughing.   They're crying.   They're holding each other."
julius,"They kepp you up all night again, too? "
julius, What a surprise -- so do you.
vince,Now that's a scary thought. They both yawn simultaneously once again.
