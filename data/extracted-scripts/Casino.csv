Speaker,Dialogue
sherbert," ...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room..."
nicky,"Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra c-note a week just to watch the door.  I mean, it's routine. Business as usual: in, out, hello, goodbye. And that's all there is to it. Just another fat fuck walkin' out of the casino with a suitcase. Now, that suitcase was goin' straight to one place: right to Kansas City ...which was as close to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go without gettin' themselves arrested."
piscano,"Hey, John, how are you? How was your ride?"
nance,Somethin' smells good.
piscano,"Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat."
borelli,Did you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano?
forlano,Jerry Steriano?
borelli,Yeah.
piscano's mother,That man's here again.
piscano's mother," Here you are, gentlemen."
gaggi,You got a round figure on it?
nance, About twenty pounds.
gaggi,So?
nance,That's around seven hundred thousand.
gaggi,"Uh-huh, good."
andy stone, I know it's a little early for Las Vegas...
stone,This is a very auspicious occasion.
stone,"Philip, if you would rise."
stone,"On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . ."
stone," ...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers."
green,Thank you.
green,"...I say that, knowing full well just how much competition we have in this great city."
ace,"You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me."
stone,You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
ace,But what happens when they do find out?
stone,"Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license."
ace," It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way."
stone,You got it.
ace,I'm serious. No interference.
stone,Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. I guarantee it.
ace, Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
dealer,"Yes, sir."
ace,I'll take Columbia for twenty.
lucky larry,Twenty dimes on Columbia . . .
gaggi, Ma che cazzo!
gaggi,That's enough now!
gaggi,Va fa 'n culo! [Italian-American slang for 'Fuck off']  Johnny!
nicky," Hey, did you bring that thing?"

gaggi,Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
ace,"Well, that's why they paid so well."
gaggi,"You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?"
ace,"Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?"
gaggi,Okay. You come by the house?
ace,I'll come by.
gaggi,Seven o'clock?
ace,Seven o'clock.
gaggi,"Good job, my boy. Keep it up. Okay, Ace?"
gaggi," Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']"
nicky, I'll be right out.
gaggi,T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
nicky,Mm.
gaggi,"Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him."
nicky,Mm.
gaggi,"Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?"
nicky,All right.
gaggi,Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
nicky,Yeah.
gaggi,Fine.

nicky,'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
ace, Excuse me.
joe,What?
ace, Is this yours? Your pen?
joe,"Yeah, that's my pen. Why?"
ace,"I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost."
joe,"Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?"

joe, This fuckin' asshole.
nicky,"What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!"

sherbert,Certainly.  Senator.
sherbert,We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
ace,Nice to see you again.
sherbert,"Ken, I don't know what the hell went wrong. I'm awfully sorry."
ichikawa,This is a big problem. Big problem.
sherbert,"I can't understand it. These mechanical things, you know, they happen. Hey, be-better here than  up there, you know what I mean?"
agent,"I'm so sorry. There's a convention in town, and all flights are booked."
sherbert,A convention?  I can't believe that there's a convention. It's never... ?
ichikawa,What can I do?
ace,I'm sorry you missed the plane.
ichikawa,"You want to get my money back, right? "
ace,"No, no, no. No gambling. No."
dealer,The bank wins a natural eight over a five.
dealer,"Six, an easy way. Six! All right, who's gonna give me..."

Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here."
nicky,I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
ace,"Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit."
nicky,Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.
nicky,You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
marino,Of course.
nicky,Tony.
tony,Hey.
nicky,How you doin'?
tony,How you doin'?
nicky,"All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?"
tony,"What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'."
nicky,"I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it."
tony,You sure?
nicky,I'm positive.
tony,"Well, I'm a little confused here."
nicky,You're a little confused?
tony,Yeah.
nicky," Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like, you know, you'll - you'll get unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money!"
tony," I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it."
nicky,"Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!"
tony, My fuckin' head.
nicky,"Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony."

ace," All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?"
winner,I just wanna get out of here.
ace,And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
winner,I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
ace,"You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?"

winner,Thank you.
ace, Throw him out in the alley.  And just tell the cops he got hit by a car.
ace,"We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?"
ginger,"What, are you trying to handicap me?"
ace,"I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family."
ginger," You got the wrong girl, Sam."
ace,I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
ginger,"You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?"
ace,I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
ginger,"You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't."
ace,"Yeah, I know all that."
ginger,"I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you."
ace, I - I - I...
ginger,Understand?  I'm sorry.
ace,"No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that."
ginger,"If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?"
ace,"You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine."
ginger," What're you... what're you pitching me, here?"
ace,Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
lester, Can you feel my eyes on you? Can you feel me look into your heart?  Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach? Can you feel me in you? In your heart?
lester,Don't make me come there. Answer me.
ginger, I love you.
lester," Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?"
ginger," No, Lester."
lester, Do you know that?
ginger, Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.

lester, God... I wish you...
lester, ...all the luck in the world.
ginger, You do?
lester," Yeah, I do. I mean, it's - it's the - it's the best thing you can do right now. I mean this. And you'll have real security.  Sweetheart... you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas."
lester," Come on, this is great for us. You know I'm gonna be here for you. I ain't going no place. Huh?  I'm lookin' at you right now. I'm seein' you for the very first time, right this minute. I'm seein' you, and I can feel my heart click. I see you fourteen years old. I see you the first second I ever saw you. I see you, long-legged little colt -"
lester,- with stupid braces on your teeth.
ginger," Okay, then."
lester," Every time I ever see you, that's what I see."
ace,You all right?
ginger, Yeah.
ace,Why're you crying?
ace,Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
ginger,I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
ace,It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?

ginger,Oh...
ginger,No one's ever been so nice to me.
ginger," Oh, my God."
ginger,"So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?"
ace,"You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?"
ginger,"You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either."
ace,The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
ginger, Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
ace,"Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important."
ginger,Okay.
ace,"All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life."
ginger,"Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?"
banker,Now this is just a signature card.
ace,"So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?"
banker,That's right.
banker,"That's the way you wanted it, right?"
banker," Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife."
ace," Yeah, sure I do. Why?"
banker,"No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't."
ace,Well...
marino, Don't make us come lookin' for you.

nicky,What do you got?
doctor dan, Jesus Christ. I can't believe it.
doctor dan,"If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck. I'm out of here, you understand?"
ace, Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
nicky,"So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?"
ace,You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
ace," I don't give a shit who he's connected to. Tell him to take his fuckin' feet off the table. What's he think this is, a goddamn sawdust joint?"
sherbert,"Sir, would you mind taking your feet off the table and putting your shoes on, please?"

nicky, No.
ace, He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
ace, ...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
nicky, What?
ace, Then he called me a faggot.
ace, So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
nicky," Hey, come here."
nicky,You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
cowboy,"Nicky, I did -"
nicky,Is that what you did?
cowboy,I did - I didn't -
nicky,Tell him to go fuck himself? You fuckin' hick!  Fuckin'...
nicky," ...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here."
marino, Get up.
nicky," Come here, come here."
marino,Get up.
nicky,You go over there right now and you apologize. You better hope he lets you back in.
nicky," If you ever get out of line over there again, I'll smash your fuckin' head so hard..."
nicky," Sammy, listen..."
nicky," ...this guy obviously doesn't know who he was talkin' to, you understand? He doesn't..."
nicky," ...know that, uh, we're dear friends. I mean, he's already very sorry. But, uh, if you could do me a favor to let him back in, I swear to you he'll never get out of line again. I promise you that."
ace," If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again."
nicky, I'm sorry about this. Really.
nicky," All right, Ace?"
ace, Okay.
nicky," Thanks, pal."
nicky,"You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go! Get the fuck out of -"
cowboy,"Nicky, I'm sorry."
ace, What's the reason for this?
stage manager,"Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension."
ace,Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
stage manager,"Well, sir, I was just..."
ace,Why is she eight pounds over?
stage manager,...trying to offer you the respect that your...
ace,I...
stage manager,...position...
ace,'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
stage manager,"Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows..."
ace,She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
stage manager,...and she doesn't always -
ace,...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
stage manager,"But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired."
ace,"That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris."
stage manager,It's always been our policy -
ace,No. Just stop everything.
sherbert, This woman's an institution.
ace,"I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy."
ace,You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
nicky,"Why, somebody's complaining?"
ace,I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
nicky,That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
ace,"Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you."
nicky,"What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all."
ace,I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
nicky,All right.
green,"Sam has established himself as an indispensable member of the gaming community. As the head of the Tangiers Gaming Corporation, it's my pleasure to welcome Sam Rothstein to the Vegas Valley Country Club."

ginger," Oh, fabulous."
ginger,Look at this. Look at this.
ward,Loose machines are right back over there.
ace,What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
ward,"Okay, I'll -"
ace,What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
ward,Well...
ace,These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
ward,"Yeah, okay."
ace,"The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front."
ward,"All right, I will, I will."
ace,"Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?"
ward,I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
ace,"Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this."
ward,"Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I am so sorry."
jennifer," So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?"
ginger, I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
jennifer," Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it."
nicky, What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
nicky, Do you believe this shit?
ace," Yeah, I believe it. You got banned."
nicky, 'Who is of notorious and unsavory reputation...'
nicky,Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
ace,"Nope, there's no way."
nicky,Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
ace,Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
nicky,"In other words, I'm fucked."
ace,"In so many words, yes."
nicky,I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
nicky, What's takin' so long over there?
marino,This peter's a motherfucker.
hardy, It's workin'. Just keep workin' it. It's comin'.
nicky,Gotta learn how to open these fuckin' things so you won't have to take 'em.
nicky,"Frankie, some of these stones got a lot of niggers in 'em."
nicky,"Tell that fuckin' Pepe if he's switching stones on us, he'd better take a fuckin' camel -"
nicky,- back to  Yeah.
hotel receptionist, Listen...

hardy, Car's comin'.
store owner, I just got a shipment of diamonds from Israel...
marino,"No, no, there's no flaws in it."
marino,You better clean your fuckin' loupe. 'Cause there's no flaws in these diamonds.
marino,"What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?"
marino,"Forty thousand dollars, you can buy the whole package."
marino," Let's talk turkey here, how 'bout twenty-five thousand?"
marino, She asleep?
nicky,"Every night, on the couch."
nicky,Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
marino,I took care of everybody.
nicky,Yeah?
charlie clark,"Yeah, that works out."
charlie clark,"You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss."
nicky,"Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere."
nicky,"I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?"
charlie clark,Yes.
nicky,"Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash."

nicky,Pleasure.
stacy,"Hi, Nick."
marino,We're gonna have dinner. Come on.
nicky,"All right, uh,  Let's just check the kitchen first. Excuse us one second. Come on, I'll show you."
nicky,I get bread from back home. I get fish from California. And you can always tell a great kitchen like ours because of the milk-fed veal. That's the secret.
nicky,"See, milk-fed veal is pure white. Out here, they got that pink veal. Slide over, honey."
nicky,"Now, pink veal, you can pound that shit for two days and it'll never get tender, you know what I mean?"
al,When I left here with the money...
nicky,Mm.
al,...I got muscled on the street.
nicky,Mm.
al,"A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did."
nicky,Yeah?
al,Yeah.
nicky,"You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?"
nicky,Huh? And you didn't gamble that fuckin' money? You're gonna stand here and tell me that?
nicky,"No, no? You didn't?"
al,I didn't give 'em the m-
nicky,"Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a fuck out of me! You want to embarrass me and make a fool out of me?!  You didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled the fuckin' money, I'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?!"
nicky,"Fuckin' degenerate, you."
nicky,Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.
al,"Thanks, Nick."
nicky,"Yeah, thanks."
nicky,"Let me find out you fucked up, I'll leave you wherever I find you."
nicky," How many of these you gonna eat, huh?"
little nicky,Two.
nicky,Two?
nicky," Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?"
little nicky,Mm-hm.
nicky,"You know why, right?"
little nicky,Yeah.
nicky,Why?
little nicky,'Cause it clogs up your heart.
nicky,"What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat."
marino,Remo.
gaggi,"Hey, Frankie."
marino,How are you?
gaggi,"Fine, fine."
marino,Nicky sends his warmest regards.
gaggi,Uh-huh. Good.
gaggi,And how are things going down there?
marino,Fine. Everything's goin' good.
gaggi,...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
marino,"I'll take care of it, Remo."
gaggi,"E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!']"
nicky,"This fuckin' guy, he got some stamina, don't he?"
nicky,"Personally, I don't give a fuck who was with him anyway. As long as he gives me a name I could give to them."
nicky,"You better hope he gives me a fuckin' name soon, or I'm gonna give him yours, Frank."
marino," Yeah, thanks a lot."
nicky, I know you would have ratted by now.
nicky,"Dogs. Dogs, can your hear me, Dogs?"
nicky,"Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on."
tony dogs, Fuck you!
nicky, Fuck me?
nicky,"Fuck me, you motherfucker?  Fuck my mother? That's what you fuckin' tell me?"
nicky,"Huh? You motherfucker, you, huh?"
nicky,"Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!"
tony dogs,Ch-Charlie M!
nicky,Charlie M?
tony dogs, Charlie M.
nicky, Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
tony dogs," Kill me, you fuck, kill me."
nicky,"Kill you,  Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor."
nicky,Charlie M!
ace,"Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?"
ward,"Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more."
ace,Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
ward,"Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you."
ace,You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
ward,"Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam."
ace,"Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!"
ward,"Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes."
ace,"Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. Now, you're insulting my intelligence. What do you think, I'm a fuckin' idiot? You know goddamn well somebody had to get into those machines and set those fuckin' reels."
ace,"The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?"
ward,I really think you're -
ace, You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
ward,I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
ace," Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here."
ward,You're firin' me?
ace,"I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin'  I'm firin' you, you -"
ward,"You might regret this, Mr Rothstein."
ace,I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
ward,This is not the way to treat people.
ace,"Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on.  Let's go."
ace,"I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History."
green,But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
ace,So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
green,This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
ace,"Phil, I can understand. You're in the finances, you're upstairs, but you are not on the floor. I got thousands of players. I got five hundred dealers.  They're all lookin' to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a day. I have to let them know I'm watching all the details, all the time; that there is not one single thing I will not catch as I am over here."
ace,Look at yours.
green,What?
ace,Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
green,What are you talking about?
ace,"It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done."
green,Where you goin'?
ace, From now on I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin. An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.
baker,You know how long that's going to take?
ace,I don't care how long it takes. Put an equal amount in each muffin.
ace,"Come on, honey, just a little. That a girl, that a girl. Oh, boy, look."
ace," Okay, want to go with Mommy?"
ace,What do you need?
ginger," Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual."
ace,"Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there."
ginger,"Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand."
ace,Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
ginger, Yeah.
ace,Why do you need that much?
ginger,"Well, what's the difference? I just need it."
ace,"Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean..."
ginger,I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
ace,"Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for."
ace,Why can't you tell me what it's for?
ace,"Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?"
ginger,No.
ace,"Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?"
ginger,"Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this."
ace,What are you talkin' a- ?
ginger, Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
ace,"You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?"
ginger, You can trust me.
ace,"Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for."
lester,"What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?"
ginger,It means I got the money.
lester,You got money. That's a - That's a good look.
ace,"How you doin', Les? It's Lester, right? Sam."
ace,"From my recollection, aren't you the card shark... the golf hustler... the pimp from Beverly Hills?"
ace,"If I'm wrong, please correct me, 'cause I never knew you to be a heist man.  But if you are, you know what... here, take mine too."
ace,"Go ahead, take it. 'Cause you already have hers."
ace,"She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me."
lester,"Yeah, yeah. I know that."
ace,"You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here."
lester, Okay.
ace,You fuckin' piece of shit.
lester,"Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's bullshit. You know, you know, what the fuck?"
ace,"You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?"
ginger," No, he didn't."
ace," Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.'"
ace,"Come here, I want to show you somethin'."
ginger,No! No! No! Don't!
ginger,Make them stop it!  No! No! No! It's not his fault! It's my fault!
ginger, No! No!
lester, Fuck!
lester,Fuck you!
lester," Couldn't do it yourself, you chickenshit cocksucker!"
ginger," He's such a prick. He had some guy from the hotel beat him up. He didn't want to do it himself. Oh, no, he didn't want to get his own hands dirty."
ginger,"So, why'd he have to do that, huh?"
ginger,Tell me.
nicky,I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
ginger," Yeah, no shit."
nicky,"Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you."
ginger,No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
nicky,"Oh, you did? I didn't know that."
ginger,"Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?"
nicky,"You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but..."
nicky,"I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does."
ginger,"Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end."
nicky,Sure.
ginger,Am I right?
nicky,I can see that. Sure.
ginger,"So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry."
nicky,"You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?"
ginger,"Mm, you want to steal it? "
nicky,"No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all."
ginger,"I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. "
nicky,"Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?"
ginger,I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  I mean it.
nicky,I know what you mean.
nicky,"Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace."
ginger,I do.
nicky,"I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens."
ginger,He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
ginger,He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
nicky,"Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried."
ginger, He gives a fuck what I do?
nicky," Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him."
ginger,Okay.
nicky,All right?
ginger,Yeah.  Thanks.
ginger,Thanks for puttin' up with me.
nicky,"And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse."
ginger,"Oh, come on."
nicky,You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
nicky,"Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy."
ginger, Thanks.
nicky,Yeah.
ginger, Thank you.
nicky, It's all right.
secretary, Mr Rothstein? County Commissioner Pat Webb is here to see you.
ace, Okay...
ace, ...give me a minute.
secretary, Okay.
secretary, It'll just be a minute.
secretary,Mr Webb...  Can I get you anything?
webb,"Oh, no.  No, thank you, little lady."
ace," Okay, send him in and call me four minutes after."
webb,Mr Rothstein...  I'm Pat Webb.
ace,How do you do?
webb,"Hey, it is my pleasure."
ace,"Yeah, I heard a lot about you."
webb,"Oh, thank you, sir."
webb,"Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant."
ace,"No, that's quite all right."
ace,Why don't you have a seat?
webb,"Hm? Oh. Thank you, sir."
webb,"Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired."
ace,"I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here."
webb,"Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges."
ace,"Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest."
webb,"Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?"
ace,"I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him."
webb," But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back."
ace,"I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that."
webb,"Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?"
ace," I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted."
ace," Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry."
webb,"Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time."
ace,No problem.  Sorry.
webb, You bet.
ace,What happened to my pills?
ginger,Huh?
ace," Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?"
ginger,I didn't take your pills.
ace,"Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?"
ginger, You didn't have to beat him up!
ace, What?
ginger, I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
ace,"Yeah, how do I know?"
ginger, You can't make me stop caring...
ace,What? What?!
ginger,"I said, you can't make me stop caring about people."
ace," Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -"
ginger, I am.
ace, ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
ginger,Okay.
ace,"If not for me, at least for Amy."
ginger," Okay, okay."
ace, You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
ginger,I don't need one.
ace,"Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff."
ginger,That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
ace," Yes, I - yes, I do."
ginger,"No, you don't."
ace,"How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it."
ginger," Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try."
ginger,"I'll try. I will. Don't be mad at me, okay... I will."
borelli,"Aspett'. [Italian-American slang for 'Wait'] Wait a minute. You mean to tell me that the money we're robbing is bein' robbed? That somebody's robbing from us?  We go through all this fuckin' trouble, and somebody's robbin' us?"
gaggi, Eh?
nance,"Like I said, you know, i-it's part of the business. I-it's considered leakage."
borelli,"Leakage, my balls. I want the guy who's robbin' us."
borelli,What's the point of skimming if we're being skimmed? Defeats the whole purpose of what we're doin' out there.
gaggi, Huh?
nance,"You know, they take this money because they're my guys. So you gotta give 'em some leeway."
borelli,What the hell have you been doin' out there?
piscano,I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
borelli,Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
piscano,What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]
borelli,"Artie, what the hell have you been doin' out there, Artie?"
piscano,I'm out there more than I'm here.
borelli,You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
piscano,"Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip."
borelli,What expenses?
piscano,"Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?"
borelli,You gotta go back out there.
piscano,"Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records."
borelli,"Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?"
piscano,"Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?"
borelli,"You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me."
green,I can't believe you're doing this.
scott,"We made a deal. You came to me, remember?"
green,"Yes, I appreciated your advice..."
green,Why are you doing this to me?
scott,Because you're wrong.
green,I'm not wrong.
scott,"Yes, you are."
green,"No, I am not wrong."
scott,And you're not going to get away with this! I will see to it that you do not get away with this!
judge,"The court will now hear the matter of the plaintiff, Anna Scott, against Tangiers Corporation and its president, Philip Green."
judge,"Mr Logan, you may proceed."
scott,I believe he was absolutely fair and I'm delighted with the decision.
nance, We got a problem.
nance, It didn't go too well.
nance," Green has to open up the books... has to show how he got the financing. And, hey, that's - that's not good."
gaggi,Shit.
green,What are you talking about?
green,We were - We were involved in minor real estate deals many years ago. It was never a partnership.
green,"I'm a little in shock, quite frankly..."
reporter,"So, actually, how often do you really fill in for him?"
sherbert," - with other real-estate deals and - and things, you know."
reporter," So, in Green's absence, then, you're the boss."
ace,"I serve at the pleasure of the chairman of the board and... my, uh, responsibilities are to run the day- to-day operations."
reporter,"So, day-to-day, then, you're the boss?"
ace,"Well, in a sense, you could say that... I am the boss, when Mr Green is away. You could say that."
webb,It says  You believe that?
duprey,Did he really say that?
webb,"Why, of course, he really said that. It's right here. Has that man even filed for his license yet?"
austin,I don't know. We'll have to check the files.
webb,"Well, without gettin' your shorts in a knot, would you do that? And kinda check closely, 'cause we may have to kick a kike's ass out of town.  Thank you."
newscaster, Could lose his ability to work in the casino.
ace, Hello.
nicky, Listen...
nicky, ...I gotta meet Clean Face right away. What about the Chez Paree?
super subtitle,"'I gotta meet Charlie the Banker right away at your house, okay?'"
ace," No, you, you can't. You gotta make a reservation."
ace, It's all booked up.
super subtitle,'I don't want a meeting at my house.'
nicky," No, no it's okay."
ace," It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's..."
ace, ...very difficult to get in.
nicky," Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine."
super subtitle,'I'll come in from the golf course side. See you at six.'
ace, Uh...
ace, ...all right.
newscaster, The battle between...
newscaster," ...state gaming officials and Tangiers Casino boss Sam 'Ace' Rothstein is heating up. Tonight, an up-to-the- minute look at Ace Rothstein's attempt to get state licensing despite law enforcement allegations of Rothstein's organized crime connections. Will Sam Rothstein's friendship with alleged organized crime figure Nicky Santoro keep Rothstein from running the Tangiers Casino?  And can the integrity of state gaming laws be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?"
ace, Why don't you take it easy with that stuff? Huh?  Come on. Let me help you. Come on. We're talkin' about some stuff.
newscaster, State officials say 'yes' when that relationship and those connections are with anyone as notorious as Nicky Santoro.
newscaster,Tonight at six: 'Will a boyhood friendship unseat Rothstein as the Tangiers' Casino boss?' Exclusive on the KVVO Special News Report.  ...Promise to keep my money fears away?
ace, Just go downstairs.  Just... go downst-
newscaster, Promise to be financially secure? Money Time can help you keep those promises.
charlie clark,"You can't let this concern you, Ace. Don't worry about that stuff."
nicky,"Hey, Ace."
ace,Hey.
ace,Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
charlie clark,"Yeah, refill'd be great."
nicky," Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?"
charlie clark, Hi. Good.
nicky, I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
charlie clark,"Well, I've been busy. "
nicky,"Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though."
charlie clark,"Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss."
nicky,Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
charlie clark, What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
nicky,"You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it."
charlie clark, You can't talk to me like...
nicky," Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep."
charlie clark, Sam?
nicky,"Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal.  I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso."
nicky,You fuckin' try me.
nicky,You think he got the point?
ace," What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI."
nicky,"Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time."
ace,"I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?"
nicky,"Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way."
ace,"Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?"
nicky,"Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?"
ace,"No, I don't wanna come -"
nicky,You should say so.
ace,I don't wanna come along with you.
nicky,Just say so.
ace,I'll be honest with you.
nicky,"All right, fine."
ace,I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
nicky,Fine.
ace,...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
nicky," You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?"
ace,That's all taken out of context. Okay.
nicky,"Yeah, that's out of context. Okay."
ace,I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
nicky,"Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad."
ace,Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
nicky,Yeah?
ace,Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
nicky,What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
ace,What happened to me? What happened to you?
nicky,Yeah.
ace,You lost your control.
nicky,I lost control?
ace,"Yes, you lost your control."
nicky,Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
ace,All right.
nicky,A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
ace,All right.
nicky,"...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!"
ace,Yeah.
nicky,"You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife."
ace,My wife?
nicky,Yeah.
ace,"Now, what does she have to do with all this?"
nicky,"Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident."
ace,"All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?"
nicky,"No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point."
ace,"Listen, I would -"
nicky, The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
ace,"I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you."
nicky,"Hey, she came to talk..."
ace,Please...
nicky,...to me.
ace,...don't do it to me...
nicky,She came to talk to me...
ace,Okay?
nicky,"And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?"
ace,"Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that."
nicky,It's none of my business?
ace,"That's right, yeah."
nicky,"A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me."
ace,"Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy."
ace,This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
nicky,"Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal."
nicky, Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
nicky, Watch yourself. You're gonna get runned over there.
nicky," Come on, huh. That's enough now. Be nice, huh? Be nice."
gaggi, Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
marino,"Yeah, I heard, yeah."
gaggi,Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
marino,I know.
gaggi,It's in all the papers.
marino,What're you gonna do?
gaggi,And I mean... that's no good.
marino,I know.
gaggi,You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
marino,"I'll tell him, Remo."
nicky," But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back."
marino,"Yeah, but they're complaining."
nicky,Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
nicky,"I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him."
marino,It's up to you.
nicky,"They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready."
nicky,"I know one thing. All I gotta do is take care of four or five of those fuckin' guys, the rest will fall right into place. Believe me."
nicky,"I see you, you motherfuckers."
nicky,"Practice enough this week, you prick?"
austin,A record of the arrests...
ace,"That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches."
austin,"You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission."
ace,"Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a fair hearing."
duprey,"Well, this kind of honesty will guarantee that fair hearing."
ace,Good.
austin,"All right, well, we'll move on to -"
nicky," What the fuck is this? Where's this fuckin' guy gonna land, on the fairway?"
nicky," They're fuckin' agents, Frankie. Look at this."
nicky,"A hundred dollars, whoever hits the plane."
piscano,"They're fightin' over those suitcases again. You know what that means, right? You know what that means, right? That means I gotta take another trip out to Vegas, and it's gonna cost me another couple of grand."
piscano,"They're not gonna make a fool out of me. I write it all down in this book,  every fuckin' nickel that goes down. Right here, receipts..."
piscano's mother, Hey! Oh!
piscano,"Oh, sorry -"
piscano's mother,What's the matter with you?
piscano,Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
piscano's mother,Since when do you talk like that?
piscano,I'm sorry.
piscano's mother,There's a lot of people here.
piscano,Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
piscano's mother,Again!
piscano,I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
piscano's mother,That's enough.
piscano,I'm sorry.
piscano,"Plus, what's to prevent him with the suitcases, that he can take what he wants?  Fuckin' Nance, he brings us back two suitcases from the Tangiers, and what about three or four?"
piscano,"We got nobody in the room to watch. That's the law. You know, we can't even go into the count room to watch our money? Could you believe this cowboy bullshit?"
piscano,"And sure he's got his people in there. But how do you know? They could all be in on it together, those miserable fucks."
piscano,"I'll find out and, if it's Green himself, I'll bury that bastard."
piscano, I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
piscano,"...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel."
piscano's mother,"All right, take it easy now, take it easy."
piscano,"Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset."
piscano's mother," I know, but that's enough."
piscano,You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
piscano's mother,"I know it, I know it."
piscano,"I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth."
piscano's mother,"Take it easy, though."
piscano,"All right, all right. But I - I -"
piscano's mother,You'll get a heart attack like that.
piscano,"You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this."
piscano," ...did years ago, start kickin' ass, I - I'll do it, and I'll use the goddamn shovel!  I mean, I..."
piscano's mother, You are right.
piscano," ...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth."
piscano's mother, You are right. What can I...
piscano's mother, ...tell you.
piscano," I'm in this to make money, not to lose money.  And..."
piscano, Because...
piscano, ...if you want somethin'...
piscano," ...done right, you gotta do it yourself."
piscano's mother, Then do it the way you want.
piscano's mother, What can I tell you?
ace,...sunk the whole world.
piscano's mother, That's the way people are. There are some that are good and some that are bad.
oscar,Mr Chairman and members of the Commission. Mr Rothstein is pleased to be here today.
oscar,"...evidence... and we have documents, one of which is a report by retired FBI agents, which completely absolves  Mr Rothstein from any wrongdoing. I'd like this marked, please, Mr Chairman."
senator," Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue..."
oscar,"No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -"
senator," ...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application."
oscar,Denying?
senator, Do I hear a motion seconded?
oscar,Mr. Chairman -
senator, Do I have a vote on the motion?
oscar,Mr. Chairman -
senator, The ayes have it. This hearing is adjourned.
ace, You guys have to be kidding.
ace,"Adjourned! What do you mean, adjourned?"
oscar,"Mr. Chairman, please."
ace,Mr. Chairman...
ace,"Senator, you promised me a hearing."
ace,You won't allow me a hearing? You didn't even look at the FBI reports.
ace,"When you were my guest, Mr. Chairman, Senator, at the Tangiers Hotel, did you not promise me that I would have a fair hearing -"
senator, I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers.
ace,You were never my guest?!
senator, That's right.
ace,I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
senator," Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time."
ace,Liar.
senator, Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
ace,He's lying.
senator,The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
ace,Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
senator,You were wandering around.
ace,Was I at that dinner?
senator,You were wandering around.
ace,Was I at that dinner?
senator,You were wandering around.
ace,Was I at that dinner?
senator,You were in the m- You were in the building.
ace,I was in the building!
ace,"You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Give me that much at least!"
senator," Yes, you were."
ace,"Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a"
female newscaster," ...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption."
ace," What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?"
ace, Don't you remember? You promised me a fair hearing when you were gettin' comped at my hotel and you were asking me for copies of your bills so -
ace,- you could put 'em on your expense account?
ace, Bullshit! Bullshit!
ace," We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me."
ace, ...twenty years in order to find nothin' on me -
ace,- unsubstantiated truths on me. And if you look at your own lives you'd all be in jail.
gaggi,What the hell's he gonna do now?
stone,I don't know 
gaggi,"What's he doin'? He knows all those guys he yelled at are friends of ours. What's the matter with him, making all this mess?"
stone,"Maybe he could run things with another job title. Wouldn't be the best, but, uh, what are we gonna do?"
gaggi,"However he runs things, it's gotta be quiet. Let him hide upstairs in the office. Say he's the janitor, I don't give a shit. But, please, whatever job he takes, make sure it's something quiet."
trudy, ...Sasha Semenoff Orchestra...
trudy,...and the Sam Rothstein Dancers.
trudy,Mr Rothstein is a professional gambler and the best football handicapper...

ace, That's amazing.
frankie avalon, It was my pleasure.
green,"Ace, don't do it."
green,"Oh, no, no. No, no. Oh, Jesus... he's juggling!"
ace," I recently challenged him to a debate on this program and he declined. What are you worried about, Pat? You don't have to send me any questions. You can ask me anything you want."
stone,"He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind."
ace, ...state that we have such hypocrisy. Some people can do whatever they want. Other people have to pay through the nose.
gaggi,"Andy, go see him. Tell him maybe it's time he should quit."
ace,"First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year."
stone,These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
ace,"Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?"
stone,"The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!"
ace,"Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?"
stone,What do you propose?
ace,"I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?"
stone,They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
ace,"All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying."
stone,I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
ace, I can't do that.
jennifer," You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis."
jennifer, Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
ginger, One o'clock?

fbi agent," Okay, pulled out..."
nicky,Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
ace,What people?
nicky,"What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?"
ace,"I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick."
nicky,"No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!"
ace,"I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem."
nicky,You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
ace,"Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass."
nicky,"Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!"
ace,I -
nicky, I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
ace,What are you -
nicky, You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
ace,I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
nicky,Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
ace,"Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right."
nicky,You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
ace,"Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you."
nicky,"Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?"
ace,"No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told..."
nicky, Back -
ace,...you? Do you remember what I told you?
nicky,"Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -"
ace, You never - ?
nicky,"Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!"
marino,"Well, we got company."
nicky,"Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to."
dominick,Yeah. Fuck him.
sherbert,To Abraham Lincoln.
ace,L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
sherbert,Here we go. Good luck.
dominick,"Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you."
nicky,"Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem?"
marino,Mm.
nicky,"Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?"
marino,They're havin' a good time too.
nicky,So are we.
ace, Yeah?
sherbert," Sam, we got a problem."
ace, What is it?
sherbert," The little guy. He's half in the bag, and nobody told him he was eighty- sixed from the joint, so we..."
sherbert, ...all turned our heads and made out like we didn't know who he was. He's over at the twenty-one table with his...
sherbert,...nose wide open. He took the money out of his own kick. His nose is open for about ten thousand.
ace," Oh, no."
sherbert, He wants a fifty-thousand marker.
ace," No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down."
sherbert," He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted."
nicky,"Ten thou? No, no, no."
sherbert,...give you ten thousand -
nicky, Fifty! I said fifty!
sherbert,"Look, take -"
nicky," Fuckers!  They take it, but they don't want to give it back."
nicky,How the fuck can you grin? How the fuck could you grin?
nicky,You know how much I'm stuck? You give a fuck?
nicky,Do ya?!

nicky,Take this one and stick it up your sister's ass! Hit me again.
nicky,"That's it, keep lookin' at him, you fuckin' dummy. If you had any fuckin' heart at all, you'd be out fuckin' stealin' for a livin'.  Hit me again."
nicky,"What the fuck you keep lookin' at him for, huh, you fuckin' pu-"
nicky,"Look at this, twenty fuckin' paints in a row. Hit me again!"
marino, He's here.
nicky," You should pay as fast as you collect, you know."
ace,What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here!
nicky,"Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker."
ace,"Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both."
nicky,"Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy."
ace,"I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you."
ace,Ten and that's it.
nicky,"What are you starin' at, you bald- headed Jew prick?!"
nicky,"Sue me, you Jew fuck!"
marino,Let's get out of here.
nicky,What? Get out of here? I got a marker comin'.
nicky, Deal.
oscar,"I know, but everything's changed now. You're talking about a divorce. You're even asking for alimony payments and... child support... and now custody."
ginger,I just want what any divorced woman would get.
ace,"I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I -"
ginger," He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave."
ace, Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.
ace,You know me. Do you see anything in these eyes that makes you think I would ever let someone in your condition take my child away from me?  Do you?  You know that won't happen.
ace, Everything all right?
ace,"I mean, what could we do? After a while, we'd just take breathers from each other. You know, little separations. At that time, I remember Ginger took Amy and went to Beverly Hills. She was gonna spend a week or so shopping."
operator," Yes, Mr Rothstein."
ace," Operator, the Beverly Hotel in Beverly Hills, please."
lester,Hey.
ace," M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?"
lester," Hey, little Dale Evans."
ace, Hello.
forlano, Yeah.
ace," Uh, my wife is w-with an old friend of her i-in LA."
ace, Some low-life. A guy named Lester Diamond.
ace, My daughter's with 'em too and I think they're gonna try and kidnap her. Is there anybody you can send?
forlano, We'll take care of it.
ace, Hello.
lester, Hello.
ace," Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam..."
ace,...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
lester," She's not here, Sam."
ace, Lester...
ace, ...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
ace, I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
lester," Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't..."
lester,"...wouldn't do it. Yeah, no, I, I..."
ginger, You shouldn't do this.
ace, You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
lester," Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?"
lester," So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?"
lester,"Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-"
ace, Right away.
lester, I'll call you right back.
ace, Right back.
lester, All right. I just bought us a few minutes. Want to get back at this prick?
lester,"Hm?  Okay, you got, what, two million dollars in that box?"
lester,"Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-"
amy, I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
lester,"We're not gonna go see any fuckin' elephants, okay?"
ginger, We'll go later.
lester," You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?"
amy,I don't want to go to Europe.
lester, Shut your mouth!
lester,You know where she gets this from!
amy,You shut up.
lester,"No, you - You want me to come over there? I'll smack your face."
lester,"Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going."
ginger,Lester - he called you here.
lester,Right.
ginger,Here.
lester,He was just on the phone.
ginger, He called you right here.
lester,I just talked to him.
ginger," So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now."
lester,"Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -"
ginger," That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -"
lester, He's sittin' by the phone -
ginger, What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
ginger," Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!"
lester,"It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know."
ginger," Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?"
lester,"You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?"
ginger, Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
lester, 'Go! Go! Go!'
nicky," You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?"
ginger," No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me."
nicky," You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do."
ginger," Yeah, uh-huh... Okay."
ginger," So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?"
nicky, I'll be there.
nicky," And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay."
ginger, Bye.
ginger,Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
lester,She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
lester,You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.
ginger,"No, I'm gonna drive."
lester," No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -"
ginger, You're driving me nuts!
lester,Get in the passenger's side! And I'm sendin' this kid to Bolivia in a fuckin' box.
nicky,Ginger -
nicky, Ginger called me.
ace, Yeah.
nicky,I just told you. She called me.
ace,And what'd she want?
nicky,She was afraid to call you.
ace,"Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy."
ginger,"Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out."
ace,"Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?"
nicky,"I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?"
ace, She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
nicky,"I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back."
ace,She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
nicky,"Well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know?  But get the kid back here. She wants to come back. That's the, uh, that's the main thing here. You want your kid, don't you? Huh?"
ace, Hello.
ginger," Just who you wanted to talk to, right?"
ace, Listen...
ace," ...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away..."
ace, ...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
ginger, Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
ace, What do you mean?
ginger," What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?"
ace," I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know."
ginger, Right.
ginger, I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
ace," What about the money? Uh, where's the box?"
ginger, I gotta tell ya...
ginger, ...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
ace, What's it...
ace, ...under?
ginger, Pretty serious.
ace, How serious?
ginger,"It's, uh, it's under twenty-five."
ace, It's under...
ace, ...twenty-five thousand?
ginger, Yeah.
ace, And...
ace, ...the rest of the two million is still there?
ginger," Yeah, yeah, I got the rest."
ace, That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
ginger, Okay?
ace, All right...
ace, ...all right. Where are you? I'll send a plane for you right away.
ginger," Hi, Sam."
ace,"So, what'd ya do with it?"
ginger,With what?
ace,With the money.
ginger,He needed some clothes.
ace, Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
ginger,"He wanted a watch, too."
ace,Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
ginger,Mm-hm.
ace,Mm-hm.
ginger,Gino.
ace," First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much."
ginger,I bought him a watch too.
ace,Yeah.
ginger,Yeah.
ace,"But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?"
ginger,Yeah.
ace,"At the most, which is impossible for him."
ace,"Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?"
ginger," Would you knock it off, Sam?"
ace,I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
ginger,There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
ace,"Yeah, but I've been told that before, 'We're workin' it out.' You think that you're home... after what you just put me through with Amy, is a favor to me?"
ace," So, counting the watch, let's say another four thousand for expenses over the weekend... of which you must have had a good time. I know he did.  That's for sure. I know that... fuckin' piece of shit had a good fuckin' time. On my money. You might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway."
ace,"You're lookin' at me a certain way. You - you're teary-eyed, huh? You're upset. You're a good actress, you know that?  Good fuckin' actress. You can fuckin' get that pity out of people. I'm not a john, you understand?  You always thought I was, but I'm not. And I'm not a sucker. That fuckin' pimp cocksucker. He's lucky I didn't kill him last time. Lucky he's fuckin' livin'. And if you would've stayed with Amy... and you would've ran away... you would've been fuckin' dead."
ace,Both of you. Dead. Dead.
ginger," I want to have him killed. Yes, I want him killed.  I've fuckin' had it."
ginger," So, are you with me on this?"
ace,"You want to get rid of me? Here I am. Go ahead, get rid of me  Hello."
ginger, Yes! I fuckin' hate you! I can't take it anymore!
ginger,"Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!"
ace,You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
ginger,Get off of me! Stop it!
ace,Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
ace,I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
ginger, Let go of me! Let go of me!
ace,Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!
ginger,"I'll go, but I want my money right now!"
ace,You'll get your money! Don't worry.
ginger,The arrangement is over!
ace, No kidding. NO KIDDING!
ginger,And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
ace,"I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place!  I need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch!"
ginger,Love you?!
ginger,How could I love you?! How can I love you?! You treat me like I'm your fucking dog!
ace,You're lower than a dog!
ginger,Fuck you!
ace, Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
ginger,I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
ace,"Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!"
ginger,And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
ace,"I guarantee you, I will not stop you."
ginger,Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
ace,You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
ginger,Fine.  I'm takin' Amy.
ace, You're not takin' Amy.
ginger,I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
ace,You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
ginger,I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
ace,Get out of here!
ace,Send my lawyers a letter.  God-fuckin'-damn you!
ginger,Fucker! 
ace, Oh. Have a good day at school.
amy,Okay.
ace,"Okay? Okay, angel."
ace," From now on, I have to know where you and Amy are at all times."
ace," Now, here's a beeper. I want you to keep it on you. It's very light.  So I can call you whenever I have to."
ace, Okay?
nicky,"I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -"
ginger," Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -"
nicky,What? What?
ginger,Nothin'.
nicky,What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
ginger,I don't - 
nicky,Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
ginger,Yeah?
nicky,Yeah.
ginger,"Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out."
nicky, Let me think about that.
ginger,Okay.
nicky,See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
ginger,Mm-hm.
nicky,You know?
ginger,"Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry."
nicky,Hm.
ginger,"He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass."
nicky," Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too."
ginger,He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
nicky,"No, he wouldn't. I would have.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off."
ginger," I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back."
nicky,You did. You're right.
ginger,Exactly.
nicky,You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
ginger, I did what you told me to.
nicky,"Yes, you did."
ginger,'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
nicky,Yeah.  - didn't he?
ginger,Sure did.
nicky,Everything went to his head. 
nicky,"He did. He ain't the same person, right?"
ginger," No, he's not."
nicky,"He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that."
ginger, He hates me.
ginger,He hates my fuckin' guts.
nicky,"Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry."
ginger, I'm not as tough as you think I am.
nicky,"Yes, you are."
ginger, I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
nicky, Come on. Don't be scared.
ginger," You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky."
ginger, I do. I need a new sponsor.
nicky, Is that what you want?
ginger,Yeah.
nicky,A sponsor.
ginger,Yeah.
nicky,Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
ginger," Nicky, please..."
nicky,"Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?"
ginger," Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
nicky,It's what you want?
ginger,Yeah. Uh-huh -
ginger,Hi.
ace,Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
ginger,I threw it away.
ace,You threw it away?
ginger, Where's Amy?
ace,I put her to bed.
ginger,Oh.  I got your cigarettes.
ginger,Oscar wants you to call him.
ace,"So, who'd you go to lunch with?"
ginger,With Jennifer.
ace,And where'd you go?
ginger,To the Riviera.
ace, What'd you have?
ginger,I had a... salad.
ace,What did Jennifer have?
ginger, She had the same.
ace," Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line."
ginger,Why do you want to do that?
ace,You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
ginger,Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
ace,Mm.
ginger,The line's busy. There's nobody there.
jennifer, Hello.
ace," Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -"
ginger,All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
ace, Who were you with?
ginger, I was with somebody.
ace,I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not them.
ace,What if he won't stop?
ginger,I can back him off.
nicky,"Hey, Ginger... don't forget, if you're challenged, you know, if he asks anything, deny everything.  Do you understand? I don't want him bringin' beefs back home ... 'cause that could be a problem. You gotta be careful. He's not dumb, you know? You hear what I'm sayin', right?"
ginger,"I know. You don't have to tell me that. What do you think,  I'm stupid?"
nicky,"Do I think you're stupid? No, I think you're beautiful.  But I gotta go."
gaggi,It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
marino,"Of course, Remo."
gaggi,"I want you to tell me the truth, mind you."
marino,"I always tell you the truth, Remo."
gaggi,"Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem."
marino, No. I ain't see anything like that.
gaggi,Are you sure?
marino,"I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?"
gaggi,"Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky."
marino,Hm.
gaggi,I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
marino,He's good. He's fine.
gaggi,"I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me."
marino,No problem.
gaggi,You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
marino,I understand.
gaggi,"Okay.  Frankie, you're a good boy."
marino,"Thanks, Remo."
marino, You must have drunk too much.
nicky,Go fuck yourself.
blue," Hey, what do you guys want out of my life, huh?"
blue,"Hey, fuck you!"
marino,He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
nicky,"Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?"
marino,He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
nicky,"Yeah, what'd you tell him?"
marino,"I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up."
nicky,"You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?"
marino,Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
nicky,"Yeah, what's to stop him?"
marino,I know. I know.
nicky,"I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?"
marino,"Yeah, but they keep askin' about it."
nicky,"Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?"
marino,What?
nicky,Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
marino,"Oh, he ain't nobody."
nicky,"You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at."
marino,Angelo and Buster.
nicky,"Yeah, but I'm not sure yet."
marino,They'll do it.
nicky,"And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'"
marino,Yeah.
nicky,"And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?"
marino,"Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?"
nicky,Did I say to do anything yet? I said I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I want to think about it. Where're these pricks at?
marino,Don't know.
nicky,Dominick said they're in the motel?
marino,"Yeah, either that or in the fuckin' bank. I don't know. They're all over the joint."
ace, Be right back. I'll be right back.
ace,"Rudy, any calls for me, just give 'em to Mr Sherbert. I'll be right back."
rudy,"Sure, Mr Rothstein. You'll be back...?"
ace,I'm going home for a few seconds. I'll be right back.
rudy, He's on his way home.

nicky,She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
ace,"Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch."

ginger," Why don't you just let me go, Sam?"
