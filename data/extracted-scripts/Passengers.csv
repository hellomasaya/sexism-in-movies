Speaker,Dialogue
cafeteria,"Super-modern and gleaming. Hundreds of tables, all empty."
hibernation bay,"Endless corridors lined with vertical glass tubes. Inside each tube stands a PASSENGER. Eyes closed in sleep. If they're breathing you can't tell by looking. They sleep on their feet, leaning against padded supports. Straps secure them in place; sensors adhere to their skin. They wear shorts and tank tops with HomeStead Company logos. We survey their faces. No children, no senior citizens. Men and women of every ethnicity in the prime of their lives. We settle on one man. JIM PRESTON, 38. Sound asleep. A small display on his pod reads:"
james preston,"Rate 2 Mechanical Engineer Denver, Colorado "
video stewardess,"Good Morning, James!"
video stewardess,"Don't worry, Jim. It's normal to feel confused. You've just spent a hundred and twenty years in suspended animation. She makes it sound sexy. Jim scowls and rubs his eyes. ONSCREEN - An animation. Happy people go to sleep in glass tubes in a hospital. The tubes are loaded onto a spaceship."
video stewardess,The Excelsior is on final approach.
jim,Right.
elevator foyer,"Jim finds a bank of elevators. As he approaches, the indicators blink on. An elevator opens, spilling light. He steps inside, and muzak begins to play."
deck seven,"A corridor lined with doors. A CLEANING ROBOT vacuums. Jim appears. Instantly the corridor lights brighten. The cleaning robot rolls past Jim.  CLEANING ROBOT Hello, Passenger.  JIM   Hello, robot. Jim follows wall markings to his cabin. Lets himself in."
jim's cabin,"Cozy but small. A bed, a desk, an armchair. No window. A SCREEN lights up. The HomeStead Company theme music plays. An ANNOUNCER speaks. "
cargo robot,Passenger James Preston?
jim,Jim. Yeah.
cargo robot,"Your luggage, Passenger Jim. Swipe your shipcard to confirm. Jim swipes his shipcard through a slot on top of the robot. The robot scoots inside and deposits Jim's bags on the floor."
jim,Thanks.
cargo robot,"Thank you, Passenger Jim! The robot zips out the door. Jim looks up and down the corridor. The receding robot is the only sign of life. He steps back inside."
announcer,Your group's orientation starts in forty-five minutes. Join them in Conference Room Twenty on Deck One. Don't forget!
video instructor,"Hello, Passengers. Will you all please take a seat. Jim looks around. He's the only one there. He sits."
jim, Can I just...
video instructor,"No questions until the end, please."
jim,Wait. Where are all the other...
video instructor,The Colonies offer an alternative. A better way of life.
video instructor,"...thriving job markets in mining, farming and manufacturing. An explosion in the cultural arts. And if you long for the life less civilized, you can apply for a pioneer permit and seek your fortune in the wild.  Any questions?"
video instructor,We're all on the Starship Excelsior. Five thousand passengers and fifty- eight crew members.
jim,But I'm the only one awake.
video instructor,"No, all the passengers wake up at the same time."
jim,Then something's wrong with the other hibernation pods.
video instructor,Hibernation pods are fail-safe.
jim,So why am I the only one here?
video instructor,I'm sorry. I don't understand your question.
grand concourse,Jim finds an INFOMAT - an information kiosk. A banner scrolls across the screen: ASK ME A QUESTION! Jim taps the screen.
jim,I need to talk to a person. A real live person.
infomat,What sort of person? Personal trainer? Travel planner? Therapist?
jim,Someone in charge.
infomat,The Ship Steward handles passenger affairs. You can find him in his office on the Service Deck. ONSCREEN: A dotted line on the map shows how to get there.
jim,Thank you.
infomat,Happy to help!
elevator lobby,Another Infomat. Jim arrives at a jog. 
infomat,Hello! What's your quest...
jim,Who's flying the ship?
infomat,"The bridge crew includes the Captain, the Pilot, the Chief Navigator..."
jim,The Captain. I want to talk to the Captain.
infomat,The Captain rarely handles passenger queries directly.
jim,"Emergency, okay? Where is he?"
infomat,"The Captain is usually found on the Bridge, on the Command Deck. ONSCREEN: A helpful map shows the way. Jim marches off."
command deck,Jim finds the door to the Bridge. He opens it eagerly - only to find a second door behind it - an armored hatch labeled FIREWALL and SECURE ACCESS AREA. A porthole of thick glass gives a narrow view of the Bridge. It's deserted. Instrument lights gleam in the dark.
jim, Come on! What the hell is happening?
jim, Hello? Hello!
jim," Hello! A SOUND behind him makes him spin. But it's just a window-washer: a robot with long spindly limbs. It moves past Jim, polishing windows. Oblivious. A sign catches Jim's attention: ""OBSERVATORY - Your Place In the Universe."""
observatory,"Jim enters the planetarium of the future: theater seats facing a holographic ""stage."" IN HOLOGRAM: An image of the starship hangs in space. Glowing text reads ""Look through the eyes of the Starship Excelsior!"" Jim goes to the control podium. Touches the screen."
observatory, What can I show you?
jim,"We're supposed to land pretty soon, but it looks like I'm the only one awake. Is that normal?"
observatory,I don't understand. What can I show you?
observatory,Homestead II is the fourth planet in the Bhakti system.
jim,Right. And how soon are we landing?
observatory,Approximately ninety years.
jim,What?
observatory,"We land on Homestead II in ninety years, three weeks, and one day."
jim,No. How long ago did we leave Earth?
observatory,Approximately thirty years ago. Jim stares at the hologram in horrified realization.
jim,I woke up too soon.
observatory,I don't understand.
jim,Neither do I.
hibernation bay,"Jim sprints down a row of hibernation pods. Heart pounding. Slides to a stop in front of his empty pod. Jim fusses with the controls, pressing buttons. But the screen just reads ""PASSENGER DISCHARGED."" Crouching, he pulls at the pod's canopy, trying to open it with his hands. It doesn't budge."
jim,I'm supposed to be in there!
jim,How do I make a phone call?
infomat,Your cabin telephone...
jim,No. Long distance. How do I send a message to Earth?
infomat,Interstellar messages are sent by laser array. Speak to the Duty Officer in the Comm Center. ONSCREEN: The Infomat displays a helpful map.
infomat,Happy to help!
communications booth,Planet and connection?
jim,Earth. The HomeStead Company.
communications booth,"There are thirty thousand phone numbers listed under ""HomeStead Company."" What number?"
jim,I don't know. I'm emigrating to Homestead II. I have an emergency.
communications booth,"Division of Colonial Affairs, Homestead II Program. I have a Customer Help Line."
jim,Sounds about right.
communications booth,Begin message. Jim's a deer in the headlights. He collects himself.
jim,"Hi. I'm Jim Preston. I'm a passenger on the Excelsior. Something went wrong with my hibernation pod and I woke up too soon. Ninety years too soon. I can't get back to sleep. Nobody else is awake.  I'll keep trying to fix this. Maybe I missed something simple. But I could use a hand. Thanks. Jim pushes the ""SEND"" button. Sits back in his chair."
communications booth,Message sent.
jim,Outstanding.
communications booth,Message will arrive in nineteen years.
jim,Say what?
communications booth,Earliest possible reply in fifty-five years.
jim,No.
communications booth,"We are nineteen light years from Earth. By the time your message arrives, we will be thirty-six light- years from Earth. We apologize for the delay."
communications booth,That will be six thousand dollars.
grand concourse,Jim crosses the Concourse like a sleepwalker in his robe and slippers. He looks shell-shocked. He comes to the Concourse Bar: the fanciest watering hole on the ship. Black leather stools along a marble bartop. Jim touches the bartop...and a MAN swings up behind the bar - as if mounted on a hinge. A handsome fellow in a bartender's uniform - his hair and skin eerily perfect. This is ARTHUR. Jim jumps out of his skin.
arthur,What can I get you?
jim,I thought I was the only one awake!
arthur,"I doubt it. It's the middle of the afternoon. Are you drinking or not? He produces a cloth and polishes the bartop. In a startling movement, he glides the length of the bar, polishing all the way, and glides back as if on roller skates. Jim steps up on the footrail and peers behind the bar. Arthur's body stops at the waist. He's mounted on rails, built into the bar."
arthur,"Android, technically. Arthur's the name."
jim, I'm Jim. Arthur shakes his hand.
arthur,Pleased to meet you. What'll it be?
jim,"Whiskey, neat."
arthur,I don't know. I know some things.
jim,What do I do if my hibernation pod malfunctions?
arthur,Impossible. Hibernation pods are fail- safe.
jim,"Yeah, well, I woke up early."
arthur,Can't happen.
arthur,Ninety years or so.
jim,And when are all of us passengers supposed to wake up?
arthur,Not until the last two months.
jim,So how can I be sitting here with ninety years to go? Arthur's eyes take on a faraway look. His head twitches.
arthur,It's not possible for you to be here. He smiles as if he's solved the problem.
jim,But I am.
arthur,"Sorry, Jim. My specialty is cocktails and conversation. Take your fancy trick questions to one of those Infomats. They think they know everything.  JIM Arthur, I'm in trouble. I'm screwed. I am completely, ridiculously screwed.  ARTHUR Lot of self-pity.  JIM Self pity? I'm going to die of old age on this ship!  ARTHUR Jim, we all die. Even androids end up on the scrap heap. It's not dying that matters, it's living. This is your life. Are you going to live it or lie down and die? Jim shakes his head in surrender.  JIM What do I owe you?  ARTHUR Jim, the booze is on the house."
cafeteria,"Machines offer food and drink in dizzying variety. Each machine has a card slot and a screen displaying its menu. Jim enters, dressed in his own clothes - jeans, a T-shirt. "
coffee machine,"Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme is reserved for gold-class passengers. Please select another item. Jim presses one button after another, denied each time."
jim,Are you serious?
coffee machine,Please enjoy.
elevator,"Jim ascends, sipping coffee and eating an egg sandwich. The doors open at the Command Deck. A sign reads ""Crew Area - No Passengers beyond this point."" Jim breezes past the sign."
command deck,"Jim prowls the floor, opening doors. He finds a room marked EMERGENCY GEAR and opens it eagerly. It's full of space suits and oxygen tanks. He peers into a red HAZARD cabinet: fire extinguishers, an axe, an epoxy foamer for atmosphere leaks - all behind glass. He opens another door marked EMERGENCY MANUALS - and smiles: shelf after shelf of waterproof, fireproof technical manuals. Jim pulls a manual labeled HIBERNATION SYSTEMS."
hibernation bay,"Jim sits in front of his empty hibernation pod. His toolbox beside him. The Hibernation Systems manual lies open. Jim tinkers with the electronics inside his pod. The pod hums to life. Its data screen flickers with information. Mysterious WHIRS and THUNKS. The canopy opens. Elated, Jim bounces to his feet. Strips off his shirt and scrambles in. The canopy closes over him. He assumes the position, his back against the backrest, waiting for the pod to put him to sleep. Nothing happens. He pokes at the ports where the sensors and intravenous lines used to protrude. Shakes the machine. He gives up. It's not working. But now he's trapped inside the pod. He pushes at the canopy, but it's locked shut. He pounds on the glass with no effect. Finally he loses it, shouting and stamping, hammering and raging - all muffled behind glass. Exhausted, he sinks to the floor of the pod, staring out at his tools and his manual, his discarded shirt. Then he notices the emergency release handle down by the floor. He pulls it, and the canopy pops open."
jim,I thought I'd figure something out. I thought it would just come to me.
arthur,Stands to reason.
jim,But I've tried everything.
arthur,Sometimes you can't catch a break. Jim gives Arthur a thoughtful look.
jim,"I'm your only customer, but you're always polishing a glass."
arthur,Trick of the trade. Makes people nervous when a bartender just stands there.
jim,Okay. Lay some bartender wisdom on me. I'm lost in space here. Arthur polishes the bar while he thinks that one over.
arthur,You're not where you want to be. You feel like you're supposed to be somewhere else. Right?
jim,You said it.
arthur,"Well, here's the thing. Say you could snap your fingers and be wherever you wanted to be. Back on Earth, or on Homestead II."
jim,Okay.
arthur,"I'll bet even if you got your wish, you'd still feel this way. Not in the right place. Supposed to be somewhere else. That's not a crisis, it's the human condition. Jim takes a moment to consider that."
jim,That's not me.
arthur,"Well, maybe not. The point is, you can't get so wrapped up in where you'd rather be that you forget to make the most of where you are."
jim,What are you telling me?
arthur,"It's a big ship. You're always running around banging on things and yelling at the computers. Take a break. Live a little. Jim spins on his barstool, surveying the Grand Concourse."
jim,Live a little. When he comes back around he gives a shove. He spins faster.
arthur,That's the spirit. Jim goes for one more shove. Misses. Falls off his stool.
berlin suite,"High ceilings, posh furniture, panoramic windows. The door jumps in its frame with a THUNK. Slides open. Jim enters, a crowbar in hand. A cargo robot follows him in, carrying his toolbox and suitcases. It deposits them on the floor."
cargo robot,The Berlin Suite! Enjoy your luggage!
spa,Jim lies on a massage table wearing a towel. A pair of robot arms emerge from the table and begin to massage him.
z factor,Jim Preston! Welcome to the cutting edge of gaming! The greatest challenge you will ever know!
jim,All right then. He clambers into the cockpit.
jim,Yes!
z factor, Begin! IN HOLOGRAM: A fortress shines on a hilltop. War machines crawl over a blasted land. Letters flash: LEVEL ONE.
z-factor,You are victorious!
jim,Yes!
z-factor,You are the Grand Master of Z Factor!
jim,Another margarita!
jim,I am beginning to learn.
jim, [I be study the Russian.]
arthur, [Good for you! It's a beautiful language.]
jim,You speak Russian!
arthur,Of course. We have Russian passengers.
jim,"Well, I'm trying new things. From now on, every time I sit down, I want a drink I haven't had before."
arthur,"Fair enough. Arthur mixes a bright green drink, sets it in front of Jim. Jim takes a sip and makes a horrible face."
jim,What's that?
arthur,Something new.
jim, [I'm ready for today's new drink]
arthur," [I'm afraid I can't help you, my friend.] Jim thumps his fist on the bar."
jim," [Don't argue with me, robot. Give me a new drink.]"
jim,What do you mean?
arthur,"I can make two thousand, seven hundred and thirty-eight cocktails. You've had them all. The news hits Jim like a death in the family."
jim,There are no new drinks.
traveling shot,"The robot carries Jim up and down the Celestial Promenade. Down an elevator. Past the Concourse Bar. Jim waves. Arthur waves back, speechless."
deck one,The robot heads into a low hatch. Jim ducks to fit through. 
robotics center,"A mechanical hive. Here the ship's robots are cleaned, repaired, recharged. Robots bustle everywhere - never colliding, never getting lost. A ballet. Jim's sweeper robot vomits its load of collected dirt into a waste chute. Heads into a recharging niche. Jim jumps off. He explores: it's an engineer's fantasia. Jim's eyes show signs of life. But it's a hazardous place, with cranes and platforms, hoses and blowtorches on the move. He exits through another low hatch to find himself in the..."
hibernation bay,"Thousands of sleepers in their glass tubes. Jim walks among them, looking at their faces. Suddenly he stops, staring. Inside a pod, a woman stands sleeping. This is AURORA DUNN. A breathtaking beauty."
jim,"Who are you?  Aurora. He moves on, browsing people. Stops. Backtracks. He stands in front of Aurora, looking in through the glass. He glances at her data screen again."
jim,Did you know ninety percent of the businesses in the world are owned by just eight companies?
arthur,Is that right?
jim,"She's good. She knows her stuff, and she's not afraid of anybody."
arthur,Who's that?
jim,Aurora.
arthur,Who's Aurora?
jim,A woman. A passenger.
corridor,"Jim emerges from his room in boxer shorts and slippers. He's dragging a blanket. A housekeeping robot, its dustpan quivering in anticipation, hovers outside his door. Jim taps the ""Do Not Disturb"" button on his door panel and walks away. The housekeeping robot squeals in frustration as the door closes over the mess inside. "
cafeteria,Jim pours milk over a bowl of cereal.
elevator,"Jim descends, the blanket draped over his shoulders like a serape. He holds his bowl of cereal in both hands."
jim,"Arthur. Say you were trapped on a desert island, and you had the power to wish somebody there with you. You wouldn't be alone anymore, but you'd be stranding another person on the island. Would you make the wish?"
arthur,I don't know. I've never been on an island.
jim,"Okay. Say you figured out how to do something that would make your life a hundred times better. But it's wrong, and there's no taking it back. How wrong would it have to be to stop you? I mean, what if it made your life a thousand times better? How do you do the math?"
arthur,Jim. These are not robot questions. Jim stares at Arthur in frustration.
jim, I know how to wake up Aurora.
arthur,Sounds like a fine idea. You could use some company.
jim,I'd be stranding her on this ship for the rest of her life!
arthur,"Oh. Well, you can't do that. Jim buries his face in his hands."
jim,What am I going to do?
arthur,Jim. I'm here for you.
corridor,"Jim exits his cabin in his coveralls, carrying his toolbox. He finds a squadron of housekeeping robots waiting outside. He taps the ""PLEASE SERVICE"" button beside his door. The robots zoom inside with squeals of joy."
aurora's pod,"Aurora's perfect lips part. She takes a shallow breath - and then a deep one. Her chest rises and falls. Her thighs shift as she bends her knees. The sensors on her body drop off and withdraw into the pod. She opens her eyes. They're beautiful. Her pod's backrest flexes, scooping up her knees as it becomes a seat. A video screen drops in front of her. "
video stewardess,"Good morning, Aurora!"
berlin suite,"The luxury cabin now tidy and immaculate. Jim bursts in, wild-eyed. Drops his toolbox. Hides the marked- up manual in the closet. He splashes water on his face. Stares into the mirror."
video stewardess,"You're ready to go to your cabin. Make yourself at home! Enjoy the rest of your flight, Aurora! Woozy, Aurora sees the other passengers still asleep."
aurora,Wait! Why are all these people still hibernating? The screen pivots to face her. The Video Stewardess points.
video stewardess,"Aurora, your cabin is this way!"
aurora's cabin,"Posher than Jim's original cabin. A king-sized bed, a panoramic window. A widescreen video screen lights up. The Homestead Company theme music plays."
announcer,"Welcome to your cabin, Aurora! Your home until we... Aurora slaps the display off. Goes to the phone. A touch of her finger brings up the ship's telephone directory. Aurora selects ""Information."""
phone,"No one is available at that number. She touches other phone links, faster and faster."
aurora,What the hell's going on?
aurora,Passenger or crew?
jim,Passenger. Jim Preston. He sticks out a hand. She shakes it firmly. Electric for Jim. First contact.
aurora,"I'm Aurora. Jim's lips move as she speaks her name, almost saying it with her. Aurora. She doesn't pick up on it."
jim,"Yeah, I...same for me."
aurora,The crew's supposed to wake up a month before we do. But I haven't seen anybody. Jim swallows hard.
jim,The crew's still sleeping. They've got a special facility. I can see them in there but I can't get in. Aurora stares at him.
aurora,You're saying nobody's awake?
jim,Just me.
aurora,Just you?  JIM Just us.  AURORA But somebody's got to land the ship in a few weeks. Jim's finding it unexpectedly hard to deliver the bad news.  JIM I have to show you something.
observatory,"Aurora's eyes, wide and staring. Her face a mask of horror. In front of them hangs the starship's progress indicator - the Excelsior hanging between Earth and Homestead II. Thirty- one years elapsed; Eighty-nine years to go.  AURORA  Eighty-nine years to go. "
jim,The other passengers aren't late waking up. We're early. Aurora stares at Jim.
aurora,We've got to get back to sleep.
hibernation bay,Jim and Aurora walk down a row of hibernation pods.
aurora,Nobody strands me on a spaceship for a hundred years. I work for the New Yorker. I'll write an expose so hot you'll need oven mitts to read it. Trust me.
jim,It's not that simple. Putting somebody into hibernation takes special equipment. Remember the facility where they put us to sleep? Jim points at a pod beside them. A middle-aged woman inside.
jim,Not that I can see.
aurora,There has to be. There's always a way. Where's the crew?
aurora," How long have you been awake, Jim?"
jim,A year and three months. Aurora covers her mouth. Her eyes full of horror.
aurora,"Oh, my God. No. She turns her back. Suddenly she walks briskly away. And breaks into a run. Jim watches her go, astonished. After a moment he runs after her."
hibernation bay,"Aurora runs down a row of hibernation pods, her eyes searching wildly among the glass tubes. She turns a corner. Hesitates. Runs down another row. She's fighting tears. She puts on speed. Her sash unknots itself and her robe billows behind her."
jim,"Aurora! He turns another corner and sees her. She's sitting down, her back against a hibernation pod. Laughing at her own tears."
aurora,"I can't even find the one I'm supposed to be in. Jim extends a hand. She lets him pull her to her feet. He gives her the sash, and she ties her robe around her."
jim,I shouldn't have told you like that.
aurora,"No, I'm sorry. It just hit me how serious this is. How did you wake up?"
jim,"I just did. I woke up, my pod dumped me out, and there I was."
aurora,Me too. We have to get help.
jim,"I've sent...sixteen messages to Earth. A bunch to the Homestead company, one to the Space Administration, one to the United Nations. A couple to Homestead II, just for the hell of it. My phone bill's about eighty grand."
aurora,How soon could we hear something?
jim,"With speed-of-light lag, fifty-six years. That'll be from Earth. Nothing from Homestead II until we're almost there anyway. Eighty years or so. Aurora's mouth goes dry. She swallows hard."
aurora,What about the other planets?
jim,The other occupied worlds are even farther away. We'd die of old age before they could answer.
aurora,What about other ships?  Jim?
jim, I never thought of other ships.
aurora,"Jim, you've had more than a year! There has to be a flight plan or something... They search the Comm Center and find a map table showing the Excelsior's position relative to the Occupied Worlds. Aurora fiddles with the controls. Interstellar flight plans appear: a spiderweb of starship tracks between the worlds."
jim,The computer knows. Give me a ship.
aurora, The starship Zephyr.
jim,Round-trip message lag...ninety-nine years.
aurora,The starship Andromeda.
jim,One hundred thirty-two years.
aurora,The Maximilian.
jim,Eighty-one years. Jim and Aurora deflate visibly.
aurora,That's the closest one.
aurora,"I know I should be working the problem right now, but I can barely keep my eyes open."
jim,You just came out of hibernation. It'll be a couple days before you're a hundred percent. You should rest.
jim,I'll walk you to your cabin.
aurora,"No, I'm all right."
jim,Okay.
aurora,"Jim. Don't look so down. It's going to be okay. You've got me on the team now. Chin up, all right? Jim nods, speechless."
jim,I'm in the Berlin Suite if you need me. She stops. Turns to look back at him.
aurora,A year and a half? Must have been hard.
jim,It was.
aurora,"Good night, Jim."
jim,Whiskey. Rocks.
arthur,Sure thing. How's your day been? Jim takes a stiff drink.
jim,Aurora's awake.
arthur,Congratulations.  You don't look happy.
jim,Arthur. Can you keep a secret?
arthur,I'm a bartender.
jim,Don't tell Aurora I woke her up. She thinks it was an accident. Let me tell her. Okay?
aurora,How can there be no way to put someone into hibernation aboard ship? What if a pod breaks down?
infomat,No pod has malfunctioned in thousands of interstellar flights.
aurora,"Well, I'm awake."
infomat,Hibernation pods are fail-safe. Jim appears behind Aurora.  JIM Good morning. Have you eaten?  AURORA I'm starving. This is the dumbest machine.
cafeteria,"Jim watches in astonishment as Aurora blithely orders the snacks that the machines deny him. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme. The French Breakfast Puff. The Gourmet Fruit Salad. They sit. Aurora eyes Jim's tray.  AURORA You're a man of simple tastes.  JIM I'm a silver class passenger. The French Breakfast Puff is above my pay grade.  AURORA Oh, no! All this time? What can I get you?  JIM No, I'm fine, really...  AURORA Shut up. I'll be right back. She gets up. In a minute she's back, setting a tray down in front of Jim: A western omelette with a side of bacon...a cafe latte...half a honeydew melon. Jim shoves his old breakfast aside.  JIM Thank you. They dig in.  AURORA You think the crew members would know what to do?  JIM I was hoping so. "
aurora,Could we wake them up if we got in there?
aurora,Maybe there's another way to go to sleep. Did you check out the infirmary?
jim,"I looked around. It's the usual hospital stuff. Scanners, autodocs."
aurora,Did you look for ways of going to sleep?
jim,Not really.
aurora,"Well, Jim!"
jim,You think they've got suspended animation pills sitting around?
aurora,You don't know until you look. What about cargo? Maybe there's a hibernation machine in the hold.
jim,"I looked at the manifests. It's mostly farming stuff, industrial machines. We're not going to find a hibernation facility in a box."
aurora,You don't know that! We have to think big here. Maybe we can build our own hibernation machine.
jim,"No, we can't."
aurora,You're not even trying!
jim,I've been awake a year and a half. I've tried everything I can think of.
aurora," Well, it looks to me like you missed some possibilities. And I'm not ready to give up. She strides out. Jim watches her go. Reaches over and takes the Gourmet Fruit Salad off her tray."
workstation,No plans are available.
aurora,"What about research articles, any kind of technical documents?"
workstation,Hibernation technology is proprietary. The following articles deal with the subject on a theoretical level.
communications booth,"Planet and connection, please."
aurora,"Earth. The New Yorker magazine, office of the Editor in Chief."
communications booth,Begin message.
aurora,There's no way we're going to build a hibernation machine.
jim,No.
aurora,And there's no magic sleeping drugs in the infirmary.
jim,No.
aurora,"I did find the gene bank. Five thousand sperm and egg samples on ice. I should be glad they do that. By the time we get to Homestead II, that little capsule in the freezer is going to be all that's left of me. We really are screwed, aren't we?"
jim,Pretty much.
aurora,"So who are you, Jim? I'm going to be seeing you around. I should know who I'm talking to."
jim,I'm from Denver. Lived there all my life.
aurora,What kind of work do you do?
jim,"A little of everything. Transport, robotics, industrial systems. I fix what's broken. On the emigration forms I'm a ""rate two"" mechanical engineer. Means I don't have a Ph.D."
aurora,"Neither do I. But a journalist doesn't need one; she just needs a way with words and an attitude. I'm from Manhattan, so I had the attitude."
jim,I noticed.
aurora,And the words have always been there when I needed them.
jim,Not all of them.
arthur,"Evening, Jim. Who's the lovely lady?"
jim,"Arthur, this is Aurora. Aurora, Arthur.  ARTHUR Aurora. A pleasure. He takes her hand formally.  AURORA Arthur! Lovely to meet you. She peeks over the bar at Arthur's mechanical mounting, the rails he rolls on.  ARTHUR What'll it be?  AURORA Dirty martini!   Whiskey and soda."
later,"Empty glasses show that Jim and Aurora have been doing yeoman's work at the bar. Both are tipsy and laughing.  AURORA   My God, I almost forgot my life is in ruins. That wipes the smile off Jim's face.  JIM Sorry.  AURORA What for? It's time to sleep. In the morning we'll think of something brilliant.  JIM All right.  AURORA Good night, Jim. Good night, Arthur. She exits. "
arthur,Good night.  She's wonderful. Excellent choice. Jim drops his head into his hands.
aurora,Jim! Wake up! The door opens. Jim stands blinking in his bathrobe.
jim,"What? She pulls him down the hall, chattering."
aurora,It takes too long to get to Homestead II. But we're still closer to Earth. We'll turn the ship around.
elevator,Aurora drags Jim in and punches the button.
aurora,We'll go home.
jim,It would take decades.
aurora,It's our only chance of getting off this ship in our lifetimes.
command deck,Aurora drags Jim out of the elevator. Looks around.
aurora,Where's the...navigating place?
jim,That way. But... She drags him toward the Bridge.
aurora,We can learn how to pilot the ship. We have all the time in the world.
jim,There's just one problem.
jim,"Everything important - the reactor, the gravity drive - it's all behind firewalls. There's no way through."
aurora,Oh.
jim,Sorry.
aurora,New file. My Voyage.
grand concourse,"Jim sits at a table, a technical manual open in front of him. He looks up. Watches Aurora jog around the atrium and vanish.  AURORA  I'm not alone. Another passenger shares my fate. A mechanic named Jim Preston."
aurora,"Vanished, like a dream, in the blink of an eye. She falters, frightened by her own words."
aurora,Why did you do it? Jim is thunderstruck. The game is up. He swallows hard.
jim,Do what?
aurora,Emigrate. Leave Earth. I'm interviewing you.
jim,You're what?
aurora,Interviewing you. You're the first victim of hibernation failure in the history of space travel. That makes you news.
jim,Who are you going to tell?
aurora,Posterity. So why'd you give up your life on Earth? Jim seems stunned by the question. He hadn't thought about it in quite those words.
jim,"I, uh...I never really..."
aurora,Were you running away from something?
jim,No. Things were okay.
aurora,So?
jim,"I just wanted more, I guess. You know. More room. A fresh start. Back to basics."
jim,I guess.
aurora,Jim!
jim,"I'm a mechanic. A rate-two mechanic. We're a dying breed on Earth. But in the colonies, they still have problems to solve. My kind of problems. In the colonies, a handyman is somebody. Nothing there for Aurora to scoff at. She looks impressed."
aurora,Now you're back to advertising.
jim,Can't it still be true?
hibernation bay,Jim and Aurora walk down an aisle of hibernation pods.
aurora,"You know how much the Homestead Company's made off its first planet, Homestead I? Over eight quadrillion dollars. That's eight million billions. Colony planets are the biggest business there is. Did you pay full price for your ticket?"
jim,"No, I'm in a desirable trade."
jim,All you see here is five thousand suckers?
aurora,I see zeroes on the HomeStead Company's bottom line.
jim,I see five thousand men and women changing their lives. For five thousand different reasons. You don't know these people. Jim walks up to a hibernation pod. Glances at the data screen. He covers the screen with his hand.
aurora,Banker.
jim,"Gardener. Jim moves down the row, peeks at another screen, covers it."
aurora,She's too silly to be a Donna. I think she's a Lola.
jim,"Madison. Chef, accountant, or midwife?"
aurora,She has to be a midwife. There's no way you made that one up.
jim," She's a midwife. I didn't know they still had midwives. They move among the sleepers, quizzing each other."
aurora," Married, or strangers?"
jim,Married.
jim," Sixteen, twenty-six, or thirty-six?"
aurora,I'd almost say sixteen...twenty-six.
jim,Right.
aurora," Politician, historian, or artist?"
jim,I don't know. Artist?
aurora,It doesn't say. But I'll tell you this: I like her. We'd be friends. Jim looks at Aurora seriously.
jim,You think you can see that?
aurora,Don't you? Jim looks at the woman in the pod. Smiles.
jim,Yeah.
aurora,That was my plan. Travel to Homestead II. Live there for a year and see what emigrating's really like. Then back to Earth. I'm the only passenger on board with a round-trip ticket.
aurora,"No! I end up in the future. Two hundred and fifty years in the future. On Earth, which is still the center of civilization, overcrowded or not. And I arrive in the future with an amazing story."
jim,And what's this amazing story?
aurora,The selling of the colonial dream.
jim,Big plans.
aurora,"My friends threw me this huge farewell party. Everyone came. It was the happiest, saddest night. And look what it's all come to."
jim,Watch your step. I've made a few changes. Next to Jim's favorite seat there's a cluster of machines with power cables and hoses running to them. Jim and Aurora sit. A screen beside Jim lists movies.
jim,What are you so happy about?
aurora,I'm up two points! She cuts around him toward the basket.
aurora,"The starship's designers gave the ship a daily rhythm. The light is warm in the morning, bright during the day, cool at night. We need those changes. But I miss other rhythms. There are no holidays here. Every day is a day of leisure. There are no seasons. The sky never changes. A mechanical whir distracts her. She looks down. Jim's pet robot looks up at her with binocular eyes. It carries a note in a clip on its back. Aurora pulls it free. A handwritten invitation from Jim. It reads:"
- jim,Aurora reads the note with a grin. 
jim,Wow.
aurora,You clean up all right yourself. You went shopping.
jim,I went shoplifting. In the corridor stands a cargo robot to which Jim has attached an upholstered loveseat. He helps Aurora aboard and takes a seat beside her. She's charmed.
cargo robot,"Yes, Passenger Jim! The robot zooms off to the sound of Aurora's laughter."
arthur,Evening. What can I get for you?
aurora,"A manhattan, please."
jim,"Single malt, rocks. Arthur pours."
arthur,You two look fine this evening.
arthur,Very nice.
aurora, Took you long enough to ask.
jim,I was giving you space!
aurora,Space is one thing I don't need more of. I've been doing research.
jim,Really?!
aurora,But it's not suspended animation. We'd still be aging.
jim,Oh.
aurora,"Yeah. If I have to grow old on this ship, I'd at least like to be awake for it. So that was a failure."
jim,A highly ambitious failure.
aurora,"There's the title of my memoir. ""A Highly Ambitious Failure,"" by Aurora Dunn. Jim laughs. He thinks for a minute."
jim,"""Voyage to Nowhere,"" by Jim Preston."
jim,"""A Spaceship Built For Two."""
aurora,"Incredible. They sit at the best table. Robots attend to their every need. The blue stars frame Jim's head; the pink, Aurora's. Beautiful dishes arrive: new wines with every course."
aurora,"Rutherford, stop! The robot stops. She pulls Jim off."
aurora,Thank you. I had an amazing time. A great night.
jim,"Yeah, me too. Well, good night. He turns to go."
aurora,Jim. He turns back. Aurora grabs him and drags him into her cabin.
aurora's cabin,"They stagger across the room together. He backs her up against a wall, kisses his way down her throat. She drags his jacket off his shoulders. Pulls at his shirt. He slips the straps from her shoulders. Her dress slides to the floor. They roll onto the bed."
aurora,This is so good. I'm starving.  Last night was just what I needed.
jim,"You are the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. You're so beautiful it hurts me. She stares, shocked. Leans across the table and kisses him. Soon they're making out right on top of breakfast. A passing robot pauses to observe the scene - then moves on."
berlin suite,"Jim and Aurora lie in Jim's imperial bed, glistening with sweat and breathing hard. She lays her head on his shoulder, her eyes far away and wistful."
jim,You okay?
aurora,"Yes, I'm fine. It's just..."
jim,"I know. She snuggles in tighter, and he holds her close."
jim,I'm going to finish my survey of the cargo hold. See what there is to play with.
aurora,Be careful.
jim,Back by happy hour.
aurora,The Polynesians set out into the Pacific Ocean with no destination. Searching for islands. They sailed into the endless sea on faith.
aurora,Is it movement that we need? Or the possibility of something new?
arthur,What's that?
aurora,"I'm writing, Arthur. Hush. Aurora's slate has recorded this exchange: she erases the extra words with her fingertip."
aurora,Hi.
jim,Hi. How was your day?
aurora,"I don't know. I wrote a few pages. I'm not sure what I'm doing anymore. I was writing a book, and I was keeping a diary. But the book and the diary are running together. I think I'm writing about us."
jim,Makes sense to me.
aurora,I'm not sure I want to write about this life. I don't even know how to think about it. I live in a palace. But it's also a prison. I'm moving at half the speed of light and I can't go anywhere! Jim takes that in.
jim,"The cargo hold is full of pioneer gear. There's a submarine down there, can you believe it? Ships and airplanes and bulldozers. That's what I wanted, a world still being built. But I'll never see it. They sit for a moment in glum contemplation."
aurora,Did you find anything that could help us?
jim,Yes. I found these. Jim unzips his duffel bag and takes out a bouquet of long- stemmed roses. Aurora gasps. Reaches out to touch them.
aurora,Are they real?
jim,"I cut them myself. Aurora leaps into action. She finds scissors, a pitcher. At the sink she trims the stems, arranges the flowers."
aurora,Thank you.
jim,You're welcome. She looks into his eyes.
aurora,"For very unlucky people, we got pretty lucky."
jim,It's coming! Run!
celestial promenade,"Jim and Aurora run up the stairs onto the highest promenade on the ship: glass all around, skylight above. The deep RUMBLE is louder. A bloody light fills the sky. A STAR looms ahead of the ship: a RED GIANT. The Excelsior rockets toward the star. The passage takes less than a minute. The Red Giant swells in the windows. The ship shudders. The engines howl. Aurora falls into Jim's arms. The ship bathed in red light. The star fills the skylight, fills the sky itself. A fiery surface turbulent with sunspots and mysterious currents. The engines howl. And then they're past. The star recedes, dwindling as quickly as it grew. The engines quiet. The ship's calm restored."
jim,Closest we'll get to a star on the whole trip. Happy birthday.
arthur,Birthday cocktail for the birthday girl.
aurora,Aren't you going to check my I.D.? I might not be old enough to drink.
arthur,I'd never ask your age in front of a gentleman.
aurora,Jim's not a gentleman. Anyway there's no secrets between me and Jim.
arthur, Is that so?
jim,You heard the lady. Be right back. He walks away.
aurora,"You know what I like about you, Arthur? You have a sense of occasion. I bet ladies fall for you on every trip."
arthur,"I'd say you were pulling my leg, but I haven't got any."
arthur,"I remember your last birthday, a year ago. Jim was really looking forward to meeting you. Aurora frowns, processing this sentence - her smile fading."
aurora,What?
men's washroom,"Jim stands at the mirror, straightening his lapels, touching up his hair. He unwraps the ring. Looks it over. Smiles at his reflection."
concourse bar,"Aurora scowls at Arthur, trying to get her bearings."
aurora,"What do you mean, he was looking forward to it? How could he..."
arthur,"He couldn't stop talking about you, let me tell you. He spent months deciding whether to wake you up. Aurora eyes widen in shock."
aurora,Jim woke me up.
arthur,"Oh, yes. Said it was the hardest decision of his life, but I see it worked out just fine. Aurora stops breathing. She stares at the bartop. Jim strolls up to the bar. His hand slides into the jacket pocket where the ring lies hidden. But Aurora's body language is all wrong. He stops, perplexed."
jim,"What? She looks up, her face rigid. Her voice a whisper."
aurora,"Did you wake me up, Jim? Jim's hand slides out of his jacket pocket. He shoots a look at Arthur, who smiles back, oblivious. Aurora's eyes bore into him. Finally Jim finds his voice."
jim,Yes. I woke you up.
jim,I tried not to.
aurora,You pulled me out of hibernation. You destroyed the rest of my life. You murdered me!
jim,That's a little strong...
aurora,"You murdered me. I'm going to be sick. Oh, my God. I...I can't see. She gets up to leave."
jim,Aurora. He goes after her.
aurora,"Get away from me! She slaps at him blindly, almost hysterical. Stumbles away."
jim,It wasn't like that.
aurora,"What was it like? And you had it all planned out! Dinner and movies and our big date...Oh, my God! And I just ate it up. Fake! All fake!"
jim,This was real. I didn't plan this. It...happened.
jim,Aurora. I love you.
aurora,This is sick.  Show me how you did it.
aurora,So?
jim,"I looked at my pod. A couple different processors burned out at the same time. I triggered the same failure in your pod. Short circuit across these two contacts, and then these two. And cut these wires."
aurora,Just like that.
jim,Just like that.
aurora,"I'm so stupid. I fell for all of it. I fell for you. I thought you saved me. But you didn't save me, Jim. You did this to me. And now I'm stuck with you. Stuck with the second-rate mechanic who ruined my life."
jim,Can I talk to you?
aurora,"I don't want to talk anymore. I don't want to look at you anymore. If you see me coming, get out of my way. If you see me sitting, find somewhere else to be. There's plenty of choices. It's a big boat."
swimming pool,Aurora swims. Reaches the end of a lap and rests. She looks up abruptly as if she senses someone watching her - but the balcony above the pool is deserted.
robot's pov,Aurora looms close. She holds the note up to the robot's eyes and crumples it up.
aurora,"Watching me through a robot is creepy, Jim. Cut it out."
elite deck,"Aurora circles the atrium. OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM: Jim clears his throat.  JIM  Please, just hear me. Aurora rolls her eyes and resumes running."
aurora,"That's great, Jim. Just great. I'm glad that ruining my life somehow improved yours. But I have a run to finish, so..."
aurora,It's the modern way of life. We surround ourselves with people. A constant din of conversation. As if we need the mirror of other faces to see ourselves. The clamor of voices in our ears to reassure us that we exist. Do we need it? Can we live without it?
aurora,What are you doing here?
arthur,"Actually, today's Wednesday."
jim,I slept through Tuesday?
aurora,Forget it. The bar's all yours. But I'd say a drink is the last thing you need. You're pathetic. Aurora leaves. Jim takes a seat.
arthur,What'll it be?
jim,I'm going to kill myself.
arthur,Why's that?
jim,I'm a murderer.
arthur,Who'd you murder?
jim,Aurora.
arthur,But she's alive. She was just here.
jim,"She won't talk to me. She won't let me tell her what happened. How I fell in love with her. How I want to be with her. And I'm not sorry I woke her up. I'm not. I love her. And you know what? She loves me. Around the corner, out of sight, Aurora stands listening."
arthur,I think you've had enough. Jim looks at Arthur as if he's said something profound.
jim,You know what? You're right. I've had enough.
aurora,"I haven't written in days. I don't know why. It's the old problem, I guess. Who's my reader? Who am I talking to? What's it for?"
autodoc,"Two separated ribs. Fracture of the right arm, radius and ulna. One fractured finger. Dislocated thumb."
jim,"Am I gonna be okay? Blindingly fast, robot arms straighten Jim's elbow. Wrap his ribs and arm with smooth white bandages. Jim shouts in shock."
autodoc,"Leave the bandages on for one week. The autodoc opens and Jim climbs out, testing his arm. A bottle of pills rattles into a tray in front of him."
jim,"Thanks, doc."
autodoc,And take better care of yourself.
grand concourse,"Jim kneels on the Grand Concourse. He's torn a huge hole in the carpet to expose the deck plates beneath. With his laser cutter he cuts a large rectangular hole. Pries the plate up with a crowbar, opening a cavity in the deck."
aurora's cabin,"Aurora paces in her bathrobe, hair wrapped in a towel. She looks at her gallery of snapshots. Touches the pictures one by one. The faces begin to move and speak. A cacophony of good wishes. Laughter and cheers. Finally only one clip still plays. Aurora's mother."
aurora's mother,"I promise you we'll think of you every day. When you wake up, I know we'll be gone...but you just know that we lived our lives remembering you, and holding you in our hearts.  I hope you find what you're looking for. I hope it makes you happy. Aurora watches, devastated."
arthur,"Hello, Jim. Whiskey?"
jim,Iced tea.
arthur,Coming up. Are you getting my barstool dirty?
jim,"Got to get dirty to get things done, Arthur. If your hands are too clean, it means you're not making anything."
arthur,And what are you making?
jim,Improvements.
grand concourse,Aurora walks wonderingly up to a GARDEN on the Concourse: a ten-foot OAK TREE surrounded by flowerbeds and green grass.
aurora,I need you. The last thing Jim expected to hear.
jim,Wow. You do need a repairman.
jim,The control unit burned out. I took the one from the cabin next door. He throws a switch. The lights come on. Back to normal.
aurora,"I'm fine, Jim. Thanks for your work."
grand concourse,Jim passes a cleaning robot stuck in a corner. He frees the robot: it plows right back into the corner. Another robot zooms in - and gets stuck beside the first one. Jim studies the robots thoughtfully.
grand concourse,"GUS MANCUSO stands at a deck steward's station, intercom mic in hand. A stocky man of 55, with a bristling mustache, wearing a crewman's coverall. Haggard and weary. He stares in consternation at the garden in the middle of the Concourse. Running footsteps. Jim and Aurora race into the Concourse from opposite directions. They see Gus and stop, astonished.  GUS  How long have you been awake?  AURORA A year.  JIM Two years.  GUS This is not good."
cafeteria,"Jim, Aurora, and Gus sit around a table. Gus leans heavily on his elbows, sipping from a mug. "
gus,I always get a hibernation hangover but this is the worst ever.
jim,Yeah.
gus,"Two years. Ouch.  You know what it means, right? There's no way back into hibernation."
aurora,I was hoping you'd know something we didn't.
gus,No. We're awake for the duration. How far along are we? You know?
jim,Thirty-two years. Eighty-eight years to go. Gus blows air.
gus,That's tough.  Hibernation failure! They said it couldn't happen. And now three on one trip. Aurora shoots Jim a look. Gus doesn't notice.
command deck,Gus leads Jim and Aurora to the Bridge's armored hatch. He swipes his crew card and the door opens.
jim,You have no idea how long I've been trying to get in here.
gus,Now you're in. Don't touch anything.
bridge,"The computer consoles of the Bridge brighten as they enter. Gus walks from station to station, studying the screens."
gus,"We're on course....Whatever's wrong with the ship, NavComp's still minding the store."
jim,What do you think is wrong?
gus,Three pod failures? Something's wrong. Question is what. He turns to leave.
aurora,Wait. What about diverting the ship? Can we go back to Earth? Gus almost laughs.
gus,"We're going forty percent of lightspeed away from Earth. To go home we'd have to come to a stop, accelerate back towards Earth, and then come to a stop again. It'd take as long as going on to Homestead II. Anyway, navigation's not for amateurs. Space is a big place, and a planet's just a little thing. Gus has a coughing fit. Wipes his mouth with his fist."
diagnostic center,"Gus opens a secure compartment beside the bridge. Inside, the Diagnostic Computer stands dark and dead."
gus,I thought we'd see a lot of red lights here. That would mean trouble.
aurora,So everything's okay?
gus,"No, if everything was okay we'd see a lot of green lights here."
aurora,What does no lights mean?
gus,No lights means big trouble. Diagnostic Computer's down. We've got some work to do.
jim,What do you need?
gus,Right now? Cheeseburger.
gus, Never been so hungry. Worst hibernation hangover ever. Jim can't take his eyes off Gus. A new person.
jim,"So where you from, Gus?"
gus,"Grew up in Chicago. But I've lived on this ship a long time. The Excelsior's made five inter-planetary runs, and I've been on every one. I live aboard. When she makes port, I live where she lands until she lifts again."
jim, How old does that make you?
gus,Fifty-six.
jim,But how long ago were you born?
gus,Oh. Hang on...  About six hundred years ago.
aurora,You should rest.
gus,"I think I will.  Tomorrow morning, eight bells, you meet me beside that tree of yours. Until I figure out what's wrong with the Excelsior, you work for me. Jim and Aurora smile."
jim,"Yes, sir."
aurora,"Good night, Gus. Gus waves and walks off. That leaves Jim and Aurora sitting awkwardly on the same side of a diner booth. After a moment Aurora moves over to the other side. Looks at Jim across the table."
jim,"I've missed you. Aurora stares, caught off guard. She gets up."
aurora,See you in the morning.
gus,"The CPU's burned out, can you believe it? Why should that happen? It's rated for five hundred years."
aurora,Can you fix it?
gus,"You don't fix it, you replace it. There are spares for everything in storage. Make a note. Diagnostic Computer CPU. And a new cooling fan, this one looks shot."
aurora,Got it.
grand concourse,Gus and Aurora stand waiting as if for a bus.
aurora,Don't take this the wrong way - I wish for your sake you were still asleep - but I'm glad you're here.
gus,"Thank you, sweetheart. A GROWL of gears. Jim drives up in his souped-up golf cart."
jim,"The golf cart. Gus takes in the bank of batteries, the giant tractor wheels."
gus,This I like.
gus,Next bay is the ship's stores. So how fast can she go? Jim puts the pedal down. The cart lays rubber on the deck plates and shoots down the aisle while Aurora and Gus yell.
ship's stores,"Up on a hydraulic lift, Gus digs components out of storage. Hands them to Aurora, who hands them to Jim, who loads them into the cart. "
diagnostic center,"Gus works on the Diagnostic Computer while Jim looks on. Nearby, Aurora thumbs through Gus's technical manuals. Gus clamps a final component in place and nods at Jim."
gus,Start `er up. Jim closes a circuit breaker and powers up the computer. A deep electrical HUM as the machine boots up. The screen flashes a message: RUNNING VESSEL DIAGNOSTIC. A progress bar shows that the diagnostic is 0.0% complete. The lights on the indicator panel remain dark. The first light begins to flicker as the diagnostic runs.
jim,How long will it take?
gus,Full diagnostic from a cold start? Days. But it'll tell us everything.
grand concourse,"Gus strolls through the ship, looking around nostalgically. He passes Jim's garden and shakes his head."
concourse bar,Gus walks up to the bar.
arthur,Chief Mancuso! Good to see you.
gus,"Good to see you too, Arthur."
arthur,What can I get you?
gus,Just an ice water with a little lemon. I feel hot as hell. Gus mops sweat from his brow and sips his water. His hand trembles hard enough to rattle the ice cubes.
gus's cabin,"A homey space, filled with Gus's possessions: pictures of fellow spacers and vacation spots on half a dozen planets. Books, keepsakes and mementos. Gus sits on his bed, on a handmade quilt. Coughs violently into a handkerchief, leaving the cloth spotted with blood."
aurora,"Thank you. Gus arrives in a fresh coverall, a steaming mug in hand. No signs of frailty. He hands each of them a digital slate."
gus,All right. Last night I checked ten atmosphere stations and two of them were burned out. Twenty percent failure rate. Unheard of. So we're going to see how far the rot runs.
aurora,"Yes, sir."
jim,Got it.
gus,I'm going down to the Hibernation Bay to look at our pods. Maybe I can spot what went wrong. Jim and Aurora exchange glances.
aurora,That should be interesting.
gus,Son of a gun. A sound behind him. Gus turns to find Jim watching. He looks from Jim to the pod mechanism and back again.
jim,I finished.
gus," I looked at your pod. Very simple. The clock chips burned out. Not supposed to happen, but it's simple. Jim fidgets. Starts to speak. Gus cuts him off."
jim,Gus...
gus,You did this.
jim,Yeah.
gus,"I was thinking what a lucky son of a bitch you were, stuck with a beauty like Aurora. But it wasn't luck."
jim,"No. Gus sits down heavily, looking at Jim."
gus,She knows?
jim,"She knows. Gus thinks that over, shaking his head at the idea."
gus,I could see there was some trouble between you. Gus starts putting his tools away. Jim lays the electronic slate down beside him.
jim,Here's your inventory. I'll be in the machine shop if you need me.
aurora,I finished the census.
gus,Yeah.
aurora,So you know. What Jim did. Aurora's chin begins to tremble.
gus,"Yeah, he told me."
aurora,"He told you? Just like that? And? She waits, trembling with righteous indignation. Gus doesn't want to get into this: he looks away uncomfortably."
gus,"No, it's a bad thing. But...  Look. When a drowning man drags somebody down with him, you don't call it right. But he's drowning. A starving man steals a loaf of bread, what can you say? You should have starved?"
aurora,I would have starved.
gus,"Really? Aurora looks hard at Gus, thinking, and says nothing."
gus,"By Aurora's count, about thirty percent of the atmosphere station CPUs are burned out."
jim,We can replace them.
gus,We will. But they'll just burn out again if we don't figure out why it's happening.
jim,Where do we start?
gus,We wait for the diagnostic report. You've been knocking around this ship for two years. A few days more won't kill you. Gus hacks and coughs. For a moment his weakness is plain to see...but robots sweep in and lay dishes on the table. Gus sets his slate aside.
aurora,So how did you end up in space?
gus,"Only place I ever wanted to be. When I was sixteen I lied about my age and got onto a lunar shuttle crew. A few years later I moved on to planetary ships. Made the Venus run a hundred times, then Jupiter and Saturn. Then the gravity drive came along. Real spaceflight. I did everything I could to get onto an interstellar ship. I was thirty-six years old the first time I saw an alien sun. No going back after that. I've walked on seventeen planets in five solar systems."
jim,That's incredible.
aurora,Don't you feel homeless?
gus,"I'm a spacer. My home is where I am. You can't take much with you, so you don't get hung up on things. You have yourself. The things you do. The company you keep. Gus pushes himself off his stool. Momentarily shaky, he pulls himself together. He takes a seat at the grand piano and plays - a fine beerhall pianist. Gus touches a switch and lifts his hands: the piano keeps playing. Gus stands and extends a hand to Aurora. She takes it, and Gus sweeps her across the floor. Jim watches from the bar."
arthur, Gus always dances with the ladies.
gus's cabin,"Gus lies feverish and semi-conscious in his bed. A THUNK! The door slides open. Jim and Aurora rush in.  JIM Gus! Are you all right?  GUS No. No, I'm not."
infirmary,"Gus lies in a medical scanner. Jim and Aurora watch as the machine bathes Gus in light, sensors floating over his body.  GUS Couldn't get up. Weak as a baby. What does it say is wrong with me? The scanner's display screen lists not one diagnosis, but hundreds: disorders, diseases, dysfunctions.  JIM  It's a few things.  MEDICAL SCANNER Diagnosis complete. Gus hauls himself out of the scanner. Pulls a bathrobe on and comes around to look at the screen. He sees it and blanches. "
gus,What's the summary?
medical scanner,Pan-systemic necrosis. Progressive organ failure. Cause unknown.
gus, I'll tell you the cause. My goofy hibernation pod is the cause.
aurora,What's the treatment?
medical scanner,No treatment known. Gus pivots the monitor so that only he can see it.
gus,"Prognosis. A series of images flickers over the screen, casting shadows on his face. Gus swallows hard and looks away."
medical scanner,Between two and three days. A long moment of silence. Gus turns and exits.
corridor,Gus settles himself behind the wheel of Jim's cart.
jim,Gus!
gus,"Sorry, Jim. Gus puts his foot down and the cart squeals away."
jim,"He's not in his room. Aurora flips on the intercom, speaks into the mic. Her voice resonates through the ship."
aurora,"Where are you? Gus, please answer. We'll be at the Concourse Bar every hour. I'm really worried."
jim,Where is he? What's he doing?
aurora,Where have you been?
gus,Making arrangements. You kids have dinner plans?
jim,No.
gus,Xanadu at eight.
aurora,You look magnificent.
jim,How you feeling?
gus,"Fine, fine."
aurora,"Gus, just because some stupid machine says there's no cure..."
gus,"State-of-the-art machine, Aurora. Anyway, I can feel it happening."
aurora,But you just got here. It's barely been a week. He takes her hand.
gus,No point counting the days.
gus,"A pure oxygen environment is about as dangerous a place as you can be. A steel pipe will burn in pure O2. And there I am with a hammer, trying to close this valve and stop the oxygen flow, when one spark will kill us all. But the thing is, O2 makes you punchy. So I can't stop laughing. And then the guys behind me start in, and soon everybody's going. Captain's giggling like a girl. The Navigator pissed his pants laughing. Jim and Aurora laugh. But pain contorts Gus's face. He grips the table with white knuckles. And nobody's laughing anymore."
gus,I went through the ship's manuals and made notes wherever there was something special you should know. These should keep you straight. In a few days the Diagnostic Computer will show you what needs fixing. He takes his shipcard from around his neck. Hands it to Jim.
jim,Why are we standing by the airlock?
aurora,"Oh, God! Gus, no!"
gus,"Got no choice about going. But I can decide how to go, and I'm going out on my own two feet."
gus,"If you knew how this feels, Jimbo, you wouldn't ask me to stay. Gus extends a hand to Aurora. She throws her arms around him."
aurora,Gus. I can't stand it. There's got to be some other way. Don't do this. Gus gently frees himself from her arms.
jim,"Yes, sir."
gus,"And take care of each other. Gus turns and opens the airlock. He straightens, squares his shoulders, and steps inside. Turns to face them."
robotics center,Jim walks in.   Everywhere robots bunch and stumble. A pair of sweeper robots fight to enter the same recharging niche. They trip up a procession of gangly window washers - who stumble into a parade of robot waiters. Chaos spreads. The robots' clockwork perfection upset.
cafeteria,Aurora draws a glass of orange juice and gets green sludge. Dials for toast and gets two slices of charcoal.
aurora,"There's trouble everywhere. Atmosphere systems, water systems, waste systems, robot control."
jim, What's happening? Aurora goes to the worktable: its surface displays the diagnostic report. Thousands of faults and failures.
aurora,"It started two years ago. Thirty years with no trouble, then forty- seven failures in a single day.  Structural concussion. System overvoltage. Transient pressure anomaly. Circuit reset, conduit 12."
jim,Pod 1498? That's me!
aurora,Whatever happened that day woke you up. She pulls up a graph of failures over time: A trickle of breakdowns that swells into a torrent.
jim,"Ever since then, more and more failures. Faster and faster."
aurora,How do we find out what's going on?
jim,We start at the beginning. The breakdowns from the day I woke up. Aurora brings up a map of the ship on the display. Red markers blink on the map.
aurora,They're all on Deck One.
jim,Power Converter seems okay.
aurora,The failures are all below us.
aurora,It's beautiful.
jim,Scares the hell out of me.
aurora,What keeps it in?
jim,"Gravity. The gravity plant gives us weight. Propels the ship. And it contains the fusion reaction. All one system. Aurora watches Jim as he walks among the consoles, studying the instruments."
aurora,The cluster of failures is still one level down.
aurora,This should be it. Jim cards the door with Gus's shipcard. The lock flashes a red light and stays closed.
jim,Gus's card should open any door.
aurora, Let me try an override code. She squeezes past Jim. Taps at the door's keypad. Jim peers through the narrow window in the door.
jim,"Wait a sec, maybe there's a reason the door... The light flashes green. The door begins to slide open. A HOWLING WIND sucks Aurora against the crack in the door. She screams. Jim grabs at her. A hurricane drags her inside."
aurora,Jim. Are you okay?
jim,I think I'm all right.  Look. In the center of the room a round column houses the CORE COMPUTER. There's a CRATER blasted in the machine.
jim,A meteor.
aurora,"A rock. They stare at the meteor: the cause of it all. A BEEP: on the Diagnostic Computer's console, more green lights turn red. New errors pop up on the diagnostic report."
aurora,And every computer that burns out increases the load on the others.
jim,"Yeah. The breakdown accelerates. If we don't stop it, the whole ship will go down."
aurora,I'm trapped on a sinking ship?
jim,"Gus said there's spares for everything. If we replace the core computer, it'll pick up the load. The burnouts will stop. Another BEEP. Another green light turns red."
aurora,Let's go.
aurora,"Two more rows, then left! The cart squeals around a corner."
aurora,"First you connect the data bus, then the sync cable, then bridge the power and backup power...you're supposed to run a startup checklist, but Gus made a note. He says you can skip straight to power-up as long as you..."
aurora,You just got sucked into outer space. Take a break.
jim,Aurora!
jim,What are you doing?
jim,We've got to get you down. The gravity might come back on. Aurora hadn't thought of that. She looks down fearfully. Jim swings over the railing. Braces his feet. Takes aim.
aurora,Whoa. Hey. Let's talk about this.
jim,Hang on.
aurora,To what?! Jim dives at her like Superman. Wraps his arms around her. They tumble through space until Jim grabs a railing.
jim,You okay?
aurora,There's no gravity.
jim,Yeah. That's bad.
aurora,Why is there no gravity?
jim,The gravity plant's failing. Internal field goes first. After that the engines die...then the fusion reactor goes nova.
aurora,That is bad.
jim,We've got to get the core computer online. Now.
jim,The engines just shut down.
fusion reactor,"The caged sun boils and swells. Tentacles of flame graze the reactor walls, leaving charred trails."
announcer,"Reactor failure. Reactor failure. Passengers please remain calm. Aurora holds the computer in place, gripping two handholds, her shoulder planted against the machine."
jim,"Does the data cable go in the ""bus"" port or the ""through"" port?"
aurora,"Bus port! The blue one! The ship shudders violently, throwing them from side to side. Jim forces one cable after another into their sockets. Aurora tires: the computer slides out of place."
jim,Hold it! Hold it!
aurora,Trying! She strains. The computer slides back into place. Jim closes the last connection. Slips out of the niche and lowers the clamps that hold the computer in place. He throws the heavy power lever. The lights go out.
aurora,What's happening?
jim,"Don't know. The core computer flashes to life. The lights come back on. So does the gravity. Jim and Aurora slam to the floor. Inches away, the old computer plunges down and embeds itself in the deck. Across the room the golf cart bounces on its tires."
jim,What's so funny?
aurora,"We're alive! The engines rumble back to life. A distant, rhythmic sound begins: BOOM-CHAK...BOOM-CHAK..."
jim,We have to replace the other burned- out computers. But we have time. Aurora slides her arm around his waist.
aurora, Jim! He turns. Stares in shock as more pods drift past the window.
hibernation bay,Jim and Aurora sprint into the facility. The sound is loud here: BOOM-CHAK...BOOM-CHAK... It's the sound of hibernation pods being ejected. The wave of ejections marches down an aisle: one pod after another disappearing into the ceiling. Jim rushes to a CONSOLE. Scans the display.
jim,The hibernation system rebooted. It thinks the ship's in port. It's ejecting the empty pods.
aurora,  They're not empty.
aurora,Who's that?
jim,The Captain. The sounds of the ejection wave come closer. Boom-chak.
aurora,You don't have much time.
jim,I know.
jim,That's the last of the burned out processors. When it reboots we should be all green.
aurora,Can we talk?
aurora,"You know, if it wasn't for you waking me up, I'd be drifting out in space right now with the others. And if you'd never awakened, the whole ship would have been lost while we slept. Jim shakes his head at the tangle of it."
jim,I've missed you too.
aurora,"I don't want to be angry anymore. I can't be. We've come through too much. No matter what you've done... the fact is, I love you. Jim reaches out and takes her hand. She watches him intertwine his fingers with hers. Aurora gazes out at the stars - the endless shining sky that enfolds them. She looks at Jim and smiles."
jim,Hell of a life.
