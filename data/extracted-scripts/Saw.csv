Speaker,Dialogue
adam,"Help! Someone help me!  Shit, Im probably dead."
lawrence,"Youre not dead.  Adam quickly turns in the direction of the voice. Holding his arms out for balance, he tries to look across the room to whoever is speaking, but still cannot see a thing."
adam,Whos that? Whos that?!
lawrence," Theres no point in yelling, I already tried it."
adam,Turn on the lights!
lawrence,Would if I could.
adam,What the fuck is going on? Where am I? 
lawrence,I dont know yet.
adam, What is that smell?
lawrence,"Shh! Hang on a second, I think I found something."
adam,Holy shit!
adam, HELP!!! Help!
lawrence,"No one can hear you.  Adam stops pulling at the chain, stands up and looks to Lawrence, his breathing fast and heavy. His voice is not yelling anymore but still just as hysterical."
adam,What the fuck is this?
lawrence,"Calm down, just calm down.  Are you hurt?"
adam,I dont know...yeah!
lawrence, Whats your name?
adam, Whats your name? Whats going on here?
adam, Ah!  Lawrence looks at Adam with a look that seems to say Im stuck in here with THIS guy? He then glances down at the body.
lawrence,"Recognize him?  Adam continues to pull at his chains, does not and will not look at the body, just shakes his head."
adam, No.
lawrence," Well, do you have any idea how you got here?"
adam,No.
lawrence,Whats the last thing you remember?
adam,"Nothing.  So what about you, huh?"
lawrence," I was on my way home from work and uh, I dont remember anything else."
adam,First dead body Ive ever seen. Look different in real life. They dont move.
lawrence,"From the looks of these chains, someone didnt want us to go very far either."
adam,Can you see any scars?
lawrence, What?
adam,"Huh? This is what they do man, "
lawrence, No one has taken your kidneys.
adam, How can you tell from way over there?
lawrence," Because youd either be in terrible agony, or youd be dead by now. Trust me."
adam,"What are you, a surgeon? "
lawrence,"Yeah.  So, you gonna tell me your name, or what?"
adam,Adam.
lawrence," Question is what. (He sees something up on the wall, moves forwards a bit towards it. We see that it is a brand new clock on the wall, ticking away. It reads currently at"
adam,What about it?
lawrence,Its brand new. 
adam, So?
lawrence," Wait, I think I may be able to reach that door."
lawrence,What is that?  Excuse me.
adam, Its a tape.
lawrence,Where did you find it?
adam,It was in my pocket.
adam, It says Play me.
lawrence," Come on, come on, come on...."
adam, Throw it over here.
adam,Fuck. 
lawrence," No?  Adam gives up, drops the key onto the floor frustratedly, shaking his head. Thats when he looks over to the body again, and the shot closes up on the hand holding the tape recorder. A small loop handle juts out of the hands grip. Adam stands up, then bends down and picks up the tape on the floor, looking at it. He puts it back down then stretches himself flat out on the floor, trying to reach. Unfortunately, there is still a good three to four feet between him and the body."
lawrence,Use your shirt.
adam, What?
lawrence,Your shirt.
lawrence,"Come on...  Adam tries again; it misses. It is just barely reaching. He pulls the shirt back, gets back up on his knees, aggravated."
adam,It wont work.
lawrence," Well, look around, there must be something else you can use."
adam, Theres nothing.
lawrence, Well there must be something!
lawrence,"Come on, you can do it.  Adam throws it, attempting to get the plug through the loop at the end of the tape recorder. He misses."
lawrence,"Come on, come on, again.  He tries again and misses. On the third try, however, he gets the plug right through the loop. Lawrence smiles in relief. Adam very slowly pulls it back, dragging the tape recorder along the floor towards him. He picks it up, getting rid of the plug and dropping it and the shirt on the floor. He picks up the tape, pops it in and presses play, holding the tape recorder out a bit so that they can both hear, but keeping his head tilted so he can hear better. A chilling deep, raspy, sinister male voice The Jigsaw Killer comes from the tape. As it speaks, Adams expression is fearful, but the thought How does he know? can be detected."
adam,I dont get it. 
lawrence, Throw me the player.
adam," No, you throw me your tape."
lawrence," Look, were going to have to work together if we want to get out of here. Now just throw it to me."
adam, Im not going to risk breaking it! You throw me your tape!
jigsaw,"...then Alison and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon. And Ill leave you in this room to rot."
adam, Any idea who that is?
jigsaw, Let the game begin.
adam,He knows us.
lawrence,Wait a minute. 
adam," What do you think? Probably a joke, right?"
lawrence,"Shh, shh! "
jigsaw, Let the game begin.
lawrence, Listen...
jigsaw,...Follow your heart.
adam,What the hell does Follow your heart mean?
lawrence,"There! Right next to you, on the toilet."
lawrence," Come on, come on."
adam,"Oh man...(he gasps, making gagging sounds, his face turned away from the bowl. He coughs, fishes around for another brief moment, then quickly pulls back, trying to shake some of the shit off of his hand, spitting."
lawrence, Anything?
adam, No solids.
lawrence,Take off the lid.  Come on!
adam,I really wish I had checked in there first.
lawrence,Huh.  What is it?
lawrence,Hey!  Mind passing me the other one?
lawrence, I think I may know whos done this to us.
adam,What did you say? 
lawrence,Its not someone I know personally. Its...just someone I know of.
adam," Jesus Christ! Tell me, who is it?!"
lawrence,The last I heard...the police still hadnt caught him.
lawrence, And the only reason I know that is because I was a suspect.
lawrence, Ill start from the beginning.
kerry,This ones not fresh anymore. At least three weeks out. 
kerry, The door was on a timer. It was unlocked until 3:00. Then it slammed shut. He was given two hours.
tapp,Jigsaw piece. 
lawrence, The newspapers started calling him the Jigsaw Killer.
lawrence,"Actually, technically speaking, hes not really a murderer. He never killed anyone."
lawrence, He finds ways for his victims to kill themselves.
jigsaw,", so I would be careful with that candle, if I were you..."
mark, Help!!!!!
jigsaw, just might have their revenge.
kerry,"I found something else. Well, two things, actually. "
kerry, Copy that.
cut to,"Hospital room. Lawrence in his white doctors coat along with three blue-scrub clad medical students. A nurse in white stands off to the side. Lawrence is going over the patients charts. He goes over to the x-ray display, pushing the light on to view two x-rays of someones skull. He points to it with his pen as he speaks."
lawrence,Okay. This patient has an inoperable frontal lobe tumor extending across the midline. Started as colon cancer.  The patient has come in for a standard checkup by which we are able to monitor the rate at which his condition is declining.
lawrence,The patient had...
zep, Hes a very interesting person.
lawrence,"Thank you for that information, Zep.  Continuing on, the patient...."
intercom,"Dr. Gordon, Dr. Lawrence Gordon, please page the operator."
tapp,"Dr. Gordon, Im Detective Tapp, this is Detective Sing, City Homicide.  Very impressive."
lawrence,"Oh. Thank you, I do my best. "
tapp,Sorry to interrupt you while youre working.
lawrence,"Thats fine. Now, how can I help you gentlemen?"
tapp,"Are you able to tell us where you were between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. last night, Doctor?"
lawrence, Why is it that youre interested?
tapp,"Wed like to ask you a few questions about it. For your sake, I think its best if we do it down at the station. Would you like to follow us there?"
lawrence," No, Im afraid thats...thats quite out of the question. I cant just leave, I have work to do. Plus, my wife has the car today, so..."
sing," Oh, thats okay, you can ride with us. Doc."
lawrence," Im sorry, youll have to tell me again. What is this all about?"
tapp,"Is this yours, Doctor?  He puts the penlight down on the desk. Lawrence picks it up, a brief oh shit look flashing across his face only to be quickly covered up. He looks at the pen strangely. The two detectives carefully study his reaction. Lawrence looks back up at them."
lawyer,So you have no idea how your penlight showed up at the murder scene?
lawrence,Of course not!
lawyer,I have to ask. What were you doing last night.
lawrence, I was seeing someone.
lawyer," Look, if you cant be honest with me..."
lawrence, What am I gonna do?
lawyer,"Well, as your lawyer and your friend, my advice to you is to bite the bullet and give them your alibi now. Because no one is going to believe you later."
lawrence, That was five months ago. He tried to set me up for murder.
sing,Okay. We checked your alibi. It holds up. 
lawrence,Good! Can I go home now?
lawrence," Id like to help, really, but..."
sing," Well, wed really appreciate it. Shes the only one who made it."
lawrence," Okay.  Camera moves into the Interrogation room with Amanda, Tapp, and the unidentified man. As Tapp speaks, the camera slowly moves closer over his shoulder and towards Amanda. As we get closer to her, we see long, strange, scar-like markings along each side of her mouth. She is shaken, her eyes distant, never looking anyone, including Tapp, in the eye. It is clear that her mind is still lost somewhere within her nightmare."
tapp," Amanda...in your own time, tell me the first thing you remember."
amanda, And metal.
jigsaw," The device youre wearing is hooked into your upper and lower jaws. When the timer at the back goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open. Think of it like a reverse bear trap. Here, Ill show you."
jigsaw," There is only one key to open the device. Its in the stomach of your dead cellmate. Look around, Amanda. Know that Im not lying. You better hurry up. Live or die. Make your choice."
amanda,"And then I saw the body.  We switch back into Amandas cell. Over her shoulder, we see near the corner the body of a man lying on the floor on his back. Amanda cautiously approaches it, the timer still ticking away, her hands still at the device. She kneels down cautiously next to him. She reaches down and with a shaking hand lifts up his shirt, revealing a large, black question mark drawn on his abdomen. She sobs harder, hunched over him."
amanda,"There was a knife.  Back to the cell. Amanda, still leaning over, picks up a small knife next to the body. She slowly brings it up in both of her shaking hands, clutching it. She looks closer at it. A quick shot of the timer shows it to be at 25 seconds now, almost halfway. The camera moves to a shot of the mans face, when..."
sing, Hed been injected with an opiate overdose. He couldnt move or feel much of anything.
lawrence,You mean....he was alive?
sing, Was.
tapp,What happened after you took it off?
jigsaw,Congratulations. You are still alive. Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you. Not anymore.
tapp,"You are, in fact, a drug addict. Isnt that right, Mandy?  Are you grateful, Mandy?"
amanda," He...helped me.  As she starts sniffling and breathing more heavily, Tapp looks over his shoulder into Lawrences room, right in his direction. He may not see him, but he knows hes there. The camera then cuts back to Amanda, who starts sobbing more heavily again. Slowly, the camera moves down into and under the table, fading back into an overhead view of the bathroom where Lawrence and Adam are."
adam, Are you sure its him?
lawrence," Yeah, Im sure."
lawrence, Im in exactly the same situation youre in.
adam,Wrong. 
lawrence,What?
adam, Its a two-way mirror.
man, I can see you...
adam, So thats what this is. Reality TV.
man, Dont look at me. I cant help you.
adam,Can you hear me in there? Huh? Im having a blast. 
lawrence, Thats not going to do anything.
adam,You sound like you admire this prick.
lawrence, Help me find it.
adam,How can you be the calm Doctor Guy when your wife and kid are out there.  He could be doing anything to them right now. Are you thinking about that?
lawrence, Ive been the last thing I said to my daughter.
alison,"Diana, Honey, are you okay?  Diana, Honey, can you hear me?"
diana, Mommy?
alison,"Oh, what is it, sweet pea?"
diana, Theres a man in my room.
alison," Oh Honey, are you sure hes not just hiding in your imagination?"
diana,He talked to me.
diana,I want Daddy. Hell get the scary man.
alison," Alright, if you want. Come on."
alison,"Larry, sorry to bother you, but your daughter had a bad dream again."
lawrence, Just a minute.
alison,She wants you to check her room.
lawrence," Mmm hmm, mmm hmm, just gotta finish this paragraph."
alison, You know what sweetie? Ill go check with you.
lawrence,Nope! Im done. 
lawrence, Theres no one in your room. Theres no such thing as the bad man. Now can you go to sleep?
diana,Im still scared.
lawrence,You are? Give me your tootsie.  all the way home!
diana,I hate that thing.
lawrence,"Well I have to go to work, sweetheart. You know what Daddys job is like. Now, come on. "
diana,"Youre not going to leave us, are you, Daddy?"
lawrence," No, no sweetheart, I would never do that. Who gave you that idea?"
diana,No one.
lawrence,"Well its not true, okay?"
diana, Okay.
lawrence,How much do I love you?
lawrence,"Thats right, thats right!  Good night, sweetie."
diana,"Good night, Daddy.  Lawrence gets up and goes to the door, flipping the lights off. He pauses before he steps out."
lawrence,"Tomorrow, Ill read you your favourite story."
diana, Okay.
lawrence,Okay. 
alison,"I dont know how much longer I can do this, Larry."
lawrence," What, what are you talking about?"
alison, How can you walk through life pretending that youre happy?
lawrence,I am happy.
alison, Id rather you break down and tell me that you hated me. At least thered be some passion in it.
lawrence,"Would you like to see her? (He reaches into his pocket and takes out his wallet, throws it across the room to Adam, who is sitting with his back against the wall, facing Lawrence. Adam picks up the wallet and opens it. He sees two pictures of Diana, side by side. The one on the left is Diana hugging a dog. The one on the right is a smiling portrait outside somewhere."
adam,Shes beautiful.
lawrence,Thank you.
adam, You gonna have any more kids?
lawrence,"Theres another picture behind the one youre looking at.  Its my favourite one because were all in it together. Someone, usually me, has to hold the camera, which means Im always missing from the photos."
jigsaw, X Marks the spot. Sometimes you see more with your eyes shut.
adam,"Its uh, its not here."
lawrence, What?
adam,"Uh, this photo youre talking about...its not here."
lawrence, Really? Are you sure?
adam,Yeah. 
lawrence, He...he mustve taken it. I...
alison, How can you walk through life pretending that youre happy?
lawrence,I am happy. 
alison, That is complete bullshit. Id rather you break down and tell me that you hated me. At least thered be some passion in it.
alison," Just leave.  He looks at her for a moment, searching, then slowly turns away and heads out the door."
voice,"Goodnight, little girl. "
alison,Diana!?
alison,"Diana! (opens the door and flips on the light, gasps when she sees a figure covered by a blanket looming over Dianas bed. The figure suddenly grabs Diana and she screams, struggling against him. Alison goes for them."
alison,Dont do that! Leave her! Get away from her!
alison, Keep your motherfucking hands off of my daughter!
voice," What are you doing in there? Waiting for the doctor? Im waiting for the doctor, too. Hmm."
tapp,"I never should have let you go...  Camera pans up to a wall of articles, all about the Jigsaw killings. It moves quickly and zooms in on each headline we see. Jigsaw hunt brings D.A. before Judge, Missing Man discovered at Bizarre Crime Scene screaming is heard then a quick flashback shot of Paul in his cage, first struggling against the wire then hanging dead in his cage Killer Preaching Says Top Cop, Psychopath Teaches Sick Life Lessons, quick shot of Mark going around looking for the code on the walls, with the sound of his screaming over the shot, Escape, Victim Survives Maniacs Game quick flashback footage of Amanda in the interrogation room, then fighting with her mask, and a shot of Lawrence watching and listening to her testimony, Doctor Questioned in Case flash of shots of Lawrence being questioned by the Tapp and Sing and then his Lawyer. It ends on the flashback shot of Tapp looking back at Lawrence through the two-way glass after Amanda tells her story, and the shot slides into a shot of a car pulling up alongside a building."
tapp, I never shouldve let you go...
lawrence," Look, Im sorry I cant be of more help to your investigation."
jigsaw," Hello Amanda. You dont know me, but I know you. I want to play a game. Heres what happens if you lose. Theres a timer at the back of the device youre wearing. When the timer goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open."
jigsaw, Think of it like a reverse bear trap.
jigsaw, Ill show you...
sing,"Hey Tapp?  Tapp doesnt look up, resembles Lawrence in the earlier scene when Alison and Diana came to him to check her room while he was working on his paper."
tapp,Mmm?
sing,"Were gonna go down to the Grill, go get a beer. You wanna come?"
tapp,I dont think so. Thanks anyway.
jigsaw, There is only one key...
sing,Ill leave you to have fun up here. 
jigsaw, Its in the stomach of your dead cellmate.
sing, Maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend.
jigsaw, Its in the stomach of your dead cellmate.
tapp,"Wait wait wait, Sing!"
tapp,Get back here!
sing,What?
tapp,Mmm! 
sing," What?  Tapp rewinds one second then pauses, holds pencil to the screen to a grafittied wall on the video."
tapp,Remember 118th Street?
sing, Ah...K2K. That gangs territory was only about four blocks.
tapp,"Now listen to this.  They listen with the volume up high. Over the static, the sound of a fire alarm can just barely be heard in the background. They look at each other. Tapp hits stop."
tapp," We gotta check the records from all the fire emergencies that occurred there in the last two weeks. Go, right now! Mmm!"
cut to,"Close up of a map, with Sing speaking in a voiceover. As he speaks, theres a brief shot of the two of them sitting over the map, then quick shots of a few black and white photographs of a warehouse, including a close up of a street sign Stygian St."
sing," You think we have enough for a warrant, though?"
tapp,Who said anything about a warrant? 
sing, Right now?
tapp,Why not?
sing,"Yeah, why not? (He grabs his gun, snaps a cartridge into it, grabsup his coat, and quickly follows Tapp."
tapp, At least well have the cover of darkness.
sing," Yeah, well, so will anybody else."
tapp,"I got you...  They continue on, moving into a room separated with a chain link fence. There is a slightly raised platform, going along part of the wall, with a few steps leading up on either side. Tapp goes up the steps. On the raised area are some tables covered in heavy red cloth. Tapp points to one, reaches down, and pulls back the covering. He reveals a small diorama of the bathroom scene where Adam and Lawrence dolls, complete with the body, dolls representing each of them."
tapp,What the hell is this?....... Oh shit...
sing,"Oh fuck!  They both go over and stand on either side of it, taking one end of the red cloth whipping it off. Underneath is a man tied to a chair with duct tape over his mouth, held in place by a manacle around his neck. A contraption on the chair holds two power drills about six inches from either side of his head, pointed directly at his temples. His eyes wide, he moans through his tape at the detectives."
tapp, Wait Sing!
sing, What?
tapp, Lets see what hes gonna do.
sing,"Why? Weve fucking got him.  Tapp however, having studied this guy for so long, wants to get a good look at him before hes captured, see him in his element."
tapp,We dont know what he looks like. Lets see what hes gonna do.
sing, No fucking way!
tapp,"Sing, Sing! "
sing, Fuck that. Im gonna take him.
tapp,Sing!
sing,What the fuck? Shit!
tapp,"Wait Sing, listen."
jigsaw,"Awake already, Jeff? I need more powerful tranquilizers next time.  Dont cry. Ive given your life a purpose. Youre a test subject for something greater than yourself."
sing,Freeze! Police!
tapp,Hold it right there! Dont move!
sing,Put your fucking hands in the air!
jigsaw,"Now youll make a choice.  In 20 seconds, the life of this man will be ended."
tapp,Shut up and get down here!
sing, What did you do? Turn it off!
tapp,"Sing, stop that thing! Im taking this bastard down.  Move!"
sing, How do you turn it off?!
tapp,Tell him how to stop it!
jigsaw,One key will unlock it.
sing, Where is it?!
jigsaw,Its in the box.
sing,"Box!  Fuck! Which key, which key?!"
tapp,Tell him which key it is!
jigsaw, Time is running out.
tapp,"Shut up and get down here right now, asshole!"
jigsaw,"Whats more important to you Officer, arresting me or the life of another human being?"
tapp,Get down on your knees!
sing,Jesus! Tapp! Tapp!
tapp, Sick bastard.
jigsaw,"Yes, I am sick, Officer."
sing," Tapp! Its like, theres a hundred keys in here!"
jigsaw,Sick from the disease eating away at me inside. Sick of people who dont appreciate their blessings. Sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others.
sing," No, no! Tapp! Shit!"
sing," Ill be back, okay? Ill be back."
sing," Freeze or Ill shoot!  Jigsaw continues moving, so Sing fires. He hits, and Jigsaw goes down. Sing pauses, waiting to see if he gets back up. Jigsaw doesnt move, so Sing cocks the gun again and starts to slowly move forward towards him. Cut to a shot of Tapp as he struggles to his feet and starts towards the stairs to follow Sing."
tapp," Right, Sing? Right? Were gonna close it, Sing."
lawrence,X Marks the spot... What are you doing over there?
lawrence, Excuse me?
adam, Just because Im stuck in this room with you doesnt mean I have to report to you every ten seconds.
lawrence, I really dont see the point in us not helping one another.
adam,well what do you want me to do? Im on a leash.
lawrence,Thats exactly why we need to talk. We need to think!
adam,I am thinking!
lawrence, Well then dont keep me in the dark about what youre thinking!
adam,Turn off the lights.
lawrence,What?
adam," Turn them off now, please!"
lawrence, Why?
adam, Just turn them off for a second!
adam,"Jesus, behind you!"
lawrence, How come we didnt see that before?
adam,The lights in here hadnt charged it. It must be glow in the dark paint or something.
adam, Open it!
lawrence," The key, the one from my envelope. Where is it?"
adam, Cell phone. The most beautiful invention on this planet!
adam,Make that second most beautiful invention!  Give me that.
lawrence,Are you joking? Youre gonna put something we found in this room in your mouth?
adam," I dont care, I really dont. Give me one of those."
jigsaw," The cigarettes are harmless, I promise. Smoking is only poisonous when it ends in bloodshed. Think about this - you dont need a gun to kill Adam."
adam, May I please have a cigarette?
lawrence, Wait a minute...this has happened before.
lawrence, How did you know to turn off the lights?
adam,Who cares? It worked.
lawrence,"Yeah, but how did you know?"
lawrence, Instinct?
adam,Yeah.
lawrence,You know what?  Youre a terrible liar.
adam, You say that like you know me.
lawrence, What else arent you telling me?
adam," who was a feminist vegan punk, broke up with me because she thought I was too angry. Uh, I havent told you that one of my toenails is slightly..."
lawrence, Just stop it. You knew to turn off these lights.
adam, What-ever.
lawrence, Im dealing with a juvenile.
adam, You wanna know?
lawrence," Yeah!  Adam leans down and reaches into the bathtub, pulls out and holds up the picture of Alison and Diana."
lawrence, W...where did you get this?
adam," It was in your wallet, behind the photo of your daughter."
lawrence,W...why didnt you show me this before?
adam,I couldnt. 
lawrence,What are you doing to them you bastard?! 
jigsaw,", the only thing left to do is shoot yourself."
adam,"What are you doing?  Lawrence goes to the light, looks at the camera, suddenly flips off the lights. We see a shot of Zep startling when the lights go out on the monitor, then we go back to the darkened bathroom."
adam,Hey! What the hell are you doing?
lawrence," Adam, listen to me. I want you to play along with me on this."
lawrence,"You got that? (he turns the lights back on, both of them again wincing at the bright light. Lawrence glances at the surveillance camera, then looks to Adam."
lawrence," So you uh, still want that cigarette?"
adam,"Um...yeah, sure.  Lawrence makes a show of reaching into the box where the poisoned cigarette is, but takes the other un-dipped one instead. He throws it to Adam, who reaches down and picks it up from where it lands. Lawrence throws the lighter as well. Adam puts the cigarette between his lips and reaches down, picking up the lighter. He glances over at Lawrence, who watches him intently. Adam just shrugs then lights up. He takes a long drag, then exhales in a sigh of relief and with a smile. He takes another drag then suddenly freezes, his head jerking and a strange gurgling sound coming from his throat. His head jerks more then the rest of his body, his eyes widening. His hand drops the cigarette and goes to his throat as he turns, still jerky and making a strange, almost squeaky choking sound in his throat. The sound grows louder as he falls to his knees, then back a bit, his left arm held out in front of him dramatically. He falls backwards onto the floor, twitching some more, still choking. He lets out a long cough, suddenly stops jerking, and closes his eyes. The death in its entirety is very, very fake."
lawrence, Now wheres my family?! Where are they?!
adam, Jesus Christ!!
lawrence, What?
adam, I just got electrocuted!
lawrence,What?  That was our way out!
adam, Get this thing off me! Get it off!
lawrence, Stop acting!
adam, You think I would make that up just to mess up your stupid fucking charade?
lawrence," Ah, Damn it!!"
adam, I remember how I got here.
adam,"Great.  Suddenly, he hears something move outside the door, somewhere in his apartment. On alert, he listens. He looks down and picks up his camera, slinging it around his neck and holding it out in front of him. He opens the creaky door into his also pitch-black apartment. He takes a few steps forward, speaks nervously, but trying to be brave."
adam,Is someone there? 
adam, What the...
adam,Who is that?! Whos in there?! 
lawrence, Who is this?
diana, Daddy?
lawrence,Diana? 
diana,"Daddy, is that you? "
diana," Im scared, Daddy."
lawrence," Dont worry honey, everythings going to be okay. Wheres Mommy?"
diana,Shes here with me.
lawrence," Let me talk to her sweetie, okay? Put Mommy on."
diana,The bad man from my room is here. He has us tied up and he has a gun.
lawrence,W...what man?
diana,Please come home Daddy! 
lawrence,Hello? Hello? Diana?  Zep pushes some of Alisons hair behind her ear with the barrel of the gun.
lawrence, Diana! Diana!
alison,Larry?
lawrence,Ally? Is that you? 
alison,Is Adam there?
lawrence," How do you know? Ally, what is going on?"
adam, Are they okay?
lawrence," My wife, she uh, she mentioned your name."
adam, What did she say?
lawrence, She told me...not to believe you.
lawrence, Who are you?
adam, You know who I am.
lawrence, Stop the lies! Youre a liar! I need to know the truth!
adam," What did you do last night, Lawrence? Work at a hospital? Saving sick children? You told me that after you left your house last night, you went to work at a hospital."
lawrence, Thats because its the truth.
adam, You dont recall getting your picture taken in that parking lot?
adam,I can prove that you didnt go anywhere near a hospital last night. 
lawrence, But...why?
adam,"You wanna know what I do? I get paid to take pictures of rich guys like you who go to seedy, out-of-the-way motels to fuck their secretaries. "
lawrence," Youve uh, had these with you the whole time?"
adam,"I found them, in there  I dont know how they got there."
adam," Aww, face it, Larry, were both bulls hitters. But my camera isnt. It doesnt know how to lie. It only shows you whats put right in front of it. Just out of curiosity, what did you do in that motel room? You got out of there pretty fast."
lawrence,"Why did you um, deem it necessary to page me when you knew I was at home?"
carla,I didnt know if you were going to make it. 
lawrence, You cant do that.
carla,"Its not like I know the rules for this sort of stuff.  Whats wrong, Dr. Gordon?"
lawrence," Look, it was wrong for me to makes you come here."
carla, But I thought we-
lawrence,-Please. 
lawrence,You tell anyone you were here?
carla,No. 
lawrence,For me?  Hello?
voice,I know what youre doing...Doctor.
lawrence,I- 
lawrence, I have to go.
carla,What happened?
lawrence,"Ive got to go. (He picks up his briefcase from the chair, and heads out the door."
lawrence,Who was it?
adam,Who was what?
lawrence,"The person who paid you to follow me, who was it?"
adam," He calls himself Bob and he gives me the money up front. Two hundred bucks a night. If Id have known I was gonna end up here, I wouldve asked for a hell of a lot more."
lawrence, What does that mean? Does that mean you saw what happened to me?
adam," and went straight home to develop the. Next thing I know Im chained to a pipe in some prehistoric bathroom, staring at the guy Ive been taking shots of all night."
lawrence," Clearly, whoever paid you to take the pictures of me is the one who put is in here."
adam, Maybe.
lawrence,Maybe? What do you mean maybe? Of course it is! What did he look like?
lawrence,"Was he tall, was he skinny, obese, what?"
adam,I dont take notes about his appearance. 
lawrence, You must remember something about him.
adam,I cant. 
lawrence,Youre telling me you dont remember a thing about the guy?
adam,"I told you, I- "
lawrence, Oh for fucks sake! I give up!
lawrence,Tapp!  Detective Tapp!
adam,"Whoa, the guy who paid me to take these photos was not a cop."
lawrence,"No, no, he was discharged from the police force.  You took money from him to invade my privacy. How could you do that?"
adam, Call it my need to eat.
adam,Oh really? Obviously this cop thinks youre the one behind it all.
adam, What are you more pissed off about? The fact that I took some shots of you or the fact that I took some shots of you while you were cheating on your wife?
lawrence,I did not cheat on her!!!
adam,What do you care what I think anyway? I dont give a crap if you covered yourself in peanut butter and had a 15-hooker gang bang!
alison,"Sweetheart, are you okay? "
adam,"Hey, was there someone else at your house last night besides your wife and daughter?"
lawrence, No.
lawrence, Zep. You perverted little psychopath. Im gonna take great pleasure in seeing you pay for this! You bastard fuck!
adam,"Look. (Lawrence momentarily breaks from his Zep rage, looks up. The clock reads"
diana," Mommy help me!  Alison continues to untie her. Cut to Zep, getting up from his chair, turning to go into the bedroom. Alison hears him moving near, sees his form through the frosted glass doors. She quickly replaces Dianas gag and then her own, and resumes her position with her hands behind her back just as the doors open and Zep steps into the room. He looks down at them, raises his eyebrows slightly. He seems to have gotten himself together, ready to just do what has to be done. He takes the gun from his belt and leans down next to Alison. He looks at her with wide eyes, shakes his head sadly. He speaks calmly."
zep,"Dr. Gordons time is up. Now Ive gotta do what Ive gotta do, and...Im afraid it has to be you that tells him he failed. "
lawrence," I know its you, you son of a bitch!"
alison,Larry?
lawrence, Ally?
alison, You failed.
lawrence, Hello? Hello?
alison,"Dont move, stay on the ground. Give me the phone. Give it to me!  Larry?"
lawrence,"Ally! Honey, are you all right?"
alison,"No! No were not... Get down! Larry, where are you?"
lawrence, I dont know. Im being held captive in a room somewhere.
alison, What? What are you talking about?
lawrence," Im so sorry, Ally."
lawrence, Im sorry for everything. Its my fault. Please forgive me. Ive always been happy with you.
diana," Mommy!  Alison turns to look at Diana when she calls her, and Zep seizes the moment. He leaps up and grabs the gun from her hand, and they start struggling with it. Diana starts screaming. Lawrence, on his end, hears the screaming and sounds of a struggle. In wrestling for the gun a shot is let off, and Diana continues to scream."
lawrence," Ally!  Cut to a shot of static on Tapps TV set, then Tapp waking up to the sound of gunfire. He quickly looks over to the window."
diana,"Mommy, help me!"
tapp,"Freeze!  Zep turns and sees him, fires a shot in his direction but doesnt hit. Tapp fires back and skims the top of Zeps head. Zep clutches the surface wound, fires back. Cut back to Lawrence on the phone, hearing only his daughter screaming and gunshots. He sobs, collapsing forward onto the floor, crying out Oh no. Adam watches him, can only imagine what hes hearing."
tapp, What the fuck?
zep,"Mrs. Gordon?  Im gonna kill your husband now, Mrs. Gordon. (He stands up a bit straighter and hobbles over to the computer station, taking keys from the desk and then hobbling down the hall and out the door. We see Tapp groaning, starting to get up. Zep glances over and sees Tapp get to his feet, but quickly hobbles to the doorway and out the door. Tapp starts to follow, just a we bit dazed from the hit. He empties his gun cartridge and replaces it, then runs towards the door, screaming."
adam,"Lawrence!  Lawrence, get up!"
cut to,"Car Chase! Zep is in the lead, with Tapp in hot pursuit behind him. They race through the streets as fast as they can."
adam," Oh, thank God! I thought you were dead!"
lawrence, He...he electrocuted me...
adam,"I told you! The same thing happened to me, see? I wasnt lying, see?"
lawrence," FUCK THIS SHIT!!  Back in the bathroom, Lawrence continues to grunt and struggle with his chain. Suddenly the phone rings and he turns. He quickly moves to get it, but it is out of reach. He lays flat on the floor, just a foot away from it, trying desperately to grab it."
lawrence,No!!!! 
adam," Lawrence, I have a family too! I dont see them, thats my mistake. Its a mistake Id like to fix!"
tapp,Im gonna kill you you sick asshole!
adam," Lawrence, stop it!"
adam," Lawrence, please calm down! Theres a way out of here, theres a way out!"
adam,Lawrence! No! Oh my God! What are you doing?!
adam,What are you...
adam,"Oh my God! Oh my God! Lawrence dont!  Lawrence, its not me who did this to you!"
lawrence, You have to die.
adam," No, I want to live!"
lawrence, Im sorry...
adam,I want to live!
lawrence,My family...
lawrence,Ive done it! Now show them to me! 
neighbor," Thank you very much, Officer."
alison, Larry?
neighbor, Did you get through to him?
alison,Theres still no answer.
neighbor, Its all right. Ive called the police. Everythings okay.
lawrence,You bastard! Ill fucking kill you!  Ill fucking kill you! You fucking bastard! Ill fucking kill you! Ill fucking kill you!
zep,Youre too late.
lawrence, Why?
zep,Its the rules.
lawrence, Youre just wounded in the shoulder. I have to go and get help.
adam, Dont leave me! No!
adam,No!!  Lawrence! Lawrence!
adam," Key...key...  He starts going through Zeps pockets, patting him down. He finds Zeps wallet, opens it and feels through it; there s nothing of value to him right now. He tosses it down. He continues feeling for something, suddenly feels something in Zerps coat pocket. His eyes widen as he reaches in, wincing from the pain in his shoulder. He pulls out a tape recorder. He stares at it, his eyes and mouth starting to widen. He glances down at Zep, then at the tape recorder. Sitting up a bit more, he presses play. It is Jigsaws voice."
john,The key to that chain is in the bathtub.
johns voice,"Sick of people who dont appreciate their blessings. Shot of Lawrence with Diana, checking his beeper, on his computer ignoring Diana and Alison, trying to kiss Alison as she pulls away."
john, I want to play a game.
john, Not anymore.
john,"GAME OVER.  John slams the door shut the rest of the way, and we are left in darkness with the sound of Adam screaming No! Dont!!! over and over and crying. The screams fade out, and is replaced by the ending titles and instrumental music."
