speaker,"""National Liberation Front, bulletin number 24. Brothers of the Casbah! The colonial administration is responsible not only for our people's great misery, but also for the degrading vices of many of our brothers who have forgotten their own dignity ..."""
speaker,"""Corruption and brutality have always been the most dangerous weapons of colonialism. The National Liberation Front calls all the people to struggle for their own physical and moral redemption -- indispensable conditions for the reconquest of independence. Therefore beginning today, the clandestine authority of the NLF prohibits the following activities: gambling, the sale and usage of all types of drugs, the sale and usage of alcoholic beverages, prostitution and its solicitation. Transgressors will be punished. Habitual transgressors will be punished by death."""
madam,"No. He left early this morning. You know how it is with the boss ...  ALI I want to see him. If he shows up, tell him that I'm around.  Ali moves away from the counter and turns.

speaker,"""The Governor-General of Algiers decrees: Article No. 1 -- The sale of medicinal and pharmaceutical products, effective for the cures of gunshot wounds, can be made only to those who present written authorization from the Commissioner of Police."
speaker,"""The Prefecture of Algiers states: In the course of these last few days, dozens of assaults have been committed in this city. We have reason to believe that the assailants originate in the Casbah, and that they have always found a speedy and easy refuge in the alleys of the Arab quarters. As a result, and in order to alleviate without delay the insecurity that now reigns in the city, the Prefecture of Algiers has decided that entrance to the Casbah can only he permitted at those points in the blockade under military control, where citizens in transit must exhibit their documents at request, and submit to eventual searches."""
officer,"Are you mad, touching one of their women? Go on, go on, alright ... Go ahead, keep moving!"

employee,"Good evening, sir.  The employee salutes, then moves toward the door. He is about to go out when the Assistant Commissioner stops him.  ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thbes?"
employee,"Rue de Thbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ..."
employee,"Good evening, sir.  The employee leaves and closes the door. The Assistant Commissioner crosses the room to the large map of Algiers which covers the entire wall. He moves his finger along the Casbah zone; as he moves it, he follows it with his glance in that tangle of streets.  ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER  Hello, Engineer Henry Amaud, please ... He's already left? Alright, yes, yes, alright ... I have the number."
assistant commissioner,"Hello, Bernadette...Yes, right away. I'm going to change my clothes first, and I'll be right there. My wife is already there, right? No, it's not important. But call Henry for me. Just for a minute ... Alright ... thanks ..."

hassiba,"a va, monsieur?"
hassiba,I've come to take the package ...
zohra,I've come to take the package ...
soldier,"I'd like to search you, Miss ...  For an instant, Hassiba is dismayed; then, she glances down at her clinging shirt and pants."
soldier,Not here. There's too many people.
soldier,That's what you think!
second soldier,"Are you going for a swim, Miss ... all by yourself?"
second soldier,Lucky them. Next Sunday I'm free .... Shall we go together?
algerian,May Allah protect you.
hassiba,I'm giving your seat back.
man,"Are you already leaving, Miss?"
hassiba,Good evening ...
man,Good evening ...
child,"Ice cream ...  The father and mother are watching him, delighted. The waiter smiles at the child and points to the cash register. He speaks to the child in the usual tone of a grownup when speaking to children:"
waiter,"You have to go there first ... and then come back to me.  The second hand reaches twenty-five, then thirty. The child goes to the cashier and pays. The cashier smiles at him and gives him the check."
cashier,"What a good boy ...  The child returns to the counter. The waiter has already prepared the ice cream for him, and hands it to him. The child is standing on tiptoes."
commissioner,What time is it?
policeman,A quarter to seven.

In particular, it has been decided to recall the 'Tenth' Division of paratroopers to Algiers that, until now, has been employed in the antiguerrilla operations on the Cabiro plateau.

mathieu,"Go ahead, Martin.  Martin turns on the projector. On the white wall next to the map and graph appear pictures of the Casbah. There are the blockades, the barbed wire, the metal screens, the Algerians who exit and enter, the policemen and soldiers who examine documents and frisk someone. From time to time, close-ups of the pictures are shown, enlarged to the minutest details, close-ups of faces, motionless images that last only for a few seconds."
mathieu,We must start again from scratch. The only information that we have concerns the structure of the organization. And we shall begin from that ...
speaker,"""Algerian brothers! A great hope has arisen for us. The world is watching us. The next few days may be decisive for our future and our freedom. The colonial powers will attempt to demonstrate to the UN that the NFL does not represent the will of our people. Our response will be unanimous support of the general strike."""
speaker,"""During the eight days of the strike, do not frequent the European city, or leave the Casbah. Provide lodgings in your homes for the poor, the beggars, the brothers who do not have homes. Store provisions of food and water for eight days!"""
officer,"No. They continue to enter, the rats."
officer,But do you believe that the strike will be widespread?
general,"Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...  MATHIEU A name?"

general,"Champagne ... Champagne.  Operation Champagne, yes, alright."
policeman,Go on! Go on!
voices,Of course ... I was just going to work ...
loudspeaker,"""Attention, people of the Casbah! The NLF wants to stop you from working. The NLF forces you to close your shops. Inhabitants of the Casbah, rebel against their orders. France is your country. France has given you civilization and prosperity: schools, streets, hospitals. People of the Casbah, show your love for your mother country, by disobeying the terrorists' orders. Algerians, return to work!"""
para's voices,"Who are you? What's your name? Occupation? Where do you work? Why did you strike? They forced you, eh? ... No ... Tell the truth! You promised them, right? Then you're the one who wants to strike. Do you belong to the NLF? C'mon, answer me! Are you afraid to say it? Never mind, it doesn't matter."
loudspeaker,"""Attention, Algerians! The NLF wants to stop you from working. The NLF forces you to close your shops. The NLF wants to starve you and condemn you to misery. Algerians, return to work ... !"""
paras," Sweep, mes enfants, sweep."
loudspeaker,"""French citizens! Europeans of Algiers! The strike called by the NLF is a failure. Do not be afraid. Return to your jobs. General Massu guarantees your safety. The Army will protect you!"""
a journalist,"We are now in the fourth day and the strike continues, with total support by the Arab population. The city is very calm. However -- Calm ... Are you deaf? The city is peaceful. In the Moslem quarters, in the outskirts of the city, in the Casbah ... Bye, will call again, I'm busy."
first journalist,Will you tell us what is happening?
officer,"It is an armed insurrection ...  They have arrived at the second-floor landing, hurry along, and stop in front of a large door, where there is a written sign: PREFECT. Mathieu, at the same time, has continued speaking."

sergeant,Third group. What's your assignment?
algerian voice,Who is it?
para,Sid Ahmed ... Sid Ahmed Sail.
speaker,"""At the General Assembly of the United Nations, none of the motions presented in the course of the debate has obtained the necessary majority. At last an agreement has been reached on a resolution that excludes any form of direct intervention by the UN in the Algerian question. The Assembly of the United Nations has limited itself to expressing the hope that in a spirit of cooperation, a peaceful, democratic, and just solution will be found, that conforms to the principles of the United Nations Charter ..."""
mathieu,Good ... Good work ... Now we can all go to sleep.
loudspeaker,"""Attention! Attention! Inhabitants of the Casbah! The terrorist Ben Amin has been executed this morning. Qrara Normendine has been arrested. Boussalem Ali has been arrested. Bel Kasel Maussa has been arrested. Inhabitants of the Casbah! The NFL has been defeated. Rebel against the remaining terrorists who want to force you to continue a bloody and futile struggle. People of the Casbah, the terrorist Ben Amin has been executed. Help us to build a free and peaceful Algeria. Inhabitants of the Casbah, the NLF has been defeated.

Inhabitants of the Casbah -- the NLF has been defeated ..."""
mourad,And our movements?
loudspeaker,"""Inhabitants of the Casbah! The rebellion gets weaker every day. The terrorist Ben Amin has been executed. Kasem Moussa has been arrested. He was commander of the 2nd Sector NLF. Inhabitants of the Casbah! The terrorists are not your true brothers. Leave them to their fate. Rely on the protection of the French army. Denounce the terrorists and agitators. Cooperate with us to reestablish peace and prosperity in Algeria ..."""
speaker,"""To all NLF militants! Reorganize! Replace your fallen and arrested brothers. Make new contacts! This is a grave moment. Resist brothers! The General Staff leaves you free to take any and all necessary offensives ..."
speaker,"""Our hearts are breaking before such outrages, our houses invaded, our families massacred. Brothers, rebel! Bring terror to the European city!"""
mourad,Who is speaking?  MATHIEU Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
mourad,"We don't trust you, colonel. Come forward, show yourself."
mourad,"Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender."
mourad,We'll lower a basket from the window ...
mourad," A newspaper too, or a piece of paper ..."
mourad," Are you ready, colonel?"
mathieu,"You go ...  Mourad's face has remained motionless. In his expression there is a shade of disappointment. He sees Mathieu retrace his steps toward the door, and is now surrounded by a group of paratroopers ...  MOURAD  Hurry up, black bastard!"
mathieu,Which one of you is Fathia?
mathieu,Is it you?  The woman nods yes.
mathieu,"If you had let me blow you up, you would have disappointed me ..."
kader,Why?
sadek,"Then the beach is okay, Ali.  Silence. Sadek looks at him again, waiting, but Ali does not respond.  Ali looks straight ahead at the street bathed in sunlight, the tar that seems to be liquid, the villas that surround Algiers, the lemon trees, the oleanders ... Then he speaks, but without turning to Sadek. He speaks in a whisper, his eyes continually staring straight ahead.  ALI We need two more, the biggest ones."
sadek,And the others?
sadek,"I've looked, Ali, even where I work. Nothing. The ones who have not been arrested have left Algiers and gone into the mountains ... And the others don't want to hear any more about it ... they're afraid ..."
sadek,"Yes, sure ... here."
sadek,If we don't find any others ... should we call it off?
sadek,"We can't plant all of them by ourselves ...  Ali speaks to him in a dry and indifferent voice.  ALI You don't have to plant anything. You only have to carry them, that's all."
mahmoud,"It's almost time, isn't it?"
hassiba,I'm ready.
mahmoud,I heard the sound of a truck before ...
mahmoud,"So-so ...  Ali has finished putting on his shoes. He takes a cup of coffee. In the same moment, outside the door is heard:  MACHINE-GUN FIRE.  The four are startled.  ALI  Inside! Inside!"
hassiba,What are you going to do?  ALI I don't deal with them.
general,"And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over."
general,Let's hope forever.  Another colonel intervenes:
journalist,"No one knows what could have been the pretext. The fact is that they seem to be unleashed without warning ... I telephoned Lausanne ... yes, Lausanne. I spoke with an NLF leader in exile. They don't know anything there."
voices,Algerie! Mu-sul-mane! Algerie Musulmane!
voices,Free Ben-Bel-la! Free Ben-Bel-la!
voices,Ta-hia Et-thou-ar! [Long live the partisans!]
