Speaker,Dialogue
doctor,"Shet11 live. KATE closes her eyes. I can tell you now, I thought she wouldn't,"
kate,Doctor. Will my girl be all right?
kate,Is there nothing we should do?
doctor,"Just let her get well, she knows how to do it better than we do. These things come and go in infants, never know why. Call it acute congestion of the stomach and brain. KELL ? moves after the DOCTOR, we hear them off-camera; we see only KATE'S face hovering over us, her hand adjust- ing the blanket."
keller,"I'll see you to your buggy, Doctor."
kate,"Hush. Don't you cry now, you've been trouble enough. Call it acute congestion, indeed, I don't see what's so cute about a con- gestion, just because it's yours? We'll have your father run an editorial in his paper, the wonders of modern medicine, they don't know what they're curing even when they cure it. Men, men and their battle scars, we women will have to -- Helen, Helen Captain, Captain, will you come. "
keller,"Katie, what's wrong?"
kate,Look.
keller,Helen. Heleni
kate,She can't hear youl
helenl,"His face has something like fury in it, crying the child's name; KATE almost fainting presses her knuckles to her mouth, to stop her own cry."
percy,Why you cuttin' off that doctor's legs?
martha,"I'm gonna give him a operation. Now I'm gonna cut off his arms, one, two. Now I'm gonna fix up She pushes HELEN'S hand away from her mouth. You stop that."
percy,"Cut off his stomach, that's a good operation."
martha,"No, I'm gonna cut off his head first, he got a bad cold."
percy,"Ain't gonna be much of that doc- tor left to fix up, time you finish all them opera-- But HELEN is poking her fingers inside his mouth, to feel his tongue; he bites at them, annoyed, and she jerks them away. HELEN now fingers her own lips, moving them in imitation, but soundlessly. Again the CAMERA on this."
martha,"What you do, bite hand?"
percy,"That's how I do, she keep pokint. her fingers in my mouth, I just bite 'em off."
peercy,"She tryint talk. She gonna get read. Looka her try in' talk.. ILLEN is scowling, the lips under her fingertips moving in silence, growing more and more frantic, until in a bizarre rage she bites at her own fingers. This sends PERCY off into laughter, but alarms :MARTHA."
marti,"Hey, you stop now. She pulls EELEI' S hand down, You just sit quiet and But at once HELEIT topples LTARTHA on her back, knees pinning her shoulders down, and ;-ravs the sissors. MARTHA screams, hile her tied b _nchlets of hair f17 off in snips of the scissors. PERCY darts to the bell stria on the porch, yanks it W THE DELL"
bate," Helen. She is dorm the steps at once to them, seizing Ii LE'TT S wrists and lifting her off IARTHA. VINE= runs in and chases MARTHA and PERCY OFF."
aunt ev,"Arthur, something ought to be done for that child."
aunt ev,"'-Thy, this ver-T famous Perkins School in Poston; they're just supposed to do wonders."
aunt ev,"What, child? Obviously not hearing, HELEN commences to go around from person to person, tapping her eyes, but no one attends or understands."
kate," As long as there's the least chance. For her to see. Or hear, or --"
keller,There isntt. Now I must finish here.
kate,"I think, with your permission, Captain, I'd like to write to the Perkins School."
keller,"I said no, Katie."
feller,They can't.
kate,"We won't know that; to be a fact, Captain, until afLLer you write."
kate, What?
james,Some asylum. It's the kindest thing.
aunt ev,"Why, she's your sister, James, not a nobody --"
james,"Half sister, and half-mentally defective, she can't even keep herself clean. It's not pleasant to see her about all the time."
kate,Do you dare? Complain of what 0 you can see?
keller," This discussion is at an end] HELEN gropes her way with the doll back to AUNT EV. The house is at sixes and sevens from morning 'til night over the childl I want some peace here, I don't care how, but one way we won't have it is by rushing up and down the country every time someone hears of a new quack. I'm as sensible to this affliction as --"
aunt ev,Helena My buttons.
kate,"Eyes? HELEN nods energetically. She wants the doll to have eyes. Another kind of silence now, while KATE takes pins and buttons from the sewing basket and attaches them to the doll as eyes. KELLER stands, caught, and watches morosely, AUNT EV blinks and conceals her emotion by inspecting her dress."
aunt ev,"My goodness me, I'm not decent."
kate,"She doesn't know better, Aunt Ev. I'll sew them on again."
keller,"Helen! All are in commotion, the baby screams, but HELEN un- perturbed is lying her doll in its place, KATE on her"
kate,"Helen, Helen, you're not to do such things, how can I make you"
keller, Katie.
kate,"How can I get it into your head, my darling, my poor --"
keller,"Katie, some way of teaching her an iota of discipline has to be"
keller,I didn't say it was her fault.
kate,"Then whose? I don't know what to dot How can I teach her, beat her -- until she's black and blue?"
keller,"It's not safe to let her run around loose. Now there must be a way of confining her, somehow, so she can't---"
kate,"Where, in a cage? She's a growing child, she has to use her limbs!"
keller,"Answer me one thing, is it fair to Mildred here?"
keller,Now what?
kate,"She wants to talk, like -- be like you and me. She holds HELEN struggling until we HEAR from the child her first sound so far, an inarticulate weird noise in her throat such as an animal in a trap might make; and KATE releases her. The second she is free, HELEN blunders away collides violently with a chair, falls, and sits weeping. KATE comes to her, embraces, caresses, soothes her, and buries her own face in her hair, until she can control her voice."
aunt ev,"Oh, I've a mind to write to Boston myself. If that School can't help her, maybe they'll know somebody who can."
keller," I'll write to Perkins, Katie. He stands with the baby in his clasp, staring at HELEN'S head, hanging down on KATE'S arm."
anagnos,"0 -- only that a suitable governess has been found here and will come. It will no doubt be difficult for you there, Annie, but it has been difficult for you at our school too, hmmm?"
anagnos,"...-This is my last time to counsel you, Annie, and you do lack some -- by some I mean all -- what, tact, or talent to bencT. To others. And what has saved you on one or more occasions at Perkins is that there was nowhere to expel you to. Above ANNIEIS seat ANAGNOS puts her suitcase, looking .down at her. Your eyes hurt?"
annie,"My ears, Mr. Anagnos."
anagnos, What?
annie,"0 Well, he keeps digging up that battle."
anagnos,"That is not a proper thing to say. Annie, be humble. He extends a gift to her.. You'll need their affection, work- ing with this child. ANNIE, not quite comprehending, looks at gift. A gift with our affection. ANNIE opens a small box and sees a garnet ring. She looks up, blinking, then down."
annie,"Dear Mr. Anagnos, "
annie,"Which half? The train lurches. ANAGNOS bends and kisses her on the cheek and says,"
anagnos,Goodbye. Goodbye.
annie,(She calls after him
girl,"It's his hip, N ster, he was born that way. is AN' S VOICE Can't he walk without that crutch? The GIRL shakes her head."
