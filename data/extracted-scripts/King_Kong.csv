anny,That's a funny one! Isn't that funnier?
harry,"It's hysterical, Manny. As long as we're laughing we won't be crying over the box office. Talk about depressing."
ann,Twenty girls in feather boas prancing around like circus ponies! That's depressing!
maude, I love a good chorus line!
taps,What's this?
ann,It's a play.
manny,"Who wrote it, Annie?"
taps,Some guy - Driscoll. reading the jacket of book) From the Federal Theatre.
aude,"Don't knock it, honey - at least they get an audience."
ann,"It'll pick up .... Ain't that right, Manny?"
manny,The trick is to start the build right at the back of your throat...  Works well out through the nose too.
ann,Have you eaten today?
manny," Oh, I'm not hungry. Don't worry about me. ANN Hey - you're all I've got."
manny,You think the kitchen'll still be open on Third?
ann,Soup and biscuits - perfect.
ann," Hey! Harry, what's going on?"
ladder man,Not anymore.
maude, It's all right for you! We haven't had a pay check in two weeks - how we going to eat?
ann,They're not going to get away with this.
aude,They just did.
ann," Oh, hello Mr. Weston?!"
weston,"Oh, Jeez ..."
ann,Why would I want to do that when we can talk about it in person?
weston,Because that's what a smart girl would do.
ann,But I already sent you my resume - you returned it unopened.
weston,What can I say? Jack Driscoll's very particular about who he works with.
ann,"Please, just an audition - that's all I'm asking."
weston,"esus - you don't give up, do you?"
ann,"Mr. Weston, I know this role backwards."
eston,"ell, that's too bad - because we just gave the part to someone else. Sorry, kid - the play is cast."
zelman,How much more is there?
assistant,Another five reels.
zelman,Lights up.
thuggish investor,"This is it? This is what we get for our forty grand, Denham? Another one of your Safari pictures?"
leazy investor,You promised us romantic scenes with Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie.
denham,"Come on, fellas - you know the deal - we agreed to push Maureen's start date so she could get her teeth fixed."
thuggish investor,It's not the principle of the thing - it's the money.
elman,Carl - you've been in production for over two months -
denham,"Trust me, Bruce and Maureen are gonna steam up the screen - once we get them on the ship. Z ELMAN What ship?"
denham,The one we've hired to get to the location.
zelman,What location? Carl - you're supposed to be shooting on the back-lot.
denham,"Yes, I understand that - but fellas, we're not making that film anymore - and I'll tell you why."
zelman,Whoa! Carl - slow down!
sleazy investor,Is he askin' for more money?
thugish investor,He's asking us to fund a wild goose- chase.
denham,I'm talking about a primitive world ... never before seen by man! The ruins of an entire civilisation - the most spectacular thing you've ever seen!  That's where I'll shoot my picture!
sleazy investor,Will there be boobies?
denham,"Excuse me, boobies?"
sleazy investor,"Jigglies, jablongers, bazoomers! ... In my experience people only go to these films to observe the ... undraped form of the native girls."
denham,"What are you - an idiot? You think they asked De Mille to waste his time on nudie shots? No - they respected the film maker, they showed some class! Not that you'd know what that means - you cheap low-life!"
zelman,"Would you step outside for a moment, Carl?"
denham,Gimme that - quick!
preston,"You won't like it, it's non-alcoholic!"
denham,"Preston, you have a lot to learn about the motion picture business."
zelman,"Don't write him off fellas. He's hot- headed sure, but Carl Denham's made some interesting pictures, he's had a lot of ... near success."
thuggish investor, He's a preening self promoter ...
thuggish investor,This jumped up little turd's gonna bankrupt us.
zelman,The animal footage has value?
sleazy investor,Sure ... Universal are desperate for stock footage.
thuggish investor,Then sell it! Scrap the picture! We gotta retrieve something from this debacle. Z ELMAN nods ... gestures to the YOUNG ASSISTANT.
zelman,Get him back in.
young assistant,Mr. Denham?
denham,I want the cast and crew on the ship within the hour.
reston,"o Carl, you can't do this!"
denham,Tell `em the studio's pressured us into an early departure.
preston,It's not ethical!
denham,hat are they gonna do - sue me? They can get in line! I'm not going to let them kill my film.
reston,ou realize none of the camera equipment is on board. We have no permits ... no visas ...
denham,"hat's why I have you, Preston."
reston,"We have no insurance, no foreign currency - in fact, we have no currency of any kind -"
denham,Get in there!
preston,ho's gonna pay for the ship?
sleazy investor,Get out of there!
denham,tep on it!
sleazy investor," You're finished, Denham!"
denham,on't worry Preston - I've had a lot of practice at this: I'm real good at crapping the crappers.
denham,And two dozen of Mr. Walker's finest ...
denham,"You got it ... and tell Maureen - she doesn't have six hours to put on her face. If she wants to be in this picture, she's gotta be on that boat!"
preston,She doesn't want to be in this picture.
denham,She pulled out?!
reston,Yesterday. I told you.
denham," You said we were shooting in Singapore, right? That's what you told her?"
preston,But we're not shooting in Singapore.
denham,"exasperation) Goddammit, Preston! All you had to do is look her in the eye and lie."
preston,he`s unavailable.
preston,Mae West?! No! She has to be a size four!
preston,ou gotta get a girl who'll fit Maureen's costumes.
denham, Fay's a size four!
preston,"es she is, but she is doing a picture with RKO."
denham,ooper huh?  I might have known.
preston,We gotta delay the shoot - shut production down ... We can't sail tonight!
denham,Not an option.
reston,Carl!
denham,I said I'd find a girl.
vendor, You gonna pay for this?
denham,"Vaudeville huh? I worked Vaudeville once... that is a tough audience. If you don't kill them fast, they kill you."
ann,"Mr. Denham - I want you to know that I'm not in the habit of accepting charity from strangers, or for that matter ... taking things that don't belong to me. D DENHAM t was obviously a terrible misunderstanding."
ann,"It's just that, I haven't been paid in a while ..."
denham,"mock sincerity) That's awful. Anyway, Ann - may I call you Ann?"
ann,What type of person are you?
denham,"I'm someone you can trust, Ann. I'm a movie producer.  Believe me, I am on the level, no funny business. Please, sit down - Please ... Please."
ann,You're filming in the Far East?
denham,Singapore. On board ship he meets a mysterious girl. She's beautiful ... she's fragile ... haunted ...
ann,She falls in love.
denham,Yes!
ann,But she doesn't trust it. She's not even sure if she believes in love.
denham,Oh really?
ann,If she loves someone - it's doomed.
denham,Why is that?
ann,"Good things never last, Mr. Denham."
denham,So you're interested?
ann,Well I really -
denham,"Ann? I'm telling you, You're perfect - look at you! You're the saddest girl I ever met ... you're gonna make `em weep, Ann - you're gonna break their hearts!"
ann,"See, that's where you're wrong, Mr. Denham, I make people laugh, that's what I do."
denham, Ann! Miss Darrow! Please!
18.,"I'm offering NHAM DE you money, adventure, fame ... the thrill of a lifetime and a long sea voyage. You wanna read a script? Jack Driscoll's turning in a draft as we speak."
ann,Jack Driscoll?
denham,ure. Why - wait! You know him?
ann,"Well, no - not personally. I've seen his plays."
denham,"What a writer, huh? And let me tell you Ann, Jack Driscoll doesn't want just anyone starring in this picture. He said to me, ""Carl, somewhere out there is a woman born to play this role ...""  And as soon as I saw you, I knew -"
ann, Knew what?
denham,It was always going to be you.
ann, Is this the moving picture ship?
denham,Not exactly ... it's actually this one over here.

denham,"Yes - to MIKE and HERB) Get it on board, fellas. Come on. A NGLE ON: PRESTON hurrying down the GANGWAY. He rushes up to DENHAM ... his eyes flick to ANN, but he pulls DENHAM to one side."
preston, They're on their way. I've just had word.
denham,Who?
preston, Men in uniform. The studio called the cops!
denham,"Englehorn! Cast off! Hoist up the mainsail - raise the anchor, whatever the hell it is you do - we gotta leave."
englehorn,I cannot do that ... we're waiting on the manifest.
denham,What? Who? English - please!
englehorn," Paperwork, Mr. Denham."
denham, I'll give you another thousand to leave right now.
englehorn,You haven't given me the first thousand yet.

englehorn,Ma'am...
ann,Ann Darrow.
englehorn,"So you are ready for this voyage, Miss Darrow?"
ann,Sure...
englehorn,Nervous?
ann,Nervous - no. Why? Should I be?
englehorn,It isn't every woman who would take such a risk.
preston, Why don't I show Miss Darrow to her cabin?
denham,"Wonderful idea, thank you, Preston."
preston,"Miss Darrow, if you'd just - Hi, my name is Preston, Carl's assistant."
denham,Two thousand - it's a deal ... Will you take a cheque?
englehorn,Do I have a choice? E
preston,"Please, follow me. If there's anything that you need ... `excuse me fellas, if there's anything that you need please don't hesitate to ... ask ..."

denham,I'm supposed to be making a feature length picture.
jack,You told me I had more time. I'm sorry. Look I gotta go.
denham,Jack - No - you can't do this to me! I have a beginning but I need a middle and an end! I gotta have something to shoot.

bruce," Appreciate the help, fella."
preston,Let me get the door for you - welcome to your state room sir.
reston,"know, that's not a nice smell is it? I'm sure it'll disperse in a day or two. Did I ever mention how much I love your work, Mr. Baxter? I've seen every one of your pictures ... even the silent ones."
ruce,I haven't made any silent ones.
englehorn,"Dead slow ahead both, Mr Hayes."
hayes,"Dead slow ahead both, Captain."
jack,Oh Christ!
denham,"I keep telling you, Jack, there's no money in theatre."
sleazy investor,"No, no, no!"
denham,You're much better off sticking with film.
jack,"I don't do it for the money, Carl. I happen to love the theatre."
denham,"o, you don't."
preston," I hope you find it to your liking... it's quite comfortable. Your towels and linens are underneath the bed. That is the wash basin. I know, that's not a pleasant smell - is it? I'm sure it'll disperse in a day or two."
denham,Knock knock! We can't have our leading lady deprived of the necessities of life. to PRESTON) Do me a favour - run a bottle down to Jack. It'll fend off his migraine.
preston,They're still trying to find a place for him to sleep.
denham, You told him my typewriter is available for hire?
reston,Yes - he didn't take it well.
ann, Mr. Driscoll ...?
denham,Jack has his heart set on coming. Call me a softie - I couldn't say no.
choy,"This room very comfortable, plenty dim light ... fresh straw."
jack,What'd you keep down here?
choy,"Lion, tiger, hippo - you name it."
choy,Zoos ... circus ...  Careful! Camel have bad accident on floor. Stain unremovable ...
jack, Spoilt for choice.
englehorn,"What are you, Mr. Driscoll, a lion or a chimpanzee?"
jack,"Maybe, I'll take this one."
choy," Sorry, Skipper! Lumpy said -"
englehorn, Lumpy doesn't give the orders. What are you trying to do? Put the whole ship to sleep? Get them out of here!
jimmy,Compliments of the chef -
jimmy,Lambs brains in walnut sauce.
jimmy,"Doing it now, Mr. Hayes."
hayes,How about you return Mr. Driscoll's pen first?
ack,"No, it's okay."
hayes,"It's just he likes it down here, it's where I found him ... four years ago ... stowed away in one of them cages. His arm was broken in two places, he was wilder than half the animals in here. Still won't tell me where he came from - all I know, it wasn't any place good."
hayes,You gotta straighten up. You don't want to be on this ship for the rest of your life.
jimmy,I do.
hayes,"No, you don't, Jimmy. You wanna get yourself educated. Give yourself some options. Take this serious."
jimmy,"I do, Mr. Hayes, I do! Look, I've been readin'."
hayes,Where did you get this?
jimmy, I borrowed it ...
ann,It's nice to meet you Mr. Driscoll - I'm actually quite familiar with your work.  I've read everything you've ever written.
denham,"I don't care, Mike! You're the sound recordist - make it work."
herb,"Delighted to meet you, ma'am. And may I say what a lovely dress."
ann,Oh! This old thing! I just - threw it on!
preston, Isn't that one of Maureen's costumes?
ann, What does a girl have to do round here to get some breakfast!
denham,Lumpy! You heard the lady!
lumpy,Fancy some of me ... ah ... Porridge aux walnuts?
denham,"ANN, I don't believe you've met -"
ann,"That's alright Mr. Denham, I know who this is ..."
mike," Gee, thanks!"
ann,Actually - I am quite familiar with your work.
mike,Really?
ann,"Yes, and what I most admire - is the way you have captured the voice of the common people."
mike,Well - that's my job.
ann,"I'm sure you've heard this before, Mr Driscoll, if you don't mind me saying - you don't look at all like your photograph ... A NGLE ON: JACK at the bar, holding a cup of COFFEE. He turns and glances at ANN."
mike,Excuse me?
denham,Wait a minute! Ann -
ann, And much better looking.
denham,ANN! Stop! Stop - right there -
ann,I was afraid you might be one of those self obsessed literary types. You know - the tweedy twerp with his nose in a book and his head up his -
jack,"It's nice to meet you too, Miss Darrow.."
denham,"ait a second, we're killing off the First Mate?"
jack,That's assuming she knows who the First Mate is.
denham,"Come on, Jack! It was an honest mistake. Ann is near-sighted - it could happen to anyone."
jack,"I was joking, Carl."
denham,The point is: she's horrified. She has to look away. And that's when she sees it.
jack,See's what? What?
denham, The island.
jack, We're filming on an island now? When did this happen?
denham,"Jack, keep your voice down! I don't want the crew getting spooked."
jack,Why would they get spooked? What's it called?
denham,"All right ... It has a local name, but I'm warning you, Jack, it doesn't sound good."
jack,What's wrong with this place?
denham,There's nothing officially wrong with it. Because technically it hasn't been discovered yet.
jack, S ... k ... u ...
denham,"All right everyone, from the top.   And ... action!"
ann,I think this is awfully exciting! I've never been on a ship before.
bruce,I've never been on one with a woman before.
ann,"I guess you don't think much of women on ships, do you?"
bruce,"No, they're a nuisance."
denham, Cut! Great!
ruce,"hat do you think, Driscoll? The dialogue's got some flow now - huh?"
jack,It was pure effluence.
bruce,beefed up the banter ...
jack,Try to resist that impulse.
bruce,"It's just a little humor, Bud - what are you, a Bolshevik or something?"
jack,Actors. They travel the world but all they ever see is a mirror!
jack,Good legs.
ann,"I know, it wasn't what you wrote. But Mr Baxter felt very strongly that when a man likes a woman - then he must ignore her. And if things turn really hostile ... no?"
jack,Interesting theory.
ann,I know ... I should have -
jack,It wasn't what I had intended ... but it -
ann,I'm sorry - I was ...
jack,You made it your own ...
ann,I was nervous.
jack,"It was funny, actually ... you were funny."
ann,Please - don't say another word. Good night.
ack,Miss Darrow ...
denham,We're close. Head south-west.
englehorn,There's no land south-west for thousands of miles. It takes us way outside the shipping lanes.
denham,'ll make it worth your while.
englehorn,There's nothing out there.
denham,hen you've nothing to lose.
hayes,"If someone were to tell you this ship is headed for Singapore, what would you say?"
lumpy,"I would say they was full of it, Mr. Hayes. We turned south-west last night."
denham,"Gentlemen please, we're not looking for trouble -"
jimmy,No. You're looking for something else ...
denham," Yes .... we are. We're gonna find Skull Island! We're gonna find it, film it and show it to the world. For twenty five cents you get to see the last blank space on the map!"
lumpy,I wouldn't be so sure of that.
preston,What do you mean?
lumpy,"Seven years ago, me and Mr Hayes - we were working our passage on a Norwegian barque."
hayes,We picked up a castaway - found him in the water - he'd been drifting for days.
lumpy,"His ship had run aground on an island, way West of Sumatra. An island hidden in fog. He spoke of a huge wall, built so long ago - no one knew who had made it ... A wall a hundred foot high ... as strong today as it was, ages ago."
preston,Why did they build the wall?
lumpy,"The castaway - he spoke of a creature, neither beast nor man, but something monstrous, living behind that wall..."
denham,A lion or a tiger. A man-eater. That's how all these stories start.
preston, What else did he say?
lumpy,Nothing. We found him the next morning ... he'd stuck a knife through his heart.
denham,"orry fellas, you'll have to do better than that. Monsters belong in B movies!"
hayes,If you find this place -
hayes, How long do you expect us to stay out here?
ann, You're writing a stage comedy?
jack,I'm writing it for you.
ann,Why would you do that?
jack,Why would I write a play for you?
ann,Yes.
jack,Isn't it obvious?
ann,Not to me.
jack,"Well, it's in the sub-text."
ann,I guess I must've missed it.
jack,It's not about words ...
radio operator,"Message for you, Captain."
denham, What's going on?
denham,Hayes! Why are we turning around?
englehorn, Outside!
englehorn,There's a warrant out for your arrest. Did you know that? I've been ordered to divert to Rangoon.
denham,nother week - I haven't got a film yet. Please - I have risked everything I have on this!
englehorn,"No, Denham - you risked everything I have.     D DENHAM What do you want? Tell me what you want? I'll give you anything."
englehorn,I want you off my ship.
denham,"I'm finished. It's over for me, Jack."
jack,"How did you think this would end, Carl?"
hayes, Captain ...
englehorn,Check our position. Use the stars.
hayes," There are no stars, Captain."
jack,What is that?
denham, What?
jack,That.
denham,"I don't know ... what is it, a coffee stain?"
englehorn,"Station the for'head lookout, and get me the depth by lead-line!"
helmsman,"Aye, Captain."
crewman, Thirty fathoms ... no bottom!
englehorn,"Reduce speed, steerage way only."
hayes,"Dead slow ahead, both.  You should stop the ship."
englehorn,"15 degrees Port.  We're getting out of here, Mr. Hayes ... we'll find clear conditions."
crewman, Twenty-five fathoms!
hayes,We're shallowing!
englehorn,20 degrees starboard!
hayes," Captain, you don't know where the hell you're going!"
englehorn,Get me another reading!
hayes, Another reading!
crewman,Twenty-two fathoms!
englehorn,Douse the lights!
helmsman,"Aye, aye Captain ..."
crewman, Ten fathoms!
jimmy, Wall! There's a wall ahead!!!
englehorn,Stop engines!
englehorn,"Give me some power! Half astern, both!"
hayes,"Half astern, both, Captain!"
jack,Rocks!
jimmy, Rocks to starboard ... to port ... rocks everywhere!
englehorn,"Take the wheel, Hayes!"
englehorn,Full ahead!
hayes,"Rocks to port, Captain!"
englehorn,Hayes!
hayes,he's taken a pounding ...
englehorn,What about the prop?
hayes,"Shaft's not bent, far as we can tell, but she's stuck hard against the rock -"
jimmy,Captain! You'd better come up quick!
hayes,You want me to bring them back?
englehorn,I don't give a damn about Carl Denham ... I want this ship fixed and ready to float on the next high tide. We're leaving Mr. Hayes.
denham," Can you believe this, Jack? ... Skull Island! We got our picture!"
jimmy,"Why does Marlow keep going up the river, why doesn't he turn back?"
hayes,"shrugs) There's a part of him that wants to, Jimmy. A part, deep inside himself that sounds a warning, but there's another part, that needs to know ... that needs to defeat the thing which makes him afraid."
jimmy," It's not an adventure story - is it, Mr. Hayes."
hayes," No, Jimmy, it's not."
preston,It's deserted ...
ann, Mr Denham ... I think we should go back.
denham,will handle this.
jack,She doesn't want the chocolate!
denham,t's alright - it's just a bunch of women and old folks ... they're harmless.
ann,Mike?
englehorn,Seen enough?
englehorn, Lighten the ship! Anything that's not bolted down goes overboard!
denham,We got away. We gotta be grateful for that gentlemen.
preston,What about Mike? He didn't get away - he's still there!
denham, Mike died doing what he believed in! He didn't die for nothing. And I'll tell you something else - I'm going to finish this film - for Mike.
60.,I'm going to NHAM donate the DE finish it and proceeds to his wife and kids - because that man is a hero and he deserves nothing less!
herb,Hear! Hear!
jack,Where's Ann?
jimmy,She went to her cabin.
englehorn,"Wheel amidship ... Full ahead, both engines."
jack,Ann!
hayes,All hands going ashore ...
englehorn, What in God's name was that?
jack, Behind the wall!
jack, She's gone!
jack,She's gone!
englehorn,"You can take Hayes and fifteen others. I'll put a guard on the gate until you return ... The rest of you, stay with the ship."
hayes,"Not you, Jimmy."
jimmy,"Com'on Mr. Hayes, look at `em. None of them knows a which way to point a gun."
hayes,Stay here.
jimmy,Miss Darrow needs me!
hayes,No!
denham, Bring the tripod - and all of the film stock.
herb,You wanna go with the six inch lens?
denham,The wide angle will do just fine.
englehorn,"You got guns, you got food, you got ammo. You got twenty-four hours."
bruce,Twenty-four hours?
englehorn,This time tomorrow we haul anchor.
jack,Ann!
lumpy,Christ! It's a bleeding bone yard!  They've been ripped limb from limb.
jack, ANN! Ann!
jimmy,"Just keep walking, Mr. Hayes. Pretend you didn't see me."
hayes,"esus, Jimmy!"
jimmy,defiant) Hey! I need that!

hayes,Don't make me regret it.
hayes,growling) Conserve your ammunition!

jack,"Hey fellas - we don't have time for this. We've lost too much ground already! Come on, - get up!"
hayes, They're not about to quit on you. Cut them some slack.
denham, Over here. I wanna get a wide shot of the valley.
lumpy,Bloody Nora!
jimmy,Is that what took Miss Darrow?
lumpy, There's only one creature capable of leaving a footprint that size ...
hayes, It's gotta be - what? Twenty - twenty- five feet?
jack, Carl saw it. Let's ask him.
hayes,Denham! no answer) Where'd he go?
jack,Carl!!!
denham,"low) Walk forward, Bruce."
bruce,What?!
denham,You're the star of this picture! Get into character and head towards the animals.
bruce,"What the hell kind of place is this?  Are you sure about this, Denham??? Don't we have a stand-in for this type of thing?"
denham,"need you in the shot, or people will say they're fake."
bruce,Nobody's gonna think these are fake!
denham,ou're making them nervous! No sudden movement.
bruce,I'm not moving.

hayes,"Jimmy, do a head count. I wanna know how many injured and how bad -"
lumpy, Injured? Four of us are dead!
preston,It's not your fault. What happened to Herb - it's no ones fault.
denham," You're absolutely right, Preston ... And I'll tell you something else. Herbert didn't die for nothing. He died for what he believed in and I'm gonna honour that."
bruce, We gotta get back to the ship. Englehorn sails in nine hours.
jimmy,So? We gotta find Miss Darrow.
bruce,"Hey, did you hear me? We're gonna be stranded here!"
jack,I always knew you were nothing like the tough guy you play on screen - I just never figured you for a coward.
bruce,"Hey, pal, wake up. Heroes don't look like me - not in the real world. In the real world they've got bad teeth, a bald spot and a beer gut ... be seeing ya."
hayes,Anyone else?
ann, No! I said no!
hayes,"If anything happens, I want you to run! Understand?"
jimmy,I'm not a coward - I ain't gonna run.
hayes," It's not about being brave, Jimmy."

thelma,Then how does she know that it's real?

denham,"hank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Ladies and Gentlemen, I am here to tell you a very strange story ... a story of our adventure in which seventeen of our party suffered horrible deaths! Their lives lost in pursuit of a savage Beast, a monstrous aberration of nature! But even the meanest brute can be tamed. Yes, Ladies and Gentlemen, as you will see, the Beast was no match for the charms of a girl - a girl from New York ... who melted his heart. Bringing to mind that old Arabian proverb ..."
stage manager,"You're on, Miss Darrow, five minutes."
denham,"nd now Ladies & Gentlemen, I'm going to show you the greatest thing your eyes have ever beheld. He was a King in the world he knew but he comes to D         you now ... a captive!"
denham,"Don't be alarmed, ladies and gentlemen. It is perfectly safe. These chains are made of chrome steel!"
denham,"dramatic) Observe if you will, I am touching the beast! I am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.  DENHAM reaches up and touches KONG'S LEG. KONG'S foot twitches slightly causing DENHAM to jump back in fright ..."
preston, He was right ...
jack, That's the thing you come to learn about Carl ... his unfailing ability to destroy the things he loves.
denham,"lease remain calm, Ladies and Gentlemen - for we now come to the climax of this savage ritual ... the Sacrifice of a beautiful young girl!"
fake ann,"No! No! Help me, no!"
jack,Where is she??
jack, Where's Ann?
preston,I've no idea. I heard he offered her all kinds of money and she turned him down flat.
