Speaker,Dialogue
revised," December 4, 1986"
mike, Ellie!  C'mon!  Over here!
scotty, No joke?  You're being transferred to the 19th as your first assignment?  Who the hell loves your ass downtown?
rookie, What's the 21st?
scotty,What d'you care?  You'll never know.
brooklyn,"Manhattan.  The Upper East Side, East 59th to 96th."
scotty, Remember Curran from the Sixteenth? He posted a coupla months there on a floater outside the French embassy. He met Jackie Kennedy.
brooklyn,"Curran, that fuckin' noodlehead.  He probably wrote her up for letting her dog dump on Rockefeller's doorstep."
helen,Mmmmmm-glimmmeee-kisss!  I'm so proud of you!  What the hell took you so long?
mike,"Hey, don't ask me.  Ask the man who put in the good word."
mike,"If T.J. didn't push for me, I never would've made it."
brooklyn,"Bet your ass... I give you six weeks before you're back on the beat, Keegan, they got no room for hero cops..."
mike,"Appreciate, that vote of confidence, Brook."
brooklyn,"Hey, am I supportive, or what?"
helen,He left Elaine for that?
helen, I'd like to tie her tits together.
ellie,That wouldn't be too difficult.
mike," I bet you think she doesn't have a brain in her head.  I bet you think the only thing he sees in her is one incredible, dynamite body..."
helen,"I love your husband, Ellie, but he's a real dork."
ellie,"Yeah, but he's my dork."
mike, Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
ellie,Too kinky.
mike,"Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now."
ellie,Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
mike,"Take my advice, don't buy any..."
ellie,Mike?
mike, What?
ellie,My ass if falling.
mike,Your what...?
ellie,My ass is falling.  It is.
mike, What are you talking about?
ellie," I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore."
mike,Get in bed.
ellie,"What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity..."
mike,You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
ellie," Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?"
mike, You got no idea...
ellie,Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
win,Hi... nice to see you... thank you... my pleasure...
win,Glad I could be of help.
win,Claire!
claire,"Hello, Win."
claire, You know Neil Steinhart?
win,Of the filthy rich Steinharts?  Why is it Claire always connects with the richest men this side of Saudi?
neil, This gives new meaning to the word nightlife.
win,"C'mon, let's get outa this lowbrow rag trade...  You don't mind, do you?"
manager," I'm sorry, Mr. Venza..."
win,Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
claire,They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
win,And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
claire,You didn't like him?
win,Looks a little constipated to me.
claire," It's called ""solid""... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win."
win,The main floor stays public.  The side rooms we try to keep available for special functions like tonight.
claire,It's terrific Win.
win,You still writing the occasional magazine article?
claire,Occasionally.
win,"Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek."
win," Just press the button all the way down when you're ready, okay?"
neil,Where's she go?
win,Probably found somebody nicer... Kidding.  You're great.
win,"You're in overtime, Freddy."
claire,I will... I promise...
venza," You need money, you come to me."
venza," Who the fuck do you think you are, raising cash without coming to me?"
win," Your ex-partner... I'm buying you out, Joey.  Read the contract. There's ample provision."
venza,Fuck the contract!
venza, Two years ago you were begging me for the money.  Nobody would've touched you...
win,You're making an eighty percent return.  Which is what you wanted.
venza,Don't turn away when I'm talking to you.
win," Grease and water still don't mix, Joey."
win, Jesus Christ... are you crazy?
win,Joey!
win, Jesus...!
mike,T.J...?  Is this a joke?  Are you kidding me?  Give me 20 minutes.
ellie, Switch the light off on your way out.
mike," Right behind you, T.J."
garber,"Did you ever hear the chatter. They're worse than fuckin' four- year-olds... Miller, let's clear this path here, all right?"
garber," Blood bath downstairs.  The owner of this place is dead.  And I got a witness, and a suspect... Joey Venza."
garber,Nice question.  I like questions like that.
mike, Who's Joey Venza?
garber," Okay, let's find out what we know. Herd'm up and check'm out.  Anybody know more than gossip about the deceased or Venza, I wanna talk to them myself.  Go."
garber," Keegan, go baby-sit the witness. Just sit and look impressive.  Make her feel protected.  And if you can get her boyfriend outa my hair, I'll promote you to fuckin' Joint Chiefs..."
cop,"Quit playing with yourself, Keegan. I know who you are."
mike, A Detective's supposed to identify himself.
neil, Are you in charge here?
mike,"No, sir..."
neil,I asked for the man in charge...
mike,"That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs..."
neil,"Don't tell me he's ""busy"".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and..."
mike,Is she injured?
claire, No.
neil, You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
mike,"She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please."
neil,"No, I will not step outside."
mike,"Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave."
neil, I don't really see what that has to do with...
claire," Neil, do what he says."
claire, Please.
neil,I'll be right outside.
mike,Can I get you a cup of coffee or something?
claire, I've never seen anyone killed before.
mike,It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
mike,We'll go slow.  Okay?  We'll get through it together.
garber,"I don't know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it."
mike, I just sat and listened.
garber,Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.
garber,"Venza's either going to skip or try to get to her and Venza likes it here.  I want her ass covered, 24 hour protection, but I don't want her to know there is any real danger."
mike," I don't understand.  If there's any danger, why not just level with her..."
garber," T.J. your friend's a little dense. When she realizes there's a killer tryin' to shut her up, she'll be on the next plane for Tahiti... somehow I think my way is better."
mike,Chief?
mike,Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as good a job.
garber,"When I want your advise, Keegan, I'll make an appointment."
mike, I got a 'choice' at all.
mike,You in this with me?
mike, Tommy!  Goddamnit!  Get these skateboards off the goddamn kitchen floor!
tommy,What're we having?
mike,"My special, scrambled eggs surprise."
tommy, Scrambled eggs surprise?
ellie,So how'd it go?
mike,Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
ellie,For how long?
mike,'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
ellie,"Well, I'll live with it, I've lived with it all my life.  My Dad was a cop, he said, ""whatever you do, honey, never go out with a cop"". So, what did I do?  I got a job with the cops.  Then I married a cop.  I probably gave birth to a cop.  Tommy!  Come over here and eat, it's hot."
mike,Maybe you and Tommy should stay with my Mom.
mike,Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
ellie,I can still use a gun.
mike,"Just keep it someplace safe, but handy."
tommy, Keep what handy?
ellie,Nothing.
tommy,The gun?  It's in the upstairs closet.
mike,How do you know where the gun is?
tommy,I know where everything is.
mike,"Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things."
tommy,"Lay back, Mack."
mike,"Lay back, Mack!!  What's this ""lay back, Mack?""  Where does he get this?"
ellie,"Keep the weekends for us, huh?  Get a replacement for Saturday nights. That'll give us the weekends together."
tommy,God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
mike,"Just ""lay back, Mack""... lay back..."
garber, You remember Detective Keegan?
neil, I do.
neil,"I want to make sure that everyone respects the privacy of Miss Gregory's household.  You're limited to the outer vestibule, so you can watch the elevator, the kitchen, so you can get something to eat, and the washroom."
mike, Not Koontz.
garber," We'd like to, just once, get a look at the entire layout, so we can evaluate security."
claire,This really isn't necessary.  The security in this building is about the best in the city.
garber," I'm sure you're right, Miss Gregory, but I'd consider it a favor if you'd let us look around."
claire,Be my guest.
garber, Guys.
mike, What about when she goes out?
garber,"Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out."
mike, Pretty good.
neil,Why an I reminded of the Three Stooges?
mary, Just about everything you'd want will heat up by turning this to ninety seconds.
mike, Fuckin' A.
claire,Excuse me.
claire,"This is my dressing room, and these are my clothes.  I understand your responsibilities... but I'd appreciate you staying out of here at all times."
mike,Sorry.  Just checking.
claire,Straight ahead.
mike,Hard to find doors in this place.
claire,"... Detective Keegan, I hope you understand how upsetting this is?"
claire,"... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial..."
neil,Claire...
claire,... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
neil,"Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --"
claire,And I'm making mine.
neil," You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life..."
claire,"What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- ""let it go away""!!"
neil, Claire...
mike, I like 'em toasty.
mary,"Good night, Mr. Keegan."
neil,You're here 'til what time?
mike,I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
neil,"When you're through with it, put it back, please, exactly where you found it, and don't use the library again.  I have to leave town for a few days.  Let's do everything we can to make this less of a trial for her, shall we?"
mike,Hey!  What the hell're you doin' to my car?
ellie,Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
mike,I think television's a dangerous thing.
ellie,It's twenty bucks in the bank.
ellie,"Enough, Tommy!  C'mon.  Get out of there!"
mike,Hey.  The neighbors.
ellie,Let 'em eat their hearts out.
ellie,I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
mike," Well, actually, she looks better than that."
mike,I've got to go.
mike,See you Tommy.
mike,Okay?
ellie,Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
tommy,Nice threads Dad.
mike,"Yeah, I think so."
mike, Hi.
claire,I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
mike, Uh...
claire,"I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away."
mike," I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea..."
claire,"Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?"
mike,Right.  That's true.
claire,Can we go then?
mike,I'm supposed to call in.
claire,There's a phone in the car.
claire,Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
mike, Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
claire,What's the number?
garber,"Oh, Jesus, what a fucking lunatic. Fucking shopping.  I don't see that we have much choice.  Jesus Christ.  Tell her she's a fucking lunatic."
claire,What did he say?
mike,He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
claire,You live in Manhattan?
mike,Queens... You know Queens?
claire,My father founded a music school there.  The Milton Gregory School.
claire,I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
mike,Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
mike,Maybe not.
mike, Don't move it.
perfume lady,"Hello, Miss Gregory."
claire,Are you nervous?
mike,"No, Ma'am."
claire,"Would you wrap it for me, I'll be back in a moment."
claire,Could you come with me please.
claire,"Would you pick one out, please?"
mike,Beg pardon?
claire,"Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie."
salesperson,Perfect.
claire,"Put it on my account, please."
mike,I got money.
claire,If we had more time we'd work on the suit too.
claire,"You look quite elegant, actually."
mike,My wife likes this suit.
traffic cop," Bring it in, close."
cop,Jesus Christ.
mike,I'm on duty.
cop,What kind of work?  Gigolo?
claire,"You can touch me, I won't bite."
mike,Not too sure about that.
marge, CLAIRE!  Claire!  Darling!  Are you all right?
marge,"My God!  I couldn't believe... my poor darling... and Win Hockings...! Antonia'll be so happy you're here, she says a ""Lifetime Achievement Award"" is like being invited to your own funeral while you're still alive..."
antonia,Claire...!
claire,"I wouldn't have missed it, Tony."
antonia,You look so beautiful...
claire,"This is Mike Keegan, the policeman assigned to protect me.  Antonia Bolt..."
marge, Hello.
claire," Marge Woodwin, Antonia Bolt, this is Mike Keegan..."
mike, ... Ma'am.
antonia, And he blushes.  I like that.  Take good care of her.
mike,"Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman."
mike,Yes.
mike,... Hard?
mike,"Would you excuse me, please?"
mike,Would you consider leaving here pretty soon?
claire,People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
mike, Hey!  There are crazy people here.
claire,Let's get a drink.
mike,Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
claire,"I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee."
mike,I'll come with you.
claire,I think I can probably do that on my own.
mike," Gimme a spritzer, and a... vodka martini."
mike,Make it a double.
venza,"Christ, you're one beautiful woman. I could kill you right now, but I'm not gonna... 'cause you're gonna help me.  You're gonna see me in a police line-up and say it wasn't me. And if you don't do that, someone will come after you.  They're gonna find you dead, with your face missing -- understood... Good... Because otherwise, it'd be this easy."
venza,Now walk outta here.  And if you ever see me again... you never saw me before.
mike,Take care of her!
mike,Venza!
mike, But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
garber,You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
mike,It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
garber,Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
mike,Even Joey Venza?!
garber,"He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved ""good will"" by turning himself in."
mike, What about when she identifies him?!
garber,"If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him."
mike," It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!"
ellie,"The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?"
mike," Oh, some shit."
ellie,"What shit, honey?"
mike,You don't want to hear about it.
ellie,... Look at the fireplace.  You don't get workmanship like that anymore.
ellie,Ninety-seven five.  What do you think?
ellie,Honey.  You got him.
mike,"I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be."
ellie, She's got to identify him.
mike,Why?
ellie, Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
mike,I think -- she's crazy.
ellie,I'd identify him.
mike,I might stop you.
ellie,"Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?"
mike, No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
ellie,Where'd you get the tie?
mike, Bought it.
ellie,It's not your taste.
mike,What did she say the down payment was?
mike,"She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one."
ellie,She took you shopping for a tie?
mike,I had to follow her to a store.
ellie,What's wrong with your paisley tie?
mike,"Ellie, it was a formal party..."
ellie,Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
mike,"I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit..."
ellie,I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
mike,She bought it.
ellie,Why?
mike,I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
ellie," Next time you two go shopping, maybe you could tell her we need a new Maytag stackable, double-decker washer and dryer set."
ellie,You want to see the bedroom.
claire,Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
mike,You all right?
claire,Yeah.
mike,I'm sorry about what happened.
claire,"Listen, that was my fault."
mike," I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the ""can"" the way he did."
claire,"If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail."
claire,"Lieutenant Garber says when I identify him, they're going to lock him up and throw away the key."
claire,I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
mike," Sooner, the better."
claire,He said he'd kill me.
mike,Big talk... Desperate guy.
claire,Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
mike,It's the right thing to do. Identifying him.
mike,Claire?
claire,Hmm...
mike," You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?"
claire,Urdu and Hindi.
mike," Yeah, what a woman."
claire,"Didn't do very well, did you?"
mike, Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
claire,You were reading my Renoir.
mike,How did you know?
claire,You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
mike, They're kind of fuzzy.
claire,You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
mike,No kidding.
claire,"So, this could be your last night, huh?"
mike,"Could be, I guess."
claire," I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail..."
mike," Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow."
claire," You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?"
mike,Absolutely.  Look at this.
claire,That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
mike," No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out."
claire,"And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!"
mike, Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
claire,Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
mike,"... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act..."
claire,"So it was ""love""."
mike,Yeah.  It was.
claire,"And ""is""...?"
mike, Yeah.
claire,"That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?"
mike,No dog.
claire,"I saw you with a dog, in my mind."
mike,No dog.
claire,"But ""nice""."
mike,Very nice.
mike,What about Neil?
claire,"You don't like him, do you?"
mike, What's to like?
claire, Tell it like it is.
mike,You asked.
claire,"He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best."
mike,You could do better.
claire," I'll miss you, Mike..."
claire,"It was nice having you ""watch over me""..."
mike,Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
mike,Let's go home.
claire,"Good night, Mike."
mike,Sleep good.
neil,It's 3 o'clock in the morning. Where the hell have you been?
koontz,"I guess it happens, you know?  A chick gives you a ride in her limousine, the next thing she wants is to wear your clothes...  ... I heard he had her underpants on his head."
koontz,Ain't the first time the taxpayers paid for a blow-job neither.
garber, Let's get this over with...
koontz,"Okay, we're gonna have a line-up here..."
garber,"Good morning, Miss Gregory."
claire,"It was my fault not Detective Keegan's, I'm sorry for all the fuss."
garber, You all ready?
neil, Will this take long?
garber,We'll see.
garber,"They can't hear you, they can't see you...  Good luck."
koontz,"Okay, take a seat... you, put a couple phone books under your rear..."
ellie,Coming to bed?
mike,Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
ellie, Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
mike,I'll be right up.
neil,"They need me back in Miami, but I'd really like it if you could join me. The marlin fishing's supposed to be great off the Keys..."
neil,The change would do you a world of good.
tv newsman,"Denied bail, Joey Venza will remain behind bars at least until the time of the trial --"
neil,Hallelujah.
neil,At least now we can get on with our own lives.
mike,"Hey, not yet!  How many times..."
ellie,"God, it's freezin' out there."
mike, Ah!
tommy, Wait a sec.
ellie,Hello.  It's the Whip.
mike," Ah shit... Yeah, yeah, okay I'm on my way in."
ellie,What?
mike,"Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law."
ellie,"Mike, take it easy..."
mike,Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
ellie,"It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case."
mike, It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
ellie,Did you hear what I said?
mike,Did you hear what I said?!!
mike, I'm due on at seven.
tommy," We're not going to the game, are we Mom?"
ellie," Sure we are, let's go!"
koontz,She's a little upset.  You're going to have to piss in a bottle.
koontz," Sorry, I don't have any extras. Have a nice night."
claire, What do you want?
claire,I can't open it.
claire,You put me life in danger.
mike,"No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again..."
claire,"And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time!"
mike, Claire...?
mike,What are you doing?
claire,You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
mike,"Claire, will you calm down?"
claire,"I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park."
mike,Claire...!
mike,"Stop, will you?!"
claire, Let go!
mike,Stop being nuts!
claire, I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
mike,I do care about you!
claire,More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
mike, Easy... easy... I'm not gonna leave you alone like this...
mike,I'm not gonna let anything happen to you...
tommy, There's somebody outside...
scotty,"Calm down, everything is okay. Ellie reported a prowler.  Probably one of those peepers who've been making this neighborhood such a pleasure..."
scotty,We all look like hell.
brooklyn, I'll come 'round in the car from time to time so you can get some sleep.  Just keep the shades pulled.
brooklyn,Thanks for the coffee.
ellie, Thanks.  You're terrific.
ellie, I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
mike, I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
ellie,"Don't be ridiculous... That's all I need, rubbing up against your mother and grandmother every day... I can take care of myself...  C'mon, let's go to bed... we all need some sleep..."
ellie,"C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?"
mike,"D'you have to say ""fucking"" every other word?"
ellie,What was that?
mike,You heard me.
ellie,"Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap."
mike,What're you talking about --
ellie,"I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!"
mike,Fuck.  What's happening?
claire,Is everything all right?
mike,Yeah.
claire,They called here after you left...
mike, She's okay.  Everything's okay...
mike, I don't know you...
claire,"This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else..."
mike,You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
claire," Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it."
claire,Don't you think I know what this is doing.  I know you have a wife.  I know you have a family... I'm not asking for anything.  I don't want anything... Just please hold me I'm scared...
mike," All fucked up, T.J."
ellie,You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
mike,I'm sorry.
ellie,I'm not saying it's your fault.
mike,What did you do tonight?
ellie,I watched TV.
mike,What did you watch?
ellie,"I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me."
ellie,I'll make a reservation tomorrow for early dinner.  You can sleep till noon.
ellie,"Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you..."
mike,"Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon."
ellie," I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift."
mike,"Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it."
ellie," I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him..."
mike, You talked to his wife?
mike,My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
ellie,What's the difference?
ellie,Unless there's some particular reason why it feels better to be around her at night.
ellie,"Is there, Mike?"
ellie,"What, what is it?  Is it serious or what...?  Quit looking at me like that!  What's with this ridiculous silence?!"
ellie,Goddamn.  I never thought this would happen to me... you fuckin' sonofabitch...
ellie,"I just want you off the case.  Get off it, or don't come home.  The kind of ""lady"" you apparently prefer."
waiter, We got some specials.
mike, We'll be right back.
mike,Let me drive...
ellie,"Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me."
mike, And you are a lady.  I have so much respect...
ellie, You fucker!  Don't tell me how much respect you have!  You dumb mother fucking FUCKER!  Now get off this case or don't come home!!
mike,"Hey, T.J.?  Yeah, listen, I need a huge favor from you, man.  I know Helen doesn't like you to miss dinner, but I need you to switch shifts with me tonight.  Look, do it or don't do it, but spare me the fuckin' lecture, all right?"
doorman,I know sweetheart... we have enough flowers here.
doorman,"No, no, sweetheart... not here... get going... Okay."
vietnamese girl, Have a nice day.
claire,He's okay?
claire,Oh.
mike,"I just gotta talk to her, T.J."
mike,T.J. agreed to take my shift.  He knows about us.
mike, So does Ellie.
claire,You told her?
mike,Not exactly.
claire,What do you want to do?
mike,I don't know.
claire,You're tired.  Let me watch over you tonight...
mike,Put it down!  Think about it!
mike, Get on the floor!  There may be more!
mike, T.J.!
mike, T.J...!
mike,"Live, T.J.  Please...!"
mike, Get security on the phone! Emergency!
mike, Ambulance!  Ambulance!  He's got a heartbeat...!
mike, They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
garber, I heard.
garber,"I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?"
mike, It should've been me...
garber,"Then it would've been her, too.  I don't know... but I gotta protect the Precinct, too.  You're on suspension, pending Disciplinary Hearings.  Don't hold your breath. And you're not to go near that woman until she's no longer under Police protection and this case is closed."
garber,"Is it ""love,"" Mike?  I hope so.  I want it to be worth it, for your sake."
ellie,I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
mike,What about Tommy?
ellie,"He'll live through it.  They all live through it.  What a world, huh?"
ellie,Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
mike,No.
ellie, What a shame.
scotty,"You see a couple of the parties that go on at this place, you'll realize that marriage is an institution whose time has come and gone."
scotty,"Little Scotty stays on Wednesdays, and every other weekend.  And know what?  Our relationship's never been better."
scotty,"Make it home, Mike..."
neil, This is the rest of your life we're talking about.
claire,"I have thought it through, Neil."
neil,"Call me if anything changes.  I love you, Claire."
koontz,"Unbelievable, man, the fuckin' jogger... they found him in Atlantic City, totally drugged out and still jogging..."
claire,Hello?  Mike.  Where have you been?
mike,You don't want to know.
mike,"I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through."
mike, Are you okay?
claire," Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular ""marching band"".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --"
claire,"I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come..."
claire," I'm going away after that, the next morning."
mike,Where?
mike,When can I see you?
claire,I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
mike,Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
claire,Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
claire,"Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?"
claire,"No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really."
mike,Tommy!
mike,"How are things going, pal?"
tommy,"Okay, I guess."
mike,How about dinner tonight?
tommy, Mom and I got plans.
mike,"What ""plans?""  You and Mom got ""plans?"""
tommy, She's taking singing lessons.
mike, She's what?
tommy,She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
mike, What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
tommy, We're gonna pass the street.
tommy,You coming in?
mike,"No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a ""singing lesson"" than have dinner with your father..."
tommy,"We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons."
mike,"So, what are you doing tonight?"
tommy,Shooting.
mike,Shooting?
tommy,"Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood.  'Bye, Dad."
mike,Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
tommy," I don't think she can sing, either."
mike,"Take care, pal."
tommy,Aren't you supposed to aim at the head?
tommy," Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?"
ellie,I don't know Tommy.
tommy,"Hey, can we go to McDonald's?"
ellie,Absolutely.
giddings,"Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came."
claire,It was something my father always liked me to do.
giddings, You're planning to speak?
claire,Not if you don't want me to.
giddings," Well, of course, we'd be... honored..."
claire, Just putting in an appearance then.
koontz," Don't do it, man.  I love ya, but you're out of your mind."
claire, What a memory.
mike,Do you dance?
claire,Do you?
mike,Pretty bad.
claire,Let's do it.
mike,They guys treatin' you all right?
claire, Yeah.
mike,I've been doing a lot of thinking.
claire, I know.
mike,It wouldn't work.
claire,I know.
mike,I'd miss my life...
claire,... Don't explain.
mike,How long you going away for?
claire,Long enough.
mike,"""For""...?"
claire,"""To""... Forget about you."
claire,I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
mike, Yeah...
koontz,Brook's patching a call through to you.  He thought he'd find you here. It sounds urgent.
koontz,He says it's your son.
koontz, The office down the hall.
mike, No.  Nobody but me.
venza,"I'm glad you're where I expected you to be, Detective Keegan, 'cause you're got two minutes to get home or I take your family out."
mike, Hello?
mike, I need you guys.
mike,Venza.
mike,At my house...!
koontz, Call a cruiser!
claire,... Mike.
mike," It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy."
koontz, Move it!  Get the cars!
mike, Koontz!  I need you guys!
koontz,We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the locals.  Throw it!
mike," No, I need'm now!"
claire, Go with him!
koontz,My job is to protect you!  This is Koontz --
mike," No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!"
koontz,"I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him."
claire,Mike!  Don't go there...!  Then make them come with you!
mike,"They can't, they're assigned to you!  I'd do the same thing!"
koontz, Go get her.
koontz," Fuck it, man.  Our brother needs us. Let's go."
mike, Go!  Get outta here!
mike,Get OUT!
claire,"They're assigned to me, they'll have to go if I come with you!"
claire, I'm not getting out!  GO!
koontz," Adams...!  C'mon, move it!"
mike,Turn off the siren...!
mike," We get there, you get down, stay out of sight.  Don't get near that house.  Understand me?  Venza's not to know you're there!"
mike,Tommy?  Ellie...?
mike, I'm not armed!  I'm the only one in here!  I can help you get away if you listen to what I say!
mike,"I'm comin' in the kitchen!  If you fuckin' shoot me, they'll come in here, and we're all dead!  You hear me, Venza?!"
venza,"You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said."
mike, Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
venza,You should'a brought the girl.
mike,I brought the girl.  She's outside.
venza,Hold it...!
mike,I'll prove it!
mike,Claire!
koontz, Not another word until I tell you.
venza,How do I know that's her?
mike,"I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in."
venza, Why should she come in?
mike,She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
venza,Bullshit!  Prove it.
mike," You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!"
mike,I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
venza,I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
mike,Let my kid go.
venza,I'm not lettin' no one go.
mike,"Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!"
venza,Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
mike,Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in.
venza, Under the table.
mike,"I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head."
ellie,"Be careful, Tommy."
mike, Claire!  It's dark.  Watch your step.  Come slowly.
mike,Watch your step!
venza, What the fuck you doin'?!
mike,There's a skateboard in the door!
ellie, Stay down!
mike,"Turn around, fuck!"
ellie, Tommy...!
tommy,I'm all right.
mike,Ellie...
ellie,I'm all right.
koontz," Fuckin' miracle, man."
koontz, Told you they'd be here in a few minutes.
claire,Everyone's all right...?
mike,Yeah.  It's all over.
mike,So.
claire,So.
mike,You still going away?
claire,I don't know...
mike,"You don't have to, now."
claire,I think it's probably still a good idea.
mike,Yeah...
claire," I'll miss you, Mike."
mike,"Listen, I'll... see you again."
claire, Say goodbye.
mike,I like your coat.
claire, You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
mike,I do.
claire,"Say goodbye, Mike."
mike, You take care.
mike," Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this."
garber, Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
mike,"Good police work, kiddo."
ellie, Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
mike,Me neither.
mike,Let's find some place to start over.
