Speaker,Dialogue
for educational,"PURPOSES ONLY  Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Dylan Thomas"
man,"lies on a couch near the window. He stands up suddenly and looks out the window. AL STUMP, 40, is sharply dressed -- tie, dress shirt, cufflinks. He's staring at something."
stump,"Yes! The muse has left me stranded here like a beached whale -- only one phrase, one word, from finishing the greatest essay I've ever written! One word, the right word -- Flaubert called it 'le mot juste' -- I ever tell you that? Lucille is a longsuffering saint. LUCILLE 'Le mot juste' -- the exact right word the writer needs to tell his story. Yessir, you've mentioned it. STUMP Hemingway, Faulkner, Joyce -- they all searched for 'le mot juste' until they cried, until they bled... LUCILLE Yessir. STUMP What is this essay about again?"
lucille,Fishing.
stump,"I mean what is it really about? LUCILLE You said it was about the quote unquote primal issues of survival, man against nature, etcetera -- that's what you said."
stump,Ohyeah... so... we end the essay with... 
stump, ... 'frozen in'...
stump,"I need a drink. LUCILLE What about 'le mot juste,' Mr. Stump? STUMP  Fuck 'le mot juste,' Lucille! Finish the damn thing yourself. 'The primeval moment is frozen in' whatever the hell you want it to be. Did you know that James Joyce let his secretary -- none other than Samuel Beckett -- revise and edit Molly's solliloquy in Ulysses? You're my Beckett -- I give you 'le mot juste!' Just get the damn thing in the mail so I can get paid."
stump,"I don't know.    I need a drink. He grabs his hat and coat and we begin hearing the number one hit song of 1960, PERCY FAITH'S schmaltzy recording of ""A Summer Place."" CUT TO:"
stump,"Awright, awright... how do you get five old ladies to say 'fuck?' CRONIES  Jeez, I dunno, how? Etc... STUMP Yell 'bingo.' Stump laughs. The others groan. REYNALDO, 40's, black, speaks up. He's one of the regulars."
reynaldo,"Okay, I got one -- "
frank,"Amidst this levity, gentlemen, I have some real concerns. Mark my words, people will look back on this year and say that 1960 was the year that Western Civilization began its downward trajectory. BILL You need to get laid, Frank. FRANK Guys, guys, c'mon... do you really think things are as good as they used to be? You think Jack Kennedy is qualified to be President? BILL Kennedy may not be qualified, but -- Jackie's a babe -- and that's good enough for me. REYNALDO They're a happily married couple and that oughta stand for something these days..."
mud,"Speaking of being happily married, Al, are you and your old lady still having problems?"
frank,I mean look at us -- we call ourselves writers but we just watch ballgames and get drunk a lot. You call that writing? STUMP Yes I do.
mud,"In the department store of life, sports is the toy department -- so what? BILL Yeah, besides, Alan here's writing a serious novel, aren't ya? MUD Yeah, well I haven't started yet but I'm gonna. I've been busy. FRANK You guys are pathetic. Ya write for one reason -- a paycheck."
stump,"More art was created for money than for passion. Take your platitudes and shove 'em, Frank. I'm gonna write a novel too, someday."
frank," The Great American Novel, I suppose?"
stump,"It could come from my pen. FRANK You're a barbershop writer, Al -- you write sugar-coated pieces for guys to skim when they're waiting for a haircut!"
mud,"Hey! A scuffle breaks out, a lot of posturing, feinting, but they're all too chicken to do anything. Nobody wants to fight. A PHONE RINGS at the bar. The bartender answers the phone, shouts at the obnoxious sportwriters."
reynaldo,"Stump!   For you. Stump goes to the phone, interrupting his own ""fight."" STUMP  Shut up!"
mud,Cobb who? STUMP Ty Cobb!    How many Cobbs are there?! This news instantly sobers the room.
stump,Not yet. He said he wants to tell me the real story of his life before he croaks.
bill,You were just talking to Ty Cobb?
stump,The Georgia Peach himself. This impresses the hell out of everyone in the room.           Even Stump is still a little dazed.
frank,"They say Cobb is crazy. The meanest sonofabitch who ever lived. MUD I heard he killed a man. BILL Maybe so, but -- he was the greatest baseball player of them all. CRONIES Yeah, the best, no one close, etc..."
stump,Except Ivan was a nicer guy... 
stump,Immediately.
stump,Shit...
jonah,It's just starting. We got three- four feet of snow another thousand feet up. Where ya going? Skiing? I hate skiing.
jonah,"Cobb?! He stopped here for gas once, I asked him for an autograph for my boy and he told me to shove it where the sun don't shine. STUMP I hear he's got a way with kids..."
stump,I'm a writer.
willie,You mean he actually found somebody to take the job?
stump,"Mr. Cobb? The silence is shattered by a SCRATCH, then VIOLIN MUSIC from upstairs. STATIC suggests a record is playing."
stump,Thank you.
cobb,But you are a hopeless romantic and only a moderate success.
stump,"Sir, I am the most successful sportswriter in America and not merely a 'moderate success.'"
cobb,Of course.  Give me those pills over there.
stump, A few weeks.
cobb,"All the great ones will be there -- The great Mickey Cochrane will be there! Hornsby, Sisler, Ott, the Waner Brothers... we used to have some parties, Stump, I'll tell ya that right now...  We can't forget. STUMP I won't forget."
cobb,"Look at me closely, Al...  You're gonna tell the real story of Ty Cobb. STUMP What's the 'real' story? Cobb climbs slowly out of bed.     His words are reasoned and not without passion."
cobb,That's why you're here. 
cobb,"Getty is expanding in the west, looking for companies like that. I got a hunch...  Stumpy, c'mere... Cobb picks up the revolver and holds it lovingly. Stump crosses and stands behind Cobb, sharing the view. COBB I can take that buck.     What'ya think? STUMP With a pistol? No way. Cobb smiles and loads the revolver.       He pushes the window which swings slowly open."
cobb, ... and sell all the 3-M stock we got.
jameson,"If Mr. Cobb said he got him, then he got him."
cobb,"You have no vision, Stump. A writer without vision is a waste of my time. I think I picked the wrong man. Cobb stumbles back into bed, somewhat exhausted by the ordeal."
jameson,"And I think I better get back to San Francisco before the storm hits. I'll take care of these transactions, Mr. Cobb. And Jameson exits the room."
cobb," Yes. Cobb reaches over and defiantly turns UP the MUSIC so that the room is overwhelmed with Kreisler's violin. Stump stares back at this decrepit, overpowering figure."
cobb,"Chapter one, Page one..."
stump,"I'm ready. COBB 'Know ye that a prince and a great man has fallen this day.' Stump types it out, then stops."
stump,What the hell is that? COBB That's what Robert E. Lee said at the burial of my grandfather who was a Confederate General killed at Fredricksburg.
stump,So I'm taking notes? COBB Hell no. That's the first line of my autobiography. STUMP I ain't writing it.
cobb,Why not?
stump,It's horseshit. It's a third person comment about someone who's already dead. An autobiography has to be in the first person -- plus it can't come from the other side of the God damn grave.
cobb,My story can come from any damn place I want. STUMP Not to mention you can't call yourself 'a prince and great man' -- that's for the world to decide.
stump,You're not treating me like a writer -- you're treating me like a stenographer.
stump,"Know ye that a prince and a great man has fallen this day... COBB It has a certain ring to it... STUMP Yes it does. COBB I thought you might like it. It's yours, a gift from me.  This is the second line from what will be the greatest biography of a great man ever written -- type it! Cobb checks the tape and suddenly is deep in thought over some information coming across. Stump types."
cobb,Bethlehem Steel's about to dive.
cobb,Yeah... buy Coca-Cola. We're about to go out in cans.
stump,"Coke in cans?    I don't think so. Cobb just stares back in disdain.      Then, suddenly --"
cobb,You know what's wrong with Ty Cobb? STUMP What? COBB  My heart leaks -- the doctors who are nothin' but a buncha hacksaw artists give me Digoxin to keep it pumping... Cobb grabs a bottle of Digoxin pills and flings it across the room in a rage. He flings bottles of pills as he recites his ailments.
cobb,"They give me Darvon for the cancer in my back, they give me Tace for something eatin' up my stomach, Fleets Compound for an infection in my bowels, Librium for my tension, insulin for my diabetes..."
cobb,"And if all that wasn't enough, it's been two years since I got my pecker in the air...  The South may not rise again but my dick will."
cobb,Tell him to go to hell anyway. STUMP Why?
cobb,Him and me used to be pals but we went on a hunting trip once and he hired a shitty guide.
cobb,You tell him to go fuck himself or I'll kick your Yankee ass!
cobb,"It'll pass...  Stumpy, listen to me -- you know what I need?"
stump,What do you need? COBB I need a woman.  A woman is definitely what I need...
stump,There's a blizzard out there!
cobb,"When a man wants a woman, a man wants a woman. "
cobb,"You lead, I'll follow. STUMP I'm not driving in this stuff! COBB I need a woman! CUT TO:"
cobb,"You call that driving, Alice?! My sister can drive faster than that! Step on it! "
cobb, The man drives like an old woman...
cobb,"Drive, motherfucker, drive!"
stump,struggles to see through the windshield -- snow is swirling everywhere.
stump's pov,"Cobb's car disappears into the blizzard, fishtailing as it goes."
cobb,It's about fucking time you got here! STUMP You've alive?
stump,"There's blood! COBB Of course there's blood! I just put my head through the windshield of a car, what the hell ya think, ya big fucking jerk."
stump,Shut up! COBB Ty Cobb can't die like this! They'll bury me and nobody'll know who it is!
stump,"I said shut up. Stump drags Cobb awkwardly through the snowbank back up to the highway. When they get to the edge of the high- way, Cobb stops to stare at the tire tracks leaving the road. COBB Look't that! No guard rail! I'm suing the State Highway Commission, I'm suing the Governor, I'm suing every God damn body!  I coulda been killed! STUMP God damn it, shut up and get in the car! The blizzard swirls around the two men, now at Stump's car on the highway."
cobb,"Gimme your keys, I'm driving."
stump,I'm driving. 
cobb,Now give me the keys.   I'm driving.
cobb,It's only another hour -- plenty of time to tell you my story before we find us some women.
stump,Women?   Plural?
cobb,"Some for you, some for me. We'll have a helluva time. The broads're probably lining up right now, waiting for ol' Ty and his buddy Stump. STUMP  Dear God... And Cobb launches in as he accelerates down the mountain, every curve risking death. He seems at peace with the world -- in the driver's seat, literally, on the edge of being utterly out of control. COBB I suppose you want to know about my childhood. Writers usually do. STUMP None of this 'know ye that a prince and great man has fallen' stuff -- COBB My philosophy is simply this   -- Life is too short to be diplomatic. A man's friends shouldn't mind what he does  or says, and those who are not  his friends, well, to hell with  'em. And Cobb drifts into a story of his youth. He's suddenly so relaxed that he pays little attention to the road."
cobb,"I was born in a small town in Georgia, of course... my sweet sister Florence still lives there... "
new angle,"Closer and closer the engine comes -- 50 yards, 25 yards, 10, five, four, three... moments before death -- Young Ty Cobb leaps to safety, flying in front of the engine, out over the water till he splashes, mere milli- seconds before he would have been crushed to death.  Young Cobb surfaces in the river and waves his arms in triumph. His pals shriek with delight and embrace him at his courage.  COBB  I felt protected. By my father, my mother, the baptism, I don't know -- but from that moment on I knew I couldn't be hurt."
cobb,Then you've read that I'm the meanest bastard of them all?
stump,"People have said that, yes..."
cobb,I don't care what people think. STUMP Then why do you care what I write?
cobb,I am who I tell you I am!   Why are you making things so complicated?!
stump,That's what writers do.
cobb,"My father was murdered, y'know. STUMP Your father was murdered? COBB I mean that's the sort of thing you're looking for, isn't it?  Murdered on the balcony of his own house... the house I grew up in..."
cobb,Why I'm such a prick? Ha!  That's too easy -- you're a better writer than that -- STUMP Was the killer ever caught?
cobb,"There was an arrest, a trial, and an acquittal. Nobody was ever convicted."
stump,Jesus Christ --
cobb,"Single to left, steal second, steal third, steal home... GAMBLER Eight to one. COBB Fuck you!"
gambler,Ten to one.
cobb,"You're on. Cobb tosses some money on the pile, and climbs up the dugout steps, shouting. CUT TO:"
cobb,"Hey, greaseball, check your wife -- one of the players is missing! "
cobb,Who the hell ever signed you? TEAMMATE Go to hell.
cobb,"Hey, Cyclops, you're missing a good game. UMPIRE Shut up, Cobb. As Cobb digs in, he reaches into his back pocket and drops something on home plate, in front of the CATCHER. COBB Here ya go... The Catcher holds up a pair of women's panties. COBB Your old lady left 'em in my car last night -- I thought you could give 'em back to her."
cobb,You God damn coward! You shoulda thrown at me again! You shoulda hit me in the fucking head! 
cobb,"Hey, Krauthead, I'm coming down."
new angle,"The pitcher stretches, looks and delivers -- and Cobb breaks for second. The pitch is wide. The Catcher fires.  Wagner takes the throw as Cobb arrives in a spikes-up slide. And Wagner swipes a brutal tag in Cobb's face -- his giant ham of a hand in the tiny glove clutching the ball lashes across Cobb's mouth. Blood gushes. The ball pops free. Wagner seems unbothered by the fact that Cobb is safe at second -- he has bloodied Cobb's face. Cobb seems unboth- ered by the fact that his face is a bloody mess -- he has stolen second. Both men seem satisfied."
pitcher,Stretches and delivers -- Cobb takes off for third.       The throw is high -- he slides in safely.
catcher,steals a glance at Cobb who takes a menacing lead off third. The Catcher gives a signal to the pitcher.
cobb,"A good day to you, too, sir... The police escort Cobb to right field -- the roar of the vitriolic crowd increases. COBB  Do you know what it's like to be booed like that?"
cobb,"After World War Two, General Patton asked me for an autograph -- he said he patterned himself after me!  Are you getting this?"
stump,I'll remember. COBB Why aren't you writing?!
stump,"'Cause I'm trying to have a good grip on things when this car goes over the next cliff! I ain't ready to die yet! Cobb's tone changes suddenly -- he questions Stump with- out guile or anger, as if his answer is obvious. COBB But neither am I."
stump,Ty!
cobb,But you're not listening to me! I may have every God damn disease known to man but I am never going to check into a hospital because I am alive and I am going to get laid in Reno! 
cobb,You queer?!
stump,I'm married. COBB I thought you were divorced.
stump,"We're in the middle of a... problem. We're talking. COBB Talking my ass! Quit hanging on -- get a divorce. Is that why you don't wanta get laid in Reno? 'Cause you're feeling loyal to a woman you're divorcing? That's really stupid, Stumpy..."
stump,I'm not getting a divorce.    I'm being loyal. COBB Is that why you used to wine and dine that little brunette who had an office across the courtyard from you in Santa Barbara? Stump is nailed.
stump,"What do you know about her?! COBB I do my homework, Stumpy. I know where the bodies are buried. STUMP  It didn't last long!"
stump,"Nobody knows about the brunette. COBB Our little secret, huh?  And that part about me being a shit with women? That ain't gonna be in the book."
stump,I gotta put your family in my book. COBB Your book?! My book! And nothing about my ex-wives or children are gonna be in it. My book is about baseball! STUMP My book is about Cobb!
cobb,Cobb is baseball! INTERCUT:
stump,Ty!    Look!   It's a man!
cobb,Whoever it is he's gotta be pretty stupid to be out in this shit. STUMP We're out in this shit! And Stump climbs out of the car.
stump,Let me help you to the car. WILLIE I told you that you'd only last one day with the bastard. STUMP Cobb's in the car. He's driving.
stump,Yeah...
willie, He hates me. He hates black people...
stump,"He fucking hates everybody. Don't give him the pleasure of dying out here. WILLIE If dying out here gives him pleasure then I won't die out here. They get to the car -- Stump opens the back door to help the nearly-frozen man into the car. Cobb grumbles. STUMP Ty, it's Willie. We can give him a lift to town."
cobb,Bullshit! I ain't givin' no nigger a ride nowhere!
stump,Shut the fuck up and give him a ride!
cobb,Now who's the coward! You won't shoot me! You need me! Stump hands the gun to Willie..... 
cobb,"You'll pay for this, Stumpy... STUMP Say, Willie, you a baseball fan? WILLIE Yessir..."
stump,"Who's the greatest ballplayer of all time, in your opinion? WILLIE Willie Mays, no doubt about it. COBB That nigger couldn't hold my jock! STUMP Excuse me, Mr. Cobb, the man is speaking..."
cobb,Shut up!!
willie,"And of course, the greatest base runner of all time isn't riding in this car -- the fastest baseball player of all time was Cool Papa Bell -- Cool Papa would've easily broke all your stolen base records -- "
willie,"Cool Papa   was so fast that when he entered a   hotel room and flipped the light   switch off, he'd be asleep in   bed before it got dark... STUMP And then there's Satchel Paige... WILLIE Oh yeah, Satchel Paige could throw a porkchop past a wolf, Mr. Cobb, ol' Satchel woulda had you eatin' outta his hand, he woulda had you hittin' .220 and kissin' his black ass to boot... COBB Shut this man up!"
willie,"The man with the gun does the talking, you wretched, old prick..."
stump,Ice!   Slow down! Tyyyy!
willie,"Well, Mr. Cobb, thank you for a lift into town... Willie hands the gun to Stump and climbs out of the car, bidding farewell to Stump as he does."
stump,"Two rooms, please..."
clerk,"Aw, c'mon, you always want a discount, Mona."
ramona,We're all sick in the eyes of God -- but some of us still have manners.
stump,"Your gun's okay, too... right here..."
stump,"Mine, for crissakes, I'm the writer!"
cobb,But I'm the legend and legends are not pathetic!
stump, These are just notes...
cobb,Don't you understand anything about 'greatness'? STUMP Maybe you should find another writer. COBB There's not enough time left. This frank admission momentarily stops Stump. STUMP I'm entitled to my opinions -- COBB Now that's pathetic. Who gives a good God damn about the opinions of Al Stump?! What people want to know about is Ty Cobb! And they don't want to know who he hates 'cause everybody hates somebody! They don't wanta know if he had two wives or ten! They don't wanta know if he hit women or if they hit him! STUMP You think they wanta know how to steal second base?
cobb,Yes!   Precisely!
stump,Well I don't! 
cobb,And you ain't printing it. STUMP I have to. COBB Not if I say so. I don't think you understand something -- I have final editorial approval of the book.
stump,"No, I do.    I always have it. COBB Did you read your contract?"
stump,It's my standard contract. I just signed. I would never have agreed to this if you had final approval.
cobb,Call your agent. Stump quickly dials and gets an answer.
stump,Hello? Charlie? Al... I'm in Reno... yeah... things are fine...  We did? Cobb has it? Jesus... Stump listens long and hard -- his face sinks. Cobb smiles and hangs the phone back up for Stump who reaches for the bottle on the nightstand and pours himself a morning drink of vodka.
cobb,"Well, you were pretty stupid to give up approval, weren't ya? STUMP Fuck you, Cobb? COBB Fuck me? Why me?  Why you mad at me? Your agent made the deal, your lawyer, your publisher, you didn't even read the contract because you trusted them! Who the hell ever trusted a lawyer or an agent?! If I was Al Stump, the guy I'd be pissed off at would be Al Stump! STUMP Listen to me, you son of a bitch -- if you die before the book is finished, I'll write the story I want. COBB But I ain't dying first."
stump,I'll write slow.
cobb,Now get dressed so we can go find some women... Stump just stares back -- exhausted and overmatched.
cobb,I don't remember... Ramona arrives at their table.
ramona,"Cigarettes, gentlemen? Cigars? We stockpiled some Havanas before Senor Castro did his little number."
stump,"At the hotel -- checking in. RAMONA Ohyeah, you were the asshole. Cobb is suddenly gallant, gentlemanly, even charming."
cobb,"Excuse me, young lady, I must apologize for the behavior of my friend -- he has a crude side. Ramona delivers the cigars and collects the money. Stump is a bit chagrined and caught off guard by this Cobb."
ramona,I accept. COBB Ramona... Spanish name... lovely... it means 'moonlit garden of the gods'... RAMONA Actually it's German and means 'wise protectoress' but thanks for the thought...
louis prima,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, you're a great crowd ... I have been informed that we have a celebrity with us tonight who is a legend, a man who truly needs no introduction... "
cobb,"Of course they want me. And Cobb heads for the stage, walking better but not without effort, a walk enhanced by drugs and booze. As he does, Ramona turns to Stump. "
stump,The greatest baseball player of all time.
ramona,I don't know baseball from shmaseball but I know a nice man when I see one and I also know it's time for my coffee break. Hasta luego. And she's off with her trayful of tobacco to the cocktail lounge.
back onstage,"As Cobb arrives... LOUIS PRIMA AND GROUP  Fellas, she can't get, are fellas, she ain't met, Georgia made her, Georgia claimed her, Sweet Georgia Brown."
cobb,"Well, I figure against today's pitchers I'd only hit about .275,"
louis prima,"That's amazing, Mr. Cobb, considering your lifetime average is nearly a hundred points higher. Why do you think you'd only hit .275 against today's pitchers? "
cobb,"First of all I wanta thank you for that song, 'Sweet Georgia Brown... it's a great song about my home state and I appreciate it...  It's too bad such a fine song had to be stole by a buncha niggers playing a faggot game in their underwear..."
louis prima,"Thank you very much. Another round of applause for the Georgia Peach, Ty Cobb!"
cobb,"I got the mike, Dago -- gimme a God damn minute. Nobody's got respect for their elders any more. Cobb turns to the crowd which, even in it's drunken state, is appalled and in disbelief."
offstage,The Casino Manager winces and consults.
casino manager,"Oh God, here we go..."
cobb,"Hitting a baseball is really very easy... you can't force it... you can't overpower it... you go with the pitch... you let the bat do the work... it's all rhythm and flow... And Cobb starts demonstrating hitting techniques to the bewildered audience and casino staff. He strikes that familiar, strange stance -- choked up on the bat, a split grip, the bat held parallel to the ground... CUT TO:"
ramona,You again? You could learn some manners from your friend.
stump,I'll try harder.  You're a beautiful woman.
ramon,"It's the wig. Ramona pulls the wig off her head revealing a sea of bobby pins and hair pins tying her natural brown hair to her head. She sets the wig on the counter and scratches her natural scalp. RAMONA The damn thing itches but it's good for tips. Give me a scratch, will ya? Stump scratches the back of her scalp, somewhat embar- rassed and somewhat aroused. RAMON Turn you on? Hey, Harvey, another round. On him."
stump,Vodka and grapefruit juice. Ramona slaps the wig back on her head. Slightly akilter. She doesn't care. Harvey delivers another round. STUMP Your wig's crooked.
ramona,Does it bother you?
stump,"No, no... I was just -- "
stump,"I'm sorry. I didn't know.     I mean I'm not good at this. RAMONA Just divorced, huh?"
stump,"Not yet... RAMONA It's written all over ya.    Giant letters right across the forehead. D-I-V-O-R-C-E.     Ha! Plain as day. Ramona lets out a loud, hearty laugh without inhibition. STUMP It's obvious, huh?"
ramona,"Obvious.  So, if ya wanta pay me to screw, I won't do it. STUMP Then I won't."
ramona,Screw or pay?
stump,Whichever. 
stump,"No, I do."
ramona,"All this ambiguity -- I see why she's divorcing ya. Stump, completely befuddled, lets down completely. He doesn't care about getting laid or drunk or anything for the moment, except having someone to talk to -- the some- one is Ramona."
stump,I don't know what I'm saying or doing anymore... I'm trying to speak my heart. RAMONA Oh God... STUMP I told my wife I wanted a divorce. She said 'okay' -- then I realized maybe I don't. RAMONA Then go back to her. STUMP No.
ramona,"Then quit crying. You want a divorce, you don't want a divorce, you're asking marital advice from a woman you're trying to get in the sack -- Jeez Louise!"
stump,I'm not myself.
ramona,Who is? A sigh.   Stump is lost.    He motions to the bartender.
ramona,You being paid?
stump,"Very well. RAMONA Then it's not a lie. It's a job. Quit agonizing -- take the money, do what you gotta do, and get it over with. STUMP I can't. RAMONA Then quit. STUMP No!"
ramona,For godsakes why not? Stump has to think about this for a while.
stump,He knows greatness. I'm in the presence of greatness. I want to learn about greatness. She looks at him like he's crazy.
ramona,"Greatness is overrated. STUMP Maybe you're right, maybe you're right... RAMONA So what do you want?"
ramona,"Screwed, stewed, and tattooed! She laughs a hearty laugh, letting it all out."
stump,C'mere... I want to hold you.
ramona,You're so thoughtful -- the others are trying to get me drunk and you're trying to keep me sober.  You'd be good husband material. STUMP Not so fast --
ramona,I didn't mean --
stump,Come here. 
ramona,I'm not a whore.
stump,"Shh, shh... I know, I know... A moment of quiet, simple bliss -- when:"
cobb,"You two-timing bastard! You God damn Judas Iscariot! You stealing my girl! I'll kill you! STUMP She's not 'your' girl! And Cobb lashes out at Stump -- Stump tries to block the blow, but Cobb is relentless, and Cobb hits him again."
ramona,I don't want to!
cobb,What's this?! RAMONA My hair. COBB Put it back on.
ramona,"Who are you again? COBB I am the Georgia Peach. I have 4,191 base hits in 11,429 at- bats, 920 stolen bases, 2,244 runs scored, and 92 batting records...  And I want you to undress."
ramona,No. Cobb clicks the hammer of his gun with icy calm.
ramona,That don't scare me 'cause if you kill me I'll be dead and you ain't gonna screw a dead lady.
cobb,I might. 
ramona,You're right.    You might. COBB Take your clothes off.
cobb,You got big tits. I like big tits.
ramona," They aren't so big. They're average, actually -- but these bras are great. Push 'em right up there. I owe a lot to the bras and wigs. A girl needs what she needs --"
cobb,Shut up.    Take it off. She does.    And covers her breasts with her hands.
cobb,"Shy, huh?    Get on the bed. Ramona gets on the bed -- Cobb circles the bed continuously. COBB You're a beauty. Roll over."
ramona,"Mr. Cobb, I -- COBB Shut up."
ramona,I'm sure you --
cobb,Shut up! RAMONA What do you want from me?!
cobb,"Roll over. Terrified, she does. COBB I want you to do exactly what I say... RAMONA No..."
cobb,Exactly what I say...
cobb,A thousand dollars... He holds out the money for her.
ramona,"Do what you gotta do and get it over with, Mr. Cobb."
cobb,"She was a great piece of ass, Stumpy, best I ever had..."
stump,"Good, good... COBB Have we missed the Testimonial Dinner? STUMP No we haven't, Ty... now get some sleep... Stump tucks Cobb in his bed as the old man drifts into sleep, turns off the light, and heads back to his own room."
cobb,"Nothing like a cigarette girl and thirty hours of sleep to invigorate a man, Stumpy! You look like shit. STUMP Been writing, Ty... Cobb goes straight for the typewriter and yanks out a page, grabbing the stack of typed pages as well."
cobb,"Well let's see how we're doing... Cobb reads the pages with utter seriousness.       Stump watches. COBB Yes, God damn it, Stumpy, yes! Now you're getting it! None of this Sigmund Freud bullshit! Baseball, Stumpy, baseball! Yes! Cobb rushes to Stump and embraces him, almost like a child. His eyes are wet with tears. COBB You understand! People are no damn good but you're different! You're okay, Stumpy, you get it!  And I can trust you..."
cobb,My girl went for the nigger?
stump,I think they're just next to each other by accident.
cobb,Mona!   You with that nigger! Cobb's voice silences the tables.    Ramona looks up.
willie,He's crazy. RAMONA I know.
cobb,Willie!     Is she with you?!
cobb,My girl with my nigger!
stump,She's not your girl and he's not your --
security officer,He's got a gun. RAMONA Mr. Cobb! WILLIE Get down! Cobb on the table with a gun as Stump and police officers scramble to grab his gun hand. Customers hit the deck.
cobb,"What is the world coming to?! BLAM, BLAM, BLAM -- the gun is FIRED REPEATEDLY into the ceiling fixtures, into the mirrors above the tables. Cobb is wrestled to the table by several men, including Stump. And it takes all of them to escort the struggling Cobb out of the casino into the lobby. STUMP  We're leaving, we're leaving! There's no reason to press charges!"
stump,"Ty, Ty, Ty, calm down. It's time for the testimonial dinner!"
cobb,"Swear on a Bible, Stumpy -- I feel I can trust you now."
cobb, -- next to you -- the greatest player of all time. He hit 714 home runs?!
cobb,"Anybody can hit home runs. Now excuse me, I got work to do..."
stump,"Sorry, Ty -- And Cobb resumes into the tape recorder."
stump,... and I became expert at keeping the peace wherever we went...
cobb,"Y'know, Stumpy, with a friend like you, I just might go on forever... Cobb grabs the recorder mike and launches in again."
cobb," Until, by the grace of God, we arrived -- days, weeks, months later, I don't know -- in Cooperstown, New York, for his beloved testimonial dinner... DISSOLVE TO:"
stump,I've been looking forward to this for a long time --
cobb,You fucking liar. You've been hoping I'd die first.
stump,You got me wrong. COBB I got you right. But it's okay 'cause I need your help. Stump squirms.      A KNOCK at the door.    Stump answers it.
cobb,I sent you money for it. 
cobb,"You drank it, you mean. You can't go to the Hall of Fame like that. I won't allow it."
cochrane,"Things have been rough, Ty."
cobb,There's two things a man should never do -- complain or explain.  Now go buy a God damn tux!
cobb,"God damn it, Mickey, ya gotta give a better effort. "
stump,"Jesus, Ty, why not? COBB Because it would embarrass him. Cobb winces as he tries to rise, almost falling. COBB I don't wanta take the cane tonight."
stump,"You've got to have your cane. COBB I don't have to have anything -- if you stay near me... in case I wobble or something... just a firm hand right here...  That'll keep me upright. I'd appreciate it. Now how do I look? Cobb poses in his tux -- proudly, unsurely."
stump,You look like the greatest ballplayer of all time. You going to be okay?
cobb,I'll be okay when I hear the crowd. CUT TO:
cobb,"Thank you, my friend... And Cobb is met by the Hall of Fame director, CHARLES, 50, who shakes his hand and shows him in."
charles,"Hello, Mr. Cobb, good to see you again. And they head inside. CUT TO:"
cobb,"The boys'll get together later and have a little party, eh?"
crawford,"Be some parties tonight, Peach... "
cobb,"Stumpy, meet Rogers Hornsby, next to me the greatest hitter of all time --"
hornsby,"How d'ya do.   You're looking good, Ty..."
cobb,"I look like shit and you know it. We'll have a real smoker later, eh?"
hornsby,"Ohyeah... we'll tear it up good... The EMCEE raps a fork on a glass, bringing the dinner to order."
cobb,"What the hell is this?! STUMP It's a great film -- COBB Me and Speaker and the fix? STUMP I think the medication's getting to you, Ty -- I'm watching you run the bases."
cobb,What're you seeing? STUMP You and Connie Mack.
cobb,"Crawford and Foxx have something cooking in Room 212 -- STUMP Over here, Ty. COBB I never partied with these boys but they had a reputation."
foxx,Ty. COBB You got some booze?
foxx,No. 
cobb,Got any women in there?
foxx,Sure do. Cobb lights up.
cobb,Me and Stumpy want some action. FOXX Wanta meet some great broads? COBB We're ready. And Jimmy Foxx opens the door letting in Cobb and Stump. CUT TO:
crawford,"Hello, Ty.   You know my wife, Lillian?"
traynor,And this is Mrs. Traynor.
foxx,"Pearl, meet Ty Cobb and -- STUMP Al Stump."
foxx,Hornsby's got something on the third floor -- maybe more what you're looking for.
stump,"You sure you're up for this? COBB I've never been readier! Cobb takes a hit on his flask and they knock at the door. Hornsby answers the door -- we can see a party behind him, full of old players, booze, cigars -- and even some women, though the whole thing is infinitely tamer than the smokers Cobb remembers."
cobb,"Rajah! HORNSBY You ain't comin' in, Ty. COBB It's me!   An' Stumpy here!"
cobb,Who's in there?!
cobb,Let me talk to Mickey.
cochrane,Ty...
cobb,"Ya look good in that tux, Mick. COCHRANE I can't let ya in, Ty. It's Rogers' party. I'm an invited guest. COBB God damn it, let me in! Cobb tries to break into the party but Hornsby rushes over and shoves the door in his face, leaving Ty and Stump alone. COBB Presidents of the United States of America used to invite me to the White House to drink their Scotch and smoke their cigars and fuck their women. STUMP Let's go to the motel, Ty... Cobb heads down the hallway pounding on every door -- he's ready to explode."
cobb,"Let me in, God damn it! I invented this game! Let me in!"
stump,"Let's go home, Ty, this isn't a good place to be..."
cobb,Take me back to the Hall!
cobb,What did you see on that film tonight?
stump,I saw Ty Cobb playing baseball. COBB That's all?
stump,That's all.
cobb,"I was raised in the Baptist Church but I know that Heaven is just the ol' oskefagus -- the change-up. You swing from your ass 'cause you think life is a fastball down the middle and after your bat has crossed the plate and you're all off balance and looking stupid, the ball just kinda flutters across home, slow and juicy and hittable, and as it crosses the plate, the ball looks at you and smiles a nasty smile and laughs its way into the catcher's mitt...  We don't just lose -- we're made fools of."
stump,You were the best.
cobb,Save the romance for the book...  ... and take me home to Georgia.
cobb,"Greatest biography ever written -- STUMP  The book, like Cobb, was almost finished. But he was dying slower than I was writing, and like everything else, he viewed it as a competition that he was not going to lose."
stump,I have your brother in the car.
florence,Tyrus? STUMP Yes.   And he'd like to see you.
florence,"Young man, the family he talks about never existed."
stump,"He loved his father. FLORENCE If his father, if my father, was such a great man, why did Tyrus turn out to be so evil? Stump hesitates.      He doesn't have a ready answer."
stump,He's dying.   He just wants to see you.
cobb,"Well? STUMP It wasn't your sister. The woman in the house said your sister moved a long time ago... she doesn't know where. COBB You cocksucking liar. My sister doesn't want to see me and you're lying. And Stump, at last, goes off -- STUMP Liar?! A cocksucking liar?! Of course I'm a liar! That's what I'm paid to do, isn't it?! Lie about Ty Cobb?!"
cobb,"If you didn't like the job, why didn't you quit?"
stump,Who would take care of you?
cobb,"Don't give me the sob-sister routine. STUMP I listen to your bullshit, I interpret and shape and find words for your bullshit and you give me nothing but grief!"
stump,"That was your sister alright, and she didn't want anything to do with you either!"
cobb,"I forgive her. Stump walks into the cemetery to escape Cobb, who follows nonetheless with a cool resolution. Stump laughs at Cobb's comment. "
cobb, Forgiveness is crucial to human maturity and religious growth.
stump,Religious growth?!
cobb,"We all need to forgive more, Al... you oughta try it. You're too angry. You're all pent up."
stump,"I'm angry? Through the cemetery they keep walking, up a long hill full of tombstones and shrines and sprays of dead and dying flowers and gaudy plastic bouquets. Cobb following steadily along with his cane, several paces behind Stump."
cobb,Is it the divorce?    You gotta let go of it...
stump,I love her!   I don't want a divorce!
cobb,"Sure ya do. You're just so used to accommodating people that you don't know what you want anymore. I accommodate nobody. Stump whirls near the top of the hill to face Cobb who continues making his way along, slowly and surely."
stump,But you have no friends! 
cobb,You mock my family -- you mock me. Cobb grabs Stump by the throat and stares him in the eye. COBB My father was a great man! STUMP Then why are you such a bastard?
cobb,"Being a bastard is a small price to pay for greatness. I, too, am a great man."
stump,Let me go!
cobb,"My mother didn't kill my father. STUMP What're you talking about? Cobb's fist clinches Stump's throat, forcing him to hear. Outside the mausoleum, RAIN pours down now, a Southern spring thunderstorm unleashing torrents."
cobb,My father told my mother he was leaving town for the weekend but he came back to the edge of the woods where he tied up his horse... CUT TO:
stump,What the hell're you talking about? Cobb holds out his flask for Stump. COBB You need a drink. STUMP Fuck the drink!
stump,Get your hands off me!
cobb,"C'mon, Al...  Come in out of the rain..."
cobb,"You're an educated man... tell me what you think... Stump just sits there, drinking."
cobb,"A man must defend his mother at all times, isn't that right, Al? Or am I a fool?"
stump,"A man must defend his mother at all times. COBB That's what I thought... And the two men sit there silently, rocking slightly, trying to stay warm, when there is -- Suddenly a KNOCK at the door -- They stare at each other."
cobb,In here. 
cobb,"I'm afraid it's divorce, Stumpy. I know this routine. MAN WITH BRIEFCASE You're being sued for divorce."
stump,"But my wife and I are still talking?! COBB Yeah, and what she's saying is 'fuck you.' STUMP Fuck me? Well fuck her.     No, fuck him. Stump reaches for the gun and aims it at the man."
stump,You ain't serving me no papers.
stump,I love my wife.
cobb,"We all loved our wives, Al, that's got nothing to do with it. "
cobb,"There's a million broads out there, Stumpy -- put down the gun."
cobb,Al... no... Al... Al...
cobb,No! Stump pulls the TRIGGER -- CLICK.     Empty.
cobb,It's forgotten already. I saw nothing. Nothing happened.
stump,"Yes it did. COBB Al, listen to me. "
stump,I get it... I get it... A moment.    A look.
cobb,Then get some sleep.   You look pathetic.
cobb,"You don't have a point of view, Stumpy, you ain't worth killing..."
stump,Ty.  Peach... Stump struggles to his elbow to find Cobb.
stump,Ty! Stump leaps out of bed and looks around.
stump,I'm here to see... 
stump,... Mr. Cobb.
receptionist,Be careful. He's got a gun and we haven't been able to get it away from him.
stump,"I know, I know... Stump hurries down the hall to the source of the noise. A small group of doctors, orderlies and NURSES are gathered outside Cobb's door, afraid to enter. Also there are two civilians in business suits. NURSE #1 He doesn't want visitors. Stump ignores the advice and enters the room. CUT TO:"
cobb,"Hey, Stumpy, where you been? You can't believe the shit they call food in this joint. You get some sleep? Good. I had quite a read last night... A Nurse enters warily, but determined, with a small sy- ringe."
cobb,Well don't poke around too long.
cobb,"She's a nice piece of ass, eh, Stumpy?  You come back later and climb on the big fella?"
cobb,You're a God damn romantic! The truth is a whore! Just like you and just like my mother! Another NURSE enters and announces.
cobb,Tell the son of a bitch to go downstairs and have a Pepsi -- I got no time for business.
cobb," Bad, ain't it?"
cobb,Get the hell outta here! Everybody but Stumpy! Out!
stump,It's all... confusing... 
bill,"... so a woman goes into a bar with a duck under her arm, sits down next to a drunk who looks up and says, 'Where'd you find that pig?' An' the woman says 'That's no pig, that's a duck.' "
frank,"Stranger!   Another round on me! Stump settles in at the table. CRONIES Long time no see, etc..."
stump,"Good to see you guys... how's it goin'? Alan, how's that novel coming? Must be about done by now? MUD Uh, actually, I haven't started it yet... been kinda busy..."
bill,We all been busy...
stump,"Yeah, I know how it is... FRANK We read that Cobb died. STUMP Yeah... finally gave up the ghost."
frank,So?   What was he like? MUD Were the stories true or were they exaggerated? 
bill,Or was he just one of the guys?
stump,"The truth? CRONIES Ohyeah, the absolute truth, no bullshit, give it to us straight, etc... STUMP The truth? Stump takes a drink and looks his friends in the eye. STUMP A prince and a great man has fallen. Murmurs of deep satisfaction from the Cronies. Affirmation. CRONIES Yes, awright, we knew it... etc... BILL Helluva guy, eh?"
stump,"A helluva guy, a great man, a misunderstood artist, a fierce competitor but a sweet man at heart... a gentle soul... As Stump starts lying to his enraptured audience, we PULL BACK AND UP, going FROM the intimate center of the table TO a cool distance, and --"
