Speaker,Dialogue
logan,"...Uh. Please stop, guys. Those,.. those are chrome plated lugs."
teen,"Yo, Driver, you got any Bang in this whip?!"
other teen,`Bitch is deaf.
logan,"Back to work, old man."
old lady,Shouldn't we lock the doors?
logan,"They're locked, ma'am."
voice,Logan.
hispanic woman,...I knew it was you.
logan,Don't we all.
hispanic woman, What the hell happened to you?! What are you hiding from?!
pierce,As I live and breathe. The Wolverine. And he's a junkie now.
logan,Who the fuck are you?
pierce,"Y'know, you got some buckshot in your door.  I heard you were in Phoenix. Food's better there by the way. But then, last night, some friends in Texas H-P called, told me they found three dead cholos in a pullout out on 54. Not unusual, except one was missing a hand. Another a leg. Multiple parallel lacerations. Slashes, femoral, thoracic. So, they're thinking it was either an escaped Tiger or Freddy Krueger... but neither of those can drive, one being fictional the other extinct. And since the wheel lugs they found belong to a `24 Gauntlet--"
logan,Get out. Now.
pierce,Has she found you yet? ...Gabriela? 
logan,I don't know any Gabriela. So get the fuck out.
pierce,"I know what you're hiding, amigo. Cue ball south of the border?"
logan,What do you want?
pierce,A little ...cooperation.
logan,"Mr. Espiranza, yes, I know I said June, but I want the boat now. Yes. Why does that mean the price go up? "
caliban,He's having a bad day.
logan,They're all bad days.
caliban,"He needed these six hours ago. This is not enough, you know. It won't last through the week."
logan,I'm working on it.
caliban,Your turn.
logan,He's not talking with anybody.
caliban,Don't be so sure. He had all these details. I thought that tank was supposed to provide some sort of barrier. It's got all these cracks in it. What good is that?
logan,Please stop.
caliban,He's been asking questions again. He's trying to read my mind.
logan, That's what these are for.
charles,"Friends, I have Good News today! It's not about what you do. It's not about your deeds. You can't live up to his rules. God knows you can't. That's OK! We're imperfect!"
logan,No.
charles,"The new Quesalupa from Taco Bell. Get it with chicken, get it with steak. But with cheese baked right in the shell it's the next big--  Who are you?"
logan,You know who I am.
charles, The man who puts me to sleep.
logan,We could both use some sleep.
charles,What are you fucking doing to me!?
charles,How long have I been here?
logan,"You remember what they are. The shots mellow the seizures, the pills keep them from happening."
charles,"Fuck off, Logan."
logan,So you know who I am now.
charles,I always know who you are. Sometimes I just don't recognize you.
logan,Take the pills.
charles, ...you leave me alone with that fucking Albino... he won't listen to me. I know a damn speciation when I see one.
logan,A what?
charles,A speciation.  A new mutant. A young one. There are forces trying to kill them! They need help!
logan,Too bad you're not in that business anymore.
charles,"They want your help, not mine.  Oh, yes. That's how fucking stupid they are. They're waiting for you. At the Statue of Liberty."
logan,"The Statue of Liberty was a long time ago, Charles. A long time."
charles,Impossible.
logan,You always thought we were part of God's Plan. Maybe we were just God's mistake.
charles,What a disappointment you are.
logan,I'm not in the mood for bedtime--
charles,"A warm capper to life as an assassin, hooked on barbiturates.  You were an animal, but we took you in. I gave you a family."
logan, They're gone now.
charles,What did you do?
logan,It's for your own good.
charles,No. NO it's NOT! You're waiting for me to die!
caliban,I don't want to fight but we need to talk about these things. There are things.
logan,What things.
caliban,Well. Would it be considered nagging if repeated my observation that the dose is too low. To suppress the seizures.
logan,It's what the guy gave me. I wasn't in a position to make demands.
caliban,I almost died this morning. That seizure was a--
logan,It wasn't even a minute.
caliban,"It felt a lot longer than a minute. I couldn't breathe. I was in a terrible state. You're less affected, Logan-- Please don't give me that look. You know he needs a higher dose. And I know you've got more money squirreled away."
logan,That money's to get us out of here.
caliban,"No. Not us. You and him. You're saving up for a bloody Sunseeker. I don't see myself hiding below deck like Nosferatu, doing laundry, do you? ...Folding your underwear. Making pigs in a blanket."
logan,I don't need this right now.
caliban,"A year ago, you asked me to help you. And God knows I try but I can't help you, not really, if you don't talk to me. I hear you at night. You aren't sleeping. You don't want to talk about that. Or the booze you're drinking or the pus you keep wiping from your knuckles or the blood I wash from your clothes or those brand new holes in your chest, that haven't healed. And I very much doubt you want to talk about the fact that you can't read the label on the side of that bottle.  It's Ibuprofen."
woman's voice,Senor Logan.
logan,"Oh, Jesus."
woman,Please. ...We need a ride.
logan, Not available. Call a cab.
woman, I'm not crazy. My name is Gabriela Lopez.
logan,I don't want to know your name!
logan,Anyone can do that job.
gabriela,No. It has to be you. I'll give you fifty thousand dollars
logan," How'd you find me? Huh?! `Cause you are fucking up my life, lady. The people after you are on my ass now."
gabriela,...Sightings... were posted.
logan,Sightings.
gabriela,"On chat rooms. People said someone looked like The Wolverine was in El Paso, driving. Said he looked old."
logan,"And by people, you mean fat fucktards living in their parents' basements playing with dolls?"
gabriela,"Whoever it was, they were right."
lady manager,Hey!
gabriela, No. Please. Stop!
lady manager,They have to pay for damages. She's got cash. I seen it.
logan,Get your fat ass back in your office. You'll get your money.
gabriela, Don't let her call anyone. They will find us. They will kill us.
gabriela,I`m a nurse.  Was. In Mexico City.
logan,When did that happen?
gabriela,This morning. Near the border. I got away from them. But they know my car now.
logan,Where did you get this?
gabriela,It doesn't matter.
logan,Does to me.
gabriela,My boyfriend. He wants to kill me. And take her.
logan,That's your daughter?
gabriela,...yes.  Please. There won't be any problems. Not if we leave now.
logan,I can't leave right now.
gabriela,We have to be there Friday.
logan,Or what?
gabriela,Or we miss our chance. To cross.  Our... family. They will be there that day. No other day.
logan,"I can get you there Friday. But I need to go home first, take care of some things."
gabriela,Bring us with you. Please. We can help with whatever you need to do.
logan,I'll be back in a few hours.  Keep this locked. And tell your mommy I know she's lying.
caliban,Tell me you didn't rob a bank.
logan,I got a job that's gonna pay enough to change things. But I have to go away. For a week.
charles,I like those. They make you look younger.
logan,"Charles. Listen. I gotta go for a few days. I got a long ride for some good money. When I get back, we're getting out of here, okay. Gonna drive down to Yelapa and get ourselves a boat. Live on the ocean."
charles,And... you'll be safe there? From the people after you?
logan,Yeah. I'll be safe.
logan,Ready to go?
logan,...Fuck.
caliban,Hello! Logan! --What happened?
logan, The job was wrong to begin with.
caliban,I'll close your trunk. --I'm making borscht for Charles if you want some. He got dressed for lunch
caliban,...Who does that belong to?
logan,Aren't you supposed to see shit coming?
caliban,"I'm a glorified truffle pig, not a clairvoyant."
logan,Go inside. Keep Charles quiet.  Go. Inside.
logan,He's been dead for a year.
pierce,I need the girl.
logan,What girl.
pierce,"One that goes with that ball you're holding. That's special rubber, you know. Coated with something called J-Tek. Gets in through the skin.  You feel calmer?"
logan,There's no girl here.
pierce,I know you went to the motel.
logan,I was called there. There was no girl. Just the woman.
pierce,"""The woman"".  That hurts. Say, you didn't shoot the poor thing, did you?"
logan,No. Did you?
pierce,I asked you first.
logan,I don't like guns.
pierce,"Of course.  I wish you had called me, Logan. Like I asked."
logan,Hey!
charles,Logan.
caliban,Looks like Ex-military. Maybe a bounty hunter?
logan,Worse.
caliban,He's by himself?
logan,"Not for long.  Get him back in his ride. Drive him to the wash and dump him. Then take the car into Juarez, leave it for the vultures."
caliban,What if he wakes up before I get there?
logan,Text me where you are and we'll pick you up.
charles,"You did what you could, Laura.  Well. Yes. Of course, it's painful."
logan,You'll get it back-- after I figure out what you and your mother have got us into.
charles,Logan.
logan,What.
charles,That wasn't her mother you met.
logan,So she talks.
charles,We're communicating.
logan, We have to go. Leave. It isn't safe here anymore. And you can't have an attack out there. Understand?
charles, She's the mutant I told you about. The one we have to help.
logan,She's not a mutant.
charles,"Yes, she is."
logan," What's her gift, eating? Pipe throwing?"
charles,"It's alright, Laura. It's only a train. A choo choo."
logan, We gotta go.
pierce,"You're fucked now, mutey."
charles,It's alright. It's just another--
logan, --it's not a train. We gotta go!
charles," Don't be afraid, child. He'll come back for you!"
charles,...bloody hell.
charles,Logan!
logan,She's not our problem.
charles,I know what you just did.
federale commander,Este es el mutante! Capturar o matar!
charles,Logan...
logan,I'm thinking.
charles," The child, Logan. We mustn't forget Laura. ...Logan..."
logan, Please be quiet.
pierce,"Ah, Charles Xavier. The most wanted octogenarian in North America--"
logan,Where's Caliban?
charles," Excuse me. I'm a nonagenarian, actually..."
pierce,How about you tell me where the girl is first. Or maybe I ought to ask the cue ball. Seems friendly.
logan,"I told you, she's not here. Where's Caliban?!"
pierce,I left him in the same hole you were going to leave me.
logan, You got extra barbecue tongs for this guy?
pierce,"Jesus. Seeing you this way, Wolverine, it breaks my heart."
logan,"As soon as I rip it out of your chest, fuck-stick."
federale commander, No one goes in without Federale escort. I am in charge.
pierce,That-a-girl.
federale commander,Tomar el mutante!
pierce,"Commander, stop!"
federale commander,You said alive or dead.
pierce,Laura! NO! NO!!
charles,...My Lord.
charles," ...As I said, Logan, she's a mutant... Like you. Very much like you, in fact."
logan,Hold on!
logan,Who the fuck are you?
charles,"You know who she is, Logan."
logan,No. I don't.
charles,Does she remind you of anybody?
pierce,Leave nothing behind fellas. We were not here!
pierce,Wakey wakey.
caliban,I'm sorry. I believe you're thinking of someone else.
pierce,"'I'm not mistaken, you used to work for my team, for the good guys. You were helping round up all the old mutes."
caliban,I will not. I will not help you.
pierce,Of course that's what you'd say. But then I got this theory that people don't really change.
caliban,PLEASE--
pierce,Beware the light.
gabriela,I am a nurse and for ten years I have worked at Transigen research in Mexico City.
gabriela,They told us they were part of a pharmaceutical study.
charles,Is there more? Play it.
logan,Battery's dead. We need a plug.
charles,How far is it?  To North Dakota.
logan,Charles.
charles,You took that woman's money. You told her you would take the child there.
logan,What is she?
charles,"She's your daughter, Logan.  Alkali had your genetic code."
logan,Not just mine.
charles,Logan...
logan,I don't wanna hear it. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
charles,Logan.
logan,Stop.
charles,I have to pee.
logan,Last ride. Then we're leaving.
charles,Stop it. For God's sake I can do that myself!
logan,"Well, you're not doing it!"
clerk,Yo. Girlie. You gotta pay for that.
logan,Not okay.
gabriela,"As the children became older, they became difficult to control."
charles,...Is this where we're hiding out?
logan,"We're not hiding out. We're gonna get a couple hours sleep, clean up, get new clothes, ditch the limo, get a new ride and get the fuck out."
logan,Keep it out front.
logan,Please wait till we're in the room.
charles,"This film is a classic, Laura. Almost a hundred years old now. I first saw it at the Esoldo in Dewsbury when I was your age."
logan,...For fuck's sake.
clerk,"Who are you guys? More cops? Dude, I already told them everything."
logan,You read this in your spare time?
charles,--Logan.
logan,Right. Fine.
charles,"Good-bye, Logan."
logan,...Fuck.
dealer,"I know the finish looks beat but it's a `19, got less than sixty on the ody and three hundred horses under the hood. For 10 grand I can get it re-painted for you, fresh tires mounted and balanced, and complete paperwork."
logan,...yeah. Here's the thing. I'll give you twelve as is-- if you can forget the paperwork.
dealer,"You still need tires, tiger. They're bald."
logan,How long is that gonna take?
dealer,"Hour, maybe less. If you want, you can get yourself a glass a lunch across the street while you wait."
logan,Jesus Christ...
bartender,You want a refill?
logan,I'll take the bottle.
bartender, You passing through?
logan,I don't know.
valet,Sir? Are the keys in it?
logan,"Come on, come on!"
logan,We have to go.
charles,I'm so sorry. Oh God...
logan,Hey! Now!
logan,This way!
pierce,Get the bodies.
logan,Knock it off.
charles,"She's a child, Logan. In point of fact she's--"
logan,How long has it been since you took your meds?  Charles. How long?
charles,...I don't know. Two days.
logan,"You saw what happened last night. If that shit had gone on longer, everyone at that casino--"
charles,I did what I had to do to stop those men from taking Laura.
logan,You didn't do anything. You freaked out and had a fucking seizure.
charles,"I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated, rambling on like some lunatic. So much easier on you."
logan,Easier? There's nothing easy about you.
charles,"Yes, Yes please, be like the rest of the world and blame someone else for your boring shit."
logan,"Yeah, I know, Pop, I'm such a giant DISAPPOINTMENT--"
charles,Self loathing. Anger. Disdain. Cowardice. Oh yes. Your peaks and your valleys. Mostly valleys-- it's all so Goddamn boring.
logan,What are we doing?!
charles,There is a young mutant. Sitting in our car. 
logan,Yes. It means nothing to me. Especially since Nurse Gabriela made all this Eden shit up from fucking comic books.
charles,What are you talking about?
logan,Give those to him. Take out two and give them to him.
charles,What do you mean--
logan,Now. For fuck's sake. Take the pills. Now.
charles,Logan.
logan,Take them.  Give him the pills.
charles,LOGAN --
logan,--GIVE HIM THE FUCKING PILLS!
charles,Happy?
logan, Cop. Fuck.
charles,What does he want?
logan,She. I might have been speeding.
charles,Are you sure that's all it is?
logan,"If it wasn't, there'd be a lot more than her behind us.  I need you to please try and not kill this lady. Okay?"
logan,"Was I going a mite fast, officer?"
trooper,"License and registration, please."
logan,"I just bought it, but I-- here--"
trooper," Any idea just how ""mite"" fast you were going, Mr... Howlett?"
logan,Seventy? Ish?
trooper,Try ninety six.  Ish.
logan,Shit. I didn't think this thing could make that.
trooper,You're not from round here. It's harvest season. You need to be more careful. This your daughter?
logan,"Yes, ma'am."
trooper,"What's your name, honey?"
logan,She doesn't speak.
trooper,But she does have a name.
logan,Laura.
trooper,"That your name, honey?  And is this man your father?"
charles, My son has a bit of a lead foot. I try to tell him that Mount Rushmore will still be there and just as beautiful a day from now.
trooper,"You got a nice family. Try to keep `em safe, James."
logan,HEY--
charles,"Language, Logan. And you're screaming at a machine."
logan,"What, she can gut a man with her feet, but she can't hear naughty words?"
charles,She can learn to be better.
logan,"You mean, better than me."
charles,"Actually, yes. And by the way, Laura's foot claws are an obvious result of her gender.  In a pride of lions, females are caregivers of the young and hunters of the pride, they have front claws to hunt and foot claws for defense. They use the foot claw to strike the belly or bladder of the attacker, thus ensuring their escape and survival."
logan,Shit. Oh well.
charles,We have to help them.
logan,We have to keep moving. Someone will come along.
charles,Someone has come along.
mother,Nate! Get off the road!
logan,Can I give you a hand?
father,Sure. Thank you.
mother,Nate.
nate,What.
logan,James. Howlett.
mother,"Thank you so much for your help, sir. I'm Kathryn, and this our son, Nate."
logan,Yeah. That's Laura.  Chuck.
will,Where you all headed?
logan,North.
kathryn,"Can we at least give the three of you a decent meal, show our appreciation? We don't live far from here."
charles, That would be lovely.
logan,"No, thank you, we really can't--  Laura, get back here."
kathryn,Please. It's the least we can do. And you're going to have to stop for dinner somewhere.
caliban,Please let me be...
red-haired man,"I'm offering an opportunity, Caliban. To redeem yourself, to protect the world, and, in the process, save your friends."
caliban,What do you want from me?! I did what I could and your human toaster ovens fucked it all up.
red-haired man,I agree the Reavers have not been effective. I'm bringing new tools to bear. But I still need someone to point us in the right direction.
caliban,"No, no, no. I can't keep--"
red-haired man,"Breathe. Breathe. What does he have, the old man, your friend? Alzheimer's? ALS? A degenerative brain disease in the world's most dangerous brain. What a combo."
nate,"We thank you, Lord, for this food... and we also thank you, Lord, for sending our new friends, the Howletts to our aid today. Amen."
charles,"Slow down, child."
kathryn,There's plenty more if you want.
will,Where are you all heading?
logan,Oregon.
charles,South Dakota.
kathryn,Vacation?
charles,"Yes. Long overdue. We're city folk. Always wanted to take a road trip, see the country.  Meet the people who live in it."
kathryn,That sounds lovely. I've been trying to get Will here to take a vacation for years now.
will,"And if we go out traipsing around the country, who's gonna take care of this place?"
kathryn,"Exactly. I say, let it go."
will,And live off what?
kathryn,The Lord will provide.
will,"Well, I'm still waiting for him to provide me with a new thresher."
kathryn," All the same, I'd love to travel someday."
charles,And I bet you will.
nate,I could drop out of school.
kathryn,Let's not go that far.
charles,"Kathryn, that was easily the best meatloaf I've ever had."
kathryn,"Thank you, Chuck."
logan,"Oh. I uh, I--"
will,Kathryn.
kathryn,What? It's a natural thing to ask.
charles,He was. She passed.
kathryn,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
charles,He killed her.
logan," Ma'am, I can't thank you enough for dinner. But we have a long drive ahead of us."
kathryn,"You need to rest, don't you?"
logan,We'll find a motel.
will,Nearest is two hours from here and it's not very--
kathryn,They're gonna stay here. We have a perfectly fine room upstairs for your daughter and father and you can sleep in the living room on the convertible.
logan,"Kathryn. That's very nice of you, but we really should hit the--"
charles,We could leave first thing in the morning. Crack of dawn as it were.
logan,"Let's go wash up, Pop."
charles,--two days on the road with one meal and hardly any sleep. She's eleven and I'm fucking ninety.
logan,That's a hundred and one reasons to keep moving.
charles,I'm not a box of avocados.
logan,And then what. We stay the night and then what?
charles,We take Laura to her friends in Eden and then... then we buy that Sunseeker.
logan,What is it?
will,"Nate, go fill up the tub before we lose pressure."
kathryn, They shut it off again.
logan,"Who's ""they?"""
kathryn, You best deal with it now.
will,It can wait till morning. We got rain last night.
kathryn,Will. We have three guests in this house and sink full of dishes.
will,Alright. You're right.  The pump station that supplies us is a mile and a half from here. Sometimes it gets itself shut off.
nate,By assholes.
charles,My son can go with you.
will,"Oh, no. Thank you. But these men who did this, they can be--"
nate,I'll come.
kathryn,No. You have homework.
logan,I'll go.
logan,There's a TV in here.
charles, I'm fine.
logan,Okay... Get some rest.
charles,"You know, Logan. This is what life looks like. A house, people who love each other. A safe place. Take a moment and feel it.  You still have time."
logan,Charles. The world is not the same as it was. We're taking a risk here. And where we're going. Eden. It doesn't exist. Her nurse got it from a comic book.
charles,It is for Laura.
will, Don't worry. We won't need it.
will,"Canewood Beverage bought up everything out here. Except us. When we wouldn't sell, they tried eminent domain. Then screwing with our water. Couple months ago, someone poisoned our dogs."
logan,"So today, out on the highway--"
will,Who knows. Maybe.
logan,So why do people eat it?
will,"They don't. They drink it.  Corn syrup. Its in all those drugged up drinks everyone's having nowadays-- to stay awake, feel strong, cheer up, sexy, whatever. Used to be a time when a bad day was just a bad day, you know?"
logan,Mine still are.
will,Looks like we'll be here a while.
nate,I'm not too good at math.
will,How long's your girl been that way?  Mute.
logan,Since... well.. the beginning.
will,"Some ways I envy you. They get to be Nate's age, the nonsense that comes out their mouth. Makes you question the point of it all."
logan,You're a lucky man.
will, I guess I am.
logan,That should hold it.
will,Until the next time.
will,Don't know why I bother.
jackson,"Evening, Mr. Munson."
will,Why don't you ask your boys?
jackson,"You understand, you're trespassing right now, right?"
will,I have an easement with the previous owner of your property.
jackson,Previous being the operative word.  Who's this?
logan, I'm nobody. Just a guy telling you to get back in your nice truck and play Okie dickhead somewhere else.
jackson,"You hire some muscle, Mr. Munson?"
will,He's a friend of mine.
jackson,A friend with a big mouth.
logan,I hear that a lot.
jackson,"Then you probably hear this, too."
logan,More than I'd like.
jackson,Then you know the drill. I'm gonna count to three and you are gonna start walking away.
will,I got rights to this water --
jackson,One.
will,And I have a lawyer now--
jackson,TWO--
logan,Three.
will,You've had training.
logan,Some.
will,Wish I had you around all the time.  Sure you don't want to stay?
logan,"No, but I'll take a drink if you got one."
will,Kathryn doesn't like booze in the house.
logan, Maybe I got something in the truck.
charles,...Don't wake her yet. Let her have another hour.
pierce,Your baby boy just took out the most wanted mutey in the world.
caliban,You said you wanted the girl! You said you just wanted the girl!
will,"Since Nate was born, I try not to imbibe much. Maybe once a month."
logan,"Only on days that end in ""Y."""
kathryn, Put her down.
kathryn,"Stay down there, Will!"
reaver driver, I'll pick em up -- meet em halfway. Let the clean up crew in.
rice,"We learned the hard way with the X-23's. We assumed, because they were children, their emotional responses could be manipulated. But you can't nurture rage. You must simply design it. "
pierce,Who the fuck is that?
logan,"You need to keep this around you. Charles. Listen, you need--"
jackson,"Come out here now, Munson!"
jackson,"I don't know what Munson's paying you, but I'm willing to let bygones be bygones. We could start you at 5G. A week that is."
pierce,"You're the one he listens to, Doc."
charles,...our boat... ...our Eden...
caliban,Beware the light.
logan,Hold still! Stop it! Stop!
rice,"You did fine, twenty four. Breathe. You're healing. You did well. You're a newborn by any measure. Just breathe. Your body has work to do. Hemostasis, angiogenesis, epithelialization, stromal cell proliferation -- Here. This will help with the pain."
logan,Well. It's got water and... it's...
old doctor,Welcome back. I was starting to think I was gonna have to tell that nice little girl out in the waiting room that her daddy's gone.
logan,"...Nice to meet you too, Doc, but I need to get on my--"
old doctor,What you need is rest... and treatment. You need to check yourself in somewhere and--
logan,--I'm alright. I'm fine.
old doctor,"No. You're not. I mean, I know you're different. But that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you. You need to check yourself into a hospital and run some tests, find out what it is."
logan,...I know what it is.
old doctor,"Please. Mister. If you don't want to go to a hospital, maybe I can--"
logan,--Doc. Look at me. You seem like a nice man. But you wanna save a life? Save yours. And everyone else's in this place. Let us get on our way.
logan,"You can't just take shit, you know."
logan,"Look. I don't know how you got me here,.. but thank you."
laura,De nada.
logan,...You can talk?
logan,You can talk.
logan,What the fuck?! Why haven't you-- What's all this bullshit been for the last two thousand miles of--
laura,Tu espera que hable con tu cuando no mirarme? Tu espera que hable con tu cuando me insultas y tratar de dejarme atrs!?--
logan,SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!
laura,"Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah and Rictor."
logan,Who is that?
laura,"North Dakota.  Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah and Rictor."
logan,Okay. Look. This place. Your mom... she read too many... stories.
laura,"Si, Eden, por favor."
logan, --those are the names of the people who made up these stories. Something happened once and these people made it into a big lie...
laura,Le pagaron me llevo a este lugar! Por qu no puedes llevarme a este lugar!
logan,"Yes, I know. It's a long way."
laura,"Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah and Rictor."
logan,Stop saying those names--
laura,Vaminos!
logan,Do. Not. Hit. Me.
laura,"Jonah, Gideon--"
logan,--And stop saying those--
laura,"--Rebecca, Delilah and Rictor."
logan,Okay-- ENOUGH. Enough.
pierce,"That ain't a torx, honey. That's a phillips head. I need a torx."
nurse,This? Or this. They look the same.
military nurse,Wow. Responsive.
pierce,What?
