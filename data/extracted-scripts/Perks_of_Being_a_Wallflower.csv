Speaker,Dialogue
senior bully,"Hop, freshman toads. Hop!    Move it, boys!"
linebacker,"Man, you got big."
nose tackle,"Worked out all summer.   Rock hard, dude."
brad hays,Would you guys get a room?
candace,Seniors only.  What are you doing with a plastic spork?
derek,I don't want to bring back silverware--
candace,"Derek, you're Earth Club Treasurer."
patrick,"Boys, the prick punch is not a toy. I learned that in 'Nam back in '68. ""Callahan,"" the sergeant said, ""put down that prick punch and go kill some gooks."""
patrick,My name is Patrick. You call me Patrick or you call me nothing.
patrick,"Chapter 1. Surviving your fascist shop teacher, who needs to put kids down to feel big.  Oh, wow. This is useful guys. We should read on."
bill,"Shhh. I'm Mr. Anderson. And thanks to Teach for America, I'm going to be your teacher for freshman English. This semester, we're going to be learning Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. Genius book. Now, who wants to get out of the first pop quiz?"
freshman girl,Shakespeare.
bill,"That's a great guess, but no, Shakespeare didn't write novels. Anybody else?  The author was..."
bill,"I'll give you a free ""A"" on anything but the final term paper if you get it right."
bill,You should learn to participate.
charlie,"Thank you, sir, but if my English teacher is the only friend I make today, that would be sort of depressing."
bill,Yeah.   I could see that.
charlie,"Don't worry, Mr. Anderson.     I'm okay."
patrick, I would happily not take shop...
senior bully,"Hey, Freshman Toad."
derek,"Mmmm. This chicken paprikash is delicious, Mrs. Kelmeckis."
mother,"Thank you, Derek. It's Charlie's favorite. He was a little nervous about starting high school, so I made it."
father,"You feel a little silly being nervous now, huh, champ?"
charlie,"Yes, sir.    I sure do."
father,I told you. Just give 'em a smile and be yourself. That's how you--
candace,"""--make friends in the real world."""
father,You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.
derek,"Freshman year is tough, but you really find yourself."
father," Thanks, Derek."
mother,I think you could be a little nicer to Derek.
father,I'm sorry.     The kid's a pussy.   I can't stand him.
derek, I hope you love the mix I made.     The cover is hand-painted.
candace,"Charlie, do you want this?"
charlie,Are you sure?
candace,He gives me one every week.
patrick,Come on Devils! Woooooo!
patrick,"Suck it, virginity pledges!"
charlie,Hey... Patrick.
patrick,"Hey! You're in my shop class, right? How's your clock coming?"
charlie,My dad's building it.
patrick,"Yeah. Mine looks like a boat.  You want to sit over here, or are you waiting for your friends?"
charlie,No.   I'll sit if that's okay.
patrick,"Thanks for not calling me ""Nothing"" by the way. It's an endless nightmare. And these assholes actually think they're being original."
charlie,"So, uh... you like football?"
patrick,Love it.
charlie,"Then, maybe you know my broth--"
patrick,"Hey, Sam."
sam,Question. Could the bathrooms here be more disgusting?
patrick,"Yes, they call it the men's room."
sam,"Well, I finally got hold of Bob."
patrick,Party tonight?
sam,No. He's still trying to shag that waitress from the Olive Garden.
patrick,He's never tossing that salad.
sam, Patrick... who's this?
patrick,This is...
charlie,Uh... Charlie... Kelmeckis.
patrick,"Kelmeckis! No shit! Your sister dates Pony Tail Derek, doesn't she?"
charlie,Is that what they call him?
sam,"Awww. Leave Pony Tail Derek alone.    You put the ""ass"" in ""class,"" Patrick."
patrick,"I try, Sam. I try."
sam,"It's nice to meet you, Charlie.    I'm Sam."
patrick,"So, what's the plan, Sam? You want to go to Mary Elizabeth's house?"
sam,Can't. She got caught watering down her parent's brandy with iced tea. Let's just go to Kings.
patrick, Hey... we're going to Kings after the game if you want to come.
sam,Do you have a favorite band?
charlie,I think The Smiths are my favorite.
sam,Are you kidding!? I love The Smiths! The best breakup band ever. What's your favorite song?
charlie,Asleep. It's from Louder Than Bombs. I heard it on Pony Tail Derek's mix tape.
patrick,That works on so many levels.
charlie,I could make a copy for you.
sam,"Thanks. What about Eide's?     You love Eide's, right?"
charlie, Yeah. They're great.
patrick,"Not a band, Charlie."
sam,It's an old record store downtown.
patrick,"I used to be popular before Sam got me some good music. So, watch out, Charlie. She'll ruin your life forever."
charlie,That's okay.
patrick,Let it go!     Jesus!   It's an old joke! It's over!
sam,"So, Charlie... what are you going to do when you get out of here?"
charlie,"My Aunt Helen said I should be a writer, but I don't know what I'd write about."
sam,You could write about us.
patrick,Yeah. Call it Slut and The Falcon.      Make us solve crimes.
charlie,You guys look happy together. How long have you been boyfriend and girlfriend?  What?
sam,He's my step-brother. My mom finally left my worthless dad and married his nice dad 3 years ago.
patrick,But Sam's not bitter.     Make no mistake.
sam,Absolutely. I'm not a bulimic.      I'm a bulim-ist.
charlie,I'm sorry.     I don't know what that means.
patrick,She just really believes in bulimia.
sam, I love bulimia.
patrick,"Thanks for paying, Charlie."
charlie, No problem. Thanks for the ride. Hey... maybe I'll see you around in school?
sam," God, would you turn that down? You're going to make us deaf. Bye, Charlie."
patrick,"Bye, Charlie."
charlie,Okay.   Bye.
derek,There's nothing I can do--
candace,Do you always want to be a mama's boy?
derek,I am not a mama's boy--
candace,Yes! You are! Every time I go to your house--
derek,Shhh.   Shut u--
candace,"-- your mom says, ""Don't go to Columbia with Candace. Go to Pitt, Derek. Mommy needs you to stay at home because she"
derek,"SHUT UP, CANDACE!"
candace,And you just stand there like a little bitch dog.
little candace,"Welcome home, Aunt Helen!"
aunt helen,"Oh.   Look at you all, dressed so nice."
charlie,What are you doing?
candace,"Look, I egged him on. You saw it. He's never hit me before. I promise he'll never hit me again."
charlie,Like Aunt Helen's boyfriends?
candace,"Charlie... this is Pony Tail Derek.   I can handle him. Will you trust me? Please, don't tell mom and dad."
sam,"Oh, my God. They're playing good music."
patrick,Holy shit. They are!   They're playing good music!
sam, Living room routine?
patrick,Living room routine!
sam,"God, it's freezing."
patrick,But you wore that toasty costume. It's not like you're trying too hard to be original.
sam,"Piss off, Tennessee Tuxedo."
charlie,Are you sure it's okay that I come?
sam,"Of course. Just remember, Charlie... Bob's not paranoid."
patrick,"""He's sensitive."""
bob,Sam... that waitress from the Olive Garden is a tease. Will you marry me?
sam,Only if I have Patrick's blessing.
bob,Patrick?
patrick,"You're a hopeless stoner who attends the culinary institute. So, I'm going to have to say ""no"" on that one, but nice try. Charlie?"
bob,Touch.
patrick,Charlie... this is a party.
mary elizabeth,"Patrick, you're such a dick."
patrick,Where the hell did you go?
mary elizabeth,"The dance was a little boring, don't you think?"
patrick,You're so selfish. We looked everywhere for you. You could have told someone.
mary elizabeth,Cry me a river.
patrick,How is it that you got meaner since
mary elizabeth,Just lucky I guess.
patrick,I think you're doing something wrong.
mary elizabeth,Or something very right.
charlie,Is that Brad Hays?
alice,Yeah.    He comes here sometimes.
charlie,But he's a popular kid.
mary elizabeth," Then, what are we?"
bob,"Charlie, you look like you could use a brownie."
charlie,"Thank you. I was so hungry at the dance. I was going to go to King's, but I didn't really have any time. Thanks."
charlie,Have you guys felt this carpet?     This carpet feels so darn good.
mary elizabeth," Charlie, what do you think about high school?"
charlie,"High school? Bullshit. The cafeteria is called the Nutrition Center. And people wear their letter jackets even when it's 98 degrees out. And why do they give out letters for marching band? That's not a sport, and we all know it."
mary elizabeth,This kid is crazy.
charlie,"And Mary Elizabeth, I think you're really going to regret that haircut when you look back at old photographs.  I'm really sorry. That sounded like a compliment in my head."
mary elizabeth,"Oh, my God!"
alice,"Well, it's kind of true."
mary elizabeth,Shut up!
sam,"Bob, did you get him stoned?"
bob,"Come on, Sam. He likes it.     Just look at him."
sam,"How do you feel, Charlie?"
charlie,I just really want a milkshake.
charlie,"Sam, you have such pretty brown eyes, the kind of pretty that deserves to make a big deal about itself. You know what I mean?"
sam,"Okay, Charlie.     Let me make the milkshake."
charlie,"What a great word. Milkshake. It's like when you say your name over and over again in the mirror, and after awhile, it sounds crazy."
sam,I'm guessing you've never been high before?
charlie,"Me? No. My best friend Michael. His dad was a big drinker. So, he hated all that stuff. Parties, too."
sam,"Well, where is Michael tonight?"
charlie,"Oh, he shot himself last May."
sam,It's up the stairs.
charlie,Charlie.     Charlie.   Weird.
patrick,Charlie?
brad hays, Who is that kid?
patrick,Relax. Relax. He's a friend of mine. Stay here.
charlie,I didn't see anything.
patrick,"I know you saw something, but it's okay."
charlie,"""Like a cake."" That's what Bob said. And how you can't have 3 on a match because they would find us. And everyone laughed, but I don't know what's funny."
patrick,"Okay, Charlie, listen. I need you to promise that you're not going to say anything to anyone about me and Brad. This has to be our little secret."
charlie,Our little secret.     Agreed.
patrick,Thank you.     We'll talk later.
charlie,I look forward to that big talk.
charlie,"Isn't this the best milkshake, Alice? It's even better than the first one."
sam, I need to talk to you. Charlie just told me that his best friend shot himself. I don't think he has any friends.
patrick,Everyone.     Raise your glasses to Charlie.
charlie,What did I do?
patrick,You didn't do anything. We just want to toast our new friend.  You see things. And you understand. You're a wallflower.
patrick,"Well, we didn't think there were any cool people left to meet. So, everyone..."
sam,Welcome to the island of misfit toys.
sam,My God.    What is this song!?
patrick,Right?    I have no idea.
sam, Have you heard it before?
charlie,Never.
sam, Wait! Let's go through the tunnel!
patrick,"Sam, it's freezing."
sam,"Patrick, it's the perfect song!"
patrick,No.     Mama Patrick says no.
sam,"Patrick, it's Sam. It's Sam talking to you, I'm begging you to drive me--"
patrick, Alright! I concede!
charlie,What is she doing?
patrick,Don't worry. She does it all the time.
sam,Turn it up!
patrick,"You got it, your highness."
charlie,I feel infinite.
air supply,"I'm lying alone with my head on the phone, thinking of you 'til it hurts."
charlie,"When he was a junior, Patrick started seeing Brad on the weekends in secret. I guess it was hard, too, because Brad had to get drunk every time they fooled around."
patrick,"Whatever happened to Fae Wray? That delicate, satin draped frame? As it clung to her thigh, how I started to cry 'cause I wanted to be dressed just the same."
alice,"It's gorgeous, Craig.    What did you use?"
craig,"Color film, but black and white paper for the printing. My professor gave me an ""A,"" but for the wrong reasons. Most of them are idiots. You'll see what I mean when you get to college. How were your SAT's by the way?"
craig,"Yeah, I hope so."
charlie,Hey.    Are you okay?
sam,Yeah.   Yeah. But I got my SAT results back.   Oops.
charlie,You can take them again.
sam,"Yeah, it's just if I'm going to Penn State main campus, I have to do much better. I wish I would have studied freshman year. I was a bit of a mess."
charlie,I'll help you study for the next one.
sam,Will you?
charlie,"Yeah, of course."
sam,"Thanks, Charlie."
charlie,"Just a mix tape. No big deal. My parents have a pretty good stereo. It's all about that night in the tunnel. I couldn't find that song we were listening to, but I'm still searching for it, so--"
sam,"It's okay. These are great.   You have really good taste, Charlie."
charlie,Really?
sam,Yeah. Way better than me as a freshman.
charlie,No.
sam,"Yeah, I did. But then I heard this old song. Pearly Dew Drops Drop. And I thought someday I would be at a party in college or something. And I'd look up and see this person across the room. And from that moment, I'd know everything was going to be okay. You know what I mean?"
charlie, Yeah.
alice,"So, what do you think?"
patrick,I don't know.
alice,I hope it works out. Craig would be a big step up from her last boyfriend.
mary elizabeth,"No, shit.     Who could forget Mr. Car Wash Loser?"
patrick,I just hope she stops playing dumb with these guys. I keep telling her... don't make yourself small. You can't save anybody.
craig,"Man, your mix is morbidly sad, kid. How about something a little more upbeat?"
charlie,Yeah.
alice,"Don't you write poetry, Craig?"
craig,No.     Poetry writes me.   You know?
bill,Wow.    That was fast.   You want another one?
charlie,Mr. Anderson... can I ask you something?
bill,Yeah.
charlie,Why do nice people choose the wrong people to date?
bill,Are we talking about anyone specific?
charlie,Can we make them know they deserve more?
bill,We can try.
sam,"Hey, Charlie."
charlie,"Hey, Sam. I didn't see you come in.     You want to work on probabilities and statistics?"
charlie,"Hey, dad.    Can I have 30 dollars?"
father, 20 dollars? What do you want 10 dollars for?
charlie,Sam is doing secret santa. It's her favorite thing in the world. Please.
father,Have fun.
charlie,Thanks.
bill,"Charlie... this was my favorite book growing up. This is my copy, but I want you to have it."
charlie,Thanks.
bill,Have a great Christmas break.
charlie,"You too, Mr. Anderson."
patrick,"If you fail me, you get me next semester."
patrick,"Woo! C Minus! It's over! It's over! Ladies and gentlemen, I am below average!"
sam,Below average!
sam,"No more applications!   No more SAT's! Thank you, Charlie!"
mary elizabeth,"Multiple pairs of blue jeans. Wow. This is a really tough one, but I'm going to have to guess... Alice."
patrick,Impossible!
mary elizabeth,I'm so touched.
charlie,Where's Craig?
sam,He went home to Connecticut.    He'll be back for New Year's Eve.
charlie,I'm sorry we won't be seeing him tonight.
sam,"Alright, big brother by 3 weeks.    Who's your secret santa?"
patrick,"I'll tell you, Sam. This one's tough. I have received a harmonica, a magnetic poetry set, a book about Harvey Milk, and a mix with the song ""Asleep"" on it... twice."
sam,"Alright, Charlie... it's your turn."
charlie,"Okay. Uh, I have received socks, pants, a shirt, and a belt. I was ordered to wear them all tonight. So, I'm guessing my secret santa is Mary Elizabeth."
patrick,"Huh.   Now, why do you say that?"
charlie,I don't know. She bosses people around sometimes.
mary elizabeth,What the hell is wrong with you?
charlie,Sorry.
patrick,"Well, you'll be surprised to know that your secret santa is actually... me."
charlie,You got me clothes?     Why?
patrick,Because all the great writers used to wear great suits. Your last present is on a towel rack in the bathroom. Delve into our facilities. Emerge a star.
charlie,Can you hand these out while I'm gone?
mary elizabeth,"Wait a second. There's only secret santa presents. There are rules, Charlie."
patrick,"Mary Elizabeth, why are you trying to eat Christmas? Hand them out, Sam."
alice,"""Alice, I know you'll get into NYU."""
mary elizabeth,"40 dollars.  ""To print Punk Rocky in color next time."""
bob,He knows me. He really knows me.
sam,"Come on out, Charlie."
patrick,Yeah!   What a display of man I have ever seen!
charlie,Where are we going?
sam,It's a surprise.
charlie,Is this your room?    It's so cool.
sam,Thanks.
charlie,You got me a present?
sam,With all that help on my Penn State application? Of course I did. Open it.
charlie,I don't know what to say.
sam,You don't have to say anything.
charlie,That's okay. I'm just sorry you have to go back and visit your dad.
sam,"I'm in such a great mood, I don't think even he could ruin it. I feel like I'm finally doing good."
charlie,You are.
sam,"Me? What about you? When I met you, you were this scared freshman. And look at you in that suit. You're like a sexy English school boy. I saw Mary Elizabeth checking you out."
charlie, No.
sam,Innocent. Worst kind of guys. Never see you coming. And parents love you. That's like... extra danger.
charlie,"Well, it hasn't worked so far."
sam,Come on. You've never had a girlfriend? Not even a 2nd grade valentine?
charlie,No.   What about you?
sam,Have I ever kissed a girl?
charlie, No! Your first kiss...
sam,My first kiss? I was 11. His name was Robert. He would come over to the house all the time.
charlie,Was he your first boyfriend?
sam,He was my dad's boss.
charlie,It's true.     You can do it.
charlie,"My Aunt... she had that same thing done to her, too. And she turned her life around."
sam,She must have been great.
charlie,She was my favorite person in the world... until now.
sam,"Charlie, I know that you know I like Craig. But I want to forget that for a minute. Okay? I just want to make sure that the first person who kisses you loves you. Okay?"
charlie,"I love you, too."
gang,"""Merry Christmas!"" ""Good luck at your dad's!"" ""See you at New Year's!"""
charlie,Have a good time at your mom's.
patrick,"Thanks. And Charlie... since you were born on Christmas Eve, I figure you don't get a lot of birthday presents. So, I thought you should have my clock. From the heart."
charlie,"Thank you, Patrick."
patrick,I love you guys!
father,Hey!   Look who's here!
chris,"Come here, little sister."
candace,"Hey, Chris."
chris,"Ma, you look so thin!"
mother,10 pounds... Weight Watchers.
chris,Charlie...
mother,"Make a wish, honey."
aunt helen,"Can you see it, Charlie? The luminaria is a landing strip for Santa Claus."
charlie,Hey.
chris,"Hey. God, I missed mom's cooking.        You have no idea how good you have it.       I'm actually beginning to hate pizza."
charlie,How are you liking school?
chris,Not bad.    I'm no brainiac like you or Candace.    But I'm doing okay.
charlie,Okay?    You're playing in a Bowl Game.
chris,"How are you feeling, Charlie?"
charlie,Good.
chris,You know what I mean.      Is it bad tonight?
charlie,No.
chris,No?
charlie,"I'm not picturing things anymore. And when I do, I can just shut it off."
chris," now. And maybe if it does get bad again, you can just talk to them, yeah?"
charlie,Yeah. Especially Sam. I'm going to ask her out at New Years. I think the time is right now.
charlie,How long does this take to work?
sam,"Shoveling snow, huh?"
charlie,"I have to get this driveway clean. Then, I have to congratulate you for being happy because you deserve it."
sam,You said that an hour ago.
charlie,"Was that tonight? God. I was looking at this tree, but it was a dragon, and then"
sam,"Okay, Charlie. Don't freak out. Just give me the shovel. Calm down. Look up."
charlie,"Sam, you ever think that if people knew how crazy you really were, no one would ever talk to you?"
sam,"All the time. So, you want to put on these glasses? They'll protect you."
aunt helen,"It'll be our little secret, all right?"
patrick,7-6-5-4-3-2-1. Happy New Year!
policeman,Did your older friends pressure you?
charlie,"No one pressured me into anything. I would never do drugs, officer. Never."
policeman,"Then, how did you happen to be passed out on the ground at 6 in the morning?"
charlie,"Well, um... I was really tired, and uh... I was feeling feverish. So, I went outside for a walk, just to get some cold air. And I started seeing things. So, I passed out."
mother," You're seeing things again, Charlie?"
charlie," Not, uh... Not really."
charlie,It was a Christmas present.
charlie,Did you have fun on your break?
bill,"More fun than you're going to have today, Sinatra."
mary elizabeth,Well what are we supposed to do?     We're going on in 10 minutes!
charlie,But they said in health class--
brad hays,They say that about LSD to scare you.
charlie,Are you sure?
brad hays,"Charlie, you're fine, man."
mary elizabeth,"Guys, we have an emergency. Craig flaked out on us again. I need a Rocky. Brad?"
brad hays, No way. There are people out here.
mary elizabeth,Charlie... take off your clothes.
sam, So if anything grows while you pose. I'll oil you up and drop you down. And that's just one small fraction of the main attraction. You need a friendly hand. And I need action!
charlie,Maybe I could join the cast as an alternate or something?
mary elizabeth,"We're filled up now, but they'll need people after we leave for college. I could put in a good word for you."
charlie,That'd be great. Thanks.
mary elizabeth,Charlie... have you heard of the Sadie Hawkins dance?
charlie,The one where the girl asks the guy.
mary elizabeth,"Yeah. Well, obviously, it's completely stupid and sexist. It's like, ""Hey, thanks for the crumb."" And normally, I'd just blow it off because school dances suck torture. But, you know, it's my last year, and... would you maybe want to go with me?"
charlie,You want to go with me?
mary elizabeth,"I'm sick of macho guys. And you looked really cute in your costume. So, what do you say?"
mother,You must be Mary Elizabeth.    It's so good to meet you.
mary elizabeth,"You, too, Mrs. Kelmeckis."
father, Charlie tells me you're a Buddhist.
father,"OK, a little closer together. That looks nice. Buddhist, I need you to smile a little bit more. There you go. Nice."
charlie,Are you having a good time?
sam,Not really. How about you?
charlie,"I don't know. This is my first date, so I don't know what to compare it to."
sam,Don't worry. You're doing fine.
charlie,I'm sorry Craig didn't come.
sam,Yeah. He said he didn't want to go to some stupid high school dance. Can't say I blame him.
charlie,"I don't know. If you like it, he should come."
sam,"Thanks, Charlie. Have a beautiful first date. You deserve it."
charlie,I'll try not to make you too jealous.
mary elizabeth,"Mmmm.   Now, let it breathe."
charlie,This is sure a nice house.
mary elizabeth,Thanks.
charlie,This merlot is really fancy.
mary elizabeth,"Yeah. My dad collects wine, but he doesn't drink. That's weird, isn't it?"
charlie,I guess.    Where are your parents?
mary elizabeth,Their club is hosting a cotillion or something racist. They'll be gone all night.
charlie,That's sure a nice fire.
mary elizabeth,"Yeah. After I'm done being a lobbyist, I want to move to a house like this in Cape Cod. That sounds nice, doesn't it?"
charlie,Yeah.
mary elizabeth,Your heart is beating really fast.
charlie,Is it?
mary elizabeth,"Here, feel."
charlie,Uh-huh?
mary elizabeth,Do you like me?
charlie,Uh-huh.
mary elizabeth,You know what I mean.
charlie,I think so.
mary elizabeth,Don't be nervous.
mary elizabeth,Charlie...
charlie,Yeah.
mary elizabeth,I can't believe it. You of all people. I just can't believe you're my boyfriend.
mary elizabeth,See you Monday.
mary elizabeth,"We're literally making out, and I'm in my bra. Hello! And the front door opens. It's my parents! I'm scrambling to get my dress on. It was crazy. Right, babe?"
mary elizabeth,Can you believe it's almost our two week anniversary?
charlie,I know.
mary elizabeth, Your first foreign film.
mary elizabeth,Vegans don't eat butter.
mary elizabeth,"Walden? I read it in 7th grade.    I would have called it ""On Boring Pond."""
mother,"She's on the phone right now? Charlie, you have to break up with her."
charlie,I can do that?
father,For Christ's sake... I need to use the phone!
patrick,Who are you talking to?
bob,I dare you to kiss Alice.
patrick," Get ready, breeder."
craig,Mary Elizabeth? Samantha told me that you got into Harvard. Congratulations.
mary elizabeth,Thank you.  But I forgive you.
craig, Don't worry about Penn State.   You're just wait-listed.
patrick,"Excuse me, everyone, but you're missing some hot ""fag on goth"" action."
charlie,Truth.
patrick,How is your first relationship going?
charlie,"It's so bad that I keep fantasizing that one of us is dying of cancer, so I don't have to break up with her."
patrick,Charlie?   Truth or dare?
charlie,Dare.
patrick,I dare you to kiss the prettiest girl in the room on the lips. Notice I charitably said girl and not person because let's face it... I'd smoke all you bitches.
charlie,"Mary Elizabeth, I'm sorry.     I'm--"
sam,What the hell is wrong with you?
patrick,Trust me.    You don't want to go back there.
charlie,"But, I... I'm sorry... I didn't mean to do anything."
patrick,"I know you didn't, but look... I hate to be the one to break this, but there's history with Mary Elizabeth and Sam. Other guys. Things that have nothing to do with you. But... it's best if you stay away for awhile."
charlie, Oh. Okay. How long do you think?
mother,We're going to be late for Easter Mass.
charlie,I'll... I'll be there in a minute.
priest,Our Father who art in Heaven. Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come--
priest,Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread.
priest,And forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us--
priest,And lead us not into temptation.   But deliver us from--
charlie,I know. I just feel really bad about what I did. I just get so messed up inside like I'm - not there or something.
charlie,I know. I'm sorry. I just.     We've all become such good friends--
charlie,Oh. Yeah. I mean I don't want to do anything to ruin our--
charlie,"Okay.   I will. Goodbye, Mar--"
charlie,Something's wrong with me--
bob,Don't worry about it.   Hey... you hear from Patrick?
charlie,No.   He told me to stay away.
bob,Oh... you don't know?
charlie, Why? Why? What happened?
bob,Brad's father caught them together.
charlie,Are you okay?
patrick,"Not now, Charlie. I'm sorry."
nose tackle,"Oops.   Sorry, Nothing."
patrick,You going to do something?
brad hays,What are you talking about?
patrick,Your pet ape just tripped me.    Are you going to say something?
brad hays,Why would I?
patrick,You know why.
brad hays,"This is pathetic, man.    Your fixation on me."
patrick,Do you want your friends to know how you got those bruises? Really?
brad hays,I got jumped in a parking lot.
patrick,Where? In Schenley Park? Do they know about Schenley Park?  Do you guys know about Schenley Park?
brad hays,I don't know what kind of sick shit you're trying to pull.  But you better walk away now... Nothing.
patrick,Fine.   Say hi to your dad for me.
brad hays,Whatever... faggot.
patrick,What did you call me?
brad hays,I called you a faggo--
patrick,Say that shit again!    Say that shit again!
mary elizabeth,It's Patrick!
sam,No!   No!
charlie," If you touch my friends again, I'll blind you."
brad hays,Charlie?
charlie,Yeah?
brad hays,Thanks for stopping them.
charlie,"Sure, Brad."
sam,"How you doing, Charlie?"
charlie,"I don't know. I keep trying, but... I can't really remember what I did."
sam,Do you want me to tell you?
charlie, Yeah.
sam,You saved my brother.     That's what you did.
charlie,"So, you're not scared of me?"
sam,No.
charlie,And can we be friends again?
sam,Of course.
mary elizabeth,I'm dating Peter now.
charlie,I'm just glad you're happy.
mary elizabeth,Okay.
patrick,"Hey Craig, Sam will be down soon."
mary elizabeth,We're going to miss the movie.
craig,"Yeah, I'll go put some pep in her step."
patrick,Hey... you wanna get out of here?
charlie,"Sure, Patrick."
patrick,"Oh, my God. My life is officially an after school special. Son of a bitch!"
charlie, It kind of is. It so is.
patrick,"So, you ever hear the one about Lily Miller?"
charlie,I don't know.
patrick,Really? I thought your brother would have told you. It's a classic.
charlie,Maybe.
patrick,"So, Lily comes here with this guy Parker. And this was going to be the night they were going to lose their virginity. So, she did it really proper. She packed a picnic. Stole a bottle of wine. Everything was perfect, and they're just about to 'do it' when they realize they forgot the condoms. So, what do you think happened?"
charlie,I don't know.
patrick,They did it with one of the sandwich bags.
charlie,Ew!   That's disgusting!
patrick,Yes! It is! Let's keep the train rolling. Suburban legends. Charlie!
charlie,Uh. Well... there was this girl named Second Base Stace. She had boobs in the 4th grade--
patrick,Mosquito bites. Promising.     Go.
charlie,And she let some of the boys feel them.
patrick,That's your suburban legend?     Did you at least cop a feel?
charlie,No.
patrick,"Of course not. You went home, listened to ""Asleep,"" wrote a poem about her self- esteem--"
charlie,Fine!    Okay. Your turn.
patrick,"Yeah, I've got one. Well, there was this one guy. Queer as a 3 dollar bill. Guy's father didn't know about his son. So, he comes down into the basement one night when he's supposed to be out of town. Catches his son with another boy. So, he starts beating him. But not like the slap kind. Like the real kind. And the boyfriend says, ""Stop. You're killing him."" And the son just yells ""Get out."" And eventually the boyfriend just did."
charlie,I don't know.
patrick,"Forget it. I'm free now, right? I could meet the love of my life any second now. Things will be different now, and that's good. I just need to meet a good guy."
charlie,Yeah.
patrick,I'm sorry.
charlie,It's alright.
patrick," She got in, Charlie."
charlie,"Especially because ever since I blacked out in the cafeteria, it's been getting worse. And I can't turn it off this time."
bill,"Guys, you want to pass your copies of Gatsby up to the front please? And I know it's the last day, but if we could just keep it to a dull roar, I'd appreciate it."
bill,Last day.
charlie,"Yeah. So, uh, I know it's none of my business, but have you decided... are you going to New York?"
bill,"Well, my wife and I like it here, and I think I might be better at teaching than writing."
charlie,Yeah.   Yeah.
bill,I think you could write one of them one day.
charlie, Really?
bill,I do.
charlie,You're the best teacher I ever had.
bill,Thank you.
all,1!
patrick,"Oh, Charlie's here! Guys, group photo! We should all take a group photo. Get against the railing and try to look suave!"
sam,"Are these all your books, Charlie?"
sam,Thanks for staying up with me.
charlie,Sure. My brother said Penn State has a restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner. You have to get a grilled stickie on your first night. It's a tradition.
sam,That sounds like fun.
charlie,"Yeah. Pretty soon, you'll have a whole new group of friends, and you won't even think about this place anymore."
sam,"Yes, I will."
charlie,Yeah?
sam,"He said he was sorry, and that I was right to break up with him. But I'm driving away, and I just felt so small. Just asking myself why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat us like we're nothing?"
charlie,We accept the love we think we deserve.
sam,"Then, why didn't you ever ask me out?"
charlie,"I, uh, I just didn't think you wanted that."
sam,"Well, what did you want?"
charlie,I just want you to be happy.
sam,"Don't you get it, Charlie? I can't feel that. It's really sweet and everything, but you can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. I don't want to be somebody's crush. I want people to like the real me."
charlie,"I know who you are, Sam."
sam,"What's wrong, Charlie?"
charlie,"Oh, ah... nothing."
sam,I'll call all the time.
mary elizabeth,Promise.
sam,And we'll all see each other in New York.
sam's mom,"Come on, Sam."
sam,"What's wrong, Charlie?"
aunt helen,Don't wake your sister.
aunt helen,"It'll be our little secret, okay?"
aunt helen,"Look, Charlie. She's fast asleep."
aunt helen,Don't wake your sister.
charlie,Stop crying.
charlie,Stop crying.
candace's friend,Candace... your brother's on the phone.
candace,Hello.
candace,Charlie?
charlie,"Sam and Patrick left, and um, I just can't stop thinking something."
candace,What?
charlie,"Candace, I killed Aunt Helen, didn't I? She died getting my birthday present, so I guess I killed her, right? I've tried to stop thinking that, but I can't. She keeps driving away and dying over and over."
candace,Call the police and send them to my house.
charlie,And I can't stop her.   I'm crazy again.
candace,"No, Charlie, listen to me. Mom and dad are going to be home with Chris any second."
charlie,"I was just thinking... what if I wanted her to die, Candace?"
candace,What?    Charlie... Charlie!
charlie,Where am I?
charlie,You have to let me go.    My dad can't afford it.
charlie,No. I saw them when I was little. And I don't want to be a Mayview kid. Just tell me how to stop it.
charlie,Seeing it. All their lives. All the time. Just... how do you stop seeing it?
charlie,There is so much pain.    And I don't know how to not notice it.
charlie,No! Not me. It's them. It's everyone. It never stops. Do you understand?
charlie,What about her?
charlie,"Yes, she had a terrible life.   But... I mean, what am I..."
charlie,I don't care.
charlie,She was... insane.
charlie,Okay.
charlie,"I, uh... I remember leaving Sam's house, and walking home..."
mother,Honey?
father,God bless this food that we are about to receive. We thank You for this bounty in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
charlie,"How do you think the Penguins are going to do this year, dad?"
father,God damn Penguins. I think they're allergic to God damn defense.
charlie,What do the players call a puck again?
father,A biscuit.
candace,"Are you sure it's not a ""God damn biscuit?"""
father,You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.
patrick,Can Charlie come out and play?
sam,"That first night, I had grilled stickies. It was so good. You have to visit in the Fall. We'll have some. Okay?"
charlie,Definitely.
patrick,"Sorry, Sam. Charlie has a breakdown scheduled for October."
sam,"Well, can I tell you something? I've been away for two months. It's another world. And it gets better.  And my roommate Katie has the best taste in music."
