Speaker,Dialogue
officer,Take your time.  Take a good look.
safeway cashier,"Ah, a-are you sure they can't see us?"
officer,"Two-way mirror, ma'am."
factory worker,"But they're trained killers.  A guy at the plant says, ""In 'Nam they could smell ya!"""
officer,"This is the United States of America, Sir."
diane," I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am, but is this going to take long?  It's game night."
officer, Picture in three --
fbi agent,...and testifying in such a case is a serious matter.  Should you decide your testimony would jeopardize your personal safety.
lisa,"Look, ""Sipowitz"", I said I'd tell you everything - I was just hoping to finish up before menopause kicks in."
diane," Morning, sunshine.  Remember, these are the best days of your life."
diane,"Hey, Bruce!  You look cute..."
bruce, Tommy Hilfiger.  I'm hoping fourth year's a charm.
lisa,"Outta my way, fag.  I'm up."
diane,Lisa?...  Is-is that you?
lisa, I lost a little weight.
lisa,"Now, the squad as a whole?  They're closer than Carolina cousins.  Some people say they're, like, lezbos or something.  But that's mostly just the yag-offs in band..."
cleo,"Dreams?  You mean, like, where I'm in Conan's all leather apartment - I don't know if he has one, that's why it's a dream - and suddenly we're buck-naked and all oiled up.  I don't know where the oil comes from - again, that's why it's a dream."
kansas,Son-of-a-blue-balled-bitch!  I always get this one.
diane,"Today, we're going to cheer loud, jump high, and look pretty because --"
diane,Now let's get going - because nobody ever got ahead by sitting on their behind!
principal smith," ... and if you are approached to buy drugs, let someone you trust know.  If you are thinking of harming yourself or others, let someone know.  If it burns when you urinate, have milky seepage or are being touched by an uncle - let someone know..."
diane,Jack Bartlett... Jack Bart-lett... Jack Bar-t-lett.
diane,... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
hannah," I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."
kansas,"Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you."
hannah," Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore."
kansas,"Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with ""at church camp"" ain't leading to the big ""O."""
cleo,That's not true.  Those pictures of Christ - all sweaty and bare-chested on the cross - always kinda made me hot.
kansas,"Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying."
diane,"Well, I want to know what happened --"
hannah,"Okay, one night, around sunset, I went horseback riding with the nuns.  They went every night.  And, well, we're trotting pretty hard, y'know?  The hard leather saddle, pounding between my legs..."
cleo,I just got a little squishy...
hannah,"All of a sudden, I feel... I feel... I feel just super alive...  ""down there.""  I swear I thought it was the second coming."
kansas,Nope.  Sounds more like the first.
diane," I'll just ask the question myself... ""Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"""
jack,Yeah.
jack,Never opened her up.
jack,Who was the girl who kicked me in the head yesterday?
geeky guy,"As the A.V. Club candidate, I think, for the first time in fifty years, we should say --  NO to a football player as king!"
jack,"Whoa...Thanks, uh - WOW.  Uh, hey, alright...okay, uh --"
jack,"Guys!  Hey, guys!  Shut up a minute."
female voices,"We love you, Jack!"
jack,"Hey, well, I love you lunch ladies!"
deedee,"Well, there's a Christmas card."
dennis,"Come in, come in..."
jack,"I'm on it, Mr. Weston."
deedee,"Oh - say, where're my manners.  I'm DeeDee - you can remember me because of my double ""D's."""
dennis,"And I'm Diane's Dad, Dennis.  Do not try that after one of my Screwdrivers!"
deedee, Whoooo - now who wants some pigs-in-a blanket?
diane,"Hi, Jack."
jack,"Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight."
jack,Hold on a minute.  Hold on.  I have an announcement.
deedee,"Oh, oh, mother of the bride - I'm allowed!"
diane,But not before... I have our baby.
diane,"... so when your dad said, ""I never want to see your ""f-'in' faces again!"" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?"
jack,I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
diane,"Well, if I had to guess...  Jack, do you know what I see here?"
jack,Spit from your dad?
diane," I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt."
jack,Yeah.
diane,"So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty ""stinky"" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this."
jack,Y'think?
diane,I sure do.
jack," Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head."
diane," Oh, Jack..."
diane, No thanks - don't need one.
cleo,Holy shit.
lucy,You just became a statistic!
kansas, Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!
hannah,But you're not married.
cleo,"Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!"
kansas,"Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?"
hannah," What?!  No!  Not an abortion!  My church can arrange for you to go to Oregon and take care of a ""sick aunt"" for nine months.  Then they put your baby good home and you come back - a little dazed and puffy - but everything's fine!  Oh please, Di, don't be a whore and a murderer!"
jack,"Hey, guys?  Uh, I got Diane pregnant."
hannah,"I-I didn't mean to say ""whore,"" Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head."
diane,"I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself ""with child,"" unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... ""Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby."" The great one..."
kansas,"We're here for you, Diane."
loan officer,I'm sorry.
diane,"What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records..."
loan officer,Let me explain something...
diane,"No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!"
loan officer,"Uh, yes.  Yes you did."
jack,"Diane.  Hold on a minute.  I think I know where this is going.  I'm willing to put up the papers for my Mustang - she's got a few miles on her, but she looks great."
loan officer,"I'm sure, son, but --"
jack,Okay!  Stop twisting my arm!  I'll throw in the speakers.
loan officer,"Look, kids, why don't you just have your parents come i n and get a loan?  Then they could give you the money."
diane," With all due respect, Jack and Diane Bartlett..."
loan officer,Sorry.  My hands are tied.
diane,"Well... it's a little more than we wanted to spend, but we'll take it!"
apartment manager,"Fine.  Just remember, I manage the building.  I don't, like, own it or fix it.  So, like, I don't care if shit breaks.  All I care is that the rent is shoved under my door on the first.  Oh, and if there's, like, packages outside my door?  Leave 'em the hell alone."
jack, Don't get the Filet-O-Fish - the fry cook picks his ass.
jack," Two Taco Grannnndes, one burrrrrrito, large ta-co chips and guacamooooooole..."
jack," We don't really have fried rats in the buckets - I know, I checked."
jack," That'll be...uh, thirty five cents, please."
jack, Welcome to Dinkie's Donuts.
jack,"Dinkie is a bad, bad man..."
jack," Y'know what?  I'll save you the time. I'm not going to lie.  I don't believe in it.  If you pick your ass - I'm going to tell people.  I have no idea how to run your registers.  And, if any of you are hard core drinkers and like to throw knives, well, I'm outta here right now."
ted,"Uh, are, uh, you-you're Jack Bartlett, right?"
jack,Yeah.
ted,"You'd be, like, hangin' out with us every night after school, right?"
jack,"Yeah - well, after football practice."
chris, Football practice - fantasmic.
ted,You're hired!
jack,I'm on top of the world!
diane,"Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two."
jack," But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby."
diane,Jack...
jack," If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?"
diane, Trix...
jack,Me too!  Will it ever end?!  I love this lady!
diane,"Jack, I think I should get a job."
jack, But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
diane,"I know, but that was before."
jack,Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
jack,"I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!"
diane, Mmm-hmmm...
building manager,"I need a place to keep this.  Anyone asks, what d'ya know?  You don't know shit."
heckler,"Hey, Bartlett, pick up your skirt when you run!"
kansas," Run, you bastard, run!  She's hormonal!!"
jack,"...she's in my hands, right?  Moist to the touch.  It's at that moment I think I control her - she's mine.  But it's a false illusion, like in ""Backdraft.""  No man controls fire!  She's ready, I'm ready, she's ready, I yell, ""One-fifty four, forty eight."""
cleo,"I can't believe they have the ""Top Ten Alternatives to Sex for You and Your Boyfriend"" and ""watching each other masturbate"" isn't even listed!"
lucy," Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas."
kansas,More proof God's a guy...
lucy,...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
kansas,Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
chris,"Jack, c'mon, you promised."
jack," Okay, one question."
ted," Oh, me-me-me, mine's great."
chris,"Proceed, Dungeon Master Quan."
ted,"Okay.  Jack, y'know how you and Diane... slept together?  ""sleep together,"" but you still sleep together, don't you ever get, like, just, super horny?  If so, how horny? I'll be quiet now so I can listen to your answer."
lisa," Yeah, Jack - I'd love to hear your answer."
jack,The answer's easy...  I'm gonna be a dad!  Dads don't get horny.
diane, That was a weird one.
cleo,Another sex dream?
diane,Wayne Gretzky.
kansas,Hat-trick?
diane, He is the Great One...
lisa, Jack?  Oh Jack...
ted,Can I help you?
lisa, Get your loser ass away from me!
jack, Diane?
lucy,"Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!"
diane, No...I've been pregnant.
cleo,"Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week."
diane, Everything's fine.  I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down.
hannah,You want us to help you pick up?
diane, Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
kansas,And we have our first pregnancy mood swing.  All that's left is --
cleo,"Did you guys hear that in China - or one a those places that makes the really cheap silk shoes and kids are super smart - that as a reward for good grades, mothers get their kids hookers to blow 'em?"
hannah,No.
cleo,Huh.  Musta been a dream.
diane,"I'm sorry to keep asking this, but are you guys sure I'm not fat?"
kansas,"Uh, ""no""... You're not fat."
diane,You sure I'm not fat?
lucy, What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
diane, No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
lucy,"Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say."
diane,You sure?
lucy,Positive.
diane,"""Positive"" you're sure I'm not fat or ""positive"" I'm..."
lucy,"Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a ""pregnancy insanity.""  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --"
diane," Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, ""Dreams can come true.""  Right?"
kansas,"Stop, you're gonna make me cry."
diane,"And if the O.J. trial taught us anything, it taught us that in America, you can cut off someone's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money.  Your mom only shot a guy..."
hannah,"Or, I could get my own horse..."
diane,"Or that!  Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby.  I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand.  I could open that safe in my sleep!"
kansas,I'm in.
lucy,Stop it!  This is crazy!
cleo,"I'm in, too."
lucy,Cleo!
cleo,Kansas is right.  We're like sisters -- we're closer than sisters.  And you don't turn your back on family.
diane,"C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time."
lucy,And they get caught!
diane,That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
cleo,And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
lucy,Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
cleo, Conan went to Harvard.
kansas, Shut up.
diane,"Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?"
lucy,No.
diane,If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
lucy,... I don't know.  Probably not.
diane,So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
lucy,Well...
diane,Of course - of course!  Hands in...
geeky guy,... I feel utterly abandoned in a place that values physical prowess over mental acuity.  I can't wait for all this to change once we get in the real world...
lisa,"... I do!  I totally marry Prince William even if he was gay.  I mean, in England all guys are kinda gay anyway. Even cigarettes are fags over there..."
cleo,"...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --"
diane,"Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?"
cleo," Well...uh...they, y'know, uh... They had nicknames."
lucy,"...Page one is a plot summary of ""Heat."" Two has my character summaries.  Three is my overall critique and on four through ten, you'll find my Nexus search of all prior analysis of this film..."
diane,"Uh, Jack - look, I can explain..."
jack,"Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these."
ted,"Uh, Cleo...would you just say my name?"
hannah,"...so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes..."
kansas,Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
hannah,"I'm only allowed ""G"" movies."
kansas," Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched ""Dog Day Afternoon!"""
husband,"Excuse me, could you please keep your voice down?  We're not introducing anger into the womb."
kansas, Well how'd you like me to introduce my foot into your ass?
diane,Kansas!
kansas," I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --"
hannah,"Those of us who have parents, know that they have rules because they care!"
kansas,You sure you wanna go there?
hannah, Uh...maybe?
kansas,"'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say ""Fat-assed lesbian!"""
nurse,Diane Weston?
cleo,"Di, we're sorry.  We..."
diane,"It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!"
kansas,"Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves."
hannah,"Look, maybe I can watch a PG movie... I'll just say I'm counting dirty words for Sunday School."
diane,"That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way."
cleo,Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
lucy,It's twins!!
diane,"Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!"
kansas," Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!"
kansas,Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
kansas,You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
kansas,They could kill you.
kansas,I don't hate you.  I need your help.
kansas,Your help.
kansas," Okay, you can't tell anybody."
kansas,My best friend got pregnant.
kansas,"I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank."
kansas,"I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it."
kansas,"Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, ""P.S. My mom's a dyke"" too?"
kansas,"Hey, don't ""mouthy shit"" me - I'm outta here."
diane,"Well, thank you.  They're actually uniforms - we're cheerleaders."
diane,Excuse us.
kansas,"Same time tomorrow - we have a visit with our favorite ""aunts."""
mink,"Robbin' a bank is like pullin' a trick. You gotta stay in control, know how far you'll go for the dough and always put the rubber on yourself... Well, y'know what I mean.  And you gotta do it the day after Christmas."
kansas,Why?
mink,"Banks never have a holiday pick up, so vaults are full.  Besides, everyone's at home eatin' left-overs and beatin' their kids."
cleo,"Really?  You were cell mates with her? Oh my G-d, she was my hero!  Did she tell you what Letterman's house was like?"
lucy,"And ""gats"" are..."
lucy,"And you're called ""Itchy"" because..."
jack," Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!"
diane,"That was gas, Sweetie."
jack,Oh... What are you working on?
diane,Jus some girlie things for the squad.
kansas,Whoever gets out alive -- have the authorities to check in the crawl space.
diane,"Kansas, you should never judge a book by its cover."
hank,Yeah?
diane, I guess there's an exception to every rule.
kansas,"You're the ""Terminator?"""
hank,You come in here to bust my balls?  I kill bugs for a livin'.  G-d already beat ya to it.
diane,"NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh..."
kansas,"We were told you could ""fix us up."""
hank, Really...
lucy,"Yeah.  ""Itchy"" sent us."
hank,"She did, did she?  How is the old girl?"
lucy,Definitely old.
hank," That's Itchy, alright.  How many y'need?"
diane,"Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it."
hank,Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
diane,Ammo?
hank,Bullets.
diane,"Bullets?  No bullets!  Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full.  You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it."
hank,Right.  That'll be fifteen hundred - cash.
cleo,What?!
kansas,You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
diane,"Hey, hey, hey.  C'mon you guys.  Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow.  Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars."
hank,"Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash.  Take it or leave it."
hannah,What kind of deal would you make if I said we were going to the police and tell them you're selling illegal guns... to minors!  To girl minors!
hank, I'd just hafta kiiiiiill you.
diane,"Well, okay then.  It was a pleasure meeting you.  Take care, let's go you guys."
hank,Hold on!
lucy,"Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!"
hank,Maybe we can make a deal.
kansas,"Look, we're not gonna trade sex for guns.  Unless Cleo..."
hank,My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
diane,You're kidding.
hank,Fern!  C'mere!  She's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose.
diane,We'll be right back.
diane,"Sorry, we had our first basketball game - went into overtime... Excuse us.  Sorry."
instructor," May I continue, ladies?"
kansas,Sure.  Unless it's hard for you to talk with that stick up your ass.
cleo,Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
diane, Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
jack," Hey-hey, let's remember our focal point!"
chris, AHHHHH!
jack,"C'mon, don't stop now.  We're gonna make it, baby."
lisa,What a sad waste of a man.
lucy," Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four."
diane," Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee..."
kansas,Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
hannah,"Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month."
lucy,"Look, you guys, three strikes we're out. Let's face it.  It's time to abort!"
kansas,Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
diane,"Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?"
cleo,"Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross."
diane,My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
cleo,"I personally think of how Conan started as a writer, then became a..."
lucy," -- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo."
diane,"That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!"
lucy,What the hell kind of food are they serving us that they can turn a profit on two hundred bucks!?
diane,"Uh, Fern?"
fern, Yeah?
diane,"No more filling tanks before practice, okay?"
fern,'Kay.
cleo,I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
kansas,You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
diane,Ready?
kansas,What the hell?
diane,Oh no...
kansas,He Ikea'd us.
lucy,Okay.  How many signs do we need?  We're not supposed to do this...
hannah,Maybe Lucy's right.  Maybe this is a sign.
kansas,Screw Lucy!
kansas,"Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad."
kansas,"Oh yeah, you caught us..."
kansas,Thanks!  That'd be great.
kansas,"Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke."
kansas,"I'll get them before ""Touched by an Angel,"" don't worry."
cleo, This is great.  What do we do?  Threaten people with a trunk full of parts?
fern,"I'm sorry, you guys.  But when you're dealin' with South American Rebels, you kinda gotta take what you can get."
diane,"Excuse me, but do you guys know what I don't see here?"
bruce," Please join our ""A"" and ""B"" squad cheerleaders in a salute to winter sports!"
bruce," ""I....see...girls swimming..."""
kansas, Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
cleo,I just pulled and it - it came off.
kansas,This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
cleo," Look, it's really not my fault."
kansas,"Hey!  Rule number one - never take off the mask!  Y'hear me!  No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK!"
cleo,"Sorry, Kansas..."
kansas," NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!"
cleo,Oh for Chrissakes...  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
kansas," Well, use your head, ""Stalker Betty."""
diane,"Bettys, stop it!  ""The best squad is one that hopes for the best and prepares for the worst.""  National High School Cheerleading Association letterhead. Now, let's give a hands in..."
nixon, SHH!  It's me.
diane,Lucy?
kansas,What the hell do you want?
lucy,I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
hannah, Oh no!  You committed the ultimate sin - you left our squad to be with a guy. And - and that guy is the Devil himself - 'cause only the Devil would turn you against your sisters!
diane," Hannah, you really have to stop taking that church stuff so literally."
kansas," Okay, down on the ground!  Now!"
safeway cashier,"Uh, y-y-y-you robbin' the Safeway, or the bank?"
kansas,BANK!
safeway cashier,S-s-so y'want everyone down?  O-or just the people at the b-b-bank branch?
kansas,All of you!
hannah, Bank branch!
kansas,Bank branch!
hannah, All of you!
kansas,Bank branch only!  Everyone else - go on about your business!
fern,Shit.
diane, I'm fine here - go help!
factory worker,Not gonna let some piece-a-shit Betty Doll tell me what to do...
kansas,"Freeze or meet Jesus, Ass-hole!"
factory worker,Don't we never take the Lord's son's name in vain around this part of the U-S A!
fern," Uh, I forgot to tell you sometimes when the rebels take the gun off a corpse, some live rounds get left in the drum."
hannah," Good to know, Fern.  Good to know."
hannah, I feel like freakin' David and Goliath.
lisa," Hey, can someone dust my ass for prints over here?!"
cleo,Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
lucy,Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
kansas,Disguises incinerated!
diane,"Oh my G-d!  A real crib!  You guys - thank you!  Can you believe we did it!?  I mean, we did it.  We REALLY DID IT!"
safeway cashier,"...well, judging by the way the robbers practically flew up to spray paint security cameras, I think it was an Asian gang.  As a people, they tend to be quite tiny and very acrobatic..."
factory worker,It was a bunch of faggots!  Sure-as  queer'd shoot up a union cap!
jerry springer,"...today, we'll meet a growing number of transvestites who don't just like to dress up as women, they like to dress as pregnant women.  When we return, ""Transvestites with a Twist."""
bob goen,"...when we come back, a behind the scenes look at Fox's week long series, ""When Bettys Attack."""
dan patrick,"Tonight in St. Louis, bottom of the ninth..."
dan patrick,"Did I say that right?  A ""pack"" of Bettys?  It might be a ""gaggle"" of Bettys..."
kenny, What the hell?!
kyle,What the hell are you s'posed to be?
cartman,I'm a bank-robbin' Betty.
stan,You're not a bank-robbin' Betty - you're a fat fuck in drag...
cartman,I am not a fat fuck in drag!!!
conan,...they now believe a group of young women are responsible for the Betty Bank Robbery.  I've said for years the Betty Doll was a bad influence on young girls.
andy,You sure have...can't shut you up about your Bettys.
conan, That was kinda creepy.
andy,Do you have to notify police if you move?
kansas,It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
diane,"Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you."
kansas,She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
diane,"Yeah, hold on."
kansas,Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
diane,Don't use big bills!
kansas,For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
diane,Hello?
hannah, We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
diane,"Hannah, we've..."
hannah,"It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!"
diane,"Ooops, hold on a sec."
lucy,"Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to ""fuck me up!""  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to ""fuck me up?"""
diane,She thinks you went to the police.
lucy,WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
diane,I've got to get that.  Relax.  I'll see you tomorrow.
hannah,"...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your..."
diane,Hold on...
diane,Yeah?
diane,Hello?
diane,No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
diane,Hello?
cleo,Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
diane," Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow."
cleo,Bye.
hannah,"...and a ""bitch slap.""  I bet that really hurts!"
diane," Morning, sunshine. Remember, except for the morning sickness, blinding back pain and embarrassingly unpredictable gas - these are the best days of your life."
lisa,Hey guys.  Someone not take a shower today?
kansas,"Hey Lisa, did you run into Carmen Electra last summer?"
lisa,No.
kansas,Oh.  'Cause is looks like you got some of her tits in you...
lisa,"This just came from the National High School Cheerleading Association.  You might want to look it over before you try any more ""cradle dismounts from double base partner stunts that are over shoulder stand level without using three catchers.""  Oh, or before you think about robbing another bank."
lisa,"...and that's why I came forward.  I mean, even the kids on the short bus can see that all the evidence points to Diane and the A-squad."
fbi agent,Sure does.  Your testimony will prove invaluable.
lisa,"Unfortunately, it wasn't them."
