Speaker,Dialogue
will,I don't need to look at it.
hap,Nothing wrong with smelling the roses.
will,"Tell that to her, partner."
ellie,"Hey, Mr. Angstrom!"
ellie,Police business.
ellie,"I don't babysit any more, Mr. Angstrom. Just made detective three weeks ago."
will,"""Halibut fishing capital of the world."""
hap,This ought to be interesting.
ellie, Detective Dormer!
will,My partner...
ellie,Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to Nightmute!
ellie,"I just want to say how incredible it is to have you working with us, Detective Dormer.  I've followed all your cases. Theodore Dineli, Frank and Casey Prud'homme, the Port Angeles shootings..."
pilot,"Tell your dad the game's gonna start late this week, Ellie."
ellie,"Sure thing, Spence."
will,"You did your homework, Officer."
ellie,Actually...
ellie,I just made detective three weeks ago.
chief nyback,I'll be damned!
will," How you doing, Charlie?"
hap,"Hey, Charlie."
chief nyback,Christ.  I haven't seen you boys since...
will,Just after Leland Street.
chief nyback,"What's that, then?"
hap,Eight years.
will,Seven years.
chief nyback,"Seven years?  Where does it all go?  That was some amazing time, though, wasn't it?"
will,"You have, Chief."
chief nyback,I knew that was coming.  I deserve it.
ellie,"Yes, sir."
chief nyback,"That's all, for now."
ellie,Oh.  Right.  Okay.
will,Nice kid.
chief nyback, Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
will,"Keeping you busy up here, Charlie?"
hap,"""2nd prize Great Kodiak Salmon Catch."""
chief nyback,I told you seven years ago this was a stepping stone to retirement.
will,So far.
chief nyback,What's the D.A. got them on?
will,"Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft."
chief nyback,How about you?  How you faring?
hap,"They're all over us, Charlie."
will,They're all over everybody.
hap,"I.A.'s calling themselves the ""Corruption Task Force.""  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or ""oversights"" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night."
chief nyback,Got a bunch of messages here from some guy named Warfield.
will,That's I.A.'s pit bull.
chief nyback,Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
chief nyback,Couldn't get a thing from the body.  Not a trace.  Town's never dealt with anything like this before.
chief nyback,"This is Detective Dormer and his partner Detective Eckhart.  On loan from Buck Lundgard, Seattle Robbery and Homicide Special Branch.  They'll be helping with the Connell case."
fred,Helping?
chief nyback, This is Detective Fred Duggar.  He's been leading the investigation up to now.
will,Detective...
fred,Suppose you want to see the body.
fred,We can walk from here.
will,Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
fred,Ellie!  Go type something!
hap,Beaten to death.
coroner,Beaten to death.
will,What about these contusions?
coroner,Superficial.
will,Any signs of rape?
coroner,None.
will,Wait.
fred,No.
will,"No fibers, skin flakes, hairs..."
fred,"Like I said, no.  We know about those things up here."
will,He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
hap,Even the best make mistakes.
hap,Lower forty-eight?
rachel,You're not from here.  I can tell by your walk.
hap,Oh?  And how's that?
rachel,Unsure.
will,Detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart. There should be a reservation for us.
rachel, Your friend's all business.
will,I'm always all business.
rachel, Alaskan summers.  Hope you're an easy sleeper.  It'll be like this all night.
will,Come on in.
hap,See you have the same decor as my room.
hap,You know what about.
will,We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
hap,"When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now."
will,You know my plan of action.
hap,To do nothing.
will,That's right.
hap,"Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  Five hours.  Asking all kinds of questions..."
will,He's asking everybody questions.
hap,But he's zeroing in on me.  On us. Everyone's talking about it.
will,He's just rattling your cage.
hap,"Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard."
will,We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that.
hap, Look.  We've tampered with evidence. We've pushed witnesses.  We've planted shit.  And they're sniffing around like dogs.  Especially on the Dobbs case...
will,Weston Dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat.  You remember that?
hap,You know I remember that.
will,One word to I.A. and he walks.
hap,Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
will,No way.
hap,Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
will,"Mike Flynn's a dirty cop, Hap!  We are nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And every bastard like him.  We say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they'll all walk.  Every last one.  And I am not going to let that happen.  No deals.  No compromises.  No discussions."
hap,"Goddammit, Will.  You grab on to something and you don't let it go."
hap,"I don't know if it's because you think it's the right thing to do or because your pride won't let you do anything else.  I can't tell any more.  But I can tell you one thing.  I'm getting too old for this cowboy cop stuff.  Breaking the rules.  Cleaning up messes.  We're a dying breed, Will. You're a dying breed.  I.A., the D.A., all those reporters - they don't care what you did at Leland Street seven years ago.  They don't care that you've made this your life.  They don't care about getting the bad guy..."
will,I care.
will,You got to be kidding me.
ellie,Fred wants us to meet him at the Connell's.
ellie,Brought you a bear claw.  Just in case you were hungry.
will,Think I'll pass.
ellie,Oh.  You know.  Small-time stuff. Nothing like what you must get.  Mostly drinking-related problems.  Domestic abuse.  Barroom fights.  Stuff like that.
will,Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
ellie,But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
will,It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.
ellie,Let me just...
will,Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
ellie,Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
will,No diary.
fred,She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
will,What time was that?
fred,Around twelve-thirty.
will,Who was the last one to see her alive?
fred,"Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything."
will,These are designer.  Expensive.  Could Randy Stetz afford these?
ellie,He fixes boat engines.
will,Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
hap,What are we thinking?
will,Kay Connell had an admirer.
will,You don't seem all that sad.
randy,I haven't had a chance!  You fuckers been all over my back since Monday!
hap,You know smoking stunts your growth.
randy,"Yeah, okay, fat-ass."
hap, More Alaskan hospitality.
will,Did you love her?
randy,Huh?
will,Kay Connell.  Did you love her?
randy,Sure.  She was nice.
will,"""She was nice.""  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?"
randy,Huh?
will,You heard me that time.
randy,She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
will,But she was seeing someone else on the side.
randy,I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
will,"Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?"
randy,Stuff.
will,What kind of stuff?
randy,Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
will,The other guy?
randy,I told you I don't remember.
will,After that she left the party to go to him.
randy,How should I know?...
will,Ran like hell to go to him...
randy,"Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions..."
will,"Now you listen to me, you little shit. This fuck-the-world-Metallica-t-shirt crap may work with your mamma, but it doesn't work with me.  You got mad at your girlfriend because she was seeing someone else.  You want to be the last person who saw her alive or are you going to tell me who that is?"
randy,I don't know.
will,You don't know.
randy,She didn't tell me.
ellie,"He's a little surly, isn't he?"
will,Just a little.
will,"I want you to check this out, Ellie."
ellie,We already did.
will,Do it again.
ellie,But there wasn't any...
will,The small things - remember?  The second you're about to dismiss something - look at it again.
ellie,You want me to write that down?
will,Who's that?
ellie,The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
will,Good.  He's up next.
will, Halibut Calabrese.  Halibut Olympia. Halibut Cajun Style.  Halibut fish and chips...
hap,At least there's variety.
will,Looks like the natives are restless.
hap,Will?
hap,"I wish I could stick it out like you.  I just, with Trish and the kids..."
will,"Don't do this, Hap..."
hap,I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
will," Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing..."
hap,"You don't have to be involved, Will."
will,You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
hap,Hey - you do everything around here?
rachel,Just about.
will,I'll just have another Scotch in my room.  If you don't mind.
will,Where is it?
ellie,Over here.
will,We're sure it's hers?
fred,Has her books in it.
hap,What about prints?
will,Biology and Algebra.
farrell,I read that kind of crap.
will,Read them.  Tell me anything that strikes you.
fred,I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
will,No.
farrell,"Uh, right.  About two miles outside of town."
ellie,On the beach.
fred,Why are we taking it back?
will,"This murder was in the papers, right?"
ellie,Yeah.  All over.
will,"Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet.  We can get it in by the morning editions."
farrell,Glock 40.  All plastic save the barrel and firing pin.  Never rusts.  What do you carry down in Seattle?
farrell,Excellent!
fred,What are you doing here?
will, I told her to come.
ellie,Anything yet?
farrell,Maybe this guy doesn't read the papers.
hap,Or goes straight to the Sports Section.
fred, I see someone!
ellie,But...
fred,He's bolting!
will,Go!  Go!  Go!
will,Police!
farrell,Sorry about...
will,Where is he?
farrell,Over there.
will,Freeze!
will,Hap!
fred,Dormer...
chief nyback,And then you lost him.
will,And then I lost him.  In the fog.
chief nyback,About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
will,"Twenty, thirty seconds.  I followed the sound down to the water.  That's where..."
chief nyback,I think you need a glass of this.
will," Why didn't I know about that goddamn tunnel, Charlie?"
chief nyback,"There's a bunch of those tunnels out there, Will.  From bunkers over sixty years old.  I don't even know half of them myself, and I grew up here."
will,"I had him, Charlie.  Right in front of me.  Not two feet.  I could smell the son- of-a-bitch.  Playing with me.  And I missed the shot.  He was right there and I missed the shot!  Then my goddamned gun jammed..."
chief nyback,"Will, you can't blame yourself."
will,I had him!
chief nyback,It's only gonna make you crazy.
ellie,You wanted to see me?
chief nyback,"Right, Ellie."
ellie,But what about the Connell case?  I'm on the Connell case.
chief nyback,"We need paperwork, Ellie.  You know that. Just write up a quick report."
will,I'm going to check on the roadblocks...
chief nyback,"You're no good right now, Will.  Go back to the Lodge.  Try to get some rest."
radio,...earlier this evening after an aborted attempt to apprehend a suspect.  He was forty-five...
rachel,I'm sorry about your partner.
will,You were nice to him.  He liked you.
rachel, Hold on a second.  He's right here.
will, Dormer.
warfield's voice,"Detective Dormer.  I've been trying to reach you.  I was very sorry to hear about your partner, Detective Eckhart. It must have been a terrible shock, what happened this morning."
will, That's not exactly how I'd put it.
will," What do you mean, ""Funny?"""
warfield's voice,"Oh, nothing.  Just that I felt Detective Eckhart and I, Hap and I, were starting to make a real connection before you left.  I sensed that he was ready to get some things off his chest.  Did you sense anything like that, Detective?  I mean, as his partner?..."
will," You know why everyone hates you, Warfield?  It's not your questions, it's not your press conferences, it's not even your cheap suits; everyone hates you 'cause day after day you suck the marrow out of real cops when you never had the balls to become one yourself.  Well I got to tell you, it's a shame you're not up here with me because I'd love to show you right now just what a real cop is capable of.  You just remember that when you're sitting at your bullshit desk reading your bullshit report on my dead partner!"
will,Goddammit!
hap,"They're watching us, Will..."
will,Hap!
chief nyback,"...Nightmute hasn't lost an officer in thirty-seven years, and even though Detective Eckhart wasn't from here, he was as good as one of us on this case.  I had the honor of working with him down in Seattle for a number of years.  He was a fine detective and an even better man."
chief nyback,Okay.  Then let's get to it.
will,"It's good to be accurate, Ellie.  You're doing your job."
ellie,I'm so sorry about what happened.  I know you did everything you could...
will,I was here.
fred,Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
will,I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
fred,Partner or no partner.  That guy's a prick.
ellie,"He has to be a prick, Fred.  He's a great detective."
farrell,Detective Dormer!
will,I'm not.
farrell,"Oh, a real tear-jerker.  Brody, the good guy, just got shot."
will,Thanks.
farrell,I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
will,He would have liked that.
farrell,"We just gotta catch the bastard, right?"
will,"That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell."
farrell,What I saw?
will,Anything.  It's important.
farrell,Pretty much nothing.  That fog was so thick.  The bullet seemed to come out of nowhere.  I don't even remember seeing any shapes.  Then I saw you.  But only when you came up close.  Then you disappeared again.  I guess I heard more than I saw.
will,No.  No.  Don't be sorry.  It's not your fault.
nurse,Time for your meds.
farrell,Lonnie and I went to high school together.
lonnie,"Just take the pills, Farrell."
will,How's the leg?
farrell,"Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through."
will,Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
farrell,"We'll get the other one, though."
francis,What?
ellie,You're supposed to be Farrell.  Shot in the thigh and writhing in pain.
francis,"C'mon, Ellie.  What's it matter?"
ellie,Accuracy.  That's what.  Now get down.
francis,Ow.
ellie," ...shortly after hearing the second shot, Detective Dormer continued through the water until he spotted the body, lying approximately fifteen feet away."
francis,Ellie!  Think I found something!
will,"The woods.  One group heading south, the other heading north."
will,Alright.  Go back and set up some follow- ups for this afternoon.
fred,You don't think they should start further back?
will,"He had to have exited here.  Over those boulders.  I saw him move, he's nimble. Would have taken the hardest way out."
fred, Duggar...
rachel,Here.  It's on the house.
will,Thanks.
rachel,I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
will,Habit.
will,Fred Duggar?
rachel,No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
will,I'm not expecting anyone.
rachel,That's not what he thinks.
will,What did he look like?
rachel,Short.  Dark hair.  Not that memorable.
will,I need to borrow something.
will,I could say the same thing about you.
ellie,Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
will,Who's playing?
ellie,The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
ellie,That's my sister.
will,She your only sibling?
ellie, Twelve years younger.
will,No.  Well.  I had a brother.  He died when I was eleven.
ellie,"Oh, I shouldn't have..."
will,It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
ellie,That must have been awful for you.
will,"Not really.  Nice kid, huh?  Just kept making up more and more lies..."
ellie,You okay?
will,"I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records."
ellie, Okay.
will, Officer!...
will, Duggar - I'm at the coroner's now.  I'll be back in about twenty minutes...
coroner,Detective.  Thought you were sending one of your lackeys.
will,I thought it was better if I came.  Under the circumstances.
coroner,"It's different when you know them, isn't it?  Just sign over there and she's all yours."
will,"Thanks, Doc."
coroner,"You're looking a little green, Detective."
will,What's with all the moose antlers around here?
fred,Lots of moose.
will,When's Rich coming?
fred,I'll call him now.
will,First I need a copy of the key.
fred,"This isn't Seattle, Detective.  We don't have copies.  This is the only one."
secretary,Detective Dormer?  Telephone.
secretary,This came for you earlier.
will, Dormer.
man's voice,I bet you haven't been getting much sleep.
will, What?
man's voice,You lower-48s.  You think the white nights are kind of neat.  Then you can't sleep for days.  I've seen it happen about a million times.  But you can't sleep for a different reason.
will, Who is this?
man's voice,"I saw what really happened, Will..."
man's voice,I saw you kill your partner.  With your back-up weapon.  Out there on the beach. I saw you shoot him dead...
will, Now you listen to me...
man's voice,"Don't worry.  I won't tell anyone.  Oh, and I saw you take my gun.  My uncle's old 357.  I dropped it in the rocks. But you can go ahead and keep that."
ellie,You look like you're in a hurry.  I just wanted to ask you about these pictures.
will,Right.
ellie,"But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog."
will,Then change it.
ellie,How much closer would you say you were?
will,I don't remember.
ellie,Five feet?  Seven feet?
will,"Listen, Ellie.  I don't have time for this shit.  Five feet, seven feet, twenty feet.  Put down whatever you want in your report, alright?"
will,These should have gone out two hours ago.
young girl,...And that's how I think Kay would want us to remember her...
fred,We should go say hello to Mrs. Connell.
will,You go ahead.  I'll be there in a second.
randy,Thought I smelled something.
will,"Good to see you, too, Randy."
tanya,Who're you?
randy,Fuckin' cop.
randy,You coming or not?
tanya,I never met anyone from Seattle before.
will,You're not missing much.
tanya,What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
will,"You were good friends with Kay Connell, weren't you?"
tanya,I was her best friend.
will,Best friend?
tanya,Since grade school.
will,That's a long time.
tanya,We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
will,Must be tough for you.  What happened.
tanya,"Everybody says I'm holding up great, considering.  Don't even care if I go to school.  They're all worried I haven't cried yet."
will,What about Kay's other friends?
tanya,Do we have to talk about Kay?  I don't want to talk about her right now.  Let's just drive.  Go somewhere.
will,You want me to take you somewhere?
tanya,Long as it's fun.
will,How about this.  You like this?
tanya,Hey...
will,Thought you wanted something fun...
tanya,Move over!
tanya,You crazy son-of-a-bitch!  You could have killed us!
will,You and Kay were like sisters?
tanya,That's what I said.
will,Told each other everything.  That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?
tanya,No...
will,Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
tanya,I don't know.
will,You don't know.
tanya,She wouldn't tell me!
will,But you were such good friends...
tanya,It was like some big fucking secret!
will,What was?
tanya,She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That he was going to take her!
will,Who?
tanya,My arm!
will,Who?
tanya,She used some stupid code name.
will,What was it?
tanya,Brody...I don't know...  ...Something Brody!
will,Lucy.  Desi.
bedroom," Single bed.  Books and magazines.  A half-eaten tuna sandwich on the bedside table.  ""NYPD BLUE"" calendar on the wall.  It's quiet.  He walks over to a large DESK by the window. Scattered papers.  Computer.  Mini cassette recorder."
walter's voice,Now you're mad at me.
will,Goddammit!
fred,Forget your pager?
will,What?
fred,I beeped you over two hours ago.
will,Good.
fred,And something else that might interest you.
will,No.
fred,One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
will,That's right.
fred,Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
will,So?
fred,This is a local writer.  Kay had all his books.  I think we should check it out.
will,I don't think it'll lead anywhere.
old lady,I don't think you should move.
old lady,You sure you're okay?
will,I'm fine.
old lady,Careful not to bleed on my interior.
will,Walter Byrd.
walter,When I was seven my mother and grandmother took me to Vancouver.  We were walking along the street one day when these two men ran past and snatched my grandmother's purse right from under her arm.  Right from under her arm.  That night a police officer came to our hotel room to ask us questions.  Stood the whole time.
walter,You know this glacier moves a quarter of an inch every day?
will,You think this is a nice meeting we're having here?  Friendly?  Two people getting acquainted?  Huh?
will,That was an accident!  You hear me?  I didn't know it was him!  I didn't know it was him!
walter,Then why lie about it?
will,"What's your game, Byrd?"
walter,No game.
will,The phone call.  The knapsack.
walter,"I figured we're partners on this one.  I mean, after what I saw..."
will,"Let's get one thing straight, Byrd.  We are partners on nothing."
walter,"I research my novels.  I know the procedures.  You'd have cuffed me back at the ferry.  You'd have called for back- up, read me my rights, and gotten a search warrant for my apartment.  You're a well-respected detective.  There's no reason for you to be talking to me right now..."
will, You're going to get a phone call.
walter,I'm sorry?
will,I said you're going to get a phone call.
will,Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
walter,Thought you might find that.
will,You're going to be brought in for questioning.
walter,Down at the station?
will, Yes down at the station.
walter,Okay.  Okay.  Brought in for questioning. Good.  I can write this.
will,"What do you mean, ""wild card?"""
walter,Next ferry's in forty-five minutes.
will,"What do you mean ""wild card?"""
walter,You'll know.  At the questioning.
ticket taker, Full up.
will,I have a cold.
ellie,Which way are you walking?
will,Back to the Lodge.
ellie,I needed to get your signature on something.
will,I trust you.
will,Duggar called him?
ellie,About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
will,Not really.
ellie,"Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?"
will,No.  But it sounds like something I would've said.
ellie,Oh!  I forgot to tell you.  The Puffins won.
will," Listen to me, you son-of-a-bitch..."
recorded voice,...I saw you look right into his eyes and shoot him...
will,"Goddammit, Byrd!"
walter,"You'd have done the same thing, Will.  I know you would..."
will,I didn't know!
hap,"You sure about that, buddy?"
will,Fuck!
rachel, Will...I...
will,What is it?
rachel,There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep.
rachel,Are you alright?
will,I'm fine.
rachel,Did something happen?
will,No.
rachel,Will...
will,The light.  It keeps coming in...
rachel,Will.
will,There was this guy named Weston Dobbs. Twenty-four.  Worked as a part-time stock boy in a copy store.  Every morning he'd sit at the only window in his apartment and watch an eight year-old boy get picked up by his carpool across the street.  And every afternoon he'd watch the boy get dropped off again.  He did this for about six months.  Until one day he got up the nerve to cross the street and grab the boy before his carpool came. Kept him in his apartment for three days. Tortured him.  Raped him.  Made him do things...
rachel,One of your cases?
will,"Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment."
rachel,What happened?
will,We took some blood samples from the boy's body and planted them in his apartment.  Arrested him the next day.
rachel,Will.
will,There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
rachel,What if someone finds out?
will,We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
rachel,"Well, that's not going to happen now."
will,Do you think it was wrong?  What we did?
rachel,"There are two kinds of people in Alaska. Those who were born here and those who've come here to escape something in their lives.  I wasn't born here, Will.  I'm in no position to judge anyone.  I'm not about that any more."
fred,In what manner?
walter,"She was, not quite a ""fan.""  More an avid reader of my detective novels."
ellie,When did you first meet her?
walter,A year ago.  At one of my signings.
fred,Where you signed this?
walter,That's right.
fred,What happened at that signing?
walter,She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
fred,Did she?
walter,Yes.  Not that much at first.  But then she became more comfortable.  Started visiting me every week...
will,What was the nature of your relationship?
walter,"What do you mean, Detective Dormer?"
will,She was an attractive girl.  Did you have sex with her?
walter,She was only seventeen.
will,But she was an attractive girl.
walter,I suppose.
will,Did you have sex with her?
walter,No.
will,But you wanted to.
walter,I was a mentor to her.
will,You gave her gifts.
walter,Yes.
will,Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
walter,Yes.
will,Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
walter,I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
fred,"We understand, Mr. Byrd.  You want to sit down, Detective?"
walter,She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
fred,How do you mean?
walter,That boyfriend.  Randy.
fred,Randy Stetz?
walter,That's right.
will,What about him?
walter,"He.  Well, he..."
fred,Mr. Byrd.  Anything you can tell us could help out with this case.
walter,Well.  He hit her.
fred,Are you sure about that?
walter,"She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret."
ellie,Randy Stetz beat Kay Connell?
fred, Ellie.
walter,He has a terrible rage.  Kay even said he carried a handgun around with him.
fred,Margaret!  Get Judge Biggs on the phone!  I'll get another warrant for Stetz's place.
walter,"Could I have some more coffee, Detective Burr?"
fred,"C'mon, Randy."
randy,I swear to God.  I didn't kill her.  I swear to God...
fred,"You look like shit, cowboy."
will,That's an understatement.
fred,Looks like we can wrap this one up.
rich,"What do you mean, you can't believe it?"
francis,He was an asshole.
farrell,That doesn't mean anything.
fred,Didn't you grow up with him?
farrell,Our dads were on the same boat.  We used to wait for them together.
francis,He used to pick fights at the gas station.
rich,And remember when he did all those donut holes that one summer?
fred,Just a bad seed.
farrell,How do you like our beer?
will,I like it fine.
fred,What Detective Dormer needs is a little shut-eye.
rich,The white nights been hard on you?
will,They haven't been easy.
francis,They don't have titanium shades over at the Pioneer.
rich,Well no wonder.
francis,You lose all sense of time.
farrell,Better than Fred's home town.
fred,My people are from Barrow.  Way up north.
rich,In the winter there's no sunlight for five straight months.
fred,Like being swallowed up in a black hole.
fred,Nancy Drew!  Pull up a seat!
francis,"You hear what happened, Ellie?"
ellie,Yeah.
rich,Pretty cool.
farrell,Rich found the gun.
ellie,I know.  I heard.
fred,Something's on Nancy's mind.
ellie,I found this out on the beach.
farrell,What is it?
ellie,Shell casing.  9mm.
francis,"Let it go, Ell.  We got the bad guy."
ellie,None of us carries a 9mm duty weapon.
rich,"Get a hobby, will ya?"
ellie,"It's a legitimate point, isn't it, Detective Dormer?"
will,It's legitimate.
ellie,Worth pursuing?
will,"The case is closed, Ellie.  I got the next round."
ellie,"Me, Pop!"
ellie's dad,Ellie?  You okay?
ellie,Where's all my academy stuff?
walter," Hi, Will..."
will,What the hell are you doing calling me at the station?
walter,I figured we should touch base.  Compare notes.  I think it went well.  What did you think?
will,Randy Stetz is in jail.
walter,Told you I could write an ending.
will,Congratulations.
walter,I thought maybe we could talk some more.
will,There's nothing more to talk about.
walter,But we work so well together...
will,We do nothing well together.  Nothing!  You understand me?
walter,"You run on two settings, Will.  I've noticed that..."
will,What the hell do you know?
walter,"Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me."
walter,Then so was mine...
will,Don't you pull that shit with me.
walter,"I didn't want to kill her, Will."
will,"Couldn't get it up, Walter?"
walter,It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
will,Like this?
walter,Yes.  Like that.
will,"This an accident, Walter?"
walter,If you want it to be...
will,It took ten minutes to beat Kay Connell to death.  Ten minutes.
walter,I have a summer house up by Kgun Lake. I'm going to write my next novel there. It's about a famous detective who goes bad.
will,Six-thirty.
fred,If Spencer's not too drunk to fly.
chief nyback,Can't talk you into staying for a couple of days?  Do some fishing?  Show you what normally goes on around here.
will,I have to get back.
chief nyback,Too bad...
will,Had a lot of help from Nightmute's finest.
ellie,Didn't want to miss anything.
chief nyback,Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
ellie,Good.
chief nyback,Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
ellie,Sure.
rachel,I found a new friend.
ellie,"Very funny, Farrell..."
ellie,"Hi, Rachel."
rachel,I would have seen if he came back.
ellie,Detective Dormer?
rachel,What is all this?
will,No.
walter,Where's your back-up?
will,No back-up.
walter,You're not following procedure.
will,Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
walter,"We're on the same side, Will.  You know that.  After what we've been through together.  We're partners.  Bound by a secret."
will,"That's where you're wrong, Walter."
walter,"You give the police a bad name, Will."
ellie,Shit!
will, Walter?
walter,Wild card.
will,"Drop the gun, Walter."
walter,"That jammed the last time, remember?"
will,Another J. Brody mystery.
will,"God, you're a pain in the ass."
ellie,You're shot.
will,"You, too."
ellie,I'm going to make a tourniquet.
will,Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house.
ellie,I know.
will,Byrd's dead.
ellie,"You shot Detective Eckhart, didn't you?"
will,Yes.
ellie,Did you mean to?
will,No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
ellie,Why?
will,"Because I just couldn't be wrong.  Don't ever get that way, Ellie.  Don't ever lose your way.  It blurs the line."
ellie,This one looks worse.
will," Just let me sleep, Ellie..."
ellie,No!
will,What about your shoulder?
ellie,Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
