man 1,(loudly through the
man 2,"What the hell is it? With his hand, one of the scientists removes the dust around some SKELETAL REMAINS."
man 3,They look human... The strange shape of the bones and skull makes it impossible to tell whether they are human or animal.
man 2, Look what we found. Have you...
big bob,"where the hell is everybody? I'm gonna... Before he can finish his sentence, the old gas station man appears."
ethel,My crazy husband absolutely had to see the desert.
big bob,"You know, it's illegal to smoke around a gas station. The old man bursts out in laughter revealing rotten teeth."
doug,Piece of shit! Why couldn't we fly like normal people?
lynn,"Relax Doug, please. It's their silver anniversary and they're so happy you're here."
doug,"Please, your parents can't stand me."
lynn,You're wrong. They love you.
doug,We could have taken them on a cruise.
lynn,"Yeah, that's a great idea. Why didn't you plan it?"
doug,What's that supposed to mean?
lynn,Never mind. Lynn grabs the milk bottle from its heater.
doug,Maybe I shouldn't have even come.
lynn,"Doug, please stop. I never ask you for anything, OK?  Well see how happy you are when Catherine comes along on our 25th anniversary. She walks out."
lynn,"If you want to use the restroom, it's now or never. Bobby removes his headphones and pushes Brenda."
bobby,"Wake up, lard ass."
brenda,"Bobby, come look at this. Bobby joins her."
bobby,You two make a perfect pair. Bobby turns to a rusty car and unzips to urinate.
brenda,Don't pee there...
bobby,Why not?
brenda,(pointing to a small
bobby,"God, what do you care? Bobby re-zips and heads towards the small wooden outhouse while Brenda plays with the baby pig."
brenda,"Piggy, piggy, piggy..."
doug," Excuse me sir, do you have a phone I can use? I can't get a signal around here and... Big Bob interrupts."
big bob,"Give. the phone a rest, Bukowski!"
doug,"Sorry Bob, ""duty calls""..."
lynn,"Honey, you haven't put that phone down since we left."
doug,This is why I don't go on vacation. They're lost without me.
big bob,"Stop being at everyone's beck and call, Bukowski. You're the boss, remember?"
ethel,.I'm sure all that important business can wait till next week. Doug gives up. He kisses Lynn and takes the baby from her.
bobby,"What the hell Brenda! The eye goes away... He re-zips looking outside. Nobody. When he exits, Brenda appears on the other side."
brenda,What?
ethel,How far are we from 1-88?
ethel,I told you we should have gone through Santa Fe. You never listen to me.
big bob,Doesn't bother me. I had night patrol for almost fifteen years...
big bob,Detective...
ethel, Not anymore. Thank God!
big bob,I'm starting a private security firm... The old man turns to Doug-
doug,Who me? No way. I'm in telecommunications. A beat.
doug,Everybody's gotta have a cell phone...
doug,"No kidding... As the old man closes the hood, a familiar sound returns-"
big bob,What do -I owe you? The old man looks at the gas pump.
doug,"Let me pay, Bob."
doug,That's not what I meant...
lynn,"Sorry, our dog got out...She won't stay put... A car horn breaks the silence."
big bob,Let's go! KNOCK KNOCK The old man knocks on the window. Big Bob opens-
ethel,"He's right, Bob."
big bob,I'm fully aware of the driving laws.
big bob,Everyone ready?
big bob,Thanks for the tip.
doug, I tried for an hour but I couldn't get it cold in here. CLICK- the light turns on and the A/C starts.
doug,How do you know all this stuff?
bobby,I don't know.
doug,"Well, at least we can breathe now."
bobby,I thought you stopped smoking?
doug,(lighting it with a
bobby, It's cool that you came with us. It's a drag when it's just us and our parents...
doug,"Hey, I like seeing your parents... Bobby is surprised."
brenda,"Neither do we, Dad. On the road, the Lizard continues carving a dusty path."
ethel,"Don't drive so fast Bob, you might lose the camper..."
ethel,"Hey... Watch your mouth, young lady.  Will you please back me up here?"
lynn," Relax, Mom. We're all just tired."
brenda,"You grew up in the 60's. How can you be so uptight?! Still driving, Big Bob turns to his daughters-"
big bob,She remembers...
lynn,Doug? Bobby? Are you alright? Bobby opens the door releasing the barking dogs.
bobby,"Don't worry, we're fine."
lynn,She's fine. Mom has her.
doug,I knew this wasn't gonna be safe for the baby.
lynn,The heat must have caused a blow out.
doug,Are you all right?
lynn,I think so... Just a little shaken up. Bobby walks around the car evaluating the damage- The SUV tires are shredded - the rims buried into the ground.
bobby,Holy shit!
doug,"97% nationwide coverage, and we have to find ourselves in that"
lynn,Doug...
doug,"I hope he's enjoying himself. On his knees, by the SUV tires, Big Bob inspects under the vehicle... Not only are the tires flattened, but the front axel has buckled from hitting the rocks."
ethel,"Oh, so now it's my fault? Doug joins them."
doug,"So what's the damage, General?"
big bob,The damn axel is broken...
doug,Can we fix it?
big bob,"With what? The frame is completely twisted... Give me your phone, I'm gonna call a tow truck..."
doug,I already tried. I'm not getting a signal.
ethel,Can we use the C/B?
big bob,"That old thing? Give it a try, but this is mining country. Whatever metal is left in those hills will probably scramble the signal..."
doug,"What are we going to do? Without answering, Big Bob gets back on his feet, wipes his hands and grabs a bottle of water from the car. After a long"
big bob,"We're going to walk, that's what..."
doug,Walk?! But we're miles from
big bob, So we wait here for someone to drive by? Have you seen a car in the last three hours?!
ethel,I bet this desert is full of rattlesnakes...
bobby,"I saw a documentary on The Discovery channel about desert snakes. If you get bit, you'll die in twenty minutes. Big Bob reaches into the glove compartment pulling out a 9mm and an extra clip. He hands it to his son."
big bob, I'd like to see how they stack up against this... Ethel brings her husband's jacket and helps him put it on.
ethel,Some things never change...
big bob, I'll take my bullets over your prayers any day.
bobby,"You think we'll see scorpions and coyotes? Big.Bob grabs his son by the shoulders, proud. They look like two kids getting ready to play Cowboys and Indians. Bobby calls out to Doug, offering the gun-"
bobby,"Come on, just one shot, it makes you feel kinda powerful. Big Bob answers for Doug-"
big bob,"Leave him alone son. Doug is a liberal, he wouldn't touch a gun... Obviously, the two men disagree. Behind the trailer, Brenda sits on a lounge chair in her bra revealing a sexy body. She applies suntan lotion ready to kill some time. Behind her sunglasses, she observes the silent desert looking like Paris Hilton. Lynn exits the trailer and joins her."
lynn,Catherine just fell asleep. How are you holding up?
lynn,"Yeah, this is a total drag, especially with a baby."
brenda,"I don't care what they say, next year, I'm going to Cancun with my friends. No more ""family trips"" for me..."
lynn,"We're not going to have many more trips like this together... As for Cancun, you're gonna have to find a job."
brenda,"C'mon, with all the money your husband makes, you could at least buy me a plane ticket."
brenda," ""Right away, honey..."" Without turning around, Lynn gives her sister the finger. Brenda smiles with satisfaction."
doug,I'll keep walking north. This road's gotta lead somewhere. Lynn comes around with the jacket and sees Big Bob and Bobby both holding guns.
lynn,What are you going to do with those?
big bob,It's always good to be prepared. Right?
big bob,We've only got two and it's better if you guys have one here. You never know.
lynn,Are you sure you're going to be alright? Lynn puts a fisherman's hat on Doug to protect him from the sun and kisses him tenderly.
big bob,If you don't find any help in six or seven miles come back. I'll go to the gas station...
ethel,"It's almost 3, you'll never be back before sunset."
big bob,It's only about ten miles from here. I'll borrow that crazy old man's truck and use his phone if he has one... Don't worry... I'll be back with a tow truck before nightfall.
bobby,Can I go with Doug?
big bob,No. Stay here with your mother and sisters.
brenda,"Yeah, right. Ethel remains silent and worried."
ethel,We should pray before you go-
brenda,Oh please!
ethel,"Is it really too much to ask?  Bob? Bob finally agrees, and like a good family man, he gathers them around. Brenda slips on her shirt and joins them."
lynn,"Hey, little princess. Who doesn't want to sleep anymore? The baby looks at her mother, appeased."
ethel,You shouldn't go from the bottle to the breast. At her age she should get used to one or the other.
lynn,"Mom, thanks for the advice, but she's my baby. Vexed, Ethel remains quiet."
brenda,"I can already see the headlines: ""Family found dead in New Mexico desert."""
ethel,This place isn't so bad. At least the air is fresh.
brenda,I think it stinks.
lynn,Better than Cleveland...
brenda,Anything's better than Cleveland!
ethel, Maybe it was my fault we had this accident...
lynn,"Please, Mom. Nothing can stop Dad when he thinks he's found a shortcut. Remember when we ran out of gas on the ""shortcut"" to the Great Lakes? How old was I? 12, 13?"
ethel,This family has certainly seen its share of adventures.
brenda,If we had just stayed on the main road we'd already be in California...
lynn,Yeah-what I'd do for a shower and a margarita...
brenda,The beach...
lynn,A real bed... Bobby sits down at the table.
bobby,Has anybody seen my grey sweatshirt? It was in the car. I've looked everywhere.
brenda,"I didn't touch your smelly sweatshirt. Beast has been pulling on his chain nonstop, while Beauty cries softly from inside the trailer."
lynn,Why are the dogs so excited?
ethel,Probably some rattlesnakes not far away.
ethel,"Brenda's going off to college. And then, next year, it's Bobby's turn... The house is going to feel so empty... Lynn grabs her mother's hand-"
brenda,That makes one of us. They glare at her as she opens the door.
bobby,"Brenda, the dogs! Too late. Beauty runs out in the direction of the hills Bobby drops his plate and gives chase."
lynn,"I don't know, Mom."
ethel,She couldn't have gone that far. Brenda notices the revolver on the table. Bobby is unarmed.
bobby,"Beauty? Beauty? Bobby moves cautiously. He picks up a big stone for protection- A dangerous animal could be hiding behind any corner. A SHADOW PASSES BEHIND HIM.. Bobby doesn't notice. Anaaaaaau - A swift sound of breathing breaks the silence. Bobby spins around, ready to strike."
young girl,Ru... Ruby... Ruby...
bobby,What are you doing here Ruby? Where are your parents? My family needs help. We had an accident. Ruby repeats her name mechanically as if she doesn't understand the questions.
ruby, Ru... Ruby... Ruby... Bobby gets closer.
bobby,"I heard you, Ruby... Are you here alone? Ruby won't answer."
ruby,Beauty...
bobby,"That's right, have you seen her?"
ruby,Ruby.. _Ruby is Beauty... The last sentence makes her laugh. A STRANGE AGONIZING
bobby,Have you seen her? Ruby looks down. She knows something.
bobby,"Ruby, come back! Once more, Bobby is alone in the labyrinth. On the other side, he finds a trail of blood as if a body had been dragged on the rocks. The bloody trail is still fresh and disappears behind another set of rocks a few feet away. Bobby hesitates, unsure of what he might find... As soon as he's around the outcropping to the other side Bobby sees something that stops him dead in his tracks. Before him, on the ground, is Beauty. Dead. Disemboweled. Bobby drops to his knees, disbelieving, his face turning white. He touches the animal's head as if to convince himself that this nightmare can't be possible at all. Beauty's face is locked in a grimace of horrible pain and shock. And... the animal is missing its front right leg. DRIP... DRIP... DRIP... DROPS OF BLOOD fall on Bobby's hand - ABOVE HIM, PERCHED ON A ROCK, A FIGURE OBSERVES HIM. A man with an impressive build crouches like a monkey. He wears old clothes covered with dust, and a DERBY HAT on his head. Binoculars hang around his neck."
doug,"""...All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray. I've been for a walk on a winter's day. I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A... California dreamin..."" After hours of walking down this road, his face shows signs of fatigue."
lynn,"Keep it together Brenda, Mom is already worried enough... The fire will help Bobby find his way back."
brenda,What if he doesn't come back? Maybe he's hurt. Maybe there was an accident...
lynn,He and Beauty will find their way back together. Lynn hugs her sister.
brenda,Bobby was only wearing a t-shirt when he left.
lynn,I know...
big bob,Somebody home? Hello? Big Bob pushes the last door leading to the back room. His hand feels for the light switch. CLICK - an old lamp comes on in the corner. He finds a wall mounted phone and picks up the receiver. No tone.
voices,Daddy... Daddy...Daaaddyyy...Daddy.. THE VOICES ARE HORRIFIC AND TERRIFYING. Big Bob backs up pointing his gun in their direction.
big bob,Who's there?
voices,Dad-dy...Dad-dy...Daddy...Dad-dy... Big Bob can't contain his fear and shoots blindly into the darkness.
big bob,"Who's there? Show yourself! The voices become louder and louder, omnipresent."
voices,"Dad-dy...Dad-dy...Daaaddyyy... Daddy.. Daddy... Big Bob walks backwards to the truck, and trips on the ground. Wide eyed, he stands and throws himself on the car door."
ethel," Hello...Hello... Can somebody hear me? Please answer if you hear me. Hello? No answer. The radio goes silent. Lynn joins her, holding the baby."
lynn,How's it going?
ethel,I heard something. She fiddles with the radio.
lynn, Mayday ...mayday... This is a distress call... Do you copy? Still nothing.
lynn,"Mayday. . .We're stranded in the desert, we need help...mayday... Suddenly, the light on the C/B turns green and static can be heard. Ethel grabs her daughter's hand, hopeful that someone may have heard them. A second later, HEAVY BREATHING is heard over the radio. The light turns off. The two women look at each other in confusion."
ethel,It sounded like an animal... Lynn stands up worried.
lynn,"If animals start answering our radio calls, we're really fucked!"
ethel,Watch your language!
lynn,"Give it a rest, Mom. We have more important things to worry about. She walks out."
ethel,"Lynn, wait. Ethel stays alone with the baby."
lynn,Brenda? No answer.
brenda,I'm here! I'll be back in a minute. The flashlight partially lights the desert as she disappears into the night.
ethel,You're lucky Brenda found you. Imagine if you had to spend the whole night out there in the cold. Bobby winces from the pain.
brenda,"Don't worry, Beauty will come back when she's hungry... Bobby doesn't answer. He keeps the truth to himself, not wanting to worry his family."
bobby,Have you tried the radio?
ethel,It doesn't work...
lynn,We heard something. Some sort of breathing... Bobby lifts his head.
bobby,What do you mean?
lynn,"It was really weird, right mom?"
ethel, I'm sure it was just static.
lynn,"Mom, it sounded like a perverted crank call."
bobby, Ssshhhh... His mother and two sisters are surprised by his agitated behavior.
brenda,What's wrong with you? Footsteps. Someone approaches.
bobby," I want you guys to stay in here. Brenda?! You hear me? Gun in hand, he opens the door- Bobby is about to shoot when a figure emerges from the dark. IT'S DOUG, holding as much as he could carry from the car graveyard."
doug,What the fuck are you doing? Don't point that thing at me. Bobby lowers the weapon.
bobby,I didn't know it was you.
doug,Who else would it be?! Bobby is interrupted by Brenda who sees Doug from the window.
brenda,Doug's back!
doug,"Hey girls! Quickly, Lynn exits the trailer and jumps into her husband's arms. They kiss. Doug sets down all of his findings."
lynn,What are you going to do with a fishing pole in the desert? You didn't you find anybody?
doug,No. The road just stops there. I hope your dad has better luck. Is there anything to eat? I'm starving.
lynn,"Let's go, it's freezing out here. Doug follows Lynn inside the trailer."
ethel,Looks like we're camping out tonight. How's your head? Bobby doesn't answer.
bobby,"Nothing, Mom."
ethel,Are you sure?
bobby,I'll feel a lot better when dad gets back.
ethel,"Me too, honey. Come inside. You've already spent enough time in the cold for one day, don't you think?"
lynn,"Don't close the door, we're leaving in a second!"
doug,"I'm tired, I really need to rest for an hour or so..."
bobby,We can squeeze in here. You'll be more comfortable.
doug,You want us to sleep on the floor?! Doug kisses Catherine and hands her to Brenda so she can put her to bed. Bobby takes him aside.
doug,What? Bobby hesitates to talk.
lynn,I'm almost ready...
doug,"Listen... I'm sure your dad will be back soon. He's ""Big Bob"". It's gonna take more than a few snakes in the dark to stop him, right?"
brenda,Can I listen to your iPod? Bobby is still focused on the door.
bobby,What?
brenda,Can I borrow your iPod?
doug,"Ow, Ow... Yeah right there. Perfect. God, I feel like I crossed New Mexico on foot. Amused, Lynn squeezes his legs a bit harder. She moves up to his love handles."
lynn,"A little work out can't be all that bad for these guys, right? Doug laughs and giggles."
doug,"Stop! Stop, you're tickling me! Lynn continues with more fervor."
lynn,I love you...
doug,I love you too... They start making out.
bobby,"Beast?! He grabs the gun and exits the trailer, leaving the door open."
bobby,"Beast? Come on, boy. You hear me! Come on now. Bobby moves further from the trailer towards the barking."
bobby,"Doug! Doug! Caught red-handed, Lynn dresses and Doug pulls up his pants."
doug,Damanit! What is it now?
lynn," What do you want, Bobby?"
bobby,"Come on, open up! Lynn opens the back window giving him a dirty look."
lynn,This had better be important. Bobby is too scared to keep the truth hidden. He regains his calm before talking.
bobby,"Something's going on around here. We're not alone. Exasperated, Lynn takes a deep breath, not taking him seriously."
lynn,"Bobby... We're in the middle of nowhere. Believe me, no one could survive out here!"
bobby,I saw them. And Beauty...
doug,Beauty what?
bobby,They cut out her insides.
lynn,What are you talking about?
bobby,Her guts were all over the place... He struggles to talk.
doug,"Calm down Bobby, OK? Let's go check it out together. Lynn, stay right here."
pluto,Noaowww!
lizard,"Move!  You gotta be a man to do that... Pluto is outraged and tries to stand up. He wants to talk but no words come out. JUST GRUNTS AND GROWLS. Lizard savagely hits him several times. Behind them, terrified, Brenda watches helplessly as they fight. Lizard puts his foot on Pluto's face, pinning him to the ground, and then points the gun to his head."
ethel,No..No.. It's not possible. That's not Bob. That's not my Bob. She grabs Doug by his shirt trying to convince him.
doug,"Take your mother away from here! With her eyes fixed on her father, Lynn walks her mother away. In Bobby's eyes, sadness has been replaced by hatred. Full of rage, the youngster grabs the gun and walks away."
bobby,I'm gonna take care of the motherfuckers!
doug,"Come back here, Bobby! Bobby disappears into the night. Doug covers Big Bob's face with a blanket."
lynn,Oh my god! Lynn runs inside leaving her mother alone.
bobby,Come on Doug! They're in the trailer-! They both take off running.
lizard,Take it. Pluto obeys. Lizard grabs Brenda by the hair and pulls her out of the trailer.
lizard,"I'll come back for ya... Lizard disappears into the night. Brenda lays on the ground trembling and crying. Doug arrives at the trailer, while Bobby aims the 9mm at the assassins."
ethel,"This camper's so small. No matter how much you clean, it's always a mess."
doug,Not yet.
ethel,Did everyone go to bed?
doug,"Yes, Brenda is here and Bobby is in the kitchen. At the other end, Bobby turns away, crying. Brenda looks away as well."
ethel, Is Lynn sleeping? Doug holds back the tears.
doug,Yes..  Do you need anything? Ethel finds it more and more difficult to talk.
ethel,"Look in the closet Doug, I'm sure I have another blanket. I'm so cold. Doug tucks one of the blankets around her."
ethel,"You've always been so sweet. I understand why Lynn loves you so much. She raises her arm to caress his face. Her hand falls on the bed. Lifeless. Brenda screams, bursting into tears."
bobby,"Fine. You stay here. I'm going after them. Doug gets between Bobby and the door, preventing the kid from leaving."
doug,"You want to die, too?"
bobby,I don't care. Doug drags him in front of his mother's body.
doug,Look! Look at what they did to your mother. Look at what they did to your sister. He slams Bobby against the door.
bobby,"Think about what? They have Catherine, Doug... Doug remains silent..."
brenda,No.. No... don't turn it off!
doug,"Get ready Bobby.. Doug opens the door and jumps out ready to fight. From beneath the trailer, someone observes him... Doug bends down and discovers- GOGGLE'S SEVERED ARM. In its hand, the walkie-talkie still works."
doug,"Beast! The dog jumps into Doug's arms and begins licking his face. Bobby can't believe it, his dog has returned. Radio static comes back on the walkie. Bobby picks it up-"
bobby,Good boy.. That's a good dog.
bobby,"I don't know, half a clip?"
brenda,"Mayday... Mayday... We need help ..Mayday... Mayday... can anybody hear me? Something has gone off in her eyes. She is absent, no longer living, just surviving. Doug is about to leave, taking with him anything from the trailer which might be useful."
bobby,Let me go with you.
doug,"No, you stay here with your sister and stay by the radio. Somebody's bound to hear us. Brenda continues her distress call."
brenda,Mayday...mayday... Can anybody hear me?
bobby,What about you?
doug,"Don't worry about me, I'll take Beast. Beast sits at his feet ready to go. Doug straps the walkie- talkie over his shoulder."
bobby,Doug?
doug,Yes?
bobby,"I... I didn't mean what I said... Doug hugs him like a brother. Before walking out, he bends down to Lynn's body and kisses her one last time on the mouth."
doug,I'm going to find.our baby my love...I promise.
doug, I told you to stop smoking. Doug sets a different frequency on his radio-
doug,"I followed the blood, I'm in front of a mine!"
bobby,"Yeah... Good luck, Doug. He puts the walkie away and takes out the flashlight."
doug,"Come on. You can't be serious. Then light goes. completely off, leaving Doug in darkness. Scratch! - He lights a match. Holding the tiny flame, Doug continues down the tunnel until he arrives at another fork. He can no longer see the blood trail."
brenda,Maybe somebody heard our calls..
bobby,"Nobody's going to find us Brenda, even with that smoke...Nobody's coming._.. You heard what Doug said-We're alone now, just you and me. Let them come, I'm waiting for them. Now, Bobby stretches the nylon wire from the fishing pole around each stake. He sets the fishing pole next to the trailer, rigging to it one of Catherine's TOY SHAKERS- An improvised alarm system."
doug,"Find her, Beast, find Catherine... With his nose to the ground, the dog pulls Doug straight ahead. Doug walks away through the streets, pulled by the dog. On the outskirts of town, we discover a fence buried in the sand. On it, an old metallic sign reads-"
doug,Where's my baby! Where's Catherine?! Big Brain does not answer.
doug,Where is she then? ANSWER ME! He raises the bat.
big brain," .I don't know where she is. I never leave this place... Big Brain moves away from the window wheeling himself to the couch. His hands are thin and pale, like a child's."
doug,What signs?!
doug,What the hell are you saying?!
big brain," You people settled on our lands, you destroyed our homes, destroyed our silver mines. . .You 'ye made us what we've become! One day my father went into town begging for your help, and you know what the doctors did? They sterilized him like a dog! You thought that in the desert no one would see anything, or say anything, but the hills... The hills never forget..."
doug,I don't know what you're talking about. All I want is my daughter. Please... Big Brain remains silent.
big brain,"Maybe a trailer? Yeah, a pretty trailer, just like yours."
doug,Where are the others? Where is my baby? Big brain starts laughing a high pitched sound.
doug,"Please, I'm begging you... Don't kill me..."
pluto, Loook at-t hiiis fa-ace... Loook at- at hiiis fa-ace... Even the frozen faces of the test dummies seem to mock him.
big brain,The baby... the baby is in the last house on the left...
big brain,Lizard... Kill the baby...
lizard,Get out of the way Ruby...
doug,Catherine?! He goes to the crib and discovers a plastic doll...
doug,Catherine!
brenda,"I don't.see anybody... What's happening? Bobby and Brenda leave their hiding place. They move, back to back, cautious..."
brenda,"Look! Further ahead, on the ground, a tumbleweed is stuck on the fishing wire, moving it in the wind."
lizard,"Ruby...Ruby! You come back here right now. You hear me, you little bitch? The road on the edge comes to a dead end. Ruby is stuck, the only way out is to climb. Without using her hands, she attempts to ascend. It's close to impossible."
doug,"My baby ...My little princess... It's me, it's daddy... He kisses the baby and hugs her tightly, elated. Ruby is moved. She smiles when suddenly her face freezes-"
brenda,"Come on, Bobby. Let's get out of here... Bobby's face has changed. He is no longer the innocent kid of just a few hours ago. His eyes are now filled with rage and a determination to survive and succeed no matter what. Brenda and Bobby walk away from the burning trailer. On the other side of the smoke, they see-"
