Speaker,Dialogue
anchorwoman,"--addressing the United Nations today, the President expressed his concern over the increasingly intense territorial disputes in both Asia and the Middle East. CUT TO: The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES--"
president,The sound of a bullet at one end of the world echoes across the ocean to the other end. Armed conflict is not self contained in its respective region--the consequences reverberate through every nation across the world and therefore must be avoided at all costs. CUT BACK TO: The Anchorwoman--
anchorwoman,"While the President's position was clear, he did not comment on whether or not he would order Dr. Manhattan into action should the situation continue to escalate. CUT TO: Stock footage of DR. MANHATTAN--a man, at least he appears to be, who has glowing blue skin. The stock footage shows Dr. Manhattan flying through the air as a MISSILE heads straight for him."
blake,"Just a matter of time, I suppose. With sudden, blinding speed, Blake WHIPS the SAUCER from under his cup, sending it FLYING like a saw-blade. The Intruder BATS IT out of the air with even quicker reflexes, but the act buys Blake time to pull a PISTOL with a SILENCER from a hollowed out STEREO SPEAKER. He's a pro . but so is our Intruder. Before Blake can get a shot off, the Intruder is already upon him, SNATCHING the gun out of Blake's hand-- --Blake PUNCHES the Intruder in the chest plate--the Intruder drops the gun. Blake fights. Not like an old man, but like the trained killer he is. But the Intruder is much, much faster. Younger. Deadlier. He SMASHES Blake with an elbow to the head. Blake falls. BLOOD blurs his vision. The Intruder picks Blake up off the ground. Brings him to the window with the great New York view. Thirty stories up. Blake looks the Intruder in the eye . and starts laughing. Hysterical."
cop 1,Hey! This is still a goddamn crime scene!
shopkeeper,"It's been over four hours, I got a business to run-- As they argue, we're back following the happy face pin, as the water carries it to a DRAIN-- --when someone picks the pin up. We're in this person's POV as he studies the pin for a moment before pocketing it. We never see his face. We move from his POV-- --to across the street, arriving at a NEWS STAND. People at the news stand stare at. the crime scene. At the cop still arguing with the shopkeeper, the patrol cars, the yellow tape. At the MEDICAL EXAMINER zipping up Blake's BODY BAG. Other people at the news stand ignore the scene and peruse the magazines and periodicals, most of which have inflammatory headlines regarding the tense atmosphere currently in the world--a Newsweek headline reads ""War?"", The New York Times: ""China Moves Battleships near Taiwanese Waters,"" The New York Post, over a PHOTO of the President with Dr. Manhattan: ""What Me Worry?"" The NEWS VENDOR notices a MAN frowning at the papers."
news vendor, Depressing ain't it?
man,"But good for business, right?"
news vendor,Yeah. Irony's a bitch. The man pays for a newspaper when A HOMELESS MAN taps the News Vendor on the shoulder.
homeless man,"The current issue of The New Frontiersman, where is it?"
news vendor,It's late this month.
homeless man,When will it be here?
news vendor,"I dunno, pal, like I said, it's late-- We MOVE BACK ACROSS THE STREET, to Blake's apartment building, then MOVE UP the building, to the broken glass window Blake was thrown out of. We MOVE INTO THE WINDOW--"
cop 1,You sure it wasn't the wind?
cop 2,"Nah, I definitely heard something."
cop 1,"I tell ya, I'd rather do traffic duty than be posted at a crime scene all night. Watch the door. Cop 1 pulls his gun, going through the motions rather than being concerned. He then enters the bedroom. Cop 2 stands guard, nervous From the bedroom:"
hollis,"All the nuts that started popping up, I'll tell ya. Who was that midget you and your partner chased down years ago? What'd he call himself?"
dan,The Big Figure.
hollis,"Big Figure. A midget bad guy. Guess it doesn't get lower than that, does it? Hollis laughs at his own joke; Dan chuckles, polite."
dan," Wow, it's really late. Dan stands, finishes his beer. Hollis sees him to the door."
hollis,"Well, even though I spent my time catching real bad guys, you were still a better Nite Owl than I ever was."
dan,"That's bullshit, Hollis, and you know it. They hug."
hollis,"With all this talk of war, all that's going on in the world, it's a shame the government forced all you guys out. Before Dan can answer he notices a breaking news report on the TV:"
anchorwoman,"This just in--masked vigilante Rorschach has assaulted a New York City police officer who was guarding a crime scene in the early morning hours. Rorschach is on the FBIs ten most wanted list for violation of the Keene Act, which banned masked heroes ten years ago. Dan and Hollis watch as an image of Rorschach flashes on screen."
hollis,"Well, forced all of you guys out except one."
gang leader,Move your leg.
dan,What?
gang leader,"I said move, dick. Dan finally realizes what he's talking about. Dan meets his eyes, for just a moment and draws back his leg. The Gang Members snicker at Dan as they pass."
dan,"Rorschach. Rorschach sits at the table, mask half up, eating a cold CAN"
rorschach,Hello Daniel. I helped myself to some beans. You don't mind?
dan,"No, of course not. You uh, want me to heat some up for you?"
rorschach,No need.
dan,You were on the news. They say you attacked a cop.
rorschach,Minor wound. Won't need hospitalization.
dan,Other than that . How have you been keeping?
rorschach,"Out of prison. So far. Look at this. He tosses Blake's happy face pin onto the table. Dan picks it up, runs his fingers over the RED-BROWN SPLOTCH."
dan,"This little stain, is that bean juice or--"
rorschach,Human bean juice. It belonged to the Comedian. He's dead.
dan,"The Comedian? Nervous now, Dan glances out the window. DAN  Let's talk downstairs."
dan,How did it happen?
rorschach,Murder. Someone threw him out a window.
dan,Maybe it was a burglary. The killer might not have known who Blake was.
rorschach,An ordinary burglar? Kill the Comedian? Ridiculous.
dan,You're right. I heard he was working for the government. Maybe it was a political killing.
rorschach,Maybe. Or maybe someone's decided to kill off costumed heroes.
dan,You don't think that's . a little paranoid?
rorschach,Is that what they're saying about me now? That I'm paranoid?
dan,"I-'m just saying the Comedian made a lot of enemies over the years, even amongst his friends, if he had any. The man wasn't exactly endearing. Just because something happened to him doesn't mean it involves us."
rorschach,"One of our own has been murdered. I thought you might be interested. An attack on one is an attack on all of us, right? Dan hesitates."
dan,"I'm out, Rorschach. I've been out, we've all been out. Except you. You know that."
rorschach,"Yes. I know that. Anyways, I thought I'd let you know. Just in case."
dan,"Yeah, thanks. You can take the tunnel out to the warehouse on Fleet street-- Rorschach turns to walk off down a long, dark TUNNEL."
rorschach,I remember. Used to come here a lot. Back when we were partners.
dan,"Yeah. Those were good times, Rorschach. Great times.  What ever happened to them?"
rorschach,"You quit. Rorschach disappears into the SUBWAY TUNNEL, leaving Dan to reminisce alone. Dan glances at his old costume hanging."
hooker,So tell me what you wanna do. Sir.
army officer,"Seeing that I don't have to be back to base till Friday--everything. He puts a stack of BILLS on the dresser. Then takes his UNIFORM off like he can't wait. The Hooker gets on top of him- --when the DOOR FLIES OFF THE HINGES. Rorschach steps in, yanks the Hooker off-- --the officer gets to his feet, throws a punch, which Rorschach dodges. Rorschach GRABS the guy's arm, then KICKS the Officer on the side of his KNEE, tearing the joint to shreds. The Officer cries out in pain, falls to the floor-- Rorschach nails him in the head with a BLACK JACK, knocking him out. The Hooker screams. Rorschach grabs her by the hair and SLAMS her face into the wall."
rorschach,"Quiet, whore."
dan,I'm here to see Adrian Veidt.
assistant,Do you have an appointment?
dan,"No, uh, just tell him Dan Dreiberg is here to see him."
assistant,"I'm sorry, Mr. Veidt doesn't see anyone without an appointment."
dan,"I understand, but if you would just tell Adrian that Dan Dreiberg is here, I'm an old friend."
assistant,"Well, Mr. Veidt is very busy at the"
dan,"Just tell him I'm here. I assure you he'll see me. Dan glares at her. She glares right back. A game of chicken. She reluctantly gets up, goes inside the office. Once she's gone, Dan's glare disappears, replaced by nervousness. Because he's not sure if Adrian will see him-- it's been a long time. He glances at the SECURITY GUARDS eyeing him. Finally, the Assistant returns."
assistant,"Go on in, Mr. Dreiberg."
doug roth,"Mr. Veidt, would you acknowledge that you are considered the world's smartest man?"
doug roth,"If we could move off the subject of business for a moment, I'm curious whether the world's smartest man thinks we're headed for our next World War. Adrian stops the treadmill, towels off as he heads to Dan."
adrian,"Predicting stock prices isn't the same as predicting world events. I hope there isn't a war, or even a skirmish for that matter. Because Veidt Enterprises has some exciting plans, plans that will, pardon the cliche, truly make this world a better place. My team of engineers and scientists have been working with Dr. Manhattan himself on synthesizing a new, cheap form of energy which will eliminate the worlds reliance on fossil fuels with no toxic emissions. This energy could power cars, aircrafts, stadiums--there are no limitations-- "
dan,"You look good, Adrian."
adrian,Dan--it's been far too long.
adrian,Rorschach. He paid me a visit too.
dan,"He did? Must've been tough to get past your security, even for him. I thought your assistant was going to take me out."
dan,"You're the world's smartest man, Adrian. You tell me."
adrian,"Rorschach's a sociopath suffering through nostalgia. I revealed my identity to the public as soon as the Keene Act was passed. If an old enemy wanted me dead it would have been done already. Adrian notices the news on one of his TV projectors. Something about Pakistan putting troops along the Indian border. Adrian turns up the volume, looking grim."
pakistani soldier,"We should attack the Indian bastards. I don't understand-- CUT TO: POV--a SNIPER SCOPE, locked in on the Pakistani soldier."
chinese captain," --their blue abomination to intervene. And we don't want that. At the same time, we can't assume to know what's on the minds of our enemies. We're in Chinese waters, off the coast of Taiwan. The CHINESE CAPTAIN and his First Mate look out at the water. TAIWANESE GUNBOATS can be seen in the distance."
aide,Is Dr. Manhattan even real?
israeli officer,Why don't you ask the Vietnamese. Or the Iraqis? Dr. Manhattan is real. Thank god for that.
rorschach,"Dr. Manhattan. Dr. Manhattan continues about his business when his girlfriend, LAURIE JUPITER, 30, very much in her prime, enters from the other end."
laurie,"Jon, did you say some--Rorschach: What are you doing here? You're a wanted man."
rorschach,"Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre."
laurie,Don't call me that. My mother made me take that name. I always hated it.
rorschach,"Sorry, Miss Jupiter. I thought I should tell you the bad news--the Comedian has been murdered."
rorschach,I have my own theories. But neither of you seem too concerned.
laurie,"Well, I might not be able to count molecules, but either way, Blake was a bastard. You know he tried to rape my mother?"
rorschach,Sounds like you may have had a score to settle. You or your mother.
laurie,What? Are you accusing--
rorschach,--I'm not here to judge the moral discrepancies of a man who died in service of his country.
laurie,You call rape a moral discrepancy?!
rorschach,"I came here to warn you both, just like I warned Adrian and Dan. I believe someone may be targeting masked heroes--"
rorschach,"It took a lot of effort to get in here. I'm not leaving before I've-- With a look, Dr. Manhattan makes Rorschach disappear."
rorschach,"--had my say Rorschach realizes what just happened. Checks himself, his surroundings. Reorients himself. With nothing else he can do, he heads down the road."
yeah," Are you okay, Jon? Dr. Manhattan pauses for a moment, thoughtful."
laurie,Interference? Caused by what?
laurie,More war talk. I can't deal with this. I don't want to think about the future right now.
laurie,"--that time is simultaneous. There's no past to travel back to, no future to travel forward to, everything happens all at once, our actions affect the course of time instantly, yes I know."
laurie,"I know. I think I've been cooped up on this base for too long. Rorschach mentioned Dan Dreiberg--we haven't seen him in years. Maybe we can give him a call, see if he's available for dinner tonight."
agent forbes,"Going somewhere, Miss Jupiter?"
laurie,Out.
agent forbes,I'll have a car brought around in a few minutes.
laurie,"No, thank you. I called a cab already-- it's waiting for me outside. She tries to walk past but Agent Forbes steps in front of her."
agent forbes,You look quite nice. Who are you meeting?
laurie,An old friend of mine. And of Dr. Manhattan's. Now step out of my way.
agent forbes,"Please keep in mind, Ms. Jupiter, that your boyfriend is this country's most valuable asset. You need to keep him happy. And on our side. Laurie glares at him."
laurie,"Yes, sir. She brushes past him as she leaves."
laurie,"You remember that crazy guy, what did he call himself . Captain Carnage! Pretended to be a supervillian just so he could get beat up all the time?"
dan,"Yeah, he tried that with me once. I just walked away but he starts following me down the street in broad daylight yelling, ""punish me! punish me!"""
dan,"Uh, well, he pulled that on Rorschach and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft. They look at each other, serious, then explode in laughter."
laurie,"Sorry, sorry, that's not funny. I can't remember the last time I laughed like this. It feels good. Dan looks at her as she finishes her coffee. We can see he's smitten with her and that he probably has been for years. Laurie seems oblivious."
dan,"It's great seeing you again, Laurie."
laurie,"Yeah, this was fun. The WAITER arrives with the check; Laurie grabs it."
dan,You sure I can't get that?
laurie,Let me put my expense account to use. You can thank Uncle Sam.
dan,They've been watching the whole time?
laurie,Just making sure I'm not doing anything that might upset the country's most powerful weapon.
dan,"How is Jon, by the way?"
laurie,"I really don't know. It's been harder and harder to tell over the years. It's like his emotions are slowly eroding. To be honest, I can't tell if he even cares about me anymore. They're quiet a moment. Laurie glances at her watch."
laurie,"Y1 know, when I think back, why did we do it? Why did we dress up like that? I think the Keene Act was the best thing to ever happen to us."
dan,You're probably right.
laurie,"I mean, you remember my costume? All that tight spandex? That was awful."
dan,"Uh, yeah. Awful."
laurie,And to think my own mother pushed me into that spandex. Pushed me into the whole costume thing in the first place. Wanted her little girl to be just like mommy and fight bad guys.
dan,"Yeah. I'd really like that. Laurie crosses the street and gets into the sedan. As Dan watches the car drive off, TWO KIDS nearly bump into him, running around playing. The Kids make flying noises."
kid 1,"I'm Dr. Manhattan, saving the Twin Towers!"
kid 2,"No, I wanna be Dr. Manhattan!"
mother,"You can take turns, okay? Dan watches the Kids for a moment, then walks away. The Twin Towers looming behind him."
sally,Laurie? Is that you?
sally,I'd figure you'd be used to traveling that way by now.
laurie,"Well, I'm not. I hate it when Jon teleports me."
sally,Margarita?
laurie,"No. Sally pours herself a margarita from a pitcher on the counter. We see photos, remnants of Sally from her crimefighting days around the condo. Under the pitcher of margaritas is a days old LA Times with the headline: ""Dr. Manhattan Intercepts Terrorists At Port."""
sally,"It's Eddie Blake's funeral today, isn't it? Laurie nods.  FUNERAL: Blake's coffin is removed from the hearse."
laurie,Poor Eddie? How can you say that? After what he--
sally,"Laurie, you're still young. You don't understand how things change as time goes by. FUNERAL: Blake's coffin is carried past Adrian, Dan and Dr. Manhattan."
sally,"That leaves just two of the old team left. Me and Hollis Mason. She stops at Blake in the photo, regarding him."
blake,Me? I think it's hilarious.
blake,Fantastic. Just what I need.
vietnamese girl,The war is over now. We must talk.  About this.
blake,"There's nothing to talk about cuz I'm leaving. I'm gonna forget you and your horrible, sweaty little country. He turns away. Her eyes blaze with betrayal and hatred."
vietnamese girl,"No. You will remember. You will remember me and my country forever. She SMASHES a bottle. Blake turns just as the broken SHARDS SLASH HIS FACE, slicing him his jagged scar"
blake,You bitch! My face! He PUSHES HER into the bar and DRAWS HIS PISTOL--
blake,"That's right! And you know what? You watched me! You could've changed the gun into steam or the bullets into mercury or the bottle into snowflakes, but you didn't, did you? You're drifting outta touch, Doc--I've seen it. Don't tell me the war got to you. Blake walks off shouting ""Medic!"" Dr. Manhattan turns to the girl's body and regards it, curious. MATCH CUT TO:"
adrian,"What are you saying, Comedian? Blake, now in his forties, smokes a CIGAR, feet on the table, a FLASK in hand. The PAPER in his hand reads: ""Arab Leaders Call Dr. Manhattan: 'America's Weapon of Satan.""'"
blake,"What I'm saying is this whole bringing back the Watchmen thing is bullshit. It didn't work twenty years ago, and it ain't gonna work just because you want to keep on playing Cowboys and Indians."
dan,"Maybe we should agree on no drinking at meetings. Look, Rorschach and I have made real headway on the gang problem by pooling our efforts. Rorschach's voice is quiet, not yet its tortured rasp."
rorschach,That's true. But something like this seems too big. Too bureaucratic.
adrian,Bureaucracies can be effective with the right leadership--
blake,"And that would be you, right Veidt? I mean you're the ""smartest guy in the world,"" right?"
adrian,It doesn't take a genius to see that the world has problems.
blake,But it takes a roomful of morons to think they're small enough for you guys to handle. You people are a joke. You hear Moloch's back in town and get your panties in a bunch. You think that matters?
rorschach,Of course it does. Justice matters.
blake,"Justice. Hilarious. There's no such thing as justice. He stands, moving to Adrian's DISPLAY which outlines the Watchmen's agenda: GANGS, RACKETEERING, DRUGS. Blake flicks his ZIPPO and the display GOES UP IN FLAMES."
adrian,My display .
blake,"Justice doesn't matter, alright? Because twenty years from now we're all gonna be dust. Mankind's been trying to kill each other off since the beginning of time and now we finally got the power to finish the job. Ain't nothin' gonna matter when the nukes start flying, and I promise you they will. Then Ozymandias here is gonna be the smartest man on the cinder. He sneers and walks out. Silence. Uncomfortable in the wake of truth, the others pack up to go, muttering apologies to Adrian, but Adrian ignores them, staring at the flames flickering across his face. He seems more thoughtful than upset. MATCH CUT TO:"
blake,Crawl back in yer holes before you get hurt! I got rubber bullets!
blake,"Okay, that's how you wanna do it?! Smiling grimly, he FIRES TEAR GAS CANNISTERS INTO THE CROWD."
dan,Oh God. 
blake,"Hah! You seen this? The smoke clears enough for Dan to see a message SPRAY- PAINTED on a brick wall: ""WHO WATCHES THE WATCHMEN?"""
dan,How long can we keep this up?
blake,My government contacts tell me they're pushing some new bill through Congress.
dan,"Protection from what? Blake laughs, exultant in the blowing smoke, the chaos."
blake,Are you kidding? From themselves. CLOSE ON: the happy face pin on Blake's costume. MATCH CUT TO-
priest,"Lord have mercy upon us. Amen. Dan DROPS the pin into Blake's grave. The mourners linger a moment as dirt is shoveled onto Blake's casket, then start filing out. We follow one particular mourner all the way in the back--a LONE MAN, as he walks away."
rorschach,Edgar William Jacobi. Also known as Edgar William Vaughn. Also known as William Edgar Bright. Also known as Moloch.
moloch,What are you talking about? I'm a retired business maaAAAHHH!
rorschach,"Lie again, I'll break your arm."
moloch,"Oh God, please. I did my time. I'm not Moloch anymore. What do you want from me? Rorschach lets him go. Moloch's hollow eyes follow him."
rorschach,You attended a funeral today. Why?
moloch,The funeral? I don't know why I went. I just felt I should. I'd been thinking about the Comedian-- Rorschach SLAMS Moloch against the wall.
rorschach,How did you know Blake was the Comedian?
moloch,"He broke in here! A week ago! He, he had his mask off. He was drunk--"
rorschach,You were enemies for forty years. Why would he visit you?
moloch,I don't know! I woke up in my bedroom and there he was! He was upset! Crying!
rorschach,The Comedian? Crying?
moloch,"He, he was babbling, not making sense. I was pissing in my pants--I thought he was going to kill me!"
rorschach,What did he say?!
moloch,"He said he was wrong. About it all being a joke, that it wasn't funny anymore. He said he was scared--"
rorschach,Scared of what?!
moloch,"Something he saw, I think. He said something about wishing he never broke into that building. But that he had to keep his mouth shut. Then, then he left! Rorschach studies Moloch a moment, then releases him."
rorschach,"Hm. Funny story. Sounds unbelievable. Probably true. Rorschach glances around the kitchen. He opens some drawers, looking inside. He picks up a stack of MAIL, flips through it. One of the envelopes contains a PENSION CHECK from ""Pyramid Industries."""
moloch,So that's it? I'm clean?
rorschach,Clean? I searched your house. Found illegal drugs.
moloch,Illegal--I don't use drugs. Rorschach pulls a PILL BOTTLE from his coat.
rorschach,Laetril. Phony medication made from apricot pits. Illegal.
moloch,"oh c-come on. Look, please don't confiscate that. I'm trying anything . I have cancer."
rorschach,What kind of cancer?
moloch,The kind you don't get better from.
rorschach,"Fine. You're off the hook, for now. If you remember anything else, leave me a note in the trash can opposite the Gunga Diner at Fortieth and Seventh. Keep out of trouble, Moloch."
laurie,Mmm. What time do you have to be at your TV interview?
laurie,"Hey, your finger, it's like licking a battery. It's all-- She opens her eyes. They widen in shock and horror as she sees TWO DR. MANHATTANS in bed with her."
laurie,"Forget about it. I overreacted. It was just strange to see-- Laurie can now see into the KITCHEN, where yet a THIRD DR. MANHATTAN is working on an experiment. Her eyes blaze."
laurie,Understand!? You're working in here at the same time we're in bed!?
laurie,Shut up! Just SHUT YOUR MOUTH! Laurie WHIPS a full BEAKER at 3's chest. It PASSES THROUGH HIM and SMASHES IN THE KITCHEN SINK. Laurie storms out.
laurie,"Human emotion? You were human once. That's the problem, Jon. You've forgotten that."
dan,Who is it?
dan,Laurie? It takes a few moments for him to open the door.
laurie,I left Jon.
dan,"Did, uh, the Secret Service follow you here?"
laurie,I lost them in the subways. I think.
dan,"I'm really sorry, Laurie."
laurie,"Living with him . Dan, you don't know what it's been like. INTERCUT TO: Dr. Manhattan, holding Laurie's BRA. Staring."
laurie,I hope I didn't ruin your night.
dan,"Not at all. I was just going to see Hollis for our weekly beer session. You're more than welcome to join. In fact, I insist They pass the news stand from the opening scene. The Homeless Man is arguing with the News Vendor:"
news vendor,"--I told you, this month's issue still hasn't arrived yet! Why do you care about that right wing rag so much? Cuz those bastards don't give a damn about you, pal! They--hold up, here it comes. They turn as SEYMOUR, a fat slob of a man, arrives with a BUNDLE of the latest issue of ""The New Frontiersman."" CUT TO: Dr. Manhattan stepping THROUGH and INTO the empty, floating suit. His TIE knots itself. Dr. Manhattan looks around the empty room . sad? Again, he looks at the photo of him and Janey Slater . . then"
dan,"Laurie, will you please stop apologizing? I'm here for you anytime. SHADOWS trail behind them, ominous. Someone's following."
laurie,I know. I just find it rude when people show up at your door--
producer,Terrific. Dr. Manhattan arrives and no one thinks to tell me?
receptionist,"He, he just--"
producer,All geez. We don't have time for make-up. That blue is too light for television. The light from Dr. Manhattan's SKIN DARKENS to a DEEPER BLUE.
producer,"Uh, yeah"
press agent,"Just another reminder that if the second Geneva Convention comes up, our official position is that talks will not resume until the Chinese agree to exclude you from the agenda. The President approved this interview because he wanted to strengthen morale at home and to gently remind the rest of the world who holds the cards. Please keep that in mind. Dr. Manhattan stands off stage, waiting. The LIGHTS come up and we're live with the glossy NEWS HOST."
news host,"He's been called many things; Hero, weapon, linchpin of our security-- CUT TO: Dan and Laurie turning as the Young Thugs BLOCK THE ALLEYWAY. One of the Thugs pulls a KNIFE. Laurie and Dan exchange a look. Dan removes his glasses. CUT BACK TO:"
news host,"Thank you, Dr. Manhattan, and not simply for appearing on this program. I believe I speak for all of America when I thank you for thwarting the terrorist plot at the port of Long Beach over a week ago-- Furious applause from the audience, which Dr. Manhattan regards curiously."
news host,"Before we start, I want to explain to our viewers the unconventional format for this interview. Our live audience is made up entirely of news media and Dr. Manhattan will be taking questions from the floor. This commercial free broadcast is presented to you by Veidt Enterprises. We see Adrian standing near the audience with the Press Agent, smiling for the camera."
doug roth,"Dr. Manhattan, Doug Roth, Nova Times. Do you remember a man named Wally Weaver?"
doug roth,He died of cancer.
doug roth,"How about Edgar Jacobi, also known as the supervillian Moloch? You had a lot of battles with him, didn't you? Did you know that he has cancer as-well? The News Host looks confused. Adrian turns to the Press Agent, growing concerned with where this is leading. CUT TO: Dan, snapping the GUNMAN'S wrist back and up-- Barrel aimed at the Thug's CHIN. In the last fraction of a second, Dan SHIFTS the gun two inches left as it FIRES, deafening the Thug, but leaving him alive. BACK TO:"
doug roth,And what about Jose Flores? He was the longtime janitor at the Watchmen Headquarters where you worked for many years. Cancer.
doug roth,"You tell me, doc. Adrian turns to him."
adrian,"Doug, that `s enough."
doug roth,Irrelevant?
doug roth,What about Janey Slater? Do you think it makes a difference to her?
doug roth,"Your ex-girlfriend, she was a physicist too. You were with her for ten years. Or does she have to remind you herself? Suddenly Janey Slater emerges from a door at the top of the stands. She is old now, frail, barely recognizable from the images we've see of her."
janey slater,"D-damn you, Jon. God damn you"
adrian,"We need to stop this now. Adrian and the Press Agent hurry on stage, SECURITY following."
press agent,"That's it! Interview's over! BACK TO: The alley, littered with the unconscious BODIES of the Thugs. Laurie and Dan lean back on the wall, gasping for air, horribly out of shape, but victorious. CUT TO: The TV studio, as Adrian and Security surround Dr. Manhattan, trying to escort him out. The audience spills out of the stands, RUSHING Dr. Manhattan with questions and, FLASHING cameras--it's madness. Adrian shoves a camera out of Dr. Manhattan's face."
adrian,"As the sponsor of this program I demand all cameras off! His plea is futile, of course. A REPORTER breaks through, gets in Dr. Manhattan's face."
reporter 1,Did you give Ms. Slater cancer by sleeping with her?
reporter 2,Do you even care about human life?
adrian,Everyone back off! Don't you understand? He's the only thing preventing the world from chaos!
doug roth,How many other people did you do this to? Dr. Manhattan finally SNAPS--
laurie,"I should find a hotel. God. Imagine, us getting mugged."
dan,Why don't you come by Hollis' with me? Shake off the adrenaline.
laurie,"No thanks, I've had enough hero stuff for one night.  You take care, Dan. It's a dangerous world out there."
hollis,You're late.
dan,"I know, you won't believe it--"
hollis,You missed it--Dr. Manhattan just lost it on live TV.
dan,"Wait, what? Dan turns to the TV, which replays the clip of Dr. Manhattan being accosted and then teleporting everyone to the roof."
hollis,She'll know soon enough. The whole world will know.
laurie,"You're the Comedian, right? You were pretty cool in there. Blake lights a smoke, looks her over."
blake,You got your mom's eyes. Even that funny little mole.
laurie,Got another smoke?
blake,"She was one of the all-time champion beauties, your mom. She talk about me much?"
laurie,"No. Not really. As Blake gives her a light, Laurie touches his hand to cover the lighter from the wind. She looks up at him, sly."
blake,Hey Doll. Long time no see.
sally,"Not long enough in my book, Eddie. She eyes Laurie with cool death."
blake,"Christ, we were just talking! Can't a guy talk to his, y'know, friend's daughter? What the hell do you think I am?"
sally,"I know what you are, Eddie. I've always known. Don't ever forget that. Driving off, Laurie watches Blake through the window--"
agent forbes,"Ms. Jupiter, you need to come with us now."
laurie,"I don't understand, what do you mean, Jon's gone?"
agent forbes,"I mean he snapped and disappeared during the interview. Now our trackers can't detect him anywhere on the planet. If we want to find him you're our only hope. A TECHNICIAN wires Laurie up; GRAPHS record Laurie's neural responses, MONITORS show satellite images."
technician 1,"Miss Jupiter, we need you to visualize Dr. Manhattan. Do you need a prompt?"
laurie,No.
technician 2,Neurotransmissions tracking.
technician 3,Transmitting on all frequencies.
technician 1,"We're ready Miss Jupiter. We need you to try and talk to him. Laurie, wired like a porcupine, seems embarrassed."
laurie,"Jon? Jon, can you hear me? The GRAPH-NEEDLES jump and tick, searching . when a high, clear TONE rings through the room. Needles fly. Technicians dash to lock it down. Agent Forbes hurries to the graph, looking over their shoulders."
agent forbes,Have you got him?
technician 1,"We've located his signal, yes."
agent forbes,"Well? Where the hell is he? The Technician looks up, not happy about the answer."
technician 1,He's on Mars.
janey slater,"Aww, Jon, look--you've got cotton candy on the side of your mouth"
jon osterman,"You do too. Here, let me get it for you. He pulls her close. They giggle like the young lovers they are and then kiss, passionate BACK TO: Dr. Manhattan walking on mars' surface. He approaches a LARGE ROCK FORMATION which blocks his path. He PARTS the rock formation telekinetically, like Moses parting the sea-- --and we FLASHBACK, mirroring the parting of the rock formation to the parting of two SLIDING DOORS, in the LAB OF A NUCLEAR TESTING FACILITY, as Jon steps into the REACTOR"
janey slater,"The time lock, Jon! As it dawns on Jon, he hears the hum of the REACTOR INITIATING, the big mechanical parts moving. Jon runs to the door, BANGS on it."
jon osterman,"Janey: Oh my god! TEARS stream down Janey's face as she looks at him through the thick glass, helpless, hopeless. Inside, the chamber starts to GLOW ."
janey slater,"I'm sorry, Jon, I can't-- Janey can't bear to watch--she runs out of the lab as the reactor initiates"
janey slater,Oh god . Jon is that you?
agent forbes,"There must be some way to contact him. Laurie sits in the room, largely forgotten."
laurie,Agent Forbes.
agent forbes, What?
laurie,"I need to go to the bathroom. Agent Forbes gives her a look, then waves for a SECRET SERVICE AGENT to escort her."
laurie,You're getting me out of here.
laurie,Don't you understand that sitting there with a bunch of high tech radios and monitors isn't going to bring him back?
dan,Jesus! Rorschach
rorschach,"Good morning, Daniel. I brought in your paper. Dan reads the headline: ""DR. MANHATTAN LEAVES EARTH."""
dan,My new lock?
rorschach,"Get a stronger one, Daniel. You can't be too security conscious these days."
aide,"--three synagogues were bombed in Tel Aviv, a bus exploded in Jerusalem--"
israeli officer,Enough!
president,"Forget picking sides--first, are we safe?"
president,I want the National Guard put on the border. As for the rest of it . let's not jump into the fray just yet.
president,"Let's just wait, okay?! Maybe he'll come back.  Maybe he'll come back."
assistant,"Clock's ticking, Mr. Veidt."
adrian,"I know. I'm meeting the toy people, yes?"
assistant,"Eleven-thirty. They want to talk to you about some new villains for the ""Ozymandias"" line."
adrian,All the old villains are dead.
assistant,What's with everybody today? Everyone's on this death trip.
adrian,"I suppose the threat of war has that effect. ACROSS THE WAY, Dan enters the building, intercepts Adrian."
dan,"Adrian, I need to talk to you. Adrian looks put off."
adrian,"Dan, I'm sorry, this is a bad time."
dan,But what about what happened with ion? Adrian excuses himself from his Assistant.
adrian,"Jon's departure is terrible. Not only for what's happening in the world now, but for what could have happened. The energy project he and I were working on--it's dead now ."
dan,Rorschach came to see me again. Maybe there's something to this mask killer thing.
adrian,"Are you still preoccupied with the ramblings of that lunatic? I really don't have time for this, Dan."
personal assistant,Sometimes I can't bear to watch the news. It makes it so hard to be optimistic Is that a gun? Dan sees what's happening--
dan,"Adrian! BANG! The man SHOOTS the Assistant in the gut; Adrian immediately springs into action--he moves with unbelievable speed and quickness, grabbing a velvet ROPE-STANCHION-- --DEFLECTING A SECOND BULLET with it-- --and SMASHING IT INTO THE FACE OF THE ASSASSIN, knocking him into a FOUNTAIN. SECURITY GUARDS run, guns drawn, toward the fountain where Adrian GRAPPLES with the dazed man."
security guard,Mr. Veidt! Let us handle it!
adrian,"Wait, he's got a poison capsule! He JAMS his fingers into the Assassin's mouth when Dan arrives."
laurie,Oh my god. Where's Adrian now?
dan,Talking to the cops. Thank god he's still in great shape. You get so caught up with the whole smartest man in the world thing you forget what a physical specimen he is- -he's as fast as I've ever seen him
laurie,I'm not sure. I can't go stay with my mom- -I'm sure that's the first place they'll look. But I need to get out of the city. It's only a matter of time before they find me.
dan,"Listen, why don't you . how about you stay at my place?"
laurie,"Oh, Dan, I couldn't impose--"
dan,"It wouldn't be an imposition, I have an extra room. We're friends. And with everything that's been happening"
laurie,"You're buying into Rorschach's ""mask killer"" theory?"
dan,"I don't know. But it can't hurt to be safe. Besides, I've already had one wanted person visit me, another one won't make a difference. They look at each other. Laurie smiles."
laurie,Okay.
rorschach,"Somebody tried to shoot the world's smartest man today, Moloch. Moloch sits at the kitchen table. CLOSE ON: MOLOCH'S HAND. An ignored CIGARETTE smolders. In his other hand, a NOTE."
rorschach,No.
rorschach,"No. No, no, no"
rorschach,"Framed. Set up. Walked right into it. Stupid, stupid, stupid."
rorschach,Heh. Never. Never surrender. Rorschach takes an AEROSOL CAN and a PEPPER SHAKER.
rorschach,When you are
shit,The HOOK BLOWS THE BODY-ARMORED COP OVER THE RAILING.
rorschach,Ten years. I've waited for this. He beckons them forward. The cops PILE INTO HIM. Rorschach brutally disables six cops before he is overwhelmed.
fine,Get that mask off him!
cop 1,"I got it. Christ, he stinks!"
rorschach,No no no NO NO NO! The Cop peels back the shifting mask to reveal the Homeless Man from the news stand. He screams at them wildly.
laurie,What time is it?
dan,"Noon. Thought I'd let you sleep in. Laurie smiles at him. Is Dan crazy or does he sense a spark? She touches his shoulder as she turns into the living room, then turns on the TV:"
anchorwoman,"Today, police searched the apartment of Walter Kovacs, better known as the masked vigilante Rorschach. Kovacs was captured last night and charged with the murder of Edgar Jacobi, formerly known as the supervillain Moloch. Moloch was found shot in the head at point blank range. Both Dan and Laurie stop what they're doing, eyes fixed on the TV: They see Rorschach, unmasked, IN SHACKLES."
editor,Rorschach is an American patriot and we are proud that he reads this publication.
anchorwoman,"During his capture, Kovacs assaulted and severely injured at least nine police officers, shooting one officer with a grappling gun. That officer is in serious but stable condition."
anchorman,"Meanwhile, in Kashmir, fighting continues to intensify. Both India and Pakistan alluded that the use of nuclear weapons is not out of the question-- Laurie shuts off the TV, not wanting to hear the war talk."
laurie,That mask's eaten Rorschach's brains away.
dan,"He wasn't always like that. We were a great team--tactically, he was brilliant. But I don't know, something about this murder charge I just can't see Rorschach shooting Moloch."
laurie,He shot a cop with a grappling gun.
dan,"Don't remind me, I made that thing for him. But a regular gun just seems too . ordinary"
laurie,"And this war, god. Sometimes I wish I could just leave the planet. Like Jon."
dan,Oh sure. The old Manhattan Transfer.
laurie,"Now, that's funny. That's what you call Jon's teleportation?"
dan,"Well, not to his face. Laurie laughs."
psychiatrist,Walter Kovacs. Is that your name? Walter?
rorschach,"No. The Psychiatrist sits back, considering Rorschach carefully."
psychiatrist,"Let me explain your situation here, Walter. If you cooperate with me, I may be able to convince them that you should to be treated medically, in a hospital, which I believe is best for you. But the authorities want to put you in General Population."
rorschach,A prison is a prison.
psychiatrist,"Yes, but the difference is, downstairs? They'll eat you alive. He holds up a RORSCHACH BLOT-CARD."
rorschach,A pretty butterfly. The Psychiatrist holds up another blot-card.
psychiatrist,"How about this one? What do you see here? FLASH OF: Rorschach, as a LITTLE BOY, watching his MOTHER, HALF NAKED, EMBRACE A MAN AS HE HANDS HER SOME MONEY. When she catches Rorschach interrupting, she SMACKS him in the face. Shuts the door on him."
rorschach,"Some nice flowers. The Psychiatrist eyes him, dubious. Holds up another card. FLASH OF: Rorschach as a little boy looking up at TWO OLDER BOYS, teasing him. Calling him ""son of a whore."" Rorschach just wants to be left alone when one of the Boys SPITS in his face. Suddenly, Rorschach's face changes. He attacks the Boy like a wild animal--biting, clawing ."
psychiatrist,Tell me about Rorschach. Will you do that?
rorschach,"Why are you here with me, doctor?"
psychiatrist,Because I want to make you well.
rorschach,"There's other men in here with behavior more extreme than mine. Of course, they're not famous. You want to know about Rorschach, doctor? I'll tell you about Rorschach"
child molester,You think I had something to do with that girl? I didn't! Where's your evidence? Rorschach calmly points to body of the dog. 
rorschach,"Men get arrested. Rorschach RAISES THE CLEAVER, high over his head"
rorschach,"A tremor of impact shook my arm. Warm blood splashed my face. It was Walter Kovacs who screamed, who closed his eyes-- it was Rorschach who opened them again. The silence reels out RORSCHACH  You see, Doctor. God didn't kill that little girl, fate didn't butcher her and destiny didn't feed her to those dogs. If God saw what any of us did that night, he didn't seem to mind. From then on, I knew. God doesn't make the world this way. We do. The Psychiatrist rises shakily. He crosses to the GUARD."
psychiatrist,I can't help him.
random voice,"Hey Rorschach, I heard your momma was a whore! A cruel RIPPLE OF LAUGHTER and the mass conversation begins again as Rorschach takes his place in the food line. A HUGE PRISONER moves in behind him. He whispers:"
prisoner,"Hey, Rorschach. You're pretty famous, right? Y'know, I'm pretty famous too. Maybe I can give you my autograph. The Prisoner slides a SHIV from his sleeve"
rorschach,None of you understand. I'm not locked up in here with you. Rorschach is placidly dragged off INTO DARKNESS
laurie,All these gadgets and there isn't even a dash lighter She hits a BUTTON--the lights inside go DIM. Creepy. She hits the button again to turn the lights back on but nothing
dan,"Laurie?! Dan BOLTS for the basement door, thoughts of the mask-killer on his mind."
laurie,I'm so sorry--I hit the wrong button. I was looking for the lighter in.there.
dan,I don't smoke. Are you hurt?
laurie,"I'm fine, but your ship--"
dan,"Ah, that's mostly just soot. Archie's pretty resilient."
laurie,Archie?
laurie,Still with the mask-killer theory? Rorschach is insane.
dan,"Maybe, but the Comedian murdered; Jon exiled; Someone tries to shoot Adrian; Rorschach gets arrested. It makes me uneasy."
laurie,How did you ever afford all this?
dan,My Dad was in corporate banking. He left me quite a bit. Which always surprised me.
laurie,How did he die?
dan,"Mugging. He was shot. As Dan cleans up, Laurie watches him, like she's seeing him for the first time."
laurie,"You really do worry about me, don't you?"
dan,"Huh? Well, yeah, of course I worry about you, I mean, we're, y'know, friends-- Laurie takes off his glasses . and KISSES him. It's what Dan's been wanting all this time . but he pulls away."
laurie,"What's wrong? But Dan is already walking up the stairs, pathetic. Laurie's left there, alone. The Owl-Costume looming in the background."
rorschach,Big Figure. Small world.
big figure," I like that. But you know, it is a small world in here. I've been in it for--how long now, Billy?"
dumb thug,"Twenty years, Mr. Figure."
big figure,"That's right. Twenty years since you and that owl fella put me away. Rorschach-- that guy you burned is dying. Could go any minute now. And when he does, this place is gonna explode. Then you die by inches."
rorschach,Tall order.
fat thug, I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole!
big figure,"Relax, Lloyd. Soon. Chuckling, Big Figure walks off down the long, shadowed corridor. Rorschach continues staring, straight ahead."
laurie,"Dan? Is everything okay? I heard you coming down the stairs Descending the stairs, she finds Dan before his costume, naked. He fiddles with an OWL-WING THROWING WEAPON."
dan,"Mask killers. War. Nuclear annihilation. I feel so powerless, so I've been afraid of this damn costume. Afraid of how much I need it. He FLINGS the owl wing crescent, whizzing into the dark."
laurie,So. Let's take the ship out.
dan,What?
laurie,"Who's to know? I used to be a ""masked avenger"" too, remember? I'm used to getting up at three in the morning to do something stupid. Besides, I'm already a wanted lady, you're already in trouble for hiding me, how much more trouble can we be in? Just give me a second--can't go out like this. She jogs upstairs. Dan turns to the empty, waiting suit."
dan,"I can't believe it still fits. Luckily I constructed it with material that was elastic and-- Dan turns as Laurie appears at the door, decked in her BLACK SPANDEX. SILK SPECTRE, looking every bit as good as seventeen-"
laurie,I'm ready. Dan turns and sees his reflection in the owl-Ship's window.
dan,Me too.
dan,Let's have some cloud cover.
laurie,It's so beautiful
dan,"Hang on. Dan BANKS, wheeling the ship toward the VELDT BUILDING."
laurie,"Look! Below, a TENEMENT BUILDING is ENGULFED IN FLAME. Dan's jaw sets. He wheels the ship around and down. As they zoom closer, they can see people SCREAMING from the windows."
dan,I'm putting the water cannons on the lower stories. 
laurie,I'm on it. Nite Owl.
laurie,"Hi. If you could all form a line, we'll have you out of here in just a moment. ATOP THE SHIP: Dan latches the steering column into its roof socket. He stands; Takes a deep, chest-expanding breath. Who has he been kidding? This is who he is. Flicking a switch OLD JAZZ plays pleasantly."
laurie,Anybody want coffee?
laurie,I can't believe we did that! That was actually fun
dan,"Yeah. He puts a hand on her shoulder. His eyes locked onto hers. He knows what he wants and this time he's not afraid of it He kisses her. Hard. Running her hands up his cheeks, they slide each other's masks off. Their mouths melt together."
laurie,"It was good, wasn't it?"
dan,"Yeah, saving those people from the fire. Taking Archie out Laurie swats him on the chest--that's not what she meant. Dan grins, having fun with her."
laurie,"So . what do we do next? Dan sits up, serious. Very serious."
dan,I've been thinking about that. And I believe we have certain obligations to our fraternity.
big figure,"He's dead, Rorschach--the riot's already begun. While everyone's distracted, we thought we'd bring you a housewarming gift. Something from the machine shop. The Fat Thug wheels an ELECTRICAL WELDER to the door. Rorschach sits, idly TEARING his PRISON SHIRT into STRIPS."
fat thug,"Hey Boss, y'notice? None of that ""small world, tall order"" crap, cuz he knows once we slice open this lock, he's next on the block."
rorschach,"Fat chance. The Fat Thug reddens. He DIVES forward, HANDS SWIPING for Rorschach."
fat thug,"You're dead, Rorschach! We got a prison full of killers out here! What've you got? Rorschach SPINS, WRAPPING A SHIRT-STRIP AROUND HIS WRISTS, trapping the Fat Thug's hands inside the cell."
rorschach,Your hands. My pleasure. Rorschach SNAPS Fat Thug's pinky fingers. Fat Thug SHRIEKS. Rorschach roughly binds the fingers around the bars. Dumb Thug tries to reach the welder around Fat Thug's body.
dumb thug,I can't reach the lock. Should I cut the bars?
big figure,"This riot won't last. And I've been waiting twenty years for this Big Figure nods to the Dumb Thug, who then grabs Fat Thug's neck."
dumb thug,"Nothing personal, big guy."
fat thug,"Boss, you can't be serious! Wait-- Dumb Thug SNAPS Fat Thug's neck. He then CUTS OFF Fat Thug's hands with the welder, pushes the corpse out of the way to reach the lock. Big Figure grins at Rorschach."
big figure,Now you find out what the score is.
rorschach,One-nothing. Come and get me.
laurie,"Look, Dan, I'm glad you were able to rediscover your calling in life, but I think you're getting carried away. You're talking about springing a homicidal psychopath from prison."
dan,"Rorschach may be sick, but I think he's on to something--four heroes attacked in a week is not a coincidence. I mean, that whole cancer thing with ion, does that make sense to you? You didn't contract cancer from him. He says as Laurie's about to light a cigarette. She changes her mind."
laurie,Why would someone want to drive ion away? Look what's happening now. With Jon gone it looks like we're headed for another World War. Who would want that?
dan,I don't know. But I know someone who might be able to help. Dan lands the Owl-Ship on the roof.
dan,You're leaving town? So you do believe Rorschach's theory.
adrian,"Please. Right now, I'm not concerned with this so-called mask-killer, I'm concerned with the mass killer called war, or have you not heard.  On ! A WALL SIZED MIRROR turns into a TV:"
cnn newscaster,--US Aircraft Carriers have already moved into the Persian Gulf and US Battleships have left Japan en route to the Far East
laurie,"It's happening Dan breaks away from the terrible news, follows Adrian."
dan,All the more reason we need to get to the bottom of this. Maybe we can get Jon to come back in the process and stop all this madness.
adrian,Nothing we do will bring Jon back!  But I think you know that already. And breaking Rorschach out of prison certainly isn't the answer.
dan,"Rorschach's been the only one investigating this from the start. Without him, we're starting at the beginning and we don't have that kind of time. We need your help, Adrian."
adrian,"I'm leaving, Dan. And I suggest you both do the same. Adrian pulls on a thick WINTER COAT and heads upstairs."
dan,Where are you going to go?
adrian,"Antarctica. It takes Dan a moment to realize Adrian is serious. By then, Adrian's halfway into the helicopter."
big figure,"Hurry Lloyd! I wanna smell this sonofabitch cooking! The lock MELTS AWAY. Rorschach climbs onto his bunk as Dumb Thug enters, JABBING the electric welder at him menacingly. Rorschach drives his HEEL into the porcelain TOILET BOWL, SHATTERING IT. WATER SPILLS across the floor. Rorschach KICKS Dumb Thug in the stomach; Dumb Thug buckles, then SLIPS in the water--Dumb Thug falls, welder still in hand as he hits the water Dumb Thug's hand FUSES to the welder as ELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH HIM. He collapses, smoking. Dead."
rorschach,"Hmm. Never disposed of sewage with a toilet before. Obvious, really. Big Figure looks very small and alone now"
dan,You don't have to do this. I know the whole crimefighting thing wasn't necessarily your choice in life.
laurie,No. But this is. She moves next to him.
dan,"Hmm, Rorschach gets locked up in here and suddenly there's a riot. I wonder if that's a coincidence. They descend toward the hell of TEAR-GAS, FIRE and VIOLENCE. The Tower Guards, stunned at the sight of the Owl-Ship, begin SHOOTING at it. The bullets bounce right off."
laurie,How are we going to find Rorschach in all of this?
dan,"When he and I were partners, we each had tracking implants put under our skin so old Archie here could find us if either one of us were ever in trouble. Let's see if Rorschach kept his in. Dan turns on the GPS monitor. There's a BLIP on the screen."
laurie,"How do we know he's still alive? They come upon Rorschach's cell. Dan sees the SMOKING CORPSE of Dumb Thug. Sees the CUT OFF HANDS of Fat Thug, HANGING from the bars."
dan,He's alive.
laurie,Is that--
dan,Rorschach? Rorschach!
rorschach,"Hello, Daniel, Ms. Jupiter. Excuse me, I just have to visit the men's room. He disappears into the dark bathroom. Laurie watches after him in stunned disbelief."
laurie,"Oh, for Christ's sake."
dan,"Hey, it happens. I remember I lost a big arrest like that once. Had to redesign the costume after that-- Rorschach exits the bathroom, wiping his hands."
rorschach,We can leave now. He walks off.
laurie,Are you sure you're ready? We don't want to go diving head-first into things.
rorschach,Good Advice. I'm sure there are many who'd agree with you. Behind them: BLOODY WATER FLOODS from the bathroom door as they go.
rorschach,"Good to see you in uniform, Daniel. What happened? Finally taking the mask-killer seriously?"
laurie,I'm not.
rorschach,"Of course you haven't been attacked yet. Funny, most everyone else has."
laurie,"What's that supposed to mean? We came here to rescue you, asshole!"
dan,"Hey! Survive now! Argue later! I had to turn the screechers off, so we'll be drawing fire. The owl-Ship rises to the roof. They all jump in."
dan,"Rorschach, you remember how to handle Archie?"
rorschach,"I believe so. Rorschach sits in the pilot's seat. Dan turns to Laurie, high on adrenaline and love. Dan moves in to kiss her--"
dan,Give us a second--
rorschach,I don't think this can wait.
dan,"What? What is it Dan looks up, through the windshield, and sees-- --Dr. Manhattan WALKING ACROSS THE CLOUDS--STRAIGHT FOR THE"
laurie,"It `s him. The ship COLLIDES with Dr. Manhattan, who PASSES THROUGH into the CABIN with a SHOWER of BLUE PARTICLES--"
laurie,They said you were on Mars.
laurie,Where? What are you talking about?
dan,"Wait, what? You're taking her to Mars? No, she can't--Laurie, I don't know about"
this,Laurie looks at Dan then at Dr. Manhattan. Comprehending
laurie,"I have to go, Dan. Jon and I, we're going to talk. Maybe we'll find some way out of this mess the world's gotten itself in. I'll be okay. Really."
rorschach,"No time for heartbreak, Daniel."
dan,"Let's try and lose them in the city. He hits the jets, heading for the New York SKYLINE."
laurie,"J--huc? Hhhhhhh-- Laurie GRIPS her throat and TUMBLES down the hill. She rolls into Jon, waiting for her at the bottom. She CLAWS at him."
laurie,"Jon, you stupid bastard! Listen, you better not forget this air supply or whatever it is  Oh shit. Laurie stands up before Jon's huge GLASS PALACE."
dan,oh no.
rorschach,"Tactical error, Daniel."
dan,I know-- They head straight for the subway-- --when the tunnel opens up-- --Dan SWERVES to the adjacent track just in time.
dan,"Shit. Dan accelerates, weaving Archie around the skyscrapers, the Empire State Building . but the copter's still there. Dan cuts around the UNITED NATIONS BUILDING. The copter follows the Owl-Ship around to the East River . but the Owl-Ship is nowhere to be found The copter hovers there. Baffled."
gang leader,Rorschach? That fool put my cousin in a
gang leader,Does he now
hollis,"It's just like old times, Sal. Nite Owl and Silk Spectre back at it again. CUT TO: Sally Jupiter on the other end in California, watching the same footage."
sally,"I always knew Laurie had it in her. Sorry for waking you, Hollis."
hollis,"I may be retired from the costume, but my sleeping habits have never changed. There's a KNOCK at Hollis's door."
gang leader,"Then I'm probably doing him a favor. Hollis, old again, looks up. The SHADOW of the statue"
rorschach,I hate this. How long are we going to stay down here? Daniel! Dan says nothing. Rorschach puts on his costume.
dan,Hey! We took enough unnecessary risks bringing Archie up so you could get your spare costume. We stay put until it cools down out there--they're looking for us.
rorschach,"Unnecessary? Cowering in the sludge, from the authorities, that's unnecessary. Rorschach pulls his mask on, turns."
dan,"I know, you told me already. I'm tapping into all the databases, finding out about the company--"
rorschach,"Sitting at a computer? No. We need to trace the killer--hit up underworld contacts, squeeze people. You've forgotten how we do things. You've been lazing around too long."
dan,"Listen, I HAVE HAD IT! Who the hell do you think you are? You live off people while insulting them, and no one complains because they think you're a goddamn lunatic! Dan turns away, shaking. He leans against the console."
daniel,Dan turns. Rorschach holds out an open hand.
dan,"Hey forget it It's okay, man. Releasing his hand with some effort, Dan sits, invigorated."
laurie,You . know about me and Dan?
laurie,"Jon, I'm having enough problems right now without getting into your predestination crap."
laurie,"Because. If you already know the future, why were you surprised when I left you, or when that reporter ambushed you? Why even debate if you already know the outcome?"
laurie,"Agh! This is so typical of you! Do you know what a relief it is to be with somebody human, like Dan?"
laurie,But you already know . You said--
laurie,That's ridiculous. The Earth is too important to hinge on one relationship.
laurie,Are you doing this? I'm not in the mood for jokes.
rorschach,"You sure this is the correct location, Daniel?"
dan,Positive. Pyramid Industries. Specializes in industrial plastics. At least they did.
dan,"I tapped into all the databases--tax records, business registries, real estate records--trying to get a bead on who's behind Pyramid but it's a never ending paper trail. Rorschach investigates ahead when Dan catches some MOVEMENT-- --he turns his FLASHLIGHT to find a few HOMELESS PEOPLE squatting in the warehouse. Upon seeing Dan in.costume, the Homeless People run away."
rorschach,Daniel.
dan,"They're harmless, Rorschach."
rorschach,Daniel. Rorschach is looking down at something. Dan heads over and sees a DEAD BODY in the early stages of decomposition. He turns the body over--bullet between the eyes just like Moloch . but we recognize the corpse--it's journalist Doug Roth.
dan,"Hey, I know this man."
rorschach,Yes. Doug Roth. Journalist who grilled Dr. Manhattan on national television.
dan,No I didn't watch that interview. This was the guy who was doing a story on Adrian when I went to see him.
rorschach,"Hmm. Journalist set up Dr. Manhattan, was probably working to set up Veidt also. Dan stands there thinking. As if hit with an epiphany. He opens his mouth like he can't believe what he's going to say."
dan,"Rorschach. What, what if it's Adrian?"
rorschach,Veidt? Behind everything? Makes no sense.
dan,"On the surface it doesn't, but hear me out--Adrian's the only one who could've taken on the Comedian in hand to hand combat. He's the only one with the finances to create an entire company for the sole purpose of setting up Dr. Manhattan. And Adrian was directly involved in arranging that broadcast. He probably supplied this journalist with the whole cancer list."
rorschach,That doesn't explain the attempt on Veidt's life.
dan,"If we say that Adrian set that up himself, he could've had the hitman shoot his assistant first. It was a risk, but--"
rorschach,But why?
dan,I don't know. Let's go ask him.
head scientist,"Mr. Veidt, may I?"
adrian,"By all means, Eric."
head scientist,"I just would like to say that when I was first offered this position, I was hesitant. A multi-year commitment to work in Antarctica?"
adrian,"I certainly hope so. The group applauds. Then they sip their champagne. All except for Adrian The group goes around congratulating each other, when suddenly the Head Scientist COLLAPSES, choking. The others surround him, trying to help-- --when one by one they each start collapsing themselves-- POISONED by the champagne. Adrian regards them all, writhing on the floor, and leaves."
dan,"Something I can help you with, boys? They all spin around, frightened at the costume."
gang leader,"L-listen, I didn't mean to kill that old guy. Things just got outta hand"
dan,What old guy?
dan,"You're dead! You and the rest of your gang, you're all DEAD! You know how much fire-power I've got floating out there!? Oh god damn. Hollis. God damn god damn god damn Dan begins to break up. Rorschach quietly pulls him away."
rorschach,"Not now, Daniel."
editor,SEYMOUR! Is that Dulmage's editorial cartoon?
seymour,"It's the mail. Hey cool, someone sent us their journal."
editor,"War's coming, Seymour--I don't wanna hear some knob's life story! Chuck it in the crank file! Seymour tosses Rorschach's journal into a PILE OF LETTERS."
laurie,Can't you just tell me how this all ends and save us the trouble?
laurie,Tears. You mean I lose? You don't come back to Earth?
laurie,"You mean there's going to be a war? An actual, nuclear war?"
laurie,Static?
laurie,"Jon, you've got to stop it! Everyone will die!"
laurie,"You're right, Jon--what does human life matter next to a, a neutrino. Look, I'm not going to debate you when you clearly don't see anything terribly miraculous about life. I guess quantum physics doesn't allow for miracles."
laurie,"Oh God, Jon. Land this thing. Now."
laurie,"That's it then. You can send me back to Earth to fry with Dan and my Mom and all the other worthless humans. And look, you were wrong. You said this ended with me in tears and see? Not a damp eye in the house. Maybe you're wrong about everything."
laurie,"I'm not afraid, okay? You want me to see things your way? Go ahead, do that thing you do. She stands there, arms folded, waiting. Then, just like earlier in the lab, Jon touches her head--"
sally,"You wanted to hear it, so I'm telling you, okay?. Magic! Dreams! That's what I had before. I was a hero goddammit!"
laurie's father,It's not my fault you got old! What do you have to complain about?! I'm putting food on the table for you and your child. Why don't you give your friend Eddie a call? Maybe he can give you a better life!
sally,It was a mistake--one time! Am I never-- And then they notice Laurie looking at them.
laurie,Mommy?
sally,"Oh. Oh, Laurie"
laurie,"No. No, no, no, no not him"
laurie,But he--
laurie,"Well, of course you're going to say that."
laurie,What? But you were saying--
laurie,"But if my birth is a miracle you, you could say that about anyone."
dan,"I've got a large reading ahead. Anything that's emitting that much heat out here, must be a pretty big facility. Adrian."
rorschach,The engines--
dan,"They're icing up, hold on! Dan pulls the stick back. The ship SHUDDERS UPWARD."
dan,"We just lost the engines--find something to grab on to! The ship BARELY CLEARS THE CLIFF. BOUNCING hard, it SKIPS across the snow like a stone, finally CRASHING INTO A DRIFT."
dan,The engines are de-icing. You sure I can't fit you with something warmer?
rorschach,Fine like this.
adrian,"See this painting? Alexander the Great. Before his conquest of Phoenicia, he struck North for Gordium, where the world's greatest puzzle waited. A great knot, impossible to untie. For a young man determined to rule the world, it was a challenge he couldn't resist. So he sliced it in two with his sword. Lateral thinking, you see. Suddenly the Lynx stands, GROWLS."
adrian,"Really, getting even this far is an admirable effort, given their limitations. Of course the ice they're skating on is slippery and thinner than it looks. Let's hope they don't overstep themselves. On the monitors, Dan takes a LASER TORCH to the door."
rorschach,"Hitler was a vegetarian. If you're squeamish, leave him to me. We won't get a second chance."
adrian,Mind your manners.
dan,"Adrian, don't make me-- Adrian picks up a GOLDEN SERVING TRAY off the table as Dan FIRES. Adrian DEFLECTS the laser with the tray-- --then DISCUS-SLINGS the tray into Dan's NOSE. Blood SPRAYS, Dan drops to his knees. Adrian turns his back on them, calm."
adrian,Now. What can I do for you?
dan,"You know! You killed the Comedian! You set up Rorschach! You created Pyramid Industries, hired all those people, gave them cancer and blamed it on Jon!"
adrian,Yes.
dan,"Dammit Adrian, what are you trying to do?"
adrian,"What we always intended--to improve the world. As Adrian speaks, Rorschach sneaks up behind him, with a FORK. He tries to stab Adrian in the back, but Adrian effortlessly dodges the blow, GRABS Rorschach's mask, TWISTS it, then KNEES him in the gut. Rorschach drops to the floor. Adrian starts walking out of the hall. Dan helps Rorschach up and they follow."
adrian,"After Blake, I neutralized Jon--a plan nearly a decade in the works after analyzing confidential psychological profiles which predicted his withdrawal from human existence. By then, Rorschach's mask theory, 'though erroneous, needed to be addressed, so I faked my own assassination--"
dan,Why take that risk? What if the hitman shot you first instead of your assistant?
adrian,"I suppose I'd have to be fast enough to catch the bullet then, wouldn't I? Adrian smiles enigmatically."
dan,"Triumph? Adrian, what are you going to do?"
adrian,"I'm firing a beam of concentrated energy, synthesized from Dr. Manhattan himself, into the hearts of nine key regions around the globe, crossing all traditional politics and ideologies;"
dan,Three million people? You're joking.
rorschach,He's not. Listen to his voice.
dan,"Rorschach, he's making it up!"
adrian,"I understand your disbelief, Dan. When I began the plan ten years ago, my moral safeguards gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice. See, the Comedian was correct. What we were doing with the Watchmen was pointless--the savage nature of humankind would inevitably lead to the end of the world. So in order to save the world, I had to trick it--to frighten the world towards salvation with history's greatest practical joke."
dan,By killing millions of people? And when were you planning on doing this?
adrian,"When? Dan, my dear friend, I am the smartest man in the world--do you seriously think I'd explain my master stroke if there remained even the slightest chance of you affecting it's outcome?"
laurie,"God Jon, what was that? Jon looks around the street. Even he is awe-struck."
laurie,Was it a war? It doesn't seem like--
laurie,"Take me out of here, Jon. Please."
laurie,Anywhere. Anywhere's better than here.
dan,"God. God, he"
rorschach,Impersonated Dr. Manhattan. Murdered millions of people.  Call off your cat. Call off your cat and face me!
adrian,"Don't you understand? I've ended the war-- I've ended all wars. Because of their fear of ion, I've forced the world into everlasting peace."
dan,By committing the biggest mass murder in history. You have no right to play God!
adrian,I wasn't playing God. Just Dr. Manhattan. Suddenly there's a LOUD BEEPING in the hall. The Lynx growls. Adrian switches the monitors to the security cameras which show ion and Laurie materialize in the snow.
laurie,"Wait, this is Adrian's compound? Are you saying he's responsible for this-- Jon walks toward the building, entranced. Distracted."
laurie,"What, Daniel? Millions of others? Jon don't start that crap now, not here!"
inside,"In a burst, he's gone."
rorschach,"No, don't let him escape!"
dan,"Jon, stop him, he killed millions of people, who knows what else he'll do. Jon walks calmly after Adrian."
dan,What? Where's Laurie?
inside,Jon follows Adrian into the next room.
adrian,"Forgive me, girl. Jon enters the corridor with the Lynx; Adrian flicks a SWITCH. The Lynx' FUR STANDS ON END as ENERGY CRACKLES BETWEEN THE METAL WALLS. The Lynx HOWLS."
adrian,"You know, I really wasn't sure that would work."
dan,"Laurie, shoot him again! Adrian's hand falls from his chest to the floor, blood trickling, as his PALM OPENS-- --holding a BULLET inside."
laurie,"Oh shit. Adrian opens his eyes and KICKS her in the stomach, sending her flying back."
dan,"LAURIE! If you've hurt her, I'll--"
adrian,"Oh Dan. Grow up. Adrian exits as Dan helps the winded Laurie to her feet. Together, Rorschach, Dan and Laurie follow him back to:"
adrian,"Yes. Yes, you could say that. Adrian goes back to his wall of screens, watching the news reports. We hear SOUND BITES and IMAGES: ""India and Pakistan immediately call for truce,"" ""China stands down,"" ""US withdraws forces,"" ""Israel agrees on cease fire."" TEARS stand in Adrian's eyes. He raises his fists in triumph."
laurie,Next? You can't get away with this!
adrian,"No? Will you expose me, undoing the peace so many have just died for? Morally, you're in checkmate, just like the Comedian was. Jon examines the many screens, taking it all in."
dan,He's right. All we did was fail to stop him from saving Earth.
laurie,We we can't say anything about this
rorschach,"You're joking, of course. Rorschach walks toward the exit."
dan,"Rorschach, wait a second! Let's talk this out!"
rorschach,"Never. Not even in the face of Armageddon. Never compromise. Adrian and Jon's eyes meet--an unspoken communication. Seeing this, Dan runs after Rorschach."
dan,"Rorschach! Across the hall, ion materializes between Rorschach and the exit."
rorschach,Back to the Owl-Ship. Back to America. People must be told. Evil must be punished.
rorschach,"Suddenly you've rediscovered humanity? If you had cared from the start, none of this would be necessary. None of this would have happened. So what are you waiting for? Do it."
laurie,"Leaving? I, I thought you regained an interest in human life."
adrian,"Jon, I'd hoped to talk to you. I've made myself feel every death, see every innocent face I've murdered to save humanity--you understand, don't you?"
understand,"And with that, he disappears. Forever."
adrian,"What's on your mind, Dan?"
dan,Your death.
adrian,Really. You want to kill me?
dan,"Yeah. You might have created peace, but not at the expense of justice. You need to pay for what you've done."
adrian,"That doesn't sound like you, Dan. That sounds more like Rorschach."
dan,Exactly. Adrian readies himself. Laurie breaks away from the TV screens.
adrian,"Only you're not Rorschach, are you now? How do you expect to succeed where he failed?"
dan,"Tell you the truth, Adrian. I don't. Dan FLIES at Adrian, fighting like a madman for his life. His fighting style has changed. Dan's newfound brutality is informed by everything he's learned from Rorschach. About justice. About life. But Adrian is the best. He takes Dan's attacks apart with ease, delivering blows which would kill a man not quite so focused on his goal. In the end, he CATCHES Dan's final strike and TWISTS. Dan's arm SNAPS easily."
laurie,"Dan! Laurie charges Adrian. With one hand, Adrian blocks her attack, grabs her by the hair and SLAMS her to floor, knocking her out."
adrian,"I have to say, I've always thought your choice of an owl was quite juvenile."
dan,"Really? I've always liked owls Adrian sees that Dan has pulled one last item from his belt. Adrian STEPS on Dan's WRIST, bones crunching. Dan's HAND falls OPEN, revealing the OWL-SHIP REMOTE."
adrian,I . don't regret my actions. I know in my heart . I did the right thing.
dan,"So do I. Adrian lays back, calm, accepting and dies."
dan,"That's it. Careful. Now, pull the stick to the left The ship RISES and TURNS awkwardly in the hall, smashing out more glass."
sally,You sure you don't want a drink?
sally,"It, it was years later, he stopped by out of the blue, and, and apologized. I don't know, I just couldn't stay mad. It just happened-- Laurie kisses her mother's teary cheek."
laurie,Mom. People's lives take them strange places. You never did anything wrong by me. Sally jumps as a CLICK/WHIR SOUND comes from a BOOKCASE.
sally,What the hell is that?
laurie,"Oh that's Dan. Home from ""work."" The bookcase SLIDES ASIDE and a blond DAN enters from the secret ELEVATOR. He is trim and confident, cheeks flushed with color. Buttoning up his shirt, he spots Sally."
dan,Oh hi.
sally,"Hello, Dan. Excuse me, I should clean up. Sally wipes her runny make-up, goes to the bathroom. Dan and Laurie embrace, kiss."
laurie,Any bad guys last night?
dan,"There are always bad guys. Even in today's world. Slow, Laurie turns to the window. Looks out at the New York skyline being rebuilt."
laurie,Dan.
dan,Hmm?
laurie,"Will it be alright? The world, I mean. He puts his arm around her shoulder."
dan,"As long as no-one ever finds out that Adrian was behind it all, the public will think ion is still up there, watching."
laurie,Yeah. Just fine
editor,SEYMOUR! What the hell do you got for me?
editor,"We got nothing to write about. Everyone in the country, every country in the world is holding hands now, singing songs about peace and love--it's like we're living in a goddamn global hippie commune !"
seymour,"Um, I guess I can look for stuff in the crank file."
editor,"Crank file? Whatever! Take some initiative! Run whatever you like-- Seymour turns to the PILE of submissions known as the crank file, where RORSCHACH'S JOURNAL sits on top. Seymour reaches--"
