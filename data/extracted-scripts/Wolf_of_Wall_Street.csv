Speaker,Dialogue
jordan,Twenty five grand to the first cocksucker to nail a bullseye!
captain dave,Pull up!   Jesus! We're gonna crash!!
jordan," Ya guzza git hazarous doozy pay, buddy."
jordan,"I take Quaaludes for my back, fifteen to twenty a day. 5. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 JORDAN  I use Xanax to stay focused, ambien to sleep, pot to mellow out, cocaine to wake up and morphine because it's awesome."
jordan,"But of all the drugs under God's blue heaven, there's one that's my absolute favorite."
jordan,"Enough of this shit'll make you invincible, able to conquer the world and eviscerate your enemies."
jerry fogel,You got a problem with that?  Jordan?
jordan,Nope.   No problem at all. 7. The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13
jerry fogel,"Your job is `connector', which means you'll be dialing the phone over 500 times a day, trying to `connect' me with business owners. And till you pass your Series 7, that's all you'll be doing. Sit."
mark hanna,"Jordan? Mark Hanna.  Good, you've met Jerry. One of the smartest guys in the office. Who's ever sucked a dog's cock out of loneliness."
jerry fogel,Smile and dial. And don't pick your fucking head up till one.
mark hanna,"Don't mind Jerry, his father raped him as a child. Besides, I'm senior broker here, he's a worthless piker. I heard you pitched stock at your job interview."
jordan,Had to do something to stand out.
mark hanna,I fuckin' love that! Let's grab lunch later. Windows good with you?
jordan,Great.   Yeah. 8. The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13
mark hanna,Let's fuck!!
mark hanna," Your broker in West Virginia? What are you buying, a coal mine? It's the 80s, the game is high- tech."
jerry fogel,Dial the cocksucking phone!
mark hanna, Got enough for one more? Tootski?
jordan,No.   Thanks though.
hector,"Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you on this glorious afternoon?"
mark hanna,"Here's the game plan, Hector. Bring us two Absolut Martinis straight up. Precisely seven and a half minutes after you deliver those you'll bring two more, then two more every five minutes until one of us passes out."
hector,"An excellent strategy, sir."
jordan,"Actually, I'm good with 7-Up."
mark hanna,"First day on Wall Street, Hector. Give him time.  No thanks, I'm not eating."
jordan,You can get high during the day and still function? 10. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13
mark hanna,"High is the only way to do this fucking job. Guy who coined the term ""three-martini lunch"" was a woman. Cocaine and hookers, my friend, the keys to success."
jordan,"I gotta say, I'm really excited about being part of your team. I wanna do all I can for our clients and --"
mark hanna," ""Here at L.F. Rothschild, our clients aren't just important, they're family."" Just as long as we get our taste first. Remember something, Jordan, your top priority in this job: make us money. If the clients get rich along the way, bully for them. Got a girlfriend?"
jordan,Wife.   She cuts hair.
mark hanna,"OK, first rule of Wall Street. Nobody -- and I don't care if you're Warren Buffet or Jimmy Buffet -- nobody knows if a stock's going up, down or fucking sideways, least of all stock brokers. But we have to pretend we know. Make sure you stay relaxed. Nobody wants to buy something from someone who sounds like they haven't gotten laid in a month. Take breaks when you feel stressed, jerk off if you can. You like jerking off, right?"
jordan,Well... sure.
mark hanna,"Good, jerking off is key. And I highly recommend cocaine, which will make you dial faster, which is good for me. Churn `em and burn `em, baby. 11. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13"
mark hanna,Holy.   Fucking. Shit.
teresa,"So I'll take an extra shift, don't worry about it."
jordan,You work too much as it is.
teresa,We could pawn my engagement ring.
jordan,"We're not pawning anything. I'm gonna be a millionaire, Teresa."
teresa,"You know that doesn't matter, right?"
jordan," ""Nobody Beats the Wiz"".      I could be a stock boy."
teresa,You're a stock broker.
jordan,"No one's hiring brokers right now, sweetie."
teresa,This place is.
jordan,I'm looking for Investor's Center?
dwayne,"That's us, hey. Dwayne."
jordan," Jordan Belfort, I called earlier. I was a broker with Rothschild."
toby welch,"I'm tellin' you, this stock is goin' up!... Cause I know, okay?!... I have inside information!"
jordan,Where are your quotrons?
dwayne,"No quotrons, we sell off the pink sheets -- penny stocks."
jordan,Six cents a share? Who buys this crap?
dwayne,"Schmucks mostly. Mailmen, plumbers, people thinking they can get rich quick. They answer our ads, Popular Mechanics, Hustler. 14. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13"
jordan,The spread on these is huge.
dwayne,"So's your commission, that's the point. Blue chips stocks you get what, one percent? Pink sheets are fifty."
jordan,"Wait a second. You're telling me if I sell two thousand dollars worth of stock, my commission is a thousand bucks?"
dwayne,"Technically, yeah, but not even the biggest schmuck buys two thousand dollars of this shit."
jordan," Mr. Fleming, good morning, Jordan Belfort with Investor's Center in New York City. You recently responded to one of our ads..."
toby welch,How'd you fuckin' do that?
jordan,"It's a rock-solid company, sir, it's the next Microsoft... Six thousand. Terrific."
donnie,That your Jag in the lot?
jordan,Yeah.
donnie,Nice ride.      Donnie Azoff.
jordan,Jordan Belfort.
donnie,"I've seen it around. We live in the same building. Twelfth floor?  What do you do, bro?"
jordan,Stock broker.
donnie,"Kids furniture, me and my brother- in-law. Making any money?"
jordan,Seventy grand last month.
donnie,Get the fuck out. You made seventy grand in one month.
jordan,Seventy two actually.
donnie,"Tell you what. You show me a pay stub with $72,000 on it, I'm quitting my job right now and coming to work with you."
donnie,"Yo Paulie, it's Donnie...     Yeah, listen, I quit."
donnie,"No problem, if we have a kid who's a retard, we'll just leave it on the steps of some institution."
donnie,"You now, take a hit!"
jordan,"Omigod, I fuckin' love you!!"
jordan,"--see everyone wants to get rich, so you're already half way there by the time the call starts."
sea otter,"I sold weed once to this Amish dude, had one of those beards with no mustache?"
robbie feinberg,So?
sea otter,He only wanted to make furniture.
chester ming,What's that got to do with anything?
sea otter,He just said everyone wants to get rich.
robbie feinberg," That's true, you did."
sea otter,"Buddhists too, they don't give a shit about money either."
chester ming,"Man I could sell weed to anybody, get a convent full of nuns fucking wasted."
teresa,Omigod.   Jordan.
jordan,You like it?
teresa,It's beautiful.
jordan,"They're small, I know, but the stones are really high quality."
teresa,"No, no.   I love it."
jordan,Then what?
teresa,"I don't know, it's just -- these stocks, these crappy companies."
jordan,In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate. 21. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13
teresa,Why can't you be legitimate now?
jordan,"It's not illegal, Teresa, technically. I mean they're real stocks, they're just..."
teresa,"Never gonna make anybody money.  Wouldn't you feel better selling this junk to rich people, who can afford to lose the money at least?"
jordan,Rich people don't buy penny stocks.
teresa,Why not?
jordan,"Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton Oakmont.   The clients we've gone after in the past -- they're done. We will now target exclusively the wealthiest one percent of Americans. The methods we've used -- over. Loud, obnoxious sales hype is worthless with these people. 23. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 JORDAN  In military terms it's like carpet- bombing -- noisy, menacing and only marginally effective. As Stratton brokers you will be laser- guided smart-bombs aimed at high- priority targets. You will establish an initial relationship with your clients selling only blue chip stocks -- then and only then will you attempt to sell the pink sheets, where the real money is. Now the key to every sale is this:"
jordan,"--and once Kodak settles the lawsuit, institutions will be permitted to buy their shares in large blocks again. And when that happens, which is any day now, what do you think will happen to the price of Kodak stock?"
jordan,"Exactly. Which is why you should pick up 5000 shares today, a $200,000 investment."
jordan,Then you lower your voice.
jordan,"Believe me, sir, you will not be sorry."
jordan,"Then you wait. Whoever speaks first loses. At this point, where are we in the sale? Chester?"
chester ming,About to close?
jordan,"No, you sweet and sour douchebag! We're at the beginning of the beginning! This is where the sale starts. You as a salesman are almost hoping he says no so you can finally do your fucking job!"
jordan,"He doesn't know, he needs to think, he's gotta ask his wife! The fact is it doesn't matter what the fuck he says! If he's already agreed that the stock's going up, then the only real objection he has at this point is he doesn't trust you! And he shouldn't trust you, you're a fucking salesman! So what do you say? 25. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13"
donnie,"Let me ask you this, sir -- had I been your broker for the past three to four years and made you money on a consistent basis, you probably wouldn't say you need to think about it, you'd probably say pick me up three or four thousand shares, am I right?"
sea otter,Wait a second. You mean to tell me if I put you in Union Carbide at 7 and took you out at 32--
robbie feinberg,If I put you in Texas Instruments at 11 and took you out at 47--
chester ming,"--Walmart at 16 and took you out at 95, you wouldn't say Chester pick me up 10,000 shares? C'mon."
donnie,"So the problem is that I don't have the luxury of a track record. Sir, let me reintroduce myself to you. My name is Donnie Azoff--"
rugrat,--Nicky Koskoff--                                        *
chester ming,Chester Ming--
peter deblasio,Peter DeBlasio from Stratton Oakmont in New York City--
toby welch,--and I plan on being the top broker in my firm this year.
sea otter,"So what about this? We start small with 500 shares, a cash"
kimmie belzer,"If if goes down 10%, will it make you a poor man? No.."
chester ming,What this trade will do is serve as a benchmark for future business.
peter deblasio,The downside is minimal and the upside is a long-term relationship with a broker on Wall Street who will consistently make you money.
jordan,Your only regret will be that I didn't call you six months ago.
jordan,Everybody have a good week?
jordan,"That conniving little twat!  ""The Wolf of Wall Street""."
teresa, Your hair looks good.
jordan,"""Jordan Belfort, a twisted version of Robin Hood who takes from the rich and gives to himself and his merry band of brokers""."
teresa,"There's no such thing as bad publicity, sweetie."
jordan,The hell's all this?
janet,The Forbes article.    They're applying for jobs.
job applicants,Mr. Belfort!    Over here! Sir! 30. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

max," Hello?... Yes, Gene, right-eo. Good-good then... Cheerio."
max, Goddamn fucking halfwit! 33. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13
jordan,What if he gets hurt?
jordan,Get some tranq darts.
donnie,A little straitjacket.                              *
janet,Your dad's coming. With the American Express bill.
jordan,Can you stop him? 36. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13

max,"$430,000 dollars in one month!! Four-hundred-and-thirty-thousand dollars in one month!!"

donnie, Twerp.
max,"You zip it, too, Azoff, those boiling teeth of yours are hurting my fucking eyes!  My own son! From my very loins! What do you think this is?                          *"

jordan,Donnie ordered sides.
donnie,"Yeah, that was... Sorry."
max, What is EJ Entertainment?     What is EJ Entertainment?!
jordan," You tell me, Dad."
max,It's a goddamn prostitution ring is what it is!!
donnie,Doesn't the IRS allow for T&A?
max,"It's T&E and stop fucking with me! What kind of hookers take credit cards, anyway?!"
jordan,"Give us a minute, will you, guys?"
max,What's the matter?
jordan,"Nothing, just... My back's been killing me. Pain shooting down my leg. Not to worry, it'll pass."
max,What do the doctors say?
jordan,"Doctors, what do they know? I'm on like twenty different medications.  Look, I know it's hard for you to make sense of these expenses, but there's a method here, okay?                        * 39. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13"
max,"And you have to lead by example, is that it?  I'm tellin' ya, kid, one of these days... one of these days the chickens are gonna come home to                      * roost."
crowd,Jor-dan!   Jor-dan! Jor-dan!
jordan,Exactly. We do our own IPO's and we will print money.
sea otter,"Eat like a bird, shit like an elephant, baby!"
jordan,They can take their Harvard asses under our desks and suck our cocks.  How soon can you get the paperwork filed?
rugrat, Can't we talk about this Monday?
jordan,It's a simple fucking question. 41. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13
rugrat,Except I'm looking at three of you right now.
donnie," Oh, oh, Steve... Steve..."
jordan,What?
donnie,...Steve... M-m-madden...

rugrat,My nutsack's about to explode.
cristy,"Jordan, hey.  Have you met my friend Naomi?"
jordan,Naomi.
naomi,You have an awesome house. I don't think I've ever been in a house like this. 43. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13
jordan,"You like it? I just got it. I guess it's okay. Six bedrooms, two hot-tubs, one off the master suite overlooking the water. You like to jet-ski?"
blair,Hi.   Blair Hollingsworth.
jordan,You're telling me you've never jet- ski'ed in your life?!
naomi,Never.
blair,"Y'know, we really should hit it, there's two other parties we're s'posed to get to --"
jordan,What?    You just got here.   Stay.
hildy,"Jordan, Teresa needs your help."
jordan,With what?
hildy,"I dunno, you'll have to ask your wife what she wants."
hildy,Donnie!   What the fuck are you doing?!
jordan,Bay Ridge.      That's near Staten Island?
naomi,"Brooklyn, across the Verrazano Bridge. Guinea gulch. Ever been?"
jordan,You're Italian?
naomi,"My dad's side. Also Dutch, German, English -- I'm a mutt. Actually I have family over there, in London. My Aunt Emma."
jordan,That explains it then.
naomi,What?
jordan, You're a Duchess. The Duchess of Bay Ridge.
naomi,Could I have a straw please?
jordan,How come?
naomi,Aren't you married?
jordan,Married people can't have friends?
naomi,So I don't stain my teeth.
naomi,"An entire line of lingerie -- camisoles, bustiers, panties."
jordan,Sounds like something I might invest in. Venture capital. 46. The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13
naomi,"Well we should definitely keep in touch, then."
jordan,Absolutely.
naomi,That's me.
naomi,You wanna come up for some tea?
naomi,"Say hi, Rocky."

teresa,Tell me you don't love her.
jordan,I...
teresa, Jordan?
jordan,"Thank you, Nicholas."

donnie,"I'll knock your fuckin' teeth out, motherfucker!"
jordan,"Just give me the money, give me the jewelry, and we'll forget the whole thing."
jordan,"Nicholas. You could fuck a baby sheep as far as I care, on my brand new fucking sofa. What I won't stand for is being robbed."

donnie,"You're dead, you piece of shit!"
jordan,Fine.

aunt emma,"Into the donuts, I see."

jordan,Careful now.     You ready?
naomi,What is this?
jordan,Your wedding present.       Check out the name.
naomi,"Wake up, you bag of shit!"
jordan,The fuck are you doing?!
naomi,Who's Venice?
jordan,What?!
naomi,Who is she?! Some little hooker you fucked last night?
jordan,What?    No!    Naomi!
naomi,You were calling her name in your sleep!
jordan,I can explain everything.
naomi,Go ahead. More lies from the man who lies for a living!
jordan,"No, really. Donnie and me, we're investing in a condo development in Venice."
naomi,Italy?!
jordan,"California, baby."
naomi,"Yeah, right."
jordan,"Duchess, come on."
naomi,"Don't `Duchess' me, you scumbag. You think I don't know what you're up to? You're a father now and you act like an infant!"
jordan,Fuck. Naomi!    Why are you so mad?
naomi,Where do you want me to start? How about you flying in here on your stupid helicopter at three in the morning waking up Skylar?!
naomi,But why should you give a shit? You're not the one who researched the fucking thing and dealt with the fucking golf course people!
jordan,"You're an aspiring landscape architect?! But what happened to wine connoisseur? Oh wait, that was last month!"
naomi,Fuck you!
jordan,I wasn't flexing my arms. You're just lucky to have a husband who's in such great shape. Now get over here and kiss me!
naomi,Kiss you?!
jordan,Where the fuck were you last night?
jordan,"Hey, Skylar."
naomi, Good morning Daddy. Where's my kiss?
jordan, Does Daddy get to kiss both his girls?
naomi,"Ohhh, no! Daddy doesn't even get to touch Mommy for a very, very long time."
jordan,"C'mon, Nay, please. You know how sorry I am. I swear I--"
naomi," So take a good look. You'll be seeing an awful lot of it around the house, but no touching."
jordan,"C'mon, why are you doing this? I said I'm sorry."
naomi," Ohhhh poor, poor Dada. He loves to say how wrong he is when he's ready to come in his own pants. Isn't that right Dada? Mommy loves Daddy so, so much and there's nothing she wants to do more right now than to make love to Daddy all day long. Well, I guess it's time for Daddy to be taught his first lesson. 63. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages     3/5/13"
jordan,"I wouldn't do that if I were you Mommy. I think Mommy should hear a story before she decides to please herself like that. Can Daddy tell Mommy a story?  Good. Once upon a time there was a great big mansion in Long Island and the people who lived there had lots and lots of money. But of all the possessions they had, there was one thing that was much more valuable than all the rest combined, and that was their little baby daughter."

another broker,Nice fucking hat!
steve madden,"I uh... first started working in the shoe industry, in a shoe store. When I was sixteen, my friends were out chasing girls, but I was learning about women's shoes."
steve madden,No. Heh-heh. Not like that. I mean somehow I became fascinated with the endless design possibilities for women's shoes--
jordan,"All right, let's hear it for Steve Madden and the wonderful Mary Lou!"
jordan,"Of the two million shares being offered for sale, a million belonged to me, held in phony accounts by my ratholes. Once the price hit the high teens, I--"

jordan,But my goddamn wedding video?

bo dietl," Good news is I made some calls, DEA, Justice? No one but him even knows who you are."
jordan,"Can you bug him or something, tap his phone?"
bo dietl,"Jordan, relax. First off, you don't fuck with these guys, not that way. Secondly, I got a P.I. license, you know?"
jordan,"Maybe I should call him, see what he wants."
bo dietl,"No! Anybody does that should be your lawyer. What you do is eat your dinner, drink your drink, and forget about it. Cuz as far as I hear he doesn't have shit."
agent denham,"Mr. Belfort, I'm Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes. 74. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13"
jordan,"Heya! This is Nicole and, um...Heidi. Girls, Patrick and...?"
agent denham,Agents Denham and Hughes. Your message said you wanted to speak privately.
jordan,"It did. I do.  Give us a minute, okay?"
agent denham,Bureau forbids us from drinking at sea.
jordan,"I have something for you, I just gotta find it. Have a seat, will ya? Ever been on one of these before?"
agent denham,A boat? Learned to sail when I was six.
jordan,"I mean, one like this. Just had her extended to put a chopper on the back."
agent denham,Never been on a boat with a second mode of transportation on top of it.
jordan,"Names and addresses of every guest at my wedding. Friends, clients. I even threw in the seating chart. Heard that's why you wanted the video, figured this'd expedite whatever it is you're doing.  I wanted to show you I've got nothing to hide. I know you're investigating Stratton but for the life of me I can't figure out why. Sure, my company is unorthodox; what brokerage isn't? Maybe we're a little louder than most but we don't do anything illegal. Talk to the SEC, they'll tell you, they checked us out up and down."
agent denham,The SEC's actually a civil regulatory agency. We pursue criminal activity.
jordan,That's what I'm saying. You guys take on real crime. Which is why I'm so curious: what do you think we did?
agent denham,I can't discuss ongoing investigations.
jordan,I understand.
agent denham,"Though, to be frank, this case kinda got dumped on my desk. Some higher-up felt your shop needed looking into after all that press, fell on me to do the looking."
jordan,"You know who you should be looking at? Goldman, Lehman Brothers, Merrill. 76. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 JORDAN  What those guys're up to with collateralized debt obligations? This internet stock bullshit? C'mon. If you want, I'll walk you through exactly --"
agent denham,"-- that'd be great. And if there's anything you can give me just to close out your file, get it off my desk--"
jordan,"-- sure, get you back to the real criminals --"
agent denham,-- then we could both profit from this little sit-down.
jordan,You sure you don't want anything to drink? Water for your pal?  Rumor is your started out in finance. Even got your broker's license before you joined the bureau.
agent denham,Who told you that?
jordan," Ever regret it? Giving up the money-crazed, pin-striped life? Ever think where you'd be if you'd stuck with it?"
agent denham,"When I'm riding the subway home, sweating my balls off, in a suit I've worn three days, sure."
jordan,"Whattaya pull in working at the bureau, if you don't mind me asking. 50-60K a year?"
agent denham,"Just about. We get a free handgun out of it, though, that doesn't suck. 77. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13"
jordan,"S'crazy, the world we live in, the jobs with real value, the ones we should appreciate -- firefighters, teachers, FBI agents -- those are the ones we pay the least."
agent denham,Way of the world.
jordan,"That's one thing I like about what I do, the opportunity to make that right. Take this kid we had interning last year. Didn't want to be a broker, wanted to be an environmental scientist or something, he had a student loan debts up to his eyeballs. Anyway, his mom gets sick, all they can afford is third-rate care. Some of us got together, made an investment on his behalf and -- boom -- overnight everything changes, she's seeing the best doctors in the country. Sadly, didn't work out, she passed but still: having the power to do that makes all the other bullshit worth while.  See, it's all about proper guidance, Pat. Knowing someone with the right relationships, who's discreet. I can change a life almost every day."
agent denham,How much that intern make off your deal?
jordan,North of half a million.
agent denham,"Can you say that again, what you told me?  I believe Mr. Belfort just tried to bribe a federal officer. 78. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13"
jordan,What? I was making conversation.
agent denham,"Sounds like that to me, Jordan."
jordan,"...no, no, no..."
agent denham,...sounded like that...
jordan,"...no, to constitute a bribe, don't I have to make an explicit offer of money for services? With an exact dollar figure attached? All I said was ""north"" of half a million. According to the U.S. Criminal Code, that dog won't hunt, Pat.  Heard you were a straight arrow. That you wouldn't bend the rules other agents might. He was right."
agent denham,You did a background check on me?
jordan,"Figured you were looking into me, was only fair. Plus you sail on a yacht fit for a Bond villain, sometimes you gotta act the part."
agent denham,This is why you invited me down to your yacht? With a couple hookers on it --
jordan,-- those are friends --
agent denham,-- to get a sense of the guy who was coming after you?
jordan,Thanks for coming down. Now get off my boat.
agent denham,"You know, most of the Wall Street jackasses I bust, they were born to the life. 79. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13 AGENT DENHAM  You know, this is about the nicest boat I've ever been on. Just think what a hero I'll be in the office when the bureau seizes it."
jordan,"Hey, Denham! I'm gonna eat a claw of lobster now as I get my cock sucked by Heidi down below. You have a super ride home on the subway thinking about that!                          *"
naomi,Switzerland?    What the fuck is in Switzerland?
jordan,"Swiss cheese, Naomi, what do you fucking think?"
jordan, Sweetheart! Look at you!
jordan,"Donnie.   Donnie, wake up."
donnie,Nuuhh?
jordan,"Untie me, shitbag. You think this is funny?"
donnie,"I didn't tie you, the captain did. He almost tasered you."
jordan,Why?
saurel,Jordan Belfort! At last! Nicholas has told me so much.
rugrat,"Jordan, Jean-Jacques Saurel."
jordan,Nice to make your acquaintance. This is some lobby you got.
saurel,"Ah, yes. We gave our designer an unlimited budget and he exceeded it. Come! You must tell me all about your adventure with the stewardess over coffee!"
donnie,"We have a joke in America. ""Heaven is a place where the police are Brits, the chefs are Italian, the car mechanics are German, the prostitutes are French and the bankers are Swiss."" I never got it `til now -- look at those fucking fish! Come here, little guy..."
saurel,"Yes, we have the same joke here. Only sometimes the English are chauffeurs and the chefs are French. The Germans, alas, are always mechanics; no one wants to grant them more authority than that."
jordan,I'm curious about your bank secrecy laws.
saurel,"Excusez-moi, Jordan, Swiss custom requires ten minutes of idle chit- chat before business can be discussed.  Of course, let's get ""down to it."" What would you like to know?"
jordan,Under what circumstances would you be obligated to cooperate with an FBI or U.S. Justice Department investigation?
saurel,Ca depend.
jordan,Ca depend?      Ca depend on what? 84. The Wolf of Wall Street    Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13
saurel,Whether America plans to invade Switzerland in the coming months.
rugrat,Want me to see if tanks are rolling down the Rue de la Croix?
saurel,"The only way the Banque Real de Geneve would cooperate with a foreign legal body is if the crime being pursued also happened to be a crime in Switzerland. But there are very few Swiss laws pertaining to your ""rumored"" improprieties. Which is why Mr. Azoff's joke is most appropriate: from a financial standpoint you are now in heaven, and we welcome you. If the U.S. Justice Department or FBI or SEC or IRS sent us a subpoena, it would become papier-toillette. We would wipe our ass with it."
jordan,Unless it was an investigation into stock fraud -- which is a crime in Switzerland. Then you'd have to cooperate.
saurel," Yes, we would. Assuming the account is under your name. However, if it were in the name of a nominee of yours..."
aunt emma,Jordan?
jordan, Surprise.
aunt emma,So tell me about this plan of yours.
jordan,"I'd like us to go to Switzerland tomorrow so you can open an account. I'll fund it, and I'll pay you really well for your trouble."
aunt emma,Oh my. 86. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages    3/5/13
jordan,Next month maybe you can fly to New York and we can start moving the cash.
aunt emma,"Moving the cash.  I feel like a character in an Ian Fleming novel. It's all quite racy, isn't it?"
jordan,"It is, and it's illegal too. Of course if you ever got in trouble, I'd come forward in two seconds, say I duped you, but even still."
aunt emma,"Risk is what keeps us young, isn't it darling?"
jordan,"I like that attitude. Promise me                      * you'll spend at least ten thousand pounds per month out of the account, okay?"
aunt emma, I wouldn't even know how. I really do have everything I need.
jordan,But I bet you don't have everything you want. How about a bigger apartment so your grandkids can sleep over?
aunt emma,Shall we sit?
jordan,"Sure, that'd be great."
aunt emma,"Sometimes I wonder if you let money get the best of you, dear.  Among other substances. 87. The Wolf of Wall Street     Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13"
jordan,"It's that obvious, huh?"
aunt emma,It's the height of summer and                         * you've got the chills.                                *

aunt emma, Well there are worse things to be addicted to than sex.
jordan, Why did I just tell you that?                         *
aunt emma, Because I'm very easy to talk to.
jordan,"As a matter of fact you are. My                       * job, you know, it's tough. I mean                     * I'm not complaining, it's just the stress.

aunt emma,You're a man with large appetites.
