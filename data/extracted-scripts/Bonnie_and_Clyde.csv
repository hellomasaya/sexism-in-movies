Speaker,Dialogue
bonnie,"Hey, boy!  What you doin' with my mama's car?"
bonnie,Wait there!
bonnie, Ain't you ashamed?  Tryin' to steal an old lady's automobile.
clyde, I been thinkin' about buyin' me one.
bonnie,"Bull.  You ain't got money for dinner, let alone buy no car."
clyde," Now I got enough money for cokes, and since it don't look like you're gonna invite me inside--"
bonnie,You'd steal the dining room table if I did.
clyde," Come to town with me, then.  How'd that be?"
bonnie, Goin' to work anyway.
clyde,"Goin' to work, huh?  What do you do?"
bonnie,None of your business.
clyde, No...A lady mechanic?...No...A maid?--
bonnie, What do you think I am?
clyde, A waitress.
bonnie, What line of work are you in?  When you're not stealin' cars?
clyde," I tell you, I'm lookin' for suitable employment right at the moment."
bonnie,What did you do before?
clyde, I was in State Prison.
bonnie,State Prison? 
clyde,Yeah.
bonnie, Guess some little old lady wasn't so nice.
clyde, It was armed robbery.
bonnie," My, my, the things that turn up in the driveway these days."
clyde,"What do y'all do for a good time around here, listen to the grass grow?"
bonnie,"Guess you had a lot more fun up at State Prison, huh?"
clyde, I chopped two toes off of it.  With an axe.
bonnie, What?  Why?
clyde,"To get off the damn work detail, that's why.  Want to see?"
bonnie, I surely don't intend to stand here and look at your dirty feet in the middle of Main Street.
bonnie,"Boy, did you really do that?"
clyde,Yeah.
bonnie,You must be crazy.
bonnie,What's it like?
clyde,Prison?
bonnie," No, armed robbery."
clyde, It's...I don't know...it isn't like anything.
bonnie," Hah!  I knew you never robbed bo place, you faker."
bonnie," Yeah, well you got one all right, I guess...but you wouldn't have the gumption to use it."
clyde, You just keep your eyes open.
bonnie,"Hey, what's your name, anyway?"
clyde, Clyde Barrow.
bonnie," Hi, I'm Bonnie Parker.  Please to meet you.  EXT. ROAD.  DAY.  VROOM!  The car zooms off down the road, doing 90.  The fast country breakdown music starts up on the sound track, going just as fast as the car.  EXT. CAR.  DAY.  The car, still speeding, further down the road.  We zoom down and look in the rear window.  CLYDE is driving, we see from behind.  BONNIE is all over him, biting his ear, ruffling his hair, running her hands all over him--in short, making passionate love to him while he drives.  The thrill of the robbery and the escape has turned her on sexually.  EXT. CAR.  ANOTHER ANGLE.  DAY.  The camera pulls back and above the car.  The car starts to go crazy in a comical fashion, manifesting to the audience just what is happening to the driver controlling it.  The car swerves all over the road.  The car comes to a sudden halt.  The car starts again.  It swerves this time almost right off the road before it straightens out.  It jumps and jerks.  Another car comes down the road the other way and CLYDE's car swerves so much as to make the other guy drive right off the road into the dirt.  It is almost Mack Sennett stuff, but not quite that much.  INT. CAR.  BONNIE AND CLYDE.  DAY.  BONNIE grabs the wheel and turns it sharply.  EXT. CAR.  DAY.  It hairpins off the road onto a shoulder beneath some trees.  INT. CAR.  BONNIE AND CLYDE.  DAY.  --still settling to a stop.  BONNIE and CLYDE appear to be necking heavily now, punctuated by BONNIE's squeals of passion as she squirms and hops about like a flea, trying to get to CLYDE.  The floor gear-shift is keeping their bodies apart, however.  In exasperation, BONNIE takes the gear shift and shoves it forward out of their way.  She plunges onto CLYDE, burying him from view. "
bonnie, ...You ready?...
clyde," ...Hey, wait..."
bonnie," Aren't you ready?  Well, get ready!"
bonnie," C'mon, honey, c'mon, boy...let's go...let's..."
clyde," I said, cut it out!"
bonnie, Boy...boy...boy...
clyde," Boy, what?"
bonnie,"Your advertising is dandy.  Folks'd just never guess you don't have a thing to sell.  You better take me home, now."
clyde, Wait!
bonnie,Don't touch me!
clyde," If all you want's stud service, then get on back to West Dallas and stay there the rest of your life!"
clyde,"But you're worth more'n that, a lot more, and you know it, and that's why you come along with me.  You could find a lover boy on every corner in town and it doesn't make a damn to them whether you're waiting on tables or picking cotton, so long as you cooperate. But it does make a damn to me!"
bonnie, Why?
clyde,Why?  Because you're different! You're like me and you want different things.
clyde," You and me travelin' together, we could cut clean acrost this state, and Kansas, too, and maybe dip into Oklahoma, and Missouri or whatnot, and catch ourselves highpockets and a highheeled ol' time.  We can be somethin' we could never be alone. I'll show you...when we walk into the Adolphus Hotel in San Antone', you wearin' a silk dress, they'll be waitin' on you and believe me, sugar, they're gonna know your last name."
bonnie,When'd you figure that all out?
clyde,First time I saw you.
bonnie,How come?
clyde, 'Cause you may be the best damn girl in Texas.
bonnie,"Who are you, anyway?"
clyde, I'll tell you about you.
clyde,"Lessee...You were born somewheres around East Texas...got a big old family, right?...You went to school, of course, but you didn't take to it much 'cause you was a lot smarter than everybody else anyway.  So you just quit.  Now...  ...When you were sixteen...no, seventeen, there was a guy who worked in...uh..."
bonnie, Cement plant--
clyde,"Right.  Cement plant.  And you liked him 'cause he thought you was just as nice as you could be.  You almost married that guy, but then...you thought, no, you didn't think you would.  So you got your job in the cafe...  And every morning you wake up and you hate it.  You just hate it. And you get down there and you put on your white uniform--"
bonnie, Pink.
clyde,"And the truck drivers come in to eat greasy burgers and they kid you and you kid them back, but they're stupid and dumb, boys with big tattoos all over 'em, and you don't like it...And they ask you for dates and sometimes you go...but you mostly don't, and all they ever try is to get into your pants whether you want to or not...and you go home and sit in your room and think, when and how will I ever get away from this?...And now you know."
clyde, Change that.  I don't like it.
clyde,"God, you're a knockout."
bonnie,"Hey, that ain't ours."
clyde,Sure it is.
bonnie,But we came in this one.
clyde,Don't mean we have to go home in it.
bonnie,Clyde...
bonnie, Clyde...
clyde,"Hey, lady."
bonnie, Where you been keeping yourself?
clyde,Slept out by the car.
bonnie,Oh...These accommodations ain't particularly deluxe.
clyde,"No...If they're after us, I want the first shot.  Come on, you got some work to do."
bonnie,You're good.
clyde,The best.
bonnie,And modest...
clyde,Come on.  Got you all set up over here.
clyde,Set her spinnin'.
clyde,Again.  Come down slow with it...
clyde,"Ain't you something?  I tell you I'm going to get you a Smith and Wesson, it'll be easier in your hand.  Now try it again once..."
farmer,Heighdo.
farmer, No sir...no sir.  You all go right ahead.
farmer, Used to be my place.  Not any more. Bank took it.
farmer,"Yessir, moved us off.  Now it belongs to them. "
bonnie,"Well, that's a pitiful shame."
farmer," You're damned right, ma'm."
farmer, Me and him put in the years here. Yessir.  So you all go right ahead. We just come by for a last look.
farmer,You all mind?
farmer,"Hey, Davis!  Come on over here."
farmer, Much obliged.
farmer,Otis Harrison.  And this here's Davis.  We worked this place.
clyde, Miss Bonnie Parker.  And I'm Clyde Barrow.
clyde, We rob banks.
clyde,You just stay in the car and watch and be ready.  You just be ready if I need you.
clyde,Scared?
bonnie,No.
clyde,What are you thinkin' about?
bonnie,Nothin'.
bonnie,What are you waitin' for?
clyde, This is a stickup.  Just take it easy and nothin' will happen to you. Gimme the money.
teller, Heighdy.
clyde, Gimme the money!
teller,"What money?  There ain't no money here, mister."
clyde," What do you mean there ain't no money?  This here is a bank, ain't it?"
teller,This was a bank.  We failed three weeks ago.
clyde, What?  What??
clyde, Tell her!  Tell her!
teller," As I was tellin' this gentleman, our bank failed last month and ain't no money in it.  I sure am sorry."
clyde,Keep it running.
clyde,"Give me a loaf of bread, a dozen eggs and a quart of milk."
clyde,This is a stickup.  I'll take all the money in that drawer now.
clyde,Get the hell out of here!
clyde,"Damn him, that big son of a bitch... He tried to kill me... I ain't got eyes in back of my head... I didn't want to hurt him.  It wasn't a real robbery... Some food and a little bit of dough.  I'm not against him. Damn!"
clyde,"What was wrong, anyway?"
clyde,You just blowed it away.
bonnie,"Well...I'm not sure...  Say, them little red things there stickin' up?  Are they gas pumps?"
bonnie,Isn't that interesting?  How does that there gasoline get in my little old car?
bonnie,"My, you're a smart fellow.  You sure know a lot about automobiles, don't you?"
bonnie,"Well, would you know what kind of a car this is?"
bonnie,"No, no."
bonnie,"No, this is a stolen Chevrolet 8- cylinder coupe."
clyde," You a good driver, boy?"
clyde," No, I don't think so.  He's better off here..."
bonnie,"What's your name, boy?"
bonnie,What's the C.W. for?
bonnie,I'm Miss Bonnie Parker and this is Mr. Clyde Barrow.   We... rob... banks. 
clyde," Ain't nothing wrong with that, is there, boy? "
bonnie," No, he ain't the one."
clyde,"Unless, Boy, you think you got enough guts for our line of work?"
bonnie,"Oh, a man with a record!"
clyde," Now look here, I know you got the nerve to short-change old ladies who come in for gas, but what I'm askin' you is have you got what it takes to pull bank jobs with us?"
bonnie,Mr. C.W. Moss?
clyde,Prove it.
bonnie," C.W., what are you doing?  Why do you do that?"
bonnie,"It's just disgusting, that's why."
bonnie,But...but it makes everything sweet!
bonnie,"Clyde, why does he have to stay in the same room as us?"
clyde,Lemme show you about tomorrow.
bonnie,Why?
clyde,Now C.W.'ll be waitin' right outside in the car.  Here is the teller's cage.  Four of them and over here the desks and what have you...
bonnie,"Why, Clyde..."
clyde,Hmmm??
bonnie,In the same room with us?
clyde,"Hell, where else?  Ain't gonna spread out all over the state..."
clyde," Not yet, anyway.  Now, the door to the bank is here now.  You cover me from there."
bonnie, Just that I love you so much.
clyde,You're the best damn girl in Texas.
clyde, The layout for tomorrow up in Mineola.
clyde,"So what?  We take U.S. 85 to Willis Point, don't you know, and cut over on State Highway 28 at Kaufman, keep on goin' till we hit the farm- to-market road that connects to 105 and that's right up by Mineola.  On a Saturday afternoon..."
clyde,Keep it running.
clyde, This is a stickup.
teller,What?
clyde,This is a stickup.
clyde,Let's go!  Let's go!
clyde,Come on!  Get it out!
man,Stop!
clyde,"Boy, you gotta be poor in the head. You...!  Count of you I killed a man.  Murder...you too."
clyde, Dumb ass stupid.
clyde,"Ever do a dumb thing like that again, I'll kill you boy!"
bonnie,Ssshh!  If you boys want to talk why don't you go outside?
bonnie,"What do you think of me, C.W.?"
bonnie, Why'nt you come get it?
bonnie," Whyn't you come get it, C.W.?"
bonnie," All right, I'll bring it myself."
bonnie," You simpleton, what would you do if we just pulled out some night while you was asleep?"
bonnie,"That's right, C.W.  We'll always be around to take care of you."
clyde," Bonnie, I want to talk to you.  Sit down."
clyde," Look, I can't get out, but right now you still can.  You say the word and I'll put you on the bus to go back to your Mother.  'Cause you mean a lot to me, honey, and I ain't going to make you run with me. So if you want, you say the word."
clyde, Why?  We ain't gonna have a minute's peace.
bonnie,"Oh, pshaw."
clyde," Bonnie, we could get killed."
bonnie, Who'd wanna kill a sweet young thing like me?
clyde, I ain't no sweet young thing.
bonnie,"Oh, Clyde, I can't picture you with a halo, and if you went to the other place you'd rob the Devil blind, so he'd kick you right back to me."
buck," ""What a beautiful thought I am thinking Concernin' that great speckled bird, Remember his name is recorded on the pages of God's Holy word..."""
blanche,"All right, now you did foolish things as a young man, honey-love, but you went and paid your debt to society and that was right.  But now you just gettin' back in with the criminal element."
buck,"Criminal element!  This is my brother, darlin'.  Shoot, he ain't no more criminal than you are, Blanche."
blanche,"Well, that ain't what I heard."
buck,"Now word of mouth just don't go, darlin', you gotta have the facts. Shoot.  Why he and me growed up together, slept and worked side by side.  God, what a boy he was!"
blanche,He's a crook.
clyde, Buck!
buck,Clyde!  You son of a bitch!
clyde,How's ma?  How's sister?
buck,"Just fine, just fine.  Send their best to you."
clyde," Hey, you're fillin' out there. Must be that prison food."
buck,Hell no! 
blanche, Howdy-do.
clyde, Howdy-do.  It's real nice to know you.
buck," I'd like you to meet my wife, Blanche."
bonnie, Hello.
blanche, Hello.
clyde,"Everybody, this is C.W. Moss. C.W., my brother Buck and his wife, Blanche."
buck,"Hey, lemme get the Kodak!"
clyde," Hey, C.W., go put your pants on. We're gonna take some pictures."
buck,Y'all hear about the guy who thought Western Union was a cowboy's underwear?
bonnie,Lemme get one of my bride and my brother.
blanche, Buck!  Don't take my picture now. I'm just a mess from driving all day.
buck,"Oh honey, now you look real fine."
blanche, Did you take my picture?  Oh Buck! I declare--
clyde," Hey, Buck, get one of this."
buck," Clyde, you do one of me and my missus."
clyde, Let me take on of Bonnie.
bonnie, Okay.
buck," Hey, brother, let's you and me do a little talkin'."
clyde," Here, C.W., take the girls' picture."
buck," It was you or him, wasn't it?"
clyde,Huh?
buck,"That guy you killed.  You had to, didn't ya?"
clyde," Yeah, he put me in a spot, so I had to.  He didn't have a Chinaman's chance."
buck,But you had to--
clyde,Yeah.  I had to.
buck, Don't say nothin' to Blanche about it.
clyde,"Hey, that time you broke out of jail, she talk you into goin' back?"
buck," Yeah, you hear about that?"
clyde,I won't say nothin' to Bonnie about it.
buck,I appreciate it.
clyde,"Yeah...say, what d'ya think of Bonnie?"
buck,She's a real peach.
buck,"Boy, are we gonna have us a good time!"
clyde, We surely are!
buck,Yessir!  What are we gonna do?
clyde,"Well, how's this--I thought we'd all go to Missouri.  They ain't lookin' for me there.  We'll hole up someplace and have us a regular vacation.  All right?"
buck,"No trouble, now?"
clyde,No trouble.  I ain't lookin' to go back to prison.
buck,"Hey, what's this I hear about you cuttin' up your toes, boy?"
clyde," That ain't but half of it.  I did it so I could get off work detail-- breakin' those damned rocks with a hammer day and night.  Sure enough, next week I got paroled.  I walked out of that god-forsaken jail on crutches."
buck,Shoot--
clyde,Ain't life grand?
buck,"And the doc, he takes him aside, says, ""Son, your old mama just gettin' weak and sickly layin' there.  I want you to persuade her to take a little Brandy, y'know, to pick her spirits up."" ""Why, doc,"" he says, ""you know my mamma is a teetotaler.  She wouldn't touch a drop."" ""Well, I tell you what,"" the doc says, ""why don't you bring her a fresh quart of milk every day from your farm, 'cept you fix it up so half of it's Brandy and don't let on!"" So he does that, doctors it up with Brandy, and his mamma drinks some of it. "
buck,I give him a month's rent in advance.  We're all set.  Let's get inside.
clyde,Pull up and unload the stuff.
buck," Honey-love, I'm taking you into our first home."
blanche,"Oh look, it's so clean, Buck.  And a Frigidaire...not an icebox!"
buck,He give me the grocery number.
buck," Lemme see, eh 4337...Operator... please ma'm, may I have 4337...if you please?"
blanche,Oh...they got linoleum on the counter.  Ain't that clever!
buck,"Hello, Smitty's grocery...I'd like to order a mess of groceries.  Oh yeah...eh 143 Hillsdale Street. Lessee, about 8 pounds of porkchops, 4 pounds of red beans...a can of Chase and Sandborn...uh."
blanche,"Oh, isn't this something, Daddy!"
buck,"Sshh.  Uh...quart of milk...uh 8 bottles of Dr. Pepper and that's it, I guess.  No...no.  Uh...a box of Rice Krispies...Bye now."
buck,"Boy, you ain't never gonna beat me but you keep tryin' now."
blanche,Jest like an ol' man.  Plays checkers all the time and doesn't pay any attention to his poor lonely wife.
buck,"Cut it out now, honey.  I'm gonna teach this boy a lesson he'll never forget."
bonnie," Oh mercy me, oh my stars!"
bonnie," Oh, Daddy!  Yore such a slowpoke!"
clyde, Hush up a little.  They're in the next room.
bonnie," Shoot, there's always somebody in this room, the next room and ever' other kind of room."
clyde,Oof!...now that ain't no nice way to talk about my brother.
bonnie, I ain't talking about your brother.
bonnie,"Honey, do you ever just want to be alone with Me?  I don't just mean like that...I mean do you ever have the notion of us bein' out together and alone, like at some fancy ball, or, I don't know, where we walk in all dressed and they announce us and it's fancy and in public, but we're alone somehow.  We're separate from everybody else, and they know it."
clyde,I always feel like we're separate from everybody else.
bonnie," Do you, baby?"
bonnie, Quiet!  I'll get it.
bonnie,Who is it?
voice,"Groceries, M'am."
bonnie,How much?
young man,Six dollars and forty-three cents.
young man,"Here, M'am, them bags is heavy. Let me carry 'em up for you."
bonnie," No thanks, I'll take 'em."
buck's voice,What was it?
clyde's voice,Quiet.  Open the door.
bonnie,"C'mon, c'mon..."
bonnie," ""We each of us have a good alibi For being down here in the 'joint'; But few of them really are justified If you get right down to the point. You've heard of a woman's glory Being spent on a downright cur'."""
bonnie,You want to hear this or not?
bonnie,"""Still you can't always judge the story As true, being told by her. Now 'Sal' was a gal of rare beauty, Though her features were coarse and tough--"""
buck,"Yeah, I knew her.  She was cockeyed and had a hare-lip and no teeth!"
bonnie,"""Now 'Sal' was a gal of rare beauty, Though her features were coarse and tough; She never once faltered from duty To play on the 'up and up'."""
bonnie," ""Sal told me this tale on the evening Before she was turned out free, And I'll do my best to relate it Just as she told it to me--"""
clyde, It's the law.
bonnie,"Dammit, you almost got us killed!"
blanche, What did I do wrong?  I s'pose you'd be happier if I got shot.
bonnie," Yeah, it would of saved us all a lot of trouble."
blanche,"Buck, don't let that woman talk to me like that!"
buck, It was a dumb thing to do.
blanche," Please, Buck, I didn't marry you to see you shot up!  Please, let's go! Let's get out of here and leave. Make him stop the car and let us out!"
buck, Can't.  I killed a man.  We're in this now.
blanche, Please!  Please!
bonnie," Shut up!  Just shut up your big mouth!  At least do that, will ya, just shut up."
clyde,"Cut it out, Bonnie."
bonnie, Stop the car.  I want to talk to you.
clyde, What is it?
bonnie,Get rid of her.
clyde,Can't do that.  She's Buck's wife.
bonnie, Get rid of both of them then.
clyde,Why?  What's the matter with you anyway?
bonnie,"She's what's the matter with me, a damn stupid back country hick without a brain in her head.  She ain't nothin' but prunes and proverbs."
clyde, What makes you any better?  What makes you so damn special?  You're just a West Dallas waitress who spent half your time pickin' up truck drivers!
bonnie, Only special thing about you is your peculiar ideas about lovemakin'--which is no love makin' at all.
clyde,"Look, Bonnie--"
bonnie,"Clyde...honey...I didn't mean all that, honey.  Blame it on all that shootin', I just felt so bad...sure enough...Clyde?"
clyde,"Okay...Okay, hon...let's get movin'..."
buck," Hey, y'all, listen to this here: Law enforcement officers throughout the Southwest are frankly amazed at the way in which will-of-the-wisp bandit Clyde Barrow and his yellow- haired companion, Bonnie Parker, continue to elude their would-be captors.  Since engaging the police in a gun battle on the streets of Joplin Missouri and slaying three of their number..."
blanche,"Oh, Lord..."
buck,"...the Barrow gang has been reported as far West as White City, New Mexico, and as far north as Chicago. They have been credited with robbing the Mesquite Bank in the aforementioned White City, the J.J. Landry Oil Refinery in Arp, Texas, the Sanger City National Bank in Denton, Texas on three different occasions.  In addition to these robberies, the fast travelling Barrows have been rumored to have had a hand in the robbing of two Piggly Wiggly stores in Texas, and one A&P store in Missouri, though Chief Percy Hammond, who first identified Clyde Barrow's brother, Buck, as a member of the gang, expressed some doubt that these last robberies were committed by the Barrow Gang alone."
bonnie,Go on.
buck," Hey now, here's something!  Listen here: Lone Cop Arrests Two Officers In Hunt For Barrow.  Police Officer Howard Anderson's heart turned faster than his motorcycle when he forced to the side of the road a roaring black V-8 sedan in which were three men and a blondheaded woman yesterday afternoon."
buck,"When he saw several machine guns in the car he was certain he'd caught Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker, and maybe Buck Barrow and the third unidentified member of the gang. It took a lot of telephoning and explaining to convince the motorcycle cop that his captives were two highway patrolmen and a blonde-haired stenographer from the Highway Patrol--.  Haw!  Haw! "
buck,"Anderson was held up as an example for every other Texas peace officer today. ""That was a mighty brave thing,"" explained Highway Patrol Chief L.C. Winston."
clyde,Sheriff!
buck,"Sweet Jesus, I never seen shootin' like that!"
clyde," Well, now, getta load of this.  I want y'all to know we are in the custody of Cap'n Frank Bryce, and Frank here is a Texas Ranger."
buck,"Say there, peacemaker.  I believe you got your spurs all tangled up. You're in Missouri, you know that?"
clyde,You didn't know you was in Missouri?
clyde, Didn't you?
clyde,"--Now you ain't hardly doin' your job, Texas Ranger.  You oughta be home lookin' after the rights of poor folks, not out chasin' after us."
buck," Easy there, Clyde.  Why take is so personal."
clyde," Reg'lar laws is one thing.  But this here bounty hunting, we got to discourage that."
buck,"Like how, Clyde?--"
bonnie, --uh-uh.  Take his picture.
bonnie, --and all bein' just as friendly as pie.
buck," ...yeah, yeah..."
bonnie," --why we 'bout the friendliest folks in the world.  Texas Ranger waves his big ol' gun at us, and we just welcome him like he's one of our own."
clyde," Buck, get the Kodak!"
buck, Hot dog!
clyde, We're mighty proud to have a Texas Ranger in the family.
buck,"...keep him set on the hood, there...more to the sun, like that...yeah...when all his ranger friends see this...I bet he's gonna wish he was dead!"
clyde," --don't make sense, do it?"
buck,"C'mon, now, Clyde, you and Bonnie first.  Move into him, right close, right friendly."
clyde,"All righty  Don't move, now, hear?"
bonnie,"How's this? ""Captain Bryce and new found friend."""
clyde,"...yeah, yeah...quick, Buck, get it..."
buck,"...I'm gettin' it, I'm gettin' it."
buck, I got the picture.  I got the picture...
clyde," Lemme be, lemme be..."
buck, I got the PICTURE!
clyde,"...All right, all right...  WE GOT YOU...HEAR?... REMEMBER... YOU... YOUR FACE...WE GOT IT...WE GOT YOU...WE GOT YOU...WE GOT YOU..."
clyde,This is the Barrow gang.  Everybody just take it easy and nobody will get hurt.
buck,Don't do nothin' silly now.
clyde,That your money or the bank's?
farmer,Mine.
clyde,"Keep it, then."
clyde, Next time I'll aim a little lower.
buck,Get a good look at us!  We're the Barrow boys.
buck,Happy birthday.
buck," Kick it in the pants, C.W."
clyde,We got to make that state line!
bank guard," Then he saw me goin' for my gun. Clyde Barrow himself, I mean.  And suddenly I was starin' into the face of death!"
woman teller,"Tsk, tsk."
photographer,"Just look this way, Mr. Hawkins."
first policeman,"Step on it, Randolph.  We gotta catch 'em 'fore they reach the state line!"
farmer,"Clyde?...he looked like, well he looked real...clean...and Bonnie, she's too much a lady ever to be caught with a cigar in her mouth...I don't care what you heard before. I saw 'em right here, not twenty minutes ago...  --and all's I can say is, they did right by me, and I'm bringin' me a mess of flowers to their funeral."
clyde,"Okay, relax.  We're in Oklahoma now. Slow down."
first policeman,Turn around.  Don't waste no more gas.
second policeman, Ain't we gone to catch 'em?
first policeman,"Hell, they're over the State line. That's out of our jurisdiction."
second policeman,Why don't we get 'em anyway?
first policeman,I ain't gone to risk my life in Oklahoma.  That's their problem.
clyde," Hell.  That ain't much, is it?"
buck," Times is hard,"
clyde,"Well, let's get to it."
clyde,"This is Clyde Barrow.  Clyde, Buck...Bonnie...C.W. Clyde, Clyde again...Buck...Bonnie...C.W."
clyde,Bonnie...C.S....Clyde...
buck, Um...eh...Clyde?
clyde,Hah?
buck,"Uh, Clyde...well...what about Blanche?"
bonnie, WHAT?
blanche,"Well, why not?  Say I earned my share!  Same as everybody.  I coulda got killed same as everybody, and I'm wanted by the law same as everybody.  Besides I coulda got snake bit sleepin' in them woods every night!  I'm just a nervous wreck and that's the truth.  And I have to listen to sass from Miss Bonnie Parker all the time.  I deserve mine!"
clyde," Okay...okay...hold your horses, Blanche.  You'll get your share."
buck,Married a preacher's daughter and she still thinks she's takin' the collection.
buck," Well, don't spend it all in one place now, hear?"
bonnie,She'll be doin' right well to spend it at all.
clyde,Bonnie?
clyde," Look, Bonnie, I've said it and I guess I'll keep sayin' it before we're thru--Blanche is Buck's wife and Buck is family."
bonnie, --she's such a silly-Billy...
bonnie,My family could use some of that money.
clyde,"Them laws have been hangin' round your mamas house 'til all hours, Bonnie.  It's just too risky to go there."
bonnie," Well, where can we go?  We rob the damn banks, what else do we do?"
clyde," I hear you, C.W."
woman,"Oh, now...now, dear..."
man,Mmmm...sweet thing...
woman,"Say, isn't that your car, Eugene?"
man, That's my car!  Hey!
eugene,"I'll tear 'em apart!  Those punks! Steal a man's car right out from under him!  Wait till I get my hands on those kids, Velma, I'll show 'em!"
velma,"What if they have guns, Eugene?"
eugene, We'd better get the police and let them handle this.
velma,Right.
eugene,Turn around and let's get back to town.  We'll go get the sheriff.
buck,They stopped chasin' us.  They turned around.
clyde,Let's take 'em.
velma,"Oh, my Lord, they're comin' after us."
eugene," Step on it, Velma, step on it!"
clyde,"C'mon, get out!  Get out of there, I said."
clyde, Get in here.
buck,What's your name?
eugene, I'm Eugene Grizzard.
velma,I'm Velma Davis.
buck," Well, howdy!  We're the Barrow gang. That there is Clyde drivin' and I'm Buck."
bonnie,"Look, don't be scared, folks.  It ain't like you was the law.  You're just folks like us."
eugene," Yeah, yeah, that's the truth."
clyde,I expect you been readin' about us.
eugene,Yes.
velma,No.
eugene," Yes, Velma, we have too."
bonnie," Well, you two must be in love, I bet."
buck," Well, when you gonna marry the girl, boy?"
bonnie,"So then she drinks her milk down again, every drop.  And she looks over at her son and says, ""Son, whatever you do, don't sell that cow!"""
bonnie," How old are you, honey?"
velma,Thirty-three.
velma,"Now I ordered some French fries, didn't I?"
buck," Yeah, here you go."
clyde,"Take it easy on those French fries, Velma.  Ain't that right, Eugene?"
eugene, This isn't mine.  I ordered mine well done.  Who's got the other hamburger?
eugene,"That's okay, forget it."
buck, Haw!  I sure am havin' a good time! How 'bout you folks?  Ain't you glad we picked you up?
clyde," Hey, maybe y'all ought to join up with us."
eugene, Ha!  Wouldn't they be surprised back home to hear that?
velma,Yeah.  What would Martha and Bill say if they heard that? 
eugene,Lordy!  They'd throw a fit! 
bonnie," What do you do, anyway?"
eugene, I'm an undertaker.
bonnie, Get them out of here.
clyde," ...see anythin', Buck?"
buck,"--not yet, boy."
clyde, ...C.W....?
clyde," ...Well, where do you think she could've gone?...Buck?...Buck?"
buck," Jesus, I don't know..."
clyde,There!  There!  There!
bonnie,Leave me alone!  Leave me alone!
clyde," ...Hey, hey now...just where did you think you were goin'?..."
clyde, --Huh.  Bonnie?  Where?  Where?
bonnie,"I don't know!  You're hurting me, I was just scared is all...and my mama's been on my mind, and she's gettin' so old..."
clyde,"Boy, don't ever leave without sayin' somethin'.  You really scared me, Bonnie."
bonnie,"But I mean it, though.  I want to see my mama.  Please, Clyde."
clyde," Okay, sweetheart."
sister,"Here you are, we been cuttin' and pastin' everything we could find about you in the papers."
buck,"Hey look, here's that one I took of you, Clyde.  That came out just fine!"
buck," Oh, Horsey! keep your tail up, keep yer tail up, keep yer tail up, Oh, Horsey! keep yer tail up, Why don't you make it rise."
bonnie's uncle, Where y'all headed from here?
clyde," I don't know, what y'all got in mind?  At this point we ain't headin' to anywhere, we're just runnin' from."
bonnie,"Don't go yet, Mama."
uncle's voice," C'mere, c'mere you little corn roller."
mother,"...you know, Clyde, I read about y'all in the papers and I'm jes' scared."
bonnie," Sugar, make mama stay a while yet."
clyde," Now Mrs. Parker, don't y'all believe what you read in the papers! That's the law talking there.  They want us to look big so's they'll look big when they catch us."
clyde,"--and they can't do that.  Why, I'm even better at runnin' than robbin' banks--aw shoot, if we done half the stuff they said we did, we'd be millionaires, wouldn't we, old sugar. "
mother,"...Maybe you know the way with her, then.  I'm just an old woman and I don't know nothin..."
clyde,"We'll be quittin' this just as soon as the hard times is over, Mother Parker, I can tell you that.  Why me and Bonnie were just talkin' the other day and we talked about when we'd settle down and get us a home, and Bonnie said, ""I couldn't bear to live morn'n three miles from my precious mother."" Now how'd you like that, Mother Parker?"
mother,"Don't believe I would.  I surely don't.  Bye, baby."
buck,How long have ya had it?
buck," Touch it, honey!  Go on!"
blanche," Oh, no, Daddy!  No!"
bonnie,What are you all doin'?
bonnie,"Well, why don't you all go play with it somewhere else?"
blanche,What's bothering her?
clyde," Not now, Blanche."
buck," What's bothering her, Clyde?"
bonnie, I said go somewhere else!
clyde," Bonnie's hungry, C.W. I saw a chicken place a few miles back. Who all wants to go get some food?"
blanche, I sure do.  I'm plenty tired of sittin' around here anyway.
buck," You can't drive, honeylove."
clyde,"Just five chicken dinners, and get somethin' for dessert."
buck,See if they got peach ice cream. 
bonnie,I hate you all.
clyde,"I hate y'all, too."
bonnie,"no, I really hate you."
bonnie," Oh, baby, I've got the blues so bad..."
clyde,"Bonnie?...is it your mama, what your mama said?"
bonnie,What mama?...she's just an old woman now...I have no mama...
bonnie," ...so funny...I thought when we first went out, we were really goin' somewhere...but this is it-- we're just goin', huh?"
clyde,Do you care about where we're goin'?
bonnie,Not as long as you care about me.
clyde," Why I love you, sugar."
bonnie's voice,"--enough to die with me, baby?... 'cause I think that's where we're goin'...I surely do."
clyde,--wherever.
blanche, So what?
blanche,"Oh, God..."
blanche," Oh, if I could!  If I could just do that one thing!  Oh, there's no tellin' why this all happened.  I was a preacher's daughter."
blanche," Baptist...oh, and he thought the world of Buck, my daddy did, even knowing that Buck was serving time in jail.  He forgave him for that 'cause he paid his debt to society."
blanche,"Hey, C.W., I ain't got my money. Give me some, will you?"
deputy, Get Sheriff Smoot on the phone.
bonnie's voice,Ready?
clyde's voice, Aw Bonnie--
bonnie's voice, C'mon!
bonnie,"Lie down now, honey."
clyde,I've done enough!
bonnie, You have to lie down...it's the only way we can tell what we'll look kike together.
clyde, Whatta you think?
bonnie, That's not the right tie!
clyde,What?
bonnie, You can't wear polka-dots on an occasion like this.
clyde,Well what--
bonnie,Stripes.  Don't go away now.
bonnie,Perfect.
clyde,"OK, o.k.  If we're gonna do this, at least I can tie it myself.  Lie down before you fall down."
clyde, Better?
bonnie,Much.
bonnie,"All right, shut your eyes now."
clyde," No, you first."
bonnie,One for the money.
clyde,Two for the show.
bonnie,Three to get ready--
blanche, The men are on the other side.
blanche,"Oh, God, please help us!  Dear Father in Heaven, get us out of this and Buck will never do another bad thing in his life! "
blanche,My eyes!  ...light hurts so bad...
blanche," Please, please get us to a doctor! Tell Clyde to get us to a doctor. We'll die here."
bonnie," --here, hon'."
blanche," Clyde, Clyde, please get us to a doctor."
blanche,He's your brother!
bonnie," Buck can't be moved, now, hon'."
buck, Clyde?...Clyde?...
clyde,"Right here, boy."
buck,I believe I lost my shoes...maybe the dog hid 'em... 
man,Surrender!
blanche,Don't kill him!  Don't kill him! He's dying!
blanche,"Don't die, Daddy.  Don't die!"
clyde, Saw...saw a farm...up ahead...gotta get...a car...
bonnie,"Baby, no..."
bonnie,Shhh!
bonnie," Oh, no."
bonnie, I can't die without Clyde.  I just can't.
clyde,"Head out, C.W."
man,"Who are you, boy?"
man, It's Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow.
boy,"Who was they, Pa?"
man,"That was Bonnie and Clyde, the bank robbers."
malcolm,Who's there?
malcolm,Who's there?  Who is it?
malcolm,Clarence!
malcolm,"God, it's good to see you, boy!"
malcolm,What's that on your chest?
malcolm,"Jesus, what happened to them?  You in trouble, son?"
malcolm,Why'd you get yourself marked up? A tattoo!  What in hell made you do a damn fool thing like that?
billy,"I was in the bunch that took 'er. See here?  Can you make me out? Here I am, see here, right behind Joe Boyd here."
pete,"Sure enough, Billy, is that your head there?"
billy,Still can't figure how we let them other two get away.
pete," Yeah, seems as how nobody can get 'em somehow."
billy," Yeah...well, maybe this boy'll be the one to do it, this Hamer guy. Boy if he can't do it, Sheriff, ain't nobody but the whole U.S. Army can do it."
pete, You hear he quit the Rangers on account of Texas got that woman governor.  Said he wouldn't work under no woman.
billy," Yeah, that's somethin' all right. Say, how many they say he shot anyway in his day?"
pete,Sixty-five they say.
billy,Son of a sea-cook!
hamer," Excuse me, am I in the right place? Is this Sheriff Smoot?"
hamer,Hamer. 
clyde," He was shot in too many pieces to pick off the ground!  Fled...what do they know, the papers or the police?..."
clyde,"Why, while we were all lyin' around here, near dead, they had us holdin' up the Grand Prairie National Bank!  They hung that one on us just for luck, I guess."
clyde,"Tell you what.  Soon's we get well, we're gonna take that bank!"
clyde," They don't know nothin'--do they, sugar?"
bonnie," You did all you could, hon'. Nobody coulda done more."
clyde," You can just thank your lucky stars that's all you are.  So long's they don't have your last name, you're home safe."
malcolm," Mr. Barrow's lookin' out for your interests, boy."
malcolm, Ain't that somethin' for me?
clyde," Well now, you been real nice to us, and I tell you what, let us pay you forty dollars for your hospitality, what do you say?"
malcolm," No, no, no.  I don't want your money.  I'm just pleased to have your company.  Any friend of my boy's..."
malcolm," You're welcome here, now you know that."
malcolm," You look like trash, boy, marked up like that.  Cheap trash."
malcolm,"Bonnie, what does she know.  She's just cheap trash herself.  Look what they do to you, and you don't even get your name in the paper-- just pictures put on your skin, by ""Bonnie and Clyde""--  --why they're a coupla kids."
malcolm,I'm just glad your ma ain't alive to see that thing.

clyde, You sure don't resemble that no more.
clyde,What you writin' this time?
bonnie, I'm writing a poem about us.  I'm writing our story.
clyde," Oh, are you?  Let's hear it.  If it's good, I'll mail it in to the Law and it'll be printed in all the papers again."
bonnie,Just let me finish this line.
bonnie," Okay, here it is."

malcolm," Boy, they expect you to go downtown with 'em tomorrow?"
malcolm, Bonnie and Clyde.
malcolm,"...better go then, you better go, better go...  --but when they get back in the car to come on home, don't get in with them."

malcolm, Mebbe.  Just you be off'n the streets of that town when they go to get in their car.
clyde," Bonnie?  Bonnie, will you marry me?"
bonnie,"How could I do that, Clyde?  You know it's impossible.  We'd have to go to a Justice of the Peace and the Justice of the Peace is a lawman.  We couldn't even take out a license."
clyde," Hey now, you sound like you been givin' it some thought on your own."
clyde," Bonnie...are you crying, honey?"

bonnie," Clyde...what would you do, what would you do it some miracle happened and we could walk out tomorrow morning and start all over again, clean, with no record, with nobody after us?"
clyde,"Well...I guess I'd do it all different.  First off, I wouldn't live in the same state where we pull our jobs.  We'd live in one state and stay clean there, and when we wanted to take a bank, we'd go to another state...and..."
clyde, Bonnie?
clyde,"Hey, Bonnie?"
clyde, What happened to C.W.?
bonnie,He stopped off in that hardware store to get light bulbs for his daddy.

bonnie," Isn't that the prettiest thing, hon? Just look here, you can see every little fingernail on her hands."
clyde,"It is a pretty thing, honey."
bonnie,We got any peaches?  I sure could go for a peach right now.
clyde, Whyn't we do it tomorrow?
bonnie,Do what?
clyde,"Tomorrow's Sunday, ain't it?  We could drive all night and be on that golf course tomorrow morning!"
bonnie,You sure you feel up to it?
clyde, Where is that boy?  He's gone too long.
