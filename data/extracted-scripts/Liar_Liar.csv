max,My mom's a teacher. As Max starts to sit:
max,Well... he wears a suit and goes to court and talks to the judge and--
fletcher,"A dark street. . . a stormy night... two desperate men struggle... one man is taken to the hospital, the other to ja il. The prosecutor wants you to believe this is an open-and-shut case of a poor man, brutally victimized. He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70's."
impressive,"moment, then answers his own"
lawyer,"How's it going, Fletcher?"
fletcher, Another gratifying day serving Justice. Fletcher's huge client catches up to him.
client,"Hey great job, Mr. Reid. I wish there was some way I could show my appreciation."
fletcher,"Stay out of my neighborhood after dark. A PUBLICIST carrying, a clipboard approaches Fletcher."
publicist,"Mr. Reid, do you have a moment-?"
fletcher,"No, I'm late picking up my son."
publicist,-Because a couple of reporters want to interview you about your big win today. Fletcher instantly shifts directions.
max,What time is it?
audrey,(checks her

max,"That's no lady, that's mom!"
fletcher,Mom? ! (under his
fletcher,"You know, you were much easier when we were married...  So where are you off too?"
audrey,Stanford. I'm delivering a paper.
fletcher,"O h really? Where I live, we use a boy on a bike."
max,"Hey mom, dad's taking me to see wrestling!"
audrey,Do you have to take him to tho se things? They're so violent.
jerry,"Max, my man! Jerry gives Max ""five"", then kisses Audrey on the lips."
jerry,"Fletcher, good to see you?"
fletcher,What? No kiss for me?
jerry," What do you say, Max? Give me a hand? Fletcher grits his teeth as Jerry gives Max a piggyback ride to get the luggage."
fletcher, I didn't know the boyfriend was going.
audrey,"Jerry. His name is Jerry and yes, he's going. Audrey heads inside."
fletcher,T o Stanford? Overnight? Does this mean you two are... 
audrey,"I've been seeing him seven months, what do you think?"
fletgher,"I was hoping that after being married to me, you'd have no more strength left."
audrey,". Well you have to remember when we were married, I wasn't having sex nearly as often as you were."
fletcher,MEDIC!! I've been hit.
fletcher,"Well, great... I'm so happy for you two. I am just Mister H appy man. Happy, happy, happy."
audrey,"Relax, Fletcher. It looks like Jerry's taking that job offer in Boston. Fletcher turns sincere."
fletcher,"Aud, I am so sorry..."
jerry,(calling to
fletcher," Yo u gonna be okay? Because if not, we could leave Max with your sister and I could go out with you two, does that appeal to you at all? They drive off."
fletcher,"Wave to the soon-to-be ex- boyfriend, Max. (flipping Max the"
max,"Dad, are we really going to go to wrestling?"
fletcher,"Absolutely, Maxattacker. We just have to stop by the office for one minute. Max SIGHS. He's heard this before."

fletcher, 'Fraid not. Sorry.  INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - AFTERNOON
philip,Fletcher!
fletcher,Philip!
philip,And this must be Max!
fletcher," . Yes. Yes it is. Well, it was good seeing you-- Fletcher starts off with Max, when Philip calls after him."
philip,"You know, Ethel and I had a blast at our last little get- together."
fletcher,"Oh, me too. I can never get enough of charades. We'll have to do it again sometime. Fletcher heads into an open elevator... only to find the door's closing impededby Philip's foot."
philip,When?
fletcher,Soon. The door again begins to close... when Philip stops it.
philip,How 'bout tonight?
fletcher,Not that soon. I'm taking Max to see wrestling--
philip,We love wrestling.     We could--
fletcher,"I don't think so. See, Max is really shy around strangers. Max looks up at Fletcher.    He isn't."
philip,Great! Philip hands him his card just as the door closes.
jane,"Hi, Mr. Reid. (indicates, her"
fletcher,Fabulous! I love it. (indicates the
jane,I don't know who sent it. But it's for Mr. Allan. It's his anniversary.
fletcher,Ah... The Partnership Committee meeting still scheduled for Friday?
jane," Yep... Fletcher quickly removes a gift card from his pocket, scribbles on it, puts it in place of the one already there"
max,What are you doing?
fletcher,"Oh, I'm... fixing the card,  Look, they spelled Mr. Allan's name wrong. Have an apple."
fred,I can't do it.
m iranda,"Fred, it's your duty to present the strongest case possible."
fred,"The strongest case possible, consistent with the truth."
miranda,Let the Judge decide what's true. That's what he gets paid for. You get paid to win.
fred,"If you insist on my taking it to trial, I'll represent Mrs. Cole aggressively and ethically. But, Miranda -- I won't lie. Miranda looks out her window, calculating."
miranda,Then we'll just have to find someone who'will.
fletcher,"Hey, Pete! Great tie!        . Max looks at PETE, -whose fashion-disaster tie startles him."
fletcher,Thomas--looks like you're losin' weight. THOMAS glances up from a file. Max notes that he's corpulent.
thomas,Gained three pounds.
fletcher,(wedging past
gre ta,"I'm sure your dad'11 give you something wonderful. Fletcher tries to wave her off, awkwardly stopping when Max turns to him.     ."
max,Yeah?
fletcher,"Oh, yeah. You're going to love it. Uh, why don't you play in my office for a minute? Fax something, sue someone, have a good time. We'll be leaving in a second."
greta,"Oh, there's a surprise. Greta produces a wrapped GIFT."
fletcher,You're a saint. I should get you something.
greta,"You did. She holds up another, smaller package."
fletcher,"Ah. Well, I always do the classy thing. Any calls?"
greta,. Let's see.. .
fletcher,Tell him it's in the mail.
greta,(jotting down a
fletcher,"Write him a long, explanatory letter. Then bill him for the letter."
greta,.    .. Done. Your mother called.
fletcher,I ' m on vacation.
greta,This is your fifth week.      .      .
fletcher,It's a long vacation.
greta,(jotting down a
fletcher, As if I don't have anything better to do than bow and scrape at her royal perfumed p artner feet. Tell her I'm in court.
greta,Court's closed.
fletcher,Tell her I broke my leg and had to be shot.
fletcher,--And then send out a notice of judgement on my win today!
fletcher,"Miranda! I didn't see you. Hey, you look lovely, today. Here, I bought you a gift."
miranda,Thanks. I heard about your victory today. You're making quite an impression on the partnership committee.
max,"We're not going, are we?"
fletcher,Of course we are. A promise i s a promise. We are gonna see wrestling or my name isn't Fletcher T. Reid.
fletcher, Could you hand me that? (the wrestler
audrey,Are you alright?
jerry,"Uh, yeah, just, uh... how long are you gonna be on the phone?"
audrey,"I just wanted to say good- night to Max, but he must still be out with Fletcher, "
audrey,Uh...would I . . . ? What did you say?
fletcher,Max Factor... Happy birthday. How old are you today? T h ir t y ? Forty?
max,Five.
fletcher,"Well, you've held up well. I only wish there was some way to commemorate such an occasion, some small symbol to mark this day, like.... Fletcher produces --"
fletcher,. . . A present! .
max,What is it?
fletcher," a surprise. Max knows his father doesn't have a clue but he rips the box open, revealing, a BASEBALL, GLOVE, DODGER'S CAP, and"
max,Baseball stuff!
fletcher,Baseball stuff.
max, Will you play catch with me?
fletcher,"Tonight. After your party, you have my word on it. Max nods sadly as Fletcher turns back to his work."
audr ey," Jerry, these are for tomorrow."
jerry,The company wants me to get started right away.
audrey,I can't just pick up and move to Boston with two days notice.
jerry,"Ju st come check it out. You a nd Max, see the town. Let's . pick out a place together. Then, if you want to turn me down and scar me for life, fine."
audrey,It's just not that simple... What about my job? I've been at UCLA three years.
jerry,It's New England. They're lousy with colleges. You can't swing a bat back there without hitting a college.
audrey,There are other factors involved.
audrey,Did you have fun? How were the wrestling matches?
fletcher,"Big fun. Manly fun. Am I right, Maxie?"
fletcher, So how were the wrestling matches ? Did you have fun?
jerry,"Max , my man! My happy birthday man! Max and Jerry exchange ""fives"" and'a hug.   Jerry gives Max a light punch on the arm."
jerry,One-two-three-four-five... and one for good luck.
fletcher,Did you see that? He struck the child!
max,Look what dad got me! 
jerry,Whoa! Great! I have my glove in the car. We'll stop in the park on the way home and play c atch. Then tonight we'll oil
audrey,Some thing's come up. We need to talk.
max,"Mom, let's go. I want to play."
audrey, We'll talk tonight.
fletcher,Tonight?
audrey,Max's birthday?
audrey,It's the eighteenth.
fletcher,The seventeenth of May is the day I .remind myself that the eighteenth is Max's birthday. See you tonight. They drive away.
virginia,This is good. This is really smart.
fletcher,Thank you.
virginia,Only i t ' s . . . Like not true. Every word of it is a lie. Fletcher and Miranda exchange glances.
fletcher,"Mrs. Cole, the only problem here is that after you've provided years of faithful service and loving support, of raising his children -- They are his?"
virginia,H m ? Oh yeah. One for sure.
fletcher,"After all that, your husband wants to deny you a fair share of the marital assets based on one single act of"
virginia,Seven.
fletcher,Hm?
virginia,Seven single acts of indiscretion.
fletcher,"--Seven acts of indiscretion, only one of which he has any evidence of, and all of which he himself is responsible, for."
virginia,He is?
fletcher,"Mrs. Cole, I stayed up all night last night studying your c ase. Not just your case... b ut you. And, by now, I feel I know you. You are the victim here. The wife of a cold, distant businessman. Starved for affection, driven into the arms of another man--"
virginia,Seven.
fletcher,(not missing a
virginia,"Well, I did agree to give him j oint custody of the kids...  He's always been a good father."
fletcher,And you've always been a good wife.
virginia,(getting worked
fletcher,There's such a thing as being t oo nice. That's why you need aggr essive representation. To show the court that there is more than one side to this st ory. All I'm asking is the opportunity to see that justice is done on your behalf.  Will you give me that opportunity?
virginia,Yes! I ' m tired of getting kicked around.
fletcher,Good for you!
virginia,"Thank you, Mr. Reid. I ' m so grateful I have an attorney I can trust. S he gives him a HUG and momentarily grabs his ass. With a farewell nod to Miranda, she leaves. Miranda turns, smiles at Fletcher, then shuts the door. She moves in on him."
miranda,You're good. You're really good.
fletcher,"Oh, pshaw.  She picks a piece of lint off.his jacket."
miranda,"N o, I mean it. The Cole case is worth a truckload of money to this firm, not to mention the press it's going to g en er at e . You win this case and I guarantee you'll make partner."
fletcher,Excuse me? She grabs his lapels and pulls him in for a deep KISS.
audrey,(indicating the
jerry,"Well, if you don't hire your brother, who will?"
.,She heads into...  INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
jerry,They called me again from B oston. They really want me there tomorrow.
audrey,. . . I can't go to Boston.
jerry,How come?
audrey,Max.
jerry,He'll love it there.
audrey,It's Fletcher.
jerry,Fletcher?
audrey,I can't move Max three thousand miles away from his father.
jerry,"Audrey, I have never said a bad word about your ex --"
audrey,I know.
jerry,"But how much responsibility does Fletcher take for Max, now? He'd never come over if you didn't remind him."
audrey,I know. But if they're three thousand miles apart they'll never see each other. Fletcher will never come to Boston and how can I send Max cross-country to him?
audrey,"I know, it's not logical, it's emotional. I'm sorry. Pause."
jerry,I still want to marry you.
audrey,"Are you sure? Jerry picks up the PHONE, pulls out a piece of paper, dials."
jerry," Mr. Crisitelli, Jerry She!ton... I hope I'm not calling too late... Mr. Crisitelli, I'm afraid I have to turn down your offer..'. So am I . . . Well, I've fallen in love with this beautiful woman in L.A. and she doesn't want to leave and I won't leave without her... Well, thank you very much... Yes, good-bye."
audrey,Hello...
a udrey,"Fletcher, where are you? We're getting ready to cut the cake."
fletcher,"Urn, actually, something has come up. A problem on a new caaa--                . Miranda bites one of Fletcher's nipples."
audrey,What happened?
fletcher,"Nothing. I just nailed my knee into the desk... Listen, I'm really sorry I can't 'make it."
audrey,Max is going to be so disappointed.
fletcher,"I'll make it up to him, I promise. I'll pick him up from school tomorrow, okay?"
audrey,"Do you want me to put him on the phone? Miranda starts ""reeling in"" the phone cord."
fletcher,"Ah, no.     I have to go."
audrey,"Right. ANGRILY, she hangs up. Fletcher stares UNHAPPILY at the phone, before Miranda THROWS HIM BACK ONTO THE COUCH."
audrey,"All right, birthday boy, make a wish. Max doesn't respond."
max,He said he was coming. He promised.
audrey,"Yes, well, he... promises he'll see you tomorrow. Max doesn't believe it.     < He turns his full attention to the candles on the cake.   In VOICE OVER we hear what she does not."
cut to:,A clock on a wall.   It's 9:15'. We are--
miranda,"S o . . . was it good for you? Without thinking, Fletcher responds in the most astonishing way possible-- he TELLS THE TRUTH."
fletcher,I've had better. Miranda turns to him in disbelief -- but it's nothing compared to the LOOK OF SHOCK on Fletcher's face.
fletcher,"""I've had better?"""
fletcher,"""I've had better?!"""
fletcher," ""I've had better?"" I t arrives. He steps in."
fletcher,New in the building?
model,I just moved in Monday.
fletcher,"Ah. Well, you must allow me to give you the grand tour."
fletcher,No. Just the ones I want to bang like a drum. Fletcher's face REGISTERS extreme SHOCK and...
beggar,"Any change, Mister?"
beggar,Could you spare some?
fletcher,"Unquestionably. Fletcher walks faster, PUZZLED that he has answered truthfully. The beggar is even more puzzled."
beggar,Will you?
fletcher,No.
beggar,How come?
fletcher,"Because I resent your p re sen ce. You fill me with an unpleasant mixture of disgust and guilt. Further, I don't believe you'll use the money for food, but I believe you'll use it for, at worst, drugs, or, at best, whiskey, or . cigarettes. Also, I'm cheap. As Fletcher heads up the stairs..."
beggar,Jerkoff.
virginia,You look like you're having a rough morning.
fletcher,"I've had better. He WINCES as he recognizes the words. Then, an extremely wealthy, respectable industrialist, RICHARD COLE enters with his attorney, DANA APPLETON, young, brisk, confident."
dana,"Good morning, Fletcher."
fletcher,"Dana.         """
richard,"All right, Virginia, how much will it take to put an end to this?"
fletcher,Fifty per cent of your estate. Richard is SHOCKED.
dana,Fifty per cent? With a pre- nup and proof of adultery? What's your case?
fletcher,"Our case is simply this. . . Fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her -- but he CAN'T GET THE WORDS OUT. He tries to FORCE OUT SOUNDS, but succeeds only in looking like a fish gasping on dry land."
dana,Let go!
fletcher,I'm trying!
bailiff,All rise for the Honorable Judge William Stevens.
dana,"Very funny, Fletcher. You want to play hardball, I'm game. JUDGE STEVENS takes the bench."
judge stevens,"Calling case BA 09395, Richard Cole versus Virginia Cole. How're we doing this morning, counsel?"
dana,"Fine, thank you."
judge stevens,"And you, Mr. Reid?"
fletcher,"Well, I'm a little upset about a bad sexual episode I had last night-- Fletcher screeches to a standstill, suddenly aware of what he just said. After an awkward silence--"
fletcher,"Yes, Your Honor."
judge stevens,I take it you're seeking to substitute in as counsel?
fletcher,"Yes, Your Honor."
judge stevens,"Fine , fine. And for the record, the reason is?"
fletcher,"Mr. Rand had severe ethical objections to my client's case. Fletcher is incredulous. Somehow his greatest asset in the world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy."
judge stevens,"I take it you don't share the same ethical objections, Mr. Reid?"
fletcher,"I have lower standards, Your Honor."
judge stevens,"I see. Well, if Mrs. Cole wants the substitution of counsel, I'll allow it. Is that what you want, Mrs. Cole? Virginia looks to the judge, then to Fletcher, whose unorthodox syle seemed so brilliant earlier."
judge stevens,Fine.
virginia,"(aside, to"
.,"I don't know. (to judge, with"
fletcher,"I realize that, Your Honor, but I ' d really, really, really like a continuance."
judge stevens,"I'll have to hear good cause, counselor. What's the problem?"
fletcher,I can't lie!
judge stevens,Motion for a continuance denied. Is there any chance of a settlement in this case?
dana,"I don't think so, Your Honor. Mr. Reid made it abundantly clear that the last thing in the world he wanted was to --"
judge stevens,There appears to have been a change in strategy. Let's go to my chambers and negotiate. He BANGS the gavel.
dana,"Your Honor, under the terms of the prenuptual agreement, if Mrs. Cole commits adultery, she is entitled to nothing. We have in our possession an audiotape made by a licensed private investigator of an explicit act of sexual congress with a man who is not her husband."
judge stevens,"Sounds pretty damning, Mr. Reid."
fletcher,It certainly does.
dana,"However, my client has no desire to see his ex-wife destitute. Against my advice, he's willing to offer her a cash settlement of.two point four million dollars."
judge stevens,"Two four seems like a pretty fair offer, Mr. Reid."
fletcher,"Fantastically fair. Phenominally fair. In fact, I'd say beyond fair, bordering on stupid. Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness refreshing."
judge stevens,"What are you suggesting, Mr. Rei d? That Ms. Appleton's willingness to proffer such an offer betrays a lack of faith in her position?"
fletcher," No, not at all. She's got my client dead to rights. When"
dana,"Can the sarcasm, Reid. All right, I admit it -- I've seen you make even the lamest case fly. But this time I have you. Even Clarence Darrow couldn't explain this away. She brandishes the audiotape."
judge samioan,"Wel l, Mr. Reid? without a dynamite explanation, I'd say you're dead in the water. How's you client's story?"
fletcher,"The best that money can buy, Y o u r Honor."
judge stevens,Strong corroborating evidence?
fletcher,"We have evidence that you are not going to-believe. Despite herself, Dana is beginning to look worried."
judge stevens,"You're pretty confident how this trial is going to come out, eh, Mr. Reid?"
fletcher," . ""Confident"" is too weak a word, Your Honor. I am certain what will happen if I take this puppy to trial. The verdict will be a stunning, humiliating defeat that will cut a spectacularly promising legal career off at the knees. Fletcher is referring to himself, of course, but Dana thinks he's speaking about her. She buckles."
dana,"All right! Double the offer! Four point eight! And not a penny more. (venomous, to"
judge stevens,"You are some negotiator, Mr. Reid. If your client has half a brain, she'll jump at the offer."
virginia,No!
fletcher,"No? ! Mrs. Cole, this offer was a miracle. I'm talking about a walking-on-water, Lazarus-rising-from-the-dead,"
virginia,"Mr. Reid, you convinced me yesterday -- I'm the victim here, starved for affection, driven into the arms of another man--"
fletcher,Seven!
virginia,"-- Seven other men. With the story you came up with, I don't think I can lose. I want to proceed."
fletcher,"Mrs. Cole, you don't        . understand, I-- But before Fletcher can finish, the judge enters."
judge stevens,"Well , Mr. Reid. Do we have a settlement? Fletcher looks pleadingly at his client, but she is firm. He shakes his head unhappily. The judge is irritated."
jane,What do you think?
thomas,"What's shakin', Fletcher?"
fletcher,"Your cellulite, Tubster. The now panicked Fletcher breaks into a run, passing Fred."
fred,"Hiy a, Fletcher. How's the Cole case going?"
fletcher," 'Straight into the crapper, you wuss, with my career right behind it."
greta,"Hi, boss. What's happening"
greta,"Boss, what's wrong?"
fletcher,. The pen is blue!! The pen is     . b l u e ! ! The GODDAMN PEN IS
greta,Red?
greta,Are you all right?
fletcher, I have to go home.
greta,Home? Was the case settled?
fletcher,No. I have to be in court at one-thirty.
greta,"Well, then how can you.go home?"
fletcher,"I don't know, I don't know!!!"
greta,Okay. (walking on
fletcher,"I only proposed a settlement t o dick with them. I never had any intention of going th ro ug h with it.  . Not certain why her boss would .shoot himself in the foot, Greta nonetheless jots down his remarks."
greta,"'...dick with them."" Okay. Your accountant, Philip, called to remind you about getting together. ."
fletcher,I'd rather shave my ass and sit in vinegar..
greta,(jotting down a
greta,So then you're here?
greta,I ' m having a little trouble following you. what do I say to your mom?
greta,"Thanks for clearing that up. And that's it, except your ex called and asked when you were cowing over to see your son."
fletcher,"I don't think I can. I had a case I was certain would settle and it didn't. I have to go to trial this afternoon, God help me."
audrey,(not believing
fletcher,"It's true... I really do want to see Max, today. Fletcher considers what he just said, realizes it is true."
fletcher,"Yes, but-this time it's different."
audrey,I see. And how is that?
fletcher,( he walked into
audrey,But last night you weren't?
fletcher,No.
audrey,What were you doing?
fletcher,Having sex.
audrey,", It must have been with someone very ""special."""
fletcher,No. It was with someone I don't even like. But I thought it would help my career and at the moment that
max,Is dad picking me up?
audrey,"No, I'm sorry, Max. He can't make it. I will. I'll work it out. Max is disappointed."
max,I guess my wish didn't come true.
audrey,What wish?
max,"I wished that, for just one day, Dad couldn't tell a lie. Max heads toward his teacher. Audrey is deeply moved."
fletcher,"Answer, answer, answer..."
audrey,Hello.
fletcher,"Audrey, let me explain. Something has happened to me--"
audrey,"Fletcher, something else is about to happen to you."
audrey,Max and I are moving to Boston.
fletcher,What?!
audrey,Jerry asked me to marry him. He wants Max and I to fly with him this weekend to pick out a house. And I'm going to go. God knows I don't have any reason to stay here.
fletcher,"    . Wait, you can't move! If you take Max away... I'll practically never see him."
audrey,Well then you'll have pretty much the same relationship you have with him now.
fletcher,"Audrey, please.... Is this because of what I just said on the phone?"
audrey,That was the straw and this is the camel's back saying goodbye.
fletcher,Where are you?
audrey,Heading home.
fletcher,"When you gee there, stay there. I'll be right over. We have to talk."
fletcher,I'll be right- there!
miranda,"Flet cher. Fletcher, Fletcher, Fletcher. I must confess-- after last night's incident, I was. . . hurt. So hurt. I was tempted to do whatever little things lie in my power to scuttle your chances of making partner. Fletcher is FRIGHTENED."
fletcher," Uh -- not really, no."
miranda, N o ? No?! What are you sayi ng? Have you no respect for me?!
fletcher,"None, whatsoever. I mean, I ' d like to respect you, and if it weren't for your mistreatment of the associates, your rudeness to the staff, and the fact that your work sucks, I would."
m iranda,But -- what about last night?
fletcher,"I was afraid you wouldn't support my partnership if I turned you down. Plus, I have an immature need for sexual conquests."
fletcher,Gotta focus. . . gotta focus. He's so preoccupied that he speeds through a crosswalk and almost hits an OLD MAN.
fletcher,"The color of the pen is -- re d !      . But he hasn't regained the ability to lie -- he's referring to the RED LIGHT he just ran, nearly colliding with a truck. The DRIVER screams:"
driver,"What's your problem, schmuck?!"
fletcher, I ' m an inconsiderate prick!
fletc her,S hi t !!
police officer,Do you know why I stopped you?
fletcher,Depends on how long you were following me.
police officer,Why don't we take it from the top.
fletcher," Here goes -- I didn't fasten my seatbelt, I didn't glance in my rearview mirror, I didn't signal when I pulled away from the curb, I sped, I followed too closely, I ran a stop sign, I almost hit :a Chevy Camaro, I almost hit a ge ezer, I sped some more, I failed to yield at a crosswalk, I changed lanes in the intersection, I changed lanes without signalling, and I changed lanes in the"
police officer,May I see your driver's license?
fletcher,No.
police officer,And why is that?
fletcher,It's in my other pants.
police officer,I see. And where are your other pants?
fletcher,Hanging from my boss's credenza.
police officer,Do you expect me to believe that?
fletcher,No.
police officer,Do you think I'm an idiot?
fletcher,"Yes -- but that's beside the point! My license actually is in my other pants, and they actually were hanging from a credenzaJ I wouldn't lie to you! I mean, I would if I could, but I can't!"
police officer,I see. So you ..have no reason to try and hide your license from me?
fletcher,"I didn't say that. I have other reasons. Seventeen reasons, to be precise.  Unpaid parking tickets."
fletcher,"Audrey, wait!"
audrey,"Wait? You know, I just had an insight into myself. I ' m crazy. You call me up and . tell me to wait here because you'll be right over and -- here's the crazy part -- I actually wait."
fletcher,I can explain--
audrey,I missed a department meeting. I. . . Did you come in a cab?
fletcher,Yes.
audrey,Where's your car?
fletcher,Thank you. . I can't tell you how much this means to me.
audrey,"I can. One thousand, six hundred, and fifty-four dollars and eleven cents."
fletcher,Ow.
fletcher,Right there!
fletcher,(angrier and
audrey,"Well I can't remember when I've had more fun, now if you'll excuse me, I have a class. She starts out."
fletcher,"Audrey, wait. I want to talk to you about this Boston situation."
fletcher,You can't go. It's not fair. Taking Max three thousand miles away is not fair.
audrey,"Let' s define ""fair."" Last night a five-year old boy was crushed because his father lied to him about coming to his birthday party. Fair?"
fletcher,Last night--
audrey,"-- Was none of my business. When it happened two years ago it was my business, but now I don't have to care anymore. See, that's the magic of div orce . But it does matter to Max. Everything you do matters to him... and everything you don't do."
fletcher,"All right-- now let me tell you something...you're absolutely right. I'm guilty of all charges. I'm throwing myself on the mercy of your -court. Audrey doesn't know what to say. Fletcher seems very sincere, but she can't trust him."
audrey,We're suppose to be on a plane
fletcher,"No, Audrey. Just talk to me abou t this first. Please. Au drey, I've lost you. Don't make me lose Max, too."
audrey,You're really coming?
fletcher,This is iron-clad. This is the mother of all promises. What time?
audrey,...Six?
fletcher,Ten-to-six.
audrey,"I hope so. Do you know what your son was doing at nine- fif teen las t ni ght? He was making a wish on his birthday c ake. He was wishing that, for just one day, his dad couldn't tell a lie. She drives away. Fletcher starts for his car, pensive, when a new thought strikes him."
fletcher,"Oh my God! That-'s it! An innocent kid - - a heartfelt plea-- a birthday wish! Sure, it' s impossible --but it 'makes sense!..! If he can wish it, he can unwish it!"
max,Dad!
fletcher,"Hi. Listen, I need to talk to"
max,Mr. Reid it'would be wonderful for the children to hear something positive about lawyers!
fletcher,"Well, actually--"
fletcher,"Uh, hi. Uh, I'm a lawyer and I work at a big law firm with a lot of other lawyers and I do stuff in a law court. Thank you. He starts out."
questions, Jeffrey?
jeff,What kind of lawyer are you?
fletcher,"Mostly, I ' m a divorce lawyer."
billy,What's that?
fletcher,"It means if you're daddy left your mommy, he'd call me."
craig,So what do you do?
fletcher, I help people fight over their money and their children.
theodore,Can't they fight without you?
jill,Why would my daddy leave my mommy?
fletcher,"To marry a younger woman. To escape a loveless marriage and have cheap meaningless sex. To cling to an illusion of youth as his body gives way to sore backs, flat feet, spare tires, gum disease, hair loss, liver spots, kidney stones, clogged arteries, diabetes, goiter and eventual death. The kids EYES GO WIDE. A moment, then:"
fletcher,Monster-Max.
max,Dadzilla. You came to play catch?
fletcher,"No. I ' d like to, but I can't right now. Max is disappointed again."
max,Stupid. His big nose and stupid orange hair...
fletcher,"That's why he should have worn make-up. Fletcher elbows Max, playfully, trying to induce a laugh. Max doesn't laugh."
fletcher,"Yeah, okay, urn... Your mother told me about... the wish you made last night. It came true. Max is amazed."
max,Really? You mean you have to tell the truth?
fletcher,Yes.
max,No matter what?
fletcher,No matter what.
max,Is wrestling real?
fletcher,"In the Olympics, yes.      On    . Channel 23, no."
max,Will sitting close to the TV set make me go blind?
fletcher,Not in a million years.
max,If I keep making this face-- (makes a horrible
fletcher,Uh-uh.
max,".If I go in the water right after lunch, will I drown?"
fletcher,Only if you can't 'swim.
max,Why do I have to eat squash?
fletcher,Because your mom buys it.
max,How come you're always too busy to play with me? The sudden shift in tone startles Fletcher. He feels awful.
fletcher,"I . . . I don't know. I ' m . . . Hey, you know I'm coming over to nig ht. We're gonna play together."
max,Baseball?
fletcher,". Yes! This is absolutely an A-number one promise. You and I -- tonight -- baseball. Fletcher and Max do their ritual ""five"" slap."
fletcher,"Now, listen, Max, I need a favor from you. I ' m in a little trouble today. I need you to take that wish back."
max,So you can lie?
fletcher,Not to you.
max,To who?
fletcher,"Max, sometimes grownups... need to lie. It's hard to explain, but i f . . . Look, here's an example. When Mommy was pregnant with you, she gained a little weight. Se venty pounds. I thought she was gonna give birth to a car. But she'd say to me ""How do I lo ok?"" So I'd say, ""Oh, honey, you're beautiful, you're glowing.11 Otherwise, I would've hurt Mommy's fee ling s. Understand? Max nods."
max,You didn't think she was beautiful.
fletcher,"Right. No... Max, I don't know how to get along in the grown-up world if I have to stick to the truth. I could lose my case, I could lose my promotion, I could even lose, my job... Do you understand? Max shakes his head ""no."""
max,I did it. ^
fletcher,Great! Great! Now to test --
max,Did it work?
max,Only...
fletcher,Only what?
max,"Yesterday, when I wished it, I r ea lly meant it. This time when I unwished it I only did it 'cause you told me to."
fletcher," Well, then do it again.        Only this time, mean it."
max,I can't.
fletcher,Why not?!
max,Because I don't want you to lie.
fletcher,"I explained this to you! I have to lie. Everybody lies! Mommy lies, even the wonderful Jerry lies--"
max,But you're the only one who makes me feel bad.
max,I have to go.
fletcher,"I am coming over, tonight, Max. You believe me, don't you? Max hesitates, then nods."
macho attorney,"Yo, Fletcher! How's it hanging?"
fletcher,Short and shrivelled. Fletcher hurries up the steps when he spots Philip. He shields his face with his briefcase. Philip recognizes him anyway.
philip,Fletcher! I'm still waiting for your call. I guess you must've lost my card --
fletcher,No --
philip,Or my phone was busy --
fletcher,No --
philip,Or you just forgot --
fletcher,No --
philip,(cannot be
fletcher,"Philip... I don't want to come over to your house! A long moment, then --"
philip,"Fi n e ! We'll go out! There's this new karaoke bar I've been dying to try. I'll pick you up at your office! Seven- thirty! ! And he runs off.   Frustrated, Fletcher hurries on."
greta,Do you want your messages?
fletcher,"No. He goes into his office. Greta is concerned.   She follows him in, leaving his door open."
greta,Are you okay?
fletcher,My son hates me.
greta,No! He loves you. I've seen y ou together. You're his hero.
fletcher,"O h yeah? Last night at his birthday party, he made a wish. That I wouldn't be able to tell a lie for one whole day."
greta,Kids...
fletcher,It came true.
greta,What?
fletcher,It's true. Didn't it seem odd to you that I kept telling the truth all morning?
greta,"Well, yeah, but..."
fletcher,That's right!     I am incapable of lying.
greta,Just today?
fletcher,Apparently until 9:15 tonight. It's a twenty-four hour curse.
greta,"Yes, those are going around."
fletcher,You don't believe me.
greta,Of course not.
fletcher,Go ahead. Ask me something I ' d normally lie about. She thinks.
greta,"A ll right. Remember a few months ago, I wanted a raise--"
greta,-- and the firm wouldn't.give me one. And I asked you if you would give it to me out of your own pocket and you said the company wouldn't permit it because it creates jealousy among the other secretaries? Was that true or did you just not want to pony up the dough?
fletcher,"Greta, please...  Yes Judge Stevens, hi!.. Fletcher Reid. I ' m scheduled to be in your court in half- an-hour... Judge Stevens, I badly, badly need a continuance. . . so I can go home and stay there the rest of the day...111? Am I ill? He wants to say ""yes"", but he can't."
fletcher,In a way. (covers the

greta,A few years ago a friend of mine had a burglar up on her roof.
fletcher,Yes?
fletcher,No. . . but what' s your poijit!
greta,"My point is, it's hard to get justice. But this is justice, (pinches his"
fletcher,Aaaah! Miranda smiles like a cat that's trapped a mouse.
miranda,"Ah, Fletcher, so nice to bump i nto you. Are you busy?"
fletcher,Extremely.
miranda,"Good. Would you follow me, please? Highly nervous, Fletcher follows Miranda down the hall."
miranda,"Pardon me for interrupting your, meeting. Mr. Allan, you remember Fletcher Reid."
miranda,"Oh, that's right. You used to work together. .Tell me, what do you think of Mr. Allah? Fl etc he r gulps. This is it. His career is history. He's trying to hold it back, but--"
miranda,I said... What do you think of Mr. Allan?
fletcher,"Well, I'm due in court... bye- bye."
bailiff,All rise. They do. Judge Stevens enters. He sits. Everyone sits.
judge stevens,"Counselors, are we ready to begin?"

falk,"I couldn't find any water, so I got him coffee! Fletcher runs up and down the steps, frantically fanning h is scalded mouth. The bailiff appears."
bailiff,Judge is taking the bench. Fletcher's expression turns to terror.
judge stevens,"You may proceed, Mr. Reid. . Everyone turns to Fletcher in anticipation.    In a voice quaking with fear..."
virginia,"Sorry. One of the kids threw up in the car. Virginia takes her seat, leaving her two young children sitting dejectedly in the gallery with their nanny."

bryson,"Well, they were pretty good about keeping the shades drawn -- but I sure was able to hear. I made an audiotape of one such., ""session."" H e hands her the tape. Fletcher refills his glass."
dana,"With the Court's permission, I would like to play the tape."
fletcher,"Your Honor, I object!"
judge stevens,"And why is that, Mr. Reid?"
fletcher,(can't help
judge stevens,"Overruled.. As Dana pops the tape into a player, Fletcher anxiously"
dana,Your witness.
fletcher,No questions.
judge stevens,No questions? .
virginia,No questions?
fletcher,(afraid to ask
judge stevens,"All right, Mr. Reid. You may proceed."
fletcher," How?! Gathering his courage, he stands, downs the last of his water, and moves to the lecturn. He's about to speak... when a WONDERFUL FEELING sweeps through him. After a momement, he grins."
judge stevens,It can't wait?
fletcher,Not unless you want to mop up.
fletcher,"What did I think? That I could piss for forty-five minutes?! He HITS HIS FOREHEAD in frustration... and gets an idea. He HITS HIMSELF AGAIN and AGAIN, SMASHES HIS HEAD INTO THE WALL, POKES HIMSELF IN THE EYES, YANKS ON HIS EARS, finally KNOCKS HIMSELF IN THE STALL, where he continues his attack. A MAN enters, hears a commotion from behind the stall door."
man,What's going on in-there?
bailiff,I found him like this in the bathroom. Somebody beat the hell out of him.
judge stevens,Who did this?
judge stevens,-What did he look like?
judge stevens,"Bailiff, have the deputies search the building. A HUBBUB rises. He bangs the gavel."
fletcher,"Yes, I can."
judge stevens,"Splendid. I admire your courage, Mr. Reid. I'll give you a few minutes to compose yourself, and then we'll get started. Fletcher looks as if he has just been sentenced to death."
fletcher,Hello.
max,Dad...
fletcher,(summoning up
max,Great. You know Paul and Emanuel from across the street?
fletcher,The twins.
fletcher,Sure.
max,Oh boy. We're setting up a whole field in the yard. Where we buried Petey the hamster is second base.  You're still coming right?'
fletcher,(sees Virginia
max," He's really coming. She smiles, but she's worried. ."
virginia,"Mr. Reid, you remember Laurence Falk, the man from the tape."
falk,How are you?
fletcher,"I've slipped into the seventh circle of Hell, thank you, and you? Virginia exchanges an anxious look with Falk."
virginia,Shouldn't we go over our testimony?
fletcher,"Well, basically the plan is I walk you through the tape step by step, I ask you questions--"
virginia,And we give the explanation you came up with.
fletcher,Exactly.
falk,So all we have to do is lie. Sounds simple enough.
fletcher,"Do esn't it? And I'll finish up with a dramatic series of questions, something like... ""Mr. Falk, isn't it true that you and Mrs. Cole have never made lo--"" But Fletcher GAGS. He CAN'T GET THE QUESTION OUT.   The others look concerned, but he waves them off."
fletcher, Oh my God! I can't do it! I can't finish the question if I know the answer is a lie! At this moment Miranda and Mr. Allan come up the steps.
fletcher,C'mon! Gotta rephrase the question!
fletcher,Respondent calls... Lawrence Falk. Fletcher's clears his throat.       Here goes...
fletcher,"Mr. Falk, do you know my client, Virginia Cole?"
falk,Yes.
fletcher,"Isn't it true that your relationship with my client is entirely platonic, not? The ""not"" was INVOLUNTARY.       It takes everyone by surprise."
falk,Excuse me?
fletcher,"If I might rephrase your Honor.  Is your relationship with my client entirely patonic, not?"
fletcher,"Yes, is your relationship with my client not entirely platonic, or yes, is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic?"
falk,What?
fletcher,How 'bout just answering the question you think I'm asking?              '
dana,"Your Honor, he's badgering the wintness!"
judge stevens,It's hig witness!
fletcher,Did you ever not make lo-- Did you not ever make lo-- 
fletcher,(screaming at
dana,Uh...no questions.
judge stevens, Call your next witness.
fletcher,"I have no further witnesses, your Honor. A MURMUR erupts from the crowd."
judge stevens,You have no further witnesses?!
virginia,"(whispers, to"
fletcher, I can't.
judge stevens,Mr. Reid?
virginia,"Call me, damn it!"
fletcher,"You don't understand. I can't lie . Until nine-sixteen tonight, I can't even.ask a question that calls for a lie! Virginia GRABS HIM BY THE TIE, pulls him CLOSE to her face."
virg inia,"L is ten , you bastard. I want m y money. I am not gonna wind up a 31 year old divorce on welfare because my scum bag attorney had a sudden attack of conscience! Fletcher suddenly stops -- focused on something Virginia said."
fletcher, Thirty-one?
judge stevens,"Mr. Reid, we're not getting any younger... Fletcher quickly looks at the blowup of Virginia's prenup and her passport."
judge stevens, Mr. Reid you have presented virtually nothing in the way of evidence and as such I have no choice but to rule in favor of --
fletcher, WAIT!
miranda,Kissing his career goodbye. The Baliff stands before the witness.
balifp,"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help -you God?"
virginia,"I do. Fletcher approaches,. CONFIDENT NOW, COCKY."
fletcher,Mrs. Cole -- may I call you Virginia?
virginia,Yes.
fletcher,"But that would be a lie, wouldn't it?"
virginia,What do you mean?
fletcher,Isn't your true name...
virginia,"Well, yes. But it wasn't me so I started using Virginia. Is there anything wrong with that?"
f letcher,Your driver's license. What color are your eyes?
virginia,Blue.
fletcher,Tru e blue? What if I asked you to remove your contact l enses? What color would they be then?
fletcher,"And here it says you're a b l on de . Are you?  C'mon, Carlotta, there's a very easy way for us to check. If you don't remember, perhaps Mr. Falk will."
virginia,Brunette.
fletch er,"More like a dirty brown, isn't it?  Let's see - . - "" Weight: one-o- five""? Please..."
fletcher,"So on this single document, you basically lied at every opportunity. I'm sure a woman as vain as you would also lie about her age. It says you were born in 1964. What's the truth? 1962? '60? How young did you try to make yourself?"
virginia,"Yes! ""  lied so I could get married! So .there Mister 'I"
judge stevens,"Mr. Reid, does this have a point?"
fletcher,"Oh, you bet it does, your Honor!  My client lied about her age because she was only 17 when s he got married. Which makes h er a minor. And in the great state of California, NO MINOR"

virginia,No!   I'm contesting custody.
fletcher,What?
virginia, Payback. For him trying to prevent me from collecting my thirty-seven million.
fletcher,"He was entitled to prevent you. You committed adultery.' You only won because you're a liar, remember? ."
virginia,No. You pointed out that my husband took advantage of a poor underage girl. I was the vic tim here. And now I'm going to hit him where it hurts.
fletcher,But -- but -- you said he was a good father.
judge stevens,M r. Reid? Do we have an agreement on custody or not? Fletcher takes a distressed look at the children.
fletcher,No.                                            .
judge stevens,"In that case, there will be a custody hearing tomorrow mor ning at nine. Court is adj ourned! He BANGS THE GAVEL. Everyone gets up, but Fletcher's attention is drawn to a commotion between Virginia and her kids."

max,When would we move?
audrey,"Soon. My semester's almost over. You only have a week left of school... You like Jerry don't you?  So what do you say, should we check it out? Jerry wants us to come with him tonight. He has to pick out a place to live and he really wants our help?"
