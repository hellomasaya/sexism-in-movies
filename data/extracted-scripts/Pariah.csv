arthur,Umm-hmm.
audrey,She needs a male point of view.
arthur,"I said okay, dammit! Now can I please have a beer please?"
audrey,It's Sunday morning.
arthur,It goes with the spaghetti.
audrey,Do you have to work tonight?
arthur,"To put food on the table and clothes on our backs, no. To go out to restaurants and keep designer sneakers in the closet, yes."
audrey,Are you forever gonna be mad?
arthur,Are you forever going to be happy?  You made that decision a long time ago.
audrey,We both made sacrifices.
arthur,"You look beautiful, baby."

audrey,"Alrighty, I'll be around. Take care."
alike,You're funny.
audrey,I don't know what your problem is.
sharonda,Can somebody put in this CD please?
alike,I don't know what you think is going to change.
audrey,I know God doesn't make mistakes. I know that much.
sharonda,"Moooom, can you--"
audrey,Be quiet. Nobody's putting in anything. I'm gonna listen to what I want to listen to for a change.
bina,"Look, I don't like lying to my mother, that's all."

bina,She does.    She asks me everyday.
alike,So tell her yeah.
bina,"No, I'm sick of lying to cover for you."
alike,So don't.
bina,"Look Alike, Lee. Whatever it is you wanna be called. I'm not trying to hang out with you, either, but I'm not about to take an L for it. So stop dodging me, let's just go to school together and be done with it. We don't have to see each other any other time than that."
alike,Hey!
bina,"Yeah, you sorry your mom is gonna bug out."
alike,"No for real, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be that way. It's just... OK, I am concerned that my, my mom will find out, but..."
bina,But?
alike,"It's not like that. It's just-- she's just. If you knew her, you'd understand. She's like, I don't know."
bina,You don't have to make small talk. Let's just walk.
alike,"I said I'm sorry. It's not you, it's just that my mom is like, she's like..."
bina,Overprotective?
alike,Yeah.
bina,"I can tell. I've seen--I mean, a lot of people's parents are like that."
alike,Yeah?
bina,Yeah.
alike,Yeah. But probably not like mine. But anyway...
bina,"Anyway, like I said, we don't have to talk. Just walk."

arthur,I said a sip. A sip!
alike,Nothin'.
arthur,"They like you? Or they like you, like you?"
alike,"Say they like you, like you."
arthur,Uh-huh.
alike,"I mean, they haven't said anything yet. But what if... so what if the person is kinda like a friend, but you know they like you more than that?"
arthur,"Well, I think that's the best way to start--as friends."
alike,But then what if...What if the person is --
alike,Yeah.
arthur,"Say uh--there's this new--uh women's club up there by the liquor store--have you--do you--you haven't heard anything about it, right?"
alike,"Nah, I never even heard of it."
arthur,Good. `Cause you know that's a uh...it's a rough neighborhood. You know that right? I had a case over there. You wanna be careful--stay away from that element. Just in case it ever comes up?
alike,I'll be careful.
arthur,Good. I know you will.
alike,"Dad, when you were on the phone earlier? It sounded like...I mean...I guess you're headed back to work, huh?"
arthur,Yep. Your mama still up?
alike,Probably.
arthur,Tell her I had to work.
laura,"My sister gets home at six so, you gotta be gone by then."
laura,"There's some lunchmeat in there too, help yourself."
alike,Hey.
bina,Hey.
alike,I'm sorry about the other day.
bina,It's cool.
bina,You still coming to the party?
alike,I don't know--I need to try and catch up with Laura.
bina,Oh.
alike,But I do wanna hang out...I mean...maybe we could do both.
bina,Cool.  You could spend the night if want to. Avoid the whole curfew thing.
alike,Yeah...
bina,You sure?
alike,Yeah.
arthur,"Easy, easy now. Watch your right hand side."
alike,I am.
arthur,Don't ride the brakes though. Good.
alike,See? I'm getting better!! Can I drive back?
arthur,"I don't about that. You're shaky girl, you're shaky. Get us some chips and I'll think about it."
mack,"Hey, baby!"
alike,Hey Mr. Ferguson!
mack,I see Alike's been running circles around you again!
arthur,"Little bit, little bit. I still got it though."
arthur,We better get going.
arthur,I'll holler at you later.
alike,But you said I could drive--
arthur,I said get in the car!
arthur,"Look...umm...you know you're daddy's girl, right?"
audrey,Oh you're home?
arthur,Hey.
audrey,I must've dozed off. How long have you been in?
arthur,Hour.
audrey,Did you see the plate in there?
arthur,This is fine.
audrey,There's room over here. You can see the TV better.
arthur,This is fine.
audrey,Just alike.
arthur,Say what?
audrey,You and your daughter. Have you talked to Lee yet? I told you she--
arthur,I talked to Alike.
audrey,You did?
arthur,"Everything's fine. Like I told you. Matter fact, she's got a boyfriend."
audrey,Boyfriend?
arthur,Just give her some space.
audrey,"Space? She's hardly ever home in the first place and you're just like her, creeping in all hours of the night. Both of you. Running around like you got something to hide, like I'm the big, bad witch and what about me? I'm home by myself all the time and Sharonda's getting older and starting to go out and pretty soon--"
arthur,I don't have anything to hide. Look I told you I talked to Alike and everything is fine.
audrey,Did you ask her?
arthur,"No, because I didn't have to. Besides,I would know okay? If anybody would know, it would be me. I know my daughter--"
audrey,Your daughter?!!
arthur,--better than anyone else and--
audrey,So now all of a sudden she's just your daughter?!
arthur,"That's your damn problem, you're too much of a damn worry wart."
audrey,"Let's hope you're right, Detective."
arthur,Will you shut the fuck up?!
audrey,An hour? Really? I'm not your dumb damn floozy in the street. And you will not talk to me that way.
alike,I know you're not scared.
sharonda,I'm not.
alike,Hmm?
sharonda,I hope you know it doesn't matter to me.
alike,I know.
alike,So whatchu you think? She's cool right?
laura,This one's just for me and you.
alike,"And she's smart, too. She does poetry, you should hear it. It's like, it's good, you know?"
laura,"Look, I'm right here."
laura,"Look, I'm sorry for all the drama."
alike,"No, it's cool. I shoulda--"
laura,"What I'm saying is, I probably overreacted.  And then...I don't know. Seeing you two together or whatever. I'm glad to see you're finally happy."
alike,"C'mon man, you know you're my best friend. Nobody's gonna --"
laura,"You don't need to say anything. I just wanted to get it off my chest. I'm happy for you, that's all."
mika,We goin' to get something to eat?
laura,That's what's up.
alike,"Listen, umm--"
laura,"That's for later. Bina, nice to meet you."
bina,"You too. We had fun.  Laura gives Bina a polite hug, pounds Alike on the shoulder and starts to lead Mika away.  MIKA                                 ALIKE Byyeee!!                           Hey hold up!  Laura pumps a lazy    fist in the air in acknowledgement. Bina takes Alike's hand    and slowly drags her away. Alike keeps looking back, then    finally gives up. Laura looks back just as Alike turns around    and disappears around the corner.  BINA  I like your friends. They're cool."
alike,I'm not sleep.
bina,Yes you are.
alike,Any brownies left?
bina,Nope.
alike,What?
bina,Nothing.
alike,Nothing.
bina,What're you doing? What's wrong?
alike,"This is uh... I never... I'm sorry, I'm trippin' out."
bina,It's okay. We don't have to.
laura,Oh.
alike,Hey.
bina,Hey.
alike,You up already?
bina,"It's after one o'clock, actually."
alike,What's wrong?
bina,"Nothin's wrong, I'm just cleaning up. Don't worry about it."
alike,"Okay then, I'll help you."
bina,"No, I got it."
alike,Look um--I just wanted to say that last night...last night was amazing...thank you for--
bina,"Last night we were just playin' around, that's all."
alike,Look... We can slow things down... Nobody has to know that we're together.
bina,"""Together""? Whoa, no..."
alike,"Huh?! I thought... Look if you don't want to call it that, that's fine, but don't act like nothing happened."
bina,"Look, I'm not gay okay? This isn't me--I wasn't--I'm not ready for all this..."
alike,What?
bina,You promise you won't tell anybody?
audrey,Where in the hell have you been?!

arthur,"Audrey, stop it!! Alike go back to bed!"
audrey,"Meanwhile, your daughter's turning into a damn man right before your very eyes, and you can't even see it!!"
