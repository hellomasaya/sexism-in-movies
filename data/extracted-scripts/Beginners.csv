Speaker,Dialogue
andy,Okay. Is it on? 
oliver,Yeah yeah.
andy,This is for our friend Hal Fields. Hal. We love you.
oliver,You're coming to live with me now. Arthur looks at him.
oliver,This is my car. Arthur hops in.
oliver,"This is the dining room where people come and eat sometimes. The dog listens intently. Oliver moves on, the dog follows."
oliver,This is the living room.
oliver,That's the bathroom. The dog looks.
oliver,He was a museum director - she fixed up old houses.
oliver,"They had a child, and they stayed married for 44 years..."
hal,"I'm gay. Same camera angle, Hal still looking into camera we jump cut to him wearing a robe."
hal,"I'm gay. Same angle, we continue to jump cut through Hal talking to camera, each cut in different clothes, and with each cut his line has a different inflection.  HAL  ...I want to do something about it."
andy,"Since I came out to my father, he never speaks to me. That's why I've been always attracted to older men. Hal and friends laugh warmly at Andy. We cut to live action ""portraits"" of a priest, a therapist, the Primetimers, his movie-night club, and the large L.A. Pride group, all looking into camera.  OLIVER V.O. He found an out gay priest to guide him spiritually. He saw a therapist for the first time. He joined the Primetimers. Movie night. Los Angeles Pride, and then..."
oliver,"Look, its lonely out here, so you'd better learn how to talk with me. Arthur's face looks up at him filled with a dog's love and no words."
arthur subtitle,"While I understand up to 150 words - I don't talk. Oliver leans down, pushing his head into Arthur's."
oliver,I know. I know.
oliver,"Calm. Calm, calm breaths. Hal coughs."
hal,Oliver! Please help me with all these ropes. Oliver rushes and helps him.
oliver,"Pop, Pop, stop -- you're gonna hurt yourself. A NURSE quickly enters and helps hold down his arms."
nurse,"Mr. Fields, we're going to have to secure your arms again."
hal,You two married?
oliver,"No, Pop."
hal,"Why not? She's great. The nurse smiles, embarrassed, and continues with her job."
oliver,"She's a great nurse in the hospital, we don't really know her, you're very high on drugs."
hal,"You always have some very good reason, haven't you?"
oliver,"No, Pop, I just don't want to be like you and mom.  Thank you..."
georgia,"Oliver! He turns and Georgia shoots him with her finger, Oliver falls to the ground."
georgia,"Olly, you can do better. He gets up and she shoots him again - He falls more dramatically, knocking his head on the floor."
georgia,That's good. His mom looks at him affectionately.
oliver,Want me to read this? I found it in your books.
hal,"Yeah, alright. Give me the flashlight. Oliver opens it, they look at a few pages together, photos of serene gardens."
oliver,Nice.
hal,"Oh, that's nice."
oliver,"Oh, Andy brought those for you."
hal,"Oh, yeah? Hal continues to direct the light across the room, we follow the circle of light as it moves a cross a wall landing on a painting."
hal,"Oh, who did that painting?"
oliver,"Well, I don't know. Its just a painting on the wall. Hal continues exploring, Oliver's enjoying his father's curiosity, he lands on some photos displayed on the table."
hal,"A--, and these?"
oliver,"They're just photos, Pop."
hal,But how do they relate to the exhibit?
oliver,"They're just personal photos. They're not art. Hal slowly moves the flashlight up the wall, across the ceiling to a strange assortment of fire detectors, sprinklers, sensors, all laid out against the acoustic tile ceiling. Hal points up. Oliver looks for a beat, then..."
oliver,"Uh, well that's the water sprinkler thing."
hal,"Well, its beautiful."
oliver,What is?
hal,Putting the Japanese gardens there. It's just beautiful.
andy,Hal.
hal,"Andy! Andy gets on the bed opposite Oliver. He gives Hal a big kiss on the lips. Hal glows. Oliver backs away slowly. Andy picks up Hal's hand, turns it palm up and presses his face into it."
andy,I brought something for you. Oliver watches from outside the room as Andy excitedly pulls a portable tape player out of his bag.
andy,We made a recording for you.
hal,"Oh, God. Andy pushes play, on the recording we hear Andy's voice:"
oliver,"Jesus, Liz. Another band that wants portraits."
liz,"Well, at least it pays the rent."
oliver,"You do something decent once, and that's all people ever want. JUMP CUT through the different portraits developing. It's not what Oliver want's to do."
elliott,"Hi Liz. Oliver continues to draw, as Shauna and Elliott try to get his attention."
elliott,Oliver?
oliver,Yeah?
elliott,The pen is not your friend. The paper is not your friend. The party is your friend. We're your friends. Your friends are your friends.
shauna,I got the skills... he's got the moves...
elliott,I got the moves... you've got the skills...
oliver,"Arthur, you haven't been invited to this party. You're gonna stay and look after the house. Oliver tentatively shuts the door, takes three steps, Arthur begins to howl. Oliver tries to ignore it, but stops again. He looks back at the house and the howling."
elliott,"You remember when Oliver was funny? And he could actually, like, talk, in complete sentences?"
shauna,"Funny? Funny? I don't think so Fun maybe, but not funny unless, like, serious is funny. Then he's' fucking hilarious. Elliot and Oliver laugh."
shauna,"But, lovable. You are very lovable."
elliott,"Yeah, very lovable."
female partier,"So cute, does he do tricks?"
oliver,"His name's Arthur - he doesn't do tricks. In the background are a couple dressed as JULIAN and ETHEL ROSENBERG, we see them observe Oliver and Arthur."
partier,"No? Arthur, SIT! Arthur promptly sits down. Oliver's totally surprised."
partier,He's so cute. Shake! Arthur sticks out his paw. Oliver doesn't like seeing Arthur blindly perform.
partier,"Oh my god, he's so cute, I want him."
oliver, Does it make you feel powerful to order my dog around? Maybe give you a sense of power?
partier,"Oh, you're being a therapist! Freud!"
oliver,"Thanks, yeah. Very good. Oliver picks up Arthur and escapes the kitchen. The Rosenberg's are still watching."
oliver,Yeah.
oliver," I'm sorry. Our time is up, uh... for this week. Thank you for coming in. The witch moves on. Oliver sits with Arthur in his lap, alone, lost in all this joviality. We see that the woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg is watching him. Just as Oliver is about to get up, she plops herself down onto the couch, ready for her session."
oliver," Well, I guess we should start with your mother. The woman writes on her notepad and shows it to Oliver: ""Never had one."""
oliver,Well then your father. She mimes shooting herself in the head and dying.
oliver,"I don't understand. You can't talk? Is it a mental problem? Do you need analysis? She writes on her pad: ""I have laryngitis"""
oliver,"That's a physical problem. She smiles at him, looks at him a little too long, Oliver is more and more pulled in by her playfulness - she writes: ""Why are you at a party if you're sad?"" CU on Oliver, surprised and impressed by her observation."
oliver,I was doing such a good job of hiding it. How could you tell? Ethel holds up her notebook. She has drawn TWO EYES. Oliver's taken by her.
oliver,"Clearly, I'm gonna need a drink. You? She smiles and nods."
oliver,"You, stay here, yeah? Oliver moves to--"
int kitchen,Elliot and Shauna are deeply engaged in conversation with someone dressed as a pickle and someone dressed as much less colorful chicken.
elliott,"No, its just not a natural color for a chicken."
shauna,No.
elliott,(motioning to Shauna's
shauna,You just have no real color.
elliott,"Hey, hey."
elliott,Two drinks.
shauna,"What does that me--, one, two."
elliott,"Well that's two, two people."
shauna,Two people. A girl and a guy?
elliott,Hopefully.
shauna,"Yeah, wow, making moves. Oliver leaves Arthur in Elliott's arms."
oliver,Watch him OK? Oliver begins to leave his drinks. We see his POV of the woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg waiting on the couch. Oliver slips into one of his memories...
oliver,Hello?
hal,Oliver?
oliver,Yeah.
hal,I'm not sorry I woke you! I went to Akbar tonight.
oliver,You did?
hal,"""House music."""
oliver,"Would you like to dance? She happily nods yes. They walk to the dance floor, we think Oliver's going to be shy, but he breaks into a kinetic, angular, dance. She's surprised with us - she laughs, they have a good time."
oliver,"Hello... Shes mouths a silent ""hi""..."
oliver,Can I give you my number? She pulls out her pad and pen and hands them to him.
oliver,"Thanks. As he writes, Oliver spies Arthur sitting in the corner of the bathroom, staring directly at him."
arthur subtitle,Tell her the darkness is about to drown us unless something drastic happens right now. Oliver looks to her.
oliver,"I feel bad dragging Arthur to the party. I should get home. It was really nice meeting you. She writes on her pad: ""Au Revoir"""
oliver,"Hello? ON THE OTHER END: Silence. A little breathing, the party in background."
oliver,"Okay. You point - I'll drive. Oliver starts the engine. She points forward and they head off. At the light she points left, he follows. Down the street she points right..."
oliver,This way?
oliver,"Nice place. They sit on her bed. She steals his pipe, put's it in her mouth -- writes on her pad and shows it to him."
anna, Oh merd.
oliver,"Oh, you spoke."
oliver,"My father died two months ago, almost three. She looks at him with sincere empathy and surprise. Oliver's opened up, an now everything gushes out, he barely knows what he's saying."
oliver,"Oliver. She writes again: ""Go to NY. Audition. Back Thursday."""
oliver,How long are you here when you get back? Anna holds up one finger.
oliver,A year? Anna shakes her head and smiles. She gestures smaller.
oliver,"A month? Right. And then?... She pantomimes a camera rolling, and herself acting."
oliver,You're filming here. Acting.
oliver,And after?... She makes a casual tossing motion with her hand.
oliver,"Just somewhere else. Where? Anna only shrugs. She writes more, and tosses the notepad on his lap. Oliver reads: ""Can I see you again?"" He's very happy."
oliver,Yes.
oliver,"Hello house,  hello Oliver."
oliver,"Jesus, Pop, you get so much mail. Oliver slows and stares at his father's magazine - The Advocate. Two attractive, shirtless men on the cover under the title: America's Sweethearts. Oliver's lost in memory..."
hal,But...?
doctor long,The bronchoscopy revealed a mass about the size of a quarter. It is located in your lower right lung. CU on Hal taking this in.
hal,Uh-huh. I see.
doctor long,It appears to have spread... to the large hilar lymph nodes in your chest and liver.
doctor long,Do you have any questions?
hal,No. Thank you. As the doctor leaves. Oliver takes his father's hand.
oliver,I'm sorry.
hal,"Well, let's not rush out and tell everyone."
oliver,Andy?
hal,No need to get him up a tree. Hal takes a moment and composes himself. In his eyes we can see that he knows there is an end to his life.
oliver,"The Brazilian ballet star is already known not only as a skilled partner, but also as a gifted and versatile dancer, who adeptly fields roles ranging... Camera tracks out of the room, leaving the two men alone..."
hal,But is he eating?
oliver,"Yeah, yeah, he's eating."
hal,"Oh God, I worry so much about-- As Andy enters, his hands mysteriously cupped together."
hal,Oh here we are... Andy shows Hal his cupped hands.
andy,A slug.
hal,"Oh, Andy, you can't bring that kind of thing in here."
andy,"Oh I can look. Andy flashes open his hands, revealing nothing. He snorts and laughs."
hal,Fuck you. Oliver watches with amusement. NURSE SOPHIA enters...
hal,It's time for inspection... The nurse works her way between Andy and Hal to take his pulse.
nurse,"Hello, Mr. Fields."
hal,"Hello. Andy feels interrupted, strangely hurt by the nurse. The nurse begins to take Hal's vital signs."
andy,I'm Andy. Hal's boyfriend
nurse,I'm Sophia. Andy gets more and more upset.
andy,"You know, I have the right to be here as much as anyone else. Hal lovingly cuts him off, trying to ease the tension."
hal,"Go take a walk. Calm yourself. Andy walks out, feeling embarrassed and rejected."
oliver,What was all that?
hal,"Oh, Andy hasn't had it easy. Be nice to him. To everyone's surprise, Andy storms back in with a bouquet of flowers, dumps them on Hal's chest, kisses him triumphantly and leaves again."
hal," Andy, where did you get these?"
andy,"Guys, guys, this is to us. Cheers. A NURSE suddenly enters."
strict nurse,Drinking's not allowed in the room. All the guys freeze.
hal,"Oh, it's not? She shakes her head no, the party stops, she leaves. Oliver instinctively polite, starts packing up their cups."
oliver,I'm sorry. Moans and complaints from the group.
hal,"No, no, no. She's a wonderful nurse.  Here's to health care. Hal swigs back his wine. They all laugh, grab their cups and toast."
everyone,"To health care! Hal looks happy, Oliver smiles but can't believe his dad."
oliver,What did you do with my father? He was so polite.
hal,"Oh, I invited him - but he never returns my calls. The guys drink merrily. Someone shoves a cup into Oliver's hand, pours him a drink."
oliver,"Two, four, six, eight..."
elliott,That's it? That's all you're gonna tell me?
oliver,I'm gonna meet her at her hotel again. You happy?
elliott,"Yeah, I'm very happy. Are you happy? Oliver drops his books on the counter to check out."
oliver, Here's eight... Turns to Elliot.
oliver,"We haven't actually had a conversation yet, so, you know..."
elliott,You're thinking about her all the time.
oliver,And you know that because?
elliott,"Because you're not talking about it. I know you. There's a pause, then the truth."
oliver,It's true. It's embarrassing. I'm 38 and falling for a girl again...
young oliver,Where's Pop?
georgia,At the museum.
young oliver,"Is something wrong with you guys? Georgia is startled, she hides her feelings with humor."
georgia,"What're you, in the FBI?"
young oliver,No.
georgia,The CIA?
young oliver,No.
georgia,KGB?  BMW? Oliver sits silently.
georgia,"There is nothing wrong with me and Pop. Georgia's mask breaks revealing sadness. Oliver can see it, she can see he sees it. Georgia gets up and leads Oliver out of the room."
georgia,"When you feel bad, you go into a room and scream - loud as you want, for a minute or two, then it's out of you. It's called catharsis. She opens the door, pushes him inside, and closes the door."
oliver,"I don't feel like screaming... Georgia, never ruffled."
georgia,You will...
oliver,What the fuck is that?
elliott,"L-E-IT, Elliot"
oliver,"Well, that's ridiculous."
elliott,I know!  You're not very supportive.
oliver,"Well, its just copying something someone did, like, 30 years ago in the Bronx."
elliott,"Well yeah. I'm part of a tradition of civil disobedience, something bigger than myself. Oliver can't believe Elliott said that."
oliver,How does it work?
elliott,"Shake it, you have to shake it. Oliver shakes it awkwardly, then sprays across the wall:"
elliott,What was that?
oliver,"Historical consciousness... you know, something bigger than myself. Elliott scoffs."
oliver,Let's do it again. Elliott drives off. Oliver's coming to life.
anna,"He's sweet. He misses your Dad. She stops. Gets up, nervous, and walks past Oliver into the next room. Oliver follows her in. They pause uncomfortably, Anna suddenly leans in and kisses him. Before it goes to far..."
oliver,"Maybe we, we could, um, just talk for a second."
anna,"Right. They awkwardly break apart. Anna goes to a chair, Oliver follows. While nothing has really been expressed between the two, Anna seems to understand the problem."
anna,"Well, my name is Anna. You're worried you can't trust me because you don't know who I am. I get it. That makes sense to me. She falters, looks at him vulnerably. Oliver abruptly kisses her. She pushes back. They pause. She traces his brow slowly with her index finger, the way she did their first night."
georgia,"Oliver, stop it."
oliver,This music's old.
georgia,"It's black, black music is the deepest cause they suffered the most, them and the Jews. Oliver plops down on the bed, listening to her."
georgia,In my next life I'm gonna marry a good hot blooded Jew - someone full of emotion.
oliver,"I'm Jewish right? Georgia comes and sits with him, caresses his hair as she talks with him."
georgia,You're turning into a wonderful driver. Oliver's proud.
security guard,Excuse me Mrs. Fields....
georgia,What? You're not allowed to interact with the art?
security guard,It's just that...
oliver,"C'mon. Still embarrassed, Oliver takes Georgia's hand and walks her away from the guard."
georgia,You too? You like being a good citizen?
oliver,No.
anna,Can you toss me my camisole. Oliver throws a sweater.
oliver,Camisole? Anna laughs.
anna,You don't know what a camisole is?
oliver,I was brought up by these animals and they didn't like questions. They're both smiling now.
oliver,They were very frowned upon. So I had to guess. Anna takes this in.
anna,You can ask me anything.
oliver,Anything? CUT TO: Oliver and Anna at the window.
oliver,What's out there? She points.
anna,That's a tree.
oliver,Yeah.
anna,And cars.
oliver,Uh-huh.
anna,Another building like this one.
oliver,Right.
anna,People in the building like us. Half of them think things will never work out. The other half believe in magic. It's like a war between them. Oliver smiles. He moves away from the window.
oliver,How do you know so much about people?
anna,"Oh. Well, you have to learn how to read their faces. She climbs onto his lap, straddles him."
anna,"For example... here is mad. Anna passes her hand across her face, and she's ""mad""."
anna,"Happy... Her hand passes again and she's ""happy""."
anna,Sometimes its just nothing.
oliver,Oh yeah? She points at her blank face.
anna,"This is nothing... And they are good at looking one way and being another way. Her playfulness is very meaningful to Oliver, he's in love."
oliver,"Okay, open your eyes... HIGH ANGLE on huge trucks and traffic racing just beneath Oliver and Anna's feet under the overpass. The trucks lay on their horns as they pass, scaring and thrilling them. MOMENTS LATER: they walk alongside the LA river together, arm in arm, happy. The intimate conversation continues in voice over."
arthur subtitle,She's unlike any girl I've ever met.
oliver,Someone flashy walks into your life and you're just gonna fall for it?
arthur subtitle,Are we married yet?
oliver,"No, uh, it doesn't work like that. There are other steps, it's complicated. They look at each other a beat and then walk on together."
arthur subtitle,I hope this feeling lasts.
hal,What happened with Michelle?
oliver,You know... I don't know.
hal,She seemed great.
oliver,She was great.
hal,"Maybe you should take out a personal ad, where you explain your situation?"
oliver,My situation?
hal,"Yeah, I mean, you want to be in a relationship but you can't stay in one."
oliver,That's your fatherly advice? Personal ads?
hal,"Well, a lot of people use them... I did."
oliver,What?
hal,"If Andy wasn't going to be monogamous, why should I be?"
oliver,"Jesus, Pop."
hal,Jesus yourself.
hal,"Hello house  Hello Hal. Andy holds Arthur. Hal and Arthur kiss. They've clearly missed each other. JUMP CUTS: Oliver takes bottles of pills and syrups and inhalers out of a Sav-On bag. He makes a chart of the medicine, the dosage, and puts the pills in a dish. It's emotional job for him."
hal,"Oh God, what have you got this time?"
andy,It's a green caterpillar.
hal,"No, no, no, you don't have a green caterpillar."
andy,Oh yeah I do.
hal,"Oh my God. Gross! Oh, Jesus..."
hal,"Hey, you going?"
andy,"Yeah, Michael's in town."
hal,Oh. Right. Andy waves goodbye and leaves. Hal is sad but covering it up. He catches Oliver watching.
oliver,I thought he was your boyfriend?
hal,"Well, at least I'm the number one boyfriend. Hal grimaces in pain, doubles over."
oliver,Pop.
hal,"Oh, my stomach."
oliver,"Alright, come on. Come on. Oliver tries to clear the couch of books and dogs for Hal to sit down."
oliver,"Arthur, down."
hal,"Well, let's say, when you were little, you always dreamed of some day getting a lion? Oliver eases Hal down onto the couch."
hal,And you wait and you wait and you wait and you wait and the lion doesn't come. Then along comes a giraffe. Oliver helps Hal get his feet up.
hal,You can be alone or you can be with the giraffe.
oliver,I'd wait for the lion. Oliver grabs the oxygen tubes and puts them on Hal's face.
hal,That's why I worry about you. Hal looks at Oliver with love and concern.
hal,You want me to be with someone like me. I like Andy cause he's not like me... he's fun.
oliver,"Hey, what did you get? She puts the cover of Liv Ullman's ""Changing"" over her face - Ullman's face on the cover becomes Anna's."
anna,And I found this crazy book. She holds an old copy of THE JOY OF SEX in front of her face.
oliver,That's kind of a classic American thing. Anna opens the book to a large drawing of a couple having sex.
anna,Maybe we can figure out some classic American things to do. Oliver takes the book and flips through the pages.
oliver,"Yeah, Like page 75?"
anna,Uh-huh.
oliver,"Or 75 all the way through, through"
oliver,Veronica Lake.
anna,Oh I love her.
oliver,She was a pin-up model and a film star... Success was short-lived... series of broken marriages... She struggled with mental illness and alcoholism. She died of hepatitis
anna,"All these actor stories end sad. I can tell you that already. It's not a good life. Oliver closes the book, they share a look, and something vulnerable. Anna changes the mood, pulls out The Joy Of Sex, skips through the pages as she talks."
anna,No.
oliver,Yeah.
anna,Really?
oliver,"It's really good. JUMP CUT: They're sitting on milk crates by the truck, ready to take their first bite, Anna dives in un-selfconsciously, we're not sure what she thinks."
oliver,What do you think?
anna,It's so good. Oliver's so relieved.
oliver,"It's good? Oh, I wasn't sure you'd like it."
anna,Why?
oliver,You're an actress and staying in that fancy hotel. Anna can barely swallow her huge bite...
anna,I like this place.
anna,I used to love hotels. But now I'm always in a new apartment or... in another hotel somewhere.
oliver,How do you keep hold of friends... or boyfriends?
anna,It makes it very easy to end up alone - to leave people.
oliver,"You can stay in the same place and still find ways to leave people. She reaches up with her hand, their fingers intertwine."
anna,You are like that? Its what you do? Oliver nods yes. They know each other much better than either one knew.
anna,So we are the same?
oliver,"Yeah, I guess so. The look to each other.  CUT TO PAST"
oliver,Pop?
hal,"Oh, did I wake you? Yeah.  And now that you're here, uh, would you please put those up there?"
oliver,What are you--? Pop. What?
hal,I'm reorganizing.
oliver,Prednisone makes you crazy.
hal,I'm just not sleepy. I feel great.
hal,"As soon as I finish these papers. Right, papers?  Right, Hal. As soon as you're done, you can rest. Oliver can only sit and worry.  CUT TO PRESENT"
anna,What?
oliver,"Nothing, you're pretty."
anna,No...
oliver,Yeah.
anna,"Jewish girls are not pretty. They can be ""interesting"", or cute, but not pretty."
oliver,You're kidding right?
anna,That's what my mom told me.
oliver,"She did not. Anna laughs. As Anna continues to explain, the sound begins to fade down..."
anna,"No, you're right, this girl at school told me that. And I went home and my mom said, `Anna, who told you that? And Oliver's narration fades in over them walking..."
oliver,Yeah. Right.  CUT TO:
oliver,"Here, Pop."
hal,"Oh, God."
oliver,"I know, I know. Come on. Hal begins taking his many pills, with each one he pings his glass with a teaspoon as he swallows. The room is cluttered with books. Oliver picks up a toppling pile of files from a paper-filled side table."
hal,"Hey, no, no, no. That's the Gay Pride Day stuff. Just leave those."
oliver,Alright. Oliver begins to neaten a messy pile of books on top of a chair.
hal,And that's for gay book club. You better leave those too.
oliver,But what about this chair? Is it gay?
hal,"The chair's not gay. Obviously. Hal gets up and walks to the kitchen, his oxygen cannon cord is attached to the pump behind him, stopping him short."
oliver,"Pop, Pop, the cord won't go that far."
hal,"Oh, to hell with it. Hal pulls off the oxygen and keeps walking, frail but determined. Andy enters with a large pilates ball."
hal,"Oh, hey what's that?"
andy,"Now that you're out of the hospital, you'll have to exercise, get you back into shape. Oliver can't believe it."
hal,That's a great idea.
andy,"Okay, let's try it. I'll, I'll show you how. Hal's still heading to the sink."
hal,"Yeah, later on, I'm gonna make myself some tea."
andy,"Okay, I'll clean it up. It's a little - yech. Andy walks out, Hal pours water into a kettle, in front of him on the window sill is the same vase from the first scene of the film, with some dead daisies in it."
hal,Your mother's vase needs some flowers. Oliver looks at them frustrated and uneasy...
oliver,"Pop, you just got out of the hospital, you should take it easy."
oliver,"You need to tell Andy that you're... not well. Hal, continues on, avoiding looking at Oliver."
hal,"You'll tell him, won't you? Oliver's flabbergasted, but his dad's vulnerability is clear to him."
oliver,Me?
hal,Please?
oliver,"Hey. Oliver approaches seriously, this makes Andy nervous, he stops his workout. Oliver tries to find his words."
andy,You know that I tried to have sex with women?
oliver,Yeah?
andy,"Yeah. I wanted you to know I tried, it just, it didn't work."
oliver,"Hey, I don't have a problem with gay guys."
andy,Have you ever had sex with a man?
oliver,No.
andy,"I heard that if a man hasn't had sex with another man, he's always afraid of gay men. You know, they're a threat. Oliver's blown away by the logic."
oliver,I don't know Andy.
andy,"I didn't want you to feel threatened, I don't want to have sex with you. What I do, most people wouldn't even call it sex. Andy's relieved he got this off his chest, all tension is relieved for him, Oliver is just confused."
oliver,"Okay, okay."
andy,Hey... Andy gives Oliver a big sweaty hug. Oliver leaves.
oliver,I couldn't tell him.
hal,That's okay.
oliver,No it's not. You can't hide this from him. He loves you.
hal,"For someone with so much relationship advice, you seem awfully alone. Oliver, angry but at a loss for words, takes the flower vase and leaves, Arthur follows."
oliver,"Just act natural. When he's not looking, we'll make a run for it, okay?  CUT TO PRESENT"
anna,"Don't, don't. It keeps ringing."
anna,It's my dad. They both watch the phone as it rings and stops.
oliver,"He's that bad? She picks up the phone, and gestures for Oliver to pick up the line next to him."
anna," Honey? She gestures again, Oliver picks up the phone on his side of the bed. Anna turns away, he can only see her back across the bed. He turns away too."
oliver,Oui? Anna continues to talk in a different voice.
anna,"C'est toi, cheri?"
oliver,Oui Papa.
anna,You never call me back.
anna,"You know, I can't stop thinking about, you know, about it. Doing it."
oliver,Doing what?
anna,"Killing myself. You are the only one I can tell that to. Oliver breaks role, turns around looks at her."
oliver,"You should tell mom about that, not me. She just looks at him. Back into phone."
anna,"You are my girl. They hang up. She's embarrassed, she lightens the mood to get out of this intimacy."
anna,Now I have to kill you.
oliver,Just as it was going so well.
anna,"I know. I'm sorry. She tosses a pillow over his face and pretends to shoot him twice. She pulls the pillow back tentatively, he's smiling."
oliver,Hey Anna?
anna,Hey Oliver?
oliver,How do you feel about vandalism? It's the last question she thought he'd ask. She's amused.
anna,I don't know. Pretty okay.
elliott,"Oliver, don't write any of that serious stuff, okay? Just write something funny. Girls like funny."
shauna,"You know what? Here, give me Arthur. We'll just stay here and get arrested. You know, that's good. Oliver leaves Arthur with her, and Anna and Elliott and him head off to the billboard. They climb it's structure, it's high and a bit scary. On the top is a gang plank looking over the city. Anna is happy she came. Elliott goes to paint the back side of the billboard. Oliver meets up with Anna, over looking the city."
oliver,You okay?
anna,Yeah. I'm gonna stay here with my new friend .
oliver,Okay. Oliver walks out and writes big letters across the billboard.
anna,C'est beau ici.
oliver,"Yeah. He comes to her, wanting to get beyond the romance somehow."
oliver,I'm trying to impress you.
anna," Really? She walks to him and puts her hands around his head, somehow it's more intimate and vulnerable now."
anna,It's working. They kiss. MOMENTS LATER. They're at the bottom of the ladder. They all run back to their car.
oliver,"Arthur, Arthur. I'm sorry. We see the old man's face, it's not Hal, but it the resemblance hits Oliver too. The man is struggling with his hotel key card."
old man,Oh. No problem. No problem. What's with this card?
old man,Thank you. He disappears. Oliver looks overwhelmed by this ghost. Anna senses what's happened. She leads Oliver to their room.
anna,He looked like your dad?
oliver,"Yeah. She wants to take care of him, she lays him back on the bed, helps him take his coat off, she's sitting on him, caressing him - Oliver is overwhelmed by memory."
oliver,"Somewhere along the line, he stopped admitting to himself that he was sick."
hal,"Oliver, this is Blake. He's a wonderful man. CU of the small round registration tattoos on Hal's chest"
hal,Look. I finally got a tattoo. Registration purposes of course.  CUT BACK TO PRESENT
anna,Good for him.
oliver,He had a lot of parties.
hal,"Well, glad you could make it."
oliver,I thought I was making dinner?
hal,It's movie night. Oliver and Hal make their way through a crowd of Hal's gay friends. They're in party mode.
party guest,"Hal, you look wonderful."
hal,"Oh, I'm turning the corner on this thing. We loose Hal and Oliver in the group..."
hal,Well...
oliver,You have stage 4 cancer?
hal,It's not as bad as it sounds.
hal,That's not what it means.
oliver,What does it mean?
hal,"It just means it's been through 3 other stages. Oliver doesn't know what to say, he looks through the door at all of Hal's friends -- happy, laughing, partying. He looks back at Hal, ready to fight him more, but for the first time we can see fear and doubt in Hal's face."
oliver,What movie are we watching?
hal,"""The Life of Harvey Milk."" He was the first openly gay politician..."
oliver,Yeah I know who Harvey Milk is.
hal,"Good, good."
hal,"Eventually Jesus grew old. He could no longer walk far and he could no longer preach in a loud voice. One day he announced to his apostles that he was departing. The three disciples prayed with him, gave him water, bathed and fed him. After gasping for breath for several days, one morning, just as dawn came, Jesus passed away."
oliver,You re-wrote Jesus' death? They all laugh.
hal,"It was so violent, we need new stories. Oliver goes over and kisses Hal on the head."
anna,"Stay here. She starts to close the door, Arthur scratches, she tries again, he scratches. She opens the door, Arthur trots out into the hallway - Anna catches up with him."
oliver,Anna?
anna,"I couldn't sleep, I wanted to walk around... Oliver's petting Arthur. He's confused and hurt."
anna,You've lost so much. What if I can't make up for that?
oliver,"If this is too much, then we should just stop. Oliver gets up and starts to leave, Anna's surprised. She catches up with him puts her arms around him from behind."
anna,"Wait, wait. She forces him to stay there."
anna,"I don't want to stop. They hold this pose in silence for a beat, then, surprisingly, he hoists her over his shoulder, and carries her back to their room. She laughs, they've made it past this trouble."
andy,"Ready? Andy has a set-up of large fireworks ready to go, Hal and twelve friends stand by, Oliver's behind."
oliver,No!
hal,Again!
everyone,Arthur! Arthur... Arthur...
anna,"Ah, you're awake! Arthur says it's time to get up, he says he has the day off."
oliver,He talks to you too?
anna,Yeah.
oliver,Your English is not so perfect. And he said ten minutes.
oliver,You okay?  You did really well.
elliott,"Yeah, I can't believe that was your first time."
oliver," You watching all the humans going around and around. The manager of the rink suddenly arrives, upset."
manager,Excuse me. There's no dogs allowed in the building. You need to remove him from the premises please.
oliver,"If I leave him on his own, he loses all control."
manager,I'm sorry. There's no dogs allowed in the building.
oliver,"Yeah, but if I leave him in the car, he cries, he howls. I can't leave him in the car."
manager,I don't know what she's saying but I don't like it.
oliver,"She is just talking in French. She's saying it's OK, it is such a small dog."
manager,You need to remove the dog from the premises or I'm going to have to call the authorities.
oliver,You're gonna call the authorities?
anna,Dans ce pays! On ne peut pas amener un chien. On peut rien faire. Mais c'est con...
oliver,"Sorry, excuse us, sorry. They enter Anna's door."
oliver,He shouldn't do this to you. The phone in the next room keeps ringing. He awkwardly skates to it and unplugs it. He returns.
anna,"Even if we don't answer, he's still in here .I go somewhere else, he's still here. Oliver can relate."
oliver,Your leaving soon?
anna,Yeah.
oliver,I think you should come to my house and move in with me.
anna,Would you want a strange girl like me?
oliver,"Yeah, a lot. She's very moved."
anna,Do you cook?
oliver,"Yes . She laughs. She almost cries as she thinks this over. She skates to him, puts her arms around him."
anna,I would love that. They kiss.
oliver,But now I'm going to have to kill you for sure now.
anna,Why?
oliver,"Cause I'm falling in love with you. The sound in the room fades down, Oliver's narration fades in over the shot of them embracing in their skates."
oliver,Next one.
hal,"Lord. With each swallow he pings a glass with a fork. Hal opens a letter from a gay rights organization, he hands Oliver the rainbow sticker we just saw."
oliver,"Yeah, everyone knows that, here. He gives Hal another pill, another reluctant difficult swallow, another ping."
hal,No they don't.
oliver,Everyone knows about that Pop.
hal,"Don't be ridiculous. Hal's hiding something, he doesn't look Oliver in the eyes when he asks..."
hal,"Did you know, about me? Oliver shakes his head no."
oliver,"No, I just thought you and mom weren't in love."
hal,We loved each other.
oliver,But you were gay that whole time.
hal,I learned how not to be.
oliver,For 44 years?
hal,"I knew I was gay, though, at dinner parties I was looking at the husbands not the wives."
oliver,What about sex? You guys had sex?
hal,"She didn't think I was the greatest lover, but we made do. Look, I liked my life, the museum, our house, that's what I wanted."
oliver,"And mom? You wanted mom too right? Frustrated and angry, Oliver takes the pill tray into the kitchen, leaving Hal behind."
hal,"Yes, stop that."
hal,She proposed to me you know. This draws Oliver back into the room.
hal,"I said - look I love you and we're great buddies but you know what I am. And then she says, that doesn't matter. I'll fix that. Oliver's never heard this part of the story before."
hal,Andy's moving in.
oliver,Yeah? Is that a good idea? Hal hugs Oliver.
hal,Just be happy about it. Oliver can't just be happy about it.
oliver,"This is the idea, is that it's the history of sadness. Oliver spreads out an impossible long CD panel design."
oliver,"Here, this could be your... The panels go on and on."
oliver,"Your gonna need a big CD box. JUMP CUT: Later, Oliver's still trying to talk the band into his idea. Four billion years ago, Earth begins. And the idea is that sadness has not been created yet. JUMP CUT: Oliver and the RECORD COMPANY REP now alone."
oliver,I'm sorry.
oliver,"Well, that went well."
arthur subtitle,Are we married yet?
oliver,Come on Arthur.
oliver,This is the living room. He leads her into the dining room.
oliver,Dining room. Oliver points to a photo of his parents when they were in their 50's.
oliver,"There are my parents. My mom. Hal, Georgia, this is Anna - Anna - Hal, Georgia. Anna's overwhelmed feeling increases, she continues to try to roll with it."
anna,Hello.
oliver,These're the stairs.
anna,Yeah?
oliver,They go up.
oliver,I emptied these for you. I'll get your case.
oliver,"Are you okay? She want's to be, she hides it all by initiating sex with him, physical and fast."
anna,You OK?
oliver,Are you?
anne,"I couldn't sleep, I didn't want to bug you. Oliver can't overcome his mistrust of her and the whole situation. She tries to defend herself, honest and vulnerable."
anna,"I was nervous, and excited. I kept thinking, maybe I'm not so lost."
oliver,Why were you crying yesterday? They're miles apart.
anna,You okay?
oliver,Yeah.
anna,You seem so unhappy with me.
oliver,Well are you happy here?
anna,"Maybe I'm not perfect at it. I don't really know what I'm doing... but I want to be here. He's silent, distant, confused. She's hurt by his silence and mistrust and leaves."
oliver,I don't know Anna. I don't think this is what I am supposed to feel like. Anna looks crushed and surprised.
anna,Okay. I will go back to New York then. She gets up to go.
hal,Have I done something wrong?
hal,I see.
hal,You did an excellent job Dr. Long. Thank you... for... For coming to the party. Oliver's devastated.
hal,"You always wanted to hold my hand when you were little. I couldn't, you know. I was afraid it would look funny. I wanted to be close, you know and my father certainly was never close with me. God, I hope I wasn't like that."
oliver,I can barely remember you from when I was little.
hal,I guess I was at work.
fancy woman,"Oh! Georgia smiles at her, casually unnerving. Oliver pulls her away."
oliver,Let's go home. CUT TO: Oliver and Georgia heading away through the gallery.
georgia,What about your father? What will he possibly do without us?
older woman,Georgia? You leaving?
georgia,"Yes Mary, it's an emergency, Oliver's appendix has ruptured."
older woman,Oh dear. They look at Oliver who's mortified.
georgia,He's a very composed child.
oliver,Let's go. Oliver pulls her away before she starts any more trouble.
georgia,"Aha. The infamous left. Up a new street, they arrive at the next stop."
georgia,And? Oliver points left.
georgia,"Left again. Going in circles. I like it. Irreverent but heavy, they drive on."
arthur subtitle,"We knew it wouldn't work even before we met her. Oliver get's this more than ever. Something changes inside of him, he picks up his cel phone and dials."
oliver,Anna? Where where you?
oliver,Hey.
elliott,Hey.
elliott,Alright.
oliver,"Okay? Thanks. Elliott closes the door. Oliver heads back to his car and Arthur's howling begins. It's an incredibly sad and desperate howl. Oliver gets to his car, the howling doesn't stop, Oliver can't ignore it. Oliver get's out of the car, heads back to house to get Arthur."
andy,"He remembers me. It's true, Oliver's surprised."
oliver,"Hey. Look I'm so sorry... But I'm, I'm at your front door. I'm in New York. Anna, still in bed, sits up and feels something."
oliver,"You, you're in LA? Anna laughs, but is touched."
anna,"Yeah, but I didn't leave."
oliver,Fuck. I'm in your building. Anna laughs.
anna,There is a hide-a-key behind it.
oliver,"Okay, I'm inside. Wow, there's like nothing here."
anna,No. Oliver moves forward into the kitchen.
anna,Why do you leave everyone? Why did you let me go? Oliver thinks for a moment.
hal,Isn't Juan's hair wonderful.
juan,Thanks. I use this great mousse.
hal,Well it's terrific.
juan,Do you wanna try some? Hal turns shy and young.
hal,"Oh, no."
juan,Just a little bit?
hal,I don't think so.
juan,Come on. Just try a little bit. It'll be fun.
juan,Yeah.
hal,How do you do it?
juan,"Okay, I'm going to show you how. Juan steps away and grabs his mousse, puts a little in his hand and sits back down on Hal's bed. He begins to spread it gently through wisps of Hal's white hair. Oliver watches Hal close his eyes, and deeply enjoy this simple affection and camaraderie with another gay man."
juan,There.
hal,Is that it? Hal looks into camera which is Oliver's POV.
hal,"How do I look? Oliver's filled with love, happiness, regret."
oliver,Great. You look great.
juan,"Oliver. He's gone. Oliver gets up. He can now see to the hospital bed, Hal's lifeless profile. Oliver is lost. Oliver goes to Hal, puts his head on his chest and cries."
oliver,Hey.
andy,Hey.
oliver,"Arthur... Oliver picks him up, he gets all of Arthur's stuff, he's a little cold to Andy."
oliver,Thank you... Thanks.
andy,"It's cause I'm gay, isn't it? Oliver stops and looks back."
oliver,What?
andy,"You never called or came to see me? Oliver falters, not know how to say it, then..."
oliver,"No. No, it's because my father loved you so much. This hits Andy hard. Oliver turns to leave but can't. He turns back, goes to Andy and they hug."
oliver,"Arthur... hey. Hey, how've you been?"
oliver,"Hey. She's a bit tentative, but she's here and happy."
anna,Hey.
oliver,"Come in, come in. Arthur runs up and Anna bends down to greet him. They missed each other. Anna walks in and Oliver follows."
anna,The living room. She heads to the dinning room.
anna,"Dining room... Oliver laughs nervously. In the dining room, Hal's old boxes are still stacked along the walls. Oliver leans forward and pulls something out of a box. She looks at a personal ad application, with the picture of Hal in the open jean jacket we saw at the beginning of the film."
anna,Oh. Crazy picture...
oliver,Yeah.
anna,Can I read it?
oliver,Sure.
anna,I'm looking for sex with the hope it turns into friendship or a relationship. But I don't insist on monogamy.
various locations,"We see REPEAT SHOTS of Hal, and in every shot he's looking at camera. Hal telling Oliver he's gay, Hal napping with Andy and waving at Oliver, Hal after Juan put in his hair mousse looking at Oliver, Hal showing Oliver his radiation tatoo...  ANNA  And in addition to art, I like houses, gardens, parties, and walking with my Jack Russell. I'm 5'11"", 160 pounds. I'm trim, gray hair, blue eyes, hairy cheest.  CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT"
oliver,Chest...
oliver,I like giving and getting rubdowns and then going into mutual soft stuff. They both smile.
anna,"I have a nice house with food, drinks, friends and me. If you are willing to try an older guy, let's meet and see what happens. She looks at the photo again."
anna,"He didn't give up. They look at each other, more vulnerable and willing than we've seen them."
oliver,What happens now?
anna,I don't know.
oliver,"How does that work? They look at each other, they smile."
