Speaker,Dialogue
rev 1st draft,"July 30, 1986"
sweet coed, I don't know what else to say!
sweet coed,"Something about myself? Oh, Gee...  Well, I want to work with handicapped children... My parents are my best Friends... Next semester I start convent school, and I... fuck on the first date."
chaz's voice,"Whoo! Outrageous woman! Nikki, you are my kind o' gal!"
chaz's voice,"C'mon, Kit, how about you?"
chaz's voice,"C'mon , Arch? Skip?"
arch," Yeah, sure... I fuck on the first date..."
chaz's voice," Yeah, Kit, where is he?"
kit,"Oh, c'mon, Chaz, give me some room, will you?"
nikki, Well? INT. VOLVO WAGON IN MOTION - MAIN HIGHWAY - DAY
rob," Here'll be fine, thanks..."
rob," Thanks... for the lift, I mean..."
suburban lady," It was a real lift for me, too, hon."
clara," The rooms are all in order, double- and triple-checked, and I'm on my way..."
muffy,Shit.
clara's voice,Need any help down there?
muffy," No, Clara, thanks. Just trying some last minute straightening down here... god, I don't think I've ever worked so hard in my life...!"
clara,"Sure you don't want me to stay? There's nobody gonna be around here to help till first ferry back Monday, y'know..."
muffy," Nope, you're a peach, Clara. But this one's mine. I told my father I'd do it, and I will. My way. I don't want him to have any excuses."
clara," All right, then. Have a nice party."
muffy, Nice? It has to be better than nice... it's gotta be bloody unforgettable!
clara,Good luck.
chaz,Here she comes...
nan, Hi... is this the ferry to the St. John house?
nan,"Oh, thank goodness ! I didn't know if I was on the right road..."
nan,Nan Youngblood.
nikki, Planning on staying a while?
nan," Oh, no... just some work for finals, when we get back... you don't know how far behind I am..."
arch,"Hi. Arch Cummings . I've seen you around. Jewett Hall, right?"
chaz,Chaz Vyshinsky. You got great legs.
nikki," Chaz, Arch already has her bag."
nan," Well, I only met Muffy this term in Drama Society . I volunteered to do their costumes... I like to sew... Did you see her in Ghosts? She's so talented. She was wonderful!"
skip," Congratulations, on finding your way."
ferryman, Stand clear!
nikki," This is it? No going back? Trapped for days on an island where men are men, and women oughta know better?"
arch," Try to control yourself, Sister O'Toole."
nikki, You could tie me in chains...
chaz," Your fly's open, and your Hostess Twinkie's hanging out..."
buck,Sh -i-i-t...
ferryman,Come on if you're coming.
kit, Excuse me. But we're still waiting for somebody --
ferryman, It's Friday. My last run of the week. I don't get paid overtime. KIT But you've got to wait. They said it's the only way over. If he misses this...
harvey,Wait up!
rob, Rob Ferris...
harvey," Hi! Harvey 'Hal' Edison, Jr., but please call me Hal. Only my folks call me Harve... and I can't stand it. Boy, this sure is a pretty spot."
chaz,You're friends with... Muffy St. John?
harvey, Sure am. We sit together in Econ 345. I let her copy my marginal utility curves.
nikki,I get it. That's a joke. Preppy Skip adds his greeting.
skip, Harve.
harvey," Springsteen, he's still the Boss!"
ferryman," Ok, c'mon, I don't have all day."
harvey, YOU all buddies?
nikki,Except for Skip and Nan. Them we just met.
kit, But we will be.
chaz," Watch what you say around him, though. He's Muffy's cousin."
harvey, No kiddin'?
skip,"Distant. Over the horizon. Otherwise, I wouldn't be invited...  Old money never mixes family with friends."
nikki,This is true. For as long as I've known her.
kit, To keep her friends.
arch," Hey, what's this...?"
skip,You up for a game of stretch?
chaz, Your fly's open.
skip,Eat it.
chaz," Ok, so don't believe me."
rob, We're off!
skip,"First round, the champ!"
harvey,"Y'know what I find amazin'? Muffy's her real name. I mean, I'm Harvey, but they call me Hal, so I thought, 'Muffy', it must stand for something... Muffin?"
nikki,"Muffers, Moffo, Muff-child , Muffin' stuff, the Muffster..."
harvey, I bet you're her oldest friend.
nikki," Actually, she's three months older than I am."
harvey,You know what I mean.
nikki,Harvey... are you planning a career in politics when you grow up?
harvey,I've given it some thought. Why?
nikki,"Oh, just a hunch."
harvey,"First, though, I'm hopin' to interview with her daddy's company, Southern Regional Sales, next year before graduation... Y'know, he's worth more'n 50 mill over the counter!"
skip," Go for it, big fella."
chaz,"fastens onto Nan, immersed in one of her books. He carries his own."
chaz, Whatcha readin'?
nan,"Milton. Paradise Lost. For Professor Russo's course on the English epic... It's a shame. It's a dying form. Not too many people read it nowadays, even in college. What's yours?"
chaz, Suck and fuck.
rob,"You don't want me to hitch, you want me to buy a car. OK, but I'm a state university boy, I don't have the perks like some of you private college kids do."
kit,"Oh, c'mon, don't pull that."
rob,Kit...
arch's voice," Hey, I'm really not interested anymore --"
skip,"C'mon, just one more"
arch,"I said, enough's enough--"
skip,"One more try, double or nothing."
arch," C'mon, give it a fuckin' rest!"
skip," Oh, fuck."
skip,"Nan screams. Skip stumbles, teetering there at the edge of the ferry. Rob and Chaz leap to their feet. The ferrymen both look up in disbelief. Arch steps forward to help. But Skip, weaving, topples and splashes overboard. He goes under."
arch," I'll get him, I'll get him!"
skip's voice,"Hi, this what you're looking for?"
arch,"We got 'em! Whoo-ee, did we nail 'em! CHAZ  April Fools... you crazy jerks. You crazy motherfuckin' jerks... somebody could've gotten hurt out there!"
buck, SH-I-I-I-T
nikki,You maniacs... you almost gave us a heart attack!
arch," Well, at least we don't go in for this your-shoelaceis-untied crap!"
rob, I owe you one.
skip, How's it goin' out there?
buck,That was great!
skip,I was really counting on these other turkeys to save my ass.
chaz,"Oh, too bad."
skip,Sorry about that.
ferryman," Ok, c'mon, get out."
ferryman,"Buck, look out--"
rob," Oh, shit..."
ferryman,Buck!
kit," Oh, god! EXT. DOCK - ISLAND - DAY"
ferryman,Get away from him!
buck,They did it... them!
ferryman, Easy Buck... it's OK... OK... There's time for Later... easy...
constable potter," Get him to the hospital, Cal! Take my boat!"
constable potter,All right... Let's have it. INT. MUFFY'S PASSENGER VAN - DAY
muffy,What's going on? Sam... what's wrong?
constable potter, Tricks. Pranks. Better ask your friends... Buck's been hurt. 'Cal just took him on over to the mainland. Just lucky I was here...
muffy,"No, he's in Sutton Place. Why?"
constable potter,"No word from him, or anybody else?"
muffy, No...
constable potter,Just like I thought. . Burned out. Worthless...
muffy,"We keep all the keys on the board in the kitchen, but I think there's an extra one underneath the cushion there. She points to the boat seat. Potter is much obliged."
constable potter," I'm glad you're stuck here, all o' you. If there's anvthin' else, or anything happens to Buck... I want to know where to find you."
skip,These goddamn windows!
skip,They've never been fixed...
kit,"Look, Skip, it wasn't your fault. It was an accident. You didn't know."
skip, Sure.
rob," What a way to start a weekend, huh."
skip,Muffy. Nothing bad ever happens to her.
muffy,"Well, there's an awful lot to be done with this place."
arch,You sound as if you own it.
muffy,"I will, if all goes well. Next month when I turn 21. It's my first- stage inheritance."
harvey, First stage? What's your second?
nikki," Texas. You might be talking to your future boss, Harve."
chaz,"Mom, I am home!"
arch,"Yeah, I could get real used to this."
muffy,We used to spend our summers here before my mother died.  This is a very special place to me.
nan,It's like a dream. NIKKI On a clear day you can see the Kennedys.
chaz's voice," Wow, look at this...!"
chaz, Look! Our very own place settings... with our very own place cards -- with Ken or Barbie! Outasight!
nan, Just like in Agatha Cristie.
arch, And sporks...
harvey, Sporks?
arch,"And napkins with little Hallmark bunnies! Gee, Muff, you really spared no expense."
muffy, Why not? How do you think father made all his money?
nikki, The old-fashioned way. He inherited it.
nan, I used to have all her outfits.
chaz,"Don't anybody move! Chaz jumps back from the table, whipping out his videocam to record the moment, and panning them all at  .their respective places."
nikki,"...if only the choices weren't so limited. God, I'm so ready for a change. Any kind of change."
muffy,"Well, you know, everything they say about older men? It's true."
kit,Muffy!
nikki,Like how much older are we talking about? Twenty-six?
muffy,Add about thirty years.
nikki,"I don't believe you, St. John!"
kit, I don't want to hear about this.
nikki,Come on! MUFFY It was only a weekend. It's over now.  I was curious.
kit,He wasn't married?
muffy, How should I know?
muffy,It was quite a weekend.
nikki,Come to daddy.
nikki,"Come sit on daddy's knee, little girl..."
kit,"My goodness, daddy, what big  ...what big... teeth you have."
all,"The better to eat you with, my dear."
skip," The poor boy can say, ""Fuck you, Dad. I'm my own person."" What is his father going to do? Kick him out of the house? Disinherit him? His life won't have changed that much. He's got nothing to lose."
nan,His father's love.
skip,"That's already been lost. Died a long, long time ago."
nan, Look at how young we all are. How young and foolish and innocent and stupid...
arch,"Please, God, let it be ding dongs."
nikki,St. John hospitality taken to the extreme.
harvey,I think it's real friendly. Makes me feel right at home.
kit,How friendly will we feel once we've finished with those beans?
nan,You guys!
kit,"So it's going to be one of those dinners, huh?"
rob,I wonder how Buck is doing?
nan,Do you think we should call or something?
muffy, I'll call later.
kit,I think we should change the subject.
arch,"Well, Harvey's got his job interview all figured out, but what about the rest of us? Anybody know what they're going to be doing come graduation?"
nikki,"Good choice, Arch."
nan,I can't decide. I'd like to go to graduate school in English. I love the sound of our language. But I'm afraid there's not much future in it.
nikki,"I mean, what are you' supposed to do with a liberal arts major anyway?"
muffy,"You fill out a lot of forms, and then some friend of your family gives you a job delivering mail in his corporation... ARCH This is really incredible. Look at us... Here we are... privileged, independent, the hope of the future... and most of us still don't know what we're going to do with our lives!"
kit, Rob knows. He's going to medical school.
rob,Kit...
chaz," Hey, no shit? You got early acceptance?"
rob, We can talk about it some other time.
kit,"Why? You had your meeting with your counselor, didn't you?"
muffy, Kit... I don't think Rob really wants to talk about it in front of everybody.
rob," No, I don't mind."
kit, Why not? We're all friends.
nikki," Well, sorta..."
rob,He said to forget it.
arch,"Oh, shit, him too? That's what my guy said! An' I said, you're kidding! How can anybody be serious about anything when some moron can steal a bomb or push a button and blow the rest of us right into Mad Max. He wasn't impressed."
rob,He's right. That's bullshit on parade.
arch,Well fuck you. It sounded good at the time.
chaz,What is this? Dom Perignon sparkling rose?
harvey,It smells like Ripple.
nikki,"You've outdone yourself again, St. John."
arch,Who was that?
muffy, Skip.
nan, Can I make a toast?
arch,I cherish all the friends I make.
nan," Because... they'll be the friends you cherish most the rest of your life. So, well, here's to us... here's to my life... because I'm very glad to be here, and to be a part of all of you..."
kit,"Muffy, anything you want to add to that?"
muffy,Why me?
nikki,Because you're the hostess.
muffy,"In his ""Life of Johnson"" James Boswell said, ""We cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed. As in filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop which makes it run over; so in a series of kindnesses, there is at last one which makes the heart run over."""
muffy, April Fool. INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY  NIGHT
nan,Goodnight.
muffy,Goodnight.
nikki,"Oh, great. Quarantine."
muffy, Just holler if you need anything.
nikki,Another room.  Muffy...
muffy," Arch is sweet, but he's only got two expressions. Collar up and collar down."
nikki,"I found that out--  I guess what I'm trying to say is... you always seem to get there first... but this time Chaz is mine, OK?"
muffy, What about Hal?
arch,"Hey, all right... ladies, we are qonna have privacy..."
chaz,. Unless Muffy knows something about us we don't.
harvey," Don't tell me you've never thought of me in that way, Muffy. I felt a spark between us the very first moment we laid eyes on each other... in Econ 345. Why, just think of it, Muffy... with my talent and your... money."
harvey," Why just think of it... Muffers, with my raw... driving talent and your..."
chaz, Wrong room.
arch,Jesus...
muffy,Goodnight.
kit,G'night.
kit,Rob?
kit,You still angry with me? About dinner?
rob,No. I'm sorry. I'm not angry with you. I'm just angry.
rob, Ouch! Jesus!
rob,Very funny.
muffy, Arch do you know what time it is?
arch,Um-hmm.
muffy," Goodnight, Arch."
skip,Hello?
skip,Who's there?
rob, Muffy?
muffy's voice, Yes?
rob,You OK?
muffy's voice, Yes... Thank you...
rob," OK... well, goodnight..."
kit, Good morning!
muffy,I... I was hungry...
arch,"Morning! She backs away from him, scurrying up the stairs."
muffy,I... forgot to get dressed...
arch, Where's Skip?
chaz,That depends on what he's on.
nikki,You gotta be kidding...
arch, Nan? What about it?
nan,"Oh, no, thanks.  Besides, I thought I'd wait and see what Muffy wanted to do..."
kit,Rob? What's wrong?
rob,I swear it wasn't this cold yesterday .
kit,Are you giving up?
rob, ...maybe it's crazy--you investing so much energy in me.
kit, I don't know. I'm scared. I don't know if I want what Mom and everybody else expects of me. I don't want to go to law school.
rob, You've got a great mind
kit,...only it's not made up.
rob,Great... Do you realize how perfectly unmatched we are?
kit,It's made up about one thing though.
rob,Yeah? What's that? She looks up and kisses him softly.
rob,"Will you feel the same about me a year from now? Two years, five years from now?"
rob,Skip! You sonofabitch!
rob,Skip... Skip!
arch," Well, how was it?"
rob,Where's Skip? Anybody seen him?
nikki,Who wants to know?
rob,"Goddammit, can't you give me a straight answer!"
kit, We saw him... on a boat... drifting by the pier. He wasn't movinq. He looked dead... unless he was joking...!
chaz,"Well, if it was Skip..."
kit,I saw his face!
rob, Has anybody seen him since last night?
muffy, Something wrong?
arch,Wait! I'll go with you!
chaz,Me too!
arch," Hey, asshole!"
chaz,Wait a minute! Look at this!
chaz,This was Skip's. ARCH What do you think? That guy on the ferry?
rob,I don't know. I don't know what to think.
arch,"I say we go looking for him, him or Skip. One of them's bound to still be around... somewhere."
chaz,You mean split up?
rob,Let's not take any chances. He was... He was pretty big.
arch,No sucker's taken me yet.
nan,"I know why you're avoiding me...  I guess it's your idea of a joke... that's why you invited me. How'd you find out? From one of his preppy 'friends'? Who else have you told?... Who else knows, except the father!"
muffy, I... don't know what you're talking about.
nan,Oh? The tape just got there? You know very well... my abortion!
harvey, Sorry... I was just checkin' to make sure everybody was all right.
nikki,Harvey? No kidding'?
muffy," What d'you, mean?"
nikki,"Oh, c'mon."
arch,"Hey, shithead! chickendick!... yeah, you! Skip!"
low angle,ARCH  Skip!
arch,Skip?
arch,Skip?
kit, No Skip?
chaz,No luck.
rob, Where's Arch?
chaz,He isn't with you?
nikki,I don't like this... I definitely don't think I like this...
kit,I think it's about time we called the police.
muffy,Eight-two-four-eight. Constable Potter has an office at his home.
kit, I don't think we should wait any longer...
muffy,I didn't know what kind anybody would like so I just... got them all...
kit,Let me help.
muffy, Has he reached the Constable?
kit,"Rob? No, we haven 't been able to get through to the mainland yet."
kit, No water?
nikki,What's happening.
kit,No water. NIKKI What!
muffy,It happens sometime... But there's still the well all the island homes have some kind of pump... or well... for emergencies.
nikki,Jesus. I'll go. Just point me in the right direction.
harvey, Not without me.
muffy, I'm not worried. I'm sure those two... Skip and Art... they're just up to some kind of stupid trick . . .
harvey, I don't think you should really do that.
nikki, Is that it?
harvey,"Here, let me do it. I've probably had more experience than you."
nikki,"You mean, back home on the farm? HARVEY I know you think I'm a hick, but I'd like to change your mind about that, if you'd only give me the chance."
nikki,Why?
harvey,"Because, I'd really like to plow your field."
nikki, Draw me some water.
harvey,"Aw, crap..."
nikki,What happened?
harvey,I lost the bucket.
nikki,Harve.
harvey,"Hal. The rope was rotten, any fool coulda seen that."
nikki,You didn't.
harvey,"Here, shine your light down so I can get a fix on it."
harvey,"Oh... oh, Jesus!"
nikki,(STARTLED} ...what... HARVEY Stay back! Don't look!
nikki,I'm a big girl now. I think I can handle a few spiders and FROGS ---
harvey,NIKKI --
rob, What is it?
kit, You don't want to know.
nikki," In the well ! Oh, God, the well!"
nikki, Let's go!
kit,"It's okay, Nikki. With the others... they were outdoors. But we're inside now, and we're safe."
nikki," It's all because of what happened on the ferry, isn't it?"
chaz, It was an accident. Don't they know that?
harvey,"Muffy, where do you keep your guns?"
muffy, Guns? We don't keep guns in this house.
muffy, Here.
rob, Hello!
potter,"What are you talking about?  And I'm telling you, I'm here at the hospital now visiting Buck. He came out of surgery last night--It might interest you to know he'll be all right-- and Cal's been here too, the whole time."
rob, With Muffy? What do you mean?
rob, He's on his way. We're supposed to wait here... to stay together...
chaz,What about the ferryman?
rob,It isn't him. They've been together all day.
chaz,What?
kit,I don't understand.
rob, In the meantime... we just wait.
muffy, It's my father's study.
kit, I just came in to make sure everything was secure to lock the windows.
muffy,"Good idea. Sometimes... with the tides... it can take someone all night to get here from the mainland... and even then, sometimes they don't make it..."
harvey, It could be the tides.
chaz,Wait a minute. Aren't we supposed to be staying together? Where're Muffy and Rob?
kit,Rob's checking the back of the house.
chaz,And Muffy?
nikki,She's been acting less than normal anyway.
kit, What do you mean?
nikki,You mean all day and you haven't noticed?
harvey,"Well, who isn't?"
nikki,...and those nurse's shoes.
chaz,What nurse's shoes?
nikki,The clodhoppers she's been wearing today... crepe soles...
harvey,"She was arguing with Nan in the hall, before you and Rob... before you came back alone."
harvey,About something Nan found in her room.
chaz,What? HARVEY  Something about an abortion.
nikki,"I found somethin""g in my room, too"
nikki,...only I don't think it was intended for me .
chaz," Oh, really?"
harvey, And What did you find?
chaz,I didn't find anything.
harvey,We're supposed to believe that?
chaz,That's right.  What about you?
harvey,What about me?
chaz,What's your little secret?
harvey, I don't know What you're talking about.
chaz,"Oh, come on, sport. I walked in on you last night , and you were acting like your ass was on fire..."
harvey,"It wasn't anything... Just some clippings... of some car accidents. CHAZ  Nothing personal in that, I suppose?"
harvey,No! Who hasn't been in a car accident? It's a common thing.
chaz,I haven't.
nikki," What I'd like to know is, how did Muffy find out about these things and why -- ?"
kit,"Stop it! Just stop it all of you!  Do you know what we're saying? That we're actually sitting here discussing the possibility that Muffy, a generous friend, has invited us all here to --"
muffy,I'm going upstairs.
rob,Muffy? We should all stay together.
muffy,This is my house.  I'll be in my room.
harvey,As long as we all stay within shouting distance of each other...
nikki, You coming?
rob,I'm goinq to find the way up to the attic.
kit,Why?
rob,I'm sure we can watch for the Constable better from up there.
harvey,It's all right. I can keep watch on the stairs.
chaz,"Nikki, come on... NIKKI What do you mean, Nikki, come on? Don't give me any of this Nikki, come on."
chaz,What are you doing?
nikki,"Look, stay if you like. Lock your door. Dig a trench. Hang out. But once I leave this place, I'm never coming back."
chaz, We're all supposed to stay together here.
nikki,"Yeah, that's been real effective..."
chaz,So what are you going to do? Just waltz on down to the pier. By yourself. Check your bag with the porter. Then wait for an ocean liner to happen by and pick you up. Is that it?
chaz,What if the Constable never even comes?
nikki,Then I'll swim all the way back to the mainland... I can be strong if I have to. INT. NIKKI'S ROOM - NIGHT
chaz,"Look, just relax--"
nikki,"Three people are dead and you're telling me to relax? CHAZ Nikki, now just hold on a minute, and look at me. Look at me."
nikki,Nice image.
chaz,"No.  I mean, come on, babe. Lighten up a little, huh?"
nikki,"Very funny, Chaz."
chaz, You've got to look on the bright side of things. Everything'll be all right... Huh? Huh?
nikki,Don't be a jerk.
chaz, Oh. Now I'm turning you on. Right?
nikki,Get out of here.
chaz," Ooooh, stop it some more. I love it when you're rough."
chaz, Nikki?
nikki," Real subtle, Chaz."
kit,No one's been up here in years.
kit,Can you see him?
rob,NO. There must not be a light on the boat.
kit,"Or... he's chosen not to use it. ROB Kit? He said something else on the phone, about Muffy."
kit,What?
rob,"He said not to trust anybody. That's why we were to stay together. No one was to be left alone with anyone else... Then he said, especially not with Muffy."
kit,So that's why you let her go upstairs?
rob,That's why I let her go.
kit, What did he mean by that?
rob,I don't know. He wouldn't explain it.
kit,But that's ridiculous...
rob,Is it? He's known her longer than we have.
kit,"Rob, wait a minute. What's that?"
rob,Where?
rob,It's just the dolls.
kit,She's been up here.
rob,"So? She moves toward them while Rob stays by the windows looking out. As she gets closer to the dolls, however, Kit realizes that they have not just been stuck there haphazardly."
kit, Rob?
rob,Jesus...
kit, Rob? . . .
rob,It's Arch and Skip and Nan.
kit,Rob??...
rob,Wait...
rob,What are these other two?
rob,He's here!
rob,Hal!
kit,Nikki?
kit,Chaz?... Nikki?...
kit,Rob!!!
kit,"Rob, what about Muffy?"
rob,Forget her!
kit, She's my friend!
kit, Muffy! Muffy!!
rob, Let's go.
kit,This way!
rob, Forget the doors!
rob, Constable... Mr. Potter?
rob," If there's another flare, we can signal him."
kit,Maybe he went on to the house.
rob,Shit... no key!
kit,Rob!
rob,"""...Pursuant to our previous communication, please be advised that the patient under discussion has still not been found and returned to custody, and it now believed to be attempting to return to her home in your jurisdiction. If encountered, exercise extreme caution and notify us immediately, as Miss St. John has been a patient here for three years and is still considered incorrigibly unstable and extremely dangerous..."""
kit,Miss .St. John? What's it talking about? Muffy hasn't been in any state mental institution for the last three years -- she's been at Vassar!
rob,I don't know... but we've gotta get this boat started. KIT How?
rob,The house. Didn't Muffy say there was another key back in the kitchen?
kit," Oh, no..."
rob,We've got no choice.
kit,I know.
rob,Shit.
kit,Rob?
rob,Huh?
kit,"Rob, I really don't want to go back there."
rob,I know.
kit,Shit.
rob,"I'd have you stay here, but--"
kit,No.
rob," Listen, Kit, we'll get out of here, I promise you. We've been through so much together..."
kit, Okay.
rob,Well...
kit,Yeah...
rob,Let's go.
kit,Let's go.
rob,Let's go.
rob,Shit...
kit,"Rob, look! The doors. They've been closed."
rob,Come on.
rob,There. He is pointing toward the open basement window across a thirty foot space of clear lawn.
rob,That's how we're going in.
rob,Are you with me?
rob, The stairs... Where are the stairs?...
kit,What's that?
kit,Muffy's clothes...
rob, I don't get it.
kit, Rob!
kit,"Oh, god... oh no!..."
kit,"...the picture of the girls in the study... the letter... what the Constable was trying to tell you... It's not Muffy it's her twin sister, Buffy! She has a twin sister! Rob's eyes have a glazed look. They are fixed somewhere else."
kit,"Rob, don't you see?  Rob?"
kit, Rob!
rob,Pull it away...
kit, Rob?
rob,Pull it away!
rob,The boat key... it's gotta be here...
rob,Kit... I
kit,No...
rob,Kit! Let me out! Let me out of here! Kit!!
rob," Kit! Run, Kit, run!"
rob,Kit! I love you!
rob," Kit! I love you! I love you, Kit!"
buck,"I love you too, babe."
kit,"No... Oh, God..."
kit, What.... ?
kit," Oh, fuck you!! Fuck you, you guys!!"
rob,Kit! !
rob,Ki--!
muffy,You guys are really terrific. I love you all. And I thank you from the bottom of my heart for being such good sports.
rob," Oh, sure. Quite welcome. Any time."
muffy,"Rob, you and Kit, you two were the best. You figured it all out. The clues really worked."
rob,What clues?
kit,"What's this all about? And don't anyone say ""April Fool's"" or I'll smack them in the teeth."
muffy,How about if I told you it was the script for a weekend special that's going to help me keep this house...
muffy," Look, next month I get the house as part of my inheritance, it's true, but only if I can show my father that it can carry itself... what with taxes and expenses. Otherwise, he'll just sell it out of the family. So, I'm planning on turning it into a country inn. Not just another stuffy old run-of-the-mill country inn, but one that specializes in offering once-in-a lifetime Whodunit Weekends. I needed a rehearsal. I had to try out the idea on somebody."
rob, And you guys played along?
arch,Don't look at me!
nikki,"We all got sucked in just as bad as you! MUFFY Once they were killed off, yes. Everybody had to cooperate. Otherwise, none of it would have worked!"
rob,So I guess there's no crazy twin sister Buffy?
muffy,"Oh, there's a crazy twin all right, but his name isn't Buffy."
nikki,His name?
chaz,Skip?!
kit,He's your brother?!
arch,"You bastard, you were in on the whole deal, too."
skip, Only the set-up. Muffy told me to say I was her cousin and to pull that prank on the ferry. I had no idea what was going to happen with Buck.
muffy," Buck Williams. make-up artist par excellence, from Hollywood."
buck,"Here, catch."
buck,Just some old props I redressed with the help of photographs Muffy sent me.
nikki,It sure fooled me.
arch," Well, first he's got to prove he can manage his own allowance."
kit," Which means, I guess, that you're no constable either."
muffy,"Kit Graham, meet my Uncle Frank St. John of St. John et Freres, Wall Street."
harvey,"Hi! Harvey ""Hal"" Edison, Jr. Pleased to meet you, sir."
muffy,"Usually we don't even see Uncle Frank in the summer, he's so busy. But this time he made an exception. UNCLE FRANK I haven't had this much fun since my Hasty pudding Show sophomore year at Harvard. God, lowe you kids!"
ferryman cal," How'd I do? I never did no acting before. Boy, was I shaking!"
muffy,"Cal's our regular ferryman between the mainland and the islands around here... but I thought he was up to the dramatic challenge.  Well, that's it. Now you know it all."
nikki,We have been had.
rob,You're lucky you didn't get yourself killed.
muffy," I almost did with Harvey. And who could know there would be a snake out in the woods with Arch? But with the paying guests, they'll know what they're in for: and the scenario won't be nearly so extreme."
uncle frank,"Otherwise, even Lloyd's of London won't cover you. MUFFY ...And I regret that, well, some of those fake clues I planted in the bedrooms I guess were taken too seriously. I'm sorry about that."
arch,"You're telling me. Man, when I was swinging around out there in the woods, I nearly crapped my pants."
cal,"What do you mean, nearly? I was there, remember?"
chaz, Arch? You browned your trousers?
arch, Well... I...
uncle frank," It's all right, Arch. They'll be out of the dryer soon."
arch,Great ham.
buck,Great eggs. CHAZ  Just what we need. Another country inn.
uncle frank,"Well, if the food's any indication, it's already half-way there."
skip,"Pass the toxic wastes, please."
cal," The St. John Island Bar Harbor ferry leaves in thirty minutes. No stragglers, please."
rob,"Boy, what a difference being alive makes."
kit, I don't care what Columbia says about you.
rob,I do.
kit, Is this the road to med school?
rob,I think it is. I'm going to try.
rob,"But if I make it or not, no matter what happens, we'll be together? You and me?"
kit, If that's what you want.
rob," That's what I want. Muffy enters with a stack of dishes, followed by Nan who quietly sets her plate on the counter and leaves."
muffy,Where's Nikki?
kit,I don't know. Too much champagne?
nikki, God... don't tell me that was something you learned on the farm!
uncle frank,I'll make a full and glowing report to your father tomorrow so he can draw up the deed along with the other trust papers for Wednesday's signing. I'm so proud of you.  I wish I could say the same about your brother.
muffy,"Oh, Uncle Frank, he's been a great help this weekend, really. Let me get him out here so you can--"
uncle frank,I've already spoken with him.
rob, Excuse me. He turns and walks back into the house.
uncle frank,Come on! Let's go!
kit,"Well, I hate to say it -- I still ought to kill you -- but thanks.  See you back there."
uncle frank,"Come on. If time is money, we're losing a fortune."
muffy,Nan!
muffy,"Let me say again how sorry I am. It wasn't intended. NAN And now all is forgiven. I played along, didn't I? What's done is done.  Thanks for showing me your house."
uncle frank,"Cal, I want to thank you personally. You've been a real sport about this."
cal,"Aw, it was fun."
uncle frank,I know you've had your eye on that p1ace ever since we were kids. And I'm sure we could make a deal with you. I know you haven't been spending your money on anything else all these years... But... this time it just isn't in the cards.
cal,It's still in the family.
uncle frank,"Yes, that's the way."
chaz,"This time, no funny business."
chaz, Feeling better?
nikki," I'm okay now, thanks."
nikki,"Chaz, I'm sorry."
chaz,Why? What do we mean to each other anyway?
nikki,More than this a couple of days ago.
chaz," A couple of days ago... A couple of days ago I was a great, young, budding filmmaker who was going to turn pornography into high art. Today I'm just a stupid college kid with a toy camera and about as much idea as where he's going as... as..."
nikki, Don't be down. CHAZ Sure.
nikki,I'll tell you what I've learned from all this. I'm tired of having one fling after another. I don't want any more of that. I want a boyfriend.  Chaz? Will you be my boyfriend?
rob,"Some party, huh?"
arch," You know what I think's weird?... how, when we thought 'Buck here got hurt because of Skip's prank, and when things started happening and we thought maybe some of us were getting killed, how we all just kind of naturally accepted the fact that it was 'oh , yeah, sure, because of the prank.'"
skip, What're you talking about?
arch,"Well, it's like pranks really piss people off. It unleashes things, you know? Makes any kind of behavior possible, and we accept it."
nikki,"When anything g.oes, everything goes."
chaz,Yeah.
rob,"What really amazes me is how easy we made it for her. Everyone was just out for himself. We could've stopped Muffy cold if we'd only stuck together, if we'd only worked like a team."
chaz,"Yeah, she really got us good."
skip,"Well, I know what I'd do, if I wasn't her brother... NIKKI  Go back and give her a taste of her own medicine, that's what we should do."
skip," Did I say anything? The others look at each other, a beat, registering."
arch,Hey...
chaz,Go back and scare the shit outta her for a change? Outrageous!
nikki,She sure wouldn't be expecting it...!
harvey," Well, I don't know. I got a stack o' books this high..."
rob," Look, what're you talking about? We've had our fun. Now we got work to do."
arch,Yeah. Enough's enough. At least for me anyway.
chaz,Pussies.
kit,"Well, I kinda like the idea -- and I don't have work to get back to."
rob, Kit...
kit,(DECIDEDLYL Muffy can dish it out. It might be interesting to see if she can take it. CHAZ All right! A real catfight!
rob, I don't believe you...
kit," Just because you've decided to get serious about your life, doesn't mean the rest of us can't have our fun"
nikki," Buck, got any spare professional tricks you could throw our way!"
kit,So how many does that make us?
skip, Much as I'd like to...
nan," No, I don't think so, thank you."
rob, Four.
chaz, Outasight!
kit,"Cal, we want to get back to the island."
ferryman,Now? You just left
kit,"I know. FERRYMAN [PONDERING) ...Well, not in this...  ...but you might find something around after we dock."
muffy, H'lo?
skip," Hi, it's me. Surprise."
muffy, What'd you forget now?
skip,Nothing. Just calling to tell you the party's not over.
muffy,I know. The clean-up's going to take Clara and me at least a week.
skip,"No, I mean, some of the gang's planning on coming back to give you some of your own medicine."
muffy,You're kidding. SKIP Does a bear shit in the woods?
muffy,Those bastards...
skip,"Hey, they're your friends."
muffy,Which ones?
skip,"That wouldn't be very sporting if I told you, would it?"
muffy, Skip...
skip,Rob and Kit and Nikki and Chaz.
muffy,Figures... Thanks.
skip,"Well, Uncle Frank told me about his recommendations. So, I didn't want you to think there were any hard feelings."
muffy," Oh, Skip, you dope. You know Daddy'll come around just as soon as you decide to buckle down."
skip,"Yeah...  Anyway, don't let the bastards eat you up."
muffy,I'll try not to act too surprised when they arrive.
skip,"I love you, Sis."
muffy,"You too, goofball."
arch,It was even your idea.
skip,A petty consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.
arch,"Bullshit. St. John blood is thicker than water, that's what you mean."
skip, Don't you know? Old money sticks together.
harvey,"Well, can I look you up in a couple of months? Maybe you could arrange a job interview for me."
uncle frank,"Sure, sure .  Here's my card."
harvey," Thank you, sir. Thanks a lot. I sure appreciate it, and it's been a real pleasure meeting you."
harvey,"Hey, wait a minute! There's no phone number here! No address! No nothing! Too late. Uncle Frank is driving away. He speeds past Skip who is walking down the road further along. He doesn't even stop for his own nephew."
chaz,What the fuck was he talking about anyway? We might find something around after we dock?
rob,What the fuck do you think he was talking about?
chaz,Oh.
chaz,"Well, now we've been identified."
rob,Swell.
chaz,It's getting late.
rob,What a great idea this was.
nikki,(CALLING} We got one!
rob,I thought we looked there an hour ago.
chaz,Who cares? Let's get this show on the road!
chaz, Did you find a key? How're we going to get the motor started?
muffy,"Nikki, what on earth are you doing here? Is something wrong?"
nikki,"No, no, nothing's wrong. Chaz and I just figured there was nothing we had to get back to that couldn't wait and you could probably use a hand with the clean-up. It's our way of saying thank you."
muffy,"Oh, great. Where is Chaz?"
nikki,Putting the boat up in the old boathouse. He'll be up in a minute.
nikki,I wonder what's keeping Chaz? He should have been up here by now.
muffy,Maybe he stopped to shit in the woods. You know Chaz.
nikki,Still... I'm beginning to not like this.
muffy,"By the way, where did you get the boat to come back here?"
nikki,"The boat? Oh, Cal gave us one."
muffy,I see.
muffy,What about your water?
nikkl,"Oh', uh, I drank 'it in there.  Listen. Muffy , I'm really getting worried about Chaz. I think we should go out and see what's happened."
muffy,That's okay. You go. I'll wait here.
nikki,"No, really. I don't want to go alone. I'm still scared from last night. Please come with me. MUFFY I'm sure Chaz is fine. I'll stay here by the phone just in case. It's safer this way.  Do you want a flashlight?"
nikki," No, that's okay. I'll be fine."
nikki, Shit.
nikki,Fuck!
nikki,Fuck!! Who dug the goddamn swimming pool?!? She drags herself out.
nikki, Yeah!
chaz,She wouldn't come out? Doesn't she care about me?
nikki,"A lot goddamn, fucking better than I do!"
nikki," ...he's hurt! Oh, Godl!"
nikki,Muffy!!
nikki,Muff--!!!
nikki, Muffy?
nikki,"Chaz, get up! Hurry, Chaz!... come on!"
nikki,Chaz!
chaz, Will you quit kicking me? It hurts.
nikki,It's supposed to hurt! The game's over! Get up!
chaz, No. I'm dead. You're blowing the whole thing. Where's Muffy?
nikki," Oh, God..."
chaz, What?
nikki," Kit! Kit, come out!"
kit,What's going on?
nikki,She's gone!
kit,What?...
chaz,"Look, she's been dragged away."
nikki, Chaz! somebody's still in this house!
chaz,We could follow the trail.
kit, Rob!!
kit,Rob...?
kit, What the fuck is going on here?!
nikki," Chaz, look!"
chaz, This was Nan's...
nikki, Nan...
nikki,Muffy!
muffy,"Good job, you guys. I'm really scared.  The fun's over, Rob."
kit," Muffy, he's dead!"
nikki,Somebody else is here! In this house!
muffy,Sure. Sure.  Don't you touch him!!
muffy,"Okay, okay, take it easy."
nikki,"Muffy, it's not a game anymore!"
muffy, What the--?
kit,"Muffy! Stop him! Help! He's killing me! Oh, God! He's killing me!"
skip," It's all over, Muffy! Everything'll be mine!"
muffy,Skip! No! ! !
