Speaker,Dialogue
doctor,"What are you going to do when you get out of here? You're going to have to wear a belt for six months, maybe a year..."
freddie,What kind of belt?
doctor,A surgical belt. You won't be able to do very heavy lifting.
freddie,.I try to stay away from that.
doctor,But you spend time outdoors.
doctor,What do you do?
doctor,You didn't have very much on you when you were admitted. Where were you going?
freddie,"I was on my way to Placerville. To the Fair. Had a job waiting for me, with a friend of mine. He doesn't know where I am."
doctor,"How old are you, Freddie?"
doctor,Why don't you turn honest? You seem like an intelligent fellow. 'Quick on your feet - you like to drink?
freddie,It's a weakness. But I like it.
doctor,I know what the other is too.
freddie,How can you tell that? I'm clean.
doctor,The tattoo's.
freddie,Is that a weakness...
doctor,No one ever made money chasing girls.
freddie,You're wrong. This tatoo's my Auntie.
doctor,Who's that?
freddie,"My Auntie Bertha,  But that doesn't mean I don't have a weakness..."
doctor,College?
freddie,"I tried that, it didn't work."
doctor,Why'd you leave?
freddie,"Sometimes my hypo's get the best of me, I really feel like walking into the street and hitting people's hats off."
doctor,That's how you end up like this. With a burst appendix.
freddie,That's when I know it's time to get to the sea.. what kind of belt?
doctor,A medical belt. Similar for lifting. You're going to need some money. What do you plan to do?
freddie,I'm going to pay back the hospital. And you.
doctor,You don't owe me anything. I'm on surgical duty. But you're expected to pay the hospital for medicines. And your belt.
freddie,Alright. I intend to do that. You saying you have a job for me? What? As an orderly?
doctor,"You couldn't be an orderly, it's too much lifting -- and a lot of things you'd have to learn. But maybe you could run an elevator, something of that sort."
freddie,"I want to get out of here, but I also like it here. You think I was gonna die?"
doctor,"I know you were, Freddie."
freddie,I don't know. I'm not saying you didn't save me... . but...I can't seem to die.
doctor,Too lucky?
freddie,Something like that.
doctor,Were you in the service?
freddie,"Yes, sir."
doctor,Navy?
doctor,"Your luck was up this time, Freddie. You should have seen the pus in your belly. Something to think about. It's not too late to stop being a weisnheimer, no matter what you think. you're still a young man."
freddie,You come any closer and I'll slice your

freddie,I don't have any cigarettes...
donna,What do you make this liquor with?
freddie,"There's secrets in liquor, this is just booze."
day,"Maybe a few months later, FREDDIE looks worse for wear. He's been hired to work at a BEET DISTILLATE as a BENCH CHEMIST. The FOREMAN walks him though the process; it's clear that there is enough chemicals and beets here to make some good booze... MEXICAN and FILIPINO workers HARVEST THE BEETS, load them to wagons - unload/wash - end up with FREDDIE: He works the bench, making his HOME MADE VODKA. This stuff is quite toxic and very strong.

master,This boy is just a simple stow-away. All things he says he is.
mary sue,"I believe... Master fiddles around with his things, belongings, wallet, out on a table. He looks at the FLASK. Smells it. Pours the contents into a glass; looks at the liquid."

freddie,.What do you do?
master,"I am many things. I am writer, a doctor, a nuclear physicist, a theoretical philosopher. Above all, I am a man, A hopelessly inquisitive Man, just like you."
freddie,Where's your money come from?
master,Many years of successful writing and publishing has made me self sufficient. Reader's in all languages have enjoyed my work - but now I'm retired to study the mid and the spirit...my life's true work.
master,These studies have made me a target and I am hunted for what I know. Which is why... it is so un-wise to go lurking and jumping on strange ships.. .how do we know what your motives are?
freddie,".well: I apologize if I got a little out of hand last night - I'm just... looking for work and your ship looked good, so...it's a nice looking ship."
master,"Don't apologize. You're a scoundrel. How I miss the days of working a four mastered schooner with nothing but salt horse, dried peas and a couple quarts of water.. .the present-day maritimer's seem so much more fragile, don't you think? You - you're and adventurer."
master,"An able bodied seamen, a maker of wine, and a dashing mischievousness is what I knew would come to me in this-lifetime. .would you study with me? Submit yourself?"
freddie,I don't understand what you're talking about.
master,"I am always looking for mature men of unusual ability who are willing to stretch the boundaries of what they know. To increase knowing-ness and communication amongst man. I need day-ta. And with your help, I can gather it..."
master,"You already understand, you just need to remember. And only say yes. Say, 'yes.'"
freddie,I'm not saying yes to anything I don't
master,What's-about-this?'
freddie,What about it?
master,"As a Scientist and a Conniseur I have no idea the contents of this remarkable potion, what's in it."
freddie,Secrets.
master,Can you make more?
master,I'll grant you a full reprive from your naughtiness as a stow-away if you make us some more. I must admit I sampled some and ended up drinking it all.
freddie,It's just booze.
master,Horrible Hooch?
freddie,"Horrible Hooch. BEAT. They both smile, laugh a little. MASTER gets up and comes over him..."
master,"Would you scrub yourself up and make yourself clean? My daughter is getting married. Come and join us and leave your worries for a while, they'll still be there when you get back..he he he. You are invited."
master,I think we have known each other before you and I -
freddie,Oh yeah?
master,"It will come out over time, but yes. We are re-united... do you reember me?"
freddie,.I don't know...
master,That's alright. Don't strain yourself. You will. There will be much time to discuss this on the journey to our destination. As we travel down Time- Holes...you won't be afraid will you?
freddie,.what destination?
master,Have you ever had harm cme to you?
freddie,Sure.
master,What if we could return to a period of your life where there was harm and do away with it? .would You like that?

freddie,Yes.
val,What are you goign to be working on?
freddie,I don't really know.
val,Have you done any time-hole work?

master,"Enough! Enough! I must get back to work! Keep going! Dont stop all night long! He leaves. FREDDIE just looks around, caught up in it all."
mary sue,"He's been writing all night ...I think you've inspired something in hi,. When we're at home, on land, there's too much, pulling him in each direction."
freddie,Who's attacking him?
mary sue,"People that are scared. People that are greedy. Ex-wives...That's what's so nice about being at sea. He gets his studies done, advances the learning, and he writes BOOK II."
freddie,What's a time-hole?
wayne,"Say, ""back beyond"" and return to the pre- natal area."
susan,Back beyond. Back beyond. Back beyond. Back beyond. Back beyond. Back beyond.
wayne,Continue please...
susan,Back beyond..I Have.. something in my face... It feels like I am being pushed.
wayne,Contact it more closely and continue to repeat.
susan,Back beyond. Back beyond. It's getting stronger.
susan,I hear a voice..It's my father's voice.
wayne,"Listen to the words and repeat them, please."
susan,He is talking to my mother. The face pressure is hurting. It's uncomfortable. It keeps going up and down and it hurts.
wayne,"Repeat his words, please."
susan,"""I don't want to come in you now. Let's wait."" The pressure is banging my face. Into my face. My mother is there, her voice..."
wayne,"What is your mother saying? Please, if you hear her?"
susan,"She saying ""well get out of there then. I don't want you in me at all if your not there to come. Get in to come."" She's mad."
wayne,Please return to the start of this and recount.
susan,I wonder what they're doing? I hear a squishing sounds and it's wet. Oh. Oh my.
wayne,Recount please.
susan,"A faint rhythm ...then faster. I hear my fathers voice say, ""oh honey..I wont come in you now. I'm not too sure I like children that well and I have my job to worry about..."" And my mother must shove him - a sharper pain here - ""THEN I DON'T"
wayne,"Return to the beginning and recount it again, please. CU. FREDDIE's FACE Listening. Mary Sue leans over and whispers:"

bill white,"Master! Hello. Yes. Welcome. Welcome back to New York City, Master. It's our honor, its our pleasure. We are humble and so happy..."
master,"Thank you, Bill, good to see you. BILL leads the way, waves his hand to the show:"
bill white,We'd like to present you with this gift from the New York Branch for your stay here ...we know how fond you are of motorcycles. He presents a HARLEY-DAVIDSON..
master,Loooooooooook at that... 1940 Harley Davidson Knucklehead. For me?

john more,"Some of this seems quite like hypnosis, is it not?"
master,"Oh no, this is funny. It's quite the reverse. Man is hypnotized. What we do is un-hypnotize him of the shackles. Allow him to raise his awareness and IQ."
john more,What is the difference between this and psychotherapy?
master,"Yes. Well. They are very different. No. Psychoanalysis, they lay back. No, no, no. Don't associate us with such people! That's terrible  why that's a bad manner don't you know? I mean at that business about sex and all that. That's for the neurotic or the person who is insane or something like that. That's nothing to do with us. They've failed. That's for the fortunate few who can afford the fees."
john more,"But some of this does in fact seem to share quite a lot with Dr. Freud and modern psychotherapy, does it not?"
master,"No it does not. This is an exact science, you see. Comparable to physics or chemistry - but simpler. It's engineering. Herr Freud had his chance and contributed some very workable data, but in the end, he failed. So that's that."
john more,And how long does this take?
master,That depends. But it can be quite fast. Quite fast. Or it can take some time. Sometimes less than 36 hours.
john more,36 hours? And you're saying that these methods can cure leukemia according to your book and what you've just said?
master,"Some forms of leukemia, 22 cases tested. 22 cases cured. Those are the results."
john more,"You can understand scepticism, can you not?"
master,"Oh, yes, of course, yes. And this is to be expected and welcome. For without it we'd be positive's with no negatives - therefore zero. charge. We must have it."
john more,Are you a religious people?
master,"We are not incorporated as a religion, no. But remember this: that religion has come uniformly from a philosophy. Philosophy is senior to religion. You could call us a religion of religions."
john more,Are you saying then that any religion is rather narrow in its outlook?
master,"No, no, no. I have no quarrel with man's belief's, but religions in general can be pre-occupied with a God or Idol or something of some such nature who is merely trying to fill the universe with a lot of little replicas of himself - we are trying to free the individual - not bend to a will of a God, you see. And if our teachings can reconcile these views it would be doing a great service to"
john more,Do you think it can?
master,"I not only think it can, I know it does."
john more,"You mentioned 'good science' and what it does.. .but doesn't that, by definition, allow for more than one opinion?"
master,"Indeed, indeed. Which is why our gathering of day-ta is so far reaching -"
john more,"Otherwise you merely have the will of one man - which is the basis of cult, is it not?"
master,"T'is, t'is, indeed. Thankfully we are, all of us, working at break-neck speeds and in unison towards catching the minds fatal flaws and correcting it back to it's original state of perfect - whilst righting civilization."
john more,I must say that I find it quite --
john more,I can answer for myself. My name is John More.
john more,If you're not allowing some sort of discussion regarding your beliefs -
john more,I'm sorry if you're unwilling to defend your beliefs in any kind of rational
a woman,She's sick! Please! She's sick!
john more,"This isn't a lecture hall, this is Mrs. Purcell's home -"
freddie,You have the name's and information of the guests at this lady's party?
bill white,Yes.
freddie,"You're coming with me. Get up. I need some help and you wanna make a good show, no? Who's paying your way? CLARK looks to Elizabeth, who gives a look that says, ""He's right."""
bill white,I don't think this is right to do -
freddie,"You don't know what we're going to do, so don't bother thinking about this anymore... CAMERA with FREDDIE AND CLARK as they walk out of the hotel and into the streets of New York --"
clark,Some.
freddie,"Where are you from, Clark?"
clark,Los Angeles. Pasadena.
freddie,What's there?
clark,I'm from there. Master and headquarters there for a year.
freddie,.how'd you see them?
clark,"I read the first book. I worked at Boeing for three years. When I read the book, I didn't want to waste my time there anymore. I came to help the Cause."
freddie,What did it say?
clark,"I'm skeptical of everything. Always have been. All I know is I used to not be able to sleep. Now I sleep through the night. I spent 18 months at the Presidio with every Army head-shrinker they had and not one did as much for me as Book One did. That's simple arithmetic to me. And I met Elizabeth, so..."
freddie,That's good.
clark,He changes things. And the research is hard to keep up with. None of this is done by a long shot. Sometimes it's easy to get lost.
freddie,"He's a very smart man. I can tell that. I don't understand myself but - more time with it and I might - I feel better - I feel like I've more to do with my life since I met him... and I JUST met him. So - that can't be a bad thing, right?"
freddie,I have a delivery for Mr. More. Special. Late night delivery. I need a signature.
john more,"Delivery... must be urgent from the University... He gets a robe on, makes the walk down the hallway -- He comes to the door... .FREDDIE smashes it down...CLARK is here and watches, does nothing... .FREDDIE drags him along the floor, CAMERA moves over and sees: MRS. MORE... .FREDDIE takes care of them both...ends up tying them up.. .scaring them, etc. Takes some valuables -- FINDS"
clark,You know... at first there were rumors going around about you...
freddie,What about me...?
clark,"Well, when you first were found on board. People were saying you were looking for Split Saber. That you were trying to steal The Split Saber if it was on board."
freddie,What? Steal what?
clark,The Split Saber.
freddie,I don't understand what you're saying.
clark,The Split Saber.
freddie,I still don't understand what you're saying...
clark,The Darkest Cloud? AKA Dual Saber? Or The Split Saber?
freddie,.no...
clark,".it's what started all this. Back then...in 1941, Master...he'd been in operation, in army hospital. He died on the table...gone for seven minutes...but"
freddie,The truth about all what?
clark,Life on this planet. .Freddie stares at him... then takes a good long look at the BURLESQUE DANCER AND HER BREASTS. THEN BACK TO CLARK:
freddie,What is something like that worth?
clark,"He said he was once offered $25,000 dollars for it...but the price is... . how could you figure out what the price is on something like that? Heretofore unknown. Incalculable by man."
freddie,Where is it?
clark,It's locked away in a vault somewhere? I don't know.
freddie,Where?
clark,No one knows for sure. Some say Phoenix or the desert outside Los Angeles.
freddie,Needed for what?
clark, ? I don't know.
freddie,How do you know about this?
clark,"Everyone knows about it. It's the original text. FREDDIE just sort of looks, then looks back to the NAKED"
freddie,There's something... something that can hepp you...you... If you need helpp in yer life... .where is it?
clark,The Martinique Hotel...
freddie,Thizz helped me. It can help you.. you can go back in time and learn thingz... He is about to say..
master,What is it?
freddie,I don't think John More will be speaking out against you again.
master,This isn't the way...you heard me say to attack and you attacked?
freddie,You were right.
freddie,You were right. . .he had a wise-ass mouth.
master,My little Soldier.. .what did you do?... . you need to tell me so that I know...
freddie,That's why I won't tell you. Nothing bad. Just scared him good.
mary sue,"Whatever you've done, best not come back to Master or the Cause."
freddie,It won't.
master,"But-this-is-not-the-way-you-naughty-boy. Ok? Alright. Freddie: You-are-mischeif. Horrible young man you are! The PHONE RIGHTS, Mary Sue moves and picks it up, speaks OC, we stay with MASTER and FREDDIE:"
freddie,"I don't really think about all that stuff with my Auntie, you know ...I got other things going on besides that thing I told you about.. .that's yesterday's news to me, so..."
master,Your problems aren't with your auntie or your mommy or daddy or any such things.
master,You have seeded aberrations in this way. Absolute rejection of authority and nay- sayers.
freddie,I don't like smart-mouths. If that's what you mean.
master,"Don't act out. This anger and battle has been there from before you remember. Before you know. It's not you, Freddie. It's not...I promise you. Freddie takes it all in."
freddie,"-- what is it? He grasps his shoulders, touches his head to Freddie."
master,"It's just Q-44...all it is. Trillions of years ago - little implants.. BEAT. He pulls back, smiles..."
freddie,Keep an eye on him?
master,And report back to me...
freddie,Alright. MASTER leaves.
elizabeth,Hi.
freddie,Hi.
elizabeth,Why aren't you downstairs?
freddie,I'm working.
elizabeth,What are you doing?
freddie,Errands.
elizabeth,"You're not an errand boy...you're a loafer... you're doing more than that, I can tell. BEAT. She steps up close to him."
freddie,I didn't do anything.
elizabeth,I'm my father's daughter. Don't tell me you did nothing. It was just what was needed to be done. And you took it upon yourself. Shereaches for his face;
freddie,No.
elizabeth,Why not?
freddie,It's too strong.
elizabeth,I'm a big girl.
freddie,Not big enough yet -
elizabeth,I could just steal some...
freddie,Don't argue with me. You're Father's speaking .get dressed and get down there...
master,THANK YOU! THANK YOU! Well? Down but not out. Not Dead Yet!  he he he he.
freddie,Bobby?
freddie,It's Freddie.
freddie,Are you home?
freddie,"I'm comin' over - He hangs up. He looks back across the street at the group in the coffee shop. And WALKS AWAY, OFF DOWN THE STREET..."
freddie,Where's everybody?
bob,We're havin' a party. Where you coming from? Where you been?
freddie,Here and there. Antarctica. Where's your dad?
bob,"Not here, working. Get in here you gotta see these two girls. Antarctica? They greet each other and go inside."
freddie,Where's my mom?
bob,I heard she was in Florida.
freddie,Where's your mom?
bob,"Left. She's back living in Princeton. It's the best since she's gone. My dad's never here. This place is mine. Did you see these girls? ANGLE, LATER. FREDDIE and the BOYS. FREDDIE pours a tiny bit of his booze into the beers for them..."
freddie,Anybody ever hear about stolen jewels and money in the sewers?
bob,Where?
freddie,Near Harlem. They shake their heads.
boy,I heard about that.
boy 2,I heard about that too.
freddie,Anybody want to go look for it?
freddie,"Let's go this way and that way - come with me - BOB follows FREDDIE, the rest go the other way - VARIOUS ANGLES watching them move around, etc."
bob,My mom signed my early entrance to the army.
freddie,How'd she do that?
bob,She just signed this letter I made up saying my birth certificate was burned in a fire. She's happy to let me go.
freddie,"You don't want to go there, dummy."
bob,"There's a lot of pussy there, Freddie. I like those Korean girls the way they look."
freddie,You're an idiot.
bob,"I'd rather be there than here. Pussy over there... I've been licking so much pussy this summer... They keep walking. BOB is drunk. He turns, says to"
freddie,No.
bob,"I did... Bob smiles, giggles... stumbles forward...walks...Freddie watching him..."
freddie,There's nothing here...let's just go...
bob,Yeah. WE'RE COMING BACK!!!! MEET BACK. THE BOYS hear this and head back -
freddie,"Bob... BOB turns ...FREDDIE in kneeling down, aims the"
boys,Where were those?
bob,Right here.
freddie,I found them right here.
boy 2,Holy shit.
helen sullivan,"If you come, we can guarantee an audience of one hundred people three nights a week and six afternoons a week. We have an engineer from Western Electric who is willing to record all of the lectures for free onto high fidelity audio tapes. Perhaps these can be used for sale. I assure you, you will find a very open city. People with open minds... we keep the bad ones out. I know that new sciences can attract quacks and some strange people, but keep them all away.. MASTER and MARY SUE listening to Helen. NORMAN CONRAD stands to the side..."
master,"You are very right about one thing, Helen: this is a dirty city of nothing good. MASTER thinks ... . Everyone looks around at each other ...A WOMAN STARTS SINGING..."
mary sue,You see anything last night?
freddie,.with what?
mary sue,With Val.
freddie,No.
mary sue,How does that happen?
freddie,.lost 'em in the streets...
mary sue,. or maybe you drink too much and you get cross-eyed.
master,Get thee behind me --
joan,"And push. They disperse. PIANO STARTS IN AGAIN... Everyone is relaxed, sitting around. New faces "
woman,".a once-a-month meeting... this last Saturday night we had a chiropractor..and he spoke about 'Handwriting Analysis'... MASTER is distracted... as he listens: HE RUBS HIS NOSE AND PULLS HIS EAR, CATCHING FREDDIE'S EYE. As we hear the woman ramble on, FREDDIE gets his FLASK, moves discreetly to get a glass, make a drink and brings it to MASTER. This is unnoticed by everyone but MARY SUE. The WOMAN"
master,Cheers to that! Everyone raises their glasses and DRINKS. MASTER downs his new drink. A calm... then Master gently protificates:
mary sue,You can do. Whatever you want. As long as I don't find out. And as long. As. Anyone I know. Doesn't know. Other than that. You stop this idea. And you put it back in its pants. It didn't work for them. And it's not gonna work for you. We. Have. Enough problems. Cum for me.
master,Yes. Yes.
mary sue,Do it. And get your best behavior out... cum for me...
master,"Yes, master."
mary sue,And no more of that boy's booze.
master,"Yes master. He comes, collapses, sinks to the floor. She washes her hands and walks out of the bathroom."
master,Try to recall how you feel...
woman,"Oh, I'm sort of glad it's the end.."
master,What happens next?
woman,The doctor puts a stethoscope to her chest..
master,What is the doctor wearing?
woman,A white coat.
master,Is there a smell in the room?.
woman,It smells like a hospital.
master,Try to imagine what a hospital smells like.
woman,Uugh. Uugh. Alright.
master,What does the doctor say?
woman,"He listens to her chest and says, ""She's gone."" FREDDIE and VAL are sitting in the front foyer of the house, facing each other in two folding chairs...we see the. STAGE IN THE B.G... .VAL is bored and nodding off to sleep ...FREDDIE watches VAL. FREDDIE kicks his chair --"
freddie,Wake up. Your Father's speaking.. .you could learn something.
val,What's that?
freddie,You heard me.
val,"He's making this up as he goes, don'tcha know..? You can sleep and wake up and not have missed anything..."
freddie,Maybe you should pay more attention.
val,You have something to say to me?
freddie,I'm curly-q. Round in circles. So shut up. .FREDDIE takes a nice big drink from his FLASK... FREDDIE looks out the open front door: TWO POLICEMAN AND A MARSHALL are parking their cars and walking towards the house...
policeman,We're looking for Lancaster Dodd.
freddie,I don't know who that is...
policeman,May we come in?
freddie,No. You cannot.
val,Yes you can. He's up there - VAL points to the stage...
freddie,"You can't come in. Get outta here. MASTER, ON STAGE, looks out - AGAINST THE GLARE OF THE DOOR, he can recognize the FIGURES AS UNIFORMED..."
policeman,We have a civil warrant to serve to Lancaster Dodd to appear in Philadelphia Bankruptcy Court - an arrest warrant -
val,"Stay out of their way, Freddie. MASTER walks down to see what's happening."
master,What is happening here?
policeman,Are you Lancaster Dodd?
master,Yes I Am.
policeman,"We have an arrest warrant for you, sir..."
master,What are the charges?
policeman,By order of Pennsylvania District Court by the Mildred Purcell Foundation for wrongful withdraw of funds. And operating a medical school without a license. That's.what we'll have to take you in for
master,"This is a silly joke, no?"
marshall,"No, sir it isn't. But we have to take you in and book and fingerprint you."
master,This is comic opera. Is it illegal in this city to get better?
marshall,Please put your hands behind your back.
master,"I have no disagreement with you boys doing your work in all its silliness as defenders of what code? What honor? What part of the galaxy? This is a scientific gathering - you will cuff me from the front, if you please -- He raises his ARMS for HANDCUFFS. FOLLOWERS COME FORWARD"
master,"Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. He gets up close to FREDDIE, whispers in his ear;"
freddie,I don't want to talk to you right now.
master,"This is FBI work, Russians maybe... this... too much work for the"
freddie,Stop talking...
master,"You're fear of capture and imprisonment is an implant from millions of years ago. An Invader Force played games with your spirit as it.moved from one body to the next - free for a moment - it was free and the invader force captured it - spun you around in a device not unlike a grinder and hit you with waves of high wattage electrical impulses - quaver bolts to damage you. The impulse lodges and plants the push-pull instinct, dumped in scalding hot water, then freezing cold - a control mechanism - any legal action, a summons to court, the sight of a police officer, exposes a glandular reaction and anxiety wave of the highest order,"
freddie,Horseshit.
master,I don't have any opinions. I'm giving you facts.
freddie,Just shut-your-mouth? You're a fucking
master,"ME shut my mouth? You're a fucking DRUNK. You CACTUS. Play a game with me? I don't think so, you little yo-yo. That ain't the way. You want to shut me up? I'm the best and only friend you have, shut me up from saving you? HELPING YOU. ONLY WAY. FIND ANOTHER ONE, YO-YO. You wanna get rid of this or live this way or MASTER it?"
freddie,"Helen's house...all those girls walking around, the wives of ... . I want to fuck all of them."
master,Sex is not an aberration. Never has been. So what's wrong?
freddie,I want to fuck 'em all. I want to stick it in every one of them.
master,When did you forget that surviving was what you're supposed to do. Stick it in. Stick it in.
freddie,"I don't belong in here, man. I gotta get out of here..."
master,You belong at sea.
freddie,.hmph...
master,.You belong to Doris.
freddie,Why're you talking about her?
master,"You think of Doris. The loss of her. Triggers millions of little shocks and. charges, doesn't it? That present-life loss."
freddie,It was Val who let them in the house and told them who you were... Val did it.
mary sue,"Where's he going? What's he doing? MASTER sits on the bed, thinks. She leaves quickly, we hear her go down the hall and knock on ELIZABETH's door... ELIZABETH answers and the speak ...FREDDIE and MASTER look at each other;"
master,His mother was a paranoid schizophrenic who wanted to abort him. Right now he 'wants to be sick.' He's losing his war.
clark,He's done this before...
freddie,What happened?
clark,"He ran out of money and came back. He's a squirrel. He's trying to get to The Split Saber, don't you think? To sell it. Sell it off to any of these"
master,"There is a mission against time to be undertaken, Freddie."
norman conrad,Are you prepared to travel wherever we may ask you to go -- ?
freddie,Yes.
master,-- An assignment of importance in which more than just life hangs in the balance.
mary sue,-- I want to know if you can stop your boozing?
mary sue,Can you stop drinking?
master,"-- The drinking blocks the physical pain and dissolves treatment from working,"
mary sue,Let me be unambiguous: Tell me you won't drink.
freddie,I won't drink.
mary sue,"Your mission is to go to Phoenix, Arizona to prepare for a Universal Process Congress of the Cause."
norman conrad,.By bringing everyone together with the promise of unveiling new levels ... there will be interest from outside agencies ... the new works are of great many interests to dark forces...
freddie,Who?
mary sue,"CIA, Russians, Catholic Church. The list is long, Freddie."
norman conrad,"We don't expect trouble, but if it comes... we believe and trust that you are the right man for this mission."
elizabeth,"You're the only one that can do this, Freddie."
freddie,.What is Val doing in all this?
mary sue,He's a squirrel. And he has weaknesses.
norman conrad,Do you believe that no man can be neutral in the struggle between civilization and chaos?
freddie,Yes.
mary sue,Val's not a threat to you. You can handle Val. Can't you?
master,Freddie... there's something else...a side project I have for you...
master,.When you get there...I need you to get something for me ... something of great importance to me. MASTER When you arrive at the house ... you go underneath the house. There's a crawl space. In the center of the house is a small hole. You will see broken soil that marks the spot.. .dig it up. Inside is a box. I need you to take the box and protect it. You can take it to the First Phoenix Bank and register a safe deposit. There it can stay until my arrival...
freddie,What is it?
master,Valuables. Personal and confidential to me ...
master,As Guardian of the Good for this civilization and all it's neighboring galaxies ... . can you promise me that you will safely deliver and protect this box?
freddie,Yeah.
helen,Whatever you're doing... . it feels right. FREDDIE looks at her. She looks at him
dick,Good morning.
freddie,"Are you Dick Breton? I'm Freddie Sutton. You're expecting me... FREDDIE is very friendly, but focused on the task, he asks to use the phone to call Master - some place private, perhaps..."
master,Freddie.
freddie,Someone broke into the house.
master,.Someone broke into the house...
freddie,"Someone's been there. I don't know when. I may have just missed them - the front door was locked, I went in with the key and the house up ended, all smashed up on the ground - I walked to the back - the door was open -"
master,-- do you have the box?
freddie,Yes.
master,Where are you now?
freddie,I'm at the office with Dick Breton.
master,Is he there with you?
freddie,He's outside. The door's closed.
master,The box is safe in your hands?
freddie,Yes. It was right where you said it would be...I haven't opened it.
master,You've done well. You know the severity of what you hold in your hands -
freddie,Is...did...did Val break into the house looking for it?
master,"Possibly. A crazed lone lunatic for all we know. Certain atomic agencies wouldn't mind a crack at it, I'm sure."
freddie,What should I do now?
master,Get yourself a room at the Sun Inn Motel. The Sun Inn Motel ...it's nearby... acceptable accommodations.
freddie,It's good. I got it.
master,Yes it is. Are you alright?
freddie,"Yeah, yeah. I'm alright. I'm shaking.."
master,Why?
freddie,I don't know. It's hot down here.
master,You feel any stomach pain?
freddie,No.
master,Ringing in your ears?
freddie,No.
master,Left side feels good?
freddie,Yeah.
master,Right side feel good?
freddie,I'm alright.
master,"Good, good. Alright, soldier. Go to it. FREDDIE hangs up and looks at the DUFFLE BAG.. .he looks out into the front area... sees DICK BRETON and some other Phoenix Followers... they see Freddie.. .try to give him his space... He looks at the Duffle Bag."
freddie,Phoenix will be the home of the Universe Process Congress of the Cause.. .to be held June 5th to 9th... Everyone is excited.
follower,You're talking about Book II?
freddie,"Yes. This will be a unification Congress. All of us together - all branches and as many members as possible, organized in one city - for the presentation of all new levels."
freddie,"You don't have to change you faith or leave the congregation you belong to...So those interested in freedom are urged to please come for free sample processing sessions in being 'younger' feeling 'freer' and understanding where you come from... If every individual in the world had one other individual to whom he could go with his troubles and his ideas; and if he could tell that Other all about his troubles and ideas; and if that Other would listen AND understand, but not evaluate or invalidate or approve or give advice or in any other way try to control the thoughts of the speaker; the people of the world would become sane, well and happy."
freddie,"The key. Master takes it, pockets it... He looks down at his desk..."
master,"I'll need fresh ribbon tonight for the Old 'Vetti and paper, vanilla. Do. we have any?"
freddie,I'll get some.
master,We'll go to the bank in the morning. First thing?
freddie,Alright.
master,"Now that we've arrived, let's keep an extra eye open around the perimeter. We're not out of harm's way yet. MASTER leaves the room with Freddie behind..."
elizabeth,I hope that one day this place will be a museum to my father and everyone he has helped around the world will come and visit to see where he presented Book II. You did a wonderful job helping him...
freddie,.where's Clark?
elizabeth,Denver.
freddie,What's in Denver?
elizabeth,He had a mission there...
freddie,What kind of mission?
elizabeth,A secret one...
mary sue,Do you want some pancakes?
bill,"Hello, Freddie."
freddie,Bill.
bill,"Just dropped in to see Master, find out what's going on - guess I lost my invitation."
freddie,"There's nothing going on, Bill."
bill,What does that mean?
freddie,That's what that means.
bill,Does that mean I'm out? Am I in? What does that mean?
freddie,That's it.
bill,"Y'know that I've had no communications from this office for six weeks - no Journals, no answer's to my calls, I wrote a letter, was it received?"
freddie,Yes.
bill,"I'm mixed up slightly here. You know, when I worked for the Cause, I was made a nearly $800 in salary due me."
freddie,We appreciate that.
bill,"And as a Founding Member, I'm supposed to be a member for life?"
freddie,Yes.

freddie,No.
bill,But you're going to give them to me?
freddie,No.
bill,Then I suppose you're going to refund my money?
freddie,No.
bill,Why?
freddie,You're a dissenter. And an unfaithful woman.
freddie,I'm not embarrassed. That's sunburn.
bill,"I'm not going to let anyone tell me I can't have what I paid for, except Master. I want to see Master."
freddie,You can't see Master.
bill,Why?
freddie,Because he's busy and I'm not going to let you.
bill,Oh...it's Freddie-Barrier now? Why don't you hyphenate that?
master,"That's enough.. .now that's enough, you're going to make me red all over. . .thank you. Thank you. Book II is about Man."
elizabeth,Can we have some of your booze now?
freddie,"No more booze, Girl-y. Or haven't you heard?"
master,"The game is ""Pick A Point"" pick a point... and ride straight at it. as fast as you can. I'll go first. MASTER gets up on the bike. Picks a spot on the horizon."
