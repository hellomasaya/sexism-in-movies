Speaker,Dialogue
the fugitive, by  Jeb Stuart and David Twohy
roberts,Cancun. Nat just talked everybody into it...
nat,"No, no, no, no strings attached, Dr. Kimble. Industrial Hospital Supply has no ulterior motives."
kimble," ... But if you get any more Bulls tickets, Nat, give me a call."
kimble,"Hey, Jim."
nichols,"Richard, I just saw someone who wanted to meet you..."
lentz,"Dr. Kimble... Sorry, we've been trading phone calls last few days ... something about a biopsy report I returned to you?"
kimble, Yeah... Three. Livers appeared hepatetic to me.
lentz,I'll be in my office in the morning and I'll pull up the samples. Is that a good time for you?
kimble,Sure.
lentz," See you, Jim."
nichols," Before I forget, I went by the garage this afternoon and picket up the Ferrari. Thanks for the loaner again."
kimble,They fix it this time?
nichols,We'll see.
nichols,"You look fabulous, Helen."
nichols, We've got a court tomorrow at three.
kimble,"Well, I've seen everyone, can we leave?"
helen,"That would be a little abrupt, don't you think?"
helen," I'm sorry, I have to get my husband home."
helen,You looked handsome tonight...
kimble,Thank you...
helen,"Uh, huh... most men in a tuxedo look like waiters..."
kimble,But me?
helen,You looked more like... a band director.
helen,Are we home yet?...
kimble," When? Okay, tell them I'll be there in ten minutes."
kimble,Tim's got a problem.
helen,Call me on your way home.
kimble,Cavalry's here.
resident,"Patient is a male, forty-three. We pulled his gall bladder and the bleeding started."
kimble,What's his pro time?
resident, He's at 36 seconds. We got a major bleeder in here.
kimble,You talk to the family?
resident,None. He's off the street.
kimble, Okay... I'm clamping. Can he tolerate it?
anesthesiologist,He's a very sick guy.
kimble,Do we have a choice?
anesthesiologist,Go for it.
kimble,"Marie, give me a clamp..."
kimble," Your husband know you're here tonight, Marie?... What about this liver?"
resident,History's sketchy. Could be an alcoholic.
kimble,Who referred him?
kimble,"The wave of the future... Marie, you told Frank yet? Frank is so jealous of this late night thing we've got going here... This should hold him. Bleeding's stopped. Let's get a biopsy...  Send it downstairs and make sure you get Kath her slice."
surgeon,"You staying for the closing, Rich?"
kimble,No. I got a date.
surgeon,"Hey, Richard..."
surgeon,Thanks.
kimble,Hi. I'm five minutes away...
helen,I'm glad it went well. I'll see you in a minute.
kimble,I'm home. Did you hear who won the Bulls game?
kimble,Helen?
helen,He's trying to kill me...
helen, Richard... He's trying to kill me... my head.
kimble,"Hang on, babe... going to be all right."
helen,My head. Richard my hold me.
kimble,It was .38... I think. I only saw it for a second. I knocked it out of his hand.
kimble,Yes.
kimble,A .38 Smith.
detective kelly,"Did you have your key with you tonight, Dr. Kimble?"
kimble,What's going on here? This guy was trying to rob us.
kimble,You guys have got to be out of your minds. I didn't kill my wife!
detective kelly,"Let's start over, Dr. Kimble. What'd you have for breakfast?"
judge bennett,... and this case is a heater. It will not end up a bench trial...
gutherie,... We can't find this guy.
kimble,"I know what I saw, Walter."
gutherie,"I put you up on the stand to say what you saw without anything that remotely smells like proof and the State's attorney is going to take this one-armed man story and run it up our ass.  Look, Richard, you're paying us a lot of money to defend you... A plea to second degree -"
kimble,I didn't kill my wife.
detective kelly,"No forcible entry was found. From the beginning of the investigation, it did not appear to be a break-in. Nothing was missing."
forensics technician,"The defendant's prints were found on the neck, gun, bullets, and lamp... no other sets were fount other than the deceased."
prosecutor,Dr. Nichols. You are aware that Richard Kimble was the only beneficiary of Helen Kimble's estate. 12 million dollars roughly.
nichols,I was aware of that. The money meant nothing to him.
prosecutor,"Yet in your presence, Richard Kimble once said that 'if he had Helen's money he could find plenty of uses.' Did he not?"
nichols,We were talking about -
prosecutor,Yes or no?
coroner,The wound to the head caused a massive hemorrhage to the brain. It took from five to seven minutes for her to die...
kimble,... And I was holding her when the officers came in.
prosecutor,"How tall was this man, Dr. Kimble?"
kimble,"I can't be sure. We were, mostly on the floor, fighting... I couldn't -"
prosecutor,Did that fight cause the scratches on your face and arms?
kimble,No. As I explained -
prosecutor,And how did this man enter your house?
kimble,I don't know -
prosecutor,And you probably don't know why your wife told the emergency operator You were her attacker?
kimble,She didn't -
prosecutor,"Your name is Richard, isn't it? Your gun is a .38, isn't it? Your prints were on the gun, the bullets, the lamp, her neck, weren't they?"
kimble,Look...
prosecutor,Weren't they?
judge bennett,"After careful and studied review of all evidence presented during each phase of this proceeding, and because aggravated circumstances, detailed at length, were present the night of January 20th."
young guard,Jack! Feedin' time.
copeland,"Breathe, and you're first."
young guard,Suit yourself.
kimble,Look out!
old guard, You. You're a doctor. C'mere.
old guard,Do something.
kimble,He isn't going to make it unless he gets to a hospital. Fast.
old guard,ZL.
kimble,Just where the hell are we?
old guard,"Oh, shit..."
kimble,It's locked. Where're your keys?
kimble,Which one? This? This one?!
kimble,Help me get him -
copeland,"You listen to me. I don't give a damn which way you go, just don't follow me."
gerard,Good lord...
refro,What is this... a circus?
biggs,Point of impact.
gerard,"Biggs, your turn to babysit Newman."
biggs,Shit.  Come on.
gerard,How ya doing? Who's in charge?
trooper,Sheriff Rollins. Just follow the lights -
old guard,"... train was bearin' down on us, fast. I don't know how - it's still kind of hazy - but I grabbed him and pushed him out of the bus."
sheriff,You coulda both been killed.
old guard,"I know, but hell, he's my partner. Woulda done the same for me."
gerard,"Excuse me, Sheriff Rollins? Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard."
sheriff, I'll be with you in a minute.
sheriff, For the record. These three dead. And this one...
old guard,"Well, everything happened so fast...  Huh-uh. Don't think he made it."
sheriff,You get some rest.
sheriff,Looks like you came a long way for nothing. My men've already done a thorough search from point of impact and found nothing.
gerard,"With all due respect, may I suggest check-points starting at a 15-mile radius on I-57, I-24, Route 13 east of -"
sheriff,"Whoa, whoa, whoa... For what? Prisoners are all dead. The only thing check-points will do is get a lot of good people out here frantic and flood my office with calls."
gerard," Well, shit, Sheriff, I'd hate for that to happen... So, I'll be taking over the investigation."
sheriff,On whose authority?
gerard,"By authority of the Governor of the State of Illinois and the office of the United States Marshal, 5th District Northern Illinois..."
sheriff, Shut it down. Wyatt Earp is here to mop up for us.
gerard,"Please, ladies and gentlemen, step back and give this poor man some room."
gerard," Always an interesting thing when we find leg irons and no legs in them who held the keys, sir?"
old guard,"Uh, me."
gerard,"Would you be so kind as to show them to me, sir?"
gerard,Second chance.
old guard, He mighta got out.
gerard,Thank you.
sheriff,"What the hell is this? A minute ago you tell me he's part of the wreckage, now you're -"
gerard,Renfro - Take that bus apart. I want an accurate body count. Poole - Set up operations right here.
gerard,"Ladies and gentlemen... our fugitive's been on the run for ninety minutes. Average foot speed over uneven ground - barring injury is approximately four miles an hour, giving us a radius of six miles. I want a hard-target search of any residence, gas station, farmhouse, henhouse, doghouse and outhouse in that area. Check-points go up at 15 miles.  You got that? Good. Now, turn those damn things off and get out of our way."
poole,Blood trail found. Two miles southwest.
gerard, Newman...
newman,"Yes, sir..."
gerard,I need some coffee.
worker,"Hey, one's alive!"
kimble,"Can you hear me, sir?"
nurse,There's your fax...
duty nurse,"... Oh, you did a good job on this."
duty nurse," ... It does get dry in here, doesn't it?"
trooper,"'Scuse me, Doc?..."
trooper,... Don't know if you heard or not but we're looking for an escaped prisoner from that bus train wreck 'couple hours ago. Thought he might show up here if he was hurt.
kimble,What's he look like?
trooper," Approximately six one, 180 pounds, brown hair, brown eyes and beard."
trooper,... Seen anyone that fits that description?
kimble,Every time I look in the mirror ... but without the beard.
kimble,Excuse me...
trooper,Sure.
kimble,Here...
young guard,It's him... It's -

gerard,"Have Stevens go to Judge Rubin, he'll sign 'em."
biggs,"DeLange Hospital. Wounded guard swears to High Holy he saw Kimble right there in the hallway. Ambulance, missing too."
gerard,Give me a time.

gerard,"Turn around, hands over your head. And get down on the ground."
gerard,"Your choice, Kimble..."
gerard,Get down on your knees.
renfro, Son of a bitch...
head trooper,"Running out of daylight, Inspector."
gerard,"Lights and generators are coming, Captain."
head trooper,"Look, I don't mean to tell you your job, but maybe one person in a million could've survived that fall. The guy's fish food."
gerard,Then find me the fish that ate him.
helen,Good-bye. I love you.
kimble,Walter Gutherie please.
older waitress,Need to look at the menu?
kimble,"Some soup, please."
older waitress,Good choice.
older waitress,Need a ride?
kimble,Which way are you going?
renfro,Local officials were about to wet their pants to move in.
gerard,I bet they were.  Where's the woman?
renfro, Same room.
gerard," Okay... I'll take front. Biggs and Renfro, rear. Poole, handle support. I don't want anyone hurt. Stay outside unless called. Radios on three."
newman,"Uh, just want me to wait here, sir?"
gerard,"Hell, no. You're with me, Newman. Let's go."
gerard,U.S. Marshals. Down! Down!
copeland," You hear me? I said, I want out or I'll cut your man's throat!"
gerard,Shut up.
newman,My ear... I can't hear a thing out of it. I can't believe you did that!
gerard,"You think I should have bargained with him, don't you?"
newman,Yes. You could've missed! You could've killed me!
gerard,"Yeah, you're absolutely right. I could've."
gerard,How bad's your ear?
newman,Terrible. I probably have permanent hearing damage.
gerard,Let me see it.
gerard,I don't bargain.
kimble,Walter. It's Richard.
gutherie,"Richard... Jesus, why did you run? Running only makes you look guilty."
kimble,"I wasn't worrying about appearances, Walter."
gutherie,Tell me where you are. I'll come meet you so you can turn yourself in .
kimble,I'm not turning myself in. I need money.
gutherie,Richard. You're asking me to harbor and aid a convicted felon... I can't help you that way. My advice - both as a friend and as your legal counsel - is for you to give yourself up. Now tell me... where are you?
kimble, St. Louis.
gutherie,Give me an address. I'll be -
desk attendant,"See you tomorrow, Dr. Nichols?"
nichols,"Creature of habit, Sharon."
nichols,"Not today, please."
nichols,No. Not -
nichols," Oh, my God... Richard..."
kimble,"How're you doing, Charlie?"
nichols,You're alive...
kimble,Yeah. And I need your help.
nichols,Anything.
kimble,I need some money. Whatever you've got on you.
nichols,Of course.
nichols,Tell me where you're staying. I'll get you more money. Some clothes. Just give me an address...
kimble,I'll call you.
nichols,"I know why you came back - to find him. If I can help, call me... Call me."
kimble,"Thanks, Charlie..."
nichols,"Here, Richard, take my coat..."
cop," Hey, buddy - green light. Let's go."
poole,We've alerted St. Louis P.D
gerard,Call them back. Tell them you've made a mistake.
poole,What?
gerard, Stop it there.
gerard,Drop the voices.
gerard, Listen.
biggs,Trains? Traffic?
gerard,More... there's a voice in the background.
renfro,That's an El announcement.
gerard,"And there's no E1 in St. Louis. Ladies and gentlemen, Richard Kimble is in Chicago. Poole, get his artwork out to local police and have C.P.D. check the shelters... Biggs, bring in the detectives that handled his case."
stevens,I'll prepare the press release.
gerard,No.
gerard,They don't know he's alive and as far as Kimble knows we don't either. I want to keep it that way as long as we can. Are we clear?
renfro, Perfectly.
gerard,Noah... go to my office and let's officially take Dr. Kimble out of purgatory.
kelly,Police units have also increased patrols around homeless shelters and mass transit stations in the city.
flynn,"I ran his office for twelve years. Yes, we were very close. But he wouldn't come to me for help."
patient,Good morning.
kimble,Good morning.
roberts,"R.K.'s one smart, cold sonofabitch... He did her, no question."
gerard,"Gentlemen, I appreciate the cooperation of the Chicago police..."
salesman,"Did you say, 38/34?"
renfro,Was there anything in your initial investigation that would make you think Kimble would come back to Chicago.
rossetti,The man definitely has friends here.
gerard,What about lady friends?
kelly,Not that we found.
kelly,Right... You ever been downwind of a stockyard when the breeze is blowing? That's where we were sitting when Richard Kimble told that one...
nichols,He stopped me in my car. I gave him some money.
gerard,Where was this?
nichols,Outside our tennis -  - my tennis club.
gerard,Did he ask you for help?
nichols,I volunteered. He wouldn't accept it.
gerard,Why do you think he came back to Chicago?
nichols,He didn't tell me.
gerard,"I didn't ask you that, sir. I'm sure he was trying to protect you from having to lie for him."
gerard,"If you're really his friend, you'll help us bring him in unharmed."
nichols,"Why, so he can go back to prison? If you want help, gentlemen, you've come to the wrong man."
gerard,"Dr. Nichols, last year the U.S. Marshals' office closed out 11,003 warrants... 10,975 of those were captured. The twenty-eight others thought they were smarter than us... Now they're dead.  Nice car."
gerard,Stay on him.
woman doctor,Where's Rudy?
kimble,They said he's sick.
woman doctor,Didn't they tell you to put up the sign?
kimble,Uhhh. No they didn't.
woman doctor,Put up the 'wet floor' sign before someone gets hurt.
kimble, Asshole.
woman doctor,What did you say?
kimble,Nothing.
technician,"Sorry, I thought you were Ricky."
kimble, No... I've got to clean the blinds in the office. Want me to wait till you're finished?
technician,Naw... I'm going to be here all night. You won't bother me.
kimble,Fine.
anne,You find that sign?
kimble,"Yes, I did."
anne,You called me an asshole.
kimble,Excuse me. I was having a bad shift.
anne,You worked at other hospitals?
kimble,"Lots of them over the years. Here, long ago. Hasn't changed much."
anne,I bet it hasn't. See you.
punk kid, Hey. Hey! I know that guy!
anne,What happened?
orderly,A bus flipped off the overpass. Got at least twenty more coming in.
anne,What about this one here?
orderly,Fractured sternum. X-ray's coming up.
anne,"Okay, we've got to get some room in this hallway, people."
anne,"Hey, take this one up the hall to Critical Care."
kimble,Hey. Hey!
kimble,They just sent this one up.
surgeon,"Bob! Get this one into room four, stat."
anne,"Gladys, where's the boy I sent down with the janitor?"
gladys,What boy?
anne,The one with the fractured sternum.
gladys,He never came in here.
kimble,Wrong...
anne,"Dave, did you see a janitor come up here earlier?"
surgeon,"Yeah, he brought a kid up.  Anne, did you write the orders? I couldn't make out the signature..."
anne,I saw -
surgeon, Whoever did knew what the hell he was doing. Kid's a hair away from a ruptured aorta.
kimble,"Seventy-five. Hell, yes."
kimble,What else?
kimble,What do you mean?
anne,I saw you looking at that boy's chest film.
kimble,It's a hobby of mine -
anne,What other hobbies do you have? Brain surgery?
kimble,What do you want?
anne,I want to know how that kid ended up in surgery.
kimble,I'm a janitor. I did what I was told.
anne,Bullshit. Who changed those orders?
anne,You stand right here. I'm calling security.
gerard,A man posing as a janitor orders an emergency operation and all you do is pull his I.D.?
anne, A little boy's alive today because he did something.
gerard,"So, you weren't aware that when he escaped he was being transported to Menard State Prison to begin a term of life imprisonment."
anne,For what?
gerard,For murdering his wife.
gerard,"Thank you for your help, Doctor."
renfro,"What I can't figure is, if you were Kimble, why'd you take a major league chance of hanging around a trauma ward?"
renfro,The place would be crawling with cops.
man,Can I help you find something?
gerard,"Thank you, sir, I think you already have."
kimble,"Yes... This is Dr. Elway at Cook County. I'm doing follow-up work for the Prosthetic Clinic on Matthew Zelick...  He did... I'm terribly sorry. No, I'll correct our files. Thank you."
gerard,The onearmed man. Missing the right or left hand?
poole,Right.
gerard,Location of the attachment.
poole, Mid-humerus.
kimble,No kidding?... Armed robbery.  He's where?
renfro,It could take us a week to track down every one of those names.
gerard, Stevens... I've got a list of names I want searched for criminal history.
elevator cop, Comin' or not?
cops,"Aw, shit... Not now... Anybody bring a deck of cards?"
clearing officer, Booth Three. No hands on the glass. Five minutes maximum. Be advised that under a Federal court ruling your conversation can be recorded. Next.
clearing officer,Name of inmate?
kimble,Clive Driscoll.
clearing officer,"Sign here, print your name, address, and relationship to inmate below.  Be about five minutes. You can wait in the hall."
gerard, We need to see a prisoner.
desk clerk,Fifth floor.
biggs,It's hinky. Man risks everything to find a man his own investigators say doesn't exist. Something's really hinky about this thing.
gerard,I hate that word.
clearing officer,Visitor for Driscoll...?
clearing officer,Booth seven. No hands on the glass. Be advised...
driscoll,So who are you?
kimble,Sorry. I made a mistake.
driscoll,"Shit, that's okay. Stick around a few minutes, talk about whatever you want..."
driscoll,"... They're not exactly wired for cable downstairs, y'know?"
gerard,Where're the damn stairs?
biggs,It's five flights!
gerard,Then you wait.
gerard, Kimble.
gerard,Kimble!
kimble,Officers - there's a man in the stairwell waving a gun and screaming.
gerard,"U.S. Marshal! Get on the phone, call your commander, tell him there's a top-fifteen warrant in the building. Go."
gerard,Kimble. Stop!
gerard,Down. down. everybody down!
gerard,Kimble. Stop!
gerard,Open the doors!
nichols,Richard... Alex Lentz.
secretary,U.S. Marshal's office...
secretary,It' 9 Kimble on line three.
gerard,"Renfro, Biggs..."
gerard,This is Gerard.
gerard,"You told me, you didn't kill your wife."
kimble,Remember what you said to me?
gerard,I remember you were pointing my gun at me.
technician, He's on the southside.
gerard,"That's right, Kimble... I'm not trying to solve a puzzle here. I'm just the poor working man that's paid to hunt you down."
renfro, He's in Pullman area... Fifteen seconds for location.
kimble,"Well, I am trying to solve the puzzle, Gerard and I just found a piece."
technician,Three seconds.
gerard," You can't control this thing, Kimble... Kimble?"
gerard, Where is he?
renfro, Holy shit. We've got a car there right now.
kimble,This an R.D.U.90 patient?
forensic tech,"Inspector, we're ready for you to look at this."
forensic tech,"Kimble's prints are all over the apartment, but the concentration is here."
forensic tech,He flips through the pack but paused here.
gerard,Let me see the negatives.
gerard,One's missing.
sykes,What the hell's going on here? Who are you people?
gerard,"You had a break-in, Mr. Sykes."
sykes,You a cop?
gerard,My name is Gerard. U.S. Marshal's Office.
gerard,This morning a fugitive named Richard Kimble made a call from your apartment.
sykes,Richard Kimble... I don't know a Richard Kim -
sykes,Wait a minute... This is the doctor who killed his wife... He claimed the killer had a prosthetic limb. You telling me he's coming after me?
gerard,Would he have a reason to?
sykes,What the hell's that supposed to mean? Because I have this?
sykes,"Look, a year ago some people came to see me. They asked me questions about the night of the murder and I'll tell you the same thing I told them. I wasn't even in town then. I was on a business trip."
gerard,"What kind of business are you in, Mr. Sykes?"
sykes,Security.
gerard,Independent?
sykes,"No, I work for a pharmaceutical company. I handle security for its top executives."
gerard,Any idea why Kimble would be interested in these?
sykes,No. Just some doctors on a company junket.
sykes," Look, you mind if I talk to the cops to see if anything's missing?"
gerard,By all means.
renfro,"He's pulling our chain, Sam. If this was the guy Kimble was looking for, why call us?"
gerard,"Kimble said he's putting together a puzzle. We don't need to put it together too, we just need to be there when he gets to the next piece."
gerard,Keep somebody on him. If he moves I want to know.
operator," I'm sorry sir, Dr. Nichols is at a medical conference at the Hilton."
kimble,It's very important I reach him.
assistant,"I'm sorry, sir, they said it was an emergency."
kimble, Can you talk?
nichols, Richard. Yes... I'm on a hotel phone. What's going on?
kimble,"I found him, Charlie. I found the guy that killed Helen."
nichols, What?
kimble,"It's all about a drug, Charlie. They tried to kill me because of a drug."
nichols,Who?
kimble,Devlin-MacGregor and Lentz. Lentz was supervising the R.D.U.90 protocol. He knew I'd found out the drug had problems. It's Lentz.
nichols,"Richard, Lentz is dead. He died in an auto accident last summer."
nichols,Can you prove this about the drug?
kimble,I need your help. Call Mr. Roosevelt and tell him I'm coming in.
renfro,If you were Richard Kimble... Why would you hunt for a one-armed man you think killed your wife; find hint then leave him and call us?
poole,To throw us off his trail.
renfro,Unless... What if you were a well respected surgeon and wanted to kill your wife? How would you do it?
biggs,I'd hire a pro. Sight unseen.
poole,Set it up to look like a robbery gone bad.
renfro,How would you find him? Look in the phone book?
renfro,Through a connection.
poole,Maybe through a company you did some business with.
biggs,Like a pharmaceutical company. Someone in security.
newman,"On the night of his wife's murder, Kimble attended a hospital benefit sponsored by Devlin-Macgregor Pharmaceutical - Sykes' company."
biggs,But Sykes claims he was out of town.
poole,And company records support that he was on a business trip.
renfro,That's an easy fix. So let's say he was in town. Did the job. Everything goes as planned with one problem.
newman,"Instead of looking like a robbery gone bad, Kimble ends up being the one accused..."
biggs,"... tried, convicted..."
poole,... and the hit man gets away clean.
renfro,So Kimble returns to hunt for and find the hit man.
newman,Why? To share the blame? He'd still go to prison.
renfro,You're underestimating the power of the good doctor. It would be his word against... Sykes'. Who would you believe?
biggs,So what does Kimble do next?
renfro,Get help.
gerard,"Stevens, check phone records for Sykes and Kimble."
gerard,Find out who this guy is.
newman, Why do I get all the great jobs?
roosevelt,"It sure is good to see you again, Dr. Kimble."
kimble,"You too, Roosevelt... Been a long time."
roosevelt,This is the R.D.U.90 file and samples. Dr. Nichols said you needed.
kimble,"Thanks, Roosevelt."
sykes,"I want to report a fire; No, it's not my place, it's a couple doors down."
wahlund," Oh, my God... Richard."
kimble,"I loaned you something once, Kath, and I need them back."
nichols,Mr. Gerard.
gerard,Doctor. Could I have a minute?
renfro,He's a security specialist at Devlin-Macgregor Pharmaceuticals.
nichols,"I don't know him. You're getting pretty desperate aren't you, Mr. Gerard. I told you, you wouldn't find Richard."
gerard," Dr. Kimble hasn't come back to you for help, has he?"
nichols,No. And it seems like we've been over this ground before. Now if you'll excuse me.
gerard,Dr. Nichols. Do you know the other man in the photograph?
nichols,I never saw him before.
renfro, I bet they line up to hear that one.
kimble,"Half the people in the study were indigents. No follow-up, no baseline on them. Who could say they didn't come into the study with bad livers?"
wahlund,The one on the right is one of the samples you sent me. It shows a lot of perriportal inflammation loaded with eosinophils. When you see that with the accumulation of bile it's a classic for -
kimble,- drug induced hepatitis.
wahlund,I'm impressed. Now look at this.
wahlund,"According to the study, this is a slice from the same liver."
kimble,Cold normal.
wahlund,Clearly not from the same tissue. In fact.
wahlund,See this small area of bile duct proliferation? Von Meyenberg's Complex. Occurs in only 2% of the population. But it's in every one of your five samples.
kimble,That's statistically impossible.
wahlund,That's because they're all from the same liver.
betty,His name's Lentz. A pathologist. I only remember him because he died last summer.
newman,Anybody down in pathology who might know something about the guy?
betty,"It's kinda late to catch anyone, but you might go by the morgue. There's an old guy down there who's been around forever."
biggs,Just what I want to do before dinner.
newman,Are you Mr. Roosevelt?
roosevelt,Yes.
biggs,"We're United States Marshals. We're trying to find out some information about a pathologist, named Lentz. He used to be on staff here."
roosevelt,He's dead.
newman,"Yeah, we heard. We wanted to know if he knew or had any contact with Dr. Richard Kimble?"
roosevelt,I... I haven't seen Dr. Kimble.
newman," That's not what I asked, sir. I just wanted to know if Dr. Kimble and Dr. Lentz knew each other?"
roosevelt,"I... I don't know. Excuse me, I got to go."
biggs,I think you're lying to us.
kimble,They'd be home free if I hadn't been leaning on them to account for the livers I was seeing. And I wouldn't have seen the livers if I hadn't told the guys on my service to call me when they had cases that were bleeding excessively in surgery.
wahlund,"Big bucks. One schmuck standing in the way. Easy, get rid of him and his wife. But why Lentz?"
kimble,"Why not? He's one of the original patent holders. Toss the samples I sent, replace them with healthy samples, issue the path report on the healthy stuff-piece of cake."
kimble,When did Lentz die?
wahlund,"Oh, last summer sometime. August... Why?"
kimble,Because a good third of the samples Lentz approved were signed after he died.
kimble,Someone else used Lentz's name.
wahlund,A pathologist at Devlin-Macgregor?
kimble,They wouldn't have had the access. They would have needed someone at the hospital.
wahlund,Where are you going?
kimble,To see an old friend.
poole,It's Newman. Line two.
newman,The old guy didn't know where he was going. But he picked up some tissue samples.
gerard,Tissue samples?
newman,... From a drug study. And signed for by Dr. Charles Nichols.
newman,Nichols also knew Lentz. He was a pathologist.
renfro,He was covering for Kimble.
gerard, Get CPD to bring in Sykes.
host,"Tonight to close our conference, we're honored to hear a report from one of the most respected men in his field..."
host,... He is the A. Jude Robinson Fellow and Administrative Chief of Pathology at Chicago Memorial Hospital... and just recently has been appointed member of the board of directors for Devlin-Macgregor Pharmaceuticals. Please welcome...
host,... Dr. Charles Nichols.
stevens,I checked Sykes' calls for the last two years against Kimble's like you asked and found nothing.
gerard,All right. It was a thought.
stevens,But when I cross-checked Kimble's phone records... one came up.
gerard,Kimble called Sykes.  Renfro! Get C.P.D. to bring in Sykes!
stevens,Night of his wife's murder - seven-thirty in the evening from his car.
stevens,I have the phone record right here.
gerard," No, Stevens... I believe you."
poole,"Sam, C.P.D. just checked Sykes' apartment. He's not there."
sykes,"Back up. Move to the door, Doc."
transit cop," This is transit unit, 23. I have a possible sighting of Richard Kimble. Northbound coming into the Balbo station. Request immediate back-up at the station."
sykes,"This is my stop, Doc."
kimble,"Good, it's my stop, too."
transit cop,"Kimble.  Sir, move away from him."
sykes,Go ahead. You don't have it in you .
kimble,"Not as easy as Helen, was it?  You missed your stop."
renfro,Balbo station. That's -
gerard," Poole, get Biggs and Newman."
gerard, Damn...
newman,C.P.D. just reported -
gerard,I heard. Was it Kimble?
biggs,"Conflicting reports, but the cops are considering him a shooter."
police captain,Witnesses say he entered hotel from the subway.
kelly,Okay. I want it locked down. Start on the lower levels.
gerard,"That's my man in there, Kelly."
kelly,"Not since he took down one of ours, Gerard. This is a police matter, now. Stay, the hell, out of it."
gerard,"C'mon, I know where he's going."
nichols,... And I especially would like to thank my researchers who helped me...
nichols,Richard...
kimble,"What's wrong, Charlie? Surprised?"
crowd,It's Richard. It's Kimble.
kimble,"After Lentz died, you were the only one that had access to the pathology reports."
nichols,Reports? What are you?
kimble,You switched the samples and falsified the reports so R.D.U.90 could get approval.
nichols,"Richard, I don't know what you're talking about?..."
kimble,I have a set of the original samples.
kimble,"You almost pulled it off, Charlie. But I know all about it now, and I can prove it."
kimble,"Ladies and gentlemen. My friend, as you can see, is obviously not well. Richard, if you want to talk -"
kimble,I didn't come here to talk
biggs,"C.P.D. has the perimeter, hotel security has the parking structure."
gerard,"Let them keep busy down below. Newman, get with security. See if you can locate Kimble from the monitors. Keep in radio contact."
nichols,"Your best quality, Richard, is that you don't give up -"
nichols,... even when it's clearly in your best interest to...
nichols,I always knew that I'd have to kill you.
nichols,"Now, I must thank you for giving me 200 witnesses tonight who will support me... when I tell them it was self-defense..."
kimble,"You missed your chance, Charlie..."
newman, I've got Kimble on the roof with Nichols. Southeast exit.
biggs, Keep and eye on him. Biggs has roof plans.
biggs,There are four exits to the roof.
gerard,I want them covered.
kimble,You took everything away from me... for money.
gerard,This way.
kimble,"I want to know, Charlie... was it worth it...?"
nichols,"This thing is bigger than even you think, Richard. You can't stop it."
gerard, Get that door open.
gerard, Stay at this door.
kelly,Bring him down.
gerard, This is a United States Marshal. Get that helicopter out of here!
renfro,There is a U.S. Marshal out there. Hold your fire!
gerard,Kimble!
gerard, Where did the elevator stop?
newman, Level five.
gerard,Get out of here.
gerard, We're going in. Give me five minutes. Keep C.P.D. out.
gerard,... There is no way out of here.
gerard,... Nichols borrowed your car the night of the murder and called Sykes from it.
gerard,... That's why there was no forced entry at your house. He'd used your keys.
gerard,Kimble... Come meet me out here.
gerard,"It's time to quit running... if you don't, you know I'll stop you. He listens, there is no answer."
another reporter,... there are unconfirmed reports from police of new evidence which may exonerate Kimble while implicating some of the biggest names in medicine...
stunned doctor,He just walked in... We didn't know what he was going to do. My wife was very frightened... The next thing I knew cops were charging in and...
reporter,"Dr. Kimble, is it true you can prove your innocence!"
gerard, Get them back.
biggs,"Watch your head, Dr. Kimble."
gerard, Give me your hands.
gerard,"Take care of those hands, Doc, you're going to need them again soon."
kimble,I thought you told me 'you didn't care.'
gerard,"Yeah, well, don't spread it around."
