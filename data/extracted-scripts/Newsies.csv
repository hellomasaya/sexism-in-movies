The boys begin to wake,                          KID BLINK yawning, stretching,                HEY BUMMERS, WE GOT WORK TO DO complaining as they hit the floor: pants pulled                         SPECS on, suspenders hitched             SINCE WHEN DID YOU BECOME up, boots laced tight.

mush,"How'd you sleep, Jack? JACK On me back, Mush."
crutchy,"Jack, this look like I'm fakin' it? He hobbles towards Jack on one crutch."
jack,Who says you're fakin' it?
crutchy,"The streets are fulla fakes these days -- it's hurtin' the rep of genuine articles like myself. I gotta find me a new sellin' spot, where they ain't used to seein' me. Jack smiles; Mush taps Crutchy on the arm... sings. MUSH TRY BOTTLE ALLEY OR THE HARBOR"
racetrack,"TRY CENTRAL PARK IT'S GUARANTEED JACK TRY ANY BANKER, BUM OR BARBER Jack rinses his face, takes                  SKITTERY             * special care adjusting his      THEY ALMOST ALL KNOWS HOW TO red bandana.                      READ KID BLINK I SMELL MONEY"

david,"Les, hurry up, willya? Why do I gotta be saddled with you?"
les,Why do I gotta be saddled with you?

jack,"Better choke it, Blink -- 'fore you need another patch. KID BLINK Hey, who ya sellin' wit, Jack? CRUTCHY Not wit you! JACK Nothing personal, Blink, but..."
jack,"IT TAKES A SMILE AS SWEET AS BUTTER CRUTCHY THE KIND THAT LADIES CAN'T As Jack sings, the boys             RESIST listen carefully. They all respect his opinion.                       RACETRACK IT TAKES AN ORPHAN WITH A STUTTER"

david,"Watch it, willya? What do you think you're doing!"
jack, Runnin'.
boots,"Ride 'em, cowboy!"
weasel,You know my name -- it's Weisel. Mister Weisel to you. How many?
jack,"Don't rush me -- I'm perusin'                          * the mercandice... Mr. Weasel.                          * The Newsies love it as Jack deliberately takes a paper, turns and scans.  Seeing Les staring at him, Jack winks. Les smiles back, fascinated. Jack turns back to Weasel with a fifty-cent piece. JACK The usual. Weasel grabs for the coin -- Jack flips it out of his            * grasp and onto the counter. The Newsies whoop. WEASEL Hundred for the wiseguy -- next!                       *"
weasel,Ya got ya papes -- move outta here.                    * DAVID I paid for twenty -- you only gave                     * me nineteen! 
david,"I want that other paper. The Delanceys start for David when suddenly Jack steps                 * up, slams his hand on David's papers, closes his eyes                  * and does a flip-count. The expert.                                     * JACK Nineteen, Weasel. An honest mistake -- on account of Oscar                            * can't count to twenty with his                            * shoes on.                                                 * Weasel glowers -- but wants to get back to business.         He backhands Morris who looks surprised. WEASEL Next! JACK Hold it.   Race -- spot me two-bits. Race flips him a coin.     Jack slaps it on the counter. JACK Another fifty for my friend here. DAVID I don't want another fifty -- ! JACK  Sure you do. Every newsie wants more papes."
david,"These papers are yours, I don't                           * take charity from nobody! I don't                         * even know who you are --"
les," Les. This is David, he's my brother. He's older."
jack,"Sixty-forty.   Or I forget the whole t'ing. David reluctantly offers his hand. Jack spits in his palm and shakes. Les whoops and they move off, Jack already being the mentor -- JACK The name of the game is volume, Dave. You only took twenty papes -- why?"
david,"Bad headline...? JACK First t'ing you gotta learn -- headlines don't sell papes, newsies sell papes. We're what holds this town together -- without newsies, nobody knows nuttin'! They move away from Newsie Square as above them, the GOLDEN DOME OF THE WORLD BUILDING glistens in the morning sun."
seitz,"Just the Newsies, Chief, I'll --"
seitz,"Creating the World, Chief.                             *"
pulitzer,"This paper's losing money because there's too much fat, inefficiency -- not because I'm fighting to                         * make us number one! Well, we're going to cut costs, maximize profits -- and still beat the socks off Hearst --  I want to know how by tonight."
jack,"Some newsies got corners, see -- same spot, same customers. Me,                         * I like to keep moving, enjoy the life of the big city. I spot an opportunity, I sell a pape. That's the advantage of being an independent businessman, instead                       * of workin' for wages.                                  *"
david,"Paper, mister? Without breaking the kiss, the man kicks out at David who jumps away. Shaking his head, Jack whispers something to Les, who rushes over to the Lovers, still kissing."
les, Extry -- 'Runaway Carriage Crushes Cop!'
les,He gimme a dime! He said I should go far away and keep the change!
david,"What -- ?   Where's that story -- ? JACK  Page nine -- thank you, sir. Nextry, 'Thousands flee in panic -- '"
david, 'Trash fire near immigration building frightens seagulls -- ?'
jack,"'Terrified flight from flaming inferno!' Thank you, much obliged -- "
les,"Buy me last pape, mista...?"
jack,Mine taught me not to starve. So we both got an education.
david,"You just make things up -- like those headlines. JACK I don't do nothin' the guys who write this stuff don't do. It ain't lyin' -- it's just improvin' the truth a little. Les comes running back, wiping his mouth, with a quarter. LES The guy gave me a quarter! Quick, gimme some more last papers! DAVID  Hold it -- I smell beer! LES The guy bet me I wouldn't drink some -- that's how I made the quarter!"
jack,"Hey, no drinkin' on the job -- it's bad for business. What if somebody called a cop or somethin'?"
jack,"Beat it -- the bulls! He races off. David, confused, races after him, Les looks very worried as he runs with David --"
les,Just for one little sip of beer -- ?
les, One sip! I didn't even swallow it! Jack leads them into the doorway of --
snyder,You young miscreant! Wait'll I get you back to the Refuge!
david,The Refuge -- ? 
david,"I'm not crossing that! Anyway, I don't think they're chasing us --"
les,You were in jail...?   Why?
jack,"I was starvin'. I stole some food. DAVID  Yeah, food. My name's Kelly, Jack Kelly, like I told you. Think I'm lyin'? DAVID You have a way of 'improving the truth.' Why was he chasing you?"
jack,Because I escaped. LES 
jack,"This is David and Les. And this is the greatest star of the vaudeville stage today, Miss Medda Larkson, the Swedish Meadowlark. MEDDA  Welcome! JACK Medda also owns the joint."
medda, I won't. I promise.
medda,"This kid is good. Speaking as one professional to another, I'd say you got a future."
jack,"Okay if we hang here awhile, Medda? 'Til a little problem outside goes away?"
medda,"As long as you like -- now the lark must warble. Hey, you --  -- give my guests whatever they want."
medda, 'MY LOVEY-DOVEY BABY'... etc.
jack,"That's Sante Fe -- out in New Mexico? Soon's Pop finds us the right ranch, they're sendin' for me. LES  Then you'll be a real cowboy..."
david,Why don't we divvy up at my place...? You can meet my folks...
david,"Jack -- let's get outta here -- ! The boys move away, Jack looking back at the beating. JACK Maybe tomorrow we get a decent headline."
esther, My God...! What happened?
david,"He's just sleeping, Momma --"
mayer,You made all this selling papers...? 
mayer,"Esther -- maybe David's partner would like to stay for dinner. Add some more water to the soup. ESTHER  Mayer...! Mayer laughs, joined by Sarah and David -- and finally Esther herself as she waters the soup. Jack stands drinking in the family's warmth."
mayer,That many...? JACK More when the headline's good.
sarah,What makes a headline good?
jack," 'Scuse the language there, uh, maybe I'm talkin' too much..."
mayer," You talk fine, Jack -- Sarah, get that cake your mother's been hiding in the cabinet! ESTHER That's for your birthday tomorrow! MAYER I've had enough birthdays!    This is a celebration! David leaps up to fetch silver; Sarah gets a luscious chocolate cake from a cabinet -- DAVID It's only the beginning -- the longer I work, the more I'll make -- MAYER You work only until I go back to the factory! Then you go back to school, like you promised."
les," 'Gimme all ya got, baby...'"
jack,How'd your pop get hurt? DAVID The factory. An accident.  He's no good to them anymore so they just fired him. He's got no union to protect him.
mayer,"David?   Time to come in now. Jack looks in at the warm family tableau: the lullaby, Sarah reading to Mayer. David, going in, sees his friend's expression. DAVID Why don't you stay here tonight...? JACK I got my own place... but thanks.                      * Your family's real nice, Dave.                         *                                           * Like mine.                                             * David nods, climbs in the window.                                 * DAVID See you tomorrow. Carryin' the banner."
jack, Carryin' the banner.
jack,"SO THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL A FAMILY MOTHER, DAUGHTER; FATHER, SON GUESS THAT EVERYTHING YOU HEARD ABOUT IS TRUE "
kloppman,"You missed your supper, boys."
racetrack,"Then we didn't miss much, did we?                     * "
jonathan,"Actual income, as well as projected income, against actual operating costs, as well as projected operating costs, produce a reduced marginality of profit which in turn --"
pulitzer,Seitz!   What in blazes is he talking about?
seitz,"Says you need to make more money, Chief. "
pulitzer,Then Hearst undersells me and I'm in the poorhouse. Brilliant.
jonathan,"Not the customer price -- the price to the distribution apparatus. Exasperated, Pulitzer looks to Seitz for a translation. SEITZ You mean the Newsies...? Charge the Newsies more for their papers? Bad idea, Chief. JONATHAN Very well. My next proposal -- salary cuts, particularly those at the very top -- PULITZER Wait. What  do the Newsies pay now -- fifty cents per hundred papers? If  you raised it to sixty cents --"
jonathan,A mere tenth of a cent per paper --
pulitzer,"-- then that, multiplied by forty thousand papers a day, seven days a week -- well, it would pay some of the bills around here."
seitz,"Chief, if you do this, every Newsie we got will head straight for Hearst."
seitz,"What about the other papers -- ? PULITZER If we do it, they'll all do it. It's only a tenth of a cent -- nobody gets hurt! It's good for the Newsies -- an incentive, make 'em work harder, sell more papers! Now get me Hearst on that contraption. Seitz sighs and reaches for the phone."
jack,"Awright, pipe down! Don't you see it's a gag? Just Weasel bein' a weasel. Joke's over, Wease. Gimme a hunnerd. He plops fifty cents on the counter.      Weasel's grin gets weaselier as he slides it back."
weasel,"Hunnerd'll cost ya sixty, Cowboy. JACK I ain't payin' no sixty -- WEASEL Then move outta the way -- JACK You bet -- I move right over to the Journal."
racetrack,"It's the same at the Journal -- we checked -- it's the same everywhere! JACK Why the jack-up, Weasel? WEASEL Why not? It's a nice day. Why don't you ast Mr. Pulitzer? He whacks the bell with his cudgel; the Delanceys stir threateningly. WEASEL If you ain't buyin' papes, clear out! World employees only on this sida the gates. JACK It stinks here anyway -- let's go!"
kid blink,They can't do that to us -- RACETRACK They can do what they want -- it's their stinkin' paper -- BOOTS Ain't we got no rights -- ?
crutchy,Sure -- we got the right to take it in the t'roat!
racetrack,"It's a rigged deck -- why waste time kiddin' ourselves? They set the price, we gotta pay it -- MUSH We got no choice! So let's get our lousy papes while they still got some -- JACK Nobody's goin' anywhere -- they ain't gonna get away with this! EVERYBODY What can we do -- "
les,Stop crowding him!    Let him think!
jack,"One thing for sure. If we don't sell papes, then nobody sells papes. Nobody comes through those gates 'til they put the price back where it was. "
jack,"Yeah, a strike -- good idea, Dave."
david," No, I didn't mean -- we can't strike, we're not a union --"
jack,"We go on strike, we're a union, right? Keep it comin', Dave --"
david,"Nooo! Stop and think, willya?     You can't just rush everybody into this!"
jack,"Dave's right again! We gotta think this through! Old man Pulitzer and Hearst and all them other rich geezers, they run this city. Do we really think a buncha streetrats like us would have a chance against people like them? "
les,Strike!
david,"Uh... they can't treat us like we don't exist... SONG:   ""THE WORLD WILL KNOW""   APPROXIMATE TIME: 3:30. JACK PULITZER AND HEARST THEY THINK WE'RE NOTHING ARE WE NOTHING? NEWSIE NO! DAVID If we stick together like the trolley workers, they can't break us up. JACK PULITZER AND HEARST THEY THINK THEY GOT US DO THEY GOT US? NEWSIES NO! "
boots,What's to stop someone else from sellin' our papes?
jack,We talk to 'em. RACETRACK Some of 'em don't hear so good. JACK Then we soak 'em.
david,No! JACK WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE TO STOP THE WAGONS? ARE WE READY? NEWSIES YEAH! DAVID No! We can't beat up kids in the street! It'll destroy what we're trying to do! JACK WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE Jack's not listening now.          TO STOP THE SCABBERS? CAN WE DO IT?
newsies,YEAH! JACK WE'LL DO WHAT WE GOTTA DO UNTIL WE BREAK THE WILL OF MIGHTY BILL AND JOE 
all,"AND THE WORLD WILL... JACK Jack and the others jump       PULITZER MAY OWN THE down from the wagon and with   WORLD BUT HE DON'T OWN US! David and Les following, move across the square.                     ALL PULITZER MAY OWN THE WORLD BUT HE DON'T OWN US! JACK PULITZER MAY CRACK THE WHIP BUT HE WON'T WHIP US! The Newsies answer back.                    ALL PULITZER MAY CRACK THE WHIP BUT HE WON'T WHIP US! Crossing the square, as                       ALL they move towards the gates,   AND   THE WORLD WILL KNOW singing up to Pulitzer's       AND   THE WORLD WILL LEARN office in the dome at the      AND   THE WORLD WILL WONDER top of The World Building.     HOW   WE MADE THE TABLES TURN "
all,AND THE OLD WILL FALL The Newsies interlock arms           AND THE YOUNG STAND TALL forming a chain of                   AND THE TIME IS NOW resistance and solidarity.           AND THE WINDS WILL BLOW AND OUR RANKS WILL GROW AND GROW AND GROW AND SO THE WORLD WILL FEEL THE FIRE AND FIN'LLY KNOW!
jack,"Bumlet, Specs, Skittery take Queens; Pie Eater and Snotty, the East side -- Snipeshooter, go with 'em; okay, who wants Brooklyn? Spot Conlon's territory?"
denton,What's going on? DAVID They're going in to present our demands to Pulitzer. DENTON What demands? 
denton,"I'm Denton, New York Sun.   What's your name?"
david, David...
denton,David.  As in David and Goliath?  You really think old man Pulitzer's going to listen to your demands? DAVID He has to.
jack, Real hoity-toity --
les,That's when they threw us out. DENTON Doesn't it scare you going up against the most powerful man in New York? JACK  My name really gonna be in the papers? DENTON Any objections?
jack,"Not as long as you get it right -- Kelly, Jack Kelly. And, Denton? No pictures."
boots,Spent a month there one night.
david,This Spot Conlon... is he really as bad as they say...?
spot,So I'm hearin' things from little birdies in Harlem and Queens and all over. They're chirpin' in my ear: 'Jackie-boy's Newsies are playin' like they're goin' on strike -- '
david, We're not playing -- we are on strike -- it's --
spot,"What's this, Jackie boy?   Some kind of walkin' mouth? "
spot,So they told me. And what did they tell you? David looks nervously at the circling henchmen. DAVID That... they're all waiting to see what Spot Conlon does. That you're the key...  That Spot Conlon is the most respected and... famous... newsie in New York... and probably everywhere else...
david,"And... if Spot Conlon joins the strike, they'll join and we'll be unstoppable so you gotta join and ... well... you gotta... He trails off.    Spot nods, turns to Jack."
spot,"You're right. Brains.  But I got brains, too -- and more than half-a-one. How do I know you punks won't run the first time some goon comes atcha with a club? How do I know you're in it to win?"
spot,"Not good enough, Jackie-boy.   You gotta show me."
jack,"Maybe you lost your guts, Spotty- boy --  Show me this strike ain't just some kids do-or-dare, then we'll talk."
racetrack,So where's Spot Conlon?
kid blink,"Without Spot and the others, there ain't enough of us... MUSH Maybe we're movin' too soon, maybe we ain't ready -- SKITTERY Definitely should put this off a coupla days, definitely -- PIE EATER Hey, Jack -- you ready?   I'm ready! He's swinging a picket sign."
jack,At least somebody's got the right idea. PIE EATER Who else is ready for stick-ball? He tears the sign off the stick and swings it like a bat. JACK Who we kiddin' here. Spot was right. Just a game to these guys...
crutchy,"Hey, Jack -- get a loada this!"
david,"OPEN THE GATES AND SEIZE THE DAY As David sings,                 DON'T BE AFRAID AND DON'T DELAY the others join in.

jack,The House of Refuge... my home- sweet-home... 
david,How can you be sure they sent Crutchy here?
jack,"Whattayasay, Tenpin.   You got a new guy, Crutchy --"
tenpin,The gimp?   I'll get him for ya.
jack,That's Tenpin -- s'posed to get out last Christmas but Snyder keeps tackin' more time on his sentence --
david, Be quiet -- they'll hear you --!
crutchy,"Hey, whattaya hangin' around here for? That Dave up there? Hiya, Dave!"
david,You mean it's true --? Crutchy hears something and quickly shushes them: Jack disappears from the window; Crutchy slumps into a bunk and pretends to sleep -- just as Snyder comes into the room. Utter silence --
jack,Crutchy won't last in there... I seen stronger guys than him not make it.
david,"What was he doing at the Refuge? JACK Runnin' for governor. Showin' his concern, like all pols during elections."
david,"Teddy's not like other politicians. He's the biggest hero in the country. JACK Anyway, he's there. I see his fancy coach waitin' for 'im, so I sneaks on top of it. Teddy gets in and he's wavin' goodbye, and all the guys are wavin' goodbye, and Snyder's wavin' -- 'Good-byeeee, Colonel Roosevelt!' So just as we're goin' out the gate, I stands up and --  He's governor now. I don't understand how he could see that place and not do anything -- JACK He only seen what Snyder wanted him to -- good food, everything the city pays for that Snyder usually steals."
david,"I'll bet if he just knew -- I mean, he's a hero -- JACK Last year he was a hero.   This year he's a politician."
weasel,"Okay, 'newsies' -- you check the funny papers this morning?"
denton,"Why don't you stop this -- ? COP  You better move along, mister... Denton turns, picks up something -- a large camera and tripod. He moves off quickly --"
spot,"So, ya showed me! Now I'll show you what Brooklyn can do --! The Thugs retreat from the merciless slingshots -- Jack rallies his Newsies and leads a screaming charge as the Thugs hurry behind the gates, closing them. Jack and Spot spit in their palms, shake hands as -- "

spot,Stop t'inkin' about yaself and let 'im read!
snyder,You know this boy...? CRUTCHY Him?   Nah.
snyder," This brain of mine, always makin' mistakes. Got a mind of its own. He hobbles out quickly.    Snyder looks at him, eyes narrowing."
jack,"We got money, Medda.      Some, anyway. "
david,We'll take a collection at the door. We'll pay whatever you ask.
medda,"It's not the money. I depend on the papers. They write good things about me, the customers flock here like sheep. They give me the pan, I'm the one who gets sheared. DAVID You're afraid of them, too..."
jack,Medda's gotta look out for herself same as anybody. We'll find another place. DAVID How can they make a whole city afraid? We're the ones putting our necks on the line -- all we need is for somebody to have the guts to stand up and show them we're not alone! MEDDA They have the power to destroy people...
david,They can't destroy you if you fight them -- only if you let them own you! MEDDA  You are so young... She looks back out at the stage; Jack pulls David away. Then --
medda,Got to be on Monday night.   I'm dark on Monday nights.
medda,Don't thank me. Thank Mr. Wisenheimer Guilt-maker of 1899 there.
kloppman,Can I help you? The figure turns -- Snyder smiles his smarmy smile.
snyder,Do you have a 'Jack Kelly' registered here? I wish to see him.
snipeshooter,"Unusual name for these parts.                  SKITTERY I knew a Jack somebody once. Prob'ly not the same guy. RACETRACK You mean Jack Kelly -- ? Behind Snyder, they see Jack bouncing in the front door. Racetrack tries to signal him -- RACETRACK -- He was here but he put an egg in his shoe and beat it. Jack sees Snyder -- but instead of running back out the door, he can't resist mocking him behind his back. The Newsies snicker; Kloppman is dying. SNYDER I have reason to believe he's an escaped prisoner. Possibly dangerous. KLOPPMAN Oh, dear me... dangerous? My files are in the rear -- this way, please. "
racetrack," Give to the Newsies strike fund, mista?"
jack,"Didn't wanna disturb nobody... anyway, it's like the Waldorf out here... great view, cool air --"
sarah,"It's all getting so big. The family's very worried about the boys. And you, too."
jack,Your mom and pop are worried about me...?
sarah, The whole family...
jack, Not that I been there or nothin'. SARAH Guess your parents wrote you about it. Bet you can't wait to see them again.
jack, Sure... big family reunion. Soon's I get the dough for train fare.
sarah,David said you spent all your money to rent the theater.
jack,Not that I blame you -- me bein' such an interestin' guy and all --
sarah, Are you...?
pulitzer,"A fugitive from one of your prisons, Mayor -- a convicted thief who's been at large for some time under the alias of 'Jack Kelly.' His real name is...?"
pulitzer,"By the way, Mayor, I'm having a few friends for cards that night -- newspaper friends, Willie Hearst, Gordon Bennett. Perhaps you'll join us -- we can talk about the coming election. "
mayor,"Chief, when you arrest this Kelly, you'd better go in force -- in case some of his misguided friends should start any trouble. As they go, Pulitzer picks up his magnifying glass and examines the leaflet. We CUT AWAY as he stares through the glass so he seems to be looking at --"
jack,"Hey, Denton -- sit down front! You're the guest of honor!"
denton, The only working press. As usual.
david,"As long as you keep writing about us, they're gonna know we exist."
pulitzer,"You know the boys, Mayor -- Mr. Bennett of The Tribune, Mr. Taylor of The Times, of course you know Mr. Hearst -- and this is a new member of our little group, Mr. Gammon, who just came back from Europe..."
jack,Carryin' the banner! AUDIENCE  Carryin' the banner! The noise threatens to blow the roof off the theater as we see --
racetrack,"Whatta we s'pose to do -- kiss 'em? JACK I personally wouldn't go that far, Race. SPOT  Any scab I see, I soak 'em -- period! DAVID That's just what they want you to do -- so they can say we're just thugs -- SPOT I don't care what they say -- some of us ain't made to just take it! I say anybody hurts us, we hurts them worst! Who's with me?"
medda,"Hiya, Newsies -- what's new? They roar; Racetrack's on his feet -- RACETRACK Hey, Medda, anytime you're off to the races, remember -- I got all the winners! MEDDA You're all winners here tonight, Racetrack. Just being with you makes me feel kinda extra extra. MUSH  I'm dead, I'm in Heaven -- somebody gimme a harp! MEDDA But you never know what life will bring. Over the years, I've developed quite an outlook --"
kid blink,"Oooo, lookout for that outlook! MEDDA And all kinds of people are always asking my advice, well, for instance -- "
mush,"Lookit me, I'm a bird, I'm flyin', I'm flyin' --"
kid blink,"It's a beautiful, Medda, I tellya, I never heard such beautiful!"
boots," Thank you, Boots. Would you keep it for me? For luck? Boots beams happily as she moves to --"
medda,"I'm afraid so, Race..."
medda,"YOU WIN SOME, YOU LOSE SOME, MY DEAR ALL IT'S HIGH TIMES, HARD TIMES SOMETIMES THE LIVIN' IS SWEET AND SOMETIMES THERE'S NOTHIN' TO EAT BUT I ALWAYS LANDS ON MY FEET SO WHEN THERE'S DRY TIMES I WAIT FOR HIGH TIMES AND THEN I PUTS ON MY BEST AND I STICKS OUT MY CHEST AND I'M OFF TO THE RACES AGAIN I PUTS ON MY BEST AND I STICKS OUT MY CHEST AND I'M OFF TO THE RACES AGAIN!"
denton,"I'm Denton of The Sun. I've heard about your work with young people. I wonder if you'd agree to an interview? Snyder blinks at him, glances at his watch, then lowers his police whistle, smiling modestly."
on stage,"David tries to move to Jack to warn him but Race and the others have formed a chorus line and drag him into it. David shouts over the song -- DAVID Jack -- you've gotta get out of here! Snyder!  Is it Snyder as in 'snide'? Furious, Snyder blows the police whistle for all he's worth. Instantly police burst in from every door -- all converging on Jack. Immediately he leaps off the stage into the arms of several boys below -- then fights his way out the front door --"
boots,"Try to reach the skylight -- ! Cops leap for Jack's legs as he rises above them heading up into the flies. He hangs on, thrusts one fist into the air and shouts -- JACK Carryin' the banner!"
medda,"Run, David, hurry --"
david,"They got Jack -- MEDDA You can't help him if you're in jail, too! You were right, David -- you've got to keep fighting them -- always.  Now go. Please. David looks at her, very moved, then goes. She turns back to her theater -- the sounds of the melee sweep over her. She watches, tears welling in her eyes..."
bailiff,"Awrise, awrise, court is now in session, Judge E.A. Monahan presiding."
snyder,This boy's real name is Francis Sullivan; mother deceased; father a convict in the state penitentiary --
jack,"-- Like demandin' you give us the food you steal from us -- SNYDER -- Followed by an additional six months for an attempted escape -- JACK  -- Last time wasn't no attempt, remember, Snyder? Me and Teddy Roosevelt wavin' bye-bye -- SNYDER -- Therefore, I ask that he be returned to the House of Refuge -- JACK -- For my own good, right, Movealong? -- and for what Snyder kicks back to ya -- SNYDER -- And that the court order his incarceration until the age of twenty-one --"
monahan,So ordered.   Next.
spot, You bummers is givin' me a headache.
david,Where you goin'? We need you.
spot,"Nachally  Spot Conlon is needed wherever  -- which right now is Brooklyn.   Some of my boys is worried,  I must give ear to their concerns  -- "
denton,Because it never happened.
david,"Denton, what's happened -- you get fired or somethin'?"
denton,"They could've blackballed me from every paper in the country. I'm a newspaperman, I have to have a paper to write for. He looks at David; hurt, betrayed, angry; wishes there was more he could say. He hands him something from his coat. DENTON This is the story I wrote about the rally. I want you to read it at least. He hands it to David and   goes. David returns to the others, angrily crumpling   the story and hurling it onto the table. The boys look    puzzled; Les, still eating the sausage, picks up the   story and looks at it curiously."
david,"That's where we saw Crutchy... He starts to throw up the rope when Boots hisses from the corner, beckoning furiously. They hurry over and peek around the corner to see --"
jack," Sorry to see you ain't doin' so good, Joe.                                             *"
pulitzer,"People think wars are about right and wrong. They're not. They're about power. You know what power is? JACK Heard of that, too.   I don't just sell ya papes, Joe.   Sometimes I read 'em. Pulitzer ignores the impudence, continues quietly. PULITZER Power means that I could see to it that you serve your full sentence at the Refuge. Or I could pull strings and have you free tomorrow. It means I could give you my pocket change -- and you'd have more money than you'd likely ever earn. JACK You bribin' me, Joe? Thanks for the compliment, but I ain't got the power to stop the strike -- PULITZER I disagree. You're the spirit of the strike, without you, they'd fall apart in a few days."
jack,"Ring for my coach, willya?   It's past my bedtime --"
pulitzer,Shut your mouth and listen !  You're going to do exactly as I say --
jack,I told ya... I can't call off the strike.
pulitzer,"I'm not asking you to. All I ask is that you return to your old job -- as Newsie for the The World. JACK And be a scab? Forget it -- PULITZER For a few days. Then the strike ends -- and it will end, boy, make no mistake -- and you can go wherever you want to buy a ticket. Free and clear, with money in your pocket... and no one chasing you. Jack is silent, troubled.    Pulitzer pushes a buzzer. PULITZER You go back to the Refuge. Think it over in your cell. Let me know in the morning."
david,Jack! 
jack,"You go to jail, what happens to your family? You don't know nothin' about jail! Thanks for what you done, but you gotta get outta here --"
david,I don't understand -- JACK I don't either -- I don't understand nothin' no more! Jack pushes David down the street.
jack,Just go!

jack,"SANTA FE MY OLD FRIEND I CAN'T SPEND MY WHOLE LIFE HIDIN' YOU'RE THE ONLY LIGHT THAT'S GUIDIN' ME TODAY Jack looks up as the serving panel opens and Crutchy peers through, offering him something furtively: a boiled potato. CRUTCHY Snitched it offa Snyder's plate when I was servin' him -- the biggest one!  Guess what I done to his sauerkraut."
jack, So what's it git'cha?
crutchy,"Anudder three months, prob'ly. But you can't let 'em beat'cha, right, Jack?"
jack,"We was beat when we was born. Crutchy, concerned, hears something and closes the panel."
david,"Nobody sells a pape today -- we're hurtin' them and they know it! Remember -- no soakin', no hittin' -- etc."
spot,"Look... I'm seein' t'ings... tell me I'm seeing t'ings -- ! David and the others look in disbelief -- walking with the scabs is Jack, wearing a tight new suit, flanked by Weasel and other goons. As Jack moves past, staring straight ahead, the chant dies..."

esther,That hand is not ready to work.
sarah, What is this?
les,Hey -- I'm saving that!
mayer,"There.   You see? Mayer smiles and goes.     Sarah moves to David with the stained papers. SARAH It's Denton's story. 'The Dark Truth: Why Our City Really Fears the Newsie Strike, by Bryan Denton. Last night I saw naked force exercised against mere boys, the Newsies, who earn at best a few pennies a day. I wondered why so much, against so little -- '"
kloppman,"He will only be a minute.   Please, no trouble."
racetrack,"Dear me, what is dat unpleasant aroma -- ?  Go on, take a shot -- I bust your scab face, ya yellow-livered,                           * rotten stinkin' piecea garbage!                         *"
weasel,"You try any tricks, and I go straight to Mr. Pulitzer.  Will you be requirin' anything else? Then I bid you good night."
weasel,"Sleep well, cowboy...? Jack ignores him, moves off with his papers. The Delanceys pass by; Morris grinning at him, bouncing a club in his hand. OSCAR Come wit' us, cowboy -- we're gonna fix your pal Davey today -- fix 'im so's he can't walk no more. MORRIS Shuddup!"
sarah,"Les, come on -- you're supposed to be helping me today. LES  I'd rather be soakin' scabs."

But they're the ones running. David, catching his breath, looks at Jack, beginning to understand. DAVID Couldn't stay away, huh.                                    *"

jack,"I got no choice. I stay here, they lock me up 'til I'm twenty- one."
sarah,Denton's story. JACK Denton looked out for hisself just like I gotta do -- so save it. SARAH Just listen! 'The men who run this city are terrified of the Newsies strike -- because other child laborers in the factories and sweatshops are hearing the message of the Newsies leader --' LES That's you!   He's writin' about you!
sarah,"'In the voice of Jack Kelly, these children hear strength and pride. Most of all, they hear hope...'"
denton,"' -- And that is what terrifies the powers-that-be, for they know our city thrives on the shame of child labor. Therefore, Jack Kelly's voice must be stopped, whatever the cost... "
jack,All them sweatshop kids are listenin' to me...?
david, What happened to the ace war correspondent? DENTON This war'll do for now.
sarah,"Whatever happens, it's Jack's decision. He's the one in danger. They look expectantly as he stares off, deep in thought. LES Jack...?   You thinkin'...? JACK Yeah... I'm thinkin' of Newsie Square full of kids..."
david, They still think I'm a scab...
les,I'll tell 'em you was a spy! 
jack,"Whattaya need to start a paper? Writers, right? So we got Denton. What else?"
les,Advertisements!  A printing press. And no paper or printer is going to defy Pulitzer. The others look discouraged; Jack's thinking again.
jack,"Les. Go set me straight with the Newsies, okay? Tell 'em to meet us later at the World Building."
jack,So happens I know a guy with a printing press.
jack,"They're  right above us -- and if Weasel  catches us, it won't be just me  they'll throw in the slammer  -- They can barely hear over the DIN of the PRESSES."
sarah,What -- ? JACK I said shhhh! -- or we all go to jail! The others shush him hastily; MUSIC BEGINS as they go into --

denton,"I thought you'd feel that way, Governor Roosevelt. TEDDY ROOSEVELT  Until now!"
pulitzer, Kelly's down there. He should be back in jail.
seitz," Those kids got out a pretty good paper, Chief. PULITZER Too good! Those illiterate guttersnipes couldn't have done this on their own. Somebody's behind this, trying to pull a fast one... JONATHAN Mr. Hearst on the line, sir. Wants to know if you've read the Newsies' paper? Pulitzer glowers in suspicion at the telephone. MAYOR I'm not taking the heat for this -- you've got to talk to them -- settle it --"
pulitzer,Tell Hearst I'm busy!  I'll settle it all right -- once and for all.
seitz,It's time to talk. 
pulitzer,"You're going to listen to me, boy -- JACK I'd like to, Joe --  -- but I can't hear ya. PULITZER We had a deal -- you broke it. You're going back to jail. JACK Maybe. But you can't put every kid in that square in jail. They ain't goin' away, Joe. PULITZER Neither am I. I can wait them out. It won't be me that's hurt. JACK You sure about that?"
jack,"It ain't about money, Dave -- if Joe gives in, that would mean nothin's like us got power. He can't let that happen -- no matter what it costs him. Right, Joe? PULITZER I'm about to show you what power really is... He slams the window shut; CROWD NOISE abruptly DROPS --"
pulitzer,"I have the police outside waiting to arrest you -- DAVID You lousy double-crossing -- ! PULITZER -- then I'll deal with that rabble in the street. He's crossing to a buzzer on his desk; Jack, thinking fast, snatches up a copy of the Newsies News."
jack,"Ya got me, Joe -- but tell me one thing, willya? How'd ya like our paper -- nice printin', ain't it? Right off the presses of one of New York's greatest newspapers --"
pulitzer,"All the papers have an agreement... we print nothing about the newsies. Whose press did you use?  It was Hearst, wasn't it...!"
pulitzer,"I knew it. Whoever helped you print this lying rag is trying to break the strike, get the jump on the rest of us. Well, you're going to expose this backstabber to the other owners -- in exchange, I'll call off the police."
pulitzer," All right, all right -- just say the traitor's name. It's Hearst, isn't it? Say it! Say the name of the scoundrel whose press you used so I can make him the disgrace of the newspaper world! Say his name, damn you!"
jack,"We just wanna say, 'Thanks, Joe.'  And Hearst and them other owners? Maybe they don't have to know. Depends."
pulitzer,Perhaps we can resolve our... small differences. David digs out their demands and prepares to read.
seitz,With pleasure. You're fired. WEASEL Come again...? A tomato hits him in the face; he turns to see Les wiping tomato juice off his hands.
les,"He said, you're fired. Triumphant, Jack hoists Les over his shoulders:"
jack,The strike's over -- we beat 'em! 
les," The bulls! Jack -- the bulls! Jack sees several police shoving through the crowd toward him. He quickly deposits Les -- turns to run and sees -- -- Snyder right in front of him, hands behind his back. Jack spins away and right into the arms of --"
jack,What're you talkin' about -- who come chargin' in?
crutchy,Who?   Your pal! Him!
elegant coach,parked across the square. A Rough Rider opens the door and a man leans forward -- a glimpse of silk hat and walrus mustache as Teddy Roosevelt raises his walking stick in salute to Jack across the square.
jack,Think he could drop me at the train yards?
jack,"It's now or never, Racetrack."
racetrack,"Won't be the same without ya. Give ya even odds on that. He shakes; the others crowd around. David looks on, left out for the moment; Sarah and Les beside him."
kid blink,"See ya in the funny papes, cowboy -- JACK Yeah, Blink, keep ya eye peeled. MUSH  -- think   of me."
crutchy,"Don't wanna alarm ya, Jack, but what I hear, out West ain't like New York at all -- it's fulla bulls, for one t'ing -- not cops, neither, but big ugly animals with horns and -- JACK "
jack,"Maybe that's what scares me... Suddenly, the emotions are too much for him -- he turns, runs across the square, not looking back, racing towards the coach. Les starts after him -- David catches him, holds him, as he and Sarah watch --"
les,Comin' down the chute!
