Speaker,Dialogue
billy cole,"gets up off the bench. The rest of the offensive unit sprints onto the field. Cole walks. Straight ahead, eyes front. Like a robot. His HEARTBEAT THUDS on the soundtrack. COLOR MAN  And so L.A. has a chance to ice the game, no pun intended... And you gotta be thinking, give the ball to Billy Cole. He has had an outstanding day, racking up 138 yards against a tough defense."
4.,"CONTINUED: The ball floats through the snowy air. Pitch-out to Cole. He takes it on the run. Tucks it under his arm. Behind him, the quarterback bites the dust, leveled. Cole turns the corner. Picks up a blocker. Feet pounding. Arms pumping. Up ahead, the free safety barrels toward him.    Low and hard. Cole does not blink. He reaches beneath his jersey. Pulls out a GUN. Pumps THREE SHOTS into the free safety's head."
police,"are on the field now. Running full out. They've got riot guns, cocked and locked. Sprinting through the snow. Cole crosses the goal line.   Touchdown. Drops the ball. Turns, facing the cops.   His eyes are insane. The crowd is screaming. People are running back and forth like extras in the Keystone Cops. The first TWO BLASTS from the cops' RIOT GUNS go high and wide. One SHOT BLOWS APART the base of the goalpost. The forty-foot-high monument pitches over, collapsing like a wounded giant. Lands in a shower of snow and ice. Cole is oblivious to the bars crashing around him.    He smiles and says: "
5.,CONTINUED: COLE I'm going to Disneyland... Puts the GUN to his helmet.   FIRES. CUT TO:
another angle,"Inside the car, a lone man is asleep, arms akimbo. Sprawled across the seat. Half-empty bottle of Seagrams V.O. RADIO on, playing tinny JAZZ music. Picture the  tiredest, meanest, grouchiest son of a bitch self-hating  loser you can. Now give him  a two-year-old suit from C & R Clothing. Such is the  aforementioned HALLENBECK."
another angle,THREE neighborhood KIDS have gathered around the car. Enjoying the spectacle of a sleeping drunk. One tosses a baseball from hand to hand. One picks his nose. 
6.,"CONTINUED: KID #1 Dude's trashed. KID #2 Shit, we should do something to him. Kid #3 continues mining for nose eggs.   It looks like his entire fist is up there. Pause, then: KID #3 I know where there's a dead squirrel."
another angle,Hallenbeck snores. The mashed squirrel perches on his chest. A shadow falls across him as --
kids,"return, scratching their heads.   Staring in at him. KID #2 Goddamn.   Dude's trashed. KID #3 Take his bottle. Kid #1 smiles nervously.   Reaches in with infinite patience. Trembling hand inches closer and closer -- And closes on the bottle as, without warning --"
7.,"HALLENBECK sits bolt upright and grabs the Kid and stuffs a .38 revolver in the Kid's face and cocks it. HALLENBECK Hey, motherfucker. The Kid, of course, shrieks. And the light of sanity dawns in Hallenbeck's eyes. He sucks in a deep breath. Releases the struggling Kid. Swears under his breath. Watches    the boys flee in terror. Notices a dead squirrel    in his lap. Scowls. Heaves it out the window. Pumps    a Camel into his mouth. Lights it. Rescues the bottle of    Seagrams."
hallenbeck,Excuse me. He leans over and vomits on the lawn. One hand gripping the car fender. The sprinkler goes round and round.
8.,"INT. BEACH HOUSE - SAME TIME A plush bedroom.   Sun streams in the window. A YOUNG MAN sits, straddling a backwards chair.     Bare- foot, bare-chested. Blond hair, perfect tan. He is nursing a beer.   Smoking and staring at --"
bed,"where a tawny golden girl lies, serene and innocent. Like a sleeping kitten. Rumpled sheets, one breast exposed. No tan line. The man takes a drag off the cigarette, studies the sleeping girl. Meet Jimmy Dix. Twenty-seven years old, former National League heartthrob. He shakes his head and mutters: JIMMY  Jesus, kid, if only you weren't so damn ugly. He gets up and goes into the head. Pulls out a glass vial. Dips a coke spoon with practiced ease. Sucks it up a nostril. For one moment, he catches his own eye in the mirror. FLASH CUT TO:"
jimmy's face,"Covered with dirt and mud. Blood, too. Young and proud. Seventy thousand voices tell him he's alive. He makes a difference."
9.,"BACK TO PRESENT Alone in the bathroom... leaning on the counter.    Head down. A voice calls softly from the bedroom: SLEEPY VOICE  Jimmy, are you still here...? Pause, then: JIMMY I don't know. He looks up at his reflection. Glazed eyes, beard stubble. Crows' feet around the eyes. JIMMY Yeah.    I guess I am. He sniffs, clearing his nose."
10.,"CONTINUED: MALE  Mmmmm? What's mmmmm? Jeez, you sound fucking terrific. What'd you do last night? HALLENBECK Sat in the car. Looked at the sky. Got hammered."
11.,"CONTINUED: MALE  Terrific.    And, Joe, big favor, okay? Try    to... fix yourself up, if you can   manage it. Look the part. Not    like the last time, okay? Hallenbeck catches his reflection in the mirror over the TV. His face is ashen grey. Hollow eye sockets. Blotchy skin. HALLENBECK Gimmee the address."
14.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY Ho.    Ray. The MAN looks up, annoyed. RAY  Too early in the morning, Ray. Let her go. RAY Fuck you. She's not coming up till she starts blowing. Jimmy swallows hard.   Says: JIMMY Ray.   Let her go. RAY Fuck   you, loser. What are you doing at a   league party, asshole? You and ol'   Dex Manley should get together, swap   stories about gettin' booted."
15.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY Fine. Jimmy turns, as if to walk away. Instead, he spins back and launches the football. It sings, that's how hard he throws it. And when it smacks Ray in the face, something breaks. It ain't the ball. The big man howls. Clutching his flattened nose. The girl comes up for air. Gagging and choking. Jimmy is at her side instantly. Pulls her out of the water."
jimmy,"Get out of here. Go. She goes. He leans over and grabs Ray by the hair. The guy is bleeding. Delirious. Jimmy yanks until their faces are inches apart. JIMMY Best arm in the National League, you son of a bitch. Remember that. He lets go. Ray sags, semi-conscious. The poker players come running as Jimmy walks back inside."
16.,"INT. HALLENBECK'S HOUSE - SAME TIME Hallenbeck enters and crosses the living room. A woman, forty-ish, once beautiful, appears in the bedroom doorway. Wearing a terry cloth robe. This is Joe's wife SARAH. SARAH I thought you were in Las Vegas. HALLENBECK I was. SARAH Where did you sleep? HALLENBECK Office. He brushes past her and crosses to the bed.   On the pillow, a big stuffed cat toy smiles benignly. HALLENBECK Hey, Furry Tom. He sits on the bed. Lights a cigarette. Opens the night stand and removes a speedloader for his .38. Starts to load the gun. SARAH How much did you lose? HALLENBECK I wasn't there to gamble.    I was doing a skip trace. SARAH How much did you lose?"
hallenbeck,"Fifty bucks. He suddenly notices a sheet of paper on the night stand. A crayon sketch. He picks it up, frowns: HALLENBECK What's this? SARAH Darian's class drew holiday pictures. That was hers. Her teacher wants to see us, Joe."
17.,"CLOSE ON DRAWING It's a picture   of Santa Claus,  except this Santa has long, stringy hair,   bloodshot eyes,  and grotesque talons. A little girl's   severed head is  clutched in one hand. Underneath, in   block capitals,  is written: SATAN CLAUS."
18.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Yeah, but they don't apply it with a paint sprayer. And for your information, our neighbors think I'm very funny. SARAH Go live with them. HALLENBECK Don't tempt me. He tosses the holstered .38 on the bed.   Stalks into the bathroom."
sarah,Excuse me? HALLENBECK 
19.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK  Because someone else was in there, right, and since he's not under the bed you must have stuck him in the closet when you heard my key in the door a day early. Tah-dah. Please, no applause. A silence hangs between them.    Sarah just stares.   Shakes her head. SARAH Well, nothing changes.    You're still a lunatic."
hallenbeck,"Mmmmm. I'm sorry, honey, I don't enjoy being observant, but someone's gotta do it.  What's his name? SARAH Please leave.    I have to get dressed. HALLENBECK It's okay, I've seen you naked. So, apparently, has someone else. What's his name? SARAH You want me to open the closet, Joe? Huh? You want me to indulge your fucking paranoia, I'll throw the door open, is that what you want me to do...?"
hallenbeck,"Is this a trick question? SARAH I'll do it, Joe. Okay? And then we'll both know you're a psycho, is that what you want? Huh?? An awkward pause.   Finally Hallenbeck scowls and says: HALLENBECK No.   We won't open the door. SARAH Thank you. "
20.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK  ... I'm gonna count to three, and then I'm gonna put a bullet in there, and you can stop me anytime by speaking the truth. One. SARAH If you shoot up my house, Joe, I will make you eat that gun."
hallenbeck,"Two. The truth is a beautiful thing. He cocks the hammer.   Arm extended, hand rock steady. SARAH Call your shrink, Joe. I still have the number. Call him and tell him you're losing it, I cannot fucking deal with you like this -- ! HALLENBECK Three.   Last chance. SARAH Joe, dammit -- ! He sighs. Starts to pull the trigger.    And Sarah screams --"
sarah,"Jesus, no -- ! And grabs the gun. Everything freezes. She looks at him.    He looks at her. Understanding occurs."
closet door,"swings slowly open, then... And out steps a man in a bathrobe. Compact. Wiry. Hair still soaking wet. None other than MIKE MILLER, Joe's early morning phone call. We know this because Joe says: "
21.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Hello, Mike.   Keeping her warm for me? The gun barrel does not waver.    Not an inch. MILLER Easy, Joe.   Don't do nothing dumb. HALLENBECK How as she, Mike? On your finger scale, how was my wife...? MILLER It just happened, Joe.     It just happened. HALLENBECK You call me from here this morning? MILLER She said you were in Vegas. I was gonna leave a message on the machine. HALLENBECK When you found out I was back.       Why didn't you split? MILLER She said relax, he never stops home once he's in the office. HALLENBECK Normally I wouldn't. MILLER "
22.,"CONTINUED: MILLER You gotta understand -- HALLENBECK I know, I know, it just happened. It was an accident. Sure. You tripped. You said, 'Whoops,' and accidentally fucked my wife. Gee, Mrs. H., I'm sorry, just isn't my week. Sure, Mike. Happen to anybody.  I don't gotta understand anything. Sarah speaks then.   Head down.   Eyes averted."
sarah,"Put the gun down. HALLENBECK Hmmm?  Oh, right, the gun.  You're right, Sarah, I'm acting nuts. He pulls the trigger. The SHOT is DEAFENING in the closed room. Mike Miller screams and clutches at himself. The bullet goes high and wide. Over his head. On the wall is a framed wedding photo. The twin of the one in Hallenbeck's office. The bullet strikes it dead center. Blows it to pieces. Silence. The tinkle of glass hitting the floor. Hallenbeck turns. Regards his wife with hooded, lifeless eyes. HALLENBECK Where was Darian? SARAH She stayed at Cindy's last night. He nods.   Turns and waves the gun at Miller. HALLENBECK Let's take a walk, Buddy."
23.,"CONTINUED: Miller's car, a Pontiac Sunbird, is parked at the curb. Hallenbeck stops in the middle of someone's yard. Holsters his gun. A neighbor's dog approaches, happily wagging its tail. Hallenbeck bends and ruffles its fur. HALLENBECK Where you want it, Mike?     Head or gut? MILLER Listen, Joe, I --  Gut. Hallenbeck pats the dog. Straightens. Plants his back foot and spins. Punches like a sledgehammer, into Miller's gut. Miller drops to his knees. Begins to retch. Hallenbeck takes out a cigarette. Lights it. HALLENBECK If I see you again, I'll kill you. Miller nods weakly.    Gasping for breath. HALLENBECK So.   West Hollywood at seven, right? MILLER Huh...?"
hallenbeck,"The job.     Seven o'clock, right? MILLER You still... want the job...? HALLENBECK It's two hundred bucks. MILLER Yeah.   I guess it is. He climbs to his feet, still doubled over. MILLER I'm sorry, Joe. "
24.,"CONTINUED: Hallenbeck says nothing. Miller turns and stumbles to his car. Hallenbeck's face betrays nothing. A dead mask. He walks back toward the hedge. The neighbor's dog runs up, a tennis ball in its mouth. Behind him, Mike Miller gets into the Sunbird. Hallenbeck takes the tennis ball. Throws it. The DOG BARKS and bounds after it. Mike Miller turns the key in the ignition. The CAR BLOWS to pieces. An ERUPTION OF FLAME. Flying glass and metal. The car becomes airborne. Engulfed in fire. Does a lazy spin. Comes down. The shockwave catches Hallenbeck.   Slams him ass over teacups. Windows blow in up and down the street. Smoke and fire roll to the sky. The DOG cowers, HOWLING in fear. Beside it on the grass, the tennis ball is on fire. Hallenbeck rolls to his feet. Covered with twigs and leaves. Clothing scorched. Stares. Eyes glazed. CUT TO:"
25.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK He came by to talk business. He had a case he was to busy to continue with, a routine surveillance. He farmed it out to me. UNIFORM COP I see.    Is that all you talked about? HALLENBECK Yeah.    That's all. He looks the Officer in the eye.      Betrays nothing."
26.,"CONTINUED: HARP My son. He writes his own material, he's proud of that. Some people are proud, they cured leukemia. Old guy stops beating off long enough to laugh, my son thinks he's Eddie Murphy. Jimmy uncaps a beer and raises it in a toast. JIMMY Alex the astronaut. Harp raises his own glass."
harp,"Alex the astronaut. It seems to be a common ritual between them. Jimmy drinks, thumps the bottle down. Says, resolutely: JIMMY I've had it, Harp. HARP Had what? JIMMY It, man. I've had it.  I don't remember what I did  last night. I'm an idiot, Harp,   I act like a complete dickhead.   I don't have friends. I drink too   much. I fuck anything that's warm  and breathing."
harp,"Stay on that side of the bar. JIMMY  I cheated on my girl friend again. HARP You cheated on her?   You must be crazy. JIMMY Maybe so, Harp. Maybe so. His gaze wanders across the crowded room, fixating on --"
27.,"SCANTILY-CLAD WAITRESS Who makes her way between the tables. She is beautiful. Stands out like a teamster at a gay rights rally. Supple body. Deep green eyes. Flaxen hair. Her name is CORY. She stops at a table against the wall. Puts down a Seagrams V.O. in a rocks glass. Seated at the table is a broad-shouldered man in a bad suit. The essence of boredom. Looks like he's been there three days. A cloud of smoke hangs around his head. Mr. Joe Hallenbeck, no less. HALLENBECK The police won't help you, huh? CORY Sure. After I'm dead they'll perform the autopsy. HALLENBECK Guess you don't want to wait that long. CORY Guess not. HALLENBECK "
28.,CONTINUED: She smiles and moves away. Hallenbeck sips his drink.      Scans the crowd with shrewd eyes.
another angle,"The lovely Cory approaches Jimmy at the bar.     Harp looks on. CORY  Hello, handsome. How'd you like to buy me a bottle of champagne?"
jimmy,"How much for a bottle? CORY Forty dollars. JIMMY No thanks. Nothing personal, my seventh grade teacher was killed by a drunk driver. CORY Tall guy?   Sandy hair? JIMMY That's the one. CORY I had to swerve three times to get him."
jimmy,"Ha-ha. CORY So no bottle, then? JIMMY For forty bucks I'd rather drink my own piss. CORY That's extra. And with that, she leans over and moulds her lips to his. Time passes. These two know each other, it would seem. Cory pulls away. Jimmy smiles. JIMMY Hi, Cory.   Rough night? "
29.,"CONTINUED: CORY Arrgh.   I've had it to here. JIMMY  I have to get ready to dance. JIMMY Come back soon. I want to buy you a drink. She smiles and moves off, swishingly. Jimmy watches her go. His gaze wanders across the room to Hallenbeck. He frowns."
another angle,"Near the stage, the would-be Eddie Murphy steps up to the mike and says: EMCEE You know, crowd, these ladies are fine, but let me tell you the three reasons men prefer sheep: they're always in the mood, they never bitch, and after you fuck 'em you can eat 'em. A few chuckles.   Some coughs.   More coughs than chuckles. EMCEE "
30.,CONTINUED: Her body is exquisite. She moves like breath. Her eyes can put you under. She is simply that beautiful.
hallenbeck,"sits with his drink untouched before him. Pats his suit pockets, searching for a smoke. Removes a crumpled, empty pack, as:"
jimmy dix,"saunters up, looking less than friendly. He looks at Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck does not look at him."
jimmy,"Hi.   You're nobody. HALLENBECK Shhh.   Don't tell anyone. JIMMY That's what Cory said.    She said you were nobody. Only Hallenbeck's eyes move. He looks up, regards Jimmy coolly. They size each other up. Hallenbeck sighs. HALLENBECK Easy, Junior,   I'm not raining on your parade.    She's too young for me. I'm just    keeping an eye on her for a few   days. JIMMY I see. What are you, some kind of bodyguard? HALLENBECK Something like that. You got a cigarette? JIMMY No.   Is Cory in trouble? HALLENBECK I hope not.   You tell me. JIMMY She didn't mention anything to me. HALLENBECK Mmmm.   That bothers you, doesn't it? "
31.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY Maybe. HALLENBECK Don't sweat it. Women have secrets. Water is wet, the sky is blue, and women have secrets.  I'll buy you a beer. Sit down. Jimmy remains standing. JIMMY She hired you, huh?      What, you in the phonebook?"
hallenbeck,"Yeah.    Actually, she hired my buddy Mike.    I'm filling in. JIMMY Where's Mike? HALLENBECK He died. JIMMY Sorry to hear it. HALLENBECK Don't be. He was a lousy surveillance man. Jimmy leans forward, palms flat on the table. JIMMY Look, friend, I don't know who you are or what's going on. But Cory is my girl friend and if she's in trouble, I want to hear about it. HALLENBECK That's client confidential. JIMMY Tell me anyway. HALLENBECK Nope. JIMMY I say two words to Cory and you don't get paid, asshole. "
32.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Do it. JIMMY You sure? I'm looking at your suit, you could use the dough. HALLENBECK You don't like my suit, guess what? I don't like your money. JIMMY Good, 'cause you're not getting any. HALLENBECK Story of my life. JIMMY What is? HALLENBECK Not getting any. They stare each other down.      Hallenbeck calmly sips his bourbon. JIMMY You couldn't protect a cup of warm piss. HALLENBECK  Hit me. JIMMY Excuse me?"
hallenbeck,"Hit me. Bust me in the chops, chickenshit. "
33.,CONTINUED: HALLENBECK  Joe Hallenbeck. I'm a private detective.
jimmy," I don't know, Joe... You look like a dumb wop to me. HALLENBECK At least I didn't shit my talent away on coke, motherfucker. JIMMY Can I hit you now? HALLENBECK Absolutely. Jimmy throws a short jab at Hallenbeck's chin. It never gets there. Joe moves, lightning quick, and suddenly Jimmy's fist is trapped. Dead stops. Fingers grinding into palm. Jimmy swears. Stumbles. Sits down hard. Hallenbeck releases him."
hallenbeck,"Please, have a seat. JIMMY "
34.,CONTINUED: JIMMY Piss off. HALLENBECK  Hell.   I'm a fan.
35.,"CONTINUED: Suffice to say, they fog the screen. At last, Jimmy rolls over and pours champagne into two crystal glasses. Lifts one in a toast. JIMMY Alex the pediatrician. CORY  Alex the pediatrician. They drink.   And from this blissful affirmation of life we --"
36.,"CONTINUED: He bends to pick up the butt. A steel sap whistles over his head, missing by inches. Hallenbeck spins, startled. Reflexively lashes out with a flattened palm. Misses, chops the air. Two more men, behind him. Nowhere to go. A sap pops him behind the left ear. A sickening thud. The world spins out of focus. He goes down. Hits the pavement like a ton of bricks. Rolls over, staring up. Vision muddy, indistinct."
another angle,"The two other Hitmen return to their gray, late-model sedan. Climb into the car and sit, watching the nightclub. Waiting. "
37.,"EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT A rusty chain-link fence separates the lot from the boule- vard. Choked with weeds. Broken glass. A rusted-out car. A towering billboard looms overhead, inviting people to drink Scotch or get laid, it's hard to tell. Hallenbeck staggers drunkenly across the lot. The crag-faced man follows behind him. CRAG-FACE "
38.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK You need a special funny bullet. CRAG-FACE Come on, cut it out. Head or chest? HALLENBECK That's what your wife said. CRAG-FACE Would you quit with the wife? Enough is enough. HALLENBECK Ask me how fat she is."
39.,"CONTINUED: CRAG-FACE Bastard. Hallenbeck meets his gaze.    A savage, feral gleam in his eye. HALLENBECK And then some. The guy pitches over dead. Hallenbeck kneels beside him. Retrieves his .38, holsters it.       Slips the hitman's pistol into his waistband."
hallenbeck,I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th. He takes off running.
another angle,The Hitmen wait in the darkened sedan. Watching Jimmy and Cory. The driver keys the ignition. Starts the car. In his lap is an automatic rifle.
40.,CONTINUED: He slams into a man. Knocks him flat. Groceries fly. Joe doesn't care. He stumbles. Keeps going.
gray sedan,"passes Jimmy. Accelerating. ENGINE REVVING. Jimmy only gets one glimpse into the passing car. It's enough: Everyone inside is armed to the teeth. The SEDAN ROARS around the corner, cutting in front of Jimmy. JIMMY Oh God. This is a hit this is a fucking hit!!"
gray sedan,comes up behind Cory. Comes up fast. Rams her car. Metal crumples. Meanwhile:
jimmy,"frantically floors the pedal of his Jag, pops the clutch -- And stalls out. He roars with anger. Flings open the door. Leaps out and runs forward, screaming: JIMMY Cory, get out of there!! Too late.    Cory is already out of her car, yelling: CORY Hey, can't you fucking drive?? "
41.,"CONTINUED: Her eyes go wide with shock. The Hitmen burst from their car.    OPEN UP on full auto. Cory is cut down. Blown backward over the hood of her Ford. Flung to the street. JIMMY Oh Gooood!! And without missing a beat, the Hitmen turn -- And OPEN FIRE on Jimmy. He takes a running start. Clears the hood of his Jag in a single leap. BULLETS DICE the metal behind him."
two hitmen,"move toward him, triggering THREE SHOT BURSTS. The kid is dead meat. Or so it seems until, without warning --"
joe hallenbeck,"charges into the intersection.     Screaming bloody murder. He's got a GUN in each fist, and both are BLAZING. One Hitman dies immediately: Dances like a puppet, racked by gunfire. Bullets go through him. SHATTER the sedan's WINDSHIELD."
42.,"CONTINUED: Shatters the Hitman between the two cars... And holy Christ, the guy's still alive. Pinned like a butterfly, legs broken... He raises his rifle, screaming. Jimmy dives flat on the front seat.    The WINDSHIELD ERUPTS. The Hitman.   Still pinned.   Still screaming. He FIRES SHOT AFTER SHOT into Jimmy's car. Hallenbeck walks up behind him. Puts a BULLET in his head. He stops screaming."
jimmy,"is still huddled on the front seat in a sea of broken glass. Hallenbeck walks up, leans in the window. HALLENBECK Hey.  Back up."
another angle,"Jimmy puts it in reverse. The car backs up. Steam pouring from the crumpled hood. The Hitman, now freed, collapses to the street. Like a sack of flour."
motel manager,"stands outside a door marked OFFICE. Holding a pump action shotgun leveled at Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck nods at the bodies in the street. HALLENBECK It's all over, compadre. MANAGER Get off my property, mister. "
43.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK  Sidewalk belongs to the government. He turns and looks at Jimmy. The kid is in pain. Staring at Cory's bullet-riddled body. Eyes glazed. Hallenbeck says nothing. He crosses to the shattered Hitman. Kneels  down, fishes through the guy's coat pockets. Comes  up with a bloody pack of cigarettes. Extracts one.  Lights it. SIRENS fill the air. And Jimmy snaps out of it long enough to reach into his coat -- Takes out the vial of coke. Ditches it. Drops it down a sewer grating, out of sight. No one sees him do it."
police cruisers,"come SQUEALING up, flashers turning. Surrounding Jimmy, who stands, head down and motionless -- And Joe, who smokes and looks at the moon. CUT TO:"
44.,"CONTINUED: McCASKEY How do you know? BESSALO I know how the bastard's mind works. Every lie has eighty percent truth to it. Guy scares me. McCaskey is staring out the window at Hallenbeck. McCASKEY We lookin' at the same guy? BESSALO  A long time ago, that son of a bitch saved the President's life."
45.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY None of your fucking business. HALLENBECK Listen up, friend. I'm trying to get a handle on this. How was she fixed for money? JIMMY  I don't know. Pretty strapped, I guess. HALLENBECK Always kept an eye out for work?"
jimmy,"No hooking, if that's what you mean. HALLENBECK It isn't. Tell me what she did at the club, besides dance. JIMMY The usual. Waitressing. Get a guy to buy you a bottle of champagne. Sit in a private booth, let the poor fuck spill his troubles. Used to say she'd make a great psychiatrist. HALLENBECK She get many high rollers? JIMMY Sure.   Even rich guys get lonely."
hallenbeck,Fine. 
46.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Would she consider the possibility of blackmail? JIMMY  She'd consider it. If she could get away with it. But she'd need hard evidence. Otherwise, it's 'I never said that,' his word against hers. HALLENBECK Right.   So what does she do?"
jimmy,"I don't know.    Follow the guy?   Have him followed? HALLENBECK Bingo. Kid, this is making sense. She hires somebody to follow the mark and obtain blackmail evidence. JIMMY Who does she hire? HALLENBECK Ah.  She hires my buddy Mike.  Right? Right. It makes sense. Except -- JIMMY Except you told me that Mike was a shitty surveillance man."
hallenbeck,"Exactly. He got spotted. They made him, and they killed him. Then they took out Cory. JIMMY Christ, what did the two of them stumble onto? HALLENBECK Whatever it was, it was way over their heads. They knew they were in trouble. JIMMY How you figure? "
47.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Because Mike was scared. He bailed out and threw the case in my lap. JIMMY He handed it to you... without telling you how dangerous it was? Hallenbeck stares straight ahead.    Sighs and says: HALLENBECK He was fucking my wife, Jimmy.  I die. He gets my wife."
48.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Get some sleep. JIMMY Wow. What stunning advice.      I was gonna go hiking. HALLENBECK Fuck you. They start down the hallway, side by side. JIMMY You know something, Joe, for a private eye, you sure don't go in for snappy comebacks. HALLENBECK How's this? Fuck you and the horse that looks like you. JIMMY Get some sleep. A passing PATROLMAN stops.   Eyes Jimmy thoughtfully. Frowns: PATROLMAN You look real familiar.     Do I know you? Jimmy grins, shrugs.   Obviously flattered. JIMMY You might.    Some people recognize me."
patrolman,"Got it. Peanuts Morton. Used to sell hash in Crenshaw District. JIMMY No, man. I played football. Jimmy Dix, L.A. Stallions. PATROLMAN What position? JIMMY Forget it. PATROLMAN Fuckin' football. Free agents ruined the damn game. "
49.,"CONTINUED: He walks away.   Jimmy scowls.    Grumbles to himself. HALLENBECK We gotta cross the parking lot. You wanna borrow my sunglasses? JIMMY Fuck you. HALLENBECK Hey, snappy comeback. You a detective? As the two cross the muster room toward the front doors, they pass the hooker we saw earlier. She is talking to her pimp. There is a heated exchange.     The pimp slaps her.   Hard. Suddenly, Jimmy lunges forward.     Balling his fists. JIMMY That son of a bitch! He's ready to clean the pimp's clock when Hallenbeck grabs him, spins him bodily. Propels him out the front doors. Away from trouble."
jimmy,"He hit the chick. HALLENBECK You don't start a fight in a police station, dickhead. Are you really this stupid or did you take lessons? JIMMY Guy shouldn't treat a woman like that, is all I'm saying. He just shouldn't, okay? HALLENBECK Why? Because they're weak and need protecting? "
50.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY  Yeah. He's serious. Hallenbeck starts to chuckle. Shakes his head, lights a cigarette. Laughs through the smoke. This may be the funniest thing he's ever heard. CUT TO:"
jimmy,"Mind if I catch a ride with you? HALLENBECK Yes. JIMMY My car's fucked up, remember? HALLENBECK Take the bus. JIMMY Cut it out. Look, you sorta saved my life. Let me buy you a beer. HALLENBECK I'm not thirsty. Good night. He approaches his battered Plymouth.    Jimmy scowls."
jimmy,That's it.     Good night? HALLENBECK Go home.     Get some sleep. JIMMY What are you gonna do? HALLENBECK I'm gonna get a message to the people who killed your friend. JIMMY What's the message? 
51.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK That we're out of it. That whatever they're doing, they don't have to worry about us. JIMMY You're kidding. Joe gets in the car.   Says nothing. JIMMY You're backing off, you're not gonna do anything? I watch T.V., what the fuck kind of private eye doesn't do anything?"
hallenbeck,"The kind with a wife and kid. Look, it's over. My job is done. JIMMY Fuck you your job is done.    We witnessed a murder, Joe! HALLENBECK Yes, it was very exciting. Tomorow I'll take you to the zoo.  You wanna play hero, go ahead. When you die, I'll take your closet full of eighty-dollar shirts. JIMMY Look, until this is over, I'm sticking with you."
hallenbeck,"The hell you are. JIMMY I'm part of this. We do something, we do it together. HALLENBECK Have a ncie night. He STARTS the CAR. JIMMY Don't drive away, Joe. Joe puts it in gear.   Pulls away. "
52.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY Joe -- !     I'll tell the cops, Joe. Joe taps the brake.    Stops.   Leans out the window, says softly: HALLENBECK Tell them what, Jimmy? JIMMY That Mike Miller was fucking your wife.  You don't start a fight in a police station, dickhead. HALLENBECK You and me is not a fight.     You and me is a massacre. JIMMY Gosh, you're tough. HALLENBECK Get in the fucking car."
53.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Mmmm. Used to be a pretty fair ventriloquist. JIMMY Ventriloquist, really? I hear Ps and Bs are the hardest. HALLENBECK Yeah, well, actually -- JIMMY "
54.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY Yeah? What were you, cop or something? HALLENBECK Secret Service. JIMMY You're high. Get outta here.  Damn. I knew there was a hero lurking beneath that gruff exterior. HALLENBECK Yeah, I'm a prince. Shut the fuck up."
55.,"EXT. ADULT LIVING COMPLEX - NIGHT Jimmy and Hallenbeck make their way down a flagstone walk between tiny, palm-shaded cottages. The moon casts a pale glow. HALLENBECK Bet these places run a fortune. JIMMY Tell me about it. I'm paying the fucking rent. HALLENBECK How charming. Sounds like a great girl. What else did you spring for? Clothes? Car payments?"
jimmy,"Wasn't like that. Cory could've had lots of rich guys. Me, she loved. HALLENBECK Oh. Love.   Well, forget about it, then. JIMMY Let me guess.    You don't believe in love. HALLENBECK  I believe in cancer. I believe in love. JIMMY What, they're both diseases?"
hallenbeck,"Something like that. Jimmy shakes his head sadly. JIMMY Man, I don't want to meet the bitch that fucked you up. HALLENBECK I'm sure she'd love meeting you. Probably blow you on the front porch. JIMMY Little bitter, Joe? HALLENBECK Eat shit."
56.,"EXT. MOONLIT COTTAGE The two men approach the door.   Jimmy takes out his key ring. HALLENBECK The cops are gonna want to check this place out, so don't disturb anything. JIMMY Yes, massah."
jimmy,Assuming there was any.     Stay here a minute. HALLENBECK Where you going? JIMMY Bathroom. You wanna come with me? Doctor said I shouldn't lift anything heavy. HALLENBECK I'll pass. Hallenbeck starts inspecting the wreckage.
57.,"INT. CLUTTERED BATHROOM Jimmy enters and shuts the door behind him. He scans the floor, covered with clothes, bottles, etc. Picks up a carelessly discarded can of Right Guard deodorant. Turns it upside down, and unscrews the bottom. Inside, the can is hollow and empty. The perfect hiding place. Jimmy heaves a sigh of relief. Removes a little plastic Baggie filled with white powder. Stashes it in his shorts. Starts to replace the lid. Stops. Frowns. Reaches into the can a second time -- And pulls out a yellow envelope. He looks at it, perplexed. Puts it in his pocket. Replaces the lid. Tosses the can on the floor. Flushes the toilet. Leaves."
58.,CONTINUED: JIMMY I may have something. HALLENBECK What? JIMMY Later.   Let's get out of here.
hallenbeck,"Where the hell are you going? JIMMY As long as we're here, I might as well take Cory's car. HALLENBECK You got the keys? JIMMY Yeah.    I'll follow you. Hallenbeck starts to turn away.      Jimmy gets in the car. Hallenbeck stops. Frowns. HALLENBECK Cory has two cars? JIMMY Yeah. This one's just sitting here until she can sell it. The color drains from Hallenbeck's features. HALLENBECK Jimmy, no!! He sprints across the sidewalk and yanks Jimmy out of the driver's seat before he can key the ignition. JIMMY Ouch -- !     What's your problem?"
another angle,Hallenbeck kneels and peers under the car. 
59.,"CONTINUED: Swears softly as he sees two thin copper wires, glinting in the moonlight. HALLENBECK They used a car bomb on Mike, it figures they'd try it on her, too.  Except they wired the wrong car. Jimmy pales noticeably. JIMMY Oh.   Shit.    Oh. Jeez. Hallenbeck claps him on the back."
hallenbeck,"Easy, kid. No harm, no foul.     We caught it in time. He strolls toward his Plymouth, whistling. Cheerfully unaffected. Jimmy catches his breath. Swallows hard. Turns, and bumps into Hallenbeck, coming back the other way. JIMMY What are you doing? Hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire-cutters. HALLENBECK Gotta disconnect the fucker. JIMMY Whoa. Hold on. Um, shouldn't we call the bomb squad or something? HALLENBECK "
60.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Come on, chickenshit. Just snip the wire. Jimmy hesitates, then takes the cutters. Reaches beneath the wheel well. Plucks at the wire tentatively. Cuts. HALLENBECK Oh, shit not that one! Jimmy screams and stumbles backward. Lands on his ass. Hallenbeck is chuckling softly. Shakes his head as he walks around to release the hood. JIMMY You're a fucking asshole! HALLENBECK And then some, Junior. And then some. TIME CUT TO:"
61.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY Sure.   Family, huh?   You got kids? HALLENBECK Yeah.   Little girl. JIMMY Does she like you? HALLENBECK Not much, no. And she likes Prince, so go figure. JIMMY I like Prince."
hallenbeck,"Great, you can marry my daughter. Or better yet, fuck my wife. I hear all it takes is a credit card and two valid I.D.'s.  Hold it right there, gentlemen. They stop.   Slowly they turn."
two men,"are approaching from out of the trees. One holds a flashlight trained on Hallenbeck and Jimmy. The other carries a silenced Beretta. JIMMY Is it the cops? HALLENBECK No, Jimmy.   It's not the cops. "
62.,"CONTINUED: Working quickly, Hallenbeck tapes the bomb to the inside of the truck lid. Slams it shut. Turns, facing the new arrivals. The MEN wear tailored suits with matching ties. One is tall and lean. The other is a bruiser, short and stout. They both have the seasoned look of professional mob hitters. The Taller Man speaks, gun held rock steady. TALL MAN Good evening, gentlemen. Bit late for a stroll, don't you think?"
hallenbeck,"Yeah, you two better be getting home. JIMMY The streetlights are on. TALL MAN That's amusing. How delightful to find such amusing men so late at night. "
63.,"CONTINUED: Jake slips on a pair of brass knuckles. Steps up and delivers a looping right to Hallenbeck's face. A sickening crunch. A two inch gash streams blood. Jake relieves Hallenbeck of his gun. TALL MAN Perhaps we can dispense with the fun and games now, yes? Jimmy rushes forward, snarling. The Beretta swivels. Jimmy stops, the gun aimed at his gut. HALLENBECK  Give up, Jimmy. We're dealing with geniuses."
64.,"CONTINUED: TALL MAN  Ah, my young friend... I neglected to tell you that Jake attacks his job with a certain... exuberance. JIMMY Christ... I'm being beat up by the inventor of Scrabble. TALL MAN He's still in a good mood, Jake. Kick him again. Jake steps forward."
hallenbeck,"Wait! Hallenbeck speaks through cracked, bloody lips: HALLENBECK You want the fucking evidence that the stripper had. I've got it. So we can play games, or I can hand it over. JIMMY And then you'll let us go, right? TALL MAN Sure.  We'll let you go.  Where is it? Hallenbeck meets the Tall Man's gaze.    Speaks softly."
hallenbeck,"Hand me the car keys, Jimmy. Jimmy stumbles to his feet.    Looks at the Tall Man. TALL MAN Walk over and hand him the keys. Slow and easy. Jimmy takes out the car keys.    Crosses to Hallenbeck. Gives him the keys. HALLENBECK The evidence is in the trunk. TALL MAN Open it.     Slow. "
65.,"CONTINUED: Hallenbeck smiles.    Shakes his head. HALLENBECK I don't think so. He turns and throws the keys as far as he can. They fall out of sight behind a cottage. HALLENBECK Oops.    I guess nobody gets it. TALL MAN You dumb bastard, you're going to pay for that. Jake, open the trunk."
66.,"CONTINUED: SOUND. Fury. Flames, rolling skyward. TINKLE of raining GLASS. Bits of falling metal. All in all, a helluva blast, and meanwhile:"
on ground,Joe rolls over.    Looks at Jimmy.    Jimmy looks at Joe. 
67.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK You alive? JIMMY Don't know yet. They crawl to their feet, inspecting for broken bones. JIMMY The dynamite? HALLENBECK Either that, or we're looking at a major factory recall."
jimmy,"Dead guys... don't make bad jokes, right? HALLENBECK Right. JIMMY So we're alive. HALLENBECK Yeah.    Hooray. He spits blood as SIRENS once more fill the night air, APPROACHING. HALLENBECK Go.   Get out of here. JIMMY What?"
hallenbeck,"Get the fuck out of here, I'll take the heat on this one. Rent a car. Then go home and wait for my call. Do it. Jimmy meets Joe's eyes.    Nods.   Dashes off into the night. CUT TO:"
68.,"CONTINUED: BESSALO Goddammit, this is a police matter, you son of a bitch! I'm sick and fucking tired of sweeping up your dead bodies, Joe, and the next time I see your ugly mug I'm puttin' a bullet in it. You got that? You are off the case, buddy. Is that clear? Hallenbeck stares at him.   Blows smoke.    Says nothing. CUT TO: INT. RENTAL CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT"
hallenbeck,"Forget about him. Look at the guy on the right. JIMMY Sort of familiar. Who is he? HALLENBECK Senator Calvin Baynard. Jimmy draws a sharp breath.   Pause, then: JIMMY Let's go back to the cops.   I'm scared. HALLENBECK Take it easy, kid. It's not so bad. "
69.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY Not so bad. Excuse me, did you just say the words not so bad? You don't understand, Joe, see, if a guy vomits on the sidewalk, you don't say, 'Oh, hey, it's not so bad, there's some ham in there.' It's fucking vomit, okay? This is bad. Hallenbeck nervously lights a cigarette. Stares straight ahead through the windshield.   Begins to talk: HALLENBECK When I was thirty, I was on the President's personal security force. Once night I was on the way home from a late session. I'm on the highway just outside of Georgetown when I see something up ahead."
memory flash,"Another time. Another night. A younger-looking Hallenbeck. Rugged features. Clipped military haircut. He is driving. Down a turnpike, squinting through dense evening mist. Up ahead, a shape materializes out of the fog:"
wrecked car,is lying upside down in a pool of shattered glass. He SCREECHES to a stop.
another angle,"In a dream-like SLOW MOTION, he approaches the overturned car. There are two dead bodies inside. A woman. A little boy. In the window, a stuffed Garfield doll clings with suction cups to the remaining glass. The furry cat is splattered with blood. "
70.,CONTINUED: HALLENBECK  It was a high-speed collision. Both cars were totaled. The woman and the boy were dead. The driver of the other car wasn't.
staggering drunk,"is weaving toward Hallenbeck. Leaving behind his crumpled Mercedes. He wears an $800 suit. Tan Cordovan loafers.   Silk tie. DRUNK Fuckin' bitch... She got in front of me, man. Shit. My fuckin' car. Stupid bitch wrecked my car... He stumbles toward Hallenbeck, eyes attempting to focus. DRUNK Do you know who I am...? I'm Louis Baynard, my father is Calvin D. Baynard, man. Call my father, he'll take care of it. The man lurches to a stop in front of Hallenbeck. Clutching at Joe's lapels. Wheezing liquor fumes. He presses a hundred dollar bill into Joe's hand. DRUNK You'll tell 'em what happened, right...? Bitch swerved in front of me, man. Wrecked my fuckin' Mercedes. Right...?"
71.,"CONTINUED: The younger Hallenbeck stands on the highway of eight years past, staring at the Drunk with fierce, blazing eyes as we -- SNAP BACK TO:"
72.,"INT. PLUSH BEDROOM - NIGHT A tall, thin, almost effeminate MAN is seated on a couch. High cheekbones. A shock of blond hair. Glittering, malignant eyes. He is directing a pornographic film."
pretty girl,"is bound hand and foot to the posts of a lavishly appointed bed. Around her, the room is filled with Kleig lights. Reflectors. Camera equipment. The girl is scowling furiously.    She speaks to the director:"
girl,"I want the sheets changed, Milo. MILO "
73.,"CONTINUED: MILO Not at all, dearest. It's what's known as a snuff film. The hulking man pulls the starter cord.        The SAW ROARS to life. GIRL Oh God Milo please oh God oh no please Miloooo!! A smile twitches Milo's upper lip. MILO Easy, Pablo.   She's not a piece of meat. He exits.    Closes a sound-proofed door behind him."
74.,CONTINUED: MARCON  And then you'll be handling it personally.
75.,"CONTINUED: She still won't look at him. The two men cross to the kitchen. Hallenbeck opens the refrigerator, takes out some lunchmeat. HALLENBECK She's pissed off because I wouldn't let her go out on a date with her friend Billy. DARIAN I missed the biggest party of the year. JIMMY Why couldn't she go?"
hallenbeck," It's chocolate chip, your favorite. DARIAN I don't care.    You're an asshole."
76.,"CONTINUED: DARIAN What're you gonna do, ground me some more? HALLENBECK Hey, you want it, you got it, lady. DARIAN Thank you, asshole. HALLENBECK You're grounded for a week. DARIAN Yes, sir, asshole."
hallenbeck,"That's two. You wanna play this game? I love this game. DARIAN Just leave me alone.  He thinks he's fuckin' Ward Cleaver. HALLENBECK All right, that's it. You wanna be a gutter mouth? You wanna sound like your mother, well that's terrific. Christ, all day long I don't take enough abuse, I gotta listen to shit from you! JIMMY Hey, Joe, take it easy..."
hallenbeck,"Don't you tell me how to talk to my kid. DARIAN All I wanted was to go to a party, but Pop here thinks I'm out to get laid. HALLENBECK Go for it, kiddo. All the dirty words. Come on, shock me. Go ahead. DARIAN Sure thing, you dumb fuck-up. "
77.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK All right, I've had it. Go to your room. Or I will whip your behind. DARIAN You'd probably like it. Hallenbeck takes her by the arm and drags her out of the chair. Toward her room. HALLENBECK Goddammit, you are my daughter and you will respect me, got that? You got it? You don't ever call me a fuck-up. DARIAN Why shouldn't I, Mom calls you that all the time. That stops him.   He looks at her, stricken. HALLENBECK Your mother called me a fuck-up...? When? DARIAN On the phone to Uncle Jay. HALLENBECK Uncle Jay? Ohh, Christ, I'm a fuck-up, but Uncle Jay, now there's a real stand-up guy. Shit, the bastard cheats on his tax form, I'm surprised he hasn't done time! Why don't you ask your mother why Mister Wonderful isn't in jail for tax evasion? DARIAN "
78.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK No. Anything that much fun, I'd want to do myself. JIMMY I think we could both use a drink. Hallenbeck   crosses to a cabinet, breaks out a bottle of Seagrams.    Swigs.  Hands it to Jimmy. As Jimmy drinks, he notices   a photo on the wall: Hallenbeck shaking hands with   George Bush. JIMMY That's you?"
hallenbeck,"Yeah.    That's me. JIMMY You look like the dad on 'The Brady Bunch.' HALLENBECK Yeah, I was a regular Boy Scout. Joe starts to fix a sandwich.      Jimmy takes nips from the bottle. JIMMY So.    You gonna get a divorce? HALLENBECK Don't know. He bites into the sandwich.      Not really tasting it."
jimmy,"You don't like women much, do you, Joe? HALLENBECK "
79.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY Horseshit, he was a scumbag private eye. HALLENBECK What am I, Jimmy? JIMMY He tried to get you killed. HALLENBECK Friends can't be perfect. "
80.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Because it's easier than paying the tax, Junior. JIMMY Ooooooh.     Very deep. HALLENBECK So deep I don't know what the fuck it means. JIMMY It means another drink is required. He raises the bottle."
jimmy,"Alex the accountant. He drinks.   Hallenbeck frowns, watching him. HALLENBECK Is Alex your accountant? JIMMY No.  But he could have been. "
81.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY  No. He had to die, Joe.     Don't you see?"
hallenbeck,Why did he have to die? JIMMY  Because he came out of me. He puts aside the bottle.    Scowls. JIMMY I'm gonna borrow your shower. He exits.    Hallenbeck watches him go.     Says nothing.
82.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY Joe, man, you don't get it -- HALLENBECK Shut up. He picks up the vial of powder. HALLENBECK This is what you went looking for in Cory's apartment, isn't it? You found this when you found that envelope. He crosses to the toilet.    Jimmy cries out."
jimmy,"Joe, please! Joe drops the vial in the water. Flushes. Jimmy darts forward. Joe shoves him back. JIMMY You stupid bastard, do you know what you've done? That was a thousand bucks' worth of shit! HALLENBECK You got it, son. I'm just mixing it in with all the other shit.  Get the fuck out of my house. Now. JIMMY You don't understand."
hallenbeck,"I said, get out. I'll break your fucking neck, kiddo. Jimmy glares at him.    Coldly defiant. JIMMY Go ahead, tough guy. Go ahead. "
83.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY Oh, sure, Dudley fucking Do-Right, you stand there and judge me, and, meanwhile, you never had your old lady die on you, did you, pal?? And your fucking kid?? And I said to God, 'Hey, buddy, what gives? I go to church, I give to the United Way, what is this dead wife and kid shit...?' And he didn't say nothin', Joe. He grabs a towel.   Scrubs savagely at his wet torso. JIMMY And then I lose my job, my fucking life, okay, and why...? You know why? Because I gambled. Whoa, hold on, stop the presses, Jimmy gambled, well shit, of course I gambled, everybody does, and the fucking league knows it! He advances on Joe, trembling with anger. JIMMY Why, Joe? Why is there an injury report in pro football, huh...? Nobody else has a fucking injury report, but the N.F.L. does, so the fucking gamblers will know the spread! Marcon... the commissioner ... those fucking hypocrites... killed the last thing I could do, Joe...! I can't do anything... anymore."
84.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK When you're through feeling sorry for yourself, the front door's that way. JIMMY  You're a total bastard. HALLENBECK You brought cocaine in my house. End of story. Jimmy is silent.   He stands.     Exits into the hall."
darian,"But, Dad -- ! HALLENBECK Go to bed.   This guy's not signing anything. DARIAN Aw, come off it. HALLENBECK Forget it, Darian. "
85.,"CONTINUED: Jimmy walks past her to the front door. Stops with his hand on the knob. Turns. JIMMY I never shaved points, Joe.     I never did. Joe is silent.   Stone-faced. JIMMY If you want my help, I'm at the Casa Loma Apartments on Ventura. He exits. Shuts the door behind him. Darian goes into her room, fuming. Shuts the door."
86.,"ANOTHER ANGLE - FRONT DOOR Down the hall to the front door.   Flings it open, pissed off. HALLENBECK Goddammit, Jimmy, I told you -- ! It isn't Jimmy. Standing on the porch is a tall, thin man with blond hair. The man removes a TASER GUN from his overcoat. MILO Good morning, Joseph. He FIRES point-blank. The electrode hits Hallenbeck in the chest. A CRACKLE of electric current. Hallenbeck jerks spastically. The world spirals away. He plunges down into darkness. CUT TO:"
87.,AT CORNER NEWSSTAND Jimmy buys a paper. Trudges along Ventura Boulevard. Huddled against the chill.
pablo,"Good morning, Jimmy. JIMMY Who are you, and how the fuck do you know my name? CHET "
88.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY Who? PABLO Don't play dumb, shithead. You were with him last night at the club. CHET Mr. Marcon sent us to teach you a lesson, Jimmy. Something about keeping your big coked-up nose out of his fucking business. PABLO Get ready, kid. This one's an E ticket. And, with that, they grab Jimmy under the arms. Carry him across the sidewalk to a plywood fence. JIMMY Please, guys, don't do this... Jesus Christ, I was just her boyfriend, I swear to God, please! They toss Jimmy over the fence."
another angle,"Not a terrible fate, under normal circumstances. In this case, however -- A fifty-foot drop..."
89.,"CONTINUED: His million-dollar arm.    His throwing arm. He clutches at cracked ribs, screaming: JIMMY Oh, God, my arm, my fucking arm, oh Jesus Christ!!! He kneels in the muddy water, rocking back and forth."
90.,"CONTINUED: McCASKEY Okay. So how come Hallenbeck's neighbor claims that Miller's car was parked there all night, in the same spot? Bessalo sits bolt upright.   Eyes glazed.   Wheels turning. BESSALO He lied.   Why did he lie...? Realization hits him like a thunderbolt. BESSALO Shit.   Miller was fucking his wife. McCASKEY What? BESSALO That's why the car was there, Miller was fucking Hallenbeck's wife, Hallenbeck just got back from out of town, remember?  Christ, Joe wasted the bastard himself! He stabs a button on the phone.   Barks into the receiver: BESSALO I want an A.P.B. out on Joe Hallenbeck. Now. Find him and if he resists arrest, shoot the bastard."
91.,JOE HALLENBECK'S UNCONSCIOUS FACE Weathered.   Sallow.   Dark circles under the eyes.
hand,comes INTO FRAME and slaps him.    Hard. Rocks his head to one side.
92.,"CONTINUED: He starts pawing his coat pockets, looking for a cigarette. In the corner, Pablo chuckles: PABLO Milo warned us to watch out for this guy. Chet is seething.     He glares at Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck yawns. CHET Fuck that. Look at him. He's nothin'. Guy's a piece of shit."
93.,"CONTINUED: He hands Hallenbeck another smoke. Hallenbeck puts it between his lips. HALLENBECK I need a light.  And if you touch me again... I'll kill you. A pregnant pause. The challenge hangs in the air. Slowly, Chet takes the lighter from his pocket. Pablo looks on, a smile twisting his features. Hallenbeck leans forward for a light. Chet extends his arm -- And slugs Hallenbeck in the face again. Rocks him. Chet howls with laughter. Pablo grins. CHET Baby!   Two for two! The laughter continues. Hallenbeck takes a deep breath. Stands up. Strikes with a flattened palm. Breaks Chet's nose. Drives it up into the brain. Chet stands, pole-axed. Blinks once. Pitches over dead."
94.,"CONTINUED: At that moment, a door opens, and Milo enters. Slick. Well-dressed. Utterly composed. MILO Is there a problem? PABLO  He killed Chet, Milo. The mother- fucker just killed him! Milo looks toward Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck says nothing. Instead, he calmly leans forward and picks up Chet's lighter from the carpet. Lights his cigarette. Blows smoke."
milo,"You took an awful risk. Pablo here could have shot you dead. HALLENBECK If you wanted me dead, you'd have already killed me. MILO Yes, that's true. "
95.,"CONTINUED: MILO Yes.   I'm the bad guy. HALLENBECK And you've got the gun, and I'm supposed to tremble in fear, something like that? MILO Something like that. HALLENBECK Fine. I'll start trembling in a minute. Mind if I have a drink first?"
96.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK You're pretty calm for a man whose team is three and six on the year. MARCON They're having some problems. HALLENBECK They stink. Marcon's composure falters, but only for a moment. MARCON I'm glad you're here, Joe. We got a few things to discuss."
marcon,"This year, the final blow: the N.F.L. votes to decertify the Players Organization. Eliminates the draft, reduces all athletes to free agents. Reduces football, once and for all, to commerce. To greed, you follow? HALLENBECK When do I say the Pledge of Allegiance? Marcon looks directly at Hallenbeck. "
97.,"CONTINUED: MARCON Do you know how many ratings points Monday Night Football lost this year? Per week? An average of two point eight. HALLENBECK Oh, for Chrissake. You're telling me this whole thing is about TV ratings? MARCON People have stopped watching, Joe! Everybody's turning the channel, they're still looking for heroes, you follow? Guys like you. Milo here tells me you took a bullet for the President, jumped in front of a sniper rifle. Hallenbeck reacts, startled.   Looks at Milo. MILO We took the liberty of researching your background. MARCON How about it, Joe? Is it truth or hype? HALLENBECK "
98.,"CONTINUED: MARCON Exactly. Gambling.  Shit, that's what this is about! You're bribing United States senators. Paying them to pass legislation --"
marcon,"-- Legalizing football gambling in all fifty states. Exactly. HALLENBECK Attendance goes up again.   TV ratings go up again. MARCON You got it, son. The networks are happy. I'm happy. Everybody's happy. HALLENBECK Before we get too fucking happy, let's get a couple things straight: first, I'm not your fucking son, and second... why am I still alive? Marcon stops pacing.   Sighs and sits down facing Hallenbeck."
marcon,"It's like this, Joe: everything was going great until a couple weeks ago, and then I hit a snag: Senator Calvin Baynard. HALLENBECK "
99.,"CONTINUED: HALLEBECK Baynard? Are you nuts? The guy's so crooked he shits slinkies. MARCON Allow me to clarify: I offered him the bribe, and he turned it down because he wanted more money. HALLENBECK  Thank God. For a minute there I felt hell freezing over. Did he ask for more than a million?"
marcon,"Does the Pope shit in the woods? He wants two million or he'll blow the lid off my whole plan. I don't feel like paying no two mil, so basically that good ole' boy's gotta die. HALLENBECK Taking off a U.S. senator, that's pretty ballsy. Even for an asshole like you. MARCON Oh, I'm not going to kill Baynard, Joe. HALLENBECK Who is? Marcon says nothing.   Just looks at Hallenbeck and smiles. HALLENBECK Oh, shit. He rubs tired eyes. HALLENBECK I'm the perfect fall guy. Everyone and his uncle Max knows I hate Baynard. MARCON "
100.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Any particular reason I should go along with this prize-winning scheme? MARCON  Just one. He motions to Milo, who disappears through a doorway. Reappears a moment later. He's got Joe's wife."
sarah,"Yes. MILO That's a temporary condition, Joseph. As you may be aware, there are distributors in Mexico who positively crave snuff films. And unless you do every fucking thing Mr. Marcon tells you... your wife will make her motion picture debut. He meets Joe's murderous gaze... and smiles."
101.,"INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Jimmy is seated, shirtless, on a metal examining table. His ribs are taped. His arm in a cast. Two men loom over him, sour expressions on their faces: Sergeants McCaskey and Bessalo. Jimmy shakes his head, exasperated: JIMMY Look, I'll say it again for the cheap seats: I don't know anything and I can't help you. Okay? Can I go now?"
bessalo,"We did.   Where is he? JIMMY For Chrissake, I just met the guy.  Look, Sergeant. I don't give a shit about Joe Hallenbeck. I just busted my throwing arm and I'm in a real pissy mood, so you got two choices: either charge me with something or let me the fuck outta here. He glares defiantly at Bessalo. CUT TO:"

pablo,"approaches along the dock, looking lean and mean in an Izod shirt. He stops in front of Sarah and Joe Hallenbeck. "
103.,"CONTINUED: They are seated on the dock. Each handcuffed to a metal railing. Pablo kneels and unfastens Joe's cuffs. PABLO Get up. HALLENBECK Go fuck yourself. Pablo delivers a savage kick to Hallenbeck's ribs. Hallenbeck gasps in pain. HALLENBECK I meant that... in a good way... Pablo hauls him to his feet.    Props him against the railing. PABLO Time for a little payback, Joe. Call it a service to dear departed Chet. He slams a fist into Hallenbeck's middle. Sarah cries out in alarm. PABLO How's that feel, fuckhead? HALLENBECK  I'm asshole... she's fuckhead. And with that, Pablo lets him have it."
104.,"CONTINUED: Pablo gives Joe a last swift kick. Spits on him. Hallenbeck vomits. Lies bleeding on the dock. Sarah crawls over to him. As far as the cuffs will allow. Cradles his head in her lap. HALLENBECK Don't... look at me... SARAH Shhh. It's okay, Joe. I'm here, it's okay.  I love you, Joe."
105.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Sorry... I'm fresh out. SARAH I'm scared, Joe. Get me out of this. HALLENBECK Must be my trick ear. Sounded like you said, 'Get me out of this.' SARAH You can take these guys, Joe."
hallenbeck,"I've got cracked ribs and a concussion. SARAH Save me, Joe.    Be a hero. HALLENBECK I don't believe in heroes. SARAH That's no excuse. He stares up at her for a moment.      Then, through bloody lips: HALLENBECK Fuck you, Sarah... And he smiles."
106.,"CONTINUED: PABLO Stay down, fucker. Don't you move. At that moment, Milo comes striding down the dock. Whistling cheerfully. MILO Careful, Pablo. We don't want to get Mrs. Hallenbeck all excited in front of hubby. He squats next to Joe. MILO Hello, Joseph, guess what? Time to go, and remember: you follow orders, or the missus pays the price. HALLENBECK You're gonna kill us both anyway. MILO Perhaps. But there are ways to die, and then there are... ways to die. Capisce? You determine your wife's fate. He yanks Hallenbeck to his feet. Propels him toward the boat. As her husband is being led away, Sarah calls out: SARAH Joe...!"
107.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK I'll be back.  That's a promise. Milo clubs Joe in the head with his pistol. MILO You're wasting my time, Joseph. Let's go. Hallenbeck turns. Dirty. Tired.        Unshaven.   Bloody. He looks at Milo... and grins: HALLENBECK If you touch me again... I'll kill you. They stare into each other's eyes. Hallenbeck does not give an inch. Milo hits him again."
108.,"ON SHIPBOARD - MILO MILO It's Milo, sir. We're now underway and should be lying off Catalina within two hours. MARCON Good boy, Milo. The commissioner's party starts at six. I'll put in a token appearance around six-thirty. MILO Very good, sir. MARCON Any problems with Hallenbeck?"
milo,"No, we're getting along famously. MARCON Glad to hear it. No fuckups, Milo. I want him deep-sixed. MILO I assure you, neither he nor the senator will see another sunrise. MARCON Christ, Milo, how come you always have to talk like a fruit? MILO If it annoys you, I    could always adopt a Texas drawl,    though I'm afraid I don't know    any stories about fucking pigs.     Sir."
marcon,"Cows, Milo.   Never pigs. MILO I'll remember that, sir. He hangs up. Marcon replaces the receiver and chuckles. MARCON Goddamn fruitcake. He turns, and suddenly we realize he's not alone in the room: a STRANGE MAN is seated in the shadows off to one side. His face is obscured... Marcon addresses him: "
109.,"CONTINUED: MARCON So far, so good. The Man in the corner nods, then speaks. As he does, we notice he has a speech impediment; it sounds like he's talking with his mouth full. STRANGE MAN We've worked too hard, Con. There's no margin for error. MARCON Take it easy, buddy.   We're covered."
strange man,"You're using the first team, yes? MARCON Absolutely.  Actually, I have no choice. STRANGE MAN How's that? MARCON Fuckin' Hallenbeck killed the second and third teams."
110.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY No, honey. Not now. There's some big shots involved in this mess, and it's my word against theirs. If I blab to the cops, your mom and dad will disappear and they'll never find the bodies. "

113.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK I'd go off and suck some cock and leave him the fuck alone. Milo studies Hallenbeck the way a museum curator might study a new species of fish. MILO It occurs to me, Joseph, that I would very much like to hear you scream. HALLENBECK Come again?"
milo,"You're so cool, aren't you? So... if you'll pardon the expression... hard-boiled. I'd like, just once, to hear you scream in pain. HALLENBECK Play some rap music. Milo chuckles, shakes his head. MILO Fascinating. HALLENBECK When do I kill Baynard? MILO  You're not really going to kill anyone. HALLENBECK I'm not? MILO No. He leans forward. MILO You're going to be framed for the senator's murder... when they find your corpse at the scene of the crime."
114.,"EXT. PRIVATE DOCK - NIGHT Boats, lots of them. Sportfishers. Yachts. Floating boats. Money, money, everywhere, and plenty of drinks to drop."

darian,"Are you really a drug addict? JIMMY I was.   I kicked the habit. DARIAN When? JIMMY This morning.    Stay here. He swings over the side, onto the dock. DARIAN Don't let them break your other arm. JIMMY Thanks, kid.    You're a fuckin' inspiration."
116.,"CONTINUED: MILO Baynard will not leave his boat. One of his men will board us, and inspect the contents of the suitcase. This suitcast. He opens one of the cases.   Hallenbeck stares."
hallenbeck,"That sounds lovely, but how is my body gonna get charred? With a flourish, Milo pulls aside a tablecloth. Under the table is a five gallon can of gasoline. MILO Maybe I'll get to hear you scream, after all... Just then, one of Milo's crew sticks his head in the door. CREW MEMBER You better get up here, we got a problem."
117.,"EXT. YACHT - ON DECK - NIGHT Milo's yacht is anchored about a half mile offshore. Island lights blink in the distance. Fog rolls in. Milo emerges from the cabin onto the deck. Crosses to the railing, looks down at:"
fishing boat,"bobbing in the water about thirty yards away. A FISHERMAN is waving his arms. Hailing them. Beside him, his wife and seventeen-year-old son. FISHERMAN Hey! Buddy, I got a cracked engine casing, I'm dead in the water! Can I get a tow? Milo swears under his breath.    Calls out: MILO I'm sorry, sir. This boat is Island Security, we're under strict orders to stay within this sector. FISHERMAN Aw, shit!     Look, it'll take ten minutes! MILO I'm sorry, we can't help you. FISHERMAN Goddammit, now I gotta call the Coast Guard! Milo's crewman steps up to the rail.    Speaks urgently: CREW MEMBER Milo, he's gonna bring the Coast Guard down on top of us. Milo ponders for maybe three seconds.    Then he calls out: MILO Excuse me.     Sir? The Fisherman turns.    His family beside him. MILO Fuck you, sir. "
118.,CONTINUED: He reaches under his Windbreaker. Pulls out an Ingram model MACHINE GUN. OPENS FIRE. The entire family is blown away. WOOD SPLINGERS POP and fly. GLASS SHATTERS. The bodies topple like broken toys. Milo ceases fire.   Turns to his crewman. MILO Problem solved. Get over there and put the bodies below where they can't be seen. He saunters away as if nothing unusual has occurred.
119.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY The Senator's here, and he's leaving by the back door. I'm gonna follow him. He keys the ignition. JIMMY Get off the boat. DARIAN Fuck you, man. No way. JIMMY Darian, Goddammit --"

It happen in less than a second: the built-in counter rotates into the wall, only to be replaced by an indentical counter. Identical half-finished jigsaw puzzle. Identical coffee cup. And, of course, the identical suitcase. The indignant Aide turns around, pat-down concluded. AIDE Okay?   Satisfied?"
back topside,"Baynard's man emerges onto the deck, carrying the suitcase. Steps over the rail, crossing to the Senator's boat. Gives a thumbs up to the men waiting there. They cast off the lines.   Freeing the two boats. INT. MILO'S YACHT - BRIDGE Milo watches, tense. As the lines are freed, he says:"
milo,"Hard to starboard, get us out of here. Back off a hundred yards and wait for the blast."
123.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY All we're doing is burning gas. Sorry, kid, I'm turning back. The words are barely out of his mouth when he hears a throbbing NOISE, growing louder... Darian looks up puzzled. DARIAN Do you hear that -- ? And with that --"
124.,"ANOTHER ANGLE Jimmy's BOAT ROARS out of the fog... And suddenly he's in a world of shit. Less than fifty yards to port is Milo's yacht. Fifty years to starboard is the Senator's Marlineer. JIMMY Oh, wow.    We're fucked. He GUNS the ENGINE.     Spins the wheel, banks to port."

126.,"CONTINUED: Works his bound hands over his knees so they're now tied in front of him. Everybody's topside; for the moment, at least, he is forgotten. He half crawls, half lurches over to the kitchen nook. Worms beneath the table... awkward, desperate... Drags out the can of gasoline. Tries to unscrew the top.   No dice.   Can't get a grip. Finally, in frustration, he tips the can on its side. Brings his legs up in the air -- Slams them down on the can. Over and over until, with a metallic pop -- ! it bursts. Floods gasoline over the carpet, meanwhile:"
back topside,"Milo's yacht is plowing ahead, gaining on Jimmy's Hatteras. The crew members take up positions on the prow. OPEN FIRE."

127.,"CONTINUED: A WHOOSH of combustion.    It bursts into flame. Joe swivels around. Balancing on his backside. Thrusts his legs into the fire. Strains. Pulls. Sweat runs in rivers. Until the ropes binding his legs snap. He lurches to his feet, lets free. Now there's only one problem: He's on fire. The legs of his pants are soaked with gas. Flames race up his legs. He plunges headlong up the stairs."

darian,"spots him first. Sees her father bobbing like a cork in the ocean, screams: DARIAN Daddy!! Jimmy whirls around, startled. JIMMY Shit.    I don't believe it. DARIAN Do something!     Hurry! "
128.,"CONTINUED: Jimmy spins the wheel. Banks hard to port. Brings the boat around in an arc. Yells to Darian: JIMMY Keep the wheel like this!   Don't let it move! She grabs the wheel. Jimmy bends down. Opens a compart- ment. Takes out the boat's anchor. Metal hook, attached to seventy yards of chain. He hefts it like a grappling hook. JIMMY Third and long, baby, lets' go..."
another angle,"Hallenbeck thrusts forward, hooks his bound hands around the passing anchor and whoosh -- !"
129.,"CONTINUED: She collapses, weeping, atop her father. Hugs him for all she's worth. HALLENBECK What the hell's she doing here?? DARIAN I stowed away... GUNFIRE splits the air. Reminds them they're not out of the woods."
jimmy's boat,"Hallenbeck staggers to his feet. HALLENBECK Get below, Darian. And stay there. He stumbles into the wheelhouse.   Dazed.   Barely conscious. JIMMY Got any ideas? HALLENBECK Yeah. Go really fast and hope they don't catch us. "
130.,"CONTINUED: And then a shape materializes off to port: Milo's yacht. Running alongside. Drawing closer. Hallenbeck wrestles the wheel. No dice. The yacht draws ever closer... men on deck... machine guns... Joe looks over... and his face tells the story: HALLENBECK We're dead. Except, just then, a strange thing happens: Milo's yacht veers off to the left. Away from Hallenbeck. Jimmy stares, dumbfounded. JIMMY What the fuck? They're peeling off. Why? A pause... then it hits Joe like a thunderbolt: HALLENBECK 'Cause they got sonar, that's why! Hard to port! JIMMY Port? HALLENBECK Left, Goddammit. The boat slews to the left, as, from out of the fog --"
131.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY We're on half power, we lost an engine!"
jimmy,"swears again.   Bangs his fist. JIMMY We're sitting ducks. They got sonar. They can find us. HALLENBECK Kill the running lights and radio the Coast Guard. Jimmy flicks off the lights. Grabs the mike. As he does, a VIBRATING RUMBLE fills the cockpit, causing him to pause... and then stare in shock as their boat emerges from the fog -- And Air One hovers directly overhead. JIMMY Fuck me. The two men watch, helpless, as the helicopter descends, the Co-Pilot taking aim with a LAWS rocket. HALLENBECK Get down! They both hit the floor.    Hands over their heads -- And then the pilot makes a costly error: He descends right into the path of Milo's yacht. With no warning whatsoever, the boat comes bursting out of the fog -- PLOWS right INTO the HELICOPTER. Second number one: The boat pierces the chopper, rips it to shreds. Second number two: The whole boat-slash-chopper mix erupts in a shower of wood and fiberglass. Turns night into day."
132.,JIMMY AND JOE are still huddled on the floor. Pause. They look up. Bewildered. There was a big light... Big noise... Why aren't they dead?

A hand reaches in, lightning quick. Grabs the can, throws it back in his face. As he jerks backward, blinded, the hand knocks him cold."
hallenbeck,Let's get him inside and tie him up. JIMMY Are you crazy? That's a cop!     You don't punch cops! HALLENBECK I forgot.    Hurry up.
137.,"CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Use these. They're shredders. Equipped with an explosive charge. When you fire the gun, they spray on impact. Take out anything within ten yards. JIMMY What are you gonna use? HALLENBECK A little souvenir... He reaches into the closet. Pulls out a sniper rifle. The rifle. The one responsible for the puckered scar on his chest. HALLENBECK Go bring the car around."
138.,"PAD AND PAPER as they're placed in front of Hallenbeck. He is seated on the bed. Three guns covering him. Beside him sits Furry Tom, grinning his stuffed-toy grin. PABLO Are you a literate man, Joe? HALLENBECK I got a subscription to Jugs magazine. PABLO That's good. See, Joe, what you're gonna do, you're gonna write a little story."
139.,"CONTINUED: Pablo draws his pistol. PUMPS TWO SHOTS into the unconscious cop in the corner. PABLO That one. HALLENBECK You son of a bitch...! Pablo is making a big mistake, but he doesn't know it. He is fueling Joe Hallenbeck's rage. Pity the fool. Hallenbeck regards him with dead, lifeless eyes. A thoroughly unnerving stare."
140.,"CONTINUED: Pablo can't help it.   He bursts out laughing. PABLO That's amazing, man! Hallenbeck picks up Furry Tom. Inserts his hand, makes the furry head bob back and forth. HALLENBECK  Hey, Mr. Hallenbeck, they're laughin' at me. That's not very nice. By now, all three hoods are in hysterics."
hallenbeck,"Are you mad, Furry Tom? HALLENBECK "
141.,"CONTINUED: His Presidential Medal of Valor. Shiny medal. Shiny ribbon. His name... It hits him quite suddenly: The medal has sharp edges. With the last of his strength, he plucks it from the wall. Drives it into Pablo's throat. The big man stumbles backward. Eyes wide. Gurgling. He thrashes, the red-white-blue ribbon flapping obscenely from his gushing neck. Drops to the dusty carpet.    Dies."
marcon,"I remember how much you hated the pain... You got hooked on Demerol, didn't you...? I'll make a deal with you. Tell me who you talked to, and I'll give you all the painkillers you can swallow. JIMMY Nobody knows. Just... just me... and Hallenbeck... MARCON Now, see, I'd love to believe you. But we are talking about the future of my football team. "

Got one of yours, you know.  Who'd you talk to, Jimmy? JIMMY Nobody... Marcon raises the poker. Brings it down on Jimmy's broken arm."
143.,"CONTINUED: MARCON He's nothing, he can't hurt us. Take him somewhere and kill him. HARDGUY Yes, sir. The Hardguy crosses the room.      Grips Jimmy by the shoulders. With a soft SPIT of sound, his forehead blooms crimson. He collapses, lifeless. At his desk, Marcon whirls, stunned, as:"
joe hallenbeck,"steps through the French doors behind him. He resembles nothing human. A demon in black. Eyes burning. Gun held loosely. An extension of his arm. Marcon reaches for the button to summon help. HALLENBECK Don't. He jams the rifle barrel into Marcon's throat, nearly crushing his larynx. Hisses: HALLENBECK The gun is silenced, I'll fuckin' kill you. Where's my wife? MARCON I... I don't remember, I... Joe shoves on the gun.   The barrel chokes him. HALLENBECK My wife. Grabs a pen.   Shoves it in Marcon's hand. HALLENBECK The address.    Now! MARCON It's... Milo's film studio... HALLENBECK Write it down, dumbfuck. "
144.,"CONTINUED: He speaks over his shoulder: HALLENBECK Jimmy, you okay...? Jimmy stirs. JIMMY Hurts like hell. Marcon finishes writing. Hallenbeck snatches up the address. Stows it in his pocket. HALLENBECK Okay, Connie, you're gonna walk us out of here, nice and easy, got it?  Can you walk, Jimmy? JIMMY Yeah... I think so -- Joe, behind you...! Too late.    A revolver is cocked a foot from Joe's head. STRANGE MAN Drop it. It's the same odd voice we heard earlier. The man with the speech impediment. HALLENBECK You drop it, asshole, or I kill Marcon."
145.,"LOUIS BAYNARD Son of the late senator. The right side of his face doesn't quite match the left. The muscles don't work. Hallenbeck recovers his composure. As Jimmy climbs to his feet, Joe walks over and stands next to him. Two gunmen appear behind them, covering the rear. HALLENBECK Well, Goddamn. How's the head, Lou? BAYNARD  Aside from permanent facial neuralgia, just lovely."
hallenbeck,"Next time, Lou, just say no. JIMMY Shit. This is the drunk guy you slugged, look what you did to his face! Marcon, meanwhile, is positively livid.   He snaps at Baynard: MARCON You son of a bitch, you were gonna let him kill me! BAYNARD Nothing more or less than you'd do for me, Conrad.  I never thought I'd see you again, Joe."
hallenbeck,"Speaking of which, what the fuck are you doing here? BAYNARD Call it a financial partnership. For a price, I agreed to connect Mr. Marcon to the necessary people in Washington. HALLENBECK In other words, you dropped your father's name a bunch of times. "

147.,"CONTINUED: Behind them, the two hardguys COCK their GUNS. Jimmy sweats. He's scared shitless underneath. Hallenbeck clears his throat: HALLENBECK You know of course, Connie, that you're a dead man. Marcon holds up his hand. MARCON Wait. The gunmen lower their weapons."
marcon,"Let's humor this asshole.     What are you talking about? HALLENBECK  Nothing much, just that I made a phone call from the boat on the way in. MARCON You called the cops? Fuck it, they can't prove a thing. HALLENBECK Oh, but I didn't call the cops.      I called the mob. Marcon stares at him.   Blinks."
hallenbeck,"See, Connie, every year, the mob rakes in two and a half billion from football bookmaking. If you succeed in making gambling legal, all that money goes to the government. "
148.,"CONTINUED: MARCON He's bluffing. He's not connected to the mob, what a load of horseshit. Nice try, asshole.  Then there's the matter of two million dollars. Or didn't you know that watertight suitcases float...? He once again looks Marcon in the eye."
hallenbeck,"I've got your money, Connie. Stashed in the back of a rented Subaru. We'll take you to it. MARCON "
149.,"CONTINUED: JIMMY It's stashed in my shorts. MARCON  All right. Slow and easy. JIMMY Sure.   Slow and easy. Jimmy reaches inside his jeans. Slowly, cautiously pulls something out, concealed in his fist. We see, but Marcon doesn't: It's a shredder shell. He holds it in his fist."
jimmy,"Promise you'll let me go. MARCON Hell with that, son. Hand it over or I'll have you kneecapped. JIMMY Oh, yeah? Well, that's too bad. See, it's one of those new plastic keys. The kind that melt...? And, with that, he hurls it into the fire. So fast that nobody can see just what he threw. JIMMY I guess nobody gets the money. The two hardguys rush to the fireplace."
marcon,"Pull it out of there! One of them grabs a pair of tongs -- and the SHREDDER EXPLODES. Sprays the two hardguys.    Cuts them to ribbons.

Baynard sags against the mantel. Collapses, dead. ECHOES. Silence.   Jimmy and Joe are alone with three corpses. Jimmy snatches up a pistol. Joe slings the sniper rifle over his shoulder. Stares at Jimmy:"

A pause, then Sarah says: SARAH I remember when we got married... My friends would talk about their husbands. They'd say, 'Oh, my husband is a big-time publisher,' or, 'My husband is a brilliant lawyer...' I used to say, 'My husband can stand over a shotgun victim and eat a ham sandwich without puking.' HALLENBECK Don't knock it. It's a skill. She turns.   Looks into his eyes. SARAH I want to try, Joe.   Do you still want to try? A pause.   He leans in and kisses her tenderly. And, with typically swell timing, a set of headlights rakes across the window, accompanied by the strobing light of a police flasher. HALLENBECK Ahh, shit. Looks like the local constable has come to chat. SARAH Shall we invite him in? HALLENBECK No.   Stay here. I'll deal with it. "

He sprays a BURST of GUNFIRE up at the billboard."
hallenbeck,huddles behind the billboard as the bullets stitch upward. Through the wooden frame. A hot SLUG RIPS through Joe's arm. An eruption of blood. He hisses in pain. Rolls away from the gunfire. Looks around. Desperate. Sees a painter's bucket lying nearby. He counts to three.

Hurls the bucket down at Milo, dashes across the front of the billboard, hard and fast -- BULLETS CHOPPING the board right behind him, blowing holes in Gorgeous's derrierre -- And then Joe does a risky thing: He sprints to the end of the billboard, running full tilt, and he leaps out into space, what the hell is he doing?
