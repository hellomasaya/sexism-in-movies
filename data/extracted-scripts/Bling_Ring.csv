rebecca,Let's go shopping!
nicki," I am a firm believer in Karma, and I think this situation was attracted into my life as a huge learning lesson for me to grow and expand as a spiritual human being. I see myself being like an Angelina Jolie, but even stronger, pushing even harder for the universe and peace and for the health of the planet. I want to lead a huge                             * charity organization. I want to                           * lead a country for all I know.                            *"

rebecca,"It's fine, it's fine...let's keep going."

rebecca,Shut the fuck up.
marc,Oh shit.  CUT TO:

rob,And she never noticed?
rebecca,"We never take enough for it to be obvious...and c'mon, it's Paris Hilton."
rob,She's so messy.
marc,"I know, right?"
rob,Here we go.
sam,"Oh, shit."

rebecca,"Cool, who's playing?"
chloe,"I don't know, I think some local bands..."
rebecca,"I want to go to Rachel Bilson's, she's in Paris for fashion week."
chloe,Don't you think you should chill out a little bit?
marc,"Yeah, that news thing totally freaked me out."
rebecca,"Nothing happened, there's no way you can tell who that is...C'mon, will you find her house for me, please?"
marc,I don't know.
rebecca,"C'mon, you're my best friend, please. Let's go get some stuff."
rebecca,"We're going to Rachel Bilson's, wanna come?"
rebecca,I don't know.
rebecca,C'mon.
rebecca,"There aren't, just keep your hat on...and chill out. It's fine."

drunk girl,"Yo, Becca."
rebecca,Yo.
drunk girl,I heard you went to Paris Hilton's.
rebecca,Yeah.
drunk girl,And you took some stuff.
rebecca,Lates.
chloe,Whores!
sam,Chloooee.
chloe,Where've you been tonight?

chloe,Sick! Some drunk party girl passing by chimes in.
party girl,You went to Rachel Bilson's?!
nicki,"Yeah, she's in Paris at fashion week. We just went in..."
party girl,Shut the fuck up.
chloe,I'm staying on look out.
marc,"I don't think we should do this. If there are cameras, it's gonna be like Audrina's, it's gonna get out."
rebecca,"C'mon, Lindsay's gone, I wanna do this, this is our opportunity."
marc,"OK, but this is it."
marc,"I don't know, I think we should get out of here."
rebecca,You're already here. You might as well come up and get something for yourself.
rebecca,"Marc, do you like this dress, would this be good on me?"
marc,"Yeah, sure."
rebecca,"Oh my god, this is the dress she wore to the Cosmopolitan opening!"
nicki,"Oh my god, that's so cute."
marc,When are you coming back from Vegas?
rebecca,"I don't know, I'm just going to stay with my dad until things calm down with my mom...I need a change for awhile, I'll call you from there. Will you hold on to some of my stuff for me?"
marc,"Yeah, sure."
debbie,One minute...
man's voice,L.A.P.D. Open the door.
debbie," You need to get dressed, they want you to come outside."
marc,Mom!
debbie,"Whatever it is, we'll figure it out, honey."
cop,Are you Marc Hall?
marc,"Yes... They handcuff Marc. The dogs bark, Marc's mom cries."
cop,"Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to step aside."
laurie,Yes?
cop,Is this the residence of Nicolette Moore?
laurie,"Yes, what is this about?"
cop,We have a warrant to search your house. Everyone needs to come outside.
laurie,"Girls-You need to come downstairs, now."
police officer,"Ma'am, we need you to secure your animals."
emily,What is it?! Police go into her room to search.
police officer,We need you all to leave the premises and wait outside.
police officer,You have the right to remain silent.
nicki,I want a lawyer! Call my lawyer!
emily,What's going on?! Why are they taking her?! Sirens scream as they pull away.
laurie,"Girls, we need to have a prayer circle right now. We need to center ourselves."
laurie,And so it is.
rebecca's mom,"Hello, how can I help you?"
police officer,Is this the home of Rebecca Ahn?
rebecca's mom,"I'm her mother, but she's staying with her father in Nevada. POLICE OFFICER Ma'am, we'll need to get her current address."
ricky,"What the fuck, man..."
marc,"We knew he was out of town through the internet, you'd google his name and see ""Orlando Bloom is shooting a movie, he's with Miranda Kerr in New York."" We walked in, it was unlocked, there was no alarm."
marc,"Yeah, I've never even broken a window."
detective,How did you find the Rolexes?
marc,"We found a safe at the bottom of a closet with the Rolexes and like five thousand dollars...I'll give everything back that I still have, and I'll find a way to repay them, I'm really sorry about what I did."
detective,Did you know Rebecca was leaving the state?
marc,"I just thought she was going to stay at her dad's cause she wasn't getting along with her mom and step dad. DETECTIVE You didn't know she was crossing state lines with stolen property, and leaving you holding the bag?"
marc, I thought she was just visiting her dad.
rebecca,Yes.
detective,Do you understand your rights?
rebecca,Yes.
detective,Do you know why we're at your home serving a search warrant?
rebecca,Yes.
detective,Why do you think we're here?
rebecca,My friend Marc was arrested and he                  * called me from jail and told me the police had done a search warrant at his home.
detective,Do you know why?
rebecca,I've been watching TMZ and they've been saying I'm a `person of interest' in these burglaries.
detective,Were you involved in any of the burglaries to these celebrities?
rebecca,"No, I wasn't."
detective,Is there going to be any property from any of those burglaries in this residence? REBECCA No.
detective,Have you been in any of the celebrity's homes that have been burglarized?
rebecca,No.
detective,Could any of your fingerprints of DNA be found in any of the victim's homes?
rebecca,No.
police officer,"We've located a jacket and jeans that match the description by Lohan, and personal photographs of Paris Hilton."
rebecca,"If I tell you where everything is, would you let me go? Hypothetically let's say I may know where this property is located and who has it, how could that help me? DETECTIVE The detectives on this case are trying to recover hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of property for the victims and I'm sure they would say if your cooperation helped them locate it."
rebecca,"I want to help you out, but I don't want to do anything without talking to my attorney."
detective,Is this your marijuana?
rebecca,"Yes, I have a prescription for it and bought it in California."
detective,You're being arrested for stolen property and L.A.P.D. detectives will be filing charges in their jurisdiction for burglary.
rebecca,Did you speak to any of the victims?
detective,I've spoken to all of the Victims.
rebecca,Really?! What did Lindsay say? CUT TO:
nicki,Oh my god!
laurie,This is crazy.
nicki,"Does this look conservative, is this good?"
sam,If you like a secretary-style hooker.
nicki,Shut Up.                                                *
sam,That's better...you need lower heels.
nicki,"Oh, Yeah, where are my kitten heels...bitch, you're so fucking lucky you weren't on that video..."
laurie,Nicki! Kate from Vanity Fair is here.
kate,What do your parents do?
nicki,"My mom does a lot of things, she's a minister, she's been a masseuse, she's an energy healer...My dad is a director of photography on T.V. shows, he's been in the industry forever...."
kate,And how is Sam related?
nicki,"We've adopted her, we met in ballet class when we were little."
laurie,I was friends with her mother--
nicki,"Mom, this is my interview. I met her when my parents divorced. Now she lives with us, my mom's home schooled us all for a while."
laurie,"The philosophy of `The Secret', it's based on the law of attraction, but my great- grandmother and grandmother both studied this philosophy. It's man's relationship to the Divine, that's what energy science means."
nicki,"Since I was young I learned about every religion. KATE So, Sam was in your ballet class, did she have parents?"
nicki,"She had a dysfunctional background, we both did..."
laurie,And I met her mom--
nicki,Can I talk please?! The reason we related so well is my dad is a recovering alcoholic and Sam's mom is..
laurie,A practicing...
nicki,A practicing drug addict and alcoholic and our moms became best friends and...
laurie,"And then she went off the deep end, she was on the verge--"
nicki,Please! I told you that if you're going to be here you had to be quiet! That's why I didn't want you here because you talk!
kate,"So, basically you took her in."
nicki,"Yes, we took her in about 6 years ago."
shannon,But let's get back to Nicki.
kate,So Adam here told me you do charity work.
nicki,"Yes, we do a lot of stuff through our church, it's Agape Church. LAURIE It's the religious science philosophy being taught at Agape Church."
nicki,"My other sister, Gabby is on a trip with them now helping build homes. And they do a yearly trip to Africa where they build wells and schools for kids."
kate,Which country?
nicki,"Uh, I can't remember exactly which country... We do bake sales and feeding the homeless, that kind of stuff."
kate,"Ok, so it's a little bit of a disconnect with these positive pursuits and what's happening now."
adam,"Nicki, I don't want you to answer that comment."
nicki,I think that I'm a firm... I have a good statement to say.
kate,She can speak generally.
nicki,"I'm not gonna speak about the case, what I was going to say is that I'm a firm believer in karma and I think this situation was attracted into my life as a huge learning lesson for me to grow and expand as a spiritual human being."
laurie,"Yes, she is."
shannon,"We have gotten to know Nicki and her family and we feel Nicki is an extremely focused, honest person who has a lot to provide to the community. "
kate,What's your goal or life plan if you have one?
nicki,"I do, I think my journey is to be a leader and push for peace and for the health of our planet--"
shannon,Nicki has expressed to me a lot of her humanitarianism.
nicki,"It's my main goal. God didn't give me these talents and what I look like to sit around and just be a model or famous. I want to do something people notice, that's why I'm studying business, so I can be a leader and take a stand for people."
marc,"I met Rebecca in school after I moved back and went to Indian Hills, I went there because I had a lot of absences. I didn't want to go to school, I had a lot of self- loathing and anxiety issues, I felt that I was ugly..."
kate,You're not ugly.
marc,"I know I'm not ugly, but I never thought I was an A-list looking guy.I Went to Indian Hills to learn and be with my peers, I felt so self-conscious I didn't look as good as everyone else."
kate,And now you're a star.
marc,"On my Facebook page recently I had 800 friends requests, I accepted them all, I didn't even look at them, then I noticed someone had created a fan page for me. If it had been for something I had done to help the community or benefit something I'd love it, but it's just kind of awkward for me that these people are loving me for something that's looked down on in society... It's kinda showing that America has some sick fascination with a Bonnie and Clyde kind of thing."
reporter,"Could these teenagers be at the center of a celebrity crime spree? Police say they have stolen millions in cash, art and jewelry from the mansions of Orlando Bloom, Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton and countless other stars."
nicki,Can I have a 5 mg adderal.
laurie,"Just remember what we went over with Shannon, they can't prove you were in any of those houses."
nicki,"I know, mom."
emily,"Mom, shouldn't we go?"
nicki,Stop!
emily,Stop what?
nicki,Stop talking.
laurie,She's praying.
nicki,"I know I'm always protected and karma cleanses my journey. Thank you Lord, so much for this truth. And so it is."
laurie,... You rock girl!                                    *
nicki,"This is a very difficult time for myself and my family. Thank you for respecting my privacy, I look forward to my day in court. She does a flirtatious eye roll and saunters past the cameras in her kitten heels."

There were reports that Lindsay was crying, with you being next to her, did you actually hear any of this? NICKI I could hear her crying the first day, which is hard when you're trying to be strong, I just tried to really keep to myself..., I just tried to get through the day , the days are so long you're woken up at"
interviewer,And how'd she look?
nicki,"She got to keep her extensions in, most girls were talking about oh- I had to take my weave out...she was in orange like all of us..."
interviewer,Were you nervous you were next to her because you were accused of being a part of that group that allegedly robbed her house.
nicki,"Yeah, it was hard for me there were tabloids and on T.V.s in there people were watching the story and they were showing the surveillance video and stuff... and little do people know that when that video came out I was actually in contact with her manager to tell her who I believed the people were who robbed her house... and eventually when I'm able to tell my story people will know the truth."
interviewer,So that's nerve wracking she could think you robbed her house.
nicki,"She could've, but you know...yeah...Anyway, you can follow everything about me and my journey at Nickimooreforever dot com."
