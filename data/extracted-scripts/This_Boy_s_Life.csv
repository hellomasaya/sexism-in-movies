for educational,"PURPOSES ONLY  THIS BOY'S LIFE FADE IN:  1   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY                                          1 It is 1957, and we are in the deserts of Utah. TONY BENNETT sings ""Rags to Riches"" on the SOUNDTRACK. Breath-taking scenery stretches out on either side of a highway. The CAMERA MOVES to reveal a Nash Ambassador as it labors up a hill. Twelve cars are caught behind the thirty-mile- per-hour pace. Two cars decide to ignore safety and cross the solid yellow line to pass the pokey car."
2.,"2   CONTINUED:                                              2 CAROLINE  Toby, hush. Let me just... So concentrated on her driving she doesn't even finish her sentence, she nurses the car upward. Finally the car crests the hill and starts down. Caroline sighs with relief. She turns to Toby with a smile. CAROLINE What'd you say? TOBY I said -- for the twentieth time -- if a person promises somebody something, they can't just turn around and take it back. CAROLINE Oh, honey, Jesus. Don't start with that again. TOBY Why not? CAROLINE Because I'm the mother, and I get to tell you what to do every minute of your life 'til you're eighteen. Seriously, we've got no money. I can't buy you the moccasins. TOBY I bet if you'd promised Roy some moccasins he'd of got 'em."
caroline,"No talk about Roy, okay? And ditto the moccasins. We, can't, afford, them. TOBY Yeah, but you did promise... CAROLINE Sue me. Take me to court. Oh, Toby, I know you're disappointed, but... TOBY Jack.   Call me Jack. "
3.,"2   CONTINUED:    ... Jeanette. Jeanette Marie. TOBY Oh, you're so stupid sometimes, I... The BAWLING of an AIRHORN interrupts him. Both of them look through the back window and see a huge tractor- trailer truck, out of control, bearing down on them. Caroline brakes and steers a hard right, SKIDDING the NASH safely onto the side of the road. The truck, its HORN BLASTING steadily, shimmies and slides past them, and then, hideously, fails to make the next curve: it smashes through the guard rails and into empty space, its HORN still BLARING. Caroline and Toby look at each other, then scramble out of the car."
caroline,"Well, it was everywhere in Moab, they say -- just like gold in the gold-rush days. TOBY But we were too late in Moab, and that guy at the office said nobody'd found any uranium in Salt Lake City. CAROLINE Well, that means we'll have the place pretty much to ourselves, huh? Honey, this could be a big break for us. If this works out, oh, just think: we'll get us a house, get rid of this damn Nash Ambassador -- no money worries... It'll be like heaven on a June day."
5.,"6   INT. CAR - DAWN                                           6 We hear ""MOOD INDIGO"" on the car RADIO and see that a weary Caroline has driven through the night and Toby is slumped against the passenger door. Toby stirs, then opens his eyes. CAROLINE Ask me how far we are from Salt Lake City. Toby is instantly awake, excited. Caroline points to a small highway sign and both she and Toby yell out. CAROLINE/TOBY Forty-seven miles to go!"
toby,It almost makes me want to see Roy -- he was the only one could make the thing stop overheating.  Let's go get rich in Salt Lake City!
6.,"8    EXT. SALT LAKE CITY  - DAY                       8 Toby waits beside the Nash Ambassador, looking toward a three-story concrete building. He holds a portable RADIO, which PLAYS DEAN MARTIN singing ""Volare."""
10.,"15    CONTINUED:                                              15 TOBY Yeah, well if you'd stayed married to Dad none of this would've ever happened. CAROLINE Look, don't you put that    on my back: I can't make your     father call you. I can't make     your brother write you. They     dumped you. Yes. But it's not      my fault."
11.,"16A   CONTINUED:                                            16A TOBY I'm sorry. CAROLINE I know you are, honey. Ah, well -- it wasn't fire, and nobody bled, so I guess we're okay. The TELEPHONE RINGS and she answers it.   When she hears the VOICE on the other end she once again  touches her right cheekbone with a finger -- the spot  where the bruise had been. She sags back against a   wall. CAROLINE Yes...  All right, yes... in an hour, then. Caroline hangs up. TOBY Who was that? She closes her eyes. TOBY Who was that? Caroline laughs aloud, then slides down the wall until she's on the floor still laughing. CAROLINE We've got a guest for dinner: it's Roy. He tracked us down. Toby groans and falls full-length onto the sofa."
12.,"17   CONTINUED:                                               17 ROY ... I found me a room, but it's clear the hell and gone 'cross town. And I think I got a job lined up doin' tune-ups in a Texaco station. How you like it at Winstead's? CAROLINE How do you know where I work? ROY I been here almost a week. CAROLINE You followed me around?    For a week? Watching? Roy doesn't answer.   He just wiggles his eyebrows like Groucho Marx. CAROLINE And how did you ever find me? Again, Roy does the Groucho Marx.    He turns to Toby. ROY You like the rifle, Toby?    'Jack,' I mean. TOBY It's the best present I ever got. I just love it.  I'm going to pretend I'm shooting."
caroline,"Don't point that thing at anybody or I won't teach you to shoot. TOBY It's not loaded! CAROLINE You heard me:    anybody or any thing. TOBY It's got no bullets, for God's sake. CAROLINE Don't make me speak to you again. "
13.,"17   CONTINUED:                                                17 TOBY I'll point it at the sky, then. Caroline sighs. Toby opens a screenless window and points the gun up into the night sky, pretending to fire it over and over. Caroline starts to clear the table. Roy jumps up to help her."
caroline,"Don't.   Toby's still up. Roy leans back, smiling, and eyes Caroline. ROY You are one sweet thing, baby: just the sight of you makes my dick hard. He pulls her to him, starting to kiss her. She fends him off, looking worriedly toward the room where Toby's light burns. ROY Aw, he won't hear anything. Again he pulls her toward him; again she turns her head from the kiss."
14.,"19   INT. KITCHEN - PARALLEL TIME                                  19 Dressed for bed, Toby stands by an open window. He can hear every WORD of ROY'S, who continues to apologize between kisses. The room is illuminated by a nearby streetlamp. The frosty air from the open window causes his breath to steam. He raises two fingers to his lips, pretends to take a drag on a cigarette and blows out the steam from his breath. The VOICES in the other room grow a bit LOUDER, almost to an argument, and then SUBSIDE again. Toby takes another drag from his pretend cig- arette. He looks very young."
15.,"20   CONTINUED:                                              20 WOMAN #2 That sounds like fun. TOBY It is. I've got a palomino horse and a collie, and Dad lets us go on hunts all by ourselves. He gave me this Winchester .22, and last year I shot a mountain lion with it. And Lad -- that's my dog -- found a nest of rattlesnakes one time, and killed all twelve of them... The two Women exchange a glance.     It's obvious the boy is lying."
16.,"21   CONTINUED:                                              21 CAROLINE Not if I can help it. I looked out the window at work today, and he was parked across the street, watching. TOBY Roy's so uncool. So boring. CAROLINE You liked him well enough last night.  'Oh, Roy, I just love my rifle so much! It's the bestest present ever!' TOBY Oh, shut up. But he's smiling, completely unbothered. Suddenly Caroline laughs, stands up, and begins to close the suitcases. Toby laughs, too. TOBY Now? We're going now?     What about all the food? CAROLINE Leave it. TOBY Even the canned stuff? CAROLINE Leave it! They grab the four heavy suitcases and head out the door. Both of them are laughing."
17.,"22   CONTINUED:                                              22 Toby and Caroline groan, then Caroline brightens. CAROLINE What about Seattle? TICKET SELLER  Leaves in nine minutes. They look at each other."
18.,"24    CONTINUED:                                          24 CAROLINE  Yeah, yeah... Toby exits the house. But, Jesus, what a new Toby: he's turned cool. A few months have passed.  He now wears T-shirts and jeans which ride way low on his hips. As he walks along, he combs his hair into a duck's ass in back, and forward into a curl at the center of his forehead. He's 1957 hip -- or thinks he is.  He strolls on, feeling cool."
19.,"26   INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON                                  26 As the three boys troop through the room, they pass Terry Silver's two SISTERS, who are sprawled sensually on a sofa. SISTER #1 Oh look -- it's Elvis, Elvis, and Elvis. TERRY TAYLOR Excuse me, but does your face hurt? 'Cause it's killing me. With that piece of high wit, they're out of the room."
20.,"27    CONTINUED:                                             27 Making wet kissing noises, or just rocking their heads back and forth as if tempted beyond endurance. Then, slowly, they shut up and lie back down."
21.,28   CONTINUED:                                               28 TOBY Don't want who? KATHY 
22.,"28   CONTINUED:    I always say people can call me anything they want, long as they don't call me late for supper! Kathy and Marian think it's pretty funny.     They laugh. Caroline smiles. Toby just stares. DWIGHT So, Jack, you like school? TOBY No."
marian,"He might like it if he ever went there and tried it. TOBY Oh, have another cookie, Marian -- keep your strength up. MARIAN I'd like to just yank that nasty tongue of yours out by the roots. CAROLINE "
23.,28   CONTINUED:   
24.,"28   CONTINUED:    and they exit. As Dwight leaves he kisses his hand, then throws the kiss toward Marian and Kathy. The instant the front door slams: TOBY                MARIAN                      KATHY What a geek.      I love a man knows      He's so appealing. how to dress."
25.,30   CONTINUED:                                                 30 TOBY  Stop what? CAROLINE Sometimes I could kill you as free as I could eat a bite.
toby," Ditto. A car stops and through a window, we see Dwight. Caroline turns to Toby. CAROLINE Please be nice. Toby stops the buck-toothed thing and speaks normally. TOBY All right."
26.,"31    CONTINUED:                                                   31 DWIGHT  Hunting, too: there's game everywhere you look. I don't think I flatter myself by saying that I'm something of a whiz with a rifle, and Concrete gives me every opportunity to prove it..."
26a.,"A33   CONTINUED:                                                  A33 DWIGHT So here we go. Welcome to Concrete. Dwight's home sweet home. Finest people in the whole state of Washington, you ask me. Lots of churches, too. A neighbor of mine says, ""Looking for nice churches, come to Concrete. Looking for sin, go to hell."" I think that's funny... Caroline and Toby are severely underimpressed with their first impression of Concrete."
27.,"33   CONTINUED:                                              33 DWIGHT  Jack Wolff. These are my kids: Skipper, Norma and my baby, Pearl. Everybody says hello, shakes hands, then they all head into the house."
28.,35   CONTINUED:                                            35 DWIGHT  How about you guys? You like it here? They glance at each other.
norma,"It's a little isolated, is all. DWIGHT Not that isolated. NORMA Well, maybe not that isolated. Pretty isolated, though. DWIGHT Aw, there's plenty to do in Concrete if you kids would take a little initiative. When I was growing up we didn't have T.V. -- we used our imaginations. We read the classics. We played musical instruments. You show me a bored kid, I'll show you a lazy kid. CAROLINE I didn't know you played an instrument, Dwight. What do you play? DWIGHT "
29.,35   CONTINUED:                                                 35 SKIPPER There isn't one. We go to Chinook. NORMA Chinook High. DWIGHT It's a few miles downriver. SKIPPER Forty miles. DWIGHT Come off it -- it's not that far.
skipper,"Yeah, I clocked it: thirty-nine miles. In spite of the fact that he's eager for this day to go well, Dwight's bottom teeth begin to show. DWIGHT Ah, you'd bellyache if the goddam school was in your fugging back yard. Just shut your god- damn pie-hole. They all shut their pie-holes. The six walk in a tense, uncomfortable silence for five full beats. Then Pearl tries to help out: PEARL I'm in fifth grade."
30.,"36   CONTINUED:                                              36 DWIGHT 'Turkey shoot' is just a figure of speech. TOBY There's no real turkey? DWIGHT No, it's just regulation paper targets. It's a test of skill.  And, Jack, I just found out yesterday that they won't let kids shoot."
toby,"But you said I could! DWIGHT I know, but they got it all screwed up somehow and told me wrong at first. Toby starts to argue, but Caroline touches his arm. CAROLINE Dwight, you did tell him. DWIGHT  I don't make the rules, Caroline. If I made the rules, I might make different ones, but I don't make the rules."
31.,"37   CONTINUED:                                             37 CAROLINE Well, that sign says this is an N.R.A. club, and I'm a dues-paying N.R.A. member. That gives me the right to participate in the activities of other chapters. MAN You'll be the only woman shooting. Caroline just smiles. The Man shrugs, takes her money and writes down her name."
32.,"38   CONTINUED:                                                    38 On the scoreboard, we see that Caroline is in second place and by only two shots. As the next-to-last round finishes, Caroline is surrounded by a few people who are complimenting her shooting. Dwight's smile is even bigger: Oh, he wanted to be the one to win. The last round starts. A MAN, evidently the one in first place, heads to the shooting alley for his turn. As he passes Caroline, trying to rattle her, he speaks confidently. MAN That second-place trophy ain't bad, honey."
33.,38   CONTINUED:                                                 38 CAROLINE I'm a little behind in my dues -- Thirty-six years behind.
34.,41    CONTINUED:                                          41 Toby and Caroline glance at each other and smile.
35.,"42   INT. BOYS' BATHROOM AT SCHOOL - DAY                           42 Toby, Terry Silver and Terry Taylor lounge against the wall, smoking. TOBY I mean I blew it off, man -- I blew his fuckin' turkey's head off. Terry Silver takes a long slow drag on his cigarette. The other boys glance at each other: they don't buy it. TERRY TAYLOR With a .22. TOBY Fuckin' A.    Winchester .22.   Pump. TERRY TAYLOR Wolff, you are so full of shit. TOBY Don't believe me -- see if I care. TERRY TAYLOR All a .22 bullet would do is make a hole in his head. Toby takes a drag on his cigarette. TOBY One bullet, maybe. TERRY TAYLOR Oh. Oh, I see -- you hit the turkey more than once. While he was flying. In the head."
36.,"43   CONTINUED:                                             43 The car rolls silently down the hill. It CRASHES into another car at the bottom, making a LOUD NOISE. The three boys run like the wind out of sight."
37.,45   CONTINUED:                                                  45 MR. SHIPPY He wrote obscene words on the wall. CAROLINE  He wrote obscene words on the wall.
caroline,What obscene words? MR. SHIPPY 
38.,"45    CONTINUED:    ... a Nash Ambassador. Caroline gives a bark of laughter. She brings out a handkerchief and coughs, as if she has a cold. Mr. Shippy looks puzzled."
toby,"What do you mean? CAROLINE Ever since Duke and I got divorced, you're a different boy. I know he never calls you and I could kill him for it -- but that's how Duke is. And Gregory's in Princeton now, so I guess... "
39.,"46A   CONTINUED:                                                    46A TOBY No I don'... CAROLINE Yes, you do. You steal from Marian's purse -- I just can't handle you anymore, and it scares me. I don't know what to do. So, you tell me what to do. TOBY "
40.,"46A   CONTINUED:                                                46A The two stare at each other. CAROLINE I can't think of anything else to do. But first I want your approval. Again the two stare at each other. TOBY All right. Caroline nods, turns away."
41.,"49   INT. BUICK - NIGHT                                              49 Dwight    takes a pull from a pint bottle of whiskey and gives    Toby a sneering, contemptuous look. Toby reaches over,    SNAPS ON the RADIO. Immediately Dwight SNAPS IT off.     Then, in the headlight's glare, Toby sees a dark shape. TOBY Hey, look:   is that a raccoon or a beaver. Dwight swerves deliberately to hit the animal. There is a sickening THUMP, and Dwight stops. As he backs up: DWIGHT Go get it -- the pelt's worth fifty bucks, minimum. TOBY That thing's probably got rabies... DWIGHT  Get it!"
42.,"51   CONTINUED:                                                    51 DWIGHT That's what I hear. I hear you're a real hotshot. Come and go where you please, do what you please. Isn't that right? Yeah, regular man about town. Performer, too. That right, Jack? You a performer? TOBY No, sir. DWIGHT That's a goddamned lie. Dwight keeps glancing from the road to Toby, and back again. DWIGHT If there's one thing I can't stomach, it's a liar. TOBY I'm not a liar. DWIGHT Sure you are. You or Marian. Is Marian a liar? She says you're quite the little performer. Is that a lie? You tell me that's a lie and we'll drive back to Seattle so you can call her a liar to her face. You want me to do that? TOBY No."
dwight,"Then you must be the one's a liar, right? "
43.,51   CONTINUED:    You're in for a whole 'nother ballgame.
44.,"52   CONTINUED:                                                     52 DWIGHT I know you think you're better than me. Caroline told me all about your rich daddy and your prep-school brother, but your fancy days are over: you're a Concrete boy now. I'm gonna give you a big injection of Concrete. That's right -- inoculate you. Oh, my, yes. You're gonna find out that in Concrete we have to be able to do more than sing Fats Domino songs, we work... Skipper and Pearl bring the tub with four blue stars painted on its side, Dwight plops the skinned beaver into the water. The hairless carcass stands in the tub, its chin on the edge. Pearl shudders and turns away."
45.,"53   CONTINUED:                                                   53 DWIGHT So here's what I think: I think idle hands are the devil's workshop, and so I found our Jack a little something to do.  I picked up two barrels of horse- chestnuts in the park. You can spend your evenings hulling 'em. And I enrolled you in the Boy Scouts, and you've got a paper route, starting Monday, every afternoon from three to six-thirty -- pays fifty-five bucks a month. What d'you say?"
46.,"54   CONTINUED:                                                        54 MISS GRAHAM Well, closer, maybe. But no. There is a pause.     Finally, Toby raises his hand. MISS GRAHAM Jack? TOBY It's angry, sort of bitter. MISS GRAHAM Very good, Jack. Bull's-eye. From the front of    the room, a tall,   thin, effeminate boy, ARTHUR GAYLE,    turns to look at   Toby and holds the gaze for three    full beats, then   turns around and faces the front.     What the hell does   it mean?"
47.,"55   CONTINUED:                                                    55 DWIGHT  And your rich Daddy Warbucks and your Princeton brother don't give a shit about you, 'cause Caroline told me they haven't even written in over two years. So it looks like I'm all you got now -- it's just you and me. Feels sort of inevitable, doesn't it, hotshot? It's like we were fated for each other, like I'm the one guy on Earth could set you straight. And don't you ever think I won't enjoy doing it, 'cause..."
48.,55   CONTINUED:   
49.,"55   CONTINUED:    Skipper is asleep in his bed. Across the 55 room, Toby lies with his portable RADIO against his head. We hear, very, very softly, ROSEMARY CLOONEY crooning ""Hey, There."" He's tired. He's lonely. He's miserable. DISSOLVE TO:"
pearl,"That's no fair. You make me sick. I don't know why you have to live here, anyway. Daddy says we should think of it like you were a charity kid. Toby takes out his comb, combs his hair a bit, then holds it out to Pearl, an exaggerated look of innocence on his face. TOBY Wanna comb your hair, Pearl? Pearl covers her bald spot with one hand. TOBY Probably you do, since you've got such pretty hair.  I know if I had hair as pretty as yours, Pearl, I'd comb it all the time."
50.,"57   INT. DWIGHT'S KITCHEN - LATER                                 57 Dwight, Toby, Skipper, Norma, and Pearl are enjoying the snowcream. DWIGHT ... heard there was a fresh snow this morning, so I drove up to the mountains. I stopped in a field where it was all clean. I was finished packing it up high when somebody said...  You're ugly as a madman's ass. PEARL No, you are."
skipper,"What'd you say to the ugly woman? DWIGHT I didn't say nothin' -- I ran. Everybody laughs again.    They eat in silence for a beat. DWIGHT I'm gonna get you a Scout uniform, Jack. TOBY "
51.,"57   CONTINUED:                                               57 PEARL Can I join the Girl Scouts? DWIGHT I'm getting one for me, too. Don't believe in doing anything halfway. If you're serious about the Scouts...  ... then I want you to do it right. We'll do it right together. Dwight takes out a magazine entitled Boy's Life.    He hands it to Toby."
dwight,"I got you a subscription to this. I'll take the price out of your paper route money. TOBY Boy's Life? DWIGHT It's the official Scout magazine. Tells about what it means to be a Scout, what kind of boy you need to be, and, oh, about merit badges and stuff like that. Toby opens the book at random, reads from it. TOBY 'Suggested good turns a Scout can do: assist a foreign  boy with some English grammar.  Help put out a burning field.  Give water to a crippled dog.'  I could do those. DWIGHT Hell, yes, you could. You're a bright kid. I want this Scout thing done right, okay? Toby nods, enthusiastic, happy."
52.,"58   CONTINUED:                                             58 The shirt-sleeves have been shortened but the shoulders extend two inches beyond the ends of his shoulders. The pants legs have been cut off and hemmed but the crotch of the trousers hangs down three inches too low, giving him a stumpy, dwarfish look. Toby yells to someone O.S. TOBY I'm not going. DWIGHT  You're gonna shit and fall back in it -- that's all you're gonna do. Now get out here."
toby,"I look like an idiot. DWIGHT You act like an idiot, you look fine. TOBY You said you'd get me a new uniform. DWIGHT I said I'd try to get you a new uniform. Beside, this one is new -- new to you. "
53.,"59   CONTINUED:                                           59 TOBY But look at the sleeves and how it hangs down between my legs! DWIGHT Oh piss and moan -- all you can do is piss and moan. TOBY Yeah, piss and moan -- I notice you're all jazzed up in new stuff. DWIGHT They didn't have second-hand uniforms in my size."
toby,"Oh, yeah, pull the other leg, it's got bells on it! Toby throws himself down on the sofa. DWIGHT And what're you gonna tell Caroline this weekend? You gonna say you wouldn't join the Scouts because... him didn't wike his widdle uniform? Dwight picks up the copy of Boy's Life and thumbs through it, He reads: DWIGHT 'No boy given over to dissipation or negativity can stand the gaff. He quickly tires and gives up. He is the type who usually lacks courage at the crucial moment. He cannot take punishment and come back smiling.' Dwight looks at Toby expectantly.   Toby hesitates, then gives up. TOBY All right, but this stinks. Toby walks outside.   Dwight follows. DWIGHT Hotshot, you don't know it yet, but me and Concrete are in your blood. We're going to make a man of you yet -- and in years to come you'll thank me. You'll remember me. Me and Concrete."
54.,"60   EXT. CAROLINE'S HOUSE - DAY                                   60 Dwight's Buick pulls up and Caroline bursts out the front door. She runs to the car and hugs Toby. CAROLINE Oh, I missed you! TOBY Me, too. CAROLINE You look good.     How are you? TOBY I'm okay.    I'm fine."
55.,"61   CONTINUED:                                              61 DWIGHT  ... and we had snowcream one night, and, oh, just lots of stuff. Caroline glances at Toby, then at Dwight, then back again."
56.,"62   CONTINUED:                                               62 TOBY I'm fine. CAROLINE You swear?   You act odd. TOBY No, I'm fine. CAROLINE Well, good. I'd feel awful if it hadn't worked out. A pause."
caroline,"I told Dwight I'd marry him. In two weeks. I don't know what else to do. I mean, he's been helping me with the rent since Kathy left. And you need a father. I think it's the best thing all the way around -- what d'you think? There is a pause as they look at each other. TOBY I think it's the best thing. CAROLINE I think it's the best thing, too. Caroline smiles, smooths his hair, then goes into the house. Toby continues to walk. Suddenly, he spins around and tears out toward the house. By God, he'll tell her just what's been going on. He bangs through the front door and up the stairs."
57.,64    CONTINUED:                                            64 TOBY Hungry. He makes another sign. TOBY Food. He makes another sign. TOBY Want. He makes another sign.
toby,Great mystery. He makes another sign. TOBY Father. He stares silently at himself in the mirror.
58.,A65   CONTINUED:                                               A65 TOBY It's so white. DWIGHT I got a good deal on this paint.  It'll darken up when it dries.
59.,"65   CONTINUED:      INT. LIVING ROOM - NEXT MORNING                        65 Everywhere we look is white, the walls, ceiling, furniture -- all of it. Only the old Baldwin upright piano has escaped painting. Dwight eyes it suspiciously. DWIGHT Sort of stands out, doesn't it?"
toby,"Yeah, you could say that. 65   G)   SAME SCENE - LATER                                     65 They paint the Baldwin white. Dwight hesitates, then starts to paint the foot pedals. 65   H)   SAME SCENE - LATER                                     65 Dwight's face tells us that something still doesn't suit him. He glances at Toby, Toby nods, and they converge on the piano. 65   J)   SAME SCENE - LATER                                     65 Very carefully, Dwight and Toby finish painting the dark ivory keys to match the rest of the room. ELVIS SCREAMS OUT the last line, ""You can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes!"""
60.,"67   CONTINUED:                                                67 CAROLINE Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry... don't know what's the matter with me... you're right... it does look clean... But she can't stop laughing.    Her laughter has just a tinge of hysteria."
61.,"69   CONTINUED:                                             69 Dwight continues to stroke Caroline, his hands everywhere, but now she is unresponsive. CAROLINE You mean you don't like to make love face to face? DWIGHT  No, I don't like it. I can't handle it -- I don't like to see the face. CAROLINE You mean ever?"
jimmy,What a homo. TOBY He sure walks like a girl. JIMMY And runs like one and talks like one and throws like one. Probably takes a pee like one too -- just squats right down. TOBY He smarted off to me the other day -- told me I was a bourgeois. JIMMY What the frig's a bourgeois? 
63.,71   CONTINUED:                                          71 OSCAR 
64.,"71   CONTINUED:                                                71 Without warning, Arthur swings a fist at Toby, catching him on the ear. Arthur's second blow hits him in the back of the head. The fight is on. Arthur throws   punches sidearm, with lots of wrist action, but there are   so many of them. Before Toby can react, Arthur has hit   him four times, including one wild haymaker that puts Toby   on his knees. While Toby's still on his knees, Arthur tries to kick him in the stomach. The kick is deadened by the papers in Toby's bag, Arthur bends over Toby, screaming as if he has lost his mind:"
arthur,"GET UP! GET UP, YOU SON OF A BITCHING MAGGOT GAGGER! I'LL STOMP YOUR GUTS OUT! I'LL KILL YOU! Toby gets up, and again Arthur sails in with those wild roundhouse swings. Then Toby gets in a solid punch to Arthur's face that rocks the bigger boy back on his heels. Arthur grabs his head and roars like a wounded buffalo. Almost immediately Arthur's eye puffs and begins to swell shut. Snot streaming from both nostrils, still roaring, Arthur flies at Toby again. Toby closes with him, to hold those flailing arms still, and the two stagger around the street like drunken dancers. They separate, exchange a few blows, then grapple with each other again. Then Arthur hooks Toby's leg, trips him, and the two roll off the shoulder of the road and down an embankment. They hit the muddy bottom of the gully still hitting, flailing, kicking -- first Toby is on top, then Arthur, then Toby, then Arthur. By now they are panting, each breath is a heave, a gasp. Then, suddenly, Arthur gives out completely -- he falls on top of Toby, pressing him deeper into the mud. With his last bit of strength Toby throws the bigger boy off him and sits up, while PEPPER BARKS FURIOUSLY at him and threatens to nip his leg. Toby staggers to his feet and starts to climb the gully. He looks relieved -- at least it's over. No, it's not. From behind him he hears three words. ARTHUR Take it back. "
65.,"71   CONTINUED:                                                   71 Toby turns   to see a bloody-faced, swollen-eyed Arthur clambering   up the hill after him, like some monster that won't   die. Both boys reach the top and stand facing one   another. ARTHUR Take it back. Arthur's words are not angry anymore.    Toby's worn out too... TOBY Okay. ARTHUR Say it. TOBY Okay.   I take it back. ARTHUR No, say 'You're not a sissy.' Toby glances at Oscar and Jimmy. Their faces are gleeful but he doesn't care what the hell they think. TOBY You're not a sissy. Arthur immediately turns and walks away, but Toby ignores them and walks away in the opposite direction, delivering his hated newspapers."
66.,72   CONTINUED:                                             72 CAROLINE  ... seems like this place is so ugly. Seems like everywhere I look there's something... ugly.
67.,"73   CONTINUED:                                              73 Dwight sits down next to Toby, eager for details. DWIGHT How'd it start? TOBY I called him a sissy. Dwight hoots with laughter and slaps his leg. DWIGHT Well, he sure's hell can't sue you for slander. That boy fights for the pink team. Did you make him cry?"
toby,"Well... he was just ready to. I called him a big-assed, squat- to-pee sissy.  He dry-gulched you. Now that's your fault. You gotta keep your guard up. There's no excuse for getting dry-gulched. I'll show you a couple moves after supper that'll leave Miss Arthur Gayle wondering what month it is."
68.,"74   CONTINUED:                                             74 DWIGHT  So it was real hot out, okay? And there were these horse turds laying all over the place. I picked one up and went up to him, but not acting tough, okay? Acting more like, 'Oh gee, I'm so scared, please don't hurt me.' Sort of like this: Dwight slumps his shoulders, drops his chin, and looks up through his eyebrows, a simpering expression on his face. DWIGHT So I say, 'Excuse me, but what's the problem?' And he starts in on me again, blah, blah, blah, and I jam a horse turd right into that big mouth. Then I give him a sucker punch in the breadbasket, and he goes down like a... Dwight goes on, relishing the story."
69.,"76   CONTINUED:                                              76 CAROLINE ... not good, to tell you the truth not good at all.  The thing is, he's out on the porch teaching Jack to box right now. I keep thinking if I can hang on, things'll settle down. If I can just hang on long enough, it'll work out and my kid'll have a father. You know?"
toby,"You said you'd show me how to dry-gulch somebody. DWIGHT Okay. Now you can always  kick somebody in the balls, but I like this one better: What you  do is hit 'em in the throat with the side of your forearm. You  wait 'til -- hah! Without warning, Dwight lunges at Toby and swings the side of his arm toward Toby's throat. Toby dodges wildly, falling backward over a box of sports equipment. "
70.,"77   CONTINUED:                                              77 DWIGHT Now that's dry-gulching. Hit 'em in the throat, but do it before they're expecting it. Now you try. TOBY I'm afraid I'll hurt you. DWIGHT You won't. TOBY But I might. Finally Toby gives a half-hearted ""Hah!"" and swings the side of his forearm toward Dwight's throat. Dwight catches the arm easily. DWIGHT Come onnn.   You're not trying. Again Toby hesitates, again he says ""Hah!"" and gives a lukewarm swing at Dwight's throat. DWIGHT Well, don't go all shy and delicate on me -- you're as sissy as little Miss Arthur Gayle. Yeah -- I'll just call you 'Little Miss Jackie Wolff.' Ooh, my, yes -- Hello, Jackie. Toby's eyes flare up, then he lowers his head, biting his lip, sniffling a bit. DWIGHT Aw, Jesus Christ, if you're gonna --"
71.,"78    CONTINUED:                                          78 CAROLINE I know you may think this is silly, Dwight, but it seems like... I don't know, like an emblem or something. I want to be able to see your face when we make love. How else can we be cl -- The rest of the word is jerked out of her as Dwight turns her onto her side, away from him, and proceeds to make love again in his favorite manner. DWIGHT You just don't know what's good, Sugar. You're too tense. You just relax and Dwight'll take you on a little trip. Okay? You'll have a good time. Caroline closes her eyes."
72.,"79   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - MUCH LATER           79 Smoking a cigarette and wearing a nightgown, Caroline walks to the front door. She opens the front door and stands looking out. Then she puts her finger on the door and slowly pushes it shut with one finger. She does this once more. Then she does it again. She turns, walks toward Toby's room."
73.,"82   CONTINUED:                                              82 CAROLINE You remind me of a baby bird -- you know those frantic little things with their mouths wide open, wanting, wanting. TOBY Well, at least ask him about my gym shoes again. I can practice barefoot but for games I gotta have shoes. CAROLINE I'm not a referee. I won't do it."
toby,"Oh, we know, we know: the bride won't argue. The bride won't raise her voice. CAROLINE Well, I'll tell you what    the bride will do: the bride will     get up and walk over there and    slap hell out of the bride's son.     Now does the bride's son want his    face slapped? TOBY Oh, I hate it here! I wish we could just get up and go. CAROLINE I don't have another 'get up and go' left in me! You understand? I'm telling you I've hit a god- damn wall. I can't run anymore. Now this whole thing isn't perfect for me, either... let me impress that on you real strong, okay? I don't wake up singing every morning. But I'm going to make this marriage work -- I won't join in any fights, you got that? I won't even raise my voice! Caroline points to the sink. CAROLINE See those two roses? He picked them for me on his way home last night. "
74.,82   CONTINUED:    Seriously: you have to concentrate on the good stuff. Caroline turns her attention back to the curtains.
75.,"83   CONTINUED:                                              83 Faster and faster -- Caroline's heel catches an end table and sends it spinning and faster they go. Caroline's head is thrown back; she's laughing with pleasure. As the MUSIC reaches its CLIMAX, Dwight spins Caroline back to the sofa, lets her go, and WHAM! she lands back where she was seated exactly on the last note of the song. Amid the general laughter and applause, Caroline smiles at Toby. CAROLINE  Try to find the good stuff, honey."
76.,"84   CONTINUED:                                             84 TOBY So what? DWIGHT So that makes you a hog. I just wanted to establish that fact, and now I have. Caroline and Skipper enter, carrying throw pillows and materials. DWIGHT  Oh, Dad! Skipper leaves the room. Caroline sits down, begins to try various materials as coverings for the pillows."
77.,84   CONTINUED:   
78.,"84   CONTINUED:                                                     84 DWIGHT I, well, no, it's not that -- I just want you to be well-behaved. Your rich daddy 'Duke' doesn't care anything about you, and so somebody's got to train you, and one of the things you've gotta be trained about is not to be a hog and eat everybody's candy like a -- Dwight stops short as Caroline says one word. CAROLINE Oh."
79.,"85    INT. SCOUT MEETING - NIGHT                                  85 Father and son photographs are being taken. Dwight is the only father who wears a complete uniform and cap. When Dwight and Toby's turn comes, Dwight puts on a big smile and throws an arm around Toby's shoulder. DWIGHT Check for the tongue tonight -- you forgot it last week. Otherwise you won't get your life-saving badge."
80.,"86   CONTINUED:                                              86 ARTHUR Smart, too -- he can talk. TOBY  Sure -- I just about believe you. ARTHUR Hey, Pepper -- what's on a tree? As PEPPER BARKS TWICE: ARTHUR Bark! Way to go, Pepper -- pretty smart. Oh, I was wondering, Pepper -- I wanted to ask you something: how's the world treating you? As PEPPER BARKS ONCE: ARTHUR Rough!   Yeah, I know what you mean. TOBY That's dumb. A little funny, though. How come your dad never comes to meetings with you? ARTHUR I don't have a dad. Never did. I sprang full-blown from my mother's forehead. You want to walk home with me and Pepper?"
toby,"Sure -- compared to a ride home with Dwight, it'll be like heaven on a June day."
81.,87   CONTINUED:                                              87 ARTHUR  Every day of my life feels like a mile on the Bataan Death March.
82.,"87   CONTINUED:    Maybe, maybe, but no matter how many times I have to repeat: my primary goal's to get out of Concrete. TOBY Burma-Shave! Arthur and Toby laugh.   As they walk on, though, Toby's face is thoughtful."
83.,"91   CONTINUED:                                              91 DWIGHT Yours. TOBY Mine? DWIGHT You said you wanted a dog. TOBY A collie, though. Not this one. DWIGHT Well, he's yours. You paid for him. Go get ready for Norma's play."
toby,"What d'you mean I paid for him? But Dwight doesn't answer.   Toby waits, then shrugs and leaves the room."
84.,"93   CONTINUED:                                                  93 DWIGHT Well, want in one hand and shit in the other -- see which gets full first. TOBY But, Dwight, that Winchester was mine. DWIGHT And Champ's   your dog.     Jesus, I trade some   old piece of    crap for a valuable   hunting dog,    and all you can do   is piss and    moan."
toby,I'm not pissing and moaning. DWIGHT The hell you aren't. You can just make your own deals from now on.
85.,95   CONTINUED:                                              95 CAROLINE  Get his rifle back. DWIGHT But that dog's a champion! Caroline calmly SMASHES another PLATE on the countertop. CAROLINE Get his rifle back. DWIGHT Am I supposed to go clear to Seattle just to get...
86.,"96   CONTINUED:                                              96 CAROLINE 'Course, having seen that dog, I wouldn't suggest you hang by your thumbs 'til those papers come. I mean, that dog is ugly. Toby gives her a dirty look, but Caroline's smile makes Toby grin. CAROLINE That's nice -- I haven't seen a real smile out of you in a month. TOBY Oh, Mom, can't we leave here? I hate it so much. You don't like it either -- all you do is stick your head in a sewing machine night and day. Let's just leave and start over someplace else. CAROLINE 'Start over.' Do you know how many times I've started over, sweetheart? I don't want to do it anymore. This is as far as I want to go. This place. I have to make this work somehow. We do. You're fourteen now -- you have to help me. TOBY But if... CAROLINE But me no buts, honey. I told you: I've hit a wall. And besides, it's not so bad here, if you just try to -- TOBY If you say 'look for the good stuff,' I'm gonna get Dwight's 30/30 and shoot myself! CAROLINE Seriously, though: give the place a chance. Give him a chance. TOBY Great. Just great. What a life: I gotta live with Dwight... I got a sissy for a new best friend... "
87.,"96   CONTINUED:    I got no rifle... I got no gym shoes... CAROLINE Well, look on the bright side... You got a dog. In spite of his disappointment over the rifle, in spite of all that Caroline had said about staying with Dwight, Toby is happy to see Caroline completely back to her old self again, joking with him. He grins and, with the palm of his hand, he gives her shoulder a gentle shove. She returns the gesture. And the two of them sit on the steps, staring into the twilight."
91.,"107A   CONTINUED:                                                  107A DWIGHT Your mother said you were sick. Feeling better? TOBY Yeah, I am. DWIGHT Good, good.    Get some sleep, did you? TOBY Yeah, I slept about four hours. DWIGHT Must've needed it. A pause: DWIGHT Oh, by the way, you didn't happen to hear a funny pinging noise in the engine, did you? TOBY What engine? DWIGHT I was downtown with Champ a few minutes ago, and I met a guy who recognized him. Said he'd seen my dog this very morning. Told me an interesting story of how he and the dog happened to meet. What d'you think about that?"
toby,"I don't know what you -- Suddenly Dwight is across the floor and onto the bed. He straddles Toby and slaps him across the face with the left hand then the right, again and again. Toby holds a forearm protectively across his face. Dwight holds both Toby's hands with one of his and, slaps the boy's face again and again. Finally Toby manages to get his right hand loose.      He slams his forearm across Dwight's throat. Dwight rears back, choking and gagging. Toby throws off the covers and tries to run. Still choking, Dwight grabs the back of Toby's hair and forces the boy's face down against the mattress. "
92.,"107A   CONTINUED:                                                  107A Then he doubles up his fist and slams it into the back of Toby's neck. Toby goes rigid with pain. Dwight stumbles up gasping for breath. DWIGHT Only me. On this whole earth, to straighten you out. And I will do it kill or cure. Now get your ass up -- you're going to school."
93.,"109   CONTINUED:                                              109 ... The Apartment, and a five foot poster that says, ""ELECT JOHN KENNEDY, 1960."" In the back seat, Psycho pours vodka into a half empty can of Hawaiian punch, then takes a huge swig. PSYCHO  Oh, look -- there goes Carol Baumgarten. Ain't she sweet? She's hot for Wolff. TOBY I wish. CHUCK Won't do her any good, though -- Jack's saving himself for Rhea Clark. TOBY Knock it off. JERRY You know what he said about Rhea? Said even the inside of her arm turned him on. You slay me, Wolff. She is pretty though."
94.,"109   CONTINUED:                                                 109 There is a pause while all the boys dwell on this thought. It sounds good to them. PSYCHO Aghhh, pussy!"
95.,"112   CONTINUED:                                              112 DWIGHT  Here I am, you lucky people! Toby and Caroline exchange a glance.     It speaks volumes. 113   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                          113 Dwight, Caroline, Toby and Pearl sit at the table, eat- ing. Champ sits by Dwight's chair -- obviously his dog. Dwight seems unchanged by the two years. Just now, Dwight is in the middle of telling another of his ""Dwight Is The Best"" stories. From the bored faces around the table, this is another in a long series."
dwight,"... So the S.O.B. had been on my back for a week at work, okay? Sayin' I stole his wrench, an' poured oil all over his tools, as if! Anyway, he went just one step too far with old Dwight, okay? Spat on the floor as I walked by. I turned around and walked back to him, acting so dainty and humble and scared, you know, all innocent -- and the minute he took his eyes off me, BLAM, I dry gulched him! I shut his water off good! Never gave me another second's grief to this very day. There is a pause.   One more story.   Nobody has much of a reaction."
caroline,"I heard Kennedy on the news again tonight -- I don't know: I hate the Democrats and the Republicans, but then once in a while somebody comes along who doesn't seem like... "
96.,"113   CONTINUED:                                            113 CAROLINE  I'm going to work for his campaign. DWIGHT No. Too many Republicans   in this town. They hear my wife's   working for the Democrats, they'll  take their cars someplace else  to be fixed. Bad idea. No."

No!"" as two men escort him out the door. In the next shot we see a long black car parked on a country road, and we hear a SHOT."
toby,I'll be through in a minute. Dwight looks around. DWIGHT You left the lid off the damn toothpaste again. TOBY 
98.,"115   CONTINUED:                                              115 DWIGHT Come on. Oh, come on.     Give me an excuse. Toby hesitates, then leaves the bathroom, humiliated."
99.,"118   CONTINUED:                                              118 It's a good imitation of Psycho, and Toby laughs. TOBY He hears you do that, you're dead. Hey, lemme copy your math homework. ARTHUR No, but I'll show you how to work the problems. TOBY I tell you I'm thirsty, you offer me a sandwich thank you and fuck you."
arthur,"Oh, Jack. TOBY Oh, Jaaack! ARTHUR I take it back you don't act like Psycho, you act like Dwight. TOBY  I know it. He's winning. I do act like him. I feel like him sometimes. I've gotta get out of this place or I'm a dead one. ARTHUR I know, but you've said that for two years."
toby,I mean it. I may go live with my brother Gregory in Princeton. ARTHUR You mean the brother Gregory in Princeton who never calls you? That brother Gregory? TOBY He wrote me. ARTHUR And he asked you to live with him? 
100.,"118   CONTINUED:                                               118 TOBY No. But I'm going. Or maybe I could go to a prep school like Gregory did. Like my dad did. ARTHUR What about your grades? And what would you use for money? TOBY I don't know. Dwight owes me over twelve hundred bucks! If I hadn't let him keep my paper route money, I'd be okay."
arthur,"If the dog hadn't stopped to pee, he'd have caught the rabbit. Suddenly Toby is angry.   He stands up, moves to another seat. TOBY I think Dwight was right about you I think you fight for the pink team. Toby falls into another seat, then, pulls his head back and bangs it against the window. Then does it again, harder."
101.,"120   CONTINUED:                                                  120 ARCH Nobody in your family ever even been in a Corvette, let alone owned one. CHUCK You wait and see if I don't get one. I'm gonna move down to Seattle, get a job at Bendix and drive a 'Vette to work every day. JERRY My uncle can have any car he wants. He makes big bucks as an electrician."
arch,"Yeah?   How big? JERRY Hundred seventy-five a week, take home. PSYCHO Bullshitter! JERRY Fuck you, it's true. CHUCK Even the supervisors at Bendix don't make that. JERRY So how are you ever gonna make enough to drive a 'Vette then, fuck-face? The others all laugh at Chuck. Toby has reached the group and stands on the lip of the large wooden platform that they are on and listens while leaning on a large hook. PSYCHO I'm gonna drive a T-bird, someday. CHUCK An' I'm gonna own a Corvette if I have to hold up the Bendix payroll to get it. JERRY Fuck you. "
102.,"120   CONTINUED:    Welcome to Concreeee... Toby topples over and falls down a bank of rubble. The other burst out laughing and hooting. The CAMERA MOVES off them and CRANES DOWN to a spread-eagled Toby's face. The LAUGHTER ECHOES around the building. Toby begins to laugh, but it soon turns to bitter tears. DISSOLVE TO:"
103.,122   INT. KENNEDY CAMPAIGN OFFICE - DAY                         122 Toby enters the small office where Caroline is running hundreds of flyers on a duplicating machine. Surprised she sees Toby's expression. CAROLINE What is it? TOBY I called Gregory at Princeton.  He's sending me applications for prep schools. I need you to take me to Seattle to take some entrance exams.
caroline,"Would a prep school take you with, uh, your school record? TOBY I've got to get out of here, Mom. I've got to. I've got to get away. CAROLINE When are the tests? TOBY Saturday. CAROLINE You'll be there. TOBY He won't let you have the Buick."
caroline,You'll be there!
103a.,"124A   SAME SCENE - LATER                                   124A All the boys are taking the test, working hard."
104.,"126   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S KITCHEN - EVENING                126 Dwight sits at the table, a drink in his hand. Caroline hurriedly prepares dinner. She tosses a milk carton into a brimming waste basket, then speaks to Toby, who enters the room. CAROLINE Take that trash out for me, honey. Toby grabs the trash and exits."
105.,"128   CONTINUED:                                             128 DWIGHT Ooooooh, oh, I'm so scared.   Oooh."
106.,"131   CONTINUED:                                                  131 TOBY You could leave too, you know. ARTHUR No, I've grown progressively fond of Concrete. I think I'll stay here all alone and dress up in my mama's old clothes sometimes -- like you said. Arthur turns and    swishes away. Toby pats   the manilla envelope, turns    back to the saw. Suddenly   he jerks, looks down, and    sees that the ring finger  of his left hand is spurting    blood. Toby says a mild,   astonished ""Hey,"" and sinks    to his knees."
109.,"140   CONTINUED:                                             140 PEARL I can't find where this green piece goes -- it's gotta be grass. Dwight sighs with irritation at the interruption of his listening pleasure, and turns UP the VOLUME on the record."
caroline, Don't go off without eating. TOBY I'll get a sandwich after work.
toby,"Hello? All right.     Tomorrow, then. Goodbye. Toby hangs up, turns to Caroline, quietly: TOBY It's Hill School -- the last one I applied to. They haven't accepted me, but they're sending somebody up to interview me. Caroline upsets the puzzle getting up to hug Toby."
110.,"141   INT. DRUGSTORE - AFTERNOON                                  141 Toby is sitting in a booth with MR. HOWARD, a man in his late thirties. Toby has made a real attempt to look good.    His hair is modified, and he wears a tie and a suit. TOBY ... Yeah, I enjoy my classes, especially the ones that are advanced, but I've been feeling a little restless lately. It's hard to explain. MR. HOWARD Well, you're probably bored. Not being challenged. Your application was very good, Toby, but we have many boys who want to go to Hill. Not everybody is comfortable at a prep school. TOBY I think I would be. My father and brother went to prep schools. MR. HOWARD Is that right?     Where? TOBY Deerfield and Choate. Mr. Howard is impressed. MR. HOWARD I see. Well, maybe you'd like it. Hill was difficult for me, though -- classes were hard, and the boys seemed cold -- interested in money and social position. "
111.,"141   CONTINUED:                                              141 He stops    talking as we hear, O.S., ""AG-H-H-H!"" Psycho and Arch have    entered the drugstore. Toby's back is to the door, and    he slouches deeper into the booth, praying that he won't    be seen. Arch and Psycho buy cigarettes. ARCH ... so she said, 'No, I don't want you to do that,' and I said 'Oh, baby, let me get down and grovel on it.' I mean, I ate her pussy 'til my tongue was calloused, and then..."
112.,142   CONTINUED:                                              142 DWIGHT  General Motors makes shit cars.
113.,"144   CONTINUED:                                              144 PEARL He said they're gonna give you two thousand three hundred dollars a year and it costs two thousand five hundred dollars... so you gotta come up with the other two hundred. Great, huh?  I'm making hot dogs -- I'll make one for you. Can you put mustard on some bread for us? Toby gets a jar of mustard from a cupboard, but it's empty, so he tosses it on top of the trash can, gets a new jar and starts to open it."
114.,"144   CONTINUED:                                              144 Dwight retrieves the bottle. There are a few streaks of mustard under the neck of the bottle. He holds it close to Toby's face. DWIGHT Empty?   That look empty to you? PEARL It looks empty to me. TOBY It looks empty to me, too. Dwight pushes the jar against Toby's eye, leaving mustard stains on the boy's face."
dwight,"Look again, hotshot.    Is it empty? Toby jerks his head away, not answering. Dwight slams down the jar of mustard, grabs Toby by the back of the hair and forces his face down against the mustard jar. PEARL Dad! DWIGHT "
115.,"144   CONTINUED:                                              144 DWIGHT Now.     Was it empty? Slowly he stands up and faces Dwight. TOBY Yes! Dwight slaps Toby across the mouth and the battle is on. As Pearl stands frozen, Toby lunges at Dwight, they grapple and stagger around the room. GLASS SHATTERS, the kitchen table CRASHES over, and their feet STAMP and SHUFFLE but Toby is a wild man. Even though he has only one good hand. He lands a blow between Dwight's eyes that bangs the man back against the wall."
116.,144   CONTINUED:   
117.,"144   CONTINUED:                                               144 Caroline takes three full beats and then her face changes. She speaks wonderingly: CAROLINE I don't, do I? TOBY No, you don't. CAROLINE I could leave with you, couldn't I? TOBY Yes, you could!"
dwight,"What about me? CAROLINE I could just walk right out that door, couldn't I? TOBY Yes, you could! Caroline takes a deep breath, a weight has been lifted. CAROLINE My God... the lightness. DWIGHT What about me? CAROLINE I'm leaving, too."
dwight,"No. CAROLINE Oh, Dwight, why do you want me to stay? You don't even like me, not really. DWIGHT You're not leaving! CAROLINE "
118.,"144   CONTINUED:                                               144 Dwight makes a terrible noise of frustration and rage, doubles his fists, and starts toward Caroline. Immediately Toby grabs the baseball bat and holds it out, ready to strike, as the two begin to back toward the door. DWIGHT ... you two've always sided in against me, always thought you were better than me. I tried. I did the best I could. What about me? Am I supposed to just crawl off in a ditch someplace and die? I've always been the nigger. Everybody's nigger. Ever since I was little. Caroline and Toby are at the door, run across the yard and down the street. Dwight stands in the doorway, yelling: DWIGHT What about me? When is it ever Dwight's turn for some consideration? What about me? I'll tell you one thing -- you'll remember me!"
toby,"Man, oh man, oh man. CAROLINE Well, we're out. TOBY Great, isn't it? CAROLINE Yes. It's great. And you got the scholarship! Congratulations, honey. "
119.,"145   CONTINUED:                                             145 TOBY Yeah, I'm out! I'm outta here! Maybe I'll crash and burn, but it's a chance, so I'm gone! I'm history, Histoire. Nobody's gonna tell me what to do now, nobody. I'm free as a bird. Sayonara nest.  Heaven on a June day! Caroline's smile becomes fixed during Toby's speech and she begins to regard him oddly."
caroline," Yeah, heaven on a June day... TOBY What'd he say about you having a job in D.C.? CAROLINE Oh, Helen found me something in a real estate office, but... TOBY So now you can go! Oh. Oh! I am so damn glad to get out of this place! I'll be in 'fourth form.' Doesn't that sound great? And if you get a two-bedroom place in D.C., I can come for vacations and summers. I'm out. I'm out!"
toby,"She holds Toby at arm's length and studies him. CAROLINE My you've grown, haven't you. Then clutches him to her fiercely.   Smiling, the two walk on through the sunny afternoon, singing softly to each other."
120.,"146   EXT. BUS STATION - DAY                                        146 Caroline and Toby stand next to a bus as the driver STARTS the ENGINE. She is close to tears. CAROLINE Are you sure you'll be all right? TOBY  I borrowed money from everybody I know -- it's the two hundred you need for the tuition, and an extra fifty. Buy yourself a blazer. Oh, God. I'll miss you. I'll write you. You sure your hand's okay? TOBY Get on the bus, Mom. Caroline puts her arms around Toby, kisses his cheek hard, then whispers something into his ear. When Toby speaks, his words are full of love: TOBY I know that, Mom. I've always known that. Caroline gets onto the bus, the DOORS CLOSE, WHOOSH and the bus pulls away. We see Caroline's face at a window. As the bus recedes, Toby turns and walks in another direction. His face is shining, incandescent with happiness. He breaks into a wide grin."
