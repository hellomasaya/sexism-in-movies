1.,SCREEN is BLACK.      In white letters we read: BALTIMORE 1963. FADE IN: 1   EXT. CADILLAC DEALERSHIP - DAY                                   1 BILL BABOWSKY  Who?
salesman,What? BB Who's the beauty? SALESMAN The car. BB I thought maybe you saw some chick walking by. I lost my concentration. Why do they call cars 'she'? They never say 'he'... always 'she.' The Salesman shrugs his shoulders.      BB walks around the Cadillac. BB Very nice... very nice.
2.,"3   CONTINUED:                                              3 Peeking around the bannister from the second floor is ERNEST TILLEY, also in his 30's, handsome in a boyish way. TILLEY Who's sick? NORA Who do ya think I'm screaming at? How many of you are there up there? There's only you, and you're a sick human being. TILLEY  Where's my white on white shirt? The nice one, you know. NORA It's like yelling through a wall to you. I'm carrying on about what a disgusting human being you are, and all you want to know is where your white on white shirt is. TILLEY Yes, the one with the permanent stays. CUT TO:"
3.,"4   CONTINUED:                                               4 SALESMAN I'm just trying to get an idea how much you're willing to pay. BB Four dollars... I want to pay four dollars a month. SALESMAN That's not an honest answer. BB What do ya want to hear? That I'd love to pay three hundred and fifty a month... is that what you want to hear? Tell me how much you want me to pay and I'll tell you how much I'll pay, but don't do a hustle on me... I don't like that. How much do I want to pay? I'd like to pay nothing! CUT TO:"
4.,"6   CONTINUED:                                              6 SALESMAN If you even have the smallest problem, call me personally and I'll just shoot you straight into the service department. BB And I get a loaner if the car's got to stay? SALESMAN As we discussed, you get a car if the car has to be kept overnight. BB I get a loaner? The Salesman nods. CUT TO:"
5.,"9    INT. TILLEY'S CAR - DAY                                      9 Tilley is doing neck exercises, rolling his head from left to right as he drives. He sees a red light ahead and starts to slow down, continuing to roll his head."
6.,"14   CONTINUED                                                      14 BB There's a red light, I'm making a space for myself... that's what I'm doing, in order to get into the street... that's something ya do! TILLEY You came out of nowhere... you bolted out of no place... bolted out of nowhere. BB Bolted! At six miles an hour I'm bolting into the street! You schmuck! You schmuck! He moves toward Tilley. TILLEY Back away from me, do ya hear me? Back away from me. BB Back away? You want me to back away? I'll back away. He turns to walk away from Tilley, walks and then turns back and kicks in the headlight of Tilley's car. TILLEY You're a fucking lunatic! He goes for BB, jumps him and they both fall on to the trunk of BB's car. People have started to gather and immediately jump in and pull BB and Tilley apart."
bb,"You're a madman! Smashes into me, attacks me... the man is crazy! People continue to pull them apart. MAN #1 Come on now, calm down, calm down. He holds BB's arms. Another MAN grabs for Tilley and tries to pull him off BB. MAN #2 Take it easy... take it easy... "
7.,"14   CONTINUED:    Get  this guy! Will ya get this guy?   Backs in front of me, and then  kicks my headlight in... and  I'm crazy. You lunatic! Tilley makes another jump for BB.    Again, people try pulling them apart. BB You're going to prison. Death! Death! They're going to give you death!"
8.,"15   CONTINUED:                                              15 GIL, who is pouring half a pound of sugar into his coffee, looks up. GIL Ben Cartwright had a colored guy stay overnight at the Ponderosa? MOUSE, who is picking his teeth with a matchbook, squints at Sam with an investigative look. MOUSE Did he know this guy personally? SAM No... he was just passing through, asked if he could stay over, and Ben Cartwright said 'sure thing.' It doesn't make any sense... he invites a strange colored guy in... invited him in to stay. Is that crazy or what? If a colored guy came to my door and said 'can I stay the night,' I'd tell him 'get the fuck out of here'! It's nothing personal, mind you. MOUSE You're not a bigot, is that what you're telling us? SAM Me?   No, I'm not a bigot. GIL If you're not, how come you're making such a big thing out of it?"
sam,"It's the fact the Ben Cartwright's on the Ponderosa... he's in the middle of nowhere. It's not like he's living on Reisterstown Road with houses all around... we're talking about the West here. It's the idea that a strange guy comes to the door in the middle of the West. It doesn't make sense, that's all I'm saying. MOUSE Come on... you're a bigot, that's what you are. "
9.,"15   CONTINUED:                                                15 SAM Listen, I'll sell tin to anybody ... I don't care who he is. A mark's a mark, whether he's Chinese, Indian or from Mars... I'm thoroughly integrated. Makes no difference to me... I just wouldn't have one of those guys sleep in my house. CUT TO:"
sam,"I just don't believe that 'Bonanza' is an accurate description of the West. I say no more. Tilley slips into the booth next to Sam.    He indicates for Sam to give him more room. TILLEY Come on, give me a couple of more inches. SAM You want me to take my plate... I'll eat in the parking lot. "
10.,"17   CONTINUED:                                              17 TILLEY Come on, Sam, I'm having a terrible morning. You're not going to believe this, some guy just crashed into me... right in the middle of the street... then he attacks me. One of the loonies. SAM  Did ya live? MOUSE Did you get his name?"
tilley,"Yeah, I got his name. The police came... God, I can't believe it... the guy's an idiot. He pulls a piece of paper from his pocket. TILLEY Yeah, here it is... some Polish name... Babowski... Bill Babowski ... fucking son of a bitch. GIL I know the guy... they call him BB. TILLEY You know the son of a bitch? GIL Yeah, he works with Bagel. TILLEY He sells aluminum siding? I don't believe it... of all the people that could run into me, it has to be a fucking tin man. How come I don't know him? GIL You musta seen him. He hangs out with Carly Benelli, Cheese ... you know, that group. TILLEY I don't know the guy. "
11.,17   CONTINUED:   
12.,"17   CONTINUED:                                                   17 Florence starts to walk away. FLORENCE You're always just asking. Gil still talking about BB. GIL I'm telling you, you just can't believe how well this guy does the Marengay. MOUSE I can't wait to see it."
tilley,"I'll  tell you one thing,    when I get a  hold of this guy,    I'll break  both his legs and    then he won't  dance the Marengay    too good. CUT TO:"
13.,"19   CONTINUED:                                               19 GIRL #1  Yes... well, we do aluminum siding which improves the appearance of your house, and improves the insulation... CAMERA MOVES TO ANOTHER GIRL. GIRL #2 ... Which improves the appearance of your house, and improves the insulation..."
14.,"19   CONTINUED:                                                    19 MOE That's right, the guy picks    it up. He gets a phone call... it's    the doctor on the line. Doctor     says 'I've got some bad news and    some worse news.' BB join the tin men to listen to Moe's joke. MOE Guy    says 'Well, let me hear the bad    news first.' 'The bad news is,    you've got twenty-four hours to    live.' The guy says 'What's the    worse news?' Doctor says 'I    forgot to call you yesterday.' They all laugh. LOONEY, a thin guy who twitches and blinks a lot, stands up. LOONEY It's good... I like it. CHEESE I never heard bad news and worse news... smart joke. LOONEY Yeah... I like it. CARLY It's dumb, but good. BB, who is not laughing, stands behind Cheese who throws 50 cents into the card game."
cheese,"Up it fifty cents. LOONEY I call... I call. I'm in on this one... I call. MOE We get it, you're calling. CARLY I'm not sure. BB Stay with him. CARLY I don't know. "
15.,19   CONTINUED:   
16.,"19   CONTINUED:                                                19 LOONEY Six hundred bucks? I'd get rid of the car. That much damage it won't be any good. You may have dented the frame. BB I didn't dent the frame. LOONEY When you hit the frame, the car doesn't ride right. BB He didn't hit the frame! I'll tell you this, I'm gonna get the son of a bitch. If he would have apologized or something, but this guy gets out, tries to push me around. CHEESE You're kidding me? BB Yeah... the guy's totally off the wall. He takes a sip of his coffee. BB I'm gonna get him... just for the fun of it. CUT TO:"
17.,"21   CONTINUED:                                              21 MOE Now, let me see... we gotta be at the Hickey house at four.  It's about three-twenty now... we've got some time on our hands. You want to get some coffee? BB No, I'm up to here with the coffee. He indicates his throat."
moe,They got any good pool halls around here? BB I don't know.  Yeah. CUT TO:
18.,"23   CONTINUED:                                              23 BB I think this  is a better position... the light is  hitting it, which is accentuating  the effect we're going for.   It's very good... very good. MOE  This shows the flaws in the structure... CUT TO:"
19.,"24   CONTINUED:                                              24 MOE Oh, I hope we're not disturbing you, ma'am. We're with Life Magazine... we'll be out of here in just a minute. BB "
20.,24   CONTINUED:   
21.,"24   CONTINUED:    What time would your husband be home, 'cos he'd have to go over the figures with the salesman... that's if there's a salesman available this evening. HOUSEWIFE He'll be home at seven. BB We might be able to work it. HOUSEWIFE That would be wonderful. CUT TO:"
22.,"25   INT. WOODEN FRAMED HOUSE - NIGHT                            25 BB and Moe are sitting on a sofa sipping coffee, looking as if they were members of the family. The Housewife and her HUSBAND are sitting across the dining room table from Carly. Carly is going  through papers, adding up figures. CARLY Okay... we've got a total of thirty-seven hundred dollars. HUSBAND Thirty-seven hundred dollars? HOUSEWIFE Honey, we're gonna be in Life Magazine."
24.,"30   CONTINUED:                                               30 HUSBAND #2 No... not this time. TILLEY Well, as I said, you can always reach me... you've got my card, and when the time comes, let's talk. The Husband and wife stand to show Tilley to the door. TILLEY Hey, give my best to your little son... wonderful kid there. What's his name again, Ronnie?"
sam,"The amount of time you spent there, I thought you were ready to send for me to close it up. TILLEY Damn!    I thought I had 'em. Tilley STARTS the CAR and pulls out. CUT TO:"
25.,"32   CONTINUED:                                              32 PIANIST 'Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes each one she passes goes... ""Ah!""' The last word of the verse -- ""Ah"" -- has great emphasis put on it and is lengthened considerably. The people sitting around the piano all join the pianist and say ""Ah"" in unison. CAMERA MOVES OVER TO a table where Mouse, Sam, Tilley, Gil and a few other tin men set. WING, the head of Gibraltar Aluminum, a tall, strong, imposing figure, holds court. The table is filled with papers, folders, etc., as if Wing's office desk had been trans- ported to the bar. He's reviewing a paper from a job that Mouse has done. WING Forty-six hundred dollars. This looks like a sound deal. They own their own house... we won't have any problem getting the financing for them. Real good, Mouse. He picks up his check book ledger and writes out a check. WING "
26.,"32   CONTINUED:                                                  32 TILLEY No problem... just in a little slump here. WING Don't try to go walking on me. TILLEY What do you mean, walking? You think I'm gonna work somewhere else... you've been very good to me... very honorable. SAM He's always said that about you, Wing. Always said that about you... he has. WING I'll give you hundred and fifty. TILLEY Wing, I need a bit more than that... I got expenses. WING What's wrong with your wife?   She doesn't work? TILLEY Yeah, but how much is she gonna make working at the Social Security office? Wing writes out a check and gives it to Tilley."
tilley,"Come on, Wing, can't you do better than this... a man in my position in terms of this firm... I dunno... WING All right, I'll give you two hundred. Wing changes amount of check and hands it to Tilley. MOUSE "
27.,"32   CONTINUED:    Did she hear me say scotch straight up? WING My sources tell me this Home Improvement Commission is for real... it's no jackpot. These guys are going to be a real pain in the ass, so any of the scams that you guys are pulling, they get wind of it, they take your license and it's goodbye to this business. MOUSE They take away your license? They take away your livelihood? What kind of people are these? SAM They have no respect for the working man. TILLEY Which scams are they talking about? They got a list?"
wing,"Any irregularities, you know, selling a house on the pretense that it's a model house and every job sold in the area they get a kickback... the Life Magazine hustle... you guys know all the bullshit numbers we can run. SAM Jesus! What a pain in the ass. Do you think this commission's gonna stick around or is it gone with the wind? "
28.,32   CONTINUED:                                                32 TILLEY They take your license? CUT TO:
29.,"34   CONTINUED:                                              35 BB I'll be back, Moe.    I'm gonna even the score. He gets out of the car, quickly walks over to Tilley's Cadillac, and with a swift kick, he kicks the headlight that isn't already broken. CUT TO:"
30.,"35   CONTINUED:                                              35 TILLEY I don't know the guy! GIL I'll never forget his Marengay. TILLEY I'll tell you something, if Mr. Marengay wants to play... we'll play. CUT TO:"
31.,37   CONTINUED:                                              37 TILLEY What're you doing up so late? NORA We're off tomorrow. Beat. TILLEY I think this place may be a little too large for us. NORA What are you talking about... this match box?
tilley,"It's got a lot of overhead to it. What do you do... spend your time in the bedroom and the kitchen, that's all. So why do you need a living room and a dining room. He walks over to the back door and looks out. TILLEY Why do ya need a back yard? NORA You're not selling anything? TILLEY I'm in a slump. NORA It happens."
tilley,"Last year I'm number three top seller... year before, right up there. I  can't get my momentum going this year. NORA Well, you will. You always do. TILLEY "
32.,37   CONTINUED:    I'm gonna take a bath -- my neck's been tight since this morning. NORA I'll turn out the lights. Nora gets up and puts the cups in the sink -- gives a big sigh. CUT TO:
33.,"38   CONTINUED:                                             38 TILLEY I don't understand a picnic... we just go some place... we put a thing on the ground, and we eat. NORA Yes... it's nice to do that. TILLEY Why? I don't get it. It's better sitting at home and watching TV. NORA I think there's something nice about a picnic... it's fun. TILLEY What's fun about it? Ants get into the food... there's bees. I don't get it. We have to drive, it takes maybe an hour to get there, then you sit in grass and eat. Why is that fun? NORA I just thought it might be nice to do something together, that's all... thought it might be fun. TILLEY It doesn't sound like fun to me... you take the stuff you've got here in the house, you take it someplace to eat it. It's just as much fun eating in front of the TV, and we do that together, don't we? No ants and no bees... much more comfortable. NORA It's not the same thing. TILLEY Scrub my back, will ya, Nora. Nora picks up the back brush, puts soap on it and starts scrubbing Tilley's back. "
34.,"38   CONTINUED:    Don't get me wrong, I'm willing to do anything with you. I'm just a little stymied by a picnic. If you want to go, send me a postcard. Nora drops the brush in the tub and walks out of the bathroom. TILLEY What did I say?"
35.,"40   CONTINUED:                                             40 TILLEY I'll show the son of a bitch. He gets out of the car, crosses to BB's Cadillac, and smashes in the windshield and all of the windows of the car. TILLEY  Quick, Tilley... let's get out of here. Tilley runs back to his car and drives away. CUT TO:"
another angle,We see BAGEL. He's a little guy with a black Fedora and baggy pants held up with suspenders. BB stands with him. BAGEL This whole section has been very fertile for us. CUT TO: 
36.,"41   CONTINUED:                                              41 ANOTHER ANGLE Moe, Looney and Carly are talking to STANLEY FRANKS, a young guy in his early 20's. He is dressed in the ""Ivy League"" look of the times. MOE  What's the best way to qualify a mark?"
stanley,"What? MOE How do you know if you can get the upper hand? How do you know if you're dealing with a guy who's in an inferior position to you, or superior position? How do you know? Moe puts Stanley on the defensive. STANLEY You just have to talk and feel your way. "
37.,41   CONTINUED:    Me and Stanley. It's like a first date. CUT TO:
38.,"42   EXT. SUPERIOR ALUMINUM SIDING BUILDING - DAY                     42 BB and Moe approach BB's Cadillac. He sees that all the windows have been smashed in. Moe looks to BB. Looney walks up from behind. LOONEY What? You got a special bargain when you bought this car? They come cheaper without windows? BB reaches into the car and picks up a handful of broken glass. He tosses it up and down in his hands. BB This guy's looking to play tit for tat. That's not my game. I'm gonna play hardball. BB throws the glass down on the ground. STANLEY  What's going on? Looney just nods for them to go, and they start to walk over to Looney's Cadillac. BB I'm gonna find    out everything about this son    of a bitch, and then I'm gonna    find the one thing that cuts him    to the quick. MOE Let's go inside... make some calls."
39.,"43   CONTINUED:                                              43 MOUSE Well, then, believe it. There's no sense not to believe it, because you did it... so believe it. That's twenty more... you owe me sixty. TILLEY You think I can't add? He goes to rack to re-set. Mouse     goes over and puts a nickel in the juke box. A RECORD     slips into position, and Harry Belafonte's ""Banana Boat    Song"" begins. Mouse, in unison with the record, sings,    and is totally caught up in the song."
mouse,"'Dayo!... da, da, da, da, day. Daylight come and he wanna go home...' He sings very loudly, especially on the chorus. GIL  'Daylight come and he wanna go home...'"
40.,45   INT. POOL HALL                                                45 He approaches Tilley who's just finished racking the balls. SAM Tilley. He nods for Tilley to go over to him. They start to walk together through the darkened areas of the Pool Hall. SAM Found this on your desk while I was going over some papers. He hands the letter to Tilley.
tilley,From the IRS. I never even remember seeing it. I must have left it with my other bills. I wonder what it is? SAM Maybe it's a refund check. Tilley opens the envelope and looks at the document. TILLEY Hum... says here that they haven't received my 1962 taxes. They seem to be saying that they didn't get my check for four thousand dollars. SAM What? It must be a clerical error. TILLEY I can't believe they spend all that time and energy to write to me... to single me out. SAM What are you talking about?   You didn't pay your taxes? TILLEY I probably forgot... people forget their taxes all the time... just slipped my mind... I got so many things on my mind. 
41.,"45   CONTINUED:                                              45 TILLEY  I figured they'd give me a little leeway. I'm going to pay them... I know I've got a debt... I just need a little leeway. SAM You can't mess around with the government. Why don't you go to H & R Block, they'll take care of your taxes for you. TILLEY You think I'm gonna let some schmuck know all my business... have some guy pull me over the coals for spending on this and that. I need some privacy. SAM Taxes is serious stuff, Tilley. TILLEY I can just see that schmuck in that little tax shop telling people my business... how much I make... how much I spend... no way! SAM All I can say, is you better get a lawyer or somebody to look into this, 'cos the IRS, they don't fuck around. TILLEY Just what I need in my life right now... I'm in a slump and I've got the IRS on me. Like when something goes wrong, it's like... He throws his arms up in the air in exasperation. CUT TO:"
42.,"46   EXT. NORA AND TILLEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                46 We see Nora leaving her house,  walking down the    steps and getting into her car. She   STARTS the ENGINE    and pulls away.  CAMERA HOLDS for  a moment, and then    INTO FRAME comes Moe's car with BB  sitting shotgun.     They follow Nora. CUT TO:"
43.,"47   CONTINUED:                                              47 NORA You know what would be a lot more healthy and satisfying is to get yourself a chicken... just pop it in the oven for a couple of hours with a little bit of seasoning on it. Makes a good meal, and you can make sandwiches with the leftovers. BB But then you have to sit and watch it cook. Something seems sad about a man sitting alone in a house and watching a chicken cook."
44.,"50   CONTINUED:                                              50 MAN Thank you, Mr. Tilley. I can't believe it... this is the most generous thing anyone's ever done ... Swell! Like a gift from heaven. WIFE The Lord has certainly blessed us this evening. TILLEY Well, what can I say... I'm a modest person... I just do what I can to help."
man,Thanks again. He opens the door for Tilley and Tilley walks out. CUT TO:
sam,"You're kidding? TILLEY Take a look at this, Sam. Tilley shows him the written contract. Written across the front of the contract in big, bold, black letters are the words: ""THIS JOB IS FREE."" Sam looks at Tilley. SAM Are you fucking crazy? You just gave them forty-two hundred dollars in aluminum siding free?! "
45.,51   CONTINUED:                                                51 TILLEY  This is the best scam I've ever thought of in my whole life. He kisses his hands with wild smacking sounds.     He's ecstatic. TILLEY It's in my blood... I'm brilliant ... I'm fucking brilliant... this is such a brilliant scam... I'm beside myself. SAM What are you talking about? TILLEY Here it is... you go back in the house and this is what you say... CUT TO:
46.,"52   CONTINUED:                                              52 SAM Let me tell you something, when I go and see his boss and show him this contract, he's out of this business... he'll lose his home ... his wife and kids will be thrown out onto the street. He'll probably spend some time in an institution, so God knows what will happen to his wife and kids. Anyway, it's not your problem. MAN Why do they have to be thrown out onto the street?"
sam,"You don't expect his boss to pick up the forty-two hundred job, do ya? MAN Hmm. SAM Yeah, it's a bad state of affairs.  Let me ask you something, sir. MAN Yes? SAM You don't think there's some way you could work with me to try and resolve this, do you?"
man,"How so? SAM Let's look at it this way, what if I can sell you this job at a wholesale price... kind of lessens the burden. The big boss won't get so angry, and maybe won't throw the guy's wife and kids out... at least they'll have a roof over their heads. MAN What kind of wholesale price are we talking about? "

tilley,"Yeah, yeah... I get the point. So? SAM So I see celery, I see the lettuce, tomatoes, cauliflower... and I think, all these things come out of the ground... they just grow out of the ground.

All these things are out of the ground. TILLEY  Yeah."

Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today? BB Yes, I did. I came in  last night, she was sleeping on my side of the bed. In my life I  never got out of bed on the left side... in my life, never from the left.  I got close once up in the Catskills. I met this  girl, Dorian.

TILLEY On second thought, instead of the eggs over, if I ordered soft boiled eggs do you take them out of the shell or leave them in the shells? We can see that BB is getting a little irritable. WAITRESS We leave them in the shell. TILLEY I don't like them that way because they get hot in the hand and it's hard to scoop the stuff out... it's not good... and you get little bits of shell in there and it doesn't taste good.

tilley,"If I'm going to order, at least I ought to be content with my food. BB I'm getting a little hungry... I've got a headache as it is. Just order some eggs so some other people can have something to eat before the lunch trade comes in. TILLEY "

DOWNTOWN STREET - DAY                                    145 Tilley pulls his Cadillac into a parking space just a little up the street from the tobacco warehouse which houses the Home Improvement Commission. He gets out of his car, locks the door and starts down the street. BB's car drives past Tilley. CAMERA FOLLOWS BB's car as he pulls into a parking space close to the Commission building. CUT TO:"
153.,"146   CONTINUED:                                              146 TILLEY You gave them evidence? BB The only way I could think to get out of this business. He smiles. TILLEY  Hey, that's good... that's good, yeah. There's activity in the hallway."
154.,"147   CONTINUED:                                                  147 TILLEY I'm not aware of the section numbers. Sometimes you get a little overzealous in the heat of the sales pitch, that's all. BB is watching the proceedings.      CAMERA HOLDS ON him. MASTERS  Was it the heat of the sales pitch on February 23rd of this year that made you write across a contract 'This Job Is Free'?"
on tilley,"who is falling apart. TILLEY As I remember, no sale was made concerning those customers. MASTERS It fell out because a loan couldn't be arranged, but the people did agree in principle. "
155.,"147   CONTINUED:    We have other specific examples of deceptive sales practices on your behalf concerning a job carried out on December 11, 1962. You violated sections 241 and 247. And concerning a job sold to Mr. and Mrs. DeFranco on October 9, 1962, violations of sections 251 and 257 took place. TILLEY What are all these numbers here? I'm not familiar with all these section violations."
on bb,"who is watching the proceedings intently. MASTERS  It is the feeling of this commission that these infractions are severe violations of the Home Improvement Laws, and therefore constitute misuse of the license to sell aluminum siding as approved by this state."
156.,"147   CONTINUED:                                              147 BACK TO MASTERS MASTERS Thank you, Mr. Tilley. You may hand over your license to the clerk of the commission on your way out."
tilley,"gets up from the table and goes to the back of the room to exit the building. He stops at a desk just inside the door where the clerk is sitting. Tilley pulls out his wallet, takes out a small document, and throws it down on the desk. He exits the building. CUT TO:"
157.,"149   CONTINUED:                                                 149 KID Did you have a car parked here? A Cadillac? TILLEY Yeah.   What about it? KID A man told me to say they took it. TILLEY Who took it? KID Man said, the tax man.     Gave me a dollar to tell you so. Tilley walks over and stands in the empty space where his car had been. TILLEY Tax man! Fucking I.R.S. How low can you get? How low can you get? He walks around in the space as if somehow his car might reappear. He mumbles to himself. TILLEY They're lowlife. How can people come and take a man's car?... His Cadillac? CUT TO:"
158.,"150   CONTINUED:                                             150 BB BB  Thank you. BB gets up and walks to the back of the  room. He stops at the same desk as Tilley, but instead  of going into his wallet like Tilley, he just reaches  into his suit pocket, pulls out a license document and  tosses it onto the table. Then he heads out the door. CUT TO:"
tilley,This is where my car used to be. BB Stolen? TILLEY I.R.S. Fucking bandits! Bandits! Thieving sons of bitches! BB looks at Tilley for a beat. BB You need a ride uptown? TILLEY I could use one. 
159.,"151   CONTINUED:                                            151 BB Come on. They cross the street and go toward BB's Cadillac. BB gets in the driver's side, Tilley gets in the passenger side, and the car pulls out. CUT TO:"
160.,"153   CONTINUED:                                              153 TILLEY Nickels and dimes. You got a good point there, BB. You're right on the money with that kind of thinking. BB stops the car at a stop sign. Something catches BB's eye. THROUGH the windshield we see a Volkswagen ""beetle"" going from right to left."
bb,Gotta find a new business to get into. TILLEY New? Very hard to find something new to get into. BB puts his foot on the gas and starts to drive. BB Maybe... maybe not. TILLEY Better put on my thinking cap... not easy to think of something new. CUT TO:
