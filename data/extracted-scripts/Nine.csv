Speaker,Dialogue
final script,"November 11, 2009"
guido,"You kill your film several times, mostly by talking about it. A film is a dream. You kill it writing it down, you kill it with a camera; the film might come to life for a moment or two when your actors breathe life back into it - but then it dies again, buried in film cans. Mysteriously, sometimes, in the editing room, a miracle happens when you place one image next to another so that when, finally, an audience sits in the dark, if you're lucky -- very lucky - and sometimes I've been lucky - the dream flickers back to life again. That's why I'm secretive."
guido,"Finally, a serious question."
studio superintendent,"Good luck, Maestro."
dante, Guido! You're here.
guido,"Buongiorno, Dante."
dante,I've been looking for you all over the place. The set's coming along. How are you?
guido,"Bene, grazie, bene."
dante,"Bene. My God, you look terrible, better go to makeup, forget you've got a press conference?"
fausto, He has no tie.
dante,"Yes, makeup and wardrobe."
fausto," Signor Contini, I'm Fausto.     Good morning, Signor Contini. p. 4"
dante," Don't speak to him, I speak to him."
fausto,"Okay, I have some questions for Signor Contini."
guido,We all have questions for Signor Contini.
fausto,"Yes, but please, please, I think it's customary for there to be an approved script and budget before filming commences..."
guido,Is he going to follow us?
fausto,"It's not my intention to be difficult. Maestro, I am a huge admirer of Maestro Contini's movies, your early films are...everybody loves them and... I consider it a great honour for me to be here now... none the less, I need a script and a budget."
pierpaolo,Where do you want your messages?
guido,On my desk.
pierpaolo,There's no room on your desk.
guido,Under my desk. In the trash. Non lo so.
pierpaolo, Some of these are urgent!
guido, Get me a cigarette.
jaconelli, We will never be ready to shoot in ten days.
guido,Jaconelli -
fausto, Not ready?!
guido, p. 6
dante,"He's not exactly from the bank, Guido."
benito,"Dottore, Dottore. You have actors waiting for you in your office. Auditions all morning. You should see what I've found. I found two sisters. Look, they're right..."
dante,Not now. He's got the Press Conference.
guido,I need a cigarette.
dante,"He needs a shirt and tie, Lilli."
guido,I need a coffee and a cigarette.
lilli," Answer a question, I'll give you a coffee. Answer another question, I'll give you a cigarette. And so on."
guido,Actually and an aspirin.
dante, We're running late...
lilli," Calm down. Directing a movie is a very overrated job, we all know it. You just have to say yes or no. What else do you do? Nothing. Maestro - Should this be Red? Yes. Green? No. More extras? Yes. More lipstick? No. Yes, no, yes, no, yes, no - that's directing."
guido,"That's right: that's directing. And it doesn't seem to make a blind bit of difference, finally, what the answer is..."
lilli,"So please, Guido, yes or no, do you want any costumes in this film?"
guido,Yes. p. 8
lilli,You see - simple!  Might I know what period the movie's in?
guido,"Yes, yes.  Soon."
lilli,You know I don't allow producers in here.
dante,Alright. Two minutes Guido.
lilli,He's gone. Have you written a word of the script?
guido,No.
lilli,Are you in a panic?
guido,Yes.
lilli,Is Luisa going with you to the Press Conference?
guido,No. Nobody. Dante.    And his spy.
lilli,You need to shave.    You look terrible. p. 9
guido, Why is there no fire escape in here? What if somebody needed to escape? I can't face these reporters. I have nothing to say.
lilli,"You'll be fine. You're a world class liar, darling, go out there and lie for Italy, lie for Italia."
guido,"What the hell's wrong with me? I can't sleep. I can't think. I can't write. I can't breathe. My heart is racing. Am I dying, Mamma? I owe you flowers, I know. I'll come to the cemetery at the weekend. You should have let me bury you in Roma, Mamma, I could visit you every week. Don't look at me like that."
mamma," Oh, Guido, Guido."
mamma,"This is your Rome, Guido. The world sees Rome the way you invented it. Your films did that."
guido, I miss you.
mamma,"I miss you, too."
radio reporter,And we're just waiting for the arrival of Contini...any moment now - Could this film put the Maestro back on top?
dante,"Silenzio, per favore...Thank you, thank you..."
radio reporter,"Dante, Guido Contini's long time producer, is about to speak..."
dante,"I want to say a few words from my heart. I am humbled and thrilled to be able to announce that I am producing Guido Contini's next film, Italia, which will star once again Contini's longtime inspiration, the international film star, Claudia Jenssen..."
guido,"Thanks for coming, everybody."
dinardo,Maestro Contini. Maestro Contini.
guido,Yes.
dinardo,"Grazie. Maestro Contini, your new film is called Italia... big title."
guido,"Actually, it's my shortest title yet."
dinardo,But hardly a modest one.
guido,"Films are not modest. They cost too much, they take too long, and they involve too many people. So they should have grand titles."
dinardo,And might you tell the press what the film is about?
guido,Why? I still don't know what my last film was about.
leopardi, That was the problem. Nobody else did.
guido,"Of course I can tell you what my film is about...I can tell you the story, I can tell you who I am going to cast, the music I want to use, I can tell you everything... but... I... won't. I'm afraid that if I say anything, the word might get out to the Press."
dante,"Our next film will be exactly as it sounds. Italia. It's the very spirit of Italy - Italy as myth, Italy as a woman, Italy as a dream."
leopardi,Is this true?
guido,It sounds fantastic.    I can't wait to see it.
stephanie,Signor Contini.
guido,Stephanie.
stephanie,Grazie. Could you tell the fashionable women of America who your favorite designer is this year?
guido,I'm less interested in the wrapping than what might be inside it.
reporter one,"Signor Contini! You're a man of the world, yes? Educated in Britain, a home in Biarritz. With Italia is it fair to say that you've come home for good?"
guido,For good?
reporter four,"It's been a long time since you made a movie with your wife, do you plan on casting her in this new film?"
guido,I told Luisa that when we got married I would never again make love to my leading lady.
reporter four,But she hasn't worked at all since working with you.
reporter five,But why are you being so tight-lipped about this film? It's a serious question. What's the big deal? p. 14
guido,I WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE.
guido,You want me to be serious? In a Press Conference?
guido,I WOULD LIKE TO BE THERE
guido,I thought I was the clown in this circus.
guido,I WOULD LIKE TO BE EVERYWHERE AT ONCE I KNOW THAT'S A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS.
leopardi,"Signor Contini. Artists do their best work before they're famous. Now you're famous. Without wishing to be negative - but your last two films, they're not, they were..."
guido,Flops.
leopardi,Your word. Flops. p. 15
guido,"AND IT'S A PROBLEM, ESPECIALLY WHEN MY BODY'S NEARING FIFTY AS MY MIND IS NEARING TEN."
leopardi,I'm just asking if you're nervous? You seem nervous...
guido,Excuse me?
leopardi,"What I'm asking, Maestro, is have you run out of things to say?"
guido,"I CAN HARDLY STAY UP AND I CAN'T GET TO SLEEP, AND I DON'T WANT TO WAKE TOMORROW MORNING, AT THE BOTTOM OF SOME HEAP BUT WHY TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY? AFTER ALL, THERE'S NOTHING AT STAKE HERE - ONLY ME I WANT TO BE YOUNG. AND I WANT TO BE OLD. I WOULD LIKE TO BE WISE BEFORE MY TIME AND YET BE FOOLISH AND BRASH AND BOLD. I WOULD LIKE THE UNIVERSE TO GET DOWN ON ITS KNEES AND SAY, ""GUIDO, WHATEVER YOU PLEASE, IT'S OKAY EVEN IF IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, WE'LL ARRANGE IT."" THAT'S ALL THAT I WANT. p. 16"
stephanie,I was wondering if you think there's a limit to what you can show in a movie.
guido,What would you like to see that I haven't already shown you?
guido,"I AM LUSTING FOR MORE, SHOULD I SETTLE FOR LESS? I ASK YOU, WHAT'S A GOOD THING FOR IF NOT FOR TAKING IT TO EXCESS? ONE LIMITATION I DEARLY REGRET: THERE'S ONLY ONE OF ME I'VE EVER MET."
guido,I WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE  ME! I WANT TO BE PROUST... p. 17
guido,"...I WANT TO BE YOUNG, BUT I HAVE TO BE OLD. WHAT I WANT IS A TALE OF SOUND AND FURY THAT SOME IDIOT WENT AND TOLD. I WOULD LIKE THE UNIVERSE TO GET DOWN ON ITS KNEES AND SAY, ""GUIDO, WHATEVER YOU PLEASE, IT'S OKAY EVEN IF IT'S RIDICULOUS, WE'LL ARRANGE IT..."""
guido,SO ARRANGE IT!
women,ARRANGE IT!
guido,THAT'S ALL THAT I WANT! p. 18
guido,I need a room.
de rossi,Of course. p. 19
guido,A suite.
de rossi,Yes.
guido,With a view of the sea. A balcony. Something with air.
de rossi,All of our suites have air... let me just look for you.
guido,I've come from Milano.
de rossi,I understand.
guido,On business.    I'm a businessman. Busy busy busy.
de rossi, Would Maestro Contini prefer to register under a pseudonym?
guido, Please.
de rossi, Signor Milano?
guido,Why not.
de rossi," Needless to say, I love your films. Guilty pleasure. Those early films."
guido,"Not the flops.  I need to see a doctor. Do you know one who's discreet...? I'd like to see him today, in my room, now, if possible."
de rossi,Consider it done. Please. p. 20
guido, And I need to place a call.   To my wife.
de rossi,You can take the call at the lobby phone over there.
guido,"Luisa, tesoro..."
luisa,There you are.
guido,Is everybody mad at me?
luisa,"Well, I'm mad at you.   Where are you?"
guido,I had to escape from the Press Conference.
luisa,I heard. Dramatic.
guido,"Don't tease me. I'm sick, Luisa."
luisa,"You're making a film. You make a film, you get sick. It's what happens."
guido,"No, but this time I'm really sick.      I can't breathe. p. 21"
luisa,Are you by yourself?
guido,"Yes, of course I'm by myself."
luisa,Then shall I come?
guido,"Yes, please come, that's why I'm calling, please come straight away. That would be wonderful."
luisa,Okay.
guido,Great. Marvellous.
luisa,I don't know where you are.
guido,"I don't know, some spa.   Horrible.   I just kept driving."
luisa,Well I can't come if I don't know where you are.
guido," And, actually, it's hardly worth it. I'll be home in a day or two."
luisa," Yes, it's hardly worth it."
guido,But I do wish you were here.
luisa,"Get some rest, take the waters, sleep, then come back here and make a good movie."
guido,I love you.
luisa,Get better. p. 22
de rossi,Your doctor is on his way.
guido," This number - if a woman answers you put it through to my room, otherwise..."
de rossi,It's a wrong number.
guido,What?
nurse,Dottore.
doctor rondi,Si?
guido,What is she whispering? Is it my blood pressure? Is it serious? Am I dying?
doctor, Check again.
carla,GUIDO...
carla,GUIDO...
doctor,...the Roman emperors came here for the waters...
guido, Pronto. p. 24
carla,"I WAS LAZING AROUND MY BEDROOM WHEN YOU CALLED AND AN IDEA OCCURRED TO ME I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING ABOUT, GUIDO..."
guido," It's a very an important call, Doctor. I'm sorry, I have to take it. Private call."
doctor,As you wish.
carla,"WHO'S NOT WEARING ANY CLOTHES? I'M NOT! MY DARLING, WHO'S AFRAID TO KISS YOUR TOES? I'M NOT! YOUR MAMA DEAR IS BLOWING INTO YOUR EAR, SO YOU'LL GET IT LOUD AND CLEAR, I NEED YOU TO SQUEEZE ME HERE... AND HERE... AND HERE..."
nurse,Doctor... His pulse... it's racing.
doctor, Is something wrong?
guido,"What? Yes, yes. It's about my film. It's from the Vatican. Go ahead, Monsignore! Yes, yes, of course, I'm listening."
carla,"COOTCHIE, COOTCHIE, COOTCHIE COO. I'VE GOT A PLAN FOR WHAT I'M GONNA DO TO YOU, SO HOT YOU'RE GONNA STEAM, AND SCREAM, AND VIBRATE LIKE A STRING I'M PLUCKING- KISS YOUR FEVERED LITTLE BROW PINCH YOUR CHEEKS TILL YOU SAY ""OW,"" AND I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO SHOW YOU HOW, GUIDO."
carla,"WHO WON'T CARE IF YOU COME TO ME TIRED AND OVERWORKED? I WON'T! BAMBINO, WHO KNOWS A THERAPY TO BEAT WHAT YOU CAN GET FROM ME? I DON'T! BUT THIS WILL HAVE TO BE ENOUGH FOR NOW, GUIDO, CIAO.  p. 26"
carla,Guido!    Ciao!
guido, Carla!
carla,I'm so happy to see you.
guido,Carlissima.
carla,I missed you so much.  Are you happy I'm here?
guido,Of course.
carla,But very happy? Or just a little happy?
guido,Very happy.
carla,"What's wrong? You look very tired, very tired. p. 27"
guido," Carla, all those bags for the weekend?"
carla,"Yes, the Bellavista is a very fashionable place. You know I stayed there with my parents, during the war, it was full of Germans."
guido,Carla... I have to tell you... they found out who I am at the hotel--
carla,No...
guido,"... yes, horrible, but obviously we don't want to be followed by the press, so I found the most charming pensione for you, and it's right here. It's charming."
carla,Here at the station?
carla,What? p. 28
guido,"Shhh! Yes, count to ten and come back in, and pretend you're in the wrong room, and I'm a complete stranger--"
carla,I love your games!
guido,I'm here on business.
carla,Okay.
guido,"Go, go.   Wait. Your face."
carla,What about it?
guido,Get your makeup.
carla,"I had a nightmare last night. We were in that little alley behind Piazza Navona, where I bought you that scarf, remember? The same one your wife bought you--"
guido," Don't move, Carla."
carla,"When you wear it, I never know if it's hers or mine."
guido, Uh-huh.
carla,"So we were there, on the ground, naked, kissing, and we didn't care, and then my husband arrived and killed us both with a shovel! Poor Luigi!  p. 29"
guido, Good for him.
carla,Perhaps there's a job for him in the movie--
guido,Why not?
carla,You could work well together.
guido,Beautiful. When you come in I want you to be my little savage.
carla,Yes.
guido," Go, go."
carla,You think I am one of your actresses?
guido,"Hurry, please, Carla."
carla,"Oh, Madonna!"
guido,I'll pretend to be asleep.
carla,What if I really found the wrong room? Would you be jealous? p. 30
guido,Could you do such a thing?
carla, Hm! Who knows?
guido,What happened?
carla, It was the woman from the hotel. She wanted to give me towels.
guido,Come here.
carla,Okay.
guido,What?
carla,"You are a stranger, I don't know you."
guido,"Carla, just come here.  Be savage. Show me."
carla,Excuse me! I've got the wrong room.
guido,"Yes, you have. And I don't have the faintest idea who you are."
guido,"Excuse me, father..."
cardinal's secretary, Buongiorno.
guido,"His Excellency, the Cardinal, is he -?"
cardinal's secretary, I am a big fan.
guido,I would very much like to speak to the Cardinal. Do you think he might grant me -
cardinal's secretary,Is Claudia Jenssen with you?
guido,No.
cardinal's secretary,Pity. His excellency is a big admirer of Signorina Jenssen.
guido," I'm in need of some guidance, some pointers..."
cardinal's secretary,Do you think you could find a signed photograph of Signorina Jenssen? p. 33
guido,For His Excellency?
cardinal's secretary,Si.
guido,I'm sure that would be possible...
cardinal's secretary,"Truly?   What a pleasure. Arrivederci, Maestro."
dante,Guidino!
guido,I'm not going to ask how you found me.
dante,Please - it's my job. A producer needs to know where his director is at all times...even to know the pensione where his mistress is staying...
guido,Oh God.
dante,"I understand, Guido. Rome is absolutely unbearable. The pressure. It's no good."
guido,Really?    You understand?
dante,Of course I understand.      Absolutely.
guido,You're not going to drag me back?
dante,No. You're a genius and genius must be served. p. 34
guido,"Thank you, my old friend.  Where are we going?"
dante,You can't be in Rome. Okay. 
dante,Rome will come to you!
jaconelli," Yes, with the flower and the glass and the arches of the Roman Empire..."
dante,Guido...you remember Donatella.
donatella,Ciao.
guido, Ciao.
dante,"Donatella, you tested her."
donatella,I was very nervous. He probably doesn't remember. I was quite nervous. p. 35
guido," No, I remember you. You were, we all enjoyed you, so to speak."
pierpaolo,Maestro...
guido, Pierpaolo!
pierpaolo," Yes, I'm sorry. Right now."
guido,"Cretino!  Yes, yes, that's what I say, people just don't realise - she's an actress as well as a star - I know Dante's dying to talk to you. A dolpo. Ciao."
dante,Lombardo... p. 36
guido,"Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!"
lilli,I'm happy. I brought my swimsuit.
guido,What? No. Oh please God. No. I spoke with her yesterday. She didn't even mention it. Give me a cigarette.
lilli,What's that?
guido,What's that?
lilli,It's for Claudia.
guido,For which scene?
lilli,"Well I don't know which scene until I`ve seen the script, but she always likes something like this, or you do."
guido,Looks like the Folies Bergere. It's wrong. Italian women don't wear those things. p. 37
lilli,Don't knock the Folies Bergere...
guido,Why did people love that film?
lilli,"Oh Guido, don't. That's death.     Every time we have to start again."
guido,I'm trying to find it.
lilli,You won't find it with your head jammed halfway up your ass.
guido,Ashtray.
lilli,"Halfway. I don't know. Why not dream up something entertaining, Guido? Something with music...with dancing... God knows, we could use a little joie de vivre around here..."
lilli," LE CINEMA TODAY IS IN A CRISIS DIRECTORS ARE SO EXISTENTIALISTES. THE MOVIES ARE NOT WORTH THEIR ENTRANCE PRICES IF NO ONE SINGS A LOVE SONG WHEN HE'S KISSED. LOVE CANNOT BE LOVE WITHOUT ""LE SINGING,"" A STRING, A CLARINET, A SAXOPHONE TAKE A LESSON FROM THIS OLD PARISIENNE AND THE FINEST ENTERTAINMENT SHE HAS KNOWN."
lilli,"BY THE HEAVENS ABOVE, YOU WILL SWEAR THERE'S NOTHING RARER!"
lilli,TO YOUR MODERN IDEAS I COMPARE ONE DERRIERE!
cardinal's secretary,The Cardinal is right this way.
cardinal's secretary," Your Eminence, Signor Contini is here."
cardinal,I like Charlie Chaplin.
guido,Me too.
cardinal,A genius. What can I do for you?
guido,Do you believe in God?
cardinal's secretary,"Signor Contini, please."
cardinal,"No, no, it's an honest question.    Yes, I believe in God. p. 42"
guido,So do I.
cardinal,Are you a Catholic?
guido,"Oh yes, very much so. Not as much as I would like to be, not as much as you would like me to be, I'm sure, but certainly yes, I'm trying."
cardinal,Try harder.
guido,"Yes, yes. I will, I will. Your Eminence, I am not happy. I'm searching for something. I feel a sense of misery, of despair and --"
cardinal," I saw your films. Not the flops, the others, the good ones. But you think people need to see so much sex?   It's not necessary. We can all imagine."
guido, Excuse me - my films are what I imagine.
cardinal,Then your imagination has no moral training.
guido, How do you train the imagination?
cardinal,"The imagination is God's garden; don't let the Devil play in it. Teach our Italian women to be wives, not whores, don't make us look at filth and debauchery. Make us proud to be Italian..."
young guido, Saraghina.
boys,Saraghina!   Saraghina!
young guido, Saraghina! Sa-ra-ghina!
saraghina,"So, you little Italian devils, you want to know about love? Saraghina will tell you...and if you want to make a woman happy, you rely on what you were born with. Because it is in your blood."
saraghina," BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN. TAKE A CHANCE, AND TRY TO STEAL A FIERY KISS. BE ITALIAN, BE ITALIAN. WHEN YOU HOLD ME, DON'T JUST HOLD ME BUT HOLD THIS!"
saraghina,"PLEASE BE GENTLE, SENTIMENTAL, GO AHEAD AND TRY TO GIVE MY CHEEK A PAT, BUT BE DARING AND UNCARING. WHEN YOU PINCH ME, TRY TO PINCH ME WHERE THERE'S FAT."
mamma,"I am ashamed of you, Guido."
young guido,"But Mamma, what did I do."
principal,"Bring him here. That savage is the devil. God will punish you for your sins, now and forever."
carla,What? What?
guido,"I can't breathe, I can't breathe."
carla,"Guido, don't die on me! Can you imagine... poor Luigi! It would kill him."
guido, If I die it would kill your husband?
carla,"No, that's not what I meant, Guidino. No. Where are you going?"
guido,"I have to go to work. Carla, I can't breathe."
carla,Let me come with you.
guido,It's impossible.
carla,Why?
guido,Because it's impossible. Please.
carla,"But why is it impossible? Look at your producer! He's married, he brings his girlfriend to work and nobody cares. Guido. Everybody knows about me. Why? Why won't you let me near you?"
guido,For the very same reason you don't want me to die on top of you. It's not fair to your husband. It's not fair to my wife. p. 48
carla,"See, you're playing with me. You're twisting everything... Please let me come with you."
guido,No.
carla,I'll be here waiting for you with my legs open.
guido,"Let's say there were ten sequences, each one set in a different period, but played by the same cast, a man and a woman, a woman and a man...  Like the circus..."
dante,Claudia is going to be amazing.
benito,It sounds like a masterpiece.
fausto," Dante, you see, he hasn't written a word..."
dante, The screenplay is first of all a map. That's a map. p. 49
guido,"Let's try to dig for something else. Maybe a group of people digging, with shovels, in the desert."
lilli,Guido.
guido,Luisa!
luisa,The jungle drums said it was an emergency.
guido,The jungle drums exaggerated just a tiny bit.
luisa,Not entirely.  You haven't been sleeping.
guido,"I was dying, until just now.    Come."
luisa,Am I already going home?
guido,"I hope not. Happy Birthday, my darling. p. 50"
dante, Here she is. At last.   Magnificent. You know Donatella?
luisa,I do now.
lilli," You're saving the movie. Give him a good idea, for God's sake."
guido,Let's drink a toast to Luisa's birthday.
luisa, It was Monday.
dante,Happy Birthday!
luisa, Thank you.
guido,Happy Birthday.
cardinal's secretary,Maestro. p. 51
guido," Ah, Don Mario. Excuse me, darling, this is Don Mario. This is my wife, Luisa."
cardinal's secretary,"A pleasure, Signora."
luisa,"Sit down, won't you, Don Mario?"
cardinal's secretary,Oh no.
luisa,Please.
cardinal's secretary,"I was telling your husband how much I admire his movies. Publicly, you know the Church condemns them - we have to - but we all love them.  Last year we did our own version of your Il Vicolo at the Christmas Party."
lilli,That I would pay to see.
guido,Luisa was in that film.
lilli,She was the best thing in the movie.
guido,It's true.   It was your first part.
cardinal's secretary,Of course! - you're Luisa Acari! Oh my Lord!
luisa,I was.
cardinal's secretary,You can't stop being somebody.
luisa,Can't you? p. 52
cardinal's secretary,"Well there's a good catholic wife for you, Guido, that's what they do - sacrifice. Still, Signora Contini, it must be a very exciting life for you...  Luisa looks to Guido.   Close up on Guido."
luisa,"MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES TO MAKE THEM HE LIVES A KIND OF DREAM IN WHICH HIS ACTIONS AREN'T ALWAYS WHAT THEY SEEM- HE MAY BE ON TO SOME UNIQUE ROMANTIC THEME. SOME MEN RUN BANKS SOME RULE THE WORLD SOME EARN THEIR LIVING BAKING BREAD. MY HUSBAND.... HE GOES A LITTLE CRAZY MAKING MOVIES INSTEAD. MY HUSBAND SPINS FANTASIES, HE LIVES THEM, THEN GIVES THEM TO YOU ALL LIKE MICHELANGELO, HE PAINTS HIS PRIVATE DOME BUT CAN'T DISTINGUISH WHAT'S HIS WORK AND WHAT'S HIS HOME. SOME MEN SELL STOCKS SOME MEN PUNCH CLOCKS SOME LEAP WHERE OTHERS FEAR TO TREAD. MY HUSBAND, AS AUTHOR AND DIRECTOR, MAKES UP STORIES IN HIS HEAD."
luisa,My father's Italian. My mother's French.
luisa," Oh, I've waited..."
luisa,"Waited tables.  And, of course, I studied theatre and mime in Paris. But, mostly waited tables. p. 54"
guido,Thank you.
luisa,For what?
guido,Thank you. For what I'm looking at.  Keep running.
luisa,"LONG AGO - SOMEONE ELSE AGO. HOW HE NEEDS ME SO, AND HE'LL BE THE LAST TO KNOW IT. MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES. TO MAKE THEM HE MAKES HIMSELF OBSESSED. HE WORKS FOR WEEKS ON END WITHOUT A BIT OF REST- NO OTHER WAY CAN HE ACHIEVE HIS LEVEL BEST. SOME MEN READ BOOKS, SOME SHINE THEIR SHOES, SOME RETIRE EARLY, SOME STAY UP TO DREAM AND MUSE. MY HUSBAND ONLY RARELY COMES TO BED - MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES INSTEAD. MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES..."
luisa,"Excuse me, I suddenly feel very tired."
guido,Luisa!
luisa,I'm staggered by my own stupidity.    I could vomit.
guido,Luisa - will you please just tell me what happened?
luisa,You open your mouth and a lie comes out.
guido,What lie?
luisa,Why am I surprised? - it's like breathing to you.
carla,Guido.
carla, I was hungry. I'm tired of eating alone in that room.
guido,There are plenty of restaurants. p. 56
carla,I wanted to see the hotel. I told you I came here with my parents when I was little. I didn't come to disturb you.
guido,Well you certainly managed to.
carla,Why didn't you tell me Luisa was going to be here!
guido,I didn't know she was here.   She just turned up.
carla,"Well, she could have warned you."
guido,The only privilege my wife has these days is not having to warn me.
guido,"Carla, you have to wait outside."
carla,Will you wait with me?
guido,I'm in the middle of a working dinner with my colleagues.
carla,So why do I have to wait outside?
guido, I'll find someone to escort you home.
de rossi," Signora, would you rather wait inside?"
carla,I'm going to walk.   Please tell my friend I had to leave.
guido,Apparently she's staying in some grotesque pensione next to the station.
luisa, Very plausible.
guido,Because it's true.
luisa,You told me it was finished.
guido,"It is. Look, she was worried about me, she came to see if I was all right - which yes, is stupid but not, as far as I know, a crime, and hardly a mortal sin."
luisa,"Nothing. If you could see yourself.  I couldn't live with it - the absurdity of being you, the effort of having to hide and lie and cheat. It's exhausting, no wonder you've got no script, you're too busy inventing your own life."
guido,"It's finished. It's finished.  If it wasn't before, it is now."
luisa, Blah blah blah blah blah.
guido,Vodka.
guido,"Yes, I remember very well, Stephanina from Vogue."
stephanie,"So, coincidence. You being here.    And me being here. p. 59"
guido, Amazing. May I take a cigarette?
stephanie,That was quite a performance. At the Press Conference. The Vanishing Act.
guido, Please.
stephanie,Grazie.
guido,Prego.
stephanie, I've seen all your movies.
guido, Really?
stephanie,Like a million times. They're the only movies that tell the truth about the modern world.
guido,And what truth is that?
stephanie, Death of religion... Sexual revolution...
guido,I don't think religion is dead. And what exactly is the sexual revolution?
stephanie,That we can talk about later.
guido, Style.
stephanie,Every frame is like a postcard.
guido, Okay.
stephanie,It's great: you care as much about the suit as the man wearing it.
guido,I hate that man.
stephanie,No! Style is the new content! It's what my readers love. They want to dress like Claudia Jenssen. They want to undress like Claudia Jenssen. They want to ride on a Vespa down the Via Veneto. They want to live in an Italian movie.
stephanie,I LOVE THE BLACK AND WHITE! I LOVE THE PLAY OF LIGHT! THE WAY CONTINI PUTS HIS IMAGE THROUGH A PRISM.
stephanie,I FEEL MY BODY CHILL GIVES ME A SPECIAL THRILL EACH TIME I SEE THAT GUIDO NEO-REALISM
stephanie,"I LOVE THE DARK AND HANDSOME GUYS WITH THEIR SKINNY LITTLE TIES DRESSIN' MOD, LOOKIN' OUTTA SIGHT! I LOVE TO WATCH `EM AS THEY CRUISE WITH THEIR POINTY LEATHER SHOES WEARIN' SHADES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT."
stephanie,"WHATEVER GUIDO DOES, IT MAKES ME SMILE HE IS THE ESSENCE OF ITALIAN STYLE. I LOVE THE GLAMOROUSLY LATIN WORLD THAT ONLY GUIDO CAN PORTRAY!!!"
stephanie,"THOSE SCENES I LOVE TO SEE FROM GUIDO'S ""P"" ""O"" ""V"" THERE'S NO ONE ELSE WITH HIS UNIQUE DIRECTOR'S VISION. HIS ANGLES - WIDE AND TIGHT - EACH MOMENT FEELS SO RIGHT... DEFINES ITALIAN STYLE BY ONLY HIS DECISION! I LOVE THE SPEEDY LITTLE CARS THE HIP COFFEE BARS THE SLEEK WOMEN IN POSITANO... GUIDO'S THE ULTIMATE UOMO ROMANO!"
stephanie,DARK AND HANDSOME GUYS SKINNY LITTLE TIES SHADES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT SPEEDY LITTLE CARS HIP COFFEE BARS SLEEK WOMEN IN POSITANO...
all,NELLA MIA ANIMA NELLA MIA ANIMA CINEMA ITALIANO
stephanie,CINEMA ITALIANO

contini's cinema,ITALIANO!
guido,No.
guido,I love you Luisa.
guido,Is the doctor still with her?
matron,"Yes, he's in there. He's waiting for you. This way. p. 65"
carla, You came.
guido, I'm here.
doctor rondi,Signor Contini.
carla,Come back.
doctor rondi,"She took five or six pills, enough to make herself very sick. I understand she's your mistress.  This is a sordid business. You movie people, I suppose you don't consider yourself bound by morality..."
guido,Thank you.    I'm going to stay with her now.
matron,"If you need us for anything, just call, okay? Francesca, andiamo."
guido,Grazie.
carla,"No, he'll take me home."
guido,"What have you done to yourself?    I'm not worth dying for, Carla."
carla,"Don't be angry with me. Everything I do, I just want you to love me."
guido,Ssshh. You should rest. We'll talk about everything in the morning...
carla, Don't leave me. Don't leave me.
guido,"Rest, rest.   Cara mia..."
carla,"My husband thinks I'm clever, that's the strange thing, because I'm not, well you know that, I spend too much time in my little brain thinking about you, about where you are, what you are doing, what you dream of."
mamma,"OH, DREAM OF YOUR YOUTH WHEN I'M STILL BY YOUR SIDE DREAM OF YOUR MANHOOD, PRAY I'M THERE TO GUIDE YOU AND WHEN YOU GROW OLD  p. 68"
guido,"Hold on to me, Mamma.   Don't let me wake from this."
matron,Excuse me.
luigi,Is she okay?
guido,Yes.
luigi,I'd like to take her home.
guido,"Of course. I'm sorry.  She loves you, you know that, don't you."
luigi,She's my wife.
guido,Darling?
dante,We're going back to Rome.
guido, Where's Luisa?
dante,Luisa? She's gone. She's had it with you.  p. 70
guido, I can't.
dante,You can't. You must. Don't sit down.
guido,I need help.
dante," You've had help. You've seen the doctors, you've seen the priests, you've taken the cure."
guido,I'm not cured.
dante," That's enough! The movie calls, your star has landed. Fausto - take his things please."
pierpaolo,"Maestro, the screen tests are back from the lab. Will you watch them now?"
dante,Tonight.   We'll watch everything tonight and make some decisions.
pierpaolo,Design meeting? Production meeting?
dante,Tonight.
pierpaolo,Tonight.
lilli,Claudia says where are you? She's in fine form. Feisty.
guido, Okay.
lilli,She asked if she could read my script as she didn't have one. I said I didn't quite have mine.
luisa,Pronto.
guido,"Luisa, it's me. Please don't hang up.  I want you to be with me in the screening room tonight. I want to talk to you about the casting, about the script. Everything..."
guido,"Otherwise I won't be able to start, I won't know what I'm thinking..."
pierpaolo,Maestro.
guido,Are you there? Luisa?
luisa,Go on.
guido,"I'm not asking you to let me come home, I just want you to come to the screen test tonight. Not for me, but for the movie. You always have, you always do."
pierpaolo,Silence please. Se gira. And we are rolling.
guido,"Could you turn to the right please, Claudia."
claudia,"Yes, I can turn to my right."
guido,And can you turn to the left.
claudia,"Yes, I can turn to my left."
guido,Now just one slow turn for us.
claudia," Okay, one slow turn."
guido,Bellissima.   Brava.   Cut.
pierpaolo,We've got it. Next costume please.
claudia,"Has anybody got a script? Script missing, handsome reward.... Lost, one script, title Italia. Can't make a film without it..."
pierpaolo," But please, just a couple more costumes, Claudia."
claudia, Ciao Bello.
guido,That's fair.
dante,Claudia!
guido, That's fair.
dante,Fair?
guido,I'll be back. p. 75
dante," You've got dailies, Guido."
guido,I'll be right back.
dante, You've got meetings.
guido,You look ravishing.
claudia,"You're not seeing me, you're seeing Lilli's wigs and makeup, I'm somewhere hidden underneath."
guido,It's good to see you.
claudia,I'm assuming that's code for there's no script.
guido,Why is everybody so suddenly obsessed with the script?
claudia,So Lilli says I'm playing a million different parts -
guido,"Not a million - you're the muses, the incredible women who made Italy what it is today, a country run by men - who are themselves run by women, whether they know it or not."
claudia, So I'm the women behind the great men?
guido, p. 77
claudia, And these muses - they fall in love with the man?
guido,Exactly!   They fall in love with him.
claudia, I'd rather be the man.
guido,What?
claudia,I'd rather be the man.
claudia,"IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, ONE TIME I NEEDED YOU, IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, YOU WERE MY FRIEND. MAYBE IT LASTED A DAY, MAYBE IT LASTED AN HOUR, BUT SOMEHOW IT WILL NEVER END."
claudia,These women who come off their pedestals for a kiss - they're just fantasies.
guido,"No, you misunderstand... p. 78"
claudia,"IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, I THINK I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU, IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, I WANT TO CRY. SOMETHING INSIDE ME GOES WEAK, SOMETHING INSIDE ME SURRENDERS, AND YOU'RE THE REASON WHY, YOU'RE THE REASON WHY. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO TO ME. YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE. YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME LOOKING AT YOU. IT SCARES ME SO THAT I CAN HARDLY SPEAK."
guido,She's his inspiration.
claudia,I can't keep playing that part.
guido,I fall in love with you every time.
claudia,When there's a camera between us.
guido,No.
claudia,"It's not a real person, Guido.  And this man you describe - he doesn't know how to love."
guido,"There was a time once, we were on location, some terrible hotel - and you were in the room directly above me and I could hear you walking about..."
claudia,And why didn't you?
guido,I don't know. I don't know.
claudia,"SPECIAL TO ME IN MY LIFE, SINCE THE FIRST DAY THAT I MET YOU. HOW COULD I EVER FORGET YOU, ONCE YOU HAD TOUCHED MY SOUL. IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY, YOU'VE MADE ME WHOLE."
claudia,"Maybe you should have knocked, maybe you should have knocked me right off the pedestal. I can't do this anymore."
dante," Great work, Lilli... Wonderful costume..."
lilli,Thank you.
dante,"...and the hair, makeup, fantastic."
benito,She has a beautiful profile.
dante,Two great profiles.
fausto,She's a goddess.
dante,And the back isn't too bad.
fausto,She came directly from Venus. Beautiful.
dante,Fantastic. Guido?     Really nice. Who's next?
benito,Actresses.
dante,Okay.   Let's see the actresses.
benito,"If we like her, we have to call her agent right away. Everybody wants her right now."
dante,Well they can keep her.
benito,She's a very funny actress.
dante,She's peculiar. You don't like her Guido?
fausto,She's very natural.
dante,"Even better. She's a bit nervous here. What do you say, Guido? Donatella's nice?"
fausto,She's too tall.
dante,Very tall.
benito,She's very beautiful.
dante,It's not the point.     Guido wants the blonde.
fausto,"She's not bad, but -"
dante,Shh.
fausto,She's beautiful.
dante,She's too beautiful.      For my tastes.
guido,Sure.
dante," Great. Anyway, fantastic day, but we have to go home. We have a very, very busy day tomorrow. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Okay, well done."
guido,It meant so much to us all.    That you came.  p. 83
luisa,YOU WANT MY LOVE? TAKE IT ALL YOU WANT TO WATCH IT ALL COME OFF? TAKE IT ALL COME ON NOW SHOW ME HOW YOU TAKE IT ALL...
luisa,Thank you.
guido, What for?
luisa,"Thank you for reminding me I'm not special. You don't even see what you do, do you? Even the moments I think are ours, it's just you working to get what you want."
luisa,YOU WANT MY GLOVE? ARE YOU ENTHRALLED? YOU WANT TO SEE IT SLIP AWAY AND WATCH IT FALL? OH WE KNOW IT'S YOUR SHOW SO TAKE IT ALL
guido, What are you talking about?
luisa,"And this is our life. You think to create is to forgive yourself in public. Fine. But don't think I can forgive you in private, because I can't ever."
luisa,SO GO AHEAD TAKE IT ALL
luisa,"You're just an appetite, and if you stopped being greedy you'd die. You take everything, and I'm empty."
guido,"What have I done? What have I done, Luisa?"
guido,"I CAN'T   MAKE THIS MOVIE, THERE'S   NO WAY THAT I'LL BEGIN IT. I CAN'T   BEAR TO SEE THE CAMERAS ROLL. PROBLEM   IS THE SUBJECT, THERE'S   NO PLEASANT WAY TO TREAT IT.  p. 86"
mamma,"No one can help you find your way.  It's up to you, Guido. Up to you. Nobody else.  In Guido's face, a soulful recognition that what she's said is true."
guido,There is no movie. I can't pretend anymore. We have to stop.  I'm sorry.
lilli,I'm glad she's acting again. I made her costumes for the play. She's funny.
guido,She seemed so happy. I didn't want to interfere... Is she with anybody?
lilli,"Guido, she's my friend. I'm not her mother. I don't know. I expect so. Nobody likes to be alone. Promise me you're going to let me cut your hair and get rid of that awful beard. p. 89"
guido,I like to get about without everybody pointing at me.
lilli,And where are you getting about?
guido,Nowhere. Here. I walk. Just to be able to walk.
lilli,Are you seeing anybody?
guido,"No, no. Nobody."
lilli," Well, it sounds exciting. Walking around and not seeing anyone, growing a beard.   I might come up here and join you."
guido,"Don't tease me, Lilli.    My heart is -"
lilli,- I know.
guido,I just miss her. I should have IDIOT tattooed on my forehead.
lilli,Luisa certainly thinks so.
guido, Does she? Did she really say that?
lilli,Stop! I'm not going to act as a postman between you both. Come back to Rome. Make a movie. Go to work.
guido,"No. Never. I've spent this time trying to learn something, Lilli, to not be the person who forgets about everybody else, the person who never grew up. p. 90"
lilli,"You're such a dope, aren't you? Making movies wasn't your problem. You were your problem.   Don't stop being a child. You'll never make another movie! Nobody wants that... especially Luisa."
guido, The only movie I could make now would be... I don't know... would be about a man trying to win back his wife.
lilli,Sounds perfect.  The costumes might not be so bad too.
young guido,We're ready to begin!
guido,I can't remember how you do this.
pierpaolo,You'll remember.
guido,I don't want to say too much. The first way that we kill our film is by talking about it. But this scene is about reconciliation. And within the scene I would like you to try and find your way to begin that journey back towards each other.
young guido,Presto! Presto! Take your places! Andiamo! Andiamo!
guido," Maybe it's the most important building block that we have to begin again... We start from the beginning each time and I feel today as if I'm starting from the beginning. We'll just keep asking each other questions, and don't look to me for the answers, okay?"
pierpaolo,"Maestro, should I call final checks?"
guido,Yes.
pierpaolo,"Makeup, please! Final checks!"
clapper loader,Slate.
guido,ACTION.
