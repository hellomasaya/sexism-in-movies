burch, ...I'm out of time...
burch,...man to man.
scott,"The door's closed, Sir."
burch,I. Need. To Ask You. To do something. 
scott,"I am here to get the girl back.  Burch thinks a moment, he rubs his face, and shakes his head, and looks up as if to say ""This is all we have, this is the best we have"". Pause. He nods, as they do not move.  Burch takes out a photo of a bearded middle-eastern looking man in a business suit, and another, in a mugshot marked ""Lewisberg Federal Penitentiary"". "
burch,"This man...Placed a phonecall. Yesterday. From the phonebank at Lewisberg. To the Copley Payphone.  ...here it is: This man, Eli Assani, is to be transported, tomorrow, Wednesday, with another convict. A Man on Death Row. For their medical procedures...Now:  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY.  A Police Cruiser coming quickly down a two-lane, deserted road.  ANGLE INT. THE CRUISER. A road sign reads ""Just Two Miles To 'The Owl', Rest Stop, Restaurant, Gas-Diesel"".  ANGLE EXT. THE OWL. Rest Stop. A run-down rural gas station, restaurant. Off to the side we see the cruiser coming down the road. As a roughly-dressed man runs out of the restaurant, carrying a full paper bag in his hand. The Cruiser, unseen by the man, pulls up to the gas pump, and the Trooper starts to get out of the driver's seat. When gunfire erupts from the restaurant. People are shooting at the fleeing man. A man opens the door of the restaurant and fires at the roughly-dressed man in a very urban leather jacket, who returns fire. Glass breaks in the windows of the restaurant.  The roughly-dressed man runs to his car, an 80's Pontiac, parked near the pumps. The man in the doorway fires again, and the windshield of the Pontiac blows out and a tire bursts. The roughly-dressed man returns fire, and the man in the doorway falls. The roughly-dressed man turns to see that the Trooper is out of his Cruiser, and is about to fire at him. The roughly-dressed man drops his satchel, and fires at the Trooper, who falls.  The paper bag has fallen to the ground and burst, and currency is spilling out of it, and being taken on the wind. The roughly-dressed man frantically begins to try to scoop it up and into his jacket.  ANGLE CU on this man, who we now see is SCOTT. He stands around, and moves to the fallen Trooper. He strips the keys from the Trooper's keyring, and looks up. Feeling someone gazing at him.  ANGLE HIS POV. In the car, two convicts, a Heavyset Man and ELI ASSANI, the middle-eastern man we saw in the mugshot. He is holding his neck, which is bleeding copiously. "
scott,Shut up.
heavyset convict,"Yeah, two twelve sierra took all the 20 he's gonna take...Oh, man, you left him there..."
heavyset convict,"Yeah, he done ate from the tree of knowledge, our Sierra Two Twelve."
assani,...help me...
scott,Shut up.
scott,...drag him out...  ...got some business to do...

heavyset convict,"...yeah, I heard yah..."
heavyset convict,"Yeah, Baby. Pass some my way..."
scott,"Sorry, my man...traveling light..."
assani,"Don't shoot me, don't shoot me, I have what you want. I HAVE WHAT YOU WANT. I CAN GET US OUT OF THE COUNTRY TONIGHT. TONIGHT. NO PASSPORT. FLY OUT. TONIGHT...OH GOD, DON'T SHOOT ME! I SWEAR ON MY MOTHER. LOOK AT ME: AM I LYING TO YOU? A SEA PLANE. TONIGHT. HELP ME. I SWEAR TO YOU."
scott,Why in the world would I believe a lying convict like you...
assani,"Oh, ah, ah, but you do believe me...I see it...you do. I can get us out. Help me. I SWEAR TO YOU. HELP ME...and I will treat you like a brother...I..."
scott,"My brother used to beat me  Nice guess, though."
assani,OH GOD NO!
assani,"No, no. Listen to me...listen...make one call. One call - go in the house. Make One Call. ONE CALL. An Aviation Company. Tell...tell them...tell them the word I say, and they will say: THE PLANE WILL MEET YOU AT...  Yes. Yes..."
scott,You a fag my friend?
assani,No.  I am not.
scott,Then why the hell you looking at me?
assani,"I was thinking...how fucking surprised you're going to be.  Because, Baby, you just did that fucken good turn, going to Make You Rich, Fat, and Happy..."
scott,...just get me on that plane.
assani,Didn't they tell you...?
scott,All I heard's a voice on the phone...

scott,"Better question, where you've been so long, do you like girls?"
assani,We have. You will have...the most beautiful...
scott,"...most beautiful women, eh?"
assani,"Not women, Baby. Girls. You got to trust me, I'm the Doctor here...All young. All blonde..."
scott,And this all takes place Where...?
assani,In Dubai. In Yemen...
scott,"Well, that's a long way from Tiperrary, pal..."
assani,...what do you have here...?
scott,"Yeah, but I'm not cut out, to live in a fucken tent. "
assani,"If you think you can imagine luxury...I am here to tell you, my friend...  "
scott,"Well, may it Just Be So..."
assani,When we get to Maskala...
scott,"And, now, what's Maskala...?"
assani,"...when we get to Dubai, better..."
scott,What's Maskala...?
assani,"...that's where we clean them up. We ship them Rough, we make them Smooth, and everybody's happy."
scott,"Well, then, you're a philosopher...huh...? How 'bout making me happy tonight..."
assani,"If there's a girl, in the pipeline, tonight, you shall have her, what do you say to that?"
scott,...I say you're a stone cold whoremaster...
assani,"No, no baby. Take it to the    bank. The Arabs, Man. All the oil    - all the money in the world.    What can't they have? Booze and    Pussy. How do they get it...?"
scott,You the candy man? Is that it?

man,"...after, after he'd finished driving him..."
scott,...him...?
burly man, I said...
burly man,"Yeah. It's a man's world, pal - but you're in the wrong bar.  He turns Scott around, and pushes Scott deeper into the room, away from the other man, who is now going out of the door. Scott moves toward him and the Burly Man tries to stop him. "

avi,"I hope not.  Between fifteen and twenty-five, they all look alike."
scott, Is that your experience...?
avi,"Yes. It is. Nonetheless, we tried to match it to a Current Photo..."
avi,...she was there twelve hours ago.
scott,Who took the photo?
scott,What does the bonus cost?
avi," Any of these, in particular...would you say Hello to them?"
scott,"Who else have you done a favor for, Avi?"
avi,Bobby: the world runs on manners.
