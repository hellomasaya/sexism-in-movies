Speaker,Dialogue
harvey,Put my score up first.
johnnie,"They don't want to hear it, Harvey."
harvey,"I know, but I want to hear it. Put it up."
johnnie,"I'm backed up already, Harvey."
harvey," Johnnie, you were the one that was late. Just put it up."
johnnie,"Listen, Harvey. Marvin wants me to present my ideas while your away."
harvey,Huh?
johnnie,"Look, I'm not doing myself any favours here, Harvey. But, I'd watch your back."
harvey,"Marvin? Hey, Marvin?"
marvin,"Hey, Harvey. Shouldn't you be in London?"
harvey,"Yeah, I'm heading there now. What's going on?"
marvin,Huh?
harvey,Johnnie said something about you wanting him to present on Monday.
marvin,"Oh yeah, No, I was just thinking that, what with you being in London - you should stay a while."
harvey,What?
marvin,There's no need to rush back. Enjoy your daughter's wedding.
harvey,What?
marvin,"Well, Johnnie can do it. I mean, he can pitch the Samuelson account."
harvey,"No, I'm coming back. Those are my connections. They have been for years."
marvin,I know but... they've got new people running things over there. I think they're after something...  ...different.
harvey,I want to come back. I should be there in person.
marvin,"`There in person'? Harvey, nobody cares."
harvey,I have to stand behind my music!
marvin,"They're demos! - They're already pressed. No one needs to be there. They're not looking for you, they're not looking for me. They just need a fucking track.  Harvey, you haven't booked a top line in 8 months."
harvey,You got me doing triangle chimes for Christ's sake - give me something to compose!
marvin,That's what I'm trying to tell you! It's not about composition! It's different now!
harvey,"I'm back on Monday, Marvin. I'm coming back."
marvin," You got to land this one, Harvey."
harvey,What are you saying?  Say it!
marvin,"I'm saying there are no more chances, Harvey.  Enjoy London."
harvey,Shit!
stewardess,I'll get you some napkins.
harvey, Why's it always me?
stewardess,Shall I take that?
harvey,Thanks... And could I get another?
stewardess,"A whiskey, wasn't it?"
harvey,"Yes. `Jamesons', no ice."
woman,No. Business.
harvey,My daughter's getting married.
woman,Congratulations.
woman,I'm really sorry but I have a meeting in the morning and I must try and get some sleep.
harvey,No... Of course. I'm sorry.
woman,"It's just, I'll be useless - unless I get some sleep."
harvey,Sure.
postman,Morning Kate. Looking lovely as ever. If I was younger...
kate,Careful Paddy.  Blushing! Is she up?
postman,Oh yes.
kate, Mum. It's me - your daughter.
maggie,"Hello, my daughter."
kate,"I can't, I'm running late."
maggie,He's at it again.
kate, Who? At what?
maggie,The neighbour. Barbecuing or something.
kate," You know, you don't have to keep taking these - the Doctor said."
maggie,I like to. It makes me feel better.  Its 8 o'clock in the morning. Who barbecues at 8?
kate, I've got to go. I'll call you later.
maggie,Of course. Don't worry about me. I'll be Ok.  Have you got that date thing tonight?
kate,"I don't know, maybe.  Bye Mum."
maggie,"`Time and tide', Kate, as your father liked to say."
kate,Was that from his terrace in the South of France?
kate,Aggie.
aggie,Morning darling.
aggie,Four across. A filmy layer on the surface of a liquid?
kate,Scum.
oonagh,Sorry. Sorry.
kate,No.
oonagh,Please.
kate,Only if you guys swear you won't leave if it's not going well.
oonagh,No way.
kate,Promise?
oonagh,Promise.
aggie,Seven down. Another word for `souvenir'?
kate,Memento.
oonagh,"Aggie, why do you bother? You just get Kate to give you all the answers."
kate,So you spent the whole 2 weeks in the Toronto area?
elderly man,"Yes. Our daughter lives there, see."
kate,Ah.  So not a business trip then?
elderly man,"Oh, no. Unless you count grand- children as work."
kate, Some might.
kate,"Sorry, I couldn't just ask you a few very quick questions, could I?"
harvey,"I'm sorry, but I'm in a bit of a hurry."
kate,It won't take a moment.
harvey," Look, I'm sorry, but I'm tired, you know?"
kate,Yes. I do.
harvey,I'm sorry.
harvey,"Hi Suzie, it's your Dad. I've made it in one piece. I'm in a Taxi on my way to the Hotel. I guess i'll see you all there. Can't wait. Love you."
harvey,Hi. I'm with the wedding party. There should be a room for me. Harvey Shine.
concierge,Yes. I have a double room for you.
harvey,Good. Has everyone else checked in?
concierge,"I'm not sure, sir."
harvey,My daughter. Susan Shine. Or maybe she's already going by Wright. Susan Wright.
concierge,"No, sir. No one of that name."
harvey,Do you have a Mrs Pearce?
concierge,"No, sir."
harvey,I'll go up.
harvey,"Hello?  Oh...I see. No, I didn't realise. I thought the plan was for everyone to stay together."
kate,Mum?
maggie,What are you wearing?
kate,Dungarees.
maggie,"Oh, you're not!"
kate,"They're completely in again, haven't you heard?"
maggie," Oh, you're just being silly."
kate," Ok, mum. Thanks for the advice."
maggie,"Oh, listen. I've been thinking about Greece for our holiday."
kate, I love you too.
kate,Sorry i'm late.
oonagh,Don't tell me...  ...your mother?
kate,She's worrying about her new neighbour. Says he barbecues a lot.
oonagh,Very suspicious.
kate, I know.
oonagh,I got you the same as me.  They're at the bar. He seems very nice.
matt,Hey Kate.
kate,Hi Matt.
matt,"Kate, this is Simon."
simon,Hi.
kate,Hi.  You work with Matt?
simon,Yes. If you can call it work.
kate, Right.
oonagh,"Come on, i'm feeling small down here. Sit!"
harvey,Just over by the bed. Thank you. Hello?
harvey,Careful!
harvey,Are you sure? Here.
scott,Harvey.
harvey,Scott.
scott,You made it.
harvey,Yes.
scott,"This is Susan's father, Harvey. Harvey Shine.  Harvey, this is my best man, Josh Stillman and Pete Turner."
harvey,Hi.
friends,Hi.
scott,How are you Harvey?  Its great to see you.
harvey,Good thanks. Great.  How are you holding up?
scott,"Great.  Can't wait to marry your daughter, really."
harvey,No...  Is she..?
scott,She's through there. She'll be thrilled you're here. I'll go and find her.
harvey,Sorry.
josh,"Sure.  What's your field, Harvey?"
harvey,"Oh, I'm a...  I work in the music industry."
josh,Wow. Doing what?
harvey,I'm a composer.  Sort of.
pete,Cool. What kind of stuff?
harvey,"Oh, you know, for...commercials, that sort of thing. TV.  Mostly background stuff, that sort of thing."
josh,I see.
pete,Sounds profitable.
harvey,It can be.  You guys work with Scott?
harvey,"Oil, right?"
josh,"Futures, yes."
harvey,"Well, I'm sure that's pretty profitable too."
josh,"Sometimes, yes."
harvey,"Well, I'd better find my daughter."
pete,"Absolutely. Good to meet you, Harvey. See you in there."
oonagh,So?
kate,He seems nice.
oonagh,Nice? Nice like good. Or nice like dull.
kate,Nice like how old is he?
oonagh,Old enough. Your age...ish.
kate,"He can't be, he's looks like a baby."
oonagh,"Alright, my age. But Matt says he's very mature."
kate,Oh right. Did Matt offer that up - or was that in response to you two discussing my approaching barrenness.
oonagh,Kate?
kate,I have to. She's on her own.  She gets lonely.
oonagh,Just tell her you're busy.
kate,Mum?
susan,Hi Dad.
harvey,Suz...  You look beautiful.
susan,Thank you.
harvey,"Give us a hug then, as they say in this country."
susan,No. You look...
harvey,Like a bad lounge act.
susan,Dad.
harvey,Long way to come to see two American kids get married.
susan,"Sorry for the inconvenience, Dad."
harvey,Sorry.
susan,Have you seen mum yet?
harvey,No. They're here?
susan,Yes. They're over by our table.
harvey,What?  I'll be good.
scott,Look who i've got!
harvey,I'll speak to you later Suz. You enjoy your friends.
kate,Yes. Half-day.
oonagh,I'll see you Tuesday.
simon,Looks like we've been set up.
kate,Yes.  Sorry.
simon,"No. It's not your fault. I mean, I'm fine with it. I mean, I'm happy to meet new people."
kate,"Yes, me too."
simon,Why don't you sit down?
kate,Yes.
simon,So you're Oonagh's boss?
kate,"Yes.  Sorry, I'm saying `yes' a lot."
simon,Yes.  You are.
kate,Ye...  Sure. I can get them.
simon,"No, it's fine. What do you fancy?"
kate,I'll have another white wine. Anything dry.
jean,Harvey.
harvey,Jean.
brian,Harvey. Good to see you.
harvey, So our baby girl is really getting married. Who would've thought?
jean,Yes.
brian,Harvey you remember the Watsons. Barry and Jill.
harvey," Of course I do. Hell, its been a while. I guess, not since Jean and I split up."
jill,Hi Harvey. You look well.
harvey,"Thank you, Jill. You're looking well too. Both of you. I guess you guys stayed in touch with Jean."
brian,Barry and I work together now.
harvey,No kidding? Insurance?
barry,"No.  Property, now. A small portfolio down in Florida."
harvey,Real Estate. That's great.  That's really great.
brian,Well I think we should sit. I know Susan wanted us all seated before they joined us.
harvey,Sure. Good idea.
kate,Mum. You've got to stop calling.  What? I can't hear. Hold on.
harvey," Have you told him its Harvey? Look, we go back! He'll tell you. Just have him call me."
harvey,Sorry...
jean,"No, Harvey. I didn't touch it."
susan,Dad. I moved you. I thought it might be easier in case you needed to get out.
harvey,"Ok, sweetheart."
brian,"Shall we have a quick toast to get things going?  Dear Susan and Dear Scott, I just want to take us all back to that wonderful holiday we all had in Rome together last year and wish you `Salute'!"
everyone,Salute!
brian,"Jean and I love you both so much. And we're so happy that Scott is going to part of our clan now. And so I say many, many, happy, happy years ahead. Salute!"
everyone,Salute!
harvey,My turn?
everyone,Cheers.
susan,Let's eat.
everyone,Yes...
kate,Hi.
simon,Hey. Kate.  Everyone this is Kate.
kate,Hi.
simon,"Kate this is Andrew, Melissa, Gwen, and Elinor."
everyone,Hi.
melissa,"Sorry, I hope we're not barging in on your evening."
kate,We don't really. We just met.
melissa,A blind date?
simon,No.  We met through friends.
melissa,I see. I think we should leave you guys alone.
kate, Don't. Stay. It's fine.
andrew,Hey does anyone know the cricket score?
simon,"England were all out by tea, when I last checked."
andrew,Bloody hell.
gwen,Cricket. Don't get it.
melissa,"What? Men in white. Oh, I do."
gwen,"I heard that they did it in her bedroom, while she was away."
simon,It was her flat?
gwen,"Yep. He has his own, but was basically living at hers."
andrew,Ouch.
melissa,That is evil.
jean,Harvey.
harvey,Hello Jean.
jean, Can I get a glass of water please?
harvey, Fine.
jean,Go easy Harvey.
harvey," Why, Jean? Are you worried i'm going to embarrass you again?"
jean,"No Harvey, I'm worried you're going to embarrass yourself.  And more importantly Susan. This weekend's just about her and Scott. Nothing else."
harvey,"Oh, you're good Jean. You're really good. You've always known how to make me feel shit, haven't you?  You've always been so good at that."
jean,I've had cause to practice.
harvey,"Tell me, Jean. Were you ever proud of me?"
jean,Yes. Sometimes.  But you never listened.
harvey,"The parties Jean. The fuckin' parties, where I would hear you - dressing up what I did for a living - film composer this, film composer that - trying to make it more palatable for your friends. I'm a..."
jean, Don't Harvey.
harvey,What is it you see in Brian?
jean,He doesn't talk about himself.  He talks about me.
susan,Hi Dad.
harvey,Hey Suz.
susan,Are you alright?
harvey, Yeah. I'm great. How are you doing? Enjoying yourself?
susan,Yeah.
harvey,"He seems a good guy, Scott. You'll be alright."
susan,"Yeah, he is.  I'm sorry, I haven't had much time to talk to you."
harvey,"No Sweetheart, it's your weekend. It's no problem. You just enjoy yourself."
susan,How's work?
harvey,"Great.  Well, not great, but...fine. You know the usual. Triangle chimes."
susan,Are you still doing your own stuff? You should.
harvey,A bit... Not so much.
susan,Sure.
harvey,"It just can't be helped. But I'll be there at the ceremony, at the really important bit. I'll be there to give you away.  And then I'm sure Brian or your mother will talk at the reception. You know me, I've never been very good at speech..."
susan, Dad.
harvey,"Yeah, Suz?"
susan,"Listen, I've been thinking. "
harvey,But Suz...
susan,"Dad, I've hardly seen you in the past five years."
harvey,That's not true.
susan,"Dad, it is. Maybe a quick coffee here, or a telephone call there but no, you haven't been part of my life. And...  And Brian has."
harvey," Sorry. Look, I..."
susan," I'm sorry Dad, but it's what I've decided."
harvey,"Sure.  I understand, Suz."
harvey,You fuckin' asshole!
kate,Sorry.
harvey,Hello?
taxi driver,It's going to be bad everywhere. Your president's in town. It's causing chaos.
kate,Mum?
harvey,"I'm sorry but, I'm on the 4.30 to JFK."
waiting passenger,"Hey pal, we're all in hurry."
harvey,"Just hand luggage, can i go straight to the gate?"
steward,"Sir, I'm dealing with a passenger, you'll have to wait."
harvey,Please. I've gotta make that flight.
steward,"Sir, everyone is in a hurry. You'll just have to wait."
harvey,"Miss, i'm on the 4.30 to JFK. Can you check me in?"
harvey,But it's not yet 4! I just have hand luggage. It doesn't take off for another 40 minutes.
harvey,But I just have hand luggage. Please. I've got to get on that flight.
harvey,When's the next flight?
harvey, Jesus!
harvey,"Marvin. It's Harvey. Listen, there's been a mess up, the traffic was crazy. I'm going to have to reschedule the pitch slightly. Frank can set up. I'll email him the cue numbers - he knows what to do. And then I'll be there lunch- time at the latest. I'll come straight from the airport. I'll try you again shortly."
marvin,I got your message.
harvey,The traffic was insane. But listen...
marvin," The traffic, Harvey? Jesus!"
harvey,"It's fine, I'll be there lunch- time. It's no problem. Steve knows what I need. Mike's coming in. It's all set u..."
marvin, Harvey!
harvey,"Letting me go? Can't afford the space? Marvin, I'll be there lunch- time."
marvin,I'm sorry Harvey.  Call me when you get back.
harvey,"Jamesons, no ice."
bar man,Sorry.
harvey,Shit!
kate,For what?
harvey,For yesterday. I was rude. You tried to ask me some questions.
kate,"I don't really remember, but I'm sure you were. Most people are."
harvey,Good book?
kate,"It probably would be, if i could finish it."
harvey, I get it.
kate,That'll help.
harvey, Sorry?
kate,"I said, that'll help."
harvey,"Believe me, it will."
kate,Right.
harvey,I reckon it'll help as much as that trashy novel and a glass of chardonnay.
kate,O-kay.
harvey,I'm really sorry. That was out of line.
kate, What? Go away and stop apologizing.
harvey,It's just that i've had a really shitty day.
kate, Join the club.
harvey,"No. I mean really shitty. Yours may have been shitty, but mine was shittier."
kate,How shitty?
harvey,I missed my flight. I lost my job. And my daughter who got married in London today asked her step father rather than me to give her away.
kate,"Not bad.  Make it worse, maybe?"
harvey,Let me make it up to you.  Would you let me buy you lunch. What time is it - tea time? I'll buy you tea.
kate,"That's very sweet of you, but... I don't know you. And... you don't know me."
harvey,Exactly. That's why we should have lunch - tea.
kate,"Thank you, but...no."
harvey,Because you've got your book. And it's a good replacement for humans.
kate,No.
harvey,Should I take that as a hopeful sign.
kate,"If it is, you could just give me a little wider smile."
harvey,Look we are having lunch together.
kate, No. We're having lunch next to each other.
harvey,Ah.  I'm Harvey. Harvey Shine.
kate, Kate. Kate Walker.
harvey,"Ah, that's better. I knew something was missing.  I had to get back for a work thing."
kate, A work thing. For the job you just lost?
harvey, Yes.
kate," So, this job you lost. You liked it?"
harvey, No. Not really. They've beaten it out of me. But its what i do - did.
kate, Which is - was?
harvey, I write jingles.
kate,Wow.
harvey,That's about the normal response.
kate,Anything I would of heard?
harvey,"Yes. Uh...Uh...  Well, maybe, I mean it maybe before your time."
kate," No, go on."
harvey, You can take the Salem out of the country - but you can't take the country out of Salem.
kate,No.
harvey,It's a cigarette.
kate,Oh really?
harvey,Forget it.
kate,Ok.
harvey,"No, I just love the way you...you just cut through it."
kate,I'll take that as a compliment.
harvey,You should.  I was going to be a Jazz pianist.
kate,Were you good?
harvey,No. Not enough.
kate,"I'm sorry, I can be nosey. I tend to blurt stuff out."
harvey,No. I like it. I like it...  ...Alot.
kate,"Oh, haven't you heard?"
harvey,What?
kate,"That's all changed. We're a nation changed. Ever since Diana, we've unlocked ourselves. Everything's flowing out.  You guys showed us the way."
harvey,Just as we're trying to adopt your stiff upper lip.
kate,"No, I think, it's more this."
harvey,I see.  How's that?
kate, Yeah you're getting there. Stretch it out further.
harvey,Let me see again.
kate,"No, now you're doing a bulldog."
harvey,Like this?
kate,"No, now you look like you don't have any teeth.  Are they your own?"
harvey,What?
kate,Your teeth?
harvey,The front ones.
kate,My dad had a front one that you could just take out.
harvey,Really?
kate,Thank you. I...enjoyed myself.
harvey,Yes. So did I.
kate,I should get going. I have a class.
harvey,A class?
harvey,I don't know. I guess I'll stay in a Hotel near here. My flight's in the morning.
kate,Well...it's been a pleasure...Harvey Shine.
harvey,Yes. Yes it has.
kate,Yes.  Sorry. I'd better go.
harvey,I'd like a room please.  One night.
harvey,Sorry.
kate,Taxi's are over there. They'll take you to wherever you need to go.
harvey,Yes.  Stand near the curb so you don't get splashed.
kate,Sure.
harvey,Is that a yes?
kate,Yes.  Why not?
harvey,"Yours is a beautiful city, Kate."
kate,Its just a funny way of saying it. Quite old fashioned.
harvey,Really?
kate,"But i like it.  Yours is glorious country, Honeychurch."
harvey,"I'm afraid I'm not much of a reader.  Too fidgety, I guess."
kate,"No, we're just quite different, that's all."
harvey,Is that bad?
kate, No.
harvey,Both our phones ring a lot. We have that in common.
kate, Ah.
harvey,She worries about you?
kate,And herself.  She's convinced she's living next to Poland's answer to Ted Bundy.
harvey,I see.
kate,"She means well. She's just had a tough run.  She's basically bored. And my continued `situation' as she calls it, being single, is her major distraction. Her pastime if you will."
harvey,I see.
kate,"Yes, my rotting eggs are her raison d'tre.  Sorry."
harvey,No.
kate,I talk too much.
harvey,No. I like it.
kate,Do you?
harvey,Yes.
kate,"Hmm.  Well, here we are. My class."
harvey,How long is the class?
kate,An hour.
harvey,Can I wait?  Sorry - I promise I'm not `Bundyish'.
kate, It's getting cold. You don't want to wait.
harvey,Yes I do.
kate," Careful, I might get the wrong impression."
harvey,What can you do?
harvey,How did it go?
kate,"Oh, the usual.  Lovely mild-mannered Mike read us the latest installment from his Physcho-Sexual Thriller, and we all tried to look at him in the same way after."
harvey,Yes.
kate,Do you ever wish you could try a different life?  Just for a day. Just to see what it would be like.
harvey,What would yours be?
kate," Well, no green, that's for sure."
harvey,And what would you do there?
kate,Oh...I don't know...  I think I've got one inside me. We're not talking high art. Just a bloody good holiday read.
harvey,Ok. So this house in Spain would have a little cabana looking out over the plains for you to write in.
kate, Yes.
harvey,"And a little stream running by, to bathe in."
kate, Sure.
harvey,"I'm there.  Sorry, that's if you're receiving guests."
kate,"Sure, you can visit Harvey Shine."
harvey,"Why, thank you Kate Walker."
kate,What happened Harvey?  Between you and your daughter?
harvey,I don't know.  I just woke up one morning and realised i didn't belong.
kate,The reception. It's still going on?
harvey, I guess.
kate,Where?
harvey,The Grovesnor. Why?
kate,You must go.
harvey,What?
kate,What the hell are you doing here? You must go!
harvey,She doesn't need me.
kate,"Stop feeling so sorry for yourself. She's your daughter, you're her father. Go!"
harvey,Wait. I'm thinking.  Only if you come with me.
kate,What?
harvey,"Please, come with me. As my...bodyguard.  As my friend."
kate,"Harvey, firstly, i'm not about to go to anyone's wedding in a green polyester work suit. Secondly it's not right."
harvey,"We'll find you a dress. If we find you a dress, will you come?"
kate,No.
harvey,Please.
kate,No.
harvey,Please.
kate,No.
kate,Come on.
harvey,Hey.
susan,Hi.
harvey,I didn't go.
susan,I'm glad.
harvey,This is Kate. A... friend.
kate, Hi. Congratulations. You look fantastic.
susan,Thank you.
kate,I'm really sorry to gate-crash. Your father sort of insisted.
susan,"No, it's fine. I'm sure...  ...there's room."
harvey,"You get back. Don't worry about us, we'll find a place."
kate,Yes...
susan,No.  Could you find them a seat please.
waiter,Sure.
susan,I'd better go.
josh,Scott. What can I say...
waiter,I'm afraid this is the only place left.
harvey,That's fine.
kate,Hi.
girl,Are you Uncle Harvey?
harvey,Yes. I guess.
girl,I've heard about you.
harvey,Oh.  You're not Miriam's kid are you?
girl,Yes.
harvey,Wow...You've...got big. I mean grown up.
girl,I'm fourteen.
harvey,Wow.
kate,Hello.
josh,"So without further ado, I'd like to propose a toast to Susan for making my friend Scott complete."
brian,"Well, that's quite some speech Josh. Quite something to follow. But I shall try..."
harvey,Um... Excuse me...
jean,"For God's sake Harvey, don't make a scene."
harvey,"No Jean. I want to make a scene. You know. I'm tired of being embarrassed.  If we can't make a scene on the day of our daughter's wedding, then when can we? I want to make a scene. I want to shout! I wanna tell the world how lucky it is to have our Suzie in it!"
harvey,"I wanna tell Scott, how damn lucky he is!"
uncle fred,"Hear, hear!"
harvey," And also if he ever hurts her, I know people in north of London."
congregation,"Hear, hear!"
harvey,"And I can see from the way she looks at you. From the way she is with you, that she is... "
brian,"If you would all please join Harvey and I, in a toast.  To Susan and Scott."
congregation,Susan and Scott!
kate,Well done.
harvey,Really?
susan,Thanks for coming back Dad.
harvey,Thanks for having me back.
kate,Wow.
harvey,You are very kind. But...no.  Shearing doing Rogers.
kate,Ah.  Well...you play it very well.
harvey," Well, thank you Ms. Walker."
kate,"You're most welcome, Mr Shine."
harvey,Me thinks you were leaving?
kate,"Indeed I was, Sire."
harvey,Why?
kate,Because you looked happy.
harvey,"But, you know, maybe I want to be with you.  You make me happy - when skies are grey."
kate,"Careful, Harvey. I'm blushing."
harvey,Thank you.
kate,For what?
harvey,For making me come here.
kate,You're welcome.
harvey,Can I?
kate,What?
harvey,Can I...?
kate,Yes.
harvey, Come on. I want you to meet people. I want them to meet you.
susan,Bye Dad.
harvey,Bye Suz... Bye Susan.
susan,Be gentle with him.
harvey, Sorry.
kate,You Ok?
harvey,"Yes. Yes, I am."
kate,Sure.
kate,I don't think I've stayed up all night since I was a student.
harvey,You got sad. Why?
kate,"Oh, I don't know. My uniform's green?"
harvey,No.  I'm glad.
kate,What?
harvey,"Exactly here, at these chairs. At noon."
kate,"What about your flight, Harvey?"
harvey,I don't want to leave.  Guess why.
kate,Why?
harvey,I wanna be with you.
kate,"Shut up, Harvey."
harvey,It's true.
kate,"You say that now, but wait until tomorrow."
harvey,Today is tomorrow.
kate,Harvey we know nothing about each other. You're...
harvey,Old?
kate,"A bit older, yes.  I can be mean. Really mean."

harvey,"I guess i'll walk, then."
harvey,Shit.
porter,"Sir, are you Ok?"
harvey,I've got to go. I've got to be somewhere.
doctor,"Sir, I need you to stay calm. It looks to me like Arrhythmia - an irregular heart-beat."
harvey,"Yes, S.V.T'S, that's what I've been trying to tell the nurse. I've had it since I was a kid. I take Primax. I guess i've been forgetting to take it recently. I've been under alot of stress, that's all."
doctor,"Well Ok, then we probably know where we're at. But I need to check all possibilities."
harvey,"I know it's Arrhythmia! Please, I have to be there."
doctor,"Sir, I'm 99% sure it is. But my job is to make sure it's not that 1%. I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't check out absolutely everything.  Nurse, we'll do an EKG, followed by Bloods. And can you arranfe a monitored bed for him for tonight."
kate," Ok mum, that's me, I'm done."
maggie,Why don't you stay and have some lunch?
kate,"I can't, I've got to go.  Not to pry or anything but why is there a large smoked ham under the stairs?"
maggie,"Oh, that, yes...It's, um...The neighbour gave it to me."
kate,The polish neighbour?  So probably not a mass murderer.
maggie,Probably not.
kate,Of course I will. I'll be fine.
maggie,"Men, who needs them. Remember we've got Greece to look forward to."
kate,Yeah.

harvey," Oh, I'm still in London, Marvin."
marvin,Well you get yourself back here my friend. I've got some great news. You were right. The Samuelson account. None of the kids could handle it. They couldn't nail it. They ended up picking one of your old tunes. They want you to come back and update it.  Harvey?
harvey,"Well, that's great Marvin."
marvin,"Yeah. Yeah, `it's great'. I mean, look, I know when to eat humble pie. So look, hey, when can you get back here?  Harvey?"

kate,Hey.
harvey,Hey.
kate,You're still here - still in London...
harvey,"Yeah.  Kate, I just wanted to apologise and explain..."
kate,"No, you don't have to - explain - it's fine -"
harvey,"No, but I do -"
kate,"I don't need to hear - it's fine, seriously."
harvey,But I want to...  I had to go to Hospital.
kate,"Oh, God! Why?!"
harvey,"No, it's nothing, I'm fine, I just forgot to take my pills. I have this condition, I've had it since I was a kid - it's an irregular heart- beat sort of thing."
kate,Arrythmia.
harvey,Yes! How do you know what it is?
kate, My...My father has it.
harvey," Well, young men get it too."
kate,"Harvey, I like you, I really do. And I had a lovely time - it was great. But, you know, I don't really do fountains at noon.  I live in Willesden. And you live - in -"
harvey,White Plains.
kate,"Exactly. And we're not teenagers, so - you know, monday morning and life kicks in, all that jobs and family and brown envelopes with bills in - it was a lovely day and I won't forget it, but it's not exactly real life..."
harvey,It is. It can be.
kate,"No, Harvey, it's not."
harvey,"Kate, I want this. I want you."
kate,"But it's not just about you, is it? "
harvey,Should I take that as a hopeful sign?
kate," Oh, shut up, Harvey."
harvey,I have absolutely no idea...  I promise you that.
kate,Shall we walk?
harvey,Yes.
kate,That's better.
harvey,I think you're my kinda girl.
kate,Which ones?
harvey,"You know, from the airport. When I wouldn't stop."
kate,"Oh, the questionnaire.  Ok. Name?"
harvey,Harvey Shine.
kate,Place of residence?
harvey,I'm in transition.
