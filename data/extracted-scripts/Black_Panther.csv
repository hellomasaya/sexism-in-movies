on panther,"In a moment of desperation , the Young Militant rushes out , firing at Panther to no effect. Then , as Panther walks towards him, Nakia dives out , kicking the young militant's gun from his hand and grabs him in a neck-lock. Swinging around , Nakia kicks Panther in the chest, stopping his momentum. Caught off guard, Panther freezes ."
nakia,"This one is just a boy . .. he got kidnapped as well. Nakia pulls the wrap from the young militant's face , exposing his pre-teen expression. She removes her own hijab as well. Panther stares at her- for a beat too long ..."
okoye,"You froze . T'Challa removes his helmet , facing Nakia."
nakia,"Why are you here? Eesh, you ruined my mission !"
nakia,"Carry yourselves home now , and take the boy . Get him to his people . The Nigerian Woman nods ."

museum director,Good morning ! How can I help you?
killmonger,I was just checking out these artifacts . They tell me you're the expert .
museum director,You could say that.
killmonger,They're beautiful . Killmonger points at one of the masks .
museum director,"From the Bobo Ashanti Tribe , prese nt da y Ghana . 19th Century ."
killmon ger,For real? What about this one?
museum director,That one's from the Edo people of Benin . 16th Century .

museum director,Also from Benin . 7th Century. Fula tribe I believe .
killmonger,Nah.
killmonger,"It was taken by British soldiers in Benin but it's from Wakanda and it's made out of vibranium . Don't trip, I'mma take it off your hands for you. She looks at Killmonger like he's crazy ."
museum director,These items aren't for sale.
killmonger,How do you think your ancestors got these? You think they paid a fair price? Or did they take it like they took everything else .
museum director,"Sir , I'm going to have to ask you to leave . The Museum Director subtly looks back at the security guards , then makes a face and touches her stomach -- indigestion . Killmonger smiles and leans over, whispering in her ear ."
killmonger,"You got all this security watching me ever since I walked in. But , you ain't checking for what you put in your body . The museum director looks at Killmonger in terror as a security guard walks up behind him ."
security guard,"Alright, mate. Let's have it . Come on , mate."
killmonger,I think she might not be feelin' too good .
linda,"I'm gonna take a break. Preoccupied with the commotion, her co-worker nods and Linda walks out ."

limbani,"Step back please, gents , step back please . Museum-goers quickly bee l ine for the exit as Klaue approaches the guards."
klaue,"Hey come here. Come here! It ' s ok. You can go , but just don't tell anyone , alright? The SECURITY GUARDlooks back at him unsure, then takes off . Klaue then aims and shoots the Security Guard in the back . Killmonger looks on at him confused ."
killmonger,"Bro, why you 'aint just shoot h im right here?"
klaue,Because it's better to leave the crime scene more spread out . . . makes us look like amateurs . The LENS on a surveillance camera at the corner of the room looks on.
klaue,Now... let's see if you know what you're talking about .. . Klaue removes his glove to reveal a BIONIC PROSTHETIC hand .
killmon ger,You better sel l that quick .
klaue,"Oh it's already sold . Klaue waves Lirnbani over with the stretcher to load the hammer inside . He BREAKS the WOODEN HANDLEoff the tool , taking only the vibranium head ."
killmonger,"Whatever you try , the Wakandans ' ll probably show up ."
klaue,That ' ll make my day . I can kill two birds with one stone . Lirnbani approaches Killmonger who eyes a third MASK e xpertly
killmonger,"Nah , I'm just feeling it . Killmonger lays atop the gurney and Limbani places an oxygen mask over his face ."

zuri,Is there any member of royal blood who wishes to challenge for the throne?
ramonda,Yes .
zuri,M'Baku . What are you doing here?!
zuri,"Let the challenge begin! The warriors CLASH, both with great skill . M'Baku with superior strength. T'Challa eludes a salvo of swings, then is driven back by the tip of M'Baku's spear against his shield. Knocking M'Baku's spear free, T'Challa is HAMMERED ONTO HIS BACKbut instantly springs up to dodge more attacks and counter with TWOFIERCE KICKS. M'Baku spits blood and bangs his chest. The rest of the Jabari warriors RESPOND. T'Challa salutes the crowd and they respond LOUDER! M'Baku charges at T'Challa , knuckle-walking , and slipping his assault , T'Challa grabs M'Baku's spear and cartwheels over it to land another KICK. The two continue to battle, BLOCKINGand TRADINGBLUNT STRIKES, until M'Baku delivers a backhand that KNOCKS T'CHALLA OFF HIS FEET near the Dora's spears. With the deadly spears at his back, T'Challa blocks COLOSSAL OVERHEAD BLOWSwith his shield, then M' Baku leans with all his strength trying to impale T'Challa on the TIPS.

zuri,Darnaku . The children begin burying T'Challa in the red sand .
zuri,"Breathe , T'Challa. Breathe ! T'Challa breathes in deeply , coughing up dirt . His battle wounds have healed."
nakia,I'm right here .
nakia,"I came to support you , and to honor your father. But I can't stay. It's just ... ! found my calling out there . I've seen too many in need just to turn a blind eye . I can't be happy here knowing that there's people out there who have nothing . T'Challa thinks on this ."
nakia,"Share what we have. We could provide aid and access to technology and refuge to those who need it ... other countries do it, we do it better."
t' challa,"We are not like these other countries, Nakia. If the world found out what we truly are, and what we possess -- we could lose our way of life."
nakia,Wakanda is strong enough to help others and protect ourselves at the same time . Nakia gives T'Challa a look .
nakia,I would make a great queen because I am so stubborn .

an,"a golden pyramid, T' Challa , W'Kabi, Ramonda and ELDERS from each tribe except the Jabari sit in a circle as Okoye briefs them . W'Kabi and Ramonda flank T'Challa's throne ."
okoye,A misidentified Wakandan artifact was stolen yesterday from a British museum . We have learned Ulysses Klaue plans to sell the vibraniurn to an American buyer in South Korea tomorrow night . There are audible murmurs at the name of Ulysses Klaue .
okoye,It's too great an opportunity to pass.
a dragonflyer,lands outside the WAKANDAN
shuri,You sure it's a good idea to take your e x on a mission?
shuri,"I have great things to show you , brother . Here are your communication devices for Korea . Unlimited range , also equipped with audio surveillance system . She walks him over to another table with WDGdisks on them ."
shuri,The real question is what are those? Why do you have your toes out in my lab? Shuri points at T'Challa's traditional sandals . T'Challa smiles .
shuri, Yea I bet the elders loved that . Try them on .
shuri,Guess what I ca l l them . T'Challa thinks on this .
shuri,The nanites absorb the kinetic energy and hold it in place for redistribu t ion .
shuri,"Now strike it again , in the same spot . T'Challa backs up for a kick. Shuri presses record on her Kimoyo . T'Challa sees this and looks at her suspiciously ."
le,of Shuri's gadgets . Shuri cracks up.
okoye,"Bast willing this goes quickly , and I can get this ridiculous thing off my head ."
okoye,"What? It's a disgrace . Looky - loos stare as Nakia leads them to an ELDERLYWOMAN  , se ll ing fish i n front of an al l ey . Nakia greets her in perfect Korean."
t' challa,Spread out. The buyer is likely already here. Okoye heads for the BALCONY VANTAGE POINT while T'Challa and Nakia go down to the FIRST FLOOR.
nakia,"Ah, I got into a disagreement with some ivory traders . Made a bit of a mess ."
t' challa,"And will there be any trouble tonight, Ms. Kenyan heiress?"
nakia,Depends on how quickly we finish the mission ...
ross,Your highness . Ross plays it cool .
ross,"What I'm doing or not doing on behalf of the US government is of none of your concern. Now, whatever the hell you're up to , do me a favor and stay out of my way."
ross,And didn't I kept it under wraps that the King of a third world country runs around in a bulletproof cat suit. I ' d say we were even . Ross places a Pass bet. T'Challa dumps a stack of chips on Don't Pass. All of the SHOOTER'S FRIENDS blow on the dice.
t' challa,"Klaue is leaving out that door with me. You've been warned. T'Challa walks toward another craps table , leaving the pile of chips behind  ."
ross, who was sitting next to T'Challa grabs them . Ross eyes the Thirsty Gambler who shrugs .
thirsty gambler,"You know what, I think I'll just take these , bring 'em over here and hold on for safe keeping . He slides them all onto the DON'T PASS bet and Ross walks off in search of T'Challa ."
t' challa,General .
on nakia,Who changes position from the bar to the CRAPS TABLE where T'Challa was initially standing .
nakia,I don't see it yet .
on okoye,As TWOOF KLAUES TOUGHSpost ' up on either side of her on the balcony . She trie s to play it cool as they look around at the patrons s uspiciously .
okoye,I thoug ht there were no weapons allo wed in here .
okoye,Someone did not get the memo. Definitely armed .
on klaue,Klaue spots Ross and smiles as he heads down the stairs flanked by a couple of his TOUGHS.
ross,Well that is quite the entourage . You got a mixtape coming out? Klaue cuts Ross a look .
klaue,"Yeah ! Yeah , actually there is one . Shocked , Ross is unsure if Kl aue is serious ."
ross,"Please don't make me listen to your music . I just meant , you got a lot of people with yo u."
klaue,"Oh, you think they're for you? Klaue laughs at this ."
klaue,You got the diamonds? Klaue is still rubbing Ross' shoulder .
ross,"Ok, that's enough. A CIA AGENTwalks a FANCYSLIM BRIEFCASE towards Ross."
nakia,We need to move on Klaue.
ross,"The vibranium? Klaue looks around , and reaches into his pants and pulls out a wrinkled, sweaty paper bag, with ""FRAGILE"" written on it with a sharpie . Ross looks at the bag."
klaue,"I was going to buy a fancy suitcase, but I thought I'd save myself some money ."
nakia,It's now or never . Nakia continues towards the CIA agent.
southafrican tough,Hey. Okoye pretends she doesn't hear him.
downstairs,"The arm-bar tough CRASHESDOWN onto a gaming table behind Klaue and startled patrons , scramble in every direction . Klaue spins toward the commotion as ... Klaue looks back to Ross and spots T'Challa. Producing a HANDGUN from his waist, Klaue opens fire on Ross and the CIA agent . Ross uses the SLIM SUITCASE as a shield as he ducks down below the craps table and . . . T'Challa leaps to action , KICKING and FLIPPING THE TABLE on its edge to block GUNFIRE from Klaue's other toughs. With bullets flying everywhere ... PANICKEDPEOPLE run for their lives . It's CHAOS. Surrounded by TOUGHS Klaue retreats , for the stairs ."
klaue,"Get the diamonds, quick ! EVERYONE OF KLAUE'S TOUGHSunload, raining shells on the overturned craps table with Ross and T'Challa behind it . The TOUGHS move in only to have T'Challa leap from the table , staying low to FOOTSWEEP one onto his back . T'Challa kicks him back then disarms another TOUGHand kicks him into the bar . T'Challa then spins and kicks the next TOUGHover the roulette table and through the bar railing. Nakia grabs a goon in an ARMTWIST trying to relieve him of his gun . She takes off one shoe and knocks out another approaching gun. Swings the arm twisted goon to the floor, knocks him out, taking his gun and shooting up towards the balcony where Okoye is fighting ."
on okoye,"Okoye BATTLES TWOTOUGHSwith her full-length spear, dropping both with proficiency ."
klaue,"You know, you look just like your old man. T'Challa snatches up a ROLLING CHANGECART TABLE just as Klaue fires the blaster at him . BOOOOM ! A COLOSSALSONIC BLAST hits the cart, !! blowing it to pieces and sending T'Challa FLYING THROUGH THE UPPER BALCONY RAILING back down into the pit . With money FLOATING in the air , T'Challa lands hard ."
klaue,"That was awesome! That was awesome! Let's go ! Go, go , come on! Klaue jumps in the first of FOUR IDLING 4RUNNERS. The convoy instantly skids away as ... Nakia and Okoye emerge . Okoye throws an EMP bead from her pocket and it lands on a parked LEXUS LC."
nakia,Do we just leave him?
okoye,He'll catch up. Nakia starts the car and Okoye climbs in . T'Challa sprints out of casino .
shuri,"Okay okay, calm down brother !"
shuri,Wool Let's go !
klaue,Put some music on ! What do you think this is a funeral?
nakia,Which one is he in now?
okoye,They're trying to lose us .
shuri,We'll take the other two ! I see a short cut .
shuri,We're not going to make it!
shuri,Wool Brother !
shuri,"Hey , what was that ! ?"
okoye,"Guns . So primitive . I/e . KLAUE'S 4RUNNER, SPEAR STREET - NIGHT Klaue barks into his comm."
nakia,What are you doing?
okoye,Just drive .
nakia,"Eesh . Nakia drops back and weaves through traffic as Okoye , engages her SPEAR MECHANISM,then steadies herself and let's her long spear fly , launching the weapon like a javelin."
of,"truck, SPIKING THE GROUND and bringing the SUV to a stop with the force of a head on collision !"
wool,"I/e . KLAUE'S 4RUNNER, SPEAR STREET - NIGHT"
klaue,Oh shoot.
driver,"Where'd he go ! ? Then out of nowhere, PANTHERLANDSHARDon the hood of the"
shuri,You show off.
nakia,There he is ! Hold tight !
klaue,"Right, let's have some fun . Sitting on the windowsill, Klaue aims his SONIC DISRUPTER."
on okoye,"As she twists through the air , her feet remain planted on a shredded piece of the cars' roof. She l ands on her feet, speed-skating to a stop ."
on nakia,"Nakia skids up next to Okoye on the driver's seat , still buckled in ."
ross,Hop in . Put that spear in the trunk .
shuri,I ' m going as fast as I can !
klaue,"Take a right , take a right !"
klaue,You savages didn ' t deserve it . T'Challa grabs him by the throat and slams him into the SUV.
t' challa,Every breath you take is mercy from me.
ng,cellphones as SIRENS can be heard in the distance .
ross,"Come on guys , let's go huh? T'Challa eyes around. He has little choice and nods."
klaue,"Hello! I can see you ! I can , I can see you."
ross,"So, this is a big mess, huh? I figured we can go good cop bad cop . I'll talk to him first, then you guys go in -- Okoye turns to T'Challa .  OKOYE Better to let him talk to Klaue alone for 5 minutes than to make a scene here .  59 ."
ross,"What? No. Look I like you, a lot. But he's in my custody now. He's not going anywhere . Listen , I 'm doing you a favor by letting you even be in here. Ross reaches out and touches T'Challa . Okoye steps in."
ross,Does she speak English?
okoye,When she wants to. Ross and Okoye eye each other for a long beat.
ross,"I'm going in . And when I'm done, you guys are up."
ross,Yea. T'Challa puts his hand on Ross's shoulder .
ross,"You see that? It's called diplomacy . You're welcome. Ross walks through the door, closing it behind him ."
okoye,"Eh , Americans ..."
klaue,"You know, you really shouldn ' t trust the Wakandans. I'm much more your speed."
ross,"I don't trust anybody, not in this job . But what I am interested in is that arm cannon out there. Where'd you get that?"
klaue,It's an old mining tool that I made some adjustments to. But I can get you one if you'd like .
ross,Why don't you give me the name of your supplier and I'll ask them.
klaue,"He's right outside , why don't you ask him yourself?"
ross,T' Challa? You're telling me that weapon on your arm is from Wakanda? Klaue nods.
klaue,Bingo .
ross,Shepherds . Textiles . Cool outfits. Ross stops as we notice a MICRO AUDIO BUG on his shoulder that T'Challa planted before he entered the room .
klaue,"It's all a front . Explorers searched for it for centuries . El Dorado : The Golden City . They thought they could find it in South America, but it was in Africa the whole time . A technological marvel. All because it was built on a mound of the most valuable metal known to man- Isipho- they call it . The gift . Vibranium ..."
ross,Vibranium yea . Strongest metal on Earth.
klaue,"It's not just a metal ... They sew it into their clothes , it powers their city, their tech, their weapons ..."
ross,Weapons?
klaue,Oh yes . Makes my arm cannon look like a leaf blower .
ross,That's a nice fairy tale but Wakanda is a third world country and you stole all their vibranium .
ross,Your father to l d the UN that Klaue stole all the vibraniurn you had . But now he's telling me you have more?
ross,How much more are you hiding? Then suddenly . . . Nakia SLAMSthrough the door . CIA AGENTS draw their weapons. Nakia is unfazed.
klaue,I see you took your time didn't you ! Killmonger continues to FIRE as Lirnbani and Linda hop in and begin to pull off.
nakia,"He just jumped in front of me. Gravely wounded, Ross is barely conscious ."
okoye,Our missions was to bring back Klaue . We failed . This man is a foreign intelligence operative. How do we justify bringing him into our borders?
nakia,He took a bullet for me.
okoye,"That was his choice . T'Challa stiffens. Okoye has gone a little too far. Torn, Nakia stares off, thinking about the Nigerian women they didn't bring back to Wakanda and her culpability in Ross' injury ."
nakia,So now we are just supposed to let him die?
okoye,"Let us consider that we heal him. It is his duty to report back to his country. And as King, it is your duty to protect ours."
afternoon,"Shuri covertly l eads T'Challa , Okoye and Nakia inside , carrying Ross ' s body on a Maglev stretcher. She turns to T'Challa ."
shuri,"Great , another broken white boy for us to fi x. This is going to be fun. T' Challa cuts Shuri a look ."
noon,Ros s is placed on a table surrounded by futuri s tic medical equipment . As Shuri works on him .
shuri,He will live . The security alarm on Shuri's Kimoyo bead GOES OFF.
w' kabi,"Slipped? For 30 years your father was in power and did nothing . With you I thought it would be different . But it's more of the same . Deeply disappointed , W' Kabi can't muster words . He looks at T'Challa and wal ks out ."
limbani,"Let's get going, boss."
killmonger,You always sell to the CIA?
klaue,"I sell to the highest bidder . Don' t you worry when I get back to Jo- burg and lay low for a bit, I ' ll make sure both you guys get paid."
killmonger,"Oh I ain't worried about the money, bro . I know you're good for it . Klaue smiles."
klaue,"You don't wanna go there, boy ."
killmonger,"Yea I do . Killmonger suddenly draws a HANDGUN and SHOOTSLIMBANI DEAD. Reacting to the shot , Klaue crowds Linda with a skilled GRAPPLINGMOVEand snatches her gun away before she can fire on him . Killmonger finds Klaue holding Linda's gun to her head, using her as his shield ."
linda,"I'm sorry . I'm sorry , Erik ."
killmonger,"It's gonna be ok . Killmonger fires without hesitation . The BULLET TRAVELS THROUGH Linda , ki lli ng her while Klaue dives behind the plane , WOUNDED THE SHOULDER IN from the round . Killmonger moves to finish Klaue but he's gone . Following Klaue's blood trail , Killmonger STALKS Klaue through the"
klaue,... Y-You really wanna go to Wakanda? They're savages. Klaue shows his BRANDEDneck .
killmonger,"I ain't worried about no brand . Check these out. Killmonger rolls up his sleeve , uncovering SEVERALAFRICAN SCARIFICATION MARKSon his forearm ."
klaue,"You can sca r yourself as much as you like . To them , you'll just be an outsider. You're crazy to think that you could walk in there . Killmonger flips the inside of his bottom lip, revealing a glowing Wakandan TATTOO. Klaue can't believe his eyes ."
zuri,So your mission did not go as planned .
zuri,That is not possible .
t' challa,He helped Klaue escape from us and he was wearing this ring . My grandfather ' s ring . Do not tell me what is possible tell me the truth .
zuri,"Some truths are too much to bear , T'Challa."
zuri,I promised the King to say nothing .
zuri,Your uncle took a War Dog assignment in America . Your father placed me there to observe unbeknownst to him. Your uncle fell in love with an American woman. They had a child . The hardships he saw there radicalized your uncle.
zuri,"He knew your father would not support this , so your uncle betrayed us."
zuri,He helped Klaue steal the vibranium .
aiming,"it at James/Young Zuri's head, freezing him ."
zuri,To save my life .
zuri,We left him .
flashback,"One of the young kids playing basketball, who is now revealed to be YOUNG KILLMONGER stands looking up at the sky where the mysterious lights flickered."
zuri,"We had to maintain the lie . Gutted , T'Challa can't reconcile what he's just heard . He turns his back on Zuri ."
killmonger,"Just a 'lil gift . Killmonger opens his bag , revealing KLAUE'S CORPSE W'Kabi's"
ross,"Alright, where am I? Startled, Shuri spins ."
shuri,"Don't scare me like that, colonizer ."
ross,Colon-who? My name is Everett .
shuri,"Yes , I know . Everett Ross former airforce pilot and now, CIA."
ross,"Right. Groggy, Ross gazes around at the completely unique technology ."
ross,... How long ago was Korea?
ross,I don't think so . Bullet wounds don't just magically heal overnight.
ross,"These train things ... that's magnetic levitation, right?"
ross,"Obviously ... but I've never seen it this efficient . The light panels, what are they?"
ross,Sonic what?
shuri,There is vibranium all around us. That's how I healed you. Ross tries to process this as a 3D PROJECTION OF OKOYE unexpectedly forms.
ross,He's not a Wakandan . He's one of ours.
t' challa,He killed his own brother ... and left a child behind with nothing . What kind of King  . . what kind of man does that?
nakia,No man is perfect . Not even your father.
nakia,Hey . Look at me. You can't let your father ' s mistakes define who you are . You get to decide what kind of King you are going to be. They share a look as T'C ha l la's Kimoyo beads buzz .
shuri's projection,"Brother , you need to get here now. T' Chall a and Nakia look at each othe r."
ross,Eric Stevens . Graduated Annapolis age 19 . MIT for grad school . Joined the SEALs and went to Afghanistan where he racked up confirmed kills like it was a video game . They him Killmonger . He
started calling,joined a JSOC ghost unit .
shuri,He has a War Dog tattoo but we have no record of him . T' Challa and Shuri share a look .
killmonger,I'm standing in your house . Serving justice to a man who stole your vibranium and murdered your people . Justice your King couldn't deliver. T'Challa walks close enough to Killmonger to be able to whisper to him .
ger,I want the throne . The entire room scoffs at this . Some ELDERS even hold their heads back and laugh .
killmonger,"Y'all sittin' up here comfortable. Must feel good . There's about 2 billion people all over the world that looks like us but their lives are a lot harder , Wakanda has the tools to liberate them all ."
killmonger,Vibranium . Your weapons.
killmonger,"Not your own? But didn't life start here , on this continent? So ain ' t all people your people?"
ramonda,"Son , we have entertained this charlatan for too long. Reject his request . Killmonger eyes the Elders with an amused grin ."
killmon ger,"Oh, I ain't requesting nothing ! Ask who I am?"
shuri,You are Eric Stevens. An American black operative . A mercenary nicknamed Killmonger. That's who you are .
ger,Ask me.
killmonger,I found my daddy with Panther claws in his chest . You ain't the son of a King you're the son of a murderer!
ramonda,  Lies.  W'KABI I'm afraid not Queen Mother .
killmonger,Hey Auntie .
ramonda,Do not do this T'Challa.
bordertribe elder,As the son of N'Jobu he is within his rights .
ramonda,He has no rights here.
killmonger,Weeks? I don't need weeks. The whole country ain't gotta be there I just need him ... and somebody to get me out of these chains.
ramonda,"T'Challa, what do you know of this?"
to,"The Tribal Elders , W'Kabi , and the Dora look on from their respective places . Shuri watches with Ramonda , but the stands are entirely empty ."
shuri,He will never beat T' Challa . He should have just come to t he first challenge and gotten it over with . Ramonda looks concerned . She ' s not so sure.

okoye,"For Wakanda?  Without question . W'Kabi sees the fire in Okoye's eyes . He looks around at the battlefie l d where the remaining Border Tribesmen are surrendering to the Jabari and Dora . W'Kabi looks at Okoye for long beat, then throws his sword into the dirt and kneels in front of her ."
killmon ger,"This is it for you , cousin . T'Challa turns towards the train and sees that it is about to end. He lets Killmonger swing towards him and dodges , backing up even closer to the edge of the track, and Killmonger swings again - but this time T'Challa punches Killmonger's arm , jarring the blade lose and sending it flying up into the air. T'Challa then does a ROLLING ARMBAR TAKEDOWN the"

Killmonger removes his helmet , then looks down at the blade that is buried in his chest . T'Challa, realizing this is it , removes his mask as well."
killmonger,It's beautiful . T'Challa thinks for a long beat.
killmonger,"Why? So you can just lock me up? Nah . Just bury me in the ocean, with my ancestors that jumped from the ships . . . 'cause they knew death was better than bondage. Killmonger pulls the knife out of his chest, killing himself instantly. T'Challa looks down at his cousin's now lifeless body and becomes emotional."

shuri,"You're kidding ! T'Challa hits a button on his Kimoyo bead , and the RTF comes out of cloaking , revealing itself to have been parked behind the kids playing basketball . A YOUNG BLACKKID turns back to see the ship as the other kids collectively lose their shit ."
youngblack kid,What . ..
youngblackkid,Hey yo ! Is this yours?
a frenchambassador,can't help but lean into his microphone .
frenchambassador,"With all due respect , King T'Challa , what can a nation of farmers offer to the rest of the world? There are a few chuckles from the gallery . Nakia , Okoye and Ayo share a look. T'Challa smiles ."
shuri,Are you playing around with that man again?
