diva,"Oh how divine Glamour, music and magic combine See the maidens so anxious to shine Look for a sign that enhances Chances She'll be his special one"
diva,"What a display! What a breathtaking thrilling array  Every prince, every dog has his day Let us sing with passion, gusto Fit to bust - oh Not a care in the world"
belle,"Little town, it's a quiet village Every day like the one before Little town full of little people Waking up to say..."
villagers,Bonjour.   Bonjour. Bonjour.   Bonjour.
vagrant,Bonjour.
belle,There goes the baker with his tray like always The same old bread and rolls to sell
jean,"Good morning, Belle"
belle,"Good morning, Monsieur Jean.   Have you lost something again?"
jean,"I believe I have. Problem is, I can't remember what. Well, I'm sure it will come to me."
belle,To return this book to Pere Robert. It's about two lovers in fair Verona.
nasty headmaster,"Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?"
little girls,No denying she's a funny girl That Belle
clothilde,I need six eggs
belle,There must be more than this provincial life
pere robert,Well! If it isn't the only bookworm in town. So where did you run off to this week?
belle,Two cities in Northern Italy.    I didn't want to come back.
pere robert,I'm afraid not. But you may reread any of the old ones that you'd like.
belle,"Thank you, Pere Robert. Your library almost makes our small corner of the world feel big."
pere robert,Bon voyage.
gaston,"Look at her, LeFou. My future wife. Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village. That makes her the best."
lefou,"But she's so well-read, and you're so...  Athletically inclined."
gaston,I know. Belle can be as argumentative as she is beautiful.
lefou,"Exactly, who needs her, when you've got us!"
gaston,"Yes, but ever since the war I've been missing something. And she's the only girl I've met who gives me that sense of..."
gaston," Right from the moment when I met her, saw her I said she's gorgeous and I fell Here in town there's only she Who is beautiful as me So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle"
village lasses,"Look there he goes, isn't he dreamy Monsieur Gaston, oh he's so cute Be still my heart I'm hardly breathing He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute"
all,Look there she goes a girl who's Strange but special A most peculiar mademoiselle It's a pity and a sin She doesn't quite fit in!
village lasses,But she really is a funny girl
village men,A beauty but a funny girl
all,She really is a funny girl that Belle!
gaston,"Good morning, Belle!   Wonderful book you have there."
belle,You've read it?
gaston,"Well, not that one. But, you know. Books.  For your dinner table. Shall I join you this evening?"
gaston,"No, LeFou. It's the ones who play hard to get that are always the sweetest prey."
belle,"Papa, do you think I'm odd?"
maurice,My daughter? Odd?     Where did you get an idea like that?
belle,I don't know. People talk.
maurice,What would you like me to bring you from the market?
belle,A rose like the one in the painting.
maurice,You ask for that every year.
belle,"And every year, you bring it."
maurice,"Then I shall bring you another. You have my word. Come on, Philippe!"
washer girl,What are you doing?
belle,The laundry.
nasty headmaster,What on earth are you doing?
clothilde,We have to do something.
gaston,"You are the wildest, most beautiful thing I've ever seen. No one deserves you, but at least I know our children will be beautiful."
lefou,A certain damsel is in distress.
gaston,Oh well. It's hero time.  I'm not done with you yet.
belle,All I wanted was to teach a child to read.
gaston,The only children you should concern yourself with are... your own.
belle,I'm not ready to have children.
gaston,Maybe you haven't met the right man.
belle,"It's a small village, Gaston.     I've met them all."
gaston,Maybe you should take another look. Some of us have changed.
belle,"I might be a farm girl, but I'm not simple. I'm sorry, but I will never marry you, Gaston."
belle,"Can you imagine? Me, the wife of that boorish, brainless..."
belle,I want adventure in the great wide somewhere I want it more than I can tell And for once it might be grand To have someone understand I want so much more than They've got planned
maurice,"The woods are lovely, aren't they Philippe...? I only wish I recognized them. Do you know where we are? Because I don't."
maurice,"Go, Philippe! Hurry!"
maurice,Hello?   Anyone home?
chip,Mom said I wasn't supposed to move because it might be scary. Sorry.
maurice,"Thank you. Really, I cannot thank you enough for your hospitality...  ... And kindness."
belle,Philippe?
lumire,"Look, Cogsworth. A beautiful girl."
cogsworth,"I can see it's a girl.    I lost my hands, not my eyes."
lumire,But what if she is the one?   The one who will break the spell?
belle,Who said that? Who's there?
belle,Papa!?   Is that you?
belle,"Oh, your hands are ice.   We need to get you home."
maurice,"Belle, you must leave here at once. This castle is alive! Now go, before he finds you!"
belle,I've come for my father.
belle,Liar!
belle,"I asked for the rose.   Punish me, not him!"
maurice,"No, he means forever. Apparently that's what happens around here when you pick a flower."
belle,A life sentence for a rose?
the beast,I received eternal damnation for one. I'm merely locking him away. Now... do you still wish to take your father's place?
belle,Come into the light.
the beast,CHOOSE!
maurice,"Belle, I won't let you do this. I lost your mother. I won't lose you too. Now go!"
belle,"Alright, Papa. I will leave.  I need a minute alone with him."
the beast,"When this door closes, it will not open again."
belle,I should have been with you.
maurice,"Belle, listen to me. It's all right. Live your life. Forget me."
maurice,What?!
the beast,You took his place.
belle,He is my father.
belle,Don't hurt him!
maurice,Belle!   I'll come back!    I promise!
belle,My room?   But I thought --
belle,AHHH!
lumire," Oh, you are very strong.    That's a great quality!"
belle,What are you?
lumire,"You must forgive first impressions, I hope you are not too startled."
cogsworth,Except the west wing!
belle,It's... beautiful.
lumire,Of course. Master wanted you to have the finest room in the castle.
lumire,"I would risk anything to kiss you again, Plumette."
plumette,"No, my love. I've been burned by you before. We must be strong."
lumire,How can I be strong when you make me so weak?
lumire,"Do not be alarmed, mademoiselle. This is just your wardrobe. Meet Madame De Garderobe. A great singer."
lumire,"Ah, stay with us, Madame!    We have someone for you to dress!"
garderobe,Finally. A woman. Pretty eyes. Proud face. Perfect canvas. Yes! I will find you something worthy of a princess.
belle,But I'm not a princess.
garderobe,"Nonsense! Now, let's see what I've got in my drawers."
garderobe,"Froufrou, send my love to the maestro!"
gaston,"Picture it, LeFou -- a rustic cabin. My latest kill roasting on the fire. Adorable children running around us while my love rubs my tired feet. But what does Belle say? ""I will never marry you, Gaston."""
lefou,"You know, there are other girls."
gaston,A great hunter doesn't waste his time on rabbits.
lefou,Gosh it disturbs me to see you Gaston looking so down in the dumps Every guy here'd love to be you Gaston Even when taking your lumps There's no man in town as admired as you You're everyone's fa-vor-ite guy Everyone's awed and inspired by you And it's not very hard to see why
lefou,Who's much more than the sum of his parts like Gaston?
gaston," As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating"
gaston,"I needed encouragement; thank you, LeFou"
lefou,"Well, there's no one as easy to bolster as you!"
lefou,In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston!
lefou,Is that fair?
gaston,I don't care
villagers,No one hits like Gaston Matches wits like Gaston
lefou,In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston
gaston,I'M ESPECIALLY GOOD AT EXPECTORATING!
villagers,Ten points for Gaston!
gaston,Who can make up these endless Refrains like Gaston?
lefou,"And his name's `G-A-S-T... ' Uh, I believe there's another `T' in there, it just occurred to me that I'm illiterate and I've never actually had to spell it out loud before... Gaston!"
gaston,"Ah LeFou, you're the best. How is it that no girl has snatched you up yet?"
lefou,"I've been told I'm clingy, but I really don't get it..."
maurice,Help! Somebody help me! We have to go... not a minute to lose...
tavern keeper,"Whoa.   Slow down, Maurice."
maurice,He's got Belle... locked in a dungeon!
tavern keeper,Who's got her?
maurice,A beast... a horrible monstrous beast!
jean,Winter in June?
maurice,The beast is real! Do you understand?! Will no one help me?!
gaston," I'll help you, Maurice!"
lefou,You will?
gaston, Everyone! Stop making fun of this man at once!
maurice,"Thank you, Captain.   Thank you."
gaston,"Don't thank me, Maurice.    Lead us to the beast."
lefou, Ohhh.
chip,"Mama, there's a girl in the castle!"
chip,Is she pretty? Is she nice?     What kind of tea does she like?
cuisinir,"Heads up, Mrs. Potts!"
lumire,"Be calm, let me do the talking."
the beast,YOU'RE MAKING HER DINNER!?
lumire,We thought you might appreciate the company.
cogsworth,"Master, I can assure you that I had no part in this hopeless plan. Preparing a dinner, designing a gown for her, giving her a suite in the east wing --"
the beast,YOU GAVE HER A BEDROOM!?
lumire,"That is true. But if the girl is the one who can break the spell, maybe you can start by using dinner to charm her.  Good thinking, Cogsworth!"
the beast,"That's the most ridiculous idea I've ever heard! ""Charm the prisoner."""
lumire,"You must try, master. With every passing day, we become less human."
the beast,She's the daughter of a common thief. What kind of person do you think that makes her?
the beast,You will join me for dinner!     That's not a request.
lumire,"Yes. The poor thing is probably in there, scared to death."
belle,Just a minute.
lumire,"You see, there she is.    Now, master, remember. Be gentle."
plumette,...charming...
lumire,"And when she opens the door, give her a dashing debonair smile. Come come -- show me the smile."
the beast,Will you join me for dinner?
belle,You've taken me prisoner and now you want to have dinner with me? Are you insane?
plumette,He's losing it...
the beast,I told you to come down to dinner.
belle,And I told you no!
garderobe,WHAT!?    WHAT TIME IS IT!?
belle,I'd starve before I ever ate with you!
the beast,"Well be my guest! Go ahead and starve!  If she doesn't eat with me, then she doesn't eat at all!"
cogsworth,"You can't talk to us like that! I forbid it! I... I...  Oh master, you've returned!  Cogsworth shrieks and spins -- only to realize he's been duped.  COGSWORTH Oh, very funny.  LUMIRE Eh, I got you there!"
the beast,Show me the girl.
lumire,"I know, darling -- Ow! I'm getting more metallic every day."
cogsworth,"Oh, no! It's -- tick tock! -- happening again -- cuckoo! Pardon me."
chip,"Mama, am I ever going to be a boy again?"
belle,I told you to go away.
chip,Pleased to meet you!    Want to see me do a trick?
garderobe,Yes.    We all think so.
belle,I'm so worried about him.      He's never been on his own.
belle,"But he said, ""If she doesn't eat with me, she doesn't eat at all."""
lumire,"They're coming! Final checks, everyone, tout de suite!"
cogsworth,"No, you don't! If the master finds out you violated his orders and fed her, he will blame me."
lumire,"Yes, I will make sure of it. But did you see her stand up to him? I am telling you, this girl is the one. They must fall in love if we are to be human again, and they can't fall in love if she stays in her room.  Eh, Chapeau, you missed a spot!"
cogsworth,You know she will never love him.
lumire,"A broken clock is right two times a day, mon ami, and this is not one of those times."
lumire,"Of course, of course. But what is dinner without a little... music?"
cogsworth,Music?!
lumire,"Maestro Cadenza, are you ready?"
cadenza, It has been so long since I've performed! I can barely even remember how...
lumire,"Maestro, your wife is upstairs, finding it harder and harder to stay awake. She's counting on you to help us break this curse."
cadenza,"Then, I shall play through the dental pain!"
cogsworth, But Maestro. Play quietly. Please.
lumire,"Ma chere, mademoiselle. It is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight. And now, we invite you to relax."
lumire,"Beef ragout, cheese souffle, Pie and pudding en flamb!"
chandelier candlesticks,And it's all in perfect taste That you can bet!
lumire,"Come on and lift your glass You've won your own free pass To be our guest  If you're stressed, it's fine dining we suggest."
all,Be our guest! Be our guest! Our command is your request! It's years since we had anybody Here and we're obsessed!
lumire,Pudding?!
the beast,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!?    WHAT DID YOU DO TO IT!?
belle,Nothing.
the beast,DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE!? YOU COULD HAVE DAMNED US ALL! GET OUT! GO!
belle,You have to help me... you have to stand...
maurice,No! I'm sure this is the way! Do you hear those wolves? That means we're getting very close to the castle.
gaston,"Look, enough is enough.   We have to turn back."
maurice,Stop!   That's it!
lefou, You really want to marry into this family?
maurice,So that means the castle is definitely that way!
gaston,I'm done playing this game of yours. Where is Belle?
maurice,The beast took her!
gaston,"There are no such things as beasts, or talking teacups, or... magic! But there are wolves, frostbite, and starvation."
gaston,Because I want to marry your daughter! Now let's go home.
maurice,Belle is not at home!   She's with the --
gaston,"IF YOU SAY BEAST ONE MORE TIME, I WILL FEED YOU TO THE WOLVES!"
lefou,"GASTON! STOP! Breathe. Think happy thoughts. Go back to the war. Blood, explosions, countless widows..."
gaston,"Please, forgive me, old bean. That's no way to talk to my future father-in-law, now is it?"
maurice,Future father-in-law...?   You will never marry my daughter.
gaston,"If Maurice won't give me his blessing, then he is in my way. Once the wolves are finished with him, Belle will have no one to take care of her but me."
lefou,"For the sake of exhausting all of our options, do we maybe want to consider a less gruesome alternative?"
the beast,ROOOOAARRRR! Ow! That hurts!
belle,"If you held still, it wouldn't hurt as much."
lumire,We are eternally grateful.
belle,Why do you care so much about him?
belle,But he has cursed you somehow.  Why? You did nothing.
all,Days in the sun Will return - we must believe As lovers do That days in the sun Will come shining through
belle,What happens when the last petal falls?
lumire,The master remains a beast forever.     And the rest of us become...
belle,I want to help you. There must be some way to lift the curse.
agathe,Drink.
belle,It's wonderful.
the beast,"Oh. Yes, I suppose it is... Well, if you like it so much, then it's yours."
belle,Have you really read every one of these books?
belle,There's something sweet and almost kind But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
belle,New and a bit alarming Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
plumette,"Well, who'd have thought?"
cogsworth,"Well, who'd have known?"
lumire,"Well, who indeed?"
all,We'll wait and see! A few days more 
cogsworth,"You know, perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before."
chip,"What, mama?"
chip,"What is it, what's there?"
belle,I never thanked you for saving my life.
the beast,Well I never thanked you... for not leaving me to be eaten by wolves.
belle,They know how to have a good time.
the beast,"Yes. But when I enter the room, laughter dies."
belle,"Me, too. The villagers say that I'm a ""funny girl,"" but I don't think they mean it as a compliment."
the beast,I'm sorry.     Your village sounds terrible.
belle,Almost as lonely as your castle.
the beast,"Another little ""gift"" from the Enchantress..."
belle,How amazing.
the beast,It was her cruelest trick of all. The outside world has no place for a creature like me. But it can for you.
the beast,Where did you take us?
belle,Paris.
the beast,"Oh, I love Paris. What would you like to see first? Notre Dame? The Champs- Elyses? No? Too touristy?"
belle,It's so much smaller than I imagined.
the beast,What happened to your mother?
belle,That's the only story Papa could never bring himself to tell. And I knew better than to ask...
the beast,Plague.
the beast,I am sorry I ever called your father a thief.
belle,Let's go home.
lefou,"Wow, this is some storm. At least we're not tied to a tree in the middle of nowhere, right? You know it's not too late, we could just go get him..."
gaston,"Oh, Maurice! Thank heavens. I've spent the last five days trying to find you."
maurice,No! You tried to kill me!    You left me for the wolves!
gaston,"Maurice, it's one thing to rave about your delusions. It's another to accuse me of attempted murder."
jean,"Maurice, do you have any proof of what you're saying?"
maurice,Ask Agathe! She rescued me!
gaston,"Agathe? You'd hang your accusation on the testimony of a filthy hag?  No offense, Agathe."
maurice,Monsieur LeFou! He was there.     He saw it all.
gaston,You're right. Don't take my word for it.
gaston,"Maurice, it pains me to say this, but you've become a danger to yourself and others. No wonder Belle ran away. You need help, sir. A place to heal your troubled mind."
the beast,I feel like a fool. She will never love me.
lumire,Do not be discouraged.
lumire,"You care for her, don't you? Well then, woo her with beautiful music and romantic candlelight..."
the beast,I haven't danced in years.   I'd almost forgotten the feeling.
the beast, You must go to him.
belle,What did you say?
the beast,You must go to him. No time to waste.
belle,Thank you.
cogsworth,"Well, master, I may have had my doubts, but everything is moving like clockwork. True love really does win the day!"
the beast,I let her go.
cogsworth,You... WHAT!?
lumire,Master... how could you do that?
the beast,I had to.
lumire,Then why are we not human?
cogsworth," Because she doesn't love him!    And now, it's too late."
the beast,I'll never shake away the pain I close my eyes but she's still there I let her steal into my melancholy heart It's more than I can bear
gaston,"Have you ever seen the inside of a mad house, Maurice? You wouldn't last a week. Just give me your daughter's hand, and I'll set you free."
gaston,Take him away!
villagers,"""Belle..."" ""Where did she come from?"" ""Is that Belle..."" ""Look at that dress..."""
maurice,Belle?   I thought I'd lost you!
belle,Open this door! He's hurt!
belle,My father's not crazy!   Gaston... Tell him!
gaston,"Belle, you know how loyal I am to your family, but your father has been making some unbelievable claims."
jean,"It's true, Belle. He's been raving about a beast in a castle."
belle,I have just come from the castle and there is a beast!
gaston,"We all admire your devotion to your father, but you'd say anything to free him. Your word is hardly proof."
belle,You want proof? SHOW ME THE BEAST!
gaston,This is sorcery!
belle,"No, don't be afraid.    He is gentle and kind."
gaston,"The monster has put her under a spell! If I didn't know better, I'd say she even cared for him."
belle,"He's not a monster, Gaston. You are.  The beast would never hurt anyone."
gaston,"I have heard of the effects of dark magic, but never seen it with my own eyes before! This is a threat to our very existence!"
tom,We're not safe until he's dead
dick,He'll come stalking us at night
jean,Set to sacrifice our children To his monstrous appetite!
clothilde,He'll wreak havoc on our village If we let him wander free!
gaston,"So it's time to take some action, boys It's time to follow me!"
mob,"Light your torch, mount your horse!"
gaston,Screw your courage to the sticking place
mob,We're counting on Gaston to lead the way
lefou,There's a beast Running wild there's no question But I fear The wrong monster's released
mob,"Sally forth, tally ho Grab your sword, grab your bow Praise the Lord and here we go!"
gaston,Show me the castle!
lumire,At least he has finally learned to love.
cogsworth,A lot of good that does us if she doesn't love him in return.
chip,"Did you hear that, mama?    Is it her!? Is she coming back?!"
lumire,Could it be?
cogsworth,"Well, there you go. So much for true love. Man the barricades, and hold fast!"
castle staff,"Hearts ablaze, banners high We go marching into battle -- Unafraid although the danger just increased"
cadenza,Move aside!
mob,"Raise the flag, sing the song Here we come, we're fifty strong And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong Let's kill the beast!"
cogsworth,"Pardon me, master. I'm sorry to disturb you, but --"
mob,Kill the beast!     Kill the beast!
lumire,I know what to do.
mob,Kill the beast!     Kill the beast!
mob,Kill the beast!     Kill the beast!
lefou,Are you not the least bit concerned that this castle might be haunted?
gaston,"Don't lose your nerve, LeFou."
jean,This place seems familiar... like I've been here before...
cadenza,Bravissima!
gaston,"Hello, beast. I am Gaston.    Belle sent me."
gaston,"When we return to the village, you will marry me, and the beast's head will hang on our wall!"
belle,NEVER.
the beast,Belle?
gaston," No. Don't let me go. Please. Don't hurt me, beast. I'll do anything."
the beast,I AM NOT A BEAST.
belle,No!   It's too far!
the beast,You came back.
belle,Of course I came back.   I'll never leave you again.
the beast,I'm afraid it's my turn to leave.
belle,We're together now.   It's going to be fine. You'll see.
the beast,At least I got to see you one last time.
belle,"No... please, no..."
lumire,"It's all right, Cogsworth."
cogsworth,"I... can't... TICK... Lumire, my friend... TOCK... it was an honor to serve with you."
lumire,The honor was mine.
belle," Please, don't leave me.    Come back."
jean,Darling!?
jean,Beatrice!     Chip!   I remember!   I do!
cogsworth,Oh.   DEAR!
plumette,"Lumire, look!"
garderobe,Tale as old as time Tune as old as song Bittersweet and strange Finding you can change Learning you were wrong
