Speaker,Dialogue
caption,"The most powerful ruler in Christendom, Philip of Spain, has sworn to return all Europe to the Catholic faith."
caption,Only England stands in his way: a weak impoverished nation ruled by a woman.
caption,Philip prepares to obey the will 2             of his God.
reston,At last.
hatton,Be warned by the atrocities in France! God-fearing Christians murdered by Papist cut-throats inflamed by hatred of the truth!
howard,We know the Catholics take their orders from Spain. The Spanish speak openly of Mary Stuart as
elizabeth, Mary Stuart is a Queen cast out by her own ungrateful nation.
hatton,"With respect, majesty - a"
elizabeth,"Fear creates fear, sir. I will not punish my people for their beliefs. Only for their deeds. am assured that the people of England love their Queen. My constant endeavour is to earn that love."
bess,"Not too soon, my lady."
bess,I'll want the marriage if I want the man.
walsingham,Austria. France. Sweden. ELIZABETH Why stop there? Turkey has a Sultan. China has an Emperor.  What sort of man do you want? WALSINGHAM I confine myself to the possible. BESS An honest man. With friendly eyes.
bess,And sweet breath.
elizabeth,So that you can kiss him without choking.
walsingham,"They care for your safety, majesty. The threats to your person are real."
elizabeth,"And they know very well that if I fall, they all come tumbling down after me."
elizabeth,"Let's pray, Bess. May we have wisdom not to fear shadows in the night, and courage when the day of danger truly dawns."

elizabeth,Lines round my mouth. Where did they come from?
bess,"Smile lines, my lady. ELIZABETH Smile lines? When do I smile? With that she smiles, and sees Bess's answering reflected smile. ELIZABETH Now you have smile lines too."
may 1 blue draft - p.10," Her smile fades. She gazes at her now naked face, vulnerable in the mirror."
philip,"`Elizabeth! The angels weep for you, Elizabeth! Why do you close your ears to the voice of your loving God?'"
philip,But she did not listen. She made me a speech about the virtues of virginity. Me! Virginity! She has brought this on herself. P hilip surveys the scene through the carriage window with a shudder.
philip,Every tree that falls hurts me. I lose a part of myself. I am cursed with sensitivity. I feel too much.
reston,Your majesty has a merciful soul.
philip,"I sacrifice my country's forests to save the souls of a lost nation. That is true mercy. England is lost to darkness, Father. I bring light."
reston,The light of purifying fire.
reston,"My time has come, majesty.  Send me home."
mary,This is so pretty I'm inclined to send it as a present to my dear cousin Elizabeth. She holds up the delicate work to show her ladies.
annette,My Queen.
mary,Our friends write to give us hope.
annette," Soon England's true believers will rise up against the bastard usurper Elizabeth, and slit her throat, and throw her down to hell."
mary,"That's enough, Annette.  Slit her throat? Please."
annette,"And when the bastard usurper is dead, my lady will be queen."
mary,"See how I pass my time in my lonely prison. PAULET Charming, ma'am. Distractingly charming. She holds the intimate garment against her body. Paulet seems to be too fascinated by it to notice he is being"
savage, The conspiracy gains strength.
crowd,God bless your majesty - God love you! - See her sweet face!
aleigh,"A puddle in the way, majesty."
royal servant,The Queen is at her prayers!
elizabeth,A puddle...
raleigh,She spoke to me. You have to give me that.
calley,"Oh, I do. The Queen spoke to you. One word - but she spoke."
raleigh,Two words.
calley,You're made. A dukedom at the very least.
raleigh,Did you see the girl behind her? I've been at sea too long.
howard,"Here, majesty."
walsingham,We still need to keep France out of the arms of Spain. ELIZABETH Let me think on it.  What if enemy ships should sail up the Thames? Can the docks be closed?
raleigh,And when will he come out?
doorkeeper,"There's no way of knowing that, sir. The doorkeeper stands aside for Bess. She recognises Raleigh, and throws him a smile before rushing past. RALEIGH "
elizabeth,"Late again, Bess."
bess,I beg your majesty's forgiveness.
elizabeth,Given. Once.
bess,"The puddle man is outside, majesty."
elizabeth,My suitors.
elizabeth,"More your age than mine, Bess. How old is he?"
elizabeth,"I become almost enthusiastic. to Hatton) Send for him.  Where is he, then?"
elizabeth, How much longer do you think I can play this game?
walsingham,Virginity is an asset that holds its value well.
lizabeth,Diplomatically speaking.
don guerau,"Majesty, this man is a notorious pirate."
elizabeth,Indeed?
don guerau,"Spanish treasure, stolen from Spanish ships. You will see. R aleigh kneels before the Queen. Elizabeth gestures for him to rise."
elizabeth,"Well, sir. Who are you?"
raleigh,"Walter Raleigh, your majesty."
elizabeth,What do you want?
raleigh,"The honour to be in the presence of my Queen, whose radiant beauty is the boast and glory of the English people."
elizabeth,"Yes, well, here you are."
aleigh,"I'm just returned from the New World, majesty. I have claimed the fertile coast in your name, and called it Virginia, in honour of our Virgin Queen."
elizabeth,Virginia? And if I marry? Will you change the name to Conjugia?
raleigh,"I ask for your gracious permission, majesty, to return to the New World with your royal warrant, to found a colony under the laws and protections of England. E lizabeth's eye has fallen on the native Americans."
elizabeth,Who are they?
raleigh,"Americans, majesty. They long to be your newest subjects."
elizabeth,Have they no ruler of their own?
raleigh,None to match England's Queen.
elizabeth,These gentlemen are welcome. See that they're treated well.
raleigh,"I also come bearing gifts for your majesty, from the New World."
don guerau,"The fruits of piracy, majesty. The true property of the realm of Spain."
elizabeth,"Let's see, shall we? to Raleigh) What do you bring me?"
raleigh,"Mud, and leaves."
elizabeth, Mud and leaves?
raleigh,"Patata, majesty. You eat it. Very nourishing."
aleigh,Tobacco. You breathe its smoke. Very stimulating.
don guerau,"Forgive me, majesty, I find the air has become stale. I am sensitive to the smell of open sewers."
elizabeth, Continue.
raleigh,Gold. You spend it. Very satisfying.
raleigh,"Courtesy of a Spanish ship, that found itself unable to complete its journey."
elizabeth,"The fruits of piracy after all, it seems. RALEIGH Philip of Spain is no friend of England, majesty. The more gold I take from him, the safer you will be."
elizabeth,"Well, well. A political pirate. A logic-chopping pirate."
raleigh,And your majesty's most loyal subject.
elizabeth,"But not my best dressed. W     elcome home, Mr Raleigh."
raleigh,What did you think of her?
calley,Terrifying. RALEIGH But magnificent. He moves on.
margaret,`Mud and leaves'! I nearly died! B ESS `Patata! You eat it!'
margaret,She liked him. I could tell.
bess,"Well, wouldn't you?"
raleigh,"I'm glad to have the opportunity to thank you. Without your help, I'd still be in outer darkness."
bess,"I did very little, sir. You'd already caught the Queen's eye."
raleigh,Then I thank you for the very little.
reston,Who will help him?
savage," Ad te clamamus, exsulaes filii Evae. Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes in hac lacrimarum valle -"
babington,Make your peace with God.
savage,"No, Tom! Don't kill me! I don't want to die!"
reston,"Si ambulam in medio umbrae mortis, non timebo mala -"
servant,"Visitor waiting, sir."
william,Not yet.
walsingham,These are dangerous times to be questioning the ways of God. You must take care of yourself.
william,My needs are simple.
walsingham,You'll dine with us? You'll lodge with us?
mary walsingham,William!
william,Look at you! All grown up.
ursula,William. This is a pleasure.
william,"I've been away too long, ma'am."
mary walsingham,"You come with me, William."
ursula,Have you spoken to the Queen?
walsingham,I speak to her daily.
ursula,You know what I mean. You've done enough. No man could do more.
walsingham,I can't leave court yet. The Queen needs me.
ursula,"So you're to die in harness like a pack horse, are you? And for what?  Mary! William! WALSINGHAM These are difficult times- URSULA It's always difficult times. Mary joins them, her arm in William's. Walsingham seizes the opportunity to change the subject."
mary,"H ere by me, William."
william,"Truth will always hate falsehood, ma'am."
mary,"Why do we have to talk about war? Tell us your nice news, William. Are you married yet?"
william, Not yet.
mary,Then we must find you a nice sensible English wife.
william,"No, no. I won't be staying long. I must go back to my studies."
walsingham,"Not too soon, I hope. Every man deserves a rest."
ursula,"Listen to him! When did you last rest, I'd like to know?  He won't listen to me. Not a thought for his health. You tell him, he's your brother. He'll die at his desk, out of sheer selfishness."
lizabeth,Your highness does me great honour. Shall we eat our dinner? It should prove almost as restorative as my love.
court lady,"So tell me, Mr Raleigh, in your sea battles - how do you sink an enemy ship? You shoot holes in its sides, I suppose."
raleigh,"No, ma'am. A sunk ship is of no value. The object is to capture and command."
court lady,And how do you do that?
raleigh,Surprise. Speed. Irresistible violence.
elizabeth,"I think you're not as accustomed as I am to eating in public. I have a secret. lowering her voice) I pretend there's a pane of glass - eine Glasscheibe - between me and them. S he moves one hand before her face, indicating an imaginary pane of glass. As she looks, she sees Bess staring at someone - follows her gaze - and is amused to find that the object of her attention is also Raleigh."
elizabeth,"They can see me, but they can't hear me, or touch me. You should try it."
elizabeth,Bess.
elizabeth, He interests me. Talk to him.
bess,"Him, my lady?"
elizabeth,Him.
elizabeth,His highness is tired after his journey.
archduke charles,"No man can be tired in the presence of so lovely a Queen. E lizabeth speaks so only he can hear, in German."
elizabeth,"(You play the game very well, my young friend. But don't you"
archduke charles," ELIZABETH (You're thinking, perhaps, that"
bess,"The pirate is not too bored by the vanities of the court, I hope."
raleigh,"A simple sailor, dazzled by the bright lights."
bess,If you can bring yourself to leave the dazzle of the bright lights for a moment -
raleigh,D rawn away by the brightest light of all.
bess,That can only mean the Queen.
raleigh,I don't presume to raise my eyes so high.
bess,It seems you've presumed after all.
raleigh,It seems you're determined to think the worst of me.
bess,Tell me what it is you really want.
raleigh,What every man wants. Money. Fame. Love.
bess,In that order?
raleigh,Each leads to the next. The money will buy and equip ships for a return voyage to the New World. The success of my infant colony there will make me famous. The fame will bring me love.
bess,It seems rather a long way round.
raleigh,"There are benefits along the way. It is something, after all, to take a blank on the map and build there a shining city."
bess,Which you will no doubt name after yourself.
raleigh, No doubt. B
ess,"Well, then. I am answered."
raleigh,May I ask a question in return?
bess,Of course.
raleigh,How am I to win the Queen's favour?
bess,"Why should I tell you that, sir?"
raleigh,"I've little enough to offer, I know. But whatever I have to give - ask, and it's yours."
bess,"My advice to you is, say what you mean to say as plainly as possible. All men flatter the Queen in the hope of advancement. Pay her the compliment of truth."
raleigh,I don't even know your name.
bess,Elizabeth Throckmorton.
raleigh,A second Elizabeth.
bess,"Everyone calls me Bess. S he goes back to the Queen, as Elizabeth is rising to leave. She speaks to the company."
elizabeth,His highness the Archduke informs me that my charms overwhelm him. He will retire to his private quarters to rest.
elizabeth,He's a sweet boy. I don't want him hurt by your schemes.
elizabeth,I suspect him of being a professional charmer. Am I right?
bess,"He is certainly charming, my lady."
elizabeth,There are duller professions. And what is it he hopes to gain by his charms?
bess,He hopes for glory in his New World. He dreams of building a shining city.
mary,Dismissed? On whose orders?
mary,Do stop snivelling.
annette,"The Warden, my lady."
mary,The Warden? My Warden?
mary,"What have you done now, you bad man? Sent away my laundress? How am I to have clean clothes? Or do"
mary,"How am I to send my intimate letters? PAULET Through me. MARY And you will read them. PAULET With respectful admiration. MARY Am I to have no privacy? PAULET No. Beneath the charm, steel. MARY You disappoint me, sir."
mary,"Tormentor! Is that Elizabeth's order too? That you torment and mock me? She turns to go, but stops before leaving the room: bitter, haughty, not deigning to look back. MARY They say she's a beautiful woman."
mary,"My friend, forgive me. You are my friend, are you not? PAULET I am your servant, ma'am, and your admirer."
mary,"I shall send no more letters. I shall stay here quietly, in my prison. With you."
omitted,"30                                                                 30  INT.

Raleigh enters, and this time the door keeper bows, and ushers him through the open doors. Over this we hear Raleigh's voice telling of his adventures: RALEIGH "
hatton,"Majesty, the Archduke and the court are waiting. ELIZABETH  Go on, Mr Raleigh. You were hoping."
raleigh,"At first it's no more than a haze on the horizon, the ghost of a haze, the pure line corrupted. But clouds do that, and storms. So you watch, you watch."
elizabeth,"The Queen lives for her people. You will therefore forgive me, sir, if after much thought and prayer I decline your offer of marriage."
bess,Well? Are you satisfied with the Queen's favour?
raleigh,She listened as if she understood me.
ess,Then I shall expect some gratitude. R
aleigh,What do you want?
elizabeth,Mr. Raleigh.
elizabeth,"I like your immensities. Your ocean is an image of eternity, I think. Such great spaces make us small. Do we discover the New World, Mr Raleigh, or does the New World discover us?"
raleigh,You speak like a true explorer.
elizabeth,"I like you, Mr Raleigh."
raleigh,And I like you.
elizabeth,"You know, of course, that when I like a man, I reward him."
aleigh,I have heard that.
elizabeth,"And what have you to say about it?       R ALEIGH Reward my mission, majesty, not me."
elizabeth,Is the mission not the man? RALEIGH Leave me free to like you in return. That can be my reward.
elizabeth,Go on. RALEIGH I think it must be hard for so great a Queen to know the simple pleasure of being liked for herself.
elizabeth,Now you become dull.
raleigh,Mine!
elizabeth, You have - the stronger horse.
elizabeth,"When I marry, I marry for my country."
throckmorton,The Queen loves you. Speak to her. BESS I cannot betray the Queen.
throckmorton,You are not betraying her. My
lizabeth,"Don't tease me, Mr Raleigh. There's nothing I'd like to do more."
raleigh,So why don't you?
elizabeth,"Alright, then. I will."
elizabeth,See! You lie! You don't want me on your ship at all.  You're a liar! Elizabeth now takes in Bess.
elizabeth,"Would you like to go to sea, Bess?"
elizabeth,"Oh, do they?"
raleigh,"Lock up a hundred men in a space smaller than this room, for months at a time - Men have needs. A beautiful woman like you would drive us all mad."
elizabeth, Men have needs?
elizabeth,"Then let them stay on land and see to their needs.  Mr Raleigh is eager to sail away to his infant colony, Bess. We must persuade him to stay a little longer, mustn't we?"
hrockmorton,Bess?
omitted,44A-B                                                          44A-B
elizabeth,"No, don't stop. I like it."
elizabeth,"Is it true, Bess? That I've never known the simple pleasure of being liked for myself?"
bess,"I hope you believe that I like you for yourself, my lady. ELIZABETH Is anybody ever liked just for themselves? Are you? I doubt it. Men like you because you're pretty. And because you have the ear of the Queen."
bess,"No doubt, my lady."
elizabeth,Him too. He likes you because he wants my favour. You do realise that?
bess,"Yes, my lady."
elizabeth,"And the other thing too, of course. But all men want that. Male desire confers no B         distinction."
lizabeth,"I envy you, Bess. You're free to have - what I can't have. You're my adventurer. Don't be afraid. It's all over so soon."
walsingham,"Still nothing to tell me, Mr Throckmorton?"
walsingham,"I know about the Enterprise. I need names. But if you won't help me, perhaps your father will."
walsingham,"He's been questioned, as you have. I do have to know, you see."
throckmorton,No!
throckmorton,"Enough! You want a name, I'll give you a name."
walsingham,Well?
hatton,As always.
elizabeth,"If she wants my love, let her deserve it. Refused."
elizabeth,Mr Raleigh. I've kept you waiting.
walsingham,Majesty.
elizabeth,"Yes, Walsingham?"
walsingham,"The traitor has talked, majesty. The traitor Throckmorton."
elizabeth," Forgive me, sir. As you see, my time is not my own."
torturer,You'll never guess what I heard -
elizabeth,"What do you know of the Enterprise of England, Ambassador?"
don guerau,"The Enterprise...? Forgive me, your majesty..."
elizabeth,It's a plan for the invasion of my country. Two armies landing on the coasts of Sussex and -
walsingham,Norfolk.
elizabeth,"And Norfolk. Mary Stuart is to be set free, and placed on the English throne."
don guerau,I know nothing of any invasion plans.
elizabeth,"I refer to this plan as the Enterprise of England. It should more accurately be called `la Empresa di Inglaterra', because it's a Spanish plan. The plan of your king, my one-time brother-in- law, Philip II, to attack my country."
elizabeth," You will leave my presence, sir! Go back to Spain! Tell Philip that I don't fear him, or his priests, or his armies. Tell him if he wants to shake his little fist at us, we're ready to give him such a bite he'll wish he'd kept his hands in his pockets."
don guerau,"You see a leaf fall, and you think you know which way the wind blows. But a wind is coming, madam, that will sweep away your pride. H e bows and turns to go. Elizabeth's words blaze after him."
elizabeth,"I too can command the wind, sir. I have a hurricane in me that will strip Spain bare, if you dare to try me!"
elizabeth,What are you staring at? Lower your eyes! I am the Queen!
elizabeth,You ask permission to go.
raleigh,"Yes, majesty. ELIZABETH You plan to return to the New World. To your colony. For two, or three, or four years. RALEIGH If your majesty grants me your royal warrant. ELIZABETH That is a long time. RALEIGH There's nothing left for me to do here. At sea I know what I'm to do, I know the risks, I know the rewards. Here -"
raleigh,Captain of your - !
elizabeth,Kneel.
elizabeth,"Rise, Sir Walter Raleigh."
raleigh,This is too great an honour.
elizabeth,"If it's such an honour, why are you staring at your boots? RALEIGH You know why. He raises his eyes, but he still doesn't look at her. ELIZABETH Now you stare at the wall. Am I so old and hideous that you can't even look me in the face?"
elizabeth,"My friend, forgive me. I'm a vain and foolish woman. At court it's all a game. I like to be admired. I require it. I grow accustomed to it. But it's all - nothing."
babington,"Francis is about to die! We must act!      R ESTON He enters heaven as a soldier returns home victorious from war. BABINGTON Why don't we strike? What's he dying for? Is this part of your plan?  Reston puts his hands on Babington's shoulders and gently but irresistibly forces him down to pray with them. RESTON Lord, be with us as the end approaches."

burton,Morning. Another filthy day on God's stinking earth.
guard,Morning to you.
ellarman,Nothing but beer. Satisfied?
annette,Madame! Madame!
mary, The gentlemen are ready. It will be soon now.
annette,Blessed Mother of God pray for us!
mary,"Bring me pen and paper, Annette. They wait on my reply. Hurry, now, hurry!"
dee,"The alignment of the planets is most unusual this year. Mars is due to take the ascendant three days after the anniversary of your birth - your majesty was born on September 7th - and I see that twelve days before the anniversary of your birth - He transfers his attention to a different, astronomical chart."
dee,- there will be a full moon - the moon which -
dee,- governs the fortunes of all princes of the female gender.
elizabeth,Princes of the female gender.
dee,"I mean to say, a prince who is also a woman."
elizabeth,"Yes, Dr Dee. I am following you. So what does it all mean? D EE It means the rise of a great empire, majesty. And it means convulsions, also. The fall of an empire."
elizabeth,"Which empire is to rise, and which is to fall?"
dee,"That I can't say. Astrology is, as yet, more an art than a science."
walsingham,"Nothing more, Dr Dee? No more specific calamities that we can guard against?"
elizabeth,"He means, Will I be assassinated?"
walsingham,Queens are mortal.
dee,Elizabeth is mortal. The Queen will never die.
elizabeth,"You see, Francis? This is a mystery.  He has no patience with mysteries. W"
alsingham,"What I don't know, I can't use."
dee,And yet mysteries have power. Have you not learned that?
elizabeth,Francis. Leave us for a moment.
elizabeth,"And the private life of this prince of the female gender, Dr Dee? What do the stars foretell there? Or is this too a mystery?"
dee,"These are matters of state, majesty."
elizabeth,Do the stars not foretell matters of state?
dee,"For such a prediction, I must look in a different chart."
dee,"Wonderful... Out of such suffering, to have forged such strength... You will need all your strength in days to come... And love... So much love..."
dee,"But I'm no prophet. I see no more than the shadows of ghosts. ELIZABETH An art, not a science. I understand."
reston,You have it?
reston,What do you think? There must be
reston,We wait on a direct order. He completes the note and gives it to Burton.
reston,"One more journey, my friend. Then -  consummatum est! It is finished."
bess,"Please! I'm innocent! I've always been a loyal servant of the Queen. I'd never betray the Queen, never -"
walsingham,"But you have, my dear. And you do. We both know that."
walsingham,"Keep me informed, and all will be well. I don't like surprises."
ancing master," When I push like this, my lady, give a jump into the air."
elizabeth,"Let him throw you round, Bess. You can trust him."
dancing master,And round - and round - and round - and down!
lizabeth,"L a Volta, Mr Raleigh. The jump. I require all my ladies to learn it. You see how fearless Bess is."
raleigh,You like your ladies to jump at your command?
elizabeth,Sometimes. Do you think that wrong?
raleigh,"No, no. You're the Queen. You are to be obeyed."
elizabeth,"To tell you the truth, Mr Raleigh, there are times when I'm tired of being always in control."
raleigh,Nonsense.
elizabeth,What?
raleigh,You don't mean a word of it. You eat and drink control.
elizabeth,Do you say so?
elizabeth,"Bess, you must try a dance with Mr Raleigh. He's eager to show us his skill."
raleigh,"No skill at all, majesty. I don't know the steps."
elizabeth,"Oh, it's very simple."
elizabeth,"You stand like this, with your hands firmly clasped here - and when she jumps, on the eighth step, you swing her round - once, twice, three times - and you're back to the beginning. What could be simpler?"
dancing master,Your majesty knows the dance better than I.
elizabeth,"So come, Mr Raleigh. Take your position. I am to be obeyed."
raleigh,As your majesty wishes.
elizabeth,Hold her tight. I don't want her dropped.  Play!
elizabeth," Leave her alone, Walsingham. I want both of them left alone."
ary,"Am I a danger to England even when I pray? P AULET As always, ma'am, my concern is for your safety."
mary,I pray for my cousin Elizabeth. Do you think she prays for me?
reston,"`If our forces are in readiness, both within and without the realm, then your Queen commands you to set the gentlemen to work.'"
william," This is the spark that will set England ablaze. Reston takes out pistols, and hands one to Ramsay, one to Babington.           R ESTON We've been patient long enough. Let God's work begin."
william,It's me. William.
walsingham, Where have you been? We haven't seen you for days.
william,I met up with some old friends.
walsingham,"From Paris, no doubt."
william,Yes.
walsingham,And now you've come back.
walsingham,"Do you know, I can still remember the day you were born?"
walsingham,"I was eleven years old. And you, this helpless bundle. I looked at you in your crib, with your little wrinkled face, and I loved you from the first. I vowed then to look after you. I watched you grow up with your head in the clouds, always a dreamer. I couldn't follow you there. And now I've failed you, haven't I? Forgive me if I haven't loved you enough."
walsingham,Did you really think I didn't know?
walsingham,Was it for money? At least tell me you got a good price. W illiam shakes his head.
walsingham,What then? What would you murder your own brother for?
william, Eternal life.
walsingham,Eternal life. The bribe no man can refuse.
royal servant,The Queen is at her prayers! T he chapel doors begin to close.
babington,Now!
ramsay,God for Mary! England's true Queen!
babington,Elizabeth!
mary,You bring news?
paulet,The Queen has been attacked -
mary,Yes?
paulet,The assassin seized -
mary,Yes?
paulet,The Queen unharmed -
mary,Unharmed?
paulet,"And you, ma'am, are under arrest."
mary,Me? What has any of this to do with me?
paulet,"My own invention. Theatrical, but effective. My master has every letter you've written."
mary,Your master?
paulet,Walsingham.
mary,Traitors. I'm surrounded by traitors. Who am I to trust?
mary,Only my little one...
walsingham,"Ready to die, I see, Jesuit."
reston,I have done what I was sent to do.
walsingham,Why was the gun not loaded?
william,To kill the Queen. You know it. You know everything.
walsingham,Not quite everything.
william,"I've told you all I know. Go ahead and kill me. Take what's left of me. I don't care any more. All my life you've had everything and I've had nothing. So finish it. There's a better world waiting for me. We'll all be judged in the end, brother. Even you."
walsingham,You're no martyr. You weren't even much of a murderer. Go back to France. Back to your dreams. Never let me hear of you again.
reston,Send me home.
elizabeth,"They say she's taller than me. Her hair is chestnut in colour. Her eyes are hazel. They say she's beautiful. But people lie. They say I am beautiful. A dismissive shrug. Clearly she does not think herself beautiful. BESS She plotted to kill you. ELIZABETH Yes, it's true. I've read her letters. I too was a prisoner"
mary,"Who are you to sit in judgement on me? By what authority do you condemn a Queen? God alone has made me what I am. He is my only judge. Raise your law above God's law, and what law remains? In your vanity and ignorance you set loose the monster of misrule. You know neither who you are nor what you do. But I know who I am. I die as I have lived - trusting in the mercy of my God - a Queen. 8"
elizabeth,Must die? Mary Stuart must die? Where is it written? Who dares to
alsingham,"Majesty, this is no time for mercy -"
elizabeth,"Don't preach at me, old man. Look at you! You can hardly stand. Go home to your wife. Go home to your bed."
walsingham,The law must have its way.
elizabeth,"The law is for common men, not for princes."
bess,Thank God you've come. I've never seen her so distressed. She's been alone in her rooms since morning. She'll see no one.
raleigh,Has she asked for me?
bess,No. But she needs you. I know she does.
ess,Go to her.
raleigh,My Queen.
elizabeth,My friend.
elizabeth,My duty? Was it my father's duty to murder my mother? I would be
raleigh,Since when were you so afraid?
elizabeth,"Yes, I am afraid. I am always afraid."
raleigh,You fear your soul will be touched. Royalty is close to immortality. Kill a Queen - and queens are mortal.
elizabeth,You understand me well.
raleigh,"We mortals have many weaknesses. We feel too much. Hurt too much. And all too soon, we die. But we do have the chance of love."
elizabeth,Do we? Do we really?
mary,Your face tells me. It's decided.
paulet,Tomorrow morning. At eight.
mary,Please don't cry.

walsingham,Philip of Spain is a God-fearing man. He cannot make war without just cause. He sent the Jesuit to kill a Queen. But not you.
elizabeth,Not me!
walsingham,The Jesuit's mission was to draw Mary Stuart into the murder plot. He knew I was reading her every letter. He waited until she wrote the words that sealed her guilt.
elizabeth, And I ordered her execution. I murdered God's anointed Queen. And now God's most dutiful son makes holy war to punish me.
walsingham,"Forgive me, majesty. Let me go."
archbishop,"Exurge, domine et vindica causam tuam. Amen."
elizabeth,Boethius.
raleigh,The Consolation of Philosophy.
elizabeth,Thank you for coming at this late hour.
elizabeth,We're at war. Who knows when we'll meet again. If we'll meet again.
raleigh,May the Lord God preserve England's Queen.
elizabeth,"The same God in whose name Philip wages his holy war. Philip is a righteous man, and righteous men love to destroy. They burn whole worlds to make them pure, and leave behind - ashes."
raleigh,He'll not burn England.
elizabeth,"He may. His Armada is invincible, they say. If London falls, I fall. If England is lost, I am lost."
raleigh,Never!
elizabeth,"Never? It's night. My thoughts turn dark. Don't you ever think that one day, perhaps one day soon, you too will die?"
raleigh,"The closer I come to death, the more I want to live. The hungrier I am for life."
raleigh,"Why be afraid of tomorrow? Today's all we have, and all we know."
elizabeth,Today. Tonight.
raleigh,Now.
elizabeth,I wish -
raleigh,I've never known a woman like you.
elizabeth,"In some other time, in some other world, could you have loved me?"
raleigh,"I know only one world. In this world, I have loved you."
elizabeth,Then there's... something you could do for me - something I've not known for a very long time - if you felt so inclined -
elizabeth,A kiss?
bess,I'll be quick. I have something to tell you. But I ask for nothing. Is that understood? Your life is your own. Nothing will change.
raleigh,"What is this, Bess?"
bess,I'm -
raleigh,You're pregnant?
bess,No one knows. My plans are made. I shall ask the Queen for permission to leave court. I shall live quietly in the country with - with my child. The Queen must know nothing.
aleigh,Where will you go?
bess,To my mother's house.
bess,I'm a ward of the Queen. I can't court a man without her permission. I can't marry without her permission. As for having a child -
raleigh,When were you planning to leave? BESS As soon as I'm allowed.
raleigh,Am I not to see you again? What's to become of the child? Bess -
bess,Hush! We've no choice. You know it as well as I do.
raleigh,All I know is nothing's as it should be.
bess,"Please listen. You once said to me, `Whatever I have to give, ask and it's yours.' Do you remember?"
raleigh,Of course I remember.
bess,"I ask that you forget me. Go to your ship. Do your duty. Forget me. R aleigh gazes at her, deeply moved."
raleigh,"Oh, Bess..."

hatton,"We have three, possibly four thousand, majesty. WALSINGHAM If the Spanish fleet reaches Calais in strength, the combined armies will be beyond our power to resist."
lizabeth,"Therefore, the Spanish fleet must not reach Calais."
howard,"Majesty, this vast Armada will surely smash through our naval defences. We must be prepared for the worst."
walsingham,"How did you know about the numbers of the Dutch barges, majesty? I don't recall supplying you with that information."
elizabeth,"You may observe, Walsingham, that I don't see my way with only one eye. Nor do I hop along on only one leg. Why then would I rely on only one source of information?"
lizabeth,Where's Bess?
bess,"Here, my lady!"
elizabeth,You traitress! You dare to have secrets from me! I am your Queen! You ask my permission before you rut - before you marry - before you breed! My bitches wear my collars! Do you hear me? How dare you be with child!
walsingham,"Majesty, please! Dignity - mercy -"
elizabeth,"This is no time for mercy! That's what you said to me. I don't forget. But you showed mercy, Walsingham! Go to your traitor brother, and leave me to my business! W alsingham turns white. Elizabeth is back berating Bess."
elizabeth,Is it his child? Tell me! Say it! Is the child his? Tell me! Say it! Is it his?
bess,"Yes, my lady. It is - my husband's child."
raleigh,This is not the Queen I love and serve.
elizabeth,This gentleman has seduced a lady under my care. This lady has married without my consent. These are offences punishable by law.  Arrest him.

elizabeth,I will not be a toy of the fates! Have I not faced an assassin's bullet and lived?
dee,"The forces that shape the world are greater than all of us, majesty. How can I promise you that they'll conspire in your favour, even though you are the Queen? But this much I know. When the storm breaks, each man acts in accordance with his own nature. Some are dumb with terror. Some flee. Some hide. And some spread their wings like eagles and soar on the wind."
