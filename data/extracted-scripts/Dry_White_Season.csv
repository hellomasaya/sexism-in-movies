ben," You did son. Come on, shower."
ben,"I'll be expecting you. There isn't much to do, only weeding the marigolds and watering the lawn and flowers."
ben,"And how's the algebra?   Still giving you trouble? JONATHAN  Just a little, Mr. Ben'sir. JOHAN Me too."
gordon," He's working hard, Mr. Ben'sir, and your money will not be wasted. Emily and me will always thank you."
ben," See you both later. Gordon returns to his work a little distance further. A group of students are laughing and pushing each other boisterously. As they near Jonathan, two nudge each other and giggle. Then, one of them trips Jonathan. He falls to the ground and jumps up aggressively, about to attack the boy. Gordon shouts ""Jonathan."" The headmaster, MRS. CLOETE, aged 65 years, has observed the incident, but takes no action."
leader,Your children are starving and you are drinking. We demand freedom and our fathers are drunk. We ask you to boycott these beer halls. Revolution and drink don't work together!
ben,"I wondered why he wasn't at school. Would it help if I came to see him? He's always seemed a good kid to me. MRS. COETZEE Oh, would you? BEN Of course. I'll phone and we can fix a time."
ben,She's having trouble with her boy. He won't come to school.
susan,So you said you'd have a word with him?
ben,Yes! She smiles and walks him to the car affectionately. EXT. BEN'S HOUSE - BARBECUE - DAY The Du Toit family.
ben,Gordon!   What are you doing here?
ben,"What about the court?    Didn't he state his case? GORDON What does he know about court? Before he knew, it was all over. BEN I don't think there is anything we can do about it now. Outside, peering     through the half-opened door, is Johan, shocked at what     he sees. Ben tapes Jonathan on the head, he pulls up his     shorts painfully, yet fiercely, anxious to cover himself     up again. GORDON We can get a lawyer to appeal. BEN A lawyer? That won't heal Jonathan's buttocks. Susan appears at the door."
susan,Ben! BEN I'll be out in a minute.
ben,"Johan, get some iodine from the cupboard."
susan,"Trouble? BEN Jonathan has been caned, by the police. She places the boerwors and the beer before him."
students,'If we learn Afrikaans vorster must learn Zulu.' 'Bantu education! Stinks! Stinks! Stinks!' 'Equal education! Now! Now! Now!' They also start singing a freedom song.
girl,"Shoot me!   Come on, shoot me! Shoot me! "
large woman,Men of today only like looking. Laughter in the carriage.    Gordon is also enjoying the joke.
13.,CONTINUED: There is more laughter.
gordon," Yes, baba, with Wellington. INT. SOWETO POLICE STATION - DAY Black parents, waiting. At the counter with Gordon, a large black man, STANLEY, a friend -- his big easy smile is working hard on a white policeman, the station SERGEANT VAN ZYL, about to run out of patience. STANLEY No, no, I understand, Baas, but is that all the names? There's no other list somewhere?"
stanley,"But, what about John Voster Square? "
stanley,Thank you.
stanley,"You're here too, sis Paulina, who are you looking for?"
woman,They picked up my girl -- 13-year- old girl!
stanley, We are all searching. The policeman calls her -- she hurries to the counter. CUT TO:
gordon,"You're a lawyer, Julius! STANLEY  A black lawyer! Those Boers... the bastards'll kick him around till they lose him."
emily,"What about the Baas? If he asks, they will give him an answer."
gordon, When the boy was flogged he didn't help. Why should he help him now?
johan,"Hi, Gordon. No response.   Ben does a double-take and stops playing. BEN  Hold it, champ. He crosses the yard to Gordon, fluffing his hair dry, Johan follows behind."
ben,"Gordon, you okay? No response again. Gordon continues to work.     Ben and Johan exchange puzzled looks. JOHAN Isn't this Jonathan's day to help you? BEN How is he, recovering?"
gordon,"I don't know, Mister Ben, sir -- the police took him. BEN Again?"
johan,What for?
ben,Okay!   I'll see what I can find out.
lewinson,Ngubene -- Jonathan Ngubene. INT. LEWINSON'S OFFICE - DAY
superintendent,It's preposterous. I would have known -- of such a case... I mean... in my hospital. You people! You're always raking up trouble! J) STANLEY
lewinson,... Freda -- I said no calls... Oh... Right... put them through. Hallo! Yes! How are you?... that is correct.
lewinson," Sorry. He dials a number. INT. DAN PIENAAR SCHOOL - STAFF ROOM - DAY Tea break for the teachers, Ben       among them. He is enjoy- ing a laugh with his colleagues       -- maybe in Afrikaans -- we should hear the language here       where we need not com- prehend. An African serves the        tea. There's a KNOCK -- a monitor comes in and talks to Ben who follows him outside. INT. SCHOOL - DAY Ben at the phone."
ben,"Hello, Dan... No... it's all right..."
ben,"It's a terrible thing, Gordon -- God knows I'm sorry. But you have other children to live for... I'll help them too with their schooling. "
gordon,That's what  they say. But I got to know for  certain. How can I have peace?   I must know how my son died and  where they buried him.
cut to:,EXT. CAR PARK
cloete,Just don't get too close. Teachers must stay out of politics. Love to Susan!
emily,"Oh, no... oh no, Lord. Gordon hurries to embrace her."
emily, Please don't tell me...
boy," Baba, I heard you're looking for Wellington. He's out, Baba."
stanley,Where is he?   Where is he? BOY He's with some boys at Dube's shop. STANLEY Thank you very much. You've worked like a man.  Let's go.
stanley,What happened... Don't tell me...
gordon,Did they do that to you? 
gordon, I want to know what happened to Jonathan.
wellington,Isn't he out yet?  I last saw him weeks ago. STANLEY Jonathan is dead.
gordon,"I have to know how he died. INT. BEN'S DINING ROOM Sizette and   Chris with the family at dinner. Suzette is passed the   Rand Daily Mail newspaper by Chris, folded at an article   headlined: ""WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO JONATHAN NGUBENE?""    by Melanie Bruwer. SUSAN Isn't that tragic? Jonathan was such a nice boy. Even played with my Johan when they were small, God. BEN And he was such a nice boy, well- mannered. SUSAN You said he was very bright at school. Chris helps himself to more.     Suzette looks at the paper."
suzette,"Well, this kind of journalism doesn't help the situation. Look at her face? What does she look like? CHRIS The Rand Daily Mail always exaggerates."
suzette,Pardon?
johan,"The work, who'd do it? SUSAN You for a start. Come on!    Help me clear these dishes. As Johan stands, to clear the table. He turns to his father with a smile, and shrugs -- an irritated Suzette joins them."
gordon,'On the second day of our detention at John Vorster Square we were taken to one of the top floors. We were ordered to undress and they started to beat us with fists and sjamboks. This for a long time.'
stolz," On your feet! So, you must be Gordon Ngubene?"
ben,"Jeezus -- Jeezus -- Jeezus Christ. JOHAN Good night, Papa!"
johan,"Oh, Papa! Susan appears at the door with a cup of coffee. She's had a bath -- her hair is wet -- and she's in her housecoat. Ben and Johan don't notice her approach."
ben,"Yes, son.   Go and get some sleep. The boy nods and leaves."
ben,"I will, in a minute. I'll just put the thoughts of Standar Six away. They mustn't be lost to posterity. "
ben," All right, time up! Hand in your test. Moans from the students."
ben,"Don't worry too much, Emily, I'm sure Gordon will be home in a few days."
stolz,"Come on, Kaffir, talk! GORDON Please, I've done nothing.   All I tried to do was to find... Stolz interrupts him with a blow to his face.    As Gordon drops his hands, the officer shouts to him."
lieutenant venter,Up with those bloody arms! STOLZ We don't like gramophone records here! Now who has been giving you informations?
stolz,All right.
cut to:,INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS  - DAY
stolz, Come on you bloody black bastard. Who has been telling you lies?
stolz," I'll be down immediately, Colonel. CUT TO:"
ben,"Nice to meet you, Colonel Viljoen."
viljoen,I used to watch you play for the Transvaal. You were one of the great wing forwards. BEN  Long time ago.
viljoen, Do sit down.
viljoen,"All right now, Gordon Ngubene."
viljoen, I'm always grateful for that.
ben,I thought there might have been some kind of misunderstanding I could help straighten out.
viljoen,Like what?
ben,"I know him, Colonel. He works at my school. He's done work for me too. VILJOEN And you feel you know him enough to vouch for him."
ben,"Yes, after so many years... 10 years. Gordon's not the type to get himself in trouble. He's an honest, hard-working, church- going man. VILJOEN Ha! You'd be surprised how many honest, decent, church-going men we come across during a working day."
ben,I appreciate that -- but Gordon would never... VILJOEN 
ben,"Colonel -- believe me, I'm with you all the way. But in this case -- I'm sure that in your worthy pursuit of the guilty you have, unwittingly, involved the innocent. After all, we're all human. We all make mistakes sometimes. Viljoen laughs again. VILJOEN We are indeed, Mr. Du Toit -- we are indeed. Though there's many who might need persuading as to that fact. Then... authority. VILJOEN Mr. Du Toit. While you're here, would you mind if I asked you a few questions about Ngubene? BEN  Colonel, I'd welcome it. VILJOEN Good!"
viljoen,Shall we start with his son? 
viljoen,The eldest.
ben,Yes.   He died some time ago. Viljoen doesn't react.
viljoen,What do you know about Gordon's activities since Jonathan's death?
ben,"Nothing, Colonel. VILJOEN Did Gordon ever discuss the death with you?"
ben,Of course he did -- he was upset. The Colonel pauses.
viljoen,But he accepted the truth? BEN He is a religious man... in the end he would have resigned himself to it.
viljoen,Would have? You mean he didn't? Was he angry? Rebellious?
ben,"Come on, Colonel! If one of your kids died...  ... and nobody would tell you how it happened or where his body is buried, wouldn't you be upset?"
stolz,"We told him how his son died, Mr. Du Toit. "
viljoen,"You have a son, Mr. Du Toit? The Colonel looks up at him... the first sign of steel in his eyes... then back to the papers."
viljoen,"... As soon as we're satisfied he's innocent, he will be released. We know what we're doing, Mr. Du Toit. You want your wife and that boy of yours to sleep safe tonight, don't you? "
ben,"One last favor, Colonel? VILJOEN Fire away!"
ben,"Gordon's wife -- she's very worried. May she bring him some food and a change of clothes while he's still here? VILJOEN No problem!    Thank you for your help... BEN Thank you.    I'll rely on you, then. VILJOEN Will you find your way out?"
ben,I think so. And thanks.    I feel much happier now. VILJOEN Good! And give my regards to your father-in-law -- tell him we'll have a drink sometime -- maybe go to a game.
ben,I will.   Goodbye.
viljoen, Is the little bird singing yet?
stolz,I'm working on it. VILJOEN Good.
susan,Champion of political detainees!
ben,"That's right. SUZETTE  My God. What on earth for? Susan leaves the kitchen without a word, with the dessert plates on the tray to the dining room."
ben,"Of course it is. I went down there, told them. They're looking into it. SUZETTE Went down where?"
ben,John Vorster Square.
suzette,You old devil you. Does Ma know?
ben,No. And you're not going to tell her. 
suzette,"Be careful. I don't want my favorite Papa in trouble, Gordon or no Gordon."
ben,More wine?   Viviers?
viviers,"Not for me, Oom Ben. I'm drunk enough. BEN Mrs. Cloete? MRS. CLOETE Please! Ben serves her. Susan passes to fetch milk jug and sugar basin from the chine cupboard. MRS. CLOETE  Oh, I saw those sheets you liked, Sally, on sale at Bloom's. MRS. BESTER Will you be free on Wednesday afternoon? I have one or two other things to buy. INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT"
susan, Come in.
ben,"It's all right. Viviers returns to his seat as Ben shuts the door behind him. BEN Oh, it's you... hum... Stanley, isn't it?  That's all right, darling."
lewinson,"A Friday night, man! I'm no doctor, I'm not on standby all the bloody time. Can't they wait 'til Monday?"
lewinson," Okay, Dan, I'm sorry for disturbing your weekend. Ben replaces the phone.    Turns to Emily and Stanley. BEN He agrees to see you tomorrow and will apply to the supreme court for an interdict to stop any assaults on Gordon. And, we'll find out what's going on. STANLEY You're all right, Lanie. Ben can just hear Emily's soft voice."
emily,"Thank you, Baas. STANLEY Come on, sisi. Tomorrow it'll all be first-class again."
cloete,Blacks lead double lives. One you see and one you don't. These people surprise you all the time. VIVIERS  And a hard worker too. CLOETE A hard worker? I had to get rid of him. Susan doesn't react.   She leaves to join the womens' group. BEN What?
cloete,I fired him a few days before he was arrested for staying away from work for days. And for the sake of the school I say good riddance.
ben,What do you mean 'good riddance'?
cloete,"I have a responsibility for the children. These are troubled times, Ben, we can't trust the natives any more. BESTER You have to be extra careful about any influences, Oom Ben. Even their churches are breeding grounds for all sorts of evil ideas."
ben,Gordon's not subversive and definitely not a Communist.
cloete,"Then he's got nothing to worry about! VIVIERS Except his three teeth. Our government mustn't allow such things to happen. After all, it's a Christian government.  What do you say, Dominee? Bester doesn't answer."
ben," I'm not talking about the government! I believe in our government, damn it... His sharp tone surprises everybody.    He quiets."
ben,"... Look, I know the police often know more than we do. I'm not questioning that. I'm as loyal as the next man. But I do know Gordon Ngubene... there is something wrong."
ben,Dominee? Bester shakes his hand.
bester,Nee Dankie. Ben hands the glass to Viviers.
stolz,How do you feel today?   Ready to fly?
stolz, Water! As Johannes is fetching the bucket of water.        Venter goes to the cupboard and stays there.
lieutenant venter,"'Samson' is ready, Captain, shall I switch him on?"
stolz, Okay.   Gert! Gordon is given a short burst of electric shock.
gordon, Hai!
stolz,"... Kom! A black policeman in uniform.       JOHNSON SEROKE, enters with a letter in his hand."
stolz,What do you want?
seroke,"A letter for you, Captain. Stolz goes to take the letter and turns to place it on his desk. He notices Seroke still standing. STOLZ What are you bloody-well waiting for? SEROKE No reply, Captain? STOLZ Get out of here. Seroke leaves. STOLZ  Now about these affidavits who told you to collect them? The A.N.C.? Who recruited you? Gordon mumbles something."
stolz,"What? He bends forward to hear, and Gordon's swollen, puffy eyes hold his gaze."
gordon,I don't know anything about the A.N.C.
stolz,You've had your chance.    Now you're going to shit. 
gordon,Hai!   Hai!   Hai! INT. DUTCH REFORM CHURCH - MORNING
bester,... So shall the Afrikaner people flourish.
susan,"Why didn't you tell me you'd been down to John Vorster Square? BEN What difference would it have made? SUSAN I'm your wife, damn it!"
ben, ... If I'd been more ambitious.
susan,"He's the gardener for God's sake, not one of the family. BEN Be patient with me... When Gordon is free you'll have me all to yourself again... promise."
susan, Ben.    We're growing old.
ben,"Nonsense. One's as old as he feels. I feel young and very attractive. I can still do my duty. She smiles up at him, chuckles, and then they kiss."
susan, _______________________________
johan,"Stanley's here, Papa."
susan,"Oh, bloody hell!"
ben,"What? The news leaves Ben speechless.      Stanley continues in flat, emotionless tones. STANLEY The bastards say he committed suicide... hanged himself."
stanley,Gordon wasn't a coward. 
stanley," What do you mean 'but'? What about Timol who they said had jumped from a top-floor window? What about Ngudle? What about Mosala? Joyi? Malele? They all died in that John Vorster Square. All suicide, eh? Ben stares at him. There is something like a strange silence between them. Ben is confused and Stanley is staring at him. Ben breaks this embarrassing mood."
ben,"Anything I can do to help? STANLEY He's got brothers. BEN  That's the African way. BEN Stanley, I'd like to see Gordon. STANLEY Don't look for trouble, man. You know there are riots all over Soweto. You're out of it. Why don't you stay out?"
ben,Don't you understand?   I've got to go.
stanley," You got to go? Of course, Lanie... the last farewell. But we have to be careful."
58.,CONTINUED: STANLEY We expected it.
ben,"How can you talk like that!? STANLEY A guy gets picked up by the S.B... he's part of history, man. BEN You mean you had no hope, you didn't believe he'd be released? STANLEY Hope's a white word, Lanie... It's not hope we need."
stanley,What? BEN I was fourteen before I wore shoes -- except for church... I grew up on a plaas miles from any town... watching sheep and... STANLEY 
stanley, But watch out for the police and army. They're patrolling all the time.
stanley," Hurry up, Lanie."
ben's pov,"A modern funeral parlor with its name painted on the side: ""MOROKA FUNERAL DIRECTOR  LTD."""
stanley," No sweets today. I'm sorry, babies. The children give Stanley a coy disbelieving look as they watch him go with the ""white man."""
children's pov,"On the doorstep of the funeral parlor: Stanley and Ben run into a young woman coming out with a shoulder bag and a camera. The young woman and Stanley exchange a quick, friendly greeting -- it's MELANIE BRUWER, the Rand Daily reporter -- and keep moving. BACK TO SCENE"
stanley,What are your thoughts now? BEN What do you mean?
stanley," I... I cannot think.   I'm confused. STANLEY You either believe what you saw or maybe you still prefer the government version. BEN For Christ sake, just get off my back, Stanley. STANLEY Okay.   It was a simple question. Stanley turns his RADIO ON and BANTU MUSIC invades the car as it speeds away in a cloud of dust. EXT. WHITE SUBURB STREET - LATE AFTERNOON The big brassy Dodge is threading its way through the leafy calm of the white suburb."
stanley,"You know, Lanie, when you run a taxi, especially a pirate taxi like me, you have eyes and ears everywhere. Even when a policeman farts in his bed you know. People want a reference book, a permit to stay in Soweto, a house, anything, we taxi drivers know the routes. I'll tell you something..."
ben,What?
stanley,Dr. Hassiem has been picked up. BEN Who's he?
stanley,Dr. Hassiem is the doctor we got to represent Emily at Gordon's autopsy. We wanted the truth. Ben suddenly realizes the significances.
ben,"He would have testified.   Bloody hell! STANLEY A smart move by your Boer brothers. They have silenced Hassiem. BEN His report has to be important. We can only use what we have. Therefore, Lewinson must get a very good advocate.  If only we could get   hold of this Hassiem's report."
stanley,"What's the use? It's one big game and we blacks are merely spectators. Hey Lanie, can one be a spectator as he's being kicked around? He laughs."
stanley," That's what you all say. I have to move man. Your neighbors! Now, be careful. They will put their marks on you! BEN Who?"
ben,"Now tomorrow at ten... STANLEY  Sharp! At our smart liberal friend's office, yeh!"
ben,Good night. Stanley drives vigorously away.
susan,"Ben, you're not a doctor. His death was announced officially. They wouldn't say anything unless they were certain of their facts."
ben," Ben, I'm sorry about Gordon's death, but please for all our sakes, forget about this whole thing. Let's get back to a normal life. BEN Can I have a drink?"
johan,A brandy?
ben,You always know what I need. Johan hurries into the house.
susan," Please, Ben, I'm frightened."
emily,"Well, thank you, Mr. Ben, sir. Eh, that's father Masonwane, our priest, and that's Margaret from next door."
emily," Yes, it's good. What I want to know is why did they kill him. He didn't do them nothing. You know, Mr. Ben, sir, I washed his whole body for he was my husband. And I know a man who killed himself, he doesn't look like that."
margaret,"Master, you must understand she's still raw inside. BEN I'm sure. Robert walks in, looks at Ben and walks into his bedroom to fetch something, then as he's about to go out: EMILY Robert, where are you manners today? Don't you greet visitors? Robert stops momentarily and looks at Ben with hostility and hurries out of the room banging the door."
emily,I'm sorry for his rudeness. PRIEST 
ben,"Emily, I have really come to assure you that I will do all I can to help you find out what really happened to Jonathan and your husband -- we cannot bring them back to life, but we can make sure that this sort of thing won't ever happen again."
priest,"You mean well, sir, but it's better to forgive. If we keep the pain alive then hate and bitterness will remain with us. BEN The air must be cleared.   So we can breathe again. PRIEST The air can only be cleared if we forget about yesterday's thunder. EMILY Mr. Ben is right. It's not that I want to go on with this thing because it's a bad thing that Jonathan died, that Gordon died that's hard enough to bear, but I can forgive it. But they covered Gordon's name with dirt and we must clean it up, else he'll never have peace in his grave."
priest,Those people who did it are sinful people who don't know what they're doing.
stanley,"He! Mfundisi, what are you saying now? You mean..."
priest,"We must help them. That's the only way. They need our help, not hate, but love. PRIEST I pity them and I ask the Lord to help me so I can learn to love them. STANLEY If that's what you preach in your church you will soon be starving."
emily,They covered his name with dirt. PRIEST Aren't you afraid sis Emily? EMILY No. In the end one grows tired of being afraid. STANLEY Amen!
ben,"Emily, Stanley and I will do all we can. As I said we have a good advocate. Everyone involved with Gordon's death will be questioned and all that's known regarding what happened in John Vorster Square will come out."
ben,Lawyers ask questions. MARGARET And don't policemen lie?
emily,"Thank you, Mr. Ben, sir for what you're doing."
ben," Wait, let me check the situation. He opens the door and walks out. EXT. EMILY'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON"
stanley,"Okay. Kids, time to go home.   Be careful."
boy," Sure 'bra' Stanley. Take it easy. Stanley drives off at speed. EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF SOWETO - LATE AFTERNOON Stanley is driving, they have left Soweto.       Ben still on the floor. BEN Are we still in Soweto?"
stanley,"Why don't you look for yourself? Ben rises and sees that they're at least a mile out.       He is not amused. BEN  You will not understand, Lanie. They drive off."
ben,"No, I expected that. But listening to them talk made me realize that I did not know the blacks. Now I question my attitudes, my concerns as Ben, and complacence as a white person."
susan,"Ben, I know your anxiety about the inquest. All will be cleared up, in a legal way, and you'll be back to your normal self. Now let's turn off the lights. Susan kisses Ben tenderly. INT. COURT ROOM - FIRST DAY OF INQUEST - DAY The inquest of Gordon Ngubene... conducted by MAGISTRATE KLOPPER. In the witness box is DR. JANSEN, the state pathologist, giving evidence. Advocate DE VILLIERS is cross examining. DE VILLIERS Dr. Jansen, you are a state pathologist of many years standing and I have no doubt a well-qualified pathologist. Could you now please tell us what caused the death of the deceased? DR. JANSEN I found that death had been caused by the application of force to the neck, consistent with hanging."
de villiers,"You are sure about the hanging? This pressure on the neck, could it also have been exerted in other ways? DR. JANSEN It could, but it is not for me to speculate. DE VILLIERS Of course not, Doctor. The list of injuries found on the body was horrifyingly long; bruises, swellings, abrasions, broken rib, lacerations, etc. How long before death do you estimate he received these injuries? DR. JANSEN I couldn't say exactly."
de villiers,Roughly.
de villiers,Even more recent. I see. I understand you had a Dr. Hassiem present at the autopsy.
cut to:,"DR. HERZOG the police physician, giving evidence. DE VILLIERS Dr. Herzog, did you examine the deceased? DR. HERZOG Yes, one day Captain Stolz called me in. The man had toothache. DE VILLIERS  That's all?"
de villiers,Did the captain or anyone else assist you during the examination?
louw," I protest, Your Worship."
magistrate,"Advocate De Villiers, will you refrain from insinuations?"
de villiers,"Thank you, Doctor Herzog... I'm sure Gordon Ngubene was extremely grateful! Herzog's face is impassive."
magistrate,Advocate Louw?
stolz,"That's right, Your Worship. LOUW You arrested Gordon Ngubene. Could you describe what happened?"
stolz,"Acting on information we had received, I went to the house of the deceased, accompanied by Lieutenant Venter, Lieutenant Botha, and three native members of the security force. This was about 10 P.M. I informed Ngubene that he was under arrest under Article 6 of the Terrorism Act. He then became violent and resisted arrest. A certain force had to be applied to restrain him."
stolz,We found several incriminating documents. These pointed to his involvement with the A.N.C. and activities endangering the security of the state.
louw,'Dear Captain. I prefer to die rather than betray any more of my friends. Amandla! Gordon Ngubene.' He hands it to the court clerk.   There's uproar at this.
louw,"Thank you, Your Worship. MAGISTRATE Advocate De Villiers?"
de villiers,"Thank you, Your Worship. Captain Stolz, you said you treated the deceased always with courtesy and correctness, then how do you account for the injuries found on the body? STOLZ Sometimes detainees deliberately injure themselves for propaganda purposes. The gallery screams its objections. Stanley leans forward and grins across the partition at Ben. The Magistrate warns the crowd. Finally the gallery quiets down. DE VILLIERS You say he tried to jump out of the open window... Are there no bars to prevent such an act? STOLZ They had been removed for repair. DE VILLIERS And why did he wish to jump out? Because you were torturing him? STOLZ He wasn't tortured."
de villiers,Perhaps it was the toothache then.
de villiers,"I put it to you, Captain -- that the only subversive activities the deceased had been involved in were his efforts to establish what happened to his son, Jonathan, allegedly shot during a riot, although several witnesses are prepared to testify that he died in detention one month later. LOUW  I protest... DE VILLIERS This would support my case that an innocent man has died in your hands under highly questionable circumstances."
louw,"If it please Your Worship... this unwarranted slur on the integrity of the special branch is unacceptable... and based, I may say, on allegations which are in any case irrelevant to the present inquest. MAGISTRATE I agree. DE VILLIERS  If the police are really interested in retaining an unsullied reputation, they should not object to the real facts being presented. Thank you, Captain. LOUW The real facts are being presented -- as the following affadivits prove. They are all by detainees -- who testify that they had all seen the deceased intermittently from the time of his detention -- to the time of his death -- and on all occasions he was in good health."
de villiers,I trust the signatories of these ... documents... are available to corroborate their evidence in person. STRAIGHT ON ARCHIBALD CHIGORIMBO
de villiers,"Mr. Archibald, when did you first meet Gordon Ngubene? ARCHIBALD  I never saw Gordon Ngubene. A sudden stillness in the court. ON Ben."
de villiers,"Thank you, Mr. Archibald."
louw," No thank you, Your Worship."
de villiers,"Your Worship, I'd like to recall Captain Stolz."
stolz,He fell down the stairs a few days ago.
stolz," I think this's a good moment to adjourn -- we'll reconvene at two thirty. EXT. COURTROOM - DAY Emily, Margaret, Stanley and a man, are sitting outside the court eating fish and chips. There are various Africans sitting around for their lunch break."
cut to:,INT. CAFE NEAR COURT - DAY Ben and Dan Lewinson having a light lunch in a nearby cafe. BEN  De Villiers is making mincemeat of them.
lewinson,He's very good. His cross- examination has got them rattled.
ben,It's obvious to anybody! The evidence is clear!  Did you see Archibal's back? He didn't have to tell the truth.
emily,"Captain Stolz lied. My husband never fight the police when he was arrested. They were rough with him, pushing him and threatening. DE VILLIERS When your husband's clothes were given to you, in what condition were they? EMILY There was blood on them and in the back pocket I found three broken teeth. DE VILLIERS Now Mrs. Ngubene, you have seen the note that's said to have been written by your husband. Do you recognize the writing?"
emily," He never wrote that letter, they lie."
de villiers,"Thank you, Mrs. Ngubene. MAGISTRATE Advocte Louw?"
magistrate, Will you take the woman out?
de villiers,I'd like to call my last witness. Grace Nkosi.
de villiers,"For how long? GRACE Six months. DE VILLIERS Can you tell us what happened to you during that time? GRACE I was interrogated by many special policemen, but mainly Captain Stolz and the one they call Venter. As they were searching somebody I know, they wanted me to tell them where that person was hidden. As I refuse to cooperate they beat me with a sjambok. After some time I fell and they kicked me in the face and stomach."
de villiers,"Thank you, Miss Grace. That's all, Your Worship. LOUW  You made that up. Say you made it up. GRACE It's the truth. I have nothing more to say. Louw sits down. MAGISTRATE We shall adjourn until tomorrow morning. I'll hear the arguments and give the verdict."
magistrate,"I have listened to all the evidence and the arguments. To begin with I have to say that there was no conclusive evidence offered to prove beyond doubt that members of the Security Police had been guilty of assault or any irregular conduct on the deceased. There were indications that Ngubene was aggressive and on more than one occasion had to be restrained with force. There was sufficient evidence to conclude that death had been caused by a trauma following pressure applied to the neck, consistent with hanging. Consequently, I find that Gordon Ngubene committed suicide by hanging himself and that on available evidence his death cannot be attributed to any act or omission or amounting to a criminal offense on the part of any person."

ben,"totally depressed, walking up to Emily."
ben,"I'm sorry, Emily."
ben,My car is over there.
melanie, Never mind your car. Let's get away from these vultures.
melanie,"By the way, I'm Melanie Bruwer."
ben,Obviously of the Rand Daily Mail. I read your article about Jonathan.
melanie,"Ten out of ten, Mr. Du Toit.      I know about you too."
ben, ... The ambiguous Stanley. MELANIE Stanley? No. Just careful. A big black rough uncut diamond. Don't be fooled by his happy-go- lucky attitude. There's much more to him.
ben,"He couldn't have given you a glowing report of me.  Mrs. Bruwer, I'm not..."
ben,"I really must go home. MELANIE Please, Mr. Du Toit, and you'll meet my darling father. She smiles again.    A disarming smile."
melanie,"Of course, Dad. I want you to meet a friend."
bruwer,Does anyone have a friend nowadays?
bruwer,"Do you like bees? BEN  Let me tell you about bees, and for that matter ants: a bee has a completely altruistic sense of purpose -- based on the common good. A course from which he cannot be deflected. Greed, ambition, they mean nothing to him. He lives solely to serve his fellow bee. MELANIE What about individuality, Dad? BRUWER There's the rub, my girl. There's the rub. One of these days I'll ask the bees. I'm sure they have the answer. Now, you two run along!"
bruwer,I've been peeing too much this morning.
ben,Please.   A...
melanie, A brandy?
ben," No thanks, a beer will be fine."
ben,"I thought they were German? Melanie sits, her legs propped up on the settee, hugging her knees."
melanie,"Mr. Du Toit, tell..."
ben," Please, call me Ben. MELANIE All right, Ben, tell me, why are you so depressed? You really expect a different verdict?"
ben, Why do you ask? Can you understand it?
melanie,Of course I understand it. What could they have. I'm not cynical. I'm only trying to be realistic.
ben,"Tell me, Miss Bruwer..."
melanie,"Ben and Melanie, that's fair. BEN Tell me, do you believe in the notion of justice? MELANIE  I'll never stop believing. But in this country I've learned it's pointless to look for it in certain situations."
ben,What use is a system if justice does not apply to all situations?
ben,That's a tall order: 'know injustice... know the enemy.' it seems I have a long haul ahead of me.
melanie,"Not at all, Ben. You have already taken the first steps.  I wanted to make you something special."
ben," Thank you, darling."
ben," I'm not so sure about that, Susan!"
susan,"I'm damned well sure! It's over, Ben! You better get that into your head. Ben just stares at her with seething anger.       She stands up and starts being hysterical. SUSAN A teacher, always a bloody teacher. You never moved yourself for us. But for the blacks, oh yes. Whose side are you on, Ben? And I'm sick and tired of those natives coming here. Why don't you bloody well go and live in Soweto?"
ben,Our boys gave the Eastern province a thrashing. PROPRIETOR Yes. Ben realizes that the man is not his usual conversational self. BEN Is anything wrong?
proprietor,No.
98.,CONTINUED: BEN See you tomorrow.
ben," How's that, Suzette?"
johan," There must be easier ways of getting your name in the paper. Before she can stop herself, Susan slaps him across the face, although not hard. Johan leaves without a word. She clutches her hand, shocked at having it against him."
ben," Who?... I don't know you and have nothing to say to you... No thank you for your advice! He puts the phone down.    The PHONE RINGS again.   Ben picks it up and waits. BEN It's you, Viviers... I appreciate it... of course... Not yet... Any thank you. Tot siens."
ben,"Morning, Mr. Cloete...   I'd like to say...  ... Mr. Cloete, may I ask what on earth has the picture to do with politics?... I'm sorry Mr. Cloete, I have to go."
bester,Everything was examined in depth in court.
ben,"Did you read the papers, Dominee? Were you happy with what came to light? And is it the Magistrate's work to pretend that the facts which came to light didn't exist? BESTER Was it really facts, Ben? Just then the African ""HERDBOY"" walks up to them taking off his lattered greasy hat. BESTER Ja?   What is it Tom? TOM  Dankie, Baas."
bester,No one but God can see what's in our hearts. 
ben,"That did not refer to our situation in this South Africa. Do you know what I believe in, Dominee, that once in one's life, just once, one should have enough faith in something to risk everything for it. BESTER One can gain the world and still lose one's soul. Tea must be ready. Bester and Ben walk towards the house still in conversation."
cloete,"I hope you don't mind us talking here. BEN I don't mind, Mr. Cloete. CLOETE I'll come to the point. You can't imagine how shocked I was by that scandalous photograph in the Ossewa."
ben,"The woman lost her husband, she was shattered with grief. CLOETE A Kaffir woman, Du Toit. BEN  I can't see that it makes any difference."
cloete,"Have you gone color blind then? And what about the apartheid laws? Our first responsibility as teachers is the reputation of the school, the pupils entrusted to us. We have to be an example to them in and out of this school yard."
viviers,"'Morning, Oom Ben."
ben, Private coffee with Cloete?
bruwer,You mean the area or the produce?
ben,Both.   What plants are these? 
ben,What about Jesus?
bruwer,Misunderstood. 
ben,What you say is very interesting and important.
bruwer,"Take for example the way the government is handling the electorate; like a bloody donkey. Carrot in front and kick at the backside. The carrot is apartheid, Dogma. The kick is quite simply, fear. Black peril, red peril, whatever name you want to give it.  We Afrikaners have to stop to turn a blind eye and look around us and at ourselves."
bruwer,You are right. We still have time. History should teach us about those who regarded themselves as the chosen people. BEN  Thank you.
ben,"There is absolutely no doubt that they were killed in custody. Those responsible must be punished, whoever they are, or whatever their rank. LEWINSON The problem is laying our hands on them. BEN Tell me, Dan, we lost at the inquest, what next? LEWINSON The family can file a civil claim."
ben,"What does that entail? LEWINSON To put it briefly, it means we have to have witnesses, affidavits and any information relating to the arrest and death of Gordon. We also need similar information on Jonathan. You see Ben, for example, Stolz figures in both cases. That's one link at least."
ben,I know what I have to do.
melanie,"I'm a journalist, perhaps tarred with the same brush."
ben,No.
melanie,"So what happened? I can imagine. The family, the dominee, colleagues, neighbors... BEN A distorted photograph and a few poisoned words and meneer Du Toit is a leper. That's why I called on you the other day, I needed to talk to somebody rational. MELANIE Thanks for the compliment. But remember, you're an Afrikaner, you're one of them. In their eyes they regard you as the worst kind of traitor."
ben,"You are an Afrikaner too, and your articles, in a liberal English paper? MELANIE My mother was a foreigner, I'm not pure, wragte Afrikaner. They don't expect the same loyalty from me that they demand from you."
ben,"What kind of loyalty? Blind loyalty. Until the deaths of Jonathan and Gordon, I gave all the loyalty I could give, laager loyalty. You know, Melanie, we Afrikaners have always lived in our laager, we have not seen what's beyond the mountains."
ben,We carry on.   There has to be justice.
melanie,"Justice. BEN We lost at the inquest, so we pursue them in a civil action.    I consulted the attorney Dan Lewinson. MELANIE We know each other well."
stolz,"Mr. Du Toit, if you knew what we're working with every day of our lives, and what we're up against, you would understand why we have to be so thorough. BEN However you go about it."
stolz,I can understand you're upset about having your house searched ... but... BEN I wasn't thinking about myself.
stolz,"What are you talking about then, Mr. Du Toit?"
ben,"My thoughts, Captain, I'm sure, are an open book to you. "
stolz,An interesting book -- Picasso -- Not one I'm familiar with.
ben,"Not on your list of banned books, Captain?"
ben, Why don't you go upstairs? STOLZ I'm afraid she has to stay where we can see her -- in case she wanted to warn someone. SUSAN My father's an M.P.!   Warn who?
susan,Where's Mama?
mother,Your father insisted that I don't disgrace you.
johan," In the study. I'll get him. FATHER-IN-LAW Have you put on weight, Susan?"
susan,"Please don't say that, Papa. Ben walks in. BEN Sorry.   Didn't hear you arrive."
ben,Fine. He goes to MOTHER-IN-LAW.        He kisses her on the cheek.
ben,"And how are you, Ma?"
ben,Why doesn't everyone sit down? SUSAN I'll prepare some tea.     I baked a cake. She goes to the kitchen.
ben,I thought you'd prefer Cape Town; the sea and Table Mountain.
ben,"We have no irrefutable evidence yet, but we have enough to indicate that something serious is being covered up. FATHER-IN-LAW You're jumping to conclusions, Ben."
ben,"I know what I'm talking about. The black waiter places the drinks on the table. FATHER-IN-LAW All right, Ben, I'm listening. Perhaps I can use my influence. But you'll have to convince me first. BEN If they have really nothing to hide, why is the special branch going out of its way to intimidate me."
ben,"They raided the house; they are tapping my phone, and I have been threatened by one of the officers. FATHER-IN-LAW I'm sorry, Ben, I'd rather not have anything to do with this sort of thing. BEN Why?"
ben,You mean you're prepared to sit back and allow an injustice to be done.
ben,I'm sorry. They drive off towards Soweto.
stanley,"Doesn't matter, Lanie -- as long we are on time for the revolution. BEN The special branch searched my house four days ago."
stanley,The S.B. searches your house?  Did they take anything?
ben,"A few journals, letters -- nothing much. Just wanted to scare me, that's all."
stanley,Don't be so sure. They may think you're onto something big.
ben,They're not that stupid. 
stanley,"'Lanie' -- don't you believe it -- nothing's as stupid as the old S.B. If they decide it's a bomb they're looking for, you can shove a turd in their face and they'll swear to God it's a bomb. He laughs... making Ben smile."
ben,"What? STANLEY Scare you? BEN No.   They tried too hard. Stanley laughs again. STANLEY Hallelujah!  Shake, man. Join the club."
stanley,"Did you hear that, Lanie?     More kids dying?"
ben,"What's happening?   What's the singing? STANLEY A wake for a child; eight months old. She was sleeping and they threw tear gas into it. They drive on. CUT TO: INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT Ben, Stanley and Emily are sitting    'round the table. Ben has pulled the lamp closer to read    one of two notes from Gordon -- one is written on ruled    paper, the other a square of toilet paper. The notes     have been smuggled out of John Vorster Square."
stanley,"Hey man, you should have been a mfundisi holiness oozer..."
julius," Okay, Stanley. It's stupid, but one is forced to do these things. He walks up to Ben and offers him his hand. JULIUS I'm Julius Nqakula... I'm banned and also under house arrest. That's why I have this ridiculous garb on. BEN I understand. STANLEY He's one of the most solid lawyers we have; they've immobilized him, that's the right word isn't it?"
julius,"May I have a glance at them? Emily produces the notes. Julius takes them. He starts reading the toilet paper, which is harder to read."
ben,"I know, with luck they may release him. JULIUS With luck. BEN But, Emily, this man is important, please try to tell him we will protect his identity. No one will know. Nothing will be done without his approval. I only want to talk to him. JULIUS Why don't you leave it to Stanley and I? What do you say, Stanley?"
stanley,Sure.
ben,"May I call you Julius, I'm not very good with some African names."
stanley," Nqakula, that's a hell of a name."
julius,"Please call me Julius. BEN This case must be reopened and we must win. We have to dig up everything. We need your cooperation, Julius. "
ben,"I wouldn't worry.    I have a secure place. STANLEY Let's hope so. EMILY I'll make some tea. STANLEY Not for me, Sis -- too strong for me. No whisky? EMILY In my house? You know better than that, Stanley."
stanley,Tea then...  ... and God forgive me --
johan," I don't care! It doesn't hurt me! Susan stares at him, at Ben, turns abruptly, walks out of the room. Johan looks at his father."
johan,"It was my friends, Dad. They're so stupid... They won't listen. They don't even want to know what you're trying to do. He's crying."
ben,Are you sure you know? 
ben,Does it worry you?
johan,"Don't stop, Dad. You mustn't give up now!"
susan, My God. They were trying to kill us. She's seated at the kitchen table. Ben has poured her a brandy which she cups in her hands.
ben,"They were trying to scare us, that's all. "
susan," Oh, is that all... What the hell more do you want to happen... we're ordinary people for God's sake -- and you've pitched us into this -- this nightmare. I can't take any more, Ben... I can't take any more!!"
ben,My house has been searched. My phone is tapped. My mail is opened. And last night three shots were fired through my window -- close to killing my wife. Viljoen reacts.
viljoen,"Mr. Du Toit, if shots were fired into your premises, we will investigate."
ben,"All I want to know, Colonel, is why don't you leave me in peace?"
ben," By the Communists, I suppose."
colored woman,"Mr. Du Toit? Ben nods, hesitatingly."
colored woman,"Please, come in. Ben walks into the living/dining room. It's a    very tidy room with a three piece sitting room suite, a   sideboard with a clock on it. At one end of the room is    the dining area. The floor is linoleum and covered with    a rug in the middle."
ben,A beer would be nice.
sadie,"You know it is. Goodbye, Mr. Du Toit, and you, be careful."
stanley,"That woman can die for you. We mustn't be long, Johnson has to be back on duty."
ben,"Alright, let's get on with it. Stanley tells me, you work at John Vorster Square."
seroke,"I had no choice, they transferred me there. BEN Yet you smuggled out letters to Emily?"
seroke," What do you do if a man asks you, and he's in trouble? STANLEY If they find out he'd be in very big trouble. BEN I know that. Tell me, what do you know about Gordon? SEROKE Very little. BEN You did talk to him from time to time?"
seroke,He gave me the letters.
ben,When was the last time you saw him? 
ben,Did you attend any of the interrogations?
seroke,"No. I'm not a member of the Special Branch. But once I had to deliver a letter to Capt. Stolz, Gordon was there. BEN  How were they interrogating him?"
ben,I see. Who were in that room? Stolz...
seroke,Lieutenant Venter and a black S.B. 
stanley,He's sure.
ben, It's very interesting. When was the last time you saw him?
seroke, I saw them take the body away to the cells. He was limp.
ben,"You did! Johnson, why do you stay with the police? You don't really belong there. SEROKE It's a job. And how can I go away? I love my family. He jumps up and faces Ben with a look of anger and panic. SEROKE They must never know I told you anything. Right? BEN I understand.    I promise."
stanley,"This is strictly between the three of us. Don't worry, man."
stanley,"Three bloody shots and you crawl on your hands and knees to people like Stolz, and say 'I give up.' What is the beginning for you is a version of what we suffer all our bloody life. Shit, I thought you had more guts than this, man! BEN I didn't say I'm giving up."
stanley,"But you thought about it. BEN Johnson has revived my determination. STANLEY It's a hell of a time, Lanie, but we'll survive. You and me. I tell you! BEN You think we may still win in the end, Stanley? STANLEY Of course not, Lanie -- but we needn't lose either -- what matters is to stick around."
stanley,"By the way, man, I'm off on a trip -- Botswana -- thought I'd tell you in case you get worried."
ben,Why are you going there?
stanley,Julius has been arrested. He broke his banning order and visited his sister. You know what that means? At least a year's imprisonment.
ben,"A year in jail just for visiting his sister? STANLEY That's the chance he took. And he'll be the last to complain. BEN Don't you think the real reason for this arrest was that they found out he was helping us? STANLEY So what? Lanie, you're not getting guilt complexes now, are you? That's a luxury only liberals can afford. Julius will be back, man. All refreshed by a spell in the deep-freeze. BEN How can we shrug off a man we've been working with? STANLEY Who said we're shrugging him off? Best way of remembering a man, Lanie, is to carry on fighting."
melanie,"What? BEN I mean not married... MELANIE And living in this chaos with my eccentric father? I love him and we get on perfectly. We have been together since I was a year old. My mother could not adapt to South Africa. She went back to London and we've never heard from her since. BEN Being a professor and bringing up a child, how did he manage that?"
melanie,"Dorothy, dear Dorothy, she was a fantastic mother. In fact she had two families, me and her three children in Alexandra township. BEN And this little girl grew up to be a tough journalist. Why a journalist? MELANIE "
melanie,"Then I married my ex-teacher. BEN Oh.   He must have been young. MELANIE Fifteen years difference. He too protected me like Dad. Then one day I visited Dorothy in Alexandra and saw her home and the appalling conditions in that township. I was shocked, Ben, and ashamed. BEN Go on. Melanie pours him another mug of coffee and starts to wipe up. MELANIE That made me think that I was a parasite, something white and maggot-like... just a thing... a sweet and ineffectual thing. I felt more and more claustrophobic. Poor Brian, who loved and pampered me. Had no idea what was happening. I left him for a whole year and we divorced."
ben,And then you became a journalist?
ben,Did it work? She returns to the kitchen with a cigarette.
melanie,I wish I could give you a straight answer. What did help me was my wanderings in Africa.
ben,"How did you manage that on a South African passport? We South Africans are white devils in Africa. MELANIE My mother was English, remember? So I get a British passport. It comes in handy even for the paper. BEN You really are your father's daughter! MELANIE I wonder what he's doing right now. Most likely standing on a rock, looking through his old binoculars at springbok or a lion or whatever. One of the two large CATS approaches them, tail in the air, and goes to Melanie, drubbing against her legs, PURRING luxuriously. She picks it up into her arms. BEN How often does he go on these trips to the veldt?"
melanie,"It depends --  -- Bonjour, Ben. I'm Porto and my friend is Bello! Ben smiles and starts to caress Porto in Melanie's arms."
emily,"Don't you touch me! Venter pulls back. The women start to ululate. Emily rises majestically, takes the youngest in her arms and walks slowly to the truck followed by her daughter. People cluster around her, singing with rage and shaking her hand. Stolz observes the scene, impassive. WOMAN  Buya!   Buya! Emily and the children are helped onto the back of the truck which drives away preceded by the police ""hippo"" and escorted from the rear by the Land Rovers. The crowd continues singing."
ben,"Couldn't you stop him?   He's a little boy, Stanley!"
other policeman,"Now, your pass, bliksem."
jaimie,You watch your bloody step!     Right?
susan, I have got to.
ben,"Without simple justice we don't deserve a future. CLOETE We're Boers, man -- Afrikaners. We are your nation. What's justice for us is justice -- period! "
cloete,"You have given me no alternative. I have to abide by the regulations of the Department of Education -- so I have made my report. And there will have to be a formal inquiry. But until such time... BEN  It won't be necessary, Mr. Cloete. I'll send you my resignation. CLOETE Thank you for making things much easier. Ben stares at him for a moment, then turns to leave.    As he reaches the door, Cloete says: CLOETE And it would be better if Johan left too. Ben turns to stare at him, amazed."
ben,"Are you serious? CLOETE He's a Kaffir-lover too, isn't he? The color drains from Ben's face. Then he steps forward, slaps Cloete thunderously across the face, hurling him back into his chair, and strides out, leaving the door ajar."
viviers," But, Oom Ben, it's about the S.B. they came to question me. Before they started questioning me I told them they were wasting their time. Ben doesn't react. VIVIERS They asked if I was cooperating with you. What I knew about the A.N.C. Can you imagine that! They then said: 'Mr. Viviers you come from a good Afrikaans family and it's important that you realize that communists are looking for people like you and before you know where you are they're using you! And, Oom Ben..."
ben, I have just resigned.
viviers, What...?
stanley,"'Lanie'... compliments of the season, old mate. BEN Stanley.   What are you doing here? Before Stanley answers, the Father-in-law gets up from his chair and goes to the kitchen. FATHER-IN-LAW Who's this Kaffir, Ben? STANLEY  That's all right. I'll..."
chris,"Let me throw him out. Ben steps between them and pushes Chris back into the dining room. STANLEY  Let him try, leave him, Lanie."
ben, Let's leave this house. I've been sworn at by a Kaffir and Ben protects him.
suzette, Chris!
ben," Come into the dining room. Stanley follows Ben slowly, swaying."
stanley," Jeez, who was that old cunt with the potbelly and black suit, looks like an undertaker? INT. DINING-ROOM - AFTERNOON"
ben,"Bloody hell! Stanley, what's wrong with you?"
ben,"God. Through the window, he sees Suzette and Chris carrying suitcases, back down the path to his in-laws' car; Father-In-Law shepherding his wife and an ashen, dazed Susan, helping them into the car."
ben,"That's the main reason for coming here tonight. Melanie, I need your help. Without Emily, we can't pursue our civil suit. The only thing left open to us is to expose them through the press, and the media here and abroad."
melanie,"And your safety also, Ben, lies in the press.  That way the world will know the brutality and power of our security services; here questions can be asked in Parliament. And the white public can appreciate the implications of the fascist laws of this country. BEN You know, Melanie, I'm discovering that the enemy is not in Soweto. The enemy is ourselves. Our bigotry, our laws, our system. We have our own fight and it's just beginning. MELANIE We better win before the blacks have won. Ben and Melanie laugh."
ben,"Now, before going to the press, I have to have all the documents. I must have two vital affidavits; Dr. Hassiem's, he's detained and Jonathan's friend, Wellington has fled to Zambia."
melanie,Zambia? I'm going to Rhodesia... I can go to Zambia. 
ben,That would be very useful.
ben,"Please. As Melanie walks away, Ben looks at her with admiration and tenderness... her dress swinging around her legs... her bare feet soundless on the floor... the quiet grace of her movement. On the way to the kitchen to get the drinks, Melanie goes to the record player. There's a record already on the turntable."
melanie," Of course, Ben. She goes into the kitchen."
melanie, Don't worry.
ben,"And hurry back. A new track starts on the RECORD. MELANIE  That's my favorite, Ben."
ben,"Listen, you... Just then a LADY and her daughter hurry to the man, push- ing a trolley. Man turns to look at Ben. WOMAN Darling, put that down, it's not good for your cholesterol. BEN  I'm sorry, my mistake."
ben,-- How's she doing? SUZETTE Better... She's waiting for you to ask her to come home.
ben,I doubt it.
suzette,"Papa, I don't want to interfere... BEN Then don't."
ben,"Suzette... SUZETTE  Please, Papa, for Mom's sake... For all of our sakes... Let's try and patch it up."

ben,"Just one thing, Doctor. Why did you sign the State Pathologist's report on the autopsy if you drew up your own report as well? DR. HASSIEM "

ben, I think so.
ben, God!   It's Johnson Seroke.
ben," Bloody bastards! They killed him. Stolz must have thought he knew too much. STANLEY What's the score? The nurse is detained; the mortuary attendant has disappeared; the police van driver who brought Jonathan to hospital is detained. Julius is in jail, and now Johnson dead. BEN Who's next on their secret list, I wonder? How much longer must the list grow of those who pay the price of our efforts to clear Gordon's name."
stanley,"Hey! Are you going soft, Lanie? We must keep going even more so now. And for every bloke who's going to die of bloody natural causes in their hands. And for our children's future."
ben,"I know. If I can no longer believe that right is on my side, if I can no longer believe in imperative to go on, what will become of me, Stanley? Ben looks at Johnson's picture again and shakes his head."
stolz,"We're all made of flesh and blood, Mr. Du Toit -- we've all got our flaws. And if a man likes to sample the grass on the other side of the fence, well, that's his own business. But it would be unpleasant if people found out about it, especially if he's a teacher. BEN You mean, if I cooperate, if I stop digging, embarrassing you, threatening you... these photographs will disappear."
stolz,Let's just say I may be able to use my influence to make sure that a private indiscretion isn't used against you. BEN Suppose I refuse? Stolz looks past Ben. STOLZ Is this your son?
ben,"Johan, leave us alone, please."
stolz,Don't you think this business has gone long enough?
ben,"It's not possible, Captain.    Not between you and me. STOLZ It's high time, Mr. Du Toit, we allowed the dead to rest in peace. I'm offering you a chance."
ben,You mean my very last chance?
stolz,"One never knows. It may not be important to you, but we have to survive."
ben,"If we can only survive through murder and torture, then we have forfeited our right to exist."
ben,"Before you go. I'll tell this, Captain. I have a pretty good idea of what I will eventually uncover. I mean the truth. And I won't allow anyone or anything to come between me and that truth."
stolz,"Here's my card -- my private line. If you should change your mind... Let's say before the end of the week? BEN Goodbye, Captain, and don't forgt the photograph. Stolz picks up the photograph and puts it into his briefcase."
stolz," Be careful, Mr. Du Toit. There are people who can make things very difficult for you. BEN They are wasting their time. They just can't hurt me anymore. I trust you'll give them the message, Captain."
johan," A brandy, Papa?"
ben, A gin and tonic would be fine.
ben,"I'm waiting for a passenger, Miss Bruwer. She's taking a rather long time to be cleared."
official,What did you say her name was?
ben,Melanie Bruwer. OFFICIAL I'll go and check. 
johan,"Is there any other exit, Papa? BEN No. They have to collect their luggage and pass through customs. JOHAN  That's possble."
stolz,"Word came to me that you were asking after your very good friend, Miss Bruwer. You know, subersives come in all guises and can be very resourceful. Now let's take your friend, she has been using her privilege as a journalist to endanger the security of this country. But you know something else? She has been secretly holding a British passport. A South African passport and a British pasport. Now you tell me, where is her patriotism? Her allegiance? The minister telexed to the immigration officers here declaring her an undesirable immigrant. So she is being put on the first available plane to London. This must be heart- breaking for you. Good afternoon, Meneer Du Toit, Johan. Stolz walks back."
