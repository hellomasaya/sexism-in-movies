dorothy baker,"There, there, Miss Daisy... you'll scratch yourself to ribbons...  ...prob'ly today."
caroline,"Do you want more medication, Mother? The doctor said you can have all you want."
daisy,Curious.   What comes next...
dorothy baker,The pain's coming more steadily... Her breathing will falter soon... No need for her to suffer..
daisy,They built that train station in 1918. Your father was there the day it opened... He said a tuba band was playing...Oom-pah-pah...
daisy,"Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah...The finest clockmaker in all of the South built that clock..."
blanche devereux,"""I am sorry to inform you that your son was killed fighting for his country, at the battle of the Marne. In the death of Sgt. Martin Gateau I lose one of my most trusted men. "
monsieur gateau,"I made it this way... so that perhaps, the boys who were lost in the war might stand and go home again..."
monsieur gateau,"Perhaps, my own son might come home again..."
monsieur gateau,I'm sorry if I offended anybody. I hope you enjoy my clock.
daisy,He just rowed...rowed...away...
dorothy baker,Do you mind if I make myself a call? I've got somebody watching my little boy.
caroline,"No, please go call..."
daisy,"Oh honey, you could never disappoint me."
caroline,I wished I had more to show for myself. I know you would have liked to have had grandchildren. 
daisy,What's normal?     A hat full of sand.
caroline,What?
daisy, I need my brown suitcase... The envelope...
caroline,An envelope?
daisy,I tried to read it a hundred different times... but I couldn't bring myself...
caroline,What do you mean?
daisy,Read it to me.
caroline,"It's dated ""April 4, 1985."" It says, ""New Orleans.""  All I have is my story... I'm writing it now while I still remember it..."""

queenie, The poor child got the worse of it... came out white...
doctor rose,"There are places for 'unwanted' babies like these, Queenie... There's no room for another mouth to feed here... The Nolan Foundation, despite their good intentions, thinks this place is a large nuisance as it is... A baby here --"

queenie, I have something to tell you all...
benjamin,"What does she mean ""answered her prayers?"""
daisy,"She's going to have a baby, silly. That's what my mother said when I was going to have a little brother. He didn't live long though. He didn't breathe right..."
daisy, Are you sleeping?
benjamin, Where are we going?
daisy,Under here...
benjamin,I'm not supposed to use matches...
daisy,Don't be chicken...
benjamin,I'm younger than I look.
daisy, You don't seem like an old person... like my grandma... Are you sick?
benjamin, But I fooled them so far.
daisy,You are different than anybody I have ever met. Can I?
grandma fuller,What are you doing under there? Who's idea was this candle?
queenie,You are a different child... a man child. People aren't going to understand how different you are.
benjamin," What's wrong with me, Mother?"
queenie,"God hasn't said yet. Now, back to bed and behave yourself."
ngunda oti, You get used to it...
caroline,"Are you alright, Mother?"
daisy, Go on.
caroline,"He crossed out something... and then he's written... ""When..."""
ngunda oti,I come to say goodbye. I'm going away.
benjamin,Going away?   Where?
ngunda oti,I don't figure that out yet. I will send you a postcard when I get to there.
benjamin,What about your friend?   The tall lady?
ngunda oti,We're not friends anymore. That's what happens with tall people.
benjamin,Goodbye...
the woman,I'm moving in today.
queenie,Welcome... we was expecting you... 
the woman,"He's as old as the hills. Blind too. Can hardly get around, he won't be a bother much longer."
queenie,I guess as long as he stays out from underfoot.
benjamin,I'm Benjamin...
the woman,"It isn't how well you play, it's how you feel about what you're playing.  Try this."
daisy,"Oh, darlin', the pain..."
caroline,I'll get the nurse...
the nurse,You're not feeling too good?
caroline,I haven't spent as much time as I would have like with her the last few years.
the woman,You busy?
caroline, The next page says...
a man, He never pays... He always says he'll have to owe it to you...
benjamin,I do...!
benjamin, I do. I think.
benjamin,"Yes, Captain!"
benjamin,"Right away, sir...!"
benjamin,I haven't found out yet.
benjamin,Not as old as I look.
benjamin,It's a short story...
benjamin, I do every morning.
benjamin, I guess.
benjamin,Never.
benjamin,Not that I know of.
benjamin,Never.
benjamin,I never met my father.
benjamin,You didn't want to spend the rest of your life on a tugboat.
benjamin, But you're a tugboat captain.
the woman,"Captain Mike, we're ready for you and your friend..."
benjamin, I thought it was $2 for a day's work...
the girl,"How are you tonight, Grandpa?"
the girl,Clean yourself up...
benjamin,Is that any better?
the girl,Let's go... Time's a wastin'...
benjamin,Ohhh...!
the girl, Come by anytime...
benjamin,Again?
the girl,Again?
benjamin,Again?
the girl,Again?

benjamin,Thank you...
the girl," No, thank you..."
benjamin,You'll be here tomorrow?
the girl,"Every night, but Sunday..."

benjamin,"That's very kind of you, Sir."
thomas button,"My name is Thomas, Thomas Button."
benjamin,I'm Benjamin.
thomas button," Benjamin... Yes, Benjamin... It's a pleasure to know you."
the waiter,What will it be sir?
benjamin,I'll have whatever he's having.
thomas button,A Sazerac for both of us...with whiskey instead of brandy...
benjamin,It's a night for firsts...
thomas button,How is that?
benjamin,I've never been to a whore house either.
thomas button,It's an... experience...
benjamin,It certainly is.  I'm not very experienced about a lot of things.
thomas button,That isn't a bad thing.
benjamin,There's a first time for everything.
thomas button,True enough. I don't mean to be rude... but your hands seem awful bent... It must be quite painful?
benjamin,I don't really know what I have. I have some form of a disease. I have a lot of catching up to do.
thomas button,What kind of a disease?
benjamin,I was born old.
thomas button,I'm sorry.
benjamin, No need to be. Nothing wrong with old age.
thomas button,I'm sorry about your disease.
benjamin,My mother says we're all born with something...
thomas button,Your mother?
benjamin,I'm adopted.
thomas button,... My wife passed away many years ago...
benjamin, I'm very sorry.
thomas button,She died in childbirth.
benjamin, To mothers and fathers...
thomas button,"Buttons. ""Button's Buttons."" There isn't a button we don't make. Our biggest competition is B.F. Goodrich and his infernal zippers..."
the waiter,Would you gentlemen like another?
thomas button,One more Benjamin?
benjamin,"If you'll let me pay for it, Mr. Button..."
thomas button,What kind of work do you do?
benjamin, I'm a tugboat man.
thomas button,I enjoyed talking to you...
benjamin,I enjoyed drinking with you...
thomas button, Benjamin...
benjamin, Anytime.
thomas button," Goodnight, Benjamin."
benjamin, Absolutely... Mr. Button...
benjamin,I listened to some music.... I --
benjamin, Do you want to see something?   We have to keep it secret.
benjamin,Ssssh...  Can you swim?
daisy,I can do anything you can do...
benjamin,Put this on...
daisy,What's wrong with him?
benjamin,I think he has mejembe.  Captain Mike... could you take us out?
benjamin,Sunday.
benjamin,You're drunk every night.
benjamin,A close friend... I wanted to show her the River.
benjamin,What does it take to build something like that?
daisy,Imagine all the places they're going to see...
caroline,"Did you say something, Mother?"
daisy,Look at that... time just seeped out of me...
caroline,What?
daisy,Somebody will come and mop it up and that will be the end...
caroline,Do you want me to go on reading?
the woman,"I don't know how it's possible, you seem to have more hair..."
benjamin, What if   I was to tell you I wasn't getting   older -- I was getting younger   than everybody else...
the woman,"Well, I'd feel very sorry for you... to have to see everybody you love, die before you."
the woman,Benjamin... We're meant to lose the people we love. How else would we know how important they are to us.
benjamin,Would you like to go for a walk?
tizzy," Good luck, son."
benjamin,"Goodbye, Mother..."
daisy,Benjamin... Benjamin...
benjamin,To sea.    I'll send you a postcard.
daisy,From everywhere. Write me a postcard from everywhere...
caroline, I think I should find out what's going on...
daisy, There's a box of them... in a velvet bag...
caroline,Is this what you're looking for?
daisy,Looking for?
caroline,You said you wanted this?
daisy,Of course.
caroline," ""I had gone.."""
john grimm,"You know one in every eight boats never returns, all hands lost at sea."
daisy,I wrote him constantly... told him everything I was doing...
daisy,"Oh. Then he wrote me... ""I've met somebody... and I've fallen in love..."""
a man,Places everybody... Once again...
daisy,"""...I've met somebody...and I've fallen in love..."" My, that was over...  ...sixty years ago."
caroline,"Did you love him, mother?"
daisy,What can a girl know about love?
caroline," ""...We were working in Murmansk, Russia..."""
benjamin,"Well Captain, you do drink a lot..."
elizabeth abbott,What are you looking at?
elizabeth abbott,I broke the heel off of one of my shoes...I don't usually walk around in my bare feet...
benjamin,I'm sorry... I can't sleep...
elizabeth abbott,"Some honey, thank you."
benjamin,Do you like flies with your tea?
elizabeth abbott,You must let it steep for a minute...
benjamin,Steep?
elizabeth abbott,Sit. There's a proper way to make tea.
benjamin,"Where I'm from, they just want it to be hot."
elizabeth abbott,You're a seaman? I don't mean to be rude...but aren't you rather old to be working on a boat?
benjamin,There's no age limit... as long as you can do the work...
elizabeth abbott,You have trouble sleeping?
benjamin,I didn't know I did... I usually sleep like a baby. Something kept me up.
elizabeth abbott,"I never sleep... Well, rarely anyway..."
benjamin,Did he?
elizabeth abbott,Did he what?
benjamin,Die in his sleep?
elizabeth abbott,He died sitting in his favorite chair listening to his favorite program on the radio.
benjamin, He must have known something.
elizabeth abbott,My husband's the British Trade Minister. We've been here fourteen months... We were supposed to be going to Peking... but it just never did work out. It never does seem to work out. Have you been to the Far East?
benjamin,I haven't really been anywhere. I mean outside different harbors.
elizabeth abbott,Where are you from?
benjamin,"New Orleans, Louisiana."
elizabeth abbott, I didn't know there was another one.
benjamin, The Mississippi River.
elizabeth abbott,I can tell you what bars look like in places all over the world...
elizabeth abbott,Thank you for the tea...
elizabeth abbott,I may have given you the wrong impression.
benjamin,The wrong impression?
elizabeth abbott,You must think I don't love my husband.
benjamin,Why do you say that?
elizabeth abbott,Married women don't usually sit with strange men in a hotel in the middle of the night. I certainly don't.
benjamin, I don't know what married women do or don't do.
elizabeth abbott,Let's get one thing straight. I love him very much. I happen to think he is one of the smartest and most considerate men I ever met. It is not his fault I decided to spend my life in his shadow.
elizabeth abbott,He started to take his pants off... I'm afraid he misread me completely...
caroline,"Are you upset, Mother?"
daisy,It must have been very cold. I'm glad he had somebody to keep him warm.
caroline," ""I couldn't wait to see her again."""
benjamin, I'm not dressed --
elizabeth abbott,You're delicious just as you are...
benjamin,No. Not many. At least none on a Sunday.
elizabeth abbott, I feel like I'm with a virgin.
elizabeth abbott,Why wouldn't I?
elizabeth abbott,"I never did. As a matter of fact, I have never done much of anything with my life after that..."
benjamin,Do I look okay? I borrowed it from one of the men. It's his church suit.
elizabeth abbott,You take my breath away.
benjamin,I feel so much younger when I'm with you...
elizabeth abbott,"That's such a nice thing to say. You make me feel years younger, too. I wish I was. I would change so many things. I would undo all of my mistakes."
benjamin,What mistakes?
elizabeth abbott,"I kept waiting, thinking I would do something to change my circumstance... Do something... But I never did... It's an awful waste, you can never get it back... wasted time..."
benjamin,Are you as cold as I am?
elizabeth abbott," My god, colder."
elizabeth abbott,Get a key.
benjamin,Hold it...
benjamin, Elizabeth...
benjamin, I'll go captain!
the cook,I was planning on talking to you Cap'n Mike... My wife's doing poorly. I'd like to see her one more time...
john grimm," Who do you intend to have cook then? One of the leading causes of death at sea is food poisoning, right after inadequate safety equipment."
benjamin,"I grew up cooking, sir. I'll take the job, if I'm not too old to serve."
dennis smith,You have these pacifists. They say they won't fight on conscience. Where would we be if everybody decided to act according to their conscience?
dennis smith, Where else can you shoot white people and get away with it...
benjamin, You're from the Kentucky mountains aren't you? It must be pretty there..
john grimm,There's something not normal about him.
dennis smith," Whoever said ""War is hell,"" doesn't know shit from shinola."
pleasant curtis,I've been watching you. You seem trustworthy. If something happens to me... could you see this gets to my wife...?
pleasant curtis,"If anything happens I want my family to know I was thinking about them, and if I could have, I'd have come back home."
benjamin,You're going to heaven Captain Mike. You're going to heaven.
benjamin,You mind...
the sailor,This don't get fixed...
benjamin,Is your mother home?
the girl,She's gettin' supper ready....
benjamin, Queenie...
queenie,Lord have mercy....you're home...
queenie,"Your brother, Benjamin..."
the girl,I didn't know he was my brother.
queenie, There's a shit load of things you don't know...
benjamin,You never know what's comin' for you.
queenie,Did you learn anything worth repeating?
benjamin,I saw a lot of things.
queenie,You seen some pain.
benjamin,Where's Tizzy?
queenie,"Mr. Weathers died in his sleep one night last April. He's sleeping comfortably now in the cemetery on St. James street, God rest his soul..."
benjamin,I'm so sorry...
queenie,There's only one or two of them left now... They all just about new... waitin' their turn like everybody else... I am so glad to have I you back. Now we got to find you some proper work and get you married right...
queenie,"You're wasting your time... he's stone deaf... You'll be staying in what was Mrs. DeSeroux's room now, you're too much of a man to stay in the attic anymore."
daisy,"Oh, excuse me... is Queenie here...?"
benjamin,"Daisy... it's me, Benjamin."
daisy,Benjamin...Oh my God it's you... Of course it's you...
benjamin,Just a few weeks ago...
daisy,I spoke to Queenie...she told me you were in the war...somewhere at sea... I was so worried about you...
benjamin, I'm okay.
benjamin,I can't get over you -- You are so lovely...
daisy,You stopped writing.
benjamin,I feel terrible about it... 
daisy,...Beautiful.
caroline,"He said, ""The most beautiful,"" Mother."
daisy,What else did he say about...
caroline,He said...
daisy,"I can't get over you're home... I've been planning to come by for awhile... my grandmother, you remember Grandma Fuller... of course you remember her... she passed away..."
benjamin,I heard that... I'm sorry...
daisy,I've been wanting to get some of her things...
daisy,"I can't believe I open the door, and you're actually standing there...It must be fate... What do they call it, ""Kismet""? I read a book about a man named Edgar Cayce, a psychic, everything is predetermined...I like to think it's fate. What do you think, Benjamin?"
benjamin,"I don't know how it works, but I'm sure glad it happened..."
daisy, Have you been to New York...? It's just across the bridge from me... I can actually see the Empire State Building if I stand on my bed... Where have you been? Tell me everything. The last time you wrote you said you were in Russia? I always wanted to go to Russia... Is it as cold as they say...? You wrote you met somebody... did it work out...?
benjamin, Remember this?
daisy,"...This is the picture of Old Man Kangaroo at five in the afternoon..."""
benjamin,Are you hungry? Would you like to get something to eat?
daisy,I would love that...
daisy," Oh my god, I've been just talking about myself..."
benjamin,I'm enjoying listening...
daisy,I'm old enough. I`m old enough for a lot of things....
benjamin,Yes you are...
daisy,I have to go back tomorrow... I wish I could stay...
benjamin,Which part?
daisy,That someone wanted to sleep with me.
benjamin,People should want to sleep with you... You're very desirable...
daisy,Let's go back to the house... or get a room somewhere... we can put down your coat...
benjamin,It's not that I don't want to... I just can't... not tonight....Its just not...
daisy,I'm old enough.
benjamin,"Go back to New York, Daisy... Be with the people you are so fond of... You can only be young once..."
daisy,Do you think you are too old for me... I've been with older men...
daisy,You look so handsome in that suit... your hair...
the nurse,They're sayin' the hurricane's going to miss us... blow right on by...
caroline,"Oh, that's great."
daisy,Good news?
caroline,The hurricane.     It is going to miss us.
daisy,I'll just stay under the blankets with my mother. She said nothing would happen to me.
caroline,Would you like me to keep reading?
thomas button,"Hello, Benjamin... Do you remember me?"
benjamin,"Of course, Mr. Button... What happened to you?"
thomas button,"My foot was infected... I'm afraid they had to remove it...  Welcome home, my friend."
benjamin,You're still drinking Sazerac with whiskey instead of brandy.
thomas button,I'm a man of habit.
benjamin, Are you still visiting the house on Bourbon street?
thomas button, Not for a long time.
thomas button,The war has been kind to the button industry... we had gone from making forty thousand buttons a day to making two hundred and fifty thousand... We employed ten times the number of workers... We were operating around the clock...
benjamin,"I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Button."
thomas button,I don't have any people. I keep to myself. I -- I'm frightened. I hope you won't mind... but whenever it's possible... I would enjoy your company...
benjamin,"I'll do what I can, Mr. Button."
thomas button," Tell me Benjamin, do you know anything about buttons?"
benjamin,Just what holds my shirt on.
thomas button," ... comes from the French, ""bouton,"" meaning a bud, or any round object..."
thomas button,The practice of buttoning originated in the 13th century... when baggy clothing was replaced with more form-fitting clothes...
benjamin,It's all very interesting.   But what do you want from me?
thomas button,"I said, our family has been in the business for a hundred and twenty- four years."
benjamin,Our family?
thomas button,"You are my family. Benjamin, you are my son."
benjamin,My mother?
thomas button,"...A great uncle, from Germany.  1915, three years before you were born."
benjamin,Why didn't you tell me?
thomas button,I made a mistake.
benjamin,I better go.
thomas button,Where are you going?
benjamin,Home.
queenie," ...He thinks he can just show up, and everything gonna be fine and dandy, everybody gonna be friends... He got another thing coming..."
benjamin, Thomas...
thomas button,"Thank you, Benjamin."
queenie, Don't you suffer alone for it.
benjamin, His wife.
benjamin,"My name is Benjamin, Benjamin...  Button..."
benjamin,That's about it.
benjamin,I'm a friend of Daisy's...
the man,Daisy has company...
daisy,Somebody's looking for me?...
benjamin,I thought I'd come visit... spend some time with you if I could...
daisy,I wish you would have called... You caught me by surprise.
benjamin,I couldn't take my eyes off of you... you were mesmerizing...
daisy,That's so nice of you to say... These are lovely... Thank you...
benjamin,Somebody told me about a restaurant I thought you might enjoy... I made a reservation... Just in case --
daisy, ...all the dancers go out together after the show... You're welcome to come with us... There'll be all sorts of interesting people... Let me get changed.
daisy,I'll get you a drink...
david,You were her grandmother's friend or something like that...?
benjamin,Something like that.
daisy, I knew I'd hurt you... Maybe I intended to...
daisy,"I did what you told me to... enjoy my life... I'm only going to be young once... I had no idea you were coming. What did you think I was going to do...? You can't expect me to just drop everything, Benjamin... this is my life..."
david, There's a party downtown we're going to...
daisy," Why don't you come with us, Benjamin... There'll be a lot of musicians, interesting people there.... You'll have a good time..."
benjamin,I came here to tell you I made a mistake before...A day doesn't go by that I don't regret it...It's not the way I felt...I should have never let you go...I came because I hoped I could be with you...
david,"Daisy, you going to come...?"
benjamin,Do you love him?
caroline,Did you Mother?
daisy,I think so. I think I do.
benjamin, Okay. Okay... I'll see you in New Orleans...
daisy, He came to tell me his father had died.
caroline,You couldn't have known.
caroline,I've never seen these... You never talked about your dancing very much...
daisy,"I was as good as I was ever going to be. For five years... I danced everywhere... London, Prague, Vienna, and I was the only American invited to dance with the Bolshoi... It was glorious..."
daisy,"Goodnight, Benjamin..."
daisy,What did he say?
carol,"""Life wasn't very complicated..."""
queenie,Mrs. La Tourneau just passed away.
benjamin,That would be me....
the woman,It will just be a minute... please have a seat...
benjamin,"Hello, Daisy..."
daisy,Who told you?
benjamin,Your friend wired me.
daisy,"That was very kind of you... to come all the way here, to see that I was alright."
benjamin,You would have done the same for me...
daisy,"My God, look at you. You're perfect...."
benjamin,I'll get a room... and once you can leave you'll come home with me to New Orleans. Where you can be with people who love you.
daisy,What home? Who's we? I'm not going back to New Orleans. New Orleans is your home... I don't have a home... I haven't been home for five years... I'm not going anywhere with you...
benjamin,"Alright, I'll stay here in Paris... I'll help you with anything you need..."
daisy,Benjamin...! I know I'm feeling sorry for myself... But it wasn't supposed to be like this... 
benjamin,You'll change your mind.
daisy,"We're not little children playing under the table... Remember, when you came to New York. You didn't belong there. I didn't want to be with you then, I don't want to be with you now! I want you to leave! I'm not going anywhere with you! I want you to stay out of my life!"
daisy,I was awfully cruel. He didn't understand. I couldn't have him see me that way...
caroline," ""I didn't leave right away..."""
daisy, No?
daisy,I never knew that.
caroline,I'll get the nurse...
the nurse,Let's get you comfortable.
daisy,"Every morning Monsieur Foley leaves eggs and bread and mil,. There's a cafe across the street. People sitting and drinking and talking... I lay on my bed thinking about the rest of my life... about people... about home... until I fall asleep."
caroline," He said, ""I went back..."" But then there are a whole lot of pages torn out..."
daisy, A man would go up and clean it. Try and fix what was broken.
daisy,Don't you want to know where I've been?
benjamin,No. I don't care where you've been -- I'm just happy you're back.
queenie, How come you didn't write or nothin'? Just disappearing like that?
daisy,It was what I needed to do for myself.
queenie,I never took you to be selfish. I hope I'm not wrong. I'm not usually wrong about people.
daisy,She's still taking care of you. 
benjamin,I don't want to ruin it...
benjamin,Goodnight.
daisy,Sleep with me.
benjamin,Are you sure?
daisy,Yes.
daisy,We wouldn't have this... We wouldn't be here... It happened when it was supposed to happen...
benjamin,Relationships have a time and a place.
daisy,Don't say that.
benjamin,"What I mean is... You don't usually get more than one chance. If you miss it, it's too late... and it's gone... We're lucky... we had more than one chance."
daisy, That's easy for you to say... You'll have plenty of chances.
benjamin,Have you ever had a Sazerac with whiskey not brandy?
daisy,Bet I can stay out here longer than you can.
benjamin,Bet you can't.
daisy,"You barely have a line, a crease, or a wrinkle... Everyday I have more wrinkles you have less..."
benjamin,I love your wrinkles.
daisy,What does it feel like growing younger?
benjamin,I don't know... I'm always looking out of my own eyes...
daisy,Will you still love me when I can't stand straight... when my skin grows old and spotted...
benjamin,Will you still love me when I have pimples. When I think it's funny to make fart noises...
daisy,Maybe some things last...
benjamin,I've never seen anything not come to an end...
daisy,Maybe it's something you can't see...
daisy,"Goodnight, Benjamin."
benjamin,"Goodnight, Daisy..."
daisy, Caroline?
caroline, I don't understand. When did you meet Dad?
daisy,Dear Robert... some time after that...
caroline,Did you ever tell him about this Benjamin?
daisy,He knew enough. He loved me as I was. I loved him for who he was. What more was needed?
caroline,"""That night, in the Caribbean I had a visitor..."""
queenie,I wanted to tell you I love you and your mama's gone...
daisy,Is anything wrong?
benjamin,Queenie came to tell me she loved me... and that my mother was gone.
daisy,...go back to sleep...
benjamin, Hello... Queenie... we're back...
benjamin,We are meant to lose the people we love. It's how we know how important they are to us.
the woman,...It's such a lovely place... You must have a lot of fond memories. It must be hard for you to give it up.
the man,Is Mrs. Williamson here yet... I'm sorry to be late...
the woman,"It's a wonderful old place, darling... I think we will be so happy here..."
benjamin,They come with the house...
daisy, I loved that house... it smelled like firewood... The chimney leaked smoke... We didn't care... Oh don't stop dear... don't stop...
benjamin,You're crying...
daisy,It's just the chlorine...
benjamin,You chose something to do... something so special... so unique... there was such a short period of time that you could do it... Even if nothing had happened ... Sooner or later you would be in the same place you are now...
daisy,I don't like getting old.
daisy,"I promise you, I'll never lose myself to self-pity again..."
caroline,I thought the wind had shifted away...
daisy, I don't remember if I turned the lights off. Did I leave the heater on?
the nurse,Let's get you comfortable...
daisy,You have the most beautiful eyes.
caroline,"He said, ""She found peace."""
daisy, Peace.
benjamin,You're still beautiful to watch...
daisy,Dancing is all about the line... the line of your body...after awhile... you lose the line... and you can never get it back...
benjamin, We finally caught up to each other...
daisy,I thought I was far too old... I'm pregnant...
caroline," You were pregnant? You never said anything, did you? I mean, what happened to the child?"
daisy, The child...
caroline, They said if you needed oxygen...
daisy,"I want to breathe on my own... Please... sit down, my darling..."
caroline,"""She flourished..."""
daisy, Hmmm...
daisy,"I thought I heard the nurse slip, and say ""he..."""
daisy,I know you're afraid.
benjamin,I'm not hiding it.
daisy,Okay.   What's your worst fear?
benjamin,What if it has...what if its like me?...
daisy,Then we'll love it all the more...
benjamin,I want to be father... not a little brother... I don't want to be picked up from elementary school by my kid... I don't want anyone babysitting me...
daisy,"I'm going to make this work... This is what I want, and I want it with you..."
benjamin,"You know, there's nothing I wouldn't do for you..."
daisy,"Would you tell a blind man he can't have children? You will be a father for as long as you can. I know the consequences. I accepted that. Your love, loving you, is worth everything to me.  For the fiftieth time today I've got to go pee..."
elizabeth abbott, Anything's possible.
daisy,Ready?
benjamin,Yes.
benjamin,Get me an ambulance... My wife is seven months pregnant and fell on the stairs...
daisy,Benjamin... the baby's coming...
benjamin,You're sure there's nothing wrong with her?
caroline,He was my father...? This Benjamin was my father? 
daisy,It doesn't change for a moment who you are. You were a gift. Sometimes the gifts we are given are not free.
caroline,You never said a word to me...
daisy," My dearest darling, we were both deprived of him..."
the nurse,It can get to you...
daisy,I was worried you weren't coming back...
caroline, You're all I have.
daisy,"Read the rest of it, darling. "
caroline,"""You grew, like the doctor had said, normal and healthy..."""
benjamin,Don't eat sand...
daisy,What are you talking about?
benjamin,She needs someone to grow old with...
daisy,She'll learn to accept whatever happens... She loves you...
benjamin,She needs a father not a playmate.
daisy,Is it that my age is starting to show...? Is that what you are telling me? Have you lost your desire for me...?
benjamin,You don't need another child to raise...
daisy,"You're going to leave me, aren't you?"
a man,Before you look around they'll be in High School dating.
daisy,I remember your first birthday like it was yesterday.
benjamin,I want you to know I love you...
caroline,"I almost wish I didn't know any of this.  I feel odd, reading...it..."
daisy,I don't know.    I never heard from him.
caroline,There are postcards...
caroline,"""... I hope you start all over again..."""
daisy, He'd been gone for a long time...
daisy,Somebody left their slipper...
benjamin,I wanted to see you both.
caroline,"You ready, Mom?"
daisy,"No... He was telling me a very sad story about a mutual friend we hadn't seen in a long time... This is my friend, Benjamin... you knew him when you were... just a baby..."
caroline,Hi...
benjamin,Hello...
the man,I'm sorry... I thought you were done...
daisy,This is a friend of my family's... Benjamin Button... this is my husband... Robert...
robert,"It was nice to have met you... We'll be in the car, darling..."
daisy,I'm just closing up...
benjamin,She's so lovely... she looks like you... Does she dance?
daisy,Not very well.
benjamin,I suppose that would be from my side of things.
benjamin,Just what you can see.
daisy,You ware right. She needed a father. I couldn't have raised both of you. I'm not that strong.
benjamin,I'm at the Pontchartrain Hotel on the avenue. I have no idea what I'm going to do.
daisy,I have to go.
caroline,That young man was my father?
the nurse,The hurricane changed directions again. They are predicting it will make landfall sometime soon.
caroline,Is there anything we need to do?
the nurse,Arrangements are being made to move people if we have to. I'll let you know as soon as we know anything.
daisy,Please tell me what he says?
benjamin,Hello?
daisy,May I come in?
benjamin,Please...
daisy,Nothing lasts.
benjamin,I never once stopped loving you...
daisy,"I'm an old woman now, Benjamin."
benjamin,Some things you don't ever forget... the feel... the taste...
daisy,Please read...
caroline,That's the last thing he wrote...
daisy,A year or so after your father passed... There was a call...
daisy,Hello?... Yes?... Speaking -- I don't understand? Where was that?
daisy,It's the last house...
daisy,I'm Daisy...
the man,Thank you for coming... I'm David Hernandez with the Orleans Parish department of Child Welfare Services.
queenie's daughter,I told Mr. Hernandez about Benjamin bein' one of us. I told him if he needs a place to stay... it's alright... he can stay here... he is blood after all...
daisy,Benjamin.
daisy,You play really beautifully.
the man,He doesn't seem to like to be touched.
daisy,Do you remember me?   I'm Daisy.
daisy,It's good to meet you Benjamin. Do you mind if I sit with you? I would love to hear you play.
daisy,Queenie's daughter saw to it that he was taken care of...
queenie's daughter,You just ate breakfast.
queenie's daughter,He doesn't believe he's already had his breakfast.
daisy,Let's see if we can find something else for you to do.
daisy,I know you can't.
daisy,What do you mean?
daisy,It's alright... It's alright to forget things...
daisy, I wish you'd come down...
daisy,"You're right, you can see everything sweetheart..."
daisy, I knew a man who could fly. Come down and I'll tell you all about him.
daisy,And I went to take care of him...
daisy,How would you like to help me unpack?
daisy,"This is the picture of old Man Kangaroo at five in the afternoon, when he got his beautiful hind legs just as Big God Ngong had promised."
daisy,That's right... Benjamin and Daisy...
caroline,I'm going to see what they want us to do...
caroline,"He started to write something else... ""I'm going..."" But he stopped..."
daisy,Now you do.
caroline,I'd better go and see what they're planning to do...
daisy,"Goodnight, Benjamin..."
