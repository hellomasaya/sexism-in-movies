sophina,They told you today?
oscar,"Keep it real, they fired me two weeks ago."
sophina,Don't fucking my bad me Osc! What was you doin when you was pretending to go to work? You know what? I don't even want to know.
oscar,I thought I was gonna be able to get my shit back.
sophina, You think life a fucking joke... You think you're gonna get fired and then somebody is gona give you thier job back? What world do you live in?
oscar,"Phina,"
sophina,"You aint shit, you know that? You lie to me, you lie to your fucking daughter. You don't give a fuck about us."
oscar,I didn't have to tell you shit.
sophina,"So you would have just kept faking like you were going to work? And would have just been out bustin nocks? And doing whatever else, or WHOEVER else you do while I'm at work?"
oscar,I thought you wanted the truth... But you ain't trying to hear that.
sophina,"I want you to be honest with me. But off top. From the fucking jump. Not after you lie for two weeks get cornered, and don't have a choice.  What did you today. Hmm. I bet you sold that fucking zip."
oscar,I dumped it. I'm done with that shit. I'm tired. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Thought I could start fresh today. But that shit aint working out.
sophina,You threw it away?
oscar,"I don't know? Something legal. Gonna see if my sister can hire me again, while I look. Maybe if I can just not fuck up, for 30 days.. Oprah said that's all it takes to form a habit, right?"
sophina,Look at me.
oscar,Happy Birthday!
wanda,Hey baby. You guys are just in time.
oscar,"Don't trip, it wasn't that much."
oscar,Who you goin for in the Super Bowl Unc?
ceephus,Steelers.
daryl,"A Raiders fan, cheering for the Steelers."
ceephus,"Black uniforms, black players, black coach. Coach even has a black wife. I'm going with the Steelers."
daryl,"You're insane, you know that?"
start montage," Wanda and Sophina clean the crab with brushes and different utensils. Grandma Bonnie starts up a roux in a large skillet.  Uncle Daryl makes a large pitcher of lemonade from concentrate. Sophina and Oscar pull out glasses, dishes, and utensils for everyone. Tatiana watches Oscar closely."
grandma bonnie,"If somebody told me say twenty years ago, that I would live to see it happen, I'd have laughed in their face."
oscar,If somebody would have told me that two years ago I would have laughed in their face.
daryl,And here we are. 2008 and its happened.
ceephus,"But I think it's a sign of the times. The country is in bad enough shape for them to hand it over to a black guy. Look, if Bush hadn't have messed the country up so bad. Would he have even had a shot?"
daryl,I think he still would have had a shot.
ceephus,But would he have won though?
wanda,"Well, I'm happy the did win. If the country really is as messed up as you say, I think he's our best chance of fixing it."
sophina,I keep thinking about how much it means for T.
oscar,"When I was coming up, Teachers used to love to tell me, ""You can be the President of the United States."""
wanda,You'd make a great politician. You can talk your way out of anything.
oscar,"But I'll never forget, in my fourth grade classroom we had this poster. It had all 40 some odd presidents on that thang. And I looked at all they faces. And it was all white dudes. At that point, I realized my teachers was lying to me.  A part of me aint believed what no teacher has said to me since."
daryl,Now there will be a black face on those posters.
grandma bonnie,Well let's let him get in there first.
wanda,"I know, I still feel like it's just too good to be true."
ceephus,What's so good about it?
daryl,"A black man, one of us has been elected president, fair and square."
ceephus,But he's not one of us. He wasn't affected by slavery.
oscar,"Oh, Come'on Ma, don't mention it. You shouldn't even be doing this."
wanda,I enjoy washing dishes. It's relaxing.
oscar,I told you. I aint missin no more parties.
wanda,You guys got plans for tonight?
oscar,"Yeah, nothing major. Gonna meet up with Cato, Jack, Jason and couple other cats. Head out to the City."
wanda,You guys gonna go OUT OUT?
oscar,"Naw. We gonna keep it low key. Probably just catch the fireworks, and then roll around after that."
wanda,Roll around?
oscar,"Yeah, just chill, we'll be cool. Sophina's got work in the morning too."
wanda,You guys gonna be drinking?
oscar,I'm sure they will. I'm not gonna be drinking.
wanda,"Why don't you catch BART out there? That way you can drink and hang out, and not have to worry about anything."
oscar,Yeah we might catch BART.
wanda,No traffic either. You know its gonna be crazy. Going and coming back.
oscar,"Yeah, we might have to do it."
wanda,"Promise me, if you and your friends go, you'll catch the train.  I'm serious."
oscar,"Okay, I promise."
wanda,Aight. Don't make me follow you guys to make sure... you remember Prom.
oscar,"Alright we out, Birthday Girl. Love you."

rose,You guys let your uncle up.
oscar,Let's brush those teeth.
tatiana,No!
oscar,You want your teeth to rot? And your breath to smell like gumbo?
tatiana,Yes!
oscar,No you don't. Because then- THE GUMBO MONSTER WILL GET YOU!!!!!
oscar,What?
tatiana,"You had gumbo, too."
tatiana,You guys aren't gonna sleep over too?
oscar,Me and Mommy are gonna go see some friends for a little bit. We'll be right back.
tatiana,But I don't want you to go.
oscar,"We'll be back, in a few hours I promise."
tatiana,But you should go to bed. You already brushed your teeth. Remember?
oscar,"I know, I know. But me and Mommy promised our friends we would go and visit them. We'll be back before you wake up, okay?"
tatiana,Nooo! Don't go.

tatiana,I hear guns outside.

tatiana,But what about you daddy?
oscar,"I'll be just fine. I'll tell you what, tomorrow when we wake up, we'll play ""Candyland"". And then guess what we can do after that?"

lead surgeon,Wanda?
wanda,His lung? How is he... How is he going to be able to breathe?
lead surgeon,"Well, his breathing isn't our concern. It's the bleeding. We're working very hard to get his blood to clot. But right now, his body isn't taking the transfusions."
wanda,But he's going to make it right?
lead surgeon,"Hard to say, but we're gonna do everything we can okay?"
wanda,"Okay, okay. Please do whatever you can, okay? My son is a good boy."
