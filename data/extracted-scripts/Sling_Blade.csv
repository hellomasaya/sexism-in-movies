Speaker,Dialogue
marsha, Do you smell shit?
guard,These are the people from that newspaper deal.
woolridge,"Oh yeah, from the college?"
marsha,Yes sir.
woolridge,My name's Jerry Woolridge.
marsha,Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
woolridge,Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
marsha,Yes sir.
woolridge,"I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?"
marsha,"Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know."
woolridge,"Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?"
woolridge," I don't think he's talked to a woman in twenty-five or so years. That I know of anyway. That's why I said to send a man. At least maybe he'd answer a question or two for a man. I'm all for helping the college out, believe me. It might be a real good article or story."
woolridge," Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom."
woolridge,"His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--"
theresa,"Can I just sneak in there? I won't take any pictures, I promise. I just want to listen."
melvin,No ma'am. I'm sorry you can't.
karl, Thank you.
marsha, Thank you.
boy,Can I help you?
karl,I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
boy,"Well, what did you want?"
karl,You have any biscuits for sale?
boy,"Naw, we don't have biscuits."
karl,What you got that's good to eat?
boy,"Well, I guess it's all good."
karl,What do you like to eat here?
boy,French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
karl,French-fried potaters.
boy,Yeah.
karl,How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
boy,Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
karl,Give me the big'uns.
boy,"These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too."
karl,"What you got in there, warshing?"
boy,Yeah.
karl,Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
boy,"I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train."
karl,How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
boy,About a half a mile I think it is.
boy,Okay. You don't have to though.
boy,My name is Frank Wheatley. What's your name?
karl,Karl's my name.
karl,Childers.
frank,What are all them books?
karl,Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
karl,Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
frank,Don't you live somewhere?
karl,I did live there in the state hospital.
frank,Why'd you live there?
karl,I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
frank,They let you out?
karl,Yeah.
frank,How come?
frank,Are you well?
karl,I reckon I feel all right.
frank,You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
karl,I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
frank,"Me and the Burnett twins and some boys plays down at the junior high practice field all the time. If you ever want to come by and play. We ain't no good either. Well, I'll see you later."
woolridge,"Karl, what in the world are you doing here?"
woolridge," Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?"
karl,No thank ye.
karl,I don't reckon I know nobody name Jerry.
woolridge,"She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name."
karl,He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
daughter,Why?
woolridge,"Why, hell no, son. What's wrong with you?"
woolridge,"Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?"
karl,I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
karl,I like them french-fried potaters.
scooter,They make a good double meat burger.
bill,"All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow."
scooter," Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago."
frank,Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
karl,Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
frank,Yeah. What you doin' by here?
karl,You told me to come by.
frank,Did you want to play ball with us?
karl,I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
frank,"Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight."
karl,All right then.
karl, Pleased to know y'all.
vaughan, He just got out of the state hospital.
linda, I know.
vaughan, Karl is a guy guy?
karl, You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
karl,"Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that."
frank,He's real honest. He wouldn't steal nothin'.
linda,"Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way."
vaughan,Karl?
karl,Yes sir.
vaughan,"So, you're really going to stay here?"
karl,That boy wants me to.
vaughan,Did you knock on the door yet?
karl,"Naw, I ain't."
vaughan,How long have you been standing here?
karl,"Quite a spell, I reckon."
vaughan,"Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and get you at noon."
linda," Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?"
linda, Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
vaughan,That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
vaughan," Yeah, I knew that. You're a card all right."
doyle,"So, Karl, come have a seat, talk to me."
frank,"Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage."
doyle,"Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl."
karl,This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
doyle,What's all them books?
karl,Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
doyle,You believe in the Bible?
karl,"A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it."
frank,"Come on, Karl."
doyle, Don't tell your mama we had a little spat. She don't need to be worried with your ass.
frank,I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
karl,You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
frank,"Well, I hate him."
karl,He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
frank,Will you stay here with us for a long time?
frank,I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
karl,I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
frank,I like the way you talk.
karl,I like the way you talk.
linda,How come Karl won't eat here with us?
frank,I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
doyle,"Well, I wouldn't let it get to you."
linda,I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
doyle,Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
linda,He does make some funny noises.
frank,I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
linda,"I'm glad of it, honey."
frank,They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
linda,"He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it."
vaughan,Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
doyle," Okay now, Linda, you and the kid clean up and get a tarpaulin over this instruments. Me and the boys are goin' to the county line. We're out of liquor and beer. Come on Karl, you and Vaughan are goin' with us."
doyle,"Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work."
doyle," But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things."
doyle," Not that you afflicted sons of bitches would know anything about it, but this is art."
freddy, You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
randy,I'm in junior college right now over in Westfield.
morris,"Exactly the point, my young levelheaded friend."
morris,Not unlike Gary Brooker of the Protocol Harum.
terence,"We wrote one last night standin' outside Mini-Mart. Morris called it ""Stuart Drives a Comfortable Car."" Then, you know, like on country songs in parenthesis it says ""There is usually someone in the trunk."" I came up with a tune just humming."
doyle,"See Vaughan, you shouldn't question a genius. Morris is a modern day poet like in the old days."
vaughan,I don't really understand the meaning of the words.
the johnson, You ain't right Doyle. Somethin's wrong with you. Nobody needs your shit.
morris, The dots just look good on paper. You don't sing 'em anyway. You're showing your true Aries colors now.
vaughan,I'm a witness. I heard you threaten her life.
doyle,I thought I told you to keep out!
linda,Leave.
doyle,Don't tell me what to do.
linda,Leave.
doyle,Don't tell me what to do.
linda,Leave.
doyle,Don't tell me what to do.
linda,Leave.
doyle, Don't tell me what to do.
frank,Did Karl go to bed?
linda,"I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop."
frank,I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
linda,I know he does.
frank,Mama?
linda,Huh?
frank,Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
linda,"Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right."
frank,"Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?"
linda,"I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you."
linda, I'll be dog.
linda, Why don't we talk about something a little more festive.
karl,I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
frank,I just don't have anything to say about shoes.
melinda,"You mean about y'all bein' together in ""that"" way?"
scooter,I can go. You don't have to. You don't never go.
karl,Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
frank,"Hey Karl, you off work?"
karl,Yeah.
frank,Where'd you get them flowers?
karl,That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
frank,"I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?"
karl,Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
frank,It's name's A Christmas Carol.
karl,That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
frank,You want to go with me?
karl,Yeah.
frank,I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
karl,All right then.
frank,"Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?"
karl,"Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy."
frank,"Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers."
karl,Hit was right thoughty of her.
frank,I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
frank,You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
karl,"Yeah, I recollect it."
frank,Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
karl,If you want me to.
karl,Pull on your works. Your privates.
karl,I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
frank,Why not? It died?
karl,Yeah.
frank,Why?
karl,Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
frank,So it died when it come out?
karl,"My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel."
housekeeper," Son, I don't know why you keep comin' over here. You know these folks don't want you here. They run you off ever' time. Don't keep doin' this to yourself. You a sweet boy. Now go give them flowers to somebody that'll enjoy 'em."
frank,"Ma'am, I really want to give them to Karen."
housekeeper, You his daddy?
housekeeper, Okay.
karen, Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
frank,But maybe just for awhile --
linda,"Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long."
frank,I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
karl,Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
frank,You're strong though. You let me make them touchdowns so I'd feel good. My daddy used to do that kind of thing.
karl,No sir.
frank,"It was fun, anyhow."
karl,I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
doyle,What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
linda, Would y'all like that?
frank,Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
linda,"All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow."
frank,"Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?"
karl,Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
karl,"Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it."
karl,"Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here."
vaughan,"Karl, what are you doing here? Come in."
karl,I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
vaughan,Okay.
karl,This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
vaughan,What's wrong? Is everything okay?
vaughan,"Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?"
vaughan,"What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?"
karl,"Fact the bidness, don't you say another word to me. I ain't listenin' to you no more."
