Speaker,Dialogue
seminar presenter,"Which brings us on to Dental Insurance. Generally speaking, when you receive care from a participating PDP dentist, your out- of-pocket expenses will typically be lower than if your were to accept care from a dentist outside the group. The law deems it illegal for dentists to charge any more than the network approves... But listen, in my three and a half years of experience in this business people mainly care about keeping their premiums low. So, each of you must be prepared to sell the network to your clients and always cater to their specific condition."
james, Where's everybody?
mavis,Mr. Brown. You scared me!
james,Mavis. Where's everybody at? I got a meetin' this mornin'.
mavis,"It's Sunday, Mr. Brown."
james,"No, it's Tuesday, Mavis."
seminar presenter,"Now, understand that not all people have the same type of needs. When it comes to an insurance plan everyone is different.  3"
james,OK Stop. Sir. Stop. Who been in there?
seminar presenter,Excuse me?
james,"I own this building, someone has been in there used my commode. Now who was it?"
seminar presenter,"Sorry. We're actually renting this part of the building today, and we're in the middle of a seminar."
james,"I don't care if you're in the middle of a heart attack son. Someone been in there, I hear the chain flush, I can smell it. Now who it was?"
insurance salesman,It is. It's fuckin' him.
james,Something funny?
insurance salesman,"No, sir."
james,Then why you cats laughing?
insurance salesman,I wasn't laughing. It wasn't me. 4
seminar presenter,"Look, I suggest we just continue... OK. So. How does the program work? Initially, participating dentists undergo an extensive credentialing process which, if approved, allows customers to pay the minimum deductible allowed and the remainder is insured. But with non- participating dentists the cost per visit is much higher and comes completely out of pocket. So some people may want a high deductible because they have more to cover, but most common folks simply want the lowest possible plan... and remember our key takeaway!?"
james,OK listen up people.
insurance salesman,Don't shoot.
james,"I ain't gone shoot nobody, son."
female saleswoman,"Yes sir, Mister Brown."
james,"Yes you did. Now, don't cry. It's gone be okay."
james,Don't hurt me. Don't stop me. Don't stop me.
james,Don't stop me. Don't stop me.
james,C'mon. C'mon.

bobby,I understand you're looking for the Famous Flames.
ralph bass,I'm Ralph Bass from Federal records in Cincinnati. An imprint of King Records. I heard your acetate. I want you to come to Cincinnati. I want you to make a record for King. 61
bobby,King records. As in King Records. The King records.
ralph bass,You sure put a lot into that cut. The main vocal. You got some soul right there.
bobby,Uh.. That's not me. That's uh. That's James.
ralph bass,That you singing?

james,Wait...wait a second here-
nafloyd,What we stop for? That was cookin'.
bobby,It's OK sir we OK. We can just start right at the top.
james,It ain't right. It's too slow.     We gotta pick up the pace fellas.
bobby,"What are you doing, James? These men been doing this for a long time. We need to listen to them."
james,"I need to come in early..push it. Drive it. Early. Before the beat. Then speed it up, man."
ralph,"James, this is a ballad. The pace we've set is perfect."
james,"I know it's a ballad, Mr. Bass. But a ballad is supposed to get her in the mood, not put her to sleep."
bobby,Let's just get it done OK?
james,But it ain't right.
syd nathan, What the hell is this Ralph?! Where's the rest of the song?
ralph bass,Syd-
syd nathan,"He just keeps hollering that one word over and over. ""Please"". ""Please"" what, Ralph?! Please jerk my dick? What the hell does he want? If he doesn't tell me, you're fired."
ralph,"Listen, Mr. Nathan. This song-"
syd nathan,I don't hear a song Ralph. A song has verses. A snappy chorus. It's not just some unfortunate nigger pleading. Who needs that? Give me the fucking song Ralph. The song.
ralph,It's not about the song.
syd nathan,What?
ralph,It's not the song.
cut to:,64
james,Please!   Please!   Please.
crowd,"James Brown, James Brown, James Brown."
james,Please!   Please!   Please!
ralph,James. I want you to meet somebody.
bart,That was a great show last week over in Jersey.
james,"Well thank you Sir, we worked real hard to-"
bart,Not we James. Not the Famous Flames. You. James Brown.
ralph,What Bart is saying James is-
james,I know what Mr. Bart is saying. I heard him. Loud and clear.
ben bart,Come in Boys. Come in.
bobby,I don't understand. Is this some sort of mistake?
nafloyd, His Famous Flames?
baby roy,"Sir, this ain't right."
ben bart,"We agree. See I believe it should say simply James Brown. The fact is Gentlemen, James Brown doesn't need the Famous Flames. King records and Universal don't need the Famous Flames. But James has requested that the name remain in some form. Now if you want to stay, stay, but from now on you work for James Brown, on James Brown's records. Should you find this disagreeable in part or whole, you can go home."
nafloyd, James?
james,Bobby. It's just a name. Ain't nothing different between us. This for all us not just me. It's gone be good.
nafloyd,James Brown. I never liked you. Come on. Let's get outta here.. 67
bart,So. Do you know what you want James?
young james, I know exactly what I want.
syd nathan,Forget it. King doesn't make live albums. They're too expensive.
james,I think a live album-
syd nathan,"James, your audience is Negro. Negroes don't buy albums. They don't have the resources. Especially not for a bunch a songs they already got."
ben bart,"James, Recording live is five, six times as expensive as the studio. And that's for some violin concerto at the Met. No one jumps up and shouts ""Blow it fucker!"" in the middle of The Magic Flute."
james,"But, Pop, you know my show."
syd,Don't need to.
james,Mr. Nathan-
syd,"The ""Mashed Potato""."
james,"That ain't the ""Mashed Potato""."
syd,Exactly.
syd nathan,So I stick to what I know. You stick to what you know. And that's the showbusiness.
james,Book the Apollo. I'm gonna spend my own money on this. Syd Nathan's wrong.
ben bart,"I'm not going to let you do that, Jimmy. 69"
james,"Book it out next week for the whole week, go in, we drill it, we drill it, we drill it, then we drop it."
ben bart,"Forget it, Jimmy. It's too big of a risk. Let's order something to eat."
james,I don't understand risk?
ben bart,"Of course not, Jimmy."
james,"Sure it is. That's all me and my black brothers are to the ""White Devil"". We the show and you the money. And that's how the White Devil keeps it all."
ben bart,"I'm not the ""White Devil"". I'm trying to protect you. I'm doing my job."
james,"Pop, look me in the eye."
ben bart,I'll call Nola Sound. They got these new three track stereo recorders from Ampex.
james,"And I want the best engineer in town. I don't care what it takes. I don't care what it cost. I want everyone in uniform, the ushers, front of house, the peanut peddlers."
ben bart,We'll need the band in New York immediately.
james,And I want `em in Sapphire blue suits. Pop. Sapphire.
ben bart,Sapphire Blue. Underwear too. How does that sound?
james,It's cold. It's cold. It's too cold man. It's too cold. Cold. Cold.
gertrude,"Evening, Mr. Brown. Cold out tonight."
james,Gertrude. See if you can get some coffee for the folks in line.
james,You ready Mr. Byrd?
bobby byrd, Ready Mr. Brown.
syd,We got the level on his main mic way up to drown out the crowd. You gotta get him to hold back a little in the first number!
ben bart,"I think its too late for that. You ain't got a breeze, Syd. You got a hurricane."
james,Watch me.

james,Think...Think...Think...About your bad self...
james,Thank you. That's very kind of you.
bobby,Gertrude. Get everybody out.
gertrude,What?
james,We gone celebrate tonight. And then tomorrow we gone Wilmington and do it to it all over again. 74
bobby,"Mr. Brown. Excuse me. Mr. Brown.  There's a woman here, Mr. Brown. She says she's your mother.  James stops dead. COMPLETELY STILL. We push in. He doesn't blink."
james,Momma?

young james,But Momma!
soldier,Get the fuck out of here.
aunt honey,"Don't cry, Little Junior. Don't cry. Now, child, I want you to listen to me. You gone be okay. You hear me? Little Junior, you were born dead. Did you know that?"
maceo,Who's this?
bobby bennet, James gone wear that seat out.
maceo,Which seat. Her's or the bus? 76
yvonne,I'm Yvonne! I'm a singer. Let me worry about my seat.
bart,Compliments of Universal Attractions.
james,This for me? Looky this! We got us a chauffeur.
james,"Pop, see there's something I been meaning to ask you."
bart,What's that Jimmy.
james,"I got a seventh grade education Pop, so you'll have to excuse me. I was looking over those figures you sent me, and something occur to me: we don't pay the promoter, the promoter pay us."
bart,Just standard Jimmy. Guarantee against fluctuating ticket sales. Lets plan a-
james,"-sure we planning, see I ask myself, what if we don't got fluctuating sales. What if you knocking the tar out of every show."
bart,Well let me explain the way it works. When you book a show. Take Chicago. Now our promoter in Chicago is-
james,I don't doubt it.
bart,"Now when Lenny pays us a flat rate, we can account. You know, number one, you're getting top rate and number two-"
james,What if we took the gate?  78
ben bart,Better than Lenny Franks?
james,"Lenny Franks a James Brown fan? How old he, sixty? Why's he gone try harder for James Brown than for Sam Cooke? Or Ray Charles. Or Tom Jones. See Pop. We go to the radio stations."
bart,"Jimmy, I understand your frustration but you gotta realize you're entering a game where the rules are set out. If you were a ball player you can't walk in and change how many innings they're gonna play just because..."
james,You see my point right? OK. Listen up. We go to the radio station. We go to the young cats. The hungry cats. The late night cat.
james,The twenty year old white deejay in Richmond Virginia who's getting paid nothing and is only doin' it because he loves music. We go to him we ask him if he want to be the sole James Brown promoter for the Richmond show. For a percentage. He gone say:
james,Between nothing and fifty bucks a week. But he love my music. He digs James Brown. And he got a microphone and a turn-table and four hours airtime to kill.
james,And at the end he gone say..
james,Now because he's twenty he's got strong legs. And he knows everyone.
james," That way we get our record played outside Payola, we get our show promoted better, harder, cheaper, and we keep the gate."
james, What'd you think Pop?
bart,Its beautiful Jimmy. I can't do it.
james,Why not?
bart,Universal Attractions promotes many acts. I can't piss off the 60 or 70 promoters in this country to skim a little extra on the James Brown Show.
james,"It's not a little. If the show sells, and it's sellin', we talking thousands of dollars a night. Difference per year between 2 and 3 million dollars."
bart,And I'm out of a job. Think you're forgetting I don't just work for James Brown.
james,And there's my next point Pop. Why not?  81
ben bart," I thank you for the fish. And I'm gonna need some benefits, boss."
bart,Po-lice have the same problem.
james,Who you play Sax with son?
james,What's the rule?
james,"Not on the bus. Not backstage. You a talented horn player, son. You gotta keep your game tight. Now you wanna smoke a little groove on your own time, that's yo' business. But we out here to work hard and we gone do just that you dig? Fifty. 83"
james,"I called you yesterday, you ain't home."
dede,I was home all day.
james,You were home all day. So why you didn't pick up the phone?
dede,I don't know. What time you call?
james,"I call you at one and quarter past one, then I call you at two. And I call again at three."
dede,You must've wanted to talk to me pretty bad.
james,Where were you? 84
dede,Yesterday. I don't know..in the bath?
james,For two hours?
dede,"You want me to take shorter baths? You don't have a phone in the bathroom, James. What you gonna do? Fine me?"
james,"I ain't gone fine you, baby.   You fine enough already."
dede,"Then get over here, Mr. Dynamite."
james,Got you a phone in the bathroom now.
dede,Keep your eyes closed Bobby. Keep `em closed.
bobby byrd,"They're closed, Dede."
james,You peekin' brother? OK. OK.  Check it Bobby. Is that something?
bobby,Yeah brother. That's something.
velma,Hey Bobby.
james,Impetigo?
dede,It's a skin infection. 86
velma,All that mess round his mouth. That's impetigo. It's highly infectious.
dede,"Thank you, Velma. I'll consider myself warned."
velma,"Warned? Oh, that's a whole other conversation. Welcome to the family."
james,Listen up. Which one of you cats want to fly to Reno on daddy's airplane?
velma,I'll let you know. I'm putting a big list together right now.
interviewer,"Welcome to Reno, Mr. Brown. What exactly do you call your style of music?"
james brown,"I call it James Brown music. What I mean is, it's so far ahead of it's time that they ain't got a name for it yet. Take another record, any record from your stack at home. I don't care if it's from Motown or Stax or whatever...and put it on your box. None of them are gonna sound like mine. Not even my own old records. Just like the title says, it's a ""new bag"". See the funk is in the bass. The bass never changes. It's a groove, lady. Soon as you hear that groove, I know I got you."
interviewer,And what exactly is the groove?
james brown,"The groove is something you feel. The groove is solid. Bam Bap. It don't move. It's like a heartbeat. It's inside you, driving everything. Hard. Flat. A groove."
interviewer,But how exactly do you define it?
james brown,"I just did.  See Miss. See there's some things, they're just too big to fit in a magazine. But we all feel it. Even little Teddy here know it when he feel it."
teddy,"""Um Booga Chooca"" 88"
james brown,See. Right there. We all feel it together. And that's the groove. Understand?
interviewer, So what's your favorite food?
bart,"Then we got a day between Raleigh, Carolina and Columbia two days after."
james,Day off?
bart,Sure. Regroup. Rest the horses.
james,"We ain't payin' the horses to rest `em. Besides, we got a day off in two weeks in New Orleans. The boys can get their wives, girlfriends along, kick back. What's between Raleigh and Columbia? Spartanburg?"
bobby byrd,"Well see, James started out in Augusta. Then his family moved to Toccoa. That's where we met."
journalist,"And tell me about James' first band, the Famous Flames. 89"
bobby byrd,"Well there was five of us to start with. Nafloyd Scott, Baby Roy Scott, Sylvester Keels.."
journalist,And they left...
bobby byrd,Yeah. They left.
james, Bobby? What's the name of the theater in Spartanburg...
bobby,Uh.. The Viceroy. The..
james,The Regal!
bobby,Yeah. That's it. The Regal.
james," On Howard Street and main. Hold about 750 people. Guy named Bennett used to own it. Yeah, Spartanburg. Yeah, we'll play there and I can bring in my masseuse from Anderson."
journalist,Wow. He's got an amazing memory.
bobby,Yeah. James remembers everything. 90
james,"Hey little man, you been good this year."
little boy,"Yes, Mister Brown."
james,"Merry Christmas, Little Man."
dede,"Great crowd today, Baby. 91"
husband," Honey, his hands are tied. The pool area has been reserved for a private function."
wife,We're good people and we've paid good money. We didn't come all the way to New Orleans to swim in a pool full of-
husband,WIFE  Niggers.                          Entertainers.
vicki anderson,You a bad man Bobby Byrd.
pee wee,Fella's this is Fred. I thought we'd show him how things work?
bobby,Means less sharp. Bring it down.
maceo,Mean I give it some heat.
all,On the one.
all,Take it to the bridge.
maceo,What about when he do this..?
pee wee,That'll be ten thousand dollars.
bobby,When?
pee wee,Now.    We gotta go get dressed.
maceo,You're kidding. Tell me you kidding.
james,"See My great grandmother on my momma's side, she Asian. She got Asian blood. See Asians are a flexible race. You get with an Asian chick? That a whole other story. No spank but they got it baby they got it. Anyway what was I talkin `bout?"
maceo,Your Chinese knees Mr. Brown.
james,That's right. That it. I got these Chinese knees.  95
maceo, No Sir. I ain't lost no feeling.
james," Is something wrong, Maceo?"
bobby byrd,James-
james,You got something to say Mr. Byrd?  Because a man got something to say he should say it. You got something to say?
bobby byrd,"Yes, Mr. Brown."
james,Good. I ain't fattening frogs for snakes. From the top. One Two...
james brown,Quit it.  Clyde man. Lets get that POP! Dee.. app..POP! Unnerstand? It drop before you reach the beat. Dig?
maceo, Does he mean top of the bar?
pee wee, He means the down beat.
james,"It goin' wrong there Pee Wee, when it rise up."
maceo,But Mr. Brown.
james brown, Did I say change the part? Don't change the part. How many records you got?
james,Thank you! I like the part he playin' now. I just want it in a different place.
james,A snare what?
james,Correct.
maceo,"Guitar, Mr. Brown."
james,No it's not.
james,Now you're getting it.
pee wee,A drum?
james,You Fellas. What are those shiny things you holding.
james,"Now we all got our drums. Now when you're playing the drum it don't matter what key you're in, what bar your in or what planet you on. Dig?"
maceo, But Mr. Brown.
james brown,But does it sound good?
james brown,Mmmn! Huh! Now that a groove.
maceo,"Bobby, James Brown's my meal ticket. So I just shut my ears and chomp down his bullshit. But why you soak it up man? You his best friend. You know him for time brother. And he treat you like that. I was you I'd bust him in his damn mouth."
bobby byrd,I hang in there cause I remember the day that I knew. Knew I was never gonna be in front.
maceo,You sure you just ain't too scared to be in the front?
bobby byrd,"No. But my ears a' open. Open your ears, Maceo. He's a genius. And he's takin' us with him."
james,"Mother, she got to have. Say, you got to have a mother for me. Yeah, popcorn!"
pee wee,Mr. Brown?
james,What is it? Why we stop Henry?
bobby byrd,It's King. They shot Dr. King.
bart,"Jimmy, Mayor of Boston's office called. Wanted you to know they've cancelled tomorrow's show at the Garden. For reasons of public safety. He's worried about rioting. 102"
james brown,"Tell the Mayor, I sold 30 million records and ninety five percent of them are to the black community. They listen to me. They won't riot"
bart,"We have virtual race war looming across the South, Jimmy. Politics, 101? Don't put 10,000 angry blacks together in one place in the middle of a city, and broadcast it live to the world."
james,Get the Mayor on the phone.
james,"Mr. Mayor, the way I see it, you already lost your next election. You lost it at 7:05 PM Memphis time."
james,"Now tomorrow night, you either got 10,000 angry folks in the Boston Garden, or you got 10,000 angry folks on your front lawn. Take your pick son. Which one you want?"
mayor,"All of us are here to night to listen to a great talent. James Brown. But we're also here to pay tribute to one of the greatest Americans, Dr. Martin Luther King. So, let us look at each other and pledge that whatever else any other community might do we in Boston will honour Dr. King in peace."
james,Brother before I get to this next thing I wanna say. He's a young man you dig. He's a young man so he's thinking together. The man is together. Give him another round of applause.
mayor,Oh no. 104
james,Wait a minute. Step off. Move off. I'll be a'ight here. I be fine.
mayor, Holy shit. He did it. 105
dede, Of course he did.  Dede smiles proudly.  I Don't Want Nobody To Give Me Nothing kicks in over intercut Archival footage of Newscasters discussing the last minute decision for the concert to go ahead.
james,"You got kids out there that can't eat, robbing and stealing and doing what they have to do to make it. And if you don't do something about it we gonna lose the country. I go to Harlem, talk to Rap Brown, talk to the Nation they call me a separatist. Here we're on our way to the White House, Pop, and they already calling me an Uncle Tom. So what I supposed to do?  106"
bart,It says you kissin' up to the Man James.
james,You asking me to turn this plane around and stand up the President?
bart,"No. I'm saying who gives a shit. You're already screwed, James. Think about it.   If you stand up Lyndon Johnson to go kiss up to the Panthers, you ain't gone be playin' Vegas anytime soon because if they think you can stop a riot, they sure as hell will expect you to start one."
james,"So here I am. Just a sorry soul brother whining inside his private jet, huh?"
bart,"Don't be scared my friend. Because if you're scared, it doesn't end well for the black man. Do your thing, James.  It's worked for you so far."
james,"I want to go to Vietnam. I want to show unity for the boys out there. The beleaguered, the tired and in the dark.  107"
james,Take it and flip it.
james,Hit it.
maceo,You think they fuck up he gone take they pocket money.
james,We ready fellas?
children,I'm Black and I'm Proud!
james,"You the man, Teddy Brown?"
teddy,"I'm the man, Mr. Brown."
james,Gertie. The band ready?
gertrude,They're ready Mr. Brown.
james brown,Don't look like it.
james brown,Y'all act like y'all don't know what time it is. What you doin'?
maceo,I've been elected spokesman to speak on behalf of the band.
james,Spokesman? Elected?
maceo,We asked to get paid on time. We haven't been paid in weeks. We asked for scheduled days off. Every day off we get you make us rehearse.. We asked to get paid for recording but you included it in our salary.
james brown,"Teddy, go on and wait outside."
teddy,"Yes, Sir."
james,"Fellas. I hear ya. I really do. And I appreciate the honesty. That can't be easy. No Sir. You got grievances. You got your own selves to think about. Hell, you're men. I dig it."
pee wee,I don't think you understand.
maceo,"We know you owe the government back taxes. Your restaurant, radio stations, recording studios, labels, all different businesses, Unaccounted cash passing between them.  112"
james brown,I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna think about it. That's all.
james," It's like I always say Bobby. You gotta know who you are. You got to know where you are in this world. Five minutes ago, those boys were the best band on the planet. Now they nothing. Now they a bunch of sidemen with their hearts beatin' fast. Maceo comin' in here talking about my taxes. All I've done for this country and they comin' after James Brown? How you gone keep everybody happy? Huh? And stay on top? You along for the ride while everything is groovy and now they gone kick me when I'm down? People either on the bus or they off it."
james brown, Well go on. Get out of here. Y'might catch `em they gone need a singer.
bobby,"Negro, what makes you think I'm leaving? I been here all the time, Mr. Brown. I'm still here."
james,See that's the thing about the funk. The funk don't quit.
bobby,Last time I checked.
james,Cause if the funk gone up'n'quit that's it.
bobby,That's why the funk don't quit.
james,Are we done here Mr. Byrd?
bobby,I'm afraid we ain't Mr. Brown.
james,Are we done?
bobby,I think we got more funk in the trunk.
james,That's right. Two Musketeers.
bobby, Bootsy. 114
catfish,Fancy suit bro'.
bootsy,"Backatcha slick. How you doin, Chicken?"
chicken,Just shit my pants.
bootsy,Easy now. Don't forget. Don't ever call him James or nothin'. He ain't no-one but Mr. Brown.
james,Do that button up son.  You know Cold Sweat? Do you know Please Please?
bootsy,Can I stop you Mr. Brown. We been learning off yo' records since we was nine years old. You already taught us the songs. So with respect. We ready. Mr. Brown.
james,They say they ready Mr. Byrd. What you think? 115
catfish,"We been waiting for this moment our entire lives, Mr. Brown."
james,How old are you son?
catfish,Twenty.  Mr. Brown.
james,Cats know Super Bad?
yvonne,Why won't you say it? I said it. Why won't you say it back?
james,"Baby, I gotta get to my show. I can't be playin' around right now"
yvonne,I love you.
james,You know I don't drink.
yvonne,"Say it, Mr. Brown. Say you love me."
james,Happy now? 116
yvonne,I'm pregnant.
james,"Now it's true, we work hard. A man gotta work hard if he wanna break ground. And we breaking new ground everyday..."
james,My record Live at the Apollo is the first R&B album in the history of the world to go top ten. Stayed up in there for 66 weeks..
james,"And slowly, the whole World knew who we were.  James walks to each band member and places a twenty dollar bill in each of their pockets. They don't see the James who is talking directly to us.  He straightens a band members tie. James turns to stage left and sees his son, Teddy Brown, dancing. He then gives Yvonne a wink who's also standing in the wings looking HOT.  JAMES  You better believe. You looking at both.  He spins around and runs up to the microphone.   He replaces himself and begins to sing.  SCREAMS. HORNS VAMPING. James performs out of his skin. A medley of three songs, ""Soul Power,"" into ""Sex Machine,"" into ""Super Bad"".  Backup dancers and singers are tearing it up!  On James' signal the rag tag band of kids behind the godfather of soul take off like a rocket ship into one of the above songs. It sounds nothing like the old version. Its raw urgent, stripped down. The Bootsy's bass rumbles like trouble brewing and Catfish's over driven guitar slicing clean through the hook.  Before them a standing room crown dance and sing from the stage to all the way back to entrance  James and Bobby look at each other. Holy shit.  James drops into the splits, flips up again.  The crowd is seeing something for the first time on European soil. They erupt with joy and begin dancing in their seats.  CUT TO:"
bobby,"You know what I think? After we put out my next solo album, I bet I could play Paris or the Apollo."
james brown,How's that?
bobby,"I was just saying when me and you put out my new record, I bet I could fill this place all myself. No problem."
james brown,"What the hell you talking about? ""Fill this place all myself""? ""No problem?"" You sayin' I'm slippin'?"
bobby byrd,No I don't think you slippin'.   You James Brown. You ain't never slippin'. I was just...
james brown,"People copy me, Mr. Byrd. People gonna copy my moves till the earth goes dark. You understand? You think people are gonna buy that record like they buy my record? That what you sayin'?"
bobby,No.
james brown,Who you been tellin' this too? You been telling that to the Apollo?
bobby,"No, James! I haven't told nobody but you. We were just talking.  119"
james brown,"Bobby, how you gone stand on your own feet? You just spent twenty years gettin' fat on a man's dollar. I produce a record for you and now it's gone to your head. You go talking big behind my back. You go sneaking round, raising heat off another man's name. We here, we doing something and you making plans sucker?"
bobby, I ain't told nobody or made any plans. We just talkin' about it. Now. That's it.
james,"I'm ashamed of you, Bobby. And you should be ashamed of you. Now you tryin' to run around with Vicki. Don't jive yourself bro'. Now, Vicki, she could fill this place."
bobby,"Well, Vicki ain't yours. So, Vicki and me ain't none of your damn business."
james,But she's been my business before.
bobby,"I can't do this no more, James."
james brown,Damn right you can't do this no more. 120
bobby,I said I can't do this no more.
james brown,"See, the funny part. You say that like it's a big thing. Like ""oh my God, Bobby Byrd gone leave James Brown on his own."""
bobby,"I ain't leaving you on your own, Mr. Brown. You already on your own. Always were."
james,Bobby? Get everybody out of here and wait outside.
susie,"I was on the Subway last week, and the two kids next to me was arguing who was the best, James Brown or Little Willy John. And this one boy, he was saying ""James Brown the best"" ""There ain't no one better than James Brown"", he got so mad I thought he was gonna whup this other boy. And then-"
james,Why tonight?  Why you come here?
susie,"Well. Sugar, I live over in Brooklyn... and you my baby and you here playin' the Apollo."
james,"I don't want you to feel proud. I ain't your sugar. I ain't your baby. Not then. Not now. And I don't want you to tell anyone you my momma, because you and me know that ain't true."
susie,Your daddy beat me. Beat you. I stayed because I loved you. I didn't know nothin' about being a wife. Nothin' about being a mother. I did the best I could. I did that.  122
james,See I thought about this. I know it weren't personal and that's why this ain't neither. It turned out fine. I didn't need you. I looked after James Brown. Made sure he was OK. No-one else. No-one help me.
susie,"I never wanted to be a momma. But I carried you, boy. I didn't know nothin' about being a wife or being a momma. But I carried you and I loved you when you were in me. I chose you. I chose you."
james,Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry.
susie,You're so beautiful. You're so pretty.
james,Tell Pop to make sure she's taken care of. Whatever she needs.
james,I'm OK. I'm OK. I'm OK.
loud hailer,EXIT THE VEHICLE WITH YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD. DO NOT RUN. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO START THE VEHICLE.

james,"You know, Bobby, they still don't know what happened to Teddy and that boy. Those boys weren't drinkin' or doin' drugs."
bobby,"I know, James."
james,No sir. Nothin' like that. He was a good boy. The car just hit that bridge head on. We ain't ever gone know how or why. They say he didn't feel a thing.
bobby,"That's good, James."
james,But we brought him back to Augusta didn't we? Got him home then sent him on to the Lord.
bobby,"We did, Mr. Brown.    We did."
