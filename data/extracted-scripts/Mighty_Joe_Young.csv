Speaker,Dialogue
august 1997,Final Production Draft
for educational,PURPOSES ONLY
ruth,Jill.   What did I tell you?
jill,But Joe started it!
ruth,"It's not good for them to interact with us.  Besides, that wasn't Joe. It was Marley."
jill,No it wasn't.    It was Joe.
ruth,"Joe is just a baby, Jill.      He was too big to be Joe."
jill,Check.   Check the pictures.
mountain range, The dark peaks silhouetted against the stellar glow.
pov shot," Charging THROUGH dense, primeval forest. We hear an eerie metallic JANGLE of what sounds like wind chimes riding right with us. Something is moving quickly up this mountain."
clearing, A small circle of huts forming a campsite around a night fire. We go inside...  one of them --
ruth,"Jill, what made you think the gorilla we saw today was Joe?"
jill,"I was right, wasn't I?"
ruth,"My notes say that Joe is only six months old. Either I got confused, or he's a very unusual gorilla."
jill, I told you so.
ruth,"Yes, you did. And Mommy's going to write it down in her book."
ruth,"Right here. '... and my trusted colleague, Dr. Jill Young, showed me the error of my ways.'"
ruth,Now go to sleep.
ruth," 'Sleep till the night ends, the night wind will sing for you. Your song and my song. It goes on forever.'"
jill,"Goodnight, Kweli."
ruth,Kweli?   What is it?
kweli,You should come. Quickly.
jill,"Mommy, can I..."
ruth,"Stay here, Jill."
kweli," Stay here, child."
ruth, Poachers.
ruth, Let's go.
africans,... n'gai zamu!... n'gai zamu!...
garth,They're at it again.
strasser,Mystical nonsense. There's only one thing they should be afraid of on this mountain.  And it's staring them right in the face!
garth,Gorilla.   We're close.
joe's pov," A nightmarish collage of images accompanied by the CLANGING of the dogs' COLLARS, the charge of the African poachers, the SCREAMS of the MOTHER and the other GORILLAS. Then he sees Strasser run forward, raise his rifle with icy precision."
through scope," Strasser has Joe's mother dead on. Her head in the cross-hairs as she tries to get away. The MOTHER'S raspy animal SCREAM is unmistakably maternal, heart-breaking. It ECHOES across the mountain as she tries to reach a deep stretch of woods.  On her back, Joe turns once more to look back and sees --"
on joe," We see Joe thrown THROUGH FRAME, tumbling into the high grass.  Then, silence."
garth, Get the baby!
strasser, Don't shoot it! They want the babies alive!! Bring the sack!
joe's pov," THROUGH the tall grass in the b.g., he can see the Africans disappear up the hill hunting down the others."
another pov, Something is running TOWARDS her.
jill's pov," of Strasser's and Garth's boots. Jill can hear the sound of their voices, but their words are indistinct."
strasser, She's got to be here somewhere. She's got that damn devil with her.
garth, I think you might've hit the woman.
strasser," These people want to live like heroes, let them die like heroes."
strasser,That little demon took off my damn trigger finger.  Monstrule!
garth,Your little 'monster' couldn't have gone far. Want to keep looking or...?
strasser, No.    Let's get out of here.
jill,Mom!
jill," Mom, there were men, they..."
ruth,"I know, I know. Shhh."
ruth,"Oh, look who it is.    Hello, Joe. "
jill,He's scared.
ruth,Poor baby.   He lost his mommy tonight.
ruth,"He needs someone to protect him. Will you do that for me, Jill?"
ruth,"Promise me you'll protect him, Jill."
jill,I... I promise.
kweli,"Don't worry, little one.   I will take care of you."
kweli,"You will love living in the village. There are other children, and..."
kweli,Jill!
on kweli," Starting after her at first, but then stopping.    He lets her go.  CUT TO: 11B.  A14   EXT. PANGANI FOREST - DAY                                       A14  Jill pushes her way through the brush, finding Joe, waiting for her."
on jill," Joe in her arms now, running through the woods as fast as she can, and we PULL BACK and...  DISSOLVE TO:"
humvee," racing at breakneck speed over the dirt highway. Driven by GREGG O'HARA -- anyone would consider him young, strong and handsome -- except that right now, it's all hidden under the grime from a long flight and a week's growth of beard. Hair long, unkempt; clothes wrinkled.  Gregg passes four local men burning a clearing in the woods for yet more farmland.  Pushing its way up the mountain side. The humvee is packed with EQUIPMENT that RATTLES as Gregg hits every bump in the road."
gregg,You must be Pindi.
pindi,"The one and only, bro."
pindi,"Six men, three cars... everything you ask for, Mr. Ohara.  All paid for in advance, out of Pindi's pocket..."
gregg,Sweet-looking bunch of guys.
gregg,I asked for experienced trackers.
pindi,These men are the best -- I assure you. Very best.
pindi,"Nice piece you got there. What are we hunting, elephants?"
gregg,We're not hunting anything.
pindi,Ah! Tranquilizer darts. I agree -- much nicer to animals than bullets.
gregg," Your men know how to use this, right?"
pindi,"Oh sure, boss.     Only professionals here."
pindi,"So tell me, boss -- where are we going today?"
gregg,There.
pindi,"There? Uh, boss, that is not such a good mountain. The men don't like it very much at all. You see there is a legend they believe in, that a creature lives there..."
gregg,'N'Gai Zamu.' The sacred guardian of Mount Pangani.
pindi,"You know it? How funny!  That's not, by any chance, what you are looking for, is it, boss?"
gregg,Looking for a legend?   No.   Why would I do that?
gregg,Gimme those.
pindi,What are you listening to?
gregg,Sounds.
pindi,Like that right there?
gregg,Yup.
pindi,"I understand completely: jungle sounds! Very important. I know a guy, he can get you a C.D. of jungle sounds, cheap. Even cheaper if you buy ten."
pindi," How do you like that, boss? I told you these men were the best."
gregg, You're a beauty.
gregg," Okay, set him free."
pindi, Why ask for a cage if you are not keeping the animal?
gregg,Because I'm only keeping this.
pindi,"Yes, but I know a guy, in Botswana, he'd pay you ten thousand American dollars for that leopard. I'd be willing to split with you -- fifty/fifty."
pindi,"Perhaps you're right. Sixty to you, forty to me. That's a very fair deal!"
pindi,"My goodness -- you're an excellent negotiator. Okay, boss! Seventy/thirty it is.  Take him to the truck."
gregg,Put the cat down... now.
pindi, They never understand me. I don't know what to do...
pindi,"Uh, excuse me.     Time to flee, right?"
gregg,Don't anybody move.
pindi, How about... I move... just over here...
gregg,Come on!!   We're going after him!
pindi,What is this 'we'? There is no way my men will ever agree to...
gregg, Triple your fee.
gregg,Herd him towards me!   I gotta get close.
gregg,Real close.
another angle," The lead car, a Land Rover, comes right up behind Joe."
land rover, The guy with the tranquilizer RIFLE panics and FIRES!
gregg,"Experienced trackers, my ass!"
gregg,"No, we don't want to..."
gregg,Hold the wheel!
their pov," Joe has just emerged from the tree stand, dragging the thoroughly-battered, modified Land Rover and its dazed occupants. Joe sees the humvee heading towards him."
pindi,"I hope you are planning on throwing that at him, because..."
gregg,Pindi!   Look out!
the chain," Pulled taut between Joe and the modified Land Rover, has become a moving clothesline, and the humvee is heading right into its path. Pindi tries to swerve, but they can't avoid it. He ducks and...  Gregg leaps out of the car, hurdling the chain, just as...  It shears the top right off the vehicle!  Gregg tumbles to the ground, as the humvee rolls to a stop nearby. Meanwhile, the --"
land rover," is SPINNING OUT, still connected to Joe. Joe is almost curious about the chain. He begins to pull back as the modified Land Rover circles him. The modified Land Rover bucks -- and for a second there is a standstill. Then Joe yanks...                                                  23  And the chain, the winch, the tracker in the hot seat... in fact, the entire axle of the modified Land Rover, are pulled from their moorings.  The tracker racks up against a tree, followed closely by his chair and winch...  The axle tumbles to a stop...  The LAND ROVER COLLAPSES like a stack of cards."
joe," stands at the edge of the field, observing his victory. Then he beats his chest and ROARS."
pindi,Stop!
pindi,"Hurry up, bro!     Get in!"
pindi,"Excuse me, boss, but please, I would like to avoid being killed."
gregg,Get those men down the mountain. They need help.
pindi,Crazy Americans!
pindi,Get us out of here.
gregg's pov," Staring down the path of crushed growth that Joe has left in his wake. He takes a deep breath, then exhales. Then he heads off into the jungle."
gregg," screams as he's jerked helplessly into the air. Joe shakes Gregg viciously -- then whips him back and forth, knocking him against a sapling. Gregg fights to free himself but he's no match for Joe's strength. He knows Joe is going to hurt him badly -- maybe kill him.  Joe cocks his arm -- to crush Gregg against a wide tree trunk.  Joe!   Stop!  Joe looks surprised, caught with his hand in the cookie jar."
gregg,"Oh, wow."
jill,Joe...
jill,... drop him.
pov shot," LOOKING UP AT KWELI, 12 years older than we last saw him. Kweli looks right INTO CAMERA, then says something over his shoulder in Swahili."
gregg,Where am I?
kweli,The infirmary. You've been unconscious for an entire night. You're lucky to be alive.
gregg,"Strange, I don't feel lucky."
kweli,You crashed your vehicle. It is waiting for you outside.
gregg,You're an injury behind. The kicker was getting dropped on my head by N'gai Zamu.
gregg,Think that's funny? You should try it?
kweli,"N'Gai Zamu is just a legend, my friend."
gregg,"No, he's a giant gorilla with a mean backhand. There was also a woman..."
kweli,A woman?
gregg,Out in the jungle. She saved my life. A beautiful woman.
kweli,"You were dreaming, Mr. Ohara."
gregg,No.    I never remember my dreams.
kweli,It would be wise for you to see a doctor in Kimjayo. I took the liberty of calling one for you.
gregg,Don't need one.
kweli,"But he is expecting you. If you can drive, you should leave today."
gregg,Damnit.
school children,Hello!    Hello!     Hello!
gregg's pov," as Kweli steps into a fruit stall, letting the kids fly by him.  Then Gregg's eyes widen as a tall and lovely young woman steps INTO VIEW next to Kweli."
kweli,Our visitor must be feeling better. He should be leaving the infirmary today.
jill,Looks like he just has.
jill,He's walking so soon. Joe should have dropped him harder.
kweli,"He's not a poacher, Jill. He's working for an animal conservancy in California."
jill, He can't be trusted.   He's an outsider.
kweli,A grateful outsider. He told me he was saved yesterday by a woman.  A beautiful woman.
jill,And what did you tell him?
kweli,What could I tell him? He knows what he saw. He's not a fool.
jill,I'll be the judge of that.
gregg," watches this bizarre ritual, wondering what Jill could possibly be doing.  CUT TO:"
on gregg, The thunderous sound making him nervous...
jill," Hey, handsome. How are you?"
jill,"What were you thinking yesterday, letting those men see you? Don't do that again, okay? Please.  Please."
jill,One.   Two.   Three. Four...
jill,"... seven, eight, nine, ten.  Ready or not, here I come!!"
jill," Oh, my God! I can't find Joe. Where's Joe?"
jill,"Come out, come out... wherever you are!"
jill,I found you!
jill,"Bye-bye, Joe!"
gregg,Oh boy.
jill,"Now get out of here, Joe.     Run."
jill,"Run, Joe.   Run!"
gregg, Nobody better try and tell me I imagined this.
jill,Anything broken?
gregg, No... no. I think I'm... oh.
jill,Hmm -- it looks okay.     I think it's still working.
gregg, Oh -- good.
jill,Well -- I can fix that.
gregg, Hey -- wait a minute!
gregg,Hang on a second -- what's the problem?
jill,You. You're the problem. That's the second time I've stopped you from being ripped in two -- and next time I'm just going to watch. Understand?
gregg, You saved me. I'm grateful. Now I just want to talk to you -- Miss Young.
gregg,I know who you are. I read all your mother's work. Books... notes... everything I could get a hold of.
jill, So?
gregg,So it's why I'm here.
gregg,She knew about Joe? Did she have a theory on him? How old is he? I can't believe you kept him a secret all these years. How'd you manage that?
jill,By keeping people like you off the mountain.
gregg,You got this all wrong.   I want to help you.
jill,You're not helping anybody here. You're just making matters worse.
gregg,How's that?
jill,"This mountain will be crawling with people, thanks to you. You go back to wherever you're from, put the word out..."
gregg,"The word is out. It's done. I'm not the only one who saw him, remember? Rare animals mean big money and Joe's as rare as they come. It's going to be tough to protect him here. Maybe impossible."
jill,'Here' is Joe's home. And 'here' is where he must live. He doesn't have a choice.
gregg,That's not true. Place that sent me could take care of Joe. They got the facilities...
jill,Just what Joe needs.   A cage.
gregg,"Not a cage, a preserve. A place where he'll be free from poachers, free from land development..."
jill,But he won't be free.
gregg,How long do you think Joe will stay free here? I'm telling you there's gonna be a hunt starting on this mountain tomorrow. And I don't expect they'll give it up until one of them bags the prize. You should think about it.
anderson,"Tell me, why is it that you keep such a low profile about this wonderful place?"
strasser,Our only interest is the well- being of our animals.
anderson," Well, I think I've come to the right place for Morris."
anderson,"You can see how depressed he is. He's grown out of his habitat, and our zoo doesn't have the budget to do anything about it. That's why he needs a new home."
strasser,"Poor thing. Yes, he will be much happier here on our preserve. Back to the wild. Free again."
garth,Phone for you.     Urgent.
strasser,"Will you excuse me, Mr. Anderson?"
strasser,"See what our friends in China will give us for a Bengal tiger, Garth."
garth,Looks like a big fellah.  I'll set a new record with you.
strasser,Strasser.
strasser," What do you want, Pindi?"
pindi,"Not what I want, boss, what you want. How about a giant gorilla?"
strasser,Talk.
pindi,"Big as three men, two thousand pounds, at least."
strasser,"You've been drinking, haven't you?"
pindi,"Swear to God, boss. Saw him with my own two eyes."
strasser,Don't waste my time again.
pindi,Hello?   Boss...
pindi,"I'll catch him and charge you double, madar chode."
poacher,Stupid girl! What do you think you're doing?
jill,I found this in the forest this morning. Thought maybe you dropped it and might want it back.
jill,Poaching is illegal!   Get off this mountain!
kweli, Come here immediately! You are needed at the school this moment!
kweli,We have to talk. Now.
kweli,Your mother slept in this bed. She worked at this desk. She died in this jungle. Do you plan to do everything just like her?
jill,My mother would have been proud of what I did today.
kweli, Proud? Of that foolishness out there? Of you risking your life?
jill,"She risked hers -- why shouldn't I risk mine? I'm just doing what I promised, and I promised to protect Joe. And I'm going to do everything I can to stop the poachers..."
kweli,You can't stop them.  Even she couldn't stop them.
kweli,"Jill, the other gorillas have moved south, to safer lands... but Joe has stayed behind."
jill,They don't want him.   They won't let him come.
kweli,Maybe... or maybe you won't let him go.
jill, He needs me.
kweli,The danger here is building for both of you. I feel it -- and so do you.
kweli,"I know what the American is offering, Jill."
kweli,Think about what he has to say. That's all I ask.
jill,Leaving?
gregg,I'm gonna head up the mountain. See if I can throw some of the poachers off the trail.
jill, You think it will work?
gregg,"Not for long. Just trying to buy you a little time, that's all. With more of these bastards arriving every hour, I suggest you get Joe as deep into the jungle as you can -- as fast as you can."
jill,Okay!
gregg,Okay what?
jill,Okay we'll go.
gregg,We?
jill,"Me and Joe. To that place of yours in California.  What?! You didn't think you could take him without me, did you?"
gregg,You're sure about this?
jill,No. I am completely unsure about this. But I'll do it. On one condition.
gregg,Name it.
jill,I'm in charge of Joe.
gregg,Done.
jill, Done? Just like that?     That was way too easy.
gregg,"You're not a very trusting soul are you, Miss Young?"
jill,"No, I'm not."
gregg," Tough, isn't it? Trying to measure me up -- decide if I'm a fraud..."
jill,... or a fool.
gregg,"Well, I'd like to know if you're a bona fide lunatic or just a mixed up monkey girl but -- but I guess we'll have to take our chances and figure it out as we go along."
gregg,"Come on, Jill. Trust it.      You'll be in charge of Joe.  Let's shake on it."
jill,I don't shake. That's not how we make pacts around here.
gregg," Alright, how do you make pacts around here?"
jill,You have to endure a bite from a Makiki spider.
gregg,A what?
jill,"You'll have a high fever and hallucinations. You'll say things -- lots of things. We'll hear what's in your heart. Then, if your intentions prove true, the pact is made."
gregg,A spider bite and hallucinations?
jill,That's right.
gregg,Then you'll trust me and let me have Joe?
jill,That's right.    Well?
gregg,Well... I think... that's the biggest load of crap I've ever heard.
jill,Good. Maybe you're not a fool after all.
gregg,Get your things together. Fast. We're getting out of here as soon as we can.
gregg, Makiki spider.
jill,I don't know what else to do.
harry,"This is crazy. All I said was, 'Bring back some blood samples.' So what does he bring back? A giant gorilla."
cecily,"Don't even pretend to be upset, Harry."
harry,You know how much it cost to convert the tiger habitat? Try half our operating budget.
cecily,"You'll be on the cover of National Geographic, Harry."
harry,"Hey, I just said it was crazy.    I didn't say it wasn't worth it."
jill,"There are more cars on this road than I've seen in my entire life, total."
gregg,Welcome to L.A.
jill's pov, We see the cab of a large trailer following their car.
jill, Think he's okay back there?   I think he's okay back there.
jill,You think he's okay back there?
gregg, Don't worry. He's doing fine.
jill,Sorry.    I'm a little tense.  Yeah.    I think he's okay back there.
gregg,Good.    Thanks for the update.
jill,So this is L.A.  It all looks the same.   How do you know where you are?
gregg,"Beach is that way, mountains are that way, Mexico's that way, Canada's that way. Don't worry about the rest -- you'll never see it through the smog."
gregg,Maybe you better check and see if Joe's okay back there.
jill, Ha ha.
boy's pov, PUSH IN CLOSE ON the trailer and Joe's two big eyes staring out. They lock eyes momentarily.  The boy isn't sure if he's seeing things. Then two enormous fingers extend out from between the slats and wave at him.
conservancy worker,Main gate to Dr. Banks. They're pulling up now.
cecily,"Elvis is in the building! I repeat, Elvis is in the building..."
cecily,"You hear that, Harry?"
cecily,They smell him.
harry,"Gregg, or the gorilla?"
harry,"I'm confused, O'Hara. You phone us to say you're bringing back a two thousand pound wild animal..."
gregg,"Hello, Harry.     Cecily."
cecily," Welcome back, baby."
harry,"... but security tells me you've requested no firehoses, no restraints of any kind..."
gregg,Let me introduce you to...
harry,"How are we supposed to control the animal? With a giant, rolled-up..."
harry,... newspaper?
gregg,"Jill Young, Dr. Harry Ruben -- he run the place -- and Dr. Cecily Banks, who makes sure he doesn't screw it up."
cecily, Chief veterinarian. Hi.
jill,Hello. It's a privilege to meet you both.
jill,"Coming, Joe! Hold on!  I think he'd like to come out now -- if you don't mind."
harry," Mind?    No, of course I don't mind."
gregg,Harry?   I think it's time you met Joe.
harry,Hold it!
harry,Jack? Vern?    Get the sedatives ready.
jill, We won't need any of that.
harry,"Miss Young, we know what we're doing here, and the best way to..."
gregg,Harry -- you and I made an agreement. The lady's in charge of Joe.
jack,"Easy, big boy."
vern,Don't forget who's gonna feed you.
jill,I'll take it from here.
harry,You sure she knows what she's doing?
gregg,She knows.
jill,"Come on, Joe.     Come on, big guy."
cecily,"That is one, big gorilla."
harry,"Hey! What do I pay you for?    Get some shots -- of me, too."
harry,What -- he did it.
jill,"Come on, ya big baby. Come on back.   Do I have to come in there and get you myself?"
jill, That's it. That-a-boy.
gregg," Go on, Joe. Go on."
harry,Alright.   Take the platform away.
jill,Hold on -- I'm going in with him.
harry,No. We can't allow that. We don't have insurance to cover anyone in there who's not an employee.
gregg,Harry...
jill,But you said -- I'm in charge of Joe.
harry,Yes. And I'm in charge of this facility.
jill, 'I'm in charge of this facility.' Who is that guy? I bet that man hasn't spent one night outside in his entire life.
gregg,Probably not.
jill,"You said I was going to be in charge of Joe. I should be sleeping down there, with him, not in this... this...  cage."
jill,What's wrong with this window? 
gregg, I'll do everything I can for you.
jill, Thank you.
cecily,Where's Gregg?
harry,"Beats me. He collected his pay check. He's probably in some jungle by now, not using deodorant."
cecily,"I think he should be here. This is his discovery, after all."
harry,"Excuse me, Gregg's expertise is pitching tents, not explaining primate behavior to the Chairman of the Conservancy Board."
cecily," Know what I think, Harry?"
harry,I have a feeling I'm gonna find out.
cecily,I think you're jealous.
harry,"Just once I wanted to go into the field and find a new species... mollusk, anything. Instead, he makes the zoological discovery of the century."
cecily,And he still has a full head of hair.
harry,That's not funny.
cecily,Heads up.
harry,Elliot.   Good to see you again.
baker,Harry.    Dr. Banks.
baker,So?   Let's go see him.
cecily,Right this way.
harry,I always had a suspicion that the legend coming out of the Pangani forest might have some truth to it. It was just a hunch -- sort of a gut feeling -- but I sent my field zoologist to check it out.
cecily,"That field zoologist, Dr. O'Hara, had a theory -- and Joe's blood work confirms it. The gorillas in the Pangani carry a recessive gene that pops up every four or five generations with this rare form of gigantism."
baker," And that's where the legend comes from! That zoologist of yours -- what's his name, Harry?"
harry, Gregg O'Hara.
baker,Pretty damn sharp.
harry,Here we are.
baker,Where is he?
harry, I told him the Chairman of the Board was coming and he promised to come say 'hi.'
baker,Well I don't see him.
harry,Mmmm. We'll feed him.    That'll get him to come out.
cecily,"Uh, Harry..."
harry,I know what I'm doing.   Let's open the gate.
gregg,I was coming to get you.
jill,What is that noise?
gregg,Come on!
gregg,What the hell is going on?
cecily,"It's Joe, he's gone crazy!"
joe," who is standing in a clearing, SNARLING and beating his chest. Which is scaring the crap out of..."
harry," who, white as a sheet, hides behind a tree, his hands shaking. He doesn't dare move an inch, for fear Joe will spot him."
gregg,Stop!
jill,Harry!   Jump out from behind the tree!
jill,Jump out and say 'You found me!'
gregg,"Do it, Harry!"
harry,You found me!
jill,He's playing hide and seek.
jill,"Okay, where are you? Come out, big guy! Where'd he go?  There you are!"
baker,"Put that girl in charge of the gorilla, Harry."
harry,"What? Elliot, she's got no scientific..."
baker,That ape is the best fund-raising tool this conservancy has ever seen. He's happy -- I'm happy. Put her on the payroll.
jill,He's playing!    Did you see?
gregg, I saw.
jill,He likes it here! Isn't it great?
gregg,It's great.
cecily,"Sorry, babe, but in a pissing match the monkey kicks your ass."
gregg,What are you talking about?
cecily,"Oh please. I was wondering why you hadn't taken off yet. Normally, you're out the door soon as the animal's in his habitat."
gregg,"You've got an active imagination, Cecily."
cecily,I don't think so. I think Mr. World Traveller has goo-goo eyes for the gorilla girl.
gregg,Like what you've done with the place.
jill,Too bad it's always so cold -- somebody broke my window.
gregg,I just came by to tell you that I think Joe looks real good out there...
jill,I know! This is working out -- better than I expected.
gregg,... and that I'm hitting the road.
jill,Where you going?
gregg,Back to Africa.  For a couple of months.
jill,No kidding?   When do you leave?
gregg,Now.
gregg,"It's the job, y'know. Always on the road. It's what I like, anyway -- can't stand to be caged up..."
gregg,You and Joe will be okay...
jill,Oh -- of course.
gregg,Yeah.   Well...
jill, Say hello to Africa for me.
strasser, My God. Pindi was right.
strasser, He's beautiful. The most beautiful animal I have ever seen.
garth,"And the most valuable, that's for sure."
strasser,I want him.   He belongs here with me.
garth," It'll be a bit tricky, won't it? They're not gonna want to part with..."
strasser,Wait!   Be quiet!
on tv," Intercut with shots of Joe are shots of the conservancy staff. Jill is among them, and her look of displeasure with the photographing of Joe makes her stand out from the staff. This shot is replaced with side by side photographs of Jill and her mother, Ruth.  REPORTER  Both Joe and Jill's mothers were killed by poachers, twelve years ago, in the Pangani Forest, orphaning them on the same night."
garth, Bloody hell. That's the little monster that...
strasser," I am always amazed how, if you wait long enough, the opportunity for justice finally comes."
strasser,Book us two tickets to America. We're going to pay a visit to this incredible animal.
strasser,I think I know how to convince his current owners to part with him.
harry,"This fellow is one of only three hundred wild yaks remaining on the planet. There are those who would ask, why should we care if this sub-species of yak survives?"
harry, You certainly can -- for the mere price of a 'Diamond Circle Benefactor Ticket' to tomorrow night's benefit.
harry,It's all for a good cause.
harry,Good-bye. Good-bye.  Throw money... throw money...
jill,Harry -- see what's in that cart? That's all we have left of the lobelia leaves for Joe. Did you by any chance place that new order I asked for?
harry," Of course I... actually, perhaps I..."
jill," I wouldn't be surprised if you forgot, considering you have so much on your mind."
harry,I'll go rush order it for you now.
jill, Thank you so much.
cecily," She's nice. I'm not. If you forget to order something I need, I'll knock you upside the head."
harry,I keep telling you -- stop talking to me like that.
cecily,Please.   You love it.
gregg,Lobelia leaves. Should have called me in Africa. I would have brought 'em back for ya.
gregg,"Nice to see you running the place, Jill."
jill,You're back early. What happened? Run out of humvees to crash?
gregg,No -- just wanted to get back.
jill, Really? And why is that?
gregg,Guess I missed Harry.
gregg,They want me to show my face at the fundraiser tomorrow night... and I guess I got my mind fixed on a good meal in a fine restaurant. Thought you might like to join me.
jill, No thanks. I still don't want to leave Joe.
gregg,'Still'? Haven't you been out of here yet?
jill," What's to see? Beach is that way, mountains are that way, Mexico's that way, Canada's that way..."
gregg,"Come on. Have dinner with me, Jill.  You won't find a better excuse to brush your hair."
jill,I'll brush my hair if you take a shower.
gregg, Deal.
garth,"You remember, don't you?"
jill,So this is what you call a good meal in a fine restaurant?
gregg, Yeah.
jill,Don't point that smile at me. I'm still mad at you for taking off and leaving me here all alone.
gregg, I'm sorry -- I had things I had to do...
jill, Uh-huh...
gregg,"Besides, you weren't all alone. You had Joe."
jill, That's right. Me and Joe.   Just like always.
gregg,Growing up with him around -- what's it been like for you? I mean -- most guys are afraid of girls' fathers. I can just see a guy telling Joe he'll get you home by midnight...
jill, Never had anyone to bring home anyway. All that stuff -- I don't even know what it's like.
gregg,All what 'stuff'?
jill, Whatever you want to call it. Being in love.
jill,Oh yeah?   How's that?
gregg, You'll get a kind of a fever...
jill,Fever?   Really. How high?
gregg,Pretty high.
jill,Interesting.   Hallucinations with that?
gregg,"Oh yeah... and you'll, uh -- find yourself saying things. Lots of things."
jill,Aaah!
jill,Come on!
vern,He's ripping out saplings like bam-bam-bam!
jack,And taking out irrigation pipes. One good yank -- on comes the flood.
harry,He just pulled out another acacia tree. You know what I paid for those?
gregg, Do you know what's wrong with him?
cecily, Do you?
jill,No.
harry,Well could you get in there and calm him down before he pulls out the rest of my landscaping?
baker, Impossible.
jill," Please, Mr. Baker -- I   wouldn't be asking you to postpone   the benefit unless I thought there   was something really wrong   with Joe. And I do."
baker,"From what I heard, you sang him to sleep last night like a baby. What's really wrong about that?"
jill,"I swear to you, Joe's still not himself -- he's nervous and agitated. He shouldn't be exposed to a crowd of strangers right now. If you would only delay the party a few more..."
baker,"It's too late, Jill."
jill, No.   It's too soon.
baker,"Miss Young, let me give you some advice. Stop worrying about Joe, and start worrying about what you'll wear tomorrow night."
jill,Oh!   Excuse me.
strasser,"No, excuse me.     My fault."
strasser, I'm so sorry -- it's just -- you must be Jill Young...
jill,Yes...?
strasser, And -- you look just like her.
strasser,I'm Andre Strasser. An old friend of your mother's. 
jill,How wonderful to meet you.   What are you doing here?
strasser,I've come to talk with your Mr. Baker.  I believe she would agree with me -- a magnificent wild animal like Joe needs more space -- like the Raha Preserve I run in Botswana.
jill,Raha?   A preserve?
strasser,"I have twenty thousand acres there where the animals are free to run. I would like to offer them to Joe.  Here, it's such a shame... to see Joe living in a man-made habitat and being used as an attraction to raise money..."
strasser,Oh -- I've upset you! Please... I only mean to offer an alternative. I will be attending the event tomorrow night. Maybe we can talk more about this matter then.
jill,I'll look forward to it.
strasser,Good-bye.
cecily,Don't you clean up nice.
gregg,Cecily -- you're ravishing. Harry -- you got shrimp on your shirt.
harry, Of course. I look ridiculous.
cecily,No.  You look fine.  They look ridiculous.
harry,Hel-lo.   Look what we have here.
cecily, I picked out the dress.   Aren't I smart?
gregg,Brilliant.
cecily,"Shut your mouth, Harry -- you're catching flies."
jill, Tell me the truth -- do I look stupid in this? Everyone is staring at me.
gregg, They're staring at that... uh... banana tower.
jill,Very funny.
garth,Quite a turnout they have here.
strasser,All the better.
strasser,Let's go.
baker,"When was the last time you laid eyes on something so unique, so spectacular, that it literally took your breath away? Well, prepare yourselves, for tonight you will have such an experience."
jack," There's nothing in this punch, man. I could drink twelve of these and not feel a thing."
vern,Sorry!   Here's your... uh... key chain.
strasser,Thank you.
joe's pov," Garth stands at the railing surrounding the moat, rattling the dog collars. It's a sound that haunts him, from the darkest depths of his memory. He starts to GROWL and then he sees something that really drives him nuts.  Strasser steps into the light, joining Garth by the water's edge. He rattles the dog collar, and now..."
strasser, Have you forgotten this?
garth,What do you think the big guy is worth? A couple million?
strasser,"I will get that for the paws alone. After we sell him off piece by piece, who knows how much we'll make?"
garth,Got you going now! That should rattle the jewelry off the ladies.
strasser, And come back for it -- after.
strasser,"Come, we've done our job here."
baker,"... and now to introduce our remarkable new acquisition, I would like to bring up to the podium the director of the conservancy..."
baker,Well! I suppose there's no need to add to that introduction.
baker,Here's Dr. Harry Ruben.
harry," In the time it took you to drive here tonight, three species have disappeared from the Earth. Extinct. Never to return. We here at the conservancy say this is a tragedy..."
harry, Obviously Joe agrees.
harry,"But tonight, rather than focusing on what we've lost, I'm going to introduce you to something we've found."
harry,"Ladies and gentlemen, the California Animal Conservancy proudly introduces our newest member, Mighty Joe..."
jill," Hey, Joe. I'm right here. You hear me? Good boy. Take it easy, Joe. We don't want to scare anybody, do we?"
joe," heads through the people towards Strasser.        The party erupts with screams.  Joe makes his way towards Strasser, swatting people out of the way."
on strasser," Frozen, in horror, as Joe plows through the party, heading straight for him. Tables are broken like match sticks, GLASS SHATTERS.  Joe catches up to Strasser, grabs his tuxedo jacket and hoists him into the air."
jill,My God.   What's wrong with him?
gregg,We've got to bring him down.   I'm going for the tranq guns.
jill,No -- let me stop him.
terry, Faster! Faster!
ray,I'm trying!
jill," is pushing against the tide of people to get to Joe. Somebody shoves against her hard: it's Baker, in a panic to get away."
joe," continues to make his way towards Strasser.   As he rushes towards him...  A security guard runs into the tent, raising his TRANQ gun and FIRES...  The dart misses, hitting a fleeing guest, who, we see as he crumples to the ground, is actually Baker."
strasser, is fleeing for the exit.
baker,Joe has been transferred to a special steel reinforced concrete bunker.
baker,"That won't be happening anytime soon. In the meantime, we will do anything necessary to ensure the safety of the public."
jill,"Joe... look at me. Over here, big guy."
jill, I knew something was wrong with him.
gregg,What do you think happened out there?
jill, Joe never would have hurt all those people unprovoked... something must have got to him.
gregg,Something.   Or someone.
harry,Can I talk to you for a second?
gregg," Well this wasn't in the brochure, was it?"
gregg,"I promised you wouldn't be put in a cage. I'm sorry, Joe. I helped put you here. And now I'm going to do everything I can to get you out."
harry,"The City Attorney talked to Baker. It wasn't my decision, and there's nothing I can do about it."
jill,About what?
harry,Joe stays in there until they decide what to do with him.
jill," In there? Harry, look at him. He's depressed, he won't eat. If he stays in there, he'll die within days."
harry,So sue me.    Everybody else is.
jill,"Listen, Harry, either you tell them you're getting Joe out of there or I will!"
harry,"Don't you get it? This is way beyond you, and me. Joe freaked out on some very influential people. He's a public relations nightmare. No zoo will take a two-thousand-pound killer gorilla..."
jill, He's not a killer!
harry,"... and unless you can write a check for millions of dollars to buy him a big back yard somewhere, Joe's got nowhere to go."
jill,That's it?    You're not going to do anything?
jill,I need your help.
gregg,You got it.
cecily, Good evening.
gregg, We're conservancy doctors. Do me a favor -- stay here and guard the door.
jill,"Come on, Joe. We're leaving. Let's get you out of here."
cecily,"I'm Dr. Banks, the head vet. And I'm taking Joe for a CAT Scan."
gregg," Officer, you don't want to point that gun at him, believe me."
jill, He didn't believe you.
cecily,Bring him out.
strasser,"Jill, I got the plane. It's waiting at the airport. We must hurry."
cecily,"I'm going to miss your ugly face. Be good, Joe."
harry,You'd better leave out of the west gate. The guard there got called away. Urgent business.
jill,You're not such a big coward after all.
harry," Okay, okay, let go."
cecily,Write me when Joe gets settled.
jill,I promise.
jill," You coming to the airport, or...?"
gregg, I think I better stay here and keep people away from that bunker. Give you a head start before they realize he's gone.
jill," Well -- if you're ever in Botswana, come by and take me out to a good meal in a fine restaurant. That is, if you're not afraid to tell Joe that you'll get me home by..."
gregg," Take care of her for me, will ya?"
strasser,Jill!   We must go!
garth,Hello.
strasser,"Don't worry, Jill. Soon Joe will be back home again."
cecily, How many minutes do you give it before the whole world knows he's missing?
gregg,Five. How many minutes do you give it before we're both lookin' through the want ads?
cecily,Six.
gregg,What're you guys doing here so late?
jack,Baker wants the tent cleaned up A.S.A.P.
vern,"Check out the loot we plundered in the wake of mass party panic! This is some weird lost and found, man."
jack,"Yeah, and we've got the fun job of getting this stuff back to everybody.  Somebody's head is cold!"
gregg, Where did you find this?
vern,Oh -- that was by the habitat.  Guess we've got to find those two guys again.
gregg, What two guys?
jack,"That, uh...  What do you think that one guy is? Russian? Lithuanian?"
cecily, Be careful!
jill,Please!   Be careful...
strasser,"Always worrying, eh? Your mother was a worrier, too. Always worrying about the gorillas. It made her a lot of enemies. It led to tragedy."
jill,My mother was brave.
strasser,"So are you, my dear."
strasser,"It's not so pretty, I know."
jill, What happened?
strasser,Well... you could say I had an encounter with a monster.  Monstrule.
jill,Murdering bastard!
jill,Joe!   Get out!
strasser, Drive!
jill, Do you know who they are?
gregg,I know.
gregg,Come on.   Let's go get him back.
strasser,Wait.
garth,Police'll be here any minute.
garth,We better go.
garth,Come on!   We need to get out of here!
tourist,Hey! It's that gorilla that was on TV!
joe's pov, It is indeed an urban jungle -- made up of neon and steel.
angle, Joe walks down the street and bumps into:
parked mercedes, Whose ALARM GOES OFF immediately.   Joe wheels and smashes the car until the sound STOPS.
ray,"Whoa... Hey, Joe!"
cop,Up there!
gregg,He couldn't have gotten far.
jill, Joe!   Joe!
excited neighbors,This way!
closer, beat -- then Joe steps through.     He's at the apex of the urban mountain range.
jill, No! He's not dangerous! You're dangerous! You're dangerous!
gregg, She didn't mean that.
jill, Yes I did.
gregg,"Better cool it, baby."
jill,They're going to shoot him.
gregg,Not if we find him first.
gregg,Let's follow them.
garth,"What are you doing? You don't think we can get the gorilla now, do you?"
strasser,We need a car.     Now.
rubbernecker,Fifth goddamn time this year.
rubbernecker,Hey! I was going! No need to be so pushy about it.
gregg,Any idea where he might've headed?
jill,Look.
jill,That's where he'll go. He'll think that's me calling him.
young couple, stops to share the view -- and a kiss.   Until a LOUD GROWL makes them jump back.  Joe has appeared under the arch. The young girl screams -- her boyfriend pulls her back.
jason,"Mom, I don't think I can let you go on the ferris wheel."
jason's mother,Why not?
jason,"Because the last time after you ate two hot dogs, you threw up, remember?"
jason's mother,What if I promised to throw up over the side?
jason,"Mom, I think I should do this ride by myself."
jason's mother, Okay... I'll watch you.
by light," Joe arrives at his destination -- the bright light that drew him here. He's confused by the fact that Jill's nowhere to be found. Desperately, he scans the park...  People scream and panic around Joe. The noise drives him deeper into the park, searching for Jill. Meanwhile --                                                  118  AT ARCADE - BIG SAFARI BOOTH  Three college guys shoot replica AIR GUNS at cardboard lions and elephants, setting off fake explosions in a ""Big Safari"" booth."
joe, feels threatened and recoils. Then he continues past them. The rush of people away from him gets more frenzied.
jill,He's gotta be here.   Do you see him?
garth," Hold on, now -- just who are you aiming at?"
garth,No.   You can't do that.
strasser,"If that girl starts telling people who we really are, our whole cover operation will be blown."
garth,She's not an animal. That's a human being you're about to kill.
strasser,Go wait in the car.
jenny's mother,Oh God...
strasser,"That was very stupid, Garth."
garth,"You're not a hunter, you're a murderer, and I won't be a part of this..."
strasser,Anything else on your mind?
jill,What was that?
gregg,"Go find Joe, get him out of here.  I'm gonna see if I can help."
jill, heads over to the carnival games.  CUT TO:
jenny,Mo-om!!
jenny's mother,Oh my God!   Somebody help!
gregg,Don't be scared. Climb down my back.
gregg,Come on.
jenny's mother,"Thank you!   Oh God, thank you!"
jill,Joe!   Joe!!
commander gorman,Get the marksmen up here! Now!
jill,"Come on, Joe.    Come on."
jill, Joe got Strasser. He was trying to kill me.
gregg,I know.   I just hope they do.
jill,Joe?
jill,Joe!
sharpshooter, Talk about an easy target.
gregg,Don't shoot him.
commander gorman, Ready...
jill,"Stop! He's not dangerous, please..."
commander gorman, Get them out of here! Now!
jason's mother,"Officer, help! I can't find my son! I think he's still on the Ferris wheel."
jill,Look!
sharpshooter, follows Joe's ascent through his viewfinder.
jason's mother, Oh my God! Jason!
jill,He'll save your boy.
jason's mother,Don't shoot.  Let him try.
gorman,Hold your fire.
on ground," All eyes watch, in awe, as Joe presses Jason to his massive chest.  ON JILL -- smiling through tears.    Gregg puts an arm around her."
behind them, Camera crews from local TV news stations have poured into the park. They film all of this.
jason's mother,"Oh, please, no..."
gregg,It's going to tip! Everyone back up!
on joe, As he cradles Jason tight in his arms.  The wheel begins to fall towards the ground.   116.  128   CONTINUED:                                                      128  Joe jumps away from the burning wheel --
pov shot, As the ground comes rushing up at him.
joe," hits hard, just clearing the falling wheel by inches.    He doesn't move.  PAN the crowd -- an eerie silence falls over everyone. The only sound the CRACKLING of the FIRE."
jill, breaks free from Gregg and runs toward Joe.   Jason's Mother races with her.
jason,Mom?
jill," She kneels by Joe stroking his great chest. Joe doesn't respond. Jill bows her head and cries deeply.  People back away to give her room. How strange to see this huge, powerful animal stilled."
jason's mother,I'm so sorry...
jill," That's right, Joe -- that's right, big guy. That was a big fall but you're okay, aren't you? You're tough. You're so tough. Yes you are. Yes you are."
gregg, And get him somewhere safe.
jill, Somewhere safe? Where is that?
jason's mother," Perhaps... I mean, maybe... isn't there anything we can do?"
jill, No. I don't think so. Not unless you have a few million dollars on you to buy him a home somewhere.
jason,Here.   For Joe.
gregg,Thanks.
gorman,For Joe.
cops,Here.   For Joe.
cut to:,A118A.
pindi,"For Mighty Joe, bro."
dissolve to:,118A.
gregg,"Hey, Joe -- come on, big guy..."
aerial shot," TRACKING WITH Joe, who begins to run now, limbs out- stretched with energy and joy, claiming his freedom.  The CAMERA RISES OFF of Joe to the verdant African landscape beyond. Joe's home -- protected and free.  FADE OUT."
