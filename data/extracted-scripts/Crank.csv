mirror chev,"Bipolar. Sadomasochistic tendencies. Adrenaline junkie. Addicted to violence... probably spends every day of his life looking for the big thrill, the big rush. Cutting up a guy like that while he screams in his own blood and excrement would be like... like a GIFT... a warrior's death... hell, you'd probably get off on it..."
hev,Did you rehearse this?
mirror chev,"No, this was the best way for a guy like you: a slow, ticking clock... winding down... inevitable... non-negotiable... until..."

chev, We'll see what kind of a bitch you are when Carlito hires you for half what he used to pay me... and you take it.
carlito,That's enough.
chev,You'll probably throw boss a nice little reach-around just to show what a good bitch you are.
verona,"I'm nobody's little bitch, you hear me? He'll pay what I tell him to pay...!"
carlito,"I said that's enough.  It's been a long day. But in the end, you must agree, it all works out quite nicely. Don Kim gets his bullet, thanks to you..."
