Speaker,Dialogue
lynch,I don't see her.
dan,The shift change is late.   Just wait.
parker,Are you sure about this?
dan,We've been doing this forever. Trust me. This lady loves Lynch. She always goes for it.
lynch,I'm cute.
parker,Is um... is that her?
dan,Shit.
lynch,Dude.
dan,"It's cool, it's cool.  Look, all you have to do is smile real pretty and tell him-"
parker,-What?   Me? No way.    This is your thing.
lynch,"-GIRLfriends. Say ""girlfriends""."
dan,-you and your girlfriends forgot your credit card and you can't pick up your lift tickets.
parker,"Dan, no.   You do it.    I feel stupid."
dan,You've got this.    You can totally do this.
lynch,"Parker, you've so got this."
dan,The worst thing that happens is he says no. He won't say no. No one ever says no.
parker,Why me?
lynch,`Cause you're a girl.
dan,A very beautiful girl with a very charming smile. 
parker,My charming smile?
parker,Hey.  Jason looks up at her.  PARKER  Could I bum a smoke?
jason,Jason.
parker,"Oh, cool.    My brother's name is Jason."
jason,OK.
parker,"Yeah, so I don't want to waste your time and bullshit you cause you seem like a wicked busy guy and everything...but..this is gonna sound so stupid..."
jason,Right.
parker,"No- but I mean, we totally have some cash and stuff. We just don't have enough to cover all 3 lift tickets, you know?"
jason,How much?
parker,Like...fifty?
jason,I could lose my job.
lynch,He's not going for it.
dan,"Will you shut up? He's gonna go for it. It's either stand there and do the job for minimal... minimal, what is it?"
lynch,Minimum.
dan,-Minimum wage or do it for minimum wage plus a little bit more.
lynch,She had to come skiing with us?
dan,You said you didn't mind?
lynch,I don't.   I don't mind.   Don't mind at all.
x,"A beat.  LYNCH  I'm just saying, you haven't done dollar pitchers at Fezziwigs with"
r,"us since last semester. You never come around for Monday night football, nobody has seen you at-"
lynch,"For ten minutes, Dan. Football games are more than ten minutes."
dan,"Dude, I have a girlfriend now. I love this girl. I don't know what you..."
lynch,It's not a problem. It's not. Forget I ever said anything.
x,DAN Good work!     See?   They always go for it.
r,"PARKER I did good, right?"
lynch,You did great.
a,"DAN Oh, so where's my change?"
parker,There isn't any.
lynch,I would have asked for change.
parker,"It's still way cheaper than paying for tickets, right?"
lynch,I would have definitely asked him for change.
jason," ""Girlfriends""?"
x,Parker gives him an apologetic smile.  The three get in front of the chair. It descends under them and scoops them off of the ground into the air.
r,7   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - MOMENTS LATER                                 7 The threesome float high above the mountain as the chair slowly makes it's way to the top.
a,"DAN Look at that. See? All these other idiots are paying top dollar to ski. Not us. All thanks to you, baby."
dan,I'm just not a `pet name' guy.
parker,"Yeah but you're supposed to call me something affectionate, you know? Like ""honey"" or ""sweetie""."
lynch,"I hooked up with a girl last semester that called me by my last name in bed. It was so weird. ""Oh, Lynch! Your hair is so soft! Do me harder, Lynch!"" It was like I was throwing it to Dan over here."
dan,"See? At least I don't call you ""O'Neil""."
parker,You don't touch my face enough either.
x,Dan laughs.
r,Third wheel.
lynch,"Hey, that's not fair. I'm not dating you, you don't get to make my life suck."
dan,Wha-? I never said that. I never said you make my life suck.  Sweetie.
lynch, Dan tells me you're getting the hang of that board?
parker,"I wouldn't say that. But last time we went I did pretty good, right?"
dan,"You did awesome. I'm telling you, the first few times are frustrating but once you get the hang of it, it's like riding a bike.  Are you gonna trade in those ancient things for a board?"
lynch,Please. Snowboards are too EMO for me. Give it ten more years and that fad will be dead.
x,DAN That's what they said about rap.  Parker removes a cigarette and lights it.
r,"LYNCH Mmm-mmm. Smell that fresh mountain air, huh? Kind of smells like... cancer."
dan,"No, I have never- why would I ever sniff my floss? Why am I friends with you?"
parker,What time do you think we'll get back? I have about 2 weeks worth of chapters to read tonight.
lynch,Oh no. She broke the rule.
x, Parker you just broke the first rule.
r,What?
dan,No worrying about the bullshit of real life. The whole point of this
parker,"But, I haven't read a-"
lynch,Uh-oh! Is someone afraid of heights?
parker,No.
lynch,So it doesn't bother you when I do this?
parker,Quit it!  Dan motions to Lynch to stop.  PARKER  I'm not afraid of heights.   I just
x,don't like them.
dan,"Baby, in the whole history of time, only one chair has ever fallen off"
r,of a lift.
parker,"Points for calling me ""baby"" but you just made that statistic up."
lynch,"OK, WHAT ASSHOLE COULDN'T GET ON THE CHAIR RIGHT?"
dan,"Actually, I paid good money."
lynch,"Yeah, but I'm gonna pay you back so it's like the same thing."
x,He playfully sticks his tongue out at her and she laughs as their chair moves forward exiting frame.
r,The three begin to get situated with their boards and skis.
parker,Why do I have to wear a helmet?
a,DAN Safety first.
parker,But you guys don't wear them.
parker,You're just doing this to make fun of me.
dan,"No, I'm not. I swear.    You look hot in a helmet.  Off to the side, Lynch spots SHANNON  struggling with her boot strap. She falls down on her ass."
x,Lynch nonchalantly maneuvers over to her side.
lynch,Need some help?
r,SHANNON  Do you think?  Lynch puts out a hand to help her and pulls her up almost
parker,"Aww, check out Lynch."
lynch,"Woah! Shit, man!    I was just trying to help!"
shannon,"Ryan, what the hell?"
ryan,He had his hands all over you!
shannon,"No he didn't. I can take care of myself!  She shoves him back. Ryan just shakes his head at her and shoves off, away from the group. He waits for her down the hill a few feet."
x,Dan and Shannon help Lynch to his feet.  SHANNON  I am so sorry about that. He can
r,be such an asshole sometimes.
lynch,"I was seriously just trying to help. I mean, how could I even"
lynch,"Yeah, I'm fine."
shannon,"Well, thank you for your help.    I am so, so sorry about that."
lynch,Joe.
shannon,Well it was nice to meet you.
lynch, I was like one second away from beating that guy's ass.
dan,"I know you were, man.   Come on. Don't sweat it."
lynch,"Seriously, that guy was such a dick."
x,PARKER Come on boys. We can talk about how tough you both are at the bottom.
r,Lynch starts down the hill.
dan,I'm tough.
a,PARKER I know you are.  They push off out of frame.
parker,"Are you kidding? We are totally doing this every weekend. In fact, if they were open during the week I'd say we should cut class, too."
lynch,Last one to the bottom is buying dinner!
x,Dan and Lynch pick at what's left of a pizza on the table in front of them.
dan,We gotta take a weekend trip up
r,North one of these days. Hit up Killington or Okemo and really do it up right.
a,Why don't we just do it over Christmas. You and me.
dan,Done. When I stayed with my cousin out West two years ago it was like
lynch,"Well, speaking of good skiing... it's been cool doing the bunny hill"
lynch,"No, it's fine. I'm just saying let's step it up a notch at some point. It's been cool watching Parker fall on her ass all day but I would like to actually ski at some point."
parker,"You know, I've probably had enough for today anyway. I can just stay in the lodge if you guys want to go-"
x,Now Lynch feels horrible.
lynch,"-no, no, no that's not what I meant. I didn't mean it like that."
r,Parker looks to Dan.
parker,I told you I didn't have to come.
lynch,"Exactly. Remember? I was like ""Hey man, why doesn't Parker come"
dan,"-I was like, ""OK that would be cool""."
parker,"It's OK, you guys. The last thing a girl wants to do is intrude on ""guy time"". I won't be offended. I've got stuff I could do anyway.  Actually, can I have the key? I should check my messages."
dan,No. No locker key. I can tell you right now that every message on there is going to be from your Mom giving you more aggravation about whatever the hell.
x,Parker laughs.
parker,She does not.
r,Dan looks to Lynch.
dan,Ready for this? Two nights ago we were watching a movie and her Mom
parker,I'm sorry if I ruined skiing for you today.
lynch,"You didn't! You didn't at all! You missed the part before you walked over here when I was all like, ""Dude, this has been so cool...you know...doing..."""
x,Parker and Dan are beaming at him.   He knows he's beat.  LYNCH  What?
r,"11   EXT. FRONT OF LODGE - MOMENTS LATER, NIGHT                   11 Parker, Dan, and Lynch come out of the lodge."
a,From their POV the chair lift is still moving but the line is empty.  They start to move to the empty lift line when...
lynch, Wait up.
shannon,Hey. I just wanted to apologize again.
shannon,"Ex. He's my ex-boyfriend. We're, you know, trying to still be friends and everything but as you can see, that's not really gonna work."
lynch, No way.
shannon,"A group of us all agreed to go skiing this weekend and well, whatever. It's a whole story and-  She looks over at Dan and Parker."
x,SHANNON 
r,Are you gonna be here next weekend?
lynch,"Where, here? Yeah, probably, yes."
shannon,OK.   See ya later.
lynch,"Actually, you know what? Would it be cool if I got your number or"
shannon,"Yeah, sure."
lynch,Shit. Don't ski with my phone. It's in the locker with everyone else's stuff. Do you have a pen?
shannon,Don't ski with a pen.     Sorry.
lynch,Just shoot then. I've got a really good memory. I've only smoked pot like 500 times so I'm good.  Shannon gets serious.
x,SHANNON You know it's a gateway drug right?  Joe is nervous.
r,SHANNON  Kidding.
lynch,Whew.   You! That's so like you!
a,12   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - MOMENTS LATER                         12 Dan and Parker are in a heated debate with Jason the chair lift operator.
dan,But we gave you a hundred bucks and we've only gotten like 4 runs!
jason,Why don't you write a letter?
lynch," Remember ""429""."
dan,What?
lynch,"Just remember ""429"". "
x,"Come on, just one more run."
jason,Sorry.
r,"DAN Honestly, I'd slide you some more money but we gave you everything we have."
a,"LYNCH  Hey man, do you have a pen?  Jason ignores him."
parker,What if we promise to run straight
dan,Wicked fast.
jason,Fine. But hurry. DAN                              PARKER Thank you!                           Thank you so much!
dan,We'll be wicked fast.    Like the wind!  Jason sends them up the lift.    He checks to make sure no one is watching.
lynch,Seriously. For a hundred bucks
x,you'd think he could cut us some slack.
dan,I know right? They're supposed to
r,stay open until 10 on Sundays. Whatever happened to night skiing?
lynch,Wachusett still has night skiing.
a,"We should have gone there. It's kinda like Ward Hill but not as lame.  Hey, you remember the numbers I told you?"
parker,"Good for you, Lynch.   You got her number!"
parker,Nope.
rifkin,"Early night, huh?"
jason,You're not gonna hear me complain.
x,RIFKIN Pendergraft wants you to stop by the office.   Something about next weekend's schedule.
r,"JASON I'm not working next weekend.  Rifkin gives him a look.   ""That's what you thought."""
a,"JASON  Oh, come on. It's my brother's bachelor party. I put in for it two months ago."
jason,I'm the best man!  Shit.
rifkin,Ready to shut down?
jason,"There's three more on their way down. Wait for them, then it's all set."
parker,I'm not waiting til we get back to campus to eat. I'm starving.
dan,Why didn't you have some pizza?
parker,"You mean the cardboard with tomato sauce that you guys ate? That wasn't pizza. That was like,"
x,`roller skating rink birthday party pizza'.
lynch,There's a Papa Gino's on our way
r,back. It's like 15 minutes down the road from the mountain.
parker,Sweet. I am gonna eat a whole real
dan,Check it out!
dan,"It's just wind, Parker."
lynch,"Don't you mean, ""baby""?"
dan, Who invited you?
x,HEYMAN  runs by him on his way to the lodge.
r,"Heyman!    HEY, HEYMAN!   Do me a solid?  Heyman looks back him.   His face already says ""no."""
a,RIFKIN  I've gotta piss so bad I can taste it. Can you just take over for 2 minutes?  Heyman points to his ears as if he can't hear what Rifkin is
parker,Shit.   Do you hear that?
parker,Seriously. I'm gonna eat a whole pizza.  I'm not even kidding.
x,"Nothing.  He sighs.  Just then, the three skiers that we saw taking the jump a few"
r,minutes earlier come flying down the mountain and past him.  A voice from the top lift cuts through the radio.  VOICE 
a,Last chair is through.
rifkin,Cool. Last three just hit.   I'm
dan,"Oh, come on."
parker,Bur!
lynch, IT'S FRIGGIN COLD UP HERE!   NO TIME FOR THIS CRAP! THANK YOU!  They sit and wait in silence for a few seconds.
x,"PARKER It's gonna start again, right?"
r,Yes.  Anyone got any jokes?
a,What did the fourteen year old girl from New Hampshire say to her father when she lost her virginity?
dan,"""Get off me, you're crushing my"
lynch,I told you that?
dan,What do you think the worst way to die would be?
parker,That's not morbid.
lynch,"Yeah, seriously.    That's kinda spooky, Dan."
x,DAN I think getting eaten by a shark would be the worst way to go.  Not if it was like one of those
lynch,The chick on the Jaws poster was
parker,She was?
lynch,I don't know. She was naked. Naked chicks are hot.
lynch,That's why I only swim in pools.
parker,I think burning to death would be the worst.
lynch,Well yes and no. Because most people die of the smoke inhalation before any fire even hits them.
parker,I remember watching TV for like 3
x,days straight after 9/11. That footage that they kept showing of all of those people leaping off of the top of the Trade Center? Can you imagine how bad it was inside
r,to know that jumping was a better way out?
lynch,But they say that when you jump
parker,"OK, then Lynch. What is the worst"
lynch, What?
parker,"No, you have an answer for"
parker,The what?
lynch,"The Sarlaac pit. From Return of the Jedi? Hel-lo...being slowly digested over 1,000 years? Worst. Death. Ever."
dan," ""I don't know why I never have a girlfriend, you guys!"""
lynch,Shut-up.
x,Why hasn't it started again?
dan,Give it a minute.
r,"LYNCH This is nothing man. At Stowe last year, me and Solet were stranded for like 25 minutes. This big chick fell getting off up top and"
a,"twisted her leg. It was like- ""move her to the side and keep the line going people"". But no. They had to stop and celebrate it right there and we all had to-"
dan, WHAT THE FUCK??!    HELLO???!!!!
lynch,Come on now! This is messed up.
parker,HEY! TURN THE LIGHTS BACK ON! HELLO!!!!
dan,Are they fucking kidding?
lynch,"I kind of just shat in my pants a bit, I'm not gonna lie."
x,DAN HE-LLO!!!!!!!!!!!????  Parker is starting to shake.
r,PARKER  No one knows we're up here.    They forgot that we're up here.
parker,What if they don't start it again?
dan, Will you stop?!
lynch,What did you say to the guy?
dan,Me?   Nothing!
lynch,"Well, clearly you pissed him off enough to do this."
dan,I didn't do anything!   He knows we're still up here.
parker,"Then why are the lights off, Dan? Is that part of their policy? Shut"
x,off the lights and scare the customers?
dan,They just lost power or something.
r,I'm sure it's gonna come back on any second.  They didn't go home. That's retarded.
lynch,This is so messed up.
parker,Don't yell at me.
dan,I wasn't yelling at you but you need to relax. This stuff happens all the time. Can you imagine the law suit if they left everyone on this lift up here all night?
lynch,Free lift tickets.
parker,What other people on the lift? There was no one in front of us.
x,She made a good point.   But still...
dan,We won't be stuck here all night.
r,PARKER No. You're right. We won't be here all night. It's Sunday.  Its fucking Sunday and they aren't
lynch,"We're not going to be stuck here. Parker. Parker, look at me. Even"
parker, -HELP!!! SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP US!!!! HEL-LO!!! HELP!!!!!
dan,"Shh. I know you're scared. I'm scared, too. But any minute now they're gonna turn the power back on and we're all gonna be laughing about this."
x,More moments pass in silence as they survey their situation.
r,I have to pee.  They all share an uncomfortable laugh.  PARKER 
a,I have to pee wicked bad.
lynch,That makes two of us.
lynch,"Well, what do you want me to do?   I gotta go."
parker,Are you crazy! Put the bar down!!!
lynch,It's just the safety bar. It doesn't really do anything anyway.
parker,Well I like the safety bar and I like it down where it's supposed to be.
dan,Then how are you going to piss?
parker,I can hold it.
x,For a whole week?  Dan and Parker glare at him.  LYNCH 
r,"Sorry.  She's the one who said we'd be here for ""a week""!"
parker,I can hold it.
lynch,I'm pissing.
dan,I hope they catch you and throw you out. I hope they ban you from the
lynch,Ban me from the mountain? You couldn't pay me to come back here. Make me sit up here in below zero weather forever while they get their damn Fisher Price lift working? Sorry. Not coming back.
x,"Almost instantly, giant balls of hail stream down at them. ""Ping-ing"" off of the metal chair and pelting their faces.  The wind blows hard as their flimsy chair swings back and forth in the foul weather."
r,Parker sobs quietly into Dan's shoulder.
lynch,SOMEBODY GET US DOWN FROM HERE!
a,HELP!
dan," Put the safety bar down, Joe."
dan, Put the bar down.
dan,PUT THE BAR DOWN!
x,24   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - MOMENTS LATER                              24 The three stranded kids huddle together for warmth as the hail pours down around them in sheets.
r,"Suddenly, a beam of light begins to shine up at them.  Dan's head snaps up."
a,CUT TO:
dan,"What did I tell you guys, huh?   WOO- HOO! UP HERE!"
parker,UP HERE!
x,DAN HELLO!  CUT TO:
r,29   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                            29 The Snow Cat continues on right underneath them.   It doesn't
a,look like it's going to stop.  CUT TO:
parker,Why isn't he stopping?
lynch,HEY!   WHAT THE HELL?!!
steve,Go for Steve.
x,"Below them, the Snow Cat slows down to a halt.  The three kids cheer."
r,DAN / PARKER / LYNCH THANK YOU! / WOO! / YES!!  CUT TO:
a,33   INT. SNOW CAT - CONTINUOUS                                  33 Steve listens.  VOICE 
steve,That's gonna take me 20 minutes!
lynch,What is this asshole doing?
parker,"No!   No!  Quickly Dan and Lynch start to ball together the slush on the sides of the chair.  They throw them at the Snow Cat, but keep missing by a few"
x,"inches.  Desperately, Lynch throws his goggles at the Snow Cat.  They land just shy of the driver's side window."
r,Parker takes off her helmet and throws it down.  CUT TO:
a,"35   INT. SNOW CAT - CONTINUOUS                                   35 Steve turns the headlights in the opposite direction, just missing the helmet falling past his windshield."
parker,NOOOO!!!!!!
x,38   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                   38 The three shiver uncontrollably.
r,Finally.
parker,My face is burning.
a,DAN The power is coming back on soon.
parker,No it isn't.
lynch,"Me neither. I use my phone. Hold on, let me just run back to the"
parker,Stop.
lynch,Crunch Berries...
parker,"Please, stop."
x,Apple Jacks...
dan,"Dude, quit it."
r,LYNCH ...and I'm gonna go out on a limb and say Lucky Charms pre-purple horseshoes.
parker,Everyone went home.    They left us up here.
lynch,SOMEBODY HELP US!!
x,His voice is getting hoarse.
r,I don't want to die up here.
dan," You're not gonna die, baby. I"
dan, It's alright. It's alright.
parker,Shayna.   My puppy.
dan,Disneyworld in 8th grade.
lynch,"Hmm...guess that leaves me. I'm gonna go with...oh yeah...these skis! Get it? MY SKIS. How ironic, huh?  Silence."
x,"Parker takes off her glove to light a cigarette.  As she struggles with the lighter, the glove falls out of her lap and lands on the ground below them."
r,PARKER Shit!
parker,Shut-up.
dan,I'm jumping. I'm gonna get help.
parker,"No.    No, don't leave me up here."
dan,"Parker, I can do this. Even if I get hurt, as long as I can get to the bottom I....your skin is so red. You're getting frost bite."
lynch,"You can't get frost bite that fast. It's only been- what, like...how long has it been? A few hours, tops?  Dan inspects Parker's face. It's tough to see in the dark,"
x,but the tip of her nose and her right cheek  is discoloring.
r,Don't leave me.
dan,I'll get help. Lynch is here. He'll be with you.
lynch,"Dan, it's a far drop.     I don't know."
parker,"No, no, no. Please don't jump down there, Dan. You'll get hurt."
lynch,How are you going to find your way in the dark?
dan,I'll stick to the trail. I'll ride to the bottom.
x," You don't get a fresher run than this, right?  Dan drops his snowboard down."
r,It lands sticking up straight in the snow.  DAN  OK.
a,Parker and Lynch look back at him.      They don't know what to say.  Lynch tries to grab on to Dan's arm.
dan,One.
x,"You're gonna be OK, baby.  ...and he is gone.  From his point of view "
r,we drop  from the chair all the way to the frozen ground below.  CUT TO:
a,39   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                             39 CRACK! Both of Dan's legs shatter from the impact. Viscera protrudes out of his snow pants as his leg bones shoot out the top of his knees.
parker,DAN!   DANNY? Oh my god!
lynch,"Dan, say something.     Are you alright?"
lynch,"Oh, shit."
parker,"Can you move? Dan?  Hold on. Hold on, baby.  Lynch stops her."
x,LYNCH What are you doing?
parker,I gotta...I have to get to him.
r,"LYNCH You'll just get hurt, too.   Stop. Calm down."
a,"PARKER Calm down?!  Talk to me, Danny!  CUT TO:"
dan,Stay there. Don't get off the
dan,It's bad. It's really fucking bad.  SOMEONE HELP US! PLEASE!
lynch,OK. Alright. You gotta stay
x,"strong for me, Parker. Can you do that?  He looks every which way, trying to come up with a solution."
r,"LYNCH  If we go to pieces we're never gonna get through this, OK?"
a,What are we gonna do?     We're gonna die up here.
lynch," Buddy, can you move at all?"
dan,...so much blood.  CUT TO:
x,PARKER  Can you stop the bleeding?
r,DAN  With what?
parker,Here...
a,She takes off her scarf and tosses it below.  It blows away into the trees.       It doesn't even make it halfway.
lynch,"Here you go, Dan.     I'm throwing mine down."
dan,What do I do with this?
x,DAN I'm so cold.  CUT TO:
r,49   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                 49 Parker starts to take off her coat.
a,"PARKER Here, take my coat.  DAN  No! Don't you take off your coat!"
parker,"No, I'll be OK. I can huddle next to Lynch. Please-"
dan,I...I've got it.
parker,Are you sure.
x,DAN Yup.  Thunder shakes the mountain side.
r,Moments pass with only their breathing.  LYNCH  Are you sure you can't try and get
a,"down the hill, buddy?"
lynch,Alright.   Hold on.
parker,You think you can pull yourself across that many chairs?
lynch,I can't even do a pull-up.
x,LYNCH There was no reason to embarrass myself. I knew I couldn't do it.  DAN 
r,You can too. Remember Jenny Bluth? She fucking did it. You can do it.
lynch,Even if I made it across to the
lynch,"Shit, that's far."
parker,"What if you fall, too?"
lynch,"Parker...if we just sit here, we're gonna freeze to death."
parker,Maybe...maybe in the morning someone else will come up here.
x,"Maybe, they'll need to do maintenance on the lift or something, you know?  DAN "
r,What's going on up there?     You guys?
parker,"We're right here, baby."
a,"LYNCH Yeah, man. We didn't go anywhere. I think...I think I'm gonna try and climb back to the pole. If the chair is close enough, maybe..."
lynch,"It's funny. But I was never afraid of heights, until like...right now."
parker,What can I do to help?
x,"LYNCH Just hold on to my legs. You can't really stop me from falling...but it's, you know...psychological or something you know?"
r,"Parker maneuvers herself to hold Joe's legs..  Joe tries to move into a standing position, but panics."
parker,I think we should wait til morning. We can make it a few more hours.
parker,"Baby, is that you?"
lynch,Shh!
dan,"Oh, motherfucker."
x,CUT TO:
r,Lynch tries to control the panic.
lynch,It's alright man. It's just a
a,"coyote or something. They're scared of people. It probably won't even come anywhere near us, OK?  DAN "
lynch,Just relax. When's the last time you heard of a wolf attack in New England?
dan,I read about one on-line somewhere last year. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
parker,"It could be worse, right?  DAN  How the hell...could this be worse?  Long pause..."
x,PARKER It could be the Sarlacc Pit.  They can't believe it...but Dan and Lynch both actually
r,laugh. It's uncomfortable and forced as hell. But it's a laugh.
lynch,Parker- coming through with the
lynch,Nothing.   Just be quiet.
lynch,Please stop talking.
x,58   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                            58 Shards of ice fall down around Dan.   He covers his head for
r,"protection.  LYNCH  Hold on, down there. I think once I can stand on the back- I should"
a,be able to reach the top.  More chunks of ice shower down around Dan.  Finally the falling ice subsides.
parker, Oh shit!
x,CUT TO:
r,Dan doesn't take his eyes off of the wolf.      He is shaking in fear.
a,"What the hell do I do?  The wolf sniffs at the air and then growls again, this time baring it's teeth. It smells the blood.  DAN "
x,Yeah.   I'm alive.  Lynch slides his remaining pole in between the bars on the chair back and rests it there.
r,LYNCH See? What did I tell you? They're more scared of you than you are of them.
a,"DAN  I don't know. I'm pretty scared, I gotta be honest."
lynch,It's just a dog. That's all it is.
parker,Are you keeping warm down there?
x,He motions wiping his face.
r,Ow!   It feels like...like sunburn.
parker,What?
parker,I don't..I can't see anything.    I
parker,But it itches now...
lynch,I know- but if you keep touching your face it's gonna rub off.
x, You gotta move faster up there.
lynch,"I'm trying man, I'm trying."
r,"Lynch slowly lifts himself up onto the back of the chair, which bends at an awkward angle.  From above him we can see the long drop down, and as he"
parker,Careful.
lynch,"DAN, STOP TALKING."
parker,Don't look down.
x,"With one hand in front of the other, Lynch hoists himself about two feet off of the chair and into the air."
r, Slippery.
parker,Do you got it?
a,"LYNCH Shh.  He slides out a little bit more, his feet dangling high above the ground."
parker,What's wrong?
lynch,Please no.     Please no...
parker,I got you.
x,"PARKER  What's wrong?  He looks at her, icy tears in his eyes.    His face is white."
r,PARKER  What happened?  Finally Lynch grabs her face in his hands.    He gets close to
a,her.
lynch,Don't look down.
lynch,"Don't look down there, Parker."
dan,Oh shit.   Oh shit.
x,65   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                     65 Lynch doesn't look down.       He just stares at Parker.
a,DON'T LET HER LOOK.
lynch,I WON'T.
x,"Lynch continues to hold his hands over Parker's ears and keep her eyes pointed at his as the sounds of Dan's demise echo through the night.  The sounds of clothes being shredded, flesh being torn, and"
r,bones popping from their joints creates a chorus of pain below.  Dan doesn't scream as much as does cry out in pain and agony.
a,The camera never sees it.   Only Lynch and Parker's faces.  After what seems to be an unbearable minute...the sounds from below begin to dissipate.  Eventually Dan's remains can be heard dragging away.
lynch,I should...try and...
parker, Why did you let him jump?
x,Lynch turns and looks at her in disbelief.
lynch,You can't be fucking serious.
r,PARKER It was too far.
lynch,He said he could do it. You didn't
lynch,You're his girlfriend! I didn't see you throwing yourself in front of him!
lynch,"Oh, but he would have listened to me? I said it was a bad idea! I"
parker,But you... You should have...
lynch,What?   Say it.
parker,I didn't say that.
x,"But you want to! It's OK. I get it. It should have been me down there cause who gives a fuck about me, right?"
r,Parker feels terrible.    She puts her hand on his shoulder.
parker,"No, no, I-"
lynch,You know what? If we hadn't spent the whole fucking day on the bunny slope watching you fall on your ass
parker,I'm sorry.
parker,That's not fair!
lynch,And it's not fair that my best friend is DEAD!
parker,I'm sorry! I didn't mean it!     I'm just- I'm just-
lynch,-Fuck you.
x,"chest, letting it all out.  Eventually, Lynch can't help but feel compassion for her.    He puts his arm around her."
r,"LYNCH  I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Parker."
a,A67   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - LATER                                A67 Snow has now almost completely covered any of Dan's remains that were left on the scene. Only the tip of a boot and a piece of jacket are visible.
lynch,"5022. 429-5022. I'm so gonna call that girl when we get home. And you know what? I'm gonna marry her. No messing around. I'm just gonna be like ""Hey Shannon, it's me Joe from the chair lift. Will you marry me?"" And then we're gonna get a house and have 2 kids and a dog named Steve."
parker,Who's gonna pay for the house.
lynch,She will.    Shannon's got a great
x,job.
parker,What does she do.
r,"Lynch makes something up...but continues to have no expression in his words. Despite his talk, his spirit is shattered."
a,She...an orthodontist.
parker,Orthodontists make a lot of money.
parker,I bet you guys will be really happy.
parker,"Who names their dog ""Steve""."
lynch,I will.
parker,"Steve's a ""people"" name."
lynch,Says who?
x,"You don't like walk into someone's house and have them say ""Here's my dog Steve."""
r,Why not?    Steve's a good name for a dog.
parker,"""Here, meet my cat Chris."""
lynch,What kind of pizza should we get at Papa Gino's?
lynch,She won't starve to death and you're not going to die.
parker,No one else has a key to my place.
x,LYNCH The neighbors will break the door down if she doesn't stop barking. Someone will figure it out. She'll be fine.
r, And so will you. So will we.  He puts an arm around her and huddles closely trying to shield the wind.
parker,Dan and I were spending Christmas with my parents this year. We won't be there though. 
x,The camera pulls back wider and wider until their chair is lost in the wet snowfall and darkness.  Slowly we fade to black as the wind howls and thunder gently rolls...
r,FADE TO BLACK.  FADE IN:
a,70   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - THE NEXT MORNING                           70 Dawn is breaking over the trees.  Lynch and Parker are still. Their bodies are huddled
parker,Uhh...
x,"After what feels like an eternity, she gives her hand one last jerk, freeing it from the safety bar.  PARKER  Ruuugh!"
r,"Her movement startles Lynch awake, and he bolts upright as if from a `falling nightmare'.  Discombobulated, Lynch turns back and forth frantically"
parker,What?
lynch,Your frost-bite.   It's getting...worse.
parker,Really?    How bad is it?
lynch,Don't.    It's bad.
x,PARKER It's not as itchy any more.
r,"Just don't touch your face, OK? When we get out of here, we'll get you to a doctor right away and they'll fix it."
lynch,"They'll fix me, too then.   Just"
parker,For what?
parker,No one's gonna look for me. I skip class all the time. By the time anyone notices I'm gone I'll be dead.
lynch,Can you please just think ONE positive thing? Please!
parker,Besides.   No one knows we're here.
lynch, HEL-LO!!! WE NEED HELP!!      HELP!!!
x,"His voice echoes off of the frozen trees, almost as if taunting him.  He turns around to look at the chairs behind him."
r,LYNCH  Alright. Look. If I can get to that chair...two back...I could make it to the ladder on that pole. I think I could make it down.
parker,I just wish I could stand up. Get out of this position for a minute.
lynch,"If you want, you can stand on the chair and I can hold onto you."
parker,No.     I can't.
lynch,"Well, if anything's gonna get you over your fear of heights, it's this."
x,PARKER  No. I'm fine.
r,LYNCH Alright.  CUT TO:
a,71   EXT. CHAIR LIFT LINE - LATER                                     71 The bottom of the mountain looks like it has been abandoned.  Empty ski racks.
x,73   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - LATER                                        73 They both sleep.
r,"Finally, Lynch stirs and checks Parker to see if she is still breathing.  It appears she is not."
a,LYNCH Hey...hey Parker...  He lightly shakes her.
lynch,"Shit, I thought you stopped breathing..."
parker,What's wrong?
lynch,Nothing.
parker,Yeah.
x,onto the ground.  Lynch is once again trying to maneuver himself up onto the chair back as Parker holds him steady.
r,"LYNCH OK.   1...2...3-  He hoists himself up onto the cable briefly, but after just a few seconds, he returns his feet to the chair back."
a,Parker holds onto his legs tightly.  LYNCH  I feel like I gained about 100 pounds overnight.
lynch,I have no strength.
parker,Maybe later.
lynch,What? Like I'm gonna feel better if I wait a little longer? I should have done it last night while I still had some strength.
parker,There's more snow fall on the ground and it's all fresh. Maybe the jump won't be as bad now.
lynch,Even if it was a foot deeper- it
x,wouldn't break that fall. I should have just climbed across last night. I had strength. I had adrenaline.
r,PARKER What do you want me to do?
lynch,Nothing.   Let's sit and do nothing.
a,"She reaches into her pocket and removes her cigarettes.     The box is damp, but the cigarettes inside are still dry.  She starts to remove one but her gloved left hand and her numb right hand make her fumble the pack."
parker,How come you never have a girlfriend?
lynch,How am I supposed to answer that?
parker,"I mean, you're a decent guy. Girls dig you. But you never stay in a relationship."
lynch,I had a serious girlfriend once.
x,PARKER High School doesn't count.
parker,Who?
lynch,She um... same favorite movie as me. E.T. It was like soul mates
parker,So then... what happened?
lynch,"Same old shit.  No. You know what happened? She liked another guy. This fucking fraternity douchebag named Dean who kept sending her flowers and stuff. I don't know who it was exactly, but every time I'd go to her room some guy named ""Dean"" had left her notes and shit."
parker,Why did she keep it? Was she trying to make you jealous?
lynch,I don't know. I think she just liked getting attention.
x,PARKER So she dumped you for a frat guy?
parker,That's messed up.
parker,You just walked out?
lynch,"Yup. Told her to go laugh with ""Dean the Frat guy"". I was out."
parker,That sucks.
lynch,"Maybe... maybe I shouldn't have been so quick to walk out. Maybe I needed to have a thicker skin and not be such a sensitive bitch, I don't know. Sometimes I think I was just insecure and maybe I"
x,screwed up.
parker,You should call her. When you get home. You could tell her that.
r,LYNCH I can't.  She's dating Dean.
parker,I should have done something.
lynch,There was nothing either of us could have done.
parker,He was the one. He was the boy I was gonna marry.
lynch,"Funny story. First grade, we all get left there for the day by our mom's. You know, alone in real school for the first time without our folks around. And Dan... Dan was this sort of chubby kid when he was little..."
x,"LYNCH  And all the mom's left and he just wouldn't let go of his mom's hand. He just stood there after she left, at the front of the room, crying"
r,like a total pussy.
parker,Sounds like Dan.
parker,And so he had to sit with you?
parker,I loved him so much.
lynch,"But if he died only for you and me to give up and die up here, that's bullshit."
parker,Yes.
x,"LYNCH So I need you to pull it together, and we're gonna get out of this shit. We're gonna get out of this"
r,for Dan. Alright?
parker,Yes.
a,Lynch bites his severely chapped lips.
lynch,Help me up.
parker,Are you OK? Do you have it?
lynch,Rrruh!
parker,Oh my god!
x,"The chair leans hard to the right side, forcing Parker to slide down into what is now the bottom corner of the chair.  The chair is still in place, but it is now hanging by one"
r,bolt and at a severe angle.  PARKER  Joe!    JOE!
a,"Joe tries to look back over his shoulder, struggling to keep himself on the cable against his own body weight and wet clothing."
lynch,"Shit!    Hold on, just hold on!"
lynch,Rrrugh!
parker,You can do it. Please do it.
x,Arrrrr!
parker,JOE!
r,He reaches up and grabs hold again...his strength is weaning.
lynch, Got it.
parker,The chair is gonna fall!
lynch,No.    No it's not.
x,Take that Jenny Bluth!
parker,You made it!
r,LYNCH Not yet.   Halfway.  He looks behind him at the next chair. Just a few feet back from it is the giant green lift pole... and a ladder!
a,LYNCH  Please.  He stands up on the chair and reaches up to the cable.   He is weak.
parker,What?
parker,Oh shit.
x,"Hey. Halfway to me is better than up there with you, right?  Shit."
r,"He starts to pull himself up again, but turns back to Parker one more time.  The chair has settled down."
parker," Please god, don't let me fall. Don't let me fall."
lynch,Shit.
x,PARKER WHAT?
lynch,NOTHING.
r,He assesses the situation.  It's going to take a big leap to try and get near the ladder and he is winded beyond belief.
lynch,"NOTHING.    I'M GONNA GO FOR IT, OK?"
lynch, OK.
x,"PARKER YOU DID IT! YOU DID IT!  With his bad arm dangling by his side, Lynch works his way down the icy metal ladder."
r,Finally he reaches the ground and his body falls with a THUD into the snow.
a,"Oooof!  The wolves' ears are at attention.     They watch carefully from the safety of the bushes.  One, the LEADER, takes a cautious single step forward and"
parker,LYNCH!? LYNCH!!!  ANSWER ME!!!
lynch,PARKER.
lynch,I'M GONNA GO GET HELP.       I'M GONNA GET RESCUE.
x,CUT TO:
r,PARKER Hurry.   Please.  CUT TO:
a,"80   EXT. BELOW THE CHAIR - CONTINUOUS                               80 Lynch gets himself to his feet. His body is in massive pain, but his adrenaline is going strong enough for him to fight"
lynch,I'M GONNA GET YOU HELP!
x,A second wolf rushes Lynch from behind and grabs his injured arm by the jacket and pulls back and forth.  LYNCH  ARGH!
r,The rest of the wolves quickly reveal themselves in the bushes and slowly saunter up towards the impending kill.  CUT TO:
a,81   EXT. CHAIR LIFT - CONTINUOUS                                 81 Parker looks from Lynch to the ground way below her.
lynch,AHHHHH!    STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME!
x,Parker sobs.
parker,OK.
r,"LYNCH Just don't move!     I'm getting help!  Without hesitation, Lynch throws down Dan's board and lays"
a,his body on top of it. Pushing off he begins to slide quickly down the hill.  CUT TO:
x,HARD CUT TO:
r,The morning sun hits Parker's pale face.   Is she dead?  Parker opens her eyes. She must have drifted off for the night. She looks to the tree-line around her.
a,The sun is coming up.  She tries to move her body to look back in Lynch's direction and the chair argues back at her with another loud groan and cable noise.
x,"PARKER  AHHHH!  WHIRRR! WAP! No longer attached with the safety bolts, the"
r,"chair falls several feet and then stops. It is now hanging only by the one weak thread of cabling that was used to initially wire it to the main line.  Parker's hands catch at the base of the chair, and she is"
x,She is in tremendous pain but feels the solid ground beneath her like a sailor who has found land for the first time in years.  Surveying the damage- her ankle is badly broken underneath
r,the side of the chair that landed on it. Her boot is at an unnatural angle.  Adrenaline overtakes her pain as she lifts the chair up and removes her foot from beneath it.
a,"She looks around for her snow board, but with all of the fresh snowfall it is buried and gone.  Parker lays her body down flat on her jacket and begins to push herself down the mountainside as quickly as she can."
r,"She makes eye contact with the beast, who stares back at her, almost daring her to try and take it's treasure.  Others from the pack look up, distracted briefly, but then go back to feeding.  Parker and the pack leader lock eyes.  Finally, the leader turns away from Parker, back to his food.  Back to his family.  Though her face is emotionless, Parker's eyes are swollen with tears as she continues on her way down the mountain side.  She is free."
x,"BEEP! A HONKING CAR races past with it's windshield wipers blaring.  Narrowly missing being splattered, she collapses in the dirty road."
a,All that she can do is clutch the ground.
parker,Please.   Stop.
driver,Hey!   Are you OK?!   Hello!
x,"DRIVER  Hold on, hold on- we're gonna get you help...  He lifts her up into his arms and races her back to his car."
driver, I don't know. I found her laying in the road alone. Looks like she was in some sort of accident. Right outside of Mount Holliston. I'm taking her to you now.
driver,"Hold on, Ma'am. The hospital is 10 minutes away. You're gonna be OK."
