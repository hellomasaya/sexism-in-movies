Speaker,Dialogue
driver,Hey!
backpack,Keep it.
driver,I don't want your money.    And I already have a watch.
backpack,"If you don't take it, I'm gonna throw it away. I don't want to know what time it is, what day it is, or where I am. "
driver, Take em.
backpack,"Hey, do me a favor, will ya?     Take a picture of me."
driver,You gonna be alright?
backpack,I'll be better than that. 
billie,Here they are.
carine,Who wrote that?
chris,"Well, it could've been either one of us, couldn't it?"
carine,"Thanks, big brother.  They exit the car and frame."
billie,"You scared the daylights out of me, jumping on to that stage, oh my god."
walt,"Congratulations, son."
chris,I'm starving.
chris,"My grades are gonna be good enough, I think, to get into Harvard Law. WALT That's a big deal. What do you have left in your college fund?"
chris,"It's an inheritance, dad. I've only been spending it as a college fund...Exactly twenty-four thousand five hundred dollars and sixty-eight cents."
billie,That's very specific.
chris,I had to go to the bank this morning.
walt,"Well, we'll certainly contribute the balance for Harvard."
chris,Yeah. I've got to figure out what I'm going to do. I got a lot of things to pack and organize here first.
billie,I'm so glad you're getting out of that place you're living. It was so much nicer when you lived on campus.
walt,"You'll come to Annandale before you disappear on us, won't you?"
chris," Sure, I will."
billie,You promise?
chris, Mom.
billie,"Well, your father and I want to make a present to you. WALT We want to get you out of that junker. CHRIS What's a junker?"
walt,Yes.   We want to get you a new car.
billie,"We weren't going to get you a Cadillac, Chris. Just a nice new car that's safe to drive. You don't know when that thing's just going to suddenly blow up."
chris,"Blow up? Blow up?! Are you guys crazy? It's a great car. I don't need a new car. I don't want a new car. I don't want anything. Thing, thing, thing."
walt,Everything's gotta be difficult.
chris,I said thank you. I just don't want anything.
carine,I wouldn't say no to a new car.
chris," Seriously, I'll pay you back."
chris,This is Emory University freshman Chris McCandless reporting from the vault at Thompson Hall.
os student,What is this? Filmmaking 101?
chris, Pay no attention to the voices behind the curtain.
chris,"Ted! We've got a monster in the vault. It represents all the corruption, the deceit, and greed within us all. I must slay it."
chris,Ted! I know how to kill it. And I'm the only one who knows. You can't keep sending me on stories and expecting me to do nothing! I look like some kind of an idiot.
panicked student,McCandless! You've got to hurry! The monster is scratching at the hatchway. He'll be out in no time.
chris," That's it, Ted. Fire me if you want but this beast must be slayed. Microphone in hand, Chris makes haste. The CAMERA RUNS WITH HIM out the door, through the corridor, up a set of steps to the hatchway. As he arrives, the monster appears above him in the hatchway crawl space having pulled off the board Chris had nailed."
forest ranger,U.S. Forestry. Could you step out of the tent please?
forest ranger, I don't blame you. You're less than a hundred yards from the nearest den. That's why I came over here to talk to you. Do you have some identification?
chris,No. I'm sorry. My name's Alex. I've been travelling a lot and I got robbed and my identification was taken.
forest ranger,You mind if I take a look in your tent?
chris,Go ahead.
forest ranger,"You're not the character who knocked down our sign, are ya?"
chris, No.
forest ranger,Because there was a sign indicating that camping was allowed by permit only.
chris,"Well, I don't have a permit."
forest ranger,"No, I'm sure you don't. Listen, it looks like you've got your food secured pretty good, so I'm not gonna make you move on tonight. But, these bears out here are nursing young and you know how that goes. Next time, stop at the Rangers station and get yourself a permit."
chris,Alright. I appreciate it. I'm gonna be headed towards the coast tomorrow.
forest ranger,Be careful.
chris," Is that a man mommy? That's no mere man, sweetheart. That's Alexander SuperTramp! King of the wild frontier!"
driver,This is where I turn off.
chris,Alright man.    Thanks a lot.
policeman,How're you doin' this evening?
chris, I'm alright. What's the matter?
policeman,You wanna put your backpack down on the hood of my car.
chris,Why?
policeman,"Because I asked you to, sir."
chris,But I haven't done anything wrong.   These are my personal items.
policeman,Do you know that it's unlawful to hitchhike on this stretch of highway. CHRIS You're kidding.
policeman,Do you see a safe area for a vehicle to stop? We got a tree-lined highway without a substantial shoulder here. And we've had a lot of accidents on this road from people stopping in the traffic lane for hitchhikers.
chris,"Alright, but...I mean, you stopped your car. You're in the traffic lane. And you can see, there's hardly any cars out here. Plus, it's a straight road; you can see for a long ways. "
policeman,May I see some identification?
chris,I don't have any.
policeman,You don't have any identification?
chris, McCandless. Christopher Johnson McCandless.
jan,"Hi. We just barely saw you there, under that crazy hat of yours. We couldn't back up - the van's reverse is broken. CHRIS  Oh.   That's okay. Thanks for stopping."
jan,"This door's a little tricky, I'll get it."
rainey,"Hey, I'm Rainey."
jan,And I'm Jan.
chris,"Hey, Rainey.    Hi Jan.    I'm Alex."
rainey,Alex of the hat.
chris, Yeah.
rainey,Were you out there a long time hitching?
chris,Couple of days. But sometimes I forget to put my thumb out.
jan,"Probably, the rest of the time, that hat scares `em away."
chris, See that? I've got this book and it shows you all the plants and berries that are edible. You can find things wherever you go.
rainey,"We were just in town getting some beads and stuff. Jan does handicrafts, so we're usually going from one swap meet to another. She's so good at what she does, we sold everything. So, we set up camp at Orick Beach. You're welcome to camp there with us."
jan,And eat there with us.
chris," So, I just left the car. It was a great car too. I'd driven it cross country the first time when I got out of high school. I had some really great adventures with it. That thing would just go and go. I mean, it was an `82 but if I'd kept it, it would've lasted me forever. RAINEY So, you're a leather now. CHRIS I'm a leather?"
jan,"You're a leather tramp. That's what they call the ones that hoof it on foot. So, we're technically rubber tramps."
rainey, As we have a vee-hi-cle.
jan,Alex could have a vehicle. If he didn't burn his money. Why would you want to do that?
chris,I don't need money.   It makes people cautious.
jan," Well, you have to be a little cautious Alex. That book of yours is all well and fine but you can't depend entirely on leaves and berries."
chris,I don't know if you'd want to depend on much more than that.
jan,Where's your mom and dad?
chris,Makin' their money somewhere.
jan,Come on Chris. You look like a loved             * kid. Be fair.                                    * CHRIS Fair?
jan,You know what I mean.
chris,"I'll paraphrase Thoreau -- ""Rather than          * love, than money, than fairness, give me         * truth.""                                          *"
rainey," Geez. If I struck a match to you, I'd have warmth and dinner at the same time."
chris,Where's Jan going?
rainey,"Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front."
chris,I think so.
rainey,You think what?
chris,I think she's probably quietly disconnecting. It doesn't feel right to her to be close to you if there's a hole of some kind somewhere else.
rainey,"That's a helluva insight. Jesus!... You're not Jesus, are you? You gonna walk on that water and get her back for me?"
chris,"Actually, I'm a little afraid of water."
rainey,I'll carry.   Shit-yes I'll carry.
jan, That's not hot enough. Put your arms around me.
chris,I'm going to go down the beach a ways and read a little bit. I'll bring the rest of that wood back before nightfall.
rainey,Alright. We might take a run into town to grab some food for tonight.
chris,Sounds good.
jan,"You know what Alex ought to do, Rainey? He ought to come out to the Slabs this winter."
rainey,Oh yeah.
chris,What is that? The Slabs?
rainey,"It's down in Niland, California.   You know where the Salton Sea is?"
chris,"Near San Diego, yeah?"
rainey,"Well about 200 miles Northeast of there, but yeah. Niland's off the east shore of Salton. Wild place. The navy bulldozed and abandoned a base there. All that's left is a grid of concrete foundations. They're scattered over about a square mile or so."
jan,"When the weather turns cold across the rest of the country, people show up there by the thousands: snow birds... RAINEY Drifters..."
jan,Sundry vagabonds...
jan,Livin' on the cheap under the sun.
chris,You sell your handcrafts there?
jan,"Oh yeah. And a lot of second-hand goods. There's a swap meet. The people are cool. There's even some kids running around sometimes. Most everyone there, if they're not avoiding the cold, are at least dodging the IRS."
rainey,Or the FBI.   CIA! DDT!!!
jan,"It's good. You should check it out. If you come, I'll make a proper hat for you.  Looks like you got yourself a good bag there."
chris,Yeah...my mother made it from a kit.
jan,He reminded me...
rainey,I know. Go to WIDE SHOT: Jan and Rainey remaining as they were. FOREGROUND: Seagulls GLIDE THROUGH FRAME.
carine,"The year Chris graduated high school he bought the Datsun, used. He wanted to drive it cross-country and visit our old neighborhood in California. The day before he left was my dad's birthday. Chris made a speech..."
chris," Dad, you and I have had our differences over the years...but on your birthday I want to tell you how grateful I am for all the things you've given me. And that you did it starting from nothing to working your way through college and busting your ass to support us kids. So, in return, I've been busting my ass a bit...at Domino's Pizza -"
walt, Would you look at that. Walt holds the telescope up for all to see.   And the party responds with applause.
carine,"Jesus, you must've had a lot to drink."
chris,"Too much and not enough. I used to believe all that stuff. That whole story. I thought maybe if I said it again, I'd believe it. But I don't."
carine,"And that one lie had led to another. That two years after Chris was born, dad had had another son with Marcia. Worse yet was that it was Marcia to whom he was still legally married at the time. And it was Chris and I who were the bastard children."
carine,"Dad's arrogance made him conveniently oblivious to the pain he caused. And mom, in the shame and embarrassment of a young mistress, became his accomplice. "
chris, Hi Wayne. Alex McCandless.
wayne,"Seems like every time I come on this road, there's somebody hitching out here who looks as skinny and unfed as you."
chris,"Oh, I wouldn't want to burden you."
wayne,How long has it been since you've had anything to eat?
chris,Couple of days. I kinda ran out of money.
wayne,"Well, there's no choice about it.    I'm gonna get you some dinner."
wayne,So where is it you're headed?
chris,I was thinking about doubling back through the Canadian side of Glacier Park.
wayne,"Yeah, I used to have a girlfriend who'd go there, camp on the Black Feet Res. She was into all that American Indian stuff. "
chris,"Well, that'd be great.   What do you do out here?"
wayne,"Well, I do a lot of things. Computer programming. Video game repair. I'm a licensed pilot, own a grain elevator in Carthage and another one a few miles out of town. But in the summertime I run a combine crew, follow the harvest from Texas way the hell north to the Canadian border. We just got done cutting barley for Coors and Anheuser Busch. But then I got this little black box deal on the side "
chris,You mean those free satellite TV deals?
wayne," You said it, not me."
chris,Who are these guys?
wayne,Those are my Hudderites. Agriculture's a pretty transient business. These guys come off the Hudderite colony looking for work. I always got work for people. Then that guy - 
chris,Madison.    Okay.
wayne,"Listen, you don't want to go out there on the road tonight. Why don't you just roll your sleeping bag out and play like a Hudderite until morning."
chris,Thanks Wayne. I will.
wayne,Get a good sleep. See you in the morning.
wayne,"I'm gonna break out some whiskey. Alex, you want anything other than that beer?"
chris,I'd take a White Russian if you've got it.
chris,"No, I just like White Russians."
wayne,"I haven't got anything like that here. But I tell ya what. And I know I speak for everybody. You wanna come work with us in Carthage, we'll hook you up on the grain elevator and get you a White Russian down at the Cabaret."
chris,Really?
wayne,"Dawn tomorrow, engines roaring.  ""Pot o Gold. Oh that pot o gold."""
all,"""Pot o Gold.    Gotta get that pot o gold!"""
chris, To Carthage.
wayne,"Okay Kevin, get all the machines back to the elevator. I'm gonna show Chris to his room."
wayne," First come, first serve buddy. Wayne signs off and veers off the road."
wayne, Come on up in here. This'll be your room for as long as you hang about.  Wayne opens the door at the top of the stairs.
wayne,"Shower's down the hall. If you hurry you can beat the rest of the boys to it. But you do want to grab a shower cause we're all heading over to the Cabaret in exactly thirty-six minutes. So, get your dancing shoes on. There's foo-foo in the medicine cabinet. I think it's Brut.  Then you want to put your charm in overdrive cause we like to PAH-TAY!"
wayne,"Alex, this is Gail . This is the one to go to for that White Russian you've been wanting. Of course the quid pro quo can be hazardous."
gail,"Shut up, Wayne.  You want a White Russian, sweetie?"
chris," Yes please, ma'am."
wayne,"Yes please, ma'am?"
wayne,"Anything to do with hunting, preserving the meat, smoking it or whatever, you talk to Kevin over there. That's your man."
chris,I'm thinking about going to Alaska.
wayne,"Alaska, Alaska? Or city Alaska?     The city Alaska does have markets."
chris," No, Alaska, Alaska. I want to be all the way out there. On my own. No map. No watch. No axe. Just out there. Big mountains, rivers, sky. Game. Just be out there in it. In the wild."
wayne,In the wild.
chris,"Yeah. Maybe write a book about my travels. About getting out of this sick society. WAYNE  Society, right."
chris,"Because you know what I don't understand? I don't understand why, why people are so bad to each other, so often. It just doesn't make any sense to me. Judgement. Control. All that."
wayne,"Who ""people"" we talking about?"
chris,"You know, parents and hypocrites. Politicians and pricks."
wayne," This is a mistake. It's a mistake to get too deep into that kind of stuff. Alex, you're a helluva young guy, but I promise you this: You're a young guy. Blood and fire! You're juggling blood and fire!"
gail, Who are you to be giving advice to anybody?
wayne,Blood and fire...What? Mr. Happy. That's who I am. Gimme a kiss.
chris,"Now, that's who could be President! Wayne buries his face in his hands. CUT TO:"
wayne,Workin' time!  CUT TO:
wayne,"So, what do you think about all this? "
chris,I like all this.
wayne, I gotta take a piss.
chris,I've been thinking a lot about Alaska.
gail,"Alaska? What kind of nut-nut are you? Alex, it's October for Christ's sake. You go to Alaska, you go in the Spring. This time of year you wanna head south. Personally, I like Las Vegas. One-armed bandit. That's what I like."
chris,"Yeah, maybe I ought to put off going to Alaska, at least so I can get settled up there in decent weather."
gail,South. You want to go south. You want me to take you out to the highway?
chris," Little lady, I walked in, I can walk out. He puts a few bills down on the bar, saddles up his backpack, and gives Gail a hug."
gail,"You take care of yourself now, Alex. You got a whole family here depending on it."
chris,"I will. Thanks Gail .   And tell Wayne, I'll drop him a line."
green suit,Can I help you?
chris,"Yeah. If I wanted to paddle down the river, where's the best place to launch out of?"
green suit,"""To launch out of?"" What's your experience level?"
chris,Not much.
green suit,Any?   Do you have a permit?
chris,"A permit for what? GREEN SUIT You can't paddle down the river without a permit. If you like, you can apply for one here, get yourself some experience, and I'll put you on the wait-list."
chris,Wait-list?   To paddle down a river?
green suit,That's right.
chris," Well, how long do you have to wait?"
chris, Twelve years?
green suit,"Well, you could always join a commercial raft trip and go with a licensed guide. They usually have a few last minute cancellations. I think it's about two- thousand dollars."
chris,Thanks for your help.
chris, I'm Superman. SuperTramp.
mads, Hello!
chris,Hello.
mads,You can join us!
chris,Hi. Alex.
sonja,I am Sonja.
mads,We are from Copenhagen.   And you are from the rapids.
chris,I am.
sonja,"My Got! MADS Crazy man. You're a crazy man!    Sonja, he is a crazy man.  I'll make you a hotdog."
chris,Well...
mads, Because that's crazy! You come down the rapids. What do you want on your hotdog? Mustard and relish?
chris,You have ketchup?
mads,"No, I have mustard and relish."
chris,Mustard and relish it is then.
mads,"Sonja, you want a hotdog?"
sonja, Of course I want a hotdog.   Why are you stupid?
mads," She asked me why I'm stupid. And I say, well...like I ask you why you're crazy and you say ""well."" Where are you going?"
chris,I haven't decided.
mads,"We like it here very much. We went to Los Angeles. And then, we went to Las Vegas."
sonja,Las Vegas is very nice.   The universe is very good.
mads,"And then, we come here.   Maybe you go to Mexico. "
chris,How far are we from Lake Mead?
mads,"Sonja, how far is Hoover Dam?"
sonja,Maybe three hundred thirty kilometers...like two hundred miles.
chris,"Man, I wonder if I could go all the way down into the Gulf of California."
mads, I go with you. We leave Sonja here.    You and me in kayak - we go to Mexico.
sonja," You're embarrassing.   Idiot. Mads with a burst of re-exhilaration, grabs Chris' hand, shaking it violently."
mads,I like the meeting you.
chris,Thank you. I'm very happy to meet both of you too.
mads,He went thattaway!   The crazy man - he went thattaway!
sonja,Just like in the movies.
carine,"But why he didn't send a letter, maybe through a friend. I got mad. But I told myself it was good. It made me remember that there was something more than rebellion, more than anger that was driving him. Chris had always been driven, had always been an adventurer. When he was four years old..."
carine,...he once wandered six blocks away from home at three o'clock in the morning.
carine,"He was found in a neighbor's kitchen, up on a chair, digging into their candy drawer."
carine,Whatever drawer he was opening now must have something sweet in it.
immigration officer,"36 days, wow. I guess they're gonna have to watch that spillway a little better."
chris,What they ought to do is open up the dams and let the rivers flow.
immigration officer,"I can't disagree with you on that. Okay, Alexander SuperTramp. I think we're gonna let you out of here shortly but you've got two working weeks to get an ID card in the United States. You can't be crossing these borders without identification, are we understood?"
chris,"Yes, sir. I've eaten enough sand to send me back to the city anyway."
chris, One...Two...Three -
chris,As Alexander Supertramp returns to civilization...a hobo.  I'm a for real hobo.
chris,Can you tell me how to get an ID card?
social worker,Did you lose your identification sir?
chris,Yeah.
social worker,No birth certificate? Nothing?
chris,"And, if I want to apply for a job somewhere, can you help me with that?"
social worker,"If you know how to cook, we might have a space for you in our mobile kitchen. But I'll have to talk to my supervisor about it in the morning."
chris,"Alright then. Thank you. Oh, one last thing. Do you have a bed for me?"
social worker, Sure. Just fill this in and I'll get you all set up.
social worker,You leaving us so soon? I know them DMV lines are long...  CUT TO:
chris," I'm sorry, sir."
chris,"No, sir."
chris,Thanks very much.
walt,LOOK WHAT YOUR MOTHER IS MAKING ME DO!
billie,Who do you think you are?   God?
walt,Yes.   I'm God!
chris, I'll cancel Christmas!  79A.
carine, Who do you think you are? God?
chris,Yes.   I'm God.
carine,I close my eyes at night sometimes and imagine where Chris might be.
carine,Was there beauty around him?   Was he hurt? Was he alone?
carine,Was he having the great adventure that he wanted?
carine,Could he feel the changes here at home? By some kind of supernatural osmosis? Chris once wrote to me from college saying he wanted to talk to me about all the problems he had with mom and dad.
carine,He said I was the only person in the world who could've possibly understood what he had to say.
carine,"But instead when I open my eyes, what I see is my mother, sitting at the dining room table, sifting through photo albums and pictures of Chris. It's all she can do to examine the snapshots. And, though she breaks down from time to time, she studies them with a sort of hungry intensity - like looking at food you can't eat, or into a window at a family around a table that you were once a part of and can be no more."
carine,"Instincts that seem to sense the threat of a loss so huge and irreparable that the mind balks at taking its measure - I begin to wonder if I do understand what Chris is saying any longer. But I catch myself in doubt and remember that these are not the parents he grew up with. That in the forced reflection that comes with loss, indeed everything Chris is saying, has to be said. And I trust for him that everything he is doing has to be done. This is our life."
trucker,"I don't know where to drop you. Bullhead's kinda haphazard - there's no ""center."" You sure you don't want to be in Laughlin? It's casinos versus chiropractors."
chris,"Yeah, no.   This is good.   Right here."
trucker,Alright then. Chiropractors it is.
chris, Okay.
chris,"Right, right. I forgot."
lori,And please.   Hurry.   We're ten deep.
chris,Okay.
chris,How much do I have in the account now?
teller,"It looks like...let me see. Including this latest deposit...One thousand, two hundred and fifty two dollars and...twenty-two cents."
chris,What's the interest on twenty-two cents?
chris,"Lori, I'm punching out."
lori,Okay.   Just put it in the drop.
chris,"No, I mean I'm punching out for good."
lori," We've made our quota, have we? CHRIS Yeah. Also, I've got to do some things before I head north."
lori,"Alright Chris. Well, we've enjoyed knowing you. I won't be able to get that last check to you right away though."
chris,That's okay.    I'll let you know where to send it.
lori,Alright then Chris.    Bye-bye now.
chris,Bye-bye.  CUT TO:
jan,Sunni!    Come here boy.
chris,Surprise!
jan, Alex!
jan,"You have to tell us everything. (Note: This scene should largely be improvised. They all know their characters, their history. Jan and Rainey are doing great. And while Chris is intermittently aware that the eyes of a pretty 16-year old girl are upon him, Chris lays out his travels and his PLAN FOR ALASKA."
chris, She's only a teenager.
jan,Good luck.
chris,"Well, I'm waiting on a check from my last job to come into Salton City the day after Christmas. I've got to start thinking about getting ready for Alaska. When the sun gets a little lower tonight, I'm going to start a calisthenics routine. I think after the check comes in, I'll try to find some mountains I can climb everyday till spring comes. I gotta see how far the money's gonna go. "
rainey,"Well, you know, we'll give you a little something for every day you work the booth."
chris,"I'm not taking any money from you, Rainey.   It's been a real great twist meeting you two. You look like you're doing good."
rainey,"We are, and you were a big part of that, coming along when you did. Yep, things are good.  Man, I used to think Tantric sex was just a bunch of reading. Speaking of which, don't you think you ought to introduce yourself to Joni Mitchell over there?"
chris,Hi. TRACY                                 * You selling books?
chris,I am.   We are.
chris,Do you?
chris,That's good.    I heard you play your song last night.
chris,You are not terrible.
chris,No.   You sing sweet.
rainey,Go on.   I'll watch the store.
chris,I'm sorry.   This is Rainey.   And I'm Chris.
rainey,Hi. Rainey. And this is Alex.  TRACY                                  * I'm Tracy.                                            *
jan,"I wasn't much older than Tracy when I got             * pregnant. And I thought my husband and I were going to invent peace on earth and stay together forever. But it didn't work out that way. He left. History. Now ancient history. And that was the end of that. So, I raised Reno by myself - that's my son. Then I met Rainey. And that was really good for a while. But Reno was already a teenager and was becoming a man in his own way. And then, I don't know. He kinda followed in his father's footsteps - out the door and gone. And I really don't know where he is. I haven't heard from him in two years."
chris,I hope I get to meet him sometime. Jan looks into Chris' eyes and smiles with pure love. She leans over and gently kisses Chris on the cheek.
jan,Do your folks know where you are?
jan,"No, sweetheart. Just hungry. You've been doing a fantastic job over there.  Shall we eat?"
chris,Yeah.
rainey,I really ought to get myself doing that.
chris,You should Rainey. Makes that Tantric stuff go even better.
rainey,"How the hell would you know? That poor girl over there is about ready to vault onto a fence post. And here you are, the monk of Jack LaLane."
chris,Me too.
rainey,For what?
rainey,Don't you think they ought to?
chris,"They should. But I can't. Not yet, anyway. I got a sister though, Carine. She's the most beautiful girl in the world. But, it's all got to stay behind me until I get where I'm going."
rainey,Alaska?
chris,"Yeah, Rainey. Alaska.  Rainey won't intrude any further. He just nods. Chris notices Tracy in the door of her parent's rig, stealthily       * waving him over. Chris gives Rainey the ""Uh-oh"" look, pulls on his T-shirt, and walks over to the rig. Tracy          * has disappeared inside.  CUT TO:"
chris,Hello?    Merry Christmas?
chris, What?
chris,"No, I mean, no, we can't do that."
chris,How old are you?
chris,What year were you born?
chris,"You can always get in touch with me by sending mail here. I don't know when I'll get it, but I'll get it."
chris,You're pretty magic.
rainey,"You take care of yourself, kiddo."
chris,"You too, Rainey. Thanks for everything."
jan, Just get your pack out of the back and get out of here. I can't take a hug.
chris, Beautiful dog.
the girl,Thank you.
chris,"Go on, boy.    Go on."
ron,Where's your camp?
chris, Out past Oh-My-God Hot Springs.
ron,I've lived in and around here six years now and I've never heard of any place that goes by that name.
chris,Alex.
ron,"Alex.    Where are you from Alex? CHRIS West Virginia. RON Okay, Alex from West Virginia. I like a fellow who doesn't raise the pitch of his voice when he talks to animals...shows he doesn't condescend."
chris,You go left here.
ron,You live here?
chris,"No, we keep going. I'm further up. Another half-mile or so, out on the Bajada."
ron,"Well, this is somethin' out here. Don't you worry about those dope smokers and nudists down below there?"
chris,"No, they keep to themselves pretty much and so do I."
ron, Hmmm. You strike me as a bright young man. Am I wrong about that?
chris,I think I got my head on my shoulders pretty good.
ron,That's what I mean.    How long have you been out here?
chris,Couple of weeks.
ron,And before that?
chris,A lot of places. I've been moving around.
ron,How old are you?
chris,Twenty-three.
ron,"Twenty-three years old! Son, don't you think you should be getting an education? And a job? And making something of this life? CHRIS Look Mr. Franz. I think careers are a twentieth century invention and I don't want one. You don't need to worry about me. I have a college education. I'm not destitute. I'm living like this by choice."
ron,In the dirt?
chris," Yeah, in the dirt."
ron,I just don't know.    Where's your family?
chris,Don't have one anymore.
ron,That's a shame.
chris,"Hey, Mr. Franz. I want to show you something."
ron,This is getting a little steep.     And a little high for me kid.
chris,"Alright.   But look out there. Even from half way out, it's quite a sight isn't it?"
ron,You can see the Salton Sea from up there?
chris,"Yes, sir."
ron, My goodness.
chris,You don't want to go up?
ron,Nope.   I don't do these kind of things.
chris,"Yeah, sure. It'll take me a couple of minutes to clean up."
ron,Fair enough.
chris,"How old are you, Mr. Franz?"
ron,Seventy-nine years old.
chris,"Seventy-nine...see, all due respect, but the real difference between people is the quality of their soul and not on how long they've trudged around like a dip-shit."
ron,It is.   No question about that.
ron,"Alex, please don't lump me in amongst your judges. And your tyrants. But I'd prefer to not hear that kind of language."
chris, Sorry. I don't usually use that kind of language either. I just get so angry thinking about it.
ron,"You got a lot of passion, young man."
chris,"Awww, that was a great time Mr. Franz. Thank you."
ron,"Look here. If Charles Manson and his buddies don't kill me on my way out of here, I'd like to cook you up a home cooked meal tomorrow night. If I come out here about, say, four o'clock tomorrow, how would that be?"
chris,That would be swell.
ron,"Good, good. I'm no gourmet but I know where the spices are. Good night, kid."
chris,Good night Mr. Franz.
ron,Did you find everything you need?
chris, Yeah. I hope I don't wreck your machine. There's a lot of grime in that stuff.
ron,"Well, that's what it's for.   How do these steaks look?"
chris,Great.
ron,"Well, sit down."
chris,You got a White Russian?
ron,Nope. CHRIS Beer?
ron,Nope. Don't have any alcohol. I had to quit all that. How about a guava juice?
chris,"I'll take a guava juice, that sounds good."
ron,"Yeah, I had a little spell with the bottle, you could say."
ron,"I spent most of my life in the army. On New Year's Eve 1957, I was stationed over in Okinawa. My wife and son were here in the States, just driving down the road when a fellow who'd had too much to drink plowed right into them. Killed them both. Anyway, you might think that the last thing in the world I'd do, is go to the whiskey, but at the time, it felt like the only thing I could do. And I did it hard. But pretty soon, I figured I wasn't doing my wife and son any good, mourning them with a bottle. So, I pulled myself together and quit drinking, cold turkey. And then..."
chris,"Yeah, I was gonna ask you."
ron,"Yeah, that's...  Fuki, Kenjiro, Yoshiko, Keiko, Masaro, Junichi, Kimpei, Nayoko..."
chris,"Do you ever travel, Mr. Franz?"
ron,"No. I can't seem to get too far from my leather. I'll show you after you finish eating. I do a lot of leather engraving. I got a little workshop in the garage. Between that and my pension, I do pretty well. But every time I think I might take a trip somewhere, I get too far behind on orders and such to consider it."
chris," Well, I'm finished eating. I'd love to see your workshop."
ron,Would ya?
chris,Anything alive in it?
ron,What's the N stand for?
chris,...North.
ron,Alaska?
chris, I could ask you the same question. Except I already know the answer.
ron,"You do, do you?"
chris,"I do, Mr. Franz. You've got to get back out in the world. Get out of that lonely house of yours, that little workshop, and go live on the road."
ron,"Sittin' on my butt, huh?"
chris,"Come on, old man! Come on!"
ron, Ya little pinhead.
chris,You alright?
ron,"I'm going to miss you when you go. CHRIS I'll miss you too, Ron. But you're wrong if you think the joy of life comes principally from human relationships. God's placed it all around us. It's in everything. In anything we can experience. People just have to change the way they think about those things. You ought to put a little camper on the back of your pick-up and go take a look at some of the great work god's done out here in the American west."
ron,Alex...You're probably right.   And I'm going to take stock of that.
chris,Holy Shit!
ron,"I told you about that language. The two men, their eyes welling up, fall back laughing."
chris,What are you doing up?     It's three-thirty in the morning.
ron,"Heard you get up off the couch half an hour ago, and had a funny feeling you might not be here for our breakfast."
chris,"Ron, you don't have to do that."
ron,I want to do it.     Get you started on this thing of yours.
chris,On my Great -
ron," I know. On your ""Great Alaskan Adventure."" From just out of Chris' eye-line, Ron leans out of frame, picking up a zippered duffel bag. He opens it, displaying the contents to Chris."
chris,Ron...
ron,"Oh, just take it."
ron,Well my friend.
chris,Yep.
chris,"How about we talk about this when I get back from Alaska, Ron. Would that be alright?"
ron," Yep.   We can do that, yep."
chris,"Thanks, Ron."
chris,...and I will tell about it.
chris,"Well, it could've been either one of us. Couldn't it?"
walt,What is it?
billie,"I wasn't dreaming! I didn't imagine it! I heard his voice, Walt. I heard Chris."
chapter 6: deliverance,FADE TO BLACK.
chris,Shit!
