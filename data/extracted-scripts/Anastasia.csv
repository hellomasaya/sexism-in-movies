phlegmenkof," You ragged, skinny, little nothing!  I have had just about enough of you . . ."
anya,About as bad as you smell!
serebreakov,I want her.
phlegmenkof,"That's horrible, skinny thing?! She's crazy - she has no memory of anything before she came here! She didn't even know her name! That one is a rotten troublemaker, willful. . ."
serebreakov,I'll break her will. . .  You will enjoy serving under me.
phlegmenkof,I couldn't break you - but he can!
gregor, Anya?
anya,No.  I'm running to.
little girl,Running to? Running to what?
anya,To find my home.
chubby girl,But you are home.
anya,No. This isn't a home - it's just a building. Home is where you belong and none of us belong here.
gregor,"Where is your home, Anya?"
anya,I'm not sure but look. . .
anya,"It says ""Together in Paris"". I was wearing this when I came here ten years ago - it's the only way that I know . . ."
chubby girl,Is your home in Paris?
anya,It might be. I have to go and find out.
anya,"I have to go now, before it gets light."
gregor, But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
anya,Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
gregor, Anya! What if we can't find anyone who loves us?!
anya,Then come find me.
anya,I think you should be more careful about who you invite to dinner!

peasant 5,Paris?!  What do they have in Paris that they don't have here?
peasant 6,Shorter lines?!
peasant 7, Nobody leaves Soviet Russia.
anya,Is this where I get traveling papers?
clerk,It would be if we let you travel which we  don't so it isn't.  Russia is the people's paradise!
anya, I didn't
clerk,No.
anya, Dmitri? There must be a million Dmitris. . .
peasant 9, Which line is this?
anya,"Excuse me, do you know Dmitri. . ."

tiny husband, Could you get rid of her moustache?
anya,Excuse me - I'm looking for a man named Dmitri. . .
artist,But I didn't write it.
dissolve to,A SIGN
actress 1," Oh, Grandmama! It's me, Anastasia! I've waited so long to see you!"
dmitri,"Vladimir, calm down!"
dmitri,For a ten million rubles reward we can look a little longer. This is the big one. . .  and all I need is the right girl.
actress 2," Oh, Grandmama! It's me, Anastasia. I've waited so long to see you."
actress 3, See you!
actress 4,Oh. . . Grandmama. . .  It's me. . .
actress 5,"Oh, Grandmama. . ."
actress 6, What's my modivation?
vladimir, Stanislavski!
actress 7,Oh. . .
dmitri,I've gotta find the right girl!
dmitri,Next.
vladimir,"It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!"
dmitri,"We will.  We have to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there."
dmitri,She could be right under our nose
dmitri, Ouch!  That really hurt!
anya,I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
dmitri,"That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy."
anya, I'm looking for Dmitri.  I need traveling papers - to Paris. I heard Dmitri could help me.
vladimir,Who did you hear it from?
anya,I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
vladimir, I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
anya,"Well, I don't have any money . . ."
vladimir,Good day!
anya,I have a bike!  Perhaps I could sell it and. . .
policeman,Nonsense.  There is no crime in the Soviet Socialist Republic.
anya,"Sorry, boy, I have to go."
vladimir,". . .  even if we find her, what makes you think the Empress will even see us?"
dmitri,She'll see us.
bartok,"You, uhh. . .  hang here often?  ""Hang"" get it?  I said ""hang"" and we're both, you know, cause we're bats. . .  and, uhhh. . . what's your sign?"
dmitri, What was that?
vladimir,That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
bartok,"Whatta' ya say we go somewhere - maybe get a bug to eat.  Get it?  A ""bug"" to eat, 'cause we're. . ."
anya,What are you do. . .
anya," DANCING BEARS, PAINTED WINGS THINGS I ALMOST REMEMBER. AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER"
vladimir,"You're trespassing, boy!"
anya,I. . .  I. . .  spoke to you earlier about traveling paper. .
dmitri, It's her.
vladimir,He's her?
dmitri,Look!
anya,"Are you Dmitri?  I didn't  mean to trespass - I don't want to do anything dishonest, but if you could just help help me. . ."
vladimir,Perhaps you heard of our brilliant plan to find a girl and. . .
dmitri," She doesn't want to do anything ""dishonest"". . ."
vladimir, Ew. . .  the honest type.
dmitri, You look like her.  Like the Princess Anastasia.  Has anyone ever told you that before?
anya," Oh, yeah - in the orphanage they constantly told me I looked like a princess! Stop that!"
dmitri,People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
anya,I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
dmitri,"You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?"
anya,I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
dmitri,Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
vladimir,How much do you weigh?
anya,"Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . ."
dmitri,Why do you want to go to Paris?
anya, I have my reasons.
dmitri,Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.  We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris. 
anya,"Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!"
dmitri,NO!  YOU LOOK AT HER!  LOOK AT HER!  It could be you.
anya, THINGS MY HEART USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARNS TO REMEMBER. . .
dmitri,Find out the truth - come to Paris with us.
anya,All right.  I will go with you.
dmitri,The Her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
bartok,Oy. . .  he's gonna be so mad. . .
anya, THINGS MY HEART USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARNS TO REMEMBER ...
dmitri,Find out the truth - come to Paris with us.
anya,All right. I will go with you.
dmitri,The Her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
bartok,Oy. . .  he's gonna be so mad...
bartok,"Ummm ... Father Gregori? It's, uhh ... me. Bartok.  Phew! Not home ..."
rasputin,What?
bartok,Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
rasputin," And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?"
bartok,Name calling! That's mature.
rasputin,I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
bartok," Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry."
rasputin," Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?"
bartok,"Yeah, right. Keep that thought okay? So, I'm in town, stop by the old palace. You get a better class of bats there - no tattoos or anything."
rasputin,Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
bartok,"Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive."
rasputin,Impossible. That rumor's been around for years.
bartok,"Trust me, it's her!"
rasputin, How do you know?
bartok,"Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which    is natural ... Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never    grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute ..."
rasputin, Source of my power. Owner of my soul. I need your help.
bartok,"Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia."
rasputin,I cursed then all!
bartok,"My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said ""Curses were made to be broken"". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound..."
rasputin,"The Romanovs tried to kill me and I swore to destroy all of them! If she lives, if she should have a child someday, the Romanov Family continues! And I won't lot that happen! THIS IS THE END OF THE LINE!"
bartok,"You know, this is really obsessive behavior. There is this doctor this doctor in Austria, Sigmund something and he feels. . ."
rasputin,YOU IDIOT
rasputin, Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
bartok, You'd lose your security deposit?
rasputin," Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ..."
bartok,"Ohhh, that was dumb..."
rasputin,Finish my prophecy...
bartok,"Ew, I hate when he does this!"
rasputin,She is not to get off that train... alive!
rasputin,Go! I don't care what you do with the others but finish the girl! KILLLLL HERRRRR!  And have fun...
tatiana,"Take her away, Sophie."
tatiana,Haven't anything better to do than to break my heart.
sophie," Oh, oh... I must say. I thought that one was bar - i'm just so shocked that she wasn't real well, she was real, I mean she was human, of course. but not our real. I must say, even my sisters were touched by her yes - yes they were..."
tatiana," No, Sophie. My heart can't take it anymore! I will see no more girls claiming to be Anastasia."
dmitri,Hurry up with those papers.
vladimir,Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
dmitri," ""Wake up, your highness"" - we should start getting used to saying it."
vladimir,"What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness""."
dmitri, Wake up!
vladimer,We have a lot of work to do...
dmitri,Come on!
dmitri,Take my hand!
dmitri,Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
anya,Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
dmitri,I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
anya,By pulling my hair?!
dmitri,I was all out of dynamite!
anya," Put it on your nose. For heaven's sake, you're making such a fuss!"
anya, Men are such babies...
anya,"Here, let me"
dmitri,You're a princess...
vladimir,Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
vladimir,"Well, she certainly has a mind of her own."
dmitri,Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
guard,Papers!
vladimir, It's what I hate about this government - everything in red!
guard,"Thank you, Comrade Zhivago."
zhivago,Doctor Zhivago.
vladimir,What do we do now?
dmitri,Pray he's color-blind...
guard,wait here.
anya,I'm going to stretch my legs
dmitri,That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
anya, I must have hit him harder than I thought...
guard,That's them! Come on!
dmitri,Wait here!
anya, Would you like to tell what we are...
dmitri,Come on up!
anya,Why?
anya,Just what do you think you're doing?!
dmitri,Trying... to... breathe...
dmitri,The guards!  I'll explain later.
anya,"Forged papers! Now, what?!"
dmitri,Now just get off the train.
anya,HUH?!
anya,Noooo....
vladimir,"She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to"
dmitri,"Come on, we'll jump together... Take my hand."
dmitri,Come on!
anya,No!
vladimir,I think I have hurt my...
dmitri,You must enjoy causing me pain!
anya,You shouldn't have pushed us!
vladimir,Is everyone all right?
anya,I'm fine.
dmitri,"She's fine!  I may never walk right again, but she's fine..."
bartok,"Well, I better got goin'. Got a busy day letting all the blood rush to my head..."
rasputin,"She's too far away, isn't she?"
bartok,"Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that."
rasputin,We'll catch her and finish her!  We ride this night!
bartok,"Well,    we wait this night!"
vladimir,"No have a lot of work to do, Anya! Come along, Meetoo!"
anya,Who's Sophie?
vladimir," Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean."
anya,What?!
dmitri,You are the Princess.
vladimir,We're just going to refresh your memory...
anya,I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
dmitri,What do you see?
vladimir,Ah! Let us begin!
anya,"...and on my father's side, there was [THIS SECTION IS NOT LEDGABLE]"
dmitri,Every Russian family has one..
anya, Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
vladimir,Did I tell you that?
anya,You must have.
anya, [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
dmitri, It's the best fork of all
anya,The dessert fork!
vladimir," Ah, yes ... I have always loved that fork..."
anya,What a beautiful ship!
dmitri,It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
vladimir,"Oh, yes it was the seagoing vessel of elaborate elegance in entertaining...  A party boat. It once belonged to ..."
anya,Konstantin Petrovich of Moscow!
elderly dowager,"No, no, boys! You don't know where he's been!"
vladimir,Come out! I can do alterations.
vladimir,I shant!
dmitri,I won't laugh - I swear...
anya,You said you wouldn't laugh!
dmitri,It's not you - it's the dress!
anya, I'm never going to be..
vladimir,You are a natural! I don't know how you ever learned to dance that well! That must have been some high class orphanage ...
dmitri,I wanted to show you something.
anya,It's so beautiful ... and sad.
dmitri,Sad?
anya,Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
dmitri,"Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?"
anya,I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
dmitri,"Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost."
anya,I'm sorry.
dmitri, Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
rasputin, She's out there ...
bartok,I'm getting a chest cold..
rasputin,Bartok... a question.
bartok,I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
rasputin,What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
bartok,"My cousin Mischa, nice fellow had some dental problems - you didn't want to watch him eat, let's put it that way..."
bartok,"... anyway, a bunch of other bats were hanging in the belfry - I know, cliche, but there you have it, and Mischa, not the brightest bat in the world, decides to hang in the bell. Which was fine for awhile until it started ringing ...  Ewwww, what a mess ..."
rasputtn, Show her to me ...
bartok,"And it didn't help the tonal quality of the bell, either."
dmitri,If you have to go - wake her..
dmitri,What were you doing?!
bartok,"Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?"
rasputin," She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him."
bartok,"Nice looking fellow. I mean, don't get me wrong - I'm not attracted to him in the physical sense, I just ..."
rasputin,"You are toying with me, aren't you? You let me get so close..."
bartok,Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
rasputin,"We are going to Paris - and while we're there, let's kill the young man. He annoys me."
anya,Oh! I'm sorry...
dmitri,It's okay. Didn't hurt..
anya, I'm almost there... I'm finally going to know...
dmitri,How is our current financial status?
vladimir,"If I used the word ""bleak"" I would be optimistic."
dmitri,It worked in Odessa...
elderly dowager,"Help! My little dogs! Chevalier! Maurice! Hold on, darlings!"
dmitri,"I'll save them, Madame"
vladimir,"Such bravery! Why, that man should be rewarded! Amply rewarded!"
anya,That was really very kind of you.
vladimir,I won't say a word...
dmitri,Nervous?
anya,"Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana...."
dmitri,You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
vladimir,May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
sophie,Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
sophie,"I'd just like to ask you a few questions, dear..."
anya,Of course.
sophie,Where were you born?
sophie, This is the hard one ... what rare treat was served on the night of the Three Hundredth Anniversary of the Romanov Dynasty? The last ball they ever had?
anya,Father had fresh tropical fruits sent in. Oranges and pineapples from the far east. I remember ... I remember I threw an orange to a young boy who was hiding under a table...
sophie," Yes ... yes, it was fresh fruit. Well, maybe not ""fresh"" Estelle got one rather brown banana but ..."
vladimir,Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
sophie,"Oh, heavens - I must say, yes."
vladimir,"Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?"
sophie,"Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls."
vladimir,Perhaps you could convince her?
sophie,"Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect."
sophie,"Come my dear, we've much to talk about."
vladimir,"We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!"
dmitri,"But it's not    the money, Vlad."
vladimir, Are you feeling all right?
vladimir,"Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her."
dmitri,What do you mean?
vladimir,"Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner."
accordion player,Lovers!
flower seller,Ooh la la!
bartok, PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
bartok,"Sorry, it's just... you know I saw these french postcards once and... ooh la la ... well, I'm not sure about the ""ooh"", but it's the ""la la"" I'm really lookin' forward to...  Right, I'm shutting up."
rasputin,"We're close to her, aren't we?"
bartok,What do you think? Is it me?
vladimir,Compliments of Sophie. Her escort has to look his best.
anya,How do I look?
dmitri,Look. There is your grandmother...
anya,She's so beautiful! I do remember her ... I remember her ...
dmitri,Come on. It's time..
anya,I'm so scared...
dmitri,Don't be
dmitri, I know.
dmitri,I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
dmitri,"Please, if you'd just listen..."
tatiana, Remove him at once.
dmitri,Please! Empress! It's not what you ....
dmitri,Anya. . . please. . .
dmitri,"Anya, wait!"
anya, Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
dmitri,"No! Well, yes, but"
anya,No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
dmitri,Sir! Your rear tire is flat!
chauffeur,it is?
tatiana,Ulo! Slow down!
dmitri,I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
tatiana, You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
tatiana,Stop this car!
dmitri,"Please don't be afraid! I'm sorry, but there was no other way!"
tatiana,Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
dmitri,What I foundyour was your granddaughter!
anya,Go away!
tatiana,"Who are you, child?"
anya, I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
tatiana,Do you remember this?
anya,"I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ..."
tatiana,Oh! Where did you get that?!
anya,I've always had it... I came here because of this! Tell me if you recognize it! Please! It's all I have...
tatiana," If this is part of your scheme! If you found it or stole - I don't care, I'll give you whatever you want just TELL ME THE TRUTH!"

bartok,I should have been a dentist ...
anya,"... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything."
tatiana,"Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home..."
rasputin,"Yesss ... finally ""home"". And what a charming ... girlish little home it is.  Look, Bartok, little angels, the symbol of ... love. So sweet, so harmless."
tatiana,"Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear..."
anya," No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think..."
tatiana," No, no child... shush... it's all right ..."
sophie,"A grand ball for the Princess. How very exciting. So much to do, so little time..."
tatiana," Do it somewhere else, please. Quietly."
sophie,Caterers ... invitations ... saber dancers! We must have saber dancers!
pierre,Her head it is ... how you say?
andre,Beeg. Zat is how you say it. Beeg.
pierre,And the crown she is ... how you say?
andre,"Small! Zat is ""how you say"" it! Don't be so French, Pierre wit the ""how you say"" all za time - zat is really annoying."
tatiana,You are going to make a beautiful princess.
tatiana,"Lovely...  What troubles you, child?"
vladimir,"Madame, your... eh... guest has arrived."
tatiana," Thank you, Vladimir.,"
vladimir,Anya... Anastasia... I'm sorry ... We didn't mean to hurt you ...
tatiana,I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
dmitri,"No. Empress, you --"
tatiana,I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
dmitri,"Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry..."
tatiana,"Young    man, I..."
dmitri,"... and I'm going to keep my promise to stay out of your lives, forever."
tatiana,You are the boy ...
dmitri, I should go
tatiana,"That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?"
dmitri,Promise me she'll have her home.
tatiana,She does.
dmitri,And tell me that she's happy.
tatiana,"Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could."
dmitri,I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
anya,I'm glad you    did too.
anya,Enjoy your fortune.
vladimir,But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
dmitri,Watch me.
vladimir,So where will you go?
dmitri,She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
rasputin,"So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?"
dmitri, Rasputin!
rasputin,"I know, I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be."
dmitri,What do you want?!
rasputin,"The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia..."
dmitri,You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
rasputin,STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
major domo,"... then as I say ""Her Serene Highness Princess Anastasia"" you, your Highness, should walk out on to the stage and greet your ..."
tatiana,I believe her highness understands what she has to do.
anya,"Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear..."
tatiana,"No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make."
anya,There's no choice...
vladimir," Your ""guest"" is unable to attend."
anya,"Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!"
vladimir," Yes, your highness."
anya,Poor Meetoo!
vladimir," Yes, your highness."
anya,"Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money."
tatiana,"But they didn't take the money - either one of them. I offered it to them, but they both refused."
anya,Dmitri didn't want the money?
tatiana,"No, he just wanted to know you were happy."
vladimir," With your highness, permission."
anya,"Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!"
vladimir,No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
anya,Why does everyone have to act that way?
tatiana,"You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown..."
anya,"""If"" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!"
tatiana,Is it? Is this what you want?
anya,"I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you."
tatiana,"You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself."
anya,And this is my future. This is who I am!
tatiana,This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
anya,I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
tatiana,"Yes, you do. You do."
anya,I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
tatiana,"And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home."
rasputin,"Look, Bartok. Most of them were there the night I made this curse. Now, they'll get to see it finished!  Revenge is a dish best served... in front of a larrrrrge audience!"
bartok," Ahh, very witty. There's this English guy - Noel Coward - I'll bet he's quaking ..."
anya,Dmitri?
anya,Dmitri ... Grandmama told me.
anya,"Dmitri, what's wrong?"
rasputin, Throw her off the edge! Do it!
anya,Dmitri ... Look at me! It's Anya! It's ANYA!
anya,You saved my life in the palace! You won't take it now...
rasputin, FINISH HER!
anya,Dmitri. I know you would never hurt me. You love me.
anya,Dmitri?
dmitri,Anya... where are we?
anya,I guess you aren't as powerful as you thought!
rasputin,I'll show you!
dmitri,"Run, Anya -  go..."
anya,I'm not leaving you!
rasputin,Fighting for fair lady. How noble...
dmitri,Anya!
rasputin,"My curse is now complete! Good-bye, babushka!"
dmitri,Take my hand!  Hurry!
anya,Don't let me go!
dmitri,I'll never let go!
rasputin,This little piggy had a palace... this little piggy had a throne...
dmitri,Come on... I'll take you home.
anya,I am home.
