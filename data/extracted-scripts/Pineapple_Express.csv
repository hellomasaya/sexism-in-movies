Speaker,Dialogue
general brat,When did it start?
scientist," Private Miller, we are now going to ask you several questions. How do you feel?"
private miller,"Uh, I feel a little queer sir. But... It's good. Good queer.  Sir. Good queer, Sir."
scientist,"Private Miller. When you think of your superiors, what emotions do you feel?"
private miller, This went out...Sir.
scientist,We will send someone in. Now answer the question.
private miller,Oh...um...what was the question again?
private miller,"COUGH   COUGH  Fucking shit.  Well, now that I think of it, it's strange that they are called my `superiors'. Does that make me their `inferior'? I mean, that's pretty fucked up."
general brat," I've seen enough. Shut it down. Bury the hatch, sell the land, and dispose of him. This never happened."
private miller, Sir!!! Sir!!! Help me!!!
general, Illegal.
dale,You're Joshua Aaron Corber?
dale,"Sorry, but you've been served."
dale, Hey! Nice. New chicken fries.
dale,Yo. It's Dale. Mind if I come by and pick up some shit?
dale,"What's up, Saul."
saul, What the fuck?!?
dale,What?
saul,I didn't buzz you in. How the monkey did you get in here?
dale,"Whoa...sorry, man. someone just let me in. I-"
saul,"That's fucked up, man! This building is filled with fuckin' assholes. What else is the buzzer for? Fuck."
dale,"I'll buzz next time, man. I'm real sorry. I'm just not familiar with your, uh...protocol yet."
saul,"Hey, stuff your sorry's i n a sack, bro. We're always cool. It's those fuckin' jaggoffs."
dale,Um...sure.
saul,"Brass tacs. I've got this new bud. Unfortunately, it's a few more bones, but fortunately, it's hands down the dopest fuckin' shit I ever smoked. And I've smoked some dope fuckin' shit."
dale,Better than that Blue Oyster weed?
saul,"Dude. Seriously. It's like if that Blue Oyster shit and the Afghan Kush I got had a baby, and meanwhile, the craziest Northern Lights and that red-ass Espresso Snowflake had a baby, and then by some miracle those babies met, and fucked - then this would be the shit they'd birth."
dale,What is this? It's spectacular.
saul,"It's called Pineapple Express. My guy Red told me it's when this Hawaiian flood takes special dirt to the weed or some shit. It's pretty scientific. And I'm the only guy in the whole city who has it. And, its only ten bones more for a quarter."
dale,So...can I get a quarter?
saul,No doubt. Just let me grab my scale.
dale,Where's the scale?
saul,Oh shit! The scale. Be right back.
dale,Holy shit! What the fuck is this thing?
saul," Ah, the cross-joint. You've never seen one of these? Not surprising. They are, like, the apex of the vortex of joint engineering. NASA built the first one in the eighties."
dale,You can actually smoke that contraption?
saul,"You light all three ends at the same time, then, you smoke it as it resonates the main section, creating a ""trifecta"" of smoking power. It's like, three times as powerful as a normal joint."
dale,"Well, be careful with that thing."
saul,Dude...you wanna smoke this thing with me?
dale," Wow. So like, uh...so like, so like what do I do?"
saul,"Alright. Firstly you light these two ends. Then I will light the tip, making the trifecta complete. Are you ready?"
dale,Holy...
saul,"It's...uh, it's good to cough.  COUGH  It opens the  COUGH  capillaries...gets you twenty-five percent higher. "
dale,I'm a process server.
saul,"You`re a servant? Like, a butler."
dale,"No, process server."
saul,"Nice, man. Where'd you get that job?"
dale,"Well...uh, I got a totally useless degree two years ago, then I did nothing for a year, then my dad got so fed up he hooked me up."
saul,"Hey man, did you get those new chicken fries?"
dale,"Yeah man. I'd get on that shit. They're fucking mind blowing. So, then I hot- boxed my car and then...got some action from my girlfriend."
saul,Does she smoke pot?
dale,A little. She's in high school.
saul,That's fuckin' sweet! Ilegal love! You're like Jerry Lee Lewis. I just read his biography.
dale,Sorry to hear that.
saul,"Yo, so, like, what have these people done that you go after?"
dale,Let's see...tonight I'm going after-
saul,"Dude! My guy, Red, gets his weed from a Ted Jones. He's, like, #1 supplier in town. Maybe it's him!"
dale,"I doubt that, man. There's probably a lot of Ted Joneses's out there."
saul,"Yeah, but not like this one, man! He's what I want to be one day. He's like the ""Jesus of Weed"". So...I guess he's like Jah. Or Scarface."
dale,"Well Saul, that was crazy. Thanks."
saul,"No worries dude, peace."
ted,Pineapple Express.
saul,Ha! Ha! Ha! Screech.
saul, Denton? Dale Denton?
saul," ...fucking, don't smoke that shit if you can't handle it."
dale,"He fucking killed him, man!"
saul,"Be quiet, man, I got neighbors-"
dale, He killed him!
saul, Somebody killed somebody?!?
dale,"Yeah, man! I can't believe it. A cop! A lady, and a guy."
saul,"Somebody killed a cop, a lady and a guy?"
dale,No! A guy!
saul,A cop killed a guy?
dale,"No! A cop and a guy killed   another guy! The lady and the guy...No,   a fucking woman, a police woman, and   an old guy, shot a guy, a younger guy,   in the fucking window at Ted's house!"
saul,Was the guy Ted?
dale,Which guy?
saul,"I don't know, the old guy who shot the guy?"
dale,"I don't fucking know. He was this big, old, grey haired guy with a gun, and he fucking took him, and he shot him! Right there in the fucking window! BAM!"
saul,I heard Ted's got grey hair!
dale,And they saw me! They saw me see them shoot the guy!
saul,What!?! They saw you?!? Why the fuck did you come here? Did they follow you?!?
dale,"No! I panicked. I was having a coughing fit, I crashed, I crashed into a car. Fuck, two cars. They must've heard at least. They knew someone was there."
saul,But they don't know it's you?
dale,No. I don't think so. No.
saul,So...they're not coming here?
dale,I'm not calling the cops - one of them was a cop. They could all be cops!
saul,Did you see any blood? Was it sick?
dale,Yeah. I saw some blood.
saul,I wonder who the guy he shot was?
dale,"I don't know, who do drug dealers kill? It was probably another drug dealer. He was Asian. Are there Asian drug dealers."
saul,"Hell yeah, man. The Koreans teamed up with, like, the Vietnamese or some shit. They're crazy mother fuckers. Number two in town.  Heh. Ted's cappin' the competition. Yo, you want some of this?"
saul,"Oh, the Pineapple Express. It's so rare it's almost a shame to smoke it, like killing a unicorn...with, like, a bomb."
dale,When I threw it...out...the window...
saul,What?
dale,This weed is actually that rare?
saul," Yeah, it's like, ""the rarest""."
dale,"So, you are actually the only guy in town with this weed?"
saul,"Fuckin' rights, I am. Red told me he was giving me an ""exclusive sneak preview""."
dale,And am I the only guy you gave it to?
saul,"Yeah. So, we're the only guys."
dale,"But, like, another dealer, couldn't identify it, the pineapple weed? Like, if they found a roach of it, right?"
saul,I could. Why?
dale," We should go, we shouldn't be here! We should go!"
saul,"No...seriously, why?"
dale,I left a roach of this weed in front of Ted's house!
saul,So what? I leave roaches all over fucking town.
dale,"No, listen - they could find the roach and say, ""This is pineapple weed, Saul's the only guy in town who has pineapple weed, therefore he must have witnessed the murder or know who did - let's go kill him."""
saul,Mother of fuck!
dale,Wait!
saul,Why!?! Let go of me! Let's get the fuck out of here!
dale,"Saul, wait! Grab anything we might need, like your weed and money and stuff."
saul,Yes! Come on!
saul,Fuck! I forgot something!
dale,"We'll take the stairs, it'll be faster."
saul,Why?!?
dale,We don't want to draw attention.
saul, Whose attention!?! You think they could be down there? In the Lobby? Right now!?!
dale,I don't know! Who knows? Just try to be cool.
saul,What the fuck was that?
dale,That was bad - Calm! Calm! Calm!
dale,"Okay, what do you know about Ted?"
saul,"What? Ted? Nothing. For all I know he's tracking us with space satellites right now! He's got grey hair, that's all I knew."
dale,No way! What if they did see my license plate!?!
saul,"Okay, so let's got to a hotel, or a motel, or a Holiday Inn."
dale,"Well, how much money do we have?"
saul,All I've got is the seventy-five you gave me.
dale,That's it!?!
saul,"Well, how much money do you have?"
dale,Uh...nine bucks.
saul,"Well, shut up then! I've got more than you!"
dale,Fine. Forget the hotel.
saul,I wish we could just go nowhere.
dale,Okay...where's nowhere?
dale,"So what do we know? Nothing. We may or may not be followed because we don't even know if he found the roach or not. And, we could just be completely crazy. But, the question is this: even if he found the roach, how could he know where you were?"
saul," He couldn't. Cause I'm in the woods. It's impossible! Unless he's, like, hanging on the bottom of the car or some shit, but I mean-"
dale,"No, what I mean is, if Ted found the roach and identified the weed, how could he connect it to you?"
saul,There's no way. He could only find out from Red.
dale,Who is this Red guy?
saul,"Red's pretty much a middleman between Ted and guys like me. And we're mad fucking tight. One time he convinced some girl he knew to give me a hand-job within, like, five minutes of me meeting her."
dale,"But let's say someone calls asking who he sold this pineapple weed to, he'll say you, because...why wouldn't he?"
saul,"Fuck that. That's bullshit. He would have called me if that happened. A hand-job, Dale! Imagine if I'd gotten you a hand job by now!"
dale,"You're right. You are. I'm just being paranoid. Sorry, dude."
saul,"Yo, Red. You okay man?"
saul,"Dude, watch the toes. Wear shoes in the house. But Red, I gotta get straight to brass tacs, I need a favor."
saul,"You sure as fuck are, buddy. So, you know how you gave me some of that pineapple express stuff? Don't tell anyone you gave it to me."
saul,"So, can I come on over now?"
dale, No! We should do it tomorrow!
saul," I'm in the middle of a convo, man. Let's just go and get this shit over with."
dale,"Come on, man. Tomorrow. I'm scared shitless. I want to think things through before I do anything. Let's go in the morning. Please."
saul,Yeah...okay. Less scary shit happens in the day.
saul,"Yeah, right after I see my grandma."
saul,"Yeah man. I've only got one. So, we'll be chillin' by noon."
saul,We should definitely hit up the casino again sometime.
saul,"Nice. Now let's do some fucking stone cold chilling. I'll role a jigga, on the house."
red," I didn't say shit, man! There was another guy there and he said tomorrow!"
red,"No, man!"
saul,I always liked smoking weed in the forest.
dale,I'm going to go call Angie. Make up some bull shit.
saul,Dale...wait!
dale,What the fuck is that?!
saul,It's them!!!
dale, You know what? You're right. We should just get rid of them. We should just smash `em.
saul,No! Smash it!
dale,What the fuck was that?!
saul,Fuck! I was trying to throw it at that tree!
dale,What tree?
saul,That one.
dale,Who the fuck knows?!? I don't know!! Why couldn't you have just smashed it on a rock like a normal person?
saul,I was trying to smash it! How often does a guy smash things? I'm rusty. Fuck.
dale,Did you at least see where it landed?
saul,"Over there, somewhere. Wait! We could call it!"
dale,With what? I just smashed my phone!
saul,"Man, it's not like they got McGuyver workin' on the case. I bet they can't even triangulate it."
dale,"Well, then you shouldn't have said anything, cause now you've convinced me that they can!"
saul,Fine! Fine. Let's just find the stupid thing and get back to doing what we were doin'.
dale,Do you see it?
saul,"Dude, this is the scariest place I've ever been in my life."
dale,"The ""Blair Witch Project."""
saul,No...Shit. That one's way scarier than the one I was thinking of. Mine had Arnold Shwartzenegger in it. Now I'm thinking of the fucking Blair Witch.
dale, Stop!
saul, What-
dale, Sshh!
saul, What is-
dale, Sshh! Can you hear that?
saul, What?
dale, Just listen.
saul, Wait...
dale,SAUL!!!
dale,Shit.
saul, Let me in! Let me in!
dale,Is there anyone even out there?!?
saul,I don't know!
dale,If you don't know then why the hell did you run like that?!?
saul,"I don't know! I'm freaking out, man! Let's just go!"
radio dj,"-white accent walls would go nice with a dark colored room, say a burnt sienna, but don't forget..."
saul,Talk radio? You fuckin' joshin' me? Why don't we just shoot ourselves in the nuts?
dale,"Shut up, okay? It's my car."
saul,"Fine. Well, I'm going to smoke a joint before I go to sleep, and don't worry about it, even though you're being a dick, it's on the house."
dale,Saul. Saul. Get up. Wake up.
saul,Fuck me.
dale,What's the time?
saul, It's too early.
dale,What does it say?
saul,"It says, uh..."
dale,It's three o'clock!?! We were supposed to be there at noon!
saul, Fuck! No! They go forwards an hour! Dammit-
dale,It's four o'fucking clock?!
saul,-I didn't go to my Grandma's! Fuck! And we've gotta call Red.
dale, How?
saul,We'll find a pay pho...fuck! His number was in my phone!
dale,"You remember where he lives, right?"
saul,"Yes, I remember. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Are you insinuating I'm forgetful? That's right, I know the word insinuating."
dale,Let's just get out of here.
saul,Are you fucking serious?
dale,It's dead.
saul,It's dead?
dale,How? We fell asleep!
dale,We gotta...let's just...we'll walk. We'll walk to a road and hitchhike to Red's.
saul,For real?
dale,"Yeah, ""for real"". We'll be late, but we'll get there. Then we can fix this insane situation."
saul,"It's like, my thumb is my cock!"
saul," Thanks a fucking ton, Sharid."
dale,"So, what's this guy like?"
saul,I don't know. He's short...and stout. So he's like a tea pot. Hehe.
dale,"Well, do you think he'll be there?"
saul,"I don't know, I mean, we are only...eight hours late.  That's actually pretty late."
saul,Red! It's Saul. Open up.
red, Who's this guy?
dale,Dale. Nice to meet you.
red,Dale who?
dale,I think it's    better if you don't know my last-
saul, Dale Denton. He's with me. No worries.
red," What happened to your clothes? Where'd you call me from, man?"
saul,We were in the forest laying low. Thinking.
dale,"Uh, Red...what...uh, is your lip okay?"
saul,"Whoa! Dude, have you been crying?"
red,"What? Oh, I uh...  ...I got a cold sore, I've never got one before. I started crying."
saul,A cold sore? Is that fucking herpes?
red,"...uh, yeah, man."
saul,"Ewwww! That's sick, man. Do you know how many joints we've shared? I told you, man. This is from that time you ate the lollypop straight from the strippers sna-"
dale,Saul. Ask him.
saul," Okay, Captain Demando. Can you just chill out, maybe? So, Red. I gotta ask-"
red,"Okay, first of all, stop. What's this all about? That's what I want to know."
saul,"Alright. Well, Dale's a servant for protest lawyers, and-"
dale,"Whoa, whoa! Saul, I don't think...well, Red, I don't mean to be rude but I don't think we should tell you any more than you need to know."
red,"Fuck that, Dale. This is my house, I deserve to know."
saul,Dude! Let's just tell him. It is his house.
dale,"Look. Red, I just don't want to pull you into the shit we're in. It's just trouble."
saul,"Don't be weird about this. If he wants trouble, it's his right to have it."
red,Whoa! Whoa! I don't want trouble.
dale,That's why we only need to clarify one thing - nobody's called about Saul or the pineapple express or anything like that?
red,No one. Nada.
saul,"Awesome! Look at that! Everything's fine. We had a crazy night in the woods, which I assume we can both put behind us like grown ups, and now we can use Red's giant bong to get super-duper high."
dale,I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
saul,Dale!   What the fuck are you doing?
dale, We can't let him call anyone! He's acting weird!
red,Fuck you man - this is my house!
dale,"I'm sorry. I just, I don't think I can-"
saul,"Dale! You fucking nut. You're stoned and paranoid. Just chill the shit out, guy!  I'm sorry, Red. I shouldn't have brought this guy over here, he's a total lunatic."
dale, AAAHHH!
saul,Holy cock!
dale, SAUL!!! Phone!!!
saul,What the fuck Red!?! What the fuck is going on!?!
red,I don't know!!! They're going to kill me!!!
saul,"You didn't stub your toe, did you?"
dale,Now tell us-
red,They're gonna come back and kill me!!!
dale,It's happening! It's actually happening! He knows my name! Red knows my name!
saul,"We should beat it out of his sellout brains. You're a shitty friend, Red! Fuck the Casino! Go alone!"
dale,"This is fucked, what do we do now, he knows my name!?!"
saul,He knows my name too!
dale,Well what do we do? He's gonna tell them!
saul,"We're not gonna have to kill him, are we? I don't think I could do that."
dale,"Well, we have to find out what he knows."
red, I don't know anything...you broke my bong...
dale,Tell us everything. Now!
saul,"Don't look at me, you sellout bastard. Now start talking!"
red,I can't...I don't know anything.
saul,What do we do? He's not gonna talk.
dale,I think we beat it out of him.
saul,For real?
dale,"Okay. Red. Here's the deal: if you don't tell us everything, we're going to beat you up."
red,"Don't beat me up! Saul, dude, I'm Red!"
dale,"You've got five seconds, okay? Ready? Five, four-"
red,Please don't.
dale,"Three, two...one!"
red,That didn't hurt.
saul,"You didn't even hurt him! Hit him hard, man. Like, fucking hit him!"
red,Wait! I...I...
saul,Seriously?
dale,Who were they?
red,"They work for Ted. Budlofsky and Matheson. Fuckin' crazy weird guys. They were here all day, but you guys didn't show. They said they'd kill me if I didn't bring you to them, they said I'd-"
dale,"How many cops does he have in his...uh, payroll, or whatever?"
red,"I know there's this lady cop. He could have more, I don't know. He's got pretty crazy connections. He's also got a cool- ass hideout. It's crazy man."
dale,Who's his competition?
red,The Asians!
dale,Asians? Which Asians? Indians are technically Asian.
red,"The...the Koreans, I think. Everyone just calls them the Asians."
saul,What else?
red,I swear to god that's all I know...I swear...
dale,Alright. We should...tie him up and...and get the fuck out of here.
saul,I made a gravity bong here once. I know where his duct tape is.
dale,What?
saul,"I can't find the, oh...wait..."
dale, What do we do?
saul, I don't know.
saul,In here!
dale,No. I've got to get to a phone!
saul,We should hide!
dale,"But, if Red tells Ted's guys my name, then they'll go to my apartment and find out about Angie!"
saul,I think we should stay!
dale,Why?!
saul,Because I'm in the dumpster already! Shit! Fine!
red,"I just did, Matheson. Fuckin' Dale Denton's the other guys name. He was with Saul, they kicked my ass. What more do you want?"
ted,Ask if either of them were Asian.
red,"What? Um...white, they're both white. I think Denton might be a Jew, but I couldn't really tell."
carol,Does he have something to do with our friend in there?
ted,"If the Asians have the balls to send an assassin right into my home, we can't be too cautious. The boys say Denton and Saul are Caucasian. Maybe after their assassin failed, they hired this outside guy Denton to finish the job.  Also, the boys said that Saul mentioned ""going to the casino."""
saul," But my parents live   in Canada. You don't think they're going   to go to Canada, do you? How would they   get a Canadian phone book even?"
dale," All I know is Angie's new number is on my fridge and they could see that, so I have to get to her."
dale,"Dude, stay here. I'll be back in a minute."
saul,Hells no! I don't want to be alone! I want to go with you!
dale,"Saul, just watch my back. I'll literally be five minutes. Please."
saul,Fine. But hurry.
dale,Angie!
angie,Who are these people? Why are they-
dale,I think their drug dealers.
angie, Why?
dale,"Well, it's complicated. See, the...uh...it doesn't matter right now, we just have to get out of here."
angie,Let's go to the police!
dale,"No, they are the police!"
saul, You... huff ...Angie? Dale! It's happening!
angie,EEEHHHH!!!
saul,ARGGG!!!
angie," Dale, it's one of the drug dealers!!!"
saul,"No! I'm Dale's dealer, I'm S-"
dale,Angie! Stop! It's Saul!
angie,"Saul? Dale, who is-"
saul,"Dale, they're coming!"
saul,Why aren't we in that car?
dale,"Let's run, man! Run!"
saul,Huff   Huff  Where are we running?
dale,Somewhere we can think.
carol,A fork?
ted,A bloody fork. In his girlfriends house. And the blood was fresh.
carol,"Maybe he killed her, to protect himself."
ted,Or maybe it's the Asians fucking with us. What the fuck is going on!  Any luck with the cell phones?
carol,"They smashed one and left the other one in the woods to distract us. Took us an hour to find it. And we found Denton's car, which was filled with all these strange disguises. These guys are for real."
ted,I want to talk to the Asians. Get me Cheung's number. Now.
cheung, Hello?
ted,Cheung. It's Ted.
cheung, Record this conversation.
ted,"Cheung, I want you to call off your man Denton. I don't know what he is, a scout, assassin, and frankly I don't care. I just want him gone. I want him dead. If you do this, I'll consider it a peace offering, otherwise, you're asking for war. And just in case you forgot, I'm number one, and there's a reason for that. You've got 24 hours to reply."
cheung,"Ted Jones is slipping. Our assassin failed to kill him, but it did rattle his confidence. It's earlier than planned, but we should strike now, while he is confused. Let it be known-"
saul,Victory joint complete. Here ya go.
dale,"""Tell us what you know!"" How fuckin' balls was that?"
saul,"Like, really balls."
dale,"And I think I fought pretty well, don't you? You know, for my first time. We were like Tango and Cash, man."
saul,Or Scarface!
dale,BOOM! Knocked the door right off it's hinges!
saul,"And you probably saved Angie, which is fucking pimp."
dale,"I probably couldn't have done it without you. Thanks, man. It is fucking pimp."
saul,"We're in this together, right? So, ya know."
dale,"Thanks, man.  You know, my last dealer was a total dick. You're by far the coolest dealer I've ever had."
saul," Wow. Thanks, man. I seriously appreciate that."
dale,"Yeah...like, the time before last time, I totally had weed. I just kind of wanted to chill with you."
saul," Really? That's awesome, man. That means a lot to me, `cause, like, plenty of dudes come in to buy and pretend to be all buddy-buddy with me, but in my head I'm always, like, ""you don't like me, you like my drugs, so fuck you, buddy!"" You know? And just so you know, I totally could have lit that cross-joint on my own. I'd just have to use candles, but, like, I've never smoked one of those with anyone before."
dale,"So, do you think we should leave town? We could just get on a bus and go, right?"
saul,"We only have, like, fifty bucks. I don't think that could even pay for one ticket."
dale,What about your sack?
saul,Oh man. It's still fucking killing me.
dale," No dude, your sack of weed. Can't we sell some?"
saul,"Of course. That's my bread and butter. We just have to go to a highschool. It's the easiest market. Chester A. Arthur is like, a block a way."
dale,"No way, man. I'm not going to sell to kids."
saul, We could go to Crackhead Park.
dale,What's that?
saul,"It's a park. Really close, actually. Full of crackheads. They smoke weed too, though."
saul,Yo. `sup. You guys want some chronic?
dale," Man, this is great."
ack,Cough   Cough  What's it called again?
walt,"Pineapple express. They said it, like, eight times, you fucking `tard."
ack,"Oh, so sorry if I-"
blake,"Come on, man. Puff, puff, pass."
saul,"You know, I went here for a year. Kicked me out for having a swiss army knife. Everyone has a swiss army knife!"
dale,"I got like, thirty for my Bar Mitzvah."
desmond,My Bar Mitzvah sucked.
ack,I touched Jessica Lubell's tit at your Bar Mitzvah.
dale,You touched a tit when you were twelve?
walt,Lubell? Are you joking? Those are the finest tats in the grade!
blake,A hundred and seventy eight.
saul,"Alright. You gimme all your money, you can each take two handfuls of weed. That treat ya right?"
desmond,That's fucking awesome!
saul,I know. Keep it on the down low.
ack, Jason'll never believe this...until I show him all this weed!
saul,"And we, my good man, are officially scott fuckin' free."
dale,There are still people trying to kill us.
saul,But at least now we can afford to run. I'm gonna go buy some celebration snacks. Let's have us a little mardi-gras fiesta.
police liaison,Don't move!
police liaison,"Selling pot to my students isn't ""decriminalized."" I'm the liaison officer for this school and I just caught four students showing off handfuls of marijuana to their friends. They told me they got it back here. Put your hands up."
dale,Wait! I wasn't selling anything! All I have is this little joint.
police liaison,You call this little?
dale,I don't even have any money! How did I sell weed if I don't have any money?!? I was just smoking it. I swear. Please.
police liaison,"It's possible you're telling the truth. I'm going to run a check and if it turns out you don't have any priors and all you've got is this small amount of marijuana, I'll let you go with a fine. Take a seat."
saul,"They got Dale. Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck..."
carol, Denton.
dale,What is this for? What did that thing tell you? What did I do?
police liaison,"Hit and run, Mr. Denton. A double, actually. You hit two parked cars two nights ago."
saul,The lady cop. She's gonna kill him.
dale,You don't understand! You have to let me go! Dirty cops are gonna kill me! Please!
police liaison, Ted Jones?
dale,Yeah. With grey-hair. Tell me you know what I'm talking about. He lives near Evergreen Heights. He-
police liaison,Are you telling me you saw Ted Jones and a police office shoot someone?
dale,Yeah. An Asian someone.
police liaison,"Stay calm, do as your told, I'll get you down to the station."
dale, Yes ma'am.
police liaison,Oh my god! Is that blood? Oh my god!
dale,NO! What are you doing!?!
saul,"Saving you. Hold on, amigo. Tango and Cash!"
police liaison,Freeze mister! Don't even...
dale,No! She was going to help us!
saul, Oh...my balls...I seriously think I popped one...
dale, IT'S HER! The lady cop!
saul, Then who's that?
saul,The slurpee! I can't see!
dale,Turn on the wipers!
saul,"Dude, I seriously can't see!"
dale,Kick out the window! Isn't that what they do?
saul,I don't know. Okay.
dale,Get it out of there!
saul,Ah! Ah! My leg!
dale, She's following us! She's gaining on us!
saul,Her car's better!
dale,Do something!
saul,Hold on. I've got an idea.
dale,WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!?!?
saul,"Oh shit, man! I'm sorry! I thought she'd keep going."
dale,Turn on the sirens!
saul,Run!
dale,Saul! Saul! I'm locked in!
saul,So... huff ... huff ...fuckin' sorry... huff ...forgot...
dale,"Don't touch me, you asshole!"
saul,A thank you would be nice!
dale,"Could I have the, uh, Carlyle room, please?"
angie,Dale?
dale,Angie! Thank god you're okay!
angie,I'm fine. How are you? Are you okay?
dale,"I'm great. I'm fine. I miss you. So, here's the plan, babe. I'm going to leave town and contact a government official or something. From somewhere safe. I know this shit is all fucked up and I just can't apologize enough."
angie,Dale. I've realized some problems and-
dale,"I know there's a problem! That's the thing, that's why I-"
angie,"Dale, shut up and listen. People are trying to kill you, and me! Dale, drug dealers are trying to kill me, because of you! It's fucking over, man. Are you kidding me? For gods sake..."
dale,What? You're telling me you think I'm a dumb guy?
dale,Are you joking? You're actually gonna smoke marijuana?
saul,Why not?
dale,How can you smoke marijuana after what we just went through? That clearly happened because we were smoking marijuana.
saul,"No. It happened because those fucking kids didn't keep that shit on the down low. Which is weird, `cause they really seemed like cool kids."
dale,"If you haven't noticed, we're not very functional when we're stoned, Saul."
saul,When I saved you with those Slurpees I was stoned. What do you gotta say to that? Maybe the pot is what gave me the creative capacity to come up with such a great plan! The Beatles were high!
dale,"You didn't save me! She was going to protect us, and now we're wanted for all sorts of crazy shit!"
saul,"For one thing, I'm done dealing pot. Mostly, because I don't know where I would get it now, but still. And ""b"", fuck you, man. You can't judge me. We're exactly the same, and this whole thing's your fucking fault. You're the one who dropped the roach!"
dale,It's not my fault!
saul,Stop calling it marijuana!
carol,Guy drove like a mother-fucker. It was amazing.
ted,This is not good. We should have this under control. We haven't heard shit from the Asians. Got these lunatics after us. Shit.
carol,We should probably get to the farm.
saul,Hey! Mrs. Mendelson!
saul,Mrs. Corber! You gotta hide me!
saul,"Dale!?! What the fuck? Did you rat me out, you shitty bastard? That what happened?"
dale,No! I came here to save you!
saul,"To save me? Ha! That's rich! You're caught, too. And now I have to die with some asshole."
dale,"Saul, I deserved that, because I fucked you. You're right, this whole things my fault, and they only way I can make it up to you is by rescuing you, and that's why I'm here. To save my friend."
saul,"Tell ya what, Dale. You actually save me and I'll consider forgiving you for this mad shit."
saul,"Oh really? What, you forget to tell me you shoot lasers out of your eyes, or you got some kind of secret blowtorch strapped to your dick? We're not gonna escape, Dale, we're losers, and sinners, and after we die, we're gonna go to hell!"
dale,"We're not losers! We did that car chase. That was all you, man! You got away from the cops. I've watched, like, nine billion hours of worlds wildest police chases and I've never seen a guy get away. Not once! But you did it. You did the impossible."
ted,You have them?
carol,Where did you find them?
ted,He shot Frank? Jesus. Fuckin' Frank.
carol,Who the fuck is this Dale Denton?
dale,This isn't working. Turn around. I'm using my mouth.
saul, Someone's coming!
dale," Yo - if I cough, I'm going to make a move, if I cough twice, you take the lead. Got it?"
saul, What? No! What if you actually cough?
saul,"Holy shit, man! I'm sorry!"
ted,Has anyone seen my bigger knife?  Do you guys hear that?
saul,Dale? You're alive!
dale,What happened?
saul,They got your ear.
dale, My what?
saul,Here. Get up.
dale, AAHHHH!!! MY EAR!!!
saul," Well, you kneed my balls!"
dale,You shot him?
carol,On three.
saul,"Look at all this fucking weed, man. Where the hell are we? Is this some underground weed city we don't know about?"
dale, I don't know! That guy just blew half my fucking ear off!
saul, There's some dudes in here. I saw them when I got dragged down. And there's some kind of super-suit or something.
saul,You could boost me up! We'll sneak out.
saul,Wha-
ted,Denton!!!
saul,AHHH!!!
saul,Fuck...
dale,"Sorry, Ted..."
saul, Cough   Cough  What the fuck happened?
dale,We... Cough ...we did it. We beat them. We won.
saul,No fucking way. Seriously?  How did that happen?
dale,I have absolutely no idea.
saul,"They were fighting Asian dudes, man."
dale,"Asian dudes? So, okay...maybe this is revenge for that Asian dude I saw Ted kill."
dale,"I've gotta get downtown, try and win Angie back."
saul,"Tell her you cut off your ear for her, like that crazy artist.  But, seriously dude, your joking right? She'll never take you back, ever. Just grow up and date a woman your own age."
dale,"Do you think we should have looked for the ear? They probably could've re- attached it, eh? I mean, this ear thing kind of fucking sucks."
saul,"Don't worry, man. Look at Evander Holyfield, he looks totally normal. And plus, I saw this thing on the Discovery Channel, they can actually grow ears, like, in a petri dish, or even on the side of a mouse. And you only need half of one. It'll be a fuckin' cinch."
dale,I just realized I've 100% lost my job by now. I haven't called in for days.
saul,"Who fuckin' cares? I thought you wanted to be a talk radio dude anyways? And, like, I never said anything, but you do have the voice. Like, when I didn't know what you did, I kind of thought you might have been doing cartoon voices, you know, like that Shrek shit, and that's why you wore a suit."
saul,Do you hear something?
dale,All I hear is ringing.
saul,"Dude, I'm kind of freakin' out. Like...I don't know...like, there might be someone out there. I mean...how do we know we got them all?"
dale,"Well...the barn did collapse in a ball of fire, and we probably each inhaled about ten pounds of weed smoke, so...it's just, you know-"
saul, Stop!
dale, What-
saul, Sshh! Can you hear that?
dale, What?
saul, Just listen.
dale, I literally only hear ringing.
saul,Wait! Me too!
