doctor,Where's the crash cart!?
little girl,It's right there.
young steven,It's really big.
steven's mom,Are you a happy little boy Steven?
steven's brother,You're adopted.
young steven,Shut up!
steven's mom,It's true.
steven's dad,Your Mother's right. It's cause we love you. So we put some money in a brown paper bag and gave it to your real mom in the hospital parking lot so you could come home with us. Okay?
steven's mom,It doesn't change a thing honey. We love you just as much as we love your brother here...  ...and he's natural.
steven's dad,"So son, are you okay?"
young steven,Yes Daddy.
mandi,"Virginia Beach Police Department, how may I direct your call?"
steven,Hey fellas.
various policeman,"Hey Steve, Steve, mornin', etc..."
steven,Have lots of dreams...
stephanie, Okay.
debbie,"...and if it wasn't for you Jesus, I would have never found that last coffee filter and Prayer-Girls would have been ruined. So thank you for that."
steven,Amen.
debbie,And thank you for Steffie's allergy screen coming back all negative. I always knew it was in your plan for her to enjoy nuts. And finally I want to thank you for this man Jesus. This man who works so hard to make us happy without even a thought for himself.
steven,Amen.
debbie,"Sometimes when I think of how happy I am, I just want to cry. Like the time when you--"
steven, Okay let's wrap it up...
debbie,"And in your gracious name, I find thee and praise thee. Amen."
steven,Amen.
steven,I'm absolutely bushed.
debbie,Me too.
steven,"Deb- You know how, as a cop, I have lots of access? You know- records and things?"
debbie, Steven-
steven," Now do you think it's, you know, unethical, to use that to find my mother?"
debbie,"Oh... that.   Yeah, um, well I don't know-"
steven,I swear honey- getting around the system's so easy. No one would even know I did it.
debbie,"I know you want to find her Steven, but you need to think about this."
steven,"You're right, I shouldn't have done it."
debbie,"You did it!? Oh my God, Steven- what'd you find?"
steven,I haven't looked. It's downstairs.
debbie,Really? Well let's go!
steven,Well hold on- let me finish.
debbie,"Oh, right."
steven,There- that's got it.
debbie,What?
steven,She's right here. She's been right here all this time.
debbie,It's really her?
steven,Yeah. No question.
debbie,"My goodness Steven, that's wonderful."
steven,Are you Barbra Bascombe?
steven," In a manner of speaking, yes. You gave up a baby for adoption, correct?"
steven,Elizabeth City? St Jude's Hospital? Remember?
steven,"You were young. I know that you made a mistake giving me away, but-"
steven,Shhhhhh.   Mommy please- let me finish.
steven,"No, it's okay, I know everything.    But it's fine. Just tell me why--"
steven,"Okay, okay. I understand. It's a lot at once. But I can come back. How's that? I can come back later, I'll bring us some coffee and we can talk about...  WHY YOU ABANDONED ME AND KEPT YOUR OTHER TWO CHILDREN! I WAS THE MIDDLE CHILD! WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME?! WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME!?"
stephanie,I can't find my blue fish.
steven, In the laundry room.
debbie,Steven you haven't met our new neighbors down two and across the street- Neil and Sara.
steven,No I haven't. I hope you're planning on changing the paint. What do you call that color?
neil,Oh we're changing it.
steven,"Good, good, good... good."
neil,So Debbie tells me you used to be in the police force back in Georgia.
steven,Virginia Beach.
neil,Right. Sorry...
sara, Neil...
steven,"Yeah, kinda lost interest.     Got back into the family business."
neil,Which is?
steven,Produce. I work for Sysco.
neil,That's a big outfit. They give you that Corvette out there?
steven,Yes sir-ee.
debbie,"Great benefits, too."
steven,And the hours don't crush me either.    I get plenty of home time.
debbie,It's good to have him where I can keep an eye on him.
steven, Among other things...
sara,Ooooooh! Watch out!
steven,"I'm gonna come, I'm gonna come..."
moustached man,DO IT MAN! COME IN MY ASS!
little girl,I see a pony! What do you see!?
little boy,I see a diesel train!
young steven,I see a wiener.
young steven,A man's wiener.
little boy,Shut up! There's no wiener!
young steven,Uh huh!
little girl,Oh I see it. There it is!
young steven,Told ya...
moustached man,DO IT MAN! COME IN MY ASS!
moustached man,"You be careful out there, you're a little drunk."
steven, I haven't lived my life.
paramedic,Try not to talk sir.
steven," Fuck you... No one is going to tell me what to do anymore. No more lies. I'm going to live my life. My way. Be the real me. Time for some good living. Buy what I want, do what I want, fuck who I want. My way."
paramedic,Okay sir whatever you say.
steven,I'm gonna be a fag.
paramedic,Okay.
steven,A big fag...
paramedic,Alright.  Let's move.
steven,"Honey, I'm gay!"
lawyer,Your check.
steven,"Thank you.  With great difficulty, Steven gets on his crutches and makes his exit.  STEVEN  Now it didn't happen all at once. It was sort of a gradual thing..."
produce manager,These are gorgeous. U.S-1 right?
steven, Finest in the land...
saleswoman,Cash or charge?
steven,Charge...
saleswoman,Thank you...  ...Mister Evans. Can I see some ID?
steven,Of course.
kemple,Oh wow...
steven,What do you think? Yes?
kemple,Well Steven it's beautiful.     It really is.
steven,You don't like it.
kemple,"No, no, no.   I do."
steven,You don't like it.
kemple,I'm menstruating. Don't listen to me.
steven,Tell me what's wrong with it.        Is it the gold?
kemple,Well...
steven,That's why I got you the stainless!
kemple,Steven!
steven,"The gold one is for me, dipshit."
debbie,Merry Christmas.
steven,Hi Debbie!
debbie,How's Jimmy?
steven,Good.   Did you get the gifts?
debbie,Well that's why I'm calling...
steven,You're welcome!
debbie,I can't keep this.
steven,Why not?
debbie,Well... it's not Christian.
steven,Not Christian? Why's that?
debbie,This is not what the Lord wants.
steven,So you're saying you know what the Lord wants?
debbie,No. I would never say that. Why? Do you think this is what he wants?
steven,It's the leap of faith Deb.       It's the not knowing that's the answer.
debbie,Well I never thought about it that way...
debbie,Steven!
steven,Morning Sandy!
cherubic secretary,Morning Steven. You have visitors.
steven,Okey-dokey!
steven, Sorry.
kemple,Why didn't you tell me?
steven,"I can't go to prison, Jimmy. I can't. I can't go to prison. I can't. I can't..."
kemple,Okay-okay calm down. It's okay. I just want to tell them you're awake and we can take it from there.
debbie,Did you know Steven was wanted?
kemple,Not until just now.
debbie,He likes to keep little secrets sometimes.
kemple,Like the fact that he was a big queer?
debbie,"Yeah, like that."
kemple,"But suicide, my god."
debbie,Well he does tend to overreact.
kemple,I feel like I don't even know him.
debbie,"Well Jimmy, that's the thing. I'm not really sure he knows who he is. He's searching, at least that's how I figure it. I'm just not sure he knows what it is he's looking for."
kemple, Can you tell me exactly what he did?
cop,"He has several warrants out in Texas. Fraud, forgery, embezzlement..."
debbie,What?
kemple,I should have known... I should have said something.
debbie,Don't blame yourself Jimmy... I did the same thing. There were always signs. I should have known he was gay when he started shaving his chest.
kemple,That would be a warning sign...
debbie,And all that Peter Allen music on his Walkman.
kemple,Denial is a powerful thing. I don't feel so bad now.
debbie,I just never thought. But now stealing?
kemple,He's probably been doing it for years.    I say to myself he did it just to buy me things but I don't think that's true.
debbie,It's bigger than that. I'm sure.
kemple,But why then?
debbie,And why suicide? I mean- just like that?
kemple,I know- he seemed so happy and--
debbie,Steven!!!
kemple,Steven!!! Stop!
steven,Hi. Welcome to prison.     I'm Steven.
steven, Or you could try to suck the guys' dick. Your choice.
steven,Law Library. I pretty much live here. I don't really have anyone on the outside except my ex-wife- so I just hunker down here learning everything there is to know about the law. Ask me anything.
steven,"Three meals a day. Not so bad. Just make sure if you make enemies with someone, he doesn't work here. Otherwise you'll wake up one morning shitting blood and find out you've been eating ground glass in your cornbread for six weeks.  Arnie notices one of the INMATES working in the kitchen SPITTING a loogey into the mashed potatoes. He mixes it in and CACKLES with glee.  Steven pays no mind.  STEVEN  Let me introduce you to the mail guy. His name's Gary."
gary," ...letters, magazines, shit like that- it all goes through unmolested. But if Grandma's sending you cookies, or porn or brownies or whatever-- you're gonna have to pay for it if you wanna get it. Five bucks per item or you can suck my dick."
steven,Your choice.
steven,Well that's about it. You're gonna be fine. Don't worry. And if you need anything you just let me know. Alright?
arnie,"So, uh, do I need to suck your dick?"
steven,That'd be great.  Steven gently shoves his new cellmate into the cell.
steven,Hey Debbie. Hi Sweetheart. Sorry I missed you. I thought one o'clock was our time but maybe not. I sure miss you guys. Thanks for the picture and the article. Sometimes it's just nice to know there's someone out there who still cares about me since Jimmy left and all. So... uh...
phillip, Thanks. Guess I need a few extra inches.
steven,Glad to help. How's the bird?
phillip,"Huh?  Oh. Him, yeah... he's at peace."
steven,"Oh, I'm sorry."
phillip,It was for the best. He was suffering.
steven," Civil law? You know, I'm an attorney."
phillip,Really?
steven,You suing someone?
phillip,I don't know what I'm doing. There's a guy I know- he's in the infirmary now. He's sick- he's real sick... AIDS. I thought maybe I could find a way to get him some help- I mean real help. Not here. I don't know- maybe I could-- I don't even know what I'm looking for...
steven,Does he have a lawyer?
phillip,Yeah.
steven,Have him get in touch with the Prisoner Rights Committee. They deal with this all the time- pro bono. I've got the number.
phillip,"Well thank you, I--"
steven,My name's Steven Russell.
phillip,"Pleased to meet you Steven Russell, my name's Phillip Morris."
steven,I haven't seen you around Phillip. I'm always in the yard...
phillip,"I don't go to the yard. You know what happens to blonde haired, blue eyed queers in the yard..."
steven,It is kind of rough out there.  You don't look like you belong here Phillip.
phillip,I don't.
steven,Why are you here?
phillip,I rented a car... and kept it too long.
steven,Grand theft?
phillip,Theft of service.
steven,Insurance fraud.
phillip,No. Just theft of service.
steven,No.     Me. Insurance fraud.
phillip,"Damn, we're both in a mess aren't we?"
steven,"Don't seem fair, does it?"
phillip,"No, it don't."
steven,"You know, I keep finding that life's a little shittier than I thought it was gonna be."
phillip,"Oh, listen to you, Gloomy Gus. I think you're gonna be just fine, Steven Russell."
steven, I guess I'm inclined to believe you.
phillip,Why's that?
steven,"I met you today, didn't I?"
steven," ...I made the mistake of writing her and saying I was lonely in here. And next thing you know, my ex-wife catches her putting the neighbor's puppy in a box to mail to me."
phillip,"Ohhhhh, she sounds so sweet..."
steven,Oh she's an angel.  I think I'll be sure to write her back and tell her I'm not lonely anymore... that I made a good friend.
phillip,Why'd I have to meet you today?
steven,Something wrong?
phillip,It's just- I'm being transferred to Michael Unit today.
steven,What?
phillip,I'm sorry.
steven,Don't be sorry. It's just across the yard.
phillip,Well I don't go into that yard so it might as well be Oklahoma.  Just figures with my luck. I was born Friday the 13th...
steven,"It's not gonna change a thing, Phillip. In fact, Friday the 13th's my lucky day. Don't worry, this right here. This is destiny."
phillip,But we only just met.
steven,"Listen, I've loved a lot. And I've been around, so I recognize the feeling. "
phillip,Don't you think you're coming on a little strong?
steven,"I know you're trying to protect yourself, I get that. It's fine. Give me a chance to prove you wrong."
phillip,I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
steven,Good...
phillip,Yes.
phillip,Hurry up would you?
cleavon,"I ain't no motherfucking DHL, faggot. Besides I ain't got nothing for you anyway..."
phillip,But it's been three days.
cleavon,"You got a tracking number, motherfucker?"
phillip,No.
cleavon,Then shut your faggot ass.
phillip,"Congratulations Phillip, scared off another one."
corrections officer,Morris - you got a new roommate.
phillip,Oh my God. How the hell did you do this?
steven,I know a guy. I took care of it.   I'm gonna take care of everything...
phillip,"Enough romance, let's fuck."
phillip,And for a while I was Executive Assistant to a Broadway Producer...
steven,Really? What's a Broadway producer doing in Atlanta?
phillip,I didn't ask.
steven,What'd you do for him?
phillip,"I mainly just rode around town in his limo, drinking and sucking him off."
steven,Apache? What was his name?
phillip,Melvin.
steven,Phillip- you amaze me.
phillip,What? He was a nice guy too.
steven,That's what I'm saying- you only see the good.
phillip,That's the Screecher next door. He does it all night. I never get any sleep. He drives me crazy.
steven,You poor thing. How awful...
large prisoner,I'm gonna cut out your motherfucking tongue with your screeching all night.
phillip,What does he care- he ain't in our block...
bald prisoner,Someone probably paid him.
phillip,Get up...
steven,Me?
phillip,Don't bullshit me. Did you pay to have him beat up?
steven,Well you said he bothered you.
phillip,Just answer me.
steven,"Yeah. Yeah, I did."
phillip,Steven...
steven,"I just want you to be happy, baby."
phillip,You are so amazing!!!
cleavon,No man- not now.
cleavon,How important?
cleavon,"Yeah, alright."
cleavon,Fuck you- my word's my bond motherfucker.
phillip,C'mon...
steven,What?
phillip,C'mon. Dance.
steven,No. No... I can't dance.
phillip,Yes you can.
steven,No I can't. I'm serious...
phillip,"Honey, you're queer- it comes with the package."
steven,Well not me.
phillip,"C'mon, I'll show you...  He drags him up and begins his lesson.  PHILLIP  Hold me here... and here. Okay watch...  Steven stumbles his way through the slow dance for a while, but with Phillip's help he begins to settle in.  Soon they are nestled into each other, swaying sweetly to the music."
latino man,Yeah you fucking bitch...
phillip,What's happening?
guard,You're transferred. Nonney snitched you out about the Screecher. You're going to Ramsey Two.
steven,Ah shit...
phillip,Wait!
steven,Don't you touch him!
phillip,Steven-
steven,Don't worry Phillip- I'll-
guard,Shut up and move.
phillip,Steven!
phillip,STEVEN!! STEVEN!
phillip,I wanna go in the yard.
yard guard,You do?
phillip,I WANNA GO IN THE YARD!
yard guard,Hold your horses Dorothy.
phillip,STEVEN!!!!
steven,What the hell are you doing!?
phillip,I love you!
steven,I love you too!
phillip,GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY WAY!!!
steven,"Hi, how are you?"
taxi driver,I'm well. Where you headed? The Greyhound?
steven,Nearest thrift store please.
taxi driver," Sure. You mind if I tell you the word of our Lord, Jesus Christ?"
steven,"Hi there, my name's Steven Rousseau. I'm an attorney. My client is Phillip Morris. I called earlier."
duty officer,Mmm hmmm. There you are. Rousseau... Phillip Morris. Like the cigarette huh?
steven,I beg your pardon?
phillip,"You said you'd come right away, but Jesus!"
steven,"I got work to do honey, I'm getting you out of here early. I got a hearing tomorrow morning, I got motions to file. The law don't sleep baby."
phillip,I love you so much.
steven,"Phillip, you are the sweetest, most gentle man I have ever met. And I know people have taken advantage of that. But I don't ever want you ever to lose that innocence. I want to build a life with you Phillip. I want to protect you."
phillip,Get me out of here.
steven,"The motion was filed, I presented to the DA and got a letter from the judge- I do not understand what the hold up is. I'm not some paralegal- I am Steven fucking Rousseau and I expect proper adjudication!"
housewife,How nice...
steven,You want mayo with that?
steven,I have an early release order for Phillip Morris.
release officer,Yep- Morris- we got him right here waiting.
steven,I'm his lawyer.
phillip,You're incredible.
steven,I know.
baylor,Phillllip!     It's so good to see you...
blake,Oh my God! You look great. Prison agreed with you. How do I get on that diet?
phillip,Oh you couldn't handle it- not unless we smuggled an espresso machine in a cake.
blake,Throw in a Sicilian Barista and I'm there!
phillip,This is Steven. Steven- Blake and Baylor.
blake, This is him?! This is your gay lawyer prison boyfriend?! Pleased to meet you.
baylor,Much better than the guy who had you kidnapped. What was his name?
phillip,Long story.
steven, Can I get you all a drink?
steven,We gotta get a bigger place.
phillip,Steven I want you to meet my old neighbor- Eudora Mixon. She is just the sweetest.
eudora,Pleasure Steven.
steven,Eudora...
phillip,Eudora owns a little building in Montrose and she's having a hell of time with the builder. He sounds like a real asshole.
eudora,His plans were useless and he's trying to sue me to pay him! I need your expertise Steven. Phillip says maybe you can help.
steven,I could certainly try.
eudora,"Can you still practice law, having been to prison?"
steven,Sure- why not?
eudora,I just thought- Oh what do I know? I'd just be glad to have someone I could trust. I'll pay your normal fee.
steven,It would be my pleasure. Litigation is my speciality.
steven,Sorry I'm late but I've been hung up in court all day. Let's go in.
steven,It's a beautiful fixture.
judge,I know.   It's your turn.
steven,"Oh...  Your Honor, Ms. Mixon engaged Mr. Gage service in good faith and was given an inferior product. She is entitled to deem that work to be unacceptable according to the contract that Mr. Evans signed."
lawyer,"The terms of that contract were ambiguous at best. The truth is, defendant engaged my client for three years without full payment."
steven,"Your honor I have, in my briefcase, fourteen other contracts, all on public record, in which Mr. Evans entered into litigation with past clients of his!"
lawyer, Is this true?
evans,No.
lawyer,You're making me look like an idiot.
judge,He is right Mr. Russell- what do you have to say?
steven,I demand to be seen in chambers!!
judge,Okaaaaaaaay...
judge,"Okay gentlemen, let's get this over with, the two for one at the Crab Boiler ends at five o'clock."
lawyer,"This seems to be cut and dried here, sir. I don't even know why we're back here. Mister Russell is treating this like an episode of Matlock."
steven,I'll admit your honor- I'm a plain spoken man. I didn't go to Princeton. I didn't go to Yale. My education was modest. I went to a small school. I grew up on a small farm. But I passed the same bar exam as my colleague here and I am not going to let him push around this humble woman.
judge,Point taken Mister Russell...
steven,I think it's obvious where I'm going with this sir.
judge,Are you talking about Marshall vs. Chao?
lawyer, Shit...
steven,"Your honor, that's exactly what I'm talking about."
steven,YES! I did great! Can you believe how great I did!?
eudora," Yes. You did very well, Steven. Thank you."
steven,"I mean, I did great! Really great! I'm so proud of myself! You want half my sandwich?!"
eudora,Um...
steven,No! We're going out!    I'm paying!!
phillip,"Oh my God, it's amazing."
steven,I thought you'd like it honey.
phillip,Can we afford this?
steven,You let me worry about the money sweetheart.
phillip,"Okay, well I guess I better start packing boxes."
steven,Not this weekend.
phillip,Why not?
steven,I think we both need a vacation. Key West?  Phillip smiles.
phillip,How'd you know he'd do that?
steven,I didn't. I just knew I wanted `em for you... and I found a way to do it. That's all.
phillip,Just listenin' huh?
steven,That's it...
steven,Were you a spaceman?
lindholm,Yep. Never got out there though. NASA's a real political place. Never could figure out whose ass to kiss to get a mission.  All in the past. Barely even think about it now...
steven,"A spaceman, huh? How do you crap up there?"
lindholm,Ass gasket.  Have a seat.
steven,"I could not speak more highly of Steven Russell, Mr. Lindholm . A real straight shooter. We were damn lucky to have him at Prudential as long as we did."
phillip,Brando's wet debut?
steven,On the Waterfront.
lindholm,Employee of the year two years running? Developing software with IBM? You're the kind of people we need here Steven. We want you as our Chief Financial Officer. So what do you say? I want your answer right now. C'mon Steven- let's light this candle.
rheba,"...for example ""he's in a meeting"" sounds better than ""he's away from his desk"" at least I think so, but whatever you prefer."
steven,That's fine... sure.
rheba,"I pulled all the claims for the last two years as well as the statements, transfers and confirmations from the bank. Most of it's routine and I think you can get up to speed in a day or two.  Anything else I can do for you?"
steven,Uh.... cup of coffee?
rheba,I'll do it today but I don't do that really.
mark,"Crossover from traditional markets shows declination and inverse diffusion seems commensurate with net-trade trending. HMO penetration still leads PPO, NMO and FMO as usual but attenuation is growing more prevalent in Q4 as projected... As for Q3, well Q3 is what Q3 always is: Q2 with training wheels."
birkheim,"Okay Steven, your turn. I know you've only had the one quarter to play catch up but I tell you, we can't wait to get some insight here."
steven,Sure. What about?
birkheim,Mark's projections.
steven,Mmm hm.   Sure.
birkheim,They seem kind of flat.
steven,Oh.   Okay. Ummm...
phillip,The tux? Where are you going?
steven,It's just a work thing. Were we supposed to--
phillip,No- I just thought- it's fine. Where you going?
steven,Some stupid gala ball thing...
phillip,Gala? Oh...  Sounds boring.
steven,Yeah.   I'll be home early.   Promise.
lindholm,You see that?
steven,No...  Oh- is it...?
lindholm,Yeah. Probably deploying the arm right now. Just a satellite deployment. Nothing special... Just touching the face of God.
lindholm,"Bev- Ladies- I want you to meet Steven Russell, our CFO."
steven,Good things I hope.
facelift wife,Are you married Steven?
steven,Uh... engaged.
blonde wife,"Well where is she, sweetheart?"
steven,She works. Travels a lot.     It's killing her she couldn't be here.
steven,These are ready for Dan ...
vera,Thanks Steven. You doin' good?
steven,"Kind of. I just got back from my lawyer's office. I asked him, ""What's your fee?"" He says, ""I charge $50 for three questions."" So I ask, ""Don't you think that's a little expensive?"" And he says, ""Yes it is... Now what's your final question?"""
vera,It's so true. Lawyers!
birkheim,That's the thing about the back nine at Pebble Beach. 
lindholm,"I couldn't agree with you more. I remember one time, I was at Augusta..."
secretary,"The woman says,""That's awful expensive, isn't it?"" and the lawyer says, ""Yes and now you only got one question left!"""
lindholm," Anyway like I was saying the Northrup guy says to the NASA ""well that question's gonna cost fifty million to answer"" so NASA says, ""Don't you think that's a lot of money?"" and Northrup says ""Yep, now you owe us another fifty million. Next question please!"""
steven,Yeah that's a good one...
lindholm,"That's why there's so few shuttle missions. They're wasting all their money on bureaucracy. And probes... Unmanned probes.  No mushrooms, I said."
phillip,Golf!?
steven,What?
phillip,You're a homosexual.
steven,It's work.
phillip,"You know, you can tell them.    They can't fire you for being gay."
steven,I know...
phillip,"I'm trying to be understanding here honey, but golf? Why not just eat pussy?"
steven, Wish me luck.
phillip,Good luck!
steven,Oh! This is easy!  Your turn Dan!
lindholm,Hell of a hazard ain't it Steven?
client,"So the black fella says to the jew lawyer- ""50 bucks a question? Ain't that expensive?"" ""Yeah it's expensive,"" he says, ""I'm a Jew, you nigger!"""
rheba,Anything else I can do for you?
steven,Uh.... cup of coffee?
rheba,I'll do it today but I don't do that really.
steven,"So I ask, ""Don't you think that's a little expensive?"" and the lawyer says, ""Yes it is, now what's your final question?"""
vera,It's so true. Lawyers!
lindholm,"Steven, we got a problem. Vera lost that stupid rubber stamp again. Her office is a goddamned disaster and she's the o-ring if you know what I'm saying."
steven, Oh... how long till we can get a new one?
lindholm,Nope. Time to overhaul the program. I got a computerized system already on order. No more room for pilot error.
steven,Really?! Great!
lindholm,You play golf?
steven,Uhhh... yeah. Sure.
phillip, How big was this Christmas bonus?
steven, Pretty big.
phillip,In July?
steven,No.
phillip,I swear. It's in the Ricky Martin People in the bathroom.
steven,Mmm hmm...
phillip,They can find out anything about anyone... anything.  They could even find out something about you...
steven,Phillip... what is it?
phillip,It's just-- Is something going on? Something you're not telling me?
steven,No.
phillip,"Because if there is, stop now."
steven,There isn't.    There's nothing.
phillip,"I don't care about the money, the house, jet-skis- all I want is you. I just want us to be together."
steven,"We're always going to be together. And there is nothing going on. I promise.  I wouldn't lie to you, baby."

steven, I didn't want you to find out...
phillip,"Steven. Oh God... Why didn't you write me? I don't know how this happened, they say I'm fine. Oh God, who did this?  But it was never better, never more real than with you Steven. I realize now that all that crazy shit you did- in your fucked up way- it was always for me. Always for us. You are the most amazing man Steven. It takes my breath away.

steven,I know- I'm sorry- You weren't supposed to find out.
phillip,Well I did!
steven,"I couldn't take a chance telling you. You know that. I couldn't. But Phillip, I only did it so I could get here to you.  Just to talk to you. And here I am."
phillip,You're so skinny.
steven,I'm fine. Just hungry.
phillip,Steven I don't-
steven,"Wait. Listen. I just came here to tell you one thing and that's it. You don't have to take me back, I just want to say one thing."
phillip,How do I know you're not bullshitting me again?
steven,You don't.
