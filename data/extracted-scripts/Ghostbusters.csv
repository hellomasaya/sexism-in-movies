Speaker,Dialogue
act one,------- FADE IN:
zeke,"Sump'n's stirrin' up the chickens, Maude."
maude,"Jes' set easy, Zeke.  I'll take a look-see."
maude," Here, chick-chick-chick-chick."
maude,What's got you girls so durned upset? There a coyote sneakin' 'round?
zeke," Everythin' okay out there, Maude?"
ray,And Winston's in the kitchen doing your dishes.
egon," ...one minute, fifty-three seconds."
peter," Thanks, Slimer.  I really needed that!"
slimer,Sorreee!
ray, Egon!  The phone!
egon," In a minute, Ray."
winston, Ghostbusters Central.
winston,Calm down... Where are you?...  We'll be right there.
winston,Ready for this one?  Some farmer says his wife was eaten by a giant chicken.
peter,"Hey, even a half-baked false alarm sounds better than doing Egon's chores.  Let's roll!"
egon,"I think I've finally perfected it.  Watch this, guys.  Guys?"
ray,It sure feels strange not having Egon with us.
peter," Why?  Lately even when he's with us, he's not with us."
winston,But wouldn't it be somethin' if he sells that weather balloon idea of his?  He'll be a rich man!
peter,Good.  Then he can hire a maid to do his share of the chores.
zeke,"Had big blood-red eyes, it did.  Biggest dang chicken I ever seen.  Mebbe six feet tall."
winston,Shouldn't be hard to find.
ray,Did it have any distinguishing marks?
peter,Ray!  It's six feet tall!
peter," This one's easy, guys.  Old Zeke's been watchin' too many horror movies and eating too much greasy popcorn."
ray,"No, Peter, I think we're dealing with a bonafide werechicken here."
winston,A werechicken?
peter,"Get serious, Ray."
ray,Then explain those!
ray," What'd I tell you, Peter?  A werechicken egg!  Gimme a hand, Winston!"
peter,"Look, if this is a werechicken egg,"
ray, I dunno... that is strange.
winston,Let's get it back to Headquarters and run some tests.  Then maybe we'll have some answers.
ray,"Oh no, I'm not leavin'.  The werechicken that laid this has gotta be around here someplace -- and I'm gonna find it."
peter," I'll take it.  C'mon, Slimer."
peter," Yo, balloon man, we've got some real work for you:  How about analyzing this?"
egon,Interesting.  That's the second biggest egg I've ever seen.
peter,"I don't wanna hear about it, Egon.  We've had a long night in a not-too-fragrant barnyard, so I'm taking a shower and hitting the sheets."
winston," Ray, it's gettin' pretty late.  Maybe there really isn't any..."
ray, Shh!
ray, It's in there.
winston, Then let's get it!
winston," Man, this place is creepy."
ray, It's in here -- I can feel it.
winston,Look out!
ray, Something's close.  Very close.
winston,"Man, he is ugly!"
ray,"Bad choice of words, Winston."
ray,Trap out!
winston,Hang on!  That's it!
ray,We've almost got him!
ray," Well, that takes care of one werechicken."
winston,"Ray, I just had a thought..."
egon," Thanks for the help, Slimer, but I don't have time to examine this egg tonight.  I have to prepare for my weather balloon demonstration tomorrow morning."
slimer,Yeah.
slimer," G'night, Egon."
egon,"Goodnight, Slimer."
slimer,Fooooood.
slimer, Yummy!
peter, Slimer!  How 'bout some privacy??
slimer, Monster!  Inna kitchen!
peter,Monster?
egon, Ow!
peter," Well, Slimer, I don't see anything here that looks like a monster."
peter,Holy cow!!
act two,------- INT. -- GHOSTBUSTERS LAB -- NIGHT
peter," What'd you do to Egon, you bird-brain!"
peter, Hey!
peter, What's wrong with you guys?  That thing ate Egon!
ray,"Peter, that is Egon!  The egg hatched, he was bitten and now he's a werechicken!"
peter," Come to think of it, there was a certain resemblance."
winston, What happened?  He's so quiet all of a sudden.
ray,It's the moon!
peter,"Ray, what's this have to do with Egon being a chicken?"
ray," Werechickens only appear during a full moon, and for the next few minutes, the moon's not full."
ray, Egon?
egon,"Ray, what is going on?"
peter,"Sit down, Egon, we have some good news and some bad news."
egon, Bad news first.
winston,You've been turned into a werechicken!
egon,A werechicken?
ray," That egg Peter brought in, it hatched and..."
egon, I remember the bite clearly.  How long will I stay like this?
ray," According to this, there is an antidote. But we've gotta move fast -- the eclipse only lasts three minutes!"
ray," ""One tablespoon paprika, one clove of garlic, some parsley for color, cup of gelatin..."""
egon, I don't feel well.
peter," Hurry it up, guys!"
ray," ""And one tablespoon of chickenbane."""
slimer, No chickenbane!
ray,Then we've gotta go with this!  C'mon!
ray," Quick, Egon, drink this!"
winston,We're too late!
peter,What happened?
ray,"The potion only partly worked, because of the missing chickenbane."
peter,"Well, we hafta do something!"
egon,"Don't get your feathers ruffled, Peter. There's a logical solution to every problem."
winston,What was that?
ray,The werechicken that bit Egon.  It's still out there somewhere.
peter," Un, no offense, Egon."
peter, All quiet on the chicken front.  How about down there?
ray,Not a peep.
winston, No pun intended.
winston,That's it!
box boy, It's in there!  A big chicken!  It's gotta be ten feet tall!
winston,Ten feet tall?
box boy, I'm outta here!
ray, Let's split up.
winston,How could we lose a fifteen foot-tall chicken?
ray,We didn't!  Come on!
butcher,A giant chicken just came through here -- it was thirty feet tall!
winston,Thirty feet tall?
peter," Ray, you were right!  The chicken's here, and he's a walking high-rise!"
ray," On our way, Peter."
janine,Egon!  What happened?
egon,"It's a long story, Janine.   Can you get my coat, please?  I'm due at the weather board in forty-five...  ...minutes."
janine,But what ...?  Nevermind.
janine,Are you sure you wanna go to a meeting like -- this?
egon,Trust me.  I'm of sound mind at least.
peter, It's heading down 34th toward the Empire State Building.
peter,"Take over, Slimer!"
slimer,Roger!
ray,Let's reel him in!
winston, Trap's full!  Somebody forgot to empty it!
ray, Whose job was it?
peter,"So how're we gonna, put that big bird on ice, guys'"
ray," Peter, that's not a bed idea!  Chicken freezes at very low temperatures!"
winston,"Yeah, but how do you freeze a 50-foot chicken in August?"
egon,"Distinguished members of the Weather Board, my weather balloon has the clu-cluck-clu- capability --"
egon," I, er, can explain this, but --"
egon,What?
peter," Egon, can we freeze that big chicken with your weather balloons"
egon," Yes, but you'll have to work the controls."
peter, Piece of cake.
winston,What's it doing?
ray,It looks like it's about to lay an --
winston, I don't want to hear it.
egon,"Okay, Peter, the balloon's in position. Turn the lever to the extreme left."
egon," You bet, Maude."
peter,Lemme guess -- more chickenbane soup!
egon,I'm actually starting to like it.
maude,"No more werechicken problems for us, eh, Egon? "
winston,Uh-oh.
ray,It came from the lab!
winston, It's just Slimer groovin' to his new James Brown tape.
peter," Tell me, how do I get out of this chicken outfit?"
