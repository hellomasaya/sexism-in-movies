Speaker,Dialogue
2.,"1   CONTINUED:                                                       1 The RUNNING MAN leans down as if to assist, but instead just picks up the smoker's broken umbrella and studies it. The MAN in the deerstalker hat's eyes widen as he recognizes his famous assailant."
man,Sherlock Holmes?!
holmes,"My apologies. Send the bill to John Watson, 221B Baker Street."
another angle," Holmes bursts out of an alley, sprints round a corner and runs across a courtyard to a side door.  WE PULL BACK to see the FACADE OF ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL. "
thug,"What's goin' on, John?"
holmes,"Hhhmm, good cigar. Who do you work for?"
5.,7   CONTINUED:                                                          7 ANOTHER ANGLE
holmes,Watson.    Perfect timing.
watson,Nice hat.
holmes,Just got it.    Where's Lestrade?
watson,Getting his troops in formation. Is that your blood or theirs?
holmes,I don't know.    It's an old shirt.
watson,You left this behind.
holmes,Knew I'd forgotten something. Thought I'd left the stove on.
watson,You did.
holmes,Right.    Shall we?
5a.,"7   CONTINUED:                                               7 He can see the hat, but not the man underneath."
watson,"Yeah, s'me."
watson,The girl. 
7.,"9A   CONTINUED:                                                     9A The girl bends with alarming and mechanical suddenness, picks up the sword and turns it on herself, ready to plunge the point into her heart."
watson,"Lord Blackwood?! Blackwood applauds softly, strangely."
blackwood,"Well done, Holmes. And Watson as well."
watson,Stay right there.
blackwood,"Tell me, doctor, as a medical man, how did you like my work?  The fifth one was so scrawny, it was over before I'd finished the first incision."
holmes,No.
holmes,Look.
8.,"9A   CONTINUED:                                                 9A Holmes seems to be pointing at Blackwood.   Watson looks, sees nothing."
holmes,Look.
blackwood,What a shame.    That would've been fun.
holmes,"Impeccable timing, Lestrade."
lestrade, Is that -- ?
watson,It is.
holmes, And one for the rope.
lestrade,You should've waited for my help.
holmes,"If I had, you'd be cleaning up a corpse and chasing a rumor. Besides, the girl's parents hired me, not the Yard.  I can't imagine why they thought you'd need any assistance."
9.,"9A    CONTINUED:                                               9A Lestrade turns, frustrated. He watches his men yank Blackwood out of his double circle, put chains on him, while others carry the girl away on a stretcher. She's still mouthing the incantation."
lestrade,What do you make of that?
holmes,Some kind of ceremony. Five girls killed beneath cathedrals at the height of the full moon.  The double circle's for his own protection.
lestrade,London will breathe a sigh of relief --
watson,-- at the excellent work of Scotland Yard. As usual.
holmes,"Bravo, Lestrade. Have a cigar."
captain philips,"Me nerves are the best they been in years, thanks to you."
11aa.,12   CONTINUED:                                                 12 Watson is pleased by that.
captain philips,"Tell me something -- your new offices. There won't be so many stairs, I hope?"
watson,"No -- ground floor. And there'll be a woman's touch, too. "
11a.,12   CONTINUED:  I think we can start to wean you off the medicine --
watson,"Let's give it a little longer, just to be safe.  I'll be right back."
watson,You're not going in at all.
watson,"He just needs a new case, that's all."
watson,I smell burning.
watson,Why don't you take Captain Philips and give him a nice cup of tea.
watson, And perhaps some tea and bread up here when you can.
12a.,"13   CONTINUED:                                                    13 Nonetheless, Watson   stops, takes a deep breath, gathers himself. Something    like this has happened before  the difference being, now, that Watson is   sick to death of dealing with it."
15.,"14   CONTINUED:                                               14 WATSON ... and your friend, you've been in this room for two weeks. I insist you get out of here."
holmes,"There's nothing of interest to me out there, on earth, at all."
watson,"So, you have nothing to do?"
holmes,Nothing.
watson,Then you're free this evening.
holmes,Absolutely.
watson,Mary's coming.
holmes,Not available.
watson,"You're meeting her, Holmes."
holmes,Have you proposed yet?
watson,I'm still looking for the right ring.
holmes,Then it's not official.
16.,"14   CONTINUED:                                               14 WATSON It's happening, like it or not. Half past eight. The Royale."
watson,And wear a jacket.
watson,Holmes!   You're early. HOLMES Fashionably.
watson,May I present Miss Mary Morstan.
holmes,My pleasure. For the life of me I don't know why it's taken him so long to get us properly introduced.
mary,"The pleasure's mine. It really is a thrill to meet you, Mr. Holmes. "
16a.,15   CONTINUED:                                                 15 MARY  It's true.
17.,"15   CONTINUED:                                                15 MARY They can seem a bit far-fetched sometimes, though. Making these grand assumptions out of tiny details."
holmes," Oh, no no. The little details are by far the most important. Take Watson..."
mary,I intend to.
holmes,"... see that walking-stick? A rare African snakewood hiding a blade of high-tensile steel. A few were awarded to veterans of the Afghan war, so I can assume he's a decorated soldier. Strong, brave, born to be a man of action. And neat, like all military men. Then I check his pockets... ah. A stub from a boxing match. Now I can infer he's a bit of a gambler.  I'd keep an eye on that, by the way."
watson,Those days are behind me.
holmes,"Yes, right behind you.  He's cost us the rent more than once."
mary,"With all due respect, Mr. Holmes, you know him. But what about a perfect stranger? What can you tell about me?"
watson,I don't think that's necessary --
17a.,"15   CONTINUED:                                                   15 HOLMES Yes, I doubt --"
mary,"No, it'd be wonderful.   I insist."
holmes,You insist?  You're a governess.
mary,Well done.
watson,"Yes, well done. So shall we --"
mary,"Charlie's 7, actually."
holmes,It's breathing.  Then he's tall for his age.
18.,15   CONTINUED:                                                15 HOLMES He flicked ink at you today.
mary,Is there ink on my face?
watson,There's nothing wrong with your face.
waiter,The gentleman has already ordered for himself.  What would madam care for this evening?
watson,"Give us a few minutes, please."
holmes,"There are two drops on your ear... India blue's nearly impossible to wash off, anyway. A very impetuous act by the boy, but you're too experienced to react rashly -- which is why the lady you work for lent you that necklace. It's from Asprey's, flawless, not the gems of a governess.  However, the jewels you're not wearing tell us rather more."
19.,15   CONTINUED:                                                15 WATSON Holmes.
holmes,You were engaged.
holmes,The ring is gone. But the lighter skin where it sat suggests you spent some time abroad wearing it proudly.
holmes,"Or at least until someone informed you of its true and rather modest worth, at which point you broke off the engagement and returned to England for better prospects. A doctor perhaps."
mary, Right on all counts but one. I didn't leave my fiance... he died.
20.,"15     CONTINUED:                                                15 WATSON Well done, old man."
holmes,She's lovely.
holmes' pov," Happy couples eating, laughing, talking. Suddenly, Holmes hears no words. He just sees their mouths moving. The sound of silverware clinking and scraping on fine china rises to an ORCHESTRAL ROAR --  -- which becomes the ROAR of a BLOOD-THIRSTY MOB as a fist smashes into a face with a MEATY THUD.  15A-17 OMITTEDINT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - BARE-KNUCKLE BOXING FIGHT - 5A-17 1 NIGHT  Holmes staggers back from the blow. He tastes his own blood from a split lip. It interests him. He is stripped to the waist, all sinew and gristle. His opponent, McMURDO -- huge but flabby -- bangs his fists together and moves in.  Bets rage back and forth through the pressing CROWD."
holmes' pov," The room and the fight are calm -- the sounds muffled and indistinct -- a complete sensory reversal of his experience in the restaurant. This is soothing to him, the ring is the only place where his mind stops racing."
holmes,Well done.   Thank you.
holmes," Not done. Finished. And as I said, thank you, it was most pleasurable."
22.,"15A-17 CONTINUED:                                              15A-17 Face twisted in disgust, McMurdo strides forward and SPITS CONTEMPTUOUSLY at Holmes, catching him on the back of the head. The crowd falls silent."
holmes,Hm.   Plymouth gin.
guard captain,"Charlie, what the hell's going on down here?"
23.,"18A   CONTINUED:                                                  18A CHARLIE It's Jack, he tried to stop Blackwood from doing his spells. And now he's in some kind of fit."
guard captain," Charlie, get, down here and get him to the infirmary."
guard captain,"All right, Blackwood, what's this all about?"
blackwood,I've a request. GUARD CAPTAIN You don't get nothin' `til you stop this devil nonsense. That's a holy book --
guard captain, -- and you will respect it!
guard captain,"Boy, you want me to muzzle you --"
23a.,"19   CONTINUED:                                                     19 Blackwood keeps whispering.     The Captain falls to one knee, keeps coughing."
24.,"19   CONTINUED:                                                19 GUARD #2 Get him to the infirmary, now!"
blackwood,I've a request.
holmes,I find that it lifts my spirits.
watson,"It's a pathological amorbic process, it increases tissue change and weakness. And you know what a black reaction comes on you afterwards."
24a.,"22   CONTINUED:                                                  22 HOLMES Look at this. If you play a chromatic scale, they move clockwise. As soon as you switch to a pentatonic scale --"
watson, Really? What about when you -- oops --
25.,22   CONTINUED:                                                  22 WATSON Let's go. Lestrade wants you at Pentonville Prison.
holmes,"That's your job, not mine."
watson,You're Blackwood's last request. Says he has information he'll give only to you.
holmes,Look at that structure. What has it been? Five years' work already? Are you aware that is the first combination of bascule and suspension bridge. Very innovative.
26.,23   CONTINUED:                                                    23
holmes,"Oh, I have your cut from last night, by the way. You weren't there so I laid your customary bet --"
holmes,"You're right... I'll keep it with your check book, locked safely away in my drawer."
holmes,The opera house is featuring Don Giovanni and I could easily procure two tickets if you had some cultural inclination this evening.
holmes,"You have the grand gift of silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion."
watson,And your grand gift is the uncanny ability to demoralize people. I was aware she'd been engaged. She told me. Holmes rubs his jaw.
holmes,So that's a `no' to the opera then?
watson,That's my waistcoat.
holmes,It's too small for you.
watson,"Well, it's my property and I want it back. "
26aa.,"23   CONTINUED:                                              23 Holmes hands him the waistcoat which he promptly tosses out of the carriage window. Holmes frowns, looks out the opposite window."
watson,You go ahead. I've no business with him while he's alive.
holmes,Where are all the other prisoners?
guard,"We had to move `em, sir, otherwise we were going to have a riot on our hands. There's something about him... it's like he can get inside your head."
holmes,"I'm sure I can find my own way from here, if you have other duties to attend to."
guard,"Much obliged, sir. Thank you, thank you."
holmes,Love what you've done with the place.
blackwood,Thank you for joining me.
28.,27   CONTINUED:                                                   27 HOLMES A small point of concern.
blackwood,How can I help?
holmes,"I'd already followed the murders with some interest and while my heart went out to the families of the victims, I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery in the stroke of your brush --"
blackwood,You're too kind.
holmes,"However, by comparison, your work in the crypt was akin to a finger painting."
blackwood,"So now you're curious as to whether there's a larger game afoot, and that's why you're really here."
holmes,"Actually, my friend will pronounce you dead shortly and I thought I might keep him company."
blackwood,Allow me to enlighten you. Your mistake is to imagine that anything earthly has led to this moment. Your error in judgement is to assume I've been holding the brush at all -- I am merely the channel.
29.,27   CONTINUED:                                                27 HOLMES My only wish is that I'd caught you earlier. I might have spared five lives.
blackwood,"Those lives were a necessity, a sacrifice. Five otherwise meaningless creatures called to serve a greater purpose."
holmes,"I wonder if they'd let Watson and I dissect your brain -- after you're hanged, of course. I'd wager there's some deformity that would be scientifically significant. Then you would serve a greater purpose, too."
blackwood,"Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze. I'm concerned you underestimate the gravity of coming events.  I sense fragility beneath your mask of logic, and it worries me. Steel your mind, Holmes, I need you."
holmes,"I must say, you've come a long way down from the House of Lords."
blackwood,But I will rise again.
holmes,"Bon voyage, Blackwood."
blackwood,"Pay attention! Three more shall die, and there is nothing you can do to save them. "
29a.,"27   CONTINUED:  You must accept that this is beyond your control, or by the time you realize it was you that made it all possible it will be the last sane thought in your head."
lestrade,What did he want?
holmes,Nothing.
holmes,"Don't think you're needed, Father. Not for this one."
30.,29   CONTINUED:                                                     29 A SHOT OF BLACKWOOD
blackwood,Death is only the beginning.
33a.,30   CONTINUED:                                              30 She stands and pulls out a large bag of coins.
holmes,Keep your money. I didn't say I'd take the case.
irene,They gave me our old room.
irene,"Hello, John."
irene," emerges from the alley holding a lovely bunch of roses. She sniffs them appreciatively, walks on.  CUT TO:"
moriarty,I assume he'll do it?
irene,"Not for money, but for me.   I wager he'll find our man within twenty-four hours."
moriarty,You wager? 
34aa.,33   CONTINUED:                                                    33 IRENE I'm certain.
moriarty,A better word.     I sincerely hope it's accurate.
irene,I --
beggar,"Ow, me leg!"
34a.,34   CONTINUED:                                                   34 COACH DRIVER Get out of it!
beggar,"You run me over, sir, yes you did!"
coach driver,You fell right into the carriage!
beggar,"A little charity would go a long way, yes it would, sir."
watson,"Look at you, I can't believe you ran after her like a schoolboy again. Leaping about, all aflutter. Are you a masochist?"
holmes,Allow me to explain.
watson,"Don't you remember what she did to you? She turned you inside out, she made a proper idiot of you. I'm sorry, you were going to explain something..."
holmes,"Thank you, I --"
watson,"I know, instead of just being tricked into being a witness at her wedding like last time --"
holmes,I don't believe --
watson,"What's she after, anyway?"
36.,35   CONTINUED:                                                    35 HOLMES Now it's time to press on.
36a.,"35     CONTINUED:                                               35 HOLMES No, I'm just saying, one has disproportionate limbs the other does not."
irene,Why don't I see myself out.
irene,"Oh, how nice of you."
37a.,"38B   CONTINUED:                                                  38B IRENE Oh, look, a wallet. Doesn't look like yours, does it? And -- naughty boy -- here's another one. I'll return them, shall I?"
irene,"These are lovely, thank you."
holmes,"Now, that's the Irene I know."
holmes,"This man intrigues me, Watson. He's got Adler on edge."
watson,Which is no mean feat.
holmes,"Well, I may not have a choice. A man has to make a living. After all, I'll be paying the rent entirely on my own."
constable clark,"Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me, at once."
38.,"40   CONTINUED:                                           40 HOLMES  What's he done now, lost his way to Scotland Yard? Watson, grab a compass. You means us."
watson,Us means you.
constable clark,"It's Lord Blackwood, sir. It appears he's come back from the dead."
constable clark,"A groundsman saw him walking through the graves, just this morning."
watson,I'll leave this one in your capable hands. I have tea with Mary and her parents this evening.
holmes,It is not my reputation at stake here.
watson,Look at this mess. Nothing but standard-issue police bootprints. Any possible evidence there might have been has been trampled.
39.,"42   CONTINUED:                                                 42 Holmes offers Lestrade his handkerchief, Lestrade waves it off."
lestrade,Look at those slabs of marble -- they're half a ton each if they're a pound -- smashed outward like they were nothing.
lestrade,"Explain it if you can, Holmes."
holmes,And the coffin?
lestrade,We're digging it up now. The witness is over there. You can question him if you like -- but you won't get much.
lestrade," If you lot don't stop behaving like a bunch of superstitious milk maids, you're on double-time! You're an embarrassment! Also, you're forbidden to talk about this to anyone, not a word. Are we bloody clear on that?"
40.,42   CONTINUED:                                                   42 THE GROUNDSKEEPER
watson,He's in shock.     We should give him a few moments.
lestrade,The witness stated that he saw Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.  Well? You pronounced the man dead.
watson," He had no pulse. HOLMES Inspector, do you know if this is a spruce or a sycamore?"
lestrade,OPEN IT!!
41.,42   CONTINUED:                                               42 But no one moves. The cops pass a CROWBAR around as if it were red-hot. Watson's had enough. He marches forward --
lestrade,That's not Blackwood.
holmes,Now that we have a firm grasp of the obvious...
watson,"Lividity is late stage. Diptera deposits are approximately --  -- three quarters of an inch, putting the time of death at ten to twelve hours ago."
holmes,"Inspector, may I see your pen?"
watson,Missing two incisors in the upper jaw...  Adler's midget.
holmes,"All yours, Inspector."
42.,"42     CONTINUED:                                                42 Holmes and Watson begin walking away from the crypt. Lestrade follows, anxious. Holmes shows him the dusty pocket watch."
holmes,"Scratches around the keyhole where the watch is wound. Most drunks are the same, and pawnbrokers scratch the ticket number and their initials inside the lid. This one has five, so the owner --"
holmes,"Now the game is afoot, Watson."
watson,I fail to see how these fish and chips are different from the three other places we passed along the way.
holmes,Trust me. 
42a.,51   CONTINUED:                                                  51 WATSON Just eat.
watson,"You know, I've seen things in war that I couldn't explain. I once heard a man predict his death, down to the number and placement of the bullet holes that killed him. You have to admit that a supernatural explanation is at least theoretically possible."
43.,"51   CONTINUED:  Never theorize before you have data. Invariably, you end up twisting facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. Adler's midget is the key to this."
holmes,"Hmm... scratches around the keyhole, what does that tell you?"
watson,"The owner was most likely a drunk. Each time he wound the watch his hand would slip, hence the scratches."
holmes,"Very good, Watson! You've developed considerable powers of your own."
holmes,"Let's see now, there are several sets of initials scored into the lid."
watson,Pawnbroker's marks.
holmes,Excellent.
holmes,The most recent is M.H...
watson,Maddison and Haig.
43a.,"51   CONTINUED:                                                51 HOLMES Oh my Lord, here we are. They should give us an address."
watson,There's one thing you've missed. On the watch.
holmes,I think not.
watson,"The time. Which leads me to deduce that I'm already late for my appointment with Mary. You remember, the one I was leaving for before you talked me into coming to dig up dead bodies with you."
palm reader,"Reckon your future, sir?"
holmes,Perhaps we do need a little help from the beyond.
watson,"No, thank you."
palm reader,You need to hear what I have to tell you.
palm reader,"I see two men, brothers. Not in blood but in bond. I see the letters S and an L, no... wait, a J."
43b.,51   CONTINUED:  I see madness. A man driven out of his mind by a malign force.
palm reader,"I see a letter... the letter M... another M... Mary? You will be married... I see... I see...  Patterned table clothes, china figurines, lace doilies..."
watson,You think you are clever don't you?
palm reader,She turns to fat...
watson,Enough.
holmes, Do you have any changes?
watson,This is a new low -- even for you.
44.,"51   CONTINUED:                                                51 HOLMES It's the most honest prediction old Flora has made in years. And you know it yourself, Watson. That is precisely the reason you can't find a suitable ring. You're terrified of a life without the thrill of the macabre, as well you should be."
watson,Do you still have my cut from the fight?
holmes,"Why, do you --"
palm reader,"I seen something in his hand. Darkness and great pain. Mortal peril. Warn your friend, he's not safe."
watson,"Not bad, eh?"

holmes,"Looks promising. And possibly dangerous. Oh, well, give my regards to Mary."
watson,I can spare ten minutes.
holmes,He clearly felt something was coming to get him.
watson,Something did.
watson, Bloody hell...
holmes, Ammonium sulfate.
holmes, Phosphorous... Formaldehyde... Hemlock...
watson,Appears he was attempting to follow occult formula with scientific practice.
watson,Has he any hydrochloric acid?
47.,"56   CONTINUED:                                                      56 Holmes shuffles a few bottles, tosses one to Watson. Watson catches it, starts pouring the acid, another chemical on a clean sheet of paper."
holmes,Irene was here.
watson,"Why would she hire you to find him, if she planned to do the job herself?"
holmes,"Maybe it's not the man she's after, but something else. Something he was working on? WATSON Ferrocyanide. Sucks the iron right out of the ink. Long as it's not too burnt..."
watson,He worked for Blackwood.
holmes,"There's one odor I can't put my finger on. Sweet, almost like perfume... or sugar....  Barley sugar."
48.,"58   CONTINUED:                                                     58 They are followed by DREDGER, a huge man, just shy of seven feet tall and pushing 400 pounds, slightly deformed, who follows them into the room. He sucks on a twisty stick of barley sugar ."
holmes,"Hello, gentlemen."
dredger,Sherlock Holmes.
holmes,Let me guess -- you're here to extinguish any connection between the man who lived here and the man you work for? Curious you'd still be running errands for a dead man.
dredger, You do like to talk.
holmes,"You take them, I'll handle Mr. Sweet tooth."
watson,Seems about fair.
49.,58    CONTINUED:                                                 58 INT. REORDON'S LAB
watson,Holmes!
watson,I haven't slept all night. I deserve this... I clearly deserve it. How could I ever be so deluded as to believe I could meet Mary's parents for tea once I let myself be talked into going with you. Now of course I'm in jail.
holmes," You're not implying that I am responsible for our current situation are you, Watson? We were set upon, man, it was self- defense."
watson,I've used the time to review my notes on our exploits of the last seven months... and I've come to the conclusion that I must be suffering from to some profound psychological aberration.
54.,67   CONTINUED:                                                   67 WATSON  Why else would I continually allow myself to be led into situations where you're deliberately withholding your intentions from me?
holmes,You've never complained about my methods before.
watson,"I'm not complaining... I never complain... I never complain about your violin playing at three in the morning, your mess, your lack of hygiene, your stealing my clothes, your setting our home on fire!"
holmes,That was an accident...
holmes,The first time WAS an accident...
holmes,"Ah, Mr. Brownlee. The fifteenth most dangerous man in London."
watson,"Who could forget that face? I told you, a little nitrate of silver and the warts will be gone in two weeks. Now, if you'll excuse us!"
54a.,67   CONTINUED:  Nor am I complaining about the fact that you terrorize my patients and perform outlandish experiments on my dog.
holmes,Gladstone's my dog as well.   It's in the interest of science.
watson,What I do take issue with is your ruthless campaign to sabotage my relationship with Mary.
holmes,"Watson, I completely understand now. You're overtired and feeling a bit sensitive."
holmes,What you need is a rest. You and I could go out to the countryside. My brother Mycroft has a small estate near Chichester. It has marvelous grounds and a beautiful folly. We could throw a lamb on the spit.
watson,"If I were going to the country, I would be going with my future wife --"
holmes,Certainly. We should have her along. Let's get Gladstone out of the house as well.
watson,"No, Holmes. Not you.   Me and her. You're not --"
holmes,"Invited? Now you're not making any sense, Watson. Why would I not be invited to my own brother's country home?"
54b.,67   CONTINUED:  ... without this.
prison guard,John Watson?   You made bail.
prison guard,Just Watson.
55.,"68   CONTINUED:                                                   68 As the door is opened, the thug blasts out backwards, having just been battered through it by Holmes."
holmes,Lestrade -- your usual impeccable timing.
lestrade,"You know, in another life, you'd have made an excellent criminal."
holmes,"And you, sir, an excellent policeman."
lestrade,Tell me you have answers.
holmes,All in good time.
lestrade,"We don't have time. I've an office full of policemen hanging crosses over their desks. A public that's working itself into a frenzy... Holmes sees a dark, strange carriage waiting, door open."
holmes,Who's this?
lestrade,Try to behave yourself. They just paid a small fortune to bail you out.
sir thomas,"Mr. Holmes, apologies for summoning you like this. I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to where you are, and who I am."
holmes,"As to where I am -- I was, admittedly, lost for a moment between Charing Cross and Holborn. But I was saved by the bread shop on Saffron Hill, the only bakers to use a certain French glaze on their loaves. After that, the carriage forked left, then right, a bump over the Fleet conduit -- need I go on?"
holmes,"As to who you are -- that took every ounce of my not- inconsiderable experience and skill... the letters on your desk are addressed to Sir Thomas Rotheram, Lord Chief Justice. That would be your official title. Who you realy are is another matter entirely."
56a.,"72   CONTINUED:                                                    72 HOLMES Judging by the sacred Ox on your ring, you're also the secret head of the Temple of the Four Orders -- in whose headquarters we now stand, on the northwest corner of St. James Square.  And as to the mystery -- the mystery is why you bothered to blindfold me in the first place."
sir thomas,"Yes, well, it's standard procedure, I suppose."
57.,"72   CONTINUED:                                                72 SIR THOMAS Sherlock Holmes, Ambassador Standish from America and Lord Coward, the Home Secretary."
lord coward,I suppose you already have some notion as to the -- practices of our Order?
holmes,Yes.   They're almost interesting.
sir thomas,Be as skeptical as you like -- but our secret systems have steered the world towards the greater good for centuries. The danger is that they can also be exploited for more nefarious purposes.
lord coward,"What some call the dark arts, or practical magic."
standish,"We know you're are a rationalist. We don't ask you to share our faith, only our fears."
holmes,"Fear is the more infectious condition.  In this case, fear of your own child."
holmes,"Blackwood is your son, yes? You have the same colored irises -- a rare dark green, with diamond- shaped hazel flecks -- "
58.,"72   CONTINUED:  -- plus identical outer ears, or pinna, which only pass down through the direct bloodline, which would make you either brothers, or, more likely, father and son."
sir thomas,"Very few people are privy to that information, and we want to keep it that way."
sir thomas,"He was conceived during one of our rituals. His mother wasn't my wife, but she shared our beliefs. She was a powerful practitioner. Though not enough to survive giving birth to him."
sir thomas,We were young. It was before we fully understood the powers we were dealing with.
holmes,Evidently.
sir thomas,"Death followed him wherever he went, from his birth to arms he made and sold. What family he had tended to... not survive. No one could prove anything of course, but we all knew --"
sir thomas,The boy was a curse. I didn't have the courage either to take him in or to -- 
59.,72   CONTINUED:                                              72 STANDISH All this is history. The present and future are worse.
sir thomas,"We've done our best to stop him ourselves, but it's not enough."
lord coward,His power grows daily and exponentially. His resurrection is evidence of that. What he does next will be far more dangerous --
sir thomas,-- he's going to raise a force that will alter the very course of our world. We need you to find him and stop him before he does.
lord coward,"We'll give you any assistance we can. As Home Secretary, I have considerable influence over the police.  Name your price."
holmes,"One of the great benefits of my work is that I can pick and choose my clients. I'll get him, but not for you."
holmes,"I have one last question, Sir Thomas."
sir thomas,What is it?
holmes,"If the rest of his family's dead, why are you still alive?"
irene,"If you're going to watch me take my clothes off, Sherlock, the least you can do is help me with the buttons."
irene,"To watch a lady undress without her permission is a criminal offense, Sherlock, and could get you into a lot of trouble..."
irene,So why don't you come over here and help me instead.
irene,That's better.
holmes,You can stop looking for Reardon.
irene,I knew I could count on you. 
61.,75   CONTINUED:                                                     75 HOLMES He was buried in Blackwood's tomb.
irene,Wonderful. Case closed then. Your services are no longer required.
holmes,"I can't help wondering if your employer will be as content with these results? You were uncharacteristically ill at ease in his presence. Your hand was trembling, your gaze was averted. I couldn't see his face, but I spotted chalk on his lapel. A professor perhaps?"
irene, The eye patch was a nice touch.
holmes,"But I've never known a professor to carry a gun, and on such a clever contraption."
holmes,We're not.
holmes,Tell me who you're working for and what he's after.
irene,That's nobody's business but my own.
61a.,75   CONTINUED:                                                 75 HOLMES I disagree.
irene,"You see, we are arguing."
holmes,"When a man you ask me to find ends up dead in the coffin of the most notorious murderer since Jack the Ripper and that murderer manages to return from the dead, not only is it my business, it's the business of Scotland Yard and the highest levels of the British government. They will certainly consider your reticence to be an obstruction of justice. Which in relation to a crime of this magnitude would certainly mean prison time."
irene,This wine is excellent.    You should really try some.
holmes,So what's it to be?
irene,Do we really have to decide now?
holmes,"You're in over your head this time, Irene."
62.,75   CONTINUED:                                                  75 IRENE That's better.
irene,Much better.
irene,"This is the only way it could ever work between us, Sherlock -- one in shackles, the other with the key."
irene,I've NEVER been in over my head.
holmes,How can you live like this -- always a fugitive.
irene,"But free. And on my own terms. Just like you -- well, not you at this exact moment --"
63.,"75    CONTINUED:                                                75 She pulls at the front of his trousers, throws the handcuff keys down there."
irene,-- but generally speaking.
irene,"If anyone asks, please let them know that Mr. O'Neil didn't have time to check out.  I hope you don't mind settling the bill."
irene,What were you doing consorting with a married business traveller in his hotel room is something you'll have to explain for yourself.
irene,Where's Watson when you need him?
perigrine,"Good evening, sir. Some figs and honey with a nice glass of port? I've prepared a tray."
sir thomas,"No thank you, Perigrine, I'm going to bed.  You won't let those figs go to waste, will you?"
64.,"77    CONTINUED:                                                   77 BLACKWOOD  Hello, Father..."
blackwood,You can't fight it. It comes from a power greater than yours. You can only surrender.
blackwood,I've been imagining this moment for a long time...
blackwood,"... I must admit, it's better than I thought it would be."
holmes,"Don't take this the wrong way, but might I borrow your hand?"
holmes,"Chambermaids were once such a liberal breed. Besides, she misinterpreted my intention entirely. "
65.,"78A   CONTINUED:                                                  78A HOLMES  This is why I find this modern religious fervor so troubling, there is no latitude for misunderstanding."
holmes,Faith runs riot over reason.
constable clark,"Well, it's a good thing she was offended or we'd never have found you. The inspector's been over to Baker Street himself this morning."
constable clark,"We've checked everything. No sign of a break-in. The Butler didn't hear anything. The body was in the tub, eyes wide open -- -- so that Const. Clark ends up talking to thin air."
constable clark, -- only his ring was missing.

police officer,Out of common decency.
holmes," Crime is common, logic is rare. The decent thing to do is catch the killer, not provide comfort to the corpse."
holmes,Hmm...
holmes,What is that?
police officer, Uhhhh... jasmine?
holmes,"Superb. I suspect this comes from a larger cannister. It'll either be in the pantry, high up where it's warm and dry, or in a linen closet with a vent. And, Constable, you could check the ground under the rear windows for any footprints not your own."
holmes,"Data, data, data! I cannot make bricks without clay!"

holmes,Though none of it human.
holmes,A butcher perhaps...?   What else?
holmes,"Hm -- predominantly yellow flame, but with distinct green bursts. Sulfurous. He spent lots of time around industrial work and very little around a wash basin."
holmes,Coal... river silt...
holmes,That plus the river silt and industrial slag on his trousers puts him squarely in...
watson,Nine Elms.
holmes,"Well done. Now, you didn't happen to pack the Lord's Register of members' interests, did you?"

watson,"It's endless, he's had a hand in just about everything that's not good for you."

watson,"Woolwich Arsenal... Limehouse Chemical... Queenshithe Slaughterhouse, Nine Elms!"
holmes,"That's it, Watson! This should lead us right to Blackwood."
watson,"Not us, you."

standish,"Are you mad, Coward? Have you any idea what he's capable of?"
blackwood,I am humbled. I am honored.

blackwood,"You've made policy in secret for centuries. Now, you'll make it openly."
blackwood,"The first act is a necessary one, for without death there can be no rebirth...  Are you with me?"
standish,"No, sir, we are not!  The powers he's playing with are beyond any man's control."
blackwood,They're limitless -- even death holds no sway.

89a.,"99    CONTINUED:                                                  99 IRENE  Understand that, and you'll have a happy marriage."
irene," Understand that, and you'll have a happy marriage."
holmes,I need a map of London.
holmes,"Now that you're sitting comfortably, I shall begin. My initial approach was far too narrow. When Blackwood invited me to Pentonville prison, he suggested I widen my gaze and, at minimum, I have done just that. In fact, I may well have reconciled thousands of years of theological disparity. But that's for another time. Blackwood's method is based on a ritualistic mystical system that has been employed by The Temple of the Four Orders for centuries. To fully understand this system, to get inside it, I re-enacted the ceremony we interrupted in the crypt... with a few enhancements of my own."
watson,At minimum.
holmes,My journey took me somewhat further down the rabbit hole than I had intended.
irene,"Yes, your little white tail got rather dirty."
holmes,"But I have emerged enlightened... The fraternity who silently control the Empire, share the belief with the Kings, Pharoahs, and Emperors of old that the Sphinx was a door to another dimension, a gateway to immeasurable power --"
holmes,"It is made up of four parts: The Ox, the Lion, the Eagle, and Man -- "
90a.,"102   CONTINUED:                                                 102 He points out the individual parts of the Sphinx, covering other parts with his hand. We see the Ox body, Lion paws, Eagle wings, Man's face."
holmes,"In Sir Thomas' secret chamber I found the bone of an ox, the tooth of a lion, the feather of an eagle, the hair of a man. Map!"
holmes,"Now, it is a widely held belief that within the architecture of the great cities are coded references to this system."
holmes,"Since he rose from the grave, Blackwood has killed three men. Each murder was committed at a location that has a direct connection with the Temple, therefore the System.  Reordon, the ginger midget, represents Man. We found his body here..."
holmes,"Then Sir Thomas, Master of the Temple, wore the ox ring... he died here..."
90b.,"102   CONTINUED:                                               102 HOLMES Standish was Ambassador to America, where the Eagle has been the national emblem for over a hundred years -- and not by coincidence."
holmes,The headquarters of Temple of the Four Orders where he died is here...
watson,"Man, Ox, Eagle..."
watson,And last on the list:    the Lion. Holmes scribbles on a piece of paper. Watson and Irene step closer looking at the lion's fang and then the map...
holmes,"Correspondingly, the map will tell us the location of Blackwood's final act. Right here."
irene,What is the meaning of this circle?
holmes,It is the fifth element -- the ethereal. That which can't yet be known.
91.,102    CONTINUED:                                               102 WATSON It's right in the middle of the River Thames.
irene,Police.
holmes,Ladies first.
holmes,Follow these plans.
lord coward,Lestrade?
lestrade,"Begging your pardon, m'lord, I know it's unorthodox, but Mr. Holmes has been making serious accusations about you and the order, sir."
holmes,"Oh, that solves the great mystery as to how you became inspector."
lord coward,"I have five minutes before my next engagement, why don't you regale me with your stories of conspiracies. Thank you, Lestrade, if you could wait outside."
93.,"106   CONTINUED:                                                  106 HOLMES I'm curious, Coward, did you assist Blackwood in all the murders or just the one I prevented? Very distinctive those hand-made shoes of yours, but the price of quality is the unique imprint they leave."
holmes,"Nonetheless, I confess to being completely out-matched. I could deduce very little from my investigation."
holmes,"Fortunately, there is nothing more stimulating than a case where everything goes against you. How many members of parliament do you intend to murder at noon today?  Man, ox, eagle, lion -- the lion is parliament, isn't it?"
lord coward,"Very clever. But it's not murder, Mr. Holmes. It's mercy. We are giving the weak masses a strong shepherd. Don't you see it's for their own good?"
holmes,"No, but I don't care much what you think. I simply wanted to know the location of Blackwood's final ceremony, and now you have given it to me."
lord coward,I have told you nothing.
94.,"106   CONTINUED:                                             106 A pair of handcuffs, slide across the floor to Coward's feet. He looks up and Holmes is nowhere to be found. Coward quickly moves across the room to lock the door."
94a/94b.,106   CONTINUED:  Both Houses met today. The entire government will be present.
lord coward,"How terrible is wisdom, Holmes, when it brings no profit to the wise.  We take power at noon."
holmes,"Well there's no time to waste then, is there?"
95.,107   CONTINUED:                                                   107 Holmes looks in the water and sees a rope trailing on the surface. He grabs it with his hands. And... it pulls him closer to the rickety boat of Captain Tanner.
tanner," I told you he'd be coming out the top window, soldier boy. No way he'd be coming over the terrace."
watson,How was Lestrade?
holmes,"Performed his role perfectly.   A little too perfectly, come to think of it."
watson,"Well, your instructions were fairly precise... about everything except the window."
irene,"Where to, Sherlock?"
holmes,"Port side, Captain Tanner, into the sewers."
holmes,"Watson, did you bring my clothes?"
96.,"107    CONTINUED:                                               107 Then Holmes reaches inside a pocket of clothes he is still wearing, and pulls out the hip FLASK that he took from the men at the slaughterhouse. He takes a shot."
irene,"Starting early, aren't we?"
holmes,"Trust me, have a drink."
watson,What are we doing in the sewers?
holmes,"Patience, Doctor. I am about to show you..."
tanner,Far as I can go.
97.,"110   CONTINUED:                                                 110 Holmes ducks around a corner, stops. Irene and Watson flank him, standing in shadows. They look down a long tunnel to:"
holmes,"Behold, Blackwood's magic."
holmes,"A chemical weapon. The first of its kind. Cyanide, to be precise."
watson,You can tell that from here?
holmes,No.   I can tell it from here. He pulls something out of his pocket:    the RAT TAIL.
holmes,"I snipped this off a rather recumbent rat at the slaughterhouse. Note the blue discoloration, the faint smell of bitter almonds. Tell-tale signs of cyanide."
holmes,"That shaft leads directly to Parliament. When activated, those electrodes on either side will send a charge converting the cyanide powder into a gas."
irene,All of the people inside that building --
watson,Will be dead at the strike of noon. 
98.,110    CONTINUED:                                                110 HOLMES As if by magic. There will be no one left to stop Blackwood and his followers from assuming control.
holmes,Seven minutes to twelve...
holmes,I wouldn't.
watson,I'll keep these under wraps.
99.,112   CONTINUED:                                                  112 HOLMES Take this.
watson,Over there.
irene,I've never seen anything like it.
holmes,There's never been anything like it. A totally wire-free weapon. He must have some kind of remote device sending a signal to the receiver. Really quite --
100.,"112   CONTINUED:                                               112 Irene shoots one point blank with her Derringer, Holmes crushes the other's larynx."
holmes, Keep at it.
lord coward,Look.
101.,114   CONTINUED:                                                 114 IRENE  Nine strokes left.
watson,You owe me for the ring.
holmes,"Give me your gun. The bullets, I need the bullets."
102.,114    CONTINUED:                                                114 -- which shatters against the floor.
holmes,"We need a light, a match --"
irene,"Got it... Which is when a blood-maddened Dredger thunders into them both, arms wide, driving Holmes and Irene away from the device --"
irene, Three.
103.,116    CONTINUED:                                                  116 ON THE DEVICE AS IT GOES ACTIVE
irene,Two!
104.,"117    CONTINUED:                                                   117 BLACKWOOD You seem surprised. Did you really take me for a man who could be dispatched like a truculent servant? I see before me a conspiracy of arrogant old men puffed up by the illusion of their own vainglory. In your hands this once great parliament has become nothing more than a drunken satyr, stumbling about the world's stage seeking nothing more than to satiate your own lust and gluttony; your britches stained by the incontinence of your hypocrisy. I will not sit idly by and watch you violate the innocence of the public trust as you drag this great Empire into the quagmire that your pride has dug and filled with the excrement of your corruption. I am here to change all this."
irene,That was something new for us.
holmes,Yes... it was.
irene,Watson --
105.,"118    CONTINUED:                                                   118 Holmes whips around -- sees Watson, seemingly dead. He goes to him, drops to his knees next to Watson, feels for a pulse."
watson,I'm pretty sure I heard the last chime.
holmes,"Yes, we made it. Just."
holmes,"Come on, you've got to admit, you're going to miss this."
watson,Which part? The stench of the sewers or the broken bones?  My ankle's done.
watson,Where's Irene?
watson,"Holmes, I'm sorry..."
holmes,Make sure Lestrade keeps it intact.
110a.,"119H   CONTINUED:                                             119H Blackwood is DRAGGED down the walkway by the weight of the falling plank, pulled toward the edge."
holmes,"The simplest involved paying people off, like the prison guard..."
110b.,"119H   CONTINUED:  Like all great performers you saved your piece de resistance for the end. Had it worked, your followers in Parliament would have watched unharmed as their colleagues were dying around them. They didn't know that you had given them the antidote -- at one of your ceremonies I suspect. Instead, they would have believed it was magic and that you harnessed the ultimate power."
111.,"119H   CONTINUED:                                             119H Blackwood struggles to hold on, he loses his grip for a second and is dragged back toward the precipice. Wind whips harder."
holmes,You hated your father and the other members of the Temple of the Four Orders for what they did to you. How satisfying it must have been to use their own system against them.
blackwood,"Cut me loose, Holmes!"
holmes,You better hope that it's nothing more than superstition as you performed all the rituals perfectly.
113.,"119H   CONTINUED: . He snatches the DIAMOND from around her neck, turns and walks away. She smiles, calls out:"
irene,"You'll miss me, Sherlock."
lestrade,It'll be a hell of a trick if Blackwood comes back from this one.
holmes,"Thank you, Lestrade."
lestrade,Now you're going to be even more arrogant and insufferable than ever.
lestrade,"You're welcome, detective.  Is the woman up there?"
holmes,She won't be by the time your boys get there.
watson,One moment.
watson,Please make sure this one is put on the desk in the front room.
mary,What's in all those notebooks?
watson,Nothing really... Just a few scribbles... cases we've worked on over the years.
mary,All your adventures... I'd love to read them sometime.
mary,Do you think he's finally come to terms with you leaving?
watson,Of course.    No question about it --
115.,"123B   CONTINUED:                                             123B HOLMES I managed it with braces, belts and a coat hook. Please, Watson, my tongue is going next. I'll be of no use to you at all."
watson,Worse things could happen.
116.,123B   CONTINUED:                                             123B Watson feels for a pulse in his dog's neck -- he shakes his head. They are interrupted by a knock on the door. Constable Clark enters.
constable clark,"Mr. Holmes... Inspector Lestrade asks that you come with me, right away."
holmes,"What is it this time, Clarky?"
constable clark,"It's one of our sergeants, sir. He went missing in the sewers, the day you stopped Lord Blackwood... Well, a maintenance man found his body this morning. We believe the sergeant was our first man on the scene. Shot in the head."
116a.,"123B   CONTINUED:                                               123B CONSTABLE CLARK The secret service has it, sir. They've taken over the case."
sergeant,"Oi, what you doing?"
holmes,Were there powder burns on his eyebrows?
constable clark,He was shot at point-blank range.
watson,"There's a brave boy... There, there, everything's going to be all right."
holmes,Where is Blackwood's device now?
constable clark,"The secret service has it, sir. They've taken over the case."
watson,I'd wager there's a piece missing.
holmes,"Wager, Watson... I thought those days were behind you. Excellent deduction, however."
117a.,126   CONTINUED:                                                  126 WATSON Moriarty was after the machine not the poison.
holmes,Blackwood's wire-free invention was the game all along. It is undoubtedly the more dangerous and the more valuable of the two...  Irene was just a diversion.
man," I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir."
watson,Well...
holmes,I'll walk out with you...
holmes,"An honor working with you, Doctor."
watson,"Take care of yourself, Holmes."
mary,Try not to be too late for dinner with my parents and... be careful.
holmes,"Magnificent woman, Watson. Magnificent!"
