narrator," No one would have believed in the early years of the21st century, that our world was being watched by intelligences greater than our own. That as men busied themselves about their various concerns, they observed and studied. Like the way a man with a microscope might scrutinize the creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro about the globe, confident of our empire over this world. Yet, across the gulf of space, intellects, vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded our plant with envious eyes. And slowly and surely, drew their plans against us."
sal, Ray!! Ferrier! Whoa!
sal, I need you back at 4:00 instead of 12:00 I got half of Korea coming in.
ray," No, no, no I can't. I'm on a 12 hour blow! Call Tadesko."
sal, Tadesko can't move 40 containers in an hour. I need somebody who can do double picks.
ray, I wish I could help you Sal. God damn union regulations.
sal,"  Come on, I'm in a position here!"
ray," Come on, you remember the union regulations, Sal."
sal,  You know what your problem is?
ray,  I can think of a couple of women who'd be happy to tell you.
ray, Is it 8:30? We say that?
ray,"  Hey, this is one safe looking vehicle you got yourself here Tim. Congratulations."
tim, Thank You.
ray, 8 o'clock huh?
mary ann," Um-Huh. We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday, depending on the traffic."

ray," Really, I got it from here, okay?"
ray,  It's a 302 V8. It's gonna be out of here next week.

ray, I don't hear any complaints.
mary ann," No, I do."
mary ann, Robbie's got a paper...  ...on the French occupation of Algeria due Monday which he's yet to begin. It would be nice if he were done by the time we got back so we don't have to keep him up all night on Sunday.
robbie, I just got to type it up. 
mary ann," No, you just got to start writing it first."
robbie,  I love you mom!
mary ann, I love you.  Listen to your father.
mary ann," Oh, no shoes on the bed."
mary ann," We'll be at my parent's house in Boston but don't call the house line, because you know. Well the point is I've got my cell phone. So if anything comes up, or if you have any questions just call."
ray," Believe it or not, I can handle it."
mary ann, I'll leave the phone on.
ray, Mary Ann?  It's a good look for you.
mary ann, You think?
ray, Yeah.
mary ann, Take care of our kids.

robbie," Yeah, I'm almost finished, I just got to type it up."

robbie," Yeah, and what do you know Ray?"
ray," Everything. Haven't you heard? Between me and my brother, we know everything."
rachel, What's the capital of Australia?
ray, That's one my brother knows.
robbie, Is it okay with you if I just laugh the first 500 times you tell that one.
ray, Just do your report. We don't send you to school so you can flunk out.
robbie," You don't pay for it, Tim does."
ray, That's half of what I've got.
robbie, You're an asshole. I hate coming here.
ray, That why you act like such a dick?
ray, What?
rachel, That's not how you're going to get through to him. You want him to listen to you...

rachel, Where are you going?
ray, To sleep. I work for a living.
rachel, What are we supposed to eat?
ray," You know, order."

rachel, I got a splinter.
ray, Where'd you get it. Come here.
rachel, On your porch railing.
ray," What, you want me to...  You want me to take that out for you?"
rachel, Absolutely not!
ray," Well, come here let me see it."
ray, It's gonna get infected.
rachel, No it wont.
ray," Yes, it's gonna get infected."
rachel," No, it won't. When it's ready, my body will just push it out."
ray, Push it out?
rachel, I read that.  You should get TiVo. Tim got it for my room. It's awesome. I can watch all my shows after homework.
ray," Yeah, I'll just put that on my platinum card. Robbie?  Robbie?"
ray,  What is that?
rachel, Hummus.
ray, Hummus?
rachel, From the health food place. I kept one of their menus last time we were here.
rachel," Uh, you said order!"
ray,  I meant order food! Where is Robbie?
rachel, He went out.
ray, Out where?
rachel, I don't know. He just took your car and left.
friend 1, You ever see something like that?
ray,"  In the springtime maybe. Not this time of year. Come on, we can see better from the back yard."
ray, That is so weird.
friend 2, What?
ray, The wind is blowing toward the storm.
friend 2, That is weird.
ray," Rachel, wanna see something cool?"
ray, It's okay.
rachel, I want to go inside.
ray, It's okay.
rachel, I want to go inside.
ray," Okay, you go ahead."
friend 2, That's enough weather for me. 
rachel, I don't want to go by myself.
ray," Kind of fun, ain't it?"
rachel, No.
ray," Oh, Come on. It's like the fourth of July."
rachel, No it's not.
ray, It's okay. You're fine.
rachel, It hit right behind our house.
ray," Yeah, well it's not gonna hit there again because lighting doesn't strike twice in the same place."
ray," Oh, SHIT!"
rachel, Where's Robbie?
ray, I don't know.
rachel, Is Robbie okay?  Are you okay?
ray, Where's the thunder?
rachel, Why won't it stop?
rachel,  Is it over?
rachel, Where are you going?
ray," Just checking things out. Just wait, wait there."
rachel, Are we going to be okay?
ray, I don't know.
rachel, You don't know.
ray," No. I meant... Rachel, please, just stop asking so many questions. Just wait here."
friend 2, You believe this Ray? Every single car.
ray,"  Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus."
robbie, The car just stopped and...
ray,  You're okay? Are you okay?
robbie, ... and the lighting started hitting about a block away over and over again. And me and this other guy we...
ray,  Where the hell'd you go?
robbie, Over on Lincoln Avenue.  ... by the church.
ray, Did you see it? Did you... Were you near it?
robbie, Yeah. 26 times we counted! Over and over the lighting started hitting. It opened up this hole or something...
ray, 26 times?
robbie, Yeah.
ray," Okay, well, you're okay?"
robbie, Yeah.
ray," Good, because your sister is in the house, I want you to go in that house and I want you to stay with her. Okay?  And the next time you take my car with no driver's license and no permission, I call the cops. You better be there when I get back."
ray, Robbie. 
ray," Manny! Manny! Hey Manny. What is it, dead?"
manny," All of them, everything, look at this...  starter's fried."
ray, Lightning hit it?
manny, Not even close. I thought if I changed it... you got any idea what's going on?
ray, I'm on my way to find out. Try umm... try changing the solenoids.
manny," Right,  Right see, I told you that, the solenoids."
cop 1, Let us through. Let us through here.
friend 3," Hey, what up, Ray?"
ray,  I should of known you two were behind this.
friend 3," Hey, god's pissed off at the Neibor hood"
ray, Can you blame him?
friend 4, You see it?
ray," Yep, you got power where you are?"
friend 3," Nope, nothing."
ray, It's the cars though. That's the thing.
friend 4," Solar Flare, that's what this guy told me."
ray, A solar flare?
friend 4," Yeah, the sun shoots off blobs of plasma, they turn into solar flare flashes. It's the only thing that can kill all of the electronic stuff."
friend 3, Can I say something?
friend 4, What bro?
friend 3," The sun does not cause lightning, okay?"
friend 4," Bro, I'm just telling you what that guy said he heard."
friend 3, I know but it just sounds dumb saying that...
cop 1, I never seen anything like this before. That many strikes of lighting in one spot.
ray, Is this the only place?
friend 4, Is it hot?
ray, No. It's freezing.
cop 2, What is that?
ray, You feel that?
friend 3," Yeah, I feel that."
friend 4, What is it the subway?
cop 1, There's no subway here.
friend 4, PATH Train maybe?
cop 1, That can't be the water main.
cop 2, There's nothing else down there.
cop 1, The water main doesn't run through here.
cop 2," Well, there's something down there and it's moving."
friend 4, Oh my god.
friend 4," Ray, no, stay man."

ray, WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!!
rachel, Are we still alive?
ray, Down here!
ray, Were you on this plane? Are you a passenger?
ray, Are you a passenger?
news reporter, He's deaf. The shell went off right beside him. The camera on his shoulder saved his life.  You hear that Max? Your stupid camera saved your stupid life.
ray, Where were you?
news reporter," Out there in the pine barrens. We were attached to a National Guard unit, the 83rd Mechanized. They moved to one of those things around midnight. They've got some kind of shield around them. We can't see it, but everything we fire at them detonates too early before we can get close enough to cause any damage. When they flash that thing, everything lights up like Hiroshima."
ray, There's more than one?
reporter, You gotta be kidding me right?
reporter," We were feeding New York but New York went dark. So we patched over to D.C., they went down, L.A., Chicago, uplink to London. Even called the affiliates to try and get them to catch the feed, but nobody answered."
reporter," It's the same everywhere. Once the tripods start to move, no more news comes out of that area."
ray," Oh, my god!"
reporter, You ain't seen nothing yet.
ray, I saw that storm. I was right in the middle of one of those.
reporter," No, you didn't see it like this. Those machines come up from under the ground, right? That means they must have been buried there a long time ago. So who's driving the god damn things?  Watch the lightning. Watch it..... Watch the lighting....."
ray, What is that?
reporter," That is them. They come down in capsules, riding the lighting into the ground into the machines right?"
driver, You hear that? We're getting the hell out of here.
driver, Come on! Get in! Get in! Get in!
reporter, Hey. Were you on that plane?
reporter," Oh, that's too bad, it would have been a really great story."
ray, Look at me. Look at me.
ray," You keep your eyes only on me, you understand?"
ray," Don't look down, don't look around me. I'm taking you to the car and you're gonna want to look around. But you are not going to, are you?"
ray," You're doing good. You're doing good. Keep your eyes on me. We'll go right to Boston, and we're gonna see your mom."
rachel," I'm not gonna look, dad."
ray," That's a girl. That's my girl.  Okay, listen, I want you to close your eyes. Got them closed?"
rachel, Um-Huh.
ray, There you go. Keep em' closed for me.
ray," Robbie, get in."
ray, ROBBIE!! GET IN!!!
rachel, Why are you yelling?
ray,  Get in!
robbie, Why the hell aren't we on the turnpike?
ray," Because I don't want everybody to see we've got a working car.  We'll stay along the Hudson until we find an open bridge or ferry, then we're gonna cross the Hudson. Then take the back roads across Connecticut all the way to Boston."
rachel, Where is everybody?
ray," I don't know. Running, hiding, hiding in their basements."
robbie," If we had any balls, we'd go back there and find one of those things and kill it."
ray," Yeah, well, why don't you just let me make the big decisions, okay?"
robbie, Which would be when? Never Ray? Never's about your speed.
rachel," Okay, enough Robbie!"
ray,"  Okay! Enough with the Ray shit!! It's dad, sir, or if you want Mr. Ferrier. That sounds a little weird to me but you decide."
rachel, Dad?!?!
ray," Yes, Rachel."
rachel, I have to go to the bathroom.
ray, Really?
robbie, Come on.  I gotta go!
ray," Not so fast, not so fast, all right? Now, there are two things we have to watch out for, and the second is people who might want our car."
robbie, There's nobody around!
rachel, I gotta go.
ray, 
rachel, I'M NOT GOING IN FRONT OF YOU GUYS!
ray," All right, then just go where I can see you!"
rachel, ARE YOU CRAZY?? DON'T LOOK!!
ray, I'm not gonna look! JUST STAY IN SIGHT!!
rachel, THAT'S LOOKING!!
ray," Listen. Every time you don't listen to me, I'm telling your mother, okay? I'm making a list.  I'm making a list!"
ray, I told you to stay where I could see you!
rachel, I'm sorry!
robbie, STOP!! DO YOU HAVE ROOM??? STOP!!!

harland," Think about it.    ...    They defeated the greatest power in the world in a couple days. Walked right over us. ....    And these are only the first, they'll keep coming. This is not a war any more than there's a war between men and maggots. This is an extermination."

harland,"  I been around death plenty. Drive an ambulance in the city. Well, drove and ambulance in the city. That's all over now, huh?    ....   You know the people who make it Ray? The ones that don't flatline before the hospital? It's the ones who keep their eyes open, keep looking at you, keep thinking. ....    There the ones who survive... ....   We can' t loose our heads Ray.   ....   Running, that's what'll kill you.    ......     I'm dead set on livin'."

ray, Stay right there!
ray, I have a daughter! Why did you bring us here?
harland," To fight 'em together, Ray.   .... Now we'll be the ones coming up from underground. When the time is right, we'll take 'em by supries, the way they took us. We'll take 'em by surprise."
harland," We're right under their feet, Ray. Right here, under their feet."

harland,"  What exactly is your plan, Ray? I know what I'm gonna do. How about you? You gonna sit here, wait for them to come get you? Is that your plan?"
harland," Maybe you want to get caught. Couple of days hiding in a basement too much for you, I bet. You'll probably turn yourself right in!"
ray, Listen. It stopped.
harland,"  Maybe you'll be okay. Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll train you as their pet. You know, train you, feed you, teach you how to do tricks..."

They were undone, destroyed, after all of man's weapons and devices had failed, by the tiniest creatures that God and his wisdom, put upon this earth. At the toll of a billion deaths, man had earned his immunity, is right to survive among this planet's infinite organisms.
