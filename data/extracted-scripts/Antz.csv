Speaker,Dialogue
motivational counsellor, Terrific!  You should feel insignificant!
motivational counsellor," YES!!!  You know, people ask me, ""Doctor, why are you always happy?"" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't mind that I don't matter!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?"
motivational counsellor," Z, we're part of the fastest growing species in the whole world!"
motivational counsellor,Ask me why we're so successful.
motivational counsellor,I'm glad you asked me that question!
motivational counsellor,What do you see out there?
motivational counsellor,"Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!"
motivational counsellor,"You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, ""Hey -- I'm meaningless, you're meaningless."""
motivational counsellor,Z...you need help.  Whoops!  We're gonna have to stop there.  Your minute is up!
motivational counsellor,Now back to work!  We've made real progress!  Remember -- let's be best superorganism we can be!
azteca,"Hello?!  Earth to Z!  You better snap out of it, or there's gonna be a lot of pissed off ants!"
azteca, SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
azteca,"No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets thrown away, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble."
azteca, Break's over.
azteca,"Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge."
general formica,STAIRS!
general formica,"Cut the chit-chat down there!  We've spoiled these workers, Carpenter.  They've never had it so good, and listen to them -- always grumbling and complaining..."
carpenter,"...Yes, sir."
general formica,What have they got to complain about? Three square meals a day...
carpenter,"Actually, sir, we've cut them down to three roughly rectangular meals a week."
formica,"Don't give me statistics, Carpenter. I know what I'm talking about.  DOORS!"
formica," Oil that, soldier."
queen,Ah!  General Formica.
queen,"General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...pains me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?"
formica,We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
queen,"Yes, what else?"
formica,"Please don't worry, your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know, I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority, and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively."
queen, Now -- what were we saying?
formica," I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?"
queen,"Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my good man!  I don't know what we would do without you."
carpenter," Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee."
formica,Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
bala,Well -- I thought -- since we're getting married...it might be nice if we...got to know one another.
queen,"Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General."
bala,"It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?"
formica, Wasn't she briefed?
queen, Next!
formica," I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess.  In the meanwhile --"
bala,General -- we have to talk sometime!
formica,"Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?"
carpenter,"Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now."
formica,Outstanding.  Princess...?
bala,"So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?"
formica, I declared war!
bala, Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
carpenter," Fourteen-fifty hours, sir."
formica,Duty calls!
formica,No squeak.  Outstanding!
queen, I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
bala, You did?
queen,Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
bala, Yes...he's wonderful...
bala,"Wrong?  How could anything be wrong? I'm going to marry General Formica and be a queen and have millions of babies, just like my mom.  Do I look fat to you?"
bala,The Club's so stuffy.  I want to try someplace different.
bala,The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go!
weaver, I'll be back.
aphids, Ouch!  Ouch!
bartender,Two aphid beers.
weaver,"I don't know what you're talking about, Z."
weaver,"Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes."
weaver,Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
weaver,"Z, we've known each other a long time, right?"
weaver,"And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow."
drunk scout,"Have you been to Insectopia?  Have you?  No, ya goddam larvas!  But I have...  It's Insectopia!  Insectopia!"
drunk scout,"I was cut off from my unit -- found it by mistake --  You see -- ya follow the great yellow egg, and you come to the land of red and white --"
soldiers,"You've had enough for one night! Come on, Gramps, before you get in trouble."
weaver,Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
bala,"I'm the Princess, aren't I?"
bala,And do Princesses do improper things?
bala,"Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises."
bala,"I'm just a common worker, cooling off after a rough day!"
barker," Okay, folks.  It's six-fifteen, and that means it's time to dance."
weaver," Time to cut a rug, Z!"
weaver,"Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper."
barker, And a left-right-quarterstep-back step-halfstep -- a left-right- quarterstep-backstep-halfstep -- a left-right-quarterstep-backstep halfstep --
bala,"I'm going to ask one of these mindless, primitive worker-types to dance with me!"
bala, I know.
bala,Wanna dance?
bala," I work in the palace, I don't get out much."
bala, What?
bala,Are you sure this is a real dance?
bala, Really?
bala,You're right!
bala,Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!
soldier,"Hey!  Watch your step, worker."
bala,"You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!"
bala,Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
soldier,How come you don't dance like the rest of us?
mandible,You look like a worker to me.
weaver,"Hey, lay off my little buddy!"
bala,Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
bala,Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!
weaver,"Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!"
weaver,It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
weaver, I can't think of any.
weaver,Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
weaver,"Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you..."
weaver,Wear this.
weaver," Yeah, I know."
weaver,Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection!
loud voice,ATTEN-SHUN!
formica,"First of all, let me make one thing clear.  Nobody ever won a battle by thinking for himself.  All this ""thinking"" stuff is a load of crap. If the almighty had wanted you boys to think, he wouldn't have given you huge mandibles and a brain so small you'd misplace it if it wasn't trapped inside your head."
formica," Hell, we're not an army of ants...we're one giant ant, with giant fists, and giant jaws!"
formica,"Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a food shortage.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for breakfast, we are gonna eat the enemy for lunch, and we are gonna eat the enemy for dinner!"
formica, And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
colonel,"Stow the gab there, soldier!  Let's move 'em out!"
colonel,Eyes...left!
bala, Who is that idiot?
queen,"Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!"
barbatus,"You new, kid?"
barbatus,"Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch."
barbatus,"Are you crazy, kid?  They shoot deserters!"
barbatus,"You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?"
barbatus,No -- we're going to attack the termites!
ant soldiers," We ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah!  We slaughter termites just for fun, Hurrah! Hurrah!"
barbatus," No such luck.  Those dirty terms are five times bigger than us, and they shoot acid from their foreheads!"
soldier ants,"We ants go marching two by two, hurrah!  Hurrah!  We'll all be dead before we're through, hurrah!  Hurrah!"
barbatus,Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
ant soldiers,"We ants are marching three by three, hurrah!  Hurrah!  Dead ants is what we soon will be, hurrah!  Hurrah!"
barbatus,"Superior numbers, kid!"
colonel,ATTAAAAAAAAACK!!!
barbatus,Over the TOOOOOOOOOOOOO-OP!!!
barbatus,It's too damn quiet.
barbatus,"Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back."
colonel, Light it up!
colonel,They're here!!!
barbatus, Keep your head down!
barbatus,Don't get all sappy about it!
colonel,I love the smell of formic acid in the morning.
ant officer, He's killed their Queen!
ant officer,VICTORY!!!
ant officer,Let's slaughter them all!
ant officer,INCOMING!
barbatus,"Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?"
barbatus,"No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs..."
barbatus, I wonder...what...was it all...for...
barbatus,"Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life..."
azteca,"Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?"
weaver, I'm new...I was born yesterday.
azteca,Tell me about it.
weaver,"Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --"
azteca," Mmm, yes, I see what you mean..."
foreman,What's the holdup here?!
weaver,"Sorry, sir -- I was just having a little chat with my friend --"
foreman," Who said you could have a chat? You're not a chatter, you're a digger!  So shut up and dig!"
azteca,Leave him alone!  He's new.
foreman,"You  too?  Well just for that, you lose your day's rations!  Now get back to work!"
azteca," I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy..."
weaver,"Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations."
azteca, Are you asking me out to dinner?
weaver, No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
azteca,"I'll make myself available...Listen, better watch out with the backtalk.  I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me.  I'm afraid he got... downsized."
guard ant,Look!  They're back!  The army's back!  Alert the colony!
excited ants,The army's returned!  Our brave boys are back! 
azteca,It looks like only one soldier made it back!
weaver, Poor Z -- I should never have let you go!
formica,ONE TO NOTHING!  WE WIN!
formica,"Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!"
formica,Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
azteca,"Wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's Z!"
weaver,Z?  Our Z?  The little guy made it!
formica,"Son, you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and laughs."
formica,Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  Me!
formica,Affirmative.
formica,In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
formica,"Yes, and do you know why there's a food shortage?"
formica,"Negatory.  Too many ants.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home."
formica,"I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart..."
officer, Who cares?  They're workers!
bala,"You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?"
bala,I'm Princess Bala.
bala,Yes.
queen,All these parties are so marvellously alike.
formica,They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.
formica, May I cut in?
bala," No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero."
bala,You dance...
bala,No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
bala,He was swarthy...primitive... earthy...sensual.
bala,"He was a worker.  I danced with him at a worker's bar just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?"
bala," OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A WORKER!!!  A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!"
bala,I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
bala, Quiet -- sshhh!!
bala,SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
formica, What's this?  A worker has been masquerading as a war hero?!
formica,ARREST HIM!
queen,Oh my god!  He's taking her hostage!
princess,This is thoroughly unacceptable!
bala,I'm coming!  I'm coming!
bala,I'm going!  I'm going'
bala,What was that thing?
bala,I order you to find out where we are!
bala,Climb up that tree and get a better view!
bala,I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
bala,How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
bala,Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
bala,"No!  There's no such thing as ""just two ants.""  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!"
bala,I -- hate -- you.
bala,Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
bala, I was slumming it!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
bala,I didn't choose him.  What kind  of idiot would...  ...choose who she wanted to marry?
bala,"Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!"
bala,"Insectopia?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!"
bala,Worker!  Come back here now!
bala,That's not a name!  That's just a letter!
bala, Z?  Z?  Wait for me!!!
azteca,"I tell ya, I'm gettin' sick of bein' yelled at."
weaver,"You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!"
azteca,That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
weaver,"Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca..."
azteca,Invisible!
weaver,No -- an individual!
weaver,"Well, it's...someone with his own point of view...someone who does what he wants, not whatever he's told to do!"
azteca, Someone who follows his heart!
weaver, Right...because every ant's important!
weaver,We can all be individuals!  Just like Z!
bala,Water...water...
bala," My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life."
bala,Look out!
bala,We're going to die!
bala,Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's wrong with me?
bala," Wait, I hear something!"
bala,WATER!!!
bala,Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
bala, Out here I'm just what?
bala, Stop fooling around in there.
bala,Let me go!!!
bala, I'm going to be rescued soon.  I'm going to be rescued soon.  I'm going to be rescued soon.
bala,General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
bala,Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
bala,"Well...no, but --"
bala, Well...I am the oldest.
bala,By three seconds...
bala, You're right.  There are as many Princesses...as there are blades of grass.
formica,"Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford any delays on this project!"
carpenter,"I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!"
worker ants,Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!
foreman, Where do ya think you're going?  Get back to work!
formica,"Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?"
carpenter,"Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?"
formica, No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
formica,So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
weaver,"Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir."
formica," Well now you haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?"
weaver,"Oh, no, sir!"
formica,Good.  You're a good soldier.
weaver,"Thank you, sir."
formica,So tell me.  Where's Z?
weaver,"I...I have no idea, sir."
formica,"Okay, son."
formica,"We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No single ant matters, right?"
weaver," That's correct, sir!"
formica, Or that one.
weaver,"No, sir!"
formica," Or that one?  Her life doesn't matter, does it?"
azteca,"Don't tell that tightass anything, Weaver!"
weaver,"Wait!  Just let her go!  Z's long gone anyway, following some golden egg to Insectopia!  You'll never catch him!"
formica,"Insectopia, hunh?...See why individuality is so dangerous?  It can always be used against you.  If this sissy here wants to dig, he'll dig.  Send them both back to the tunnel project.  Double their workload."
formica,"What do we have on this ""Insectopia""?"
carpenter,"Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable."
formica,Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
carpenter, Ant Team Six...
bala," I swear, we've passed this blade of grass three times."
bala,"Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess..."
bala," What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire..."
bala," Z, it's beautiful!"
male wasp," You down there, haven't you ever been to a picnic?"
female wasp,Habla Ingles?  Well I really don't know who they are.
male wasp,"Poopsie, we know some ants, don't we?  Are you related to the Fifth Avenue ants?"
female wasp,"Darling, do you have to talk to any insect from off the street?"
male wasp,"Just being friendly, Poopsie."
bala,"Hello?  I'm not just ""any insect"". My mother is the Queen.  I'm Princess Bala!"
male wasp," They're Eurotrash, dear."
male wasp,"Lunch!  A little piece of advice, sport -- bob and weave!  Bob and weave!"
bala,What do you mean?
male wasp,Well -- like my father used to say -- there's no such thing as a free meal!
the wasps,Excuse me -- I'll have some potato salad -- thank-you! -- don't mind if I do!  After you! 
bala,Oh...my...God.
male wasp, Muffy!  Muffy!  Wake up!
male wasp, WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY????
bala,MMMffllmmm...
bala,Z!  Help me!!!
bala,Z!!!  Get me out of heeeeere!
bala,Z!!!!!!!  I'm stuck!
bala,Z!  You're here!
bala, Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
bala,This is all your fault!!!
major mandible,"And don't come back, you sissy!"
mandible,Talk to me.
commando ant,"Z and the Princess were here, sir. Signs of a struggle."
mandible,Let's get a read on that feremone track.
tracker ant,Bala...find Bala...
tracker ant, Nnononononononoyeahyeahnononononono no...
mandible,"Z -- you dirt-digging, fancy-dancing, wisecracking, royalty-grabbing, rebel SCUM!  I AM COMING FOR YOU!  YOU ARE ONE DEAD ANT, MISTER!"
mandible,"Let's MOVE!  GO, people!  GO!  GO! GO!  GO!  GO!"
bala,"Come on, Z."
fly,What's with the bummer attitude?
butterfly,Yeah -- nobody stresses out in Insectopia!
bala,Did you say...
bala," Z, we made it!"
fly, C'mon in!  The nectar's fine!
fly," Hey, take it easy!  There's nothin' to be afraid of!"
cricket,"Dude, here in Insectopia, we don't judge people by how many arms and legs we've got."
fly,"Yeah, back home, they called me a fruitfly.  But here, I'm known as...  Superfly."
cricket,"Anyway, big Gus is mellow."
bala,"Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess."
bala,You held onto this all that time?
beetle,Hey Z!
beetle,"Wanna bring back dessert?  There's a thirty foot long blimp in the next can, made completely of chocolate!"
tracker ant,Yesyesyesyesyes --
mandible,Talk to me.
mandible,Let's move in.
cricket,"What if, like...we're just these tiny little things, and we're just like part of this whole other huge universe, that's like, so big we don't even know it exists?"
ladybug,Man...that's so deep...
mandible,EVERYBODY DOWN!
mandible,"Alright, you hippy scum!  Make one move and I'll exterminate you!"
bala,Stop!  You don't understand!
mandible,"I don't have to understand, Missy -- I've got orders.  Now where's Z?"
fly,"Man, your girl is fly, know what I'm saying?"
ladybug,Bala's been kidnapped!  Some flying ants took her back to the colony!
male wasp,I know what it's like to lose someone...I keep hearing the sound of Muffy's flapping wings...so I'll take you.
fly,Geez.  I feel like a real stinkbug.
male wasp,Sorry.  Turbulence.
formica,Princess Bala.  Good.  Where's Z?
bala,He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
formica, It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
bala,Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
formica, You miss him?  Why?
bala," Because...because he's twice the ant that you are.  I could never go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an individual, and when I get married, it'll be to someone I choose."
formica," Princess Bala, I'm just a simple old soldier, and the ways of the feminine mind are a little too complex for me. But one thing I do know is, there are more Princesses where you came from. I just hope they're not all like you. In the meantime, maybe we can arrange for you to see Z again after all."
male wasp,"Good luck, Z.  For a wingless insect, you're alright by me."
soldier ant,You there!  Worker!
soldier ant,"What are you doing out here!  All workers are to remain inside the colony, by orders of General Formica!"
queen,"Very impressive, General."
mandible,"Wave that flag, you maggot!"
formica,"Is there anything wrong, your majesty?"
queen,It's just...How I miss Bala.  I wish she were here for this special moment.
formica," She is, your majesty.  She is."
tracker ant, Z!  Z!  I smell Z!
tracker ant, Bala!  Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah!  Find Bala!  Yeahyeahyeahyeah!
tracker ant,Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah...
tracker ant,Bala...Yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah...
bala,Z!  You came back!
bala,"There's something going on, Z --"
bala,They're having a ceremony to open the Megatunnel...
bala,Oh no...
bala,Z!  what are you doing?
bala, Z!!! Wait for me!
formica,"Your majesty, I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony."
queen,But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
formica,"'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty."
queen,"Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!"
formica,"Alright, let's move out!"
queen,"In the name of the colony, I declare this tunnel open!"
queen,Bala!
bala,Mom!
weaver,Yes he is.
workers,Hey...it is Z...listen to what he says! [etc].
weaver,Z...I'm so sorry!  I --
queen, Oh...it's that social-climbing worker again -- what does he want?
mandible, Let 'er rip!
azteca,Listen!
queen,You there!  Stop!  I say!
azteca,There's no way out!
queen,We're all going to drown!!!
bala,Z...what can we do?
weaver,You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
worker,He did it!  Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!  Z!
formica,"Z.  I should have known.  All that work, all that preparation, come to nothing.  All because of one stinking ant."
formica,ALRIGHT.  WHICH ONE OF YOU IS Z?
formica,"WHAT ARE YOU, DEAF?  I ASKED YOU, WHERE'S Z?"
formica,"Folks, you may have survived that flood, but there's no way you're gonna escape from me.  I'll make you a deal.  Hand over the rebel leader Z, and you survive."
formica,"But if you don't hand him over, you're all going to die, each and every single...""individual"" one of you."
formica,"What shall it be, workers?"
formica,Have it your way.
weaver,"No, I'm Z."
azteca,I'm Z!
bala,"No, I'm Z."
workers,I'm Z!  I'm Z!  I'm Z and so is my brother!  I've been Z for weeks now!
queen, We are Z.
all,I am Z!  I am Z!  I am Z!
formica,ATTACK!
fly,"Hey, guys!"
wasp,It's them!
wasp,"Are these hooligans giving you trouble, Z?"
fly,"Say the word, Z, and we kick their butts."
formica,"What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!"
carpenter,"Uh, actually, we are outnumbered sir..."
formica,AHHHHHHH!!
formica,Please...I...I can't swim...Help me...
formica,I guess it does...to the ant.
carpenter,"Sir, if it's any consolation, I still think you're completely worthless as an individual."
bala,A few?
