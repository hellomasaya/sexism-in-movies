Speaker,Dialogue
second draft,5/22/07
coach,"It's that terrorist, Mandela. They let him out.  Remember this day, boys. It's the day our country went to the dogs."
linga,Here he comes. Like clockwork.
jason,It makes him such an easy target.
jason," I see you, father."
mandela, Morning boys. How are you?
jason,"We're sharp, Madiba."
mandela,"Good ... good. And how's your mother doing, Linga?"
linga,"She's much better, thank you."
mandela,Good.
jason,What does it say?
mandela,"It says, ""He can win an election, but can he run a country?"""
linga, Not even one day on the job and they're after you.
mandela,It's a legitimate question.
tv announcer,-- with white fears.
pienaar,"Thanks, ma."
jason," After you, Mr. President."
mandela,Good morning everybody.
mandela,"Barbara, good morning. You've had your hair done. I like it."
barbara,"Thank you, Madiba. We need to talk about your cabinet appointments and ministers."
mandela,"Give me one moment, please."
mandela,BARBARA --
mandela,-- please assemble the staff for me. Whoever has not already left.
barbara,Right now? All of them?
mandela,"Yes, please."
mandela,"I'd like you to stay out here, please."
jason,"But, Madiba ..."
mandela,I cannot talk to them if I'm hiding behind men with guns.
mandela, Gooie more almal.
staff member, Does he think greeting us in Afrikaans makes this any sweeter?
mandela,Some of you may know who I am.
mandela,Good morning ... how are you ... thank you for coming at such short notice ... etc.
mandela,I couldn't help noticing the empty offices as I came to work today. And all the packing boxes.
mandela,"Now, of course, if you want to leave, that is your right. And if you feel in your heart that you cannot work with your new government, then it is better that you do leave, right away."
mandela,"But if you are packing up because you fear that your language, or the color of your skin, or who you served previously, disqualifies you from working here now, I am here to tell you, have no such fear.  Wat is verby is verby. What's past is past. We look to the future, now."
mandela,"We need your help. We want your help. If you would like to stay, you will be doing your country a great service."
mandela,"I ask only that you do your jobs to the best of your abilities, and with good hearts. I promise to do the same.  If we can manage that, our country will be a shining light in the world."
jason,"He wants to win them over, one damn boer at a time."
jason,"Molo, sister."
jessie, It's still morning?
jason,"When you get a chance, can we see the schedule for the month? We need to plan security."
jessie," Office of the President, good morning."
jason,We need more men.
linga,Did you talk to Barbara about it?
jason,Yesterday.
jason,"That's Jessie, with the schedule.  Come in, beautiful."
jason,What is this?
etienne,Mr. Jason Tshabalala?
jason,That's me. Am I under arrest?
etienne,"Captain Van Eck and team reporting for duty, sir."
jason,What duty?
etienne,We're the Presidential bodyguard. We've been assigned to this office.  Here are our orders.
linga," You're Special Branch, right?"
etienne,You'll see that they've been signed.
jason,I don't care if they're signed or --
jason,Wait here.
jason,Sorry to disturb you.
mandela,"You look agitated, Jason."
jason,That's because I've got four Special Branch cops in my office.
mandela,What have you done?
jason,Me? Nothing. They say they're the Presidential bodyguard. They have orders.  Signed by you.
mandela,"Yes. They've had special training, those boys -- with the SAS. And lots of experience. They protected De Klerk."
jason,"Yes, but --"
mandela,"You asked for more men, didn't you?"
jason,"Yes, but --"
mandela,"In public, when people see me, they see my bodyguards, too. You represent me, directly. The rainbow nation starts here.  Reconciliation starts here."
jason,"Reconciliation? Madiba, not long ago they tried to kill us! Maybe even these four guys. They tried and, often, they succeeded!"
mandela,"Yes, I know.  Forgiveness starts here, too."
mandela,"Forgiveness liberates the soul. It removes fear. That is why it is such a powerful weapon, Jason. "
jason,"Yes, Madiba. Sorry to disturb you."
barbara,You ask a lot.
mandela,Only what is necessary.
jessie,Two copies of the schedule.
jessie,"Thank you, Jessie!"
linga,"Can we get rid of these guys, now?"
jason,This is his schedule for the next month. Let's look it over for duty assignments.
etienne,Right.
linga,What?
linga,"Jason, I have to talk to you. Outside."
linga,"How can we trust them? JASON We can't.  This is what Madiba wants, okay."
etienne,Are there any special orders or conditions?
jason,No. Yes. Madiba gets upset if you don't smile when you push people out of the way.
hendrick,Seriously?
linga,"Yes, seriously. It's the new South Africa."
etienne,Madiba?
jason,The President's clan name. It's what we call him.
etienne,We'll call him Mr. President.
jason,Let's get through this.
etienne,How's he going to do all this? When does he take a break?
linga,He says he rested enough in prison.
jason,Here's a headache.
linga,What?
jason,A rugby match at Loftus Versfeld. British Lions against the Springboks.
hendrick,"It's going to be a headache for the Lions, that's for sure. We're going to donder them."
jason,I don't care about the game. I care that the President'll be so exposed.
linga,To thousands of drunken --
etienne, -- sports fans?
jason,Yes. Sports fans.
linga,Who didn't vote for him. Who probably hate him. Who came out of the womb with guns in their hands.
jason," I want your eyes on the crowd at all times. We're staying in the middle of the field. He's going to walk out, shake hands, walk back. Nothing else. Got it?"
jason,Here we go.
mandela,"Good luck, captain."
pienaar," Thank you, sir."
jason, Stay with him.
etienne,Stop him.
jason,Stay with him.
mandela,Thank you for honoring our new flag!
jason,"We're delaying the rugby, Madiba."
mandela,"Oh, yes, of course."
etienne,Why didn't you stop him?
jason,"Next time, you try."
etienne,Does he do that sort of thing all the time?
jason,Ask my ulcer.  Good thing that was just an orange.
etienne,And good thing he never saw it.
jason,"Oh, he saw it. He sees everything.  I hate rugby."
pienaar,"Concentrate, dammit! Focus! We can beat these guys if we play our game, not theirs!"
mandela,Shall we work while we watch? We have lots of promises to keep.
barbara,"Yes, we do."
mandela,"It's not too late, if the boys can just pick up their game."
rugby president,"If they don't, heads will roll. This is unacceptable.  Come on you bloody bastards!"
barbara,"Where do you want go first, for foreign investment?"
mandela,"Where the money is. America, England, Saudi Arabia."
barbara,Do you see all the old apartheid flags? It's a disgrace.
mandela,It's also a constitutional right.
barbara,Along with the apartheid anthem. I know. But it's time people moved on.
mandela,"Look at that. The whites are cheering for the Springboks, the blacks are cheering for the Lions."
mandela,"We did that on the island, you know. We supported anyone but the `boks. It really irritated the warders."
barbara,Of course it did.
mandela,How long until the World Cup?
rugby president,About a year.
mandela,Plenty of time for improvement.
rugby president,Mr. President -- I wouldn't get my hopes up. We're a damn disgrace.
mandela,"I want to go to India and Indonesia, too."
mandela,Very badly.
mandela,Why?
boland botha,"They left 80 minutes later with their tails between their legs, like whipped mongrels.  And I, for one, am glad. Not because we lost, but because there's now no way to disguise the fact that we are completely and utterly unprepared to reenter the world of top-notch international rugby."
rugby president,Who gets the axe? Someone has to.
pienaar,He's trying to get them to drop me.
nerine,He's just bitter because the Springboks were boycotted when he played.
pienaar,"Maybe, but people listen to what he says."
mary,Here's your muti. I warmed the milk tonight.
mandela,You're too good to me.
mary,"Your daughter called, to cancel her visit this weekend."
mandela,Did she say why?
mary,"No, she didn't.  She said to tell you she was sorry."
mary,Do you need anything else tonight?
mandela,"No, thank you. I'm going to bed. Good night."
mary,"Good night, Madiba. Sleep well."
nsc firebrand,... and now for the next item on our agenda.
nsc firebrand,The NSC executive proposes a full membership vote on the following motion ...
nsc firebrand,"... that as a prominent symbol of the apartheid era, the colors, emblem and name of the Springboks be eliminated immediately ..."
nsc firebrand,... and that all sports teams representing South Africa shall be known forthwith as the Proteas.
jason,"Both units to the cars, right now."
barbara,What do I tell the Japanese trade delegation?
mandela,I delegate that decision to you.
barbara,Do you want me to inform the VP?
mandela,No.
barbara,We should at least include the Minister of Sport.
mandela,No.
barbara,I strongly advise against doing this. Especially on your own. It ... it gives the impression of autocratic leadership.
barbara,You risk alienating your cabinet and your party.
mandela,"Your advice is duly noted, Barbara."
barbara,Madiba ... the people want this. They hate the Springboks. They don't want to be represented by a team they cheered against all their lives.
mandela,"Yes, I know. But in this instance the people are wrong. And it is my job as their elected leader to make them see that."
mandela,"Can you tell the boys that Madiba wants to go to Eersterust, very fast."
barbara,You're risking your political capital. You're risking your future as our leader.
mandela,The day I am afraid to do that is the day I am no longer fit to lead.
barbara,At least risk it for something more important than rugby.
nsc firebrand,"... brothers, sisters, comrades, we in the executive applaud your diligence and courage."
nsc firebrand,"Brothers, sisters ... join us in our anthem."
choir, --
nsc firebrand,"Brothers, sisters, members of the choir -- we would only interrupt such beautiful music for something truly important. In this case, for someone truly important.  Please welcome President Mandela!"
jason, Smile.
mandela,"Brothers, sisters, comrades, I am here because I feel strongly that you made a decision today without sufficient information or foresight."
mandela,"I am aware of your earlier vote. I am aware that it was unanimous.  Nonetheless, I propose that we restore the Springboks. Restore their name, their emblem and their colors, immediately."
mandela,Let me tell you why ...
mandela,"... on Robben Island, in Pollsmoor Prison, my jailers were all Afrikaners.  And we prevailed, did we not? All of us here ... we prevailed."
mandela,"Our enemy is no longer the Afrikaner. They are our fellow South Africans, our partners in democracy."
mandela,"And they treasure Springbok rugby. If we take that away, we lose them. We prove that we are what they feared we would be. "
mandela,"Yes, I know. All the things they denied us."
mandela,But this is not the time to enjoy a moment's petty revenge. This is the time to build our nation using every single brick available to us - - even if that brick comes clothed in green and gold.
mandela, Who is with me on this?
mandela,Who is with me?
barbara,Twelve votes. Twelve! MANDELA A luxury. All we needed was one more yes than no.
barbara,What if you hadn't got it?
mandela,"Well, as you know, I am an obedient party member."
barbara,"I'm sorry, Madiba, but we've got problems everywhere we look. Housing, food, jobs, crime, our currency. You can't keep interrupting affairs of state to placate a minority."
mandela,"But, I must. This minority still controls the army, the police, and the economy. Without them, we cannot address the other problems."
barbara,"So this rugby, it's just a political calculation?"
mandela,"It's a human calculation.  If we take away what they cherish -- the Springboks, their national anthem -- we just reinforce the cycle of fear between us."
mandela,I will do what I must to break this cycle. Or it will destroy us.
angry springbok,This beer tastes like kuk.
pienaar,It's not the beer.
pienaar,Take another.  Everybody take a beer.
pienaar,A toast ...
pienaar,... to the taste of defeat.
pienaar,Drink it. Remember it. And promise yourself never to taste it again.
pienaar,You're right. It tastes like kuk.
jason,Here's the schedule for the overseas trip.
linga,What did he just say?
hendrick,I said --
etienne,He asked when we were supposed to sleep.
hendrick,As well as other basic human functions.
jason,"Hey. If Madiba can do it, we can do it."
mandela,"The millions of our people say thank you, and thank you again."
mandela,I have come here with a message. People of the Unites States of America: Open your markets to us. People of the United States of American: Come and invest in our country.
tv announcer,-- as he concluded a gruelling trip TO--
hendrick,"It's good to be home, sir."
mandela,I'm fine.
mandela,"Travelling the world, begging for money, is very tiring."
mandela,This is for you.
linga," I see you, father."
mandela,Morning boys.
hendrick,"Morning, sir."
mandela,"How is your family, Hendrick?"
hendrick,"Top shape, sir. How about yours?"
mandela,I have a very big family. 42 million people.
mandela,I don't think I want to walk today.
linga,We never ask him about his family. HENDRICK But he asks about ours all the time.
linga,"Think about it, man. He's separated from his wife. His children ... how often do you see them here?  He's not a saint, okay. He's a man, with a man's problems -- and he doesn't need us reminding him about them."
mandela,Hello Barbara. I like that dress.
barbara,Thank you Madiba.  This is for you.
mandela, What is it?
barbara,Your pay checks. You haven't been collecting them.
barbara,What's wrong?
mandela,This is terrible.
barbara,"Madiba, it's what De Klerk got. Plus an increase for inflation."
tv announcer, -- his salary is too high.
tv announcer,He has therefore decided to donate a third of his monthly income to charity.
pienaar, You would not. Not in a million years.
pienaar," Hallo, Pienaar."
pienaar," Hang on a moment, please."
tv announcer,President Mandela said that he wished to set an example to other leaders and cabinet ministers.
nerine,He knows I'd bloody kill him.
nerine,What? Who was it?
pienaar,I've been invited to tea.
nerine,Who with?
pienaar,The President.
pienaar,The President.
pienaar,"He wants me over for tea, week after next."
eunice,"Mr. Francois -- you must tell Madiba that the bus service is very bad, and too expensive. He must please fix it.  Good night everybody."
nerine,"Francois, relax. You've met him before."
pienaar,"I shook his hand on the rugby field, that's all."
nerine,You didn't even vote for him.
pienaar,He's still the President.  He's had dinner with the Queen. With Presidents and movie stars. All I do is play rugby. What if I pull something stupid in front of him?
nerine,You won't. I'll pick you up right here.
etienne,See who's coming for tea?
hendrick,My nephew wants me to get his autograph.
linga,Who?
etienne,Francois Pienaar.
jason,Who wants to escort him in?
hendrick,I will.
jason,No autographs.
hendrick," I know how to do my job, okay."
linga,Who's this Pienaar?
etienne,You can't be serious? He's the captain of the Springboks.
linga,"I like soccer, myself."
etienne,"Well, you know what they say about soccer -- it's gentleman's game played by hooligans. One the other hand, rugby is a hooligan's game played by --"
linga,"Ja, ja, I've heard it before. It wasn't funny the first time."
pienaar,"Can I ask you a question, Lieutenant?"
hendrick,"Ja, of course."
pienaar,What's he like?
hendrick,"When I worked for the previous President, it was my job to be invisible."
hendrick,"This President ... he found out I like English toffee and brought me some back, from his visit to the Queen."
hendrick,"To him, nobody is invisible."
hendrick,"That's where you wait. One of his assistants will come for you.  There's a bathroom over there, if you need it."
pienaar,Okay. Thanks.
hendrick,"What are our chances in the World Cup? I mean, for real."
pienaar,"We'll do our best. That, I can guarantee."
hendrick,"Well, he's not as big as he looks on TV.  And we don't stand a bloody chance in the World Cup."
mary,Mr. Pienaar?
mary,"This way, please."
mary,Go on in.
mandela,"Francois, what an honor. I'm so excited."
mandela,Thank you for coming all this way to see me.
pienaar,"Yes, sir. No problem. Thank you for inviting me."
mandela,Tell me. How's your ankle?
pienaar,My ankle?
mandela,I was told you'd hurt it. Has it healed?
pienaar,"The truth is, sir, you never play at a hundred percent, no matter what."
mandela,"Yes ... yes. In sports, and in life. Come. Sit. Please.  Take this one. Looking into the light hurts my eyes."
mandela,"Ah, Mrs. Brits --"
mandela,-- you are a shining light in my day.
mandela,"Mrs. Brits, this is Francois Pienaar. He's the captain of the Springboks."
pienaar," Aangename kennis, Mevrou Brits."
mandela,"No thank you, I think I'd like to."
mandela,"How do you take your tea, Francois?"
pienaar,"Milk and sugar, please."
mandela,"The English have given us many things, including rugby, but afternoon tea is one of the greatest."
pienaar,"Thank you, sir."
mandela,You have a very difficult job.
pienaar,I do? I sell gas braais.
mandela,Captain of the Springboks. A very difficult job.
pienaar,"Not compared to yours, sir."
mandela,"Ah, but then nobody is trying to tear my head off while I'm doing mine."
mandela,"It is not so difficult to get people to do their best. And I imagine that anybody who plays for their country does their best, almost automatically."
pienaar,Or they wouldn't be chosen in the first place.
mandela,Yes. But to get people to be better than that? 
pienaar,"Yes sir, it is."
mandela,"How do we do that? By example? To an extent. But there is more to it than that ...  ... inspiration, perhaps."
mandela,"How do we inspire ourselves to greatness, when nothing less will do? How do we inspire everyone around us?  Sometimes, I think, by using the work of others."
mandela,"On Robben Island, when things were very hard, I found inspiration in a poem."
pienaar,A poem?
mandela,A Victorian poem. Just words. But they helped me to stand when all I wanted was to lie down --  But you didn't come all this way to hear an old man talk about things that make no sense.
pienaar,"No! They make a lot of sense, sir.  On the day of a big match, say a test, in the bus on the way to the stadium, nobody talks."
mandela,Yes ... yes. Everybody is preparing.
pienaar,"When I think we're ready, I have the bus driver put on a song I've chosen; a theme song. One we all know. We listen together and ... it helps."
mandela,"Yes! I remember when I was a guest at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. The whole stadium welcomed me with a song.  At the time the future -- our future -- seemed very bleak. But to hear that song, in voices from all over our planet ... it made me very proud to be South African. It helped me to come home and do better. It allowed me to expect more of myself."
pienaar,"May I ask what the song was, sir?"
mandela,"Well, it was Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika. A very inspiring song."
mandela,"We need inspiration, Francois."
mandela,"Because, in order to build our nation, we all need to exceed our own expectations."
pienaar,"Yes, sir. We probably do."
nerine,So ...?
pienaar,Hm?
nerine,What's he like?
pienaar,He's ...  ... he's not like anyone I've ever met before.
nerine,Well? What did he want?
nerine,"Ag, come on Francois. It's like talking to a bloody brick wall. What did he want?"
pienaar,I think ...  I think he wants us to win the World Cup.
mandela,Excuse me.
mandela,What do you think?
zindzi,It doesn't matter what I think.
mandela,"Yes, it does."
zindzi, Okay. I think he looks like one of the policemen who forced us out of our house when you were in jail. I don't like seeing you shake his hand. And I'm not the only one.
mandela,You criticize without understanding. You seek only to address your own feelings. This is selfish thinking. It does not serve the nation.
mandela,Wait. Please. I --
mandela,Will you give this to your mother.
zindzi,What is it?
mandela,A bracelet.
zindzi,Just throw it away.
mandela,I don't have the right to. It's not mine.
zindzi,"If she left it here, she meant to throw it away."
eunice,Mrs. Pienaar said you were finished with the paper.
mandela,The Ivory Coast qualified. This is wonderful.
mandela,"According to the experts, you and I are still supposed to be in jail."
coach,Again!
mandela,A billion people watching us!  Yes ... yes. This is a great opportunity.
springbok manager,I reckon you've knocked the stuffing out of them today.
coach,I haven't even begun.  We may not be the most talented team in the world -- but we're going to be the fittest.
coach,And back! The squad can't believe their ears. No one moves. Except Pienaar.
pienaar,"Come on boys, let's show him."
springbok flank,"Shit, what's Pienaar been eating?"
mandela, Please call the head of South African rugby for me.
rugby president,"Afternoon men. It's good to see you working so hard. I have a short announcement.  As part of the PR buildup to the World Cup, you will be conducting coaching clinics in townships all over the country."
rugby president,I know you have plenty on your plates already -- but this is a request that comes from the top.  The very top.
springbok hooker,This is complete crap.
springbok flank,Are we some kind of circus act now?
springbok lock,We don't have time for kuk like this.
springbok lock,"They expect us to play our best, to give our bloody all, then they add to our bloody workload ..."
springbok lock,"What do you think about this, Chester?"
chester williams,I try not to think. It interferes with my rugby.
springbok lock,See! Now there's a rugby player. Talk to them Francois.
springbok wing,Make them see that this is a waste of time we don't have.
pienaar,I'm not going to talk to them.
springbok flank,Why not?
pienaar,"Whether we like it or not, we're more than just a rugby team. We're ... we're ambassadors inside our own country. And we might as well get used to it."
springbok lock,"Is this you speaking, or Mandela?"
pienaar,"You know me better than that.  Times change. We need to change, too."
tv announcer,"No one has claimed responsibility yet, but authorities say that the timing and target mark this as the work of white, right-wing fanatics. An act of revenge for the FBI killings in Waco, Texas."
tv announcer,"The explosive, a truck bomb, was apparently a simple mixture of commonly available industrial and agricultural materials."
tv announcer,"So far, the official death toll stands at over a 100 people, which includes at least 12 children from a day care center in the Federal building."
mandela,Please call President Clinton for me. I wish to offer him our condolences.
mandela,"Do you see why forgiveness is essential, Jason?  Revenge only begets revenge."
springbok lock,"Shit, I'm glad I don't live here."
springbok hooker,What the hell are they doing?
pienaar,"Don't forget, we've got TV cameras on us at all times."
springbok lock, What a bloody joke.
pienaar,Okay Chester -- I reckon you're up.
chester williams, What am I supposed to do?
pienaar,What you do best.
pienaar,WHO WANTS TO PLAY RUGBY? A roar. They all do.
pienaar,Let rip.
pienaar,Let's do our best.
pienaar,Go get them!
springbok hooker,Who here knows the first rule of rugby?
township kid,Me!
springbok hooker,What is it?
township kid,Only hit the other players when the ref isn't looking!
pienaar,No. The first rule of rugby is you can only pass the ball backwards or sideways.
various springboks,"- If you drop the ball, or pass it forwards, you scrum for possession. - This is a scrum. - You kick forwards. "
kids,No!
springbok hooker,"Agh, bugger it, let's just run and pass. Whoever drops the ball does pushups!"
springbok lock,Okay. Who wants to scrum against me?
mandela,"Mr. Minister, please forgive me. This sounds excellent, and we will return to it, but if you'll indulge me for just one minute --"
mandela,"You see, that picture is worth any number of speeches."
boland botha,-- where the Springbok flight has just landed.
boland botha," I say cautiously, because in my humble opinion --"
boland botha,"-- this team has been over-trained on the field, and over-committed off it."
mandela,Around the world -- objectively -- what are they saying about our chances against Australia?
mandela,So it is very important that we beat Australia.  Thank you.
barbara,The Cabinet Ministers are here to brief you on the trip to Taiwan.
mandela,I'll be right out.
coach,"One week, boys."
jason,We need snipers on top of the stadium and these surrounding buildings.
local cop,Not a problem.
jason,We want these two approaches completely sanitized.
local cop,"Two approaches? JASON We're not going to decide which way we bring him in until the very last moment.  We need uniforms, plain clothes, sharp-shooters ..."
linga,And sniffer dogs.
jason,"Yes. No truck bombs, no Oklahoma City."
jason,"We've got an army unit on standby at Silvermine, if you need more men."
jason,"We're not taking any chances, okay. The President's going to be very exposed.  Much too exposed."
mandela,"Barbara, I have been studying."
barbara,For the summit in Taiwan? Good.
mandela,No. Not exactly.
mandela,Test me.
barbara,They look like thugs.
mandela,Block out the names. See if I can recognize them.
mandela,Andre Joubert. 
barbara,"Yes, Madiba."
mandela," Unfortunately, Chester is far too easy to identify. But that will change. It must."
pienaar,Players-only meeting in the team room after dinner.
springbok hooker,What's this? Homework?
pienaar,Sort of.
springbok wing,Cappie? What's this?
pienaar,We need to learn it. We can't just mouth the words anymore.
springbok hooker,"Nobody cares, as long as we win matches."
pienaar,They do care.
springbok lock,"It's their song, not ours."
springbok wing,It's a terrorist song.
springbok prop,They used to arrest you for singing it.
pienaar,And now it's one of our anthems.
springbok hooker,"Cap. You know I leave my guts on the field for you, and you know I'd follow you into a fight anywhere, any time. But this ..."
springbok hooker,... I can't even read it. I definitely can't pronounce the words.
pienaar,"Okay, boys. It's optional. Take it if you want to."
pienaar,"It means ""God Bless Africa"".  Which you have to admit, we could use."
boland botha,"Tell us, Mr. President, have you always been a rugby fan?"
mandela,"People do not realize that I once played rugby myself, when I was a student at Fort Hare. It is a very rough game. Almost as rough as politics."
mandela,"After all, if I cannot change when circumstances demand it, how can I ask others to?"
jason, We're going to land you on top of that building. We'll own the road between it and the stadium.
mandela,"Francois, gentlemen -- forgive me for interrupting your work the day before such an important match ...  ... I just wanted to wish you good luck, in person."
mandela,"And sometimes, very seldom, as President, I am allowed to do what I want."
pienaar," Mr. President, this is --"
mandela,"I know who this is.  Good luck Brendan, we're behind you all. Japie -- etc"
linga,Did you ever imagine this?
jason,How could I?
mandela,But where is Chester?
pienaar,"He's injured, sir. His hamstring. We're trying to keep it quiet."
mandela,Is he out for the whole tournament?
pienaar,"With hamstrings, who knows?  We'll miss him."
mandela,The whole country will miss him.
springbok prop,"Mr. President, sir --"
mandela,"Yes, Hennie."
springbok prop,-- this is for you. From us.
mandela,I am honored. Truly honored.
mandela,"Good luck gentlemen. Your country supports you, completely."
mandela,"Francois, walk with me."
mandela,I have something for you.
mandela,"This helped me, many times. Perhaps it will help you, too."
coach,Enough fun and games! We've still got work to do.
mary,It's time for bed.
mandela,I think I'll stay up a little longer. The country is excited tonight.
mary,You need to sleep. The doctor said.
mandela,The doctor has no sense of occasion.
coach,There's nothing more we can do. The game plan's good. It's just a matter of the boys executing it tomorrow.
manager,"That's Pienaar's job. It's in his hands, now."
nerine,You know the best thing about you being the captain?
pienaar,Uh ... the honor?
nerine,You don't have to share a room.
nerine," Francois, come on. It's been weeks."
pienaar,Uh uh. I need to be angry for tomorrow.
nerine,What's this?
pienaar,A poem. From the President.
nerine,How does a poem help you play rugby?
pienaar,The same way your visit does.  Inspiration.
linga,What happened?
hendrick,They scored.
linga,What happened?
hendrick,We scored.
hendrick,They scored again.
linga,We scored?
hendrick,Ja. We're tied.
hendrick,We're up by three.
linga,They're ahead?
hendrick,By four.
linga,What does that mean?
hendrick,We're only ahead by one.
hendrick,We're ahead by four.
hendrick,By seven.
hendrick,By fourteen.
linga,What happened?
hendrick,We won!
linga,We did?
trophy wife,You must be very pleased!
mandela,What man would not be pleased to be dancing with a beautiful woman like you?
trophy wife,"Oh, Mr. President, you're exaggerating."
mandela,"Indeed not. My father was a Xhosa chief, and therefore a polygamist. As you know, I am not.  But when I look at you ... I envy my father."
pienaar,"COACH'S RUN, NINE A.M. SHARP. PASS IT ON."
coach,I hope you're not that slow next week.
springbok flyhalf,What's going on?
pienaar,A change of pace.
springbok hooker,Who's bloody idea was this?
springbok lock,How do they bring the prisoners here?
deckhand,On this boat.
nerine, Imagine being able to see Cape Town so close by.
pienaar,That would make it worse.
pienaar,Can we see the President's cell?
prison guard,"Yes, of course.  We've done it up just the way it was."
prison guard, That means he was the 466th
barbara,What happened?
doctor,"It's simple exhaustion, but it'll lead to worse if it's not treated. He needs complete rest. And I don't mean just shifting the affairs of state to his bedroom. "
mary,You know him. He won't do that.
doctor,Then I'm going to put him into hospital. In isolation.
barbara,No. Not yet. I'll threaten him with hospital if he doesn't behave.
mary,I'll cancel everything.
doctor,And I'll come back tonight to make sure he's not working.
barbara, Don't cancel the trip to Taiwan. Not yet.
coach,That's not good enough.
coach,Let's hope the Samoans don't injure it again.
barbara,"Madiba, this is --"
mandela,I know who this is.
mandela,"Welcome, and thank you for coming such a long way to see me."
coach,Forty minute postponement. They're trying to clear the field.
mandela,Please excuse me for a moment.
mandela,This is very good ... very good! Who is our opponent?
mary,"The All Blacks play England tomorrow. Then, we'll know."
mandela,Please make sure that my schedule is clear for the entire match.
mary,"Yes, Madiba."
mandela,Let's do some work while we watch.
barbara,Just enjoy the rugby.
kwezi,"So, let me understand this. The All Blacks are killing a team that thrashed us last year?"
etienne,Thanks for reminding me.
springbok hooker,"We're going to have to tackle better than the English, that's for sure."
pienaar,We do.
mandela,Are those the judicial appointments for the Free State?
barbara,They'll keep until after the match.
etienne,Give it a spin when you pass it.  Like this.
springbok wing,How much does Lomu weigh?
springbok flank,About 120 kilos.
springbok lock,"Shit, that's what I weigh."
springbok wing,"Ja, but at least you're slow."
mandela,Come and look at this.
hendrick, You should've played rugby.
linga, They wouldn't let me carry my gun.
mandela,Do you still think I'm wasting my time with the rugby?
mandela,"Barbara, can you please tell the Minister of Sport that I need a detailed briefing on the All Blacks."
barbara,"This rugby, it's still strictly political?"
mandela,Oh yes. Of course.
pienaar,Don't lose them. I won't be able to get more.
mandela,"145 points, in one match?"
mandela,45 to 29. And it was not that close.  They seem unstoppable.
mandela,Their Maori war dance. Yes. It's very powerful.
mandela,How are we going to beat them?
mandela,"No ... no. I don't want to break their focus for even a minute.  But, how do we win? ON LINGA: an idea occurs to him. A wild idea. He almost turns and blurts it out -- restrains himself."
mandela,It's not enough. Not now. Not so close.  This country is hungry for greatness.
coach,How's the feeling in the dressing room?
pienaar,Calm.
manager,And Lomu? Are they talking about him?
coach,Nobody gives us a bloody chance. I like that. It plays into their one weakness.
coach,Their vanity.  I just want to show the bloody world how hard we tackle.
pienaar,I wish tomorrow was already here.
etienne," Come on, man. There's nothing more you can do today."
jason,Have I ever mentioned to you that I hate rugby?
etienne,"Once or twice, yes."
jason,"I just want to get him through tomorrow, safely. That's all."
etienne,We all do.
nerine,I brought one of your mom's protein shakes.
nerine,Thinking about tomorrow?
pienaar,"No, tomorrow's taken care of, one way or another."
pienaar,"I'm thinking about how you spend 30 years in a tiny cell, but come out ready to forgive the people who put you there."
linga,Big day.
hendrick,Be an even bigger day if we actually won.
hendrick,Where is he?
mandela,"Can a man not sleep in, when he has a big day ahead of him?"
linga," Okay, thanks. Out."
linga,He's sleeping in.
hendrick,Or was.
linga,I had an idea. About today.  It's a crazy idea.
hendrick,"Hey, don't worry, man. I already know you're crazy."
mandela,"Morning, boys."
mandela,What is it?
hendrick,"Linga had an idea, sir."
hendrick,Now you've done it.
jason,"The tickets sold out long before the team became so popular. So it's not exactly going to be the rainbow nation out there. That's the reality.  All it takes is one idiot trying to make a statement, or one crazy fool who thinks he hears god speaking to him over the radio."
jason,It's happened before!  But not today. Not on our watch. Not today.
face painter, Face flag?
boer,Bugger off!
boland botha,-- because their beloved green and gold have somehow managed to exceed all expectations.
boland botha,"So, take a reality check, sit back and share an afternoon with one billion fellow fans around the world. And as you do, feel a special pride in having made it this far. This is Boland Botha, signing off and sitting back at Ellis Park."
eunice,What's Mr. Francois doing now?
captain,Let it be noted that I'm taking control of the aircraft.
captain,I assume full responsibility for what happens from now on.
jason," Do you see that jet, to the east?"
etienne, Did they get clearance for this?
jason, Not from us.
jason, Where is he?
linga, VIP BOX.
jason, Get him out of there. Now.
linga, No time.
captain,Full throttle.
springbok wing,What the hell was that?
pienaar,"Breathe, boys. Breathe."
springbok hooker, The All Blacks won't like that.
crowd,Nelson ... Nelson ... Nelson ... NELSON ... NELSON ... NELSON ...
crowd,... NELSON ... NELSON ... NELSON ... etc.
mandela,I'm so glad you're here.
mandela,"Hello, Jonah."
pienaar,NKOSI --
all springboks,-- SIKELEL' IAFRIKA etc ...
mandela, Perhaps we should make a small wager?
mandela,I was thinking more along the lines of a case of wine.
linga,What happens now?
hendrick,Extra time. Twenty minutes.
linga,I don't think I can take it.
pienaar,Who's the fittest team on this field?
pienaar,Keep it here. Run it forward.
mandela,How long before the end?
boland botha,Francois ... a few words ...
boland botha,"... great game, but I don't think you could've done it without the amazing support of these 63,000 South Africans --"
pienaar," We didn't have the support of 63,000 South Africans today. We had the support of 42 million South Africans."
springbok manager,They're waiting for you over there.
mandela,"Francois, I want to thank you most sincerely for what you have done to our country."
pienaar,"Mr. President, I want to thank you for what you have done."
jason, This route's too crowded. We're changing to route B.
jason, Change to route C.
mandela,Tell Jason it's all right. There's no hurry.
linga, Madiba says no need to hurry.
