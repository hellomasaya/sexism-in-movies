jack, Ma'am?
jack,"Oh, ah, excuse me, can you tell me where I am?"
jack,Hello! Hello!
north,Yes!
north,"Ah, finally!"
yeti,Arghbal...
north,Ach!
north,How many times have I told you to knock?
yeti,Warga blarghgha!
north,What...? The Globe?
north,Shoo with your pointy heads. Why are you always under boot?
north,What is this?
north, Have you checked the axis? Is rotation balanced?
yeti, Wardle bawddrel.
north,Can it be?  Dingle!
north,Make preparations! We are going to have company.
bunnymund,"Ah, it's freezing."
north,"Sandy, thank you for coming."
north," I know, I know, but I obviously wouldn't have called you all here unless it was serious."
tooth, Pitch? Pitch Black? Here?!
north,Yes! There was black sand covering the globe.
bunnymund," What, what...what do you mean black sand?"
north,And then a shadow!
bunnymund,"Hold on, hold on, I thought you said you saw Pitch."
north,"Well, ah, not exactly..."
bunnymund,Not exactly? Can you believe this guy?
bunnymund,"Yeah, you said it, Sandy."
north,"Look, he is up to something very bad. I feel it, in my belly."
bunnymund," Hang on, hang on, you mean to say, you summoned me here THREE DAYS BEFORE EASTER - because of your belly? Mate, if I did this to you three days before Christmas--"
tooth, Argentina. Priority alert! A batch of bicuspids in Buenos Aires.
north,Please. Bunny. Easter is not Christmas.
bunnymund,Here we go...
bunnymund,"Look, mate, I'm dealing with perishables. Right. You've got all year to prepare."
tooth," Pittsburg, boy eight, two molars. Saltwater taffy."
north, Why are rabbits always so nervous.
bunnymund,And why are you always such a blowhard!
north, Tooth! Can't you see we're trying to argue.
tooth,"Sorry, not all of us get to work one night a year. Am I right, Sandy?"
tooth," San Diego, sector two! Five incisors, a bicuspid and a really loose molar on stand-by."
bunnymund," Come on, mate, Pitch went out with the dark ages. We made sure of that - remember?"
north,"Aah! Man in Moon! Sandy, why didn't you say something?"
north, It's been a long time old friend! What is big news?
bunnymund,It is Pitch.
north, Manny...what must we do?
tooth,"Ah, guys, you know what this means?"
north, He's choosing a new Guardian.
bunnymund,What?! Why?
north,Must be big deal! Manny thinks we need help!
bunnymund, Since when do we need help?!
tooth,I wonder who it's gonna be?
bunnymund,"Please not the groundhog, please not the groundhog."
north,Jack Frost.
bunnymund,"Ah, I take it back! The Groundhog's fine!"
tooth," Well, ah, as long he helps to ah...to protect the children, right?"
bunnymund,"Jack Frost!? He doesn't care about children! All he does is freeze water pipes and mess with my egg hunts. Right? He's an irresponsible, selfish..."
north,Guardian.
bunnymund,"Jack Frost is many things, but he is not a Guardian."
russian boy, Aahhhhh...!

claude," Come on, you guys believe anything."
sophie, Ow!
jamie,Mom! Sophie fell again!
jamie's mom,"You okay, Soph?"
claude,Are we sledding or what?
jamie's mom,"Jamie, hat? We don't want Jack Frost nipping at your nose."
jamie,Who's Jack Frost?
jamie's mom,"No one, honey. It's just an expression."
jack, Hey.
jack, Who's Jack Frost?
jamie," Okay, who threw that?"
jack,"Well, wasn't bigfoot kiddo."

jamie,Whoaaa! Did you guys see that? It was amazing! I slid - I did a jump and I slid under a car-ERF!!
jack,Whoops.
kids, Ooooh!
jamie,Cool! A Tooth!
kids," Dude, that means cash! Tooth Fairy cash! I love the Tooth Fairy!"
jack," Oh, no..."
kids, That's totally awesome. You lucky bug! Lucky!
jack,No!
jamie,I gotta put this under my pillow!
kids, I wish I lost my tooth.
jack,"Ah, wait a minute! Come on, hold on, hold on! What about all that fun we just had? That wasn't the Tooth Fairy, that was me!"
kids, I lost two teeth in one day once - remember that?! What are you gonna spend your money on? What are you gonna buy? How much do you think she's going to leave?
kids," Let's go...I'm cooold! My ears are freezing. I can't feel my toes. Ah, it's hot cocoa time."
jack,What's a guy gotta do to get a little attention around here!
cupcake," ""Oh, I'm cold, I'm cold, I'm co- old."""
jamie,"-- and then BAM! The sofa hit me, and, and see?  Ah hoo hay ow!"
jamie's mom,"Alright you, tooth under your pillow?"
jamie,Yeah. I'm ready.
jamie's mom,"Now don't stay up trying to see her, Jamie, or she won't come."
jamie,"But I can do it this time! You wanna help me, Soph? We can hide and see the Tooth Fairy!"
sophie," Hide, hide, hide, hide!"
jamie's mom,"Uh uh, straight to bed now, mister."
jamie,Mom...
jack,"If there's something I'm doing wrong, can you, can you just tell me what it is?  You put me here, the least you can do is tell me, tell me why."
jack,"Right on time, Sandman."
pitch,"Ohhhh, I thought I heard the clippity-clop of a unicorn. What an adorable dream!"
pitch," And look. At. Her. Precious child. So sweet, so full of hope and wonder. Why, there's only one thing missing...a touch of fear."
pitch,Hahaha! That never gets old!
pitch,"Feel your fear. Come on. Come on, that's right."
pitch,Yesss. What a pretty little Nightmare.
pitch,"Now, I want you to go tell the others the wait is over."
pitch,"Don't look at me like that, old friend. You must have known this day would come. My Nightmares are finally ready. Are your Guardians?"
jack,Whoa!
bunnymund,"Been a long time. Blizzard of 68, I believe? Easter Sunday, wasn't it?"
jack,Bunny? You're not still mad about that...are yah?
bunnymund,Yes.
jack,Hey!
yeti,Durbha wahla.
jack,Put me down! What the...
yeti,Durtal bardla burdlew.
yeti,Dwbard urghwetee.
bunnymund,Me?  Not on your nelly. See you back at the pole.
yetis,Bwardla arghl.
jack,Ahhhhhhhhh!
tooth," Walla Walla, Washington. We've got a trampoline mishap at 1340 Ginger Lane."
north,Quiet.
north,"Hey, there he is! Jack Frost!"
jack,"Wow, you gotta be kidding me."
jack,"Hey, hey. Whoa, put me down."
north,I hope the yetis treated you well?
jack,"Oh, yeah. I love being shoved in a sack and tossed through a magic portal."
north,"Oh, good! That was my idea! You know Bunny, obviously."
jack,Obviously.
north,And the Tooth Fairy?
tooth,"Hello, Jack. I've heard a lot about you. And your teeth."
jack,"My, my what?"
tooth," Oh, they really do sparkle like freshly fallen snow."
tooth,"Girls, pull yourselves together... Let's not disgrace the uniform."
north,And Sandman.  Sandy! Sandy! Wake up!
jack,Hey! Ho! Anyone wanna tell me why I'm here?
jack,"That's not really helping. But thanks, little man.  I musta done something really bad to get you four together."
jack,Am I on the naughty list?
north, On naughty list? You hold record! But no matter. We overlook. Now we are wiping clean the slate.
jack,How come?
bunnymund," Ah, good question."
north,How come? I tell you how come! Because now...you are Guardian!
jack,"What are you doing! Get, get that offa me!"
north,This is the best part!
jack,Huh?
jack,What makes you think I want to be a Guardian?
north,Of course you do!  Music!
jack,No music!
jack,"Look, this is all very flattering, but ah...you don't want me. You're all hard work and deadlines, and I'm snowballs and fun times. I'm not a Guardian."
bunnymund,"Yeah, that's exactly what I said!"
tooth,Jack...I don't think you understand what it is we do.
tooth,Each of those lights is a child.
north,"A child who believes. And good or bad, naughty or nice, we protect them.  Tooth...fingers out of mouth."
tooth," Oh, sorry. They're beautiful."
north,"Okay, no more wishy-washy! Pitch is out there doing who knows what!"
jack, You mean the Boogeyman?
north,"Yes! When Pitch threatens us, he threatens them as well."
jack,All the more reason to pick someone more qualified!
north,"Pick? You think we pick? No, you were chosen like we were all chosen. By Man in Moon."
jack, What?
tooth,"Last night, Jack. He chose you."
bunnymund,Maybe.
jack,"The Man in the Moon, he talks to you?"
north,"You see, you can not say no. It is destiny."
jack,"But why, why wouldn't he tell me that himself?  After 300 years this is his answer? To spend eternity like you guys cooped up in some, some hideout thinking of, of new ways to bribe kids? No no, that's not for me. No offense."
bunnymund,How is that not offensive?
bunnymund,"You know what I think? I think we just dodged a bullet. I mean, what's this clown know about bringing joy to children anyway?"
jack,"Uhh, you ever hear of a snow day? I know it's no hard-boiled egg, but kids like what I do."
bunnymund,"But none of 'em believe in you.  Do they? You see, you're invisible, mate. It's like you don't even exist."
tooth,Bunny! Enough!
jack,"No, the kangaroo's right."
bunnymund," The, the what -- what'd you call me? I am not a kangaroo, mate."
jack,"Oh. And this whole time I thought you were. If you're not a kangaroo, what are you?"
bunnymund,I'm a bunny. The Easter Bunny. People believe in me.
north, Jack. Walk with me.
jack,"It's nothing personal, North. What you all do, it's just, it's not my thing."
north,Man in Moon says it is your thing. We will see!
jack,"Slow down, wouldja? I've been trying to bust in here for years, I want a good look."
north," What do you mean, ""bust in?"""
jack,"Oh, don't worry, I never got past the yetis."
yeti,Rwwarrrrrr.
jack,"Oh, hey Phil."
north,"Keep up, Jack! Keep up!"
jack,Whoa!  I always thought the elves made the toys.
north, We just let them believe that.
north,Very nice! Keep up good work!
north, I don't like it. Paint it red.
north,"Step it up, everybody."
north,Fruit cake?
jack,"Ah, no, thanks."
north,Now we get down to tacks of brass!
jack, Tacks of brass?
north,"Who are you, Jack Frost? What is your center?"
jack,My center?
north,"If Man in Moon chose you to be a Guardian, you must have something very special inside."
north,Hmmmm?
jack,You are downright jolly.
north,"Ah, but not just jolly..."
jack,There's a tiny wooden baby?
north,Look closer. What do you see?
jack,You have big eyes?
north,Yes! Big eyes. Very big. Because they are full! Of wonder! That is my center. It is what I was born with. Eyes that have always seen the wonder in everything!
north,"Eyes that see lights in the trees, and magic in the air!"
north,"This wonder is what I put into the world, and what I protect in children.  It is what makes me a Guardian. It is my center. What is yours?"
jack, I don't know.
bunnymund,"We have a problem, mate! Trouble at the Tooth Palace."
jack,"North, North! I told you, I'm not going with you guys! There is no way I'm climbing into some rickety old..."
jack,...sleigh.
jack,Whoa!
north," Hey! Moi deti, moi deti. Quiet, quiet."
jack,"Okay, one ride, but that's it."
north,Everyone loves the sleigh.
bunnymund,"I think my tunnels might be faster, mate. And um, and safer."
north,"Ah, get in.  Buckle up!"
bunnymund,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, where are the bloody seatbelts?!"
north, That was just expression!
north,Are we ready?
north,Good! Let's go! Clear!  Hyah!
north,Out of the way!
north,Hyah!
bunnymund,Ohhhhhh no!
bunnymund," Slow down, slow down!"
north,I hope you like the loopty loops!
bunnymund, I hope you like carrots.
north,Here we go!
jack,WOOO-HOOOOOO!!!!!!
north,Klasno!
jack, Whoa!
jack,"Hey, Bunny--"
jack,Check out this view-- EEEYAAAAGGHGHH!
jack,Awww...you do care.
bunnymund,"Ah, rack off you bloody show pony!"
north,"Hold on everyone, I know a shortcut."
bunnymund,"Oh strewth, I knew we should have taken the tunnels."
north,"I say, Tooth Palace."
north,Hyah!
north,What!?
north,What are they!?
bunnymund,Whoa!
jack,They're taking the tooth fairies!
jack,"Hey little Baby Tooth, you okay?"
north,"Here, take over!"
bunnymund,Huh?
jack,Hyah!
north,Yah!
bunnymund,They're stealing the teeth!
north,"Jack, look out!"
jack,Aaaahhhh!
north,Tooth! Are you alright?
tooth,"They, they took my fairies! And the teeth! All of them! Everything is gone! Everything."
tooth,Oh thank goodness! One of you is alright!
pitch,"The Big Four, all in one place. I'm a little star-struck.  Did you like my show on the globe, North? Got you all together, didn't I?"
tooth,"Pitch, you have got thirty seconds to return my fairies!"
pitch,You'll stick a quarter under my pillow?
north,Why are you doing this?
pitch,Maybe I want what you have. To be believed in.
pitch,Maybe I'm tired of hiding under beds.
bunnymund,Maybe that's where you belong.
pitch,"Ah, go suck an egg, rabbit!"
jack,We're not.
pitch,Oh good.
pitch,"A neutral party. Then I'm going to ignore you. But, you must be used to that by now."
bunnymund,Pitch! You shadow sneaking rat- bag! Come here!
tooth,Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
pitch," Whoa! Hey, easy, girl. Easy."
pitch,"Look familiar, Sandman? Took me a while to perfect this little trick. Turning dreams into Nightmares."
pitch,"Don't be nervous, it only riles them up more. They smell fear you know."
bunnymund,What fear? Of you!? No one's been afraid of you since the Dark Ages!
pitch," Oh, the Dark Ages."
pitch,"Oh look, it's happening already."
jack,What is?
jack,What's going on?
tooth,"They, they don't believe in me anymore."
pitch,"Didn't they tell you, Jack? It's great being a Guardian -- but there's a catch. If enough kids stop believing, everything your friends protect - wonder, hopes and dreams - it all goes away. And little by little, so do they."
pitch,"No Christmas, or Easter, or little fairies that come in the night. There will be nothing. But fear and darkness and me! It's your turn not to be believed in!"
north,He's gone.
jack,"I'm sorry, about the fairies."
tooth, You should've seen them. They put up such a fight.
jack,Why would Pitch take the teeth?
tooth,It's not the teeth he wanted. It's the memories inside them.
jack, What do you mean?
tooth,"That's why we collect the teeth, Jack. They hold the most important memories of childhood."
jack,My memories?
tooth,From when you were young. Before you became Jack Frost.
jack," But, I wasn't anyone before I was Jack Frost."
tooth,Of course you were. We were all someone before we were chosen.
jack,What?
north, You should've seen Bunny.
bunnymund,"Hey, I told you never to mention that!"
jack,"That night at the pond...I just, why I assumed...Are you saying, are you saying I had a life before that? With a home? And a family?"
tooth,You really don't remember?
jack,"All these years, and the answers were right here. If I find my memories, then I'll know why I'm here.  You have to show me."
tooth,"I...I can't, Jack. Pitch has them."
jack,Then we have to get them back!
tooth,Oh no!
north,"No! No! No such thing as too late!  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Idea!! HAHH!!"
tooth,What?
north,We get teeth! Children keep believing in you!
tooth,We're talking seven continents! Millions of kids!
north,Give me break! You know how many toys I deliver in one night?
bunnymund,And eggs I hide in one day?
north,"And Jack, if you help us, we will get you your memories."
jack,I'm in.
north, Quickly! Quickly!
bunnymund,"Here we go, here we go..."
jack,"Hop to it rabbit, I'm five teeth ahead!"
bunnymund,"Yeah right, look, I'd tell you to stay outta my way, but really what's the point -- because you won't be able to keep up anyway."
jack,"Is that a challenge, cottontail?"
bunnymund,"Oh, you don't wanna race a rabbit, mate."
north,A race? Is it a race??
tooth,Four bicuspids over there! An incisor two blocks east! Is that a molar? They're EVERYWHERE!
tooth,Ow!
jack,"Ah, you okay?"
tooth,"Fine...sorry, it's been a really long time since I've been out in the field."
jack,How long is a long time?
tooth,"Ah, four hundred forty years...give or take."
jack,Hmm...
north,TWINS  Yipa!!
bunnymund,Jackpot!
bunnymund,"Looks like you're a bit of a brumby, hey mate."
north, Is piece of pie!
bunnymund,Ow!
north, That's my tooth! Sandy! Sandy!
tooth,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy there, champ! He's one of us! Part of the European division.  Ca va?"
bunnymund,Huh?
bunnymund,Crikey!
jack, Yes!
jack,No!
bunnymund,"Haha! Ho, ho, ho!"
tooth,Wow! You guys collect teeth and leave gifts as fast as my fairies.
pitch,The lights...why aren't they going out?
pitch,They're collecting the teeth?
pitch,"Oh pipe down, or I'll stuff a pillow with you!"
pitch,"Fine, have your last hurrah. For tomorrow, all you pathetic scrambling will be for nothing."
jack," Kids, huh?"
tooth,This was always the part I liked most - seeing the kids.  Why did I ever stop doing this?
jack,"It's a little different up close, huh?"
tooth,"Thanks for being here, Jack. I wish I had known about your memory, I could've helped you."
jack,"Yeah, well, look let's just get you taken care of. Then it's Pitch's turn, huh?"
north,Here you are!
tooth,SSHHHHHHHH!!
north,"Oh, what gives slowpokes!?"
north,"How you feeling, Toothy?"
tooth,Believed in.
north, Haha! That's what I want to hear.
north,SSSHHHHHHHHH!!!
jack,"You think I need help to beat a bunny? Check it out, Peter Cottontail."
bunnymund,You call that a bag of choppers?  Now that's a bag of choppers.
north,Gentlemen! Gentlemen! This is about Tooth. It's not a competition! But if it was --  I win. YEEEEEHAAAHH!
tooth,Surprise!  We came!
jack,He can see us?
bunnymund,Most of us.
tooth,"Shhh! You guys, he's still awake."
bunnymund,Sandy! Knock him out!
jamie,Huh?
bunnymund,"With the Dreamsand, ya gumbies."
jamie,"No, stop that's the Easter Bunny. What are you doing, Abbey? Down!"
bunnymund,"Alright, nobody panic."
jack," But that's a um, that's a greyhound. Do you know what greyhounds do to rabbits?"
bunnymund,I think it's a pretty safe bet he's never met a rabbit like me -
bunnymund,Crikey.
jamie,Stop! Sit!
jamie,"Down girl, down!"
north,"Sandy, Sandy!"
north,Ah!
tooth,"Hey, this is not proper Tooth Fairy behavior!"
bunnymund,Oh no.
north,Candy canes...
jamie,Whoaaaaaaaaaa!
jack,Whoops...
jack,"Oh, I really wish I had a camera right now."
sophie,Pretty!
sophie,Bunny! Hop! Hop! Hop!
sophie,Ow!
north,Whuh-huh...?
jack,Wahooo!  Haha! Yes!
jack,Waaahahoooo!
jack, HAAAH! I got it!
jack,"Sandy! Sandy, did you see that?!? Look at this thing!"
pitch,Frost?
pitch,"You know, for a ""neutral party"" you spend an awful lot of time with those weirdos.  This isn't your fight, Jack."
jack,You made it my fight when you stole those teeth.
pitch,Teeth? Why do you care about the teeth?
pitch, Now this is who I'm looking for--
pitch,Whoa--??
jack,Remind me not to get on your bad side.
pitch," Okay, easy! You can't blame me for trying, Sandy. You don't know what it's like to be weak and hated. It was stupid of me to mess with your dreams. So I'll tell you what-"
jack,"You take the ones on the left, I'll take the ones on the right?"
pitch,Boo!
north,Ah!
bunnymund,Get outta my warren!  Huh?
north,Ha. Ha. Ha. Come on!
jack,Aaaaaaaah!
bunnymund, You might want to duck.
jack,We gotta help Sandy!
north,Hyah!
jack,Noooo!
north,Jack!
pitch,"Hahahahaha!...Don't fight the fear, little man."
north,"Hurry, hurry!"
pitch,"I'd say sweet dreams, but there aren't any left."
north,Sandy...
jack,No...NOOOOOO!!!!
jack,Ahhhhhh!!!!!
pitch,AAAHH!!!!
north,Jack!
tooth,"Jack, how did you do that?"
jack," I, I didn't know I could."
pitch,Finally! Someone who knows how to have a little FUN!
north,Are you alright?
jack,"I just, I wish I could've done something."
north,"Done something? Jack, you stood up to Pitch. You saved us."
jack,But Sandy wo--
north, Would be proud of what you did.
jack,"But how can I know who I am, until I find out who I was?"
north,"You will. I feel it, in my belly."
tooth,Look how fast they're going out.
jack, It's fear. He's tipped the balance.
bunnymund, Easter is tomorrow and I need your help. I say we pull out all the stops and we get those little lights flickering again!
north,"Bunny is right.  As much as it pains me to say old friend, this time Easter is more important than Christmas!"
bunnymund,Hey! Did everyone hear that?!
north,"We must hurry to the Warren. Everyone, to the sleigh!"
bunny,"Ohh no, mate. My warren my rules. Buckle up."
north,Shostakovich!
north," ""Buckle up."" Is very funny."
bunnymund,Welcome to the warren--
bunnymund,Something's up.
bunnymund,Ahhhh!
jack,Sophie?
sophie,"Elf, elf, elf!"
bunnymund,What is SHE doing HERE!!?
north," Ah, snow globe."
bunnymund,Crikey! Somebody do something!
jack,"Don't look at me, I'm invisible, remember?"
tooth, It's okay little one.
sophie, Pretty!
tooth,"Awww! You know what, I got something for you. Here it is.  Look at all the pretty teeth with little blood and gum on them."
jack, Blood and gums? When was the last time you guys actually hung out with kids?
sophie,Peek-a-boo.
north,We are very busy bringing joy to children! We don't have time...  ...for children.
jack,"If one little kid can ruin Easter, then...we're in worse shape than I thought."
sophie,"Weeee! Weee, weee, weee!"
bunnymund,You wanna paint some eggs? Yeah?
sophie,Okay!
bunnymund,Come on then!
north,Rimsky Korsakov! That's a lot of eggs.
jack,"Uh, how much time do we have?"
sophie,Weeeeee!
bunnymund,Woooohoooo!
north, Single file!
north,"Okay, that's little strange."
bunnymund,"Naw, mate --"
bunnymund,There will be springtime! On every continent! And I'm bringing hope with me!
bunnymund,"Too Christmas-y, mate, paint `em blue."
jack,Not bad.
bunnymund,Not bad yourself.
jack,"Look, I'm sorry about that whole, you know, the ""kangaroo"" thing."
bunnymund,"It's the accent, isn't it?"
bunnymund,"Ah, poor little ankle-biter. Look at her, all tuckered out."
tooth,I love her!
tooth,I think it's time to get her home.
jack,How about I take her home?
tooth,"Jack, no! Pitch is--"
jack,--no match for this. 
bunnymund,"Which is why we need you here, with us."
jack,"Trust me, I'll be quick as a bunny."
jack,We should get back.
jack,"That voice, I know that voice..."
jack,"Don't worry, there's still time."
jack, I have to find out what that is.
jack," I'm gonna get you out of here, just as soon as I --"
jack, As I can --
jack,Afraid?
pitch,Maybe not. But you are afraid of something.
jack,"You think so, huh?"
pitch,I know so. It's the one thing I always know.
pitch,"Well fear not, for the answer to that..."
pitch,"Do you want them, Jack? Your memories?"
pitch,...in this little box.
pitch,"Why did you end up like this? Unseen. Unable to reach out to anyone.  You want the answers so badly. You want to grab them, and fly off with them. But you're afraid of what the Guardians will think."
pitch,You're afraid of disappointing them.  Well let me ease your mind about one thing. They'll never accept you. Not really.
jack, Stop it! Stop it!
pitch,"After all, you're not one of them."
jack,You don't know what I am!
pitch,"Of course I do. You're Jack Frost. You make a mess wherever you go. Why, you're doing it right now."
jack,What did you do?
pitch,"More to the point Jack, what did you do?"
jack,Baby Tooth!
jack,No.
british kids," There are no eggs. There's none anywhere. I give up. Come on, let's go. I don't understand."
british girl,Maybe he just hid them really well this year.
british boy,I checked everywhere! There's nothing!
bunnymund," Yes there is! There is! I mean these aren't my best lookin' googies, but they'll do in a pinch!"
british girl,I can't believe it.
