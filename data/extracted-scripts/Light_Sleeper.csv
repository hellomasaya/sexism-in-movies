Speaker,Dialogue
written by, Paul Schrader
shooting draft, 1992
letour," Labor Day weekend. Some time for a sanitation strike. Everybody crazy to stock up. They decide to score at the last minute and want it now. Never fails. The faces look alike. You gotta use memory tricks: each has some peculiarity -- it keeps you sharp. A D.D. told me when a drug dealer starts writing a diary it's time to quit. I started writing after that. Not every night -- now and then. Just to burn off the night. Fill up one book, throw it out, start another."
ann,Darling.
letour,Ann.
ann,Have we made New York safe for another weekend?
letour, Robert.
robert,Get a job.
letour, Sad what ten years without sex can do.
ann,Any hundreds?
letour,Twenties -- and tens.
robert,Tens!
ann,Goddamn cash machines.
robert,Did what's-his-name give you a hard time?
letour, You mean --?
robert,Yeah.
letour,Cash Before Delivery.  CBD.
robert,Fucking investment bankers.
ann,"These Wall Street kids deal with fake money all day, they think cash is a theoretical concept -- like it doesn't apply. I see 'em at two, shudder to think at nine they're buying and selling -- turned me off the stock market."
letour,It's late.  You staying?
robert,It's over.
letour,"I'm gonna crash -- try, at least."
ann," Tomorrow will be easier. Maybe we can all eat together. Go on. You look tired. Here, take a couple of C's. I'll pick up anything that comes in."
ann,Sleep tight.
robert,Pick up the trash.
letour, Yeah -- big kiss.
letour," ""Labor Day."" ""Union Movement"" -- there's a contradiction in terms. I know about long hours. It's worse when I'm off -- I just walk and walk. Where am I going? There's an element of providence to it all. Like rolling numbers. Luck. You're walking down the street, some guy that looks maybe a little like you does a stick-up four hours ago, there's an APB description out and a cop pulls you in cause he's cold and wants to go inside -- they grab your stash. Your number's up. You're busted for nothing. For bad luck."
jealous,"Are they ""faced""?"
letour,Don't bore me.
jealous,"Is it so much work to face them the same direction? You don't do it, I got to. It's time -- my time --"
letour, Jees --
jealous,We've been through all this.  This nineteen-gram shit is a drag.
letour,"We pay you more, you put up with more. White drugs for white people. Twice the price, twice the safety."
jealous,I can't believe Ann's been working as long as she has -- never busted. She's something.
letour,Never made any big money either.
jealous,Sure.
letour,She blows it.
jealous,You believe that? What you gonna do after she quits? How long you been with her?
letour,"She always says that. We'll see, Jealous."
jealous,"She's out. You should pick up her trade. You're too old to be a go- fer. They know you, they trust you."
letour,"No way. I'm not the management type. I get in charge, I'll start using again -- not for me. I know music people. I'm gonna get in recording."
jealous,Yeah.
jealous,Tour.
letour,What?
jealous,"Normally this wouldn't matter to you, but you may get hassled."
letour,Why?
jealous,You read the papers? The Park murder. All over the Post. Mariah Rangel -- nineteen-year-old Barnard co-ed bitch dead in Turtle Pond coked to the fucking gills. All of a sudden they're hot after mid-level dealers. They're buzzin'. You know her?
letour, Thanks for the warning.
robert,Jack.
robert,You pick up from Jealous?
letour," Yeah, nineteen grams after four times last night. We're certainly not his favorite people."
robert,"We don't make the laws. Nineteen is carrying, twenty is dealing. Let him be stupid."
letour,He took my hundreds.
robert, Take over for a while. I'm getting contact high.
letour, Who's Her Majesty talking to?
robert,"The Ecstasy connection. From Arizona. She's trying to get them to come here -- or, better, Europe."
letour,That's where the money is.
robert,"All mark-up -- the ""Big One."""
letour, You really think she means it?
robert,"That's what she says. New Year's Eve and out -- no Acid House, no product, no deliveries."
letour,That's just her mouth talking.
robert,Next year -- strictly Akasha.
letour,"""Akasha""?"
robert,Cosmetics. That's what Ann's calling the company now --
letour," -- this week. I don't get it -- marigolds, violets, sage -- why'd anyone pay to put weeds on their face?"
robert,Why'd anyone pay to put them up their nose? I like cosmetics. I need cosmetics. You should come in with us.
letour,You forget: she hasn't asked me.
ann, Johnny! Robert! Come here!
ann," Plant me two kisses, boys, fifteen hundred Ex at thirty each and the delivery's here."
ann, Whatja think?
letour,Of what?
ann,"The face cream. Almond, marigold, chamomile, egg, aloe -- the ""Almilk"" formula. I remixed it."
letour, Very nice.
ann,"Reminds me, if you get downtown stop at Enhancements and pick up some almond oil -- not the California.  What should we order?"
letour,How about Indian?
ann,"Darling, it's Saturday."
robert,Thai. We haven't had Thai in a while.
ann's voice,"""Hello. This is Ann. If you leave a message, we'll get back to you -- sooner than you think."""
ann, Answer that. He'll call back every five minutes.
robert, The night begins.
ann,"""Ped Srilom""? -- it's Northeastern. Duck."
letour," I'm going veggie. Get me the ""Puk Ob."""
robert, Me too.
letour,Use it for facial cream.
robert, Remove unsightly hair!
ann,"Laugh, one day you'll be watching me on ""Oprah"" from a welfare hotel."
letour,Forgive us.
robert, Eddie wants now. Now. His place. Top Lady. God knows what happened to his shit yesterday.
ann, You take it -- call in.
letour,It was supposed to be light tonight.
robert,Don't you watch TV?
letour,Don't have one.
robert,"Well if you were the normal stupid fuck you should be so lucky to be and had one, you'd know it's supposed to rain --"
ann,Good for the trees --
robert,Some farmer whacked his numerology on us.
ann, It's started.
robert,The Farmer's Almanac is based on numerology.
letour,Raining?
ann,"Take a coat.  And you, clean up the product before the food delivery comes."
eddie,Le Tour! -- finally. What took so long?
letour, Traffic. It's raining.
eddie,How's things?
letour,Okay.
eddie,I need a quarter -- you got it?
letour, Robert said he sold you a quarter yesterday.
eddie, Some friends came over. How much is that? Fourteen-hundred?
letour,"Eddie. Look at yourself. Sit down. I've known you, what, like eight years?"
eddie, Yeah...
letour,"Knew you from the other job, the one before the last one you fucked up. I knew your wife -- remember her? We used to sit and talk and talk --"
eddie, You don't know what she was like --
letour,"This is no good. I'll sell you a gram and some downs, but I ain't gonna put you in the emergency room. Cool it. Go to bed. Sleep it off."
eddie, You charge $200 for what goes for ninety on the street -- and you're not gonna sell?
letour, So go to the street.
eddie,I'll call Ann.
letour,Go ahead. You know what she'll say. Phone's over there.
eddie, I'll tell the fucking cops.
letour, Don't call again. Catch you next lifetime.
eddie," Please, Tour, I'm sorry. You're right. I didn't mean that. I'm quitting anyway. I'll take the gram. Sorry."
letour, Okay.
eddie,Two hundred?
letour,You got downs?  One more thing. I gotta use the phone.
letour, I've got to go.
letour," Everybody wants to talk. It's like a compulsion. My philosophy is: you got nothing to say, don't say it. They figure you can tell a D.D. anything, things they would never tell anyone else. He understands. Of course they're stoned to start. If I could tie together all the hours of coke talk I've heard, that would be a lot of string. It was Robert's idea to add twenty-five dollars to home deliveries cause it's such a hassle. Fifty is more like it."
first student,"C'mon, Tour, stick around."
second student,Yeah.
first student,"There's only four of us and like seven of them -- and we're paying for the dope. See her, over there, the blonde, long hair, yellow skirt? -- she's gonna model for Elite."
letour, Me? I'm an old man. She'd break me like an old horse.
second student,"Shit, dude --"
letour,Nah. Thanks anyway. 
letour, Carlos. Wait a second.
letour,Marianne! Marianne! Hop in! I'll give you a ride.
letour,John. John LeTour.
marianne, John?
letour,Get in. You're getting soaked.
marianne, Hi...
letour,Where are you going?
letour,I didn't know you still lived here.
marianne, Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. I should get out.
letour,Don't be crazy. It's pouring.
marianne,I'm not supposed to be around --
letour, -- former drug associates.
marianne,"It's four years I'm clean. No alcohol, no cigarettes, no nothing."
letour,I heard. I'm happy for you.
marianne,It's still not easy.
letour,"I know. Mar, you don't need to avoid me. I'm straight -- two years. It came that time. I tried to tell you. I wrote. I called."
marianne, I should get out.
letour,Honest.
marianne,But you're dealing.
letour,No. I stopped.
marianne,What's in the bag?
letour,Almond oil. You can check.  Look.
letour,Shit.
marianne,What's that for? In case someone needs almond oil in the middle of the night?
letour,"I still deal a little, but I'm straight -- that part's true. Believe me."
marianne, Stop here. Now. Stop!
letour,I won't say anything. I promise. I'll just sit here. I'll just give you a ride.
marianne,"Goodbye, John."
letour,Where do you live?  Mari...
driver,Sir?
letour,Eighty-third Street.
teresa, Coffee?
letour, Thanks.
teresa, Black?
letour, Yeah.
teresa, Here.
letour,I'm not sure how this works.
teresa,Have you ever been to a psychic before?
letour,"No, but I've, well, I've heard about it."
teresa,Do you need advice? John?
letour, No... it's not that... I don't know -- I just decided to come. I thought...
teresa,Be comfortable.  How did you hear about me?
letour,"A recommendation. Somebody from work. Two hundred dollars, right?"
teresa,It's a lot of money?
letour,I don't care.
teresa, More than usual. Your aura is very strong. I feel a very strong vibration from you. A change is coming. You're worried about money. You say you don't care about money but that's not true.
letour,Yeah.
teresa,Your livelihood is endangered. You're worried about the future. You don't have much money saved. What will you do?
letour,I don't know.
teresa,I see a woman who has betrayed you.
letour, My mother?
teresa, Who will betray you.
letour,Not... I...
teresa,"Keep it in mind. I have a strong feeling about this woman, a woman close to you, she will betray you. You're in the entertainment business, aren't you?"
letour,Yes.
teresa,But you're not happy. You want to do something else. Is it music?
letour,Yes...
teresa,You have a talent for music.
letour,As a child.
teresa,You still have it. It's strong. I see music in your future. A career opportunity will come in the music field. Take it. It won't seem promising. Take it anyway.  You're full of stress. Are you exercising?
letour,No. I --
teresa,"You should exercise more. You must let go of this stress. It's not good for your health. I'm not saying you're going over to the other side, but it's not good for you. You're still drinking, aren't you? You have a drinking problem?  It's interfering with your health and your life too. You've had other problems. Drug addiction."
letour,Yes.
teresa,This was very important in your life.
letour,Yes.
teresa,"You are in the balance. Everything you do -- positive or negative -- in this life is a drop that will carry over in the next. Every act, every decision matters."
letour,Teresa?
teresa,What is it?
letour,I'm thirty-eight years old.  Forty.
teresa,You're young.
letour,I have trouble sleeping.  Look. What do you see around me? Is there anything? Is it dark? Have I run out of luck? Is there luck?
teresa,I see a glow. Everything you need is around you. The only danger is inside you.
ann, Your pay's on the table.
young hasid," One hundred thirty-one, let's make it 130-$13,000, hundreds for small bills. One percent commission, $130 to you -- add tens or whatever if you want."
young hasid,Same time?
ann, Two weeks -- don't run. Stay a while. We'll order kosher. We'll tell you dirty stories. We'll talk Zionism.
young hasid, I'm late already. I only come 'cause I like you. Sure you're not Jewish? I don't want to see you hurt. Find a man. You should do something else.
ann, Invest in my cosmetics line.
young hasid, Don't mix business with friendship.
young hasid,Shalom.
ann,Shalom.  Don't eat any hot dogs!
letour,Jealous said something about a yuppie murder in the Park. You know anything about it?
ann,It's all over the news.
letour,Jealous said to be careful.
ann,We are careful.
robert, Tis is at St. Luke's. He wants somebody over right away. Second floor waiting room.
letour,A hospital? What's he doing there?
robert,He says he needs you to come to St. Luke's. I'd go but I got the other thing.
letour,The --?
robert,Yeah.
ann, Go. Keep on his good side. He set up Arizona.
ann, Let's have lunch. Tomorrow.
letour,Me?
ann,One o'clock. Cte Basque. Is that too early?
letour,No. Yeah -- sure.
robert,Tonight?
letour,I vote Japanese.
ann,Fine.
robert,Okay.
letour, Mixed sushi. Oshitashi.
letour,What's going on?
tis,You got some valiums?
letour, -- 'n 'ludes.
tis,Just a valium -- a ten.
letour,What is it?
tis,"You won't believe it. What a nightmare. I brought in this chick. She O.D.ed -- man, I didn't even know her. I didn't have to bring her in. The cops are coming back to talk to me. I'm hyper. I gotta come down."
letour, Here.
tis,Make it two.
tis,Thanks.
letour,She okay?
tis,Who?
letour,The girl.
tis,"Yeah, yeah. Met her last night. A walking vacuum cleaner. What a nightmare. Underage."
letour,You need a lawyer?
tis, He's here. Thanks.
letour,Any time.
randi,John!
letour,Randi?
randi, I can't believe it. Marianne's here too. She flew in. It's been so long. You look great.
letour," You too. Randi, what's wrong? Why are you here?"
randi,Mom. She's back in. Didn't Marianne tell you?
letour,Serious?
randi, More chemo.
letour,Can I see her?
randi,"She's sleeping. She sleeps most of the time. She'd like it, though. She still talks about you."
letour, I'm so sorry. She's a terrific woman. I was crazy about her. God.
randi,It's John. What a coincidence.
marianne, Hi.
letour, Randi told me about your mom. I'm sorry.
marianne,Thanks.
letour,She's sedated?
marianne,Yeah.
randi,She would be so happy to see John.
marianne,I don't think that would be a good idea.
letour,You both look so tired.
marianne,One of us has to be here.
randi,The hospital lets us stay in her room.
letour,Let me buy you some coffee or something -- the cafeteria's downstairs. It helps to talk.
randi,"You go, Marianne, it's my turn with mom."
marianne,I shouldn't.
randi,Go. You haven't eaten. Go on.  Go on.
marianne,I...
randi,Bring me a coffee.
letour,This way.  Kiss your mother for me.
letour,I like your mom.
marianne,"She liked you. You know this will happen someday, but when it does... Your mother -- that was a shock."
letour, She's been sick a while?
marianne,A year.
letour,Your father?
marianne, Not this time. His new wife -- he'll make it to the funeral.
letour,What have you been doing? Where do you live?
marianne,It's...  I don't want you to know about my life.
letour,Anything? You married? Have children? A dog?  House plants?
marianne,Details just open the door.
letour,The door to what?  It's not like we're strangers. We were married.
marianne,We were not.
letour,There was a ceremony.
marianne,He wasn't even a minister. He was an astrologer.
letour,"He was also a minister. ""Universal Harmony."""
marianne,He was a Pisces.
letour,You're a Pisces.
marianne,It was not legal.
letour,In the eyes of Jeanne Dixon we're still --
marianne,I was on the cusp.
letour,We were happy.
marianne,We were miserable. We were either scoring or coming down -- mostly coming down.
letour,"There were good times. Area, out on the street, laughing, dancing with friends -- we were magical."
marianne,"You took off for three months without telling me and called once. That's how magical we were. You were an encyclopedia of suicidal fantasies -- I heard them all. Nobody could clear a room like you, John. And the friends, you may have noticed, turned out to be mine, not yours. I envy you. A convenient memory is a gift from God."
letour,You exaggerate.
marianne,"In rehab they call this ""euphoric recall."" You only remember the highs, never the lows."
letour,We were happy.
marianne,I was drowning.
letour,It wasn't me --
marianne,You watched --
letour,You jumped --
marianne,"You did nothing -- ""It wasn't your business, you weren't responsible"" -- you still think like that.  Actions have consequences; so do --"
letour, I --
marianne,-- inactions.
letour,I didn't --  I meant well.
marianne,You always meant well.
letour,We were in love?
marianne,Yes.
letour,We were happy?
letour,You bought it for me. It's inscribed inside.
letour,Ann's quitting. I've got to find something else to do.
marianne,Ann? I'll believe it when I see it.
letour,It's true.
marianne,Are you really straight?
letour,Yeah.
marianne,Let me see your eyes.
marianne,Eyes are deceiving.  Congratulations.
letour,"If I could do that, I could do anything."
marianne,What do you mean?
letour,We could do anything. We could start over.
marianne, What was that? I think I heard something.
letour,I'm serious.
marianne,You're crazy.
letour, This is crazy.
marianne,I have to get back.
letour,I'll walk you.
letour," I can always find another way to make a living. I never planned this in the first place -- not like Ann. She came up to sell, have parties, make contacts. She was so glamorous. I just wanted to be around her. She'd sit up listening to coke stories. Now it's me and Robert. The whole crowd was the same age. Everybody's younger now. She made me."
ann,You have any money saved?
letour,There's some. Not much. A thousand or two. Maybe more -- I'm not sure.
ann,What do you do with your money?
letour,I don't know. It's not that much in the first place -- as you know.
ann, It's tax free --
letour,"Rent, utilities, phone, tips, CDs -- what about your money?"
ann,"Kitty Ford once told me, ""Ann, the only person I know that lives as well as you is my grandmother."" All the money I've made, all the money I've spent -- it never adds up. This last two years cosmetics' been taking everything."
letour,I wish I could help.
ann,You still go to meetings?
letour,"No, but I'm okay. What are the odds of meeting someone you haven't seen in years twice in two days?"
ann,Ask Robert to make up a chart for you; the other person -- who is it?
letour,Just a contact -- you don't know him.
ann,What's the plan?
letour,The plan?
ann,What you gonna do?
letour,My future?
ann,Too conceptual?
letour,We had this conversation two years ago. We'll have it two years from now.
ann,This time it's for real.
letour," I'm thinking of some music courses. Mixing, sound editing --"
ann,You took that before.
letour,That was acting.
ann, Modeling.
letour,Why all this concern? Suddenly you care?
ann,"I have feelings too -- you may have noticed. I guess I'm worried. I'm tough, you gotta to be tough, especially in this business, it's one thing to act tough -- I've seen Zipporah twice this week."
letour,She helps you?
ann," -- harmonizes, she's encouraging me to get out of this into the cosmetics thing --"
ann," His wife says he gets straight or she cuts him off. Old money. I remember the last thing he said to me: ""See you soon."" Yeah, sure. That was five years ago."
ann," You'll still talk to me, won't you?"
letour,You --?  Of course I will.
ann,It'll be strange without you around. I hadn't thought of it -- it hit me.
letour, We'll always have Paris.
ann, John.
letour,"Ann, you want me, call, write a letter, tell a wino -- I'll be there."
letour, I'm sorry. I...
letour," I always thought my father would die first. He would die, then my mother and I would reconcile. Just her and me. I hated him for living."
marianne,It's like a joke. It's not a real feeling. It's like a feeling of a feeling.
letour,"My old man bawling in the hospital, me popping in and out of the john getting loaded.  I miss you."
marianne,You tried to kill me. You took ten years of my life one way or another.  I couldn't hate my mom -- I was too busy hating you.
letour,I thought I was just killing myself.
letour,Selfish.
marianne,I remember.
letour,What?
marianne,What it felt like.  What this tasted like.
letour,I see you and my heart starts thumping.
marianne,John.
letour,Excuse us.  Let's go.
marianne,Come. Come with me.
letour,Have you ever had sex totally straight?
marianne,Not with you.
letour,Neither have I.
marianne,Such an erection.
letour,Never had anything like it stoned. Feel it. 
marianne,Weird.
letour, Wow.
marianne,I'm dripping.
letour,Let's disappear.
letour,"Kiss, kiss, kiss."
marianne,"Kiss, kiss, kiss."
letour,Together.
letour, You need to go back?
marianne,"This is the end. It was wonderful. I'm glad it happened this way. It will never happen again. You will not see me, you will not call me again. I'm happy for you. I wish you the best. I'm leaving. I'm going back to the hospital. I shouldn't have left -- but I don't regret it. Please dress and leave as soon as possible. I have a key. Goodbye."
letour,Marianne...
marianne,It's my fault.
letour,I love you.
ann,"Johnny, what is this? Your beeper broke, gettin' some shiatsu? Two hours: where have you bee?"
letour,There was a mix-up --
ann,"How you gonna survive on your own? The U.N.'s got some conference in two days. The holiday's over -- ragheads everywhere trying to score. U.N. security at every hotel -- little creeps with lapel pins. Even I've been out. This is where our money is: Europe, Asia, not the streets -- you wouldn't know crack from crackerjacks."
letour,Where's Robert?
ann,Busting his ass. He's out doing your job.
letour,It was a confusion.
ann,Get confused on your day off.
letour,When is that?
ann,Don't get wise. What do you want me to do? Suck your dick? -- okay. A raise? No way. Get out there. There's a list on the TV. I love you. Get your ass outta here before I kiss it.
letour, I'm on my way. Love you. Forgive me.
tis,"Tour, sit. Take a rest. LeTour, this is Gabri, Tasha -- you know Thomas. They're here for a show."
letour,Enchant.  How'd it turn out?
tis, What?
letour,St. Luke's.
tis,"No problem, but -- can you believe this? -- she's out of the hospital in one day, calls me up, wants to ""get together."" Some people are just born for losing. Want to go in back?"
letour,Not now.
tis,Huh?
letour,"Look at the bar. Black-haired guy, late twenties, brown suit, drinking tonic?  He's casing you. Not me, you. Undercover, whatever -- he's on you."
tis,You know him?
letour, Just a feeling. You holding?
tis,No. Need help?
letour, Leave a message. Robert or I will come by later.
tis,"Forget it. It wasn't for me anyway.  Make it tomorrow. A half -- no, three- quarters."
letour,Nineteen is the top. I'll make two trips.
tis,Nineteen is fine.
letour," A domani. Take care, girls."
letour," I feel my life turning. All it needed was a direction. You drift from day to day, years go by. Suddenly there is a direction. What a strange thing to happen halfway through your life."
hotel switchboard, Paramount Hotel.
letour,"Marianne Jost, please."
hotel switchboard, Just a moment.
hotel message,"""Welcome to the Paramount. Your party is out. If you would like to leave a message for -- "
hotel switchboard, Paramount Hotel.
letour,Marianne Jost.
hotel switchboard, Just a moment.
hotel switchboard, I'm sorry. Ms. Jost checked out this morning.
letour,She was there yesterday.
hotel switchboard, She checked out this morning.
letour,Did she leave a forwarding number?
hotel switchboard, No.
letour,Thank you.
letour,Mrs. Jost. JoAnn Jost. She's a patient.
medical voice, Who is this calling?
letour, Skyline Floral. We're trying to confirm a delivery.
medical voice, Mrs. Jost passed away last night.
letour,Are the funeral arrangements local?
medical voice," Just a sec -- yes, Plaza Memorial."
letour,Thank you.
medical voice, You're welcome.
letour,"Can I help you, officer?"
guidone,What?
letour,"I hope I haven't made a mistake. You are a cop, aren't you?"
guidone,Yes.
letour,Could I see a badge?
guidone, Bill Guidone.
letour,What is it?
guidone,"You think you're invisible, don't you? You think we don't know you, LeTour -- that's the name you use, right?"
letour,"My father's a partner in a powerful law firm. If you have anything in mind, do it by the book."
guidone, You? Who the fuck cares about you? I could grind you right here! -- maybe I will! -- and nobody would give a fuck! You're not worth the paperwork. I look like Narcotics? I'm Homicide -- I'm investigating the Park murder.
letour, I don't follow the news.
guidone,"Downtown's interested how a Barnard honors student with fancy parents got a quarter of uncut coke on her when she was murdered. I mean, we just don't see this girl cruising Alphabet City trying to score. Somebody sold her, somebody upscale and classy -- you're classy, I hear -- and that somebody knows something we need to know.  Delivery boy!"
letour,I wish I could help. I don't even know who's president.
guidone,"Let me put it this way. Here's my card  Ask around, take a week or so. Call me. Tell me something I don't know. Either that, leave town, or get your ass busted day in, day out."
marianne,Get out.
letour,Marianne...
marianne," Every time you come into my life something terrible happens. I thought I was rid of you. How'd you get here? I don't want you here! I don't want you around me, I don't want you around my mother! Damn you!"
letour,Marianne...
marianne, Get out!
letour,I didn't...
randi,"I'm sorry. That's the way it is. You shouldn't have come. Marianne has been up all night, crying and crying. She wasn't there when Mother passed -- died -- she blames herself. It wouldn't have made any difference. She just slipped away. Marianne's -- I'm worried --"
letour,It's...
randi,Don't try.
letour,How are you?
randi,Me?
letour,"Yes, you. I can't think of anything, but if there was anything I could do..."
randi,"Thanks. I'm okay -- I guess. I mean, we've been expecting it. It'll hit me later."
letour,I saw her.
randi,Who?
letour,Your mother. I came in the room. You were sleeping. I just watched.
randi,Oh.  I'd better get back. Marianne's probably flipping out.
ann,Have some shu mai. Just delivered.
letour,No.
robert, I told Ann you'd be on time. Tis called. He said before ten. He said you were right.
ann,About what?
letour,An undercover cop. Not a narc. The Park murder. Jealous was straight on that -- you hear anything?
robert,"Remember the time that cop called here? Wanted to know if we had ""nose candy""?  Ann says, ""John Candy?"" ""John Candy?"""
ann,What's wrong baby? You like like shit. Something wrong? 
letour,No.
ann,You can't fool me. I can read you.
letour, I mean it's not exactly like I got a pension plan.
robert, Jack.
ann," Johnny, it's not that at all. Is that what you think? You hate cosmetics. You don't care about it. You told me that."
letour,I know.
ann,Who knows what will happen?
robert,I got a friend -- a D.D. -- got into lapidary. I'll introduce you. You have to pass a test.
letour,Lapi --?
robert,"Gems, you know, crystals, diamonds."
letour,Any more about the Park murder?
ann, What's with this thing?
robert,Stay away.
ann, You want in? We'll make a place for you.
letour,No.
ann,It's --
eddie," ""Ann, this is Ed. You gotta come. The other thing is over. I'll be"
robert,Shit.
ann, Don't answer it. Let him call all night. He's trouble. I don't want to deal with him.
letour,"It's alright, I'll go. Let me handle it."
robert,I'm sorry if --
ann, He gives you shit -- fuck him.
letour, Forget it.
robert,"We're going Chinese tonight, okay? I mean we're on a roll --"
ann,Spring roll.
letour," Sure, whatever. Surprise me."
eddie, You gotta get permission? Check with Mama?
letour,I'm calling your brother.
eddie,Huh?
letour,"Yeah, the lawyer in Bronxville. I'm gonna ask him to come over.  You've told me so much about him."
eddie," No, don't. Please, I'll give you money, anything. He doesn't understand. Whose side are you on?"
letour, Thank you.
eddie,I shoulda never called.
letour," Yeah, in the city. I'm afraid there's a medical emergency. You're going to have to come."
letour, He'll be here.
tis,"Tour, just in time. We were out. Nineteen, right?"
letour,Thirty-eight hundred -- got any hundreds?
tis,"Some, not the whole thing.  You got hundreds?"
thomas,No.
tis,"I like that about Ann. Always takes the time to grind it. If you do it, do it right."
tis," Mari, this is Tour. You got any hundreds?"
tis,"Not the talkative type. Haven't seen her in years. You know her, don't you?  You want it or not?"
letour, Yeah.
tis,See you later.

teresa, Call. Make an appointment.
letour,Open the door. You're awake anyway.  Teresa.
letour,Read me. What do you see?
teresa,Do I know you?
letour,We had a session last week. What do you see?
teresa, John?
letour,Yes. Look at me.
teresa,Step back.  Death.
letour,Someone I knew died tonight.
teresa,This was not an accident. This person was murdered.
letour,Am I in danger?
teresa, There is danger around you. It's very close. I'm sleepy.
letour,What should I do?
teresa,I can't see it.
letour,Please.  Am I lucky?
teresa,Yes. Don't be afraid. Go home.
letour,What do I owe you?
teresa,Nothing. Forget it. Let me sleep.
police switchboard, Ninth Precinct.
letour,"Bill Guidone, please. Homicide."
police switchboard, Hold on.
guidone, Guidone.
letour,This is John LeTour. Remember me?
guidone, Laundromat. Your father's got connections.
letour,"You said I should ask around, tell you something you didn't know."
guidone, I thought you'd call.
letour,"It ain't much, but it's something."
guidone, Go on.
letour,A girl died last night. Lexington Ave.
guidone, The jumper. Druggie.
letour,The news said she was alone in the apartment when she went out -- she wasn't. It's a cover-up. There was someone else.
guidone, Who?
letour,Who lives in the apartment?
guidone, You there?
letour,That's all I know. You asked me to tell you something. I told you something.
robert, Who is it?
letour,Jack. Let me in.
robert,Where have you been? We were worried.
letour,I need some sleep -- not much. I don't want to go home just yet. A little sleep first. Can I crash here? Nice place.
robert,"It's hideous. I did it years ago. I've got to throw everything out. You haven't been here?  Oh, Jack, this is Tony. I told you about him. You should talk. He's the lapidopterist -- gems."
tony, Lapidarian.
robert,Same thing.
letour,Can I?
robert,Sure.
letour,What do you know about Tis? What's his relationship to Ann?
robert,They go way back -- before me. Did you cross him?
letour,No.
robert,Don't. He's Ann's Ecstasy connection. She needs that score. What happened?
letour,Nothing.
robert,Don't mess with him.
letour,Is he dangerous?
robert,Everybody's dangerous. We heard what you did to Eddie. Ann thought it was great. She was afraid that was why you didn't come back.
letour,It was something else. Tell me if you hear anything.
robert,About what?
letour,Tis.
robert,Tis who? Ann says you want a chart done.  What's wrong?
letour, Ah...
robert, You down?
letour, You ever think about it?
robert,What?
letour,"That it'd be like this -- like, your life, you... that it would turn out this way? --"
robert,"Compared to what? My thinking this or that is going to make any difference? There's a plan unfolding. ""Will my plane crash?"" ""Does life have meaning?"" -- why ask me? Thinking's a fear of living, negative living; living's something else. You're afraid. Let the plan unfold. Stop. Stop, live one day -- one day --"
letour,-- Robert --
robert,-- day at a time.
letour, You've lost your fucking brain.
robert, I'm a drug dealer.
letour,Got a tub?
robert, Yeah.
letour,Great.
robert,There's a plastic bottle of bath oil in the cabinet. Yellow. Use it -- tell me what you think. It's a new formula.
letour,"Manny.  Jealous. ""Jell."" SOB's."
manuel, Reggae night.
letour,Burning Spear.
manuel,How'd you get in?
letour,C-C.
manuel,You buying?
letour,How's product?
manuel, How much?
letour,I got a problem. I need a piece.
manuel,Piece? Piece of what? Piece of candy?
letour,A gun.
manuel,When?
letour,Now. Anything.  Am I speaking too fast?
manuel,How much you spend?
letour,The rate. What you got?
manuel,He's got a 64 Smith-son. Detective Special. Nobody wants 'em. Fresh from a cop.
letour,How much?
manuel, Four -- including me.
letour,You're fucking me.
manuel, Street price.
letour,Where is it?
manuel,Sigame.
manuel,The hundreds -- Franklins.
letour,How do you use this?
manuel,Automatic.
letour,I don't have much use for a gun. Never used one like this.
manuel, Cono!
letour, What do you do?
manuel,"Simple. You put the bullets in --  you point it at the bad guys, pull the trigger and they fall down!"
manuel,Vaya con Dios.
letour,-- Dios.
letour,Have you been to the police station?
randi, I thought she was playing for attention.
letour,I didn't know.
randi,You're not to blame. Don't blame yourself. You weren't responsible. She was always -- she loved you.
letour, She loved you. You were what she wanted to be.
randi,She scared me.
letour,Look. Do you recognize anyone?
randi,Tis.
letour,You know him?
randi,His father's a lawyer. Did some tax things for Mom. He was at the hospital. What's that smell?
letour,It's me. Cologne. I'm a sucker for that cheap airplane stuff. Did Marianne mention him yesterday?
randi, It was his apartment. What are you thinking?
letour,I don't know.
randi,"She jumped.  You loved her, but she -- this sounds terrible but it's true -- she was... she ruined everything... bad luck."
letour, When's the funeral -- your mother's?
randi,Tomorrow. Will you come?
letour," Well, I got this thing to do. It's -- I don't know if I can get away."
randi,Try? For me.
letour,I'll try.
ann,The Prodigal Son.
letour,Sorry about last night. Something came up.
ann,Where were you?
letour,T.C.T.E.
robert,"""Too Complicated To Explain."""
letour," I'm $500 short from last night. I'll get it, you can take it from my salary."
ann, It's not money.
letour, Sorry.
robert,"Look at this.  We had a graphic artist make it up -- you know, Billy, Five Towns."
ann,The label for the cosmetics line.
letour, Classy. Sorta -- Katmandu...
ann, Kathmandu.
letour,I love it.
robert,Tis called twice. He wants you to come by.
letour, Me?
ann,"Yeah. Says you were supposed to show up again yesterday, but didn't."
letour,A lie. I don't want to go. The suicide and all. Let's stay away.
ann,Can't. He's the Ecstasy connect. No way I can fuck this.
letour,C'mon...
ann,This is business.
letour,Let Robert go.
ann,Tis won't deal with fags.
letour,Since when?
ann,Just is -- so he's a bigot? What's new? So's everybody else.
letour,I don't want to go. I got a bad vibe.
robert,He said you.
ann, Why?
letour, Why don't you go? He's your contact.
robert,He is --
ann, You giving orders?
robert," No, Missy."
letour, Come with me -- the two of us.
letour,Okay.
robert,Stop it. You're breaking my heart.
ann,"It's going to be strange, not doing this. I mean I've had it, but sometimes..."
letour,"You're gonna do it, aren't you? You're gonna quit."
ann," I think so. Seal this thing with Tis, turn it -- go with the cosmetics. You gotta take a chance in life. No risk, no gain. I've already got retail connections here, London. It was great at the beginning, though."
letour,When?
ann,"You know, when we first started out of the place on Greene Street. Before deliveries, when you were still using. It was open house every night but Sunday. We had everything: uppers, downers, meth, six kinds of hash, all in that trousseau, remember? You could get in for a gram, stay all night -- everybody, music people, movies, Wall Street, fashion -- even politics. I think like five marriages came out of those parties, babies -- really. God.  You stayed, you then Robert -- but he... I'da never thought you'd, what is it, twelve years? Others, lucky a year max, eight months, in, out, start using, unreliable -- nice kids. Remember when you first came: long hair, dirty fingers --"
letour, You made me --
ann,-- never washed --
letour,-- khaki pants.
ann,"I should write a book someday. Did you know somebody wanted to do my story? Ghostwrite. It was impossible, of course -- my lawyer freaked I even had the meeting. People envy me. They think my life is so glamorous, but they don't know. I know. Glamorous.  It was for a while. Then came crack and fucked everything."
letour,I gotta stop home a second.
ann,Why? It's out of the way. They're expecting you.
letour,You know I got a bad vibe about Tis.
ann, Chill. This is routine.
letour,I want to get my lucky jacket.
ann,Oh. Okay.
ann,"That took long enough. What did you do, douche while you were at it?"
letour,"Ann, you got some mouth on you."
ann,You don't want to know where it's been.  Cologne?
letour,For you.
ann,Phew. It smells like that stuff they give you on airplanes. It's no good for your skin. All chemicals.
ann,What's that?
letour,Do me a favor.
ann,What?
letour,"Don't ask why, just promise."
ann,What is it?
letour," If anything happens to me -- if I should like, you know, fucking die -- write and tell her."
letour,"It's my sister. Her husband's in San Quentin. She worries, you know."
ann, Okay.
letour,I thought we were going to Tis'?
ann,"We are. He's here. He can't very well work out of his apartment after what happened yesterday, can he?"
letour,Tis there?
ann,Twelve-oh-four.
letour, Ann.
ann,"I told you greasy fucks I don't deal with guns! I see guns, I walk! How dare you?"
ann,"And you, beaner, whoever the fuck you are, kiss my fat ass!  Let's go."
thomas, Hold it! Stop right there.
tis, Sorry about the guns. My fuck-up. I was just trying to make a point -- I apologize.
tis, Right?
letour, Go on.
tis,"Tour and I need to get our stories straight. Somebody's talking to the police. The guns were for emphasis, to make a point, dumb --"
ann," Johnny, come with me."
tis, Thomas.
tis, Nothing will happen to Tour.
ann, Fire! Fire! Fire!
tis, I didn't --
letour,Hello.
ann,Hi.
letour,Twenty minutes. You look terrific.
ann,I look respectable. Any news?
letour,"Sentencing's in ten days -- supposed to be. Because of the extenuating circumstances -- our cooperation -- they say it won't be more than five years -- maybe seven. With time served, good behavior, parole, I could be out in two years -- maybe. I hope."
ann,It feels like forever.
letour,"It's not so bad. It's a relief in a way -- at least so far. I've been writing, reading."
ann,I love your letters. 
letour,How's business?
ann,"Robert quit. He went back to dealing. I think he thought it would be less work, more money. It's lucky in a way I got mixed up in it -- now I have to see this thing through. So it's cosmetics after all."
letour, I miss you.
ann,Me too.
letour,Did we ever fuck?
ann,What do you mean?
letour,"You know, make love."
ann," There was that party when everybody was so stoned, but -- oh yeah, that night you came over and crashed and we slept together."
letour,"We were naked, but did we --?"
ann,You had a hard-on...
letour,I didn't --
ann,You tried...
letour,I was thinking about it and I realized we never really did. It's one of the things I think about. It's one of the things I look forward to. I've been looking forward.
ann,Me too.
letour, Something can be right in front of you and you can't see it.
ann, Strange how things work.
