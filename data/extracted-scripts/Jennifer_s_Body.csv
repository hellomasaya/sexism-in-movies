Speaker,Dialogue
raymundo,"Rec time in five minutes, Needy."
needy,"Grassy-ass, Raymundo."
2.,"CONTINUED: NEEDY V.O.  Like I'd really date some perverted Chester with a hard-on for jailbait. I might be insane, but I'm not desperate."
needy, I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner.
3.,CONTINUED: NEEDY V.O.  Even the cutters get in on the action when they're fully conscious.
nutritionist,"Just one Toastem, huh? NEEDY  I like Toastems. NUTRITIONIST That's good. But I'm not sure a Toastem can provide you with sufficient energy for your day. I'd recommend more complex carbohydrates..."
4.,CONTINUED:
5.,CONTINUED:
6.,"CONTINUED: NEEDY V.O.  Maybe it's another dimension. Or, you know, just really deep."
7.,CONTINUED:
8.,CONTINUED: 
jennifer," Needy? Needy drops the boxcutter. It lands on Jennifer's copy of Flag Team Quarterly, splashing the model with fresh gore."
needy,"Is she dead, Mrs. Check? Did I get her?"
9.,CONTINUED: 
roman,"Christ, Needy, what have you done?"
needy,Everything's going to be okay now. I rule. FEMALE COP Shut your mouth back there! NEEDY Hey. Didn't you used to baby-sit me in like 1998? When my mom worked the overnight at Hormel? The female cop fidgets uncomfortably. 
10.,CONTINUED:
needy,"Ugh, don't say attempted. That sounds so JV. Small time. Teeny- weeny, just like Officer Duda up there. And trust me-- I'd know. Roman swallows nervously, eyes on the road. Officer Warzak glances at him."
11.,CONTINUED: 
female cop,"At least we've already got a confession. NEEDY Confessions are for pussies. You've got a declaration, Grace. She giggles maniacally. Roman turns on the radio, violating protocol. It's a soaring rock anthem-- the SAME SONG we heard being piped into solitary confinement."
roman,"They're way more than a band, really. They're heroes. FEMALE COP Wait, this is my favorite part... Roman and the female cop begin to sing along with the uplifting, corny song:"
12.,"CONTINUED:  We were our yearbook pictures. Nothing more, nothing less."
13.,CONTINUED:
chastity,Of what? That rich bitch? NEEDY She's not rich.
14.,"CONTINUED: JENNIFER  And it's all-ages, for once, which means I won't have to play Hello Titty with the door guy. NEEDY What's Soft Shoulder?"
jennifer,"They're this indie band from the city. I saw their MySpace and the singer is extra salty. And there will be lots of other salty morsels there for you. Come on Needy, it's the weekend! NEEDY It's Thursday."
jennifer,Thursday counts as the weekend in college. And we're going to be in college twenty-three months from now. University of Northern Minnesota Duluth- woo! Needy continues loading her backpack. JENNIFER  Boo! Cross out Needy!
needy,He seems nice.
15.,CONTINUED: 
jennifer," Yeah, Mom says he's got a huge... heart. So huge he gave her a recurring bladder infection. Wear something cool, okay? NEEDY Okay."
chip,"I can see, like, your womb. Needy sighs and hoists up her pants. CHIP  Why are you blowing me off for some dumb concert, anyway? We were supposed to have Movie Night. I even rented Orca. It's like Jaws, except with a harmless whale."
16.,CONTINUED:
needy,"Jennifer needs me. She really wants to go see this band. It's extremely important to her. CHIP I've never even heard of Soft Shoulder. Which one is Jennifer stalking? NEEDY The lead singer, of course. Girls like her don't go out with drummers. CHIP Thanks a lot! NEEDY No offense. I mean, she'd probably make an exception for a drummer who was also the lead singer. CHIP Like Phil Collins. NEEDY Who's Phil Collins? CHIP Forget it. He's seminal, but whatever..."
needy,"Anyway, this singer guy is like 22, so he could get locked up in the state pen if he actually dated her. But Jennifer says he's extra salty, so... CHIP Salty. You guys ever going to stop using that secret language?"
needy,"""Salty"" means beautiful. CHIP Then you must be soy sauce, babe. Needy and CHIP start MAKING OUT. CHIP unbuckles his belt eagerly even though they've barely begun. Needy stops."
17.,CONTINUED: 
needy,"Jennifer's here. CHIP How do you know? Needy shrugs. A beat of silence. Then we hear the door swing open. JENNIFER'S VOICE floats up from downstairs. JENNIFER  I'd better hurry. CHIP You always do what Jennifer tells you to do. Needy pulls her NECKLACE out from beneath her shirt and flashes a heart-shaped ""B.F.F."" charm at Chip."
needy,"She's my best friend, Chip. Remember? This necklace is no joke. CHIP sighs, resigned. They head downstairs."
needy,Wow.
18.,CONTINUED:
jennifer,"You're lucky you get to ride with me to the club in style! She does a sexy little dance in the doorway, then notices CHIP."
needy,I think she remembered two buttons.
19.,CONTINUED: 
jennifer,You're totally jello! You're lime green jello and you can't even admit it. The girls scamper toward the car.
chip, Stop kidnapping my girlfriend!
needy,I don't think so.
20.,CONTINUED:
jennifer,"Peach schnapps are excellent. They even taste good when they come out of your nose mid-puke. A teenage guy, CRAIG, passes by and waves."
craig,"Hi Jennifer. You look nice. JENNIFER  He thinks he's cute enough for me. No wonder he's in retard math. Jennifer pulls out a pack of Camel Wides and lights one awkwardly. Needy notices AHMET FROM INDIA, a FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENT, standing by himself away from the crowd. NEEDY Hey, it's Ahmet from India. The foreign exchange guy. He's all by himself."
jennifer,"I can't believe we traded a cute hockey player for that. NEEDY He seems okay. He's got that cool elephant statue in his locker. JENNIFER Do you think he's circumcised? I always wanted to try sea cucumber. NEEDY Ew! ROMAN DUDA saunters up to Jennifer, swigging a bottle of beer. He snatches the pack of cigarettes away from her. ROMAN You're smoking dicks now, Jen? JENNIFER What? I like the Wides."
21.,CONTINUED: 
jennifer,"Arrest me, pfft! You're not even out of the academy yet, Roman! ROMAN Two more months and I'm on the force for real. Then I'll be able to cuff you whenever the hell I want. He grips her wrist and twists it behind her back. JENNIFER How will I wait that long? She paws Roman's crotch discreetly. Needy winces. ROMAN Not here, babe. I gotta keep my nose clean. NEEDY  Look, there's the band!"
22.,CONTINUED: 
needy,"They look so-- so cool. She gazes at the stage, hearing only the whistling rush of ARCTIC AIR. In SLOW MOTION, the GUITARIST unsheathes his Fender Jaguar from its gig bag. He notices her staring and runs the tip of his tongue over his lips. Needy swallows hard. JENNIFER Hey, I think they need two groupies. Come on! It'll be like Almost Famous! I'll be Penny Lane and you can be the other girl. She grabs Needy's hand and enthusiastically tries to drag her toward the stage."
needy,No!
jennifer,"Don't be J.V., Needy. They're just boys. Morsels. We have all the power, don't you know that? She plants her hands on Needy's CHEST. JENNIFER  These things are like smart bombs. Point `em in the right direction and shit gets real."
23.,CONTINUED: 
jennifer," Yeah! Soft Shoulder, right? I've heard you guys are super, super good at playing your instruments. NIKOLAI I hope we can live up to such...high praise. NEEDY Hey, if you don't mind me asking, why did you want to play all the way out here in Devil's Kettle? You live in the city, right? NIKOLAI Yeah. But I think it's so important to connect with our fans in rural areas. Plus, the audiences in small towns really appreciate us. JENNIFER Can I show you my appreciation right now? Needy looks at the floor, embarrassed."
24.,CONTINUED: 
25.,CONTINUED: 
jennifer,I think the singer wants me. NEEDY Only because he thinks you're a virgin. I heard them talking.
jennifer,"Yeah, right! I'm not even a backdoor-virgin anymore, thanks to Roman. By the way, that hurts. I couldn't even go to flags the next day. I had to stay home and sit on a bag of frozen peas. NEEDY Oh my God."
jennifer,"Well, if Nikolai wants innocent, I can do innocent. I'll be Little Miss Fucking Sunshine. NEEDY He's way too old for you. JENNIFER Don't cock-block me, Needy."
26.,CONTINUED: 
needy," and boost each other out the BATHROOM WINDOW. Hundreds are still trapped inside, screaming."
jennifer," It's so hot, Needy. I think I'm on fire. Oh God, I'm burning!"
needy,"You're okay, I promise. You got burned worse when you wore that tin-foil bikini to the beach. Everything's fine. Suddenly, a HAND clamps onto Jennifer's shoulder. Both girls jump. It's Nikolai, his forehead creased with false concern. NIKOLAI Are you girls all right?"
27.,CONTINUED:
jennifer,Okay...okay... She slumps against Nikolai's chest.
nikolai,"You're in shock. Here, drink this. You'll feel better. He smoothly retrieves a plastic bottle of PEACH SCHNAPPS from his coat and holds it to Jennifer's lips. She swigs it cooperatively, dribbling down her chin."
28.,CONTINUED: 
jennifer," I want to see your van. C'mon Needy, let's go to the van. NEEDY Why? Why should we? We have the Malibu. Let's just get out of here. We can go to El Ojo and get Northwoods Nachos with extra Badger Sauce! Please? I'm starving. JENNIFER Needy, stop it. Just stop it! She defiantly follows Nikolai toward the WHITE VAN, which is parked a suspiciously safe distance from the bar. Needy staggers after them slowly, watching. Behind Needy, the bar EXPLODES. Screams. Flames. Silence. Needy doesn't even look back as she watches Jennifer get into the van. Ash drifts into her hair like snowflakes."
cross cut,PHONE CALL:
chip,"Like, burned down? To the ground? Is everyone okay?"
needy,"No. I think they're mostly dead. CHIP Shit. You're okay, right? NEEDY We went out the bathroom window. Everyone else was trying to use the door. It was like a stampede. The people who fainted got run over and you could hear their bones breaking. "
30.,"CONTINUED: NEEDY  There was all this screaming and popping, like a million Black Cats all going off at once. And the smell... CHIP This is real, right? This isn't just, like, some crazy dream like last time? NEEDY No! Anyway, it took me like an hour to walk home. But Jennifer's still with those creeps! They had one of those white molester vans with no windows. The back was all blacked out."
chip,Who cares about Jennifer and those douchebags with douchebag haircuts? People just burned to death. In our town!
needy," Oh cheese and fries! Someone's here. I'm alone, Chip. I'm freaked out!"
chip,"Where's your mom? NEEDY Swing shift. Listen, I'll call you in a minute. Stay awake. CHIP  Holla back. Needy hangs up the phone and rushes downstairs. As she passes through the shadowy kitchen, appliances HUM all around her. The silence is menacing."
31.,CONTINUED:
needy,"Um, Jennifer? Jennifer says nothing and continues to smile with blood- tinged teeth. NEEDY  J-Jen?"
32.,CONTINUED: 
jennifer, Jennifer! But she's long gone.
gossiping girl, I heard Needy and Jennifer were there and they had to fight their way out with a machete.
other girl,"Look, she's not even moving. GOSSIPING GIRL It's called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder... Suddenly, a figure steps in front of Needy. It's JENNIFER, looking absolutely gorgeous-- and remarkably unscathed. She smiles brightly at Needy as if nothing happened the night before. JENNIFER Happy Friday!, D-bag! NEEDY You-- you're all right!"
33.,CONTINUED:
jennifer,Yeah. Why wouldn't I be? NEEDY Last night. At my house. You were hurt. You had two black eyes and blood everywhere and...
jennifer,"Needy, you're delusional. I got a little banged up when you made me go out that window, but I'm fine. NEEDY  We had to go out that window. The bar was like, engulfed in flames! JENNIFER You do have a tendency to overreact. Remember at Girl Scout camp when you thought there was an earthquake and it was really just two guys with a ghetto blaster?"
needy,"A lot of people died, Jennifer. They burned to death, or they choked, or they just got trampled. More than half of the people there didn't make it out. It's like, all over the news. National news. Kids are dead. Parents are dead."
jennifer,Anyone we know?
needy,"We know everyone! JENNIFER Sucks to be them, I guess. She giggles and reaches for her knockoff designer purse. NEEDY I don't get it. What's wrong with you? Jennifer applies lip gloss and smacks her lips together."
jennifer,"What's wrong with you? I mean, besides the obvious surface flaws. "
34.,CONTINUED: 
needy,"Work, you...twat! Swiff, darn it! Swiff! Swiff!"
35.,CONTINUED:
36.,CONTINUED: 
needy,"Chip, I need to tell you something kind of weird. It's about Jennifer. CHIP What? NEEDY You know last night when we were talking and someone came to my door? That was Jennifer. But she didn't talk. She just stood there, smiling at me, but a bad kind of smile. She looked like she'd been beat up or shot or something. She was all bloody. "
37.,CONTINUED: NEEDY  And then she barfed up this disgusting prickly stuff that was like roadkill and sewing needles all mixed together. She shudders at the memory
chip,"Yuck. Like those porcupine meatballs my mom makes with the rice sticking out? NEEDY Yeah, like almost that bad! CHIP and Needy ponder the grotesque image in silence. CHIP It was probably because she inhaled a whole bunch of smoke."
needy,No. It was something evil.
chip,"You might want    to talk to the school shrink,    Needy. I'm not saying that to    be a dillhole. I'm actually kinda    concerned."
needy,"Chip, I'm a National Merit Scholar. I don't tell whoppers and I'm not crazy. CHIP I didn't say you were crazy. It's just that everyone's a little messed up about this. It's okay to feel... NEEDY Discombobulated? CHIP Yeah, you know. Fucked up. As they prepare to leave, COLIN GRAY approaches Needy. He's a cute PUNK/GOTH guy wearing black nail polish, a lip ring, and full wardrobe by Hot Topic. COLIN Hi Needy."
38.,CONTINUED: 
needy,Thanks.
chip,You know it.
39.,"CONTINUED: It's a gray, overcast fall day and the wind whistles eerily through the trees. The football is set back a good a distance from the school, and Jonas is all alone. In the distance, a tiny figure slowly approaches, It starts a dot on the horizon. As it draws closer, we see it's JENNIFER. Her bright, lipsticked grin is eerie and unmistakable. Jonas glances briefly over his right shoulder, indifferent. A few seconds later, he glances again. Strangely, Jennifer ISN'T THERE. Jennifer suddenly appears on Jonas's left side, startling him."
jennifer,Hi!
jonas," Oh. Hey, Jennifer. JENNIFER I'm crazy-sorry about your profound loss. You are crying about Craig, right?"
jonas,"He was my best friend. Jennifer puts her arm around him sympathetically. JENNIFER I know. I was close to him too. You know, I was there last night in that horrible place. I saw Craig a few minutes before the fire broke out. JONAS You-- you did? JENNIFER Yeah. I was probably the last person to talk to him. Like, ever. Literally. JONAS Wow. What did he say?"
40.,CONTINUED: 
jennifer,"Well, we got to talking about you, actually. And do you know what he said? He said you were like a brother to him. Not a bro. An actual brother."
jennifer,"Well, he said he always thought you and me would make a totally bangin' couple. Isn't that so weird?"
jonas,"He said bangin'? Jennifer reaches for Jonas's hand and slides it slowly up her shirt, placing it on her left breast."
jennifer, Mine too.
41.,CONTINUED: 
jennifer,"Come with me. Just for a while. We'll help each other get through this nightmare. It's what Craig would have wanted. Jonas nods dumbly, brainwashed. Jennifer leads him away from the field, toward the WOODS bordering the school campus. They vanish into the woods. In the distance, we see the FALLS rushing into the lake."
jonas,"Look! He gestures to the ANIMALS, who are watching, still as statues. A few crows alight on a nearby tree. JENNIFER Mm-hmm. They're waiting. JONAS Uh, okay... Jennifer unzips Jonas's jeans and smiles, reaching down and working him with her hand. Jonas moans, still eyeing the animals. JENNIFER Do you miss Craig? "
43.,CONTINUED:
jonas, Of course. JENNIFER Don't worry. You're going to see your buddy again.
jonas,"You mean like in heaven someday? JENNIFER No. She smiles and shakes her head. Jonas jerks back, creeped out. He tries to pull away from Jennifer, but she's too strong. She PINS him to the tree. We see her jaw begin to UNHINGE, like some horrible snake. Her eyes cloud over with blood..."
44.,CONTINUED:
needy,"Fried bologna is the bomb!  Something's wrong... As Needy sinks to her knees, she stares straight ahead at the REFRIGERATOR. A photo magnet of JENNIFER leers back at her."
45.,CONTINUED:
toni,"You said it. NEEDY Oh, hi, Mom. I didn't know you were awake."
toni,I just had one of my night terrors.
needy,"It's four o' clock, so technically you had a day terror. TONI Right, right. I'm all mixed up since I started working swing again. NEEDY What did you dream about? TONI I dreamed some bad people were trying to nail me to a tree with hammers and big stakes and shit. Just like Jesus. She crosses herself piously. "
46.,CONTINUED:
toni,That's what you think. One of these days you're gonna be crying out for me and I might not be there.
needy,Hey Mom? Did you get a chance to catch the news after you clocked out this morning?
toni,"No. I just did my scratch tickets, snorted a few Lunesta and went straight to bed. Is something going on? NEEDY Nothing. Forget it. TONI Don't nothing happen in Devil's Kettle."
48.,CONTINUED:
jennifer,"I feel sooo scrumptious! She picks up a Soft Shoulder button and POKES her arm hard with the pin without flinching. Blood spurts from the wound. NEEDY Good for you. JENNIFER You know, like when you kiss a hot guy for the first time and your whole body feels like it's on vibrate. NEEDY Yeah. JENNIFER It's that good. Jennifer gazes at her arm, transfixed. She wipes the blood away-- the wound has magically DISAPPEARED."
49.,CONTINUED:
needy,"Lucky you. See, I'm still kind of depressed about, you know, the giant smoldering funeral pyre in the middle of town? JENNIFER Move-on dot org, Needy! It's over. Life's too short to mope over some white-trash pig roast. She flicks a Zippo lighter and touches the FLAME to her tongue-- first tentatively, then confidently."
needy,"That's really nice. JENNIFER I tell it like it is. Besides, you should be happy for me. I'm having the best day since, like Jesus invented the calendar. NEEDY Jesus didn't invent the calendar."
50.,CONTINUED: 
chip,"I need to see you right now. NEEDY I can barely hear you. CHIP Camille is playing piano. Knock it off, Camille! CAMILLE You knock it off!"
chip,Can you meet me at McCullum in ten?
camille,"You knock it off, Chip! You're penis cheese!"
needy,"Fifteen. Back on JENNIFER: Jennifer is impatiently dragging a razor down her arm. Blood drips onto the rug. She smiles, in awe of herself."
51.,CONTINUED: 
needy,"What?! Like, he was shot by gangbangers? CHIP  Someone ripped Jonas limb from limb in the woods behind the school. Ate parts of him. They found teethmarks on him-- on the body. His voice cracks. We see a brief, terrifying FLASH of Jonas's mutilated body and pain-stricken face. Needy doesn't want to believe it. NEEDY Some animals must've got to him. CHIP Human teethmarks."
needy,Who would do that?
52.,CONTINUED:
chip,"I don't know. It just happened after school. No one's supposed to know yet, but my dad went over there and talked to the cops. Jonas's mom is catatonic. She's just staring out the front window like a zombie mannequin robot statue. NEEDY This can't be a coincidence. CHIP What do you mean, Needy? NEEDY A fiery death trap last night, and now a cannibal eats our starting tight-end? Come on!"
chip,"Don't get spooky on me, babe."
needy,"Seriously Chip. Most small towns only have something gruesome happen like, once every decade maybe. Devil's Kettle gets two nightmares in 24 hours? It's freaktarded. It's not right. CHIP What, do you think it's, like supernatural?"
needy,"I don't know. I'm extremely intelligent but I obviously don't know everything. CHIP Well, the bad luck's gotta be over now, right? It can't get any worse, right? Obviously it can't. It can't. I mean, you agree, right? There won't be another victim. NEEDY You're shaking. CHIP I'm cold. It's very cold out here. "
53.,CONTINUED: 
needy,"Want my sweater? CHIP It's pink. NEEDY Pink is cool. Rap guys wear pink. She's shaking now, too. Chip leans forward and kisses her. She closes her eyes. In the chaste space between CHIP and Needy's bodies, the volleyball-pit couple fuck like rabbits. DISSOLVE TO:"
54.,CONTINUED:
55.,"CONTINUED: MR. WROBLEWSKI  As you know, this is the one month anniversary of the Carousel fire and also the murder of Jonas Kozelle... JENNIFER Bo-ring!"
56.,"CONTINUED:  3% of the profits will go to local families who have been affected by loss. The class is happily abuzz-- except Needy, who looks appalled."
needy,"What about the other 97%? MR. WROBLEWSKI Excuse me? NEEDY The other 97%. I mean, that's just crass. Right? She looks around for support, finding none."
57.,CONTINUED: 
chastity," You take that back, Needy Lesnicki! We need them now more then ever!"
jennifer,"I'm fine. It's just, like, wearing off or something. NEEDY What's wearing off? "
58.,CONTINUED:
jennifer,"Oh, hey Colin. Listen, can I copy your bio lab again? I never got around to dissecting that kitten fetus. COLIN Sure. Actually, I sort of wanted to ask you something. JENNIFER Oh. You want to know if I'll go out with you. COLIN No! Well-- yeah.  How did you know?"
jennifer,Just go ahead with the pitch. Colin fidgets awkwardly.
colin,"Well, we've been having a lot of fun in class, you and I, and I just thought maybe we could go to a movie or something. There's a midnight showing of Rocky Horror at the Bijou next weekend..."
jennifer,"I don't like boxing movies. COLIN It's not...fuck it. Never mind. He turns to walk down the hallway, dejected. Jennifer watches him leave. JENNIFER Wait! Colin turns around. JENNIFER  Why don't you just come by my place tonight? I just got Aquamarine on DVD. It's about this girl who's like, half-sushi. I guess she has sex through her blowhole or something."
59.,CONTINUED: 
colin,"Oh. Great! Okay. JENNIFER I'll text you my address. Colin walks away, grinning triumphantly."
needy,That was random. JENNIFER I'm used to guys asking me out. NEEDY Colin's a really nice guy. JENNIFER He's into maggot-rock. He wears nail polish.
chip,Hi. JENNIFER  I gotta go parlez French. Slam you later.
chip,Can I come over tonight?
60.,CONTINUED: 
needy,Sure. I'd like that. CHIP I went to Super Target and bought more condoms.
needy,"Thanks. CHIP Not that that has anything to do with my coming over. NEEDY I didn't assume that. CHIP Well, I'll see you tonight. Needy waves as Chip walks away."
61.,CONTINUED:
colin,Yo? He stumbles over a stray 2 x 4. There are piles of sawdust and building materials everywhere-- the house is definitely still under construction. Colin looks confused. A MOUSE skitters over his sneakers. COLIN  Jennifer? Anyone there? The music upstairs grows slightly louder in response.
jennifer,"You made it. COLIN What's going on? This isn't really your house, is it? JENNIFER No baby. This is our house, just for you and me. We can play Mommy and Daddy. Colin is totally dumbstruck. COLIN Do you even know my last name? JENNIFER Silly. I've been sending you signals all year. Couldn't you tell? You give me such a wettie."
63.,CONTINUED:
64.,CONTINUED:
jennifer,"I need you frightened. Colin tries to jerk away, but Jennifer easily disengages his arm from its socket. A sickeningly moist SNAP. Colin cries out in pain."
chip,"What? Am I hurting you? Needy starts weeping. CHIP  Am I too big? Tears roll down Needy's cheeks. She begins moaning, then SCREAMING at that top of her lungs."
65.,CONTINUED:
needy, It's her. CHIP Do you need more foreplay?
66.,CONTINUED:
needy,"I have to go. I'm sorry. I just... feel like something...something terrible... CHIP You feel-- What does that even mean? I'm worried about you. NEEDY I'm so sorry, Chip. I'm so sorry. Everything is just wrong. She bolts out the room, leaving Chip naked and alone. He pulls his knees up to his chest, vulnerable."
67.,CONTINUED:
little jennifer,I'll be Perfect Prom Barbie and you be her.
68.,CONTINUED:
little needy,Why do I have to be Ugly Ashley?
little jennifer,You can be Ugly Ashley or Ken. Choose.
little needy,"What's wrong, Jennifer?"
little jennifer,OWWWWWW!  Damn! Ass!
little needy,Better. We should get a Band-Aid though.
little jennifer,"We're sisters now, you know."
needy,I never tell on you.
needy,What the fuck is happening? JENNIFER Whoa. I have never heard you drop the F-bomb before. What's buggin'?
needy,"I saw you! I saw you! The car...the...I... JENNIFER  Buh-buh-buh. Slow down, tardy slip. You sound like a sped. NEEDY I'm calling the police. JENNIFER Go ahead, narc me out. I've got the cops in my back pocket. I'm fucking a cadet, remember?"
70.,CONTINUED:
needy,"What do you want? JENNIFER I want to explain some things to you. You've already seen too much and besides-- best friends don't keep secrets. Right? Needy nods, terrified. JENNIFER  Remember the night of the fire? NEEDY Yeah, it rings a bell. JENNIFER Well, I got pretty messed up. I almost died. You know those guys in Soft Shoulder? Totally evil. They're basically agents of Satan with awesome haircuts. I figured that out as soon as I got into their molester van."
jennifer,Guys? Where are we going?
nikolai,"Shut your mouth, object."
dirk, Nikolai...
71.,CONTINUED:
jennifer,Are you guys rapists?!
nikolai,You wish.
mick, Hey guys? Do we even know if she's a virgin?
jennifer,Yes...yes! Of course I'm a virgin! I've never done sex ever. I don't even know how. So maybe you should find some other girl who does. Know how.
nikolai,"Told you, Dirk. You owe me a beer."
dirk," Sure, man."
nikolai,We got a waxing moon. Perfection.
mick,"You're the man, Wolf."
dirk,I don't know if we should go through with this.
nikolai, Do you want to be rich and famous like the guy from Maroon 5? Or do you want to be a huge suicidal loser?
nikolai,Then grow a pair and fetch me the ritual! God.
mick,That's it?
nikolai,What? I found it on Google.
73.,CONTINUED:
jennifer, My name is Jennifer.
nikolai,That's fascinating.
jennifer,Please let me go. I'll do anything. Anything you want.
nikolai,"I only hump nines and tens. You're a seven at best, even with the chicken cutlets."
74.,"CONTINUED:  But that's not enough, Jenny. We want designer drugs. We want groupies that have their own groupies. We want speedballs and stadium tours and Skittles sorted by color. In short, we want more. And to get more, we have to butcher you. And bleed you."
jennifer," Maybe you could just hire a publicist. Make some T-shirts or something. Hey, I could be on your street team!"
nikolai,"Sorry, darling."
jennifer,Please...
nikolai," Start chanting, boys."
dirk,"Dude, that is a hot murder weapon!"
nikolai,It's a bowie knife.

75.,CONTINUED: 
jennifer,"Being tortured would make most girls black out or something. But I'm so hard core, I was with them the whole time. I could feel them gutting me Under my ribs, up into my belly, then right through my heart. NEEDY They...killed you."
jennifer,"I'm here, aren't I? She shakes her head, annoyed with Needy."
jennifer,Ahmet. You made it out.
77.,CONTINUED:
78.,CONTINUED:
jennifer,You should talk to someone about these disturbing thoughts you're having. We're all concerned. Especially Chip. I think he's having second thoughts about you.
needy," Leave! JENNIFER My, aren't we a C-U-Next-Tuesday? NEEDY GET OUT! JENNIFER Come on. Let me stay the night. We can play ""boyfriend/girlfriend"" like we used to. She smiles seductively."

priest,"Children, this is a private service for family only. GOTH GIRL  No. It's fine."
goth girl,Is it true that Colin had a date with Jennifer Check the night he was killed?
81.,"CONTINUED:  I'll spell her preppy ass right into the ground! The parents flinch. GOTH BOY Um, Chloe? Maybe you should be mad at the person who murdered Colin. All Jennifer Check did was invite him over to watch Aquamarine. GOTH GIRL That's WORSE! She throws herself to the ground, crying and pounding the dirt like a toddler. Colin Gray's mother buries her head in her hands and begins weeping. Mr. Gray attempts to comfort her."
goth boy,"Colin wouldn't have liked this. MRS. GRAY  Oh, you think so, Powder? Yeah, you're right! I'm pretty sure my son wouldn't have liked being eaten by a fucking CANNIBAL and buried before his eighteenth birthday! Wow, you must have known him so well! MR. GRAY Jill... The goth boy looks terrified. But Mrs. Gray's not done ranting yet. MRS. GRAY By the time they found Colin in that godforsaken house, he looked like lasagna with teeth. I'd know-- I had to identify the remains. My boy's not in the realm of the undead. He's not flying around in the firmament with magical wings of flame. He's in an overpriced rosewood box that's headed six feet downtown. She kicks the coffin to illustrate."

needy,I gotta show you something. CHIP What is it? NEEDY Not here. Behind the school. CHIP What is it? NEEDY Evidence. CHIP  Is this about Jennifer?
needy,"Yes, but I promise you this is the last thing I need to show y-- CHIP  Needy, I care about you. A lot. As a person, not just a girl I made love to for four minutes the other night. And I'm scared of what's happening to you. You're acting really fucked up. NEEDY Please just let me show you. Her gaze is so intense and crazed that Chip has no option but to submit. He nods reluctantly."
needy,Look at this. She thrusts a piece of paper into CHIP's hands.

chip," ""If the human sacrifice is impure, the result may still be attained, but a demon will forever reside the soul of the victim. She must forever feed on flesh to sustain the demon."" See? CHIP looks more dubious than ever."
chip,"Uh-huh. NEEDY She's eating boys! They make her strong. Really strong. And when she's hungry, she gets weak and cranky and her hair is all full of split ends. And look at this... She holds up one of the printouts. NEEDY  It says that before the demon feeds, it vomits a gruesome substance on its prey. Like I saw!"
85.,CONTINUED: 
chip,You--you really think Jennifer killed Jonas and Colin? NEEDY And possibly Ahmet from India.
chip,Is that what you think?
needy,"No...Listen, I'll make an appointment with Mr. Feely. I'm real sorry about this sudden onset of teenage paranoia.  My hormones and emotions are aswirl, and my moods are erratic... CHIP isn't totally convinced, but his face softens. CHIP It's all right, Needy."
needy,"This has been a crummy school year, Chip. CHIP No shit. Needy turns and pitches the black binder into a Dumpster."
needy,"Listen, I'm done with all that devil stuff. Do you know what you're wearing to Turnabout? CHIP I was thinking a suit with black shoes and a boutonniere, right here. "
86.,CONTINUED: 
chip,"What color dress are you gonna wear? I need to order your wrist corsage. NEEDY I don't know yet. CHIP How about magenta? You're definitely a winter. My mom says winters should wear regal jewel tones like magenta. Or possibly teal. NEEDY Oh yeah, your mom's an Avon lady."
chip,"Well, they call them ""sales reps"" now. NEEDY Right. Well, I'll try to find something magenta. CHIP That'll look dope."
87.,CONTINUED:
needy,"I look pork stupid. TONI No, you've got that tiny waist, like a fashion model. I always thought you looked like Cindy Crawford. She gently takes off Needy's glasses."
needy,"Who's Cindy Crawford? TONI One of the great beauties of our time. She's even got a mole like you, except hers is on her face. She takes a section of Needy's hair and wraps it around the curling iron. Smoke rises."
needy,"Ow! You're too close to my neck. TONI Well, if Chip gives you a hickey, you can just tell everyone I burned you. NEEDY Gross, Mom. Chip isn't that ostentatious."
toni,Now that's a word you don't hear every day. Hold still.
needy,What are you doing to my hair? TONI Hooker helmet.
88.,CONTINUED: 
needy," Aw, jeez Mom! TONI If you can't have big what-nots, you might as well have big hair!"
chip's mom,"I've been thinking about it for a while, and I think you need to be carrying this. There's obviously a sicko out there who likes boys. Boys your age. And I don't want you going out there unarmed. CHIP I can take care of myself. I've been using the Bowflex. In the background, we can see the BOWFLEX with clothes hanging off it. CHIP'S MOM Did you hear what Colin Gray looked like when they found him? "
89.,CONTINUED:
chip,"Lasagna with teeth? CHIP'S MOM You heard. So unless you want to wind up looking like another exotic Eye-talian dish, take Mommy's rape spray. Chip reluctantly accepts the spray. CHIP'S MOM  Are you picking Needy up at her house? CHIP Meeting her at the dance. I'm gonna walk. It's so warm outside."
chip's mom,I want pictures with your sister before you go.
chip,"Yes, ma'am."

jennifer,"I think you were maybe spacing out. You were like this: Derrrrr. She mimics a blank, drooling expression. CHIP I was? "
93.,CONTINUED:
jennifer,"Yes, exactly like that. Listen, I need to talk to you about you-know- who. Our little Needy. CHIP I know."
jennifer,"Are you worried? `Cause I'm super- stressed about her. God knows how I even sleep at night. CHIP She hasn't been the same for weeks. JENNIFER I think I know what's wrong with her. In fact, I know I know what's wrong with her."
chip,"Then tell me. JENNIFER I feel bad telling you this.  Okay, you know Needy's been a total Lithium candidate since the night Colin Gray died. But that's not just because he was brutally murdered and stuff. It's because....I don't wanna say this."
chip,Say it! JENNIFER Needy and Colin were intimate. By that I mean he was poking her donut on a semi-regular basis.
94.,CONTINUED: 
jennifer,"That's what she wants you to believe. But trust me, her and Colin were doing stuff you haven't even heard of. Total varsity moves."
chip,"But you were with Colin the night he was killed. JENNIFER Well, apparently he had a thing for me-- no surprise there. And I figured Needy was busy jumping your jock that night, so I agreed to a little pity date. Colin brought me to that empty house so we could have some privacy. But he wanted to go too far, so I left after a few minutes. Next thing I knew, they'd found... She sniffles, wiping her eye. JENNIFER  Eye-talian."
jennifer,Huh? CHIP Never mind. JENNIFER I'm sorry you had to hear this from me. I'm just so worried about Needy. She's losing her shit. Colin was her everything.
chip,I just can't believe this.
95.,CONTINUED: 
jennifer,"Well, you've been talking to her more than I have. How bad is it? CHIP It's bad, man. It's bad."
jennifer,"I can only imagine the paranoid theories she's come up with. CHIP Oh, you have no idea. JENNIFER I just can't believe she would do this to you. I care so much about you, Chip."
nikolai,"Good evening, babies. Are you ready for some bad vibrations?"
96.,CONTINUED:
97.,CONTINUED:
jennifer,"Say I'm better than Needy. CHIP What? Why? JENNIFER We really shouldn't be doing this. She pulls away from him, feigning a guilty conscience. CHIP  You're better than Needy. Jennifer smiles, satisfied. JENNIFER Natch. She resumes kissing him enthusiastically. CHIP This feels weird. Can we go somewhere else? JENNIFER I have just the place."
jennifer,You're in big trouble anyway. Come on.
98.,CONTINUED:
chip's mom, He left for the dance at least twenty minutes ago. He certainly should have been there by now.
needy,"He walked? Mrs. Dove, you mean to only tell me that in these dangerous, godless times-- you let your only son walk alone at night?"
chip's mom,"Well, it's only five blocks. My God, your hair is... NEEDY Which way did he go? CHIP'S MOM He usually cuts across the park. She turns to scold Camille. CHIP'S MOM  Camille, let's sit like a lady! No one wants to see your kiki. She turns back to address Needy."
99.,CONTINUED: 
chip,"Aren't you cold? JENNIFER Never, Trevor. I'm hot like magma. She prances over to the abandoned pool and begins to climb down the ladder on the side. The pool is full of filthy, freezing water. CHIP What are you doing? JENNIFER Swimming. CHIP Ha ha."
jennifer,"Come on in, Chip. Show me your breast stroke. CHIP The water looks disgusting. JENNIFER It's not so bad."
chip,Are you kidding? It's totally bubonic in there. I think I see a dead possum with a Doritos bag in its pouch. And that looks like a used syringe over there... He slaps away a FLY.
100.,CONTINUED:
jennifer,"I'm sorry. I was just trying to make you laugh. I think now, more than ever, we need laughter. We've both lost a close friend. CHIP nods sadly."
chip,"I know. JENNIFER I feel so empty. CHIP Me too. JENNIFER Please come here and kiss me again. Make all this madness go away. Chip tiptoes forward tentatively and sinks to his knees. He leans in and kisses Jennifer, who's still clinging to the ladder. The sound of buzzing flies grows louder. Suddenly, Jennifer opens her eyes. She hooks her arm around Chip's neck and lunges backward. They tumble off the ladder, into the pool. Chip SCREAMS."

jennifer,"Fuck this J.V. shit! Jennifer ROCKETS straight up into the air like a goddess, hovering ten feet above the pool. Her eyes burn. Her skin is corpselike. She's drenched from head to toe in the prickly ooze."
chip," She can fly? NEEDY She's just hovering, CHIP. It's not that impressive. Jennifer speaks in a metallic, demonic-sounding voice."
jennifer,"God, do you have to undermine everything I do? You're such a player-hater."
needy,You know what? You were never a good friend. Ever. Even when we were little. You used to steal my toys and pour lemonade on my bed and make me be Ugly Ashley when we played Barbies! JENNIFER And now I'm eating your boyfriend! See? At least I'm consistent. NEEDY Why do you need him? Huh? She begins to weep.
103.,CONTINUED:  The cutest guy in school. The mailman. A teacher. You could probably even have a huge star like Chad Michael Murray. So why Chip? Why him? Is it just to piss me off? Or is it because you're insecure?
needy,"You were skinny then, too! A look of ABJECT HORROR on Jennifer's face. She reels back against the chain link fence, her eyes blazing. JENNIFER I'm gonna eat your soul and shit it out, Lesnicki. Her voice is now an unearthly growl. In the background, Chip is slowly, painfully pulling a POOL SKIMMER with an eight-foot handle off the pool deck."
needy," I thought you only murdered boys. JENNIFER I go both ways. She HURTLES herself toward Needy, roaring, her eyes white- hot, her jaws agape. She's monstrous. Chip suddenly stumbles in front of Needy and holds the HANDLE of the POOL SKIMMER in front of them like a spear. As Jennifer flies forward at demonic speed, she IMPALES HER ENTIRE TORSO on the handle. Needy screams. There's a beat of deafening silence."
104.,CONTINUED: 
jennifer,Got a tampon? Needy shakes her head mutely. JENNIFER  Thought I'd ask. You seemed like you might be pluggin'.

chip,"Oh no, I'm out of minutes!"
needy,I think 911 is always a free call. CHIP Oh yeah. You're right.
106.,CONTINUED: 
needy,I love you. CHIP Yeah me too. And you look hot in that dress.
needy,"You're clearly delirious. CHIP No. When you're dying, you can see everything a lot clearer. You can see what's true and what's not. The things that are true have this glowing halo of light around them, like a picture of the Baby Jesus, or Barbara Walters when they use the special lens. And I know for sure that you're totally hot."
needy,"I'm never leaving. CHIP But I have to go. NEEDY No! Chip's eyes close. His face relaxes. He's gone. Needy wails at the top of her lungs. She rests her head against his mutilated chest, oblivious to the blood and bone."

needy,Did you know the original Goths were a Germanic tribe that settled in Rome? They didn't wear black. They wore regular linen tunics. I don't know why nobody else knows that.
nikolai, We gotta get out of here. DIRK Why? NIKOLAI I think this girl's flipping out.
dirk,What could she do to us?
nikolai,"Look at her. Dirk takes one look at Needy's face and takes off his guitar. Nikolai motions for the rest of the band to leave the stage. The music stops abruptly. The kids in the gym murmur and complain, confused. "

needy," ""...We'll meet again."" A small creek emptying into a stream   runs parallel to the road. Needy seems something glinting   at the mouth of the creek and stoops to pick it up. It's   Nikolai's BOWIE KNIFE, the one he threw into Devil's   Kettle, never to be seen again. Needy picks it up and tucks it into her waistband. A STATION WAGON comes rattling up the road. Needy sticks her thumb out again. The wagon pulls over to the side of the road. The driver, a grizzled older man, rolls down the window. He eyes Needy lasciviously."
old man,"Where you looking to go, young lady? NEEDY East, toward Madison. OLD MAN East, huh? Guess I'm headed that way. But I'm gonna need you to pay me in ass, gas or grass. Got that? No free rides in this wagon. NEEDY I don't have any money or drugs, so you'll have to settle for ass."
old man,Fair enough. Hop in my chariot. Needy gratefully hurries into the driver's seat. OLD MAN  So why you headed East? NEEDY I'm following this rock band. OLD MAN Huh. Must be a hell of a group. NEEDY Tonight's gonna be their last show.
