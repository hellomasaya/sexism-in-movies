Speaker,Dialogue
aragon,A year younger than I was for my first.
tristan,When can I have a stag?
aragon,a stag?
tristan,Oh come on!
tristan,Why would they join up against the Irish?
aragon,Because someone has to stand up to them.
tristan,You?
aragon,"Me, Marke, all the tribes. We cant resist alone."
tristan,I could.
aragon,Oh my little warrior. We have to be careful.
aragon,Come home without something for your Lady there will be hell to pay.
tristan,Can I?
man,"The Angles have arrives my Lord, as well as the Carrods, our fellow Jutes and the Saxons."
aragon,"Good. With Marke, all will be here."
man,Yeah. It is a great day.
aragon,Let us hope so.
tristan,Thanks.  [The boy starts to make a bracelet out of the herbs. Going up to Lady Marke he hands her the finished wreath]
lady marke,We heard the news...
tristan,"Mother, I made this for you"
aragon,"Friends, look at us."
aragon,"The tribes of Britain. Divided. Weak. Just as the Irish like us. But if we were one land united, we would out number them two to one. We could defeat them once and for all. That is why we are here today, to sign this treaty of unification."
lord,But who would be King?
aragon,The strongest among us: Lord Marke.
aragon,"Look if you are happy sending all of your gold to Ireland, living as slaves then by all means do nothing."
baron,If we were happy doing that then we would never have risked coming here.
marke,"Friends. My wife is with child, my heart tells me it is a boy. I want him to grow old in a land where all of us, all the tribes: Pict, Celt, Angle, Jute, Saxon are at peace. This island has not known unity since the Romans left. That is why I sign this treaty."
wictred,And why should we follow you?
marke,"Perhaps, Wictred, because your last attempt to form an alliance without the knowledge of half the Barons in this room has failed."
man,My Lord! The Irish are here!
aragon,Take all your men. Guard the women!
marke,But you...
aragon,Go!!!
lady marke,Tristan! Hurry! Come this way.
baron,How did they know?
lady marke,"Tristan!  [Aragon manages to hold his son back and puts him in a hold under the floorboards. Aragon is then killed by Morholt. There is more destruction and fire breaks out. Tristan reaches up to touch the floorboards above and finds his fathers seeping blood on his hands. Tristan comes out of the hole and surveys the destruction. His father and Lady Marke are dead. Suddenly he is attacked by an Irishman but Marke jumps in to save him, losing his hand in the process]"
bragnae,"Shes with the Gods now Isolde, youll see her again someday."
isolde,Will I?
henchman,Morholt returns.
king donnchadh,What news of the treaty?
king donnchadh,"Good Morholt, good"
bragnae,Your mother loved you so much Isolde
isolde,Why did she die Bragnae? Why?
bragnae,It was an ill fever that took her. Fever.
isolde,No. It was her heart.
marke,Your husband?
marke,Oh sister I am so sorry.
marke,A whole generation of men.
edyth,Whos this?
marke,Tristan. Son of Aragon. Were his family now.
edyth,"I have a son about your age. Melot! Melot!  Melot, this is Tristan."
henchman,"What shall we do, my Lord?"
marke,Rebuild.
marke,Dont hold back  [Marke loses the fight easily. A boy starts yelling to the other boys]
boy,Tristan wont fight me! Look hes scared!
marke,Still won't fight?
general,Tristan has the heart of a lion.He just needs some time.
melot,"Why did you take off your helmet? You going to cry? My father died too, but you dont see me crying!"
edyth,Melot!
melot,Run! Find another trapdoor to hide under. Coward!
henchman,Tristan!
sammy,"Tristan! Tristan! Weve found something! Come on, this way."
melot,You will love it.
simon,I found a trapdoor!
melot,"You found a trapdoor? Alright Simon, will you tell us all how you found it?! Look at that!"
tristan,Where does this lead?
melot,"Youll see. I like that vase, I think I'll have that. I always knew the Castle was built on Roman foundations but we didnt think anything was left!"
tristan,Must be a burial crypt or something.
melot,Here we are: the bottom of the keep.
tristan,Who else knows about this?
sammy,Nobody.
tristan,Good.
bodkin,"The savages have rebuilt the castle at Cornwall, only now its made of stone."
king donnchadh,Of Cornwalls next tribute I want slaves. Young ones. Their future. If Marke resists have Morholt crush him.
morholt,My King.
king donnchadh,Morholt.
morholt,I have led your armies to victory far and near. Iv made you rich and powerful.
king donnchadh,Yes you have. You have been most loyal.
morholt,"When I return from Cornwall, I was hoping..."
king donnchadh,What would please you?
morholt,A wife.
bragnae,Its dark in an hour.
isolde,What do you think is really out there?
bragnae,Britannia. The old Roman lands. Full of evil and grief.
isolde,I want to see it. Do you know what the future looks like Bragnae?
bragnae,I see the life you were meant for. Your father will speak with you.
isolde,Am I just a chattel to be traded at your pleasure? Do I have no say in my own life?
king donnchadh,You have a duty to your King.
isolde,You are my father.
king donnchadh,"Then obey me, daughter."
morholt,Your father has given you the news?
morholt,And you welcome it?
isolde,I accept it.
morholt,"You know, we are more alike than you might guess."
isolde,How so?
morholt,I too dabble in elixirs.  Poison from the livers of a puffer fish. Just a taste paralyses all the senses. So if the blade doesnt kill...
isolde,Rendered safe by thistle and bark.
morholt,And you know the antidote for this?
isolde,Yohimbine.
morholt,"Makes a hard man even harder.  The only cure... wild abandon. Till out wedding day. Im to Cornwall, to deal with rabbles."
bodkin,Release them.  [The Irish men spread out and start collecting Cornish men and women as hostages]
cornish man,Leave her!
bodkin,Take him there. Get a rope. Any man foolish enough to interfere in any way shall suffer the same fate.
girl,No! No! Please No!
bodkin,If there are any more attacks we shall put our guests to death and raise this entire land. Take the horses.
marke,When would you strike?
tristan,At once. Throw everything we have at them.
marke,They are hoping you'll do that. On horse they outnumber us two to one. You would lead the men straight to their deaths.
tristan,So we do nothing?!
marke,"Donnchadh would like that even more. Me to lose face in front of the other tribes. No, we must act. We must be decisive but we cannot act alone."
marke,So. Have the good men of York come to fight with us? Hm? The Saxons of Wessex?
wictred,My men dont want to follow a Pict into battle. Let alone one leading a pack of Angles and Celts.
marke,Then why are you here?
wictred,I thought Tristan should let me command his men.
tristan,I make it my habit to follow no one.
wictred,Except Marke.
tristan,Marke delivered me from that place when I was a boy. You ran. So you can understand that when I think of Kings I think of him. When I think of cowards...
marke,They are one day from their boats on the old Roman road. Now who will ride out with Tristan to fight them?
lord,"What is your plan, Tristan?"
tristan,We will need our two fastest runners.
irish man,"Go around!  [They continue to pursue the runners on foot. Suddenly Tristan and his men spring up from hidden holes under the loam and shoot the Irish with their bows. The Irish are attacked from all sides and defeated. Back at the main part of the Irish convoy, Morholt cleans his blade]"
bodkin,"Morholt, theyre back!  [Cloaked figures ride in while the camp cheers. Suddenly they attack and more British spring from the ground. A battle ensues. Morholt begins to kill the hostages, but Tristan springs to stop him. Sammy is stabbed. Tristan is stabbed by Morholts poisoned blade but manages to kill Morholt. Melot and Tristan run to Sammys side]"
morholt,Kill the slaves!
tristan,Simon!
sammy,I dont want to die.
man,Tristan!
tristan,I cant feel my legs or my hands.
man,Poison.
tristan,Build a second boat.
man,Tristan!
melot,He shall have a King's service.
melot,"Farewell, Tristan of Aragon. Death of the Irish."
melot,When the Irish came to Cornwall and my father surrendered. You spared a dozen out of a hundred. I am even less kind. The leader and 3 shall take this message home. As for the rest...
melot,Victory.
marke,Tristan?
melot,Simon too.
marke,Did I love him like a son or did I misuse him for my own purposes?
edyth,He knew. He knew.
bragnae,Where are we going?
isolde,Away.
bragnae,You're afflicted child. Speak to me! Your father will find us and have my head. You are my charge. Please!
isolde,I am no ones charge!
bragnae,You are. And you will be Morholts Lady!
isolde,And live a loveless life like my mam?
bragnae,Whats that?
isolde,Where?
bragnae,Isolde. Wait! Dont!  Isolde. Dont! Isolde!
isolde,Its a man.
bragnae,Dead?
isolde,Alive! Bragnae help me!
bragnae,Isolde?
isolde,Help me!
isolde,Start a fire! Quickly!
isolde,His heart falters.
bragnae,What are you doing?
isolde,He needs heat. Now! Get your clothes off! Quickly!
isolde,Hurry! Quickly! Smell that? Smell the poison? When he warms we will need thistle and bark.
bragnae,Ive not been naked with a man for 15 years!
isolde,Hello.  You've been sleeping a long time. You're in Ireland. Did you know that? Shh... It's alright. You're safe here. No one knows. Don't be scared. Just sleep... sleep.
bragnae,Nooo Nooo Noo!
isolde,"Its alright, you dont need that! I forgot to tell him about you..."
bragnae,Ill wait outside with the other beasts.
tristan,You said no one else knew.
isolde,Sorry... Shes... My maid. Sworn to silence. Um... lie down please. Please?
isolde,"Its good you are remembering things. This might sting. Do you remember anything else? The boat I found you in? How you got this? Too many questions. Here keep it dry. Here I found bread, you have water and fire. The ocean is outside if you wish a bath. You wont know where you are going so please dont try to leave. Just trust me."
tristan,Why are you doing this?
isolde,Ill be back
bragnae,"This is a dangerous game you are playing. Hes English, Isolde."
isolde,Then weve got him prisoner.
bragnae,"Under no circumstances tell him your name, you hear me? Not if you wish him to escape this place. Do you hear me?"
king donnchadh,Youve been away.
isolde,I had noticed. Yes I have a bit.
king donnchadh,Where?
isolde,Bragnae and I were spying the convent of Brittes ].
king donnchadh,Seeking sanctuary?
isolde,Some women need it.
king donnchadh,"Youll find no refuge in a new religion. Your place is here, with Morholt."
isolde,Any word of my betrothed?
king donnchadh,Overdue. But comforted no doubt that you yearn for him.
tristan,What's your name?
isolde,"Oh, I think it's better if we don't bother with names."
tristan,How can I thank you if I don't have your name?
isolde,"You just did. If you insist... my name is Bragnae. I'm a lady in waiting at the court. My parents are dead. My mother, she is the source of the kindness you find so puzzling. My father would've left you where you fell."
tristan,Tristan of Aragon.
isolde,"Well Tristan of Aragon, I'd guess about you too, but I think I've already seen everything."
bragnae,"Sir! I hope you appreciate the risks we are taking, and will honour us by leaving as soon as you are able."
tristan,"She likes me. Shes right though, you do risk."
isolde,There. What of your parents?
tristan,They also died when I was a child.
isolde,Of what?
tristan,A different type of Irish kindness.
isolde,Sorry.  [Bragnae returns and interrupts their moment of tenderness]
isolde,Tomorrow then?
tristan,Tomorrow.
isolde,There she who bore you brought you forth.
tristan,Ridiculous.
isolde,I happen to believe what that says. Dont you think there is more to life?
tristan,Than what?
isolde,"Something more than duty and death! Why are we capable of feelings if not to have them? Why long for things if they are not meant to be ours? Well dont listen to me. Youre so sure of things. Youre certainty, its like armour. I wish I had that."
tristan,Why would you need it?
isolde,The joy of being a lady? Wanting something I cant have. A life of my own.
bragnae,Time for sleep now.
isolde,Ill follow you later.
bragnae,You need to rest. In case your betrothed should want to see you.
tristan,Youre promised?
isolde,Yes.
tristan,Whats he like?
isolde,Dark. Tall. Nearly twice your size. An absolute gentleman.
tristan,I thought... earlier when you spoke of wanting something you cant have.
isolde,I didnt know what I was talking about.
isolde,"Outside, just past that bluff there is a boat. Thats how you should go when you leave. You should go soon."
tristan,How do you feel?
isolde,I dont know
isolde,Tristan! Theyve found your boat. At this very moment the King himself is scouring the coast. He will find you. He finds everyone. The tide is coming lets go!
tristan,Come with me. Come with me!
isolde,I cant
tristan,Why not? Please!
isolde,"Tristan, weve both known this cant be. Weve known this from the start. That doesnt mean it isnt true. It is. It just cannot be. I want to know that you are alive somewhere thinking of me from time to time. I want to know that there is more to this life and I cant know that if they kill you. Please?"
isolde,Go!
king donnchadh,"A Cornish warrior may be ashore. Beware. We seek him as I speak. Hopefully it is just his rotted corpse we'll find, for he has slain your betrothed. Morholt is dead. Fallen in battle. Isolde? Bragnae, comfort her."
bodkin,Shes stunned.
king donnchadh,As am I by her grief.
bodkin,We should assulat the British straight away. Crush them with maximum force.
king donnchadh,"Maximum force. Like that of Markes tribe with the maximum force you speak of? I will not confront them again until our numbers are refreshed. Until then, well have cunning divide them."
bodkin,Of what nature?
king donnchadh,"A prize, perhaps."
melot,Whats this about a tournament?
marke,Donnchadh. He has offered his daughter and the lands of Lyonesse as dowry to whichever English tribe wins. It is a clever way of setting us against each other.
melot,"Well, the other barons will see through that."
wictred,As baron of Wessex it is my duty to fight in this tournament for my people.
marke,For yourself you mean.
melot,And what of the support you promised Tristan?
wictred,Tristan is dead. My people have suffered enough. They see the wealth of Lyonesse as more real than any alliance. My mind is set.
baron,And ours as well.
marke,So be it.
melot,"You're weary, let me rally your friends. Ill lead them against D..."
marke,"Ah, Melot, Melot, Melot. You are my blood and you are a noble presence but......"
guard,Lord Marke! Hes back! Its Tristan!
man,It cannot be!
edyth,Tristan!
melot,I saw you dead.
tristan,I am delivered.
marke,How? How?
marke,A toast! Tristan! Back from the dead.
man,Tristan. The Irish King offers his daughter in tournament to divide the tribes. For the power and the wealth half the tribes have sent champions to fight at the...  Tristan!
man,God knows what happened to him.
isolde,"""My face in thine eyes, thine in mine appears,"
marke,What?
tristan,It is the only way to keep the alliance alive.
marke,I fail to see how fighting with our partners keeps us allies.
tristan,"Well they are all going to the tournament anyway. By announcing you will share the dowry with every Baron that remains loyal and in turn offering to support whomever prevails, the others would be compelled to follow you when you win."
marke,If we win. If we lose we could end up following Wictred. Id need an infallible champion!
tristan,Me.
marke,You are not yet healed.
tristan,Then this trip will be my tonic. I will be ready. I know I will.
marke,What is the source of this fervour?
tristan,"Let me go and win you a wife. She can make peace without spilling one drop of blood, and maybe heal a wound from which you still lack."
bodkin,Truce. You have safe passage.
tristan,How do I look?
henchman,How do you look?
melot,Where is this Princess? Whats her name? Isolde? I want to see what she looks like.
bragnae,There. Almost done.
isolde,"No, not quite. If I am to be a present I should be fully wrapped."
king donnchadh,See how the bees come to the honey.
tristan,Tristan of Aragon.
king donnchadh,So he lives.
bodkin,For the moment.
wictred,Wictred of Glastonbury.
wictred,I fight with no champion in my stead. Know that.
bodkin,Why Wictred?
king donnchadh,Because the Barons will never unite behind him.
melot,Do you think shes got the pox?
herald,Since the dawn of time...
herald,... Begin!
wictreds opponent,Make it for real!
wictred,What?
wictreds opponent,I yield!
man,You were great!
king donnchadh,Allow it!
melot,It was too easy for you Tristan. Not much for a third draw.
wictred,Mace.
melot,One more fight Tristan. Take deep breaths.
herald,Wictred: Lord of Saxonberg. Tristan: Champion of Cornwall. Warriors: Begin!
tristan,Yield!
king donnchadh,An impressive victory. Of course the man who defeats Morholt might be expected to triumph here.
tristan,"On behalf of Cornwall, I offer your daughter a place on our throne. The throne of England, united behind one leader."
king donnchadh,Isolde! Perhaps it is just that he who took a husband provides one.
isolde,Im yours.
king donnchadh,No. Tristan of Aragon has won you on behalf of Lord Marke of Cornwall.
melot,Lets go.
king donnchadh,"Let them take her across the sea. After the wedding I'll disavow Isolde, the alliance will crumble."
henchman,Tristan. Princess wants to speak to you.
isolde,You risked your life to give me to another man.
tristan,You said your name was Bragnae. Why did you do that?
isolde,Oh what have I done? Stop this thing. Say something.
tristan,I can't. I won you in my King's name.
isolde,But I am yours. You touched me and I yielded...
tristan,It doesn't matter.
isolde,"It is the only thing that matters Tristan. Leave with me, I will go anywhere."
tristan,Your marriage will end a hundred years of bloodshed.
isolde,My marriage to another man!
tristan,Isolde. You will live with this. We must.
isolde,Don't do this to me.
melot,"Tristan, weve made shore."
marke,What if shes a hag? Or maybe she wont have me!
edyth,She will brother. Youre the prize.
isolde,My Lord.
marke,Isolde? Welcome.
isolde,If things were different. If we lived in a place without duty... would you be with me?
tristan,That place does not exist.
isolde,I'll pretend it's you.
marke,"Youre trembling. You are far from home and I am a stranger still. But you mustnt fear me. My wish is to make you happy, as a wife.. as a women and hopefully one day, the fact that I am not whole will not offend you."
marke,Thats pretty. Did you make it?
isolde,It was a present.
man,Tristan?
tristan,Might I stay here a while?
man,Of course.
edyth,Tristan!
marke,Ive never seen him like this before.
isolde,Perhaps someone his own age should speak with him.
isolde,They believe you are distant. They are worried about you. So am I.
tristan,"I can tell. Laughing at the market, holding hands, a caress on the neck when he pours you wine."
isolde,He is my husband. I remember his Kingdom comes before my life.
tristan,"Yes well, I must confess I thought you might find more difficulties in performing your duty."
isolde,Am I not permitted a single moment without mourning? Living with this Tristan as you said we must.
tristan,"I live in torture thinking of these moments. With every look he gives you I get sicker and sicker. There is a burning in me, I feel on fire and guilt and I can't get rid of either. Does it make you happy to know that?"
isolde,The Roman Bridge. I can get to it without being seen. And I will go there anytime to be there with you.
marke,"Welcome bands of Anglia, Rothgar and Orick. Wessex: Kaye and Wictred."
wictred,"As you will be King and his daughter Queen, does that mean Donnchadh will be coming to the coronation."
marke,"It does. On the next full moon, all will attend."
wictred,A lot can happen in a month
marke,"Bearing that in mind, and given the instabilities of our new land I shall be naming a second. My sister has raised one, capable of guiding you if the need should arise. He is a man of passion, fierce in battle who has learnt to tame his heart with his head. I give you Tristan of Aragon."
marke,"For the first time since the Romans, this country stands united."
tristan,"I cant be your second. Melot must be. He is blood. Besides, I wish to journey north."
marke,"You no longer sleep at Dor, and now you dont want to be my second. Do you find no comfort in your home? These stone walls that you helped build?"
tristan,I find these walls a prison.
marke,Why?
tristan,Everything I want seems misplaced.
marke,"Ever since you were a boy you sacrificed everything for me. All for one dream. Now that you reached that dream, it is natural that you would feel some loss. It doesnt matter if you want to be second. You are. I will only be king if you are my second. Id put it more gently if I could."
tristan,Then I am your second.
marke,Perhaps it is time that you took a wife!
tristan,No!
marke,Cant live alone forever.
tristan,I can!
marke,Isolde. I was trying to explain to Tristan the importance of loving. It seems he might live without it.
isolde,Why?
tristan,There are other things to live for. Duty. Honour.
isolde,But they are not life Tristan. They are the shells of life. And empty ones and in the end all they hold is days and days without love. Love is made by God. Ignore it and you can suffer as you cannot imagine.
tristan,Then I will no longer live without it.
marke,"Good. Very good! Come, we will be late!"
isolde,Late?
marke,The warriors ride out on the full moon. It is an old ritual. I shall miss you tonight.
isolde,How many did you love before me?
tristan,None.
isolde,And after me?
tristan,None.
man,Lord Marke! Are you hurt?
marke,Nothing but for my pride.
melot,"Tristan, I need to speak with you."
tristan,Go ahead.
melot,We havent even had a coronation yet to mark tradition. But now he breaks tradition and scares all the barons by naming you as second.
tristan,I tried to convince him you would be better.
melot,"Yes well, peace can be just as treacherous as war and I feel that Marke doesnt really...Listen to me!!! Our attention must be on Cornwall now more than ever."
tristan,I am sorry he didnt choose you. I am.
melot,Can I speak to you?
isolde,What do you think became of them?
tristan,They were lives... just lived.
isolde,"I find myself imaging things in this place. I decorate it. Books, a harp there... a child."
tristan,Would it be his or mine?
isolde,"I would have no way to tell, would I? He is a kind man Tristan, I cannot hate him. Yesterday at the market I saw a couple holding hands, and I realised we would never do that. Never anything like it. No picnics or unguarded smiles. No rings. Just stolen moments that leave too quickly."
marke,Where is Isolde?
bragnae,"I dont know for sure, she was having a walk in the garden before and Im afraid I got tired so I returned. Its my fault."
bragnae,"Youre going to get caught! Both of you! Hes looking for you right now, hell see you! I told you this would happen!"
tristan,"There is another door here, forgotten. This comes up in the bottom chamber of the keep."
isolde,I hate this.
tristan,Hurry! Go on.
bragnae,Im tired of this. Im tired of lying for you. Im sick of it.
isolde,Then dont.
isolde,"There is a servings child, quite ill. Doing better now."
marke,I didnt ask you were you were. Your heart is beating so fast.
isolde,Is it?
marke,Isolde. Is there anything I can do to make you happier. I want to make you happy.
isolde,Im fine.
wictred,Shes in love with Tristan. Theyre intimates. If I expose them it will break Markes heart and his hold on the other Barons.
king donnchadh,How?
wictred,"With Markes champion in chains, well take Castle Dor. You can man your armies unopposed. There will be no one defending you in the waters."
king donnchadh,And your price?
wictred,I want Markes throne.
king donnchadh,"When his throne falls apart, well go over and pick up the pieces."
marke,Tristan? Can I speak with you? Is it possible... do you think a man blinded by love... Is it possible that that man might not see treachery right in front of him?
tristan,No.
marke,"Perhaps you could follow her. I cant ask anyone else. I know. I know what you think  Im acting like a child. Normally I can read faces, but with hers I feel like... I can't be objective. Shes so delicate."
tristan,You really love her.
marke,"Oh... I do...terribly. I didnt know how empty I was. She sustains me, she thrills me. And when I see this ring, it is a ring of thorns."
tristan,The ring is nothing. She's loyal to you. I am sure of it.
marke,... If you say so.
man,I count nine
tristan,If they move they will warn us with a black flag
marke,You bring an entourage?
king donnchadh,"I can let myself be alone in my position Lord Marke. But dont worry, they will stay offshore.  I miss you."
marke,"My nephew, Merlot of Cornwall"
king donnchadh,"And Tristan, slayer of my best general, winner of Isolde, defender of the alliance. You are a fortunate man."
marke,Indeed.
marke,Tristan! Seems I worried for nothing.
wictred,"May I dance with the Queen, or does Tristan have the next one?"
marke,"Thats right, you have never danced with Isolde before!"
wictred,A new song for Tristan. Slow.
isolde,Why did you burn it?
tristan,You know.
isolde,Meet me there in an hour or Ill die.
marke,"I could still teach you a thing or two, dancing being one of them."
kaye,Accuse him now.
wictred,"No, no, no. Well have more than accusations."
marke,Is something the matter?
isolde,Im just feeling a little weary thats all. I might just go and have a lie down.
marke,Of course.
wictred,"Friends, friends hear me! Weve forgotten the full moon isnt it time to ride out?"
general,No. Tonight it cause for exception.
wictred,"But the coronation should uphold tradition, surely it is not to be neglected already?"
marke,We honour it. In half a night. Ride out! Wheres Tristan?
isolde,I miss Ireland
tristan,"Isolde, this must end."
isolde,Thats like asking me to stop breathing.
tristan,It cannot be.  [Elsewhere Wictred leads the hunt to where Tristan and Isolde are]
isolde,Please dont leave me. Please!
marke,Isolde? There is someone...  No.
king donnchadh,"I see how it is in Cornwall. My money is good enough, my alliance is good enough, but my daughter you pass amoung your lieutenants like a whore!"
isolde,Its not like that.
king donnchadh,I see no relation to me here! I will see this peace end.
wictred,You have brought the allegiance to shame. Who would fight for this?
marke,Seize him. Seize him.
melot,Behold your hero uncle  I would have no heroes now.
bodkin,Theyre ashore.
king donnchadh,Prove your worth.
baron,"If a man cant rule his woman, how can he govern an entire Kingdom?"
melot,He cant.
lord,We have suffered peace.
baron,Its all been coming apart. I can feel it
lord,Youre right.
wictred,"There is very little time. Fortunately, Donnchadh has no quarrel with anybody here. Hes asked me to give you a message."
baron,Whats this?
wictred,"It is compensation for the men you will lose attacking Castle Dor with Donnchadh tomorrow. Lets be honest, our people need a stronger leader."
baron,"And who might that be, Wictred?"
wictred,Melot. Too long the ablest amoung us has been denied his rightful place. I pledge you my legiance and offer him my services as his second.
melot,I like this plan.
marke,"I came to apologise. Ive been selfish arrogantly thinking that perhaps Id given enough. At least enough to merit if not your love then at least your respect. You have a home. A kingdom. Why was it not enough? Tell me.  Tell me! You do not know what you have done! Everything is destroyed, everything! All because you did not have enough. Shes loyal to you I am sure of it. You bloodsucker. What could it had been had I not stretched out my hand to save your life. How I curse that day, how I curse it. And so be with your defence. Then I will go complete your punishment, Donnchadh marches on us as we speak."
bragnae,Shes young. I will not let you harm her!
marke,How long?
isolde,"Since you thought he was dead. I found him wounded on the beach in Ireland. I hid him from my father and I told him my name was Bragnae. So when he came to the tournament at Dunluce to win Donnchadhs daughter he didnt realise it was me. All this time my heart has been his, and I am sorry. He tried harder than you can possibly imagine because he loves you."
melot,"I will coax him out, make sure Donnchadh knows this."
wictred,"Of course, of course. You know as things moved along I suspected them for some time."
merlot,Tristan and Isolde?
wictred,You know what I could never work out? How it was conducted. How she got in and out of Dor unseen.
merlot,The tunnel.
wictred,What?
merlot,The Roman Tunnel!
wictred,Show me.
tristan,What is this?
henchman,The will of the King. Farwell.
isolde,I told him about Ireland. Hes given us our freedom. Why does loving you feel so wrong?
tristan,Get in.
isolde,"Tristan, if I do this."
tristan,"For all time, they will say it was our love that brought down a kingdom. Remember us."
isolde,"Tristan, dont! Tristan! Tristan! Tristan! Why?! Tristan!"
marke,Get the livestock and fuel undercover. Put some archers on the ramparts.
general,All the archers have deserted us as has half the household.
marke,And you stay?
man,If you are surprised then they have won already.
general,"Come on, hurry!"
king donnchadh,Burn it. Their will is as strong as milk. The seas will unravel us. Where is Wictred with his key?
melot,It comes up to the Roman foundations at the lowest level.
wictred,This is a godsend!  [They both enter it and Wictred gestures for his men to follow]
wictred,What will you say to him?
melot,That he will not make any more mistakes and that it is time for him to move ba  whats that?!
man,Aim for the front of the line
marke,They are waiting.
man,The Irish are inside!
marke,Follow me!
wictred,Bar the door make sure no one gets in!
melot,You.
tristan,What happened here?
melot,A reward for idiocy. A dozen Irish have blazed your way.
tristan,"Melot, I came to aid Marke."
melot,Everyone lies.
tristan,I didnt lead them here.
melot,"No, I did."
tristan,Why?
melot,I thought someone believed in me.
tristan,It will be undone.
melot,TristanIm for the wormsswear to me that you are true.
tristan,As we were brothers.
melot,Build my boat.
wictreds man,Theyre here!
wictred,Keep them back.
markes man,Wictred.
marke,Hes trying to lower the bridge
markes man,Traitor!
marke,"Give me your shield, were pinned down!"
marke,Tristan!
markes man,Him too?
marke,"No, hes with us!"
marke,Tristan!  [Tristan stabs Wictred and kills him. Tristan pulls the sword from his body as the battle subsides]
marke,Tristan! How did you get here?
tristan,"Secret. Secrets, in the bowls of the keep."
marke,In the bowls of the keep.
man,They have reached the palisades.
general,Then we must keep hope.
king donnchadh,Get back! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!  [Tristan slowly steps out with the head of Wictred in his hands]
tristan,Behold! The head of a traitor!
marke,"Will you always be little men, who cannot see what was and could be again? There is no middle ground! So slay us  or slay him!"
king donnchadh,"Oblidge them.  Oblidge them!  [He attacks people around him, but is shot in the back by an arrow. Suddenly the Irish and the British start to fight. Tristan falls to the ground and Marke runs to his side]"
tristan,Take me out of here. Take me to the river.
general,Hurry!
marke,Bring her.
general,"Marke, you must come, the battle needs you. Well lose everything."
marke,"I must heed their call, I am the King."
general,Weve driven them back as far as we can but they are holding us at the throat.
general,Goodbye my friend.  [Marke and his generals leave and Isolde goes to Tristans side]
isolde,"Know that I love you Tristan. And wherever you go, whatever you see, I will always be with you."
tristan,"You were right. I do not know if life is greater than death, but love was more than either."
isolde,"""My face in thine eyes, thine in mine appears,"
