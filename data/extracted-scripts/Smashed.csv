Speaker,Dialogue
over black:," CLINKING GLASSES and other assorted BAR SOUNDS.  KARAOKE ANNOUNCER  Yeah, Kate!"
charlie,"That was so good, baby!"
kate,Bullshit.
charlie,I'm serious. You sing like an angel -- a drunk angel.
kate,"If you were writing about my performance for your blog, what would you say?"
charlie,"I'd say that, uh...my wife is the sexiest, most amazing woman alive."
kate,That would be such a shitty article -- nobody would read it.
owen,"Yeah -- I've been trying to flirt with the bartender, but...I can't tell."
kate,She's hot! What can't you tell?
owen,She looks like she could kick my ass. No way would she go for a guy like me.
kate,You're being a little girl -- just go talk to her.
owen, I don't know...forget about it.
kate, I'll take point -- follow me.
female bartender,`Kay.
kate,Wait -- don't you wanna know what happened to him?
female bartender, What happened?
kate,"He just got back from England -- because he went there for a girl! A preppy, bitchy girl. Diane Court...that was her name. He loved her so much that he went with her because she had a fellowship or something. He gave up being a kickboxer. A kickboxer!                               *  And she dumped him."
female bartender, You kickbox?
owen, Yeah.
kate," And he teaches kids at the kickboxing studio. Oh, they're so cute!"
owen, ...I could be their parent.
kate, I think I got him laid.
charlie,Yeah?
kate,She seems totally game.
charlie,Sure she just didn't want to get into your pants?
kate,I think I'm done for the night.
charlie,Yeah?
owen,"She's seen ""Say Anything."""
charlie,"Eh, well...what're you gonna do, huh?  Wanna drive us home?"
kate,No -- he needs to keep working it!         * You guys stay here.
charlie,I don't want to watch my brother not score. I want to go to bed with you and...  ...you know.
kate,"I'll be home when you get there. We can ""you know"" then."
owen," Yeah, man -- you don't have a job to wake up for in the morning or anything."
charlie,"Writing is a job! Not having to report to an office only makes work harder.  Baby, you drank a lot. I think Owen should take us home -- you're too drunk to drive."
kate,"So's Owen.  I'm not that drunk. Besides, you know I focus when I drive -- it sobers me up."
charlie,Tell that to the cops.
kate," I love you, baby. I'll be waiting for you in a nice warm bed. You have exactly one mission: get your brother laid -- and don't talk to any other women."
charlie,That sounds like two missions.
kate,"No, it's just one."
charlie," It kinda sounded like two, right?"
owen, It did.
kate, GoodbyeIloveyouboth!
kate,You okay?
freda, Yeah. Are you?
kate, Um...sure.
freda,"Good.  Hey, I'm not really okay."
kate,Oh...
freda,My bitch sister just took off and left me here so she could hook up with some asshole. Now what am I supposed to do? Huh? I don't have a car here.
kate,I guess I could...
freda,You'll give me a ride? Oh my god! Thank you!
kate,"I was gonna say ""call you a cab,"" `cause, you know -- I don't even know you."
freda,It's not far. Please? Pretty please...?
freda,"You know, you shouldn't drink and drive."
kate,I wasn't --
freda,Just kidding. Can I have a sip?
kate,"It's, uh...whiskey."
freda,"Fuck yeah, it's whiskey! I love whiskey. You're the real thing, huh? A hardcore drinking bitch like me!"
kate,I don't know. No.
freda,Can I smoke in your car?
kate," Okay, fine -- go ahead. Can you just roll down the window?"
freda,Of course -- I'm not uncivilized.
kate, WHOA!
freda,Want a hit?
kate,"No, I...is that pot?"
kate,"Oh, shit! No...no thank you."
freda,C'mon -- it's good crack.
kate,"I don't, um...I've never smoked crack."
freda, Really? This stuff is the truth -- and it'll sober you up.
kate,Uh...I think you should go.
freda,I'm not getting out in the middle of nowhere. Do you know what could happen to me all alone out here at                     * night?
kate,I don't know -- people might offer you crack?
freda,Seriously? It's not a big deal -- just take a little hit.
kate,I said no.
freda,One hit won't hurt you. It'll sober you up.
kate,One puff. Then we are both going home.
freda,"You've got money, right?"
charlie, Huh?!
kate,"Shhh...it's okay, baby. Go back to sleep."
charlie,What happened? I came home and you were gone and I waited and waited.
kate,It's a long story.
charlie,I was worried. I kept calling you.
kate,I ended up...
charlie,You smell funny. What do you smell like?
kate,I fell asleep in my car. Near the bar. I was too drunk to drive.
charlie,"So, why didn't you come back or call me?"
kate,Charlie --  -- I'm fine.
charlie,"Well, maybe I'm not. I worry, baby. I love you -- and you know how you get sometimes."
kate,I love you too. But I'm home. It's over. I gotta get to work.
charlie,I can't be worried about you all the time.
kate,Don't worry so much. I'm fine.  C'mon -- let me get you to bed.
charlie,I'm up now -- how `bout I make us bacon and egg sandwiches?
charlie,Check for your mom's on the table.
kate,"Thanks, baby."
charlie,Because I make it with love -- and bacon.
kate," Now, if I add a ""C,"" what word do I have?"
kate,"That's correct! Can. You've won an all-expenses paid trip to the blackboard, Hillary!                                  *"
angela,"""Hurry up in there -- I gotta use the can!"""
kate," Wonderful, Angela. You get a Camaro with flames painted on the hood."
ramon,P.
kate,"P...okay, what word would that make if I added a ""P""?"
ramon,Um...pan?
kate,Pan! That's right. Ramon Martinez...COME ON DOWN!
kids,EW! GRODY! GROSS! YUCK! IT SMELLS LIKE CHEESE! SLOPPY JOE! GRANDPA! SHRIMP! BACON!
kate, I'm so sorry you had to see that.
kate,What?
ramon,Are you?
kate,Yes.
principal barnes,Vice Principal Davies will be looking after your students for the rest of the day -- so you don't need to worry about that.
kate,"Oh, that's really good to know. I'll have to thank him.  I just feel awful for getting sick in front of my students."
principal barnes,"Oh, please -- they're troopers. I'm sure they've seen plenty worse.  So -- how long have you been pregnant?"
kate,Um...it's the first trimester.
principal barnes,"Well, it's very exciting. You must be thrilled."
kate, Uh-huh.
principal barnes,Can I ask a...personal question?
kate,Okay.
principal barnes,How's it...  ...going for you?
kate,Huh?
principal barnes,"The pregnancy, I mean."
kate, Well...it's hard to explain.
principal barnes,Of course...
kate,"I wouldn't call it a burden, but --"
principal barnes,It's a responsibility.
kate,Yeah. Exactly.
principal barnes, Can I...touch it?
kate,"Um, I don't...okay -- but it sleeps a lot."
principal barnes,Of course.
kate,Like...a lot.
principal barnes, Hello in there. Can you hear me? You're a tiny miracle. Did you know that? A miracle.
kate, Thank you.
kate,"Yeah, well...I'm really embarrassed -- but I feel a lot better. And I just wanted to say thank you."
kate," Oh, no, I..."
kate,"I know that! Oh, God, I...  ...listen -- I'm not actually pregnant."
kate,I'm just really hung over. The kids started asking me questions after I vomited and I panicked.
kate,I know. I...please don't say anything.
kate,I had such a crappy morning.
charlie,Me too. I spent like three hours at the post office trying to buy stamps and stuff.
kate,I told my class I was pregnant.
charlie," Oh, baby, that's --"
kate,I'm not. Pregnant. So don't worry.
charlie, `Course then I'd have to drink your beer...
kate,"Well, it was a lie. I just lied to my class. After barfing in front of them."
charlie, Ooh...
kate,"Yeah, that's what they said.  Listen...I can't do this anymore."
charlie,What do you mean?
kate,I dunno. I think I might...drink too much.
charlie,Oh. That. Yeah...you kinda do.
kate,I know I do -- I'm a fucking mess...
charlie,"Baby -- that's not true. You're beautiful. And brilliant. And I love you. I wouldn't be married to a ""mess."""
kate,I left work after puking in front           * of little kids. And...now I'm               * drinking in the middle of the day.          *
charlie,"Well, those things happen sometimes.  I mean, they shouldn't happen all the time, but...it's the price of, uh, truly living life."
kate,Isn't that like a slogan for some kind of beer or toothpaste or something...?
charlie,"No. And it's true -- you and me, we're not just some boring couple in the suburbs who don't sleep with each other and have nothing to talk about except whatever TV show they're currently into.  We, like...still know how to party."
kate,Yeah...  And I might need help.
charlie,I'll help you.
kate,"I know, but...I might need more help."
charlie,Yeah? Like a therapist?
kate,"I don't know -- I just get stupid when I'm drunk, and I'm drunk a lot."
charlie,We just like to have a good time.
kate,"Yeah, well...  ...you've gotta promise not to tell this to anyone."
charlie, I promise.
kate,That includes Owen.
charlie,Of course.
kate,"Well, last night I kinda, um...  ...smoked some crack."
charlie,WHAT?!
kate,"After I left the bar, I, uh, picked up this drunk girl and...I don't really remember what came next, but I ended up smoking crack with her."
charlie, You give someone a ride and she rewards you with crack?!
kate,Well...she seemed desperate. She really needed a ride home.
charlie,Where?
kate,Downtown. I think she maybe lives in...a tent?
charlie,What?
kate,"Well...she might be homeless. Or a prostitute. Or just some lost sorority girl.  To be honest, I'm not sure..."
charlie," Oh, my god...you smoked crack with some random stranger? Did you...share a pipe?"
kate,The drinking led to the crack- smoking. The drinking leads to everything stupid I do.  I mean...can you even remember the last time we had sober sex?
charlie,We'll chill out with the booze for a while. We can just be wine-with-                   * dinner people.  How's that sound?
charlie,"Maybe you should go to, uh... one of those meetings. They have `em over there."
kate,"Yeah, right."
charlie,Remember when I was shit-faced and took that Q & A pamphlet from there?
kate," Holy shit! And we answered ""yes"" to like every question and at the end it was like, ""If you answered `yes' to any of these you're an alcoholic!"""
charlie,"Yeah...  ...that was fun, wasn't it?"
kate,What crack?
charlie,"Oh, sorry -- I thought there was a crack there...  ...but you must have smoked it last night.  Kate rolls her eyes -- and then jokingly swerves towards Charlie, trying to knock him over. He LAUGHS and speeds away. Kate chases after him."
charlie,"""Have you missed days of work or school because of drinking?"""
kate,Absolutely.
charlie,"""Do you envy people who can drink without getting into trouble?"""
kate,Envy isn't exactly the right word...
charlie,"""Do you have `blackouts'?"""
kate,"Yeah, but who doesn't?"
charlie,"""Has your drinking caused trouble at home?"""
kate,No! We're great.
charlie,"Yeah. Definitely. But we still had a lot of ""yes"" answers.  Yep...we still qualify as drunks."
kate,I'm gonna go!
charlie," Yeah, right."
kate,No -- I'm serious! I'm gonna go. What time is it?
charlie,Eight.
kate,See ya.
charlie, Uh-huh...
kate, This is me: going.
charlie,You've been boozing.
kate,So? You should come too!
charlie,"Yeah, right. You can't go to AA wasted. It's like a rule or something."
kate,"Oh, yeah? Watch me!"
donovan," Hey, I'm Donovan. Welcome."
kate,Hi Donovan -- I'm Kate!
donovan,"You must be a newcomer, huh?"
kate,A what?
donovan," Um, I'm not really allowed to talk to new chicks, but there are lots of women here who can help you out."
kate, Do I just sit wherever?
donovan,The meeting already started so just try to find a spot anywhere.
kate,To this? Yeah. Why's everyone whispering?
kate,I guess.
tattoo man,"Not to embarrass anyone, but so that we may get to know you better - - is there anybody here in their first thirty days of recovery?"
kate,I'm Kate. I...I'm...I guess I'm a little drunk right now.
tattoo man," You know, Kate, we actually ask that you don't share if you've had                  * a drink or any mind-altering substance in the past 24 hours."
kate," I can -- I kinda hate my dad and don't talk to him. And my mom...oh, man...I don't even know where to start. She's, like, stuck in the 80's and kind of a metalhead. Her last boyfriend called himself a drummer but really just gave drum lessons to little kids and --"
tattoo man, It gets better.
kate," I like drinking is the thing. I mean, I don't want to say you guys are wrong or anything..."
tattoo man,"Thank you -- we're all here to help. We do have to move on, though."
amber,"Hey, I'm Amber, alcoholic. I can't really believe that it's been five years. I mean, my life was a mess back then. Now I'm back in school, I have an amazing man, I love my parents -- it's crazy..."
kate," How old are you, Amber?"
amber, Um...okay? It's because I did the work. I got down on my knees and prayed every night! I went to a meeting everyday!
kate,Everyday?
amber,"It wasn't easy, but I've gotta say, I owe everything to AA. Well, AA -- and God, of course!"
everyone,God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change -- courage to change the things I can - - and wisdom to know the difference.
kate,AMEN!
kate,So much for that.
charlie,Was it a bunch of old biker guys?
kate,"No, it was...I don't know. Enthusiastic people. A lot of really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE!"
charlie,Yuck -- I hate enthusiasm. I'm sorry it wasn't cool.
kate,I don't have to drink.  I just really like to drink.                            *
charlie, Good -- `cause you're my favorite person to drink with in the whole damn world.
charlie,Are you trying to have some sex?
clerk,"You know I can't sell you this, Kate."
kate,What? You can't tell I'm 21? Come on -- I'm in here all the time. You know me.
clerk,"Yes, I do, Kate. And I know you're old enough -- but it's too late."
kate,C'mon -- we can just pretend it's before two...
clerk, Stop it.
kate,It's just a little wine. I'm not driving or anything.
clerk,I don't think so. Sorry.
kate,"Come on, dude -- I'll let you have a sip if you want."
clerk,It's the law. I can't sell alcohol after 2 a.m. You know that.
kate,"Why don't you give it to me, then? That wouldn't hurt anything. A gift -- because we're friends."
clerk,I could lose my job.
kate," You distract him, okay?!"
clerk,Look -- why don't you get a bottle of water or a coffee or something instead?
kate,Water or coffee? Fuck you. What -- just cause I won't suck your dick?
clerk," Oh my god. Okay, enough -- you gotta go."
kate,Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
clerk,What the fuck are you doing?!
kate," I didn't mean to! Sometimes I just have to pee really, really bad.                         *"
clerk, Get outta here NOW!
kate, C'mon...can't we drink together?
kate,Charlie!
charlie,"Come back to bed, baby."
kate,I have to go to work. You snoozed my alarm again. I'm gonna be late.
charlie,"Well, you peed on me so I guess                     * we're even.                                         *"
kate,I have a weak bladder.
charlie,Well...I can't go to work like this.
kate,You work from our kitchen.
charlie,"Yeah, but changing the sheets is my real job.  Hey -- where were you last night?"
kate,Huh?
charlie,I woke up at like 4 a.m. and you were gone.
kate,Where would I go at 4 a.m. alone? You must've been dreaming.
kate,I...
principal barnes,I can only imagine the chemistry experiment that's going on --
ramon,Are you gonna have a boy or a girl?
kate,I don't know yet.
kate,Not until summertime. You guys will be on vacation.
ramon,If you have a boy what will you name him?
kate,Maybe...Woodrow Wilson?
angela,That's a name for a man -- not a baby!
kate,Thanks again for covering for me.
kate,There won't be another time.
kate, ...David?
kate,I don't know. 
kate,I went to AA last night.
kate,It was awful. I kept getting shushed.
kate, You?
kate,Maybe that would be good...I don't know.
principal barnes, Mrs. Hannah -- I've got something for you...
kate, Thanks.
principal barnes,"I bet your mother is over the moon, huh? Probably planning you a baby shower...?"
kate,"Oh, well...she and I aren't that close."
principal barnes,"Oh, I'm sorry. Well, listen -- any motherly thing you need -- I'm                       * here, okay?"
kate,Okay.  And...you're kinda the only person at school -- besides Mr. Davies -- who knows I'm pregnant. Could you...?
principal barnes,My lips are --
kate,Hey...
charlie,Howdy.
kate,How was your day? And what's that smell?
charlie,Eh -- alright. Couldn't find oatmeal so I made ketchup soup.
kate, Charlie! You need to eat.
charlie,What? It's tasty.  So...I'm going to see that band                      * from Iceland with the triplets play                  * tonight. Want to come with me and Owen to check it out?
kate,"Oh, that sounds fun, but..."
charlie,C'mon -- Owen can't pick up girls without you.
kate,I don't know...this guy I work with -- Mr. Davies --
charlie,The Vice Principal?
kate,Yeah -- turns out he's sober and invited me to a meeting.
charlie," Wow, that's...uh, cool."
kate,What?
charlie,"Nothing -- I just...I didn't think you really loved the meeting you went to yesterday. In fact, it sounded like you hated it. So I'm kinda surprised you're going back."
kate,Well...this is a smaller meeting. It might be different. I dunno -- I think I want to give it a fair shot.
charlie,"I'm here for you, okay? Even though I drink -- I could slow down if you need me to.  I'm sure I could."
kate,"Does everybody just...kinda, you know -- talk here?"
kate,So since you're taking me here does that make you my sponsor?
kate, I can't believe I'm really here.
kate,I kinda like her.
kate,I feel like you're my wingman.
kate,"Hey, I liked your speech."
kate,Kate. This is my first meeting. Or... first meeting where I'm not wasted.
kate,I don't really know how this stuff works. 
kate,Okay. Yeah.  You've been sober since you were 24?
kate,"Okay, um...hello. I'm Kate and...  ...I'm an alcoholic?"
group,"Hi, Kate."
kate,"Sorry. I don't mean to laugh -- it's just saying those words...  I'm kinda...scared.  Kate stops. Looks around self-consciously.  CUT TO BLACK.  FADE IN: A SERIES OF short, quick scenes:"
kate,I'm Kate. I'm an alcoholic.
everyone,"Hi, Kate."
kate,"I kinda can't believe it's been ninety days.  The longest I've gone since high school without drinking was, like, a week."
kate,It's weird -- in after-school specials the getting-sober part was only like a minute of the movie and suddenly...daddy's all okay.
kate,"Everything else. Work, my non- existent relationship with my mom..."
kate," A year, at least."
kate,"Maybe.  I haven't pissed myself in awhile, though. So that's good."
kate,I could stick around and help you...
kate,I didn't know you were married.
kate,Why?
kate,"Because you're a dude we can't talk? I don't get that ""men stick with men, women stick with women"" stuff."
kate,Are you trying to tell me that you have a crush on me?
kate,"Yeah, crush."
kate,It's okay. I think you're a really good guy.
kate,"Oh, c'mon..."
kate,WHAT THE FUCK?
kate,YES.
kate,"Jesus -- you can't just go around telling people you want to fuck their ""moist pussy.""  Who even says that?"
kate,I have to go inside my house -- where I live with my husband.  Thanks for your creepy version of honesty.
kate,You okay?
charlie, Yep -- I'm just pacing myself. The tortoise wins the race.
kate,"Actually, I'm not really in the mood."
kate,It's okay -- the 90 days was the gift.
charlie,Sorry if I was doing a bad job -- I'm kinda hammered.
kate,It's alright. Charlie...  ...I miss you.
charlie,Huh?                                                *
kate,I mean...I don't know. I don't really feel connected to you anymore.
charlie,Did I do something?
kate,No.  We don't talk that much.
charlie,"We used to talk, but now you come home and go to meetings and by the time you get back I'm --"
kate,Kinda drunk.
charlie,"I was gonna say ""tired."""
kate,There's some stuff I need to do this weekend. I think I'm gonna go up to Lake Arrowhead.
charlie,Really? To see your mom?
kate, Do I need a reason?
charlie,"With your mom? Kinda.  Is this the ""amends"" step?"
kate,No.
charlie,Well then why're you going?
kate, And Jenny thinks it would be a good         * idea.
charlie,"I don't know...I mean, do you do everything your sponsor tells you to do?"
kate,No. Do you think I'm brainwashed or something?
charlie,I dunno...it's been a long damn time since you've seen your mom.  And you didn't listen when I suggested we visit her.
kate, With all the changes I'm going through.
charlie,"Well, can I come with you? It'll be like a little vacation."
kate,Um...I think I should go alone.
charlie,"Come on, if you do that you'll just get depressed. If I go we can try to make it fun. Go hiking and stuff."
kate,"Well, if you go, don't take this the wrong way but -- I'd like it if maybe you didn't drink.  Just while we're there."
charlie, I think I can handle not drinking for like a day.
charlie,Ah...the lawn-gnomes. I missed those guys.
kate, I should've brought something.
charlie,You're fine.
kate,"Something, you know? Flowers, or..."
charlie,Wine?
kate,No. Definitely not that.
kate," Oh, God..."
rochelle, Katie!
kate,"I left you a message, mom."
rochelle,"Oh, you know I don't check that thing.  Hello there, young man."
charlie,"Hi, Ms. Foster."
rochelle,"Well, then...  Just kidding. Come inside -- let me fix you both some drinks."
kate,Just water for me.
kate,"That's pretty wild, mom."
rochelle,"Right?  What's wrong, honey? Think I forgot how to mix `em?"
kate,I told you I just wanted water.
rochelle,"Oh, please! Where I'm from, ""no"" means ""yes.""  Am I right or am I right?"
charlie, Huh-huh...
kate,"That's actually why I wanted to come up, mom.  I stopped drinking."
rochelle, Are you telling me I'm going to be a grandma?
kate,"I'm not pregnant, mom."
rochelle,Oh.
kate,I just needed a break. I'm sober for the first time in years.
rochelle,Well...  ...we'll see how long that lasts.
kate,"It's been a while, actually."
charlie, 90 days.
rochelle, -- for this little mission.
charlie, Hey -- I'm not drinking either...today.
kate, And...I started going to 12-step meetings.
rochelle,Ah...yes. Assholes Anonymous.  You better be careful -- they change.
kate,"I thought you'd be happy for me, mom."
rochelle,"Oh...I'm sorry -- I'm not being a good hostess, am I?"
kate,"It's okay, mom. I know you can't help it."
kate,This place shut down a decade ago and then there was a fire and now it's basically abandoned.
charlie,Of course.
kate,I'm sorry my mom's so awful.
charlie, She just can't handle her liquor.
kate,Huh?
charlie,You know -- sneak off with a co- worker and do it against a pine tree or something?
kate,Um...no.
charlie,"I mean, if I were a teenage boy working with a stone cold fox like you I'd totally want to hook up with you here. Like...in the ginger bread house.  Charlie puts his arms around Kate.  CHARLIE  You were probably the coolest girl in town -- and the prettiest. I'm sure everyone was in love with you.  Kate giggles. They kiss. It's sweet."
teachers,SURPRISE!
principal barnes,I couldn't keep quiet. Sorry. I just had to tell everyone so we could celebrate.
kate, Oh...you shouldn't have.
principal barnes,You don't have to thank me -- just open your presents!
kate,Wow...
principal barnes,Go ahead.
other teachers,"`C'mon, Kate! You're gonna love what I got you! Is it a boy or a girl?"
kate," Oh, it's so...nice."
principal barnes, It's to hang over the crib!
kate,Uh-huh...
principal barnes,Mmmm...it's so moist.
kate, What?
kate,What you said to me was really fucked up.
kate,What were you even thinking?
kate,"I get that. But you can't force your ""honesty"" on everyone you know."
kate,"No -- you don't have to do that. I didn't even tell him. But...you can't say that to a girl -- like, ever."
kate,"Seriously. Consider that a rule of thumb.  Someday, you're gonna meet a nice, available lady -- but if you say ""moist pussy"" to her, you will never, ever, ever get to see that part of her body!"
charlie,Listen -- I'm sorry. He's drunk...really drunk.
kate,I'm not mad at him -- I'm mad at you! You said you wouldn't tell anyone about what I did.
charlie,I'm...sorry. I...was drunk too when I told him.
kate,Great.  Why don't you guys just go to the bar now?
charlie,You wanna come?
kate,I'm hanging here.
charlie,"I'm sure they have near-beer, baby. It'll be fun."
kate,I'm staying in.
charlie,That sounds like a lot of fun.
kate,Bye.
charlie,I love you.
kate,Yeah...  ...I love you too.
kate,Yes?
kate,What?
kate," Well...""Shouldn't you be fatter?"" is the correct way to ask that question."
kate,"Well, I..."
class,OOOH!
kate,"See -- I was pregnant but, it wasn't my time, I suppose..."
kate,WHAT? No -- of course not!
toby,Mrs. Hannah -- are you going to hell?
kate,"No! I didn't kill my baby! Okay, listen kids -- we shouldn't be talking about this. But...  ...sometimes women get pregnant and then early on -- before it's even a baby -- they stop being pregnant."
kate,No -- not because a doctor   murdered it.  Does anyone want to ask me   any questions?
kate,Does it matter that I lied? That I was never pregnant?
kate, And the bad news?
kate," That's all, huh?"
charlie,Well... 
kate, Jenny.                                      *
charlie,She's like a parole officer.
kate,She's my sponsor.
charlie,I'm glad to know every little fuck- up I have is gonna become a topic of conversation with some chick I don't even know.
kate," So...what'd you do today, honey?"
charlie,I finished some writing and met up with Owen to watch the game and toss a few back. Dear.  You do anything special?
kate,I lied to my class again. I told them that I had a miscarriage.
charlie,"Yeah, it is. Telling kids fucked-up stuff is totally funny...in, you know -- a kinda fucked-up way."
kate,"Great, well -- I'm glad I'm not actually having a baby."
charlie,"God, Kate -- come on. What else were you supposed to do?"
kate,"Well, I feel like a piece of shit for lying."
charlie,It's not that big a deal. Jesus. Is this what those meetings teach you? To make drama out of nothing?
kate,It's not nothing. I lied to little kids and to my boss because I can't take responsibility for my actions.
charlie,Why don't you go and tell the Principal that you were never pregnant? That the reason you puked is because you smoked crack all night? Would you feel better about yourself then?
kate,"I've been thinking about doing that, actually.  Yeah. I think I would feel better about myself."
charlie,"Fine. Do it, then. I guess you don't need a job."
kate,I could be like you -- I could stay home drinking all day and never do anything responsible.
charlie, I never do anything responsible? What about buying this house that we live in? Or the food that we're eating?
kate,Having rich parents doesn't make you responsible. I think it's pretty much done the opposite.
charlie,"Oh, I'm sorry that I have a family that supports us -- and not the other way around."
kate,What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
charlie,"Nothing, Kate. But you can't be mad at me because my family has helped us out. You should be grateful we don't have to struggle."
kate,I wouldn't care if we struggled with money. I've struggled with money my whole life.  I'd rather worry about where my next meal is coming from than if I - - in some drunken stupor -- married a man who just wants to party and meet bands.
charlie,What the fuck are you talking about?
kate,I'm talking about you being a baby. A selfish baby.
charlie,You know what?
kate,What?
charlie,I fucking hate AA! It turned you into a bitch. A brain-washed bitch.
kate,At least I'm not drunk all the time.
charlie,"Yeah, you don't drink booze for three months and suddenly you're some saint? You have it all together and I'm just a baby?"
kate,You loved that person? Do you not love me now?
charlie,"Yeah, of course. But it's different. You're different."
kate,Before I was a mess.  I'm finally getting my life together -- and you loved me more before?
charlie," Kinda, yeah."
kate,I feel so fucking weird right now -- Charlie doesn't love me like he used to and I've lied to my students multiple times. 
kate,Everything in life isn't connected to being an alcoholic.
kate,"""Steps""..."
kate,I have the crying part covered.
kate,I don't know what I'm gonna do about anything.
kate,You sure that's okay?
principal barnes,"I'm so sorry, Kate.  I haven't told many people this, but when I was young -- younger than you...I lost a child too."
kate,I'm...I'm really sorry.
principal barnes,"It's okay. It was a long, long time ago. Still hurts sometimes. But eventually...you move on. You have to.  Have a seat."
kate,I freaked out -- a student asked why I wasn't fat and I just froze up and then another student was saying I killed my baby and I didn't know what to do.
principal barnes,I'm not angry with you -- but I need to be clear that this doesn't happen again.
kate,It won't. I promise that.
principal barnes,"By ""not happening again,"" I mean that you don't discuss any controversial topics -- things the school board deems ""family matters"" with your class.  No sex. No god. No drugs and alcohol."
kate,"Okay, I..."
principal barnes, I know this all must be hard for you --
kate,No. You don't understand.  I have to be honest with you.
principal barnes,What do you mean?
kate,Principal Barnes...I wasn't ever pregnant.
principal barnes,But...you vomited in class.
kate,I know. And when that happened I didn't know what to do because the truth is --
principal barnes,"Oh, my god -- are you really ill? Is it cancer?"
kate,"No, well, yes. I have a disease, but, um...  ...it's alcoholism."
principal barnes,What?
kate,I've been working on it. I'm one- hundred days sober. When that happened I'd been out drinking and was hung over and --
principal barnes,You vomited in front of children because you were hung over?
kate,Yes.
principal barnes,"And lied, saying that you were pregnant?"
kate,"Well, a student asked if I was pregnant -- and ""yes"" just kind of fell out of my mouth."
principal barnes,"That's sick, Kate."
kate,I know.
principal barnes,"No, I don't think you understand how wrong that is. To lie to me -- to the children. You know I felt so terrible for you when I found out that you had a mis -- ?  -- how can you play with people's emotions like that?"
kate,I was sick.
principal barnes,Jesus...you told us you had a miscarriage.
kate,I'm sorry.
principal barnes,I threw you a baby shower.
kate,"I'm really sorry. I am. I've been wanting to tell you the truth because honesty has become really important to me. I'm in AA now and doing the steps and working with a sponsor and everything.  It's really hard. I mean, I think my husband might hate me, and --"
principal barnes,"I'm sorry, but what you did is totally irresponsible."
kate,I know.
principal barnes, I can't have you here anymore.
kate, Am I being fired?
principal barnes,"No, no -- the state wouldn't allow that without a report. I'm not going to write a report. Because, frankly, I have no idea what that report would say.  But I'm forcing you to take a leave of absence and I think it's in your best interest if you find a job elsewhere."
kate,"Listen -- I'm really sorry, but I'm doing the right things now."
principal barnes,I believe you -- or I want to. I really do. But honey -- I believed you before.  I'll have a sub take over your class starting tomorrow. It's late enough in the year that we can just say you're having personal problems --
kate,Principal Barnes --
principal barnes,Not another word. I'm upset right now -- very upset -- and I think I'm doing you a favor by not reporting you.
kate,Thank you.
kate,I told Principal Barnes about everything.
kate," Oh, God -- no. I told her that I'm an alcoholic. And that I lied. And she fired me."
kate,"I've been going to AA and trying to be sober and this is what it got me.  Fired, for telling the truth."
kate,I'm a fuck-up. I'll always be a fuck up. I'm just like my mom.
kate,I gotta go.
bartender,What do you need?
kate,Whiskey. Double.
bartender,"Sure -- you gotta pay for the first one, though. Eight bucks."
kate,Why?
bartender,Cause you're pretty drunk -- and it's four p.m.
kate,What about him?
bartender,I'm just trying to be a pal.
kate,"Stop it -- you aren't my pal. I just got fired, and I just quit AA.  It didn't work."
bartender,"Oh, boy..."
kate,"You know what? I was fine -- had a husband that loved me and maybe I sometimes did embarrassing stuff, but it was a phase. "
bartender,"Wow, okay, well...I'm real sorry. But this place gets a little nuts after sundown and I don't think a pretty girl who just left AA should be here.  I'm gonna call you a cab."
kate,NO! I don't want a cab. I want --  -- drugs. Can you hook me up?
bartender,"Lady, you're done."
kate,You think I'm above smoking crack? `Cause I'm not. And are you really gonna tell me you're not a little attracted to me...?
bartender,No.
kate,Just a teensy bit...?
bartender,Not in the slightest.
kate,"Well...you might want to consider investing in glasses, buddy. `Cause I'm a...a stone cold fox. And I'm smart. And I'm..."
bartender,I think it's time for you to go home. Now are you gonna let me call a cab?
kate, NO! I'm not. I've got friends. They'll pick me up.
bartender,You do that.
kate,I'll call Mr. Davies. He has dreams about me.
bartender,Hope that works out for you.
kate,Can't believe my luck. I just want to get drunk and a bartender won't let me.  Life is stupid.
kate,Davey-wavey...I called you. Why'd you bring her?
kate, Parole officer.
kate,How `bout we drive to Mexico and party our asses off? My treat.
kate, Fuck off.
charlie, Babe -- you gotta hear this with the speakers hooked up. It's insane.
kate,I'm drunk. I'm fired from my job.
charlie,"Oh, no..."
kate,We got any drinks?
charlie,Uh...we have soda. I can make coffee.
kate,Don't be cute with me. You know what I mean.
charlie,So...I guess you aren't doing the AA thing anymore?
kate,What gave that away?
charlie,What's going on?
kate,I'm celebrating. What the fuck does it look like?
charlie,I don't know what the right thing to do here is.
kate,"Okay, so let me see if this makes sense: you say you miss the old Kate -- the Kate who drinks and blacks out and has fun.  Well...here she is."
charlie,"Baby, I didn't mean that. I was just being a jerk."
kate,Fuck yeah you were. And what? Now you won't drink with me?
charlie,"I don't know. Having a beer or something is one thing, but...I think you really may have a problem."
kate,Well thanks for all the support when I was trying to be sober!
charlie,I'm sorry. I didn't realize --
kate,Of course you didn't realize! You don't fucking care about me.
charlie,What are you talking about?! Of course I care about you. I love you.
kate,I love you too. Love is the easy part. It's the rest of the shit that's hard.
charlie,Look -- I think you should get to sleep. You're really wasted.
kate,I don't wanna sleep. I wanna fuck.
charlie,"Please, will you stop?"
kate,No! I want you to fuck me!
charlie,Really. This is weird.
kate,Be a man and fuck your wife!
charlie,No! Jesus -- what the fuck is wrong with you?
kate,"With me? With me?! What the fuck is wrong with me? I try hard and I get shit on! Fucked up family, fired from my job -- this marriage. Nothing's wrong with me! What's wrong with YOU?!"
charlie,"Kate, you need to --"
kate,What? What? What do I need? I can't drink because I'm crazy or something and I can't stay sober because of you!
charlie,You're blaming other people for your problems.
kate,I can't be sober and be with you.
cut to black., FADE IN:
kate,You tell me.
kate, Thanks.
kate,"Hey, I'm Kate, alcoholic."
group,"Hi, Kate."
kate,I've heard that your best day drinking is worse than your worst day sober.  ...I'm really grateful for this boring new life of mine.  Kate smiles and steps down from the podium as people CLAP.
owen,"I was in North Carolina for a while                     * -- Durham -- playing minor league ball. I had some real heat. That's when I met Crash, here.  He's really taught me some...important life-lessons."
millie,Wow...that's a pretty crazy way to meet.
owen,Yeah. It is.
millie,You guys are sorta like that movie...what's it called?
owen, Do you know what movie she means?
millie,"""Bull""...something? What is it?"
charlie,I write about music.
millie,Really?
charlie,Yeah...I do freelance for a lot of magazines. But print really is dead. So now most of my stuff winds up on websites. Which is depressing. `Cause you can't hold it -- you can just look at it. It's like...
millie,Like what?
charlie,Huh?
millie,"You were talking about writing for websites and you kinda trailed off, honey."
owen," So, Crash -- why don't you tell this nice lady about the 21 days you were up in ""The Show,"" and what the crowds were like, and --"
charlie,It was crazy. I...
millie, You want a ride...?
owen,"Yeah, he'll be fine -- on his bicycle."
millie,He rides a bicycle?
owen,"Oh, yeah -- "
charlie, Uh...yeah. Thanks.
charlie,Miss our house?
kate,Um...yeah. Sometimes.
charlie, Miss me?
kate,Sometimes.  I've been sober for a year.
charlie,Really?
kate,Yeah.
charlie,They gave you that?
kate,Yeah. A couple of days ago. Tuesday.
charlie,"Oh...wow. Congratulations. That's really...really...just great. I mean it.  Parallel lives, huh?"
kate, Charlie...
charlie,Are you?
kate,No.
charlie,"Me either. Owen keeps trying to get me to be his ""wing-man"" and it's ridiculous and these girls in bars are so lame and I just keep thinking how I wish I was meeting you in a bar for the first time and I didn't come with any baggage and I could buy you a drink and flirt with you all night and ask for your number.  Wanna go out sometime?"
kate,I don't think it's a good idea.
charlie,"I fucked up, didn't I?"
kate,"Charlie, please don't do this."
charlie,I miss you. I miss the way you taste and smell and...I miss things about you that used to drive me nuts! I miss you liking shitty 80's music and fake punk-rock from the 90's...
kate,I don't like shitty 80's music.  I like good 80's music.
charlie,"...and all I want to do is touch you one more time to just, remember -- to make sure it was real.  Silence. Kate looks Charlie in the eyes and gives him a slight smile.  CHARLIE  Or...maybe I'm a just a delusional fucking idiot."
kate,You look really thin.
charlie,Yeah?
kate,When did you last eat?
charlie,"I dunno -- like...I'm not sure.  I think, um..."
kate,Should we order something?
charlie,"Sure, yeah -- or I could make a bacon and egg sandwich..."
kate,I don't know. I haven't really been doing the meat thing.
charlie,"Jesus. It starts with alcohol. Then meat.  Have you given up fun, too?"
kate,Fine. Bacon and egg sandwiches. But I'm gonna make them.
charlie,Okay...
kate,I don't care if you drink a beer.
charlie,You sure?
kate,Yeah. Whatever.
charlie, No...I'm good.
charlie,Have you been playing a lot?
kate,I haven't played in over a year.
charlie,Then how're you beating me?
kate,I don't know. Innate talent?
charlie,I haven't met anyone even vaguely interesting since we separated.
kate,"Um...stick to the game, okay?"
charlie,I've been masturbating like crazy.
kate,Charlie --
charlie,I miss you.
kate,Stop it.
charlie,Okay. Fine.
kate,You could've been killed.
charlie, What?
kate,Riding your bike -- drunk.
charlie,But I wasn't.
kate,But is that really the point?
charlie,What are trying to say?
kate, I worry about you.
charlie," That makes me happy...I mean, it fucking sucks that you're better off without me but I'm glad you're doing well."
kate,"You should go for yourself, not to make me happy."
charlie,"But, would you?"
kate,I'm not moving back in.
charlie,We can always turn the lights on.
kate,I don't know...
charlie,"So, would you at least...let me take you out on a date?"
