sophia,"Malcolm, look at them. Have you ever seen white breasts like these?"
sophia,"...That isn't a whore?  Knowing she's right, Sophia becomes the aggressor.  A beat -- both panting -- then Malcolm stops abruptly. He raises his hand to his face, then to Sophia's hand which is still caressing him."
sophia,"That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run."
match cut, CLOSE EARL LITTLE  Earl Little's face is in the same exact position as Malcolm's from the previous scene. His mouth opens in terror as the moving trolley comes closer and closer to the black man lying on the tracks.
sophia,"You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?"
sophia,Me?
laura,"Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart."
laura,"I do know I love you.  Laura stops him and moves to him. Her kiss is a tender one, exploratory. Then Malcolm responds, embracing her fully. Her arms go around him as they both drop into the sand.  CLOSE - MALCOLM AND LAURA"
laura,"Oh, Malcolm, I love you. Please, there's no one around. Now?"
laura,Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.

ANGLE - AIDES and OTHERS come into the room now. They are listening.  ELIJAH  Yes, the white devil will watch your every step. Even your own Brothers will become jealous, and hostile, go slowly.

coed,"Mr. X, I've read some of your speeches and I honestly believe a lot of what you say has truth to it. I have a good heart. I'm a good person despite my whiteness. What can the good white people like myself, who are not prejudiced, or racist, what can we do to help the cause?"
malcolm's voice,--you can see my burglary hangout. I lived like an animal. Had it not been for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad I would surely be in an insane asylum or dead.
malcolm's voice,"Okay, last hug."
betty,Because you're in trouble.
betty,"Dear heart, because I know you."
betty,I'm not made of glass.
betty,We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
betty,The talk is everywhere!
betty,"We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more."
betty,"""Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since"
betty,To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
betty,"No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in ""Muhammad Speaks"" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own."
betty,"Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!"
betty,A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
betty,"What do we have, Malcolm. A broken-down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance."
betty,Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
betty,We need you too!
sister lucille,"This is Saudi, she's 3 and you have Lisha, she's 2. Brother Minister the Honorable Elijah Muhammad is the father of my 3 children."
sister lucille,Yes sir.
sister lucille,"Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want."
elijah,Did you see the papers today?
betty,"C'mon girls, it's bedtime.  The phone rings. Malcolm answers it. From his expression we know it is a threat call. He hangs up. Betty leaves with the kids."
sidney,You're my father.
malcolm's voice,My darling Betty. Everywhere I go I am welcomed as the representative of our people.
malcolm's voice,"I wonder who he's working for? If I was a betting man, I'd say CIA. What's your guess?"
malcolm's voice,"Today, with thousands of others, I proclaimed God's greatness in the Holy City of Mecca. Wearing the Ihram garb I made my seven circuits around the Kaaba; I drank from the well of Zem Zem; I prayed to Allah from Mt. Ararat where the Ark landed. It was the only time in my life that I stood before the Creator of all and felt like a complete human being."
malcolm's voice,"You may be shocked by these words, but I have eaten from the same plate, drunk from the same glass and prayed to the same God with fellow Muslims whose eyes were blue, whose hair was blond and whose skin was the whitest of whites. And we are brothers, truly; people of all colors and races believing in One God and one humanity. Once before, in prison, the truth came and blinded me. It has happened again..."
malcolm's voice,"In the past, I have permitted myself to be used to make sweeping indictments of all white people, and these generalizations have caused injuries to some white folks who did not deserve them. Because of the spiritual rebirth which I was blessed to undergo as a result of my pilgrimage to the Holy City of Mecca, I no longer subscribe to sweeping indictments of one race. I intend to be careful not to sentence anyone who has not been proven guilty. I'm not a racist and do not subscribe to any of the tenets of racism. In all honesty and sincerity it can be stated that I wish nothing but freedom, justice and equality: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all people."
malcolm's voice,"My first concern, of course, is with the group to which I belong, the Afro-Americans, for we, more than any other, are deprived of these inalienable rights."
malcolm,"Certainly, we will work with any groups, organizations or leaders in any way, as long as it's genuinely designed to get results."
voice,You're one dead nigger.
voice,"You're days on this earth are numbered, brother."
betty,Get some sleep.
betty,"Dear heart, I love you."
second reporter,Do you know what Muslim headquarters is saying?
malcolm, I can imagine. I did it myself. For the publicity.
assassins,Allah Akbar.
coed,Mr. X. I have a good heart. I'm a good person despite my whiteness. What can the good white people like myself who are not prejudiced do to help the cause of the Negro?
coed,"I will, Mr. X, I will."
voice,That red nigger of yours is dead and so are your bastard children.
betty,Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
betty,"Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?"
betty,"Dear heart, where are you?"
betty,I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
betty,Say thank you.
betty,Somebody call an ambulance. Somebody call an ambulance.
