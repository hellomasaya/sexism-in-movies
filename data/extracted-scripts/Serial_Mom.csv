dad,"Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. "

mom,Misty's date...
carl,More of a friend really...
misty, See what Birdie gave me to sell at the flea market?
carl, That guy's a weirdo.

dottie," FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!"
mom, I beg your pardon?
dottie, Who is this?
mom,Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company.  I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.

mom, What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
dottie,I can't say it out loud. don't use bad language.
mom, I know it's hard but we need the exact words.

dottie, GODDAMN YOU!
dottie,MOTHERFUCKER!!
mom,COCKSUCKER! 
mom,"Rosemary, honey.  Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering."
mom, Just the damn cable TV company. You know how they are. Did you hear about Dottie Hinkle?
mom,Who on earth would want to harrass poor Dottie Hinkle?
mom,"Hi, Betty.  Oh, I love your outfit."
mom," You're soooo funny, Ralph..."
mom, Right here!
mom, A little something I baked.
mom,Bon Appetit!
mom, He's a good boy.
mom,"What is it, Mr. Stubbins?"
mom, He is assistant manager of a video shop...

birdie,"Hi, Mrs. Sutphin."
mom," You kids.  Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home."
chip,"But Mom, the video's not over."
mom,"No ""but mom"" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. "

chip,"Looks good, Mom!"
dad,"Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey."
mom,"Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... "
misty,"Yummy.  Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer."
mom," Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know."
chip,Carl's a jerk!
dad,He certainly drives like a jerk.
misty," Carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?"
dad,"Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy."
mom,I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
chip, I'm so happy I could shit.
mom,CHIP!  You know how much I hate the brown word!
mom,That's Rosemary.  Something's wrong!
misty, Murdered?
chip,Who?
chip, MR. STUBBINS?  That's my math teacher!
dad,What channel?
chip,Hello.
birdie, Did you hear?
chip,What happened?
birdie,This is so cool! It's just like a horror movie.
chip,It's on!  I'll call you back! 
announcer,..Police claim the driver of the hit and run vehicle ran down the teacher in cold blood and then backed up over his body to finish off the job. Mr. Paul Stubbins was thirty-eight years old...

announcer,...So far only one eyewitness has surfaced.
luann,It was a blue car...I know that much!
chip,That's Lu-Ann Hodges!
misty,She's a pothead!
luann,...A blue station wagon...
mom," Turn it off, honey."
chip, I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
misty,You said you hated him.
chip,Well...he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!
dad," Goodnight, honey.  Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow."
mom, I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
dad,"Goodnight, honey."
mom,Don't I get a kiss?
dad, I just thought with all the sadness...you wouldn't want...
mom," We have to concentrate on life, Eugene."
dad," You want to, honey?  You think the kids are asleep?"
mom,We can be real quiet...
dad, I love that you're my wife.
mom," You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird..."
dad, You bring me such peace...
mom,"Oohhhh, Eugene!"
dad,Shhhh..
mom, Oooohhhh.
dad,Don't wake the kids...
mom, Ooohhhh!
mom,Oooohhh!  Yeah!  Yeah!
dad," You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet!  Shhhh! The kids!"
mom,Yeah!  Oohhhh!  Get it!
dad,"Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now!  Now!"
mom, Oohhhhh!  Yeah!  Yeah!
mom, There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee!  He's here every morning for breakfast.
dad," Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know.  No wonder Dede's hungry.  It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore."
dad,Hello...
dad,"Well, Mr. Sterner, if you call my office, I'm sure we can see you Monday."
dad," All right, Mrs. Sterner... Nine o'clock."
dad," I'm sorry, honey.  But the birds will still be there next week."
mom, CHIP!!
chip, What's the matter?
mom," Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work."
chip,You scared me.
mom,"Honey, what's the matter?"
misty,I'm stoodup!  I'll kill that bastard!
mom,"Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. "
misty,It's him!
mom,"No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers."
misty," Hi, Detective Moore."
mom,A fine man.  A good teacher...

dad,"Good morning, Detectives."
birdie, Nightmare on Calverton Court!
scotty,The Maryland Teacher Massacre!
mom," Yes, I did."
dad," Detectives, what is this about?"
dad,Surely you don't think Beverly was involved!
scotty, SHE DID IT!  Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
mom," From what I understand, the eye-witness is a drug user."
misty,"I got somebody you could run over, Mother!"
dad,"Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave.  My wife knows nothing about this terrible ...accident."
mom," Murder, honey."
scotty," Now, here's a babe!"
misty, Nice buns!
mom, ...People who don't mind their own business.
mom, I recycle my magazines.
mom," ""It's Daybreak"" If you want to believe It can be Daybreak!..."""
mom,"Don't forget me, boys!  All rinsed and ready to recycle!"
gus,"Morning, Mrs. Sutphin."
mom,"Morning, Gus.  Hello, Sloppy.  Here you go.  You work hard for the environment.  A little drink never hurt anybody."
sloppy,"Thanks, ma'am.  Do you believe that goddamn litterbugger?"
mom, I've told her!  It takes ninety to one hundred years for a tin can to decompose but she still won't recycle.
gus, Cost taxpayers millions of dollars last year but she don't care about the national budget!
mom, I HATE Mrs. Ackerman.
gus, I hate her too.
sloppy, Somebody ought to kill her!
gus," Yeah, hack her up and recycle her!"
mom," For the sake of this planet, SOMEBODY JUST MIGHT!"
joan, ...But your boyfriend was convicted of killing twelve people
hag,I don't judge him.
joan,How can you love a mass-murderer?
hag,Easy!  He's handsome.  He's famous.  AND WE GET CONJUGAL VISITS!
joan, SERIAL HAGS!  Woman Who Love Men Who Mutilate!  We'll be right back after this!
dottie,Turn it off.
dottie,She scared me.
mom," Hello, Dottie.  I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles..."
dottie,It's not fair!!
mom, Are those pussy-willows?
dottie, What did you just say?
mom," PUSSY-willows, Dottie!"
mom,Dottie!  Watch what you're doing!
dottie, I didn't do it!
rosemary, My Franklin Mint Faberge Egg!
mom," Dottie didn't mean to be a clumsy ox.  She's sorry, Aren't you, Dottie?"
dottie," Rosemary, I didn't break your egg - she did!"
mom,"And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!"
dottie," But...but...she...Rosemary, I heard her voice!  It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!"
dad,"Mr. Sterner, you've lost a tiny filling.  I have to drill deeply enough to remove all the decay."
dad,"Mrs. Sterner, please stay in the waiting room!"
receptionist," Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Sutphin, but there's two police detectives here to see you..."
dad," What is it, officers? My patient is waiting."
dad,Bird books mostly...
dad,"I'm sure those are my son, Chip's books."
dad, THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!
mom,Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
misty, Can I help you?
customer,Just looking. 
misty,Thanks for not buying anything!
mom,"Misty, lighten up.  It's not the customer's fault Carl stood you up!"
vendor,"Yes, ma'am, it is."
vendor,That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
vendor,"Nice one, huh?  Winter's coming.  Three dollars?...I guess that's what I marked it..."
mom," Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?"
mom, You want me to keep that under the table for you?
sexpot date," Honey, pleeease?  For my little knick-knack shelf?"
carl, Wrap it up for the little lady.
boy,I can't believe it!  Fuckin' Don Knotts!
girl, It's beyond ugly!
misty, There you go...
mom, I made a killing!
mom," It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?"
mom,"Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary."
pervert,There was a lady in the men's room!  I swear! A pretty little lady in the stall right next to me!
mom,That's one-hundred fifty-eight dollars.
dealer,Will you take a New York check?
mom,Certainly.
misty,Mother!  It's Carl! He's dead!
mom,"0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!"
misty, Mother!  Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom!  I saw his dead body!
mom, You got your wish.
misty, I didn't wish...I didn't want him DEAD!
news announcer,"...Updating the top story of the hour, the young man brutally murdered a short time ago in the mens room of the Edmonson Flea Market has been identified as 22 year old Carl Padgett of Towson..."
misty,Chip!  Our mother is Charles Manson!
misty, I'm not kidding.  Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
chip,MURDERED?!!
misty,Yes murdered!  You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too.  I don't know...maybe Mom's nuts!
chip,"It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom!  Better yet, a TV series!"
birdie,Can I borrow your mother? My aunt is coming over to dinner tonight and she's always on my nerves.
kid,My step-father is an asshole! She could kill him!
chip, Should she be the next victim?
misty,No!  Stop it!  It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
scotty, Is there a reward or anything?
mom,Dinner's served!
dad,Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
mom,"Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!"
dottie,Nice as pie she was to me and then I hear her say it!
dottie,"""Are those...""  I can't say the word out loud."
dottie, Maybe...
policewoman,"It's ok...nobody's gonna hurt you.  Come on, let it out..."
dottie," ""PUSSY"" she says to me! ""PUSSY WILLOWS!"""
chip," You know Mom, Scotty thinks you're the killer!"
misty,She's gone!
misty, She's gonna kill Scotty!
dad, BOTH OF YOU!  GET IN THE CAR!
chip, DAD!  YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
misty,I DO!  Mom's gone crazy!
dad, C'mon!  Hurry!
mom,"""...Ain't no time to grieve And it's Daybreak!!! Let it shine, shine, shine, All around the world!!"""
rookie,MAY DAY!! MAY DAY!!
dottie,You rotten mother-fucker! You lousy cock-sucker!
misty," Turn right on Timonioum Road. Hurry, Dad!"
chip," If Mom's a psycho, Scotty will still be ok, won't he?"
dad,"We hope so, son.  And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway."
mom, Always brush after every meal!
mom," ""SHOUT IT OUT""."
mom,"You'll pay for that, Ralph Sterner!!"
dad,"Home Sweet Home!  Everything's fine, kids!"
misty, I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
chip,"I'm disappointed she isn't!  For a while there, it was like being in a movie!"
mom," Anybody for dessert? M-m-m-m-m, strawberries!"
misty," Dad, I thought it was ok. Make them go away.  This is embarrassing."
dad,Just ignore the police. It's all a terrible mistake.
chip,"Think we'll get on ""A CURRENT AFFAIR""?"
dispatcher, Negative.  D.A. says no bust until lab report is back matching suspect's fingerprints on true-crime book with those on scissors and fire poker.
announcer,"...the senseless killing last night of Towson couple, Ralph and Betty Sterner, brings to a total of four murders police feel may have been committed by Baltimore's first serial killer..."
dad,Beverly!  Not the Sterners!
mom," It's a shame.  But they should brush their teeth, honey."
announcer," This just came in.  Police Lieutenant Ronald Habbler has publicly named a suspect in the serial killer case and it's a shocker!  She, that's right, she has been identified as Beverly R. Sutphin of 2815 Calverton Court..."
misty,Oh God!  Now I'll never get a boyfriend!
dad," Beverly, I've been reading all about it...is it menopause?"
mom,"Oh, honey!"
chip,"Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really!  Are you a serial killer?"
mom,"Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies."
dad," Don't worry, Beverly.  We're going to get you good psychiatric help."
reporter," So, Mrs. Sutphin!  Tell me! Are you ""Serial Mom""?"
mom,Who?
dad, No comment!
chip, WOW!
father stone," Blessed be God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit..."
all,"And blessed be His kingdom, now and forever.  Amen..."
captain johnson,"This is Captain Johnson from Homicide.  Lab reports confirm Sutphin latent print of index finger on true-crime book matches those latent prints lifted from murder weapons.  Bingo, boys! Bust the bitch!"
father stone,"...Jesus said nothing to condemn capital punishment as he hung on the cross, did He?!"
father stone,"...If ever there was a time to go on record against the death penalty, WASN'T IT THAT NIGHT?!..."
father stone,CAPITAL PUNISHMENT is already the LAW in the State of Maryland!...
father stone,"...SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR, FELLOW CHRISTIANS?!  LET'S JUST DO IT!!"
all,AMEN!
father stone,"Now, let us pray and humbly confess our sins unto Almighty God."
congregation,"...Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned against thee..."
dad,...we are truly sorry and we humbly repent...
mom, ...so that we may delight in thy will...
mom,...And walk in the ways to the glory...  ...of Thy name...
all,Amen!
scotty,THERE SHE IS!!

mom, Do you think I'll need a lawyer?
chip, You need an AGENT!
dad,NO COMMENT!  PLEASE!  My wife is missing!  I'm worried sick about her!

misty," Hi, Hank."
dad," MISTY SUTPHIN, GET IN THIS CAR!!"
chip,"In here, Mom..."
mom,"But, Chip..."
chip,"Get in, Mom!  I have to open."
mom,This is so silly. 
birdie,"Good morning, Mrs. Jenson."
chip," Sorry, ma'am."
chip," Sure do.  Did you bring back ""Ghost Dad""?"
chip," Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!"
chip,Because it's the rules!
chip, You see the sign!  It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar
birdie,What a bitch!
chip,It's the influence of all those family films. 
birdie, Mrs. Sutphin?
chip,Mother? 
birdie,"0h, shit!"
chip,You don't think....
birdie,She wouldn't...
chip, What's Mrs. Jenson's address?
birdie,"...Jenner...Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson.  3511 Clark Avenue!"
chip,That's right up the street! Come on!  Just in case!
chip, Come on!
mom,"""Tomorrow!..Tomorrow!..Tomorrow! I love you..."
birdie,"I saw blood!  And it's brown! Not red like in horror movies, but brown!!"
chip, Is MOM...in there?
birdie,No!  IT WAS REAL!
birdie,"Oh God, I think I'm going to be sick..."
mom,WEAR YOUR SEATBELT!  IT'S THE LAW!!
mom, Give me your fucking van before I kill you!
scotty," Dear God...I promise I'll never watch a sex film again... I promise, I promise...."

doorman, I.D.?
scotty, Can I give it to you inside?
doorman,"Hey, buddy.  NOBODY gets inside without I.D."
doorman, Birthdate?
scotty, Please!
doorhan,"Ok, go ahead,"
mom,Hi! I know your mom...
mom,Excuse me.  Age before beauty...
mom, Sorry...the police are after me...
doorman," Hey, you're Serial Mom!"
mom, I guess I am.
doorman," Welcome to Hammerjacks, ""Serial Mom""!"
mom,"Thank you so much, you kind, kind creature."
mom,Excuse me...coming through...  Bill Flowers!  You're underage!
bill," Don't kill me, Serial Mom!"
mom," Just say NO!  And COMB YOUR HAIR, young lady!"
girl, AND SHE'S A HEAVY METAL MANIAC!!!
mom," Buckle up, Scotty!"
dad, Beverly is devastated by the charges against her.
court tv,"...And you, ma'am, how long have you been waiting to get in?"
mom," Hi, honey!"
mom," Kids, did you do your homework?"
judge,Quiet in the courtroom! Court is now in session!
mom, I like your jacket!
judge," Mr. Nazlerod, your opening statement."
chip, Well...they sort of deserved it...
dad, Shhhhh!
herbie hebden,"...Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm Herbie Hebden and you and I have a tough job ahead of us..."
herbie hebden,...I have known the Sutphin family for sixteen years...
herbie hebden,"...Dad, Eugene, is my dentist..."
herbie hebden,...Chip and Misty played with my own children...
herbie hebden,...but I've found out I don't know Beverly Sutphin at all!
herbie hebden,...No one really knows Beverly Sutphin...
herbie hebden,...You see...  ...Beverly Sutphin is INSANE!!
mom, I AM NOT!
herbie hebden, ...but that doesn't make her a bad person.
mom," Your honor, I have a motion. I would like to fire my attorney, and defend myself!"
herbie hebden,"Beverly Sutphin is not guilty, by reason of INSANITY!"
mom,"Oh shut up, Herbie!  I have the right to defend myself, your honor.  I've read the lawbooks!  ""Ware vs. State, 1964"", and ""Schutte vs. State, 1962""."
judge,"Mrs. Sutphin, a defendant who has herself for a lawyer has a fool for a client...  Approach the bench!"
judge," Mrs. Sutphin, I have no legal choice but to allow you to take over as your own attorney."
herbie hebden," You'll get my bill, I mean it!  A big one!"
judge, How do you plead?
mom," NOT GUILTY, your honor!"
dottie, I certainly did.
dottie,"Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together."
dottie, I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
mom,Mrs. Hinkle...do you drink?
dottie," No, I don't."
mom,So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
dottie,I certainly was not!
mom,You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's...the day you claim you recognized my voice...you weren't drinking?
dottie," One beer with lunch is hardly ""drinking""."
mom,So you do drink?
dottie,Socially...I'll have a beer.
mom,So you admit you just lied?
dottie," NO I DON'T, YOU BITCH!"
judge,"Sustained.  Watch your mouth, Mrs. Hinkle."
dottie," Did you see her?!  She just said ""Fuck you"" to me!"
mom, Let the record show I'm just standing here.
dottie,"FUCK YOU TOO, YOU WHORE!"
judge,"I'm warning you, Mrs. Hinkle. One more obscenity and I'll charge you with contempt of court."
mom," Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?"
dottie,"NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!"
judge, Lock 'er up!
dottie, YOU COCK-SUCKER!  YOU LOUSY PIG-FUCKER!
chip," ...Well, you tell ""Geraldo"" to go to hell!  I don't care what Jeffrey MacDonald's people got - he's old news!  We fly first class or we don't do the show!"
young man,Are you Chip Sutphin?
chip," Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent..."
young man,Your mom killed my brother!
chip," That's cool...hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?"
young man,That's right.
chip,"I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?"
young man, You mean for TV or print?
chip,"TV, man!  Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!"
young man, Farrah Fawcett?!  Who's gonna play my brother?  Is Jason Priestly available?
misty,"Get your ""Serial Mom"" T-shirts while they last! $19.95 plus tax!  Master Card or Visa!"
misty," Thanks, ma'am.  Signature here and home phone."
mom," Detective Bradford, if I was to look through your trash can, what reading material would I find?"
judge,You may answer.
mom," ...It's called ""Chicks with Dicks""."
mom,"Don't judge people by what they read, Detective.  Your witness, Mr. Nazierod."
det bradford, I'm a married man!!
judge,The jury is instructed to ignore the outburst of the witness.
mom," Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?"
mom,Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
mom,"Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!"
mom," That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?"
mom," And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?"
mom," Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?"
reporter, Sure.  You think she did it?
judge,Huh?...oh yeah...YES.
judge," I loved you in ""The Burning Bed""!"
cop,MR. PICKLES!  MR. MARVIN PICKLES!
marvin,Be right out.
cop,The Judge is waiting for you!
marvin,Marvin A. Pickles.
marvin,"Yes, I was."
marvin,I...um...  uh...
marvin,I...1'm not sure...  ...I...oohhh...Excuse me...
marvin, There was nobody next to me:
marvin, Ohhhh!  I just said what you told me to!
marvzn,Ooohhhhhh!  I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
mom, The defense also rests!
farrah fawcett,"...I feel that Beverly Sutphin is an innocent woman, wrongly accused.  A normal housewife trapped in a nightmare of circumstantial evidence..."
farrah fawcett,"...I only hope that I can portray ""Serial Mom""'s life on the TV screen with the proper dignity that this feminist heroine deserves."
mom, Look at me!  I'm a normal person just like you are!
mom,...But I've been framed by the police...
mom,...and perjured against by the very people I thought were my friends...
