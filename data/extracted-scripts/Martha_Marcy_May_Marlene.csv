martha,Thanks.
lucy,Ted should be up from the city soon. He'll cook us some dinner.
martha,"I'm pretty tired, is it okay if I just go to bed?"
lucy,"Of course.  Get some sleep, you'll be as good as new tomorrow."
ted,Well?
lucy,She seems okay.
ted,What did she say?
lucy,"Not much, she's pretty tired."
ted,Where's she been?
lucy,"She had some boyfriend, they were living in the Catskills."
ted,What?
lucy,It's okay.
ted,Not really Lucy.
lucy,It's fine. She's here now.
ted," Well, how long's she staying?"
lucy, I don't know.
ted,I told you she was fine. You spend all that time worrying.
lucy,Martha? Why are you on the floor?
martha,I'm sorry.
lucy,"It's okay, you were in a deep sleep. Come have some breakfast."
ted,Martha! Welcome!
martha,Hi.
ted,Great to finally meet you. You sleep alright?
martha,Yeah.
lucy,How do you like the house?
ted,It's just a rental.
lucy,Well I love it.
martha,It's nice. I didn't know there was a lake.
lucy,Yeah. Do you still like to swim?
martha,You don't live in the city anymore?
lucy,We do. This is for weekends and holidays.
ted, Do you think she's excited to have you back?
lucy,"This is the view, the interiors are obviously not finished. It's nice right? "
ted," Yep, just a little while longer."
lucy,"Okay, sorry, no more work talk."
martha,"Not really, sorry."
ted,"Well, you've got to eat."
lucy,"It's okay, I can fix you something later."
martha,Where are we?
lucy,Connecticut.
martha,How far are we?
lucy,From what?
martha,Yesterday.
lucy,You mean where I picked you up?
martha,Just wondered.
zoe,Put out your cigarette.
martha, Why?
zoe,Just do it.
martha,Is that him?
zoe,Yeah.  Hey!
patrick,Is this Martha?
martha,Hi!
patrick,How're you doing?
martha,Great. You've got a really nice place here.
patrick,It's as much yours as it is mine.
zoe,I did.
patrick,It's disgusting.
zoe,I know. I'm sorry.
patrick,"Don't apologize to me, it's your body."
zoe,I will.
martha,"She's been great, everyone's been great."
patrick,Good.  You look like a Marcy May.
martha,Marcy was my grandmothers name.
patrick,"Well, there you go."
martha,Sure.
ted, Brilliant choice of swim wear.
lucy,Martha! What are you doing?
martha,What?
lucy,"Would you put some clothes on, you can't swim naked."
martha,Why?
lucy,You just can't. There are kids around and people come by.
martha,So?
lucy,"So you can't. We don't, just don't. I have a bathing suit you can borrow."
lucy,Martha!  I've been trying to wake you. You should get up or you won't sleep through the night.
martha,I will. I'm just going to sleep a little more first okay?
lucy,Okay. I'm sorry I got frustrated with you before.
martha,It's okay.
ted,She's not coming?
lucy,She's in a really deep sleep. I can't wake her.
ted,"She seems a bit off, no?"
lucy,"She's just really tired.  She's had a bad breakup. I want to give her a couple days to get situated, you know?"
ted,Has she always been like this?
lucy,"A pain in my ass, yes."
max,Hey Marcy.
martha,Hey Max.  Where do they go at night?
max,"I don't know, I never get invited."
martha,"I shouldn't. I'm not going to drink for awhile, I think it's a good idea for me."
max,Alright.
martha,Patrick'll know.
max,"It's cool, I'm good at hiding it."
katie,We switch off jobs each day so we all know how to do different things.  Do you knit?
martha,No. I can learn though.
katie,"It's okay, you'll find your role. It takes time for people to find their role in a new family."
martha,When do you think that'll happen?
katie,Hopefully by the end of the summer but we'll see. It's hard to get machinery and live stock without cash.
martha,That'll be nice.
katie,Shoot.
patrick,How's everything going so far Marcy May?
martha,Good.
patrick,You like it here?
martha,"Yeah, it's really nice."
patrick,I want you to feel at home.
martha,I do. Thanks.
patrick,People have abandoned you your whole life. I don't blame you for not trusting anyone.
martha,What?
patrick,"If you ever want to have a meaningful relationship, you need to let your guard down."
zoe,"Yeah, we think you're fucking awesome."
patrick,If you're going to live here then really be apart of things.
lucy,Good morning. How are you feeling today?
martha,Good.
lucy,"There's this great juice shop in town, I got us a couple of juices. "
martha,"Maybe that's better. Sorry, thanks."
lucy,I also got a box of these protein bars just in case you want to snack.
martha,Why is the house so big?
lucy,It's not that big.
martha,"For two people, it's huge."
lucy,We like to entertain. Our friends come up for weekends and sometimes we have parties. It's just good to have space.
martha,So no one else lives here?
lucy,Of course no one else lives here.
martha, You're married?
lucy,Yeah.
martha,When?
lucy,"Earlier this year, in the spring."
martha,I lost it.
lucy,You never got a new one?
martha,I got used to not having it.
ted,Cocktail anyone?
lucy,No thanks.
ted,Martha?
martha,Was it a big wedding?
lucy,"No, about forty people. Mostly his family."
martha, Did Aunt Dora come?
lucy,Yeah.
martha,Did she smoke like chimney and complain about everything.
lucy,She's not that bad.
martha,You never had to live with her.
ted,You lived with Dora?
martha,She lived with me after mom died.
ted, Where were you?
lucy,College.
martha, She hates me.
lucy,She doesn't hate you.  Look at me.
martha,I hate her.
lucy,"Relax, I don't have any pictures of you.  Jesus you're gorgeous. It's annoying."
martha,Is it true married people don't fuck?
lucy,What? No!
lucy,Put this on.
martha,You're kidding.
lucy,"Your clothes are disgusting Martha, just try it."
martha,Why does it matter?
lucy,It just feels good to put on something nice and comfortable.
martha,Whatever makes you happy mama bear.
lucy,You're making fun of me and I think it looks really good.
lucy,It's no good?
ted,"It's good, it's just, a bit dry."
lucy,It's not dry.
martha,You microwaved chicken nuggets and fish sticks.
katie,"I know you feel like something bad just happened Marcy May, but you have to trust me, that was not bad, it was truly good. We've all been in this situation, and we wouldn't all still be here if what happened in that room was bad. We all love each other very much, we are all together on this, you have to trust us.  Do you believe me?"
zoe,"You're so lucky, I'd give anything to have my first time again."
martha,Really?
zoe,"Yeah, it's so special."
martha,"I can't remember anything, I just woke up on the floor and felt this pain -"
zoe,That's the cleansing. It's good. It means it's working if you can't remember things. You're cleansing yourself of the past and the toxins.
martha,I'm not.
zoe,"So smile then, enjoy this amazing night. It only happens once."
patrick,This one's called Marcy's song.
ted,What are you doing?
martha,Cleaning.  I thought I'd help out more.
ted,"Alright. I'm going to take the boat out, do you want to come?"
martha,Is Lucy coming?
ted,She had to run to the city.
martha,Oh.
ted,"I'll teach you how to drive the boat, come on."
martha,It's okay.
ted,Come on.
ted,You want one?
martha,Yeah.
ted,How have things been with you and Lucy?
martha,Fine.
ted,Is it strange to spend time together?
martha,No. Why?
ted,It's been a long time.
martha,"I don't know, it's normal I guess. She hasn't changed much."
ted,At the doctor.
martha,Why?
ted,She's getting a check up.  We're trying to have a baby.
martha,I can't imagine it Lucy holding a child.
ted,Why?
martha,She wouldn't know what to do with it.  Do you want a baby?
ted,"I want what Lucy wants.  If she's happy, I'm happy."
martha, So you're unhappy!
ted,No. She's good. She's relieved to have you back. You had her worried.
martha,Why?
ted,You disappeared. You haven't called in two years!
martha,I lost track I guess.
ted,It's good to let people know where you are Martha. People worry.
martha,I didn't think Lucy would worry about me.
ted,"Well, she did."
martha,Can I go swimming?
ted,You don't need to ask.
patrick,You jump yet?
martha,No.
patrick,Go on.
watts,You ready?
martha,I can't.
watts,Sure you can.
lucy, What? What?
martha,Nothing!
lucy,"Jesus, you can't just come in like that."
martha,Sorry.
lucy,"God damn it, what's wrong?"
martha,It's been hard to sleep alone.
ted,All you do is sleep.
lucy," Stay, just stay."
martha,"I don't know. It's a big bed, you guys were on the other side."
lucy,"You can't come into our room when we're having sex, that's not normal! It's private."
martha,Sorry.
lucy,"Don't apologize, I just want you to understand why it's not okay."
martha,Okay.
lucy,Do you?
martha,Yeah.
lucy,Well?
martha,Because it's privte and it's not normal.
lucy,Just lie down Martha.
ted,This is just brilliant.
lucy,I'm sorry you slept out here. Thanks for being patient.
ted,I don't have much choice do I?
lucy,I just want to make sure she's okay.
ted,I get two weeks a year to come out here and try to relax before I have to go back to work!
lucy,I know.
ted,I am under so much pressure right now-
lucy,I know you are.
ted,I have a month to get this building up and running or the bank takes it.
lucy,That has nothing to do with Martha.
ted,"My point is, I don't need the extra stress."
lucy,I'm her only family. She needs to be able to depend on me right now.  It's complicated Ted.
ted,"As complicated as it might be, we can't just keep ignoring the fact that her behavior is fucking insane."
martha,Do you ever hear things hitting the roof at night?
lucy,No. Maybe it's the pine cones.  Where did you pick up gardening?
martha,We had a garden where I lived?
lucy,You're good.
martha,I'm good at some things.
lucy,I know you are.
martha,Who?
lucy,Your boyfriend.
martha,What do you mean?
lucy,"Did he ever, hit you?"
martha,No.
lucy,"You had a bruised ear, and when you called me you were hysterical."
martha,Yes.
lucy,You can tell me.
martha,He never hit me.
lucy,I wish you felt more comfortable talking to me.
martha,I do.
lucy,So talk.
martha,"There's nothing to talk about. I had a boyfriend, he lied to me, I left. That's it, everything doesn't have to be a big DEAL"
katie, Don't stare!
martha,You okay?
zoe,Yeah. He's right. I don't know why I'm so weak.
martha,You're not. You'll quit.
katie,Her name's Sarah I think.
martha,You think?
katie,You're ready. Zoe can help but you'll be great.
martha,Just curious.
lucy,"There's a hiking trail, people leave their cars there all the time."
lucy,Sorry.
young man,It's okay.
lucy,You're going to hurt someone.
martha,What's wrong with the tap?
lucy,I like bottled.
martha,It's a waste.
lucy,Will you get it or not?
martha,Did you know that guy?
lucy,What guy?
martha,The guy in the store.
lucy,The one you almost ran into? No.
martha,He was looking at me like he knew me.  Did you say something to him?
lucy,Like what?
martha,"I don't know, you tell me."
lucy,What are you talking about?
martha," He was staring at me like he knew me, did you talk to him about me?"
martha,Just drive the car Lucy.
lucy,What?
martha,Drive the car!
katie,That's enough.
lucy,I'll do these if you want to go to bed.
martha,I don't mind.
lucy,Get some sleep.
martha,Okay.
martha,"Oh, hi."
sarah,Hi.
martha,"Nothing you don't want to. Drink this, it will help you relax."
sarah,Do I have to wear this robe?
martha," I know it seems a bit silly, but it's a part of it."
sarah,Thanks.
martha,Shouldn't we start cooking?
lucy,I just made some potato salad. Ted's cooking the fish.
martha,I thought we were going to cook.
lucy,We cooked last night.
martha,"Oh, yeah."
lucy,Not really.
martha,No.  Like what?
lucy,I don't know.  I'm just trying to figure out why we stopped talking.
martha,I didn't think about it.
lucy,Really?
martha,We were far apart.
lucy,"Sometimes I wonder if, maybe I could have taken better care of you."
martha, The past doesn't matter.
lucy,It does matter.
martha,I took care of myself.
lucy,I know you did. I think I could have done more though.
martha,Stop it.
lucy,"Be honest with me, you never think about it?"
martha,No.
lucy,You're not angry at me?
martha,I know you don't think much of me but I knew what I was doing then and I still do.
lucy,"No, Martha, I think the world of you, I'm just wondering if I should have come back and kept you in school and helped you go to college, you had so much potential."
martha,"I don't need your guidance, I never did. I'm a teacher and a leader, you just never let me be that but now I know I am, I know who I am."
lucy,"Teacher and a leader? What are you talking about? I always encouraged you to do more, but you shut me out."
martha,Just because we're sisters doesn't mean we need to talk about everything that comes into your head.
ted,So what are your plans Martha?
martha,For what?
ted,Life.
martha,I don't know.
ted,Are you thinking about what you can do for work?
martha,No.
ted,You're at an age where you need to start thinking about a career.
martha,Why?
ted,It's a part of adult life.
martha,There are other ways to live.
ted,Really?
martha,Sure.
ted,Like what?
martha,"I don't know. People don't need careers, people should just exist."
lucy,He's just saying we should start talking about what you're interested in. Maybe we can help you get some ideas together.
ted,I have moments when I would love to move to France and just exist but it doesn't work that way.
martha,You can do that if you want to.
ted,It's not that simple.
martha, It's not your fault but you learned that success is measured by money and possessions. It's just not the right way to live.
ted,And what do you think the right way to live is? Being a hysterical mess and causing your family pain. You're eating my food and sleeping under my roof so watch your mouth. You're rude.
martha,You don't know anything about it.
woman,Hello...Hello.
martha,Who's this?
woman,Who's this?  Zoe?
martha,She not there?
woman,She's not.
martha,Where is she?
woman,Who is this?
martha,Who is this?
woman,It's Marlene Lewis. Who's this.
ted,Jesus Christ you scared me.
martha,Sorry.
ted,Did I wake you?
martha,No. I can't sleep.
ted,Me neither. I was going to watch a movie.  You want to watch?
martha,I should try to sleep.
ted,It always helps me. It's better than lying in bed awake.
ted,"I'm sorry about before, Martha."
martha,It's alright. It's your house.
ted,You want me to make some breakfast?
ted,What's wrong?
lucy,You can not be serious right now.
ted,What?
lucy,"One minute you're going after Martha at the dinner table, then you're curling up together on the couch?"
ted,No one was curling up with anybody.
lucy,You really do think I'm stupid don't you?
ted,"Jesus, I couldn't sleep, I was watching a movie, she came out and sat down and started watching with me. What am I supposed to do, tell her to leave?"
lucy,"You can lose your temper at will but when I get pissed off, I'm being crazy or ridiculous! I couldn't possibly be mad for a reason."
ted,"Are you accusing me of something? Because if you are, I'd like you to say it out loud so you can hear how absurd it sounds."
lucy,Fuck you. I just want you to think about how walking in on that might make me feel.
ted,You ask me to make more of an effort. I try to do that and you get upset. I can't win.
lucy,You're unbelievable.
martha,You shouldn't smoke.
lucy,What? I don't smoke.
martha,Especially if you're trying to have a kid.
lucy,Maybe you should mind your own business.
martha,What's you name?
bartender,I'm sorry?
martha,What's your name?
bartender,Mike.
martha,I used to like this.
bartender,Straight?
martha,I thought you weren't supposed to drink Mike.
bartender,I'm not drinking.
martha,You think you're so fucking smart.
lucy,"Hey, what happenind?"
martha,We all need to leave.
lucy,What?
martha,He's a fucking liar. We all need to leave.
lucy,What are you talking about?
martha,We have to leave. We all have to leave. I know him.
lucy,Who?
martha,You don't want to live with this Lucy.
lucy,Martha.
ted,Calm down.
lucy,What are you talking about?
martha,They're here.
lucy,Breath.
martha,"Don't touch me, you're not listening to me!"
lucy,Martha please try to breath. I don't know what you're talking about.
man,What the fuck.
watts,"Hey, we can go."
man,What do you want?
watts,Nothing.
patrick,"Calm down, if you calm down no one will get hurt."
man,What do you want?
patrick,"We're not stealing, we don't want anything."
man,Just get out.
patrick,We're just looking at the house. It's nice.  We didn't realize you were home. We wouldn't have come in otherwise.
man,Just Leave.
patrick,I would but I can't be sure you won't call the police.
man,"I won't. You didn't take anything so just go, I just want my family to be safe."
patrick,"Safe? Why wouldn't anyone be safe. Unless you call the police, everything will be fine."
man,"Okay, I won't. You have my word, please just go."
patrick,Look at me.
martha,Uh huh.
patrick,"You know that death is the most beautiful part of life, right? Death is beautiful because everyone fears death. And fear is the greatest human emotion of all because it creates complete awareness. When you're scared it forces you to be completely aware of your surroundings and the moment you're in. It brings you to NOW and that makes you truly present. And when you are truly present, that's nirvana, that's pure love. So, death is pure love."
lucy,"It's too hot, let it cool for a minute."
martha,Thanks mom. I'm sorry I ruined the party.
lucy,Everything was fine.
martha,Is it over?
lucy,"Yes, you slept through the night."
martha,That's good.
lucy,Are you going to drink the tea?
martha,I don't want it.
martha,We have to do something.
watts,He's fine. Right Max?
max,"Yeah, I'm cool."
martha,Watts!
watts,"There's nothing to do Marcy, you need to get inside. Max is strong, he'll be fine. Right?"
max,"Yeah, I'm good Marcy. Stop."
martha,How long do you think we'll be down here?
zoe,It'll just be a few days. Just to be safe.
martha,Do you feel alright? If you hit your head you shouldn't sleep.
max,I'm fine.
martha,Do you know why we're down here?
max,No. Do you?
martha,What do you think it was?
max,I don't know. It doesn't matter.
martha,Do you still think about leaving?
max,"No. It's cool now, I don't really have anywhere to go. Why, would you?"
martha,No. I just wanted to see about you.
martha,Hello?
voice,"Hi, is Watts there?"
martha,Who's this?
voice,Jane. Is Watts there?
martha,Can I help you?
voice,Who's this?
martha,It's Marlene Lewis. What's your last name Jane.
voice,"Heller, sorry, do I have the right number?"
martha,"I don't know, do you?"
watts,"Hey. How are you? Sure, yeah, let's do it, I'll be around there on Friday. No, that was my cousin Marlene, yeah, I'll see you in a bit then. Great, I'm glad you called."
katie,Nothing till they're done. You know better.
martha,I know. Sorry Katie.
martha,What?
lucy,Who's Katie?
martha,"Oh, nothing."
lucy,Yeah.
martha,Is this from the past or is this now?
lucy,What?
martha,I don't remember waking up this morning.
lucy,"Why don't you go sit down, I'll finish up."
ted,What's going on?
lucy,Who the fuck knows.
ted,She needs to see someone.
lucy,I know.
ted,I'll start looking into places tomorrow. We can arrange for her to be somewhere by Wednesday.
lucy,Places?
ted,I don't think she should stay with us anymore. We can't do anything for her when she's like this.
lucy,I don't want to talk about it anymore.
martha,Zoe?
zoe,Yeah.
martha,I can't stop feeling terrible for that poor man.
zoe,"I know. It happens though, we're never really dead or alive, we just exist, so he's still existing, but it's in a parallel time. Just don't think about it, it's in the past."
patrick,Haven't you learned anything?
martha,I have.
patrick,I felt like we had a connection.
martha, We do!
patrick,That's not what you're showing me.
martha,I'm sorry.
patrick,Shhh. It's okay.
lucy,Are you alright?
ted,"She kicked me down the stairs. Jesus Christ, what's it going to take, Lucy."
lucy,You could have killed him.
martha,I was confused.
lucy,"About what, what are you so confused about?"
martha,I thought he was someone else.
lucy,"You thought he was someone else? What is wrong with you?  I'm not doing this anymore, I'm not doing this anymore. I beat myself up over you for years and I'm sick of it, I'm sick of chasing you down and worrying about you. I need to move on."
martha,I'm sorry.
lucy,You need help Martha.
martha,I know.
lucy,What happened to you?
martha, I don't know.
lucy,We're going to get you proper help.
martha,Are you going to send me away?
lucy,I don't know how to help you anymore.
martha, Please don't. Please don't.
lucy,I can't help you.
martha,"Please, I can't be alone, please."
lucy,We're trying to start a family and I don't trust you to be here.
martha,Lucy?
lucy,What?
martha,You're going to be a terrible mother.
lucy,Do you have any money left?
lucy,Going swimming?
martha,Yeah.
lucy,It's a bit chilly.
martha,I don't mind.
lucy,I think we both said some things last night that we didn't mean.
martha,Yeah.
lucy,We scheduled an appointment for you tomorrow morning.
martha,What's it like there?
lucy,It looks nice.
martha,Yep.
lucy,Are you okay?
ted,Yeah.
lucy,Fucking idiot. What was he doing?
