burke,"Even that cologne you liked.  See, Confederated Products is a multi- level direct wholesaling company. That means we don't just sell the products ourselves, we also recruit and manage teams who work under us. Irene and I started eight months ago and we're already bringing in fifty thousand a year in revenues."
irene,"We're the number four distributor in Southern California. By March, we might be number three."

adam,"And the ear thing. Hello, I have Q-Tips. That's really not necessary."
zack,The only thing I will give him credit for is the oral.
adam,What do you mean? He was terrible. At some point I just had to stop him and correct years of bad technique. I had to take him by the ears and retrain him from the throat up.

adam,"So even if she's alive, she's dead."
zack,Exactly.
zack,"On the plus side, the only witnesses are you, me and him. And none of us are going to want to be talking about it. So if you really think about it, it didn't turn out as badly as it could have."

jimmy shubert,"Somethin' about it just didn't add up. So last night I went back to the pier to do some investigating of my own. Turns out there are two boats named the Princess. Only, one just got back from two weeks at sea -- Sal Dominico's boat. It got me thinkin' -- if Chase really did know Carmen was on to him, how come he didn't tell Lucas, or Gamble, or Myerson? Why would he drive up to Pinecliff by himself? And why would you still have his briefcase?  Answer me that, Danielle. If you have an answer."
zack,I'm not the man you're looking for.
adam,We both know you were on the pier. You saw what happened to Carmen.
zack,"Don't forget, detective. I was cleared of all charges."
adam,I don't care how many high-priced lawyers you bring in. Eden Valley will never stand for your kind of scum.
