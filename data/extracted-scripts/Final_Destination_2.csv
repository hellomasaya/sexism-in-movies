Speaker,Dialogue
kimberly,"Thanks, Dad. I'll call you."
kimberly,"Relax, Dad. It's Daytona, not Mongolia."
shaina,"Just kidding, Mr. B. Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on her.  MR. BURROUGHS  Oh, that makes me feel a lot better.  Shaina throws her bags in, shuts the back and climbs in the SUV. Kimberly hugs her dad, kissing him on the cheek."
kimberly,"I know this is the first time we've been apart since. But everything's gonna be okay.  MR. BURROUGHS I know, honey. I just --  Kimberly hugs him tighter. Cutting him off."
kimberly," I know, Dad."
kimberly,"Sorry!   My fault!  Shaina looks over, concerned. In the backseat, the guys DANO and FRANKIE laugh hard and some of Frankie's milkshake comes out of his nose."
shaina,Want me to drive?
kimberly,"No, I'm good."
frankie,"Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?"
dano,Blo w me.
football players,"Pile up!    Pile up! Pile up!  Kimberly flicks on the radio and we hear HIGHWAY TO HELL by AC/DC at earsplitting volume. Kimberly and Shaina jump from the shock and reach to lower the volume.  Kimberly, disturbed by this, hits SEEK -- an oldies station. A GRISLY CAR CRASH from Nervous Norvus' TRANSFUSION album."
dano,"Christ, is this tribute to Princess Di Day or what?  Kimberly passes a car WEAVING on her right. The driver reaching into the back seat to quiet a BARKING DOG hanging on its head out the window."
kimberly,"  Jesus, all the crazies are out today.  A CLOUD passes Kimberly's head. She smells it and turns around, taking her eyes off the road to see Dano smoking a joint."
kimberly,"I told you no drugs in the car!    My dad will freak!  Dano and Frankie exchange looks, God, what a geek!"
dano," Calm down, Kimmy.   It's not drugs, just weed."
frankie,"Yeah, you should have specified."
kimberly,"Hey, Dad. What's up?"
kimberly,"You got it, Dad. I'll call you if I have a problem."
kimberly,"I will, Dad. Bye, luv you."
shaina,"Um, Kimberly, your dad's not gonna call like every ten minutes is he?  Before Kimberly can answer, Dano sees a CHP speeding up behind him. He lowers the joint at once."
dano," Shit! There's a cop behind us. Pull into the right lane now!  Kimberly, scared, does as she's told nearly colliding with a speeding flat bed semi hauling a huge load of logs !  A HORN BLASTS. The truck swerves. Then speeds by on the right. A COILED CHAIN drops down to the highway."
dano,"Look first, idiot!  Shaina turns up the radio and leans over to Kimberly."
shaina,"Ignore 'em.  ON LOG TRUCK  One end of the RUSTY CHAIN holding the logs in place rattles on the pavement, sparking.  Looking in her rearview mirror, Kimberly turns pale - the COP pulls in behind her."
kimberly,"Dano, put that out NOW.  Dano takes one last drag and flicks the joint out the window. It bounces on the windshield of a FORD EXPEDITION to their left.  INSIDE THE EXPEDITION  KAT, 28, very corporate America, wears a navy blue power suit and speaks into a phone headset while smoking a cigarette."
kat," No, I'm stuck on Jury Duty so I won't be able to pitch the campaign. Let's get Silverstein to come in and...  Kat sees the joint that smoulders in the dried leaves beneath her windshield wipers. A moment later, a small FLAME crackles."
kat,"What the hell?     No,   not you.  Kat flicks on her WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID, successfully putting out the joint, but her worn wipers smear ash and fluid around, impairing her vision.  Kat turns and looks at --  DANO, dead serious all of a sudden. Staring straight ahead."
dano,"What's the cop doing?      Did he see that?  Kat sees the tailgating CHP, smiles, then resumes her conversation."
kat,"Forget it, I'll call him myself.  Kat hangs up, then looks down at her cell phone, squints and dials a number...  PAN OFF KAT TO OFFICER THOMAS BURKE  Early 20's, rookie cop, who seems to have missed the entire exchange.  INSIDE THE POLICE CAR  Thomas speaks into his radio."
thomas,I was supposed to be off today. How did I get screwed?
thomas,"Copy that.  Go on, sleep it off Drake."
frankie,"Relax, dude.  But Kimberly still looks uneasy as her dashboard ""Check Engine"" light begins flickering.  Kimberly spots a road sign -- Next Service 18 Miles."
kimberly,This trip better be wor th it. What's the guy- girl ratio again?
shaina,"Get ready to smile, five guys per girl."
kimberly,I can live with thaaaa --
frankie,"What's your problem, ya fuckin' crack baby?!  INSIDE THE WHITE VAN  ISABELLA CRUZ, late 20's and VERY PREGNANT, drives a delivery van full of funeral wreaths, crosses and classic rose urns. Most are marked: In Memory of Flight 180.  She chokes back sobs into a cell phone as she pulls over."
isabella,"...couldn't Keep your dick in check for another month? I knew this would happen when I got pregnant.  She pounds the steering wheel, furious."
isabella,"What'd the doctor say? I have to come in to test for STDs? Goddamn  you, Jorge.  A CRATE in the back of her van topples over and CRASHES and a flurry of sunflower petals sails out the window. Isabella jumps in surprise and, wiping tears from her eyes, rolls up the windows as petals shower the visor of --  EUGENE, the Harley Rider, who smears the petals  around his visor and drops back.  INSIDE NISSAN SUV  Kimberly falls back into the right lane and looks uneasy as she sees a TRUCK DRIVER guzzling from a flask as it passes the SUV, revealing its side is an ad for FIRESTONE TIRES.  It finally clears frame, revealing a highway billboard that reads, ""DRUNK DRIVING KILLS.""  Kimberly reaches back and pulls on her seatbelt in spite of laughter from the back seat.  Up ahead, the RUSTY CHAIN seems to have more give to it. LOGS STRAIN against it.  Suddenly, a black cloud of exhaust from a blue '83 Chevette in front of them causes everyone to roll up their windows.  OIL DRIPS from its rusty exhaust pipe. The thick exhaust BLINDS Kimberly."
frankie,"Gas it around these idiots. We do have 1200 miles to go, you know."
nora,"Tim, will you cut that out? I can't even hear myself think.  Tim frowns and then winces, holding his jaw."
nora,"I know, we'll be there soon."
frankie," Ever hear of the Ozone layer, asshole?"
thomas,"Son of a bitch.  INSIDE TRANS AM  Its driver, EVAN SCHAEFFER, 21, flashes a cocky smile at Kimberly, clearly making Frankie jealous."
frankie,A Trans Am. That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
frankie, Who?
dano,"You know, Hasselhoff before he did Baywatch.  Evan, pissed off, flips off Frankie. The windshield wipers smear around the thick milky fluid. The sun blinding him."
kimberly,What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
shaina,How does a nice mature fuck sound?
kimberly,"Hey, thanks for talking    me into this trip. Ever since     my mom... I dunno, I just feel like    I'm starting to live again,    you know?"
frankie,"Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?"
dano,"Blow me. Yellow means go, Kimberly."
kimberly,"Oh my god, oh my god...  Dano, confused, rolls a joint."
shaina,What is it? What are you?
kimberly,There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die. All of us! I saw it!
frankie,"That's it. My turn to drive.  CLOSE UP - KIMBERLY SCREAMS!  AND WE'RE BACK  THE HIGHWAY ON RAMP  Sweating profusely, Kimberly's eyes dart around, taking in her surroundings."
frankie,"Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?"
dano,"Blow me.    Yellow means go, Kimmy."
kimberly,"Oh my God, oh my God...  Dano, confused, rolls a joint."
shaina,What is it? What are you?
kimberly,"There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!"
frankie,"That's it. My turn to drive.  HONK! The drivers behind them start leaning on their horns. Kimberly leans out the window and sees the Chevette, the Pacer, The White Van, the Trans Am, the Harley...all the familiar vehicles from the pile up. She turns on the radio, frantically scans the dial."
kimberly,"Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell."
shaina,"For Christ sakes girl, take a breath."
dano,"What the hell are you doing?  Dano shifts in his seat and sees - a Highway Pat rol Car ominously cruising up the shoulder of the onramp. He shoves a bag of weed, along with the joint, down his pants."
dano,"Five-O's coming!   Let's fucking roll, man!  Officer Thomas Burke stops the car behind them."
frankie,Jesus Christ! Here he comes! Move!
kimberly,No!   We'll all die if we do!
dano,I told you she'd ruin everything!
shaina,"Shut up, Dano, just stay cool.  He's just stoned."
thomas,What's going on here?
kimberly, There's going to be a pile up. Logs. Bodies everywhere. I saw it happen. It happened.
thomas,"Miss, please step out of the vehicle.  As she does, Thomas discretely unsnaps his holster. RORY nervously eyes the action. Sneaks a paper bundle into his sock. ISABELLA, the pregnant woman in the White Van, gets out. She gives Thomas her friendliest smile, milking the pregnant belly."
isabella,"Excuse me, but is there some way we could just drive around? I have a delivery.  Her CELL PHONE RINGS and she leans back inside to answer it."
isabella,"Hey hon, you got a mysterious caller on the answering machine from Planned Parenthood. What's going on?"
nora,What on Earth are they doing?
tim," Who am I, David Blane?"
tim," Okay, quit it already."
kimberly," The radio played the same songs, the old lady's bag broke the exact same way it did in my premonition.  Kimberly erupts into a panic when she sees the LOG TRUCK speed past. She grabs at Thomas for emphasis."
kimberly,THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
thomas,"Alright miss, calm down. I just need this lane open. I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!"
kimberly,You're not listening to me!   You have to do something!
evan,"Arrest this whack-job, wouldja? Some of us have lives, y'know.  Kimberly looks to Shaina for support, but even Shaina can't meet her eyes."
kimberly,"Why won't anyone listen to me?  Thomas, subtly reaching for his cuffs."
thomas,"I'm not going to tell you to calm down again --  A SERIES OF CRASHES AND EXPLOSIONS ARE HEARD. In the distance. It's neverending. Horrific. Kimberly's face crumbles. She screams in horror and collapses against the SUV.  Thomas runs to his patrol car.  The White Delivery Van makes a J- turn out of the line of cars and SPEEDS down the onramp in reverse, Isabella screaming angrily into her cell phone."
isabella,"You couldn't keep your dick in check for a month?!  The other drivers exit their cars, craning their necks to see what's happened up ahead. Kat takes a deep drag off her smoke."
kat,"Great, now I'm really gonna be late.  Thomas barks into the radio handset --"
thomas,"L.A. 51, I need assistance and requesting paramedics for a major T.A. At --  INSIDE THE SUV  Frankie watches the traffic start to back up as a couple of passing cars BRAKE HARD. Shaina anxiously watches Kimberly pacing behind the SUV."
shaina,"Kimberly, what's going on?"
evan,"I don't know what you want from me. Some crazy chic k blocks the highway with her car, said there'd be an accident and there was. Big deal. Even a broken watch is right twice a day..."
kat,"Not to sound insensitive, but how much longer is this going to take?"
eugene,"If I don't get back to my classroom soon, the kids'll tear the room apart."
nora,Those poor people. To think it would've been us if not for...
thomas,Tell me again how it started.
kimberly,"Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything. The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face..."
thomas,Do you remember what triggered it all?
kimberly,"The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did."
thomas,"You knew? You just mean a hunch, right? A bad vibe, maybe?  The other drivers stare at Kimberly."
kimberly,More than that. All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  His car was leaking oil all over the road.
rory,"Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette."
kimberly,"Billboards about accidents. Kids yelling ""pile up"" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like... "
thomas,Like what?
kimberly,"I know this sounds crazy...but you all heard about Flight 180, right? The kid who got off the plane?  Thomas' eyes widen -- then a startling CRASH as Rory, le aning back in his chair, tips over. Thomas rolls his eyes as Rory grins sheepishly and picks himself up."
thomas,You mean Alex Browning.
kimberly, ...My Premonition was just like his.
nora,What are you talking about?
nora,Maybe...
eugene,"But this is where it starts to get freaky. So a month goes by, everything seems cool, but then the survivors start dying one boy one. 'Cause when your number's up, it's up, right? Some people said Death itself started coming for them, hunting down every last one, until they were all dead.  Everyone tenses up."
thomas,"Well, not quite all of them. Clear Rivers checked herself into a padded room at Stoneybrook.  Kimberly, affected, looks to Thomas for confirmation."
kimberly,"You do believe me, don't you?  BANG! Everyone jumps as Detective Suby pounds on the door and opens it."
detective suby,"Officer Burke? Could I see you in here?  INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS  The DOOR OPENS. Detective Suby enters, leading Thomas. Through a two - way mirror, they can see the others chatting anxiously."
detective suby,Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
thomas,"Look, you weren't there. It was weird. She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind."
detective suby,"I thought we we re finished with this bullshit. This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line."
kimber ly,"But if I was never meant to pull over, then we all should have died in the pile up."
tim,Which means Death could be coming for us.
detective suby,"Way to console the witnesses Burke.  At the same time, we watch Evan enter the other room, grab his jacket and wave goodbye to the others."
detective suby,"You got 'em thinking Death is after them? Shit, they're the luckiest sons o' bitches on the planet. Get this guy Evan Shaeffer; Yesterday the kid wins the lotto and today some looney bitch b locks traffic and he avoids the worst pile up in years. I should be so damn unlucky.  INT. A ROOM - CONTINUOUS  Kimberly, Nora, Tim, Kat, Eugene and Rory now seem affected by what they've heard."
kat," What if it's true? What if it's happening all over again?  The fluorescent light above FLICKERS ominously. Nora, disturbed, stands up in a huff, grabbing Tim's arm."
nora,"You're all certifiable, you know that? I can't believe I've been listening to this crap. Come on, Tim, let's go outside."
tim,"Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'."
eugene,"Look lady, we're just yankin' your chain."
rory,"Yeah, you're acting like we all just got the Diff'rent Strokes curse or something."
nora,"What's wrong with you people?  Nora pulls a reluctant Tim out of the room. As she opens the door, the others watch Detective Suby and Thomas appear from nowhere to calm her down . When the door swings shut, an awkward silence. Suddenly, the door opens again and Thomas leads Mr. Burroughs inside. Mr. Burroughs sees Kimberly and chokes back tears."
detective suby,"Sure, you can all go."
kat,"First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense."
rory,"Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season."
kimberly,"I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others. I've got this terrible feeling."
kimberly,That it's not over yet.
evan,"Motherfucker.  A HEATING DUCT CLICKS ON. The air blows a TONKA TRUCK slowly toward the center of the staircase, directly in Evan's path - but Evan just misses it!  He continues past MORE TOYS, nearing the top stair -  The Airduct coughs, sending menus fluttering toward Evan's feet and he slips on them! He juggles the TV - but ultimately rights himself and continues down the hallway.  INT. EVAN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS  Dim, cheap, probably roach-infested. As Evan enters, the small packages fall off the TV box and onto the floor.  Evan places the TV by the door, looks at his torn shirt, but fuck it, who cares; he's on a natural high. He peels his shirt off, revealing his PIERCED NIPPLES, flicks on the radio and DANCES his way over to the fridge and grabs a drink.  In the tiny kitchenette area, a small swarm of flies hovers over a grease-filled frying pan.  Evan recoils, throws open the window and throws the grease to the sidewalk five stories below. An ominous BREEZE enters --  And a kitchen cabinet slowly BLOWS OPEN. Some FORKS and KNIVES slide forward on poorly stacked plates. Daring to fall into the toaster.  Evan spills some cooking oil on the range while pouring it into the frying pan, then dumps in some frozen mozzarella sticks. Evan puts the frying pan on the stove and turns it on HIGH.  He then grabs a container of CHINESE FOOD and rests it on the counter next to the fridge. On the fridge, several colorful MAGNETS spell out HEY E.  PUSH IN on the H - which mysteriously drops into the Chinese food - the word EY E remaining. Oblivious, Evan puts the food in the microwave and turns it on.  ANGLE ON STOVE  The cooki ng oil creeps toward the range... Evan hits PLAY on his answering machine and rushes across the room to tear open his packages..."
evan,"Damn it!  Evan reaches INTO THE DRAIN, his fingers searching for the ring. When he tries to pull his hand back out, the ROLEX CATCHES.  Another small EXPLOSION from the microwave, this one cracking the GLASS. A Solo Plastic Cup nearby begins to melt.  Flames sputter around the rim of the frying pan. In moments, the oil from the pan IGNITES. A small fire.  Evan sees all this and YANKS with all his might. No use. As the FIRE slowly spreads to nearby cereal boxes, Evan starts to panic. He continues yanking... Stuck.  He sees a bottle of PALMOLIVE on the other end of the counter. His fingers reach for it.  Slightly out of his grasp. But his fingertips are just long enough to knock the bottle backwards - where it rests against TWO SWITCHES.  The FIRE ALARM goes off. The PHONE RINGS.  Evan desperately lifts his leg and tries to use his foot to edge the Palmolive over. By pushing the bottle up against the wall, it threatens to turn on one of the switches.  ANGLE ON FINGERS  In the GARBAGE DISPOSAL. A SWITCH is flipped - but the light goes on. And the Palmolive lazily falls, resting on the remaining switch."
evan," Come on, come on...  Evan makes one last push with his foot - accidently flipping the SWITCH - the GARBAGE DISPOSAL GRINDS METAL!  Evan, horrified, miraculously yanks his hand free, brushing against the knife in the toaster.  When the SHOCK goes through Evan's body, his other hand jerks out, knocking the flaming frying pan to the floor.  The entire kitchen is in flames, including the new TV blocking the door. The window slams SHUT! The room fills with smoke."
evan,"Jesus Christ!  Evan grabs a fire extinguisher. A mere dribble of foam comes out. He begins COUGHING in the smoke.  Evan tries the window - STUCK! He has no choice but to smash the kitchenette window with the fire extinguisher to get to the fire escape.  He dr ops the fire extinguisher, starts to climb out the window, hears a creak and looks up just as --  A large jagged shard of glass comes CRASHING down at him -- Evan jumps back just in time as it shatters before him. The fire completely engulfs the kitchen.  He bravely jumps through the window pane, landing on the fire escape. He runs down the fire escape from floor to floor.  A LARGE BLAST from his window showers him with glass and brick shrapnel, but ultimately, he makes it to the fire escape's lowest level, intact.  He tries to lower the rusty metal ladder to the ground. It budges once, then twice, but won't go down. So he climbs over the railing and gently drops to the ground.  Safe and sound, he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to walk --  SUDDENLY he s lips on the very grease he threw out the window, his legs shoot out from under him and he lands on his back.  The rusty ladder suddenly dislodges and hurls downward -- coming right for Evan's face -- but stops halfway!  As Evan laughs, breathing a final sigh of relief, it suddenly PLUMMETS again -- impaling Evan through his eye socket!  INT. POLICE STATION - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT  Thomas sits at the computer terminal. He checks to make sure no one's watching as he enters a SEARCH for Alex Browning.  Ten websites come up, all devoted to the Flight 180 Curse. Thomas scrolls around, seeing the death pix and autopsy photos of Flight 180 ""survivors"".  Headlines blare, ""Freak Accident?"" ""Bizarre Coincidence?"" describing the way the victims died. As Thomas begins a localized search of the word, ""PREMONITION"" --  SPOOKY HUMMING from behind him.  Thomas whirls around to see Det. Suby looking over his shoulder, humming the music from an old monster movie. Suby presses one hand to his forehead, the other polishing an apple against his vest."
detective suby," Ooooh, I see it now. Your future... A transfer to another department.  Suby bites the apple, casually offering nothing more. Thomas, embarrassed, flicks off the computer, stands."
thomas,You've made your point.
detective suby,Good. Cause we just got some new info and I don't ne ed you getting freaky on me.
thomas,What?
detective suby,Evan Shaeffer's dead. Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
kat,"No, Mom. Just turn on any station, they've been playing it all day.  Yes, Mother. Channel four will do just fine. Here it is, gotta go.  She hangs up the phone, mesmerized by the report:  FOOTAGE FROM A HELICOPTER shows the pile up wreckage."
kimberly,"Don't.   I have to see this.  Mr. Burroughs reluctantly keeps the newscast on.  INT. RORY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS  It's a party. Rory, surrounded by BUDDIES, shakes a triumphant fist at the television. HE WHOOPS with delight, spilling popcorn everywhere."
rory,"Whoohoo! You see that shit? Right there? That's my fuckin' car right there! Oh God, that's dope.  After high-fiving his peeps, he bends to table level and snorts a freshly chopped line."
nora,"Come on, Tim, lights out already.  Tim starts at her voice, then reluctantly puts down the book."
tim,Mom?
nora,Yeah?
tim,You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what?
nora,"Oh, please. Some people just need some serious rewiring, that's all."
nora,"Get some sleep.  Nora kisses his forehead and leaves the room. After she leaves, Tim opens his nightstand drawer, pulls out a dusty nightlight and plugs it in.  INT. NORA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER  Nora closes her bedroom door. And locks it. She nervously checks the closet and even lowers the blinds. Finally, she takes out a business card and dials a number. She hangs up, then dials again."
nora,"Officer Burke, please?  INT. KIMBERLY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS  Mr. Burroughs tucks a still-shaken Kimberly into bed. In one of his hands is a nearly empty glass of scotch."
kimberly,"It's okay, Dad. I'm not ten anymore.  Mr. Burroughs catches himself being overprotective."
kimberly,"I love you too, Dad.     Goodnight."
kimberly,"I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage. And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was. And the bad thoughts would go away."
physician,"...at the request of the patient, you are to relinquish any sharp objects such as nail files, pencils, pens, safety pins, bobby pins, no matches, lighters, belts, belt buckles, earrings, chokers, shoelaces...  Kimberly watches carefully as the Physician comes to a door and punches ""4514"" into the electronic lock. They continue down another corridor.  Lights flicker,patients cackle and moan in the B.G."
physician,"...paper clips, watches, food, drinks, keys, poisons, pills and medications.  You have a cell phone on you?  Kimberly nods, hands it over."
physician,Then I think we're all done.  They arrive at a door to a padded room. The Physician punches in another code.
kimberly,Wait. Is she...dangerous or something?
physician,"No honey, but she expects you are."
kimberly,"Jesus, how long are you going to keep her locked up this way?"
physician,"Depends on her, I guess.   She's voluntary."
kimberly,"Clear Rivers?  Clear looks Kimberly up and down and steps back, allowing her inside her inner sanctum. A mattress on the floor, a plastic bottle of water, some paperbacks and a bedpan.  Kimberly's jaw drops when she sees the far wall: a SHRINE to flight 180. The wall is papered with art icles about all the survivors .  The door SLAMS. Kimberly jumps."
clear,"Kimberly Burroughs, eh?    What do you want?"
kimberly,I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
clear," Yeah, how?"
kimberly,I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up. .. I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
clear,"Nice work. Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me.  But I doubt you'll survive that long."
kimberly,"It's not just about me. Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident. What if the others are in danger, too?"
clear,"Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up."
kimberly,What list?
clear,Death's list. The precise order you're going to die in.
clear,The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
kimberly," Exact order? Then I'm next! I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!"
clear,"But you said someone else died last night. That means Death skipped past you. Someone must have intervened.  Sometime yesterday you must have nearly died, but someone saved you.  Kimberly nods, recalling the events."
kimberly,Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
clear,"Congratufuckinglations. That makes you last to go. But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you. Always does."
kimberly,"That still doesn't make sense. You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to. But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition, not first."
clear,"It's moving backwards?    Are you sure?  Kimberly reluctantly strains to remember something...  HARD CUT TO:  THE FINAL MOMENTS OF THE PILE UP  Nora's Pacer folds like an accordion, then EXPLODES, followed by Evan screaming in the Trans Am, which gets CREAMED by the semi!  BACK TO:  Kimberly, shaken, does the math."
kimberly,"Yes. In my premonition that Nora woman and her kid died first, then Evan and then...my friends.  Clear is oblivious when Kimberly breaks into silent sobs."
clear,Backwards...that's new.  Clear sees Kimberly crying and softens.
clear,"That's good. Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs."
kimberly,Signs?
clear,"If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon. When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your- face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it. It usually means the difference between life and death."
kimberly, But wait. I don't understand.       Why is this even happening to me?
clear,That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
kimberly,"It's obvious you know what you're talking about. You beat it. You have to help us.  Clear suddenly toughens up, an abrupt mood shift."
clear,"I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it. Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others. That's the worst killer of them all."
kimberly,How can you say that?    What kind of monster are you?
clear,"My family is dead.   My friends are dead. And Alex...  Clear angrily peels a Polaroid off the wall and shows it to Kimberly. While we don't see the photo, Kimberly's horrified face paints a gruesome picture on its own."
clear,"And yes, that's the blade of a fucking ceiling fan in his head.  Clear pounds on the door, apparently done with Kimberly. A GUARD opens the door. Kimberly, devastated, turns to leave, then summons her courage and turns back to Clear."
kimberly,"Know what? I think you're a coward. I think you hide out in here because you're too damn bitter and selfish to care about another  living soul. In my opinion, you're already dead.  Kimberly leaves, giving Clear something to think about.  EXT. KIMBERLY'S HOUSE - DAY  As Kimberly pulls into her driveway, she's surprised to see a STRANGE CAR parked there. Then --  THOMAS, wearing street clothes, peers through the front window of the house. He guiltily backs away as Kimberly gets out."
thomas,I tried calling last night but your father --
kimberly,Evan Shaeffer's dead.
thomas,I know. I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
kimberly,Then you believe all this?? That Death is working off a list?
thomas,I didn't. Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
kimberly,Clean up? I don't...
ki mberly,"Did you see that??  Thomas, concerned for her, saw nothing."
kimberly,"Pigeons... It's a sign! If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacke d by Pigeons!"
thomas,I'm not following you --
kimberly,They're next on the list.   We have to find them.
tim, You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight? I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
nora,"Nice try, kiddo."
tim,Mom!
tim,You okay?
nora,"Sure hon. I'm fine.   Let's shake it, we're late."
tim,Not so much.
kimberly,Turn around. The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
thomas,Hold on.
tim,"What are they doing here? And why are they yelling ""pigeons""?"
thomas, Nora's not coming. She refuses to leave her son.
kimberly,We have to tell her she's in danger!
thomas," I did. And right now, I don't think she cares."
kimberly,It's happening again.   It's fucking
kimberly,But we're all going to die. We can't stop it. It's just a matter of time. I'm so scared.
thomas,I am too. But you can use that fear. It'll sharpen your instincts. Keep you alert fro signs. It's the only way you'll be able to sav e the others...and me.
thomas,"I know you didn't ask for any of this, Kimberly. But I don't think you have it in you to quit either."
kimberly,Clear/Thomas. Thomas/Clear.
kimberly, The second one just dies.   A 16 year old kid.
clear, I hope you're ready for this.
kimberly,This is cheery.
thomas,"Who is this guy, anyway?"
clear,A mortician. He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
thomas,Should we knock?
clear, He probably already knows we're coming.
mortician,"Hello, Clear. I've been keeping an eye out for you."
kimberly,Oh my God. That's Evan Shaeffer.
mortician,Come to... Pick my brain?
mortician," Flesh and bone require 1,600 degrees for cremation. Gold, prosthetics and other metals must be removed before the final --"
clear, Just a simple question and we'll leave you alone with your new friend.
mortician,Fire away.
clear,How do you cheat Death once and for all?
mortician,Dead.   But still fresh.
clear," Look, we drove a long way to get here. So if you happen to know how to get this death monkey off our backs, it sure would be swell if you told us."
mortician,For what purpose? You seek a back way out of a room with but one door. You can't cheat Death; there
clear,"Bullshit. You told me Death has a distinct design, a blueprint, unalterable. But Alex and I cheated Death not once, but dozens of times. If the design is flawed, it can be beaten."
mortician,Such fire in you now. People are always most alive just before they die. Don't you think?
clear,It can be beaten.   And you know it.
mortician,"Some say that there is a balance to everything. An equilibrium that is the connective tissue of the universe. They say that for every lif e there is a death, and for every death a life..."
mortician,"Solus novus anima licet evinco mortis; Only new life can defeat death.  The list of life is forever set by the Divine Plan, the guiding hand that plots the course of the universe, down to its tiniest element s."
mortician,"The list accounts for every life; from the dawn of man to the great apocalypse. But the introduction of life that was not meant to be, a soul forbidden to roam the earth, that could invalidate Death's list, shatter its very existence."
thomas,What the hell does that mean?
mortician, To figure that out you'll have to follow the sign s.
mortician,"But be warned. To disrupt the grand design is to unravel the tapestry of the universe. When you pull all the threads apart, you may find yourself hanging from them."
clear,One last question. Why is Death working backwards this time?
mortician," Sorry, time's up."
thomas,New life defeats death? Follow the signs? Where the hell did you find that guy?
kimberly,"Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful."
clear,"He was. If we can use your ability to see the signs, we can cheat Death long enough to figure out what ""new life"" means.  I know, it worries me that I"
clear,What the fuck are you thinking?
skate rat,"I'm thinkin', suck my junk, bee yatch."
thomas,What is it? What did you see?
kimberly,I...I...
clear,You're strong. Do you hear me? You're a fucking warrior. Nothing scares you. In fact you happen to be the single most powerful woman on earth. Now what did you see?
kimberly,I was driving a white van. It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned. It was...horrible.
clear,You were there?
kimberly,I can practically taste the water in my throat. And something else. The smell of flowers...
clear, Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
thomas,Remember the onramp? There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
clear,"Holy shit. He said ""only new life can defeat death.""  If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design..."
kimberly,It throws the entire Death list out of whack. And a new list has to be rewritten f rom scratch. We all start over with a clean slate.
thomas,"It sounds all well and good, but"
clear,"Please, what else could it mean?"
kimberly," So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby."
clear,So let's do it.
thomas," Shit, I don't have her number. She was never interviewed. She took off right after the accident."
kimberly,How are we going to find her? There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
thomas,"Hey, I'm a police officer, remember?"
kimberly,Oh God...
thomas,"I, uh...sorry."
kimberly,"I know, I know. We need my eyes."
clear,It's all right.    I'll take watch.
kimberly,I'm okay. Just caught me by surprise. Put it back on.
clear,Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
thomas,Taken care of.
kimberly,There it is.
thomas,Got it.
clear,I don't get it. Why is everything happening so fast? After Flight 180. A month went by before anyone died. And now five people are dead in less than a day.
thomas,"Here we go. The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz. And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two."
clear,We need to hurry.
thomas,Let's lay this on her gently now. The stress alone could upset the pregnancy.
jorge,What?
thomas,I'm Officer Burke.    I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
jorge,Shut up!!!
thomas,Are you Jorge Cruz?
jorge,Maybe.   What's this about?
thomas,May we come in?
jorge,No.   What's this about?
thomas," It's about your wife, Isabella. Now is she here?"
jorge,No.   I'm alone.
thomas,"Look, pal, it's probably nothing. But I need to see --"
jorge,"Forget it. You'll need a warrant. I know, I'm a lawyer."
jorge,Stop!!!   You can't go in there!!!
young woman,We never meant to hurt you Isa...You're not Isabella!
jorge,I'm going to sue your ass!
kimberly,Whose blood is that on the floor?
jorge,"Mine, you idiot. The dog went nuts this afternoon. Now arrest her!"
kimberly,Where's Isabella? Did you finally kill her you fucking wife beater?
jorge,"We had a fight. Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me. Wouldn't say where she was going."
thomas,What was the fight about?
jorge,Take a guess.
thomas,Does she have a cell phone?   A way we can contact her?
jorge,She did.
clear,We're wasting time with this piece of shit. Let's just get to the meeting.
jorge,"Hey, when you find her, tell her the kid's half mine."
clear,We can only pray it doesn't come out retarded.
man,Jesus Christ. I wrote to management two weeks ago about these friggin' bumpers.
rory,"Damn, is that dogshit?"
nora,Does anybody have a Valium?
kat,You'll want to take --
kat,-- half of that.
thomas, Any word yet on the Dodge van? Damn.
nora,So that would mean... I'm next.
eugene,Nobody's next. This is crazy. First death's stalking us and now premonitions?
kat,"This can't be happening. My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house..."
rory,Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
clear,"You're not next, Nora. Nobody has to be next. That's the point. Last time, we didn't plan. We weren't organized. Now we can help each other."
clear,Think what would have happened if Kimberly had been able to warn you with the word pigeons...
kimberly,"The point is, as long as you know what to beware of, you have a fighting chance. It can be beaten. If I call you and say subway, get to a high rise fast. A place where no subway could possibly go, get it?"
rory,"Why the hell did I ever get on Route 18 in the first place? That's me, Mr. Dumb Fucking Luck."
clear,Anyone read today's paper?   The article on Evan Shaeffer?
clear,The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
rory,That lucky bastard.
clear,"What about the rest of you? Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona. Was Route 18 your first choice?"
kimberly,"The new freeway was faster, but Route 18 was the way my mom used to take, so..."
thomas,"Route 18 is Drake's assignment, but he called in sick so I got...  Drake's never sick."
kat,I was my first day of jury duty.
eugene,Jury duty? That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
clear,"Random, sure."
eugene,"What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago? You're nuts."
rory,"Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means ""good luck"" in Jewish."
kat,"Eighteen. And it's ""Hebrew""."
rory,"Anyway, I guessed it right and won these."
rory,The best way to get to Yankee
kimberly,"I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance."
thomas," Whoa, nine months?"
kimberly,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
isabella,"Yes, I'd like to report a domestic squabble - my name? Isabella Cruz why, does it matter? I'm at the Super 8 motel. Yes, I own a white van. So what? Just get over here."
kimberly,"I'm sorry, Dad, we're having a hard time with Shaina's eulogy. I'll stay here at Virginia's tonight and see you tomorrow. I love you too."
clear,"Remember everyone, just because Kimberly's got the power doesn't mean we're not all capable of seeing signs to some extent."
rory,It's like Forrest Gump.
clear,Fuck. Should have seen that coming. The institution's made me soft.
eugene,"If Death has got such a hard-on for you, maybe you should get the hell away from us."
kimberly,"We need her. She's the only one who's dealt with this before, idiot!"
clear,We're all going to have to open our eyes from now on. Look out for each other. Sleep in shifts.  And we've got to safeproof this deathtrap.
kat,Screw this. I'm going outside for a smoke.
thomas,You think you should?     It's not safe out there.
kat,"So? Nora's gotta bite it before me anyway, right?"
kimberly,"Where are you going, Nora?    You okay?"
nora,Four years ago my husband died. Now Tim. There's nothing left for me.
kimberly,"Don't say that. Once you lose hope, it's already too late."
nora,"If it's my time to go, to be in heaven with my family, then I can accept that."
kimberly,"You can't give up. Don't accept Death's plan. Trust me, you can fight this. If we can just survive long enough until that baby is born, we can --"
nora,"If you'll excuse me, I have a funeral to prepare."
eugene,"Yeah, why am I listening to a girl who just got out of the nut house?"
kimberly,Seeing you die once was enough for me.
eugene,"Whatever. I control my life, not fate."
clear,I'll be sure to put that on your tombstone.
rory,"Be careful. And even if you don't believe, give this to Nora."
rory,...man with hooks. I see a man with hooks. Someone?!?!
thomas," I kinda see it, yeah. So...Nora's going to be killed by a man with hooks?"
eugene,"Going down, right?"
eugene,"Um, by the way, your shoe's untied."
eugene,"Probably for you, anyway."
nora,Officer Burke?   I can't hear...
eugene,What is it? What's wrong?
nora,Let me go let me go!
eugene,"Oh, watch it, you've caught your uh..."
man,"Goodness gracious, darling, let me help you with..."
kat,"You alright, Nora?"
nora,"My God, someone please let me out of this --"
eugene,"...no escapes my ass. I control my fate. I die on my terms, hear me Reaper cockscuker?!"
thomas,What the hell are you...?
eugene,Ain't going out like that.   On my terms!
thomas,Just take it easy!
kimberly,You don't keep it loaded?
rory,Maybe they were all duds.
thomas,Six in a row? Never. Impossible. That's like  ...winning the lottery.
kat,"Can we find the pregnant woman, please?"
eugene,"Um, Clear? I'm sorry...about before. I..."
clear,Your entire world view just went out the window. I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.
rory,Can I ask you a question?
kimberly,Sure.
rory,When I die. Is it gonna hurt?
kimberly,I...I don't know.
rory,"And you're gonna die after me, right?"
kimberly,I guess so.
rory," Could you throw all my drugs out? Paraphernalia, porno, you know... Anything that would break my mom's heart."
thomas,A one very pissed off Ms. Isabella Cruz is being detained up in Greenwood. Let's finish this thing.
rory,"Is this safe, guys? I mean, someone in this car is about to get whacked. Do the rest of us really feel like sitting next to him?  Or her. Hopefully her."
thomas,"Guys, let's not panic.   Isabella's safe."
kimberly,How do you know?
thomas,You said she was going to drive into a lake. How can she when she's in protective custody?
isabella,"What do you mean ""grand theft auto?"" This is insane."
steve,Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday mor ning.
isabella, Jorge. When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off.
is abella,Oh my God.
steve,"Are you kidding me?!   Oh, man."
steve,C'mon.    Let's go.
steve,"Damn, they always stick me with the clunker."
isabella,Take my van!
rory,"Here's what I don't get. For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up..."
kat,Yeah?
rory,"But why single me out? What am I in the great scheme of things? You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man."
thomas,"You want weird? Last year, my partner and I were heading out for the graveyard shift. A call comes in about a train wreck and Frank decides to let me handle it alone."
kat,"I got that beat. So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night."
rory,"Yeah, so what happened?"
kat,I never mad it. The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.
clear,Was that in Mt. Abraham?
kat,Yeah.   How did you know?
clear, That bus you were on? It killed Terry Mathers. She was supposed to
kat,I'm not sure I--
thomas,Shit. The call about the train wreck that saved my life? That was the night I scraped up Billy Hitchcock.
rory,Who?
isabella,Promise me...I won't have the
isabella,Get around it!!!
rory,"Remember the theater in Paris that collapsed last year, killed everyone inside?"
rory,"I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign."
clear,Carter.
rory,"Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show..."
eugene,Are you okay?
kimberly,"A little over a year ago, my mother and I went to the mall. I was supposed to meet her outside, but I got caught up watching some news report about some kid who committed suicide. I kept thinking, ""How can you strangle yourself in a bathtub?"" That's retarded."
kimberly,It felt wrong. And yet...  Some kids tried to jack her car. She fought them off - she was a fighter - and they killed her.
kimberly,After the funeral I had this overwhelming feeling that it should have been me. I figured that's how everyone must feel. But I guess I was right.
clear,"It's all starting to come together. When Alex got us off Flight 180, it didn't just change our lives. It"
eugene,I'm not sure I understand.
clear,Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
eugene,"So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be ali ve in the first place."
clear,"That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all"
steve,Hang on!
steve,"We're okay, we're okay."
isabella,Please.   It's not going to wait.
steve,I've got to stop and help those people.
isabella,Do you want to deliver this baby?
kat,Not my time.     Amazing...
thomas,Is everybody alright?
kat,He can't breathe!        He can't breathe!
clear,"Oh my god, Eugene!?"
thomas,"Stop it, don't move him!"
clear,Someone call for help!
kat,I can't move my fucking leg! Please get me out of here before it explodes!
rory,"Watch it, dude!"
kimberly,"Help us, we need help over here!"
brian," I don't smell any gas. And none's dripping, either."
kat,"Stop that! I still need this foot, thank you."
clear,"Be careful with that, check the gages on the regulator and be mindful of overdoses. Oh, watch for potholes and puddles."
clear,"Look, I made him a promise --"
paramedic,Sorry.   There's no room.
thomas,Get that over here!   Move move move!
rescue worker,"Excuse me, hot soup coming through."
clear,One more thing.   Watch out for power lines.
clear,We have to contact Isabella now!
thomas,Where's the cell phone Clear gave you?
rory,I dunno. I think I gave it to Eugene back at your place.
thomas,Damn it. We have to call the Greenwood Police Station and warn Isabella.
kimberly,You doing alright in there?
kat,"My legs are starting to cramp up. And God, why am I so thirsty? Does anyone have any Fiji?"
kat,"Christ, you wanna give me a heads up next time, pal?"
cop,She's at Phelps Memorial. They're prepping her to give birth right now.
thomas,Where's that?
cop,A few miles up the road.   Near the docks.
kat,"Damn, can't you be quieter with that thing?"
rescue worker," Sure, I'll just set it to the ""quiet"" mode."
thomas,We gotta go now.   Isabella's in labor.
kimberly,What about that?
clear," How you doing in there, hero?"
kat, I guess it could be worse.
thomas,So let's go...Where the hell is Rory?!
kimberly,Wait!
clear,Get back!
kimberly, It wasn't his turn.   And it's not my turn.
kimberly,Give me the keys to your truck. Now!
thomas, Hurry up. There's no time.   She's about to give birth.
kimberly,"No. If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me. But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive. I'm last on Death's list."
clear,Are you crazy? What makes you think you'd survive?
kimberly,What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
clear, Six duds in a row.
kimberly,"And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?"
thomas,"That branch fell and saved my life. You're right, Death's maintaining the order."
kimberly,Let's pray that Isabella's still alive.
staff,...contractions coming quicker now. Take her pressure and CTG. One centimeter dilation. Prep the epidural stat.
anesthesiologist,She's going to have to stop moving if I'm going to --
anesthesiologist,"Goddamn it, keep her still!"
nurse,"Sorry, doctor."
anesthesiologist,Perfectly still now...
anesthesiologist,Done.  Now could someone please find the open window and fucking close it?
kimberly,This makes no sense. Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake. Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
clear,I don't think so. Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we
thomas,Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
clear,"If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be..."
thomas,"Um, Kimberly? This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down."
kimberly,Don't worry. Nothing can happen to us.
thomas,I wasn't worried about us.
clear,Slow down! We're...
clear, What did you see? What am I looking for?
kimberly,"No, it's not here. This one was different. More like the pile up and the van going into the lake. It wasn't just a sign, I was there."
clear, Another premonition?
kimberly,"Yes. I was in a hospital. There was screaming... A nurse was choking me. I couldn't tell wh at she looked like, but the name tag was right in my face. Kalarjian."
thomas,Kalarjian?
kimberly,I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
nurse,Quite complaining. I got burnt babies in the Children's Ward braver than you.
nurse,"Don't bother. You won't be talking for at least a month. Think you can handle that, Jabberjaw?"
nurse,"Don't worry. Everyone learns to love me once they get used to my sense of humor, okay?"
kimberly,Shouldn't we pull over?
thomas,No time. Keep going. I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
kimberly,Oh come on.
kimberly,What do you want me to do?
clear, Speed up.
kimberly,"Yeah, fuck 'em.  No offense."
clear,"Be alive, Isabella, please be alive."
orderly,"Need a pen? Sure. If you like, I'll bring crosswords for you, too."
anchor man,"Good advice, Sue. And stay in school. Up next, Johnny Showers has the weather..."
orderly,"Jeez, it's freezing in here."
administrator,What are you doing? The Henzels are still waiting for you in the Children's Ward --
orderly,"Right, right, right.     Gregory's big day."
administrator,And Mrs. Dempsey in hydrotherapy can't feel her legs.
clear,Isabella Cruz.    What room's she in?
receptionist,"I'm sorry, I can't give out that info unless you're a relative."
clear,I'm her sister.
receptionist,"I'll have to see your ID, Ms. Cruz."
clear,Delivery rooms are downstairs. I'll find Eugene and catch up with you.
thomas,"Hurry, I think she's this way."
receptionist,Security?
obstetrician,"Listen to me, Isabella, I need you to stop pushing."
isabella,What's wrong? IS the baby all right?
obstetrician,It's a breach. If I can't reverse
steve,Maybe I should step outside.
pa announcement,Code Blue in Delivery Room 6.   Code Blue!
security guard,Just where do you think you're going?
obstetrician,Almost there. I see the head...
nurse,What are you doing in here?    Get the hell out! Right now!
obstetrician,"Isabella, look down and see your son."
clear,A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
thomas,Don't sweat it.   It's over.
clear,She had the baby?
kimberly,New life defeats death. We've done it. Death has to rewrite the list. We're safe.
thomas,Are you okay? You just face planted!
kimberly,I know how it feels to be dead.
clear,What did you see?
kimberly,I was dead. And came back to life. An EEG machine. Where's Eugene?
thomas,"But it's over. Isabella's baby was the key. You saw her die and everything, right?"
kimberly,I don't...what if I made a mistake?
thomas,Impossible. She was on the onramp.
kimberly,I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile -up.
thomas,Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
clear,Can you remember anything about it?
kimberly,...the Same hands from the van.
clear,It's you Kimberly. The premonitions are about you.
kimberly,No!   It can't be.
clear, I have to save Eugene!
clear,Eugene?    Are you in there?
kimberly,Oh no...
orderly," Thanks hon, the Henzels are going crazy for this thing."
kimberly,Nurse Kalarjian...
kimberly,Oh my God. That's it. The lake. The EEG machine. Nurse Kalarjian.
thomas,What?
kimberly,You can't cheat destiny. I know what I have to do to save us. I have to die.
thomas,That's crazy. You can't give up now. We can still fight this thing.
kimberly,I have to do this.
emt,What the fuck?!
nurse,She's back!
thomas,Kimberly?!
kimberly, Welcome back. We did it.           For real.
thomas,I know.   I can feel it too.
kimberly,"My God, this is delicious. I can't believe I used to be a vegan."
thomas,What's wrong with a platonic relationship?
kimberly,"For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad."
thomas," Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment."
thomas,"Well, technically when we died, we gave Death what it wanted. And by the time we were revived, it had already moved on to graver pastures."
kimberly,"Food's great too, Mrs. Gibbons. Big props to you and Brian."
kimberly,Three short glorious weeks away.
brian,"Dad, you had the spatula last, right?"
kimberly,Brian looks like he's having fun.
kimberly,How's that?
