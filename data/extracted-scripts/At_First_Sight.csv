Speaker,Dialogue
amy,"I'm lost Betsy, and you know me - I don't wear lost well - wait, wait I'm losing you...  I'm pulling over before you disappear forever."
amy,Sign? I was looking for a sign? There's no...
amy,"Wait, I got it - yeah. No don't call me.. right, unless you hear from Atlanta. And fax me the designs - I want to tinker with them a bit more ... I'm going to rest - bye - I'll see you in a week."
amy,"Oh p-lease, Whitney."
caroline,"we have a full weight room, lifecycles, stairmasters, a spa, yoga, aerobics, spin classes..."
amy,"I'm really just looking for a quick fix, here. Do you have anything that just involves lying down?"
caroline,A massage.
amy,Great. I'll have one a day. Not too early.
woman's voice,"Virgil, Oh God..., right there. Yes."
woman's voice,"Yes there - a bit more...  --wait - wait, you can't stop - one more minute - noo!"
virgil's voice,"Sorry, Susan - time's up. I've got someone waiting."
susan,"Virgil, you have to come live with me."
virgil's voice,"And what would your husband say? Amy, you out there? - c'mon in."
susan,That's it - I'm getting a divorce.
virgil,"Hey, Amy, I'm Virgil - why don't you get ready - hop up on the table."
amy,Sounds like you're a genius at this.
virgil," That's right.. Mozart, Einstein, Virgil Anderson, massage therapist. Now I'm going to start working somewhat deep - you let me know if you want anything deeper."
amy,"Deeper is good - where I come from, all you get is shallow."
virgil,I like that - deep it is.
virgil,First time in Pinecrest?
amy,Came in late last night.. missed the town completely.
virgil,"If you came in broad daylight, you could still miss the town completely."
virgil,Too much compute? work.
amy,Uh-huh.
virgil,Bad chair - you should think about a change.
amy, Absolutely.
virgil,Too deep?
amy,No.. ..... just right.
virgil,I - I'm sorry - it was too deep...
amy,"No - it.. It's not you.. It's just things have kinda built up, I don't know why I'm crying.. look, this is embarrassing..."
amy,"Yeah, thanks. You always make the girls cry."
virgil,Not since grade school. I'm going to go now - unless you'd like me to stay.
amy,Could you - just for a minute?
virgil,"Of course, whatever you need."
amy,You ever feel like a Martian's invaded your entire body?
virgil,Every day.
amy,Virgil?
amy,Virgil - wait...
amy,"Virgil, hey."
virgil,Yes.
amy,It's Amy - Amy Tremont.
virgil,"Of course - you were sleeping, didn't want to wake you."
amy,"Yes thanks - you're the skater, right - I saw you last night, coming in. Pretty mean slapshot. You play on some team or something?"
virgil,"Yeah, something. You a hockey fan?"
amy,Always liked it - never get around to seeing a game. But I loved to skate as a kid - unfortunately I have two left feet.
virgil, They look perfectly OK with me.
amy,I love the view you get here.
virgil,Same here - I never get used to it.
virgil,"Well, this is my ride. Hey Tommy, my man."
tommy,Virge.
amy,"Well, I just wanted to apologize for back there - blubbering like that - I was just in a weird place."
virgil,And now...
amy,"Now, I'm fine - so I wanted to thank- you. For what you did."
virgil,For making you cry.
amy,"No, I made me cry - and you handled it great - didn't freak or anything.  Is my mascara smeared or something?"
virgil, No. Why?
amy,You're just looking at me funny.
carl,Virgil - lets move it.
virgil,As I said earlier - I just never get used to the view.
virgil,See you tomorrow.
amy,See you... oh my God.
virgil,What?
amy,"You're, you're -- I'm so sorry."
virgil," Hey, you already apologized once - no need to overdo it. Bye now."
virgil,"Get of f the couch, Sophie."
virgil,Some seeing eye dog - more like sleeping eye dog.
virgil,Met a girl today - nice voice - followed me out of the building.
virgil,No she wasn't a stalker.
virgil,"Hey, you're here - so how are the kids today?"
jennie,The usual - need a lot of attention. So who's the girl?
virgil,From the spa. I made her cry.
jennie,You haven't done that since--
virgil, That's what I told her. Coke?
jennie,I'm fine. Your dinner's ready - chicken's at 3 o'clock - rice is at...
virgil,"6 o'clock, peas at 9 o'clock"
jennie, One day I'm going to switch them on you.
virgil,And one day I'll play forward for the New York Rangers.
virgil,Or a new sister.
jennie,I'd work on the jokes.
virgil,You want to watch some hockey?
jennie, I'll be next door you need me.
virgil,"You know this girl - for one moment - she actually thought I could  Wonder what she thinks about ""blind dates."""
amy,DAMMIT!
amy,Coming!
amy,Virgil..?
virgil,My turn to apologize. I should have told you I was blind it wasn't fair.
amy,That's OK. You want to come in - I just got out of the shower - give me a minute to get changed?
virgil," Sure, I promise I won't look."
virgil,"Anyways, I was in the neighborhood -- actually the whole town's my neighborhood -- and since you've never been to our illustrious village, I thought maybe we could go into town - see what we see."
amy,See what we see?
virgil,Figure of speech .
amy,"You mean right now, tonight?"
virgil,Great - I'm blind and you're deaf - what a pair.
virgil,"... the Mechanic at the top of the street is Doug - smokes too much - but a good guy. Three steps down is Carlson's hardware - he's got a laugh like a donkey - we sometimes listen to games together - he's a Devil's fan. And just up ahead should be Grady's junk shop - he calls it ""antiques""... Smells like junk. I'd hate to see what it looks like ."
virgil, Hey Nancy.
nancy,Hey Virgil - got that book in for you.
virgil,"Nancy's our librarian, brings in any braille book I want."
nancy, The guy's nuts about the pyramids - anything he can get his hands on...
virgil,Thank-you Nancy - you should get your groceries home - your ice cream's melting.
amy,Nice place - you seem to know everyone here.
virgil,Moved here when I was eight. My family figured it would be a good place for me to grow up. Tell me what you see.
amy,"Well, there's a good structure to the town - genuine lines, good use of space. To be honest I'd find a better balance to a lot of these buildings. But that's me."
virgil,What's you?
amy,"The architect in me - can't leave well enough alone. Art school in college - I made the arms for the Venus DeMilo.  see, the Venus De Milo has no arms and..."
virgil," I know the Venus De Milo has no arms, and the Mona Lisa has this captivating smile and David doesn't wear a fig leaf."
amy,How do you...
virgil,"I may not have been a lot of places - but I read about things, then make an image up here --  --that works for me."
virgil,This is the end of the street. We should turn back.
amy,What about past the end of the street? What's out there?
virgil, Nothing.
amy,No - there's an old run down building off to the side...
virgil,Must be the old firehouse. It had a fire so they shut it down.  What else do you see?
amy,A wall of shrubs - a field with an interesting configuration of trees.
virgil,Tell me how you see it.
amy," OK, sure. Let's see - long and elegant. Like -- like a woman dancing with two lovers, trying to decide which one she loves."
amy,What?
virgil,"It's just - the image you just gave me - ""Dancing trees. - I like that."
virgil,We should go - it's starting to rain.
amy, There's a bit of a breeze but--
amy,I can't believe how fast it happens...
amy,Virgil?
virgil,You like rain - I love the rain.
amy, What were you just doing there?
virgil,"Listening - the rain - it brings out the contours of everything, gives life to a room I can't see."
amy,Looks like it's...
virgil,"No, listen for it - not what it looks like - what it becomes. Come here."
virgil,Now just listen to it - shut out everything but that sound - do you hear it?
amy,Yes - there - it's soft - like a shimmer
virgil,The wind blowing the rain against a window.
amy," Like a cymbal. It's like our own percussive symphony, isn't it?"
virgil,"The world is invisible to me - with my touch it comes alive. But only one thing at a time. But when it's raining, I feel everything at once. Sometimes, I wish it could rain inside rain all around us."
amy," ""Einfuehlung."""
virgil,What?
amy,Einfuehlung - it's an architectural term. It means to share an empathy. Been a long time since I felt that.
amy,"No, I'm fine, really. It was just something passing through me - can't explain it - a good thing."
amy,What you just showed me  how I feel - makes me smile.
virgil,I see it now. Thank-you.
amy,"You kidding? today, I'm looking for a complete nervous breakdown."
virgil,I love a challenge.
amy,Can I ask how long you've been blind?
virgil,"Of course, most people avoid the subject. You tell them you're blind and they act surprised. ""You're blind? Reallv? I didn't know - you hide it so well."" And then they wave their hand in front of your face just to make sure.  It started when I was a little over a year old."
amy, You see shadows?
virgil,No. Congenital cataracts. And a case of retinitis pigmentosa thrown in for good measure. This area needs to loosen up.
amy,"I think you're doing it.  No bright lights, nothing?"
virgil,"I'm blind as a bat. Actually, blinder 'cause they emit sonar all the time. I don't have a sixth sense, I just don't have the fifth one. I can't hear things in Vermont, can't smell if you're mad at me, and, no - I don't know Helen Keller, Ray Charles or Stevie Wonder."
virgil,You say something?
amy,"No, I just - this feels nice - too nice."
amy,You're very good.. at what you do.
virgil,Thank-you.
amy,You enjoy it.
virgil,At times. Some clients make it more enjoyable than others.
amy,And this client...
virgil,"Is very, very..."
amy,What?
virgil,Sorry - it's time. I've got Mr. Ketchum coming in next - all two hundred pounds. Sorry - I felt like we were just getting started.
amy,Thank-you. For last night as well - love to do it again.
virgil,"How about I cook dinner then, tonight."
amy,I'd like that.
caroline,Amy
amy,Virgil - it's Amy. I - I can't make dinner - I'm really sorry - an emergency came up - they're dragging me back to New York.
virgil,Oh. Yeah. Anything serious?
amy,The project we were working on was rejected - could go down the drain. I'll deal with it quick - I'd like to come back.
virgil,Yeah. Good. Well. I'll be here.
virgil,-DAMN IT!!!
virgil,Shit - that was stupid.
duncan,Absolutely Mr. Falk - something lj missing - we realize that now. We just need some time to figure out what.
duncan," And budget. Yes sir. Don't worry, we won't let you down."
duncan,"Don't say it, I know. You were never happy with the design."
duncan,"But you'd have tinkered with it till the job went away. So now we've got him hooked, you've got your second chance."
amy,"Look at these site photos - see those trees - we were going to get rid of them - let's incorporate them into the design use what's natural about the location.  And by the way - the 53rd St. lobby - coming back from Pinecrest, I came up with a new addition - add some life to that place."
amy,"What? I can't have a couple of ideas.  Fine, you want to know - I met a guy.  Betsy stands.  BETSY Too modern for me."
amy,"So much for the ""we're all friends here"" idea."
betsy,I hate to admit it but I agree with Duncan on this one. AMY  Don't shoot. BETSY He makes sense sometimes. My father had a problem a few years back with severe cataracts. Do you have any idea what you're getting into?
amy," I need more than that, Betsy. For once in a long, long time I feel like I can breathe again. Just the way he touches me I know I found someone I can connect with."
virgil, Hockey stick. Here.
amy, This is tough.
virgil,"Jen, this is Amy Tremont."
jennie,"I was just at the market Virgil, picking up a few things before school - and I thought you might like some..."
virgil,It was my fault. I'm OK.
virgil," Goddamit, Jennie - I said I was OK - leave me alone!"
amy,"Virgil, I just got some great news."
amy,"No, no - I was talking to my assistant this morning - her father had these severe cataracts..."
amy,She put me in touch with a Dr. Richard Aaron - the guy's the leading eye surgeon on the eastern seaboard - he's been working with techniques - I don't know all the jargon - but I spoke to him earlier on the phone at the Institute...
virgil,No problem. That's the whole point here Amy - there is no goddamned problem.
amy,"I'm sorry. Told you - can't leave well enough alone. I - I guess I should get back, start to pack... VIRGIL Rushing into trees again?"
amy,No - what?
virgil,C'mere.
virgil,The other night - when we were dancing - being with you - I felt different - special - I don't know - whole.
aaron,Good news in that I should be able to remove them with little or no damage to your cornea.
amy,"Well, if the super catches you playing ball in the hall, he'll have a coronary."
amy,"Got it - here take my arm.  Couch, chair, TV to the left, low table at.. .at 4 o'clock, has the phone on it..."
amy,It's not done yet - one day I'll finish it.
amy,Alright. A movie. I won't be long.
amy,You. Me. Everyone is staring at us.
amy, You mean it. I mean I only want you to have the operation...
jennie,How're you feeling?
virgil,"OK - a little pain, like a tequila hang over - is Amy here?"
virgil," Okay - wait. So - so - what do I do? I mean, what will I see first?"
aaron,"Well - we're all here - Amy, your sister. This is new for us all. Why don't we find out?"
jennie,It's not fine - don't say it's fine.
amy,"Virgil, it's just the camera."
jennie,He's thirsty - someone get him a drink!!
virgil,No - just a can - a bottle -- put something in my hands!
amy,What just happened in there?
aaron,He sees you. He just doesn't understand that he sees you.
jennie,You didn't think of this?
amy,So what are we supposed to do now - you saw him - it's like he's another person in there.
aaron,He won't need to stay here - take him home - let him rest. But I will need to see him every couple of days for the next month.
jennie,But I can't stay here - and you can't do this alone--who's going to take care.. .?
virgil,I'm not blind anymore - and I'm not going to let someone I care about walk out of my life again.
jennie, It's not your fault he left. You can't keep blaming yourself.
virgil,"God, I feel like... like such a child - I just thought seeing would be different."
amy,No - no. This is your first seeing day.  I want you to see everything.
webster,"What? - I'm Anne Bancroft all of a sudden? I'm a professor - I teach people, how to teach the blind how to become independent.  There's no book on what you're going through - I'd like to help - but like the rest of things in life - it's up to you."
virgil,Wait a minute - up to me? I thought you were going to help me here.
virgil,That's all it is right now - one big trick. Nothing makes any sense. I can't function like this.
webster, -- we've got to look as well.
virgil,Amy. Let's go.
amy,Blue.
virgil,"Blue. OK, good - that's a mailbox - it's blue. There - we've started."
amy,Fine. Let's walk.
virgil,"Jennie?! Jennie.. God, I'm sorry - c'mon in - this is my friend Ethan - what are you doing here?"
virgil,No. I - I don't want to see him. My eyes aren't good enough - not yet - he won't understand. It won't be enough.
amy,Look - about this party tonight - it's no big deal - maybe we should just...
virgil,"It's your partner's birthday. We should go - besides you wanted me to meet your friends, right?"
betsy,"You know my father was blind for several years, he had cataracts as well."
kevin,I'll get you a drink.
amy, Aw - no - I really...
virgil,What I want is to make it work with Amy.
amy,Not so bad. DUNCAN It's nice to dance together again.
virgil,Wait - no - this isn't your fault - I'm the one's been a shit. You're too hard on yourself - expect too much of yourself.
