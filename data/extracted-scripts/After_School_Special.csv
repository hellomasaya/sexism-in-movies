Speaker,Dialogue
biology teacher,"                        13 RACHAEL UNGER, Deacon's girlfriend at the time, is naked under Deacon's sheets after school one day. Deacon ENTERS from the bathroom and is immediately surprised by her state of undress. DEACON Rachael! What are you doing? She sits up and strikes a sexy pose. RACHAEL We've been together for a year now, and I thought it was time to take our relationship to the next level. Deacon is becoming very nervous."
deacon,"Now? RACHAEL You've been talking about this for months. DEACON I didn't think you were listening to me. Suddenly, Rachael becomes a little self-conscious. RACHAEL Don't you want to? DEACON Of course I do. But, I, um... I don't have anything... She pulls out a condom. RACHAEL I do. But he's still hesitating. RACHAEL  ""I have a math test tomorrow."" The bottom line is, I just couldn't do it. I don't know why, I just couldn't. And I've cursed myself every day since then. Deacon is suddenly... 15   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                   15 ... very depressed as he trudges to his locker. Which is nothing compared to how he feels when he looks"
fred,"It doesn't get any better than that. You and Rachael were perfect for each other. And naked girls don't just appear out of thin air.  ""First you get the money, then you get the power, then you get the women."" FRED So, we're going to become Cuban drug lords?"
deacon,"Listen, the porno pirating operation is bringing in plenty of money. When I get my new car tonight for my birthday, we'll have the power to go wherever we want. Then, there's nothing stopping us from getting the girls. Fred and Matt look at Deacon warily. Is this a plan? Then, the hot girls and Jake drive past the guys. JAKE Bye, Sphincter! They laugh, then peel out with the radio blasting. FRED Nothing's going to change, Deacon. You're still going to be the kid who shit his pants in fifth grade and no one will ever let you forget it. DEACON I had a stomach virus, asshole. Just then, a super hot CHEERLEADER drops her car keys and bends over to pick them up. FRED Oh, that's just not fair. Fred adjusts himself."
russ,Gotcha! Fred SCREAMS. RUSS  What's this for? ...and a Barbie-type DOLL with a pullstring. Russ pulls it. DOLL I'm Candy. Let's play dress-up. The crowd is now seriously disturbed. MARK Dude.
deacon,"Yeah. MATT Really? DEACON Really. I was. ROGER Happy birthday, Deacon. It's Lois Lane #2. Be careful. It's still in the wrapper. He hands Deacon a comic book, still in the plastic bag. DEACON Thanks. 23   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - LATER                                       23 Half-eaten cake and ice cream, unwrapped presents. Matt videotapes the event. MR. LEWIS Are you ready for the big present? DEACON                    24 The door opens, the lights come on, and Deacon's face drops. No new car. Instead, several large wrapped boxes. Deacon halfheartedly rips open the paper. MR. LEWIS It's a new computer system. You've been talking about it for months. But his Mom can see his expression. MRS. LEWIS What? That's not what you wanted? DEACON No, it is. It's just--"
max,"I'll take it. MRS. LEWIS Max! MR. LEWIS We can exchange it if it's not the right one. DEACON No, I just thought-- I thought you guys were buying me that car I wanted. Max snickers. MRS. LEWIS A car? Why do you need a car? MR. LEWIS You can ask permission to use our car whenever you want, champ. They put their arms around Deacon and smile warmly. Deacon looks over at his parents' Aerostar Minivan. Everyone moves back into the house, except Deacon's parents, who linger. MR. LEWIS  What? DEACON You invited more people?"
fred,"Well, we did send out flyers to like three hundred people from school. DEACON And no one showed up? ROGER I did. Deacon looks back at Roger. DEACON Great. ROGER Uh, guys. No one showed up because they're all at Tom Cooperman's house. He's having a keg party. FRED What? Why didn't I hear about this? That shit's not right. ROGER I heard it from Rahim. He beamed me the 411 in study hall. A beat. Deacon's anger turns to action. DEACON Let's go. MATT Why? FRED Yeah. Tom Cooperman kicked me in the balls in third grade, and I swear there is still a footprint on my nutsack. DEACON Come on, guys. Can I just get one thing that I ask for on my goddamn birthday? MATT He's got a point. FRED Fine. Watch your balls."
deacon," I'm gonna go talk to her. What have I got to lose? FRED Your dignity? DEACON She's Rachael's friend. It's not like I don't know her. MATT Ask her if she has any unusual hats. Girls like that. Deacon gives Matt a dirty look. THE KEG AREA DEACON Hey, Naomi. NAOMI Happy Birthday, Deacon."
deacon," What an asshole. As soon as Jake is out of sight, Deacon turns back to Naomi, but she's already gone, stranding Deacon. What just happened here? REVEAL Matt helping Roger drink a beer in the background."
deacon,"looks at her, thinks it over, and finally... slips off his shorts. He gets into the pool in his underwear, then slips them off, too, and throws them on the side of pool. DEACON Wow. This feels amazing. Someone splashes Kelly, she giggles, and the other kids swim around. Kelly swims by Deacon seductively and he smiles. JAKE  Oh my God! Skid marks. Aaaahhh, Deacon shit his pants again! DEACON No, I didn't! Give them back! Jake does a victory lap around the pool with Deacon's underwear on the stick. Everybody is laughing. JAKE Sphincter boy shit his pants!"
matt,"What? FRED I got fired yesterday. Russ caught me and went berserk. Some sort of sting operation he's been planning for months. I don't know. DEACON You're kidding me, right? Tell me you're kidding. FRED No. And now I have to work twice a week at my dad's office. I told you this Scarface plan was stupid. DEACON Great. So now we've got no girls, no car, and no money. FRED And no porn. MATT Tony Montana would be very disappointed. Deacon is once again... 31   INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY                                           31 ... very depressed, as he sits, bored out of his mind in his biology class. BIOLOGY TEACHER Now turn your textbooks to chapter six, the Animal Kingdom. As you should know by now, biology is the study of life, in all its infinite varieties. Deacon continues to stare at her perpetually hard nipples. BIOLOGY TEACHER  So to keep things a little fun around here, tomorrow we're taking a field trip to the zoo. Deacon buries his head in his hands. 32   EXT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY                  32 Deacon is talking to the Dorky Freshman near the bike rack."
dorky freshman,"Is this some kind of extortion racket? I'll pay you double if you can get me something today. DEACON I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do for a while. We don't have anything new. DORKY FRESHMAN I'm dying. I just need something. Just then, Naomi walks by on her way to the parking lot. DEACON Hey, Naomi. What are you up to? NAOMI Going home to cram for midterms. With a look, Deacon shoos away the freshman dork. DEACON Oh. I could help you. I mean, if you needed any help. NAOMI That's okay. I'll be all right. Deacon searches for something meaningful to say, desperate not to let the moment pass him by. Naomi cuts him some slack by asking, NAOMI  Hey, sphincter. ... just as Jake drives up to them. Deacon is starting to really get pissed at Jake ruining the moment with Naomi. DEACON Look, can you please stop calling me that? I think we're old enough to just let it go. All right?"
jake,"Oh, sure. Sorry about that... Shit-pants. He looks at Naomi. JAKE  Look, mom. I need a car. MRS. LEWIS But I thought we agreed-- DEACON I need a car of my own. MRS. LEWIS Well, honey. A car is a lot of responsibility. DEACON Jesus, Mom. I'm seventeen now. I think I can handle it. MRS. LEWIS Well, it's also a lot of money. I'll tell you what. Maybe you can get an after school job to earn money for a car. I'll talk to your father. Deacon is stewing."
biology teacher," Well, Roger actually... 37   INT. FRED'S BEDROOM - DAY                                       37 FRED What? DEACON Let's make one. MATT One what? DEACON A movie. MATT Great! That's perfect! I've already got an idea for a kind of sci-fi horror thing. It's like ""The Shining"" meets ""The Jetsons."" DEACON No, you moron. A porno film. Fred lights up. FRED Even better. DEACON And check this out. The best part of all, is I've got an angle."
fred,"What kind of angle? DEACON We can make pornos that cater to guys like us. FRED You mean virgins. DEACON Yes. Adult films made by virgins for virgins. MATT With good cinematography. FRED And cute, nice girls. The kind you'd want to take to dinner with your parents. DEACON Right. No shots of sweaty guys' faces. FRED And nothing up the butt. They look at him. FRED  What? I don't like it when they put stuff up their butt. MATT These have to be nicely edited. We should shoot on super 16 and transfer to video. DEACON No, Matt. We'll shoot it on your video camera. We're not getting any expensive equipment. FRED How are we going to get the women to star in the film? MATT And the guys. DEACON I don't know. We'll surf the net. We'll figure it out. They look at each other for a beat. Finally, Fred and Matt crack up."
fred,"Okay. Sure. I've thought about it. I've thought about shaving Principal Taggert's ass, too. A look, then Deacon gets up to seal the deal. DEACON Look. This is an opportunity we shouldn't let slip away. If we make this movie, it could be the best year of our lives. We'll go in boys and come out men. And at the end, we'll have the money, the power, and the women. But you losers would rather play it safe. Well, I'm not going to waste another minute. I'm making this porno movie with or without you. And when I show up at school in my new set of wheels, and you two limp dicks are begging me for my sloppy seconds, I'll just have to tell you, ""Sorry, guys. That ship has sailed. You blew it."" Ringing silence. MATT  That was a really good speech, Deacon. DEACON Thanks. MATT Did you work that out before? DEACON No, Matt. FRED Okay... So say we were to do this. What would we call our company? MATT I've got it. ""After School Special."" They look at him. It's perfect. 38   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY                                      38 WE FOLLOW a WOMAN dressed in a Fredericks of Hollywood type outfit, walking down the hallway past office suites; a mortgage company, a dentist, etc... She enters an office. As the door closes behind her, WE SEE the sign on the door, ""Ramalot Productions."""
fred,"Okay. In a minute. Fred puts the samples down. She rolls her eyes then leaves. FRED  rectal exam. Have a seat. He leaves and Fred looks at Deacon, mischievously. DEACON No way. FRED Why not? It's perfect. My dad's got Mr. Greitzer's signature on file, his credit card number, and his social security number... A beat. DEACON And he'll never find out? FRED It's not like we're going to send him our annual report. It'll just be like an official name of record or something. DEACON Okay. Cool. The Nurse returns."
nurse,"And take these fecal and semen samples, too. She hands Fred two more containers, and the guys exit. 41A   EXT. STREET - DAY                                                41A The guys ride their bikes towards the lab to deliver the samples. FRED And we need porno names. DEACON What do you mean? FRED It's a basic rule of porno. All people affiliated with the production of an adult film have porno names so their friends don't recognize them. MATT Oh, you mean like ""Johnny Hardmember""? FRED Exactly. That's a good one. I'll be Balls McLongcock. MATT Ooh, I like it. DEACON Guys. Those kind of names are just for the actors. MATT You're just jealous that you don't have a cool porno name like us. DEACON Okay, fine. Then I'm Sam ...  Slam. Sam Slam. The Back Door Man. Matt and Fred look at each other, then Deacon. MATT That name sucks. FRED You don't get it, do you? A porno name needs to be a very subtle thing. Fred gestures and DROPS the samples which SPLATTER all over the ground."
deacon,"Sorry, Balls. I guess I'm still new at this. FRED Matt, pick that up. 42   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                              42 The family dinner. MR. LEWIS And I'm telling the guy, he's got to use form ND-45 for a third-party beneficiary, but Johnson's gotta be the big man. ""We've been using ND-90 for twenty-two years."" But Johnson's an idiot. He doesn't know ND-90 doesn't even exist anymore. Mom yawns. The phone rings and she gets it. MRS. LEWIS Hello?  I'm tutoring someone ... in math. To earn money for a car. He forces a smile. 43   INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - DAY                                        43 The guys are busy setting up auditions. DEACON No, we don't pay bus fare. JUMP CUT TO:"
fred,"Sure, you can bring your dog.  You can go in now. She gets up and walks through the curtain."
deacon,"But, mom. You said I could use the car, but it's never free. MRS. LEWIS All right, Deacon. I'll walk to the store. MAX Where are you guys going? DEACON Out. MR. LEWIS Why are you boys dressed like Don Ho? FRED This is the new style, Mr. Lewis. MAX Yeah, for ass-wranglers. MRS. LEWIS Max! 49    INT. AEROSTAR - NIGHT                                               49 Inside the car  Oh, yeah. They pull out and drive off. 49A   EXT. CLEVELAND - NIGHT                                             49A The minivan descends out of the suburbs into the lights of the big city below. 50    EXT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - NIGHT                                  50 CLOSE ON the Aerostar's bumper sticker: ""My child is on the honor roll at William Wall High School."""
deacon,"We're on business, he's on vacation. He hands the i.d.'s back. BOUNCER Well, ""tiki-alohi-noa-lohi."" DEACON Sorry? BOUNCER That's Hawaiian for ""welcome."" FRED Right. Of course. We just moved to Hawaii a few months ago. Haven't picked up the local lingo yet. They force smiles and wait for the answer... BOUNCER Okay. Have a good time, guys. Deacon grabs the i.d.'s and pushes the other two forward. He grabs the handle to the door. BOUNCER  Nice lamination job. FRED Thanks! The Bouncer closes the door on them. Busted."
deacon,"Look. We have to get into this strip bar. MATT The next two years of high school depend on it. BOUNCER How old are you guys? DEACON Twenty-seven. FRED Thirty-five. MATT Sixteen. Fred smacks him. BOUNCER Sorry, guys. Then, DEACON We've got money. Deacon pulls out a wad of cash. The Bouncer looks around, then thinks about it for a second. 51   INT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - NIGHT                                51 WE TRACK the guys as they slowly move down the dark corridor towards the light. Each guy is in his own little world, Matt and Fred following Deacon as he takes the first nervous steps. First the neon lights hit them, then the smell of liquor and sweat, the sounds of barroom chatter, and finally the grinding blast of MUSIC, so powerful it seems to stop them in their tracks. Their eyes bug out. SCANTILY-CLAD WAITRESS walking by. As they move further into the club, they see actual STRIPPERS soliciting lap dances and some TOPLESS DANCERS onstage. Fred smiles ear to ear. The guys are locked in a deep primordial trance, broken only by the voice of a COCKTAIL WAITRESS. COCKTAIL WAITRESS What'll you boys have? Two drink minimum. FRED Huh? Oh. I'll have a scotch. Straight up. On the rocks."
mike,"Vacation? There's the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Vic thinks it over. VIC That's true. Vic regains his train of thought. VIC  What is this? ""F"" with Vic month? If any more amateurs start moving in on my territory, I'm going to get really mad. Vic opens the drawer and pulls out a GUN. He cocks it menacingly. MIKE Who you gonna shoot? Vic's bluff has been called. Reluctantly, VIC I don't know. MIKE Calm down, Vic. I don't need you all agitated. You still got five films to star in today. VIC You're right, Mikey. Mike takes the gun from Vic and puts it away. MIKE Don't worry. I'll find these guys and take care of it. Vic cheers up a bit. VIC You hungry? MIKE Yeah, I could eat. VIC Grab some lunch? MIKE Yeah, okay. The two head out for lunch, leaving the bondage lady sitting there, confused."
matt,"A stripper. Her name's Ashley. He pulls out Ashley's picture from his manila folder. Jake checks it out. His eyes go wide and suddenly he's their new best friend. JAKE Who's the guy? A beat. JAKE  Well, maybe I could do it. DEACON No, that's not a good idea. JAKE Why not? FRED It's a lot harder than it looks. JAKE You don't think I can do it? Trust me, I've nailed enough girls. DEACON Forget it. JAKE Look, you little butt munch. I want to do this, and if you don't let me, I'll go and tell your mommy what kind of sick shit you're doing. Jake looks him over. 54   INT. BASEMENT SET AS ""YEARBOOK OFFICE"" - DAY                    54 DARKNESS. Click. The lights come on. The big day has come at last. The guys are nervously conferring on one side of the room, far away from Ashley, who's standing alone, dressed in a conservative high school girl's outfit. The basement has been transformed into the guys' idea of a movie set, complete with lights, camera, tripod, and sound equipment. A desk and decoration make the room look roughly like the high school yearbook offices. Deacon gives Matt a little shove, and Matt takes a long walk over to Ashley."
matt,"So, um, I'll be directing. ASHLEY Okay. MATT Okay. So I want you to play this very understated. It's a very visceral scene, so it's important not to play it too over the top. ASHLEY Uh huh.  Hey, did you guys shave or something? Deacon looks at the other two, all three now beardless. DEACON Okay. I think we're ready here. Fred awkwardly picks up the boom and puts his earphones on. MATT Boom in position. FRED What? Deacon pushes him over to position. MATT Ashley, get into position. Matt gets behind the camera. They whisper conspiratorially. One last reality check before they take the leap. FRED Are we actually going to do this? They look over at Ashley. She's waiting. DEACON I guess so. They return to position. MATT So, um, we're starting with the masturbation and then Phillip, the yearbook editor, is going to surprise you. ASHLEY Okay."
matt,"And ... action. ASHLEY  I hope no one catches me because I forgot to lock the door. Oh, yeah. Oh, God, yeah. FRED's smile turns into nervous ogling. DEACON crosses his legs and adjusts his shorts. MATT wipes a bead of sweat from his brow. Deacon whispers, DEACON Close up. MATT What? DEACON Close up. MATT Oh yeah. Right. And Matt zooms in. Ashley continues moaning and as Matt gets closer, the camera starts shaking. He can't keep his hands steady. 54A   THROUGH MATT'S VIDEO DISPLAY                                       54A We'd love to get a look, but the camera is shaking so much, it's just a BLUR."
matt,"And ACTION! But Jake is still standing there, not in the shot. He's starting to sweat. MATT  Action, Jake. JAKE Okay. Still nothing. DEACON Come on, Jake. We're filming. JAKE All right. Hang on a second. He has his back to them, but it's obvious his bread hasn't risen. Fred lets the boom mike sag a bit. FRED My arm's getting tired. ASHLEY So's his. MATT Action... Jake finally whips off his underwear and faces Ashley. ASHLEY That's it? JAKE Hey, it's not hard yet. ASHLEY I can see that. Fred snickers and Jake gives him the evil eye. DEACON Um, okay. Ashley, maybe you can help him out. She grabs his joint and Jake freezes. He remains motionless, focusing every ounce of mental control on keeping the floodgates closed. Approximately one point three seconds later... ASHLEY Aaaahhhh!"
matt,"Wait! I'm not set up for that shot! FRED Can I put down the boom? DEACON Jake? What's happened? Jake, humiliated, runs to put on his shorts. JAKE This has never happened before. She got me too excited. ASHLEY Me? How did you ... without even getting hard first? JAKE  What do you want to hear? I've got a tiny pee-pee? I'm a premature e-jac-u-la-tor? Sometimes before I get a boner? Okay? DEACON Calm down, Jake. We can shoot this scene again. Just relax. We can splice it together. MATT We'd have to do it like twenty times to get enough footage. JAKE I'm out of here. And if you dickwads tell anybody about this, first I'll kill you, and then I'll bust you guys. He pops the videotape out of the camera, takes it, and leaves. ASHLEY Now what? The guys regroup, away from Ashley. The moment of truth: How far are they willing to go? MATT Deacon. You do it. DEACON No way. MATT Come on. This is your big chance."
deacon,"No. You do it. A beat. MATT Fred. FRED What? MATT Come on. FRED You. MATT I have to run the camera. FRED Oh, like you're the only one who can do that. MATT  Look, guys. Maybe we should just pay Ashley and chalk this up to a failed experiment. MATT Fine with me. DEACON No. We can get someone else."
fred,"Who? CUT TO: 55   INT. JIM'S TINY MART - NIGHT                                       55 CLOSE ON the cover of ""T&A Enthusiast"" magazine. RISE UP to reveal a twenty-something MAN thumbing through the issue. REVEAL Deacon, standing a little too close to him. DEACON  Where are you going, man? The guy is out the door. Deacon... 56   EXT. JIM'S TINY MART - NIGHT                                       56 ... runs after him. DEACON Don't you want to get it on with a sexy lady?!? Matt and Fred are sitting on the curb with some slurpies, bummed. MATT And that guy had real screen presence, too. Just then, Coop pulls up in his van and gets out. COOP Hey, dudes. The guys look at each other... JUMP CUT TO: Moments later, after it's all been explained to Coop."
matt,"Deacon, come quick. Deacon steps away from his class for a moment. DEACON Matt, what's wrong? BIOLOGY TEACHER  Like all mammals, the whale gives birth to live young. Can anyone name another characteristic of mammals? Vinnie? FRED Our site got linked by another bigger site. Someone must have seen our stories and liked them. DEACON And? MATT We got a few more pre-orders and a ton of hits. DEACON How many? MATT Guess. DEACON A thousand? FRED Twelve thousand. DEACON Holy shit! Deacon high-fives the other two. They're all stoked. FRED We need to hurry up and make this movie. MATT We should go over the schedule for tomorrow. And make sure the script is ready. Deacon's smile fades. DEACON Uh, I can't tonight guys. FRED Why? Where are you going?"
deacon,"It's this thing I have to go to. MATT Is it a travelling carnival? DEACON No. Look, it's this party Naomi invited me to. MATT Can we come? Fred picks up on Deacon's hesitation. This isn't good. DEACON Uh... Okay. I guess that's cool. An awkward beat. DEACON  What are you wearing to the party? FRED We're not really going to the party, you moron. MATT Why not? FRED Because I said so. Matt starts getting agitated."
matt,"But we told Deacon-- I mean, we can't just not show up. What if Deacon is looking for us-- This is too complicated to explain to Matt, so Fred just gives in. FRED All right. All right. Stop crying already. We'll make an appearance. MATT Cool. 66   INT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                        66 Amid this raging party, Deacon has taken his rightful place with the in-crowd, standing dangerously close to Naomi without his usual sidekicks weighing him down. Finally. NAOMI You know, Rachael's coming back from Paris in a couple of weeks. DEACON So? NAOMI So, aren't you even a little interested in seeing her? DEACON No. There's someone else I'd rather see... He looks into her eyes, waiting to see if the limb he's out on is going to break. She smiles. It's working. Just then, MATT Hey, guys. It's his sidekicks and they've got some seriously bad timing. Deacon shoots them an annoyed look. NAOMI So what's this project you guys are working on? FRED We can't really talk about it. JAKE  Yeah. It's private. Jake eyes Deacon intently."
deacon,"I've been wanting to do that for a long time. NAOMI So why didn't you? Most guys would look away at this point, with a fabulous babe with pouty lips staring you down. But Deacon passes the test: he stands his ground and kisses her again. She likes it. AT A WINDOW, Jake sees them kissing. He doesn't like it. AT ANOTHER WINDOW, Fred sees it, too. And for a completely different reason, he doesn't like it either. 68   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                            68 The set is finally ready: Ashley is lying on the bed in a robe, the lights and camera are set, and Matt and Fred are adjusting the video camera. The only thing missing is an actor. Deacon ENTERS. DEACON Hey, where's Coop? FRED He was supposed to be here a half hour ago. MATT Maybe he got sucked into a black hole. He chuckles to himself. DEACON Good one, Spock. I can't understand why you're not more popular with the ladies. MATT Look, we're wasting time. Deacon, why don't you just go in there? Deacon balks at first, then looks over at Ashley, lying there. MATT  Come on... DEACON Okay. Okay. All right already. He pulls off his shirt and approaches Ashley with a pizza box from out of nowhere. MATT And action!"
matt,"Hey, quit the chatter. FRED Sorry. MATT Hey, why don't you guys kiss? DEACON What? MATT You know. Make out with each other. DEACON What? FRED All right. Fred goes in to kiss Deacon, who's thoroughly confused. Deacon holds him back with his hand. DEACON Wait. Why do you want us to kiss? MATT  Because that's what guys do in gay porn. DEACON What? Deacon looks over at the camera. It's Ashley filming. PANIC! He slowly looks down at the person he and Fred are having sex with. He can barely look. It's Matt! MATT More sausage please. DEACON Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh! CUT TO: 69   INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                   69 Deacon bolts up out of bed. Nightmare. Thank God. 70   INT. BASEMENT SET AS ""MOVIE THEATER"" - DAY                      70 Deacon enters and the scene looks very much like the dream: Ashley on the bed and Matt and Fred waiting around."
matt,"Action. Matt starts his cheesy ""projector light effect"" and Coop takes a seat next to Ashley. ASHLEY This summer tent-pole event-movie is making me so scared. COOP Hide your head down here and I'll tell you when it's safe to come up. As she starts to go down, we turn our attention... ON FRED and DEACON, away from the action. FRED  Oh, baby. Not yet. Fred appears to be pondering the question deeply. His face slowly contorts to a look of seeming anguish. Then, FRED Fire! The coiled cord to the massive light is burning a circular hole in the smouldering carpet. COOP Unplug the light! Deacon moves to unplug it."
matt,"Wait, it's hot! Too late. Deacon touches the cord, SCREAMS, and reels back, knocking the light over. It EXPLODES onto the floor. The carpet bursts into FLAMES. FRED Run! Ashley and Coop run up the stairs. Fred isn't far behind. MATT Quick, get the fire extinguisher! DEACON Where is it? MATT Over there! He spots it in the corner and grabs it. Meanwhile the flames are growing. Deacon comes over and aims the extinguisher at the flames. He depresses the lever. Nothing. DEACON It's not working! Matt thinks about it for a second. MATT Oh. Me and Fred used it when we wrote the foamy cat fight script last week. 71    INT. FRED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         71 Matt and Fred are giggling and prancing around the room in bikinis discharging the fire extinguishers at each other. 72    INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                             72 Deacon looks at him strangely for a beat, then runs into the 72A   INT. BASEMENT - LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY  Hurry! Deacon turns the dial to ""large load,"" pauses and chuckles to himself."
deacon,"Large load. MATT  What's going on here? DEACON'S PARENTS are standing in the doorway to the kitchen with Max, whose arm is in a splint. Max stares at Ashley. She covers herself some more. Then, Deacon and Matt enter the kitchen from downstairs. MAX Nice rack. DEACON Mom! Dad! What are you doing home? MRS. LEWIS Max sprained his wrist at soccer practice. What is going on here? MR. LEWIS Well, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation why there's a naked girl in our kitchen. Right, Deacon? Deacon isn't too sure. MRS. LEWIS Well... DEACON I, uh... Deacon's mind is racing. Then,"
ashley,I'm Deacon's girlfriend. Ashley. MRS. LEWIS                       MR. LEWIS            * His girlfriend?                  His girlfriend?                *
deacon,"Yes, my girlfriend. MRS. LEWIS And what were you doing with your clothes off in my kitchen? ASHLEY We were having a make out party. MRS. LEWIS Where are the other girls? DEACON Their dates stood them up? COOP Yeah. My date wasn't feeling well. FRED Mine has mono. From too much making out. With me. MRS. LEWIS What's that smell? MATT We had a small fire, Mrs. Lewis. I tipped over a candle. It was to set the right mood. MR. LEWIS A fire? Let me see the damage. DEACON Dad, don't. Let me take responsibility. We'll pay to have it fixed. Deacon's Dad looks at Ashley again. He can't hide his pride. MR. LEWIS Damn right you will. MRS. LEWIS Well, Ashley. I didn't know Deacon even had a girlfriend. MR. LEWIS Maybe you can join us for dinner tonight. Ashley looks at Deacon. Deacon's Mom glares at Dad."
deacon,"I think Ashley's busy tonight-- ASHLEY Okay. Oh, shit. MRS. LEWIS Okay, then. 74   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                           74 Ashley is eating dinner with the Lewises. Max keeps staring at her. Mr. Lewis steals a few glances of Ashley himself while continuing his work-related rant. MR. LEWIS So get this. Johnson comes up to me today and he's all like ""where's the ND-90's?"" I'm like, ""Johnson, they discontinued the ND-90 like six weeks ago."" I've been telling this guy... ASHLEY Johnson sounds like a moron. MR. LEWIS Exactly! Mr. Lewis is psyched that someone is finally paying attention to him. Mrs. Lewis doesn't like the way he's looking at her. MRS. LEWIS So, Ashley. If I could ask you a personal question, exactly how old are you? ASHLEY Nineteen. But I tell people eighteen. Deacon laughs nervously. DEACON Isn't that funny? The doorbell rings. DEACON  I'll get it. FOYER Deacon open the door. It's Naomi. DEACON What are you doing here?"
naomi,"I thought I'd come by and surprise you. Maybe we could hang out in your bedroom. She looks at him seductively. Deacon looks over his shoulder. DEACON Now's not a good time. NAOMI What's wrong? DEACON Nothing. Let's talk later. He tries to close the door, but she stops it. MRS. LEWIS  Deacon, who is it? Too late. Naomi comes in. NAOMI Hi, Mrs. Lewis. I'm Naomi. I'm Deacon's girlfriend. And with that she looks at Deacon, figuring she just made his day. It fails, however, to achieve the desired effect. MRS. LEWIS His girlfriend? She looks at Deacon. Max pokes his head through. MAX Deacon has two girlfriends? DEACON Shut up, Max! NAOMI What do you mean? What's going on? MAX Deacon's other girlfriend is having dinner with us. DEACON I can explain. Naomi walks into the kitchen with Max. MAX This is Deacon's other girlfriend, Ashley."
naomi,"She's a porno actress in your porno film. She had to pretend to be your girlfriend because she ran upstairs naked when the light caused a fire. And you've never had sex with her or even kissed her. DEACON Yeah, pretty much. He looks down. DEACON  Okay. Okay. 76   CLOSE ON a computer monitor displaying the A.S.S. Website.         76 The cursor is clicking through the various pages: text stories, pictures of the set, still photos of Ashley and Coop, etc. But more importantly, the ""hits"" counter looks like the odometer on a rocket ship. PULL BACK to reveal..."
greitzer,"I'm sorry! I'll never rent them again! It was only that one time my wife was at her sister's! Please! I promise you! GREITZER'S WIFE You rented a dirty movie? You told me it was Jakob the Liar! Mike lowers the gun and they start backing out of there. GREITZER What? I shouldn't be entitled to a little joy in life? GREITZER'S WIFE Now look at the trouble you've brought to this house. GREITZER And I'm supposed to know the Religious Right would come after me for renting an adult film? As they continue to fight, Vic and Mike run back to the car. 79   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                                79 Dress rehearsals. Naomi is sitting at the kitchen table talking to Ashley, who's wearing a sexy cheerleader outfit. Deacon is at the microwave making popcorn. NAOMI Five hundred dollars a night? ASHLEY Yeah, but if you can break into films, like these ones, you can get featured dancing gigs and make ten times that much. NAOMI No way. ASHLEY Seriously. If these guys ever get their act together. Matt stumbles in carrying a pile of scripts. Fred walks in behind him and sees Naomi. FRED What is she doing here? DEACON Naomi is my girlfriend."
matt,"He's not a geek. He's the Math Team Captain. NAOMI No, he should be really well-dressed, and maybe he's a foreign exchange student from Portugal. MATT Um, and the director is the only one who's allowed to say ""cut."" FRED Who cares, Naomi? NAOMI Deacon agrees with me, don't you? Matt and Fred look at Deacon. COOP Dudes, come on. My nuts are getting cold. ASHLEY I'm out of here. NAOMI Shut up, Coop. This is important. COOP  And my nuts aren't? Coop's hand accidentally smacks Ashley in the nose as she's getting up. She SCREAMS. DEACON Are you okay? COOP I'm sorry, Ashley. She's pissed, holding her nose. ASHLEY Look. This is ridiculous. Who does dress rehearsals for a porno shoot? MATT Oh, sure. Why don't we throw out the script while we're at it and ""improvise."""
ashley,"Guys, I appreciate the money. It's nice to get paid for sitting around doing nothing, but this isn't helping my career. I've got no footage for my reel. She packs up. FRED Where are you going? ASHLEY Sorry. She leaves. COOP Ashley, wait. I'm sorry. Ashley! Then, he blurts out something unexpected: COOP  I love you! Coop exchanges an awkward glance with the guys: he's said too much. He goes after Ashley, with his pants still around his ankles and his bare ass in full display. He stumbles on his pants and falls on his face. He gets up quickly and continues after her, still with his pants down. FRED Now what are we going to do? Your ""girlfriend"" ruined everything. DEACON Coop's the one that smacked her. NAOMI Besides, if you losers knew anything about women, we wouldn't have this problem. FRED Who asked you? NAOMI I don't have to take this. She storms off, leaving Deacon there to make a decision. He looks at Matt and Fred for a beat, then follows Naomi. Fred and Matt are crushed. 80   EXT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - DAY                                80 Ashley is walking through the parking lot on the way to work."
naomi,"What? I thought you might want some new clothes. DEACON I don't need any new clothes. NAOMI And guess what? I booked facials for us at the Serenity Spa. DEACON Naomi. Wait. Stop. He stops her. NAOMI What's wrong? DEACON I have to meet up with Matt and Fred this afternoon. I already blew them off yesterday. NAOMI Deacon, you don't have to hang out with those guys any more. Besides, you really need a facial. And I mean, I thought we could spend the day together. You know, after last night. DEACON But what about Matt and Fred? NAOMI Well what about me? She pouts. She has him under her thumb. He takes her hand and continues into the store. 86   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                         86 Deacon walks in really late, but wearing a hot new Peachtree & Finch outfit. And his skin seems to glow. Matt and Fred glare at him from the far end of the couch. DEACON What's going on? Are we going to find another girl?  What? FRED Matt and I have been talking. DEACON Yeah. About what?"
matt,"We want to make this movie. DEACON I know. I do, too. FRED No, Deacon. We want to make the movie we wrote. We want to make it without you. DEACON Okay. I know what this is about, guys. I'm sorry about Naomi. FRED That's not the problem, Deacon. DEACON Then what is it? FRED I thought this was about us having fun and doing something crazy together. But as soon as you got what you wanted, you blew us off. DEACON You don't understand. Fred cuts to the chase. FRED Do you even like her? Deacon is about to tell them. Then, DEACON Fine. Go ahead without me. FRED Fine. Matt and Fred get up and leave."
deacon,"I wanted to say I'm sorry. FRED For what? DEACON For blowing you guys off. MATT That's okay, Deacon. DEACON No, it's not. It's just sometimes I feel like the whole world is passing us by and we're just sitting still. I don't know. Anyway, I'm sorry. FRED You know, you can be a real dick sometimes. Then, Fred smiles. Deacon knows they're cool with each other. DEACON Naomi and I did it the other night. MATT No way! FRED You're kidding, right? DEACON No, it's true. FRED How was it? DEACON Good.   At first. But then I kept   thinking about   all the pornos. Trying to   hit the right   spots, positions. I don't   know. After   a while it kind of seemed   like work. MATT I find that extremely difficult to believe. Deacon laughs. FRED So what now? Do we make this thing?"
deacon,"I don't know. Maybe we should just call it quits. ASHLEY  Make a wish. Deacon is too entranced to close his eyes, but he does take the opportunity to blow the eyelash off her hand. She smiles and brushes back a strand of hair from his brow. The guys are hooked. Up through the window, over on Deacon's computer, the A.S.S. Website is running, featuring Roger's smiling face with the motto, ""By Virgins, For Virgins."" The counter is on fire. 94   INT. HAIRDRESSER - DAY                                            94 Roger is getting his hair cut by a cute HAIRDRESSER, his wheelchair next to him. A few other women are in the back, whispering and looking over at Roger. An OPERA ARIA plays on the radio. HAIRDRESSER So, I'm thinking about getting into films."
roger,"Okay. HAIRDRESSER You have any tips on how to break in? ROGER Uh, no. Not really. Acting classes, I guess. HAIRDRESSER Really? I didn't think there was a lot of acting in those films. Roger is confused. ROGER Well, I guess it kind of depends. HAIRDRESSER You think you could get me an audition? ROGER For what? HAIRDRESSER Come on. How long have I been cutting your hair? ROGER Since I was like eight. HAIRDRESSER  Relax. ROGER What're you-- Oh, God!"
matt,"I can't even watch it. Every time I turn it on, I keep thinking about that tuna fish sandwich and Coop farting all day long. DEACON That was pretty gross. MATT That's just it. The movie looks great, but seeing everything else -- all the disgusting, nasty stuff -- that's what's taken all the fun out of it. And I just don't want to do it any more. FRED Great. I knew it. I knew you couldn't handle this. Matt looks away. DEACON Take it easy, Fred. FRED No, I knew that when it came down to it, Matt would wuss out. Matt snaps. MATT You know what? Fuck you, Fred. You're the wuss here. At least I don't have to whack off every time I see a girl in the hallway. Fred shoves Matt. FRED Shut up, Matt. Matt stands up and gets in Fred's face. MATT No, you shut up! For once in your life, be a man and admit this movie was a mistake. FRED Why don't you make me? The two square off, staring each other down. Until, DEACON No. Matt's right. This movie was a mistake."
fred,"What are you talking about? This whole thing was your idea. DEACON Come on, Fred. Didn't you think this movie was going to be ... I don't know, sexy? Fred looks at the other two for a beat, not sure what to say. Finally, he smiles. FRED How long have you guys known about the bathroom thing? Deacon laughs. MATT If you didn't like making the movie, why didn't you say something? FRED I don't know. I thought you guys were having fun. I didn't want to be the wuss. A beat. FRED  - NIGHT                             98 The tape is burning in the center of a huge bonfire. A massive party is raging. Tons of teenagers are dancing, drinking, and having a good time rocking to a LIVE BAND. At the center of it all are Matt, Fred, and Deacon are finally enjoying themselves."
ashley,"Hey, guys. Great party. DEACON Thanks. ASHLEY I've got some big news. I sent the reel to Vivid and they want to fly me and Coop to L.A. to talk about a contract. MATT Wow. That's great, Ashley. DEACON Congratulations. Deacon hugs her. BOUNCER  Hey, what was I supposed to say? Then, Roger wheels by, arm in arm with his Hairdresser. No more braces and headgear, Roger looks sharp with slicked back hair and suave clothes."
roger,"Hey, guys. Great party. He wheels off. The guys and Ashley do a double take. 99    EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - PARKING LOT - NIGHT                           99 The Bouncer is checking off names from the invite list. A long line of people are trying to get in, including J.T. J.T. I can't believe these losers are having such a killer party. Coop is walking by and overhears the comment. COOP Hey, you're not on the list, dude. J.T. What's with you, you pussy? Are you joining the retard team, too? Just then, Plantain enters and walks to the front of the line. The high school guys stop everything to stare at her. PLANTAIN Coop! COOP Plantain. Plantain kisses him, while nonchalantly grabbing his crotch. PLANTAIN Come on. You don't need to wait in this line. Deacon and the guys are already inside. Coop puts his arms around her and walks away, not without looking back over his shoulder for a second at J.T. standing there, dumbfounded. Then, the Bouncer escorts J.T. away. 100   EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT                                        100 Ashley is walking by Wendy and Kelly. WENDY I can't believe Naomi dumped Jake for Deacon Lewis. Ashley stops. ASHLEY Let me tell you something about Deacon. That boy is amazing in bed."
kelly,"And you are...? ASHLEY Ashley. Deacon's ex. WENDY Seriously? ASHLEY Seriously. Have your boyfriends ever given you an orgasm? WENDY No. KELLY I think so.  No. ASHLEY Have you ever felt so completely satisfied in bed that you just wanted to sleep for a week? KELLY AND WENDY No. ASHLEY You're wasting your time giving those Neanderthals blowjobs. I mean, they'll probably wind up unemployed wife beaters anyway. KELLY So, are Deacon's friends seeing anybody? ASHLEY Matt and Fred? I don't think so. But if you're interested, you better move fast. Those guys know how to do this thing ... She whispers something to Wendy and Kelly. They look shocked. Ashley walks off... 100A   EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT                                      100A ...and finds Deacon, sitting alone on a broken-down ride. She sits down next to him. ASHLEY How's Naomi? DEACON I don't know. Good, I guess."
ashley,"I thought she was your fantasy girl. DEACON Yeah. She was. ASHLEY You're gonna dump her. DEACON I don't want to. I don't know. It's not like it was when I was with Rachael. Rachael and I used to talk about stuff. We just, I don't know, connected. ASHLEY Very good, Deacon. Deacon is confused. DEACON What do you mean? ASHLEY Oh, nothing. I guess I'm just glad that you finally figured it out. A moment of realization. DEACON Yeah, I guess I did.  I guess. Or not. Whatever. Deacon smiles. He finally understands that Ashley really does care about him. Ashley kisses him on the cheek and exits off into the horizon. 101   EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT                                      101 Deacon holds Naomi's hand and they walk and talk. DEACON There's something I want to talk to you about. NAOMI What? DEACON I've been thinking. Maybe we should see other people."
naomi,"What? DEACON Well, I mean, we don't really have anything in common. And we don't really even get along. NAOMI You're breaking up with me?  They're perverts! They make porno movies in their basement!"
matt,"I think he's got something there. Making that movie felt like we were tampering with forces we couldn't possibly understand. DEACON Exactly. The fun part about high school is unravelling the mystery of what's going to happen next. The guys smile and dial the combinations on their lockers. In the background, Jake is still on the ground crying. We TRACK through the hallway, outside... 121C   EXT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY                  121C ... where we see a large CAR TRANSPORT, with three hot new sports cars on it.
