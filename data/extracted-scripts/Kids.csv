Speaker,Dialogue
black screen," The very loud sound of people having sex. The sounds of deep moaning and sexual huffs and puffs. After a few seconds the sound grows even louder. It should sound as if the two people are fucking into a microphone. The sounds should be painful and raw.  GIRL  Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh yes."
girl,"Oh yes, Telly it hurts, oh yes, oh yes, please Telly, Telly."
telly,You know what I want to do?
girl,Yeah.
telly,What do I want to do?
telly, Why?
girl,"Because, you know why. You know."
telly,Because your a virgin?
girl,Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
telly,"You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff."
girl,Why is that?
telly,Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
girl,I wouldn't believe it?
telly,I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
girl,"But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us."
telly,"What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.  I want to make you happy. That's all."
telly, You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
girl, Do you care about me?
telly, Of course I do.
casper,Shit.
telly, Was up bitch?
casper,Oh shit what happened?
telly,What do you think?
casper,You fucked it?
casper,"I knew you fucked it! I sat out her for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!"
telly, Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
casper,"Well, how was it?"
telly,"Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck."
casper,She can fuck?
telly,Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
casper,Oh shit. How long did it take?
telly,Did what take?
casper,How long did you fuck her?
telly,"Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time."
casper,Yeah.
telly,But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
casper,How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
telly,Take a whiff.
casper,"Oh man, it smells like butterscotch."
telly,Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
casper,"Oh man, that's the best."
telly,You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
casper,Let me smell it again.
casper,That's why virgins are the best. I love that smell.
telly,You know what else?
casper,What?
telly,I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
casper,How?
telly,"Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right."
casper,Right.
telly,"And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cut when you were little."
casper,Yeah.
telly,"And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup."
telly,"And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby."
casper,Yeah.
telly,"And for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl."
casper,Fuckin perverted bastard.
telly,I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
casper,To what? Virgins?
telly,"Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies."
casper,What do you mean?
telly,"I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit."
casper,You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
telly," That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen."
casper, She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
telly,"I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect."
casper,Did you tell her that you loved her?
telly,Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
casper,Shit.
telly,What do you want?
casper,Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
telly,Are you hungry?
casper,Hell yeah. Fuckin starvin. Wait up a sec.
telly,You wanna go to Paul's house?
casper,What for? That guys a dick.
telly,I'm sue he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
casper,You think he's got any herb?
telly,"I don't know, he quit dealin but I'll bet he'll smoke us out."
casper,You think?
telly,Probably.
casper,He lives on 76th?
telly,78th.
casper,Den less go Joe.
casper,Telly.
telly,Yeah.
casper,Did she suck your dick?
telly,A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
casper,Why?
telly,I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
casper,It is right.
telly,"I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost."
casper,"It's no big deal, right?"
telly,"Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it."
casper,"Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first."
telly,Yep.
casper,They're gonna tell their grand kids.  That Telly. He sure was good in the sack!
telly,You thirsty?
casper,"Yeah, I feel dehydrated."
telly,You got any money?
casper,Three pennies and a ball of lint.
telly,You down with the boost?
casper," Unzip my pack, yo."
telly,"Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?"
telly,Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
telly,"Diss digg, diss digg, diss digg."
telly,I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?
casper,"He said This Dick, mutha fucka! Can't you understand English?"
korean man,Stupy fucky boys! Fucky!
casper,"You know like in ""The Wonder Twins"" they share everything."
telly,The cartoon?
casper,"Yeah. ""The Wonder Twins"". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water."
telly,Yeah.
casper,"Well, those guys share everything, right?"
telly,Right.
casper,"And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?"
telly,Right.
casper,And it got me thinkin. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
telly," Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring."
casper,"No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated ""Wonder Twins""!"
casper, Can you do it man?
telly," Can I do it? I just brooke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire."
casper,Oh man. I fucking love this guy.
paul, Hello?
telly,It's me. Telly.
paul, Hello?
telly, Paul it's Telly. Open up.
paul,What are you guys doing?
telly,Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
paul,You want a wip-it?
telly,Nah.
casper,Yeah.
casper,I love these shits.
paul,They're good for you. Vitamin C for the new generation.
casper,That's why I like 'em. They wake my brain up.
telly,"So, how many people live here now?"
paul,"I don't know, eight or nine."
telly,Where does everyone sleep?
paul,"Everywhere. Fuckin flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub."
stanley,Yo Telly. Jennie says what's up.
telly,Jennie who?
stanley,Jennie. You know.
casper,That girl you boned last year. Remember?
telly,Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
ruby,Telly says was up.
jennie,I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
ruby,You still mad at him?
jennie,Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
susan,What did he do?
ruby,He stole her virginity. He took it away and now it's gone forever.
jennie,Yeah. But it's not even the fact that he devirginized me. It's the fact that after it was done he never spoke to me again. He talked all this bullshit and then just broke out.
linda,That's the kinda shit he's into. Telly is known for that stuff. He fucked Amber the same way.
susan,And Susan too.
jennie,"But he was all like, Oh Jennie I like you so much. Trust me you'll love it, I'm not gonna use you. I promise. He was poppin mad jazz."
susan,First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
jennie,Oh yeah.
ruby,"And we did it in the bush. Like outside around midnight. I got fucking mosquito bits all over my ass. And we thought everyone was sleeping, but they obviously weren't because everybody knew. And it was out on the grass somewhere. And it hurt like a motha, oh my god the pain!"
linda, That's the shit! That's the shit!
ruby,The pain. The fucking pain!
jennie,And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
ruby,You are being ripped open.
jennie,I know.
ruby,Did you bleed?
jennie,I didn't bleed.
ruby,You didn't?
jennie,"No, I didn't bleed."
susan,I bled. I fucking bled all over the sheets.
diane,Me too.
ruby,"I bled. I bled like on the condom, there was blood everywhere. And you know what he started singing? He started singing ""Sunday Bloody Sunday."" That stupid fucking song."
ruby,I was like... I was like... No. They sang that the whole sleep away. My reputation!
diane,It doesn't even matter though. It's such bullshit. The reputation is bullshit.
ruby,I know.
diane,You know.
jennie,Yep.
diane,I don't give a fuck. I have sex and I like fucking.
ruby,Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
jennie,Foreplay. Foreplay.
linda, Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
ruby,"Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!"
linda,Yep.
ruby,Making love is like.
linda,Sweet.
susan,Slow.
ruby,It's grandmother style.
linda,Yeah.
ruby,It's like...
linda,"You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww."
ruby,Yeah.
linda,Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
ruby,It's really slow. It's slow boring.
susan,Yeah.
ruby,It's very monotonous.
linda,"Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex,"
susan,It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
ruby,Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
jennie,Passion...
ruby,Boom!!! Boom!!!
stanley,"Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
paul,"That's the one thing. They expect you to be so gentle, so kind..."
zack,When most of time you just wanna be all. Pounding on that shit.
stanley,That would be the best if you could just be. Excuse me can I borrow your hole Miss? It'll only take a little while. I'll give it right back.
telly,But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
casper,Yep.
telly,I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
casper,Yeah me too nigga.
susan,You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
linda,Yep.
susan,You know. Because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. And then when it actually comes time for sex. It's like the worst letdown.
jennie,"Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know."
ruby,"Hell yeah, they don't know."
jennie,Like where are your erogenous zones?
ruby,Mine?
jennie,Mine are like my neck and my chest.
linda,Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
ruby,"Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there..."
linda,Oh shit.
ruby,"And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco"
susan,Right.
ruby,And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
susan,Yeah.
ruby,He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
ruby, Work it.
susan,You know why I decided to go out with Alex.
jennie,Why?
susan, He has the best fucking fingers I've ever had.
susan, I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
linda,That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
susan,Yep.
linda,Because he can like climax you up to that...
jennie,... Point.
linda,Yep. Where just one more move and you would be like crazy.
ruby,Yep.
linda,But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
ruby,Yeah it's the biggest disappointment!
susan,Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
ruby,To come?
susan,"Yeah. I had sex with Jake, and it took him like an hour and a half."
linda,Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
ruby,Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
linda,Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
ruby,Yeah I get bored.
linda,I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards.
susan,"Yeah, eat. I got real thirsty too."
casper,You know what I notice?
zack,What?
casper,I notice that girls love to give head. It's like a secret pastime hobby for them. Or somethin'.
stanley,Some girls.
casper,All girls. They love it. I know.
casper, I hate this game.
telly,No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
paul,Yeah. But when it's just you and them. That's like the first thing they go for.
casper,I know. They love it. That's why girls live longer than guys. 'Cause sperm has vitamin C.
jennie,I hate sucking dick!
ruby,"Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear."
jennie,"And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging."
ruby,"Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever."
jennie,Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
ruby,And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
linda,And you don't get shit out of it.
susan,Have you ever swallowed it before?
jennie,No.
susan,Me neither.
ruby,I have.
ruby,It was... it was.
susan,"It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter."
ruby,"No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something."
susan,Yeah.
ruby,You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting.
telly,All I know is that condoms suck. They don't work. They break. They slip off. It's impossible to feel anything. They make your dick shrink. But I still use 'em. Or at least I did once.
jennie,I mean. Telly is the only guy I've ever had sex with. You knew that.
diane,No. I didn't know that. I thought you got with A.J. too.
jennie,"No, we just messed around."
paul,That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
telly,Yep.
casper,Yeah. It's a great big fraud.
ruby,I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
linda,Yeah.
ruby,"And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe."
linda,Yeah.
ruby,"And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie."
ruby,I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
linda,Did they ask you a lot of questions?
black nurse,How old you?
white nurse,How old are you?
black nurse,How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
ruby,Umm. Altogether?
black nurse,Yes. Altogether.
ruby,"Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine."
black nurse,How many times have you gone unprotected?
ruby,"With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three."
white nurse,How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
jennie,One.
white nurse,Were you protected?
jennie,No.
black nurse,Have you ever had anal intercourse?
ruby,Yes.
black nurse,With how many people?
ruby,Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
black nurse,Were they wearing condoms?
ruby,Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
white nurse,Have you ever had anal intercourse?
jennie,No.
black nurse,Okee dokey. You should come back in seven days and we should have your results.
jennie, Thanks.
casper,"Man, this guy is really good."
telly,He looks like my uncle.
casper,I bet he makes hella money.
ruby,"... I don't know, I think he's mad at me, but who cares..."
black nurse,"Woowee! It must have been something I ate!  Ruby, follow me."
ruby,Wish me luck.
jennie,Good luck.
white nurse,Jennie.
black nurse," Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections."
ruby,Yes!
black nurse,You're clean.
ruby,Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
black nurse,Now you gotta be careful.
black nurse,Here take these pamphlets home and read them.
white nurse,Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
jennie,What?
white nurse,The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
jennie,I tested positive?
white nurse,I'm sorry.
jennie,But I only had sex with Telly.
jennie,I just got tested to keep Ruby company.
telly,I wanna fuck Darcy.
casper,Who?
telly,Darcy. Benny's little sister.
casper,Oh. You like her?
telly,Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
casper,Darcy?
telly,"Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent."
telly,It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
casper,Yeah.
telly,"She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her."
casper, Yeah.
telly,I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
casper, Yeah.
telly,"And after about two seconds, I got the biggest hard-on."
telly,"I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection."
casper,I know what you mean.
telly,"At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin."
casper,She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
telly,I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
casper, How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
telly,I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
casper,Bet.
casper,You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
telly,I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
legless man, I have no legs. I have no legs. I have no legs. I have no legs.
legless man,Thank you. God bless you.
casper,Yeah. Bless you back.
telly,I don't understand why you do that.
casper,Why I do what?
telly,That.
casper,Why I give pennies?
telly,Yeah. Why you give money.
casper,Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
telly,That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
casper,What are you talking about?
telly,"Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by."
casper,So.
telly,"So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks."
casper,So. You never know when you can end up like that.
telly,Right.
casper,"I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off."
telly,Shut up.
casper,"I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did."
casper,"So really, it's good luck."
telly,Good luck?
casper,"Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs."
jennie,Ruby. Do you have a quarter?
jennie," Peter, is Mom there? No, I need to speak to Mommy... Peter where's Mommy? No, I can't talk to you right now. Yeah... I hear it... look just tell her... No never mind... Go watch television."
ruby,"Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK."
jennie,"That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore."
ruby,Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
jennie,I only did it once and...
ruby,Get the fuck outta here man!
ruby, I said get the fuck outta here before I smash your fucking face in mothafucka!!!
jennie,I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
ruby,Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
jennie,I gotta find him.
ruby,I'm coming.
jennie,No. I just gotta go find him.
ruby,Jen!

telly,Ten for you.
telly,Get the fuck out of here cat!
telly,You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
casper,"Yo, you got any weed around here?"
telly,Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
casper,Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
telly,You are?
casper,"Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles."
casper,I'm gonna get mad diesel. I'm gonna fuck any nigga that tries to step to me.
telly,You want some?
casper,Nah.

taxi driver,Excuse me. Can I ask you a question?
taxi driver,Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
jennie,What?
taxi driver,"Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin maybe."
jennie,No. I'm OK. Thanks.
taxi driver,You're OK?
jennie,Yeah.
taxi driver,"Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean your a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all..."
jennie,"Yeah well, it's been a bad day."
taxi driver,A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
jennie,Sorry.
taxi driver,Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
taxi driver,You know. I could tell you were sad by the way your eyes drooped. Like an adopted kid. That's the way an adopted kid's eyes look. All sad like that. All droopy and sweet. Like the honey that I lick off my finger.
taxi driver,Would I be prying if I asked you what was wrong?
taxi driver,"Miss, would I be prying?"
jennie,Everything is wrong.
taxi driver,"No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?"
jennie,"Yeah, I guess so."
taxi driver,Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
jennie,No.
taxi driver,Are you in trouble with the law?
jennie,No.
taxi driver,Am I getting warm?
taxi driver,Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
jennie,Yeah?
taxi driver,"Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her."
jennie,Thanks.
taxi driver,Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
taxi driver,Hey look. Whatever it is. Just forget about it. Life's too short. Make yourself happy. I'll give you an example. When my golden retriever passed away. God rest his soul.  I was lonesome. I missed him. So I got a tattoo.
taxi driver,Now how do you like that? Now he's with me forever.
taxi driver,"I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes."
jennie,Yeah?
taxi driver,Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
jennie,What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
taxi driver,"Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, ""Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk"" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier."
taxi driver,That's life.
jennie,Your a real philosopher.
taxi driver,Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
taxi driver,"Well here we are, Miss."
taxi driver,"Aw, don't worry 'bout it. The rides on me."
taxi driver,"All right, all right, I'll take it. But forget about the tip."
jennie,Thanks. Bye.
taxi driver,"Oh yeah. Oh Miss. Miss. When you smile, God notices. That's why the sun is shining."

casper,No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.
harold,Yeah me too.
kim,"Casper, why do you think I would let you suck on my boobs?"
casper,I don't know. Your just sitting there. And your tits look clean to me. It makes me  want to suck on 'em.
darcy,I thought you had a girlfriend.
telly,Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
darcy,No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
telly,She won't? Why not?
telly,Yeah. I can understand that.
harold,I truth or dare you guys to kiss each other.
joy,Sure. We kiss all the time.
casper,You guys are dykes right?
kim,No.
steven,Then how can you kiss each other like that?
harold,Yeah. How can you do that shit?
kim,It doesn't matter. It just feels good. That's all.
joy,"Yeah. It's not like we're gay. It's just kissing another person, a friend."
kim,Yeah.
joy,It's no big deal.
casper,I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
harold,Yeah. Do it again.
telly,You should come back with me to Steven's house.
