president bush," Americans are a resolute people, who have risen to every test of our time. Adversity has revealed the character of our country, to the world, and to ourselves... Bob wipes his eyes, stares at the screen."
determination,American troops pull down a huge statue of Saddam Hussein in central Baghdad. An American flag draped over the head is hastily replaced by an Iraqi flag.
bob,"Yeah, no it's been...well, I won't lie to you Debora - it's been pretty damn hairy."

bob,"Oh, that's, that's... He BEATS his head off the wall for a moment."
bob,Yeah. They laugh.
second journalist,How?
second journalist,"Yeah, they don't like the unilats. The troops think the unilats'll stab `em in the back. When you're"

second journalist,"Went into Baghdad with Charlie Company, Second Brigade, Third Infantry Division..."
first journalist,The thunder run? Heard you had it pretty bad.

first journalist,You know a Private First Class Zuchero?
second man,"Zook? I was standing next to him when he took a hit... Bob sits ignored, feeling inadequate as they continue to swap war stories."
bob, So what's a useful phrase?
kuwait waiter,"La termi, ana sahafi. Bob repeats this."
bob,What's that mean?
kuwait waiter,"Don't shoot, I'm a reporter. He walks off. Bob sighs, continues DOODLING in his notebook. We see he has covered the page in stylized drawings of EYES. He notices a A MAN IN A BASEBALL CAP sitting at the next table."
man, Hey. Bob reads the logo on the baseball cap.
bob,DeWitt Resources. Arkansas.
bob,You over here for the conference? Looking for a contract right?

man,I guess.
bob,"What's your pitch? The man considers this. He looks up and we see his face for the first time - handsome, older than Bob, tanned, a moustache, a slightly haunted expression. This is LYN"
man,"Well...we're real cheap. Bob waits for more, but that's it. He holds out his hand."
bob,Bob Wilton.
bob,"Could I bum a smoke, Skip? Lyn shoves the packet across the table. Bob sits down across from him, pats himself down for a lighter, glances over to where the two embedded Journalists are joking with some Marines. Bob watches them jealously."

gus lacey,"Then there's the seminars. When I'm not teaching I spend a lotta time, right here, remote viewing."
bob,Right here?
gus lacey,"The kitchen table. That is correct. That's where my body is. But my mind...that's, you know... He gestures to the horizon."
bob,Wandering?
gus lacey,Wandering. Roaming. Yeah.
bob,So what have you seen lately?

gus lacey,"Lately I've been watching the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland, England - which it turns out is the ghost of a dinosaur. That's an exclusive for you."
bob,Okay. Wow. E.C.U of Bob's notebook - on which he has written You are Crazy.
gus lacey,"It started when I was a kid. I used to lie on my bed and RV my cousin, Irene, undressing at night. Then, when I was in the army I joined Bill Django's unit. He trained me and the rest, as they say..."
bob,Right. I don't know who that is. Gus gives a dreamy smile.
gus lacey,I can't really talk about Bill.
bob,So what did you do in the army?
gus lacey,"We were Psychic Spies mainly. That was our initial tasking but...once they realized what they were sitting on, the forces at work... He stops, his face darkening."
gus lacey,With our minds. That is correct. Just by staring at them.
14., 17   CONTINUED:                                             17
gus lacey,One of our unit stopped the heart of a goat.
bob,Wow. I don't know what to say.
gus lacey,The power they unlocked in us...  You wanna see?
gus lacey,You ever seen a hamster do that before?
bob,"Well, I've never owned a hamster Gus, so I don't know what..."
gus lacey,Look at the way it's glaring at its wheel. Usually that hamster loves its wheel.
bob,Maybe some of the readers have hamsters so...
gus lacey,Good. Then they'll know how rare that is.
bob,"Yeah, I guess any hamster-owning readers will know what's aberrant behavior and, uh, what's...Oh, shit, he's down! ON TV one of the hamsters has fallen over."
15., 18   CONTINUED:                                                18
gus lacey,"Yeah, he's down. At this point I'd been staring at him for about three hours. The other hamster falls over."
bob,Oh my God! You've dropped both hamsters!
gus lacey,"No, the other one's just fallen over. They watch in silence. Then the hamsters get up and start eating."
bob,Well...it didn't die. I thought you said you killed it?
bob,Who's the Skipper?
gus lacey,Lyn Cassady. After Bill he was the most psi-gifted guy I ever met. He was like an Occultic force.  I think he runs a dance studio now.
16., 18   CONTINUED:                                            18
bob,Do you...do you know a Gus Lacey? Beat. Lyn gets up and walks away.
bob,Whoa!
lyn cassady,You working for Hooper?
bob,Hooper? No. I work for the Ann Arbor Daily Telegram.
lyn cassady,How do you know about Lacey?
bob,"I interviewed him a few years ago. He'd been appearing on this radio talk show. Lyn relaxes his martial arts stance, shakes his head ruefully."
lyn cassady,Little prick...what'd he tell you?
bob,"He said he joined Bill Django's unit in the army and was trained to, to, uh remote view?"
lyn cassady,(shaking his head in
bob,Yes.
lyn cassady,(walking off down the
bob," Are you...? Do you mean you corroborate his, uh...? Because, see, I thought he was just an idiot?"
bob,"But you're saying there was a secret unit? Lyn stops, turns and stares at him."
lyn cassady,We...don't...divulge.
lyn cassady,Okay. Let me ask you something. What color were the chairs in the hotel bar?
18., 21   CONTINUED:                                                21
lyn cassady,You were in there for hours. What color were the chairs?
bob,Um...brown?
lyn cassady,They were green. How many lights are there in this room? Bob starts to look around.
bob,A Super Soldier?
lyn cassady,A Jedi Warrior. He would know where all the lights were. He could walk through a room and tell you how many power outlets there were. People are walking around with their eyes closed. At Level One we were trained to instantly absorb all details.
lyn cassady,You're looking at one.
bob,You're a Jedi Warrior?
lyn cassady,That's correct.
bob,What does that...? I don't think
lyn cassady,That's correct.
bob,"Hold on, let me...let me just... He takes out his NOTEBOOK, fumbling, trying to get into journalist mode."
lyn cassady,We prefer the term Remote Viewer.
bob,How does that work?
lyn cassady,"Different Jedi had different techniques. Mel Landau used to visualize packing all his cares and worries in a little suitcase, to clear his mind. Steve Cuttle used to read Bible verse..."
bob,What about you? Lyn thinks about it.
lyn cassady,"Well, I find drinking helps. Also if I'm listening to classic rock music."
bob,Yeah?  Like who?
lyn cassady,I like Boston. Boston usually works. Bob jots this down in the notebook.
20., 21   CONTINUED:                                          21
lyn cassady,Invisibility.
bob, Invisibility?
lyn cassady,Yup. That was Level Three.
bob,Actual invisibility?
lyn cassady,"Well...yeah, that was the goal. But after a while we adapted it to just finding a way of not being seen. When you understand the, the linkage between observation and reality, you learn to dance with invisibility. Bob tries to follow this."
bob,Like camouflage?
lyn cassady,"It's not like camouflage. We also practised Phasing. Crossing from particle to wave, from the physical realm to the plane of energy. Solid objects seem to pass right through you. It's starts with a breathing exercise... Lyn makes a weird shallow PANTING SOUND."
bob,"I don't...can I be honest, Lyn? I don't know what to make of this. I don't know what to say. This is amazing stuff.  How would you...I wanna...could I write a story about this? Lyn stops panting, takes a swig of whiskey, stares at the bottle, suddenly taciturn."
lyn cassady,Not going to happen.
21., 21   CONTINUED:                                            21
bob,"No, but see, I've been looking for a story Lyn. I was going to write about the re-build contracts but this...this is even better and  I..."
lyn cassady,Not going to happen.
bob,All I'm saying is we could talk some more tomorrow and...
lyn cassady,I'm shipping out tomorrow.
bob,You're going home?
lyn cassady,Going to Iraq. There's this factory we might be partnering with in Al Qaim. Bob's face falls.
bob,"Oh. They sit in silence for a moment. Lyn passes Bob the whiskey. He takes a swig, his mind whirring..."
bob,"I could come with you, maybe, and..."
lyn cassady,"Bob, I don't want to be a story, okay? I don't need the attention and..."
bob,"No, listen, we could change names, stuff could stay off record and..."
22., 21   CONTINUED:                                          21
lyn cassady,It's a war over there Bob. Okay? A war. I can't be looking out for you. Bob flushes with annoyance.
bob,"Well you know, you don't... I look after myself. Okay? I look after...And I've been in some pretty hairy situations before. I'm not, you know...I'm a journalist, Lyn. You understand? He slaps his notebook for emphasis."
lyn cassady,What's this?
bob,What? Nothing. I was just doodling. Lyn examines Bob - something DIFFERENT IN HIS ATTITUDE.
23., 21   CONTINUED:                                          21
lyn cassady,You wanted to know who Bill Django was?  He's the man who wrote that book.
bob,"The Jedi Warrior will follow in the footsteps of the great Imagineers of the past - Jesus Christ, Lao Tse Tung, Walt Disney..."
24., 25   CONTINUED:                                                 25
lyn cassady,You see it?
bob,I think so.  Lyn?
lyn cassady,Yeah?
bob,Who is this Bill Django? Lyn draws on his cigarette thoughtfully.
lyn cassady,I don't know where to begin.
25., 27   CONTINUED:                                              27
lyn cassady,Bill always said it started for him when he fell out of a helicopter in Vietnam.
bill django,"Oh, man... He tries to pull his finger free, glances up and FREEZES. Ahead of Bill and his Platoon is a WALL OF DEAD AMERICAN TROOPS - rotting in the sun. His men stand staring at the wall aghast. A PRIVATE beside Bill snaps and opens FIRE, yelling wildly."

lyn cassady,What?
bob,The cone. Does it direct your psychic powers or something?
lyn cassady,No.
bob,What does it do? Lyn takes some BURGERS out of a cooler box and puts them into the cone.
lyn cassady,It cooks supper. He examines the stove approvingly.
bob,Yes.  But... He stops.
lyn cassady,What?
bob,Nothing.
lyn cassady,Go on - what?
bob,"Well it's just...it's hard to believe the Pentagon paid for this. I mean, it's very interesting, but there's nothing in here that's actually about...fighting?"

lyn cassady,"The New Earth Army was tasked with preventing conflict. We're a force of peace, not war. Bill realized if you want to change the world, you've got to start by changing the armies. He was the one that started the research into non- lethals."
bob,Non-lethals? Lyn flicks away his cigarette.
lyn cassady,Check this out. He takes a yellow PLASTIC BLOB from his pocket with a flourish.
lyn cassady,You see? You're mine now. The Predator is completely biodegradable. It's friendly to the earth but it can hurt you in a hundred ways. He takes the blob off the finger and rubs it's serrated edge down Bob's temple.
lyn cassady,It has warrior functions. And it looks a bit funny. This is New Earth Army technology. Lyn sticks the Predator in Bob's ear and hauls him to his feet. Bob yells with pain.
32., 39   CONTINUED:                                             39
bob,Stop it! Stop hurting me! Lyn stares at the blob fondly.
lyn cassady,I bought it on line. What's cool about it is that you could see this lying on the ground and you'd never know it had such lethality. Bob holds his ear and pants for breath. Lyn's face lights up.
bob,No!!!!!
bob,I think it's officially night now. Lyn kicks at the stove.
lyn cassady, I've got Crohn's. The steroids help.

eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee,"ee. They finish. Bill nods, smiling, stares around at them."
bill django,"We are a Hollow Army, gentlemen. Vietnam has crushed our soul. We are traumatized and melancholic. We are ashamed. That is why I have brought you to this place of Sanctuary. Here we can mend our wounds and dream our dreams. My dream is of an America that will lead the world to paradise, an America that no longer has an exploitative view of natural resources, that no longer promotes consumption at all costs. I believe this is America's destiny."

official,But why did the Soviets begin this type of research?
brigadier general hopgood,"Well sir, it looks like they heard about our attempt to telepathically communicate with one of our nuclear subs - the Nautilus - while it was under the Polar cap."
brigadier general hopgood,"There was no attempt, sir. It seems the story was a French hoax. But the Russians think the story about the story being a French hoax is just a story sir."
second official,"So, they've started psi research because they thought we were doing psi research, when in fact we weren't doing psi research?"
36., 49    CONTINUED:                                                    49
brigadier general hopgood,"Yes sir. But now that they are doing psi research, we're going to have to do psi research, sir. We can't afford to have the Russians leading the field in the paranormal. The Officials consider this gravely."
bob," Oh God. Oh God. He stops, staring at the immense empty landscape ahead of him."

bob,I didn't...I thought...What are you doing?
lyn cassady,Salute to the Sun. He finishes and jumps down.
bob,What are you doing?
lyn cassady,Cloud bursting. Keeps me in shape. Bob stares up at the clouds.
bob,Really? Which one?
bob,That one?
lyn cassady,No. That one. The big one.
bob,Isn't that one too far away? Lyn looks at Bob like he's crazy.
lyn cassady,They're all far away.

bob,Jesus Lyn. You had like the whole desert to drive in... Lyn rubs his face ruefully.
lyn cassady,"Yeah. I'm sorry about that Bob. Must have got a little bi- locational there, you know? But don't worry. Someone'll come along soon."
lyn wheaton,Heads.

bob," Oh, you speak English? Great. Deep Purple. Right. You guys like Deep Purple? You like rock or, or... He suddenly notices the Young Iraqi is holding a HANDGUN. The Driver leans out the window and shouts something over the roar of the engine. The Young Man next to Lyn takes off his scarf and starts to blindfold Lyn with it."
bob,We're going to die! I'm going to be killed by Al Qaeda!

lyn cassady,I don't think they're Al Qaeda.
bob,Oh what the hell do you know? You don't know! You don't know anything! And this is all your fault!
lyn cassady,"Bob, there's something I have to tell you. When I said I was retired from the unit, that was a lie. I'm on a mission. DeWitts was just my cover. I've been reactivated. I couldn't tell you because this is a Black Op, but...I think you have a part to play. I think that's why you're with me. Bob collapses face down on the mattress."
lyn cassady,"Have you heard of Optimum Trajectory before?  Your life is like a river, Bob. If you're aiming for a goal that isn't your destiny, you will always be swimming against the current. Young Ghandi wants to be a stock-car racer? Not gonna happen. Little Anne Frank wants to be a High School teacher. Tough titty Anne. That's not your destiny. But you will go on to move the hearts and minds of millions. Find out what your destiny is and the river will carry you. Now sometimes events in life give an individual clues as to where their Destiny lies."
bob,How are we gonna stop them? There's three of them! And they've got guns!
lyn cassady,"We're Jedi, Bob. The Jedi don't fight with guns. We fight with our minds."
bob,What do you mean?
lyn cassady,Let's say we have no choice but to fight with these men. Then we use visual aesthetics to instill psychically in the enemy a disincentive to attack.
lyn cassady,"Okay, you lock eyes with one of them, you go into a monotone and you say ""No, I'm not going to attack you."" You totally relax your body and your voice. And then you rip out one of his eyeballs."
bob,We haven't got a pen.
bob,Oh...I don't want to Lyn.
lyn cassady,Choke me. What am I gonna do?  Just here. Choke. Choke.
bob,I don't think I...there's sharp edges around here...
lyn cassady,"C'mon... ""Attack me."" Bob stares at him, a little annoyed by this."
bob,What's with the quotation fingers? That's like implying I'm you know...only capable of ironic attacking or...
lyn cassady,"Quit jawing, Bob, and choke me."
lyn cassady,I'm going to interrupt your thought pattern.

bob, Sharp...edges...
lyn cassady," You felt fear didn't you? Before hand? Bob massages his back, impressed despite himself."
bob,Yes.
lyn cassady,Would you say that level of fear was abnormal for you? Bob thinks about this.
bob,"I don't know. I was pretty terrified anyway but the fear I felt on the run-up to the choking did seem, you know, unusual."
younger iraqi,Okay. We go.

lyn cassady,Oprah.
bob,Uhuh.  You really don't work for DeWitts?
lyn cassady,Just my cover.
lyn cassady,No. I do run a dance school. I love dance.
bob,Oh. Okay.  And you're really on a mission out here?
lyn cassady,"In time, Bob."
lyn cassady,We learn to recognize our own kind after a while. You ever dream about flying?
bob,Yes.
lyn cassady,That's one of the signs.
bob,Do you really think so?

lyn cassady,Don't you? Haven't you always really felt you were different? Bob considers this.
bob,Yes. Yes I have.
lyn cassady,That's the way it is for us. We're the ones who don't fit in as kids.
bob,Have you always had powers?
lyn cassady,Kind of. They used to call me the Jinx.

bill django,"I am Lieutenant Colonel Bill Django. From now on, you will speak only when spoken to, and the first and last words out of your mouth will be ""Sir, yes, sir!"" Do you understand?"

lyn cassady,Lyn Cassady sir.
bill django,Where you from?
lyn cassady,"Opelousas, Louisiana, sir. Bill stares at Lyn, taking in his orphan air, his hunted look."

larry hooper,Congratulations Scotty. I'm sorry it doesn't work out for you two. Scotty's face falls. The other Jedis glare at Larry. One of them makes a move towards him but Lyn holds him back.
scotty,It's...it's something cylindrical? I think it's a pencil?
bill django,"Okay. Larry? Larry rolls his eyes up in his head, speaks in a high wavering voice with a bad cockney accent."
larry hooper,"This is Larry's Spirit Guide, Maud. I'm looking into the cupboard now and I'm seeing...I'm seeing...a tin mug?"
bill django,"Lyn? Lyn stares at his hands, focused. He looks up suddenly, puzzled."
lyn cassady,It's a man on a chair. Bill unlocks the little cupboard and takes a photograph of the Lincoln Memorial. There are murmurs of admiration from the watching Jedis.
