tony,Happy birthday... dear Helen

young people,"Twenty-one today, She's twenty-one today, She's got the key of the door, She's never been twenty-one before."
tony,May I?
young man,Look!
helen,I'll ask him in...
helen,I don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs?
helen,... but tonight I'm determined at least to say hello to you! So hello!
helen,I'm Helen Stephens.
helen,I'm having a party - and the other tenants are there...  And a few friends. We'd like you to join us.
mark,Mark...
helen,Pardon?
mark,I'm Mark...
helen,"Hallo, Mark."
helen,"Please come in... you'll meet the others who live here, and..."
mark,"Thank you, but... work."
helen,Oh...

helen,...Mark?
tony,"Darling, your cake - everyone's waiting."
mark,Thank you.
mark,Happy Birthday.
helen,I hope I'm not disturbing you?
helen,I knew you wouldn't come down... so I've brought you this.
mark,Thank you...
mark,... very much...
helen,I mustn't keep you from your work
mark,I'd like to offer you a drink.
helen,"Thank you, Mark."
mark,I haven't one.
helen,I'd adore some water.
helen,"a hostess can't drink water at her own party, it looks like a hint to the guests."
mark,Will you... would you... like to come in?
helen,"Yes, Mark..."
helen,Very much... if you can spare it?
helen,"Thank you, Mark..."
helen,This is a pleasant room... and you've another inside?
mark,Yes.
helen,How long have you lived here?
mark,All my life.
mark,I was born in this house Oh?
mark,It's my father's.
helen,Do you mean I've at last found out who our landlord is? Your father?
mark,Well - no... he's dead!
mark,I'm the landlord.
helen,YOU?
mark,Yes.
helen,But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent.
mark,I haven't.
helen,I meant...
mark,I know.
mark,"It's his house - and I'll never sell it... but I can't afford the upkeep, so I let rooms."
mark,"... if I charge too much, tell me and I'll tell the agents."
helen,"The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others or you'll have no peace."
mark,Peace...?
helen,"Mark, what do you do?"
mark," Most of the time, I work in a film studio."
helen,"On the photographic side, I'll bet."
mark,I hope to be a film director... very soon.
helen,How exciting.
mark,I have some spare time jobs... as well.
helen,To do with photography?
mark,More milk?
helen,No thank you... to do with photography?
mark,Yes... to do with photography...
helen,When I came in were you looking at some films?
mark,Yes.
helen,Of yours?
mark,Yes.
helen,I'd like to see them...
helen,Know I'm being rude... but I really would like to see them...  ...it would be a birthday present... from you to me.
mark,Would it?
helen,"Yes, Mark."
mark,Oh...
helen,But I suppose you're too busy?
mark,Will you... would you... like to see them now?
helen,Thank you...
mark,I'll... go first.
helen,This is so... well - so many things... but above all - it's so...
helen,...completely unexpected!
helen,Is all of it yours?
mark,Yes.
helen,I mean... is it designed by you? Furnished by you? Tell me about this room.
mark,It belonged to my father
helen,What was he?
mark,Scientist...
helen,Then this equipment was his?
mark,No...
mark,Sold his to buy it...
helen,But it seems to be so... technical.
helen,"If this is where you work, I can't wait to see what you work at."
mark,Don't know what to show you?
helen,Well... what were you looking at when I interrupted you?
mark,All right!
mark,This is the first... twenty-first birthday present... I'll ever have given.
helen,It's the first I've ever asked for...
helen,"Mark, what a beautiful child."
helen,Who is he?
mark,Me
helen,Of course it is!  Then who took this film?
mark, My Father.
helen,What a wonderful idea...
helen,You'll be able to show it to your own chi...
helen,You must have had a bad dream...
helen,"...but what was that light?  ...The camera, I suppose?"
helen,Whatever are you after?
helen,Naughty boy I hope you were spanked!
helen,"... but, Mark... what a strange thing for your father to photograph."
mark,Switch off?
helen,No.
helen,No.
tony,"Me, Mrs. Stephens?"
helen,I hate people who chatter in films - but there's so much I want to ask.
helen, Again?
helen,"Mark, this isn't some kind of jo..."
mark," No, Helen."
helen,"Mark, whatever is that?"
helen,What are you...
mark,wanted to photograph you... watching...
helen,"No, Mark!"
helen,No!
helen,help me to understand this... this nightmare...
helen,All right... now look... Mark - what was all that about?
helen,"... that was a lizard, wasn't it? Or a..."
mark,Liz...
helen,Well how did it get there?... How did it get there Mark?...  Was it a pet?
mark,Not mine...
helen,Won't you try to explain?
mark,You'd better go!
helen,I like to understand what I'm shown!
helen,What was your father trying to do?... Photographing you at nigh...
mark,better go...
helen,Mark... what is this?
mark,I am saying... goodbye... my mother...
helen, He... photographed... that...?
mark,Yes.
mark,...and this!
mark,...her funeral!
mark,...and this!
mark,...her burial!
mark,...and this!
helen,"Mark, who is that?"
mark,Her successor.
helen,Suc-?
mark,He married her... six weeks after... the previous sequence.
mark,She filmed... what comes now.
helen,Is that your father?
mark,The morning that he left for his honeymoon.
helen,What is he doing?
mark,Giving me a present...
helen,What was it?
mark,Can't you guess?
helen,Switch it off!
helen,"Switch it off, Mark!"
helen,So he was a scientist?
helen,"What kind of scientist, Mark?"
mark,Biologist.
helen,What was he trying to do to you?
helen,Mark!...
helen,What was he trying to do to you?
mark,Watch me... grow up...
mark,He wanted a record of a growing child... complete in every detail - if such a thing were possible - and he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me... at all times...
mark,I never knew... the whole of my childhood... one moment's privacy...
helen,And those lights in your eyes?... and that - thing?
mark,He was interested ... in the reactions of the nervous system... to fear...  Fear?
helen,Fear?
mark,Fear.
mark,I think he learned a lot... from me... I'd wake up... screaming... sometimes... and he'd be there... taking notes... and pictures... and I'm sure good came of it... for some people... He was brilliant.
helen,A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed - and good comes of it?
mark,I don't know... if he did... but if he did... he'll have learned something of value...
helen,If only about lizards!  Mark - it sounds to me as if your father was...
mark,He founded clinics.
helen,He sounds completely...
mark,He was famous! Professor A. N. Lewis... three clinics.
helen,Why do you still live in his house... and watch his films?
mark,They helped make me... what I am.
helen,"A photographer? It's no wonder, is it? But you still haven't shown me anything you've photographed!"
helen,Will you?
mark,One day...
tony,"Excuse me, but..."
tony,"Oh, there you are, Helen."
tony,"The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if..."
helen,I'm coming.
helen,I wish you'd join us.
mark,Thanks... work.
helen,I hope that you...
helen,... have a sweet tooth!
helen,Thank you... for my present.
tony,"Good night, old boy."
baden,OK. Print that one!
assistant director,"All right, everyone! Back at two!"
vivian,Mark?
mark,Hallo...
vivian,Were you spotted?
mark,Don't think so.
vivian, Is it tonight?
mark,Yes.
vivian,Mark...
mark,Yes?
vivian,You're sure we won't be caught?
mark,Not if you do as I tell you.
vivian,"I will, I promise."
mark,You haven't... said anything... to anyone?
vivian,Of course not.
mark,Good... like some cake?
vivian,Thank you.
vivian,Mark... I want to be quite clear about this...
vivian,"Tonight, when the studio's empty... I'm to come back-and you're going to give me a film test... right?"
mark,Right.
vivian,You'll then print the film - so I can show it to my agent and anyone else who matters - right?
mark,Right.
vivian,Mark...
vivian,I've been offered film tests before... but I haven't liked the terms.
mark,There aren't any.
vivian,Then why are you doing this? Risking your job and...
mark,Not just for you... Viv... I have an agent too - and I want to show him what I can do... I want to direct...
vivian, There's someone coming.
extra,"Hallo - lousy morning's work, wasn't it?"
vivian,Yes.
extra,Thought I saw you talking to somebody...
vivian,I was learning my lines.
extra,Didn't know you had any...
extra,Want a drink? Dutch?
vivian,Later... perhaps.
extra,Be seeing you
vivian,Mark...
mark,Yes?
vivian, You didn't mind me asking?
mark,"No, more cake?"
vivian,No... you want to direct... more badly than anything don't you?
vivian,"Don't you, Mark?"
mark,I want... to photograph... the impossible...
vivian,What is impossible?
mark,Something... that has never been photographed before.
vivian,What?
mark,You really want to know...?
vivian,"Very much, especially if there's a part for me."
mark,I want... to photograph a murder... while it's being committed.
vivian,No part for me then.
mark,But that... isn't enough.
vivian,Is this a new script?
mark,I want... to frighten... someone... to death... and photograph... their expression of fear...
vivian,Mark! What's this story called?
mark,That is something... he never photographed...
vivian,Who?
vivian,"Who is he, Mark?"
mark,Anyone.
vivian,No one could... they'd be caught!
mark,I wouldn't care... if I had my picture.
vivian,"Besides, how would you frighten anyone to death?"
mark,There's a way.
vivian,"Well, what?"
mark,There's a way.
vivian,You'd better not tell me! I'll be scared to death tonight as it is!
vivian,Back on the set - shall I go first?
mark,Please.
vivian,What are you doing?
mark,Getting into practice.
vivian,See you tonight!
mark,See you tonight!
baden,Would you enquire if our leading lady is ready to start leading.
diane,"How are you, Sparks? Chippy? Bob?"
voices,"Hallo, Diane..."
diane,"How are you, Tom? Roger?"
voices,"Hallo, Diane..."
diane,"How are you, Phil?... Mark?"
mark,"Hallo, Miss Ashley."
diane," How are you, Pete...?"
voice,"Hi, Di!"
baden,"Darling, you've only been playing this part for three weeks, so in case you haven't yet had a chance to read the script..."
baden,... may I remind you that you're a girl with an irresistible impulse!
baden,"a kleptomaniac! Who cannot help stealing... Get inside her, Diane!... What - in all the world - do you most want to steal?"
diane,The limelight!
baden,We'll run the scene where you catch sight of the store detective and faint... Where's the girl who plays the bystander?
baden,How are you?
vivian,"Hallo, Diane..."
baden,Hit that floor with a thud!
jarvis,But is it commercial?
jarvis,Are those budgets ready? Well bring 'em in.
jarvis,There's an error!  The total should be a hundred and fifty thousand pounds fourteen shillings and sixpence - not thirteen and ninepence... That could mean the difference between profit and loss on a first feature!
miss simpson,"Sorry, D.J."
jarvis,Any units working late tonight?
miss simpson,"Only one, sir. Night exteriors on the lot. The Elephant with two..."
jarvis,That animal needs a stick of dynamite!
jarvis,Remind me to pay them a visit tonight.
miss simpson,"Yes, D.J."
jarvis,"Now, Miss Simpson... take a memo to all department heads..."
baden,"Again, please... and, darling..."
baden,"... just this once... will you please make an effort to forget that you're stunning, and try to look as if you're stunned...?"
diane,Say one kind word - and I would be!
assistant," Positions, everyone!"
diane,If I have to faint once more I shall faint!
baden,Cut! How was that?...  Mark?
baden,Print it!
assistant,"That's it, boys and girls . . . wrap it up! Night-night everyone! Baden puts his arm round Diane's shoulder."
baden,"How are you, darling?"
clapper boy,Catching the bus?
mark,Not tonight... meeting someone... for a drink.
clapper boy,Wanted to discuss the film at the Everyman... Tomorrow then?
mark,I hope so.
clapper boy,"Good night, Mark."
mark,Good night.
extra,"Greetings... lousy afternoon's work, wasn't it? Who wants a lift to town?"
extra,colleague's car... there's room for two on my lap - three at a pinch.
vivian,"No, thanks... I've a date... at the Local."
miss simpson,I'm to remind you to pay a surprise visit tonight to The Elephant with...
miss simpson,"Good night, D.J."
vivian, Mark...?
vivian,Mark...?
vivian,Mark...?
vivian,Mark!
vivian,Listen... we must...
vivian,Where are you?
vivian,You frightened me!
vivian,Now listen... they're working late on the lot.
mark,I know. They're branched off this stage - I'm using their juice.
vivian,We must call it off... someone's bound to see us.
mark,They might...  ... but they won't interrupt us while we're filming... I've put the red light on.
vivian,You've what?...
mark,Put the...
vivian,Then they'll know someone's here.
mark,They won't come in.
vivian,They'll wait outside... what's the difference?
mark,The difference is... a perfect film...
mark,... have waited... a long time... for this... and so have you ... no one... must interrupt it.
vivian,We'll be caught.
mark,What does that matter?
vivian,Matter!
mark,You stand to lose... a job as an extra... I stand to lose... nothing.
mark,...the results must be so perfect... that the risks don't count...
mark,So perfect... that even he ...  ... even he... would say...
vivian,Who Don Jarvis!?
vivian,Oh! He'd say:  Mark... if you're sure it's worth it?
mark,"It's time to find out, Viv..."
vivian,Come on! Get hot! 
mark,You belong there...
vivian,I do feel alone in front of it...  I suppose stars never do?
mark,They feel alone without it... 
mark,... and the great ones... feel alone... all the time...
vivian,"Then I'm great, boy! What is it you want me to act? "
vivian,Being frightened to death?
mark,You remembered?
vivian,Yes - and I'll have a go!
vivian,I've been wondering all the afternoon how you'd do it!  I'll bet you've thought of a wonderful twist! 
vivian,What are you doing?
mark,Building us a set.
vivian,Why not pull the studio down while you're about it? They can only hang you once.
mark,Exactly.
vivian,If only Don Jarvis could see me now!
vivian,If only I could see Don Jarvis now!
vivian,"I warn you, Mark - I'm hysterical... I'd rather act dying of laughter, if it's all the same to you..."
vivian, What are you doing?
mark,"Be patient, Viv... it's going to be worth it."
vivian,Oh well! I've stood alone in front of a studio camera! That's more than most have.
mark,Ever stood... behind one?
vivian,No.
mark,Help yourself.
vivian," I can see you, Mark... perfectly!"
mark,Good...
vivian,"Yes, sir! I'll bet I'm the best camerawoman in the business! . . . "
mark,I'll be back.
vivian,"Welcome, stranger!"
vivian,What are you doing?
mark,Photographing you photographing me...
vivian," Mark, you're brilliant..."
vivian,Lost you again!
mark,"I'm ready now, Viv..."
mark,"Go and stand on that cross, will you?"
vivian," Yes, sir, Mr. Director, sir."
vivian,Am I supposed to imagine someone is going to put me in there?
mark,"Yes, Viv..."
vivian,Mark - I hope I won't let you down... I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me - but... I just don't feel frightened! Wouldn't it be better if I just did my number?
mark, Later.
vivian,"Oh all right! I could do anything - I feel so relaxed - and that's due to you... You're so at home with that camera you make me feel at home too... you have it in you, boy!"
mark,"Ready, Viv?"
mark vivian, Well-I'll try -
mark vivian,"But what... would... frighten me to death?  Set the mood for me, Mark..."
mark,Well...
mark,Imagine someone... coming towards you... who's going to kill you - regardless of consequences...
vivian,A madman?
mark,Yes - but he knows it... and you don't... and just to kill you... isn't enough for him.
vivian,But how would he frighten me to?
mark,"Stay there, Viv... you're... just right."
vivian,I can't imagine what you've thought of!
jarvis,Smoking on duty!
jarvis,Come with me!
vivian,That..?
vivian,Yes... that would be frightening!
mark,But... there's something else...
vivian,Well? What is it?
vivian, That...?
vivian, Mark... take it...
vivian,... away!
vivian,MARK - YOU!
helen,What else can I read you?
helen,Certain.
helen,Is that your last tonight?
helen,Your last but one?
helen, Toss me double or nothing?
helen,"Bad luck, darling."
helen,The ceiling!
helen,Yes.
helen,"Yes, darling."
helen,He has a quality...
helen,... and I think he could help me.
helen,Yes...
helen,Yes?
helen," Mummy, what's worrying you?"
helen,What else?
helen,Don't you like Mark?
helen,You don't like him! Now why not?
helen,He's shy!
helen,Now darling.
helen,May I?
helen,Thank you.
helen,remember that you lost the toss.
helen,"Yes, darling?"
helen,Done!
mark,Who is it?
mark," Come in, Helen!"
helen,Mother heard you come in - so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed ...
helen,Are you sure this is conven...
helen,"Hallo, Mark..."
helen,I hope you don't mind - is it a tape-recorder?
mark,Yes.
helen,"I'm sure I'm being a nuisance... but, Mark, I very much want to..."
mark,Happy birthday.
helen,Mark! That's very sweet of you - but really.
mark,It isn't much... I don't know anything about... presents for twenty-one... but I saw it this morning... so... please.
helen, Thank you...
helen,It's beautiful...
mark,I like the design... More milk?
helen,"More?... No, thank you, Mark... and I really appreciate this... I'm going to put it on now."
helen,There?... Or there?...
mark,The first place...
helen,I think so too!...
helen,I am keeping you.
mark,No... I promise.
helen,"Mark, I'm here for some advice."
mark,From me?  Please...
helen,... I work in a public library - in the children's section... I'm telling you that to postpone admitting what always embarrasses me...
helen,In my spare time... I write.
mark,What's embar...
helen,I write stories for children... but so did Grimm... Hans Andersen... Lewis Carroll...
mark,Had any published?
helen,Some short stories.
mark,I'd like to read...
helen,I learned today... that my first book... has been accepted! ... For publication in the spring...
mark,But that's wonderful... what's it about?
helen,A magic camera - and what it photographs...
mark,Whatever made you... think of that?
helen,I'll tell you one day - I promise...
mark,Well what does it photograph?
helen,"I'll tell you that too - but, Mark... this is the problem... The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes - but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and suggest drawings... but I don't agree."
mark,No - nothing's impossible.
helen,"was hoping you'd say that! There must be photographs - however difficult to take - and I was wondering, Mark - if you'd..."
mark,Oh yes.
helen,discuss it with me.
mark,take them.
helen,Mark - I can't ask you to do that...
helen,I mean... the publisher's mightn't agree.
mark,I'd take them... for you.
helen,Yes but... the money.
mark,There are some things... which I photograph... for nothing.
helen,I didn't mean to offend you.
mark,Offend?
mark,Helen... if you knew what it meant... for something to happen to me... that I don't have to make happen... it's like... you've given me a twenty-first birthday...
mark,What does your camera photograph?
helen,Mark - I must go... I just wanted to know... if you'd talk it over with me.
mark,When please?
helen,That's up to you.
mark,Helen ... I don't know much about... dinner out... but would you come with me?
helen,Thank you.
mark,Thank you.
helen,When?
mark,Oh...
helen,What's the matter?
mark,It had better be soon...
helen,Are you going away?
mark,Almost for certain! ...
helen,Oh... well you suggest when.
mark,Are you free... tomorrow night?
helen,Yes.
mark,I hope I am!
helen,I'll understand if you're not.
mark,I'll try to be - I'll try my hardest to be.
helen,Thank you for listening... and for my present.
mark,and for mine.
helen,"Good night, Mark... "
mark,Good night... Helen...
man's voice,Looking for a trunk?
baden,No - no - no - we must get some comedy into this...!
baden,We'll retake it this morning...
diane, I'll take it.
baden,I want some comedy in this scene...
baden,"Instead of taking the first trunk you see, I want you, darling... to ask for a blue trunk - and when he brings it to you, to ask for a red one - and when he brings that, to ask for a white one...  And you, Michael... get the trunks one by one - growing more and more fed up - and we'll end on a gag which I'll think of in a minute - all right?"
diane,I don't feel it!
baden,Don't feel it! Do it!
assistant director," Positions, everyone!"
assistant director,Anyone seen Vivian?
baden,Who?
assistant director,The red-headed bystander - Viv.
baden, Never mind - I'm cutting her out of this scene... Let's run it.
assistant director," Quiet, everyone!"
assistant,Can I interest you in a trunk?
diane,Thank you...  I'd like to see that one...
assistant,"Certainly, madam..."
assistant director,It's beautifully fitted - 
diane,I'd like to see one in red.
assistant,"Certainly, madam."
diane,... do you have one in white?
assistant,"Certainly, madam."
baden,The silly bitch! She's fainted in the wrong scene...
sergeant miller,"Excuse me, Chief."
chief inspector,Mm?
sergeant miller,We pass my house when we reach the bypass. Would you mind if I drop off for a minute?
chief inspector, To collect your kid's autograph book?
sergeant miller,"Yes, Chief!... If the nipper hears where I've been..."
chief inspector, ... and it's about time the Sergeant helped me - we're getting nowhere with this.
sergeant,What about that man the landlady passed?
chief inspector,She couldn't describe him - except to say that he was carrying something that she couldn't see.
sergeant,That's a help.
chief inspector,"Sergeant, I've been on the force thirty odd years... and I have never seen such fear on anyone's face as on this girl's...  What was it she saw?"
sergeant,"Surely, Chief... a man coming at her - with a sharp weapon."
chief inspector,I'm familiar with that kind of terror. This is something new to me... but what?
chief inspector,...now take a look at how we found her.
assistant director,Till the police arrive... D.J.'s orders.
assistant,and when she opened that trunk... and I saw what was inside... my dears - I nearly fainted with her -  and do you know what horrified me most?
assistant director,D.J. says not to discuss it.
assistant,Any more sauce from D.J. and I shall refuse to sign for seven years! My dears... that poor girl's expression.
sergeant," Chief, it's exactly the..."
inspector,"I know...  Well, sir... we shall probably have to interview everyone at the studio, so we'd better plan a campaign that won't interfere too much with your productions."
jarvis," Thank you, Chief Inspector... if you knew what even a single day's delay could cost."
inspector,"Oh, we do sir. "
jarvis,The police wish to interview each of you individually... after which you will be at liberty to leave.
jarvis,"There will, of course, be no shooting today... but work will be resumed, as usual, tomorrow... with, I hope, all of you present."
jarvis,I look to you to give the police your fullest cooperation. 
sergeant miller,"Well now... let's get ourselves organized...  We don't want to keep you cooped up in here, so we've worked out a timetable... We'll talk to the artists first, then the technicians in this order..."
extra,...she said she didn't want a lift - because she had a call to make locally.
chief inspector,Did she say where?
extra,"No, sir... and when I left, she was still in the dressing room."
chief inspector,"I see... let's have a look at this dressing room, shall we?"
extra,"Yes, sir ..."
girl,"Hallo, Mark..."
sergeant,"Hey, I don't think you ought to do that!"
mark,"Sorry, sir."
inspector, Do what?
sergeant,Make me famous. Some chap was giving me a screen test
voice,And whoever did it must be...
chief cameraman,You're next.
clapper boy,I've been watching you...
mark,Oh?
clapper boy,Have you been filming those policemen?
mark,"Yes, I've a few quite interesting shots of them - it's a chance I never expected!"
clapper boy,A chance for what?
mark,To photograph... an investigation... or as much of it as I can.
clapper boy,What on earth for?
mark,It will complete a documentary I'm making.
clapper boy,documentary?
clapper boy,What's it about?
mark,I'd rather not tell you till it's finished. And it soon will be ...
clapper boy,But suppose they catch you?
mark,Oh they will - they look very efficient.
clapper boy,Don't you mind?
mark,No.
clapper boy,But they might confiscate your camera.
mark,I'm afraid they will! But by then... I'll have finished with it.
clapper boy,I don't...
mark,Thanks...
clapper boy,"Mark, hadn't you better leave that with me?"
mark,"No, John."
clapper boy,I'd look after it.
mark,I'm sure of that - but I'd like to photograph them while they're questioning me.
mark,I don't suppose they'll let me.
clapper boy,"Mark, are you potty?"
mark,"Yes, do you think they'll notice?"
clapper boy,Don't get into any trouble for heaven's sake  I want to discuss that film at the Everyman...
mark,Yes... I'd like that...
sergeant,Mark Lewis - focus-puller... Whatever that may be?
sergeant,Come in.
inspector,Mr. Lewis?
mark,"Yes, sir..."
inspector,I'm Chief Inspector Gregg and this is Sergeant Miller. Grab a chair.
sergeant,Ah! My photographer.
mark,I've brought the camera in case you want to take the film away.
inspector,"That's all right, Mr. Lewis - as long as we don't appear at the Odeon next week in place of the cartoon."
mark,"Thank you, sir."
inspector,Well now; have you anything to tell us?
mark,"Don't think so, sir."
inspector,Did you know the girl?
mark,"Yes, sir..."
inspector,How well?
mark,Mainly by sight.
inspector,When did you see her last?
mark,Yesterday afternoon - when we broke...
inspector,Speak to her?
mark,Called out good night - don't know if she heard?
inspector,What did you do then?
mark,"Took sqme shots, sir - for a film I'm making."
inspector,Oh... where?
mark,"All over the place, sir... it's a documentary."
inspector,Anyone with you?
mark,"No, sir. Just my camera."
inspector,"What time did you arrive home, Mr. Lewis?"
mark,About ten... ten-thirty...
inspector,Anyone see you?
mark,Yes... the people downstairs.
inspector,I see.
sergeant,"Sergeant Miller - Right, I'll tell him..."
sergeant,The doctor's finished his examin...
sergeant,...wants to see you -
inspector,"Right.  That'll be all for the moment, Mr. Lewis - thank you."
mark," Thank you, sir ..."
inspector,Wait a minute.
inspector,"direct me to that set of yours, will you? I'd probably end on location."
mark,"I'll take you there, sir. "
inspector,"Thanks.  Carry on with the interviews, Sergeant."
sergeant,"Yes, sir."
clapper boy, I warned him to be careful!
inspector,I think I can find my way now...
inspector,...thanks for the escort
doctor,...still cannot determine - but look!
inspector,"Quiet, everyone.  Please..."
detective,I thought I heard a putty cat!
inspector,"I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands, and if we don't get him quickly there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the Commissioner. So let's hurry things up, shall we?"
detective,"Sorry, Chief!"
helen,"she was appearing in Arthur Baden's new film The Walls Are Closing In, starring Diane Ashley."
helen,"a spokesman at the studio said that her performance in the film showed such promise, that her role was to have been built up... All work at the studio ceased today as a tribute to her memory!"
helen,"Yes, darling... It is reliably..."
helen,I'll ask him tonight...
helen,If he's free.
helen,I've no idea - and I don't suppose he has...
helen,I'll ask him.
helen,I'll bring him in and introduce you if...
helen,Now how can you?
helen,How did you know where he was standing?
helen,Hallo...
mark,Free?
helen,Yes.
mark,Good! So am I...
helen,I'd like you to come in for a moment - and meet my mother.
mark,"Yes, please..."
mark,Yes...  ... didn't want to be late for Helen.
helen,"Thank you, Mark - You deserve a drink for that! What would you like?"
mark,Nothing - thank you... very much...
helen,"Darling, I've left your supper in the..."
mark,"No - No, I didn't..."
mark,The station.
helen,"Darling, may I tell you about your supper?"
mark,I hope so - Goodbye... 
helen,"Darling, we forgot to toss."
helen,Supper's laid out in the kitchen.
helen,"We'll be early! Good night, darling."
helen,Mark...
mark,"Yes, Helen?"
helen,I want to ask you something rather personal...
helen,How long is it since you've gone out without that?
mark,Without what?
helen,Your camera...
mark,Oh...
mark,I... don't think I know?
helen,Exactly. I've never seen you without it... but are you going to need it tonight?
helen,Well are you? And if so... shall I bring some work with me too?
mark,I'm not going to need it tonight!
helen,Good - then give it to me!
helen,...It'll be quite safe - I'll put it away for you.
mark, No!
helen,Then take it upstairs - if you can't trust me with it...
mark,I trust you.
helen,Then look...
helen,...let's put it in here.
helen,Come in - and see for yourself.
helen,We'll put it in here - and lock it.
mark,This... was my mother's room.
helen,"Was it, Mark?..."
helen,"I am being tactless, aren't I? ... It's just that... I thought it was growing into an extra limb, and - but you bring it with you if you want to."
helen,Thank you...
mark,You...
helen,Thank you.
mark,I feel...
helen,Yes?
mark,Can't describe it! Could only photograph it -
helen,Shall I tell you what I feel?
mark,Yes.
helen,Famished!
mark,Good!
mark,There's a small place round the corner... It's awfully good on Christmas Day.
helen,Is it?
mark,Yes... there aren't too many open then.
helen,No - it sounds fun.
mark,This way.
helen,I adore new restaurants...
helen,Where is this restaurant?
mark,Round the corner...
helen,Come on then...
mark,Thank you.
tony,Oh!
tony,Oh!
tony,Well I...
tony,Well...
tony,"No, I..."
tony,"Chipperfield, I suppose..."
tony,Certainly... and then I must go to my room.
helen,I like this place! And this dinner!
helen,"...thank you, Mark..."
mark,Are you ready to talk about your book?
helen,I'm ready to talk about you...
helen,It won't take a second - and it's best to have it said.
helen,"Carrying a camera is only one of your habits, isn't it, Mark?"
helen,"... when you stared at that couple, you were like the little boy on that film you showed me... looking over the wall at something he shouldn't see. But Mark - you're strong enough now to lift that child off the wall... aren't you?"
helen,... aren't you?
mark,I'll try to be.
helen,"Will you, Mark?... Will you really?"
mark,Yes...
helen,Lecture finished...
mark,When your book's published - will you go on working in a library?
helen,"Yes, Mark... in case, one day, a child comes in and asks for it!"
mark,I'll come in.
helen,I'm not popular with my customers! They ask me for horror comics - and I take their sticky hands and drag them to where there are books!
helen,"... and do you know, Mark, waiting for them to come in next time and ask for books... is as exciting... as a horror comic..."
mark,What does your magic camera photograph?
helen,People...
mark,Yes?...
helen,It's owned by a little boy who is terrified of grown-ups... but when he looks in his magic camera he sees grown-ups as they were when they were children... and he isn't frightened any longer.
helen,... and one day he gives his camera away to a little boy who is even more frightened of grown-ups than he was - and do you know what he finds?
helen,... that when he looks at grown- ups without his camera he can still see them as they were when they were children!  And that means that he's grown up himself...
mark,What made you think of this story?
helen,You did!
helen,... I looked out of my window - and saw you going off to work carrying that camera like a little boy with a satchel... and an idea came... so thank you...
mark,I'd like to think... I was responsible... in some way...
helen,Now what do I do about the photographs?
mark,Take 'em!
mark,Oh!
mark,There isn't a single face that doesn't look like a child's - not a single one - if you catch it at the right moment.
mark,It would be a challenge!... Unlike anything I've photographed!
helen,"What have you photographed, Mark?"
mark,Everything. But nothing I'd want children to see.
mark,"But this would belong to them - and they'd know if it wasn't right... Oh, Helen... I would like to find those faces for you... with you..."
helen,Very well! Let's try!
mark,You made a promise to your mother -
helen," Yes, Mark..."
mark,You'd better keep it.
helen,Thank you...
helen,"Mother must have gone to bed.  Mark, it was a wonderful evening..."
mark,That's what I was going to say... a wonderful evening...
helen, And you made it wonderful... without your camera.
helen, I'll get it for you.
helen,wonder how this sees grown-ups? 
mark,Not you! 
helen,Mark.
mark,It never will... see you!
helen,Why not?
mark,Whatever I photograph -
helen,Yes?
mark,I always - lose...
helen,I don't understand.
helen,He'll wake Mother!
helen,"... thank you, again, for my evening.  Will you go to bed now - and not stop up watching those films?"
mark,Well... I've a little work to do... then I'll go to bed... and think of how to find faces for you...
mark,...faces which - are faces which...
helen,"Good night, Mark..."
mark,...how did you?
mark,"I was never allowed a key..., can't get used to them."
mark,I brought her home early.
mark,Is there something you...
mark,Next door would be more...
mark,Visit?
mark,I've no one to talk to... in the rooms I live over...
mark,It's a changing bag... we put films in it - so that the light won't spoil them...
mark,You'd know at once -
mark,Yes.
mark, It's no good - I was afraid it wouldn't be.
mark,The lights failed too soon.
mark,I'll have to try again.
mark,An opportunity... now I must find another.
mark,Please let me finish! It's for Helen!
mark,She wants to see something I've photographed!
mark,Yes!
mark,It's late.
mark,You must be tired...
mark,No... thank you.
mark,Run out of film.
mark,I'll never photograph her... I promise you that.
mark,You'll never have to move... because of me... I promise you.
mark,taking my picture?
mark,It's been a long time... since anyone did...
mark,"Good night, Mrs. Stephens."
jarvis,"Have you any suspicions, Chief Inspector?"
inspector,It could be any of them...
sergeant,That's the trouble with film people - they're all peculiar...  ... present company excepted.
publicity man,Speaking of peculiar people.
publicity man,We've a psychiatrist coming down today. Dr Rosen -
inspector,I know him.
publicity man,It's pure publicity - and I promise he won't do any work.
inspector,What will he do?
publicity man,Get himself photographed... We're telling the press he's here to help the case - and to see if he can spot the murderer.
sergeant,And the best of luck!
jarvis,Do you object. Chief Inspector?
inspector,No...
inspector,"I'll be frank. I'd welcome anyone's help... I don't know how this maniac kills - or why he kills - or who he'll kill next, but if he isn't caught quickly... "
baden,"Inspector, have you convinced yourself he's a member of my unit?"
inspector,"No, sir ... but a few things seem to point to it... No one outside your unit admits to knowing the girl... There was a trunk all ready for her... and with the risks he was running, I think he'd have to use surroundings he was familiar with... Where is your unit now?"
baden,Waiting for me on the set.
inspector,"I'd like to watch them at their jobs, sir. It may tell me more than a hundred interviews."
baden,"But, Inspector, the strain on them is already..."
jarvis,"Come now, Arthur, if that's what the Inspector wants."
inspector,"I'm afraid it is, sir... now where could I get the best view?"
baden, On the dolly... the camera... You can watch everyone and everything from there... including me!
inspector,"Very well, sir ... I'll become a member of your camera crew..."
baden, ... if the unions don't object!
voice 1,I hear they're making an arrest today.
voice 2,hope it's D.J. It's about time they caught up with him!
driver,"We're there, Doctor."
doctor, Dr Rosen!  What a pity.
baden,"Try it, darling... We'll all be with you."
assistant director," Quiet, everyone. Let's run it!"
doctor,Terribly sorry.
assistant cameraman,That sneezer geezer's a psychiatrist!... Heard it on the grapevine.
assistant director," All right, everyone - let's run it..."
diane,I'd like to see... that one...
diane,... have you it... in red...?
assistant,"Certainly, madam."
diane,"... in... red  I can't! I can't, Arthur!"
assistant director,"Ten minutes break, everyone!"
assistant director,"Can you suggest anything, Doctor?"
doctor,No. It looked jolly interesting to me.
assistant director,I mean to help her psychologically...
doctor,Yes. Give the girl a proper rest... Ten minutes is useless!
assistant director," Thank you, Doctor."
doctor,What's your job?
mark,I'm a focus-puller...
doctor,"Oh... so am I, in a way."
mark,I was wondering if you knew my father - Professor Lewis...
doctor,Professor... but of course I knew him. He lectured to me.
doctor,He was an extraordinary man - quite brilliant!
mark,You know what he was interested in before he died?
doctor,No? Tell me...
mark,I don't remember what he called it... It was something to do with what causes people to be... peeping Toms...
doctor,Scoptophilia!... That would interest him! A most fertile mind.
mark,Scopto...?
doctor,philia... The morbid urge to gaze... Coined since his day... Have you any manuscripts of his which I could...?
mark,He thought... it could be cured...
doctor,Usually. Now about his manuscripts -
mark,Quickly?
doctor,The cure? Very quick... A couple of years analysis - three times a week - an hour a time - and it's soon up-rooted...
doctor,... if you've any of his papers on the subject?
mark,"Yes, Doctor..."
doctor,"I'd like to see them - I'll give you my address, young man."
sergeant,Wonder what all that's about?
inspector,"We'll find out afterwards... Now, listen... I want you to watch who brings their own lunches... Someone ate homemade cakes and sandwiches by the side of those bushes - and we may get a lead."
sergeant,"Right, sir."
assistant director,"We're stopping at four today - so have a quick lunch, everyone! Back at two sharp!"
voice,"Hey, Mark!"
clapper boy,Can't wait to show you this!  I ought to charge you!
mark,You've given me... an idea...
clapper boy,I'll bet I have!
clapper boy,Hey! Where are you going?
mark,Phone - may be my last chance - and... thanks.
clapper boy,But your lunch?
mark,You have it!
clapper boy,... some photograph! Well lit too!
mark,"Can't manage Saturday, sir, but they're letting us off early today! This afternoon - after work - may be my last chance!"
mark,Six o'clock...
mark,"I'll be there, sir."
mark,"Hallo? Is that the Public Library? ... You have a Miss Helen Stephens employed there?  Yes... can you tell me if her name is spelt with a V or a PH, I want to send her a tic-PH? ... Thank you."
clapper boy,They're waiting!
doctor rosen,He asked if I knew his father... which I did... a brilliant man!
inspector,Is that all he wanted?
doctor,think so... we had a little chat about scoptophilia - and he's going to show me...
inspector,About what?
doctor,Voyeurism.
inspector,Eh?
doctor,"What makes people into Peeping Toms, one of his father's subjects, apparently."
inspector, Peeping Toms...
doctor,"An interesting boy... he has his father's eyes... you don't suspect him, do you?"
inspector,I suspect 'em all - what about you?
doctor,I'm interested in that chap with the bald head and hatchet face... there's something on his mind!
inspector,No wonder... he's the director!
assistant director,"All right, everyone. This is the last shot... Make it a good one!"
inspector," Got your list, Sergeant?"
sergeant," YES, SIR."
inspector,I want to see how some of them spend their spare time...
sergeant,"Which ones, sir?"
inspector,"Exactly, Sergeant...  ... which ones?"
mark,"I won't, sir."
mark,"Right, sir."
milly,"You've spoiled my whole evening, you have!"
mark,"Sorry, Milly."
milly,What's the idea?
mark,I shan't be here tomorrow. 
milly,Why? Going on manoeuvres with the boy scouts?
mark,I thought so!
milly,Have you gone absolutely...
mark,I'm just... completing a documentary.
milly,"You're a document and a half, you are. Is it safe to be alone with you?"
milly,... might be more fun if it wasn't...
helen,Darling...
helen,Darling.
tony,Hallo.
helen,"Hallo, Tony..."
tony,Where are you going?
helen,To leave something for Mark...
tony,You haven't much time for me these days.
helen,Tony...
tony,It's all right - I'll be here - if you want me.  ... by the way... your mother was yelling out something before you came in... about Mark photographing her.
helen,Photographing Mother? You must be mistaken!
tony,Of course. See you sometime.
helen,Mark...?
helen,Mark?  No answer. She looks thoughtfully at the envelope in her hand - then goes in to the dark-room.
detective,"... don't know what to make of it, sir ... He went to a library, a solicitor's office, and a newsagent's shop - private photography there, if you ask me. Shall I hang around outside the house, sir? Don't think so, either... All right, sir, I'll give you the details when I get back... Bye, sir. "
chief inspector,Chief Inspector Gregg! What?  Put him on the line...
chief inspector,"Yes, yes... What's the address? ... Newsagent's shop? ... Did you say news...?"
mark,"Don't let me see you... frightened...  Hurry, Helen!"
helen,Not...
mark,Leave!
helen,Not...  ... till I know...
mark,Now!
helen,That film...
helen,That film...
helen,... is ... just a film...
helen,... isn't it?
helen,... horrible ... horrible... but... just a film... isn't it?
mark,No...  And now that you know... I want you with me... a while.
mark,"You'll be safe - as long as I can't see you frightened - so stand in the shadows, Helen... please..."
mark,... please...
helen,She's right... your mother... must tell someone everything... sorry... has to be you!
helen,This was his laboratory... and you know some of what he did... but not all.
mark,... aged five...
mark,... aged seven...
mark,All the rooms were wired for sound... and... still are.
mark,Your room.
mark,Your mother's .
mark,Tony's.
tony,But darling...
helen, Turn it off!
helen,"Look at me, Mark!"
mark,Not if you're frightened...
helen,Look at me!
helen,What did you do... to those girls?
mark,No.
helen,"What did you do, Mark...?"
helen,If you want to torment me... for the rest of my life... then make me imagine!
helen,What did you do ... to those girls?
mark,Can't...
helen,"Show me, Mark..."
mark,But if you're frightened...
helen,Show me - or I'll remain frightened... for the rest of my life.  Show me!
mark,It's fear.
mark,So I did something... very simple...
mark,Very simple.
mark,When they felt the spike... touching their throats... and knew I was going to kill them...
mark,... I made them - watch their own deaths!
mark,"Made them see their own terror as the spike went in... and if death has a face, they saw that too!"
mark,Not you! Not you! I'll never photograph you! I promised - I promised - Not you!
helen,... frightened ... for you...
sergeant,Look out!
helen,Mark! Mark! Give yourself up!
mark,I've been ready for this... for such a long time...
helen,What are you...
mark,It'll be all right.
mark,I can beat that!
helen,Give yourself up... Mark!
mark,"Watch them, Helen... Watch them say goodbye - one by one -  I've timed this... so often..."
helen,No - No!
mark,I wish... I could have found your faces for you...
mark,Helen - I'm afraid!
mark,I'm glad I'm afraid!
