Speaker,Dialogue
ray,Just give him toast.
ray,Listening for the trucks.
ray,Yeah.
ray,"I don't know how he found it, T.J."
ray,I locked it in my glove compartment.
ray,"Yeah, I see that now, but the trucks were coming before the bank opened."
ray,"Duh? No, I guess he just sniffed it out."
ray,He hasn't bought a scratch card in almost thirty two months. I thought it would be okay!
ray,Nothing.
ray,He could be anywhere.
ray,Where?
ray,"With more than four thousand dollars, he's probably in Atlantic City by now."
ray,I can't.
ray,I just can't do it anymore.
ray,"T.J., we can't make him stop."
ray,"It's not stealing if you take it from your family. Anyway, he made some of it, too."
ray,I'm sorry.
ricky,Is it here?
ray,"Hey, little sleepy head."
ricky,Is it here yet? `Cause I'm ready.
ray,Wait a sec-
ray,We're all ready for ya'.
versailles,We'll need the balloon payment to unload.
ray,"We have it, it's just that they called Troy from Titus last night. That's where Troy works. The ski place? And anyway-"
versailles,"Have you got the $4,372 dollars or not?"
ray,It was some emergency with the lifts. So he took off without thinking with the money. Completely forgot you were coming. So as soon as he gets back-
versailles,When's he gonna be back?
ray,"As soon as he can get here, I'll just run it down to you."
versailles," This is the second time you've dragged me out here. If you don't come up with it by Christmas, you've lost your fifteen hundred dollar deposit."
ray,"Look, Mr. Versales, I have a good job at ALL FOR A DOLLAR. They're probably gonna make me a manager after Christmas so I can handle the payments if you just leave the house- "
versailles,Call me when you have the balloon payment.
ray,I'll call you...
ricky,"Wait, where are they going?"
ray,Listen to me. We'll get them back.
ricky,But why are they leaving?
ray,"Ricky, I'll get them back. I promise, honey."

ray,You're going to school.
ricky,Where's daddy?
ray,He'll be back.
ray,No! I'm going to work and you're going to school.
ray,The only thing that changed is that your dad started gambling again. Everything else is the same.
ricky,Where did he go?
ray,He had to take a business trip.
ray,And miss a day of work? No. Not again. We just have to live our lives. Now go get your backpack.
ricky,When is daddy coming home?
ray,"I don't know, Ricky."
ray,Where? Where do I look? 
ray,"I told you, he could be in Atlantic City by now."
ray,You're going to school.
ray, Matt. Could I talk to you?
matt,I see you as a short timer.
ray,What is that?
matt,"A short timer. Not here for long, not really committed."
ray,When I started you said it would be six months before I could come on full-time. And that was two years ago.
matt,It's my opinion.
ray,"Well, I mean, you know, I do show up. Pat's late everyday. She's late now. She's always late."
mohawk teenager,Fill it up?
ray,"Just three...uh, no...two seventy one, two, three, four."
mohawk teenager,Two seventy four.
ray, Make that seven seventy four.
mohawk teenager,"Blue Acclaim...no, but I only worked until 9 PM. You can ask inside."

ticker taker,It's $5 dollars for admission.
ray,"I don't want to play, I just need to look around for a second."
ticket taker,I'm gonna need the five.
ray,I'll stand right here at the door. I won't even go inside. I just need to see if my husband's in there.
ticket taker,You still gotta pay admission.
ray,He's gambling away the money for our house.
ticket taker,What does he look like?
ray,Long brown hair. Tall. Skinny. Ponytail.

ticket taker,"I told you, lady, he's not in there."
ray,Hey!
ray,That's my car.
lila,Huh?
ray, What are you doing with my car?
lila,That? I found it.
ray,You stole it.
lila,The keys were in it.
ray,So you just took it...?
ray, You can cut the bullshit and give me my keys now.
lila, The Tribal police don't like people shooting holes in other people's houses.
ray,This is New York State so quit the bullshit and give me my damn keys!
lila,This camper belongs to my brother in law. He won't like this.
ray, Then you should quit stealing cars.
lila,"I thought it was abandoned, the guy driving it got on a bus."
ray,Did you see where the bus was headed?
lila,"New York or Buffalo, I'm not sure."
ray, Shit!
lila, I got a friend who might buy that.
ray,It's not for sale.
lila,He'll pay more than it's worth.
ray,Why's that?
lila,He's always looking for cars with button- release trunks.
ray,Does he use them to rob banks or something?
lila,All I know is he pays good for a car like this.
ray,Where does he live?
lila,Through the woods. Not far.
ray,What's in it for you?
lila,He'll give me something for finding it.
ray,"If you try anything, I'm not afraid to use this."
lila,Yeah.
lila,Turn up there.
ray,Where?
lila,Where that stump is.
ray, There's no road.
lila,There's a path.
lila,Not too fast. There's ruts.
ray,I'm not crossing that!
lila,Don't worry they already put out the Christmas trees. There's no black ice.
ray,That's Canada.
lila,"No, it's Mohawk land. The Rez is on both sides of the river."
ray,What about the border patrol?
lila,There's no border.
ray,I'm still not crossing that.
lila,"Don't worry, it'll hold a Plymouth. I've seen semis cross it."
ray, This is so fuckin' stupid.
lila,"Not too fast, there are ruts."
lila,You gotta pick up some speed to get up the bank.
lila,Honk the horn.
jimmy,Thunder! SHUT UP!.
lila,"Hi, Jimmy."
jimmy,"He don't like whites, Lila."

lila,Just back up.
ray,I'm not moving until those people get out of my trunk.
lila,I'll give you half. Now let's go.
ray,I'm not taking them over the border. That's a crime.
lila,There's no border here. This is free trade between nations.
ray,This isn't a nation.
lila, Let's go.
lila,Why'd your husband leave you?
ray,Fuck you.
lila,Maybe he wanted a younger women.
lila,Keep going.
ray,What if the troopers stop us.
lila,They won't stop you. You're white.

lila,Turn down there.
ray,You can't have my car.
lila,Get out.
ray,You can't have my car.
ray,I told you not to use that thing when I'm not here.
ray,I don't care. Don't use that thing when I'm not here!
ray,No.
ray,At the bus stop on the Rez.
ray,You don't know that.
ray,And then what? Chase him across the country. Miss work. No.
ray,Nothin'.
ray,It was no big deal.
ray,Some Indian chick tried to steal your Dad's car.
ray,It doesn't matter.

mike,"Come on, Lila."
lila,What?! I've been saving up.
mike,You know what.
lila,Does Bernie Littlewolf run your whole life?
mike,"No, but he said not to sell you a car."
lila,I gotta walk down 37 with the semis kickin' up snow and mud in my hair just to get to the work.
mike,"For you, all I got are two Chevettes,a Horizon and a Civic."
lila,I don't like Chevettes.
mike,I figured.
lila,I'll give you a thousand for the Malibu.
mike,Nothing with a trunk.
lila,That thing has been sittin' here for six months.
mike,I don't want Bernie in my face. Okay?
lila,He doesn't have to know.
ricky,"Mommy, I was thinking. What's gonna happen to the tin crapper when we get our new house?"
ray, They're gonna flatten it out and send it to China.
ricky,Then what?
ray,They're gonna melt it down and make little toys out if it.
ricky,Then what?
ray,They'll send them back here so I can sell them at All for a Dollar.
ricky,And you can buy me some?
ray,That's right.
ricky,Yes!
ray,We just have to make it to my paycheck on Friday.
ray,What about them?
ray,You told me that already.
ray, Who's Mitch.
ray,He sells pot to kids?
ray,"You're fifteen, it's not gonna happen so forget it."
ray,Your job is looking after your brother. Who's gonna take care of him?
ray, I want my part.
lila,I'll give you the money if you give me the car.
ray,No way.
lila,The money's gone.
ray,Then I wanna get some more of those Chinese.
lila,It's gonna cost me to get that hole fixed. I froze last night.
ray,I just need enough for the balloon payment on my doublewide then I'm out of this. I'm no criminal.
lila,It's not a crime.
ray,You people can call it what you want to. I just want my double.
lila,I don't usually work with whites.
ray,Suit yourself.
lila,How many bedrooms?
ray,Three. I got kids.
lila,How old?
ray,Five and Fifteen.
lila,I got a boy. Almost one.

lila,Tribal police don't get involved in stuff like that.
jimmy,Bernie was askin' if I'd seen you. I told him no.
lila,Thanks.
jimmy,"I don't want any trouble with him, Lila."
lila,Don't worry about it.
jimmy,This guy's been calling all morning. He's got two up at the Old Casino.
lila,Okay.
ray,What's going on?
lila,We gotta pick them up.
ray, Where?
lila,Not far.
ray,Where's that?
lila,An old casino through the woods. They used to have gambling there in the bootlegger days.
ray,What the hell is he doing?
lila,Keep that thing down.
ray,What the hell is going on here?
lila,Just roll it down.
bruno, D'ey don't like de women driver.
lila,Count it.
ray,Twelve hundred.
lila,Open it.
bruno,D'is will keep d'em from running.
ray,Why would they want to run?
lila,To get away from the snakeheads.
ray,What's that?
lila,The snakeheads pay to get them here and then they gotta work off what they owe .
ray,How much does it cost?
lila,"Forty, fifty thousand. Depends where they're coming from."
ray,To get here?
lila,Sometimes they gotta work for years to pay it off.
ray, To get here? No fuckin' way.
lila,They always stink.
ray,Are they always there?
lila,"Yeah, but they can't stop you unless you give them a reason."
ray,Have you ever gotten caught?
lila,Once.
ray,What happened?
lila,They gave me the choice of paying a fine or spending three months in jail.
ray,What did you do?
lila,"I paid the fine. I made the money back in two nights of smuggling. But back then it was cigarettes and everybody did it. Some of the troopers were into it, too."
ray,Smuggling?
lila,Yeah. But when they lowered the tax on cigarettes in Canada most people got out of it and the rest switched over to Chinese.
lila,Count it.
ray,"Right, I know."
lila,"Well, be sure it's right. I don't wanna get stiffed."
ray,Then why don't you count it?
lila,I got bad eyes.
ray,You're welcome.
lila,What about mine?
ray,We're even now.

ricky,Mommy!
ray, Who wants to go the Price Chopper and get some Cap'n Crunch?
ricky,I DO!
ray,Wanna to go to the Price Chopper?
ray, Matt made me an assistant manager.
ray,Is that so hard to believe?
ray,"Exactly, and that's why he gave me a bonus."
evelyn,"Chance! Chance, get in here before you freeze your ass off."
ray,What?
ray,"What is it, again?"
ray,"-Hot Wheels Tech Trax, what?"
ray,I got something even better than that.
ray,"The double wide. But don't mention it to Ricky, just in case."
ray,This time is for real.
ray,"Yes it is. We're getting a tub, T.J. It's gonna happen."
ray,If you keep that attitude I'll never let you use it.
ray,What about him?
ray,"Why, did he call broke yet?"
ray,"Oh, here we go again with Saint Dad."
ray,"He's an addict, T.J."
ray,You gotta help Ricky get the tree up tomorrow after school okay?

lila,"They're ""Pakis."""
ray,What does that mean?
lila,They're from Pakistan.
ray,Well where's that?
lila,I don't know. What difference does it make?
ray,A big difference.
lila,If we wait much longer we won't be able to get back across the river.
ray,"Look, I'm not driving just anybody across the border."
lila,Do you want the money or not?
ray,I wanna know what's in the bag.
lila,They don't understand you.
ray,"Well, if they want to come over here so bad, they ought'a take the time to learn English."
ray,I'll take that.
lila,If we keeps snowing like this we won't be able to get across the river.
ray,I just hope these aren't the ones that blow up themselves and everybody with them.
lila,We don't have time.
lila,Is that a two or a five?
ray, A five.
lila,You gotta stop so I can fill up the wiper fluid.
ray,I'm not stoppin'.
lila,It's a hundred feet deep out here if we get on black ice
ray,"Nuclear power, poison gas,...you can't tell what they might have in there. I'm not gonna be responsible for that."
ricky,"Hey T.J., watch this!"
dealer, They say there's a bag.
ray,It was too heavy. We had to unload it.
dealer,She had something in the bag.
ray,What is she saying!?
dealer,She says her baby. Her baby was in the bag.
ray,It didn't feel like there was anything in that bag.
lila,We gotta go back.
ray,I can't believe they put their baby in a duffle bag.
lila,I can't believe you left it out there.
ray,If you'd let me search it I would never have taken it-
lila,We gotta go back.
ray,I know! I know that.
mitch,"That's what you wanted, right?"
mitch,"Thanks Man, Have a Merry One."

lila,It's dead.
ray,Come on!
lila,It's dead.
ray,Tap the bottom of his feet.
lila,Why?
ray,That's what they did to get Ricky breathing when he was born.
lila,I don't want to touch it.
ray,"Well, I can't hold it and drive."
lila,I don't think it matters.
ray,At least put him next to your body. That will warm him up.
lila,But it's too late.
ray,Just do it! We can't give it back to her cold.
ray,Shit!
lila,Calm down.
ray,Oh shit. What do I do?
lila,Calm down. Just pull over.
ray,What if he saw us go by before. To Bob's.
lila,"He's got no reason to stop us, unless you give him one, so keep your mouth shut."
ray,What if he searches the car. What do we say about-
lila,"He won't, just remember you're white."
trooper napoli,License and registration?
ray," I wasn't speeding, was I?"
trooper napoli,Just step out of the car.
ray,Did I do something?
trooper napoli, Ma'am I'm just directing you to step out of the vehicle?
ray,Okay.
trooper napoli,Step around to the back of the vehicle.
trooper napoli,See that.

lila,It's moving.
ray,What? Are you sure?
lila,Hello little baby.
ray,He was just cold.
ray,We found him.
lila,He was dead.
ray,He was just cold.
lila,He was dead.
ray,"Okay, whatever, you brought him back to life."
lila,"That was the Great Spirit, not me."
ray,All I know is Kmart is closed and I got nothing for under the tree.
ray,Here.
lila,Yeah.
ray,What's that?
ray,Where'd you get it?
ray,"Mitch? Is that the friend you called? It's probably stolen, you know."
ray,"Well, I don't want you hanging around him. That kid is bad news."
ray,"Look , Mister, I got more important things to worry about than toys. I'm trying to get our doublewide."
ray,"Hey, you can lose the attitude. Anyway, Kmart was closed by the time I got off work."
ray,"I told you to be careful with the microwave, didn't I?"
lila,Bernie!
ricky,Daddy?
trooper napoli,Is there a Ray Eddy here?
ray,Yes.
trooper napoli,Can I speak to you outside for a minute.
ray,I haven't gotten the light fixed-
trooper napoli,It's not about that. I just have a few questions.
ray,Sure.
trooper napoli,This is about the woman who was with you.
ray,Yes.
trooper napoli,How long have you known her?
ray,Not too long. She looks after my kids.
trooper napoli,She's a smuggler.
ray,Really?
trooper napoli,Yes.
ray,Wow. That's a shock.
trooper napoli,"Yes, well, there is that element on the Reservation I'm sure you know."
ray,"Yeah, I've heard about it but I didn't know she was involved."
trooper napoli,How did you happen to meet her?
ray,"Uh, I think there was a sign for a baby sitter at the Wolf Mart. That's where I get my gas."
trooper napoli,I just thought you should be aware of that. She's known to have smuggled illegal immigrants into the country.
ray,Oh my God.
trooper napoli,If I were you I'd find a new baby sitter. You don't want her around young kids.
ray,Absolutely.
trooper napoli,"Well, you have an enjoyable Holiday."
ray,"Thanks. You, too.  Ray stands and watches the trooper drive away. She feels in the pocket of her bathrobe for her cigarettes and fumbles to light one, sucking on it, unaware of the cold.  When she turns around she looks at the trailer and notices the smoke-stained siding on one end of it."
ricky,Why is the police man here?
ray,No.
ray,Did you have a fire last night?
ray,You fixed um?
ray,Did you happen to use the blow torch?
ray,"No, it was our house."
ray,"Jesus, you could have killed yourself and your brother."
ray,Put it down.
ray,Put it down.
ray,Put that thing down!
ray,That was an accident.
ray,"He spent the food money on scratch cards, T.J."
ray,Gimme that thing.
ray,He was clean for 23 months.
ray,I know.
ticket taker,The game's over. They're verifying the last winner.
ray,That's okay. I still wanna buy a ticket.
ticket taker,I can't sell you one.
ray,I got money.
ticket taker,Sorry.
ray,I just want to buy some scratch cards.
ticket taker,"Go to Wolf Mart, they sell `um there."
lila,I quit smuggling.
ray, T.J. set the trailer on fire.
lila,I got glasses and now I can see up close.
ray,There's a hole in my bedroom floor. We gotta move.
lila,I don't want it.
ray,What is it then?!
lila,I got enough.
ray,"Yeah, but you gotta get him first."
ray,You should see the inside.
lila,How many bedrooms?
ray,Three. And it's got a jacuzzi tub in the master bathroom.
lila,Wall to wall carpet?
ray,Oh yeah. But the best thing is the insulation. The pipes can never freeze.
versailles,...what I think you'll find with the Commodore -- and you'll be the judge -- is that the vinyl wall covering is perfect for small children. There is never a need to repaint or even touch up-
ray,I wanna schedule a delivery.
versailles, Give me just a second.
ray,It's three thousand but I want it delivered tomorrow.
versailles,I told you all or nothing.
ray,Take it as a deposit. All you have to do is show up. If I don't have the rest you keep it.
versailles,"Can't argue with that. You'll have to sign something, though."
lila,Blow the horn.
jimmy,Heat wave!
lila,"You got a run for us, Jimmy?"
jimmy," It's pretty slow after Christmas. Unless you wanna to go off the Rez, there's a guy up in Montreal who's usually got heads."

jimmy,Twenty miles or so. But...you gotta watch out for the Mounties and the Surete. and...this guy deals in ya' know girls.
ray,Have you ever been there?
lila,A few times. Have you?

lila,Up there. That's it.
ray,Can't miss that.
bartender,Oui?
lila,Bruno.
bruno, You looking for a job.
lila,"No, Jimmy called-"
bruno,"Oh yeah, Jimmy. Okay."

lila,"We need to get paid, first."
bruno,"Oh, yes."
lila,You only got six hundred here.
bruno,You get the rest at drop off.
lila,It's six hundred apiece.
bruno,"That's the deal I make with Jimmy, now you want to change?"
lila,It's twelve hundred.
bruno,You want to make a problem?
lila, Let's just go.
ray,Okay. We'll take them.
lila,Let's go.
ray,Just open the trunk.
bruno,You must be the brains of the operation.
ray,Turn around!
bruno, I don't have any more.
ray, Go get it.
bruno, Give it to her.
lila, Let's get out of here. I'll give you the rest of the money.
ray,No. But thanks.
lila,You're gonna get us all killed.
ray,Put it there.
bruno, You aren't so smart as you look.
ray,He shot me.
lila,You should'a just taken the money from me?
ray, I'm tired of people stealing from me.    Is it all there?
lila,"We gotta get outta here, first."
ray,Just COUNT IT and make sure it's all there!
lila,It's all there.
ray,Good.
lila,Slow down a little. We gotta keep it under the speed limit.
ray,I can't.
lila,We gotta get off this road!
ray,How much farther to the reservation?
lila,Just up at the tree line.
ray,What the hell? We're on the reservation.
lila,They can't arrest us but if they catch us they'll take the money.
ray,Shit!
lila,That ice is black out here.
ray,Will it hold us?
lila,I don't know.
dispatcher,"...the Quebec Surete in pursuit of a vehicle with New York State plates, identified as a blue Plymouth Acclaim and the suspects are two women, suspected to be carrying illegals..."
lila,We gotta crawl out the window.
jimmy,Hi Mom.
velma,"Jimmy, I told you not to bring no more half frozen people in here off the river."
jimmy," We just need to borrow your oven, Mom."
velma,I don't see how I can get any baking done. I'm supposed to be baking 200 doughnuts for pee wee Lacrosse and now I have people bleeding and dripping all over my kitchen.  She opens a closet filled with Indian medicine plants and takes out several kinds.  VELMA  Somebody's been beatin' up on you.  Lila and Ray see the girl's black and blue arms. 
three rivers,"-Good, good Mike. What can I do for you? - -You say non-native smugglers? -A white woman? On the Rez? -I'll look into it and give you a call back. Sure thing.  -I'll take your request to the Tribal Council and give you a call back. -No problem, Mike. You bet."
three rivers,"Hi, Rosalie."
rosalie, Billy.
three rivers,We have a situation with a couple smugglers. They got chased by the Quebec police and crossed the river but their car went in and now the troopers know they're on the Rez.
rosalie,Who is it?
three rivers,Lila Littlewolf and some white woman.
rosalie,What do the troopers want?
three rivers,A surrender of the two illegals and the Non-Native smuggler. They need an example here.
rosalie,Do you know where they are?
three rivers,Probably over at Velma's.
rosalie, What do you think?
barbara,Turn them in.
rosalie,What about Lila Littlewolf?
bernie,We got our own court system.
rosalie,We don't charge people with smuggling.
barbara,Maybe we should.
bernie,"If we did, we'd have to arrest half the people on the Rez."
barbara,We can expel her.
bernie,"You can't start throwin' Mohawks off the Rez, Rosalie. There's only, what, six thousand of us as it is."
rosalie,She makes the Mohawk people look bad.
bernie,But she has a Mohawk son.
rosalie,She cost us a Mohawk son.
bernie,Jake was a big boy. He knew what he was doin'
rosalie,She'll never be anything but a smuggler.
bernie,We've had smuggling on the Rez since Al Capone.
rosalie,Then we'll take a vote.
jimmy,"Hi, Billy."
three rivers,"Velma, seen any smugglers tonight?"
jimmy,"Come on, Billy, you never bothered with smugglers before."
three rivers,"Rosalie is worried people are gonna think the Mohawks let in terrorists. Plus, I got the Troopers on my back. They want the illegals and they say there's some white lady with them too. Is that true, Jimmy?"
ray,I gotta go.
bernie,"Hi, Lila."
lila,Hi Bernie.
bernie,You're in a lot of trouble.
lila,Expel me?
bernie,"For five years. You can appeal, but you'll never be able to change Rosalie's mind."
lila,They can't do that.
bernie,They'll make your life miserable if you try to stay.
lila,They've already done that.
bernie,"Believe me, it could get even worse."
ray,I thought this was all legal on the reservation.
bernie,"If she leaves, they'll turn you in Lila. The troopers want somebody."
ray,"But, she's a Mohawk."
bernie,"The Chiefs want her out, so there's nothing standing between her and the troopers."
ray,"Listen, my kids got no one but me."
bernie,If you leave she won't see her son again.
lila,Let her go.
bernie,"Lila, you're giving up on him and he's only one year old."
lila, Just go.
ray,"At least you got family to take care of him, ya' know?"
lila,He might be better off.
bernie,Jake wouldn't agree with that.
lila,"It was all for a new crib. I wanted the baby to have a pretty new crib, not some handmedown. And he wouldn't let me go alone.  I was too fat to get behind the steering wheel."
bernie,He wanted to keep you and little Jake safe.
ray,"It's just a few months, right?"
lila,Okay.
ray,"And don't let him jerk you around. Versailles, I mean.  Go with her. Okay?"
bernie,Sure.
ricky,Can I have more corn?  T.J. dumps his own corn onto Ricky's plate. 
lila," Sorry, Thunder, I got nothing for you."
evelyn,What do you want?
lila,I need his coat.
evelyn,You can't have him.
lila,Say goodbye to your Dudah.
bernie,She's gonna kill me for taking this out of her car.
ray,How long is it for me. You know if I confess?
trooper napoli,As long as they're not on a watch list. Four months.
ray,Will they get sent back?
trooper napoli,Not necessarily. They can apply for asylum.
ray,Can I have a cigarette?
trooper napoli,Is there somebody I can call for you? To take care of your children.
ray,I got somebody.
trooper napoli,A relative.
ray,A friend.
