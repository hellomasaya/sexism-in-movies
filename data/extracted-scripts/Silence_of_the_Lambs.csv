Speaker,Dialogue
clarice,Freeze! FBI!
brigham,Starling's reaction time was excellent. Let's break. Critique in five.
ardelia,"Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?"
clarice, Never cock. Just squeeze.
ardelia, I love it when you talk dirty.
brigham,"What're you laughin' at, Junior G- Man? She got off four rounds to your two."
brigham," One hundred reps, each hand, every day. Now tidy up, the Section Chief wants to see you."
clarice,What'd I do?
ardelia,"Stay cool. Just remember to call him ""God."""
crawford,"Starling, Clarice M., good morning."
clarice,"Good morning, Mr. Crawford."
crawford,Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
clarice,I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
crawford,"A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand. Walk me to my car, Starling."
crawford,"We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?"
clarice,Not yet.
crawford,"You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum."
clarice,Who's the subject?
crawford,The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
clarice,The cannibal...
clarice,"Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?"
crawford,"You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now."
crawford,"I don't expect him to talk to you, but I have to be able to say we tried... Lecter was a brilliant psychiatrist, and he knows all the dodges.  Dossier on him, copy of our questionnaire, special ID for you... If he won't talk, then I want straight reporting. How's he look, how's his cell look, what's he writing? The Director himself will see your report, over your own signature - if I decide it's good enough. I want that by 0800 Wednesday, and keep this to yourself."
crawford,"Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?"
clarice,Yes sir.
crawford,"Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is."
clarice," And what is that, sir?"
chilton,"You know, we get a lot of detectives here, but I must say, I can't ever remember one so attractive..."
chilton,"Will you be in Baltimore overnight...? Because this can be quite a fun town, if you have the right guide."
clarice,"I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon."
chilton," Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy."
chilton,"Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you."
clarice,"How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?"
chilton,"A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his ""taste"" - so to speak."
clarice,"I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school."
chilton,Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
chilton,"Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?"
clarice,I understand.
chilton,"I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... On the afternoon of July 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary. His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an EKG. When the nurse bent over him, he did this to her..."
chilton,"The doctors managed to re-set her jaw, more or less, and save one of her eyes. His pulse never got over eighty-five, even when he ate her tongue.  I keep him in here."
clarice, Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think?
chilton," You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time."
clarice,But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
chilton,"When she's finished, bring her out."
barney,"Hi, I'm Barney. He told you, don't get near the bars?"
clarice," Clarice Starling. Yes, he did."
barney,"Okay. Past the others, it's the last cell. Stay to the middle. I put out a chair for you."
barney,I'm watching. You'll do fine.
dark figure,I c-can sssmell your cunt!
clarice,Dr. Lecter... My name is Clarice Starling. May I talk with you?
clarice,"Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire."
clarice,"I am, yes."
clarice,I'm - still in training at the Academy.
clarice,"We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?"
clarice,"He said - ""I can smell your cunt."""
clarice, Yes.
clarice,Maybe they'll catch up.
clarice," Did you do those drawings, Doctor?"
clarice,"All that detail, just from memory...?"
clarice,"Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -"
clarice,"I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't."
clarice,"No, I came because we need -"
clarice,Five... so far.
clarice,"Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -"
clarice,I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
clarice,It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
clarice,No. You ate yours.
clarice,No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
clarice,"You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to."
clarice,Reasonably so. Yes.
clarice,And the questionnaire...?
miggs,I b-bit my wrist so I c-can diiiieeee! S-ee how it bleeeeeeeeds?
clarice,Then please - do this test for me.
clarice,"What's that, Dr. Lecter?"
ardelia,"Phone call, Clarice. It's God."
clarice,"Thanks, Ardelia."
ardelia,"You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?"
clarice,"Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face."
ardelia,Damn. Wish I had time for a social life.
clarice, Mr. Crawford?
crawford,I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
clarice,"It's all there, sir, practically verbatim."
crawford,"Every word, Starling? Every gesture?"
clarice," Sir, why? Is something wrong?"
crawford,"He mentioned a name, at the very end. ""Mofet..."" Any followup on her?"
clarice,"I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But ""Split City"" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice."
crawford,Well? Why aren't you there right now?
clarice,"Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -"
crawford,"Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?"
clarice,To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
crawford,"Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that."
clarice,"Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me."
crawford, Miggs has been murdered.
clarice, Murdered...? How?
crawford,"The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?"
clarice,"I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it."
crawford,"You don't have to feel any way about it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. Why not, what can they do? Take away his books for awhile, and no jello...  I know it got ugly today. But this is your report, Starling - take it as far as you can. On your own time, outside of class. Now carry on."
clarice,Well God damn it! You old creep. Creepo son of a bitch. Let Miggs squirt you and see how you like it.
crawford,"I'll take over, Patricia. You get some rest."
clarice,So no one's been in here since - 1980?
clarice,"I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it."
clarice,"Would you hold these, please?"
clarice,"Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?"
clarice, Good idea.
clarice,"Okay, Mr. Yow..."
clarice,That wasn't me.
clarice,Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
clarice,Not yet! - just wait for me.  Maybe in about two seconds.
clarice,"Well, Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore."
clarice,"Hester Mofet... ""The rest of me."" Miss The-Rest-of-Me... Meaning, you rented that place."
clarice,"You put those - things in there. Paid for it in advance, ten years ago... Why, Dr. Lecter?"
clarice,Thank you.
clarice,How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
clarice, Why? Do you know something about him?
clarice,"Why don't you tell me about ""Miss Mofet?"" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?"
clarice,"If you didn't kill him, then who did?"
clarice,Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
clarice,"Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated."
clarice,Because you weren't wasting my time.
clarice,I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
clarice,I never thought about it.
clarice,"That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask."
clarice,I don't know. Is it?
clarice,"Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?"
clarice, Who killed your patient?
clarice,"Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible."
catherine,This stuff's givin' me the munchies. Where's that bag of popcorn?
cody,Shit. Left the groceries in the car.
catherine,"'S okay, I'll go."
catherine,Help you with that?
man,Would you? Thanks.
man,Are you about a size 14?
catherine, What?
man,Good.
man,Good.
man,Gooood...
brigham,Clarice Starling! Are you in here?
brigham,"Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford."
clarice,Where?
brigham,"Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?"
clarice," I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries."
brigham,"Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient..."
clarice,Sometimes.
brigham,"He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never."
brigham,"You're goin' in the field, so you gotta have full kit. Take this - it's my own..."
brigham,"Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises."
clarice,I will... I promise.
brigham,"Listen, I hope you never need a thing I've taught you. But you've got something... Jack sees it, I do too. If you ever need to, you can shoot."
brigham,"Bless you, Starling..."
crawford,"Why, we don't yet know... There's no evidence of rape or physical abuse prior to death. All the mutilation you see there is post-mortem.  I'm hot, are you hot? Bobby, it's too damned hot back here..."
crawford,"So. Three days. Then he shoots them, skins them - usually just the torsos - and dumps them. Each body in a different river, in a different state, downstream from an interstate highway. The water leaves us no fingerprints, fibers, DNA fluids - no trace evidence at all. That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one..."
crawford,"Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about"
clarice,There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
crawford,"Good idea, but he thought of it, too. We've run simulations, using different vectors and the best dates we can assign. You put it all in the computer, and smoke comes out. No, this one is different. This one has seen us coming..."
crawford,"Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see."
clarice," He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment."
crawford,Why?
clarice,"What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do."
crawford,Why not?
clarice,He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
crawford, Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
clarice," Like I have a ""knack"" for Dr. Lecter?"
crawford,"Okay, Starling. Let's have it."
clarice,You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
crawford,What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
clarice,You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
crawford, Are you finished?
clarice,"He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford."
crawford,"Number One. Maybe there's a connection, maybe not. Lying and breathing are the same thing to Lecter. Number Two. If I'd sent you in there with something to hide from him, he'd have known it, instantly. He'd never have trusted you."
crawford,"Number Three, I didn't bring you along today just because you can do first-rate forensics. If Lecter is becoming part of this case, you've got the most current read on him. And Number Four - you don't have to like me, or the way I do things. But you do have to keep a cool head. Especially now... Because from here on out, you'll know everything I do. Are we straight on that?"
crawford," You think about him long enough, you get a feel for him... Then, if you're lucky, out of all the stuff you know, one little part of it tugs at you, tries to get your attention... You let me know when that happens, Starling. Live right behind your eyes, today. Don't try to impose any patterns on this guy. Just stay open and let him show you..."
crawford,"School's out, Starling."
crawford,We're around back.
crawford,"Sheriff Perkins? Jack Crawford, FBI... This is Officer Starling. We appreciate your phoning us."
sheriff," I didn't call you. That was somebody from the state attorney's office... 'For you do a thing else, I'm gon' find out if this girl's local. It could just be somethin' that outside elements has dumped on us."
crawford,"Well sir, that's where we can help. If -"
sheriff,"I don't even know you, Mister... Now we'll extend you ever courtesy, just soon as we can, but for right now -"
crawford,"Sheriff, this, ah - this type of sex crime has some aspects I'd rather discuss just between the two of us. Know what I mean?"
sheriff,"Oscar, run fetch Dr. Akin from the chapel. And tell Lamar to come on when he's done playin' that music."
crawford,"I need a six-way linkup! Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, Atlanta, and Dallas... What?... Can you hear me...?"
clarice,"Gentlemen. You officers and gentlemen! Listen here a minute, please. There's things I need to do for her..."
crawford, We're starting. Tell everybody to stand by for fingerprint transmission.
clarice, Bill...
crawford,"What do you see, Starling?"
clarice,"Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me..."
clarice,"Two of the fingernails are broken off, and there's - dirt or grit under the others. She tried to claw her way through something... I'll scrape out samples after I've printed her."
lamar,Them fishhooks are set too close together. No wonder the Franklin boys was scared to say they found her.
clarice,Think they were runnin' a trotline?
clarice, It's a Fish and Game violation. Like poaching. There's a big fine.
lamar,Right... Are you from around here?
clarice,They do it lots of places.
crawford,"Get photos of her teeth. Then we'll fax her fingerprints to Washington, try to trace her through Missing Persons."
clarice,She's got something in her throat.
lamar,"When a body comes out of the water, alots of times there's like, leaves and things in the mouth."
crawford,What is it - some kind of seed pod?
lamar,"Nawsir, that's a bug cocoon. But how come that to get way down in there? 'Less somebody shoved it in..."
crawford,"She'll be easier to print if we turn her over. Lamar, will you give me a hand?"
lamar,"Yessir, I will. Clarice takes a jar from her kit, carefully drops the cocoon inside."
clarice,I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
crawford,They weren't there. Get close-ups.
clarice,"Thanks, I'm not thirsty."
lamar,"No, hold it under your chin, there, and on your temples. Cold'll make you feel better. It does me."
crawford,"When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there."
clarice,"It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters."
crawford, Point taken.
crawford,"When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit."
clarice,"I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?"
crawford," The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -"
clarice,Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
crawford,You seem pretty sure of that.
clarice,"Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum."
crawford,"Before we caught him, Lecter had a big psychiatric practice in Baltimore. But he traveled all over the country - teaching, consulting... Christ, even testifying in murder trials. Who knows how many potential psychos he turned loose, just for the fun of it...?"
catherine,"Mister... my family will pay cash. Whatever ransom you're askin' for, they -"
catherine, Oh God... oh God...
catherine,"Mister, if you let me go, I won't press charges, I promise. You've only had me here a couple days, and -"
catherine,"Is that all...? See - see, my mom is a real important woman... Well, I guess you already know that. She'll pay you, no questions asked. Whatever cause you represent - Iran, Palestine - she'll see that -"
ardelia,You better come see this.
tv anchor,"Memphis Police sources indicate that the missing girl's blouse has been identified, sliced up the back, in what has become a kind of grim calling card. Young Catherine Martin, as we've said, is the only daughter of U.S. Senator Ruth Martin -"
tv anchor,"...to its highest levels, the president himself being said to be, and I quote, ""intensely concerned."" Just moments ago, Senator Martin made this dramatic personal plea..."
clarice," Boy, is that smart..."
ardelia,Why does she keep repeating the name?
clarice,Somebody's coaching her... They're trying to make him see Catherine as a person - not just an object.
ardelia,"I don't know whether to say ""I'm sorry,"" or ""Congratulations."" But girl? - you just went prime time."
crawford,"I don't think he knew that she's a Senator's child. She's a big girl, Starling, like all the rest. We're going on the theory she was randomly targeted by size..."
roden,Tough noogies! It's still my turn.
roden,Of course it counts. How do you play?
pilcher, Officer Starling. Welcome back.
roden,Where the hell did this one come from? It's practically mush.
clarice,You really don't want to know.
pilcher,"Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin."
roden,"I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?"
pilcher,Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.
pilcher," What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?"
clarice,"I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher."
pilcher,Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
clarice, Not lately. But maybe someday.
roden,Positive match!
clarice,You're sure?
roden," West Virginia... Baltimore. Officer Starling, meet Mister Acherontia Styx."
clarice,And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
pilcher," They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs."
clarice, Dr. Lecter...
crawford,"But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to."
clarice,He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
crawford,"He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun."
clarice,But if he knew we have so little time -
crawford,"If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all."
clarice,"I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal."
crawford,What would it take?
clarice,"Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?"
crawford, State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
clarice,You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
crawford, She doesn't know what we're up to. And we can't afford to let her find out.
crawford,"She's the mother, Starling. She can't possibly comprehend what Lecter is. She'd make the mistake of pleading with him. Begging him... He'd feast on her pain till the last second of that girl's life..."
chilton,"What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!"
clarice,"Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case."
chilton,"He's my patient! I have rights!  I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice."
clarice,"I'm acting on instruction, Dr. Chilton.  This is the U.S. Attorney's number. Now please - either discuss this with him, or let me do my job."
clarice,"I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us."
clarice,"By the book, he's a sadist."
clarice,Yes.
clarice,They all were.
clarice,She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
clarice, A moth... How did you predict that?
clarice,"If you help us find Buffalo Bill in time to save Catherine Martin, the Senator promises you a transfer to the V.A. hospital at Oneida Park, New York, with a view of the woods nearby. Maximum security still applies, but you'd have reasonable access to books."
clarice,"Best of all, though - one week a year you'd get to leave the hospital and go here.  Plum Island. Every afternoon of that week you can walk on the beach or swim in the ocean for up to one hour. Under SWAT team surveillance, of course..."
clarice,"Copy of the Buffalo Bill case file, copy of Senator Martin's terms. Her offer is final and non-negotiable. If Catherine dies -  You get nothing."
clarice,That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
clarice,"Go, Doctor."
clarice,The death of my father.
clarice,"He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him."
clarice,"No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old."
clarice,"Quid pro quo, Doctor."
clarice," Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive."
clarice,No. Tell me why.
clarice,I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
clarice,Horses - and sheep...
clarice,Two months.
clarice,I - ran away...
clarice, No.
clarice,"No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor."
clarice,You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
clarice,On what basis would they reject him?
clarice,How would he test?
clarice," Yes, Doctor. Please."
chilton,Perhaps you should have been less specific about what kind.  Stand him by the toilet. Then leave us.
chilton,Such a lot of correspondence! I can hardly wait to analyze it in more detail... But first things first.
chilton,"I thought she might be looking for a civil rights violation in Migg's death, so I bugged you... Not a word to me in all these years, Hannibal. Then Crawford sends his bit of fluff over here, and you just turn to jelly. It's too pathetic."
chilton,"You still think you're going to walk on some beach, and see the birdies? I don't think so, Hannibal... I called Senator Ruth Martin, and she never heard of any deal with you. She never heard of Clarice Starling, either. They scammed you, Hannibal..."
chilton,"When Crawford gets through milking you, he's giving you to Baltimore Homicide for the Raspail murder. And they're preparing some special surprises for you right now, in my electroshock room."
chilton,"The Starling bitch wants you to rot here, in this little box, till your teeth fall out and you're soiling diapers. You've seen the old ones, Hannibal. They weep when their stewed peaches get cold. That'll be you, too. Unless - you trade with me."
chilton,"There never was a deal with Senator Martin - but there is now. I've been on the phone for hours, Hannibal, on your behalf. Here's what you get: if you identify Buffalo Bill, and the girl is found in time, Senator Martin will have you transferred to Brushy Mountain State Prison, in Tennessee..."
chilton,"You'll answer me now, or by God, you'll answer to Baltimore Homicide. Who is Buffalo Bill?"
crawford,"Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away."
crawford,You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
crawford,"Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin."
burroughs,"Phone, Jack. Director Burke."
crawford, In a minute!
crawford,"Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated."
crawford,"Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks."
crawford,"Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind."
crawford, Transferred...?
director burke," Jack - did you make some sort of promise to Lecter, in the Senator's name?"
director burke," We're going to have to talk about this, Jack. The Senator's mad as hell. Paul Krendler's over here from Justice, she's asking him to take charge in Memphis... I know that... But you're still in command of the task force, and Lecter's plane can still be ordered back. It's your call, Jack - but I want it now."
crawford, Let him land.
clarice,"Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone."
crawford,Let's get some coffee and talk.
clarice,"Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?"
crawford,"I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me."
clarice,"If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home."
clarice,"Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before."
crawford,"Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip."
clarice,I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
crawford,"Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio.  Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours."
clarice, Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
crawford, They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
boyle,"Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter. I'm Officer Boyle, this is Officer Pembry. We aim to treat you just as nice as you treat us. Act like a gentlemen, you'll get three hots and a cot."
pembry,"But we ain't pussy-footin' with you, buddy ruff. You get cute, try to bite somebody? - we'll tie your asshole in a knot. You savvy?"
pembry," Shit, he's just an ol' broke-dick. Won't be no trouble as all if he don't flip out."
boyle,Dr. Chilton...?
boyle,"If you'll please sign right here, sir, we'll have us a legal transfer."
boyle,Use mine.
pembry,Here they come.
chilton,"Senator Martin, meet Dr. Hannibal Lecter."
krendler,"We need his address, a physical descr-"
krendler,You son-of-a -
catherine,"Get my legs round your neck, you goddamn creep, I'll send you home to Jesus..."
catherine,"Okay, Precious. Time for a treat..."
catherine," Preeeeecious...! C'mon, boy, nice yummy bone... c'mon, you little shit..."
catherine,"Hang on, boy... hang on..."
catherine,Nooooo...!
clarice,"I'm Clarice Starling, Senator. FBI."
krendler,"You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico."
clarice,"Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -"
krendler,"Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it."
clarice, I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
krendler,"Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes."
clarice,"Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -"
krendler,Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
krendler,"He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer."
clarice,"Sir, doesn't this ""William Rubin"" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?"
krendler,"Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?"
clarice,Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
clarice,I just left him.
murray,Every cop in Tennessee wants a look at this guy. 'Sit true what they're sayin' - he's some kinda vampire?
clarice, I don't have a name for what he is.
pembry,"You know the rules, ma'am?"
clarice,"Yes, Officer Pembry. I've questioned him before."
clarice,I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
clarice,Nobody sent me. I came on my own.
clarice,"Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. You couldn't have talked with this ""William Rubin"", even once, and come out knowing so little about him... You made him up, didn't you?"
clarice,I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
clarice,Then tell me how.
clarice,He kills w-
clarice,"Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-"
clarice,No. We just -
clarice,"All right, then tell me how -"
clarice,"Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -"
clarice,"Later, listen, I'll -"
clarice,And - one morning I just - ran away...
clarice,Early. Still dark.
clarice,Yes...! They were screaming.
clarice,"No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run..."
clarice,"I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could..."
clarice,Yes...
clarice,Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
clarice," Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter."
chilton,Out. Let's go.
pembry,"Sorry, ma'a m - we've got orders to have you put on a place."
clarice, Yes. I'll tell you.
foreman,"Hello, dear! Punctual as always. And what have you brought us today?"
foreman,"Oh, marvelous... You know, I always say you're the Leonardo of leather."
foreman,Pardon...?
foreman,Of course... You'll be wanting your -
foreman, I wish we had a dozen like him...
pembry," Ready when you are, Doc!"
pembry,"Sumbitch demanded lamb chops for dinner, extra rare."
boyle, What you reckon he'll want for breakfast - some fuckin' thing from the zoo?
pembry,"Okay, Doc, grab some floor. Same drill as lunchtime."
jacobs,"Boyle is dead, Sarge. His gun's gone..."
murray,This one's alive!
murray,"What's his name, Sarge?"
murray,"You're just fine, Pembry, lookin' good, buddy, you're gonna make it..."
orderly,Downstairs - let's go!
peterson,I see him... There's a weapon by his hand. He's not moving...
radio voice,Can you get the drop?
peterson,We got the drop.
radio voice,One warning. Then take him out.
peterson,Quinn!! put your hands on your head!!
peterson,Put one in his leg.
peterson,No movement.
radio voice,"Okay, Johnny, hold your fire..."
swat commander," We're coming into the car, we're opening the hatch. Watch his hands. Any fire will come from us. Affirm?"
peterson's voice,Got it.
attendant," He's comatose, but his vital signs are good. Pressure's 130 over 90..."
attendant,"His convulsions have stopped, but he's got so much loose skin on his face, it's hard to tell if -"
ardelia,"In the parking garage at Memphis airport. The crew was dead. He killed a tourist, too. Got his clothes, cash... By now he could be anywhere."
clarice,No. He won't come after me.
ardelia,Why not?
clarice, It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
ardelia,Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
clarice,"The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages..."
ardelia,Lecter said a lot of things.
clarice," He's here, Ardelia."
ardelia," Hey, is this Lecter's handwriting? She holds up the map, with its location markings for the kidnapping and body dump sites. Clarice takes it, looks."
clarice,"""Desperately random."" What does he mean?"
ardelia,"Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?"
clarice,"But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order."
ardelia,"Well, except for the one girl."
clarice, What girl?
ardelia,The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
clarice,"Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?"
ardelia,'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
clarice,But why? He didn't weight the others.
clarice,"The first, what the hell did Lecter say about... ""First principles,"" he said. Simplicity... What does this guy do, he ""covets."" How do we first start to covet? ""We covet what we see -"""
clarice,"""- every day."""
ardelia," Hot damn, Clarice."
clarice,"Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -"
krendler,Starling -
clarice,"But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!"
krendler,"The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -"
crawford,Who the hell's fault is -
krendler,- a U.S. Senator who's half out of her head because her daughter's going to be murdered today! And all because of your mind games with fucking Lecter!
crawford,"If you hadn't interfered, he'd still be in custody in Baltimore!"
burke,Jack -
krendler,"You sent in a green recruit, with a phony goddamn offer -"
crawford,You're just trying to cover your ass for letting him escape!
burke,THAT'S ENOUGH! All of you...
burke," I'm sorry, Jack... Go home. Take care of Bella."
clarice,"All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere."
crawford,You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
clarice,You do until six p.m.
crawford,"Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals."
clarice,But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
crawford,"I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now."
clarice,But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
crawford,With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
clarice,"He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it..."
crawford," There's about $300 here... And a hotline code number. They'll patch you through to me, wherever I am."
clarice,Thank you.
catherine,"Get me a telephone. Lower it down to me. Do it now, mister! I don't want to have to hurt this little dog."
catherine,"You shoot motherfucker you better kill me quick or I'll break her fucking neck, I swear to God!"
catherine,"Back off, you son of a bitch! Back off!"
catherine,"That's better... Now get me a live telephone. Get a long extension and lower is down here... And you better do it fast, too, 'cause I think her leg's broken. She's in pain, mister, she needs a vet."
clarice,Mr. Bimmel...?
clarice,Sewing darts. You bastard.
clarice," He's making himself a ""woman suit,"" Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -"
clarice,"That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -"
clarice, Where?
crawford," Calumet City, edge of Chicago. I'll be on the ground in 45 minutes with the Hostage Rescue Team. I'm back in charge, Starling. He's mine."
clarice," Sir, that's great news. But how -"
crawford,"Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is ""Jamie Gumb,"" AKA ""John Grant."" Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name."
clarice,Sewing...
crawford,"Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was ""John Grant."" Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other."
clarice, Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
crawford,"No, Starling, there isn't time. And you've still got crucial work to do in Ohio. We want him for murder, not kidnapping. I'm counting on you to link him to the Bimmel girl, before he's indicted."
clarice,Yes sir... I'll do my best.
crawford," Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me."
clarice,"Yes sir. Thank you, sir..."
clarice,"Mr. Bimmel... did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb, from Calumet City? Or John Grant?  Did she know any men that sew?"
clarice,"Who was her best friend, Mr. Bimmel? Who'd she hang out with?"
stacy,"They said she was just rags, like somebody -"
clarice,"Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?"
stacy,"No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie."
clarice,Did you ever work with her?
stacy,"Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle."
clarice,Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
stacy,"She died. She went to Florida to retire, like two years ago? She dies own there."
stacy," Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?"
clarice,I think so.
stacy,"You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?"
clarice,Sometimes you do.
stacy,"Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job. This - toaster giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day - she thought this was really hot shit. What did she know, big dummy..."
clarice,Good afternoon... I wonder if you could help me. I'm looking for Mrs. Lippman's family?
clarice,"Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?"
clarice,"I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?"
clarice,"Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?"
clarice,Thanks.
crawford,Clarice.
clarice,"I think we may be, yes."
clarice,"Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?"
clarice,Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?
clarice,"No... no, we don't."
clarice,"Good, thank you. Mr. Gordon, do you have a phone I can use?"
clarice,Freeze!
clarice,"Okay... Okay, Mr. Gumb, you're under arrest. Down on the floor, hands and legs spread, move it."
clarice,Shit!
clarice,"FBI, Catherine, you're safe."
catherine,"Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!"
clarice,You're all right! Where is he?
catherine,Get me out!
clarice,I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
catherine,I don't know! Get me out!!
clarice,"Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -"
catherine,"NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU"
clarice,Shut UP!  The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now!
crawford,Starling... your father sees you.
ardelia,Agent Starling! Telephone!
clarice, Agent Mapp! Thank you!
roden,"Hel-lo, gorgeous! Let's get down."
pilcher,Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.
clarice,Starling.
clarice,"Where are you, Dr. Lecter?"
clarice,Dr. Lecter -
clarice,Dr. Lecter... Dr. Lecter...!
