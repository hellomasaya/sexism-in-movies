Speaker,Dialogue
waiter,She's waiting for someone.
younger waiter,Probably waiting for me.
waiter,The door's waiting for you if you don't get back to work.
messenger,"C'est vous, Mademoiselle?"
cara,Oui.
younger waiter,Mademoiselle!    Je vous en prie--
wife,What are you doing Vincent?   Our train car is over here!
cara,Ow!
frank,Sorry!   Excuse me. Pardone moi.
cara,I think I'm going to need your help.
frank,Hmm?
cara,My zipper...  It's stuck.
frank,I'm afraid of hurting you.
cara,Don't be afraid.
frank,I'm... sorry.
cara,It doesn't matter.
frank,Maybe I should let you do this--
cara,Don't give up so quickly.
frank,My name is Frank.
cara,Cara.
steward," Will you and your wife take dinner here or in the dining car this evening, monsieur?"
frank,"Pardon me?   Oh, no.   We're not actually--"
cara,"The dining car would be lovely, thank you."
cara,Are you ill?
frank,What?   No.
cara, So you decided to take a holiday on the Orient Express?
frank,I'm on my honeymoon.
cara,Your honeymoon?
frank,She's in Pennsylvania.
cara,If you'd like to tell me.
frank,Two weeks ago she left me. For the owner of a pizza parlor.
cara,That's awful.
frank,No travel insurance. No refund on the tickets. So... here I am. On my honeymoon.
cara,"I'm sorry, Frank."
frank,"I really loved that pizza too. ""Bala Pizza"" if you're ever in Rosemont."
cara,I wouldn't touch it.    I'm loyal to you.
waiter,"A Cointreau for Mademoiselle. And for Monsieur... a ""Miller Light."""
frank,Thanks.
cara,You read spy novels. 
frank,Okay... you'd be a diplomatic attach or... let's see... a girl from East Germany whose father's been kidnapped by Soviet agents. They're blackmailing you into stealing... probably a microchip. There's usually a microchip involved.
cara,What awaits me?
frank,"Trouble, certainly."
cara,Danger?
frank,No doubt. You'll probably be shot at in less than two chapters.
cara,Is there a man in my life?
frank,Maybe.
jones,"We're putting a lot resources into this investigation, John. Tell me you're going to get him this time."
ackerman," We're going to get him this time, Ms. Jones."
goyal,She's on the train. They'll be in Venice in the morning.
ackerman,"Our target's name is Alexander Pearce. British citizen, born in London into an ordinary middle class family. The only thing remarkable about his childhood was a preternatural gift for numbers."
jean luc,Your mastermind couldn't pass his exams on his own?
ackerman,He didn't fix his test scores; he fixed the scores for all the girls in the class. It made him very popular.
quinn,"You've assembled quite a task force to catch a common money launderer, Mr. Ackerman."
ackerman,"There is nothing common about Alexander Pearce. Quiet simply, he has turned money laundering into an art form. His greatest innovation: The False Lawsuit."
quinn, The money travels from America to the Cayman Islands...
ackerman,"Yes, but now the money is legal."
jones,Not quite legal. The I.R.S. has been cheated out of the revenue.  We calculate that Mr. Pearce's tax bill currently stands at $743.7 million dollars.
jean luc, That explains what the American harridan is doing here.
jones,"Exactement, monsieur."
ackerman,Mr. Pearce has some other debts as well. Most of you will recognize Ivan Demidov...
jones, The U.S. Government is not participating in an investigation of a member of the Russian parliament; our target is Alexander Pearce.
ackerman,Of course.
german interpol,Has Mr. Pearce ever been in custody?
ackerman,Almost.
ackerman,Finally.     Let's go.
specialist,This is gonna take a few minutes.
cara,I'll be ready in fifteen minutes.
ackerman,Where is he?
ackerman,You have nothing to say?
ackerman,Nobody knows. He disappeared after his escape. He's had extensive plastic surgery to alter his appearance since then. Drug lord Amado Carillo did the same thing in the 90s to successfully elude authorities.
quinn,How do you know about it?
ackerman,"Pearce worked with no more than a few accomplices at one time. He treated them so well that they're virtually all completely loyal. None of them would cooperate. We've questioned the ones we could find, and the only thing we learned is that Pearce apparently arranged it so even his own people have never seen him after the surgery."
jean luc,So nobody knows what he looks like?
ackerman,Correct.
jean luc,"Forgive me for saying so Mr. Ackerman, but he slipped away from you when you knew his whereabouts and his appearance...  What makes you think you can catch him now?"
ackerman,His girlfriend was recently released from custody. He'll come for her. We'll be waiting.
quinn,What makes you so certain?
ackerman,He'll come for her.
frank,I was afraid I'd missed you. I wanted to ask where you're staying in Venice... I'm supposed to catch a shuttle to my hotel but I thought maybe--
cara, I've got a better idea.
cara,You have a booking in the name of Mason.
receptionist,"Si, Signorina."
cara,Signora. That's my husband.
receptionist,"Very good, Senora Mason. Welcome to the Danieli. You are in the Doge's-- our premiere suite.  Is there anything special you require?"
cara,Have a copy of today's Herald Tribune sent up to the room please.
receptionist,"My pleasure, Signora."
porter,"The bedroom is through here. You have two bathrooms, here and here. There is a small kitchen which..."
cara,Yes. Thank you.
porter,Then I will leave you.
cara,You like it?
frank,What's not to like?
cara,I'd have been bored here on my own. There's more than enough room for two.
frank,I can see that.
cara,I didn't ask for an extra bed...
frank,"No, no, no. The sofa's fine. Perfect in fact."
cara,The luggage.
frank,I'll get it.
frank,I've put my things in the other bathroom.
cara,Have you ever been to Venice before?
goyal,She's checked into the Danieli... she's not alone.
ackerman,Good. 
demidov,"Take a seat, Mr. Quinn. Can I offer you a glass of Brunello?"
quinn,"No thank you, Mr. Demidov."
demidov,"You know I'd never admit this at home, but Vodka is for peasants. There's much we could learn from the Italians."
quinn,I don't think so.
demidov, He always had good taste...
quinn,"Mr. Demidov... if I may ask you a question... Why do you care so much about Alexander Pearce? I mean, you've come here yourself... as if it were personal."
demidov,"It may be difficult for you to understand, Mr. Quinn; you Swiss are mercenary by nature. But for some of us, there are things more important than money. I put my trust in Alexander Pearce. He betrayed that trust."
cara,"So... when you're not on a Grand European Tour, what do you do in Rosemont, Pennsylvania?"
frank,I'm a teacher. High school math. And you? What do you do?
cara,"This is what I do, Frank."
frank,You're good at it.
cara,Oh look... a wedding.   How lovely.
frank,I'm not really into weddings at this particular moment in my life...
cara,Oh yes.   I forgot.
cara,Do you think it's really over?
frank,Hmm?
cara,Maybe she'll change her mind. Women do. She might give you a second chance.
frank,I suppose that's a possibility.  That's what I tell my statistics class anyway; life is a game of chance. Endless possibilities and permutations. You just have to calculate the odds.
cara,You haven't answered the question.
frank,"Well...  I'd like to think that love is a question of destiny, not chance..."
cara,For a moment there you just reminded me of somebody.
frank,He doesn't sound like much of a friend.
cara,He wasn't.
frank,So why are you wearing his watch?
cara,"You're smarter than you look, Frank."
frank,"What? No, I can't. This thing must be worth a fortune--"
cara,I insist. You're doing me a favor.  Take it or I'll toss it in the ocean.
frank,I'll wear it until you regain your senses.
cara,It suits you.
frank,I could get used to this.
cara,You should leave Venice tomorrow.  It's a city for lovers Frank; no place to recover from a failed engagement.
frank,What... what did I do?
cara,Nothing.   I'm sorry.
cut back to,REALITY:
waiter,Pardone Signore. Good morning.
frank,When she...?
frank,Goddamn it!   I'm a fucking tourist!
burly welshman,Are ya bloody mad?
frank,Shit...
a gondolier," Run faster, man!"
domenico," You can't let them stay over, man. You start cuddling and then she wants to borrow your car. Stop cuddling, Tomaso!"
frank,Excuse me...
domenico," Hey, what are you doing in here?"
frank,The officers told me to wait here. I've been sitting here for over two hours...
domenico,I think they forgot about you.
frank,Somebody tried to kill me.
domenico,"Mr. Taylor, wow, you had quite a day. Eh? We got chasing, we got shooting."
frank,You think I'm crazy but it's all true.
domenico,"Maybe you crazy AND it's true, my friend."
frank,I have absolutely no idea.
domenico,They followed you from the Danieli?
frank,They came to the room. They pretended to be room service.
domenico,You don't scopata one of their girlfriends or something?
frank,"I didn't ""scopata"" anybody!"
domenico,Who is...
frank," In America the cops catch the crooks, not the victim."
domenico,"Ha ha, we do that sometimes here, too."
frank,No.
domenico,How long you know Cara Mason?
frank,I met her yesterday.
domenico,"And you take her to the Danieli? That must have been good meeting, yes?"
frank,I didn't take her. She took me.
domenico,"You lead an exciting life, Mr. Taylor."
frank,Not usually.
domenico,"Signora Mason was staying with ""her husband"" last night. You marry her, Mr. Taylor?"
frank,No.
domenico,I think maybe Signora Mason might know why these guys behave badly. What do you think?
frank,I think that's possible.
domenico,"You got a phone number, mobile?"
frank,She didn't give me one.
domenico,You need some clothes.     I'll be right back.
frank,Um... thanks.   Where are we going?
domenico,"I'm taking you to the hospital, Mr. Taylor. A doctor should take a look at you."
frank,I'd really rather just go--
domenico,"Don't worry. I put you in Padua, away from Venice. You'll be safe.  Any worry, you call me. I give you my home number."
nurse,Relax signore. We're just going to make sure everything is all right inside your head.
clerk, We'd rather the guests didn't know about the incident.
domenico,Don't worry.   I'll be discreet.
clerk,Grazie.
demidov,Of course.
demidov," What happened, officer?"
domenico,"That's what I'm trying to find out, Signore."
demidov,You are a good detective.
domenico,I do my best.
ackerman,What did we find on the American?
jones,He's a tourist. Member of the teacher's union. Pays his taxes. Has bad luck.
ackerman,Evidently. He had a pair of Russian hit men after him. Are you still going to tell me Demidov is clean?
jones,I never said he is clean.    I just said he isn't our target.
goyal,I'm just wondering how they tracked them down at the hotel...
ackerman, Just so long as they don't beat us to Pearce when the real one arrives.
goyal,The local police picked him up.
ackerman,Then he's safely out of the way.
frank,Hello?
domenico,Well it's official Mr. Taylor. You're not mad.
frank,That's a relief.
domenico,I went to the hotel. Somebody shot at somebody. I found a shell casing. I'll have it analyzed in the morning.
frank,I'd like to be on a flight home tomorrow morning.
domenico,"Relax, you're perfectly safe where you are.  You have any visits from your Signora Mason?"
frank, I wish.
domenico,"Never let them cuddle, Mr. Taylor. One cuddle and it all turns to merda. Good night. If you need anything, you have my number."
frank, Wrong floor.
cara,What are you waiting for?    Get in.
cara,Did you miss me?
frank,A little.
cara, I know.
frank,Do you know why?
cara,It's because I kissed you.
frank, That guy has nothing to do with this.
cara,Neither do you.
frank,There's not enough room!
cara,There's enough room.
frank,We won't make it!
cara,I thought Americans were optimists.
frank,Do I look that much like Alexander Pearce?
cara,How do you know--?
frank,The watch.
cara,I don't know. You're about his size. That's all.
frank, You don't know what your own boyfriend looks like?
cara,Alexander crossed a very dangerous man. He changed his appearance in order to vanish.
frank,Great.
cara,Don't worry. I'm taking you somewhere you'll be safe.
frank,We should go to the police.
cara,Because they did such a good job protecting you before?
cara,Frank... Frank.
frank,And I thought I wouldn't get to do any sight-seeing.
cara,Here we are.
frank,Whoa!
cara,Sorry.
frank,What are you doing?
cara,Making sure no one sabotaged the gas lines.
frank,He goes Barracuda fishing?
cara,He goes Marlin fishing. You catch the Barracudas by accident.
cara,And she left you for a cook?
frank,"With these ingredients, it's not hard."
cara,"I'm glad I decided to come back for you, Frank Taylor."
frank,Can I ask you a question.
cara, I'm not a criminal.
frank,"You carry a gun, you consort with people being chased by killers... I hate to break it to you, but--"
cara,"Okay, I'm a criminal."
frank,For Alexander Pearce?
cara,"He's the most interesting man I've ever known. When I first met him, I wasn't expecting that. He took me by surprise."
frank," I don't regret it, you know."
cara,Regret what?
frank,Kissing you.
cara,What are you doing?
frank,I thought...
cara,You thought what? That I saw you on the train and my heart stopped? That all my life I've been waiting for a math teacher from the Midwest to sweep me off my feet?
the englishman,Have you been reading the newspaper?
cara,Yes... there was nothing there today. Is... is it you? Alexa--
the englishman,No names.    Not on the phone.
ackerman,Place him.   Place him!
cara,"Do we really need another ""recipe?"""
the englishman,I want to make sure our guests are surprised.
the englishman,You're a brave and loyal girl. I'm in awe of you.
ackerman,Go!   Go!   Go!
cara,That's because you leave everything up to me.
the englishman," My only concern is for those who cross you, my love."
the englishman,"You may not believe it, but every step of this miserable game is taken in the hope of earning your trust and ever-lasting regard. I mean that."
cara,You have a talent for saying the right thing.  You always did.
cara,Wait--
goyal,We should check for prints.    Maybe he forgot to wipe it down...
ackerman,I doubt it.
cara,Frank... I have to go.
frank,Resolved?
cara,It will all be over. I'll give you the all clear and you can go back to your life. This will be a great adventure you can look back on.
frank,When will I see you again?
cara,Never.
frank,Is he worth it?
cara,Get back inside.
frank,You're going to risk everything for him. Would he do the same for you?
cara,It doesn't matter. I love him.
frank,He doesn't deserve it.
cara,None of this is your business anymore. Now get back inside Frank!
old man,Signorina.
cara," Mi dispiace, Signor."
ackerman,Why do women find these con men so appealing?
jones,Don't look at me. I married my personal trainer.  She's twenty-six.
ackerman,How did Pearce seduce that beautiful woman? Was it his charm? His looks?
goyal,Looks change.
ackerman,"Maybe it's because if he adores himself and spends every moment gratifying his desires, so then can she."
goyal,She's on the move. Time to go.
ackerman,By all means.    Let's follow the children.
demidov,"When I was a young man, times were very hard. When an opportunity presented itself, you took it."
ackerman, You know what we know.
ackerman, Hold...wait for my signal...
ackerman,What is that fool doing in the middle of my operation?
frank,Time for Alexander and me to meet face to face.
cara," I don't know what you're talking about. Please go, I'd like to have a quiet coffee."
ackerman, Move off. Move off.
frank," Caffe, per favore?"
cara,Cameriere!   No caffe for signor!
frank, With milk!
cara,Do you want to be dead?
frank,"Not particularly, but I'm tired of being afraid. I've been running around like a frightened mouse long enough and I've decided I'm finished."
goyal,He's not going anywhere.
ackerman,Put Lipetti in. Tell him to play it like he's dealing with a rowdy guest-- escort him out.
cara,"Frank, you have no idea what you're sticking your nose into."
frank,"Probably not. But I'm doing it anyway. Alexander Pearce nearly got me killed. It was his idea, right? "
cara,"Wonderful. Another macho idiot.  Conto, per favore!"
frank,"What's the lure, Cara? Obviously not his character. Is it the money? The luxury? What's any of that worth if you're getting shot at and you could go to jail?"
cara,I'm leaving Frank.
frank,"He's smooth, right? He probably has mistresses in every European city, too."
cara,It's really a shame you've scared him off--
frank,What the hell?
cara,Frank!
ackerman,"Abort!   Abort, goddammit!"
frank,"You hide out poolside and send your girlfriend and a total stranger to face the murderers who are after you? Not much of a tough guy, are you?"
ackerman,That goddamn fool.
goyal,What do we do with him?
ackerman,Throw him in the lagoon.
frank,Cara!
agent,Ok Signor... you can come with us now.
ackerman,Please...
frank,It's borrowed.
ackerman,It's a good fit.
frank,Unfortunately.
ackerman,You have a vivid imagination.
frank,I haven't needed it lately.
ackerman,I know that.
frank,Since when?
ackerman,Since the beginning.
frank,How...?
ackerman,Come. I want to show you something Frank.
ackerman, Pull up the CID Academy graduating
frank,You?
ackerman,Take a look at the second row.
frank,Cara...
ackerman,We've been watching you this entire time.
frank, You saw those men try to kill me and you didn't intervene?
ackerman,I'm trying to apprehend a major criminal. I'm not a babysitter.
frank,I want to speak with somebody at the American Embassy. I'm going to tell them that you and your undercover officer knowingly and recklessly endangered the life of an American citizen! Let's see what my government has to say about that!
jones,"We're aware of the situation, Mr. Taylor. But we take a long view of these things... fortunately you are unhurt..."
frank,Then I'll go to the press. I'll tell the entire story to the New York Times.
ackerman, No.   I don't think you'll do that.
frank,Why not?
ackerman,Because I don't think you want to see Cara's entire career destroyed.
ackerman,Women like Cara don't come along very often.
frank,"In my case, they don't come along at all."
ackerman,She's the worst combination: stunning looks and a brilliant mind.
frank,"If she's so smart, how did she get caught up with Pearce?"
ackerman,It started out as a straightforward placement...
ackerman,She was no longer with us.   She was with him.
frank,Then why are you still using her?
ackerman,"She's all I have, Mr. Taylor."
frank,You think she'll turn him in this time?
ackerman,I don't know.
frank,"It's not just me, is it?"
cara,Have you got him?
ackerman,You mean the idiot who ruined our operation?
cara,Have you got him?
ackerman,Yes.
cara,It's your own fault. We never should have endangered a civilian. You should have put an agent into place.
ackerman,There was no time. Besides Pearce is too smart for that; he would have spotted the agent a mile away.
cara,He didn't spot me.
ackerman,Apparently he didn't have to.
cara,What makes you think he didn't?
ackerman,"Okay everybody, listen up."
jones,Pearce's own villa? Why would he risk going back there? He must know we'd be watching.
jean luc,Perhaps he's nostalgic.
ackerman,I doubt that. Maybe there's something of value still there. He left in a hurry after all.
jones,Call in a search team.
ackerman,"We searched the place after the raid last year. If there's anything hidden there, only Pearce knows where it is."
frank,"If you're all around his house, will he show up?"
ackerman,"If I needed your advice Mr. Taylor, I'd ask."
cara,Come in.
frank,I'm sorry.
cara,It's okay.   Come over here.    I need your help.
frank,Ackerman told me everything.
cara,I'm sorry Frank.
frank,There's no apology necessary.
cara, How do I look?
frank,Like the most beautiful woman on earth.
cara,When will you go home?
frank,Ackerman asked me to stay with the surveillance team in case the thugs who came after me at the Danieli show up. I'm the only one who can identify them.
cara, I told him to make sure you were safe until this was over.
frank,You shouldn't worry about me. What about you?
cara,What about me?
frank,What are you going to do?
cara,My job.
frank,You all read the same newspaper.
ackerman,It's a good paper. And sold throughout the world. Makes the classified ads especially useful...
frank,I look forward to meeting him.
ackerman,So do I.
agent," You'll have to turn around, sir. There's been a chemical spill in this area--"
frank, Who's that?
ackerman,What happened? Get it back on line!
jones,Was that Pearce?
goyal,How did he know there would be a camera?
jones,He's taking out the entire surveillance system--
ackerman,Stop him.
technician,I can't! He's cutting the feed at the source.
jean luc,How can one man move through the house that fast?
goyal, What should we do?
ackerman,Shut up!    Everyone.
demidov,"Sorry to disappoint you, my dear."
jones, Who is that?
jean luc,The accent is Russ--
ackerman,Shh!  It's Ivan Demidov.
jones, Not possible.
demidov,"You're waiting for someone, Ms. Mason?"
goyal, What are we going to do?
ackerman,We're going to wait for Alexander Pearce. Just like them.
sniper, She's brought them to the window...
demidov,Not very polite of your boyfriend to keep you waiting.
cara,He loses track of time easily.
demidov,I have a hard time believing that.  Perhaps he's already here somewhere... hiding... even watching us.
goyal,Sir?
ackerman,Demidov's right. He's here somewhere...
jean luc,We have to do something--
ackerman,We have to wait.
jean luc,Yes but--
ackerman, She's my agent. She's my responsibility.
jones,What if he doesn't come?
goyal,Where's Taylor?
demidov, Good news. He loves you.
cara,That's not Alexander Pearce.
demidov,"You know, Mr. Pearce, I thought I was finished with this sort of thing. But in your case, I've been forced to make an exception."
cara,He is NOT Alexander Pearce!
frank,Nothing to be sorry for.
demidov,Good bye Mr. Pearce.
cara,Ackerman!
ackerman,Do it.
frank,Are you all right?
cara,I did well to choose you on the train...
frank,You didn't get to arrest Alexander Pearce...
cara,He never showed up.
frank, You're wrong. I'm here.
cara,Why?
frank,"You said I'd told so many lies, you wouldn't believe me even if I did tell the truth... This was the only way to convince you.  The truth is that I love you. All that matters is that you believe me."
ackerman,Cara... I want the paramedics to make sure you're all right--
cara,No we won't. There's nothing to talk about. I don't work for you anymore.
ackerman,Mr.   Taylor...   you're free to go.
frank," It seems you did, Mr. Ackerman."
goyal,Sir... over here. Take a look at this!
ackerman,He was here.
goyal,Account numbers... access codes... unless I'm mistaken... he left the money behind.
jean luc,A mistake perhaps?
jones,How much is there?
goyal,Looks like 744 million.
jones,That's no mistake...  That's his tax bill.
ackerman,"Oh but I did get my man, Ms. Jones."
jones,There's something I don't understand... how did Pearce manage to get here and open that safe without anybody noticing? And where did he go?
ackerman,Because Pearce was cleverer than all of us.
the englishman,$20 million dollars worth of surgery and that's the face you chose?
frank, It's good to see you too.
cara,You really think they'll just give up?
frank,The Americans have their money.   I left it all for them.
cara,What about Demidov's money?
frank,Well...  You have to save something for your pension.
