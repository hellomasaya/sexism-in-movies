Speaker,Dialogue
catherine,Thanks for the horse.
edward,You liked him?
catherine,He's beautiful...
edward, 's broken.
catherine, Who says?
edward,Mocky-Lock.
catherine,Oh no... No you don't.
edward,"""Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."""
catherine,I bet we can fix it.
miriam,Sing a song of sixpence...
catherine, A pocketful of rye...
catherine,Baked in a pie...
henry,"""Mister E."" is doing fine."
miriam,Did we go sailing?
catherine,Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
miriam,"""Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."""
catherine,Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
henry,Where did that come from again?
catherine,A nursery rhyme.
miriam," Nursery rhymes, fairy tales, the bogeyman... All preparation for the horrors of the real world."
henry,Anybody hungry?  I'm hungry...
cooperman,Edward's parents are here.
ella,He needs a haircut.
catherine,"I'll tell the nurse.  God, he loves when you visit."
ella,My husband wonders if that's true.  He wants to place Edward in a hospital.
henry,"There are other applications for the scanner, Mr. Baines..."
lucien,"I realize that, Henry...  And I know your work, Dr. Kent, is invaluable to this company..."
catherine,"You don't know about me, though, do you?"
lucien,"Catherine, we've waited eighteen months for signs of progress..."
catherine,There's been progress.
lucien,"Yes, but there is no proof the procedure works.  All I have is a belief that your interaction with my son is not a hallucination."
catherine," You picked me, remember?  And I took the job.  Gladly.  This is the next wave and I want to be part of it..."
cooperman,No one is doubting your ability.
catherine,Then what is it?
lucien,"I've invested millions of dollars in this study... And I've convinced others to do the same.  I suppose I should feel responsible to them, but I don't.  I could care less if they see a profit. I'm responsible to my boy, that's all that matters.  You tell me... Am I doing the right thing?"
anne,Thirty.
miriam,You okay?
catherine,He hates me.
miriam,Lucien Baines?
catherine,She thinks I can bring Edward back.
miriam,Someday you can.  We all believe that...
catherine,I want to try it.  Please.
miriam,We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
catherine,Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
miriam,I don't want to find out.
catherine,"Why is it taking so long for us to reach him?  Because we've been reactive, that's why.  And we need to be active."
miriam,Shush.
catherine,"He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play."
miriam,I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
catherine, It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
miriam,"If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world."
catherine,I do it all the time!
miriam,"Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened..."
catherine,I'd be there for him.
miriam,"And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone."
catherine," Okay, okay..."
miriam,"Besides, I don't know what it might do to you.  You're already exhausted.  Have you been sleeping?"
catherine, No.
miriam,"Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television."
catherine,Yes mother.
miriam,"I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here."
catherine,Okay.
miriam,Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
catherine," I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early."
miriam,That's my girl.
catherine,"Pleasant dreams, Mister E."
catherine,Go.  To.  Sleep.
ramsey,Who found her?
cole,Surveyor for the railroad... 'Bout six this morning.
novak,"Thanks for waiting, Teddy."
teddy lee,Bleach.
novak,Anne Marie Vicksey.
cole,She the one from Santa Cruz?
novak,Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
teddy lee,Someone looking after her little girl?
novak,Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
teddy lee,The poor thing.
ramsey,"Well, honey, what's worse?  Doing it yourself or asking your mother for help?  I have no idea, Jeannie."
novak,How is she?
ramsey,Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
novak,Here he is.
ramsey,"Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!"
teddy lee,Hot off the presses.
ramsey, More hair.  I could knit this guy a toupee.
teddy lee, So?
novak,Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
teddy lee,Now?
novak,Now.
teddy lee,Complete absence of melanin.
ramsey,And that means?
novak,The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
teddy lee,"Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed."
julia,Oh no...
julia,God... I didn't see you.
stargher, Good boy.
novak,"Donna Krozin.  Helen Francis, Teresa Manicki..."
ramsey,A purebred German Shepherd.
novak,"Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked."
teddy lee,The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
novak,It's his dog.
ramsey,Registered breeders of German Shepherds.
novak,"Be thorough, but be fast.  This guy's accelerating. He only waited six days this last time. When he started, two months could pass."
distorted voice,Me god feed on pain.
distorted voice,Go sleep Carl.  Me god wake up now.
ramsey,She was still living at home?
john,We were looking at apartments.
ramsey,"John, you came to pick her up when?"
john,Eight o'clock.  We were going out for my birthday.
ramsey,No sir.  I'm sorry.
novak,After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
ramsey,"She remembers because it was her ""dream truck.""  Wanted one just like it."
stockwell,"Ramsey, Novak?"
novak,Where is he?
stockwell,"Edison.  Just east of Loma Park.  SWAT's had the house under surveillance for about twenty minutes.  Suspect is Carl Rudolph Stargher.  No registered weapons, no priors.  Got a license for his dog, though.  Named him Valentine..."
novak,"You're the bad man, aren't you, Carl?"
brock,Glad you could make it.  We lose the sun in half an hour.
novak,Have they seen him?
brock,No.  There's been movement in the kitchen.  But it could be the dog.  You think she's in there?
novak,We proceed assuming she is.
ramsey,Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
novak,No.  Can you get a man close?
ericson,I'm at the back door.
ericson,"I have a man down.  Repeat, man down."
ericson,Can't see his face.
novak,Go.
ericson,FBI!
ericson, I've got the dog!
novak,Paramedics.  NOW.
stockwell,They'll take him to County General. Reid's already there.
novak,Make sure he stays cuffed.  Two men on him at all times.  I don't want anyone treating him but Reid.  Not so much as a thermometer up his ass.  Understand?
ramsey,She's not here.
julia,Hey!
reid,"Minimal activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.  And here, the anterior cingulate cortex.  It's what helps distinguish between external and internal stimuli."
ramsey,What the hell does that mean?
teddy lee, He's schizophrenic.
ramsey,"What're you doing here, Reid?  Paving the way for his insanity defense?"
reid,No need.  There won't be a trial.  This is no act.  The coma is real.
ramsey,Whoa.  Wait a minute.
reid,You ever hear of Whalen's Infraction?
teddy lee,What about Thorazine? Or... Desoxyn?
reid,"The normal psychotropics don't work. He's not just catatonic, he's... disappeared.  Like having a dream and never waking up."
novak,This girl.  Julia Hickson.  Only he knows where she is.
reid,Then I'm sorry.  For her and for you.
ramsey,"We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere."
novak,"They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!"
reid,Peter?  This is a longshot.  I mean a real long shot.  You're gonna think I'm crazy...
catherine, I'm not signalling!
miriam, Sing a song of sixpence.
catherine, What's wrong?
miriam, Nothing.
catherine, Why did we stop?
cooperman, We have a situation.
miriam,When did he lapse into the coma?
novak,Sometime yesterday morning.
cooperman," John and Ella Baines - as well as the Sunerset Board of Directors - have given their approval, but the decision is yours."
miriam,What about the legalities of this...?
novak,"Stargher is in custody.  The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights."
henry,So what you're asking us to do is illegal?
novak,"No, not at all.  We're dealing with exigent circumstances.  Somewhere there's a kidnapped woman still alive.  If we weigh the suspect's Constitutional Rights against the public safety. The Law favors the victim and gives us a lot of leeway.  It's called the Public Safety Exception."
cooperman,So what can you do?
novak,"Pretty much anything we want.  There's a chance to save a human life.  Because of that, Stargher has no reasonable expectation of privacy."
catherine,What if...?
novak,As far as I needed.
catherine,Do you think he'd tell you what you need to know?
novak,There's always a chance they'll confess.
catherine,"Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?"
novak,"Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that..."
catherine,"Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am."
ramsey,Is it possible?
catherine,"If he came to trust me, yes, but it takes months to build that kind of trust.  Someone like Stargher can't distinguish between fantasy and reality. It's all the same.  He might tell me she's in Timbuktu and absolutely, one hundred percent believe it to be true, but she's..."
fbi tech, That gets you into the Bureau Database.
novak,Thanks.
ramsey,You sure you want to go through with this?
novak,What else do we do?!
ramsey,"I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?"
novak,I don't have to.
ramsey,"Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it."
novak,"Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say ""It was all his idea."""
ramsey," That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die."
novak,That won't happen.
cooperman,They're ready.
henry,Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
miriam,"They took care of that, thank you, Henry. "
henry,"Gentlemen, you stand before the one and only Neurological Cartography and Synaptic Transfer System."
novak,"I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some ""troubled kid"" you're dealing with."
catherine,I realize that...
novak,How hard could it be...?
catherine,The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
miriam,"Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia."
catherine,Like a New Year's Day hangover.
miriam,He needs to be turned over.
novak,"This man is deeply disturbed, he..."
catherine,You don't know the procedure.
novak,I know him.
miriam,"That may be true, but you don't have Catherine's gift.  She...  What happened here?"
ramsey,We removed eight metal rings.
catherine,Then he should like this.
henry,"Don't touch that, please."
ramsey,Sorry.
miriam," This isn't your responsibility. Remember that.  Don't let them use guilt as a tool.  If you want to stop, say so."
catherine,I'll be fine.
miriam,She said convincingly.
novak, That's the stuff?
henry,"About twelve years of research, right Miriam?"
miriam,Don't remind me.
ramsey,What is it - are they - exactly?
miriam,"Psychostimulants, serotonin, stabilizers, meprobamate, Neurontin, lithium carbonate.  And my baby.  It duplicates and expands upon the effects of a chemical called oxytocin, forcing a break in the neuron connections that hold experience.  So new experience can form."
henry,"There's a touch-sensitive microchip implanted in her hand.  If she becomes frightened, disoriented, or simply wants to end the session, she signals us to abort."
miriam,"Although none of what she experiences is real, she can be tricked into thinking it is.  The mind is awfully gullible, so she needs to monitor herself."
catherine,No.  No.
novak,"You said she has a ""gift."""
henry,"Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke."
miriam,"Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as ""receivers.""  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared."
catherine,Hello?
stargher king, Where you come from priddy thing?
novak,What happened?
henry,Must've been rather unusual.
ramsey,What happens here?
henry,We don't talk about that.
novak,What happens?
henry,"Well, Theoretically, while she's inside. If she came to believe that Stargher's world is her world, her mind has the power to convince the body that anything done to it is, um, actually done."
miriam,"Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry."
novak,Dr. Kent?
miriam,Deep breaths.
catherine,Is it cold in here?
miriam,What happened?
novak,I'll get her...
novak,"Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete."
catherine,Do you think that's funny?
novak,"No.  Not at all.  From what I understand, he knows I""m here, isn't that right?"
catherine,It doesn't have much to do with science.
novak,What then?
catherine,The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
novak,"Ah, the part of us that can't be explained."
catherine,Agent Novak?
novak,"Peter, okay?"
catherine,Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
novak,Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
catherine,"Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share."
novak,"That's what therapists are for, right?"
catherine,"During the sessions.  When I'm inside. I see those things.  What a person hides, what they despite, what they want to control.  With Stargher..."
novak,What did you see?
catherine, I don't want to talk in here.
catherine,Why'd you bring him here?
novak,"You're the shrink, you tell me."
catherine," As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes.  He makes Julia real for me."
novak,"It's an old lawyer trick.  Target the emotions.  Do it right, you get a reluctant witness to testify, a scared kid to confess."
catherine,You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
novak,"I did, yeah."
catherine,"You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself."
novak,What about Julia?
catherine,"This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his."
novak,"You think you can do this, don't you?"
catherine,"He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed."
novak, This is Stargher we're talking about?
catherine,"Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy."
novak,Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
catherine,Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
novak,"It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like ""remorse."""
catherine,Then what is he?
novak,Evil.
catherine,If you believe that.
novak,Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
catherine, What happened to Charles Gish?
novak,What difference does it make...?
catherine,Tell me.
novak,"Right after the trial, the night after he was released.  Mr. and Mrs. Frank Simmons found Charlie sitting in their living room watching TV with their twelve-year old daughter Margaret.  He'd cut her right down the middle with a carving knife."
catherine,You're sure of that?
novak,Yes.  I am.
novak,Right here.
ramsey,"Next time, tell me, okay?"
novak,But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...
ramsey,Your colleagues want to know what to do with Stargher.
catherine,Tell them to prep him.  And that I'll be right there.
novak,Thank you.
catherine,I need something.
catherine,"You're a good boy, aren't you, Valentine?"
miriam,"I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this."
henry,I think that's the whole point.
novak," Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is."
catherine,"Okay, okay..."
catherine,"Don't kid around, Henry..."
catherine,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm not sleepy."
catherine,Valentine?
catherine,Need some help?
martin,What did you do know?  You make a mess? I hate a mess.
woman,"I got you a present, cutie-pie."
martin,"Go back to bed, worm."
woman,"It's okay, we was just."
martin,"Shut up, cunt."
martin,Only girls play with dolls...
catherine,"I want to help you, Carl."
stargher,Help me?  That's good.  That's a good one.  Liar.  Whore.  Cunt.
catherine,You sound like your father.
stargher,I am not like him.
catherine,Then help me.  Where is Julia Hickson?
stargher,Why?
catherine,"Maybe, because you want to."
stargher,Is that right?  You think you know me?
henry,Miriam...
stargher king,"Now shud you mouth, priddy thing, or me god slice you from the kunt to the tits."
miriam,Son of a bitch!
novak,"When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out."
miriam,"That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's ""lost.""  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy."
novak,Into Stargher.  Inside...
miriam,Yes.
julia," Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done."
miriam,"I have done this, you know.  Been inside."
novak,No.
miriam, Deep breaths.
henry,"Pulse is rapid, pressure's a little high..."
miriam,Nervous?
novak,Absolutely.
miriam,I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
novak,Prevacid.  For my stomach.
miriam,Any psychiatric medication?
novak,No.
miriam,What about narcotics?
novak,No.
miriam,"I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest."
novak,I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
miriam,I doubt that.
henry,We should hurry.
miriam,"The first five minutes will be disorienting.  Give yourself time.  Let the drugs do the work.  If you can see, smell, feel, hear, taste things - you're on the right track.  Once you've acclimated, try to get a feeling for Catherine.  Instinct plays a huge role in this.  Trust it."
mother two, My child is an abomination.  He is damned.  He has no soul.
mother three,Me god me boy.  Me god good son.
novak,Not real...
novak,You're Catherine Young.  You majored in Psych at UC San Diego.  You work for Sunerset Industries.
stargher king, Me god gut you like a dear.
novak,Not real.  Not real.  Not real.
stargher king," Nod reel, nod reel, nod reel..."
catherine,Wait...
novak,"Like hell ""wait."""
catherine,He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
novak,Little boy?!  That's him!
catherine,"He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him."
catherine,Carl...
novak,Where the hell are we?
catherine,"Carl, do you know?  Like on a map..."
novak,Let's go.
catherine,CARL!
novak,COME ON!
catherine,I can't leave him!
henry,They're back.
novak,Get me out!
miriam,Don't move!
novak,Is she alright?
miriam,Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
novak,"This is Novak, who've I got?"
cole,Agent Cole.
novak,I need you to find something in the basement...
cole,Already there.
novak,"That hoist, with the winch..."
cole, Carver Industrial Equipment.
novak,"Find out the history of that machine. Who bought it, used it, sold it.  And check Stargher's pay stubs.  I want to know every contractor he worked for. I'm calling you from the chopper in ten minutes."
ramsey,"Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell."
novak,Considering where I've been...
ramsey,Whoa-whoa-whoa.  Mind telling me what the fuck is happening?
novak,I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
ramsey,You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary.  I don't care.
catherine,...a pocketful of rye.
miriam,Four and twenty blackbirds...
catherine,Baked in a pie.
henry,The FBI has left the building.
miriam,Damn him.
catherine,What's wrong?
miriam,Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.
catherine,Go.  I'm fine.  Go.
miriam,Keep an eye on her.
julia,"Do something, Julia."
ramsey,"Pete, listen to me.  What did you really learn in there?  Anything new?  You really think Stargher gave you a save the-day clue?  What if this is all some kind of trick your head is playing on you?"
henry,...there was a moment when we thought we'd lost Agent Novak as well.
henry, She changed the codes.
miriam,What's wrong?
henry,"It would take hours to re-route the system, and even if I did, I shouldn't."
ramsey,What are you talking about?
miriam,"She's done it.  Stupid, stupid girl..."
ramsey,Done what?
henry,Instead of going into his mind...
miriam,She's bringing Stargher into hers.
young stargher,Can...
catherine," Oh...no, honey, I'm sorry.  It's doesn't work that way."
young stargher,He found me...
stargher king,Where thiisss att?!?!  Me god no like id here...
catherine,No.!
stargher king,No?!??!?!?!?
catherine,I said no.
stargher king,You funny.  You thing you stop me god?
catherine,My world...
catherine,"No one deserves it, Carl.  No one."
stargher king,Yer world.  My knife.
stargher,Enough.
stargher king,Enuff?!?!
stargher,I'll tell you what's enough...
catherine,Carl!
stargher king," Give it here, worm..."
stargher,Enough.
martin, Why?  What'd I do?...
young stargher,Time to go 'way.
catherine,Carl...?
young stargher,Bye.
stargher king,"Thank you, Catherine.  You did help me. More than you'll ever know."
catherine,Goodbye Carl.
miriam,He's in full arrest.
pilot,Agent Novak?  Go ahead.
novak,Cole?
cole,"The hoist was manufactured by Carver Industrial Equipment in 1982.  Serial number 117-337J.  Purchased by a boat shop in Lake Havasu, but sold to"
catherine,"Everything's alright now, Valentine.  I promise."
cole,Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
novak,Delano?
cole,Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
novak,You're kidding me.
cole,I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
novak,"The exact location, Cole.  Give it to me."
novak,TAKE IT DOWN!
novak,Cut the engine!
novak,JULIA!
miriam,I left the nutritional information on the fridge door.  Read it.
catherine,I don't need them anymore...
miriam,I know.
catherine,Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
miriam,...give a kiss to Edward.
catherine, Give a kiss to Edward.
miriam,Agent Novak.
novak,Dr. Kent.
miriam,You're looking well.
novak,Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
miriam,That's a secret.
novak,"Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all..."
miriam,Awaiting his arrival.
novak,What about the cat?
miriam,Completely unaware.
novak,Ready?
catherine,Ready.
novak,That went well.
catherine,"Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine."
novak,You sure about this?
catherine,Absolutely.  Abigail...
novak,Yep.  Eloped.
catherine,Good for them.
novak,Well look at that.
catherine,I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
novak,So you say.
catherine,He's mine?
novak,All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
catherine,It doesn't matter...
novak,"I don't know.  I think it does.  You know, Catherine... If you ever want to talk about it.  What happened to Stargher.  That last time."
catherine,Not just yet.  Okay?
novak,I got it.
catherine,Thank you.
novak,No problem.
catherine,No.  Thank you.
