Speaker,Dialogue
a screen play,by Andrew M. Niccol
fade in," A white title appears on a black screen.  ""As night-fall does not come at once, neither does oppression...It is in such twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air - however slight - lest we become victims of the darkness."" Justice William O. Douglas"
director josef,"You keep your work station so clean, Jerome."
jerome,"--Next to Godliness, isn't that what they say?"
director josef,I reviewed your flight plan.  Not one error in a hundred thousand keystrokes.  Phenomenal.  You have a substance test.
lamar," Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?"
jerome, Only every time I'm in here.
lamar,I see a lot of cocks.  I speak from experience. Yours is a beautiful example.  Why didn't my folks order a cock like that for me?
lamar," If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited."
jerome,I'll tell you at the end of the week.
nurse,What are you doing?
maria, I can't do this.
nurse," I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of."
maria,"No, you don't understand.  I can't."
nurse, The doctor will give you something.
maria, I'm not doing it.
nurse," Honey, you've made one mistake--"
nurse, You can have other children.
maria, Not like this one.
nurse," Honey, look around you.  The world doesn't want one like that one."
maria, You don't know what it will be!
nurse, The child won't thank you!
antonio,What's wrong?
nurse,The name?  For the certificate.
maria,Antonio--
antonio," --No, Vincent Antonio."
maria," Oh, Vincent, Vincent, Vincent...I can't let you out of my sight."
geneticist, Put up the dish.
geneticist,"Your extracted eggs...  ...Maria, have been fertilized with... Antonio's sperm and we have performed an analysis of the resulting pre-embryos. After screening we're left with two healthy boys and two healthy girls.  Naturally, no critical pre-dispositions to any of the major inheritable diseases.  All that remains is to select the most compatible candidate."
geneticist,"First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?"
maria," We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with."
geneticist,"You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--"
maria," --We didn't want--diseases, yes."
antonio, We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
geneticist," You want to give your child the best possible start.  Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  Your child doesn't need any additional burdens.  And keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the best of you. You could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result."
antonio," He's right, Maria.  That's right."
geneticist,Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
antonio," Er, no..."
geneticist," Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage."
antonio, I like football.
geneticist," I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he's going to be at least a head taller than you. Prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time."
geneticist, Anything I've forgotten?
maria, We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
geneticist, Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
maria," Antonio, the choir..."
geneticist, I have to caution you it's not fool-proof. With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.
antonio,How much extra?
geneticist,It would be five thousand more.
antonio,"I'm sorry, there's no way we can."
geneticist,Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
maria,What will happen to the others?
geneticist," They are not babies, Maria, merely ""human possibilities""."
geneticist,Smaller than a grain of sand.
anton,"How many astronauts are there, anyway?"
anton,I bet I could be one.
vincent,You're standing on Venus.
mother," Vincent, you have to be realistic.  A heart condition like yours--"
vincent,--I don't care.  I'll take the risk.
mother,It's not just you they have to be concerned about.  Perhaps we could get you one of those new pacemakers.  They're not perfect but--
father," For God's sake, Vincent, don't you understand. The only way you'll see the inside of a space ship is if you're cleaning it!"
anton, You sure you want to do this?
antonio,"Vincent, you damn fool!  You could have killed Anton with your ridiculous contest!  Why should he risk his life to save yours?!  When are you going to get it through your thick head--you can't compete with your brother!  Why try?!"
anton,Why didn't you say anything?
vincent,Why didn't you?  It's okay.  It's the way they want it.
caesar,"When you clean the glass, Vincent, don't clean it too well."
vincent, What do you mean?
caesar, You might get ideas.
vincent,"But if the glass is clean, it'll be easier for you to see me when I'm on the other side of it."
owner,Where's Earl?
jerome,He fell.  Lucky it was only the second floor.
german, That's my name.
vincent,What do you think?
german, provided you know what you're doing and you can meet the terms.
german,You got a photo of yourself?
caesar, I thought I told you not to get any ideas.
german,Vincent...Vincent...
vincent," German, is that you?"
german,"Vincent, come down.  I've found him."
german," He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star."
vincent,I hope he's not just a body.
german,"No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--"
vincent,How do I square the accident?
german," Excuse me, your life."
vincent, Where is he?
german,(smiling confidently What did I tell you?  Which one's the mirror?
vincent, That's the hair color in his profile?
german,Yeah.
vincent, I'd have to bleach my hair.
german," Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee."
vincent, How tall are you?
eugene, Four foot six.
vincent,"Okay, how tall did you used to be?"
eugene, Six one.
vincent, He's too tall.
german, You can wear lifts.
vincent,Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
german,There's a way.
vincent,"You okay, Jerome?"
eugene, Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
vincent,What's wrong with it?
eugene,"I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be you."
vincent, Suit yourself.
eugene," Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?"
vincent,German.
eugene,You're both going to a lot of trouble--  ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself.  Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it.  My point is--how the hell do you expect to pull this off?
vincent," I don't know exactly, Jerome."
eugene," Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it."
jerome, I have to know where you come from.
eugene,"If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome."
jerome, What about this?
eugene,Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
eugene, It needs work.
jerome, You had to be a right-hander.
eugene,Noone orders southpaws anymore.
german, It's no good.  I can see an edge.  He may as well walk in there with a cane.
eugene, You really need that much?
jerome,More than that.  You'll get used to it.
eugene," God, what wouldn't you do to leave the planet?"
jerome, Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
eugene," God, you're serious, aren't you?"
jerome,It's not too late to back out.
eugene,You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure you want the job?
jerome,"What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?"
eugene," Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent."
technician, Congratulations.
jerome, What about the interview?
technician, That was it.
employee 1, Awful.
employee 2,"Yeah, awful it didn't happen sooner."
director josef,You're lucky to be getting out of this.
jerome,We're still going ahead as planned?
director josef,"The launch window is only open until week's end.  Tragic though this event may be, it hasn't stopped the planets turning."
director josef,"You'll have to excuse me, Jerome.  I have to meet with the authorities--naturally, we're co-operating in any way, although I won't tolerate a major disruption.  I wish I was going with you, Jerome."
employee 3," What, no counselling?"
irene,"Excuse me, Jerome.  I'm sorry to bother you."
jerome,No bother.
irene, I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
jerome,Last night?  I was at home.
irene,"Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?"
jerome,No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
jerome," Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about you?  Where were you last night?"
irene,I was at home.
jerome,Were you alone?
irene, Yes.
jerome," So we don't know for sure about you, either."
irene, No.
jerome,Why don't we say we were together?
irene, Why would we do that?
jerome,I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
jerome," Well, shall we say we spent the evening together?"
irene,"To be convincing, Jerome, I would have to know what that was like."
eugene,You didn't forget the truffles?
eugene, Who died?
jerome,The Mission Director.
eugene, You wish.
jerome,They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
eugene,What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
jerome,He was still warm when they confirmed.
eugene, This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
jerome,The place is crawling with Hoovers.
eugene,"So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?"
jerome,That's not the point.
eugene," Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately."
jerome, You're going to have to earn your supper.  I've got my final physical tomorrow.
technician,How old?
young woman, Me?
technician, The specimen.
youung woman, I kissed him five minutes ago.  A real good one.
technician, I'll see what I can do.
michael,"Good evening, gentlemen.  Your table is ready.  Not long now, sir.  You'll be upstairs before you know it.  We're going to miss you."
jerome,Not as much as I'll miss your Stroganoff. I'd like to take one of your chefs with me.
waitress, I'm so sorry.  Did I hurt you?
eugene," Honey, if you'd hurt me, I'd be cured."
eugene,You want to meet a real-life spaceman?
jerome,Let's get out of here.
eugene," You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going."
jerome,You drive.
eugene, I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
jerome,Keep going!!  Keep going!!
eugene, You idiot.  You could ruin everything with a stunt like that.
eugene," You'll all be showering in it, right?"
jerome, And drinking it.  It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
eugene, What is that one?
eugene,How long do you stay up there before you go?
jerome,A day or so.
eugene," I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life."
jerome,You should be going instead of me.
jerome,Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
eugene, You know I'm scared of heights.
investigator, Let's see what you've got to say for yourself.
assistant,The tongue is male.  Mature.  Blonse hair. Brown eyes.  Light complexion.  Between 5'11 and 6'1.  Pronounced Caucasian nose. Thin lips.  Weak chin.  Lobeless ears. Prematurely balding.  Slightly bow-legged. Broad shoulders.  Barrel chest...  Blind.
investigator, The tongue is blind?
assistant, Who cuts out the tongue of a blind man?
investigator, Someone who is mindful that the blind still speak.
eugene, I'm sorry.  Did you want it?
eugene,Let me get it for you.
eugene, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
jerome," It's okay, Eugene."
eugene,You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
jerome,--What car?--Go to sleep.
eugene,--I walked right in front of it.  I was never more sober in my life.
jerome,It's all right.
eugene," I'm proud of you, Vincent."
jerome, You must be drunk to call me Vincent.
detective hugo,"I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir.  It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this."
investigator," A man's dead, Detective."
detective hugo,"Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges..."
investigator,Grudges?
detective hugo, ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
investigator," No, this is your man."
detective hugo," With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--"
investigator,--What about his profile?
detective hugo,"According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes."
investigator, So there's a 20 percent chance he's not dead.
detective hugo,"Even if this Vincent Luca is alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?"
investigator,No.  Not likely.
detective hugo,I take it you're thinking along the lines of a robbery gone sour--a thief disturbed in the act?
detective hugo, Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
investigator," Who knows with these ""deficients""?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence."
detective hugo, I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
investigator,--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
detective hugo,What a pity.
investigator," Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself."
medical director,"Napoleon, you're late for your substance test."
jerome,"Director, Napoleon's helping me today."
medical director,"Well, you take it for him, Jerome."
napoleon,Why did you do that?
jerome, Don't worry about it.
trainer,"You're excused, Irene.  You may resume your duties."
lamar, Six miles later it's still beating like a Goddamn metronome.  I could play piano by that heartbeat of his.
detective hugo,"Director Josef, this is our lead Investigator."
investigator,"How often do you test, Director?"
director josef,Often.
investigator, Surely you know what you have.
director josef,"We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around."
lamar," I swear if I went to lunch and came back, he'd still be there."
investigator,We believe we have a suspect.
director josef,What a relief.
investigator, This unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor.
detective hugo,An age enhancement is being prepared as we speak.
director josef, Irene will make it available to security.
caesar,"I'll take care of that for you, Mr Morrow."
jerome, We were looking at each other.  You stopped.
irene,I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
jerome, We were just looking.
irene,I know about you.
irene," Here, take it."
irene," If you're still interested, let me know."
jerome," Sorry, the wind caught it."
jerome, Have they found our friend?
irene,Friend?
jerome, It was a mercy-killing after all.
irene,They found an eyelash.
jerome,Where?
irene,In the South Wing.
jerome,Does it have a name?
irene,Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
jerome,"Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene."
irene," You celebrate, Jerome?"
eugene," --I know what I ordered.  I ordered ""Honey Dawn"" and you sent me ""Summer Wheat""."
eugene,Any particular reason?
jerome, We can't stay here.
eugene,What are you talking about?
jerome,They think I offed the Director.
eugene,What makes them think that?
jerome,They found my eyelash.
eugene, Where?
jerome,In a corridor.
eugene, Could be worse.  They could have found it in your eye.
jerome, Come on--we're taking off.
eugene,I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
jerome,"--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses."
eugene," Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years."
jerome,They'll recognize me.
eugene," We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned."
eugene,And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
jerome,I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
eugene,Well save those tears.
jerome,You really had other offers?
eugene, I'm sure I could have.
jerome,Mind if I borrow a tie?
eugene,So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
jerome,You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
eugene, Is that all?
jerome,I've got enough on my mind without that.
eugene,If you say so.  The stripe.
jerome, Good choice.
jerome,Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
eugene,I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
jerome,Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
eugene,If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
german,"We still need to overhaul the back-up generator.  What's going on, Eugene, I thought he was going away, not you--you going on vacation?"
eugene," You got it, German."
german, You deserve it.
detective hugo," Not our fish, but sometihng stuck in the net."
detective hugo,This is the age enhancement we're working with.
detective hugo," As you requested, we've kept the parameters wider than usual."
investigator,We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
detective hugo,This is the most likely location--
investigator,"--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it ""likely"" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?"
detective hugo," Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet."
investigator,"Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?"
detective hugo,"With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky."
investigator,I don't like anybody this unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
detective hugo,We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
investigator,"This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets."
irene, You didn't know?
jerome, Yes...yes...
irene, You're angry--
jerome,Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.
john,Shit!  One of those Hoovers is back.
valerie,It's alright.  He's here to see me.
valerie," Sonja, I can't see anyone else tonight."
valerie,"I don't understand you, Investigator."
valerie, You hunt us by day and fuck us by night.  Do you only get it up for In-valids?
valerie,Wouldn't you be happier with one of your made-to-order whores?
investigator," You are so beautiful, are you sure you weren't altered?  This is not the face, the body, of a Godchild.  How could something so lovely be a product of chance?"
valerie,"Is that what keeps you coming back?  Look at you.  Such angry, beautiful, perfect eyes. Do you ever wonder what they would see if they weren't quite so perfect?  They will never see what I see."
investigator," You have so much wrong with you, you'll be lucky to see next year."
valerie,"Are you so much more alive, Investigator?"
investigator, I'm not paying you to talk.
jerome, Don't want to give you a contaminated specimen...if you get my meaning.
jerome,Thanks.  You never know where those swabs have been.
irene,I want to show you something.
irene, Come on!  We'll miss it!
jerome,Come on.  We'll miss it.
irene,What did I tell you?
irene,"I envy you, Jerome."
jerome,You'll be next.
irene,I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun--  --on this satellite right here.
irene," --Listen, I don't want to waste your time and I really don't want you to waste mine. I don't know what you're after but I have a feeling I'm not it."
irene, I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
jerome,What exactly is wrong?
irene,Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.  But unless they come up with something between
irene,Of course I think about it every day.
jerome, Of course.
eugene,How was your evening?
jerome,Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
eugene, What's wrong with her?
jerome, You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
eugene,"You're not thinking of telling her, are you?"
jerome,Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
eugene, She doesn't have to know.  She doesn't want to know.
detective hugo, The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
investigator,A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
detective hugo," No.  But one or two ""borrowed ladders"" have shown up there in the past."
detective hugo,We have to consider the possibility that he's playing somebody else's hand.
investigator, He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
detective hugo," It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window."
investigator, He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
detective hugo," Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals."
investigator,Don't underestimate these imposters.
detective hugo, None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
investigator, Intravenous.
detective hugo, At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
investigator, Blood.  From the vein.
caesar,Look like anybody to you?
younger janitor,Not to me.
caesar,"Ugly sonofabitch though, isn't he?"
director josef,"--Somewhere in the dust of Gaspra is the key.  Back to the beginning of the book--the life we became.  With the original building blocks who knows how far we can take ""the godding""."
mission commander, Even someone as advanced as Jerome will be last year's model by the time we're done.
jerome," I wouldn't get your hopes up, Commander."
irene,"Excuse me, Mr Morrow.  The investigators have begun their testing."
detective josef,"This is so inconvenient, Irene.  They can make an exception for Jerome."
irene,I'm afraid not.
director josef,"I apologize, Jerome."
jerome,"It's not yor fault, Director.  If your predecessor were still around we may not be going to Gaspra at all. That's what I would call inconvenient."
jerome," What's with the plungers, Lamar?  What are you doing, opening a blood bank?"
lamar, The gentlemen of law enforcement are concerned that my testing methods may have been compromised.
jerome,Damn!!
lamar," Jesus--I'm sorry, Jerome."
jerome," You must be out of practise, Lamar."
lamar, I've got enough here.
jerome," Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes."
irene,So you didn't do it after all.
jerome, I guess somebody beat me to it.
detective hugo,That's the last.
investigator,Something's not right.
detective hugo, He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
investigator," No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again."
detective hugo,We don't have the manpower.
investigator,"Get it.  From outside, if you have to."
detective hugo,From what budget?
investigator, I'll take it out of your damn pension if you question my authority one more time!
director josef,Would you care to look--in the telescope?
investigator,"Thank you, no."
director josef, One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
investigator, You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
director josef,"Right now, your presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer is amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place."
investigator, In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
investigator," You see, Director, I prefer my microscope."
eugene,Where are we going?
jerome, I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
eugene, Again?
jerome, She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
eugene,I'm sure you'll be very convincing.
eugene,Where are you taking her?
jerome,Michael's.
jerome,Everybody goes there.
eugene, You may as well invite her here.
jerome, Will you be okay?
eugene,"Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself."
jerome, We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
eugene,How long?
jerome,"By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, ""How are you?""  Forty-five minutes later I reply, ""Not bad.  How are you?"""
eugene,I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
irene,What is this place?
jerome, Let me order for you.
irene,I'd better not.
jerome,"So sure of what you can't do.  Do you even know what it tastes like, Irene?"
michael,Take the side door.
detective," Check for lenses, hairpieces--"
irene,Why are we leaving?
jerome, Those checks take forever.
irene, Jerome!
irene,What about the car?
jerome, Let's walk.
irene,Who are they?
jerome, It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
irene,I can't.
jerome, Come on.
irene,My medication.  I left it back there.
jerome,"We'll get it later.  Irene, please."
investigator, You run a clean establishment.
michael,Are you a health inspector?
investigator, Do you recognize this man?
michael,My eyes aren't so good.
investigator,I bet.
hugo,Sir.
investigator, Did he hit you with his fist?
detective, More like a hammer.
investigator," Quick, clean his teeth."
irene," Are you trying to kill me?  Are you?! Don't you understand, I can't do that!"
jerome,You just did.
investigator, What are you waiting for?
detective hugo,Where do we start?
investigator,We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
detective," We caught them trying to flush these, Sir."
irene,So sure of what you can't do.
irene, What happened?
jerome,You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
irene, --if it came to it.
jerome,"But ""if it came to it"" then it couldn't have your--  How perfect does your child have to be?"
irene, You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--what you are?  Don't you get any satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
jerome,That's precisely what scaresme--that they won't do anything foolish or courageous or anything--worth a Goddamn.
hugo, My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
investigator, Why not?
hugo,These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
investigator,You worried about the cost?
hugo,Not that.
investigator," They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be more human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving."
detective,Don't touch that.  It's evidence.
detective hugo,Positive saliva match.  The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
investigator,So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
director josef, Twelve have a mission within the week.
investigator,This time I will supervise each test personally.
irene,What is it?
jerome,I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
irene,I'll miss you.
irene, --when you go away.
jerome,We could go together one day.
detective hugo,He's the only absentee.
director josef,A little nausea.  Quite common.
investigator,At least it's nothing contagious.
director josef, I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
irene, I'll call and let him know.
investigator,Let's not spoil the surprise.  I understand you can show us the way.
eugene,Hello?
eugene," I was never very good at it, remember?"
investigator," You don't know who he is, do you, Irene?"
investigator,You think you have problems?
irene, Jerome--?
eugene,"Hello, sweatheart.  Come on up."
eugene,Where's my kiss?
irene,Good to see you're feeling better.
eugene,"Now you're here.  Who are your ""friends""?"
irene,It's about the Director.
eugene, Again?
eugene,Forgive me for not getting up.
irene, Couldn't we do this another time?
investigator,I don't believe so.
detective hugo,This won't take a moment.
eugene, It's okay.  Maybe they can find out what I've got.
investigator,Mind if I take a leak?
eugene,As long as you don't do it in my closet.  Over there.
investigator, May I?
eugene,Clean the whole house if you want.
irene," Actually, the kitchen needs doing."
detective, Come quickly.  We have him.
jerome," How are you, Jerome?"
eugene,"Not bad, Jerome."
jerome,How the hell did you get here.
eugene, I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
jerome, Irene.
investigator, This can't be him.
detective hugo, We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
investigator, Luca could still be an accomplice.
mission commander,"--Finally, I'd like to welcome Navigator Morrow on his debut mission--if we get lost out there, nobody has a map of the heavens in his head like Jerome."
mission commander, Gaspra--how could something so ugly hold so many beautiful secrets?
mission commander,Enjoy your final evening with your families. We'll all be a year older when they see us next.  And don't be late tomorrow.  You don't want to miss this.
investigator, Hugo!  I've found him!
hugo,I've found him too.
investigator, What did you find?
detective hugo,It's not exactly him.
investigator, Where did you get this?
detective hugo, But this man does share some common characteristics with your suspect.  Not so many but enough.  It appears the eyelash has a brother--of a kind.
caesar,"So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent."
jerome,"Not yet, I'm afraid."
caesar,No?  What's keeping you?
jerome,I guess I'm a slow learner.
caesar,"I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit."
jerome,I'll see what I can do.
caesar,"And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know."
jerome," By the way, I left some trash in your locker."
caesar, I'll take care of it.
investigator,Vincent--
investigator,"Vincent, what are you running from?"
jerome, From Vincent.
investigator,"Has it been so long, you don't remember who I am?"
jerome," What are you doing here, Anton?"
anton,"I could ask you the same question.  I have a right to be here, you don't."
jerome,You almost sound like you believe that.
anton," Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go."
jerome, There are a few million miles to go yet.
anton, It's over.
jerome," Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?"
anton,It's for the best.
jerome," God, even you want to tell me what I can't do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing.  But you did, once."
jerome, Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
anton, You didn't beat me that day.  I beat myself.
jerome,Who are you trying to convince?
anton," I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight."
irene,Hello.
eugene, That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
irene,I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
eugene, He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
eugene,"Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do."
irene,What's wrong with him?
eugene, You have more in common than you know.
eugene,"But they say hisis already ten thousand beats overdue.  I have my doubts.  For all my gifts, they could never engineer me a heart like Vincent's."
anton," How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done any of this?"
jerome,Now is your chance to find out.
anton," Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!"
jerome, Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
anton,What other side?  How far do you want to go?! Do you want to drown us both?  How are we going to get back?!
jerome," You wanted to know how I did it.  That's how I did it, Anton.  I never saved anything for the swim back."
jerome," Here, take it."
jerome," If you're still interested, let me know."
irene," Sorry, the wind caught it."
jerome, A year is a long time.
irene,Not so long--just once around the sun.
eugene,I have your samples ready.
jerome, Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
eugene," No, but you might need them when you get back."
eugene,Everything you need to last you two lifetimes.
eugene,"There's an extra specimen.  I wish I could give it to her myself.  But then, you always were better at being me."
jerome, Why have you done this?
eugene, In case you get back before I do.
jerome,Where are you going?
eugene, I'm travelling too.
jerome,Thank you.
eugene,I got the better end of the deal.  I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
eugene, Not until you're upstairs.
jerome," What's this, Lamar?"
lamar,New policy.
lamar, Flight got you nervous?
jerome,"There's a problem, Lamar."
lamar," Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome?  He's a big fan of yours.  He wants to apply here."
jerome," Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--"
lamar," --Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do."
lamar,For future reference--  --righthanded men don't hold it with their left.  It's just one of those things.
lamar," Have a safe trip, Vincent."
