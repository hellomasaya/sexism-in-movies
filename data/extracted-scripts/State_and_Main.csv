claire,"...I can't do it, Wally..."
walt,"Listen to me.  Elanora Duse was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, ""I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for.""  She said, ""I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist.  I'll do four shows a week.""  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?"

walt,Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
claire,...I...
walt,Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.

walt,"Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up..."
walt,"We're very upset with her.  Get someone to double for her, her tits, the tits scene.  Call L.A.  I want to see some pictures of the women's tits.  Of their tits."
walt,"You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch!  Can we replace him?"

costume designer,"You want to see the fireman's costumes? Cause I found this Moleskin for the collar, it's not black, but it looks black...  it's not brown, but..."

joe,"No, I don't..."
ann," He doesn't go back to the mill, he gets a second chance to go back to the firehouse..."
joe,What are you doing tonight?
ann,Me?
joe,Yes.
ann,"Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice..."
joe,...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.

carla,"Sure, what have you got?"
bob,What do you drink?
carla,Bourbon and milk.
bob,How old are you?
carla,I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
bob,Nice town that you've got here.
carla,"You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof."
bob,...wouldn't that be dangerous?
carla,...not if you've got something to hold on to.
uberto,"Because if you cannot tells me what is it, how I, how does I take a pictures of it?  Wally wants me, push in through the weendow..."

doug,"No.  No, but we're planning to."
doug,Yes.
marty,"I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat. My thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now: what is this you want Eight hundred Thousand Dollars to do what you're being paid to, you already signed you'd do...?  What is that?"

claire,We had a script conference.
joe,"I told her thank you very much, but it was inconvenient because, uh, because..."
ann,You can do it.
joe,Because I'd met someone else.
ann," Oh, okay."
joe,You believe that?
ann,I do if you do.
joe,But it's absurd.
ann,So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
joe,Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
ann,I used to go out with a politician.
joe,"You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?"
ann,Sure did.
joe,Why?
ann,Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
joe,Yes.

joe,Please...

morris,What happened to his finger?
ann,It was burnt.
morris,Mmm.
ann,And then it was really hurt.

morris,...how was it hurt?
ann,...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
joe,She realizes -- it was not the fire which hurt him...that the true hurt was her.  Was her...
ann,...yes.
joe,...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
ann,...yes.
joe,Has been wounded by her heat...by her infidelities...
jack,Anybody here seen Carla?
joe,"Because, because, because if it's about purity, it's...it's...and then, then, you don't need the nude scene."
ann,Because it's about purity...
joe,That's...that's exactly what it's about. Take...
ann,That's right...
joe,...take any two people...
jack,...anybody seen my daughter...?
joe,...take you and me...
walt, You have the new Old Mill pages?
walt," ...totally false...totally false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever..."
walt,Not now.
walt,"Oh, that's great.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world."
claire,What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
walt,"I, uh...  I just wanted to tell you that I am past chagrined, I'm mortified at the way you were spoken to..."
claire,I...
walt,An artist of your caliber...
claire,I'm only trying to...
walt,"I know what you are, I am so sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part."
claire,The minute I read that script I said...
walt,I know...
claire,"...she works with animals, she..."
walt,...yes...
claire,...she has a home...
walt,"...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community respects her.  When...?"

marty, I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY.  I JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
joe,"She doesn't show her tits!!! She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience..."
marty,The breasts symbolize motherhood...
joe,The movie's about purity.  So we don't show her breasts.  We show them to him. She keeps her back to the camera.
walt,...she keeps her back to the camera?
bill,It'll hurt the box-office.
joe,They know what her tits look like.
walt,Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse scene.
joe,I'm gonna nail it.

ann,"I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud."
joe,...how else can you talk?
ann,"No, that's true."
joe,"No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?"
ann,Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
joe,Is it...

bartender,He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him for some guy on the movie.
doc wilson,"Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with."
bartender,Big day last night.
doc wilson,Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
bartender,"Mornin', Carla."
carla,"Mornin', Uncle Ron."
doc wilson,"Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden, three times inna night."
bartender,"That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night."
doug,Who got their heads cut?
bartender,...some fella.  Orders a Manhattan.
doc wilson,What?
doug,Who got their heads cut?
doc wilson,"Uh, Bob Barrenger, fella, Cameraman..."
doug,You said three...
doc wilson,Did I?  I think you're mistaken.
carla,I wasn't in the car...
doug,We're going to s...
jack,"Doug, she says that she wasn't in the c..."
salesman,Yeah?
doug, I've got the wrong room.
marty,What is the...?
doug,Arrest him.
cal,For what...?
doug, Conspiracy in Statutory Rape.
marty,Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
doug,This young woman.
carla,"Nobody touched me, I was at home."
marty, Who is it raped you?
carla,Nobody.
marty,"Well, what's the beef?"
doug,"She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so..."
marty,You were in the car with Bob?
carla,No.
marty,Then what is the...?
marty,"Now what is this, you sonofabitch! Because if you haven't heard about the laws of Malicious Prosecution, you're about to.  DON'T FLINCH WHILE I'M TALKING TO YOU, YOU TWO BIT SPEEDTRAP FRAUD: There's an old saying, two scariest things in the world, a black man with a knife and a Jew with a lawyer.  Now, I am a lawyer, and I am the Jew, and you continue ONE MOMENT with this slanderous shit here in this public place, I'm going to have your ass over my mantleplace.  THE KID WAS NOT IN THE CAR, SHE SAYS THAT SHE WASN'T IN THE CAR, NO ONE SAYS SHE WASN'T IN THE CAR, NO ONE SAYS THAT SHE WAS IN THE CAR, YOU HAVE NO CORPUS AND YOU HAVE NO CASE, AND YOU KNOW IT.  SO I'M NOT PAYING PATSY WITH YOU HERE, YOU MOTHERFUCKER.  Look in my eyes: I made eleven million bucks last year and I don't like being trifled with.  Now I think that the better part of valor, though we've got your back up here...the better part of valor is to step away.  Or, before G-d, I will see you disbarred.  What do you say?  Have a cigar."
marty,It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
carla,I wasn't in the car.
marty,We know that you weren't.
claire,...because you treat me like a child...you treat me like a child... that's why I can't come...
carla,He took advantage of me.
marty,...upset and impressionable.  Get me the Mayor.
bob, ...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
marty,"...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered..."
bob, I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
marty,And a fantasy object...
doug, Tell him to get dressed...
cal,"Uh, sir..."
marty, Wally?
walt,"Look, Carla, this is a hard time for you.  Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...and we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you."
cal,"Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, but..."
walt,"Here this dream world has come to you. Now, you obviously have an active, a vivid imagination."
carla,Her...
bob,I swear that that woman in my room...
walt,"Be quiet, Bob.  A fertile mind.  Now we can use that kind of people in our work. Yes, we can.  Now, and this is what occurs to me... There's a part in the film...isn't that right, Marty?"
marty,Mmm.
walt,That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
marty," Yes, we'd love to have you... Now: we all have more important things to do, isn't that right...?"
jack,I knew she wasn't in the car.
marty,This has been just an unfortunate.
walt," It's the Mayor, he's saying..."
marty,Is he cool or angry?
mayor,"Well, these things happen.  Purpose of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of cigarettes Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary requirements..."
walt, So we just got lucky.
bill,"Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast.  He needs your confirmation on a request for money...?"
marty,And I need a drink.
walt," If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?"
bob,How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
walt,Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
bob,I'm ready!
walt,Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.
bob,What'll I do for fun?
marty,Whyn't you learn your lines?
bob,I know my lines...
walt,You do...?
bob,I just don't know what order they come in...
walt,"I tell you what, let's ditch these cockamamie locals.  I need to get outta here.  Go to some roadhouse tonight, just us.  Claire, Bob, siddown, have a bottle of wine.  Tell me where we're going, and let's go."
mayor,"Well, you must, where did they... where...I..."
doug,"Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt..."
doug,"Half a buck I'd close it down.  It's per...you know...it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls."
doug,Half a buck I'd put him in jail.
doug,"I had a witness, I would."
doug,"You know, the rape, to...even to the accident."
doug,What?
doug,Who's White?
doug, He saw the accident...?
doug,He saw the girl in the car...
sherry,Don't you touch that... I want them gone.
mayor,I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
sherry,I want them thrown in jail.
mayor,"Sherry, Sherry..."
joe,Good morning.
ann,Sleep well?
joe,"Yeah, you?"
ann,Oh yeah...
joe,"We could live up here, live up in the country."
ann,Now you're talking...
joe,And we could get up every morning...
ann,"...well, we do that anyway..."
joe,And come to the printshop.  You know why?
ann,Not without a rolltop desk.
joe,"Well, I could get a rolltop desk."
ann,Happen to know where there's one for sale.
joe,Well ain't you amazing.
ann,"Lookit that, up already."
joe,That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
tv reporter,"Where Movie Star Bob Barrenger, fresh from his troubles with the law last year..."
marty,"You better make sure you got your facts straight, pal, cause, you step off the line and I'm going to sue you personally for..."
trooper,We're looking for a Joseph Turner White.
marty,"Oh, good, yes.  Good morning.  Where are you taking Mr. Barrenger?"
trooper,We are looking for a Mr. Joseph Turner White?
marty,What are you doing with Mr. Barrenger?
doug,He's under arrest.
marty,"Oh, good.  I'm his lawyer...and you must be Perry Mason.  Guess what, you're about one-half step from a world of hurt...how diverting...the Mayor's gonna have your ass.  Can I watch?"
doug,"Well, you guess what.  The Mayor sent me.  I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of..."
marty,"...a history of nothing, he was acquitted."
doug,"Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend.  I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion..."
marty,"You've got nothing, you don't have a witness..."
doug,And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
marty,He told you that!?
doug,He didn't have to tell.
marty,I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
doug,"Oh, you're his attorney, too?"
marty,"Later for you, pal."
doug,Okay.
marty,"Bobby, don't say anything."
bob,Nothing happened.
doug,We'll see about that at the inquest.
marty,"Yeah, hi, pal.  I need to talk to you."
ann,What is it all about?
joe,I saw...
marty,"How do they know that, you told them?"
joe,No.
marty,What did you say to them?
joe,I didn't say anything to them.
marty,How do you know you saw it?
joe,I don't know.
marty,"Well, then, you didn't see it, right?"
joe,I don't...
marty,You didn't see it...
joe,I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
joe," I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a..."
marty,What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses?
joe,I...
marty,You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
ann,...he's going to give you a couple of minutes.
joe,What am I gonna do?
ann,You got to tell 'em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
joe,"I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I tell them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll... it'll ruin his career..."
ann,But that's what happened.
joe,But it'll stop the movie.
ann,Maybe they'll be other movies.
joe,They'll...they'll blackball me.
ann,"Carla was in the car, right?"
joe,I...I think that's right.
ann,...you think that's right...
joe,What'm I gonna do?
cal,Lotta hubbub on the street.  I'm taking you the back way.
walt, Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
joe,You want me to lie.
walt,"To the contrary.  I want you to tell the truth.  And be part of your world.  I got a five picture deal with the studio.  And you stick with me.  You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll direct the third one.  You are a part of this world.  You have to do the right thing: we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, literally is at our door.  You have to stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the bottom line.  You have to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in the car."
cal,...Joseph Turner White...
bailiff,"Hear ye, hear ye.  Sixth District Court. And for the county of Kadona, State of Vermont, the honorable James Addison Flynn presiding.  All those having business before this court, draw forward and you will be heard."
judge,Please...Mr. White?  This is a simple matter of...
bailiff,Do you swear to tell the truth...
tv reporter," we should say, formerly sleepy...Yes, yes, it's...yes, it's Claire Wellesley, and we're going to try to get a look at..."
scott,"...about his personal life, though I can tell you a few things about..."
joe,Would you please hold all calls to my room?
scott,Though I can tell you a few things about his dietary requirements.
doc wilson,"Mornin', Billy, where ya goin' in such a hurry?"
doc wilson,"Watch the curbs, now..."
joe,"I, uh...I'm leaving..."
doc wilson,Why?
joe,"I perjured myself.  I don't suppose you could help me with that, could you?  Turn back the clock, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my purity, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you?  But what is truth? Eh?  Ain't that the thing?  What is true?"
doc wilson,"It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's s'posed to point down to accentuate the genitals, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his ears?"
joe,Aren't you supposed to set an example for people?
doc wilson,Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands while they die.  What'd you say your problem was?
joe,"I just swore my life away, back in that..."
doc wilson," Mornin', Chessy, how's the back?"
joe,"I ruined my life.  Isn't that funny, that you can actually do it in one moment just like they say.  I ruined my life back in that courthouse."

station master,"Mornin', judge, what brings you here?"
judge,"I'm s'posed to hear some deposition, some fool saw the accident last night."
joe,...the courthouse burnt down...?
station master,"Yep.  Courthouse burnt down, 1960.  Part of a spate of fires, Old Mill, Courthouse... S'posed to've been set by some deranged teenager."
ann,I thought you needed to get it out of your system.
sherry,"...a blight, a blight and an obscenity...that's good English, isn't it?  How's that for entertainment?"
ann,What are you going to do?
joe,I'm going to tell the truth.
doug,"...and to exterminate this vermin, yes, I use that term, who have abused, who have desecrated, yes, the license granted to them by a gracious nation..."
tv reporter,...you want to clean up?
doug,"Yes, thank you."
technician,"Five minutes, and we're going live to the network."
doug," ...foreign, and un-American perversions of the Democratic process.  By those we have entrusted with our dreams..."
walt,Do something.
marty,"You tell me what to do, I'll do it."
walt,...and I was just paying off my house in Malibu...
joe,I'm out.
walt,I don't getcha.
joe,The girl was in the car.
walt,I treated you like a son or nephew.
joe,"It's no you, it's..."
walt,"No, what is it?"
joe,I have to tell the truth.
walt,...that's just so narrow...
joe,The girl was in the car.
walt,Then you're finished in show business.
joe,So be it.
walt,And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
joe,For what cause?
walt,"I don't need a cause, just a lawyer."
howie,I'm a lawyer.
marty,Howie...
howie,Yeah?
marty,What are you doing here?
howie,What am I doing here is I just flew seven hours cause you asked me here.
walt,What for?
howie," For this...I hope you need it, cause it's coming outta your budget..."
marty,Hi.
doug,I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
marty,I....
doug,"...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could possibly make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath..."
marty,Eight-hundred thousand dollars in cash.
doug,And what was it you wanted to say?
marty,Gut Yuntif.
joe, I've come to give myself up...
judge,"Well give yourself up to someone else. I'm gonna get in some golf.  Hiya, Annie.  Give yourself up to her."
doug,"I have learned a lesson.  And the lesson is this...that everybody needs a second chance.  You, me, and these fine, film people here.  You know, they have a high profile, but that doesn't mean they aren't deserving of our trust, and of our respect. You know, I think there is a lesson here, and the lesson is this: it is a lesson of Tolerance...and, as we look at this industry, at this clean, American industry, and as I begin my campaign for congress..."
