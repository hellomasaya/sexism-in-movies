bill,"I have no idea. I thought he was out of town. TOM Jen, I gave you specific orders to get some handlers and keep Brad locked down until after the announcement. JEN I did! They flew to the ranch in Maui last night! TOM Maui?! Wasn't he at the villa in South Hampton? BILL I thought he was at the chalet in Aspen."
brad,"That's old school. Pops, you got to keep your pimp hand strong. CUT TO:"

bill," Dammit, Brad, stop acting like a gang member. You're from Malibu, you live in a nice home... BESS With nice maids! DR. FELDMAN Bill, Bess, go to your happy places. Bill sits back, frustrated. DR. FELDMAN What are your goals, B-Rad?    What do you want out of life? BRAD To be the biggest rapper dere ever was! See, I got something to say, and I need the world to hear it. I'm the shiznit. I'll buy y'all cars! DR. FELDMAN I see. And when did you first start feeling like you were this... shiznit? BRAD Oh, damn... way back in the day.

brett,"It'll be perfectly safe. BILL How does it work? JEN We hire actors to play gangsters. TOM They car-jack Brad,     then take him on a 'tour' of the     'hood... give him a little taste     of what thug life's really like.      It might just scare the black out     of him. "
brad,"Why didn't you stop him? MONSTER I tried, yo! BRAD How many did he do? MOCHA Like twelve, thirteen, I don't know! BRAD Damn. Twelve Frapachizzo's. Brotha's caffeined out. Move aside. "

tom,"Okay, so here's the story -- it's your basic kidnapping... SEAN So we hold him for ransom? TOM Right.   But when you see   him acting ghetto and all, it    pisses you off  so much, you tour   him around the 'hood to show    him what things are really like. "
pj,"We can handle ourselves. Come on, man, it's the ultimate acting challenge. SEAN You know what really chaps  my ass? After years of training and  study, the only parts they'll give  us are gangbangers. Just once I'd   like to play a character who has  decent grammar and doesn't wear Timberlands.

PJ In the meantime, how about hooking a brother up with a Pepsi and some fries? SHONDRA Shut up, stupid. SEAN Do this, Shondra. You'll get some real money so you can quit this minimum wage crap and start up your business. SHONDRA What you payin'? SEAN A grand. SHONDRA Make it trey, we on. "
pj,"Glocks, Uzis, Tec-9s... PJ takes off the cap to wipe his brow, revealing that his hair has been braided into cornrows. SEAN What the hell is that? PJ Oh, my hair? Shondra just did it.  What? You hate it? SEAN No. I just think it's a choice my character would have made. PJ Don't go there, Sean. You're just jealous you didn't think of it first. SEAN Whatever. DISSOLVE TO:"

pj,"We gonna go call yo daddy. SEAN You better pray he home. If he not, you're one dusted trick! Sean, PJ and Shondra exit, slamming the door behind them."
sean,"Sure, Shondra, sorry. You're on. Go play good cop. We've gotta call Tom. Shondra rolls her eyes and heads back into the room."
shondra,"Look, I'm sorry about all that, it wasn't my idea. BRAD I thought you liked me. SHONDRA I do. BRAD Then how come you set me up? SHONDRA I had to. They... "

brad,"Straight up.   Trick didn't do nothin'. PJ Yo, what up with this? PJ pulls the receipt off of his 40. PJ If you jacked this, how come you got a receipt? Brad freezes.     They both stare at him. BRAD I stole that too! CUT TO:"
brad,"I'm sorry, y'all, but this is just who I am. I'm a rapper straight- up. SEAN AND PJ Wigga, please! BRAD No, for real. I can rap about anything.  You think you got mad skills, huh? Well, we'll see about dat."
sean,This is definitely gonna do it. PJ Pay day! They pound and follow Brad into the club. CUT TO:
brad,"Finally, a place where I feel at home. PJ  Get yo' ass in there. Brad boldly fist-shakes jaw-dropped patrons as he wades through the crowd, AD LIBBING ""Whassup?"" and ""Pardon me, homey."""
on stage,"DROP finishes and the MC brings up STEEL and YOUNG DRE, announcing the Battle Rap Competition. Steel and Young Dre battle -- both are top-notch. At every insult, the crowd ROARS."
tec,"Y'all been busy, huh? SHONDRA Too busy for you. TEC You been gettin' busy? SHONDRA Hell no. TEC Come on, girl, I'm cool.    Just tell me who it is. SHONDRA All you need to know is that it ain't you, okay?"
tec,"You know, you ain't shit, Shondra. You're just a chickenhead, and that's all you'll ever be. Just then, Brad walks up, grinning like a fool. BRAD What up, girl?! He gives her a sloppy kiss on the cheek. SHONDRA You a'ight? "
brad,"Damn, man. Don't you know how to treat a lady? That's not nice. SHONDRA Brad, don't -- TEC It's cool, Shondra.      The brutha's right. Tec releases Shondra's arm and immediately grabs Brad by the throat and hangs him over the balcony. TEC Didn't yo mama teach you to mind you own bizness? BRAD  Don't be hatin'."
shondra,"Don't do it, Tec! BRAD Auuuuuuuuu! Tec feels everyone looking at him. Now is not the time. He releases Brad and composes himself. TEC Y'all both gonna be sorry. Tec stalks off. SHONDRA You alright? "
sean,"Yo! Sean bumps the DJ table. A vicious look from the DJ, as Sean tries to play it off. The MC just looks at him disdainfully. PJ Uh... My boy want Young Dre next. The MC looks them over... MC Hell, nah... SEAN Maybe a C-Note would open some... equal opportunities? MC  Hey playa... You got any Will Smith back there? The MC just looks at him..."
brad,"Shondra, I gots to do 'dis. this is my shot. I gotta prove myself. Shondra can't argue. Brad starts to the stage. A WAVE OF SHOCK, as the crowd realizes who B-rad actually is. SHONDRA This is gonna be like an episode of 'Oz.' Brad gets his game face on and walks the gauntlet on his way to the stage -- an imposing path of intimidating looks. "
sean,"He thinks y'all belong down here in the 'hood with us brothas, seein' how you so 'down' and all. PJ So, I guess that means we got to ice your punk ass. BRAD I don't care no more. I got nothin' to live for. Go ahead and smoke me. Brad gets in the car. Sean and PJ look at each other -- this isn't what they expected. CUT TO:"

57b.,"MALIBU'S MOST WANTED - Rev. 1/29/03 A50   CONTINUED:     Hmmm, garbage. That's making me hungry. Peace out. The Rat runs off. Brad sighs, flops back down on the bed, utterly depressed. CUT TO:"
brad,But you heard 'em laughing.   I ain't nothin' but a busta. SHONDRA They just don't understand you. None of them know how hardcore it is up in... Malibu. BRAD 
pj,"But we got big a problem here. SHONDRA Until I see my money, it's your problem. Sean and PJ exit quickly. CUT TO:"
sean,"Why you talkin' crazy? BRAD  No.   You down, right PJ, er, Tree? PJ That's right, Bloodbath, he's very down. As down as they come. Suddenly, Tec jumps up, yanks Brad's door open and shoves a Nine in his side."

tec,What should we do with this Bloodbath and his friends? SEAN 
tec,"The dawg who's down with bitches and hoes? Hell yeah, I've heard of him. Just 'cause I live down here you think I'm ignorant? PJ We didn't say that, brother. TEC A'ight then.  Let's roll. CUT TO:"

Tec's pinned down behind the dumpster. He's without a weapon, and Rollin' G's are FOCUSING their FIRE on him. 8-BALL We're tryin', man, but they're too strapped. DEUCE What the hell we gonna do? BRAD Punks.   Gimme dem gats. Brad grabs the Uzis and rolls out from under the car. "
brad,"It's safe now, y'all. Tec emerges from behind the dumpster. The crew rolls out from under the car, followed by Sean and PJ. They look at Brad in awe. They're impressed. TEC That was ill!    Y'all definitely got juice. He offers his fist to Brad.        They pound. TEC Where'd you learn that shit? BRAD Damn.   Jus' MTV."

bill,"I didn't know anything about that. You've got to believe me, that was not part of the plan. BRAD What was the plan? Send me down here to scare me white? BILL It was stupid, I know. I thought I'd tried everything... I just didn't know how to deal with you anymore. BRAD You've never known how to deal with me 'cause you don't know me, and you never cared to find out. And now that your election's on the line, that's when you take a stand? That's bullshit, Pops. Look at me, 'cause this is who I am, and if you can't accept that, then I'll walk out that door, never see your sorry-ass again. Shondra, Tec, all the I-9's and Brad's posse slowly turn from Brad to Bill, completely caught in the moment, waiting for his response. BILL I'm not proud of myself, Brad. I made a lot of mistakes, and I know I wasn't there for you, and I can't change that, but I always loved you and still do... "
brad,"I can deal with a little more of that reality. They kiss again, then Brad breaks it. BRAD Wait a minute. You said two things was real. What was the other? Shondra smiles as we... SLAM TO: 91   CLOSEUP ON BIG BOY                                              91 BIG BOY What up, Shondra?"
