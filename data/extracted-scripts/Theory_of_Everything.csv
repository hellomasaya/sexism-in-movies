Speaker,Dialogue
shooting script,NOVEMBER 2013
brian,First to find a drink.
stephen,"More your field, I think."
brian,You'd better decide on your subject. I'm serious--they'll boot you out.
diana,"Scientists! Don't worry. We don't have to stay long. Looks mortifyingly dull.  Be right back, okay? Okay?"
stephen,I applied for a job.
brian,Did you?
stephen,Civil Service.
brian,"Well, it's a back-up plan--in your case not a bad idea. Did they accept you?"
stephen,"Unfortunately, that I'll never know. Morning of their exam, I..."
brian,"- slept in. Well, thank Christ, the world has lost a promising pay- clerk."
stephen,I was going to ask you.
brian,"Actually--I think she's--yes-- Basil's sister. Wilde--Jane Wilde.  ""So. You like for me I introduce?"""
diana,That's better.
jane,Who is that guy?
diana," Oh, there's David. Come on."
stephen,Hello.
jane,Hello.
stephen,Science?
jane,Arts.
stephen,Cosmologist. I'm a cosmologist.
jane,What's a cosmologist?
stephen,"It's a kind of religion--for intelligent atheists.  You're not religious, are you?"
jane,C of E. Church of England.
stephen, I suppose someone has to be.
jane,So--what do cosmologists worship then?
stephen, A single unifying equation that explains everything in the universe.
jane, Really? So what's the equation?
stephen,That is the question.
jane,Why didn't you stay at Oxford?
stephen,My finals papers were such a shambles the examiners called me in for a 'Viva' and I told them -
jane,What's a viva?
stephen,"A mildly terrifying face-to-face thingy. An interrogation. So I told them that if they gave me a 2nd class degree I'd stay with them and do my research at Oxford, but if they gave me the 1st I needed to get into Cambridge, then they'd never have to see me again."
jane,They gave you the 1st.
stephen,They gave me the 1st.
diana,This party is officially deceased! Come on--I've fixed you up a ride home.
jane,"Well, I hope you find your equation."
sciama,"A little challenge for you all, as you embark on your separate doctoral journeys -  - whatever they may be, Mr Hawking -"
brian, This is going to hospitalize me.
brian,"Oh come on, get up. How many have you got?"
stephen,"Morning, Brian."
brian,"Afternoon, Stephen. Where are they? Where are you hiding them? Your answers."
stephen,"Brian, I have no idea what you're talking about."
brian,How many of Sciama's questions have you done?
stephen,None.
brian,You liar!
stephen,I was going do them later.
brian,Later? You mean you haven't even started?
stephen,Yes.
brian,"Oh, good. Thought maybe you'd slept through the induction or something."
stephen, Bri-?
brian,What?
stephen,Can you whip on some Wagner?
brian,Sod off.
sciama, ...that's just--baffling.
stephen,Sorry.
sciama,"Train timetables? Stephen, these are totally unacceptable--they expired a month ago."
stephen,Sorry. It's on the back. Had a little accident.
sciama,Well...I see...well thank God. Well done Stephen.
brian, Nine?
stephen,"Full, give me twenty - One, drive! - Two, drive! - Three, big legs! - Four, press! - Five, boom! - Hook, send! - Catch, big send! - Hold at 32! - Big legs, Brian! - Big legs! "
brian, You! - complete! - and! - utter! bastard!
carter,"No, no, listen, listen, pay attention. A man enters a lift, wanting to go to the fiftieth floor but only gets as far as the 46th. Why?"
brian, Erm - there was a naked girl in the lift.
ellis,No--we give up. No idea.
stephen,He was too short to reach the button for the fiftieth floor.
brian,"Okay, I've got one. Okay, okay-- A naked girl enters a lift -"
stephen, Do you have change for the pay- phone?
barman,Sure.
stephen,Uh - my napkin just walked in.
jane,Hello.
stephen,What's the probability?
jane,Reasonably low.  Uh - this is - Stephen.
stephen,Croquet. Do you play croquet?
jane, Um. Not recently.
stephen,Sunday morning?
jane,I'm actually busy Sunday mornings.
stephen,Oh. Of course.  Him.
sciama,"Stephen, come in. Sit down. Now-- we're all rather concerned--about your choice of subject. What it's going to be."
stephen,I can't decide.
sciama,Any ideas?
stephen,Umm-- No.
sciama,Come with me.
sciama,"This lab is where JJ Thomson discovered the electron, where Rutherford split the atom. One of the great rewards of this job is that you never know from where the next great leap forward is going to come, or from whom."
jane,So I gather you've never been to church?
stephen,Once upon a time.
jane,Tempted to convert?
stephen,I have a problem with the whole Celestial Dictator premise. What are you doing for lunch? Ma makes a cracking roast.
frank hawking,And Jane? What are you studying?
jane,"Arts. Languages, poetry. I'm thinking of doing a PhD eventually."
frank hawking,Oh? What in?
jane, Medieval poetry of the Iberian Peninsula.
frank hawking,"Arts. So, what painters do you like?"
jane,"Well, I like--Turner..."
frank hawking,Really? Turner? To me they all look as if they've been left out in the rain.
jane,And...William Blake.
phillipa,Good heavens. Surely not!
frank hawking, Will you try my elderflower wine?
jane,"Yes, please."
stephen," Don't touch it, don't touch it Jane."
frank hawking,Stephen doesn't like my homemade wine. Philistine.  If you don't watch out I'll send you back with a couple of bottles.
phillipa,"So Stephen, you've been to church with a good woman. Are you feeling holier than thou?"
stephen,"Positively saintly, thank you."
jane, You've never said why you don't believe in God.
stephen,A physicist can't allow his calculations to be muddled by a belief in a supernatural creator.
jane,Sounds less of an argument against God than against physicists.
frank hawking, Jane? Light meat or dark?
jane,"Er - light, please."
stephen,I'll wing it. As usual.
phillipa,Boooo.
frank hawking,How plucky of you.
phillipa,"Ohh, fowl play! Fowl play."
stephen,Stop egging him on!
frank hawking,It's so nicely cocked.
isobel, Don't worry about them. They're pun mad.
jane,That's okay -  - the breast is yet to come.
frank hawking,"HA! Marvelous! Very good. ""The breast is yet to come!"" Indeed it is! Well done."
stephen,Oh! - I'm inviting Jane to be my partner for the May Ball.
jane,"Should we dance, do you think?"
stephen,"Oh, no, no. Happy to observe the phenomenon--but I can't possibly imagine participating."
jane,"I absolutely agree. I mean, who would want to dance?"
stephen,"No, I'm quite serious. I don't dance."
jane, Yes...
stephen,Do you know why?
jane,Why?
stephen,"""TIDE."""
jane,The washing powder?
stephen,The fluorescence in the washing powder is caught by the UV light.
jane,Why do you know that?
stephen," When stars are born and when they die, they emit UV radiation. So if we could see the night sky in ultraviolet light, almost all the stars would disappear--and all we'd see would be these spectacular births and deaths. And I reckon-- it would look a little -"
jane,- like that.
stephen,So why...  ...why...
jane,Why?
stephen,Why medieval Spanish poetry?
jane, I suppose I like to time travel.
stephen,And what particular time periods do you visit?
jane,The Twenties is always fun.
stephen,The roaring twenties! Cheers!
jane,"""Seek then/ No learning/ from Starry Men!/ Who follow with Optic Glass/ The Whirling Ways of Stars that Pass."""
stephen,Ouch.
jane,Was it -
stephen,A smashing time actually. Spacetime was born.
jane,Spacetime...
stephen,"Space and Time finally got together. People always thought they were too dissimilar, couldn't possibly work out. But then along comes Einstein, the ultimate match- maker, and decided that space and time, not only had a future, but had been married all along."
jane,The perfect couple!
stephen,"Well that's astonishing, isn't it?"
jane," ""In the beginning was the heaven and the earth, and the earth was without form, and darkness-- darkness was upon the face of the deep."""
stephen,Would you dance with me?
roger penrose,"So what do we know? Let me rephrase that--what do the equations tell us, finally?"
stephen, I wonder what would happen--if--I wonder what would happen--
sciama,Go on. If?
stephen,If you applied Penrose's theory about black holes to--the entire universe?
stephen,"If--if--so--If--Einstein is right, if--general relativity is correct, then the universe is expanding, yes? -"
jane,- Alright -
stephen,"- which means - that--if you reverse time, the universe would get smaller and smaller. So what if--if I reverse the process all the way to see what happened at the beginning of Time itself? The universe, smaller and smaller, denser and denser, hotter and hotter as we approach its birth. Wind back the clock..."
jane,Winding back the clock!
stephen, Is that what you're doing?
jane,That's what I'm doing.
stephen,"Well keep winding! You've got quite a way to go. Keep winding, Jane! Keep winding...back to the beginning of Time...Keep winding..."
sciama,A singularity.
stephen,A spacetime singularity. At the beginning of time.
sciama, Keep going.
stephen,"Keep going? You mean go further back, Professor? Before the universe began?"
sciama,Keep going. Develop the mathematics.
stephen,I don't know how.
stephen,What is it? What's wrong with me?
senior doctor,It's called motor neuron disease.
stephen,What's that?
senior doctor,"It's a progressive neurological disorder that destroys the cells in the brain that control essential muscle activity such as speaking, walking--breathing-- swallowing. The signals that muscles must receive in order to move are disrupted, cut off. The result is--gradual muscle decay, a wasting away. Eventually, the ability to control voluntary movement is--lost--entirely."
stephen,Is--is--is there a cure? Some--? Is--can you--?
senior doctor,Improvement should not be expected. 
stephen,Wait! What about--what about the brain?
senior doctor,The brain isn't affected. Your thoughts won't change--it's just-
stephen,What?
senior doctor,Eventually--no-one will know what they are.  Ever so sorry.
brian, Is he up yet? THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   29
brian,"""Welcome--to this week's episode of The Natural World, where we explain the extraordinary hibernation patterns of the rare Cambridge Physicist--seen here in his wonderful plumage..."""
stephen,"I have a disease, Bri."
brian," Is it--venereal, Stephen?"
stephen,No. Motor neuron disease. Lou Gehrig's Disease. He was a baseball player.
brian,"Motor what? Sorry, I'm lagging behind in my pioneering work on rare automotive and baseball diseases. Come on, let's go to the pub."
stephen," Sounds strange, doesn't it, when you say it out loud."
brian,What? I--I don't understand. It's not possible! It's ridiculous! 
stephen,Will you leave me Brian?
brian,"I'm sorry, look, I was just being a berk...I'm so..."
bedder,Stephen! Phone for you! It's a girl.
brian,"Right. OK. So--see you soon, yeah?"
bedder, She's waiting.
jane,Stephen? Hi. It's me.  Stephen?
jane,STEPHEN?!  STEPHEN! THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   31
brian,Jane!
jane,Brian--have you seen Stephen?
brian,"Jane, have a seat."
jane,What is it?
brian,I understand you saw him. You know he was in hospital...
jane,Something educational?
jane,Are you close?
stephen,"It's some integer of zero, but I'm not there yet."
jane,STEPHEN?
stephen,You just missed him. He was here earlier.
jane,Don't do this.
stephen,What?
jane,Cut me off.
stephen,Go.
jane,Teach me croquet.  What is this?
stephen,"I believe you poetry under- graduate types call it...""a slough of despond."""
jane,If you don't get up and play a game with me I won't come back here again. Ever.
stephen,My turn.
stephen,Go away.
jane,Are you going to talk about this or not?
stephen,There's nothing to say-- just...
jane,Is that what you want?
stephen,That's what I want. I haven't got time for you. So - if you care about me at all - go.
jane,I can't.
stephen,I've got two years. I need to work.
jane,I can't.
stephen,You've--you've leapt to--a false conclusion...
jane,"My chances are probably -  - well, some ""integer of zero"", but I think we can make a go of this. I want us to be together, for as long as we've got. And if that's not very long then - well, that's just how it is. It will have to do."
stephen,You don't realise what's coming. It'll affect everything.
jane,Your glasses are always dirty.
stephen, Yes. It is.
sciama,"...the solutions to the Schrodinger equation must vanish at the boundary of the box, so we have..."
stephen, Time!
sciama,"Time. That's your subject? Any aspect of it, in particular?"
stephen,Time.
frank hawking,"You don't realize what lies ahead. His life is going to be very short. So. Be careful. Science is against you. And it's not going to be a fight, Jane. It's going to be a very heavy defeat. For all of us."
jane,I know--I know what you all think. That I don't look a terribly strong person. But I love him. And he loves me. We're going to fight this illness--all of us.
jane,Ready. Good luck. Are you sure I can't drive you?
sciama,Come in Stephen.
stephen, Fine.
sciama,Would you like to sit down?
stephen,No thankyou.
sciama,So. Chapters One--full of holes and lacks mathematical support.  Professor Thorne?
kip thorne,Chapter Two--not really original-- uses a lot of Roger's ideas.
penrose,Well at least you run with them. Chapter Three? Too many unanswered questions.
sciama,But Four?
kip thorne,A spacetime singularity?
sciama,"Brilliant. It's brilliant Stephen. So all that remains to be said is...well done. Or should I say, well done Doctor. And extraordinary theory."
stephen,Thankyou.
sciama,"So, what now?"
stephen,"Prove it. Prove...with a single equation, that Time has a beginning. Wouldn't that be nice Professor? One single elegant equation to explain everything?"
sciama,Yes. It would. It would indeed.
jane,TO DOCTOR-
brian,-Who?
jane,To Doctor Stephen Hawking.
brian,"What's astonishing is that for Stephen and I, ""work"" was the worst four-letter word, the worst.  Unbelievable levels of sloth!"
jane, Stephen?
stephen,I'm sorry.
stephen,It's okay Robert.
stephen,This--is--temporary.
jane,Of course.
stephen,"Well, it's convenient for breakfast!"
jane," Excuse me, did you say something?"
stephen,I said--thankyou.
stephen,Go Jane.
jane,One second.
stephen,JANE?
jane,Are you alright?
stephen, I've got an idea. I've got an idea Jane!
sciama,"Kip! He's done it, Kip! He's -"
kip thorne,What is it?
sciama,Stephen! He's changed everything!
sciama,All set?
char 1,"Look at him. It's awful, in't it? He's falling apart at the seams."
jane, Good luck!
sciama,Ready or not.
stephen," ...allowing us to predict that some particles can in fact escape a black hole. Black holes aren't black at all, but glow with heat radiation."
sciama, He's unifying Relativity--plus Quantum Mechanics and Thermodynamics. For the first time.
john taylor, Thermodynamics? Last used to describe the steam engine.
stephen,"In other words--the steady emission of heat energy causes black holes to slowly lose mass, they evaporate, eventually disappearing in a spectacular explosion. So..."
brian,"No,no! What he's saying is--just as a hot body loses heat--right? -"
rees,Second law of thermodynamics.
brian,- that a black hole -
rees,- thanks -
brian,"- that if it is losing particles, then, then over time -"
stephen,- it must eventually disappear.
brian,Gone!   From nothing--into nothing.
rees,You owe me another beer.
carter,Me too.
brian,He's just told us that -  - Time! Had a beginning! He shown us how -
ellis, - the universe was born and how it will end.
rees,Bang.
brian,"Crunch!  It's beautiful! It's racy! It's totally, totally -"
john taylor,I'm afraid--this is complete nonsense. It's preposterous.
stephen,Was it something I said?
sciama,I-
khalatnikov,STOP! Please.
brian,BASTARDS!
stephen,Big legs! Big legs Brian!
brian,"So, tell me, this Motor Neuron Disease, does it effect, y'know..."
stephen,What?
brian,Everything..?
stephen,Different system. Automatic.
brian,"That's kinda wonderful, actually. And it explains a great deal about men."
jane,Get in the car! Get! In! The Car! Come on! Let's go see Gran and Grandad!
isobel,Isn't it marvellous? We can rent it every year!
jane,"Yes. I see. But what about all the steps, Frank?"
frank hawking,"Oh, it's nothing. The climb is absolutely worth it. You get the luggage."
frank hawking,Oh--Rain?--Falling?--Rain Falling Down?--Shivering?--Uhhhrrrrr---
isobel,Very cold...
jane,He needs to see a doctor. This keeps happening!
stephen,No doctors!
frank hawking,"Very well, no doctors."
jane,I need help. I keep--I keep looking for a way-- to make this work--but I can't find it.
stephen, We're fine--we're just a normal family.
jane, WE'RE NOT A NORMAL FAMILY!!! We're not a normal family.
jane, Thanks.
jane,Ready?
robert,Surprise! Look Daddy Look!
jane,It's an electric wheelchair. We can take it back--if you don't like it.
sciama,I don't get it. You've spent years assuming Black Holes exist--you believe Cygnus X-1 will turn out to be the first black hole we can actually observe==and yet you bet Kip Thorne that it isn't a black hole?
stephen," Yes, a magazine subscription."
sciama,Why would you bet against yourself? 
stephen,"Pent-house. That way even if I'm wrong, I still win!"
sciama,Penthouse?
beryl,Jane--Jane? Jane? Jane! STOP!
jane,Mum--I think that is possibly the most English thing anyone has ever said.
beryl,Maybe so.
jane,I used to love singing.
beryl,You're very good at it.
jane,I don't know about that.
beryl,Go.  It's one hour a week.
jonathan,"Oh, hello."
jane,Hello.
jonathan,Are you here to sing?
jane,I um--I just came to--
jonathan,Soprano? Soprano.
jane,I wish.
jonathan,Mezzo?
jane, Alto.
jonathan,Well--Just what we need.  Where have you been hiding?
jane,Good question.
jonathan,"Well, you're here now. And just in time."
jane, Am I?
jonathan,Yes. So tell me.  Chopin! Yes? Your repertoire.
jane,I wouldn't call it a repertoire. Brahms--I know a little-
jonathan,Brahms! Wonderful. Perfect. We -
jane,"Well, I have sung--""Immer leiser."""
jonathan,"Ah! ""My sleep grows evermore peaceful."" Come on. Follow me. Come on. Let me hear you. Come on."
jonathan, Jonathan. Jonathan Hellyer Jones.
jane,Jane. Jane Hawking.
jonathan,"In C-sharp minor? The introduction, so lovely. From the top?"
jane,Now?
jonathan,"""Living on the edge.""  If you're not in the mood we could absolutely forget -"
jane,"No, no. No, no. Just let me remember the lyrics. In English."
jonathan,Fabulous.
jane,Okay.
jonathan,"Okay?  Two, three..."
jane, THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   56
jonathan,"Actually, no, I go for the Gospel of St. Mark."
jane,"None of that wishy-washy do-gooder stuff--Matthew, Luke."
jonathan,Exactly. With Mark you roll up your sleeves and get stuck in. No standing on the sidelines.
jane,Well I should be going.
jonathan,"Well met. Oh, and if your daughter would like those piano lessons."
jane,Absolutely. My husband loves music too.
jonathan,I could teach him as well.
jane,"Well, that's a long story. 'Night."
jane,Water.
jonathan, So - Stephen. Er - Jane tells me...
stephen, That was my - PhD thesis.
jonathan,Your...?
jane,PhD thesis.
stephen,My new project - disproves it.
jonathan,Disproves it? Really? 
stephen,What one believes - - is irrelevant--in physics.
jane,...in physics.
jonathan,"Oh, is that so?"
jane," Stephen's done a U-turn. The big new idea is that the universe has no boundaries at all. No boundaries, no beginning. No BEGINNING -"
jonathan,- no God? Really?  Fascinating. Because I'd understood you'd proven the need for a Creator. My mistake.
stephen,No. Mine.
jonathan, Yours. Your mistake?
jane,Stephen is looking for a single law that governs all the forces in the universe. So God must die.
jonathan,Why must God die? I don't see.
jane,"The two great pillars of physics ARE -  - Quantum Theory, the laws that govern the very small--electrons, particles so on--and General Relativity..."
jonathan,"Oh, yes - Einstein."
jane,...Einstein's theory.  Relativity...
jonathan,They're--different?
jane,"They don't remotely play by the same rules. Peas are chaotic, and don't behave predictably at all -"
jonathan,UNLIKE--POTATOES -
jane,Which you can set your watch by.
stephen, Very good.
jane,"If the world were all potatoes, easy--you could trace a precise beginning, as Stephen once did, a moment of Creation. Hallelujah, God lives. "
stephen,Tits up.
jane,Tits up. Haywire. Becomes a Godless mess.
jonathan,"Oh, dear."
jane,"Einstein hated peas, Quantum Theory. ""God doesn't play dice with the universe"", he said."
stephen,Seems he not only plays dice -
jane,Seems he not only plays dice -
stephen,- he throws them - where we can't find them. 
jane,- he throws them -
jonathan,- where we can't find them. How inconvenient!
jane,Stephen's swapped his telescope  Order for chaos--hoping to find a law to cover both.
jonathan,"Looking for ""the world in a grain of sand."""
jane,God is back on the endangered species list.
jonathan,I expect he'll cope.
stephen,But physics--is back in business.
jane,Physics is back in business. Stephen thinks it a fair exchange.
stephen, It's the final--challenge. We'll know everything.
jonathan,The final challenge?
jane, More wine?
jonathan,"No, thank you."
jane, We'll know everything.
jonathan,"It was leukaemia. Coming up on a year ago. She fought it, I nursed her, but in the end... Music is my salvation. Teaching and playing. I've struggled with loneliness, of course. Tyranny of the empty room, all that. Music is a consolation, although my career... Well, I'm not very ambitious.  Is that a sin?"
stephen,Wrong guy to ask. THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   62
jane,Thank you for coming.
jonathan,"No. Thank you. It was wonderful.  And if--if there was anything I can do. To be of service. To you, your family. I have no children, no commitments. If I could help you, I believe I would find a purpose that would alleviate my own situation. It would be a privilege."
stephen,"I understand you need more help. And if there is - someone - who is prepared to offer it - I won't object, as long - as long as you continue to love me."
jane,Of course. For infinity.
jane,I have to tell you something.
jonathan,Is anything the matter?
jane,I'm um--I'm pregnant.
jonathan,Oh.  Congratulations are in order.
jane,Does it make a difference?
jonathan, Of course not.
frank hawking,"I've always supported you in your choice not to have home help, but now, you need a permanent solution. This--this current 'situation' can't go on. You need a proper live- in nurse immediately."
stephen,We have help.
frank hawking,You know what I'm talking about.
stephen, Can't afford--live-in nurse.
frank hawking,You can't afford to--  There must be a way. You need to find a way. For your family's sake. You're world famous -
stephen,For black holes--not rock concerts.
frank hawking,I believe it's urgent.
isobel,You know very well what I'm talking about.
jane,No. I don't.
isobel,"We do have a right to know. We have a right to know, Jane."
jane,Know what?!
isobel,"Whose child Timothy is. Stephen's, or Jonathan's?"
jane,That's what you think of me?
jonathan,I need to go. I can't...
jane,Please don't go.
jonathan,Everyone's talking. It's -
jane,So. What does it matter?
jonathan,"Well, there are other things too. I - I - just -  I have feelings for you."
jane,"I have feelings for you, too."
jonathan,Perhaps the right thing is for me to just--step back.
stephen,I've just been invited -
jane,Invited? Where?
stephen,Geneva.
jane,Geneva?
stephen,Students can accompany me.
jane,What students?
stephen,I know how much you hate -
jane,You know how much I hate -
stephen,- to fly.
jane,To fly. Yes.
stephen,I was thinking - that you and the CHILDREN -
jane,- Me and the children--go on?
stephen,could bring the car -
jane,- bring the car -
stephen,- meet me in Bayreuth -
jane,Bayreuth? How can I manage that? On my own?
stephen,Bring Jonathan.
jane,I doubt he would be willing.
stephen,Is--this okay?
jonathan,Well--I won't tell if you don't.
jonathon,Not too much--bearing in mind you have to drive.
stephen,Jane--needs--help.
jane,"And please please remember, 5 milligrams of Riluzole before and after the flight."
stephen, See you - in Bayreuth.
jane,Travel safely.
jane,Forty-nine...Fifty. Coming ready or not!
jane, What are you talking about?
swiss doctor, If we try to bring him round from the anaesthetic it is not sure he will survive resuscitation.
jane,Stephen must live! You have to bring him round from the anaesthetic!
swiss doctor,"Are you sure this is what you want? The only way of weaning him off the ventilator would be to give him a tracheotomy, a hole in the neck, by-passing the throat. He will never speak again."
jane,There's no question. Stephen must live. I will see he gets everything he needs. I will have him transferred back to Cambridge.
swiss doctor,He may not survive the journey.
jonathan,I'll step back.
jane,"Drive--safely, yes? Did you get everything in the car? His chair, equipment..."
english doctor,It'll take a miracle.
jane,She's here. Okay. Promise not to eat her alive...
elaine,"So then - Professor. How are you? My name is Elaine. I'm going to be your nurse, would you like that? No? Well- we'll work it out."
elaine, You're good. You want tea. What type of tea?
elaine, I think he's the most brilliant man I've ever met. You're very lucky.
jane,Thank you.
elaine,You must worship the ground beneath HIS -
jane,- wheels.
elaine,And he's the perfect patient. Looking after him is so much easier than other patients I've had. 
jane," You only do two shifts a week, Elaine."
technician,Almost there!
jane,How does it work?
technician,"A guy called Walt Woltosz invented the software. Uses a very simple interface that scans through the alphabet and allows each letter to be selected one by one. Using this technique, the Professor can expect to write at about four words per minute."
jane, Better than one a minute.
technician,"What I've done is--use components from a telephone answering system actually-- to convert the written text into synthesized speech. The voice sounds a bit robotic, but...  Okay. Shall we give it a try?"
stephen, My--name--is--Stee--ven--Hawking.
jane,"It's American! Oh, my Goodness.  Are there any other voices?"
technician,That's all they have at the moment. Is that a problem?
elaine,I think it's great!
stephen,Daisy. Daisy.  Give Me Your Answer Do.
stephen,"Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."
stephen,Ex-terminate..! Ex-terminate..! Ex-terminate..!
stephen,I will write. A Book.
jane,At four words a minute? About what?
stephen,Time...
stephen,"Only Time, whatever that may be, will tell."
elaine, Professor?
stephen,It is for a friend.
elaine,'Course it is. That's what they all say.
sciama,Oh. I'm sorry.
elaine,Next one?
jane,Elaine? Can we - ?
elaine,We're not quite finished--can you come back in ten minutes?
jane, 'GOD'? Do you really mean this?
stephen,Yes.  Of course.
jane,So you're acknowledging him?
stephen,HOWEVER --
jane,Did you just say something?
stephen,You - are - welcome.
jane, Will she?
stephen,Don't worry.
jane,America?  You always used to tell me when an invitation came in.
stephen, A-nother a-ward. What can you do?
jane,They said - two. We've had so many.
stephen,Be. Happy.
jane,I have loved you.  I did my best.
beryl,Remarkable. How is he?
jane,He wants to marry her.
beryl,Don't blame yourself. We're proud of you.
jane,I'm trying hard not to think of this as a failure.
beryl,But it wasn't a failure.
jane,"But it feels like it! It feels like it, Mum.  Was it inevitable?"
beryl,Perhaps too many people were drawn in?  What will Stephen do next?
jane," He's gone back to looking for his Theory Of Everything, his single equation. Well, it'll have to explain human relationships too."
beryl,All the unexpected forces... attractions...
jane,And vice versa.
beryl,Of course.
jane,Then add Time - Adversity -
beryl,Yes. Adversity over time --
jane,"- until the situation becomes unstable, heats up."
beryl,Bang!
jane,And the whole thing starts over. Whole new galaxies.
beryl,"Darling, I think we've cracked it. Shall we phone the Nobel committee now or shall we have another cup of tea first?"
female fan,Professor? Could you please sign a copy for me?
stephen,I cannot sign copies of my book-- but if you like--I could drive over it.
sciama,"Thankyou. I first met--the Professor--was it really 1963? Time- -where does it go? Back then, he was kind of annoying. "
guest 1,How have you been able to deal with all the physical challenges you face?
stephen,Can you hear me?  There are some things I cannot do. But. They are mostly the things I don't particularly want to do anyway.
guest 2,"Now you are recognized everywhere, how do you deal with all the attention?"
stephen,"I was stopped recently by a tourist in Cambridge who asked if I was 'the real Stephen Hawking.' I replied that I was not, and said the real one was--much better looking."
guest 3,In 1979 you talked about the possibility of a theory of everything being discovered before the end of the century.
stephen,I now predict -- that I was wrong.
guest 4,Is Time Travel possible?
stephen,I have experimental evidence that Time Travel is not possible. I gave a party for Time-Travellers but no- one came.
guest 5,"Professor Hawking, you have said you don't believe in God..."
stephen,It is clear that we are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies...
jane,It's from Stephen.  He's--he has invited--the children and I--to accompany him.
jonathan,Gosh.
jane,Your glasses are always dirty.
jane, I'll leave a card. There's a number you can call. They can install ramps in a day. It really would be helpful.
