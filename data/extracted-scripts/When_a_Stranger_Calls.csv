Speaker,Dialogue
wife,Where's the girl?
doctor,I only called her ten minutes ago --
wife, I made our reservation for 8:15. We're going to be late.
doctor,Here she is now.
jill,Dr. Minakis?
doctor,Mandrakis. It's okay. Everyone gets it wrong the first time. You're Jill? Come on in.
jill, Thank you.
wife,"I've written the number of the restaurant on the notepad by the phone.  If we aren't home in two hours, it means we've decided to go on to a movie and won't be back until after midnight. Is that all right?"
jill,Sure.
doctor, I've told my service to pick up any calls coming in to my office phone.
wife,The children are asleep upstairs -- first door on your left at the top of the landing. They're both just getting over a cold -- so try not to wake them.
jill,Okay.
wife,Do you have any questions?
wife,We have to go now. We're late.
doctor,Make yourself at home. The refrigerator's loaded.
wife, Goodbye.
doctor,We even have some low-fat yogurt.
doctor,Bye.
jill,Nancy?
jill,All right.
jill,"Yeah, I've been here for about an hour already."
jill,I guess... I haven't looked around very much.
jill,"No, they were asleep when I got here."
jill,"You didn't happen to talk to Billy today, did you?"
jill,Did he say anything about me?
jill,It's what I didn't do.
jill,"Do me a favor, Nance."
jill,Do you think you'll be talking with Billy some time tonight?
jill,That isn't what I had in mind.
jill,"Nancy, all you want to do is come over here and get drunk."
jill, Who? Me?
jill,I've got a lot of work to do. I don't want you coming over!
jill,You are my friend.
jill,"Listen, just give Billy the number here, but don't tell him I told you to. Okay?"
jill,"Okay, Nancy. Bye. And thank you."
jill,Hello?
jill,Billy?...
jill,What?
jill,Hello?
jill,Mrs. Mandrakis?
jill,Hello!
jill,Billy! I don't think this is very funny!
jill,...Who is this?
jill,"Hello, I'd like to speak to Dr. Mandrakis. This is his babysitter."
jill,Yes?
jill,Forty minutes?
jill, Okay. Thank you.
jill,"Hello, Operator? Can you get me the police?"
jill,"Yes!  No, not really."
jill,Please.
jill,"Hello, I've been getting phone calls, every fifteen minutes or so. I think it's a man. He's trying to scare me."
jill,That's right.
jill,No.
jill,No. He just keeps calling me. Sometimes he doesn't say anything.
jill,"No, I'm just the babysitter."
jill,Oh...
jill,What?
jill,"No, I... You're probably right. It's nothing to worry about."
jill,"No, the people I'm babysitting for might try to reach me."
jill,Okay. Thank you.
jill,Goodnight.
jill,Hello?
jill,I called you before... about the man who keeps calling me?
jill,He called me again.
jill,"No, he's out there somewhere."
jill,In the neighborhood. He's been watching me... through the windows.
jill,No. I know he's there.
jill,Yes.
jill,Yes. Everything.
jill,"Please, can't you help me? I'm all alone."
jill,He will call again! I know he will!
jill,3317 Oakridge Drive.
jill,But he never stays on that long! Sometimes he hangs up after just a couple of seconds.
jill,Jill Johnson.
jill,Yes.
jill,Okay.
jill,Thank you.
jill,Hello?
jill,I know. Who are you?
jill,I won't be here much longer. The doctor and his wife are coming home soon.
jill,Can you see me?
jill, I'm sorry I turned the lights down. It didn't work anyway. I can turn them back up if you like --
jill,Don't?  Is that what you wanted?
jill,What do you want?
jill,You don't know me. You don't know who I am or where I live. I'll get Dr. Mandrakis to drive me home. Him or the police.
jill,I want to talk to you.
jill,Leave me alone!
clifford,Are the parents here yet?
clifford,Christ!  What a homecoming!
garber,"We were only a block away when the call went out. When we got here, the guy was still waiting upstairs in the children's bedroom. He was covered with blood."
clifford,Blood?
garber,Not his own. The children had been dead for several hours.
clifford,Jesus...
garber,He'd been using an old phone in their bedroom that the parents had never had disconnected.
clifford,Who is he?
garber,We found a Merchant Seaman's card on him. He's English. Entered the country less than a week ago.
clifford,How about the babysitter?
garber,She's going to be all right.
master,So you're in business for yourself now.
clifford," Yes, sir, for the past three and a half years."
master,That's good.  And you'd heard about Curt Duncan's escape?
clifford,"Oh, yes."
master,Do you think the police will... find him?
clifford,I know they haven't assigned anyone to it specifically. It's an old case.
master, Can you find him?
clifford,"Yes. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not this week, but I'll find him."
master,He could be anywhere by now.
clifford,"I don't think so... because he's a foreigner. He'll come back to the city. After six years in confinement, it's the only place that's familiar to him. That's important."
master,A man murders two children in cold blood. A jury declares him insane. How could such a person not be?
master,He is sent to a state mental institution where the security is... less than perfect. And he escapes. It... it isn't fair.
mandrakis,A thing like that should never be allowed to happen again.
clifford,I couldn't agree with you more.
mandrakis,Go ahead then. My accountant will contact you.
clifford,Thank you.  How is Mrs. Mandrakis?
mandrakis,She is... unable to have any more children.
clifford,I'm sorry. Please give her my best.
mandrakis,Of course.
clifford,You gave him electric shock?
clifford,It says here thirty-eight... thirty- eight times.
clifford,"What will happen to him now, without the drugs he was on?"
clifford,"During the time that you had him here, did you discover any particular habits of his, peculiarities, quirks, anything that might help me find him?"
clifford,Any letters from people back in England? Family?
clifford,"Let's get something straight here, Doctor. I've been 33 years in the business of tracking people down and putting them away. I spent almost a year on Curt Duncan alone, with the trial, the testimonies, the background investigations. I didn't come here today to look in your goddamn folders. In fact, I wouldn't have come here at all if you'd done your job right."
clifford, Assuming he isn't found right away... what will happen to him?
retired man,"Rackin' 'em up today, Bill?"
bill, Doin' all right.
hank,C'mon in and shut the door.
hank, Hey! What'll it be?
clifford,Did he have any money with him?
clifford,Duncan had it?
clifford,What is it?
clifford, Are you being serious?
clifford,Duncan was Catholic?
clifford, That makes three of us.
tracy, A little action for your game?
bill," What, him?"
tracy,I wouldn't bet against you.
bill,What's the matter? You don't like me playing with myself?
duncan,Hi.
duncan,What you been up to?
tracy, Thanks for the light. Okay?
duncan,Next round's on me.
tracy," Listen, mister, I've got my own money. So, if you don't mind..."
duncan,"After what I been through, I don't mind anything."
duncan,"See, that's the whole point. My mind... Your mind... Where do they fit in? You know what I mean?"
duncan, Do you live around here?
tracy,Get offa me!!
duncan," Listen, I didn't mean nothin'. I don't live around here. See -- ?"
bill,I think an apology is in order.
bill,That the best you can do?
bill,"I think you'd better just move along, pal."
hank,"He'll be okay now, Bill. He just --"
bill,No! I want him out of here!
bill," Go on, beat it."
bill,"I'm not going to say it again, mister."
bill,Who're you calling?
bill," You're welcome, baby!"
bill, Okay?
old man,"Good riddance to bad rubbish, eh, Bill?"
hank," A fight breaks out, there's gonna be damages. Insurance company doesn't pay without a police report..."
bill,You see any damages?
bill,See ya 'round.
hank," No, it's over now..."
man, What the hell -- !
garber, What is all this?!
scattered voices,"Happy birthday, Charlie!"
woman's voice,Look at him!
man's voice,"Don't shoot us, Charlie!"
garber, How was I supposed to know?
garber,"Will you tell me what this is about, Cliff?"
clifford,"Yeah, in a minute."
garber,I don't think I can take any more of these surprises.
garber,"Okay now, what's the big deal?"
clifford,Stand still. I want you to remember this in the morning.
garber,"If you want me to remember something in the morning, then tell it to me in the morning."
clifford,"Charlie, come on."
clifford,"No. I got a job today, tracking someone."
garber,"That's great, Cliff; I'm sure you'll find your man."
clifford,It's Curt Duncan.
garber,What?
clifford,I need your cooperation on this one.
garber,Sure. Anything.
tracy,"Oh, it's you!  What do you want?"
duncan, ...Came to apologize. I...
tracy,"Look, I'm the one who should be sorry. I didn't want that to happen.  Oh, God! Look at you. Are you all right."
duncan,I'm new in town. Don't know anybody...
tracy, Where're you from?
duncan, New York. Ever been there?
tracy,Sure. Sure I've been there.
duncan,"Kind of a mean place to be. Everyone cold, unfriendly..."
tracy, Excuse me.
tracy," ...No, I just got in... I don't know if I can... Listen, I can't talk now. Can I call you back?... Okay... Goodbye."
duncan,"I'm not from New York, actually. But I'm very, very far from home."
tracy,"Look, you can't come in here."
duncan, I thought we might get some coffee. Can I buy you -- ?
tracy,I don't think so.
duncan,Someplace nearby?
tracy,Not tonight. You'd better go.
duncan,I got no place to go.
tracy, You can't --
duncan,"Just, just a little coffee?"
tracy,Maybe tomorrow.
duncan,"Okay, tomorrow. When?"
tracy,"I said maybe. I don't know.  Listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon. I really am. All right? That was my boyfriend on the phone. He's coming over. So please leave. Now."
duncan,I like you.
tracy," Look, do you want me to call the cops?"
duncan, It's okay. It's okay.
duncan,I'll see you later... sometime. I still want to buy you that drink.
clifford,"Jesus, I don't recognize anybody."
garber,Three years is a long time in a place like this.
clifford,Three and a half.
wc,"Hiya, Cliff. Howya doin'?"
clifford, Hi...
garber,How long will you be here?
clifford,"Depends on how lucky I get.  I'll only be coming around once, maybe twice a week."
garber,You want to use your old desk? Someplace to sit down?
clifford, Is it vacant?
maintenance man,"Okay, man, move it out. Let's go."
cheater,Wha -- ?
old woman,There's another one down there.
maintenance man,Hey!
maintenance man," Come on, bright eyes. Wake up. Wake -- Jesus Christ! What happened to you?"
maintenance man,"I'm sorry, man, but you can't stay in here. Go out to the park, lay in the sunshine. You'll feel better. Okay?"
maintenance man,God bless it! Hey!
maintenance man,Out. Out. Out. Out. Out.
cheater, All right! All right!
cheater,"Whaddya say, pardner. I'm dry as a bone. You got any money?"
cheater,"You neither, huh?  My name is Morgan, but it ain't J.P. Guess I better go to work. Take 'er easy now, pardner."
tracy,Who is it?
tracy,A what?
tracy,What do you want with me?
tracy,I've got nothing to say about anything or anybody.
tracy,Have you got a badge?
clifford,"I don't carry a badge. I'm issued a license, a piece of paper, and I left it at home. You're Tracy Fuller?"
clifford,Can we sit down?
clifford,Do you recognize this man?
tracy,Why?
clifford,"He's escaped from the insane asylum. In 1972, he murdered two children... broke into a house and found them asleep in bed. It was a little boy, five an a half, and a little three- year-old girl. After the coroner's investigation, their bodies were taken to the mortuary, where the undertaker took one look at them and said he couldn't have their bodies reconstructed for the funeral without six days of steady work. Then he asked what had been the murder weapon, because looking at the mess in front of him, he couldn't imagine what had been used. The coroner told him there had been no murder weapon. The killer had used only his hands.  The undertaker went to work and had them done in four."
clifford,What's the matter?
tracy, He's been here.
clifford,Let's play it safe. Let's assume that he will.
hank,You again?
clifford,What are your hours tonight?
hank,No hours. Bar's closed on Mondays.
clifford,I want you to be open if that's possible.
hank, No way. Monday's my night off. Come back tomorr...
clifford, This is tomorrow! Now what are your hours?
garber, Any luck?
clifford,"I've come to say goodbye, and thank you."
garber,You found him?
clifford,I think so.
garber,Where?
clifford,"From here on, I go it alone."
garber,"What's the point of chancing it, Cliff? We'll let you take the credit."
clifford,No.
clifford,"I'm going to kill him, Charlie."
clifford,"The closer I get to this guy, the more I... It gets to me. I don't know..."
garber,"I think you'd better go on home, Cliff. You've fallen in."
clifford,"No. Not this time. This is the case that makes up for a whole career. If you can't understand it now, you will in a few years."
garber,What part does money play in all this? Play straight with me.
clifford," For what I'm being paid, it's not out of line."
garber,Who's hired you for this?
garber, So you're a hitman now.
clifford," He murdered two kids in cold blood. You were there, too."
garber,You could get busted.
clifford,I understand that.
garber,What are you going to use?
clifford,Jimmy needles.
garber,"You're stretching our friendship, Cliff. If you blow this at all --"
clifford,You'll never hear from me again.
garber,Take your time. Do it right.
clifford,Don't worry.
garber,Do you need any help preparing for this thing?
clifford, I'm ready. I'm just trying to think where he could be in the meantime.
waitress,What happened to you?
waitress,You get mugged?
duncan,Black.
waitress,Coffee's twenty-seven.
waitress, Coffee's twenty-seven cents. Ya got it or don't ya?
waitress,"Okay, buster, one cup. On the house."
waitress,Drink it and be on your way.
waitress,You're welcome.
duncan,"No, thank you."
cheater,"Well! I can't say much for your protocol, but your timing's dead on. Here's to you, pardner."
clifford," I'm looking for an old buddy of mine, English fella. Name's Crazy Curt. Any of you guys seen him?"
clifford,I owe him some money.
cheater,Aaahh. Show me an honest man...
clifford, Stands about so. Brown hair. Face kind of banged up. Was in an accident.
cheater,"Oh, yeah? I was just with that guy, not more'n an hour ago. Looked bad. Crazy Curt, huh?"
clifford,Where?
cheater,"Hell, I can't remember. Prob'bly see him again though. Tell you what. You leave the money with me, I'll see he gets it... as a favor to you."
clifford,I have to talk to him.

clifford,Sure. Keep the bottle. I'll be back.

hank, Trying to make a buck.
hank,"Keep it, honey. My treat."

tracy," Oh, God..."
clifford,Are you all right?
tracy,I'm okay.
clifford,I'm going to hang around outside for awhile. I'll be back on and off again all night.

tracy,Sure.
duncan, I want you to be my friend.
duncan,Please...
seaman,So this will be your first time?  An old salt like you?
seaman, You'll love it here. It's where they make the bombs. It's where they make the planes that carry the bombs; the planes we saw over Singapore and Manila.
seaman,There she is. That's America.
cheater,"Hail fellow well met, and all that jazz. It's our lucky day!  A friend of your's got money for you. We got to get back to the park and meet him."
cheater,"C'mon. He'll be comin' for you, Crazy Curt. S'got some money.  We'll get us a little joy juice."
cheater,C'mon! Hey!! You really are crazy! C'mon!
cheater,"""Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage! Blow, you cataracts and hurricanoes, spout till you have drench'd our steeples and drown'd the cocks!"""
clifford,Duncan. Duncan. It's over now. Come on out.
clifford,My name's John Clifford. I'm a private detective. I've been hired by Alexander Mandrakis to take you back. I'm not going to hurt you.
clifford, I'm not going to hurt you... I'm not going to hurt you... There'll be no more pain... You're safe now...
duncan, No! Mandrakis! No!
tracy,Now... it's been years. They're grown up.
tracy,"I look at where I am now. I know I could've done better, but... it's too late for that."
clifford, I know.
tracy,"Well, you've got to keep looking, I suppose."
clifford,I don't think he'll come back here.
clifford, Thanks... for all your help.
clifford,"I know it wasn't easy.  Maybe, someday, I'll be able to..."
tracy,I wish you wouldn't leave me altogether...
tracy," I'm not a young woman anymore. I've given up all my dreams of the future. Now, I just want to make it to the end. You know what I mean."
clifford,I'll be around.

john,"Wait a minute! Just hold on! Sweetheart, what was him? What are you talking about?"
jill,That man... Curt Duncan... He's home again! He's got our children!
john,He was on the phone?
carol,Hello?
john,"Hello, Carol, it's Mr. Lockhart. What's going on over there?"
carol,Nothing's going on.
john,Is everything all right?
carol,"Yes, there's nothing --"
john,Are you sure?
carol,Everything's fine. Why? What's --?
john,"Carol, listen to me very carefully. If there's a man in the house, if there's any reason why you can't talk to me right now, just answer yes to me over the phone. That's all. If there's any danger of any kind, just say yes."
carol,I don't understand what's happening. What man in the house?
jill,"Carol, it's Mrs. Lockhart. Answer me truthfully. When was the last time you looked in on the children?"
carol,About forty-five minutes ago. Everything's fine. They were fast asleep.
john,"Carol, I'm sorry about all the hysterics. We're leaving the restaurant now. We'll explain everything when we get home. Before we hang up, could you do just one more thing for me, please?"
carol,What?
john,"Would you go upstairs and, and check on the children for me?"
carol,Sure. Hold on.
john," Officer, I'm John Lockhart. Just a second please, and I'll explain everything."
jill," I'm Jill Johnson, the babysitter seven years ago with the child killer."
john,The babysitter. The guy got into the house and killed the two children upstairs.
john,That's right. That's the one.
jill, Hello?
jill,Carol?
jill, Carol? Carol?!
john,Carol? Carol?
john,Jill!
june, Mommy?
jill,Sshhh...
jill,What are you thinking about?
john,If I ever get my hands on the guy that made that call...
jill,"John, it wasn't a prank. I know that voice."
john,"He disguised it though, didn't he? Same as before?"
jill,I know that voice.
jill,How can we just sit here?
john,"Look, we promised never to talk about this."
john,"What are we supposed to do? Leave town? Take the kids and lock ourselves up somewhere? Come on... Let's get a good night's sleep, and in the morning we can rethink this whole thing."
jill,Nothing has to be rethought. And I'm not about to fall asleep.
john,"Try to relax, honey. I'm here. We're both here. The house is locked up. The cops'll be just outside all night long. We're safe now."
jill,That's what they told me before.
john,Okay. Look. If it'll make you feel any better...
john,I'll keep it right here beside me all night. You know I'm a light sleeper and a damn good shot. Are you satisfied?
jill,"John, I'm sorry to be putting you through all this."
john,"Hey, you're not putting me through anything that you don't have to go through yourself. I'm with you all the way. Trust me. Okay?"
john,That's my girl.
jill, Honey...
jill,Not so loud. You're going to wake the children.
john," Here, take a couple of these. They're just what the doctor ordered."
garber,"Hey, Tucker, lemme see that a minute."
garber,You guys have a stake on the house?
garber, Thanks.
garber,Cliff?... I think I got something for you...
clifford,Can you dial a local number for me?
clifford,"Operator, what does that mean?"
clifford,Why don't I get a recording?
clifford,"Yeah, okay. Thanks."
jill,Stevie... Stevie...
stevie, Yes?
jill,"Stevie, listen to me. Where did you get this candy?"
stevie,What?
jill,Where did you get this?
stevie, The man gave it to me...
jill,What man?
stevie, I don't know... He was... Wings on a horse...
jill, John?... John?...
jill,John!... John!...
clifford,Your husband's okay.
june,Mommy?
