principal victoria,"Boys, I seriously doubt that Mr. Garrison ever said-  'Eat penguin shit you cum sucking ass spelunker' in school!"
stan,"Oh, oh..."
principal victoria,"Thank you all for coming on such short notice. As you can see, your boys are all being disciplined."

kyle's mother,"What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?"
principal victoria,"No, it was worse than that..."
kyle's mother, The F word?!
principal victoria,"No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying."
stan's mother,Oh dear God...
kyle's mother,What is 'fisting'?
cartman's mother,That's when the fist is inserted into the anus or vagina for sexual pleasure.
cartman's mother,What?
kyle's mother," Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!"
kyle,"I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!"
cartman,It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
stan,Dude!
cartman,"What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here."
kyle's mother,Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
principal victoria,What is Terrance and Phillip?
kyle's mother,"Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!"
principal victoria,"Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'."
cartman,Everybody's already fucking seen it.
cartman,I'm sorry! I can't help it!! That movie has warped my fragile little mind.
kyle's mother,"Alright, boys, that's enough. Get out and let us adults speak."
kyle's mother,We must take action on this immediately.
principal victoria,Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
kyle's mother,"Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft?  As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code."
principal victoria,Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
kyle's mother,Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
principal victoria,But I-
kyle's mother,You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
kyle's mother,Get out of that chair! The PTA is in charge now!
kyle's mother,Attention students. We are now enforcing a new dress code at South Park Elementary. Terrance and Phillip shirts are NO LONGER ALLOWED IN SCHOOL. Anyone wearing a Terrance and Phillip shirt is to be SENT HOME IMMEDIATELY.
kids,HOOORAY!!!
wendy,Hello?
news anchor,"All over America, kids are flocking to the R rated film, 'Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire'. Here with a special report, is a quadriplegic midget in a bikini."
teacher,"Alright, this is for the silver medal. Spell 'Forensics'."
kid,"Oh, fuck that, why should I fucking have to spell forensics?"
kid,"Here you go; S-U-C-K-M-Y-A-S-S, FORENSICS."
clown,"Hey kids, how would you like to see some magic tricks?!"
kids,FUCK YOU!!
clown,Huh?
child,"Yeah, and fuck your stupid little red nose."
child 2,"Yeah, and fuck your yellow hair. And fuck your gay pants."
news anchor,"Thanks, midget. Shocking report.  The controversy surrounding the Terrance and Phillip movie began in the small mountain town of South Park, Colorado where the local PTA banned the movie.  With us tonight is the head of the South Park PTA, Sheila Brofloski-"
news anchor,"Ms. Brovlofski, how are these kids seeing this film? Is bad parenting to blame? Or is it Canada?"
kyle's mother,Canada!
news anchor,Alright. Here with a counterpoint is the Canadian Minister of Movies.
news anchor,"Thank you, Minister, for joining us."
news anchor,"Minister, parents all over America are concerned about your country's entertainment. Your thoughts?"
kyle's mother,Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!
kyle's mother,YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
kyle's mother,BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
news anchor,"But minister, it isn't like this film is the first troublesome thing to come out of Canada. Let us not forget Brian Adams a few decades ago."
kyle's mother,"The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!"
terrance,"Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience."
phillip,"I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!"
terrance,"Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?"
phillip,"You bet, Terrance!"
phillip,HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
terrance," I sure did, Phillip!!"

cartman,"Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that."
kenny,Mph rmpmh rm.
cartman,No way.
stan,"Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?"
wendy,Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
stan,WHAT?!
cartman,Oh shit.
wendy,It's just... It's obvious that we don't have a whole lot in common anymore. I need somebody who's... a little deeper.
stan,"But Wendy, I can go-"
wendy,"No. Don't speak. You'll only make things more annoying. Goodbye, Stan."
kyle,"Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways."
stan, Yeah...

cartman,"No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!"
kyle,Oh.

canadian ambassador,"As The Canadian Ambassador, I hereby condemn the actions taken by America in apprehending Terrance and Phillip!"
canadian ambassador,"We demand their release IMMEDIATELY!! As you can see from this graph, the entire economy of Canada relies on Terrance and Phillip! Without them we are doomed to recession!"

kyle's mother,"As president and founder of M.A.C., I would like to state-"
kyle's mother,"Yes, Mothers Against Canada."

cartman,"About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This whole thing has gone too far!"
kyle,"I don't really think you need Cheesy- Poofs, tubby-"
kyle's mother,"Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion."
kyle,We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
stan,"Yeah, how come you arrested Terrance and Phillip?"
stan's mother,"Stanly, you're too young to understand what's good for you. That's why we mothers have taken charge."
kyle,But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
cartman,Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?
kyle's mother,"What was that word, young man!?"
cartman's mother,"Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-"
kyle's mother,I know what it is!
cartman, Lick someone's ass?!
kyle's mother,The Terrance and Phillip movie has obviously done irreparable damage to their brains.  We have to put them in rehab right away.
kyle,What's that?
kyle's mother,You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
stan's mother,There are?
kyle's mother,"Well no, I guess not...  But we will establish the first of its kind right here in South Park.  All the children in town will have to attend and receive treatment from the school counselor Mr. Mackey!  Ooh I just love when I get these sorts of ideas!"
cartman,Why?  So you can fuck up our life some more?
cartman's mother,Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
cartman,But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!

satan,"You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!"
kenny,MMMPPH!!!
kyle,"But they're just words, Mr. Mackey. Our parents are over-reacting."
bebe,"Yeah, Wendy's here, and she doesn't even like Terrance and Phillip!"
cartman,"Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal..."
gregory,My name is Gregory... And I have a potty mouth.
cartman,You've got a stupid accent too.
cartman,What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
gregory,How are you gonna do that?
kids," You can do it, it's all up to you mkay? With a method, there's nothing you can't do, mkay? We don't have to spend our lives addicted to crack Homeless on the streets giving hand- jobs for cash"
kids,"Step one: Think about fun. Think about all that you'll miss addicted to this Step two: Think it all through. Think how's this gonna change my life, what am I gonna miss? Step three: Go and hug a tree, Hug anything that gets in your way! And step four: Just don't do it anymore - it's easy, Mkay!"
kyle's mother,What the hell do they think this is?! Summer camp?!
kyle's mother,"Mr. Mackey, what is going on?!"
kyle's mother,This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
cartman,"God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle."
news reporter,"Tom I'm standing in front of the U.S. Supreme Court where the most important trial of the - day - is happening. Thousands of people have shown up from all over the country to show their outrage and disgust at Canada. Joining me now is Mrs. McKormick, mother of the poor little boy who was killed by the Canadians."
news reporter,"Mrs. McKormick, you must really hate the Canadians."
kenny's mother,"Yes, yes I do, Tom."
news reporter,Did you ever think you would see the day when thousands of people were wearing your son Kenny on T-shirts?
kenny's mother,No I didn't. But if any of you would like one they're 14.95. Available in blue or white.
news reporter,"Well, we can only imagine the intense, vehement trial that is going on inside."
johnny cochran,"Terrance and Phillip... You knowingly, with malice of forethought were trying to destroy American culture, yes or no?"
johnny cochran,YES OR NO!
stan,Shh! Mr. Mackey's gonna hear us!
terrance,The Americans are just showing their TRUE COLORS as smelly bastards.
phillip,Fight the power!
terrance,"The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?"
phillip,Don't believe the hype!!
kids, Yeah! WooHoo!
terrance,You cannot oppress us! We will continue to pursue our art. We know there are Americans out there who will help us!
kyle's mother,Your 'ART' is shallow and immature! We Americans do NOT allow that for our children!!
phillip,Please. You teach your children that America is the land of the free. But it's all bullshit. You're one of the most conservative countries in the world!
terrance,"The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it."
phillip,"Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up."
kyle's mother,THAT IS ENOUGH!!
terrance,WAKE UP AMERICA! YOUR government censors YOU from the world.
kyle's mother,NO THEY DON'T!
phillip,"YES THEY DO! AND I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU! IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR, THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT-"

dubbed phillip,Oh? Is that so?
terrance,"Oh, you are such a maroon!"
phillip,"You would know, dummy."
terrance,You are pigeon-like in your intelligence.
cartman,WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
kyle,"Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!"
cartman,"Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie."
cartman,"You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!"
cartman,Help yourself prickfuck!
cartman,"Ha, ha, you stupid asshole prickfuck."
kyle's mother,How is the children's progress?
kyle's mother,"What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?"
kyle's mother,Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.
kyle's mother," I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation."
judge,"Madam foreman, have you reached a verdict?"
foreman,"We have, your honor."
judge,"How find you, the jury?"

cartman,That'd be sweet! We could try to bring back Cheesy Poofs!
kyle,"Yeah, let's make Free Terrance and Phillip buttons!"
wendy,You guys don't even care. All you care about is seeing Terrance and Phillip fart on each other more.
stan,Yeah!
wendy,"This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship."
gregory,"Yes, what's next? Barcodes on our forearms? This country is the most fascist of all."
stan,"What the hell are you talking about, kid?"

satan,Prepare thyself for unending pain! Unparalleled misery!!
saddam hussein,"Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again."
kenny,Mrph mprph!!
saddam hussein,"What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children."
kenny,Mrph mprhm mm rmph!

kenny,Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!
saddam hussein,"Oh, you want out of hell, huh?"
satan,Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
saddam hussein,"Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT."
kenny,Mrph?
saddam hussein,I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
saddam hussein, Well what are you waiting for pal?!  Get to it!
saddam hussein,HA HA HAHA!! What a dumbass!!
satan,I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
saddam hussein,"Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?"
satan,Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
saddam hussein,"Hey, come here, guy."
saddam hussein,Who's my cream puff?
satan,I am.
mother,"Is that a new pearl bracelet, Mrs. McKormick?"
kenny's mother,Why yes. Yes it is.
kyle's mother,"As our next official order of business here at M.A.C., we will test the new V- chip. As most of you know, the V-chip was created to lock children out of watching certain shows on television. And now the N.I.H. has created a new, exciting product that they can tell us all about. Here is the Surgeon General, Dr. Pangloss."
doctor pangloss,"Thank you, parents."
doctor pangloss,"The machinery of the new 'V-chip' is very simple, and similar to that of the V- chip. The chip is placed just under the subject's skin, where it emits a small but painful shock of electricity whenever an obscenity is uttered."
stan's father,"Now wait a minute, are you telling us that this chip somehow KNOWS if the kid is swearing?"
doctor pangloss,"It's just like a lie detector. Certain things happen in you when you swear just like when you lie, the chip picks up on this and gives the subject a shock."
doctor pangloss,"We are very excited to see the results of this test.  Patient 453, would you step out here, please?"
doctor pangloss,Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
cartman,My head hurts.
doctor pangloss,"Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'"
cartman,Doggy.
doctor pangloss,Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
cartman,Montana.
doctor pangloss,Good. Now 'Pillow'.
cartman,Pillow.
doctor pangloss,"Alright, now I want you to say 'horsefucker.'"
cartman's mother,"Go ahead, it's alright, Eric."
cartman,Horsefuck-
cartman,AGAAHGAHGAH!!!!!
cartman,OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
cartman,OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
doctor pangloss,Success!! Our device works perfectly! We will begin mass production immediately!
kyle's mother,And so we have succesfully removed the Canadian smut from all of our children's brains. We have made changes at school to ensure that our kids are NEVER AGAIN exposed to smut!!!!!!! It's OVER!
stan,Hi Wendy.
wendy, Hi Stan.
kyle,"Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you."
stan, I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!

kyle,What's that for?
soldier 2,You get a star for doing well in school.
wendy,NAZIS!!
stan,"What's the matter, Wendy?"
wendy,"Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand."
stan," God damn it, why does she keep saying that?"
stan,I'm so sick of these soldiers.
kyle,"Yeah, they suck."
cartman,"I know.  Always saying, do this, do that. They think they're so cooool.  OW!!!"
chef,"Hello there, children!!"
stan,"Hey, Chef."
chef,How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles?
kyle,"We can't, we're on a hunger strike."
chef,A hunger strike? For what?
stan,To free Terrance and Phillip.
cartman,But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
stan,"Chef, do you know anything about women?"
chef,Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
kyle,I don't know.
chef,"Children, I know ALL there is to know about women."
stan,What's the secret to making a woman happy?
chef," Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris."
stan,Huh?
chef,"Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?"
stan,"No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?"
cartman,Is that like finding Jesus or something?
chef,"Uh... Nothing. Forget I said anything. Now move along, children! You're holding up the line!"
stan,"Woa, I wonder what's going on, dude."
principal victoria,"Please take your seats, everyone!!!!"
kyle,"What's going on, Chef?"
chef,"Something big, children."
news anchor, This is a State of Emergency. We go now to the White House for a VERY IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT from the President of the United States.
president clinton,"Ladies and gentlemen... At five a.m. today, a day which will live in infamy... sort of... the U.S. has declared war on Canada."
chef,"Oh, no..."
cartman,Holy crap-  AGAGAGH!!!
president clinton,"All Canadians are to leave the country immediately, or be subject to military camps. All Canadian products are to be thrown out."
principal victoria,How can they do this?
president clinton,"Do not be afraid of this war. Instead embrace it. We have God on our side. And besides, they're just Canadians, what the hell are they gonna do?"
stan,"Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?"
chef,It's... It's not good children.
principal victoria,What do we do? Do we go on as normal or...?
president,"And now, I would like to bring up the woman who led, and is still leading the way in this glorious stand-"
kyle, HOLY SHIT DUDE!!
president,Mrs. Sheila Brovlofski.
chef,"Isn't that your mother, Kyle?"
kyle's mother,My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
president,"As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack."
kyle's mother,What about air strikes?
president,Huh?
kyle's mother,We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
president,"Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary."
kyle's mother,"Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!"
chef,"Damn, your mom's a bitch, Kyle."
cartman,Amen to that.
kenny,Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
george burns,"Snacky Smores? Why the hell would I have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores? Beat it, kid."
saddam hussein,"You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself."
satan,I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
tv,"In war news, countries from Europe and Asia are joining sides in the Canadian- American War-"
saddam hussein,"-Listen butterbuns, let's make love and forget about the whole thing-"
satan,SHHH!!!!
tv,...The death count is already on its way to 10 million with no signs of slowing down.  What started as a spat between the United States and Canada is quickly turning into World War III-
satan,It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
saddam hussein,Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
satan,No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign.
satan,"Behold, the signs of my reign on earth are all falling into place!  The fall of an empire-"
satan,-The coming of a comet-

saddam hussein,"Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing."
satan,Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
saddam hussein,I love you.
saddam hussein,You know I do.
satan,I know.
saddam hussein,"So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh?"
saddam hussein,"Yeah, you like that, don't you bitch?"
kyle,Does it say what the clitoris is?
stan,All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
kyle,Isn't that in Arizona or something?
stan,What is this?
cartman,They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.

kyle,I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!
stan,I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!
cartman,And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!
stan,But what are we going to do against this entire army?
kyle,We've gotta get the word out. We'll get on my dad's computer and use the internet! Come on you guys!
boys,Something must be done! Something's gotta give! This world has become a bitch in which we have no desire to live!
boys,We've pushed it to the edge And now the time has come! Something's gotta change! Something must be done! Something must be done!!!
kyle,Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...

kyle,Damn it! They've got an access code! I'll try to reroute the encryptions...
stan,"Dude, do you know what you're doing?"
kyle,"No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works."
kyle,"Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night..."
cartman,Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.

cartman,More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
kyle, pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
stan, La Resistance.
kyle,"You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?"
ike,Uhh...
kyle,"Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed."
president,How can you tell?
pentagon guy,"Sir, we're tracking a signal crossing into Canadian computers! It looks like we may have a resistance movement starting..."
president," Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!"
kyle's mother,Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
president,Yes ma'am!
kyle's mother,And Bill?
president,Yes?
kyle's mother,I'm needing lunch.
president,"Right away, ma'am!"
cartman's mother,"Goodnight, honey."
cartman,Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
cartman's mother,"I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?"
cartman,"Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off."
cartman's mother,Oh.
cartman,Mom...
cartman's mother,"Yes, hon?"
cartman,"If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?"
cartman's mother,"Sure, hon. Goodnight."

saddam hussein,"That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!"
satan,Don't call me dumb!
saddam hussein,I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
satan,How come you always want to make love to me from behind? Is it because you want to pretend I'm somebody else?
saddam hussein,"Satan, your ass is gigantic and red, who am I gonna pretend you are? Helen Reddy?"
saddam hussein,"Come on, kid. Help me with these shower curtains."
satan," Sometimes I think When I look up real high That there's a whole world up there And just maybe it could be mine But then, I sink because it's here I'm supposed to stay but I don't even know how or why its supposed to be that way-"
satan,"Up there, there is so much room Where babies burp and flowers bloom Everyone dreams I can dream too Up there, Up where The skies are ocean blue I could be safe and live without a care... Up there"
satan,"They say I don't belong That my place is down below Because of my beliefs I'm supposed to stay where evil is sewn But what is evil anyway? Is there reason to the rhyme? Without evil there could be no good So it must be good to be evil sometimes Up there, there is so much room Where babies burp and flowers bloom. Everyone dreams I can dream too Up there, Up where The skies are ocean blue I could be safe and life without a care... Up there"
kyle,"You're late, Cartman!"
cartman,I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.

general plymkin,PAY ATTENTION!
general plymkin,"It's no secret that the Evil Canadian Federation has scored major victories all over the United State.  We have brought you here because you ar America's best, and last hope."
general plymkin,"Oh... Apparently you're not the best, you're simply the last. Anyway, let's strategize... Map!"
general plymkin,Our sources have told us that the Canadians might try to attach tomorrow's USO show and stop us from executing Terrance and Phillip.
general plymkin,"Now each battalion has a specific code- name and mission.  Battalion 5, raise your hands-"
general plymkin,"You will be the all-important first defense wave, which we will call 'Operation Human Shield'."
chef,"Hey, wait a minute..."
general plymkin,"Now keep in mind, 'Operation Human Shield' will suffer heavy losses.  But don't lose your spirit men!  Stay until the bitter end.  Battalion 14?"
general plymkin,"Right, you are 'Operation Get Behind The Darkies'.  You will follow Battalion 5 here-"
general plymkin,-and try not to get killed for God's Sake.  Are there any questions men?
general plymkin,Yes soldier?
chef,Have you ever heard of the Emancipation Proclamation?
general plymkin,I don't listen to hip-hop.
general plymkin,"If you somehow live, we will regroup on this hill outside--"
general plymkin,Now what's wrong with this thing?
general plymkin,Fucking windows 98!

general plymkin,YOU TOLD US WINDOWS 98 WOULD BE FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENT WITH BETTER ACCESS TO THE INTERNET!!!
bill gates,"It is faster, over five million--"
general plymkin,"Alright men, get lots of rest, and prepare thyselves for battle!"
gregory,"...after you clear this zone here, rendezvous behind this ridge where Terrance and Phillip should be held."
kyle,Gotcha.
gregory,"You are indeed brave, but you will need someone who's done this sort of thing before.  MOLE!"
voice,Oui?
gregory,"Thank you for coming, Mole."
the mole,So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
kyle,"Yeah, I guess."
the mole,America... She iz a beetch that sheets on her own children.
gregory,This is the Mole.  He will accompany you to the prison where Terrance and Phillip are.  He is an expert in covert operations and a lifelong fighter for freedom.
the mole,Freedom... It's like cow's urine poured down your troat. You wonder 'Do I want this?' I'm thersty... But it's urine.
gregory,"Good luck Stan, I'll make sure Wendy is... kept safe?"
kyle,Give me Terrance and Phillip or give me death!!!
others,YEA!!!
gregory,God has smiled upon you this day The fate of a nation in your hands...
gregory,As brothers and sisters we unite And behind you we shall fight! Until only the most righteous belief stands!
gregory,"Do you see the distant flames? they bellow in the night Fight in all our names For what we know is right And if you all get shot and cannot carry on Though you die, La Resistance lives on!"
kyle,What? Shot?
kids,You might get stabbed in the head by a dagger or a sword You might be burned to death or skinned alive or worse!
gregory,"But when they torture you You will not feel a need to run For though you die, La Resistance Lives on!"
kids,Do you hear the beating drum? It is our hearts all joined to one It is the music of our souls knowing we have much to overcome!
kyle's mother,Something must be done! Tomorrow it will be! We're going to execute this threat to our democracy!
satan,I want to be part of that world! But if only I had the strength to go without HIM... If only I had the strength to leave him behind... Get on with my life in that world... Start over as part of that world...
soldiers,Tomorrow we face our destiny! Tomorrow we fight to keep our country free! Death to Canada! Death to them all! Like our forefathers we shall answer the call!
chef, Baby your thighs sparkle like diamonds Baby your butt is tender like the night I can see by the look in your pants that you want to treat me right. I'll whisper sweet nothings in your cleavage And you can kiss me gently with your tongue And I'll make love to you so deeply That you'll feel pressure clear up to your lungs.
soldiers,Something must be done! Something's gotta give! Tomorrow we will be free or we will no longer live!
kids,Let it echo through the night! Let it reach the ears of everyone! Though we die La Resistance lives on! Though we die La Resistance lives onnnn!!!!! Ah- AHHHH!!!
