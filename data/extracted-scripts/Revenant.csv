Speaker,Dialogue
fitzgerald,Likely got a splinter. Can't figure what to do without Mama here to pull it out for him.
boone,"Need a doc, Captain?"
henry,Gather more wood.
fitzgerald, Shame my Pap was a broken down drunk. Else he could've bought me a Captain's job too.
henry,"Glass and the others will be back with some game, Fitzgerald. Just make sure you have the fires ready."
fitzgerald,"My supper's in the hands of a hermit nigger, a kid and a dummy. Hell, my belly feels full already."
bridger,But bigger than we figured. Gonna be a load to haul back to camp.
pig,Have to split it up I reckon.
glass,"Yep. Bridger'll take the tail, and Pig you haul the rest."
bridger,Another one close by?
pig,Hugh?
boone,No rule says I'm the only one that's gotta gather this shit.
trapper,`REE!
glass,GET TO THE BOAT!
trapper,WAIT!
bridger,Thank you.
fitzgerald,"What's the plan, Captain?"
anderson,We're just floatin' farther from Fort Union.
glass,The Missouri's no good. Not if the `Ree's running it.
fitzgerald,So we just float the hell down to Mexico or wherever else this river takes us?
glass,"We get ourselves safe outta range, then track another course up."
fitzgerald,Add weeks to the trip.
bridger,Better that than endin' up scalped on the side of the river.
fitzgerald," Shut up, kid, you don't get no say in this."
henry,"I understand our situation, Mr. Fitzgerald. We do like Glass said... put some distance between us and the Arikara, then chart a course to Fort Union."
pig,Reckon it's better `an lettin' the `Ree find him... take his ears... slice what's left all to shit.
henry,"So we hike west to the Grand, then follow it up to Fort Union."
fitzgerald,On foot? You got any idea how long that's gonna take? It'll be winter before we get there.
anderson,Unless we come across a post... trade for some horses.
glass,No posts that far out.
fitzgerald,"So if we do this, we do every step with our own feet."
henry,"We make camp here for the night, then load supplies and head out for the Grand at first light.  And gather extra blankets `cause there won't be any fires."
bridger,Thank you... for what you done back there.
glass,You'd have done the same for me.
fitzgerald,"You treat that Anstadt sweeter than any woman, Glass."
stubby bill,Never seen a woman that could stop a `Ree from three hundred feet.
anderson,I knew a particular big-breasted redhead in Boston that might come close.
fitzgerald,Bring it over here for me to have a look.
bridger, You seen it before.
fitzgerald,"What'd you say, kid?"
bridger, I said you shoulda already got a look when he saved you with it earlier.
fitzgerald,You're lucky you ain't a man yet.  Else that mighta nicked somethin'.
glass,Middle of workin' on it.
fitzgerald,"Well you can stop workin' on it, and let me have a look like I said."
glass,"Best I can tell, my place is right where I want it... on the smart end of my rifle."
fitzgerald,"I'd be careful if I was you, boy."
henry,"That's enough, Fitzgerald. Go sober up and get to sleep.  If you're passed out when we break camp tomorrow, I leave you here."
fitzgerald,That's the trouble with this part of the world. No mirrors. Niggers forget what color they are.
henry,Can't sleep either?
glass,Never like closin' my eyes when I'm not sure who'll be standin' over me when I open `em.
henry,I keep thinking about Boone and the others... how maybe I should've had us make camp further up river.
glass,"The tracks I saw... those `Ree had been tailin' us for a while. They'd have gone as far north as it took.  You're a good man, Captain. Soon as you realize that, these others will too."
henry,Your years trappin' and guidin' out here... have you had much experience with the Arikara?
glass,Enough to try and stay outta their way.
henry, But you know this country well enough to get us past them... up to Fort Union?
glass,I been here a long while. Whether that gets us to Union or not...
henry,What Fitzgerald said earlier... he doesn't speak for the rest.
glass,He wasn't wrong. Truth is that's what I prefer about this country... it's got no eye for the color of a man's skin.
henry," Try to get some sleep, Hugh."
stubby bill,Shouldn't we have hit the Grand by now?
henry,We'll reach it soon enough. Glass said to keep this course.
fitzgerald,Glass said. Too bad I don't see him.
pig,"That's on account he's up ahead makin' sure it's clear, and you get to keep your ears."
fitzgerald,Or he's run off and left us.
bridger,He wouldn't do that.
fitzgerald,"My bet, that nigger's used to runnin'."
henry,UP AHEAD!
bridger,Christ Almighty.
henry,Glass!
pig,HUGH!
bridger,He's down here!
murphy,"Oh, Jesus."
stubby bill,He's tore to pieces.
anderson,Least he took that Grizz down with him.
fitzgerald,"Wished he'da done it without firing his rifle. If there wasn't no `Ree around before, there will be now."
henry,THAT'S ENOUGH!
bridger,"Holy Christ, he's alive."
henry,Get me some water.
bridger,"Oh, Jesus... Jesus."
henry,"It's okay, Hugh.  You're going to be fine."
pig,"What about me, Cap?"
henry,Get down here and help me tie off these wounds best we can.
pig,It won't stop bleedin'.
henry,"Shut up, Pig.  We're fixing you up, Hugh."
bridger,"It's gonna be fine, Mr. Glass."
henry,Roll him over... easy.
bridger,What about the rest of him?
henry,He's losing more blood back here.  And I don't know what to do with that yet.
anderson,They're torturin' the poor bastard.
fitzgerald,And riskin' gettin' us killed in the process. Proper thing would be to end it for him quick.
anderson,`Less he could pull through.
fitzgerald,"You seen what that grizz did to him. Shit, Glass'll be dead inside a hour. We all will be if he keeps screamin' like that."
bridger,What now?
henry,We wait. Does he have any kin you know of?
pig,He keeps to hisself. Never mentioned none.
henry,Go get the others. Tell `em we're making camp here for the night.
bridger,It ain't for me.
pig,"I can feel some air outta his mouth. Maybe Captain sealed up his throat proper, huh?  Whatta you figure his odds are, Jim?"
bridger,Long.
murphy,What that bear did to him... I didn't expect he'd last this long.
anderson,I seen a fella go a week once after a lion jumped him. Fever finally finished him off.
stubby bill,"Whatta we do, Cap?"
henry,We give him his chance.
fitzgerald,"You ain't doin' him or us no favors, Captain, lettin' him suffer that way."
anderson,Fever's hit. Won't be long now.
fitzgerald,I seen a bad one drag on days.
fitzgerald," We keep sittin' here watchin' him die, only gives the `Ree more chance to find us."
bridger,"He's burnin', Cap. Water turns to boil as soon as it touches him."
henry,"Pig, take Anderson and scout ahead. Grand should be just west of here. Find us the best route."
fitzgerald,"Tryin' to buy Glass time don't make sense for the rest of us, Captain."
henry, Get movin'.
fitzgerald,Least it's a step in the right direction.
fitzgerald,Any coyote digs that deep deserves the meal.
pig,"Found it, Cap. Right where Glass had us headed."
anderson,No more than a mile or so out.
henry,We could build a litter. Haul him with us.
anderson,It's rocky and steep goin'.
pig,"Marshy and thick on the other side. We could try it, but..."
fitzgerald,"I signed on as a trapper, not a goddamn mule."
bridger, Shape he's in... I don't see no way he'd make bein' drug.
henry,"Lay that rag over his eyes, Mr. Bridger."
bridger,"But, Captain."
henry,Do it.
bridger,I'll stay with him... money or not.
pig,Same here.
henry,"I can't let you stay back, Pig. Without Glass, I'll need you to scout."
fitzgerald,"Two won't stand much chance against a party of `Ree, Captain, and seventy dollars won't buy me a new setta ears."
henry,A hundred then.
bridger,They can have my share too. I owe Glass that at least.
fitzgerald,That case I'll hang back with the kid. I don't mind fallin' a day or so behind for two hundred.
henry,But Glass is to be cared for until. Understood?
fitzgerald, I'll let the young doctor do his job.
henry,The rest gather your gear.
pig,"I'll see ya at Fort Union, Hugh."
henry, As long as necessary.
bridger,I'll look after him.
fitzgerald,I'll take first watch.
bridger,Not with his rifle.
fitzgerald,"Trust me, kid, he ain't gonna be needin' it tonight."
fitzgerald,You were right to protect this.
fitzgerald," When are you gonna die, boy?"
fitzgerald,"Don't you ever question me, you little piss-ant."
bridger,What?
fitzgerald,"Keep quiet. I was down at the creek... there's twenty of `em at least, comin' this way."
bridger,"Oh, shit. Whatta we do?"
fitzgerald,We run. Now.
bridger,What about Glass?
fitzgerald,"He's on his own, same as us."
bridger,I can't leave him.
fitzgerald,Then I'm talkin' to a dead man.
bridger,What're you doin'? He needs that.
fitzgerald,He couldn't hold it if you tarred it to his hands.
bridger,It's his goddamn rifle! That's all he's got!
fitzgerald,And more than he'll need.
bridger,We can't leave him with nothin'.
fitzgerald,We ran the better part of six hours. Had to gain some ground on Henry and them others.
bridger,Best douse that smoke before them `Ree spot it.
fitzgerald,We put enough distance between us and them. And it's too damn cold to go without one.
bridger,"All we know, they hoofed it through the night same as us."
fitzgerald, A dozen `Ree can't make the time us two did.
bridger,It was twenty earlier.
fitzgerald,What?
bridger,When you woke me... you said you'd spotted twenty `Ree.
fitzgerald,"A dozen... twenty. I wasn't in a mood to count feathers. Hell, one `Ree woulda been too many."
bridger,What was you even doin' down at the creak in the middle of the night?  I'd already brought plenty a water.
fitzgerald,Don't start questionin' me on accounta you feelin' guilty `bout leavin' your nigger buddy behind.
bridger,ANSWER ME OR I BLOW YOUR DAMN HEAD OFF!
fitzgerald,"What're you askin'? Why it was you turned your back on Glass? Why you let him die to save your own sorry skin?  `Cause you was scared shitless, that's why."
bridger,The `Ree... did you see `em?  DID YOU SEE `EM?
fitzgerald, Not a one.
bridger,I'm goin' back for him.
fitzgerald,"Far as we ran all night, you couldn't find Glass with dogs and a map. And I don't believe you really want to. `Cause after leavin' him to die the first time, I doubt he'd be too happy to see you now."
spotted horse,Griz-lee.
fitzgerald,`Bout goddamn time.
fitzgerald,Twice the folks here than when we left.
bridger,We should go see Captain Henry.
fitzgerald,Far as we hiked... we got time for a drink on the company's tab.
fitzgerald,"If your fat ass could get through, we didn't have no worries."
pig, Had to be a helluva long walk for you.
bridger,I hope not.
fitzgerald," Maybe we best go see Henry, kid. I just got a itch to spend the first of my two-hundred."
fitzgerald,"I won't pretend to been his friend, but I respect any man that fights the way he done."
henry,And the grave?
fitzgerald,We had those extra days so we went deeper... covered it in rocks. To keep the scavengers off him.
henry,Any sign of hostiles?
fitzgerald,Not a one.
henry,"Glad to hear you pulled your weight, Mr. Bridger. I knew you would."
fitzgerald,"More than his share, Captain."
henry,Speaking of shares.
fitzgerald,"Fortunate for me, it did not."
henry,Well thank you both for your courage and honor. You have done yourselves proud.
fitzgerald,He's beat hisself up most of the trip... wishin' he'da done more.
henry,We all saw the shape Glass was in. There was no more to be done.
fitzgerald,That's what I been tellin' him.
glass, Thank you.
glass,How many suns? Ten?
boys,Tatanka Wicasa.
glass,You speak English.
spotted horse,Need words when trade with whites.
glass,Well I'm grateful for you bringing me here... havin' them care for me.  Now if you could point me which way it is you do your tradin'... with the whites.
spotted horse, Whites. Bra-zo.
glass,Fort Brazeau? That's where I'm tryin' to get. Is it far from here?
spotted horse,Not walk. Hides soon.
glass,The men stole my rifle.
spotted horse,Red Hawk ask who kill griz-lee.
glass,Grizzly?
red hawk,Arikara.
spotted horse,He say Arikara take right ear of Sioux. Left ear of whites. Not know what they take from you.
spotted horse,Buff-A-lo Man hunt with Sioux?
three feathers,Tatanka Wicasa.
boys,Tatanka Wicasa! Tatanka Wicasa!
glass,Thank you.
spotted horse,Good hunt.
glass,Yes.
spotted horse,You. Fam-i-lee?
glass, No.
spotted horse,No wom-an?  Wakayaja?
glass,No. Not for a long time.
glass, Tatanka Wicasa.
glass,Nice.
spotted horse, Nice.
fitzgerald,No... please.
spotted horse,We go.
brazeau, We make good trades then.
glass,"Good to see you again, Mr. Brazeau."
brazeau,"Jesus Christ, what happened to your goddamned face?"
glass,Had a tussle with a grizzly.
brazeau,"And now the grizzly, he don't look so good either, eh?"
glass,They looked after me for a spell. I'm on my way to catch back up with Captain Henry... at Fort Union. Needed to trade for some supplies on the Company's credit if I could.
brazeau,"Oui, of course. Anything you like."
glass,We can start with this.
brazeau,"You can pick up the horse at the livery in the morning.  I wish I could give you a room for the night, but..."
glass,Won't be the last night I sleep on the ground.
brazeau,"Take care of that face, Glass."
glass, You stay here tonight?
spotted horse,Your people?
glass,No.
spotted horse,You come then.
glass,Fort Union.
spotted horse,You spend your life hunting enemy. Enemy wins.
glass,It will be over soon.
fitzgerald,I had enough of this cold as hell shit.
anderson,What'd you figure when ya signed on outta that St. Louis whorehouse you was workin'? That you was headin' off to paradise?
fitzgerald,"I tell ya what I figured, I figured I'd be somewhere the piss wouldn't freeze before I got it outta my pecker."
bridger,Figured wrong.
fitzgerald,Waste a time to check traps in this weather... while Henry sits warmin' his ass on the stove in his office.
stubby bill,"Why don't you go tell him that, Fitz? Then start your hike back to St. Louie."
fitzgerald,"Shit, I walked up here, I got no problem walkin' back."
murphy,Contracted for twelve months. We all did.
fitzgerald,"Henry can shove that contract up his toasty warm ass, or I'll do it for him."
anderson,Just give that fat little whore you're so sweet on a couple extra bits... she'll have you thinkin' it's Spring already.
fitzgerald,Hello? Captain?
fitzgerald,"To the river, Murphy."
murphy,"That you, Fitzgerald?"
fitzgerald,Left my rifle down there... don't want it out all night.
murphy,That weren't too smart.
fitzgerald,Just don't take a shot at me when I come back in.
murphy,We'll see.
fitzgerald,Not that you'd hit me if you tried.
glass, I'm Hugh Glass of...
runty man,We don't serve niggers.
glass,Of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company on my way to Fort Union.
runty man,I don't care if you was with Lewis and Clark headed for the new world. We don't serve niggers.
glass,All I need is a horse and enough supplies to...
trapper,"Ice musta froze up his ears, `cause he ain't listenin' to you, Cees."
glass,...to get me to Fort Union. I can sign a draft made good by Captain Henry.
runty man,"What the fuck happened to your face, boy? You try to slice all the black off?"
fat trapper,"Best get on your way, boy."
glass,"I'm Hugh Glass of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, and all I need is..."
runty man, Do you believe this shit?
fat trapper,"Hell, I warned ya."
glass,All I need...
runty man,"Shoot him, goddammit!"
runty man,Shoot `em both!
runty man,Get after the son of a bitch!
fat trapper,And he did say to put it all on the Rocky Mountain tab.
stubby bill,Jesus Christ.
bridger,I'm sorry.
glass,You took everything I had... left me to die.
bridger,"I was scared of dyin'.  But every day since, I've wished I had."
glass,"There wasn't no `Ree that night, was there?"
bridger,No.
henry,Hugh. Wait.
glass,Where's Fitzgerald and my rifle?
henry,Deserted two days ago. Along with about five hundred dollars of company money.  I wanna hear what happened.
bridger,Wait. Please!
glass,"I cut the shoes loose of her, and hiked over to Fort Talbot."
stubby bill,Christ almighty.
glass,And you may hear from the fella there about a stoled horse and supplies charged to you.
henry,We'll take care of it. You should go settle in.
murphy,"There's a couple fair whores next door that'll ease the miles on ya, scars or not."
anderson,"Jesus, Murph."
murphy,I just meant I'd go roust one of `em for ya if you wanted.
glass,"She can take the night off, but I wouldn't mind the use of her bed."
henry, Go clear out a room. The rest head on back to bunk.
pig,"I told ya I'd see ya up here. You remember that, Hugh?"
glass,"I do, Pig. You must have a little gypsy in ya."
pig,I'll see ya in the mornin'.
henry,Can I talk you outta what you're planning?
glass,Thank you for what you done for me... stitchin' me back together... givin' me a chance.
henry,I'm offerin' you another right now... to stay here... let this thing go.
glass, He thinks he let me die. But he don't know that he's the one that's kept me alive... for the chance of findin' him... makin' him pay for what he done.
henry,The law will make Fitzgerald pay.
glass,"You told me once that other men didn't think like him.  Do you, Captain?"
murphy,He said he was goin' to get his rifle...
pig,And the Captain found the money gone.
glass,I'll make my way down river. See what turns up.
stubby bill,The kid's gone... gear and all. Musta slipped out before light.
henry," ""Every day I think about what I done. I want to tell Pig and the others the truth but am afraid what they'll think of me. I look at Fitzgerald and want to kill him but am afraid to try. I am a coward and wish he hadn't been lyin about the Ree that night. I wish they had come and kilt us both."""
glass,"If I run across the boy, I'll send him back your way."
henry,Fitzgerald stole five hundred dollars. Rocky Mountain Fur Company wants him too.
glass,I can do this on my own.
henry,I know you can. But maybe you won't have to.
runty man,"We ain't got no food to spare, friend, if that's what you're lookin' for."
fitzgerald,Then what the hell have ya got?
runty man,Whiskey and blankets mostly. Weather's held back deliveries.
fitzgerald,Gimme a couple bottles then. Goddamn ice shredded my boat. Been walkin' for two days.
runty man,Horses ain't cheap this time a year.
fitzgerald,"Whatever the price, Rocky Mountain Fur Company's good for it."
runty man,You're the second son of a bitch come in here makin' that claim. And the first one left a bad taste.
fitzgerald,That right? Well I don't know nothin' about that. Just that I need a horse.
runty man,So did this other fella. So he stole one... along with Lange's pistola.
fitzgerald,"Fine then, I'll pay cash for the horse. How much?"
runty man,How `bout you pay for your friend's too.
fitzgerald,Wasn't my friend.
fitzgerald,"Yeah, okay. I'll collect from him. How much?"
runty man,How `bout we say eighty...  ...five.
fitzgerald,You boys are leavin' me with nothin'. Better be a helluva horse.
runty man,Pick of the litter.
fitzgerald,When I see who?
runty man,The black son of a bitch that robbed me. You tell him that.
fitzgerald,"Scarred up, you say... and headed up to Union?"
runty man,That's what he told us. Seemed real anxious to get there too.
fitzgerald, I'll make sure to give him the message when I find him.
henry,Hugh.
glass,Ice tore it up.
henry,What's out that direction? Talbot?
glass,"And the Missouri. Doubt he'd risk the river with the `Ree. Likely grab a horse, and cross over high... take his chances goin' east against the weather. When'd you say he skipped out?"
henry,Three days ago now.
glass,We best pick up our pace.
henry,This was Fitzgerald camped here?
glass,Couple nights back. But these tracks aren't all his.
henry,He's travelin' with somebody?
glass, Came in after. Prints are smooth. Mocassins.
henry,But you figure they're `Ree.
glass,"I don't figure nothin', Captain. But whoever it is, they're a good day behind Fitzgerald."
henry,You told me once you knew enough to keep away from the `Ree.
glass,I do.
henry,You figure this is smart then?
glass,"You're welcome to head back, Captain."
henry,What if we find Fitzgerald... and I ask you not to do this?
glass,Don't ask me.
henry, `Ree?
glass,Wait!
henry,So much for stayin' quiet.
henry,Guess you would've been better off on your own.
glass,We needed to pick up some time anyways.
henry,Whatta ya got?
glass,Smoke.
henry,What if it's `Ree?
glass,Then we leave `em be... meet back up here.
fitzgerald,"Didn't figure an important man like you to be away from your stove on a night as cold as this, Captain. You lost?"
henry,I'm here to save your life.
fitzgerald,I done told you boys... I don't need savin' by you or nobody else.
glass,You shouldn't a come.
fitzgerald, Glass... please!
glass,I am Tatanka Wicasa! I have killed whites and I have killed Arikara and I have killed grizzly! AND I WILL KILL YOU!
