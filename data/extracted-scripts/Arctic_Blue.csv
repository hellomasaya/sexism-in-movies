Speaker,Dialogue
end dream," 2    INT.  DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT  Eric bolts up in bed.  Next to him, ANNE MARIE GAUVIN sits up and hugs him.  All that can be seen of her in the dark is a lovely silhouette and a cascade of dark hair.  After a moment, Eric kisses her.  He shakes off the dream and lies back down.  3    EXT.  HAUL ROAD AND PIPELINE - CLOSE - DAY  A metal sign, peppered with shotgun holes, is posted near a pipeline support piling:"
eric,"What a beauty.  Hand me the transmitter.  Anne Marie passes to Eric a tiny, weatherproof homing device attached to a steel collar band.  Eric puts the collar loosely around the wolf's neck and crimps it in place, all the while TALKING soothingly to the semi-conscious animal. Anne Marie smiles at Eric's tenderness and snaps some photos.  With the collar in place and transmitter activated, Eric backs away while the wolf tries to rouse itself from its narcosis."
eric, He's coming around fine.
anne marie,Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.
eric,Anne Marie!  Stop!  She glances down.  Something metal is half-buried in the dead leaves and gravel.
eric," Don't move.  Eric runs over.  He pokes at the object with a stick.  With a SNAP, a steel leg trap chomps the stick in half.  Anne Marie jumps back.  Eric brushes the dead leaves on the ground behind her and she carefully backtracks out of the gully."
eric," Goddamn trappers!  He angrily rips the trap out of the ground, unearthing several others attached to one another by a long chain."
eric," Takes nerve, laying traplines on restricted land.  Eric slips the scope off the dart rifle and climbs up the pipeline on foot pegs to the top of an anchoring poINT."
anne marie,What are you doing?
eric,"He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.  HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE  The road and the pipeline stretch toward either horizon, north and south.  In the distance, a jeep is parked on the Haul Road.  Near it, a Man climbs down into another shallow ravine.  BACK TO SCENE  Eric hurries down the footpegs."
eric,"Man and a jeep, about a mile and a half down.  He jumps into the Scout.  Anne Marie stuffs her cameras into the hatchback.  As soon as she climbs in, Eric tears out.  4    INT.  SCOUT -   Eric stomps on the gas.  The dust from the jeep obscures his view but he's gaining on them anyway.  Anne Marie hangs on and squints her eyes against the choking dust."
lemalle,"Where the fuck did you drop Corbett off?  In the passenger seat, MITCHELL , chews tobacco and looks grim.  He's a squat, flat-faced Okie, with curly matted hair and tired grey eyes.  He's dressed in a brown long coat and has a Colt .45 Peacemaker in a quick-draw holster strapped to his leg.  Despite his intimidating air, confrontation is not his style.  He spots a figure up ahead, where the road crosses a muddy creek."
mitchell,"He's over there.  9    EXT.  HAUL ROAD  Turning sharply, the trappers' jeep splashes through the creek bed without slowing.  Bouncing, it comes down hard against the axle-deep bank at the creek's high water mark. LeMalle tries to back out, but can't find traction in the mud.  Eric stops the Scout thirty yards behind them.  10   INT.  SCOUT  Eric opens his door.  To Anne Marie:"
eric,Stay here.
anne marie,Be careful -- there're two of them.  Eric reaches in the back seat and hands something to Anne Marie.
eric,"If I unzip my parka, stick this out the window.  11   EXT.  HAUL ROAD  Eric confidently approaches the jeep."
corbett," No shooting.  Let's see who's so interested in us.  Corbett has an incongruously affable voice.  He throws his traps into the jeep, then strides closer toward Eric."
mitchell," Ain't worth it, Ben...  13   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSING - LONG SHOT  As Corbett comes closer, Eric realizes this might not've been a great idea.  Corbett squints his eyes and sniffs the air, as if by this he can gauge his opponent's mettle."
eric,You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
corbett,"Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid."
eric,"I got your plate number, asshole. Maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail.  Corbett just smiles."
lemalle,Ben?  Sure you don't want me to drop the fucker?
eric,"You leave and don't come back, that's the end of it.  After a long moment, Corbett smiles again, then turns away from Eric.  He motions LeMalle to the front of the jeep.  Frustrated, LeMalle slams back the safety on the carbine and throws it in the back seat.  ANGLE ON TRAPPERS  Mitchell climbs into the jeep and starts the engine. LeMalle and Corbett rock the jeep back and forth in the rut. While pushing, Corbett rips the sole of his boot on a sharp piece of granite.   He cusses and pushes harder.  14   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSING  Eric walks back to the Scout.  He feels the trappers' eyes on his back, but forces himself not to hurry.  The trappers free their vehicle.  Corbett gets in the driver's seat, and they take off.  15   INT.  SCOUT  Anne Marie's hands are shaking as she pulls the plastic tranquilizer rifle back in the window."
anne marie, Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
eric,"Bastards took off, though, didn't they?  16   EXT.  BOREAL FOREST - LATER THAT DAY  The trappers have left the flatlands of the Haul Road area. Now their jeep climbs a pathway over the rolling foothills.  17   INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP -   Corbett broods while driving.  Mitchell looks out the window.  The silence makes LeMalle uncomfortable."
lemalle,"All this fuckin' land, and we're locked out.  Makes me puke."
corbett,Jawing about it won't change it.
lemalle,Three hundred seventy-five million acres in this state.  I'm real tired of runnin' into people.
mitchell,"Then don't look to your left.  18   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP  A brand-new Land Rover is parked on an alluvial fan in a bend in a small river.  Scattered about is an assortment of expensive camping gear, beer cans, spent shells and other garbage.  Three toy-macho, vacationing SPORTSMEN are guzzling beer and BLASTING fish in the shallow river with 12-gauge shotguns. They look up and glower suspiciously as the jeep slows and stops.  19   INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP  LeMalle grabs his carbine."
corbett,Leave it here.
mitchell,Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
corbett," Relax.  I just want to ask them how the hunting is.  20   EXT.  SPORTSMEN'S CAMP  Corbett gets out of the jeep.  He regards the Sportsmen, their shotguns and their mess with ill-concealed contempt.  The Sportsmen clutch their weapons and watch Corbett.  He walks around the camp, spotting a rubber-lined rucksack stuffed with dead ermine.  After a long, tense moment, Corbett smiles."
corbett,Looks like you've had some luck. Where's your guide?
corbett, You did real good.  He crouches next to the dead animals and strokes the fur.
lemalle, No swinging shit.  They're over their goddamned limit.
corbett," My friend is right.  Supposed to have a licensed guide when you're on this land, too."
corbett," This was my roaming land, 'til the government took it over. Only Innuit can hunt here now, and tourists, like you.  Corbett swings the rucksack of carcasses onto the hood of the Land Rover.  Pissed, Sportsmen #1 and #2 step closer to him."
corbett," According to tribal law, hunters passing through the land of another tribe can only take game to survive.  They can eat the meat, but have to surrender the hides.  LeMalle pulls a hunting knife and holds up one of the ermine."
lemalle,Want the meat?
lemalle,"I say shoot 'em, bury 'em with their shiny new car."
mitchell," If you're gonna take something, take it and let's go.  Corbett looks down to fasten the top of the rucksack."
corbett," Let's go.  As Corbett walks to the jeep, he's too angry to notice that he's stepped in a patch of mud under the Land Rover.  Near the jeep, LeMalle stops and pulls them into a huddle."
lemalle," I don't believe in leavin' witnesses behind, Ben."
mitchell,It was self defense.  Leave it at that.
lemalle,You think those fucks will tell it that way?
corbett, We'll get a head start before they go crying to the law.  Corbett turns and FIRES two rounds from his .44 into the engine of the Land Rover.  The Sportsmen stare and sputter.
corbett," You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season."
lemalle,"Think I'm pretty?  You better forget how we look, 'cause next time they won't keep me from killing you.  This land ain't quite civilized, you know...  He unsheathes his buck knife.  BELOW FRAME, he slices across the forehead of the dead Sportsman, peels back his scalp and cuts it loose, Indian-style.  The Sportsmen are stunned and sickened.  ANGLE ON TRAPPERS' JEEP  Corbett looks at Mitchell and wearily shakes his head."
mitchell,"At least he scalped the dead one.  21   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DUSK  Devil's Cauldron Hot Springs is a cluster of twenty tiny dwellings connected by an unpainted boardwalk.  The town squats, ugly and temporary-looking, in a dirt clearing fifty miles north of the Arctic Circle.  Thirty miles east of the Pipeline, it's almost dead center of interior Alaska.  At the edge of town is a gravel airstrip.  Mixed with the prospector-era sod-roof cabins are a few prefabricated houses.  The boon brought by men building the pipeline is long gone.  Now only a few itinerant loggers, natives and bush dwellers remain to fight boredom, each other and the depression of the oncoming winter.  Enough steam escapes from the hot springs to perpetually blanket the valley with fog.  The spa is log-walled and horseshoe- shaped, with partitioned baths inside.  Facing it"
leo meyerling,"for State Legislature VOTE FOR THE PEOPLE'S FRIEND!  22   EXT.  KENAI'S GENERAL STORE  Corbett and the other trappers drive past Meyerling and park their jeep as the sun disappears behind the foothills.  23   INT.  KENAI'S GENERAL STORE  A handwritten public notice next to a schedule of church meetings reads: ""Live each day so you can look every damn man in the eye and tell him to go to hell.""  There is a post office in the corner with some combination boxes and a wicketless window.  The trappers come in.  Corbett sits in a chair and pulls his boots off.  One of his wool socks is wet.  He nods to the man sitting in the other chair, SAM WILDER.  Wilder is short and tough, with a full head of crewcut grey hair and weather- ravaged face that makes him look older than his sixty years."
corbett,"Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?"
wilder," Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way."
corbett,", wearing thick glasses, several heavy sweaters and battery-heated socks, fusses behind the counter.  He's EARL KENAI, owner of the hot springs spa and the general store.  LeMalle chews on a handful of bear jerky.  Kenai stares at LeMalle until he begrudgingly pays for the jerky.  Corbett pulls on some sneakers and hands his boots to Kenai."
corbett, Needs patching.
kenai,Twenty-five dollar.
corbett, Sure have learned to worship the white man's god.  Kenai nods agreeably and holds his hand out.  Corbett pays him.  Meyerling comes in and posts some fliers on the corkboard.
meyerling,I hope I can count on you gentlemen to vote for The People's Friend this November.
corbett,"Share some of that oil company money in your pocket and you can.  Meyerling smiles like a toad, then slaps another poster on the wall.  LeMalle throws his knife and it STICKS in the poster between Meyerling's spread fingers.  Meyerling jumps back and the trappers laugh.  Meyerling looks to Wilder for support."
wilder, One flier comes loose and I shoot you for littering.
meyerling, Have your fun... just remember The People's Friend come election day.
wilder, Oil Company candidate running on that slogan makes about as much sense as a rat fucking a grapefruit.
corbett,"Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks."
lemalle, How about a quart of Jack Daniel's?
kenai,How about it is right.  Back in the primary this town was voted dry.
lemalle," Aw, shit.  Let's go.  Leave a note for Viking Bob, tell him to meet us in Cache."
corbett,"Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?"
wilder,I'm living proof of that sad fact.
corbett,Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
wilder,"No, I better stay at my post.  Even without the hootch riling 'em up, you know how mean-spirited folks get when they smell winter coming.  24   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON VALLEY - LONG SHOT - NIGHT  An early STORM has blown in from the north, bringing whipping winds and freezing rain.  25   INT.  RENTAL CABIN  Corbett peers out the tiny window, frowning.  LeMalle cleans his carbine while eating beans and bacon.  Mitchell hunches over a table.  He's making a scrimshaw -- delicately engraving, using homemade tools, on a palm-sized piece of whale bone.  He rubs his eyes and looks up at Corbett."
mitchell,So much for the walking weather you predicted.
corbett,Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
mitchell,I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
lemalle,"Fuck you, Mitchell.  Woulda been my ass if Ben didn't waste that prick."
corbett," Mitchell, look, it don't take three of us to wait for Viking Bob.  Mitchell glances at LeMalle, then at Corbett."
corbett, Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
mitchell,Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
corbett,"Leave my traps.  We'll tag up, couple days.  26   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - ""THE TURTLE"" - DAY  The winds have died down.  The rain has turned to a light snow.  A mobile arctic dwelling sits on a rise next to the Haul Road.  It's a double-unit weathertight cocoon of fiberglass and aluminum, pulled by a diesel rig on oversized tires. The front module is 12 by 24, the rear 12 by 18.  An extended-cab pickup pulls up and Sam Wilder gets out. The gravel-and-dirt Haul Road, paralleling the pipeline for 400 miles, is closed to the public.  An arriving vehicle, therefore, is news.  The front door of the dwelling opens. Eric and Anne Marie come outside, delighted to see Wilder."
wilder,"I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up."
eric,Thanks.
anne marie, I bet you haven't had lunch.
wilder, Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
eric,-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.  Anne Marie shoots a look at Eric but doesn't disagree -- this is obviously an issue with them.  Wilder looks with amusement at the mobile dwelling.
wilder,What'd you say they call these spaceships?
eric,Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
anne marie,"I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back."
eric,"Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us."
anne marie, The little creep hates it that Eric actually does what the company hired him to do.
wilder,Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
eric,"Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke."
wilder,Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
eric,We'll go with you.
wilder,Stupid goddamn greenhorns!  Froze to death.
anne marie,It's not even winter!
wilder,"They got wet in the rain.  Core body temperature dropped, got drowsy, probably didn't even know what was happening.  Eric stares at the dead Sportsmen."
wilder, Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.
eric,"They had Emergency Locater Transmitters, but didn't use them.  Maybe because they didn't bring batteries."
wilder,I'm too old for this shit.
eric,"Any idea who could've done it?  Sourly, Wilder points to a patch of frozen mud under the vehicle."
wilder,A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
wilder," Even for Ben Corbett, this is nasty.  Man's got balls.  He was sitting in Devil's Cauldron when I left, calm as can be."
anne marie,Thank God.  You can arrest him.
wilder,"Not necessarily.  Corbett's awful hardbitten these days.  Wilder leans against the Land Rover, feeling tired."
wilder," Won't be able to take him by my lonesome, though.  Nobody in town'll lift a finger on this.  Eric looks hard at the dead Sportsmen."
eric, I'll go into town with you.
anne marie,"Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business."
eric, No way can he get away with this. I'll be back by tonight.  29   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - AFTERNOON  The town is quiet.
eric,Ben Corbett?
corbett,Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
eric,Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
corbett,"No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?  Eric glances down at Corbett's duffel bag, which sits on the floor next to Corbett's tub.  Corbett's magnum rests on top of it, well within reach.  Corbett notices Eric's interest in it.  He leans back and smiles."
eric,Desmond.
corbett,"New to the country, kid?"
eric,Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
corbett,"Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.  Putting his hand on Dixie's shoulder, Corbett stands and gets out of the tub.  His sinewy body, resembling a scarecrow made of steel cable, is covered with scars.  He wraps a towel around his waist and crosses to Eric."
corbett," Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.  Corbett grabs his boots from Eric and finds himself facing a revolver, which Eric has been hiding inside one of the boots."
corbett, You wouldn't shoot anyone...
corbett,All this for laying traps on private land?
wilder,"You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.  Corbett shakes his head but remains implacable."
corbett,Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
wilder, I got it from here.  Thanks.
corbett," Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?  31   EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA  Eric comes outside.  Earl Kenai, overdressed for the weather in gloves, mukluks and a full-length sealskin coat, stands"
kenai,"Before white men came, my people lived in sod houses underground and laid our dead on the tundra. Now we live above ground and bury our dead, and we haven't been warm since.  Wilder comes out of the spa with his shotgun and Corbett's duffel bag cradled in his arm.  Handcuffed, Corbett walks in front of him.  Kenai looks down to avoid eye contact with Corbett as he goes by.  Corbett stops next to Eric and smiles."
corbett,"Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe."
eric," Yeah.  Maybe so.  32   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - FOLLOW WILDER  as he leads Corbett along the boardwalk to the other end of town.  They approach a prefab house perched on skids under a tall antenna tower.  Mounted above the shack, a DC wind charger turbine spins lazily in the faint breeze.  From within the cabin comes an anomalous SOUND -- MTV.  Wilder KNOCKS on the door.  ARTHUR NEFF, a pasty-white, 45-year-old ex-Texan, pulls the door open.  His customary grin fades when he sees Corbett.  33   INT.  NEFF'S HOUSE  Wilder pushes Corbett inside past Neff."
wilder,I need to call Fairbanks.  Neff just stares at Corbett.
wilder," Neff!  Dial it up.  State police.  With a ""what can I do but oblige?"" look to Corbett, Neff sits in front of the RCA Alascom radio telephone and dials."
neff," Fairbanks Alascom?  Patch me through to the State Police.  After a moment, he hands the receiver to Wilder.  Wilder takes it, keeping one eye and the shotgun on Corbett."
wilder," This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands."
wilder, Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
wilder, This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
corbett,Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?  Wilder does mind.  He locks the duffel bag and Corbett's .44 in his desk drawer.
corbett," Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first."
wilder,"If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?"
corbett, I'll get loose before that plane comes.
wilder,"Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.  35   EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - AFTERNOON  As Eric walks into Kenai's general store, Neff hurries over."
neff,Mr. Desmond!  Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.
eric,Sure.
neff,"Snowplow, generator, TV dish... hell, we get the goddamn Playboy Channel!  Here, this is for you.  He hands Eric a piece of styrofoam shaped like a commode seat."
neff,"  Warm to forty below.  Remember, anything you want, you ask Arthur Neff.  36   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE - NIGHT  The storm has passed.   A faint CHUGGING emanates from the small orange generator trailer behind the Turtle.  Eric pulls up and parks the Scout.  37   INT.  THE TURTLE  Nylon storage netting along the ceiling holds Eric's research equipment and Anne Marie's photographic supplies. In one corner of the Turtle are several of her black and white prints.  All are of man-made objects whose presence is juxtaposed with the natural surroundings.  Relieved he's home in one piece, Anne Marie meets Eric at the door and kisses him.  Carrying a brown-paper-wrapped package, Eric follows her into the kitchen, where she's preparing dinner."
anne marie,Did you catch Corbett?
eric,Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
anne marie,Was there any trouble?
eric,He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
anne marie,"Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric."
eric," Oh, I found this at the post office.  Had your name on it."
anne marie,"Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!"
eric,You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
anne marie,I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
eric, You make it sound like a prison sentence.
anne marie,That's not what I meant.
eric,It's exactly what you meant.
anne marie,"Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --"
eric,-- Permanently?
anne marie, So shut up and let's eat.
viking bob,"I'm looking for some trappers. Ben Corbett, Mitchell, LeMalle. Seen 'em?"
neff,"Yesterday.  Said they were going to Cache.  They were thirsty, but we were voted dry."
viking bob,Shit.
viking bob,These yours?
kenai,"Gonna make an offer.  Man who owns them won't need them where he's going.  39   INT.  WILDER'S CABIN  Wilder peers out the window and sees Viking Bob, then turns to Corbett."
wilder,"Back against the bars.  Now.  Wilder handcuffs Corbett's hands to the cell door bars, then quickly wraps a piece of duct tape across Corbett's face, covering his mouth.  Stuffing a .357 magnum in his belt, Wilder, coatless, slips outside.  As soon as he's out the door, Corbett cranes his neck and painfully tries to pry the tape off his face with the corner of the door hinge.  40   EXT.  WILDER'S CABIN  The look on Wilder's face tells Kenai to shut up.  Viking Bob realizes something's up."
wilder,Your brother and the boys left me some traps to sell for them. They're gone --
viking bob,-- To Cache.  So I heard.  Ben never said nothing to me about selling his gear.  41   INT.  WILDER'S CABIN  Corbett gets the tape partially off his mouth.  He pries one of his boots off and kicks it through a window.
corbett,Bob!  They got me on a murder charge!  42   EXT.  WILDER'S CABIN  Wilder pulls his .357 out.
wilder,"Sorry, Bob.  I'll have to keep you here 'til I ship him south.  Viking Bob responds by flinging a heavy trap at Wilder, then punching him in the gut.  Wilder sprawls among the junk, dropping his revolver.  Kenai freezes, not about to take sides.  Before Viking Bob can come at him again, Wilder grabs for"
wilder," You stupid, greedy, loudmouth sonofabitch!  He'll have the others here in a few hours.  You fucked me up, now you're gonna help me move him."
kenai," Forget it, Sam.  I never work for free.  43   INT.  THE TURTLE - NIGHT  Anne Marie sits on the floor, editing one of her VIDEOTAPES. On the monitor, it SHOWS footage of the traps under the pipeline piling.  Eric comes out of the back module holding two ELT pendants.  He glances over at the monitor and nods approvingly."
anne marie,I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?
eric,"I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.  Eric activates the ELT's.  They emit an SOS pattern of radio waves -- three short, three long and three short.  This is visible as rhythmic INTERFERENCE on Anne Marie's video MONITOR."
eric, Avalanche season is coming.
anne marie,Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
eric,Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
anne marie,Not me.  I'm equipped.  She turns on a small S-VHS video camera and snaps off the room lights.
anne marie," Allow me to give you a practical demonstration of low-light infrared photography...  She does so by seductively undressing for the camera.  She's SEEN on the MONITOR, illuminated by the ""light"" from the hot stove.  Eric appreciates the show.  He crawls toward her."
anne marie," High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too."
eric,Come here...
viking bob,"Ben?  No answer.  Viking Bob looks in the cab.  Kenai's passenger is Dixie, the Inupiat hooker.  Viking Bob grabs Kenai and pushes the barrel of the shotgun hard against his cheek."
viking bob, Where's Ben Corbett?
kenai,"I have no argument with you, Bob. Wilder said I could keep his truck if I drove it ten miles away from town."
viking bob,Where did they go?
kenai,"He didn't say, but I would guess the opposite way from here.  Viking Bob shoves Kenai against the truck, then punches him for good measure.  Cussing, he runs back to his station wagon and drives off."
wilder,"I got an emergency on my hands.  Corbett smiles at Eric as he walks inside.  48   INT.  THE TURTLE  Eric, Wilder and Corbett sit in the front module.  Anne Marie, nervous, wearing a down robe, serves coffee.  She stares at Corbett, trying to reconcile his quiet demeanor with what she saw that afternoon.  Corbett smiles at Eric."
wilder," ...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours."
eric,That's what we should've done in the first place.
wilder,"I could've sat tight for the transport, 'til Bob came poking around."
corbett," A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --"
eric, -- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
wilder, You better get some sleep.
corbett,"Good idea.  Flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises.  Go too low, one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it."
eric," I'll get you there all right.  Eric takes Anne Marie to the rear module, leaving Wilder with his prisoner."
wilder,"Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it."
corbett,"I don't want to hurt you, Sam."
wilder,I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
corbett,"Nothing personal.  Wilder's mind clears enough to realize that Corbett's hands are in front of him.  He reaches for his .357.  Corbett butts into Wilder's midsection with his head.  Amazingly, Wilder stays on his feet.  Corbett hurries back to the door.  Wilder lunges, bull-determined to hold onto him.  Corbett smashes Wilder across the face with his clenched hands.  Wilder goes down hard, hitting his head on the table, and stays there. Corbett instinctively kneels to see if Wilder is still breathing.  But then, hearing MOVEMENT in the rear module, Corbett flees."
eric,"You want to try that handgun against this rifle, go ahead.  Corbett sits in the Scout for a long moment, weighing his odds.  He takes his hands off the steering wheel...  Eric SHOOTS again, this time SMASHING the side-view mirror and window next to Corbett's head.  Still handcuffed, Corbett gets out of the Scout.  Holding the .357 gingerly by the butt, he puts it on the hood of the Scout."
corbett,Some day you might have to face me without a gun.  53   INT.  THE TURTLE  Eric leads Corbett in.  Anne Marie is cradling Wilder's head. She's crying.  Eric looks at Wilder.  There is blood coming from his ear and he's fading fast.
wilder," Don't let him walk...  Eric nods again.  Wilder holds his gaze on Eric, then simply stops breathing."
corbett, Does he have people?
eric, A daughter in Oregon.
corbett,"Send him down to her.  There's money in my duffel bag, back at his cabin.  Corbett's benign attitude is chilling."
eric,I better call in.  He turns the shortwave radio on.  It SPARKS and burns out. The remainder of the liquor has been poured inside it.
eric," Thought of everything, huh?"
corbett,Surviving is what I know --
eric,"-- Killing is what you know.  - NIGHT  Viking Bob approaches in his station wagon on a narrow dirt road.  The huge night sky all but smothers the weak light from the town up ahead.  Cache seems a mistake -- a jumble of unpainted buildings in the middle of a big nothing, twenty miles north of the Arctic Circle.  Still, it's more animated than Devil's Cauldron.  There are a hundred permanent residents, several taverns and a three-store, fly-in shopping center."
viking bob,LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
lemalle,"Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...  Grumbling, Viking Bob separates LeMalle from the Prostitute and drags him by the collar out of the alley."
mitchell, ...Ben never sent a signal.
viking bob,Musta never got a chance to -more-
mitchell,Meaning he'll need a plane.
viking bob,Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
mitchell,Hang on...  Remember that Cessna we saw at the pumping station on the Haul Road?  Belongs to the guy they got patrolling the pipeline.
lemalle,There you go.  Wilder's always chummy with the fuckin' Bambi-lovers.
viking bob,It's a long shot.
mitchell,"You got a better idea?  57   EXT.  HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE - DAWN  Wisps of light cut across the cold blue sky.  Eric comes out of the Turtle, leaving the front door ajar. He throws a knapsack of supplies into the back of the Scout.  58   INT.  THE TURTLE  Corbett's right hand is still handcuffed to the wall unit. Terrified about being alone with Corbett, Anne Marie cautiously puts a cup of coffee in front of him."
corbett,How long have you been up north?
anne marie, Six months.
corbett,Can't be.  Too keen a sense of this place in your pictures.
anne marie,Six months this time.  I was born in the Aleutians.
corbett,"Your people Alaskan?  Anne Marie doesn't want to talk to a killer, but Corbett is so soft-spoken and charming that she answers despite herself."
anne marie,My dad was a Navy doctor.
corbett,"Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes."
anne marie,Had?
corbett,She's dead.
anne marie,Oh.
corbett,"Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl."
anne marie,How did she..?
corbett,"I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-"
corbett, What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
anne marie,"That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.  As she's talking, the Turtle ROCKS slightly.  She looks out the tiny window.  HER POV - THROUGH WINDOW  Eric is putting Wilder's body inside an enclosed storage compartment built flush into the side of the Turtle.  BACK TO SCENE  Horrified, Anne Marie turns away."
corbett,You should know something.
anne marie,I don't want to talk any more.
corbett,"Wasn't my intention to hurt Wilder.  I'm telling you the truth.  I liked the man.  I only meant to get loose... to survive. Your cheechako boyfriend better understand that.  Listen, I've got some money put away --"
anne marie,"-- Don't ever think you can buy Eric off, Mr. Corbett --"
anne marie, Outsider.  He carefully stuffs Wilder's magnum in his belt and ignores Anne Marie's disparaging look as he does.
eric, Let's go.
anne marie,Wait a second.  59   INT.  THE TURTLE - REAR MODULE  Anne Marie leads Eric out of earshot from Corbett.  Eric keeps a cautious eye on him.
anne marie,"Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him."
eric," Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.  Realizing he's determined, she sighs and kisses him."
eric," Be careful, okay?"
anne marie,That's my line.
corbett,"Let me out and keep going.  They catch us, they'll kill you.  Eric doesn't need any convincing of that.  He tears out.  66   EXT.  PUMPING STATION  Mitchell runs out in front of them and BLASTS the front of the Scout with his .45 Peacemaker.  Steam HISSES out of the radiator.  Eric floors it and races past Mitchell, almost hitting him."
corbett,"They'll still catch us.  All you're doing is pissing them off.  76   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK  The gasoline can EXPLODES, tearing the bridge couplings away from the concrete abutment.  77   EXT.  HAUL ROAD  The trappers see the explosion behind them.  They turn around and head toward it.  78   EXT.  PUMPING STATION - HANGAR  Eric parks the Scout sideways to block the way to the airstrip.  With the magnum at the ready, Eric cuts Corbett's handcuffs loose from the seat and hurries him toward the hangar.  The leeward side of the structure is a huge metal door on rollers.  Eric unlocks it and rolls it back.  Inside is a Cessna 182, dusted with snow and ice blown through the cracks by crosswinds.  Eric brushes the windshield with his sleeve.  79   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK  The trappers pull up and find the far side of the bridge burning and disconnected from the creek bank.  80   INT.  HANGAR - CESSNA  Eric helps Corbett into the cockpit, then secures his handcuffs to the frame of the seat with more nylon rope.  81   EXT.  HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK  Viking Bob assesses the damage to the bridge.  Loose from the abutments, it wobbles like a diving board.  Below, the water is too deep and fast-moving to be traversable."
viking bob,"Get in.  We can jump it.  They hop in.  He SCREECHES backwards to get a running start, REVS the engine, pops the clutch, and tears toward the bridge.  As they reach the midpoint of the bridge it begins to buckle under them.  With a sickening WRENCHING, the crossbar supports crumple.  The jeep flies through the still-burning gasoline, becomes airborne, and SCRAPES to a rude stop on the edge of the pavement on the other side, the back wheels dangling in space.  LeMalle and Mitchell gingerly get out and push the ass end of the jeep onto solid earth.  84   INT.  HANGAR  Eric finally STARTS the plane and taxis out onto the landing strip.  85   EXT.  PUMPING STATION  The trappers drive up to where the Scout blocks their path. They pile out of their jeep and run toward the landing strip.  86   INT.  CESSNA -   Corbett scowls as he sees the trappers helpless below him."
eric,How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
corbett,Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.  Eric retracts the landing gear and banks toward the southwest.  Corbett notices that Eric seems a little unsure of the controls.
corbett, Been driving long?
eric,"I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks."
corbett,"That makes the flight more interesting.  Eric ignores the jibe.  He stays at 2,000 feet, making the landscape all the more immediate.  Corbett stares out the window and broods.  He spots an open, snow-covered area where some dark blotches mar the whiteness."
corbett," See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf."
eric,Sounds like professional jealousy.
corbett,"Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.   While talking in an even tone, Corbett intently studies the instrument panel and scans the landscape below."
corbett,"The idea was to get to the supplies before the bears did. Along the route we'd set our traps.  Made our year's living in three months.  Corbett spots a flat plateau farther in the mountains, above the tree line."
corbett,"  The lever, used to empty the fuel tanks in case of emergency, does so with great expediency.  All the gas is instantly discharged."
corbett,Hope you got your money's worth on those lessons.
eric,Stay put!
corbett,You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?  Eric cocks the gun's hammer with his thumb.
eric,"Be no different than shooting a rabid dog.  The men face off for a tense moment.  Corbett smiles and zips up his jacket, dispelling the tension.  Letting the hammer down, Eric looks back at the burning plane."
eric," Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me."
corbett,"I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory."
eric,"With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory."
corbett,You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.  Corbett drops his facade of conviviality.  Eric is too angry to be intimidated.  He takes the scarf from around his neck and wraps his ankle with it.
eric,Let's go.
corbett, I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
eric,That's right.  You're not.
corbett,"Look, take these cuffs off.  We need to work together."
eric,"Forget it.  Eric holds his wristwatch up, points the hour hand at the sun, counts forward to noon, and, accordingly, makes an approximation of their direction."
eric," Last time I checked the flight plan, we were forty miles northeast of Devil's Cauldron. Southwest is that way.  No sense waiting for a goddamn taxi.  Grimacing with pain, he gets up.  Clutching the magnum, he shoves Corbett in front of him and starts walking.  Corbett frowns -- it's tough to trudge through the snow with his arms cuffed tightly behind his back.  Eric looks around and tries not to let his emotions register on his face.  They wouldn't be farther from the rest of humanity on another planet.  Smelling fear on Eric, Corbett enjoys the view.  And waits.  95   EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - LATER THAT DAY  The Endicott range is full of jagged peaks, icy streams and gnarled tundra valleys.  Squinting in the glare of the snow, Eric and Corbett trek through the grandiose Gates of the Arctic area.  The smoldering plane wreckage is a hard-won, snow-covered mile behind them.  Intricate patterns of fragmented rock, strips of scruffy tundra and bedrock outcrops produce lonely, foreboding mosaics upon the landscape.  The air is still.  The silence  is itself a disconcerting presence.  Ten miles ahead and two thousand feet lower, the forest begins.  But here, on the rock face of the mountains, Eric and Corbett might as well be in a desert."
eric,"It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood."
corbett,"Welcome to the environment, Mr. Ecology.  Out here, one mistake is all you get.  Determined and dour, Eric pushes on."
corbett, Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
eric,I don't plan on dying.  It's all academic.  The sheer magnitude of the surroundings makes them feel they're the only people in the world.
eric,"We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter."
corbett,"Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.  Corbett sits on his haunches and smiles while Eric digs near the rocks.  Although he knows Corbett is testing his every move, Eric refuses to let his patronizing air get to him."
corbett," Even in the drifts, this snow's too powdery to make a shelter. When you're done jerking around, reach down the back of my coat.  Eric approaches him suspiciously.  He puts his hand down through Corbett's collar.  Something is stowed inside a homemade flap in the lining of his coat.  Eric pulls out a"
corbett,"Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --"
eric,"-- Turn around.  While poking the .357 in Corbett's ribs, Eric one-handedly unlocks Corbett's right manacle, pulls his arm through the granite elbow, then locks it back up again.  He's learning."
end dream," 100  EXT.  ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DAWN  The sun peeks over the mountain tops, drenching them with light and color."
corbett,Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
eric,"We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it."
corbett,"We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours."
eric,"I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.  Corbett is not about to be outdone in the guts department by someone with a Master's Degree."
corbett, Be my guest.
eric, I'm right behind you.
corbett,Wait 'til I'm across!
corbett,"Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?"
eric,It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
corbett,Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
eric, We've got another two hours of daylight.
corbett,"Pushing it is flat wrong.  All you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail.  Eric is not convinced.   Grumbling, Corbett gets up and takes the lead as they continue southward."
meyerling,I've been trying to raise you on the shortwave for two days.  He pushes past Anne Marie and goes into the Turtle.
anne marie,Have you talked to Eric?
meyerling,"I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?"
anne marie,I was hoping you had some news --
meyerling,"-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --"
anne marie,-- Corbett's a killer.
meyerling,"I don't care if Ben Corbett makes meatloaf out of nuns and babies, he's not your concern. Understood?  Anne Marie just glares at him.  Meyerling examines the damaged shortwave."
meyerling, What happened here?
anne marie,The radio's on the fritz.
meyerling,Where'd you say Eric is?
anne marie,Somewhere along the pipeline.
meyerling,"What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess."
anne marie,Sam?  We haven't seen him.
meyerling,Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
anne marie, Why?
meyerling,"It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.  Noting Anne Marie's distressed reaction to this news, he crosses to the door."
meyerling, Suit yourself.
corbett,"Have to backtrack, find another way down."
eric,Forget it.  It would take days.
corbett," Going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on.  Eric realizes he's right.  After some deliberation, Eric cautiously approaches him.  With the .357 cocked and ready, he undoes one of the cuffs, leaving them hanging from Corbett's wrist.  He then unthreads the nylon twine from Corbett's tarp.  ANGLE - GRANITE SHEER  Eric and Corbett are tied, belt to belt, with the nylon rope.  Corbett inches down first, feet spread for maximum footing, gloveless hands grasping at anything.  Eric mimics Corbett's moves and follows the same path. Unable to grasp the rocks effectively, he stops and takes his gloves off.  Continuing, he winces -- the rock is cold and sharp.  His hands are soon numb and bloody.  Even in the dry, below-freezing air, Eric is sweating.  He looks down and hangs on more tightly.  Sliding to level ground two hundred feet below would pummel him to hamburger. Corbett pauses and rests his cheek against the rocks.  Eric is right above him."
corbett,"Better get into those trees before that squall blows down.  Then, Corbett pauses as a walloping sound ECHOES across the foothills.  Just ahead, two enormous bull moose are fighting.  They ram each other with six-foot-wide antlers.  Corbett stares, transfixed, admiring."
corbett,You talk about ecology -- there it is.
mitchell,You'll want to hear about it with a drink in your mitt.
logger,We should pass a hat.  Send Corbett a few bucks.  We owe him.  Someone's hat comes off.  It quickly gets filled with bills.
logger,Hold it.  Meyerling told me that stuff's nothing but P.R. for the TV and papers down in Juneau.
lemalle,He's full of shit.  We got run out of there by some fuckhead driving a Northland truck.
viking bob,"I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!"
lemalle,Get the fuck out of here.
viking bob,It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
lemalle,Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
mitchell,"Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town."
viking bob,That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
lemalle,Wilder still woulda made Fairbanks by now.  Fuck a duck! Ben musta got loose.
viking bob,"Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?"
mitchell, We were just talking about him.  111  EXT.  FOREST - CAMPSITE PREPARATION MONTAGE - EVENING  The STORM brings gusting winds and below-zero temperatures. Eric and Corbett move through the storm in slow motion. Both recognize the need for a truce in the face of a common enemy.  The snow and wind cut through their clothing like razors.  They poke around for dead wood with which to make a fire.  The trees are small and healthy; little is found.
corbett," Just gather birch.  It'll smoke like hell, but it'll burn green.  Awestruck by the intensity of the storm, Eric tears branches from birch trees and piles them in Corbett's handcuffed arms.  They hurry back to the nylon tarp, strung between two tree trunks, FLAPPING violently in the storm.  Hunching against the wind, Eric pulls off his gloves and reaches in his pocket for some precious matches.  His fingers are so cold he can't hold them, and he drops several in the wet snow.  Angry, he shoots a look at Corbett. Corbett is holding his hands inside his coat.  He pulls them out and quickly takes the remaining matches from Eric.  Crouching down, back to the wind, Corbett grasps a match between his numb fingers and awkwardly strikes it.  He holds the flame next to the kindling.  It doesn't catch fire immediately.  Corbett lets the match burn out against his fingers.  He tries another match.  This time, a flame takes hold but could succumb to the wind at any moment.  On his knees and elbows, Corbett nurses along the tiny fire. Eric can't control his shivering.  He gets on his knees next to Corbett and holds his coat open to further baffle the wind.  Corbett keeps his hands cupped around the flame, not"
end montage," 112  EXT. / INT.  NYLON SHELTER - NIGHT  Corbett and Eric sit under the nylon shelter.  The STORM rages outside.  Eric empties his pockets of Eskimo potato, reindeer lichens, bistsort sorrel and other plants for his dinner.  Corbett has fashioned a snare from his boot laces and a tree branch, and placed some crushed roots as aromatic bait next to a small animal burrow outside the shelter.  A squirrel sticks his nose out of the burrow to investigate.  Corbett sits catlike, ready to pounce.  Eric grimaces as Corbett yanks on the snare and the squirrel's SQUEALS  abruptly cease.  113  INT.  NYLON SHELTER  Corbett pulls his dead dinner inside."
corbett,"I need your pocket knife.  I have to eat, too.  After a beat, Eric pulls open the small blade on his Swiss Army knife and pushes it with his foot to Corbett.  Smiling, Corbett admires the fancy knife.  Then, BELOW FRAME, he skins and guts his catch."
corbett," Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put."
eric,"It could blow over tomorrow, too."
corbett,I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb.
eric,I just want this over with.
corbett, Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
eric,You know Meyerling?
corbett,Sure.  The People's Friend.  Kiss your ass with precision if there's a vote in it.
corbett," Always eat your meat raw when the weather's cold.  Does you more good, long as the entrails look clean.  Corbett uses snow and the squirrel's fur to wipe the blood from his face, then wipes the knife off and lays it, open, next to his leg."
eric,"I'll hold onto that.  With a wry smile, Corbett pushes it back over to Eric. While Eric eats his dinner, Corbett listens to the STORM and watches him eat."
corbett,Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
eric,I'm here to do my job.
corbett,"You want to fool yourself about that bullshit job, fine.  Damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along.  You think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man -more-"
eric,Don't fucking insult me.  Corbett smiles -- maybe he's beginning to understand Eric.
corbett,"Folks come to Alaska for a real short list of reasons:  Money. Adventure.  Solitude.  Those cover most everyone.  But frontiers also draw another type of man.  One with a demon in his gut.  He comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to rest."
eric,Yeah?
corbett,"Yep.  Sometimes they do, but usually they end up crazy or dead.  Eric ponders Corbett's words as he eats.  114  INT.  THE TURTLE - NIGHT  Anne Marie is frantic with worry.  She has the AM/FM RADIO on for company."
corbett,"There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here."
eric, Too bad we're heading west.
corbett,There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
eric," You don't get it, do you?  Corbett takes advantage of Eric's poor peripheral vision from the visor by kneeing Eric in the face.  Eric falls backwards into the snow.  Corbett takes off like a jackrabbit.  Eric spits out some blood, shakes the stars out of his eyes and yanks the .357 from under his coat."
eric, Stop!
corbett,"Nothing personal.  Just wanted to see what you'd do.  Noticing Corbett's sopping legs, Eric becomes furious."
corbett, Have to get these wet things off.
eric,You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
corbett,"Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.  Fuming, Eric helps Corbett up.  118  EXT.  ENDICOTT FOOTHILLS - EVENING  The sun sinks below the horizon, creating across the mountains a spectacular show of color and shadows.  The wind HOWLS.  119  INT.  NYLON SHELTER  Eric stokes a fire at the mouth of the shelter.  Corbett's pants and boots hang to dry from branches next to it.  He huddles under the tarp, covered by his coat, drowsy and listless."
eric,Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
corbett,"If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.  Eric examines him.  Corbett's skin is white and rigid, his lips are pale blue.  He scowls at Eric."
corbett, Told you I'm fine!
eric, How many do you see?
corbett, What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
eric,You don't feel cold?
corbett,"It's a spring day...  He starts to doze off.  The shivering he's been repressing now racks his body.  Eric sits him up, closer to the fire, and puts his own parka over Corbett's shoulders.  With his foot, Eric rolls some hot rocks bordering the fire closer to"
eric,"Wake up, goddammit!  You've got classic hypothermia -- crankiness, fatigue, can't feel your coldness.  Worst thing you can do is fade out.  Corbett is headed someplace far away.  Sighing, Eric turns him so his back faces the fire.  He unbuttons Corbett's shirt, then unbuttons his own shirt and lies across Corbett. Eric gasps -- Corbett feels like a slab of ice.  Corbett's teeth chatter.  He's completely unconscious."
eric," One more thing -- this doesn't mean we're going steady.  DISSOLVE TO:  Later, Corbett rests fitfully.  It could go either way. Eric chews on some roots and pokes at the fire to keep it lively.  DISSOLVE TO:  It's night.  Some color has returned to Corbett's skin. Eric turns as Corbett mumbles and clutches at the front of his shirt.  His eyes open.  He tries to sit up, but he's too weak."
eric,Stay still.
corbett,Where's my ELT?
eric,Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
corbett,You got one?
eric,It was blown up with the plane.
corbett,Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
eric,"How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics."
corbett,I'm surprised a flat-ender like you knows cold-weather remedies.
eric, Read a lot of adventure stories when I was a kid...  Corbett smiles.
corbett,I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
eric,An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
corbett,Hate to disappoint you.
anne marie, It's about time...  She hurries back into the Turtle.
viking bob,"Hullo?  He shrugs to the others, then tries the door.  It's unlocked.  Mitchell gets out of the jeep, spits and follows the others in, his hand close to the Colt Peacemaker strapped to his leg.  127  INT.  THE TURTLE  Anne Marie climbs out a window in the back.  She closes it behind her just as Viking Bob pokes his head in the rear module.  The trappers snoop around, noticing that the coffee pot is still warm, etc.  The emptiness is ominous.  LeMalle picks up the big Remington bear rifle.  He opens the breech to determine if it's loaded, and sniffs the barrel to see if"
viking bob,Somebody left in a big hurry.  Check outside.
lemalle, Grizzly sign.  Looks fresh.
mitchell,It's Sam Wilder!
viking bob,"Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this."
mitchell,Where's the kid?
lemalle,Who gives a husky fuck?  Where's Ben?  The trappers look glumly at one another.  130  INT.  UTILITY COMPARTMENT - THE TURTLE  Anne Marie jams herself behind a pile of her photo equipment.  She stops as she hears the trappers' boots  CRUNCH in the snow past her and go inside the Turtle.  131  INT.  THE TURTLE  The trappers peel off their overcoats.  They look around at the comfortable surroundings.
mitchell,I should get me a job with an oil company.  He sits on the couch and lays his scrimshaw and engraving tools out on the coffee table.  LeMalle helps himself in the well-stocked larder.
lemalle,"I say we eat, torch this fuckin' thing, and move on.  LeMalle digs through the cupboards and comes up with a fresh bottle of Scotch."
viking bob,Go easy.
lemalle,Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
lemalle,Big mother musta wanted something real bad in here...
corbett,Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
eric,"Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there."
corbett,"Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money."
eric,"Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things."
corbett,You got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them.  They walk in silence.  Corbett tightens the tarp against the cold air and looks at Eric.
corbett," Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!"
eric,"Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here."
corbett, I've seen plenty like you.  So -more-
eric,"What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible."
corbett,I'm real sad you don't approve of me.  He shoves Eric with his handcuffed hands.
corbett," Tell me what I should do, Professor.  You got all the answers.  I shouldn't hunt? Fine, I'll just phone up and have a salad delivered.  Livid, Eric backs away and knocks Corbett's hands away from him."
eric,Don't push me..!
corbett,"Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.  Eric smashes his fist into Corbett's face.  Corbett reels back, more surprised than hurt.  Eric moves in, furiously throwing punches.  Corbett plows his clenched fists into Eric's midsection, doubling him over.  Gasping, Eric rams his head into Corbett and they fall into the snow.  Despite the handcuffs, Corbett gets a few blows in.  They wrestle fiercely, and Eric ends up on top of Corbett.  He's about to throw another punch when Corbett looks up at him."
corbett," First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind."
neff,Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
kenai,"I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.  139  EXT.  FOOTHILLS ABOVE DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DAY  Exhausted, Corbett and Eric climb across the last set of foothills before the Devil's Cauldron valley.  The town comes into view below them; faintly the MUSIC carries from below.  Corbett looks at Eric and breaks the silence:"
corbett,What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
eric,"They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow."
corbett,Don't bet on it.
eric,I already have.
corbett,You don't know how true that is.  Eric sweeps the snow from between two rocks and sits down.
eric,"We'll wait here until nightfall. No fire, no tarp.  Corbett sits next to him.  After a long moment:"
corbett,"Didn't mean it, you being a coward.  You're a lot of things,  but chickenshit isn't one of them."
eric,"Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all."
corbett,"Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.  No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that -more-"
corbett, Should've been home that day. She'd be getting dressed right about now...  Eric glances over as a look of utter desolation crosses Corbett's face.  140  EXT.  HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE - DAY  The trappers file out the front door.
viking bob,My guess is he's loose and heading for Chukfoktulik.  He'll need supplies; that's the closest settlement without a lawman.  LeMalle carries his booty with him.  Viking Bob looks at him disapprovingly as he puts the big Remington rifle in the jeep.
lemalle,I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
viking bob, What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
lemalle,"Not in the right hands it ain't.  To demonstrate, he rapid-fires several SHOTS from the hip, taking the radio antenna off the roof of the Turtle, shattering panes of glass in an accurate succession, and blasting the door latch off the utility compartment."
lemalle, Thought that door was open last night...
viking bob,"Quit fucking around.  Get in.  LeMalle climbs into the back of the jeep.  With Viking Bob driving, they pull away.  141  EXT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP -   Grinning maliciously, LeMalle hangs the Remington out the window as they retreat.  Taking careful aim, he SHOOTS.  142  EXT.  THE TURTLE  LeMalle's bullet hits the metal fuel tank of the generator. The kerosene fumes EXPLODE, splattering BURNING KEROSENE on the rear module of the Turtle.  The trappers don't slow down to enjoy the show.  Viking Bob hurries on to more important business.  143  INT.  UTILITY COMPARTMENT - THE TURTLE  As soon as the SOUND of the jeep fades away, Anne Marie clambers out of the utility compartment.  Haggard and numb with cold, she helplessly watches as the fire ravenously devours the rear module.  Shielding her face from the flames, Anne Marie reaches under the accordion cover between the modules.  With great effort, she unbolts the coupling bracket.  144  INT.  DIESEL RIG - THE TURTLE  Anne Marie STARTS the engine, SLAMS it into gear, and lurches the front module away from the burning rear module. She shuts the motor off and, trying to hold back the tears, watches the rear module BURNING."
neff,"You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell."
eric,"Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?"
neff,"Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you."
eric,"Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --"
neff,-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
eric,"Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg."
neff,If Corbett's men find out --
eric,"-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow."
neff,Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
eric,"Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight."
neff,I'll go at dawn.
eric,"Thanks.  Don't tell anyone you saw me.  After Eric goes, Neff closes his door and bolts it.  148  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - VARIOUS ANGLES - NIGHT  The temperature dips as the winds shifts and blows down from the north.  Another storm approaches.  The temperate days of last week seem ages ago.  Kenai, Neff, and other TOWNSMEN batten Devil's Cauldron down for the STORM.  Kenai is bundled up in the cold.  The men tighten guy wires on the radio tower, windmills and caches; bring firewood indoors; close off unused rooms in the general store and spa.  Then Neff and Kenai split off from the others.  149  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA  Via a catwalk, Neff and Kenai climb up into the ceiling struts above the partitioned cubicles in the spa to caulk a roof leak with pitch.  Neff is sullen from his conversation with Eric. Kenai, however, is smiling at Neff."
neff,Why the smirk?
kenai,Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
neff,You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
kenai,Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
neff,Stay out of it.
corbett,Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
eric,"You broke the radio, remember?"
corbett, I'm sure she's fine.  Seemed like a clever kid.  Corbett sits up as Eric hands him a plate of beans.
corbett," You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you."
eric,I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
corbett,"You're damn lucky, glimpsing this country before it's ruined, gone for good.  You saw wonders you'd only dreamed of.  That alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from, because you have dreamt them.  Corbett sees he's hit a nerve with Eric."
corbett," Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it?"
eric,"All I want want is you in jail --  A KNOCK at the door interrupts.  Eric lowers the flame on the gas lantern and peers out through a corner of the cardboard in the front window.  Frowning, he cracks the door open and slips outside.  151  EXT.  WILDER'S CABIN  It's Neff and Kenai.  Neff looks guiltily at Eric."
neff, He saw you and Corbett come in...
kenai,Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.  Eric is skeptical of Kenai's concern.
neff,"Don't let him fool you.  Real reason he's here is to buy Corbett's traps.  Eric looks at Kenai, then at Neff.  Neff nods that it's okay.  As extra precaution, Eric handcuffs Corbett's right wrist to the frame of the cot inside the cell."
eric," Okay.  You can talk to him.  But I'll keep the keys with me.  152  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA - NIGHT  Outside the wind HOWLS.  Eric enters and walks into the hallway connecting the bath partitions.  A hand grabs his arm.  Startled, he turns around.  It's Dixie, wearing a threadbare flannel robe."
dixie,"Earl says you get discount. Twenty-five dollar.  Eric shakes his head -- typical Kenai.  He gives her three tens.  She smiles and leads Eric toward the ""infirmary."" It's actually a bath partition outfitted with an examining table and a first-aid kit."
neff," Look, Ben, we don't want any trouble.  The kid's got the key, and besides, he looks edgy enough to use that magnum he's carrying."
corbett,Relax.  I'll get loose in time.
kenai,"Any traps you don't want, I'll pay cash money."
corbett,"Guess someone should use them. Open the bottom drawer in Wilder's desk.  My kit's in there.  Might as well unload everything.  Kenai tugs on the drawer.  It's locked.  Undaunted, he jimmies it open with a knife.  Neff groans.  Kenai goes to throw Corbett the duffel bag, but Neff grabs it.  He checks for weapons, pulling out a hunting knife.  Satisfied, he hands Corbett the bag through the bars.  With his free hand, Corbett digs through his belongings: clothing, freeze-dried provisions, jerky, paperback books. He looks up and shrugs.  154  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA - NIGHT  Eric's ankle is in a resin cast.  His foot rests on a stool. While waiting for the cast to set he soaks in the bathtub, a hot towel draped over his face.  Above him, on a wall bracket, a closed circuit TV plays a war-surplus PORNO FILM.  The door CREAKS open and Dixie comes in.  She impassively checks his cast -- which is interesting, as she's now wearing panties, clog shoes and nothing else.  Eric takes the towel off his face and sits up, astonished."
dixie,"I wash your back for you.  You will like it.  Before Eric can protest, the door OPENS again.  It's Meyerling.  He snaps his fingers at Dixie to shoo her and she scurries away."
meyerling,"I hate to interrupt playtime, but why the hell are you caught up in a local matter when I gave you express instructions to the contrary?!"
eric,"Cut the shit, Leo.  I might need your help...  155  EXT.  CHUKFOKTULIK, ALASKA - NIGHT  Consisting of a handful of sod-roof cabins, mostly bars, Chukfoktulik is a way station in the coniferous forest, sixty miles southeast of Devil's Cauldron.  156  INT.  TRAPPERS' JEEP  With the seats pushed back, LeMalle peels the town's lone WHORE out of her parka.  He's got the motor running for warmth.  Her gold tooth glints in the light from the building next to them.  The locating screen on the beat-up radio beacon receiver bolted to the dash GLOWS phosphorescent green."
whore,"They got nice beds upstairs, honey."
lemalle,"I'm standin' guard duty. Besides, rather spend the room money on sloppy seconds.  Over the sound of LeMalle's exertions there begins an insistent succession of BEEPS.  The Whore looks over LeMalle's shoulder at the locating device."
whore,"Hey, Tiger --  LeMalle turns and immediately loses interest in the Whore. Pushing her off of him, he blows the jeep's HORN three times.  157  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA - NIGHT  Eric and Meyerling are in the middle of an argument."
eric,...I won't let a killer walk!
meyerling,Alleged killer.
eric,What does this matter to you?
meyerling," You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them."
eric,I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
meyerling,"This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World."
eric,"Some day these people'll wake up, and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here.  Eric's attention turns to a rhythmic INTERFERENCE on the TV screen.  There are three short bursts, followed by three long bursts.  Something about it is very familiar. Scowling, he sits up."
eric, Do what you have to.  So will I.  Eric climbs out of the water and pulls his pants on.
lemalle,Northwest.  Devil's Cauldron.  LeMalle dumps the half-naked Whore out onto the snow. Viking Bob starts the jeep and they roar off.  160  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN - NIGHT  Eric shoves Kenai and Neff out the door.
neff,What's wrong?
eric,Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!  He slams the door.  Corbett smiles his Cheshire smile.
eric, Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
corbett,"Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been."
eric,No way they'll find you on a five-minute signal.  And no way -more-
corbett,"They haven't disappointed me yet.  161  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - DAWN  Fat, dry snowflakes pour through the still air.  Gloomy clouds hang immediately overhead.  Visibility is ten feet; the temperature is below zero.  162  INT.  WILDER'S CABIN  It's 5:30 AM.  Sitting at Wilder's desk, Eric pries the tops from some bullets and dumps the gunpowder into a styrofoam cup. He rings the top of the cup with bluetip matches, then seals it with masking tape.  Watching him from the cell, Corbett smiles."
corbett,"Flashbomb, eh?  Eric doesn't answer.  He pulls on a heavy overcoat of Wilder's.  Putting the unused bullets back in Wilder's desk, Eric finds Corbett's .44 magnum.  He puts it and some speedloaders full of .357 hollowpoints in his pockets.  163  EXT. / INT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - MONTAGE  Eric hobbles across town to the hot springs under cover of the early hour and heavy snowfall.  He paces out several circuitous routes from the rental cabins to the airstrip at the edge of town, pausing now and again along the way.  He hears a door SQUEAK open and someone COUGH nearby, so he stands motionless in the snow.  Bundled in wool blankets, Kenai trundles down to his outhouse.  After Kenai passes by, Eric sneaks inside the spa.  He climbs up into the catwalk.  As Kenai goes back to his cabin, he notices that the antique bear traps on display in front of the general store are missing.  Suddenly, Eric grabs him and pulls him into the spa doorway."
eric,I need to rent a cabin.
kenai,What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
eric,"Will you rent me a cabin, or not?"
kenai,"Pretty clever:  If the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time, Sam's is the first place they'll look.  They may figure you're waiting for an airplane, so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip.  Last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town.  I can't afford any trouble --"
eric, -- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
kenai, Why do this?
eric,"If you have to ask, you wouldn't understand."
anne marie,"Eric!  Why aren't you in Fairbanks?  He pulls her away from Neff's doorstep.  Her anger dissolving, she wraps her arms around him."
anne marie," Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse."
eric,You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
anne marie, What's going on?
eric,I'll tell you everything later.
anne marie,Where's Corbett?
eric,"Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over."
anne marie,So what's the problem?
eric,"There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.  Anne Marie grasps the situation with a sickening clarity."
anne marie,Let the people here handle it. It's their marshal Corbett killed!  CUTAWAY - NEFF  has been eavesdropping on the conversation through his window.  The news about Wilder stuns him.  BACK TO SCENE
eric,"Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things."
anne marie,I'm staying.  Eric knows she won't relent.
eric,"Take the snowmobile, park it behind Wilder's cabin.  Sighing, she STARTS the snow machine.  Most of her photo gear is lashed to the saddlebags.  As she pulls away, Eric limps back to Neff's house and knocks on the door. INT.  NEFF'S HOUSE  Shaken, Neff opens the door and lets Eric in."
neff,"I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you."
eric,Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
neff,"I'm the one should be sorry... Goddamn Kenai, always out for a score.  I never should've let him go over there."
eric,I'd sure like that favor you offered a while back.  Neff gets a seasick look on his face.
neff,"Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly."
eric,What are you talking about?
neff,"Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?"
eric,"There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen."
neff,"I'm real sorry.  In a while, you're gone from this country. But we live here.  No one wants to mix it up with those hombres.  Neff opens the door for Eric."
eric, You don't care enough about Sam to --
neff,"-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.  166  EXT.  WILDER'S CABIN  Anne Marie waits in front as Eric hobbles up.  She looks at his bad ankle."
anne marie,You're hurt.
eric,"Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.  He leads her inside."
corbett,"Could've told you no one would help...  Seeing Anne Marie, he smiles."
corbett, Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
eric,Shut up!
corbett,"  Either way, you better clear out. I don't want anyone innocent getting harmed.  This comment has the intended effect on Anne Marie.  Angry, Eric throws Corbett a coat.  Corbett puts it on.  Reaching through the bars, Eric cuffs Corbett's hands together."
eric,"We're moving.  Let's go.  As they exit, Corbett's sardonic look makes Anne Marie shiver.  168  INT.  RENTAL CABIN  The ten-by-ten cabin is furnished with two sagging cots, a beat-up color TV set, a cookstove and a half-drum heat stove.  Built into the rear wall is a rustic dumb waiter that once lowered perishables into the icy waters of a now-dry stream.  Eric checks his watch.  6:15 AM.  He bolts the door and blocks the windows, opening one enough to let sound in from outside.  He extinguishes the Benman lantern and douses the fire in the heat stove so no smoke will emit from the chimney.  Anne Marie slumps into the corner next to the dumb waiter."
eric,You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
viking bob," Ben?  Ben Corbett?  No response.  Carbine held at his hip, Viking Bob walks up to the door and, with a mighty kick, BREAKS it in."
viking bob,"Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars."
lemalle," I'm right fuckin' here with you.  To prove his point, LeMalle trots from dwelling to dwelling, looking through windows and letting himself in through any unlocked door.  This proves fruitless, so he lets out a frustrated YELL.  Pointing the Remington skyward, he lets off a couple thunderous SHOTS that ECHO back off the foothills.  172  INT.  RENTAL CABIN  Hearing the shots, Eric pushes Anne Marie against the floor. Cautioning her to stay put, he crawls to the window and tries to see through the snowfall.  After a moment of silence, from outside, not too far away:"
eric,Answer and I'll shoot!
corbett,"You kill me, you sign your death warrant.  And hers."
lemalle, You hear me?  Ben?
viking bob, Ease off.  We do this my way.  He and the others strain their ears for a clue.
viking bob," Whoever's holding Ben Corbett, listen to me: we just want to know he's okay.  He is, nobody gets hurt.  174  INT.  RENTAL CABIN  His mind racing, Eric stares at Corbett.  Despite the freezing temperature of the room, he's sweating."
corbett,"They know I'm here.  I don't say something, they'll plow this town under.  You willing to accept that responsibility?  Setting his resolve, Eric drags Corbett to the window.  He pushes the barrel of the magnum against Corbett's cheek."
eric,"Say you're okay.  Tell them I'll kill you if they rush us.  Anne Marie bites her lip and tries to maintain a brave front.  Despite the gun in his face, Corbett remains calm."
corbett," Bob?  175  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI  Hearing Corbett's voice, the trappers spin around, trying to ascertain its direction."
viking bob,You in one piece?
viking bob,Count on it.  176  INT.  RENTAL CABIN  Eric pulls Corbett away from the window.  He shoots a look at Anne Marie.  They're in a bind and she knows it.  177  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI  LeMalle grabs Viking Bob's arm.
lemalle," Choose it, asswipe -- cut Corbett loose, or soon as you come outside, I put a fuckin' bullet through your eye!  178  INT.  RENTAL CABIN  Eric glances at Corbett, whose grim look certifies LeMalle's boast."
corbett,"Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away."
eric,Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
corbett,"The time has passed for men like them and me.  I know it.  But they're still fighting for survival, like cornered animals. That's why they'll kill you. -more-"
anne marie," He's right about the snow.  We're blind.  Eric sighs -- is she against him, too?  From outside:"
corbett,"At least your girl had the sense to jump ship.  Too bad she's the only one small enough to fit through that dumb waiter.  179  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - FOLLOW ANNE MARIE  Using the cover of the snowfall, Anne Marie circles around the outside edge of town toward Wilder's cabin.  She takes some of her photo gear from the snowmobile.  180  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI  Unaware of Anne Marie's maneuver, the trappers wait for a response from Corbett.  None comes.  Viking Bob places a calming hand on LeMalle's shoulder."
viking bob,"Just wait, we don't know what this guy's up to.  Ben'll let us know what to do."
eric,Your infrared camera?
anne marie, Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
eric,"I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.  He digs through Anne Marie's bag of equipment and supplies, then stops and looks up.  Outside, there is an OS SOUND that is felt before it is HEARD.  The cargo PLANE approaches in the distance.  185  EXT.  DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI  The trappers look at each other as the SOUND of the plane grows louder."
viking bob,There's what they're waiting on!
mitchell," They'll have to come right past us.  186  EXT.  RENTAL CABIN  Eric quietly pulls the door open.  Holding the pistol to Corbett's head, he pushes Corbett out in front of him.  Anne Marie and Eric exchange a long look.  Fighting back tears, she reaches up and touches his face."
eric,"When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington."
anne marie,"My home is here.  With you.  He smiles.  Then he and Corbett are gone, lost from sight in the snowfall.   After a beat, Anne Marie takes a deep breath and slinks away in the other direction, toward the dance hall."
lemalle, Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
viking bob,"Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.  Stalking, anxious, LeMalle follows Viking Bob."
mitchell," splits off from them and looks for footprints in the snow.  188  EXT.  ALLEY  Eric pushes Corbett through a narrow pass between two buildings in the center of town.  He walks in Corbett's footprints.  Almost through to the other side, he suddenly stops.  Pulling Corbett with him, Eric walks backwards, still carefully placing each foot in an existing footprINT. Corbett can't help but smile.  189  INT.  DANCE HALL  Watching the TV screen, Anne Marie sees one of the red blips change direction and head toward her."
anne marie," One is moving back toward the cabins.  190  EXT.  DANCE HALL  It's LeMalle.  He crosses to Kenai's generator.  With a well-placed rifle SHOT to its innards, he GRINDS it to a halt.  191  INT.  DANCE HALL  The TV PICTURE disappears as the power dies.  Anne Marie keys the PA microphone; it's dead, too.  192  EXT.  ALLEY  Eric and Corbett emerge from between the buildings.  Eric backtracks toward the hot springs spa, now leaving an obvious trail.  193  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA  Eric and Corbett go inside.  Eric pulls the door closed behind them, but leaves it ajar.  194  INT.  KENAI'S HOUSE  The DRONE of the approaching plane is ever louder.  Kenai stands and pulls on a succession of sweaters.  Dixie looks at him."
dixie,"Earl, it's crazy to go out there."
kenai,I hear someone in the spa.
eric, That'll keep him out of the cold.
eric,"He'll live.  202  EXT.  ALLEY  Hearing Viking Bob's cries, Mitchell backtracks and rushes to Viking Bob's aid.  Between them, they manage to yawn open the jaws of the trap and free Viking Bob's leg.  Viking Bob tries to walk but the leg won't support him -- the bone is broken.  Bitterly frustrated, he waves Mitchell on.  In agony, Viking Bob eases down in the snow.  He tears a strip of lining from his coat and wraps his leg to stop the bleeding.  203  EXT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA  Anne Marie scurries by on her way to the airstrip. Suddenly, the hot springs door bursts open and LeMalle lunges at her.  Stripped of his wet clothes, he's wrapped"
anne marie," Don't make me shoot.  She gets up, keeping the magnum pointed shakily toward him. LeMalle glowers menacingly."
anne marie," We're going to Sam's cabin.  You can stay in the jail until this is over.  LeMalle slowly crouches down for his rifle.  Anne Marie wields the handgun at him, but he doesn't stop."
lemalle,"Want to chance it with that hog-leg?  You can't even hold it up.  Better drop me first shot, bitch, or I'll rip your fuckin' lungs out.  Taunting, sneering, LeMalle stares her down.  Anne Marie is paralyzed.  Feeling that he's won, LeMalle wraps his bony fingers around the stock of the Remington.  Anne Marie closes her eyes and FIRES.  Pulling the rifle close, LeMalle tucks and rolls and jumps to his feet.  Anne Marie FIRES again, and AGAIN.  Shot, LeMalle hobbles away, leaving a trail of blood in the snow.  Numb, Anne Marie lets her arm fall.  204  EXT.  BOARDWALK NEAR WILDER'S CABIN  Eric looks around at the sound of the shooting, fearing the worst.  He pulls Corbett off the boardwalk and they cut across open ground toward the airstrip depot.  205  INT.  HOT SPRINGS SPA  Kenai looks around at the messy RESULTS of LeMalle's ransacking for things to wear.  Kenai turns, startled, when he hears footsteps.  It's Neff and Meyerling."
kenai, Lookit this damn mess.  Where in hell's Wilder?
neff, Dead.  Trappers killed him.
kenai,"Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?"
meyerling,"Hey, I thought you people loved Corbett and his wild men!"
kenai,This shoot-'em-up shit is bad for business.  I'm sick of it.
meyerling,"What about you, Neff?"
neff,Well... two of the trappers are down already --
meyerling, -- One left; three of us.  Let's finish it.
neff,What about Eric Desmond?
meyerling,"I'll handle him.  206  EXT.  YARDS BEHIND AIRSTRIP DEPOT  Through the snow, Eric can see the faint outline of the plane on the runway.  He and Corbett hurry toward the back of the airstrip depot.  As they wend their way through the junk-filled yards, Eric catches a glimpse of movement around a corner, REFLECTED in a pane of glass leaning against a roll of tar paper."
lemalle, Over there...  He hoists his Remington.
mitchell, Hold it.  You might hit Ben.
lemalle,Bullshit.  I hit what I'm aiming at.
mitchell,Let 'em come closer first...
mitchell,"Glad to see you're okay.  I told LeMalle not to shoot.  Had some fine seasons, didn't we...  Mitchell's grasp on Corbett's coat relaxes as he dies. Horrified, Eric stares at the man he killed.  Noticing the scrimshaw lying on the snow where it slipped from Mitchell's pocket, Corbett picks it up."
corbett," Fifteen years on the trail with this man, I never saw him rise to anger.  Glaring at Eric, Corbett dips his hand in Mitchell's blood, and suddenly smears it across Eric's mouth.  Repelled, Eric pulls back."
corbett, Your first kill.  How does it taste?
pilot," Circle, this is BMY-955.  I just touched down in Devil's Cauldron. Nobody's here to greet me like usual, and there's gunfire.  I'm getting scarce."
anne marie,You can't leave yet.
pilot,It's my responsibility to get this aircraft out of here safely.  Anne Marie points the .44 at him.
pilot, You got to be kidding.
anne marie,Leave the engines idling.  Go back and open the side door.
meyerling,"Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us."
eric,Fuck you.
meyerling,"This isn't your concern.  It's over, here and now."
corbett," Sure, when you put a bullet in my back on the way out.  Easier for all involved."
meyerling,"Not a bad idea.  Face it, Ben. There's no room in Alaska for you any more.  Meyerling pokes with his foot at a tipped-over rack of Eskimo paraphernalia -- masks, furs, big skin drums, fish- and bear-spears."
meyerling," You're as antiquated as this shit.  Meyerling moves toward Corbett, but Eric stands in his way."
eric,Keep back.
corbett,"You're quite a piece of work, Meyerling.  The tide changes, you ride right along with it.  Eric looks at Neff."
eric,"Neff, you know better than this..."
neff,"You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it."
eric," Anybody moves and I'll shoot!  Holding the .380 on them, Eric crosses to Corbett.  Bleeding from the abdomen, he's trying to stand up."
eric, Can you walk?
