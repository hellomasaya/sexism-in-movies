mother,Can you tell what it is?
suzie,Almost there.
father,It's a junior.
babe brother,Why don't you come in for a while?

junior,I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
harry,Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance. Don't take me wrong but you can't judge people by how you act. You're a caring person.
