kristoff,"What do you want, Sven?"
persi,I can't believe they're finally opening up the gates!
aggie,"And for a whole day! Faster, Persi!"
duke,"Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious trade partner. Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches.  ...Did I just say that out loud?"
irishman,"Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to see the Queen and the Princess. I bet they're absolutely lovely."

anna,...No. 23 FROZEN - J. Lee
duke,"Oh, all right. Hang on. They don't call me the little dipper for nothing.  He dips Anna back. Elsa peeks through the crowd, can barely hold in her laughter. Anna shoots Elsa funny, help-me looks.  DUKE  Like a chicken...with the face of a monkey...I fly.  JUMP CUT TO:"
elsa,"Well, he was sprightly."
anna, Especially for a man in heels.

hans,--your blessing--
anna,--of--
elsa,Marriage...?
anna,Yes!
elsa,"I'm sorry, I'm confused."
anna,"Well, we haven't worked out all the details ourselves. We'll need a few days to plan the ceremony. Of course we'll have soup, roast, and ice cream and then-- Wait. Would we live here?"
elsa,Here? 30 FROZEN - J. Lee
hans,Absolutely!
elsa,Anna--
anna,"Oh, we can invite all twelve of your brothers to stay with us--"
elsa,"What? No, no, no, no, no."
anna,Of course we have the room. I don't know. Some of them must--
elsa,Wait. Slow down. No one's brothers are staying here. No one is getting married.
anna,"Wait, what?"
elsa,"May I talk to you, please. Alone."
anna,"No. Whatever you have to say, you- you can say to both of us."
elsa,Fine. You can't marry a man you just met.
anna,You can if it's true love.
elsa,"Anna, what do you know about true love?"
anna,More than you. All you know is how to shut people out.
elsa,"You asked for my blessing, but my answer is no. Now, excuse me. 31 FROZEN - J. Lee"
hans,"Your Majesty, if I may ease your--"
elsa," No, you may not. And I-I think you should go."

anna," Elsa, please. Please. I can't live like this anymore."
elsa, ...Then leave.
anna, ...What did I ever do to you?!
elsa,"Enough, Anna."
anna,No. Why? Why do you shut me out?! Why do you shut the world out?! What are you so afraid of?!
elsa,"I said, enough! 32 FROZEN - J. Lee"
duke, ...Sorcery. I knew there was something dubious going on here.
anna,Elsa...?
crowd,There she is. Your Majesty! Long live the Queen! Queen Elsa.... Come drink with us.

hans,...Are you all right?
anna, No.
hans,Did you know?
anna,No.
duke,Look! It's snowing! It's snowing! The Queen has cursed this land! She must be stopped!  You have to go after her.
anna,"Wait, no!"
duke,"You! Is there sorcery in you, too? Are you a monster, too?"
anna,No. No. I'm completely ordinary.
hans,That's right she is...  ...in the best way.
anna,...And my sister's not a monster.
duke,She nearly killed me.
hans,You slipped on ice.
duke,Her ice! 35 FROZEN - J. Lee
anna,It was an accident. She was scared. She didn't mean it. She didn't mean any of this.... Tonight was my fault. I pushed her. So I'm the one that needs to go after her.
duke,Yes. Fine. Do.
hans,What?
anna," Bring me my horse, please."
hans,"Anna, no. It's too dangerous."
anna,"Elsa's not dangerous. I'll bring her back, and I'll make this right."
hans,I'm coming with you.
anna,"No, I need you here to take care of Arendelle."
hans,...On my honor.
anna, I leave Prince Hans in charge!
hans, Are you sure you can trust her? I don't want you getting hurt.
anna,She's my sister; she would never hurt me. 36 FROZEN - J. Lee
elsa,"THE SNOW GLOWS WHITE ON THE MOUNTAIN TONIGHT, NOT A FOOTPRINT TO BE SEEN. A KINGDOM OF ISOLATION AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'M THE QUEEN."
anna," Elsa! Elsa! It's me, Anna...your sister who didn't mean to make you freeze the summer. I'm sorry. It's all my f-f-f-f-f-f-fault."
anna,"Snow, it had to be snow, she couldn't have had tr-tr-tropical magic that covered the f-f-fjords in white sand and warm --  She sees smoke rising up in the distance.  ANNA  Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold..."
anna,Wandering Oaken's Trading Post.
anna,"Oh, great. For now, how about boots. Winter boots...and dresses? 40 FROZEN - J. Lee"
oaken, That would be in our winter department.
anna,"Oh. Um, I was just wondering; has another young woman, the Queen perhaps, I don't know, passed through here?"
oaken,"Only one crazy enough to be out in this storm is you, dear?"
kristoff, Carrots.
anna,Huh?
kristoff,Behind you.
anna,"Oh, right. Excuse me."
oaken," A real howler in July, yah? Where ever could it be coming from?"
kristoff,The North Mountain. 41 FROZEN - J. Lee
anna, North Mountain.
oaken,That'll be forty.
kristoff,"Forty? No, ten."
oaken," Oh dear, that's no good. See these are from our winter stock, where supply and demand have a big problem."
kristoff,You want to talk about a supply and demand problem? I sell ice for a living.
anna,"Ooh, that's a rough business to be in right now. I mean, that is really...  Ahem. That's unfortunate."
oaken,"Still forty. But I will throw in a visit to Oaken's sauna. Hoo hoo! Hi, family."
naked family,Hoo hoo!
kristoff,...Ten's all I got. Help me out.
oaken, Ten will get you this and no more.
anna,"Okay, just tell me one thing; what was happening on the North Mountain? Did it seem magical?"
kristoff,"Yes! Now, back up while I deal with this crook here."
oaken,What did you call me?
kristoff,"Okay. Okay, I'm- Ow! Whoa!"
oaken,Bye bye.
kristoff,"No Sven, I didn't get your carrots."
oaken," I'm sorry about this violence. I will add a quart of lutefisk, so we'll have good feelings. Just the outfit and boots, yah? 43 FROZEN - J. Lee"
kristoff,"REINDEERS ARE BETTER THAN PEOPLE. SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?"
anna,Nice duet.
kristoff,"Oh, it's just you. What do you want?"
anna,I want you to take me up the North Mountain. 44 FROZEN - J. Lee
kristoff,I don't take people places.
anna,Let me rephrase that...
kristoff,Umph.
anna,Take me up the North Mountain.... Please.
kristoff,We leave at dawn.... And you forgot the carrots for Sven.
anna,Oops. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't--  We leave now. Right now.
kristoff, Hang on! We like to go fast!
anna, I like fast!
kristoff,"Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down."
anna," Ew. No, I was raised in a castle."
kristoff,"So tell me, what made the Queen go all ice-crazy?"
anna,"...Oh well, it was all my fault. I got engaged but then she freaked out because I'd only just met him, you know, that day. And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage--"
kristoff,Wait. You got engaged to someone you just met?
anna,"Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she got mad and then she tried to walk away, and I grabbed her glove--"
kristoff,Hang on. You mean to tell me you got engaged to someone you just met?! 46 FROZEN - J. Lee
anna,"Yes. Pay attention. But the thing is she wore the gloves all the time, so I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt."
kristoff,Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?
anna,"Yes, they did.... But Hans is not a stranger."
kristoff,Oh yeah? What's his last name?
anna,...Of-the-Southern-Isles?
kristoff,What's his favorite food?
anna,...Sandwiches.
kristoff,Best friend's name?
anna,Probably John.
kristoff,Eye color.
anna,Dreamy.
kristoff,Foot size...?
anna,Foot size doesn't matter.
kristoff,Have you had a meal with him yet? What if you hate the way he eats? What if you hate the way he picks his nose?
anna,Picks his nose? 47 FROZEN - J. Lee
kristoff,And eats it.
anna,"Excuse me, sir. He's a prince."
kristoff,All men do it.
anna,Ew. Look it doesn't matter; it's true love.
kristoff,Doesn't sound like true love.
anna,Are you some sort of love expert?
kristoff,No. But I have friends who are.
anna,You have friends who are love experts.... I'm not buying it.
kristoff, Stop talking.
anna,"No, no, no. I'd like to meet these--"
kristoff,I mean it. SHHH.
anna,What are they?
kristoff,Wolves. 48 FROZEN - J. Lee
anna,Wolves. What do we do?
kristoff,I've got this. You just...don't fall off and don't get eaten.
anna,But I wanna help.
kristoff,No.
anna,Why not?
kristoff,Because I don't trust your judgement.
anna,Excuse me?!
kristoff,Who marries a man she just met?
anna,It's true love!
kristoff, Whoa.
anna,Christopher!
kristoff,It's Kristoff! 49 FROZEN - J. Lee
anna,Duck!
kristoff,You almost set me on fire!
anna,But I didn't.
kristoff,You don't tell him what to do!
kristoff,"Of course I don't want to help her anymore. In fact, this whole thing has ruined me for helping anyone ever again."
anna," I mean, sure. I'll let you tag along."
anna,Arendelle.
kristoff,It's completely frozen.
anna,...But it'll be fine. Elsa will thaw it.
kristoff,Will she? 52 FROZEN - J. Lee
anna, ...Yeah. Now come on. This way to the North Mountain?
kristoff,More like this way.
anna,I never knew winter could be so beautiful.
kristoff,You're creepy.
anna,I don't want it!
kristoff,Backatchya!
olaf,Please don't drop me.
anna,Don't!
kristoff,"Come on, it's just a head."
anna,No!
anna,"Ew, ew, the body!"
olaf,"Wait, what am I looking at right now? Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?"
anna, ...Okay. Wait one second.
olaf,Oooh! Thank you!
anna,You're welcome.
olaf,Now I'm perfect.
anna,"Well, almost."
olaf,Woo! Head rush!
anna,"Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry! I-I, I was just.... Are you okay?"
olaf,Are you kidding me? I am wonderful! I've always wanted a nose.  So cute. It's like a little baby unicorn.
anna,"Olaf?...That's right, Olaf. 55 FROZEN - J. Lee"
olaf,...And you are?
anna,"Oh, um...I'm Anna."
olaf,And who's the funky-looking donkey over there?
anna,That's Sven.
olaf,Uh-huh. And who's the reindeer?
anna,...Sven.
olaf,"Oh. They're--oh, okay....  Makes things easier for me."
anna,"Olaf, did Elsa build you?"
olaf,Yeah. Why?
anna,Do you know where she is?
kristoff, Fascinating...
olaf,Yeah. Why? 56 FROZEN - J. Lee
anna,Do you think you could show us the way?
olaf,Yeah. Why?
kristoff, How does this work?
olaf,"Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus here.  Yeah, why?"
kristoff,I'll tell you why. We need Elsa to bring back summer.
olaf," Oh, I don't know why but I've always loved the idea of summer, and sun, and all things hot."
kristoff,Really? I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.
olaf,Nope. But sometimes I like to close my eyes and imagine what it'd be like when summer does come.
olaf,BEES'LL BUZZ / KIDS'LL BLOW DANDELION FUZZ / AND I'LL BE DOING WHATEVER SNOW DOES IN SUMMER. 57 FROZEN - J. Lee
kristoff,I'm gonna tell him.
anna,Don't you dare.
olaf,IN SUMMER!
anna, I'm coming!
kristoff,Somebody's got to tell him.
dissolve to:,59 FROZEN - J. Lee
citizen one,No. No. You've got the bark facing down. The bark needs to be face-up.
citizen two,Bark down is drier.
citizen one,Bark up.
citizen two,Bark down.
citizen one,Bark up.
hans,Cloak. Does anyone need a cloak?
gerda,"Arendelle is indebted to you, Your Highness."
hans,The castle is open. There's soup and hot glgg in the Great Hall.
duke,"Prince Hans, are we just expected to sit here and freeze while you give away all of Arendelle's tradable goods?"
hans, Princess Anna has given her orders and-- 60 FROZEN - J. Lee
duke,And that's another thing; has it dawned on you that your princess may be conspiring with a wicked sorceress to destroy us all?
hans,"Do not question the Princess. She left me in charge, and I will not hesitate to protect Arendelle from treason."
duke, Treason?!
hans,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy."
crowd, Princess Anna's horse. What happened to her? Where is she?
hans,...Princess Anna is in trouble.  I need volunteers to go with me to find her!
duke,"I volunteer two men, my Lord!  Be prepared for anything, and should you encounter the Queen, you are to put an end to this winter. Do you understand?"
cut to:,61 FROZEN - J. Lee
kristoff,So how exactly are you planning to stop this weather?
anna," Oh, I am gonna talk to my sister."
kristoff,That's your plan? My ice business is riding on you talking to your sister.
anna,Yup.
kristoff,So you're not at all afraid of her?
anna,Why would I be?
olaf," Yeah. I bet Elsa's the nicest, gentlest, warmest person ever."
anna,What now? 62 FROZEN - J. Lee
kristoff,"...It's too steep. I've only got one rope, and you don't know how to climb mountains."
kristoff, What are you doing?
anna, ...I'm going to see my sister.
kristoff,You're going to kill yourself.
kristoff,Or there. How do you know Elsa even wants to see you?
kristoff,"You know, most people who disappear into the mountains want to be alone."
kristoff,"I'm not alone.... I have friends, remember?"
anna,You mean the love experts?
kristoff,"Yes, the love experts!"
anna,...Please tell me I'm almost there.
kristoff,Hang on.
olaf,"Hey, Sven? Not sure if this is going to solve the problem, but I found a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go."
anna,Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch!
anna,Whoa.
kristoff, Now that's ice. I might cry. 64 FROZEN - J. Lee
anna,Go ahead. I won't judge.
kristoff,"All right, take it easy. I gotcha."
olaf,...Knock....  Why isn't she knocking...? Do you think she knows how to knock?
anna,Ha. It opened. That's a first.
kristoff,What?
anna,"Last time I introduced her to a guy, she froze everything."
kristoff,"But, it's a palace made of ice. Ice is my life. 65 FROZEN - J. Lee"
olaf,"Bye, Sven."
anna,"You too, Olaf."
olaf,Me?
anna,Just give us a minute.
olaf,Okay.
anna,Elsa? It's me...Anna?!
anna,"Elsa, you look different.... It's a good different.... And this place is amazing. 66 FROZEN - J. Lee"
elsa," Thank you, I never knew what I was capable of."
anna,...I'm so sorry about what happened. If I'd known--
elsa," No, it's okay. You don't have to apologize.... But you should probably go, please."
anna,But I just got here.
elsa,...You belong in Arendelle.
anna,So do you.
elsa,"No, I belong here. Alone. Where I can be who I am without hurting anybody."
anna,"...Actually, about that--"
elsa,Wait. What is that?
olaf,"Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs."
elsa, Olaf?
olaf, You built me. You remember that?
elsa, And you're alive?
olaf,Um...I think so?
anna,He's just like the one we built as kids.... We were so close. We can be like that again.
young elsa,Anna!
elsa,"No, we can't."
anna,"Elsa, wait--"
elsa, I'm just trying to protect you.
anna,You don't have to protect me. I'm not afraid. Please don't shut me out again. 68 FROZEN - J. Lee
elsa,"Anna, PLEASE GO BACK HOME. YOUR LIFE AWAITS. GO ENJOY THE SUN AND OPEN UP THE GATES."
anna,"Yeah, but--"
elsa,"I know! YOU MEAN WELL, BUT LEAVE ME BE. YES, I'M ALONE BUT I'M ALONE AND FREE."
anna,"ACTUALLY, WE'RE NOT."
elsa,WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT? 69 FROZEN - J. Lee
anna,I GET THE FEELING YOU DON'T KNOW?
elsa,WHAT DO I NOT KNOW?
anna,ARENDELLE'S IN DEEP DEEP DEEP DEEP SNOW.
elsa,What?
anna,You kind of set off an eternal winter...everywhere.
elsa,Everywhere?
anna,"It's okay, you can just unfreeze it."
elsa,"No, I can't. I don't know how."
anna,Sure you can. I know you can.
elsa, I'M SUCH A FOOL! I CAN'T BE FREE!
anna,YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID.
elsa,NO ESCAPE FROM THE STORM INSIDE OF ME!
anna,WE CAN WORK THIS OUT TOGETHER. 70 FROZEN - J. Lee

elsa,YOU'RE NOT SAFE HERE!
anna,WE CAN FACE THIS THING TOGETHER...
elsa,NO!
elsa,I CAN'T!
kristoff,Anna. Are you okay? 71 FROZEN - J. Lee
anna,I'm okay.... I'm fine.
elsa," Who's this? Wait, it doesn't matter. You have to go."
anna,"No, I know we can figure this out together--"
elsa, How? What power do you have to stop this winter? To stop me?
kristoff,"Anna, I think we should go."
anna," No. I'm not leaving without you, Elsa."
elsa," Yes, you are."
anna,Stop. Put us down!
olaf, You are a lot stronger than I think you realize.
marshmallow, Go away!
anna,Olaf!
olaf,Watch out for my butt!
anna,It is not nice to throw people!

kristoff,This way!
anna,I got him!
kristoff,"Whoa, stop!"
anna,It's a hundred foot drop.
kristoff,It's two hundred.
anna,Ow.
kristoff,I'm digging a snow anchor. 74 FROZEN - J. Lee
anna, Okay. What if we fall?
kristoff,There's twenty feet of fresh powder down there; it'll be like landing on a pillow.... Hopefully.

kristoff,Don't talk to him like that.
anna, Whoa!
kristoff,You okay?
anna,Thank you.
kristoff, Ah! Ooh!
olaf,I don't have a skull.... Or bones.
kristoff,...So....
anna, Now what?! Oh! What am I gonna do? She threw me out. I can't go back to Arendelle with the weather like this. And then there's your ice business--
kristoff,"Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice business...  Worry about your hair?!"
anna,What? I just fell off a cliff. You should see your hair.
kristoff,"No, yours is turning white."
anna,White? It's what?
kristoff,It's because she struck you; isn't it?
anna,Does it look bad?
kristoff, ...No.
olaf,You hesitated.
kristoff,"No, I didn't. Anna, you need help. Now, come on. 79 FROZEN - J. Lee"
olaf,Okay! Where are we going?
kristoff,To see my friends.
anna, The love experts?
olaf,Love experts?!
kristoff,Yes. And don't worry; they'll be able to fix this.
anna,How do you know?
kristoff,...Because I've seen them do it before.
olaf,I like to consider myself a love expert.
elsa, Get it together. Control it. Don't feel. Don't feel. Don't FEEL!

olaf,"Look, Sven. The sky's awake."
kristoff,Are you cold?
anna,...A little.
kristoff,Wait. Come here.
anna,Oooh.... That's nice.
kristoff," So, about my friends...well, I say friends, they're more like family.... Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven...until they took me in."
anna, They did?
kristoff, 81 FROZEN - J. Lee
anna,"Kristoff, they sound wonderful."
kristoff,Okay then....
anna, ...They're rocks.
olaf, Why aren't you running?
anna,Okay. Um...I'm gonna go--
bulda,KRISTOFF'S HOME!
olaf, Kristoff's home.
troll one,"Oh, lemme look at you!"
troll two,"Oh, take off your clothes, Kristoff; I wash them."
kristoff," Ah! No. I'm gonna keep my clothes on, thank you."
anna,Trolls? They're trolls.
bulda,...He's brought a girl!
anna,What's going on?
kristoff,I've learned to just roll with it.
bulda,"Let me see. Bright eyes. Working nose. Strong teeth. Yes, yes, yes. She'll do nicely for our Kristoff."
anna,Wait. Oh. Um. No.
kristoff,You've got the wrong idea. That's not why I brought her here.
anna,Right. We're not. I'm not--
bulda," What's the issue, dear? Why are you holding back from such a man?"
kristoff,"Can we just stop talking about this?! We've got a real, actual problem here."
bulda,I'll say--  IS IT THE WAY THAT HE RUNS SCARED?
kid troll,OR THAT HE ONLY LIKES TO TINKLE IN THE WOODS?
kristoff,"No, I don't."
trolls,"HIS ISOLATION IS CONFIRMATION OF HIS DESPERATION FOR HEALING HUGS. SO HE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, BUT WE KNOW WHAT TO DO. THE WAY TO FIX UP THIS FIXER UPPER IS TO FIX HIM UP WITH YOU."
kristoff, Enough! She's engaged to someone else. Okay?!
kid troll,"AND BY THE WAY, I DON'T SEE NO RING."
girl trolls,WE AREN'T SAYING YOU CAN CHANGE HIM
all trolls,"EVERYONE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT FATHER, SISTER, BROTHER WE NEED EACH OTHER TO RAISE US UP AND ROUND US OUT"
trolls,"EVERYONE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER, BUT WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE- THE ONLY FIXER UPPER FIXER THAT CAN FIX A FIXER UPPER IS TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE LOVE"
troll priest,"Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be your trollfully wedded--"
anna,"Wait, what?!"
troll priest,You're getting married.
trolls,LOVE!
kristoff,Anna?
grand pabbie,There's strange magic here!
kristoff,Grand Pabbie!
grand pabbie,"Bring her to me, Kristoff."
anna,What...? No.
kristoff,"So remove it, Grand Pabbie."
grand pabbie,"I can't. If it was her head, that would be easy. But only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart."
anna,An act of true love?
bulda," A true love's kiss, perhaps?"
kristoff,"Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans."
anna, ...Hans. 88 FROZEN - J. Lee
kristoff,"Help us out, Sven."
olaf,I'm coming! Let's go kiss Hans! Who is this Hans?!
hans,"We are here to find Princess Anna. Be on guard, but no harm is to come to the Queen. Do you understand?"
marshmallow,Go away!
duke's thug,The Queen.
elsa, No. Please.
thug,Get her! Get her!
hans,"Queen Elsa! Don't be the monster they fear you are.  Elsa snaps out of her rage. She sees the men, frightened, moments from death. She stops. Elsa looks to Hans, overwhelmed, frightened.  The wall retreats from the thug on the balcony. The ice spikes lower from the second thug's neck. He takes advantage and aims his crossbow at Elsa's back.  Seeing it. Hans runs and pushes the crossbow up just as the arrow releases. The arrow hits the ice chandelier, hanging directly above Elsa.  The chandelier comes CRASHING DOWN.  Elsa dives out of the way but she falls in the blast.  All we see is ice smashing like glass, and all we hear is the sound of it shattering as it rings out.  CUT TO BLACK."
elsa,No....What have I done?
hans,I couldn't just let them kill you. 91 FROZEN - J. Lee
elsa,But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get Anna.
hans,Anna has not returned....
elsa,Don't you see...I can't.
hans,I will do what I can.
kristoff,"Just hang in there.  Come on, buddy, faster!"
olaf,I'll meet you guys at the castle! 92 FROZEN - J. Lee
kristoff,"Stay out of sight, Olaf!"
olaf,I will!
guard,It's Princess Anna!
kristoff,I've got you.
anna,...Are you g-gonna be okay?
kristoff, Don't worry about me.
gerda,"Anna! Oh, you had us worried sick."
kai,My Lady. You are freezing.
gerda,"You poor girl, you're freezing. Let's get you inside. 93 FROZEN - J. Lee"
kristoff,"Get her warm and find Prince Hans, immediately."
kai,We will. Thank you.
kristoff,Make sure she's safe!
hans,I'm going back out to look for Princess Anna.
french dignitary,You cannot risk going out there again.
hans,If anything happens to her--
spanish dignitary,"If anything happens to the Princess, you are all Arendelle has left."
kai,He's in here. Prince Hans.
hans,Anna. 94 FROZEN - J. Lee
anna," Hans, you have to kiss me."
hans,What?
anna,Now. Here we go.
gerda,We'll give you two some privacy.
hans,What happened out there?
anna,Elsa struck me with her powers.
hans,You said she'd never hurt you.
anna,I was wrong.
hans,Anna.
anna, She froze my heart and only an act of true love can save me.
hans, A true love's kiss.
anna,What?
hans,"As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I knew I'd have to marry into the throne somewhere--"
anna,What are you talking about?
hans," As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course. But no one was getting anywhere with her. But you-"
anna,Hans?
hans,"You were so desperate for love you were willing to marry me, just like that."
anna,"Hans. No, stop. 96 FROZEN - J. Lee"
hans,"But then she doomed herself, and you were dumb enough to go after her."
anna,Please.
hans, All that's left now is to kill Elsa and bring back summer.
anna,...You're no match for Elsa.
hans,"No, you're no match for Elsa. I, on the other hand, am the hero who is going to save Arendelle from destruction."
anna, You won't get away with this.
hans,"Oh, I already have."
anna," Please, somebody help."

duke,"It's getting colder by the minute. If we don't do something soon, we'll all freeze to death."
spanish dignitary,Prince Hans.
hans,Princess Anna is...dead.
various dignitaries,What...? No.... Mon dieu.
duke,What happened to her?
hans,She was killed by Queen Elsa.
duke,Her own sister.
hans, At least we got to say our marriage vows...before she died in my arms.
duke,There can be no doubt now; Queen Elsa is a monster and we are all in grave danger.
spanish dignitary,"Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to you."
hans,"With a heavy heart, I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason and sentence her to death."
kristoff,"What is it, buddy?"
anna, Help.
olaf,Anna. Oh no.
anna,Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there.
olaf,Whoa! So this is heat....  I love it.
anna,I was wrong about him. It wasn't true love.
olaf, Huh. But we ran all the way here?
anna,"Please Olaf, you can't stay here; you'll melt."
olaf,I am not leaving here until we find some other act of true love to save you.
anna,I don't even know what love is.
olaf," That's okay, I do...."
anna,...Kristoff loves me?
olaf,"Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you?"
anna,"Olaf, you're melting."
olaf, Some people are worth melting for.
anna,...They-they are? 102 FROZEN - J. Lee
olaf,"Wow, he's really moving fast. Huh.... I guess I was wrong. I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind."
anna,"Help me up, Olaf. Please."
olaf,"No, no, no, no, no. You need to stay by the fire and keep warm."
anna,I need to get to Kristoff.
olaf," Oh, oh, oh, I know why."
olaf,We're trapped.
olaf,"Slide, Anna."
kristoff,"Come on, buddy, faster."
anna,Kristoff!
olaf,"Keep going, Anna!"
anna,Kristoff!

hans,Elsa. You can't run from this!
elsa,...Just take care of my sister.
hans,Your sister? She returned from the mountain weak and cold. She said you froze her heart.
elsa,What? No.
hans,"I tried to save her, but it was too late. Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white..."
anna, Kristoff.
kristoff,Anna.
anna,Elsa.
elsa,Anna!
olaf, Anna?
elsa,Wha-? Anna?
anna,"Oh, Elsa."
elsa,...You sacrificed yourself for me?
anna, ...I love you.
olaf,An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart.
elsa, Love.... Of course.
anna,Elsa?
elsa,Love.
anna,I knew you could do it.
olaf," Hands down, this is the best day of my life...and quite possibly the last."
elsa,"Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy. 108 FROZEN - J. Lee"
olaf,"Hey, my own personal flurry."
anna,Uh. Uh. Uh.
hans, Anna? But she froze your heart.
anna,The only frozen heart around here is yours.
hans,"Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
french dignitary, I will return this scoundrel to his country. We shall see what his twelve big brothers think of his behavior.
kai,"Arendelle thanks you, my Lord. 109 FROZEN - J. Lee"
duke,This is unacceptable. I am innocent. I'm a victim of fear. I've been traumatized.  Ow! My neck hurts. Is there a doctor I could...No? And I demand to see the Queen!
kai,I have a message from the Queen.  Arendelle will henceforth and forever no longer do business of any sort with Weaseltown.
duke,Weselton. It's Weselton!
anna,Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!
kristoff,Pole.
anna,Oops. Sorry.
anna, Okay. Okay. Here we are. 110 FROZEN - J. Lee
kristoff, Are you serious?
anna,Yes. And it's the latest model.
kristoff,No. I can't accept this...
anna,You have to. No returns. No exchanges. Queen's orders. She's named you the official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.
kristoff,What? That's not a thing.
anna,Sure it is. And it even has a cup holder.... Do you like it?
kristoff,Like it?
anna,We may. 111 FROZEN - J. Lee
elsa,Are you ready?
anna,I like the open gates.
elsa,We are never closing them again.
anna,"What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful, but you know I don't ska--"
kristoff,Look out. Reindeer coming through! 112 FROZEN - J. Lee
olaf,That's it. Glide and pivot and glide and pivot.
