all, I WISH...  4
florinda lucinda," WHAT, YOU WISH TO GO TO THE"
jack's mother,What in heaven's name are you doing with the cow inside the house?
jack,I thought if he was nice and warm he might produce some milk.
jack's mother,It's a she! How many times must I tell you? Only shes can give milk!
baker,"Hey! The BAKER swiftly comes around the counter where a small, plump young girl in a red cape, LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD studies the goodies."
stepsisters,"Yes, Mother. They sweep out of the room giggling. BACK ON CINDERELLA. She stands forlornly, studying the mess that awaits her. She closes her eyes and begins to gently sway as if going into a trance."
jack,"Bullseye! JACK'S MOTHER was just exiting the house. The CUP falls down, narrowly missing her."
jack's mother,What are you doing? Stop your pretending! She grabs JACK'S sling and pulls him away from the COW.
jack,"Mother, no-- he's the best cow in the"
jack's mother,Was. She's been dry for weeks. We've no food or money and no choice but to sell her.
jack,But Milky-White is my best friend!
jack's mother,Look at her!
wife,"You're certain of your way? As LRRH sings, she begins to help herself to all the buns she can lay her hands on."
baker,"I don't suppose you're planning on buying any of these? The WIFE gives the BAKER a look, then hands LRRH a basket."
wife,"Now, don't stray and be late!"
baker,And you might save some of those sweets for Granny.
lucinda,(pointing to her
florinda,I know.
lucinda,She means me.
florinda,"No, she didn't! The two STEPSISTERS bicker as CINDERELLA brushes and twists their hair into tight curls:"
florinda,"Tighter! CINDERELLA obliges and becomes more aggressive with the hair styling, her emotions building as she thinks to herself:"
florinda,Ow! Not that tight! Clod! She reels around and smacks CINDERELLA who stands stunned. The STEPSISTERS giggle and snort.
baker,Who might that be?
wife,We have no bread.
witch,I don't want your bread.
baker,Then what is it you wish?
witch,It's not what I wish. It's what you wish. She moves towards the WIFE as the BAKER tries unsuccessfully to protect her. She points her gross finger towards her belly.
wife,What curse?
witch,The one I placed on this house!
baker,What are you talking about?
witch,"In the past, when you were no more than a babe, your father brought his young wife and you to this cottage. They were a lovely couple. But not lovely neighbors. You see, your mother was with child and she developed an unusual appetite. She admired my beautiful garden and she told your father that what she wanted, more than anything in the world was--"
witch's pov,"In the moonlight, we see the BAKER'S FATHER, wearing a hunting jacket, scale over the WITCH'S wall and into her garden. From behind a wooden trellis, she WATCHES him as he gathers her greens:"
witch," AND/ RIPPING UP THE RAMPION/   IN RETURN, HOWEVER,/ I SAID, ""FAIR IS  FAIR:/ YOU CAN LET ME HAVE THE BABY/  THAT YOUR WIFE WILL BEAR,  13"
baker,I had a brother?
witch,No. But you had a sister.
baker,Where is she?
witch,"She's mine now and you'll never find her! Small price to pay for what else your father stole from me. It cost me my youth, my beauty. My mother warned me she would punish me with the curse of ugliness if I ever lost them."
wife,Lost what?
baker,How could you do that to me?
witch,"And when your mother died, your father deserted you. Your father was no father -- so why should you be?"
baker, I'm so sorry...
jack,Why do I have to go to the next village?
jack's mother,Because everyone in this village knows the cow hasn't given a drop of milk in weeks.
jack,But that's cheating.
jack's mother,"We're starving, Jack. Don't you understand that? You're not to take less than five pounds for her. Are you listening to me?"
jack's mother,How much are you to ask?
jack,No more than five pounds. She grabs his ear and squeezes it hard.
stepmother,Ladies. Our carriage awaits! CINDERELLA darts out of the house holding out the bowl of lentils to her STEPMOTHER.
stepmother,"The Festival! DARLING, THOSE NAILS!/"
cinderella,The festival lasts three nights. Surely you can let me be there for one of them.
stepmother,The King is trying to find his son a wife -- not a scullery maid! We must be gone!
wife,Here. Take this...
baker,I'm not wearing that.
wife,Why?
baker,It was my father's. You heard what she said. This is all his fault. The BAKER throws the jacket to the ground.
wife,Look! She picks them up.
wife,I can help you.
baker,No. I can do this on my own.
baker wife," THE SPELL IS ON MY HOUSE./ NO, NO, THE SPELL IS ON OUR  ONLY I CAN LIFT THE SPELL,/ HOUSE./ WE MUST LIFT THE  THE SPELL IS ON MY HOUSE. SPELL TOGETHER,/ THE SPELL IS  ON OUR HOUSE."
wife,You don't remember?!
wife cinderella, I KNOW -- I'LL VISIT MOTHER'S
wife,(giving him a little
c's mother,"What is it that you wish, child? CINDERELLA looks up to see her MOTHER in the tree."
another angle,"The wind now blowing the willow tree, its LEAVES begin to rain down on CINDERELLA, turning gold and silver as they swirl around her, transforming her clothes into a beautiful gown. CINDERELLA looks down to see that she is now wearing a pair of shoes literally made of gold leaf. When she looks back up, the tree has now returned to its former shape."
cinderella,"Thank you, Mother. She dashes into the woods."
wolf's pov,"Branches and leaves rush by in a blur. Suddenly, the CAMERA stops, and in the distance we see LRRH strolling down a path of exotic flowers as she munches on a treat. We hear HEAVY BREATHING. The CAMERA continues stalking its prey, moving closer towards LRRH through the brush. ANGLE on LRRH, as she continues walking and eating."
lrrh,"Good day, Mr. Wolf."
wolf,Whither away so hurriedly?
lrrh,To my Grandmother's.
wolf,And what might be in your basket?
lrrh,It's bread for Grandmother so she'll have something good to make her strong.
wolf,And where might your Grandmother live?
wolf,"Goodbye, little girl./ AND HELLO... The WOLF climbs to the top of a precipice where he is silhouetted by the red hot sun. He lets out a mighty howl."
witch,Why are you standing there?! Go get the cape!
baker,You frightened me! The WITCH swings to the ground.
witch,Get it! Get it! Get it!
baker,How am I supposed to get it?
witch,"You go up to the little thing, and you take it."
baker,I can't just take a cloak from a little girl. Why don't you take it!
witch,"It's the rules. Why do you think I asked you in the first place? I'm not allowed to touch any of the objects! We suddenly hear the lilting sound of a young voice singing in the distance. The WITCH, almost intoxicated by her sound, swoons with delight. Then:"
baker,"This is ridiculous! ANOTHER ANGLE. LRRH is picking flowers off the path, blithely unaware of anything else. The BAKER gets up and hurries over to her."
lrrh,"Hello, Mr. Baker."
baker,Have you saved some of those sweets for Granny?
lrrh,I ate all the sweets and half the loaf of bread.
baker,So I see! Now tell me...where did you get that beautiful cape?
lrrh,My Granny made it for me.
baker,Is that right? I would love a red cape like that.
baker,May I take a look at it? He quickly unties it.
lrrh,No!
baker,I need it badly.
lrrh,"Please -- give it back! They have a tug of war. The BAKER pulls free and runs off with the cape. LRRH stands there momentarily stunned, then lets out a loud scream. ANGLE ON THE BAKER. He stops cold, realizing what he's done, then runs back to LRRH and places the cape around her shoulders."
baker,I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure that you really loved this cape. Now off you go to Granny's -- and be careful that no wolf comes your way.
lrrh,I would rather a wolf than you any day. LRRH stamps on his foot. The BAKER hops on his good foot.
baker,What are you doing here? The WIFE steps out from behind a thicket.
wife,You forgot your scarf.
baker,You shouldn't be here. It's not safe in these woods!
wife,I want to help. She goes to tie the WOOL SCARF around his neck but he pulls away.
baker,No! THE SPELL IS ON MY HOUSE--
both,"... milk. The WIFE pushes the BAKER in JACK'S direction, then follows."
baker,"Hello there, young lad."
jack,"Hello, sir."
baker,What might you be doing with a cow in the middle of the forest?
jack,I was heading toward market -- but I seem to have lost my way.
baker,And what are you planning to do there?
jack,"Sell my cow, sir. No less than five pounds."
baker,Five pounds!
wife,She must be generous of milk to fetch five pounds?
wife,And if you can't fetch that sum? Then what are you to do?
jack,I hadn't thought of that...
wife," Beans? We mustn't give up our beans! Well, if you feel we must..."
baker,Huh?
jack,Beans in exchange for my cow?
wife,"Oh, these are no ordinary beans, son. These beans carry...magic."
jack,Magic? What kind of magic?
baker,Magic that defies description.
jack,How many beans?
baker,Six.
wife,Five!
jack,Could I buy my cow back someday?
wife,Yes.
baker,"...possibly. Here. He hands JACK the five beans, carefully dropping them one at a time into the boy's hand. The WIFE quickly takes the SIXTH BEAN and puts it in her pocket."
jack,"One day, I'll buy you back -- Promise! JACK kisses the cow. The BAKER looks to his WIFE guiltily. Overcome with emotion, JACK runs back into the woods."
baker,Take the cow and go home!
wife,I was just trying to help.
baker,Magic beans! We've no reason to believe they're magic! Are we going to dispel this curse through deceit?
wife,No one would have given him more for this creature. We did him a favor. At least they'll have some food.
baker,Five beans?!
wife,Do we want a child or not?
baker,Of course. But...
wife,We have one chance. Don't you see that? And if we fail...
baker,I'm just not sure I'm cut out to be a father.
wife,Why do you say that?
baker,Because of my father.
wife,You're not him.
baker,I don't know...
wife,"If you can't do this for yourself, can't you at least do it for me?"
baker,All right. You take the cow and go home. I'll find the rest of the things. On my own. The BAKER walks away.
witch,"Rapunzel. Rapunzel. Let down your hair to me. The PRINCE, hiding within the brush."
r's prince,Rapunzel... The PRINCE dashes back to his horse and gallops off. The WITCH arrives at the window.
witch,"Don't you look lovely today, my dear."
rapunzel,"Thank you, Mother."
witch,"I brought your favorite. Blackberries, fresh from the garden."
lrrh,"Oh dear, how uneasy I feel. Perhaps it's all the sweets."
lrrh,Granny?
wolf," Come in, my deary. LRRH moves towards the bed with trepidation and slowly pulls back the curtain. The WOLF is revealed, lying under the covers, dressed in GRANNY'S nightcap and robe."
lrrh,"My, Grandmother. You're looking very strange. What big ears you have!"
wolf,"The better to hear you with, my dear. The handsome WOLF flashes a smile that reveals a set of gleaming white FANGS."
baker,I can't believe I just did that. LRRH and GRANNY appear at the doorway behind him.
granny,Aren't you going to help us skin that beast?
baker,No thanks!
granny,What kind of hunter are you?
baker,I'm a baker.
lrrh,Wait a minute. I never thanked you.
baker,"You need to be more careful, young lady."
lrrh,I'm sorry. I should have known better.
baker,Are you certain?
lrrh,Yes. Maybe Granny will make me another with the skins of the wolf.
baker,"Thank you. Thank you! Impulsively he gives her a kiss on the cheek and as he leaves, the girl wipes it off."
lrrh,Yuck!
jack,But they're magic -- the man said --
jack's mother,Get your head out of the clouds! She angrily THROWS the beans to the ground.
jack,"Mother -- no! She turns to grab JACK'S ear, failing to see the electric sparks that flare when the beans strike the ground."
jack's mother,"You and your worthless adventures! Will you never learn, Jack?! To bed without supper for you! She storms away. JACK lies on his bed bereft. He sees his sling on the floor and picks it up cradling it as he closes his eyes. THE CAMERA travels to a hole in the wall and looks below to see five bean stalks already growing and intertwining, quickly reaching skyward."
c's prince,I must find that girl!
wife,"Are you alright, miss?"
wife,"What a beautiful gown you're wearing. Were you at the King's Festival? CINDERELLA, preoccupied, collects herself so she can continue on her way."
cinderella,Yes.
wife,Aren't you the lucky one. Why ever are you in the woods at this hour? We hear the PRINCE'S ENTOURAGE approaching.
cinderella,"Please. Don't let them know I'm here. She quickly hides herself in the brush. The WIFE turns around and looks to the top of the rise to see C-PRINCE on a black stallion, with his STEWARD and ATTENDANTS in tow. He calls down to the WIFE."
c's prince,Have you seen a beautiful young woman in a ball gown pass through?
wife,(Breathless as she
wife,I've never lied to royalty before. I've never anything to royalty before!
cinderella,Thank you.
wife,"If a prince were looking for me, I certainly wouldn't hide."
cinderella,"Well, what brings you here -- and with a cow?"
wife,"Oh, my husband's somewhere in the woods."
wife,"Oh, yes. But tell me, the Prince, what was he like?"
wife,But why would you run away?
cinderella,It's not quite what I expected.
wife,"Princes, castles, gowns..."
cinderella,I have no experience with those things. We hear the far off CHIMES OF MIDNIGHT from the castle.
wife,But you will return to the Festival tomorrow eve?
cinderella,Yes... No... I don't know...
wife,You don't know? What I wouldn't give to be in your shoes. (looking to her
cinderella,I must get home. CINDERELLA runs off.
wife,Wait! I need your shoes! The WIFE goes after CINDERELLA but then hears a distant COW MOAN. She turns around to discover that MILKY-WHITE has taken off.
witch,One midnight gone!
wife,Already?!
witch,Get that cow! The WIFE takes off after the cow as the CAMERA RISES above tree level. The BLUE SHADOW has moved a little further across the face of the MOON.
jack,"Good fortune! Good fortune, sir! Look what I have! Five gold pieces."
baker,A giant?
jack,Let's go find them! JACK grabs the BAKER and excitedly tries to pull him along.
baker,Wait a minute! I'm not sure I want to sell.
jack,But you said I could buy her back. Do you want more money?
baker,"No, no, no! It's not that--"
baker,"Wait. I didn't say-- But JACK doesn't wait to listen. Taking the EMPTY SACK, he runs off excitedly."
baker,What are you doing here?
wife,Well... She doesn't want to tell him she's lost MILKY-WHITE.
baker,Yes. I've got the cape. Only two items left.
baker,Two. We've the cape and the cow.
baker,What have you done with the cow?!
wife,She ran away. I never reached home. I've been looking for her all night.
wife,She might just as easily have run from you!
baker,But she didn't!
baker,We were just going to do that. Here. He climbs towards her with the cape.
baker,I don't like that woman.
wife,I'm sorry I lost the cow.
baker,I shouldn't have yelled.  Go back to the village. I will make things right. And then we can just go about our life. No more witches or dim- witted boys or hungry little girls. The BAKER'S WIFE starts to speak.
r's prince,Good brother. I was wondering where you'd gone.
c's prince,I have been looking all night for her.
r's prince,Her?
c's prince,The beautiful one I danced the evening with.
r's prince,Where did she go?
c's prince,"Disappeared, like the fine morning mist."
r's prince,She was lovely?
c's prince,The loveliest. They dismount and walk their horses through the forest.
r's prince,"I am not certain of that! I must confess, I too have found a lovely maiden. She lives here in the woods."
r's prince,Yes! In the top of a tall tower that has no door or stairs.
c's prince,Where?
r's prince,"Two leagues from here, due east, just beyond the mossy knoll near the rose thickets."
c's prince,And how do you manage a visit?
r's prince,"I stand beneath her tower and say, ""Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair to me."" And then she lowers the longest, most beautiful head of hair - yellow as corn - which I climb. The WIFE is thrilled by this news, and runs off."
c's prince,"Rapunzel, Rapunzel! What kind of name is that? You jest! I have never heard of such a thing."
r's prince,I speak the truth! She is as true as your maiden. A maiden running from a prince? None would run from us.
c's prince,Yet one has. The PRINCES lead their horses to a stream that cascades into a magnificent waterfall.
wife,"Rapunzel, Rapunzel? Let your hair down to me. The window at the top of the tower opens and RAPUNZEL sticks out her head looking downward. The WIFE hides to the side."
wife, Who is she? Where did she go?  49
c's prince,"Don't play the fool, woman!"
wife,I was trying to hold her here for you...
c's prince,"I can capture my own damsel, thank you."
wife,"Yes, of course. The STEWARD returns, covered in burrs and looking none too happy."
steward,"No sign of her, my liege."
c's prince,"Well, what are you waiting for? See if you can find her. The STEWARD rides off. The PRINCE pauses. The ultimate seducer, he gives the WIFE the once over."
baker,Moo... Moo...... He HEARS sounds off in the distance.
baker's pov,"The STEPFAMILY'S carriage is passing through a large hollowed opening in the base of a huge tree. We can hear the STEPSISTERS bickering, their blonde hair bobbing animatedly."
another angle,"The BAKER stands in the middle of the pathway, flagging down the carriage. He pulls an ear of corn from his satchel. As the carriage slows, he hops on the sideboard."
stepmother,"Mongrel!  Carry on! She pushes the BAKER off the carriage and he somersaults backwards into the brush. The CARRIAGE speeds off. Deflated, the BAKER picks himself off the path and sits on what he thinks is a white rock. There is a muffled ""Moo..."" He jumps up realizing he's been SITTING on the cow."
baker,"Milky-White! He hears something and hides behind a BUSH. Then, seeing it is his WIFE, he steps out."
wife,Oh! It's you! And you've the cow! She runs to MILKY-WHITE.
wife,Three.
baker,Two.
wife,Three! She shows him the braid of hair around her neck.
baker,Where did you find it?
baker,Three!
wife,"And I almost had the fourth, but she got away."
baker,We've one entire day left. Surely we can locate the slipper by then.
wife,We? You mean you're going to let me stay with you?
baker,Well...perhaps it will take the two of us to have this child.
baker,Where did you get this?
jack,From the Giant's hen! The BAKER'S WIFE examines the egg.
wife,A golden egg! I've never seen a golden egg.
jack,And you can have it. Along with the five gold pieces.
wife,Five gold pieces?
jack,Now I'm taking my cow. JACK moves to MILKY-WHITE. The distant CHIMES OF MIDNIGHT begin to ring out from the castle.
wife baker,"You took five gold pieces?! I didn't take, you gave."
wife,Where are the five gold pieces?
jack,You said I could have my cow!
baker wife,Now I never said you could. I You would take money before a said you might. child?!
baker,"No, no, no - it's not how it sounds!"
rapunzel,"No, no, please!"
rapunzel,No!
rapunzel,No!
rapunzel,No!
rapunzel,I'm no longer a child. I wish to see the world.
rapunzel,No!
witch,Your prince will never lay eyes on you again. He will never lay eyes on anything again!
rapunzel,What did you do to him?
witch,"It doesn't matter because where you're going, no one will ever see you again. The WITCH lunges at RAPUNZEL with a pair of SHEARS and begins to hack off her hair. The girl lets out a mighty shriek."
jack,"Hey there - nice cape! The figure twists around, pulling a knife."
lrrh,Stay away from my cape or I'll slash you into a thousand bits!
jack,Whoa! I don't want it.
lrrh,My Granny made it for me from a wolf that attacked us. And she gave me this beautiful knife for protection.
jack,"Well, look what I have! A golden egg. He shows her his GOLDEN EGG."
jack, I stole a hen that lays golden eggs from the kingdom of the Giant.
lrrh,I don't believe you.
jack,It's true. And you should see the Giant's toy harp. It plays the most beautiful tunes without your even having to touch it.
jack,I could.
lrrh,You could not!
jack,I could!
lrrh,"You could not, Mr. Liar!"
jack,I am not a liar! I'll get that harp. You'll see! He runs off.
baker,We've only one day left! I don't know where to start.
wife,You can start by buying a new cow with the money you took from the boy.
baker,"Right, where do I buy a cow?"
wife,"You go to the next village, you'll find a cow there."
baker,What are you going to do?
wife,I'm going to get the slipper.
baker,The yellow slipper?
wife,The GOLDEN slipper!
baker,"Yes. The golden slipper, that's what I meant. How are you going to get it?"
wife,I have met a maiden with golden slippers these two previous nights.
baker,You think you could get one?
wife,"Yes, I'm sure of it. I'll meet you back here."
baker,Right.
wife,Because we have to if we're going to be together... The BAKER and his WIFE start to go off in opposite directions when there is a TREMENDOUS CRASH with the force of an earthquake. The BAKER and his WIFE are knocked off their feet and tumble into a bank of FERNS. They scramble to their feet and look to one another.
cinderella," HE'S A VERY SMART PRINCE,/ HE'S A  PRINCE WHO PREPARES./ KNOWING THIS  TIME I'D RUN FROM HIM,/ HE SPREAD  PITCH ON THE STAIRS./ AND I'M CAUGHT  UNAWARES./ WELL, IT MEANS THAT HE  CARES--/ THIS IS MORE THAN JUST  MALICE./ BETTER STOP AND TAKE STOCK/  WHILE YOU'RE STANDING HERE STUCK/ ON  THE STEPS OF THE PALACE.  ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU WANT?/ HAVE TO  MAKE A DECISION./ WHY NOT STAY AND BE  CAUGHT?/ SHOULD I GIVE THAT A  THOUGHT,/ WHAT WOULD BE HIS RESPONSE?/ She turns around to see the PRINCE, frozen in time and staring at her.  CINDERELLA   60"
c's prince,The ball is over. Send everyone home.
steward,And the Princess?
c's prince,She won't get far with one shoe.
cinderella,Don't come any closer to me!
wife,"Please, stop! Just hear me out!"
cinderella,You have attacked me once before.
wife,"I didn't attack you. I attacked your shoe. I need it. I have a magic bean in exchange for it. Breathless, CINDERELLA stops. Stands defensively. The WIFE pulls out the bean from her pocket and hands it to her."
cinderella,"Magic bean? Nonsense! CINDERELLA tosses it over her shoulder, but they don't see the SPARKS it sets off when it hits the ground and sinks into the earth. She starts to leave."
wife,"Wait, please. I haven't much time!"
cinderella,That makes no sense!
wife,Does it make sense that you're running from a prince? The STEWARD approaches on HORSEBACK.
cinderella,I must go!
wife,(starts to take off a
wife,Thank you! Thank you! CINDERELLA dashes off.
wife,It's mine.
steward, Lying will cost you your life! The STEWARD snatches the shoe. The WIFE pushes the Steward and grabs the slipper back.
steward,You will pay for this!  62
wife,"Please give me the slipper, kind Prince, and all will come to a happy end."
c's prince,"Do as she says, Steward. We only need one."
steward,Oh... He hands the slipper back to the WIFE. The STEWARD gets onto his horse.
wife, Thank you. Thank you!
c's prince,"This very night! The PRINCE, STEWARD and RETINUE ride off, leaving the WIFE alone. She looks up to the moon and hurries off. We follow the WIFE'S feet as she scurries past the beginnings of a BEANSTALK CURLING UPWARDS from the ground."
steward,Let it be known that his Royal Highness the Crown Prince will be visiting every house in this village tonight.
stepmother,"It's a perfect fit, Your Highness! LUCINDA winks at the PRINCE flirtatiously, then promptly faints to the ground with a thud. The shoe falls from her foot. The PRINCE nods to the STEWARD who walks over and gingerly picks up the bloody slipper."
c's prince,Have you no other daughters?
stepmother,"Only a little stunted kitchen wench, which her late father left behind but she cannot present herself. She is too dirty. Out of the shadows, CINDERELLA appears. The STEWARD hands the slipper to the Prince, who kneels down in front of CINDERELLA and easily slips it on her foot."
c's prince,"I would recognize these beautiful eyes anywhere. This is the true bride! The PRINCE sweeps CINDERELLA off her feet and leads her to his horse. The two of them ride off. FLORINDA and LUCINDA watch, not at all happy. Then they hear a CAWING  overhead. They look up, alarmed. BIRD'S POV. Far below, FLORINDA and LUCINDA cower together, dreading what is to come as the CAMERA rushes towards them."
r's prince,Rapunzel? Rapunzel?
rapunzel,"My darling! She jumps into the swamp, fearlessly ignoring the SNAKES, until she reaches terra firma and her man. R-PRINCE falls from his horse onto the ground."
r's prince,"Rapunzel? Is it you? RAPUNZEL reaches him and rips off his scarf. She kneels to cradle his face, weeping."
rapunzel,How could she do this to you? EXTREME CLOSE-UP: RAPUNZEL'S TEAR falls into the R-PRINCE'S blind eye. The PRINCE'S vision is restored.
rapunzel,What?
r's prince,"I can see you! The two of them embrace. At the same time, we hear MOOING."
baker," Come on! We don't have any time... Then the WIFE rushes in from another direction, carrying the"
wife,I've found you!  You've got the cow!
baker,You've got the slipper!
wife,We've all four! They hug with delight but are quickly startled by the WITCH who appears in the hollow of a tree.
witch,I see a cow. I see a slipper.
baker,And the cape as red as blood.
wife,And the hair as yellow as corn.
baker,We've done it!
wife,We've got them all. But suddenly the WITCH is suspicious.
witch,Wait a minute!
wife,Of course she is. A desperate glance at the BAKER. He couldn't have screwed this up -- could he?
witch,This cow has been covered with flour!
wife, What? You didn't get a real white cow? The BAKER turns to the WITCH.
baker,We had a cow as white as milk. Honestly we did.
witch,Then where is she?
wife,She's dead.
baker,And we thought you'd prefer a live cow.
witch,Of course I'd prefer a live cow! So show me the dead cow and I'll bring her back to life!
jack's mother,Jack! There you are! I've been worried sick about you! There's a dead giant in our backyard!
jack,There is?
jack's mother,You know there is. You could have been crushed!
jack,"But Mother, look. The most beautiful harp."
wife,We're running out of time!
baker,It's here...
jack,What's happening?
baker,She's going to bring Milky-White back to life.
baker,She's a witch! She can do anything!
jack,Wow!
witch,"Stand back! They quickly move away, and the WITCH invokes some unintelligible incantation, and with the wave of her cape, the DEAD COW comes back to life, shaking off the leaves. JACK races over to her."
jack,"Milky-White. You're back! I missed you so much! The BAKER looks up at the MOON...only a slither left, the rest covered by SHADOW."
baker,It's almost midnight!
witch,Quiet! Feed the objects to the cow.
wife,What?
witch,You heard me! Feed them to the cow! The WIFE and BAKER walk towards the COW and begin feeding it a portion of the ingredients. Not an easy chew for the animal. The WITCH hands them a silver chalice.
jack,"I'll do it. She'll only milk for me. JACK begins milking the cow, the others watching intently, but alas, nothing is coming out."
witch,Wrong ingredients. Forget about a child!
wife,"Wait! We followed your instructions. One, the cow is as white as milk. Correct?"
witch,Yes.
wife,"And two, the cape was certainly as red as blood."
witch,Yes.
wife,"And three, the slipper--"
witch,Yes.
baker,"And four, I compared the hair with this ear of corn."
wife,I pulled it from a maiden in a tower
witch,You what?! What were you doing there?
wife,"Well, nothing. I happened to be"
witch,I touched that hair! I told you! I cannot have touched the ingredients!
jack,The corn! The corn!
baker,What? JACK grabs the ear of corn out of the BAKER'S hand.
jack,You can use the silky hair of the corn--
witch,"Yes! Pull it from the ear and feed it to the cow. Quickly! The BAKER grabs the ear of corn from JACK, pulls the hair from the corn and feeds it to the cow. JACK begins milking the cow again. We hear the distant CHIMES OF MIDNIGHT begin. Light pours from above bathing them in a growing haze of BLUE LIGHT as the SHADOW finally eclipses the MOON. The COW lets out a BLOODCURDLING MOAN."
wife,It's working!
jack,She's milking! The WITCH grabs the chalice.
witch,"At last! The WITCH drinks the potion. She begins to shake. Blue smoke begins to pour from her and swirl about as if she is trapped inside a cloud. The WIFE lets out a shriek.. The BAKER looks at his WIFE, her belly begins to grow to nine- months-full of pregnancy."
baker,"That was quick! The cloud that has surrounded the WITCH now engulfs the area until a brisk wind blows it away, revealing a beautiful woman standing in the BLUE LIGHT of the FULL MOON. The WITCH has been restored to her former self, and she likes what she sees. The final CHIME OF MIDNIGHT is joined by every other BELL IN THE KINGDOM -- a joyous cacophony as we:"
wife," Thanks for the slipper. The carriage arrives at the entrance to the castle. As the PRINCE and CINDERELLA step from their carriage they are met by cheers. The STEPFAMILY awaits the married couple. The beaming STEPMOTHER with her DAUGHTERS who are now wearing dark glasses, holding canes and looking rather glum. RAPUNZEL stands with her PRINCE. The CROWD ROARS as CINDERELLA and her PRINCE wave. The STEWARD takes up a large speaking trumpet and the CROWD quiets."
steward,"Let us cheer the newlyweds as they embark on their happy bliss today, and"
jack's mother,Jack? Jack...? ANGLE ON BAKER and his WIFE.
wife,I think so.
baker,And the baby?
wife,"Yes, he's fine. There is another AFTERSHOCK. ANGLE ON RAPUNZEL. She is spooked by the commotion and runs off through the crowd and disappears."
steward,(speaking into the
c's prince,"There's no need for worry. It was an earthquake in a far-off quadrant of our kingdom. Nothing to fear at all. As many of you know, we had another little shaker just days ago. I will personally investigate the disturbance. Now everyone, back to your villages, and on with your lives!"
wife,"What's happened? Everything's so different. They discover LRRH sitting on her suitcase in what was once a lush area, now trampled and broken."
baker,"Hello, little one. Are you alright? What are you doing here? With a suitcase?"
lrrh,I'm moving in with Granny. Our whole village collapsed. I couldn't find my mother anywhere. And now I can't find my Granny's cottage.
baker,What do you mean?
lrrh,"I went down the dell, and I didn't recognize anything. There was no path.  Where's the stream? Where's the bridge? Where's Granny?"
wife,Calm down.
baker,We can help you find Granny's without the path.
wife,Yes. The WIFE is exhausted. She hands the BABY to the BAKER.
baker,Why does he always cry when I hold him?
wife,You needn't hold him as if he was so fragile. The BABY wails. The BAKER hands the bundle back.
baker,He doesn't want me. He wants his mother!
wife,I can't take care of him all of the time.
baker,I'll take care of him -- when he's older... They hear COMMOTION in the distance.
wife,Who might that be?
baker,It's the Steward and the royal family.
baker,What brings you into the woods?
steward,The castle has been destroyed.
wife,No!
stepmother,The kingdom is under attack.
baker,What is the Royal family going to do?
steward,I have no idea! I don't make policy. I just carry it out.
wife, I think it best we get back to the village. We'll take the girl with us. She holds out a hand for LRRH.
baker,A giant woman! Through the trees we see the furious face of a female GIANT. We never see her in her entirety -- but the volume of her voice matches her size.
giant,Where is the lad who killed my husband?
steward,There is no lad here!
baker,"We haven't seen him. The WITCH, who has slipped in behind the group, comes forward startling everyone and moves directly to the GIANT."
witch,We'll get him for you right away. Don't move! LRRH races past the WITCH and brandishes her knife.
lrrh,It was you who destroyed our house - not an earthquake.
giant,And who destroyed my house? I want him! A great bellow that makes the trees shake. The WITCH moves towards the STEPSISTERS.
witch,Would you like a blind girl instead?
stepmother,"How dare you? She wants the boy! And then JACK'S MOTHER arrives. Innocently, she asks the worst question possible."
jack's mother,Jack! Has anyone seen my Jack? He ran off again and I've been... Everyone stares at her. JACK'S MOTHER does a slow take looking up and discovering the GIANT.
steward, She's looking for him too.
giant,Give him to me! The GIANT suddenly reaches down. They all quickly duck out of the way. JACK'S MOTHER runs forward to confront the GIANT.
jack's mother,Jack is just a lad! We had no food to eat so he sold his beloved cow in exchange for magic beans.
giant,The boy - I want the boy!
jack's mother,You leave my boy alone!
giant,You're making me very angry! The GIANT stomps her foot in anger.
steward,"Don't make her angry, woman, or you'll get us all killed! But JACK'S MOTHER is in full flow, facing up to the GIANT."
steward,Stop!
baker,Don't upset the Giant!
jack's mother,"You big bully! I'll hide my son and you'll never find him. You'll never, ever..."
steward,Get back woman! The STEWARD forcefully pulls JACK'S MOTHER behind him. She trips and falls.
stepmother,"Yes, that's true."
florinda lucinda,Yes. The steeple tower. We saw him there!
giant,"If he is not, I will return tonight and find you! All of you! The GIANT takes off, the power of her footsteps forcing everyone to hold on to one another for safety. The BAKER'S WIFE sees JACK'S MOTHER, who is still lying on the ground. She goes to her."
wife,Look! What have you done to her?
steward,"I didn't mean to hurt her. I was just thinking of the greater good. The BAKER steps forward, taking charge."
baker,Listen everyone. If we're going to get through this we have to stick together.
witch,Not always. The STEPFAMILY leaves.
lrrh,What are we going to do now?
witch,We have no choice. Find the boy and give her what she wants.
lrrh,"But if we do, she'll kill Jack."
witch,And if we don't she'll kill half the kingdom! She rushes back into the woods.
jack's mother,Promise me you won't let them get Jack. Promise!
baker,"Okay, I promise."
witch,Rapunzel! You're safe! Thank goodness.
rapunzel,Who are you?
witch,Surely you remember?
witch,"This is who I truly am, my dear. Now you don't have to be embarrassed by me. You must come with me. There's a Giant in the land. She moves towards RAPUNZEL -- but suddenly the R-PRINCE rides up on his white steed. He jumps off and rushes to RAPUNZEL."
r's prince,My darling. Are you all right? Why did you run off?
rapunzel,I was afraid.
witch,She's not going with you!
rapunzel,I will not come with you!
witch,Then you leave me no choice. The WITCH pulls RAPUNZEL behind her and tries to cast a spell on R'S PRINCE. Nothing. She tries again. Still nothing. The PRINCE takes notice of the Witch.
r's prince,You! The one who blinded me.
rapunzel,...and then banished me to an island -- in the middle of a swamp!
witch,I was just trying to be a good mother!
witch,"Rapunzel, no! You will never be safe with him."
rapunzel,Take me away from here. R-PRINCE pulls RAPUNZEL up onto his horse.
witch,No! Rapunzel!
rapunzel,Don't you understand? I never want to see you again. Ever! ANGLE ON THE WITCH watching RAPUNZEL ride into the woods.
baker,We're never going to find him.
wife,We should fan out. It'll increase our chances.
baker,No. You can't be on your own.
wife,I'll be all right.
baker,What if we get lost?
wife,We'll count our steps from right here.
lrrh,"I'll go, too."
wife,No. You stay with the baby. The WIFE hands LRRH the baby and sits her down.
baker, You would leave our son with her?
wife,Yes. He's asleep. He'll be safe with the girl.
wife,See?
baker,But what if the Giant comes back...
wife,"What if, what if! Five hundred paces. Go! The WIFE turns and starts walking."
baker,Wait! Take this. It might be cold.
wife,One eighty-one...one eighty-two... one eighty-three... one eighty-four... (looks up; startled;
c's prince,Hello.
wife,You must be here to slay the Giant.
c's prince,The Giant?
wife,Yes. Surely you've heard there is a giant in our midst.
c's prince,Of course. A giant.
wife,"Yes, it's a lady giant. Unusual, huh?"
c's prince,I should think. And why are you alone in the woods?
wife,I came with my husband. We were ... well you see ... it's a long story.
c's prince,He would let you roam alone in the woods?
wife,"No, actually it was my choice."
c's prince,How brave.
wife,Brave?
c's prince,Yes./ ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THE
c's prince,"Well, yes, I do."
wife,And I have a...baker.
c's prince,"Of course, you're right. How foolish./"
baker,Four eighty two... four eighty three...
cinderella,"The tree has fallen. Mother's grave, destroyed."
cinderella,I shouldn't complain. I'm sure others have suffered worse after the earthquake.
baker,Earthquake? It's no earthquake -- there's a giant terrorizing the kingdom!
cinderella,"Well, I'm sure the Prince will see to it that the Giant is rid from our land."
baker,"Hah, the Prince? No doubt he's off somewhere seducing some young maiden."
cinderella, What?
baker,"You look just like the Princess -- but dirty. Oh no, you are the Princess! He drops to his knees and bows."
cinderella,Please. Please... Get up! I'm not a princess here.
baker,I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you.
cinderella,I had to disguise myself. I'm not permitted to leave the palace unescorted. CINDERELLA looks away towards the wreckage of her mother's grave.
baker,"If you'd like you can come with me. You will be safe in our company. CINDERELLA thinks for a moment, then nods."
cinderella,Thank you.
baker,This way.
c's prince,I must leave you. She looks at him confused. He walks over to his horse and mounts it.
wife,What was that?/ WAS THAT ME?/ WAS THAT
baker,She should be back by now.
lrrh,She wouldn't get lost.
cinderella,I'm sure she'll return.
baker,"No, I must go and look for her-- They hear a commotion. It's the WITCH, who has JACK by the scruff of the neck."
witch,Look who I found!
jack,You're hurting me! The WITCH continues pulling the boy along.
baker,Let go of him!
witch,I'll let go of him when I give him to the Giant.
jack,Make her stop!
lrrh,"Leave him alone! LRRH goes to try and pull JACK away from the WITCH. A tussle ensues, and the BAKER notices that JACK has dropped something. He goes over and picks up his SCARF."
baker,(at the top of his
jack,"I'm sorry, sir..."
baker,It's my wife's!
jack,I'm sorry. I came upon her. She was at the bottom of a cliff...
baker,What are you saying? JACK can't say the words.
cinderella,How awful...
baker,No. No...! As the truth sinks in.
witch,"Wake up! When you're dead, you're dead.  Now it's time to get this boy to the Giant before we're all-- CINDERELLA and LRRH block her way."
cinderella,Keep away from him.
lrrh,No!
witch,This is no time to be soft-hearted! He's going to the Giant and I'm taking him. The BAKER grabs hold of JACK.
baker,Yes! He's the one to blame! It's because of you there's a giant in our midst and my wife is dead!
cinderella baker,"  IF YOU HADN'T DARED HIM TO-- AND YOU HAD LEFT THE HARP  ALONE,/  WE WOULDN'T BE IN TROUBLE/ IN  THE FIRST PLACE!"
cinderella," LRRH   WELL, IF SHE HADN'T RAISED  WELL, IF YOU HADN'T THROWN  THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE--!  AWAY THE BEAN/ IN THE FIRST  PLACE--!/ IT WAS YOUR FAULT!"
jack," YES, IF YOU HADN'T RAISED THEM IN THE  FIRST PLACE--! They turn to the WITCH who has her back to them.  LRRH/BAKER CINDERELLA  RIGHT! IT'S YOU WHO RAISED YOU RAISED THE BEANS IN THE  THE BEANS IN THE FIRST PLACE-- FIRST PLACE!  !"
witch,Shhhhhhh!
witch,No?/ YOU'RE SO NICE./ YOU'RE NOT
jack,Maybe I shouldn't have stolen from the Giant...
lrrh,Maybe I shouldn't have strayed from the path...
cinderella,Maybe I shouldn't have attended the Ball...
jack,Where are you going?
baker,Away from here.
lrrh,But you said we had to find our way out of this together.
baker,It doesn't matter whether we're together or apart.
jack,We need your help.
baker,You don't understand. My wife was the one who helped. I depended on her for everything.
cinderella,You would leave your child?
cinderella,But wait...
baker,What are you doing here?
baker's father,I'm sorry. I did a foolish thing.
baker,Why would you do that? Why did you take the Witch's beans?
baker's father,They were there and I wanted them. I didn't think. I was being careless --
baker,-- Selfish.
baker,"You stole them and you were caught, and then you did what you do. You just ran away."
baker's father,"When your mother died, I was... I hated myself and I ran from my guilt and my shame..."
baker,... and your son.
baker's father,"Yes, and my son. And I'm sorry for that."
baker,"If you're looking for forgiveness, you're not going to get it."
baker's father,I never expected...
baker,Then what do you want?
baker's father,Aren't you making the same mistake? The BAKER says nothing.
jack,If there were just some way we could surprise the Giant.
lrrh,She's too tall to surprise. They look up as a newly determined BAKER returns.
cinderella,I knew you wouldn't give up.
jack,He wouldn't leave his baby.
lrrh,It looked like he was going to.
baker,Give me my son. The BAKER takes the BABY. The baby begins to cry.
lrrh,What are we going to do now?
baker,We need to rid this kingdom of the Giant -- together.
jack cinderella,What? No!
cinderella,The birds can help!
lrrh,You can talk to birds?
cinderella,The birds will do their part.
baker,"Okay, we don't have much time."
jack,I'm excited.
baker,Here's what we're going to do... The BAKER leads them away from the tar pit.
cinderella,Your father's being very brave. We're going to be very brave too. The C-PRINCE is passing a nearby path on horseback. He stops when he sees CINDERELLA.
cinderella, The Giant went in that direction. He rides closer.
c's prince,My darling!
cinderella,"I'm well aware of that. He comes and puts his arm around her, but she pulls away."
c's prince,My love. What is it?
cinderella,Maybe I'm not your only love.
cinderella,"If you love me, why did you stray?"
c's prince,"I thought if you were mine, that I would never wish for more."
cinderella,"If this is how you behave as a prince, what kind of king will you be?"
c's prince,"I was raised to be charming, not sincere."
cinderella,I think you should go.
c's prince,I'm not going to leave you.
cinderella,Consider that I've been lost. A victim of the Giant.
c's prince,Is that what you really wish?
cinderella,"My father's house was a nightmare. Your house was a dream. Now I want something in-between. She takes off her wedding ring and gives it back to him. He stands there for a moment, then mounts his horse."
c's prince,I shall always love the maiden who ran away.
cinderella,And I the faraway prince. The PRINCE rides off.
baker,"Careful, there. Not so fast."
jack,"You needn't worry -- this is easier than a beanstalk. ANGLE ON CINDERELLA. She's sitting on a tree stump, rocking the baby. LRRH returns."
lrrh,They're in the tree -- over there. We made slings out of my cape. LRRH sits next to CINDERELLA.
cinderella,I'm glad you're here to help me. LRRH turns her head away.
lrrh,I think my mother and my Granny would be upset with me.
cinderella,Why?
lrrh,They said always to make them proud and here I am about to kill somebody.
cinderella,Not somebody. A giant who's done a lot of harm.
lrrh,But a giant's a person. Aren't we to show forgiveness?
cinderella,I know.
jack,Wait until my mother hears I've slain the Giant.
baker,"Jack, there's something you have to know. Your mother..."
jack,What?
baker,She didn't make it.
jack,Was she killed by the Giant?
baker,"No. It wasn't like that. She was fighting with the Giant, trying to protect you, and she was pushed by the Steward -- and -- she fell."
jack,The Steward will pay for this.
baker,"No, Jack --"
jack,"After we slay the Giant, I will slay him."
baker,You'll do nothing of the kind.
jack,What he done was wrong. He should be punished.
baker,It's not as easy as that.
lrrh,Here she comes!
baker,"Go, Jack! Be careful."
wide shot,The GIANT approaches LRRH and CINDERELLA.
giant,Where is the boy?
lrrh,We have him.
giant,Where?
jack,Here I am! The GIANT begins to move aggressively towards JACK. JACK and the BAKER load their slings.
baker, Ready?
jack,"Ready! ANGLE on the GIANT'S feet, trampling everything in her path. Suddenly, she steps into the expanse of the tar pit, which slowly stops her in her tracks. She fights to free herself as she begins to sink."
cinderella,Good birds!
lrrh,She doesn't look happy. -- the BAKER and JACK use their slings to fire stones at the
cinderella,Where are they?
lrrh,Jack? Mr. Baker?
cinderella,Jack?
jack,Over here!
lrrh,Jack!
cinderella,"Oh, be careful, are you alright?"
jack,Where is he?
cinderella,He's not with you?
lrrh,Mr. Baker? All three feverishly look for him.
baker,"Jack, Jack!"
jack,Help me. Help me!
baker,"Jack, I'm here. CINDERELLA helps JACK lift the tree branch as the BAKER, breathless, crawls out from beneath its grasp. He is scratched up, but relieved. CINDERELLA takes the BABY from"
cinderella,Let me take him.
baker, Are you okay? Are you alright? We did it! We did it! Come here. They embrace the BAKER. There's a moment of realization of what just happened as they look up at the roots of the fallen tree.
jack,What home? I have no one to take care of me.
lrrh," And we have nowhere to go, so we'll move in with you."
baker,If you want to.
cinderella,I'll gladly help you with your house. There are times when I actually enjoy cleaning.
baker,"Here -- give him to me. The BAKER walks away from the group, trying to settle his SON. He wraps his SCARF around the BABY."
baker,"Shhhh. As the Baker holds his son close, the baby begins to calm down for the first time in his father's arms and his WIFE disappears. The BAKER tells the story to his son -- THE SAME STORY AS WE"
