Speaker,Dialogue
narrator,"Everyone's got that one summer when they were a kid... a summer so perfect, that it stays with them forever. It stays caught in time, like Camelot. pause That summer is like a book with a million blank pages that you get to fill with the greatest story you could ever dream up.  This is a story about a legend. And for us, that summer was the one when the legend got made."
narrator,"Fourteen years later, after The Babe was gone, there was another guy who had something to do with the legend getting made too. A guy who set a record that summer that was so awesome, some people still don't believe it."
umpire,Safe!
ham,PICKLE!
squints,Thirty-one! Maury Wills just stole number thirty-one!
other team," Crap! Can't beat that guy! Ya dufuses, why'd ya get him in a pickle for?! Ya know he's the damn pickle king! Rubba legs for sure! Truly rubba legs."
squints,Game over. Sixteen zip. Murderers' Row remains undefeated.
opponent,Hey! We never got our ups!
ham,"Great, I'm dyin' a thirst and you pee me out!"
benny,"Ham, it ain't really."
ham,Then switch with me.
benny,Do I look stupid?
narrator,"I moved to the neighborhood about a month before school let out. I was from another state, and didn't have a single friend in a thousand miles."
narrator,"It was a lousy way to end up the 5th grade, 'cause I had zip time to make friends before summer. And that's about where it all started..."
ham,"Fifth grade's history, man. A hundred days, man. A Hundred days of baseball. All Day, everyday, as much as we can. That's the best."
timmy,We got all summer.
repeat,We got all summer.
benny,Let's play.
narrator,Everyone but the Timmons twins lived on my new block.
narrator,"...later, it would become second only to Cape Canaveral as a command post for history.  When I moved in that summer, I'd never played baseball, but it wasn't too tough figuring out who these guys' heroes were. So, after a week of watching... I figured baseball seemed like the best way to get in with them."
scotty,"Sorry, Mom."
mom,I thought we agreed we'd take this apart... and not spend so much time in here.
scotty, I know - but it's just nighttime.
mom,"Scotty, have you made any friends yet?"
scotty,No.
mom,"Why not, honey?"
scotty,"'Cause I'm still ""new."""
mom,"Honey, I don't want you sitting in here all summer fiddling with this stuff, like you did last summer... and the one before that.  Scotty, look at me. I know you're smart, and I'm proud of you. But you have to get outside, you have to... play."
scotty,None mothers I guess.
mom,"I want you to make friends this summer, Scotty. Lots of them."
scotty,"I know, but I don't - I'm no good at anything. Face it, Mom, I'm just an EGGHEAD -"
mom,"- and you'll always be just an egghead with an attitude like that. So promise me, alright?"
scotty,'Kay.
mom,Maybe tomorrow you'll make some friends.
scotty,"Yeah, maybe tomorrow.  Mom? Do you think Bill - I mean Dad - will teach me to play catch?"
mom,"Are you kidding, he'd love it, you know what an athlete he wasIn high school.  You know what a pitcher he was in high college."
narrator,"My real dad died when I was just a little kid. My mom married Bill a year before we moved to the neighborhood.  At the time, he and I were still getting used to each other."
scotty,"Um, Dad - sorry, I mean Bill, remember you promised you'd teach me to play catch?"
bill,Um hum...
scotty,"Well, could you teach me?"
bill,Sure.
scotty,Okay. Great. Thanks.
bill,Um hum.
ham,"Hey-hey, come on! Wait up - wait up!"
narrator,"They never kept score. They never chose sides. They never even really stopped playing the game... it just went on forever. Everyday they picked up right where they left off the day before. It was an endless ""dream game.""  I didn't know any of that then... I just knew they were having the time of their lives and I wanted to be a part of it."
timmy,Nice catch!
repeat,Nice catch!
ham,Hey! Throw the ball back!
bertram,"We gotta a game here, man!"
scotty,"'Kay, I'll get it!  Don't be a goofus - don't be a goofus - don't be a goofus."
squints,WE'RE WAITING...
scotty, My life is over.
denunez,"Come on, Benny-man, didn't you see that throw?"
ham, That kid's got the gaw'damn panty- waistiest arm I ever saw in my whole life.
squints,"I seen a guy once that threw like that. I mean not that bad, but at least so bad that he hadda move in the fourth grade 'cause they nicknamed him ""Bloomers."""
benny,I bet not one of you knows how The Babe got his nickname.
ham,"Easy, 'cause of the way he looked like a little kid face."
bertram,"Bull, it's just 'cause he liked kids and stuff."
squints,"Wrong. The Babe was called The Babe, because he was like the child of Yankee Stadium."
benny,"I knew it. You're all full of crap. George Herman Ruth got his nickname because his mom died when he was just a little kid, and he hadda go live in an orphanage."
narrator,"Everyone knew Benny was different. Nobody ever voted or anything, but he was the leader."
narrator,"Even though he seemed like a regular guy, he wasn't. Benny was special, and he was loyal.  When they'd all tried out for youth league, they'd all made it. But when they found out they'd have to play on different teams, Benny told 'em that if they couldn't play together, they shouldn't play at all. So, they stayed together. 18"
narrator,"So, the only person that ever felt sorry for me 'cause I was such a weenie was Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez.  Connected as friends... born to meet for just that one moment."
scotty,Sorry...
mom, Well?...
scotty,"He's too busy, Mom."
mom, Go back in there and ask. He'll take the time. Go on. 19
scotty,"Um, Da -"
bill,"Um, yeah, but later, okay? I gotta get this done."
scotty,"Okay, thanks."
mom,"Bill, can't you take a break and teach him now?"
scotty,"Mom, it's okay - "
bill,"Honey, I said I would and I will. I'm just under the gun here, ya know?"
scotty,"Mom, really -"
mom,- How long could it take? You can't spare a half hour to show him?
bill, Fine. Alright. I'll get my glove. Come on.
mom, There. See. Told you so.
bill,Keep your eye on the ball. Put the glove up where it goes. Okay?
scotty,"Yeah, okay, I think so."
bill,"That's alright, just throw it back."
scotty,Here.
bill,Keep your eye on the ball. Put the glove up where the ball goes.
scotty,Darn. My glove got -
bill,"- not bad. Right side at least. Now, just throw it back this time."
scotty,But my glove -
bill," Oh, my God."
bill,"Alright, Scott, listen, this one's gonna come right at you, easy, okay?"
scotty,'Kay.
bill,Just keep your eye on the ball and put your glove up. You'll catch it.
scotty,Okay.
bill,Oh my -
benny,"- God, whadda jerk!"
mom,Bill! What happened?!
bill,"Well, he -"
scotty," - just took my eye off the ball, Mom."
bill,"There. Keep that on for an hour. It'll still be black, but it won't swell.  Sorry. We'll try again soon."
benny,Gonna go play some ball. Need a extra guy. Wanna go?
scotty,Naw. Thanks.
benny,Why not? Doncha like baseball?
scotty,"Oh. Yeah. But, ah..."
benny,But what?
scotty,"But my glove's busted. So, ya know, I can't go. Thanks, though."
benny,That's okay.
scotty,Mom! I'm gonna go play some ball!
benny,"Yeah. Cool shiner. We gotta stop by the 5 & 10 first. Need a new ball. And chaw and stuff, ya know?"
scotty,Yeah.
benny,You dip chaw?
scotty, Sure. A'course.
ham,Hey! Check me out! I'm the Great Bambino!
scotty, Who's that?
ham,What?...  What did he say?
bertram,"Were you born in a barn, man?"
squints,You never heard of The Sultan of Swat?!
denunez,The Titan of Terror!
timmy,The Colossus of Clout!
repeat,The Colossus of Clout!
benny, The King of Krash!
narrator,"I had no idea who they were talking about. But there was no way I could let them know that... so, I lied."
scotty,Oh! The Great Bambino! Of course. I thought you said The Great Bambi.
ham, That wimpy deer?
scotty,"Ah, yeah - I guess. Sorry."
benny, He's Scott Smalls.
scotty,Hi.
benny,He's gonna play with us. He makes nine. Now we got a team.
bertram,"Why'd you bring him for, Benny?"
benny,"'Cause there's eight of us, and he makes nine."
bertram,"Yeah, so would my sister, but I didn't bring her!"
benny,With nine Guys we got a whole team.
ham,"No, with Elswenger we had a whole team, and Elswenger could throw!"
denunez,"He ain't game, Benny. He can't throw for nothin'."
timmy,"Benny, you already play all the empty positions since Elswenger moved to Arizona."
benny,And now I get to rotate 8 positions
squints,"No you don't. It's stupid, Benny. The kid's an L-7 weenie."
benny,"Oh yeah, Squints, and you're Willie freakin' Mays. You catch like a dork - anybody ever bust your chops about that?"
squints," No, but I'm - ya know, I'm -"
benny,"- and you run like a duck, Yeah- Yeah."
benny,- part-a the game.
squints, Right.
benny,How come he don't get to be?
scotty, Right. Okay. Ah... where exactly is that?
benny," Uh, over there."
scotty,"Here. Sorry, sorry."
benny,"Hey, you can throw it ya know."
scotty,"No, I can't... I don't know how.  Um, thanks for taking me here... but I think better go."
benny,"You think too much. I bet you get straight A's and shit, huh?"
scotty,"No, I got a B once. Actually it was an A minus.  But it shoulda been a B."
benny,"This is baseball, you're not supposed to think, you're just supposed to play.  You ever have a paper route?"
scotty,"Uh, I helped a guy one time."
benny,Throw it like you chuck a paper. When your arm gets here... just let go of it.  Just let go.
scotty,Wait - how do I catch it?
benny,Don't worry. Just stand there and stick your glove in the air. I'll take care of it.
scotty,"Please, catch it. Please, catch it. Please, ca -"
bertram,"Okay! Hey, let's play ball!"
scotty,Thanks.
benny,Keep it.
narrator,"Everyday, first thing, we'd all pick a card from what we called ""The Dugout."""
benny,Bingo! Maury Wills!
scotty,"Mickey Mou - ah, Mantle."
denunez,Stan Musial.
timmy,Lou Brock.
repeat,"Lou Brock - I mean, Luis Aparicio."
bertram,Frank Robinson.
squints,Oh... Bob Uecker.

scotty,"Wait a sec, I'll get it!"
gang,NOOOOOOOOOO! STOPPPPPP!
squints,"Holy crap, you coulda been killed!"
scotty,"Well, you were all leavin', so I thought I'd just -"
squints,- if you were thinkin' you wouldn't a thought that!
benny,"You can't go back there, Smalls."
scotty,Then how do we get the ball?
timmy,We don't.
repeat,We don't.
bertram,It's gone.
ham,Forever even.
denunez,"Forget it, it's a memory."
benny,Game's over. We'll get a new one tomorrow. Just forget it. We'll never see it again.
scotty,Why not?
gang, The Beast.
benny,"Go over there, real slow, and be quiet. Don't touch the fence, just peek through that hole in the green stuff... go on."
scotty,Something got the ball!  What was that thing?!
gang,Campout.
ham,Wanna s'more?
scotty,Some more of what?
ham,No. You wanna s'more?
scotty,"I haven't had anything yet, so how can I have any more of nothing?"
ham,"You kill me Smalls. Look, these are s'mores stuff. Pay attention:  First you take the graham - you put the chocolate on the graham, Hershey's of course - you hold the chocolate on the graham while you roast the mallow-"
squints,"Alright, listen up.  First time DeNunez heard this story he FAINTED -"
denunez,"- Bull, Squints!"
benny,"You did, man."
squints,When Yeah-Yeah heard it he peed his pants.
ham,"You did, man."
squints,And when The Ham heard it he barfed up two bags of marshmallows.
ham,Liar! It was only one.
squints,"So stay away from the door... you might fall out. And don't sit on your sleeping bag... you could shit your pants.  Now, quiet..."
squints,"And so... The Beast sits there under that lean-to, dreaming about the time when he can break the chain and get out... dreaming of the time when he can chase and kill again."
bertram,"See, man. That's why you can't go over there. Nobody ever has. Nobody ever will."
ham,"One kid did, but nobody ever seen him again."
denunez,That ain't true -
ham,- yeah it is! He got eaten!
denunez,"""Boogers"" Fleming?"
timmy,No. It was that guy with the warts on his face.
repeat,"Davy ""The Toad."""
timmy,That's what I said.
squints,"Davy ""The Toad"" Stodenrous."
bertram,"Yeah, The Toad..."
scotty, Nuh-uh... none of that's true. You guys are just -
squints,"- oh, yeah?... Come here. Stick your head out the window and look down."
scotty, He's down there!
squints,You bet he is.
ham,Whatever goes over that fence... stays there.
squints,It becomes the property of The Beast... Forever.
narrator,I learned that more than a 150 baseballs had gone over that fence... and not one of them was ever seen again. Even when some brave kid worked up enough courage to peek over the fence. 
benny,What took you so long?! We been here forever already!
squints,"Shut up, I wasn't!"
squints,Hold me back! Hold me back!
ham,I am holdin' you back Squints.
squints,"Oh, yeah. Well, lemme go then. "
denunez,"So, where'd you get the money this time Yeah-Yeah?"
ham,Sonavabitch!
benny,"- naw, don't, man. He's just mad he didn't think of it."
ham,"Yeah, you know how many lawns I hadda mow when it was my turn?! Geez. Let's play."
ham,"I can't take it no more, Benny. I'm bakin' like a toasted cheeser!"
timmy,It's hotter than the fires of hell.
repeat,It's hotter than a fish in a fryin' pan.
benny,"Come on, don't be wimpy."
squints,"Face it, Benny. It's not a fit day out for man nor beast. We gotta call it for the day."
benny,"Vote then. Everyone that wants to be a can't-hack-it panty waist, and wear their momma's bra, raise your hand."
gang,Scam Pool Honeys!
ham,Hamonball!
narrator,"Benny would've played ball all day and all night... rain shine, tidal wave, whatever, it didn't matter. Baseball was the only thing he cared about and everything else was just a waste of time.  But, of all the things we ever did besides baseball, goin' to the pool was what he tolerated best. Even though none of us had ever seen a Playboy magazine - which we constantly lied about - we figured the pool was the next best thing to being there."
benny,"Oh, man..."
timmy,She don't know what she's doing.
repeat,She don't know what she's doing.
benny,Yeah she does. She knows exactly what she's doing.
squints,I've swum here every summer of my adult life... and every summer there she is.  I - can't - take - this - no - more!
scotty,What's wrong with him?
bertram,Squints!
ham,Oh my God! He's drowning!
lifeguard,You little pervert!
ham,Did you plan that?!
squints,A'course I did. Been plannin' it for years.
narrator,"Michael ""Squints"" Palledorous walked a little taller that day. And we had to tip our hats to him. He was lucky she hadn't beat the crap out of him. We wouldn't have blamed her. What he'd done was sneaky, rotten and low.  We got banned from the pool forever that day... but every time we walked by after that, the Lifeguard looked down from her watchtower, right over at Squints... and smiled."
ham,Eee! Eee! Eee! Oh! Oh! Oh!
ham,"Shut up, blockhead."
benny,"Play us and you'll find out why, Phillips."
squints,"Benny, man, are we gonna let 'em get away with that?!"
benny,Yeah. For now. Let's go.
scotty,You think he really died in the end?
benny,Who?
scotty,King Kong...
squints,Not possible. He's so big that fallin' off the Empire State's just like us fallin' off a roof... he's alive.
scotty,So whadda you think happened to him?
timmy,Most likely.
scotty,"Hey, guys? Has anyone ever really seen The Beast?"
squints,"Look, Smalls. You ever seen King Kong for real? In person, I mean?"
scotty,No. But -
squints,"- well, he's real right?"
scotty,"Yeah, a'course."
squints,And he's still out there somewhere right?
scotty,Yeah.
squints,"See, there's just somethings that are. Ya know, stuff that it's better not to talk about... 'cause thinkin' about it just makes it worse.  Nobody has to see The Beast to know he's there."
scotty, You don't think that The Beast is really...
gang,"King Kong? Naw! God is that stupid! No stinkin' way! Oh boy, had me feelin' like a douf there for a minute! Whew, what a relief!"
ham,"Hey, who d'ya think'd win in a fight, King Kong or Godzilla?"
gang,Godzilla. King Kong. 'Zilla! Kong! 'ZILLA! KONG!
gang,"Yeah. That would be cool. I'd see that. Kong would kick his ass. No way, 'Zilla's got that fire breath stuff, he'd fry the monkey! 56"
narrator,"Besides The Great Bambino, who I still had no clue about, Benny had one living hero."
benny,"Naw he ain't, not yet."
narrator,A guy that would break the stolen bases record that year that had stood for as many years as there were baseball's lost to The Beast.
gang,"He's gonna go, Benny. Here he goes, man. Right now, watch, watch. There, there!"
benny,No... not yet.
narrator,Maury Wills became a hero for what he did.
benny,He's... gonna... go... riiiight... now.
gang, How'd you know that? How'd you guess? How'd ya know?
narrator,Benny... would become a Legend.
benny," Get your glove, c'mon."
scotty,What's the big deal?
benny,Nightgame!
narrator,"There was only one nightgame a year. On the Fourth of July, the whole sky would brighten up with fireworks, giving us just enough light for a game.  Benny felt like that all the time."
timmy,Truly rubba legs.
repeat,Truly rubba legs.
benny,"What'id you say, crapface?"
ham,"Come on! We'll take you on right here, right now! Come on! Right now!"
ham,"Watch yer mouth, jerk!"
ham,Asshole!
ham,Butt sniffer!
ham,Fart smeller!
ham,You mix yer Wheaties with your momma's toe jam!
ham,YOU PLAY BALL LIKE A GIRL!
ham,You heard me.
ham,"Count on it, pee drinkin' craphead."
ham,PLAAAAAAAY BALLLLLLLL!
benny,Somebody get it!
ham,"You - are - out - of - here! Out! Gone! Dead! To the moon! Roger, Wilco, Over and OUT!"
benny, That's one. Get used to it.
benny,"Crack! Boom! Outta here! You see the looks on their faces? Did ya? It was like, ""Duh... so that's how you play baseball."""
bertram,Crap! I almost forgot. Chaw!
scotty,What is it?
ham,"Geez, Smalls... I s'pose you don't who The Babe is either. It's chaw. Plug. Wad. Chewing Tobacco!"
scotty,Whadda you do with it?
ham,"You're killin' me, Smalls. You chew it, of course."
denunez,All the pros do.
timmy,Let's dip.
repeat,Let's dip.
benny,Smooth.
ham,Juicy.
squints,Tangy.
scotty,Kinda tastes like an ashtray smells.
denunez,Supposed to.
squints,Let's ride.
mom,"I'll be back in an hour, Scotty, I'm taking Dad to the airport."
scotty, 'Kay. Where you goin'?
bill,"Chicago, on business for a week. Listen, Scott, while I'm gone, you're the man of the house. Understand?"
scotty,"Yeah, I guess so."
bill,"We'll take another stab at catch when I get back, okay? So, take care of things while I'm gone. I'm counting on you."
scotty, Okay. I will.
narrator,"Once we got over trying to be big shots, we just stuck to what we could handle, and swore off the hard stuff forever. When we finally got back together for some baseball, something amazing happened.  It was an omen... one that was meant just for Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez. 68"
squints,"Whad'ya get, Ham?"
ham,A Mickey Mantle and 7 guys I never heard of. How 'bout you?
squints,A Brooks Robinson and a Koufax. Pretty good.
bertram,I got junk.
denunez,"One Drysdale, a bunch a duds."
squints,"Benny, whad -"
ham,"Hey, Benny, whatsa matter?"
bertram,"You okay, man?"
squints,"Oh, my God..."
timmy,Imfuckingpossible.  Unstinkinbelievable!
repeat,Imfuckingpossible. Don't tell mom I said that tim.
timmy,I won't.
ham,This can't happen... can it?
bertram,It just did.
squints,Oh geez... Oh geez. I - I don't believe it. Maury Wills just stole 80 bases!
benny,"We gotta play. I gotta play right now, guys. Right now."
scotty,What's it mean?
squints,"It's a miracle, Smalls. A damn miracle."
narrator,We all expected something to happen right then... during that game. What we had just witnessed was bordering on the supernatural... we knew that greater hands than ours were at work.  It happened right in front of our noses... and we didn't even know it.
bertram,Bitchin'.
benny,"Naw, it ain't."
squints,"C'mon, Benny, maybe two, three guys in history have ever busted the guts out of a ball. That's what the omen was."
gang,"Truly. Sure. Absolutely. Yeah-yeah, Benny. It must be so."
benny,"All's it means is that we can't play no more. It's only noon, and I just blew the whole day for us."
denunez,"No, you didn't. It's the most amazing thing I ever seen."
benny,"Anybody got any money?  Then it ain't okay, 'cause now we can't play no more."
scotty,"Yeah, we can."
benny,"What, you got 98 extra cents just layin' around at home, Smalls?"
scotty,"No, but I got a ball."
scotty, I got it! Let's play!
benny,"Bitchin'. Your ball, your ups."
ham,Batter up!
timmy,"Nice crank, Smalls."
denunez,Decent cut.
benny,"It's outta here! Who's got the big bat now, boys!"
gang,Smalls. Smalls. Smalls. Smalls.
ham,What the hell's he doing?
bertram,Maybe the shock of his first homer was just too much for him.
scotty,We gotta get that ball back.
ham,"Right! Good one, Smalls."
squints,"Sure. We'll just hop over and say, excuse me Mr. Beast sir, could we have our ball back, oh, and please don't kill us while we're here!"
benny,"It was a great shot, but forget about it... game's over. We'll get another ball."
scotty,You don't understand!
benny,"Sure we do. You feel bad 'cause you belted a homer, and now we can't play no more."
scotty,No! You don't understand! THAT WASN'T MY BALL!
squints,Whadda you mean it wasn't your ball?
scotty,It's my stepdad's. I stole it from his trophy room. It was a present or soemthing - somebody gave it to him. We have to get it back. He's gonna kill me!
squints,Smalls... listen to me. This is a matter of life and death.  Where did your old man get that ball?
scotty,I dunno... I think some lady gave it to him.
squints,Some lady?...
scotty,"Yeah, she even signed her name on it.  Some lady named Ruth... Baby Ruth."
gang,BAAAYYYBE RUUUUUTH?!
denunez,The Beast got it.
timmy,"You're dead as a doornail, Smalls."
repeat,"You're dead as a doornail, Smalls."
timmy,Nice knowing you.
repeat,Nice knowing -
timmy,"- shut up, Tommy.  Smalls, you mean to tell me you went home and swiped a ball that was signed by Babe Ruth, and brought it out here and actually played with it?"
repeat,And actually played with it?!
scotty,"Yeah, but I was gonna put it back."
squints,But it was signed by Babe Ruth!
scotty,"Well, who is she?!"
ham,What?! What?!  What did he say?!
denunez,The Sultan of Swat!
bertram,The King of Krash!
gang,BABE RUTH!
ham, The Great Bambino!
scotty," OH, MY GOD! THAT'S THE SAME GUY?!"
benny,"Yeah. Smalls, Babe Ruth is the greatest baseball player that ever lived. People say he was less than a God, but more than a man. Ya know... like Hercules or somethin'.  The ball that you just aced to The Beast is worth... well, more than your whole life."
scotty,I don't feel so good.
benny,When does your old man get home from work?
scotty,He's gone on business for a week.
benny,"Okay, we need 98 cents. So, everybody spread out and find some soda bottles and cash 'em in. We need a new baseball."
denunez,"I dunno, Benny-man."
squints,"He ain't gonna buy that, Benny. It doesn't look anything like the Babe's signature."
benny,"It doesn't matter what it looks like. His mom's never gonna know the difference. This'll just buy us some time, ya dorks."
scotty,Huh?!
mom,"Honey, what are you doing in here?"
scotty,Ah... just looking at Bill's - I mean Dad's baseball.
mom,You know he doesn't like you touching his things.
scotty,"Yeah, I know. Sorry, Mom."
mom,Has he ever told you about that ball?
scotty,"Uh - no, not really, I don't think so - no, he hasn't at all - I don't know _anything_ about it."
mom,It's signed by Babe Ruth...
scotty,Um... really?
mom,"It sure is. Dad's father gave it to him. Maybe someday, he'll give it to you."
scotty, Uh... neat.
narrator,"It was salt in an open wound. Even my own mom, who was only a grown-up girl, knew who Babe Ruth was."
scotty,"So, how do we get it back?"
squints,I have no idea.
narrator,I was dead meat. I knew it. They knew it. We had thought that those cards Benny had gotten meant that something great was going to happen. Now I figured that they'd just meant my life was over.
scotty,Can't we just hop the fence and get it?
ham,Remember Davy Stodenrous.
scotty,"Oh, yeah. I forgot.  Hey? Why don't we just go over there and knock on the door, and ask Mr. Mertle to get it for us?"
squints,"Are you outta your mind?! Mr. Mertle is the meanest old man that ever lived! He's the one that sicked The Beast on The Toad!  That's not an option, Smalls. Forget about it."
scotty,Oh. Okay. I will.
squints,We need to assess the situation!
gang, the situation! Okay!
bertram,"Um, Squints? How do we do that?"
squints,"First we survey the enemy's environment, then we make note of the surrounding terrain."
ham,What?...
squints," I heard that on ""Combat."" Let's just look out the window."
timmy,He's darin' us!
repeat,He's darin' us!
denunez,"He's waitin' for us, man. Just like he did with The Toad."
gang, Poor Toad.
ham,We're on his territory now.
bertram,Think he's pissed?
benny,Is Doby Gillis a dork? Anybody got any bright ideas?
narrator,We had absolutely no idea what the hell we were gonna do. So things started primitively.
bertram,"It ain't mine. I told you, it's my little sister's!"
squints,We've been going about this all wrong. I blame myself. We need total surprise. 
squints,Yeah-Yeah! Get hold of yourself! What'd you see?!
ham,- somebody slap him quick! We're losin' him!
benny,"Sorry, Smalls. It was a good idea anyway."
denunez,"Yeah, tough luck, Smalls."
ham,"It won't be that bad, Smalls. Your dad'll probably only shoot you or something."
benny,Here. Put these on.
benny,"Oh, ah, nuthin', ya know, just For, ah... Altitude leveling And stuff. Put it on."
timmy,Don't worry. We're professionals.
repeat,Our Dad's a contractor.
ham,HELP! I'M LOSIN' HIM!
narrator,"Yeah-Yeah grew two feet in our eyes after that. There was no stinkin' way any of us would've showed back up, if we'd loaded our drawers.  Yeah-Yeah did. He showed back up and got right to work, like nothing ever happened."
scotty,I think I know how to get it.  Anybody got an Erector Set?
squints,That thing with the nuts and bolts and tiny wrenches that you can build junk out of?
scotty,Exactly.
squints,Never heard of it.
ham,"I used to have one when I was like I dunno, a little kid."
gang," Might have some pieces. Gee, I don't think so. I'd have to look. Maybe in the attic. Not in our room though."
bertram,Bitchin'.
scotty,I really like Erector Set.
gang," Me too. I was just thinkin' the same thing. Couldn't agree more, Smalls. I play with mine all the time."
scotty,Let's get to work. Here's the plans -
squints, Fire!
benny,I got it! I got it!
narrator,"My life was over. Just as Bill had finally warmed up to me, and asked me to be the man of the house, I had to knock a priceless chunk of history into the clutches of a monster. Great."
benny,"We can't get it back, Babe.  I'm sorry."
the babe,"Now don't go peeing your pants or nuthin', I'm just here to give ya a hand."
benny,"B - B - But, you're..."
the babe,"...dead? Legends never die, kid."
benny,You're really him. You're The Babe. The Sultan of Swat. The King -
the babe,"- of Krash and a hundred other dopey names. Forget about that, we ain't got much time. I'm here 'cause you're in some kinda pickle, right?"
benny,Yeah.
the babe,"A baseball with my John Hancock on it went over a fence, and you can't get it back. Right?"
benny,"Yeah, right."
the babe," See ya, kid."
benny,Wait! I can't.
the babe,Can't what?
benny,Go into that backyard.
the babe,Why not?
benny,There's a Beast back there.
the babe,What kind?
benny,A giant gorilla-dog-thing that ate one kid already.
the babe,"Is that a fact? Listen to me, kid. "
benny,"Sure, yeah, five Maury Wills all in the same pack."
the babe,What're the odds on that?
benny,About a zillion to one.
the babe,"More even. Someone's tellin' you somethin', kid. And if I was you... I'd listen."
benny,"Yeah, but what?"
the babe,"You're the one with the rubba legs. Figure it out.  You gotta do what your heart tells you, else you'll spend the rest of your life wishin' you had."
benny,"You mean, I should hop that fence - and pickle with THE BEAST?!"
the babe,Lemme tell you something... you remember that called shot homer I hit?
benny,"Sure, the greatest most famous and legendary home run of all time."
the babe,"Yeah, right, well said. "
benny,"Sure ya did, Babe."
the babe,"Not a chance. Matter of fact, all the way down to first I kept sayin' to myself, ""you lucky bum.""  Think about that, kid. I'll see ya later."
benny, I had a dream. Get dressed. We're goin' to the sandlot.
scotty,"Benny - wait. It's okay, it was my fault. I'll just take whatever I get. You don't have to do this."
benny," Yeah I do, Smalls. I have to."
benny,YOWWWWW!
benny,OOOOH SSSSHIT!
scotty,What're we waitin' for?! Let's go after 'em!
toddler, Big goggy.
benny,Sandlot!
squints,This way! Shortcut!
benny,LOOK OUT!
benny,I GOT IT!
scotty,Help him! I'm stuck! I'm stuck! Help him!
scotty,Pick him up! Scoot him up so I can let him off!  COME ON!
benny,We can play forever now.
scotty,"Um, we brought your dog home."
scotty,"Well, sir... um, we kind of, well, what happened was -"
benny,- we hit a baseball into your yard. Then we tried to get it and -
scotty,You knew Babe Ruth?
benny,Yeah.
scotty," Yes, sir."
scotty,"Well, you see... that ball belongs to my stepdad... and, uh - it was signed by Babe Ruth."
scotty,I don't think so.
scotty,"Yes, sir..."
benny,"Well, that's really nice of you... but this ball really is signed by The Babe."
benny,Oh my God - Murderers' Row.
scotty,Babe Ruth.
scotty,Deal.
bill,This better be good.
narrator,"It was weird that Benny said Babe Ruth was like the Hercules of baseball, and then The Beast's name turned out to be Hercules.  It was also strange that Mr. Mertle had a Murderers' Row ball to replace the one signed by The Babe."
mom,"Guys, supper's ready."
dad, Give us another ten minutes. I'm helpin' my boy break in his new glove.
narrator,That was the last summer that we all got to play together. 
coach," Give 'em hell, Jet."
the jet,"I'll do my best, Maury."
umpire,SAFE! SAFE! SAFE!
scott, The Jet stole home! The Jet stole home!!
