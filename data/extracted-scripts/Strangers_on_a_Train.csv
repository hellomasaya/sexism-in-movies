Speaker,Dialogue
final draft,"October 18, 1950"
bruno," I beg your pardon, but aren't you Guy Haines."
bruno," Sure! I saw you blast Faraday right off the court in South Orange last season. What a backhand! Made the semi-finals, didn't you?"
bruno, I'm Bruno Anthony. Bruno. See Guy looks up. Bruno indicates his gold tie pin which bears his name in cut- out letters. Guy looks at it with the faintest expression of disdain. I suppose you think it's corny. But my mother gave it to me so of course I wear it to please her.
guy, How do you do.
bruno, I don't usually talk so much.   Go Ahead and read.
guy, Thanks. Guy tries to read but is uneasily aware of Bruno's open appraisal.
bruno,It must be pretty exciting to be so important.
guy, A tennis player isn't so important.
bruno,People who do things are important. I never seem to do anything.
bruno, I suppose you're going to Southampton -- for the doubles.
guy, You are a tennis fan.
bruno,"Wish I could see you play. But I've got to be back in Washington tomorrow. I live in Arlington, you know."
bruno,Cigarette?
guy,"Not now, thanks.          I don't smoke much."
bruno,I smoke too much.
bruno,Thanks.  Elegant.
bruno's voice, To G from A. Bet I can guess who A is.
guy, Yes?
bruno,"Anne Burton. Sometimes I turn the sport page and look at the society news. And the pictures. She's very beautiful, Senator Burton's daughter."
guy,"You're quite a reader, Mr. Anthony."
bruno,"Yes, I am. Ask me anything, from today's stock reports to Li'l Abner, and I got the answer. "
guy, Perhaps you read too much.
bruno," There I go again. Too friendly. I meet someone I' like and open my yap too wide. I'm sorry... At the appeal on Bruno's face, Guy slowly relents."
guy,That's all right. Forget it.    I guess I'm pretty jumpy.
bruno,There's a new cure for that.  Only kind of doubles I play.
guy,You'll have to drink both of them.
bruno, When's the wedding?
guy,What?
bruno,The wedding. You and Anne Burton.  It was in the papers.
guy,It shouldn't have been. Unless they've legalized bigamy overnight.
bruno,I have a theory about that. I'd like to tell you about it some time. But right now I suppose divorce Is still the simplest operation.
guy, This is wonderful -- having your company all the way to New York.
guy," As a matter of fact, I'm not going direct. I'm stopping off. At Metcalf."
bruno,Metcalf? What would anybody want to go there for?
guy,It's my home town.
bruno,"Oh, I get it! A little talk with your wife to about the divorce! I suppose she was the girl next door. Held her hand in high school and before you knew it -- hooked!  Am I right?"
guy, Close enough.
bruno," Well, here's luck, Guy. Drink up -- then we'll have some lunch sent to my compartment."
guy,Thanks very much. But I think I'll go to the dining car.  Do you know if there are any vacant seats in the dining car now?
waiter,"Not for about twenty minutes I'm afraid, Sir."
bruno," What'll you have, Guy?"
guy,"Thanks just the same, but I really don't think --"
bruno,"Oh, go on and order."
guy,"Well, I'll Just have a hamburger and a cup of coffee."
bruno, To the next Mrs. Haines.
bruno,"Sure, I went to college. Three of them. Every time they kicked me out my father threw me back in.  You my friend, Guy?"
guy,"Sure.   I'm your friend, Bruno."
bruno, My father hates me.
guy,You must be imagining things.
bruno," And I hate him. He thinks   I ought to catch the eight-five bus  every morning, punch a timeclock  and work my way up selling paint or  something. Him -- with all his money!"
guy," Well, what do you want to do?"
bruno,You mean before or after I kill him?
guy," Before, of course."
bruno," I want to do everything. I got a theory you're supposed to do everything before you die. Have you ever driven a car, blindfolded, at a hundred and fifty miles an hour?"
guy,"Not lately. BRUNO I did. I flew in a jet plans too.  Zzzzzzzp! Man, that's a thrill! Almost blow the sawdust out of my head. I'm going to make a reservation on the first rocket to the moon..."
guy, What are you trying prove?
bruno,"I'm not like you, Guy. You're lucky. You're smart. Marrying the boss's daughter is a nice short cut to a career, isn't it?"
guy, Marrying the senator's daughter has nothing to do with it. Can't a fellow look past a tennis not without being a goldbricker?
bruno,"Take it easy, boy. I'm your friend, remember? I'd do anything for you."
bruno,What'd you say her name was -- your wife's?
guy,Miriam.
bruno,"That's it. Miriam Joyce Haines. Played around a lot, I suppose? GUY Let's not talk about it any more."
bruno, Maybe she'll make more trouble for you.
guy,I don't think so.
bruno,You mean you got enough on her to get your divorce no matter what?
guy,"Let's change subject, Bruno, can't we?"
bruno,"Okay, Guy. Want me to tell you one of my ideas for murdering my father?"
guy, You've been reading too many of these.
bruno," You want to hear about the busted light socket in the bathroom, or the carbon monoxide in the garage?"
guy,"No. I may be old fashioned, but I thought murder was against the law."
bruno,But not against the law of nature. My theory is that everybody is a potential murderer. Didn't you ever want to kill somebody? Say one of those useless fellows Miriam was running around with?
guy,You can't go around killing people just because you think they're useless.
bruno,"Oh, what's a life or two? Some people are bitter off dead, Guy. Take your -- wife and my father, for instance. It reminds me of a wonderful idea had once. I used to put myself to sleep at night -- figuring it out. Now, let's say you want to get rid of your wife."
guy,Why?
bruno,Let's say she refuses to give you a divorce --  Let's say. You'd be afraid to kill her because you'd get caught. And what would trip you up? Motive. Now here's the plan...
guy,I'm afraid I haven't time to listen.
bruno," It's so simple, too. A couple of fellows meet accidentally, like you and me. No connection between them at all. Never saw each other before. Each of them has somebody he'd like to get rid of, but he can't murder the person he wants to get rid of. He'll get caught. So they swap murders."
guy,Swap murders?
bruno,Each fellow does the other fellow's murder. Then there is nothing to connect them. The one who had the motive isn't there. Each fellow murders a total stranger. Like you do my murder and I do yours.
guy, We're coming into my station.
bruno,"For example, your wife, my father. Criss-cross. GUY  What?"
bruno," We do talk the same language -- don't we, Guy?"
guy," Sure, we talk the same language. Thanks for the lunch."
bruno, I'm glad you enjoyed it. I thought the lamb chops were a little overdone myself.
guy,"Nice meeting you, Bruno."
bruno," You think my theory is okay, Guy? You like it?"
guy,"Sure, sure, Bruno. They're all okay. "
bruno, Criss-cross.
guy,"Hi, Bill."
baggage man," Guy Haines! Good to too you, boy. You be sure to win at Southampton tomorrow, hear me? I've got two dollars on your nose."
guy," Then park these in a lucky spot for a few hours, will you?"
baggage man,Sure thing.
miriam," Well -- hello, Guy."
guy,"You're looking well, Miriam."
miriam,"So are you. You've got a nice tan, playing tennis with all your rich friends."
guy, What time do we meet your lawyer?
miriam, What's your hurry?
guy,"My hurry? That's funny, coming from you! You're the one who's in a hurry, aren't you?"
miriam," When you wouldn't give me the divorce right away, I sort of hoped it was because you were a little bit jealous."
guy," I got over being jealous, a long time ago Miriam. Miriam's eyes slide toward the other girl clerk who has moved closer, within listening range."
miriam, Let's talk in there.
miriam," Now this is cosier. Sort of like old times, isn't it, Guy?"
guy," Oh, skip it, Miriam. It's pretty late to start flirting with a discarded husband. Especially when you're going to have another man's baby."
miriam,"Do you know, I think you're handsomer than ever?"
guy,Let's see your lawyer and get this over with.
miriam,"Did you bring the money, Guy?   Lawyers are expensive."
guy, Here it is.
miriam," If I'd known what all that tennis nonsense of yours was going to lead to, I wouldn't have run out on you."
guy,"What are you trying to say, Miriam? Come out with it."
miriam, I'm not getting a divorce.
guy," Why, you little doublecrosser. I didn't want this divorce, you did. That's what you've been harping about for the past year."
miriam,It's a woman's privilege to change her mind... Now I can shop for some pretty clothes. I wouldn't want you to be ashamed of me in Washington when we go to all those dinners and swanky parties.
guy,And what do you mean by that?
guy,Let's not talk about Anne Burton.
miriam,"So, it's really serious between you two? Well, you can throw your dreams about her into the ashcan. Guy, I'm coming to Washington."
guy,What for? MIRIAM To have my baby and be with you.
guy,Why me?   It's not my baby.
miriam,"But people don't know that, Guy, do they? It would make a pretty story, wouldn't it -- the senator's daughter involved with a married man who's about to become a father."
guy, You black conniving little liar!
miriam,Keep your voice down.
guy,What happened? Did he run out on you?
miriam,No man runs out on me.   Not even you.
guy,"You're a liar and a  cheat,   Miriam. You've wanted to get  rid of   me long enough and now I'll  go you   one better -- I never want to see  or hear   of you again."
miriam," I could be very pathetic as the deserted little mother in a courtroom, Guy. Think it over. Who would believe you?  Guy seizes her angrily and in so doing, knocks the tone arm across the record with a loud screech. From outside we can see heads turn. Mr. Hargreaves, the manager, is very disturbed."
guy,...That's what should happen to people like you. And if I...
hargreaves," Break it up, folks. This isn't the place for a family quarrel."
guy, Sorry. I'm leaving.
miriam," You heard what I said, Guy Haines. You can't throw me away like an old shoe. I'm coming to Washington to have my baby. Tell that to the senate!"
guy,"Long distance.  I want Washington, D. C. The number is Republic 0800. Person to person. Miss Anne Burton."
guy, Right.
guy," No, everything didn't go smoothly. She doesn't want a divorce, not now...."
anne, But you sound so savage.
guy, What's that?
guy,I SAID I COULD STRANGLE HER!
bruno, I like them to look just right.
bruno,"No, Ma.   They look fine.   Thanks."
bruno,"I'm all right, Ma.   Don't worry about me."
bruno,I bought a bottle of them yesterday. A whole fifth.
bruno, About blowing up the White House?
bruno," I was only kidding, Ma. Besides, what would the president say?"
bruno,I'm sick and tired of bowing and scraping to the king.
insert," The painting is a horrible mess. Out of the violence of the pattern a man's face can be discerned, wild-eyed and distorted. We hear laughter from Bruno."
bruno,"You're wonderful, Ma! It's the old boy, all right. That's father! MRS. ANTHONY  It is? I was trying to paint Saint Francis."
butler," They are ready with your call to Southampton, Sir."
bruno, Hello...
bruno," Bruno, Bruno Anthony."
bruno,I just wanted to ask how you made out with Miriam.
guy, Metcalf? Who'd you say you were?
bruno," Bruno, Guy. Bruno Anthony. Don't you remember? On the train."
bruno, So she double-crossed you!   Are you going to see her again?
closeup, Bruno is glancing over the top of the paper.
long shot," From his viewpoint we   see a typical frame house. The upper windows are lit as are   the lower ones as well. A woman is sitting in a rocker on   the front porch.  This is MRS. JOYCE, Miriam's mother. She    has white hair. A  woman comes along the street and pauses   as she gets to Mrs. Joyce. "
woman," Hello Mrs. Joyce. Warm, ain't it?"
woman,I've been reading where your son-in- law's been coming right along at tennis.
close up," Bruno, still glancing over the top of his paper."
long shot," Again from Bruno's viewpoint, we see Miriam's house. At this moment the front door swings open, emitting a long streak ot bright light. We see the silhouette of a woman emerge, followed by two other men. They're laughing and joking. Suddenly they look up the street. At this very moment the bus pulls up in front of Bruno's view, cutting off the sight of his quarry. The bus comes to a stop."
close shot, Bruno rises in alarm and moves around toward the end of the bus so that he shall not lose sight of the girl coming out of the house.
miriam," Goodnight, Mother.   See you later."
close up, Bruno watches Miriam.
close shot, Miriam's eye catches the attention of something off screen.
close up," The small boy turns and looks with dismay at his pricked balloon, wondering what happened."
medium shot," Miriam and her two boy-friends by the sledge hammer concession where the aim is to swing the hammer hard enough down onto its target to ring the bell and register the 100 mark. Miriam is in the foreground of the shot. The first boy steps up to try his hand. As he swings, Miriam turns and glances about her, obviously looking for Bruno."
medium shot," The first boy having failed to ring the bell, the second stops up and slams the hammer down."
close shot, The register shooting up only to the hallway mark.
close shot, Bruno looks down at his hands.
insert, Bruno's two strong hands - as he holds them palms tilted upward and fingers curled in.
close up," Bruno, as he smiles faintly, glancing across at Miriam."
close shot," With a studied movement, Bruno picks up the handle of the hammer and swings. "
close shot, The register shoots up to the 100 mark and rings the bell.
boy's voice,"Come On, Miriam. Come On!"
medium shot," Miriam and her companions are escorted to a small boat with electric motor. Once they are seated the boat chugs away from the landing stage and off into the darkness.  Bruno steps into the foreground and gets into the next boat which floats alongside. He, too, moves away into the darkness.  ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL  As Miriam's boat passes through, she gives another little glance over shoulder before her boat disappears into the darkness of the tunnel.  After a brief moment Bruno's boat comes into the picture, and it, too, goes into the tunnel."
miriam," George, stop it, I tell you!"
miriam," George, no!"
george's voice,Miriam!
miriam,Oh!
bruno,Is your name Miriam?
miriam, Why yes. How did you --
close shot, Miriam's glasses hit the ground. The shadows of their struggling figures over the shot.
close up,"The screen is filled with one of the lenses  of the glasses. They are of the diminishing type. Against   the moonlit sky we see reflected, the elongated struggling  figures, as though we were shooting up at them. Suddenly one   of the figures falls forward."
close up," Miriam's head drops into the picture by the glasses.  Bruno's hand comes into the picture and picks up the glasses. One of the lenses has been broken by Miriam's fall.  As we see Bruno's sport shoes move away, the CAMERA MOVES PAST MIRIAM'S HEAD until it comes to Guy's lighter pressed into the earth."
voices,Miriam!   Miriam! Where are you?
medium shot," Bruno comes to the shore where his boat is moored. He gets in and is quickly chugging away. He moves calmly, matter-of- fact and not furtively."
voices,"Hey, here she is! What's the matter with her? Has she fainted?"
voice, She is dead!
other voice, Help! Help!
boatman,Got a cop!  The assistant runs off out of the pictures
blind man,Thanks.
close shot, The feet opposite Guy stretch out and touch Guy's feet.
collins,"There was a man, now please take note. There was a man who had a goat. He loved that goat, Indeed he did. He loved that goat, just like a kid.  What is your opinion?"
guy, You'll never make the Metropolitan.
collins, Name's Collins. On sabbatical - Delaware Tech. Glad to meet you. I jus' gave a speech in New York. On integration. In the differential calculus a function is given and its differential is obtained. Understand?
guy," Sure, I understand."
collins, Y'do?
lap dissolve to:,The taxi comes to a side street and stops outside a small apartment house.
voice, Guy!
voice,"Over here, Guy."
two shot,Guy frowning in puzzlement as he looks at Bruno.
bruno," Hello, Guy."
guy, What are you doing here?   At this time of night?
bruno," You don't seem very pleased to see me, Guy."
bruno, I brought you a little present.
guy,What do you mean?
insert, Guy's hands taking Miriam's glasses from Bruno.    One of the lenses is broken. 
guy,What's this all about?
bruno,Recognize them?
bruno,"It was very quick, Guy. She wasn't hurt in any way. It was all over in no time."
bruno's voice," I know you'd be surprised. Nothing for us to worry about. Nobody saw me, only Miriam."
bruno,"I was very careful. Even when I dropped your lighter there, I went right back to it up. If It'd been found, it would have ruined our whole scheme, wouldn't it?"
guy,"Are you trying to tell me you've -- Why, you maniac!"
bruno," But, Guy, you wanted it! We planned it on the train together, remember?"
bruno,Where are you going?
guy,"Where do you think I'm going? I'm going to call the police, of course. BRUNO But you can't, Guy. We'd both be arrested for murder."
guy,We'd both be arrested for murder?
bruno,You're is much in it as I am. We planned it together. Criss-cross. I do your murder --
guy, You crazy fool! You think you can get away with that?
bruno," Oh, come now, Guy. Why should I go to Metcalf and kill a total stranger, unless it was part of the plan and you were in on it? You're the one that benefits, Guy. You're a free man. I didn't even know the girl."
guy,"Let me go, Bruno. I had nothing to do with this and the police will believe me."
bruno," If you go to the police now, you'll just be turning yourself in as in accessory. You see, you have the motive.  At this moment both turn at a sound across the street."
guy,My telephone.
bruno," Someone has some news for you, Guy."
two shot, Bruno pulls Guy back further into the shadows. Guy instinctively flattens himself against the wall. He looks across the street again.
bruno,"Tell them you know about it already, Guy."
guy," You've got me acting, like a criminal, you crazy fool!"
bruno,Don't you call me that.
bruno,"You must be tired, Guy. I know I am. I've sure had a strenuous evening."
bruno,"Now look, Guy, about my father. I have the plans made. Two plans. A plan of the grounds and a plan of the house. I have in old Luger I bought at a pawn shop in San Francisco. My father --"
two shot, Bruno follows Guy and we FOLLOW them across the street. CAMERA ON THEIR BACKS. Guy strides ahead to the house. 
bruno,"Wait a minute, Guy. To have to talk. We have to arrange things."
guy, Get away before I give you what you gave Miriam.
bruno," You're not yourself, Guy. You're tired. When you think things over, you'll see I'm right. Tomorrow --"
guy, I don't know you. I never saw you before. I never want to see you again.
bruno, But we have to --
guy," Anne darling, you're trembling."
anne,Guy --  I wonder if you know how much I love you.
guy, Brazen woman. I'm the one to say that.
anne, Before we go into the living room.  Father wants to see you.
closeup guy," He looks apprehensively in direction of the living room, conscious of what the news is to be, but covering up.  LONG SHOT LIVING ROOM FROM GUY'S VIEWPOINT  SENATOR BURTON and BARBARA BURTON are seated near a desk on the farthest side of the room. Senator Burton is a distinguished fifty, a man with great pride in tradition, his family and his career. Barbara, Anne's younger sister, is a lively seventeen who loves excitement, says exactly what she thinks and rarely thinks before she says it. Superficially, in height and figure, she resembles Miriam. She also weirs glasses. By her gestures we gather she is speaking urgently, but softly, to her father, who lifts a weary hand to quiet her as she looks toward Guy in the hallway, Barbara keeps quiet and also looks toward Guy. They both wait for him to enter."
closeup guy, He steels himself for the long walk across the hall and the living room.
closeup anne, Watching Guy closely.
guy," Good evening, sir.   Hello, Babs."
barbara,"Something awful has happened, Guy."
senator," Sit down, Barbara."
senator," There seems to be no way of diplomatically breaking tragic news. I'm sorry, Guy, to be the one to tell you. It concerns your wife. She's been murdered."
barbara,The police have been using everything but radar to locate you.
senator,You're to call Headquarters at Metcalf.
guy,Miriam...murdered.
anne, She was...strangled.
senator," It happened on an island in an amusement park. It was sort of a lovers lane, I believe. A rather sordid atmosphere."
barbara, Miriam went there with two boys. They were the ones who found her. So they're not suspects. But you probably will be.
senator,"Young lady, we can't overlook the fact that murder is at our doorsteps. But I forbid you to drag it into the living room!"
barbara," Let's not fool ourselves. The police will say Guy wanted Miriam out of the way so he could marry Anne. In a crime of this sort the police first go after the husband, and Guy had every motive."
senator, Motive?
guy, She's right. Whichever way you look at it...I'm in a spot.
senator," Oh come now, my boy. I'm sure you have nothing to worry about."
barbara, If he hasn't an alibi for nine-thirty tonight he has plenty to worry about.
anne," You can tell them where you were, can't you, Guy?"
guy, At nine-thirty I was on the train from New York to Washington.
senator," There you are. BARBARA Who saw you? Did you speak to anyone? You'll need a Witness, you know."
guy," Yes, I spoke to someone."
senator, Anyone you know?
guy,No. His name was Collins.   He is a professor.
senator, Harvard.
guy,University of Virginia.
anne,Then everything's's all right.
barbara,"Not quite. Detectives play a game called Motive, Motive, Who'd got the Motive."
anne, I'm sick of hearing that word!
barbara,He'll still have to answer questions. SENATOR Routine.   Pure routine.
guy,I'm afraid there'll be a lot of reporters at your front door in the morning.
barbara,Daddy doesn't mind a little scandal. He's a senator.
anne," It can't be helped, darling. It is not your fault. It's not as though anyone can say you had something to do with it."
guy,Someone might say it...I'd do anything to keep you all out of this mess.
senator,"Profit by my experience, Guy. Never lose any sleep over accusations.  Unless they can be proved, of course. We'll help all we can. Dreadful business, dreadful. That poor unfortunate girl."
barbara, She was a tramp.
senator, She was a human being. let me remind you that even the most unworthy of us has the right to life and the pursuit of happiness.
barbara," From what I hear, she pursued it in all directions."
senator,"Barbara! ANNE Father, it's getting terribly late, and Guy looks so tired..."
senator," Of course, of course.    Back to bed, Barbara."
barbara," Well, you two. Nothing stands in your way now. You can be married right away. Think of it -- you're free!"
senator, One doesn't always have to say what one thinks!
barbara," Father, I'm not a politician."
senator,"You won't forget that call, Guy? Captain Turley."
guy,Yes sir.   Goodnight.
barbara,I still think it would be wonderful to have a man love you so much he'd kill for you. 
anne,"I told myself over and over I was being silly, but there was one horrible moment tonight when the news came through. I kept remembering what you shouted telephone from Metcalf."
guy,That I could strang...
anne,"Don't even say it.   Forget you ever said it. Even more   terrifying than the murder itself,  Guy, was the awful thought that if you  had anything to do with it we'd be  separated, -perhaps forever. I'd never   see you again. I couldn't bear it."
guy,Captain Turley is expecting me.   Guy Haines.
sergeant,"Just a moment, Mr. Haines."
closeup guy, He now has time to take stock of the waiting people.    He catches his breath when he sees:
closeup guy, Guy nods in returns.  MED. SHOT  The two boys who were with Miriam at the amusement park. They look at Guy with interest.
sergeant's voice,"Will you come in, please, Mr. Haines?"
captain turley,"Good of you to be so prompt, Mr. Haines. This is Lieutenant Campbell. "
captain turley,"I know you're a busy man, so   we won't detain you any longer than necessary...Now you already been good enough to tell us where you were last evening, and we've managed to locate the gentleman you spoke with on the train."
guy, Yes. I saw him outside.
campbell," Will you come in please, professor?"
closeup guy, He looks up eagerly.
turley,"Professor Collins, this is Mr. Haines. He was with you on the train last night."
collins,"I'm terribly sorry, but I really don't remember meeting this gentleman."
closeup guy, Surprised.    His confident expression fades.
collins," Unfortunately, I remember very little about the journey from New York...You see, there had been a little celebration --"
guy,But we were sitting opposite each other in the observation car! You were singing a song about a goat --
collins, A goat?
guy, And calculus. You were going over a speech you'd made.
collins,"I was? I'm sorry, Mr. Halnes.  I certainly must have celebrated!   I can't remember you at all."
guy," Captain, is it so important whether or not Professor Collins remember me? Surely, the important thing is that I've been able to name a man who was on the train with me. You've been able to find him. Isn't that proof of where I was at nine-thirty last night? Guy asks this question with a look of near triumph that he has clearly established his alibi."
anne,"Hello, darling. Have you had your dinner?"
guy,On the train.
anne,You weren't in Metcalf all this time? We expected you hours ago.
barbara, I didn't. They sometimes throw a suspect in the can and keep him there all night.
guy," When an alibi is full of bourbon, sir, it can't stand up."
barbara,You mean the professor was boiled?
guy,Completely.    He didn't remember me.
anne,"But, you knew he was on the train! Wasn't that enough to prove you were on it, too?"
guy,Apparently not at the right time. They suggested I could have caught the train at Baltimore after Miriam was murdered. They had it all worked out --  in their timetables.
anne, That's ridiculous. They're acting as if you were guilty.
barbara," Weren't they, daddy?"
senator,I certainly hope so.  What is your next step?
guy," Whatever it is, the police will know it. They gave me a present -- come take a look."
guy, My guardian angel.
barbara, You're being tailed!
guy," As a matter of fact, Hennessy's a very nice fellow."
barbara,Shouldn't we ask him in for Coffee -- or something?
senator,I'll have him called off immediately of course.
guy," I'm afraid where I go, Hennessy goes. Even to the Senate."
senator, Is he likely to -- picket my office?
guy,Very likely.
guy, Then what about practicing? Perhaps I'd better forget Forest Hills?
senator,"My dear boy, wouldn't it look rather -- awkward -- if you suddenly canceled all your plans."
anne,"He's right, Guy. You mustn't do anything that would look suspicious. You've got to carry on as though nothing has happened."
barbara, Escorted by Mr. Hennessy.
randall,"A call for you, Mr. Haines.   They say it is urgent."
guy,Hello --
guy,Must be some mistake.   It wasn't for me.
fade in,EXT. WASHINGTON STREET APPROACHING JEFFERSONS MEMORIAL DAY
guy,"Well, I suppose I was pretty lucky to be seeded fifth, really."
hennessy,I've never seen the Forest Hillss tournament before. I'm looking forward to it.
guy," Do you mean we'll be going there together, Hennessy?"
hennessy,"Oh, don't worry. This thing will be cleared up by that time.  Ever thought of turning professional, Guy?"
guy,"I won't have to do that. When I'm through with tennis. I'll be going into politics, I hope."
hennessy, Politics! It's a good thing for you I don't report that to the chief.
hennessy's voice,If he knew you were getting into that rat-race --
hennessy,-- He'd put ten men on your trail. He says --
guy, Let's take this cab.   It's getting late.
guy,"Pentagon Building, please."
hennessy,"Oh, no, not there! I always get lost."
medium shot," Guy looks off for a moment with set face, then tearing the note into shreds, crosses to a small desk, lights a match and holds it to the fragments, letting them burn and fall into an ash tray.

anne,"Well, we'd better be getting back."
guy,We've actually been alone for an hour. Seems almost indecent. You like?

barbara's voice,Guy!

guy,"Hiya, Hennessy. Won't keep you out late tonight.  With Forest Hills coming up tomorrow, I've got to get some sleep."
hennessy, That's too bad. Hammond takes over in a couple of hours. I'd like to see him earn his salary.
guy,Doesn't that bloodhound over relax? He sticks so close he's beginning to grow on me -- like a fungus.
hennessy, He thinks you're a very suspicious character. He doesn't trust anybody! Not even himself.

senator,"How do you do, sir."
bruno,"I'd like to talk to you sometime, Senator, about my idea of harnessing the life force. It will make atomic power look like the horse and buggy.  I'm already developing my faculty for seeing millions of miles. And, Senator, can you imagine being able to smell a flower on the planet of Mars? I'd like to lunch with you some day soon and tell you more about it."
dowager," So nice to see you, my dear Senator."

closeup barbara, She comes from the same direction that Guy came.   She stops short as she sees:
bruno,"But tell me, Judge, after you've sentenced a man to the chair, isn't it difficult to go and eat your dinner after that?"
judge,"Young man, when a murderer is caught, he must be tried. When he is convicted, he must be sentenced. When he is sentenced to death, he must be executed."
bruno,"Quite impersonal, isn't it, sir?"
judge,"So it is. Besides, it doesn't happen every day."
bruno,So few murderers are caught.
bruno,"No more than anyone else.   No more than you, for instance."
bruno," Oh, come now, everyone's interested in that. Everyone would like to put someone out of the way. Now surely, Madame, you're not going to tell me that there hasn't been a time when you wanted to dispose of someone. Your husband, for instance."
bruno, Are you sure? Do you  mean to tell me there wasn't a tiny moment - when you'd been made really angry? And what did you say?
bruno,"There you are, you see! There you are! All right, now you're going -- to do a murder. How are you going to do it? This is the fascinating part -- how are you going to do it...I didn't get your name?"
bruno,"Mrs. Cunningham, how are you going to do it?"
bruno,"Ah! That's better, that's better. Mrs.....?"
bruno, And then have to walk all that way home?
bruno,"No, I have the best way, and the best tools. "

voices,"Stop him! Help, somebody! Pull him off! Mr. Antony! Mr. Antony!"

As the two groups pass off in different directions, the few people who ran into the scene late are asking the others what the disturbance is. ""What's wrong?"" ""Did she faint?"" ""I didn't see anything."" ""What happened to him?"" ""Somebody hurt?"" But one small figure stands in the clear. It is Barbara, She is still transfixed by what she has seen. Her hands are trembling. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN ON HER. We see that her lips are trembling, too, and in her eyes frightened tears are welling. Her breath is heavy."
senator,I thought he was a bit weird when he arrived. Who is he?
guy,"I hardly know him, sir."
senator,"Get him out of here as soon as you decently can -- will you. This is a nice item for the gossips. First thing you know, they'll be talking about orgies. I'd better get back..."
guy,"Yes, sir."
bruno,What happened? I was on a merry-go- round somewhere. It made me dizzy.
guy," You're a mad, crazy maniac, and you ought to be locked-up! Now will you get out of here and let me alone?"

barbara," He looked at me! His hands were on her throat, but, he was strangling me!"

anne,"How did you get him to do it, Guy."
guy,I get him to do it?
anne,"He killed Miriam, didn't he?   Tell me, Guy!"
guy,Yes.  He's a maniac. I met him on the train going to Metcalf. He had a crazy scheme about exchanging murders. I do his murder and he do mine.
anne," What do you mean -- your murder, Guy?"
guy,"Well, he'd read about me in the paper. He knew about Miriam -- and about you. He suggested that  if he got rid of Miriam for me, I should kill his father."
anne,You must have realized he was talking a lot of nonsense!
guy,Of course! I didn't give it another thought. And now a lunatic wants me to kill his father.
anne, It's too fantastic!
guy," Yes, isn't it?"
anne,You mean you've known about Miriam all this time?
guy,Since the first night.   He gave me her glasses.
anne,Why didn't you call the police?
guy," And have them say what you did -- ""Mr. Haines, how did you get him to do it?"" And Bruno would say we'd planed it together."
anne,"Oh, Guy -- what can we do?"
guy,"I don't know, Anne...I don't know."
guy," You see, Anne, that's why I didn't want you to know anything about this. I wanted to protect all of you -- your father, Barbara. And now that you know, you're acting guilty, too."
anne," Oh, if we could only talk to father or someone about it."
guy,"No, that's no good, Anne. I mustn't drag anyone else into this mess. Come on. Let's go in."

closeup guy, His face is dead.
bruno, I was about to tell you that over the phone. But you came to such a sudden decision. I wondered why.
guy," Since you sent me a key to your house, I decided to use it -- to make a little social call on your father. I thought he'd be Interested to know he his a lunatic son."
bruno,"Then a I correct, Mr. Haines, in assuming that you have no intention of going ahead with our arrangement?"
guy,No intention whatsoever.      I never had.
bruno,"I see. You won't have any further use for the key, then, Mr. Haines.  Thank you very such."
guy,Or this.
guy," I don't know whether it's possible for you to realize it or not. I don't know much about these things, Bruno. But why don't you go someplace where you can get some treatment? Not only for your own sake, Bruno, but you can't go on causing more and more destruction to anyone you happen to meet."
bruno,I don't like to be doublecrossed. 
guy," Well, I guess it's no use, Bruno. We sees to have nothing further to discuss. Bruno goes to the door in silent acquiescence and opens it for Guy to pass through."
bruno,"Don't worry. I'm not going to shoot you, Mr. Haines. It might disturb mother.  I'm a very clever follow. I'll think of something better than that. Much better."

hammond, Wonder where he went?
hammond,We'll probably hear of another dame murdered.
hennessy, Shut up. I'd better contact Metcalf. I should think this calls for more questioning of Mr. Haines.
hammond,Questioning?     Nuts!   Let's take him in.
hennessy,"My dear Mr. Hamond, how many times do I have to tell you that we have nothing conclusive on Haines? There's no evidence that he was ever at the scene of the crime. Can't you get that into your thick head?  Now stay put till I get back."
