vaughn,Come on. You don't owe me anything. I made a choice.
brooke,I've been waiting to show you.
vaughn,"My God, Brooke. It's . . ."
vaughn,You're telling me I stink. Mea culpa!
brooke,No!
vaughn,I'll take a shower.

brooke,And now . . .
brooke, I'm so sorry.
vaughn, Don't be daft. I'm sorry. It's. . .

mia,"Don't start, Vaughn. What kind of a fucking stupid question is that? How's my daughter now that I've walked out on her and her mother and run into the arms of my childhood sweetheart?"
mia,"Jesus  the false caller IDs on your phone. `Office'? I mean please. And remember eye contact? You should try private browsing or at least clear your history every now and again. For someone who's in fucking IT . . . So what now? You want some clothes, your tool box, the toaster: a divorce?"
mia,Have them all. On the house.
mia,"What am I supposed to do now, bastard: tell me, tell me, tell. . ."
satnav voice,"In point two of a mile, keep right . . ."
vaughn,Babe?  Brooke?
brooke,Boo!
brooke,What's wrong?
brooke,Blimey  someone lost their sense of humour.
brooke,I thought you'd be pleased for me. I got a job!
vaughn,That's brilliant. When?
brooke,Start on Monday. It'll be good for us  we can be DINKYs.
vaughn,It's great  really.
brooke,You're hungry. Thirsty? Let me get you a drink. Drink for my king. Then maybe . . .
vaughn,Tell me! For God sake . . .
vaughn,Who did this to you?
brooke,"Does it matter? He was jealous. He's everything you're not. Vaughn? You love me. Baby? You don't need to fear him. They're just scars. Oh God, no. Vaughn? They're just scars for God sake. This is my body!"
brooke,Can you see properly? Can you?  Do you like them?
brooke,"Smart question Vaughn, smart."
brooke,Love me.
brooke,Love me!
brooke,"Love me, bastard! COWARD!"
brooke,It doesn't matter.  Go back to her. Go back to mama. It's where you belong.
brooke,Go forever. Now.
dolores,. . .though normally there's a charge for that.
cy,Of course there is.
dolores,There you go.
dolores, OK.
dolores,Here he is now.  Mo?
dolores,Mo? Mo  could you please just see Mister Caudwell out? He just needs to pick something up.
mo,No sweat Doll.
dolores,Dolores! How many more times?
mo,No worries Doll.
dolores,Sorry mister Caudwell. Mo here will see you out. I have to . . .
cy,OK  thanks.
cy,Thanks.
mo,No sweat.
mo,Wow  that's an old VHS isn't it?
cy,It is indeed. Are we done?
mo,Ain't seen one of those for years. Never used one.
cy,Really.
mo,Wait  I gotta sign you out man. Paperwork. You got the forms?
mo,Sir? You're a knight? The queen dub you or something? If I don't call you sir that doesn't mean I don't respect. It just means I don't call you sir.
cy,Fine. It doesn't really matter. Sorry.
mo,Wait  you're that director.
cy,Can we please just finish up and go. I'm late.
mo,Seriously  I know you. I'm an actor. We met once. Maybe . . .
cy,You've got the wrong man.
mo,No seriously. We met at an audition. You auditioned me.
mo,You must remember. I'm not doing this forever. Got plans to do things. Get my CV together. You must remember.
cy,Like I said . . .
cy,The fuck do you think you're doing?
mo,Take it easy. I'm only asking.
cy,How the hell do we . . .
cy,What the hell are you doing?
mo,Come on man  just a j-peg to let my buddies know I saw you. I photograph everything. Got gigs of shit at home. But you you're the man who directed. . .
cy,A sign or two might help.
mo,Exit? It's cool. Listen we won't do the . . . But slow down: you must remember me. You're  that's it: name begins with C. . .
cy,"OK. What the fuck is the matter with all this? I've got my thing, now I just want to get out of here. Let's sign the papers and I can't quite believe there are papers  and I'm done. Clear?"
mo,Clear. So what's on the  video?
cy,Jesus. Mind my business is on the video. Is that all right?
mo,"It's fine, bro; but hostility ain't working. Not in here."
mo,"It was that show - that play you were directing. Silver something. Shit. Four, five years back. Come on, man  you must remember."
cy,OK. I remember. So can we go now?
mo,"Sure, but look: what's with all the storage. You moving house or something?"
cy,"Something like that. Look: show me the way out of here now, man, or I'll have to speak to your supervisor. What was her name? Dorothy?"
mo,Shit no: Doll's just admin. Works up in the box.
mo,"Dolls in the doll house, doing doll things. Bless."
mo,Whoa. Relax Mister C. Out is way. OK?
mo,"Look I don't want you to mind me talking to you and all. I'm just being friendly: one pro to another.  Come on man. Don't go believing this is my shit, because it ain't. Acting's my shit just like directing's yours. I was born to it  know what I mean? I knew you'd remember. Cy that's it! Cy. Mo."
mo,Well that's better. No need for hostility between pros.
cy, How hard can this be?
mo, Pros or ho's  know what I'm saying.
mo,"What's on the video? None of my biz, I know; but I'm curious."
mo,Yup. Got the old bit.  Ain't you got one online? Mine's online.
cy,Right. Get us the fuck out of here or I'm going to . . .
mo,"Look sorry about that dude, but you need to let me know. That's my simple question: what happened."
cy,What happened?
mo,The audition. I didn't get the job.
mo, Seriously. The Silver thing.
cy,Look I don't know. Actors we would have seen dozens. I mean it was a long time ago. I don't know what you mean `what happened'.
cy,"If you didn't get it, you didn't get it. It's the -  - it's the way of the world, no?"
cy,This is ridiculous.
mo,I know how good you are.
mo,I know your true potential. I know your talent doesn't belong packed up in here. Your greatness. And you've failed.
cy,What are you doing?
mo,You don't think I know how you 
cy," What the fuck business is it . . . If I held an audition you failed four or five years ago I'm sorry. If you're working in here not up in lights, I'm sorry."
mo,You're sorry for yourself. That's in your face.
cy,This is fucking absurd.  Criminal damage. Threatening behaviour.
mo,"Cy  we're done here, seriously. Then I'll sign you out. You can ask about the mobile phone you dropped; but I doubt you can claim it on us. Just tell me why you're all stored up in here. Then . . ."
cy,"Mo, isn't it? What does that mean  `Mo'? In any event I can promise you repercussions. I don't care what you think of me. I won't be treated like this."
mo,Brave Mister Caudwell. Genius. Solid citizen I don't think. Just need to know what you're doing. Then that's the end of it all.
cy,My landlord asked me to move out.
mo,"Couldn't pay your rent. Why don't you just say that. I couldn't pay my rent, Mo. That's fine. It's called la crunch du credit. And here we are."
mo,"We're almost, nearly, seriously out of here, Mister Caudwell."
mo,On timers  saves power. You must know. Auto-ma-tic.
mo,"Time to go home, Cy. My only ask is this. And you don't have to say yes, say anything. All I ask is we do it again."
mo," I know. I know it sounds strange. Bit silly even. But if you just let me run the thing again, this time I'll nail it  swear."
mo, I mean. On a fucking VHS video cassette. Where's Noah when you need him?
mo,"Let's run this again from the top, Cy."
cy,"You'll go down for this. I absolutely swear. I'll report this to the police, your superiors. This is fucking . . ."
cy,You think you can actually DO THIS?! What the fuck. . .
cy,"What the fuck, sunshine. Equity subscriptions lapsing are they?"
mo,"Cy, seriously, man who directed nothing: let's just get this right. Then we can get on with things. You can go back your self-loathing and I can continue my rounds."
cy,What!? Screw you.  FUCK YOU!
cy,What the fuck is the matter with you? Jesus Christ!
mo,"Jesus not in here, bro. Christ a nipple sucked by mugs. One born every minute, tick tock."
mo,OK. So what's the brief?
cy,What?
mo,What's the scenario? Set the scene for me. Point me in the right direction. Even Brando needed goalposts.
cy,Help. HELP!
mo,That's it old fella. Get sorted out. In and out. Let it all be cool.
cy,You'll be missed.
mo,Well not really Mister De Mille. It's just me and Doll today. Cutbacks. Don't ya love them?
mo,"Set me straight, mister director!"
mo,The director's chair.
cy,What the fuck do you want?
mo,"You know what I want. Just like you: another chance. Audition me again, you fucking VHS crumb. Give me my brief. Motivation, reality  the whole bit. Go."
cy,"Do what you want, wanker."
cy,You'll do time. Fucking acting. You'll go down. I'll see to it. Think you can fucking do this.
mo,"Again. The scenario, please Cy. Who am I? What do I want?"
cy,"OK crackerjack. Let's play. You're a fucked up wannabe actor who never was and never will be who works as a security guard in a domestic storage depot. Like most people you can't handle rejection, but I mean you really can't handle it really I mean. It's just . . ."
mo,Good dog. Now. . .
mo,"That wasn't the character I read for, the last one I mean. My agent told me a soccer player who is afraid to tell his team- mates of his homosexuality. He turns to his manager for help, for answers to his dilemma; but in the face of this, of this outrage, the manager who has been like a surrogate father to him for years now turns against him, disgusted that the boy he believed in turned out to be a lamentable sausage jockey. Am I right?"
mo,"I'm right, man. That was the scenario wasn't it. The Silver thing I auditioned for that you turned me down for. Wrong. Ignored me for. Like the loser I was. Wrong. The winner is here. In front of you. So. . ."
mo,Make like a camera.
mo,Noises.
mo,"Without a script this time, note. Ad-libbing, free wheeling improvisazione, herr director!"
mo,Cy. Director. Really.
mo,"So, how was I? How was it?"
cy,You did it. You got the job.
mo,LIAR!
dolores,"Cuppa, Mo? Mo?"

austen vo," Only way you're gonna stop me turning into you is by killing me, brah."
jaden,"Got a better idea, baby blood."
wife,Won't be long.
uri vo,"But now the buck must stop. Exculpation is no longer an option. The state has lied to you, Mrs Pentane, and whatever the consequences, I feel it my duty to put the record straight. Why I feel thus obliged will become apparent should we meet. I leave that up to you."
uri," If we're kindly ready, Mister Tyne."
uri, Nicholas it's really so very simple.
uri,"Alright, alright  thank you Mister Karaczun. This is . . ."
boothy,Has the next of kin been informed?
silk,Not yet sir.
boothy, There's never a good time.
silk,Yes sir.
uri,Our intelligence . . .
boothy,"As the board understood it, the prisoner was verified as the jihadi. There was DNA. . ."
uri,We now believe the evidenced might have been contaminated.
boothy, Was there any form of extraction?
uri,"The suspect revealed nothing of the activities of which he was suspected by the board, sir."
parker,Fruit was not born.
uri,"It was a fruitless interrogation, sir - yes."
boothy,"So not only do we have no further intel about the event, we have another next of kin, a nuclear bloody winter of media fallout and the inevitable Whitehall storm. We also have another body to . . ."
parker,"Liquidate, sir?"
boothy, Stimuli? The usual . . .
uri,We explored the usual routes in accordance with our mandate.
silk, Perhaps he told you nothing because he knew nothing.
uri,"That's likely, yes."
boothy,Likely? Christ! This is the kind of thing the media gorges on for months! We can't . . .
uri,Nicholas Pentane died while engaged in activities commensal with his profession as a freelance reporter from wounds sustained at the hands of insurgent personnel. He died behind enemy lines. He was transported home in a manner befitting a hero. He died while attempting to maintain the integrity and vibrancy of a free press  a press we all. . .
boothy,"Spare me the party line, Uri, for God sake! This'll wiki itself sky high unless . . ."
uri,"It's taken care of, sir."
boothy,We're getting off-message here.
parker,Mission creep.
boothy,"What we're here to establish is how a freelance writer get's wrongly arrested, subjected to  He was as innocent as any of us. Any answers, Uri?"
uri,"Mistakes, happen, sir."
boothy,"The man wrote a column for the Economist, for God sake!"
uri,"The best moles have the best covers, sir. They simply always do."
boothy,"What we also need to establish is whether he was killed deliberately, or by . . ."
parker,"Misadventure, sir?"
uri,"The human body can only take so much, sir. Subjected to a certain level of pressure it buckles. Nicholas Pentane's body simply broke under duress."
silk,The mind-body continuum.
uri,The mind-body continuum.
boothy,So what was going on between the fourth and the seventh?
uri,"I was on holiday, sir."
silk,Ah. Anywhere nice?
uri,"Malaga again, sir. My wife does like it there."
boothy,Well not a bad choice at that time of year. We recommended that to do didn't we?
uri,"You did, sir, yes. Your wife actually sent us the brochure if you recall."
elle,Hello.  Yes.
boothy vo,We actually tried Corfu this year. Not bad  though it could have been warmer.
silk vo,"I can actually recommend Crete at this time of year. A bit populous, but there are places where one can escape the hordes."
boothy,"Oh Lord, Michael; if we left it to you we'll all be holidaying on the Norfolk Broads!"
boothy,What we're left with is something of a mess. I'm sure you agree.
uri,Sorry sir I don't suppose we could get some . . . I'm . . .
boothy, And some biscuits. The usual. Actually if there are any chocolate digestives.
sharon os, Certainly sir.
uri,"My desire to meet with you arises from a strong urge to inform you of the circumstances under which your husband actually passed away. The fact is, Mrs Pentane, that you have certainly been misinformed."
boothy,Thanks Sharon.
parker, Never can resist the bloody things.
boothy," Make yourself at home, minister."
uri,Bloody hell!
elle,Yes?
elle,Hello?
uri,Mrs Pentane? It's Uri Tallow from the ministry. We spoke earlier?
elle,Ah  yes. Come in.
uri,Mrs Pentane very good of you to see me like this.
elle,Come in Mister Tallow.
uri,It's amazing. Such talent. Me . . .
elle,Can I get you anything?
uri,No  really I'm fine. Thank you.
uri,Such platitudes! Here we are trapped inside a Terrence Rattigan three act . . .
uri,Mrs Pentane. A delicate subject of course. Your husband.
uri,"Good, old fashioned paper. Nothing like it."
uri,Firstly I'm so very sorry for your loss. I know the ministry has informed you that your husband  Mr Nicholas . . .
uri,Misses Pentane the fact is that . . .
uri,The truth is Misses Pentane that . . . I'm here to tell you that . . . Well this may not be what you want to hear but . . .
elle, If you'd kindly hurry. Please.
uri,Misses Pentane I . . .
uri,Misses Pentane . . .
elle,Oh for God sake!
uri,"The fact is that your husband did not die in the manner in which you have been told he died. As I alluded in my letter, my email. . ."
elle,I can't do this now. I'm sorry.
uri,Misses Pentane please hear me. 
elle,"You need to get the hell away from me. Sorry, but. . ."
uri,Misses Pentane the fact is that your husband was subjected to rendition. Not as you may have heard of it but in a form. . .
uri,Whilst in this instance your husband wasn't transported abroad because of logistics.
elle, Logistics?
uri,"He was subjected here, in the United Kingdom to a process designed to get him to confess."
boothy,"What we need to establish, Uri, is whether, having found out "
uri,"He was no longer any use. By that stage his body was, his mind. . .He would never have been able to lead an ordinary life: work, have relationships."
boothy,So you did the judicious thing and disposed of the suspect accordingly?
uri,"Your husband was tortured, Misses Pentane."
uri,These are measures taken occasionally and in conditions of the utmost secrecy against certain suspects accused of terrorism  I'm sure you're aware.
elle,DON'T TOUCH ME!
uri,"This isn't exactly what I came here to tell you, Misses . . . Not entirely. . ."
uri,What I came here to tell you today that it was me. I oversaw the torture and tortured your husband. It was under my ministrations . . .
uri,"It was me, you see. I killed him. An accident. Only so much."
uri,"I know this is a lot to take in, Misses Pentane."
elle,What are you?
elle,I'm calling the police.
uri,That won't help much today.
elle,Fucker! GET THE FUCK OUT!
elle,What do you want from me?
uri,I want. I want. . .
uri,Wait. Wait please.
uri,OK.
elle,Piece of shit-mould. Get out. . .
elle,This is what you fucking want? Fuck. . . Oh Jesus. . .
uri,Yes .
elle,Piece of dogshit . . .
uri,Misses Pentane . . . the exertion. Please . . .
elle,What?  WHAT?
uri,I relieved him of his pain.
elle,Am I expected to admire . . . Leave me alone.
uri,"It's OK. I don't want you to be . . . I'll make up a story. Don't worry.  I do as I'm told, actually. Sometimes . . ."
elle,Get out.
uri,"Don't worry. Mum's the word, Mrs Pentane. I'll take care of everything. Everything. I promise. . ."
ad vo,. . .not that you'll be needing one now that your house assurance is on the house. Cheers!
marlow vo,"My sense of it is, Christie, as I've said, and the reason I feel I failed, really, is that the state must find a way to take responsibility."
marlow vo,"Well I don't know about that. But yes, I'm looking to move out of the legal profession now."
marlow,I know. But look. For me it's this: we send her out to Afghanistan. We tell her to kill people who resisted our invasion. 
marlow vo,"I understand. I understand that when you sign up, you take your chances. You become an organ of the state, and if that state tells you to kill people in its name, it chooses not to call that murder. It chooses then to call you a hero  especially if you die."
marlow vo,"Nation states have always protected themselves from their own imperial absurdities. What would be left if there was no chance of glory? Why would anyone sign up? Look: in war, anywhere, people do what they can to survive. All I can say is that personally, I mean as Shona's brief, I failed to make the court see sense. For me, you know, it's like you can murder in the so called defence of the state but if you kill in the defence of yourself . . .You know it's like, I mean as Shakespeare said `if his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us.'"
caleb,"What the fuck  easy-peasy, ho!"
caleb,"A bitch. I been had by a bitch!  Stand, bitch."
caleb,Well shocky-shocky-shock. Wasn't expecting quite such a welcome.

caleb,"OK. Let's play the you-kneeling -on-the-floor-now game. I liked you down there.  Yesterday, bitch."
caleb,"Now we got some kind of understanding. Some kind of parity goin' down. Name, ho."
caleb,Well well. Now I'm more than
