Speaker,Dialogue
final draft,"February 17, 1989"
sonny, Daddy! I don't want you to go!
felicia," Your father has work to do, Sonny ... but he'll be home soon. And we'll all watch it together."
sonny,"You promise, Dad?"
storm,I promise.
sonny,"Daddy ...  Daddy, is E.T. gonna win?"
storm,He's got my vote.
felicia, I want you back early. Tonight's the night those little starlets are crawling all over town.
storm,Don't worry. I'll beat 'em off with a stick.
sonny,Daddy  What about my joke?
storm,Knock knock.
sonny,Who's there?
storm,Old lady.
sonny,Old lady who?
storm,I didn't know you could yodel.
felicia, Take my advice: Don't give up your day job.
storm, Karl ... wake up.
karl," I'm here, Mase. Where are you"
storm,On the Harbor ... south of Torrance. I got Calabrese right in my gunsights.
storm,"If I had a Sidewinder missile, I could save the taxpayers a lot of money."
limo," veers toward an upcoming exit ramp.  STORM  Here he goes. I'm shutting down the radio, partner."
storm's car," pulls up at a distance, deep in shadow."
on storm," Moving carefully onto the wharf, keeping to shadow, using cover."
storm,"Let's go, boys.     I'm missing the Oscars."
shack," One man crosses under the eave of the shack -- reaches up, SMASHES the single LIGHT BULB. The spot goes dark."
with storm," Seeing the doors open on both cars. A mature man, CALABRESE, and his stocky confederate, VITALE, step from the limo. TWO other MEN -- one wearing a stylish hat, the other bareheaded -- step from the wagon. They cross to the shadowed, shack area.  STORM  I know you, Calabrese. But who are these mystery guests?  The two Shadow Men are obscured by the shack and the position of Calabrese and Vitale."
storm," Starts his camera soundlessly whirring. He positions his high-tech directional mike, slipping on earphones."
calabrese,"-- Murder is a serious business, my friend. And an expensive one."
calabrese,Slowly ... slowly. Always with caution.
calabrese,All I'm counseling is a little patience. The man is public. He's in the paper every day.
on storm," He squints over the camera, straining to see with the naked eve Frustration"
vitale,We'll do it.
storm, Who are you? Get out of those shadows --
storm," ducks quickly back out of sight. As he does this, his earphone cord catches on something. yanking the phone off Storm's head. He cannot hear what the conspirators say next -- but the audience can."
conspirators," SHADOW MAN WITH HAT The job is a light plane ... a Lear P61. We want it to take off -- we don't want it to land.  Calabrese becomes aware of Mikey checking out the noise; he motions the conspirators to shut up, then signals Mikey to proceed. Mikey cocks his pistol, moves swiftly toward the line of containers."
storm, A quarter's a quarter.
calabrese,Mikey! Quit playing with yourself back there.  Mikey --
storm," bolts back up the wharf, toward his car."
trent," moves INTO FRAME beside Calabrese. The Bareheaded Shadow Man with him is Police Captain DAN HOLLAND  -- 21 years on the force, hard as nails. "
conspirators' pov," They see Vitale pull up, on foot, as Storm's CAR ROARS OFF into the darkness. Vitale seems close enough to pick out the license number."
trent," Whoever that sonofabitch is, I don't want him to get an hour older."
calabrese,"He won't, Mr. Assemblyman."
calabrese's limo," speeds up beside the conspirators. Calabrese gets in, the limo whips off down the wharf to pick up Vitale and take off after Storm."
dunne,Karl -- Storm on three.
karl,You throwing away dimes now?
storm,"This doesn't go out over the air, pal. For your ears only."
karl, What's going down?
storm,Calabrese. I just got his ass -- on candid camera.
karl,You're full of shit!
storm,"Him and his gorilla Vitale. I got film and audio on both of them, laying out a hit. Two other guys I couldn't make out, but I'm sure they'll come up on the film. This is a big one, Carlito. Our own academy award. You ready?"
karl, Shoot.
storm,"I want you to track down Morgensteen right now. If he's with that meter maid from Pico, crank her legs apart and pry him out of there."
karl,He ain't gonna be happy.
storm,"Screw his happiness. Tell him I want the lab open at six-thirty tomorrow morning. I want this film pushed to the max, and nobody but us to know about it. I know we got something here."
karl,You bringing it in tonight?
storm,I promised my kid I'd be home. I'll be at the lab before dawn.
storm,How ya doing?  Got any champagne?
counter man,Right next to the caviar.  There's some in the big cooler.
storm,You're not watching the Oscars?
counter man,The Oscars?    I hate the Oscars.
counter man,Who needs the goddam movies? I get it all in here every night.  Horror. Sex. Freaks. Violence. And I ain't gotta pay no four bucks.
storm, You got a phone back there?
counter man,Why ?
storm, Punch nine-one-one.
counter man,Sonsofbitches! You creeps ripped me off two weeks ago!
shotgun punk,Shut up.
counter man,"Take it, man.   Take my life's savings."
counter man,Where is a cop when you goddam need one?  I got half a mind to come out there and teach you sonofabitch --
shotgun punk,"Now you got half a mind, old man."
shotgun punk,"What are you grinning at, pindejo?"
storm,We ... ell ... there's only three of you and you only got one shot left.
storm, I know what you're thinking.    I have this big shotgun and all   you have is that little icepick.    Mine's bigger than yours. It's not    fair.
storm,Still not fair?
storm,"Don't wait for the blindfold, maricon."
storm,I just got these new glazer bullets. You know they're almost a buck a pop now?
storm,I know that voice.
storm,Wish I could sleep like that.
felicia,Maybe I can help you.
sonny,"Is that for me, Dad?"
storm,You faker.
sonny,E.T. lost.
storm,Who won?
sonny,I dunno.   Candy.
storm,Candy?
felicia, Mahatma Candy. He was a great man.
storm, You know why E.T. lost?
sonny,Why?
storm,Cause they only let grownups vote. If kids had voted --
sonny, -- We would have gave E.T. everything!
storm,We would have given him everything.
sonny,Yeah.
sonny, Daddy -- tell me a knock-knock.
storm,You know the rules.  One joke a day. I have to make 'em last.  Already Sonny is most of the way back to sleep.   Storm kisses his forehead --
felicia,There's blood on your jacket.
storm,It's okay.   It's not mine.
felicia,"If people knew how sweet you are, they'd never be scared of you."
felicia,I'm not scared of you.
storm,Maybe you should be.
felicia, Why? Are you planning on doing something to me?
storm,"A couple of things crossed my mind, in the car coming home."
felicia, Door's open.
felicia," What?  Storm lunges for his .45 on the nightstand. Suddenly LOUD and VIOLENT CRASH and the bedroom door is kicked in. Two dark figures with shotguns leveled fill the door.  There is an eruption of GUNFIRE and blinding muzzle blast and smoke. In the dim light for a moment we do not know what has happened, then:"
storm's pov," We see one of the assassins thrown backward, jacket blown open at the shoulder.  SWITCH TO:"
little man, Man.
big man, Get to work.
little man, You got the tapes?
big man, I got a shitload of 'em.
trent, I'm sorry ... sorry --
trent,What makes people do this?  Will you tell me? Will someone please tell me?!!
holland, What the hell's I.A. doing up at this hour?
holland,"This is Homicide, not Internal Affairs."
holland,"You and Storm were tight, O'Malley. I'm sorry."
holland,Well.
doctor," emerges from the emergency room.  E.R. DOCTOR Excuse me, are you with the police? "
martha,You're early again.
andy," You won't report me, will you?"
andy, Inquiring minds want to know --
martha,-- Dr. Cannon ordered a glucose drip on Jimmy See. Mack's E.E.G. monitor's developing a nice electronic hiccup -- and your boyfriend...  ... turned his head.
andy, He did?
martha, I thought he was going to sit up. I almost shit!
andy,"Yogi said it ain't over till it's over. Till the fat lady sings. There's life in you, J.D., I feel it. I'll never give up on you, and you'll never give up on yourself --"
andy,Besides ... you've got so much to live for.
andy,Sorry.   I won't be long.
martha,How's the sleeping prince?
andy,Still sleeping.  It's bad enough when it's old people. But a young handsome guy --
martha,"Don't let this job get you, honey. It's eight hours, not twenty-four. Get out, meet somebody ... get laid --"
andy," You can have my orgasms, Martha. I'll make up for 'em later."
storm, -- Nurse ...
jones,Internal affairs. Detective Sergeant Jones.
andy,My name is Andrea Simpson. I'm calling from U.C.I. Medical Center. I'd like to speak with  Captain O'Malley.
jones,"What is this in regard to, please?"
andy,"I have a John Doe coma patient, code access 461 zebra, with instructions to notify upon any change in condition."
jones,What is the change?
andy, The patient has regained consciousness.
jones," I'm sorry, Ms. Simpson. Captain O'Malley is no longer with this division. Let me take your information. Please ... contact no one else on this matter."
storm,Miss ... please ... they won't tell me ... think I'm too disorient --
andy,This is U.C.I. Medical Center. You've been in a coma. Your charts go back for seven years.
storm, Seven... years?
storm,Who ... who knows I'm awake?
andy, You'll be famous!
storm, -- Andy. I don't have the strength to talk much. I'm a cop. My wife ... family ... murdered. That's how I got here. If you don't get me out ... you and I ... good chance ... both be dead.
andy,Please -- you're in no danger here.
storm,Goddamit --  can't stay here. Listen to me -
andy,I'll have one of the aides take you down the hall for hydrotherapy. It'll help you relax.
storm,No --
andy,"Listen... I've got work to do. You're my cutest patient, but you're not my only one."
russ,"Excuse me, Doctor. I have to check everyone on the upper floors.  Can I just get your I.D. --"
danny's pov, He sees Russ's partial body in the doorway up the hall recognizable because of its security uniform trousers. 
danny," reacts as if fearing Russ has had a heart attack. He leaves Storm, rushes forward to investigate. Storm strains to see."
danny," Russ!   Russ, are you --"
andy," backs   through the double doors at the other end of the hall,   trying to balance an overloaded tray of supplies she's   carrying. She and Ford are momentarily in full view   of each other ... but backs turned. Suddenly -- Ford   hears Andy! He spins ... gun ready.  Andy carefully   heads   that way -- the two corpses visible ahead and the   killer   poised to waste her. But she's concentrating   on the   overloaded tray, traveling closer ... closer ...   until   -- she turns off into the medicine room.  Ford swiftly hauls both corpses out of sight."
at elevators," Storm weakly, awkwardly ""rows"" himself toward the elevators with the mop handle. Then using his hands, trying to grasp the wall and push himself along. "
at elevators," Storm struggles to push himself inside. Everything an excruciating effort. The doors slap into his litter, trying to close. Reopen. Close. Reopen. Hindering him as he throws a look toward --"
storm,Sonofabitch!
andy,My God!
storm, -- Help me ...
andy,I'm sorry!    Sorry --
ford," hurtles from the stairwell. In one beat, he takes in the janitor; in the next, Andy and Storm -- down the hall. Ford takes off after them. He's going to catch them!"
janitor," jerks up on the power cord! It whipsnakes down the hall, flaring up, tripping Ford! He sprawls face-first as:"
empty gurney, rolls randomly INTO VIEW across the lot.  HIGH ANGLE - WIDE SHOT - PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAWN  Andy's car speeds up the PCH. Majestic Malibu Mountains visible -- dawn sun shimmering the ocean with early light.
trent, Six gang-related murders in one week. We're going to put a stop to it -- and we're going to start right here!
trent,I'll be talking with the mayor. We'll have a statement shortly --
trent,Holland -- plaster his ass with slime in the press. Put a tail on every person he knows --
holland,"We know how to do our job, Senator."
trent,"Then start showing it.  I'm starring in that sonofabitch's home movie -- and the Oscar is thirty years in the slammer. He's toast, understand?"
trent, We're going to end violence in this state -- and you can take that to the bank!
storm,"Seven years.  He struggles to sit. It takes all his strength simply to get half-propped on pillows. Something jabs him. It's a TV remote, on the sheet beside him. Storm picks it up.  After a beat, he manages to focus on the TV --  TV SCREEN - ""GERALDO SHOW""  -- Stay tuned for more of: Best of Geraldo!"
storm,Geraldo?
tv screen, An attractive female spokesperson speaks directly and sincerely into camera.  FEMALE SPOKESPERSON  -- If you want to sleep with me ... you better wear a Pharoah. 
storm, Certain the world has gone insane.
andy," can't come in to work, are you crazy?! I can't even go to my apartment! People are dead, Martha ... no, I can't tell you where I am ... you're better off not knowing --"
andy," I want to help him... my God, he needs it ... but it's all over the T.V., he's some kind of crooked cop with drugs and murder and --"
andy,"It's okay -- I'm here, I'm with you."
storm, Tell   him it's Storm. Mason Storm.
storm, I can't stay here. They'll trace you from the hospital in two --
andy, Will you believe me?! We're safe here.
storm," Listen, you sonofabitch --"
andy,We'll find your friend O'Malley. We'll just keep phoning ...
storm,Listen.     I'm getting out of here.
andy, I'll buy tickets to that.
storm,I just need some food -- and a few days to get my strength.
andy,Days?   Try a few weeks.
storm,"You helped me, okay? I'm grateful. But every day you keep helping puts you in more danger."
andy, Danger is my middle name.
storm,"I've been dead, Andy.      You wouldn't like it."
andy,"Hey, hey -- I don't think you get the picture here. Your muscles have been getting electronic stimulation at the hospital, but it's not like actually being up and bearing weight."
storm,You're the one who doesn't get the picture. 
extreme closeup," Fury, frustration, despair --"
andy," grabs his arm and helps him back onto the couch. She exits the room and comes back momentarily with a bowl of rice and begins to try to feed him. Of course he takes the fork away and tries it himself, but by now his arms are so fatigued from the previous strain that they shake, his hand trembles and he misses his mouth -- getting the rice all down his beard. Spilling a little too much to ignore and at first it looks like he's going to explode. He looks up at Andy, who looks so sad.  Storm breaks out laughing and so does Andy. They howl together for a while and then settle down. Now Andy begins to ""help"" feed Storm."
andy, Mata Hari -- at your service.
storm,Just some herbs I need for my recovery.
andy,No problem. This is on my list for Safeway every day.
storm, That bad ... huh?
andy,I'll be in the other room.
widen shot," TO REVEAL Trent's office. Trent, Holland and several of Trent's security aides glued to the tube.  ESPOSITO  Storm gave me his word that he is innocent of all charges preferred against him in the press -- and that he has access to indisputable proof of this. Battling the atrophy caused by seven years of hospitalization, Storm is struggling even now to regain the strength that will enable him to come forward with this evidence. He has promised me and the K.A.B.C. audience a first look at his alleged proof. "
trent, I want 24-hour surveillance on this sonofabitch.
dunne,Where out of town is Andy?
martha,I don't know.  You need a warrant to walk in on someone like this. Get the hell out.
martha,Then I'll get out.
ford,"We'll ask you again, Martha:     Where is Miss Simpson?"
martha,I'm calling your superior officers to report this. I want both your names and shield numbers.
martha,Help?   Help me!
montage, WITH SCORE.
andy,That's enough! I don't care how many needles you stick in yourself or how much ginseng root you eat ... you have to sleep if you're going to recover.
storm,I slept for seven years?
andy,That's an order!
andy,Jesus -- what a patient!
andy,-- You can't  compare blood pressure readings now  with when you were in a coma. It's   not going to give a true measure  --
storm,What's this reading?     555 over four digits --
andy,That's crazy --
andy,It's Martha's chicken scratches. Even she can't read 'em.
storm,I'll tell you what it is.     It's a phone number.
andy, I'm. sorry ... maybe I have the wrong number. I'm looking for Kevin O'Malley.
old lady,O'Malley?   There's no O'Malley here.
andy,My name is Phyllis O'Connor. I'm with the pension board of the Los Angeles Police Department. We have a misplaced check here for Captain O'Malley ...
old lady,"A check?  Well, listen... there's a big turnover here, people are dying all the time, I never know who's in what bed. Can you leave me your number?"
andy," I'm sorry, we're not allowed to do that."
andy,"Mrs. Wade, I'll be honest with you -- I'm not from the police pension board. My name is Andrea Simpson, I'm a nurse from U.C.I. Medical Center."
andy,"You probably have no connection to this, and what I'm about to say "
andy,I can't do that.
andy,Can I phone you?
andy," This is my number, Mrs. O'Malley."
andy,Yes ... you're right.    I'm sorry.
andy,"Oh, I'm sorry ... I didn't mean to interrupt. I, ah, well, I was just passing by and ..."
storm, Thanks.
storm,Please.
storm,I'm sorry -- 
andy,"Mason, please  I love you."
storm,Don't say that!
andy,Why not?!
storm,Because I can't love you! Don't you see? It's seven years to anyone else. But it's only days for me.
storm,"How can I be with you ... how can I want you and take you, when --"
storm,"You seduced me. You came in here, looking that way, knowing just what the hell you were doing --"
andy," Yeah, I knew. What of it? I wanted you --"
storm,You have no right to want me!
andy,Then who does?!     I've risked my life for you --
storm,Who asked you to? Not me!
andy,You haven't stopped me!
storm,Then don't risk it! Don't do shit for me! I don't need you!
storm," stands in the midst of the graveyard, staring at --"
three tombstones," In the light from the road lamp, we read the names: FELICIA STORM... MASON STORM ... JEREMY ""SONNY"" STORM. "
andy," Pick up, Martha ... Pick up."
andy,"Get a hold of yourself, Andy."
andy, You're really beautiful.
andy," Martha! Martha, it's me --"
neighbor, You looking for Martha Coe?
andy,Yes... yes --
neighbor,You haven't seen the news?  She's dead. They shot her in the back... over in Westwood.
neighbor, You look like the woman's picture on T.V... the one whose house they shot her at --
ford," Mount up, boys. Two to one she leads us right to our boy Storm."
man,"That's grand theft, auto."
storm, O'Malley.
storm,Where is he now? Is he safe?
storm, Then that was your mother.   The one Andy found.
storm,O'Mal ... I can never thank you.
storm,"I'd give my left arm to see Sonny, just for two minutes. But we can't risk it -- not yet. Not till I get Calabrese."
storm, He did his thing -- then they waxed him.
storm,"The two guys at the pier. They ordered the hit on me too.  And I've got 'em on film. Still in the camera, right where I left it."
storm,Where is the tape?
storm,"What happened, O'Mal?    To you?"
storm," I'm sorry, O'Mal."
storm,"You did the right thing, O'Mal."
storm,"We'll get 'em, buddy. Every fucking one of them."
storm,"Get Sonny out of that school, O'Mal. Right now. With me alive and making a stink, whoever's on that film is going to be looking harder than ever for Sonny -- just to get to me. Get him someplace safe ... three thousand miles away if you have to."
storm,"I'm going straight to get that film. When you've got Sonny safe, bring me the audiotape. We'll put 'em together and get 'em to Esposito for the T.V. news. That should be quite a show."
storm,Gone.  For the best. For her best.
storm," I'm gonna take you to the bank, Senator Trent. The blood bank."
andy,Martha's dead.
andy,I won't leave you. Not ever again.
storm,I won't let you.
storm,O'Malley was here.
andy,Here?   How did you find him?
storm,You found him. The old lady was his mother.  And Andy ... my son's alive.
living room," Ford and Jones, masked, hurtle into the living room, just below the atrium balcony. They raise their automatic weapons, but before they can fire --"
storm," hurls Joe Bear's massive body down upon the attackers! Jones takes the tonnage head-on and is crushed beneath it! Ford dodges, unleashes a burst of AUTOMATIC FIRE straight up at the balcony. Storm shoves Andy to safety onto the exterior balcony and dives there himself, just as the whole interior balcony is RIDDLED by Ford's BULLETS!  Ford bolts for the staircase, coming after Storm. Storm, crouched around the corner on the exterior balcony, waits till Ford hurtles INTO VIEW at the top of the staircase. Storm FIRES his .45 furiously ... Ford springs back, Storm's BULLETS BLAST the staircase WALL to ribbons. His .45 CLICKS empty!"
storm,I know this fuck. He's a cop!
jeep's pov, The heavy iron gate straight ahead.
storm, SLAMS THROUGH the metal GATE with JEEP BLASTING it.
oncoming vehicle," Captain Holland! -- in the car as a passenger, with another plainclothes cop. The flying gate sends glass in all directions, as Storm swerves in his Jeep to avoid the car.  Storm freaks, seeing Holland as Holland's car is forced off the road. Storm SKIDS into a wild 180 -- "
storm, Holland! The other man on the dock --
andy,Are you crazy?!     Get us outa here --
storm's jeep," swerves as BULLETS SMACK into it! Protecting Andy with his body, he races off down the mountain road at high speed."
downfield sidelines," The soccer coach turns back. We see him shout, his arm raised in a gesture of urgency --"
andy,What the hell are you doing?!
storm,"We just made the top of the chart, Andy. Every cop in the city thinks we shot our way out of a legitimate bust --"
andy,There are no cops here!
storm,Only 'cause they're too stupid.  We need that film and we don't need any bullshit --
andy,"Goddamit ... for once, do something the non-violent way!"
housewife,"-- Gee, my husband and I aren't really thinking about selling. In fact, we're adding a nursery --"
andy,"Oh, that's the best time for us to see it! Then when you do come to sell, our office will know the upgrades you've made and we can market your home more effectively."
housewife,"Hell, come on in. Everyone else does."
storm,New wall ... fucking yuppies!
wall," Bang! Gypsum wallboard splinters, revealing a fake panel of brick adjacent to a real brick wall, six inches behind the new wallboard. Storm reaches into the hole, yanks out the camera case. He shakes his sore knuckles from the blow as:"
housewife, Just checking for termites He tucks the camera case under his arm -- takes Andy by the elbow.
storm," Better have this place fumigated -- quick.  He leads Andy out -- crisply, businesslike.    Housewife stands there dumbfounded."
storm," O'Malley left his mother's place three hours ago -- with the tape. He should be at the school by now, but she hasn't heard back from him."
andy, Fuck the tape. We gotta get this film to Esposito or I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown.
storm," Tell O'Mal to leave a message for us at the hotel desk. Leave it for Andy ... Andrea Smith. We're not gonna check in, it's too dangerous -- but the desk will hold the message if you tell them we're coming in this afternoon. Got it? Great."
storm,You're gonna call Esposito.   But not from this phone.
montage," WITH SCORE.    Tension, urgency increasing --"
storm,"Hey, hermano!     You want this Jeep?"
storm,Fuckin' smoking.
andy, Esposito won't be here yet. He said three-thirty.
storm,He'll be there.
storm,"Try O'Malley one more time.  If you hear any lions roaring, haul ass."
storm,Don't worry.   I'm a big boy.
trent,"What a day, huh? Beautiful!  Want some nuts?"
storm,I haven't got the film on me.
trent, Sit down. Take a load off.
trent,"You do have the film somewhere, I assume?"
trent,Developed yet?
storm,Still in the camera.
trent,Good. Very good. That way I know you haven't duplicated it.
storm,"You know, Trent ... I could rip your fucking throat out before that sonofabitch over there could find the spit to sneeze."
trent,"Oh, I'm sure you could, Storm.  But not before one of those other gentlemen, across the way, could put a fifty-caliber slug through your brainpan."
storm,"Very well placed, Trent. But did you know that human reaction time -- even the fastest -- is between half and three-quarters of second? And in that time, I could easily --"
trent,"You could kill me now, Storm -- but you'll die two seconds later."
storm,"You think I care, motherfucker? Just so I get you -- one way or the other."
max dunne," Twenty feet away -- both hands up -- holding a bay's athletic shirt... ""TRINITY VENTURA."""
trent,Reach into my jacket pocket.  Reach in!
trent,I want that film and the tape. I'll give you three hours.
storm, Just tell me one thing. Who pulled the trigger on me and my wife?
trent, Hate poisons people. Let go of it.
dunne, I missed your kid seven years ago. But I won't miss tonight.
trent,"Bring that film, Mr. Storm.    Three hours."
nolan," It's fun, huh, kid? Kinda like a field trip."
sonny,I'm remembering both of you.    And when my dad gets here --
turner,"He's gonna have a long trip, kid -- starting from Forest Lawn."
nolan,"By the time this night's over, your old man'll have a use for that phony grave of his."
nolan,Yeah... yeah -- we'll be right down.
nolan, Don't leave home without us.
sonny's pov, A 30-foot drop to the pavement below.
sonny,Malley!
andy,Is that a steering wheel -- or a Winchell's donut?
sedan, pulls out after it.
jones, I need to check any messages for a Miss Andrea Smith.
desk clerk,I'm sorry. I see no slot for that name --
jones,She hasn't checked in yet. But she's due here. Someone might have left a message for her.
desk clerk,Here it is. There's just one message.
jones,You can put this back now.  You never saw these guys.  The Clerk nervously replaces the message slip.  DISSOLVE TO:
jones, half-hidden at a corner of the cocktail pit..
two plainclothesmen, dispersed at angles across from the message desk.
ford, slips back out of sight.
jones, does the same.
andy,Sonny got away! He's with O'Malley! O'Malley's gat the tape -- they're heading for Union Station.
storm's pov, He spots Ford!
storm, his eyes flash across the lobby. He spots:
storm," shields Andy. Plainclothesman #1 steps out, whipping out his badge. Suddenly Storm grabs the cop with the badge in front of his face and uses him as a human battering ram for him and Andy to escape, plunging the man through two layers of glass windows of the adjoining Hertz rental office and out into the street in front of the hotel! Andy follows through the newly formed exit. People scream. Chaos. The other cops react in pursuit of Storm and Andy."
valet area," The valet is a big fat man in a red Beefeater costume. He is presently handing keys to a large ""good old boy"" -- boots, ten-gallon hat and all. Tex is just laying a bill in the Beefeater's hand, and starting to stuff his too- large frame into a sleek Gullwing speedster with its doors popped up. Before he can, we see him take a flying seat on the road as Storm and Andy shove in and -- "
ford,Get the goddam cars!
sonny,"Quit it, will you ...    you're making me more nervous than    I am already. My father's going to    be more interested in seeing    the real me."
sonny,My dad'll get 'em. You guys'll nail them all.  You think he's gonna like me?
sonny,Let me see the tickets. Did you get us one of those sleeping cars? What time is he getting here anyway?
nolan, Taking a trip somewhere?
nolan,"Your son, huh? That's funny.     He doesn't look much like you --  Does he, Turner?"
turner,Looks a lot like Mason Storm.
nolan,Enough of this fucking around.    We want the tape.
nolan,Get the kid!     He's under the cars!
turner,"Give us the tape, kid -- and we'll take you home."
sonny,"Fuck you, Jack!"
on sonny, unaware of Storm -- trying to escape from his pursuer.
nolan, cursing and unable to gain ground on the fleet-footed -- now actually raising his gun. Suddenly:
storm, from the roof of the next-to-last car roof in a line of parked vehicles soars through the air like a night eagle- setting what looks like a new world record in the long jump -- surprising Nolan from the rear! Slamming the cop to the ground in instant death. Cracking his neck.
sonny," stops. Gasping, breathless -- seeing the father he hasn't seen in seven years."
storm," relieved and overwhelmed, grabs his son and lifts him off the ground in a moment of salvation and triumph. They hold each other with all their strength. "
andy, watching them.   Touched deeply. Then: O.S. SIRENS!
driver,Where to?
andy,That's a good question.   Out of here for sure.
sonny, Where are we going? Who are you?
andy, thinks for a moment. 
andy,It's a long story. You got a few minutes?
storm," swiftly sliding through the shadows, he moves around the perimeter, pausing to examine things, searching for something. He finds an old storm gate to what would probably be a cellar or basement."
dunne," What do we have to do, Holland drive a fucking stake through his heart?"
holland,I'll settle for a bullet.
holland,"You had him point-blank seven years ago, and he's still walking!"
ford,He won't be for long. Not with his picture on every T.V. in --
holland,Fuck his picture! Get off your asses --  Start earning your money!
storm," Out of nowhere appears at the door opposite the one Holland just left by.  He is dripping from the rain and has a .45 pointed at them with one hand, while with the other he holds a finger to his lips as if to say, ""Shhh, don't wake the baby."""
storm,"How's the action, boys?   Mind if I play?"
storm,I know what you guys are thinking. You're thinking I couldn't play with this gun in my hand. Right?
storm,Well?   Somebody hand me a cue.
storm,That's for my wife. Fuck you and die.
trent,I want Dunne and the others here. That goddamn Storm is nuts enough to come after me --
holland,He's nuts -- but not that nuts.
holland," A faint smile comes to his face with great confidence. As he backs out of the toilet, he pulls his pistol from his shoulder holster, cocking it. He cautiously exits."
tracking, Holland as he   moves toward the sporting room   and his support team.    He enters the area of carnage   and the smug confidence on   his face starts to change to a   slight worry. He then starts   carefully making his way back   to the indoor pool to inform   Trent.
holland,Sonofabitch.
storm,I'll give you more time than you and Trent gave my wife.
storm,"Vernon, oh, Verrrrrnon, where are you?"
storm, Let's see ... where could that bad boy be?
master closet, Storm enters and begins pushing the clothes of the racks aside -- looking for something that's probably not there. Trent is too smart for this shit ... he's probably on a jet to the Bahamas by now. 
storm,"You know, Trent, I want to kill you so bad I can barely contain myself. But I keep thinking that death is far too merciful a fate for you, and that a nice petite white-bread boy like you in a federal penitentiary ...  -- let me put it this way -- I doubt whether you could remain anal retentive for very long. Yeah... I think that's best for you --"
full shot," Now we see them fully: the colors, the feeling, the emotion of caring men marching in the funeral parade of a fallen comrade.  CAMERA PAN'S OVER to reveal a section of mourners -- mostly police but with some civilians. The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER and PANS TO the front row, where we see Storm in full police regalia, a medal of valor around his neck. Andy and Sonny are standing near at sober attention.  The procession stops and the lone bagpiper continues to play the dirge as he walks up and takes his position on a section of lawn. The pallbearers remove the flag from the casket and present it to the Chief of Police, who now slowly approaches the group of mourners and stops directly in front of Sonny Storm. He presents the flag and salutes Sonny. The lone bagpiper stops and an officer on TRUMPET begins playing ""Taps."" The coffin is slowly lowered."
andy, It takes a beat before she realizes what it is. Then: 
andy,"Hey ... Seven year Storm!  I told you you'd be famous.  Storm takes a step so he can see the screen.   Views it for a short beat, then --"
storm," picks the TV up from Andy's lap and, while it's still playing, heaves it over the side and into the drink!"
andy, Hey!   Why'd you do that?
storm," Knock, knock."
sonny,Who's there?
storm,Boo.
sonny,Boo who?
storm,You don't have to cry about it.  I love you both.
boat, drifts its happy way across the sun-shimmering sea.  FADE OUT.
