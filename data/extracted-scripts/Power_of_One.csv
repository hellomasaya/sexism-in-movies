9.,"as another student painfully tattoo-scars his arm with a swastika, using a knife and blue dye. Seeing the six- year-old, Jaapie turns his attention to him and addresses him in Afrikaans."
jaapie,God has sent Hitler to deliver us from the English bastards who stole our country and killed our people. Heil Hitler! The other boys chorus in.
all,Heil Hitler!
jaapie,We will swear a blood oath. When Hitler comes we'll rise up and kill the Verdomde Rooineks.
all,"A blood oath!    A blood oath! Jaapie bends down and grabs the six-year-old by the shirt front, yanking him up."
jaapie,With your blood.
jaapie,We swear allegiance to Adolf Hitler. Heil Hitler!
all,We swear allegiance to Adolf Hitler. Heil Hitler!
jaapie,Death to all Englishmen in South Africa. Heil Hitler! The chorus repeats.
jaapie,God bless the fatherland.    Heil Hitler!
10.,ALL Heil Hitler!
jaapie,"See what we have in store for you when Hitler comes, Rooinek. Hoy!"
boy,No!
jaapie,"For crimes committed against the whole Boer people. I, Jaapie Botha, the judge and Uberfuhrer, sentence you and your Rooinek kaffir chicken to death. Heil Hiter.!"
all,Heil Hitler!
all,"Heil Hitler!   Heil Hitler! The SLING WHISTLES through the air, faster and faster."
boy,"No! Jaapie releases the stone. It flies true, catching the SQUAWKING, struggling CHICKEN flush in the chest. The flapping stops as blood soaks through feathers."
11.,"Jaapie flings his hand forward, victorious."
jaapie,Heil Hitler!
all,Heil Hitler!
jaapie,Hang him up!
boys,Jaapie!   No!
jaapie,Hang him!
jaapie,"You will pay for the deaths of our grandfathers and grandmothers, our aunts and uncles. All Rooineks will pay and you will be first. Pull!"
jaapie,"In the name of Adolf Hitler and the fatherland, I sentence you to die, Verdomde Rooinek."
12.,BOYS Kill him!   Kill him!   Kill him!
staff member,What's this?
pk,"I came to after being unconscious for two days, the rock missing my eye by half an inch. After a week in hospital it was decided I'd be sent to my grandfather's house in the English town of Barberton, at least until passions at school cooled. Jaapie Botha was expelled; sent home to his family's farm in disgrace."
13.,glasses off and wipes the lenses deliberately.   After a long moment he turns to face the class.
pk,"Thank you, sir."
14.,"Oxford selection committee. You are to appear before them in three weeks. I assume you'll be reading a piece of your fiction as your presentational. PK Yes, sir."
pk,"Yes sir. I will.  Will the scholarship be decided at the same time, sir?"
pk,"Very good, sir. St. John picks up a book and opens the pages. He begins to read. PK takes it as a cue for his dismissal. He goes to exit."
pk,"Thank you, sir."
15.,PK How we doing?
morrie,"You win and your dream comes true. You lose, we're back to bread and butter sandwiches till term's end. What'd he want? PK My appointement before the Oxford committee came through."
morrie,A snap.
pk,"For a brain like you, maybe."
morrie,"Come on, you'll read one of your pieces, they'll be begging you to attend."
pk,But will they pay for the privilege?
morrie,Well let's bloody hope so. It'll be a lonely time without you there.
pk,Morrie Levy. Is that the voice of sentimentality I hear coming from you?
morrie,Sentimentality my ass. Practicality. Where am I going to find a sure thing like you to make book on at bloody Oxford?
pk,Go on.
16.,22   INT. LONG HALLWAY - CLOSEUP - PK AND MORRIE           22
morrie,You hear Sutcliffe screwed Bartlett's sister when he stayed with them over holidays?
pk,I don't believe it.
morrie,I heard it from Bartlett's own lips. He's selling reservations for next holiday. A pound for one night; three pounds for four.
pk,You register? MORRIE For both of us. Took the whole holiday.
morrie,"You nervous? PK No. MORRIE Christ! I'm about to have a calf. This bloody Boer gets lucky, we're in the poorhouse. They reach the double doors. Still in CLOSEUP, Morrie turns to face PK for the first time."
morrie,"Now remember. We're not here to exhibit our wares. We go in, we do the job, we get out. Right?"
pk,Right.
announcer,"And at the end of six matches in all weight divisions, the score is Prince of Wales three victories, Helpmakeer three victories."
announcer,"And now for the final bout to determine which school will win the Johannesburg 1950 public school boxing team championship. In this corner, weighing 140 pounds, standing 5'8"", from the Helpmakeer School with a record of 13-0 on the year, Jannie Geildenhaus. A huge cheer goes up for JANNIE, muscular, bare-chested, as he dances and shadowboxes for the crowd."
announcer,"And in this corner, representing the Prince of Wales School, the current Johannesburg Public School welterweight champion, also with a record of 13-0 on the year, also 140 pounds, Kid P.K."
announcer,"We thank the native population for their spirited display of enthusiasm. But now, on to the main event. Fighters to center ring, please."
referee,"You both know the rules.     No butts, no elbows, no low    blows. First man to score three    knock downs wins. Let's have     a good clean fight. Good luck     to you. The fighters slap leather. PK turns back to his corner when his focus is broken dramatically by a face in the crowd."
morrie,"We're in a bloody war here, in"
19.,"case you forgot. Let's keep our mind on that, hey?"
jannie,Blery Rooinek.     I'll kill you.
morrie,Up!   Up!
referee,Okay.   Fight.
morrie,Christ! If they get caught in here they're dead.  What the hell's going on?
pk,I don't know.
morrie,"Well, worry about it later. In case you haven't noticed, this Boer bastard is trying to kill you."
pk,You see the way he drops his left when he throws the right?
morrie,Yeah?
21.,29   ANGLE ON MORRIE                                            29
morrie,"Thank you, God."
morrie,"Here you go, pal. He hands PK the money."
pk,You're the treasurer of this company. You hold it. Did you find out what I asked for?
22.,"Uh, listen, P.K. You know in this world there is no greater proponent of sins of the flesh than Morrie Levy. But  do yourself a favor on this one.  Take my advice. Pass. PK Thanks for the advice.    The information please."
morrie,Do you know who her father is? Professor Daniel Marais. PK So?
morrie,"So? He's the Nationalist Party's resident intellectual. The man is one of the architects of this damned system of -- what are they calling it? -- apartheid? He has about as much use for a Rooinek Englishman rutting after his daughter as the Queen does for balls, pardon my French."
pk,What's her name and where do I find her?
pk,You going to take book on that?
morrie,Already have.    Three-to-one says you don't.
pk,Where'd you bet?
morrie,I took a big position you do.
morrie,In case you have to bail yourself out.
pk,May I come in?
pk,I'm sorry to scare you. MARIA  You can't be here.
pk,I didn't know how else to meet you.
maria,I could be expelled.
25.,Girls don't usually come to boxing matches.
maria,We went on a dare. Please. PK ignores her anxiety.
pk,Did you like it? MARIA It was...  ... exciting.    You were very good.
pk, Thank you. I'm glad I impressed you.
maria, You speak the Taal.
pk,I'll speak Zulu if it'll help me see you again. MARIA I can't.
pk,Why not?
maria,I need my father's permission.
pk,Is it hard to get?
maria,Hard for an Afrikaaner boy. Impossible for an English one.
pk,How about your permission?    Do I have that?
26.,GIRL #1 We're having coffee upstairs. Want to come?
maria,I have to finish this paper.
maria,Please go.
pk,You didn't answer my question. MARIA There are plenty of English girls. What makes me so important?
pk,The way I felt when I saw you.
pk,I can't wait.
maria," Good night, PK."
27.,PK pauses.
pk,I don't remember telling you my name. MARIA  And I don't remember telling you mine. PK smiles back at her. He drops to the ground. Maria closes the window and watches him scoot across the campus until he is swallowed by the night.
pk,My people?
marais,The English.
pk,"I consider myself an African, sir."
marais,"As do I. As do the Zulu, the Xhosa, the Pongo, the Ndebele. We're all Africans. But all from separate tribes, ay?"
marais,"Why do you say that? PK Because it's the whole tribal idea that creates our problems here in South Africa. MARAIS The problems of South Africa, my boy, do not come from tribalism. They come from counter-tribalism. From people insisting that natural laws which have been in place and operating since God's creation, should be tampered with. Does the gazelle sleep with the lion? Does the rhino graze with the mouse? The separation of things is not coincidental. Do you think a Zulu wants to see his culture, his sense of identity, replaced by someone else's anymore than I do?"
pk,"No, sir. But I don't think he wants being a Zulu to mean he is denied the same rights as everyone else has."
marais,Which is why civilization is defined by the ability to live under the rule of law. Laws define rights.
pk,"But do they define justice? MARAIS Ah. Justice. The banner behind which the English marched as they gobbled up a quarter of the world? Justice, my boy, is only relative to who's in charge."
pk,And how long they stay in charge is only relative to how well they dispense that justice...  ... with all due respect.
maria,"Papa, would you like coffee in the library or the parlor?"
marais," The library, mein leib."
marais,"I can't figure out if you're brave or foolish. PK Why is that, sir?"
marais,You come here to ask for permission to see my daughter. Correct?
pk,"Yes, sir. MARAIS And knowing  who I am, what I stand for, do you  think this sort of discussion  is going to put that request in  a favorable light?"
pk,I thought a man of your intellectual reputation wouldn't want his daughter seeing someone who didn't think.
marais,"Let me give you some advice then. You're right. I admire a keen mind.  But intellectual reputation or not, I am first a Marais, a member of the Volk."
30.,PK These ideas I picked up somewhere else.
doc,"This I do not normally without permission do, ja? But to catch the expression. After all, it is the expression that is important. Ja? Without the expression the human being is just a lump of meat. You have some problems, I think. I am Professor Karl von Vollensteen."
pk,I'm P.K.
doc,Such a young person with such an
31.,old expression. I think we can be friends. Ja?
doc,"The brain, P.K., has two functions. It is the best reference library ever, which is a good thing to have. Ja? But also from it comes original thought. In school you will get all filled up with the facts. Here your brain will learn where to look, how to look, how to think. And then you will have for yourself all the brains that have ever been."
doc,But it harms no other plant.   It
33.,"has patience and solitude and modesty. In Mexico there is a cactus that blooms once in a hundred years and then only at night. That is saintliness of the highest order I think. Ja? From cactus comes medicine to heal the wounds of men and little buttons if you eat one you can touch the face of God or stare into the mouth of hell. It is the plant of patience, solitude, love, and madness. Modesty, beauty. Toughness and gentleness. Of all the plants I think it is closest to God. Ja?"
doc,"Everything fits, P.K. Nothing is unexplained. Nature is one big chain reaction. Everything depends on everything else. From the smallest to the biggest. Always in life an idea starts small like a tree."
doc,"P.K., if there is one thing I know you to be that is a lot more than just satisfactory. Ja?"
pk,But I don't want to be known as a brain.
doc,Why not?
pk,"Who do you think gets beaten up on all the time in school? DOC My boy, to be smart is not a sin. But to be smart and not use it, that is sin number one. And as for getting beat up on, use your brain to figure out how not to be. He hands PK the report card, his displeasure obvious. As they crest the hill the cottage comes INTO VIEW along with a parked Army car and two armed soldiers leaning against it. Seeing Doc and PK, the soldiers smarten up, raising their rifles and advancing."
doc,Again it begins. The stupidity. Do not be frightened.
38.,"MORRIE Look, even if the scholarship doesn't come through, my old man said he'd lend you the money."
pk,Morrie.
morrie,All right. All right. We'll call it the 'Levy Carpet Emporium Scholarship for Poor but Proud Christian Gentlemen.' How's that?
pk,"Tell your father I appreciate the offer. MORRIE God, I hate people who can't be bought."
pk,Why is that?
morrie,I don't know.    Personality disorder.
pk,Undoubtedly.
39.,"men training. Sweat and smoke fill the air along with the faint scent of blood. Fighters, both black and white, train with each other. Morrie is amazed."
morrie,How do they get away with this?
pk,There he is.
morrie,"Christ, he's old."
pk,"And he's the best.    C'mon. PK leads Morrie across the gym. PK passes an African fighter. He stops training when he sees PK. He turns to another African fighter, glancing at PK. One by one the blacks in the gym stop training to look at PK. PK and Morrie approach the rheumy Old Man yelling at the two fighters in the ring above him in a thick Polish- Jewish accent."
solly,What?    You boys lost?
pk,I'm the one who called you yesterday. From the Prince of Wales School?
solly,"Oh yeah, yeah.     The champeen. Right? PK  Right."
solly,And who are you?
morrie,The champeen's manager.
solly,Oy gevalt.  You know you train here it's not like those nice school fights you're used to. Three knockdowns you win.
morrie,What does it cost for you to train him?
solly,"For my personal attentinons, Mr. Manager? Fifty pounds a month. For one of them...  ... less."
morrie,Here's for six months in advance. Three hundred pounds. Solly pushes the money back.
solly,Six months? I don't know your boy'll last six minutes.
pk,I'll last.
41.,"What are you staring? Punch, don't stare. C'mon. Work or you're out."
pk,"Yes, sir."
solly,Go change in the back. We'll see if you couldn't find a better use for all that money.
pk,"Thank you, sir."
solly,"Why's he want to do this, a nice- looking schoolboy?"
morrie,He wants to be welterweight champ of the world.
solly,"Oh sure, sure. And I'd like to be twenty-five again."
morrie,You like to make book on it?
solly, You giving odds?
morrie,You name them.
solly,You both meshugah.
solly,Never I seen someone so young throw an eight-punch combination. Where did you learn such a thing?
pk,"In prison, sir."
solly,"You trying to be a comedian and a boxer? Mr. Manager, come to my office. We'll talk terms. You, get showered, and see me after. We'll talk training. Solly and Morrie head off toward Solly's office. PK watches them go, a small victorious smile on his face."
pk,"Yes, sir."
von zyl,I am Kommandant Von Zyl. The professor has requested you to be his visitor so you can continue your studies on piano and he can continue with his studies on cactus. This is the first specimen?
von zyl,"The professor taught you this, ja? Of course to your English town he is a prisoner, a criminal. To us who respect such learning and culture, he is an honored guest."
von zyl,"This pass is good for any time, any day. Would you like to see him now?"
pk,"Yes, sir. VON ZYL Come.   I will take you myself. Von Zyl rises and opens the door for PK.    They exit."
von zyl,"We have cleared a little plot behind the cellblock for the cactus. And tomorrow we have the professor's piano moved here. There is not another instrument like it in the territory. Maybe one day the two of you can give a concert for us, hey?"
pk,"Yes, sir."
von zyl,You like to box?
pk,"I would like to learn, meneer. Are the boys prisoners?"
von zyl," No, no. The sons of the guards. See that one there? (points to a"
45.,"little pudge boy flailing away) That's my son, Danie. It's a club. Lieutenant Smit."
smit,Sir?
von zyl,We have room for one more on the squad? Smit looks down at PK.
smit,"He's a little small, Kommandant. VON ZYL We'll build him up then."
smit,"Yes, sir.   But I really don't have anyone  to spare to teach him right now.   You know, with the tournament  coming up."
von zyl,There must be someone.
smit,Piet.
smit,"You teach this boy basics, and you teach him good or I knock your black head flat, you hear?"
geel piet,"I teach him best I know, baas."
smit,"We train every day. First thing in the morning. Miss two trainings, you're gone."
pk,"Yes, meneer."
smit,Come tomorrow.     See this old kaffir.
pk,"Yes, meneer.     Thank you, meneer. VON ZYL Lieutenant, a word?"
pk,"Yes, sir. GEEL PIET No, no. Don't never call me sir. 'Specially in front of the guards."
pk,What should I call you?
geel piet,Piet.   Geel Piet.
coach,Kaffir.   Towels. Geel Piet assumes his submissive posture again.
geel piet,"Okay, baas.    Coming, baas. He winks at PK and shuffles off.     A BELL SOUNDS."
maria,You took a big chance talking to my father the way you did.
pk,Not really. Going in I was behind on points with him. I'm English. I attend a politically suspect school. I'm a boxer.
maria,He likes boxers.
pk,All men like boxers. But not for their daughters. So I had to find some way to make an impression.
maria,You could have picked a more agreeable topic. PK And made much less of an impression. Talk to someone about their passion. Even if they disagree they'll remember you. It was really the most logical strategy if you think about it.
maria,"Do you spend hours thinking about how to deal with me, too?"
pk,Days. MARIA Know what I think? 
48.,You're dangerous.
maria,When I was little we would go to my grandfather's farm in the high veldt for holiday.
maria,"My father would take    me   to the top of the highest hill    and   we'd play this game, 'What Do    You   See' until we ran out of things    to   see. Do you ever play that? PK No."
maria,Want to try?
pk,Sure.
maria,I see a forest. It goes      on forever. There are giant      trees which keep getting bigger     and bigger over thousands of     years. Now you.
pk,"I see little trees growing on the forest floor, learning to grow with the little bit of light the big trees let in. Now you."
maria,"I see the big trees getting bigger, their leaves and branches making one great green umbrella over all of Africa. The wheel stops again at its highest point."
49.,"I see the sun growing weaker, giving off less light. I see the big trees dying because they cannot live without a lot of light. I see the little trees take over the forest because they learn to adapt."
maria,"You tell a very good story. Her eyes sparkle, making her irresistible. PK leans forward. Maria turns her face towards him. Her lips part slightly. They kiss tenderly."
geel piet,You wear out this old man. See? See how it can work? How little beat big?
pk,"Yes, sir.     But when do I get to punch?"
geel piet,"You not going to just punch, man. You going to combination."
geel piet,One-two. One-two. C'mon.       Now you. One-two. One-two.
50.,PK does his best to mimic.
geel piet,Oh do we have     a boxer here. Yes sir. We build      you to eight-punch combination.      The Geel Piet eight. Then you catch     afire. One-two. One-two.
pk,Try and hit me.
pk,No.   C'mon.
pk,No.   Try hard.
doc,You are amazing. PK And I'm going to learn the Geel Piet eight.
doc,"Yes, yes, yes. But right now you have to come learn the Beethoven Fifth for one hour so we can get to the cactus before it's too hot to plant. Did you bring her?"
pk,Parchypodium Namquanium.
doc,Excellent. Excellent. We make from you a champion and a brain.
51.,"GEEL PIET  Excuse me, big baas. But can I talk to the small baas?"
doc,Of course.
pk,It keeps the roots wet. GEEL PIET What happens to the leaf after?
doc,A little I use in some water to make a bug spray for the plants.
pk,"And the rest we throw away. Geel Piet fidgets.   He drops his head, speaking low."
geel piet,"If you leave the pail when you go plant is a problem, small baas?"
pk,I don't understand.
geel piet,Is like this. You see how hard the life is for the people here in prison. Only little pleasure they take from this hard life maybe sometimes when no one watching late at night -- a little smoke. Now with the big war in Europe tobacco is plenty hard to get outside. Inside it is gone. We are the forgotten in here.
pk,We have bunches of leaves at home. I'll bring a whole bucketful tomorrow.
52.,"GEEL PIET No, no.   Mustn't do that, little baas."
pk,I don't understand.
doc,What Geel Piet means is it can be dangerous. Something the guards might not want the people to have.
pk,What's wrong with tobacco? Why wouldn't they want them to have it?
doc,What's wrong is people whose job it is to punish. After a little while it is all they know how to do.
pk,What should I do?
doc,This is for you to answer.
bormann,"I smell something not right here, ay, kaffir? He pokes Geel Piet with his truncheon."
geel piet," No, meneer sergeant. Everything okay here."
doc,Schweinhund.
geel piet,"No, no.  This old kaffir's okay. Sorry to make any trouble, little baas. We  just stick to the boxing now on.  Sorry, sorry."
pk,Geel Piet. Geel Piet turns.
pk,I leave my bucket on the side by Doc's toilet when I practice piano.
doc,"PK, to me you are the champion of the world already. Come. Let us go box now with Mr. Beethoven."
solly,Now at the end of the Geel Piet eight you do this... one-two...  One-two-three... the Solly Goldman thirteen. Okay?
solly,"That's it. That's it. Move him around. Jab jab. Slip slip. Now. PK pours it on, laying in the Geel Piet eight.   Solly is silently counting."
solly,And... one-two... one-two-three.
solly,"That's it. That's it. Now work around the defense. Jab jab. The opponent becomes aggressive.   PK starts dancing, slipping punches."
morrie,"How do you get away with this, Mr. G? Why don't they close you down? I mean, there are laws about blacks and white boxing each other."
solly,"In a public match. Not in a gym. Not yet anyway. The Boer is a funny people. Outside the ring the black is not equal. Inside he is. But only in private, not in public. So I keep my mouth shut, the police go a little blind, and that's that. It's a crazy world, huh?"
solly,Work him on the heavy bag.
55.,office and Solly closes the door.
morrie,"Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That's it."
assistant,Solly wants to see you two.
morrie,"You wanted to see us, Mr. G.?"
solly,Close the door.  Someone I got a lot of respect for asked me to make a request. He wants to put you in a match. MORRIE With who?
solly,A young guy just turned pro. Gideon Mandoma.
morrie,A black fighter! They want him to fight a black fighter?
solly,In a black township.   Sofiatown.
morrie,"Out of the question. Not even up for discussion. C'mon, P.K."
56.,Morrie goes to exit.   PK doesn't.
pk,Who asked you to ask?
solly,The man who promotes all the fights in Sofiatown -- Elias Nguni.
pk,And you trust him?
solly,"In thirty years I know him, number one on the list."
morrie,You're both out of your minds.
pk,Did he tell you why he wants the match? SOLLY I told you what he told me.
pk,Just talking boxing -- how do I match up with Mandoma?
solly,"Pretty even. MORRIE I mean besides    getting thrown out of school and    into jail, do you know what else    happens you do this? He's a     pro. The minute you fight him    you're a pro."
solly,There's no purse being offered.
morrie,That's a good career move. Risk everything to gain nothing. Very sound business sense.
pk,Tell Mr. Nguni I'll think about it.
morrie,Okay.    What's going on?
pk,I don't know.
morrie,Well why don't you tell me what you do know. PK There's an African myth about an outsider who comes one day and unites all the tribes into one against their oppressors. They call it the myth of Onoshobishobi Ingelosi -- the tadpole angel. That chanting at the school championships?
morrie,For you? PK I haven't heard it in years.
pk,"I told you about bringing tobacco to the prisoners at Barberton? Well after that was going for a while I learned that even though they could send and receive letters, they never did. They couldn't read or write. MORRIE So you did it for them."
pk,Right.
morrie,And after that?
pk,A clothing program for their families and a food program. One thing sort of led to another.
morrie,"I can see where 'angel' would be an appropriate title.  But it was, uh, this Geel Piet who was really behind all of it, wasn't it?"
pk,He was very good at pointing things out.
morrie,"Man like that should be running a country, not rotting in prison."
pk,He's not in prison anymore.  He's dead.
pk,"Well, you succeeded."
maria,Mr. Goldman was explaining the theory behind the left hook. MORRIE Beats talking about the weather. You may have heard about me?
59.,I'm Morrie.
maria,Oh yes.   How d'you do.
solly,"Well, nice meeting you, Maria."
maria,"Nice meeting you, Mr. Goldman."
solly,"We never had a girl come to the gym.  It's not such a bad thing, huh? Solly moves off."
pk,You got a pass to come out on a weeknight?
maria,Your tree pass.
maria,"Do you box too, Morrie?"
morrie,Do I look that daft?
pk,Morrie's the brains of the operation.
morrie,He means the bank. Your boyfriend has a great head for literature but none for finance.
pk," I see you, Nguni."
nguni,"I see you, P.K."
nguni,You have heard my request?
pk,Yes.    Why do you make it?
nguni,A woman has thrown the sacred ox bones. She has made a fire and read the smoke.
pk,What did she read?
nguni,That the Onoshobishobi Ingelosi who is a chief must fight the one who one day will be a chief.
pk,But it's not true that I'm a chief.
nguni,"Who knows what is true and what is not. The legend of Onoshobishobi Ingelosi is very powerful among the people. They see you box the Boer and always you win. They have heard the stories from Barberton. The people live with little hope. They must see if the spirit of the boy still lives in the man. PK And   if I lose? If the spirit of the   Onoshobishobi Ingelosi does not   exist in me anymore, then what will   they live with?"
nguni,Less hope.   But still they must
61.,see.   It is our way.
morrie,I'm his manager.
62.,Nguni.
pk,I'll do it.
maria,"I'm scared for you, PK."
pk,Solly's a great teacher. He wouldn't put me in a fight I couldn't handle.
marie,I mean about how involved you are with the black people. That scares me.
pk,Because you don't understand them. MARIA No I don't. PK If you did you wouldn't be so scared. You ever have a conversation with a black person? MARIA Of course.
pk,Besides a servant.
pk,You should sometime.
maria,I hate it when you tease me.
pk,Sorry.
pk,Yes I am.
maria,I better go.
lewis,According to your submission you have ambitions to be a writer and the welterweight boxing champion of the world.
lewis,"Don't you   find seeking a career as a pugilist   and reading for a degree at   Oxford a bit, how shall we put it,   intellectually"
64.,incompatible.
pk,"Lord Byron was a boxer, sir. And I've never heard anyone question his intellectual integrity."
lewis,I do not recall Lord Byron actually engaging in matches for money.
pk,"Actually, sir, there are several recorded instances of Lord Byron engaging in matches for quite large sums of money."

pk,You know every time they do that I want to jump up and say I'm just a twelve-year-old. I'm not anything else.
geel piet,"To them you are. You are the one who brings the smoke, the one who writes the letters, the one who puts clothes on their children when they are cold. You are Onoshobishobi Ingelosi."
pk,But you know that's not true.
geel piet,"Who is to say what is true and what is not true, kleine baas. Doc comes running up, excited, waving a newspaper."
doc,The Allied armies have crossed the Rhine into Germany. It is almost over.
pk,"That's great, isn't it? He turns to Geel Piet."
doc,"You are a good    faker, Geel Piet. but you don't    think it's great at all. It means     you lose your star letter writer    and tobacco importer."
geel piet,"No matter that, Professor. We always manage here. What pains me most is I lose my boxer."
pk,I'll come back.
geel piet," No, kleine baas. You leave this damn place you don't come back never. DOC Geel Piet, when a painter finishes a work of art he doesn't lose it. He sends it out in the world so everyone can see the genius of his creation. This is what you are going to do. And to celebrate the launch of such a work of art as you have made our boxer here, I have composed an entire concerto -- 'The Concerto for the Southland' -- which it is my intention to play in concert for the prisoners before I leave."
geel piet,Not possible. The kommandant never allow the people to have such a thing.
doc,"He'll think it's a concert for him and the brass. But we'll know, ay? And the people will know."
pk,"He'll never let black be with white here, Doc."
doc,If the black is part of the
68.,"orchestra, like the piano, he will."
geel piet,"But the people have no instruments in this place, big baas."
doc,"They have their voices. Each tribe a different voice, a different language -- all singing together. It is brilliant, no?"
pk,Except the tribes don't trust each other. They don't even talk to each other.
doc, Oh. This is correct.    This stupid hatred.
geel piet,"They will do it for you, kleine baas. You are Onoshobishobi Ingelosi. You bring the tobacco. You write the letters. You put clothes on their children's bodies and food in their bellies. All you do is ask and they all sing for you."
doc,He's right. Wunderbar.    You are the smartest of us all. Geel Piet smiles as he lifts the watering pot to exit.   A truncheon stops him. All turn to Sergeant Bormann.
bormann,"A kaffir smarter than all of us? You are a strange German, Professor."
doc,"That little maniac with the moustache in Berlin you admire. He is the strange German. And soon kaput, I hope."
bormann,"If that's true you'll not be long for this place, eh, Professor?"
69.,"DOC No, Sergeant.    God willing."
bormann,"And you, too, little Rooinek.     But you, kaffir, Hitler comes or goes..."
bormann,You are going to stay with me.

von zyl,I want to address these filthy kaffirs but I don't have a translator.
pk,I'll translate.
von zyl,"You can speak Zulu, PK? PK Yes, sir."

nguni,We are here.
morrie,I don't see why we have to weigh in. They're going to fight anyway.
nguni,It is very important the people see everything is correct.
pk," I see you, Gideon Mandoma."
mandoma,"I see you, PK."
pk,I just want you to know you fight a man. Onoshobishobi Ingelosi is just a name I was given at Barberton Prison. It means nothing.
mandoma,"It is not for you or me to say what it means. An old man, one of the dignitaries says something to Nguni."
nguni,Please.

crowd,Onoshobishopi Ingelosi. Shobi shobi Ingelosi.
old woman,Onoshobishobi Ingelosi.

pk,What do you see?
solly,A very tough fight.

solly,He's going for the quick knockout. He can't keep it up. Soon the truck runs out of gas.

both,"Yes, sir."
pk,You speak English?
mandoma,Second greatest in this room.
pk,But you didn't come to talk about fighting.
mandoma,To be part of something you must know what everyone else knows. We have our own knowledge. We need yours.
morrie,"We get our knowledge in schools, Gideon. We're not born with it."
mandoma,Then it must be the same with us.
morrie,You have schools.
mandoma,Yes. And teachers who cannot do more than their own ABC's. We have a system made not to teach us.
pk," I am only seventeen years old, Gideon. I cannot teach five million people how to speak English and do sums. MANDOMA You taught the singing to thousands at Barberton Prison. You were only twelve. Mandoma rises."
pk,"I'm only asking you to put what you've taught us into practice, sir."
pk,"The reputation of this school, sir, is based on its integrity."
89.,ST. JOHN I'm aware of that. I'm also aware of what will happen if this ever gets out. We live in a country where the rules are being rewritten.
pk,Then we'd better be careful to keep a firm hand on our pens...  ... sir.
maria,Ready.   Set.   Go!
maria,You're supposed to let me win.
pk,Then you'd say I was being condescending. MARIA You were guilty of that when you gave me a head start.
maria,Get your formal yet?
pk,Uh... no.
maria,The dance is only a week away.
pk,Maria...  I can't come to the dance.
maria, Why not? PK I have an obligation.
maria,Can't you change it?
pk,It's a permanent obligation. Every Saturday night...  It starts tonight.
maria,You're breaking up with me.
pk,No.
maria,Then what could be so important that it takes all your Saturday nights?
pk,I really can't say. Maria starts to cry.   She throws her arm around him.
91.,"P.K., I love you.     Please don't go away."
pk,I'm not going away. MARIA Yes you are.   I can feel it.
pk,I'm not.   I'm just tutoring.
maria,I'm losing you to a bunch of kaffirs?
pk,"You're not losing anything. MARIA No? Are you escorting me to the dance? Are you going to see me on the only free night they give us? PK Maria, this is important to me. MARIA And my life's important to me. Damn you."

doc," Ach.   You see how beautiful? PK You ever hear of glycerine, Doc?"
doc,Mr. Going-To-Oxford-Smarty-Pants. Of course I know about glycerine. Triglycerine. Biglycerine. Monoglycerine. What do you want to know?
pk,Why you don't use it. It's only a little pill under the tongue.
doc,"Tongues were not made to put little pills under. When I have to start with that, I become something else."
pk,"Well, until you become something else, the little pills would make this easier on your heart."
doc,Don't look at me.     Go!
doc,Exploring.
pk,Why don't you just rest?
doc,Plenty time for resting when I am something else. Look.
doc,When does a cave have wind?    This
94.,"is more than some little cave, my friend."
doc,Here.   See?   There is a passage.
doc,You know the pyramids are nothing more than man's attempt to recreate the first safe home our species had -- the cave. It is the ultimate safe resting place. The first place man could lay down and have a good night's sleep without worrying about waking up as something's supper. Doc stops crawling.   So does PK.   A DRIPPING can be heard. DOC You hear that? There is something waiting for us.
pk,Let's hope it's not hungry.
doc,"Better, ja?"
pk,What's that smell?
pk,"What's that? Doc recognizes the sound. He pounces on PK, knocking him to the floor and covering him with his body. Not a moment too soon. For a thousand bats fill the tunnel flying through."
pk,"Maybe it's stopped raining. DOC Who can think about rain when you are on the edge of the great unknown cave. PK You don't know that. DOC The bats didn't come from a shoebox, Mr. Know-It-All."
doc,Sometimes I think maybe sending you off to that fancy-shmancy school was not such a good idea.
pk,It was your idea. Your'e the one who pushed for me to go. DOC Ja. But who knew they do such a good job of boxing up part of
96.,your brain.
pk,Which part is that?
doc,The one where is all the questions. The curiosity center. Look.
doc,Did I tell you?
doc,"Wunderbar. The whole chamber    glistens with an eerie phosphorescence. Toward one end of    the crystallized room eight stalagmites grown up from the    floor cement to form a huge crystal slab some ten feet    off the floor. A buttress of stalg- mites drip off it    forming a natural, if uneven, stairway."
doc,"How many hundreds of thousands of years to make this masterpiece? Everything outside can change, P.K. This remains the same. We are in the heart of Africa, P.K. The heart of Africa."
97.,"left? Crystal. Like a crystal mummy. Incredible, ja?"
pk, Incredible.
pk,I wish we had brought the camera. Think there's enough light to shoot?
pk,Doc?
pk,Doc?
pk,This is not funny.
doc,This is incredible! The crystal. You can feel the life go right through you. Here.
doc,Come try it.
pk, No.   That's all right.   Can we go?
doc,"We have only just gotten here. What's the matter, P.K.?"
pk,"All day long you've been talking about becoming something else, about dying. You never talked about dying before."
doc,I'm 87 next month.   It's natural.
pk,Not to a sixteen-year-old it's not. It's painful.
pk,"I'll just set you up with some coffee here, so in the morning you won't have to bother making it."
pk,I didn't mean to tell you what
99.,you can and can't talk about back in the cave today. I guess I just don't like to think of you being...  I just wish it weren't with you.
pk,Doc?
doc,P.K.?
pk,"I'm here, Doc."
doc,"The crystal cave will be our secret, ja? PK Whatever you say."
doc,Promise.
pk,I promise.
doc,"Ja.  Good. I rest a little.  The heart of Africa, P.K."
doc,The heart.
morrie,"Christ! If someone would have told me this is where I'd be on a Saturday night, last term of my senior year, I'd call them batty.  You know, you're going to owe me for the rest of your life on this one. PK That all? I figured you'd hold me to it longer."

mandoma," You are one brave Boer, Miss Maria."
maria,Thank you.
mandoma,And you are one lucky English. He kids PK.   PK blushes.
pk,"Good night, Gideon. He playfully pushes Gideon out the gate and closes it. He turns to Maria and Morrie."
morrie,"Well, I   think I'll go... um... lay on   my back and count the cracks   in the ceiling. 'Night. Nice to   see you, Maria."
maria,"Good night, Morrie."
pk,I am one lucky English. They embrace and kiss.
maria,P.K.     Can I ask you a favor?
pk,Anything. MARIA We don't have to go in    or anything. You can hear the music    from outside. I'd love to     have one dance with you before    I graduate.
pk,Done.
maria,I feel so good. Race you to the gate.
pk,You need a headstart?
maria,No.
morrie,We made it!   We made it!
morrie,Sorry. I couldn't bear the suspense after I read mine.   I had to open it. PK looks at his letter.
morrie,Three months and we're out of here.

morrie,A technicality.
boy,St. John wants to see you two in his study.
morrie,Good news travels fast.
pk,I'll get showered and changed.
boy,He said to come as you are. Immediately.

bretyn,You don't have certification to do that.
pk,Prince of Wales is a certified school.
bretyn,Yes.   But not certified for that

pk,Morrie.   Morrie.
morrie,What?
pk,I want to show you something.
morrie,What time is it?
morrie,Can I see it later?
pk,No.   Come on.
morrie,"You know, when we get to Oxford -- separate rooms."
pk,Will you hurry.
morrie,Is there some girl out there waiting for me? PK Yeah. Stunning. Breasts like casabas. Just waiting for you.
morrie,Bullshit.
pk,What do you think? MORRIE I think you're fooling yourself into thinking the bastards won't
111.,come after us in here.
pk,This is a church. Didn't you ever hear of the Christian concept of sanctuary?
morrie,Yes. But I'm not the one who has to respect it.

maria,I do.
pk,So far so good.
pk,I want to thank you all for having the courage to come tonight.  Thank you.
all, You're welcome. PK I will be teaching the first part of class tonight and Mr. Levy will teach the second. A woman whispers something to Mandoma.     Mandoma raises his hand.

bretyn,"No. You are with your damned race mixing ideas, rooinek."
pk,"At least let the women go. BRETYN You want everything to be equal, little Boetie. Why not men and women too? Just then Morrie throws the bolt."
morrie,"Now! He goes to charge out the door, but to his chagrin the door does not open, locked from the outside."
117.,Bretyn smiles cruelly.
bretyn,"Locks keep people out but they also keep them in. He has walked right up to Morrie, not taking his eyes off Morrie's for a moment. Morrie meets his gaze evenly. The moment is broken as Bretyn's baton slams into Morrie's stomach, dropping him to this knees. BRETYN Get up, you bloody commie Jew! He bangs Morrie hard in the jaw, knocking him out cold."
bretyn,"Captain. The two police lines start to move towards each other, sandwiching the Africans, PK and Maria."

bretyn,Now.
maria,PK!
120., You're applying to South African universities?
pk,In case the scholarship doesn't come through.
morrie,Why are you so bloody stubborn? You don't belong in a South African university any more than I belong in the priesthood. Will you take my father's loan?
boy,There a Mr. P.K. here?
morrie,It's your scholarship. Morrie grabs the telegram.

PK looks out at the cactus garden, watered now by drip irrigation. VON ZYL At the beginning of the week he wasn't home so I decided to drop by myself. Waited a whole day here. When he didn't come back I sent search parties. After three days I sent the telegram. Seven days is a long time for him to be gone. Do you have any ideas where he went?"

solly,"A repeat performance of history, my boy. Solly Goldman's being deported. Of course last time I didn't have the luxury of being able to pack."
pk,For what reason?
solly,"Their reason is that I'm here illegal. I didn't enter the country with a passport. Like the Czar was issuing passports to Russian Jews in 1910. PK This is because of me, isn't it?"
solly,"No, boychick. This is because of them. They are the problem, not you. Don't ever think different. You look tired. Want a glass tea? PK No, no.   I have to get back to school."
solly,"You got your head screwed on right. Don't let these meshuganahs screw it on wrong. Now go on. You want to find me, look at Benny Rosen's gym in East End, London."
pk,Thank you for everything.
solly,We're not finished yet.
marais,You're a very good writer. The subject matter is a little inflammatory but the style is interesting.
pk,What are you doing here? MARAIS I came to inform you that you will not be receiving aid from the National Scholarship Fund. Neither will you be admitted to any of the South African universities. Here are your applications back.
marais,I told you when you came to my house. I am first a member of my tribe and I will defend it any way I know how.
morrie,Take the hint. Screw the scholarship. Come on. Let's leave.

jocko,"When you come up on the boards, boyo, it's time to bow out. It's an omen."
pk,"I bow out you can't make book. JOCKO PK, it's not a bet I want to collect."
pk,"Tell me, Jocko, how high will the odds go on something like this?"
jocko,"The shorter your time, the higher they go. With you probably ten, twelve, thirteen to one when you're short a month. PK When the odds hit the top put me in against all bets for two hundred quid."
jocko,I did not come here to solicit your bet.
pk,"I know that. I appreciate it. But if you don't take it, someone else will."
jocko,All  right. You're a bleery fool. And  I'll be prayin' every night it's  the only bet I ever have to pay  off on.
