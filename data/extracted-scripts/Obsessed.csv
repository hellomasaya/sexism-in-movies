Speaker,Dialogue
woman's voice,Derek?
beth,What are you going to do with that? CUT TO:
beth's voice,This is coming down.
derek's voice,Why? BETH'S VOICE Do you want people to think we put it up?
derek's voice, I don't know. I kind of like it.
beth's voice,Please tell me you're joking.
derek,"All I'm saying, before we take it down... maybe we should try it out.  You know. Christen the new house."
beth,And what do you suggest we use for a bed?
derek,What do we need a bed for when we've got a fine shag carpet?
beth, Because I'm gonna have fine shag carpet tattoos all over my --
derek, Told `em I'd be late.
beth,What about...
derek,Kyle? That boy wouldn't wake up if a nuclear bomb went off.
beth,"Maybe not, but the movers..."
derek,Won't be here for another hour.
beth,"Derek, you are so bad."
3.,CONTINUED:
derek,Isn't THAT why you married me?
derek,Want me to stay?     Crack the whip on these guys?
beth,No. Go to work and earn that promotion. Somebody's got to pay for all this.
4.,CONTINUED:
isa,Gage/Bendix?
derek,Excuse me?
lisa,I couldn't help but notice we're both going to Seven.
5.,CONTINUED:
derek,Right.   Gage/Bendix.   I work there.
lisa,I thought you might.
derek,Do you have an appointment with us?
lisa,Why?   Do I look like a client?
derek,"Actually, you do."
lisa," W ell, I hate to shatter the illusion but I'm just a lowly temp."
derek, You're a temp?
lisa,Just here for the day.
derek,"Well, you could have fooled me."
lisa,I'm beginning to think these heels were a big mistake.
6.,CONTINUED: 
derek,No problem. Happen to anybody.
isa,Thanks.   I owe you one.
derek, Are you following me?
lisa,No. I'm taking these files to Mister Charles' office. They said it was this way.
derek,Derek Charles?
lisa,I guess you probably know him.
derek,"Oh, yeah, I know him.  Kind of an asshole, takes himself waaaay too seriously. But don't tell him I said that.     L ISA I could get you into trouble?"
derek,Deep trouble.
atrick,"Morning, Derek. How's the new house?"
7.,CONTINUED: 
derek,"Total chaos. Lucky for me, I sneaked out as soon as the movers showed up."
patrick,Beth must have loved that.
derek,If she calls mad -- and she will -- tell her I'm in a meeting.
patrick,Remember who used to sit at this desk? She'll know I am lying.
derek, Good point.
patrick, Can I help you?
lisa,That's Derek Charles?
patrick,Yes.
lisa,The good ones are always married.
patrick, Or straight.
derek,"Matter of fact, I just got off the line to Berlin."
gage,And?
derek,Ganz doesn't like the way the Stock Market's been gyrating and he thinks the hedge fund wave is about to crest.
age,You think he's right?
derek,"Hell, no. I think he's a hundred percent wrong. We haven't even gotten close to that point yet. Hedge fund demand is coming from individual investors which is why it's gaining mainstream acceptance. You know Ganz. He gets paranoid when anything goes mainstream. He started making Auf Wiedersehen noises but I managed to talk him into a private equity portfolio instead... to the tune of 155 mil."
age," I knew there was a reason I promoted you. No offense, Ben."
ben,"None taken, Joe. I'm just honored to be allowed to exist in Derek's world."
9.,CONTINUED:
gage,Good. I want you to throw Derek all your support on this one. T hat's when Lisa walks by on the other side of the glass. Gage perks up.
ben,Never seen `em before.
derek,I think she's one of the temps.
ben,You mean temptress...
gage,"Remind me to call that agency and have them send over a couple more just like her. Doesn't hurt to have a little eye candy around the office, does it, boys?"
ben,I scored an extra Lakers ticket for tomorrow night. Think you can get free?
derek,I'm moving into a new house.
en,So?
derek,Do I look like a man who wants a divorce?
en,I could call and say it's a work emergency.
10.,CONTINUED:
derek,"Thanks, but I think I'll stay married instead."
ben, Coward.
lisa,"Good night, Mister Charles."
derek, Sorry but you set me up.
lisa," Don't worry. I'll get my revenge.    And by the way, you might like to know everybody who works here strongly disagrees with you."
derek,About what?
lisa,About Derek Charles being an asshole. They all say he's the nicest guy in the firm.
derek,"Well, that just proves he's got `em all fooled."
lisa,"And he's humble, too.   I'm Lisa, by the way. Lisa Sheridan."
derek,"Well, it was nice to meet you, Lisa Sheridan. Good luck with your next job --"
11.,CONTINUED: 
lisa,"Actually, they're keeping me on a few more days, so I'll probably see you on Monday."
derek,Damn.   Almost made it.
beth,Your turn.
derek,"Hey, little man. What's wrong?    You should be...  Uh oh. Poopy diaper. Beth..."
beth, I've been changing him all day.
derek,Whew.   What's that woman been feeding you?
beth,"Well, we toasted the house --"
derek,Toasted Kyle --
beth,Your promotion --
derek,But I've saved the most important toast for last...  To my beautiful wife who I love and adore more than anything in the world.
beth,And to my handsome husband. I asked for the moon and he gave me the stars.
derek, Uh huh?
beth,How would you feel about trying out that mirror again? This time in our own bed.
derek, Yeah? Give the magic mirror another test drive?
beth,You know how I like looking at your sexy butt.
13.,CONTINUED:
derek," Beth, you are so bad."
beth,Isn't that WHY you married ME?
lisa,Hi.   Remember me?
derek,"Lisa Sheridan, Girl Temp.     Where's Patrick?"
lisa,Out with the flu. I did some trading with the other temps and wrangled your desk. I hope that's okay. D EREK Uh... sure.
marge,"Good morning, Derek."
derek,Grab your pad and follow me.
14.,CONTINUED:
lisa,I put a memo on your desk about the Christmas party this Friday.
erek,Is it that time already?
lisa,Why don't they invite spouses?
derek,How's that?
lisa,"To the Christmas party.    It says ""for employees only."""
derek,"It's like that in most companies. They think people are more inhibited in front of their spouses, less likely to kick back and enjoy themselves and mingle with co-workers, which is what the party is about."
lisa,"So, does this party get pretty wild?"
derek,Just the opposite.
lisa,Well that's no fun.
derek," No, it's perfect."
15.,CONTINUED: 
lisa,Fire away.
derek,"Well, it's Monday and first thing on Monday..."
lisa,I took care of that.
derek,Took care of what?
lisa,On Mondays you always send your wife a dozen long-stemmed red roses.  I called to confirm they've been delivered.
derek,Thanks.
lisa,I think that's incredibly sweet.   How long have you two been married?
derek,Three years in March.
lisa,And you still send her flowers every Monday morning? Lucky girl.
derek,It's kind of a tradition.
lisa,Patrick said you started sending them back when Beth worked here as your assistant. Is that how you won her heart?
derek,"Well, it took a little more than roses.  We need to run some calls."
lisa, Ready when you are.
16.,CONTINUED: 
derek, Are you always this efficient?
lisa,Does that surprise you?
derek,"Well, it's just that most of the temps we get here..."
lisa,I think you'll find I'm not your typical temp.
derek,No.   Definitely not.  Okay not your typical temp... start with Phil Trendle at Emerson... set up a lunch for end of the week. Wherever he wants but push the Water Grill. Then Terry Mills at Imagio. Am I going too fast for you?
lisa,No.    Go faster.   I can handle it.
beth,It's a beautiful little park with a duck pond and close enough to push Kyle.
derek,I don't know. It's shaping up to be a work weekend.
17.,CONTINUED:
beth,"You can work at home and then we'll go to the barbecue. A s Beth chats on, Derek gets a weird feeling. Still on the phone, he slowly gets up from his desk and moves quietly to the door. He looks out, expecting to catch Lisa listening in. Instead, she's not at her desk. She's standing several feet away at a file cabinet. She turns and smiles at him."
lisa,Do you need me?
beth,Work at the office.     This is home.   Come to bed.
derek,In a sec.
beth,The card that came today with the roses...
erek,Uh huh?
beth,"... was addressed ""To Betty."""
erek,Betty?
beth, Your other wife? Yeah. Who's Betty?
18.,CONTINUED:
derek,Blame it on the new girl. Patrick called in sick and I had a temp on my desk. B ETH I thought we had a deal. No female assistants.
derek,"Honey, I don't control the temp pool."
beth,She pretty?
derek,"Yeah, she's pretty... plain."
beth, I don't care. I want her fired immediately.
derek,"Actually, she did a great job... aside from the card."
eth,"Night, Derek."
derek,Night... Betty.
19.,CONTINUED:
beth,Hope you don't mind us dropping in unannounced.
derek,You kidding? This is a treat.
beth,Sheila's meeting us for lunch at Central Market. Then I'm taking Kyle to the Grove.  And who are we going to see at the Grove?
kyle, Santa!
beth, You want to come?   Get your picture taken on Santa's lap?
derek,I'd love to but I'm all jammed up.     But say hi to your sister.
beth,"That guy she was seeing, the one we met at Thanksgiving... Jack. D EREK The one she said was perfect."
beth,Apparently he's not so perfect.   He told her he just wants to be FWB.
derek,FWB?
beth,Friends With Benefits.
derek,What does that mean?
beth,You know.    Sex but no commitments.
derek,And Sheila's got a problem with that?
20.,CONTINUED: 
lisa,Excuse me.
derek,"Lisa, this is my wife Beth.       Beth, Lisa. She's temping for Patrick."
beth, Hi.
lisa,"It's great to meet you, Mrs. Charles. eyes lighting up) And this must be Kyle. I can already tell he's going to grow up to be a heartbreaker."
derek,"Kyle, say hello."
beth,He can say hello. He's usually not this shy around strangers.
lisa,What a handsome boy.  He looks just like you.
derek,"Actually, most people think he takes after Beth."
lisa,Talk about the perfect family. The three of you should be on a magazine cover.
beth,I hope my husband's not working you too hard.
21.,CONTINUED: 
lisa, Joe Gage needs to see you when you get a minute.
beth,"Well, that's our cue to leave.    We just dropped in to say hi.  Come on, big boy."
lisa,It was great to meet you... Beth.
eth,"You, too... Laura."
lisa,Lisa.
beth,Excuse me?
lisa,It's Lisa.      You said Laura.
beth,I did?
lisa," Bye, Kyle. Say hi to Santa for me."
derek, That was intentional.
22.,CONTINUED: 
beth,"Wasn't me. Blame ""Betty.""    So what's the deal with her?"
derek,What do you mean?
beth,She knew I was taking Kyle to Santa.
derek,So?
beth,So she was obviously listening at the door.
derek,"Well, she probably didn't know when to come in."
beth,"I thought you said she was plain. Derek, that girl may be a lot of things but one of them is not plain."
derek,"How would I know?    I only have eyes for you.      B ETH  Oh, you are so slick."
derek,Come on. I'll walk you to the elevator. You can say hi to the old gang.  Ever miss it?
beth,I like to think I traded up.
23.,CONTINUED:
patrick,Much. Thanks.  You know it's going to take more than the flu to keep me away from that Christmas party.
erek,You get around don't you?
patrick,Yeah... She's not speaking to me at the moment.
24.,CONTINUED:
derek,Alright.   You two behave yourselves out here...
patrick," So, how many times did you get busted listening in on Derek's calls?"
lisa," I'm way too devious to ever get caught. Besides, I thought all you assistants listened in."
patrick, We do.
lisa,How long have you worked here?
patrick,Ten years this Spring.
isa,I'll bet you know more about what goes on behind these closed doors than anybody.
patrick,Oh you got that right girl.    I know all the dirty little secrets. L ISA Well maybe we should grab a drink some night after work for a little girl talk.
patrick," Listen, honey, if you think you can buy my silence with a couple of Cosmo's... you're right."
lisa,Sorry.     I thought everybody was at lunch.
derek,No. Stay. I was just gonna take this back to my office.
lisa,It's nothing.
derek,Most people I know don't cry over nothing.
lisa, You think I was crying?     This is just my allergies.
derek,Uh huh.     What are you allergic to?
lisa,"Men, apparently. Actually it's more like they're allergic to me."
26.,CONTINUED:
derek,Boyfriend trouble?
lisa,"It's stupid really.  This guy I've been seeing just calls and dumps me. Middle of the day. No warning. No explanation. Just ""I don't think we should see each other anymore."""
derek,OUCH!!! That's pretty cold.    How long were you together?
lisa,"Two months. small laugh) Actually, it was one of my longer lasting relationships. I don't know what it is but sooner or later I just seem to scare men off.  I'm starting to think there's something wrong with me."
derek," Nothing wrong with you. Your boyfriend's a fool, that's all."
lisa,I wish I could believe that.
derek,Maybe you just haven't met the right guy yet.
lisa,I'm beginning to think all the good ones are taken. D
erek,"Look, I'm no expert but if it didn't work out, maybe it wasn't meant to be. When the right guy comes along... you'll know it."
27.,CONTINUED: 
lisa,Is that how it was with you and Beth?
derek,"Actually, yeah.      We both knew pretty quick."
lisa,Love at first sight?
derek,It does happen.
isa,Great.     Now I'm jealous.
derek,Why?
lisa,"She's got it all.   Perfect husband, perfect child, perfect marriage."
erek,"Nobody's perfect. There are problems in every relationship. The important thing is to keep moving forward. trying to buck her up) Don't get down on yourself. You're a bright, attractive girl. Any man would be lucky to have you."
lisa,"Oh, yeah.     Right."
derek,"No, really. If I was single..."
lisa,But you're not.
erek,I just meant...
lisa,I know. You're just trying to make me feel better.  And you have.
28.,CONTINUED: 
derek, Hang in there. It'll happen.
ben,What was that all about?
derek,Poor kid got dumped by her boyfriend.
ben,Really? I wouldn't mind taking up the slack. That is one hot piece of ass there.  Like you haven't noticed.
derek," Hey, I'm a happily married man.   And so are you."
ben,Doesn't mean we can't look.
derek,"Ben, if you're looking to start something with that girl..."
29.,CONTINUED: 
ben,You saw her first?
derek,Fuck off.
ben,"Besides, I don't think I'm her type.     Now you on the other hand..."
erek,"Ben, do me a favor..."
ben,All I'm just sayin' is a lot of these single gals see the work place as a hunting ground. cocking his finger like a gun) And this one's got you in the cross hairs.
30.,CONTINUED:
beth,"On your way home, can you pick up those Baby Einstein DVD's for you know who."
derek,I'll have to do it tomorrow.      Office party's tonight.
beth,"I forgot. Well, if you drink too much, take a cab, okay? D EREK If it's anything like last year, I'll be home early.  Kyle, I want you to eat this."
kyle,Santa!
derek,"Yeah, Santa. And he's coming soon. So eat. Don't you know Santa only brings presents to boys who eat all their food?"
31.,CONTINUED:
lisa, This seat taken?
derek, No. Be my guest...
lisa, Really?
derek,We used to cut loose here after a long day at work.
lisa,"Work hard, play hard.   Right?"
derek, How's that boyfriend trouble coming?
lisa,"Keep moving forward, right? D EREK Exactly."
lisa,"How about you, Derek?   What's the grand plan?"

derek,I'm sure everybody's glad you decided to show up.
lisa,Even you?
derek,"What do you mean ""even me?"" I'm your number one supporter around here."
34.,CONTINUED: 
lisa, Uh oh.
erek,How did that get there?
lisa," Maybe a quick one on the cheek? If we don't, people will really suspect there's something going on."
derek,Guess we'll just have to take that chance.
lisa, Coward.
ben,"You're not thinking about bailing, are you? Fun's just getting started. Remember last year? Sally Sloane did a table dance. H e indicates a pretty secretary LAUGHING and accepting another drink."

beth,"At first I couldn't even conceive of it. They've always seemed to be so much in love, totally devoted to each other."
derek,Tim... told her?
eth,Just blurted it out last night when he came home from work. Then he said he was moving out. You know they've got three kids. Poor Rachel's a wreck.
derek,Yeah.    That's tough.
beth,Tough?    It's a disaster.   If it was me...
derek,"Beth, you know I'd never cheat on you."
beth,I know.
derek,Tim's an idiot. B ETH He's a son of a bitch.  What did you want to tell me?
derek,Forget it. Just a little problem at work.     
44.,DEREK Nothing I can't take care of.
ben,Why didn't you tell me?
derek,There was nothing to tell.
ben,"Nothing to tell? She grabbed your cock? Flashed her tits in your car? Come on, man. I thought I was your best friend."
derek,You think this is funny?
ben,"I just... jeez. I mean, I kinda got she was interested but I never figured she'd..."
derek,"What the hell did I do?    I was nice to her, that's all."
en,"Sure you didn't lead her on? Just a little? I mean, a pretty girl... it would be normal..."
derek,I didn't do a damn thing.

derek,Thanks.   You're a big help.
ben,Sorry... What are you going to do?
derek,Report it to Human Resources...
45.,CONTINUED:
ben,Get her fired?
derek,I don't have a choice.
ben,I'd be very careful if I were you. What if she makes trouble and says you came on to her? D erek gives Ben a look.       C'mon man...
erek,Then I need to get my side on the record first.
ben, Wouldn't it be cheaper to just have her killed?
secretary,"Morning, Mister Charles."
derek,"Hi, Connie. Is Hank in?     I need to talk to him."
hank, Derek? That you?
46.,CONTINUED:
derek,"Hey, Hank."
hank,What's up?
derek,"Well, it's sort of a personal matter.   I need to talk to you about one of the temps, Lisa Sheridan."
hank,Right.   She worked your desk for awhile.
derek," Listen, Hank, this going to be a little awkward..."
hank,"If you're here to file a complaint about her performance, save your breath. Her agency called this morning and said she wouldn't be coming in any more. They already sent over a replacement. D EREK  She quit? They give a reason?"
hank,No. Did you have some kind of a problem with her?
derek,"Well, I just thought she was unqualified, sort of in over her head. But if she already quit..."

derek, Yeah.
hank,Anything else?
derek,No.   I guess not.
47.,CONTINUED: 
hank,How's the new house?
derek,New house is great. a smile) Couldn't be better.

derek,She quit.
ben,Really?
derek,Yeah.

beth,"God,   it's after three. That's the last time   I'm going out on New Years Eve. Next   year we'll celebrate here at home. Just   you, me and Kyle."
derek,I'm just gonna check my e-mail and come to bed.
beth,Can't it wait?
derek,It's already tomorrow in Berlin. Ganz was supposed to send me his approval. That's probably him.
49.,CONTINUED:
beth,Ganz?
derek, Nothing. I gotta get a new spam blocker.
beth,Forget it. He'll call you in the morning. Come to bed.
50.,CONTINUED:
beth,Remember the last time Joe had one of his weekend work retreats?
derek,How could I forget?   I had a hangover for a week after.
beth,Any women coming this year?
derek,"No, just the usual suspects. Joe says it's going to be a male bonding experience."
beth,"I can just picture you guys in the hotel jacuzzi, getting in touch with your innermost feelings."
derek," Hopefully, they'll all get drunk and crash early. Or if I'm really lucky... drown in the jacuzzi."
beth,Call me tonight.
51.,CONTINUED:
derek,I will.
derek,I didn't order this.
waitress,"It's from the lady at the bar. D erek turns and peers at the crowded bar area. He catches a flash of a young woman in a tight dress seated on a stool. But a crowd of people move into his line of vision and when they clear, the woman is gone."
joe,"Derek, you okay?"
derek,I'm fine.      Just thought I saw somebody.
joe,Somebody you know?     Or somebody you'd like to know?
ben,No way.   You can't tempt this guy.
oe,Who could blame him with a wife like Beth.
52.,CONTINUED:
derek,"Speaking of Beth, I said I'd give her a call before she puts Kyle to bed. I'll be right back."
joe,Hurry back. This party's just getting started.
derek,"Hey, honey. It's me."
beth,How's the male bonding?
derek,"They're all getting wasted. Any minute now, Joe's going to suggest the Jacuzzi."
beth,"Well, if your future depends on putting on a bathing suit and hot tubbing it with a bunch of drunks... Derek? You there?"
beth,Wait.   Kyle wants to say good night.
derek, They're yelling for me to come back.
beth,It'll just take a second...
53.,CONTINUED:
derek," Beth, I'll call you later."
beth,I'll be in bed -- Derek?
lisa,I can always tell from the pained look on your face when you're talking to Beth.
derek, How did you know I'd be here?
lisa,I've got my sources. slight frown) What's wrong? You don't look happy to see me.
derek,Why did you come here?
lisa,You said you could never be with someone you work with.  That's why I quit. So we could be together.
derek," Lisa, you need to leave."
54.,"LISA Call security? What would Joe and Ben and the others think? I'll tell you what they'd think. They'd think we arranged it. And in a way, we did."
lisa,"One of us   has to take control and I guess it's me.    So you go back, say your good nights to   the boys and I'll be waiting in"
derek,I'm not coming to your room.
lisa,Would you rather I came to yours?
derek,You're crazy... sick.      You need help.

lisa,"Derek, not so loud.   You'll cause a scene."
derek,That's exactly what we Right.   A scene. need.
lisa,What are you doing?
derek,What I   should have done last night. Taking   you inside to tell Joe and the others   whatever you want. They'll know you're   out of your mind. H e yanks her toward the door.
lisa, Why are you trying to ruin this?
erek,THERE IS NO THIS!!!
lisa,Don't say that.
derek,Godammit!
lisa,What's wrong with you?   You're acting like a stranger.
61.,CONTINUED: 
derek,"Yeah! That's exactly what I am. A stranger, a person you don't know. Now either go inside and tell them your bullshit lies or get the hell out of here."

64.,"REYES CONTINUED: This girl you barely know, works in your office, fantasizes you're having an affair and when you reject her, she tries to commit suicide in your bed."
derek,"I know how it sounds but, yeah, that's pretty much it."
reyes,This affair...
derek,There WAS NO affair.
reyes,So she just... made it up in her head? With no help from you?
derek,"Maybe I was too nice to her, said something she took the wrong way, I don't know. All I know is I did not lead her on."
reyes,And you had no idea she'd be at the hotel?
derek,None. I don't even know how she got in my room.
reyes,Apparently she told one of the housekeepers she was your wife and lost her key.
derek,Doesn't that prove she did this on her own?
reyes,All it proves is she lost her key.
derek,She never had a key.
reyes,"Look, Mister Charles, I don't care if you were or weren't banging this girl. I just need to get your version for my report.   "
65.,"REYES Besides, if it's a question of innocence, I'm not the one you have to convince. D EREK What do you mean?"
reyes,Let's just say I wouldn't like to explain a situation like this to my husband.
derek,How is she?
reyes,"They pumped her out in time. Doctor says she's groggy and disoriented. Probably tomorrow they'll move her out of ICU and up to the fifth floor for a psychiatric evaluation. All suicides are put on 72 hour hold, it's standard."
erek,Did she say anything?
reyes,"As a matter of fact, she was lucid long enough to give the doctor a name to call in case of emergency. He wrote it down. Here."
66.,CONTINUED:
beth, Tell me everything.   From the beginning.
beth,How could you let this happen?
derek,You think I encouraged it?
beth,Maybe you liked it.
derek,Beth...
beth,What man wouldn't? The attentions of a pretty young girl? I can just see those adoring blue eyes batting at you every time you told her how pretty she looked or what a nice dress --
derek,"Stop it, Beth. You know I never said those things."
beth,You must have said something. Done something to give her the idea.
derek,"If I did, it wasn't intentional. B"
eth,"She was in your bed, Derek! You spent the night together and you want me to believe nothing happened?"
67.,CONTINUED:
derek,I was passed out... drunk.     Nothing happened.
beth,"Damn you, Derek.   Damn you."
derek,"I love you, Beth. I love Kyle and the life we have together. I would never do anything to screw that up. This girl is disturbed. She's seriously disturbed and for some reason, she fixated on me. B ETH Why?"
derek,I don't know. She's crazy.
beth,"You should have told me. From the very beginning, you should have told me."
derek,I know.
beth,Why didn't you?
derek,At first I thought it was no big deal. And then... I was just embarrassed. I didn't know how to explain it to you without looking...
beth,Guilty?
derek,I said I was wrong.
beth,"Did she know about us, Derek?"
derek,What?
68.,CONTINUED: 
beth,How we met?
derek,"Don't do this, Beth.    You'll make yourself sick."
beth,I'm already sick.

reyes,Miss Reynolds? I'm Monica Reyes.
lisa,Come in. I'm sorry I'm such a mess but they won't let me take a shower or wash my hair.  Apparently I'm still on suicide watch.
reyes,I'm a police officer assigned to your case. How are you feeling?
lisa,"Well, still a bit groggy from the medication. But it isn't stopping me from feeling ashamed for all the trouble I've caused."
reyes,Do you feel like talking about the other night?
lisa,Have you spoken to Derek?
reyes,Yes.
lisa,And he's all right?
reyes,Relatively speaking.
isa,When can I see him?
eyes,See him?
lisa,Derek.
reyes,I'm afraid that's not possible.
70.,CONTINUED: 
lisa,Why?
reyes,"Miss Sheridan, I don't think Mister Charles wants to speak to you or continue any kind of contact."
lisa,Then why did he send these? Really?
reyes, He sent you flowers? L ISA Peonies.   My favorite.
reyes,When did these show up?
lisa,"A few hours ago.    They're lovely, aren't they?"
reyes,"Can you tell me what happened at the hotel, why you were there."
lisa,Didn't Derek tell you?
reyes,I'd like to hear your version.
lisa,There's not a lot to tell. We got together at the hotel and you can guess what we did.
eyes,Slept together.    Had sex.
71.,CONTINUED: 
lisa,Of course.
reyes,Derek denies it.
lisa,"He's just being a gentleman, trying to protect me."
reyes,I see.     Go on.
lisa,"The next day when Derek told me his wife wouldn't give him a divorce and that we could never see each other again, I guess I over reacted. BEAT) I didn't realize he was just being noble."
reyes,Noble?
lisa,"He was thinking about his little boy, Kyle... what the breakup might do to him. He's not even two, you know. My parents broke up when I was pretty young. It leaves a scar that never really heals."
reyes,So you believe Mister Charles is in love with you? L
isa,Read the card. Derek and I belong together and nothing can change that. But I do feel bad about his wife.
eyes,You do?
lisa,I'm not a home-wrecker. I'm not stealing him away. Their marriage is dead and Beth is in denial. It can't be easy to find out that the man she loves is in love with another woman. I just hope she doesn't do something foolish. strange smile) You know the old saying.
72.,CONTINUED: 
reyes,What's that?
lisa,"""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."""
reyes,You take it easy now.   We'll talk again.
joe,I don't have to tell you how an incident like this could impact the company. Even the slightest whiff of impropriety...
derek,"There was no impropriety, Joe. This is just the sick fantasy of a very disturbed girl."
joe,Who might retaliate by hitting us with a sexual harassment lawsuit.
derek,"There was no sexual harassment. If anything, I'm the one who was sexually harassed.  I can't believe this is happening to me. It's like a nightmare."
joe,"By now, you're probably wishing you had fucked her."
73.,CONTINUED:
derek,"Goddamit, Joe, if there's an injured party here, it's me."
joe,"Derek, calm down. I believe you and you know I'll back you up all the way. But if I find out there was something going on, I won't have a choice."
derek,That's not going to happen because there's nothing to find out.
oe,Good. Then you have nothing to worry about. Meantime I'm going to put Ben on the Ganz account.
derek,But Ganz is my client --
joe,"Look, maybe you should take some time off. Just til this blows over."
marge,"Sorry to interrupt. Derek, there's a Detective Reyes here to see you."
derek,She obviously ordered the flowers for herself.
reyes,With your credit card.
derek,My secretary keeps all my personal information on her computer. Lisa must have accessed it when she was working my desk.
74.,CONTINUED:
reyes,There's more.
derek,More?
reyes,This is a print out of Lisa's blog. It's sort of a diary she was keeping.
erek,What?
reyes,You can read them for yourself but I should warn you they're a little... X- rated.
derek," This is... none of this ever happened. I was never at her apartment. I never even touched her, let alone did any of this..."
reyes,"According to those entries, you're quite the accomplished lover, Mister Charles. And you made promises to her, promises to divorce your wife and marry her..."
derek,You can't possibly believe this.
75.,CONTINUED: 
reyes,Whether I believe it or not is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is that she believes it.
derek,There's got to be something I can do to protect myself... my family.
reyes,You could file a restraining order.    But that may not be necessary.
derek,Why not?
lisa,Lisa's left town. She was released in the custody of an older sister yesterday. Her sister flew down from San Francisco and took her back. Lisa's agreed to check herself into a neuropsychiatric hospital up there.
derek," Well, I can't say I'm unhappy to hear she's gone. Maybe now she can get the help she needs."
reyes,"W ith any luck, Mister Charles, you'll never hear from her again."
derek," ""Four little ducks went out one day... over the hill and far away..."""
beth,"You've got our cell numbers so if there's any problem, don't hesitate to call us, okay?"
derek,"Come on, honey.     Samantha knows what to do, don't you?"
samantha,I've got four little brothers.    Trust me. I'm really good at this.
beth, I don't know. Maybe we should...
derek,"No way. Do you know how hard it was to get these reservations? Come on, we agreed. This is an important night. And I am not gonna waste you in that outfit.  She looks fantastic, doesn't she?"
samantha,Like a movie star. D erek takes Beth by the arm.

lisa,"What? Beth told me to drop by. That's strange. Oh well, I have something for Kyle. I'll just run up and give it to him."
samantha,You can't.     He's sleeping.
lisa,"Oh, I won't wake him."

reyes,"Apparently Lisa stole her sister's ID to buy a ticket and board a plane to LA earlier today, then used her sister's credit card to rent a car. The sister didn't even know she was gone until a few hours ago. She said Lisa had been doing well in therapy. She didn't know she checked herself out this morning..."

reyes,She didn't physically harm him.
derek,"No, but she could have. Is that the message she's trying to send? R EYES Either that or...maybe she was trying to show you she could love him. off Derek's sickened reaction) People like Lisa... their emotions can turn on a dime. What you don't want is her feelings for you to change to rage. I don't know. But there's a good chance she'll try to get in touch. If she does, you need to call me right away. Meanwhile, you might want to beef up your home security."
