Speaker,Dialogue
beverly,"Not hard to imagine, faced with Eliot's first wife, lovely Viv, how Crane or Berryman might have reacted, just foot-raced to the nearest bridge; Olympian Suicidalists."
beverly,My wife takes pills and I drink. That's the bargain we've struck.
beverly,The reasons why we partake are anymore inconsequential.
johnna,"Yes, sir."
beverly,May I ask how?
johnna,He had a heart attack. Fell into a flatbed truck full of wine grapes.
beverly,Wine grapes. In Oklahoma.   I'm sorry.
violet,Bev...?!
beverly,Yes?
violet,"Did you pullish? Did you...Oh, goddamn                * it... did. You. Are the police here?"
beverly,No...
violet,Am I looking through window? A window?
beverly,Can you come here?
violet,Oh.    Hello.
beverly,"Johnna, the young woman I told you about."
violet,You tell me she's a woman. Wo-man. Whoa-man.
beverly,That I'm hiring --
violet,"Oh, you hire women's now the thing. I thought you meant the other woman."
beverly,"To cook and clean, take you to the clinic and to the --"
violet," In the int'rest of ...civil action, your par-tic-u-lars way of speak- king, I thought you meant you had thought a whoa-man to be HIRED!"
beverly,I don't understand you.
violet, Hello.
johnna,Hello.
violet,I'm sorry.  Like this.
johnna,"Yes, ma'am."
violet,You're very pretty.
johnna,Thank you.
violet,"Are you an Indian? ""August"" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft    6. 8   CONTINUED:                                                       8"
johnna,"Yes, ma'am."
violet,Do you think I'm pretty?
johnna,"Yes, ma'am."
violet, Like this?
beverly,Careful...
violet,"You're the house now. I'm sorry, I took some medicine for my mussss... muscular."
beverly,"Why don't you go back to bed, sweetheart?"
violet,Why don't you go fuck a fucking sow's ass?
beverly,All right.
violet,I'm sorry. I'll be sickly sweet. I'm soooooooo sweet. In-el-abrially sweet.
beverly,We keep unusual hours here. Try not to differentiate between night and day. You won't be able to keep a healthy routine.
johnna,I need the work.
beverly,"I myself require very little attention, thrive without it, sort of a human cactus. My wife has been diagnosed with a touch of cancer, so she'll need to be driven to Tulsa for her final chemotherapy treatments. You're welcome to use that American- made behemoth parked out in the drive. Welcome to make use of anything, everything, all this garbage we've acquired, our life's work. Do you have any questions?"
johnna,What kind of cancer?
beverly,"My God, I nearly neglected the punch line: mouth cancer."
johnna,What pills does she take?
beverly,"Valium. Vicodin. Darvon, Darvocet. Percodan, Percocet. Xanax for fun. OxyContin in a pinch. And of course Diluadid. I can't forget Diluadid."
jean,...Mom?
barbara,Mmm...
jean,You didn't hear the phone?
barbara,"If it's your father, tell him to fuck off."
jean,It's Aunt Ivy in Oklahoma.
barbara,...Ivy? ...what's wrong?
ivy,Mom...?  Mom?
violet,...You've been out there...?
ivy,She's on her way.
violet,What'd you tell her?
ivy,"I told her Dad was missing. ""August"" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   11. 14   CONTINUED:                                                      14"
violet,Did you tell her how long he'd been missing?
ivy,Five days.
violet,What did she say?
ivy,She said she was on her way.
violet,"Goddamn it, Ivy, what did she say?"
ivy,She said she was on her way.
violet,"You're hopeless.  Goddamn your father for putting me through this. Seen that office of his, all that mess? I can't make heads or tails of it. He hired this Indian for some goddamn reason and now I have a stranger in my house. What's her name?"
ivy,Johnna.   Who was on the phone?
violet,"This house is falling apart, something about the basement or the sump pump or the foundation. I don't know anything about it. I can't do this by myself."
ivy,I called Karen.
violet,What did she say?
ivy,She said she'd try to get here.
violet,"She'll be a big fat help, just like you.  I need Barb."
ivy,What's Barb going to be able to do?
violet,What did you do to your hair?
ivy,I had it straightened.
violet,You had it straightened.    Why would anybody do that?
ivy,I just wanted a change.
violet,"You're the prettiest of my three girls, but you always look like a schlub. Why don't you wear makeup?"
ivy,Do I need makeup?
violet,All women need makeup. Don't let anybody tell you different. The only woman who was pretty enough to go without makeup was Elizabeth Taylor and she wore a ton. Stand up straight.
ivy,Mom.
violet,Your shoulders are slumped and your hair's all straight and you don't wear makeup. You look like a lesbian.
ivy,"I'm not looking for a man. ""August"" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   13. 14   CONTINUED:                                                   14"
violet,"There are a lot of losers out there, don't think I don't know that. But just because you got a bad one last time doesn't mean --"
ivy,Barry wasn't a loser.
violet,"Barry was an asshole. I warned you from the jump, first time you brought him over here in his little electric car with his stupid orange hair and that turban --"
ivy,It wasn't a turban --
violet,You work at a college. Don't tell me there aren't people coming through the door of that library every day.
ivy,You want me to marry some eighteen year old boy from one of these hick towns?
violet,"They still have teachers at TU, right? They did when your father taught there."
ivy,I wasn't counting.
violet,Like a son-of-a-bitch.   My tongue is on fire.
ivy,"Are you supposed to be smoking? ""August"" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   14. 14   CONTINUED:                                                    14"
violet,Is anybody supposed to smoke?
ivy,You have cancer of the mouth.
violet,Just leave it alone.
violet,"Course I'm scared. And you are a comfort, sweetheart. Thank God one of my girls stayed close to home."
ivy,Aunt Mattie Fae's here.
violet,She means to come in here and tell me what's what.
ivy,I don't know how Uncle Charlie puts up with it.
violet,He smokes a lot of grass.
ivy,He does?
violet,He smokes a lot of grass.
mattie fae,"I told Vi, ""Take all those goddamn books he's so fond of and make a big pile in the front yard and have yourself a bonfire."""
charlie,You don't burn a man's books.
mattie fae,"You do, if the situation calls for it."
charlie,The man's books didn't do anything.
mattie fae,"You get any ideas about just up and taking off, Charlie Aiken, you better believe --"
charlie,I'm not going anywhere.
mattie fae,"I'm saying if you did, I'll give you two days to get your head straight and then it's all going up in a blaze of glory. Not that you have any books lying around. I don't think I've ever seen you read a book in my life."
charlie,That bother you?
mattie fae,What's the last book you read?
charlie,"Beverly was a teacher; teachers read books, I'm in the upholstery business."
mattie fae,"Ah, sweetie. Your daddy's done this before. Just takes off, no call, nothing. I told your mother, ""You pack that son-of-a-bitch's bags and have `em waiting for him on the front porch."""
mattie fae,Where's your mother?
ivy,Upstairs.
charlie,"They've always had trouble, Ivy."
mattie fae,"He'll come back again, I know he will, he always does. Beverly is a very complicated man."
ivy,Kind of like Charles.
charlie,"Yes, like Little Charles. Exactly --"
mattie fae,Oh.   He's nothing like Little Charles.
charlie,She just means in their sort of quiet complicated ways --
mattie fae,"Little Charles isn't complicated, he's just unemployed."
charlie,He's an observer.
mattie fae,All he observes is the television.  Why is it so dark in here?
charlie,So you can't even see Ivy's point? That Little Charles and Beverly share some kind of... complication.
mattie fae,"You have to be smart to be complicated. ""August"" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   17. 16   CONTINUED:                                                    16"
charlie,Are you saying our boy isn't smart?
mattie fae,"Yes, that's what I'm saying."
charlie,"Hell, yes, I'm sweating, it's ninety degrees in here."
mattie fae,Feel my back.
charlie,I don't want to feel your back.
mattie fae,Sweat is just dripping down my back.
charlie,I believe you.
mattie fae,Feel it.
charlie,No.
mattie fae,"Come on, put your hand here --"
charlie,Goddamn it --
mattie fae,Sweat's just dripping...

mattie fae,Is it that long since we've been here?
charlie,Do you know its purpose? You can't tell if it's night or day.
ivy,I think that's the purpose.
charlie,Don't do that. This isn't your place.
mattie fae,The body needs sunlight.
violet,"They checked the hospitals, no Beverly."
mattie fae,Who's this now? The highway patrol?                    *
violet,"No, the sheriff, the Gilbeau boy."
ivy,What else did he say?
violet,The boat's missing.
ivy,Dad's boat?
violet,I asked the sheriff to send a deputy out to the dock to check if anybody had seen him and his boat is gone.
jean,I'm gonna grab a smoke.
barbara,You've encouraged that.
bill,I haven't encouraged anything.
barbara,"You admire her for getting hooked at fourteen, makes her seem even more mature."
bill,Suppose your mom's turned on the air conditioner?
barbara,You kidding? Remember the parakeets?
bill,The parakeets?
barbara,"I didn't tell you about the parakeets? She got a parakeet for some insane reason, and the little fucker croaked after two days. So she went to the pet store and raised hell and they gave her another parakeet. That one died after one day.  So she went back and they gave her a third parakeet and that one died too. So the chick from the pet store came out here to see just what in the hell this serial parakeet killer was doing to bump off these birds."
bill,And?
barbara,The heat. It was too hot. They were dying from the heat.
bill,Jesus.
barbara,"These are tropical birds, all right? They live in the fucking tropics."
bill,Are you ready for this?
barbara,No.    No way.
charlie,Violet's a Clapton fan?

charlie,I know that.
mattie fae,Then get your own beer.
johnna, I'll get it.
mattie fae,"I don't believe you. Watchin' a ball game, drinkin' beers. You have any sense of what's going on around you?"
charlie,Am I supposed to sit here like a statue? You're drinking whiskey.
mattie fae,I'm having a cocktail.
charlie,You're drinking straight whiskey!
mattie fae,Just... show a little class.
barbara,...Mom?

bill,Fine...
violet,Barb...

bill,No word then?
barbara,Did you see Bill and Jean?
violet,"Yes.   Hi, Bill."

mattie fae,Isn't she the limit? Look at her boobs!
jean,"O-kay, we've all stared at my tits now."
mattie fae,They're just so darn big.
violet,You're just the prettiest thing. Thank you for coming to see me.
barbara,"Ivy, I didn't see you up there."
ivy,It looked crowded.
barbara,"God, you look good.   Doesn't she look good, Bill?"
violet,"She had it straightened. Barbara, or Bill, it doesn't matter, I need you to go through Beverly's things, help me with this paperwork."
barbara,"Well... we can do that, Mom."
ivy,I was going to help with --

barbara, Which room are you in?
mattie fae,We're gonna head home soon.
violet,You're going back to Tulsa?
mattie fae,"We have to, we left in such a rush we didn't get anyone to take care of the damn dogs. Anyway, I know you want to spend some time with these girls."
violet,"How about Little Charles, can't he take care of the dogs?"
charlie,"Well, yeah, I guess he could --"
mattie fae,We talked about this.
barbara,"Mom, can Jean stay in the attic?"
violet,"No, that's where what's-her-name lives."
ivy,Johnna.
barbara,Who's Johnna?
violet,She's the Indian who lives in my attic.
barbara,She's the what?
jean,Hi...
johnna,Hello.
jean,I like your necklace.
jean,Did you make that?
johnna,My grandma.
jean,Is there something in it?
johnna,My umbilical cord.
jean,"Ewww, are you serious?"
johnna,"When a Cheyenne is born, their umbilical cord is dried and sewn into a pouch. ""August"" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft    27. 21   CONTINUED:                                                    21"
jean,You're Cheyenne. Like that movie Powwow Highway. Did you see that?
bill,This was when?
violet,"Saturday morning. The Indian girl made us biscuits and gravy. We ate some, he walked out the door, this door right there. Got into his truck. And that was it."
barbara,He just left...?
violet,"I went to bed Saturday night, got up Sunday... still no Beverly. I didn't make much of it, thought he'd gone out on a bender."
barbara,Why would he do that? Not like he couldn't drink at home. Unless you were riding his ass.
violet,"I never said anything to him about his drinking, never got on him about it. ""August"" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   28. 22   CONTINUED:                                                      22"
barbara,Really.
viloet,"Barbara, I swear. He could drink himself into obliv-uh, obliv-en-um..."
barbara,Oblivion.
bill,"So Sunday, still no sign of him..."
violet,"Yes, Sunday. No sign. I started getting worried, don'tcha know. That's when I got worked up about that safety deposit box.   We kept an awful lot of cash in that box, some expensive jewelry. I had a diamond ring in that box appraised at seven thousand dollars --"
barbara,"Wait, wait, wait, I'm missing something. Why do you care about a safety deposit box?"
violet,"Well, I know what you'll say about this, but, your father and I had an urge-ment... arrangement. If something were to ever happen to one of us, the other one would go empty that box."
barbara,Because...
bill,"The money and jewelry gets rolled into the estate, bank seals the box until probate is settled. Can take months."
violet,"Right, that's right --"
barbara,"You're such a fucking cynic. ""August"" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   29. 22   CONTINUED:                                                   22"
violet,I knew you would disapprove --
barbara,"Okay, what about the safety deposit box?"
violet,"I had to wait for the bank to open on Monday. And after I emptied that box, I called the police and reported him missing. Monday morning."
barbara,And you only had Ivy call me today?
violet,"I didn't want to worry you, honey --"
bill,Yes.
violet,"No. And we fought enough... you know... but no, he just left."
barbara,Maybe he needed some time away from you.
violet,That's nice of you to say.
barbara,Good old unfathomable Dad.
violet,"Oh. That man. What I first fell of with -- fell in love with, you know, was his mystery. I thought it was sexy as hell.  You knew he was the smartest one in the room, knew if he just said something... knock you out. But he'd just stand there, little smile on his face... not say a word. Sexy."
bill,You can't think of anything unusual --
violet,"He hired this woman. He didn't ask me, just hired this woman to come live in our house. Few days before he left."
barbara,You don't want her here.
violet,She's a stranger in my house. There's an Indian in my house.
bill,"You have a problem with Indians, Violet?"
violet,I don't know what to say to an Indian.
barbara,"They're called Native Americans now, Mom."
violet,Who makes that decision?
barbara,"It's what they like to be called. ""August"" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   31. 23   CONTINUED:                                                   23"
violet,They aren't any more native than me.
barbara,"In fact, they are."
violet,What's wrong with Indian?
barbara,Why's it so hard to call people --
violet,"Let's just call the dinosaurs ""Native Americans"" while we're at it."
barbara,"She may be an Indian, but she makes the best goddamn apple pie I ever ate."
violet,He hired a cook. It doesn't make any sense. We don't eat.
barbara,"And now you get biscuits and gravy. Kind of nice, huh?"
violet,"Nice for you, now. But you'll be gone soon enough, never to return."
barbara, Mom...
violet,When was the last time you were here?
barbara,"I'm very dutiful, Mom, I call, I write, I send presents --"

violet,"Because you're ""dutiful."""
bill,"All right, now --"
violet,I don't care about you two. I'd like to see my granddaughter every now --
barbara,"Well, you're seeing her now."
violet,But your father. You broke his heart when you moved away.
barbara,That is wildly unfair.
violet,"I'm sure you'd prefer to think that Santy Claus brought you presents at Christmas, too. If you'd had more than one child, you'd know a parent always has favorites. Mattie Fae was my mother's favorite. Big deal. I got used to it. You were your Daddy's favorite.

barbara,What was I supposed to do?! Colorado gave Bill twice the money he was making at TU --
bill,Why are we even getting into this?
barbara,You think Daddy wouldn't have jumped at the chance Bill got?
violet,You're wrong there. You never would've gotten Beverly Weston out of Oklahoma.
barbara,Daddy gave me his blessing.
violet,`S what he told you.
barbara,"Now you're going to tell me the true story, some terrible shit Daddy said behind my back?"
bill,"Hey, enough. Everybody's on edge --"
violet,Beverly didn't say terrible things behind your back --
bill,"Vi, come on --"
violet,"He just told me he's disappointed in you because you settled. He thought                  * you had talent, as a writer.                         *"

barbara,Are you high?
violet,Excuse me.
barbara,I mean literally. You taking something?
violet,A muscle relaxer.
barbara,Listen to me: I will not go through this with you again.
violet,I don't know what you're talking about.
barbara,These fucking pills? Calls at three                     * AM about people in your backyard?
violet,Stop yelling at me!

barbara,"I don't want to know if you are or not, I'm just saying I won't go --"
violet,I'm not.   I'm in pain.
barbara,Because of your mouth.
violet,"Yes, because my mouth burns from the chemotheeeahh --"
barbara,Are you in a lot of pain?
violet,"Yes, I'm in pain. I have got... gotten cancer. In my mouth. And it burns like a... bullshit. And Beverly's disappeared and you're yelling at me."
barbara,I'm not yelling at you.
violet,You couldn't come home when I got cancer but as soon as Beverly disappeared you rushed back --
barbara,I'm sorry... you're right. I'm sorry.
jean,"Hi, again... Am I bugging you?"
johnna,"No, do you need something?"
jean,"No, I thought maybe you'd like to smoke a bowl with me?"

johnna,Okay.
jean,Okay. You sure?
johnna,I don't think so.

jean,"He's fucking one of his grad students. I don't care --aside from the pathetic English and Humanities cliche, like all those departmental dicks fucking their students -- he can fuck who he wants and that's who teachers meet, students. He was just a turd the way he didn't give Mom a chance to respond or anything. What sucks now is she's on my ass cause she's afraid I'll have some post-divorce freak-out and become some heroin addict or shoot everybody at school. Or God forbid, lose my virginity. I don't know what it is about Dad splitting that put Mom on hymen patrol.  Don't say anything about Mom and Dad; okay? They want to play it low key."
bill,Ivy leave?
barbara, I'd forgotten about the lightning bugs.
bill,Look what I found...
barbara,We have copies.
bill,"I don't remember a hardback edition. Think this is worth something... first edition, hardback, mint condition? Academy Fellowship, Wallace Stevens Award? This book was a big deal."
barbara,It wasn't that big a deal.
bill,"In those circles, it was."
barbara,Those are small circles.
bill,"""Dedicated to my Violet."" That's nice. Christ, probably every word he wrote after this he had to be thinking, ""What are they going to say, are they going to compare it to Meadowlark?"""
barbara,Jean go to bed?
bill,"Just turned out the light. You'd think at some point, you just write something anyway and who cares what they say about it. I don't know --"

bill,Why are you bringing that up?
barbara,"They're all symptoms of your male menopause, whether it's you struggling with the ""creative question,"" or screwing a girl who still wears a retainer."

barbara,"The subject is me! I am the subject, you narcissistic motherfucker! I am in pain! I need help!"
bill,I've copped to being a narcissist. We're the products of a narcissistic generation.
barbara,"You can't do it, can you? You can't talk about me for two seconds --"

bill,I'm not necessarily keen on the notion of saying things that would hurt you.
barbara,Like what?
bill,"We have enough on our hands with your parents right now, let's not revisit this."
barbara,"When did we visit this to begin with? I still don't know what happened. Do I bore you, intimidate you, disgust you? Is this just about the pleasures of young flesh, teenage pussy? I really need to know."
bill,"You need to know now? With Beverly missing, and your mother crazy as a loon? You want to do this now?"
barbara,You're right. I'll just hunker down for a cozy night's sleep upstairs. Next to my husband.
bill,This discussion deserves our   care. And patience. We'll both be    in a better frame of mind to talk   about this once your father's come   home.
barbara,Mom?
violet,Did you call them?    I dig in call them.
barbara,Mom.    The sheriff is here.

bill,Come on.   Leave her there.
bill,What happened?
sheriff,Couple old boys running jug lines in the lake hooked him. Pulled him up.
bill,"He drowned. That's how he died, from drowning?"
sheriff,"Looks it.     Yes, sir."
bill,"Is there any way to determine if he... I mean is this an accident, or suicide --?"
sheriff,There's really no way to tell.
bill,What's your guess?
sheriff,...Suicide.
bill,How does a a person jump in the water... and choose not to swim?
jean,What about Aunt Ivy?
barbara,"I guess we'll stop on the way. Christ, I need to call Karen, too. Why the fuck am I brushing my hair?"

jean,Kind of...
karen,"I mean I'd kiss my pillow, and then I'd tell him I'd been to the doctor that day and I'd found out I was pregnant. I know how pathetic that sounds, but it was innocent enough. Then real life takes over, cause it always does --"
barbara,-- uh-huh --
karen,"Things don't work out like you planned. That pillow was a better husband than any real man I'd ever met; this parade of men fails to live up to your expectations, all of them so much less than Daddy or Bill. You punish yourself, tell yourself it's your fault you can't find a good one. I don't know how well you remember Andrew..."

barbara,"And Scientology too, right, or something like that --?"
karen,"Exactly, and finally one day, I threw it all out, I said, ""It's me, just me with my music on the stereo, my glass of wine and Bloomers my cat. I don't need anything else, I can live my life with myself."" I got my license, threw myself into my work, sold a lot of houses, and that's when I met Steve."
karen,"The best thing about him, for me, is that now what I think about is now. I live now. My focus, my life, my world is now. I don't give a care about the past anymore, the mistakes I made, the way I thought. And you can't plan the future cause as soon as you do, something happens, some terrible thing happens --"
barbara,Like your father drowning himself.
karen,"That's exactly what I mean. You take it as it comes, here and now! Steve had a huge presentation today for some big-wig government guys who could be important for his business, something he's put together for months, and as soon as we heard about Daddy, he cancelled his meeting. He has his priorities straight. And you know what the kicker is?  Do you know what the kicker --?"

ivy,"God, you're weird; it's a black suit."
violet,You look like a magician's assistant.
mattie fae,Little Charles has been talking about moving to New York. Can you picture that?
violet,Don't discourage him now --
mattie fae,He wouldn't last a day in that city. They'd tear him apart.
violet,Stop being so sensitive.
mattie fae,He overslept? For his Uncle's funeral? A noon service?
ivy,I'm sure there's more to the story --
mattie fae,Don't make excuses for him. That's what Charlie does. Thirty-seven years old and can't drive? Who can't drive?
ivy,Why are you giving away your clothes?
violet,"All this shit's going. I don't plan to spend the rest of my days looking at what used to be. I want that shit in the office gone, I want these clothes I'm never going to wear gone. I mean look at these fucking shoes --  Even if I didn't fall on my face, can you imagine anything less attractive, my swollen ankles and varicose veins?

karen,"I guess what I'm telling you is that I'm happy. I've been unhappy most of my life,   my adult life. I doubt you've been aware of that. I know our lives have led us apart, you, me and Ivy. Maybe we're not as close as, as close as some families --"
barbara,"Yeah, we really need to talk about Mom, what to do about Mom --"

steve,Number one by far. Want a shotgun?  You don't know what a shotgun is?
jean,I know what a shotgun is.
steve,"Not that kind of shotgun, here. Just put your lips right next to mine and you inhale while I exhale."
jean,Okay.
steve,Hold it.   Don't let it out.
karen,What happened?!
johnna,He was messing with Jean --
karen,"Honey, you're bleeding, you okay?"
barbara,"Jean, what are you doing up?"
jean,"We were, I don't know --"
barbara,"Johnna, what's going on?"
johnna,"He was messing with Jean, so I tuned him up."
barbara,"I'll murder you, you prick!"
steve,I didn't do anything!
barbara,You know how old that girl is?
steve, Tell them I didn't do anything!
barbara,She's fourteen years old!
jean,What is the matter with you? Will you please stop freaking out?
bill,Why don't you start at the beginning?
barbara,What are you even doing up?
bill,"Please, sweetheart, we need to know what went on here."
jean,"Nothing ""went on."" Can we just not make a federal case out of every thing? I came down for a drink, he came in... end of story. All right? ""August"" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft    119. 84   CONTINUED:                                                    84"
barbara,Just tell me what he did!
jean,He didn't do anything!    What's the                   * big deal?
bill,"The big deal, Jean, is that you're fourteen years old."
jean,Which is only a few years younger than you like `em.
barbara,"Yeah, I hate you too, you little freak!"
bill,"What's the matter with you? ""August"" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft      120. 84   CONTINUED:                                                      84"
karen,I can do without a speech.
barbara,Where is he?
karen,"Out at the car. We're leaving. Back to Florida, tonight, now. Me and Steve, together. Want to give me some grief about that?"
barbara,Now wait just a goddamn --
karen,"You better find out from Jean exactly what went on before you start pointing fingers. Cause I doubt Jean's blameless in all this. And I'm not blaming her, just cause I said she's not blameless doesn't mean I've blamed her. I'm saying she might share in the responsibility. It's not cut and dried, black and white, good and bad. It lives where everything lives: somewhere in the middle. Where the rest of us live, everyone but you."
barbara,Karen--
karen,"He's not perfect. Just like the rest of us, down here in the muck. I'm no angel myself. I've done some things I'm not proud of. Things you'll never know about. I may even have to do some things I'm not proud of again. Cause sometimes life puts you in a corner that way.  And I am   a human being, after all. Anyway.    You have your own hash to settle.    Before you start making speeches   to the rest of us."
barbara,Right...
karen,Come January... I'll be in Belize. Doesn't that sound nice?
bill,"I'm taking Jean with me, heading back to Colorado in the morning."
barbara,Okay.
bill,I'm sure you'll find a way to blame me for all this.
barbara,"Yeah, well...  I can't make it up to Jean right now. She's just going to have to wait until I get back to Boulder."
bill,"You and Jean have about forty years left to fight and make up. ""August"" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   122. 86   CONTINUED:                                                      86"
barbara," Why, what happens in forty years?"
bill,You die.
barbara,"Oh, right."
bill,I mean --
barbara,"No. Right. I fail. As a mother, as a daughter, as a wife. I fail."
bill,"No, you don't."
barbara,I've physically attacked Mom and Jean in the span of twenty-four hours. You stick around here and I'll cut off your penis.
bill,That's not funny.
barbara,"You're never coming back to me, are you, Bill?"
bill,"Never say never, but..."
barbara,But no.
bill,But no.
barbara,Even if things don't work out with you and Marsha.
bill,Cindy.
barbara,"Cindy. ""August"" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   123. 86   CONTINUED:                                                   86"
bill,Right. Even if things don't work out.
barbara,"And I'm never really going to understand why, am I?"
bill,Probably not.
ivy,Where are Bill and Jean going?
barbara,Yeah...
ivy,Is she clean?
barbara,"She's moderately clean. ""August"" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   124. 87   CONTINUED:                                                     87"
ivy,Moderately?
barbara,You don't like moderately?   Then let's say tolerably.
ivy,"Is she clean, or not?"
barbara,Back off.
ivy,I'm nervous.
barbara,"Oh Christ, Ivy, not today."
ivy,"I have to tell her, don't I? We're leaving for New York tomorrow."
barbara,That's not a good idea. For you and Charles to take this any further.
ivy,Where is this coming from?
barbara,Lot of fish in the sea. Surely you can rule out the one single man in the world you're related to.
ivy,I love the man I'm related to--
barbara,"Fuck love, what a crock of shit. People can convince themselves they love a painted rock."
johnna,Catfish.
barbara,"Bottom feeders, my favorite. You're nearly fifty years old, Ivy, you can't go to New York, you'll break a hip. Eat your catfish."
ivy,"I have lived in this town, year in and year out, hoping against hope someone would come into my life--"
barbara,Don't get all Carson McCullers on me. Now wipe that tragic look off your face and eat some catfish.
violet,What's howdy about it?
barbara,"Look, catfish for lunch.   Johnna!  You hungry?"
violet,"Ivy, you should smile.   Like me."
barbara,"Mom needs her lunch, please."
violet,I'm not hungry.
barbara,You haven't eaten anything today. You didn't eat anything yesterday.
violet,I'm not hungry.
barbara,Eat.
violet,No.
barbara,Eat it.    Mom? Eat it.
violet,No.
barbara,"Eat it, you fucker.   Eat that catfish."
violet,Go to hell.
barbara,That doesn't cut any fucking ice with me. Now eat that fucking fish.
ivy,"Mom, I have something to talk to you--"
barbara,No you don't.
ivy,Barbara--
barbara,No you don't. Shut up.    Shut the fuck up.
ivy,Please--
violet,What's to talk about?

violet,I'm not hungry.
barbara,Eat it.
violet,NO!
ivy,"Mom, I need to--!"
violet,NO!
ivy,MOM!
barbara,"EAT THE FISH, BITCH!"
ivy,"MOM, PLEASE!"
violet,Barbara...!
barbara,"Okay, fuck it, do what you want."
ivy,I have to tell you something.
barbara,Ivy's a lesbian.
ivy,Barbara--
violet,"No, you're not."
ivy,"No, I'm not--"
barbara,"Yes, you are. Did you eat your fish?"

ivy,I have something to say.
barbara,Are we breaking shit?
ivy,Charles and I --
barbara,"You don't want to break shit with me, muthah-fuckah --"
ivy,Charles and I --
barbara,Johnna?!   Little spill in here!
ivy,"Barbara, stop it!  Mom, Charles and I --"
barbara,Little Charles --
ivy,Charles and I --
barbara,Little Charles --
ivy,Barbara --
barbara,You have to say Little Charles or she won't know who you're talking about.
ivy,Little Charles and I...
violet,Little Charles and you are brother and sister. I know that.
barbara,Oh... Mom.
ivy,"What?    No, listen, Little Charles --"
violet,"I've always known that. I told you, no one slips anything by me."
ivy,Mom --
barbara,"Don't listen. ""August"" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft   130. 88   CONTINUED:                                                   88"
violet,"I knew the whole time Bev and Mattie Fae were carrying on. Charlie should have known too, if he wasn't smoking all that grass."
barbara,It's the pills talking.
violet,"Your father tore himself up over it, thirty some-odd years, but Beverly wouldn't have been Beverly if he didn't have plenty to brood about."
ivy,"Mom, what are you...?"
barbara,Oh honey...
violet,"Better you girls know now though, now you're older. Never know when someone might need a kidney."
ivy,Why in God's name did you tell me this?
violet,"Hey, what do you care?"
ivy,You're monsters.
violet,Come on now --
ivy,Monsters...
violet,Who's the injured party here?
barbara,"Ivy, listen --"
ivy,Leave me alone.
barbara,"When Mattie Fae told me, I didn't know what to do --"
barbara,I was trying to protect you --
ivy,"We'll go anyway, we'll still go away."
barbara,This is not my fault.
ivy,There's no difference.
violet,We couldn't let Ivy run off with Little Charles. Just wouldn't be right.
barbara,You knew about Daddy and Mattie Fae?
violet,"Oh sure. I never told them I knew. But your father knew. He knew I knew. But we never talked about it. I chose the higher ground.  If I'd had the chance, there at the end, I would've told him, ""I hope this isn't about Little Charles, cause you know I know all about that."" If I'd reached him at that motel, I would've said, ""You'd be better off if you quit sulking about this ancient history."""
barbara,...what motel?
violet,"I called over there on Monday after I got into that safety deposit box. But it was too late, he'd checked out."
barbara,How did you know where he was?
violet,The note. He said I could call him over at the Country Squire Motel --
barbara,He left a note?
violet,"And I did, I called him on Monday. ""August"" 9/21/12 FINAL WHITE Draft       133. 91   CONTINUED:                                                       91"
barbara,After you got the money out of your                       * safety deposit box...
violet,"We had an arrangement. You have to                        * understand, for people like your                          * father and me, who never had any                          * money, ever, as kids, people from our                     * generation, that money is important.                      *"
barbara,Did the note say he was going to kill himself?
violet,"If I had my wits about me, I might've done it different. But I was, your father and me both, we were..."
barbara,You were both fucked-up... You were                       * fucked-up... You are fucked-up.                           *
violet,"You'd better understand this, you smug little ingrate. There's only one reason Beverly killed himself and that's you. Think there's any way he would've done what he did if you were still here? No, just him and me, here in this house, in the dark, left to ourselves, abandoned, wasted lifetimes devoted to your care and comfort.  So stick that knife of judgment in me, go ahead, but make no mistake, his blood is just as much on your hands as it is on mine."
barbara,"You're right, Mom.    You're the strong one."
violet,...Barbara?
barbara,No...
violet,"Barbara, please."
barbara,I'm nothing like you...
violet,"Please, Barbara."
violet,Johnna... Johnna... Johnna...
