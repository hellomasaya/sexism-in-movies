stella,"Hiya, Carrie. Gee you gave me a fright.  How long have you been there?"
carrie, What are those?
stella,"Those are my breasts, honey."
carrie, I wish I had some.
stella,"You will. `Course you'll have to wait a couple of years, but"
carrie, No I won't.
stella,"Why, sure you will."
carrie, Momma says no... Momma says good girls don't. 3
stella," Well, I'm a good girl. And besides, doesn't your mother have breasts?"
carrie,...dirtypillows.
stella,What?
carrie,Momma calls them dirtypillows. Says she's got them `cuz she was bad when she made me.
stella,"Now, honey, that's just silly. Listen  you must be real hot in that long dress. What do you say we go inside and get us some lemonade, would you like that?"
stella,C'mon.  It'll be our secret.
carrie,I can't!
stella,"Sure you can. I make it nice and sweet, and"
margaret,CAARRIEETTAAA!!!
stella,Mother!  Mother! 5
stella," I don't know... Carrie was just talking to me, and Mrs. White started screaming and..."
stella,Don't you yell at her like that! Stop that!
stella,"Mother, we've got to do something!"
stella,"Call the police? Mother, call the police!"
margaret's voice,Stop that! Stop that!
margaret's voice,Carrie!
carrie,"Yes, Momma."
margaret's voice,You come straight home from school.
carrie," I always do, Momma."
bobby,"Hey, fart-face! Hey, old praying Carrie! Praying, Carrie, praying Carrie, praying Carrie!"
fromm's voice,"What are you going to leave for us, You people in your big cars Spewing pollution into the air?"
fromm's voice,"You people with heavy feet Trampling down the wilderness? You people who peer into the back seats of our cars Hours after you come out of the back doors of your motels. Soon all we will have is each other, and that could be enough..."
fromm,...If you will let us have room enough And air enough And peace enough To love each other As you never could 10
fromm,"I must say  I must confess  this poem displays an extraordinary talent...  ...a talent extraordinary for you, Tommy Ross."
fromm,"Tommy, this is slightly different from running for a touchdown... Any criticisms?"
fromm,Carrie White?
carrie,It's... beautiful.
fromm,"`Beautiful.' `Bee-t-ti-ful!' `Oh beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain.' Is that the beautiful you mean?"
fromm,"That isn't exactly a criticism, Miss White.  Well, at least we've finally gotten Carrie White to say something!"
tommy, You suck.
fromm,Tommy? You said something?
tommy,"Yes, sir.  I said... `shucks.'"
collins,"Okay, now. This is game point."
rhonda, Twenty  Twenty.
chris, You eat shit!

collins,"What are you waiting for, Carrie?  Bell in five minutes."
carrie,Oh uh?
chris,Peer-iod! Peer-iod!
girls,Peer-iod! Peer-iod! Peer-iod! Peer-iod!
norma,14
girls,Plug it up! Plug it up! Plug it up! Plug it up!
sue,"For God's sakes, Carrie, you got your period.  Clean yourself up!"
sue," You're bleeding! You dumb pudding, you're bleeding!"
norma,She thinks they're for lipstick.
girls,"Plug it up, plug it up, plug it up, plug it up...."
collins,15
collins, Get out! Get out!
sue,It must be her first...
collins,Out!
carrie,M... M... Miss Collins...
collins,Stand up. Take care of yourself.
carrie,I'm bleeding.
collins,Damn you!
collins,Get over there! And take one!
carrie,16
collins,Never mind the coin slot... It's broken.
carrie,It hurts... my stomach...
collins, Do it! Now.
carrie,I can't. I don't know how!
collins,What...?
collins,"Carrie, don't you know...?  I'll show you."
morton,Isn't she a bit old for her...
collins,17
morton,"Ah, yes."
collins,"Morty, until a half hour ago, I don't think she knew there was such a thing."
morton,It's hard to believe in this day and age a girl in high school wouldn't know... something... the facts.
collins,"Well, knowing that mother of hers..."
morton," Miss Collins, if you'd been with us longer, you'd understand we cannot interfere with people's beliefs. As for the girls"
collins,Carrie's always been their scapegoat. So they...
morton,You'll have to do something.
collins,I will. But I understood how those girls felt. The whole thing just made me want to take the girl and shake her.
morton,Ummm.
collins,"It's just her period, for God's sake."
morton," Miss Finch, send in Cassie Wright. 18"
collins,It's Carrie White.
morton, Oh.
morton,"Come in, Cassie."
morton,"Close the door. No, wait.  I think you might take the rest of the day and go home and, uh, well... take care of yourself, Cassie."
carrie, Carrie.
morton,We're all sorry about this incident.
morton, Would you like to go to the infirmary?...
morton,...lie down for a while...
collins,I think Carrie can go home. 19
morton,Would you like a ride?
morton,We could call you a cab.
collins,"I'm sure she can walk home. And Carrie, you're excused from gym for a week. Take study hall instead."
morton,"We are sorry about this, Cassie."
carrie, That's not my name!
collins, That reminds me. A light blew out while I was trying to calm her down.
morton,I'll send a janitor to fix it.
bobby,"Hey, fart-face! Hey, old praying Carrie!"
bobby,"Fart-face, fart-face, fart-face..."
bobby, Fart-face!
bobby's voice,"Fart-face, fart-face, fart-face!"
eleanor,"Oh, Mrs. White."
margaret,"How have you been, Mrs. Snell?"
eleanor,Fine.
margaret,And the doctor?
eleanor,Fine.
margaret,And your daughter? 24
eleanor,Sue is... fine.
eleanor,"Won't you come in, Mrs. White?"
margaret,Thank you.
eleanor,I think Carrie is in some of Sue's classes.
margaret,Yes.
eleanor,Perhaps some time Carrie might visit...
margaret,I'm here on the Lord's work.
eleanor,"Yes, of course."
margaret,These will interest the doctor and you.
eleanor,I'm sure they will.
margaret,And your daughter.
eleanor," Well, I don't think Sue would be 25"
margaret," Children are godless these days, Mrs. Snell."
eleanor,My Sue is a good girl.
margaret,These are Godless times.
eleanor,I'll drink to that!
eleanor, We'll all read... these.
eleanor,Excuse me.  Please sit down.
eleanor,"Hello... Betty, can I call you back? Margaret White is here... Right... right... Let me get rid of her and I'll call you back."
eleanor,We'd like to contribute ten...  ...twenty dollars.
margaret,Thank you. I'll give you a receipt.
eleanor,"Thank you, Mrs. White."
margaret,I'll pray you find Jesus before it's too late.
sue,That's Carrie White's mother...
sue, What did she want?
eleanor, ...and I gave her a donation.
eleanor," Well, how was school today? 27"
sue,Today? Like always.
margaret's voice,I know you're listening. Come downstairs.
carrie,"Hello, Momma."
carrie,Who was it that called?  What did they say?
margaret, You're a woman now.
carrie,"Oh Momma, why didn't you tell me something? I was so scared..."
margaret,"`And God made Eve from the rib of Adam. And Eve was weak and loosed the raven on the world, and the raven was called Sin  `"
margaret,...and the raven was called sin...
carrie,"Why didn't you tell me? Oh, Momma"
margaret, ...and the raven was called Sin! ...and the first sin was intercourse. 30
carrie,"I was so scared! And the other girls, they made fun of me and threw things and"
carrie,"Momma, please listen. It wasn't my fault."
carrie,Momma!
margaret,"And Eve was weak and... say it, woman!"
carrie,"Momma, please help me."
margaret,And Eve was weak and loosed the raven on the world.
carrie,They threw things...
margaret, ...and the raven was called Sin... Sin! ...and the first sin was intercourse.
carrie,"Momma, please listen."
margaret,"And the Lord visited Eve with a curse, and the curse was the Curse of Blood! 31"
carrie,You should have told me!
margaret," O Lord, help this sinning woman see the sin of her days and ways. Show her that if she had remained sinless"
carrie,No!
margaret,-- the Curse of Blood would never have come on her. She may have been tempted by the Antichrist. She may have committed the Sin of Lustful Thoughts.
carrie,"No, Momma."
margaret,"Don't you lie to me, Carietta, don't you know by now I can see inside you? I can see your sin just as surely as God can."
carrie,"Momma, let me go."
margaret,"We will pray. We will pray, woman, we will pray to Jesus for our woman-weak, wicked, sinning souls..."
margaret,"And the Lord visited Eve with a Curse, and the Curse was the Curse of Blood. And there was a Second Curse, and this was the Curse of Childbearing, and Eve brought forth Cain in sweat and blood!"
carrie,Please!
tommy,Hey.
tommy,"Hey, what's the matter?"
sue,Nothing.
tommy,What did I do?
sue,Nothing. It's not you. 34
tommy,"Hey, everything's all right. I love you, honey.  Did I...?"
sue, It's Carrie.
tommy,Who?
sue,Carrie. Carrie White.
tommy,Praying Carrie?
sue, Don't call her that.
tommy, That's what she said when I read that poem you wrote for me.
sue,"Tommy, please..."
tommy, Jesus!
tommy,"Hey, honey, it was a beautiful poem. I wish I could have written it.  Honey? 35"
sue,Don't call me that.
tommy,Don't call her that. Don't call me that. What the hell's the matter with you?
tommy,"Hey, are you crying?  Are you?"
tommy,"Jesus, Sue, what is it?"
sue, I told you.
tommy,Told me what?
tommy,"That thing in the shower?  Hey, it was a joke, wasn't it? I mean, everyone was doing it."
sue,I'm not everyone.
tommy,You're special.
sue,I was one of them.
tommy,So you were teasing Carrie White 36
sue,We were hurting her
tommy,"She's used to it. Jesus, you remember how she'd get down on her knees and say grace in the cafeteria... alone, for Christ's sake. And the way she dresses... Hey, Sue, she's asking for it."
sue, How would you like to be Carrie White?
tommy,How would I like to be Carrie White?
sue,"How would you like to be Carrie White? How would you like to be Carrie White instead of being Tommy Ross... big man, big jock, popular."
tommy,"What's the big deal about being popular? I mean, one day I'll wake up and find myself working at my dad's car lot and out Friday nights and Saturdays at Uncle Billy's or the Cavalier drinking beer and maybe married with a bunch of kids...  What's that got to do with Carrie White? Or anything?"
sue,I did something wrong and I feel bad about it.
tommy,"I can understand that. Hey, back in seventh grade, there was this kid..."
sue, I've got to do something about it.
tommy,Like what?
sue,I don't know yet. Apologize.
tommy,"Okay, you tell her you're sorry. 37"
sue,That's not enough. That's like something my mom would do.
tommy,"What are you going to do? Kiss her, for God's sake?"
sue,"God, I hate you sometimes!"
tommy,What the hell do you want me to do?
sue,I want you to help me. Or are you just interested in fucking me?
tommy, Don't say that!
sue,"Fucking me, fucking me..."
tommy,Cut it out!
sue,Then help me!
tommy,"Okay, what can I do?"
sue,I want you to think about Carrie White. 38
tommy, What's there to think about?
sue,Think about it.
tommy,Jesus.
tommy,"I never thought about her. I mean, she wasn't someone you had to think about.  You know what I mean?"
tommy, Carrie White?

margaret,Go to bed.
carrie,"Good night, Momma."
margaret,Carrie! Carrie? Carrie!
margaret,"Carrie! Carrie, open this door!  Carrie!"
carrie's voice," It's open, Momma."
margaret,What was that noise?
carrie,41
margaret,Go to bed.
collins,...Snell...
sue,Here.
watson,Present. 42
collins,...and the Wilsons.
cora,Here...
rhonda,...Miss Collins.
collins, Okay. Sit down.
collins,"You too, Chris. And spit out that gum."
chris," Where'll I put it, Miss Collins?"
collins,You can choke on it for all I care. Now sit down.
collins,Okay. I just want you all to know that you did a shitty thing yesterday. A really shitty thing.
collins,"Did any of you stop to think that Carrie White has feelings? Do any of you ever stop to think? No, I guess you've got your minds on your dates and the Prom. Chris, I imagine you can take your pick, who's the lucky guy?"
chris, Billy Nolan.
collins, Who? Speak up! I can't hear you.
chris,Billy Nolan
collins,"Well, isn't he the lucky one."
collins,"And what about you, Sue? Who's taking you?"
sue,Tommy Ross. 44
collins,Right  Okay. Now my idea for this little trick you pulled was three days' suspension and refusal of your prom tickets.
collins,"That would hit you where you live, now, wouldn't it? And you'd deserve it  I don't think any of you have any idea of just how nasty what you did was. The office has decided that you're to have one week's detention."
collins,But. There's one little catch. It's to be my detention. Right here in the gym. Fifty minutes every day. Get the picture?
chris,I won't come.
collins,"That's up to you, Chris. That's up to all of you. Punishment for skipping detention is three days' suspension and the loss of your prom tickets. Any other thoughts?"
collins,Right. Now change up.
cut to:,46
chris,She can't get away with this. I'm going to get her. That goddamn snerd
sue,"Let it go, Chris. 47"
collins,"The period's not up, Hargensen."
chris,It is for me.
collins,There are ten minutes left.
chris,Stick them up your ass.
chris,"You can't hit us! You'll get canned for this, you bitch! My father"
collins,One more word from you and I'll throw you across the room. Want to see if I'm telling the truth?
chris,"She can't get away with this! Goddammit! If we all stick together, we can"
chris,Norma... Helen... Sue! 48
sue," Shut up, Chris. Just shut up."
chris,This isn't over. This isn't over by a long shot.
chris,"Hey, Sue! Just who I've been looking for!"
chris," I wanted you to sign my yearbook. Hey, where's you old man, did he stand you up?"
sue, Still at practice 49
chris,"Well, I guess you've heard I'm out of the prom. I bet that cocksucker Morton loses his job, though. Daddy's suing them. Hey, Billee! Billee! Come over and say hi to Sue."
chris," Hey, is that it? Just Sue Snell?"
billy,"Hey, Suze."
chris,"I think we're going anyway, right, Billee?"
billy,"Sure thing, Charlie."
sue,You mean crash?
chris,"Sure, why not? Hey, listen, I've got a good one. ""Roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet, but Carrie White eats shit."""
sue,"Chris, I've got to go."
chris," That goddamn Carrie! If only the rest of you had walked out with me... Jesus, Sue, why didn't you? 50"
sue,I took the detention because I thought we  I  earned it. It was a shitty thing to have done. End of statement.
chris,Bullshit! That goddamn snerd and her batshit mother  saying we're all going to hell.
sue," What'd she ever do to you, Chris? Or to any of us? Why do you hate her so much?"
chris,"Hey, hey... tell me if I'm wrong, but who was that n there pitching with the rest of us?"
sue,Me.  Me. But I stopped.
chris," You stopped. Hey, Billee, she stopped."
chris," God, I'm dumb sometimes. Billee, hey, Billee, do you want to know why Suze here didn't walk out?"
sue,"I'll see you around, Chris."
chris,"No. Wait. You stopped, remember? So just stop again.  Why didn't you walk out? Why didn't you walk out, Sue?"
sue,"Okay, Chris. That's enough."
chris,"You didn't walk out, Sue... little Suze... little Suzy Creamcheese... because you didn't want to miss a moment of your precious prom."
sue,And you don't?
chris," I'll bet you've got your dress all picked out, too. What color is it? Yellowguts?"
chris," See you around, Sue."
tommy,Hi!
sue,I want to talk to you.
tommy,"Sure, what's up?"
sue,If I asked you to do something for me  something special  would you?
tommy, Uh-huh.
sue,No matter how crazy it sounded?
tommy,Sure. What?
tommy, Are you out of your mind? 53
chris,"Goddamnit, Billy!"
chris," Slow down, you stupid shit!"
billy,"Scared, Chuckie?"
chris,"No. You'll kill us, you stupid shit!"
billy,Don't call me that.
chris,Stupid shit.
chris, Stupid shit.
billy, Oh wow!
billy,What's wrong?
chris,Can't you wait a minute?
billy,What for?
chris,You're so ignorant.
billy,That's what you like. 55
chris,Bullshit.
billy,"No? I'll show you what you like, Chuckie."
chris,No.
billy,Jesus.
chris,No!
billy,...How you... gonna... explain that...
chris,Dumb shit!
billy,What'd I tell you?
billy, Hell is this?
chris,I want you to do something. 56
chris,I want you to do something for me. Something important.
billy, Something important?
chris,It will be very important to me. It will make me feel very good if you do it.
chris," Billy, I hate Carrie White."
tommy,Okay. I'll do it.
dissolve to:,57
margaret," Carrie, did you pray?"
tommy's voice,Carrie?
carrie,Ohuh?
tommy,How're you doing?
carrie, Okay. 58
tommy,I thought you had gym this period.
tommy, What're you reading?
carrie, It's about... um.. sewing...
tommy,"Umm... if you don't have a date for the Prom, would you want to go with me?"
carrie,What?
tommy,The Prom...
tommy," ...It's next Friday, and I know this is later notice, but they stop selling tickets soon, and"
carrie,I don't like to be tricked.
tommy,Carrie... 59
george,"Hey, Ross!"
tommy,"Hey, Carrie! Wait!"
tommy," Hey, it's no big deal."
carrie,Do you people think you can just go on tricking me forever?
tommy,Sorry.
dissolve to:,60
collins,Carrie?  Was it one of the girls? Did one of the girls do something to you? Do you want a Kleenex?
carrie,No.
collins,"It's all right. Just tell me, there's nothing to be afraid of."
carrie,Miss Collins...
collins,That's it...
carrie,When can I come back to gym?
collins,"Not until Monday. Now what is it? Are you going to tell me? Come on, Carrie, tell me."
carrie,I got asked to the prom.
collins,That's great!
carrie,Tommy Ross asked me.
collins,Tommy Ross  that's wonderful. He's cute. 61
carrie,I know who he goes around with. They're trying to trick me again. I know.
collins,"Maybe he really meant it. I mean, maybe he really did mean it. Maybe you should think about it. It might be really fun. You might have a really good time!"
carrie,It would be a nightmare.
collins,"C'mon, Carrie. You should have a better image of yourself. You just think you're unattractive, but look at your hair. It's really beautiful. If you just fixed it up a little... here, I'll show you."
collins,Carrie's been asked to the prom.
morton,Who?
collins,Carrie White.
morton,By whom? The Beak?
collins,By Tommy Ross.
morton,What about his girlfriend? Doesn't he date the little Snell girl? 62
collins,I think she put him up to it.
collins,Who's brainstorm was this?  What are you trying to do?
sue,You've got it wrong.
collins,"I hope so. I wouldn't have expected this from you, Sue. Not any of it. Well?"
sue,What do you want to know?
collins,Why Tommy asked her to the prom.  Well?
sue, I asked him to.
collins,Why?
sue, I asked him to.
collins,"But, in God's name, what for? What could you possibly have in mind?"
sue,You mean what good would it do? Maybe it'll... bring her out of... make her a...
collins,"A part of things? Oh, come on, Sue. None of us are that stupid. And neither is Carrie."
sue,Maybe not.
collins,And you're not going to go? You're going to stay home and miss your senior prom?
collins," Yes, Norma? What is it?"
norma,"Just the attendance sheets, Miss Collins."
collins,"Just leave them on the desk.  You understand, you can't come without a date?"
collins," Is there something else, Norma?"
norma," No, Miss Collins."
collins, Which brings us to you.
tommy,"Miss Collins, I have to get to practice."
collins,That's too bad.
tommy,"Look, this is between Sue and me. If you don't mind..."
collins,"Oh, but I do. Or would you rather we continue this discussion in Mr. Morton's office?"
tommy, What's the big deal?
collins,Because it's a very big deal for Carrie White. And you know it.
tommy,"Anyway, she's already said no."
sue,You can make her change her mind.
tommy,Don't overrate me.
collins,Just don't try.
tommy,Okay.
sue,It's not okay.  You can't order anyone not to take someone to the prom.
collins,65
sue,We're not trying to hurt her. We're trying to help her.
collins,How?
collins," Tommy, when you come to the prom with Carrie White, don't you think you'll look a little ridiculous?"
tommy,Well...
sue,We don't care how we look.
sue, Do we?
tommy,So this is where you live.
carrie,What... what're you doing here? 66
tommy, Aren't you going to ask me in?
tommy, Why not?
carrie,Momma's resting. What do you want?
tommy,"Right to the point, huh? Okay, about the prom."
carrie,I already told you.
tommy, Nothing to stop you changing your mind. Girls do it all the time.
carrie,Why are you doing this?
tommy,"Hey, I'm asking you because I want to."
carrie,No.
tommy,"Look, I don't do anything I don't want to."
carrie,I can't.
tommy,Sure you can.
carrie,You better go.
margaret's voice,Carrie! Who are you talking to?
tommy,Don't you think you better answer?
carrie,"No one, Momma."
tommy,You're going with me.
carrie,I can't.
tommy,You're going.
carrie,They'll laugh.
tommy,No one will laugh. We'll see to it.
carrie,Please. Please go.
tommy,Not `til you say yes.
carrie,Why? Why is it so important to you?
tommy,I don't know. Maybe it's because you liked my poem. 68
carrie,Yes.  Okay.
tommy,I'll pick you up at eight.
carrie, Thank you.
margaret's voice,Carrie? Did you hear me?
carrie,"Coming, Momma. Coming."
sue,Why not?
helen,"Why did you do it? God, everyone's talking. 69"
sue,I asked Tommy to take Carrie. I thought I owed her that much.
helen,Where does that put the rest of us?
sue,You have to make up your own mind.
helen,And Tommy went along with it?
sue,Uh-huh.  I guess the other kids think I'm stuck-up.
helen,Well... they're all talking about it. But most of them still think you're okay.
helen,There is...  ...a small dissenting faction.
sue,I guess she's having a field day with this.
helen,"Susie, she hates your guts."
margaret,"You haven't touched your pie, Carrie."
carrie,"It makes me have pimples, Momma."
margaret,Your pimples are the Lord's way of chastising you.
carrie,Momma?
margaret,Yes?
carrie,"Momma, please see that I have to start to get... to try and get along with people."
margaret,Whatever are you going on about? Have you been showering with the other girls again?
carrie,I... I've been invited to the prom.
margaret, Prom?
carrie,"It's next Friday, and 71"
margaret,"It's that teacher, the one that called. She'll be sorry."
carrie,"Momma, please see that I'm not like you. I'm funny, I mean, the kids think I'm funny. I don't want to be. I want to try and be a whole person before it's too late to"
carrie," His name is Tommy Ross, and he's a very nice boy. He's"
margaret,No!
carrie,"-- promised to stop in and meet you before, and"
margaret, -- I said no!
carrie,-- have me in by midnight. I've
margaret," No, no, no"
carrie,-- accepted.
carrie," I've accepted, Momma. I have accepted. 72"
margaret,The closet.
carrie,No.
margaret,After all you've been taught
carrie,"Everyone isn't bad, Momma, everything isn't sinful."
margaret,Go to your closet and pray. Ask to be forgiven!
carrie,"You'll like this boy, he...."
margaret,"Boys. Yes, boys come next. After the blood, the boys come. Like sniffing dogs..."
carrie,Momma
margaret,"...grinning and slobbering, trying to find out where the smell comes from, where the smell is. That... smell!"
carrie,Please stop...
margaret,"Yes, in cars. Yes. I know where they take you in their cars. Roadhouses. Music. Whiskey. I've seen it, all right. Oh, yes."
carrie,"Momma, you better stop."
margaret,You're not going. 73
carrie,"I've already said I would, Momma."
margaret,Then say no. Say no. Or we'll move.
carrie,No.
margaret,We'll move from here and you'll never see that boy again.
margaret, The rain's coming in.
carrie,"Momma, sit down."
margaret,I'm going to close the windows.
carrie,I'll get them. Please sit and talk to me.
margaret,No.
carrie,"I'm going, Momma. And things are going to change around here."
margaret,Witch!
margaret," It's Satan's power. First he entered your father, carried him off..."
carrie,"He ran away, Momma. Everyone knows that."
margaret,The devil tempted him.
carrie,"He ran away with a woman, Momma."
margaret,"All men are the same. That boy, he's like all the rest, he doesn't"
carrie,"I don't care. He asked me to go. And I'm going. I'm going, Momma. You can't stop me."
de lois,Hell of a risk for a joke.
billy,You want out?
de lois," It's a good joke, Billy."
de lois," Hey, piggie..."
de lois, You sure Old Man Henty won't be around? 76

de lois,Whose funeral did he go to?

de lois,"His mother's? Jesus Christ, she musta been older than God!"
de lois, The bastard is going to shit where he stands when he comes back and gets a look.

carrie,It's very... nice.
collins, Just nice?
