Speaker,Dialogue
klute,Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
ross,"Are you with plant security, Sergeant?"
klute, Town Police.
ross,Then how are you involved?
klute, I know Tom Grunemann.
ross, You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
klute,We grew up together. Kids.
ross,Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
klute,No.
ross,Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
klute,No.
ross,Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
klute,"Everybody's got some, I guess."
ross,Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
klute,No.
ross,"Examine this letter please.  We recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. We've already contacted the New York Police; they think they know the girl in question."
holly,"My husband was not like that! My God, Klute."
klute,It looks like he sent her quite a few of those Holly -- the girl -- she recalls six or seven letters like --
holly, Johnnie I don't understand. I just don't understand.
ross,"-- has disclosed no evidence of crime or criminal intent within the jurisdiction of this bureau, and since subject Thom --"
cable, It's been almost a year! Tom Grunemann's been missing for a year. And all the FBI has to offer is a report that must bore even you.
ross, Well sir.
streiger,Are you closing the case?
ross,"No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --"
cable,But you don't find it worth much effort.
ross," Well Mr. Cable, you've got me here from the Bureau. You got Lieutenant Trask here from New York representing his department and I don't frankly consider --"
streiger, Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
ross, Trask --
trask," Four interrogations. She thought she remembered Grunemann -- from those letters from before, she made that connection -- but she hadn't seen him since and couldn't identify his photograph and she --"
streiger,Why not?
trask,"Oh a good call girl, she'll turn six-seven hundred tricks a year. The faces get blurred.  And since then, recent months, she's reported several, you know, incidents: like breather calls, anonymous phone calls, also somebody maybe following her, watching her, things like that. So it's I guess you could say, conceivable Grunemann's still around there, just hangin around her, spooking her. But you know, that --"
ross,The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.
streiger,"Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves."
ross,"Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --"
streiger,Klute offered us his services; we've accepted.
ross," Yes sir, we know he --"
streiger,"We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --"
ross," Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --"
trask, Ever done any missing person's work?
ross,"Spent much time in the city?  You see, I have to wonder -- speaking frankly; the Sergeant knows I'm only speaking frankly -"
cable,You wonder why we thought of Klute? Frankly? He's interested.
bree,Strangle him to death funny?
director,Well we go from this into stomach diagrams. It can't be too -- look let's try it again from -
bree,"Bree Daniel, any messages?  OK, thanks."
bree,Hullo.
bree,"Lover, that's got to be a little extra. I mean it sounds very exciting, what you speak of, you've got me all excited. But something special like that, you know it's got to cost a little more, mm?"
bree,"Oh lover, oh it's too much -- oh you thrill me -- yes, like that, it's -- oh it's beautiful, oh --"
bree, What is it?
bree,What about?
klute,My name's John Klute.
bree,You said that.
klute,I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
bree,Who?
klute,Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
bree, Gee.
klute,He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
bree,Why?
klute,You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
bree,Honest?
klute,Will you let me ask you some questions?
bree, Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
klute,Mm.
bree,And you just want to ask me a few questions?
klute,Mm.
bree,-- and I take acting classes with Lee Tainter --
agent,"-- Lee, yes --"
bree,"-- and I was in two of his workshop type productions, Uncle Vanya and the girl in Five Characters --  -- here -- and then of course I have the modeling and the demonstrator work, the trade-fair work -- but naturally I feel ready for something more, well you know, sustain --"
agent,"Well, thanks very much for coming in."
bree, Thank you very much.
klute,That's a lot of people to die unknown.
trask,"Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday."
bree voice,"Bree Daniel.  Yeah, hi hon."
bree,"Oh hon, I just don't know. I'm trying to stay out of it."
girl's voice,"-- comes in with these other yulds maybe two or three times a year, and five big ones baby, just one evening."
bree voice,"Marta, thanks, and I'd love to party with you hon, but --"
bree,"Well try to get someone else Marty and if I change my mind -- sure hon, bye."
bree voice,Bree Daniel --
man's voice,"Oh God baby, oh God I really love you."
bree voice,That's nice; who is this?
man's voice,"I really love you baby, you know that?"
bree voice,Bree Daniel.
bree voice,"Oh yeah, hi Frank, sure."
bree voice,"Well Frank that's awful nice but I'm out of action, sort of, you know --"
spangler,"-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Why do you want to know all this?"
klute,I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
spangler,Not unusual.
klute,Did she talk about him to you?
spangler,"About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either."
klute,Has she talked with you since prison?
spangler,"No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career."
klute,I think she's trying that.
spangler,"Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life.  But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction."
man, We had a bet on - if you were real or not. I won.
bree, Marta --
bree,Hi. Bree.  I really want to just talk to you.
bree,Hi? -_
bree,Oh thank you.
bree, It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
bree,Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
bree,"And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --"
bree,And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
bree,"Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you."
bree,"And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling --"
bree,"And next day at the beach -- our beach pavilion -- I saw him again, his eyes burning into me. I was helpless. Without his even speaking to me, without his even touching, I knew that somehow -- somehow --"
bree,Whyn't you just cut out?
bree,Oh you bastard.
klute,"No, I'm look --"
bree, If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
klute, Could I ask some questions?
bree,Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
bree,"Look, I told the police everything: I don't even remember the schlub!"
bree,"They showed me that one. I understand it's Grunemann, but I told them, I just don't remember."
bree, A family sort of man.
klute,Company outing or picnic or something like that.
bree,Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
klute,-- Tuscarora --
bree,"All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago."
klute,What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
bree,"Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --"
klute,But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
bree,I can't say he was anybody!
klute,What about everything since?
bree,"Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --"
klute,What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
bree," I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --"
klute,Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
bree,Most of them.
klute,Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
bree,How would I remember?
klute,How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
bree," You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money."
klute,I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
bree," Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that."
klute,"What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?"
bree,"You saw that, goddamn you? You saw it? He's seventy. His wife's dead. He started cutting garments at fourteen. His whole life, he's maybe had a week's vacation, I'm all he has and he never, never touches me, and what harm in it, what --"
klute, -- OK --
bree,"-- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --"
klute,OK.
bree,Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
klute,Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
bree," Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up."
klute,When?  When did you and Ligourin break up?
bree,What? This?
klute,-- OK?
bree," I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild."
klute,No thanks.
bree,"Gee. I've had men pay two hundred dollars for me -- here, you're turning down a freebie.  You can get a perfectly good dishwasher for that."
klute, I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
bree, I go on rounds.
klute,"Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking."
bree,"You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around."
klute,I couldn't get him.
bree,Well do you think it was him?
klute,What do you think?
bree,Can't you get him?
klute,"Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't."
bree, You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
klute,Do you know where he got the dumper?
bree,He never told me.
klute,"Well, let's go down and ask him."
bree,"What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each."
klute,Is that what you gave him?
frank,"Bree -- hi -- come in, come in."
bree,Frank -- Klute.
frank, I used to be a photographer myself - Bree tell you? -- Before I got in the publishing.
bree,"Frank, he knows you're a pimp. He knows you were my pimp."
frank,"Well Bree, maybe you'd rather --"
frank,How's it been?
bree,"Yeah Frank, I know that."
frank,I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.
klute,I've just got a few --
frank,I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
klute,I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
frank,Two years ago? Sorry.
klute,They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
frank,Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
klute,She told me.
frank,"OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards."
klute,"Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?"
frank," Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote."
klute,I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
frank, Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
bree,Did you like my friend Frankie?
klute,No.
bree,Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
klute,It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
bree,"About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?"
klute,It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
bree, Well -- she's dead.
klute, You said you wanted these.
bree,"Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?"
klute,You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
bree, Is there anything more I could --
klute,"I don't see anything, do you?"
bree,What're you gonna do next?
klute,Try some other ways. 
bree,What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
klute,And I don't think that was Tom.
bree,You said it was!
klute,"No, I said what did you think."
bree,"Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick."
klute,Well --
bree," Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?"
klute,"Yeah, you got to me."
bree,"-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?"
klute,Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
bree,Goodbye.
bree,"What the hell do you mean, pathetic?"
klute,It's kind of late.
bree,It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
klute,"Not much point to this, is there?"
bree," Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?"
klute,Mm.
bree,"So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby --"
klute,Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
bree,Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
quick,DISSOLVE --
bree,"I knew it, I knew it, a killer."
bree,"Oh lover -- oh you thrill me -- oh, it's beautiful -- oh yes, yes -- oh like that, like that, yes --"
klute,Thanks.
bree,"Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John."
bree,-- Why?
jang, Thank you very much.
bree,-- gug -- gug --
jang," No, that was very good everybody. Do we have all your resumes?"
producer, Booth -- Osman -- Zuff -- Anjeris Chaka.
klute,You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
bree,When?
klute,"I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you."
bree,Arlyn Page.
klute,Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
bree,Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
klute,Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
bree,Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
klute,You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
bree,"I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?"
klute,Don't worry.
bree,"Joanie -- Mike, hi --  Hi Pat."
pat," Hey Bree honey, who you got?"
bree,A new daddy. I'n he cute?
trina,"Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?"
bree,Uh uh.
trina,"Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --"
bree," Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page."
trina,Why? She's a junkie.
bree, She was with you after she left Frank.
trina,"Well she's not now.  I did everything for Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet apartment on First. But she wouldn't stay off it -- the junk -- and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things, my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We could've had everything together, everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink!"
first girl,Arlyn Page?
second girl,You'll never catch up; she's grooved out.
bree,Gil?
klute,I'm not looking for her personally - someone she might know about.
pimp, Try Janie Dale.
janie dale," It's old Mr. Clean from Cleveland. He wants to know when he can fly in and clean up the apartment and see you. I told him I have all the cleaning equipment and that he can come anytime, but it's up to you."
girl,You know he wants us to be dominant.
janie dale,"Tell him that he'd better have his ass in here by one o'clock on Monday afternoon or you won't let him clean the bathroom floor, and tell him the price has gone up twenty bucks -- Old Dutcn Cleanser's not as cheap as it used to be."
klute,Do you know where she went?
janie dale,Try Momma Reese.
momma reese,Try Bill Azure. If you can find him.
azure,"-- a couple weeks then she'd drift off a couple of weeks, you know what I mean?"
klute,Have you heard from her recently?
azure,"She liked me all right but she had what she liked better, you know what I mean?"
klute,Have you heard from her recently?
proprietress,"-- She'd come in and I'd let her have something. Why not; she'd been a good customer, a beautiful person, a beautiful beautiful person."
klute,Do you know where she went from here?
klute, Was she living with a man?
klute,What's the matter?
bree, I could wait for you someplace.
klute,If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
bree, -- Then you don't need me.
klute,But if it's someone else I do.
bree,You sure pull a lot of mileage out of a hundred dollars.
bree,"Arlyn? Honey?  Look, it's all right."
bree,"Arlyn, it's all right."
berger,"Cappy, I got a radio!"
arlyn,No --
bree,"Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about."
arlyn,"Can't you see I'm strung out?  Please, we're waiting for it -- he's got to have it!"
klute,"We'll go. Just something you could tell us, first."
bree,"Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper --"
arlyn,"Please, if he sees you, he won't come!"
bree,"Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?"
arlyn,What about him? Yes.
bree,Did he come around often?
arlyn,No. He was an older man hon. The dumper was older.
klute,Do you remember his name? What can you tell me about him?
arlyn,"Please, I am begging you."
klute,It's important.
arlyn,"That's not the Dumper, that's all! He was an older man!"
klute,Can you give me any more description than that?
arlyn,Cappy? --
arlyn,Oh baby -- no it's all right -- oh my baby baby baby --
cable,She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
klute,"I believed her, Pete."
trask,"He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything."
klute,I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
cable,"All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?"
klute, It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
cable,"Then, close the case."
klute,I better keep looking.
cable,"Where, how?"
klute, I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
cable,"You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom."
klute,It's got to make sense some way.
secretary,Mr. Cable -- they are meeting in Mr. Camara's office.
cable,"Yes Evvie, thanks. Gentlemen, I'm sorry."
klute,How is it back there?
cable,"I think you're homesick.  John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you."
trask, They were bringing a freighter down through Kill Van Kull; propellers washed it up on top.
sugarman,Why didn't you bring it up on deck?
deckhand,Would you bring it up on deck?
spence, They'll drop off theirselves when she comes out.
trask,It'll go to the Examiner. But I don't see nothin that means nothin.
sugarman,You help us with ID? We can't get nothin from him.
klute,"Arlyn Page was probably an alias. She went by the names Terry Arlyn and June Price. She may have been from Pittsburgh, someone told me. I can give you a list of people who knew her, if that would help to --"
sugarman,"No point, thanks."
klute,Is he claiming the body?
sugarman,"Uh uh, that'd mean funeral expenses."
berger,Man could you help me?
klute,"Yeah, what?"
berger,"You know, help me out. That's my baby there, dead. I got to get up."
klute,-- You've got to get up.
berger,Yeah.
trask,"That's how the other one died, you know. In the water."
klute, I looked it up.
trask,Well?
klute,Yeah.
bree,Well hello -- come on in.
klute,"I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead."
bree,How?
klute,The same as Jane McKenna.
bree," Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?"
klute,The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
bree, Why?
klute,Just let me know when you are going out and where --
bree,What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
klute,How can you do it to yourself?
bree, I don't get you.
klute,Ligourin: How could you do it?
bree,"I told you before, you wouldn't understand."
klute,"You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women."
bree,No.
klute,"No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?"
bree,Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
klute,"No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --"
bree," You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!"
bree,"If I asked you something, would you not laugh? -- asked you to look at something?"
klute,It's been a full day.
bree,Please.
klute,We did this before.
bree,No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
klute, I don't like getting splashed.
bree,OK ----- OK
klute,--- Bree ---
klute,Go back to sleep.
bree,"I'm still scared.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?"
klute,My bed.
bree,Oh!
klute,Mm.
bree,"No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I --"
klute,Yup.
bree,Oh --
bree,The son of a bitch seduced me!
spangler, I'd just be guessing.
bree,Guess!
spangler,"Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --"
bree, I do not love him.
spangler, You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
custodian,Four -- five -- what number'd I say?
klute,"Four ninety-seven, Jane McKenna"
custodian,"-- And I keep the authorization, please."
klute,I thought there'd be more.
trask's voice," All right, there's Tom Grunemann, you're right, different margins, different spacing absolutely, sloppy, right."
klute's voice,Mm.
trask's voice,"All right, try this next guy."
trask,Think this is our guy?
klute,I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
trask,Thought it might. It's off an arrest report you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.
trask's voice,"Same margins top and sides. He does best with his middle fingers; you get fainter registration from outside keys like Q, A, L, P and like that. Next thing look around apostrophes, how he hits the space bar before --"
klute,But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
trask,Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
klute,I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
trask,What else do you know?
klute,I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
trask,"We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body."
klute,I don't believe Tom's alive.
klute,"Yes, Mr. Cable's office, please."
cable's voice," John, how are you?"
klute,I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
cable's voice,It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
klute,It's not so bad.
cable's voice, What's in it?
klute,I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around.
cable voice,How do you go from that to the idea Tom's dead? Suicide you're suggesting? He killed himself?
klute, He could've been murdered.
cable's voice,I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
klute,"No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --"
cable's voice,Have you discussed this with them?
klute,It's in the report.
cable's voice,Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
klute,I wanted to give it to you first.
cable's voice,"All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?"
klute,All right.
cable's voice,"Thank you. Goodbye, John."
klute,"Goodbye, Pete."
bree,"I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?"
klute, Yeah.
bree,Is that all you have to say?
klute,What am I supposed to say?
bree,"Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more.  I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore."
klute,"Well, here's your gold star."
bree,Spangler says we have a relationship.
klute,What?
bree,You and I -- a relationship.
klute,I was wondering what that was.
bree, Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life.
bree,Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
klute,Don't touch anything.
bree,You suppose he's a married fella?
bree,He got in my clothing!
klute,Drop it.
bree," My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start."
klute,Bree --
bree,"Right back at the start, right?"
klute,Go down in my room.
bree,"You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?"
klute,Go down in my room and wait.
ross, But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
klute,Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
ross,"What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?"
trask,"Cable's letters, Cable's phone calls. Cable's everything else. He's been a Dumper a long time. He just passed off his own peculiar habits on the other man -- it kept things goin'."
ross,"OK, pretend I believe you. Tell me how you get an indictment."
trask,"Can't. Yet. Oh we got everythin' else: first rate evidence Cable typed those dumper letters to Bree Daniel. And Jane McKenna: Klute found a couple in her personal remains. We got dates of Cable's trips here coincidin' with phone calls to Bree Daniel, also the dates of death of McKenna and Page. We got some hints of his personal history. His father, unsuccessful salesman, committed suicide when he was 13. His mother pinned all her hopes on her son. He won a national science youth award at the age of eight. They had no money, but she hired special tutors for him in the summer time. She saw a good thing. He graduated from high school at 14 -- college at 16 -- no friends -- The kids in his class thought of him as a freak. He got his Ph.D. at 18 -- married at age 21 to his then employer's daughter. The marriage lasted 4 weeks. Her father had it annulled. She says he was impotent. World War II he got in bad trouble about a German girl, no details. We think we know why he killed Grunemann -- he found out Cable was a dumper; Cable couldn't take that. We think we know why he killed McKenna -- she wanted to blackmail him for it. All fine. But we got no body, no direct witnesses, we can't go any-damn-where."
klute,That's the reason i told him we had no evidence Tom was still alive. We wanted to shake him into another phone call or another letter. It didn't work out just that way.
trask,"Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway."
klute,I left them here. I was doing some work here.
trask,It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
klute,Nobody's seen that.
trask,"If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter."
ross,Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
klute,He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
trask,He sure chalks up a lot of flight time.
bree,"Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?"
klute,"Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment."
bree, Can I go in? I need some stuff.
klute,Where'd you spend last night?
bree,With Trina.
klute,I called Trina.
bree,Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
klute,"Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad."
bree, How do you know how bad it was?
klute,Why couldn't you stay here with me?
bree,Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
klute,Trask wants to talk with you.
bree,"Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --"
klute,Trask wants to talk with you.
trask,"Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up."
bree," Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?"
trask,A few more days. We know who did this.
bree,So do I.
trask,"No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The man that killed him -- also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page."
bree, Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
trask,Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
bree,"You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that."
trask,Well we're pretty --
bree,Why isn't he locked up?
trask,"We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more."
bree,Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
trask,I guess he figured it was better.
bree,What was better? I made better bait?
trask,"No, that's not --"
bree,"Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --"
trask," From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at."
bree,I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
trask,Here please.
bree,Oh no.
trask,Like for you to look for the man.
bree,Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
trask,No. Not Grunemann. The Dumper. Just look around -- I said look for the Dumper.
bree,Oh! --
cable,Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
klute,Well there's a couple --
cable,"I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --"
klute,Well as a matter of --
cable,"I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me."
klute,Yeah.
cable,I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
klute,"Yeah, two things Pete, that --"
cable,You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
klute,Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
cable,I'm sorry. I don't understand.
klute,It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
cable,"It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --"
klute,"Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB."
cable, Some mistake perhaps that --
klute,No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
cable,You must be discouraged.
klute, Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
cable,That who?
klute,"Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew."
cable,"You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom."
klute,Someone's been doing all these things.
cable,"You were hired to look for Tom, not someone."
klute,"Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book."
cable,What?
klute,"Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time."
cable,You were hired to look for Tom.
klute,I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
cable,I can't follow you.
klute,Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
cable,No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
klute, I want a look at it anyhow.
cable,"Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed."
klute,"All right, but I'm going to see that list."
cable,Why would they deal with you? You don't know these people.
klute,"No, but Bree does. She's negotiating for me. Bree Daniel."
cable,I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
klute,"Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street."
cable,Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
klute,Just send me a money order.
cable,"No, I'd -- like to be in on it."
klute,Well --
cable,Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
klute,Bree?
klute,I'm always getting surprises.
bree, Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
frank," Look, it's not necessarily how it looks, right? It's --"
klute,No. Please. Not with this son of a bitch.
frank,"Klute, let's handle it like grownups? I mean we're all grown up now, right?  -- we all respect each other, you know what I mean? -- I respect you, Bree respects you -- you could say, it just didn't work out between you and she. But you got to respect her too -- you know, her best interests, best for her --"
bree,No!
frank,"Hey, I'm gonna get you dropped."
klute, Please --
bree,"-- until he gets back.  Yes I heard you, I understand that. I said I'm going to come over, I'll wait until he gets back."
klute,"Hello?  Trask, I don't get that."
klute,"Who told you, his secretary?  I'll look around, I'll call you back."
klute,Bree --
lela,"-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --"
bree,No.
lela,Well I have to close up now.
bree,Look -- could I use your phone?
lela,Yes indeed.
bree,Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
lela, Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
faber,Yes?  Bree?
bree, -- I'm -- I just have to talk to someone. I'm just a little way across town --
faber,"Yes - yes dear, yes -- maybe half an hour, sure, yes."
klute,"Trina, will you call me if you hear from, her? Will you check other people she might call? Yeah, if it wasn't trouble I wouldn't ask vou."
foreman,"Lady, it's closing up there."
bree,What?
foreman,"We're closing up, quitting time, Fabers."
bree, I have an appointment with Mr. Faber.
foreman,"Oh, yeah."
bree,I have an appointment with Mr. Faber.
receptionist,In there.  Mr. Faber --
nathan,Yes?
bree,I'm sorry -- Mr. Faber Senior.
nathan, My father went home about fifteen minutes ago; he wasn't feeling too good.
bree,It wasn't important.
bree,Did Mr. Faber leave a message for me or anything? Mr. Faber Senior? Bree Daniel.
receptionist,"Oh, I thought that was for tomorrow."
bree,"Bree Daniel. Has he called in yet? Well if he does, I'm at --  Just tell him Bree Daniel; he knows who."
klute,Did she leave a number?  What is the number? --
cable,"Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily?  I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? --"
bree,Yes -- all right --
cable,-- We can talk --
bree,-- Yes.
cable,"All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a -- position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you? Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book."
bree,Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
cable,"No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?"
bree,Yes.
cable,"Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?"
cable,I've got no idea what I shall do.
bree,Will you let me go then?
cable,"It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?"
bree, If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
cable," Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?"
bree,"I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes."
cable,Excuse me Miss Daniel?
bree,"I said yes, I see."
cable," Oh no, I don't think --"
bree,Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
cable,You're willing to listen? You want me just to keep talking?
cable,"You're a person of no value, you have no value --"
klute,Come on.  Come on.
bree,Hi.
klute,I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
bree,Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
klute,Mm.
bree,You're going back?
klute,Mm.
bree,What?
bree," You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?"
bree,"Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?"
bree,Oh heck --  Oh heck --
