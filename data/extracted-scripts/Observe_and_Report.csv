Speaker,Dialogue
mark,"Ladies, please, we're doing everything we can to handle the situation. Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our shoppers. Now in the meantime, feel free to check out some of our wonderful back-to- school sales. Excuse me for a minute."
mark,Have you seen Ronnie?
receptionist,I haven't seen him all morning.
mark,"Ramon, have you seen Ronnie?"
janitor,"No, senor."
mark,Where is Ronnie?
ronnie," Pull over to the sidewalk, NOW!"
stevie,"Fuck off, Ronnie, it's just a parking lot."
ronnie,"Sir, pull over to the sidewalk, NOW!"
hector,Leave us alone.
stevie,"Yeah, skating's not a crime, dick."
ronnie,Skateboarding is not allowed on mall premises. Pull over now!
stevie,We're not leaving.
hector,"Yeah, fuck you!"
ronnie,"That way I could handcuff you smoothly and take you in. You know, never mind, just get in the goddamn golf cart."
ronnie,It seems like we go through this every day. What's it going to take for you all to realize that I won't tolerate this horseplay and just do whatever you want to and don't worry about the rules attitude?
stevie,"Ronnie, I hear what you're saying and I just want you to know that personally, it pains me to see you all worked up and I just want you to know that I'm really sorry because you can't do shit and you can take your little rules and stick'em up your ass, you fuckin' rent-a-cop."
hector,"Yeah, suck my dick."
ronnie,"That's funny, guys. I try to be a mentor to the youth, but it seems like you boys have gone straight past boydom to the land of street- hardened criminals. I'm left with no choice. You call me rent-a- cop, but I call myself the law's right hand. I see the crime... and I phone it in. And that's what I'm getting ready to do right now."
ronnie," 317, this is Ronnie Barnhardt over at Carolina Mall. Come in, over."
ronnie,"While I won't have you arrested today, I am going to suspend each of you for one week. For those of you who don't know how this works, here it is. This is official documentation. If you step foot on mall property, it is considered trespassing. At that point, I call the police, they come down, you go directly to jail."
ronnie,Amen.
ronnie,"Nothing, Nell."
ronnie,"Slow it down. Watch your speed there. This ain't a race. Hey, second time, slow it down."
mark,I've been looking all over for you.
ronnie,"I haven't been hiding, but some things that I have to do are better to keep hidden from you and 'official' eyes. Trust me, it's best all around if there are no bodies to clean up."
mark,"So you may or may not have heard, but this morning, several women were assaulted just outside the front doors by a crazy Pervert."
ronnie,For the love of God.
mark,"I know, it's horrible."
ronnie,You want me to phone this one in to the police?
mark,"Not just yet. See if we call the police, they'll be a big scandal and something like that could kill what little traffic we have at this mall. What I need you to do is watch out for this Pervert and if you see him, try to stop him or quietly phone it in so we can handle this discreetly."
female reporter,"Excuse me, sir, but we would like to ask you a few questions."
ronnie,"I'm sorry, but I can't answer anything."
female reporter,We heard a report that an unidentified man was spotted earlier today exposing himself to several women. Do you care to comment?
ronnie,I'm not allowed to comment on that situation.
female reporter,So you admit there is a situation.
ronnie,"I'm trained to resist torture for up to 72 hours, you really expect me to break now? Get real, lady."
female reporter, We're wasting our time here. Let's go find some police to interview.
ronnie,Good luck.
female reporter,What's that supposed to mean?
ronnie,It just means you won't find any police.
female reporter,Are you telling me the police haven't even been called!
ronnie," Ewww, alert the media."
female reporter,"Jesus, well who'd they leave in charge, you?"
female reporter,"Yeah, right. Why would they leave you in charge?"
ronnie,"First of all, if there was a situation to be handled, I don't see why you find it so goddamn ridiculous that I would be in charge."
female reporter," Look, there is no way you're in charge of this investigation."
ronnie,"Well for your information, I'm in charge of this whole fucking operation. "
ronnie," I warned you about parking in the fire lane, Saddamn!"
ronnie, Step away now!
ronnie,"Sir, I will be forced to take action if you do not step back!"
ronnie,"As I was saying, the pervert situation here is real bleak. For all you people out there thinking of coming to the mall, please for your own safety, stay away."
saddamn, I can't believe you tased me.
ronnie, That's right and I've got another one waiting right here for you.
ronnie,"I'm here on official business. See, I don't know if you know this, but I have recently been made Head of Mall Security. Did you hear about that?"
ronnie,"Dennis, man, I'm glad we've got a minute to talk. There's no easy way to say this so I'm just going to come right out with it. Mark offered me the position of Head of Mall Security. I know this isn't easy for you to hear seeing as you've been here longer than me. But I want you to know that you're my best friend and I'm only going to accept the job if you're okay with that."
ronnie,"Hey, you want to go and grab a beer or something?"
ronnie,"Yeah, you're right. You're probably in no mood to party after that news. Well, try not to take it too hard. See you later, buddy."
mom,"You think you're ready for a shot at the title, motherfucker?!"
ronnie,"I'm ready, Mom."
mom,Ding ding.
ronnie,Ow!
mom,"What's wrong, baby?    Is your pussy hurting?"
ronnie,Fuck you!
mom,Ah!
ronnie,You give?
mom,Fuck you!
mom,Ow!
ronnie,"You move with me, you go down. You move against me and your arm breaks."
mom,I give!
ronnie,What's that?
mom,"I give!   Let me go, goddamn it."
mom,I can't believe you got that lucky shit on me.
ronnie,Luck has nothing to do with it.
mom,You almost broke my arm.
ronnie,"I'm sorry, Mom. Are you okay?"
mom,Not really.
mom," I'm so proud of you, Ronnie."
ronnie,Do you think I did good?
mom,Hell yes.   You were great.
ronnie,"Ah, you're just drunk."
mom,"Nah, you did good."
ronnie,"Yeah, I usually don't come out to the forefront like that. "
ronnie,You working the door here?
bouncer,That's what they tell me. They needed to hire a little security here in case the drunks get out of line or whatever.
ronnie,"Kind of funny they thought they needed more security here. Ha. You do realize that if anyone gets out of hand, you need to call me to handle the situation."
bouncer,"I work for O'Charley's, not for the mall."
ronnie,"Granted, but you realize that my jurisdiction supersedes any and all other forms of security when under the roof of Carolina Mall?"
bouncer,"You know, I thought about getting a job as a Mall Security."
ronnie,You did?
ronnie,"My young friend, you are sorely mistaken. Do you know how much stuff I'm in charge of?"
bouncer,What about it?
bouncer,Okay.
bouncer,Oh yeah?
mark," Alright, people, she's doing good. We're just gonna get her down to my office and everything's going to be fine, so the best thing for you employees to do is just get on back to your stations and you customers can go ahead and enjoy the back to school savings here at Carolina Mall."
bruce,"Just let it out, baby.   He should be ashamed!"
mark,"Brandi, please, Dennis has called the police and let's just take this down to my office."
bruce,A Pervert attacked Brandi is what's going on!
mark,They're on the way.
mark,"I'm trying, but she just keeps crying."
ronnie,"Brandi! I came as soon as I heard. Jesus, are you alright?"
mark,"She's fine, Ronnie."
ronnie,"This is one of the most heinous things I've seen. Jesus, I tried to tell you about the skirts. It's not your fault, you little fighter you. Ronnie's not mad, okay?"
mark,"Ronnie, can you get her down to my office so the Police can talk to her in private when they arrive."
ronnie,Rogers.
ronnie,Don't worry.   I'll carry you.
mark,"Oh, fucking Jesus."
detective harrison,"Your secretary told me to come on in. I'm Detective Harrison, Cabarrus County Police."
mark,"Mark Talbert, I manage the mall. This is Brandi, she's the one who saw the deviant."
detective harrison,"Hello, Brandi.     Are you doing okay?"
detective harrison,"Yes, ma'am, I'm sure you are after all you've been through, but I'm here to tell you that we're going to work together to make sure we catch the person who did this."
ronnie,"My name is Ronnie Barnhardt, chief inspector on the case and head of Mall Security here at Carolina Mall and this is my lieutenant, Dennis. From one law enforcement officer to another, I just want to welcome you and say that we will do whatever it takes to coordinate with your department in order to bring this assailant to justice."
detective harrison,"Great.  Okay, Brandi. Did you get a look at the suspect?"
ronnie,Did you get a blood sample?
mark,"Go ahead, Detective."
detective harrison,"Thank you. Brandi, can you remember anything specifically? What color was his hair? Was he tall or short?"
detective harrison,Was his hair long or short?
detective harrison,Did he say anything?
detective harrison,What was he wearing?
ronnie,This is what I got so far.
ronnie,What's yours look like?
detective harrison,I just wrote a description.
ronnie,Oh.
detective harrison,"Okay, Brandi, I think that's good for now. I think the best thing at this point is to just follow up with the other ladies who saw the perpetrator yesterday and see if they remember anything."
detective harrison,That's highly unlikely. These incidents are usually random and unpredictable. I'm sure you'll be safe.
ronnie,"I'm afraid I'm going to have to disagree with you there, Detective. By my math, it seems pretty clear that Brandi's been targeted."
detective harrison,Targeted? What gives you that impression?
ronnie,"Well, how about the fact that she was the first employee to get assaulted? Not to mention the fact that she is the prettiest girl who works at this mall. To me it seems obvious that this is some sort of methodical villain that plans on returning to finish what he started by murdering Brandi."
detective harrison,That's not going to happen.
detective harrison,Well don't worry. I'm on the case and I'm going to do everything in my power to bring this guy down.
ronnie,"That's right, Brandi, you've got the best team in law enforcement working for you."
detective harrison,"Look, I've got to get going. Here's my card. I'll even write my home phone number on the back, just in the event you need to get a hold of me."
detective harrison,Give me a call when you aren't working and I'll have you come to the station to look through some mug shots.  Don't worry okay.
detective harrison,What?
detective harrison,"Oh, okay."
detective harrison,Don't do that.
ronnie,Oh shit.
detective harrison,"My team just checked all the doors and there are no signs of forced entry. I've also checked out the crime scene, but we didn't see any fingerprints on the glass. The suspect was probably wearing gloves."
mark,That doesn't sound good.   How did they do it?
detective harrison,My guess it was an inside job. Probably someone who has access to keys like a janitor or a security guard.
detective harrison,Whoever did this would have to had keys to the Security Room so they could shut off the camera.
ronnie,"Look, my record speaks for itself and as for Dennis, well I can certainly vouch for him. Dennis is one of the finest men I know, so just take my word, you're barking up the wrong tree. Now, let's put this little squabble behind us and get back to busting the guys that robbed this mall."
detective harrison,"Ronnie, nobody is accusing anybody, but I would like to stick around for a while and interview some of the employees."
mark,"Okay, but all I ask is that you do it quietly, so that the hoopla is kept to a minimum."
detective harrison,I understand.
mark,"Ronnie, you are to leave Detective Harrison alone and let him handle the investigation."
ronnie,"No can do, Mark. When you appointed me Head of Mall Security, I swore an oath to protect this mall and aid in bringing crime to its knees."
ronnie,"Okay, Dennis. I've gotta hang with Detective Harrison. "
detective harrison,"So, have you seen any suspicious people hanging around the mall? Anybody who might have been casing the stores?"
saddamn,"Nah, man.   I ain't seen nothing."
detective harrison,"Okay, well if you can think of anything, here's my card."
ronnie," My turn, Rookie."
detective harrison,"What are you doing, Ronnie?"
ronnie,Solving the whole case right before your eyes.
detective harrison,"Ronnie, this is official police business."
ronnie,"Hello, Saddamn."
saddamn,"What the fuck you want, Ronnie?"
ronnie,I want your ass to face the music is what I want.
saddamn,"Don't come any further, bitch. The restraining order says 20 feet so just back the fuck up."
detective harrison,"Ronnie, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but just let me handle this.  Have a good day, sir."
ronnie,So you're just gonna let him slip right through your fingers?
detective harrison,I have no reason to make him a suspect.
ronnie,No reason? Look at him. There's every reason in the goddamn book.
saddamn,"Why are you saying that, man?"
ronnie,"I think it's obvious, Saddamn."
saddamn,"That's fucked up. You're racist, man."
ronnie,You're not even black.
detective harrison,"Ronnie, stop. We're finished here. Now if you're going to tag along, I'm gonna need you to just stay back; are we clear?"
saddamn,"What's up, girl, you got a boyfriend? Free cell phones with a month trial and I throw in my phone number for free."
detective harrison,Did you let anybody borrow your keys?
janitor,"No, senor."
detective harrison,Have you seen anything suspicious?
janitor,"No, senor."
detective harrison,"Okay, sir.   Thank you for your time."
ronnie,"Alright, I believe I can be of some assistance here."
detective harrison,"Ronnie, we talked about this."
ronnie,"Communication skills, watch and learn."
ronnie,Que pasa?
janitor,Long drawn out conversation in Spanish?
ronnie,Como?
janitor,More Spanish dialogue.
ronnie,"Si.  Yeah, this guy definitely did it."
detective harrison,What did he say?
ronnie,"I don't know, I don't speak Spanish, but judging from his tonal inflections, it's safe to say that he's hiding something. The only question is where.  Okay, Ramon, I'm giving you one chance and one chance only to come clean. Or else Detective Harrison is going to come over to your house and deport your whole family back to Mexico."
detective harrison,"No, I'm not."
ronnie,"Good cop, bad cop, just play along.  Where are you hiding the jewels?"
janitor,No se.
ronnie,"Alright, you're gonna make me be the bad guy here? Well, that's a role I'm comfortable playing. Let's just see what you're hiding."
ronnie,"Think you're pretty slick, don't you? Guess what? I'm pretty slick too."
ronnie,"Alright, you're free -- Wait a minute."
ronnie,"Okay, my mistake. Sir, you're free to go. Uh, you might want to have someone clean this up which in this case is you, so, uh, chop- chop. Wouldn't want anyone to slip on this mess."
hot clerk,"Hello, can I help you?"
detective harrison,I'm Detective Harrison with the Cabarrus County Police.
ronnie,"And I'm Ronnie Barnhardt, head of Mall Security."
detective harrison,"Okay, seriously, would you back the fuck off?! I'm trying to do my job and you're fucking it up."
ronnie,"Come on, we're working here."
detective harrison,I'm working!
detective harrison, Sorry. Hi. I'm doing a check with all the mall employees to see if anybody has any information on the robbery that took place here last night?
hot clerk,"I'm sorry, but I haven't noticed anything out of ordinary."
sexy worker,"Tracy, do you think my boyfriend would like these?"
detective harrison,"That's fine, thanks for the help."
ronnie,"You're gonna let them distract you with a little bit of panty showing.    You have got a lot to learn, my friend.  Who are you protecting, toots?"
hot clerk,What are you talking about?
ronnie,"Look, I'm sure you and your little friend have made a real lifestyle for yourselves here. It's probably easy for you to blind most men with your beauty, but I'm not most men. I can see through the sexuality to the truth. Jewelry, gold, diamonds, you don't really expect me to think that a man wants that crap. I'm putting you on my list of top suspects. I don't think you did the crime, but I do think you are an accomplice."
detective harrison,"I'm sorry, ma'am. He's not with me. Here's my card. If you think of anything, just give me a call."
ronnie,You should be ashamed of yourself.
ronnie,Is that pot I smell?
detective harrison,"Shut up, Ronnie!"
salesman,It's sage.
ronnie,"Whatever, hippy. If I find you doing drugs or killing cats or whatever you devil worshippers do, I'll come back here and bust you. I swear to God."
detective harrison,"Get the hell out, Ronnie. I'm here to ask questions about the robbery."
ronnie,"Just forget that, we're on to something bigger here.  Tell me more about this 'sage.'"
ronnie,"Now, maybe I'm crazy or maybe I'm the smartest man alive, but it seems kind of convenient to me that you sell hammers like this one that could easily be used to smash a glass case in, oh say, a jewelry store."
sears manager,Couldn't you smash the glass with anything?
ronnie,You really think you're gonna talk your way out of this one?
ronnie,"You guys should have been there today. We were just solving shit left and right. I mean, that's what this job is supposed to be like. Busting loiterers and kids who steal pennies from the fountain has its rewards, but really getting in there and closing cases is where it's at. It's rewarding too because at the end of the day, you know you've done something good for the world."
bouncer,"What are we doing here, Ronnie? I thought you said they were giving away free Chick-fil-A sandwiches."
ronnie,Well -- What is your name anyway?
bouncer,Charles.
ronnie,"Well, my young apprentice. I called you here today because as Head of Mall Security, I have decided that it's time to take protection to the next level. In other words, I alone cannot combat this recent crime wave. In order to help me in my personal journey, I have decided to divide up the tasks between my soldiers. So, for now on, Dennis, my right-hand man, you will be in charge of solving the case of who is robbing the mall. Little Chucky, you will be on the case of the Pervert. You are both to collect data and provide it to me. I will analyze the data, draw conclusions, and solve these crimes as well as coordinate and strategize with various law enforcement agencies."
ronnie,"Anyway, our new unit will operate under the name, 'Special Elite Task Force.' You will answer directly to me and no one else. Now, let's all put our hands in the middle and do a unifying cheer."
ronnie,"Okay, so now I say we all take a celebratory trip to Sears because, as we all know, today is half- price day on all automotive parts for mall employees."
ronnie,Just doing my job with a little something extra especially for you.
ronnie,"Brandi, um... I was just thinking, would you like to go to dinner this weekend?"
ronnie,"Look, it's not like that. I've got a girlfriend... who doesn't work in this mall."
ronnie,Is $20 enough?
brandi,"Nah, fifty."
ronnie,"Hey, Brandi."
brandi,What?
bodyguard,My eyes!
stevie,I'm listening.
ronnie,Come on.   Why do you have to bring that up?
slick salesman,"Can I help you, sir?"
ronnie,"Yeah, um, I've got a really special date tonight with a hot young lady -- Do you know Brandi?"
slick salesman,No.
ronnie,"Never mind. Anyway, I need something that's really 'cool.' Something that will impress her and I guess you could say I'm not exactly in the know with what the hipsters are up to these days."
slick salesman,Let's see. Are you looking to fall in love or are you looking to get laid?
ronnie,"Um, I guess love, but uh..."
slick salesman,"You want to get laid, too?"
ronnie,"Watch it, man.     She's a lady.   But yes."
slick salesman,"Alright, I got just the thing. Something classy is what you want. Show her you're a man with taste."
mom,"Come on, Ronnie, just get out here."
ronnie,It's too tight in the butt.
mom,Let me see.
mom,"Ronnie, you look so handsome! RONNIE Really, you don't think I look like a phony."
mom,Hell no.   You look like a stud muffin.
ronnie,"Yeah, I guess these clothes are kind of cool."
mom,Nell is a lucky girl.
ronnie,"She is, Mom. She's the most perfect girl in the whole world."
mom,I remember when your father picked me up for our first date. I swear he was the most handsome man that I had ever laid eyes on. I knew right then and there that this would be the man that I married.
ronnie,I hope that happens tonight.
ronnie,"Mom, why did Dad leave?"
mom,"Well, he kind of freaked out when you were born. You had so many special needs that he just couldn't handle the pressure. One day, he just couldn't take it anymore."
ronnie,Do you think it was my fault that Dad left?
mom,Definitely. You don't think it was mine do you?
ronnie,"Well, I didn't know, with the drinking and all."
mom,"Nope, it was all you."
mom,"I love you, Ronnie."
ronnie,"I love you, too, Mom."
ronnie,"Damn, that was pretty impressive."
ronnie,"Well, Brandi, can I just say that you look absolutely beautiful tonight."
ronnie,"Yeah, yeah.   No problem."
ronnie,"Oh, it's nothing."
ronnie,It's just a pill I'm supposed to take.
ronnie,The Doctor.
ronnie,"Yeah, I guess I party like this every four to six hours as needed."
ronnie,Help yourself.
brandi,Hell yeah!
ronnie,"So, how do you like working at the mall?"
ronnie,"Yeah, I see how that could get to you."
ronnie,That's a lot.
brandi,It's Friday.
ronnie,"So, Brandi, I hope I'm not being too forward, but do you have a boyfriend?"
ronnie,Yes!
ronnie,"Yeah, I understand. I hate ties. I recently cut mine and now I'm free like a bird."
ronnie,To new beginnings.
ronnie,Okay.
ronnie,No more.    I'm sticking to beer.
ronnie,"God, you remind me so much of my mother."
ronnie,You are so beautiful.
ronnie,"Brandi, this is the most fun I've ever had on a date."
ronnie,"Wooo! Um, so, Brandi, it's no secret that I'm attracted to you. I think everybody in the mall is. As you know, I recently split with my girlfriend and basically, I was wondering if, since you don't have a boyfriend, that I could maybe be your boyfriend and you could be my girlfriend?"
ronnie,"Brandi, I had a wonderful time tonight."
ronnie,Are you okay?
ronnie,"I love you, Brandi."
bruce,Okay.   Thanks.
ronnie,You have?
ronnie,What color of roses do the women like anyway?
flower salesman,"Well, it depends on what you are trying to say. The white roses symbolize innocence and purity."
ronnie,"Yeah, we're way past the color white if you know what I mean. What about the yellow ones?"
flower salesman,"Joy, happiness, appreciation."
ronnie,I don't even know what to make of that.
flower salesman,The pink rose means thank you.
ronnie,Next.
flower salesman,The red rose is the most powerful. It symbolizes love.
ronnie,Why didn't you just say that?    I'm a busy man here.
flower salesman,I'm sorry.
ronnie,Forget it. Give me a big bag of the red ones.
flower salesman,"Um, can I ask a question?"
ronnie,Go ahead.
flower salesman,Do you really like Brandi?
ronnie,"I've only been on one date with her, but I could see myself being with her for all of eternity."
flower salesman,"Well, in that case, the greatest symbol of love is just a single red rose."
ronnie,"Seems   like a big bag of roses would   be more love than just one, but I   guess you're the expert. Gimme   one."
ronnie,Brandi?
ronnie,I came here to see you. And to present you with this single red rose. It symbolizes 'love.'
ronnie,"Well, after last night,   I just wanted you to know that   it wasn't just some fling to me.    It meant something special and I   felt it deep in my soul."
bruce,You fucked the Security Guard?  You are such a little slut!
ronnie,I'm here to become a police officer.
policeman,We're always on the hunt for new recruits. Do you have at least a high school diploma?
ronnie,I have a GED.
policeman,"We usually prefer an actual diploma, but GED is technically acceptable. Are you a citizen of the United States?"
ronnie,You bet your ass I am.
policeman,"Okay, Mr. Barnhardt, there are several steps you have to complete in order to be eligible for the police academy. Physical evaluation, psychological test, background check. "
ronnie,That sounds fun. Sign me up.
detective harrison,"Well, just pay attention tonight and make sure you stay out of the way."
ronnie,"Right, we're not back at the station anymore so we can cut the charade."
detective harrison,What are you talking about?
ronnie,"Well, I know that policy demands I stay out of the way, but between you and me, I just want you to know that if anything pops off tonight, I'm going to jump right in there and take 'em down with you."
detective harrison,"No, no. Ronnie, policy says you have to stay in the car."
ronnie,I get you. You have to say this in order to keep you safe 'legally' speaking. I should probably follow along too. 'I swear I won't get out of the car and fight justice tonight.'
detective harrison,"Ronnie, you really can't."
ronnie,I know.
ronnie,"Yeah, so then I basically saw his ass trying to circumvent around the ped exit and slip through the employ exit. Not allowed. The two ped exits are to be used only --"
detective harrison,"You see that corner there, Ronnie?"
ronnie,"Yeah, I see it."
detective harrison,"That corner used to be the worst corner in this whole town. It was riddled with drugs, prostitution, and gang violence. It was nicknamed 'The Crossroads.'"
ronnie,"Shit, I've heard of that."
detective harrison,"That's right, but myself and the other officers worked on cleaning it up for years so that the good folks of this neighborhood wouldn't have to worry about being safe. Yes, sir, that corner is a testament to the fine police work of our force."
ronnie,I don't know.    It looks pretty shitty to me.
detective harrison,"Well, it's a low income area, Ronnie. You're being kind of prejudiced."
ronnie,"Oh, yeah, I can see that it's basically a fine neighborhood."
detective harrison,"That's right, but it hasn't been easy. We still patrol this area every night just to keep our presence up."
ronnie,I use that same technique at the mall.
detective harrison,"I'm sure. I usually do the foot patrols myself, but because I like you, I'm going to let you do it tonight."
ronnie,Really?
detective harrison,"Yeah,   really. But I told you about   department policy, so I'm going   to need you to keep quiet about   this one."
ronnie,You can count on me.     Thank you for the honor.
detective harrison,"Of course, Ronnie. I just really believe in you."
ronnie,I won't let you down.
ronnie,Where are you going?!
ronnie,"Hey, no horse play. You guys get on home."
kid,You want some crack?
ronnie,"No, I don't want any crack. In fact, I didn't want to do this, but you leave me no choice in the matter. I'm placing you under citizen's arrest."
kid,"Let me go, motherfucker!"
ronnie,I place you under citizen's arrest for the crime of selling a Schedule 1 Narcotic. You have the right to remain silent...
ronnie,"... If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you. Now I guess we just wait here for my ride to come back."
ronnie,"Who, this little guy right here?"
ronnie,"Well, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but it appears that your little brother has tried to sell me illegal drugs. I know it's hard for you to hear that."
ronnie,"Is that so? Well then, it looks like you got one less employee because I'm taking little brother down. I'll die right here before I let crime prevail."
ronnie," Free to go, little brother. My mistake completely. Good luck with the crack."
ronnie,"Alright, so I guess I'll be seeing you folks."
ronnie,"Oh, no. That's really not necessary, Tone."
ronnie,"Oh, Jesus, I don't want to die. Don't let me die, don't do it!"
ronnie,"No, please!   I'm sorry!"
detective harrison,"Trust me, you would have done the same thing. This guy is without a doubt the biggest fucking idiot I have ever met."
detective harrison,"Good! Fuck him, I hope he does get killed."
detective harrison,"Ronnie, what are you doing here?"
ronnie,I know what you did!
detective harrison,"Ronnie, look, I didn't do anything --"
ronnie,You're not going to talk your way out of this one. You set me up!
detective harrison,"Ronnie, look --"
ronnie,Don't try to deny it! You set me up and that's all there is to it.
detective harrison,"Ronnie, I --"
ronnie,And I just want to thank you for it.
detective harrison,Thank me?   Why?
ronnie,"Because I'm proud to report that I passed the test. I know you wanted to see if I had the chops to cut it on the police force and I'm glad to say that I passed. I knew I would get initiated some time, but I didn't think it would be so soon. Thank you, Detective Harrison. Thank you for believing in me."
detective harrison,"Ronnie, I don't know what to say."
ronnie,"You don't have to say anything. Your actions speak for themselves. Thank you for giving this rookie a shot. Get used to seeing Ronnie Barnhardt around here, boys."
ronnie,"With Charles on my team, I can now devote more time to the robbery and Pervert case. I plan on having these wrapped up by the end of the week."
psychologist,"Okay, Ronnie, today I'll be giving you a psychiatric evaluation to determine if you're competent to enter into the Police Academy. It's really just a formality. Don't want any serial killers working for us, now do we?"
ronnie,"No, ma'am, we don't."
psychologist,"Okay, Ronnie, so let's start with your background. Where are you from?"
ronnie,Born and raised right here.
psychologist,"Local boy. Okay, and, Ronnie, have you ever been convicted of any crimes?"
ronnie,"No, ma'am.   My record is totally clean."
psychologist,Do you now take any illegal drugs or have you taken any in the past?
ronnie,"No, ma'am. I believe drugs are the path to self-destruction and should be purged from the face of the earth with ruthless vengeance."
psychologist,Any prescription medications?
ronnie,"Yes, for my nerves. A man in my line of work has a lot of stress to deal with. If you've seen the bloodshed I've seen, you'd be on the meds too. I -- Where are you going with this?"
psychologist,Are you presently or have you ever been affiliated with the Communist Party?
ronnie,I can't believe you'd even ask me that.
psychologist,Have you ever been in the military?
ronnie,Yes.
psychologist,What branch of the military were you in?
ronnie,The kind of branch that doesn't exist on paper.
psychologist,"Okay, here's a real world scenario. You have a gun --"
ronnie,Finally.
ronnie,"Would I? Yes. Would I be more useful working alone, I would say definitely. I see myself more like a Rambo kind of guy. A man who rolls solo. Taking care of business on his own terms. Kind of like a Superhero or something."
psychologist,Why do you want to become a cop?
ronnie,"I want to become a cop to help people. The world is a scary place with lots of evil everywhere. See, I have this vision of evil trying to get at the world from every angle and there I stand at the top of it all with my gun, just kind of blowing it away. Just me and my weapons, cleaning up this whole town. I know I could do some good if I was just given a chance and everybody would be a lot better off."
ronnie,Ronnie Barnhardt reporting for duty.
detective harrison,"I can see that. Listen, I don't really know how to say this, but we're not going to be able to let you join the academy."
ronnie,What?!   Why not?
detective harrison,It seems you had a little trouble passing the minimum requirements.
ronnie,Did I fail one of the tests?
detective harrison,"Ronnie, I personally did your background check and this is the fifth time you've been turned down for the police academy."
ronnie,You guys keep records on that?
detective harrison,"We sure do. Look, I tried to talk to them, but there's no way they're gonna let you in. I'm sorry, but your dreams of becoming a Police Officer just aren't going to happen."
ronnie,"I understand. Thanks for believing in me, Detective. And just for the record, I'm not crazy."
ronnie,"Hey, Nell."
ronnie,"No, I'm not cool, Charles. In fact, shit is seriously fucked up. I've got to protect the whole mall by myself. Now, I got you this fucking job, when are you going to stop being a little baby and do something for a change.  'I don't want to do anything hard. I just want to be a little bitch and brag about dropping out of college.' Grow a fucking pair, will you, Chucky?"
charles,I'm gonna go check the parking lot.
ronnie," I'm sorry, Charles! I didn't mean it, buddy!"
ronnie,"You know, Dennis, for the longest time I made this job my whole life. I looked at this mall as a kingdom and I looked at Mark as the King. I thought of myself as the first Knight and the customers, well, they were the peasants. I lived by an old code where one was bound by duty and honor. But now I don't know if I believe in that code anymore. I've lost my way. Now I just feel like it's one big kingdom of shit. Right now, I got half a mind just to let this whole place burn. Burn it to the fucking ground!"
dennis," I've been waiting on you to get on my page this whole time. You look at this mall as a Kingdom?! Shit! I look at this place like a motherfucking jail sentence. You put on that uniform every morning, but what are you really protecting? Commerce and corporations and money. Well I say, fuck that! I'm a fucking outlaw and I'm going to live that until the day I die. Now, I can show you the way, but you've got to be willing to accept it. So I'm gonna ask you now, Ronnie. Are you ready for a trip to the other side?"
ronnie,You're goddamn right I'm ready.
dennis,Alright then.    Let's party.
dennis,"So, yeah, usually I take a joint straight to the head before I start work in this motherfucker, but on really stressful days, I like to get drunk too."
ronnie,"Fuck it, give me the bottle."
dennis,"So then I usually come in here and perv out on girls for about an hour or two. I hooked up twice last week. One was this Asian chick and the other was this mom. She wasn't that hot, but what else do I got to do?"
dennis,Sweet Jesus in the morning.
dennis,"Dressing rooms are a great place to hide out, because nobody is really going to think of looking for me here. You can nap or just kind of hang out and just really have some personal time. Hey, hand me that camera."
dennis,"Thanks, Ronnie."
dennis,Right before lunch I usually blaze up again real good.
dennis,"Hey, what's up, motherfuckers?!"
stevie,"What up, Big Den?!"
dennis,"You know, smokin' that good good."
stevie,"Dude, why are you hanging out with Ronnie?"
ronnie,"Fuck you, Stevie!"
dennis,"Hey, Ronnie's alright.   Let me see that stick."
ronnie,"Dennis, I got to thank you for today. Man, I was so down, but you taught me that I don't need to take things so seriously here. We have a pointless existence. Who gives a fuck?"
dennis,"Don't mention it, homey. I'm just glad I got me a partner in crime."
ronnie,"A partner. I like that. You know, I've never really had a friend before, but I think that this could be the beginning of a real good thing."
dennis,"You ain't even seen the best part. After everybody leaves, I rob the shit out of this place."
ronnie,What do you mean?
dennis,I steal shit!
ronnie,You're the one who's been robbing the mall?
dennis,Hell yeah!   Who'd you think it was?!
ronnie,I can't believe this. Right in front of my goddamn face this whole time!
dennis,This probably will look good with my complexion.
ronnie,"Dennis, I can't take part in this."
dennis,"Ronnie, I thought you were down?! What the fuck?! Here I am opening up myself to you and you're just gonna stick it to me like this. What the fuck has this place ever done for you? Don't you know that people see us as jokes?! A useless tool that's left in the shed. Well that's not me. Not now, not ever. I told you, I'm an outlaw."
ronnie,I can't let you rob the mall.
dennis,What the fuck you mean you can't let me?
ronnie,"Come on, Dennis. We're best friends, so just put that stuff back and let's go get a beer."
dennis,"Alright, Ronnie, you're right."
dennis,I don't really know what I was thinking. Robbing the mall? Let's just go get that beer.
ronnie,"Good, man.   That makes me feel better."
ronnie,"Ramon, get your ass over here! Go get my spare keys out of the office."
ronnie,Ramon! Goddamn it get back here! Go get my goddamn keys.
mark,"How fucking stupid do you have to be?! I mean Dennis. What the fuck, Ronnie? How could you not have known it was Dennis? Then, how the fuck could you be so stupid as to let him get away. OBSERVE AND REPORT. Those are the only two things you have to do and you can't do those worth a shit."
ronnie,Can I speak now?
mark,Go ahead.
ronnie,Are you sure?
mark,"Just start talking, Ronnie!"
ronnie,"It seems only natural that 'some people' would want to blame me and truth be told I do put a lot of that blame on myself. But some people might say that the cops are to blame for not catching them. Some people might say that the reason this happened was the undeniable fact that I was under- equipped and quite frankly, lacking a sufficient firearm. But not me. I carry this loss alone deep inside my heart."
mark,Good.   Because you're fired.
ronnie, Fuck you.
mark,"I'm serious, Ronnie. I've always liked you, but there's just no excuse for this. Somebody is going down and I'll be damned if it's going to be me. Now, don't make a big thing out of this. Just pack your shit and get out by the end of the day."
ronnie,"Wait a minute. I thought I could trust you, Mark, and now you're telling me that you're going to be the one to put the knife in my back. Fair weather friend you are."
mark,"I'm not your friend, I'm your boss."
ronnie,This isn't happening! Everybody is fucking me over?! I hate you all.
ronnie,"Wait a minute.     I'll work for free, Mark."
mark,"No, Ronnie."
ronnie,I'll pay you.
mark,Nope.
ronnie,I love you.
mark,"Ronnie, Jesus have a little self- respect."
ronnie,"You don't love me, Mark?"
mark,"Ronnie, it's over."
mom,What's on the agenda for today?
ronnie,I guess maybe look for a job or something.
mom,"Well, I know you're sad about it, but try to look on the bright side."
ronnie,There is no bright side.   My life is over.
mom,"Ronnie, you may not be smart or handsome, but you've got dreams inside of you and dreams make you special. No matter what this world tries to throw at you, they can never take those dreams away."
ronnie,"What the fuck are you talking about, Mom?"
mom,"I don't know. I'm drunk. I just know that mothers are supposed to talk like that to their children when they're sad, so I tried. What do you want from me?"
ronnie,"Thanks, Charles."
nell,"Ronnie, what are you doing here?"
ronnie,I got something I want to say.
ronnie,Son of a bitch!!!
nell,"Oh, my God!"
ronnie,Are you alright?
nell,I'm fine.
ronnie,"Shit, we should call somebody."
nell,Ronnie.
saddamn,"What the fuck, man?!"
ronnie,Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
stevie,"Dude, that's fucking disgusting!"
stevie,"Hey, Ronnie, here!"
stevie,What a fucking douche!
ronnie,Turn it down.     Turn it down.
mark,"Okay, show's over. Enjoy your shopping experience at Carolina Mall."
mark,Jesus.  Charles!
ronnie,Fuck yeah!
ronnie,Hell no.   I'm taking him down myself.
mark,"Hey, Ronnie."
mark,"Good job, Ronnie."
ronnie,"Thank you, sir."
brandi,"Good job, Ronnie."
ronnie,I caught the Pervert.
detective harrison,"I see that. Well, you better turn him over to me and I'll take him inside and book him."
ronnie,"Since you're a real Cop, right?"
detective harrison,"Hey, Ronnie, you may not be an officer of the law, but you're the law's right hand. Good job."
ronnie,"Well, being a mall security guard basically requires the same skill set that someone in say the FBI has. You have to use logic and evidence and old-fashioned common sense as well as the latest technology to deduce the criminal mind. It's what I do."
female reporter,Any last words for the folks at home.
ronnie,"Yeah, I'd just like to say that Carolina Mall is back on track and safer than ever..."
