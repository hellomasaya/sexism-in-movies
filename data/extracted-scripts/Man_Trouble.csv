Speaker,Dialogue
lewie,"Spruance, would you like to show me where it's marked smearing here...  ... because I swear, I don't see it."
joan,Sorry.   I didn't know I was.
lewie,"Also, I'd be mildly content if I could have a little less delirious self-appreciation and some small regard for remaining somewhere in the vicinity of the goddamned note."
helen,"Sssh, come on now."
joan,"No, I'm telling you, this is personally motivated. Since I moved out he's been doing this, making remarks and being... incredibly pricklike...                           * LEWIE Now, if our lovely soprano would like to stop grumbling for a moment, I'd like to take it once again. JOAN  From the beginning please."
therapist,Now I want you to look at Harry and tell him how you feel.
therapist,"Well, let's see what he wants to say here. Harry, how do you feel when she brings out this material?"
harry,"How do I feel? I feel she just overheats on every little side issue, and when I go to try and communicate with the woman, for some unknown reason she doesn't believe a damn thing I say."
adele,Oh that's a lie.
harry,"See what I mean? ADELE No, you know what this whole thing hinges from? He came to rent a building from me which is now his place of business... "
adele,"If you can't call me Adele, don't call me anything at all. "
therapist,"Better yet, can you take her by the hand and say, 'I hear what you're saying'?"
therapist,"Good.  That's good... because there's a lot of love here, isn't there.   Joan comes out the door and moves down the steps to a campus walkway."
adele,Next time I want to bring out some of our sexual hot spots.
harry,"The hell you are, honey. ADELE The hell I'm not."
melvenos,You sure nothing of value has been removed from the dwelling?
joan,"No, nothing. That's what's so disturbing. I mean, why would someone do something like this...?"
fingerprinter,Not much on the window. A few partials and a bunch of smears. MELVENOS Check out the bedroom. As he moves to the hallway leading to the bedroom:
joan,You think this is someone I know? MELVENOS Let's explore that. Have you had any recent trouble with anyone? JOAN No.
melvenos,"You're not married, I take it. Her mind is still off searching for enemies and she fails to respond: HELEN She's in the process of a divorce. MELVENOS What about him? HELEN What about him? He's our conductor, he's an artist and not someone who'd ever... JOAN You mean Lewie? He'd never do anything like this."
melvenos, You never know.
andy,"Hi, Joanie..."
joan,"So could I just call you later? ANDY Well, can't you give   me one minute? I'd like to    know if you got the manuscript I   sent you. "
joan,"Oh no. You've written a book about Red Layls. ANDY Not just about him, Joanie, he's only one of many episodes in my life, you know that. Have you got a Perrier?"
joan,"No, I don't. Let me just call you at home later. ANDY I'm not going to be home. I'm checking into a hospital to have a bone spur removed from my foot. Then I'm going to New York, to meet with a top publisher...  ... which, incidentally, I would not care for Mr. Redmon, fecal- face Layls to know. Melvenos and the Fingerprinter re-enter:                            *"
joan,"Wait, I need to talk to you..."
joan,"I wanted to ask you, if there's somebody, who for some unknown reason, doesn't like me, what do you suggest I do?"
joan,"Really though, I don't see how this could be somebody I know."
melvenos,Maybe not.
andy,"Some help I'm going to get from him, because he's scared to death of Red."
joan,"Andy, are you telling me the truth?"
joan,"I mean, are you really going to New York?"
andy,"Yes, I'm going to New York, where I intend to remain in semi-private seclusion, at an undisclosed... JOAN Well maybe I could stay at your house while you're gone. So could you tell your housekeeper to... ANDY Wait, I just want you to hear what this colosal shit said about me, through his great white shark of a lawyer. JOAN Pardon me, but I don't care what he said. My apartment, as you can                     * see, is a complete shambles, I have                   * a terrible headache, I've been                        * informed that somebody doesn't like me, and I really don't want to stay here by myself!"
andy,"Fine, why don't you take my house then?"
joan,Thank you.
andy,"Gee whiz, why make such a big deal out of everything? "
june,Ferde at something Motors. He wants two payments by tomorrow or he's gonna come an' repop the van. HARRY Bastard.
june,"You know, you said you were going to get me a little Honda Elite to tool around in."
june,"Well, I'm not. HARRY That's not the point I'm making. Suddenly irritated, he begins fumbling through a pile                  * of bills on top of the desk:"
harry,"You know   what's gonna happen if I can't pay   these damn breeders and get some   adult dogs on the premises?    Pretty damn quick, some asses are   going to hit the pavement,   believe me."
june,"So?    I'm sick of dog turds anyway. He scowls at her, then looks out the window:"
harry,"Jesus, here   I am, sitting in the center of a   lot of wealth, the escalation   in crime couldn't be better, and   I'm not turning a damn nickel   on it... He catches sight of something outside:                                 *"
joan,"I'm asking, where-are-you-going?"
socorro," Esto me yerno, Balthazar. You speak please Balto para mi."
joan,"Monday? But this is Thursday, I can't stay here alone 'til Monday."
balto,"Yeah, but she got her time off, too, man, you know. Joan straightens up, sighing angrily and looking up at the house:"
joan,"Well, this is just glorious. The low-rider moves down the driveway and as it disap- pears onto the street, Joan moves to an electric box atop a metal column at the edge of the driveway. She presses the button and looks at the gates. They remain open. She steps over to the gates and tries to close them manually. The locking device fails to engage and a portion of it falls off into the bushes."
another angle,"As she leans   down to look for the fallen part,   a pickup truck can be   seen parked down the street. The    back of the driver's head    can be seen and on   the side panel of the   truck are the words ""Canyon Tree   Surgeons."""
butch,"Well, who are you, honey?"
joan,"She's out of town, and there happens to be several other people in here trying to sleep, so..."
butch,Whyn't you come out and say hello?
joan,"Will you please go away!? BUTCH Come on, stick your head out the door an' let's see what you look like. "
joan,"Tch, where does she find these                         * people.                                                *"
butch,"I was just trying to be nice.  Go ahead an' call 'em, bitch, I don't give a shit. He leans down, picks up a dirt clod from the flower bed and throws it toward the window: BUTCH I'll just come back and kick your ass in for you."
joan,"You know, I have an extremely sensitive reaction to dog dander, so maybe I shouldn't..."
harry,Let me ask you something. I like to get a general picture of the individual situation I'm working with. 
joan,"I'm in the process of a divorce and I moved up here because my apartment was burglarized and...  But I'm not entirely alone, there's a housekeeper here, and several friends."
harry,"Well, the hills are hit heaven as far as burglaries go. And right up on Mulholland is where they found the fifth victim of the Westside Slasher..."
joan,"No, please, don't tell me about that. HARRY Believe me, I know what you're up against, being an attractive, and I take it, unattached woman, such as you are...  Ober, platz, geh am platz, bringen, komm, sitz, fuss', fahrt and blieb."
harry,"Oh, it's your sister's.  And where's she?"
joan, Am I doing this right? Shouldn't I be prepared for something?
harry,Never look at your dog.
harry,Give him the off command!
joan,"I forgot it!     You tell him!   Duke, stop!"
harry,What did I tell you?
harry,"Ordinarily I wouldn't do this, even on a temporary rental basis, because he's the absolute top security and attack dog in the country."
joan,Yes.
harry,"No kidding. Your sister's involved with Red Layls? This guy's gotta be one of the five or ten richest men in the country, with business connections all over the place. "
harry,"Boy, look at that figure. I have to say, your sister is really an attractive looking woman."
joan,"Well, that's quite a compliment. I'll have to pass it on."
harry,"Feel free to call on me for anything. Anytime of the night or day, 24 hours."
joan,"And would you also thank your... As she gestures toward June, Harry takes hold of her hand, looking earnestly at her: "
june,You big flirt.
harry,"Come on, dumpty, don't start that.  Observe the woman, for Christ sakes."
june,Oh screw her. He closes the back panel and as he moves past her:
harry,You don't screw this type of individual.
june,You would. On his way to the driver's door:
on june,grumbling as she moves to the passenger door:
june,"Well I don't, he isn't even your dog."
man,"How about a little smile. She quickly faces front and as the light changes, accelerates through the intersecion."
lewie,"This is supposed to sound virginal, ladies, so let's try to fake it."
joan,Don't do that.
joan,"You're not supposed to look him straight in the eye. EDDY You have a dog you can't look in the eye, Joan? JOAN He's not just a dog. He's a Schutzhund trained attack dog."
eddy,"Oh... He steps back from the dog as Joan leans down to give Duke some water from the cup. JOAN I was told to avoid a direct gaze and always look at the base of the right or the left ear. EDDY You don't have to go to all this trouble, I've offered to stay up at your sister's with you?"
joan,"I can't tell you how mad I am at Lewie, that I have to leave him out here, tied to a tree..."
eddy,"God, you're stubborn, Joan. "
eddy,But you won't tell me what's really bothering you. Why don't you confide in me anymore?
joan,"I do. EDDY No you don't. Come on, talk to me. Let's go have a drink after rehearsal. JOAN  Tonight? A WOMAN chorus member sticks her head out the stage door: WOMAN Eddy, you better come, he's rehearsing the tenors!"
eddy,I'm coming...!  How about tomorrow night then?
joan,I don't know.    Let's say maybe.
eddy," Well don't go out of your way, Joan."
joan,"Eddy?   Tomorrow's fine.   Okay? Before disappearing into the studio, he makes a gesture acknowledging her capitulation."
joan,I knew it.   I shouldn't have moved here.
harry,Don't worry. The dog'll take care                      * of anyone trying to get inside.
joan,Do I do that?                                           * 
joan,"I'm sorry, I can't do it with you watching me."
harry,"Okay, but keep in mind that you want to exhibit a very confident attitude. Look like you know what you're doing and where you're going. JOAN Uhm-hmm. HARRY Just remember to stop short of appearing a little dykey, because that's not attractive. JOAN But I thought that's your point, no to attract..."
harry,"No, no, you always want to remain a little bit attractive. Otherwise that can set somone off too. JOAN This is just impossible."
harry,"Sure you can, it's just a matter of degree."
joan,"Well darn it, I give up... Dropping her head into her hands. "
joan,I'm sorry but this is really getting to me.
joan,"And so you  like, well, assuming you live a  single existence, I                       * mean most  men don't seem to enjoy that, I've  read. She lifts her glass, takes a sip, then sets it back down: HARRY I have to  tell you the truth... "
joan,"Yes, anytime. Do you like Classical music?"
harry,"Very much. Even to the degree that when it's playing on the radio, I sometimes have to turn the damn thing off. Thinking he is revealing a peculiar brand of wit, she laughs. HARRY  I just mean it starts to get to me too much. I can't swallow my saliva. JOAN I'm sorry.     I shouldn't have laughed."
harry,"Yeah, symphonies, operettas, poems, things like that. All those type of things really get to me. JOAN  Uhm hmm."
joan,"You're full of surprises, Harry, you know that? That you've actually read Dante's Divine Comedy I mean... HARRY Well, it was a while back there that I did, yeah... JOAN You know that part? 'Yet as a wheel moves smoothly, free from jars, My will and my desire were turned by love, The love that moves the sun and other stars.' He nods, while Joan, hoping to disguise the extent of her emotions, looks down and begins moving her wine in circles:"
joan,"Well, anyway... I shouldn't have had so much wine... because I prefer to go a little slow here."
harry,We can go as slow as you want... why not?
harry,"Oh yeah, absolutely."
helen,"'Always trying to connect with me, proposing private rehearsals at his apartment.' You know what he asked me yesterday?"
joan,My piano tuner.
helen,"Is he weird or something? JOAN Well everyone appears weird to me                         * right now. So I put every                                 * possible name down, except for one, who happens to be post- burglary."
helen,I already did. JOAN  Helen.
lewie, Why are you resisting?
joan,"These are very upsetting, really shitty circumstances I'm dealing with and I..."
lewie,Do you know how hard all this has been on me? Do you think it's that easy for me to admit I want you back? JOAN Couldn't you spare yourself then? LEWIE Are you seeing anybody?   Just tell me that.
joan, Are you spying on me?
lewie,Come on. Be open about it. 
lewie,I don't believe you.   Who is it?
harry,What? JOAN Well...  He keeps getting up and trying to ride on one's extremities.
harry,Oh don't worry about that. 
harry,"No, that's just normal in most of your adult males. Some percentage of the time they're gonna attempt to make these vulgar motions on your person. He places his arm on the couch behind her:"
harry,You know what's affecting me?
joan,"Night-piece, it means. HARRY You are."
harry,Don't worry about it.
joan,"That's the problem though, I want to be honest with you... HARRY There's no problem. He leans over and kisses her.      After a moment she breaks off:"
joan,Because I recently realized something about myself. That I've slept with a number of men in my life just because I didn't want them not to like me. HARRY  Uhm hmm.
joan,"But the thing is, I didn't like most of them that much, so why did I care whether they liked me or not? HARRY You know, I'm not one of these guys who's going to look upon you as an object. JOAN Oh, I know, that's not what I'm saying... HARRY Because I look upon a woman as a whole. JOAN What I'm saying is I don't know if right now I might not go to bed with you because I don't want to be alone, so I thought maybe we... could try to explore other modes, or... "
joan,"I mean, there are other ways of being intimate, that people don't even realize."
harry,Uhm hmm.
joan,Which doesn't mean I'm not attracted to you.
joan,"God, it's so hard to pioneer in this area... when you keep doing that..."
joan,"Maybe I better take this. She tries to move closer to the phone, hindered by Harry's weight. ANDY  And this is the lengths this assassin is willing to go to suppress me, because he does not want me to have my book. JOAN Harry, excuse me, it's my sister. He moves off of her and she leans across his torso, pinning him to the bed as she addresses the speaker:"
joan,Andy... It's Joan.
andy,Oh you're there. Thank God.
joan,"Where are you? Are you in New York? ANDY No, that's what I'm telling you. I went into the hospital first, for one day, just to have a simple bone spur..."
andy,"And if he and that fuckface lawyer in his paid employ, think they can ... Wait.  I think I hear someone."
harry,Find out where she is. JOAN Hello? Andy? You have to tell me where you are.
joan,... because I'm sure there's some simple explanation...
joan,What should I do? Should I call the police? HARRY No.
joan,You mean right now?
harry,"Joan, can I make a suggestion? JOAN Yes, please, anything."
harry,You better try an keep up a little with the flow or we're gonna get cited.
joan,How do you know he was her physician?
harry,"Hell, I could come in here and say I was a doctor an' sign somebody out. JOAN And even if he was a doctor, it doesn't mean he was my sister's doctor. A.C. According to this he was her doctor. JOAN Then who was the doctor who operated on her foot?"
joan,"That's a lie. She was in here for an operation, then she was drugged and taken out of here against her will."
joan,"I can't believe this, you mean there's no phone number or address?"
joan,"How am I supposed to find this man? Maybe he used a false name, or maybe he isn't even a doctor..."
harry,"I've got a couple of ideas here. First, we want to try an' connect with Red Layls."
joan,"No, I don't want anything to do with Red, I'm terrified of him."
harry,"There's nothing to be afraid of, believe me. JOAN I mean, you hear all kinds of things, about government kickbacks, and Panamanian drug couriers and... HARRY I know these type of guys. You take away their money and their power, and what are they. JOAN No, really, I have to do something. I have to go to the police... He stops walking and takes a hold of her hand:"
harry,"Just hold off a bit on that, honey, will you?"
joan,"Oh, that's nice."
harry,What? JOAN You called me honey.
harry,Well that's what you are. 
vita,"Oh.   Fred, you mean? HARRY Yeah, that's him. How do you think I could get a hold of him? VITA Oh gee, I think he's moved out of the area and went into gourmet                         * snacks.                                                *"
moncrief,"I think it's in your best interest to hear me out. HARRY No, you hear me out, friend... He takes note of the driver  coming around the front of the car. He stops a few feet off and unbuttons his jacket, revealing the cross-strap of a shoulder holster."
moncrief,Well I don't want to appear to be taking unfair advantage of you... 
moncrief,"But in developing certain information on you, it's come to our attention that your name isn't Harry Bliss. That in fact, your name is Eugene Earl Axline... * HARRY Wait a minute."
moncrief,"And that both the I.R.S., and an impressive number of creditors in several Eastern cities...  I can't go sneaking around, stealing this lady's property."
moncrief,"I'd like to pose that the name and reputation of this very decent man, is not the property of Mrs. Ellerman, or her sister.                       * He takes a voucher from the folder and sets the file aside:"
harry,"What do you mean, 'unpleasant'? MONCRIEF I mean that Mr. Layls is prepared to do whatever it takes to confiscate this document. And if you'd like to be of some assistance                   * to us, by finding it and turning                      * it over to me, he'd like to offer                     * you this very generous gift.                          * He holds the voucher out to Harry who avoids looking at it: HARRY Jesus Christ, I hardly know the woman. I'm just renting a dog to her, that's all.  What kind of a person do you take me for? Harry stands in the parking lot, watching as the Con- tinental drives off. He starts to move toward The House of Bliss, then stops and opens the voucher, braving a look at it."
on butch,"He watches sullenly as her car disappears through the gates, then lifts a can of beer to his mouth and drinks.  55   INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/DEN - DAY                                  55  Joan searches through the file cabinets and not finding what she's looking for, goes through a similar course of procedure with the desk drawers."
joan,"Oh, Socorro..."
joan,"I-am-looking-for-my-sister's-book. Socorro steps closer and glancing into the the now disorderly contents of the drawer, shakes her head defensively: SOCORRO No.   No es mi. "
harry,"Oh come on, you're way off. JOAN And that he's been trying to scare and intimidate me in case I might have read something in her manuscript that he doesn't want anybody to know. And you know what he said? That I haven't given him probable cause to even go and question Red Layls, or his lawyer... HARRY Well, he's right, I could've told you that. This is a man who goes fishing with the President, honey.  Life's too godammed short. JOAN I can't do that, Harry. This is my sister. I can at least make out a missing persons report on her, and then I want to talk to the private detective friend of yours. HARRY I'm trying to chase the guy down, okay? But don't go and make yourself sick... He begins pushing the paraphernalia around on his desk:"
harry,"I mean, Jesus, why don't you just get this damn thing and hand it over to me and I'll give it to these guys. "
harry,"Yeah, to Red, or whoever..."
joan,"Well if I ever find, it, that's the last thing I'd do with it. HARRY Dammit, you're making my work more difficult for me, you know that! JOAN What is this, have I come at the wrong time or something? HARRY I tell you what the hell to do and you don't listen to me! Joan looks down at the floor, attempting a drollery:"
joan,"Well, someone abates your maidenhood and suddenly feels they can start ordering you around. HARRY I'm not ordering you around. I'm just giving you my opinion. And maybe I get tired of hearing about this stuff all the time, this book business, this manu-whatever, and Red Layls, and your sister."
joan,"Oh.  Well...  So why don't we speak when you're in a better frame of mind. As she crosss to the door, Harry stands up:"
harry,"Ah honey, now... "
on harry,"again seated at his desk. He stares out the window, in the throes of a moral conflict. Then making some sudden resolve he opens a drawer, takes out an envelope and a paperback book and lays them on the desk."
joan,"Oh, Socorro, please-keep-the-dog ... el perro, in... in piso inferior, por favor... exercise room... Tiene allergy... "
harry,"I mean, what's wrong with these women."
june,You want a know something?
harry,"They don't want to hear the truth, that's what disturbs me. "
june,"I know one guy that says very complimentary things to me, like that I have nice features and a sense of humor.                                       * HARRY What guy?"
june,"Some guy I met, that likes me. He looks at her, then reaches over and places a hand affectionately on the nape of her neck: HARRY You're going to leave me, lard, just after I've broken you in, and taught you the fine art of dog training?"
june,Maybe.  What's the score?
joan,"Helen, quick, get in the car! Helen leans down and looks in at her:"
helen,What?
helen,I can't!   I can't move!!
joan,"I told you, he was in the house."
harry,What the hell good is that! You have to have him with you at all times!
harry,"Yeah, but that's before he tried to part your hair with an axe! JOAN I don't know if it was him.   Maybe it was this tree surgeon... She starts to move toward the bedroom and he stops her: HARRY Wait a minute. How tall was he? About six one? Kind of ugly? Helen, now with a drink in her hand, steps INTO VIEW behind Harry:"
helen,He was about your height.
joan,"No, he wasn't, he was much taller. HELEN Well let's not quibble, for god sakes. The  man is a complete maniac... "
harry,"Guy like Red Layls have hit men working for them, that drive them around and do their dirty work for them."
joan,"Gee whiz, first it isn't Red, now it is Red. I can't keep up with these sudden reversals. HELEN Alright... I'm calling a cab. ON Helen, as she clumps away in the direction of the guest bedroom:"
joan,It doesn't seem like something he'd do.
harry,"Dammit, Joan!! She steps out of the closet and comes toward the bedroom,        * dressed in one of Andy's negligees."
joan,"God, what is this?! I can't say anything to you anymore, you're so darn touchy!"
harry,"You can mention anything you want,                     * honey. I'm just trying to keep you from turning up face down, that's all. After a moment: HARRY                            * I mean, I can't leave you up here alone now..."
harry,It's very becoming on you.
harry,Yes you do.
joan,Well?
joan,What are you going to do now?   Are you going to leave?
harry,"Yeah, I'm going to skip down the hill, take care of a few things, pick up some clothes... JOAN Could you be back for dinner, around 7:00? HARRY Yeah.   Sure. JOAN Good. She waves to him     and pulls the rest of the way out of the garage, revealing     the ax handle still embedded in the front of the car,     its handle sharply angled up from the hood like a soup     ladle. "
socorro,"Ah si, es okay."
adele,Harry! What the hell do you think you're doing?
harry,"I just got a phone call, honey, from a prominent entertainer up in Vegas, a very well-known singer..."
adele,"Who is it, Paul Anka?"
harry,"He's a rock star, you probably wouldn't know the name. Anyway, I gotta run a couple a dogs up to him..."
adele,"You know, it's T-minus zero and counting, Harry, on this whole shitty deal. HARRY Now Iwo, don't blow this way out of proportion. You  think I want to do this. I need  the extra cash right now, believe me. ADELE If you leave, I'm getting Top Lock to come over and change the front and back doors!"
harry,"Come on now, honey, don't say things like that... He puts an arm around her, giving her a perfunctory hug:"
joan,"You're welcome. HARRY Yeah it's great and it's something I really needed, so... He leans over and kisses her on the cheek, then picks up his fork and begins poking with disinterest at his food."
harry,"What? JOAN I was just thinking that I find this moody side of you very attractive. HARRY Oh, uh-huh. JOAN In fact, if you want to know, and I can see you're dying to...  I completely adore you. HARRY Well, same here, honey."
joan,Why are you all wet?
joan, Can you believe this?!
joan,Do you see that?
joan,What did she say? San Dimas?  Where's San Dimas?
joan,"And now when I suddenly feel like I could save the Pope in an earthquake, you start trying to... HARRY This is not the Pope we're talking about here, believe me."
joan,That's just a figure of speech. They disappear out the front door.
harry, Jesus Christ.
harry,"Okay, just let me drive the goddamned car, that's all I ask."
joan,"Why should I let you drive? HARRY Why? I'll tell you why, because you're a terrible driver, that's why."
joan,"Oh, now all the ugly little truths are coming out. HARRY You operate this vehicle like it was a cane with a red tip painted on the end of it."
joan,"Don't talk to me, Harry. I mean it, just don't say another word to me!"
harry, Driving around with a goddamned ax stuck in your car... JOAN And now look at me.   I've got purpose tremors...
joan,Okay.   What?
long shot,"ON Harry, Joan and Nurse One. Presently the Nurse ges- tures to a stairwell leading to the second floor. Joan and Harry move in the direction indicated.  ON HARRY AND JOAN  Moving into the stairwell."
joan,I hope you know what you're doing.
harry,Don't worry.   Just do what I told you. They approach room 206. 
harry,"What's the problem, dear? NURSE ONE We're trying to contact Doctor                     * Park, just to be sure he's authorized you to examine Mrs. Ellerman, because you know, we have to follow certain... HARRY I understand.    You're doing your job. NURSE ONE  Where did your assistant...? HARRY She had to step inside for a moment, to relieve herself."
andy,"And if this little kinglet of corporate shit thinks he can get away with this, he's greatly mistaken. Just wait 'til he hears what I'm going to come out with now."
andy,"Remember when he passed me off as staff and I was put on official government payroll all through Maui and the Yucatan Mission? JOAN No, I don't.   And hurry up, will you. And as Andy steps into the skirt, Joan takes over the uncompleted buttoning chores:"
andy,"Yes you do, remember, when I almost died of the vomito negro? Well that's when he was doing all that illegal oil drilling off the Mexican Gulf... She turns to look critically at her face in the mirror:"
andy,Have you got any lipstick?
nurse one,I assume you're a fairly recent associate of the doctor's?
harry,That's very correct. 
nurse one,"Oh, so Dr. Park feels there's a gynecological involvement here."
harry,"Sometimes he does, yes.  Oh, well, no, they haven't... Her attention is diverted to a SECOND NURSE entering the wing, calling out to her and making a summoning gesture: NURSE ONE Excuse me a minute, Doctor. Harry watches as she moves away, and while the two Nurses engage in an exchange some distance down the hall, he steps back to the door, opens it and sticks his head inside:"
his pov,"of Joan and Andy, the former whispering urgently in ref- erence to the latter's red hair: JOAN What about her hair?"
andy,Who's he?
harry,Which way?
harry,"Don't mention it. The Nurse watches briefly as they move away, then extracting a key from her pocket, she steps over to the door and locks it."
andy,You know what that prick had his lawyer say to me?
harry,"Here, put this on. ANDY I mean, the arrogance...  What did she say your name was?"
harry,Harry.
andy," Have you got a cigarette, Harry?"
harry,Fuck! He turns and moves OUT OF SIGHT.
joan,"Christ. A soft WHISTLE comes from the vicinity of the windows behind her, followed by Harry's voice, whispering: HARRY  Joan?   Are you there?"
her pov,"He stands several feet below, looking up at the window."
harry,Is that you?
joan,"Yes, it's me.    Hurry up, will you!"
joan,"Don't worry, honey..."
joan,"You have to get me out of here! HARRY Everything's under control, just hang on a few more minutes and I'll be right back, okay? As he moves out of sight, her attention is drawn to the sound of MUFFLED VOICES in the hallway. In a panic, she starts toward the bathroom, changes her mind, moves to the bed and gets into it. As the door begins to open, she grabs one of the pillows and quickly covers her head with it."
his pov," of the unresponsive figure under the covers.  BACK TO SCENE MONCRIEF Would you care to sit up for a minute? I'd like to talk to you.  91   EXT. MONROE PARK CENTER/PARKING LOT - NIGHT                    91  ON Andy in the driver's seat of the Mercedes. The window is rolled up and she puffs impatiently on a cigarette. Presently, she catches sight of something out the driver's window and turns to look:    MAN TROUBLE - Rev. 4/22/91                            94.  91   CONTINUED:                                                  91 A sleek black car with opaque'd windows pulls into a parking slot several yards away. A faded male beauty, somewhere in his 50s, gets out of the rear passenger door and as he moves to the walkway leading to the hospital grounds:  She quickly rolls down the window and angrily addresses him: ANDY You son of a bitch!  RED LAYLS looks toward the Mercedes and as he approaches, we can see a medical beeper attached to his belt."
andy,Who the hell do you think it is?! RED Sweetheart?   Is that you? She pulls the dark glasses off...
andy,"No thanks to you, it's me. ... and throws them onto the dashboard."
joan,Andy's not here.
moncrief,"I can see that, Miss Spruance. Would you care to tell me where she is?"
joan,"As a matter of fact, she happens to be on her way to the police right now, accompanied by a close friend of mine... Her bluff is immediately belied by:"
moncrief,"I think you better come in here, Mr. Bliss."
joan,"Just go get Andy and leave, will you! HARRY That's what I'm trying to tell you... MONCRIEF I'm a little disappointed to find you defaulting on our agreement."
harry," This asshole approached me and tried to bribe me into working for them, and I told him to go to hell!"
moncrief,I believe an agreement was implicit in your acceptance of my check.
harry,"Honey, don't go by anything this guy says, because I'm the only one who knows what the hell I'm doing.  See? I never cashed the fucking thing!"
joan,No you're not.  What did that bastard do to you?
andy,I need a Kleenex. She moves toward the nightstand with Joan following:
andy,"Wait, I want to tell you what he said to me... She extracts a tissue from a dispenser on the nightstand:"
joan,What?! ANDY And when he said it...  ... he had a tear in his eye...
red," Get me something cold to drink, will you?"
moncrief,Certainly.
joan,"Andy, you don't know what you're saying. You're suffering from hostage syndrome or something."
joan,You 'love' him?!
andy,"Yes, he's been a very important man in my life, you know that. JOAN  Oh, now he's not a fecal-faced, great white shark!"
on harry,"Stepping into the doorway, holding Struge in a painful armlock: HARRY Alright, what the hell's going on in here? RED Who's this?"
moncrief,That's the dog trainer. RED I thought he was working for us.
harry,Mr. Layls...
harry,"I just  want a say, that though you're  someone in a category I admire,  you've gone to some lengths  on this thing here, that I don't  entirely agree with..."
red,Sit down. I have a neck condition and it aggravates me to have to look up at you.
harry,"Okay.   No problem. As he seats himself in the other chair, Red reaches up and takes a glass of tea offered by Moncrief:"
red, More sugar.
joan,"And furthermore, this 'sensitive' man's lawyer more than implied they were willing to put your feet, as well as probably mine, into a block of cement! ANDY Oh that's just all talk...  Would somebody please get me my clothes!"
joan,"Harry, I can't believe you're sitting there nodding your head and having a tea party with these crooks! HARRY I'm not nodding my head, honey, I'm just listening to the man."
on andy,"as Harry, in the b.g., resumes his exchange with Red: ANDY Who is this guy, anyway? Isn't he a little sleazy, Joanie, a bit infra dig? I mean Lewie's a bit of a stiff, but..."
joan,"You're going to talk to me about sleaze, when you consorted with some maniac tree surgeon, who was flicking his tongue out at me like some rutting iguana, and groping at his naturalia at three in the morning?!"
andy,"Oh, 'him.'"
andy,"Well, he's very immature."
on joan,"As Moncrief steps up to her, offering a glass of tea:"
moncrief,"Miss Spruance, would you care for a..."
joan,"No, thank you. She moves past him, striding over to Harry and Red: JOAN  Excuse me!"
on red,"Raising a baleful eye to Joan: JOAN     I don't know what    kind of spell you've cast on my    sister, but it doesn't extend to    me..."
on joan,Standing above Layls:
joan," ... Not only for having my apartment burglarized but for breaking into Andy's house, as well as hiring someone to frighten, harass and intimidate me!"
joan,"No, Dammit!"
joan, I'm not here to beg your good opinion...
red,What is it?
joan,"Andy, you know something?"
andy,"Well if you're going to take this kind of grumpy attitude, I certainly won't."
harry,Uh...
joan,"No, I don't. RED Will you people be quiet, I can't hear this.  Go ahead."
moncrief,"I wanted to tell you a moment ago, that I was privileged to see you at the Bowl on the Fourth of July..."
harry,So what.   I'm talking to this lady...
moncrief,"And I was especially moved by your rendition of 'The Battle Hymn of The...' Harry suddenly grabs Moncrief roughly by the arm: HARRY Never mind that shit.   Tell her... He shakes him, causing him to spill his iced tea onto the front of his jacket:"
moncrief,"Well, shall we start with the fact that you're a married man...  ... and then go on from there?"
harry,"Wait a minute, honey... As she disappears inside, Red re-enters, and covering the speaker vents on the beeper, strides over to Moncrief:"
red,"You know whose heart this body- snatcher is trying to give me?! A victim of somebody called the Westside Slasher! And this is the doctor you recommended to me!  You're killing me, Monroe! You know that?! You're pushing me to the goddamned wall! Joan comes out of the bathroom with the doctor's jacket and moves immediately to the hallway door and exits."
harry,"Honey,   there's a simple explanation to all   of this, if you want me to go into   it... I was trying to tell you at   dinner... She disappears into an intersecting hallway."
red,What in the hell should I do?! 
andy,"So let's just go there, sweetheart, and have him sew the darn thing in."
harry,"Look, you know, you live a life, honey, you make some mistakes. You get married for maybe mutual benefits, or business considerations weighing on you at the time, and because you don't think the right person is ever going to come along. JOAN I would never have knowingly become involved with a married man. HARRY I know that, that's why I was trying to come out and tell you..."
joan,"Please, I don't want to discuss it anymore.  I bet you never read Dante, either."
harry,"Now there you're 75 percent wrong. JOAN I mean, I can't believe it, that you'd lie to me about this... HARRY Okay, I lied. Didn't you ever tell a lie? If not let me kiss your high heel. JOAN I'm going in the house. "
harry,"Don't say that, please. I'm asking you to just give me the chance to clear up all these things in my life, because... JOAN No. I didn't extricate myself from the infidelities of one man, just to fall into the arms of the prince of prevaricators... HARRY Well, I may be all kinds of a son of a bitch, and the prince of whatever, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't, when it comes down to it, stand up and take the bullet for you. She finally looks over at him, her eyes brimming with tears: JOAN That's not what I observed, Harry."
harry,"Look, our agreement was I could buy the dog back. He's  the only thing I got to prove to people what I can do, and all I'm asking you, Lee, is... "
harry,"No, I don't want the dog."
helen,"A few of us are going to grab a bite. You want to join us? JOAN No, go ahead.    I'm not hungry. HELEN Well, who's going to drive you home?"
joan,"I'll call a cab. Eddy steps INTO FRAME: EDDY I can take her home. HELEN Good, because I don't want you to be alone. Alright?  See you tomorrow. She moves away and Joan returns her attention to the mirror, then:"
joan,"Thank you, Eddy."
eddy,No. I'm not in a bad mood.   Not as bad as yours.
eddy,"Remember when we were on tour in Japan, in '86?"
joan,"That was witty of me. EDDY But you weren't. Because an hour later, you went into Lewie's room and you didn't come out. JOAN Well, if you remember, I was in love with Lewis around that time, which I confided to you, so you did know... EDDY That's not the reason. JOAN Excuse me, Eddy, you just passed the turn off to my street. No response."
eddy,"I just want to drive a little, so                   * we can talk."
joan,"Why did you do these things? EDDY Because you deserved it. JOAN I didn't deserve it. I've always thought of you and treated you as one of my closest and dearest friends... EDDY I use to think very highly of you, too, but now I don't like what I see. In fact, it's been very disturbing to me, Joan.  Very disillusioning. To see that before you've even gotten rid of Lewie, you've started up with some other man. JOAN Eddy, I want you to take me home now."
eddy,"You know, there's so  many things about me you have no  idea of. You never ask me about my  life or what I'm thinking, because  you have no interest... JOAN Yes I do. You can tell me whatever you want to, but let's go back down to..."
joan,Eddy...
eddy,"You present yourself like you are, but you're not...  Don't you think I know that, better than anybody? He takes her arm and places it around his neck."
eddy,"I want you to listen to me, and I                      * want you to kiss me. And this time, like you mean it..."
harry,"Okay, what is this! What the hell are you doing with this guy! He reaches in and pulls Eddy away from Joan. JOAN Harry, look out! The warning is simultaneous with an attempt by Eddy to stab him with the knife. HARRY Jesus Christ... He grabs Eddy's arm and in hauling him out of the car, rips loose the sleeve of Eddy's shirt."
on van,"She pulls open the door and addressing the dog inside, points toward Harry and Eddy:"
joan,"Duke, fasse!"
joan,"You bastards!! The search beam of the COPTER spotlights Joan. She is bent over, picking up sticks and stones and as if routing a deadly enemy, she begins hurling them, as well as a series of invectives, at the lights of the city below, her words barely audible over the sound of the ROTORS. The beam sweeps from her, to pick up Harry and Eddy and an AMPLIFIED, God-like voice comes from above: VOICE  What are you people doing down there?"
harry,"Are you crazy?! What are you doing, running around with a guy like this!!"
joan,You maniacs!!    You liars!!   You shits!! 
joan,He's not the Westside Slasher!!
voice," Ma'am, is this guy bothering you?"
joan,"I wasn't kissing him!! VOICE  Stand where you are, and put down the knife."
on joan,Perceiving the danger to Harry:
joan,"Put the knife down, Harry! "
voice," Don't worry, lady, we've got a car on the way."
harry,"I just wanted to tell you, because you don't know, how important you are to me..."
voice," Step away from him, ma'am."
harry,"And I   needed you to know this one other   thing about me, because I don't   want to withhold anything from   you anymore... JOAN Oh God, I don't want to know, Harry. What is it? HARRY My real name's not Harry.    It's Eugene. JOAN  'Eugene.' I love that name."
on andy,"restively fanning herself with a programme, seated in an aisle seat next to Moncrief.  125A   EXT. KENNEL ENCLOSURE - NIGHT                              125A  MUSIC OVER: Lee MacGreevy opens the enclosure, puts Duke inside and MOVES OUT OF FRAME. Duke paces unhappily back and forth."
on eugene,He returns her smile. His eyes shine and glisten with emotion and an expression of undissembled and openly childlike delight takes shape upon his face. CREDITS FINISH.   The SCREEN GOES BLACK.   The MUSIC CONCLUDES.
