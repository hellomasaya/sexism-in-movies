Speaker,Dialogue
coraline,Hello?...   Who's there?
coraline,"You scared me to death, you mangy thing!"
wybie,"  Hoo! Let me guess, you're from Texas or Utah; someplace dried out and barren, right? I heard about water-witching before but it doesn't make sense; I mean, it's just an ordinary branch."
coraline,   IT'S A DOWSING ROD!
wybie,Ow!
coraline,"And I DON'T LIKE BEING STALKED, not by  PSYCHO-NERDS OR THEIR CATS!"
wybie,"He's not really my cat; he's kinda feral you know, wild? Of course, I do feed him every night and sometimes he'll come in my window `n bring me little dead things."
coraline,"  Look, I'm from Pontiac."
wybie,Huh?
coraline,"MICHIGAN? And if I'm a ""water witch"",  THEN--  --where's the secret WELL?"
wybie,You stomp too hard and you'll fall in it!
coraline,  Huh.
wybie,Surprised she let you move in...
coraline,What do you mean?
wybie, Uh... I'm not supposed to talk about it.
coraline,  Wybie?
wybie,"Short for Wyborne. Not my idea, of course. What'd you get saddled with?"
coraline,I wasn't saddled with anything. It's Coraline.
wybie,Caroline what?
coraline,Coraline. Coraline Jones.
wybie," Hmmm... It's not real scientific, but I heard an ordinary name, like Caroline --"
coraline,"I think I heard someone calling you, Wyborne."
wybie,What? I didn't hear anything--
coraline,"Oh, I definitely heard someone, Why-were- you-born."
wybie, Grandma!
coraline,  Why?
coraline,Ehh!!
coraline,"I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom."
mel, Uh huh.
coraline,I would have died.
mel, That's nice.
coraline,Hmmm. So can I go out? I think it's perfect weather for gardening.
mel,"No, Coraline. Rain makes mud. Mud makes a mess."
coraline,"But Mom, I want stuff growing when my friends come to visit. Isn't that why we moved here?"
mel,Something like that. But then we had the accident.
coraline,Wasn't my fault you hit that truck.
mel,I never said it was.
coraline,  I can't believe it -- you and Dad get paid to write about plants and you hate dirt.
mel,"Coraline, I don't have time for you right now. And you still have unpacking to do. Lots of unpacking."
coraline,That sounds exciting.
coraline, Huh... a little me? That's weird.
mel,"What's his name, anyway?"
coraline,Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls.
coraline,"Hey Dad, how's the writing going?... Dad?"
charlie,"Hello, Coraline...  And... Coraline doll?..."
coraline,D'you know where the garden tools are?
charlie,"It's pouring out there, isn't it."
coraline,"Humph, it's just raining."
charlie,What'd the boss say?
coraline,"  ""Don't even think about going out, Coraline Jones."""
charlie,Then you won't need the tools.
coraline,So?
charlie,So explore it!
coraline,Ewww!
charlie,"No, no, no, no, no; GAAAA--!"
coraline,One boring blue boy in a painfully boring painting ... four incredibly boring windows ... and no... more... doors...
mel,"I'm really, really busy!"
coraline,I think it's locked.
mel,Uhhh...
mel,Will you stop pestering me if I do this for you?
coraline,Bricks? I don't get it.
mel,They must have closed this off when they divided up the house.
coraline,You're kidding? And why is the door so small?
mel,We made a deal. ZIP IT!
coraline,You didn't lock it.
charlie,"I think you are so nice, I give you bowls of porridge And I give you bowls of ice --"
charlie, -- cream!
coraline,"Why don't you ever cook, Mom?"
mel,"Coraline, we've been through this before: your Dad cooks, I clean, and you stay out of the way."
coraline,Looks more like slime to me.
charlie,"Well, it's slime or bedtime fusspot -- now what's it going to be?"
coraline,Think they're trying to poison me?
coraline,"Don't forget about me, guys. Okay?"
coraline,Whoa...
coraline,Huh?
coraline,Mom?! What are you doing here in the middle of the night?
other mother,"You're just in time for supper, dear!"
coraline,You're not my mother.
other mother,B-b-b-buttons? Do you like them?
coraline,Hello?
other father,"Hello, Coraline. Want to hear my new song?"
coraline,My father can't play piano.
other father,No need to ... this piano plays ME!
coraline,"I, uh  sorry  but she said to tell you the food's ready."
other father,Mmmmm! Who's starving? Raise your hand.
other father,"We give our thanks and ask to bless, Our Mother's golden chicken breast!"
coraline,"Mmmm, this chicken is good."
other mother,"Hungry, aren't you."
coraline, D'you have any gravy?
other mother,"Well, here comes the gravy train! Choo- choo!"
other mother,"Another roll, sweet peas? Corn on the cob?"
coraline, I'm real thirsty.
other mother,Of course! Any requests?
coraline,Mango milk shake?
other mother,"We've been waiting for you, Coraline."
coraline,For me?
other father,"Yep. Wasn't the same here without you, kiddo."
coraline,I didn't know I had an Other Mother.
other mother,Of course you do. Everyone does.
coraline,Really?
other mother,"Uh huh, and soon as you're through eating, I thought we'd play a game."
coraline,"  You mean like, hide and seek?"
other mother,Perfect! Hide and seek in the rain.
coraline,What rain?
other father,We love mud here!
other mother,"Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies -- it's great for poison oak."
coraline,  How'd you know I--
other mother,But I'm your other mother.
coraline,  I think I should get to bed.
other mother,"Of course, sweetheart, it's all made up."
coraline, But ...
other father,"Come along, sleepyhead."
coraline,Wow.
dragonflies,"Hello Coraline, hello, hello!"
toy squid,"What's shakin', baby?"
coraline,Hello.
coraline,"Kripes a-mighty, how are my best trolls? I can't wait till summer. You're both comin', right?"
coraline,"Oh, the mud..."
pull back match, DISSOLVE:
coraline,"  It's gone, my poison oak, it's gone!..."
coraline,  Huh?
coraline,"It was incredibly real, Mom! Only you weren't really you; you were my other mother."
mel,"  Coraline, you only dreamed you ate all that chicken. Take your multi-vitamin, at least."
coraline,"You were in the dream too, Dad. You had wild-looking pajamas and orange monkey slippers."
charlie, Orange? My monkey slippers are blue.
mel,"If the real Charlie Jones wants his pages edited, he'd better wrap them up ASAP."
coraline,Miss Spink and Forcible? But you said they're dingbats.
mel,  Uh huh.
coraline,Bo-bin-sky...Bo-bin-sky....Bo-bin-sky...
coraline,H-hello?...
coraline,"  Circus?... Oh, uh, I brought this for you."
coraline,Huh?
coraline,Meeshkas?
coraline,"Oh, sorry. I'm Coraline Jones."

coraline," Oompah oompah, toodle toot, toodle toot."
coraline,No!!!
coraline,The...jumping mice?
coraline,The one behind the wall paper? But... it's all bricked up.
miss spink,"  How nice to see you, Caroline. Would you like to come in? We're playing cards."
coraline,"Still Coraline, Miss Spink."
miss spink," Miriam, put the kettle on!"
miss forcible,"April, I think you're being followed."
miss spink,"It's the new neighbor, Miriam - Caroline? She'll be having the Oolong tea."
miss forcible,"No, no, no, no. I'm sure she'd prefer Jasmine."
miss spink,"No, Oolong."
miss forcible,"Ah, Jasmine it is, then."
miss spink,"Come on, boys!"
coraline,  Are those dogs .... real?
miss spink, 
miss forcible,"Oh go on, have one  it's hand-pulled taffy from Brighton  best in the world."
coraline,Read what?
miss spink,"Oh, your tea leaves, dear. They'll tell me your future. Drink up then, go on."
miss forcible,"Oh, give me that cup, April, your eyes are going."
miss spink,My eyes! You're blind as a bat!
miss forcible,"Oh, now, ummm... not to worry, child, it's good news: there's a tall, handsome beast in your future."
coraline,A what?
miss spink,"Miriam, oh really, you're holding it wrong."
coraline,What do you see?
miss spink,  I see a very peculiar hand...
miss forcible,I see a giraffe.
miss spink,"Giraffes don't just fall from the sky, Miriam."
miss forcible,"Oh, lord!"
coraline,"Well, what should I do?"
miss spink,Never wear green in your dressing room.
miss forcible,Acquire a very tall step ladder.
miss spink,"And be very, very careful. Now, was there something you came to tell us?"
coraline,"No, I guess not. Thanks for the tea, though."
miss forcible,Toodle-oo.
miss spink,Cheery-bye.
coraline, Danger?
wybie,Owwwwwwww!
coraline,"Great, the village stalker."
wybie,Ow. I - I wasn't stalking you. We're hunting banana slugs.
coraline,"What d'ya mean, ""we?"""
wybie,What? He hates to get his feet wet. Geez.
coraline,  Wuss-puss...
wybie,Oh no; I found it that way. It's older than Gramma -- old as this house prob'ly.
coraline," C'mom - blue hair, my swampers and raincoat?"
wybie,"Dang, check out Slugzilla!"
coraline,  You're just like them.
wybie,Huh?
coraline,I meant my parents; they don't listen to me either.
wybie,Uh huh... You mind?
coraline,Ew!
wybie,"You know, I've never been inside the Pink Palace."
coraline,  You're kidding.
wybie,Grandma would kill me. Thinks it's dangerous or something.
coraline,Dangerous?
wybie,Well... she had a twin sister.
coraline,So?
wybie,"Uhhh, I-I don't know."
wybie,"Look, I gotta go."
coraline,Wait a minute!

coraline,Mmmm...so good!
other father,"I love dinner, breakfast food."
other mother,"Coraline, Mr. Bobinsky has invited you to come see the Jumping Mice perform after dinner."
coraline,"Really. That know-it-all Wybie said it was all in Mr. B's head, I knew he was wrong."
other father,"Well, everything's right in this world, Kiddo."
other mother,Your father and I will clean up while you and your friend head upstairs.
coraline,My friend?
other mother,"I thought you'd like him more, if he spoke a little less.  So I fixed him."
coraline,So he can't talk at all?
other mother,Nope.
coraline,"Hmm, I like it."
other mother,"  Now run along, you two, and have fun."
coraline,"You're awful cheerful, considering you can't say anything."
coraline,Whoa... cool!

coraline,A-mazing!

charlie,You sure you won't come?
mel," Don't fret, Charlie, they'll love the new catalog. At least, they'll love my chapters."
charlie,"Well, I guess I'll see you around, you dizzy dreamer."
coraline,Da-ad! I'm not five anymore.
young rascal,My kingdom for a hooooooorse!!!!
mel,Put them back.
coraline,"But Mom, the whole school's gonna wear boring gray clothes. No one will have these."
mel,Put them back.
coraline,My other mother would get them.
mel,Maybe she should buy all your clothes.
coraline,So what do you think's in the other apartment?
mel,I don't know. Not a family of Jones imposters.
coraline,Then why'd you lock the door?
mel," Oh, I found some rat crap and... I thought you'd feel ... safer."
coraline,"They're jumping-mice, Mom! And the dreams aren't dangerous; they're the most fun I've had since we've moved here."
mel,Your school might be fun.
coraline,With those stupid uniforms?   Right.
mel,Had to give it a try.
mel,How do you feel about a mustard-ketchup- salsa wrap for lunch?
coraline,Are you kidding me?
mel,Mmm... Had to go food shopping anyway. Dad's planning something special.
coraline,Gross-gusting.
mel,  You wanna come along? You can pick out something you like.
coraline,"Oh, like the gloves?"
mel,"Look, Coraline... if things go well today, I promise I'll make it up."
coraline,That's what you always say.
mel,Won't be long.
coraline,  But I might be...
coraline,  I knew it was real!
coraline,Hmmm... Wybie's got a cat like you at home. Not the quiet Wybie; the one that talks too much. You must be the Other Cat.
cat,No. I'm not the other anything. I'm me.
coraline,"Um... I can see you don't have button eyes. But if you're the same cat, how can you talk?"
cat,I just can.
coraline,Cats don't talk at home.
cat,No?
coraline,Nope.
cat,"  Well, you're clearly the expert on these things. After all, I'm just a big fat wuss puss."
coraline,"Come back. Please? I... I'm sorry I called you that, I really am."
cat,I've been coming here for a while.
coraline,  The Other Mother hates cats?
cat,"  Not like any ""mother"" I've ever known."
coraline,What do you mean? She's amazing!
cat,You probably think this world is a dream come true. But you're wrong. The Other Wybie told me so.
coraline,That's nonsense. He can't talk.
cat,"Perhaps not to you. We cats, however, have far superior senses than humans and can see and smell, and --"
coraline,"Hey, Wybie."
coraline, Oh my God.
coraline,  I can't look!
young forcible,What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason!

coraline,Yeah!!
other father,Hey there.
other mother,"Was it wonderful, dear?"
coraline,"Oh yeah. They swooped down and pulled me right out of my seat  Spink and Forcible. Only they weren't old ladies, that was just a disguise. But then, I was flying through the air and... it was, it was magic."
other mother,"You do like it here, don't you, Coraline?"
coraline," Uh-huh! Good night, Wybie."
other mother,You could stay here forever... if you want to.
coraline,Really?
other father,"Sure...we'll sing and play games, and Mother will cook your favorite meals."
other mother,There's one tiny little thing we need to do.
coraline,What's that?
other father,"Well, it's a surprise."
other mother,For you ... our little doll.
coraline, NO WAY!
other mother,"Oh, but we need a yes ... if you want to stay here."
other father,  So sharp you won't feel a thi-- Oww!
other mother,"There now; it's your decision, darling. We only want what's best for you."
coraline,I'm... I'm going to bed! RIGHT NOW!
other mother,  Bed?
other father,Before dinner?
coraline,"I'm really, really tired. Yeah...  I just need to sleep on things."
other mother,"Well of course you do, darling... I'll be happy to tuck you in."
coraline," Oh, no thanks, uh, you-you've done so much already--"
other mother,You're welcome. And I  Soon you'll see things our way.

other father,No point; he pulled a long face...
cat,And what do you think you're doing?
coraline,"Well, I'm gettin' outta here. That's what I'M doing."
cat,Nothing out here ... it's the empty part of this world. She only made what she knew would impress you.
coraline,But why? Why does she want me?
coraline,"Eat? That's ridiculous, mothers don't eat daughters!"
cat,I don't know. How do you taste?
coraline,Huh? But how can you walk away from something and still come back to it?
cat,Walk around the world.
coraline,Small world.
cat,Hang on--
coraline,"Stop, he's one of the circus mice!"
cat,"I don't like rats at the best of times, but this one was sounding an alarm."
coraline,Gooooood kitty.
coraline,I want to be with my real mom and dad. I want you to let me go.
other mother,Is that any way to talk to your mother?
coraline,You aren't my mother.
other mother,"Apologize at once, Coraline!"
coraline,No.
other mother,  I'll give you to the count of three. One...
coraline,"Ow, what are you doing!"
coraline,"Ow, that hurts!"
coraline,  Who's there?
coraline,  You ... you mean the Other Mother? ...
boy ghost,  Don't remember our names... But I `member my true mommy...
coraline,Why are you all here?
all ghosts,The Beldam!
boy ghost,And saw that we weren't    happy.
boy ghost,Gave all that we asked -
boy ghost,"She said that she loved us,"
all ghosts,And ate up our lives.
coraline,"Well, she can't keep me in the dark forever; not if she wants to win my life. Beating her is my only chance."
coraline,"Has she taken those, too?"
boy ghost,"Find our eyes, mistress, and our souls will be freed."
coraline,I ... I'll try.
coraline,   WYBIE?..
other wybie,Shhh.

coraline,Oh... the Wybie that talks...
wybie,"Huh? Ha ha ha....yeah... Um, so you know tha-that old doll I gave you?"
coraline,"  You stole that doll, didn't you?"
coraline,"It used to look like this pioneer girl; then Huck Finn junior; then it was this Little Rascals chick with all these ribbons, and braids, and...."
wybie,"Uh, listen, I-I-I'm really not supposed  TO--"
coraline,She's in there.
wybie,C-can you  can you unlock it?
coraline,Not in a million years. But it wouldn't matter; she can't escape without her eyes. None of the ghosts can.
wybie,"Huhhhhhh... So, uh, I really need to get that doll?"
coraline,Great! I'd love to get rid of it!
coraline,"Where are you hiding, you little monster?!"

coraline,"NO! - the Other Mother! She's got this whole world where everything's better - the food, the garden, the--  --neighbors."

coraline,"You, you have a very funny way of showing it."
