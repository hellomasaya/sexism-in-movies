Speaker,Dialogue
snatcher, Wake his lordship.
snatcher, Boxtroll monsters have stolen a child.
lord portley-rind, No.
snatcher, They're no doubt picking their teeth with his adorable baby bones by now!
lord portley-rind,A horrible tragedy.  Let's deal with it in the morning!
lord portley-rind, My Gouda!?
snatcher, They'll stop at nothing.
lord portley-rind,You're the town exterminator. I'll pay whatever it takes.
snatcher,"Oh, I don't want money."
lord portley-rind,A White Hat? You?! Absurd!
snatcher,Alright then. But prepare to say bye bye to your Brie. Cheerio to your Cheddar. Goodbye to your...
lord portley-rind, Very well. Every boxtroll gone. With proof!
snatcher, For a white hat?
fish,Hmm...
shoe,Huh?
fish, Ohhhh...
snatcher,MR. GRISTLE!
snatcher,ACQUIRE THEM!
fish," ""Eggs?"""

shoe,Ahh!
fish,Oooo!
eggs, Oooh!
fish, Hide.
eggs, This way.
winnie, I'd better warn father.
lord portley-rind,"Settle down, men, settle down. Important town business to discuss. First on the docket: more complaints of crumbling bridges."
langsdale,Speaking of crumbling... is that a new blue cheese I see?
broderick,Does smell delicious.
lord portley-rind,I suppose we could do with a nibble first.
broderick,Mmm... Pungent...
langsdale,Complex...
broderick,I'm tasting notes of... plum!
lord portley-rind," All good fun, but we do have this school funding initiative to vote on. Been sitting here for months. All in favor of--"
broderick,--Cutting open the Roquefort next?
all,AYE!!
lord portley-rind,"Well, okay, okay. A quick reminder, tomorrow is Trubshaw Baby Remembrance Day.  And we all know what that means... a performance by Madame Frou Frou."
boulanger,A VISION!
broderick,Now there's a woman...
langsdale,... With some cheese on her bones!
lord portley-rind,"A lady like that is like a fine brie. Raw. Dangerous.  Maybe a little stinky, but one taste and you'll be begging for... mmm . . ."
lord portley-rind,WINIFRED!
winnie,But Father! I saw boxtrolls again!
lord portley-rind,Shoo. Shoo. Shoo.
winnie,They're right outside. They could come rip the flesh off my bones any moment!
lord portley-rind," Winifred, proper girls should not be obsessing over grotesque monsters."
winnie,I'm not obsessed! I just can't stop imagining them gnawing off my toes and stringing them together as a necklace! Father? Father.
lord portley-rind, Mmm hmm. Yes.
winnie," If they kidnapped me and slurped up my intestines like noodles, would you give up your white hat to save me?"
lord portley-rind," Hmm? Um. Yes, Winifred."
winnie,Father!
lord portley-rind,"What? Uh... White Hat? Right.  What.. Oh, seems to have been smudged by a bit of brie. Be a dear and have the butler give it a wash, would you?"
winnie,BUT--
winnie,I'll give your hat a wash all right.
winnie,Ha!
winnie,Who... who's there?
eggs,Boy?
snatcher,Hmm. Someone's out past curfew. Very dangerous.
winnie,I... I saw a boy.
snatcher,All I saw was filthy boxtroll monsters.
winnie,"I can escort myself, thank you."
snatcher,"Yes, how did this hat find itself aaaaall the way out here?"
winnie,"The... wind! Blew it, right out the window. Very windy tonight!"
snatcher,Hmmm. Must've died down. Suddenly!
winnie,There's no need to go inside.
snatcher,"Oh, but as a gentleman, I insist."
snatcher, Lord Portley-Rind!
winnie, Can I have the hat back now?
lord portley-rind,What in Gouda's name is going on? Archibald Snatcher?
snatcher,"Deepest apologies, your Lordship. But I found something out in the street that belongs to you."
lord portley-rind,My White Hat!
winnie,Huh?
lord portley-rind,"I'll take that... Now, now, Snatcher one doesn't acquire a white hat by simply--  --picking it up... off the street."
langsdale,With Valor!
boulanger,Chivalry!
broderick,Or being rich! That's how I got it.
snatcher,"Oh, don't I know it, sirs."
lord portley-rind,Um.. ehhh...
snatcher,"When I destroy every last boxtroll in this town, I shall earn my white hat... and join you in the Tasting Room."
lord portley-rind,Good lord.  Not sure who should be more terrified - the boxtrolls or us.
snatcher,I was told the wind had something to do with it.
lord portley-rind,"The wind, eh?"
winnie,"Father, I'm sorry--"
snatcher," Miss Portley-Rind, your Lordship, Sirs. I bid you good night. I'm sure we'll be seeing each other again very, very soon."
lord portley-rind, Hmmmm.. Winnie...
snatcher,Don't forget. I'm a size six-and-a- half. Order ahead.
winnie,"Father, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to. Well, at first I did, but I think this situation offers a great opportunity for a father and daughter to discuss their feelings--"
lord portley-rind, Not another word.
winnie,But Father I really-
lord portley-rind,Bed!
winnie,I did see a boy...
eggs,RUN!

winnie,The boxtroll exterminators? They live down on Curd's Way.
eggs,How do I get there?
winnie,Curds Way? Milk turns into it.
eggs,"It's not true, you know.  We don't eat babies!"
winnie,We? What do you mean we?
snatcher,... stooges  ... can choose to change their lives. Our dreams are in our grasp!
snatcher,YES!
snatcher,"Now, gentlemen. What better way to dream than to walk in the shoes of those to whom we aspire? Mr. Pickles, fetch the--"

snatcher,What?
snatcher, --With sssophissstication and sssavoir faire!
snatcher,Thisss is where I belong!
snatcher, Well not here! In this rotten factory!
snatcher,"In the tasting room, supping on the choicest cheeses... Everyone in town bowing down to me, like a gentleman, a lord with a white hat!"
eggs,Fish!

lord portley-rind,What is going on here?!
snatcher,I... I am befuddled as your lordship! I... I crushed them myself!
