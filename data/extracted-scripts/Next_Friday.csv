uncle elroy,"Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?"
craig,"Naw, it ain't like that."
uncle elroy,"If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson."
craig,"Alright, I'll remember that."
uncle elroy,"You know me?  I would've shot his big ass.  Hey, Willie, how's it going?  Still steppin' in dog shit every day?"
uncle elroy,"Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?"
craig,I'll remember.
uncle elroy,"Send Betty my love.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you."
craig,"Thanks, Unc."
craig,"I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat."
craig,"I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch."
craig,Who is that?
craig,They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
craig,This you?
craig,Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
craig,"This my baby.  I feel like a new nigga in this car.  I get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus."
craig,Excuse me?
craig,"Yeah, I'm 'bout it."
craig,What kind of activity?
craig,Nice to meet you?
craig,"Man, this a cool house."
craig,Yeah.
craig,"Oh, yeah, where you work at?"
craig,Thanks for reminding me.
uncle elroy,"Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig."
suga,"Oooh, ba-by!"
craig,Thank you.
suga," You know, I'mma be your new auntie.  We can keep it all in the family if you want to."
uncle elroy,"Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes."
suga, Elroy.
uncle elroy,Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
suga,"Okay.  Bye, Craig."
craig,Nice to meet you.
uncle elroy,"Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  But check this out.  I got to lay some ground rules.  Your my family and I love you.  You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking?"
craig,Yeah.
uncle elroy,"Well, let me in."
craig,"Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?"
uncle elroy,"Oh, that's D'Wana.  His ex.  Day-Day, the crazy bitch is back!"
craig,"Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving."
craig,"I know, be still."
uncle elroy,"Boy, you got you a little fatal attraction, huh?  I had two or three of them in my day."
craig,That's too much water.
uncle elroy,Help him to his feet.  Let's get him to the bathroom.
uncle elroy,"Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes."
uncle elroy,"Yeah, 20 minutes.  Trust me.  I've been pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes."
uncle elroy,"Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house."
craig,You paid cash?
uncle elroy,Cash money.  They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  That's for suckas.  They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago.  I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
craig,"It's cool, but where's the water?"
uncle elroy,Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
craig,Y'all never use it?
uncle elroy,"Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though."
craig,"That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either."
uncle elroy,Good.
ezal,I be damned.
debo,Where did Craig move to?

craig,You want us to give you a ride?
karla,I don't know.
craig,"What you mean, you don't know?  Just wait here."
karla,"Cheeco, no!"
joker,Get yo dumb ass in the back.
craig,Why not?  She was cool with it.
craig,"What you mean, so?"
uncle elroy,"Nephew, you got perfect timing..."
suga," Come on, Craig.  Sit down right here."
uncle elroy,"I know you smoke weed, right?"
craig,Why you say that?
uncle elroy,'Cause your lips is getting black.
suga,"Would you like a glass of wine, baby?"
craig,No thank you. It's too early.
uncle elroy,"Boy, I can roll a blunt better than them bitches in Havana.  I know Willie don't let'cha smoke in the house, but I'm ya uncle.  I don't care how high you get in my house.  Long as you let me hit it..."
suga,"Fire it up, Roy."
uncle elroy,"Now I'mma show you the real ""Puff Daddy."""
craig,Suga.
uncle elroy,"Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?"
craig, I don't know!
uncle elroy,Suga!
suga, Huh?
uncle elroy,What you doing to my nephew?
suga," Craig, what are you doing to me?"
craig,"I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember."
uncle elroy,"Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby."
suga,Mr. Nasty time?
uncle elroy,"Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl."
suga,"Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here."
uncle elroy,Make yourself at home.
craig,Hold on.
craig,I said hold on!
craig,Can I help you?
delivery guy,Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
craig,I don't play for no team.
delivery guy,"Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?"
craig," Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?"
delivery guy,"Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery."
craig,What is it?
delivery guy,"Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course."
craig,Oh damn.
craig, Uncle Elroy...Uncle Elroy?
uncle elroy," Come on here, Suga..."
craig,"Naw, naw!  Unc, wake up!  It's me!  Wake up!"
suga," Ohhh, baby!"
ezal,"We gotta stop or something, man.  My ass is hurting.  This handlebar is hard."
debo,Shut up!  He still eats here every day!
debo,Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
ezal,What urgent message?
debo,"If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call."
ezal,That ain't gonna work.
debo,Just do it.
ezal,I don't know the number.
debo,"It's on the outside of the building, now pick the phone up!"
ezal,"Hello...Yeah, I got an urgent message for a nigga named Mr. Willie Jones."
debo,William.
ezal,"Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call."
debo,Let's go.
ezal,You too big.
debo,Keep pushing.

craig,I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
roach, I do.
roach," Sorry, dude."
craig,You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.

craig,Wait.  Check'em out.
baby joker,Get down.
craig,You see that?
roach,Me neither.
craig,It's something in that hydraulic pump.
craig,Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
craig,"I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look."
roach,I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
craig,Could be.  Rather be crazy than homeless. Now all we need is a big pack of baloney.
both,Baloney??
karla,I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
joker,I'll take you later.
karla,When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
joker,Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
craig,"It's about to work, just come on."
roach, What about the dog?
craig,That's what the baloney's for!
craig,What's the B-G's?
roach,"Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together."
craig,"Look, Day-Day.  If we don't go over there and take a look, this might be the last night you got a home.  Now trust me."
craig,"It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look."
roach,"Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along."
craig,Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
roach,"Fuck, what's his name?"

roach," Here, Cheeco.  Chee-co, here boy.  That's a good boy."
craig,"Come on, he should have'em by now."
craig,You go first.
craig,You go first.
craig,"Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over."
craig,What?
craig,Me too.
roach,My baloney has a first name.  It's C-h-e- e-c-o.
craig,Wait.
craig,He's still over by Roach.
baby joker,Want me to take a look?
joker,"No, keep working."
joker,Close the door.
joker,"Alright, put it in that drawer."
craig,"That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it."
craig,"No, man, just wait."
roach,Good boy.  Nice dog.
roach,"No lungs, baby.  No lungs."
joker,Fuck that.
joker,I don't want no doors locked around here. You hear me?
joker," Good, 'cause that's how you gonna get it."
karla,What are you doing?
craig,Huh?
karla,What are you doing here?
craig,"I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life."
karla,What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
craig,Yes I did.  Excuse me.
karla,Nobody.
karla,No you didn't.  Get out my room.  Go back down to your little girlfriends.
roach,"...like I was saying.  A guy like me, and a dog like you, don't need this bullshit. We need to be in Maui renting jet ski to fat funks in flower shirts.  You feel me, C?"
roach,Where's Craig?
roach,Why did he go in the house?
karla,You did all this for me?
craig,Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
karla,Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
craig,Why didn't she put'em out?
karla,"Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us."
craig,I'm sorry to hear that.
karla,I thought you came up here to see me.
craig,I did.  Is that door locked?
karla,It's locked.
craig,Make sure.
karla,"You so nervous, I already locked this door."
craig,I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
karla, So what?  Let's make'em wait.
craig,I be damn.
roach,Go for it.
roach,This is a knock.
joker,You fuckin' lover boys hear that?
baby joker,Hear what?
joker,Don't fuckin' move.
joker,What the fuck you want?
joker,What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
roach,"Hold on.  A man, you broke my fuckin' board and I don't appreciate it."
uncle elroy,"I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!"
uncle elroy,"Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!"
uncle elroy,"I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them."
karla,"Next time, page me first."
craig,Okay.
karla,You alright?
craig,"Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later."
roach,And some rolling papers.
girls,Fine.
roach, Hey.
joker,Shut up!  Both of you right now!
joker,I don't believe this sugar shit. Something ain't right.
joker,Keep your mouth shut.
karla,"Hey, what's going on?"
joker,Nothing.  What you want?
karla,Are you going to take me to see Mom?
joker,Take your car.
karla,'Take your car?'
joker,"Yeah, and hurry up."
karla,Okay.
joker,"If everything's alright.  We might let you leave, too."
uncle elroy,"Craig, where the hell you been?"
craig,Have you seen Day-Day?
uncle elroy,No.  Thought he was with you.
craig,"Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help."
baby joker, Some of the money is missing.
joker, What?!?!
roach,I don't know.
joker,It means you Miyateas are staying with us.  You know what to do.
craig,You see that?
uncle elroy,"Me, too.  You think they're in there?"
craig,Yup.
craig,It's a long story.  Right now we gotta do somethin'.
uncle elroy,"Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes."
suga,"If ya'll don't come back not in ten minutes, I'mma callin' the po'lice."
uncle elroy,Wait a minute.  I gotta go get my shit.
joker,Shut the fuck up!
roach,"Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday."
joker,"I'm hearing a lot of talking, but I'm not hearing the right words."
baby joker,Maybe the other guy took it.
joker, Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
craig,That's a nice piece of heat right there.
uncle elroy,"Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing."
craig,Come on.
uncle elroy,What about that ugly dog?
craig,"He's on the other side, sleep."
uncle elroy,Shut yo' ass up.
craig,"I'm not sure, but I think they're in this room."
joker,Tape his mouth shut.
roach,"Yeah, brown and white relations, too."
joker,"I'm sick and tired of bullshitting with you guys.  Baby brother, go get the chainsaw."

uncle elroy,Don't move me.
joker,Where are these fucking guys?
joker,What you doing here?
uncle elroy,"I lost something, nigga.  What it look like?"
joker,Looks like a dead man.
uncle elroy,"Boy, Day-Day, I'mma kick yo' ass for getting me into this mess and hurting my back!  I moved out here to get away from this kinda shit!"
roach,Bite his ear!
uncle elroy,What 'em!  Watch 'em!
craig,Ya'll mothafuckas help me!
joker, Say hello to my little friend.
debo,"No way, Jose.  This one is mine."
roach,"He's a boy, dude."
ezal,"Mr. Jones, we was just playin'.  He made me do it."
uncle elroy,Wait a minute!  I live across the street!
sheriff lady,You do?
uncle elroy,Yeah.  Paid cash.
uncle elroy,"When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day."
uncle elroy,"Sorry, my ass."

uncle elroy,"I threw my back, again."
suga,"Aw, no lovin' tonight?"
uncle elroy,"Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight."
suga,"Come on, baby, let's go in the house."
uncle elroy,For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
roach,"Don't worry, bro, you, Suga, Day-Day and Craig can live with me and my parents. 'Til you get back on yo' feet."
