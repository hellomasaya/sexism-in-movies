Speaker,Dialogue
cut to:,He pulls open the drawer again - the pornography collection.
nick's pov,"of the room shaking, accompanied by his heavy breathing. His eyes float from the Hustler to the pink walls of his room."
estelle,Jerry? Where did that car come from? Jerry looks over his shoulder and they all take a moment to appreciate the slab-sided Lincoln in the drive.
jerry,It's a '62 Lincoln convertible. Like the one Kennedy was shot in.
nick,Except his was black and yours is white. And dirty.
jerry,See that. I was going to take you and your mom for a spin after breakfast. But now I guess it'll just be her and me. You have your smart mouth to thank for that.
nick,Damn it. I guess I'll just have to hang out all alone at the book depository.
jerry,The what?
estelle,"Jerry, I don't understand. What happened to the Chevy-Nova?"
jerry,"Sold it to a sailor on the Alameda Naval Air Base. A man should never own a car for more than three months, Estelle. That way he always gets the thrill of owning a new automobile! Jerry smiles with cretin pride. Nick looks to his mother and disturbingly enough, she seems turned on by his car-owner savvy."
nick,He just left. What's up?
nick,"Well, I think he used that nine hundred dollars to buy his Lincoln. He's giving my mom a joyride in it now. But he'll be back this afternoon, so I would come back then. He's pretty stubborn. You might have to beat it out of him."
nick,"I like it. Very to the point. Well... See you guys this afternoon! The sailors nod, somewhat perplexed by this kid's demeanor. As they turn to go and Nick closes the door..."
lefty,My sister said she saw Millie Filbert holding hands with some college guy.
nick,"I dunno, Lefty. I think your sister is just waging psychological warfare."
lefty,"Well it's working. What am I gonna do, Nick? I'm obsessed. I think about Millie so much my balls ache."
nick,"Maybe your just not wacking off enough. As if in response, Lefty passes the binoculars off to Nick and then turns over onto his back and unzips his pants. As Lefty jerks it, Nick looks with nonchalance..."
nick,Why don't you just have your parents take you to the dick doctor?
nick,"Still, you might want to get it fixed before asking Millie out."
jerry,"Nick, you little shit, get down here! Jerry hollers from the kitchen where Estelle gapes out the window. Nick calmly joins them from upstairs."
estelle,"Nick, do you know anything about this? She points out the window and they all take in the Chevy and the sailors' oh-so-subtle note on the hood."
nick,"Oh, yeah. Those sailors came by. They want their money back. I guess there was a banana in the transmission."
jerry,You tell them when I was coming back?
nick,Now why would I do that? Jerry seeths inwardly at Nick's mock innocence.
estelle,"What are you going to do, Jerry?"
jerry,I think I'll go get the Lincoln washed.
estelle,You're leaving? What happens when the sailor comes back for his nine- hundred dollars?
jerry,Just tell him he bought the car with my standard guarantee. Thirty days or thirty feet. Whichever comes first. I'm in the right. And on cue comes the ring of the doorbell and the simultaneous pounding of angry Navy fists on the back door. They peer out the window and find the fleet on the front steps.
nick,"Oh, look. The sailors are here. Jerry first starts to dart one way and then another, searching for a hiding space as he hisses."
jerry,Get rid of them! And then the front door gets kicked open and a mob of sailors pour in. Jerry flees. A HANDHELD CAM chase as he heads for the back and is cut off by the sailors coming in. Jerry bolts up the stairs.
nick,"Jerry, where are you going? Just tell them you are in the right."
jerry,That's my life savings! One of the sailors pokes Jerry in the gut hard and he whimpers.
estelle,"Don't hurt him! Nick, call 911!"
jerry,"Please. Please don't hurt me. It's all I got, guys. I swear. Take the Lincoln!"
nick,"Eight hundred and thirty seven, actually."
jerry,"Wow, those guys are even dumber than I thought. They actually think I'm stupid enough to let them muscle me into paying."
estelle,"Jerry, what are you talking about? We need to call the police!"
jerry,I'm not some tattle-tale like your son. Nick rolls his eyes.
estelle,"Then for God's sake, Jerry, just sell the Lincoln and pay them!"
jerry,Can't. It's in The Code.
estelle,What code? The vehicular code?
jerry,"Code of the streets, Babe. Code of the streets."
estelle,Then what are you planning to do? Jerry takes a seat at the kitchen table and adopts The Thinker pose. He strokes his chin as Nick and Estelle await his brilliant solution with breathless anticipation.
estelle,"Goodbye, everyone! We're going on vacation!"
jerry,Let's blow!
estelle,"Jerry...? You said it was a cabin. In the back, Nick removes his sunglasses to regard the long, green, turd of a trailer. Some concrete dwarves in the grass. A dusty canvas awning over a small cement patio. A decrepit picket fence with a sign that reads: MY GREEN HAVEN. Estelle looks as if she's about to cry. Jerry puts his arm around her."
jerry,C'mon Estelle. It's real cute on the inside.
jerry,I say the kid does the dishes and we retire to the master bedroom. Jerry pushes out and disappears into the back. Nick watches him with loathing. Estelle smiles apologetically.
nick,Mom? Do you really like Jerry? Her smile fades.
estelle,"Nick, how   many men do you think there are   who'd be interested in a forty-one   year old woman with two brats, no   money, and stretch marks? And with that she excuses herself, leaving Nick to ponder.  NICK  It's your neighbor, Mrs. Saunders. Church services begin at seven fifteen prompt. Donuts will be served. Nick glances down at the morning wood elevating his boxers. Mrs. Saunders narrows her eyes at Nick through the screen door and takes off.  EXT. MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY  Nick steps out of the trailer in a bathrobe, toiletries in one hand, towel in the other. He heads off down the wooded path.  EXT. WOODS - DAY  The serene melodies of rousing HYMNS float from the well- attended congregation in the meeting hall. WE TRACK across the trees as Nick makes his way down the path. He slows to observe the sun coming through the canopy overhead. He glances off the path and comes to a sudden stop. A grape arbor flanked by Corinthian columns set against the blue of Clear Lake. A chestnut haired SHEENI SAUNDERS stands facing the water, her head tilted down to read the book in her hands. The wind coming off the lake blows her dress just enough to give a hint of the shapely thighs underneath."
sheeni,"Your robe is open. Nick looks down. He pulls the robe closed, scowls, and goes into a flustered march down the path."
sheeni,"Hel-lo, Excitable Boy."
estelle,"Nick, honey, meet Sheeni Saunders."
nick,Hello.
estelle,Sheeni needs to go to the grocery store. I've offered her your help in carrying her bags. Nick regards Sheeni and her mischievous smirk.
nick,Thanks a pantsful.
nick,You don't have to go to services?
sheeni,"No. Much to the consternation of my fanatical parents I have converted to atheism. Fortunately my brother, Paul, paved the way for such transgressions."
nick,Paul is an atheist too?
sheeni,"Buddhist, I believe, though we have not seen him in some time. I myself am looking forward to being free of parental bondage."
nick,Likewise.
sheeni,"Well, your mother seems very nice, though your father I think might be rather dim."
nick,Jerry and I share no blood links of any kind. As they pass the meeting hall there comes a surge of HYMNS in chorus.
nick,Sounds rather zealous.
sheeni,"Yes, even though I am no longer a believer I always found the services wonderfully aerobic."
nick,You could say the same thing about sex. Sheeni stops. She looks at Nick intently.
sheeni,"Nick, are you going to turn out like all the other young men and have nothing on your mind except carnal pleasures?"
nick,I hardly ever think about sex.
sheeni,"Really? I think about it all the time. It's the hormones at work, you know. She resumes walking. Nick follows her with confusion."
nick,Wow. A second floor.
sheeni,"Yes. Father bought it so that he could look down upon the world. For him, Christian humility has always been a struggle. Sheeni relieves him of the watermelon."
sheeni,"Well, it was nice to meet you, Nick. She trudges down the slate path to the home."
nick,Sheeni? Do you want to come to the beach with me? She turns around. Gives a little smirk.
sheeni,"What a thoughtful invitation. I'd love to, Nick. Wait for me in the living room."
sheeni,Back in a moment.
nick,"Er, yes, Mr. Saunders."
sheeni,"Let's go, Nick. Bye, Father."
sheeni,Would you mind applying this to my exposed areas?
nick,Not at all.
sheeni,"My, you get turned on easily. Nick's hands freeze."
sheeni,"Oh, don't stop, Nick. We all have our hormones to deal with. Girls are fortunate in that it doesn't show. For all the world knows, my vagina could be moist with desire as we speak."
nick,Is it?
sheeni,"That's none of your business, I'm sure. Shall you do my front too?"
nick,"I'm up for it. She rolls over onto her back, her young breasts straining up against the yellow spandex."
sheeni,"I hope you don't find it too stimulating, Nick."
nick,"I'm coping. He starts in on her flawless legs, gliding on the oil all the way within a finger's reach of her sweet apex. With each daring pass, he comes closer to that final split. Finally the hand swerves too late, and lightly grazes the softly yielding vee."
sheeni,"Uh, Nick. Maybe you better do the top now. Nick moves up, lubricating her arms, shoulders and neck. He smooths the oil on the soft undulating foothills."
sheeni,"Thanks, Nick."
sheeni,"Breathless is one of my favorite films, though it might be eclipsed by Rebel Without a Cause. I often wonder what American cinema would be like today had Dean done more than three. Nick nods, and for a beat they trek on in silence. He glances down at her hand and fumbles for it with his own."
sheeni,"Oh, Nick. You seem very nice. But in fairness, I should tell you that I have a boyfriend. Nick becomes sickeningly pale."
nick,What's his name?
sheeni,Trent Preston.
nick,What's he like?
sheeni,"Seventeen years of age, six-two, fluent in French, plays the piano, a champion swimmer, and writes Futurist Percussive poetry. They stop at the gate to the Saunders' home."
nick,I'm not familiar with Futurist Percussive poems.
sheeni,I could recite one of Trent's if you'd like.
nick,Please do. She takes a dramatic pause.
sheeni,"RamDam 12/ Sizzle mop/ Crunch down/ Safety net/ Hot! Hot! Hot!/ Void. She gives a slightly amused smile at Nick's blank expression.  NICK  3 AM. I decide I am too chicken for any of the manly, violent means of suicide. I shall swallow sleeping pills. Where to get them, though?"
nick,Good morning!
sheeni,Nick? God what time is it?
nick,Seven o'clock. How about breakfast?
sheeni, Come back in two hours. I'm going on a hike. You can join me if you'd like. She closes the door.
sheeni,"Nick, where are your hiking boots, water bottle, provisions, survey maps and compass?"
nick,Like John Muir I enter the wilderness with nothing more than my journal and a childlike sense of wonder.
sheeni,"Okay, but I have no plans to baby any slackers."
nick,Quite a drop.
sheeni,"Yes. Not to be morbid, but this sight has been the chosen means of at least three teen suicides."
nick,Huh. Quite a hike just to end your life.
sheeni,"Well, there is a road. But I agree. Adolescents have a tendency toward the over-dramatic. Sheeni backs away. Nick stays, staring over the edge."
nick,That's my journal!
sheeni,"Don't get so upset Nick. Though your handwriting is egregious, you have a fairly decent vocabulary. Although, Trent is not an ""affected twit."" Nick snatches the journal out of her hands."
nick,Those are my private thoughts and are none of your business!
sheeni,Nick?
nick,What?
sheeni,"The lengths you say you are willing to go to to win my heart, the contemplation of suicide at the thought of not having me...  It all evokes a strong emotional warmth in my breast. Nick can only stare at her sprawled out on her back as if posing for a centerfold."
sheeni,"Did you mean it, Nickie? A beat as he is lost in the ocean of her gaze before he manages to gain his senses."
nick,How would you like it if I read your journal?
sheeni,You can read it if you'd like.
nick,It's in French.
sheeni,A necessity for a child in a household with prying Christian parents.
nick,What does it say?
sheeni,"Wouldn't you like to know. That last passage would be of particular interest to you. Nick leaps on top of her, grabbing her thin wrists. She squeals and giggles."
nick,Spill it! I demand full disclosure!
sheeni,"Never! They wrestle, perspiring, squirming bodies brushing together. Flashing super:        Thundering Erection They pause. He's got her arms pinned. She's on her back. He hovers above her."
sheeni, Nickie's got a hard-on. Nick considers her expression.
sheeni,"You're still a virgin, I can tell. Maybe that's why I like you. A beat. She looks at him expectantly. Nick is at a loss."
sheeni,"Kiss me, you wienie. Nick tentatively approaches her luscious mouth. Their noses dodge successfully and their lips meet. After a long moment, they break it off. Staring into each other's eyes. Sheeni jumps up."
sheeni,"Okay, lover. Break's over. Let's go! Nick lays in the grass a moment, watching after her."
nick,When can I see you again?
sheeni,Get up early tomorrow and you can shower with me in the ladies room. Five minutes to six. If you dare. Nick grins with excitement.
estelle,So what's this Sheeni girl like?
nick,She's the Encyclopedia Britannica.
jerry,She's got a nice rack.
estelle,"Jerry! Jerry chuckles. Nick stares at him, perhaps resolving to murder the trucker in his sleep."
sheeni,"Get out quick! Still wearing her robe, she dives into the spray to save her mother. Nick grabs his robe and retreats."
nick,Should I go to the sheriff's now?
sheeni,No. I managed to convince Mother you were retarded and couldn't read the sign.
nick,"Say, where were you anyway?   We said five minutes to six."
sheeni,"I'm sorry. But, Nick, women are always discreetly late. It's expected of us."
nick,Swell. And the punctual guy fries in the chair for rape.
sheeni,Don't complain. At least you got to shower with a naked woman.  What are your plans today?
nick,My parents want to go to Middletown. Jerry has the moronic notion of buying a trailer there before we leave.
sheeni,"I should like to come with you, Nick. The more time we spend together the better. I fear when you leave we might never see each other again. Nick nods glumly. Clearly a devastating thought."
jerry,What's your cash price?
geezer,I said in the ad. Thousand dollars firm.
jerry,"Thousand, huh? That must be with a guarantee."
geezer,"As is, where she is."
jerry,I don't know. Those rusty propane tanks are a fire hazard. The roof probably needs work. I couldn't go above eight hundred. The geezer ponders the bad news. Estelle shakes her head and goes inside the RV to inspect.
geezer,I might take nine fifty.
jerry,Nine hundred. Sheeni lets out a squeal of delight. They all turn their attention to where she has discovered a box full of squirming
sheeni,"Look, Nick! She shows him the ugly little pug. Short droopy ears, a tiny, batlike face."
nick,Great.
sheeni, How much?
geezer,Ten dollars. Sheeni turns to Nick pleadingly. Nick fishes through his wallet.
nick,All I have is a Subway card with four stickers.
geezer,Sold.
nick,No doubt close to the dog's actual value.
sheeni,"Oh, thank you, Nickie! She plants a kiss on his lips and promptly turns her attention to the dog, who licks her face affectionately. Nick looks on with appropriate jealousy."
sheeni,I'm going to name him Albert. 
geezer,That don't sound like any kind of name for a dog.
sheeni," I'll have you know I've named him after the deceased French writer, Albert Camus. Author of L'Etranger and other works of existential brilliance. The geezer looks to Nick with an expression of ""I stand corrected."" Nick returns with a nod that says ""You have no idea."""
nick,"Sheeni, I think I love you."
sheeni,"Well, your hormones certainly do. And oddly enough, my hormones like you too."
nick,Sheeni? It's... It's okay. We can visit each other when I get a drivers license.
sheeni,"I hope that's true, but.. It's not that. It's..."
nick,What?
sheeni,It's my parents. They're... I fear they will never allow me to keep Albert.
nick,Oh. Nick tries to hide his hurt. Picks up the paper with annoyance.
nick,No way.
sheeni,"At least you could consider it, honey. For me. I've never asked you for anything before."
nick,"Maybe I could take him, but I'd have certain conditions. I would have to be the only dad on the scene.  Trent would have to go."
sheeni,That's asking a lot. Trent worships the ground I walk on.
nick,"It's your choice. Life with me and the dog you love. Or a pet-free existence with a shallow, egotistical poet."
sheeni,"OK, Nick, I guess I don't have any choice. I'll break up with Trent. But if he kills himself it's on your conscience."
nick,I accept full responsibility.
sheeni,"Well, good, that's settled."
nick,"Not quite, darling. I want one more thing."
sheeni,What?
nick,What do you think? A beat. Sheeni looks pensive. It fades to amusement.
sheeni,Do you have a condom? Nick lifts his eyebrows. Now we're getting somewhere!
sheeni,"It has to be in a safe place. A nice comfortable bed. With no threat of interruptions. And for relaxation and mood setting some good red wine, preferably French. I want a new condom. Not one that's been riding around in your wallet for years. Consumers rated them a while back. I suggest you get their top-rated brand. This may take some research in the library. I'd appreciate a photocopy of the article. Plus, for supplementary protection, I want a name brand spermicide."
nick,How about I have a quick vasectomy just to be on the safe side?
sheeni," Well, Nick, that, of course, is up to you."
estelle,"Nick, honey, say goodbye to Sheeni. It's time to hit the road. Nick watches Sheeni kiss Albert. He looks less than enthused at the thought of sloppy-seconds. Finally Sheeni hands Nick the dog. Nick and Sheeni stand there an awkward beat. Sheeni leans in and gives him a peck on the cheek."
sheeni," Don't forget, darling. Red wine and Consumer Reports. She smiles. They're the sexiest words Nick's ever heard. He grabs her and kisses her deeply. Jerry HONKS the horn and they break off."
jerry,"Okay. Back to civilization! He fires up the Lincoln and they kick up dust. Albert slobbers all over Nick. Nick sets him down and watches Sheeni in the side-mirror, waving in the road."
jerry,"You see that, Babe. They caved."
nick,I guess they didn't cave after all. Jerry pops the hood and lets out a whistle.
jerry,"Boy, everything's complete. There's even water in the windshield washer."
estelle,How did they ever get it in here? My front door can't be more than three feet wide.
jerry,Looks like they brought it in piece by piece and then reassembled it.
estelle,But it would take an army of mechanics to do all that! Jerry slams down the hood.
jerry,"Or a navy, Babe. Or a navy."
estelle,"Nick, your sister came all the way from LA for a weekend visit! Nick and Joanie meet eyes. She lifts a quizzical eyebrow."
nick,Stellar.
jerry,Can someone do something about the mutt? The family dines over take-out fried chicken. Jerry kicks Albert and the puppy goes tumbling across the floor.
estelle,"I don't know, Jerry. Can someone do something about the monstrosity dripping oil in my living room?"
joanie,"Yeah, I noticed that. What's the story?"
nick,"Jerry tried to outsmart a few sailors. It's been an amusing saga. Jerry contemplates smacking Nick upside the head, but decides against it when he discerns Estelle is probably in her son's corner."
jerry,"OK, Babe, I guess when I come back from my next haul I'll just have to take it apart piece by piece."
joanie,"Up to anything scandalous these days, Nick?"
nick,I was going to ask you the same thing.
joanie,What do you mean? Nick puffs out his chest. Joanie looks down at her boob-job.
joanie,"Not that it's any of your business, but I've taken a class to improve my posture. Nick rolls his eyes."
estelle,I think Joanie looks very nice. And she has a new boyfriend too.
nick,Did you meet him in posture class?
estelle,Nick met a nice girl in Ukiah.
joanie,Really now? Are you on each others' Myspace pages?
nick,Hardly. Sheeni believes the internet will be the end of literacy.
joanie,"So it's to be a torturous snail mail exchange, huh?"
nick,More like the occassional collect call.
estelle,Collect calls? And just who do you expect to pay for that? Jerry kicks the dog away from his sock. Albert growls and prepares for another charge.
jerry,"Hey, Nick. Want to learn how a car is put together?"
nick,"No, thanks. Auto mechanics doesn't interest me."
jerry,"See, Estelle, I told you the kid was queer-eeAAAAHHHHH! Jerry lurches backward in the chair and lands on the floor, revealing that Albert's teeth have a firm grasp on Jerry's sack. The dog shakes the scrotum in his jaws."
jerry,"Damn it! The dog! He tries to swipe Albert with his beer bottle, but the dog retreats into the house, leaving Jerry rolling around on the floor. Joanie and Nick exchange a smile. The phone rings. Estelle gets up to answer it."
estelle,"Nick, put the dog in the basement."
estelle,"Nick, that was your father on the phone. He lost his job."
nick,How unlike him.
estelle,Watch your smart mouth. This means the end of child support.
nick,Which means...
estelle,You'll have to start going to...
nick,Hello?
nick,"Absolutely. Nick looks around, opens the door to the linen closet and darts inside."
nick,Sheeni? How are you?
nick,And how is Trent? Not too suicidal I hope.
sheeni,"Of course, he was disconsolate, but we talked all day and he's come to see this as an opportunity for growth. Oh, and Nick, Trent wanted me to tell you that he bears you no ill will."
nick,Nor I him. I wish him all the best.
sheeni,His parents are sending him to a French speaking boarding school this year. He's sure to get along there. So how is my darling Albert?
nick,"Well, though he's taken a disliking to Jerry."
sheeni,"And you, Nickie? How are you?"
nick,"I regret, Love of My Life, my father has lost his job and I will now be forced to go to public school."
sheeni,How unfortunate. What did he do?
nick,He's a writer - sort of. He writes advertising copy.
sheeni,"Really?  Nick, I suggest we look at your father's firing as a blessing in disguise."
nick,How so?
sheeni,I propose we get your father a job here in Ukiah and you can come and live with him.
nick,"Brilliant. Not that I'm fond of Ukiah, but I'd live in a drainage culvert to be with you."
sheeni,"Oh, Nickie. Now, I happen to know Progressive Plywood is looking for an assistant editor. It would be perfect for your father. Nick furrows his brow with skepticism."
nick,I had no idea you had knowledge of the employment opportunities of trade magazines.
sheeni,The owner is the father of a friend of mine.
nick,Anyone I know?
sheeni,"Okay, it's Trent's father. So what?"
nick,So why would Trent want to help my father move to Ukiah?
sheeni,"I told you, darling. Trent harbors you no ill will. I will have him call your father up pretending to be a head hunter."
nick,"Very well, but I don't see how I am to live with him. My mother values my indentured servitude."
sheeni,You must influence her to send you away. I feel this will require being in a constant state of open revolt on your part.
nick,What do you want me to do?
sheeni,I propose you rent the film Rebel Without a Cause as soon as possible. You must emulate James Dean... CLOSE ON her GLOSSY LIPS.
sheeni,"...You must be bad, Nickie. Be very, very bad. A glint of resolve in Nick's eyes."
nick,"I will, darling. I will! And in pre-lap comes the DING DONG of the doorbell."
estelle,"Kids? This is Officer Lance Wescott. He has some bad news. After a beat, Nick rolls down the window."
lance,"Your mother's friend Jerry had a heart attack in a bar in Dallas. He's dead. Estelle sobs, but isn't joined by her children. She turns to Lance."
estelle,Will they be sending his belongings?
lance,Uh... I'm afraid they've already been sent. To his wife. Beat. Nick looks to Joanie. They both look to their mother.
estelle,His... His wife?!? She bursts into tears and collapses into Officer Lance Wescott's arms.
lance,"There, there, Ma'am. It's going to be okay. Nick watches his mother sobbing against the cop's chest for a beat before he rolls up the window and he and Joanie resume watching the movie. Estelle's cries of despair become..."
nick,"Hello, Franois. I think you'll do nicely."
franois,"Oui, I am ze perfect match pour une Francophile for ze likes of Sheeni Saunders. I have ze calculating intelligence..."
nick,...the itchy trigger finger... Franois cocks the machine-gun.
nick,Damn! Those hippos are taking a shower together. How repulsive! He slams the door.
albert's pov,as we lunge at Lance's crotch.
nick,Where's Joanie?
estelle,She's sleeping in.
nick,"No doubt. I don't think anyone got a wink last night with all that racket. Lance looks at him, seething inwardly. He glances to Estelle."
nick,I thought there were laws in this city against illicit cohabitation. Or are they just another big policeman's joke?
lance,"Kid, you are asking for trouble."
nick,What are you going to do? Shoot me with your gun? Lance lunges across the table.
estelle,"No, Lance! Nickie, go to your room. Nick flings down his napkin and heads for the front door."
estelle,Where do you think you're going?
nick,Out! The screen door slams behind him.
estelle,What the in God's name has gotten into you?!? Jerry paid good money for that trailer!
nick,And just what makes you so sure it was me?
estelle,"Who the hell else would write such a thing? Estelle gestures to the trailer, which we can see has been defaced with the words GOD'S PERFECT ASSHOLE."
estelle,And just how do you explain this? She holds up a semi-nude Polaroid of Lacey.
nick,That's Lacey.
estelle,And just who the hell is Lacey?
nick,"Dad's girlfriend. Estelle stares at the photo, face contorted by revulsion and envy."
estelle,His girlfriend? What are you doing with a picture like this of your father's girlfriend?
joanie,"C'mon, Mom, all boys his age have pictures like that to..."
estelle,"When I want your opinion on raising my child, I'll ask for it. (to Nick; morbidly"
nick,"Well, she likes fast cars and takes a lot of naps with dad. Super:             "
nick,She likes to sit on Dad's lap while he eats and blow in his ear. Super:           
nick,"And she calls him ""Thunder Rod"" and he calls her ""Sugar Puss."" Super:        At this point Estelle has turned bright red."
estelle,"You are confined to your room until school starts, you sick pervert. She stalks off. Joanie glances over at Nick with amusement."
nick,I wish I was leaving with you tonight.
joanie,"Your day will come. I never thought mine would, but it did. Was all that stuff about Lacey and Dad made up?"
nick,I wish. Did you really take a posture class?
joanie,Implants. I wanted them all my life.
nick,"Hey, Lefty."
lefty,"What's with your mom, Nick? She gave me the third degree just to come up here."
nick,I vandalized Jerry's trailer and she found my picture of Lacey.
lefty,"Well, good thing I stole this from the bookstore then. Lefty unzips his backpack and produces a large hardbound volume titled Lovemaking for Advanced Gourmets."
lefty,"I was reading it all last night. Boy, having sex is a lot more complicated than I thought. Did you know you were supposed to stick your pinkie in her bumhole?"
nick,You lie.
lefty,"No way, man. Here, I got the page marked. Lefty flops down on the sofa next to Nick and the two of them flip through the manual."
nick,"Yeah, but I'm not sure I should try this on Sheeni. I think this book is for people who've been married so long they're disgusted by the sight of each other. They regard the illustrated figures of men and women in various states of foreplay."
lefty,Are we really supposed to be that... uh... big?
nick,I think these illustrations are disproportionate for emphasis.
lefty,Maybe we should compare.
nick,"Perhaps we should. Just for the sake of research. Nick and Lefty get to their feet and stand opposite each other like a pair of duelists. They simultaneously undo their belts and pull their pants and underwear to their feet. They straighten. Lefty's eyes fall to Nick's crotch. He gets a hint of concern in his expression. Nick stares at Lefty's, tilting his head to compensate for the curvature. The door behind them opens and Estelle appears toting Nick's lunch. She lets out a scream. The boys turn to face her, pants around their ankles."
estelle,"You won't get away! I'm calling your parents! PERVERTS! Nick bursts from the room, desperately trying to buckle his pants. Estelle is hot on his heels, wielding the hardbound sex manual as they round the bannister."
estelle,In my house! How dare you! She catches up to Nick at the top of the stairs and cracks him upside the head.
estelle,"Nick, I just want you to know that I've thought about it, and I've accepted that you are gay."
nick,"Thanks a pantsful, but I'm not gay. If you're really concerned though, I suggest you get me a room at the Ukiah Motel 6. If anyone can straighten me out, it's Sheeni. She looks at him dubiously and hands out the phone."
estelle,"That sounds more like a job for your father. Here, he wants to talk to you. Nick takes the phone from her hands and she closes the door."
nick, Hello?
george,"So what's this I hear about you being gay? George sprawls on the couch, cradling the phone with one hand, and holding a beer on his stomach with the other. WE  INTERCUT."
nick,What's this I hear about you being unemployed?
george,"Yes, but my condition is only temporary. I can change it."
nick,I hope you do. We need the money.
george,"Nick, there are more important things in life than money."
nick,"I know, Dad. Like getting a good education. And being able to respect your parents."
george,I've got two words for you. Safe sex.
nick,"Thanks, Dad. He hangs up the phone."
nick,"Hello, uh... My name is Nick. Nick Twisp. My father's name is George Twisp."
nick,"Not lately. But he's missed several child support payments, and is not looking for work. So now I'm going to public school in Oakland."
nick,Yes. And he's had an offer from a respectable publication in Ukiah.
nick,"Hey, Lefty. How's it hangin'?"
lefty,"You'll never believe who called me, Nick. Millie Filbert!"
nick,What?!? Why?
lefty,I dunno. She just called and asked if I wanted to hang out tonight. I didn't want to ask why. I need to find someplace for us to get it on. Albert squats to poop in someone's yard. The boys pause to wait for him.
nick,You can use my house if you want.
lefty,Really?
nick,"Sure. My Mom and Lance are going to a movie and I'm planning on stealing Jerry's trailer and torching it in a parking lot, so you'll have the whole house to yourself."
lefty,Right on. Albert finishes his business and they resume walking.
nick,So where you headed anyway?
lefty,Dr. Browerly's office. My parents are making me see a shrink now.
nick,He asking lots of weird questions?
lefty,You bet your left nut he is! He asked if I had any lustful thoughts toward my sister.
nick,What did you tell him?
lefty,I told him about beating off once with her brassiere.
nick,What did you tell him that for?
lefty,You don't know what it's like. I think they release chemicals in their office to make you tell the truth.
nick,Sounds like a professional. He must be very expensive.
lefty,I wouldn't know. The bill goes to your house.
nick,My mom is paying for your therapy?
lefty,I guess so. It was your cyclops I was staring at.
nick,"Yes, but it was your idea."
lefty,"That's true. Gee, maybe I am gay."
nick,Don't be retarded. We were doing research for our girlfriends.
lefty,"Oh, right. I forgot. That's a relief. So you'll leave the door open?"
nick,"Yeah, just don't blow your load on my sheets."
lefty,"Thanks a pantsful, Nick."
nick,"Don't mention it. See ya, Lefty."
estelle,"Lance and I are walking down to the movie theater. There's TV dinners in the freezer. Oh, and Nick - your father got a job in Ukiah."
nick,Mom? Do you think it might be a good idea if I moved in with him?
estelle,"Nick, that just wouldn't work. I depend on that child support money to eat."
nick,"But shouldn't you depend on the child support money for, you know... child support?"
estelle,Watch your smart mouth. She slams the door.  EXT. ESTELLE'S HOME - DAY
nick,"Oh no! I forgot to set the brake! The DRIVER OF THE FIAT bolts after the accelerating Lincoln, but as he realizes the futility, slows to a jog. The driver turns to see he forgot to set his own brake, and desperately rolls out of the way of the Fiat. MOTORISTS slam on their brakes as the speeding trailer crosses four lanes of traffic. It jumps the curb crashing into the plate glass window of a gourmet sausage shop. A cop car lights up and speeds into the intersection, just in time to get clipped by the Lincoln. The cop car goes into a tail spin, smashing into a chicken transport. The flock of feathered inmates fly for freedom."
nick,"Hey, Mom! How was the movie?"
lance,You little shit. You stole your mother's dead ex-boyfriend's trailer and set a five million dollar fire.
estelle,Nick! They have a description of the arsonist! Lance flips through his notebook and reads.
lance,"A white teenage male, about five- seven. A hundred and twenty five pounds, dark hair, spotted complexion..."
nick,That could be anyone.
lance,"He was also wearing a tee shirt with the words: I'm single, let's mingle. Nick glances down at the lettering on his shirt. Oops. Estelle bursts into tears."
estelle,What am I going to do? My only son will be sent to prison! Lance takes Estelle in his arms and smirks at Nick.
estelle,"Oh, Lance, can't something be done?"
lance,"Tell you what, Estelle. I'll make out that Nick reported the car and trailer stolen before the fire. It'll be less suspicious. But I could take some serious heat for this."
estelle,"Oh, Lance! You're wonderful! How can I possibly repay you?"
lance,"I'll think of something, Estelle. He gives her ass a playful squeeze. She lets out a giggle."
lance,Now the kid better not be here when the detectives start coming around. I'd send him away for a while. A long while.
estelle,He can go make his father's life miserable! Nick suddenly brightens.
nick,But I like it here.
estelle,"You're going, buster! She snatches up the phone and dials. George's groggy voice can be heard answering. Estelle screams into the phone."
estelle,You're son just burned down half of Berkeley! Come and get the little brat!
lance,"Wait a minute, Estelle, aren't you going to punish him? I'd say he deserves a good hiding."
estelle,(cupping the squawking
nick,Are you through? Lance looks around the room. Picks up an umbrella and considers it in his hand. Nick hangs his head.
nick,I was wondering what happened to you. Did you get to blow your wad?
lefty,No. I did not get to blow my wad.
nick,Did you get interrupted?
lefty,No. Worse.
nick,What's worse than being interrupted?
lefty,Millie is a lesbian.
lefty,The only reason she wanted to hang out with me is because she heard that I showed you my slinky and thought I was gay too.
nick,"Sorry, man. I didn't have a great night either."
lefty,"Well, I dunno what you're gonna do, but I'm giving suicide serious consideration this time."
nick,Or you could just fake it and then hide out in Ukiah with me. Then later come back and maybe Millie Filbert will boink you out of pity.
lefty,"Hey, that's not a bad idea. Thanks a pantsful, Nick. A pair of headlights swing into the drive and Lefty ducks out of sight. The headlights turn out to belong to George Twisp's"
lacey,"Hiya, Nick!"
nick,"Hi, Lacey. Hi, Dad. The trunk pops open."
nick,"Is there any way I could sit up front with Lacey, Dad? Mom's boyfriend beat me pretty badly."
george,"Sorry, Nick. In this car, faggots get the back seat."
george,My God. Look what you've done. Lacey turns to look at Nick over the seat. They share a smile.
george,"Go ahead and bring your stuff inside. Lacey and I need a nap. C'mon, Sugar Puss. Nick watches longingly as George leads Lacey into the home. As he places his hand on Lacey's ass, he looks back over his shoulder and throws a smug look in Nick's direction."
nick,"Uhm, hello. Is Sheeni available?"
nick,Excuse me?
nick,That rat-fink-fuck!
nick,Santa Cruz! But she'll be miserable without me. We're in love. The ogre snorts in condescending amusement.
sheeni,"Nick! Oh, Nick! Nick lights up at the sight of her and they embrace. They kiss passionately. He works his way to her neck and starts to reach under the sweatshirt."
sheeni,I had to sneak away just to see you.
nick,That's okay. I had to burn down half of Berkley.
sheeni,"That was you? Nick, are you out of your mind?"
nick,"I felt a grand gesture was required, darling. Sheeni's expression indicates that she is touched, but it turns to troubled."
sheeni,"Nick, Trent betrayed us."
nick,Franois will kill him later.
sheeni,Who's Franois?
nick,Nevermind. The point is we must elope. Sheeni takes a step back at the notion.
sheeni,"I don't know, Nick. I do love you, but I don't want to spend the rest of our lives on the run."
nick,It's a small price to pay. She takes another step back.
sheeni,"I... I can't, Nick."
nick,"What?!? But, Sheeni. I just don't get it. I'm here. Albert's here too."
sheeni,"I know, Nick, and I've been longing for you so. But we'll just have to find another way. The car is already packed. Nick nods glumly and Sheeni seems overcome with remorse."
sheeni,"Nick Twisp, I will not allow you to accept defeat so easily!"
nick,Or we could consummate here in the woods.
sheeni,Did you bring the consumer reports? Nick just blinks blankly.
sheeni,"Then it will have to be Santa Cruz. I really must go now, darling."
nick,"Well... Goodbye, Sheeni. I love you."
sheeni,I love you too. Squeeze darling Albert for me. She pulls her hood over her head. Nick watches wistfully as she slips away into the forest.
cut to:,"Nick does his best to not be pinned by DWAYNE CRAMPTON, who out-weighs him by at least 40 pounds."
dwayne,Sorry `bout wompin' ya. I'm Dwayne.
nick,Nick. Nick Twisp.
dwayne,"Say, Nick? Why do you suppose guys got only two testicles when we got ten fingers and toes?"
nick,I could not begin to speculate. Nick turns off his shower and slinks away.
paul,"Hey, Nick. I'm Paul, Sheeni's brother. Nick comes up the path to meet him."
nick,"Hello, Paul. How did you know my name?"
paul,We've met.
nick,No we haven't.
paul,In a previous life.
nick,Oh. Paul begins rolling a joint.
paul,Nice fire in Berkeley.
nick,Did Sheeni tell you that was me?
paul,She didn't have to.
nick,Why? Was I an arsonist in a previous life?
paul,No. But Sheeni was.
nick,My God. What did she burn?
paul,Men. Men and boys. Paul hands the joint out to Nick. He regards it dubiously.
nick,"My God, Franois! What was Paul smoking?"
francois,"Shut up and go with it. Nick shrugs and opens the top dresser drawer, revealing Lacey's lingerie. Nick starts dancing, doing a strip tease for himself. WE PAN AROUND the room, and when we reach Nick again, he's wearing nothing but a pair of Lacey's thongs. He models in front of the mirror, regarding his bulging T.E. He removes a C-cup bra and holds it high. He uses the elastic straps to fasten the bra onto his head. He starts dancing up a storm to the cheesy Vengaboys rendition of BRAZIL in his head. Waving arms. Bicycling leg movements."
george,What the... What the hell? Nick gives a startled jump.
lacey,Is..? Is that my bra?
george,We're calling that fruitcake display strike one. Two more strikes and it's back to Oakland. Nick nods. The front door opens and MRS. CRAMPTON enters with Safeway bags of her own. Dwayne follows close behind her.
dwayne,"Hey, Nick! Albert barks and jumps at Dwayne's feet."
nick,"Uh... Hi, Dwayne. What are you doing here?"
dwayne,Ain't ya heard. We're gonna be roommates! Ain't that zinky? Nick looks to his father in horror as Dwayne goes chasing after the dog.
nick,Uh... Dad? What's going on?
george,Mrs. Crampton's our new housekeeper. I'm renting out the spare room to her seeing as her camper has been deemed unfit for human habitation.
nick,What about Dwayne?
george,He's bunking with you.
nick,Dad!
george,You working on strike two? Nick leans back and glares in silent protest as everyone takes their seats at the table.
dwayne,"Say, Nick. You wanna sleep in bed with me? It'll be tons warmer."
nick,"No thank you, Dwayne. A knock at the door. Lacey enters."
lacey,"This came for you, Nick. Nick sits up in bed to receive the letter. As Lacey leaves, he tears through the wax seal and unfolds its contents."
dwayne,"Is it a love letter, Nick?"
nick,"I don't know, it's in French. Say, why does your mother give you sleeping pills?"
dwayne,"`Cuz otherwise I'd stay up all night playin' Nintendo Wii. Say, Nick, can I walk Albert?"
nick,I don't know. Dogs don't grow on trees.
dwayne,"Pleeease, Nick?"
nick,Okay. But it will cost you one sleeping pill per walk.
dwayne,"Whatchu want them pills for, Nick?"
nick,You never know when sedatives will come in handy.
nick,Lefty?
lefty,"Oh. Hey, Nick!"
nick,"Lefty, what are you doing here?"
lefty,I live here. The guy's only charging me fifty in cash a month.
nick,"I mean, what are you doing in town?"
lefty,"I did what you told me, Nick. I threw my backpack off the pier and reported my own suicide. I even left a note."
nick,"Wow, Lefty, I'm kinda impressed. Faking your suicide is pretty ballsy. Lefty joins Nick in his walk down the road."
lefty,So where you headed?
nick,Redwood High School.
lefty,Can I come?
nick,Why would you want to go to school if you didn't have to?
lefty,"It's weird, Nick, but school seems like a pretty fun place to hang out once you get rid of classes and homework."
nick,I can see this stunt really has liberated your mind.
lefty,"I'm telling you, Nick: killing myself was the best thing that ever happened to me."
vijay,May I sit at your table?
lefty,Sure. I'm Lefty and this is Nick.
vijay,I am Vijay Joshi. Vijay sits and shakes their hands.
vijay,I see you both have been rejected by the socially elite of our school. Ukiah is a cultural wasteland compared to India. Though some of the girls are very attractive.
nick,Do you have a girlfriend?
vijay,Not at the moment. But I am optimistic. How about you?
nick,"Yes, but she transferred."
vijay,You don't mean Sheeni Saunders. I heard she was interested in some brilliant fellow in the Bay Area.
lefty,"Hey, that's you, Nick."
vijay,I'm surprised. You are not at all what I imagined. Nick narrows his eyes.
vijay,So how is Sheeni?
nick,I don't know. She sent me this letter. But it's in French.
vijay,Shall I translate it for you?
nick,You speak French?
vijay,"I speak French, English, Hindi, Marathi, and Urdu."
lefty,"That must come in handy. Nick hands over the letter and Vijay starts reading it silently. He chuckles as he reads and Nick squints his eyes at him in annoyance. Vijay picks up on it, clears his throat and reads aloud."
vijay,"Dear, Nick..."
sheeni,Perhaps you should consider learning French and enrolling. That said...
nick,That's it? Nothing else about me? Vijay picks up the letter again.
vijay,Oh yes... Love to you and Albert.  Who's Albert?
nick,Albert is our dog. This is a disaster. What the hell does she mean Trent wants to mend the relationship?
vijay,"I don't know, but this Taggarty girl sounds very uninhibited. I wonder if she's made it with a Hindu yet."
lefty,Heather sounds like a babe. You think if I grew a beard I'd pass for college age?
nick,I've got to get to Sheeni as soon as possible. If I don't Trent Preston is going to mindfuck her into thinking she doesn't like me.
lefty,"And then he'll probably fuck her in other ways. Did you know you're supposed to put your pinkie in a girl's bumhole, Vijay?"
nick,Will you shut up and help me out?
lefty,"Sorry, Nick. What should we do?"
nick,"I suggest we steal my father's BMW and take a trip to Santa Cruz. Vijay, you'll have to be our translator."
vijay,But what will we tell our parents?
lefty,You can tell your father you are staying at Nick's house for the weekend. And visa versa.
nick,Good thinking.
vijay,But what if we are caught?
nick,"To hell with it, Vijay. It's time to take action! THREE CUTS. The JINGLE as Nick removes his Dad's keys from the bureau. The trunk SLAMMING closed with the sleeping bags inside. The ROAR of the engine as Vijay's hand turns the key in the ignition."
lefty,"What is this music, Nick?"
nick,It's Dave Brubeck.  I thought a person as cultured as yourself would appreciate it.
vijay,You want culture? I will give you culture. Vijay puts in his own CD and Ravi Shankar's TARANA blasts from the speakers. Nick gives Vijay a grin of approval. MUSIC PLAYS OVER...
sheeni,"Nickie? Nick, Vijay, and Lefty are noticeably shorter than the older boys around them."
nick,"Hello, Sheeni.  Hi, I'm Nick."
taggarty,Oh. So you're Nick.
heather,We've heard so much about you.
nick,And this is Vijay. And this is Lefty. Lefty goes to USC.
lefty,And I'm not gay.
sheeni,"Nick, I knew you'd come! Sheeni glances over at the disapproving MATRON. She leans in close."
sheeni,...but you must wait in the car until we can sneak you in. Nick nods in understanding.
heather,"Lefty, should maybe sleep in my room. It's pretty crowded in here."
lefty,Your roommate won't mind?
heather,"Oh, Darlene went home for the weekend. Lefty gulps and picks up his grip. He pauses in the hallway."
lefty,"Well, see you guys in the morning. The door closes and Vijay and Nick exchange a knowing glance."
sheeni,"Pardon me, everyone. Sheeni steps into the tiny closet to change. Vijay and Nick regard the..."
nick,There's your competition.
vijay,A distinguished group I would be happy to join. The two boys turn around and watch in hot-blooded bliss as Taggarty searches for her misplaced nightie.
vijay,I am in a state of sexual frenzy. What is your plan?
nick,"We drape a blanket over the lower bunk for Sheeni and me. You tackle Taggarty on the top bunk. Here's a condom. I slipped two to Lefty, leaving us with four."
vijay,What if they don't go for it?
nick,They'll go for it. You can cut the sexual tension in that room with a knife.
sheeni,"Don't be silly, darling. Not with others in the room.  We must wait until everyone falls asleep. Nick tries to appear unconcerned. She gives him a kiss and climbs into her narrow bed. As Nick and Vijay prepare their sleeping bags on the floor, they watch Taggarty climb up to her bunk in the sky."
taggerty,Goodnight boys. Do you need the light on to take off your clothes?
nick,No.  We can find our zippers in the dark.
nick,Sheeni?
sheeni,"Yes, Nick?"
nick,Was that the matron?
sheeni,No. Beat.
nick,Then who was it?
sheeni,It was Trent. Beat.
nick,Did you say it was Trent?
sheeni,Yes. He came to discuss our friendship. I told him now was not the time.
nick,So where is Trent now?
sheeni,"I assume he went back to the boys' dorm. Now really, Nickie, you are keeping everyone awake with your inquiries. Though silence follows, we take a moment to allow Nick's mind to race in the dark. He stands and looks at the mirror above the dresser. Franois can be made out sitting by the window in the moonlight, stroking the Thompson."
franois,Now is our chance.
nick,Chance for what?
franois,To confront our nemesis. We must go to the boys' dorm and kill Trent where he sleeps.
nick,I suppose we should at least get a look at him. To see what we're dealing with.
franois,Very well. (stubbing out his
nick,Trent?
ed,No. Who the hell are you?
nick,I am Nick Twisp.
ed,"Oh, so you're Nick."
nick,Is Trent here?
ed,"You just missed him, Nick. He just grabbed a couple condoms and left."
nick,Did he say where he was going?
ed,I think he said he was going to Heather's room.
nick,But that's where Lefty is. Who are you?
ed,Ed. Ed Solomon. Trent's roommate.
nick,"Oh, so you're Ed."
ed,What's that supposed to mean?
nick,"Nothing. It's just that Sheeni mentioned Trent has a thing for a guy named Ed, and that he touches the guy when he falls asleep. But obviously if that were you, you'd know about it. Must be a different Ed Solomon. Take care now. Nick takes off running and Ed stares after him."
heather,"What's up, Nick?"
nick,Is Trent in there?
heather,Not anymore.
nick,What happened to Lefty?
heather,"Trent was here, but he left. He only dropped by to lend us a couple more condoms."
nick,But I gave Lefty two already.
heather,"Yes, and that was very generous of you, but the night is young."
nick,"So what is Trent, the fucking condom faerie!?!"
lefty,"You can have one of ours, Nick. If you need one. The fact that Nick doesn't yet raises his temperament even further."
nick,So where did he say he was going?
heather,"He didn't say, but I'm pretty sure I just saw him go into our bathroom down the hall."
nick,"Thanks. Oh, and I'd be careful with those condoms. Trent's roommate Ed said that Trent pokes holes in them so that he can get Sheeni pregnant and be with her forever. And with that piece of disturbing info, he leaves them."
bernice,Who are you?
nick,"I'm Sheeni's friend, Nick. Sorry to disturb you."
bernice,"That's OK. It was something I ate. So wait, are you Sheeni's boyfriend?"
nick,"Uh, yeah."
bernice,My name's Bernice. Bernice Lynch. Not that you asked.
nick,"Nice to meet you Bernice. Actually, I think Trent Preston mentioned you. He said you were frumpy, but now that I've met you, I can see Trent is a lying bastard."
bernice,Thanks. And Trent can go to hell for all I care. Sheeni too.
nick,You don't like Sheeni?
bernice,"Personally, I hate her guts. Well, pardon me, Nick. I feel like throwing up some more now."
nick,You didn't happen to see Trent Preston did you? She waves him away as she bends over the sink to hurl again. Then lifts her face and smiles through the dripping bile.
bernice,I did actually. I think he was on his way to Sheeni's room. Nick's eyes widen in alarm.
nick,Sheeni?
sheeni,"Yes, darling."
nick,Was Trent here?
sheeni,"Yes, Nick. Nick hangs his head."
sheeni,"But I sent him away again. Nick stares into her eyes to discern her honesty, but he finds nothing but adoration."
sheeni,"Because I want you, darling. Not even Trent can match the industriousness and tenacity with which you have pursued me."
matron,"Q'est que c'est passer ici?!? Nick bolts upright, smacking his head against the top bunk. He lands on the floor, where he gets a view of... Trent standing behind the matron. The blinding light makes his features difficult to make out but his white teeth are definitely smiling diabolically."
lefty,I did it three times! Two long ones and a quickie.
nick,"Great. Just great. How about you, Vijay?"
vijay,"It was difficult to tell with that condom, Nick. Why did you buy such thick ones?"
nick,That brand was top-rated by Consumers.
vijay,"Well, she's safe. No organism could penetrate those walls."
nick,You think the girls are in trouble?
vijay,They will likely notify their parents. Perhaps even expel them.
nick,That's it! Expel them. Then Sheeni will have to come back to Ukiah. The car sputters. Nick's eyes go to the gas gauge.
vijay,What will we do?
nick,"Well, we can't stay in the car. Sooner or later Highway Patrol is going to come by and ask for our non-existent driver's license."
lefty,But we have no money!
vijay,I have no shoes! I'll catch pneumonia and die a indeterminate proto-quasi-virgin!
nick," Mom? It's Nick. I'm sorry to wake you, but I'm hoping you'll help your only son. Especially seeing as it would really piss off Dad. A long beat."
wally,"Pardon me. But is one of you Nick Twisp? The two other boys exchange confused glances, not entirely if this is how people go missing."
nick,Yeah. I'm Nick.
wally,"I'm Wally. I'm a friend of your mom's. Nick nods, not yet sure whether or not this gentle giant is actually blushing with shyness or red with agitation at being sent on a midnight mission."
wally,"So, uhm, uh... Your mom says you need a ride. Did I mention I'm a friend? Nick breaks into a smile. Finally the Gods have cut him a break."
estelle,Wally was a friend of Jerry's. He came to help me in my time of mourning.
nick,"What happened to Lance? Estelle's face registers ""none of your business,"" but a kind look from Wally and she softens."
estelle,Lance is busy training to be a detective. He isn't around as much as he used to be. Nick nods and goes back to eating.
estelle,"Mr. Rumpkin is very smart. Ask him a question, Nick."
nick,"Okay. Mr. Rumpkin, what famous actress was married to Frank Sinatra, Artie Shaw, and Mickey Rooney?"
lefty,"Whoever she is, she sure gets around."
wally,Ava Gardner. Estelle smiles with pride. Nick and the other boys regard the gentle giant with admiration. He bashfully averts his eyes.
estelle,That's nothing. You should see what he did with the living room.
estelle,"Go ahead, Wally. Show them. Wally blushes before he flips a switch and the tail lights come on, giving the living room a warm, flattering glow."
wally,"Well, uhm... It was nice meeting you, Nick."
nick,"You too, Mr. Rumpkin. Wally blushes even more. He closes the door and starts to turn the truck around. Nick watches him go. Wally waves goodbye. Nick turns and the three boys make their way down the dusty road."
nick,Where's Dad?
lacey,"In the bedroom. I wouldn't bother him, Nick. He's in a foul mood. He's on with the police. Apparently someone broke in and stole his Beamer. Lacey gives Nick an amused smile."
dwayne,"Nick, you got a girlfriend?"
nick,"Yes, I do."
dwayne,"If you asked your girlfriend as a favor, would she do it with me?"
nick,Guys don't share their girlfriends.
dwayne,"I get ya. You're worried `cause your girlfriend might get knocked up. What if I pull out, Nick? Nick seethes inwardly. There comes a ruckus from the back bedroom and Lacey emerges."
lacey,"It's not my fault, you tight-assed, critical, nonfeeling, sexist drunk."
lacey,"Does it bother you that you're a selfish, uptight, boring lover?"
nick,You forgot lousy driver! George appears in the doorway.
george,"That's strike two, jerkoff! Nick hangs his head. George moves about the kitchen chugging from a jug of zin. Lacey picks up the ringing phone."
lacey,Hello?
lacey,"They found your car in Davenport, George. Go pick it up."
george,Look who's wearing the pants this morning. Lacey takes a seat next to Nick and sighs.
lacey,"Nick, I feel for you. It must be tough being a teenager in this house."
nick,My mother wasn't any better.
lacey,Your mom has had a difficult time. She has had a great deal to put up with. I'm starting to appreciate that now.
george,Are you by any chance referring to me?
lacey,"If the shoe fits, suck on it. George swills some zin and mumbles ominously."
george,We'll see who's sucking on what soon.
vijay,"I spoke with Taggarty this morning. She requested a wallet sized photo. Nick looks up glumly from his lunch. Lefty has his feet up on the table, his facial growth is almost respectable."
lefty,"Congratulations, Vijay. That makes it official. Welcome to the club. Nick narrows his eyes at the two non-virgins."
nick,What grade did you receive?
vijay,A C+. Which I feel is perfectly satisfactory given the conditions.
lefty,I guess this means they're not being expelled.
vijay,"No, apparently they convinced the matron it was all quite innocent."
nick,Are you kidding? She had her flashlight trained on your Hindi boner! A beat. Lefty and Vijay seem taken aback by the outburst.
vijay,"No need to be jealous, Nick. Nick stands and collects his lunch tray."
nick,"Dear Bernice, it was nice meeting you this weekend in the bathroom."
nick,Where's Dad?
paul,"We saved you some mushrooms, Nick. Nick watches the sensual foot message. He picks up the bag full of mushrooms and considers them."
the hall,and into...
lacey,Nick? Get the phone? Nick picks up the phone and Paul takes his place at Lacey's feet.
nick, Hello?
george,Nick? Is that you?
nick,I am Nick Twisp. I am alive. I am a breathing organism.
george,"Quit fooling around, Nick. This is your dad. Is everything okay there?"
nick,"Don't be afraid, Dad. Everything will be okay. You deserve to be loved."
george,What the hell is that supposed to mean? Is Lacey there?
nick,Lacey is here. Paul is caressing her toes.
george,Paul! Who the hell is Paul?
nick,Paul is our friend. He makes beautiful music for the acrobats. They're naked.
george,Who's naked? Is Lacey naked?
nick,"Don't be afraid, Dad. Goodbye. He hangs up the phone and pulls out the cord. He joins Paul in working Lacey's feet."
nick,Dad is afraid.
lacey,He is on the wrong path. I have felt that for some time.
living room,where Paul stands between George and Lacey.
paul,"Okay, George, just calm down. George lunges and Paul socks him in the eye, dropping him to the floor."
george,You are in serious trouble. You've assaulted me and I know for a fact that you two were having naked orgies with my son. That child is only twelve years old. George gets to his feet.
nick,"I'm sixteen, Dad."
george,Shut your pie hole! (turning to Lacey and
lacey,"Don't be an idiot, George. No one was naked."
george,"When you get out of prison, you will both have to register as sex offenders. You will never be able to get a decent job again."
paul,I've never had a decent job. I don't think I'd want one.
lacey,"Let's go, Paul. George, I'll pick up the rest of my things tomorrow."
george,Not until you pay me the rest of the money you owe.
lacey,I paid you all your money!
george,Not the extra charges. She gets up in his face.
lacey,"Fuck-your-stinking-extra-charges. As Lacey and Paul depart, Nick turns and dreamily wanders back toward his room."
dwayne,What's all the ruckus about?
nick,Dwayne! Please cover yourself.
dwayne,You wanna play Nintendo all night?
nick,"Of course not. I'm tired. Let's go to sleep. Nick unplugs the Nintendo and climbs into bed. Dwayne just sits there on the floor, naked as a clam."
nick,"Wake up! I know what you were doing last night, you disgusting beast!"
dwayne,"Don't be mad, Nick. I like you. Dwayne throws off his sheets. Nick shudders at the sight. ...which is when Mrs. Crampton barges in.."
dwayne,"Nick made me take them off, Mom. He took off his too."
nick,"We weren't doing anything, Mrs. Crampton. It was just hot last night."
nick,Taggarty? It's Nick.
taggarty,"Hey, Nick. I suppose you want to talk to Sheeni."
nick,"If you please. Taggarty crosses to the bunks, where Sheeni is curled up among the sheets as if in some Renaissance portrait."
taggarty,It's your would-be-lover. Sheeni sleepily takes the phone.
sheeni,Nick?
nick,"Hello, My Beloved. How are you?"
sheeni,Not so well. I have been afflicted with some kind of chronic fatigue.
nick,Perhaps you are home sick. You do sound rather blue.
sheeni,"I'm not home sick, Nick. In fact, I'm not very happy with you."
nick,Me? What did I do?
sheeni,"You know damn well, Nick. You've been spreading rumors about Trent. And he doesn't deserve it."
nick,Doesn't deserve it!?! I'd have to claim he has genital warts to sink to his level.
sheeni,"Well, whatever you said to Ed Solomon, it was enough to get him to give Trent a black eye."
nick,"Sheeni, I just don't get it. This guy has cock-blocked at every turn and you're taking his side?!?"
sheeni,Cock-blocked?
nick,Lacey's not a floozie.
sheeni,Lacey? You know her?
nick,Of course. She's my father's ex- girlfriend. I think that might make you my stepmother-in-law.
sheeni,Nick. Don't be gross.
nick,"Sorry. At any rate, I'll let you go. We'll have plenty of time to settle this tomorrow."
sheeni,Tomorrow?
nick,"Yes, Sheeni, Thanksgiving. I'll be coming for dinner, of course."
sheeni,"Don't even think it, Nick. You know my parents don't approve of you."
nick,"I'm confident they will learn to love me. After all, I'm practically family."
sheeni,"Nick, you must dismiss this Thanksgiving notion from your mind. I remain firm on this issue. Goodbye. CLICK. Nick regards the phone defensively. He puts it down and takes a seat at the table. He glares at Dwayne as they eat breakfast. There comes a knock at the front door."
nick,"Don't move, blubber boy, I'll get it."
police officer,Is George Twisp in?
nick,"Uh, I'm pretty sure he's sleeping off a hangover, Officer. Is he under arrest?"
police officer,"Under arrest? No, I'm the officer working the case of his stolen car."
nick,Ah.
police officer,You can tell your pop that the CD he found in his car is Ravi Shankar.
nick,Excuse me?
police officer,"Indian music. So we're a checkin' the INS files, see if we can get some prints that match. You wouldn't know anyone who might have stolen the car who listens to this crap, would ya, son?"
nick,"No, and I'm not sure I like the implication. Ravi Shankar is beloved by many Caucasian..."
dwayne,I'm pretty sure he's Injun. The officer makes a note.
police officer," Vijay Joshi. We'll look into it. Thank you, boys. Nick gives a weak smile and closes the door."
living room,where the phone RINGS. He flips off the stereo with the remote and snatches up the phone.
nick,Twisp residence.
nick,"Oh. Hey, Mom. What's up?"
nick,Okay. I'm ready. What is it?
nick,What's the bad news?
nick,"Lefty, have you seen Vijay, today?"
lefty,"Nick, haven't you heard? Vijay's been arrested."
nick,Arrested?!?
lefty,For grand theft auto. They found his prints in your father's car.
nick,That's terrible. Did he go quietly?
lefty,No. He said you were his accomplice and now the Ukiah police are looking for you! We linger a beat on Nick's blank expression. Then -
paul,"Hello, Nick. Right on time. Come in."
nick,"Happy Thanksgiving, Lacey. She spots the sad flowers in his hand."
lacey,"What interesting flowers, Nick. Who are they for?"
nick,"Uh, Mrs. Saunders. Lacey leads him by the hand into the chintz-bedecked parlor. Sheeni's larger-than-life father and 5,000 year old mother sit cross-legged on the floor, running their hands over the hooked rug."
lacey,"Mr. and Mrs. Saunders, you remember Nick Twisp, don't you? Mrs. Saunders coos and takes the flowers. Her husband squints up at him."
paul,"No he's not, Dad. He just appears tall because you are on the floor."
lacey,Paul served an appetizer earlier.
paul,"Yes, it's a recipe I picked up in the Southwest. Stuffed mushrooms. Nick smiles with amusement."
taggerty,How is the star-crossed persistent lover? She greets him with a casually intimate kiss.
nick,"Okay, I guess. Where's Sheeni?"
taggerty,"Upstairs, Nick. She saw you coming and hid in her room."
nick,"Dinner is almost ready, My Love."
sheeni,I do not intend to be party to my brother's absurdities. He has allowed you in and drugged my parents.
nick,I think they are deriving some good from the experience. Sheeni finally looks up from her book.
sheeni,"What are you doing here, Nick? I expressly asked you not to come."
nick,"To hell with that. What do I have to do to prove my love to you? My friends have gotten laid and I'm pretty sure neither one of them was beaten with a tree trunk, raped by a walrus, or had to contend with the likes of Trent Preston!"
sheeni,You were raped by a walrus?
nick,"Sheeni, I have shown restraint, I have committed crimes, I have traveled to the lengths of the state and still you won't give me this one little thing."
sheeni,"Sex, Nick. Why don't you just say it? That's what you want. You want me to have sex with you."
sheeni,How is my dog?
nick,"Excellent. He should be coming out of the oven right about now. She tosses the book at him, but he dodges it successfully."
sheeni,"I hate you, Nickie! She stands up and tries to slap him. He grabs her wrists and pulls her to him."
nick,"I hate you too. They share a long, intense kiss. They break away and she smiles in spite of herself."
lacey,"Dear Lord... Mr. Saunders emits a long, low, fog horn of a fart that ends badly. The others exchange glances but he and his wife still have their heads solemnly bowed."
lacey,"Dear Lord, thank you for this bounty. Help us to be tolerant of others - especially the boyfriends and girlfriends of our immediate relations. Amen."
everyone,Amen.
paul,"Well, mother, he is sitting in his own bowel movement."
taggarty,"The food is delicious, Paul."
paul,Thank you.
sheeni,"Not long enough, Paul."
nick,I hope it's the first of many such occasions for me. Sheeni narrows her eyes at him. A long beat as they all dine in silence. Then- Mrs. Saunders croaks out in song.
everyone,Round yon virgin Mother and Child/ Holy infant so tender and mild/ Sleep in heavenly peace... Sle-eep in heavenly pee-eace.
taggarty,"Oh, Trent, you made it. Nick glances up with a start as TRENT PRESTON makes his entrance. He's not quite the deity Nick's expected, but rather a fairly plain, blond with slightly androgenous features and a certain flamboyance. His black eye, courtesy of Ed Solomon, still remains."
trent,"Hello, Taggarty. Hello, Everyone. Mr. Saunders grunts his acknowledgement as he takes the pitcher and pours water into his own lap."
sheeni,"Trent, darling, this is Nick. Trent swivels slowly around and they lock eyes."
trent,"Nick, at last we meet."
nick,"Hello, Trent."
taggarty,"Have a seat, Trent."
trent,"I'm sorry, Taggarty, I can't stay. I have bad news."
sheeni,What is it?
trent,Bernice Lynch has tried to commit suicide. Sheeni and Taggarty gasp. Nick swallows hard.
trent,"She swallowed a number of sleeping pills, and is now in a coma."
sheeni,The poor girl.
trent,"There's more. Before I left school, I searched her room."
nick,Did you obtain proper authorization from the officials?
trent,"No, Nick, I acted on my own initiative. In Bernice's closet, I found this letter. He dramatically extracts the letter from his pocket."
trent,"In the letter, the writer instructed Bernice to begin sedating Sheeni with drugs he himself supplied."
taggarty,"Nick, you didn't!"
nick,"Well, you see..."
sheeni,Nick! You could have killed me!
trent,"No one yet, Mr. Saunders. Mrs. Saunders points a liver spotted finger in his direction."
trent,I can't arrest him. But I have called the Santa Cruz Police. They are on their way here now. Nick places his napkin next to his plate and stands.
nick,"Well, I shall be going now. Please continue without me."
trent,"Nick, I suggest you remain here and face the consequences like a man. Nick stops in front of Trent."
nick,"Thank you for that unsolicited counsel, Trent. And please, do drop dead. The other guests murmur their shock. Nick stops in the doorway."
nick,"Goodbye, Sheeni. I did it all for you."
sheeni,"You are completely contemptible, Nick Twisp. I never wish to see you again. With the dreadful proclamation ringing in his ears, Nick leaves."
nick,"Uh, Hi, Joanie. How's it going?"
joanie,Nick?
joanie,"Nick, six months ago you were just another brownnosing honor student. What happened?"
nick,I'm not really sure. I fell in love with Sheeni. All I want is to be with her. The rest is all a big misunderstanding.
joanie,"Nick, you've stolen, vandalized, trespassed, and burned down Berkeley. All for one girl. If there's a misunderstanding, it's with your insight into females."
nick,But... But where did I go wrong?
joanie,"Nick, boys your age are always looking for the path of least resistance to becoming a man. A boy's whole self-esteem rests on how fast he can get a girl into bed."
nick,"So far, I agree."
joanie,"Sooner or later what those boys realize, is that the girls you're chasing base their self-esteem on how many hoops they can get the boy to jump through before going to bed with him. Nick furrows his brow. Clearly that had not occurred to him."
joanie,So I guess what you should ask yourself is: How far are you willing to go?
nick,"All the way, Joanie. I'm willing to go all the way. Joanie nods in amusement."
joanie,"You can stay here a couple days, but eventually they'll come looking for you. I don't have much money to give you, but here. Nick takes the wad of cash, clearly moved."
nick,"Thanks, Joanie. I... Uh... I love you."
joanie,"I love you too, you little brat."
nick,"One ticket to Ukiah, please."
lance,Yeah.
lance,"Nick, ya little prick, where are ya?"
nick,"You're on a need to know basis, gorilla boy. Lance seethes inwardly."
lance,"No matter, they'll get you eventually."
nick,Let me make it easy. I'll be at Redwood High School tomorrow morning. Round up your donut dipping friends. I'm turning myself in. Nick slams down the phone before Lance can respond.
nick,Lefty? Lefty lifts his eyes and sees his friend.
lefty,Nick? What are you doing here? Everyone and their mother's mother is looking for you.
nick,They have me soon enough. Where are you going?
lefty,"Home. I'm done being dead, Nick. Heather and I are going back to Oakland for Christmas. You should have heard how glad my parents were that I didn't kill myself. They were even happier when they found out I'm not gay."
nick,"That's great, Lefty."
lefty,"Yeah, being in love is pretty great. So what's your plan, Nick?"
paul,"Welcome back, Nick. We had a feeling you were coming."
tina,This is Tina Manion reporting live at Redwood High in Ukiah where local law enforcement as well as the FBI awaits the promised arrival of Nick Twisp. There comes a murmur from the crowd and Tina directs the student camera-man to the road on the ridge where... George's BMW pulls to a stop overlooking the school.
george,Hey. That's my car! The crowd hushes as the door opens and Nick emerges.
nick's pov,"of the parking lot below, which looks like the kind of turn out one would expect of a Star Wars prequel."
underwater,"The BMW descends toward us in a storm of air bubbles. As it gently touches down at the bottom of the lake, a somber TRUMPET SOLO comes in pre-lap and we are..."
heather,A little to the right... a little... RIGHT THERE! RIGHT THERE!
sheeni,"Excuse me. Are you a friend of Nick's? Carlotta looks up, startled. She composes herself and shakes Sheeni's hand."
sheeni,"You shouldn't be, Carlotta. I am no doubt culpable for Nick's actions."
sheeni,"Yes, Carlotta. Nick had wonderful a way of making me feel worthy of the pursuit."
sheeni,"Would you like to stay the night, Carlotta? We can reminisce of our departed."
sheeni,"It's just... I don't think I could bear to be alone tonight. Carlotta does her best not to look conflicted, but it shows."
sheeni,Do you like it? I bought it in Santa Rosa last fall. I had hoped to wear it for Nick.
sheeni,"I like lying here with you, Carlotta."
sheeni,I can't think of anyone I'd rather lie here with. Carlotta furrows her brow.
sheeni,"Except maybe Nick. If Nick were here, what do you suppose he would do to me?"
sheeni,Then why don't you?
sheeni,Take off that silly wig and make love to me! Sheeni tugs off the wig and tosses it across the room.
nick,Sheeni! You knew!
sheeni,"Of course, Nick. Did you really expect to fool your soul mate with such a disguise? Nick swoons, grasping her gauze-glazed nakedness."
sheeni,"Take me darling! And as they engage in a feverish kiss, ROUSING HYMNS surge. The church chorus' joyful song rings Hallelujah. The two lovers are entwined before an abstract RED"
sheeni,My parents are at services. They won't be back for hours.
nick,"Shall we have breakfast, my love?"
sheeni,"What a lovely notion, darling. You go ahead downstairs and get things started. Sheeni hauls herself out of bed and grabs the phone off the cradle."
nick,What are you doing?
sheeni,Calling Taggarty to report that you are not completely incompetent in the bedroom.
nick,Do I get to stay and hear my grade?
sheeni,"Not a chance, Mr. Twisp. Such things are reserved for girl talk only. And for good reason. She smiles at him and he smiles back."
nick,"Very well, Sheeni. Don't be long."
nick,"Well, good morning, Franois. What do you think?"
franois,What do I sink? I sink now's are chance to run for ze hills. Nick lowers his arms and furrows his brow.
nick,What do you mean?
franois,"Nick, we are young, yes? Is the world not our oyster? Beaucoup des filles. Do you not want to know what it is like to make love to another girl?"
nick,"I do, but... We've come so far. What about Sheeni?"
franois,"Forget Sheeni. Yes, she will always be ze first conquest, but all zis time you saught zis was ze end, ze one and only, when in fact it is only ze beginning. Nick lifts his eyebrows with dawning epiphany. In the reflection we can see behind Nick as Albert leaps onto the love seat and barks at the sound of approaching sirens. Nick runs to the window just in time to see half a dozen law enforcement vehicles pull up."
nick,"Sheeni, the police are here! He ducks down from the window as a chopper buzzes overhead."
nick,Quick! Maybe I can sneak out the back!
nick,I don't understand. How do they even know I'm alive?
nick,"Well, thanks a pantsful!"
sheeni,"But, Nickie, it had to be done."
nick,But... but why?
sheeni,"I can't very well marry a wanted man, honey. Look at it this way, in a few months you'll be a free man and we can be together in Paris. Nick looks to Franois in disbelief. But the Frenchman just rolls his eyes."
franois,"You might as well break it to her now, Nick. A long pensive beat as Nick contemplates telling her he may never see her again. But behind Sheeni's air of control, Nick finally sees the vulnerability he's had in his hands all along."
nick,"As always, you are right, my love. Sheeni beams. Franois smacks his forehead with hand."
franois,Merd. The Frenchman in the mirror sticks the barrel of the Thompson in his mouth and blows himself OUT OF FRAME just as... ...the front door bursts open and the FBI AGENTS surround Nick.
sheeni,"Write often, Nickie."
nick,"I will, darling."
sheeni,And don't worry about Albert. He'll be waiting for you too.
