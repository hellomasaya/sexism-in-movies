grug,Eep would you come down here? You're being so dramatic.
grug,"No, I mean, you're already out now."
grug,"Never mind, Thunk. Just, come out."
thunk," Uhh, but if you don't give the signal, how do I know you're my dad?"
grug,"The signal isn't so you know it's me, it's so you know I wasn't eaten by an animal."
thunk,"Then why is the signal an animal noise? I mean, doesn't that just confuse things?"
grug,Sigh. Hoo hooooo! Hoo hooooo!
ugga,"Mom, we're ready to leave.  Mom!"
grug,It's still early.
gran,And you're still fat.
grug,Breakfast formation!

gran, Aaaaaaaaaah.
grug,Is she still out there?
ugga,"You know she hates the cave, Grug."
eep,Please come back tomorrow.
grug,How can she not like the cave? It's so cozy.
ugga,"It is a little, dark, Grug."
grug,It's not that dark.
grug,Come on.
grug,That was too close!
eep,I was watching. I was fine.
grug,"What were you doing up there, Eep?"
eep,I don't know.
grug,What were you looking for?
eep,Nothing.
grug,Well then why did you go up there?
eep, I don't know. GRUG Why don't you know? Stop looking for things. Fear keeps us alive Eep. Never not be afraid.
eep, What's the point of all this?
grug,Hmmm? What was that?
eep," I mean, why are we here? What are we doing this for?"
croods,GROAN
grug,No one said survival was fun.
eep,Nothing is fun.
grug,Hmm? Would you come down here. Eep?
ugga,Grug. Off.
grug,Yes.
ugga,Off!
grug,I just don't see why she needs her own ledge. That's all. That's what this is about.
ugga,She's working through some things and needs her own space.
grug,What things? How long is this going to take? Really? I mean she already doesn't listen to me.
ugga,See? She's listening.
grug,"If she wants to survive, she has to follow our rules."
ugga,How about a story? Eep loves those.
grug," That's a good idea ... How about a story, huh?"
thunk,"Oh yeah, tell us a story."
grug,Ok. Can I borrow that? Thank you. Eep! Your old favorite?
eep,I haven't played with that thing in years.
grug,Tonight we'll hear the story of Krispy Bear.
ugga,Grug!
grug,"Yes. And one day, while she was in a tree, the curious little bear wanted to climb to the top."
thunk,Wha?
grug,"And no sooner than she climbed to the top, she saw something new and died."
thunk,Just like that?
grug,Yes! Her last moments of terror still frozen on her face.
gran,"Oh, same ending as everyday."
thunk," I get it, dad. I get it. I will never do anything new or different."
grug,"Good man, Thunk."

eep,"No! It's mine. No, no. I caught it!"
guy,It's dying. I can fix it!
eep,It does what you tell it?
guy,"Well, yeah, sort of."
eep,The sun?

eep,Make some for me.
guy,"Ow. Okay, it doesn't come out of me."
eep,Make. MAKE! MAKE IT!

eep,Are you dead? Can I have your fire if you're dead?
guy,"Hey, those are cold!"
belt,Squirf!
guy,"You think? Listening shells, activate."
eep,I don't even know you.
guy, Ow. I'm Guy.

eep,What?
guy,I'm calling it...  The... End.
belt,Da da daaaaa.
eep,How do you know?
guy,"I've seen it. It's coming this way. First, the Earth is going to shake. Then it breaks open. Everything falls in. Fire. Lava. I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but Aaaaaaaugh. Believe me, everything we're standing on, all this right here, will be gone."
eep,I can't.
guy,"Okay. Here. If you survive, call me."
eep,Thank you. Hello? Hey!
grug,Are you hurt? What took you?
eep,Nothing. I left on my own.
grug,"You... youuuuuuu... ww-what!? EEP Dad, let me explain..."
grug,You're grounded.
grug,Hey!
ugga,Eep!
eep,Mom!
ugga,Grug! What happened!?
grug,"You know what, I am so mad right now, that I can't talk to her."
ugga,Eep?
eep,You'll never believe it. I found something new.
croods,New?!!!! The Croods all SNATCH up stones. They form a defensive circle.
grug,New's a big problem!
eep,Wait. Wait!
ugga,Eep. Stay inside the family kill circle.
eep,It wasn't bad.
grug,New is always bad.
eep,No. He was nice.
grug,What!? Excuse me? He?
eep,"Oh. Well, I thought he was a warthog, but then he turned into a boy."
gran,Strange. Usually it's the reverse.
thunk,Eep's got a boy hog! Eep's got a boy hog!
eep,"There was a boy. Watch, okay. I'm gonna call him."
grug,It was dangerous.
eep, It was beautiful. You want to see dangerous? Here.
thunk,Owww! My sniffer!
grug,"Okay Eep, that's it. We're going back to the cave and you're going to stay in there until you're older than... her!"
eep,What!? You can't keep me inside forever!
grug,Get to the cave! GO!
ugga,"Yes. Grug, the cave, it's gone."
grug,No.
eep,You really need to see this...
grug,No. No one is going anywhere.
ugga,Grug?
grug,Just go! Go! Go!
grug,"One, two, three, four, five -- BEAT. Grug smiles."
gran, Oh... Where are we?
grug,"I don't know, I'm not sure. Down. In a lower place. One thing's for sure, we can't go back the way we came."
sandy,Sniff sniff sniff Grrrrrrrrrrr.....
ugga, Sandy? What is it?
grug,"No, no! Come back, Sandy!"
thunk," If it was me, I'm just throwing this out there, if it was me choosing the cave, I would go with a smaller cave."
grug,Wait.
thunk,Dad?
grug,I'll take care of this.
thunk,"Alright dad, go get `em! Oh, oh, now you got em-- Now they're really hitting you. Dad I got it, just stop running into their fists."
gran,"Hah, I'm loving this."
ugga,"Grug, when you're done, we should get going."
grug,That's right! You can't get past this!
chunky,ROOOAR!
croods,GASPS
grug,Climb! Climb! Climb!
thunk,Hey look! This cave has a tongue. Awesome!
grug,"Okay, that's one, two, three, four, five... six..."
gran,And seven... if we're counting Chunky the Death Cat.
chunky,Grrrrrrrrr.
thunk,Hah! It's scared of the dark... wait... we're scared of the dark.
grug,Kill circle!
guy,Ta-da. EEP 
grug,Auughhauhhhgggh!
croods,"Raaarr, grOooOOOOowwllll, ERF ERF GLaaabbbllllellelller!"
guy,Cavies!
eep,Cavies?
guy,"Cavemen! Stand back! They're practically animals. See their bony, sloping foreheads?"
eep,Oh... yeah!
guy,The huge primitive teeth?
eep,Er... yeah...
guy,"The excessive body hair? Oh, that one's got a tail..."
eep,Uhhh... yeah...
eep, They're my family.
guy,What?
thunk,"Ah, the sun is in his hands!"
eep,"No. No. It's ""fire."""
ugga,Where did it come from?
eep, He made it.
grug,Make some for me!
eep,It doesn't come out of him.
grug,Make. Make it.
guy,"You know, you're a lot like your daughter."
eep,"Great, now he's broken."
grug,Whoa! Stay back. We don't know what it wants.
thunk,"Dad, Sandy's hurting fire."
grug,Sandy! No! Fire is not a play thing!
ugga,"Aww, what a cute little guy."
grug,"Hey, stay back."
grug,"Thunk! Uh, try hiding from it in the tall dry grass!"
thunk," Stop please, please. I'm only nine."
ugga,"Ooh, more fire babies."
eep,Hi.
guy,"So, your Dad, he's trying to kill me. EEP Yeah. But I won't let him."
thunk,I don't like you anymore!
sandy,Weeeee!!!!
gran,Get out! Out!
ugga,"Eat up, babies!"
gran,Die! Die!
eep,They're not so scary once you get to know them.
guy,Who are you people?
ugga,"Oh, I'm sorry. We're the Croooooods! And you are?"
guy,"Uh, Guy."
croods," Hi, Guy."
thunk,Wow! Looks like magic. And smells like food.
grug,"Don't eat it, it's new."
croods,Still alive!
belt,Squirf!
guy,gasping for air 
eep,"Hey, where's Guy?"
guy,No!
eep,Going somewhere?
guy,"The mountain? High ground? End of the world, remember?"
eep,That already happened. It destroyed our cave.
guy, Noooo. That was just the beginning of the end. The end of the end is still coming.
grug, Eep. Drop it.
eep,We can't let him go! What if we don't find a cave before sunset? What if it takes a few days? What if the birds come back?
gran,"We need his fire, dummy!"
grug,Fine. You're staying with us till we find a cave.
guy,"What? No I'm not. Don't make me part of this. Stay here if you want, but let me go. I've got a dream, a mission, a reason to live."
eep, Not anymore.
guy, Umm... I've got an idea. Let's go to that mountain.
grug, It's too far.
eep,Dad really has his heart set on a cave.
guy,"Uh, there, are, caves on that mountain."
eep,Have you been there?
guy,It's a mountain. Mountains are safe. Mountains have caves. And water. And sticks.
thunk,Mom? Did you hear that? I can get my own stick!
guy,Yes. Sticks. Caves and sticks. Crazy sticks. Let's go.
belt,Da da daaaaa.
thunk,Ugh. That thing is weird.
eep,"No no, it's okay Sandy. That's just a belt."
grug,"I've made a decision. We're going to, that mountain! Don't ask me why. It's just a hunch. It just feels right."
ugga,I don't know Grug. We've never really walked that far.
thunk,I don't think my feet can do that.
gran,I'll never live long enough to get there.
grug, We'll become closer as a family.
thunk,Aaaaaaaaugh. Get her off. Get off.
ugga,"If you're not ready to challenge her, then don't look her in the eye."
gran,Could you keep your big giant arms on your side of the trail!
ugga,No more touching. No more touching.
eep,Isn't this fun? We're taking our first trip together.
grug,Do you want me to turn this family around? Do you?! Because I will turn this family around so fast!
thunk,"Dad, I gotta go!"
grug,"Come on, you can hold it."
thunk,I don't think so.
grug, Go behind one of those lumpy things and make it fast.
thunk,Ow! Something bit me!
gran, I don't blame it.
ugga,Maybe we should have stopped for water.
eep,"Dad, can I take a turn carrying him?"
grug,No.
eep,How about now?
grug,No.
eep,Now? GRUG No.
eep,NOW?!?!
grug,NO!
eep, NOW?!?!
grug,"I can do this all day long. No, no, no, and still no."
gran,I'm not dying on an empty stomach.
ugga,"Grug, we're all pretty tired."
thunk,"I'm pretty dizzy, so I'm just going to lay down for a minute."
grug,We'll eat when we get there.
gran,It's taking too long! I'm grabbing a snack.
guy,"No. No. No. Don't do that. He will cut you. That's not food, he's a pet. My pet."
gran,What's a pet? GUY An animal that you don't eat.
gran,We call those children.
grug,"No man should have a pet. It's weird, and wrong. It's--  ...It's food!"
guy,"No, no please!"
grug,Not that. That.
grug,Food fixes everything.
thunk,Arrgh.
grug,Not you! You're still grounded!
thunk,My feet hurt.
guy,You look tense.
eep,I'm not tense.
gran,Angry girl wants to be doing what they're doing.
thunk,Ow! I wasn't ready!
thunk,Why are you doing this?
guy,What are they doing?
ugga,Hunting.
thunk,Get it off! You stay away from me.
guy,"No seriously, what are they doing?"
thunk, You've got a ton of eggs. Just make another egg!
grug,There! Who's hungry for scorpion?
guy,What happened to the egg and the bird?
thunk," You know, we lost him. But when the bird stepped on me and pushed me into the ground, the scorpion grabbed a hold of me and one thing led to another and here we are eating him. Win win."
gran,Not enough. Not enough. I need more. I need more!
guy," Oh, look at that. She's not gonna eat me right?"
ugga,You're too skinny. If she was gonna eat anyone it would be--
thunk,AAAAAAAAAUUGHHHHHHHH!
ugga,Mom!
grug,Hold her still. Use a rock. Ugga would you just hit her legs.
eep,Why are you rolling away?
guy,Owww! I just want something to eat.
eep,You have bug for dinner. Plenty of bug!
guy,Please... I'll let you help me hunt.
eep,Really?
thunk,Ahhh! They're all over me... Tell my story...
guy,Okay. Guy carefully SETS the trigger.
eep,What do you call this?
guy,A trap.
eep,What does it do?
guy," soft whistle Raargh, Thump thump thump, thubububububub soft whistle poom! Tadaaaaaa!"
eep,How long have you been alone?
guy,How's your acting?
eep,"Just move your arm... no, your other arm. Oh, that one's mine."
guy,"Yeah, I noticed."
grug,Where's Eep?
guy,She's awesome.
grug,Eep!
eep,"Dad, no!"
thunk,It's an avalanche of flavor.
guy, Looks like we won't be having any leftovers.
eep,"What are ""left-overs?"""
guy," You know, when you have so much food to eat you have some, left over."
eep,We never have that much food.
ugga,"Grug, how about a story?"
grug,That's a good idea. How about a story huh?
thunk,"Yeah a story, tell us a story!"
grug,"Once upon a time there was a little tiger who lived in a cave with her family. There were a lot of rules, but the big, simple one was to never leave the cave at night. And the door was so heavy, you'd think it would be easy to remember."
thunk,So easy to remember!
grug,"I know! But, while everyone was asleep, she went out anyway."
croods,No!
grug,"Yes! And no sooner than she did, her cave was destroyed and everyone had to go on this long, sucky walk, with some weirdo they met, and died! The end."
guy,Whoa! I did not see that coming. Twist ending. My stories never end like that.
thunk,Yes! Two stories in one night!
guy,"Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's. Um, once upon a time, there was a beautiful tiger. She lived in a cave with the rest of her family. Her father and mother told her, ""You may go anywhere you want but never go near the cliff, for you could fall."""
grug,And die. Good story.
guy,"But when no one was looking, she would go near the cliff, for the closer she came to the edge, the more she could hear, the more she could see, the more she could feel. Finally, she stood at the very edge, and she saw a light. She leaned out to touch it, and slipped."
grug,And she fell.
guy,And she flew.
croods,GASP
thunk,Where did she fly?
guy,Tomorrow.
eep,Tomorrow?
guy,A place with more suns in the sky than you can count.
thunk,It would be so bright.
guy,"A place not like today, or yesterday, a place where things are better."
grug,"Tomorrow isn't a place, you can't see it!"
guy,"Oh yes, yes it is. I've seen it. That's where I'm going."
grug,"Well, WE are going to shut our eyes and sleep. And when we wake up we're going to find the place that has everything we want."
eep,Tomorrow?! GRUG A cave.
grug,"snoring, tossing and turning"
guy,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHH.
guy,That was too close. It almost caught us.
grug,I was watching. We were fine.
guy,"We've got to move faster. Do you people have any other speed aside from ""wander?"" I'll take a shamble at this point."
eep,"Hey, do you have a minute? How did the tiger fly?"
guy,I only share when I'm outside the log. I'm funny that way.
eep, Leave this to me.
grug,He's loose!
thunk,You mean these rocks? Ahh owww! Do not step on these rocks!
gran,"Step aside, girls!"
gran,"Well, there goes our chance for survival."
thunk,And our log!
grug,Okay. Arraugh!
guy,"Ow, ow, ow."
thunk,"Ow! Jumping doesn't help, I mean, just briefly, but it doesn't get better! Ow! Do not walk on your hands, the hands do not help at all."
belt,Eeccoomme on!
guy,"I can help you, but we're going to have to make a few changes around here. The log ride is over. Drop the log."
grug,"Okay, smart, Guy... now what?"
thunk,Ahhhh! Good fish.
guy,Okay. Now you can look.
eep,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh! I love them! Where are my feet!? GUY They're still there!
eep,"Oh, okay."
guy,Whoa. You're really  ... heavy.
eep,Really? Thank you!
grug,"Hey, wait. Whoa. Whoa. WHOA!!"
guy, Okay! She's up. I'm good. We're good...
gran,These shoes are great! Where do you get these ideas?
guy,Ah ha.
thunk,Dad. I don't have a brain.
grug,We've gotten along just fine without brains till now. Cavemen don't need brains. We have these. Heeya! Haha!  That's what I'm talking about! Ideas are for weaklings. Grug punches at the air in front of Guy making him wince.
thunk,Good fish. Don't eat my feet.
eep,So... How'd the tiger fly?
guy,He jumped on the sun and rode it to tomorrow.
grug,"No, no, no! The family moves across, Grug is the last to follow."
thunk,Hi dad! Bye dad!
guy,You've seen rain before... right?
eep,We don't get out much.
belt,Hmmmmm. Belt makes an Origami boat. He and Sandy sail across the rain puddles.
grug," Eep, looks dangerous."
eep,"Oh dad, you say that about everything."
guy,Careful.
eep,Oh really? Okay.
grug,Augh! No no no! Not cool. Not cool. Not cool.
guy,"So the bear says, ""Your cave?"" I've been dumping my bones here since last week."
gran,"Last week, haha. That's a funny story!"
guy,It's not a story! It's a joke.
gran,What's a joke?
guy,"You know, just making something up... to make you laugh."
gran,"Hah, I don't get it."
guy,"Here you go, one for you, and this ones for you."
thunk,Thanks.
grug,Okay. Okay. That's enough. I don't see why the kids need their own shells.
guy,"So if anyone gets in trouble, we can call the others."
grug,Wait-- you're saying we should split up?
guy,We can try more paths at once. It's the fastest way through.
grug,Croods stick together.
guy,They can handle it.
eep,"We can do it, dad."
grug,No no no no no. It's my job to keep you safe. I'm still in charge and we are not splitting up.  Except for you two. And that's final.
guy,"Oh, hello."
grug, Hello? Is everyone alright?
ugga," We're okay, Grug."
thunk,Dad? I'm freaking out a little bit. Just tell me what to do. Just what do I do right now?
grug,Stay where you are. I'll find you.
guy,"No. Too slow. Everybody, keep moving forward and we'll get out."
thunk,Dad?
grug, Yeah. Okay.
thunk,It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna pass out.
eep,You dropped these.
thunk,"Here boy, catch!"
eep,Mom?
belt, Raaah raaah.
ugga,Grug?
thunk,"Good boy. Whose my good boy? You need a name, you want a name? I'm going to call you - Douglas. Look at him. Can you do tricks? Roll over. Come on Douglas, roll over."
gran,"I was in love once. He was a hunter, I was a gatherer. It was quite a scandal. We fed each other berries. We danced.  Then my father smashed him with a rock and traded me to your Grandfather."
belt,Ha ha ha ha.
grug, Croods! Come get down here!
ugga,"Grug, they're okay. Guy's with them."
grug,"Oh, oh, `Guy'. `Guy' is with them. Well thank you for bringing me that interesting Guy update!"
ugga,"Oh, okay. I'm gonna go up and why don't you join us when you stop being a big drag!"
grug,"Sleep pile? How about a story, huh? Anyone?"
gran,"And then Torg said ""Know it? I drew it!"""
thunk,That makes no sense.
ugga," I know it was hard for you to bring us along, but they had the best day of their lives... Thank you for that."
guy,I want to show you something.
thunk,More suns in the sky than you can count.
guy,"Every sun that crosses our sky, comes to rest up there."
eep,Tomorrow.
guy,That's where we'll be safe.
eep,I'm going with Guy.
grug, No. Not my little girl.
eep,Come with us.
ugga,I can't go without Grug.
gran,"Well, that makes one of us. Count me in!"
ugga,Really Mom? Now?
gran,"Grug has no idea how to protect us. In fact, he has no ideas at all."
ugga,"No, that's not true. What about that one time when he a..."
gran,"Face it! If he actually had an idea of his own I'd, I'd have a heart attack and die!"
on grug,Grug smiles to himself.
ugga,Grug?
thunk,Dad?
eep,Dad?
guy,He's a big guy. How can he just disappear like that?
thunk,Hey wait. Let's ask that ugly lady if she's seen dad.
uga,Yeah.
grug,Haven't seen him.
ugga,Augh!
grug," Yeah, Wow. Like, I was up all night cuz like all these, ideas just kept coming to me."
guy,Is that a snake?
grug,Belt! New and improved! It's even self- tightening. Ow!
ugga,What is that on your head?
gran,It's called desperation.
grug," I call it a ""rug."" Rhymes with Grug. And this one. I call it a ""ride."" Rhymes with Grug."
guy,"That, doesn't--"
grug,It's gonna get us places faster than shoes.
thunk,I wish I had a ride.
grug,"Painting is a thing of the past. I call this, a ""snap-shot."""
thunk,Let's do it again. I think I blinked.
grug,"I call them ""shades."""
thunk,The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore! Where do you get these great ideas?
grug,"Since I don't have a brain, they're coming from my stomach. Down deep below, and then up again into my mind."
guy,Grug. We have to keep moving.
grug,"See, I got ideas, I got thoughts."
eep,Mom?
ugga,I know. It's bad.
gran,I almost feel sorry for him.
ugga,What are you trying to do Grug?
grug,"I thought if I could have ideas like Guy, maybe Eep would listen to me. Maybe she wouldn't want to go with Guy."
ugga,"Oh Grug, is that what this is all about?"
guy,We're here.
grug,"Cave! Everyone inside. Come on! Hurry up, let's go. Go, go."
eep,No.
ugga," No more caves, Grug."
grug,What?
gran,We're gonna jump on the sun and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy.
grug,"Wait, so you're all going to do this?"
thunk,"Sorry, dad."
eep,You have to stop worrying for all of us. GRUG It's my job to worry. It's my job to follow the rules.
eep,The rules don't work out here.
grug,They kept us alive.
eep,"That wasn't living, that was just, not dying. There's a difference."
grug,"Ugga, everyone, you have to listen to me."
eep,We would be dead if we listened you.
grug,Guy?
ugga,"Guy, run."
grug,AAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
guy,This is pointless. We're running out of time. Everything is collapsing. You're being irrational and counterproductive.
grug,Big words anger me. Keep talking.
guy,Countermeasures.
grug,I... am... a... CAVEMAN.
guy,"No, no, no wait."
grug,Hnnnnnngh! No. What is this stuff that saves you from my punches?
guy, Tar.
grug,No. I have to get back to them.
guy,Grug! Stop!
grug,Your...?
guy,Family. Yeah.
grug,Sorry.
guy,"I was little when it happened. The last thing my parents told me was, ""Don't hide. Live. Follow the Sun. You'll make it to Tomorrow."""
grug,You followed the light. My daughter is a lot like you.
guy,No. She's like you. She loves you but always forgets to say it. Just like you forget to tell her.
grug, I guess I was just busy keeping them all alive.
guy,It's okay. That's what Dads do.
guy,"Belt! Emergency Idea Generator, activate!"
belt,TA-DAAAAA
grug,Wow.
guy,"Yeah, I know. But he's doing the best with what he has. Let's go."
grug,Scared? I'll show you scared. Hand me those acting sticks!

grug,Take us to Tomorrow.
guy,Hurry! Come on. We're gonna make it!
eep,You were right.
guy,There it is. The sun. We can do it! We can ride it to Tomorrow.
ugga,"We have to go back to the cave. Hurry, hurry, stay together. Let's keep moving. Move, move! Everybody hold my hand. Thunk let's go. Go! Let's stay together."
grug,No more dark. No more hiding. No more caves.
ugga,No. We don't know what's over there. Maybe nothing. It's too risky.
grug,It's a chance.
guy,I'll take that chance.
grug,"You know, I've wanted to throw you away ever since I met you."
guy,"Heh. That's a joke, right?"
grug,What's a joke?
ugga,He made it... He made it...
grug,"Okay, Thunk. Your turn."

ugga,You did good.
sandy,Daddy.
grug,Gran.
gran,"No mush, just throw me."
grug,Time to go.
eep,No. I have too much to say to you. I need to fix everything and I don't have time.
grug,I can fix it.
eep,This works good. What do you call it?
grug,I was thinking of calling it a Hug.  Because it rhymes with Grug. But you can change it if you want.
eep,"No. I like a ""Hug."""
grug,I love you.
eep,I...
grug,Never be afraid.
guy,There. I see him!
grug," Hey, I did it."
grug,They're in trouble. Hang on! I'm coming.
macawnivore,Erm?
grug,Run! Grug leaps onto the Macawnivore's back as the birds move in closer. The ground begins to break up violently as lakes empty themselves and entire forests turn sideways.
guy,It's not safe here.
gran,I'll tell her.
eep,I never got to tell him.
ugga,"Eep, if your Dad were here, he would tell YOU TO--"
thunk,"Wow, you sound just like him."
sandy,Daddy! EEP He did it!
guy,He's riding the Sun... but not very well. Everybody out of the way!
thunk,Dad!
ugga,Grug!
grug,Ahhh! Where's the danger? Who blew their shell?
eep,I love you too.
grug,"One, two, three, four, five, six..."
belt,Eerrghh.
grug,And a half.
thunk,Douglas! Dad you saved him!
grug,"Well, a boys gotta have a pet."
eep,You really need to see this.
grug,We should go there.
eep,Our world is still plenty harsh and hostile. But now we know the Croods will make it.
grug,Release the baby!
eep,"Well, sort of."
