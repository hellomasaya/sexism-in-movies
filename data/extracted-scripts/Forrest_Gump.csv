Speaker,Dialogue
forrest,Hello. My name's Forrest Gump.
forrest,You want a chocolate?
forrest,"I could eat about a million and a half of these. My momma always said, ""Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."""
forrest,Those must be comfortable shoes. I'll bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing. I wish I had shoes like that.
black woman,My feet hurt.
forrest,Momma always says there's an awful lot you could tell about a person by their shoes. Where they're going. Where they've been.
forrest,I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I think about it real hard I could remember my first pair of shoes.
forrest,Momma said they'd take my anywhere.
doctor,"All right, Forrest, you can open your eyes now. Let's take a little walk around."
doctor,"How do those feel? His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump. As strong as I've ever seen. But his back is as crooked as a politician."
doctor,"But we're gonna straighten him right up now, won't we, Forrest?"
principal,"Your boy's... different, Mrs. Gump. Now, his I.Q. is seventy-five."
principal,"I want to show you something, Mrs. Gump. Now, this is normal."
principal,"Forrest is right here. The state requires a minimum I.Q. of eighty to attend public school, Mrs. Gump. He's gonna have to go to a special school. Now, he'll be just fine."
principal,We're a progressive school system. We don't want to see anybody left behind.
principal,"Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?"
principal,"Well, your momma sure does care about your schooling, son. Mm-mm-mm."
principal,"You don't say much, do you?"
forrest,"Momma, what's vacation mean?"
forrest,Where Daddy went?
elvis presley," ""Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit, and you ain't no friend of mine."""
elvis,"Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am. I was just showin' him a thing or two on the guitar here."
elvis,"Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you, ma'am."
elvis,"Say, man, show me that crazy little walk you just did there. Slow it down some."
elvis," ""You ain't nothin' but a hound, hound dog..."""
elvis," ""...cryin' all the time"""
elvis," ""You ain't nothin' but a hound dog..."""
elvis, You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...
elvis, You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...
elvis," ""Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit and you ain't no friend of mine."""
forrest,"Must be hard being a king. You know, it's funny how you remember some things, but some things you can't."
forrest,"I sure will, Momma."

jenny,Just stay a little longer.
forrest,"Okay, Jenny. I'll stay."

jenny,Run away! Hurry!
jenny,"Run, Forrest! Run!"
jenny,"Run, Forrest!"
jenny,"Run, Forrest! Run!"

chet huntley, Federal troops enforcing a court order integrated the University of Alabama today.
chet huntley,Governor George Wallace had carried out his symbolic threat to stand in the schoolhouse door.
governor wallace,We hereby denounce and forbid this illegal and unwarranted action by the central government.
katzenbach," Governor Wallace, I take it from that, uh..."
katzenbach,"...statement that you are going to stand in that door, and that you are not going to carry out the orders of this court, and that you are going to resist us from doing so. I would ask you once again to responsibility step aside and if you do not, I'm going to assure you..."
forrest,"Earl, what's going on?"
earl,Coons are tryin' to get into school.
forrest,"Coons? When raccoons try to get on our back porch, Momma just chase 'em off with a broom."

newsman," ...block the doorway, President Kennedy ordered the Secretary of Defense then to use the military force."
newsman,"Here by videotape is the encounter by General Graham, Commander of the National Guard, and Governor Wallace."
governor wallace,"We must have no violence today, or any other day, because these National Guardsmen are here today as Federal Soldiers for Alabamans. And they live within our borders and they are all our brothers. We are winning in this fight because we are awakening the American people to the dangers that we have spoken about so many times, just so evident today, the trend toward military dictatorship in this country."
newsman,And so at day's end the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa had been desegregated and students Jimmy Hood and Vivian Malone had been signed up for summer classes.
forrest,"Ma'am, you dropped your book. Ma'am."
chet huntley," Governor Wallace did what he promised to do. By being on the Tuscaloosa campus, he kept the mob from gathering and prevented violence."
assistant coach,"Say, wasn't that Gump?"

bubba,People call me Bubba. Just like one of them redneck boys. Can you believe that?
forrest,My name's Forrest Gump. People call me Forrest Gump.

drill sergeant,Gump! What's your sole purpose in this Army?
forrest,"To do whatever you tell me, Drill Sergeant!"

forrest,"Done, Drill Sergeant!"
drill sergeant,Gump!
drill sergeant,"Why did you put that weapon together so quickly, Gump?"
forrest,"You told me to, Drill Sergeant."
drill sergeant,"Jesus Christ! This is a new company record. If it wouldn't be a waste of such a damn fine enlisted man, I'd recommended you for O.C.S., Private Gump. You are gonna be a General some day, Gump! Now, disassemble your weapon and continue!"
bubba,"Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. There, uh, shrimp kabobs, shrimp creole..."

forrest,"Okay. Jenny, I'll write you all the time."
song,"""Some folks are born made to wave the flag. Ooh, they're red, white and blue. And when the band plays ""Hail to the Chief,"" ohh, they point the cannon at you all. It ain't me. It ain't me. I ain't no Senator's son, no. It ain't me. It ain't me..."""
bubba,"Y'know, I bet there's shrimp all in these waters. They tell me these Vietnams is good shrimp. You know, after we win this war, and we take over everything we can get American shrimpers to come on here and shrimp these waters. We'll just shrimp all the time, man. So much shrimp, why, you wouldn't believe it."

Hey, Forrest, there's somethin' I've been thinkin' about. I got a very important question to ask you. How would you like to go into the shrimpin' business with me?"
forrest,Okay.
bubba,"Man, I tell you what, I got it all figured out, too. So many pounds of shrimp to pay off the boat, so many pounds for gas, we can just live right on the boat. We ain't got to pay no rent. I'll be the captain; we can just work it together. Split everything right down the middle. Man, I'm tellin' you, fifty-fifty. And, hey, Forrest, all the shrimp you can get."
forrest,That's a fine idea.
song,"""There's something happenin' here. What it is ain't exactly clear. There's a man with a gun over there, telling' me I got to beware."""
