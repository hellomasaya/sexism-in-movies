Speaker,Dialogue
big,"I got a good feeling about this one, kid."
carrie,I've always loved this block.
big,How many does this make?
carrie,This is thirty-three.
big,Lucky thirty-three!
carol,The worst. I just left you a message.
carrie, Thirty-four. Lucky thirty-four?  Big looks over at her. She shrugs.
carrie,If anything else opens up let us know. We're very interested in this building.
agent,I do have another apartment that's not even on the market yet. Care to take a look?
agent,It's more than you were looking to pay.
carol,How much more?
agent,More.
big,"Oh, so this is where they keep the light."
carrie,Oh my God. I've died and gone to real estate heaven. Look at this place.
big,Must be the altitude.
agent,And across the rooftop terrace ---
carrie,What --   Nirvana?
agent,Your wife has quite a sense of humor.
carol, They're not married.
carrie,"No, he's my boyfriend."
agent,This way.
big,Aren't I a little old to be introduced as your boyfriend?
carrie,Point taken. From now on... you'll be my man friend.
big,Sounds like a dog.
carrie,"Well, if the shoe fits."
agent,And this is the master bedroom.
carrie,Hideous. Hate it. Hurts my eyes.
agent,Nasty divorce.
carrie,If you live here what is there to fight about?
agent,Yes. Small for a room this size. I know.
carrie,"Hmmm. Hmmm. Now, I understand the divorce."
big,I can build you a better closet.
carrie,Can we afford this?
big,I got it.
carrie,"""I got it."" Just like that. ""I got it"" -- like he was picking up the check for coffee or something."
charlotte,It sounds perfect.
carrie,Except for the closet which Big says he can redo -- also he says the kitchen needs work but I don't know about that `cause I keep sweaters in my stove.
miranda,"So, he bought it -- and you're going to live there with him?"
carrie,"Yes, together. That's right."
miranda,"But he'll own it. So. You are keeping your own place, right?"
carrie,"Oh, Miranda, please, I haven't figured out all the details yet, but I'm a smart girl and I'm sure I'll figure out something I'm comfortable with."
miranda,I just want to make sure you're being smart here --
carrie,And I love you for it -- but for now can't you stop worrying for me and just go ahead and feel what I want you to feel. Jealous.
miranda,Fine. I'm jealous. You're in real estate heaven and I'm in Brooklyn.
charlotte,New York magazine said Brooklyn is the new Manhattan.
miranda,Whoever wrote that - lives in Brooklyn.
carrie,There she is. Hey Hollywood!
samantha, Samantha Jones... Smith Jerrod's manager -- I'm in New York `till Monday.
samantha,Fabulous. Let's go in -- I am so excited!
yenta,Why the pushing?
samantha,There it is. My baby.
samantha,"When I saw this in the catalogue I said to Smith: This flower ring is the essence of me. One of a kind, filled with fire..."
carrie,And a little too much.
samantha,Exactly. Come on. Let's go spend some of my hard-earned Hollywood money.
miranda,Hey -- what's coming up on Smith's series? Is he going to sleep with that new blonde neurosurgeon?
samantha,He sleeps with every hot woman doctor in that hospital.
miranda,Great. Can't wait.
charlotte,Don't you ever get weirded out by seeing Smith in bed with all those other women?
samantha,"No, I think it's hot. Sometimes, when I'm alone, I masturbate right along with them."
carrie,And people say the golden age of television is over.
samantha,"Besides, it's fake sex. When they're doing it -- no one's actually turned on."
miranda,Kinda like Steve and I.
auctioneer,Next item. The flower ring.
auctioneer,Let's start the bidding at ten thousand.
samantha,Bitch.
carrie,And the gloves are off.
auctioneer,Do I hear twenty?
miranda,She's bidding for someone on the phone.
charlotte,That's not fair.
auctioneer,Thirty-five. Forty?
samantha,I deserve this. I work hard.
auctioneer,Do I hear forty?
samantha,Sex with only one man for I don't know how long.
auctioneer,Do I hear fifty thousand?
samantha, Fifty fucking thousand!
auctioneer,Fifty-five?
samantha, I draw the line at fifty.
charlotte,I thought this auction would be more fun... but it's kinda sad.
samantha,... Till they weren't
big,The creatures are ready. Just gonna sit there?
carrie,"I'm not sitting, I'm thinking."
big,Here. Husk and think.
carrie,I'm thinking I'm going to sell my apartment and put the money towards heaven on Fifth.
big,Why? You love your place.
carrie,I know but --
big,But what?
carrie,We're together ever night -- so I'm basically paying a mortgage on a glorified closet.
big,You write there. It's your office.
carrie,There's plenty of room at the new place and -- besides.. I want to make us -- a life there. I want it to be ours.
big,It is ours. I bought it for us.
carrie,"And that's so amazing --but you bought it, so it's really your place. And -- if anything were to happen..."
big,What's going to happen?
carrie,"I have to be smart here. I mean, we're not married and I'd have no legal rights to... this home that I built... with you."
big,Did you want to get married?
carrie,I didn't think it was an option.
big,"Well, Mr. Bradshaw, what if it was an option?"
carrie,"Well, people are always assuming we are."
big,And you know what happens when people assume. They make an ass out of who?
carrie,You and me.
big,"What do you think, kid?"
carrie,Why -- Do you want to get married?
big,"Well, I wouldn't mind be married to you. Would you mind being married to me?"
carrie,"No, if that's what you want. Is that what you want?"
big,I want you. So. Okay.
carrie,Okay. Really? We're getting married.
big,We're getting married.  Should we get you a diamond?
carrie,"No, please, don't get me a diamond.  Get me a really big closet."
big,"Deal.  He puts out his hand. She takes it and they shake.  BIG  But... You gotta do better on that corn. Look at all the stuff left on there.  She looks down at her corn, he's right. She nods. "
carrie,"So, the other night, Big and I were talking about, you know, moving in together and our future..."
miranda,... and I'm deaf.
carrie,Everyone's looking
charlotte,"Sorry! I'm sorry... but my friend here, just got engaged and she's been going out with the man for ten years."
carrie,I am mortified.
miranda,There is literally a ringing in my ear.
samantha,Samantha Jones--
carrie,Well... I made a little decision that I hope you'll be happy about.
samantha,"Oh, honey... you finally got Botox."
carrie,No. I did not get Botox
samantha,"I'm telling you, Carrie -- you'll love it."
carrie,I did not call to talk about Botox.
samantha,I'm just saying.
carrie,"So... Last week, after the auction, I started thinking about my options."
samantha,Right.
carrie,"Right, and... well, Big and I decided to get married."
samantha,Really?
carrie,Yes.
samantha,That's great.
carrie,You sounded more excited about the botox.
samantha,"Well, honey -- I am excited for you but -- you know me... I don't really believe in marriage.... Botox on the other hand -- That works every time."
carrie,Hello?
samantha,"I think I was in shock. I mean, it's you getting married. This is not some random person -- it's you."
carrie,I hear ya.
samantha,"And I guess, I thought that after that big mess with Aidan -- you'd never want to get married."
carrie,I know.
samantha,"So, I put you in my ""we're never getting married"" file. Now, I've got to take you out of that file."
carrie,Sorry about the extra paper work.
samantha,You'll get my bill.
carrie,"Samantha, it feels so different this time. No clich romantic kneeling down on one knee. Just you know, two grown-ups -- making a decision about spending their lives together."
samantha,"Well, I'm happy for you."
carrie,And one more thing... I want you to be maid of honor. How do you feel about that?
samantha,The same way you feel about Botox. Painful and unnecessary.
anthony,"Seventy five sounds better. ""A small, wedding of seventy five guests."""
anthony,Cut throat -- I love it. I hope you're that decisive when it comes to the location and the dress.
carrie,Oh. I found the dress.
charlotte,What?! When?
carrie,The other day. I have it here.
anthony,This is going to be good!
charlotte,I'm so excited!
charlotte,"No, it's pretty but it's so -- simple."
carrie,Simple and classic. When I saw it I just thought: That is what I should marry Big in.
anthony,"Well, who's it by? The label?"
carrie,No one. I found it in a vintage shop.
anthony,"""The bride wore a dress by no one."""
carrie," Don't worry, I'll style it up with shoes."
anthony,The invitation is fancier than the dress.
miranda,Where is he with the check?
steve,"Geese, Miranda -- relax. Magda's not even finished yet."
miranda,I still have a legal brief to work on when I get home.
brady,I have to go to the bathroom.
magda,"I'll take him. Wash that beautiful face too, yes?"
miranda,What? I'm sorry. I'm exhausted. Brady woke me up at five AM.
steve,He woke me up too.
miranda,It's like you're always criticizing me.
steve,I am not.  You want to go through life with foam on your lip and no one telling you?
miranda,Yeah. Yeah.
steve,Wait --- wait -- Don't come already...
miranda,Yeah. Yeah.
steve,"Wait, wait -- get on top.    Get on --"
miranda,It's late... let's just get it over with.
steve,We never have sex and you want to get it over with?
miranda,Steve... We have sex.
steve,When was the last time we had sex?
miranda,How often do you guys have sex?
charlotte,Miranda -- please.
miranda,What?
carrie,"It's okay, I know all about sex."
samantha,"If I knew the girl talk was going to be on ""lock down,"" I wouldn't have flown two thousand miles. "
charlotte,"No, we can talk, let's just not use that word."
miranda,"She's three, she doesn't know what it means. I'm forty- two and I still don't know what it means."
charlotte,"I know, but she's repeating everything."
miranda,Fine. How often do you guys...
carrie,"... ""Color""?"
charlotte,Thank-you.
samantha,"Well, I can't color enough. I would color all day -- every day if I had my way. I'd use every crayon in my box."
carrie,We get it. You love to color.  Why are you asking?
miranda,"Steve and I were ""coloring"" last night and just as I was about to --"
samantha,Come?  Sorry -- there is no crayon equivalent.
miranda,"He wanted to change positions and I said... ""Let's just get it over with."""
samantha,And this is bad?
miranda,It is when you have a full-time job.
samantha,I have a full-time job.
miranda,"Well, you don't also have a five year old and play groups and PTA and a mother-in-law in a rest home with advancing Alzheimer's. I'm telling you, at the end of the day all I want to do is sleep. The most exciting thing in bed now -- is the bed."
carrie,So... Sleep is the new sex?
lily,Sex.
charlotte,See.
carrie,-- I meant coloring.
miranda,"We're just going through a no coloring phase -- it comes and goes, right?"
charlotte,Every couple is different. Harry and I --
miranda,Great. Now I feel worse.
samantha,"Well, when was the last time for you?"
miranda,Six months ago.
carrie,Oh my.
miranda,But that's a dry spell.
samantha,I bet it is.
charlotte,"What about you and Big, Carrie?  Come on, I told."
carrie,"Never. But, I will tell you this. When Big colors --  He rarely stays inside the lines."
miranda,"Well, this was very helpful."
samantha,Send it to Smith Jerrod at the office address.
smith,I've got a gift for you.
samantha,"So far, I like it."
smith,I knew how much you wanted it.
samantha,But I was going to buy it for myself.
smith,I wanted to give it to you... for our anniversary. We met five years ago today.
samantha, Right.
smith,Do you like it?
samantha,"To be clear -- This is a ring with diamonds -- not a diamond ring, right?  It's my second favorite thing I've ever found in there."
smith,Babe -- I've got to go to bed.
samantha,Bed? It's seven-thirty.
smith,I have to be at the studio by six A.M. and I need to get a workout before that.
samantha,This is how it starts. Next thing you know... we're only having sex three or four times a week.
smith,Most people consider that normal.
samantha,I am not most people.
smith,No - you most certainly are not.
carrie," John?  The terrace doors are open. The curtains blow, gently.   She walks out onto it."
carrie,Lean?
big,Are you the last person in New York still taking out library books?
carrie,I love the smell.
big,That's an old one.
carrie,"""The Love Letters of Great Men."" Volume one."
big,Am I in there?
carrie,"No, but some of your classmates are. Voltaire, Napoleon..."
big,You need to get glasses.
carrie,"No, I don't -- you have them.  ""My dearest Josephine, I wake consumed with thoughts of you --"""
big,Typical short guy. Gives it all away up front.
carrie,Research for my new book.
big,What's it about?
carrie,Love. I use to write about finding love-- now I want to write about what happens after you've found it.
big,Interesting. What happens?
carrie,Stay tuned.
big,"Bring it, Ludwig."
carrie," ""My thoughts go out to you today my immortal beloved. I can live only wholly with you or not at all."""
big,Good stuff.
carrie," ""Be calm my life, my all. Only by calm consideration of our existence can we achieve our purpose to live together. Oh continue to love me, never misjudge the most faithful heart of your beloved. Ever thine -- ever mine -- ever ours."
big,Does a love fax count?
carrie,When have I ever gotten a love fax?
big,I'm pretty sure my secretary sent one at some point.
carrie,"Yeah, yeah.... Put it in writing."
big,Alright. Here's a love letter from me to you.
delivery man,Which way's the wedding?
carrie,I've been thinking.
big,Again?
carrie,How about we get married at The New York Public Library?  Think how perfect. You and I and our love story surrounded by all the other lesser love stories.
big,Do we have to make that big of a deal?
carrie,It's not that big a deal. It's seventy-five people in a room that's partitioned in half.
big,It's just -- I've already had two big weddings.
carrie,"Well, what did you have in mind?"
big,"I don't know -- a judge, couple friends and then we go for ham and eggs after."
carrie,Interesting.
big,Would we have to whisper? In the library?
elaine,"Carrie, hi!"
carrie,"Elaine, hi. Do you know John?"
elaine,"No, hi. Nice to meet you."
carrie,Elaine writes a single gal column for The New York Post.
elaine,Please -- I'd rather you reveal my weight.
carrie,Well. We're getting married.
big,Yep -- At the New York Public Library.
elaine,"Oh, my God! This gives me such hope."
charlotte," ""The ultimate single gal Carrie Bradshaw will be married in Manolos to New York financier John James Preston come fall."""
carrie, Our wedding's on Page Six.
big, Who would put that in there?
charlotte,"""Proving to single gals everywhere that there can be a happy ending over forty."""
carrie,"Oh, I know who."
stanford,"According to a certain trashy tome, you are marrying John James Preston."
carrie,Rumor has it.
stanford,Just one question: Does Big know?
carrie, Where are we eating?
stanford,Anywhere you like... and you know the rule -- the person on Page Six pays for lunch.
stanford,You forgot to charge us for the gaggle of gays.
bitsy,Carrie Bradshaw Preston! Carrie Bradshaw Preston!
enid,"We're putting together our annual ""Age"" issue -- and we'd like you to do forty."
carrie,Great. Who am I interviewing?
enid,No. You. You are forty. I want you to be featured in the magazine as the forty year old -- and here's the brilliant twist -- bride.
carrie,Wait -- I would be in the magazine?
enid,In bridal couture. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity - so spare me a week of faux soul-searching and just say yes.
carrie,Enid -- I'm so very flattered but--
enid,"Carrie. Vogue designers, Vogue photographers, Vogue airbrushing.  Nod your head: yes."
carrie,"Well, I'm hardly the last single girl."
enid,"No, but forty is the last age you can see a woman photographed in a wedding gown without the unintended Diane Arbus subtext."
carrie,"I thought the issue was ""great style at every age."""
enid,Style yes... bride no.
carrie, Enid -- I have no idea -- were you ever married?
enid,Briefly. In 1975. I wore Halston. Creme. One shoulder Grecian with a low-cut bodice to the waistline for a dramatic flair. The fabric in the sleeves formed oval draping on the sides. Stunning. My future husband and I saw it on a trip to Paris and he fell in love with it. 
carrie, Why didn't the marriage work out?
enid,Did you not hear me say my husband fell in love with my gown?  Has your fiance expressed any interest in what you'll be wearing?
carrie,None at all.
enid,Then you may have a shot.
samantha,She's looking quite at home for someone who didn't think she had the bride gene.
charlotte,"Well, I guess with the right man..."
stanford,... And the right dress.
big,Okay. Open them.
carrie,Double door. So far so good.
big,Like it?
carrie,Like it? It's love at first sight.
miranda,I can't believe it sold so fast.
charlotte,It's a sign.
carrie,"Yeah, a sign I priced it too low."
charlotte,Pink Post-it -- take. Purple -- toss. Yellow: Storage.
charlotte,Samantha! Oh my God!
carrie,What are you doing here?!
samantha,I lot of shit went down in this place. Attention must be payed!
mary,Who are you again?
miranda,"Oh, you know me -- I'm your daughter-in-law.  I'm Miranda."
mary,That's right.
miranda,While I run over to see your mother tomorrow maybe you can take him to the first birthday party alone. Then -- I'll meet you at the twins' party and you can leave and be at the bar by six.
steve,-- I had sex with someone else.
miranda,It's killing you?!
miranda,Do not follow me.
carrie,Hi.
miranda,Surprise -- Here we are!
carrie," Well, I'm so excited you are here for a sleepover."
miranda,We are too. Aren't we B-boy?
carrie,"Brady, do you want to go have some peanut butter?"
big,Peanut butter it is.
miranda,Apparently you don't have sex for six months he runs out and has it with some girl at his bar.
carrie,Steve. I can't believe it. Steve.
miranda,"Steve. When I think of everything I've done for him. And this is how he repays me. Man, if I didn't have Brady, I would never go back there."
steve,"Miranda, it's still me."
miranda,Is it?
miranda,"Yes, it's sad, but I'm not going to make it any sadder by staying at a bad hotel while I look for a place. Pass the salt."
carrie,I don't know if this question is allowed -- but how is Steve handling this?
miranda,Says he's devastated -- begs me to forgive him.  Not going to happen. I can barely even look at him.
charlotte,Steve -- I can't believe it.
carrie,That's what I said.
samantha,"Miranda, honey -- are you sure you want to do this? It's just one time. Anyone can have a slip."
miranda,"Well, even if I could get my head around that justification -- it's the cheating part -- the behind my back part... the violation of the trust -- that's the thing that's killing me."
brady,"Mommy, I want to go home."
charlotte,"Thank-you for being you.  He smiles, touched. She smiles -- he kisses her.  CARRIE  Charlotte made love to Harry five times that week."
samantha,"It's a little quick to move out, don't you think?"
smith,Her reaction is her reaction. Thanks Anaka.
samantha,He had sex once. Not even an affair.
smith,"Maybe it's not the sex. Maybe, it's the cheating. For me... that would be the thing. That it happened behind my back."
samantha,That's what she said.
smith,Look. I know we're not married but - - if you were going to have sex with someone else...
samantha,Are you waiting for me to get out my datebook?
smith," But... seriously, I'd rather know first."
samantha,You want me to tell you if I'm going to have sex? Fine. I'm about to have sex.
smith, Thanks Anaka.
miranda,I don't know if Steve's mentioned anything to you yet -- about us. Has he?
mary,Who's Steve?
carrie,Wedding crunch time. We need to really get serious here.
big,Not now -- I just got an email from the the contractor -- they pushed our move-in date again -- and I have to --
carrie,Nope. Wedding before contractor. Unless you're planning to invite him -- which would make the guest list two hundred and one.
big,"Two hundred? Jesus, Carrie -- it's gone up again?"
carrie,Blame the New York Post and Vogue. Two publications that have never before been uttered in the same sentence.
big,You said: seventy-five people in a partitioned-off room.
carrie,It's the dress. How can I explain this? It's like poker -- The dress upped the ante.
big,Change the dress.
carrie,"No, no, no -- you haven't seen this dress. This dress may be the whole reason to get married. Well, you and the dress."
big," Up, up. I have to finish this. Up."
carrie,Hey...
big,I don't have time for this.
carrie,This is our wedding and you're not taking it seriously.
big,"No, I'm not -- It's a circus! Two hundred people -- Page Six -- This is my third marriage -- how do you think it makes me look?"
carrie,I didn't know that was even an issue.  Why didn't you say anything sooner?
big,You wanted all this.
carrie,But -- don't you want --
big,"I want you, Carrie. That's what I want. I would have just gone down to city hall."
carrie,I think it's too late for city hall now.
big,"Well, no. I wasn't suggesting -- I was just saying."
carrie,You're a great man friend.
samantha,"Now, I know it's tradition at the rehearsal dinner for the maid of honor to reveal embarrassing things about the bride. But in our group --"
karl,There's a word he's heard before!
carrie,Who is that again?
big,Karl... a partner at the firm.
carrie,Karl's kind of a jerk.
karl, You know what they say -- three times a charm!
samantha," Hey ""dick wad""... I'm speaking."
carrie,Whooo!
samantha,"Now. There were times when we had our doubt about this gorgeous man. But after careful observation over the last hundred years, my doubts are over.  So... here's to the groom. A man who finally got ""Carrie-d"" away."
karl,"Here's hopin', John!"
carrie, Jackass.
big,"Quite a toast, Samantha."
samantha,"Well, you're quite a guy."
steve,I don't want to bother you all --
big,You're not bothering us.
steve,"But --- I need to talk to Miranda. Samantha, could you -- ask her to come out. I don't want to go in. It's a party and all."
miranda,Hi. I haven't talked to you all night.
samantha,Steve's here.
miranda,Could you give us --
steve,You didn't leave me any choice. You won't return my calls -- You only talk to me in front of the baby when you know I can't say anything.
miranda,What could you possibly have to say that could make it better?
steve,"Miranda, please... It was just that one time. Please -- I love you --"
miranda,You broke us! You broke us. What we had is broken!
big,Hey. Are you alright?
miranda,"No, I'm not alright. You two are crazy to get married. Marriage ruins everything."
carrie,There you are. I thought you skipped out on me.
big,Don't go. Spend the night with me.
carrie,Oh... One night won't kill you. And tomorrow you get to have me for the rest of your life.
big,I'm just tired -- I guess.
carrie,"Go home and sleep.  Now, give me a kiss good night. Make it good -- it's the last single girl kiss."
charlotte,I always knew she would marry Big.
charlotte,Yes I did! After every break-up I secretly thought: Nope. They belong together.
samantha,You thought that after the second break-up?
charlotte,Yep.
miranda,After the fifteenth?
carrie,Ha ha -- hilarious -- we broke up a lot.
samantha,"Yes, but... after the break-ups -- comes the hot make-up sex."
carrie,"You want to answer? Go ahead, sweetie... Open it up..."
lily,Sex.
carrie,"Sweetie, that was your first bootie call."
samantha,Are you sure she's not my child?
carrie,Hello?
big,It's me.
carrie,Oh my God -- did you just hear Lily?
big,Hey -- I need to talk.
carrie,It's Big. I'm gonna take it in the--
charlotte," Get some sleep, groomie!"
carrie,What's the matter?
big,It's just -- everything is great as it is.  I don't want to screw it up.
carrie,You won't.
big,I screwed it up twice before.
carrie,Here's the thing. This is me that you're marrying tomorrow. Me. Nobody else.
big,Yeah.
carrie,And I'm marrying you. It's me and you. And you want to know the good news there?
big,Yeah.
carrie,We've already both done everything we can to screw it up.
big,Yeah.
carrie,"Now, it sounds to me like you've got a bit of writer's block on the vow front."
big,Yeah.
carrie,"And I find - you know - as a professional writer- it's best to just, you know, stop thinking about it so much -- and go to bed. And in the morning..."
big,You know what to do?
carrie,"Exactly. And if not -- Just write this: ""I will love you."" Simple and to-the-point. And I swear I won't even try to take credit for it."
big,Okay. Good night.
carrie,I'll see you tomorrow. Hey. Me and you.
carrie,There you are! Almost lost you under all that. Got your purse?
anthony,Now there's a bride! Flowers!
carrie,Whose got a mirror?
charlotte,Behind you.
carrie,"Stanford, you're on my dress."
anthony,Get off the dress!
miranda,Is that a rip?
anthony, What?
big,"Can you put Carrie on, please?"
anthony,Not now... dress emergency.
samantha,There's so much fabric I can't see.
anthony,"Can't see anything behind this friggin' table. Go, go -- everyone out into the hall."
stanford,Don't call me a queen.
anthony,"Go -- Out in the hall, your highness."
big,Hello?
big,Why aren't you calling me back? I really need to talk to you. Call me back as soon as you get this.
stanford,Looks like someone had breakfast at Tiffany.
bitsy,"Sweetheart, look at the size... it's breakfast, lunch and dinner at Tiffany. "
anthony,We have a problem.
stanford,"I know, but for Carrie's sake I've decided to ignore your attitude."
anthony,"No, a real problem. They're not here."
stanford,They're probably stuck in traffic.
anthony,Both of them?
big,I'm out front -- waiting. I can't go in without you.
miranda,Traffic was the worst --
samantha,Ready. We're ready.
stanford,He's not here yet.
samantha,Who's not?
anthony,The groom.
carrie,What's happening?
samantha,Big's not here.
charlotte,But we're twenty-five minutes late.
carrie,Did anyone call him?  Give me a phone. Someone give me a phone.
big,I've been calling you for an hour. Why haven't you been answering your phone? 
carrie, What is going on? Where are you?
big, I was out front --but I just left. I can't do this.
carrie, Oh my God --
samantha,What do you mean he's not coming?
carrie,Get me out of here.  -- Get me out of here!
samantha,"Go, go. You take her. I'll stay here and deal with this --"
brady,"Where you going, Mommy?!"
big, Turn around and go back.
raoul,It's a one way street. I have to go around the block.
big,By the time we go around the block she'll be gone. No one's behind us - - Turn around!
raoul,I think this is them.
big,Pull over. Pull over.
big,I freaked out for a minute -- but -- I'm ready now --
carrie,I knew you would do this -- I knew it!
big,I'm sorry -- I just --
carrie,You left! I am humiliated!
big,"Carrie, wait --"
charlotte,No!
carrie,I thought I would still be in extreme pain but I'm feeling nothing.
samantha,What the hell got into him? He was perfectly fine at the dinner.
carrie,I knew it when he called last night. I could tell.
samantha,Why didn't you say anything?
carrie,Didn't want to believe it. Didn't even want to say it out loud.  I meant live. I have nowhere to live.
charlotte,You'll stay here.
carrie,Forever.
charlotte,Maybe you should eat something.
carrie,"Well, if you change your minds, I know where we can get one hundred beef, seventy-five fish and twenty- five vegetarian meals."
samantha,"Oh, honey -- I can hire people to do all that. Anything you need."
carrie,A hit man?  I have nothing to wear but a wedding gown.
charlotte,You have your honeymoon stuff here.
carrie,There's the silver lining. A honeymoon to a romantic Mexican resort that's pre-paid on my credit card because I wanted to surprise the man who jilted me.
samantha,I can get you out of that. Worse comes to worse -- I'll say there was a death or something.
carrie,Wasn't there?
miranda,I did something really bad -- I think.
charlotte,What do you mean?
miranda,It was right after Steve showed up. I was upset... Big came up to me -- and I said something like: You're crazy to get married.  It just came out.
charlotte," No, no, no. Big has been weird about marriage for years."
miranda,I keep thinking I should tell Carrie.
charlotte,"No, no. This is a really bad time to even mention it - no, no, no. Find another time. Later."
samantha,"Well, turns out, I couldn't get her out of the honeymoon -- but I got us in."
miranda,What?
samantha,I just booked us three seats on the flight. Mexico here we come.
miranda,I can't go to Mexico. I have a job.
paulo,Welcome to Mexico.
samantha,Buenos dias.
paulo,I'm sorry. I am confused. I am waiting for a Mr. And Mrs. Preston.
samantha,"Honey, you'll be waiting for a long time."
samantha,This... will kill her.  Where is she?
charlotte,In the powder room.
miranda,Oh My God!
miranda,Magda -- I'll talk to you tomorrow
samantha,"Well, it's a gorgeous sunset."
carrie,Close the shutters.
miranda,Morning.
carrie,Did I dream it?
charlotte,"Carrie, it's dinner time. You slept the whole day."
carrie,"So?  Carrie closes her eyes. Charlotte exhales, concerned."
samantha,"Honey, you have to eat a little breakfast."
carrie,I'm tired.
samantha,Eat something and you can go back to sleep.
samantha,With all this gorgeous fresh food you're just going to eat that pudding crap the entire trip?
charlotte,It's the only thing in the pantry that's totally safe.  See. Made in Poughkeepsie. I don't want to chance it.
miranda,It's a five-star resort.
charlotte,It's Mexico.
carrie,Is there coffee?
miranda,The sun feels nice.
samantha,"Jesus, honey. Wax much?"
miranda,-- What? I didn't know I was going to be in a swimsuit.
charlotte,What are you talking about?
miranda,I forgot to get a wax.
samantha,Since when -- 1998?
miranda,I've had other things on my mind.
samantha,I could be on death row and not have that situation.
miranda,"Well, when you're married, Samantha -- you have a different set of priorities."
samantha,Honey don't blame marriage --  Let me make you a spa appointment -- Any thicker and you won't be able to find it.
miranda,So what -- It's my fault?! I let the sex go out of our marriage! I deserve what I got. Thanks for understanding.
samantha,"Honey, I'm sorry. That's not what --"
miranda,I'm fine!
carrie,Let's go down to the hotel for dinner on the beach tonight.
charlotte,Really?
carrie,Yeah. I've got to do something to pull me out of my Mexicoma.
samantha,"Oh, honey... you made a little joke. Good for you."
miranda, Don't look to your --
carrie,Too late.
samantha, Felix -- We'll start with quatro margaritas.
charlotte,"No, I'm not drinking. Just bottled water."
carrie, I'll drink hers.
felix,May I have your room numbers?
carrie,We're staying in one of the private houses. Number three.
carrie,That was like taking a bullet.
miranda,Charlotte had pudding in her Prada.
carrie,Will I ever laugh again?  I'm serious.
miranda,Yes.
carrie,When?
miranda,"When something is really, really funny."
carrie,Thank god for that Mariachi band or I'd be able to hear my own thoughts.
samantha,Fabulous -- and keep them coming.
carrie,After everything I know... After twenty years of everything we've learned -- I threw it all away for the thrill of putting his name on the honeymoon suite.  If I met me now -- I wouldn't know me.
samantha,"Well, as long as we're going down this road."
charlotte,You love him.
samantha,Does that mean saying his name fifty times more a day than I say my own? Does it mean worrying about him and his needs before me and mine? Is it all about the other person? Is that love?
miranda,"No, that's marriage."
carrie,"So, you're saying marriage is a bad thing? Good to know right about now."
samantha,"Even this ring. I wanted to buy this for myself. That meant something to me. To be able to do that. Then, he buys it for me."
charlotte,Because he knew how much you loved it.
samantha,"Yes. But now, every time I look down at it... I see him. Not me."
charlotte,You could look at it and see a man who loves you and wants you to be happy.
samantha,"No, you could look at it and see that. I'm Samantha."
charlotte,Another?
samantha,Relax -- we're on vacation.
carrie,Technically -- we're on my honeymoon.
miranda,No-- I think we're on their honeymoon.
carrie,He couldn't get out of the car. After everything he'd already put me through -- he couldn't make the effort and get out of the car? I made the effort -- I put a bird on my head.
miranda,Was that what that was?
carrie,Yes.
miranda,I thought it was just feathers.
carrie,No. It was a bird.
charlotte,It was beautiful.
carrie,He's a bad guy. Always was. Bad guys do bad things.
miranda,And good guys do bad things. The good guys screw you and the bad guys screw you.
samantha,And the rest of them don't know how to screw you. Trust me-- I've done the leg work.
miranda,And that was all Steve had -- didn't have money -- didn't have a career. He was the good guy bartender with a big dick.
samantha,How big?
charlotte,I don't want to know this.
samantha,Eat your pudding.
miranda,Nine. Like -- nine and change.
carrie,That's nice. Kinda balances off the one ball.
samantha,"You can't forgive a man with a dick over nine inches?  Well, honey, if you can't -- some other woman will."
felix,Ladies -- the bar is closing.
charlotte,Thank God.
carrie, Mrs. Preston will take the check.
samantha,And a bottle of tequila.
charlotte, Don't go all the way in -- there may be sharks!
carrie,"""Mail box full."""
samantha,No time like the present.
carrie,Not ready to face it all yet.
charlotte,I'm going for a run and then to the gym for pilates. Anyone want to --
miranda,"Good news. Just got an e mail from your buyer's attorney -- they have agreed to sell you back your old apartment at that escalated price.  And ""are willing to vacate by the time you return -- pending an additional financial offer."""
carrie,"Well, apparently you can go home again -- but it'll cost you."
samantha,Now -- lets work on getting your things there.
carrie,You two could rule the world.
worker,Hello Miss.
carrie,Sweetie -- what's --
samantha,That's locked -- Use the other--
miranda,Did you   --
charlotte,"Shut up, shut up, shut up."
party girl,I love your books. You're shit's brilliant.
carrie,"Um, Cathy... You seem drunk."
party girl,Little bit. Never got to bed last night.  But I type like a motherfucker.
business guy,I have a degree in finance from Princeton and for the last two years I have been assistant to a V.P. at Merrill Lynch.
carrie, And why do you think you're right for this job?
carrie,"So, you're from St. Louis?"
louise,That's right. Louise from St. Louis.
carrie,Have you ever been a personal assistant?
louise,"No, but I'm the oldest of six kids, so I can pretty much handle anything you got."
carrie,Six kids? What was that like?
louise,Crowded. I had to move to New York just to get some room. And where'd I wind up? A one bedroom apartment with three roommates.
carrie, Aside from the space issue... why'd you move to New York?
louise,To fall in love.
carrie,"No, it's just -- so -- honest. I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that in a long time."
louise,"It's rented. ""Bag, Borrow or Steal."" It's like Netflix for purses."
carrie,No! How can I not know about this?
louise,"Girl, stick with me, I'll hook you up."
louise,Carrie Bradshaw... This is Louise.  Anne From the New York Observer...
miranda," On second thought -- Forget it. I could do a better job myself.  Miranda hangs up, exhales. Bites her salad. Determined."
miranda,"According to New York Magazine, this is the new up-and-coming neighborhood."
magda,I've been here before -- This was all Ukrainian area.
miranda,Coming or going?
miranda,Hi. I'm interested in the apartment.
nyu kid,Get in line.
miranda,I understand but -- who would I talk to about it?
nyu kid,The super.
miranda,Lovro... -- and I have no idea.  Ku...
magda, Kljuic. Lovro Klujcik. I know him.
miranda,No way.
magda,We were couple -- long time ago.
miranda, No way -- You dated?
magda,Haven't seen him since his wife died.
miranda,He's single?
lovro,"No, no... I told you on phone... the apartment is --"
samantha,That was really hot.
smith,Hmmm. You were kind of distant.
samantha,Distant? You're still in me.
smith,You want to talk about it?
samantha,When have I ever wanted to talk about it?
smith,Okay. I'll talk about it. Your best friends get screwed over by their guys -- how can you not get distant?
samantha,"It's more than that -- lately, I haven't been feeling a connection to --"
smith,What? Me?
samantha,No -- to -- it -- here. I have no real connection to our life here.
smith,What life here? Seriously -- all I do is work -- and you run off to New York every chance you get.
samantha,Not every chance I get. Only for the A-list things.  And my managing you -- it's all too much. I'm starting to resent it. For the last two years it's been all about you.
smith,"Well, for the first three years it was all about you."
samantha,I know. That was so much more fun.
smith,"Maybe we need to make an effort to reconnect -- spend more time together -- away from the business. Less me, less you -- More us."
samantha,"So, I won't be coming to New York for a while. We're going to spend some time reconnecting on the weekends... do the ""LA couple thing."""
carrie,"Yeah, hi, can you put on Samantha?"
samantha,"Really. At first I was all: ""You can't tell me what I can do"" -- but then, I had to admit he had a point."
carrie,You people and your relationships.
samantha,"Honey, a pay phone? Where's your cell?"
carrie,At the bottom of the ocean in Mexico.
samantha,Want me to hook you up with a new one?
carrie,"No, not yet. No phone -- no calls, no calls-- no questions, no questions-- no explaining no wedding."
louise,Carrie Bradshaw's web page is a mess.
carrie,-- Interesting -- so is Carrie Bradshaw.
louise,One thing at a time. Are you ever going to answer these emails?
carrie,Yes.
louise,When?
carrie,Now?
louise,Okay -- I'll read -- you tell me what to do. Vitaminsforless. Delete. Right?
carrie,So right.
louise,Who's John@jjpny.com.?
carrie,Delete.
louise,You sure you want to end all communication with him?
carrie, This is a fairy tall sweetheart. Things don't always happen like this in real life -- you should know that now.
lily,Again!
carrie,And another one bites the dust.
lily,Mommie home!
charlotte,Thanks for watching her while I went to the doctor.
carrie, Sure. Everything okay?
charlotte,I'm pregnant.
carrie,How?
charlotte,My doctor said sometimes when women stop trying -- it can happen. She knows other couples that adopt and then get pregnant.
carrie,Sweetie.
charlotte,Carrie -- I'm pregnant!
carrie,I can't believe you're even dressing up.
miranda,All the parents at Brady's school dress up -- it's fun! Fun thought up by a group of non-working mothers with nothing else to do all day.
carrie,"You said a mouthful there, sister."
miranda,Maybe I should just wear this and a business suit and go as myself.
carrie, Speaking of monsters -- I got an email from Big.
miranda,What were you expecting?
child,Boo!
carrie,Gonna take a little more than that to scare me after what I have been through.
miranda,"Steve is all about ""I'm sorry."" I'm sorry emails -- I'm sorry voice mails -- I'm sorry flowers -- I'm sorry cards. How about: don't do anything to be: "" I'm sorry"" for."
carrie,Maybe he's sorry.
miranda,Maybe Big is too.
carrie,"Point taken.  I still can't believe this happened to me. I know it happened, but I can't believe it happened. I lay awake at night going over every detail of the last week in my head."
miranda,Carrie -- There's a detail I've been meaning to tell you about --
miranda,"You look great, you look amazing. So. That's the worst of it."
carrie,Wait -- what's that say? In the box at the end?
miranda," ""Editor's note: The wedding of Carrie Bradshaw and John James Preston was cancelled as this issue went to press. Carrie Bradshaw is..."
carrie,Is what?
charlotte,I saw it. The pictures are gorgeous.
carrie,Yes -- I'm a beautiful bride. Come in.
charlotte,"Look, the people who don't know -- will only see the beautiful pictures. The people who do know will only see what an asshole he is.  Mommy said a bad word."
carrie," Hi, honey."
lily,Cinderella.
charlotte,Or -- we also brought Mulan.
lily,Yea!
charlotte,Just in our building -- if you feel up to it.
lily,Yea!
carrie, Yea!
harry,No costume?
carrie,Look closer. I'm the scariest thing in New York. Jilted at Forty-one. Boo.
carrie,"You know you have to give me some of your loot, right?"
woman,"Oh, Carrie, I saw Vogue -- I'm so sorry."
carrie,Louise!
louise,Oh my Lord. I did not even recognize you.
carrie,That's the point. My head is the witness protection program.
louise,I'm really feeling that look on you.
carrie,And I am feeling that Balenciaga on you.
louise,Mine till Tuesday.
carrie,Already?
louise,Your new number... area code: 347 --
carrie,"Hold, Hold, Hold. 347? No, no. I'm a 917 gal. Always have been."
louise,"No longer available. Now, you're"
carrie,Great. Now even I don't recognize me.
samantha,Samantha Jones.
carrie,-- Or I used to be.
samantha,Talk to me.
carrie,I'm a 347 area code. How tacky is that?
samantha,347 is the new New York.
carrie,I want the old New York with the old 917 and my old will to live.
samantha,"Old New York, new New York -- honey -- at least it's New York."
carrie,Looking?
samantha,"Just looking. After I saw Steve's face at the rehearsal dinner, I could never ---"
rescue woman,She needs a good a home. Interested?
rescue woman,"She's been fixed, but she hasn't lost the urge."
samantha,And she needs a little eye work. Anything you can do about these stains?
louise,Do you want me to get rid of it?
carrie,"No, it's too beautiful. I'll just bury it deep in the back -- like I did my feelings."
louise,Do you miss him?
carrie," Every day. You know, it's weird -- I haven't cried very much at all. Maybe you're only allotted a certain amount of tears per man -- and I used mine up."
louise,"Yeah. I know how you feel `cause, my college boyfriend broke up with me last year. And I miss him all the time."
louise,"And it threw me so hard `cause, you know, I thought Will -- that's his name... was the love of my life."
carrie,What happened?
louise,"He said he loved me and all -- but didn't think I was ""the one""."
carrie,Good.
louise,"Love is the thing, you know."
carrie,"Oh, I remember that smile.   Who's the guy?"
louise,Someone I just met. He wants me to meet him for a drink.
carrie,At 11:30?     That's a bootie call.
louise,"No, it's not like that... he just got off work -- he's a waiter."
carrie,"Louise, I may not get texts and I may not send texts -- but trust me: The sub-text of that text: Bootie."
louise,But it's not a bootie call if he meets me.... right?
carrie,"All right, then. You kids enjoy. That's what your twenties are for. Your thirties are to learn the lessons."
harry,You going for your run?
charlotte,Um... no.
harry,You didn't go yesterday either.
charlotte,I know.
harry,Why is that?
charlotte, I don't feel like running!
harry, Okay. Welcome to the house of hormones.
carrie,"It's all about the desk. If I find the desk, the writing will come. And it better `cause I'm using my new book advance to pay the fancy decorator."
charlotte,I think it's so great that you are re-doing your entire apartment.
carrie,Out with the old --  -- In with the overpriced.
charlotte,Why'd he do that?
carrie,`Cause he loves you... and he's concerned.
charlotte,There is nothing to be concerned about.
carrie,Did the doctor say it wasn't safe or something?
charlotte,"No, she said because I'm already a runner -- it's fine."
carrie,"So, why are you not --"
charlotte,I'm afraid something bad will happen. It's a miracle that I'm even pregnant.
carrie,But if the doctor said --
charlotte,"It's not rational, Carrie... it's irrational. I know that."
carrie,Okay.
charlotte,"I've got everything I ever wanted. I'm so happy -- I'm terrified.  No one gets everything they want. Look at you. Look at Miranda. You're such good people and look what happened to you. Of course, something bad is going to happen to me."
carrie,"Sweetie, you shit your pants this year. Maybe you're done."
louise,You sure you don't want me to RSVP to some of these holiday parties?
carrie,Yep. I'm perfectly happy spending time home alone.  And speaking of home -- you're going to miss your plane.
louise,Merry Christmas. It's just something silly.
carrie,Oh... Louise from St. Louis.
louise,You said you never saw it -- so.
carrie,"Now, I feel bad. If I had known we were going to exchange gifts -- "
louise,No! That is not what I think it is.
carrie,Open it.
louise,Oh my Lord. Oh my --
carrie,No more rent girl for you.
louise,Look who's home from the big city!
miranda,And what are you gonna say at midnight?
brady,Happy New Year.
miranda,"That's right -- but you gotta say it more excited than that --  ""Happy New Year!"""
brady,Happy New Year!
miranda,You say that and then... you kiss.
steve,"You all ready to go, B-boy?"
miranda,Did you pack the new Batman Santa brought you?
steve,Aw man -- Gotta have the new Batman.
miranda,It's there near the tree.
steve,You got plans with the girls?
miranda,We're all kinda staying in tonight.
steve,Would you like to come and eat with us? We can go somewhere over here on your side.
miranda,"No, thank you."
steve,Miranda -- I never meant to hurt you.  105B.
miranda,There he is. Batman.
steve,Put your hat on. It's snowing out.
miranda,Happy New Year.
brady,Kiss.
miranda,See you tomorrow.
judy garland,ZING ZING ZING WENT MY HEARTSTRINGS THE MOMENT I MET HIM -- I FELL
carrie,Hello?
stanford,Happy New Year -- We're having a fabulous time. The only thing missing is you. Come.
carrie,"That's sweet but I can't, I'm writing."
stanford,Oh... Okay.  You're not really writing are you?
carrie,No. You're not really having a fabulous time are you?
stanford,No. Rescue me. It's very forced festive.
carrie,"Oh yes, that's just what every New Year's Eve party needs: a visit from the lost Bronte sister."
stanford,Well... Better a Bronte sister than a Hilton sister.
carrie, Thanks but -- by ten PM I'll be in bed asleep and blissfully unaware of how fabulous this night is supposed to be.
carrie,Hello.
miranda,I thought one of the perks of having a family is you don't have to spend New Year's Eve alone with Chinese food.  I'm alone with Chinese food.
carrie,I was sleeping.
miranda,"Oh, shit -- I'm sorry."
carrie,That's okay. Where's Brady?
miranda,It's Steve's night.
carrie,Right.
miranda,Go back to sleep -- don't wake up.
carrie,It's okay. Are you alright?
miranda,I'm fine -- I was just getting a little choked-up watching the stupid New Year's Eve stuff on TV alone.
carrie,Want me to come over?
miranda,I'm all the way downtown --
carrie,I can grab a cab --
miranda,On New Year's Eve? No way. I'm fine... really. 
carrie,You're not alone.
carrie,Easy girl.
samantha,Thanks -- Three months driving in L.A. and I forgot how to use my fucking legs.
carrie,This way. I hear the couture calling my name.
samantha,"See this -- this is what I miss. Last night Smith and I cuddled in front of the TV with ""take out"" Mexican."
charlotte,You've been doing it for five years.
samantha,"No, see -- I've always had girlfriends on the side."
miranda,There's Mayor Bloomberg.
samantha,There we are.
charlotte,We're in the front row?!
samantha,I pulled some strings.
carrie,Very nice.
samantha,I should go thank them --
charlotte,Decide where we want to go for lunch -- I'll make the call.  It's like old times.
miranda,"So, this is how you all spent your Saturdays while I was with Brady and Steve at the Brooklyn Aquarium."
carrie,Well... Not every Saturday.
miranda,"Just so you know -- We always had front row at the mammal show.  Steve does the funniest dolphin impression. Actually, it's more -- Steve as a dolphin --"
charlotte,You really can't forgive him?
miranda,Are you suggesting something?
charlotte,I like Steve. I've always liked Steve -- He's apologized a hundred times -- he's not seeing anyone else. What's it going to take?
miranda,And are you also suggesting that she forgive Big?
charlotte,No. I could kill Big. Sometimes when I'm running -- I imagine what I'd say if I ever saw him again. I have the perfect opening sentence. Want to hear it?
carrie, Ah.... yes.
charlotte,I curse the day you were born.
carrie,Impressive. Better work up a hand gesture to go with it.
elaine,Thank god you're here. They have me covering this Mercedes-Benz fashion week and I'm desperate for a Carrie Bradshaw-esque quote.
carrie,"Well, I'll do my best. We'll talk after?"
elaine,Great. And -- ooh -- my back --
carrie,I've gotta go.
miranda,Should I --
charlotte,"Carrie, wait."
carrie,This was a mistake -- it's too soon -- I'm not ready. I'll go get a coffee and you guys call me after -- and I'll meet you for lunch.
charlotte,Are you sure? I know how much you were looking forward to this.
carrie,"Yeah, I really was... until I became the poster child for wounded women everywhere."
charlotte,You're not.
carrie,Is this thing going to effect everything I do for the rest of my life?
charlotte,No -- but if you leave right now -- it will effect the rest of your day.
carrie,Where everyone can see me.
charlotte,Who cares about them -- You only came for the clothes.
samantha,We thought we were leaving.
samantha,Let's get a cab -- I am starv --
samantha," God, I miss New York."
carrie,Hello?
samantha,I'm just calling to make sure you aren't hanging from your shower rod.
carrie,You called an hour too early.
samantha,"So, what's the V-day plan?"
carrie,Miranda and I are going to dinner and then a really violent slasher movie.
samantha,Perfect.
carrie,And you?
samantha,I am making Smith sushi. Pause for reaction.
carrie,Wow. Do you make sushi?
samantha,"We took a class a while back -- and when he walks in the door at seven- thirty, I am going to surprise him by laying on the dining room table - -- covered with homemade sushi."
carrie,"Boy, you do have time on your hands."
miranda,Is it me or is Valentine's Day this year on steroids?
carrie,I think it was like this last year but we played for the other team.
waitress,Good evening. Here's our special Valentine night menu. All the selections are romantic in theme and designed to be split for two. Are you having wine?
waitress,A glass or a bot --
waitress,I'll be right back to take you and your girlfriends order.
miranda,I could do a lot worse.
miranda,Why would you look at the Vogue today of all days?
carrie,"`Cause -- I'm an emotional cutter.  I deserve what I got. Running all over New York believing that I'm finally getting my happy ending. ""See everyone, love does conquer all. Look at me in my one of a kind wedding gown marrying the love of my life."""
waitress,Would you like another bot --
carrie,"And Miranda... in that article -- I did not say ""we"" once. It was all: ""I"" want and ""I"" think."
miranda,It was from your point of view.
carrie,My point of view... Exactly. The whole wedding was my point of view. I let the wedding get bigger than Big. I am the reason he didn't get out of that car.
miranda,You can't put this all on yourself.  Okay. I said something I shouldn't have said to Big at the rehearsal dinner. 
carrie,What do you mean?
miranda,I was really upset after Steve showed up and I bumped into Big and -- I said that you two were crazy to get married.
waitress,Here we go. Your Shiraz.
miranda,Stop -- It's fine -- Thanks.
carrie,I have been going over this and over this in my mind for five months -- and -- for five months you kept a secret like that?
miranda,I tried to tell you once but the Vogue article came out --
carrie,Once? You tried to tell me once? You should have tried to tell me every single day!
miranda,"I know, I was looking for the right time."
carrie,There is no right time to tell me you ruined my marriage!
miranda,It just happened -- I wasn't thinking.
carrie,And I think what hurts the most is that you kept a secret from me. I have never ever kept a secret from you. Ever!
smith,I'm home!
samantha,You are three hours late.
smith,Bummer. I know. Did you eat?
samantha,"Yes, I ate. I ate the sushi that I hand made for you. The sushi that I planned to lay all over my naked body as a Valentines surprise for you."
smith,Why are you so upset? I called.
samantha,I slaved away in a kitchen all day to make this meal for you.
smith,You made some sushi -- it's not a big deal!
samantha,Not a big deal?
miranda,Carrie.
carrie,How long have you been waiting here?
miranda,Seventeen dollars long.  Please get in. It just turned to eighteen.
carrie,I'm upset.
miranda,"Carrie, I understand -- but it just happened -- I never meant to hurt you.  You have to forgive me."
carrie,You know --
miranda,What?
carrie,No.
miranda,Please. What were you going to say?
carrie,You badger me to forgive you in three days -- and you won't even consider forgiving Steve for something he did six months ago.
miranda,It's not the same thing.
carrie,It's forgiveness.
miranda,I don't know if I can trust that it won't happen again.
therapist,Steve - you're very quiet today.
steve,"Miranda, I know I made it hard for you to trust me. But -- You made it hard for me to trust you."
miranda,Me?!
steve,"The way you treated me and cut me out of your life like that? I mean, yeah -- I broke a vow. But what about the other vows? Like promising to love someone for better or for worse? What about that?"
therapist,You don't. And she doesn't know for sure that you won't have another indiscretion.  All you can know... is that you want to move forward and risk that you love for each other won't allow that to happen.
miranda,"So, we're done with our last session and we're not allowed to talk for two weeks while we figure out if being together again is something we really want. And then - - we had to pick a place to meet -- and if we both show up on that day - - the past no longer exists. Showing up is the promise we make to each other that we're willing to let it all go and move forward."
carrie,Can you do that?
miranda,I don't know. I have a lot of thinking to do.
carrie,Thinking -- or feeling?
miranda,What do you mean?
carrie,"Miranda -- you're a lawyer. You can argue both sides of any case -- but, why we feel what we feel -- isn't logical. It's emotional. Sorry, Harvard -- I'm afraid you're going to have to make this decision based on your emotions."
miranda,"Well, then -- I'm screwed. I don't know what I feel."
carrie,You will. There will come a moment when you'll know. And if it's: yes - - all that brilliant logic will go out the window... with the past.
miranda,And I thought picking the place to meet was a challenge.
carrie,Where is it?
miranda,The Brooklyn Bridge. Halfway between both our places.
carrie,Very logical. And yet poetic.
miranda,Poetic -- if we both show up. Otherwise -- you're on a bridge -- rejected. Not a good plan.
louise,I have two pieces of good news.
carrie,And I have two coffees.
louise,I just got a heads-up from your realtor. The apartment on Fifth finally sold.
carrie,What's the other news?
louise,I'm moving back to St. Louis -- we are getting married in the fall.
samantha,No! Come back here.
samantha,"Where are you, baby?"
dante,Want to join me?
samantha,Smith is interested - but the dates will have to work with the series.
samantha,We agreed that no one else from the show but Smith was going to be on the cover.
miranda,Kiss me.
carrie,Sorry. This is a very exclusive party.
miranda,We're on the list. Miranda Hobbes plus one...and a half.
anthony,A woman just put a glass down on your new desk without a coaster. I told her if she did it again I'd break her arm.
carrie,Thanks.
miranda,Where's Samantha? Her plane landed two hours ago.
carrie,"You know her, probably ran to the hotel gym for a quick work-out."
samantha,There's no place like home.
carrie,Sweetie!
miranda,There's a rat in your purse.
carrie,And that rat better be house trained.
cater waiter,Can I take your coat?
charlotte,Samantha!
samantha,Did you ever think you'd see the day -- me with a pooch.
miranda,"So, she has a belly. So what?"
carrie,"No, a belly on anyone else is a ""so what?"" A belly on Samantha is a: ""So what the hell is going on?"""
charlotte,She never mentioned it on the phone?
carrie,Never. And when has she ever not talked about every detail regarding her body?
charlotte,Should we even bring it up?
miranda,"What -- like a fat intervention? ""We love you -- have a salad?"" No. We should let her bring it up."
samantha,"Ladies, we can talk about my gut later-- right now, I'm bored to tears here."
samantha,I eat -- so I won't cheat.
miranda,What exactly are you eating?
samantha,Everything except Dante's dick.
carrie,"Language, please -- this is a grown- up apartment now."
samantha,I guess I didn't realize how big I was until I saw it on your faces.
carrie,How -- and I say this with love -- How could you not realize it?
samantha,I've been avoiding mirrors.
charlotte,I'm proud of you for not cheating.
samantha,I don't know if there's anything to be proud of. I stuff my face to stop myself from doing something that feels natural to me.
carrie,Why didn't you say something?
samantha,I guess I didn't want to admit it. And when you're in denial -- you don't dial.
carrie,"Now, listen -- this isn't about the weight. You'd be gorgeous at any size. But are you happy?"
samantha, How often do you feel happy in your relationship?
carrie, I'm pretty sure that's to you.
charlotte,Every day.
samantha,You feel happy ever day?
charlotte,Not all day -- everyday -- but everyday.
miranda,When was the last time you felt happy?
samantha,Six months ago.
carrie,What does your gut tell you?
samantha,"I know but --  Smith stayed with me through chemo. If he could stay with me through that, I should be able to stay in this relationship for him."
carrie,Sweetie... You just compared your relationship to chemo.
smith,Hey -- You're home! I thought you were staying the week.
samantha,We need to talk.
smith,Awwww... man. I knew this was coming.
samantha,Yeah. This isn't working.  I've done my best. I've given it five years and fifteen pounds.
smith,What -- You don't love me any more?
samantha,"Yes, I love you - ah, fuck it -- I'm just gonna say the thing you're not supposed to say -- I love you but I love me more. And I've been in a relationship with myself for forty-nine years and that's the one I need to work on."
smith,What will you find?
samantha,I don't know. But that's a risk I'm willing to take.
stewardess,We're landing in new York. I'm gonna need to take that now.
louise,And I put all the unopened mail from your P.O. Box in the manila envelopes on the bottom shelf there.
carrie,What am I gonna do without you?
louise,You'll find some other girl... but she won't have my style.
carrie,"St. Louise, you brought me back to life."
louise,And you gave me Louise Vuitton.
carrie,"Wait -- don't forget your ""love."""
louise,"No, I found my love. I'm leaving that with you."
carrie,I'll meet you in St. Louis.
samantha,"Hi, I'm your new neighbor."
hot neighbor,Diego.
samantha,Samantha.
hostess,When are you due?
charlotte,Next week.
hostess,You look gorgeous.
charlotte," Oh, thank-you."
waitress,"Hi, can I --"
charlotte,"No, I'm sorry -- I can't stay -- Help me -- pull out the table. I can't --"
big,Charlotte. Charlotte wait --
charlotte,I don't want to see you.
big,My car's right there. Get in my car.
charlotte,I don't want to get in your car -- I hate your car. Taxi!
big,Charlotte -- we need to get you to the hospital -- Please get in my car. It's right here and ready.
carrie,Hi. Congratulations... A girl!
harry,It's my lot in life to be surrounded by beautiful women.
carrie,Oh my God. She's gorgeous.
charlotte,Say hello to Rose.
carrie,What a beautiful name.
charlotte,"After Harry's ""Bubbie."""
harry,"Now, we got a Lily and a Rose."
carrie,"Well, I have to say you two are very cool customers -- just making the ""baby's here"" call without all the ""I'm in labor"" drama."
harry,Oh -- there was plenty of drama.
charlotte,My water broke in front of a restaurant.
carrie,Very dramatic.
harry,Wait -- she's not done.
charlotte,It broke while I was talking to Big.
carrie,What?
harry,See. Drama.
charlotte,I bumped into him and I got so upset I started crying and then - my water broke.
harry,He brought her to the hospital. Stayed until the baby was born.
charlotte,I think he was hoping to see you.
carrie,Well -- today is not about him. It's about beautiful baby Rose.  So -- we know she has Charlotte's hair -- what else do we know?  Harry and Charlotte give each other a sad glance.
carrie,She's a doll. Mazel tov!
harry,He asked me to ask you to call him.
carrie,Harry -- it's so much more complicated than you can imagine.
harry,I know it is -- and you have every right to never call him -- but I'm just a big pile of love today --and I feel bad for the guy. He said he's been writing you -- but you never responded.
carrie, He's never written me.
harry,He said he wrote because he didn't have your phone number.
carrie,No. He's never written me. Ever.
harry,"Then, why would he say that he had?"
louise,We are shopping for my wedding gown.
angela,That one makes you look weird.
louise, Momma -- can you please -- This is a work call.
carrie,"No, it's okay I figured it out."
louise,"Well, I was going to call you anyway -- today is the final day on the Fifth Avenue apartment. You have till six before they change the locks."
carrie,I don't need to go over there.
louise,And do you NOT want those never- worn shoes?
carrie,Oh -- I completely forgot about --
louise,`Cause if you don't -- send them on to me. I'll squeeze my feet into them.
carrie,It's already five o'clock.
louise,Hello? There are never been worn four hundred dollar shoes!
carrie,Five twenty-five.  Bye.
carrie,Taxi!
big,I was going to get these to you. I didn't want it to be a total loss.
carrie,Why did we ever decide to get married?
big, I guess we were afraid it meant something if we didn't.
carrie,I'm sorry to have done that to you...  And you know the funny part?
big,Is there a funny part?
carrie,We were perfectly happy before we decided to live happily ever after.
big,Yep. The jokes on us.
carrie,Good closet.
big,Thanks.
carrie,Comfortable. Is this what you had in mind when you installed the carpet?
big,I'd like to think I was that smooth.
carrie,We better get up before the new owner bust in on us.
big,And the way we decided to get married -- All business... No romance. That's not the way you propose to someone.
judge,"By the power vested in me, by the state of New York, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride."
big,Ever thine. Ever mine. Ever ours.
big,You okay that it was just us?
carrie,Perfect. You and me -- like I said.
big,Still. Would have been nice if you had the girls here.  He holds the door open for her as they walk outside.
big,Which is why I called them.
charlotte,Mazel tov!
guard,Excuse me -- excuse me! You're not allowed to throw rice anymore.
samantha,"Honey, get over it -- It's New York!"
waitress,Who had the ham and eggs?
carrie,Maybe some labels are best left in the closet...
charlotte,Hmmm. This is delicious.
miranda,Why did we ever stop drinking these?
carrie,Because everyone else started.
samantha," Well, that is an oldie but goodie."
carrie,And speaking of an oldie but goodie...
all,To the next fifty.
