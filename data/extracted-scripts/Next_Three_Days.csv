Speaker,Dialogue
shooting script,"August 6, 2009"
lara,You know what? If you were smart you would stop talking right now.
erit,Sue me. I just know that women should never work for women.
lara,How can you say that??
erit,They're always threatened. Especially if you're beautiful and they're not.
lara,"Erit, you are so full of shit."
erit,"So, your boss isn't threatened by you?"
lara,Because she's a bitch! --  --Not because she's a woman.
erit,"And you would describe her as ""attractive""?"
lara,That has nothing to do with it!
erit,And there is my answer.
john,Either of you like another drink?
erit,"Women should work under men, men under women. That's it."
john, But men under men?
erit,"That's fine, too.  They're used to it! Why are you laughing?"
erit," Oh please, I'd rather work under him, too."
lara,"You'd rather ""work under"" John?"
lara,"So, I shouldn't take offense that you're coming on to my husband right in front of me."
erit," Lara, if I wanted your husband I would have him."
lara,How? You couldn't possibly show him more of your tits.
erit,-- You know what your problem is?!
john,She is completely full of shit.
lara,DON'T try and agree with me now.
john,You know what? I don't even believe she is in the dental profession.
lara,Shut up.
john,I bet she can't even spell anesthesiologist. Woman's a complete fraud.
lara,"We went to her office party, idiot."
john,"I think she hit on me that night, too."
lara,You are completely delusional. She wasn't even hitting on you in there; I just don't like her.
john,I understand. People who look like that should not be allowed anywhere near oral surgery.
lara,You are such an asshole.
john,You're in the chair trying to stay calm; how are you supposed to do that with those things hanging over your--
lara,Hello!
jenna,Only when I dropped him down the stairs.
john,Thanks.   See you next weekend.
john,"Okay, your turn."
lara,Squeeze in tight.
john,You can't do this every morning.   It is way too corny.
lara,Smile.   It's just until he's eighteen.
john," Sweetie, you have to stop believing everything you read in a catalogue."
lara,You hate brushing your teeth; this one brushes them in thirty seconds.
john, The lies your mother tells.
lara, When's your last class?
john,"Three, and I have papers to grade. Can you pick up Luke?"
lara,After yesterday I probably don't have a job anyway. Do you think it was wrong to call her a useless cow?
john,Bosses admire that kind of frank exchange.
lara, Did you call your father?
john,When?
lara," ""When?"" Yesterday, for his birthday!"
lara,You're completely impossible.
john,Mom said Happy Birthday and my father went . Made me tear up.
lara,Ever think that someone has to be the bigger person here?
john, Remember this for the custody hearing: how Mommy is always scolding Daddy.
lara,How are you going to feel if Luke grows up and doesn't call you?
john,Now she's driving a wedge between us.
lara,I give up.
john,And now she is abandoning you.
detective quinn,Police.   Mr. Brennan?
john,Get your --
detective quinn,Touch me again and you'll be arrested.
detective collero,Lara Brennan?
lara,WHAT?!
detective collero,"Lara Brennan, you are under arrest for the murder of Elizabeth Gesas."
lara,She's dead??     Elizabeth is dead??
john, She didn't do anything!
detective quinn,I will only --
john, She didn't do anything!
detective quinn,Put him in cuffs.
john,You okay?
luke,Not at lunch.
john,Does he take your food?
luke,No.
john,Did he say something mean?  About Mommy?
luke,Yeah.
john,Did you hit him?
luke,Yeah.
john,Good.    Where did you hit him?
luke,Near the swings.
john,Wow.    I bet that hurt.
luke,Yeah.
john,It's a toy!
lara,"Hi honey. Can Mommy get a kiss?  Come on, give Mommy a kiss."
john,Rat-Bag.   Give Mommy a kiss.
lara,Is Daddy reading you my letters?
john,Every night at bedtime.
lara,What are you building?    A fort?
john,"I walked him to class, gave him a kiss; he didn't even look back to wave."
lara,What did you make him for lunch?
john,"Turkey sandwich, just butter and bread, no ""vegetables"" on it. He swore he ate his apple."
lara,Look at his friends.   And his desk. This is his teacher?
john,Miss Phillips.
lara,You may have to move to another school district.
john,Already spoke to a realtor.
lara, How was your first day?
john,Excellent. Over half my class stayed awake. Talked to your mom.
lara,When is she coming?
john,She's having a lot of trouble with her business.
lara,"It's only been a couple of years, I'm sure she'll get around to it.  Have you heard anything?"
john,"About the appeal? Yes, and I'm just not telling you. What did Meyer say?"
lara,--Don't--
john,-- It can take months for the court to rule.
lara,I saw that woman. She was there. She couldn't have just disappeared.
john,Meyer's looking for a new investigator.
lara,"Her coat snagged my purse, I felt a button pop - they must have been blind not to find it."
john,He'll go through all the evidence again.
lara,"Great, because I haven't quite bankrupted us yet."
john,We're doing fine.
lara, Can you do me a favor?
john,"I don't know, I'm a little busy."
lara,I need you to run for governor.
john,"-- Oh, that I can do."
lara,"You can change this rule about no conjugal visits, because I don't think I can last another twenty years."
john,I know. But it's going to be fine. I promise.
lara,You think he'll ever want to kiss me again?
john,"Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty."
paula,How's Lara?
john,She's doing okay.
paula,Tell her we're pulling for her.
john,I will.
paula,They won't recycle these unless you take off the cap.  This is trash. This is recyclable.
john,Ok.   Thanks.
john,"Luke!   Let's go, Toad.   Come on."
nicole,"Time to go, Carrie!"
meyer,"John, I said my office at four o'clock. I can't leave, I'm in --"
john, I figured you had to eat.
meyer,Do you have the ruling in Brennan?
john,But what if we find the woman who was leaving the parking lot?
meyer,The PCRA was rejected. No new evidence can be submitted. Not anymore.
john,It was a robbery!   Someone stole her purse!
meyer,And if they'd used her credit cards we would have had something to argue. I'm sorry; this really...sucks.
john,"So, that's it. Now we just have the Supreme Court."
meyer,"John, in the last thirty years, the Supreme Court hasn't heard one murder case. No decent lawyer would even file the pleadings."
john,"So, I need to find an indecent one?"
meyer,"No, I'm going to file it. But I need you to do something for me."
john,Anything.
meyer,I need you to look at the evidence and just forget Lara is your wife.
john," I've seen the evidence, Meyer."
meyer,"I'm not saying judge her innocent or guilty, I'm just saying look at it. He co-worker sees her leaving the scene, she has the victim's blood on her clothes, her fingerprints on the murder weapon--"
john, We went out for dinner! How do you do that after you kill somebody? She would have to be a psychopath!
meyer,-- And the fight in the office.
john,Everyone fights with their boss!
meyer,But this one ended up dead.
john,"So, you never believed she was innocent?"
meyer,How can you say that?
john,"So, what are you saying, Meyer?!"
meyer,That it no longer matters what we believe; Lara's not getting out. And you have no idea how much I hate saying that.
john, I'll find someone to file the pleadings.
meyer,John! Come on! For Christ's sake. JOHN!!
erit,I know you won't want to hear this...
john,Thanks.
john,Lara Brennan; my wife. She was sent up here. Brennan. B-R-
duty nurse, She can't have visitors.
john,That's ridiculous; I have to see her.
duty nurse,I'm sorry.
john,Lara!
john,My wife attempted suicide.
john,I have to see her!
john,Please.   Two minutes.
jenna,I'm sorry. He just keeps pretending he's asleep.
john, Don't worry about it.
john,I insist.    I kept you out on a school night.
jenna,I'm not in school anymore.
john,"And give a big hug to Pengui, Little Pengui, Big Turtley, Little Turtley, Kiki and Opossumy. Lots and lots of love, Mommy.  Should we write her back?"
luke,...When is she coming home?
john,Soon honey.    Soon.
luke, Can I have a quarter?
john,Can you have a quarter?
luke,Then can I have them all?
john,...Sure.
john,"So, what is it about?   Julie?"
julie,That belief in someone's virtue is more important than virtue itself?
john,"No. I mean, yes, that's in there. But what is it about?"
john,"It's a course that investigates what drives men to be free, no matter the cost."
damon,Somebody else had dibs on Papillon?
john,You escaped from jail seven times.
tough guy,No smoking!!
damon,"Yeah, who would want to cut short your precious life?"
john,Mind if I tape you?
damon,"Go for it, it can't be used as evidence. What do you want to know?"
john,How you escaped when no one else could.
damon,Balls and a little luck.  No prison in the world is airtight. Each one has a key. You have to find it.
john,How do you do that?
damon,"A lot of looking. Especially at things that break the daily routine. Guards get comfortable doing the same thing every day. Something happens where they have to think, adapt. "
john,The city.
damon,Where are you from?
john,...Pittsburgh.
damon,Pittsburgh is tough; so many bridges and tunnels they can block off.
john,How can they be so exact?
damon,"After 9-11 Homeland Security made every city have a lock-down plan -- downtown Pittsburgh, Philly, Boston, Minneapolis -- fifteen minutes. They can do DC in under ten."
damon,"And be running rolling stops on the secondary roads. They won't have your photograph yet, but they will have your description."
john,Thirty-five minutes isn't a lot of time.
damon,Then surrender. 
damon,Forget the local airports.   Leave from another state.
damon,"Second: identity. It's easy to find fake papers, harder to find ones that will get you through an airport."
damon,"If you have to rent a car, find a place that will take a cash deposit. They'll still run a credit check, so use a real person's name on the ID.  Third: destination."
damon,Then money.
john,How much?
damon,Enough to last at least five-six years. Run out of money and you run out of friends.
damon,"But before you do anything, you have to ask yourself if you can do it. Can you forget about ever seeing your parents again. Can you kill a guard, leave your kid at a gas station, push a nice old lady to the ground because she is between you and the door? Because to do this thing, that's who you have to become. And if you can't, don't start, because you'll just get someone killed."
damon,I gave myself up. I couldn't take wondering when someone was going to come through the bedroom door.  Got what you need?
john,Yeah.
damon,What do you have in your pocket?
luke,It was already tied.
woman's voice,Mr. Brennan?
john,"Oh, sorry.    Hello, Doctor."
john,I'll talk to her.
john,Hey. Are you alright?
lara,I'm fine.    I'm fine.
john,The doctor told me about the insulin.
lara," Yeah, I forgot. It's no big deal."
john,You forgot?    For how many days?
lara,"I forgot, okay? I have things on my mind."
john,--And so much to do.
lara,"Oh, that's nice."
john,Why are you doing this?
lara,Can I please just watch him play? Tell me about kindergarten.
john,No.   I need you to --
lara,"Fine, I won't forget again, okay?  I am just never going to walk him to school or wash his clothes or make him dinner...and I don't know how I can live knowing that. Okay?"
john,Lara. Look at me. Something will happen. I promise.
lara," What? What is going to happen? There are no more appeals, there are no more anything. Exactly what miracle are we hoping for, John?"
john,Sure.
lara,Stop bringing him.
john,Come on...
lara,He hates coming here.   Look at him.
john,Lara....
lara,Please. It's not his fault. It's too hard to watch him forget me.
john,Yes.    Anything.
lara,My mother tried to send me anti-aging cream.
eugenie,You're sure that you don't want a lawn sign?
john,I'm very sure. Thanks.
copter pilot,"On the left, Allegheny County Jail. Built in 1995, it is now the largest jail in the world. There have been three escape attempts. No one's made it out alive. On your right..."
lyla,"On the first landing, which was as small as the necessary turn of the stairs allowed, there was a niche in the column, about a yard wide, and in this niche the prince felt convinced that a man stood concealed. He thought he could distinguish a figure standing there."
john,Thanks.
john,Adderall?
mouss,"Ten apiece, five for forty."
john,I need some passports.
mouss,Piss off.
mouss,You have to pay up front.
john,I can do that.
mouss,You know the Uptown on 5th Ave?
john,No.
mouss,Ask for Harv.
john,What's your name?
mouss,Just say Mouss.
john,Mouss said to come see you.
harv,"He did, did he? What do you want?"
john,"Three passports, a driver's license, and real social security number."
harv,How do you know Mouss?
john,He babysits my kid.
harv,You have the photos on you?
john,Yes.   How much?
harv,Fifteen hundred.
mouss,"I ever see you again, you lose an eye."
eugenie,You did remember I was showing the house?
john,Give me two minutes.
eugenie,It really is a great neighborhood.
grace,"Oh, my lord!     What happened?"
john,"It was stupid, I fell off the bike."
grace,The bike that's been in our garage for two years? Put your head back.
john,Some guy made a crack about Lara.
grace,"So, that's what you do now: punch everyone who thinks she's guilty?"
john,What's that supposed to mean?
grace,"It means it's important what YOU believe, not --"
john,"Really?   So, what do you believe, Mom?"
grace,Why are you trying to start a fight?
john, Where is his bag?
grace,Why are you doing this?!
john,No reason. I just stupidly thought people who loved her would actually believe she's innocent. My mistake.
grace,Stop this!
john, Give Grandma a kiss.
luke,Does your face hurt?
john,A little.
luke,Did you hit him back?
john,No.
luke,That's okay.
john,What?
mike,I was at the bar.    I know what you are looking for.
mike,What do you need?
john,"Three passports, a driver's license and social security number that can take a credit check."
mike,Thirty seven hundred.
john,That's too much.
mike,It is if you never get them. I need photos and a thousand in advance.
mike,I'll bring them Wednesday.
john,Not here.   Don't come here again.
mike,"Parking lot of Don's. Eckert Street. Under the bridge; two o'clock. If I'm not there on time, leave."
john,Show me how to load it.
john,No video game.
john,I'll play checkers with you after dinner.
john," Not tonight. Tonight, I utterly destroy you."
notary,Mr. Brennan?
notary,And just put your thumb there.
john,I'll just be a moment.
lara, Your poor face. How could you do that to yourself?
john,I am useless without you.    I can't even ride a bike.
lara,I think it's very sexy.
john,I'm sorry we had to do this.
lara,You have nothing to apologize for. But you should have told me before this.
john,I know.
lara,I don't want you not telling me things.
john,From now on I will.
lara," I close my eyes and I see Luke in his bedroom, you on the sofa by the Window. I won't know where to picture you anymore."
john,Hi.
paula,I was wondering if I could ask you to water my plants next week; I'm going in for an operation.
john,I hope it's nothing serious.
paula,My idiot doctor misdiagnosed me. He's blaming the lab; the lab's blaming him. But I'll be fine. Thanks.
john,"Hi. It's John. Luke isn't feeling well, I'm going to take him home. I need Carl to cover my 2:30 class."
mike,You were supposed to leave.
john,I need them.
mike,You notice that guy was a cop?
john,Which guy?
mike,The one with the red light in his back window.
john,How are you doing today?
guard,Don't touch that.
john,Sorry.
major,"So, you are where in here?"
john,...In the middle there.
major,In the middle. Can you point to yourself?
john, It's hard to tell.   I think that's me there. Why?
major,So that's not you there.   By the elevator?
john, I was over here. You want to tell me what's going on?
major,You want me to tell you?
john,Yes.
major,You know what a bump key is?
john,Sorry.
major,"If this was you, you might want to think about what's going to happen to your kids if both of their parents are in prison."
detective collero,"-- The worst date you've ever been on? This was worse. And this guy? He really thinks he is doing great. Then he's driving me home and I know he's going to try and kiss me, so I pretend to fall asleep. I mean, I'm actually snoring, right in his car. Does that stop him?"
detective quinn,Did I tell you not to date cops?
male neighbor,What's your problem? He's not home!
male neighbor,"No, I'm saying you're an idiot."
luke,Can I have my cookies?
john,You hungry?    You want your sandwich?
luke,No.
nicole,Carrie!  Nicole.
john,I remember.
nicole, Really?
john, I remember your daughter.
nicole,"She's hard to forget.  Oh, this is for you. Luke was supposed to bring it home."
john,He has his father's memory.
nicole,It's for Carrie's birthday party. Please come; I'd love to meet your wife.
john,I'm afraid she can't be there. ...It's complicated.
nicole,"I understand. With me, too. Carrie, come on, time for lunch.  We're going to the cafe on the corner, would you like to join us?"
john,"Oh, we're pretty...you know...."
nicole,Busy?
john,That's true.     And I made those cookies.
nicole,And learned how to pre-package them.
john,"Which requires a considerable amount of machinery. Come on, Luke."
nicole,Do you trade off time with Luke?
john,No. Luke and I are together full time.
nicole,Wow. I guess that's why I see you so much.
john,She'd like nothing better than to be here. With him. Lara. She really misses...all this.
nicole,"I guess it's all about priorities, isn't it?"
john,No.  She's not like that.   She'd...  She's in prison.
nicole,Oh.
john,I don't tell most people.
nicole,I understand.
john,She's innocent. She didn't kill the woman.
nicole,"...Good.   I mean, I'm sure she didn't."
john,We should really be getting home.
nicole," Oh, okay."
john, Thanks for the invitation.    We'll try and make it.
nicole,That would be great.
john,You want to read a letter from Mom?
luke,She didn't write that.
john,"My mistake. Dearest Luke, who I love so, so much. I wish I could have walked you home today, it was so beautiful out."
luke,But what's wrong with her?
john,She's not feeling well.
luke,Why didn't she just stay home?
john,Because sometimes people get so sick you have to go to the hospital to get fixed.
luke,How do you know when you're that sick?
john,The doctors do tests.
john,You okay?
john,Luke!   Time for bed.
john,...What's wrong?
lara,I was only here through the appeal. We knew I'd be moved to a prison.
john,Muncy is the other side of the state.
john,I don't have two weeks!     I need it tomorrow!
eugenie,The title hasn't been cleared -- there is no way that --
john,How much can they give me?!
eugenie,Nothing!
elaine,What are you doing?!   You almost killed us!
john,Are you --?
elaine,Are you out of your mind?!   You don't look?!
john,I am so sorry --
elaine,Get away!     Get away from us!
john,"No, it was a long shot.       Thanks."
meyer, How's Lara?
john,"She's okay.     Thanks, Meyer."
lara,What's wrong?
john,Nothing.
lara,Is it Luke?
john,No. He's fine. I had Meyer see what he could do about not getting you moved. 
lara,"You haven't? YOU haven't? God, John, you are too much. Luke is having a 'hard time' because mommy is in jail for murder, not because daddy doesn't spend enough time with him! Your father was right, you don't live in the same world we do."
john," That's nice, that the two of you talk. What world do I live in, Lara?"
lara,"I don't know, but it's not the real one. I am in here for the rest of my life! And you want me to believe in some fantasy that -- !"
female guard,We good here?
john,Yes.   Sorry.
lara,"Now you come here all long-faced, like you've let me down. What do you want me to do, make you feel better?"
john,Got it.   I'm sorry.
lara,And now you're apologizing.   You really are a gem.
john,What do you want from me?
lara,Nothing. You're too perfect already. You know you never even asked me if I did it. If I killed her.
john, Because I knew you didn't.
lara,Then you'd be wrong.
john,Shut up. I don't care what you say or how you say it. I don't believe you did it and I never will. I know who you are.
john,Thank you.
john,You think?
luke, Girls love them.
john,Hi Mom.
grace,What are you doing here?
john,I've got class.
grace,Five o'clock at night?
john,Yes.  Bye.
john, Back up! Get back!
alex,-- Shoot them both!
john,-- I'll shoot the dog!
alex,-- Shoot the dog!
thug,"-- You shoot the dog, I'll kill you!"
alex,"-- You want the police here, asshole?!"
john,-- Good idea!
alex, -- Put the gun down!
john,-- Call the dog off!!   Put it away!
alex,-- Release!
john,-- Put it away!!  PUT IT AWAY!!
alex,In!   Get in!
john," You, too!"
thug,I'm not getting in there!

alex,You brought him!
david,I didn't bring him!
john,Shut up!
john,On your knees! Hands behind your head!
david,I can't kneel!
john,On the floor!
david,"That's twelve hundred dollars!  Here, take it."
john, Where do you keep your money?!
alex,"Yeah, I'm going to give you my money."
john,I'll shoot you!
alex,You won't even shoot a dog.
john,Tell me!
alex,"Shoot the floor again, impress me."
john,I'm going to kill you both.
alex,"No, I'm going to kill you both."
david,Give him your money!
alex, Keep your dead bitch mouth shut.
david,Stop it!!
alex," See? You aren't going to kill me. That was the worst you can do. So, now you've done it. Go home. I'll come find you and kill you."
john,"Yeah, good shit; high alcohol content."
alex,You going to burn me out?
john,Yeah.    That's what I'm going to do.
david,Oh Jesus.    Oh Jesus.
john,Your money.
alex," This is a meth lab, you idiot!"
john,No.    It was.
alex, My kid is upstairs!!
john,-- What??
alex,MY KID!!
david,Let me go!!
john,Get up there!!
david,The house is going to explode!
john,Is anyone up here?!
david,Don't leave me. I don't want to burn. Don't let me burn.
david,I don't want to die.   I don't want to die.
john,Hi.    What are you doing up?
george,John?    Are you alright?
john,I'm fine.
john,"Hey.   Hey, buddy."
john,What do you say?
luke,Thank you.
john,Give Grandma a big kiss.
luke,I'm too tired to kiss.
john,Luke...
grace,"I'll get lots of kisses next weekend.  We want to take him to the Harvest Festival in Kutztown, where they have the Clydesdales."
luke,"Thank you, Grandma."
john,Bye Mom.
george,Goodbye.
john, Let's go.
luke, Can I carry it?
john,No.    Just what fits in your bag.
luke,....What about my pockets?
john,Daddy will just be a minute.
luke, It's a pony.
nicole,"Those aren't easy to wrap.  You know the party is at eleven, right?"
john,"What time is it?  Nine. Oh, I'm so sorry, I should have looked more carefully."
nicole,It's no problem.  Why don't you go give this to Carrie?
john,"Oh. Actually, I can't stay.   I have to run some errands."
nicole, We'll see you later then.
john,Thanks so much.  If....
nicole,No problem.
phone repairman,"You pissed off somebody, that's for sure."
john,Put the phone down.
lara,John??
john,"Remove your holsters, put them on the floor and get on your knees."
lara, What are you doing here?
john,DO IT!!
john,Tape their hands and feet.  Do it!!
lara,You have to stop this.
john,Tape their mouths!
lara,No.   Stop.
john,Put it on.
lara,WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!
john,Because we have no other choice!! Put it on!  Turn around.
lara,No.
john,NOW!!
lara,No!
john,Okay. Tell your son you aren't coming.
lara,...Where is he?
john,Waiting for you. Tell him you aren't coming.
lara,How can you do this to me?
john,Push send. Tell him I'm not coming back either.
lara,John --
john,Does it look like I'm going home?! Tell him he is alone now and his mother and father aren't coming back!
lara,You son of a bitch.
john,Get out!    Get out!
lara,Where's Luke?! Is he safe?   Where is he?!
john,He's safe!
john,Back away!
john,Get back!
john, Hit the button.
lara, Oh please oh please oh please...
john,It'll be okay.  Look at me! Do what I say; it'll be okay; I promise.
john,Put your hair down.
lara,Why didn't you tell me?
john,You would've stopped me.
detective collero,You want to take a guess who just escaped from jail?
john,Hi.   I'm here for my son.
john,Back from where?
brenda,It's a zoo party. 
lara,What's wrong?
john,He's at the party.
lara,What party?     You said the party was here.
john,I was wrong.     She took them to the zoo.
lara, She?
gps voice,Estimated drive time: seventeen minutes.
john,Carrie's mom. Nicole.
gps voice,Time to destination: eleven minutes.
lara,You took the wrong turn!    It's back there.
john,She'll call my parents.
lara,What??
lara,Are you out of your mind!
john,I tried!! There's no more time!! Any second now there's going to be a roadblock ahead! It might be there now!! If we don't get out now we don't get out!!
john,"No, it really is fine. I can't thank you enough for taking care of him."
nicole,"It is our pleasure.    Wasn't it, Carrie?"
