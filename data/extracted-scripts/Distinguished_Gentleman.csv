Speaker,Dialogue
loretta," Do we have your check yet? Loretta pulls a Mont Blanc pen and a checkbook from her bag. LORETTA No, honey, I don't think you do, we just got in last night from our place in Barbados -- how much is it?"
debbie,Five hundred a person.   Barbados? LORETTA 
debbie,"It's just over there. ON JEFF JOHNSON with his well-groomed wife, VERA, and a barrel-chested Man in full resort wear, wearing an OLAF ANDERSEN name tag. JOHNSON So how the heck are you, Olaf? ANDERSEN I should be asking how you are, congressman. Johnson pats his chest and smiles at Vera. JOHNSON This old ticker never felt better. ANDERSEN It's good to see you back on your feet, Jeff. We need you in Washington. Inconspicuously, a pretty young redhead whispers to Vera. This is JENNIFER, Johnson's Administrative Assistant "
debbie," Let me help you, we'll find it. LORETTA Call Security! 9   IN THE FUNCTION ROOM Tommy maintains his watch on          9 Loretta. Zeke Bridges taps Tommy on the shoulder. ZEKE Hey, what about our drinks? Tommy instantly assumes an ANGRY YOUNG STREET BLACK VOICE: TOMMY Yeah?    What you want? ZEKE What?    You already took our order."
tommy,That wasn't me! You must be thinking of Jamal. I'm Karim. What you want? ZEKE Bourbon straight up and a Perrier rocks. TOMMY 
bruno,"Now just calm down, Ma'am... can you describe the ring? LORETTA It's a diamond ring! A big diamond ring! Oh my Christ! She's frantic.   Debbie takes Bruno aside. DEBBIE I saw it. It's huge... it must be like eight carats. She says it was a quarter of a million dollars! Bruno turns back to Loretta, trying to calm her. "
zeke,"Hey!   Where the hell are our drinks. Surprised, Tommy opts for an EAST INDIAN ACCENT. TOMMY I remember... you were the sloe gin fizz and the mango daquiri? With perhaps a small umbrella for the lady? ZEKE Bourbon neat and a Perrier, dammit! TOMMY And would you still be wanting the umbrella then? "
andersen,"Shoot. Tommy moves away from the pillar, sees Bruno roaming the terrace, and retreats. JOHNSON I'm thinking of retiring from Congress. Andersen's eyes widen in astonishment. ANDERSEN You're what? JOHNSON I'm thinking maybe I won't run. Maybe I should listen more "
andersen,"A few thousand worth of stock options would stand to make you quite a pile. As long as your blind trust buys them, you're clean -- the SEC can't shake a stick at you. Half a million, easy -- and that's just a start. JOHNSON Well, if you put it like that... I now see I have a duty to continue my career in public service. Johnson stands, puts his arm on Andersen. Tommy emerges, shakes his head, and laughs. TOMMY I'm in the wrong business."
dodge,"And now God has called his servant home. ANGLE ON Jennifer, in black. DODGE "
15.,"22   CONTINUED:                                                    22 Vera sneaks a look at Jennifer, who is poker-faced. 23   EXT./INT. VERANDA/JOHNSON HOME - DAY                          23 On the veranda of the gracious  home, mourners pay respects to the family. Dodge   puts a gentle hand on the widow's shoulder and draws  her aside. He throws a look at Jennifer, who joins  them. DODGE Vera, I know you're still in shock from Jeff's... passing. But we have to talk about his seat. Vera stares at Jennifer.   She knows the score."
jennifer,"Mrs. Johnson, if you'd like to discuss this in private -- VERA You can stay -- what's the difference? DODGE Vera, I'd like you to announce that you're going to run for Congress. Let a few days pass to show proper respect. But next week, I want to stand next to you at a press conference where you declare for Jeff's seat in the House. VERA JOHNSON No, Dick -- no."
dodge,"There's nothing to be afraid of, Vera. With your name, you can't lose. People around these parts are so used to voting for Jeff Johnson -- why, Mrs. Jeff Johnson would win in a walk. VERA JOHNSON Dick, I was a Washington wife for twenty years. Twenty years of Potomac bullshit is plenty for one lifetime. DODGE Vera, we're talking about becoming a Member of Congress. We're talking about a sure thing. "
armando,"Ain't no town like that. LORETTA You mean Vegas? TOMMY No.  Washington, D.C.   I'm going to run for Congress. His big smile meets their blank surprise.   Their faces fall. LORETTA What is this, a joke? HOMER I don't get it."
armando,"What's the con, Tommy? TOMMY Van Dyke.   You remember Willie Sutton? VAN DYKE Of blessed memory. TOMMY You remember what he said? They asked him, Why do you rob banks? And he said, That's where the money is. I tell you, people -- Washington. That's where the money is. "
armando,"Who ""we,"" white man? TOMMY You never heard of staff, Armando? I get in, I get a staff allowance of five hundred and thirty-seven grand a year -- Loretta wolf-WHISTLES. TOMMY -- which I will generously share with you. LORETTA And how exactly were you going to get your butt to Congress? HOMER Yeah -- why would anyone vote for you? TOMMY Not for me, Homer. For Jeff Johnson. Name recognition -- that's what it's all about. You think folks know their congressman died? I get on the ballot as Jeff Johnson, I guarantee they'll vote for me. Now all's I have to do is get on the ballot. LORETTA Which is how? "
tommy,"Okay... gimme the four-one-one on these Silver Foxes Again. It's a bunch of old folks who like to vote? VAN DYKE Don't laugh, they get an enormous turnout. But the big thing is, they have their own line on the ballot. They already got the signatures. TOMMY Ah. VAN DYKE The lady we're meeting, Hattie Rifkin, they call her the condo queen. TOMMY So all I have to do is snow one old lady. Don't sound like major surgery."
vera johnson,"Really... well, I'm sure... TOMMY And I was actually in the audience when he said, 'If you people would just get off your dead asses and look for work, this country might be fit to live in again.' Powerful stuff. VERA JOHNSON It's very kind of you to say so. And you're very kind to come all the way from... where was it? "
loretta,"Hello? Who? The League of Women Voters? Sorry, Mr. Johnson won't be attending the debate. No -- no, Betty, I'm sorry, I can't tie up this line. "
cameraman,"Jesus -- he's not... white. I actually voted for the guy. I thought he was Jeff Johnson. Tommy jumps onto a bench.    APPLAUSE from his Supporters. TOMMY Thank you, thank you, all of you, for your help. Give yourself a round of applause. They do. As APPLAUSE continues "
tommy,"Wait here. He heads further into the office. 60   INT. TOMMY'S OFFICE - DAY                                   60 Equally unattractive.   Perched on the desk:   Reinhardt. TOMMY You again! REINHARDT Good morning, congressman. TOMMY What is this shithole? "
rafe,Jeff Johnson? You're Jeff Johnson? The guy from Florida? TOMMY That's right. RAFE 
bo,"You don't remember me? I was a tight end for the Oilers -- my knee gimped out. The origins of the gentlemen's political success is not lost on Tommy. BO Hey, stop by my reception after the swearing in tomorrow, okay? RAFE Yeah, but don't you go to his reception before you go to my reception. "
first member,"So then I ran an ad calling him a draft dodger, but then he ran an ad calling me a plagiarist. SECOND MEMBER What did you do? FIRST MEMBER Oh, leaked a rumor that his father- in-law was a Nazi. I went up ten points in a weekend. TOMMY  We're in the majors, doll. 62A   THE BALCONY is full of people working one another. As      62A Tommy and Loretta pass some large stone statues, a man extends his hand -- liquor lobbyist KEN KORNGOLD."
korngold,"Congressman? I'd like to introduce myself. Ken Korngold. National Distilled Spirits Association. TOMMY Tommy Johnson. Distilled Spirits, is that right? KORNGOLD It's super that you won, congressman. Any way we can help, please don't hesitate. TOMMY Pleasure's all mine, Ken, hope you can make it to my reception. Do you happen to have a card? "
dodge,How do you    do? 
celia,"I want an appointment, Congressman, not a date. TOMMY Yeah, sure, we'll type it up on the schedule, it'll be an appointment, except with wine and flowers on the table. CELIA No thanks.   I really should be going. TOMMY Won't you at least stay for a drink and some herring? "
tommy,"I love the way you say that. She slips out through the sea of revelers. 79   EXT. CAPITOL - DAY                                         79 A fine Washington morning. 80   OMITTED                                                    80 81   EXT. CAPITOL STEPS - DAY                                   81 Rep. ELIJAH MARSHALL, 50s, black, and a pain in Dodge's ass, is shaking hands and saying goodbye to some Constituents. Dodge approaches. "
marshall,"""Isn't perfect""? Dick, your bill's the Incumbents Protection Act! How can you even call it an ethics bill? DODGE Because the public wants an ethics bill! So that's what we call it. MARSHALL But it's got no teeth! It won't change a thing, and you know it. DODGE Come on, Eli, you're a politician, too. The less you're going to do about something, the more you have to talk about it. You know that. They start walking."
marshall,"I see. We close the bank, we stop the rubber checks, we raise the prices in the barber shop, we stop fixing parking tickets, and abracadabra! We say we've cleaned up Congress. Well, I don't think the American people want what this place has become. DODGE That's the beauty of it! They must, Eli -- they keep re-electing us. MARSHALL Not anymore! This new Congress is full of new faces. "
marshall,"Eight point six. DODGE Power and Enterprise is about to fund a solar demonstration plant, Eli. It could mean a whole lot to a district -- new jobs, new construction -- that interest you? MARSHALL You can't bribe me, Dick. 82   INT. DODGE'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY                          82 Dodge and Marshall enter. DODGE Eli, the people who elected you. They sent you here to help them. Don't you want to?"
marshall,Not  if it means supporting your bill. All  you want is the perfect platform to  campaign for Speaker. Dick Dodge. Mr.  Clean. What a joke! DODGE 
dodge,"Most members would give their right nut for it. TOMMY So what do you want from me, Dick? DODGE Congressman... I just want you to smile for the cameras. 84   INT. POWER AND ENTERPRISE COMMITTEE - DAY                    84 The committee members -- all white males, except Tommy -- mill around, awaiting the start of the hearings. As the TV cameras whir, Dodge shakes Tommy's hand warmly. Big smiles and an explosion of flashbulbs. Dodge breaks off and Tommy drifts over to Reinhardt. REINHARDT "
tommy,"Skeeter. WARBURTON Damned fine to meet you. As Dodge and Tommy head for the dais, Tommy imitates Warburton's lockjaw. TOMMY ""Tommy. Please. Been called that since reform school."" Dodge chuckles, shakes his head in mock rebuke. Tommy takes his seat at the lower dais, smiles at the Members on his left and right. "
tommy,"That's all right. They can wait. CELIA Well. She pulls documents from her briefcase and hands them to Tommy. CELIA These are issue papers. This session we're targeting auto insurance premiums, child safety, and food additives.   As votes come up, we know you'll be hearing plenty from the other side. We'd just like a clean shot at making our case, too. "
ira,"I'm away for the next two weeks. She gives him a look.    Ira turns to Tommy. IRA So, when can Celia start your briefings? TOMMY Saturday night? IRA Saturday night sounds fine. CELIA Fine. Wednesday morning.      Nine- fifteen. 90   INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT - CLOSE ANGLE - A SIGN                 90"
marshall,"He took six hundred dollars off you that last hand, didn't he? TOMMY Yeah, he's taking a real shine to me. MARSHALL If I didn't know better, I'd say you lost to him on purpose. TOMMY Nothing wrong with letting the chairman of the ethics committee roll you once in a while. "
teacher,"And what did you vote? TOMMY I voted ""Nay."" It's a terrible bill. It'd destroy the fabric of American life. TEACHER And what was the vote on? Tommy hasn't a clue. He calls out to Rafe, who is among those leaving the chamber. TOMMY Hey, Rafe! Tell these kids what that vote was about. "
tommy,Which means? BO Clean Air. RAFE 
tommy,"You pick. O'CONNOR  Let's put you down as for. Now what about putting limits on malpractice awards? TOMMY You tell me. O'CONNOR Well, if you're for 'em, I got money from the doctors and insurance companies. If you're against 'em, I got money from the trial lawyers. Tell you what, let's say against. Now how about pizza?"
tommy,"So, how'd you end up hustling for Pro Bono instead of pesticides? I mean, you could have been a big- time lawyer, right? CELIA Oh, I was for a while.   It... depressed me. TOMMY At a hundred grand a year, how depressed can you get? Doesn't it depress you to lose all the time? CELIA Sometimes. Mostly it gets me angry. And the anger keeps me going. Sure, I wouldn't mind winning a few. And it's not like I'm allergic to money... TOMMY So why do you do it? She skips a stone on the water. CELIA God, it's so embarrassing to come out and say it. TOMMY Say it. CELIA Meaning. I need my life to mean something. "
marshall,"That would put you somewhere between a lizard and a toad. Quite a step up. Tommy looks from Marshall to Celia and back again. TOMMY How could I have missed the family resemblance? 106   EXT. CANNON BUILDING - DAY - ESTABLISHING                  106 107   INT. CANNON TOP FLOOR - DAY                                107 WHISTLING happily, Tommy rounds the corner and heads to his office. "
tommy,"Wait a minute. You're talkin' 'bout my re-election? DODGE You don't know what percent of the incumbents who ran last time got re-elected, do you? TOMMY Fifty?   Sixty? DODGE Ninety-six. And ninety-eight before that. It's like that election after election. If you don't fuck up, you can be here, raking it in, for life. Life, Johnson. Tommy considers this.   Then a big smile."
tommy,I can think of worse places to get life. DODGE 
armando,"There a problem, congressman? MRS. JUBA Congressman?   You? Armando tries to escort her out. MRS. JUBA Get your hands off me! Mickey tries to block Armando. MICKEY Let go of her, you creep! "
tommy,"But why isn't it being investigated? CELIA Why didn't they investigate breast implants all those years? What about those side-effects of that sleeping pill, Halcion? Why isn't anything being investigated? It's always the same. TOMMY Money talks. CELIA You got it. "
andersen,"Mr. Chairman! DODGE Mr. Chairman! Hello, Tommy. Zeke you're looking well, good to see you. ZEKE "
tommy,"But there are studies that say -- ZEKE For every study that says one thing, I'll show you a study saying another. We've studied it ourselves. Nada. ANDERSEN There's not a single state health official anywhere in this country who says power lines cause cancer. TOMMY But what if you're wrong? As Tommy persists, Andersen looks increasingly angry. TOMMY People didn't use to say smoking causes cancer, either. What if the evidence is just building, and some day we wake up and discover that your power lines are killing us? ANDERSEN "
zeke,"You kill the insurance companies. O'CONNOR You kill the school district. ANDERSON You kill the local economy. DODGE For a smart boy, you're not thinking very politically. Tommy watches the LIGHTNING. TOMMY Maybe I should think about it. "
tj,"Can you do that?     I thought there were limits -- O'CONNOR Oh, it's all aboveboard, we all believe deeply in the rules. It's just that the state rules are often more flexible about these things. ANDERSEN Are you interested? TJ I'm always interested in the happiness of my constituents. DODGE I'll drink to that."
marshall,"This is the U.S. Congress! The American people deserve better than -- DODGE You know what your problem is, Eli? You've got sermonitis. The other Members chuckle. DODGE Can't open your mouth without climbing into the pulpit, can you? Why don't you just calm down, have a massage -- MARSHALL I've got news for you, Dick. I'm going to run against you for Speaker. I may not have a rat's ass of a chance to beat you. But I sure as hell can tell the world the kind of sleaze you stand for. 121   EXT. CAPITOL TERRACE - DAY - TOMMY AND DODGE               121 DODGE I went too far with him, I know it. You know him pretty well, don't you? TOMMY Oh, I don't know... DODGE Come on, you play basketball together, you're seeing his niece, you've been to his church -- TOMMY How did you know that? "
dodge,"That's right.     Is there a problem? TOMMY No, no -- I've still got my right nut, I can work with that. 122   INT. CRAB HOUSE - NIGHT                                     122 A WAITER removes an empty pitcher of beer. WAITER Another? TOMMY Sure, why not. Marshall takes a boiled crab from the platter between them, places it on the butcher paper in front of him, christens it --"
marshall,"The honorable Dick Dodge. -- raises a big wooden mallet, and SMASHES it on the crab, smiling. TOMMY You know, Eli, sometimes people do things they regret. Everyone makes mistakes. Fact is, Dick's been under a lot of pressure lately -- MARSHALL That man's a walking quid quo pro -- prid quo -- quid pro quo, and you know it. He put you up to this, didn't he? "
marshall,"You know why no one on the Hill drops a dime on anyone else? Mutual assured destruction. Our little gentleman's agreement. Everybody has something on somebody, so nobody has anything on anybody, because everybody wants to save his own ass. TOMMY  Oh, yeah? What do they have on you? MARSHALL They think I'm a pompous ass. TOMMY Shit, that ain't no secret. 123   EXT. CRAB HOUSE - NIGHT                                     123"
marshall,"Entirely mine. TOMMY You know Reinhardt, my AA? Marshall nods.   Reinhardt turns to Tommy. REINHARDT Excuse me, congressman, could I just do a couple of quick calendar things with you? MARSHALL "
dodge,"Listen carefully. Tell the ambulance to take you to Walter Reed. It's a privilege they give congressmen. It's also the only hospital without a bunch of goddam reporters shtupping the nurses in exchange for leaks. They'll keep it quiet. I'll handle the police. You go home and keep your mouth shut. 134   INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT                                134 Two figures approach one another in the shadows: Reinhardt, and the Taxi Driver who rear-ended Marshall's car. The cabbie nods.   Reinhardt hands him an envelope. The Driver inspects the cash."
correspondent,"Right you are, Tom. How this plays into his longstanding campaign to reform congressinoal ethics is now anyone's guess. WASHINGTON ANCHOR Thank you.   In other news... Tommy leaps for his clothes. 137   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY                                 137 Tommy races down the corridor.   Ahead of him, Celia, coming out of Marshall's room.   She freezes at the sight of him. "
homer,"Congressman, I have information I think you may want. It's about something going on at the EPA. TOMMY What have you got? HOMER I got a wife and three kids, and a note on my house, that's what I got. "
homer,"In the right hands, it could mean a great deal. TOMMY Okay. Sunday. Fifth race at Del Mar. Blueboy is running twenty to one. I'd take a major position. HOMER You have to be shitting me. TOMMY No, not at all -- my Cousin Henry spends his days pumping water into horses' stomachs and stuffing Percodan up their butts. Trust me. Reinhardt is interested in this.   And he admires Tommy's m.o."
third member,"Unless there is further business, our caucus stands adjourned. Dodge gets up.    As he makes to leave, Tommy comes in. TOMMY Got a minute, Dick? Tommy takes him aside.    The room empties except for them. TOMMY Listen, Dick, I heard something. There's got to be some bid'ness in it. Tommy very discreetly gestures with his thumb and palm: money. TOMMY Maybe we can go in on it together."
dodge,"I'm listening. TOMMY The EPA is going to make a stink about power lines. The White House is pushing them to do a big study. DODGE That's very interesting, my friend. I've heard that, too. TOMMY "
tommy,Olaf? 
dodge,"Exactly.   A little access, that's all. 154   INT. ORNATE CAPITOL HALLWAY - DAY                         154 Dodge, Andersen, Tommy, and O'Connor walking along. Up ahead, a cocktail reception. On an easel by the door: HAZARDOUS WASTE ASSOCIATION MEET YOUR REPRESENTATIVE NIGHT. DODGE I've got to do a drop-by. You gentlemen like to join me for a drink? 155   INT. ORNATE FUNCTION ROOM - DAY                           155 Dodge and Tommy work the room genially. Tommy spots Celia talking to some Guests and goes over to her. "
tommy,"Come to the Clean Air hearing tomorrow. CELIA  What? TOMMY Power and Enterprise.    Noon. CELIA But why? He gives her an enigmatic smile and slips away. As he rejoins Dodge, Tommy SEES WARBURTON enter the room. Alarmed, TOmmy moves in on Dodge, steering him to avoid the EPA Administrator."
tommy,"Shouldn't we be heading off, Dick? DODGE Let's work the room just a bit more. REINHARDT "
dodge,"At a hazardous waste event?  You don't understand -- he's the perfect man. TOMMY But -- but you don't want to bother him with this. Talk to one of his underlings -- Dodge looks at Tommy with curiosity, not understanding his reluctance."
dodge,"Nothing beats man-to-man. TOMMY Here?     Not here! DODGE A public place. What could be better? TOMMY But it's the wrong time! DODGE While the iron is hot, son. "
tommy," You heard about this stomach thing going around? DODGE Come on, son, we've got the people's business to do. He leads Tommy off to one side.      Reinhardt brings Warburton to them. WARBURTON Mr. Chairman.    Congressman. DODGE I've got a big problem, Skeeter. WARBURTON What's that?"
dodge,"Your power lines investigation. WARBURTON What power lines investigation? Tommy is sweating bullets. DODGE We're off the record, Skeeter. This witch-hunt for cancer clusters is bad news for everyone. WARBURTON I don't know what you're talking about, Dick. "
warburton,We didn't speak on the phone. DODGE 
tommy,"Morning, Reinhardt! Got a minute? I need your advice on something. REINHARDT Sure. Tommy leads him back into the corridor. 157   INT. TOMMY'S BOILER ROOM - DAY                          157 Van Dyke, Armando, and Loretta work the phones. VAN DYKE Is this the assignment desk? Yes, I'm calling from Chairman Dodge's office, on the Hill. We wanted to be sure CNN was sending a crew to the Clean Air hearing today."
tommy,"He's do that? REINHARDT For some flattery? In a New York minute. Just tip him ahead of time. TOMMY Good thinking. They return to the corridor.     Tommy looks at his watch. TOMMY Say, Reinhardt, my Grandma's plane comes in at ten. You wouldn't mind picking her up and driving Miss Daisy around, would you? REINHARDT Can't one of the others do it?"
tommy,"No, I don't trust them the way I trust you. TOMMY pats him on the back and sends him on his way. 159   INT. TOMMY'S OFFICE - DAY                                    159 Tommy, joined by his cronies and the Jubas. TOMMY This is it, people.     Game time.   Let's get it right. ARMANDO Tell me one thing, jefe. How do you know Andersen is going to bite? TOMMY I don't.   You run a con, you run a risk."
celia,"You got that right. AT THE DAIS Tommy has a private word with Dodge. TOMMY Dick, I thought it might be a nice way to open if I congratulated you on the fine work you been doin' on this committee. Really express our appreciation. Especially on behalf of the minority community. DODGE Why, thank you, son. "
reinhardt,"No, Mrs. Johnson, you must be mistaken -- let me introduce you. This is Mr. Yancey of the EPA. GRANDMA  What the -- ?"
tommy,"Yes, courage, Mr. Chairman, is a quality that you have in abundance -- DODGE Well, yes, thank you, but we have to move along, if the gentleman would -- TOMMY  these gentlemen here. Chairman Dodge and I listened in astonishment as Olaf Andersen offered us seven figures -- that's one million dollars, ladies and gentlemen."
mickey,"Now? Tommy shakes his head again.    No. ANDERSEN What about the two hundred k for your phony foundation, Dick? How about the ten thousand copies if your goddam autobiography you muscled me to buy -- what's all that, ancient history? Andersen advances toward the dais, pointing now to six or seven other Members of the Committee among the total of 28. ANDERSEN And you -- what about those bundled checks from my executives? I gave you my condo in Vail! I gave you my corporate jet to fly all over the world! I gave your kids summer jobs! I put up scholarships to put your kids through college! I hired your goddam wife to redecorate my office! You telling me none of that counts for anything? Andersen grabs Dodge by the throat. ANDERSEN I thought you people were for sale! I was wrong -- you're just for rent! Dodge struggles free of Andersen, who is dragged away from Dodge by Capitol Police. "
mickey,"Throw the bums out! LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE.   She's touched a nerve.   TJ leaps into the moment. TJ Damn straight! Throw the bums out! This place is an outhouse! ON THE PUBLIC. GASPS, WHOOPS, and APPLAUSE.    Reinhardt sinks lower and lower into his seat. VOICES "
dodge,"Ladies and   gentlemen, I have here some rather   startling revelations about this   Mr. Johnson before you. This man is   nothing but a con man! A fresh BUZZ from the room. DODGE A common grifter!  A fugitive from justice for card sharping, bookmaking, confidence games --"
tommy,"Adjourned? Fine. Leave.  I'm a con man. A small-time con man. Do you know what it was like for me to come to Congress? It was for like dying and going to heaven. If I did back home the kind of scams I've run in Congress, my ass would be in Sing Sing. But no, I'm not a crook -- up here, I'm a distinguished gentleman!"
voices,"Throw the bums out! Throw the bums out! Tommy is engulfed by people and lights. Dodge, Andersen, and O'Connor -- desperate, snarling -- are pinned to the wall by the SHOUTING Press Corps. Loretta AND GRANDMA watch Tommy bask in his new notoriety. LORETTA That Miss Oprah's gonna love his ass. "
