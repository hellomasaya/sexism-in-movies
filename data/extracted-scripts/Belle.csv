Speaker,Dialogue
lady mary,"Elizabeth Murray, bring yourself back here this very moment!"
lord mansfield,What in God's name have you done!!
lord mansfield,A detail you chose NOT to share.
lord mansfield," Captain Sir John Lindsay, do you find me a fool? She is a MULATTO!"
lord mansfield,How do we raise her...?
lord mansfield,She takes your name?
lady mary,"We cannot have another Elizabeth in the household. LADY MANSFIELD regards the child, then looks to her husband, gravely. He turns his back - aggrieved."
lady mansfield,"We...we will call her Dido.  Good Lord, she is thin. Mary, find her something to eat. LORD MANSFIELD storms from the room. LADY MANSFIELD follows. LINDSAY kneels, choked with emotion."
lady mary,You little....
lord mansfield,"D'you see here...? This..this is your grandfather, Sir Alexander Lindsay of Evelick."
dido,Elizabeth's papa.
lord mansfield,"Indeed. He discovered her mother aboard a captured Spanish slave ship. He was charged with conveying it back to these shores, he tells me. LADY MANSFIELD Evidently he had some...`feeling' for the woman. LORD MANSFIELD  Elizabeth was much in need of a companion."
lady mansfield,"And that is what we shall say when questions are asked of us? LORD MANSFIELD We shall say that in accordance with her birthright, she is entitled to live beneath this roof.  Such...is the nature of `order'."
lady mansfield,And where in this `order' should her colour be placed? Below or above her Murray bloodline? ...NOT...in company. We cannot escape society's confines on etiquette LADY MANSFIELD Marriage?
lord mansfield,"Impossible. Any match her..'other origins' may attract would surely disgrace her and the family rank. LADY MANSFIELD And when we are no longer here? No husband - who will take care of her? He rubs his eyebrows, perturbed, turns back to the lawns."
reverend davinier,"...for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. So saith Christ the Lord. Amen. CONGREGATION Amen.  A FLAME as a YOUNG MAN lights a candle by the altar. He sings, choir-like, the word `amen' rather than simply saying it. REVEREND DAVINIER Hymn no. 76. ON the MANSFIELDS as the congregation begins to sing."
dido,"Have I wronged you, Papaa?"
lord mansfield,You have done no such thing.
lord mansfield,"I have not past experience in the ways of breaking grave news to you. He hands her a letter and she reads. A beat, as the news resonates through her, silently. Her pained gaze slowly rises to meet LORD MANSFIELD'S."
dido, I thought I should one day have the opportunity to make his better acquaintance. LORD MANSFIELD Yes.   I know.
elizabeth,"Two thousand pounds a year? ELIZABETH sits at the edge of the bed in day clothes. DIDO nods, her back to us as she stares out through the window. ELIZABETH  Then you are an heiress! He has left you your fortune!"
dido,He did not know me.
elizabeth,"My father's new wife wishes him to leave me not a thing, and he obliges her."
dido,"Then it is her cruelty you should lament, Bette, not his stupidity. ELIZABETH I think he might have loved me more if Mamaa had not died."
dido," I...I think love must be a very complicated thing.  ELIZABETH lifts her head to look across at DIDO. ELIZABETH Dido - with such a dowry you may marry into any good family you wish. OFF DIDO as she stares at the ceiling, daunted."
elizabeth,Visitors? Who ever bothers to visit us here? DIDO Or leave... except the dead!
dido,"I will do your hair, Bette. Oh say we may wear them, Aunt Mary."
lady mary,"You will not be dining with us, Dido."
dido," Yes of course. But I may join after dinner, may I not?"
lady mary,"Yes. Such are the rules, and you know them well."
lord mansfield,"Dinner with guests is a formal proceeding, Dido - we simply cannot impose the disregard of those formalities upon visitors. DIDO But...Papaa, am I not..'wealthy', now...an heiress? Surely that changes matters... LORD MANSFIELD "
elizabeth,There you are. I have been searching for you! LADY MANSFIELD  What a wretched countenance!
lady mary,"She deplores my authority. What am I in this household, if not the `observer of rules'?!"
elizabeth,I would rather dine with Dido!
lady mansfield,What a great pity
lady mansfield,"Our young gentlemen guests shall miss you, Elizabeth. Both girls' eyes widen - DIDO's with disappointment."
lady mansfield,And most agreeable by all accounts! ELIZABETH'S mouth falls open. LADY MARY leans toward her.
lady mary,"Close your mouth and understand: There shall be no discussions tonight in any languages other than English! No whisperings in gentlemen's ears - not in Latin, Italian...and certainly not French!"
elizabeth,"I said...`Your hands have the suggestion of a sensitive man'. She wrinkles her nose, minxish. Across the table... LADY ASHFORD I must say, the entire country barely breathes awaiting your judgement on this appeal. Terrified you shall destroy England, no doubt. I know Lord A is. He does wonder though, what can be taking you...so long? LORD MANSFIELD  Your husband of all people knows this. LADY MARY My brother is not a man of rash instinct. LADY MANSFIELD For that we are all grateful."
lady ashford,"What a lot of fuss over dead cargo. LORD MANSFIELD It is a fuss over the bread and butter of a great many in these isles. A great many, Lady Ashford.  OFF LORD MANSFIELD'S distaste...."
wimbridge,"Miss Lindsay? DIDO There are poachers wandering...! The sound of the echoing doorbell, jolting DIDO. Her eyes dart to the door. WIMBRIDGE hesitates, then answers."
dido,"Sir, I do not believe we have been introduced! JOHN takes hold of himself, half mortified, half irritated. JOHN Indeed. I...I...  Please inform the lady of my apologies for startling her. I took advantage of the back fields, by way of a short-cut to deliver this to Lord Mansfield... from my father."
wimbridge,Sir? He hands WIMBRIDGE an envelope. JOHN Reverend Davinier.
wimbridge,"Of course, sir. I will see that he gets it immediately..."
john,"Yes, of course...thank you. He backs away. DIDO still shows him nothing but her back."
wimbridge,"Good night, sir. He moves off, and is gone as DIDO finally turns, stares at the closed door, flushed."
lord mansfield,Dido...my dear.
lady ashford, ...a lady.
oliver,"Capital! LADY ASHFORD I hadn't expected her to look so...black. OLIVER Mamaa, did you not listen to the rumours when you were spreading them? DIDO curtseys respectfully to LORD MANSFIELD. LORD MANSFIELD May I present to you the second of my nieces - Miss Dido Lindsay."
oliver,"A pleasure, Miss Lindsay."
elizabeth," He is the eldest - to inherit the entire Ashford fortune. He is also to inherit from his uncle - a healthy man, who shows little sign of departure."
dido,How do you know?
elizabeth,Lady Ashford herself. She seems rather despondent at her brother's robust constitution.
james,I find her repulsive. OLIVER I suppose she is...if you find a most rare and exotic flower so. She is quite something to behold.
james,"One does not make a wife of the rare and exotic, Oliver. One samples it on the cotton fields of the Indies..."
oliver,"So far, when it is right at my door?"
james,...Then finds a pure ENGLISH rose to decorate one's home. OLIVER smiles. OFF both men - trained on DIDO.
lady mansfield, Any day now.
oliver,She is an heiress. A seamless change of heart for LADY ASHFORD. LADY ASHFORD Although exceptions can be made.
oliver,It is said that her father left her a rather vast fortune.
lady ashford,"I mean to say, if that is your inclination."
oliver,She is rather soft on the eye - I have thought no further Mamaa.
lady ashford,From where did you receive your information? OLIVER Her sister-cousin has a rather fast tongue.
oliver,"Oh do not be selfish with your good fortune, m'lord! A beat...then put on the spot, LORD MANSFIELD caves, throwing up his hands, helplessly."
lady ashford, Hers was a most diligent governess.
lady mansfield,"Well, that, at least, is true,  Indeed, it is Elizabeth who needs to secure her bread and butter."
elizabeth,A portrait? Are you sure?
dido,Yes...Aunt Mary has confirmed it.
elizabeth,Good Lord. How...truly wonderful.
dido,"But...but... ELIZABETH  But what, Dido?"
lord mansfield, Miss Lindsay.
lord mansfield,"Decide what? She is hesitant now, awkward in JOHN'S presence."
dido,If he should...should WANT to paint me!
lord mansfield,The man is to be paid a fortune. What is there to decide?
dido,But...
lord mansfield,"Dido, you are to simply sit still. Not a challenging task! DIDO  Next...next to Elizabeth...?"
lord mansfield,As you always are - right beside one another. DIDO's chest heaves with distress. JOHN Should...should not any lady be flattered to be such a subject?
john,"Quite! Though one should be forgiven for thinking he was in the presence of a lady - when she is, in fact, still a juvenile! DIDO Papaa, may we do this in private!"
lord mansfield,"Not now, no! You may return the books to the library. DIDO Papaa...!"
john,"I am no member of the nobility - I have little, but...where my father relies on the bible, I...I wish to rely on the law courts. LORD MANSFIELD You aspire to the judiciary?"
lord mansfield,"Noble if not pompous! A country lawyer, you may make - perhaps! If you pay every regard to what you are taught - but you have neither the rank nor finances for any more!"
john," If I may, m'lord - neither did you!"
lord mansfield,I beg your pardon?
john,"Well...as a fourth son, you had rank but not the income to pay for your qualification to the Inns."
john,"That I do not know, M'lord. I have not yet been afforded those considerations...but I know a country life does not suit me."
john,"Silence speaks volumes. Elizabeth approaches, calls out, as she curtseys."
elizabeth,Papaa's new student.
john,"Indeed! DIDO Mr Davinier, my cousin, Elizabeth. JOHN A pleasure."
dido," Truth is, there have been more of your sex at Kenwood this week, than I've previously seen in all my entire life! DIDO flushes."
john,Hopefully we have not disappointed! ELIZABETH On the contrary! She raises a minxish eyebrow and moves off. Awkward silence.
dido,"Mr Davinier, what...what is the importance of the Zong... why is the case before Papaa's court, the supreme court...? He searches her, taken aback.   Why is she asking him?"
john,Well...  It is a cargo ship.
dido,I...I am aware of that.
john,"A human-cargo ship. DIDO hesitates, tentative."
dido,Oh. You said those who were drowned.
john,It lost most of its slaves before arriving at its destination.  Drowned - by the crew on the captain's order.
dido,But...why?
maid,"Miss, your supper is served now in the ladies' parlour."
dido,"Thank you. JOHN hesitates, struck with confusion at the maid's words. DIDO becomes awkward. LADY MANSFIELD emerges, disappearing into the dining room. LADY MANSFIELD Mr Davinier, will you be joining us for dinner? JOHN's eyes dart to DIDO - sees her unease. It pierces him."
john,"I..er...I thank you, Madam, but I am promised to the company of my aunt this evening. She has recently moved to the cottage at Belsize. LADY MANSFIELD Of course - as you wish."
john,Forgive me...but twice now I have seen...I have seen you separated from the gathering. DIDO's cheeks begin to burn.
dido,No. It's a statement of mine!
lord mansfield,"I cannot disagree. JOHN One hundred and thirty two drowned on route from Africa to the West Indies. Your ruling could bring the slave trade to its knees - entirely destroy an economic foundation of these lands.  Is that pressure not maddening, m'lord? LORD MANSFIELD reigns in his horse. He quotes in Latin."
lord mansfield,"Justitia fiat, ruat coelum, Mr Davinier - Let justice be done, though the heavens may fall. JOHN The insurance claim states, the slaves were thrown overboard for the safety of the ship - that there wasn't sufficient water for the cargo and crew to survive the rest of the voyage. LORD MANSFIELD It does."
john,"Then, if I am correct, the case hangs on..."
lord mansfield,...IT HANGS on `Absolute necessity'. If the cargo was spoiled... JOHN Cargo? LORD MANSFIELD adjusts his language.
lord mansfield,If the killing of the..'negros' was truly `necessary' in order to save the ship - as the captain contends.
john,"With due respect... I should question, whether 'human' life should have been insurable as cargo - at all. The air turns cold."
lady mary,"A gentleman rather like him once paid me much interest. ELIZABETH Mr Davinier? LADY MANSFIELD  Really, Mary? DIDO lays each Dahlia carefully."
lady mary,Do not look at me like that! It was my Mamaa who intervened. I thought he had a very great sense of duty. Overly kind at times but... LADY MANSFIELD watches as though she knows the rest.
dido," But...what, Aunt Mary?"
lady mary,Engaged! ELIZABETH Is he? LADY MANSFIELD Mr Beresford's daughter.
elizabeth,"The carriage-maker! He might have set his sights a little higher! AS JOHN marches toward the back entrance of the house. He nods to the ladies. A self-conscious beat between he and DIDO, her back to him - as he disappears inside."
zoffany,"To the window, Miss Lindsay DIDO favours the window a little more...Soft sunlight pours onto her skin."
john,"I...I was curious... DIDO Quite a task - to sit for so many                       * hours...... Congratulations! I learned of your..your match..yesterday.                            * JOHN Thank you. He falters slightly, swallows hard - not all is well."
john,Perhaps yours is a life less concerned with such matters. DIDO Why do you judge me so? He studies her. She is tentative.
john,"Are you at utter disconnect from everything?! He searches her, making her feel very small and ashamed. As he moves off, she stares after him, distressed."
dido,Mr Davinier...please. Tell me. Tell me what you know!
john,I can only tell you what I believe.
dido, And what...what is that?
john,"The slaves were intentionally drowned, that is not in question. Chained! Thrown into the waters - chained together as one. "
john,Yes. They are challenging the decision of the lower court - refusing to pay for murdered slaves.
dido,Thank you.
elizabeth,"There you are! DIDO is frozen, says nothing. ELIZABETH stares from the doorway - why does DIDO look so strange? ELIZABETH  We are requested. You - drawing room. I, relegated to the ladies' Palour!"
lady mansfield,We are to attend London for the Season. ELIZABETH'S eyes are wide.
dido,We are to finally `come out'??
dido,"But why? LORD MANSFIELD You understand the ways of this world for a female, Dido. Elizabeth has no income. When all this is gone to her father, I have nothing to leave her."
dido,And me?
lord mansfield,"Dido, you are well taken care of - Of this, you are well aware."
lady mansfield,Lord knows I will need you both to keep each other out of trouble.
dido,"Papaa... LORD MANSFIELD You are not to be denied, Dido."
dido,"Are...are you punishing me? LORD MANSFIELD Punishing you!! Dido, you are most cherished. Most loved. Why ...why would you say such a thing? DIDO Because..."
john,"Because they were! Those slaves were diseased - some were already dying - yes. But it was essential they die ON the journey or they would not come under insurance consideration! Neither too, if they had expired of their diseases - That is why they were killed - this we all know!"
lord mansfield,You have entered my home and utterly taken advantage of the confidential matters afforded you.
john,These `matters' have been for public consumption for months. Miss Lindsay is no child...no.. fool!
lord mansfield," Her precious care is in my hands and I will decide when she is ready for such realities. Not the son of a vicar! A vicar who, incidently purchased his living from me!"
john,"I shall gather my belongings. LORD MANSFIELD Do so! LORD MANSFIELD turns his back on JOHN to glare at the lawns JOHN calmly collects his books, jacket, hat. He hesitates."
john,"Your Lordship, a question? LORD MANSFIELD swings round ready to bite.. LORD MANSFIELD WHAT, Mr Davinier!"
john,As the mere son of a vicar - I wonder whether the value you extend to your very precious mulatto niece - well I wonder if it amounts to MORE...or LESS than the thirty pounds insurance the traders are asking for each life they murdered? ON LORD MANSFIELD'S cold stare.   He swallows hard.
lord mansfield,"Mr Davinier. JOHN stops, turns to LORD MANSFIELD."
elizabeth,"John Davinier is leaving very early today! DIDO moves to the window. Her POV: JOHN on horseback as he disappears over the brow. ELIZABETH, LADIES MANSFIELD and MARY watch as LORD MANSFIELD storms past the doorway.- all is not well, they can tell. LORD MANSFIELD's gaze locks with DIDO through the doorway - he falters, moves on. OFF DIDO's realisation - JOHN is not coming back ."
elizabeth,"I could fall in love with such a man, Dido. LADY MARY Love?"
dido,Relieved?
elizabeth,That you shan't be at the caprice of some silly Sir and his fortune!  The rest of us haven't the choice! Not a chance of inheritance if we have brothers and forbidden from any activity that allows us to support ourselves.
lady mansfield,"Light the fires for dinner, will you, Thomas. ON MABEL as she catches DIDO'S stare, forcing DIDO to avert her gaze quickly, turning her back to distance herself."
mabel,"Some bed socks for you, Miss Murray, Miss Lindsay. It's not as warm as we hoped tonight"
mabel,"Can I help you with that, Miss Lindsay?"
cut to:,"Candle lit faces... DIDO's reflection in the mirror - her hair separated into four sections. In the reflection BG, ELIZABETH sits serenely watching MABEL brushing through each section from ends to roots."
lady mansfield,"Promise me you will change that vulgar teal paint, if you ever become lady of this home. It is positively wanting, Elizabeth."
lady ashford,Grenadine syrup... LADY MARY And port!! LADY MANSFIELD Which has gone to my head already!
dido,What a dreadful shame.
dido,"Thank you. He places it in the water, stands and examines DIDO. From afar, LADY MANSFIELD watches. OLIVER Miss Lindsay, would you do me the honour of taking some air with me, some time? DIDO is dumbstruck - what to say? JAMES is halted. JAMES Don't you care what people will say"
james,"That he should compromise a lady's reputation by stepping out with her - scarcely having made her acquaintance! OLIVER I think you are a great deal too anxious, brother. We should merely take a turn around Vauxhall. DIDO observes JAMES - His protestation is bitter. She traces OLIVER'S features, warmly. DIDO I should be delighted, Mr Oliver! Most delighted."
lady mansfield," I am not at ease with this. Lord Mansfield would be most aggrieved. LADY ASHFORD Oh it can do no harm. This is simply two families, enjoying a day together. LADY MANSFIELD takes an unhappy breath, burdened."
oliver,"Well I did not think I would ever find a lady who was not to be conquered or ignored...Until you. DIDO Ah now how do I know this is not just another tactic in your battle to conquer? He stops, takes her hand and places it on in his chest."
oliver,See how my heart beats.
oliver,"He cannot overlook your mother's origins, as I do. Foolish. Why should anyone even pay her regard when your better half has equipped you so well with loveliness and privilege."
dido,What a lovely sound.
oliver,"You are unrelentingly cultured. Come, let's find it! He takes her waist spinning her round with him into another pathway, disappearing from the others, giggling as they go."
lady mansfield,People will think she has no family! LADY ASHFORD. People will think they are courting! LADY MANSFIELD and LADY MARY exchange a look. LADY MARY is somehow softened - her eyes appeal to LADY MANSFIELD...
lady mary,Let her enjoy his society. LADY MANSFIELD is effected - reads MARY'S emotion. 61.2: An open pavilion with classical concert. ON OLIVER and DIDO watching.
oliver,"I might only have dreamed of these moments, at one time."
john,Miss Lindsay. DIDO  Mr Davinier. How...how nice to see you.
john,"And you, Miss Lindsay. He looks to OLIVER."
dido,"Forgive me - Mr Ashford, may I present to you...Mr Davinier. "
dido,Elizabeth and Mamaa are here... in fact.
cut to:,61.3. The spit and bang of spectacular fireworks. OLIVER stands engrossed as the sky lights up. DIDO looks up at him. She wavers. Then...slowly she backs away from the crowd
john," Miss Lindsay, you are alone!!"
dido,I did not have the chance to see you before you left...Mr Davinier ...to convey my apologies.
john,Apologies...?
dido,Your pupilage. Father would never have ended it...you...you never would have had to leave Kenwood were it not...
john,"He would make mine a living hell, were he to know of us speaking. DIDO tugs him into a quiet lane, away from the concert and promenading."
dido,"What are you doing here in London Mr Davinier? JOHN I am under a third cousin - a solicitor, here. Nothing more than petty disputes between unsavoury landlords and debauched tenants, but I cannot discount it. DIDO Not what you wished for. JOHN I haven't given up on The Inns. Nothing worth having in life comes easily. DIDO  Where are my manners? I trust the future Mrs Davinier is well."
john,Very well...thank you.
dido,"I have tried to keep up - with the Zong. These past weeks. JOHN  What price, a worthless Negro."
john, I am with others here. We are all students in law - applying pressure on the insurance companies to refuse from here on to insure slaves on any ship. A simple clause. DIDO But that would require a change of law. I know nothing but...
john,"A change in law - something the insurance companies can lobby for IF they can be persuaded to band together.  Someone has to have the courage. How can we expect to be civilised if we live in a barbaric world. His words wind her as JOHN shakes his head, frustrated. She takes him in - he is so very handsome!"
dido,"No we cannot risk it. He nods - studies her.... JOHN Good bye, Miss Lindsay.  I suspect, we will never see each other again. The thought strikes DIDO, uneasily. DIDO Good bye, Mr Davinier."
dido,Quite.
oliver,I did not dare return to Lady Mansfield without you.
dido," I..I am terribly sorry. I thought I saw the others, I went after them....and found myself lost. OLIVER studies her - she is so nervous...what is she hiding? A moment - then his eyes become forgiving."
cut to:,"61.7 ON LADIES MANSFIELD, MARY, ASHFORD, seated on a bench. LADY MANSFIELD It's almost dark!"
lady ashford,"Look, here are James and Miss Murray. ELIZABETH and JAMES approach, sit on the bench opposite. ELIZABETH I do hope you know how well I think of you."
james,As I do you.
elizabeth,"Then I hope, Sir, you plan to honour your attentions...as not to would leave me looking... quite foolish. JAMES And I should not call myself a gentleman! Satisfaction washes over her. As DIDO and OLIVER appear, LADY     * MANSFIELD lets our a cry of relief, goes to say something -       * LADY ASHFORD lays a finger across LADY MANSFIELD's lips.          *"
lady ashford,"Say nothing! This has all been for the good of the future, I assure you!"
lady ashford,She will need a gentleman who can temper her. Quite a task.
lady mansfield, Do I sense that an address is finally to be made? LADY ASHFORD goes carefully...
lady ashford,She is an exquisite girl...  And...since there is no male heir and...it will therefore fall upon Elizabeth and her husband to eventually inherit all of Kenwood and its lands...
oliver, Your brother needs a wife who will bring him further land! LOTS!... if he is ever to exert more political influence than your father has. JAMES But what of her own father?
lady ashford,The Seventh Viscount Stormont is a scoundrel. Ensconced in Vienna with the girl's vicious step-mamaa and his new offspring - who I am told is to inherit EVERYTHING.
james,She has the colouring of a farmer.
lady ashford,"James, we do not talk about that, any longer."
james,"Is this really the very best you aspire to, Oliver? To introduce some woman of obscure birth into the family lineage? LADY ASHFORD James - you are my first boy - blessed by law to inherit your father's wealth. Be sympathetic to your brother. Like the unfortunate Miss Murray - a good family name and empty pockets will only get him so far!! OLIVER closes his eyes, privately humiliated."
lady mary, Mabel! Freshen the flowers!
dido, Is Mabel a slave? LADY MANSFIELD almost chokes on her porridge. LORD MANSFIELD I beg your pardon?
dido,"Is-Mabel-a-slave! LORD MANSFIELD swallows hard, his jaw tightens."
lord mansfield,She is free and under our protection.
dido," O! Like me! ELIZABETH Hardly, Dido! LORD MANSFIELD And paid a very respectable wage."
dido,"The marine insurance. It is a Fraud case, is it not? LORD MANSFIELD That would depend on to whom you may speak."
dido,"To cull your `cargo'? To do it solely to claim insurance because it was too diseased to achieve a good price at market? If not fraud, then what? LORD MANSFIELD Do you speak on my behalf, Dido?"
lady mansfield,Oh will you please stop! She slams down her napkin. LADY MANSFIELD  This is a vulgar subject to be discussing at breakfast
lady mary,"I learned yesterday that Mr Davinier is in town. DIDO stiffens. ELIZABETH stares across at her, privately. LORD MANSFIELD Makes sense. Dido is beginning to sound very much like him.  DIDO has lost her appetite. DIDO Excuse me. She gets up and is gone."
lord mansfield,Spit it out. LORD ASHFORD Her introduction to society comes at a key time in the insurance appeal. Parliament is nervous that your `family situation' will colour your judgement. LORD MANSFIELD I will neither be pressured from the inside - or the outside. LORD ASHFORD comes to a stop.
lord mansfield,"How? RULES are in place to dictate how we live - were that not the case, I would not have had the mandate to give shelter to my nephew's child."
lord ashford, I believe you. He raises an eyebrow. Then...
lord mansfield,Is that so?
lord mansfield,"We are.  You once asked me, who would look after her when we are gone. Money is no substitute for a man's protection. I cannot deny her a match so suitable."
lady mary,"He never married. Cousin Marjorie wrote me last year, that he had died after a long illness."
elizabeth,Oh Aunt Mary...
mabel,"Pardon me. Mr Ashford is here for you, miss. DIDO and ELIZABETH look back at her, then at each other."
oliver,"Hello, Miss Lindsay. DIDO Mr Oliver. OLIVER I do hope my reason for being here will bring you as much happiness as it brings me. DIDO swallows hard. In the CORRIDORS - LADIES MANSFIELD and MARY listen through a crack in the doorway."
oliver,So I feel my career is now set. All that remains... A long beat. OLIVER gathers his courage...
lady mary,"I cannot see...! LADY MANSFIELD Shooosh! On the stairs, ELIZABETH slows, as she approaches."
elizabeth,"What are you doing? LADY MANSFIELD Quiet, Elizabeth! In the DRAWING ROOM - DIDO is still staring at the ring."
dido,"Good Lord, Mr Oliver! Your ...your wife? Mrs Ashford?!"
elizabeth,"Agreed? LADY MANSFIELD throws open the doors, elated."
lady mansfield,O...!
dido," Perfect, Bette - pefect. CUT TO:"
dido,Papaa.
elizabeth,"Should we not wait a day or two - for Mr James? LADY MARY Elizabeth - some advice.     Wait for no man, dear!"
dido,"I..I am terribly light headed this morning, Mamaa. I should like to take rest if it would not displease you. LADY MANSFIELD Oh dear! Unwell? And just as we are to announce your news!"
dido,Harry! Harry!
harry,Mr Davinier?
john,Harry?
john,I didn't expect...! Are you to come inside?...Are...? DIDO No...It would be dangerous. JOHN  Yes. Indeed. DIDO Oh Mr Davinier...I am so proud of you. I am so proud of what you are doing and...achieving.
john,"No. We've achieved little.... She lifts his face to hers, earnestly."
dido,At least thirty per cent of insurers are with you! It is a start. It is a real start.
john,"Good Lord! DIDO And they did not! They either ignored the possibilities, or they were never in need."
dido,"Is it? Perhaps if you made these facts known, Mr Davinier JOHN But this places you in an impossible position with Lord Mansfield."
dido,What is the alternative? His face searches hers...
john,"Walk with me, Miss Lindsay. The back of the Inn has the canals,  Nobody but blind drunks."
mabel,"Yes. She is, M'lord. LORD MANSFIELD watches as she stiffly moves from the room. He goes to ask something more...then thinks better of it."
dido,"Papaa would rather I see no ill, as though by ignoring it, it some how escapes me - perhaps by position but not...not by blood"
john," The fault was never with you. He stops a beat as he catches her gaze on a painted metal sign swinging from the back of an inn. It shows a gent, hat in hand, his black servant bowing behind him."
john,You were afraid.
dido,Afraid?
john,To be painted - to be painted beside Miss Murray  I feel ashamed.
dido,Do not feel ashamed.  we are but their property.
john,Whose?
dido,"Gentlemen's. We women are but the property of gentlemen. That is the way it is, in law and in life, is it not? JOHN nods, uneasily.    DIDO thinks aloud."
john,"I suppose you have, yes! DIDO Or have I?  It seems silly - like a free negro who begs for a master! JOHN Unless she marries her equal. Her true equal - A man who respects her."
john,Mine? DIDO  What of your mother?
dido,"She is a ghost in my life - present in my reflection, in each scowl I receive, yet I know very little of her than the colour she has given me. JOHN  Then at the least, you know she was beautiful. They come to a halt. DIDO's eyes begin to sting. DIDO I had never felt it."
john,"Had? They observe each other a moment. Will they kiss? Dido pulls back, nervous of the intimacy. DIDO I am to marry, shortly - Mr Ashford."
dido,He is amiable and of good family. JOHN Is it...what you want? She stops.    The question strikes her.
dido,The alternative is to replace Lady Mary in her responsibilities at Kenwood.
john,But she is a spinster.
dido,Papaa did not trust I could achieve a match that might raise my rank - or even equal it.
mabel,Lord Mansfield.  I said you were out with Lady Mansfield and Miss Murray
elizabeth,Urghhh! What if I shall never find someone so...so incomparably suitable...and wealthy?! DIDO What if he is suitable but you do not feel...`yourself' with him? ELIZABETH Oh Dido! He understood me.  And whenever...whenever... he looked at me...I somehow felt better in this world...
dido,"Oh Bette, stop it! It is NOT love!! ELIZABETH Dido! You stop it, won't you? You know no more of love than I myself, do you?!  Do you Dido?"
elizabeth,Then what better right do you have to name what I am feeling than me? OFF DIDO affected.
lady mansfield,"How charming. Is that not charming, Elizabeth? And tell me, are you an only son?"
gentleman 1,"I have six brothers, madam."
lady mansfield,SIX! Goodness!...all..?
baroness vernon, AND I see the other does not give up...so terribly endearing!
elizabeth," Mamaa, Mr Vaughan approaches."
elizabeth," Oh most certainly. MR VAUGHAN Miss Murray, I wonder, if you might permit me to call upon you at home, sometime?"
elizabeth,"Oh! She looks to her mother, stunned, his gaze follows..."
mr vaughan,"With her Ladyship's permission? LADY MANSFIELD I shall make arrangements. ON DIDO, as OLIVER chats to others. She moves past as..."
lady ashford,A pity Lady Mansfield and I could not do business on James and Miss Murray.
lady mary,A greater pity you rejected her.
lady ashford,"Let us not dwell on the unfortunate. Oliver and Miss Lindsay are a blissful match. Tell me, when exactly does she receive her inheritance? As DIDO observes her reflection in waters - easy laughter floats by - a group of gentleman josh."
dido,"Oh, Mr James, your manners are as poor as your brother's finances."
james,And you are foolish enough to marry him. I on the other have no better use for your impoverished cousin!......Though she does make for rather amusing sport!
dido,It is not in my repertoire to keep company with beasts.
elizabeth,Oh!..Mr James!
dido,Is she not terribly disappointed that you will not return to Hampstead?
john, my Aunt?
john,Were you a curious child?
dido,"Completely. Elizabeth, always asked the questions for me... then took blame for the impropriety when in fact she was protecting me! Dear, dear Bette."
john,That...that is a fact. A tear spills. As JOHN'S hand come up to wipe it away...  CUT TO
dido,Then he is not a man of his word.
elizabeth,You would do that? For me?
dido,"Bette, anything for you!"
elizabeth,Dido...
elizabeth,Then I cannot thank you enough.
dido,Bette...?
elizabeth,I will ask Papaa to write immediately to Lady Ashford. DIDO No!
elizabeth,"No? DIDO gets up too, now. DIDO James Ashford is not kind. He is not a man to give your life or dowry to. ELIZABETH Then your gift comes with conditions. DIDO No!"
elizabeth,What then? DIDO I am trying...trying to make you see. He is not... appropriate!
elizabeth,Appropriate? The brother of the man you are to marry is not `appropriate' for me?
dido,"He does not desire you, Bette! At least, even if he does, you would regret such a mistake.  He...he laid his hands on me, Bette - in the most un-gentlemanly fashion. ELIZABETH Why should you say such a thing?"
dido,He hurt me. ELIZABETH You are a liar! DIDO Why...why would I lie to you?
elizabeth,I don't know - but do you not see? Have you never been able to see? He would never touch you...!
dido,Bette...
elizabeth,You are beneath him!
dido,I am beneath him??
elizabeth,Yes. You...you are...
dido,"What! Tell me! What am I, Bette? She dares ELIZABETH to cross their line of sisterhood."
elizabeth,...You...you are.......You are illegitimate!!
lord mansfield,"This man's ambitions include you. You will endure shame and risk your position for a man without name, who will sully yours and drag your reputation to the gutter! JOHN  I take great offence in your summation of my character without ever even taking a moment to know me. Where is your right? LORD MANSFIELD ...I have EVERY right...!"
john,"...No! That you will never have! Not until you cease from judging the entire world as those above and those below and begin to see people as PEOPLE! Human beings, who think and feel no more or less than you do!"
john,"No! I have an ambitious aunt in Belsize, who like you, assumes reputation and fortune are all that life depends on, and despises love as though it were the devil's own creation! LORD MANSFIELD's eyes narrow dangerously - rage explodes."
lord mansfield,Love? You claim love....??
dido,"NO! STOP! Papaa, you must stop!"
john,Yes...yes I love her! I love her with every breath I breathe. Silence! DIDO and LORD MANSFIELD are stunned. A painful beat.
dido,"Go John.   You do not deserve this. JOHN'S breath is heavy, his heart pounding. He catches his breath, almost chokes on it as he rises, moving with uncertainty from the carriage, and is gone. DIDO stares at LORD MANSFIELD.  DIDO  Is that what you want?  No, perhaps it isn't! DIDO stands wavering - daunted."
lady mary,"The niece of the Marquess of Winchester. Mr James Ashford is to marry the niece of the Marquess of Winchester. ELIZABETH looks up, bewildered.  LADY MARY  That shall render your future mother-in-law ecstatic, Dido. ELIZABETH slams her book down, gets up and storms off. DIDO thinks about it a beat, uncertain then goes after her."
dido,"I won't. ELIZABETH Why! Why do they ALWAYS do that!! DIDO Who, Bette?"
elizabeth,Men! They leave and never come back!
elizabeth,"I saw you with him, that day.   At the pleasure garden. DIDO You said nothing."
elizabeth,I wanted you to tell me. To trust me.
dido,I should have.
elizabeth,"You know, if I had your choice, I would choose...the man I loved  I simply hope he is worth it."
lady ashford,"I am not in the habit of requiring explanation more than TWICE! But on this occasion, you will have to forgive me."
lord mansfield, Lady Ashford there is little point in repetition...
lady ashford,Then let me be clear that I have understood. Your charge - your mulatto charge...
lady mansfield," That is enough! DIDO sits staring at the floor. OLIVER cuts in, aggrieved..."
oliver," Is it not true enough, your ladyship?!!"
lady ashford,"...whose unfortunate circumstances of birth, we chose to forgive - has decided she no longer wishes the match with my son - a gentleman and an officer. OLIVER stares across at DIDO. He speaks quietly... OLIVER Why, Miss Lindsay?"
lady ashford,...Does she still have a tongue?
dido,"I have a tongue, Madam. Though yours explains well enough why I may not marry your son...beat)... You view my circumstances as unfortunate, though I cannot claim even a portion of the misfortune of those to whom I most closely resemble. ON LADY MANSFIELD stung by the thought. DIDO  My greatest misfortune would be to marry into a family who will carry me as their shame - as I have been required to carry my own mother."
dido,"Why did I, slave, beyond my lot aspire.. The line repeats itself in her head."
dido,"Why should it not? LORD MANSFIELD says nothing, observes her, curious. LORD MANSFIELD What are you reading?"
dido,Poetry. A gentleman named Thomas Day. He speaks of a slave who agreed to marry a free woman. A voice to people...people like my mother - who do not have one.
lord mansfield,You find yourself in such writing?
lord mayor,"Look at them - For and against at each other's throats! How on earth did the damn quakers find their way into here!....You are a brave man, negotiating these quarters on the eve of your judgement."
lord mansfield,"You did not become Lord Mayor through being a coward. LORD MAYOR Finally you are to speak, then. If England is destroyed we shall blame you! He slaps LORD MANSFIELD's back, playfully, but is deadly serious. LORD MANSFIELD is distracted...through the bustle in the room, the SOUND of YOUNG MEN debating at a table, insurance underwriters before them."
john,"And failing that does the law not have a duty? ON LORD MANSFIELD - his own group continue in conversation, but all his attention is on JOHN. JOHN  A constitution can never be finite - surely as humanity evolves so too must its laws. And frankly I really do not care if you as an individual are without character or conscience - But a land whose laws contain neither - whose laws sanction not control the barbarous among its citizens - that is a country whose hope is lost.  LORD MANSFIELD's gaze falls away, as he swallows hard."
lord mansfield,"Why does it matter to you so? JOHN stares at him bewildered, at a loss for words."
john,M'lord..! It..it is a misuse of the clause. It is not for human lives. It is for goods.. Chattel...
lord mansfield, It is for property! JOHN I HAVE SEEN YOUR NOTES!! If they wanted water they could have had it!
lord mansfield,Dido.
john,"If you find for the traders, you will be formalizing in law the concept of insuring `human' cargo."
john,"Then know that when you are gone, your legacy will be to have left Miss Lindsay in a world that says she may be worth more dead, than alive. LORD MANSFIELD She is not a slave. JOHN By the very grace of God!"
lord mansfield,"This is not about Miss Lindsay. JOHN is confused, flustered. JOHN Of course it is! It's about all of us. It's about everything... everything that is important!"
harry,NO! Never again!
dido,Fine! Then step down and allow me to take the reigns.
clerk,Silence in the court! DIDO's hand slides to JOHN'S.
lord mansfield,"Whether the `jettison clause' of Marine Insurance Law may be brought to bear in this appeal. This is the question. That is, first: whether the slaves were drowned as an anticipatory act. An act to avoid the disease caused by their "
lord mansfield,The ship's owners chose a tight `packing fashion' to transport the slaves...A popular fashion of transportation that is known for causing death and disease.
clerk,All rise!
lord mansfield,"I am fully aware, Dido."
dido,"And Mr Davinier is not a gentleman? Her voice rings out, furious. LORD MANSFIELD stops..."
lord mansfield,"He is...indeed...Dido.  My affections are with him, Papaa. I wish for nothing... nothing, if not to be his wife."
john,Your Lordship? LORD MANSFIELD And if you think it a good idea...I wish to facilitate your entry to the Inns of Court.
john," That is to serve my qualification to The Bar? The question LORD MANSFIELD once put to JOHN, is now answered."
lord mansfield,"Indeed......Capabilities such as yours are clearly deserving of such considerations. JOHN breathes heavily, also humbled, as his tears surface."
john,"I..I think it a very good idea, sir."
dido,"Of course. He sees what I see. His words were as clear as... JOHN No! That your feelings for me are so? That you would be my wife..?  I love you...for all that you are, and with all..all that I am.  He breaks down now too, wiping her tears before kissing her through his own sobs. Then tears turn to laughter.  We draw back on the couple - two fragile figures, amid the bustle of London town. ON the MANSFIELD crest as LORD MANSFIELD'S carriage moves off, a solitary figure inside, staring straight ahead.
