Speaker,Dialogue
gentleman,"Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd. His skin was pale and his eye was odd. He shaved the faces of gentlemen Who never thereafter were heard of again. He trod a path that few have trod, Did Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street."
banker,"He kept a shop in London town, Of fancy clients and good renown, And what if none of their souls were saved? They went to their maker impeccably shaved..."
banker,"By Sweeney, By Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street."
ghosts,"Swing your razor wide, Sweeney! Hold it to the skies! Freely flows the blood of those Who moralize!"
general,"His needs were few, his room was bare:"
priest,A lavabo and a fancy chair...
tourist,"A mug of suds and a leather strop, An apron, a towel, a pail and a mop..."
student,"For neatness he deserves a nod, Does Sweeney Todd..."
gentleman,The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.
ghosts," Inconspicuous Sweeney was, Quick and quiet and clean `e was. Back of his smile, under his word, Sweeney heard music that nobody heard. Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned, Like a perfect machine 'e planned, Sweeney was smooth, Sweeney was subtle, Sweeney would blink and rats would scuttle..."
ghosts," Sweeney was smooth, Sweeney was subtle, Sweeney would blink and rats would scuttle. Inconspicuous Sweeney was, Quick and quiet and clean 'e was, Like a perfect machine 'e was, Was Sweeney! Sweeney! Sweeney! Sweeeeeneeeeey! On this explosive note we revolve -- away from the ghostly Furies--"
ghosts,Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd. He served a dark and a vengeful god. What happened then--
gentleman,"Well, who's to say?"
banker,"And he wouldn't want us to give it away,"
ghosts," Not Sweeney, Not Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street."
anthony,"I have sailed the world, beheld its wonders From the Dardanelles To the mountains of Peru, But there's no place like London--!"
todd,"No, there's no place like London."
anthony,Mr. Todd...?
todd,You are young. Life has been kind to you. You will learn.
anthony,"Lord ... takes your breath away, doesn't it?"
todd,"There's a hole in the world Like a great black pit And the vermin of the world Inhabit it And its morals aren't worth What a pig could spit And it goes by the name Of London. At the top of the hole Sit the privileged few Making mock of the vermin In the lower zoo, Turning beauty into filth and greed. I too Have sailed the world, and seen its wonders For the cruelty of men Is as wondrous as Peru, But there's no place like London!"
todd,"I beg your indulgence, Anthony ... My mind is far from easy. In these once familiar streets I feel shadows everywhere..."
anthony,Shadows...?
todd,Ghosts.
todd,"There was a barber and his wife, And she was beautiful, A foolish barber and his wife, She was his reason and his life, And she was beautiful, And she was virtuous. And he was...  Naive."
anthony,"And the lady, sir ... did she succumb?"
todd,"Oh, that was many years ago... I doubt if anyone would know."
todd,"I owe you my life, Anthony. If you hadn't spotted me, I would be lost on the ocean still ... Thank you."
anthony,"Will I see you again? TODD You might find me, if you like, around Fleet Street."
anthony,"Until then, my friend."
todd,There's a hole in the world Like a great black pit And it's filled with people Who are filled with shit And the vermin of the world Inhabit it...
todd,"Isn't that a room over the shop? If times are so hard, why don't you rent it out?"
todd,Haunted?
todd,Transported? What was his crime?
todd,..... NOOOOOO!
todd,Would no one have mercy on her?
todd,Where's Lucy?! Where's my wife?!
todd,He? Judge Turpin?
todd,Fifteen years of sweating in a living hell on a false charge. Fifteen years dreaming that I might come home to find a loving wife and child...
todd,"No, not Barker. That man is dead. It's Todd now. Sweeney Todd ... And he will have his revenge."
todd,Judge Turpin and the Beadle will pay for what they did.
todd,First I must have my shop back.
todd,I don't believe it...
todd,"Silver, yes..."
todd," You there, my friend, Come, let me hold you."
todd,Leave me now...
todd,At last my arm is complete again.
ghosts,"Lift your razor high, Sweeney! Hear it singing, ""Yes!"" Sink it in the rosy skin Of righteousness!"
ghosts," His voice was soft, his manner mild. He seldom laughed but he often smiled, He'd seen how civilized men behave. He never forgot and he never forgave, Not Sweeney, Not Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street."
johanna,"Green finch and linnet bird, Nightingale, blackbird, How is it you sing? How can you jubilate, Sitting in cages, Never taking wing? Outside the sky waits, Beckoning, beckoning, Just beyond the bars. How can you remain, Staring at the rain, Maddened by the stars? How is it you sing Anything? How is it you sing?"
johanna,"My cage has many rooms, Damask and dark. Nothing there sings, Not even my lark. Larks never will, you know, When they're captive."
beggar woman,"Alms! ... Alms! ... For a miserable woman On a miserable chilly morning...  Thank yer, sir, thank yer."
anthony,"Ma'am, could tell me whose house this is?"
beggar woman,That's the great Judge Turpin's house that is.
anthony,"And the young lady who resides there? BEGGAR WOMAN That's Johanna, his pretty little ward. Keeps her snug, he does, all locked up ... So don't you go trespassing there or it's a good whipping for you -- or any other young man with mischief on his mind..."
beggar woman,"'Ow would you like a little muff, dear, A little jig jig A little bounce around the bush? Wouldn't you like to push me parsley?"
beggar woman,Alms! ... Alms!... For a desperate woman...
anthony,"I feel you, Johanna, I feel you. I was half convinced I'd waken, Satisfied enough to dream you. Happily I was mistaken, Johanna! I'll steal you, Johanna, I'll steal you..."
judge,"Come in, lad. Come in..."
judge,"... you were looking for Hyde Park, you say?"
anthony,"Yes, it's terribly large on the map but I keep getting lost..."
judge,"Sit down, lad, sit down."
anthony,"It's embarrassing for a sailor to lose his bearings, but, well, there you are."
judge,"A sailor, eh?"
anthony,"Yes, sir. The ""Bountiful"" out of Plymouth."
judge," A sailor must know the ways of the world, yes? ... Must be practiced in the ways of the world ... Would you say you are practiced, boy?"
anthony,Sir?
judge,"Oh, yes ... such practices ... the geishas of Japan ... the concubines of Siam .. the catamites of Greece ... the harlots of India ... I have them all here ... Drawings of them .... "
judge,Would you like to see?
anthony, I think there's been some mistake--
judge,"Oh, I think not. You gandered at my ward, Johanna ... You gandered at her ... Yes, sir, you gandered."
anthony, I meant no harm--
judge,"Your meaning is immaterial. Mark me: if I see your face again on this street, you'll rue the day your bitch of a mother gave you birth."
judge,My Johanna isn't one of your bloody cock-chafers! My Johanna is not to be gandered at!
beadle,"Hyde Park is that way, young sir ... A right and then a left, then straight on, you see? ...  ... Over there."
beadle,"You heard Judge Turpin, little man."
beadle,Next time it'll be your pretty brains all over the pavement.
anthony,"I feel you, Johanna, And one day I'll steal you. Till I'm with you then, I'm with you there, Sweetly buried in your yellow hair..."
todd,He's here every Thursday?
todd,Not for long.
todd,By tomorrow they'll all be flocking to me like sheep to be shorn--
todd,"I will do what I have vowed to do ...  ... Come closer, my friend, closer..."
toby,"Ladies and gentlemen! May I have your attention, perlease? Do you wake every morning in shame and despair To discover your pillow is covered with hair Wot ought not to be there? Well, ladies and gentlemen, From now on you can waken at ease. You need never again have a worry or care, I will show you a miracle marvelous rare, Gentlemen, you are about to see something wot rose from the dead!  On the top of my head."
toby,"'Twas Pirelli's Miracle Elixir, That's wot did the trick, sir, True, sir, true. Was it quick, sir? Did it in a tick, sir? Just like an elixir Ought to do!  Does Pirelli's"
todd," Pardon me, ma'am, what's that awful stench?"
todd, Must be standing near an open trench!
toby,"Buy Pirelli's Miracle Elixir: Anything wot's slick, sir, Soon sprouts curls. Try Pirelli's! When they see how thick, sir, You can have your pick, sir, Of the girls!"
todd, What is this?
todd,Smells like piss.
todd,This is piss. Piss with ink.
toby,"Let Pirelli's Activate your roots, sir--"
todd,"Keep it off your boots, sir-- Eats right through."
toby,"Yes, get Pirelli's! Use a bottle of it! Ladies seem to love it--"
pirelli,"I am Adolfo Pirelli, Da king of da barbers, da barber of kings, E buon giorno, good day, I blow you a kiss!  And I, da so-famous Pirelli, I wish-a to know-a Who has-a da nerve-a to say My elixir is piss! Who says this?!"
todd,"I do.  I am Mr. Sweeney Todd of Fleet Street. I have opened a bottle of Pirelli's elixir, and I say to you that it is nothing but an arrant fraud, concocted from piss and ink."
todd,"And furthermore --   ""signor"" -- I have serviced no kings,   yet I wager I can shave a cheek with   ten times more dexterity that any   street mountebank."
todd,You see these razors?
todd," I lay them against five pounds you are no match for me. You hear me, sir? Either accept my challenge or reveal yourself as a sham."
todd,"Friends, who's for a free shave?"
todd,Will Beadle Bamford be the judge?
beadle,"Glad, as always, to oblige my friends and neighbors  ... Let the challenge commence!"
beadle,Ready?
pirelli,Ready!
todd,Ready.
beadle,"The fastest, smoothest shave is the winner."
pirelli," Now, signorini, signori, We mix-a da lather But first-a you gather Around, signorini, signori, You looking a man"
pirelli,"To shave-a da face, To cut-a da hair, Require da grace Require da flair, For if-a you slip, You nick da skin, You clip-a da chin, You rip-a da lip a bit Beyond-a repair!"
pirelli,"To shave-a da face Or even a part Widout it-a smart Require da heart. Not just-a da flash, It take-a panache, It take-a da passion For da art."
pirelli,"To shave-a da face, To trim-a da beard, To make-a da bristle Clean like a whistle, Dis is from early infancy Da talent give to me"
beadle, The winner is Todd.
pirelli," Sir, I bow to a skill far defter than my own."
todd,"The five pounds. Pirelli produces a distinctive chatelaine purse and removes a five pound note, gives it to Todd:"
pirelli,"Here, sir. And may the good Lord smile on you --  -- Until we meet again."
pirelli,"Come, boy."
toby,"We're pulling out, sir?"
pirelli," We're pulling out, yes. Quickly."
eager customer,"Mr. Todd, sir, do you have an establishment of your own?"
todd,"I thank you for your honest adjudication, sir. You are a paragon of integrity."
beadle,"Well, I try to do my best for my friends and neighbors ... Your establishment is in Fleet Street, you say? TODD Yes, sir."
beadle,"Then, Mr. Todd, you will surely see me there before the week is out."
todd,"You will be welcome, Beadle Bamford, and I guarantee to give you, without a penny's charge, the closest shave you will ever know."
gentleman,Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned. Like a perfect machine 'e planned...
banker,"Barbing the hook, baiting the trap, Setting it out for the Beadle to snap..."
general,"Slyly courted 'im, Sweeney did, Set a sort of a scene 'e did..."
todd,Of course.
todd,"Why doesn't the Beadle come? ""Before the week is out,"" that's what he said."
todd, And the Judge? When will we get to him?
anthony,"Mr. Todd! Thank God I've found you --  ... Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me..."
anthony,"A pleasure, ma'am --  -- You see, there's a girl who needs my help -- such a sad girl, and lonely, but beautiful too and--"
todd,"Slow down, Anthony."
anthony," ... It must be a sign that Johanna wants me to help her -- that's her name, Johanna -- and Turpin that of her guardian. A judge of some sort..."
anthony,"... I've met him, Mr. Todd, and he is - - unnatural ... Once he goes to court, I'm going to slip into the house and release her -- and beg her to come away with me. Tonight."
anthony,"Yes, but -- you see -- I don't know anyone in London --  -- and I need somewhere safe to bring her till I've hired a coach to take us to Plymouth."
anthony,"If I could keep her here, just for an hour or two, I would forever be in your debt."
anthony,"Thank you, ma'am ...  ... Mr. Todd?"
todd,The girl may come.
anthony," Thank you, my friend. He goes."
todd,For a few hours? Before he carries her off to the other end of England?
todd, What's this?
todd,Go -- keep the boy below with you.
pirelli,"Signora, is Mr. Todd at home?"
toby,Ma'am...?
pirelli," Yes, yes, whatever you like."
pirelli,Mr. Todd.
todd,Signor Pirelli.
pirelli," Call me Danny. Daniel Higgins' the name when it's not professional ... I'd like me five quid back, if'n ya don't mind."
todd,Why?
pirelli,"Because you entered into our little wager on false pretenses, me friend ... And so you might remember to be more forthright in the future, you'll be handing over half your profits to me, share and share alike..."
pirelli,... Mr. Benjamin Barker.
toby,To tell the truth --  -- it gets awful hot. 31   INT. BARBER SHOP -- DAY                                        31
pirelli,"... yes, this will do very nicely ... You don't remember me. Well, why should you? I was just a down and out Irish pug you hired for a couple of weeks -- sweeping up hair and the like -- "
pirelli,"So, do we have a deal, or should I run down the street for me pal Beadle Bamford? What do you say to that now, Mr. Sweeney T--?"
toby, -- Oh God! He's got an appointment with his tailor--
toby,"If he's late, he'll blame me--!"
toby,"Signor, you got an appointment..."
todd,Signor Pirelli has been called away. You better run after him.
toby,"Oh no, sir. I better wait for him here or it'll be a lashing. He's a great one for the lashings."
todd,"So, hmmm, Mrs. Lovett gave you a pie, did she?"
toby,She's a real lady. Model of all true Christian virtue.
todd,"That she is ... that she is. But if I know a growing boy, there's still room for some more pie, eh?"
toby,"I'd say, sir --  -- An aching void."
todd,"Then why don't you run downstairs and wait for your master there? There'll be another pie in it for you, I'm sure..."
toby,"No, I should stay here."
todd, I know   -- why don't you tell Mrs. Lovett   I said to give you a nice big tot of   gin?
toby," Gin, sir?! Thanking you kindly, sir! You're a Christian indeed!"
gentleman,"His hands were quick, his fingers strong. It stung a little but not for long."
student,And those who thought him a simple clod Were soon reconsidering under the sod...
tourist,"Consigned there with a friendly prod From Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street."
judge,"This is the second time, sir, that you have been brought before this bench. Though it is my earnest wish to ever temper justice with mercy, your persistent dedication to a life of crime is an abomination before God and man."
judge,I therefore sentence you to hang by the neck until you are dead and may the Lord have mercy on your soul.
judge,This court is adjourned.
beadle,"Thank you, your Honor. Just the sentence we wanted."
judge,Was he guilty?
beadle,"Well, if he didn't do it, he's surely done something to warrant a hanging."
judge, What man has not?
beadle,Sir?
judge,"No matter -- Come, walk home with me. I have news for you, my friend. In order to shield her from the evils of this world, I have decided to marry my dear Johanna."
beadle,"Ah, sir, happy news indeed."
judge,"Strange, though, when I offered myself to her she showed a certain ... reluctance."
beadle,"Excuse me, my lord, May I request, my lord, Permission, my lord, to speak? Forgive me if I suggest, my lord, You're looking less than your best, my lord, There's powder upon your vest, my lord. And stubble upon your cheek, And ladies, my lord, are weak."
judge,"Stubble, you say? Perhaps at times I am a little overhasty with my morning ablutions... BEADLE  Fret not though, my lord, I know a place, my lord, A barber, my lord, of skill. Thus armed with a shaven face, my lord, Some eau de cologne to brace my lord And musk to enhance the chase, my lord, You'll dazzle the girl until She bows to your every will."
judge,"A barber, eh? Take me to him."
beadle,"I am honored, my lord. His name is Todd ... Sweeney Todd. And he is the very last word in barberin'."
toby,"Weaned on the stuff, I was. They used to give it to us at the workhouse, so's we could sleep. Not that you'd ever want to sleep in that place, ma'am. Not with the things wot happen in the dark."
toby,Leave the bottle.
todd,He won't be back.
todd,He recognized me from the old days. He tried to blackmail me -- half my earnings.
todd,Send him up.
todd," Send him up, woman."
todd,Anything you say.
todd,The Judge.
todd,Justice ... Justice.
judge,Mr. Todd?
todd,"At your service ... An honor to receive your patronage, my lord."
judge,"You know me, sir?"
todd, Who in this wide world is not familiar with the honored Judge Turpin?
judge,These premises are hardly prepossessing and yet the Beadle tells me you are the most accomplished of all the barbers in the city.
todd,"That is gracious of him, sir ...  ... Sit, if you please, sir. Sit."
todd,"And what may I do for you today, sir? A stylish trimming of the hair? A soothing skin massage?"
judge,"You see, sir, a man infatuate with love, Her ardent and eager slave. So fetch the pomade and pumice stone And lend me a more seductive tone,"
todd,The closest I ever gave.
judge,"You're in a merry mood today, Mr. Todd."
todd," 'Tis your delight, sir, catching fire From one man to the next."
judge,"'Tis true, sir, love can still inspire The blood to pound, the heart leap higher."
both,"What more, what more can man require--"
judge,"Than love, sir?"
todd,"More than love, sir."
judge,"What, sir?"
todd,Women.
judge,"Ah yes, women."
todd,Pretty women.
todd,"Now then, my friend. Now to your purpose. Patience, enjoy it. Revenge can't be taken in haste."
judge," Make haste, and if we wed, You'll be commended, sir."
todd,"My lord...  And who, may it be said, Is your intended, sir?"
judge,My ward.
judge,And pretty as a rosebud.
todd,Pretty as her mother?
judge, What? What was that?
todd,"Oh, nothing, sir. Nothing. May we proceed?"
todd,"Pretty women... Fascinating... Sipping coffee, Dancing..."
judge,Silhouetted...
todd,Stay within you...
judge,Glancing...
todd,Stay forever...
judge,Breathing lightly...
todd,Pretty women...
both,Pretty women! Blowing out their candles or Combing out their hair...
todd,"Even when they leave, They still Are there. They're there."
both,"Ah, Pretty women..."
todd,At their mirrors...
judge,In their gardens...
todd,Letter-writing...
judge,Flower-picking...
todd,Weather-watching...
both,"How they make a man sing! Proof of heaven As you're living-- Pretty women, sir!"
judge,"Pretty   women, yes! Pretty   women, sir! Pretty   women! Pretty   women, sir!"
todd,"Pretty women, here's to Pretty women, all the Pretty women--"
anthony,Mr. Todd! I've seen Johanna! She said she'll leave with me tonight--!
judge,You! -- There is indeed a higher power to warn me thus in time--
judge,Johanna elope with you? Deceiving slut! -- I'll lock her up in some obscure retreat where neither you nor any other vile creature shall ever lay eyes on her again--!
judge,"And as for you, barber, it is all too clear what company you keep. Service them well and hold their custom -- for you'll have none of mine."
anthony,Mr. Todd -- you have to help me -- I've talked to Johanna and--!
todd,"OUT! OUT, I SAY!"
todd,I had him -- and then--
todd,I had him! His throat was bare Beneath my hand--!
todd," No, I had him! His throat was there, And he'll never come again!"
todd,When?!
todd,Why did I wait? You told me to wait! Now he'll never come again...
todd,There's a hole in the world Like a great black pit And it's filled with people Who are filled with shit And the vermin of the world Inhabit it-- But not for long!
todd,"They all deserve to die! Tell you why, Mrs. Lovett, Tell you why: Because in all of the whole human race, Mrs. Lovett There are two kinds of men and only two. There's the one staying put In his proper place"
todd,"No, we all deserve to die! Even you, Mrs. Lovett, Even I. Because the lives of the wicked should be--  Made brief. For the rest of us, death Will be a relief-- We all deserve to die!"
todd,"And I'll never see Johanna, No, I'll never hug my girl to me--"
todd,Finished!
todd,"All right! You, sir, How about a shave? Come and visit Your good friend, Sweeney--!"
todd,"You, sir, too, sir-- Welcome to the grave! I will have vengeance, I will have salvation!"
todd,"Who, sir? You, sir? No one's in the chair-- Come on, come on, Sweeney's waiting! I want you bleeders!"
todd,"You, sir -- anybody! Gentlemen, now don't be shy! Not one man, no, Nor ten men, Nor a hundred Can assuage me-- I will have you!"
todd,And I will get him back Even as he gloats. In the meantime I'll practice On less honorable throats--
todd,"And my Lucy lies in ashes And I'll never see my girl again, But the work waits, I'm alive at last"
todd,"Later on, when it's dark, we'll take him to some secret place and bury him."
todd,Shame?
todd,Ah!
todd,"Mrs. Lovett, What a charming notion,"
todd,"Eminently practical and yet Appropriate as always. Mrs. Lovett, how I've lived without you All these years I'll never know! How delectable! Also undetectable."
todd,For what's the sound of the world out there?
todd,Those crunching noises pervading the air?
todd,"It's man devouring man, my dear,"
todd,And who are we To deny it in here?
todd,"Ah, these are desperate times, Mrs. Lovett, and desperate measures are called for."
todd,What is that?
todd,Is it really good?
todd, Awful lot of fat.
todd,Haven't you got poet Or something like that?
todd, Mmm. Heavenly.
todd,If it's for a price.
todd,Anything that's lean.
todd, Is that squire On the fire?
todd,Looks thicker. More like vicar.
todd,"The history of the world, my love--"
todd,--Is those below serving those up above.
todd,How gratifying for once to know--
both, --That those above will serve those down below!
todd,Too salty. I prefer general.
todd,What is that?
todd,"Put it on a bun.  Well, you never know if it's going to run."
todd,"No, the clergy is really Too coarse and too mealy."
todd,"Yes, and always arrives overdone.  I'll come again when you Have Judge on the menu..."
todd,What's that?
todd,"Have charity towards the world, my pet--"
todd,"We'll take the customers that we can get. MRS. LOVETT High-born and low, my love."
todd,"We'll not discriminate great from small. No, we'll serve anyone--"
both,And to anyone At all!
judge,So it's true.
johanna,Sir ... A gentlemen knocks before entering a lady's room.
judge,Indeed he does ... But I see no lady.
judge,I told myself the sailor was lying ... I told myself this was a cruel fiction ... That my Johanna would never betray me. Never hurt me so.
johanna,Sir ... I will leave this place.
judge,"I think that only appropriate. Since you no longer find my company to your liking, madam, we shall provide you with new lodgings."
judge,Until this moment I have spared the rod ... And the ungrateful child has broken my heart. Now you will learn discipline...
judge,"When you have learned to appreciate what you have, perhaps we shall meet again. Until then ... Think on your sins."
anthony,JOHANNA!
anthony,Where are you taking her?! Tell me or I swear by God--!
toby,"Ladies and gentlemen, May I have your attention, perlease? Are your nostrils aquiver and tingling as well At that delicate, luscious ambrosial smell? Yes they are, I can tell..."
toby,"Well, ladies and gentlemen, That aroma enriching the breeze Is like nothing compared to its succulent source, As the gourmets among you will tell you, of course."
toby,"Ladies and gentlemen, You can't imagine the rapture in store--  Just inside of this door! There you'll sample Mrs. Lovett's meat pies, Savory and sweet pies, As you'll see. You who eat pies, Mrs. Lovett's meat pies Conjure up the treat pies Used to be!"

todd,You've found Johanna?
anthony,For all the good it'll do -- it's impossible to get to her.
todd,A madhouse ... A madhouse ... Where?
anthony,Fogg's Asylum. But I've circled the place a dozen times. There's no way in. It's a fortress.
todd, I've got him.
anthony,Mr. Todd?
todd, We've got her ... Where do you suppose all the wigmakers of London go to obtain their human hair? Bedlam. They get their hair from the lunatics at Bedlam--
anthony,I don't understand--
todd,We shall set you up as a wigmaker in search of hair -- that will gain you access -- then you will take her.
anthony,Yes...
todd,You will not be deterred -- You will slaughter the world -- To bring her here.

toby,"Oh, yes, sir. Not that I ever--"
todd, Take this there and seek out a Judge Turpin. Repeat that. Repeat that.
toby,Go to the Old Bailey. Find Judge Turpin.
todd, Put this into his hands. Only to him. Do you understand?
toby,"Yes, sir, and while I'm out do you mind if I stop by the grocer and pick up the--"
todd,"DON'T CHATTER, BOY! You are not to stop! You are not to speak! You are to deliver this letter! DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!"
toby,Mr. Todd sent me on an errand ... And on the way back I went by the workhouse. And I was thinkin' ... But for you I would be there now. Or someplace worse.
toby,Seems like the Good Lord sent you for me.
toby,"Hear me out, mum ... You know there's nothing I wouldn't do for you. Say, if there was someone around -- someone bad -- only you didn't know it--"
toby,"Demons are prowling Everywhere Nowadays. I'll send 'em howling,"
toby,"No one's gonna hurt you, No one's gonna dare. Others can desert you-- Not to worry-- Whistle, I'll be there. Demons'll charm you With a smile For a while, But in time Nothing can harm you, Not while I'm around."
toby,Little things wot I been thinking ... About Mr. Todd...
toby,"Being close and being clever Ain't like being true, I don't need to, I won't never Hide a thing from you, Like some."
toby,That's Signor Pirelli's purse!
toby,"See that proves it -- what I been thinkin'--  We gotta go, ma'am, right now -- we gotta find the Beadle and get the law here--"
toby," Yes, ma'am."
toby,My heart bleeds for you havin' to go up and down all these stairs!
toby,"Yes, ma'am!"
toby,"Coo, quite a stink, ain't there?"
toby,So -- where do I start?!
toby," Yes'm, always closed properly."
toby," Good grind, comes out there."
toby,Yes'm.
toby,Do you think I might have a pie while I wait?
fogg,"... Oh yes, sir, I agree it would be to our mutual interest to come to some arrangement in regard to my poor children's hair."

todd,"The Judge will be here soon! I have no time, woman! Come on--!"
beadle,"Not my intention, good madam, though I am here on official business.  ... at your bakehouse."
todd, Of course ... But first why don't you come upstairs and let me attend to you?
beadle,"Much as I do appreciate tonsorial adornment, I really ought see to my ""official"" obligations first."
todd,"An admirable sentiment -- But I must ask you, out of professional curiosity you understand, is that a cream or a tallow pomade?"
beadle," Oh, not a pomade at all! Me secret is a touch of ambergris."
todd,"But, sir, hair that delicate requires a genuine pomade! Come along, let me show you the difference."
beadle, Well ... you are the expert in these matters...
todd,And we'll finish you off with a nice facial rub of bay rum.
beadle,"Oooh, bay rum is bracing."
todd,"And all on the house, for my friend, Beadle Bamford."
beadle,"Well, sir, I take that very kindly ... Lead on."
todd, -- disposal.

johanna, Safe ... So we run away and then all our dreams come true?
anthony,I hope so...
johanna,I have never had dreams. Only nightmares.

gentleman,"Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd, His skin was pale and his eye was odd."
banker,He shaved the faces of gentlemen Who never thereafter were heard of again.
ghosts," He trod a path that few have trod, Did Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street."
beggar woman,"He kept a shop in London town, Of fancy clients and good renown."
ghosts," His needs are few, his room is bare. He hardly uses his fancy chair. The more he bleeds, the more he lives. He never forgets and he never forgives. Perhaps today you gave a nod To Sweeney Todd. The Demon Barber of Fleet Street."
ghosts," Sweeney wishes the world away, Sweeney's weeping for yesterday, Hugging the blade, waiting the years, Hearing the music that nobody hears. Sweeney waits in the parlor hall, Sweeney leans on the office wall. No one can help, nothing can hide you-- Isn't that Sweeney there beside you? Sweeney wishes the world away, Sweeney's weeping for yesterday, Is Sweeney! There he is, it's Sweeney! Sweeney! Sweeney!"
ghosts,Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd! He served a dark and a hungry god!
todd, To seek revenge may lead to hell.
ghosts,As Sweeney Todd... The Demon Barber of Fleet...
ghosts,... Street!
