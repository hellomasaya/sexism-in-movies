His cellmate, EARL, a giant of a man, comes out of their cell carrying his bedroll and a box containing his other meager possessions. VITTI  I'm sorry. I just grabbed stuff -- I didn't know -- VITTI That's okay.     Keep it.   Go ahead. EARL Thanks.     See you around. Earl exits with the guard.

ben," One, of    course, is the public Isaac Sobel,    the eminent psychotherapist and popular    author known to millions of readers    around the world. Laura, Michael and Ben's Mother listen proudly to the eulogy. BEN The second Isaac Sobel is the private man -- my father -- Dad.

7.,"But Vitti can't stop. He drops his tray of slop, splattering food on the men. Coyote leaps to his feet and pulls a shiv. COYOTE You're a dead man, jefe! Coyote lunges at Vitti with the knife, but Vitti suddenly whirls around, bashes Coyote in the face with his food tray and bursts into song. VITTI  'I like to be in America, Okay by me in America...' The guards drag him down and cuff his hands behind him, then carry him out stiff as a board. VITTI 'Tonight, tonight, won't be just any night -- ' DISSOLVE TO: EXT.

cut to:,EXT. SOBEL HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER
ben,"Okay, I might have strayed from my notes a little. I'm dealing with a lot of stuff here. Grief is a process. Laura notices FBI AGENTS CERRONE and MILLER waiting for them in the living room. Cerrone is an attractive woman in her late twenties, wearing a dangerously-short skirt. Miller is a clean-cut man in his thirties. MILLER Dr. Sobel, I'm Agent Miller, this is Special Agent Cerrone, Federal Bureau of Investigation. We'd just like to ask you a few questions, if we could. LAURA  Can I ask what this is about?    We just came from the cemetery. CERRONE We know this is a difficult time for you, Dr. Sobel. Sorry about your father. BEN Thank you, I'm going to miss him"
9.,terribly. Ben gestures for them to sit.
laura,You told her --  You told her at the drop of a hat. Agents Cerrone and Miller eye each other. BEN She's with the F.B.I.   She needs to know these things.
laura,"Oh, I see. And I don't. Why tell Laura? She couldn't possibly handle a phone call. BEN Did I say that? MILLER You folks need a minute? BEN No, we're fine."
laura,"If you don't need me anymore, I'll be in the kitchen.  Vitti? BEN Oh, yes. Paul Vitti and I were involved in some organized crime activity a couple of years ago. I mean, I wasn't involved -- not 'involved' involved -- I was just trying to help him therapeutically, and some people tried to, uh, kill us. No big deal. MILLER Well, shortly after you spoke, he"
11.,seemed to have some kind of breakdown. BEN What kind of breakdown?

12.,"there? What mirror? Where?       Who can that attractive girl be?' BEN Paul, it's me.    Ben Sobel.   Paul?  Really. Can we take him to an examining room? DR. CUTLER Of course. CUT TO: INT. EXAMINING ROOM - MINUTES LATER Vitti sits inert on the examination table. BEN You already did a neurological work- up? DR. CUTLER Yep. No tumors, no aneurisms, no sign of stroke --"
ben,"Okay -- He sticks the needle into Vitti's shoulder. VITTI  'Boy, boy, crazy boy, keep cool, boy! Got a rocket in your pocket, keep cool-y cool boy -- ' CUT TO: INT. SING SING - CONSULTATION ROOM - NEXT DAY Vitti is sitting at a table facing Ben.     Dr. Cutler observes from a chair in the corner. BEN Paul, we're going to    give you some tests to assess your    mental condition. There's no pressure    -- just answer as best you can. Do I     have your consent to share the results    of these tests? VITTI Mommy's mad at me because I made a boom on the rug."
14.,"BEN I'll take that as a yes. Okay, I'm going to show you ten cards, each containing a picture of an inkblot. I want you to look at each card and tell me what you see. VITTI I see you.   I see him.   I see a table. BEN Focus, Paul. You haven't seen the card yet.  What does this look like to you? Take your time. Vitti looks at the wrong side of the card.    It's all white. VITTI It looks like snow. BEN No, Paul, the other side. Vitti turns it over and makes a face."

ben,"Okay, Paul. Last test. In this one, I'm going to start a sentence and you complete it any way you want to. Ready? 'I get angry -- ' VITTI Yes. BEN No, you're supposed to complete the sentence. VITTI I did.   I said 'yes.'"
ben,"I wasn't asking if you agreed or disagreed; it was more like, 'I get angry when -- ' VITTI -- whenever. BEN Well, that about does it for me. CUT TO: INT. U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY Ben meets with RICHARD CHAPIN, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. BEN Based on his symptoms and the test results, I'd say brief psychotic disorder -- if it persists, possibly schizophreniform disorder. And Dr. Cutler agrees with my diagnosis. CHAPIN So he's crazy?"
17.,"BEN Dr. Cutler?   No, he's annoying, but -- CHAPIN Vitti. BEN Not crazy. At least not permanently. In certain people, continuous exposure to an extremely stressful situation -- soldiers in combat, for instance, disaster victims, a hostage situation, or being locked up in a maximum security prison with someone trying to kill you -- it can produce a temporary psychotic state. CHAPIN How temporary? BEN A day, a week, up to a month -- if the precipitating stressors are removed. CHAPIN  Well, couldn't you release him to    a halfway house or some place where    he could get some decent treatment? Based on my earlier work with him,    I don't think he's dangerous, and I think he was making a real effort    to reform himself."
18.,"CHAPIN You do, huh?  Okay. Then I'll tell you what. I'm gonna release him into your custody. BEN Mine? Me? No, this is a bad time for me. My father just died -- and I've got this bulging disc in my neck -- and we're redecorating, which is a total nightmare. I can't -- CHAPIN You want to see him killed in prison? BEN No, of course not. CHAPIN Or sent to a facility for the criminally insane. BEN No --"
chapin,Then he's all yours. I'm going to talk to the Bureau of Prisons and get you certified as a temporary federal institution. BEN  Yes.    We're clear.
19.,CHAPIN You still want him? BEN  Yes. CUT TO: EXT. SING SING - FEW DAYS LATER
20.,BEN What are you talking about? VITTI I call you to say somebody's trying to kill me and you hang up on me? BEN I was at the funeral home! VITTI You're my fuckin' doctor!
ben,"My father died! VITTI Me me me me!   He's dead!   Get over it. BEN Are you hearing yourself? VITTI  What's that? BEN Decongestant. I'm getting over a cold. All right, what's going on? Who's after you? VITTI I don't know -- take your pick. Could be my old family, or could be the Rigazzis. Ever heard of Lou Rigazzi - - Lou 'The Wrench'?"
21.,"BEN Why ""The Wrench""? VITTI Because he twisted a guy's head off once. BEN Off? VITTI Off. Fuckin' Calabrese -- animals. And comin' from me you know that's a big compliment. BEN I'm sure they'd be flattered.    So -- VITTI The feds are really putting the pressure on. The families are fighting each other again -- what's left of 'em. It's the fall of the fuckin' Roman Empire. It's World War Three out there. BEN So what does that have to do with you? VITTI They knew I was gettin' out soon and the last thing anybody wants to see is me getting into it on either side. BEN Maybe if you just explain to them -- that you're out of it now, that you're starting a new life -- VITTI Yeah,   they'll probably want to throw me a   party and give me a gold watch. Trust   me -- nobody's lookin' forward to me   being out. BEN You are, aren't you? VITTI Me? Oh, yeah, my future looks real fuckin' rosy. Ben can't believe what he's gotten himself into. CUT TO: EXT. SOBEL HOUSE - LATER"
vitti,"What are you, my father now? BEN And you    have to get a job as soon as you're    well enough, which is now. So are you    coming in with me or do I have to make    a phone call? Vitti relents and grabs his stuff from the back seat. VITTI I'm comin'.    Some fuckin' life this is gonna be. He follows Ben up the stairs. CUT TO: INT. U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - LATER Chapin is conferring with another U.S. ATTORNEY, DAVIS, and Agents Miller and Cerrone. CERRONE You really think Vitti is crazy? CHAPIN Yeah, he's about as crazy as I am."
23.,"Think about it. Locked up, he was absolutely no use to me. But back on the street, Vitti's still powerful enough to pose a threat to both families. It's like throwing gasoline on a fire. DAVIS If we can use Vitti to escalate this war, we might just end up putting them all away."
miller,"That's if he goes back to his old life. CHAPIN If? People like Paul Vitti     don't change. This guy's been a     menace to society since he was twelve    years old. Being a criminal is all he    knows. Trust me. DAVIS He's gonna head straight for trouble. Then all we have to do is sit back and pick up the pieces. We could get twenty, maybe even thirty indictments next time the grand jury convenes. CHAPIN  -- mobster -- in my home -- eating off my dishes."
24., Ewww.
ben,I told you. He's in my custody.      I'm a federal institution. LAURA You should be in an institution.     Why couldn't he just go home? BEN His wife and kids aren't here. They're in Ohio. LAURA Ohio! Sure. Everyone gets to be in Ohio except me. BEN His life was threatened and he didn't want to endanger his family. LAURA How thoughtful! What about endangering our family?  Here he is! VITTI Coffee?
laura,What?
vitti,Somebody said something about coffee. LAURA That was you.    You said you wanted some. VITTI So what's the holdup? LAURA  Are you really that pussy-whipped?
ben,I'm not -- this has nothing to do with Laura.
vitti,I heard her busting your balls. BEN We were having a disagreement. A certain amount of conflict is normal in a marriage.
vitti,"Or? BEN Or what? VITTI Or you're pussy-whipped. BEN Paul -- VITTI Good night, Whippy."
ben," Mike, can we talk for a second? MICHAEL Sure.     What?"
ben,"I know the last few weeks have been kind of tough with Grandpa -- dying and everything -- and it might've felt to you like I didn't have time for you or I didn't care about how you feel. MICHAEL No, it didn't. BEN Good. Because I want you to know that you can talk to me about stuff and that I can really listen and understand what you're going through. MICHAEL I do, Dad. BEN And if I seemed a little hard on Grandpa, it's just that your grandfather was a hard man in a lot of ways. He wanted everything done his way and sometimes I just felt like nothing I ever did was good enough. I don't want it to be that way with us. MICHAEL It's not. BEN And you know, at times like this we all might start questioning our own mortality and you might be thinking how devastated you'd be if I died. Right? MICHAEL No.   Not really. BEN That's good. Good talk. And I realize it's all a little hectic right now, but this Paul Vitti thing is only temporary, okay? MICHAEL Oh, really? I didn't hear you the tenth fuckin' time. BEN That's not funny.   Good night, Michael."
michael,"Good night, Whippy."

Oh, oh, oh, oh! BEN This has to be some kind of record, don't you think? It's been like forty minutes. LAURA How long are you going to let them go on? BEN Let them? How much longer can he go? Another twenty minutes, I'm either breaking it up or calling the Guinness Book of Records. The MOANING shifts into low gear, more guttural and bestial. LAURA Oh, give me a break.    She's got to be"
29.,"faking.   Nobody sounds like that. BEN  That's not entirely true. LAURA Okay, sometimes you do sound like that. The O.S. MOANING kicks up another notch. Laura rolls over and jams her pillow over her ears. Ben growls, exasperated."
cut to:,"INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - SAME TIME Michael's girlfriend is gone. He has his bedroom door open a crack and he's standing there holding a small tape recorder and smiling broadly. WOMAN  Ah, ah, ah, ah...! CUT TO:"

vitti,"Minding my own fuckin' business, like you should be doin'. BEN Well, it's a little hard with the live sex show going on in the guest room. VITTI I've been in prison for two and a half years. What am I supposed to do? BEN Go to a hotel. VITTI That's what I wanted to do, but you told me I had no choice -- it was either here or Sing Sing. BEN I'm not trying to punish you. These aren't my rules, but I have a responsibility here. Besides, I thought you might like a nice home- cooked meal after being in prison that long."
vitti,"Yeah, that's what I've been jerkin' off about for eight hundred consecutive nights -- a nice home- cooked meal.  Ohhhh, tuna casserole. BEN That girl is not staying here."
vitti,"I think you're jealous. BEN Oh, yeah, I'm really jealous. VITTI I didn't hear nothin' comin' out of your room. BEN We don't think it's necessary to wake the neighbors every time we have sex."
vitti,"Hey, if you're really quiet, you might be able to do it without even wakin' up your wife. SHEILA  Ohhh.   Ohhh. Ben looks curiously at Vitti. VITTI I told her if I wasn't back in two minutes to start without me. I gotta go. Vitti heads back upstairs. BEN This is not a good start, Paul. CUT TO: INT. DINING AREA - NEXT MORNING Laura and Ben are hosting a brunch for the out-of-town relatives. Laura offers a basket of bagels to a seated, older woman."
laura,"Aunt Ester, I'm so sorry we had to put you up at the hotel. We wanted you here with us, but we had an unexpected house guest. She glares at Ben. AUNT ESTHER  Your father always had room for us."
ben,"I'm sorry.  Go to hell, Paul! You just go to hell!"
33.,"Vitti bellies up to the buffet, stepping between an older couple. He eyes the food disdainfully. VITTI Oh, great. Jew food. Who do you have to fuck to get some bacon around here? The woman reacts in horror. VITTI Not you, I'm guessing."

ben,"I know. All you did was flash everybody in the dining room. VITTI So? From the look of 'em, some of those broads haven't seen the old salcicc' in a long time. It's good for them. BEN Well, when the paramedics revive my Aunt Goldie, I'll be sure to ask her. Sit. Vitti starts for Ben's chair. BEN Ah ah ah! He points Vitti to the sofa and takes his own chair. BEN So what are you going to do, Paul? VITTI What do you mean? BEN With your life."
vitti,"First I'm gonna find out who's tryin' to kill me. I'm a target. Somebody could shoot right through that window -- blow my fuckin' head off. Ben sees that he's in the line of fire, gets up and moves out of the way."
ben,"Okay, that's a priority. Have you thought about what you're going to do for work? VITTI Yeah. I'm too big for a jockey so I was thinkin' maybe a hairdresser. They'll call me Mr. Paul. BEN Come on. There must be something you like to do. VITTI I like hitting a guy on the head with a baseball bat. BEN Oh, sporting goods. We'll check the want ads tomorrow but don't get your hopes up. Anything else? VITTI Shylocking, bookmaking, unions, the usual -- BEN Who are you? VITTI Who am I? I'm the guy who's paying you $150 an hour to play these stupid fuckin' games. You know who I am. BEN I know that.   I mean what are you? VITTI What do you mean, 'What am I?' BEN I just want to know how you see yourself."

So what are you the boss of? VITTI You, you're good. I see what you're doing here. BEN What am I doing, Paul? VITTI You're pissing me off is what you're doing. Look at me. It's starting again, the anxiety."
ben,"I understand. BEN  You've    spent your whole life becoming who you    are and now you can't be that anymore    -- that's gotta be scary. If you're    not Paul Vitti the mob boss, who are    you? Vitti is at a loss. BEN Well, let's think. When you were a kid, What did you want to be? VITTI I don't know.    Who remembers that stuff? BEN You must've wanted to be something when you were little -- fireman? VITTI No. BEN Baseball player?"
vitti,No.
ben,Astronaut? VITTI No. BEN Al Capone?
vitti,"Yeah, maybe.    What did you want to be? BEN We're not talking about me. VITTI I am. BEN Fine.   I wanted to be a philatelist. VITTI You wanted to look up people's assholes all day? BEN No, Paul, I believe you're thinking of a proctologist. I wanted to collect rare and unusual stamps. VITTI You must've been a lot of laughs when you were a kid. Lonely, huh? BEN Oh yeah. Big time.      So what did you want to be? VITTI It's stupid. BEN You afraid to tell me? VITTI Yeah, I'm afraid. BEN Then tell me.    I'm not here to judge you."

Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, the Lone Ranger -- BEN Interesting.   They're all good guys. VITTI Yeah, I guess. BEN No, that's important. You didn't want to be the bad guy. You wanted to be the hero."

ben,So what happened? VITTI I don't know.    Nothing happened. BEN So why didn't you become a cowboy?
vitti,"I lived in East Harlem! I joined a street gang when I was 12 and that was it. BEN Something else happened when you were twelve. VITTI What? BEN  Something that made you very sad? VITTI The Dodgers moved from Brooklyn to L.A. Everybody took it pretty hard. BEN Something else. VITTI We playin' a guessing game here? BEN Paul! Your father was murdered! Right in front of you. Remember? VITTI Do I remember? I think about it every fuckin' day of my life. What's that got to do with it? BEN It's got everything   to do with it. He gave you the cowboy   suit. With a white hat. He was    in the mob, but he wanted you to be a   good guy, didn't he? Vitti starts thinking about his father and starts to weep."
39.,"VITTI Yeah.   He did. BEN He didn't want you in the gang life. He only did it himself so you wouldn't have to. He was trying to buy you a better life than his. VITTI  Yeah, just sprinkle some fuckin' fairy dust on me. BEN I'm just saying you've got to keep an open mind and explore some new possibilities. Try some different things -- maybe you'll connect with one of them. There's a career counselor I work with. I can call him for you. He may be able to help you find a job. VITTI You mean working for somebody? I'm supposed to take orders from some guy who used to get me coffee? (starts sweating and"
