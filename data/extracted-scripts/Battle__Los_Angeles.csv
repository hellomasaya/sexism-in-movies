Speaker,Dialogue
five marines,"From the 1st Platoon, 2nd battalion, 5th Marines .. Camo uniforms, NIGHT VISION GOGGLES on, stare into the DARK. CPL. CORREGGIO, 20, linebacker-big, shakes his head, frustrated."
anna,Call me later.
cherise,"For three hundred more, she said we could have sprays of lilies. I know it's a lot, but it'd be so beautiful. What d'you think, baby? Harris looks pained. But before he can speak up:"
psychiatrist,Still not sleeping... And the nightmares?
psychiatrist,"You're not drinking, right, private? That's just a crutch..."
captain,These objects were completely undetected until they entered our atmosphere.
captain,"We have no idea. But whatever they are, they're not hitting the water at terminal velocity. They're able to slow down before impact. Glances exchanged in the room now."
captain,"This is no meteor shower. Homeland Security has bumped the threat level to red. Marines, we are the first line of defense. All units gear up, be ready to move."
the marines,"Push forward, scrambling to the TVs."
televisions,"The REPORTER ON THE BEACH staring out, clearly panicked."
televisions,As the REPORTER reacts to isolated SHOUTS echoing from the crowd on the beach. Some are pointing out to the ocean...
captain,"Situation is as follows: Most of Santa Monica is cleared of civilians. We've got a defensive line at Lincoln Boulevard a mile from the ocean... He points out LINCOLN BOULEVARD on a MAP, the OCEAN close by."
captain,"At 9 p.m., everything from Lincoln to the ocean will be bombed. Martinez blanches."
captain,"We've got an infestation of god- knows-what. It's an enemy ground force only, they have no aircraft. So our jets'll tear 'em a new asshole. We will rule the air."
captain,"That's affirm. We're getting distress calls, sending squads out. He points to the MAP, to streets running from Lincoln Blvd."
captain,"Your mission, Lieutenant, take your 1st squad, proceed west from Lincoln to a community center located here...  In a park on 10th and Bay Street. Police were using it as an evacuation point. They got overrun. Get there, any civilians you find, get 'em back here to the FOB for evacuation. You got three hours. Another CHOPPER is LANDING. Nantz yells over the sound:"
captain,"Not much. But police have shot 'em. They bleed. The captain, hurrying to the next chopper, yells back:"
captain,It's our job to kill 'em.
adukwu,"Shit, I'd rather be in Afghanistan."
marine,"2nd squad, 3rd platoon..."
marine,"This is it, Lieutenant. Everyone else is dead or missing. The news hits Martinez hard. He eyes Nantz."
marine,"We were on the street, like, ten minutes and they ambushed us. As soon as we radioed for help, it's like they were everywhere..."
michele,There's five of us. Three kids. Nantz is immediately moving.
crewman,You called in with two wounded!
crewman,Can't take four! We have no room!
crew chief,"Now! We're moving now! Imlay bumps fists with Lenihan, backs away as..."
adukwu,All those guys on the chopper...
amy,"You're not gonna leave us, are you? A beat. Then Imlay smiles."
rincon,"My son and I came here... There were only three cops, spread pretty thin... Then those things attacked. Police couldn't stop them."
rincon,"I don't know. Most people ran. We hid in a side room, found Michele and the girls... Couldn't see what happened. Just heard... Screams."
michele,I have my nieces for the week. My sister and her husband are in Hawaii for their anniversary... Is it safe there? I heard this is happening in other places... Martinez is at a loss for words.
michele,What do they want from us? Why are they here?
hector,"Want some Nerds? Imlay holds his hand out. Hector shakes candy into it as... Nantz enters, calling to Adukwu:"
michele,"Maybe I can help, sergeant. I'm a vet..."
michele," No, a veterinarian."
michele,Michele.
michele,I was more sure two minutes ago. She looks to Adukwu. They step to the body together as... Nantz approaches Martinez.
adukwu,"Well, Lieutenant, I'm a medic, Dr. McDermott's a vet... We weren't sure who was most qualified to cut this thing open. Martinez smiles."
adukwu,"Look. It's been surgically modified... He pulls tissue aside, revealing where the alien's 'gun' is attached to its arm."
adukwu,Part of its arm has been amputated to fit this weapon.
kirsten,"My... pony holder? Nantz nods. She pulls the PONY TAIL HOLDER from her hair, hands it to Nantz. He smiles. Briefly. Heads to the front."
michele,"Your head, Sergeant. You're bleeding. Nantz touches his head, looks at the blood. He wipes it on his pants. Michele smiles at him softly."
michele,"Bet when you woke up this morning, you didn't think your day would end up like this."
hector, Are we gonna die? Nantz turns back to Hector. Manages a smile.
adukwu,"Okay, it's clear. We're gonna go. Amy and Kirsten, terrified, look up at Michele. She hurries the girls to the door of the bus as Kern runs up."
michele,It's okay. I'll be right behind you. Adukwu picks up Amy. Kerns picks up Kirsten.
rincon,"It's okay, son. I got you."
rincon,"What do I need to know? The slightest beat, then..."
rincon,Just sight down the barrel...?
rincon,"Listen to me, son. I'm not going to make it.  But you will."
hector,I don't want to go without you.
rincon,"I know. But you have to. Now wait with Michele a minute. Let me talk to the sergeant. Reluctantly, Hector allows Michele to lead him away."
rincon,"No. You can't take me. Nantz is silent, at a loss."
rincon,I keep playing it over in my head... If I'd done things differently... Maybe I could have gotten Hector out earlier.
rincon,"Just promise you'll get my son out of here, Sergeant. Nantz looks like he has the weight of the world on him."
rincon,"I'm trusting you with the only thing I have in this world. Nantz stares, nods."
rincon,"I'm very proud of you, son. You're being so brave... Hector throws his arms around his father, hugging him tightly."
rincon,"I love you, Hector. Mr. Rincon smiles. His face peaceful. Hector is silent, tears rolling down his face."
michele,"What's happening, Sergeant? What's that mean?"
hector,I don't wanna be here. I want my dad back. I want it all to go back to the way it was before...
nantz,Tries to lead Hector away. Hector struggles.
michele,What's the matter?
hector,"People always say that. ""He's a hero."""
hector,"What's that mean, ""retreat hell?"""
michele,"You don't look much older, either. She gazes at the kids, pain and anger washing over her."
michele,Is this day ever going to end?
adukwu,Emmanuel. Manny.
michele,"I'm single. Lots of family back in Nebraska, though... Hopefully they're safe... She shakes the thought away."
michele,What about you guys?
adukwu,Nigeria. I came here to be a doctor.
michele,"You should be a surgeon, the way you cut into that thing... Adukwu smiles. Then his smile fades as he looks around."
adukwu,Yeah. Maybe...
sgt nantz,Get us there. Cause we're about to get lit up. The alien drone ships are winging at them. They are only 200 meters out when...
crew chief,"You are in the middle of the shit, Sergeant! Everything's been pulled back."
crew chief,"We've lost most of our air assets. We're abandoning Los Angeles. This city's done...!  Let's go! The chopper powers up, Nantz SCRAMBLES ON with the others."
crew chief,"Something there was playing hell with our power! Nantz stares at this. Then notices Hector watching. him. He sees the 2/5 MEDALLION clutched tightly in Hector's hand. Sees the words ""Retreat Hell."" Nantz looks back at the MYSTERIOUS BLACK PATCH of cityscape. Then he turns to the crew chief."
crew chief,"What?! The other marines in Nantz' unit look over, alarmed now."
crew chief,We can't land! May not have power to take off again... Nantz looks out. Spies a BUILDING with a FLAT OPEN ROOF. He points to it.
hector,What are you gonna do?
marines,"Yes, Sergeant!"
nantz,I think you men earned the right to call yourselves marines today. I'm damn proud of every one of you. Retreat!?
