Speaker,Dialogue
doorman,"Morning, folks. Can I help you?"
kresimir,"Yes, please. I... er, we... are looking for the rental agent here. We have an appointment."
doorman,"OK, I'll just give him a little buzz and he'll come out and show you the way in."
doorman, Darned thing.
benda,Do you ever use that?
doorman,"This? No, never even had it out of the holster. A rival company has 'em, so we gotta have 'em. Just an advertising gimmick."
doorman,Here's Mr. Merrick. He'll take you on in.
merrick, Welcome to Starliner Towers. And you are...?
kresimir,Kresimir and Benda Sviben.
merrick,"Eh? Oh yes, of course. Mr. and Mrs. Sweden. Come right this way. Sorry to keep you waiting. Now, are we talking about one or two bedrooms? I assume we're not talking about bachelors, eh? Ha, ha. Now, I have several floor plans all laid out for you, and all you have to do is take your choice and we'll trot right on up there and take a look at 'em..."
merrick,"Now you take a look at that one, Brenda, and tell me if it doesn't suit you down to the ground. That one has the big view, the panoramic view..."
janine,Can I call you at the office?
tudor,What do you want to call me at the office for?
janine,I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
tudor,I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I'll come home right after work.
merrick,We're going up.
tudor,"Oh. Well, I'll go along for the ride."
merrick," Wood-grain paneling, strong, silent, fireproof, fast, cushioned ride. Everything you could want in an elevator."
detective, And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
super,"Far as I know, yeah, that was her."
detective,Is that the man who called you up here?
super,"Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here."
detective,Medical clinic?
super,"Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains."
detective,"Well, let's go talk to your doctor."
detective,Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
detective,You're the one who found the bodies?
detective,Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
detective,You knew these people?
detective,So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
detective,I see. Then what brought you up here?
detective,How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
super, It's for you. Somebody wants to know how come you didn't show up for lunch.
rollo,"Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want."
rollo,"I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?"
rollo,So who changes?
rollo,"That was my father's idea... private practice. He wanted to set me up -- I couldn't say no. But he's dead now. And me, I'm still a snoop, I gotta do research. Look at that beautiful stuff...  ...lookit it!"
rollo, This is the 'Satyr's Tongue'!
rollo,"The note includes a warning against swallowing the tongue whole, but we don't see the rest of this caution. 'Satyr's Tongue' was Hobbes's code name for our project. What we were trying to do was to find an alternative to organ transplants."
rollo,"I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?"
rollo," Look. You got men, you got parasites that live in, on, and around men. Now. Why not breed a parasite that does something useful? Eh? Why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs? Why not, for example, a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney? If it takes a little blood for itself, so what? Be generous! You can afford it."
rollo,"You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy."
rollo,Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?
rollo,"You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. Could he get grants for crazy projects?"
rollo,You know who pays the rent here? Eh? The Northern Hemisphere Organ Transplant Society. And that's for something that's supposed to put them outta business. And they're not the only ones. We got grant money coming out of our ears.
rollo,"See? There? You take a little of this... that's a very rare venereal disease you get in the nomadic Crinua people, Northeast Asia and Japan.  Ya like 'em big 'n hot 'n wet, don't ya? Yeah."
rollo,"We don't do it all here, we send out to have tricky stuff done... the cell fusion, enucleation, chromosomal fission, all that fancy close work."
rollo," Funny in the head. High suicide rate in the medical profession. Too much body, alla time bodies, bodies."
rollo,"Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation."
rollo, You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
rollo,"It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects."
rollo, Don't ask.
rollo,I'll never really understand how he could do what he did to her.
rollo,"Yeah, sure."
rollo,"But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?"
janine,You say something?
tudor,Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
janine," You sure you're OK, Nick?"
betts,"...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?"
janine,He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
betts,"Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out."
janine, He'll be really mad.
betts, So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change.
betts," Oops, sorry. Hi. Haven't seen you here before, have I?"
tudor," No, no. I'll be all right. I'm all right."
tudor," Call me a cab, will you please, Mona? I'm going home for the day."
tudor,I don't care what you think. Please call me a cab. Now.
parkins,"...and this Kriedler seems to think that mega-vitamin therapy may be the answer to the question of aging. That's not to suggest that the aging process is in any way reversible -- I don't think for a minute that it is -- but it may be stoppable, and that's where mega-vitamins come in..."
janine,"Excuse me, Brad. Gotta go."
doorman,"Afternoon, Mr. Tudor."
janine, You'll come up and take a look at him?
janine,"That's great, Doctor. Thanks."
forsythe,"Mrs. Ementhal's ready and waiting, Doctor."
forsythe,"I'm ready for you now, Brad."
forsythe,"Now, you just take off all your clothes, put this on, and hop up on to the table over there, OK? Doctor'll be in to see you in a few minutes."
parkins, You don't have to go. I'm not shy.
forsythe,"Don't be a tease, Brad. I'm still working, you know."
first lady," Aw. Poor birdie. They're always crashing into tall buildings. It's such a shame, such a shame. The windows fool them, you know."
companion,"Come along, Olive."
first lady,"Oh, Vi! Maybe the poor thing's just been hurt. Maybe we should look for him!"
companion," Don't be silly, dear. It's in heaven now, whatever it is. Won't help at all for you to get into a fuss and muddle over it. Now come along and let's finish up our little evening stroll and get you tucked up in bed in front of the color TV."
companion,"You know what a restless night you have if you don't get your two hours of color TV, dear, so let's bustle along and get our walk over with, shall we...?"
parkins,Ow! Better take it easy. There's a lot of pressure in there!
parkins,Want me to breathe deeply?
parkins," Good shape for an old man, eh?"
parkins,"She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself."
parkins, Didn't seem worried about them.
parkins,"Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  Must have gone home to mother."
parkins,That's the one.
parkins,Gonna cut me open?
parkins,"Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that."
janine,Hi.
betts,Hi. Want a drink?
janine,No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
betts,Was he nice to you?
betts,"Good. Well...  I've ordered in some vrai cuisine franaise from Jean-Phillipe at the Cte d'Azur restaurant. Escargots in garlic butter... the works. They have lovely strong delivery boys who fight their way through sleet and hail and the gloom of night just to bring me my coq au vin. And after Dr. St. Luc has told you that there's nothing wrong with Nick that a vacation won't cure, and if Nick falls asleep early again, you just come on back here for company and a late supper. You hear me?"
betts,"Now, I mean it. I always order enough for two and I'll just get fat and lonely if you don't show up."
girl,"C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it."
boy,"I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead."
girl,"OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself."
boy,"Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?"
girl, With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
boy,I dunno. Guess the milk went bad.  It's still worth money.
girl,Jesus!
boy,Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
tudor," Come here, boy. Here, boy, here."
tudor,"Come on, fella. Thataboy. You and me, we're gonna be friends, aren't we?"
tudor,"No, no, no. Don't run away, boy. I'm not going to hurt you. Not going to hurt you. We're going to be friends. Friends."
tudor, Attaboy.
janine,Nick? I didn't know you were home. What's wrong? What are you doing? You're almost falling out of bed. How are you feeling?
janine," Nick, does your stomach hurt? Can I see those bumps on your tummy, can I?"
tudor,Go away. Leave me alone.
janine," Oh, why won't you let me help you?"
tudor," Attaboy, attaboy."
forsythe," OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you."
forsythe,Do I get a kiss?
forsythe,"Kiss, kiss?"
forsythe,Another kiss?
forsythe,No. Dotty's the last.
rollo," Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them."
rollo," Anyway, I've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: Hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. We never really knew what it was we were working on. Hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like."
rollo,It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
rollo,Lemme clarify for you.
rollo,"Hobbes thought that man is an animal that thinks too much, an animal that has lost touch with his instinct, his 'primal self'... in other words, too much brain and not enough guts. And what he came up with to help our guts along was a human parasite that is... lemme find it here... 'a combination of aphrodisiac and venereal disease, a modern version of the satyr's tongue.'"
rollo,"But the important thing for you is this: Hobbes used Annabelle as a guinea pig. He implanted her with the thing. I figure that once the parasites took, Annabelle went berserk. I dunno what she did, but Hobbes wasn't ready for it. He had to kill her. And he wasn't trying to burn her, he was burning them, all of them."
rollo,I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
rollo,"Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things..."
rollo,"I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them."
forsythe,"Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?"
forsythe, Doesn't matter to me how late it is. I can keep it warm.
forsythe,Anything wrong?
forsythe,Well? Supper at my place?
forsythe, Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
old woman,I'm hungry!
old woman,I'm hungry!
old woman,Hungry for love. Hungry for love.
forsythe,Yes?
forsythe,Can I... can I help you?
kresimir, Yes... you can... help me.
kresimir,"Oh, my darling, I worship, I worship at the shrine of your body, your body, your body, oh, your body..."
forsythe,"A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me..."
forsythe,I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
forsythe,"Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you."
doorman,"Here, here. What is this all about? What's the matter with you? What are you doing in there?"
doorman,"Hey, that's enough, enough of this nonsense! What is this? "
forsythe,But where are you going?
tudor,"Janine. Janine. Come here. Come into the bedroom, Janine."
janine,"Nick? Are you up? I can't see a thing, I took my contacts out."
tudor,"Hello, darling. I feel wonderful. Come and sit beside me, beside me on the bed."
tudor,"Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?"
janine," Nick, you're so strange..."
tudor,"You will make love to me, won't you, Janine? Won't you make love to me? You start it. Won't you? I think I've forgotten how to start."
janine," Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this."
tudor,"Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine..."
tudor,"Love me. Oh, Janine, you're so beautiful. You're my wife. Mmm. You're my wife."
tudor," You're my wife, Janine. Please make love to me."
janine," No, no. Nick, please. Stop. Let's stop. I... I want to put my contacts in... I can't see anything..."
tudor," Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me..."
janine," I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?"
tudor, Ooooooooooooooooo!
tudor," Janine, Janine, Janinnnnnneeee!"
janine," I'm here, Nick. Janine is here."
janine,Betts? Betts? It's me.
forsythe, Hello? Hello?
janine," Oh, Betts, Betts, everything is so hideous. Everything dies and rots and disappears. I'm going to die, and you're going to die, and Nick..."
betts,"There, there, there. It all gets sorted out in the genes and chromosomes. It's not for us to think about at all. It's not our problem at all, 'Nine. We're just here to exist and to have a good time. Exist and have a good time.  Do I feel good, 'Nine? Do I feel good to you?"
janine,"Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny."
betts," Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me."
janine,Betts! You can't really be saying that! You just can't!
betts,"Let's not talk any more, 'Nine, shall we? Let's kiss and make up. Let's kiss... kiss and make up, shall we? 'Nine?"
forsythe,"Roger? Roger, are you here?"
merrick,"...haven't seen anything that looks like trouble at all. Just filling in for Walter... the doorman. But if you want me to call the police, I will."
man,Apartment 307? Visiting my sister.
merrick,"Evening, Mr. Wolf, Miss Lewis. I wonder if I could talk to you for a second in my office?"
miss lewis,"Why don't you do something about all that noise? We like parties, but this is ridiculous."
merrick,"Well, there may be a connection. See, it's about your locker. 'Fraid somebody busted into it tonight."
merrick,'Fraid so. I've got a few of the things they threw around in my office and if you could identify it...
rollo,"Hello, good evening, is anybody here? Dr. St. Luc? It's Dr. Linsky here to see you for consultation."
rollo,It's Dr. Linsky. Anybody home?
rollo,Is that Mr. Nicholas Tudor? It's Dr. Linsky. I'm meeting Dr. St. Luc here. He must be a little bit late.
rollo,Is anyone here? Nicholas Tudor? Is that you? Tudor? Mind if I have a look at you?
rollo,"Just a peek, OK? A little peek won't hurt."
tudor,"No, no, no, no. Mustn't, mustn't. You mustn't kill them, no, no, no."
tudor,"No, no. You mustn't kill them. That's my blood you're spilling! My blood! Let them come home, let them come home, home, home inside me. Don't kill them...!"
tudor," At least save me one! For God's sake! At least save me one. One, one, one, one..."
forsythe,"Sometimes I have a recurrent dream. Have I ever told you about it, darling? I guess you could call it a Freudian dream, because in this dream I find myself making love to Sigmund Freud. But I'm having trouble because he's old and dying, and he smells bad and I find him repulsive. And then he tells me that everything is erotic, everything is sexual, you know what I mean? He has a very thick accent, but I can understand him perfectly. He tells me that even old flesh is erotic flesh, that disease is the love of two alien kinds of creatures for each other, that dying is an act of eroticism, that even chemicals combine out of sexual frenzy and longing. That breathing is sexual, that talking is sexual, that just to physically exist is sexual... And I believe him, and we make love beautifully..."
woman, Hellooooo? Oooooo? Is there anyone here who's all alooooooooone?
betts, Give him a kiss. Give him a kiss.
various residents," A kiss, a kiss, a kiss!"
kresimir, Nobody should be alone! Nobody should be alone tonight!
residents, Nobody alone! Nobody alone!
