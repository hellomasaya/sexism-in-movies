radio woodpecker, I hate this job... There's not even a health plan...
radio woodpecker," Good morning, Bedrock. This is station B-R-O-K with the morning weather and news... 18   IN THE BED                                                    18"
fred,"Dino, that's enough -- here, look, Daddy has a nice dino bone for you, just please stop it --"
wilma,"Fred, stop playing with Dino and sit down. Your breakfast's getting cold."
fred, And what's wrong with my leftovers?
wilma,I'll let you know when I see some.
fred,"That's right, sweetheart. The only thing that's gonna eat you up is -- me!"
fred,"Arnold! Arnold! Don't aim at the house -- please, not at the house -- WHAM! Fred ducks back just as the stone newspaper slams into the window frame, SMASHING a FLOWERPOT, taking out a chunk of wall, and continuing diagonally through the kitchen and out another window. Fred follows this action in time to see -- 22   HIS DRIVEWAY - THROUGH THE OTHER WINDOW                       22 The rock paper drops like a foul shot, rips through the canvas roof of Fred's car, and then bangs a huge dent in the hood."
wilma,Lucky it wasn't the Sunday paper.
fred, Yeah.   What else can go wrong?
betty," Come on, kids. Time for nursery school."
pebbles,"'Bye-bye, Daddy."
fred,"'Bye, little sweetheart.  'Bye, big sweetheart."
barney,"Heh, hey. That Arnold's got a real arm on him, don't he?"
fred,"This is the third ragtop this year ... say, shouldn't you be at work?"
barney,"Ah, well, that appliance store and me, we kinda had a little adjustment --"
fred,"You got fired, didn't ya? "
fred,"Yeah, I know, I know, those crazy inventions of yours. Be honest with me, Barn... tell me one thing you invented that really caught on. BARNEY I invented fire."
fred," You invented fire? BARNEY I told you that, Fred. But the coal conglomerate ripped me off. The case is still in court, but meanwhile I got lotsa other ideas -- FRED Yeah, but did any one of them ever put bread on the table? How long are you and Betty gonna live on those penny-ante royalties you get?"
fred,"If you ask me, pal, you're just blowing smoke up your own volcano..."
barney,"Maybe, Fred.   But first..."
barney,-- Add some lava granules... some woca leaves... juice from two coo-coo berries...
fred," Two coo-coo berries?   You made of money, Barney?"
barney,"Anything for a pal, Fred -- a lump of coal... bamboo sawdust... eucalyptus sap... a touch of the La Brea tarbrush -- and -- voila. Barney dips a finger in this mess, ""tastes"" it; satisfied, he yanks on a hanging rope and a giant rock weight slams down on the whole mess, making Fred jump out of his skin."
betty,"You're welcome, Mrs. Granite. But we wipe their mouths every day."
wilma,"We're really going to miss you, too, Mrs. Granite."
betty,"We're still shopping around. WILMA Fortunately, we're both -- Wilma and Betty straighten... salute."
barney,"Not bad, eh? After it cures for an hour or so, it's solid as a rock."
fred,"Okay, you fixed a dented hood. But you call that a living? Face it, pal, this is the Stone Age, and it's a dino eat dino world. You want my advice?"
barney,Did I ever?
barney,"You're a big man anywhere, Fred -- FRED I'm serious, pal. Me and Mr. Slate are just like this -- He takes his hand off the wheel to hold up two fingers... ends up swerving instead."
fred,"-- just like that. I know, I know -- you're not a clock-punching guy -- but face it, Barney -- it's time to grow up and put your nose to the grindstone, batten down the hatches and join the ratasaurus race with the rest of us.  It's time to retire those dreams. Barney looks glum, doesn't say anything.    Suddenly Fred pulls over, stops the car. FRED Barney.   Look. 29   WIDE SHOT                                                   29 They're at the crest of a high wide hill."
barney,"Hey.   Lava Lane. FRED Remember the old days, Barn? We used to race our go-carts here to impress the girls."
barney," Yeah, those were the days... we usta dream about coming back here some day with a real car and goin' for the goldrock...!"
feldspar,Gravel. Get me the radar reading and I'll show you how we deal with scofflaws.

A two-story office building is at one end of the site with a big ""Slate Construction Inc."" sign on the roof. CAMERA ADJUSTS as Fred's car turns into the lot, Barney seated beside Fred. The new green hood gleams in the morning light. 44   CLOSER - FRED'S CAR                                          44 Fred digs his feet into the ground, slams to a halt. He gets out, surveys the activity. Immediately, the various workers shout AD LIB greetings. Fred acknowledges these, beaming in the respect he gets here."
fred,"Barney, you won't regret this -- hiya, Al -- fixing dents in cars is one thing, a career's another. Here, you're getting in on the ground floor of the first footstep of a new leaf -- hi, Wally, how's the old backhand? And with a guy like me ta show you the ropes, you can skip all the red tape, all the malarky, all the dino doo --"
girl," Hi, Mr. Flintstone."
fred,"Hiya, Shirley. This is my very special neighbor and pal Barney Rubble. He needs an application form, okay? GIRL Anything for you, Mr. Flintstone."
fred,"My pleasure, Shirl.    Anytime. GIRL Okay. But do you think next time we could go to the same game? FRED  No problem. Fred smiles at her, hands the forms to Barney. Fres steps towards the quarry, admires the activity, hands on hips, master of all he surveys. He waves to more friends. FRED Well, Barn, what did I tell you? When you're in with Flintstone, you're in like Flint. BARNEY Gee, Fred. I knew you were a big shot. I just didn't know how big. Fred beams at that, and then follows Barney's gaze to the read-out on the truck scale. Fred is standing on it and it's pushing 250. With a scowl, Fred grabs Barney's sleeve and they go into the quarry. As they move, the CAMERA PANS and CRANES UP TOWARDS the window of the Slate Construction Office."

fred,"Whoa, whoa, big fella -- He calms the beast by giving it a carrot.   As it munches, Fred quickly ties the reins to a post. FRED  You're on report, Piltdown! If it's up to me you'll be pushing a wheelbarrow!"

lava, Sounds like a worker's comp claim if I ever heard one...
fred,"Barney!   Grab that line!   Hurry! Barney scrambles up Fred's back, shoving a foot in Fred's face, but finally snatching the rope. He pulls on it... Fred throws his own weight into the effort..."
piltdown," It was Flintstone, Mr. Slate!"
pyrite,"That's right, Mr. Slate, it was Flintstone! BARNEY That's a lie, Mr. Slate!"

slate, Congratulations!
slate,Where on earth did you get it?

barney,"Well, actually, Fred, it was the other way ar-- Fred hisses between his teeth, repeats the ""Slate and me are just like this"" gesture he made earlier, points at Slate. "
slate,"The rest of you men go back to work. I want to talk to Flintstone and the personal reference alone. Come on, move, move... They go out, Piltdown looking furious."

slate, 'Fib-bre-rock' --
slate's staff," Slate takes the piece of material, leans it on the table so it catches the light. Despite himself, Lava comes over, examines the car hood... can't help but marvel at it as well. Meanwhile, Slate puts his arms around Fred and Barney."

barney,I never knew that.

piltdown,"Thank you, Brother Chairman. Fellow Buffaloes, I'm a man of few words. It's no secret that most of our lodge members are also members of Amalgamated Neolithic 101... which means that most of us aren't gonna be able to make our cave payments next month. So my agenda for tonight... ends right now. There's a time to be a Buffalo... there's a time ta be a brown nosin' double-crossin' creep... All heads turn and swivel to look at Fred... swivel back.

fred," We could end up with half a percent of nothing! BARNEY No, Fred, if they do that they'll be breakin' the law! Our brother Buffalo could go to jail!

LAVA  I mean... ah, why do you say that?"
lava,Tastes... different?
barney,"Yup. See, ever since I started with Fibrerock -- I mean, since me and Fred started with it, I always take a little taste of the Fibre foam. And tonight's batch, well... I didn't get much of it, but it seems a little off.  Can't fool the old taste buds, heh-heh. I think there might be an ingredient missing. So tomorrow, I'll run a couple of tests and stuff -- LAVA Rubble, Rubble! We're fighting a deadline to finish Slate City... and we're not pulling the plug on production to satisfy your tastebuds! If you ask me, you and your tastebuds are overworked ... overwrought... how long have you been with us, anyway? BARNEY Nine days, Mister Lava."
lava,"Jumping Jurrasic, no wonder you're so run down."
lava,"I'm authorizing a nice vacation for you, Rubble. Starting tomorrow. You can catch some rays, maybe invent something... hey, how about Fibrerock, the sequel, part II -- ? BARNEY But --"
lava,"No, don't try and thank me."
lava,"... As you can see, the Fibrerock is so light we're using it for construction, for furnishings... for everything. You can't stack a two-bedroom cave this high... but the sky's the limit with Fibrerock!"
slate,"'Sky's the limit'... 'sky's the limit'... why, these two buildings, they... they practically scrape the sky! We should call them... Slate scrapers! LAVA That's brilliant, Unc... Mister Slate. In fact, maybe you can help me with the centerpiece of the complex...  ... I wanna call 'em the FibreSphere and the '____' something Needle... but I just can't..."
slate," How about, 'Slate Needle'?"
lava,"'Slate Need...'  Oh, that reminds me, sign these, will you... just a few overruns ... minor cost problems... that's it... thank you..."
piltdown,Can we help you... sir?

fred, ... But Barney doesn't want to take a vacation -- he says he's gotta be here to check up on the Fibrefoam --
lava," -- Oh? Or check up on us? Emotionally, Lava turns, indicates a picture of Slate on the wall."
fred," Of course not, Mister Lava. But --"
lava,"Call me Jerry. Sit down, please... Fred complies. Lava winces as his designer FURNITURE CREAKS under Fred's weight, but he only says -- LAVA  ... the big everything. Lava smiles, prepares the tips on two cigars.      He puts each one in turn in a gizmo on his desk."
lava,"... Now, I know your pal Barney had a small part in the preliminary research and development of Fibrerock... FRED Well, actually, I wouldn't say small part... I'd say... LAVA Yes? FRED ... Kind of a medium-sized... well, almost medium-sized... well, really a semi-partial assistant counsulting type, of -- LAVA "
fred,"R-rockin' Leach? Indeed, it is he, and he smiles, extends his hands."
leach,"'Ello,  Fred. I've 'eard a lot h'about  you from Mister Lava. H'at's  why we're going to put you on our  program. FRED M-me?   On -- on television? LAVA  Barney who?"

fred,"W-what's wrong? LEACH Well, just look at that yard over there... barbecues and trikes, not exactly the right image... FRED  Maybe you could move those plants to block them out...?"
leach,"Good idea. Rodney, get 'hoppin' with those greens. The aide nods, gathers some workers. They start moving the potted plants. Puzzled, Wilma comes over. WILMA Fred, this was supposed to be a 'typical evening' at the Flintstones, and you invited fifty people I don't even know. Now what's going on? Where are they taking my ficus-sauruses? FRED It's the Rubble yard, Wilma.   It's just not the right image... He starts away, suddenly notices his own barbecue and trikes... quickly, without missing a stride, he tosses a tarp over them, slides a potted plant over for good measure. 179   BARNEY AND BETTY'S HOUSE - SAME TIME                          179"
barney,"Trust me, Betty. After the Fibrerock debut, he'll be the same old Fred. Both react to the sound of HAMMERING and SAWING. Curious, they go out the sliding bedroom door into the yard and see -- 180   THEIR POV - THE FENCE                                          180 The television crew has just finished nailing boards up over the top of the fence. Now the big potted plants are dropped into place. With each hammer stroke or thud a little more of the late afternoon sun is shut off until Barney and Betty are in shadow. Finally a canvas tarp is tossed as gracefully as pizza dough, sails into the Rubble yard and covers their bird bath. One last stray end lands on Barney's head."

fred,"Hello, hello. Bon soir. Good to see ya... glad you could make it..."
guest," Hello, Frank..."
fred,"Fred -- there's the bar, make yourself at home -- mi casa es votre casa, so, when in Rome and all that -- WILMA  I mean you're treating them horribly! What's come over you, Fred? Does a little money mean so much to you that you just turn your back on the things that really count? FRED Wilma, I'm shocked. I wouldn't do that. Okay, I admit it: I'm trying to make an impression here, I wanna look good, I wanna be a success..."
wilma,Arrrgh -- !
fred,"... Yas, yas, it's a challenging commodity market these days. Personally, I'm considering petrified forests, but they do say that volcano futures are ready to explode, ha, ha..."
fred,"Fred! He stumbles through the thinning crowd, clutching at elbows."
fred,"Hey, what's the hurry? We got a cake shaped like a piece of Fibrerock... I got it, how about some charades? No, even better, twenty questions: 'Am I animal, mineral, or fossil'...? Oh, I heard a great one the other day ... a guy walks in a bar with a duckasaurus on his head and the bartender says -- this'll kill you, the bartender says -- Fred stops, running out of steam along with his moment of glory. He stands alone on the lawn. Wilma slowly comes up to him."
wilma,"Fred... I... I'm sorry it's not working out... Fred turns, puts on a big smile. FRED Whaddya mean, not working out? They're goin' party hopping, that's all. That's what ya do in society, Wilma... you cruise around. They'll go over to Slate's shindig for a while, then they'll come back here. WILMA Fred..."
fred,"You go on over to Slate City, okay?"
wilma,"Fred, I want to be here with you -- "
wilma,"Come on, Pebbles. We're going to another party. PEBBLES Will there be real food there? WILMA We'll find out together. She takes the girl's hand and goes to the door, where the last of Leach's crew is just going out. Suddenly Betty catches up to her, Bam-Bam in tow."
betty,"Wilma, wait.   I'm going with you. WILMA Why? BETTY If friends can't do something stupid, who can? Wilma smiles, touched."
betty,Besides...  ... Maybe if we leave the boys alone...?
fred,"Just you and me now, Dino. Yeah. That's okay. Man and man's best friend."
fred, B... Barney?
barney," ... You feeling better, pal?"
fred,"Well, yeah.   But more of a --"
barney, Fool?
fred,Well -- BARNEY Slimeball? Louse? Jackass?  Barney... can... can you ever forgive me for being such a jerk?
barney," Aw, Barn... And he grabs Barney in a big bear hug. Tears in both their eyes, they slap each other on the back, two prehistoric sensitive guys. CUT TO:"
fashion parrot,"Because the clothes of the Stone Age are as extinct as stones themselves! Yes, thanks to the wonder of Fibrerockfibre, the world of high fashion will be totally transformed... by Fibre furs... Fibre frocks... Fibre foundations and Fibreshoes... it's to die for!"
barney,Yeah.   Too bad we never made the team. FRED So what? We made the team spirit. That's just as important... whatever happened to those cheerleader costumes?
barney,"You know Betty. She never throws anything away. He hauls out an old footlocker, opens it.    There they are. FRED  Boy.    Talk about memories. Fred tosses the cheerleader sweater to Barney, who grins, pulls it on. Fred also starts to get into his old ""uniform,"" but has to suck his gut in mightily. Finally, he can zip it up, stern to stem. FRED Back then, we thought a pop quiz was a big problem. We didn't know how good we had it. No problems, no worries..."
barney,"Yeah?   When did you notice that? FRED About an hour ago. BARNEY Boy, there's no fooling you, Fred. Suddenly, with a GROWING CREAKING, CRACKING and TINKLING, a scale model of Slate City in the corner begins to fall apart."
barney,It should be. There's enough coo-coo berry resin in there to petrify a brontosaurus -- Suddenly Barney gets it. He looks from the older models to the now decomposing little Fibresphere with growing awareness.
barney," -- The coo-coo berries! Fred, that's it!"
fred,What's it? BARNEY Remember I said the Fibrefoam tasted funny? It was the coo-coo sap that was missing!
fred,But.. why would -- BARNEY Why? Because coo-coo berries are as valuable as goldrock! And we've had tons of 'em delivered to the plant since we started... somebody musta got greedy --
fred,-- Not 'somebody' -- Lava!
lava,"You're certainly looking lovely this evening, Mrs. Flintstone. Life with a junior executive must agree with you. "
lava, Imagine how good you'd look with a senior executive.
wilma,"Oh?   Is Fred getting promoted? Lava laughs, sure she's kidding... then not so sure. The ventriloquist finishes to scattered applause. The kid bows, gets up... splashes across puddles of water on the stage area. The Headmistress of L'ecole Superior et al steps up. Behind her, the picture window displays the expanse of Slate City: The twin Slatescrapers framing endless rows of little tract houses stretching to the distant volcanic ridge.

Now, I would like to sank out mos' generous benefactress, Madame Slate for her fine support o'vair zee years -- She gestures into the audience, where Mrs. Slate stands, waves a gloved hand like the Queen Mother."
headmistress,"-- An' now, what better introduction could we 'ave for Mrs. Slate's vairy own gran' nephew... Poindexter Lava! She steps aside. Curtain rises on little Poindexter. He is carrying a leather-and-bone accordion. He begins to play: POINDEXTER  'Dino of Spain, I adore you Right from the moment I saw you -- '"

barney,We just tell Mister Slate that all 500 acres of his development are going to crumble into dust any minute.  Then we zap the stairs and corridors with some of this coo-coo sap. I just hope we have enough to get everybody out -- whoops!
