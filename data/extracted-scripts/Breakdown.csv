howard,"How about it, Jeff?"
jeff,Done.
jeff, Sniper.
howard,Where?
jeff,High-rise. Top floor.        Window in the middle.
howard, Stay on him. Stay on him.        Now go back to the woman. Now!
howard,Stay tight on the sniper. Jesus -- look at him! He's about fourteen! Don't lose this!
jeff,He sees her.
howard,"Stay on her. If she runs, widen and try to get her and sniper in the same frame."
jeff,I said he sees her.
howard,I heard you.    Stay on her.
jeff, No... no...
jeff,Sniper!   Sniper! Sni--
street," The woman looks up in Jeff's direction, confused, breaking stride --  We hear a burst of automatic gunfire --"
street," The woman's body jolts from the impact of the bullets. The books go flying from her hand. She spins to the pavement, her hair billowing."
jeff," just stands there, a shattered expression. The camera hangs at his side. He stares at the dead woman as a pool of dark blood expands around her body.  CUT TO:"
amy,"God, I missed you."
jeff,Me too.
amy,Let's get out of here. Where's your equipment? Don't tell me you checked it?
jeff, This is it.
amy,No camera?
amy,No nothing?
amy,Ah ha.
amy,Jeff?
amy,Can I come in?
amy,Couldn't sleep?
amy,"I remember when you took that. We had fun on that trip, didn't we?"
amy,You want to talk about it?
jeff,There's nothing to talk about.
amy,"C'mon, Jeff."
jeff,I told you. I quit.   Walked out. end of story.
amy,That's   it?
amy,Whatever happened back there wasn't your responsibility. You can't keep beating yourself up over it.
amy,What do you think? You could have stopped that girl from getting killed?
jeff,You don't understand...
jeff,It was different this time.
jeff,I talked to Reynolds.  He thinks I could still get the job at the San Diego station.
amy,"Oh, Jeff, you didn't..."
jeff,"Think of it. Low pressure, a steady paycheck. So I shoot city council meetings -- how bad could it be?"
amy,Is that what you really want -- or are you just running away?
jeff,"Who's running? It's good money, full benefits. I'm tired of freelance. We could finally put some money in the bank."
amy,You know I'll never stand in your way. But you've worked so hard. Are you sure you want to throw it away?
jeff,"Throw what away? Don't you get it? I don't do anything. I sit, I watch, I film -- I let it happen."
amy,You're supposed to let it happen. It's your job.
jeff,"No, Amy.   It's my excuse."
jeff,"That girl... it's like I was paralyzed. I wanted to do something, but I didn't. I just stood there and watched her get killed."
jeff,"Please, babe, I need this.     Say yes and we'll take as long    as you want -- drive cross-country    and make a vacation out of it.     What do you say?"
amy,"Jesus, Jeff..."
jeff,Sorry.     I took my eyes off the road.
amy," Maybe it's time we took a break, you know?"
jeff,I'll pull over next chance we get.  Sorry...
trucker,On vacation?
amy,"Sort of.    We're moving, actually."
trucker,Whereabouts?
amy,California. We thought we'd take the scenic route.
trucker,"Huh. In that case, you oughta try the Pass Road, 'bout thirty miles west. Real pretty, makes a loop through the hills, then hooks back up with the highway."
amy,Thanks. I'll mention it to my husband.
trucker,"Okay, then. Good luck.   Enjoy the rest of your trip."
earl, Nice car.
jeff,Thanks.
earl,"Air, C.D., leather -- I guess you sprung for the whole nine yards."
jeff,I guess.
earl,"Then again, out here, what you really need's a C.B. radio."
jeff,Is that right?
earl,"'Course, if you use a C.B., you gotta have a handle."
earl,"How about Shit-for-Brains?  You damn near killed us back there, boy."
jeff,"Look, I'm sorry, I didn't see you. You pulled out in front of me."
earl,The hell I did. I saw what happened.
jeff,"How about if we just forget it, okay? I'm sorry it happened. I don't want any trouble."
earl, Yeah.     I bet you don't.
earl,"Howdy, ma'am. Caught this fellow tryin' to steal your Cherokee."
amy,What was that about?
jeff,Nothing. Guy in the truck. Thinks I tried to hit him.
jeff,"C'mon, let's go."
amy,You want me to drive?
jeff,Later.   Just get in.
amy,Is something wrong?
jeff,"No, let's just go."
amy,"This isn't the Grand Prix, you know."
amy,What's bothering you?
jeff,I told you. Nothing.  The guy was an asshole.
jeff,What'd you get?
amy,"Junk food fiesta. Sno Balls, Yoo Hoo, Moon pies... can you believe they still make this stuff?"
jeff,You kidding. It's probably gourmet cuisine around here.
amy," This is crazy. Look at this. Says if you win this mail-in contest, you can choose either ninety thousand dollars or ninety thousand doughnuts."
amy,What would you do with ninety thousand doughnuts?
jeff,I dunno... Sell 'em for thirty cents each and pay off this car.
amy,"Very funny.  Alright, what about ninety thousand dollars? What would you do with that?"
jeff,"I don't know.    Look, Amy, I'm not --"
jeff,Sonofabitch!! My camera!        He stole my camera!
amy, Who?
jeff,The redneck at the gas station! He lifted it right under my nose! My brand new Nikon.  Goddammit.
amy,Should we go back?
jeff,"What's the use. He's probably halfway to Bumblefuck now, the bastard."
amy,"Look, maybe if we call the cops --"
jeff,What the hell?
amy,What'd you do?
jeff,Nothing.   I --
jeff,Hang on -- I can't steer!
amy, Found your camera.
jeff,Ow!
amy,Are you okay?
jeff,I'm fine.
jeff," I said I'm fine, okay?"
amy,Out of range?
amy,"What's going on, Jeff?"
jeff,What's it look like?      I'm trying to fix the car.
amy,Not the car.
jeff,What?
amy,What's going on with you?
amy,It's been a month since you got back. You can't keep shutting me out like this.
amy,"Jeff, I'm talking to you."
jeff," Look, I really don't want to go into this right now. I'm changing jobs, our finances are fucked, and we're stuck in the middle of nowhere. So could we maybe just fix the --"
jeff,"Christ, not these guys..."
jeff,Asshole...
amy, Jeff --
jeff,What the hell?
amy,What's he doing?
jeff,I don't know.
down highway," the PICKUP STARTS UP again. It pulls another U-turn and drives away, melting into the desert."
jeff,Yeah.   Our car broke down.
red, I figured that much. You want a hand pushing it off the road?
jeff,"Thanks, I'd appreciate it.    Amy, you want to steer?"
jeff,Think you could radio a tow truck for us?
red,"I sure would if I could, mister, but my C.B. blew a fuse this morning. I'm waiting till I hit the truck stop on I-40 to get it fixed."
jeff,How far is that?
red,About 60 miles.
jeff, Oh.
red,"I'd offer to take a look, but it's hard to say with these new engines. Used to be, you could give 'em a kick and a holler and they'd start right up. Now it's all computers and chips."
jeff,It's a new car.
red,That could be the problem. You been running it pretty fast?
red,"Tell you what. If you want a ride, there's a little diner up the road. Belle's. They got a pay phone. You could call a tow truck from there."
jeff,Nice     of you to offer. But we've got a     lot of stuff in the car. I think     we're better off waiting for a cop     to come along.
red, Good    luck.
amy,Are you nuts?
jeff,We don't know this guy.
amy,He's offering to help. It       could be hours before anyone else      comes along. It's 100 degrees.        You really want to be stuck out      here?
jeff,"Amy, I've got my equipment in the car. All our stuff. What if those guys come back and we're not here?  Jesus... don't be stupid..."
amy,Stupid is sitting out here waiting for a cop when we already have a ride.
amy,Stupid was letting you talk me into leaving Boston.
amy,Excuse me? Do you think you could drop me at that diner?
red," Sure thing. How about you, mister? I could take you both just as easy."
amy,That's okay. My husband wants to stay with the car. I'll just get my purse.
jeff,What do you think you're doing?
amy,"I'm going to the diner. I'm going to call a tow truck. Then I'm going to order an iced tea and wait. Good-bye, Jeff."
jeff, You're not riding with that guy. End of story.
amy,You wanted to be alone. Well... you're alone. Why don't you take the time to get your head together?
red,"Watch your step, ma'am."
jeff,Oh for Christ's sake...
jeff,Excuse me.
jeff,I was supposed to meet my wife here.
jeff,"Dark hair, slender, about five- five. Wearing a pale blue Benetton shirt."
bartender,A pale blue what?
jeff,Benetton shirt.
bartender,Hank!  Your order's ready.  I been busy. They come and go.
jeff,It would've been within the last half hour. She might've been with a trucker?
bartender,A trucker.
jeff,Guy with a baseball cap.   Driving an eighteen wheeler.
bartender,Don't ring a bell.
jeff,You sure?
bartender,"Hey! Man here's looking for his wife, dark hair, button-on shirt, travelin' with a guy in a baseball cap. Anybody see 'em?"
flo,"Looks like she got away from ya, cowboy."
jeff,Could she have left a message with another one of your employees?
bartender,Don't see how. I'm the only one who works here.
jeff,I don't understand. Is there another Belle's Diner?
bartender, No siree. Definitely not.
jeff, Shit.
jeff,"Excuse me, how far is the next town?"
bartender,About twenty miles.
jeff,"Look, if my wife comes in -- her name is Amy -- tell her I was here. Tell her to stay put till I get back, not to move. Would you do that, please?"
bartender, Okay.
peterbilt, The 18-wheeler that picked up Amy.    Cruising leisurely.  Jeff presses the accelerator...
jeff,"C'mon, you fat-ass.    Pull over."
jeff,Pull over!    Pull over!
highway," Jeff swerves onto the far shoulder as the RV whooshes past in the opposite direction, HORN BLARING."
cherokee," Jeff is rattled, catching his breath.      He swings back onto the road."
red,"Jesus, pal, what the hell you doing?"
jeff,I was signaling you to stop. Didn't you see me?
red,No.
jeff,Where's my wife?
red,Huh?
jeff,My wife.     Where is she?
red,How should I know where your wife is?
jeff,I checked at the diner.      No one saw her there.
red,"Mister, I don't know what you're talking about."
jeff,You gave her a ride. You were supposed to drop her at Belle's diner.
red,Nope.   Sorry.
jeff,"How can you not remember? It was just half an hour ago, for chrissakes!"
red,"Mister, I never seen you before in my life."
jeff, What the hell are you doing -- ?
jeff,Amy?    Amy?!   You in there?
red,"Look, mister, I don't know what you want, but --"
jeff,"I want my fucking wife, is what I want! What have you done to her?!"
jeff,"Officer, I need your help!"
sheriff boyd,What's your problem?
jeff,"I don't know, this guy has my wife!"
sheriff boyd,"Calm down, sir. Tell me what's going on."
jeff,I don't know what the hell's going on. Last time I saw her she was with this guy in his truck. Now he's saying he's never seen her!
red,"Officer, he's crazy -- I don't know what he's talking about."
jeff,"Don't lie, you son of a bitch!"
sheriff boyd,"All right -- everybody just calm down.  Sir, you want to tell me what happened?"
jeff,"Our car broke down. This guy stopped to help us, said he'd drive my wife to a pay phone.    But she never showed up."
sheriff boyd, Sir?
red,"I don't know, officer. I'm driving along, suddenly this fella runs me off the road and starts hollering about his wife. I swear, I never seen the guy before."
sheriff boyd,And you didn't give his wife a ride?
red,"No, sir."
jeff,He's lying!
sheriff boyd,"Sir, all right with you if I search your truck?"
red,"Hell yes, officer. Go right ahead. Name's Red, by the way. Red Barr.  My permits are all current. You can check 'em out."
sheriff boyd,That won't be necessary yet. Just stand back behind the line. Both of you.
sheriff boyd," All right, let's see your license and registration."
sheriff boyd,"What are you hauling today, Mr. Barr?"
red,"Nothing, empty load. I'm heading to Fresno for a pick up -- ball bearings or something."
sheriff boyd, Long way to go empty.
red,Tell me about it. Too much competition nowadays. One horse guys like me gotta drive halfway 'cross the country just to get a payin' job.
jeff, Are we gonna keep looking or what?
sheriff boyd,"Yes, we are.  Sir, I'm gonna have to see everything."
red,No problem.   I understand.
sheriff boyd, Those yours?
red,Yeah. Personal stuff. Clothes and whatnot. You want to take a look?
sheriff boyd,No. I think we're pretty much done here. You're free to go.
jeff," Whoa, whoa -- wait a sec. That's it? You're not going to question him anymore?"
sheriff boyd,"Sir, I searched the truck. There's no evidence of suspicious activity, no sign of struggle."
red,"Look, I don't mean to butt in, but maybe you got my truck confused with someone else's."
jeff," Go to hell, you sonofabitch --"
sheriff boyd,"Hey! Hey! You want to get arrested? Now the man has a point. This is a plain-looking, John Doe truck. Maybe you did get them mixed up."
sheriff boyd,Hey!
sheriff boyd,"Mr. Taylor, either you come down from there or I'm going to have to arrest you."
jeff,It was him.    It was this truck.
sheriff boyd,"Uh-huh, I can see that. Did you get a license plate?"
jeff,No.
sheriff boyd,What about the information on the door panel. You recall any of that?
jeff,I wasn't paying attention.
sheriff boyd,"Mr. Taylor, did you by any chance have a beef with your wife today?"
jeff,What does that have to do with anything?
sheriff boyd,"Well, for starters, maybe she left you."
jeff,I don't believe this...
sheriff boyd,"I've seen it a hundred times. Lovers, married couples, gay guys. You put two people in a car long enough, they'll go at it. Hell, I've even seen men dump their women on the side of the road, and vice versa."
jeff,My wife did not leave me.
red," Officer, I'm sorry, I'd like to stay and help, but I really got to make it to Fresno..."
sheriff boyd,"I understand. Go ahead, sir.         I appreciate your cooperation."
jeff,This is insane. You're just going to let him go?
sheriff boyd,"I've got his information. If we need to find him later, we'll know where to look."
red,"Much obliged.  Good luck findin' your wife, mister. No hard feelings."
sheriff boyd,"Sir, I believe you that your wife is missing. Maybe you got confused about what truck she got into, maybe you had a fight -- you don't have to tell me. The point is I'm trying to help."
sheriff boyd,The town of Brackett's 31 miles that way. My deputy's name is Len Carver. He's a good man. He'll help you fill out the necessary forms if you want to report your wife missing.
sheriff boyd,"If you want my opinion, your wife is probably around here. Lost or plenty pissed off and giving you a scare. Either way, she'll turn up."
sheriff boyd," 10-4, dispatch. Tell her I'm on my way."
jeff,I want your name and badge number.
sheriff boyd,Sheriff Arthur Boyd. 226-93. This really isn't necessary --
jeff,"Don't tell me what's necessary, goddamnit. I'm noting the exact time of this conversation. 10:52 A.M."
sheriff boyd," Suit yourself, Mr. Taylor."
deputy carver,Is this a recent picture?
jeff,Two months old.
deputy carver,She still wear her hair like that?
jeff,Yes.
deputy carver,"We'll certainly do our best, Mr. Taylor. There's over a hundred thousand people go missing in this country every year. Runaways, deadbeat dads, dropouts, folks hiding from the I.R.S. -- all vanishing without a trace."
deputy carver,"Now I'm not saying she's one of them. I sure hope not. But unless there's a ransom demand or evidence of forced abduction, believe me, the F.B.I. won't even look at your case till it's been 24 hours."
deputy carver,"Nevertheless, we'll sure keep our eyes peeled. How's that sound?"
jeff,Did she come in?
bartender, Didn't see her.
jeff,"You didn't see her, or she didn't come in?"
bartender,"Buddy, I told you the last time. I'm busy. Maybe she came in, maybe she didn't. All I know is, I didn't see her."
barfly," None of my business, mister. But if I was you I'd take a look in the ladies room."
jeff,Amy?
flo,Hey -- what the hell you doing?!
jeff,I want to see your order slips.
bartender,What?
jeff,You write down the names.   I want to see them.
bartender,"What are you, nuts? I don't have to show you jack shit."
jeff,"If my wife came in here, then her name's in that pile."
bartender,You calling me a liar?
bartender,"Mister, I've had just about enough of you."
jeff,Let me see the fucking slips.
bartender,"Now, mister, you're going to have to leave."
jeff,"Please, I need the phone -- I have to call the police!"
sluggish man, My name's Billy. You the feller lookin' for his wife?
jeff,How'd you know? Did you see her?
jeff,"Please, if you know something, anything, tell me."
jeff,What?    When?
billy,Oh man. Never shoulda opened my damn mouth. Now I'm gonna git it.
jeff,"No one's going to hurt you, Billy. Just tell me what you saw."
billy,She came in on a truck.   A big white one.
jeff,Yes...
billy,Then she... she got in another truck.
jeff,Another truck? With who?
billy,"Dunno. Some men. Bad men. They say I'm a dummy, but I ain't. I see things."
jeff,Do you know where they went?
billy,Uh-huh.    Route seven.   Up by the river.
jeff,Where by the river?
billy,Dunno. They don't tell me that kind of stuff.
jeff,Who doesn't? The bartender?      The men in the truck?
billy,I ain't talking to you no more.
jeff,"Billy, I need you to come to the police. If you tell them what you saw, they'll be able to help me."
billy,"Man, you're the dummy."
billy,Don't you git it? The police is the ones in on it!
jeff,"C'mon... work, goddammit..."
jeff,Fuck.
jeff, Yes.
jeff,"Hello, Steve? It's Jeff Taylor... Listen, I -- don't put me on hold! I need a favor... I've gotta talk to that friend of yours at the F.B.I... No, it's about Amy, she's missing --"
jeff,I said Amy's been --
jeff,Fuck!
jeff,"Yes, I'm still here.       No -- don't call back -- Steve?!       Steve?!"
jeff,Goddammit!
chainlink fence," covered with high-visibility markers stretched across the road. The sign: ""ROAD CLOSED."""
jeff,Shit!
earl, Out of the car! Put your hands where I can see 'em!
earl,"I said get out, dammit!   Now!"
cherokee," peels out in reverse, snaking wildly side to side, aiming for the chainlink fence.  It BURSTS the FENCE!   Poles and chain mesh go flying!"
jeff," GUNS the ENGINE. The Cherokee bounces wildly on the rutted, storm-damaged road. He yanks the four-wheel- drive lever."
dirt road," The huge pickup streaks after the Cherokee, its 7.5-LITER V10 ROARING, oversized tires devouring the terrain."
jeff," GUNS the ENGINE on the washboard road surface, the vibration nearly shaking the suspension apart while --"
ram," keeps pace in the dust from its wake. Inside the cab, Earl can be seen speaking on a CB transmitter."
jeff," throws the Cherokee into a sharp turn in the road. As the car rounds the bend, he looks up, reacting, as --"
idled bulldozer, blocks the road at a construction site. More unattended earthmoving equipment fills the road beyond.
jeff," brakes wildly. To his right, a cliff goes straight up; on the left, a guardrail protects a steep ravine.  He cuts the wheel left, CRASHES through the GUARDRAIL and plunges into the ravine!"
cherokee, lands on the passenger side with a SPLASH and comes to rest half-submerged in the RUSHING WATER.
earl,Sonofabitch...
inside cherokee," The world is sideways. Water rushes into the car. Jeff is strapped into the driver's seat by the seatbelt. The AIRBAG DEFLATES with a HISS.  Jeff grimaces in pain. He looks around, blinking.   The river is flowing right through the Cherokee!  Luggage, styrofoam hamburger clamshells and empty Coke cans bob on the surface of the water.  Jeff fumbles with the seatbelt release. The belt comes free and he drops suddenly into the water on the passenger side.  He gets to his feet, reaches overhead to unlatch the driver's side door and pushes it open.  He hoists himself through the door."
earl,Fuck!
underwater," Jeff breaststrokes for all he's worth. Sand swirls in the swift current. He pushes away from a boulder in his path.  He swims until his lungs are bursting, then surfaces for air."
earl,Goddammit...
behind rock," Jeff surfaces and gulps in air, staying out of sight of Earl on the bank. Then he is down again."
earl,He's getting away!
in rapids," Jeff is carried over the rocks by the fast-moving current. He slams into a boulder, letting out a cry and swallowing a mouthful of water.  A downed tree hangs over the river. Jeff grabs desperately and takes hold of a branch. He's got it!  Hanging on to the branch, he notices a familiar object floating past in the water: the ""90,000 Donuts"" pack.  Jeff tries to haul himself from the river. The BRANCH bends under his weight. Then it comes free with a CRACK!  Jeff is carried downstream on the rushing water."
earl,He's in the water!   I just saw him!
below rapids," The river has turned slow again.  Jeff fights to his feet in the shallows and staggers to the bank. He drops to his knees, retching.  Clutching his ribs, he raises his head and looks upriver. For the moment, there is no sign of Earl. But he could appear anytime.  Jeff gets to his feet, wincing. He looks up at the rocky canyon wall bordering the river. It's steep but scalable.  He begins climbing.  DISSOLVE TO:"
al,... can't believe you let him get away...
earl,You try chasing... through this shit...
al,Fuck... this is what happens when you get one without the other...
earl,He coming around?
billy,Should be... I clocked him pretty good...
billy,"Rise and shine, dad."
billy,"C'mon, shake a leg."
jeff, Where is she?
billy,"Give us some answers and you might find out. According to her, you've got a pretty good pile of ready cash sitting in the bank. Is that true?"
jeff,There's some... yeah...
billy,"Uh-huh... well, 'some' doesn't cut it. Your wife gave us a dollar figure. I want the same exact from you."
jeff, I don't -- there's different accounts... the balance fluctuates...
billy,"Fluctuates, my ass. If a hotshot like you ain't tracking his bottom line, it'd be the first time in history.  What do you think, Earl?"
earl,"We been fucked with, is what I think. Little slut lied to us. Put 'em on the spot, they'll say anything to stay alive."
billy,"Yeah, I suppose. Too bad.  Waste of time. Plug him."
jeff, Ninety thousand.
billy,Say again.
jeff, Ninety thousand dollars.
earl,Get out.   Don't try anything stupid.
red,"You're a tough man to get a hold of, Jeffrey."
jeff, What do you want?
red,It's not me we're talking about. Question is what you want.
red,"See, I've got something you might want to buy. Can't show you the merchandise right now, but I can describe it for you. About five- five, hundred and fifteen pounds. I'd say three, maybe four of that is tits. Black curly hair upstairs and down. Interested?"
jeff,You sonofabitch --
red,Bring him up here.
red,"Welcome to Brackett, Jeff. If ever there was a two-bit shithole in the middle of nowhere, this is it. One gas station, a half-dozen stores and a V.F.W. hall.  See that building?"
red,That's the bank. Brackett Commerce Bank. You with me?
red,"Then here's the drill. You're gonna walk in there and tell the manager you want an express wire in the amount of $90,000 from your account in Boston. Got your wallet?"
red,You ask for the money in cash. Small bills. 
jeff,How do I know she's still alive?
billy,Shut up.
red,She's tucked away someplace safe. You get her back as soon as we get the money. Simple as that.
red,"Now a smart guy like you, you're already thinking about calling the cops, right?"
red," Iron Man to Blacktop, let's open the gate."
red,"Like I said, Jeff, if you want to call the cops, there's nothing I can do. Hell, with the fire you've got in your eyes right now, I figure you're fixing on calling the F.B.I., C.I.A. -- even the 82nd Airborne."
red,"Problem is, you can see this town for miles around. So ask yourself: How's the law gonna get here? They gonna fly in? Drive in? Either way, we'll see 'em. So let me be very clear: if we see one unmarked car, one plane, one human being who even smells like a cop -- this deal is dead."
red,Now take a look at the building with the flagpole.
red,"That's your deadline. If for any reason one of those cops pulls into town before I'm looking at a bag of money, your wife is dead, you're shit out of luck and we're gone for good."
red,"See, that's why there's no risk to us in this thing. You do the legwork. We sit back, we watch, we listen to our scanners, we monitor you every step of the way. If at any moment we don't like something, we split. Period.  Helluva lot safer than sticking up 7-11s, wouldn't you say?"
red,Put this on. You can't go into the bank like that.
red,"How about it, Jeff? Time to get the show on the road?"
jeff,I need to see the manager. I need a wire transfer from my bank in Boston.
calhoun,Yes... sir. I'm the manager. Would you like to have a seat?
calhoun,Sir?
jeff, What?
calhoun,I said you can have a seat if you want.
jeff,Right.
jeff,"Here's my driver's license, credit card if you need it, my account number in Boston... How long is this going to take?"
calhoun,Are you all right?
jeff," Yes, I'm fine. Look, that account only has $5,000 in it. How much can you advance me on my credit card?"
calhoun,Excuse me?
jeff," My credit card. I've got a $6,000 limit. Can you advance me the whole $6,000?"
calhoun,"No, I can't. For non-customers the limit is $500 a day. Sir, are you sure you're all right?"
jeff,"Yes, I'm fine. Just... transfer the money, okay?"
jeff,"Look, I'm going to tell you something. Whatever happens, just keep filling out that form, okay?"
calhoun, Sir?
jeff,There are people watching --
calhoun,"Yes, I am."
cowboy,Lady over there said to see you about a car loan.
calhoun," Certainly, sir. Would you like to have a seat?"
calhoun," You were saying, Mr. Taylor?"
jeff,Just... transfer the money.
jeff,Would you tell the manager I want the money in these denominations?
jeff,I'm here.
jeff,The whole thing. Ninety thousand.
jeff,When do I see my wife?
calhoun,"Marie, this is Roger Calhoun down at the bank. Is the Sheriff there?  Well, maybe it's nothing, but you might tell him we just had a fellow in here acting kind of strange..."
earl,Toss the envelope on the seat.
jeff,No.   First you tell me where she is.
earl,"Wrong, asshole. First you give me the money, then you find out. Unless you want me to shoot you dead right here on the highway."
earl,Now lift your shirt and jacket and turn around.
earl,"Turn around, hands behind your back, and step toward the truck."
earl,"Now get up in the truck, knees on the floor. Do it now!"
jeff,I gave you the money.     Now let her go.
earl,'Let her go.'    Do I look like I have her?
jeff,What the hell --
earl, Gotcha.
earl,"You gotta be the dumbest motherfuck yet. You think we picked you out of the blue? New car, Massachusetts plates -- probably be days before anyone misses you. Hell, you shoulda got the bumper sticker that goes with it: 'Rich Assholes Looking for Trouble!'"
earl,"I'd have loved to see the look on your face when that car seized up.  Help, help, I ain't got no power!"
earl,"You know what I'm gonna do first with your money, boy? Well, do you?"
earl, I'll give you a hint. Only one thing smells better than money. You wanta guess what?
earl,What the hell?
earl,These are... it's nothing but singles...  You lyin' sonofabitch!
earl,Aaagghh!
jeff,"Where is she, goddammit?   What'd you do with her?"
jeff,Where is she?!
earl, Fuck you!
jeff,You like that?     How about this?
jeff,"Four wheel anti-lock brakes, you sonofabitch! You want to try 'em again?"
jeff,"How about an emergency stop? You want to try that, Earl? Where is she?"
earl,I don't know!
jeff,"Fuck you, you don't!"
earl,Stop!
jeff,Is that what you want? You really want me to stop? 'Cause I bet this baby stops on a dime!
sheriff boyd,What the hell?
jeff,"End of the line, Earl! How about it? You gonna tell me?"
earl,She's with Billy.
jeff,Yeah?     Where's that?
earl,I don't know!    Driving around!
sheriff boyd," Repeat, I am in pursuit of a Dodge Ram pickup. Request back-up, repeat, request back-up!"
sheriff boyd,"Jesus Christ --  Dispatch! Suspect identified as one Jeffrey Taylor, repeat, Jeffrey Taylor!"
jeff,Where were you taking the money?
earl, To the truck stop...
jeff,Where?
earl,Main highway... Texaco...
jeff,I know where she is!   My wife!
sheriff boyd, Drop the gun!
jeff,You don't understand!      She's been kidnapped!
sheriff boyd,I understand plenty. Now get down on the ground or I'll shoot!
sheriff boyd,You there -- in the pickup! You all right? Can you get out?
earl,"Yeah! Just don't shoot me, officer! He's crazy, I tell you!"
sheriff boyd,"Well, get out dammit!"
jeff,"Officer, please. You gotta listen to me --"
sheriff boyd," C'mon out, sir. It's safe --"
sheriff boyd, Shots fired... Officer down... Suspect...
red," I don't know, dammit, he was supposed to be here a half hour ago. There's reports on the police band about a cop down and this place is crawling with uniforms..."
red,"Look, I'm getting out of here. Stay off the airwaves. Bring the girl and meet me at the barn... You got that?"
cop," thanks the couple, calls out something to his fellow officers."
jeff," runs alongside the farm truck, using it as a shield. He overtakes the truck, cuts across its path. The farmer BLARES his HORN.  Jeff glances left. Red's tractor trailer is traveling across the crowded parking area, slowly gaining speed. Jeff sprints in front of a moving car.  The driver jerks to a halt and HONKS, catching the attention of a nearby cop. Jeff quickly turns away, avoiding being seen.  Red's 18-wheeler turns toward the access road. Jeff looks around, panicked. More cops are spreading out on foot. They'll notice him any second.    80.  CONTINUED:  Jeff crouches low and scurries underneath a slow-moving postal truck. The truck speeds up, nearly crushing him under the rear wheel assembly.  Jeff rolls out of the path of the giant wheels, gets to his feet on the other side and finds himself...  ... in the path of another huge truck!  A cop is standing only 20 feet away! Jeff goes underneath another trailer, crawling between the moving wheels. He springs to his feet.  Red's Peterbilt is pulling away!  Jeff runs for all he's worth. His arms and legs pump furiously. He runs abreast of the truck...  ... and seizes the spare tire mount!"
jeff, Hello? Can you hear me? This is Jeff Taylor. I need to talk to the deputy.
jeff,"The name is Jeffrey Taylor. I just witnessed your sheriff being shot. Now put someone on, goddammit!"
jeff,Hello?
deputy carver,It's no good. He's not talking. You better mobilize your boys.
deke,"Daddy, you're home!"
red,"Hey, Deke, you miss me?"
arleen,"Deke, get back to bed! I said now!  Warren? I thought you were coming back next week."
arleen,... but it's four in the morning. Why can't Al and Billy come some other time?
red," I told you, we've got some stuff to take care of. Won't be more than a couple of hours -- I promise."
red,"Say, Deke, how 'bout opening up the barn for your daddy?"
red,"Deke, c'mon over here, I got something for you."
red,Guess which hand.
deke, This one.
red,Nope.    Try again.
deke, This hand.
red,Nope.
deke, Dad...
red," Okay, okay, I'll give it to you."
deke,Cool!
red,"Deke?   Deke, you back there?"
inside trailer," Red shrugs, lets it go. He resumes unloading boxes, tosses down a full set of Louis Vuitton luggage. He lugs the items into the barn."
al,"Man, if I never see another couple from Massachusetts it'll be too soon."
red,Tell me about it.   You get any word on Earl?
billy," There's reports of an accident up Five Mile, but that's about it."
billy,I told you we shoulda gotten rid of 'em like that couple up in Utah. Nice and clean.
red,"So it got a little fucked up -- so what? We stay out of the area for a while, things will cool off."
red,"Dammit, Al, what the hell you doing?"
al,Figured I'd get started on the jewelry.
red,"Fuck that, you can work on it later. Help us with the girl."
red,Must've died from the exhaust.
red,I'll get some plastic. We'll bury her before it gets light out.
al, Aagh!
al,Goddamn.   Scared me half to death.
billy," Gotcha good, huh, Al? Oughta be more careful next time."
al,"Shut up.  Lemme do her, Red. I'll cut her head off right now."
red,"Shit, it's my wife. Help me get her in the freezer.  Just a second, Arleen."
amy," squirms on the hay-strewn floor. Her clothes are ripped, face bruised. She looks up, reacting: Jeff's eye is visible in the knothole.  Their gaze meets... and holds..."
red,"Don't   worry, honey. It's not as bad as   it sounds. It'll take you about   10 minutes to suck the air out.    Probably won't even feel it."
barn hayloft, Jeff watches helplessly as...
red,"C'mon, let's go."
arleen,Well finally. Are you coming to breakfast? I've been calling you.
red,"Sure thing, honey."
jeff,"Amy?   Amy, can you hear me?"
jeff, Amy?
jeff,"Hang on, baby. They're in the house; I can't use the lights. I'm gonna get you out."
jeff,Fuck!
jeff,"It's not working. If I make any more noise, they'll hear."
jeff,"I'm going to get you out of there, Amy."
jeff,"I love you.  Please, God, let her still be alive."
jeff," Fuck you, asshole."
hallway," toward the voices. VIDEO GAME sound effects emanate from a room off the hall. Jeff flattens against the wall, peers into the living room.  Seated on the floor with his back   to Jeff, Deke is playing Nintendo on a wide-screen   television.  Various items are scattered about: stereo    speakers, a jukebox, a brand new Nordic Track. There is    a rifle rack across the room.  Stepping past the doorway, Jeff continues down the hall toward..."
red,"... So there I am, it's a howling snow storm, I've got 2000 live chickens that are supposed to be in Denver days ago, and this cop is busting my balls because I haven't got chains..."
red,"So what happens but   this big old rooster, damn thing   must've weighed ten pounds,   he reaches out toward that highway   patrolman..."
red,"... just reaches out with his beak, see, and..."
jeff,Give me the key.
red," Now hold on, mister. I don't know who you are or what you want --"
jeff,Give me the fucking key!
red, Mister --
jeff,"Don't mister me, you sonofabitch! My wife is locked in a hole in your fucking barn! You don't give me the key, I'll blow your fucking head off!"
arleen, Warren? What's going on?
red,"I don't know, honey.        Just stay calm --"
jeff, Ever wonder where all this stuff comes from?
jeff,"You don't want to do that, kid. Just put the gun down."
red," Don't listen to him, Deke.        Keep the gun on him."
jeff,Put the gun down.
deke, My daddy keeps his rifle loaded all the time. He showed me in case I needed to protect Mommy when he's away.
jeff,"I understand that, Deke. I'm not gonna hurt Mommy. But if you pull that trigger, there's a chance I'll still kill your father."
red,"He's lying, Deke. He can't get me. Just pull the trigger."
jeff,"No, Deke, don't listen to him. He's wrong."
red,"Plug him, boy!     Do what I tell you!"
red,"That's right, boy.       Do it.   Don't worry about me."
jeff,"Deke, no -- !"
al,"Oww -- goddammit, you little shit!"
jeff,Don't fucking move!
jeff,Deke?   Deke?   Get on your feet!
jeff,"It's okay, kid. Go over there, stand next to your mother. Hurry up."
jeff,"Okay... on your feet.   Now, everybody!"
jeff,Let's go.      Out.
red,"Do like he says, Arleen.      He's crazy."
jeff, Okay. Reach into your pocket and hand the key to your wife.
red,"This ain't gonna work, boy."
jeff, Do it.
red,"It's okay, Arleen.      Take it."
jeff," Okay, now unlock it."
jeff,"Good.  Now give me the keys.  Deke, push the door open. Quickly."
jeff,"That's enough, Deke.  Let's go. Move it."
jeff,"Deke, I need you to open this."
jeff,"It's okay, Deke. There's a freezer down there with a woman in it. I need you to let her out."
red, The switch is on the right.
red,"It's all right, son.     Just ignore that stuff."
jeff, Deke!    You at the freezer?
jeff,"Okay. You're almost done. Just open it up, let the woman out."
deke,She's all tied up with tape.
jeff,You got that Swiss Army knife your dad gave you?
jeff,Good man. Use that.   Make sure you don't hurt her.
jeff, You better pray she's all right.
jeff,Amy!!!
jeff,"Amy, come up here!"
amy,They were going to kill me.
jeff,"I know, baby. It's okay.       They can't hurt you now."
jeff, Okay.    Everybody in the cellar.
jeff,Do it!
red,"Remember this moment, pretty boy. 'Cause whatever happens, no matter how far you run, I will hunt you down and kill you like a dog."
jeff,Go to hell.
jeff,Let's get out of here.
jeff,"Amy, no!    It's not safe --"
amy, But there's a phone inside.         We have to call the police.
jeff,One of them's still loose.      C'mon -- this way!
reveal billy," lurking in the shadows at the corner of the barn, watching."
jeff,Hello?   Hello?     Anybody home?
jeff, Hello? Anyone home?
jeff,"C'mon, c'mon..."
jeff," Hello! This is Jeff Taylor. I'm reporting an emergency... I don't know the address, the house belongs to a Red Barr -- I mean, Warren something... No, I don't know his name!"
amy, Jeff --
jeff,"No -- he kidnapped my wife, he's locked in a barn... Jeffrey Taylor. If you contact the police in --"
amy, Jeff!
jeff,Amy?!
jeff,C'mon!
yard, Amy and Jeff run for the Ford F100 utility truck -- an aging blue-collar workhorse equipped with side-mounted toolboxes and a lumber rack bearing a ladder.
amy,"Jeff, go!    Go!"
highway," The FORD PEELS OUT of the driveway and joins the road, spewing exhaust. It's an old vehicle that doesn't maneuver well."
amy,Can't this thing go any faster?!
jeff,What the fuck?!
firebird," kicking up a cloud of dust as it pulls alongside the Ford on the right-hand shoulder.  The driver, Billy, is levelling a shotgun through the window."
jeff,Get down!
cadillac deville," pulling even with them on Jeff's side. The drive, Al, leers as he spins the wheel and creases the Ford -- CRUNCH!"
jeff, raises the PISTOL and FIRES!
highway, The Ford is sandwiched between the Cadillac and Firebird as they race down the highway with the Peterbilt in the rear.
amy,Jeff!
jeff,It's glass!   Use the rifle!
billy," grins as the SHOT WHISTLES past harmlessly. He reloads the SHOTGUN, snaps it shut and RETURNS FIRE -- BLAM!"
billy,Sonofabitch!
highway," The Firebird hits a mound of earth, flies through the air and lands with a CRASH!"
in peterbilt," Red sees the crash, scowling. He presses the gas and pulls closer, taking Billy's place alongside the Ford."
amy,Look out!
on peterbilt, a STRAY BULLET SLICES the hydraulic brake line running to the trailer. The HOSE HISSES and whips through the air!
red,Sonofabitch --
highway," The Peterbilt descends the grade, letting out a RAPID- FIRE BLAT of BACKFIRES. It's gaining speed, bearing down on the Ford."
jeff,Hang on!
in peterbilt," Red struggles to stay in control. Every time he applies the brakes, the unchecked trailer jars the cab forward.  The Peterbilt races into the curve.  Red has no choice. He has to pump the brakes and risk jackknifing or the truck will fly off the road altogether.  He hits the brakes!"
highway," The huge TRUCK SCREECHES on the asphalt, tires smoking, cab and trailer folding at right angles!  Then, unexpectedly, the trailer disconnects from the cab!"
peterbilt," blasts into the rear of the Ford, jarring it forward with a CRUNCH of METAL and taillights!"
jeff, slams against the wheel. Amy is thrown against the dashboard. The Ford is being propelled downhill by the Peterbilt.
highway," The two vehicles are now locked together, gaining speed as they hurtle down the grade."
jeff, jams the pistol through the rear pass-through window and FIRES at Red in the truck. BULLETS PING off the grille.  The GUN CLICKS empty.
in peterbilt," Red hits the brakes, but it's no use. The bumpers are meshed. The two vehicles plunge downhill, skidding sideways.  Up ahead, a concrete bridge spans a deep gorge."
jeff,You all right?
jeff,Yeah?
jeff,What is it?
amy, It's just... I can't get out...
jeff,What do you mean?
amy,I mean I can't get out!
jeff,"C'mon, Amy, push!"
jeff,"Push, goddammit!"
peterbilt, creeps toward the Ford. The truck's grille is smashed. One wheel RIM SCRAPES the asphalt. It gains speed.
amy, Jeff!
in ford, Jeff and Amy are thrown forward by the impact. The Peterbilt's ENGINE ROARS. It's pushing them over the edge!
in peterbilt, Red's eyes burn as he presses the accelerator and forces the pickup farther through the broken railing.
ford, lurches through the widening gap in the railing. Concrete sails into the canyon. The front tires hang over the void.
amy, Jeff?
on bridge," Jeff runs to the Peterbilt and jumps on the driver's side running board, grasping the door handle.  Red heaves the door open suddenly. It strikes Jeff's head with a crack! He falls backward to the ground."
red,You think you can come into my life and fuck with me? Nobody fucks with me!
on bridge," The truck is no longer hitting the Ford squarely. Instead, the Peterbilt's right front tire is riding up and over the cargo bed, crushing the left side of the Ford under its massive weight."
in peterbilt," Red has both hands around Jeff's windpipe.    He glances up for a second, reacts, but it's too late."
on bridge," The Peterbilt is surging up the driver's side of the Ford, using the pickup like a ramp!"
in ford, Amy screams as the left side of the cab is flattened under the Peterbilt's weight!
on bridge," For an instant, the Peterbilt's front tires seem to hang in the air... then the truck is falling!"
red,You think you can fuck with me?!
on bridge, The iron REBAR GROANS. It's beginning to give way under the weight of the truck. The truck slips slightly.
on peterbilt," Jeff clings to the handle. He reaches for the passenger side door handle, working his way up toward the bridge."
rebar, gives away once more and --
jeff," scales the cab, finding more handholds.   He climbs past the passenger door.  Behind him, Red is working his way higher in the same manner. He grabs Jeff's foot, trying to pull him off the cab.  Jeff kicks free and climbs past the sleeping compartment. Red grabs the door handle. Jeff boots the door release button.  The passenger door flies open!  Red falls away as the door opens. He's clinging to the open passenger door, suspended over the gorge."
amy,Oh God... Jeff...
jeff,"C'mon, Amy, it's all you now... you can do it..."
peterbilt, comes free from the rebar!
amy, takes hold of Jeff's hand.
peterbilt, plummets into the canyon!
red, screams!
peterbilt, seems to fall forever... before landing with a huge EXPLOSION!
amy,"Don't let me go, Jeff..."
jeff,"I won't, baby... I won't ever let you go..."
jeff,How's the sheriff?
fbi agent,"Out of surgery. It looks like he's gonna make it. As for the wife and kid, she's not talking, he's being turned over to Protective Services."
fbi agent,We've got I.D. on the dead suspects. Turns out they were all licensed truckers. One of 'em had a rap for check kiting. Otherwise they could've been model citizens.
jeff,What about the leader?
fbi agent,"Same thing. His real name's Warren Claney. Three speeding tickets in five years -- apart from that, he's clean as a whistle."
amy, How could they do it? How could they treat it like a... business?
fbi, C'mon -- let's get you folks out of here before things really get hairy.
amy,Promise me one thing...
jeff,Name it.
amy,Next time... we fly.
