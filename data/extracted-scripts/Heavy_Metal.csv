Speaker,Dialogue
screenplay by, Dan Goldberg  and  Len Blum
the van," AUSTIN shuts the van's rear doors, and carries the two metal boxes into the house.  The titles stop rolling as we;"
austin,  Hmmmm ....
austin,  Uh - oh ....
space," With an explosion that rocks the universe, a huge chunk rips out of the green planet and shoots off into space, leaving thousands of glowing particles in its wake."
austin," Not noticing the silent image on the holograph, he quickly repairs the sparkling connection and returns to his other adjustments."
a forest," From the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead, dropping balls.  We watch as it moves away and disappears beyond a far-off mountain range.  The forest rumbles as the planetoid crashes in the distance.  The camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful girl approaches, picking mushrooms."
the outlands," Flying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors, where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub-bush and weeds.  The camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant mountains where the huge planetoid fell.  Finally, from high above the foothills, we begin to come down.  In the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are moving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high in the mountaintops.  Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble."
the mountains," A strange, green, foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountains toward the barbarians."
elder, Silence!
elder," We are not a race of warriors. We are statesmen, and scientists. From our very beginning it was ordained that the warrior-race of Taarak the Defender would aid us in times of need. This was the Pact!"
elder, One of Taarak's blood can do much.
boy, Elder!  They are at the walls!
elder," It is Taarna, of the blood of Taarak the Defender - the last of the race.  And must be summoned as my forefathers summoned Taarak himself - from within!"
elder, A Taarakian has no choice.  They must answer.  It is in their blood.
boy, They are in the halls!  They are coming!!
elder, We will summon the Defender together.
elder,  Taarna ... Taarna ...
the door," As the boy begins to bar the door, it bursts open, flinging him aside.  Standing in the doorway, surrounded by his men, is the BARBARIAN LEADER.  With a laugh, he raises a Medieval-looking multiple cross-bow and fires a burst of arrows into the boy's chest, as the crazed troops rush in around him.  The chanting continues as we;"
the outlands," We look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure breaking the barren uniformity of the land.  As the Council's distant chanting fades out, all is quiet.  Suddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wings and a huge rush of air.  Just above our heads, TAARNA THE DEFENDER comes flying in, sitting proudly in the saddle of a giant crimson bird."
taarna's face," She is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing behind her in the wind.  Below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror, chased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature.  Spurring her bird forward, TAARNA sweeps down over the ugly beast and lassoes it.  She then hoists the creature up into the air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged rock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly.  Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts.  As she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion on a chain around his neck."
humanoid, I owe you my life.  Let me repay you ...
austin grimaldi," He is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine. As the camera pulls closer, we see that AUSTIN is reaching deep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orange diode in place with an odd-style soldering iron.  The connection breaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the machine and start smoking and sputtering.  As the smoke grows thicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly."
austin, Dammit!
bombardier,  Where the hell are we?
navigator," We're there Stepek, right on target ... Rabual dead ahead!"
bombardier," Gee!  Thanks for telling me, Holden.  I thought it was Cleveland."
the ground," Ackack guns blast shells skyward.  The gun blasts light up the palm tree background, causing momentary silhouettes."
bombardier," For Christ sake, hold her steady!"
the bellygunner, He can be seen from outside the plane as the shell flashes light up his turret.
bellygunner," Quit yer bitching Stepek, just drop 'em and let's get outta here!"
bombardier," Keep your shirts on guys, tonight I'm gonna hit something.  Left two degrees ... steady ... steady ..."
the bellygunner," The flak is severe, with electric blue flashes lighting up the fuselage interior."
bellygunner," Hey kid, how ya doing back there?"
the tailgunner," Tailgunner momentarily lit with a shell burst, he's scared shitless.  He looks nervously back behind the aircraft at the flak puffs behind the tail."
tailgunner," Gulp, ah ... I'm ah ... okay ... I think."
pilot,"  Button it up, we're almost there."
the bombardier," He is crouched over his bomb-sights, concentrating."
navigator,"  C'mon Stepek, there's the whole island of Rabaul down there, you can't miss!"
bombardier, Screw you ...
pilot, We took a hit ...
pilot, Shit.  Elkhorn just bought it.
bellygunner,"  We took one back here too. C'mon Stepek, blast 'em!"
bombardier,  Steady ... steady ... bombs away! Let's get the hell outta here!
the ground," We hear the shriek of descending bombs.  The explosions walk across the airfield, and in the light of the explosions we see devastation.  The last bomb hits a fuel dump, causing an enormous ball of fire."
bombardier,  Yahoo!  Bullseye!
pilot,"  Nice shooting Stepek, how are the rest of you guys?"
flight engineer,  Flight Engineer okay.
radio operator,  Radio okay.
navigator,  Navigator check.
bellygunner,  Belly okay.
tailgunner,  Ah ... tail okay ...
pilot, Bellson ... Lewis?
pilot," Kid, check the waist positions, see if they're okay."
tailgunner," Yeah ... will do, skipper."
pilot,  Let's go home.
crew,  Cheers and whoops.
tailgunner,"  Skipper, Bellson and Lewis are both dead."
pilot, Dammit!
bombardier,"  Well kid, now you got a real bombing mission under your belt."
the bombardier, He removes his oxygen mask and takes a long swig from a bottle.
bellygunner,"  Are ya sure he's dead, Skipper?"
pilot, He's dead.
bombardier,"  Oh I put my finger in a woodpecker's hole and the woodpecker said God bless my soul; take it out, take it out, take it out, remove it ..."
tailgunner,"  Hey Stepek, just shut up, okay?"
bombardier," Up yours kid, wassa matter, you don't like my voice?"
navigator,  Something's wrong!
the navigator, He is frantically tapping the compass.
pilot,"  You got a problem, Holden?"
bombardier,"  Naw, the kid's the one with the problem.  He don't like my voice!"
pilot,"  Button it up Stepek.  What's the problem, Holden?"
navigator," I must have a malfunction, my compass says we're heading north!"
pilot, He looks at his compass.
pilot, Mine says east.
navigator,"  Hey, can you guys see the rest of the squadron?"
bellygunner,"  Negative, there's too much cloud."
the cockpit," The dead co-pilot's pale face is momentarily electric blue, lit by the lightning flash.  We pan past him to the compass in the instrument panel.  It is spinning madly."
pilot, What the hell ...
pilot," Hey Holden, now my compass has gone crazy.  It's spinning like a son of a bitch!"
navigator,"  Mine too, we must have hit a magnetic field or something !!"
pilot,"  Christ, now they're all doing it!!"
bombardier,  You guys quit talking business? I'm trying to sing here!  Oh I put my finger in a woodpecker's ...
pilot,"  Can it Stepek, we got real problems."
bellygunner, Jesus!  Look at that!!
pilot,  Look at what ... look at what!!?
bellygunner," It's out there, just look at it ..."
pilot,"  For Christ sake, give us a position!"
bellygunner," It's about four o'clock, just below ... Holy Shit, it's coming right at us!"
pilot's pov, He has to push the dead co-pilot back to peer out the broken starboard window ... the number three prop is bent and windmilling wildly.  It has a strange green luminescence about it ... the whole machine shakes.
pilot, Damn.
pilot," We lost the goddamned prop ... Did it do any damage?  Kid, check the tail."
pilot, Come in kid ... kid are you okay?
pilot, Travis; go check the back.
bellygunner,"  Will do, skipper."
inside hatch, TRAVIS' turret opens and TRAVIS pulls himself up into the fuselage.
the pilot, The gauges are now settled except for the oil pressure to No. 2 engine.  The pressure drops.  The engine heat gauge climbs rapidly.  A red warning light begins to flash.
pilot,"  Goddamn it, now what?"
pilot," Gremlins!  Jesus, I must be getting tired."
the bellygunner," He looks in to the kid's reargun compartment.  All that is left of him is a tattered skeleton.  TRAVIS turns, horror frozen on his face.  Quick as a flash, from seemingly nowhere, something flies at him and grabs his throat.  The mask on his face falls off, and we get a split second look of abject horror as he falls out of frame."
pilot,"  Travis, what's goin' on back there?"
travis," His eyes are open but he is obviously dead.  Through his helmet headphone, we hear his name."
pilot," Holden, how far to base?"
navigator,"  Skip, with everything screwed up here, I'd, I'd guess about two hundred miles."
pilot," For Christ's sake, find us a place I can put her down!"
navigator," It's all ocean down there, skip!"
pilot," Mack, can you get us a radio fix?"
radio operator," Negative skip, too much interference."
the pilot, He is fighting the controls.
pilot, Shit!  I've gotta put her down!
bombardier, Hey Holden ... ya old stuff shirt ... ya wanna snort?
pilot,"  For God sakes Stepek, shut up!"
bombardier," Oh my God, there's ... there's ... ahh ... keep away ... keep away ... "
navigator,"  Stepek, you stupid sonovabitch, will you lay off the booze, you've got the D.T.'s ..."
stepek," He is losing his grip with one hand, but still desperately clinging on to a bunch of cables with the other.  Suddenly an ugly pincer cuts the cables and STEPEK is gone ... out into the night."
the plane," Suddenly the No. 2 engine begins to backfire, blasting back large gobs of orange flame.  The oil, heat and manifold gauges are off the dial and red lights frantically flash.  Desperately the PILOT looks out of the window.  Pieces begin flying off the engine.  The cowling disintegrates revealing the bare engine beneath.  Small figures are frantically busy ripping the engine to pieces."
the pilot, He is scared.
pilot," Holden, for God's sake get up here on the double."
navigator,"  What's the problem, skip?"
pilot, Just get up here!
navigator," What is it, skip?   JESUS H. CHRIST!"
pilot, Hold 'em off.  I'm taking her down.
the pilot," He is fighting the controls.  Creatures are now in the cockpit, plucking out the instruments.  The PILOT reaches to the throttle only to grab a creature that locks on to his gloved hand. Flying the plane with his good hand, he strikes and pummels at the attacking creatures with the other."
the pilot," He falls, terror-stricken, through space.  Finally his chute opens.  A slimy creature still clings to his gloved hand.  He rips off the glove and throws it and the creature away."
pilot,  Jesus H. Christ!
the island," The approaching smoking plane bellies onto the sea, bounces, then skims along the wave tops, careening up onto the beach, where it twists around crazily before coming to a lopsided stop.  The machine faces us head-on and we see a glow coming from what's left of No. 3 engine. The camera zooms in rapidly"
the pilot," He has landed, and is undoing his parachute harness.  He looks around incredulously.  The island is a junkyard - a veritable graveyard of aircrafts.  There are many aircrafts, both old wrecks and futuristic-looking ones lying everywhere.  Skeletal corpses are still left in some of the wrecks.  The camera pans to the remains of one machine.  It is an old American Lockheed Electra.  It glints dull in the half light of dawn.  Painted on its side are two names; ""Amelia Earhart"" and ""Fred Noonan"".  The camera continues to move through this panorama of metallic junk until it stops on a long chrome rod sticking up out of a pile of scrap.  Tilting up to the sky we see the clouds part as two gargantuan metal arms emerge and descend down toward the junkpile.  The metal arms reach the chrome rod, grip it tightly, and begin to lift it up.  WWe follow as the cylinder is pulled higher and higher, finally coming to a stop in front of a giant eyeball.  The camera pulls back to reveal that the eyeball belongs to AUSTIN GRIMALDI, who carefully scrutinizes the orange diode held tightly in his needlenose pliers."
austin, Got it.
little girl," It's broken again, isn't it Daddy?"
little girl,  How come it's always breaking?
austin," I don't know, sweetheart.  Mmmmhmm."
little girl," When it's fixed, will you make more funny pictures for me?"
austin," Honey, why don't you go play with your toys and let Daddy finish his work, okay?  Mmmm ..."
little girl, Okay.
girl's bedroom," Entering, TAARNA sees the slimy silk-like cocoon on the bed. The basket of fruit still sits on the floor.  From within the webbing, the green ball is glowing brightly.  TAARNA looks at the parchment in her sack, then at the glow coming from the cocoon.  Cautiously, she approaches the cocoon, sword drawn.  Suddenly a hand from within the cocoon grabs the ball and shoots forward, ripping through the webbing and holding the ball up to TAARNA's face.  The hand belongs to a hideously ugly witch, who emerges from the cocoon, cackling through snake-like fangs."
witch," Behold!  The Sphere of Uluhtec! Look upon it, Taarna.  Look upon it with fear.  For in its glow lies the end of heaven - the beginning of hell.  Take it Taarna.  Feel death in your hands.  For death is upon you.  And as you perish ... so dies your race!"
witch,  Take it !!
space," The WITCH'S green ball zooms through space, as Earth appears in the distance.  Then another object comes into sight.  Getting closer we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no determinable nationality, soaring high above Earth.  The green meteorite passes, briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow.  The rocketplane banks sharply, then stabilizes.  Slowly the hatch-doors in its belly open up, revealing the underside of an automobile suspended in the open hatch.  Hydraulic metal arms emerge, lowering the automobile out from the belly of the cruising rocketplane.  We can see now that the car is a white, '59 Corvette convertible.  With a ""thunk"", the metal arms release the car, and as the rocketplane blasts away, the Corvette begins its free-fall to Earth.  As the car falls gracefully through space, the driver plays with the wheel, causing the Corvette to bank smoothly one way, then the other.  Once his direction is stable, the driver clicks on the car radio and adjusts it through various channels, until he settles on one.  With the music playing, the car falls closer and closer to Earth, entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the atmosphere.  In the heat of entry the vehicle's paint starts burning up.  As he heads down over a deserted area, the driver begins his approach.  Touching down at breakneck speed, the smoking Corvette bounces violently, every part straining at the repeated impact.  The driver's face is expressionless as he jams the car into high gear and floors it, spinning the wheels in an attempt to translate downward momentum into forward motion.  Then he pops his drag chute to help slow down.  TThis accomplished, the expressionless driver releases the chute, and speeds off down the road in a cloud of dust."
female reporter,"  Doctor Anrak, six more mutants were sighted in Arizona this morning.  Do you still say this has nothing to do with the green radiation from space."
fat politician," ... well what I wanna know is, what's the Army doing about this? Hell!  My constiuents are turning green!  They're growing arms on their backs.  There's something or someone up there in space and the voters have a right to know about it!"
general," Senator, we have no proof that these mutations are the result of interference from outer space.  In fact, Doctor Anrak has just come in, so let's hear what he has to say ... Doctor?"
doctor," First of all, there is no cause for alarm.  As for the theories of interference by alien beings, it is my firm opinion that we on Earth are the only intelligent, technically advanced civilization present in the universe."
doctor, ... and whatever is causing these mutations is not from outer space. it's more likely just an isolated biological pheno ... pheno ... ph ... ph ... ph ...
doctor, Pretty ... pretty ... p ... p ...
doctor, Aaarrgghh!
secretary, Eeeeeek!
robot,"  Oh, nice job.  How am I supposed to fix this guy?  He's fucked."
zeke,  I guess we turned it up a little too high.
edsel,"  Sorry, man."
robot, You're sorry?  What about me? I've gotta put this asshole back together.
gloria,   Where am I?
robot,"  Hey, who's the chick?"
gloria, Well look at my clothes! Who's gonna pay for the dry cleaning?  And where am I? I demand that you return me to my office immediately.
robot, Too late - molecular instability zone around spacecraft. You cannot leave.
gloria,  What?!  Is he kidding?
zeke, Uh ...
zeke, ... oh yeah.  Instability zone. You're stuck here.
gloria,  But I have to be at my parents for dinner tonight.  And my gynecologist appointment is on Wednesday.
robot," Not anymore.  Would you, ah, like a drink?  You'll feel better after a glass of fresh blo-aak."
gloria,  Do you have any diet soda?
edsel,"  Ah, typical robot.  The first Earth-chick we see in ten years, and he's gotta make a play for her."
zeke," Hey, do we have any of that Plutonian Nyborg left?"
edsel," Uh, yeah.  Just one bag.  Uh, it's in the transmitter compartment."
zeke," Uh, thanks man."
zeke,  Oh great.  Think this is enough?
edsel,  Uhh ... nah.  Go for broke.
zeke," Good thinking, man."
edsel,"  Oh, wow ... good Nyborg!"
gloria,  That was incredible.  I've never felt anything like it.
robot, Oh great.  I have been programmed to be fully proficient in sexual activities. Do you want to go steady?
gloria," Gee, I don't know.  I already have a boyfriend."
robot," Ah, what he does not know will not hurt him."
control console," ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, staring wide-eyed out into space.  They are obviously stoned.  Suddenly a bell rings and the communicator screen lights up.  A serious officer's face appears on it."
zeke," Whaddyawant, man?"
edsel,  You gotta use the microphone.
zeke, Oh yeah.  Whaddyawant man?
officer," Now listen, idiot.  Do I have to tell you eight hundred times?  You don't call me ""man""!  You call me ""Com-Op Officer Blix"". Now is that perfectly clear?"
zeke,"  Yeah, sure.  Whaddyawant, man?"
officer,  You are to return immediately to the Mother Ship and pick up a humanoid civilian.  Your orders are to escort him to the Interplanetary Tribunal Courtroom so that he can testify at the trial of Lincoln Sternn.  And make it snappy!
edsel, Wow!  They finally got Sternn.
zeke," It's about time.  Hang on, man. Here we go."
space, The round spaceship blasts forward at ten times the speed of light.
edsel,  You okay to land this thing?
zeke," No problem, man."
edsel,"  I think you're goin' a little high, man."
zeke,"  It's okay, man.  If there's one thing I know, it's how to drive when I'm stoned.  It's like, you know your perspective's fucked, so you just gotta let your hands work the controls as if you're straight."
edsel,"  Oh, wow, good landing, man."
zeke,  Thanks.
regolian guard,"  This man is to be delivered to the, clik, Interplanetary Tribunal, Courtroom #3, clik, Galaxy versus Lincoln Sternn. Thenk yew.  Clik."
fiste,"  Ah, hello."
edsel,"  Umm, you're gonna testify at Sternn's trial?"
zeke," They gotta give him at least, like, life."
fiste, Lincoln Sternn is a kind and honourable man.  He will be freed.
edsel,"  Y'know, I wish they'd clean this place up, man."
zeke,  Yeah.  It's like pig city out here.
edsel,  Yeah.
robot's bedroom, GLORIA is getting dressed as the ROBOT re-charges his energy- paks.
robot, ... but I don't understand.  We laugh together.  We care for each other.  We have highly proficient sex.  Why can't we get married?
gloria," Look, we're different, okay?  Let's leave it at that."
control room," The hatch opens, and GLORIA and the ROBOT walk through, still talking."
gloria, ... but mixed marriages just don't work.  What if you get tired of me and run off with a vibrator or something?
control console," ZEKE and EDSEL are sitting at the controls, driving carefully. FISTE, carrying the green ball, comes up and sits down beside them."
zeke," There it is, man.  I'm gonna hang a louie here."
edsel,"  Yeah, well it won't be long now.  Are you sure you're gonna testify for Sternn."
gloria," ... alright, alright.  I'll marry you - but on one condition ... I want a Jewish wedding."
robot, A Jewish wedding!?!!!  But this is space.  95% of the population are robots.
gloria," Well, find me a robot-rabbi!"
robot," Okay, okay!"
edsel," I give them six months, man."
zeke, He doesn't even look Jewish!
prosecutor, Are you Captain Lincoln F. Sternn?
sternn, I am.
prosecutor, Lincoln Sternn - you stand here accused of twelve counts of murder in the first degree  ... fourteen counts of armed theft of Federation property ...
the gallery," The hostile humanoid and alien faces all stare at STERNN with hateful, accusing eyes."
prosecutor,  ... twenty-two counts of piracy in high space ... eighteen counts of fraud ...
sternn's lawyer," Mopping his brow, he looks nervously over to STERNN."
prosecutor,"  ... thirty-seven counts of rape, and one moving violation.  How do you plead?"
captain sternn," Smiling to himself, he nods, then gets serious."
sternn, Not guilty!
lawyer,  Not guilty?!?  Are you nuts?!?
sternn,"  It's okay, Charlie.  I got an angle."
judge,  Call the first witness!
lawyer,  But the Prosecutor's gotcha cold! Yer as guilty as a cat in a goldfish bowl.
prosecutor, The Prosecution calls Hanover Fiste.
lawyer,  Lissen Sternn ... change the plea to guilty.  Throw yerself on the mercy of the court.
sternn," I told you, Charlie.  I got an angle."
lawyer, But the most we can hope for is to get ya buried in secrecy so yer grave don't get violated!  Plead guilty!
sternn," Shut up, Charlie.  I got an angle."
lawyer, What angle?
sternn,  Him!
prosecutor, State your name for the record.
fiste,  I am Hanover Fiste.
sternn,  I promised him thirty-five thousand zuleks to testify on my behalf.
prosecutor," You know the defendant,  Captain Sternn?"
fiste," Yes, I know Captain Sternn.  And never did there live a kinder, more generous man.  He is an overflowing cup, filled with the very cream of human goodness ..."
sternn,  See?
fiste," ... in all the time I've known him, he's never done anything immoral ...  unless maybe the Pre-Schooler's Prostitute ring ..."
fiste," He's nothin' but a low-down, double-dealin', back-stabbin', larcenous, perverted worm!!"
fiste, Hangin's too good for him!!
fiste, Burnin's too good for him!!
sternn, Hanover ...
fiste, He should be torn into little bitsy pieces and buried alive!!!
sternn, Hanover ...
fiste, I'll kill him!
fiste, KII - ILLL!!!
sternn,"  H-h-hey, Hanover ... n-now take it easy, Hanover, I'm sure we can talk this ov ..."
sternn," Running down a hallway, STERNN passes a group of Regolian cops, who raise their weapons in an attempt to block the rampaging FISTE."
sternn," He races through a metallic hallway, and ducks into a boiler room, then down a long dark tunnel.  At the end of the tunnel, STERNN comes to a dead-end, and stops to rest."
sternn," Oh, this looks good."
fiste, 
sternn," Oh, duck under here ..."
fiste, I'll get you!!
sternn," I think I'll turn here!  Come on feet, don't fail me now!"
fiste, Sternn!!!
sternn," Uh oh ...  Ah, gasp, ah whew, lost him!"
fiste, STERNN!!
sternn," Okay, Hanover, you've had this coming!"
sternn," Let's see, thirty-three, thirty- four, thirty-five thousand zuleks. Thanks Hanover."
fiste,"  S'nothin, boss."
sternn, And Hanover ...
fiste, Yes?
sternn, Goodbye.
the outlands," All is quiet across this vast expanse of rusted pipes and barren desert.  The silence is broken by a whistling sound which gets louder and louder.  Then, thud!  A green ball lands in the dirt in front of us.  Fluttering down around it are HANOVER FISTE'S tattered clothes.  Then the burnt ashes of Hanover's body land in a small pile beside his clothes.  Panning up we see TAARNA flying on her bird in the distance."
taarna," She swoops down and flies through a maze of rusting pipes and cables which look like the ramnants of an ancient power station. Then she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the rotting floor, and enters a magnificent  secret hideaway cut deep into the rock."
taarak,"  To defend - this is the Pact. but when life loses its value, and it taken for nought, then the Pact is ... to avenge!!"
the sky," From over our heads, TAARNA comes soaring past, her armour gleaming in the rays of the setting sun.  Below her, she sees a metallic holiday-town filled with barbarian soldiers. Drunken blue men fight in the streets, strange animals run around loose, and dead or drunken bodies lie in the gutters.  Looking down, amidst the melee, she sees three winged creatures tied up in front of a bar.  The camera zooms in on one of the creature's saddlebags.  It has a silver medallion set into the leather, identical to the one which TAARNA pried from the Elder's fingers."
taarna's hand," It slowly moves down to her sword, and unclips the safety strap.  CUT BACK TO"
bartender, Beyond the oasis.
the bartender," His eyes start to turn green.  The camera gets closer and closer to his glowing eyes, until the green glow turns into the image of a ball, lying in the ground, in AUSTIN'S holograph."
austin," AUSTIN is crouched over the machine turning several knobs, trying to make the ball move.  Nothing happens."
austin,  Hmmm ... must be jammed.
austin, Where'd it go?
the hands," As the hands cradle the green ball, the camera pulls back to reveal a skinny, unco-ordinated boy wearing thick eyeglasses, carrying the sphere across his backyard.  This is DAN."
dan,"  It all started when I found the green meteorite.  I read in Farraday's ""Life of the Planets"" that smaller ones like this are supposed to burn up when they enter the atmosphere, but for some reason this one didn't ..."
dan,"  ... so I brought it up to my room, stuck it in my rock collection and forgot about it.  I was experimenting with natural electricity ..."
dan,"  ... and with the storm warnings up, I figured maybe tonight I'd hit the jackpot.  All I needed was a little juice."
the storm," Crackling from the sky, a bolt of lightning strikes the television antenna and surges along the wires into the attic."
dan, It works!
dan,  Oh Jesus!
the transformation, We float in darkness for a moment as black shapeless images zoom past.
dan,  I felt like I was nothing - just atoms floating in the darkness ...
dan,"  Then, a body started to re-form around me.  Only it wasn't my body - this one had muscles."
dan,"  It was a great body, but I wasn't too crazy about the face."
den,  Hmmm ... no hair.
priests,"  Uluhtec, Ulutec ..."
queen," By the powers of the glowing Loc-Nar placed in your idol's hand, I demand you come forth, Uluhtec!"
den, Hmmm ... big!
dan,  There was no way I was gonna walk around this place with my dork hangin' out!
dan,  Wow!  This looked like something right out of the Ten Commandments.
queen, Grant me your strength in return for a living mortal sacrifice!  It has been ordained.  Come forth Uluhtec! I demand it!
dan,  What'd they do that for?
dan,"  Normally, I'd be dead by now.  I kept thinking I was going to run out of air, but my new body worked great.  I just hoped her body was working as good as mine."
girl, Thank you.
dan,  She had the most beautiful eyes. I wanted to make some conversation but I found my new self asking the same old stupid questions.
den, Are you from around here?
girl," Well, you may not believe this, but I'm from another world - from a place called Earth."
den, Earth?  I too am from Earth. How did you get here?
girl," My name is Katherine Wells, and I'm from the British colony of Gibraltar.  Time makes no diff- erence here, but there it was the summer of 1892.  It was evening - I'd gone for a walk on the cliffs when suddenly a sphere fell from the sky.  Following its glow, I came to a shining gate made out of light.  Unable to resist, I stepped through it and awoke in this world.  There I was thin and weakly, fit only to stay indoors.  ... more fully a woman."
dan,  You're not kidding.
den, Even my fingers seem to hold great strength.
katherine," You saved my life.  I have no reward to give you, but if any part of me pleases your senses - I would give it willingly."
dan,"  Wow!  This was great!  There was no way I'd get a chick like this back on Earth.  I mean, look at her!!"
dan,  There was only one problem ...
dan,"(V.O.  I don't know who these jerks were, but they sure picked a bad time to show up ..."
dan,"  They split us up and took me to this weird castle-type place. I wanted to find out where they'd taken Katherine, but none of these guys seemed to speak English."
ard," They tell me you are Den of Earth, the one who dared to steal the female sacrifice from the Queen."
dan,  This guy was a shrimp so I figured I'd play it tough.
den, Where is the girl?
ard, I am Ard - supreme leader of the revolution and the next ruler of the world.
den,  The girl!!
ard," Well, aren't we fierce? If you are truly as tough as you seem, then you will serve me well.  But first, a test. Guards!  Castrate him!"
dan,  Uh oh.
dan,  Boy!  I was pretty good at this stuff.
ard, Excellent.  You are worthy to serve me.
den,  Give me the girl or die.
ard,"  Well, if I have a choice, I'll take death."
den, So be it.
ard, Ha ha ha!  You'll have to do better than that.
dan,  I could see why they made this guy their leader.
ard,  ... but if you're really interested in the girl; I've had her encased in glass.
den, She's dead.
ard," Actually no.  She's sleeping, but only I can awaken her."
den, What do you want of me?
ard, I want you to steal the sacred Loc-Nar.
den, What is this Loc-Nar?
ard," The Queen's glowing sphere, you fool.  The sacrifice to Uluhtec can only be performed by the possessor of the sacret Loc-Nar.  Norl!"
ard,"  This is Norl, my bravest warrior. You will go with him to the Queen's castle and steal the Loc-Nar.  Then I will give you the girl."
den, And if I refuse?
ard," If you refuse, you die, she dies, everybody dies."
dan,  Sounded reasonable to me.
norl,  Ssh.  Guard post ahead.  We must go underground.
dan,"  This guy Norl seemed to know what he was doing.  And, for a gorilla, his English wasn't half bad."
underground tunnel," The group, carrying torches, moves along the dark tunnel.  They pass a bubble-window with shark-faced eels swimming on the other side."
norl,  We're underneath the castle moat.
den,  What are they saying?
norl, They talk of the savage beast who prowls these catacombs with a fierce hunger and sharp teeth ...  six inches long.
norl, Sorry ...  ... sixteen inches long.
norl,"  Now we separate.  You and Korg take this door into the Queen's quarters.    The rest of us will move through the walls and enter her chamber from the other side. Whoever gets the Loc-Nar first will return it to Ard.  Good luck, Den."
dark room," DEN and KORG silently enter.  Across the dark room, the glow of the green ball casts a pale light."
korg,  Loc-Nar.
dan,  Wow!  It was just like the ball I dug up in my back yard.
dan,"  As I saw the Loc-Nar's glow I had this real funny feeling.  All by themselves, my hands reached forward to touch it.  But the Loc-Nar moved out of the way. Instead, my hands felt something else - warm flesh.  Then the lights came on."
dan,  Talk about embarassing!
queen,  Kill them.
captain," Can I slit his throat, your Majesty?"
queen," Yes, slit his throat."
captain," Thank you, your Majesty."
queen,"  Stop!  I have, ah, something better in mind."
captain," Look, she's the Queen.  She can do whatever she wants."
queen," If you please me, I may let you live."
dan,  Uh oh.
den, What must I do?
queen, Satisfy my appetites.
dan,"  Wow!  Eighteen years of nuthin' and now, twice in one day.  What a place!"
queen, Come with me.
den, Mmmm.
queen,"  The rising moon climaxes our love, Den.  Is is a sign, a new beginning."
den," Yes, a sign."
dan,  I had no idea what she was talking about.
queen,"  Neverwhere is a troubled land, but together we could calm it. We could rule side by side. Your strength has brought great peace to my restless body.  It could bring great peace to all the troubled people of this land."
dan,"  I knew I was good, but I didn't know I was that good."
captain, Your Majesty!  The Loc-Nar is missing - stolen!
queen,  Fiend!  You make love to me while your accomplices steal the magic sphere!  Guards!  Take him!
queen,  Hold him still!  I will kill him myself!
dan,"  Boy, was she pissed off!"
the queen, She is livid.
queen, Prepare the flying lizards. I want his head!
ard," By the power of the magic Loc-Nar placed in your idol's hands, I command you - come forth Uluhtec!"
den,  Katherine!
soldier,"  There he is, your Majesty!"
queen,  The Loc-Nar!
queen,  Faster!  To the pyramid!
ard," Here is your sacrifice, Uluhtec. Now, give me your power!  Throw her in."
den, Katherine!
katherine, Den!
ard, No!  You'll ruin everything!
ard,  Kill them!  Kill them both!
queen, The Loc-Nar is mine!
ard,  Stupid bitch!  Get away from me!
den," Holding KATHERINE in one arm, DEN smashes a nearby soldier and grabs the beast's spear.  With the battle raging all around him, DEN looks up at the sky."
the sky," Lightning crackles, illuminating the night with electricity."
den," DEN reaches down, picks up the long chain that was wrapped around the glass case and attaches one end to his spear.  He kicks the other end into the raging water, then heaves the spear with all his might into the head of the stone idol.  In the same instant, a bolt of lightning fires down from the sky, striking the idol full force.  The lightning bolt travels through the spear and down the chain, into the water.  Suddenly, the electrical energy arcs across to join with the Loc-Nar.  Holding onto the Loc-Nar, ARD and the QUEEN begin to glow green, then de-materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp.  The troops stop fighting and look on in amazement, until all that remains is the glowing Loc-Nar, hanging in mid-air."
katherine,  Where did they go?
den, They are gone.  That is all that matters.
dan,"  They probably went back to Earth. Boy, will Mom be surprised."
katherine,  The Loc-Nar ... you could have the power of Uluhtec.  You could be ruler over all these people.
den,  Forget it.
katherine," Oh, but Den, with the Loc-Nar you could have returned to Earth."
den, I like it better here.
dan,"  On Earth, I'm nobody.  But here, I am DEN."
people," The people appears to be a band of aboriginal workmen, carrying futuristic laser-shovels over their shoulders.  They are led by a goateed archaeologist with an elaborate metal detector.  As he walks, his detector starts bleeping.  He points to a spot on the ground, and the natives start digging with their laser- shovels.  One of the workers finds something."
worker, Kuma!  Kuma!  Kuma!
harry,"  Yeah, New York, big deal.  Scum-centre of the world."
harry,"  ... and now they're talking about letting in low-lifes from other planets, too."
young man,  You free?
harry, Yeah.  Get in.  My name's Harry Canyon.  I drive a cab.  He flips a switch which unlocks the rear door.
outside cab," The young man climbs into the back seat and closes the door. Harry's yellow Checker cab pulls out into traffic.  The vehicle looks pretty normal except for some vaguely futuristic chrome panels cut into the sides, and thicker, deeper bumpers."
inside cab, Harry slides open the plexiglass shields separating him from his passenger.
harry," Where to, pal?"
young man, The U.N. Building.
harry, The U.N. Building.  What a joke. Used to be a nice place until they turned it into low rent housing. Now it's a dump.  I wouldn't live there if you paid me.
young man," Okay sucker, hand over your cash, now!"
harry,  This city is really going to the dogs.
harry,  Stupid asshole.  Nobody touches me unless I want 'em to.
girl, Father!
professor, Run!
rudnick,  He's dead.  Get the girl!
girl,"  Help me, please!!"
harry,"  Normally my rule is ""Don't get involved"", but something about this dame got to me."
girl,  The Loc-Nar ... they wanted it ... but my father wouldn't tell them ... now I'm the only one ...
harry, HARRY   Relax sister.  There's a cop station up here.  You can ...
harry,  Just what I needed ... guess I'm a sucker for a pretty face.
police station," The police station is an all-metal building with no windows. A plaque on thr front reads ""N.Y. POLICE - 52nd DIVISION"".  Harry's cab pulls up.  He gets out, carries the unconscious GIRL up to the front door, and pushes a buzzer."
voice,  Police.  Whaddya want?
harry, I wanna report a murder.
voice,  So what else is new?
harry, You gonna let me in or what?
desk sergeant,"  Before you go any further pal, I gotta tell you, it's cash up front.  A thousand bucks a day for a full investigation. Another thousand if the assailant is caught. Got it?"
harry, Yeah thanks ...
harry,... for nuthin'!
desk sergeant,  You think you can do better? Join one of the vigilante groups. There's a list of 'em outside.
green alien, I tell you I'm an American citizen. I just lost my papers.
cop,  Goddamn illegal aliens.
harry,"  So here I was, stuck with this beautiful girl.  I knew she was gonna be nuthin' but trouble ..."
harry,"  ... but I didn't feel right just leaving her for the sickos.  I dunno, maybe I'm gettin' sentimental or something ..."
girl, Where am I?
harry, My place ...
girl,  They'd have killed me if it wasn't for you.
harry, What'd they want to snuff you for?
