note,"Edge City, also the name of the film's production company, is a recurring theme in Tom Wolfe's ""Electric Kool-Ade Acid Test""."
otto,"Mother, father. Got anything to eat?"
reverend larry,Occasionally we get a letter from a viewer that says now the only reason Reverend Larry comes on your television set is because he wants your money. And do you know what? They're right! I do want your money. Because god wants your money. So I want you to go out and mortgage that home and sell that car and send me your money. You don't need that car. 
otto mom,Put it on a plate son you'll enjoy it more.
otto,I couldn't enjoy it any more mom MMM MMM MMM This is swell.
otto,Dad? Hey Dad?
otto dad,What is it son?
otto,Do you remember that you once told me along time ago. Well not too long ago but ummm. That you told me that you'd give me a thousand dollars to go to Europe if I finish school. Well you know something? You were right. About finishing school that's ah that's what I'd like to do. But umm I want to know if I could have the money first. Like now. [You know I really love you Dad I've always loved you. You too mom. What do you say?
otto dad,I don't have it anymore.
otto,What?]
otto mom,"You father gave all our extra money to the Reverend's telethon, Otto."
otto,Well what about me?
otto dad,"You're on the honor roll of the chariots of fire. Same as us, Otto. It was a gift. From all of us jointly."
otto mom,We're sending bibles to El Salvador.
otto,"So how much do I get paid, twenty-five buck a car."
bud,"Paid? You don't get paid. Are you kidding, you work on commission, that's better than getting paid."
bud,Most cars you rip are worth two or three hundred dollars. Fifty thousand dollar Porsche  might make ya five grand.
bud,"It helps if you dress like a detective, too. Detectives dress kind of square. People think this guy is a cop. They're going to think you're packing something. They don't fuck  with you so much."
otto,Are you?
bud,Am I what?
otto,Packin' something.
bud,Ha. Only an asshole  gets killed for a car. Guys who make it are the guys who get into their cars at anytime. Get in at three A.M. get up at four. That's why there ain't a repo man I know that don't take speed.
otto,Speed huh?
bud,I'll call you back!  Flippin general telephone.
bud,C'mon.  Otto and Bud in car in alley  
bud,Never broke into a car. Never hot-wired a car. Kid. I never broke into a trunk. I shall not cause harm to any vehicle nor the personal contents thereof. Nor through inaction let that vehicle or the personal contents thereof come to harm. That's what I call the repo code kid. Don't forget it etch it in your brain. Not many people got a code to live by anymore.
bud,Hey! Hey look at that. Look at those assholes  over there.
bud,Ordinary  people I hate 'em.
otto,Me too.
bud,What do you know? See an ordinary person spend his life avoiding tense situations. Repoman spends his life getting into tense situations. ! Lets go get a drink.
bud,Tense situations kid. Get into five or six of them a day and it don't mean shit  but that's when you got to watch your self. Here I'll handle it pal. Uh settle down.
bud,"Have a nice day. Or night. Night, day, it doesn't mean shit ."
duke,Wasn't that Otto?
debbi,Otto who?
duke,You gotta watch yourself.  Have a nice day . . . night.
bud,"This is what I call phase 2 ace. If the dealer don't have the keys, you call the truck. And it is a heartbreak to be sitting waiting for the truck and the giblet comes out and drives it away. Once you've got this baby on the hooks, she's all ours."
pakman,Oh no you don't. I'm nipping this in the bud right now. You are not going to take this car. I know my rights. There is absolutely no way you're going to take it.
bud,"Uh, are you miss Luann Pakman?"
pakman,Obviously not. I'm Arthur Pakman. Luann is my daughter. Now you're going to have to take this matter up with her.
bud,"Well don't think I haven't tried, sir, but she hasn't had the decency to call us in months. I mean, I've skipped trace this car all over town."
pakman,"Well, uh, Luann is sick. Now the damn car isn't working anyway, and I know, I know that's why she hasn't paid you."
bud,"Well, she could have called us? Look, all you've go to do is call my branch manager, I will abide with whatever he says."
bud,"What, and lose my job? The law requires that I stay right here until you call my branch manager."
pakman,That's the law?
bud,That's the law.
pakman,I'll be right back.
bud,There's going to be some bad shit  coming down one of these days kid.

lite,In that case you're going love this.
lite,I was into these dudes before anybody. Partied with them all the time. Asked me to be their manager. I called bullshit  on that. Managing a pop group hey that ain't no job for no man.
lite,You read that book I gave you?
otto,What book?
lite,Dioretix. Science of matter over mind.
otto,Unh uhg
lite,You'd better read it and quick. That book will change your life. Found it in a Maseratti in Beverly hills.
miller,"A lot of people don't realize what's really going on. They view life as a bunch of unconnected incidences and things. They don't realize that there's this like lattice of coincidence that lays on top of everything. I'll Give you an example, show you what I mean. Suppose you thinking about a plate of shrimp. Suddenly somebody will say like plate or shrimp or plate of shrimp out of the blue no explanation. No point in looking for one either. It's all part of a cosmic unconsciousness."
otto,"You eat a lot of acid Miller, back in the hippie days?"
miller,"I'll give you another instance. You know the way everybody's into weirdness right now. Books in all the supermarkets about Bermuda triangles, UFO's, how the Mayans invented television. That kind of thing."
otto,I don't read them books.
miller,"Well the way I see it it's exactly the same. There ain't no difference between a flying saucer and a time machine. People get so hung up on specifics. They miss out on seeing the whole thing. Take South America for example. In South America thousands of people go missing every year. Nobody knows where they go. They just like disappear. But if you think about it for a minute, you realize something. There had to be a time when there was no people. Right?"
otto,Yeah. I guess.
miller,Well where did all these people come from? hmmm? I'll tell you where. The future. Where did all these people disappear to? hmmm?
otto,The past?
miller,That's right and how did they get there?
otto,How the fuck  do I know?
miller,"Flying saucers. Which are really? Yeah you got it. Time machines. I think a lot about this kind of stuff. I do my best thinking on the bus. That how come I don't drive, see?"
otto,You don't even know how to drive.
miller,"I don't want to know how. I don't want to learn. See? The more you drive, the less intelligent you are."
bud,"You know I think I saw one of those things once. One of those UFOs. I mean it was really it was kind of kind of scary. I saw all these colored lights and, uh, sounds. I mean sounds and lights like I never heard before. I mean it was really weird."
otto,Bud.
bud,Yeah?
otto,Do you think all repo men follow the code?
bud,Of course. Well I mean you see a lot of fucked .
bud,I'm offering a thousands dollars for his Falcon. You know what that is Napoleon? It's a bribe.
napoleon,Who the hell is this? Napoleon? Who the fuck  are you calling?
bud,It's a grand if you show me where his car is Napoleon.
bud,Hello? Prick .
napoleon,Sixty-four Chevy Malibu. Twenty grand.
bud,Waiting!
napoleon,"We could buy ten of them for that, Marlene."
marlene,Think you can find it now?
napoleon,Now how come this junk is worth so much? What's in it? Drugs?
lagarto,Los Hermanos Rodriguez don't approve of drugs.
marlene,"Neither do I, but it's my birthday."
bud,"Don't care how long it takes, dildos . Repo man's got all night every night."
bud,twenty thousand dollars.
otto,"Hey Leila! All right, um, this is Otto. The guy who gave you a ride and stuff. I heard something about that car."
leila,Otto. Otto stop. You said you had something to tell me.
leila,Otto? Otto!
otto,Huh?
leila,What did you want to tell me?
otto,Oh! Take off your clothes.
leila,"I'm at work, Otto!"
otto,Oh yeah? Me too.
leila,Your work is different than mine.
otto,Says who?
leila,What are you doing.? Don't do that.
otto,"Heh, I guess that means no.]"
deadra,Leila? We have a cell meeting in two minutes time.
leila,Thanks Deadra. I'll be right there.
bud,See that motherfucker .
lite,No way you can do that on twenty grand man.
bud,The hell I can as long as you have good credit and my credit is spotless.
lite,"If I find the Malibu, you won't see me for dust, I'm going to move to Mendecino County, raise me a bumper crop of tomato plants."
bud,Credit is a sacred trust. It's what our free society is founded on. You think they give a damn about their bills in Russia? I said do you think they give a damn about their bills in Russia?
otto,They don't pay bills in Russia. It's all free.
bud,"All free? Free my ass, what are you a fucking  commie? Huh?"
otto,No I ain't no commie.
bud,Well you'd better not be I don't want any commies in my car. No Christians either.
kevin,I'll deal with you later. I've got a customer to attend to. You too.
kevin,Hi! I'm Kevin. Vacuum sir?
kevin,Need a vacuum sir?
kevin,"You don't want to eat from a machine. Look, there's a nice Del Taco across the street. They've got enchurritos and everything."
kevin,Lorna Doones? I love Lorna Doones.
kevin,Oh hey! You want me to check the trunk? Scuze me.
kevin,Hi! I'm Kevin!
napoleon,Hey buddy! How you doing? Huh? Hey don't you remember me? I was here yesterday. Heh. Listen I think I left a book of matches over in your office over there. You want to go and check for me huh?
kevin,Sure thing.
napoleon,Hey thanks a lot buddy.
kevin,Any thing for you babes.
napoleon,"All right, you're beautiful. I love you."
kevin,I'll be right back.  Lagarto gets in the Malibu and both cars drive off. Kevin returns from inside and sees both cars gone. Two other attendants sit at a table and also look; the attendant on the right is director Alex Cox.
kevin,"What??  Shot of car driving down freeway, passed by several motorcycles."
otto,It's really very simple Mrs. Parks. You don't want me to take your car and I don't want to take your car. Now I said to the boss I said ah Look! I do not want to repossess this ladys car.
otto,"Yeah, Yes I understand. My job is really on the line over this one. I could lose it right away."
otto,"That's terrific. Really terrific.  Mrs. Park's son and his fellow band members enter  MRS. PARKS Oh how was the rehearsal son?  MRS. PARKS' SON It was O.K. Who's this?  MRS. PARKS Oh this is Mr. Otto. He's from the finance company. He's been telling me that he isn't going to take the car this time, even though he could."
otto,"Well, uh, gotta get going here.  Otto fumbles nervously with his briefcase trying to close it."
otto,The tea?
otto,"Yeah, it was terrific."
otto,Thank you
otto,Uh excuse me.
otto,"Hey it's cool. It's cool. I like music too man, hey"
