Speaker,Dialogue
louise," ... Evening, Chance."
louise,"Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!"
chance, I'm going to work in the garden.
louise, ... I'll get you some eggs.
hayes," ... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it..."
franklin," ... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?"
chance,Oh. Thank you.
chance,"I was given meals, and a home..."
chance, Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
franklin," ... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?"
hayes, You never been in a car?
franklin," What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?"
chance," I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim."
hayes," Good day, Mr. Chance."
chance," Good day, Sally."
chance," ... Excuse me, would you please tell me where I could find a garden to work in?"
abbaz," Now, move, honkie! Before I cut your white ass!"
policeman,Good day.
david,"I'm very sorry, sir... I..."
chance, ... I can't move... My leg...
david, ... My Lord...
jeffrey,"This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured..."
chance, It's very sore.
eve," ... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital."
chance, There's no need for a hospital.
david,"Thank you, ma'am."
jeffrey,"Please, sir."
chance, Your family doctor?
chance,I agree.
eve,Would you care for a drink?
chance,Yes. Thank you.
eve, Oh? Certainly...
chance,"Hello, Eve."
eve,May I ask your name?
chance, My name is Chance.
eve,"Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?"
chance, No. I'm a gardener.
eve,Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
eve," I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner."
chance," Yes, I think he should examine my leg."
chance, ... I've never been in one of these.
wilson,It's one of Mr. Rand's. Since he's been ill...
rand, ... Eve...
eve, You heard?
chance,"Oh, fine."
allenby," ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out."
chance, ... Straight out?
allenby, Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
allenby," ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit..."
chance, Thank you.
allenby," I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort."
chance," Yes, I will."
rand,"Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner."
chance, ... I see.
rand,"Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up."
chance,Yes. I like that very much.
billings," This won't take long, Mr. Gardiner. Please hold still when I ask."
chance, Do you know Raphael?
billings,"No sir, I don't believe I do."
billings,"Yes, sir."
chance,A Black man gave me the message.
rand,I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
wilson," ... Sorry, sir - I just couldn't contain myself... I knew you were going to come out with another one of your jests about the elevator... Excuse me, sir..."
chance, ... Hmmm... Elevator.
wilson, ... Yes sir - elevator!
eve,"... Good night, Chauncey."
chance,"Good night, Eve."
allenby,"Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?"
chance," Oh, really?"
smythe,"May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?"
chance, Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
smythe, ... Sir?
chance,Yes.
smythe,"... Did you wish to see someone, sir?"
chance,"Yes, I would like to see Ben."
smythe,"Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir."
woltz," Okay, let's go to work."
chance," I see, Ben."
rand,"Excellent.  A good woman, Mrs. Aubrey."
woltz,"Good morning, Mr. Rand."
rand,"Woltz, how have you been?"
chance,Yes.
president,"I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben."
chance, Yes?
president, ... In the garden?
kaufman," Gardiner, yes, sir."
rand," ... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?"
chance," No, Ben."
allenby," Excuse us, please."
eve, ... With us ...
allenby, ... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
eve, ... But he's...?
chance,No.
jennifer,He's in the basement.
jennifer,"I don't know, Mrs. Aubrey."
chance,"Oh, yes."
kinney, ... Nothing.
courtney," ... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?"
kinney, ... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...
hull,"Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'"
chance," Hello, Morton."
colson," Here you go, Mr. Gardiner."
chance, I hope so.
dupont," Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?"
chance,"In a garden, things grow - but first some things must wither; some trees lose their leaves before they grow new leaves..."
chance," ... Then they grow thicker and stronger and taller. Some trees die, but fresh saplings replace them. Gardens need a lot of care and a lot of love."
dupont," I think your metaphors are quite interesting, Mr. Gardiner, but, haven't we seen seasons that have been devastating to certain countries?"
dupont," Such as disasterous winters, prolonged droughts that have wiped out crops, hurricanes that have all but swept away island communities? Doesn't a country need to have someone in charge that can see it through such crises?"
president,... That bastard...
dupont, Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
chance, Yes. We need a very good gardener.
chance,"Oh, yes. It is possible for one side of the garden to be flooded, and the other side to be dry..."
chance," ... Some plants do well in the sun, and others grow better in the cool of the shade."
chance, ... It is the gardener's responsibility to take water from the flooded area and run it to the area that is dry. It is the gardener's responsibility not to plant a sun-loving flower in the shade of a high wall...
rand, Splendid. Just splendid...
johanna," ... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar..."
franklin,"You know, Sally - I really feel like I've been had, and you know what that means, don't you?... It means that any political future I had is right down the toilet!"
courtney,I said - try again.
perkins,"May I take your coat, Mr. Gardiner?"
rand," ... You possess a great gift, Chauncey, of being natural. And that, my boy, is a rare talent, the true mark of a leader. You were strong and brave, yet did not moralize. I hope the entire country was watching you tonight, the entire country..."
eve," ... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older..."
kaufman,"Right, Chief."
kaufman,"Yes, sir."
chance," No, Eve. I like you to be here."
eve,"... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint..."
chance, Yes. That could be true.
eve," ... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until..."
allenby," Yes, this is Dr. Robert Allenby, would you please tell Mr. Franklin that I would like to talk to him? It concerns Chauncey Gardiner."
tv reporter,"... Do you mean, Mr. Gardiner, that you find television's coverage of the news superior to that of the newspapers?"
watson,"Mrs. Rand, how good to see you."
chance,Yes.
eve,"Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department."
chance," Hello, Dennis."
watson,"A pleasure to meet you, sir."
chance,Yes. It is.
sophie,"Eve, child! How nice of you to come."
eve,"Hello, Sophie."
sophie,And look who you brought with!
eve,"Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner..."
sophie," Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!"
eve,"Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley."
chance," Hello, Sophia."
kaufman,"Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments."
chance, Hello... His... His...
skrapinov, How is my dear friend Benjamin feeling?
sophie," Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you."
eve, Would you two excuse me for a moment?
skrapinov," ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail."
chance,I certainly do.
skrapinov,"Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you."
courtney,"... It's strictly rumor at this stage, Lyman - just something in the wind..."
stiegler,"Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books."
rand, What could be more precise than everything...?
monroe, Everything to Mrs. Rand.
townsend, Right - everything.
chance, I like to watch.
dennis," Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd."
first lady, It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
dennis' voice,Do you like it?
chance,"Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good."
eve,"Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman."
president, And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
eve," ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you..."
chance," Good night, Eve."
rand,"I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things..."
rand, ... Chauncey... Chauncey...
chance, A flower...
allenby," Yes, I suppose that's true."
chance," Will you be leaving now, Robert?"
allenby, ... Chance...?
eve,"It was very moving, Bobby - thank you so much..."
president,"We're all going to miss him, Eve...  ... Where's Mr. Gardiner?"
allenby,... He walked off...
eve,Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
president,I can certainly understand that...
first lady,"Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve..."
eve,"Thank you, Nancy."
first lady,I'll call you soon.
chance," Hello, Eve."
