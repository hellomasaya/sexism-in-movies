Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out, Now I'm the muthafucka that ya read about. Takin a life or two, that's what the hell I do. Don't like how I'm livin', well fuck you!"
lonzo,"I'm this close to firin' your monkey ass! You tryin' to start a riot up in here?! You know I don't want that hardcore shit played in my club, but I turn my back and you do that shit anyway..?"

lonzo,"You're up on that stage `cause I put you there. You're a bad ass DJ, I'll give you that, but you don't listen and I'm gettin' real tired of arguing all the time. You know it's plenty DJs out there who'll play what I want `em to play. Guys that don't bite the hand that feeds 'em. Now you take a backseat to that shit."

dre,"Yeah, and..?"

eazy,Okay so what then -- That nigga last night? Is that what we doin'?
dre,"What, Cube? Nah, he in a group right now, got some other business goin' on. But I got this group called H.B.O. from the east coast. Dope voices, and Cube wrote a song for `em that's crazy."
hbo 1,"What the fuck is ""Gankin""? And what's a ""6-4""?"
hbo 2,"I dunno, too much cussin' to get radio play. And honestly, nobody gives a fuck about Compton --"
dre,Y'all got somethin' to say about Compton? Cause we might have a problem up in this bitch.
hbo 1,This ain't us. I ain't fuckin' with this Jheri curl bullshit --
cube,"Fuck you then. Wearing a Kangol don't make you L.L. Cool J nigga, remember that."
hbo 2,Yeah. Now what?
cube,"What you wanna do, mark ass nigga?"
eazy,"Well there goes the talent. Don't know a whole lot about the music game, but we can't start a label without talent."
dre,"Well shit, why don't you get on the mic and try it?"
eazy,"What? Fool, I ain't no rapper."
dre,"You already spent the money. Don't you get it? Man, this song is all about you! This song is about Eazy-muthafuckin'-E! Now get in the booth. Let me deliver my side of this shit."

eazy,"You really gonna make me do this, huh?"
dre,"Hell yeah! That shit was tight. Only 59 more lines, E. But we gonna get through it. Hit that next line - -"
yella,"Lonzo, what you think?"
lonzo,"That some waste of time shit right there and trust me, it ain't gonna work. Won't get no radio play."
dre,You never know-- We might do a radio version and take it up to KDAY and see what happens.
lonzo,"This reality rap is never going to work, Dre. You need to hurry up and rap this shit up and finish that slow jam I had you working on. I'm serious, Dre! Hurry up with this..."
dre,"Yo, I don't know about working on this slow stuff anymore. After this I'm going to work on songs with DOC."
lonzo,"It's not a request, Dre."
dre,"Yo, if Lonzo don't like it, you know that shit is dope."
ren,"Damn, Dre -- You just turned a hustler into a rapper."
eazy,"Now this right here..? This some ruthless shit for real. Dre, you a muthafuckin' genius. And Cube, you got more of them stories to tell?"

MACOLA RECORDS - LOS ANGELES - DAY                     22  BOYZ IN THA HOOD is PLAYING OVER --  A STACK of VINYL RECORDS moves through a PRESS. A machine STAMPS a RED LABEL onto the MIDDLE. CLOSE ON the RED RUTHLESS LABEL -- BOYZ N THA HOOD.  IN THE RECEIVING AREA, EAZY picks up a couple BOXES of RECORDS. He PAYS for them, and hauls them away.  23   INT.

Yano excitedly collects the two boxes, hands over some cash. Deal done. Before Eazy can even bounce, some KIDS bumrush Yano for copies --  27   INT. K-DAY RADIO STATION - LOS ANGELES - DAY                27  BOYZ slowly fades, iconic KDAY Disc Jockey GREG MACK spinning the TRACK over the airwaves of Los Angeles.

eazy,About what?
jerry,I thought your record was good.
eazy,Just good? Why you call me in here then --
jerry,"No-no-no, hang on.  I thought it was exceptional. Please, sit back down."
eazy,Maybe I'm the one who can do somethin' for you.
jerry,"You think because I don't have some flashy office, that means I don't know what I'm talking about? Elton John, War, Styx, REO Speedwagon --"
eazy,You manage anybody this decade?
jerry,"Let me tell you what I see. Lotta raw talent. Lotta braggadoccio. But if you think anyone's gonna talk to you, if you think anyone's gonna let you into the building where you might talk to somebody -- somebody who matters -- you're crazy."
eazy,I got everything you need.
jerry,"Good, cause you're gonna have to follow this up. So what does N.W.A. stand for anyway?  No Whites Allowed?"
eazy,"""Niggas With Attitudes."""
eazy,"I asked everybody to wear something black today, `cause if we gonna be an All-Star group, we gotta look like an All-Star group."

dre,And then what-- How he get paid?
eazy,Just takes 20::percent:: off the top. That's it. We cut up 80. That's how managers work.
doc, All managers don't get 20 mothafuckin' percent!
eazy,"Doc, shut yo drunk ass up. You don't know the music business."
jerry heller,"Hey fellas, sorry I'm running late. I'll be honest. We've had a lot of passes. People are scared of you guys big time. They think you're dangerous. But I think that's a good thing. And we've had a couple nibbles, from a couple labels. Epic, Capitol, Priority..."
ren,"""Nibbles""..? What's that mean?"
jerry heller,"Here's the thing. You guys can make a real record. Sell it nationwide. But we're not there yet. These labels, they're still gonna need some... convincing. So I invited a few of them to your show. So you have to kick ass tonight. Can you do that?"
cube,And you trust this dude? Cause he looks like a one of my old muthafuckin' history teachers.
eazy,You trust me?
cube,"Yeah, I trust you. But that ain't what we talking about --"
eazy,Just leave it up to me. I'll make sure everything is straight. Just have them raps cocked and loaded.
dre,"Come on now. Cube has never failed to deliver. He always comes correct, ready to work. That ain't gonna change. Aiight?"
yella,Can this muthafucka Jerry Heller bring in more pussy? That's worth 20 percent!
bryan turner,You sure this is... safe for us..?

the crowd,AND SUCKS MY DICK!!!
jerry,So what do ya think?
record exec,"Jerry, we're friends, but Compton?  I don't think so. Queens..? Maybe. But. If you find another Bon Jovi, you call me."
eazy,"Yeah high-rollin', big money I'm foldin, Bitch on my tip for the dick I'm holdin'. Strung strawberry, jockin' me so early. Ho you want a hit --"
crowd,YOU GOTTA GET YOUR KNEES DIRTY!!!
doc,"Damn Dre, ya'll wrecked these mothafuckas tonight!"

suge,You never know what you need until you need it.
jerry,"That was quite a show, gentlemen. Nice job. Very, very nice."
cube," Ice Cube, `Sup?"
jerry,"Uh, Bryan runs Priority Records. He wants to sign you."
bryan turner,"Immediately. Fellas, I loved the show. You really had the crowd on their feet. I think you'll fit perfectly with our label."
dre,That'll work. Priority Records? I'm not familiar with your label. What artist do you got over there?
bryan turner,Nothing big. Just an R&B group.
ren,Who dat?
bryan turner,Uh-- The California Raisins.
cube,"Them little-ass raisins on the commercial? Singin', ""I Heard it Through the Grapevine""?"
bryan turner,Laugh all you want. Those little fuckers went gold last year.
eazy,Gold?
jerry,"Yep, almost platinum. Bryan has a great distribution platform."
bryan turner,So what do ya say? Wanna go make a record?
dre,"Aiight! If your rhymes ain't tight, you ain't makin' the record. So you better have your shit together. Yella Boy -- Rewind that shit!"
dre,"I'm expressin' with my full capabilities, And now I'm livin' in correctional facilities..."
dre,Now this is what I'm talkin' about. You hear the difference?
yella,"Yeah, no doubt."
jerry,Our deal with Priority is done. I have the contracts for you to sign.
dre,"Thanks, Jerry."
jerry,"The lyrics you're writing is really good, Cube."
cube,"I appreciate that, man.  Eazy what's up with our deal."
eazy,Jerry handles that.
jerry,The lawyers just started drawing them up.
tyree,"Yo Dre, there's something outside you need to take care of. Trust me."
dre,"So let me get this straight -- You gonna do this right here, right now?"
lavetta,"What am I supposed to do? We're sleepin' on a twin bed, at your auntie's house. We have a baby, Andre. You expect me to wait for what you're doin' in there? And you in the streets, fuckin' around? Are you crazy?"
dre,"What? I'm out here day and night bustin' my ass, tryin' to create something, and you gonna come up in here talkin' about some bitches? Are you crazy?"
lavetta,You don't get it.
dre,"Nah, you don't get it."
lavetta,"Bye, Andre."
yella,You cool?
dre,Fuck no. I'm far from cool.
tyree,"What happened, Dre? What she say?"
cube,"Aww shit, here we go again..."

eazy,Yeah. Here. We workin'.
dre,What we do?

jerry,"Excuse me officer, what's going on out here?!"
jerry,"These are not thugs, they're artists!"
jerry,They're rappers working in the studio right here.
jerry,I'm the manager.
eazy," This gonna start some shit, Cube."
cube," Yeah, fuck the police."
jerry,"This is only the tip of the iceberg, fellas. The days of selling records out of your trunk are a thing of the past, Eric."
eazy,My days of selling anything out the trunk is over.
bryan turner,"So, are you going out with them?"
jerry,Are you crazy? Had a enough of that shit in the 70's. I'll fly out a couple of times and check on'em.
bryan turner,"Well make sure everything goes smooth, okay? I have enough bad press with Tipper Gore and P.M.R.C. on my ass. I'm gonna have to put Parental Advisory stickers on all the records from now on --"
jerry heller,"What's wrong with that? Bryan, controversy's good -- It's gonna help us sell more records."
jerry,Excuse me.
eazy,"Yeah we are. How we supposed to protect ourselves out there, Jerry? In fuckin' Texas? And Tennessee? They lynch niggas down there --"
jerry,"I'm not gonna let you take that arsenal on tour, Eric!"
eazy,"Let me? Jerry, you take care of the business, I'll take care of the rest."
cube,Ain't that some shit... Talk some truth and people lose they minds.
eazy,They had to buy all those albums to do that! More money in our pockets.
cube,"Straight outta Compton, crazy muthafucka named Ice Cube, from a gang called Niggaz With Attitudes. When I'm called off, I got a sawed off, squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off --"

nancy reagan,"For the sake of our children, I implore each of you to be unyielding and inflexible in your opposition to drugs. Our young people are helping us lead the way. Not long ago in Oakland, California, I was asked by a group of children what to do if they were offered drugs. And I answered, just say no."
jerry," Another one called-- said she was pregnant by you too. Eric, you gotta slow down. You can't fuck'em all..."
eazy,"Yeah, I know.  All these chicks want is money. If I was broke, they're wouldn't even be calling."

eazy,"Man, stop asking about them fuckin' contract. They're coming --"
jerry,"It's all right, Eric. Cube's right to ask, and I'm remiss in not updating you guys.  Contracts are being finalized as we speak. Truth is, attorneys will bleed you dry going over `em. Wish I was paid by the hour..."
cube,Yeah me too. I just like to know what's goin' on. Since I wrote a lot of lyrics on this record.
jerry,"Everybody knows how important you are, Cube. Just give us a little more time."
cube,"Shit's pretty good. Someday, huh?"
jerry,"He wants to be you so freaking bad. This kid has issues. At some point, you gotta trust somebody..."
eazy,Waiter! Another round over here...
dre,"Nah, I think you over reacting. Eazy's one of us, Cube. What you thinking don't even make sense --"
cube,Know what don't make sense? Eazy chillin' with Jerry eatin' steak and lobster while we at Mickey D's. That shit don't make sense.

yella,"Yo, Dre. What's goin' on?"
dre,My Moms called. Tyree. He's dead. Somebody killed my little brother...
cube,"Never told y'all, but when I was twelve, my sister got murdered by her own husband-- A fuckin' wanna be cop who couldn't make it in the academy. Life changed for me that day. Everything became serious--"
eazy,Dope game took my cousin's life. I remember when they found him.
dre,He shoulda been out here with me. If he was out here-- It never woulda happened...
ren,"Or it could've happened in another way. Can't blame yourself, Dre... Life has to end for all of us, but love don't. Feel me? Tyree is always gonna be with you. No matter what."
eazy,"Gonna be aiight, Dre... We with you."
pastor,Death is a threshold we all have to pass through. No one is exempt. Tyree will set a place for us on the other side and we will see him again. The flesh will always return to the earth. But our spirits will live on forever. Amen!
dre,"If I brung him out on tour with me, like he wanted --"
verna,"This is not on you, Andre."
dre,We was supposed to kick it... Next chance I got --
verna,This is not your fault. Understand me? Stop this nonsense. Stop it now.

dre,"Damn, they comin' after us, too?"
cube,"""... advocating violence and assault is wrong and we in the law enforcement community take exception to such action."" Have they ever heard of freedom of speech? What the fuck can they do to us?"
jerry,"It's a warning. A message to our record label about ""Fuck the Police"". We should really think about not performing that song for a while."
cube,"If it was from the LAPD, then I'd be worried."
eazy,"We should all be happy, not worried. This is a gift, man. More free publicity for NWA.  That's why we gonna send this to the press. Let everybody know about this kind of harassment and intimidation by the government. Right, Jerry?"
jerry,"Well, uh. If that's what you wanna do, then maybe we --"
eazy,"Do it, Jerry. Let everybody see this bullshit."

journalist 1,How do you explain insighting a riot in Detroit? What do you have to say about that?
eaz,We didn't insight shit.
dre,You just got a snapshot of how Americans honestly feel.
ren,We didn't create that.
journalist 2,"Your songs glamorize the lifestyle of gangs, guns and drugs."
cube,My art is the reflection of my reality. What do you see when you go outside of your door. I know what i see.
yella,And it ain't glamorous.
cube,"And by the way, the hood gets AKs from Russia and cocaine from Columbia."
eazy,We don't even have passports. Check the source.
ren,Who is responsible for that?
journalist 3,You are experiencing a metoric rise. How can you explain that artits like Axl Rose from Guns and Roses are wearing your tshirts and hats?
dre,Isn't it obvious. Real recongnize real.
cube,WE must of struck a nerve.
journalist 4,"Will you be more careful about what you say, and how you say it?"
ren,Nope.
cube,"Hell no. Last I heard, this is America and we got Freedom of Speech. Pretty sure that includes rap music. Exercisin' our Free Speech across this whole damn country, openin' people's eyes. Far as I'm concerned that's our job."
journalist 4,"So Cube, what's a guy from Compton do when he starts making real money like this?"
jerry,"It's nice to see you, Cube."
cube,"Well I can barely see you, Jerry. What's with all this Godfather shit?"
jerry,"I know you've been very eager to sign a contract with Eric's company, Ruthless Records."
cube,"It's your company too, right? You and Eric. All for one, one for all."
jerry,That's incorrect. It's not my company. I work for you. I've made that clear from the beginning.
cube,"Alright, cool. So I can take this one, show it to a lawyer or somethin'?"
jerry,"Cube, lawyers get paid to make trouble. That's what they do -- create problems where problems don't exist."
cube,But I have no idea what it says. At least let me take it to show my family.
jerry,"I can assure you, it's all standard. You can read it now, if you like."
cube,"Jerry, you know I can't understand this legal shit. None of us can. That's why we need to show it to a lawyer--"
jerry,"Cube, I thought you knew? Everyone else signed already. You're the only one who hasn't."
cube,What the fuck..?
jerry,Look. Cube. This is a great thing. This is what you always wanted your whole life. And there's also this.
cube,"Damn.  Thanks, man."
jerry,"Soon as you sign this contract, the money is all yours."
cube,"That's my money anyway, Jerry. I earned it. I wrote a lot of hit songs. I been on tour for months. "
jerry,That's ridiculous.
cube,"Give me my money, Jerry."
jerry,"You're kidding me, right? Who do you think pays for everything? All the hotel rooms, the parties, the transpo? You think that's free?"
cube,"Why all this now,   Jerry? Back in the beginning, if   you thought we were so good, why   didn't you just give us contracts   then?"
jerry,"Nothing's a sure thing, Cube. Even a great talent can crash and burn. Too much ego, too much excess, too many expectations -- it tends to ruin things. You oughta keep that in mind."
cube,"I'm gonna ask one more time. Are you sayin' I can't have the money I earned, unless I sign this contract, right now, without showin' it to anybody?"
ren,I'mma get me a El Camino with some gold Daytons and a Phantom top.
yella,"I can't wait to get out of that ""po- man's Porsche"" and get me some real shit --"
cube,Y'all signed that Ruthless contract without a lawyer?
ren,Yeah -- And we got paaaaaid!
yella,"For $75,000 dollars, I don't give a fuck what's in that contract!"
dre,You ain't signed?
cube,"Hell naw I ain't signin' that bullshit. Don't y'all think it's a little fucked up that Jerry won't let us show it to nobody? That seem honest to y'all? If he offered us seventy-five thousand, he probably owes us double that.  Thought we talked about this, dude?"
ren,It is what it is... I don't trust Jerry but I trust Eric.
cube,"At this point, Eric and Jerry in this thing together. Believe dat!"
eazy,What up with Doc and Suge?
yella,"Guess that dude's ""managing"" him now. One day you Bobby Brown's bodyguard, next day you reppin' talent. Everybody wanna get into the act..."
dre,"Yo Cube-- You can't just sign that shit, homie..? Keep making history..?"
cube,"Naw man, not like this. I'd rather be broke then get fucked -- Why did you sign that shit, Dre?"
dre,"Nigga, I got bills to pay -- and I need to put some money in my Momma's hands after Tyree passed."
cube,"Yo, I get it. Everybody gotta do what they gotta do. They're gonna take care you. You they're bread and butter."
dre,"Cube, we Ruthless."
cube,"Nah, we NWA. They Ruthless."
jinx,"Can't believe you left the group, man. What you gonna do now? Guess we gotta start working on some solo stuff, huh? Cube? Cube?!"
cube,How you doing? My name O'Shea. What's yours?
kim,Kim.
cube,Hey Kim-- You the best thing I've seen all day.
kim,What you think?
bryan,"Wow, you're really leaving the group..."
cube,"Yeah, I'm tired of the games. Eazy puts everything on Jerry and Jerry puts everything on Eazy. They can have it."
bryan,How do you feel about that Kim? Is he making a big mistake?
kim,"I don't think so-- after hearing everything that happened, I would've left too. Now he has the chance to showcase all his talents."
bryan,"Well, I believe in you Cube, so I'll tell ya what: there's not a lot of money in this right now, but if this first record hits, I'll make it up to you on the next one."
cube,Well get ready--   `cause these albums are gonna   be comin' real fast. I'm hungry   and I got a lot to say that's gonna   fuck the world up.
bryan turner,Who're you gonna get to produce? Ruthless is probably gonna veto Dre working on the project. So what's your plan?
cube,If I can't get the best producer in the in the west. I gotta go get the best in the east.
cube,Kickin' shit called street knowledge. Why more niggas in the pen than in college? Now cause of that line I might be your cellmate. That's from the nigga ya love to hate.
cube track," Yeah, HA-HA! I'm the nigga ya love to hate --"
eazy,Cube's record's in the Billboard top 20! Our shit never even came close to that. He's blowin' the fuck up --
jerry,"It's gonna be fine, Eric. It's not just NWA anymore, it's our whole Ruthless roster. "
eazy,We gotta keep Dre happy. Keep him motivated.
jerry,Look at him. You think he needs anymore motivation than that?
eazy,Yeah I get it. He drownin' in pussy. But that don't mean --
jerry,"You gotta stop worrying so much. Let me do the worrying for you. Fact is, Ren can write just as good as Cube. Maybe even better. Come over here a minute --"
eazy,We done with this shit now?
jerry,We're done.
eazy,"Thanks, Jerry. I'mma go fuck now."
dre,"Wuddup, Suge -- You good?"
suge,Are you?
dre,Fucked up about what? I been bangin' that shit.
suge,I'm on it.
cube,"I'm just tellin' you what you told me. If Amerikkka's Most blew up, you'd advance me for the follow-up. That's what you said."
bryan turner,"It's more complicated than that, Cube, there's metrics --"
cube,"Come on, Bryan. I don't even know what that means. "
bryan turner,Cube. Relax. We're on the same team here. I'm your biggest fan --
cube,"It's like this shit keeps happenin' to me, no matter what I do. When people do the work, they should get paid. Why you making it seem like I'm begging for some shit that's technically mine?"
bryan turner,Of course your not begging -- and I'm not trying to be difficult.
cube,But you can't help me. That's what you're sayin'.
bryan turner,"Cube, wait, Cube, come back --"
bryan turner,"STOP! STOP! WHAT THE FUCK, CUBE!??!"
ren,... Prisoner like a hostage. You shoulda covered your muthafuckin' head like an ostrich. Deep in the dirt cause you a sucka. And your ass up high so I can kick the muthafucka --
eazy,That's what I'm talkin' about. Cube ain't shit.
dre,How you figure? That record's still the hottest shit out there.
yella,For real. Cube killed it --
eazy,That's why we gotta go hard at him. We gonna look like some bitches if we just take that shit.
eazy,"Man, why you gotta be drunk all the time? Get your shit together."
tomica,"This place is nice. Wow, I didn't realize this was a real ""date"" date. I thought we were just going out to eat. You bring all your females here?"
eazy,"Only the special ones.  High as it is, it better be."
tomica,"You know I have a job, right?"
eazy,"Excuse me, Miss Record Executive."
tomica,"Executive Assistant. Ya know, you don't have to impress me. We could've went to Fat Burgers. I just like hangin with you. You make me laugh. That's good enough for me, you know? We can just chill."
suge,Doc shouldn't even be alive. He got thrown from the car-- hit a tree.
dre,Goddamn. Is he paralyzed?
suge,Nah. His throat got crushed. Doctor said he'll never talk right again.
dre,Vocal chords?
suge,All fucked up. Career could be in jeopardy . Where's Eazy and Jerry?
dre,I don't know.
suge,Them niggas ain't loyal. Taking they're fuckin' time to come see the man. That's why I got my people looking into his contracts at Ruthless. Gotta protect what he got left.
dre,He aiight. I guess.
suge,What about your paperwork? Is it cool?
dre,I dunno. I just focus on the music. . Maybe your people could look into my shit too?
suge,Most definitely. I can arrange that.
bryan turner,"Cube, Kim -- Great to see you guys. How's that new house treating you?"
kim,The new house is great. Thanks for asking. How's the new office?
bryan turner, Great. I never did like the design of the old one anyway.
cube,"What you got, Bryan? I know you called me up here for somethin'."
bryan turner,"It's the new NWA record. I wanted to play it for you first, before you heard it anywhere else --"
cube,Benedict Arnold.
kim,They're trying to call you some kind of a traitor.
cube,I'm a traitor!? I didn't say shit about NWA on Amerikkka's Most Wanted! But now they're trying to diss. Okay.
kim,"Baby, tell me what you're thinking."
cube,I can't wait to get to the mothafuckin' studio!
cube,"God DAMN I'm glad y'all set it off. Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft. First you was down with the AK. And now I see you on a video with Michel'le. Lookin' like straight Bozos. I saw it comin', that's why I went solo."
yella,That shit's kinda funny.
ren,Mothafucka got us! What we gonna do? I got my pen ready to serve that fool. Just say the word.
jerry,"We'll sue that worthless fuck. Defamation, libel... That anti- Semitic piece of shit, I'm gonna call up my friends at the J.D.L. and we'll see how he likes that, little bastard.  Eric, come on, we gotta get organized here, we gotta fight --"
eazy,"Stop it, Jerry. Relax man. Niggas don't know what anti-Semitic means - - It's just a battle rap."
jerry," I always knew Cube was a rotten human being. And people are gonna know the facts. I'll make sure of it. I can't believe you're not as angry as I am, what's wrong with you? Didn't you hear what he said?"
eazy,"I heard it, Jerry. You deal with it your way, I'll deal with it mine. All we got to do is hit the studio and end this boy career."
yella,I don't know about all that.
jerry,Well call Dre and you guys go do it!
ren,"Damn, E. Who work for who?"
eazy,Who you see sitting in the big chair mothafucka?!
jerry,Help you with something?
large man,This your house?
jerry,Who's asking?
large man,It's a real nice house.
jerry,Who are you? Are you with Suge Knight? Someone else? Ice Cube?
large man,"Have yourself a good night, Jerry."
cube,Fuck'd y'all say!?
dre,Still can't believe it. It's like they're enjoying themselves.
eazy,"Least they got it on video. LAPD gonna have a real good time on that level 3 prison yard, know what I mean?"
dre,"Yep, we got they asses this time. Tape don't lie."
jerry,Just need a word with Dre --
suge,It can wait. Let the man work.
suge,Yo Dre. Hold up.
dre,What you mean by that?
suge,Everything you need to know. It's all in there. 
dre,Nah. I got this.
eazy,"So, what'd you wanna see me about? Sounded all worked up on the phone."
dre,I know you don't like hearin' this shit. But it's about Jerry. We gotta get rid of that muthafuck --
eazy,Is that seriously the reason you wanted to talk? I thought we were past all that --
dre,"I found out some information, Eric. Real shit. I had some people look at this, and I ain't gettin' my fair share."
eazy,"You know why you rich, Dre? You know why you live in a big ass house and don't sleep on a couch no more? Do you know why you fuck the finest bitches? That's Jerry, dude. He broke us through the door. He made this shit happen, and you wanna turn on him just like Cube --"
dre,"Cube was right, fool! You gotta look at these papers, E. Just look and you'll see. "
eazy,"You think that's right, turning your back on somebody? After all he's done for us?"
dre,You mean all he's done for you.
eazy,"Thought you were mine, too."
ren,"Everything cool, E?"
yella,Yo where Dre at anyway --
eazy,"Man, fuck Dre."
yella,Whatchu mean?
eazy,Why don't y'all ask him.
ren,Fuck you talkin' about? He comin' or not --
eazy,"That nigga quit. So nah, he ain't comin'. But fuck it, we gonna keep this shit movin'. Don't need that punk anyway..."
suge,This shit sounds good.
dre,"None of this means anything, while I'm under contract with Ruthless."
suge,Don't worry about that. I promise you that I'll get you out of your contracts.
snoop,"What's up, Cuz."
suge,"Yo who the fuck's this, Warren?"
snoop,"Snoop Doggy Dog, Cuz. Who are you?"
dre,Glad y'all came by. Your demo was tight.
snoop,"Thanks, Dre."
dre,"Well listen, I'm workin' on a track for this movie called ""Deep Cover."" I want you to get down on it."
snoop,For real?
eazy,Hello?
eazy,Talk to Jerry.
eazy,Where the hell is Dre? You said he'd be here --
suge,"Don't worry about Dre.  Truth be told, he ain't got nothing to do with this right here."
eazy,"Whatever homie. You think I'm signing that shit, you crazier then I thought. I'm out --"
suge,Naw. I think you gonna stay awhile.
eazy,"Fuck you, Suge. I ain't scared of none you niggas, cuzz!"
suge,"You can talk tough all you want-- but this ain't no record.  Don't make me change you, Eric Wright."
eazy,The fuck is that supposed to mean?
suge,These niggas will take something from you that you can't get back.
blood,"Just let me murder this Crab, Suge."
suge,Naw. That's too easy.  I got a whole night planned for you if you don't sign them release forms.
eazy, Dirty mothafucka...
jerry,"Jesus Christ, Eric. You can't just... I thought you were --"
jerry,Hey. You gotta tell me what's going on. I can tell when something's --
eazy,"I gotta kill that mothafucka, Suge. I just wanted you to know that shit's about to get thick around here."
jerry,You're not gonna do that.
eazy,I didn't come over here to ask you - - I came to tell you. 
jerry,"You do that, it's gonna ruin everything we've built --"
eazy,"I have to do it! This is the streets, muthafucka! I don't have a choice! He came at me! He came at us. We don't hit back, it's over! Done! Put a fork in this shit!"
jerry,Eric. Listen to me. I never said we won't hit back. But this isn't Compton. We don't hit back with bullets. We do it with lawyers. We drain those assholes.
eazy,"I don't care about the money, Jerry. Ain't about the money."
jerry,"Of course it is. You're smarter than those criminals. You wanna kill somebody? Then you'll be in prison, forever. No more family. No more Ruthless. No more anything."
journalist,Are you Anti-Semitic?
cube,What? I thought this interview was about the Rodney King trial?
journalist,"The J.D.L. has recently gotten involved, saying that the lyrics regarding your former manager Jerry Heller --"
cube,I'm not Anti-Semitic. I'm Anti- Jerry Heller. Let me ask you a question -- do they condone Jerry's behavior when it comes to my situation? Him trying to get me to sign a contract without legal representation?
journalist,I have no idea.
cube,"Well, you get me that answer and then we can continue on this topic. Until then, let's talk about the beating of an unarmed motorist -- Rodney King and the trial of 4 guilty L.A.P.D. Officers who seem to be Darryl Gates' standard issue - -"
journalist,"But it isn't just the Jewish community. The Korean grocer community have also accused you of racism, mostly because of your song ""Black Korea"" --"
cube,"Come on, man. That don't even make no sense. Black Korea is just a warning. That's it. I'm a journalist, just like you! Reporting on what's going on in the hood. But the difference is that I'm brutally honest about it. Cause sugar coating will get you diabetes."
journalist,What's your relationship with the Nation of Islam?
cube,"There my brothers. That question alone just proves how unprepared of a ""sandbag reporter"" you really are. You wanna talk about Anti- Semitism? Then it's ""Black Korea,"" and now you wanna talk about the Nation of Islam? Seriously, man. What's your agenda? You can't focus on one thing? Ask me something interesting. I'm not an elected official. I'm an artist. You haven't asked me one damn question about music. I'm America's conscience. I represent the good, the bad and the ugly. What you represent?"
dre,What you fools doin' out here?
doc, Looking stupid as a mothafucka.
snoop,"Come take a ride with us Dr. Dre. You gotta get out this house, Cuz and get your mind right."
snoop,"What you so tense for, Cuz?"
dre,I'm cool.
dre,"First time in my life, I feel like I'm forcin' it."
dre,Too much outside interference -- Eazy and Jerry tryin' to starve me out. Playin' games with my money. Tryin' to get me back in there on my hands and knees --
snoop,Is that why you ain't got no furniture?
dre,"Nah, that ain't me. I'm good."
dre," Fuck it, gimme that shit."
snoop,That shit right there? That's the Chronic.
dre,"No. I can feel it in my nuts, man. Is that normal?"
snoop,Oh shit. Keep playing that.
jerry,"We're about to get back into the game in a big way, Eric --"
eazy,Yeah? How you figure?
jerry,Are you just trying to insult me?
eazy,"Do you really believe that bullshit? All I know is Cube's doin' big things, makin' movies and shit. And I keep hearin' about this album Dre workin' on --"
jerry,"Dre's a fuckin' producer, Eric! Producer's don't rap! It's never gonna work! Period!"
dre,You look like you're ready to go.
nicole, I'm just waiting on my friend. I knew I should've drove.
dre,You're not having fun?
nicole,"Oh no, it was fun. I had a lot of fun. But now it's starting to get a little wild."
dre,"Yeah, it does get crazy around here sometimes.  Hi, I'm Andre."
dre,"Hey Nicole, why don't you come over here with me and kick it for a while til your friend gets back."
nicole,"I don't know, maybe another time and another place. But not now."
dre,Do it look like I give a fuck right now? Can't you see I'm tryin' to make a Love Connection?
nicole,"No, he's trying make a friend connection."
dre,A friend connection?
nicole,"Speaking of friends, I need to go find mine before she gets too lost."
dre,You want me to help you?
nicole,"No, seems like you need to get back to your game. I'll talk to you later."
dre,"I'mma find you, Nicole!"
snoop,FREESTYLE TBD...
dre,"Yeah.  Shit's crazy, right."
dre,MY FUCKIN' MASTERS!
dre,What do you mean that everyone is passing on this record?
suge,What do you think?
dre,"It's not hip-hop? Shit, it's the future. Ain't no more money in sampling everythang."
suge,This guy has a lot of money. This is the only shot we got.
dre,"Okay, shoot."
jimmy, Jimmy Iovine. Interscope Records. It's nice to meet you. Dre or Dr Dre. What should I call you?
dre,Dre's cool. How are you doing? I heard John McClain gave you my album. What did you think?
jimmy iovine,"I think it was great.  So, you're the artist on this record. Who produced it?"
dre,I did.
jimmy iovine,Who engineered it?
dre,I did.
jimmy iovine,"Listen. I don't know anything about hip hop. And to be honest with you, I don't necessarily care for it. But I know this is special."
dre,Thank you.
suge,We'd love to bring it to Interscope. But there's a problem.
jimmy iovine,What's the problem?
suge,Ruthless. Lawsuits.  Contracts.
jimmy iovine,How about this. Give me three weeks. But I don't want to hear any bullshit about you shopping it anywhere else. If you do that. I believe I can get you out of this mess. Sound good?
eazy,Sorry? We all ought to be sorry...  We had them on tape -- we had their asses on tape.
crowd,"No justice, no peace! Everybody say, fuck the police! No justice, no peace! Everybody say, fuck the police!  A very proud Cube watches. His own words turned into a unifying slogan for the riots. And we see --  103   ARCHIVAL NEWS FOOTAGE                                       103  Of the riots -- angry, violent.

They divide them into smaller BAGS."
yella,So all this weed. It's for your Ruthless artists?
eazy,"Havin' some cash flow problems. They can smoke it, they can sell it, I don't care. As long as it keeps 'em off my back for a minute."
yella,"Maybe you should think about diversifying into my kinda shit. There's money in there, too."
eazy,"What, makin' pornos? No thanks, man. That's your thing. I'll stick with this music shit. Once my new album right here's done, I'mma be fine --"
ren,"You all right, man?"
eazy,"Yeah. Just tired. All this shit, downsizin' to a new crib, just weighin' on me. I'll figure it out though. I always do."
eazy,"I'll come when I can, Jerry."
jerry,Eric --
dre,"Man, this is just the beginning... We're building an empire."
suge,You're in my spot!
dre,"Suge, it's cool --"
suge,Did you park in my muthafuckin' parking space or not?
employee,"I didn't know, I --"
suge,Now move yo' piece of shit and park my car.
cube,Hey Darrell. What you been doing? -- playin' with Shea?
kim,Look how young you guys look.
cube,Damn... We left some good records on the table...
kim,Well-- ain't nobody burnt down the table did they? Ever thought about getting back together?
cube,"All the time. But we've been feuding for so long. It might be ""ON"" on sight when we see each other. I really don't know."
kim,That's a shame. It's terrible how money tears us apart.
cube,Yeah-- When it should be bring us together. Somebody always wants more then they're suppose to get. As that's when shit get funky.
dre,Aren't you glad I tracked you down?
nicole,I wasn't exactly hiding.
dre,"So wassup, you been havin' good time?"
nicole,Yeah... Why?
dre,"Well I mean, I like comin' over your place, but you know, your neighbors be complainin' about ""the noise"" --"
nicole,"So what, you want me to move?"
dre,"Yeah, maybe. I know of a perfect spot. Plenty of room, and I know the owner."
nicole,"After a few months, you sure you're ready for that, Andre?"
dre,Yeah. I'm really feelin' you like that.
nicole,"I'm feelin' you too, but..."
dre,"Hey you know what, don't worry about it right now. Was just a thought..."
nicole,Wasn't what I'd call a good fit. It got crazy once we moved to L.A. I definitely went through some unnecessary shit when he started acting like an asshole. But I have a beautiful son and all that other nonsense is behind me now.
dre,"Look, no offense, but I'm a little glad he was an asshole.  His loss is my gain. To assholes."
nicole, Chin-chin.
nicole,All right -- Good night.
dre,Really? Good night?
nicole,Are you okay to drive?
dre,No.
nicole,"Good night, Andre."
dre,"See, I can't help thinkin', maybe you want me to come inside..."
nicole,Of course I do.
dre,So what's different now?
nicole,"I got a lot of things to think about.  You're asking me to move in... That's a big step. I like you, Andre. But there's a lot going on around you."
dre,What do you mean?
nicole,"I read the papers. I'm not stupid. I know about the whole Death Row business, the assault charges, the shooting... Just seems dangerous. My son's my world."
dre,But I thought we been havin fun.
nicole,"Fun is fun, Andre. But I refuse to walk away from one crazy life into another."
dre," Nah man, I'm good."
dre,Wha'up Pac?
tupac,Oh shit! Wha'up Dre... I'm about to hit niggas in the mouth with this new album. Suge said you got some heat for a nigga.
dre,Nigga what? I do...guess who I worked with last night.
tupac,Who dat?
dre,Roger fuckin' Troutman. Man this shit is fire. Wait til you hear it.
tupac,Oh! OK what you thinking about calling it?
dre,I'm thinking about calling it California love.
dre,What the fuck y'all doin?
suge, You know what to do.
poor bastard,I'd like to make a toast...
room,To Death Row...
goon girl, May the west coast reign forever.
poor bastard, May the west coast reign forever.
poor bastard,I'd like to make a toast to Suge. For making this all happen.
suge,Don't forget to toast Dr. Dre. you little bitch ass mothafucka!
dre," Hold the fuck up! Put cha' glasses down. Put your fuckin clothes on. What the fuck is going on around here?! Seriously, what's going on?!"
suge,"Its okay, Dre."
dre,This shit is stupid! Do ya'll know what it took for us to get here. Do y'all know what you doin'? Y'all fuckin' it up! Y'all fucking it up!  And what the fuck ya'll doing here?!
suge, Who fuckin' shit up! You trippin. We can do anything we want to do. We started this shit. This is us.
dre,"Nah, Nigga. Death Row is us.  This other shit -- is you!"
dre,'Tha fuck you talking too?
dre,What the fuck?!!!
suge,Man don't even trip off this muthafucka. What he going to do? Where he going to go?
nicole,"Anybody else been here to see you, your so-called friends at Death Row?"
dre,Nope. You're the only one I wanna see anyway.
nicole,112 days? That doesn't even make sense.
dre,"Yeah, well... That's what happens when you violate your probation."
nicole,You got one phone call and you called me?
dre,`Cause you were right. Only other person that tells it to me like it is-- is my moms. So I know you care.
nicole,"You take care of yourself, Andre."
eazy,I feel like I don't know what I'm doin' anymore. I don't even know where the money's going.
tomica,"I can help, you know. Show me the files, the bills, the contracts. I know the business, I know how it all works. Let me look. Baby, if you're feelin' this way, Jerry's not doin' right by you."
eazy,Okay. After New York. Workin' on that International Distribution with Sony. Jerry don't know about that. I wanna keep it that way.
cube, Heads up y'all. This lil nigga might wanna do something.
eazy,Relax everybody. Just came in the club-- heard you were over here.
cube, What you need?
eazy,I don't need shit. Out here with Bone Thugs-- Was just in the neighborhood. Wanted to say wassup.
cube,Thought you said it was an after- school special.
eazy,"Missed you, boy."
cube,"Missed you too, E. Wish we could've work shit out."
eazy,"Guess it all happened like it was supposed to. You a movie star-- I'm a music mogul. Dre. Well Dre is tripping right now, but he's doing his thang. Just wanted to come over here and put something on your mind.."
eazy,I wish all that bullshit never happen between us. 
cube,Never should've dissed each other in the first place. Made our fans choice between us. That ain't cool.
eazy,Yeah you right.  Ever though we was going to be this big?
cube,Nope. I was reminiscing with my wife the other day. What it felt like-- In the beginning. We were so young and ferocious. Doing music straight for the hood. Trying to be ghetto stars... I thought I knew everything back then -- But I didn't know shit.
eazy,"Me neither. I'm still trying to figure this stuff out. One minute I'm slangin' in a crack house -- next thing I know, they invite me to the White House."
cube,Yeah. I get it. Everything changes so fast. Feels like it was 20 years ago. If we were still together do you know how large we'd be?
eazy,You ever think about fuckin' with some new NWA shit?
cube,I'd be lyin' if I said I never thought about it.
eazy,"Me too, Cube. Been thinkin' about it a lot.  Be like 1989 again. We changed the world forever. Mothafuckas can never go back to that fake shit after us. It gets no realer then NWA. No matter what..."
cube,"If you can get Dre to do it, I'm in. But check this out homie-- I ain't doin' it if Jerry's around. He done made enough off us."
eazy,I hear you.
cube,Cool. We done talked til the damn club closed -- I got a car coming. You need a ride back to your hotel?
eazy,"Naw, I'm cool. I wanna walk."
cube," Walk? It's cold as fuck Eric, this ain't L.A."
eazy,I'm good. Hit me up later.
jerry,"Wait, aren't you gonna sign --"
eazy,I'mma take these home with me. I'll sign 'em. Get'em back to you in a couple days.
jerry,"But this is how we've always done it. You have a lot on your plate Eric, there's no need to add to it --"
eazy,"It's cool, Jerry. They're my bills, my checks. I mean look, my name's right there."
jerry,I just wish we could do it here. I don't want anything to get misplaced or lost --
eazy,"Don't worry so much, Jerry. I can handle it."
tomica,You had to know the truth sometime. Now you do.
eazy,Cube tried to warn me. So did Dre. And I didn't listen. I fucked up.
jerry,Where the fuck have you been? I've been calling you --
eazy,"This ain't about Tomica, Jerry. It's about you. And you really gotta stop acting like you never did anything wrong."
jerry,"Look, I know you're upset. But I'd strongly advise you to take a breath, let me look at the paperwork --"
eazy,"Jerry, for real? You can stop givin' me advice. As of, like, now. I'm getting NWA back together. It's happening. But you ain't gonna have nothing to do with it this time."
jerry,Why would you say something like that? You're not thinking straight. 
eazy,"Trust. God damn, that's a word. Let me tell you somethin', Jerry. Trust is a muthafucka."
jerry,"Look, if what I've done is so illegal, why have I never been sued? I'm such a thief, such a liar, such a motherfucker, how come nobody's come to collect? This is business. This is how it works. It's not always pretty, but all of it, everything I've put into this company, my whole LIFE for all these years, it's for you, Eric."
eazy,"You're fired, Jerry."
jerry,"Goddammit, Eric! This is not how we do things! This is a business and I won't let you --"
dre,Hello?
eazy's voice,"Wassup Andre, it's Eric."
dre,Yeah? Wassup wit you?
eazy,Just felt like callin' --
dre,Yeah. Okay.  Wassup?
eazy,You know. Doin' my thing. Makin records. Killin' all that pussy out there.
dre,Just makin' tracks.
eazy,"That Snoop record you did was big. 850,000 copies in the first week?! Congratulations on the success of that."
dre,Good lookin' out.
eazy,"Well look, I know you're busy, but I talked to Cube, and we were, like, talkin' about some... possibilities."
dre,Really. Well it's about time. He's the reason why we broke up.
eazy,"Listen man, I know everything got messed up and went the wrong way. I wish it didn't. I wish we can go back to the days of Skateland when we were all just young, hungry and ferocious. The world's most dangerous group. Before all the money and fame got between us."
dre,"Yeah me too-- cause I'm not proud of all the shit I did, either."
eazy,"So you think maybe, we can make somethin' happen?"
dre,"Yeah, that's sounds cool -- Let's stay in touch."
eazy,Fair enough.
ren,"Wuddup, y'all."
yella,"Hey so, when are Dre and Cube gonna roll in here?"
ren,"Yeah, you know -- Gettin' kinda anxious to get this new shit goin'."
eazy,"I don't know. Hopefully soon. Let's just get ready. New NWA gonna change the game, just like back in the day --"
ren,No doubt. I got books of new shit --
yella,"Yo, you alright, Eazy?"
eazy,"Yeah. Just. Like. Need some fresh air, somethin' --"
tomica,Eric!
tomica,You gonna say something? Is it a respiratory infection -- pneumonia?
doctor,"Yes, well, it is those things... and more, I'm afraid... We ran a full blood battery and --  Mr. Wright, I'm sorry but you've tested positive for the HIV virus."
eazy,Get the fuck outta here.
doctor,"The normal T-cell count is anywhere between 500 and 1500. Right now,"
eazy,But I ain't no faggot.
doctor,"Mr. Wright, there are actually quite a few ways that the virus can be transmitted --"
eazy,It's wrong. No way. Test me again. Test my shit again --
doctor,"We've actually run the test five times, with five different samples... and the results remain --"
eazy,Tomica. She's pregnant. Oh fuck. Does that mean she --
doctor,"No. Not necessarily. But we'll need to test her, too."
eazy,So what do we do? What's the treatment? Let's get started. 
doctor,"Mr. Wright. You need to understand. You're very, very sick --"
eazy,But I don't even feel that bad...
doctor,"With treatment, and palliative care, we can probably keep you comfortable for... maybe six months. At the very most."
eazy,Comfortable? What you mean comfortable? Six months!?
doctor,"I'm truly sorry, Mr. Wright."
eazy,Just glad you're okay. You and the baby.
tomica,No. We can beat this. Together.
eazy,Yo.
ren's voice," Eazy! What the fuck, cuz? People been sayin' some crazy shit. Like you got AIDS or somethin'? Can you believe that? Muthafuckin' Eazy-E got AIDS? Niggas be starting too many rumors, huh?"
tomica,Who was that?
nicole,It's for you.
dre,What up.
yella,"It's Bone Thugs' new LP. It's good, Eric. It's gonna be huge when it drops. Everybody thinks so. Want me to play it for you?"
eazy,Put it on the table. I'll listen later. Thanks for stoppin' through. Hit you when I get outta here.
tomica,I can't. That's not the way it should happen. It's not right --
eazy,"Please. It's gotta happen, baby. I'm having my surgery tomorrow, so it has to happen now. Because I might not. Wake up."
tomica,Don't say that.
eazy,"It's true, Tomica. I gotta make this right. Ron says it's the only way to protect everything I built."
tomica,It's so... fucked up --
eazy,Hey. Listen to me. It doesn't matter what people think. They don't know. They don't understand. There's no other way. Please. I know it's not the way you pictured it. You deserve better.
tomica,"Okay. I love you, Eric."
pastor,Are we ready?
dre," Yo, Eazy. Wanna tell you somethin'. I know you can hear me. I know you're still in there --"
cube,S'up Dre?
dre,"Good to see you, Cube."
cube,You see him? How he look?
dre,He looks the same -- like Eric just sleeping. But he's in a coma. Got a machine breathing for him --
cube,"Can't see him like that, man. This is bad. I asked one of his homies to call me when he wakes up."
dre,Okay.
suge,"What's the urgency, Dre?"
dre,"I'm out, man. I'm out of Death Row."
suge,You're not making any sense. Death Row and Dr. Dre are one in the same. You can't just up and go.
dre,"Gonna do my own thing now. Start fresh. Nobody to answer to but myself. It's time, Suge."
suge,"You're one stupid muthafucka. You just gonna throw away all this money? `Cause if you leave, everything we created is mine."
dre,What we created? Ha -- Well you can have it.
suge,You ain't takin nobody with you. Death Row stays Death Row. And if you even think about touching my money? You know how I handle shit.
dre,Do what you gotta do. I'm still out.
suge,You're not gettin none of it.
dre,"I don't give a fuck-- You can't put a price on peace of mind. So you can keep the artists, the money, the masters and the bullshit. I'm startin' my own thing."
suge,What you gonna call it?
dre,Aftermath.
