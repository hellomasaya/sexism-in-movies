Speaker,Dialogue
grifters,by Donald E. Westlake
jeweler,"Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry."
myra,Why? What's wrong?
jeweler," You are a valued customer, as you know."
myra,But what's wrong?
jeweler,I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
myra,What is?
jeweler," This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry."
myra,But they must be! They cut glass!
jeweler," Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?"
myra,It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
jeweler," Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars."
myra,All right.
jeweler, I'll get you a check.
jeweler,"I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry."
myra,It's not your fault.
jeweler,"You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in..."
myra,I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
jeweler,"Well, I'd have to see it, of course."
myra,You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
jeweler,I see.
jeweler,"You know something, Mrs. Langtry? A bracelet like that very rarely happens. A fine setting and workmanship usually mean precious stones. It always hurts me when I find they're not. I always hope --  -- I'm mistaken."
myra,Thank you. For everything you felt you could do.
cop,Sir? Everything all right?
roy,"Getting better. A bad shrimp, I think."
cop,Want us to take you to a doctor?
roy,"No no, I'm fine now, thanks, anyway. Still got a lot of clients to see."
cop,"Take it easy, now."
roy,"Oh, I will."
simms,"Put it this way, now. Say I rent to a woman, well, she has to have a room with a bath. I insist on it, because otherwise she's got the hall bath tied up all the time, washing her goddamn hair and her clothes and everything she can think of."
simms,"Now, your minimum for a room with bath is three hundred a month, just for a place to sleep and no cooking allowed. And just how many of these tootsies make that kind of money and have to eat in restaurants and buy clothes and --"
roy,Mr. Simms.
simms," Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--"
roy, Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
simms,I'll send her right up.
simms,"I had my first hotel thirty-seven years ago in Wichita Falls, Texas, and that's where I began to learn about women. They just don't make the money, you see, not regular they don't, and there's only one way they can get it."
simms,"Now, that Mr. Dillon there, that's the fine type of person I have in mind for here. Like yourself, I have no doubt. He's a salesman, regular as clockwork, has a suite here. Fine man. Now, about these women. At first, you know, they just go out and do it now and then, just enough to make ends meet. But pretty soon they got that bank open twenty-four hours a day, and then you've got trouble. Hookers and hotellin' just don't mix. You'd think the cops'd be too busy catching real criminals, not snooping around after working girls, but that's the way the gravy stains, as the saying is, and I don't fight it. An ounce of prevention is my motto."
simms,"Oh, yes, Mrs. Langtry, he's up there, he's expecting you."
simms,"If you keep out the women in the first place, see, you keep out the hookers, and then you keep out the cops, and that's how you have a clean place."
roy,Your medicine is here.
myra," Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?"
roy,"Always, for you, baby."
myra,"You aren't taking me for granted, are you?"
roy,Taking you for granite?
roy,"That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all."
myra, Are you sure?
roy, Let's find out.
lilly,I'm done here. Do I come back to Baltimore?
irv,Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
lilly,Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
irv,"Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo."
lilly, I know.
irv,"Take two, three days. Call when you get there."
lilly,Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
myra,Roy?
roy,Mm?
myra,Look at me.
roy,"Oh, I am, baby, believe me."
myra,Roy? It this all we have?
roy,All? It ain't bad.
myra,No more than this?
roy,"What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?"
myra,I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
myra,What's that?
roy,"Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?"
myra," No, baby. Come to Mama."
myra,"Wore you out, did I? It's a good woman you can't keep down, baby."
myra,"Have a good sleep, baby. Call you tomorrow."
roy,Wait'll next year.
roy,Damn that guy.
roy,Smack.
roy,Heads.
roy,Heads.
roy,Tails.
roy,Tails.
roy, How much can I bet?
dealer,"That's between you two. I got nothing at stake here, I'm just dealing."
shill,What if we both guess wrong? You aren't gonna take...
roper,We got him now! Put down that big bill you got.
roy, The fifty or the hundred?
roper,The hundred! Hurry!
roy, The ace is what I want?
roper,Sure it is!
roy,Is that okay?
shill,You're damn right that's okay.
dealer," Whoever finds the ace, wins."
roy, Dark in here.
roy,Too dark. I just can't see.
roy,"Let me borrow these, will you?"
roy,"Now, that's better."
mintz,I didn't teach you that.
roy, You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
roy,Let me see how you did that one.
mintz,Scram. Go home.
roy,I can't. I just left home.
mintz,You're too young. You should be in school.
roy,I am in school.
mintz,Where's the five?
roy,In your other hand.
lilly, Roy?
lilly,Roy? You asleep?
roy,Myra?
lilly, My God!
roy,Lilly?
lilly,"Tell the doctor I work for Bobo Justus, and this is an emergency. Don't worry, he knows who Bobo is."
roy,"Go away, Lilly. Go away."
doctor," The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do."
lilly,What? He's going to be all right!
doctor,"Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside."
lilly,"Well, make it stop!"
doctor,His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
lilly, You know who I work for.
doctor,"Yes, yes, but that's --"
lilly,"My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed."
clerk, Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
lilly,Roy? He's always crying.
clerk," The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different."
lilly," I like you, too."
clerk,"Roy, your mother's here."
lilly,So what's your story today?
roy,They twisted my arm.
lilly, Only one arm?
roy,They knocked out my tooth!
lilly,Only one tooth?
roy,You always say that!
lilly,"Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house."
clerk, Hah.
lilly,Yes. I imagine you're lots of people's friend.
myra,"Oh, of course, now that I see you in the light, you're plenty old enough to be Roy's mother."
lilly, Aren't we all?
roy, Play nice. Don't fight.
myra,Darling!
lilly,Roy. You're going to be all right.
roy,"Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?"
lilly,I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
roy, What am I doing in here?
myra,"You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?"
roy,"You called the doctor, huh?"
myra," Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you."
roy, How long do they say I'm in here?
myra,Roy... Your mom saved your life.
roy,Yeah? Only one life?
lilly,Second time I gave it to you.
roy,I was kind of... inconvenient... for Lilly.
lilly,"Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track."
roy," Thanks, uh, Lilly."
lilly, Don't mention it.
roy,I guess I owe you my life.
lilly, You always did.
myra,"""Down to the track?"""
roy,Her job.
myra, I want to know everything about you.
roy," You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts."
myra," You heard the shower, didn't you?"
manager,"I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent."
myra,"Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --"
manager,"It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money."
myra,"Joe, you know you'll --"
myra,"Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?"
manager,"My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting."
myra,I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
manager, This time...
myra,"We'll work something out, Joe."
myra,I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
roy,"I just do what the doctor says, babe."
myra,"You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you."
roy, Mama!
myra,"Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you."
roy," I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that."
myra,"I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks."
roy,That's just Lilly's way.
myra,And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
roy,"Oh, don't be stupid."
myra,"You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth."
roy,Are you kid --? I hadn't even seen her in seven years!
lilly,Should my ears be burning?
myra, They might as well.
lilly,I heard those skirts were coming back.
myra,Get well soon.
roy, Every day in every way.
myra,I'll see you when you get home.
roy,What happened to your hand?
lilly," Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them."
roy,"I can take care of my own bills, Lilly."
lilly," Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?"
roy,What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
lilly,"Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?"
roy," It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself."
lilly,And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
roy,I like those.
lilly,"You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!"
roy, You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
lilly,"That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --"
roy,How come?
lilly,You aren't tough enough.
roy,"Not as tough as you, huh?"
lilly, No. And you have to be.
lilly,You asked me about this. You really want to know what happened?
roy,Up to you.
lilly,"My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down."
roy,Sure.
lilly,"The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be."
lilly,"That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out."
roy,Bluebell came in?
lilly,"I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me.  It didn't."
lilly,"Hi, Bobo."
bobo,"Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?"
lilly,"Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for."
bobo,"You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando."
bobo,Bluebell.
bobo,How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
lilly,"I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo."
bobo,"You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?"
lilly,"I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--"
bobo,"One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?"
lilly,I want to keep my teeth.
bobo,"Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!"
lilly," Bobo, no, I --"
bobo,You wanna talk to me straight up?
lilly,My son --
bobo,Your what?
lilly,My son was in the hospital --
bobo,What the fuck are you doin with a son?
lilly,"He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick."
bobo, Motherhood.
lilly,"I never fucked up before, Bobo."
bobo,You expect me to buy this?
lilly,"You do buy it, Bobo. I cost you, and I'm sorry."
bobo,"I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this."
lilly, It'll never happen again. I swear.
bobo,"It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it."
lilly,You're calling the shots.
bobo,You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
lilly, No.
bobo, I'll loan you a raincoat.
bobo, Take a walk.
lilly,"You mean, the insurance frammis?"
bobo,"Tell me about the oranges, Lilly."
lilly,"You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies."
lilly,"It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh..."
bobo," What's that, Lilly?"
lilly,Permanent damage.
bobo,Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
bobo,You want a drink?
lilly,He's a good kid. A salesman.
lilly,From you? My folks didn't raise any stupid kids.
lilly,"Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice."
bobo," That's right. Take a little, leave a little."
bobo, You're a thousand percent right!
lilly,"You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller."
bobo, Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
lilly,"Lucky! Lucky! Oh, am I lucky.! Am I lucky!"
lilly, He let me live. He let me be his friend.
lilly,"You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?"
lilly," Get off the grift, Roy."
roy, That's right.
simms,"Your difference between your folded towel and your clean towel is a trip to the laundry. When you're cleaning those bathrooms, what you do, you pick up the towel, you give it a good shake and a good look, and you say to yourself, 'Would I dry myself on this towel?' If the answer's yes, fold it."
simms,"Mr. Dillon! Welcome back! You look fine, just fine."
simms,"You're well liked around here, Mr. Dillon. The entire staff will be pleased to see you're back."
simms,"We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves."
simms,Happy to see you looking so good.
roy, Whadaya say?
kaggs, Hello.
roy, What's going on? This is usually coffee break time.
roy," Hey, yeah, I'm fine, everything's great. What's this Kaggs? Sounds like a disease."
roy, You think he'll chop me?
clerk,"If he does, he's crazy."
kaggs,Kaggs. Home office.
roy, Roy Dillon.
kaggs," I know that. Knew it when I saw you out there. The best salesman here, which isn't saying much. Want to talk to you, Dillon."
kaggs, You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
kaggs,"I don't know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. The idea is, we'll top it by fifteen percent."
kaggs, No?
roy, Well...
roy," Oh, sure. Fine."
roy, Perk.
myra,I don't see why we have to take the train.
myra,What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
roy,We'll rent a car.
myra,Big spender.
roy,You ain't seen nothin.
roy,Stretch my legs. Come along?
myra,No.
roy, See you soon.
soldier,"That's okay, don't worry about it."
soldier 2,"You okay, pal?"
roy,Let me buy you a new round.
soldier,"Hey, no, no problem."
soldier 3,You didn't like spill much at all.
soldier 3," Yeah, but it was you like told the sergeant your grandmother was dead."
soldier, Again!
soldier 2," I'll drive him, Sarge, he's too distraught."
soldier 4, Distraught? You said distraught?
roy,Boy! You guys could've got in a lot of trouble.
soldier 3,"Nah. Old Sarge, he's slowing down."
roy,I don't know. I wouldn't take a chance like that.  What's that?
soldier 2,You can't buy every round!
lilly,Go away.
lilly,Your pal wants you.
drunk,Let him find his own pretty woman.
waitress,"This fellow bothering you, Ma'am?"
lilly,Yes.
waitress, Why don't you go sit down?
drunk,I'll sit here. Move over.
lilly,Oh! Are you all right?
lilly, I thought I did. You should take better care of your friend.
drunk, Outta here.
myra, I'll sign that affidavit.
roy,"Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work."
myra,You already went back to work.
roy, What?
myra, I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
roy, Working the what?
myra,"Oh, come on, Roy."
myra,The tap. What you do for a living.
roy,I'm a salesman.
myra,You're on the grift. Same as me.
roy," Myra, I'm not following this."
myra," Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like I'm another square."
roy, Nobody does that single-o.
roy, Is that right?
myra," It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game."
cole, I see you brought a friend.
myra," Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!"
cole," Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely."
myra, Goody!
cole, Mary Beth! This has never been anything but --
cole,"Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already..."
myra, So here we are!
cole," Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken."
hebbing," Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?"
cole, And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
hebbing, I certainly hope not.
hebbing,"I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes."
hebbing,"One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?"
cole,"You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?"
hebbing,"I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried."
cole,You brought a case? Good.
man,Hold it right there!
cole, What? This is a private office!
man,"FBI! Stock fraud, tampering with Exchange communications --"
cole,"Oh, my God! No! The scandal!"
second man,Your name?
hebbing,My --? I don't I only --
cole, You! You and your goddamn big mouth!
kyra," Henry, no, I --"
cole,Who did you tell? Who?
myra,"Just one or two of the girls, just, they wouldn't --"
man,"Mister Fellowes, that isn't going to do you any good. Put that down, and --"
myra, He retired.
myra,Atascadero.
myra,"No, baby. Not again."
cole,It's hollow. You'll fall through.
myra,"Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?"
cole,It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
myra," Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?"
roy, Sure.
myra, See you later.
roy, Things a man isn't supposed to know.
myra," You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out."
myra," I hope you don't mind, sir. I just washed my clothes, and I couldn't do a thing with them."
myra," If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!"
roy, Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
lilly,"If you come out to the track, don't know me."
roy,We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
lilly,What's that?
roy,Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
lilly," Roy, I don't want money from you."
roy,I pay my debts.
lilly, You do?
roy,Expecting visitors?
lilly,No. That was the point.
lilly,"No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air."
lilly,I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
lilly,"You, too, Roy."
driver,Here he comes.
myra,I see him.
driver,That's the guy we're following.
myra,Just wait.
driver,You're the boss.
blonde,You stay down real good.
roy,One of my talents.
roy,Naughty.
roy,You were gone for a while.
myra, I went out to Delmar.
roy, The track? Did you run into Lilly?
roy,"She didn't see you, in other words."
roy, You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
myra," You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy."
roy,Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
roy, Yes or no. They're both easier at home. Okay?
kaggs," Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too."
roy,Don't I get any say in this?
roy, That's what I say.
myra, What?
roy, What?
roy," Well, that's good news."
lilly, Roy?
thug,Somebody spooked her.
second thug,White Chrysler.
thug,Full of cash.
roy," Thanks a lot, Lilly."
clerk,Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
lilly,"I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night."
clerk, Those trucks. I know exactly what you mean.
lilly,"Do you have something around back, facing away from the road?"
clerk,I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
lilly,Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
lilly,And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
pierson," A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me."
roy," Yes, I know, I know."
pierson," Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun."
roy, What?
roy, Ate the gun. Oh.
roy," Well, let's get the shock over with."
roy," Oh, yeah. That's that."
simms,"The last modern thing I liked was the miniskirt. Your technology, now, nobody understands it, and that's the simple fact of the situation."
simms," Evening, Mizz Langley!"
simms,"New things come in here all the time, how do they work? You can ask your Ph.Ds, your highly educated, intelligent, professional people, you can say to them, how does that work, and you know what they'll tell you? You plug it in. And that's the way the donut dunks."
lilly,Oh! Roy! You scared me.
roy,Going somewhere?
lilly,"Somewhere else, that's for sure."
roy,I just came back from Phoenix.
roy,"Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it."
roy,"You're dead, Lilly, it worked."
lilly,Just for a minute.
lilly,She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
roy, No.
lilly,"No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?"
lilly, As though you do what I say.
roy," That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix?"
lilly,"Roy, it was terrible. You read about people killing people and all that, but when it happens, my God."
lilly,"She was in her nightgown, you know, the old grifter's dodge, nightgown and the Ice bucket and she just got into the wrong room by mistake."
lilly,"I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --"
roy,Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
lilly,"I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead."
lilly,Just a few bucks.
lilly, Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
lilly,At what?
lilly," Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there."
lilly, What?
lilly," Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --"
roy,"I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --"
roy,No.
lilly,You want a drink?
roy,"Yeah, sure, that sounds nice."
lilly,I'll get it.
roy," Oh, you'll live, Lilly."
lilly," Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid."
roy, Not very good!
roy, Uh-huh.
roy, Never.
lilly, I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
roy, No.
lilly,You're getting off the grift?
lilly,"That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know."
lilly,"If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?"
lilly,"Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him."
lilly,"Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different."
roy,"Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out."
lilly," And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game."
roy," Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly."
