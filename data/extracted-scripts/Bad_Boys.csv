rear,"Where the rest of the gang waits.      NOAH, KUNI, FERGUSON, and CASPER. All dressed in black      like Fouchet, except for ANDY. He stands and shows off      his Miami PD uniform. His English is poor, yet he's got     a big, happy-to-be- along grin on his face. ANDY How do I look? Like the real thing, yeah? FOUCHET Step back and lemme get a good look at you."
3.,"A7   CONTINUED:                                                  A7 BURNETT No chest hair. And packin'. DESK MANAGER I'm sorry.   But our guest list is private. LOWREY Oh, didn't they say? There's going to be party! It's B.Y.O.B.O. --  The B.O. stands for baby oil. BURNETT Maybe you can come. Get off after you get off? All three of them laugh. DESK MANAGER Well, now that you mention it."
4.,"B8   BEDROOM                                                      B8 Lowrey tackles the first dealer to the floor. A LATINA girl screams. Lowrey unfortunately looks and takes a hard fist across the ear from the dealer. Angered, Lowrey swings his pistol up underneath the perp's jaw and knocks him through the bathroom door. Lowrey cuffs him to the sink. Meanwhile... Back to:"
burnett, Nice backup. LOWREY What? We TILT UP as POLICE HELICOPTER flies overhead.
5.,11   EXT. MIAMI'S OLDEST POLICE STATION  - NIGHT       11 The HELICOPTER ROARS low over the rooftops toward the causeway bridge.
6.,"17   EXT. POLICE STATION - ALLEY - NIGHT                           17 Kuni finds the conduit he's looking for, splices it, cuts into it with a Makita battery-powered circular saw, then attaches a handheld high-8 video machine and starts the video feed. The unit is strapped to the conduit."
fouchet,"Then do him, now!"
7.,"23   INT. POLICE STATION - QUICK SHOTS - FERGUSON - NIGHT        23 One by one he moves backwards through the various levels of locks, torching each to look as if they'd entered the evidence room from inside the PD station. Meanwhile --"
theresa,"Quincy, never-you-mind. And take those things off in the house! Jill, stop with the book and eat your breakfast. "
theresa,"I don't want him knowing about it either! Gives him ideas.  'Scuse me, Captain. I think you mean to say, 'Get the fuck down here, please?' Burnett automatically pulls on his jacket, hugs the children as Lowrey hangs up."
theresa,"Not so fast. You were going to take the kids to school today, remember, hon? I have a job interview... Lowrey rolls his eyes."
13.,"40   CONTINUED:                                                 40 INTRO - SANCHEZ AND RUIZ SANCHEZ Let's see. There's Sleepy, Grumpy, Sneezy, Happy, Bashful... Now, who could we be missin'? RUIZ Could it be... Dopey? Both laugh hysterically, while: LOWREY If it ain't the leftovers from Miami Vice. Fashion casualties, lost somewhere in the eighties. BURNETT And the women really go for that. Really, they do. As Burnett and Lowrey duck the tape, they note a very groggy O'Fee over in the corner being attended by a paramedic team. He's still out cold. An oh shit look passes between the two partners."
burnett,Because maybe this guy knows if you kill a cop the whole department'll get up his ass hard and fast. SINCLAIR And who knows that better than anybody else? Cops. BURNETT You're not sayin' this was an inside job. Cops wouldn't pull this shit. 
burnett,What about the air conditioning? HOWARD So what about it? BURNETT 
16.,"42   INT. HEROIN LOCKER - INSIDE SHAFT - BURNETT                42 Burnett crawls up with some help from Lowrey below, stalling the oscillating fan with his cuffs and crawling through. The first thing Burnett notices are the track marks from the bobsled cutting through a coating of dust. LOWREY Anything? BURNETT Yeah. I got some weird track marks in here. Then Burnett notes a manufacturing stamp at the joint. It reads: ORONA AIR CONTITIONING SYSTEMS, INC."
lowrey,"Sorry to come around only when I need something. MAX Forget about it. I owe you the rest of my life, Mike. Lowrey just gives her an ""oh please"" look. MAX Don't be lookin' at me like I'm getting all sentimental. LOWREY Hey, I didn't open my mouth. Listen, there's some major, major ill shit happening down at the P.D. Lotta heroin involved. There's gonna be a lotta cash involved, too. Gonna be some happy motherfuckers around that wanna party. MAX So you want me to check around? LOWREY Just make a coupla calls. See what's what. Don't be doin' no wild shit. Just call me if you hear something."
lowrey,"The air conditioning business has been good to Orona. Lowrey rings the bell.   They wait.   No answer. BURNETT Well, we can leave a note or we can break and enter -- LOWREY Wait. Hear that? I thought I heard Orona beating his wife."
lowrey, Jai-Alai. Dog track. Lotta bookies. Phone numbers. BURNETT Lemme guess. Guy does the air conditioning contract for the P.D. He'd have the plans. LOWREY He trades the plans for his paper and gets popped by the perps. BURNETT Works for me. Now can we go? I'm gonna puke.
lois,"Matronly, in her flowered dress and bare feet, she carries a tea tray toward the kitchen. Max is following. "
max,"It's a favor for a friend. If it sucks after a half-hour, we'll split and head to South Beach. JULIE A favor? MAX You know, my friend Mike Lowrey. JULIE  Mike Lowrey. Not again. Will you just have sex with the man and get it over with. MAX He's just a friend. JULIE Yeah, right.     You're in love. MAX It's never gonna happen. I'm great at turning lovers into friends. But turning friends into lovers, I can't do. JULIE Well, I don't date cops. They never have enough money and they're always too tired to screw. MAX Well, I've told you before, my Mike isn't like that. If I were in real trouble, Mike Lowrey is the only person I'd call."
26.,59   CONTINUED:                                                 59 EDDIE No. Don't go yet. We can party. Just us three. Look at what Eddie's got to play with. From underneath the couch Eddie reveals a single key of heroin. Max tries to hide the recognition that she just hit paydirt on the very first try.
max,"My name's Max.  I'm just a friend. FOUCHET I could use a friend who looks like you. Turn around. Lemme get a good look. Max tries to size this man, then chooses to submit. She does her best model's turn. Slowly giving him a view of the rear when -- Fouchet draws a PISTOL -- BAM BAM!! Max tumbles forward and CRASHES through a GLASS TABLE."
27.,63   INT. BATHROOM - JULIE                                         63 Instant horror. Julie saw Max killed and retreats to the opposite side of the bathroom in total fright. CUT BACK TO:
28.,"65   INT. BATHROOM - JULIE                                      65 Half-panicked, half-trying to keep her head. There's no way out of the bathroom. All she can do is switch off the light. And now she sees Casper's shadow as he approaches."
fouchet,"Wheels with his PISTOL, unloads the clip. BULLETS are catching up, ripping up the couch and the rest of the suite. Julie dives right into the secret door."
29.,70   CONTINUED:                                                 70 She weighs the options.   Jump or die.
30.,"75   CONTINUED:                                                  75 On the far side of the commotion, the two bodies have been photographed and are covered. Chief Howard is conferring with a technician who's dusting for prints."
burnett,Looks like you're already doing that. Burnett's quick to point out the trail of bloody foot- prints Ruiz just tracked across the carpet.
burnett,"He drops the sheet on Eddie's body, then moves over to Max's. He doesn't know it's her until -- BURNETT Jesus, no... LOWREY Whatcha got? "
31.,"75   CONTINUED:                                                75 Burnett drops the sheet, turns and puts a protective shoulder between Lowrey and the body. LOWREY What?     Who is it? Lowrey instintively pushes past his partner and kneels at the body. He pulls back the sheet. Right now he could kill the shooter, then himself. In that order. Lowrey's eyes well up. LOWREY I shoulda told you to be careful."
32.,"77   CONTINUED:                                                   77 LOWREY Three calls to Lois Fields. I'm going to stop by her place and tell her a bedtime story. You can catch a ride with Howard. Lowrey jumps in the car. BURNETT Uh oh... Alright, you check out Lois, then check in --"
36.,87   CONTINUED:                                                 87 JULIE I don't want to come downtown! I don't want police protection! If you can't gimme Detective Lowrey I'm just gonna blow town! INTERCUT WITH:
burnett," Hey, lady. You called me, remember...? 'On the mike with Mike.' After a beat, the door swings ajar."
burnett,"I'm undercover. She doesn't believe him and swings the bat. BURNETT Okay.    I'm way undercover. JULIE Prove it! BURNETT I knew her from way back. From time to time, you know... We'd get together. Mess around, you know? JULIE Wrong. Julie swings for real, nearly taking Burnett's head off."
burnett,"Okay. Okay. So I exaggerated. It's a man thing. She swings again, but he's had enough, he moves quickly, catching the bat with his hand and ripping it away from her. BURNETT You know what? You don't wanna believe me? That's fine with me! Go it alone. Burnett heads toward the open door.     Julie's veneer drops as she shrinks to the floor. "
burnett,"Good.     You got a back door? Julie nods, scoops up one of her dogs and grabbing another modeling bag off the table. JULIE Where are we going? "
burnett,"Let's go! JULIE Luke?!   Where's my other dog?! BURNETT Fuck the dog! Burnett sees the second dog cowering in the corner.       So he lunges over, scoops the dog up. CUT TO:"
julie,"All I remember is one of them had really bad hair. Where are we going? BURNETT I told you, I'm putting you into protective custody... JULIE "
42.,98    CONTINUED:                                                  98 JULIE Wrong? BURNETT I mean right. As in good. My place is good. We'll go there first.  My place.
chet,"Didn't mention it to me. Chet holds out his hand. Burnett slips him ten. Chet sneaks a peek over at the car, sees Julie putting on lipstick. CHET Say.   How's that Mrs. Burnett? Burnett realizes this is going to cost him more. Gives him another ten. But for Chet it's still not enough. CHET Your children good? Mr. Lowrey says you got a regular baby factory goin' over there. "
43.,"101   CONTINUED:                                                   101 BURNETT  Here. And if that's not enough, I'm gonna run you in for extortion. CHET Now that I think about it, Mr. Lowrey did mention something about giving you the key."
burnett,"I forgot I had those switches moved. Welcome to Casa del Lowrey. Julie enters, looking left and right, cautious but impressed by the stylish digs. JULIE Nice... very nice. All this on a cop's salary? BURNETT I uh... I invest. JULIE Right. What was your last pick? A horse in the number two race at Pimlico? Or did a bookie give you an inside tip."
44.,"102   CONTINUED:                                               102 BURNETT Fair enough. I'm not on the take. Satisfied? Good. So... why don't you make yourself at home? Here's the T.V. remote. Watch yourself some 'Gilligan's Island' reruns or somethin'. Hits ""ON"" button. Instead of TV, the room immediately becomes a seduction den: lights dim, romantic music. BURNETT Heh -- all these damn things look alike. "
45.,"102   CONTINUED:    Miiike... it's Yvette... I know I told you I don't date cops. And I know I told you I wouldn't sleep with a man I wasn't going to marry. But I've been thinking -- and I remember when you said thinking was a dangerous thing -- so I started feeling... well, lonely. Remember when you gave me that key -- Burnett charges over and shuts OFF the MACHINE. BURNETT It's uh... It's uh... JULIE You don't have to explain. Finally, they've reached consensus.     Burnett grins and is out the door. BURNETT Lock the door. Don't open it for anybody."
burnett,"-- I swear, baby, it's nothing. I was on the job -- As she gets to the bedroom, Doris wheels around -- DORIS And you just happened to lose your wedding ring -- 'on the job?!' He looks down at his ringless finger -- BURNETT No!   No!    I got it right here... "
47.,"105   CONTINUED:                                                 105 BURNETT If you were a real partner, instead of some no-backup, hot doggin', car chasin', skirt sniffin' motherfucker, I would be gettin' down to business with my wife instead of stuck in this situation. LOWREY Yeah.   Thanks for the get-well card."
48.,"106   CONTINUED:                                                 106 LOWREY Dogs, too? I got Persian rugs, man. I'm going home... explain the whole thing, take her to the Motel Six, she'll understand... HOWARD Not a good idea. "
on fouchet,"He's dealing with his 26-year-old chemist named ELLIOT. FOUCHET Okay. Explain it to me, Elliot. Why are we behind? ELLIOT The cutting agent is highly volatile. You can't cook it like you would a pizza. I had to gear the ovens down to half-speed. FOUCHET We already accounted for that, Elliot. It's in our fucking timetable. So what else?  Elliot is uncomfortable. He looks back at WALLY, his stoned-looking assistant, before forging ahead. ELLIOT There's too much moisture down here. The pies are taking longer to cook than we originally planned. WALLY Yeah.   It's totally fucked. FOUCHET You.  Shut up.  Noah?! Bring me something for my stomach! A fuckin' Snapple or somethin'."
julie,"The guy who killed Max. Now, he was looking for the heroin that Eddie stole from him... Max went to the party as a favor to you. You're a dope cop, right? BURNETT Special Narcotics Division. JULIE So this isn't about Max's death at all. It's about dope. BURNETT We find the dope, we find our shooter, too. JULIE There's some powder in there, too. Can you hand that to me?  Mike? Mike? Burnett has disappeared into... TIME CUT TO:"
burnett,"It's a good thing that I'm secure in my manhood to see that you don't mean that. You know how many women I've had in that waterbed? Check the waves as they go by. Count 'em.  Now, mug shots?"
55.,118   CONTINUED:                                                 118 BURNETT The shooter said four days until he makes the deal. What else did he say? JULIE Somethin' weird. Sounded like three angels... He wasn't worried because he had three little angels on his shoulders tellin' him something. I didn't get the rest.  I'm getting tired of looking at ugly people.
burnett,"Just a few more and we can take another break. JULIE I don't wanna take a break. Then we'd have to talk and I got nothing to say to a cannibal. BURNETT A what? JULIE That was a living, breathing consciousness. It felt joy. Sadness. Maybe it even had a name. BURNETT What had a name."
julie,That flesh you're shoveling into your mouth. BURNETT 
56.,118   CONTINUED:     Let's look at some more ugly people.
julie,Wait. Hold it. Go back... That's him! That's one of 'em. BURNETT You sure? Julie nods.    She's certain.
julie," I had a little accident. BURNETT This is my favorite shirt.   My lucky shirt. JULIE Sorry. As Burnett starts to walk away... JULIE Listen, Mike. I don't have any of my clothes. I wanna go back to my place to get some. BURNETT Not going to happen."
julie,"I need apparel. That and I need some food that's something more than a cold, slab of fear. BURNETT Slab of fear? JULIE All you got in the place are frozen steaks. BURNETT Alright. I left my wallet at the office so I'll give you some cash tomorrow."
theresa,"Standing in the doorway.   Hands on her hips. LOWREY Oh, hi, Theresa. Just tellin' the kids about -- THERESA Thank you, but I'll tuck the kids in. Say good night to Uncle Mike. QUINCY But we want to hear the rest of the story... Theresa silences Quincy with a look.   Sensing his cue, Lowrey kisses the kids."
lowrey,"G'night, gang. QUINCY AND JILL G'night, Uncle Mike."
lowrey,"Just a harmless bedtime story. Thought the kids deserved to know about the hero they have for a dad. THERESA We don't need any violence in this household and we certainly don't need any more heroes. What we need is a father and a husband. LOWREY Husband? Theresa. He's your personal errand boy. You beep the poor S.O.B. every hour on the Goddamn hour? And why is it always about some useless bullshit that can wait until later. I mean, the guy's gotta job to do. THERESA You wanna know why I page him? Because until that phone rings, I don't know whether he's dead or alive. And lemme tell you. Those three minutes I'm waiting for him to call back? Those are the hardest three minutes for a cop's wife. LOWREY "
lowrey,"You should recognize trunk. It's the one you came to America in. RUIZ You don't come from Cuba by car, asshole. Lowrey walks by his own cherished Porsche on the way in."
lowrey,"You know, it is a damn shame she makes you buy this stuff. BURNETT Hey, this what husband's do. LOWREY Terrible fuckin' job. "
63.,132   EXT. GRUNGY TRAILER PARK - DAY                              132 Burnett and Lowrey park and pop the trunk.    Inside are guns and uniforms. BURNETT What are we gonna be today? Postal Inspectors or Water and Power? LOWREY Water and Power.
burnett,"It's me, Julie... Julie enters from the bedroom, dressed in something hot with the tag still hanging from a sleeve. JULIE I'll be ready in just a minute. I thought I'd have you tell -- She stalls at the sight of Lowrey, a little spark of interest passes between them. JULIE Hi. I'm Julie. You must be Marcus. "
burnett,What? LOWREY No. It's not my place. My wife. She's a designer. She decorated the whole place at a discount just for Mike. And when she hears about how he's been taking care of --  Off the couch! Lowrey chases the dogs into the bedroom. One of the dogs runs out with a Cole Hahn loafer in his mouth. They both follow him into the bedroom.
woman,"Yvette! BURNETT You don't quit stalking me, Yvette, I'm gonna place your ass under arrest! -- 'Bye! Burnett slams the door. She's SCREAMING on the other side, POUNDING the door with her fists, and cursing in mad Spanish. Finally she stomps off down the hall. LOWREY 'The hell's going on out here?? "
julie," So, Mike. Any other spontaneous naked women with keys, that we should know about? BURNETT We, as in Marcus and I, are going to Club Hell. We're gonna nail this Noah guy and get him to give up Max's shooter. Anyone got a problem with that? JULIE I feel safer now. She turns and exits back into the bedroom. Burnett's about to follow when Lowrey swings him outside the door- way and gets into his face. LOWREY You are ruining my life! BURNETT Yeah, well this case is messin' with mine, too."
julie,Three little angels! The guy who killed Max said 'three little -- Julie sees Noah and freezes. LOWREY The music's too loud.    What you say about angels? Noah closes the gap.    Through the crowd he draws down on Lowrey.
lowrey,"Launches himself off a nearby table, soars over the frightened crowd and comes crashing down upon Noah. Both Lowrey and Noah tumble to the floor. Noah's gun skitters into the crowd. Noah chases for it, but can't find it. But --"
julie,as she grabs Lowrey. JULIE That's him! LOWREY No shit!
noah,"His wheels catch the island and the snaps, and rolls right into --"
burnett,There goes our only lead to the dope. We better call Howard. JULIE That's it. That's it.   You're both crazy. Julie takes a few steps away before she decides to give them the other barrel. JULIE Protect and serve. Sound familiar? Isn't that what you're supposed to do? 'Cuz I'd like to know whose butt you're protecting. 
burnett,Yeah... I feel a little funny. JULIE Not that kind of funny. BURNETT What kind of funny? JULIE You know...  Funny. BURNETT I gotta call Marcus. Burnett's out of bed like a shot and headed for the living room.
kids,"G'night, Uncle Mike. THERESA Yeah.   Good night, Uncle Mike. LOWREY G'night, everybody. Lowrey's at the window. Parked just down the street is the same sedan. He goes for the phone and dials. Waits for an answer. LOWREY Hey, Sanchez. It's me Lowrey... Yeah? Same to you, pal. But listen. I got something you'll want a piece of."
theresa,"Mike! In a heartbeat, Lowrey charges into Theresa's room in his underwear. LOWREY What's the matter? THERESA I heard a noise... I think someone's outside..."
lowrey's gun,"Tumbles into the flower bed. Lowrey reels with     an elbow, dropping Burnett to the lawn. But Burnett rolls     and clips Lowrey's legs. Lowrey falls. Crawls for      his gun. Gets hold of it, turns and is ready to fire when    --"
car,"drives past.   The headlights, revealing Burnett. LOWREY Marcus!   What the fuck -- BURNETT ... You doin' Theresa?    Theresa! LOWREY What?   Me and Theresa? BURNETT I hope you used protection... 'cause I don't want a fourth kid that looks like you! "
lowrey,This whole deal has turned you stupid. You're seeing things that aren't there. 
burnett,"Yeah, I wouldn't want to spoil your little arrangement! LOWREY And where's Julie? You didn't leave her again. BURNETT She's in the car. Got her cuffed to the steering wheel. Lowrey could kill now. He's on his feet, grabbing Burnett by the collar and shoving him up against the front door. LOWREY "
86.,"201    CONTINUED:                                                  201 Lowrey holds and watches Burnett run off to the Porsche, keeping the sedan in his periphery the entire time. CUT TO:"
casper,Sonofabitch!   There's the girl! But just as they start the car.    KUH-THUNK -- the CAR lurches. FERGUSON What the fuck?
howard's office,Where Ruiz and Sanchez wait with one of last night's Henchmen. His face is horribly bruised.
sanchez,"He says he wants his lawyer. RUIZ Yeah, but we told him we were desperate men without no fuckin' jobs, so...  So? HENCHMAN Okay. All I know is his name. Foo-shay, I think. Got this heavy French accent. The word was he offs drug dealers. And there was quick cash for whoever had the balls enough to hook up with him. I swear, man, watchin' your house was my first gig for the guy."
lowrey,"Or one really smart sonofabitch. HOWARD We're    in the shit, boys. And there    ain't gonna be any more time cards    for this unit unless somebody pulls    a miracle out of their ass."
jojo,"I'm tellin' you straight up, like a straight fuckin' arrow, okay? I'm straight as a board. I'm so straight it's fuckin' sick. BURNETT Now there's a lotta dope, Jojo. Who can cut it quick? JOJO You mean, cut it... cut it up, yeah. I don't know anything about anything. Lowrey's had it.   He pulls his gun and pushes in. "
lowrey,Excuse me. One moment. 
95.,215   INT. STAKEOUT CAR - DAWN                                    215 BURNETT Let's just hope he didn't come home for a nap. TIME CUT TO:
lowrey,"I'm on him.  Hey, buckle up back there. JULIE Wha...? Lowrey has the keys in the ignition and is stomping on the gas."
julie,What? LOWREY Mike's place.     I said Mike's. Lowrey rolls his eyes.    He can't wait for this to end.
julie,"So, I guess when you get back, it's gonna be over. LOWREY That's the plan... So, Mike. Loan some of those ass kicking clothes. BURNETT Third drawer down.  Hey, Julie. Do me a favor and see who that is."
lowrey,"Mike what?     What'd he do? BURNETT Theresa.     It's not how it looks. THERESA It ain't Cleveland, neither. LOWREY Where's Julie? Lowrey pushes past Theresa into --"
julie,"Wait. I know why. Because you said you needed me. Jesus, who's the stupid one now? LOWREY We still need you. He reaches for her. JULIE Fuck you! Julie slams a fist into Lowrey's face. The elevator doors shut. Then Burnett comes hauling down the corridor with Theresa at his heels. He pounds the elevator button. THERESA You stayed away from home just one night too many, Marcus. BURNETT Theresa. She's a material witness! It was orders!"
fouchet,"enters, with Casper and Ferguson to either side. "
burnett,"Pushes Theresa back into the elevator, making her lay on the floor as BULLETS CUT above."
lowrey,Slips behind a pillar as BULLETS WHIZ past.
julie,On floor.    In the middle.   Crawling for cover when --
fouchet,"With balls the size of Pennsylvania. Two GUNS in hand, walks forward with barrels fixed and FIRING. Clips out on one, tosses the gun aside, then, with his free hand, reaches down and grabs Julie by the hair and lifts her until she stands. FOUCHET Let's go! "
lowrey,"Swings around the pillar, gun leveled and running after them. LOWREY Julie!!!! Meanwhile --"
lowrey,"enters. He dives to the floor as Casper stops and FIRES. BULLETS RIP through the salon walls and mirrors. Lowrey ends up under an old lady's dress.  239   EXT. OCEAN BLVD.                            239 Exiting the beauty salon and stumbling through a crowded cafe runs Fouchet and the gang, mauling their way through tables and patrons. Lowrey, only moments behind, pushing his way through the same path.  103. 240   EXT. INTERSECTION                                          240 Fouchet stops right in the middle. Picks the first car that's headed for him. Levels a GUN on a taxi cab and FIRES two quick rounds -- BAM BAM!! The driver of the car instantly slumps. Ferguson's seen this before. He's around to the driver's side of the car, pulling the dead man out and leaving him on the street. Casper and Fouchet shove Julie inside and they're off again.  241   EXT. INTERSECTION                                          241 But here comes Burnett. Crossing traffic. He's got no gun. So he jumps aboard Fouchet's car just as it gets into gear. The WHEELS SPIN.
