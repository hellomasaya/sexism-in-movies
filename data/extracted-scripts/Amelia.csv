Speaker,Dialogue
amelia,"Adventurous? You've got the wrong girl, Mister. You should know that by now. Her eyes study him.    Assessing something as he pours himself four fingers."
fred,Actually. I knew that the moment I met ol' George. He sips his drink.    She says nothing.
amelia,That why I get so many chances to not do it?
fred,Well.   Natural curiosity. His charming smile. She's thinking more about the tequila. She reaches to take his bottle and glass. Moves them to her side of the table.
fred,"I mean, why would a guy who needs to run the show. Pick the one girl he knew could kick his tail?"
amelia,He thought I hated him.      He never knew I was fascinated.
george, The first time I met her she sat in that chair. The secretary doesn't know whether to write that down.   And still with his back to her...
george,Miss Earhart?
amelia,Mr. Putnam? GEORGE  I asked you to sit.
amelia,"Was that the thing you did with your hand? Sadly, I don't speak dog. His smile now only a trace.       But more genuine."
george,"A            Ah.   Well, stand if you like. melia sits."
amelia,I do.
george,"In the 12 months since Lindbergh, 55 people in 18 planes have tried. Three planes made it. Fourteen people have died."
amelia,I'll make it.
george,"Three women died trying. Two others escaped with their lives. If you do make it, you'd be the first. Which...is the real attraction for both of us, I suspect. She nods.    No smile."
amelia,Always nice to know what the real attraction is. His smile.    Beginning to enjoy this conversation.
george,"The plane was bought from Adm. Byrd by Amy Guest, a socialite who wanted the record for herself. Her family wouldn't tolerate the danger. She has asked for a replacement... He gestures.   Perhaps you."
amelia,Why would that matter?
george,Because she wants the world to pay attention. And pretty girls command more attention.
amelia,Was that your advice?
george,Sure. My role is selling this event to the public. There will be a contract for the girl's story with the New York Times. Also a book to be published over her name. Understood...?       G
amelia,Except for the part that goes to you.
george,"Which will be as great as I can manage, I assure you."
amelia,You said she wants a flyer.
george,Don't get your hopes up. The celebrated Wilmer Stultz will be the pilot. There'll be a male co- pilot and navigator. The woman will be purely a passenger.
amelia,Why would anyone want a book from a passenger?
george,"Because the hook is that we're making the woman the commander. The pilot will sign a contract saying he is under her direction and control. It's her ship, her flight."
amelia,"Good for my chances, you said. What are my chan..."
george,The job's yours. She blinks.   Stunned speechless.
amelia,"You're a busy man, Mr. Putnam.     I can find my way. The look holds.   He shrugs.   You probably can."
george,I honestly feel an apology is in order.
amelia,Fine.   What have I done? She watches his smile.
george,I mean an apology.   For what's coming. His voice softens.
amelia,We.
george,"That's right. If you're not in there selling with me, it won't work. The smile turns friendly."
amelia,Spoken like a gentleman. She steps up onto the train. Extends her hand like a man. He shakes it firmly. The train begins to move. She watches his cheery wave as she rolls away.
amelia,Got it.   I think.
melia,"Girls, this is Mr. Samuel Chapman. Sam, say hullo to the Octopus Club. The Octopus Club waves to Sam.   The adults wave, too."
amelia,"They are, actually. She pats the grass beside her.   Sam has no choice but to sit."
sam,And it's a secret.
amelia,"Has to be. Competition, you know. Millionaire heiresses, hot shot girl pilots. If George knew I told you, he'd have me publicly flogged."
sam,And no one else knows.
amelia,Marion. She's giving me a leave of absence.
sam,"I would think so. Your name will be in all the papers, and not just Boston. Denison House stands to come in for funding, national attention."
amelia,Specially if I don't make it.
sam,Don't joke about that. She wasn't joking at all.
amelia,"Well, I'll have impressive credentials as a long-distance passenger. That's not exactly a career in aviation. She looks up at his eyes."
sam,And where does that leave us?
amelia,You do love to look on the dark side. Whatever did you see in a sunny character like me? She gives him a sweet playful smile.   It doesn't reassure him.
sam,It's not as if I'd been putting pressure on you.
amelia,What love means to you. What it requires. Is the pressure. He stops walking.
sam,I love you. Is that such a terrible problem? She gazes at him.   Can he even hear this?
amelia,The problem is what it's always been. The problem is me.
mabel,"Okay, boys. I'll take any questions you wanna throw my way. Except about what's behind this sweater. The boys ROAR.   Mabel keeps her smile tight."
george,"Boys, I'd like to introduce your commander, Miss Amelia Earhart."
amelia,"We felt `commander' was less grandiose than, say, `empress.' Bill doesn't smile.   The other man does..."
george,"Say hello to Slim Gordon your navigator. She is shaking hands in that strong, direct way."
george,"Nope, those are new, personally suggested by the old man himself. Bill nods on that.   Sure were."
amelia,Hmmn.   What does that do to our fuel?
bill,"Costs us at least 400 gallons. Don't bother bringing clothes for Paris, we'll be lucky to hit the nearest beach in Ireland. Real lucky."
george,The Admiral estimates the pontoons only cut our range by 200 miles. But Amelia looks to Bill.   That's not really possible is it?
bill,The Admiral is the Admiral. He gets to estimate any damn thing he wants. All we have to do is figure out how to fly without petrol. She turns to George with challenging eyes.
amelia,I wonder if it can keep them up there. Not that I've ever had enough to try.
amelia,Sorry.    I'll try keeping my mouth shut.
george,What I ought to try. Is listening to you once in awhile.
amelia,"Careful.    I could get to like it. No reaction from him. He hops into the boat. Turns, holds out his hand. She hesitates. Clearly doesn't need his help to jump into a boat. Their eyes lock. We are watching her decide. And then... She reaches to clasp his hand.   Hops down beside him."
george, Simpkin.
amelia,"It's in a book. Oh, that's right. You read the ones you publish. Her smile is friendly, not flirtatious. She goes to sit in the bow. He doesn't follow. But he is watching."
amelia,What are you boys doing over there?
george,"Trying to make you look like a girl. George studies the photo, then goes to Amelia and begins moving her body into the new pose. Tilting her head to Lindbergh's angle."
george,"he more we can make you look like a girl, the better."
amelia,"Oh god, is it worth the effort? He cocks his head, studies her.    Nah, guess not."
george,Wondering who should play you in the film of all this. I'm thinking Chaplin.
amelia,"Valentino's not available? He shakes his head sadly. Adjusts her collar once more. This time, his hands linger."
george,"Amelia Earhart, this is Dorothy Binney Putnam. The women trade smiles.   They shake hands, holding eye contact."
dorothy,"Great to meet you. George talks so much about you.  In fact, lately, you're all he does talk about."
photographer,"Hold those smiles for one more, please."
amelia,"Popping off letters. For my dad, my mom, my sis. You know. In case."
george,I'm honored. That you'd leave these with me.
amelia,"Who else? If I do pop off, it's your fault. Said in her sunny way. But she's not kidding.    It takes a beat before he can offer..."
george,I'll call them once you're safely on your way.
amelia,Sam will handle that.   They trust him. That registers.
george,"I've figured out the Simpkin thing, you know."
amelia,Have you.
george,"Sure. There are so few books I haven't published, it was easy to find. Well...?"
amelia,But why is he you? Oh.
george,"He's brilliant, charismatic..."
amelia,So you haven't actually read it. Do you actually read?
george,"...neurotic, compulsive, manipulative. Am I getting warmer? She sighs."
amelia,"Hi there, boys. How are the ham and eggs? The FLASHES EXPLODE as one.   They keep POPPING as Amelia makes her way to them."
bill,"Don't blame us, lady. I think somebody's starting to sell books. The reporters are handing her their morning editions. The New York Times front page headline: BOSTON GIRL STARTS FOR"
eporter,"Say, Amelia. What have you got for Mabel Boll to chew on?"
amelia,"Now why would a famous gal like Mabel give a thought to someone like me? I don't have a single sweater made out of gold. The boys ROAR, Slim louder than anyone. Even Bill cracks a smile. They're shouting, teasing, YOU CAN'T KID US!"
bill,"The ham's a little tough, Commander. But the bacon's swell."
mabel,"Well, how would any woman feel about some tart who steals her man? Reporters furiously writing, more flashes EXPLODE."
eporter,"Mabel, are you implying Miss Earhart used her feminine charms on your pilot?"
mabel,"I don't know, Charlie, I never seen her. Has she got any? LAUGHTER, they're all calling out.   She shows them a smoky smile, but stays on message."
reporter,What makes you so cocky that she won't leave first?
mabel,"Rusty, we can carry enough fuel to go to China. That thing they're flying can't load enough gas to make Yonkers. Tell that to Putnam's girlie. And while you're at it... She snuggles the gleaming fox fur around her.  MABEL  Tell her I do wear silver.   So I'm two up on her."
bill,"Christ, what time is..."
amelia,"Time to fly. Get up, get dressed, we're going now. She is calm and angry at once.    A powerful combination.   Slim pulls his pants off a chair."
bill,"Where's the weather report? She goes to his bed. Hands him a slip of paper.     He blinks, still waking up. Reads."
amelia,"Great. Maybe Mabel will think so, too. Because if she doesn't, she's going to Paris and you're going home. Today."
ill,It's not good enough.
amelia,"It's fine, there's a tail wind all the way, we'll off-load to 700 gallons, which gets us off the water and the wind gets us to Ireland."
bill,We've had better than this and we haven't gone.
amelia,"But this   is the day Mabel's ready, so we're   going now. The weather is going   to get better and we'll be there   to enjoy it."
bill,You're serious.
amelia,"Just as serious as you're hung over.  You go now, get the late weather, we'll meet you at the plane. Go. Now! Slim pulls on his shoes, grabs his jacket, his bag. Looks to Bill, but the pilot is glaring at his commander."
amelia,"Good.     Slim, start the engines. She still hasn't given the paper to Bill. Slim steps onto a pontoon. Starts CRANKING up the propellers. As the engine KICKS to life..."
bill,Have a nice flight.
amelia,"Thanks. She motions to Slim, get on board. The navigator grins, starts to climb up, looking back at Bill..."
slim,"Hey, I'm scared shitless of this dame. She climbs up after him.   One look back..."
amelia,"Read tomorrow's papers, Bill. We'll both be in them. And disappears. Alone on the dock, Bill hears the engines REV. Jesus, God, she's going to do it. He takes a step toward the plane, but her head appears in the hatch..."
amelia,Out of gas. May have to swim for
bill,Mr. Putnam phoned. He says there's fella coming from London. Hilton Railey.
amelia,"Oh, yeh. Very important man.   More important than any of us. Really?    Yep."
bill,"He says ya mustn't come ashore til he gets here. No matter what. Great.    She doesn't like it, but there it is.   She waves, so long."
amelia,"Public relations. Goes back to work.    DISSOLVE TO... LATER. Amelia sits with her papers in her lap, dangling her feet from the hatch. Alone. Hear the BUZZ of... ...a PLANE dropping slowly from the sky, gliding onto the water on its pontoons. She stares at it. Gathers up her things. LATER. Amelia sitting in a tiny dinghy, behind her the Friendship in distance. She is being rowed to shore. Our VIEW is over the back of the man rowing. Amelia is staring past him, vaguely apprehensive. REVERSE ANGLE. She's looking at TWO THOUSAND WELSHMEN swarming the docks. You can't even see the sand. The crowd is silent and staring. No cheers. As if they were staring at an alien or an animal in the zoo. Bill and Slim help pull the dinghy to the rocky shore. But when Amelia jumps out, the crowd..."
sheriff,Sorry Ma'am. Shoulda brought more men.
amelia,"No, really, this is very sweet, it's an honor. I'm actually enjoying it."
sheriff,That's a good thing. She looks at him as they are jostled along.
amelia,"Hullo, Hilton. Railey stands back as FLASHBULBS catch the moment.   He's brought photographers with him. And more."
ailey,"Amelia, say hullo to Allen Raymond of the New York Times. A hearty handshake.   She holds out her sheets of paper."
amelia,I believe you've come for these. Both men regard the pages as if they were gold bullion.     Come for these indeed.
amelia,I was a passenger on this journey. Just a passenger. Everything that was done to bring us across was done by Wilmer Stultz and Slim Gordon. All the praise...
reporter," But you can fly, can't you? Amelia stares at the man.    Conflicting agendas."
amelia,"This flight was solely to the credit of Bill and Slim. Women should know, however, that I have had 500 hours solo flying and once held the women's altitude record."
reporter,So you could have done it yourself!
amelia,"This particular flight, under these conditions, I wonder if anyone but Bill Stultz could have pulled it off. But certainly, one day a woman will do this. As easily, as skillfully, as professionally as any man. Such calm self-possession.    Such confidence in that."
amelia,Guess you can burn those letters. Dorothy wonders.       Letters?
george,I saved them for your book. One simple shake of Amelia's head.       A soft...
amelia,The book's yours.     The letters are mine. He smiles.       Bows in submission.
george,ou're the boss.
dorothy,"Hey, that's my job.  Do you think there's enough of him to boss for the two of us? Amelia still looking at George.    Laughs."
amelia,Barely enough for one. A battery of reporters and flashbulbs wait by our motorcade.
reporter,"Miss Earhart, can you tell us some- thing about your future plans?"
amelia,"Well, being a social worker by trade and passion, I'll be going back to work at Denison House when all this fun is over. She sends the guy a smile, and a dozen FLASHES catch it."
reporter,"Mr. Putnam, sir. How did a social worker like Miss Earhart become comfortable as a celebrity so quickly? George smiles.   His eyes still following Amelia."
george,"The truth is, she was a celebrity on smaller stages all her life."
george,Lucky Strike endorsement.      I wrote the copy myself.
amelia,What does it say?   `I don't smoke but you should?'
george,It says Lucky Strikes were the only cigarettes aboard the Friendship. That's true.
amelia,True and misleading.      Why would I sign that?
george,So Bill and Slim get paid.
amelia,It's so good to meet you. I've been following your career with a great deal of admiration.
elinor,"Um.   Thanks, and.   You, too."
amelia,Feel like a drink?
george,Amelia!   What would her mother say?
amelia,"Relax, George. I meant a Coke. As she leads Elinor into the sitting room of their suite, the girl's eye falls on the door to the bedroom. It is slightly ajar, revealing an unmade double bed. Unseen by the others, the kid reacts. Oh, my."
elinor,They're saying you get $500 a week on the lecture circuit.
amelia,All depends. On whether you want the sell or the real.
elinor,"Oh, I don't underestimate the value of selling. It's why I'm here."
george,"A 16-year-old girl sets an altitude record, then makes headlines illegally flying under the four bridges of the East River. You don't seem to need much help selling yourself."
elinor,"Well, actually Mr. Putnam, I was hoping you could do to me what you've done to her. Inadvertently, her eyes flick to the bedroom door. Catching this, our couple shares a dry smile. The kid sees that. Uh- oh."
george,"Just so we're clear, young lady. What is your primary ambition? ELINOR  To take Amelia's place as the number one female pilot. The honesty, the suddenness, leave George atypically dumbstruck."
amelia,"Well, good for you! I would have expected nothing less. You want a tip?"
elinor,I do.
amelia,"Keep doing what you're doing. The girl nods, seriously.    Okay."
george,"Lovely party, huh?"
dorothy,Depends on your point of view. I've been listening to some idiot brag about his girlfriend. Still walking.   She never looks at him.
george,"Well, in that case, for your information, it is a lovely party indeed. Anything on your mind?"
dorothy,It's not so much that my husband is having an affair with his meal ticket. It's just a pity we can't have one honest conversation about it.
george,"What's wrong with this one? A promising start, I'd say, in the honesty department. She finishes her drink. Throws the glass away. From our ANGLE we can now see D Amelia in the window, watching them."
orothy,"If this is what you call an honest talk, I'd say you need some practice."
george,"Great. Let's try one about you and Fred Upton. She stops walking.   Turns in shock, to see his easy smile."
george,Dorothy and I are through. She sits beside him.     Very close.
amelia,"For a long, long time."
george,It's different now. She looks at him.   Squints.    How?
amelia,I can't do that.
george,"If you give it a chance, you'll learn to love me. He seems so sunny and strong.     What can he be feeling?"
amelia,"I already love you.    That's why I can't marry you. GEORGE  Well, that explains it. For a minute there, I thought you were stuck for an excuse."
amelia,I know me.     And you don't.   Not really.
george,What if I promise not to learn?
amelia,The day will come. When I will run away. And when it does... He stops her with a kiss.
george,If you love me. I'll take my chances. He stares in her troubled eyes.   There is no answer.
elinor,Wish I was important enough for you to manage.
george,"Well, I've just got one client. And most days she's more than I can manage. Even Elinor's smile seems older, more capable of subtlety."
elinor,Get in line behind the boys she smacked around on the Derby. He grins back.   You bet.
george,And both of those things.      Are the reasons I called you.
elinor,"I'm not sure she has much of a chance, Mr. Putnam."
george,"Well, the one shot would be putting her in a far more powerful plane than anything she's flown. We're thinking the Lockheed Vega. The girl's shock.    He really means this."
elinor,"Sir, I've test piloted the Vega. It's way more than she could ever handle. It wouldn't be safe, let alone successful. He smiles."
george,"That's why I'm thinking of you flying with her. You could handle the cross-country flying, the more difficult bits, and I'd pay you $75 a week. Elinor WHISTLES low."
elinor,"Well, I think that's the most generous opportunity I've ever been offered. He stares at her."
george,"There's just one thing. Obviously, it has to appear that Amelia did all the flying. So when pictures are taken, you'll stand off to one side. Her eyes narrow.    He's completely serious."
elinor,"In that case, I'll get my own plane and win the race myself."
george,You haven't changed.
elinor,That's a threat.
george,"I'm an intensely loyal person, Elinor. And this is what my loyalty requires. She's glaring.   Reeling.   Trapped."
elinor,She's the one who said I shouldn't let anybody turn me around.
george,"She probably meant me. So honest, the words confuse her."
elinor,"Obviously, she doesn't see me as a threat."
george,"Oh, sure she does. A straight smile..."
george,he told you that I shut her out of the Derby. And that's true.
amelia,And when were you going to tell me? GEORGE  Never. I knew you'd go crazy. And I felt it needed to be done. She can scarcely believe this.
amelia,"What? You think I wanted it done, but just let you do the dirty work?"
george,I didn't say that.
amelia,"Because I'm no angel. Business is competition and competition is rough, and I thank my stars that you're there making this life happen for me, but..."
george,ou're making your life hap...
amelia,But this is different. It is.
george,"rom here on, I'll just stab men in he back. A"
melia,"You didn't do this for business, anyway.   G"
eorge,I did it for fun?
amelia,You did it because you love me. That stops him.
george,did.   I do.
amelia,"Well, then. His eyes moving over her face."
george,What about what you said? The day will come when you run away. It will.
amelia,"You'll be destroyed. And part of me will, too. And I think we both know it. And yet."
george,y Amelia. Brutal in her frank- ness. Beautiful in her honesty. He steps to her.    Looks in her eyes.   They kiss.
melia,I might fly to Paris. Silence.
george,Which is actually across the Atlantic.
amelia,"Hence, the article. Ah.   He nods."
george,Not at all. When would you like to go?
amelia,I'm surprised you're all right with this... WIDEN ANGLE.     George kneeling beside her.   Happily planting his own.
george,Really.
amelia,"Mmm-hmmn. I was braced for the lecture. Five years since Lindbergh, no one's made it solo, so many of them died. He looks at her work. Reaches over. Starts packing the earth HARDER around her plant. She just watches, then..."
george,"ell, they were only men.   This is different. She reaches to his plant and starts LOOSENING the soil..."
amelia,"I was waiting to hear that I'm only doing this because I was just a passenger last time, and I'd rather die than go on living as a fraud.. No one cracks a smile. It's like Laurel and Hardy in a food fight where each lets the other take his best shot. George"
george,"Of course not. But if I did... She SMACKS his hand. He just keeps working. She finally grins, smacks him HARDER. He doesn't seem to notice."
george,"Elephant hair, I think you wear it on your toe. It's good luck. He puts it in her hand."
amelia,I think luck has rules. And I try to respect them. My favorite is... She glances up.
george,Do you have money?
amelia,No. He pulls out a twenty dollar bill.      Hands it to her.
eorge,Sure.
amelia,"Thank god, I thought you were going to tear it in half."
george,I spent our money on ocean liner passage to go bring you back. It's non-refundable. So try to do your part. She nods.   She'll try.   He doesn't want to leave her yet.
amelia,"I put it in a letter. Which you'll get if I don't make it. So...mixed emotions, huh? He shakes his head. GEORGE  Either way, something to look forward to. She puts her hands on his face.    She doesn't want to leave him either."
amelia,"Excuse me, sir. Where am I? A blink.   The truth..."
man,In Gallagher's pasture.
amelia,"When I left, I was aiming for Paris. Oh. MAN  It's over there."
george,"ell, I'm glad someone besides me finally noticed. His smile is light.    Her eyes watching him.   Then... AMELIA  `Using a man-made perfect machine, tuned by men mechanics, trained by men flyers, on a course laid out by a man. By a lucky break she just managed to make the hop.' She stares at the paper.    His voice comes gently..."
george,hy would you even read that garbage?
amelia,"Well, it reminds me how much I owe to the men of this world. Keeps me humble."
george,ood. And remembering how little you owe me keeps me humble. And softly...
george,You've made them feel like this.
amelia,That's not enough.
george,"Most of them are women. And for them, it's very much enough. She shakes her head."
amelia,"The World Telegram said, `a magnificent display of useless courage.'"
george,The question is. Can any magnif- icent display of courage be use- less?     A
melia,The point is. Men do it every day. And no one throws a parade. Ah.   Well...
george,"One day closer, then. To the day when they won't think to throw one for you. She doesn't turn.   She doesn't smile."
amelia,Reasoning with me. A magnificent display of useless courage. He nods to himself.
george,And.   It's fun. From the stage...
george,"If a bomb goes off tonight, the whole government of the United States is out there..."
george,Some dog catcher will have to become President. She smiles.    Just for him.
amelia,Ladies.
amelia,"Thursday, I'll be in Boston. Meeting Gene Vidal and Paul Collins. Said lightly. Not even looking at him.     While through the glass, it's become quite a tussle."
george,Don't tell me Gene wants to resurrect Transcontinental?
amelia,"No, he's starting a shuttle service. Washington, New York, Boston... One woman goes flying from view, as a younger one gets her place."
george,Gene's a dashing guy. He could talk anyone into anything. Their look holds.
gene,"Transcontinental was too ambitious. Too many hops, too tough on the ladies. But the shuttle... A lean athlete's body, easy grace in every movement. Strikingly handsome features that convey not only intellect, but kindness and decency."
amelia,What on earth would you need me for? She's making a real mess of the lobster.    Gene notices.   PAUL COLLINS doesn't...
paul,"Hasn't George taught you anything? Lady Lindy, the queen of the air, the best known woman in the entire U.S. of A? Gene reaches over, as if it were his own plate, and begins cracking her lobster for her. She looks in his eyes and tries to concentrate."
dissolve to...,"LATER. Paul has gone. Gene and Amelia are at the bar, huddled over his beer and her Coke."
gene,"I'm rattling on here, and you've got a morning train. But she's just staring in his eyes.   This could be her last chance to ask..."
amelia,How's Nina doing?
gene,"Oh, fine. Really?   He smiles, gently."
amelia,"If you two get bored, I could tag along sometimes."
gene,You suggesting you're less boring than I am?
amelia,"Well, yeh. He smiles first.    Hers is slower, but here it comes."
gene,"Gore would love that. He has a little crush, I'm afraid."
amelia,At seven?
gene,"He's eight. Well, then. He breaks the look.     Fishes out some cash for the bar tab.        G"
amelia,"Are you kidding, it's a godsend. No matter how hard George and I work, how many lectures we cram in, there's never enough money for the next adventure. He looks at her. Lets the silence sit there.     His eyes seem to convey a depth of understanding."
gene,The next adventure.    What is it? She shrugs.    No idea.
amelia,Wish you'd do something about that.
gene,"I'm serious, Amelia. Her soft smile."
amelia,I know.   Always.
gene,The only way you can stay where you are. And be who you are... Serious indeed.
gene,"The price of fame, literally. Do you and George talk about this? Silence."
amelia,We don't have to.
gene,"With all respect.    Yes, you do."
amelia,"For understanding. There is no smile. Without a word, she goes into her room. CLOSES the door behind her. e stands alone. Do I knock on that door?     Then, smiles to himself, and simply... Walks away."
melia,So he hasn't actually forbidden you.
eleanor,Franklin doesn't forbid. He just feels it's a waste of my valuable ime to learn. Since I can't afford to buy a plane.
amelia,The wrong Roosevelt got elected.
eleanor,And it will take at least four years to correct the mistake. Keeps eating.
amelia,"I think the structure may be less important than the man chosen to run it. Said casually, looking at her plate."
eleanor,"My hearing is failing. I missed the words `or woman,' which you undoubtedly added after, or per- haps before, the word `man.'"
amelia,his could be one of those rare instances. When the most accomplished candidate. Turns out to be male. Glances up for the reaction.
eleanor,How exciting. I love finding the exception that proves the rule. Is t a name I know? Amelia's straight gaze.   Her small smile.
amelia,How do you feel about flying at night? Eleanor's eyes register the change of topic.     Rolling with it...
eleanor,I've never done it.   Franklin finds t dangerous.
amelia,Outstanding.
amelia,It's dual controls.   No one will ever know. Hesitation.
eleanor,Dear God. The Condor purrs along through the night air. The moon bobs slightly off to one side. Eleanor's eyes are swimming with the thrill of this.
amelia,I feel like a Coke.   Can I get you something? And stands up. Only the trace of her smile as the pilot's eyes WIDEN in absolute shock.
roosevelt,"Today, we proudly announce an appointment critical to America's commerce, and to its role as technology's leader in the Twentieth Century. PAN to Gene at his side.   Sober.   Distinguished.   Proud."
amelia,Have I told you what a perfect job ou did on the peonies? They're miraculous.
amelia,Sorry.
george,"It's all right. You've been distracted lately. No spin on that.   If G anything, the tone is kind."
amelia,When are you leaving?
george,Thing is.     I'd like you to come. She stiffens only slightly.     Can he sense it?
amelia,I don't really see how I can.
george,"I've talked to the promoters, they'll switch some lecture dates for us. Now he's looking at her profile.     Saddened, if not surprised, by what he sees."
amelia,"Well, it's not just that. There's y work on the shuttle, we're at a critical stage, and...I've just started as Gene's consultant at the Aeronautics Branch... She knows he's watching.    Shakes her head.    Keeps on working."
george,"Normally, I'd be worried about leaving you here alone. But I suppose that won't be a problem, will it? She stops now. Looks up at him.      If he wants a direct conversation, he can have it."
amelia,What are you trying to say?
george,"I think I've just said it. A long held look.       Neither backing away.   Sadness on both sides. GEORGE  Is there anything you want to say? She sighs.       Her fingers reach out, rub his hand with affection."
amelia,"I can't think of anything helpful. He nods.   Well, then.      Rises slowly... Walks back toward the house, his garden tools forgotten.          She stares after him."
eorge,I found something you'd written. Draws a breath.     Reads...
amelia,"I suppose I thought.      It was too revealing. WIDEN ANGLE. Gene enters the room with a drink in his hand and sits down next to her, concerned by her obvious distress. AMELIA  I'm so glad you have it now."
gene,"If you don't drink, why do you come o bars?"
amelia,Must be the ambience.   And the nuts.
gene,"What worries me is, in some of these bars the nuts are the ambience. Specially when they make a pass at you."
amelia,"Any guy would have to be nuts to do that. I'm considerable trouble, if you haven't noticed."
gene,"You keep advertising that, but I'm still waiting to see it. She looks down at her fingers as they shell.    Barely audible..."
amelia,You'll see it.
gene,"Well, here's your chance. I'm taking Gore to the conference in Bermuda. He wants you to come."
amelia,"Gore, huh?"
gene,Sure.   I'm completely indifferent.
amelia,I wish. Do you?
gene,That's a wonderful idea. Especially now. Something in the way he said that.
amelia,What's special about now?
gene,A good time for some positive press about you as a role model. Her eyes harden.   Whatever do you mean?
amelia,Not unless someone makes me.
gene,"Well, someone should. Because they're all saying you took recklessly dangerous solo flights for no earthly purpose except publicity. Meaning, money. Dead.   Silence.     G"
amelia,How thoughtless of me to be doing ll this in a society where no one else is interested in making money. Present company included. He's not afraid of her.
gene,"Look, George had you taking money rom the sugar cartel for the Hawaii flight, the Mexican Government for theirs, he's selling commemorative stamps which you carried on the flights..."
amelia,"If this is about George, just say o. Because we made those calls, nd we includes me."
gene,"I'm sorry I said it that way. This s actually about you, because I'm picking a fight, apparently a useless one, for the benefit of someone I care about."
amelia,"And what's your point? Women are eld to some higher standard? Bankers and industrialists are ad- mired for succeeding, but women are just considered selfish and grasping? ENE  Of course they are."
amelia,"Well, let's change that, shall we? r would you just prefer to adopt t, since groveling would be easier. Staring at each other."
gene,"If you want to make money, my guess s that people viewing you as Lady Lindy, America's Sweetheart of the Skies, the wife/mother/daughter they all wished they had. Would be helpful."
amelia,Thanks for the tip.
gene,Thanks for not being defensive. Full beat.
amelia,"Well, I'm an open-minded girl. And o prove it, I'm hereby resigning as your consultant at the S            Aeronautics Branch. he throws some money on the table for the drinks.  AMELIA  Next time you read the papers.      Try reading between the lines. Walks out.       Gene makes no move to follow.   He's said his piece."
amelia,"I came to Washington today with the National Women's Party, to ask the President for his aid in passing the Lucretia Mott Amendment for equal rights. She waits for the press to quiet."
amelia,"...including them wanting us to say darn instead of damn. Laughter.   The girl flushes a little, her point is a crucial one..."
amelia,Don't. She meant that.      And no one is laughing now.
amelia,"Trust me. Only a husband talks like that. In their laughter, she goes to the phone.      EVERYBODY hangs on every word of... AMELIA  Yes?  Yes. Yes... (hand over phone, to the"
amelia,"Are you going to tell me your surprise, or do I have to get physical?"
george,"Boy, that is the last thing I'd want. Well, then?"
amelia,"Except it would have to be an Electra, and they cost..."
george,"...$36,000. After a generous discount from Lockheed."
amelia,May as well be a billion.
george,...not to mention at least another 36 to get it modified and ready. She glances at him.      He looks awfully smug.
amelia,"And your surprise is, you robbed a bank."
george,Actually.    A university. They stop.    What on earth...?
amelia,Think I could help? He looks in her eyes.
george,Nah. She grins.
amelia,Cat food.    A whole case.
amelia,"As President Elliot has said, it would be a shining adventure, beckoning with new experiences. Making me more useful to the program here at Purdue. She looks into the eyes of each in turn..."
gore,"So you'd be the first one, right? ou always like that. First one?"
amelia,"Well, there's Magellan, 400 years go. Actually, he didn't make it. And he died. And he used a boat."
gore,"So it's almost the same, except it's completely different."
amelia,Pretty much. He glowers at her.    She glowers back.
gene,"There are men who say they flew around the world, but they didn't ly around all of it."
gore,"Because at higher latitudes, it's short trip. At the North Pole, ou just spin in a circle and you've gone around the world."
amelia,So why are you asking? Just to show how smart you are?
gore,Pretty much.
amelia,No one's tried it.    You think I should? No answer.
gore,Okay.
amelia,Okay. Is she serious?       She seems to be.
gene,Ask her about the Pacific. The maximum range of the Electra is 4000 miles. And the closest land est of Honolulu is farther than that. Gore looks to her.       Well?
amelia,I'll have to refuel.
gore,Where?
amelia,In the air. One plane to another. The boy is staring at her now.       Staring.
gore,"You're really going to do all this, aren't you?"
amelia,"Well, don't you think I can? A beat."
gore,I guess we'll find out.
amelia,Pretty much. HOLD on Gene.   He smiles at his kid...
gene,"Go out to the car and get Sara. Ask if she'll take you for an ice cream. Okay? The boy knows he's being dismissed. Looks from his dad to Amelia, who steps forward to give him a hug and a kiss."
amelia,"We'll play some cards before you leave. Okay, then. He waves. One more glance at dad, and Gore goes. Gene gestures for Amelia to come with him, away from the mechanics. What's up? But he's already walking to... ...a little folding table, off in a corner.     She follows. Sits. Well...?       G"
ene,You can't refuel in the air. Just like that.
amelia,s that an opinion or an order? His rueful smile.
gene,The only good thing about losing our former relationship is I feel a little freer to tell you when you're being completely crazy.
amelia,"Oh, I bet there are more advantages than just that. No one's backing down on this."
gene,You're not a good enough pilot to o mid-air refueling. You will not be able to control the Electra or that docking maneuver for that amount of time.
amelia,I've taken bigger risks.
gene,I've noticed. Don't be so proud of it. He reaches into a pocket. Pulls out a folded sheet of paper. It opens to reveal a MAP of the Pacific. A dot is CIRCLED in red.
amelia,It's your vacation home.
gene,"We're colonizing it, because when the Japanese make their move, we're going to need a refueling strip there. She blinks.   The Japanese."
amelia,"Hullo, Fred. It's good to meet you. She holds out her hand. He juggles the mugs, so he can shake it. Strong look in each other's eyes. Hands her a mug..."
fred,I hear you like your coffee black.
amelia,"This time of day, I like it with bacon and eggs. His slight grin.       A handsome guy."
fred,Be right back.
amelia,Over easy on the eggs.      Your job could depend on it. Silence between them.       Comfortable smiles.
fred,"Are we sizing me up? And, of course, this is exactly what she's doing."
amelia,I'm told that mid-air refueling would be beyond my abilities.
fred,"Maybe, maybe not. 20% it works. 0% you crash. 60% you don't get he fuel, so you're cooked anyway."
amelia,Better odds of hitting that island?
red,How do you feel about 100%? Watching his eyes as he says that.    Evaluating.
amelia,Even with cloud cover?
fred,I've crossed the Pacific by air 18 times. Pan Am told you I'm the best celestial navigator they've ever seen.
amelia,They did.
fred,"Someone else told you I have a drinking problem. Which is a big art of why we're here, yes? No answer."
amelia,My dad drank. He lied all the time. Rest his soul.
fred,You trusted Bill Stultz. That worked out. Rest his soul.
amelia,"Bill just had to find Europe. We're looking for something less than two miles long, with nothing higher on it than 18 feet. He shakes his head."
fred,That's what you're looking for. I'm looking for coordinates on a map. And if it doesn't work... He spreads his large hands...
amelia,Did I pressure the navy to build a landing strip at Howland Island? How exactly would I do that? L         Threaten not to enlist? aughter in the room.   More flashes.
george,"Wait a minute, you're flying around the world? Don't you know a woman's place is in the home?? The press ROARS with laughter."
george,I begged to go. But it seems that between 185 pounds of husband and
amelia,"Who am I to argue with `experts?' I'll just give you my plain old common-sense thinking on this... Pens come up, cameras jockey for position. This is what they're waiting for. She holds up one finger. First..."
fred,Lovely. We've got so much fuel we can't possibly get off the ground. Much safer than flying.
amelia,"Well, we need enough for a third pass at Howland. After you miss it the first couple times around. Ah."
fred,"Good thinking. he runway lights go ON, and..."
fred,"Good reaction, cutting the switch. You saved our ass. She doesn't even hear, THROWING open the cockpit, WAVING to signal they're all right, we SMASH CUT TO..."
george,"Three weeks, she'll be good as new. It's a remarkable crew. The best"
amelia,...the best that money can buy. I just can't believe I've done this o us. All the money wasted that's never coming back.
george,You cut the engines. It would have cost a bundle more to replace a burned-up plane. Not to mention pilot. She shakes her head.    No.
amelia,"I overreacted. The plane was too heavy, I should have used the rudder pedal instead of the throttle. Tears stand in her eyes. She is so ashamed and remorseful. He lets it stay silent as they walk. Then..."
george,"t's only money, we'll figure it out. We always do."
amelia,"I'll make it back and more, I promise. The book sales, the lectures, this flight will keep us going another three years."
george,Maybe.   Or...
amelia,"No, it will. Our prices, our sales, are going to double."
amelia,You mean after.
george,Or.     Even now. A strong smile.    He nods.     We could.
amelia,So my exit would be a stupid crash. nd withdrawing from a world- publicized attempt to finally do something no man had done before.
george,Yeh. That. And it would be fine ith me. Her eyes overwhelmed A his offer. by                  Her voice soft with...
melia,But that's because you're an idiot.
george,Lucky for you. A held beat.
amelia,And what if it's not something I have to show the world? Hmmn?
amelia,What if it's something I have to show me. He has no answer for that.       Takes her hand.   They head toward the house.
george,Have fun.
amelia,"Who let you off the hook on this? She takes his hand firmly and together they cross the hangar toward Gene. He smiles, unfolds a third chair. As they arrive, Amelia steps forward... ...kisses Gene on the cheek.    George shakes his hand."
gene,"Thanks for letting me come. As they sit, Gene looks from one to the other."
george,She'd outvote you all by herself. he does it to me every day. Gene's smile can't mask the concern in his eyes.
amelia,"I don't have a choice. I have to reverse my route and fly east. If go west now, I'm risking hurricanes in the Caribbean and monsoons in Africa..."
gene,"But you're flying Howland last, when you're exhausted. She knows this.   In the silence..."
eorge,"Gene, this way our first leg is Oakland to Miami. It's a shakedown o make sure the plane is right. That's crucial. Gene nods, slowly.    His eyes still locked on her."
gene,"Maybe I'm obsessing on Howland because it was my bright idea, and I'd feel responsible if..."
amelia,"Well, if I do pop off, I'll try to make it somewhere that's not your fault."
gene,I'd appreciate that. Draws a breath.
amelia,"But I'll have Fred so I won't miss. In fact, I'm taking Fred along for this whole trip. Surprisingly, he doesn't seem to like this.   She smiles."
gene,You and Fred alone for a month...
amelia,"If you're worried about his drinking, I'll deal with it. Straight look."
gene,How do you feel?
george,"Tip-top. Every little girl needs a man around. Even strong girls like ours, hmmn? A very direct gaze.   Words neither said nor needed."
amelia,I'll be flying sky no one's ever been in. You made that happen. She looks down to his easy smile.
george,Hate to think where you'd be without me. She smiles back.       Tenderness we don't always see.
amelia,I'll try to make you proud.
george,"You did that long, long ago. Only ne person left to prove yourself o. Just make sure you do it."
amelia,And then what?
george,Then the best part.    The future. She stares in his eyes.       Leans to him. AMELIA  Oh yeh.    That. She brings her hands to his face. Her mouth to his.      Deep. Longing. Her body sinks into him. LONG ANGLE.      Two alone.   Only each other.
amelia,If you'll fly the plane.   Make it twenty. And then...
george,We're saying he's cruel?
amelia,No.
george,Controlling?
amelia,Insecure.
george,Especially the mice.
amelia,Exactly. Each poor mouse thinks it's all about her. Staring at each other.
george,And one of them.    Is right. AMELIA  She knows. And then...
george,want you to give me something. He's never sounded quite like this before.
amelia,"Don't you know I couldn't? Even if part of me wanted to. Very, very much. The look holds."
george,"Well, I love you back."
amelia,"Thanks. Takes a step back toward the hangar door. One hand slightly up, stay here. Then, the smile he's waited for."
amelia,That's more like it. She starts to TURN the plane around.
red,Black eagles. If one of those clips a propeller. Or flies into the engine... Her tired features form a smile.
amelia,'ve got an idea. Let's never land. Better safe than sorry. He takes her point.    She turns back to work...
fred,"Cream, no sugar."
fred,Howland Island. He strikes a match. SNUFFS the flame. Puts the burned-out match head just by the scrap of cracker.
george,"Mrs. Earhart? Mr. Earhart, here. He looks elegant in crisp suit and tie. INTERCUT: Amelia's eyes WIDE. She seems truly thrilled. INTERCUT BETWEEN THEM now throughout..."
amelia,"Oh, my goodness.   Simpkin, is it really you? George makes a PURRING sound.     A sharp MEOW."
george,"It gets worse, I bought a brand-new suit and tie. Got a date with my wife."
amelia,We can't possibly afford this.
george,"ure, we can. It's Tuesday's call o Lae that we can't afford. AMELIA  You hang up the phone this minute. You'll bankrupt us and I'll have to walk home."
george,easoning with me. A magnificent display of useless courage. Her eyes remember.    A soft...
amelia,..and it's fun. HOLD on her face.    And MATCH DISSOLVE TO...
fred,"A touching love story, really. He's been drinking, we can hear it in his voice.   SEE the bottle now. Nearly gone."
amelia,An honest one. It's what you wanted. He nods.   That's right.
fred,I wonder if it's honest enough for George. If it's what he wanted. ou know.
amelia,"If you mean Gene, we're not together anymore. In that way. Not for a long time."
fred,Whose choice was that? She doesn't like his tone.      Shifts in her seat.
amelia,It was mine.
fred,"Well, isn't it always? You choose in, you choose out. Makes things easy."
amelia,Anything but easy. Are you disapproving of the way I live?
fred,"Hell, no. It's just like me. In fact, it's like most guys I know. His smile."
melia,"If you have a point, Fred.   Make it."
fred,"Oh, I believe I have. She rises slowly. Zips her flight jacket.        Takes her slicker from the back of her chair."
amelia,"Allow me to cut you a deal, my friend. Steel in the spine of that."
balfour,"Ready, Mum. He stands and she takes his seat. He shows her the key to press, then steps back toward the window. But she makes no move to the radio. Just stares at him. He doesn't understand. AMELIA  Feel like stepping out for a smoke...?"
balfour,I don't smoke.
amelia,...or something? Oh.   The monsoon beats down.
balfour,"If you need help, I'll be right outside. In the rain."
amelia,Thank you.     I'll only be a moment.
eorge,You should be sleeping. He smiles to keep his voice up. The eyes aren't smiling.       We INTERCUT their conversation throughout...
amelia,You should be working.
george,"I'm running a big adventure here, 'm a very important fellow."
amelia,You told me I was the star.   And you were no one at all. GEORGE  I thought I was lying. Guess the joke's on me. Silence.
amelia,"I'm mad at him. I'll be in Honolulu on the 3rd, and with you in Oakland for Fourth of July. Okay?"
george,Don't keep me waiting.
amelia,"I won't dare. You're a very important feline. Uh, fellow."
george,Talk to me about Fred.
amelia,Fred is fine. He's calculating head-wind speed versus fuel as we speak. CLOSE on his face.
george,You wouldn't sell a salesman would you?
amelia,He's fine.
george,So what's that I hear in     your voice? A beat.
george,Is he drinking? AMELIA  I can handle it.
george,Call it off. Right now.      I mean it.
amelia,I can handle it. And then...
amelia,I love you. Silence.
george,After the Fourth.     We're going home.
amelia,Where's that?
george,For me?   Anywhere you are. She begins to cry. Both hands fly to her mouth and she looks away. She swallows hard.
amelia,I'm going to like it there. And then...
george,Well.    If you insist. She nods.   She does.
amelia,t's late here. Guess I'll go curl up under a teacup.
george,I'll go tell the world you're on your way. Neither wants to let go.      We feel it so strong. GEORGE  See ya. And he's gone.      She stares at the radio.
fred,You're finding the range. But it might be easier to just shoot me. She stares at him for a moment.       A subdued voice...
amelia,"Traveling light, that's all. She sits on the lip of the hatch.       Her legs dangling.   Her eyes down."
fred,Got room for 190 pounds of asshole? No answer.       She's still looking down.   He's never seen her like this.
amelia,It's fine. Her eyes come up.
fred,I can run into town before we go. et that in the post for you. She shakes her head slowly.
amelia,It's for my husband. I'm going to hand it to him. So I can watch his face as he reads it. She sniffles slightly.
george,ire back. Tell him to forget the Morse Code. They didn't bring the receiver. The young man looks concerned.
cipriani,The direction finder.   How long has this been on? The seaman turns back at the door.   What?
bellarts,That's her on 3105. She said `cloudy and overcast.' O'Hare looks at him. Are you serious? Bellarts mimes typing with his fingers. O'Hare starts typing into the log.
bellarts,"Commander estimated 7:00. If she's having trouble on voice transmission, stay with Morse. And begins to carefully pack his pipe.      Dalten begins to transmit Morse Code. DISSOLVE TO..."
dalten,She's got to stay on longer. Bellarts dictating as O'Hare types...
bellarts,"Earhart signal strength 4, but on"
bellarts,"Tommy, intercom top deck, double check the smoke stack... INTERCUT: AERIAL ANGLE high above the ship.       BLACK SMOKE PLUMES into clear sky..."
thompson,"You've got her signal, dammit. What about the direction finder?"
bellarts,"Cipriani reports the battery's dead, sir. It was left on all night. Full beat. THOMPSON  I don't believe this is happening."
