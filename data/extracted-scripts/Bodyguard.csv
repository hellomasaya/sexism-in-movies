Speaker,Dialogue
for educational,"PURPOSES ONLY  SCREEN IS BLACK In the darkness we hear dripping water, the echoing approach of two sets of footsteps. There is the sound of a sudden, quick scuffle, a heavy fall of bodies. THREE BOOMING GUNSHOTS. Two from one gun, one from another. So fast and close, they're barely distinguish- able. The sound of the SHOTS ECHOES against concrete walls and dies away. Silence. SLOW, SLOW, FADE IN:  1   INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE  Call 911. "
klingman,"Your hands ever shake, Frank? FRANK Sometimes.   It's just adrenaline. KLINGMAN ... How did you know? FRANK I saw him washing the car. KLINGMAN I saw him. FRANK They don't wash cars on the parking levels. He hands a glass of brandy to Frank, who looks at it. KLINGMAN You know, I'd like you to stay on. He passes a small sealed envelope to Frank. FRANK I'm not good in permanent positions, my feet go to sleep. The two men smile at each other. They raise their glasses in a joint salutation -- Klingman drinks. Frank doesn't."
devaney," $2,500. FRANK There are several good men available for that kind of money. Have you talked to Fitzgerald or Racine? Portman? DEVANEY Yeah.   Portman was interested... He senses an opening and sits down beside Frank for what he takes to be the first serious talk. DEVANEY ... but we're told you're the best. FRANK There's no such thing. DEVANEY Farmer, we're talking about a very frightened lady. With a"
frank,"Henry Ford, to see Mr. Devaney. EMMA Come in, please."
tony,"Ehh! RACHEL  Don't worry, Rory. Tony doesn't appreciate great art. The pinned-up girl has been brought forward for Rachel's approval, elbowing Devaney a little to one side."
dress designer," Let's see the back again... DEVANEY Rachel, raise your butt out of there and meet this man. RACHEL MARRON finally rises from the sofa.     It's a bit of"
rachel,"You don't look like a bodyguard. FRANK What did you expect? RACHEL I don't know. Tough guy maybe. FRANK This is my disguise. RACHEL  The back's still not right... SPECTOR, still on the phone, offers a perfunctory wave. DEVANEY ... Sy Spector, Rachel's publicist."
rachel,"Can we get you a drink? FRANK Orange juice. RACHEL Straight?   Nicki. Nicki goes to the bar. Rachel sits and motions for Frank to sit opposite her. RACHEL Rory, I'll be with you in a second. Rory gets up, and goes over to his dancers at the big screen video. RACHEL Listen, this whole thing is Bill's idea... This sudden obsession with protecting me. Tony has always handled my security and we've done just fine. SPECTOR  Nicki, I'm sure Mr. Farmer would tell you the number of nuts writing fan letters jumps every time Rachel is on the cover of a magazine. DEVANEY Not like this."
devaney,"Farmer, will you wait a minute? I should have told you more. I'm sorry but I was afraid she wouldn't go through with it. I thought I'd let the two of you work it out... come to an understanding. FRANK We did. Frank starts to walk off.   Devaney is grasping at straws. DEVANEY She's not a bad person, and whether she knows it or not, she needs you.  You've come this far... Would you just wait here for one minute. I want to show you something. Please, Farmer. Devaney runs back to the house."
fletcher,"I've got ears. FRANK I'll remember that. Devaney trots into the pool area, out of breath. He is holding a bulging manila file. As he sees Fletcher, he holds the file casually at his side. Frank sees Fletcher looking at the file. DEVANEY How are you, Fletch?  Nice meeting you. Fletcher looks after them silently."
frank,"This is a little old lady in Akron. She's written to everybody I've ever worked for. He continues to turn until something stops him. Several letters are paper-clipped together. They are the pasted- up type we saw being assembled on the desk top. SPECTOR Reagan got shot. His chatter is beginning to annoy Frank. FRANK Not on my shift. Spector emits a gratuitous laugh, acknowledges the joke. SPECTOR That's good. Frank goes back to his letters.   He taps the stack in the center of the table. FRANK At first glance, these don't bother me. But keep them. You never know. He separates one letter from the others. FRANK This could be something. Devaney searches Frank's face. DEVANEY You think it could be the same guy? The one who rigged the doll?"
frank,I don't know. Did you tell Miss Marron about it? Does she know about the doll? Devaney and Spector exchange looks.   This is evidently a sore point between them.
spector,"We said there'd been some electrical problem while she was on stage. Short circuit. Look, she doesn't need that kind of worry right now. It would upset her. FRANK What about the police? SPECTOR There was no reason for the police. No one got hurt. FRANK What about the chauffeur? SPECTOR It was nothing. It was just our people there. Frank turns and watches Fletcher by the pool.   Devaney's eyes are still on Frank's face. DEVANEY Sy, I think we should show him the room."
spector,She didn't have to like it... Devaney gently lays the cut-out letter on the bed. DEVANEY We found the letter here.
frank,"Somebody was in here? DEVANEY Somebody broke in and ... masturbated on the bed. FRANK And she doesn't know about this either? Devaney shakes his head. SPECTOR Are you kidding? This would really freak her out. DEVANEY What do you think? FRANK Someone penetrates the house, gets upstairs and jerks off on the bed ... I'd say that qualifies as a problem. DEVANEY What kind of problem? SPECTOR  Of fuck, we don't need this now... FRANK This house is wide open. SPECTOR Excuse me? FRANK I said this house is wide open"
devaney,"I'll talk to her, I'll make her understand. I can do that. SPECTOR No.   I'll talk to her. Spector exits the room in a huff."
henry,"And it wasn't, was it? Henry unconsciously flexes his fingers, easing the muscles in his hands. Frank notices and pulls out a small tube of ointment from a pouch he's unpacking. He hands it to Henry. FRANK Put this on your arm.    It'll help the ache. Henry takes it but is noncommittal. FRANK I'll bet you can fill up a whole day just washing the cars and driving Rachel Marron around town. HENRY That's my job. FRANK We're adding to your duties. HENRY Huh? FRANK You're my new assistant. Frank removes three boxes of cartridges from the suitcase and puts them in the back of a dresser drawer as Henry watches. HENRY Says who? FRANK Henry, I've spent a lot of time guarding people all over the world"
rachel,"appears beside Fletcher, looks down there too, then leads her son purposefully away. Fletcher isn't happy about it."
nicki,My own ego wall. No platinum records. Frank spots a picture of two girls.
frank,"You and Rachel? NICKI When I was a kid, I put a little band together. We played high school dances, stuff like that. Then Rachel joined the act. As you can imagine, she was quite a little entertainer. Even then, she had a way of stopping the show. So I kind of quit. Professionally, anyway. FRANK You never went back? NICKI It was pretty obvious who the star in our family was. Frank looks back at the picture.    Nicki smiles."
court,"I sort of lost track of you after Washington. FRANK Yeah. COURT How's the private stuff? FRANK  Fine. COURT Big money, I bet? Huh? Frank shrugs.    Court looks at Minella knowingly."
woman," Goodbye, Nicki. So great to see you. Nicki waves and follows Rachel. Frank stays very close without seeming to walk with Rachel."
frank,"No, just slow down. The car slows. ANGLE - SPECTOR AND RACHEL IN BACK"
fletcher," She's got him by the short ones, doesn't she, Frank? Frank squelches a smile at Henry.   Where did he learn that? FRANK Yeah, she makes him nervous. They watch as Devaney SCREECHES to a STOP, gets out and hurries inside."
nicki,On the patio. RACHEL He's through messing with my life.
devaney,"Rachel, I'm getting goddamn sick of running up here every time he steps on your toes.  Farmer! Would you come in here a minute?"
rachel, 'I don't want her doing anything she's always done.' The guy's a fanatic. DEVANEY So are the guys he's protecting you from. RACHEL Excuse me if I don't faint. NICKI Think of Fletcher --
spector, Tuesday -- morning -- brunch. Where did you find this guy? Rachel turns ON the BLENDER and stares at Frank.
henry, I wish Rachel didn't keep coming here. It makes me nervous. TONY Me too. 'Cept I'm not nervous 'cos I got you with me.
rachel," You can be as you choose to be. It's an act of discipline sometimes, but it can be done. Rachel stops in her tracks... then opens the curtains and looks at herself in the mirror. Also reflected in the mirror is Frank. RACHEL That why you never stay with one of your clients? They too undisciplined for you? Or is it you're afraid you'll start to care about them?"
frank," That's right. Rachel turns to Frank. RACHEL Can't you answer straight just once? Why don't you talk to me? I'm not such a bad lady. FRANK You're too clever for me.   I can't keep up. Frank continues to search the shop and street with his gaze. Rachel steps closer to him. RACHEL Look at me, Farmer! Frank turns and looks at her. RACHEL You don't approve of me, do you? FRANK Disapproval's a luxury I can't afford. Gets in the way. RACHEL Don't like emotions getting to you, huh? Never mix business with pleasure? FRANK That's right. It's a stand-off. After a moment, Rachel motions to an outfit on a rack just behind him. RACHEL Grab that would you? Frank takes a beat.   Looks out the window. FRANK I'm here to keep you alive... not to help you shop. Fuming, Rachel sizes things up, then grabs it herself, whipping the curtain shut behind her. A smile plays across Frank's face."
frank,"What's the Mayan? Spector starts to climb into the limo. SPECTOR It's a club, Frank. Come on, Henry, let's go. FRANK Spector, you've got to tell me about these things. SPECTOR I just did. He disappears inside the limo. Rachel tugs at Frank's lapels, looks him up and down, brushing something off his shoulder. Frank's annoyed. RACHEL Nice suit, Frank. Rachel is about to get in. FRANK Rachel. He removes something from his pocket, a small enameled cross. FRANK I want you to keep this. Rachel looks at it, both flattered and confused. RACHEL For me?   It's beautiful."
frank,"It's fitted with a radio transmitter. When you close the clasp, it sends a signal. If there's ever a problem and we're separated, just press it and I'll know you need me."
spector,"It wasn't me. The car turns a corner and there it is, The Mayan only fifty yards ahead, a mob of fans spilling out of the club, off the sidewalk and into the street."
tony,Fuckin' a. Spector whoops with uncontrolled delight from the back of the limo. Frank stares ahead in disbelief. The NOISE of the CROWD can be heard as they pull up front.
rachel,"Tell me what? DEVANEY There were some letters before, Rachel... same kind of thing, threats, oddball stuff... SPECTOR We didn't want to worry you... DEVANEY ... and somebody got into the house..."
rachel," Someone was in my house? SPECTOR Okay.   Let's not get hysterical... FRANK Let's get her out of here. RACHEL Someone was in my house? SPECTOR It was weeks ago. You were out of town... RACHEL While Fletcher was there? SPECTOR Listen, Fletcher is okay. The house is like Fort Knox now. Right, Frank? FRANK We should get her out of here. Right now! SPECTOR There's no way anyone could... RACHEL No way anyone could what? SPECTOR No, wait... look everybody calm down. Calm down. DEVANEY Sy."
spector,"Let's just see how she is.  How do you feel, honey? Someone comes through the door with some flowers.   Frank eases them out and gently closes the door. FRANK I can't protect her out there. RACHEL Do you think he's out there? Devaney can't answer.   She turns to Frank."
rachel,"He's here, isn't he? FRANK He might be. SPECTOR We don't know that. Frank, we don't know that. Rachel is enraged. RACHEL But you know he was in my house... oh my God. DEVANEY Let's go home, Sy. We'll have to make an announcement. SPECTOR Fine, you make it, they'll tear the fucking place apart."
spector,"Look. Frank, I know what you're saying. I know you want to do what's best for her. I understand that. You have a job to do here. But you have to understand that Rachel has a job to do too. And that's what she's doing - out there. She's working, Frank. That's what she does and that's where she does it. She's hot right now. This is the time for her. If she doesn't get out there, she's dead. Forget about crazy death threats, if she doesn't sing, she's dead anyway... Look, handled properly, this thing could be good for a million dollars' worth of free publicity. Frank grabs him by the collar and slams him up against a wall of curtain ropes. FRANK One word. SPECTOR It could clinch her the nomination. FRANK One word in print about any of this... Spector nods, half-gasping. Frank tightens his grip. Frank's attention is drawn by a renewed roar from the crowd. SPECTOR Trouble with you is you don't understand the sympathy vote."
spector,"Look at her, fucking great."
frank,"Tony, not there. TONY I'll take care of this. He heads for the door."
tony,Just follow me. He turns and heads out to the sidewalk like a bull.
frank,I know why.
frank,"Hey. RACHEL You're probably wondering what I'm doing.  You didn't know I jogged, did you?"
rachel,"Farmer... I have this problem. This minor little problem. You see, I'd like to go out for an evening. Just me and a guy. You know...  God, this is embarrassing. I'm gonna run up ahead there. You decide. She runs up the hill to the pool area, which is now above them. He walks up after her."
rachel,"Have you ever liked anybody? FRANK What do you mean? RACHEL Like me -- a girl. Frank knows what she's driving at. But he's not at all happy to relinquish this information. FRANK A long time ago. RACHEL What happened? Do you mind if I ask? FRANK Do you mind if I don't answer? RACHEL I don't want to pry... Frank smiles at that. RACHEL  She didn't die did she? You weren't like... protecting her and she got killed? Frank is silent, grim.    Rachel looks stricken. RACHEL Oh, my god!    That's it, isn't it?"
frank,"Nobody's perfect. Rachel is taken aback. RACHEL Oh Frank, I'm sorry."
rachel, I'm sorry... It's just that... It's so depressing. Now they're both laughing.
frank," It is, isn't it. Suddenly a dish drops to the floor. Frank, still dancing, makes a smooth quick turn that puts his body between Rachel and the noise. His head turns to locate the source of the noise."
rachel,"Don't worry, I'll protect you. They drift back into the music, Rachel singing, Frank watching."
frank,"End. RACHEL Were you tough? FRANK No.    Fast. Rachel puts down her drink and moves toward a samurai sword that is mounted in its scabbard on the wall. She looks at it, peering closely. RACHEL You some kind of a samurai, too?"
rachel,"It seems to me a bodyguard must know little peace. Frank stands up so that the point of the sword is only about an inch from his chest. He reaches out over the blade to Rachel's neck and unties the silk scarf she is wearing there. One hand draws the scarf away. The other hand lingers for a moment on her neck, then lifts away. FRANK Watch this. He has raised the scarf over his head, in   the space between them. With two hands he spreads    it out and then lets it go. Slowly, billowing, the scarf    floats down over the blade and is cut in two. These    two pieces float slowly to the floor. Frank takes Rachel's wrist and moves the sword away to the side. They are both holding it as Rachel presses her body against Frank's and they begin to kiss."
rachel,"I'm not confused. Frank finds his shoes. FRANK You pay me to protect you, that's what I do. Rachel sits up. RACHEL What? Have I done something wrong? FRANK No, nothing. RACHEL Then what is it? She lifts the sheet seductively and looks over the top of it. RACHEL Do you want me to beg? FRANK No, I want you to do without. She stops. RACHEL What's going on, Frank? FRANK I want to keep it straight in my head what job I'm doing."
rachel,"And what is that exactly?    Making me feel like shit? FRANK No, I'm sorry. This is my fault."
rachel,Don't apologize for godsake. Just tell me what I did. I'm a big girl. FRANK You didn't do anything. It was me. I involved myself with my client.
nicki," Thought you'd like to know. Everyone said she was a sure thing. Of course, you know all about that. She raises an eyebrow, gives him a look. Frank looks steadily back at her. She drops a small pile of mail beside the magazines... several letters and a small packet. She's embarrassed by Frank's gaze. NICKI I'm sorry. That was out of line. It's none of my business... Here's today's question marks for you. She turns and walks briskly back to the house. Frank watches her go, then looks slowly down to the pile. From across the pool, Fletcher watches silently, then pushes his boat out into the deep water."
frank,"No.   I understand. Spector stiffens, then decides not to take this one on. SPECTOR Get your shit together and be out of here by noon. DEVANEY Frank stays. Spector looks round, sees that Devaney and Rachel have been listening. Rachel is silent. With a curt nod of his head, Spector gestures to the assistants to leave the room. Devaney weighs in."
devaney,"With this high a profile, Rachel needs protection now more than ever. If he goes, you can forget Miami... SPECTOR She's signed the fucking contract, Bill. You want me to read it to you? Rachel is watching them both. DEVANEY Fuck the contract. If he goes, she's not singing a note. It's too dangerous. SPECTOR Oh. 'Fuck the contract.' Great. Why don't you let Rachel speak for herself? I think she has some say in this. RACHEL  Mr. Schiller calling on line one... Spector ignores her, still holding his look at Devaney, Rachel and Frank. SPECTOR Well, I guess this is democracy in action."
rachel," Hang around, Farmer. We might need your vaunted expertise. She reaches forward and hits a button on Spector's desk, throwing the call onto a speaker."
rachel," Rachel, congratulations, you must be thrilled at the..."
rachel, Ben. I hear you've got me in the annex next to the kitchen.
thuringer,"Hi, Mark. MARK Hi. Frank smiles and nods to the nanny."
thuringer, Theirs is the only suite on the floor. The two men reach the service elevator and the emergency exit door at the end of the hall. Frank opens the stair- way door and goes inside. Thuringer follows.
thuringer,"As you asked, the rooms below have been kept vacant."
spector,"Yes.   It is. RACHEL Quit bitching, Farmer. This is the part you do get paid for. Rachel sweeps out the door.    The camera crew hurries to keep up with her."
rachel," I'm beginning to wonder about your judgement, Sy. Why do I have to keep paying my dues if I've already arrived?"
spector, ... I know you like to be reminded sometimes. Rachel looks away.   It's true.   He's good at his job.
frank,"Portman. PORTMAN Buy you a drink? FRANK Orange juice. It's been awhile. You on the job? PORTMAN  No kidding? I'd call that a step up from the President. Probably sings better too. RACHEL Thank you.   Thank you.   You're so right. SCATTERED LAUGHS. RACHEL I want everyone to have a good time and drink as much of Ben Schiller's liquor as you like. Rachel descends into the crowd, laughing and blowing kisses. PORTMAN Handful. Frank's look says if you only knew the half of it."
portman,"I heard you had to take someone out in New York. Frank remembers. PORTMAN I lost track of you after the Reagan thing. FRANK Yeah. PORTMAN It wasn't your fault, Farmer. You weren't even there."
portman,Greg Portman. RACHEL I take it you've met my bodyguard? PORTMAN We used to work together. RACHEL  'cause I'm the only one in the room who needs protection. She gives Frank a look and leads Portman into the crowd.
devaney,I don't know. I thought you were with her.
rachel,"Tony and I went over to Bal Harbour. Did a little shopping. Tony comes back, a smile playing across his lips.    Frank watches near the entrance."
devaney,We were worried.  You know you're not supposed to do that. Frank and Rachel look at each other.
rachel,"Farmer, you work here! Do you understand that? You work for me. DEVANEY Rachel. Frank turns and heads for the door.    Devaney looks at him anxiously. DEVANEY Farmer, where are you going? FRANK I'm gonna check the route.    As usual. He opens the front door. A uniformed guard is standing outside. Frank goes out and closes the door. RACHEL Did Fletcher call? Devaney, staring after Frank, shakes his head ""no."""
devaney,"She got another call, while you were downstairs and she answered it herself. It was him, Frank. Same guy. FRANK  Save it, Devaney. The people who hire me don't have to be convinced to save their own lives. Frank reaches the sliding door that leads to the balcony. FRANK Call me when she's ready to go down. DEVANEY Farmer -- Frank goes out on the balcony and slides the door closed behind him."
frank,"No Spector or Devaney or Tony. He looks at her, reading her face for any hesitation. There is none."
frank,"If you cross me up this time, I'll kill you myself. Rachel smiles, weakly but with obvious relief."
herb,You must be very successful to need Frank. Rachel smiles and looks out of the window. RACHEL It's so quiet here. HERB Frank came back and stayed six months after the Reagan thing. Rachel's questioning look encourages Herb. HERB Frank wasn't there the day he was shot. He never got over that.  We buried Katherine that day. Rachel looks out again at Frank and Fletcher in the boat.
henry,"Every time. FRANK Every time. In the distance, Rachel and Fletcher have just reached the house where Nicki scoops up Fletcher and spins him round and round in a circle. She hugs him close and kisses his hair.  After a few moments, Fletcher squirms free and runs to catch up with Rachel."
herb,"... And I never hit him. Ever. To this day.  That's very unusual for my people. So what happens? When he's ten years old, he complains about it? Can you believe that? FRANK Oh, for Chrissake! I'm going to tell her about the time you stripped in court."
herb,"His mother was the same way. Rachel smiles at him, thinking, then looks through at Frank in the kitchen, still peering out of the windows. Nicki watches Rachel."
rachel,"Well, that's it for me, I'm going to bed. She rises. Frank follows her up the stairs.   Nicki watches them go."
frank,"Why don't you change it? NICKI Is it that easy? Frank turns from the window to find Nicki blocking his exit. She moves close to him and kisses him, her hands on his shoulders. The kiss ends and they look at each other. FRANK You're a lovely woman. NICKI But you don't want me."
nicki,It's not so simple. FRANK Yes it is. You can walk out that fucking door anytime you want. I'll unlock it for you.
frank,"Where's Fletcher? Henry appears at the porch of the house, carrying a fishing rod as he comes out. At that instant, the sound of the OUTBOARD MOTOR CRACKLES through the air. Frank's head snaps toward the boathouse. Henry, in the distance, looks quickly at the boathouse, then to Frank."
henry," Frank! I haven't... But Frank is already moving, leaping from the porch and starting to run flat out toward the boathouse and dock. Rachel turns to look. The skiff appears out of the boathouse, Fletcher at the motor, the boat's lone occupant. The boat moves slowly away from the boathouse, parallel to the dock. Frank is running toward the water with everything he's got, his face contorted. The sound of the OUTBOARD drowns out his voice as he yells. FRANK Fletcher!   Fletcher! IN BOAT Fletcher, intent on his piloting, neither hears nor sees Frank running down the lawn behind him. The boat is approaching the end of the dock. DOCK Frank finally makes it to the dock and continues to sprint after the boat. His weight rattles the boards as he runs. IN BOAT Fletcher passes the end of the dock and gives the throttle a little twist. DOCK"
dock,"Henry and Rachel are already    at the end of the dock. Nicki and Herb are running toward    it. Rachel is livid, hysterical. Henry peers out at the boat,    which continues to bounce innocently across the water,    defining a broad curve. RACHEL Fletcher, baby. Are you all right? Baby. Fletcher, spluttering, is handed up to Rachel by Frank. Rachel hugs Fletcher to her. Herb bends down to check he's breathing properly, wrapping the boy in his jacket. HERB He's all right. Henry helps Frank up out of the water.    Frank sits on the end of the dock, breathing hard. RACHEL What are you doing? You out of your mind? You're crazy!  You could have drowned him! Frank and Henry look out toward the boat which has come to a stop out in the middle of the lake. FRANK I'm sorry.   I got careless. Henry looks at Frank.    He feels terrible about not checking the boat. HENRY Frank, I'm sorry. I should have..."
herb,"It's okay, Henry. Herb puts his hand on Fletcher's head. HERB You all right now, son?"
nicki," I think this is no maniac.   He knows what he's doing. There is a long, long silence.   Nicki continues crying. Finally -- NICKI You're right. He does. FRANK Tell me about it. She doesn't reply. FRANK Who is it, Nicki? NICKI He almost got Fletcher today... FRANK How do we stop him? NICKI ...my darling Fletcher... FRANK Who is it? NICKI"
nicki, He doesn't even know who hired him. He doesn't know who I am and I don't know who he is. FRANK How'd you do it?
nicki, Stay with Rachel! Henry's head appears round the doorway of Herb's room. 
fletcher,"Do you feel scared, Frank? FRANK Yeah, Fletcher, I do."
fletcher,"What are you afraid of? FRANK I think you should try to go back to sleep now, pal. FLETCHER Tell me, Frank, please. Is it the man who killed Nicki? Are you afraid of him? Finally, Frank turns and looks at Fletcher.    Frank is pretty far gone. He shakes his head ""no.""     He realizes that that kind of fear had never occurred to   him, and recognizing that fact sets him back into his   thoughts. FLETCHER Then what?    What are you afraid of? Frank doesn't have the will to resist anymore.    He lets his hand drop away from Fletcher. FRANK I'm afraid... of not being there... Fletcher stares at him, uncomprehending. FRANK It's late. Do you want me to take you back to your room? Fletcher shakes his head ""no,"" just barely.    Then he disappears."
frank,It's possible. RACHEL The Oscars?
frank,"Maybe. Rachel takes this philosophically.     She tugs at the grass, thinking. RACHEL When I was back in Squirrel Hill, I started betting my friends fifty bucks each that someday I'd win an Oscar. You can understand how important it is that they see me up there if I win. She looks at him and smiles. RACHEL If everyone of those pikers comes through, it could add up to a lot of money. FRANK I think it's very dangerous. RACHEL I know. But I can't stay up here on my hill forever. They are silent for awhile.     Rachel lies back on the grass, stares at the sky. RACHEL I didn't get to this place in my life by doing the smart thing every time.  I'll bet you have plenty. I'll bet you do. Nobody gets really good without it. And you're good. I know that. She sits up beside him."
rachel,"I don't know why all this has happened to me...  So... I'm going to go see if I win an Oscar. And I won't worry about it at all. Because I've got you to protect me. Frank almost smiles. FRANK That's right. He looks at her a long time, then takes her in his arms. He kisses her and lays her down. His body moves over hers. Like a bodyguard, protecting her from the night.  188   EXT. THE PANTAGES THEATRE - NIGHT                           188 The chaos and razamatazz of Oscar night.   Crowds, limos, cameras, searchlights...  189   INT. RACHEL'S LIMO - FRONT OF THE PANTAGES - NIGHT          189 The limo is waiting in a line of limos to reach the red- carpeted entrance to The Pantages Theatre. Frank and Tony sit in front with Henry. In the back a spectacularly-gowned Rachel sits flanked by Devaney and Spector, both of whom, like Frank, are wearing tuxedos.     Up ahead, they can all see the hubbub at the entrance: TV cameras, lights, photographers, arriving guests, two bleachers full of fans. The glare from the arc lights is almost blinding. DEVANEY We'll go straight back to the Green Room. Right, Frank? Frank nods. DEVANEY Got that, Tony? "
frank,"Tony knows what he's doing. Tony looks at Frank, surprised and not a little pleased with the unexpected support."
rachel,"I wish you boys would relax a little. Nothing bad's gonna happen out there, alright?  Unless I lose the fucking award. She looks around at the men, all are tense."
rachel,"Jesus, what a crew. Rachel leans forward and flips down the mirror on the panel in front of her and checks her appearance. The limo moves up. RACHEL Screw it. I'm through worrying. When your number's up, it's up. Right, Farmer? The limo is almost at the red carpet.   Frank slips out the front door of the moving limo."
clive,"I understand it's my great honor to escort you onstage. RACHEL That's right, Clive. And I don't like it one bit that you look skinnier than me."
tony," You can't use that thing back here. The  breakthrough's killing our radio mikes... We'll have to disconnect you. Reluctantly, Frank disconnects his earpiece."
clive,"The envelope. Rachel, shall I do the honors? INTERCUT -- RACHEL'S POV - CLIVE'S HANDS"
rachel,"Christ, what an idiot I am. Jesus. What the hell's the matter with me? Frank moves up closer, and exchanges looks with Tony, who is confused by Rachel's behavior. Rachel turns toward Frank and, in so doing, brings the man comforting her around to face Frank. It is Reardon. RACHEL Farmer, you've made me a raving lunatic. Frank barely hears Rachel, so struck is he   by Reardon's presence. Frank looks around them quickly    for Portman. Rachel looks at Frank with irritation and   turns back toward the Green Room. A production aide    signals Reardon. REARDON  Never heard of him. Reardon walks out on stage. Frank is left standing alone. All the weariness comes back, all his senses start to hum.
