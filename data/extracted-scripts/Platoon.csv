gardner, That what I think it is?
soldier 1, I guess so ...
sergent,"Okay, let's go ..."
veterans,"Well I'll be dipped in shit - new meat!  Sorry bout that boys - 'sin loi' buddy ... you gonna love the Nam, man, for-fucking-ever."
barnes,What are you waiting for?  He ain't gonna bite you. Move out.
harris,"Bravo Two, Six.  What's the delay up there, move it out on point.  We've got a link up at Phase Line Whiskey at One Eight Zero Zero, over."
lieutenant wolfe,"Two Bravo, Two move it out.  Six says we're jamming 'em up back there.  Over."
barnes,Tell that dipshit to get fucked.  Get that other freshmeat up here.  Gardner.
doc,You okay?
chris,Ants.  I got ants on my neck ... 
elias," You're humping way too much, troop, don't need half this shit.  I'll haul it for you but next time you check it out with me okay?"
king,You're a sick mother Bunny.
elias, Hold it up.
chris, I'm okay ... I'm okay.
francis,"Shit, King, it ain't d-e-r-e man, it's d-e-a-r, and Sara don't have no two r's in it, fool.  Shame on you."
king,"Don't matter, she knows what it means ... an she don't read too good nohow ..."
lerner,"Mumm, any time sweetheart."
elias,"Lerner, you'd choke to death on it."
captain harris,"Sky Six reports a fresh company of NVA moving across from Cambodia to this blue line.  You 'bush in this area near that ol' Buddhist temple we passed on the hump in.  Lt. Hawkins, you take this area in the rubber plantation..."
lieutenant wolfe, No problem sir ...
junior," Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man."
big harold, Fuck you bitch.
junior,"C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit."
big harold,"Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start your game playing with me Junior."
junior,Youse a pig man.  I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
big harold,De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
junior,"He's a fool alright but you a bigger fool.  Hey, whiteboy, watcha waiting for - dat hole ain't gonna dig itself ..."
big harold," That reminds me, I gotta take a shit."
junior,You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
big harold,Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
chris," ... the hardest thing I think I've ever done is to go on point, 3 times this week - I don't even know what I'm doing.  A gook could be standing 3 feet in front of me and I wouldn't know it, I'm so tired.  We get up at 5 a.m., hump all day, camp around 4 or 5 p.m., dig foxhole, eat, then put out an all-night ambush or a 3-man listening post in the jungle.  It's scary cause nobody tells me how to do anything cause I'm new and nobody cares about the new guys, they don't even want to know your name.  The unwritten rule is a new guy's life isn't worth as much cause he hasn't put his time in yet - and they say if you're gonna get killed in the Nam it's better to get it in the first few weeks, the logic being: you don't suffer that much.  I can believe that ... If you're lucky you get to stay in the perimeter at night and then you pull a 3-hour guard shift, so maybe you sleep 3-4 hours a night, but you don't really sleep ... I don't think I can keep this up for a year, grandma - I think I've made a big mistake coming here ..."
barnes,"Yeah, they got two Lieutenants and a Captain."
wolfe,Jesus.
barnes,Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad. 
elias,I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
elias," They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something."
elias,"Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know."
barnes,You get your men ready Elias ...
tex,"Shit, looks like rain.  All night too.  Gonna grow mushrooms in your bad-ass crotch Junior."
junior," Goddamn ain't no justice round here, you break your ass for de white man ... gonna get our act together, do some rappin' wid de brothers, change things ..."
crawford,"What's O'Neill have a nose up the lieutenant's ass already, how come we always get ambush."
francis,"Politics, man, politics.  We always getting fucked around here."
gardner,"Hey Chris, I show you a picture of Lucy Jean?"
chris, No ...
gardner, Yeah she's the one all right ... that's Lucy Jean. She's a-waiting for me.
chris," Yeah she's real pretty, you're lucky ..."
elias, Tex you got Junior and Taylor here on your position.
tex,"Damn, 'Lias this gun's boss.  Put Taylor someplace else."
elias,"You got Taylor ...  'Case somethin' happens to you, you get separated or lost don't yell out okay.  Sit tight.  We'll get to you."
barnes,"Okay, let's move out."
tex,"Taylor, you're on."

big harold,"You gonna be okay Taylor, okay, don't you start worrying now."

barnes," and that goes for you, shit for brains.  You don't SLEEP ON NO FUCKIN' AMBUSH.  Next sonofabitch I catch coppin' z's in the bush I'm personally gonna take an interest in seeing him suffer - I SHIT YOU NOT ..."
chris," I didn't fall asleep, Sergeant, Junior ..."
bunny, Shut your face chicken shit!  You in big trouble boy!
elias,"Knock it off!  We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks.  Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner."
junior," Let de white boy carry his ass, he this dude that got him fucked up.  Who'd be hauling his ass if that was a brother laying there?"
elias,Man'd be alive if he'd had a few more days to learn something.
king,"Hey Taylor, what's in the breeze?"

wolfe,"Don't worry about it Sergeant, he won't be able to prove a thing, he's a troublemaker but ..."
barnes,Elias' a waterwalker ... like them politicians in Washington.  Want to fight their war with one hand tied round their balls.  Ain't no time or need for a courtroom out here ...

rhah,That's what he is ... Baaaa!
king,"Love, yeah!"
lerner, Here we go again with the crazy preacher stuff.  Rhah seen too many movies.
rhah,"Baaa, got no time to go to the movies.  Love and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul."
chris,Where's Elias come from?
rhah, 'Lias come naturally.
lerner,"... don't know.  Done some time.  Heard he worked the oil wells in Oklahoma, made some bread and washed up in El Lay."
king,"Yeah, get married to some crazy El Lay bitch, an actress or somethin', she blew all his bread - LSD, gurus, all that California shit, and then she turns him into the cops on a drug rap."
rhah,Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
king,"So he got a reduced and come over here.  Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy.  Three years he been here."
chris,"Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes ..."
king,"Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back.  How you gonna talk to civilians man?  People back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -"
lerner," I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here.  My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this ..."
rhah,"Baaaa!  Fuck it, they sold us out - so what!  What'd you'all expect?  Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man.  They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies.  That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'.  Cause it don't really matter.  Don't mean shit.  So what!  Whatcha want - a parade!  Fuck that too!  No war time no grunt never got no respect.  Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man!  You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all.  Remember dat.  And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel ...  ... Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change ..."
chris,"... I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time."
elias,... don't feel like it either.
chris,... beautiful night.
elias,"Yeah.  I love this place at night.  The stars ... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there."
chris,That's a nice way of putting it.
elias, Barnes believes in what he's doing.
chris,"And you, do you believe?"
elias,In '65 - yeah.  Now ...  No.  What happened today's just the beginning.  We're gonna lose this war ...
chris, You really think so ... us?
elias,"... we been kicking other people's asses so long I guess it's time we got our own kicked.  The only decent thing I can see coming out of here are the survivors - hundreds of thousands of guys like you Taylor going back to every little town in the country knowing something about what it's like to take a life and what that can do to a person's soul - twist it like Barnes and Bunny and make 'em sick inside and if you got any brains you gonna fight it the rest of your life cause it's cheap, killing is cheap, the cheapest thing I know and when some drunk like O'Neill starts glorifying it, you're gonna puke all over him and when the politicians start selling you a used war all over again, you and your generation gonna say go fuck yourself 'cause you know, you've seen it, and when you know it, deep down there ..."
chris,Do you believe that stuff about ... knowing you're gonna die?
elias,"Yeah, those are the guys that live.  I really don't think Death gives a shit, it's like a giant garbage can, I think it takes whatever it can get ... you never know where it's gonna come from anyway ... so why spin your wheels?"
chris,"... You ever think about reincarnation, all that stuff?"
elias,"Sure, goes on all the time.  Maybe a piece of me's in you now, who knows.  But when you die - really die - that's a big return ticket.  ... yeah, a deer ..."
harold,"Shit, lookit this little fucker trying to get up ma glory hole."

chris,"You're wrong man!  Any way you cut it Rhah, Barnes is a murderer."
king,Right on.
rhah,I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.

rhah," Wrong?  You ain't EVER been right - 'bout nothing. And dig this you assholes and dig it good!  Barnes been shot 7 times and he ain't dead, that tell you something?  Barnes ain't meant to die.  Only thing can get Barnes ... is Barnes!"

king,"Way out of anything, man.  Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn.  How many days you short?"
chris,"Not just me ... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it!  We just don't add up to dry shit."
king,"Does a chicken have lips?  Whoever said we did, babe. Make it outta here, it's all gravy, every day of the rest of your life man - gravy.  Oh shit, superlifer!"
