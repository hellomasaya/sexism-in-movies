Speaker,Dialogue
darkness,"Which holds for an uncomfortably long moment, then... ""Money Never Sleeps"" graces the screen... and we move down below the letters to find..."
a chart,"Now filling the screen. It's of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It's for the year 2008 and it's down to the right... not good. A circle marks Friday June 13th. Follow a blue line back three days and stop. Another circle is now formed and Matthew Good's ""Giant"" rings out..."
midtown,"Opening titles... the workplace throng... listening to their iPods, checking their Blackberrys and sipping their Starbucks."
zabel,"Go ahead, open it. And across from Andrew Zabel sits JACOB L. MOORE... who holds his bonus check."
jacob,Really? On the wall over Zabel's shoulder runs an electronic ticker with the major indices and just one stock... ticker KZI... Keller Zabel Investments.
zabel,"Screw the credit derivative desk, I don't understand half the shit they do anyway. Zabel forces a smile. But Jacob can tell something's wrong with him."
jacob,Are you okay? Zabel doesn't answer... he just nods to the envelope.
zabel,Open it. He opens the envelope and looks down at the check.
jacob,"Thank you. And we get a good look at Jacob now... boyish features that display humility with a trace of mischievousness thrown in. He's definitely sexy, definitely cerebral and definitely winning."
zabel,"I'm proud of you, Jacob. And Jacob tries to play it cool as he looks up at the"
jacob,"Yeah, it's nice. But here's the thing... He looks around the store for a moment, then..."
salesman,"The ""fuck you"" room?"
jacob,Yes. The room where you sell me a fuck you ring for fuck you money.
salesman,The private client foyer. And with a big smile...
jacob,What did I say?
willy,"Jake, Glass Works is up nine points on earnings, you want to unload some?"
jacob,"Yeah, let's get closer to home. A trader named AUDRY turns to Jacob."
audry, Where's his hat? Willy glares at her.
willy,"Mind your own business, Audry."
audry,"I had to wear Pfizer on my forehead for a full week... so post it up, bitch. Willy pleads with Jacob..."
willy,"C'mon Jake, it's embarrassing. Jacob just shrugs..."
jacob,"The stock goes down, you wear the crown... them's the rules. Audry grins in victory. Willy shakes his head, grabs a marker, scribbles something down on a post-it then places it on his forehead. It reads ""I bought Toll Brothers at $24"" and he has to wear it all week. And Jacob laughs... now looking up at the electronic"
quant analyst,Girl like that cost a thousand bucks last year... now it's up to five.
jacob,Getting priced out of the hooker bubble? Confirming in frustration...
quant analyst,Goddamn bull market's killing my sex life. They all laugh.
derivatives trader, It's true. I'm actually shocked KZI gave you a bonus of that size.
jacob,Why? Private Equity CFO nudges Hedge Fund PM in reference to the woman who just took the seat at the next table...
quant analyst,"Really? The 787 is having problems. As Hedge Fund PM opens a bottle of Krug, Clos du Mesnil 1995 and pours it into the flutes."
jacob, Why? Why are you so shocked? Offering Jacob a flute...
jacob,We're not in serious trouble. It's a rumor. A woman takes the table next to them and this makes Derivatives Trader perk up and say.
derivatives trader,I think Goodyear Tire is definitely a buy. Hedge Fund PM checks out the woman.
quant analyst,Goodyear? The chart is horrible.
quant analyst," Oh, it's like a code. And Private Equity CFO turns to Jacob with..."
jacob,"Whatever, somebody was adding to their short. As a supermodel now joins the next table."
quant analyst,It's an exchange traded fund that tracks the Guinian Franc.
quant analyst,Gold Digger Freak Show. The guys just shake their heads...
jacob,"Can I ask you something, Robby? Robby nods."
robby,Huh?
jacob,You know what I mean. The amount of money you would need to fuck it all and walk away... if you wanted to.
robby,Do you want to walk away?
jacob,Not now. But one day... I don't know. When I have a family. It's just so consuming... so many marriages get
robby,Wall Street divorce lawyers do great in any market.
jacob,Exactly.
robby,Aha... when did you buy the ring? Jacob smiles at his friend's perception.
jacob,Last week.
robby,So when are you going to ask her?
jacob,I'm going to DC this weekend.
robby,Good. I like her for you. She's one of the good ones...
jacob,Sour grapes.
robby,"He's speaking at Columbia on Friday. If it's slow enough, a few of us might play hookie and check it out... he's the best show in town. And they continue to walk, until..."
jacob,Tell me what you hear. Robby slowly nods...
robby,"I don't think you want to hear it, bro. You worship Zabel and it's not good."
jacob,I don't worship him. He's done a lot for me and I've known him a long time. But he's been acting strange lately.
robby,That Keller Zabel is holding toxic waste they can't find a market for.
jacob,It's not true. It's rumors. There are hedge funds with huge short positions...
robby,"Jacob, you know better. You know it doesn't matter if they're rumors or not. And Robby stops walking."
jacob,I don't remember. Turning to Jacob with...
robby,"""An asset's value can only be priced at its perception."""
jacob,I said that? Robby confirms... then...
robby,So buddy -- it don't matter if the rumors are true or not. Because in this climate... if they exist at all... then most likely... Looking his friend head on...
diego,"J to the Acob -- morning to you, brother. Jacob smiles..."
jacob,Diego...
diego,"Okay, what's the best aphrodisiac on Wall Street?"
jacob,I don't know.
diego,"Jet fuel. Diego cracks up. Jacob just shakes his head and moves on. And Jacob walks uptown... deep in thought. It's a gorgeous June Friday. Suddenly, Jacob just stops walking and stands there for a long moment... coming to a decision. And as Jacob turns around and starts heading the other way..."
jacob,I'm here to see Andrew Zabel.
doorman,Is he expecting you?
jacob,No.
zabel,Jacob...
jacob,Andy. I'm sorry to come by like this but the rumors are now hitting a fever pitch and I wanted to make sure everything was okay. Zabel nods and heads for the door.
zabel,Come on...
jacob,Is everything okay? And Andrew Zabel doesn't seem all there... introspective and blank.
zabel,"I remember when the starter gave me this bushy hair twelve year old kid and I said; ""Donny, what the fuck -- give me a real caddy."" And he said; ""This kid's the best."""
zabel,"And you were. You had the wind down, the grade of every green."
jacob,What's going on?
zabel,But you wouldn't shut up about stocks. Twelve years old and you blabbed on and on about companies and sectors and earnings.
jacob,"Andy, are we going under?"
zabel,What was that piece of shit you loved? That airline equipment supplier who was branching out into car airbags--
jacob,Flour Controls. Are you okay? Zabel laughs.
zabel,Flour Controls... what a dog.
jacob,Why did you give me that bonus? Zabel stops walking and faces Jacob with...
zabel,"Because I know you, Jacob. And I know you've been holding off because you didn't think you had enough. We all do that... postpone life until we believe we have what it takes to actually live it."
jacob,There isn't a better money-runner on the street... we'll get through this.
zabel,"Marry her, Jacob. And have children with her and spend as much time as you can with them... and never forget that that's what's important. And Jacob L. Moore... looking his boss head on..."
jacob,"Andrew, if there's anyway I can help -- give back the bonus -- whatever... all you have to do is say the word. And Zabel just looks away..."
zabel,"There's just so much you don't know, Jacob."
jacob,Stunned... horrified... his universe becoming unglued. And he turns to Audry... helpless and in shock.
jacob,Who did this to us? She can only shrug... tears in her eyes. Jacob shifts his gaze over to the trading floor's electronic ticker on the wall... KZI $26.34... -$29.57. And he moves for the elevator banks... unable to take it anymore.
jacob,"Andrew, call me back. I'm going to find out who did this to us. I swear to God... if it's the last thing I do."
jacob,What? From the door...
jacob,It broke. Robby sharply nods.
robby,Dude... He stops short... swallows...
jacob,What?
robby,I just found this out and it hasn't hit the press yet. Once again... he stops short and looks away in frustration.
jacob,"What? Robby, what are you trying to say?"
robby,Andrew Zabel threw himself in front of the subway this morning. Jacob just stands in that doorway. No reaction at all. Absolutely frozen.
professor,Our speaker today has quite a checkered background in the world of finance. Some laughter from the room.
gordon gekko,No swagger in his step... not in a suit... hair not slicked back... but still looks fucking good. As he waits for the applause to wind down... and even a little longer... surveying every corner of the large room... commanding its full attention... getting it... holding the silence... until finally... he leans into the mic and says...
gordon gekko,"You're all pretty much fucked. The room breaks into laughter... Gordon smiles and waits for it to die down.  GORDON GEKKO  So greed has been redefined. Who knows -- maybe it was always like this and like everything else in this world, it's good and it is evil. Taking a moment to survey the room... "
gordon gekko, I'll give you six minutes then I really have to go.
jacob,"Mr. Gekko, can I speak to you for a moment? As he keeps walking..."
gordon gekko,"You're too late, Sport... Q&A's over."
jacob,My name is Jacob Moore and I'm dating your daughter.
gordon gekko,I'll give you nine minutes.
gordon gekko,"Keller, Zabel? Then you have my apologies."
jacob,Yeah...
gordon gekko,"Stock's in a free fall. My guess is that it just lost its Bar Mitzvah... Jacob quickly takes out his blackberry, turns it on and"
jacob,Andrew Zabel took me under his wing when I was in high school. He basically got me my scholarship to Yale then hired me right out of business school.
gordon gekko,"Andrew's smart, he beats the benchmarks consistently. He'll land on his feet."
jacob,He's dead. And Gordon stops walking and regards Jacob. Who confirms...
gordon gekko,I'm sorry to hear that.
jacob,He was a father to me.
gordon gekko,My daughter hasn't spoken to me for eleven years and you know it. She blames me for her brother's overdose and every other disaster that's fallen upon the world since the mid-nineties.
jacob,What?
gordon gekko,She hates me. And she hates Wall Street and everything it represents... so don't you find it curious that she would fall in love with you? And that slams into Jacob... who's frozen for a beat. Jacob finally snaps out of it then joins Gordon.
jacob,Yes.
gordon gekko,I guess I should know a little about you first. Where did you grow up?
jacob,Matinecock.
gordon gekko,I'm impressed.
jacob,It wasn't like that. I mean we didn't have much money. My mother was a tailor.
gordon gekko,And your father... what did he do?
jacob,"Disappear. And Gordon regards Jacob for a long moment, taking him in, until..."
gordon gekko,Clever. Jacob looks down the street.
jacob,Your town car. With a laugh...
gordon gekko,"Well, pal... As Gordon pats Jacob on the back..."
gordon gekko,She was eight in that one. It was taken in Egypt.
jacob,Can I... have it?
gordon gekko,What do I get in return?
jacob,"You... wanna make a trade? And Gordon thinks about, then..."
gordon gekko,Yes. I'll give you this picture and in return... I'd like a picture of Winnie... taken recently... without you in it.
jacob,"I don't have one on me. Gordon sighs, takes the picture out of his wallet and hands it to Jacob."
gordon gekko,Then I'll give you this one on margin.
platform,As they wait for the train... Jacob produces the ring box and opens it to show Gordon the ring.
jacob,I really did come to ask for your blessing.
gordon gekko,"No, you didn't. Nice ring... As the train arrives..."
gordon gekko,"Don't play me, Jake. You don't think I can see it in your eyes? You don't think I know that look?"
jacob,Smell what on me?
gordon gekko,Revenge. Jacob just looks away.
jacob,"You knew he was dead? ""Guardian Mortgage... Low down payments... Adjustable rates."""
gordon gekko,Like I said -- I still love to watch from home. And now Gordon turns to face Jacob with...
jacob,I know who.
gordon gekko,Really?
jacob,"It was either Nassim Tariq from the Frontier Fund, Bretton Woods from Locust or Karen Molina from ESL."
gordon gekko,Does Winnie even know you came to see me?
jacob,"Well, not exactly."
gordon gekko,"Not such a grand idea, Pal. Off Jacob's confusion..."
jacob,I'm going to bring them down. Whoever floated the rumor for a quick buck.
gordon gekko,"It's not worth it. It's a waste of energy and time. See, Jacob, nobody gets it... they never did. As the subway doors open..."
priest,"Andrew didn't have children, so he made all you -- all of us -- his children."
audry,Two dollars a share?
willy,The Fed didn't give us a choice. Jacob walks around the room... taking in the pictures of Andrew Zabel's life...
audry,Does that include the building?
daniel,What about the Zabel's institutional managed fund? How much is in that?
willy,Eight billion.
audry,And that's all intact.
daniel,"Jesus, United Bancorp made out like a bandit."
willy,We could've handled it at $60 a share or even $50. He just shakes his head...
daniel,Lemmings.
daniel,"Yeah, we're all out of a job. Jacob pulls away from the wall of pictures..."
jacob,My mother was a tailor. They all look at him.
audry,You're from Matinecock? I thought you didn't grow up with mon-- Jacob confirms...
jacob,We weren't rich. Everyone else was.
barbara,Jacob... Jacob takes her into his embrace...
jacob,"I was a fucked up kid, I was angry, my mother couldn't control me. He was the only one who cared. I wouldn't be anywhere right now if it wasn't for... And Jacob Moore stops short... finally breaking down... allowing his own tears to stream down his face. He pulls away..."
winnie,"Jacob, I'm so sorry."
jacob,Lehigh had the committee hearings and I knew he would need you and I didn't
winnie,That's not how this works. And she looks into his eyes.
jacob,Will you marry me?
winnie,What?
jacob,"I got a ring. Not on me, but--"
winnie,Are you proposing to me at a funeral?
jacob,Yeah.
winnie,He would've loved you doing this here. Jacob agrees. And she softly kisses him and squeezes him tight... tears in her eyes.
jacob,"By the way, I don't have a job anymore."
winnie,Awesome.
jacob's apartment,Winnie looks up from the ring.
jacob,Yeah...
winnie,It's too expensive. We'll return it.
jacob,No.
winnie,Jacob I don't care about what ring you give me. You know that.
jacob,We're not taking it back. I worked hard for that ring and I want you to wear it. She regards him... he's serious.
winnie,Okay.
jacob,Hey Audry. She looks up.
audry,I did.
jacob,Who are the big players in diabetes treatments?
audry,"Lilly, Abbot, OSI, Inverness."
jacob,Is anyone riding on something in phase three?
audry,Few midcaps maybe. You want me to check? He nods. She turns on her computer and takes a seat.
jacob,How did they die?
audry,I don't remember.
jacob,Pancreatitis?
audry,Yeah. That was it. Jacob shakes his head...
jacob,How did he know?
audry,Who? Without answering her...
jacob,Can you look up large institutional ownership?
audry,Mutual or hedge?
jacob,Hedge.
audry,Locust Fund owns a shitload. And she looks over to Jacob with...
jacob,"Want your severance, Audry? And he kisses her on the forehead..."
jacob,I don't know exactly but it's not something you wanna come down with.
jacob,Any day now.
evolution studios,While showering Jacob with quick jabs...
blogger,Where's your information from?
loft,Holding the wine he's supposed to be sampling but not drinking it...
jacob,A doctor that's very close to the trials... and that's all I can say.
christies,As they move on from the Polke...
evolution studios,As he removes his head gear and wipes away the sweat.
loft,As they receive the next glass of wine...
jacob,Your boy's coming up in the polls. Senator Lehigh nods.
senator lehigh,They're blaming this mess on the current administration... it's helping us. And some people say that the worst isn't over.
jacob,Her father. What's the word he uses... systemic. Winnie looks over to Jacob.
winnie,When did he say that? And Jacob takes for an extra long moment... holding her look... then comes to a decision and lies...
jacob,On Charlie Rose.
senator lehigh, Okay -- so when's the big date?
winnie,If he wins... she has a real chance for a cabinet position and I'm pretty sure she'll take me with her if she can.
jacob,He's going to win. As she hands him the glass of water...
winnie,Don't jinx it. And Jacob sees Amlyn Pharmaceuticals graphic on the screen and turns up the tv.
winnie,Can we watch something else? Jacob brings her in and kisses her...
jacob,Whatever you want. Her phone rings. As she goes to answer it...
jacob,Not Project Runway. Picking up the phone...
winnie,Hello... who is this? Hold on. As she pulls the phone away from her ear and looks over to Jacob...
jacob,I'm here to see Bretton Woods. The butler nods then leads Jacob through the full floor unit and into the...
bretton woods,"As you can see, I'm having a little dinner party here but I thought it was important we speak right away. He speaks with a British accent.. Jacob nods. Bretton looks over the room for a moment, scans his guests then back at Jacob..."
jacob,Do you collect?
bretton woods,No. Sitting behind his desk...
jacob,Your daughter's an amazing piano player. That was quite a show.
bretton woods,"That wasn't my daughter. That was Isabel Patrovsky, she's the world's greatest living piano prodigy."
jacob,No.
bretton woods,Who told you?
jacob,A doctor I know. Bretton nods... regards him.
bretton woods,I checked with all the desks in town... you didn't make money off it.
jacob,That's right.
bretton woods,Then why did you do it?
jacob,You destroyed my firm.
bretton woods,Your firm destroyed itself.
jacob,You killed Andrew Zabel.
bretton woods,Andrew Zabel killed himself. And Bretton sighs...
jacob,You made them true.
bretton woods,"No, Jacob, being levered thirty-eight to one in toxic debt made them true."
jacob,What?
bretton woods,I run three billion dollars. Come help me run it. And Jacob takes a beat... processing this...
jacob,Why me?
bretton woods,"Because your loyalty desired revenge, your balls actually attempted it and your skills pulled it off. As he stands..."
jacob,"You can have my answer now, Bretton... I have no interest in working for a fund that's in trouble. Bretton smiles..."
bretton woods,Touche. Jacob nods... holding Bretton's look. Then...
jacob,What's your number?
bretton woods,Excuse me?
jacob,The amount of money you would need to be able to walk away from it all and just live happily-ever-after.
bretton woods,More. ... and disappears into his penthouse.
diego,You know what I overheard a guy say yesterday?
jacob,I know you're going to tell me... Diego smiles...
diego,"""This market's just like a divorce. I've lost half my money... only I still have my wife!"" As he goes into the hot summer day..."
jacob,Not bad...
gordon gekko,There's a wait.
jacob,Oh...
gordon gekko,Fifteen minutes she said.
jacob,Okay.
gordon gekko,"No, that's not okay. Because it means they're crowded so every tier in the service chain will be extended. The sixteen minutes we would normally wait to order will now be twenty six, the standard twenty four minutes waiting for our food to arrive will turn into thirty nine, the eight minutes to get the check will become seventeen and the four minutes to process the credit card will take nine."
gordon gekko,Did you eat before?
jacob,Just not hungry.
gordon gekko,"Yeah... I used to not eat lunch too. Jacob nods and slides something across the table. The picture of Winnie in workout gear, flipping the finger. Gordon looks at it and laughs."
jacob,I actually owe you one now. Off Gordon's look...
gordon gekko,Did you?
jacob,His fund is bleeding. I wouldn't be surprised if the redemptions finish the job.
gordon gekko,"Well, Chief... you seem awfully proud of yourself."
jacob,How'd you know about Amlyn? Gordon shrugs.
gordon gekko,It's amazing what information you can find out when people know you're not going to trade on it.
jacob,"So, you didn't use me to make a little money? And never to look up from his lunch..."
gordon gekko,Naw. I prefer to write about the action now than be apart of it.
jacob,Why'd you give it to me?
gordon gekko,You're out of a job and most likely going to marry my daughter... I figured you could use the money.
jacob,I didn't make any money off of it.
gordon gekko,You didn't trade it? With a smile in and over-the-top faux innocence.
jacob,"That would've been insider trading, Mr. Gekko. Gordon just shakes his head."
gordon gekko,So did you take my advice and not tell your new fiance about our little friendship. Jacob doesn't say anything. And Gordon doesn't press.
jacob,Good guess.
gordon gekko,That's my Winnie. I knew she was a feminist when she was five and furious that Mrs. Claus didn't get enough credit. And this makes Jacob smile... then...
slick,"Gordon... Gekko nods. Slick hits his floor... ""PH."""
gordon gekko,You know it.
slick, Sells books I guess.
gordon gekko,"She refused to take that cowboy hat off. She actually slept in it. Smitten, Jacob looks at some more of the pictures then stands... taking in the large framed pictures on the wall. As Jacob checks out a framed chart for ""Gouda Tulip Bulbs Dec 1 1634 to Feb 5 1637."" The chart goes straight up and to the right then straight down in a single line."
jacob,Bretton offered to hire me.
gordon gekko,And did you accept? As Jacob moves over to an another piece.
jacob,Fuck no. Jacob now finds himself looking at a political cartoon from the early 1900s. It's of two men rowing a boat in a lake of dollars. One of the men is Uncle Sam dressed in US flag colors. But Sam's very small in this cartoon... can't really row the boat. The other man is much bigger and clearly doing the heavy rowing. He is...
gordon gekko,JP Morgan... he single-handedly stopped the Panic of 1907 by stepping in and buying up shares in all the companies that were crashing. Everyone else quickly followed like lemmings.  See -- people had stopped looking to their government or trusted advisors. They looked to JP Morgan. It was all about simple psychology -- every crash should have a JP Morgan to step in and save it. As they walk the hardwood floor...
jacob,That's horrifying.
gordon gekko,I know. As they both hold on the picture...
jacob,What caused it?
gordon gekko,A country in debt... that took on even more debt to fund a war... then printed mountains of money to avoid a depression and other financial imbalances... As he turns to face Jacob...
jacob,And you honestly think this is where we're heading? Looking Jacob head on... deadly serious...
gordon gekko,"If we don't take our heads out of the sand... yes. It's going to get bad out there, Champ, I'm not going to lie. Even the small regional bank I started out at might go under."
jacob,Hudson River Bank...
gordon gekko,That's right. And then...
jacob,What are you talking about?
gordon gekko,"What I'm talking about, Jake... is that I'd bet dollars to donuts that Bretton Woods unwound most of his position in Amlyn last week. That he knew about the pancreatitis. Off of Jacob's confusion..."
jacob,How do you know that?
gordon gekko,I don't. But it's not Bretton's first rodeo... and my instincts for this sort of thing don't often disappoint. Jacob can't believe it. And with each passing moment of realization... shock turns into rage.
jacob,I can't believe it.
gordon gekko,"Believe it, Princess... he's beating your ass all over the court. As Jacob tries to calm himself."
jacob,And you think I should take the job -- bring him down from the inside? Gordon confirms that with a simple shake of the head and...
gordon gekko,"I don't know, Jake... what you kids think is pay-back these days is really incredible. When I was coming up, we slaughtered men."
robby,"Jacob, I could lose my job. ... who holds his sleeping infant in his hands."
jacob,"Robby, I need to know. Now nobody moves size in this town without using your desk."
robby,Fire away...
jacob,Bretton Woods... The Locust Fund... did they make any major moves in the last few weeks?
robby,Yes.
jacob,Was it unloading Amlyn pharmaceuticals?
jacob,"Robby, I got you the fucking the job! And after a long moment."
robby,Yes. Jacob stops walking... sucks in a deep breath...
jacob,"I'm sorry to make you do that. With that, he disconnects and shakes his head in frustration. And after a moment, Jacob sucks in a deep breath then makes another call."
fireworks,Exploding over the Capitol building.
winnie,"My parents would always throw this huge party in the Hamptons on the fourth. The city of South Hampton would have its firework show at 8pm then my father would wait until it was over then put on his... which, of course, was always twice as spectacular. She leans up, sips her wine, then..."
jacob,What'd he do?
winnie,He rented a barge and shot the fireworks off of it a mile off the coast... out of jurisdiction.  The show was even more amazing over the water. And Jacob looks at her.
jacob,I think he should be invited to the wedding.
winnie,No.
jacob,"Winnie, he's your father... As the fireworks explode into their finale..."
winnie,You don't know him.
jacob,I know he's unhappy. Look at him out there... trying to scare everybody. He's desperate for attention.
winnie,This is none of your business.
jacob,"""That's not how this works."" Remember? She just looks away..."
winnie,"And that's what he deserves. Suddenly, everyone begins to look over to the house where something is happening..."
jacob,It was a long time ago. He stands and kisses her...
winnie,"C'mon, you can meet the next President of the United States."
six foot,Jacob... are you ready? Jacob stands and she leads him toward a bank of elevators. The doors open and Jacob gets on.
six foot,"Do you have everything they said you'd need? Jacob nods... holding a folder of his previous tax forms, his passport and other documents obviously needed for the job. And the elevator doors open... but not to an office... Jacob shields his eyes to the wash of daylight... then looks to realize that he's on the roof of the building. And in front of him is... An Augusta A109E Helicopter with ""The Locust Fund"" written on the side."
dining room,Where Bretton eats alone at the head of the long table.
bretton woods,Jacob. As Jacob walks through the expansive space...
jacob,Mr. Woods.
bretton woods, Bretton. ... and sits.
jacob,Okay... Bretton. I thought we were going to meet in New York.
bretton woods,And I thought you had no interest in working for a fund that was in trouble.
jacob,I was emotional. I was angry.
bretton woods,And what changed?
jacob,I caught a glance of my portfolio.
bretton woods,Dogue de Bordeaux... bred to kill. But Contango and Backwardation here are socialized since birth so they're harmless. Jacob laughs...
jacob,You named your dogs after technical futures market terms? And Bretton stands...
bretton woods,Of course not...  My children did. As he heads into...
jacob,And where are your children? Bretton moves toward a table with a classic phonograph player on it.
bretton woods,"Greece with my wife. My boys are studying The Iliad now. While Bretton looks through the various sleeves of records, Contango and Backwardation slowly find their way into the room and sit by the fire. Bretton finds what he's looking for... removing the record from its sleeve."
jacob,An asset's value can only be priced at its perception.
jacob,Thank you.
bretton woods,She's Gordon Gekko's daughter.
jacob,That's right.
bretton woods,He was a legend at one time. It's quite sad how he publicly cries out wolf now. Bretton stands and stretches.
gordon gekko,"Good work, kid -- you're on the inside now."
jacob,He's going to Dubai to raise some money then meeting me in New York to set me up. Gordon sits at the dining room table at his apartment. Papers scattered about and his EDITOR waiting patiently.
gordon gekko,No.
jacob,What?
gordon gekko,He's not meeting you in New York.
jacob,Why not?
gordon gekko,Because you need to go to Dubai with him.
jacob,I don't understand.
jacob,Looks better than meals I get on United.
bretton woods,John's Pizza on Bleeker. It crossed the Atlantic with you yesterday. Would you like a slice? Jacob declines... then...
jacob,Well -- there's a lot I can learn from you.
bretton woods,For this trip just stay in the background and observe. As Bretton tosses some pizza to Contango and Backwardation...
bretton woods,He's been after us for years...
bretton woods,Oh Jacob... you don't want to live in a glass house if you're gonna play this game.
jacob,I don't understand. Is he resigning?
bretton woods,Yes sir.
jacob,What'd he do? And Bretton simply turns to him and says...
bretton woods,Outsourced.
bretton woods,Remember. Hedge funds are not banking and this isn't Ivy-league-geography- ninth-hole deal making.
bretton woods,"Oleg's a brute, he's has A.D.D. and he likes to party. As they stop in front of large double doors... the BELLMAN opens the doors to reveal..."
bretton woods,"If he offers you a drink -- take it. And with that, Bretton points across the room where OLEG BAKUNIN sits."
oleg,Bretton Woods has arrived. Bretton smiles. They head over. Oleg turns to one of the MODEL GIRLS next to him.
bretton woods,A hundred and twenty-nine dollars a barrel.
oleg, Forget what I said -- I'm much richer than him. Oleg then looks at Jacob.
jacob,"Oleg, I'm Jacob Moore. It's nice to meet you. Oleg regards Jacob for a beat, then back to Bretton and asks again..."
oleg,Who the fuck is this? Bretton smiles...
bretton woods,Jacob has recently come over from KZI to work with me. And now Oleg turns to Jacob.
oleg,KZI? You worked with Andrew Zabel? Jacob takes a beat. Then...
jacob,That's right.
oleg,"He was a legend. Jacob just nods, not showing any emotion. Oleg motions for the girls to make room and they all sit..."
oleg,"5000 square feet, 30 days of oxygen capacity."
oleg,"Bretton, I have... what?... two hundred million with you."
bretton woods,"And hopefully that's just a start. Oleg, there are so many opportunities out there right now I feel like a kid in the candy store. Oleg waves him off."
oleg,You know I like to spread it around... I'm like my own fund of funds. I don't like to have too much with one manager. As Oleg shakes cocaine out of an envelope...
jacob,"I couldn't agree more, Oleg. It's one of the first things that Andrew Zabel taught me. I worked very closely with him. It's why Bretton hired me. To get behind the Andrew Zabel curtain. Bretton flashes Jacob a look... ""What the hell are you doing?"" Jacob swallows back some nerves then continues..."
oleg,Such as... ?
jacob,"Well, I'm not going to give you the whole cake, Oleg... He looks over to Bretton who still glares at Jacob..."
oleg,Interesting. ... then does another line.
nadia,We're here for the party. Confused...
jacob,What party?
paulina,Oleg said you needed a party... Cozying up to her friend with a smile...
nadia,"... and we're it. Jacob nervously thinks, then..."
jacob,Come in.
jacob,"I know... but if you're going to correctly utilize this technical head and shoulders strategy, you need to hold the stock until...  ... right here."
paulina,I always sell too soon.
jacob,Very common mistake. You need to cut your losers short and let your winners run. She looks to her friend with a smile...
nadia,Good advice for everything... no? Her friend agrees with a laugh. And Jacob checks the clock.
jacob,Okay. I think enough time has passed. I appreciate you guys keeping our little secret.
nadia,You must love her very much.
jacob,I do. Jacob opens the door to let them go but he hears a door open across the hall... Bretton's. And they all witness a YOUNGER AMERICAN WOMAN leave Bretton's room then head down the hall right by them. Jacob's stunned.
paulina,The most famous hooker in the world. Off Jacob's confusion...
jacob,Is she a gift from Oleg?
paulina,No. She's Bretton's go-to.
nadia,He flies her in wherever he's at. And Jacob slowly takes that in... absolutely floored.
bretton woods,You look like crap. They walk for the exit.
jacob,No Bretton. That was all bullshit.
bretton woods,"Well, it worked. Oleg's wiring us five hundred million dollars today. And Bretton turns to Jacob... impressed."
gordon gekko,"Well, I'm happy to help."
jacob,Oh... I'm still working on it.
gordon gekko,So you're a hedge fund cowboy now? Shaking his head...
office,A small cluttered office with papers strewn about...
jacob,Whatever. And they trade. The hotdog for the pretzel.
gordon gekko,As for your end of our trade.
jacob,Is that a threat? Looking Jacob dead on...
gordon gekko,Absolutely. Jacob just shakes his head with a laugh... now realizing that Gekko talked him into this position for this exact leverage.
jacob,"You're priceless, Gordon."
gordon gekko,Just be happy I'm on your team.
jacob,What bad position?
gordon gekko,"What have I been saying all along, Kid?"
jacob,Financials.
gordon gekko,They're a death trap -- mark my words.
jacob,Bring it. Diego smiles... loves this new one...
diego,What's the most dangerous question on Wall Street?
jacob,Tell me.
diego,"""How are you?"" And Jacob agrees whole-heartedly as he heads on his way."
jacob,Why are you with me? She stops and turns back to him.
winnie,What?
jacob,"You hate finance. You hate Wall Street. Why are you with me? Winnie nods. It's a valid question. And she thinks about it for a moment, then..."
winnie,Repetition compulsion.
jacob,Huh?
winnie,It's Freud.
jacob,"And what does it mean, psych major?"
winnie,"Well, it's when people repeat the same dysfunctional relationships from childhood in their adult life in hopes of trying to master them."
jacob,Like when children of alcoholics fall in love with alcoholics.
winnie,Yeah. He turns away... upset.
jacob,"That's great, Winnie."
winnie,"Jacob, that might be why I was initially attracted to you... but it's not why I love you. She moves to him."
jacob,"Nothing... As Jacob draws in a deep breath, collects himself and finally turns back to her with..."
jacob,Bretton... I found something I like. Bretton looks over to him.
bretton woods,I've been wondering when my new portfolio manager was going to come to me with something special.
jacob,I just wanted to make sure I would be bringing you the smartest idea possible. I know you don't go light. Confirming...
bretton woods,That's right. If I commit to this... we go large and we don't back down.
jacob,It might be better to do this in the office. I have color and support to
bretton woods,"C'mon Jacob, you know that's not how we do."
bretton woods,"This is how we do. And with a nod, the DRIVER of the other jetvan opens it to reveal two motorcycles inside. Bretton's MTT Turbine Superbike and an Agusta, these bikes are handcrafted works of art as much as they are demons of speed. Jacob laughs in disbelief and excitement."
jacob,And we're allowed to ride these through here? Sucking in the fresh summer air...
bretton woods,No.
jacob,Okay. I'm just getting used to it.
bretton woods,Tell me your idea.
jacob,Here?
bretton woods,Where else?
jacob,Right. Okay.
bretton woods,"No. After KZI, I took profits."
jacob,I think it's time to go the other way.
bretton woods,Banks?
jacob,Insurance companies. I'm talking the old school insurers that have become the babies thrown out with the bath water. Jacob waits for a reaction from Bretton. But all he gets is...
bretton woods,"Keep up! And with that, Bretton rips into the clearing. Jacob rides just as fast. They're neck and neck... it's definitely a race. Bretton pulls ahead but Jacob doesn't give up. As they move quickly toward a patch of forest with a only narrow trail entering it, Jacob focuses on the horizon and revs the bike into more speed. He pulls up next to Bretton as they approach the trail. If Jacob doesn't slow down, and fall in line behind Bretton, he's going to hit the trees. But he doesn't. Instead, Jacob blasts the bike into its final dose of speed, narrowly avoiding impact by zipping into the trail... pulling ahead of Bretton and taking the lead."
jacob,The basket of stocks I'm putting together focuses on reinsurance brokering and management services for businesses. They're trading below book and have large dividends.
bretton woods,Financials are a falling knife. Jacob nods...
jacob,I'm not arguing that... but the best opportunities are found where angels fear to tread. Jacob can see... he has Bretton on the hook.
winnie,He chose this restaurant. Jacob confirms.
jacob,You're going to be fine.
winnie,I'm only doing this for you.
jacob,No. You're doing this for you. She just glares at him.
winnie,We're never having sex again.
jacob,Then what my friends say about marriage will be true.
winnie,"Oh, shut up."
gordon gekko,Hi. Fighting back the nerves...
winnie,Hey. They just stand there. Jacob holds out his hand.
jacob,"Mr. Gekko, I'm Jacob Moore, we spoke on the phone. Nice to finally meet in person. Gekko just looks at him for an extra long beat, then... shakes his hand."
gordon gekko,Yes. They all sit.
jacob,I don't drink.
gordon gekko,Oh... okay. Then Gordon attempts a smile over to his daughter.
gordon gekko,"I've been following your career, Winnie. Senator Lehigh said some very nice things about you in The American Prospect interview."
winnie,Yeah. She's really been... very... supportive of my... And it trails off... as she just glares at Gordon.
gordon gekko,It's okay. This is a long term investment.
jacob,Winnie... Winnie... He turns her around.
winnie,You don't understand. Her tears being washed away by the rain.
jacob,"Your brother's dead, Winnie."
winnie,He's not the person people think he is.
jacob,It was a long time ago. She pulls out of his embrace...
winnie,He'll hurt us. Can't we just go home? Please... Jacob. It's raining. And he just looks at her for a long moment... soaking wet and shivering... crying and exposed.
jacob, I love you. You don't have to do this.
jacob,Yes.
bretton woods,Your insurance companies are down. He's working a coffee in the master suite of The Black Swan Home...
jacob,Bretton.
bretton woods,"I want to increase our size. Glancing at the LCD, 12:23am..."
jacob,Okay. Good. It's just a matter of time before they turn. I'll call the
bretton woods,"Jacob, I want you to triple our positions on all three."
jacob,Okay.
bretton woods,And they better fucking go up. Click. And as Jacob just looks at the phone...
gordon gekko,Tripling the size... that's a very aggressive move. Jacob nods.
jacob,"He's chasing. Suddenly, a MAN approaches the table. He's in his thirties."
tom,"Mr Gekko, I'm Tom Sanders. I write for Barrons."
gordon gekko,I've heard of it. Letting out a little laugh...
tom,I'm sure you have.
gordon gekko,Can you give me the cover? Tom isn't sure if Gordon's serious. Either is Jacob.
tom,"Well, I... um... don't make those decisions."
gordon gekko,Get me the cover and I'll give you seventy minutes. Tom politely smiles.
tom,I'll... take that as a no. ... and goes. Gordon looks down to his breakfast and quietly asserts...
gordon gekko, Both those assholes got the cover when they were convicted. And after a moment...
jacob,How do we know the insurance companies are going to continue going down? As he casually places his egg on a piece of toast...
gordon gekko,It's all going down. ... and takes a bite.
bill maher,Welcome to the 2008 Financial Follies!
sammy rosen,Doing well.
bill maher," Sammy, let me give you some free advice, the next time someone with bad eyesight wants to sell you a hundred and fifty million dollar painting... don't let them personally deliver it."
first frame,"Under the caption ""Main Street National Bank"" is a drawing of a Poor Man sitting across from a Banker Man behind his desk."
poor man,I'd like a mortgage... I don't really have any money though... is that cool?
banker man,Totally cool. Since housing prices are always going up it won't be a problem.
poor man,You guys are awesome!
next frame,"Under the caption ""A few weeks later at the bank..."" Banker Man now stands over a pile of steaming shit."
banker man,"Wow, these mortgages are really beginning to smell. I better sell them to smart people."

rich man,Fucked up.
norwegian man,What about the bank that made the original loan?
rich man,Totally fucked up.
norwegian man,What am I supposed to tell my villagers?
rich man,"That you fucked up. The final frame Just the rendering of that steaming pile of shit under the caption... ""The End."" And the lights go on to a some subdued laughter and a smattering of applause."
bill maher,What a year -- enjoy the night!
bretton woods,"It's a good question... what do you think, George? GEORGE, an investment banker at the table, thinks about it."
george,"The definition of rich... flying private. The table reacts... some agree, other don't. George turns to Jacob."
jacob,To be rich... is to have the love of a good woman. They all boo...
gordon gekko,"Isn't that what you always say, Bretton? Then... announcing to the table..."
bretton woods,Be careful Gordon...  ... your daughter's financial health is in my hands now. Jacob loses his smile... suddenly becoming uncomfortable.
gordon gekko,That's right.
bretton woods,"No, I don't suppose you did. Bretton looks over to Jacob."
jacob,"We have a proactive central bank, the charts show a clear bottom on July 15th and these companies are trading at half of what they were six months ago."
gordon gekko,"Just cause it's low don't make it cheap, Sport."
jacob,I read your book.
gordon gekko,It's not out yet.
jacob,I have a friend in publishing.
gordon gekko,"Since I have forty-four seconds to spare, I'm going to tell you a story. It's about a guy named Sam. And we go close on Gekko..."
diego,(doing his best Howard
bretton woods,"They're not going to save it. They're just going to let it bloody die! And sure enough... on the tv... Fox Business runs footage of Lehman Brother's demise. On the screen, the chyron screams:"
bretton woods,We're getting fucking killed. And Jacob looks up to his electronic ticker...
jacob,It's capitulation. Bretton holds Jacob's look... fighting to keep his composure. Until... he simply stands and offers Jacob his desk back.
bretton woods,Then buy more. Jacob takes his chair and reaches for the phone.
jacob,Right. Bretton just stares nervously at the electronic ticker... a frazzled gambler talking himself into his bet.
bretton woods,Fuck it.
jacob,"I'm sorry, you have an early train. I'm going to just go to the office now. She leans up."
winnie,He didn't want to keep my mother awake so he'd go into the kitchen and sit there. I could hear him because my room was right up the back stairs. I'd go and sit with him sometimes. We'd eat ice cream. Jacob gets out of bed and throws on his robe.
jacob,"It's not the market, Winnie. As he sits on the edge of the bed..."
winnie,"I wish I could tell you something was going to come along that would make it better but I can't. It's just going to take time, Jacob. A lot of time. And she looks into his eyes..."
jacob,"Go back to sleep. And he goes... After a beat, she sees Jacob's wallet."
winnie," Jacob, you forgot... She jumps out of bed, grabs the wallet and goes after him, but... it opens up and Winnie notices the picture inside. And she stops, staring at that picture. Her and her father on that white horse... taken years ago. A picture she knows she never gave to Jacob."
bretton woods,Face full of sweat... blood all over his hand... hair strewn about... completely out of breath... bloodshot red eyes... a beaten down mess of a man.
jacob,"What happened to composure, Bretton?"
bretton woods,"Well, I suppose it went to hell with your fucking insurance stocks. And Bretton calms down, walks to the window."
jacob,What?
bretton woods,It's time to call it a day. Spend more time with my family. I suppose this moment comes for all of us.
jacob,You still have six hundred million? Bretton vacantly nods. And Jacob Moore... trying his best to hide his disappointment...
bretton woods,I guess it's all relative. Bretton then takes a moment... confirming to himself that this is the right decision... then finally looks over to Jacob with...
jacob,He wants to close the fund... he wants to ride off into the fucking sunset...
gordon gekko,Okay...
jacob,"No, it's not okay... because we're so fucking close... and he's going to walk with six hundred million dollars and that's unacceptable. And Gordon sighs in defeat..."
gordon gekko,"I don't know what to tell you, Pal. You wanted to make him bleed, I wanted my daughter back... As he walks..."
jacob,"What happened to slaughtering men, Gordon? What happened to turning them into penny-ante brokers in Poughkeepsie? Gordon stops walking."
gordon gekko,Look at you. This can't possibly be the man my daughter fell in love with. Jacob turns away.
jacob,I want to finish the job.
gordon gekko,Why?
jacob,Because nobody gave a shit about me before Andrew Zabel came along. Because he didn't deserve what he got.
gordon gekko,"The universe is an efficient market, Kid... we all get what we deserve."
jacob,Did you? Now it's Gordon who looks away.
gordon gekko,I know you cared about him... and I know how that motivates. But Jacob... he wasn't such a Saint.
jacob,What's that supposed to mean?
gordon gekko,You don't want to know. Jacob steps forward... shouting out after him...
jacob,"I'm sorry she doesn't want anything to do with you, Gordon -- I'm sorry she doesn't love you! Gordon stops walking. Turns..."
gordon gekko,Okay Jake... you want to know. Jacob sharply nods.
jacob,No...
gordon gekko,"He would get people to invest with him by offering larger than normal returns then pay the old investors with the new investors money. As long as there was fresh money, he could keep going. Do you know what his name was, Jacob? It was Charles..."
jacob,You're lying.
gordon gekko,"I'm not, Son. I wish I were. Jacob just stands there... stunned with what he's hearing."
jacob,I know. But I do have something for you... And as Morgan Portfolio Manager leans forward in anticipation...
jacob,So I heard something earlier today...
blogger,It's so much better working out outdoors... that gym was so stuffy.
jacob,Not to mention expensive.
blogger,Right.
jacob,"So, you've obviously heard the rumor? And Blogger looks over to Jacob... he hasn't."
jacob,United Bancorp is going under. Wells Fargo has stepped up but the offer is insanely low.
bretton woods,I know all this.
jacob,You still have the fund and you still have the leverage that comes with it. You want out of the game... buy a bank. Bretton skeptically regards Jacob.
bretton woods,Why are you doing this?
jacob,Because I got you into those insurance companies... because I let you down... And Bretton... biting his lip in thought...
bretton woods,I don't like the mortgage toxic waste. It can't be quantified... and it spreads...
jacob,I worked it out already. You wouldn't have to take it.
bretton woods,How'd you do that?
jacob,"Well, Wells won't insure the Zabel institutional money. It's against their policy. And then..."
bretton woods,Then who would take on the mortgage securities?
jacob,Uncle Sam. Bretton slowly nods... taking all this in...
bretton woods,"So, I'd get the bank, the KZI assets including the institutional fund yet none of the mortgage securities. As Jacob leans forward... going in for the kill..."
jacob,"You could actually own the bank your father toiled away at his whole career. Think about that, Bretton. Bretton just shakes his head."
bretton woods,We're going to lose our credit. I'm facing margin calls.
jacob,So in order to stay in the game... we need fresh money. Bretton nods...
bretton woods," Oil's crashing. Jacob thinks for a moment, then..."
jacob,And how much do we need?
bretton woods,"Fifty, sixty million minimum... and that's just to hold off the current margin calls. And Bretton just sighs..."
jacob,Sit tight. I'm going to get us the money. And Jacob goes... Bretton calling out after him...
bretton woods,From who... ?
lady,"I have a question... what exactly is ""moral hazard?"" With a smile..."
gordon gekko,Short version -- taking risks you're not accountable for with other people's money. And the next person steps up and hands Gordon a copy.
jacob,He's going for it. We're almost home. As he signs it...
gordon gekko,There you go.
jacob,But he needs fresh money to serve the leverage. A hundred million. Gordon just shrugs.
gordon gekko,I'm a writer now. We don't make that much. As the line of people holding their new books start to get impatient...
jacob,"I know that, but I figured you might know how to get it. Handing Jacob back the signed copy..."
gordon gekko,"Well, if you need money that badly, Jake... you might want to check closer to home. Off Jacob's confused reaction..."
winnie,It's a lot.
jacob,How much?
winnie,"I don't know, Jacob. I never really considered it mine."
jacob,But it is... right? It's your money? And she faces him... regarding his urgency...
winnie, You might want to wipe some of the drool off your face...
jacob,I'm not kidding. This is important. As they continue to walk...
winnie,"Yes, it's mine. When he went to prison, my father put a lot of money in our names. And when Rudy died it all became mine."
jacob,Let's say I can figure out a way for you to get it. Take a loan against it -- something like that. Will you do that for me?
winnie,"Why are you doing this, Jacob? Jacob takes a moment... looking away with..."
jacob,"This is my only chance to make things right, Winnie. And she just regards him... not sure..."
hadley,Gordon couldn't invest any of his money so he put most of it into the children's names with directions on how it was to be invested.
jacob,And how could Winnie get it now? Hadley stops walking and thinks about it.
hadley,"Well, she'd have to sign a reversion of trust document. That way the funds would revert back to their pre-trust posture and regulations."
jacob,So all she has to do is sign a piece of paper?
hadley,Basically. As that registers...
jacob,How much is in there?
hadley,"It's complicated. There's private equity ownership, real estate, a very large position in a bank... all sorts of investment vehicles."
jacob,Ballpark it for me.
hadley,"I don't know. Assuming immediate liquidity... over three hundred million. And with that, Jacob sets to go. But..."
gordon gekko,You also would need the trust's executor to sign it.
jacob,Who is that?
gordon gekko,Sammy Redding. He's a lifelong friend. It won't be a problem.
jacob,What about you?
gordon gekko,"I would love to sign it, Jacob. Consider it done. Walking down 5th avenue..."
jacob,"Thank you. Thank you, Gordon."
gordon gekko,Just after you agree to two things.
jacob,Anything.
gordon gekko,"Before Bretton buys the bank, he must use all of Winnie's money and all the Locust Fund's leverage to go against the market. They're about to pass this bailout and I want to be on the other side of it."
jacob,But what about--
gordon gekko,It's just for a few weeks then it's right back to our plan.
jacob,Okay.
winnie gekko,As she starts to sign the forms... we're in...
gordon gekko,Winnie... come here... you're all I have left now. And she slowly walks over to him... to his embrace...
winnie,"You always get what you want, Dad. And Jacob Moore... witnessing this strange reunion... realizing how right she is..."
jacob," ... the financials, China, India, Brazil...  ""WORLD MARKETS SIGNAL DEPRESSION AHEAD"" "
jacob,What? No market joke today? Diego just shrugs...
diego,It stopped being funny. Jacob softly nods and heads on his way.
jacob,I thought you were in London. Jacob nods.
bretton woods,The United Bancorp deal is going to go through. I've begun unwinding all our positions.
jacob,But our deal with Gordon was that we have to stay short until November 5th. Bretton just looks at him.
bretton woods,"Jacob, Gordon redeemed all his money yesterday. We're clean with him. And this hits Jacob like a ton of bricks..."
jacob,"No. No, everything's great. Forcing out a smile..."
jacob,"Thank you, he hasn't answered his phone and we're very worried. The landlord nods and unlocks the apartment door for them..."
jacob,He played me... She joins his side...
winnie,I don't give a shit about the money. And she turns to face him.
jacob,I lied to you. I contacted him. I spent time with him. Without you knowing.
winnie,I knew.
jacob,You knew?
winnie,I saw the picture in your wallet.
jacob,Then why didn't you say anything?
winnie,Because I wanted to give you a chance to say something first.
hadley,"It's completely legal, Jacob. The funds reverted back to the pre-trust posture... that means the money was technically Gordon's again. Hadley just shrugs..."
jacob,But he's not allowed to trade.
hadley,He didn't trade.
jacob,"He put the money into the hedge fund, that's considered capital investment."
hadley,"Jacob, Gordon never put the money into a hedge fund. He simply took control of the bank."
jacob,Bank? What bank?
hadley,Hudson River. I told you about the position in the bank. Jacob's stunned...
jacob,Hudson River... ? I don't understand.
jacob,But how? Gordon wasn't allowed to control the trust.
hadley,That's right. All of the trust's moves were made by its executor.
jacob,Sammy Redding? Confused...
hadley,Sammy Redding? Who the hell is Sammy Redding?
jacob,So we're throwing Bretton's birthday party at Balmoral.
manager,"Well, we're very proud to have such a resounding success hail from these hallowed halls I assure you."
jacob,"That's funny because he often speaks about his days here at Redmayne and Bentley... anyway, what I'm hoping you can help me with were records of his early trades. Years ago."
manager,Of course... but it is against policy to allow just anyone to see those records.
jacob,I completely understand. How about this? I'll make you a trade.
jacob,"Wow, Bretton -- you really kicked some ass for client forty one. Finally Jacob turns to the back of the ledger, to the client key, where he moves the pencil down to client #41 and it says... Gordon Gekko."
oleg,"It's been a bitch of a month, my friend... tell me this visit does not bring bad news."
oleg,You want me to audit The Locust Fund?
jacob,That's right. I want you to tell Bretton you need the official records of all the fund's activity starting with when you gave him the original two hundred million. You need this because The Russian Federal Tax Service is up your ass and you have to play ball with them.
oleg,And if he declines... ?
jacob,You'll have no choice but to pull your money.
oleg,And why would I do that? And Jacob leans forward...
jacob,"Because if you do this for me, Oleg, I'll teach you the Andrew Zabel magic. I'll explain to you, in detail, all of his techniques... I'll give you all his secrets... it's less complicated than you might think."
jacob,"Hello... Okay, thank you. He moves to the curtains then opens them. And the daylight spills in."
oleg,"All the Locust Fund's trades for the last two years. Jacob nods, placing them into his bag. And Oleg lights a cigarette... looks right at us... excited... leaning forward with..."
jacob,They were working together. Your father and Bretton. Walking back into the apartment...
winnie,"Jacob, what are you doing here? Following her in..."
jacob,"Gordon wanted the trust the whole time. And when I came to him seeking revenge... he saw his window. Upset, she looks for her keys."
winnie,I have to go to work.
jacob,Bretton owed him a favor because he fed your father information twenty three years ago when he was a young broker in London and your father never ratted him out. She just looks at him... shaking her head... and not in disapproval... but in pity. But he keeps going.
winnie,That's the bank he worked at when I was born.
jacob,"Well, now he owns it. Or shall I say pilfered it before he went AWOL."
winnie,Jesus... And Jacob confirms...
jacob,He saw this coming years ago... from his cell. I'm guessing he made off with billions. And he throws something on the table.
winnie,"But what about the SEC, the regulatory agencies-- ?"
jacob,"The government is flying this 700 billion dollar airplane by the seat of it's pants. They don't know where half of the fucking money is going. And even if they did, do you think they want this out there? As this all washes over her..."
winnie,This is his revenge.
jacob,"Yup... sure beats the hell out of insider trading, doesn't it? And Winnie finds her keys and heads for the door..."
winnie,I can't hear anymore of this. ... but Jacob steps in front of her.
jacob,I'm done. I sold everything. The ring. Everything. I gave back the KZI bonus. I'm out and I'm broke and I deserve it. And she just looks at him...
gordon gekko,Did you see Barrons?
jacob,You finally got the cover. Gordon nods.
gordon gekko,The powers that be will never let that happen. Jacob's not arguing it...
jacob,"How much is enough, Gordon? Gordon laughs with a shake of the head."
gordon gekko,I've been asked that before...
jacob,You're not going to miss America?
gordon gekko,I'll always have America... it's why I'm here. I'm buying the island.
jacob,What happened to the precious depreciating asset of time?
gordon gekko,It still trades... And he turns to Jacob with a smile...
jacob,"I'm out, Gordon, I'm done trading."
gordon gekko,"I don't know why. You pulled it off, Kid, you took him down -- granted with my help -- but you atoned for Zabel's sins with Bretton's money."
jacob,Did you ever really want to reconcile with her?
gordon gekko, I'm human.
jacob,Then why did you do it? And Gordon... strongly holding Jacob's glare... simply replies...
gordon gekko,Same answer.
jacob,But it didn't work. Gordon sadly shrugs...
gordon gekko,I've been trying to wire two hundred million into her bank account but she won't accept it.
jacob,I know. She doesn't want it... we don't want it.
gordon gekko,"That sounds good. I bet you can even wrap it in a pretty red bow. But Champ, it's idealistic... and idealism kills every trade."
jacob,Winnie's pregnant. And Gordon stops walking.
gordon gekko,What do you want?
jacob,"It's bad out there, Gordon, people are panicked. They're not looking to their government. They're not looking to their trusted advisors. They're looking to you."
gordon gekko,You want me to buy? And Jacob Moore... slowly confirming...
jacob,Publicly and aggressively. Gordon just looks at him.
gordon gekko,We're far from the bottom. It'll be a dead cat bounce.
jacob,It'll buy us time. That's all I'm asking for... time.
gordon gekko,What do I get in return?
jacob,Full clemency.
gordon gekko,You can offer that?
jacob,Your daughter can. She works with the new Secretary of Treasury now. Considering that...
gordon gekko,What else?
jacob,"Winnie. Me. Your grandson. Something money can't buy... a family. And Gordon looks at him for the longest moments, allowing it all to register, then..."
gordon gekko,Sorry son -- that's simply a trade I cannot make. And as Gordon Gekko walks off... leaving Jacob Moore behind...
