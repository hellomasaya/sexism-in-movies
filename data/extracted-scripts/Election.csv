Speaker,Dialogue
jim,"Morning, Lowell"
jim,Twenty-one... twenty-two.
mother, Good luck!
tracy,"Good morning, Mr. McAllister."
jim,"Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?"
tracy, You know what they say about the early bird.
jim,"Yes, I do."
jim,"Well, good luck there, Tracy"
tracy,"Thanks, Mr. M."
paul,Stop daydreaming! Get back to work!
jim,"C'mon, wolverines!  Defense!  Let's hold 'em back!"
derek,"Uh, ethics is like when you, uh, do what society tells you is right and morals are like, uh..."
jim,"You're on the right track,  who can help him out?"
derek,..morals are when...
jim,Michelle?
michelle,"Morals are like lessons, you know, like the moral of a story; it's what you learn from a story or a fable or something. . ."
jim,Or a life experience.  Good.  And ethics?
michelle,"That's more like, urn... Ethics is how you use the morals... that you learn from a story?"
jim,Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
tracy, I know.
jim, Tracy.
tracy,Ethics are...
tracy, I'm just a girl who can't say no...
tracy,"I agree with Ashley.  We should rent the barrels at least a day beforehand. What happened last time was a travesty, I mean, we were --"
larry fouch," Yeah, no, I know, Tracy.  That's why we're -- Look, can we just take a vote on this?"
tracy,...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
dave,Her pussy gets so wet you can't believe it.
jim,Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
dave,She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
dave,"You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but..."
tracy,what?
dave,"Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner."
tracy,"No, I'm not. I'm just really busy."
dave,"I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to."
tracy,What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
dave,What kind of person?
tracy, Thank you.
dave,"And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness."
dave," Here, get down."
jim,You did it at your house?  Your own house?
dave,"Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love."
jim,In love?
dave,"Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel."
jim,But you haven't written your novel.
dave,That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
jim,"Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend.  What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop."
dave,"You're not just jealous, are you?  I mean, we both used to talk about her"
jim," That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral."
dave,"I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --"
jim,I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.
dave," Look, I appreciate your concern. I really do.  But like I said, I got it under control."
dave,Tracy's Mom -- she doesn't understand.
walt,"No, I'd say she doesn't.  I don't think I've ever seen a mother quite so upset. We're all very, very lucky she doesn't want this public."
sherry,Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
dave,Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
tracy,...certain time in history and
jim,Okay.  We'll pick up here next time
tracy,One per person!  Put those back I
doug schenken,Eat me
tracy,Ninety-seven.. .ninety-eight.
tracy,Mr. McAllister? Mr. McAllister! Wait up I
tracy,I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
jim,"Hey, that's super"
tracy,Here they are.
jim,You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
tracy,"Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning."
jim, Right
tracy,Aren't you supposed to keep them?
jim,"NO, that's fine"
tracy,I thought you were supposed to keep them.
tracy,Thanks for everything.
jim,You bet.
tracy, I can't wait to start campaigning.
jim,Should be easy.  So far no competition.
tracy,"Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one."
jim,"Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy"
tracy,"You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?"
jim,Sure
tracy,Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
jim,"Good luck, Tracy."
diane,Anything wrong?
jim,"Everything's fine.  Just, you know, school."
tracy's voice,"...You know, Coca-Cola's by far the number one soft drink... When I win the presidency we're going to be spending a lot of time together... a lot of time... lots and lots and lots of time... president and advisor. . ."
tracy,...harmonious and productive... close and special... you and I...  so close... so intimate... together...
paul,Why. . . ? Why. . . ?
jim,"Paul, could I talk to you for a minute?"
jim,"Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident."
paul,I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
jim,I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
paul,Yeah.
jim,"But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports."
paul,What do you mean?
jim,"Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?"
jim,Student... council... president.
paul,"Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --"
jim,"Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right."
paul,And she's super-nice
jim,"Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied."
jim,"Paul, what's your favorite fruit?"
paul,Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
jim,takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
jim,"Okay, let's say"
paul,"No, wait -- apples.  Apples."
jim,"Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy."
paul,I also like bananas.
jim,Exactly.  So what do you say?  Maybe it's time to give a little something back.
tracy,The right side is too high. The right side. Just a smidge.
paul,I gotta talk to him first.
tracy,Who put you up to this?
paul,"Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy"
tracy,Who put you up to this?
paul,What do you mean?
tracy,You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
paul,"No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --"
tracy,Thought what?
paul,"Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --"
tracy,So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
paul,"Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --"
tracy,"Okay, Mr. Popular.  You're on."
paul,Paul... Paul... power... Paul... Paul for President... progress... promise... peanut... Paul-i-tics... yeah... President Paul... Punt for Paul!  No.
tammy, What?
lisa,"I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?"
tammy,If you could just get out of your head.
paul,"Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today."
tammy,Don't you fucking knock?
paul,"Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa."
tammy,"Paul, get out!"
paul,So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
tammy, You dumbshit!
paul,What'd I do?
tammy,Lisa
tammy,Stop! Wait!
tammy,What...?
lisa,"I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting."
tammy,What?
lisa,People can see this.
tammy,So?
lisa,These are private -- these are for us.
tammy,I know.
lisa,But other people can see them too.
tammy,I don't care.
lisa,I've wanted this for so long.
paul,Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
lisa,Sorry.
diane,"Jim, don't.  You're scaring him."
jim,He likes it.
diane,Here.  Give him to me.  is little Darryl dizzy?  That's it. . come here. . .
diane,You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
jim,"Yeah, uh, just a minute"
diane,"Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up"
jim,"Yeah, just --"
diane,Could you hand me the remote?
jim,Sure.
jim,Here?
jim,Okay.  Give me the drill.
jim,"I'd always liked Sherry, but we'd never had a chance to spend any time alone together.  How with Dave out of the picture, I began to see what an incredibly sensitive and giving person she was."
jim,You look great
sherry,I can't afford this stuff right now.
jim,"Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little."
jim,So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
sherry,Should we get a what?
jim,points at the motel.
jim," Yeah. No. I mean, you know."
diane,What?
jim,"Well, Sherry's great.  But she can be a little much sometimes."
paul,"Tammy? Tammy, what are you doing?"
tracy,You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
jim,"Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down."
tracy,Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
jim,"As far as I know, they--"
paul,"We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?"
lisa,It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
jim,Anyone who gets signatures in on time can run.  And she got in just under the wire.  Nothing I can do.
tracy,Let me see them.  Let me see them
tracy,"These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one."
jim, Looks like Tim Kobza.
lisa,She's doing this to get back at me
paul,For what?
paul,For what?
lisa,I don't know.  You're her brother you should know.
tracy,Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
jim,"Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine."
jerry,"I love Millard High, and I will be a dedicated vice President. A vote for Jerry Slavin is a vote for good government. And even if I can't really stand up for you, I will.  Thank you."
jim,"Thank you, Jerry, and good luck. Again, Jerry is running unopposed for Vice President. So we'll move on now to the presidential race with three candidates running. The first in alphabetical order is Tracy Flick."
tracy,"Poet Henry David Thoreau once wrote, ""I cannot make my days longer, so I strive to make them better.""  With this election, we here at Millard also have an opportunity to make our high school days better.  During this campaign I have had the opportunity to speak with many of you about your concerns.  I spoke with freshman Eliza Ramirez, who told me how alienated she feels from her own homeroom.  I spoke with sophomore Reggie Banks, who said his mother works in a cafeteria and can't afford to buy him enough spiral notebooks for his classes.  I won't bore you with long- winded promises about all the new and innovative things I will definitely achieve during the year in which it will be my honor and privilege to represent each and every one of you, but I can say that my years of experience on the student council have taught me the three most important attributes the president needs to possess;  commitment -"
doug schenken,Eat me
walt,"If you can't be adults and give these candidates the courtesy they deserve, then you don't deserve to be called adults but children* Because that's what children are. And you'll be treated like children. So let's all listen up."
tracy,"The three most important attributes the president needs to possess are: commitment, qualifications, and experience.  I'll add one more; caring. I care about Millard, and I care about each and every one of you, and together we can all make a difference.  One of the things I would like to establish is a regular open forum where any student can come and voice their concern about issues we face here at Millard.  I and the rest of the student council would then interface with the faculty and staff, so a continuous dialogue would exist."
walt,I'd say she knows a thing or two about student-faculty dialogue.
tracy,"When you cast your vote for Tracy Flick next week, you won't just be voting for me.  You'll be voting for yourself and for every other student Our days won't be any longer, but they can sure be better.  Thank you."
jim,The next candidate for student body president is Paul Metzier.  Paul?
paul,As many of you know I broke my leg pretty bad thi3 year and the experience has made me reevaluate what I want to do with my life and that is help people when you think about it a school is more than a school it's our second home where we spend all cur time and grow as individuals and a community but is our school everything it could be I want our school to reach its true potential that is why I am running for president.
paul,I know what it is to fight hard and win like when we almost went to state last fall and I threw that fourth-quarter pass against Westside for the touchdown that won the game by three points I won't let you down like I didn't then I promise we can all score a winning  touchdown together. Vote Paul Metzier for president thank you.
jim,"Okay, Paul. Now our final candidate for President - another one of the Metzier clan -- sophomore Tammy Metzier."
tammy,Who cares about this stupid election?
tammy,0h don't vote for me I  Who cares? Don't vote at all!
walt,"That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up."
jim,"Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about."
ron,"All we need to do is send a message, so maybe we should just suspend her."
walt,Right.  That's it.  She's suspended for a week!
jim,I think that's a little strong Walt. Ron?
ron,We don't want to make a martyr out of her.  Three days sounds right to me.
walt,Okay.  Three days.  Take care of it.
tammy,Hey -- I said lights I
tammy,What do you want?
paul,"Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments."
tammy,"Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot."
paul,"Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same."
tammy,"Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings."
paul,Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
paul,"Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Right.  One other thing.  Since you know Lisa so well, could you give me some advice?  I want to get her something for helping me with the election.  You know, something really special -- like flowers or candy or flowers and candy.  Or is that too typical?  I mean, can you think of something? Something really special? You know, something she'd really like?"
tracy,"Eric, the ""r"" is supposed to be green, not blue."
tracy,That's okay.  I'm too busy.
tracy," Let's see... ""save"" is Command ""S."" Okay."
tracy,I didn't do this.  I didn't do it.
jim,There's your culprit
sherry, Dave.
sherry,Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
jim,"No, I... uh, didn't know that"
sherry,All his life.  He's tried everything.
jim, Still clear?
sherry,Yep.
jim,We'll let it run awhile
sherry,Hey Yeah?
sherry,Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
jim,Right now?
sherry,"Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter."
jim,Three twenty-five.
lisa,It's not fair.  It's not fair
paul,I just don't think anybody would do something like that on purpose.  It must have been some kind of mistake. Like a maintenance thing.
walt,"Jim, where the hell have you been?"
jim,Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
walt,Even tried you at home.  We've got a situation here.
lisa,"If Paul loses tomorrow, it's not fair. There has to be another election,  with posters."
jim,What's the problem?
walt,Somebody tore down their posters.
lisa,"Those posters cost a lot of money we don't have I  There's no time to make any more posters, there's no --"
walt,We'll get to the bottom of it.
paul," We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --"
lisa,It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
paul,"Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she..."
walt,"Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?"
jim," Oh yeah, you bet."
lisa,She should be expelled.  Or worse!
walt,You two just go back and focus on your studies.  Mr. McAllister's going to handle this.
jim,Tracy. Come on in. And shut the door behind you.
jim,I guess you know why you're here
tracy,"If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty."
jim,"A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it."
tracy,"Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!"
jim,Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
tracy,"I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so."
jim,6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
tracy,"I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this."
jim,"Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we ""interrogate?"""
tracy,"well, I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.  You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that."
jim,"You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself."
tracy,Why are you lecturing me?
jim,"This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand."
tracy,"I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay."
jim,"I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections."
tracy,"And I think certain older persons like you and your ""colleague"" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present."
jim,"Okay, Tracy.  Have it your way."
tammy,"You wanted to see me, Mr. M.?"
jim,Just wait outside. Tammy.
tammy,Okay.  But is this about the posters?
jim,Possibly.  Please just wait outside.
tammy,Okay.  Because I know who did it.  So.. I'll just be outside.
jim,"Tracy, don't go away.  Come in, Tammy."
tracy,This ought to be good
jim,So... what do you have to tell me?
tammy,"Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?"
jim, What is it. Tammy?
tammy,I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
jim,Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
jim,And when did you do it?
tammy,This weekend.
jim,Exactly when?
tammy,I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
jim,And how did you get in the school?
tammy,Door was open.
jim,Which door?
tammy,I don't know. All I know is I did it I
jim,I don't believe you.
tammy,I have proof.
tammy,"You don't know what it's like to grow up in the shadow of an older brother like Paul.  it's always Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul.  Never Tammy.  I'm only Paul's little sister.  You must be"
jim,"Final  I don't know what your problem is, but if that's the way you want it, that's the way it'll be.  I don't have time.  You're out of the election, and I'm turning you over to Dr. Hendricks."
tracy,Yes?
jim,Looks like today's your lucky day
tracy,What do you mean?
jim,You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
tracy,I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
jim,"That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?"
jim,"Pop quiz, everybody"
jim,"If you finish early, just sit quietly and check your work.  I'll be right back."
jim,"Okay, everybody, pass them forward. Stephanie, put down your pen."
jim,Sherry I
jim,Sherry
jim,"By any chance, has a woman shown up in the last half-hour or so?  Maybe she was looking for me."
employee,Nobody's come in here looking for anybody.  Just you.
jim,Are you sure?
employee, You okay?
jim,"Sherry, it's me.  Are you there? Pick up.  Okay, it's 4:32.  I came by at 3:25 like we said and waited, but you weren't there.  Anyway, I hope you're okay -- I'm worried about you. So now I'm just at the...  at the place we talked about. Suite 219.  So I'm here.  Everything's all set.  You can just come over.  Can't wait. Okay.  Bye."
dick metzier,"I don't get it.  What you have against your mother and me, against your brother Paul, is completely beyond me.  And your mother is extremely upset, she's at the end of her rope.  Your behavior gets crazier and crazier and wilder and wilder, and who knows what the hell else you're doing out there that we don't even know about?"
tammy,"Dad, I"
dick," Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!"
dick,What?
dick,You're going to Catholic school next year.  You're going to Sacred Heart. Maybe they'll straighten you out!
jim, Okay
tracy,"Dear Lord Jesus, I do not often speak with You and ask for things, but now I really must insist that You help me win the election tomorrow, because I deserve it and Paul Metzier doesn't, as You well know.  l realize that it was Your divine hand that disqualified Tammy, and now I'm asking that You go that one last mile and make sure to put me in office where I belong, so that I may carry out Your will on Earth as it is in Heaven. If elected I promise that I will pray more often.  Okay?  Amen."
tracy,Mom?
tracy,I think I'm going to lose today
tracy,You really think so?
tracy," Good morning, Mr. M."
jim, Mr. McAllister.  Mr. McAllister. Somebody tore down my posters. It's not fair.  It's not fair. Can I have an A? Can I have a recommendation?  Can I? Can I?
jim," Oh, yeah. Big day."
miss beeder,"Attention, everyone.  We have an important announcement from our principal. Dr. Hendricks."
walt,"Good morning, students.  It, uh, behooves me to inform you of an important change in today's elections. Effective this morning..."
saleslady,"And Sacred Heart is such a good school. Excellent school. The public schools are going downhill, as far as I'm concerned."
jo,"Well, we've had good luck at Millard, but for this one it's time for a change."
saleslady,So what do you think?  Sacred Heart has the prettiest.  They have that nice hint of purple.
tammy, I hate it.
jo,You're just going to have to get used to it.
tammy,"Please, morn.  Please don't make me go to Sacred Heart.  I beg you."
jo, We'll take two.
tracy,Tracy Enid Flick.
tracy,Phil you ready?
phil,Ready.
tracy, Just wait.
tracy,"Thanks, Phil."
paul,"Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?"
tracy, Yeah.
paul,"Hell, good luck!"
tracy," Good luck to you too, Paul."
paul,Thanks!
larry,"Okay, Mr. M."
jim,What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
larry,"Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts."
jim,"Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back."
larry,"You have the key, Mr. McAllister."
jim,Right.  I know.
jim,"I'm fine.  It's just a bee sting, a simple little everyday bee sting. Some people, they get stung, it's no big deal.  Me, I swell up.  Okay?"
larry,Okay.  Yeah.  We know
jim,All right.  I'll be back
jim,You're there.
jim,Sherry... I love you.
jim,It's the only true thing I know anymore.
jim,A mistake?  That was no mistake.
jim,Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
paul,"Hey, Mr. M. Big day, huh?"
jim, What d'you got?
larry,I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
jim,"You're kidding, right?"
larry,"I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --"
jim,"Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won."
larry,"It's a squeaker, Mr. M. I've got Tracy by a vote. Just one vote."
jim,"Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count."
dale,Sputnik.
dale,1958?
jim,Larry?
jim,I think we've got a problem.
walt,253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
larry,No way I It doesn't make sense.
walt,"Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy."
larry,"And 290 ""disregards,"" right?"
jim,Mostly Tammy fans
larry,"See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register."
jim,He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
larry,"But, they were there I counted 803 votes."
jim,"It happens, Larry. People make mistakes."
larry,I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was there when you sac down
walt,"Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going."
larry,"I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for."
jim," Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -"
walt,"Fouch, that's enough! End of story."
tracy,"Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you."
paul,"Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over."
tracy,Yeah.
jim,"If we could get started.  People! Once the winners are announced, we can all go home, okay?"
jim,"That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president."
jim,Paul Metzier!
paul,"Geez, you guys, thanks a lot.  I mean, wow, thanks.  I promise to do my best and really do a good job and be a good president.  And I want to thank Lisa Flanagan for being a super campaign manager. And I just want to say that I think Tracy would have made a great president too and that she really deserves a big hand."
jim,"And now, for vice-president."
jim,Could I get a...?
paul,"Wow! Mr. McAllister! This is so wild. We came to celebrate my victory, and I can't believe it. Here, these are my parents."
paul,This is great.
jim, JIM McAllister.
jo metzler," JO Metzier. You know, Paul just thinks the world of you. Oh, if you could just hear him..."
dick,"Yeah, say, apparently you've really come behind him, really helped him out there with the student council thing and all."
paul,I never would have ran if it wasn't for Mr. M.
jim,Paul doesn't need any of my help. He's going places.  You should be very proud.
jo,We are
dick,Having a problem with your eye there?
jo,Dick.
jim,Just a bee sting.
dick,You ought to get that looked at. Shot of cortisone or something.
jim,"Thanks, I'll be fine."
dick,"Anyway, we're awful sorry about what went on with our other one, you know, our Tammy."
jim,"Oh, she's not a bad girl.  She'll come around."
jo,"... but we've had some good talks, and I think we're sorting things out.  We're starting her at Sacred Heart in the fall."
jim,Good school.
dick,"Say, you're all alone,  why don't you join us?"
paul,Yeah!
jim,"Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home."
paul," Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff."
dick,"All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you."
jo,So nice
jim,You bet.
paul,"So, Mr. M,  I was starting to think about ideas for next year. I was thinking it would be cool to have, like a carnival.  With rides.  And, you know, it could be for, like. Muscular Dystrophy."
jim,"Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home."
paul,"Oh, okay.  Yeah, sorry."
jim,Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
tracy,One vote... one vote
barbara,"Why don't you take a couple of my pills, darling? You'll feel better."
jim,"Diane, I..."
jim,"Hi, Linda."
jim,Hmm?
jim,Oh.  Okay.
jim,You rang?
walt,"Mr. McAllister, I hope you can help us clear something up."
barbara,"Look at his face!  He knows he's been caught. Look at his face!  Your ass is grass, Mister!"
larry,"You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --"
paul,Huh?
paul,Senor presidente. Yo soy senor presidente... El grande presidente...
paul,Is Tammy okay?
walt,She's okay. It's about the election.
jim,"Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer."
jim,Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
tracy,Order.  Order.  Order I  Can we vote on this?  Those in favor.

tracy,My mother's buying me a new car for college.
jim,Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
tracy,"Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice."
jim,Good for you.  Good for you

jim,And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
tracy,That sounds good.
jim,So Tracy?
tracy,Yes?
jim,Why are you doing this?
tracy,Doing what?
jim,Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
tracy,"Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?"
jim,"Well, I... I... that's very nice of you."
tracy, I've got an idea.
jim,What's this?
tracy,My house.
jim,I don't understand.  What's the deal?
tracy,I want you to do something for me.
jim,"Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him."
tracy, I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
jim,"Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time."

jim,What a surprise.

jim,You'll be fine.
tracy,I hope so
jim,You will.
