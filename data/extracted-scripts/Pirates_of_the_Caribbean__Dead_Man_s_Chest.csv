Speaker,Dialogue
written by, Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio
port royal," [teacups on a table in the rain]  [sheet music on music stands in the rain]  [bouquet of white orchids, Elizabeth sitting in the rain holding the bouquet]"
elizabeth swann,Will...!
elizabeth swann,Why is this happening?
will turner,I don't know. You look beautiful.
elizabeth swann,I think it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
elizabeth swann,On what charges?
will turner,No!
elizabeth swann,*What are the charges?*  LORD CUTLER BECKETT I don't believe that's the answer to the question I asked.
will turner,Lord Beckett! In the category of questions *not* answered...
elizabeth swann,"We are under the jurisdiction of the King's governor of Port Royal, and you will tell us what we are charged with."
elizabeth swann,"*Captain* Jack Sparrow.  LORD CUTLER BECKETT Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, I thought you might."
black pearl, [views of rigging ropes and blocks aboard a ship at night]
gibbs,"Fifteen men on a dead man's chest. Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Drink and the devil had done for the rest. Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"
turkish prison," [tolling of bells, camera pans to show the crows flying toward a coastal island]"
jack sparrow,"Sorry, mate."
jack sparrow,Mind if we make a little side trip? I didn't think so.
black pearl," [Jack arrives at the Black Pearl in his coffin rowboat]  [Gibbs holds out his hand to help Jack aboard, Jack puts the skeleton leg in Gibbs' hand]"
gibbs,Not *quite* according to plan.
jack sparrow,"Complications arose, ensued, were overcome."
gibbs,"You got what you went in for, then?"
jack sparrow,Mm-hmm!
gibbs,"Captain, I think the crew, meaning me as well, were expecting something a bit more... *shiny*. What with the Isla de Muerta going all pear shaped, reclaimed by the sea, and the treasure with it."
leech,And the Royal Navy chasing us all around the Atlantic.
marty,And the hurricane!
crew,Aye.
gibbs,"All in all, it's seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating."
jack sparrow,Shiny?
gibbs,"Aye, shiny."
jack sparrow,"Is that how you're all feeling, then? Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving your best interests as captain?"
cotton's parrot,Awk! Walk the plank!
jack sparrow,What did the bird say?
leech,Do not blame the bird. Show us what is on that piece of cloth there.
jack sparrow,"Ohhh!  [Jack attempts to shoot the monkey with his pistol, his pistol misfires]"
gibbs,Know that don't do no good.
jack sparrow,It does me.
marty,It's a key!
jack sparrow,No! Much more better. It is a *drawing* of a key.
jack sparrow,"Gentlemen, what do keys do?"
leech,Keys... unlock... *things*?
gibbs,"And whatever this key unlocks, *inside* there's something valuable. So, we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks!"
jack sparrow,"No! If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks. So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?"
gibbs,So - We're going after this key!
jack sparrow,You're not making any sense at all. Any more questions?
marty,So... Do we have a heading?
jack sparrow,Hah! A heading. Set sail in a... mmm... a general... in *that* way - direction.
gibbs,Cap'n?
jack sparrow,"Come on, snap to and make sail, you know how this works. Come on, ?oy/?quick, ?oy/?quick, hey!"
marty,Have you noticed lately... The captain seems to be actin' a bit strange... -er.
gibbs,"Settin' sail without knowing his own headin'? Somethin's got Jack vexed. Mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow bodes ill for us all."
guard,"Lord Beckett. The prisoner as ordered, Sir."
will turner,More acquaintance than friend. How do you know him?
will turner,"What mark did he leave on you?  LORD CUTLER BECKETT By your efforts Jack Sparrow was set free. I would like you to go to him, and recover a certain property in his possession."
will turner,Recover. At the point of a sword?  LORD CUTLER BECKETT *Bargain*!  [Beckett goes over to a wooden box on a table and opens it]
will turner,Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment the same as being free.
will turner,So you get both Jack *and* the Black Pearl.
will turner,The property you want that he possesses.
black pearl," [Jack is using calipers on a map, using his left hand, a ""P"" brand mark is seen on his right arm]"
jack sparrow,Why is the rum always gone?
jack sparrow,Oh! *That's* why.
jack sparrow,"As you were, gents.  [Jack goes downstairs to the hold, an animal bleats, Jack unlocks the door, goes in]"
jack sparrow,"Ah!  [Jack pulls a sideways bottle from the rack]  [Jack pours sand out of the bottle]  [Jack drops bottle of rum in fright, the bottle breaks on the floor]"
jack sparrow,Bootstrap. Bill Turner.
jack sparrow,Is this a dream?
jack sparrow,"I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum."
jack sparrow,"I had some help retrieving the Pearl, by the way."
jack sparrow,Your son.
jack sparrow,And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?
jack sparrow,Who?
jack sparrow,"Ah. So it's you, then.  He shanghaied you into service, eh?"
jack sparrow,It's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment -
jack sparrow,Technic -
jack sparrow,"Yes, but the Flying Dutchman already *has* a captain, so there's re -"
jack sparrow,Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?
jack sparrow,"On deck all hands! Make fast the bunt gasket! On deck! Scurry! ?Scurry-on/?Marty, I want movement!"
jack sparrow,*I want movement!*
gibbs,Lift the skin up!
jack sparrow,All on deck! Run! And keep running! Run as if the devil himself and itself is upon us!
gibbs,Do we have a heading?
jack sparrow,Ah! Ooh! Run! Land.
jack sparrow,Oh! Euh!
gibbs,Which port?
jack sparrow,Didn't say port. I said land. Any land.
jack sparrow,"Agh!  [the monkey snarls at Jack, Jack snarls back at the monkey, in imitation]"
gibbs,Jack's hat! Bring 'er about!
jack sparrow,No no! Leave it! Run!
gibbs,Back to your stations! The lot o' ya!
gibbs,Jack?
jack sparrow,Shhh!
gibbs,"For the love of mother and child, Jack, what's coming after us?"
jack sparrow,Nothing.  small fishing vessel  [Jack's hat floats toward a small fishing vessel around sunrise]
turkish fisherman,"Heh-heh-heh.?tupayHey! ?Fo ?pes ?sa ?kapazun kapitan ?de ?la ?mezande, huh?"
greek fisherman,?Etora.
greek fisherman,Ah! ?Vangas ?da ?eroro ###
carruthers,Here now. He can't be here.
carruthers,"Mister Swann, -"
elizabeth swann,Jack's Compass. What does Beckett want with that?
will turner,Does it matter? I'm to find Jack and convince him to return to Port Royal. In exchange the charges against us will be dropped.
will turner,"Is that lack of faith in Jack, or in me?"
elizabeth swann,I have faith in you. Both of you. Where will you find him?
will turner,"Tortuga. I'll start there, and I won't stop searching 'til I find him. And then I intend to return here, to marry you."
elizabeth swann,Properly?
will turner,"Eagerly, if you'll still have me."
elizabeth swann,If it weren't for these bars I'd have you already.
elizabeth swann,I'll wait for you.
will turner,Keep a weather eye on the horizon.
weathered sailor,*Captain* Jack Sparrow? Owes me four dubloons. Heard he was dead.
giselle,Jack Sparrow!
scarlett,I haven't seen 'im in a month.
giselle,"When you find him, will you give him a message?"
shrimper,"Cannot say about Jack Sparrow. But dere's a island, just south of de straits, where I trade spice for... mmm... delicious long pork. Cannot say about Jack. But you find a ship dere. A ship wit' black sails."
cannibal island,beach
shrimper,My brother will take you ashore.
will turner,What's wrong? The beach is right there.
shrimper's brother,"?: Ne bougeais pas, c'est trop dangereux."
will turner,What?
shrimper's brother,"?: Je ne peux, c'est trop dangereux, j'avais le dit. Bon voyage, monsieur."
will turner,Jack! Jack Sparrow!
will turner,Marty! Cotton! Anybody?
cotton's parrot,Awk!
will turner,Ah! A familiar face!
cotton's parrot,Rawk! Don't eat me!
will turner,I'm not gonna eat you.
cotton's parrot,Don't eat me! No! Don't eat me! Akkk!
will turner,"Gibbs.  [Will follows the string attached to the canteen, over toward a large tree]"
will turner,Euh! Unh! Ya! Come on! Let's go! Euh! Ya! Come on! Who wants it? Unh! I could do this all day! Euh! Euh! Hah!
cannibal island,throne
will turner,Jack? Jack Sparrow! I can honestly say I'm glad to see you!
will turner,Jack! It's me! Will Turner!
jack sparrow,?: Wa-say kohn.
cannibal crowd,Eeseepi.
will turner,Tell 'em to let me down.
jack sparrow,Kay-lay lam. Lam piki-piki. Lam eensy weensy. Lam say-say... eunuchy. Snip-snip.
cannibal crowd,"Ahhh... eunuchy!  [Jack begins to walk away, as if disinterested, his Compass hangs from his waist]"
will turner,"Jack! The Compass! That's all I need, Elizabeth is in danger. We were arrested for trying to help *you*. She faces the gallows!"
jack sparrow,Say-say lam shoop-shoop sha smalay-lama shoo-koo. Savvy? Ball licky-licky.
cannibal crowd,Ball licky-licky!
cannibal crowd,"?Boom-shoo-boom, ?boom-shoo-boom, ?boom-shoo-boom..."
jack sparrow,Save me!
will turner,"Jack, what did you tell them? No! What about Elizabeth? *Jack...!*"
prisoners,...we don't bite...Come on...
elizabeth swann,Why don't you tell me what's happening?
elizabeth swann,No! Will has gone to find Jack!
elizabeth swann,He's a better man than you give him credit for.
elizabeth swann,A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.
mercer,"Evening, Governor.  Shame, huh? He was carryin' this. It's a letter to the King. It's from *you*."
mercer,"Where is she?  [Mercer grabs the governor by the lapels, pushes him up against the side of the carriage]"
port royal,"EITC headquarters  [darkened room]  [Beckett walks in from the balcony, carrying a lantern]  [Beckett walks to a table, opens a wooden box, finds the Letters of Marque missing]"
elizabeth swann,Then what is?  LORD CUTLER BECKETT I'm afraid that *currency* is the currency of the realm.
elizabeth swann,I expect then that we can come to some sort of understanding. I'm here to negotiate.
elizabeth swann,"These Letters of Marque, they are signed by the King?"
elizabeth swann,Or else I would not still be here. You sent Will to get you the Compass owned by Jack Sparrow. It will do you no good.
elizabeth swann,"I have been to Isla de Muerta, I have seen the treasure myself. There is something you need to know."
elizabeth swann,Consider into your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night.
elizabeth swann,"These aren't going to Jack.  LORD CUTLER BECKETT Oh really. To ensure Mister Turner's freedom, then? I'll still want that Compass. Consider that in your calculations."
ragetti,Well I say it was divine providence what escaped us from jail.
pintel,"And I say... it was me bein' *clever*. Ain't that right, poochie?"
ragetti,"?: Well how'dya know it ?weren't/?wasn't divine providence what inspired you to *be* clever? Anyways, I ain't stealin' no ship."
pintel,It ain't stealin'. It's *salvagin'*! And since when did you care?
ragetti,Since we're not immortal no more. We gotta take care of our immortal souls.
pintel,You know you can't read.
ragetti,It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.
pintel,Pretendin' to read the Bible's a *lie*! *That's* a mark against ya!  Look! There it is!
ragetti,What's got into *'im*?
pintel,Must've seen a catfish. Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.
ragetti,Stupid mongrel!
cannibal island,beach
pintel,Come on! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha... ###
pintel,It's ours for the taking!
ragetti,"Tide's comin', that should help. Well, salvagin' is saving, in a manner of speaking."
pintel,There's the truth of *it*! ###
ragetti,"Suppose we be'er... save it as soon as we can. What with our souls in such a vulnerable state, and all."
pintel,Amen to that.
cannibal island,throne
jack sparrow,"Thank you.  [Jack looks at the toe, bites off part of the nail to trim it]"
cannibal island,cages
will turner,Why would he do this to us? If Jack is their chief.
gibbs,"Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack their chief. But he only remains chief as long as he *acts* like a chief."
will turner,So he had no choice. He's a captive then as much as the rest of us.
gibbs,"Worse... as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos believe that Jack is a *god* in human form, and they intend to do him the honor of releasing him from his fleshy prison."
gibbs,?Argh! They'll roast him and eat him.
will turner,Where's the rest of the crew?
gibbs,These cages we're in... weren't built 'til *after* we got here.
gibbs,The feast is about to begin. Jack's life will end... when the drums stop.
will turner,"Well, we can't just sit here and wait then, can we?"
cannibal island,throne
jack sparrow,?No/?Oup! No no! ?Oy!/?Wait! No no! More wood! Big fire! *Big* fire! I am chief! Want big fire! Come on!
jack sparrow,?Oy!/?Boy! Maboogie snickel-snickel. Tout de suite! Come on! More wood!
cannibal island,Jack
jack sparrow,"Oh bugger.  [Jack drops his coil of rope, sprinkles paprika on his armpits]"
jack sparrow,Little seasoning. Eh?  [Jack is now tied up to a bamboo pole and hanging face down over a pile of wood]
jack sparrow,Well done.
cannibal island,cages
gibbs,"Put your legs through, start to climb! Agh!"
will turner,Come on men! It'll take all ?of-us/?the-rest to crew the Black Pearl!
leech,"Actually, you won't need everyone. 'Bout six would do!  Ohhh... dear."
will turner,Hurry!
will turner,Stop!
leech,Shhh!
cannibal island,throne
cannibal crowd,Ahhh! Fye-fye!
jack sparrow,"Well, go on! Go get them! Hay ala!"
cannibal crowd,"Hay ala!  Ala, ala!  [cannibals run off to chase after men who escaped from cages]"
jack sparrow,No! No no! Oy! No no!
jack sparrow,Not good.
cannibal island,cage
will turner,Cut it loose! Find a rock!
will turner,"Roll the cage!  [the cage rolls down the hill]  [the cage falls over the edge of a tiny cliff]  [the cage rolls down the hill, rolls up a coconut palm trunk, crashes to the ground, unbroken]"
will turner,Lift the cage! Hurry!
gibbs,"Come on, men! Lift it like a lady's skirt!"
cannibal island,hut
cannibal island,cage  [the cage rolls over a ledge into a small chasm holding a river]
gibbs,"This way, lads!"
cannibal island,Jack
cannibal woman,?A-geev-nee. Uh-boogie?
jack sparrow,Bugger.
cannibal island,beach
pintel,?Pull-loose/?Unloose the mooring lines! The mooring lines!
ragetti,?Thief/?Thing! Little hairy ?thief/?thing! Give it back!  Don't bite it!
pintel,?Unloose the mooring lines!
ragetti,He's got me eye! He won't give it back!
pintel,"Well, how'd you get it back last time?"
gibbs,Excellent work! Work's half done!
pintel,We done it for you! Knowin' you'd be comin' back for us.
gibbs,"?Make/?Making ?ready ?to?sail/?cast-off ###, boy."
will turner,What about Jack? I won't leave without him.
jack sparrow,"Hey!  [Jack appears at a distance, running down the beach toward the crew and ship]"
will turner,Time to go.
gibbs,*Cast off those lines!*
jack sparrow,Good doggie! ?Doggie.
jack sparrow,"*Alas*, my children! This is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost -"
jack sparrow,...Captain Jack... Sparrow.
gibbs,"Let's put some distance between us and this island, and head out to open sea."
jack sparrow,"Yes to the first, yes to the second, but only insofar as we keep to the shallows as much as possible."
gibbs,"Uh, that seems a bit contradictory, Captain."
jack sparrow,"I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Master Gibbs, now where is that monkey? I want to shoot *something*."
will turner,Jack.
jack sparrow,Ah.
will turner,Elizabeth is in danger.
jack sparrow,Have you considered keeping a more watchful eye on 'er? Maybe just lock her up somewhere.
will turner,"She *is* locked up, in a prison, bound to hang for helping *you*!"
jack sparrow,There comes a time when one must take responsibility for one's mistakes.
will turner,"I need that Compass of yours, Jack. I must trade it for her freedom."
jack sparrow,Mister Gibbs!
gibbs,Cap'n.
jack sparrow,We have a need to travel upriver.
gibbs,"By need, d'you mean a... trifling need, ?uh/?a... fleeting, as in say in a passing fancy?"
jack sparrow,"No, a... resolute and unyielding need."
will turner,What we need to do is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.
jack sparrow,"William... I shall trade you the Compass, if you will help me... to find *this*."
will turner,You want me to find this?
jack sparrow,No. *You* want you to find this. Because the finding this finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating and your discovering the detecting of a way to save your ?dolly/?dotty belle ol'... what's-her-face. Savvy?
will turner,This... is going to save Elizabeth?
jack sparrow,How much do you know about Davy Jones?
will turner,Not much.
jack sparrow,"Yeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth."
bellamy,"What's all this? If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have to share, and wear it one after the other."
bursar,"It's not like that, Sir. This ship is haunted."
bellamy,Is it now? 'N' you?
quartermaster,"The... female presence... amongst us, yes... all the men... they can feel it."
bursar,"I say... that we throw the dress overboard, and we hope the spirit finds it."
quartermaster,"No! That - that will just anger the spirit, Sir. What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs, and then just get it back!"
bellamy,"Enough! Enough! You're a pair of superstitious goats and it's got the best of you. Now this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway aboard. A young woman, by the look of it. I want you to search the ship and find 'er. Oh, and uh... she's probably naked."
will turner,Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?
gibbs,"Well, if you believe such things, there's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones. A fearsome creature with giant tentacles that suction your face clean off. And drag an entire ship past the crushing darkness. The Kraken!"
gibbs,"They say the stench of its breath is like - ooh! Imagine: The last thing you know on God's green earth is the roar of the Kraken, and the reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses. If you believe such things."
will turner,And the key will spare him that?
gibbs,Now that's the very question Jack wants answered. Bad enough even to go visit... *Her*.
will turner,Her?
gibbs,Aye.
bayou,Tia's shack
jack sparrow,"No worries, mates. Tia Dalma and I go way back. Thick as thieves. Nigh inseparable we are. Were. Have been. Before."
gibbs,I'll watch your back.
jack sparrow,It's me front I'm worried about. Mind the boat.
gibbs,Mind the boat.
pintel,Mind the boat.
marty,Mind the boat.
cotton's parrot,Awk! Mind the boat!
tia dalma,Jack Sparrow!
jack sparrow,Tia Dalma!
tia dalma,I always know de wind was goin' blow you back to me one day.
tia dalma,"You. You have a touch of... destiny about *you*, William Turner."
will turner,You know me?
tia dalma,You want to know *me*.
jack sparrow,There'll be no knowing here. We've come for help and we're not leaving without it.
jack sparrow,I thought *I* knew you.
tia dalma,Not so well as I had hoped. Come.
jack sparrow,Come.
tia dalma,What... service... may I do you? Hmmm? You know I demand payment.
jack sparrow,"I brought payment.  [Jack whistles once, a crewmember brings in the monkey in a cage]"
jack sparrow,"Look!  [Jack cocks his pistol, shoots the monkey, the bullet has no effect, but the monkey chatters in fright]"
jack sparrow,An undead monkey! Top that!
gibbs,No! You've no idea how long it took us to catch that.
tia dalma,The payment is fair.
jack sparrow,We're looking for this.  And what it goes to.
tia dalma,The Compass you bartered from me. It cannot lead you to dis?
jack sparrow,Maybe. Why?
tia dalma,"Ayeee... Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants! Or... do know, but are loathe to claim it as your own. Your key go to a chest, and it is what lay inside the chest you seek, don't it?"
gibbs,What *is* inside?
pintel,Gold! Jewels? Unclaimed properties of a valuable nature?
ragetti,"Nothing... bad, I hope.  [a jar of eyeballs is hanging next to Ragetti's face as he speaks]"
tia dalma,"You know of... Davy Jones, yes? A man of de sea. A great sailor, until he ran afoul of dat which vex all men."
will turner,What vexes all men?
tia dalma,"What, indeed."
gibbs,The sea?
pintel,Sums!
ragetti,Dichotomy of good and evil.
jack sparrow,A *woman*.
tia dalma,A wo-*man*. He fell in love.
gibbs,"No-no-no-no, I heard it was the *sea* he fell in love with."
tia dalma,"Same story, different versions, and all are true. See, it was a *woman*, as changing, and harsh, and untamable as the sea. Him never stopped loving her. But the pain it cause 'im was too much to live wid. But not enough to cause him to die."
will turner,What... exactly did he put into the chest?
tia dalma,Him heart.
ragetti,"Literally, or figuratively?"
pintel,He couldn't li'erally put his heart in a chest!  Could he?
tia dalma,"It was not wort' feeling what... small fleeting joy life brings, and so... he carved out him heart, lock it away in a chest, and hide de chest from de world. De keys, he keep wid him at all times."
will turner,You knew this.
jack sparrow,"I did not. I didn't know where the key was. But now we do. So all that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, hey!"
tia dalma,"Let me see your hand.  [Jack shows his right hand is untouched, but Tia unwraps the bandage on his left hand]"
gibbs,Uhhh! The black spot!
jack sparrow,"My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know."
tia dalma,"I am justMy little ###, where are you? ###"
tia dalma,"Davy Jones cannot make port. Cannot step on land but once every ten years. Land is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow. And so you will carry land wid you..."
jack sparrow,Dirt. This is a jar of dirt.
tia dalma,Yes?
jack sparrow,Is the... jar of dirt going to help?
tia dalma,"If you don' want it, give it back."
jack sparrow,No.
tia dalma,Den it helps.
will turner,It seems... we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman.
tia dalma,A touch... of destiny!  [Tia throws the crab claws down on the table to see how they fall]
will turner,That's the Flying Dutchman? She doesn't look like much.
jack sparrow,Neither do you. Do *not* underestimate her.
gibbs,Must've run afoul of the reef.
jack sparrow,"So what's your plan, then?"
will turner,"I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key."
jack sparrow,And if there are crewmen?
will turner,I cut down anyone in my path.
jack sparrow,"I like it. Simple, easy to remember."
ragetti,"Your chariot awaits you, sire! Ha, ha-ha-ha, ha-ha!"
jack sparrow,"Hey! If you *do* happen to get captured, just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt! Might save your life!"
ragetti,Bon voyage! Ha-ha-ha!
jack sparrow,Douse the lamps.
scuttled ship,"before attack  [Will goes aboard the ship, lantern in hand]  [Will passes one dead crewman at deck level, proped up behind net-like rigging]"
wounded sailor,...up the...
will turner,Sailor!
wounded sailor,...the stench...capsized...
will turner,Sailor!
wounded sailor,...bring a...
will turner,There's no use. You've run aground.
wounded sailor,"No! Beneath us! Foul breath!  [behind Will, a crewmember's body falls from a height, splashing into the water]"
will turner,Hey! Hey!
greenbeard,"Down on your marrowbones, and pray."
will turner,"Get back! Back!  [Will slices open the stomach of one of the invaders, fish spill out of it onto the deck]"
scuttled ship,after attack
maccus,Five men still alive. The rest have moved on.
davy jones,Do you fear death?  Do you fear that dark abyss? All your deeds laid bare. All your sins punished.  I can offer you... an escape-uh.
chaplain,"Don't listen to him!  [Jones walks over to the chaplain, takes the chaplain's head in his claw]"
davy jones,Do you not fear death?
chaplain,"I'll take my chances, Sir."
davy jones,To the depths.
davy jones,"Life is cruel.  Why should the afterlife be any *different*? I offer you a choice. Join my crew, and postpone the judgment. One hundred years before the mast. Will ye serve?"
helmsman,"I - I will, serve."
davy jones,?Grand.
davy jones,*You* are neither dead nor dying. What is your purpose here?
will turner,Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt.
davy jones,What is your purpose here?
will turner,Jack Sparrow. He sent me to settle his debt.
davy jones,"Huh! Did he, now? I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer."
jack sparrow,Oh.
davy jones,You have a debt to pay. You've been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years. *That* was our agreement.
jack sparrow,"Technically, I was only captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon."
davy jones,"Then you were a poor captain, but a *captain* nonetheless! Have you not introduced yourself all these years as *Captain* Jack Sparrow?"
jack sparrow,You have my payment. One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.
davy jones,One soul is not equal to another.
jack sparrow,"Aha! So we've established my proposal is sound in principle, now we're just haggling over price."
davy jones,Price? Pttt!
jack sparrow,Just how many souls do you think my soul is worth?
davy jones,"One hundred souls, three days-uh."
jack sparrow,"You're a diamond, mate. Send me back the boy, I'll get started right off."
davy jones,I keep the boy. A good-faith payment. That leaves you only ninety-nine more to go. Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha!
jack sparrow,"Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble, heroic, *terrific* soprano. Worth at least four... maybe three and a half. And did I happen to mention... he's in love. With a girl. Due to be married. Betrothed.  Dividing him from her and her from him... would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them be joined in holy matrimony. Aye?"
davy jones,"I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls-uh. But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this? Can you condemn an innocent man - a friend-uh - to a lifetime of servitude, in your name while you roam free?"
jack sparrow,Yep! I'm good with it. Should we seal it in blood? I mean... mm-mm - ink?
jack sparrow,Uh!
davy jones,Three days.  Three days.
jack sparrow,"Oh, Mr. Gibbs."
gibbs,Aye.
jack sparrow,"Uh, I feel sullied and unusual."
gibbs,And how do you intend to harvest these ninety-nine souls in three days?
jack sparrow,"Fortunately, he was mum as the condition in which these souls need be."
gibbs,Ah... Tortuga!
jack sparrow,Tortuga.
bellamy,"It's an outrage. Port tariffs, berthing fees, *wharf* handling, and heaven help us, pilotage. Are we all to work for the East India Trading Company, then?"
quartermaster,"I'm afraid, Sir... Tortuga is the only free port left in these waters."
bellamy,"A *pirate* port is what you mean. Well, I'm sorry. An honest sailor is what I am. I make my living fair, and I sleep well each night, thank you."
bursar,S-S-Sir!
bursar,She wants you to... do something.
bellamy,"She's tryna give a sign.  [the dress sweeps over a lantern, knocking it over and part of the deck ignites]"
bellamy,"Over there! Look for a sign!  [the crew rush to the railing and look out at the sea]  [Elizabeth, up on the mast overhead, sighs in exasperation]"
quartermaster,Look there! There it is. There's the sign.
quartermaster,S-Seaweed can be a sign.
elizabeth swann,What's that over there?
gibbs,And what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?
elderly man,"Truth be told, I never sailed a day in me life. I figure I should get out and see the world while I'm still young."
gibbs,You'll do. Make your mark. Next!
jilted man,My wife ran off with my dog. And I'm drunk for a month. And I don't give a ass rat's if I live or die.
gibbs,Perfect! Next!
gibbs,It's the crow's nest for you.
jack sparrow,I know what I want.
gibbs,Next!
romantic man,"Ever since I was a little lad, I've always wanted to sail the seas. Forever."
gibbs,Sooner than you think. Sign the roster.
romantic man,Thanks very much.
jack sparrow,How we going?
gibbs,Including those four? That gives us - four!
gibbs,And what's *your* story?
norrington,"My story... it's exactly the same as your story, just one chapter behind. I chased a man across the Seven Seas. The pursuit cost me my crew, my commission, and my life."
gibbs,Commodore?
norrington,"No, not anymore, weren't you *listening*? I nearly had you all, off Tripoli. I would have, if not for the... hurricane."
gibbs,Lord. You didn't try to sail through it?
norrington,"So do I make your crew, or not? You haven't said where you're going. Somewhere *nice*!"
norrington,So am I *worthy* to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow?
norrington,"Or should I just kill you now?  [Jack ducks back and forth behind both sides of a large post, as Norrington points his pistol at Jack]"
jack sparrow,You're hired.
norrington,Sorry. Old habits and all that.
jack sparrow,Time to go?
gibbs,Aye!
jack sparrow,"Thanks, mate.  [Jack slaps him on the shoulder, the man falls backwards off the balcony]"
jack sparrow,"Carry on.  Heave!  [the two men throw the carried man off the balcony, then Jack continues on his way]"
norrington,"Come on, men! Who wants some? Form an orderly line, I'll have you all one by one. Come on, who's first?"
elizabeth swann,I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself!
elizabeth swann,James Norrington.  What has the world done to you?
will turner,Step aside!
davy jones,Will you now? And what would prompt such an act of charity?
davy jones,Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha! What fortuitous circumstance be this! Five lashes be owed. I believe it is.
davy jones,"The cat's out of the bag, Mister Turner. Your issue will feel its sting be it the Bo'sun's hand, by your own."
davy jones,"Bo'sun!  [Bootstrap reluctantly takes the whip]  [two crewmen tear Will's shirt off, exposing his bare back]"
will turner,I don't need your help!
will turner,So I'm to understand what *you* did was an act of compassion?
flying dutchman,below deck  [Bootstrap and Will enter the interior of the ship together]
will turner,I've sworn no oath.
will turner,Not until I find this. The key.
wyvern,The deadman's chest.
will turner,What do you know of this?
wyvern,"Open the chest with the key, and stab the heart. No-no-no-no. Don't stab the heart. The Dutchman needs a living heart, or there'll be no captain. And if there's no captain, there's no one to have the key."
will turner,"So the captain has the key.  [Wyvern retracts his head back into the wall, having said too much]"
will turner,Where *is* the key?
wyvern,Hidden.
will turner,Where is the chest?
wyvern,Hidden.
elizabeth swann,Captain Sparrow!
jack sparrow,"Come to join me crew, lad? Welcome aboard."
elizabeth swann,I'm here to find the man I love.
jack sparrow,"I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea."
elizabeth swann,"Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow."
jack sparrow,"Elizabeth.  Hide the rum.  [Gibbs takes the bottle that Jack hands to him, and walks up the boarding plank in the background]"
jack sparrow,"You know, these clothes do not flatter you at all. It should be a dress or nothing. I happen to have no dress in my cabin."
elizabeth swann,Jack. I know Will came to find you. Where is he?
jack sparrow,"Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this but... through an unfortunate and *entirely* unforeseeable series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor William has been press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew."
elizabeth swann,Davy Jones?
norrington,"Oh, please. The captain of the Flying Dutchman."
jack sparrow,You look bloody awful. What are you doing here?
norrington,You *hired* me. I can't help it if your standards are lax.
jack sparrow,You *smell* funny.
elizabeth swann,Jack. All I want is to find Will.
jack sparrow,Are you certain? Is that what you really want most?
elizabeth swann,'Course.
jack sparrow,"Because I would think, you'd want to find a way to *save* Will the most."
elizabeth swann,And you have a way of doing that?
jack sparrow,"Well, there is a chest..."
norrington,"Oh, dear."
jack sparrow,A chest of unknown size and origin.
pintel,What contains the still-beating heart o' Davy Jones.
ragetti,Unh-unh... unh-unh... unh-unh...
jack sparrow,"And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including... saving brave William from his grim fate."
norrington,"You don't actually believe him, do you?"
elizabeth swann,How do we find it?
jack sparrow,With this. My Compass... is unique.
norrington,"""Unique"" here having the meaning of broken."
jack sparrow,True enough. This Compass does not point north.
elizabeth swann,Where does it point?
jack sparrow,It points to the thing you want most in this world.
elizabeth swann,Oh Jack! Are you telling the truth?
jack sparrow,"Every word, love. And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?"
elizabeth swann,To save Will?
jack sparrow,By finding the chest of Davy Jones.
jack sparrow,Mister Gibbs!
gibbs,Cap'n.
jack sparrow,We have our heading.
gibbs,"Finally! Cast off those lines, weigh anchor, and prow that canvas!"
jack sparrow,Miss Swann.

greenbeard,Agreed.
will turner,I understand.
will turner,"It's a game of deception. Your bet includes all the dice, not just your own."
will turner,What are they wagering?
will turner,So any crewman can be challenged?
will turner,I challenge Davy Jones.
davy jones,I accept ?that-uh.
davy jones,The stakes?
will turner,My soul. An eternity of servitude.
davy jones,Against?
will turner,I want this.
davy jones,How do you know of the key?
will turner,"That's not part of the game, is it? You can still walk away."
davy jones,What's this?
will turner,No! Don't do this.
davy jones,Four fours.
will turner,Four fives.
davy jones,Seven fives-uh.
will turner,Eight fives.
davy jones,"Huh huh huh. Welcome to the crew, liar."
davy jones,"And be called a liar myself for my trouble? Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar and you will spend an eternity on this ship! Master Turner, feel free to go ashore... the very next time we make port!"
will turner,Fool. Why did you do that?

will turner,They'll know you helped me.
will turner,I take this with a promise. I'll find a way to sever Jones' hold on you. And not rest until this blade pierces his heart. I will not abandon you. I promise.
gibbs,Beckett!
elizabeth swann,"Yes, they're signed, Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company."
jack sparrow,Agh.
gibbs,"Will was working for Beckett, and never said a word."
jack sparrow,Agh.
gibbs,Beckett wants the Compass. Only one reason for that.
jack sparrow,Of course. He wants the chest.
elizabeth swann,"Yes, he did say something about a chest."
gibbs,"If the company controls the chest, they controls the sea."
jack sparrow,"A truly discomforting notion, love."
gibbs,And bad. Bad for every mother's son what calls himself a pirate. I think there's a bit more speed to be coaxed from these sails. Brace the foreyard!
jack sparrow,Might I inquire how as to how you came by these?
elizabeth swann,Persuasion.
jack sparrow,Friendly?
elizabeth swann,Decidedly not.
jack sparrow,"Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor. Yet you're the one standing here with the prize. Full pardon, commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company. As if I could be bought for such a low price."
elizabeth swann,"Jack, the Letters, give them back."
jack sparrow,No. Persuade me.
elizabeth swann,You do know Will taught me how handle a sword.
jack sparrow,"As I said... Persuade me.  [Elizabeth walks away frustrated, leans on the ship's railing]"
norrington,It's a curious thing. There was a time when I would've given anything for you to look like that while thinking about me.
elizabeth swann,I don't know what you mean.
norrington,"Oh, I think you do."
elizabeth swann,"Oh, don't be absurd. I trust him, that's all."
norrington,So you never wondered how your *latest* fianc ended up on the Flying Dutchman in the first place?
bellamy,Strange thing to come upon a longboat so far out in open waters.
will turner,Just put as many leagues behind us as you can. As fast as you can.
bellamy,And what are we running from?  [Will sees Elizabeth's white wedding dress on a chair in the cabin]
will turner,That dress. Where did you get it?
bellamy,It was found aboard the ship. The crew it thought it was a spirit bringing some omen of ill fate.
will turner,That's foolish.
quartermaster,"Oh, yes. ?Proceededly foolish."
bursar,It brought good fortune! The spirit told us... Put in at Tortuga. And we made a nice bit of profit there.
will turner,I imagine... some of your crew may have jumped ship there.
bellamy,Why do you ask?
messenger sailor,"Captain, a ship's been spotted."
bellamy,Colors?
messenger sailor,She isn't flyin' any.

koleniko,First?
davy jones,Who sent that thieving charlatan onto my ship? Who told them of the key? Jack Sparrow.
jack sparrow,My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.
elizabeth swann,I just thought I'd be married by now. I'm so ready to be married.
jack sparrow,"You know...  Lizzy... I *am*... captain of a ship. And *being* captain of a ship, I could in fact perform a... marriage. Right here. Right on this deck. Right... *now*!"
elizabeth swann,"No, thank you."
jack sparrow,"Why not? We *are* very much alike, you and I. I and you. Us."
elizabeth swann,"Oh. Except for a sense of honor, and decency and-and a moral center. And personal hygiene."
jack sparrow,"Trifles. You *will* come over to my side, I know it."
elizabeth swann,You seem very certain.
jack sparrow,"One word love: curiosity. You long for freedom. You long to do what you want to do because you want it. To act on selfish impulse. You want to see what it's like. One day, you won't be able to resist."
elizabeth swann,Why doesn't your Compass work?
jack sparrow,Uh my Compass works fine.
elizabeth swann,"Because you and I *are* alike, and there will come a moment when you have a chance to show it. To do the right thing."
jack sparrow,I *love* those moments. I like to wave at them as they pass by.
elizabeth swann,"You'll have the chance to do something... something courageous. And when you do, you'll discover something: that you're a good man."
jack sparrow,All evidence to the contrary.
elizabeth swann,I have faith in you. Want to know why?
jack sparrow,"Do tell, dearie."
elizabeth swann,Curiosity. You're going to want it. A chance to be admired. And gain the rewards that follow. You won't be able to resist. You're going to want to know... what it tastes like.
jack sparrow,I *do* want to know what it tastes like.
elizabeth swann,But - seeing as you're a good man I know you will *never* put me in a position that would compromise my honor.
elizabeth swann,"I'm proud of you, Jack."
jack sparrow,I want my jar of dirt.
pintel,You're pullin' too fast.
ragetti,You're pulling too slow. We don't want the Kraken to catch us.
pintel,"I'm savin' me strength for when it comes. And I don't think it's Krack-en, anyways. I always heard it said Kray-kin."
ragetti,"What, with a long A?"
pintel,Aye.
ragetti,"No-no-no-no-no-no-no. Krock-en's how it's pronounced in the original Scandinavian, and Krack-en's closer to that."
pintel,"Well we ain't original Scandinavians, are we? Kray-ken!"
ragetti,"It's a mythological creature, I can calls it what I wants."

elizabeth swann,Will! You're alright! Thank God! I came to find you!
jack sparrow,How did you get here?
will turner,"Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them, strapped to my feet."
jack sparrow,"Not so easy, is it?"
will turner,"But I do owe you thanks, Jack."
jack sparrow,You do?
will turner,After you tricked me onto that ship to square your debt with Jones.
elizabeth swann,What?
jack sparrow,What?
will turner,I was reunited with my father.
jack sparrow,"Oh! Well... you're welcome, then."
elizabeth swann,"Everything you said to me... every word, was a lie!"
jack sparrow,"Pretty much. Time and tide, love."
jack sparrow,Oy! What're you doing?
will turner,I'm gonna kill Jones.
jack sparrow,"Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now. If you please: The key."
will turner,"I keep the promises I make, Jack. I intend to free my father. I hope you're here to see it."
norrington,"I can't let you do that, either. So sorry."
jack sparrow,I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.
norrington,"Lord Beckett desires the contents of that chest. I deliver it, and get my life back."
jack sparrow,Ah. The dark side of ambition.
norrington,"Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption."
elizabeth swann,Stop it!
elizabeth swann,Jack!
will turner,Guard the chest!
elizabeth swann,*No*!
elizabeth swann,"This is bar-*baric*! This is *no* way for grown men to settle - ! Oh! Fine! Let's just - *pull* out our swords and start *banging* away at each other! *This will solve everything!* I've had it! I've had enough! Wobbly-legged, rum-soaked... *pirates*!"
pintel,How'd this go all screwy?
ragetti,"Well, each wants the chest for hisself, don't 'e? Mister Norrington, I think he's tryna regain a bit of honor. Old Jack's lookin' to trade it, save his own skin. And Turner there - I figure 'e's tryna... settle some unresolved business 'twixt him and his twice-cursed pirate father."
pintel,Sad. That chest must be worth more 'n a shiny penny.
ragetti,Oh! Tsk-tsk-tsk. Terrible temptation.

Who was it, who at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to *free* said pirate, and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, hey? So who's fault is it, *really*, that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?"
norrington,"Enough!  [Jack somersaults off the roof to escape, Norrington turns to Will]"
