Speaker,Dialogue
revie,I'm just going to make a brief statement.
clough," ""And let me play among the stars.."""
simon,When are we there?
clough,"Any moment now. On the right.  ""Let me see what spring is like..."""
boy 1,There it is! Dad! There it is! The BOYS smile in excitement.
clough," ""..on Jupiter and Mars.."""
boy 1,Where are you going? Dad? You've missed it.
clough,We've something else to do first. Won't take long. 
3,"4   CON TINUE D:                                                   4 CLO UGH  ""In other words, hold my hand. In other words, darling kiss me..."""
mitchell,"Today we welcome Brian Clough as he starts his new job as manager of Leeds United, taking over from Don Revie - the most successful manager in the club's history, under whom Leeds have won everything.. CLOUGH ..not QUITE everything. Not won the European Cup..."
mitchell,...but pretty much everything else. Daunted?
clough,"Daunted? Not at all, Austin. Looking forward to it."
mitchell,"The biggest challenge of your life, and you'll be without Peter Taylor, for the first time. Your lifelong professional colleague."
clough,"Yes, Pete's at Brighton now. He had the opportunity to come with me, but Brighton was his choice. Leeds was mine."
mitchell,"A surprising choice, some might say. Because you've been very vocal in your criticism of them over the years."
clough,I have.
4,5    CON TINUE D:                                                5
mitchell,"You've accused players of dirty tactics, cheating, dissent, foul play. You called Norman Hunter, Norman ""Bites yer legs"" Hunter, you've said Peter Lorimer falls when no one touches him..."
clough,And I was right.
mitchell,I'm curious. Why do you now show such alacrity to joining them after such vituperative criticism of them for so long?
clough,"Goodness, it's going to take me half an hour to explain all those words for a start."
clough,"Football clubs are like families, footballers are sensitive people. I'd like to bring a little warmth into the set-up..."
4a,5B   CON TINUE D:                                                     5B
mitchell,"""That type of operation?"" I presume you're referring to Don Revie.."
clough,I am..
mitchell,"..who has long been regarded as a father figure in Leeds. And now you're coming in as the outsider, the enemy even, after all the things you've said in public, coming in and taking ouver as STEPfather."
5,5D   CON TINUE D:                                                  5D
mitchell,Don't you expect some degree of resentment to this?
clough,"I would accept and expect a strangeness, initially, it's   perfectly normal. But it won't be long   before they realise I'm a fair man.   A kind man. And maybe under me they   can experience what it's like to   be in a happy family, after all."
mitchell,How can you be sure they weren't happy with Don all along?
clough,They wouldn't have played football that way if they were happy.
jimmy gordon,"Where have you been, boss?"
jimmy,Directors have been waiting more than an hour. C'mon..

clough,Morning lads! Lovely Yorkshire weather!  I tell you makes me want to jump on a plane right back to Majorca!
jimmy,You're five days late!! And did you really need to say that about Majorca?  You know he was Revie's first choice for getting your job.
clough,Who? Johnny Giles?
jimmy,Club Captain. Don's son and heir. His first born. You're never going to get any love from him.
clough,Great. Here's to happy fucking families.
clough,"Any chance of a cup of tea, duck?"
jean,They're waiting for you. Upstairs.
clough,Who's that? JEAN The Directors.
clough,For me? Why?
jean,For the board meeting.
clough,"Let them wait. Now, how about that cup of tea?"
jean,"Yours, Mr. Clough."
clough,"Not mine. I didn't put it there, did I?"
jean,Mr. Revie's.

clough,"Let's get rid of it then, shall we? Chairs, too. The whole bloody lot. Think it would be best if there were nothing of his left here."
jean,I was. For thirteen happy years.
clough,"What's your name, pet?"
jean,"Jean, Sir. Jean Reid. CLOUGH In which case, no offence duck, but there's nothing I want typed on paper from you other than your resignation."
cussins,"Come in, Brian."

clough,What? No one going to offer me a drink? Like an undertakers in here.
cussins,Why did you do it?
clough,Do what?
bolton,The interview. For Yorkshire TV.
cussin,We've had a phone-call.
bolton,Not so much a phone-call. Bloody tirade.
cussins,"From Don. They only went and rung him. And ran some of your quotes by him. About how unhappy the players were. What ""bad champions"". Looking for a response."
bolton," Bloody got one, as well. He's gone berserk."
clough,He had it coming. He shouldn't have done that piece in the Mirror should he? Saying he thought I was a daft choice.
bolton,He's entitled to his opinions.
clough,And I'm entitled to mine.
cussins, And I'm entitled to MINE.
10,10   CON TINUE D:                                                  10
clough,"Thank you. I'm the best old one, too."
cussins,...I also did it under the assumption that you'd be coming here wanting the best for the club. For the city of Leeds. So why do I still get the feeling this is all about you and Don?
clough,"Of course it's just about me and Don. Always has been. But instead of putting frowns on your foreheads, o ye elders of Leeds, in your blazers and brass fucking buttons, it should put big white Colgate smiles on your big white faces, because it means I won't sleep and won't eat until I take whatever that man's achieved and beaten it -- beaten it so I never have to hear the name ""Don Fucking Revie"" again -- beat it so the only name anyone sings in their Yorkshire ale houses, raising their stinking jars to their stinking mouths, is Brian Clough. Brian Clough uber fucking alles. Understand?"
radio announcer,"..Ladies and Gentlemen, the draw for the third round of the FA Cup will now commence.."
clough,"C'mon, Pete!"
radio announcer,"Derby County, second division.. CLOUGH Here we go. That's us..!"

uncle sam,I can hear the cash registers now!
clough,"Happy days, Sir. Happy days. UNCLE SAM You're not wrong, Brian. Take the family out for a meal. Go to The Mumtaz. Tell `em I'm paying."
clough,Put the fish and chips in the bin. Tonight's on Uncle Sam. We're going posh. Chicken fucking bhuna in town. General excitement. Everyone starts putting on their coats.
clough,"Right, you two, I want Billy Bremner and Johnny Giles to be able to read THAT...  And this woodwork has seen better days.."
13,16   CON TINUE D:                                                   16
clough,"Spick and span, understand? Wash these walls down. Give the floors a proper polish."
clough,I want it perfect. Like a fucking carpet. We've got proper footballers coming. Who know how to keep the ball on the deck.
groundsman,"Well, you can't fucking train on it then."
clough,You know he'll be making a file on us. A dossier.
taylor,Who?
clough,Don Revie. Prepares a file on every game. Leaves nothing to chance. Knows every opponents formations. Strategies. Everything.
taylor,"I've heard he's a superstitious twat.  Ey..! Help him, someone HELP him..!"
clough,"We grew up just a few streets apart, you know. In Middlesborough, close to Ayrsome Park. He'll have known my street, Valley Road - probably bought sweets from Garnetts Factory, where my dad worked."
taylor,"Heard he wears the same suit to every game. His ""lucky blue suit"". "

clough,"The best manager in the country, Don Revie. Played for Sunderland, like me, as a centre-forward, like me, and England, like me."
taylor," C'mon, give it and go!"
clough,"Peas in a pod, me and Don. Two peas in a fucking pod."
jimmy,"They're here!  Well, almost.."
clough,What are they doing?
jimmy,They've run out of petrol.
taylor,"No, it's that superstition, isn't it? Every away cup ties, Revie makes them walk the last hundred yards. TAYLOR mutters under his breath, ""Soppy twat""."
clough,"Welcome to Derby, Don. Pleasure to meet you. I'm Brian Clough."

clough,Didn't say good-bye. Or pay me the respect of staying for a drink. Couldn't wait to get away.
taylor,Bloody cheats and all. Neither of those goals should have been allowed.
clough,"Just going to have to beat them, Pete. Beat him it's the last thing I do."
taylor,We need to get into the same division first.
17,25   CON TINUE D:                                                   25
clough,We need someone with a good head. Experience.
taylor,I know. Our lot were like headless chickens out there today.
clough,"First thing Monday morning, I want you to go and find me that player. A wise head."
clough,Right. Better go and make myself known. CLOUGH removes his jacket. JIMMY GORDON and CLOUGH's SONS watch as he walks out onto the training pitch...
clough," All right, gentlemen, gather around, please."

You've done it all by bloody cheating."
giles,I don't know what you're talking about.
clough,"But you do, though, ""Bites yer Legs""."

clough,"Not with me as manager. Do that on my watch, you'll be fined and stuck in the reserves.  Now let's start off by playing some seven-a-sides. PLAYERS stare at one another. Bristling. Disbelieving looks."
bremner,Don never did that.
clough,"Well, I'm not Don. And from now on I never want to hear that man's name again. Ever. Next player who mentions it, or what he did or didn't bloody do in the good ol' days, will spend a week cleaning my boots.  Seven-a-side. Keep it nice and clean, and sensible. No fifty-fifty's. CLOUGH sees that one side is a man short.."

jimmy,In the boot of the car.
clough,Good lad.
clough,Stand back.
cussins,Everything all right?
clough," Fine thank you, Mr. Cussins."
barbara,"Not now, love - please?"
clough,But it might be Pete.
barbara, Of course it's Pete.
clough,"But it might be important.  C'mon, eat your carrots. For your Mother."
taylor,You asked me to find a player with a good head. Experience.  I've found one! He's perfect. Dave Mackay.
clough,Dave Mackay?!? He's a hundred and fucking fifty.
taylor,I admit he's not young.
clough,Not young? He's old as fucking time!
taylor,"But he's clever, keeps the ball well. And passes it better than anyone alive. "
23,33   CON TINUE D:                                                33
taylor," He's the one, Brian."
clough,You sure?
taylor,Never been more sure of anything in my life.
clough,"All right, I'll talk to Longson in the morning. TAYLOR We haven't got until morning. Hearts have already made him an offer. Want him as their manager. Apparently they've already agreed terms."
clough,"Well, what did you fucking call me for then?"
taylor,Because when I asked Bill Nick how done the deal was - he said ninety- nine per cent. CLOUGH's face.
clough,Meaning he hasn't signed.
taylor,Exactly.
barbara,"All right, Brian. Enough. Come back now.."
24,34   CON TINUE D:                                                    34
barbara,Brian..? Love..?
clough,Where would we play him?
taylor,"In the middle of the park. Somewhere he can see everything, use his loaf, and tell the kids what to do."
clough,"We'll play him as a sweeper, then."
taylor, Aye.
clough,Won't have to run about too much. And what's all this I hear about a tie shop?
taylor,"He's got a tie shop, hasn't he? In London. Which he spends two days a week at."
clough,Fucking tie shop?
24a,37   CON TINUE D:                                                  37

clough,No one's going to be wearing fucking ties in twenty years time.
clough,You know it's illegal. To sign someone on the sabbath.
taylor,Is it?  Then perhaps we should just shake on it today? And sign tomorrow?
clough,What? And let Hearts in again in the morning? Fuck off.  I'm not leaving here without a signature. CLOUGH and TAYLOR walk up the garden path..
taylor,"Hey, you would never have FOUND him if it weren't for me."
clough,Good job we're both wearing ties.

mackay,Who the bloody hell are you?
clough,"My name's Brian Clough, and I once had the pleasure of playing for England against you in an Under-23 match."
mackay,"I remember you now. You had a black eye, a right bloody shiner.  And never stopped fucking talking! What are you doing here?"
clough,"Come to talk to you about the Promised Land, Dave. Land of Milk and Honey. It's a little place up the M1 called Derby.  May we come in?"
uncle sam,Dave Mackay??
clough,"You don't look happy, Uncle Sam."
uncle sam,I'm not. What were you thinking? Going over my head like that? Why didn't you call?
clough,Because you'd have said `no'.

clough,Pete reckons he's good for three more years.
uncle sam,Is he fuck. He's broken more bones than Evel Knievel.
clough,"Trust me, Mr. Chairman. It's money well spent."
uncle sam,And who the FUCK are they? CLOUGH That'd be Messrs. McGovern and O'Hare.
uncle sam, Where did they come from?
clough,"My old stomping grounds. Hartlepools and Sunderland. Very reasonable, too."
uncle sam,"That'd be MY club, Brian. MY club."

clough,"You're a genius, Pete. Bloody genius. How did you see it?"
taylor,"Dunno. It was just obvious. McGovern in midfield, Mackay at the back, O'Hare up front. The skewer isn't it? In the shish kebab."
clough,"It's beautiful. A thing of fucking beauty!! CLOUGH grabs TAYLOR's head, kisses him. OVER THIS: we fade in the roar from the crowd..."

journalist,"Will you be supporting Leeds today, Don?"
revie,You'd expect nothing less having been their manager for 13 years. But the fact is I'm here today as manager of England...
journalist,"Do you have any advice to give your successor, Brian Clough, before his first game? A mischievous smile barely perceptible of REVIE's face.."
revie,Win. The people of Leeds are used to winning.

clough,For fuck's sake.. COMMENTATOR  ...the referee is talking to his linesman..! He's sending them off! The referee is sending off both players..
clough," Because losing wasn't enough, was it? You only had to be the first Englishman to be sent off at Wembley."
bremner, Not fucking English.
clough,There I am making a big song and dance to the media about our new approach. Our new attitude. Our new ethics. And you turn the place into fucking Verdun. My CAPTAIN.
bremner,You can't do that! Mr. Revie always paid all our fines.
clough,"Well he's not fucking here now, is he?"
bremner,"No, he's not."
clough,"Right, last time there was a whole division between you and Leeds. Not now. Not today. Today we're here as Second Division champions, and equals with Leeds. John McGovern and Billy Bremner, EQUALS. Kevin Hector and Johnny Giles, EQUALS. Alan Hinton and Peter Lorimer, John O'Hare and Paul Madely. EQUALS. Now, c'mon, chins up. Chests out. We can take this fucking lot."
taylor,Arrogant twat..

taylor,Yours.
clough,"He was all over the place. Like the Wandering Jew. Giving the ball to anyone BUT his own. We need a ball player, a natural in midfield. Who'll hold onto it. Keep possession. We're giving it away too easily."
taylor,"Someone like Colin Todd. CLOUGH  Oooh, now you're talking. Lovely pair of feet."
taylor,"I've heard he wants out of Sunderland, too. They're all jumping ship up there."
clough,"Well, go on then. Sign him. TAYLOR What? We can't. Longson's already told us. Club's in debt."
clough,"Bollocks to that. I've not brought us all the way to the First Division just to sit there mid-table, and be cannon fodder for sides like Leeds. Sign the man."
taylor,"Hang on, hang on, careful..."
clough,I'll handle bloody Longson.
uncle sam,A hundred and seventy grand?!? For Colin fucking Todd?!?
clough,"Correction, the ALMIGHTY Colin Todd. The best technical footballer in the country."
uncle sam,A salary of three hundred quid a week? You can't pay a footballer that!!
clough,"That's the way things are going, Uncle Sam. Football's all about money now."
uncle sam,I told you never to go over my head again.
clough,Had no choice. Windows opened up. You were in the bloody West Indies.
uncle sam,WindowS? You mean there were others?!?
clough,Messrs. Gemmell and Hennessy.
uncle sam, For fucks SAKE!
clough,"Let me ask you a question, Uncle Sam. What did you come into football for?"
uncle sam,To support the football club in MY HOME TOWN. The club I've supported ALL MY LIFE.

clough,"Well, I'm sure we all admire your loyalty..."
uncle sam,What I DIDN'T come into it for was to be lectured by a cocky little twat from the North East.
clough,"But the way I see it, there's no point being in this game unless you want to beat the best, and be the best, and that's all the people of Derby want. To see their team on top of the tree, Derby, Derby Uber Alles, and if it's really their interest you have at heart, not just impressing your friends in the Director's box, I suggest you keep your eyes on your road haulage business, keep your opinions to yourself and start signing some fucking cheques, there's a good lad. Leave the running of this football club to the professionals."
uncle sam,"But professionals DON'T run the club, Brian, the Chairman does. And if it's true, that football is all about money, and that's the way it's going, that's suits us Chairmen just fucking fine..because we're the ones who've got it. SAM LONGSON lights a cigar, and walks off."

mcgovern,"No, Boss."
clough,"Then why the fuck did you give it to their most dangerous player, Johnny fucking Giles?"
mcgovern,I didn't see him.
clough,"You want me to get the sack, Mr O'Hare?"

When Derby County were at the fucking foot of the Second Division, when nobody had heard of them for twenty years and nobody had heard of Sam bloody Longson ever. Full stop. And that's where you'd still fucking be if it wasn't for me; at the foot of the bloody Second Division, where nobody remembered you and nobody had heard of you.

taylor,"Well, let's see, shall we?"
cussins,"Let's be honest. It's not working, is it?"
clough,"What's not working? I haven't been here five minutes, so how can anything be working yet?"
cussins,Still...the players aren't happy. We're not happy.
clough,"So what do you want to do about it? CUSSINS If it's not working, then we'll have to part company."
clough,Fine. It'll cost you twenty-five grand.
cussins,What? For six weeks work?
clough,Plus three and a half grand for Jimmy Gordon. And an agreement that Leeds United will pay both our income taxes for the next three years.
cussins,That's bloody criminal.
clough,"No, what's criminal, Mr. Cussins, is the way you as Chairman asked me to leave the room like that in front of the players. Your MANAGER. Going behind my back like that."
cussins,"I admit, that was wrong."

clough,"Might be a bit flash for a man out of a job, but the truth is, I've grown to like it."
cussins,Who the bloody hell do you think you are?
clough,Brian Clough. Brian Howard Clough.
cussins,Aye. No danger of me forgetting THAT name in a hurry.
mackenzie,"Just wanted to say, it's not right. They should have given you more time. CLOUGH Good lad."
mackenzie,"Not just me that feels that way, either."
clough,"The sad thing is, it won't work. You can't change a manager like a pair of socks. It'll happen once, to me - and never again."
clough,No problem.

floor manager,"Five, four, three.. The PRESENTER looks up.."
mitchell,"Good evening. Tonight the football world was stunned by the news that Brian Clough has been sacked as manager of Leeds United. We'll be talking not just to Brian Clough, but also to the man he replaced, who's success he couldn't emulate, Don Revie."
clough,"Obviously, Austin, my initial reaction is one of shock at finding myself here with Revie..."
revie,See? Not so easy to make accusations when it's to someone's face...
clough,"...but in answer to your question, six weeks is hardly a long time to be given a chance in any job. I would hope Revie would get a lot longer time in his."

mitchell,"Do you consider it was possible to step into your shoes, Don Revie? To replace you?"
revie,"Being very, very honest, I think it was a difficult job for anyone to do. But I do feel Brian Clough, I won't call him Clough because I won't take him down like that.."
clough,Thank you.

revie,...I do feel he made it harder for himself than he need have.
clough,"How did I do that, Don?"
revie,Shooting his mouth off about how dirty my players were.
clough,"Well, you WERE dirty, Don!"
revie,"That's not true. The last four seasons, we've topped the charts for entertaining football."
clough,"And before that, you also topped ALL the disciplinary charts. You should have been docked points and sent DOWN to the second Division."
mitchell,"And in fact, you went on record and said so, Brian Clough. Again and again. That Leeds should, in fact, be relegated."
clough,And I was right.
mitchell,Do you think that might have hurt your chances of success when you then came to manage them?
revie,"Of course it did! The things he said? Why, man? Why did you take the job in the first place?"
clough,Because I thought it was the best job in the country.
revie,Of course it was the best job in the country.
clough,I was taking over the League Champions.

clough,"And I fancied winning the league, and winning Europe, and doing it better than you."
revie,There's no way you COULD win it better.
clough,But that's the only hope I've got.
revie,I only lost four matches..
clough,"Well, I can only lose three."
revie,"No, no, no, no. CLOUGH And still play attractive, clean football. Without cheating!"
revie,"See, there he goes again.."
mitchell,"Listening to you, I am struck that this is not just a business matter for you both. It's more than that. It's personal. Am I right?"
clough,"Well, we're very different people, Don and I. We have different styles. In football and in life. I'm a warm man. An idealist. I do believe in faeries, and that is my outlook. Don is different. There's a hardness to him. A hardness. Maybe he's not even aware of it. But he's a cold person."
revie,You don't KNOW me!

clough,And that lack of warmth. That coldness was there. Permeated the club when I arrived.
revie,I totally refute that. The atmosphere at Leeds was like a family. A happy family. You ask any of my players. I signed most of them personally. Knew their backgrounds. Their parents. Their streets. I was a father to them. In that club every morning. Massaging those boys. Did you do that for them?
clough,They would never have let me.
revie,"Did you try? You didn't even try. I soaped those boys down with my own hands. You just went to Leeds with no thought for the club, no thought for the players. Just on some kind of mad personal vendetta with me."
clough,Well are you surprised? What else was I going to do?? After what you did...
revie,What did I do?
clough,"C'mon, Don. You know exactly. "

revie,Never! Matter of principle! I always shake the other manager's hand!
clough,"You shook Peter Taylor's hand, and my trainer, Jimmy Gordon's."
revie,Then I probably didn't see you!!
clough,"No, you saw me Don. But considered me beneath you. Looked down on me. And dismissed me. Just like you did every other club and every other manager in the country."

clough," Well, you certainly know it NOW."
revie,"Oh, we ALL know it now.  We know you as the man who's constant outbursts, his defaming of fellow professionals, have brought this game, this beautiful game into disrepute. Who had one of the best jobs in the country, at Derby, and managed to get the sack. Who had one of the best partners in the game, in Peter Taylor, and threw him away. Who was given the greatest gift in British football Leeds United, a team that in ten years hasn't finished outside the top four, and took them to the bottom of the first division. Yes, it's fair to say we all know who you are now."
mitchell,"OK, gentlemen, we're going to have to leave it there.."
clough,"Well, let's see where we are in a year's time, Donald Revie. REVIE Dear oh dear.."
