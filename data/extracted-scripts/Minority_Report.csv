Speaker,Dialogue
female," JOHNNY, PLEASE"
male right," ""Johnny, please.  Johnny please."""
female,You're scaring me.
male left," DADDY, DON'T. DADDY"
male right," I don't like you any more, Carol."
female, Put the scissors down.  You're scaring me.  Please.
male right,"Oh, Carol."
female,Johnny!  Stop!
male right,Don't grab at me!  Let
male left,Daddy!  No!
all three,Murderer!
johnny, Why'd you let me sleep so long?
carol,"It's Saturday, Johnny, you always --  Why are you staring at me like that?"
johnny,I'm unhappy that you let me sleep so long.
johnny,I didn't do anything!
officer 1,Come out of the closet on your hands and knees.
officer 1,Hands and knees!
johnny,I didn't...
officer 2,POSITIVE FOR JOHN PALMER.
officer 1," But you are under arrest for the future murderer of your wife, Carol Palmer.  You have no rights."
witwer,Thought we might a had a runner.
anderson,"Yeah, a runner."
witwer,A little chase -- that'd been good.
anderson,Fifty cops on the scene takes the chase out of them.
witwer, But only eight of us were real.
anderson,"We ever get a runner, I'd be too old to give chase."
witwer,"You'd chase.  You'd love it,.  Man."
anderson,I love it more Johnny boy doesn't get to murder his wife.
witwer, It's a beautiful world.
lisa,"Jesus, Paul.  Your heart's hammering.  I excite you that much?"
anderson,I used to love being a cop.
lisa,You're still a cop.  I'm a factory worker.  We don't catch murderers. We process them.
lisa,You're the best homicide cop in the country.
anderson,Great -- except there's no such thing as homicide.  What I do best doesn't exist anymore.
lisa,PAUL.  You're the Director of a perfect system.  A Cop with a perfect record
anderson,The Precogs have a perfect record. They identify the accused -- I just put on my monkey suit and go round them up.
lisa,And then I prosecute them.  And they go to jail.  And lives are saved. Thousands of lives.  And that's a cop's dream.
anderson,No.  You're a cop's dream.
anderson,Who called?
lisa,No one.  I called about my hair. Getting it done this afternoon.
anderson,"Come on in, neighbor.  Want some coffee?"
lisa,"Oh, Frank.  That's so sweet.  Thank you."
anderson,Before all this genetically engineered crap ...
anderson,Coffee?
lisa,You and Ellie come for supper then.
anderson,We'll barbecue.
intercom voice,"Yes, Director Anderson?"
anderson,Where's Ennis Page?  Why hasn't he delivered this morning's Precog discs?
intercom voice,"I'll find him, sir."
witwer,"Bullying the staff again, Director Anderson?"
anderson,Screw you.
witwer,The Johnny Palmer bust?
anderson,Yeah.
witwer,It was okay.  We got our man.
anderson,When do we not get our man?
page,"Sorry I'm late, sir.  Precogs put out a heavy national volume this morning -- four for our zone."
witwer,Now that's a guy who really cares.
tour guide,Welcome to the main headquarters of Precrime.  Smaller Precrime branches are scattered throughout the United States.
tour guide,That's exactly right!  A lot of people assume there are Precogs in every branch office. 
timmy,They protect us.
tour guide," That's right, Timmy.  Because of the Precogs, you're going to grow up murderfree.  Isn't that something?"
tour guide,"Never, sir.  It's an infallible system.  The Precogs predict a homicide, and our Precrime police then apprehend that future murderer before the event occurs.  And right next door is the Judicial Center, where we prosecute the future murderers."
timmy,Can we see the Precogs?
tour guide,"No, I'm sorry.  That part of the building is not open to the public.  Now, if you'll just step this way ..."
anderson,What would they think about if we unhooked them?
page,"They don't think, sir.  They just see."
lisa,"Director Anderson, do you swear that the disc you now present to the court is the only and authentic disc of the future murder of Carol Palmer by her husband, John Palmer?"
anderson,Yes.  This is the only and authentic disc of the event seen by the Precognitive mutants and recorded by the Precrime Division.  This is the immutable evidence of the infallible system.
lisa,The murder of Carol Palmer will occur ... ?
anderson,"In one week -- June 16th, 2040 at 10:33 in the morning."
carol,"Johnny, please --"
johnny,"""Johnny, please.  Johnny please."""
carol,You're scaring me.
johnny's son,"DADDY, DON'T.  DADDY"
johnny," I don't like you any more, Carol."
carol, Put the scissors down.  You're scaring me. Please.
johnny,I didn't do it.  I'm innocent!  It didn't happen!
judge,How does the defense plead?
defense attorney,The defense acknowledges the infallibility of the system.  We are Guilty.  We throw ourselves at the mercy of the court.
johnny,No! No! The Precogs are wrong!  No!
witwer, Looks like the old days.
anderson,That would be bad news for an infallible system.
witwer,We know it can't be a murder -- the Precogs would've seen it.  Why do you insist on coming to these things?
anderson,"Keeps the system honest.  And besides, I like to pretend I'm a cop."
officer,"Right here, sir."
anderson,Hi DOC.
holographic doctor,"Hello, Director Anderson."
witwer,"This a homicide, Doc?"
holographic doctor,"I'm presently analyzing neurohormones, Assistant Director Witwer.  I have not concluded my examination."
witwer,Bingo.  The guy put the gun to his own head.
holographic doctor,"I have not determined that yet, Assistant Director."
witwer,"You have good ears for a ghost, Doc."
holographic doctor,Please rotate the corpse to the lateral supine position.
witwer,Can you imagine if this was a homicide?  Who even knows how to hunt down a killer any more?
anderson,"I know how, dammit.  You know how."
witwer,"Easy, partner.  But you know what I'm saying.  The state legislatures are pushing to stop funding for training homicide detectives ..."
anderson,God bless the Precogs.
holographic doctor,"This event is a negative homicide. A mortal wound was generated by a .22 calibre bullet self-delivered to the parietal 'portion of the skull on June 10th, 2040, at 11:57 pm, "
witwer,"It's time to stop coming to these, partner."
anderson,Yeah.  You're right.
anderson,A little bit of me dies every time I come to one of these things.
lisa,"It's only a party, Paul."
anderson,I'd never have let them appoint me to Precrime if I'd have known this was going to be part of it.
lisa,You're exactly what Precrime needed. An amazing homicide cop and a real person in an unreal job.
lisa,"The public loves the Precogs.  But they give people the creeps, too.  You're something they understandp a regular cop running things."
anderson,Let's invite all these irregular assholes over for a barbecue.  Burgers and beer - think they'd come?
senator malcolm,"I'd come, Mr. Director.  And I'd make all the other assholes come with me."
senator malcolm,"I have a dream, Paul."
anderson,"I know you do, Senator."
senator malcolm,"Hundreds of Precogs.  Not just predicting murders, but predicting all crimes.  Burglary, arson, assaults ..."
anderson,How about jaywalking?  Littering? Now there's a crime.
senator malcolm,"I don't want a police state, you know that.  But we have an opportunity here, and"
anderson,"No sir, we don't have that opportunity.  There are only three Precogs.  They're a lucky accident of nature.  There are no more."
senator malcolm, We can make more.  Just give me your support.  Help me increase funding for the Precog Engineering Project.
anderson,"Precogs aren't sheep or pigs.  Seeing into the future is a gift, a nonreproducible event. "
senator malcolm,Fuck Mozart.  The people want to be safe.  They want that more than they want food or love.
anderson,"Senator, a world filled with hundreds of Precogs is not my idea of a safe place."
senator malcolm,"Sure could use your help, Paul."
anderson,"I decline, Senator.  I'm sorry."
senator malcolm, Don't think I'll come to your barbecue after all.
anderson,Not my sort of place.
anderson,"When it comes to needles and scalpels, yeah."
anderson,What do you use them on?
anderson,What's happening here?
anderson,What's in the cylinders?
anderson,From ...?
anderson,A fusion of ... ?
anderson,"It's great out here, Frank.. You got the touch."
anderson,"Sure, Frank.  Yeah.  INT. FRANK'S KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER"
anderson,"He'd served his time, Frank.  I know it's not fair.  It's way beyond not fair ..."
anderson,"Next Wednesday, at noon."
anderson,"It's not in you, Frank, to kill anybody."
anderson,"I know, Frank."
anderson,No.
anderson, You blame him?  The guy killed his daughter!
witwer,Precrime did the job it was supposed to do.
witwer,It's not easy.  It beats us down. Ellie in there -- no doubt she hates you right now.
anderson,That's why I got into this business -- to be hated.
witwer,"They hated us when we were regular cops.  Now we're Precrime, and they still hate US.  It's one of the little perks of law enforcement nobody knows about."
anderson,"Oh, Ed ..."
all three,Murderer!
angela,Sir?
anderson,Come in.  Angela.
angela,Need you to sign these.  And your eleven o'clock starts in five minutes.
anderson,My ... eleven.
angela," You okay, sir?"
anderson,Have Page take this.
angela,"But sir, the procedure"
angela,Yes sir.
anderson,"I'll speak to Witwer, put him in charge for the rest of the day."
witwer,"Breaking and entering.  That'll get you five to ten, hard."
anderson,Take over for me today?
witwer,You sick?
anderson,Yeah.
witwer,Don't give it to me.  You probably have that Trans-10 virus going around. A stomach thing.  I hate stomach things.
anderson,Ed.
witwer,Yeah?
anderson,"Run the place, okay?"
witwer, Go on home before I call Infectious Control and have them spray you down with something.
anderson,Can't let them back up.  Do 'em.
witwer,"Call you later.  Take it easy, all right?"
lisa,Paul?
anderson,Listen to me.
lisa,I can hardly hear you.
anderson,I'm underground.  Weakens the signal so it can't be picked up.
lisa,But we're on Secure
anderson,"Listen, dammit!  I'm going to murder Ed."
lisa,Paul.  Paul His crackling voice faintly comes through the phone.
anderson's voice,... home.
police officer,"Hello, sir."
anderson,"What's your name, officer?"
police officer,"Bob, uh, Robert Smythe."
anderson,These the new Python transports?
anderson,Don't move.
lisa,It's a hundred degrees in here.
anderson,"I turned the furnace all the way up. Your hair dryer.  The oven.  If they come, it'll buy me twenty seconds. Maybe thirty."
lisa,Nobody's coming for you.
anderson,I'm going to kill Ed Witwer.
lisa,It's not true.
anderson,"One week from today.  Tuesday, June 25, at five-twenty in the morning. I shoot him, Lisa."
lisa, You need to take time off.
anderson,You don't have to worry about that.
lisa, I want to hold you.
anderson,"If you love me, stand there.  And don't move."
lisa,Something's wrong.  You wouldn't do it.
anderson,"The Precogs are never wrong.  They emit a single disc.  ""The immutable evidence of the infallible system."""
lisa,We'll figure this out.  We'll review the system.
anderson,There is no review.  There's only the disc.  It Shows My guilt.  There's no defense.
lisa,"You can't run.  Please, let's --"
anderson,Last week.  It was strange.  I watched from the bathroom window.  You went out in the backyard to make a call.
lisa,"Stop it!  Paul, please.  You're panicking.  Everything's going to look wrong.  You're going to distrust everybody and everything now."
anderson,Ed.  why outside?  Why lie about it?
lisa,Stop being a cop and listen to me!
lisa,Your birthday's tomorrow!  We wanted to...
lisa,Paul!
officer 1,He's got a hair dryer going.  Screwed up my reading.
officer 2,We're not picking up shit.
voice,Paul Anderson 0256 clear.
voice,"Enter now please, Assistant Director Witwer."
cia cronin,The central question is: Why does Anderson want to kill Witwer?
fbi swanson,"Personnel checks reveal no ambitious coups planned by you to topple him.  He's done nothing to you, or you to him."
witwer,No.
fbi swanson,HIS MOTHER?  HIS BROTHER?
justice pollard,"So, you are friends, partners, and soul mates.  Anderson has no motive."
witwer,I can't think of one.  Maybe JUSTICE POLLARD The Precogs are mistaken?
justice pollard,"You don't believe that, do you?"
witwer, No.  The Precogs are infallible.
senator malcolm,"You're goddam right.  So, gentlemen -screw the motive.  We got a pre-murderer on the run, and a nasty little PR problem."
witwer,Now look--
cia cronin,The public must believe that every future murderer is pursued with equal vigor.
fbi swanson,"Therefore, Precrime will put in charge the man best suited to the job.  And who would pursue a murderer harder ... than his intended victim?"
justice pollard,"You went after Anderson yesterday -because it was right, and because you believe."
justice pollard,"Haw long will it take, Director?"
witwer,"He knows Precrime, of course.  And the streets -- he's rusty, but he'll remember how to work them.  It'll come back to him fast.  He's ... the best."
justice pollard,We're not here to praise Caesar -- we're here to bury him.
witwer,"He can't avoid iris identification. Every door he opens, every ATM he uses, or taxi or transport he boards -- he'll get scanned.  It won't take long to find him."
technician,It's Anderson.
witwer,Paul!
technician 2,He's been Scanned.  He's on the 33rd Street Subway!
technician,"His cell phone tracks for The Sprawl. We got him on the Subway, too!"
anderson,"Why am I going to kill you,Ed?"
witwer,There's no motive
anderson,My wife calling you before breakfast?
witwer,"We were planning a surprise party. It was going to be today.  Happy birthday, partner."
anderson,"This party's no fun, Ed. It's a hell of a surprise, though.  I'm having trouble trusting people, Ed, I gotta tell you."
officer,"The train makes two stops, here and here: 20th, then 33rd Street."
witwer," Split the units, go to both"
officer,We'll never make 20th
anderson,"You there, Ed?"
witwer,"I'm here.  You gotta come in, Paul ."
anderson,"I'm a Cop, Ed. I need a motive."
witwer,Come in.  We'll figure this thing out together.
witwer,"It'll get ugly if you keep running. And your eyes, Paul -- every move you make a Scanner will pinpoint you for us."
anderson,I saw a news flash.  You're the new Director.  Is that the point of this?
witwer,Fuck you.
anderson,"Didn't think so.  But it has to be something, Ed."
witwer,Paul.  Come in.
anderson,"If I come in, it puts me close to you.  If I get close ... I may kill you.  I can't risk that.  Anyway, they'd force you to lock me up.  And that'd be it -- I'd never get my chance to solve this thing."
witwer,"You're kinds liking this, in a way, aren't you?  The action ..."
anderson,And you get to be a real cop again. We get to flex our muscles.
technician 2,We have visual verification -- he's still on the train.
anderson's voice,"I want to tell you something, partner. You listening?"
witwer,Yeah.
anderson's voice,"I gotta do this.  I have to figure this thing out.  But listen to me now.  If it was you running, I'd come after you, Ed."
witwer,"You wouldn't shoot a cop would you, Paul?  Paul?  Paul?"
technician 1,He's still on the line.
doc,Got a cold.
anderson,"I'm not here for cat surgery, Doc."
doc,Yeah.  All right.
andersoin,"I'm a cop, I know"
doc,I gotta take your eyes out.
anderson,"Yeah.  I get it, DOC."
doc's voice,Don't take the bandages off for twenty four hours.  You'll go blind if you do.
doc,"You're in a room.  I had you moved here, a couple miles from my place. If they find you, they don't find me."
anderson, Nano-re ...construction.
doc,Organic microrobots that reconstruct nerves and blood vessels.  It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  Don't scratch.
anderson,Jesus.
doc,"You tighten up again in about thirty minutes.  Hurts like nothing you ever felt.  It's vicious, but effective.  I'll put it in your bag."
anderson,"I'm hungry, but sick to my stomach. "
anderson, Fuck.
officer 1,"Got 27 warm bodies in this place. What should it take, three or four Spiders?"
officer 2,"Do four.  Speed things up, so we can go eat."
old woman,It's nice to have a little company
officer 1,Stinking drunk.
officer 2, Or a guy who doesn't want to get read.
officer 1,Let's eat.
witwer,They told me to move into Paul's office.  I said fuck you very much.
lisa,I know.  I know that. 
witwer,"Yeah.  But if he shoots a cop ...  Which is what he does four days from now, isn't it?"
lisa,He'd never hurt you.
witwer,I know that.  But the other thing I know is -- the Precogs are never wrong.
driver,"Welcome aboard, Mr. Symington.  Plenty of seats in the back."
anderson,"Time to upgrade your alarm system, Senator."
senator malcolm,There's no motive.
anderson,"There's, always a motive."
senator malcolm,What the fuck was I worried about? You can't kill me.  The Precogs would've seen it.
anderson,"Tell you something about the Precogs, Senator.  They're great on murder. But it's the little things they fail to see."
witwer,He hasn't shown up on one goddamn IdentiScan in three days.
lieutenant glaser,He's found a room -- he's going to sit it out.
witwer,"Yeah, except for holding a gun to senator Malcolm's goddman head in his own goddman house last night, Anderson's sitting it out!  Why hasn't he been scanned?"
lieutenant glaser,Hes beating the scanners
witwer,No one beats the scanners.
lieutenant glaser,But the scarring always
witwer,He went the whole way.  The crazy bastard had his eyes removed.  New ones sewn in.
lieutenant glaser,That takes weeks to heal.
witwer,"If you're prepared to go blind, a street surgeon'll juice up the repair cycle.  They don't give a fuck about risk."
spokeswoman,"The United States Supreme Court has issued a special injunction allowing the unprecedented public viewing of former Precrime Director Paul Anderson's future murder of Edward Witwer, the current Director."
anderson,"His mouth slowly opens.  He steps back against a wall and slides his hand into his pants pocket.  He looks at the Precog DISC in his cupped hand, then quickly puts it away."
spokeswoman,She continues her declamation
anderson,Shakes his head in confusion and disbelief.  But he has the Precog disc ...
old guy,"This oughtta be good, huh?"
video,KIOSK
anderson,"Oh, Ed ..."
anderson,"""Ennis Page engages the services of prostitutes because his relationships with them compound his feelings of selfloathing.""  Direct quote from your psychological profile -- the kind of shit I had to know as your former boss."
page,"I fuck whores and I'm orderly, so what?"
anderson,"Something's out of order, Ennis. Deeply out of order."
page, You can't make copies
anderson,Ennis -- you gave out the same disc twice.  Less than an hour apart. The one I stole.  And then another one.  Of the same event.
page,It's impossible.  The Precogs can only move forward to new events. Into the future.  They never repeat.
digital voice,"Have a nice night, Mr. Symington"
young guy,"Hey!  Hey, you can't..."
anderson,It's me.
lisa,Paul.
anderson,"Your phone will be bugged.  So we can't meet, we can't do anything. Just listen.  Nowing you're listening is enough."
lisa,No.
anderson,I know.  Witwer sent them.  He saw the disc and had to do his job.  Tell me you forgive me.  Please.
lisa,"Of course, I forgive you."
anderson,All these people I need to forgive me.  I love you.
lisa, Frank hated gardenias.
voice,Paul Anderson.  Drop to your hands and knees!
driver,What the hell --
voice,Paul Anderson.  Drop to your hands and knees!
anderson,Pick one for me!
kid,What?
anderson,Point to the train I should take. Please.
kid,I don't know.
officer,Don't kill me!  Jesus.  Please.
anderson,But the Precogs would've predicted me killing you.  You'd know whether I do or not.
officer,They're off homicides.  They're redirecting them to help us locate you.
attendant,You all right in there?
tour guide,Welcome to the main headquarters of Precrime.  Smaller Precrime branches are scattered throughout the United States.
witwer,What is it?
technician,Must be a glitch ...
witwer,What?
technician,Anderson just got IdentiScanned.
witwer,Where is he?
technician,But he's had his eyes done.  Right? Sir?  Tries to think it through.
witwer, He had to have.
technician,"Jesus Christ, sir.  He's in the basement of this building."
witwer,This is ridiculous.
lieutenant glaser,"Standing orders from the Security Panel, sir."
witwer,"If he wants to get to me, he'll get to me."
lieutenant glaser,"No, he won't, sir."
technician,"Don't worry, air -emergency generators will kick on in five seconds."
witwer,"Explanation, please!"
technician,"Uh, sir.  It seems ... he got the generators, too."
voice,Shit.
female,"Save us, Anderson."
anderson,I have to get out of here.
female,Save us.
anderson,"You let me get here, didn't you? You stopped giving them information, so they couldn't track me."
female,"Save -- And what can Anderson do but catch her before she falls? What can he do but throw her over his shoulder, and in the fading light of the flare, make a run for freedom."
lisa," Help me, Paul."
witwer,Why didn't the Precogs know he was coming to do this?
lieutenant glaser,"We won't let that happen, sir."
witwer,"You won't, huh?"
technician,"They're a hive mind, sir.  It takes three for their predictive abilities to be fully operational."
witwer,"These two are all I have to find the man who is about to murder me.  Hook them up, and flood them with whatever kind of fucking chemicals you have to.  They are a machine, and I need that machine at my disposal."
lisa,"Your IdentiScan is off, Ennis.  I could just walk in here."
page,I forgot.  To turn it on.
lisa,You don't look surprised to see me.
page,He took one of my babies.
lisa,"He's desperate, Ennis.  He had to.  We have to help him."
page,I delivered ... a fake .. to him?
lisa,"But he thought it was real, and ran with it."
page,He spilled coffee everywhere ... Everywhere ...
lisa,What coffee?  What are you -- ?
female,My brothers aren't here.
anderson,You didn't even look around.  You knew.
female, We can sense each other.  You must save
anderson,Stop.  I saved You.  It was the best I could do.
female,"Thank you, Anderson."
anderson,What am I going to do with you?
female,"Name me, Anderson."
anderson,What?
female,Give me a name.  I've never had one.
anderson,Listen.
female,Rose.
anderson,Rose.  They shifted your precognition so you would locate me.
rose," Yes.  And it hurt us, physically. Did you know that?  The helmets, the controls.  It hurts."
anderson, I didn't know.
rose,"We saw our chance.  You would need to shut us down, you would have to come.  We wanted you to come."
anderson,You used me -- to save you.
rose,"I have been used all my life, Anderson."
anderson,Rose.  What's going to happen to us? Can you see that?
rose,"I'm weak.  And away from my brothers. I see glimpses and hints of things nearby.  But it's all ... scattered.  I'm tired of the future, Anderson."
anderson,"You didn't know I was going to do that, did you?"
rose,"No.  Oh, Anderson.  It was lovely."
lieutenant glaser,Who else could it've been?
witwer, Page worshipped the system.  He fell apart.  Shot himself.
lieutenant glaser,Anderson.
holographic doctor,Director Witwer.  This event is a positive homicide. 
lisa,There.
lisa,"The one on the left, the first disc -it's a fake.  He doesn't have blue eyes anymore."
witwer,A fake.
lisa,"Exactly.  You can't tamper with the Precogs, induce them to make fakes "
witwer,Bypass the Precogs and slip a fake disc in with that day's real ones...
lisa, We're all programmed to believe anything we see on a Precog disc. The system has never been wrong ...
witwer," It's gone too far, Lisa She shakes her head, shocked at his response"
lisa,"He was set up!  You both were.  If Paul kills you, you're both out of the picture."
witwer,Who wants us out?  Of what picture?
lisa,"Jesus, Ed. Stop this thing!  And then we can investigate Witwer's mouth opens and closes.  He tries again."
witwer,Ennis Page was murdered last night.
lisa,He's not a murderer.
witwer,I think he is.  A murderer ... and a future murderer.  Lisa.  What does it matter that the first disc is a fake ... if the second one's real?
anderson,Rose.  Listen to me.  I'm going to leave you here.  I have to keep moving.
rose,No.  You must save my brothers.
anderson,It's impossible.  There's no time. I've done what I can do!
rose,"Come here, Anderson."
rose,"It was impossible to save that boy -- but you did, Anderson.  It's in you.  It's what you are."
anderson,You knew it wasn't impossible.  That I'd get there.
rose,You are a man who saves others.  Save my brothers.
anderson,I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
rose,My brothers are in more trouble. They've moved them to ... an awful place.
anderson,Rose.  Ed Witwer -he's in the most trouble of all.  Who saves him?
anderson,Rose.  Try to drink.
rose,"Your wife.  We have to get her here, Anderson."
anderson,Why?
rose,I don't know ...
anderson,What are you seeing?
rose,"Glimpses, Anderson.  Please.  We have to get her here."
anderson,"You're scaring me, Rose"
rose,Stop talking.  It uses me up.
secretary,"Sir?  I'm sorry, she stepped out for a few minutes.  Sir?"
lisa,Hello?  Hello?
anderson's voice,I need you.
lisa,Two hundred dollars if you don't scan me.
man,"You bite me, bitch, I'll pull your teeth out."
lisa,"Cut it a little close there, honeybunch."
anderson,Rose got the street wrong.  She's getting weak.
lisa,Rose?
anderson,Two discs.  One fake.  One real.
lisa,"I don't think there were supposed to be two.  Whoever planned it, wasn't counting on two."
anderson,An infallible system.  Every disc ever generated has been true ...
lisa,Somebody wants you out of the way -- so they make a fake disc.  Who ever doubts the discs?
anderson,"I never doubted it.  I saw it.  And believed it, absolutely.  I was certain I was going to murder Witwer."
lisa,And generated the second disc.  The real one.
anderson,A self-fulfilling prophesy.  I believed it was true.  And that made it true.
rose," We see what we see.  I'm sorry, Anderson.  It's been predicted."
lieutenant glaser,"We can't take chances, sir"
witwer,The event.
lieutenant glaser,I've been ordered to get you onto the craft.  By force if necessary.
witwer,"The event is inevitable, Lieutenant."
lieutenant glaser,"I don't leave this room without you, sir.  The Security Panel insists."
anderson,Nobody could slip a fake disc past Ennis Page Lisa shakes her head.
lisa,He was the weak link in the perfect system.
anderson,Obsessive compulsive niners can't allow changes in the routine
lisa,Something threw him off.  Someone was in his office with him. And coffee spilled ...
anderson,Rose.  What is it?
rose," We weren't just lost in the future. We were in the Chamber, too.  Our eyes were open.  In the present."
anderson,"Your eyes were open.  What did you see, Rose?"
rose,Who would I have told?  Who ever talked to us?  Who cared that we could talk?
anderson,Rose.  Who spilled the coffee? Straight ahead ...
anderson,Ed ...
lisa,The perfect system -brought down by a cup of coffee.  My god.
anderson, What makes me leave this room?  If I stay here I won't kill him.  Right?
witwer,"You see, if you think you can put me on a hovercraft and save me, then you don't believe in the infallibility of the Precog system."
witwer,Things quiet?
officer,Sir.  Should you ... be here?
witwer,There's been a development.  A body's been found in the Sprawl.
officer,Anderson's?
witwer,They're checking it out.  I need to see what the Precogs have seen.
witwer,"Borrowed this from the technicians' lounge.  You don't think they'll mind, do you?"
witwer,"No, no.  This is exactly where I should be."
witwer,And tv's so good for that -- soothes the mind.
witwer,And that's because ... ?
witwer,Do you think they know where Anderson is?
witwer,They know how to find Anderson for me. 
anderson,Jesus Christ.
lisa,"Come on, Rose."
anderson,"One hour.  We hold it together for an hour, Witwer lives -- and I'm not a murderer."
lisa,She won't last an hour.
anderson,Rose!
rose,"He's killed him, Anderson!"
anderson,"Did he kill both of them, Rose? Rose!"
rose,"Does it matter, Anderson?"
lisa,If you leave this room...
anderson,"Then I'm a cop, just trying to do hisjob."
witwer,Is he coming?  No?  Yes?  Maybe?  I think yes.
witwer,"I figured, since I can see the future, too, maybe I could get a little disc action going.  Just kidding."
anderson,"There's never anything good on, you know?"
witwer,There.  That's the old Paul.
anderson,You're not the old Ed. You've lost it.
witwer,"You lost it.  You went weak in the knees, partner."
anderson,I'm not your partner.
witwer,The air went out of you when Frank D'Ignazio killed himself.
anderson,He was guilty.  I accepted that.
witwer,No you didn't.  The doubts were creeping in on you.  The lab trying to engineer more Precogs ... Malcolm pressuring you to expand ...
anderson,Never been my style.
witwer,Precrime needs to grow.  You would have stood in its way.  The Security Panel wouldn't have understood that. What you're capable of.  What a bulldog you are.  Look what you've been doing to us all week.  Amazing.  You're the best.
anderson,So you took matters into your own hands.
witwer,I understood the threat.  I understood YOU
anderson,You killed a Precog.  You ended the system you wanted to protect.
witwer,"Wrong.  This lab will make more. Believe it, Paul."
anderson,"Knowing the exact moment of your death -it's made you crazy, Ed."
witwer,You sonofabitch!
anderson,That's right.  No gun.
witwer,You see?!  That's exactly what I'm talking about.  You don't Believe!
anderson,You can't have it both ways.  You don't want to die.  That's why you lured me here -- to kill me first. 
witwer,Pick it up
anderson,"Let's not do this, Ed Witwer trains his gun on Anderson.  Anderson trains his gun on Witwer."
witwer,Now do you believe?
rose,James.  Can you guess what I'm thinking?
james, NO.
