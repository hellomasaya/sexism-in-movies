Speaker,Dialogue
final shooting script,"NOVEMBER 30, 2015"
soldier,Captain...!
captain,"Echo two-six to command. Colonel, we have eyes on three Kong in the north woods. A couple of our donkeys think there are others here too... Maybe this is it, maybe the base is near.  Yes sir... Yes sir, copy. Over."
preacher,Reload!
agonized voice,RETREAT!!!
preacher,"Colonel - Colonel, do you copy?!"
preacher,"Preacher -- it's Preacher, sir -- !"
preacher,I don't know -- !
preacher,"I can't see anything! We lost a lot of men, sir -- the captain is dead!"
preacher,"Command, sir? I think it's just me by myself now!"
preacher,"Sir, I don't think I'm gonna make it...! I'm sorry -- I'm so sorry!"
preacher, ...it's... Alpha Omega.
lang,Means we're the beginning and end. Humanity's survival depends on us.
maurice, [Twenty-two dead. Many more injured.]
preacher,You're him... You're Caesar.
travis,Just kill us already...
lang,"Shut up, man --"
travis,"What? They're animals, he's gonna slaughter us --"
caesar,I... did not start this war.
travis, And we got ten more just like him.
caesar,I know these apes. They followed Koba...  They tried to kill me. They fear what I will do to them. They believe I cannot forgive. So now they serve you... just to survive.
red,"I no fear you! You must fear! How long you think woods can protect you? Humans destroy you. Their Kerna has all power. Humans follow all he say. To them, he more than just human. He everything."
caesar,[Get him out of here.]
luca,[What should we do with them?]
preacher,You're letting us live...?
caesar,Tell your Colonel... you have seen me now. And I have a message for him: this fighting can stop. Leave us the woods. And no more humans will die.
maurice,[Do you really think they'll give him the message?]
caesar,They are the message. I showed them mercy. He will see we are not savages.  Let's hope this works. They are getting closer...
winter,[Red attacked me!   He got away!]
caesar,"Why didn't I see, Maurice?"
maurice,[See what?]
caesar,That Koba could not forgive what humans did to him when he was their prisoner. That he would seek revenge. I should have known.
maurice,[No one could have known how much darkness was living inside of him.]
blue eyes,"[Hello, Father...]"
caesar,"Welcome home, Rocket.  You look tired."
rocket,[It was a long journey --]
blue eyes," [Father, we found something!]"
caesar,Come inside!
blue eyes,[Mother...!]
cornelia,"[Cornelius, don't you recognize your brother?]"
blue eyes," [This is it, Father. We can start over. A new home.]"
cornelia,"[What is beyond those mountains, son?]"
blue eyes,"[A desert, Rocket and I had to cross it too. The journey is long, but that is why humans will not find us.]"
winter,[We must leave tonight!]
lake,[Tonight?    That's impossible!]
winter,[How much longer can we wait?      Soldiers are getting closer!]
blue eyes, [Winter...]
winter,"[Your son's been gone, he doesn't know how hard it's been!]"
blue eyes,"[I know you are scared, we all are, but we are still planning...]"
caesar,Yes... We must still find a way to get out of the woods safely.
maurice, [The woods are filled with soldiers.]
blue eyes,Father... We must try.
caesar,"I know, son.  More apes die everyday. And we cannot hide here much longer."
blue eyes,[Can't sleep?]
caesar,"[I am so proud of you.]  [I love you, son.]"
luca,"[Sorry, Caesar.]"
caesar,[How many others on patrol?]
luca,[Five?   Six--?]
caesar,[Get them!     Rocket too!]
female soldier,"Lima-two to command. Colonel, intel's good. I'm in the target area. Are you close?"
soldier,"Lima-four to command.   Colonel, did you get him--?"
caesar,Rocket!   What happened?!
rocket,[I heard him talking!   The Colonel is here!]
the colonel,Get me out! Now!!
spear,[Luca! We can't find Winter.   He wasn't at his post.]
maurice,[He was scared. Could he have turned against us?]
luca,[Caesar... I think Winter betrayed us. I'm sorry. He was in my command.]
caesar,My youngest son...   Have you found him yet?
luca,[We're still looking.]
maurice,[Let's help them search.]
caesar,"Cornelius... you're safe now, son."
caesar,You loved my son.    Look after his brother until I return.
lake, [You're not coming with us?]
caesar,No.
maurice,[Caesar!    You're not going after them?!]
caesar,Not them... Him.
maurice,"[Caesar, you are our leader!   We can't leave without you!]"
caesar,You must.    The soldiers will be back soon.
cornelius,[Father!]
caesar," When I find him, the soldiers will all come after me. That may give you the best chance to get out of the woods. Until then, be safe."
luca,[The soldiers' camp is always moving. My guards think they know where it is. Let me take you.]
rocket,[You'll need me to back you up.]
caesar,No.
rocket,[Please... I know what it's like... to lose a son.]
caesar,I might not make it back.
maurice,[That's why I'm coming.   To make sure you do.]
luca,[This is where the guards thought they might be. There are always fires burning.]
man,I'm just gonna... put this down --
luca,[Is he out here alone?]
rocket,[Maybe he's a deserter?]
caesar,Look around. Take what we can use.
maurice,[Something wrong with her.   I don't think she can speak.]
caesar,Come.
maurice,[She'll die out here alone.]
caesar,We cannot take her.
maurice,[I understand...]  [But I cannot leave her.]
maurice,[Must be where they bury the dead.]
caesar,Looks like some were killed here.
luca,[They burned their things too.]
maurice,[Why would they kill their own men?]
luca,[Did you find the Colonel...?]
caesar,Winter...
boyle,Donkey.   Over here.
red,Ok -- Ok... He come...
boyle,Hey!   Hey!     You stupid-- !
boyle,"Shut up, Preacher -- what're you, a donkey lover now? I think you going soft coz that kong let you go."
caesar,Where is the Colonel?
winter,[He's gone.]
caesar, ...Gone?
winter,[This morning. He took many soldiers with him.]
caesar,What border? Why?
winter,[I don't know. But more of us are leaving to join them in the morning. Red thinks they'll all be coming back here... to help the Colonel finish off the apes for good.]
caesar,My son... my wife... are dead.
rocket,[Winter had it coming!]
luca,[Caesar had no choice!]
maurice,[So what do we do now?]
rocket,[Wait for the soldiers to leave.   Follow them to the Colonel.]
caesar,...Koba?
koba,Ape... not kill ape...
maurice,[The soldiers are going!]
caesar,[Is that them up ahead?]
rocket, [Looks like they stopped!]
caesar,[Don't let them see us!]
rocket, [What are they shooting at?!]
caesar,I don't know...
rocket,[They're gone...]
caesar, What is that...?
maurice, [He can not speak either...?]
caesar,Help me get him up...
maurice,[What is wrong with them...?]
maurice,[Where could they have gone?!]
caesar,Winter said they were heading to a border...!
luca,"[Yes, but which way is that?!]"
scrawny chimp, Bad... ape... Bad ape...
rocket,[Who are you?]
luca,[Where are you from?]
rocket, [I don't recognize him.   He's not one of us.]
caesar,Are you... alone here?
bad ape,Cold...?
bad ape,I see girl. Think... you human.   But you... apes. Like me!
caesar, You... live here?
bad ape," Long time. Long, long time."
caesar,Are there more like you?   More apes? From zoo?
bad ape, Dead. All dead. Long time.
caesar,You learn to speak...?
bad ape, Listen to human...
maurice,[Amazing... Always thought we were the only ones. Wonder if there are others out there somewhere? Others like us.]
bad ape,"Here! Eat, eat!  New friends. Special day."
caesar,Where did you get this?
bad ape,Bad place. Very bad. I find. Long time ago. After zoo. Looking for food. Find human zoo. Zoo for sick.
caesar,Bad humans...? Soldiers?
bad ape,Soldiers.
rocket,"[An old, deserted military camp on the border...?]"
luca,[Maybe this is where the Colonel and the troops from the north are going to meet?]
caesar,Is it far?     Can you take us?
bad ape, Human zoo?! No... No go back there. Everyone dead. I come here. Safe here. Never go back!
caesar,Please.     You must take us.
bad ape,No!     Can not take!   Can not take!
caesar, I don't know.
bad ape, But she... with you?
caesar,She has no one else.
bad ape,I see you look at her. Just now.  Look sad.
caesar,I had two.     But one was killed.   By human.
bad ape, Oh... Soldier?
caesar,I don't know... Maybe.
bad ape,Then... maybe I take you.
maurice,[Thirsty.]  [Thirsty.]
bad ape,There...
caesar,"[Luca, let's take a closer look.]  [Stay here. Keep them safe.]"
luca,[What are they doing?]
caesar, I don't know...
luca, [What's that? A patrol?]
rocket,[I saw them from up there... Coming for you...]
luca,[At least this time... I was able to protect you...]
maurice,[I know how much you have lost... But now we have lost another.]
rocket,[Luca gave his life!   We can not turn back -- !]
maurice,[Caesar...]
caesar,They must pay...
maurice,[Now you sound like Koba.]
caesar,...Koba? You know nothing.   My wife and son were killed.  You call me Koba...?!
caesar,What happened?
spear,"[They came out of nowhere, attacked us... We were sure they would kill us all -- but the Colonel stopped them!]"
caesar,Use you...?
spear,[They've been forcing us to work!]
caesar,What... kind of work...?
caesar, I came for you.
the colonel,I see... I kill somebody close to you that night...?
caesar,My... family.
the colonel,I'm sorry.     I was there to kill you.
caesar,I was told you were coming... That others would be joining you here.
the colonel, Joining me...?
caesar,To finish us off... for good.
the colonel, Who told you that?
red,"Ok -- ok, Kerna...!"
tower guard,"Evening, Colonel!"
the colonel, Any more trouble tonight?
tower guard," No, sir -- not anymore --"
the colonel,"You could use a haircut there, son.  You too, soldier."
lake,[Forgive them. We've been through much.]
caesar,I will find some way to get us out of here. I promise...
lake, [You don't know what this place is like.]
cornelius,[Father...!]
soldiers,MAKES THE GRASS GROW!!
executive officer,We...!
soldiers,MAKE THE BLOOD FLOW!!
executive officer,We are the beginning...!
soldiers,AND THE END!!
lake,[We haven't had food or water since we got here...]
caesar,[Why do they need a wall...?]
caesar,LEAVE HIM!!!
the colonel,...Ok.   Back to work.
caesar,Apes need food. Water.
the colonel,Please.    Tell them to work.
caesar, Give them food and wat--
the colonel, Tell them.
bad ape, Bad place...
rocket,[Must save them! But how?]
maurice,[Must think! What would Caesar do?]
bad ape,Oh no!
preacher,Alright -- that's good.
caesar,What did the Colonel promise you? You really think he will let you live... after we are gone?
red,Koba right. You think you know better... than rest of apes. But look you now.  You nothing.
the colonel,"Interfere with the work again, and I'll begin slaughtering the apes, one by one. Understand? I need that wall."
caesar,Apes... need food... water.
the colonel, They'll get food and water when they finish the work.
caesar,Give them food and water... or they will not be able to finish.
the colonel,You know you're very emotional.  What makes you think you're in a position to make demands?
preacher,C'mon --
caesar,"The soldiers who are coming here... are not coming to join you, are they?"
the colonel,"I was told you were smart, but... that's impressive."
caesar,They are against you?
the colonel,They... fear me.
caesar,Why...?
the colonel,Jesus Christ... you are impressive. 
caesar,I think... you have no mercy.
the colonel,You came here to kill me.   Were you going to show me mercy?
caesar,I showed you mercy... when I spared your men. I offered you peace. And you killed my family.
the colonel, Mercy. Do you have any idea what your mercy would do to us?
caesar, You killed them too...?
the colonel,"What did I do, Preacher?"
preacher," You severed their heads, sir."
the colonel,"Except for the one I spared, so he could return to deliver a message: if they wanted to relieve me of my command, they'd have to meet me here, and do it themselves."
caesar,How many... will be coming?
the colonel,Probably all of them. Don't get any ideas -- only thing they fear more than me is you apes. They never questioned my methods when it came to you.
preacher,HEY -- HEY-HEY-HEY!!!
the colonel,So emotional!
preacher,...sir --
the colonel,What do you think my men would've done to your apes... if you had killed me?
preacher,"Didn't I tell you not to agitate him? That was not smart, man..."
caesar,"If this battle is coming... you should leave, while you still can."
preacher,Leave?     What are you talking about?
caesar,You are not like him.
preacher,"He was right, you do think he's sick, don't you? You're just like them. He's not crazy. The world's gone crazy. And he's the only one with the vision to get us through this. The Colonel's a great man. He sacrificed everything for us. You can't judge him. Who are you to judge him?  I was trying to give you a heads up, keep you out of his way, I don't even know why. But if you think you and I have some kind of relationship -- that you're gonna give me, what, advice? You can disavow yourself of that notion right fucking now."
maurice, [How is he?]
lake,[You look weary.]
caesar,"[Do not lose hope... Some way, somehow, we will finish the journey to our new home. I will find a way to get us out of here.]"
preacher,Get off!
maurice,[How will we get in?   Humans everywhere.]
rocket, [Must get in somehow...]
bad ape,"""In""...?   ""In""?"
lake,[You saved our lives...]
maurice, [Sick humans must have tried to escape underground!]
bad ape,No no no -- no climb -- !
rocket,[Must be under the camp by now!]
maurice,[Wonder how close we are... to where soldiers keep apes?]
bad ape, No!
caesar,Koba...
koba, Sleep...
caesar,No...
the colonel,"If he's still alive in the morning, he goes back to work or you shoot him.  Keep him separate from the others."
bad ape,IN!     She go IN!
the girl,[Thirsty...?]
ape,[Apes together strong.]
maurice,"[If humans see her, they will kill her...]"
the colonel,How many are out there?   Are there others?
rocket,[Feeling better?]
the colonel,"For two years we've fought relentlessly against these beasts, and when we are done with them, we will bring an end to their kind. But now we find ourselves on the eve of battle... against our own kind. So you may ask: who is the real enemy, who are we fighting here? And I'll tell you. It's not the apes. It's not the men who are on their way here right now to altercate with us. The battle we've been waging all this time is against ourselves."
the colonel,Send him up to the quarry.    Alone.
preacher,"I really don't know, sir..."
the colonel,Get him to work.
tanker guard,"That's high enough, kong!"
caesar,[37 steps to the adult cage...   55 to the children.]
red,You know Kerna shoot apes tomorrow... when wall is done.
caesar,His wall is madness. It won't save him... any more than it will save you.
red,I save myself.
caesar,Is there anything left... of you to save?
maurice,[You are very brave.]
the girl,[...Brave?]
maurice,[You are...]
bad ape,Come!   Come see!
rocket,[This is the ape I told you about.]
bad ape,...Bad Ape.  Bad Ape... Bad Ape...
rocket,[What's wrong?]
rocket,[There's a problem.]
rocket,"[We can't dig any further, it will flood the whole tunnel!]"
lake,"[If we don't dig further, we'll never get to the children! How are we going to get them out?]"
caesar,[We must leave tonight!]
rocket,[How...?]
boyle,Hey -- you animals!
boyle,Who did that?!
the colonel,Least you can take comfort... Your struggle ends... Ours goes on... Nature still has the power to wipe us off this planet at any moment... Killed the dinosaurs with a single meteor.
caesar,...Malcolm?
the colonel,"I think that was his name, yes."
caesar,He... was a friend.
the colonel,He said you were remarkable.   More than just an animal... 
caesar,What... happened to this man?
the colonel,I shot him.
rocket,[...What was that?]
rocket,[Do you think he knows we're up to something?]
caesar, [Wait till he turns out his lights.]
rocket,[The sun will be up soon...]
caesar,[We go now. Or die trying.]
caesar," I love you, son..."
bad ape,"It's ok, little ones... come, come."
bad ape,Go!   Go go go...!
rocket,[Hurry!   Let's go!]
caesar,"By the time the sun rises, you'll all be on your way... to a new home.  Hurry, you must go."
rocket,[Without you? No...]
caesar,Maurice was right. I am like Koba. He could not escape his hate...  And I still cannot escape mine. He took too much from me.
soldier,Holy shit -- they're here!!!
preacher,Jesus Christ...
bad ape,Hurry!   Go go go!
rocket,[Let me through!]
gunner, LOOK!!! THE APES!!!
gunner,"Kill them, man!!!   Kill them all!!!"
caesar,Don't worry... You are all home now. Apes are strong. With... or without me.
maurice, Son will know... who was father... and what Caesar... did... for us.
