Speaker,Dialogue
trainer," Remember, parents don't want photos where their child isn't smiling. Some children may not want to smile. It is your job to coax a smile out of them. A good line to remember is: ""Santa thinks everybody should be happy. Can you smile for Santa?"" A camera can only copy a child's smile -- it will take you to put it there."
trainer,"If the child will not smile, the Photo Elf will go ahead and take the picture anyway. Now, it is a good Santa's job to smile as well -- I know with the big white beard your smile will be partially hidden, so you must learn to smile with your eyes. They show warmth and can be very expressive."
trainer,"Remember you have been chosen for the starring role of Santa Claus. Your portrayal of this beloved character will have a major impact on every child you meet. Keep in mind at all times that to them, you aren't a man dressed up like Santa, you are Santa."
mother,"Hurry boys, we're gonna miss Santa! She drags them across the street toward the looming art-deco monolith that is the big-city department store."
older child,There!
photo elf," My, what a darling picture! Are you certain you only want the single? Additional photos come in handy as gifts for grandma and grandpa or a wonderful remembrance for friends."
mom,"That's all right, I'll just take the single."
santa, Uh-huh... yeah... done.
bratty kid,I saw you in another mall.
santa, Right... Good for you.
bratty kid,You're not really Santa. If you were Santa you could do magic.
santa, You want magic?
santa,"There, I just made you disappear."
santa,...That it?
santa,...Thank fuckin' Christ.

gin,"""Fuck stick""?"
chipeska,"Yes, I thought it was strange too, but you know, I, I, I, I, uh, I, his little friend promised he wouldn't say it in front of the children. Which is fine because, you know, urn, there's an adult world and a child's world and that's okay. I'm not a censor."
gin,Little friend?
chipeska,"Yes, a, a, a dwarf. Or midget... a, a, I don't know what he's called exactly but... a little guy. Little. Billy Barty. God rest. But thin fingers. Not the fat sausage fingers."
gin,"""Little people,"" that's what they like."
chipeska,"Ah, yes, right."
gin,"So ""fuck stick,"" that's all?"
chipeska,"Well, no, there was something else..."
chipeska,"Now don't get me wrong. I was against the Clinton impeachment. What a man does with his penis -- Oval Office, Women's Big & Tall -- it's not for the American people to say."
gin,Right.
chipeska,"But when you're dealing with children, a tender sensibility, a position of trust -- then perhaps, someone who has screaming orgasms with large women --"
gin,Mm.
chipeska,Though I can't fire him for that.
gin,No.
chipeska,Sizisra. They'd say.
gin,Sure.
chipeska,Not true. I am no siziat. But I can see the picket line now.
gin,"Yeah, a big fuckin' fat one."
chipeska,"They'd all say, If it had been a supermodel or, uh..."
gin,"Heeyeah. Unfair practices. A lot of special pleading. Bitch, bitch, bitch. Fuckin' broads."
chipeska,But -- I can't help it -- the guy makes me uneasy.
gin,Well sure. Santa fuckin' someone in the ass.
chipeska,So maybe there's something I could fire him for.
gin,Yeah. Yeah. I getcha.
chipeska,Do you? Do you think you could find something?
gin,Oh shit yeah. There's always something.
marcus,"...Motherfucker... Oh, you lousy fucking motherfuck..."

willie,"Ah, it's like shooting fish in a barrel -- there's no sport,"

willie,"Yeah, well..."
willie,"...wish in one hand and shit in the other, see which fills up faster."
kid,Okay.
willie,"I'm gonna be staying here a while. Things are all fucked up at the North Pole. Mrs. Santa, she... she walked in on me fuckin' her sister. So I'm out on my fuckin' ass. She's taking half of everything... This'll do."
willie,"...I'm gonna crash here. You and me, like, you know, bachelors."
kid,Do you and Mrs. Santa have kids?
willie,No. Thank the fuck Christ.
kid,What about the elves?
willie,"Yeah, well, them. They stay with Mrs. Santa. I get 'em on weekends. Run me a bath, will ya?"
kid,What about the reindeer?
willie, Don't start with the fucking reindeer.

marcus,You said that last night you stupid fuck!
willie,"Ah, shit! Fuck you!"

willie,"You shittin' me?! He doesn't have fucking friends! Not even an imaginary one! Unless he got ditched by him! He's just a fuckin' misfit! Lives with his grandma who sits drooling in front of the TV! Every once in a while she gets up to play soccer with her tits! What, she's gon' rat me out? She don't know her ass from last Tuesday!"

willie,"What're you, fuckin' Sigmund Sawed- Off Freud? The shrunken fuckin' shrink?"
marcus,"Yeah, that's right, shit-for-brains, talk about my height. Make it about something safe. 'Cause you're an emotional fucking cripple. Your soul is dog shit. Every single fuckin' thing about you is ugly."

prisoner,...Many accounting questions are not cut-and-dried --
gin,You live at 41 Sage Terrace?
prisoner, Is it Granma? Is my son alright?
gin,They're fine. Do you have any house guests?
prisoner,...House guests?
gin,Thanks much for your time. God bless.
prisoner,...Who are you? WHO ARE YOU?
gin,"Well, it's fucked."

chipeska, Oh.

chipeska,Nothing?
gin,"No. Nothing. I mean, shit, he curses, yeah. But never around children."
chipeska,Oh.
gin,"No criminal record, no parking tickets f'Christ's sake, no bad habits, even. Sex, yeah. But man is a sexual being."
chipeska,Yeah.
gin,"Fuckin' Darwinian. Can't do shit about that, Jack."
chipeska,NO.
gin,Wouldn't want to.
chipeska,Yeah. No. Of course not. I'm not advocating celibacy.
gin,Hope not. End of the human fuckin' race.
chipeska,Yes.
gin,Fucks large women. What can I say.
voices,Loser! Dipshit!
voice,Wedgie!
child,Pokemon.
willie,Done.
marcus,Next!
kid,Santa here?
marcus,Oh jeez.
willie,Is that your underwear?
kid,Part of it.
willie,Where's the rest? Never mind. What do you want?
kid,"I was thinking I wanted a purple stuffed elephant, not pink, but now I changed my mind."
willie,What.
kid,Now I don't want an elephant at all. I want a gorilla named Davy for beating up the skateboard kids who pull on my underwear and he could take his orders from the talking walnut so it wouldn't be my bad thing.
willie,"...You know when I was your age, I didn't need no fuckin' gorilla, and I wasn't any bigger than you. One day I came crying home to Dad because four kids had beat me up, and you know what he did?'"
kid,He make it all better?
willie,No. He kicked my ass. You know why?
kid,You went bathroom on Mommy's dishes?
willie,What the fuck? No.
kid,He try to teach you not to cry and be a man.
willie,"Nope, it was because he was a mean, drunk son of a bitch. When he wasn't busy busting my ass, he was puttin' out cigarettes on my neck."
kid,Uh-huh...
willie,"The world's fuckin' unfair -- it don't give ya nothing. You can wish all you want but you gotta take what you need. Stand up for yourself... stop being such a pussy and kick those kids in the balls or something.  Or don't, I don't give a shit. Just leave me the hell out of it."
kid,"'Kay. Thanks, Santa."
willie,"Okay, go ahead..."
willie,...Get the fuck outta here...
kid,'Kay...
marcus, Time for the next lucky boy or girl to --
marcus,What gives? Where's the grandson?
gin,"Open the rope there, Marcus."
marcus,I know you?
gin,Not yet.
willie,"Santa don't do grab-ass, cowboy."
gin,Act natural.
willie,Huh? What?
willie,...What the fuck?!
gin,"You are Willie Tugboat Soke and you are Marcus ""The Prince"" Skidmore. On Christmas Eve, you're gonna rob this store blind. What say we go somewhere private?"
gin,"Research, that's how. I'm a department store detective Sherlock, that's what I do. Seven cities in seven years. Pretty impressive. The stores change, your names change. You always get away clean. Yeah, pretty darn impressive. But let's face facts -- you all are a couple of half-bucket small-timers. Because of your physical attributes you've found a niche. I respect that. But you've also been caught. By me. So this is the way how we gonna do things. I don't want to take over, I don't even want to change your scam. Whatever you guys do, it works. All I want is a taste. When the deed is done, we part ways. I buy a ranch in Havasu, you take your little medicine show back on the road."
marcus, How much?
gin,Half.
willie,"Now you listen here, you --"
marcus,"Easy! Easy! Just back off, Willie. I can handle this."
marcus,Okay. Thirty percent. There's three of us. Thirty percent. That's fair.
gin,Half.
marcus,I meant thirty-three.

marcus,Fooooooorty... eight.
gin,Half.
marcus,Forty-nine?
gin,Half.
marcus,Well...
marcus,...what's one point.
gin,"Down the middle on the dough, and any merchandise you take I look over and cherry-pick."
marcus,"No! Money's one thing, but --"
gin,"It ain't Chinese menu, jagoff. I tell yea how the way it's gonna be. This is pricks ficks."
willie,...Pricks ficks?
marcus,"Ah, he's a fuckin' moron."
willie,"Yeah, well I guess that's how you got the upper hand."
marcus,Fuck you.
willie,Negotiating.
marcus,"Fuck you -- you don't like it, next year, fuck off. I can always get another box jockey."
willie,"Yeah, and I can get another midget."
marcus,"Yeah? Where? You see us hangin' off of fuckin' trees? Like fuckin' crab apples? And even if we did, you'd never front your own racket. 'Cause you got no discipline and zero fuckin' initiative. You'd fall apart without me. You're just too fuckin' pathetic --"
willie,"Yeah, yeah."
marcus,"-- too fuckin' pathetic for words, you fuckin' loser. And you fuckin' know it."
grandma,Roger! You're home. Let me fix you some sandwiches.
willie,"Ah, fuck it."
kid,...Santa?
willie,Yeah.
kid,What're you doing?
willie,"Ah, nothin'."

willie,"Later today, when the paramedics come and bag up Santa..."
willie,...make sure the cops get this letter. It tells about all the bad things that -- that -- what the fuck happened to your eye?
kid,Umm...
willie,Well goddamnit...
kid,I didn't know he did that.
willie,I think I've turned a corner.
marcus, Yeah? You fucking Petites now?
willie,"No no. No; I beat the crap out of some kids today -- but, you know, for a purpose. It really made me feel pretty good about myself -- like I did something constructive for a change. Accomplished somethin'."
marcus,"...You need many years of therapy. Many, many, many, many, many... many fucking years of therapy."
lois,Just looking...
willie,...Hello?
willie,...Granma?
willie,Granma...
willie,...Oh jeez.
sue,Oh my God...
grandma,Roger!
grandma,...You're home. Let me fix you some sandwiches.
willie, No thanks.
sue, Hello little boy.
kid,Hello. Santa?
willie, ...yes?
kid,I know that Christmas Eve is in a couple days and you have to fly around and give presents to the world and after that you won't be around no more.

willie,"...As for my little helper, I am sorry to have to tell you that him and his prune-faced mail-order-wife are gonna be exploring mountains with your dad. I hope your dad doesn't go sucking shit from them like I did. Meanwhile, I told the cops you had no one to take the fuck care of you, so they set it up with Mrs. Santa's sister watching you till your Dad gets back in one year and three months. They made her a Guardian Pro-Temp or some such shit... anyway, she makes better money than bartending and seems to like you and your house and Jacuzzi."
