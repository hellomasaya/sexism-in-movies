deagol," I've got a fish, Smeagol!"
smeagol," Go on, pull it in."
smeagol,"Give us that, Deagol, my love!"
deagol,Why?
smeagol,"Because its my birthday, and I wants it."
gollum,It's mine! My own. It came to me.
smeagol, My Precious.
gollum,"Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We must go, yes, we must go at once!"
sam,"Haven't you had any sleep, Mr Frodo?"
frodo,No . . . no it isn't. It isn't midday yet. The days are growing darker.
gollum,"Come on, must go, no time ..."
sam,Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat.
gollum,". . . no time to lose, silly."
sam,Here.
frodo,What about you?
sam," I'm not hungry - leastways, not for lembas bread."
frodo,Sam.
frodo,For what?
sam,The journey home.
gollum,"Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close to Mordor! No safe places here. Hurry! Shhh."
pippin,"I feel like I ' m back at the Green Dragon, after a hard days work."
merry,"Only, you've never done a hard days work."
gimli,"You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led us on, and now we find you feasting and smoking."
pippin," We are sitting on a field of victory, enjoying a few well-earned comforts. The salted pork is particularly good."
gimli, Salted pork?
gandalf, Hobbits!
merry,"We're under orders from Treebeard, who's taken over management of Isengard.  WIDE: GANDALF leads the company through the flotsam and jetsam which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the TOWER ... TREEBEARD, the GIANT ENT, strides towards them, ALARMING all but GANDALF."
treebeard,"Huraroom ... Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad you've come. Wood and water, stock and , stone I can master, but there's a wizard to be managed here ... Locked in his tower."
gandalf,"And there Saruman must remain, under your guard, Treebeard."
gimli,Let's just have his head and be done with it.                            .
gandalf, No. He has no power any more.
treebeard,"The filth of Saruman is washing away ... Trees will come back to live here, young trees . . . wild trees."
gandalf," Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad!"
theoden,Tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country. Hail the victorious dead!
eowyn,Westu Aragorn hal.
theoden,I am happy for you.
eowyn, You are both honourable men.
theoden,It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our people to victory.
aragorn,No news of Frodo?
gandalf,No word ... nothing.
aragorn,We till have time.
gandalf,Do we know that?
aragorn, What does your heart tell you?
gandalf," Yes - yes, he is alive."
smeagol,"Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They stole it from us. Kill them . . . kill them ... kill them both!"
gollum, Shhh! Quiet!
smeagol,"They knows, they knows, they suspects us."
gollum,"And we will . . ,- Smeagol did it once. . .  . . . He can do it again."
smeagol,We must get the Precious. We must get it back.
gollum,"Patience, patience, my love. First we must lead them to her."
smeagol,We lead them to the windy stairs.
gollum," Yes, the stairs ... and then?"
smeagol,"Up, up, up, up the stairs we go . . . until we come to . . .  ... the Tunnel!"
gollum," And when they go in, there's no coming out. She's always hungry, she always needs to feed. She must eat, all She gets is filthy Orcses."
smeagol,"And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, Precious?               ."
gollum," No . . . not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats . . ."
smeagol,And take it for Me! 
gollum, For us . . .
smeagol,"Yes, we, we meant for us . . .  Go Hum! Go Hum!"
gollum, The Precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead!
sam,"            ,     . You treacherous little toad!"
gollum, No! Not! Help! Master!
frodo,"No, Sam! Leave him alone!"
sam, I heard it from his own mouth        he means to murder us!
smeagol,"Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly! He's a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol and who makes up nasty lies!"
sam,You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!
frodo,Sm. . . a
sam,Call me a liar! You're a liar!
frodo,"Sam! If you scare him off, we're lost."
sam,"I don't care! I can't do it, Mr Frodo. I won' t wait around for him to kill us !"
frodo, I'm not sending him away.
sam,"You don't see it, do you? He's a villain!"
frodo," We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side."
sam," I'm on your side, Mr Frodo."
frodo,"I know, Sam, I know.  You must trust me."
legolas,"The stars are veiled, something stirs in the east . . . A sleepless malice."

pippin,Gandalf! Forgive me.
pippin, A tree ... There was a white tree . . . in a courtyard of stone . . . It was dead!
gandalf,Minas Tirith???  Is that what you saw?
pippin, I saw . . . I saw him . . . I could hear his voice in my head.
gandalf,And what did you tell him? Speak!
pippin,"He asked me my name, I didn't answer . . . he hurt me . . ."
gandalf,What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?
gandalf,"There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool, but an honest fool he remains. He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring."
"final revision - october, 2003 19.",CONTINUED:
theoden, Tell me. Why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours?
aragorn, I will go.
gandalf, No!
aragorn,They must be warned.
gandalf,They will be.  Understand this . . . things are now in motion that cannot be undone.
gandalf,"Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin, Took, you are the worst. Hurry, hurry!"
pippin, Where are we going?
merry,Why did you look - why do you always have to look?
merry,You never can.
pippin,"                . . . . ,.; I'm sorry, alright? I won't do it again."
merry,"Don't you understand ... the Enemy thinks you have the Ring . . . he's going to be looking for you, Pip. They have to get you out of here!"
pippin,And you. You're coming with me . . . Merry?
merry,Come on!
pippin, How far is Minas Tirith?
gandalf,Three days ride as the Nazgul flies and you'd better hope we don't have one of those on our tail.
merry,Here - something for the road.
pippin,The last of the Longbottom Leaf.
merry,"I know you've run out . . . you smoke too much, Pip."
pippin,But we'11 see each other soon?
merry,I don't know . . . I don't know what's going to happen.
gandalf,"Run Shadowfax, show us the meaning of haste."
pippin, Merry!
elf escort,We cannot delay.
elrond,Arwen?
arwen,You have the gift of foresight - tell me what you have seen.
elrond,I looked into your future and I saw death.

arwen,But it is not lost ...
elrond,Nothing is certain.
arwen,"Some things are certain. If I leave him now I will regret It forever.  Ada, it is time."
arwen,Ada ...
elrond,Your hands are cold.  The life of the Eldar is leaving you.
arwen,"This was my choice. Ada ... Whether by your will or not, there is no ship now that can bear me hence."
gandalf,We have just passed into the realm of Condor!
gandalf,Minas Tirith . . . City of the Kings.
gandalf,"Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of the King."
"final revision - october, 2003 30.",CONTINUED:
gandalf,"Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor."
denethor, Perhaps you come to explain this?
"final revision - october, 2003 31.",CONTINUED:
gandalf, Pippin!
pippin,"I offer you my service, such as it is, in payment of this debt."
gandalf," My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming ... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As Steward, you are charged with the defence of this city. Where are Condor's armies?"
denethor," You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me."
gandalf, Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King - Steward!
denethor," The rule of Condor is mine, and no others!"
gandalf,Come.
pippin,"So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial position . . . I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting . . . do they?"
gandalf,"You're in the service of the Steward now - you're going to have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took . . .  Guard of the Citadel!"
pippin,It's so quiet.
gandalf,It's the deep breath before the plunge.
pippin,"I don't want to be in a battle . . . but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse.                                L                                   : Is there any hope, Gandalf - for Frodo and Sam?"
gandalf,"There never was much hope.  PIPPIN looks up at him, unnerved. GANDALF gives him a small self-deprecating smile . . .  GANDALF  Mercenaries from the coast . . . All will answer Mordor' s call.  ANGLE ON: GANDALF . . . he is almost talking to himself now .. like a man unable to prevent a sure disaster."
gandalf,"This will be the end of Gondor as we know it. Here the hammerstroke will fall hardest.  INSERT IMAGE: The BATTLE-SCARRED CITY of OSGILIATH - last bastion between MINAS TIRITH and MORDOR . . .  GANDALF V/0 If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this city will be gone.  "
pippin,But we have the White Wizard. That's got to count for something.
gandalf,"The Witchking of Angmar . . .          ,           . ; You've met him before . . ."
gollum," The Dead City, very nasty place, full of ... enemies."
sam,"No, Mr Frodo!"
gollum, Not that way!
sam,No!
frodo, They're calling me!
gollum,Hide! Hide!
gandalf, We come to it at last ... the great battle of our time.
gollum," Come, hobbits. We climb - we must climb!"
gandalf," The board is set, the pieces are moving."

aragorn,The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit! Condor calls for aid!
theoden,Then Rohan will answer. Muster the Rohirrim!
theoden,"Assemble the army at Dunharrow - as many men as can be found. You have two days ... On the third, we ride for Condor ... and war!"
aragorn,You ride with us?

faramir,No.
pippin, You've seen Frodo and Sam?
gandalf,Where? When?
faramir,"In Ithilien, not two days ago. Gandalf - they are taking the road to the Morgul Vale."
gandalf, . . . And then the Pass of Cirith Ungol.
pippin,What does that mean? What's wrong?
gandalf, Faramir . . . Tell me everything.
gollum,"Careful, Master - careful! Very far to fall. Very dangerous on the stairs."
gollum,"Come, Master."
sam, Mr Frodo!
gollum,Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has Smeagol ever done to him? Master?
witch king, Send forth all legions. Do not stop the attack until the city is taken. Slay them all.
gothmog,What of the Wizard?
witch king,I shall break him.
soldier 1, Where are Theoden's riders?
soldier 2,Will Rohan's army come?
soldier 1,Mithrandir?
pippin," Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor, in peace or war, in living or dying, from this hour henceforth, until my lord release me, or death take me."
denethor,"And I shall not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is given ..."
faramir,What would you have me do?
denethor,I will not yield the River and Pelennor unfought - Osgiliath must be retaken.
faramir,"My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun."
denethor,Much must be risked in war. Is there a Captain here who still has the courage to do his Lord's will?
faramir," You wish now that our places had been exchanged, that I had died and Boromir had lived?  CLOSE ON: For a brief second, DENETHOR seems to hesitate, then ..."
denethor," Yes, I wish that."
faramir,"Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do what I can in his stead."
denethor,That will depend on the manner of your return.
sam,"What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we?"
smeagol," Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say ""Sneak!"", ""Sneak!"". Very nice friends, oh yes, my Precious, very nice."
sam,"Alright, alright - you just startled me is all.  What were you doing?"
smeagol, Sneaking!
sam,"Fine, have it your own way."
sam,It's always dark here -
frodo, What? That's all we have left!
sam, He took it! He must have!
gollum," Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol. Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread!"
sam,You're a lying wretch! What did you do with it?
frodo,He doesn't eat it . . . he can't have taken it.
gollum,"What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses!  He took it! He took it! I seen him, he's always stuffing himself when Master's not looking!"
sam, That's a filthy lie!
frodo, Sam! Stop it!
sam, I'll kill him! I'll kill him!
frodo,"No, Sam!"

frodo, I ' m alright.
sam,"No, no, you're not alright! You're exhausted! It's that Gollum; it's this place; it's that thing around your neck. I could help a bit . . . I could carry it for a while - share the load."
frodo,Get away!
sam, I don't want to keep it . . . I just want to help!
gollum,See! See! He wants it for himself.
sam," Shut up, you! Go away. Get out of here."
frodo," No, Sam . . . it's you."
sam, But . . . he's a liar . . . he's poisoned you against me.

gandalf,Faramir! Your father's will has turned to madness! Do not throw away your life so rashly!
faramir, Where does my allegiance lie if not here?
gandalf,"Your father loves you, Faramir!  And will remember it before the end."
denethor,"Can you sing, Master Hobbit?"
pippin," Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my own people ... but we have no songs for great halls and evil times . . . we seldom sing of anything more terrible than wind or rain."
denethor,"And why should your songs be unfit for my halls, or for hours such as these. Come - sing me a song!"

theoden,"Grimbold, how many?"
grimbold,"I bring five hundred men from the Westfold, my Lord."
denethor, Where are the riders from Snowbourne?
theoden, Six thousand spears . . . less than half of what I had hoped for . . .
aragorn,Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.
theoden,More will come.
legolas, The horses are restless . . . And the men are -;. quiet ..?
eomer,They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain . . .

gimli,Let's find some food.
eowyn,There! A true Esquire of Rohan.
merry,Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous.  It isn't even sharp.

eowyn,To the Smithy .- go!
eomer,You should not encourage him.
eowyn,And you should not doubt him.
eomer,I do not doubt his heart ... Only the reach of his arm.

aragorn,She stayed?
elrond,She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor.
aragorn,"It will not be our end, but his."
elrond,"You ride to war, but not to victory. Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith - this you know - but in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river . . ."
aragorn,There are none.

elrond, There are those who dwell in the mountain.
aragorn,"Murderers, traitors - you would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing. They answer to no-one."
elrond,They will answer to the King of Condor.
aragorn,Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil . . .
elrond,The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth.
eowyn,Why are you doing this?
aragorn,Eowyn . . .
eowyn,"We need you here -                    , "
aragorn,Why have you come?
eowyn, Do you not know?
aragorn, It is but a shadow and a thought that you love . . . I cannot give you what you seek.
gimli,And just where do you think you're off to?
aragorn,"Not this time ... This time you must stay, my friend."
gimli,"You might as well accept it - we're going with you, laddie."
gamling,Lord Aragorn!
gamling,He leaves because there is no hope.
theoden,He leaves because he must.
gamling,Too few have come. We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.
theoden,"No, we cannot . . .  But we will meet them in battle, nonetheless."
theoden, I have left instruction: the people are to follow your rule in my stead ... take up my seat in the Golden Hall ... long may you defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.
eowyn,"What other duty would you have me do, my Lord?"
theoden," Duty? ... No, I would have you smile again - not grieve for those whose time has come."
gimli,What kind of an army would linger in such a place?
legolas,"One that is cursed ... Long ago the Men of the Mountain swore an oath to the last King of Condor - to come to his aid, to fight, but when the time came, when Condor's need was dire, they fled ... Vanishing into the darkness of the mountain ... And so Isildur cursed them - never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge."
gimli, The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.
legolas," The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead, and the Dead keep it. The way is shut."
aragorn,Brego!
gimli,"Well, this is a thing unheard of ... An Elf will go underground when a Dwarf dare not.  Oh! I ' d never hear the end of it!"
theoden,We must ride light and swift. It's a long road ahead ... and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight.
merry,All my friends have gone to battle. I would be ashamed to be left behind!
theoden,It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith. None of my Riders can bear you as a burden.
merry,But . . . I want to fight!

aragorn,I hold your oath fulfilled . . . Go. Be at peace.
pippin,Merry ...?
merry, Are you going to leave me?
pippin,"No Merry, I'm going to look after you."
shagrat,"Hey! Hands off - that shiny shirt, that's mine."
gorbag,"It's going to the Great Eye, along with everything else . . ."
shagrat,I don't take orders from stinking Morgul rats!
gorbag," You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in your guts!"
sam, And that's for my old Gaffer!
gorbag,Stop your squeaking you dunghill rat!
sam,Not if I stick you first!
frodo, Sam!!!
sam,Come on.
frodo, It's too late. It's over . . . they've taken it. Sam - they took the Ring!!
sam," Begging your pardon, but they haven't."
frodo,Give it to me.
sam,"Come on, Mr Frodo, we'd best find you some clothes . . . you can't go walking through Mordor in naught but your skin."
sam,"We did it, Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor."
frodo,There are so many of them . . . So many. We'll never get through unseen.
sam,"We have to go in there, Mr Frodo. There's nothing for it. Come on. Let's just make it down the hill for starters."
gandalf,Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The darkness is deepening.
aragorn,"If Sauron had the .Ring, we would know it."
gandalf,"It's only a matter of time. He has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping."
gimli,Let him stay there. Let him rot. Why should we care?
gandalf,Because ten thousand Ores now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom. 
aragorn,No.
gandalf,How?
aragorn,Draw out Sauron' s armies - empty his lands. Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.
eomer,We cannot achieve victory from strength of arms .
aragorn,Not for ourselves . . . But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron' s eye fixed upon us. Keep him blind to all else that moves .
legolas,A diversion . . .
gandalf, Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not take the bait!
gimli,Certainty of death. Small chance of success. What are we waiting for?
sam,"Look, the Ores! They're moving off. You see, Mr Frodo - some luck at last."
sam,Take mine . . . there's a few drops left.
frodo,There'll be none left for the return journey.
sam," I don't think there will be a return journey, Mr Frodo."
sam,"Fo o g td w rd , e on"
pippin, Where are they?
aragorn,Let the lord of the Black Land come forth; let justice be done upon him.
aragorn,Pull back! Pull back!
sam,"It's gone, Mr Frodo."
aragorn,Hold your ground - hold your ground! Sons of Gondor - of Rohan . . . my brothers!
gimli,Never thought I ' d die fighting side by side with an Elf.
legolas, What about side by side with a friend?
gimli,Aye - I could do that.
sam, Do you remember the taste of strawberries?
sam,"Then let us be rid of it - once and for all! Come on, Mr Frodo. I can't carry it for you ... but I can carry you! Come on!"
aragorn, For Frodo . . .
sam," Look, Mr Frodo! We're almost there!       -.-."
gollum,Clever Hobbits to climb so high!
sam, Frodo!
pippin, Eagles . . .
sam, Frodo!
frodo,"I'm here, Sam."
sam, Destroy it - go on! Throw it in the fire!
frodo,The Ring is mine.
sam,No!        :
gollum,Precious! Precious!
sam,Give me your hand.
sam,"Yes, Mr. Frodo ... it's over now."
sam,Rosie Cotton dancing ... she had ribbons in her hair . . .  . . . if ever I was to marry someone . . . it would have been her . . . it would have been her.
frodo," I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee . . . here at the end of all things."
frodo,Gandalf?
gandalf,Now come the days of the King ...
aragorn,"This day does not belong to one man but to all. Let us together rebuild this world that we may share in the days of peace.  The CHEERS of his PEOPLE are DEAFENING ...  ARAGORN sings for his people ... Then WALKS in SLOW PROCESSION down the WHITE PAVED PATH as the CROWD BOW their heads in respect to their NEW KING ...  ARAGORN passes EOWYN and FARAMIR who bow before him ... EOMER steps FORWARD to bow in respect ...  TRUMPETS SOUND as a PROCESSION of ELVES, dressed in shimmering SILVERS and WHITES, led by LEGOLAS approach the KING ... LEGOLAS gestures behind him . . .  CLOSE ON: ARAGORN'S eyes scan amongst the ELVES  ANGLE ON: A BANNER carried aloft bearing the WHITE TREE of CONDOR in FULL FLOWER . . . the RANKS of ELVES part revealing:  ARWEN, eyes shining ... MORTAL now, but deeply in love ... carrying the STANDARD of CONDOR ... ARAGORN kisses her  ELROND looks on . . . his face breaks into a smile.  ARAGORN and ARWEN embrace.  ANGLE ON: ARAGORN and ARWEN walking through the CROWD towards four SMALL FIGURES who stand nervously at the end of the AVENUE . . .  ANGLE ON: ARAGORN and ARWEN look on FRODO, SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN, as they stand before them . . .  The FOUR HOBBITS, dressed in their OLD CLOTHES, clean and mended, bow their heads ...  ARAGORN raises his HAND.  ARAGORN  My friends ... you bow to no-one."
frodo,"It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam. It's never really healed."
frodo, Not quite . . . There's room for a little more.
bilbo, Frodo ... Any chance of seeing that old ring of mine ... the one I gave you?
frodo," Sorry, Uncle . . . I'm afraid, I lost it."
bilbo, Oh . . . pity. I should like to have held it one last time.
bilbo,"Oh! Well, here's a sight I have neverseen before."
"final revision - october, 2003 148,",CONTINUED:
galadriel,The power of the Three Rings is ended. The time has come for the Dominion of Men.
elrond, I Aear can ven na mar.
bilbo,I think I'm quite ready for another adventure.
gandalf,"Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now finished. Here at last, on the shores of the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship."
sam, What does he mean?
frodo," We set out to save the Shire, and it has been saved ... but not for me . . ."
sam, You don't mean that - you can't leave.
frodo,"The last pages are for you, Sam."
sam,Elanor!
sam,"Hello, little Frodo!"
