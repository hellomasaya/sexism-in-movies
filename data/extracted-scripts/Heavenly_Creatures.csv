juliet,Mummy!
juliet,Mummy!
pauline,Mummy!
pauline, It's Mummy!
pauline, She's terribly hurt . . .
juliet, Somebody's got to help us!
miss stewart,Sit!
miss stewart,"Good morning, gels."
miss stewart,"Miss Waller . . . class . . . this is Juliet Hulme. Juliet is joining us from St. Margaret's, and prior to that she spent some time at Queenswood in the Hawkes Bay."
juliet,"I am actually from England, Miss Stewart."
miss stewart,"Of course . . . Juliet's father is Dr. Hulme, the Rector of the University."
miss stewart,"Juliet's travelled all over the world, and I'm sure she'll be very eager to share her impressions of exotic lands across the seas with the gels of 3A. I'll leave you to it, Miss Waller. Juliet."
juliet,"Excuse me, Miss Waller . . . you've made a mistake."
juliet,"""Je doutais qu'il vienne"" is in fact the spoken subjunctive."
juliet,"You should have written ""vint."""
juliet,"You don't have to apologise, Miss Waller. I found it frightfully difficult myself . . . until I got the hang of it."
juliet,"That s all right, Mrs. Collins. I'm sure I can manage without one."
juliet,St. George and the Dragon.
juliet,"Oh, I haven't gotten around to drawing her yet. I was going to pop her on a rock, but I seem to have run out room."
juliet,"Sorry! I don't know if you've noticed, Mrs. Collin but I've actually drawn St. George in the likeness of world's greatest tenor-Mario Lanza!"
pauline, I think your drawing's fantastic!
pauline, Hello!
pauline," Got an A, Mum!"
pauline," He's Italian, Dad! The world's greatest tenor!"
pauline,Stop it! You're spoiling it! Go away!
juliet,Can I have another look?
juliet,That's so impressive!
juliet, I've got scars . . . they're on my lungs.
juliet,"I was in bed for months during the war, ravaged by respiratory illness."
pauline,Osteomyelitus turns your bones to chalk. It took them two years to drain all the muck out.
juliet,Cheer up! All the best people have bad chests and bone diseases! It's all frightfully romantic!
juliet,"Hi, Paul!"
juliet,0www!
juliet,"The evil Prince Runnymeade is escaping! Get him, Paul!"
juliet,The blighter's gone to ground!
juliet,"God! Jonty! Jonty-stop it! Go away! We're not playing anymore . . . go on, bugger off!"
juliet,"0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!"
pauline, It doesn't matter.
juliet,Of course it matters! It's Mario!
juliet, Mother!
juliet,Jonty broke Paul's record!
juliet,We must buy her another one!
pauline,"No, thank you."
juliet,Which one shall we play?
juliet,Daddy can study while we're playing records!
juliet," Paul? Oh, God! Paul . . . are you all right?"
pauline, I think I'm dying . . .
juliet," Don't . . . please! Please, don't!"
juliet, Paul!!!
pauline,Urrrgh! You've been eating onions.
juliet,You toad!
pauline," ""There's a light in her eye, Though she may try to hide it, She cannot deny, There's a light in her eye."""
pauline,"& JULIET  ""Her face is a dream, like an angel I saw . . ."
pauline,"& JULIET  ""But all that my darling can scream . . ."""
pauline, I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
juliet,Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
pauline,"But, we're all going to Heaven!"
juliet,"I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians."
juliet,"It's an absolute Paradise of music, art and enjoyment."
juliet,James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
pauline, Saint Mario!
juliet,To be known as He!
pauline,He . . .
juliet,Him.
pauline,Him . . .
juliet,This.
pauline,This . . .
juliet,That.
pauline,That . . .
pauline,It.
juliet,Absolutely not! Orson Welles! The most hideous man alive!
juliet,We give praise to . . . the saints!
pauline, I decided that my New Year's resolution is to be more lenient with others.
pauline, Aren't you going out?
pauline,This is a private function! Go away!
juliet,"Hello, Mrs. Rieper . . . it's so nice to meet you."
juliet,"And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!"
juliet,"Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council."
pauline,Dad!
juliet,"Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it."
juliet," She has deep discussions with unhappy couples and persuades them to have another go at it. In two years, she's only had four divorces. She should really be working for the U.N.!"
juliet," Mummy has a special technique called ""Deep Therapy."""
juliet,I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
pauline, It's my middle name.
juliet,I adore anything to do with the arts.
juliet,"Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head."
pauline,He's the manager!
juliet,"Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based."
pauline, We have decided how sad it is for other people that they cannot appreciate our genius . . .
pauline," . . . but we hope the book will help them to do so a little, though no one could fully appreciate us."
juliet,Charles clutches his wounded shoulder as he gallops into the courtyard.
pauline,Deborah awaits his return in their private boudoir at the very top of the tower.
juliet,He smells her scent from 50 paces and urges his steed onward!
pauline,"He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!"
juliet,"God, yes!"
juliet, I bet she gets up the duff on their first night together!
juliet,Something you wouldn't understand.
juliet,You're eight and a half and incredibly stupid!
juliet,Mummy . . . Pauline and I have decided the Charles and Deborah are going to have a baby. An heir to the throne of Borovnia.
juliet,We're calling him Diello.
juliet,Paul thought it up.
juliet," Are you going abroad, Daddy?"
juliet," You're not going, are you, Mummy?"
juliet,"But I should go, too!"
juliet,But- Hilda suddenly stands.
pauline, Julie! Julie!
juliet,"Look, Paul!"
pauline,What?
juliet,It's so beautiful!
pauline,What???
juliet,Come with me.
pauline," Today Juliet and I discovered the key to the Fourth World. We have had it in our possession for about six months, but we only realised it on the day of the Death of Christ. We saw a gateway through the clouds. Everything was full of peace and bliss. We then realised we had the key . . ."
pauline, . . . on this Day of Finding the Key to the Way through the Clouds.
pauline,"Push! . . . Breathe! . . . It's coming! . . . Oh, God!"
pauline,It's a boy! Deborah . . . we've got a son and heir!
juliet,I shall call him Diello.
pauline,You're such an incredible woman.
juliet,"I couldn't have done it without you, Charles."
juliet,". . . the Empress Deborah has the difficulty fending off her husband, who tries his way with her morning, noon and night . . ."
juliet,". . . However, the Queen's biggest problem is her renegade child, Diello. He has proven to be an uncontrollable little brighter, who slaughters his nannies whenever the fancy takes him . . ."
juliet,"No, Mrs. STEVE ns."
pauline,It's not rubbish!
juliet,"I really don't understand why you are upset, Mrs. STEVE n. I merely wrote an essay on the Royal Family as requested."
pauline,It doesn't say it has to be the Windsors!
pauline, Mrs. Hulme told me they had found out today that Juliet has tuberculosis on one lung. Poor Julietta. I nearly fainted when I heard. I had a terrible job not to cry.
pauline," I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too."
pauline,I'm not hungry.
pauline,I just want to be on my own for a while.
pauline,Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
pauline,But she'll have no one to look after her!
pauline, This evening I had a brainwave: that Juliet and I should write to each other as Charles and Deborah.
pauline, I wrote a six-page letter as Charles and a two-page letter as Paul.
pauline, She has entered into the spirit of the thing greatly!
juliet," My dear Charles, I miss you and adore you in equal amounts and long for the day we will be reunited, but as I languish here, in this house of disease and decrepitude, my mind turns-with increasing frequency- to the problem of our son . . ."
juliet," Although only 10, Diello has thus far killed 57 people and shows no desire to stop . . . it worries me, Charles."
pauline, My dearest darling Deborah. Affairs of state continue to occupy my time.
pauline, I have to report that the lower classes are terrifically dull.
pauline, Only yesterday I was compelled to execute several peasants just to alleviate the boredom . . .
pauline," . . . Diello insisted on coming along . . . in fact, he made such a fuss that I had to let him yield the ax himself. Heads did roll! Not just the prisoners, but the royal guard, my valet and several unfortunate copped it as well . . ."
juliet," Oh, Charles . . . I am despair enough to put Diello in the hands of the Cardinal, in hope that a good dose of religion will set the young chap on the right path."
juliet,I'm so happy to see you!
juliet,Thank you so much!
juliet, I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
pauline,I love the colour!
juliet,It's for you.
juliet, I'm saving them for a rainy day.
juliet," They sent me off to the Bahamas ""for the good of my health."" They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands ""for the good of my health."""
juliet,"I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued."
juliet,"Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?"
pauline,"Yes, but there's nothing between them. Deborah would never go for a commoner. Nicholas has got his eye on Gina, an amazingly beautiful gypsy."
pauline,Juliet made it!
pauline,"Oh, yes! It's all worked out!"
pauline, You'll never guess what's happened!!
juliet,What??
pauline,John has fallen in love with me!
juliet,That idiot boarder?
juliet,How do you know? Did he tell you?
pauline,Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
juliet, Is that why you haven't replied to my last letter?
pauline,"No, silly. I'm just teasing. He's only a stupid boy!"
pauline,Whaddya want?
pauline, Shut the door.
pauline,You should have worn your slippers.
pauline,Just for a minute.
pauline," To think that so much could happen in so little time, caused by so few. A terrible tragedy has occurred . . ."
pauline," ""Now, gels . . . it isn't ooo, it's eee,"" and she goes . . . ""eeeeee"" as if someone is jabbing a pin into her! Silly old trout!"
pauline,"And then in history, we've got this senile old bat, who goes . . .  God! It's no wonder I don't excel in history!"
pauline,"0f course, my darling Nicholas."
pauline,I like Nicholas much better!
pauline,What are you doing?
pauline,Bloody hell!
pauline, I lay there mesmerised. It was just too frightful to believe . . .
pauline, When I got up I found Father had told Mother . . .
pauline," I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture."
pauline,Can I go now?
pauline,"Well, I guess I take after you then!"
pauline,You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
pauline," I am terribly cut up. I miss Nicholas terrifically. Mother thinks I will have nothing more to do with him, but little she knows . . ."
pauline, Nicholas was pleased that I was so early.
pauline," We sat around and talked for an hour and then went to bed. I declined the invitation at first, but he became very masterful and I had no option. I discovered that I had not lost my virginity on Thursday night. However, there is no doubt whatsoever that I have now . . ."
pauline,Charles!
pauline, Deborah!
pauline, Diello!
pauline,Deborah!
pauline,I've got to go home.
pauline, There are living among two dutiful daughters.
pauline," Of a man who possesses two beautiful daughters,"
pauline," You cannot know nor yet try to guess,/The sweet soothingness of their caress,"
pauline," The outstanding genius of this pair is understood by few,/They are so rare. . ."
juliet,Mummy!
pauline," Compared with these two, every man is a fool,/The world is most honoured that they should deign to rule,/And I worship the power of these lovely two,/ With that adoring love known to so few . . ."
pauline," 'Tis indeed a miracle, one must feel, That two such heavenly creatures are real,"
pauline," Hatred burning bright in the brown eyes with enemies for fuel,"
pauline," Icy scorn glitters in the gray eyes, contemptuous and cruel, Why are men such fools they will not realise,"
pauline, The wisdom that is hidden behind those strange eyes.
pauline, And these wonderful people are you and I.
pauline,No.
pauline,She nags me.
pauline,No.
pauline,They're silly.
pauline, No!
pauline," Mother woke me this morning and started lecturing me before I was properly awake, which I thought was somewhat unfair. She has brought up the worst possible threat now. She said that if my health did not prove I could never see the Hulmes again. The thought is too dreadful. Life would be unbearable without Deborah . . ."
pauline," l wish I could die. This is not an idle or temporary impulse. I have decided over the last two or three weeks that it would be the best thing that could happen together, and the thought of death is not fearsome."
pauline," My New Year's resolution is a far more selfish one than last year, so there is more probability of my keeping it. It is to make my motto: ""Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow you may be dead."""
pauline,My name is Gina!
pauline,What does old Stew want?
pauline,Who cares!
pauline,I'm educating myself!
pauline, What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
pauline, I don't wanna be in bloody school!
pauline,I think I'm going crazy.
juliet,"No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!"
pauline,Let's go overseas . . .
juliet,You mean travel by ourselves?
juliet,Where shall we go? Not the Bahamas; it's bloody awful!
juliet, Of course! It's so obvious!
juliet, I know . . . I'll lean back and put my hair on my shoulders-then I'll look just like Veronica Lake!
pauline, Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
juliet, Hurry up! I'm freezing!
pauline, Just a couple more . . .
juliet," I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!"
pauline, I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
juliet, They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
juliet,This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
pauline,I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
juliet,That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
pauline," I rose at 5:30 this morning and did housework before 8 o'clock, including taking Wendy her breakfast in bed. I feel very pleased with myself on the whole and also the future."
pauline, We are so brilliantly clever.
juliet,Direct hit! Gave his trousers a good soaking! Everyone will think he's peed himself!
juliet, Bloody Bill's sniffing around Mummy something chronic.
pauline,I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
juliet, That was what we were led to believe . . .
juliet, I was looking forward to the ambulance arriving . . .
juliet, But it wasn't like that at all!
juliet,Poor Mother was completely taken in.
pauline,Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
juliet,Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
pauline, Poor Father . . .
juliet," Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other."
pauline,"Just washing my hair now, Laurie. Won't be a moment."
pauline," Yes, yes, yes!"
pauline," I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!"
pauline, Mother gave me a fearful along the usual strain.
pauline, I rang Deborah immediately as I had to tell someone sympathetic how I loathed Mother.
juliet,The balloon has gone up!
juliet,"Don't try and fob me off! It's going to cost you a hundred pounds, or I'm blabbing to Daddy!"
juliet, I don't care what you do! Pauline and I are going to Hollywood. They're desperately keen to sign us up. We're going to be film stars!
juliet," It's all arranged . . . we don't need your bloody hundred pounds anyway, so stick it up your bottom!"
pauline, Deborah told me the stupendous news! I'm going out to Ilam as we have much to talk over.
pauline, Hello?
pauline, Deborah was still in bed when I arrived.
pauline, Dr. Hulme asked us to come into the lounge to have a talk with him.
pauline, The shock is too great to have penetrated my mind. It is so incredible. Poor Father. Dr. Hulme was absolutely kind and understanding . . .
pauline, He said we must tell him everything about our going to America. He was both hope-giving and depressing. We talked for a long time and Deborah and I were near tears by the time it was over.
pauline," What is to be the future now? We may all be going to Italy and dozens of other places, or not all. We none of us know where we are and a good deal depends on chance."
pauline, Dr. Hulme is the noblest and most wonderful person I have ever known of.
pauline," One thing Deborah and I are sticking to: through everything, we sink or swim together."
juliet," But Daddy, you can't just leave me with Mother!"
juliet," Is Gina coming, too?"
juliet, I'm not going to England without Gina!
pauline, The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
pauline,I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
pauline, You have to let me go!
pauline," I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out."
pauline, Anger against Mother boiled up inside me as it is she who is one of the main obstacle in my path. Suddenly a means of ridding myself of this obstacle occurred to me. If she were to die . . .
juliet," Everything's going to be okay, Gina. Mr. Perry's promised to give me 50 pounds for my horse . . ."
juliet, That's a hundred and twenty! It's another 30 pounds and we've got the fare!
juliet,But that's not true! I've got one.
pauline, I need my sodding parents' consent.
juliet," Don't cry, Gina . . . We're not going to be separated. They can't make us . . . they can't!"
pauline, I did not tell Deborah of my plans for removing Mother. I have made no decision yet as the last fate I wish to meet is one in a borstal. I am trying to think of some way.
pauline, We realised why Deborah and I have such extraordinary telepathy and why people treat us and look at us the way they do. It is because we are MAD. We are both stark raving MAD!
pauline," Dr. Hulme is MAD, as MAD as a March hare!"
pauline, It was the first time I had ever seen It. Deborah had always told me how hideous he was!
pauline, It is appalling. He is dreadful. I have never in my life seen anything in the same category of hideousness . . . but I adore him!
pauline," We talked for some time about It, getting ourselves more and more excited."
pauline, We enacted how each saint would make love in bed.
pauline," We spent a hectic night going through the saints. It was wonderful! Heavenly! Beautiful! And ours! We felt satisfied indeed. We have now learned the peace of the thing called Bliss, the joy of the thing called Sin."
pauline,I'm coming with you.
juliet,Yes . . .
pauline,I know what to do about mother.
pauline,We don't want to go to too much trouble . . . some sort of accident.
pauline,People die every day.
pauline, Our main idea for the day was to moider mother.
pauline," This notion is not a new one but this time it is a definite plan which we intend to carry out. We have worked it out carefully and are both thrilled by the idea. Naturally we feel a trifle nervous, but the pleasure of anticipation is great."
juliet,Only the best people fight against all obstacles . . .
juliet,. . . in pursuit of happiness.
pauline, We both spent last night having a simply wonderful time in every possible way.
pauline, I was picked up at 2:00 P.M. I have been very sweet and good. I have worked out a little more of our plan. Peculiarly enough I have no qualms of conscience.
pauline, I rose late and helped Mother vigorously this morning. Deborah rang and we decided to use a rock in a stocking rather than a sandbag. We discussed the moider fully. I feel very keyed up as though I were planning a surprise party. Mother has fallen in with everything beautifully and the happy event is to take place tomorrow afternoon. So next time I write in this diary Mother will be dead. How odd-yet how pleasing.
juliet,Mummy!
pauline,Mummy!
pauline, I am writing a little of this up on the morning before the death. I felt very excited and the night-before-Christmas-ish last night. I am about to rise.
juliet,Mummy!
juliet,I will . . . I'm so looking forward to it!
juliet,"Bye, Daddy . . . see you tonight."
juliet,Hello!
juliet,"Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper."
juliet,Fruit.
pauline,"Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night."
juliet," All right, then."
juliet,Do you feel sweaty? I feel sweaty.
pauline,It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
juliet,Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
pauline,I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
juliet,I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
pauline,. . . but in the end I decided against it. I thought it would spoil all their fun.
juliet, Affairs are much more exciting than marriages . . . as Mummy can testify!
pauline,"It's true! He was spotted in the lingerie department, eh, Wendy?"
juliet,I bet it was thermal underwear!
pauline,"I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!"
pauline,"Bye, Dad."
juliet,"Goodbye, Mr. Rieper."
juliet,Isn't it beautiful!
pauline,"Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!"
pauline, You have it.
juliet,"But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!"
pauline,"Go on, Mum, treat yourself."
pauline,"Look, Mother!"
juliet, I'm sorry.
pauline, No!
