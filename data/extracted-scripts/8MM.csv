Speaker,Dialogue
cab driver,Where to?
welles,"Follow that limousine.  Don't get too close, don't let it get too far away.  Just keep with it."
cab driver,You kidding?
welles,Nope.
cab driver,"Uh, listen... you're not supposed to be smoking in here.  I'm sorry, that's company policy..."
welles,"How about this... every cigarette I smoke, I give you five dollars?"
cab driver,"Okay... okay, yeah, that'd be good..."
amy,Welcome home.
welles,Do you know how much I missed you?
amy,I love you.
welles,I love you.
mrs christian,"This is Mister Longdale, my late husband's attorney."
welles,Of what sort?
longdale,You are a private investigator?
welles,Thank you.
welles,I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
welles,"Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a ""snuff film.""  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you."
welles,You... you need to go to the police.
welles,You don't have any other choice.
amy,I understand.
amy,I know.
amy,Why the gun?
welles,"What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens..."
director,"I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me..."
director,"Listen, maybe I can help after all. Why don't you come on back in... we'll see what we can do."
director,"It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after."
welles,You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
welles," Yeah, about five or six years ago. Anyway, do what you can to dig up your husband's old financial records, look for anything out of the ordinary..."
mrs mathews,Yes... ?
welles," Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator..."
welles,"I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter."
mrs mathews,"I don't understand, who are... ?"
welles,"I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?"
mrs mathews,"Yes, but..."
mrs mathews,Neil... Neil Cole.
welles," Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?"
mrs mathews,No.
welles," Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?"
welles,"I'm sorry, I know this isn't easy. Is there a more convenient time... ?  Can I buy you lunch, would that be alright?"
welles,"It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope."
mrs mathews,"They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?"
welles,That's exactly what I am.
mrs mathews,"I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV."
welles,"You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her."
welles,"It's refreshing to actually sit down and meet someone face to face, someone nice like you."
welles,"So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?"
mrs mathews,No.
welles,She just seemed... depressed... ?
mrs mathews,She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
welles,What was she running from?
mrs mathews,I don't know.
welles,"If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?"
mrs mathews,Yes.
welles,"September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared."
mrs mathews,We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
welles,Why do you think he did it?
mrs mathews,It got to be too much for him.
welles,"You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?"
mrs mathews,"There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left..."
welles,I didn't mean to...
mrs mathews,"You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either."
welles,I had to ask.  I apologize.
mrs mathews,No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
mrs mathews,People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?
welles,Of course.
mrs mathews,This is her room.
mrs mathews,"The police made a wreck of it, but I put it back exactly how it was. Just how she likes it."
welles,I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
mrs mathews,Okay.
welles," I've got a lead I have to follow through.  To be honest, I don't think I'm going to get very far. I miss you.  I love you."
mrs mathews,"Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church."
welles,We're all like that.
mrs mathews,Are you religious?
welles,No.
mrs mathews,You should be.
welles,I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
mrs mathews,What?
welles,"It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye."
mrs mathews,There wasn't one.  The police looked.
welles,Do you think the police did a good job?
mrs mathews,I don't know.  I think so.
welles,"It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something..."
mrs mathews,No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
welles,"If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place."
mrs mathews,How... how can you say that to me...?
welles,Will you let me look?
mrs mathews,My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
mrs mathews,Go ahead and look if you want.  I don't care what you do.
welles,You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?
mrs mathews,Yes.
welles,Do you ever consider... do you realize that Mary may never come back?
mrs mathews,"I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her."
welles,It's been six years.
mrs mathews,"What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  I'd choose to know."
welles,"Excuse me, I have to use your bathroom."
welles,Is this pretty much it?
welles,Just... just videos?
pierced clerk,What are you looking for?
welles,Nothing.
pierced clerk,Fuck-head.
max,Big date tonight?
welles, Yeah... guess so.
welles,Pardon me?
max,My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
max,"It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one."
welles,I'll risk it.
max,Thank you for shopping at Adult Bookstore.  Have a nice day.
welles,What are you reading?
max,Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
welles,Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
welles,Truman Capote.
max,I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
welles,Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
max," Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?"
welles, The way it's going I'm about ready to pack my bags...
welles, Goodnight.
welles,Remember me?
max,"Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would."
welles,I need some information.  Thought you might be able to help.
max, Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
welles,I'll be outside having a cigarette.
max," Cover me, Beth.  I'm taking a break."
max,"I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight."
welles,Good for you.
welles,How long you been working there?
max,"Three, four years."
welles,"What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?"
max,Max.
welles,"Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally..."
max,There's not much illegal.
welles,"Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now."
max,"You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me."
welles,I'm not a cop.
max,You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
welles,Not quite.
max,From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
welles,"Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money."
max,How much?
welles,How much do you make now?
max,"Four hundred a week, off the books."
welles,"Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days."
max,"Sounds good, pops."
welles,Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
max,"Tomorrow night, I get off at eight."
welles,"See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me ""pops."""
welles, ... Hello... ?
max,Come on.
goon,Are you a law enforcement agent or in any way affiliated with law enforcement?
max,"Fuck you, Larry."
goon, Are you a law enforcement... ?
welles,No.
one dealer,We're shutting down in fifteen minutes.  Fifteen minutes.
welles, What are these?
angry dealer,"Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free."
welles,Anything harder?
angry dealer,There's nothing harder.
welles,Snuff?
angry dealer,"What you see is what I got, mister."
welles,You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
angry dealer,There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
large man,You have to pay to come in here.
max,"You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go."
welles,Interesting theory.
max,"What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product."
welles,Child pornography.
max,"There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one."
welles,Snuff films.
max,I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
welles,What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
max,"First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer.  It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet.  Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants.  It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em.  But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes.  No one knows where it comes from.  That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth.  Those are zombies, hardcore junkies.  Their hands are permanently pruned.  They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister.  Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes.  Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations.  Interstate wire transfers.  Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows?  That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal.  There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is."
welles,How old are you?
max,Twenty-five.
welles,Where are your parents?
max,"I don't know, where are yours?"
welles,I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
max,"I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?"
welles,You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
max,"Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers."
welles,You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
max,"You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?"
welles,What about me?
max,I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
welles,A daughter.
max,"So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?"
welles,Good question.
mrs christian," My husband had five cash accounts he used to temporarily hold stock profits.  Between November of 1991 and March of 1992, he wrote one check out to cash from each account. He wrote these himself..."
welles, Okay...
welles,I'm not positive this means anything.
mrs christian," One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents..."
mrs christian,"Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars."
welles, You're joking.
welles,I'm here.
welles,"For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations.  Who knows?  It sure could have.  I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box."
welles,Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
welles,"You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian."
welles,Her name was Mary Anne Mathews.
nun,Yes... I remember Mary
welles,"You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure..."
nun,"She lived here for only about a month, if I recall correctly.  She didn't return one night.  She never came back.  I didn't know what to think..."
nun,Do you know what happened to her?
welles,I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
nun, Can you get that down for me?
nun,"No, the next shelf... there..."
welles,What is this?
nun,Those are her belongings.
welles,Her belongings?
nun,"That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture."
welles,Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
nun,"She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?"
welles,I'll do what I can.
welles,Cash.
salesperson,"Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?"
welles,"No, you may not."
salesperson,Okay.  Fine.
salesperson,"I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of..."
welles,"Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you."
salesperson,"Certainly, sir."
welles,"Come on, Eddie..."
welles,"That is you, isn't it, Eddie?"
welles, Two one two.
welles, What do you know about a guy called Dino Velvet?  Dino Velvet Films?
max," Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo."
max," His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish."
max,You're learning.
max,"Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money..."
welles," Alright, I get the picture."
welles,"Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses."
welles,"Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back."
mrs christian, Hello?
mrs christian, How are you?  Having any luck?
mrs christian,"I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment."
mrs christian,Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
welles," I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update."
welles,"I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve."
mrs christian,How will I get it to you?
welles,"If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it."
max,You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
welles,It's their Presidential Suite.
max,Great.
max,"Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?"
welles,"It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me?"
max,Dino Velvet.
welles,Max... wake up...
max,Wha... ?
welles," Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?"
max,He's one of the lunatics Dino uses. He's in a bunch of these.
max,Why?  He have something to do with whatever you're into?
welles,No... it's nothing... that's not him.
welles,Who is he?
max,"I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players..."
welles,"Who is he, his name?"
max,"Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself ""Machine,"" that's what they call him.  Machine."
max,They say he's half brain-dead from all the steroids he's using.
max,"He's a brutal motherfucker, man.  He loves what he does for a living."
welles,You don't need to be here.
max,What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
thug,You're in the wrong place.
welles,We're looking for Mr. Velvet.
thug,He's not here.
welles,"Why don't you tell him we're here to give him a large sum of money.  If he's not interested, we'll go."
thug,"You should leave now, before I have to remove you."
welles,"You heard the boss, Milo."
dino velvet,Come in.  Make yourself comfortable.
welles,It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
dino velvet,What can I do for you today?
welles,I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
dino velvet,"Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?"
welles,A fellow investor.
dino velvet,Hmm.
max,"You're the only one still shooting film and transferring it to video. Nobody appreciates that kind of integrity anymore... the grain, the gritty look you get."
dino velvet,"Well, I'm glad you appreciate it.  What would you say is your favorite piece?"
max,"I know if I had to pick, it'd be ""Choke,"" or ""Devil."""
welles,"""Devil"" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite."
dino velvet,You said something about money.
welles,Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
welles,That's five thousand dollars.
dino velvet,Is it?
welles,"Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations."
dino velvet,And they are?
welles,I want to watch you work.
dino velvet,I'll consider it.
welles,And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
dino velvet,Machine.
welles,"If it's not him, there's no deal."
dino velvet,He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
welles,We can do that.
dino velvet,"Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good."
dino velvet,You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
welles,I'd rather you didn't.
dino velvet,What's the problem?
welles,I'm camera shy.
dino velvet,"You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?"
welles,Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
welles," So, what do you say?"
dino velvet, I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
dino velvet, He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
welles, Where's that?
max,What's next?
welles,I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
max,Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
welles,Nope.
welles,This is for you.
max,What's this?
welles,It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
max,Look... that's awful generous and everything...
welles,"It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever."
welles,I'll see you around.
dino velvet,There you are.  Come join us.
welles, Hello.
dino velvet,You brought the money?
welles, Right here.
dino velvet,Excellent.
welles,Where are the women?
dino velvet,They should be here any minute.
welles, What are these for?
dino velvet,"Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?"
welles,Sure.
dino velvet,Machine and I were just talking about knifes.  The beauty of knifes...
dino velvet,He was saying how fascinated he is by their simple ability to be sharp. The ability of a piece of metal to be so thin that it is almost nothing...
dino velvet,"So close to nothingness that it cuts with minimum effort, because it's so non-intrusive.  Flesh is fooled.  It blooms open as the blade widens, but by then it's too late, because the knife's already doing its pure, simple damage."
dino velvet,"Ah, ours guests have arrived."
dino velvet,Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person?
welles,What are you... ?
dino velvet,Take out your gun!
dino velvet,Slowly.  Let me see it.
dino velvet,"Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully."
welles,"Look, I don't know what this..."
dino velvet,"Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat."
eddie,Is that him?
dino velvet," Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed."
dino velvet," Didn't know what to make of you at first, and you certainly had Eddie on pins and needles.  But, lo and behold, from out of the blue came an old business acquaintance to explain everything..."
eddie,"This is the fucker?  Motherfucker, doesn't look like anything..."
eddie,Doesn't look like shit.
dino velvet," You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?"
welles,I remember him.
longdale,Let's get this over with.
dino velvet,Fine idea.
dino velvet,"You're going to go get the film you received from Mrs. Christian, bring it here and put it in my hand.  And to save time, so we make this as efficient as possible, there's an incentive..."
welles,No...
dino velvet,Friend of yours?
welles,"Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go..."
dino velvet,Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
welles,He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
dino velvet,"Bring the film, or we kill him."
welles,"I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city..."
dino velvet,How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
dino velvet,"Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max."
eddie,"Move it, dirtbag... !"
dino velvet, Do hurry.
welles,"You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself."
longdale,Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
welles,"So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege."
longdale,That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
welles,"Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money."
longdale,I was well compensated.
welles,"That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?"
longdale,Never mind how I found you.
welles,Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
longdale,They're no friends of mine.
welles,"Except, you're willing commit murder with them."
longdale,None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
welles,"Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her."
welles,"You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one..."
longdale,Shut up.
welles,Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
longdale,Shut your mouth and drive!
welles,"Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?"
welles,Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
longdale,You're asking me why?
welles,I'm asking.
longdale,"A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain..."
welles,"Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?"
longdale,Isn't it incredibly obvious?
welles,Enlighten me.
longdale,Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
longdale,You've got four minutes till I call Mr. Velvet and let him know there's a problem.
manager,May I show you to a booth...
welles,"No, I've got it."
longdale,You almost went over your limit.
welles,Fuck you.
longdale,Give me the film.
longdale,Give me the film.
welles,"Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield."
welles,No!!
welles,You fuckers!
eddie,You're a dead man.
dino velvet,Leave him alone.
eddie,Fuck off.
eddie,What the fuck... !
dino,I promised him to Machine.
eddie,... sorry...
dino velvet,"First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles..."
welles,Don't... please...
dino velvet,And so it ends.  It's as if she never existed.
dino velvet,Don't blame yourself.  You were in way over your head.
welles,"Motherfuckers.  Small time, motherfuckers... !  Tell me something..."
welles,"I know why you did it, Dino, Eddie... but, why'd the lawyer do it?  Must have been a helluva lot of money, right?  One fuckload of money..."
welles,"So, what are you all still doing small time, huh?  What are you still doing in the sewer, Eddie?! Christian gave Longdale a million dollars to find him a snuff film. How much did you ever see... ?"
eddie,What's he talking about?
welles,"One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had..."
longdale,He's lying.
welles,"Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?"
eddie,What the fuck's he talking about?
longdale,Stay away from me.
dino velvet,"What's going on, Longdale?  Did this happen?"
eddie,"You sell us short, you fuck?"
longdale,"Stay back!  You have a gun, Eddie, show it to me.  Now!"
longdale,"Put it on the ground, kick it here..."
eddie,You fucking lawyer...
longdale,Move back!  All of you... move!
dino velvet,What were you thinking?
longdale,"Back off!  Everything's been taken care of, and I'm leaving now..."
dino velvet,"You're not going anywhere if you fucked us, lawyer."
longdale,I'm leaving.
eddie,"You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?"
dino velvet,You betrayed us.
longdale,Stay where you are!
longdale,Keep back!
dino velvet,You're not gonna live through this.
longdale,"Our business is done, I'm leaving, no one's going to stop me..."
dino velvet,Fuck you!
eddie,Fuck.
machine,He's mine!
welles,"No, no, no... please, don't kill me... please... !"
eddie,Do him good.
welles,"Back off, Eddie..."
welles,Stop Eddie!
welles, I swear to Christ I'll shoot you in the back... !
welles,"Come back, or I put a hole in him."
welles,"You might make it to your gun, but not before I shoot Machine.  And if I have to shoot him because of you, and I don't kill him, right after he kills me, he's gonna kill you."
welles, Take off the mask.
welles,Take it off!
machine,You got one bullet.
machine,"The only choice you have now, is which one of us kills you."
machine,Get the gun!
amy, Hello?
amy, Tom?  Where have you been... ?
welles," Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there..."
welles," I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there"
welles,"Just do it, Amy, please, go."
welles, Honey... ?
welles,I don't know if I can do that.
amy,What happened to you?
amy,"What's going on, Tom?  What happened?"
welles,"I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me..."
amy,Tom...
amy,Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
welles,I don't know.  I'm sorry...
amy,You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
amy,You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
welles,I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
amy,You couldn't?
welles,You don't understand...
amy,"No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!"
welles,I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
amy,You should have.
welles,"Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us."
amy,"Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through..."
welles,I don't know what to say
amy,You're killing me...
welles,Don't...
amy,What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
welles,Amy...
welles,Forgive me.
welles,We have to stay here a few days. I'll get more clothing from the house if I can.  I'm sorry.  We're going to be okay.
amy,Who are you calling?
welles,Mrs. Christian.
amy,What?
welles,She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
amy,Tom... she's dead.
welles,I just talked to her.
amy,How could you not know?
amy,Promise you'll stay.
welles,"Promise you won't go back there, wherever you were.  Whatever it was, forget it."
amy,Promise me.
welles,I promise.
welles,"Hello, Eddie."
welles,Put your hands on your head.
welles,"Put your hands behind your head, lock your finger together, get down on your knees."
welles,I owe you a few.
welles,Don't go anywhere.
eddie,I'm gonna kill you.
welles,Don't bore me with that bullshit.
eddie,How'd you find me here?
welles,Don't ask questions.
eddie,Fuck you!
welles,Starting to recognize a pattern?
eddie,What do you want?
welles,Who is Machine?
eddie,I don't know...
welles,I want his name.
eddie,"I told you, I don't know."
eddie,"What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows."
welles,"Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up."
eddie,"Yeah, the fucking lawyer."
welles,Told him you could get him a snuff film.
eddie,Yeah.
welles,How much did he pay you?
eddie,"Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker."
welles,That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
eddie,It was a lot of fucking money.
welles,"So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out."
eddie,Something like that.
welles,"What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?"
eddie,What the fuck do you want from me?
welles,I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
eddie,"Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!"
eddie,"You wanted to know, now you know."
eddie,"That's right, motherfucker, cut me loose.  Be a man."
welles,Show me!
welles,"Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it."
eddie,Why?
welles,Because we're going there.
eddie,What are we doing here?
eddie,I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
welles,You enjoy it?
eddie,"Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money."
welles,Tell me what happened.
eddie,"What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop..."
welles,Nobody saw you bring her in?
eddie,"There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work."
welles,What did you do with her body?
eddie,Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
welles,Show me.
eddie,What are you thinking you're gonna do... ?
welles,Keep moving.
eddie,"Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?"
eddie,"You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing..."
welles,Stop talking.
eddie,You got absolute zero.
welles,Show me where you buried her.
eddie,I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
welles,Where?  Show me where.
eddie,I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
eddie,"You'll never find her.  Nobody ever will, and even if they did, it doesn't mean nothing.  Bring in the cops, bring in the F.B.I., fuck 'em all.  Without the film, it never happened.  Don't you get it?  It's over.  You can't do anything."
welles,"I can kill you.  I can leave you out here, just like you left her."
eddie,Do it.
welles,Don't think I won't.
eddie,Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
welles,Easy enough for you.
eddie,I never killed anyone.
welles,"That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you ""felt like it.""  Almost makes you worse."
eddie,What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
eddie,Where you going?  You're the one with the gun.  Aren't I defenseless enough?  Come on...
eddie,"Go ahead and kill me.  Kill me with that gun, your gun, right, registered in your name?  Dig the hole yourself, with your bare hands, bury the body with your bullets in it.  Fucking do it!"
eddie,You pussy.
eddie,Fucking pussy!
welles," Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter..."
welles," When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true..."
welles,"She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress..."
welles,"Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead."
mrs mathews,Who is this... ?
welles,"Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her..."
welles,"They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her..."
mrs mathews,No...
welles,He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
welles,"They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her..."
welles,"They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time..."
welles,"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... there wasn't anything anyone could do..."
agent,"There you are, Mr. Welles, confirmed through to Kennedy.  Gate 32B."
agent,Mr. Welles?
agent,Gate 32B.
welles," Alright, thanks for your help."
welles," Okay, thanks anyway."
welles," He's a body-builder, stands just under six feet..."
welles," Yes, I'll hold."
welles," Christopher Higgins.  Thirty- fifteen, Thirty Fifth Street. Where?  Astoria, Queens."
welles,Hello?!  Amy?
amy,Tom?!
amy,How much forgiveness do you think I have in me?
welles,I can't talk about it yet... not yet.
welles,Why... why... ?
amy,Tom... ?
welles,"I have to tell you... I have to tell you what happened.  I have to tell you everything, but we can't tell anyone else.  No one else can ever know."
welles,You're all I've got.  You're all I've ever had.  You're the only one who can save me.
