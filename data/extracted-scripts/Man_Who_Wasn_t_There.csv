Speaker,Dialogue
frank,Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
ed,Uh-huh.
frank,How d'ya like them apples?
frank,...Ed?
ed,Huh?
frank,Russians exploded an A-bomb.
ed,Yeah.
frank, Jesus...
dave,"How ya doin', Ed?"
ed,"OK. Take your coat, Ann?"
dave,"Japs had us pinned down in Buna for something like six weeks. Well, I gotta tell ya, I thought *we* had it tough, but, Jesus, we had supply. *They* were eating grubs, nuts, thistles. When we finally up and bust off the beach we found Arnie Bragg, kid missing on recon; the Japs had *eaten* the sonofabitch, if you'll pardon the, uh... And this was a scrawny, pimply kid too, nothin' to write home about. I mean, I never would've, ya know, so what do I say, honey? When I don't like dinner, what do I say?"
dave,"...I say, Jesus, honey, Arnie Bragg-- *again*?!"
dave,...Arnie Bragg--*again*?!
dave,"...Were you in the service, Ed?"
ed,"No, Dave, I wasn't."
doris,Ed was 4F on account of his fallen arches.
dave,"Mm, that's tough."
dave,Holding down the porch area?
dave,...That's quite a wife you got there.
ed,Mm.
dave,She's a rare one.
ed,"How's business, Dave?"
dave,"Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?"
ed,"All right, I guess."
dave,"...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day."
dave,"...Say, where do you get those things anyway?"
ed,Specialty store down in Sacramento.
dave,Uh-huh.
caller,I... seven...
caller,...Bee... Four...
doris,"Watch your card, honey."
caller,I... sixteen...
caller,Gee... nine...
doris,"Jesus, bingo--BINGO!"
frank,"...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?"
ed,Uh-huh.
frank,"The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think."
ed,Uh-huh.
frank,"Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?"
ed,Yeah.
frank,"Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed..."
frank,"...My point is, this is a man who knows nothing no matter how much you tell him, so sell him the goddamn FISH, Ed."
man,"OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?"
frank,"We're just closing, friend."
man,"Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!"
frank,"Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--"
ed,"I'll take care of him, go ahead, Frank. Have a seat, mister."
frank,"...You sure, Eddie?"
ed,"Yeah, yeah--go home."
frank,"In your ear, mister."
stranger,"Oh, those fiery Mediterraneans. Say! Not so fast there, brother--"
stranger,"...Pretty good, huh? Fools even the experts. 100 percent human hair, handcrafted by Jacques of San Francisco, and I'd hate to have to tell you what I paid for it."
ed,Uh-huh.
stranger,"Yes, it's a nice rug. I'm paying for it down on the installment plan..."
stranger,"...A lot of folks live with the pate exposed. They say the dames think it's sexy. But for my money it's just not good grooming--and grooming, my friend, is probably the most important thing in business--after personality, of course..."
stranger,"...Creighton Tolliver, pleased to know ya."
ed,Ed Crane. What brings you to Santa Rosa?
creighton,"A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?"
ed,Uh--
creighton,"Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!"
ed,That right.
creighton,"It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage."
ed,Huh.
creighton,"That's right! Dry cleaning--remember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is $10,000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on..."
doris,Honey?
ed,Mm.
doris,"Shave my legs, will ya?"
doris, Gimme a drag.
doris,"...Love ya, honey."
voice,"Yeah, come in."
creighton, OK... yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.
creighton,"...Oh, I thought you were the porter... Can I help you?"
ed,"...I'm, uh, Ed."
ed,...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
creighton,"Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage."
ed,"I'm, uh, I'm--the barber."
creighton,Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
creighton,...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop?
ed,"No. I might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--"
creighton,You got the dough?!
ed,"I can get it, yeah."
creighton,"Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?"
ed,No. I--tell me--
creighton,Sure.
ed,"What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?"
creighton,"Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance."
ed,And how do we share--
creighton,"Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?"
ed,I'll have it in a week.
creighton,"Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well..."
creighton,"...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh..."
ed,Ed.
ed,...Was that a pass?
creighton, Maybe.
ed,"You're out of line, mister."
creighton,No problem!
ed,Way out of line.
creighton,Right! Strictly business.
ed,Yeah.
ed,Frank.
frank,Huh?
ed,This hair.
frank,Yeah.
ed,...You ever wonder about it?
frank,Whuddya mean?
ed,I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
frank,"Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?"
ed,"No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away."
frank,"Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid."
ed,"OK, bud, you're through."
ed,...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
frank,What the--
ed,I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
frank,What the hell are you talking about?
ed,I don't know. Skip it.
doris,Ed?
doris,...Gimme a zip.
ed,Where you going?
doris,"Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push."
ed,"Yeah, right."
doris,"Come on, get ready. It's important."
ed,"Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties."
doris,"Oh, don't be a grump."
young man,"Wild, man!"
voice,You in ladies' wear?
ed,...Huh?
young man,Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
ed,I don't work here. My wife does.
young man,"Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?"
ed,Yeah.
young man,Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
ed,Uh-huh.
dave,Ed. Can I talk to you?
dave,Siddown. Siddown...
dave,...Souveniered it off a Jap in New Guinea.
dave,...I guess you're wondering what Doris was so hot about.
dave,...These're Havanas. Romeo and Juliets. Private stock.
dave,"...Ed, I..."
ed,"What is it, Dave?"
dave,"Ed, I've been weak..."
dave,"...I've, uh... I've, uh... thanks."
dave,"...I've, uh... Oh, Jesus. I've been carrying on with a married woman. Uh, no one you know. And now the, uh-- what is it they say?--the--the--the chickens are coming home to roost."
ed,Uh-huh.
dave,"Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows."
ed,Uh-huh.
dave,"Well, you know what that would do to me."
ed,I guess it would be pretty awkward.
dave,"Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed."
ed,Uh-huh.
dave,"I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus."
ed,"How much to they want, Dave?"
dave,"$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is."
ed,...You know... who *who* is?
dave,"The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount."
ed,Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
dave,"Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious."
ed,"Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--"
dave,"He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us."
dave,...Thanks...
dave,"...Oh, Jesus."
ed,"...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?"
dave,"That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann."
ed,Mm.
dave,"Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn wife!"
dave,"...Doris, she was pretty hot about that. God bless her. She doesn't know I'm telling you this--she's mad enough already. But Jesus, Ed, you're the only one I can talk to. I'm, I'm sorry I... I better get back to the party."
dave,...I look all right?
ed,That was pretty.
ed,...Did you make that up?
young woman,"Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven."
ed,That was quite something.
young woman,He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
ed,That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
young woman,"I know who you are, Mr Crane."
young woman,...My father used to take me with him when he got his hair cut. Walter Abundas?
young woman,...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
ed,"Sorry, I just didn't remember."
birdy,"Oh, that's all right. You can't be expected to remember every skinny girl who comes in with her dad."
ed,...You don't like the music out there?
birdy,"It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily."
voice,Ed.
doris,...What a knucklehead.
ed,Who?
doris,Dave.
ed,How's that?
doris,Ahh...
doris,...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
ed,So?
doris,*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
ed,Mm.
doris,...What a knucklehead.
creighton,"Yeah, good, how are ya, come in..."
creighton,...You bring a check?
ed,Cash.
creighton,Cash?!
creighton,"...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?"
ed,Sure.
creighton,"I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?"
ed,Yeah.
creighton,"Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--"
ed,It's OK.
creighton,"Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point?"
creighton,"...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--"
ed,That'll be fine.
creighton,"Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh..."
creighton,"...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion."
ed,Uh-huh.
creighton,"Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--"
ed,"Look, uh... Creighton..."
ed,...You're not gonna screw me on this?
creighton,"*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--"
ed,All right.
creighton,"And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--"
ed,OK.
creighton,"So, uh... Tolliver's is OK then?"
doris,...I hate wops.
doris,...What's so damn strange about that?
ed,I didn't say a word.
doris,...*You* didn't have to grow up with 'em.
doris,...Family. Boy.
child,He's ridin' Garibaldi! Uncle Frankie's ridin' Garibaldi!
woman,"How you doin', Doris, you been OK?"
doris,"How're you, Constanza?"
woman,"Oh, you know, I got my healt'. And how you been, uh..."
ed,Ed.
woman,Ed. How's a business?
ed,OK.
woman," He's a barber, right? It's a good trade. So how come you got no kids?"
voices,Uncle Frankie's gotta join! Wait for Frankie!
frank,"No, come on, kids--I just ate lunch!"
voices,"No, no--Uncle Frankie's gotta join!"
old man,Ready...
old man,...Go!
doris,"'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful."
ed,"Congratulations, Gina."
doris,"Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it."
ed,Honey...
doris,"It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, I'm sure."
ed,Honey...
doris,Congratulations on your goddamn cherries!
doris,...Leggo my goddamn elbow.
frank,I never wanna see another blueberry pie...
frank,...I never even wanna hear those words.
frank,"...Don't says those words, Ed."
ed,Yeah.
voice,"Ed, it's Big Dave. I gotta talk to you."
ed,What--now?
dave,"Please, Ed."
ed,But it's...
dave,"Please, Ed."
ed,Your place?
dave,I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
ed,OK.
ed,...Honey.
ed,...Honey.
ed,...Dave?
dave,Come on in.
ed,"...What's the problem, Big Dave?"
dave,...I'm ruined.
dave,...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
ed,So you paid the guy?
dave,...What kind of man *are* you?
ed,...Huh?
dave,What kind of man *are* you?
ed,Big Dave--
dave,I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
ed,"I, uh..."
dave,I'm not proud of what I did. But *you*.
dave,"...Yeah, I paid up. As you well know. And then I went and found the pansy."
dave,"...Got nothin' to say, huh? Yeah, well, you already know the story. I didn't, I hadda beat it out of the pansy. *Your* money."
dave,...What kind of man *are* you?
dave,...Well.
dave,...I'm all shot to hell.
dave,...What kind of man *are* you?
frank,"Holy-moly, do I got a headache."
frank,"...How you today, Ed?"
ed,OK.
frank,You don't got a headache?
ed,...Nah.
frank,"Damn, I got a headache to beat the band."
frank,Ya can't pump it. Did ya pump it? That'll just flood it.
customer,Ya gotta pump it. Ya can't just hold it down. *That'll* flood it.
frank,You crazy? You pumped it?
customer,"Well, ya can't hold it down."
man 1,Ed Crane?
ed,Right.
man 1,Come on outside.
ed,Sure.
man 2,"...So you're a barber, huh?"
ed,That's right.
man 1,I'm Officer Persky. This is Krebs.
ed,...We goin'?
krebs,Huh? No.
persky,...Cigarette?
persky,Right. Uh... Pete's got some news for you.
krebs,"...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched."
persky,They sent us to tell ya.
ed,Huh?
krebs,They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
ed,My *wife*?
persky,"Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh..."
krebs,Homicide.
persky,"Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... He's the decedent."
ed,I don't understand.
krebs,He's the dead guy.
persky,"...Yeah, it's a tough break."
krebs,Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
persky,"Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya."
persky,...Crap detail.
man,"'Lo, Ed."
ed,"Hello, Walter."
walter,Have a seat.
ed,"Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home."
walter,"Oh, hell. Drink?"
ed,No thanks.
walter,Sure you don't need one?
ed,I'm fine.
walter,OK. Boy. Jesus!
ed,"Yeah. What do I, uh..."
walter,"Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless."
walter,"'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender."
ed,He a good man?
walter,"Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm..."
ed,So--
walter,Taking it seriously.
ed,"So, who should I--"
voice,"You want any coffee, Dad?"
voice,"Oh, hello, Mr Crane."
ed,"Hello, Rachel."
birdy,I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
ed,Yeah. Thanks.
walter,"Coffee, Ed?"
ed,I'm fine. Thanks.
walter,"No thanks, honey."
birdy,"OK. Nice to see you, Mr Crane."
walter,Damnit! She's a good kid.
ed,"...So, uh, who should I--"
walter,"Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here."
walter,...Probity.
ed,"Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh..."
walter,"Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money."
ed,"Uh-huh. He's the, uh..."
walter,"Yeah, the best."
walter,"...Yeah, Riedenschneider. Wish I could tell you more. Hell, I wish I could handle it myself. But I'd be absolutely worthless for this kind of thing."
walter,...Criminal matter? Freddy Riedenschneider.
walter,...No question about it.
ed,Honey... I brought your make-up.
doris,Honey.
ed,How are you?
doris,I don't know what's going on. I--
ed,What happened to you?
doris,"...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it."
ed,You don't have to--
doris,"I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that."
ed,You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
doris,I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
ed,Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
doris,Should I... should I tell you why?
ed,You don't have to tell me anything.
doris,Jesus Christ.
doris,"...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store."
ed,Honey...
doris,I knew we'd pay for it.
frank,"This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!"
ed,Yeah.
frank,Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
ed,"Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--"
frank,I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
ed,That's very generous.
frank,"The hell with it, Eddie!"
frank,"They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that."
ed,Uh-huh.
frank,"Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me."
ed,Uh-huh.
frank,"They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, how long has *this* place been here?"
man,Mr Raffo?
frank,"Yes, sir."
man,Could you come with me please?
frank,Sure. Can Ed come too?
man,Mr...?
ed,Crane. Ed Crane.
man,You also have an interest in the securing property?
frank,He's a barber.
man,Ah.
frank,Second chair.
man,Not an owner.
frank,"No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law."
man,Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
man,"...not fried, poached. Three of 'em for two minutes. A strip steak medium rare, flapjacks, potatoes, tomato juice, and plenty of hot coffee."
man,...Do you have prairie oysters?
waitress,"No, sir."
man,Then bring me a fruit cocktail while I wait.
man,...You're Ed Crane?
ed,Yeah--
man,"Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries."
ed,"No thanks, I--"
riedenschneider,"Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?"
ed,No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
riedenschneider,"Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?"
ed,...OK.
riedenschneider,Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No?
riedenschneider,"...You're OK, pal. You're OK, she's OK. Everything's gonna be hunky-dory."
riedenschneider,"...And the flapjacks, honey."
ed,Ann.
ann,"Hello, Ed."
ed,Ann. Will you come in?
ann,"...No, No, it's very late."
ed,...I'm so sorry about your loss.
ann,Yes. Thank you.
ed,"Of course, you know, Doris had nothing to do with it. Nothing at all."
ann,"Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you..."
ed,"Yes, Ann?"
ann,And you should tell Doris...
ann,...You know how Big Dave loved camping. And the out-of-doors.
ed,Yes?
ann,"We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed."
ed,...Yes?
ann,"At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report."
ed,Ann--
ann,"A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else."
ed,Ann--
ann,"The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--"
ed,"Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?"
ann,"Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again."
ann,"...Tell Doris not to worry. I know it wasn't her. Perhaps this will bring it out, finally. Perhaps now it will all come out."
riedenschneider,...It stinks.
doris,But it's true.
riedenschneider,"I don't care it's true, it's not true; it stinks. You say he was being blackmailed; by who? You don't know. For having an affair; with who? You don't know. Did anyone else know about it? Probably not; you don't know."
ed,"I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money."
riedenschneider,Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
riedenschneider,"...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--"
ed,It was Big Dave's.
riedenschneider,"--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone."
ed,*I* was with her.
riedenschneider,"...Like I say, it stinks."
ed,...I killed him.
riedenschneider,"OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?"
ed,He and Doris... were having an affair.
riedenschneider,"OK, how did you know?"
ed,I... just knew. A husband knows.
riedenschneider,Will anyone else say they knew?
ed,I don't know. I don't think so.
riedenschneider,How did you get into the store?
ed,I took Doris's keys.
riedenschneider,Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
ed,...I don't think so.
riedenschneider,Will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all?
riedenschneider,"...Come on, people. You can't help each other like that. Let's be realistic now. Let's look at our options. Well, frankly, I don't *see* any options."
riedenschneider,...I cannot present Story A.
riedenschneider,"...I cannot present Story B. I could plead you for a nutcase but you look too composed. I could offer a guilty plea and in return they don't give you the juice, but I don't think you want to spend the rest of your life in Chino and I know you didn't hire Freddy Riedenschneider to hold your hand at a sentencing hearing. Hell, you could've gotten Lloyd Garroway for that. No, we're not giving up yet; you hired Freddy Riedenschneider, it means you're *not* throwing in the towel. I litigate, I don't capitulate. All right, no options, we gotta think. All right, we go back to the blackmail thing. It titillates, it's open ended..."
riedenschneider,"...And it makes *him* the bad guy-- ya dig around, ya never know, something unsavory from his past, he approaches you to help with the money, it's too late, his past comes back to haunt him, who's to say..."
riedenschneider,"...Yeah. OK. Forget the jealous husband thing, that's silly; we're going with the blackmail. I'll be in touch."
customer,"She makes this stuff, she calls it gatto, it's got egg in there, it's got sugar, it's got--it's cake, basically, except she calls it gatto. Like if you don't call it cake maybe you won't put on any weight, like I need to eat gatto, you know what I'm saying? This stuff, if I've had a square meal, I've had my steak and potatoes, I can just have another cup of coffee afterward, I won't ask for the desert if it's not there..."
customer,"Got the recipe from a magazine, woman's magazine..."
bailiff,"...did willfully and with malice aforethought take the life of one David Allen Brewster, a human being..."
bailiff,What say you to these charges?
riedenschneider,"We plead not guilty, your honor."
customer,"I say, Honey, if you're gonna make a cobbler, make a little bit of cobbler, don't put a whole pan in front of me and tell me it's not gonna be any good when it's cold..."
ed,"'Lo, honey."
riedenschneider,"...They got this guy, in Germany. Fritz something-or-other. Or is it. Maybe it's Werner. Anyway, he's got this theory, you wanna test something, you know, scientifically--how the planets  go round the sun, what sunspots are made of, why the water comes out of the tap--well, you gotta look at it. But sometimes, you look at it, your looking *changes* it. Ya can't know the reality of what happened, or what *would've* happened if you hadden a stuck in your goddamn schnozz. So there *is* no 'what happened.' Not in any sense that we can grasp with our puny minds. Because our minds... out minds get in the way. Looking at something changes it. They call it the 'Uncertainty Principle.' Sure, it sounds screwy, but even Einstein says the guy's on to something."
riedenschneider,...Science. Perception. Reality. Doubt...
riedenschneider,"...Reasonable doubt. I'm sayin', sometimes, the more you look, the less you really know. It's a fact. A proved fact. In a way, it's the only fact there is. This heinie even wrote it out in numbers."
riedenschneider,...Burns?
burns,"Subject: David Allen Brewster. Born: Cincinnati, 1911. Father: insurance salesman; mother: homemaker. One year Case Western University on football scholarship. Flunks out. 1931: retail appliance salesman in Barnhoff's department store, Cincinnati. 1933: meets Ann Nirdlinger, married later that year, moves here. 1935: arrested on an assault complaint; complainant, an organizer for the ILGWU, has a broken nose, couple of ribs, wife's family intercedes, some kind of settlement, charges dropped. 1936: another assault beef, bar altercation--"
riedenschneider,"Yeah, yeah, couple of fistfights. Go to his service record."
burns,"...Inducted March 15, 1942, assigned to fifth fleet US Navy, petty officer first class, serves in clerical capacity in US naval shipyards in San Diego, one fistfight broken up by MPs, no court martial, honorable discharge May 8, 1945. Since then he's been clean."
riedenschneider,"...Thank you, Burns, get lost."
ed,...So?
riedenschneider,"So? *So?!* This could be your dolly's ticket out of the deathhouse, so!"
ed,...I don't get it.
riedenschneider,"Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth."
ed,Yeah.
riedenschneider,"And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money..."
riedenschneider,"...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!"
ed,So... who... who actually--
riedenschneider,"Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier *not* to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. *You* explain it to me. Go ahead. Try."
riedenschneider,"...Yeah, Freddy Riedenschneider sees daylight. We got a real shot at this, folks. Let's not get cocky."
ed,Honey...?
ed,...Honey?
doris,What a dope.
birdy,He was deaf when he wrote this.
ed,Who?
birdy,"Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow."
birdy,"Hi, Mr Crane."
ed,"Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good."
birdy,"Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane."
ed,"Hello, Tony."
tony,"Hello, sir."
ed,"...Well, congratulations. I guess I'll be getting home."
tony,"Nice to meet you, sir."
frank,Where's the judge? How come there's no judge?
frank,"...Where's the judge, Ed?"
frank,...How come the judge doesn't come out?
riedenschneider,The judge comes in last. He'll come in when Doris gets here.
frank,"So where's Doris? I thought we started at ten. Hey, Riedenschneider, where's Doris?"
riedenschneider,She's late.
frank,Late? How can she be late?
frank,"...She's in prison, Ed. None of *us* are in prison, and yet we're not late. We're on time, Ed. How can Doris be late? What, they don't have wake-up calls?"
judge,Counselors.
frank,"What's going on, Ed? I thought there would be arguments. The bailiff, and so forth..."
frank,"...Ed, what is this? Is this procedure?"
judge,Bailiff.
riedenschneider,I don't understand... We had a real shot at it... We could have won this thing...
bailiff,"In the matter of the State of California versus Doris Crane, Case Number 87249 assigned to this Superior Court..."
riedenschneider,...It doesn't make any sense...
voice 1,"So two blocks later I look at the change she gave me and, golly, I'm two bits short."
voice 2,Two bits short.
voice 1,"So I walk back over to Linton's, find this gal--big argument; she doesn't even recall the transaction."
voice 2,No recollection.
voice 1,"Doesn't recall the transaction, no recollection, so I said, Look, dear..."
new man,"...go ahead, look at the menu, if you're in before six o'clock it's the, whatchamacallit, the--"
customer,Early Bird Special.
new man,"What? Yeah, the Early Riser..."
voice,Crane?
ed,...I'm Crane.
man,My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
ed,Yeah?
diedrickson,Just came for an informal chat...
diedrickson,...Why don't I buy you a drink?
ed,"Dwight, you OK here for a few minutes?"
dwight,"Whuh--uh, yeah, sure Ed, take your time."
diedrickson,Rye.
ed,Just coffee.
diedrickson,You sure you don't want something stiffer?
bartender,Coffee it is.
diedrickson,...County M. E. does an autopsy on anyone who dies in custody. I don't know if you knew that. It's routine.
diedrickson,"...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told."
ed,Told what?
diedrickson,"I, uh... thanks."
diedrickson,"...I'm sorry to add to your burden, Crane, but I'd want to know it it was me. Your wife was pregnant. First trimester."
diedrickson,"...Well, there it is."
diedrickson,...I'm sorry.
diedrickson,"...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing."
ed,My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
diedrickson," ...Well, that's not really my business."
diedrickson,"...I'm sorry. Well, there it is."
diedrickson,"...Good luck, Crane."
woman,Giff me your hant.
walter,"Ed, how're you holding up?"
ed,"I'm OK, Walter, thanks."
walter,I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
ed,Yeah.
walter,Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
ed,"Sure, Walter. Thanks."
birdy,"Hello, Mr Crane."
ed,"Hello, Birdy."
birdy,We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry.
ed,Yeah.
birdy,We've certainly missed you.
ed,"Birdy, I've been doing a lot of thinking. There are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. Life has dealt me some bum cards..."
ed,"...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--"
birdy,Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
ed,Oh. Sorry.
birdy,Sometimes I have a cigarette in here when he's away. Never when he's in the house. He can smell it a mile off.
ed,"Sure... Sure, it's his house."
birdy,That's what he keeps telling me.
ed,"Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away."
birdy,"Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school."
ed,"That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman."
birdy,Boy.
ed,"You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--"
birdy,"Oh, Mr Crane--"
ed,"I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand."
birdy,"Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff."
ed,"I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words."
birdy,"Geez, Mr Crane."
ed,"Just see him, as a favor to me."
carcanogues,...You are ze fahzer?
ed,No. Uh... family friend.
man,I am Carcanogues.
man,"...You wait, my dear?"
birdy,"Sure, Mr K."
carcanogues,"I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?"
ed,Uh-huh.
carcanogues,"Ah yes, a music lover."
ed,"Well, I don't pretend to be an expert."
carcanogues,Ah.
carcanogues,...Ah-hah.
carcanogues,...Mm.
ed,Well? How'd she do?
carcanogues,"Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks."
ed,I don't understand.
carcanogues,"Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite."
ed,Did she make mistakes?
carcanogues,"Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper."
ed,"I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--"
carcanogues,"Ah, but that is just what I cannot teach. I cannot teach her to have a soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. *Done* with the fingers, yes. But the music, she is inside. Inside, monsieur..."
carcanogues,...The music start here...
carcanogues,"...come out through here; then, maybe..."
carcanogues,...she can go up there.
ed,"Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--"
carcanogues,"Then you listen to me, for I am expert. That girl, she give me a headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, I think, maybe, she make a very good typist."
birdy,"...I stank, didn't I?"
ed,He didn't say that.
birdy,But more or less.
ed,"Look, I'm no expert, but--"
birdy,"It doesn't matter, Mr Crane."
ed,I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
birdy,"But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally."
birdy,"...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian."
ed,...Uh-huh.
birdy,"I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though."
ed,Ah... it's nothing.
birdy,I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
ed,Huh.
birdy,You're an enthusiast.
ed,Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
ed,...I guess I've been all wet.
birdy,"But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane..."
birdy,...I wanted to make you happy.
ed,Birdy--
birdy,It's OK...
birdy,"...I want to do it, Mr Crane."
ed,Birdy!
ed,"...No, please."
birdy,"Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--"
man,Hello!
ed,Hello.
man,I notice you still have peastone in your driveway.
man,"Well, of course, you don't have to rejuvenate that once every couple of years, don't you, when the peastone thins out."
man,"...Where does it go, huh? Like the odd sock. But you *know* where it goes--you probably pick pieces of it off your lawn all the time, churn it up with your lawn mower, sweep it off the walk here--pain in the neck."
ed,Doesn't bother me.
man,"Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth..."
man,"...but we have the technology now to bring it to the homeowner, the individual consumer, at a very reasonable price."
man,"...Mind if I show you the specifications?--Evening, ma'am."
doris,What're *you* selling?
man,"Well, ma'am, I was just telling your husband here about tar Macadam, for your home driveway here--these are the specs..."
man,...It's the modern way to--
doris,Get lost.
ed,...Doris--
doris,"Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright."
voice,Are you there? Are you awake?
doctor,"He's coming around. Can you talk, sir? These men have to talk."
doctor,...Sir? Are you awake? He's awake.
persky,Are you awake?... Is he awake?
krebs,"Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?"
persky,His eyes are open.
krebs,Uh... you're under arrest.
persky,"As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?"
krebs,You'll go to the prison hospital.
persky,Under arrest for murder.
ed,Birdy... I didn't mean to--
krebs,What'd he say?
ed,Birdy...
doctor,"Birdy. The girl. No, the girl's OK. Broken clavicle."
doctor,"...That's the collarbone, Crane. Broken. She's OK though."
krebs,So he understands? He's under arrest for murder?
ed,Big Dave.
persky,Huh?
krebs,What'd he say? Does he understand?
persky,He said OK. Is that what he said?
krebs,You're under arrest for the murder of Creighton Tolliver! Do you understand?
persky,...Does he understand?...
riedenschneider,"Not guilty, your honor..."
district attorney,...cynically used his own wife as a cat's paw in a scheme of diabolical cunning...
riedenschneider,...a puny player on the great world's stage...
riedenschneider,...who among us is in a position to say...
frank,What kind of man *are* you? What kind of man *are* you?
riedenschneider,"Move for a mistrial, your honor! Move for a mistrial! This outrageous display cannot help but prejudice..."
riedenschneider,...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
garroway,"Your honor, we plead guilty, with extenuating circumstances."
