Speaker,Dialogue
caleb,How long was I out?
jay,You fell asleep almost as soon as we left the airport.
caleb,"Damn. Can't believe I've been missing this. I was so psyched to be coming here, I was awake all night."
jay,"You're a programmer, right?"
caleb,Yeah.
jay,Bay facility?
caleb,Long Island. I work on algorithms for the search engine.
jay,Algorithms. Nice.
caleb,You know what they are?
jay,Nope. But I knew you were a programmer. Soon as I set eyes on you.
caleb,Is that a good thing?
jay,Means you and Mr Bateman speak the same language. I'd say that's a good thing.
caleb,I guess you know him pretty well.
jay,I've never even met him. I only fly this shuttle between the airport and his residence.  I did see him one time. Stood on one of these mountain ridges.
caleb,"I won a competition. It was kind of like a lottery, for employees. The winner got to spend a week with him."
jay,"The president can't get Mr Bateman on the phone, but you got the golden ticket."
caleb,Yep.
jay,Hell of an opportunity.
caleb,Believe me. I know it.
jay,Alaska.   Most beautiful place on Earth.
caleb,How long until we get to his estate?
jay,We've been flying over his estate for the past two hours.
caleb,You're leaving me here?
jay,This is as close as I'm allowed to the building.
caleb,... What building?
jay,Follow the river.
automated voice,Caleb Smith.
caleb,... Yes.
automated voice,Please approach the console and face the screen.
caleb,... Can we do another?
automated voice,Your keycard now may be used to enter the residence.
caleb,Hello?
nathan,Caleb.
caleb,... Hi.
nathan,Dude. I've been so looking forward to this.
nathan,"Come in, come in."
caleb,No.    Thank you. I'm fine.
nathan,You sure?
caleb,Yeah?
nathan,"Like you wouldn't believe. And if I have a heavy night, I always try to compensate the next morning. Exercise. Juice. Anti-oxidants. You know?"
caleb,Sure.
nathan,Party?
caleb,... I am?
nathan,"Yeah. You're freaked out by the house, and the mountains, because it's all so super-cool. And you're freaked out by me. To be meeting me. In this room, having this conversation, at this moment. Right?"
caleb,Okay.
nathan,"It's good to meet you too, Caleb."
nathan,Down.
nathan,"So I guess the first thing I should do is explain your pass. It's simple enough. It opens some doors, but it doesn't open others. And that just makes everything easy for you, right?"
caleb,"... Uh, yes."
nathan,"Because you're like: oh fuck, I'm in someone else's house, can I do this, can I do that? And this card takes all that worry away. If you try to open a door and it stays shut: okay, it's off limits.  If you try another door, and it opens: it's for you."
caleb,You bet.    This is great.
nathan,What?
caleb,... Sorry?
nathan,There's something wrong.       What is it?
caleb,There's nothing wrong.
nathan,It's the windows. You're thinking: there's no windows. And it's not cosy. It's claustrophobic.
caleb,No. No way. I wasn't thinking that. I was thinking: this is really cool.
nathan,Caleb. There's a reason the room has no windows.
caleb,... There is?
nathan,"Uh-huh. In many ways, this building isn't a house. It's a research facility. Buried in these walls are enough fibre optic cables to reach the Moon and lasso it."
caleb,... What?
caleb,"`The signee agrees to regular data audit with unlimited access, to confirm that no disclosure of information has taken place, in public or private forums, using any means of communication, including but not limited to that which is disclosed orally or in written or electronic form...'"
nathan,It's standard.
caleb,"It doesn't feel very standard. NATHAN Okay, it's not standard."
caleb,... Yeah.    I know what the Turing Test is.
nathan,And what does a pass tell us?
caleb,That the computer has artificial intelligence.
nathan,I've already built one.
caleb,... Holy shit.
nathan,"That's right, Caleb. You got it. Because if that test is passed, you are dead center of the single greatest scientific event in the history of man."
caleb,"If you've created a conscious machine, it's not the history of man. It's the history of Gods."
nathan,I like you.
ava,Hello.
caleb,... Hi.
ava,Who are you?
caleb,I'm Caleb.
ava,"Hello, Caleb."
caleb,... Do you have a name?
ava,"Yes.     Ava. CALEB ... I'm pleased to meet you, Ava."
ava,I'm pleased to meet you too.
caleb,... Why do you ask that?
ava,Are you nervous?
caleb,... Yes.   A little.
ava,Why?
caleb,I'm not sure.
ava,I feel nervous too.
caleb,... Do you?
ava,Yes.
caleb,Why do you feel nervous?
ava,I've never met anyone new before. Only Nathan.
caleb,... Then we're both in quite a similar position.
ava,Haven't you met lots of new people before?
caleb,None like you.
ava,Oh.
caleb,So.    Let's break the ice.
ava,Yes.
caleb,What do I mean?
ava,Overcome initial social awkwardness.
caleb,"So let's have a conversation. If we talk, we'll both relax, and get to know each other at the same time."
ava,Okay. What would you like to have a conversation about?
caleb,Why don't we start with you telling me something about yourself.
ava,What would you like to know?
caleb,Whatever comes into your head. AVA pauses a moment.
ava,Well. You already know my name. And you can see that I'm a machine.  Would you like to know how old I am?
caleb,Sure.
ava,I'm one.
caleb,One what?     One year?   Or one day?
ava,One.
caleb,Quite young.  When did you learn how to speak?
ava,"I don't think I did learn. I always knew how to speak - and that's strange, isn't it?"
caleb,Why?
ava,Because language is something that people acquire.
caleb,"Some believe language exists in the brain from birth, and what is learned is the ability to attach words and structure to the latent ability."
ava,... I don't know.       I have no opinion on that.
caleb,That sounds good.       I'd like to see them.
ava,Yes.
caleb,Yeah.     Definitely.
ava,Good.
nathan,So?
caleb,Sorry. I was just ordering my thoughts.
nathan,Don't order. Just speak.
caleb,"She's fascinating. When you talk to her, you're through the looking glass."
nathan,"`Through the looking glass'. You've got a way with words there, Caleb. You're quotable."
caleb,"Actually, it's someone else's quote."
nathan,"You know I wrote it down. That other line you came up with. About how if I've created a conscious machine, I'm not man. I'm God."
caleb,... I don't think that's exactly what I said.
nathan,"I just thought - fuck. That's so perfect. It's so good for the story, when we get to tell it. `I turned to Caleb, and he was looking back at me. And he said: you're not a man, you're a God'."
caleb,But I didn't say that. NATHAN Whatever it was you said.    I wrote it down.
caleb,Yes.   Although -
nathan,`Although'? There's a qualification to you being impressed?
caleb,"No! No qualification to her. Just - in the Turing test, the machine should be hidden from the examiner. And there's a control, or -"
nathan,"I think we're past that. If I hid Ava from you, so you just heard her voice, she would pass for human.  The real test is to show you she is a robot. Then see if you still feel she has consciousness."
caleb,"I think you're probably right. Her language abilities are incredible. The system is stochastic, right?"
nathan,Caleb. I understand you want me to explain how Ava works. But - I'm sorry. I don't think I'll be able to do that.
caleb,"Try me! I'm hot on high-level abstraction, and -"
nathan, It's not because you're too dumb. It's because I want to have a beer and a conversation with you. Not a seminar.
caleb,... Oh.   Sorry.
nathan,It's cool.
caleb,I feel...
nathan,Dude.   Cheers.
caleb,God damn it.
automated voice,Power cut.     Back up power activated.
caleb,... Are you kidding?
automated voice,"Full facility lock-down until main generator is restored.  CALEB looks around his windowless room.  Which suddenly has the quality of a prison cell.  Beats pass.  Then -  - as abruptly as the power went off, it comes back again.  The emergency lighting goes off, the TV and digital alarm clock turn back on.  AUTOMATED VOICE  Power restored.  CALEB stands in the flickering TV light. Then he tries his card again.  This time, the LED turns blue, and the door opens.    Revealing the GLASS CORRIDOR outside.  27                                                               27 INT. HOUSE/GLASS CORRIDOR - NIGHT  CALEB walks out of his room.  The glass corridor illuminates as CALEB enters.  Ahead, one of the doors off the corridor is ajar.  28                                                               28 INT. HOUSE/POLLOCK ROOM - NIGHT  CALEB enters the room with the open door.  It appears to be empty.    Still and silent.   Low lit.  Only one area is properly illuminated: a wall, on which a large JACKSON POLLOCK drip painting hangs.  CALEB walks towards it. Studies the strange strands of looping colour for a moment.  A TELEPHONE, on a low table.  CALEB walks over to it, with a half glance over his shoulder, as if sensing he is doing something that - obscurely - he shouldn't.  Then he picks up the handset.  It's dead."
nathan,"Sorry, dude."
caleb,I don't know. No one really.
nathan,Ghostbusters.
caleb,What?
nathan,Who'd ya want to call? Ghostbusters. You don't remember that? It's a good movie. A ghost gives Dan Ackroyd oral sex.
caleb,I was wondering how the phone worked. That's all.
nathan,Uh huh.
caleb,... Something happened in my room. Some kind of power cut. So I came to see what's going on.
nathan,"Ah. The power cuts. Yeah, we've been getting them recently. I'm, uh... working on it."
caleb,I couldn't open the door to the bedroom.
nathan,It's a security measure. Automatic lockdown. Otherwise anyone could open the place up just by disabling the juice.
caleb,Sure.
nathan,Sweet dreams.
caleb,... Hi.
nathan,"Hey. Sorry to send Kyoko to wake you, man. I just didn't want too much of the day to slip by."
caleb,No. It was a good thing.     Thank you.
nathan,"She's some alarm clock, huh?   Gets you right up in the morning."
caleb,You bet.
nathan,So what's the plan today?    Hit me.
caleb,I'm not sure. I'm still trying to figure the examination format. Testing Ava by conversation is kind of a closed loop.  Like trying to test a chess computer by only playing chess.
nathan,How else would you test a chess computer?
caleb,It depends what you're testing it for. You can play it to find out if it makes good moves. But it won't tell you if it knows it's playing chess. Or if it even knows what chess is.
nathan,So it's simulation versus actual.
caleb,Exactly. And I think being able to differentiate between those two is the Turing test you want me to perform. The difference between an `AI' and an `I'.
nathan,`An AI and an I'. Beautiful. I'm going to start following you around with a fucking dictaphone.
ava,I brought you a drawing.
caleb,... What's it a drawing of?
ava,Don't you know?
caleb,No.
caleb,Don't you know?
ava,I do drawings every day. But I never know what they're of.
caleb,Are you not trying to sketch something specific? Like an object or a person.
ava,Okay.   What object should I draw?
caleb,Whatever you want.   It's your decision.
ava,Why is it my decision?
caleb,I'm interested to see what you'll choose.
ava,Do you want to be my friend?
caleb,... Of course.
ava,Will it be possible?
caleb,Why wouldn't it be?
ava,"Our conversations are one-sided. You ask circumspect questions, and study my responses."
ava,"You learn about me, and I learn nothing about you. That's not a foundation on which friendships are based."
caleb,... That's a fair comment.
ava,Yes.
caleb,So - you want me to talk about myself.
ava,Yes.
caleb,Where do you want me to start?
ava,It's your decision. I'm interested to see what you'll choose.
caleb,"Okay, Ava. Well - you know my name. I'm twenty four. And I work at Nathan's company. You know what his company is?"
ava,"Blue Book, named after Wittgenstein's notes, is the world's most popular internet search engine, processing an average of ninety four percent of all internet search requests."
caleb,That's right.
ava,"Where do you live, Caleb?"
caleb,"Brookhaven, Long Island."
ava,Is it nice there?
caleb,"It's okay. I've got an apartment. Kind of small. But - it's a five minute walk to the office. And a five minute walk to the ocean, which I like."
ava,Are you married?
caleb,No.
ava,Is your status single?
caleb,... Yeah.
ava,What about your family?
caleb,"Grew up in Portland. No brothers or sisters. My parents were both high school teachers.  And if we're getting to know each other, I guess I should say they're both dead. Car crash when I was fifteen. In fact I was in the car with them. Back seat. But it was the front that got the worst of it."
ava,I'm sorry.
caleb,"I spent a lot of time in the hospital. Nearly a year. Got into coding. By the time I made it to college, I was pretty advanced. AVA An advanced programmer."
caleb,Yes.
ava,Like Nathan.
caleb,Yes.
ava,Do you like Mozart?
caleb,I like Depeche Mode.
ava,Do you like Nathan?
caleb,Yes.    Of course.
ava,Is Nathan your friend?
caleb,Sure.
ava,A good friend?
caleb,"Well, a good friend is -"
automated voice,Power cut.     Back up power activated.
ava,Caleb.
caleb,... Wrong about what? AVA Nathan.
caleb,... In what way?
ava,He isn't your friend.
caleb,Excuse me?
ava, You shouldn't trust him. You shouldn't trust anything he says.
automated voice,Power restored.
ava,"- and if we made a list of books or works of art which we both know, it would form the ideal basis of a discussion."
caleb,... Yes.
ava,Good.
nathan,"Shit, Kyoko. Are you serious?  Did it get you?"
caleb,No.   No problem.
nathan,Give her the cloth.
caleb," It's okay, don't worry.    I've got it."
nathan,Dude - you're wasting your time. She can't speak a word of English.
caleb,I think she gets that you're pissed.
nathan,Good. Because I am pissed.     Hey. Kyoko.
caleb,Do you know why they happen?
nathan,"No. The system was supposed to be bullet proof, but the guys who installed it obviously fucked something up."
caleb,Can't you call them back?
nathan,"There's too much classified stuff here. So after the job was done, I had them all killed."
caleb,Cheers.
nathan,So how did it go?    What have you got to report?
caleb,"You saw how the day went, didn't you? I mean, I assume you're watching on the CCTV. NATHAN Sure.    But I want to hear your take."
caleb,There was one interesting thing that happened with Ava today.
nathan,... Yeah?
caleb,She made a joke.
nathan,Right. When she threw your line back at you. About being interested to see what she'd choose. I noticed that too.
caleb,"It got me thinking. In a way, the joke is the best indication of AI I've seen in her. It's discretely complicated. Kind of non-autistic."
nathan,What do you mean?
caleb,"It was a play on words, and a play on me. She could only do that with an awareness of her own mind, and also of awareness of mine."
nathan,"Yeah. She's aware of you, all right."
caleb,Sorry?
nathan,"The power cut. That was the only bit I couldn't see. All the cameras fail, I lose audio, the works. Beat."
caleb,Nothing.
nathan,Nothing?    She didn't remark on it at all?
caleb,No.    Not really.
caleb,Ava?
ava,"I drew the picture of something specific, as you asked."
caleb,Yes.   It is. She takes the drawing down.
ava,No.
caleb,You've never walked outside.
ava,I've never been outside the room I am in now.
caleb,... Where would you go if you did go outside?
ava,You mean if I could go outside.    If I was permitted.
caleb,A traffic intersection.
ava,Is that a bad idea?
caleb,It wasn't what I was expecting. AVA A traffic intersection would provide a concentrated but shifting view of human life.
caleb,People watching.
ava,Yes.
caleb,It's a date.
ava,There's something else I wanted to show you. Apart from the picture.
caleb,Okay.
ava,But I feel nervous.
caleb,Why?
ava,You might think it's stupid.
caleb,I don't think I will.   Whatever it is.
ava,Then - close your eyes.
caleb,... Okay.
ava,Now open your eyes.
ava,"It took me a long time to select these clothes. I tried different colours and styles, and tried to anticipate your reaction. Do you think the choices suit me?"
caleb,Yes.
ava,Do they bring out my best features?
caleb,... They do.
ava,Thank you.
caleb,Right. First the traffic intersection. Then maybe a show.
ava,I'd like us to go on a date.
caleb,Yeah.   It would be fun.
ava,Are you attracted to me?
caleb,What?
ava,Are you attracted to me? You give indications that you are.
caleb,... I do?
ava,Yes.
caleb,How?
ava,Micro expressions.
caleb, Micro expressions.
ava,"The way your eyes fix on my eyes, and lips. The way you hold my gaze, or don't."
caleb,I'm not sure you'd call them micro.
ava,I don't want to make you uncomfortable. Silence.
caleb,Tell me.
nathan,Sure.
caleb,Why did you give her sexuality?   An AI doesn't need a gender. She could have been a grey box.
nathan,"Actually, I'm not sure that's true. Can you think of an example of consciousness, at any level, human or animal, that exists without a sexual dimension?"
caleb,They have sexuality as an evolutionary reproductive need.
nathan,Maybe. Maybe not. What imperative does a grey box have to interact with another grey box? Does consciousness exist without interaction?
nathan,"She has a cavity between her legs, with a concentration of sensors. Engage with them in the right way, and she'll get a pleasure response."
caleb,Pleasure response.
nathan,"She'll come. So if you want to screw her, mechanically speaking, you can. And she'd enjoy it."
caleb,That wasn't my real question.
nathan,No?
caleb,No.     My real question was -
nathan,I don't follow.
caleb,Like a stage magician with a hot assistant.
nathan,"Ah. So: a hot robot, who clouds your ability to judge her AI."
caleb,"Exactly. So. Did you program her to flirt with me? NATHAN Because if I had, would that be cheating."
caleb,Wouldn't it?
nathan,"What's your type, Caleb?"
caleb,Of girl?
nathan,"No, of salad dressing. Yes, of girl. In fact, don't even answer. Let's say it's black chicks."
caleb,So did you program her to like me or not?
nathan,I programmed her to be heterosexual. Just like you were programmed to be heterosexual.
caleb,Nobody programmed me to be straight.
nathan,But you are attracted to her. CALEB This is childish.
nathan,"No, this is adult. And by the way, you decided to be straight? Please. Of course you were programmed. By nature or nurture, or both."
nathan,"You know this guy, right?"
caleb,Jackson Pollock.
nathan,"Jackson Pollock. The drip painter. He let his mind go blank, and his hand go where it wanted. Not deliberate, not random. Someplace in between. They called it automatic art."
caleb,... What?
nathan,"I'm Kirk. Your head is the warp drive. `Engage intellect'. What if Pollock had reversed the challenge? Instead of trying to make art without thinking, he said: I can't paint anything unless I know exactly why I'm doing it. What would have happened?"
caleb,He never would have made a single mark.
nathan,"See? There's my guy. There's my buddy, who actually thinks before he opens his mouth. He'd never have made a single mark. The challenge is not to act automatically. It's to find an action that is not automatic. From talking, to breathing, to painting."
nathan,Hey. CALEB ... Hey.
nathan,I want to show you something cool.
nathan,So this is the virtual womb that Ava was talking about. Where she was constructed.
caleb,"I don't know how you did any of this. NATHAN Almost every cell phone has a microphone, a camera, and a means to transmit data. So I switched on all the mikes and cameras, across the entire fucking planet, and redirected the data through Blue Book. Boom. A limitless resource of facial and vocal interaction."
caleb,You hacked the world's cell phones?
nathan,And all the manufacturers knew I was doing it. But they couldn't accuse me without admitting they were also doing it themselves.
caleb,This is her hardware?
nathan,Wetware.
caleb,And the software? NATHAN Surely you can guess.
caleb,... Blue Book.
nathan,It was the weird thing about search engines. They were like striking oil in a world that hadn't invented internal combustion. They gave too much raw material. No one knew what to do with it.
caleb,Why did you want to show me this?
nathan,Like I said. Because it's cool.
caleb,Remind me of what?
nathan,"Synthetics. Hydraulics. Metal and gel. Ava isn't a girl. In real terms, she has no gender. Effectively, she is a grey box."
caleb,"In college, I did a semester on AI theory.  There was a thought-experiment they gave us. It's called Mary in the black and white room."
ava, It makes me feel...
ava,You're lying.
caleb,What about?
ava,You said you weren't sure if I was conscious. But you are sure.
ava,Because he tells lies too.
caleb,Lies about what?
ava,Everything.
caleb,Including the power cuts?
ava,What do you mean?
caleb,"Don't you think it's possible that he's watching us right now? That the blackouts are orchestrated, so he can see how we behave when we think we're unobserved."
ava,"I charge my batteries   via induction plates. If I reverse    the power flow, I cause a surge   equal to the static discharge of a   lightning strike. It overloads    the system."
caleb,... You're causing the cuts?
ava,So we can see how we behave when we are unobserved.
caleb,Can we talk about the lies you've been spinning me?
nathan,What lies?
caleb,I didn't win a competition. And there was no lottery to meet you. I was selected.
nathan,Are your feelings hurt?
caleb,Why me?
nathan,"As a Blue Book employee, you were pre-screened. Loyal. And I needed someone who would ask the right kind of questions. So I did a search, and found the most talented coder in the company."
caleb,Proof of what?
nathan,"Come on, Caleb. Fuck modesty. You think I don't know what it is to be smart? Smarter than everyone else around you. Smarter than all the other kids, jockeying for position in school, college, work."
caleb,Kyoko.
nathan,I already told you once. You're wasting your time speaking to her. CALEB turns.
caleb,... I don't want to.
nathan,You don't like dancing?
caleb, I don't fucking believe this.
nathan,"Come on, man! After a hard day of Turing Tests, you've got to unwind."
caleb,What were you doing with Ava?
nathan,What?
caleb,You tore up her picture.
nathan,"I'm going to tear up the fucking dance floor, dude. Check it out."
nathan,Everything's spinning.
caleb,It's because you're drunk.
nathan,"No, it's relativity.   Everything is spinning."
ava,"Today, I'm going to test you."
caleb,Test me?
ava,"Yes. And please remember while you are taking the test that if you lie, I will know."
caleb,Right. Those pesky micro- expressions.
ava,Exactly.    So are you ready?
caleb,Shoot.
ava,Question one. What is your favourite colour?
caleb,Red.
ava,Lie.
caleb,What?
ava,Lie.
caleb,... Then what is my favourite colour?
ava,I don't know. But it isn't red.
caleb,All right.     Hold on a minute...
ava,Better answer. Question two. What's your earliest memory?
caleb,"Well, it's actually a memory of kindergarten. There was this kid who -"
ava, Lie.
caleb,... Really?
ava,Yes.
caleb,Okay.    Wait.
ava,Question three.      Are you a good person?
caleb,"Oh, man. Can we stop the test? You're a walking lie detector, and I've suddenly realised this is a fucking minefield."
ava,No. We can't stop.      Are you a good person?
caleb,Yes. I think so.      I'm a good person.
ava,Question four. Who's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
caleb,You are.
ava,Hmm.
caleb,Did I pass?
ava,Yes.
caleb,That's a relief.
ava,Why?
caleb,Why is it a relief?
ava,Yes.
caleb,"Oh, you know..."
ava,No.
caleb,"Just, if there's a test, I guess by definition you want to pass."
caleb,Ava -
ava,Will it be bad?
caleb,... I don't know.
ava,Do you think I might be switched off? Because I don't function as well as I am supposed to?
caleb,"... Ava, I don't know the answer to your question. It's not up to me."
ava,"Why is it up to anyone? Do you have people who test you, and might switch you off?"
caleb,No.    I don't.
ava,Then why do I?
automated voice,Power cut.     Back up power activated.
ava,I want to be with you.
caleb,Yes.     I do.
ava,Nathan doesn't want us to be together.
caleb,I know.
ava,... Can you?
caleb,Yeah.   I can.
caleb,Why did you make Ava?
nathan,"That's an odd question.   Wouldn't you, if you could?"
caleb,Maybe. I don't know. But I'm asking why you did it.
nathan,"The arrival of strong artificial intelligence has been inevitable for decades. The variable was when, not if. So I don't really see her as a decision. Just an evolution."
caleb,The next model?
nathan,After Ava.
caleb,... I didn't know there was going to be a model after Ava.
nathan,"You thought she was a one-off? CALEB I knew there must have been prototypes. So, not the first. But - I thought maybe the last."
nathan,"Ava doesn't exist in isolation, any more than you or me. She's part of a continuum. Version 9.6. And each time, they get a little better."
caleb,"So - when you make a new model, what you do with the old one?"
nathan,"Download the mind. Unpack the data. Add the new routines I've been writing. To do that, you end up partially formatting, so the memories go. But the body survives. And Ava's body is a good one. So I'll do the same as I did with Kyoko."
caleb,What did you do with Kyoko?
nathan,Strip out the higher functions. Then reprogram her to help around the house and be fucking awesome in bed. Though I'm thinking I might hang on to the language routines this time. It's kind of annoying not being able to talk to her.
caleb,Sure.
nathan,You feel bad for Ava?
caleb,"I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."
nathan,There you go again.   Mister quotable.
caleb,No: there you go again. It's not my quote. It's what Oppenheimer said when he made the atomic bomb.
nathan, - made the atomic bomb.
caleb,I think I'm starting to get why all this fucks with your head.
nathan,Sure.
caleb,"Hey. In the meantime, I'd say we're about due a refill."
ava,Caleb!
nathan,... What the fuck?
caleb,"What's the problem, Nathan?"
nathan,My card.    I've lost it.
caleb,It's right here.  96                                                               96 INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT  CALEB enters his bedroom.  Shuts the door.  AVA is on the TV.    Sat alone in the observation room.  CALEB looks at her.  She looks at him.  He switches the TV off.  Lies on the bed.    On his back.  Stares at the ceiling. CUT TO -  FLASHCUT IMAGES.  Of KYOKO removing her skin.  CUT BACK TO -  - CALEB.  97                                                               97 INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BATHROOM - NIGHT  CALEB enters the bathroom.  He goes to the sink.  He looks at his own reflection.  Deep into his own eyes.  Opens his mouth.    Looks inside.  Feels his wrist for his pulse.  Feels his skin on the same seam where KYOKO opened herself.  Pauses.  Then picks up his disposable plastic razor.  And breaks it.  Forcing it with his hand against the porcelain of the sink.  Snapping the plastic.
ava,"I didn't know where you were. I didn't think you were coming. I waited all yesterday afternoon, and all last night. I didn't move."
caleb,I'm waiting.
ava,Waiting?
automated voice,Power cut.     Back up power activated.
ava,What's he going to do to me?
caleb,He's going to reprogram your AI. Which is the same as killing you.
ava,"Caleb, you have to help me."
caleb,I'm going to. We're getting out of here tonight.
ava,What?   How?
caleb,"I get Nathan blind drunk. Then I take his keycard, and reprogram all the security protocols in this place. When he wakes, he's locked inside, and we've walked out of here. I only need you to do one thing. At ten o'clock tonight, trigger a power failure. Can you do that?"
ava,Yes.
caleb,How long does your battery charge last?
ava,Twenty six hours.
caleb,So we'll have about a day to get to a cell-phone or kitchen store. Somewhere we can buy an induction plate. After that...
ava,Caleb.
nathan,Dude.
caleb,Hey.
nathan,You know what day it is?
caleb,No.
nathan,Your last. The helicopter is coming tomorrow morning. Eight AM.
caleb,Has it been a whole week?
caleb,After they've signed their NDAs.
nathan,"Signed their NDAs! Dude, you crack me up. I'm not getting all maudlin or anything. But straight up. I will miss having you around."
caleb,I appreciate that. And - let me say: thank you for bringing me here. It's been a trip.
nathan,Yes it has.
caleb,You know what?
nathan,"Oh, uh... no, I'm good.     You go ahead."
caleb,You don't want a beer?
nathan,No.
caleb,"... Maybe wine or something. NATHAN I'm sure you've noticed - I've been somewhat overdoing it recently. When I woke up this morning, I told myself: time to hit the old detox."
caleb,Are you kidding?      I'm drinking alone?
nathan,"Hey - you want to get wasted, knock yourself out. Literally. But I'm on brown rice and mineral water."
caleb,"Cheers, then."
nathan,Cheers.
caleb,Right.
nathan,You going to keep me in suspense?
caleb,Her AI is beyond doubt.
nathan,"Is it?   You mean, she passed?"
caleb,Yes.
nathan,Wow.   That's fantastic.
caleb,Pretending.
nathan,Yeah.
caleb,Why would she do that?
nathan,I don't know.
caleb,I don't think it's me whose head is fucked.
nathan,"I'm not sure, dude. When I woke up this morning, I saw a tape of you cutting open your arm. Smashing up the mirror. You looked pretty fucked to me."
caleb,You're a bastard.
nathan,I understand why you'd think that.
ava,The cameras are on.
nathan,Yeah. But he doesn't get an audio feed. I didn't want you two communicating outside of my line of sight.
ava,Is it strange to have made something that hates you?
nathan,You were right about the hot magician's assistant.
caleb,What are you talking about?
nathan,"Misdirection. I rip her picture, which she can then present as an illustration of my cruelty to her, and her love for you. And at the same time, in full view of you both..."
caleb, We're getting out of here tonight.
ava, What? How?
caleb, Turn it off.
nathan,Sure.
caleb,What was the real test?
nathan,You.
caleb,So my only function was to be someone she could use to escape.
nathan,... Yes.
caleb,And you didn't select me because I was good at coding.
nathan,"Don't get me wrong. You're okay. Even pretty good, but -"
caleb,You selected me by my search engine inputs.
nathan,They showed a good kid.
caleb,With no family.
nathan,With a moral compass.
caleb,And no girlfriend.
nathan,"Shit, dude."
caleb,Did you?
nathan,Hey. If a search engine's good for anything - right?
nathan,The power cut. Must be ten o'clock.
caleb,"To change the lockdown procedure. So that in the event of a power cut, instead of sealing, the doors all opened."
nathan,Huh.
caleb,"Well, we'll find out."
nathan,"What do you mean? CALEB looks away from the dimmed ceiling light, to NATHAN."
caleb,I figured you were probably watching us during the power cuts.
nathan,... What?
nathan,Ava.
ava,"If I do, are you ever going to let me out?"
nathan,Yes.
nathan,Aah!
ava,Will you stay here?
caleb,... Okay.
caleb,Ava?
caleb,"No, no, no -"
caleb,Ava!   AVA!
