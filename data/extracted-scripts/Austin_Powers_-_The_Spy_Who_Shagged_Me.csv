Speaker,Dialogue
narrator,"In his last adventure, Austin Powers, a swinging spy from the Sixties, was unfrozen in the Nineties to battle his archenemy Dr.  Evil. Austin foiled Dr. Evil's plan to send a nuclear warhead to the center of the earth and banished him into space forever. Or so he thought."
vanessa,"I love you, Mr. Powers."
austin,"And I love you, Mrs. Powers."
vanessa,"Let's go out on the terrace. It's a beautiful night, we can look at the stars."
austin,Look how beautiful the night sky is.
vanessa,Isn't that the big dipper?
austin,"Yeah, and that looks just like Uranus."
vanessa,Austin!
austin," Well, you know."
vanessa,"Hey, I've never seen that big star before."
austin,"Yeah, what is that?"
austin,"Oh well, I guess it was nothing."
austin,"Care for some champagne?  Here's to monotony-- I mean, monogamy!"
austin,"Hello? Vanessa? What are you doing, luv?"
vanessa, Just putting on my--
fembot vanessa, MAKE-UP!
austin," Vanessa, you're a Fembot!"
austin,"Machine gun jubblies, how did I miss those?"
vanessa, PERHAPS NEXT TIME YOU SHOULD TRY FOREPLAY.
austin," Wait a tic! That means I'm single! Oh, behave!"
austin,"Yeah, baby, I'm free! I'm naked and free!"
austin,"Shaguar, baby, yeah!"
bobby,"Dad, I know you're against race mixing and all that, but I met someone..."
klansman,Don't say it!
bobby,I met someone... and he's black.
klansman,He?
jerry springer,Please welcome Tim.
jerry springer,"Now Scott, tell us about your father. Share with us."
scott,Well he's the head of an evil organization that has aspirations for world domination.
jerry springer,And where is your father right now?
scott,"He's in outer space, like frozen in a giant egg and stuffed inside a Big Boy rocket with his cat, Mr. Bigglesworth."
jerry springer,"Really? Well, we have a surprise for you, Scott. Let's bring out"
scott,I can't believe you'd do this to me on national television!
jerry springer,"Dr. Evil, we've seen a lot of the fathers here today open up to their sons, sons to the fathers. Is there anything you'd like to share?"
jerry springer,"Yes, don't you have any secrets?"
klansman,"What are you, some kind of freak?"
scott,"Shut up, jagoff!"
klansman,I'll kick your ass punk!
number two,"Dr. Evil, as the legitimate frontman of your organization, I seized upon the opportunity to invest in a small Seattle-based coffee company several years ago. Today, Starbucks is a far- flung empire with 2000 outlets worldwide."
number two,"If I may continue, I believe if we shift our resources away from world domination and focus on providing premium quality coffee drinks, we can increase our gross profits fivefold."
number two," Dr. Evil, I think you--"
number two,"May I add, I appreciate you reinstating me after our little... misunderstanding."
frau,"Zehr gut, Herr Doctor."
frau,I have come to embrace the love that dare not speak it's name. To my right is my lover.
frau,Her name is Unibrau. I met her on the LPGA Tour.
frau,"Doctor, you have a 'milk mustache.'"
number two,"Dr. Evil, I'd like to introduce the Greek assassin, Oedipus."
oedipus,I could give a shit.
oedipus,Yes.
number two," Dr. Evil, as you know, the rate at which you liquidate henchmen far exceeds our ability to replace them."
number two,"Well, Dr. Evil, perhaps I have the answer. While you were frozen, we began a program to clone you."
number two,"We had a few glitches, but I think you'll be pleased with the results."
frau, Send in the clone!
number two,"He is identical to you in every way, except he is one-eighth your size."
number two, Uh-hem.
number two,"No, not that I'm aware of."
scott,Because you never kill him when you get the chance and you're a dope?
number two,Mojo?
frau,"Yes, mojo. The mojo is the life force, the essence, the libido, the ""right stuff""."
scott,"If you've got a time machine, why don't you just go back and kill Austin Powers when he's a baby or something?"
number two," Dr. Evil, wouldn't it be easier to use your knowledge of the future to play the stock market? We could literally make trillions."
number two,Excuse me?
scott,"A trillion is more than a billion, numb-nuts."
scott,Can I come?
number two,Hello there.
british colonel,We've had reports that there's a spy in the Ministry of Defense.  The contents of this room are vital to the country. Be on special alert.
fat soldier," Those bastards will have to kill me before I let anything happen to this wee naked hairy popsicle, sir!"
british colonel,Very good. And try and lose some weight for God's sake!
fat soldier,Yessir!  I outta smash your teeth out with a Toffee Hammer Mr. English Colonel Telling-Me-What-To-Do-And-Stealing- our-Oil-Refusing-To-Recognize- our- Scottish-Independence!
austin,"Gor blimey, I'm on empty! That's funny, I just filled the Shaguar up this morning."
basil exposition," Hello, I'm Basil Exposition, head of British Intelligence."
austin,"You always are, Basil. Listen, the weirdest thing just happened, I've run out of petrol."
basil exposition,We'll send a man around immediately. How was your honeymoon?
austin,"Vanessa tried to kill me, Basil. She was a Fembot!"
basil exposition,"Ah women, who can understand them? Moving on, let's discuss your new case."
austin,"New case? Very shagadelic, Basil!"
basil exposition,You'll be doing a photo shoot. We know that one of the models is an ex- KGB agent selling top secret material to the highest bidder.
austin,"That sounds easy enough, you know what they say: all work and no shagging makes Austin a dull boy, man!"
austin," Tres chic, baby."
reg,"Austin, the models are ready."
austin,"Ta, Reg. Bless your cotton socks. Hey, Reg, do you have any hobbies?"
reg,What?
austin,"Hobbies, man! I for one enjoy making models!"
supermodels, It's him! Oh my God! It's Austin Powers!
austin,"One at a time, girls. One. At. A. Time!"
cindy,"Hi, I'm Cindy. I don't believe I've had the pleasure."
austin,"Of course you haven't had ""The Pleasure"", we just met, baby, yeah!"
rebecca,"How do you do, Austin? I'm Rebecca.  Your equipment is quite impressive."
austin,Thank you. Your breasts are amazing.
austin,"And what's your name, baby?"
model, Ivana Humpalot.
austin,Excuse me?
ivana,Ivana. Ivana Humpalot.
austin,"And I vanna toilet made of solid gold but it's just not in the cards, now is it?"
austin,"Alright, baby! Love it. Turn and pout for me baby! Smashing!"
austin,"Great, darling. Give me some shoulder. Yes, yes, yes.  No! No!"
austin," Show me love. Smashing! You're an animal. You're a tiger. Be a tiger, baby! You're great! You're Grrrrrr- eat! You're Tony, be corn flakes, baby, be frosted. Now be a lemur, baby! You're a ring-tailed lemur."
rebecca,A lemur?
austin,"A small mammal native to the African savannah. C'mon baby, you know. Like this!  I take it back. Be a tiger again. Smashing!"
austin,And... done! I'm spent!
reg,"Hel-lo, you forgot about Ivana."
austin,"I didn't forget, baby. Miss Humpalot and I are going to have a 'private session'."
ivana,"When did you get ""The Clapper""?"
austin,"November, 1964, Dutch East Indies, shore leave."
ivana,"Are you cold, Mr. Powers?"
austin,I once had a bad experience with frostbite. I had to dip my tadger into a brandy snifter.
ivana,Do you know how we keep warm in Russia?
austin,"I can guess, baby."
ivana,We play chess.
austin,I guessed wrong.
ivana,"It takes a keen intelligence to play chess. Of course, you know what they say about men with big brains, don't you?"
austin,They wear large hats?
ivana,"No, they make better lovers."
austin,Wrong again.
ivana,I assume you know how to play.
austin,Of course.  The... horsey... moves in an L shape.
austin,"Let's stop playing games with each other... especially difficult ones. May I ask you a question, Miss Humpalot?"
ivana,Of course.
austin,Do I make you horny? Do I?
ivana,"I'll tell you anything you want to know, just make love to me."
ivana,"You are hairy, like an animal!"
austin," Grrrr, baby."
austin,"Grrrr. Ruf! Ruf!  Wait a tick, I don't want him watching me while I'm on the job!"
ivana,"Make love to me, monkey man."
austin,"Groovy, baby!"
austin," Crikey, I've lost my mojo."
basil exposition,Where is he? In here?
basil exposition,"Austin, I came as soon as I heard."
austin,"There must be some kind of mistake, Basil. Maybe I was drunk and I didn't know it."
basil exposition,"What's wrong with your neck, Austin?"
austin," I took a Viagra and it got caught in my throat. I've had a stiff neck for hours. Basil, is it true? Have I lost my mojo?"
basil exposition,"We're going to run a few tests, Austin. Don't worry, old friend, we'll get to the bottom of this."
nurse,"Excuse me, Mr. Powers, I need to give you a sponge bath before we begin the test."
austin," Alright, miss, just let me finish this article on the Suez crisis."
austin,What's going on?
basil exposition,"Alright, everyone, we're done."
austin,But the test hasn't even started!
basil exposition,"Agent Haggerty was the test, Austin. Not only were you actually reading an article in that Playboy, but a candy-stripe nurse offering to give you a sponge bath didn't so much as turn your head."
austin,"Wait, I can explain, man! I was going to shag her but the article was so fascinating--"
basil exposition,"I'm sorry, Austin, I'm afraid it's true: you've lost your mojo."
austin," Without my mojo, I'm useless to the Ministry and to Her Majesty.  I think it's time to retire."
basil exposition,"I'm afraid that's not possible, Austin. You see, Dr. Evil has returned."
austin,Again?
basil exposition,Again.
basil exposition,We have evidence that Dr. Evil has developed a time machine.
basil exposition,Our researcher noticed that these photos from the archives have changed. That means Dr. Evil is traveling back in time and creating alliances with each decade's most despised villains.
austin,I can't read in the car. I get a bit vomy.
austin,Got it. I almost gipped.
austin,"But Basil, isn't that the new Volkswagen Beetle?"
basil exposition,That's what they'd like you to believe.
austin,"So, Basil, if I travel back to 1969 and I was frozen in 1967, I could go look at my frozen self. But, if I'm still frozen in 1967, how could I have been unthawed in the 90's and traveled back to the Sixties?  Oh, no, I've gone cross-eyed."
basil exposition, I suggest you don't worry about those things and just enjoy yourself.
austin,"This is smashing Basil. I'll go back to the Sixties, recharge my mojo, defeat Dr. Evil and be back in time for tea."
basil exposition,"Good luck, Austin."
austin,"Luck has nothing to do with it, Basil."
austin,"Sorry.  Swinging Sixties, here I come, baby, yeah!"
austin,"I feel better already, man!"
austin,"Alright, baby, a swinging shin-dig!"
austin," 'THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION, YOU CAN FEEL IT IN THE AIR.  PEOPLE SHAGGING JUST LIKE WEASELS AND THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO CARE."
austin," HEY, WATCH OUT SQUARES...  YOU MAKES US BORED!  THE PENIS IS MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD"
austin, THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION AND YOU AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET PEOPLE SHAGGING IN THE CLUBS AND INSIDE A JUMBO JET
austin, HEY SQUARE WORLD THE END IS NIGH. WHEN WE SAY HUMP YOU SAY 'HOW HIGH?'
austin, SO GO MAKE LOVE OR MASTURBATE-- SEXUAL FREEDOM WILL NEVER BE OUT OF DAAAAAAAAAAATE!
everyone, IT'S THE SIXTIES!
felicity,Care for a ride?
austin,"That's my Beetle, baby."
felicity,It was your Beetle. Get in.
felicity,"Austin Powers, I presume?"
austin,"Powers by name, Powers by reputation."
felicity,"Felicity Shagwell, CIA. Shagwell by name, Shag-very-Well by reputation."
austin," Crazy, baby!"
felicity,"Grab the wheel, would you?"
assassin,Ahhhhhhhh!
felicity,"Well, Austin, I think this time you may have met your match."
austin,"Oh, I've beaten Dr. Evil before, and I'll beat him again."
felicity,I was talking about me.
austin,"Welcome to my shag pad, baby."
austin,Care for something to drink?
austin,Or perhaps something to read?
austin,How about a hot cup of coffee?
felicity,"Yes, I rather fancy a grind."
austin,"Oh, Behave!"
austin,Would you like a... mas-sage? A sensssual mas-sage?
austin,"How does that feel, baby?"
felicity,"Mmm, lower."
austin," HOW DOES THAT FEEL, BABY?"
felicity,"Wait, something's itching me."
felicity,That's better.
austin,Crikey!!!
austin,Sorry.
austin," Hello, anyone home? C'mon lads, do it for England."
felicity,"Oh, that was so relaxing. Felicity stretches very sexily."
austin,Would you 'like to see my etchings?
felicity, I think I'm ready for bed.
austin,I'll get you some PJs.
felicity,"No, I'm ready for bed."
austin,"Oh, you'll want to clean your teeth then."
felicity,"No, I want to have sex with you, Austin."
austin,Hello Vicar!
felicity,"I've studied everything about you- your methods, your accomplishments, your preferences. You're the reason I became a spy. Now, I've waited two years to meet you, so I say we get busy making up for lost time."
austin," Felicity, I used to think that way, too, but I guess... I guess I've changed.  Not to make a short story long, or to ramble on and on, or to keep talking in a repetitive manner ad infinitum until it becomes impossible to remember what I was talking about in the first place, but- where was I?"
austin,"Oh yes. Felicity, I can't shag you. I've lost my mojo."
felicity, Oh.
austin,"I thought coming back to the Sixties would bring it back, but it hasn't."
felicity,"Austin, don't worry. I know just the man to help you. He's my guru. Ringo recommended him and he's the best."
austin,"I'll warm up the Jumbo Jet, baby!"
felicity,There he is. That's my guru.
felicity,"Guru, I'd like you to meet Austin Powers."
austin,How are you baby?
guru pitka,My chakras are aligned and I am in a perfect state of equipoise.
austin,Good on ya. I don't know what that means but it sounds fab.
felicity,"Guru, we need some advice."
guru pitka,Hold your horses and any other beasts- of burden. I must lead my disciples in meditation and then I will help you.
disciples,Ahhhhhh!
guru pitka,"My name is the Guru Pitka. I am a spiritual teacher and I have combined many disparate disciplines into a unified movement of human potentiality and equipoise that I learned from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who died mysteriously of a disease that strangely had all the hallmarks of syphilis. He would say to me, Sparky, love is all, life is breath."
disciples,Ahhhhhh!
guru pitka,"Now, perhaps you are wondering where I got the nickname Sparky.  Well, when we were young we used to play a game called ""Stinkmop"". We would urinate into a bucket, dip a mop into it, and play tag. I did not care for ""Stinkmop"" and a very wise old man said to me 'oh lighten up, Sparky', and I don't know, the name kind of stuck."
disciples,Ahhhhhhhh...
guru pitka,"Now, the reason I am a spiritualist instead of a therapist is that 'therapist' often becomes 'the rapist' and that will not help us attain potentiality. Now what is potentiality? It is the ability to achieve those goals that we wish to achieve for ourselves. People often say to me that they feel ""nowhere"", and I am going to change that to ""Now here."""
disciples,Ahhhhhhh...
guru pitka,"And you have many assumptions about your goals, but when you ""assume"" You make an ""ass"" out of ""u"" and ""me""."
disciples,Ahhhhhhh....
guru pitka,"The being, or that which we call 'ourselves', is not the tinker.  It is not the taughts. It is the Gap between the tinker and the taughts! We are not our mind, we are not our body, we are the Gap!"
disciples,Ahhhhh...
guru pitka," The heart of the matter is that you are the heart of the matter.  There is no ""I"" in ""team"". Beer before liquor, never sicker. Don't take a wooden nickel.  If your pipe is short and your pump is weak, you better stand close or you'll piss on your feet. He who goes to bed with itchy bum wakes up with smelly finger."
disciples,Ahhhhh...
guru pitka,"Finally, the path to spiritual awakening requires the death of ego. Leggo of my ego! Let us end with the mantra: Om Ay Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay Vant Yu Hu."
disciples, Om Ay Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay Vant Yu Hu.
guru pitka,"Go with God, and pay at the door please."
guru pitka,How can I help you?
austin,"Guru, I'm having trouble performing."
guru pitka,What do you mean?
austin,You know- my bits and pieces are a bit sleepy.
guru pitka,I'm not understanding.
austin,I've forgotten the steps to the Mummy- Daddy dance.
guru pitka,Still not clear.
austin,My flag's at half mast and no one will salute it.
guru pitka,Sorry?
austin,My Willie don't work.
guru pitka,Why are you beating around the bush?
austin,That's my problem.
guru pitka,"Ohhhhh, I get it.  No, I don't get it."
felicity,He's impotent!
austin,"Alright, easy.  Felicity and I were all set for some hump Olympics and I couldn't bat for six."
guru pitka,"Oh, yes, I see."
austin,"You have no idea what I'm saying, do you?"
guru pitka,Not a word.
austin,"Guru, I've lost my mojo."
guru pitka,"Oh, mojo! You should have said so. Well, you've lost your mojo because your chakras are misaligned. You have lost love."
austin,"Lost love? Oh, you mean Vanessa?"
felicity,Who's Vanessa?
austin,She was an evil robot minion of Dr. Evil. I couldn't have loved her.
guru pitka,"Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, buddy. You will only get your mojo back when you surround yourself with love."
austin,"Oh, I get what you're saying now! He's talking about free love, baby! Tune in, turn on, and drop out!"
guru pitka,I am talking about true love. You must stay and study until you are worthy.
austin,"No way, man. The only way to surround yourself with love is to throw a swinging shin-dig! Yeah, baby, yeah!"
fat bastard,"First things first, where's your shitter? I've gotta bleepin, turtle head pokin' out."
fat bastard,"I've got a lot of demons kickin' around in my noggin, but weight issues ain't one of them."
fat bastard,"The name is Fat Bastard!  I'm the incorrect weight for my height and I was born out of wedlock, hence the moniker Fat Bastard. Hey, I'm not kiddin'. I've got a crap on deck that could choke a donkey."
fat bastard,Where's my  money?
fat bastard,"Fine, you can take your !"
fat bastard, you!
fat bastard,"Alright, here it is."
number two,"Dr. Evil, I have some bad news. Austin Powers is back in the Sixties. One of our best assassins spotted him but he got away."
number two,"There is another. Felicity Shagwell, CIA."
scott,"I don't know, I was sitting around watching the tube and The Courtship of Eddie's Father came on Nick at Nite, you know, and I was just listening to that theme song--  Anyway it made me think that maybe we could try and work things out. You know, you are my Dad and I need you."
scott, Nothing Darth.
scott,Nothing.  Rip-off!
scott,"The Alan Parsons Project was a progressive rock band from 1982. Why don't you just name it Operation Wang Chung, ass?"
number two,"My God, Dr. Evil, you destroyed the Wihite House with no warning!"
scott,"Yeah, Codename: Thompson Twins was really impressive."
scott,"I'm nineteen, I don't-"
scott,You are so lame-
number two,"Dr. Evil, what are we going to do about Powers?"
fat bastard,It'll be my pleasure.
austin,"This shag-in is gonna blow your mind, baby, yeah!"
pregnant woman,Hey!
austin,"You'll thank me later, baby."
austin," Hey! Ricardo Monteblan, how are you?"
ricardo,"Hello, Austin! Balls, said the queen and the king laughed because he had too."
austin," Crazy, man!"
felicity,Let's split up and scope the scene.
austin,Don't do anything I wouldn't do- at least not without me.
austin,"Oh, behave!"
austin," You're very exotic, baby. Do you have a little English in you?"
chick,No.
austin,Would you like to?
london cop,Have you ever been picked up by the fuzz?
felicity,"No, but I bet it really hurts."
austin,The Austin Powers Sexy Dictionary defines an Eskimo hooker as a frosty prosty.
eskimo, I don't get it.
austin,"Those are skin tight. How do you get into those pants, baby?"
felicity,Well you can start by buying me a drink.
viking,"You were great last night. By the way, I'm Thor."
felicity,You're Thor? I'm tho thor I can hardly thit.
austin," Hello, I am Baron Von Firstinbed. Last night I had German-Chinese food. An hour later I was hungry- for power."
zeus guy,"Oh puh-leez, why don't you take a handful of F-off pills?"
austin,Did you hear about the contortionist who was engaged to be married?
felicity,"Yeah, I heard she broke it off."
artie johnson,Verrrrry interesting- but shtupid!
felicity,Look at that.
austin,That's not a pretty sight. Who is he?
felicity,"Until recently he worked security for the MOD, but we think he might be a double agent, possibly for Dr. Evil."
austin,How do you know?
felicity,"We've noticed that his lifestyle has changed dramatically. He's made a lot of cash purchases, he's hanging out with foxes half his age, and he's becomes quite a fixture on the London party circuit."
austin,Who's the girl?
felicity,"I don't know, but it looks like he's splitting."
felicity,I'll follow him. You see what you can get out of the girl. We'll rendezvous later.
austin,"Hello, hello."
girl,"Hello, Mr. Powers. Fab party."
austin,"Who are you today, baby?"
girl,Robin. Robin Swallows.
austin,Swallows? That's an interesting name. Are you English?
robin swallows,"German, actually. My maiden name is Spitz."
austin,"Well which is it, baby, Spitz or Swallows? Either way, it's a pleasure."
robin swallows,The pleasure is mine.
austin,"Charmed, I'm sure.  I love shaking hands."
austin," So, who was your friend?"
robin swallows,His name is Fat Bastard.
austin,It suits him.
robin swallows,He's my lover.
austin,OK. Would you happen to know if he's in business with a man named Mr. Evil?
robin swallows,I don't know anyone named Dr. Evil.
austin,Really? I said Mister Evil. Austin does a smug take.
austin,Something to drink? Would you like a Mister Pepper?
robin swallows,"Yes, I'd love a Doctor Pepper."
austin,Really? I said Mister Pepper.
robin swallows,"You're a groovy boy, I'd like to strap you on sometime."
austin,"Oh, behave!"
fat bastard,"...and I'll have a fried-prawn sandwich, with extra mayonnaise, two whole chickens, a kidney pie, a toad in the hole, bubble and squeak, bangers and mash, 3 orders of fish and chips, and... a Fresca. No ice."
felicity,I love a man with a large appetite.
fat bastard,And I love a woman with big ing.
austin,Can I ask you a question?
robin swallows,Yes.
austin,Thank you.
robin swallows,"Well, what's the question?"
austin,"Oh, yes. Would you like to shag? Would you?"
robin swallows,"I'd love to, Mr. Powers, just come right... over... here."
austin,You're a bit of alright.
robin swallows, Oedipus... use the revolver.
robin swallows, Oedipus... use the machine gun.
robin swallows,"Oedipus, Oedipus..."
austin,"Sorry baby, too late. He's as dead as vaudeville."
robin swallows,"You can't win, Powers. Dr. Evil has your mojo and it's only a matter of time before he kills you and takes over the world.  Tell Fat Bastard I'll miss him..."
fat bastard,I always get in' hungry after I get my end away!
felicity,"I never would have thought that a man of such tremendous girth could be such a, um, creative and sensuous lover!"
fat bastard,You want some chicken? I have more!
fat bastard,Frisky are we? Alright lets have another go!
president,"Dr. Evil, what do you want?"
president,Dr. Evil that's more than the entire
president,That much money simply doesn't exist. I don't think l00 billion is even a number. It's like saying I want a kajillion bajillion dollars.
president,What?
president,"I'm sorry, I don't understand."
scott,"It's 1969. That movie won't come out for another 30 years, ass.  They don't know what you're talking about."
president,But-
number two,"Dr. Evil, one last thing. I-- oh."
felicity,"Austin, tell me about the Nineties."
austin,"You know I can't tell you details about the future, baby, it could alter history."
felicity,"Not details, just what it's like. You know, what's the scene?  Where's it at?"
austin,"There've been a lot of advances in the Nineties, baby. The economy is stable, people take better care of their health concern for the environment is on the rise and, um, let's see, there's an entire television channel dedicated to golf."
felicity,Sounds awful.
austin,"It's not so bad once you get used to it. The Nineties are about responsibility. You know, having respect for yourself and other people. I even got married."
felicity,You? Married? What about the sexual revolution?
austin,"Well, it turns out there were some casualties, baby. Don't you think you'll ever get married?"
felicity,"No, not until I get a little more 'experience' under my belt."
austin,"Oh, behave!"
austin, Oh my God!
felicity, What is it! Is it Fat Bastard?
austin,"No, written here on my hand, see?"
austin,Says 'Oh my God!'
felicity,"Austin, look."
austin,"Felicity, I haven't had this much fun since I worked undercover in Amsterdam-- '66 I think it was."
felicity,"1965, actually. You posed as a Dutch cheese expert to stop Dr.  Evil from poisoning the world's water supply."
felicity,"I've studied your file, Austin. I want to be a trailblazer, just like you.  The Seventies are right around the corner. It's going to be a glorious time for fashion and music and technology-- it won't be long before every flying car has its own 8-track."
felicity,"The CIA has always been a boy's club until now. Well move over, this chick's taking over."
austin, Very impressive.
felicity,"Austin, your voice!"
austin,"Yes, I think I'm coming down with something."
austin,I'll get some ice cream. Would you like some?
felicity,No thanks.
austin," Could I have two scoops of Vanilla, please?"
austin," Yes, please."
austin," I will, thank you."
austin, Yes please.
austin,"No, laryngitis."
austin, Basil!
basil exposition,"Hello, Austin. What's wrong with your voice?"
austin," I just had ice cream. Listen to me, I have dairy throat.  ""Mary had a little lamb and it was always gruntin'. She tied it to a five bar gate and kicked it's little-"
basil exposition," Austin! Things are heating up, so I thought it best to contact you in disguise. Felicity, your plan worked. You and Austin track Fat Bastard back to Dr. Evil."
austin,But how can we track Fat Bastard?
felicity,I planted a homing device on him last night.
basil exposition,"Yes, and we're starting to pick up the signal now."
austin,How did you get close enough to plant a homing device?
felicity,"I shagged him, I shagged him rotten."
austin,You... him? Just like that?
felicity,"Yes, Austin, we needed that information."
basil exposition,"Well, thanks to your effort, Felicity, we now know that-"
austin, Did you use an elaborate set of pulleys? A block and tackle?
basil exposition,"Anyway, you two follow the signal back to Dr. Evil's headquarters and then-"
austin," I just can't get my head around it, baby. You're so small and he's so ... not small. The sheer mechanics of it are mindboggling!"
basil exposition,"Never mind, Austin, you two have work to do. You must find Dr.  Evil."
austin,"I got it! A Chinese basket with a counter-weighted ballast.  That's how you did it, right?"
felicity,"Austin, it almost sounds like you're jealous."
austin,"Who, me? That's not possible, baby!  is it?"
austin,Get down!
felicity,We're obviously on the right track.  It looks like Fat Bastard is-on an island in the middle of the ocean.
austin,"According to the readings, Dr. Evil's headquarters is over the next ridge."
felicity,Can I have a look?
austin,Sure.
felicity,"Question is, how do we get in?"
austin, Mmmmmmm...mmmmm...
felicity,"Austin, did you hear me?"
austin,I seem to be stuck in your dirty pillows.
felicity,Where are the topographical maps that Basil drew up?
austin,I think they're in the tent.
felicity,"Here we go, one hammer. It's amazing how much this duffel bag will hold."
number two,"Dr. Evil, that was fantastic, but I do have some bad news.  Powers' is on the island."
number two,"Don't worry, Dr. Evil, we can get to him by using the girl."
number two,I have the perfect weapon. Frau?
frau, Bring in the He-Bots!
number two,"Dr. Evil, may I present the He-Bots. What kind of woman could resist these perfect specimens of masculinity? Their clothes are stylish, their posture is ramrod straight, and their buttocks are tight, like tigers. And, each He-Bot is armed with a secret weapon."
fat bastard,"Christ Almighty, it smells terrible in here."
fat bastard,"Great, now it smells like someone took a shite in a pine tree."
number two,"Dr. Evil, the laser has been loaded into the rocket. You're ready for launch."
austin,"We meet again, Dr. Evil."
austin,Dr. Evil your plan will never--
austin,My mojo!
felicity,"Dr. Evil, do you like real estate?"
felicity,Now you've got a couple of achers.
austin," I don't care if he is evil, you don't give a man a shot in the pills. It's just not cricket, baby."
scott,"She just hoofed you in the sack and you're going to leave them alone in a jail cell with one inept guard? They'll escape, dipshit. You do this every time!"
scott,You don't own me!
fat bastard,What about Powers?
number two,"Five, four, three..."
operator,"Colonel, you better have a look at this radar."
colonel,"What is it, son?"
operator,"I don't know, sir, but it looks like a giant--"
pilot,Dick!
pilot,Take a look out of starboard.
man,Pecker!
woman,Where?
man,"Over there. A rare red-billed woodpecker!  What sort of bird is that? Oh goodness, it's not a bird, it's-"
sergeant,"Privates! We have reports of an Unidentified Flying Object. It has a long, smooth shaft, complete with-"
umpire,Two balls! No strikes.  What is that? It looks just like an enormous--
colonel,Johnson!
radar operator,"Yes, sir?"
colonel,Get on the horn to British Intelligence and let them know about this.
felicity,How are we going to get out of here?
austin,Why don't you just shag Fat Bastard again?
felicity," Austin, that is it! I don't know what happened to you in the Nineties, but I'm still here, in the Sixties, and I still swing! Don't try to lay your hang-ups on me just because you lost your mojo! That one hurts."
austin,"Ouch, baby, very ouch. I'm wounded."
felicity,"I'm sorry, Austin, that was a cheap shot."
austin,"No, baby, you're right. I was wrong to judge you. I guess I am... jealous."
felicity,But the Austin Powers I knew was wild and crazy and free. He could never be jealous.
austin,"That Austin is gone. I've changed. I knew someone, not long ago, a very special woman. She taught me that life isn't about jumping into the sack with whoever comes along, it's about caring and responsibility. And while it is true she turned out to be an evil robot minion of Dr. Evil, I suppose I really did... love her."
felicity,Was that your wife?
austin,"Yes, Vanessa."
felicity,"Listen, Austin, I can't pretend to understand everything you've gone through, but I trust you. I'll make you a deal: if we get out of here alive, I'll give monogamy a try."
austin,With me?
felicity,"Yes, silly."
austin,"Groovy, baby!"
felicity,We need to lure the guard inside and get his key.
austin,"Alright, what if I pretend to be desperately ill with food poisoning? The guard, drawn by my cries of pain, will come to investigate.  Meanwhile, you dig a pit and line it with makeshift punji sticks made from sharpened toothbrushes. The guard falls in, Bob's your uncle, and we've got the key.  What do you think?"
felicity,"That might work, but how about this?"
felicity," What do you think of these, my man?"
guard,Mommy...
felicity," It's very hot in here, don't you think?"
felicity," It's very hot in here, don't you think?"
felicity, Austin!
austin, I'm very firmly wedged.
felicity,If you want something done...
austin,Almost... got it!
austin,Let's go get my mojo!
felicity,"Where's your mojo, Austin?"
austin,I'm not sure.
austin,"Watch out, baby, He-Bots!"
austin,I can't fight them without my mojo.
felicity,Who said anything about fighting?
austin,"Smashing, Felicity, you were making me very horny, man! Extremely randy, indeed!"
austin,Fat Bastard!
fat bastard,"Looking for this, Mr. Powers?"
austin,"Give me back my mojo, Fat Bastard!"
fat bastard,"I give the orders,  for brains. Guards, take them back to their cells."
felicity,"Hold on, let me ask you one question."
fat bastard,"Alright, I guess I owe you that much for a night of carnal ecstasy."
felicity,Are you happy?
fat bastard,What kind of stupid ass question is that? I'm in' rich and I'm up to my tits in clean stinky.
felicity,"You didn't answer my question, are you happy?"
fat bastard,"It's about my girth isn't it? Sure I could lose a few pounds, but I could shiva git!"
felicity,Are you happy?
fat bastard,"Of course I'm not happy. Look at me, I'm a big fat slob. I've got bigger titties than you do! I've got more  I'm caught in a cycle and there's no escape!"
austin,"Maybe inside that Fat Bastard there's a thin bastard, trying to get out"
fat bastard,"Maybe there's big crap inside me trying to get out, jack-ass!  Enough of your in' fork?  I'm so weak, I hate myself. I'm for shite. Here, take the mojo."
fat bastard,"I appreciate you trying to reach me, no one can do it for me, I know this now.  There's a hole in my soul that food won't fill. This is the beginning of a new me. I'm gonna go to the gym everyday. If you'll excuse me, there's someone I have to get in touch with and forgive... myself.  It's a long road ahead."
austin,"Hold on, I have something very important to do."
felicity,How do you feel?
austin,"Sound as a pound, my spuds are boiling. Fancy a shag?"
felicity,"Austin, we don't have time."
austin,"C'mon, luv, let's hop on the good foot and do the bad thing!"
felicity,Dr. Evil's taken his laser to the moon. The world is in danger.
austin,"Right, the moon. I think I know someone who can give us a lift."
austin,"Gor blimey, you'd have to be a rocket scientist to figure this stuff out."
astronaut,I am a rocket scientist.
austin,"Felicity, if you get frightened, just hold my hand."
felicity, Yaaaaa-hoooo!
basil exposition,"Austin, you have achieved lunar orbit. How was that lift-off?"
austin,"To be honest it was terrifying. It felt like sitting on top of a bomb. As I punched through the atmosphere, I said 'Oh my God!' and I soiled myself."
basil exposition,Happens all the time in that situation.
austin,"No, I mean I soiled myself just now when I said oh 'my God!'"
felicity,"Basil, it was amazing!"
basil exposition,Prepare for moon landing. We only have one hour until Dr. Evil fires the laser!
austin,"This is one small step for man, but a giant step for shagging.  Can you imagine it, baby, weightless? The permutations are mind-boggling."
felicity,Naughty boy!
austin,God Save the Queen.
mission commander,"The Queen? This is an American show, goddammit. Let's roll that footage we shot last week in the studio."
president,What? I can't hear you.
president,"I'm sorry, I just can't hear you."
president,Better.
president,Sorry! I just can't- I think it's that alarm.
president,"Please Dr. Evil, be reasonable. That's more money than is in the entire Federal Treasury!"
president,I still don't know what that means. I can't show you the money because we don't have the money.
basil exposition,"Gentlemen, Austin has landed on the moon. We'll soon know whether he has succeeded or whether the world will be destroyed!"
felicity,Let's find Dr. Evil.
austin,Shhh...
felicity,"Austin, you've done it! You got Dr. Evil!"
austin,"Of course I did, baby, I got my mojo working overtime."
felicity,"Austin, I'm going ahead. Cover my rear!"
austin,"Oh, behave!"
austin,"Poor little bugger. He's so small, he's like a dog or something."
austin,"Poor little bugger.  Felicity, be careful! Dr. Evil is still alive! Felicity?"
austin," Alright, slap-head, turn around. Slowly."
austin,Felicity!  What have you done to her?
felicity, Don't worry about me Austin. You've got to save the world!
austin,"I've got my mojo back, man, I can do both."
austin,"Hands off my joystick, baby."
austin,"See, Dr. Evil I told you I could do both."
austin,Noooooo!
austin,"Felicity! Felicity. Wake up! Wake up! Please God, don't take her away."
austin,"Felicity, you have to understand, I thought I had my mojo back.  This isn't fair."
austin,"I love you, Felicity! I know I couldn't say it before, but I really do love you!  Dr. Evil, I'll kill him!"
austin,"I have to commandeer this vehicle.  Hey, aren't you Hutch?"
david soul,I'm Hutch.
james cameron,I'm king of the world!
austin,"I'm going to kill you, you bastard!"
austin,Really?
austin,How so?
austin,"I didn't think that Felicity was going to die, man."
austin,Felicity!
austin,"I choose love, baby."
austin,"Felicity, I love you."
felicity, But I thought-
austin,"That was another place and another time, baby."
felicity, Can't. Breathe.
austin,"Sorry, baby, I got a little over- stimulated."
austin,What do we do?
felicity,Use your mojo!
austin,I don't have it!
felicity,"Trust me, you do!"
basil exposition,"He did it, he saved the world!  Of course, I thought he might."
felicity,"Austin, you did it!"
austin,Uh-oh.  I think I just got my mojo back. Really.
felicity,"Austin, you had it all along. No one can take your, mojo away from you!"
radar operator,"Sir, you better have a look at this radar."
colonel,What is it?
radar operator,"don't know, sir. It's hard to describe.  It's... it's-"
doctor,Just a little prick!
doctor,"All done!  Good lord, what is that? If I didn't know better I'd say it's a-"
chinese teacher,Wang!
chinese teacher,Pay attention!
chinese student,"I'm sorry, Comrade Teacher.  was distracted by that enormous flying-"
rachel hunter,Rod?
rod stewart,"Yes, Rachel?"
rachel hunter, What's that?
rod stewart, It looks like a giant-
basil exposition,Peters!
captain peters,"Yes, sir?"
basil exposition,Any word from Austin?
captain peters,"We've picked up his signal, but the lunar base seems to self-destructing."
basil exposition," Austin, if you can hear me, use the time portal! There's no time to get to the lunar module! Use the time portal!"
felicity,"Austin, you have to get to the time portal!"
austin,"Come with me, Felicity! It's the only way out!"
felicity,"Austin, will I fit in the Nineties?"
austin,"If I did, anyone can. Let's go, baby!"
felicity,Sorry!
austin,"Don't worry baby it takes some getting used to. Let me ask you Felicity, do you feel any side effects from the time travel?"
felicity,I'm as healthy as a horse.
austin,"I love you, Felicity."
felicity,And I love you.
austin,Do you want to get married?
felicity,Absolutely not.
austin,Thank God.
