cassius, ...you be the first eatin' his words!
the doctor, 210 over 110?! I can't let him in the ring in this condition!
reporters, ...odds 7:1 against you. Big bet's whether he'll knock you out in the first round or third round or kill you altogether. You scared of him?
cassius,"I'm scared of no man. I give Sonny Liston talking lessons, boxing lessons and falling down lessons."
cassius,"""Black Muslim""'s a press word..."
angelo dundee,Man's religion's his own business. What kinda question's that?
angelo dundee, Howard!
howard cosell,"...cannot stand you, Cassius.   He really wants to kill you..."
cassius,"Howard Cosell, you are an instigator!  How you get that way? When I'm done with Liston, I'm comin' for you!"
doctor," It doesn't come down, I cancel this fight. You call me in an hour with his blood pressure."
bundini," I'm called Bundini, rhymes with Houdini. He was a Jew, too...some other people call me Fastblack...or Daddy Mac..."
cassius,Who Shorty?
bundini,"I call him Shorty 'cause he like 'em circumcised. Original people. Like Moses. And I was a babe in a basket, too. I was born on a doorstep with a note 'cross my chest that read, ""Do the best you can for him, world."" I had to suck the first nipple come along. I didn't run away from home...I been runnin' to home."
cassius,"...I study every fight. 'Til I got a plan. Wear him down two through four. Drop him in the fifth round. So the p'diction ain't a p'diction. It's a plan. And 'cause of all the poppin' off I do, I know I gotta win! That's the truth. And why I'm tellin' you?"
bundini,"'Cause I'm gonna be your Inspiration. Your motivator. In your corner. Can I be in your corner, young man?"
cassius, Yeah...
bundini, Ain't spent much time in Miami. Where the water?
pacheco,120 over 80?  You should be asleep...
cassius,When you get back?
rudy,I'm gonna find Mom and Dad.
cassius,You could have stayed. Nobody gotta hide when they with me.
angelo dundee, He's right.
cassius,"He was supposed to kill me.   Well, I'm still alive."
announcer, He's opened a cut on Liston. Liston's never been cut!
cassius, He's nothin' to me...
cassius,...my eyes!
cassius, My eyes! I can't see...somethin' in my eyes!
cassius, Cut 'em off! Cut 'em!   I'm blind.
angelo dundee,"No. You quit, it's over! Get out there. Be a yardstick. This is the big one, daddy. Get out there and run!"
howard cosell," ...Clay, a round ago, looked like he'd about had it, but in round six..."
cassius,I upset the world! I am the greatest! I am the greatest!
howard cosell,What made him so easy for you?
cassius,I told you. Didn't I tell you?
howard cosell,Was there any single point you knew you had him?
cassius,"I had him in the first round. 'Cause I'm the greatest!  Sam... Hey, Sam! Let him up."
gordon davidson,...I don't care what should have been ordered! We need a victory party right now. 
girl,Why's he so scared?
cassius,"The Mummy! ""I can't get away from the mummy!"" Yeah, but that mummy too slow to catch anybody."
sam cooke,Hey!   The mummy always gets his man...
cassius,"No, he don't!  Now, don't believe that stuff on television..."
a reporter,"The people look to you. Do you plan on being a people's champ, like Joe Louis?"
cassius," But not like Joe Louis, exactly..."
a reporter, Mr. Clay...?
reporters, You a card-carrying member?    Aren't Black Muslims a hate group?
cassius," ""Card-carrying""...? Don't need no ""card."" You got a Christian card? 750 million people believe in Islam. I'm one of them."
cassius,I'm going to be a people's champion. But I don't have to be the way you want me to be. I'm gonna be what I want. And I'm free to think any way I want...
cassius," ...watchin' a show on termites...they knockin' down this house, here."
cassius,Six million in your house and you don't know it. Where?
cassius,"Africa? No. Only Rome.      Yeah, man, let's go!"
cassius,When we leaving?
cassius, What is it?
cassius, Tore out a picture of Emmett Till when I was little. Couldn't take my eyes to it...couldn't look at it. Barb-wire around his neck to a 75- pound cotton-gin fan. Took out his eye. The cruelty to it...I couldn't look at it...couldn't throw it away.
cassius,"I thought, ""What I do wrong to be so low that people could do that to people like me?"" It made me feel ashamed. And that makes no sense. But that's what it was."
cassius,You can fix that...
elijah muhammad,"Only after long service and high merit in the spiritual and physical rebirth of Afro-American people...is one granted an original name. But you are special. A world champion. So there is a gift I wish to give you. From this day forward you will be known as Muhammad Ali...which means ""one worthy of praise,"" and Ali means ""most high."""
cassius," ""Worthy of praise..."" Thank you!"
elijah muhammad," Be very careful what you say...your words reflect on the nation of Islam, now."
cassius,"Yes, sir."
elijah muhammad, I do not feel this is a wise course anymore.
cassius," This is a great honor, Messenger..."
a neighbor,One more.  Thank you.
ali,When the contract run out. I want black lawyers and managers. Chauncey Eskridge on North La Salle Street...
ali,"I don't need no ""protectin'"" from myself. Why I need protecting from myself by them...?"
ali,"I ain't one of their thoroughbreds! Or their charity things. ""Let's do somethin' for that well-behaved colored boy, Cassius."" I ain't well-behaved nothing! I am a man."
ali,That's right.
ali,"No one ""made me""..."
ali, No one's in that ring but me!
ali,"I know who I'm not...I'm not drinkin'! Goin' back on my wife! I am not prayin' to no blue-eyed, blonde-haired Jesus. I ain't..."
odessa clay,"You didn't get it from me...your words, your sense of humor, what makes you angry, what makes you a fighter. You got that from your daddy..."
ali,You saying I'm just like him?
odessa clay,"I'm saying, if he was your age today, he'd do the same as you. And he knows that."
betty shabazz, Malcolm?
betty shabazz,Go anyway. Don't put it off.      It's not safe here. ONE OF HIS CHILDREN  Mommy...the bath's ready...
ali," Hey, man, where they put the real pilot? What you doin' up here?"
pilot," Here, Mr. Clay, sit down..."
ali,"No, man, I meant...in L'ville, when I growed up, they barely let black folks drive buses."
the pilot,Here we are. Cote d'Ivoire...Africa.

ali,"Man, where should I go?   We're planning on Egypt."
bradley, Un moment...
bradley, Il n'y a pas de quoi. Cela m'a fait grand plaisir. Faites-lui mes compliments.
marlin thomas,Malcolm bumped into Cassius Clay. Muhammad Ali...whatever he calls himself...
bradley,I thought that was all over. Is Clay going to support Malcolm's U.N. resolution?
marlin thomas,I don't know.
bradley,Find out. We'll pick up on Malcolm in Liberia ourselves.
ali, ...shouldn't have quarreled with the Honorable Elijah...
ali,You shouldn't have quarreled with Elijah Muhammad.

ali,"'Cause I love it, girl. How long you been workin' for Herbert?"
sonji,"'Bout a year. I sell ""Muhammad Speaks"" over the phone..."
ali,What kind of name is that?
sonji,My father named me after Sonja Henie.
ali,What's your father do?
sonji,"He was shot in a poker game when I was two. He don't do nothin'. Sonja, on the other hand, was an ice skater, and my mother died when I was eleven."
ali,So who raised you?
sonji,"Godparents, but I been on my own, doing my own thing..."
ali,Whatcha doin' tomorrow?       Go ridin' with me.
sonji,"No.   I gotta work, you know."

sonji,A record player?     C'mon.    How come it don't skip?
ali,Got springs and stuff.
sonji,Herbert said you met The Beatles.
ali,Yeah. Only one of 'em's smart...the one with the glasses.
sonji,...he's my favorite.
ali,"People all screaming and fainting. I asked him, ""This the way they act when you get big?"""
sonji,What he say?

sonji,Wow...

sonji,Yeah...
ali, Where you live?
sonji,I'm takin' you there...
ali,"I think I gonna keep you around forever, girl."
sonji," Well, I'm not too busy right now, so...I'll think on it."
ali,Herbert said you weren't a Muslim.
sonji,"Cover my hair? No make-up?     Long dresses? Honey, please.  Were you a virgin?"
ali,Why?
sonji," 'Cause you so ""gone"" off a little good time."
ali,"I'm no virgin...but I may as well be.  I ain't jokin'! I always know when I know. See this face? I mean, you got a pretty face for a girl's face, but you ever seen somethin' as pretty as me? Now, you about five-foot-three...that's too small. But I overlook that, too, 'cause..."
sonji, Thank you so much.
ali,...'cause of your spirit!
sonji,"My ""spirit""...?"
ali,Yeah.   'Cause you too much fun!
sonji,You serious?
ali,But you gotta be a Muslim.
sonji,Huh? How you do that? Step over a broom...shazaam...you a Muslim?
ali,"Maaan, I ain't never been with a girl like you."
sonji,"Baby, maybe you ain't ever gonna be with any other."
herbert,What?
ali,That's right.   I wanna marry her.
herbert,You can't marry that girl! She was a date! Have some fun! She's not your wife! You don't marry this girl.  Sign there. Management papers. My father will kill me.
bundini,True love!
bingham,"Watch what you signing, Ali."
herbert, Nothing to do with you.
bingham,"You talkin' to me, or someone walk inna room, fat boy? Anything's do to with me I think's to d-d-do with me...I'm st-st-still a Christian."
ali, And get me a kosher cook...lady who cooks at Malcolm's temple. Put my brother on the payroll. 50g a year for drivin' and jivin'.
herbert,Lana Shabazz...
ali,"Yeah. How 'bout it, Howard. You be my official full-time photographer."
bingham,"I ain't goin' on your payroll. I like it freelance. Emphasis on ""free."""
herbert,"Muhammad. She's not...for you. When I met her, she was working at a cocktail lounge with a bunny tail on her backside."
bundini,"What were you doin' down at a cocktail lounge, Herbert? Sellin' ""Muhammad Peeks""?"
herbert," Sober up and say something to this man, Bundini. You supposed to be his ""inspiration."""
bingham,"You been s-s-saving it up, training, Champ. You can't unleash it on this girl all sudden. You may kill her! Maybe you should spread it around more before you tie it down."
ali,No. Marriage is the cornerstone of Muslim life.
herbert,Sonji Roi is not a Muslim!
ali,"She gonna be a Muslim, now!  So fix it up, Herbert."
joe smiley,"The idea was...to...make...Malcolm smaller, you know? Diminished; obscure? Not to turn him into a messiah. "
joe smiley,"Thyroid. I got a stab wound in 1961. They took it out. We gotta talk about this guy, too."
ali, What you drinkin'?
bundini,"What am I drinkin'? Water's what I'm drinkin', champ! I'm a natural man..."
ali,What's goin' on?     We're late.
bundini,Come on in...!  What's that?
room service," What you wanted, isn't it...a water glass with vodka...?"
bundini,That was before...
room service,Before what?
bundini,Before you showed up...
sonji,I fine runnin' around in all these cute short things for you. I submissive to you. But I ain't gonna be submissive to the Brother X's and what they think. They askin' me questions alla time anyway.
ali,What questions?!
sonji,I don't drink. I don't smoke. I converted to Islam for you and...
sonji,"All except the dress! I ain't puttin' no bleached-out, double- ugly bedsheets on this body, honey! I'm normal!"
the gathered,Wa-Alaikum-Salaam...
crazy man,Ambushed!
ali,What? CRAZY MAN  They killed Malcolm...they shot Malcolm.
ali," You were the first...you walked me forward, my brother...you were the first..."
sam cooke," ""Been a long, long time comin', but a change gonna come, yes it is..."""
ali,"meets Liston, nails him with a straight right. Ali begins baiting him, dancing. Liston tries to cut off the ring, jabbing ineffectually. Ali lets Liston in, pulls back, then pivots on his right foot, throws a short right and RAMP INTO SLO-MO...to see Liston not see it coming."
ali,"Get up, sucker! Get up and fight! No one gonna believe this!"
howard cosell,It's over; it's over!
sonji,You okay?  What's wrong?
ali,Why you done up like that?
sonji,I'm dyin' and...'cause this is how I dress! I dyin' for you out of worry...
ali,"""Worry""...?"
sonji,Yeah. And all you care about is if I look dull enough?
ali,"The world looks at me, girl! What if I straightened my hair, live in the white suburbs? How I am says something!"
sonji," Well, sorry you don't like how I am..."
ali, Where's Herbert?
ali,What do I do...?
herbert,"If you want, have no contact with her for ninety days. Then you make a public statement of divorce in the mosque, and Islamic law will be satisfied."
bundini,"""Satisfied?""...satisfaction is not makin' it with the woman who send you to the moon?"
ali,"Please stay, Brother Herbert."
ali,I ain't dead!
cosmetologist,You got the prettiest eyes...
ali,Yeah?
bundini,"He so pretty, when you look up ""pretty"" in the dictionary, he too pretty to be there."
ali,Huh?
ali,What you talking about?
bundini,Champ.   It's Eskridge...
ali, You know about this?
ali,"...I flunk their draft board test. Now, without testing if I am ""wiser"" or ""worser,"" they decide I can go into the Army."
howard cosell,"Cassius, it is my opinion you..."
ali, And I'm not Cassius Clay. That's a slave name. I'm a free man. I'm Muhammad Ali.
howard cosell," You know, I apologize to you. On the air. Your name is Muhammad Ali. You have the right to be called whatever you want."
ali, You make a lot of mistakes for a so-called educated man. You really go to law school?
howard cosell,"Yes, Muhammad. And to think I gave up a lucrative practice for the likes of you."
ali,"I'm the best thing that ever happened to you, Howard Cosell. Without me you be a tall white man with a microphone in his mouth."
howard cosell, And without me...you'd be a mouth.
howard cosell, Have a little coffee with your sugar...?
ali,Keep talking. You were saying something half-smart...
howard cosell,They want to make an example out of you.
ali,"Why? I'm no Stokely Carmichael, H. Rap Brown..."
howard cosell,"All they are is political. They tell people how they ought to be. But you are the HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION of the WORLD. You're important. And they don't like your militancy, your politics. So, they'll make an example out of you."
ali,"...of a good ""Ne-gro,"" who do what he told?"
howard cosell,"Yes. Or, to demonstrate here is what happens to your ass if you don't..."
chauncey eskridge, You do six weeks basic...you go into the Reserves...you don't go to Vietnam...you get to box...you even get to keep the money...
herbert, The Messenger would not object if you joined under these terms.
ali,I stay out of jail and I get to fight. HERBERT  All you have to do is accept the induction. And life goes on.
chauncey eskridge,They call your name. You say yes.
ali, Yes.
a man," Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Clay, you're under arrest for refusing induction..."
ali," That's a joke, man...!"
bingham,You know what you j-j-just said...?
lipsyte,From Europe to China...every home in America...the world's gonna know what the heavyweight champion of the world said about the U.S. war...
ali,So what?  I ain't gonna be what anybody else want me to be. I'm not afraid to be what I want. And think how I want.
ali, People are following me...
bob arum,"I got almost nowhere I can promote a fight for you. Plus, I think they're going to vacate you from the crown."
ali,What?
bob arum,Yeah.   If you're convicted.
ali,They gonna take away what no fighter in the world can?
bob arum,And New York may revoke your boxing license.
chauncey eskridge,You sure you want to do all this?  Your next three to four years are every heavyweight's prime. And there are few of those years...
ali,What 'bout Terrell?
bob arum,"We'll know if we can fight Terrell in Illinois this afternoon. Terrell's running his mouth. He said if you're called, you should serve..."
ali," Motherfucker. He got a deferment for bein' too tall, or havin' flat feet. Why don't he serve for me? Tellin' me what I should do..."
bob arum, I got to get you some fights.    Fast.
commissioner,You understand we could take away your license to fight Terrell in Illinois?
ali,Yes.
commissioner,Are you prepared to apologize? About your unpatriotic remarks that you made?
ali,Apologize? No.
commissioner,You said that you were the people's champion.
ali," Yes, sir!"
commissioner,Do you think you're acting like the people's champion...?!
ali,"Yes, sir. I am not going to apologize to you. This isn't a courtroom. And I don't have to sit here and answer your questions."
ali,"I ain't draft dodgin'! I ain't goin' to Canada. I ain't burnin' my draft card. I ain't burnin' the flag. I'm stayin' right here. And you want to throw me in jail? Go ahead. I'll do my time. I been in jail four hundred years. I'll be in jail four, five more. But I ain't goin' ten thousand miles to help murder and kill poor people for you. 'Cause if I'm gonna die, I'll die now, right here, fighting you. If I wanna die. You my enemy, not Vietcong or Chinese or Japanese. You my opposer when I want freedom. You my opposer when I want justice. You my opposer when I want equality. You want me to go somewhere for you, but you won't even stand up for me in America, for my rights and beliefs, you won't even stand up for me here at home."
ernie terrell, Tell Clay he can get on after me.
ali,What...?
ernie terrell,Get on the scale after...
ali, What you call me...?
ernie terrell,Only thing I knows you as:   Cassius Clay!
ali, Announce it right here or from flat on your back!
ali,"What's my name, motherfucker?!"
ali, If the court would give me my sentence right now instead of waiting and stalling.
judge ingraham," Fast enough? Your attorney will lodge an appeal. While you're out on bond, I order your passport surrendered. I'll not have you benefitting yourself by fighting abroad..."
ali,Watch now...
belinda," See, you don't need to fight no more..."
ali,"So what's fresh, girl?"
belinda, Everything fresh!
ali, What's the freshest of the freshest?
belinda, Doughnuts just came out...
ali, 645 pounds. I'd still be pretty...but I be fat pretty...
belinda,You don't remember when you met me once before...long ago...
ali, I remember something...   Wha's your name?
belinda,"You know my name! You came to my school, right before you win the title. Interviewed you for the school paper. I was eleven."
ali,You had a long braid...
belinda,"Yeah! You called me little Indian girl, then."
ali,That was you?
belinda,"I loved you then, like all those kids. I never stopped. I still do."
ali,You see the Ellis-Quarry fight?
chauncey eskridge,Yes... We'll be in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals next month. We'll lose. Then we appeal to the Supreme Court.
ali,Ellis the champ? Man. I beatin' on him since we was sixteen. They give Ellis to Joe Frazier? Frazier'll kill him. Then they out of juice. Where's the gate? So they gotta let me fight. I fight Ellis in a phone booth...middle of Times Square...you think that draw a crowd?
chauncey eskridge,"Draw a crowd or not draw a crowd, Muhammad, is NOT going to make a difference with your boxing licenses. They don't want you to fight.  ACLU's handling your case against the New York Boxing Commission. They discovered New York's got actual ex-murderers and ex-rapists currently licensed to fight. But revoked yours...?"
ali,Tijuana? CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE No. State Department refused permission for the one-hour visa. No fight in Tijuana. Look...
ali,Can't fight here. Can't fight outside the country...
chauncey eskridge,"I know people in the restaurant business...want to start up a chain. Muhammad Ali's ""Champ Burger""...""Muhammad Malts,"" ""Fist Full of Fries""...all of that."
ali,Why I want to be in the restaurant business?!
chauncey eskridge,'Cause you need the money.
ali,How much all this gonna cost?
chauncey eskridge,"Too much.    They do that to you, too, you know."
ali, Look out!
customer,"Hey, champ!"
ali,Not then...
belinda,First time? 1961...Sister Khalilah introduced you at assembly. You said you would be heavyweight champion of the world by the time you were twenty-one!
ali,I always tell the truth...
belinda,"I was eleven. I interviewed you for the student paper. You called me ""little Indian girl,"" 'cause I wore my hair real long, in a braid...I told you...""Man, you scribble! You can't even write! You ought to go back to school until you do it better..."""
jimi hendrix," ""There must be some kind of way outta here, said the joker to the thief..."""
jimi hendrix,"""No reason to get excited, the thief, he kindly spoke. There are many here among us, who feel that life is but a joke."""
jimi hendrix,"""But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate. So let us not talk falsely now, the hour it's getting late..."""
chauncey eskridge,...struck out at the appellate level in New Orleans. So we're heading back to the Supreme Court...
ali,Thought we already got turned down there.
chauncey eskridge,I'm petitioning on a conscientious objection basis. Religious belief. We'll petition that your sincere religious belief prohibits you from shooting people. I believe they'll hear that...
ali,"Where the money come from, Chauncey? Herbert tell me I'm runnin' on empty. Put aside ""how do that happen""? Licenses all revoked. No passport. I can't fight here. Can't fight abroad.  And what happen if I lose the Supreme Court?"
chauncey eskridge,It's all over. You go to jail for five years.
jimi hendrix,"""Outside in the cold distance, a wild cat did growl, two riders were approaching, and the wind began to HOWL!"""
bingham,Ellis doesn't belong in there.
ali," Man give him a shot, he took a shot."
bingham,I saw Bundini in New York.
ali,How's he?
bingham,...bad shape. You better get your belt b-b-back... Belinda brings coffee to Bingham...
bingham,"You call your parents, Ali?"
belinda,"No, he didn't. I told them about the one on the way...myself. "
bingham,You p-p-p-promised you'd call them.
ali,"I'll call 'em, I'll call 'em...  May-may! It go in one end and come out the other."
belinda,"You wanna try changing her, for the experience?"
ali,"You so much better at it, mama."
belinda,"That happen, you promise me you put some new people around you."
ali,"I need Angelo, Rudy, Ferdie --"
bingham,"Ali, she's talkin' about ""Brother"" Herbert."
belinda,Where are they when we need them? You got Gene Kilroy droppin' off groceries like charity. Borrowin' money from my folks. So...?
frazier," Norton's big and strong, but..."
howard cosell, Hold on one second...we have a caller. Go ahead.
howard cosell,"Let's tell it like it is. With your court and boxing problems, Muhammad, can you get a fight promoted?"
ali,"I ain't interested in the paycheck, I'd fight Joe Frazier for free in a phone booth in Times Square, if I wasn't broke. I still will."
howard cosell,Did you say you were broke?   How can you be broke?
howard cosell,You've made more money than all previous heavyweight champions combined. What about your management? Surely they have provided for you...
ali,"I'm saying it's time for everybody to quit lying! Muhammad Ali is the champ! I have to, I'll get the fight on myself.  And if they offer me money, I ain't gonna turn it down."
elijah muhammad,"Get me my son, Herbert, on the telephone!"
elijah muhammad,"Mr. Muhammad Ali desires to do that which the Holy Qur'an teaches him against. I am, therefore, suspending Mr. Ali from the practice of Islam. He may no longer appear in temple, pray or teach, or have any conversation with any Muslim whatsoever. Furthermore...he may no longer use the name of Muhammad Ali. Henceforward, he will revert to his old slave name, Cassius Clay."
belinda,Muhammad...?
ali,You can't call me that no more.
belinda,"Hell, I can't. I'm defying them by talking to you. And being with you."
ali,Whyn't you call an ambulance or a doctor?
landlady," Wouldn't let me. Said he knew you...and to call you, Mr. Ali... He's not been out for three days..."
bingham,Bundini!
bundini, Watchu' doin' here? Gimme that short dog!
ali,"What's wrong with you, man?!"
bundini,Nothin' wrong with me!
bingham,A mystery...d-d-d-daylight...
bundini, Leave me alone!
ali,I leave you alone.   You called me!
bundini,That were a week ago...
ali,"What you shame yourself like this for, maaan...?! Why you shame yourself?!"
bundini,Lemme alone!  I'm flyin'! The Sky Chief talk through me. I know the word!
ali,"You know ""low."" You so low, the curb look like up!"
bundini, Yeah? The king gotta go home to his throne! From the root to the fruit...!
ali,Those rhymes is old.    Forget 'em.
bundini, Yeah...
ali, Yeah.
bundini,"Forgive me, Muhammad.    Take me back..."
ali,"No. There's no ""back"" to take you to..."
ali," ...you can't do what you do best in the world. And how you feed your family? From prison? Who take care of your kids? And is Allah, is God with me?"
howard cosell," Don't bother me. I'm a world- famous broadcaster and you're an ex-champion with diminished skills. I can't be seen you, it would be calamitous to my reputation."
ali,"Put me on, Howard. HOWARD COSELL Muhammad, I'd do anything for you. But I got bosses who only give a damn about Nielsen ratings."
ali,I guarantee...it will be a historical and momentous night!
ali,"...what Heavyweight Champion of the World? I'm not the champ. I am retired, finished, out of the game. And I ain't gonna let myself grieve and suffer none. But I know I will not fight again..."
howard cosell,I thought you were resolute in your resolve to regain your crown...
ali,"If tomorrow they say: ""We want you to fight Joe Frazier. Madison Square Garden. Millions and millionses of dollars. Here's your license back."" I will tell them: ""I am sorry, but I am done."""
howard cosell,What about Frazier?
ali,You'll have to wonder...what me and Smokin' Joe would have looked like.
howard cosell,"You surprise me, Muhammad..."
ali,"Howard, you losing your hearing along with your hair? Don't put questions to it!  I am through fighting. 'Cause I got a bigger and more important match comin' up. The U.S. government. A heavier contender. HOWARD COSELL Do you think you're going to jail?"
ali,"I don't know, but it's going to be a shocking and terrible fight. In fact, they might wish they let me stay in boxing."
howard cosell,Joe Frazier told me on this show he would knock you out.
ali,"There you go, agitatin'. "
ali,I don't wanna fight no more.   Not with you...
ali,"Who dress you, Joe?   You look like Dale Evans."
frazier,Shut up.    Get in.
ali,"To be closer to you, honey."
frazier,Fuck you.
ali,There be two undefeated heavyweight champions! And they ain't fighting!
frazier,I wanna fight you! Said it a hundred times. The Man won't let you fight no more. What you complainin' to me for? ALI 'Cause you gotta get behind this and we gotta do this.
frazier,"We...""gotta"" do nothin'!!!"
ali,"You wanna get this on, Joe?     You and me? Or not?!"
frazier,What about your license?
ali,I can fight in Atlanta.
frazier,How's that? What about the Boxing Commission?
ali,"Georgia ain't got no state boxing commission. And Atlanta got a black city council; a liberal Jewish mayor, Sam something. It all set. I do a prelim in Atlanta with Jerry Quarry. But we got to get the steamroller movin' now."
frazier,What I got to do?
ali,You announce that if I beat Quarry you give me the title shot.  So what you say...maaan?
frazier,"My daddy was a sharecropper. I worked in a slaughterhouse...right on that corner. I came up from nothing.  What I got, I got with this. And I already got the title. So I got nothing to win and everything to lose."
ali,But you know you ain't the champ yet.
frazier," All right. You beat Quarry, I'll get inna ring and fuck you up..."
ali, I'm fine. Thanks.
angelo dundee,TIME!!
bundini,"Take me back, boss."
ali,You want me to take you back?
bundini,I'm clean. 
ali, You can't hit what you can't see.
bundini,You the man! You Superman! Ain't no kryptonite in this ring tonight!
belinda, ...you don't need their management...
herbert,As-Saalam Alaikum...Brother Muhammad...
ali,All praise to Allah...  ...Alaikum Salaam...
herbert," The Messenger has lifted the suspension, Muhammad. Congratulations."
ali,"You saying I can be a Muslim again, Herbert?"
herbert,Yes.
ali, I never stopped. Like I never stopped being champ.
herbert,I begged my father to reinstate you.
ali,When? After I promoted Quarry fight? After I won it?
herbert,We can get you Frazier.
ali,I already got Frazier.
herbert,We can get you five million dollars for Frazier.
ali,"Are we talking management, talking money or talking religion?"
herbert,When you...
ali," When I got leery and talked up how come I'm broke, then came the suspension. Now, you explain that to me, my brother...?"
herbert,"It's my father... ALI  I love the Nation, Herbert. I love Elijah Muhammad. But it don't own me."
herbert,My brother!
ali,Yeah...
bingham,You b-b-becoming a Christian? Forgive and forget?
howard cosell,"Muhammad, you T.K.O.'ed 'em..."
ali,"What are you talking about, Howard? Quarry?"
howard cosell, You won an 8-0 unanimous decision. You're free.
ali,I'm free. ANGELO DUNDEE What are you talking about?
ali,Supreme Court set me free.
bundini,"That's 'cause they know the king is gonna go home to his throne. And they know everybody's with you, now. And they wanna be on the RIGHT side!"
announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, fifteen rounds of boxing for the heavyweight championship of the world..."
announcer,"And in the opposite corner, the current heavyweight champion of the world, Smokin' Joe Frazier...!"
ali's eyes,deep in his focused concentration. His attention so arrow like it reminds us of the younger man in the Liston fight...pure purpose.
angelo dundee,"Hell of a fight, champ..."
ali,Shut up! I lost.  Get outta here...
rudy,Go on!   Everybody out!
angelo dundee, It was still a hell of a fight.
ali,Where's Belinda?
pacheco,She fainted... They took her to the aid station. She's okay.
ali,"My hands was in sand, Angie.     My feet in water..."
angelo dundee,"Maybe we shoulda had more time between Blin and this, you know...to get back into..."
ali,"Woulda, shoulda, coulda...  After three-and-a-half years, this...from how far back...comeback is."
press,Were you robbed?
ali,"I lost. You lose, you don't shoot yourself. The world goes on."
another reporter,Joe said he didn't think you wanted to fight him again...
ali," Oh, how wrong he is."
belinda,My God.    They killed you!
pacheco,Get away from her.     What is that?
ali,"I ain't dead, baby!     C'mon."
ali,I can move my jaw with my tongue. He got me...
pacheco, It's broke. I think...I think your jaw's broke.
pacheco,nods to Dundee. Dundee starts to reach. Ali snatches Angelo's hand holding the towel. Angelo's about to end the fight...
ali,Ain't stoppin' nothin'...!  Nothin' stoppin'...!
herbert,"Now that Smokin' Joe's run out of tomato cans to beat up, I finally got Yank to commit to a rematch with you in about six months. Frazier said he'd be happy with three mil... "
ali, Foreman call me one time after he won the Olympics...
howard cosell, DOWN GOES FRAZIER! DOWN GOES FRAZIER!
bingham, B-b-be easy gettin' a Frazier fight now. He ain't the champ of anything except getting knocked down.
ali,So.
angelo dundee,So we only eked this one out. And George Foreman makes Frazier look like a sissy.
pacheco,You see their fight?
howard bingham,You mean the Joe Frazier falling- down lesson?
pacheco,And Foreman is 24. You are 32 years old. I don't want to see your head get turned into someone's bull's-eye.
angelo dundee,"...but, you go? We're the corner, same as always. But it ain't gonna be easy."
ali, You think I still got the tools?
angelo dundee,"You got the tools, Daddy.     But they different."
ali," Well, you better sharpen 'em up. 'Cause we goin' to Africa. BUNDINI The motherland. From the root to the fruit. We gonna rumble...in the jungle."
ali,It's time to be heavyweight champion of the world again.
bundini,"Yeah, man!"
don king,"""Rumble in the Jungle!""     That's the name I given it."
reporters,Don. Zaire? Why not Antarctica? What's wrong with New York City?
don king,"Because you miss the significance. I dream, as Martin Luther King once dreamt, that a man could be judged by the content of his mind. This is about black men helping black men, overcoming four hundred years of racial depression to the dawn of a new day of liberation...financial and otherwise."
ali,"Man, you crazy."
don king,"Ten million dollars. With one stroke of the pen, you split the world's biggest emolumation of the history of sports!"
ali," What are they saying, man?!!!    Why they saying that?"
ali, What?!
ali,"Ali, boma ye!"
ali," Fast. Six left jabs flash from his chest and shoulder, followed by a right hook and left and right uppercuts."
kids,"Ali, boma ye!"
ali," Ali, boma ye George Foreman!"
teenager," You beat them, Ali!"
ali,Foreman?   I kill him!
ali," ...even if I die here. If it kill me, no matter what...I gotta win."
ali,Howard! How many you ugly sportswriters in there got me over Foreman? Don't lie.
howard cosell," Some of us...Norman, me...are worried. How you gonna dance against George?? He's sparring with a middleweight, training to cut you off. He gets you against the ropes, he can knock you out with either hand."
ali, What's the odds?
howard cosell,Two-and-a-half-to-one. Against. We're worried you're going to get hurt.
ali,This'll be the biggest upset since Sonny Liston. I want all of you to write it down! This fight is no contest!
howard cosell,"Muhammad, I'm sorry. I have to ask.  Are you really fast enough, anymore? To beat George Foreman? Many people believe you don't have the same skills, that you are not the same man you used to be ten years ago."
ali,"Howard. I didn't want to talk about this, especially in front of everybody. But I talked to your wife! And she told me you're not the man you used to be...two years ago!"
ali,"Salaam Alaikum, brothers!  The champ is here!"
belinda,Here's your water.
ali,Bottled water. Frozen steaks. Brought all this stuff like Africans don't have steaks...
belinda,You could pick up parasites...
ali,They eat it.
belinda,"You're seeing what you want to see, Muhammad..."
ali,Mobutu eats it...
belinda,Mobutu is taking care of Mobutu and stealing all the wealth and sending it to Switzerland...
ali, So? What's that do with any of why we here?
belinda, We're here 'cause Don King got Mobutu to put up ten million dollars. Don King don't give a damn about Africa. He worse than Herbert.
ali,"Here come ""Herbert."""
belinda,"Yeah. 'Cause where was he when we was broke and borrowing money? And Bundini and all them that ""love you""? Disappeared, is where they were.  All over you when you got it and drop off you when you don't..."
ali,"Money? I do ""money-making"" whenever I want. Money is easy."
belinda, And Don King fit right in...that double-breasted hipster is now a dashiki-wearing rip-off.
ali,Don King delivered the first black- promoted championship fight in Africa!
belinda,"Don King talks black, lives white and thinks green! Why you defending him and ""brother"" Herbert? "
ali,"'Cause clean-cut Muslims parading on the South Side of Chicago don't get this done! I got to put honkeys with connections and bad- ass niggers to it, too."
belinda, And now they got you up against George Foreman. Do they give a damn you could get killed?
ali,That what this is? Think I gonna lose? Puttin' doubt on me?
belinda," I think: why is my Muslim husband letting himself get strung up on a cross...? It means, ""tell me."""
ali,Sure.
belinda,"I'll be back before the fight.  If that's all right, my husband..."
don king, Champ! Champ! George had an accident.
angelo dundee, What are you talking about?
don king,"Got cut. Right above his right eye. His sparring partner's elbow. Split it open, so..."
angelo dundee,Can he fight?
don king,Not for six weeks.
angelo dundee,"Are you tryin' to pull something, Don? Ali wants his title. And he wants it back in Zaire. George leaves, he ain't comin' back. George don't like it here."
don king,"How right you are, my suspicious and short Italian brother. And my fiduciary responsibility to this first all-black promotion is like a garden in the African sun. It must grow! It must bloom! It cannot flower in the gloom and shade of postponement to some dome. Like the Astrodome, the Super-dome, any dome outta Zaire, where it be deprived of light and bled of water. 'Cause what gonna bleed...is money. A hemorrhage of cash.  ...blood on the floor. Double hotel costs. Double travel costs. Airplanes. Food and beverage..."
angelo dundee," What do you expect us to do, Don?"
don king," Muhammad. Find a way to get George to stay. Be Moses in reverse: do NOT let my people go! Stay the fuck right here, in Egypt, if you'll pardon my Swahili."
bingham,L-l-l-lingala.
don king,What?
bingham,Lingala.   They s-s-s-speak Lingala.
don king,Who cares?
angelo dundee, If George goes? You forfeit five million. You crawl back to Cincinnati. You ain't promotin' a charity raffle...
don king," If George goes? George goes, my champion, I will get you Joe Frazier. Ali-Frazier III...the fight everybody want to see. INT. PRESS CONFERENCE"
ali, Truth is...George knocked hisself out.
don king, You bad!
ali,I'm a bad man!
don king,Ain't no doubt about it.
ali,And you tell the same thing to George.
don king," We will reschedule the fight, and to ensure George is ready, we are thinking of postponing from September 24th to October 30th."
reporter,"What about the concert, Don? DON KING That would go off as planned on September 22nd and 23rd."
ali," Uh-huh. I want all helicopters guarded! Private boats. Private jets. I want the airport -- I'm serious -- I want President Mobutu and all his paratroopers. Mobutu and all his paratroopers. I want all of you ""Zaireans"" to be on guard! Watch all strange boats tryin' to slip away! They might be takin' him out."
angelo dundee,The bus station. It's Ali kidding on the square. A serious point delivered not seriously to be taken seriously.
ali,Yeah. Watch the bus station. Watch everything! Elephant caravans. He might sneak out by elephant.
angelo dundee,What you say?
don king,I ain't talkin' to you!
ali, Hey!!!
veronica,I don't think so.
ali,What's your name?
veronica,Veronica Porche.
ali,Like the sports car.
veronica, Yes.
ali,"But with a little something extra.  Veronica, I know you now. C'mere, sit down."
veronica,"Don brought me here, but I'm not ""with""...anybody."
ali,Where you from?
veronica,"L.A. But my people are from Louisiana. We're Creole. So I'm African, French, Spanish, my mother's grandfather was Jewish."
ali, Well...they all came together real nice.
veronica,You know...  What you think?
veronica,"Ali, boma ye."
plimpton type,"...she's an African ""succubus."" Means witch doctor."
bundini,Succubus? Suck my dick. They ain't room in Africa for more than one witch doctor. And that's B'dini.
ali,You been to Hong Kong?   Taiwan? Thailand?
veronica,No.
ali,"I can't go there. All the ladies out there from Indonesia, Japan, Hawaii, India...  The women were so pretty..."
bingham,"'B-b-b-bout Hong Kong, man?!   You know what I heard?"
news cameraman,Champ...
ali, Let's go for a ride.
ali,So why you glad we still here?
veronica,Holdin' this in Africa make people proud. All over the world. They're proud of you. Anybody can fight in Vegas.
ali,That's one job.    I got two...
veronica,Islamic faith help you to that?
ali,"Listen, girl, as a Muslim, I am busted out and failed in the eyes of God. I shoulda discovered Islam at 50! 'Cause I am weak on women. They take my eyes and my heart follow...causing me to be a lovin' husband and a terrible husband...!  ...okay, rest of me, let's go!!"
ali, Faster! Faster!
dundee, TIME!
holmes,You can't lead a right hand.   Not at him!
ali,Why not?
holmes,"Too long...to get it there. Man, I mean, to think you could hit him with a right lead...it's insulting... Nobody would lead a right..."
bundini,I got him! Lock him up.
sadler," Hey, hold up, chump!   Make this chump turn me loose."
ali,"Hey! Look! Look at George Foreman's trainer, feelin' me up on purpose! On the side, to see if I'm in shape!"
irene,Can I have your autograph?
ali,"We'll, you ain't gonna find no fat! Watch out!!"
sadler, Give me that thing!
bingham, Muhammad. Give her an Ali button!
sadler,"No, you ain't.  All right, give my wife an Ali button."
ali,She's gotta put it on.
sadler,"Give my wife one. BINGHAM Bo'dini, you got Ali buttons?"
ali,"""George"" buttons is all I got. In my bedroom! All over the bed! Everywhere! To remind me...of all of ya'. All of ya'! Reminds me of all ya'!"
ortf interviewer, Pardon. Vous tes de l'ambassade des Etats-Unis? Vous avez une prdiction?
ortf interviewer, Excuse me. You are from the U.S. Embassy? Do you have a prediction?
bradley, Je suis avec l'Agence amricane d'informations. Il ne m'est pas permis d'exprimer mes prfrences entre deux citoyens des Etats-Unis.
bradley, I'm with the U.S. Information Agency. I'm not allowed to take favorites among two United States citizens...

belinda,"Hello, Muhammad. Bingham.    Mr. Cosell."
howard cosell, Hi...Mrs. Ali.
ali,When did you get in?
belinda,"Just now. Muhammad, may I have a word with you, please?"
belinda,What is going on?
ali,You know what's going on. 
belinda,But I don't have to have it thrown in my face. I don't have to read about it and have people call me up on the phone about it...
ali,I didn't mean for it to come out...
belinda,"Oh, hell, Muhammad, you got no discretion. You never did. You humiliate me!"
ali,I know that.
belinda,Then why you got to be visible with women?
ali,I didn't mean for it to be...
belinda,"I live with the casual ones.  But this, this...I can't hold it together anymore. ALI I don't want to hurt you. It's wrong. You're a good wife to me."
belinda,Then why do you disrespect me this way?!
ali,I respect you.   I always respect you.
belinda,Do you love her?
ali,I follow my heart.
belinda,"""You're following your heart""?  And what happens now?"

belinda,Neither of us did.
bingham,Belinda?
mobutu, Invite Monsieur Idi to join me now... The Banker? The American?
lieutenant nsakala, Countdown! Countdown!
rudy,"Countdown is on, bro.   Five minutes."
ali,Thanks to Allah... 
lieutenant nsakala, Four minutes!
angelo dundee,Give us a moment. Alone.  Hey. This is my religion!
ali,Why?
angelo dundee,Where you at?
ali, Foreman ain't no mummy. He's knocked out eight out of eleven before the end of the third round. He the most dangerous fighter I ever fought.
angelo dundee,I'd worry if I was hearin' anything else.
ali,And I can't WAIT!
lieutenant nsakala,Three minutes!
angelo dundee,Dance.   That's the most important...

ali,"Motherfucker, you 'bout to discover you ain't nothin'."
clayton,"Ali, be quiet!"
ali, You been hearin' about me for years. All your life you been hearin' about Muhammad Ali. Now you gotta face me.
clayton,"Ali, I'll disqualify you. Now, I want a good, clean, sportsman fight..."
