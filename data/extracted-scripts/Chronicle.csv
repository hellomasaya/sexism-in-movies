matt,"Context.   Andrew, you are...a weird dude."
matt,He's this philosopher I'm reading.

cheerleader,Hi.
andrew,Hey-
cheerleader,"Could you not videotape us, please? It's really fucking creepy."
andrew,"I wasn't, videotaping you, so much as I was just-"
cheerleader,"Don't videotape us, okay, or we'll call security. We see you watching us, we're not stupid, and it's sketchy, so back off."

andrew,Yes.
cheerleader,Turn it off.

costly,"Hey fuck off, you better run to your house, bitch. Run to your house and lock the door."
howard,"The fuck, fuck you faggot- Howard quickly starts crossing the street, and Andrew turns and runs back towards his house."
andrew,"I'm uploading what I shot today...you have to keep a back-up, you know."
matt,"It's here, calm down.    Listen."
matt,"Hey dude, don't follow me around all night."

casey,I have a video blog!   Why are you filming?
austin,"Hey, were you filming my girlfriend? Yes or no, were you filming my girlfriend?"
austin," Okay, good, because I don't wanna have to beat your ass."
austin,"Don't talk back to me. Don't get smart, okay, I'm being nice here. I'm being nice to you.  Say okay."
austin,"Cause I know you were filming my girlfriend dancing. I should break your fucking nose, you know that? You know that, I should beat your ass right now, but I'm trying to be nice. Fuck you."
steve,I'm Steve Kazinsky-
steve,...yeah?
steve,"Haha, yes, that is true. Listen, come on, bring the camera."
steve,Come on.
steve,"Dude, come on, we found something."
steve,Is there a light on that?   On your camera?
steve,Awesome.
steve,Me and your cousin were blazing a little.
steve,"A bunch of people were out here, but I think they've all gone back, now, cause we're like, obsessed with the thing."
steve,"Andrew Detmer, that's right.   I remember you from homeroom, Freshman year."
steve,"Yeah, video footage of me luring you into the woods for gay sex- wait, hey- HEY, MATT, IS THIS IT?"
steve,There we go. There it is.
matt,They all left.
steve,Is it still making the sound?
matt,Yeah.   Did you tell Andrew?
steve,"Oh, Andrew, it's making a sound-"
matt,"Here, listen."
steve,You've got to get really close to hear it.
matt,"We're not going to push you, we just wanna get it on tape."
steve,"We didn't dig the hole, man. MATT Is the sound on the camera?"
steve,"Do you guys wanna go in and have a look, or what-"
steve,Hold your nose.
matt,"Steve, come on, we don't know if it's stable in there- It's probably just the wind, we should-"
steve,"Yeah, really far. It's not a cave, it's like a tunnel- do you hear how loud that's getting?"
steve,"Come on, man. Come on."
steve,Huh. I dunno. I don't believe in ghosts.
matt,-shouldn't have come in here.
matt,"At first I thought this was a solutional cave, but now...I dunno, it's like a lava tube, or something."
matt,"Look at the walls. Look at how smooth they are. It's just straight shot down, I mean, we must've already gone forty or fifty feet- ANDREW  Don't talk about it, you're making me nervous."
matt,You ever hear of Plato's allegory of the cave?
matt,Nevermind.
matt,"Is that, is that showing up on the camera?"
matt,"-changes color, see? It must be reacting to the heat, some kind of exothermic reaction-"
steve,Make it change again!    This is awesome!
black screen.,HOLD ON BLACK.
matt,Ready?
matt,"Okay, ball test.   Take one."
steve,"I'm sorry, oh shit, I'm sorry-"
matt,WE ARRREEE THE CHAAAMPIONS-
andrew,"Ah, shit."
matt,Is-
steve,`In the- penis- the penis-
matt,I thought I heard my dad...UGHHH WHY ME AGAAAAIN!?
andrew,"The trick is to pretend like it's on a plate. You get it on the plate and then you wrap the plate around it, and you can move it however you want."
steve,Mhm.
matt,"I've been pretending I was like, holding it in a fist, like a floating hand."
andrew,Yeah?   Plate's easier for me.
steve,"Guys, check it out."
matt,"That's what I'm doing, it's just, it's hard. You're better at this than me, you do it."
andrew," Really? Andrew points at the lego set, and it flies together."
matt," Dude, holy shit!"
steve,"Guys, listen, listen.   Samantha."
steve,"What would you suggest, as like, a course of action for me, here?"
matt,Why are you asking US for advice on girls?
steve,"-new camera's working out for you, that's good. CUT."
steve,You don't feel like it's a little weird? Like it puts a barrier between you and everything?
steve,Okay.   I respect that.
steve,So how do you pay for your shit?
steve,What about your mom.
steve,"I've actually been having some problems with my parents, too."
steve,"Nothing like yours, though.   Not- Never mind."
steve,"Yeah. I know. I'm actually, yeah, I'm sure my mom is cheating on my dad."
steve,"I just, you know, I saw some stuff. It's weird, you don't think about your parents as like...people, or whatever. I don't know."
steve,Good.
matt,"See last night, alone, I got my whole bed off the ground. No nosebleed."
steve,"Yeah, I was doing weights, too."
matt,"Weights, like-"
steve,"Free-weights, a barbell. I got up to two hundred pounds before I bled."
matt,"So it's, yeah, this is my theory- it's like a vagina. Like it's elastic, but if you stretch it too far too quick it'll tear-"
matt,And that's why we're getting better. We're loosening up.
steve,"No, I like braingina.   Braingina is the shiiiiit."
steve,"If anyone criticizes you, just call them a hater. It's like calling someone a racist, they'll just drop whatever they're complaining about and be like ""I'M NOT A HATER."" Nobody wants to be a hater."
matt,I'm gonna get the gum right out of his mouth- watch this.
steve," GUYS, WHY ARE WE RUNNING!? We don't need to run, we don't need to run!"
matt,"That was a good one, you got that one far."
matt,"What?  Sure, yeah. I mean, I didn't, always-"
matt,"Don't get mad, I mean, I like you now, I like you a lot. You're just, you're not super easy to talk to. You've got a lot of-"
matt,"See, that's what I'm saying. You're hostile, man."
matt,Yeah.
matt," My braingina is having like a...face period. STEVE Yeah, you got some from your ears, too. You've gotta start working it out more, Matt."
matt,"Yeah man, in between my yoga."
matt,Ha.
matt,"That's like, at least twice as much blood as I usually see on a taco bell wrapper."
steve,"Guys, guys. Look."
matt,"-sfucking insane, we just changed her life. We did-"
steve,"That was fucking great. I mean, this just gives me so many ideas, already, stuff we could do-"
matt,"Oh come on, what is this?"
steve,"He's like right on your bumper, too."
matt,Can you fucking believe this guy?
steve,"He's just some asshole redneck, look at him. He's fucking with us."
matt,"I don't know what to do, what should I-"
matt,"Andrew, just stop, just stop doing things."
matt,"Stop, just stop."
redneck asshole,"-what happened, cause...I don't know....my truck, my truck..."
matt,"Yes, just past White Crescent bridge. Down by the- yes-"
matt," Yeah, just come- no, I don't know. I don't know, maybe internal bleeding, or-"
local officer,-looks like he'll be okay. Lucky you guys were here. Is that on? You can go ahead and turn that off. The camera shuts off.
matt,"You don't see how we can be angry? You put a man in the hospital for fucksakes. You put a man in the hospital, you hurt somebody-"
matt,"Which part of that do you mean, do you mean he was being an asshole, or was it an accident? Was it an accident, Andrew, cause you're the strongest. Listen, with this, we can't fuck around, ever."
matt,"NOT LIKE THAT, ANDREW. That's- you can't use it on people, or hurt people like- Steve, help me out."
matt,"We need rules, okay. Rule #1, you can't use it on living things. Rule #2, you can't use it when you're angry-"
matt,I'm not mad.
matt,"...Power corrupts, is all I'm saying, man."
andrew,What does that even mean?
matt,"I just mean that we have to think about things more now, okay? We can't just DO things, we have to think first."
andrew,...I understand.
matt,"It's just- nah, nevermind, we're here."
matt,Steve?   Where are you?
steve,"Just try it, it's easy."
steve,"You throw yourself at the ground. You just fall, and catch yourself, and then it's easy, I swear. Don't try to jump or you'll flip yourself. CUT."
matt,Yeah.    I'm done for now.
andrew,Whoaaaamygod...whoaaa...
matt,"HOLY SHIT DUDE! HOLY SHIT, DUDE, HOLY SHIT! HOLY...SHIT DUDE, HOLY SH-"
matt, What? The wind!
matt,"It's about aerodynamics! If I put a barrier just in front of me, I can go way faster, cause it cuts wind resistance!"
matt,Yeah!   Definitely!
steve,"WOO! HOLY FUCKING FUCK! I COULDA DIED, MAN! I ALMOST FUCKING DIED!"
andrew, Y- yeah-
steve,FUCKIN' AMAZING!
matt,"What happened, are you-"
steve,Ahhhhh!
matt," What the hell, what the hell-"
steve,"This is what people have wanted forever, since like caveman times! Do you understand, I mean do you- jesus christ, I can't even- Everything is fucking great! I CAN FLY! Matt, listen, just say it!"
matt,...I can fly.
steve,Shout it out man!
matt,I CAN FLY.  I CAN FLY!
steve,FUCK.   YES.
hold on black,FOR A MOMENT.
matt,"Yo Andrew, Andrew, gimme a beat."
matt,"That's cold, you're so cold! MY OWN COUSIN! DJ Steve, dial me up- Steve immediately starts beatboxing."
matt,But how does she not notice?
steve,"Well, I mean, she notices that it's gotten better, definitely. You just have to be subtle."
steve,"Pfff, technicalities. MATT Man, I haven't had sex since like...a year."
steve,"Ugh, man, you guys...how are you so cool?"
matt,Liquid nitrogen.
steve,Yeah.
matt,Today was like...the best day of my life. Like I was thinking and I can't think of any day I liked better than today.
steve,Unanimous.     Yes.
matt,Okay...good.
steve,Well that answers that.
matt,"Nah man, we were all- I mean, I was, definitely, yeah."
police officer,"Hey, you kids can't be here, okay? You gotta move on out."
matt,What?
police officer,"The ground is unstable, we're cordoning the whole place off."
andrew,"Well, uh, it would appear that a Virgin Mary has appeared in the maple syrup on a young local man's pancake."
matt,"In a second it will, wait..."
matt,"Well, when I was really little, I wanted to be police officer."
andrew,"Fuck you, pig."
matt,"No, I just really got into on the idea of altruism, you know?"
andrew,What's that mean?
matt,Like making things better for everyone.
andrew,"So what, you wanna do like, a charity? That's lame."
andrew,I dunno.
matt,"I mean, I'm not gonna- it doesn't matter, you know. I'm never gonna get out of this piece of shit town. You know, we're all just little pieces. One person can't really make a difference. I used to think- I don't know. I don't know."
steve,AAH!   DOUCHEBAG!
steve,"I'm not GOOD at everything, I just do my best at everything. That's what it's about. I mean you talk about philosophy and shit all the time, but you never really do anything. Have you even applied to colleges yet?"
matt,I'll get to it-
steve,"You could use some of that, man, I'm just saying."
steve,You lack initiative.
matt,You lack...a dick.
matt,"Shit man, I got my mom's birthday, I gotta go."
andrew,Say hi for me.
steve,Later dude.
steve,"Ah, dude, it's rush hour."
andrew,So?
steve,"Hell yeah, dude."
steve,I wish I could bring Samantha up here. She'd love this.
steve,"Nah, no way. She'd freak out."
steve,"It'll be fine, dude.    You'll figure it out."
steve,"Hey, I wanted to ask you, winter break's coming up...You wanna do the talent show with me? Get you out there, you know, meet some new people."
steve,"Yes you do, you have a talent, you have a talent."
sandra detmer,You look handsome.
sandra detmer,I'm glad you are spending so much time with your friends.
andrew,I don't know what you mean-
andrew,Matt.
andrew,"...I'm sorry, I'll try to-"
matt,Just amazing dude-
matt,"Are you fucking kidding, I've never seen a reaction like that in the auditorium, you guys- it was fucking like- it shook the building. You guys are rockstars."
matt,"Ah, see, here's the first stage of your downfall, hubris."
matt,What?
matt,Seriously?
matt," I'm sorry, I'm sorry-"
samantha,AAAH ANDREW!
matt,Hi Samantha!
samantha,"Everybody's freaking out, you've gotta come in here-"
monica,"Just fucking amazing. Magic is so hot. Do you know, me and my mom, in Vegas, went to a magic show, but they didn't have anything like that."
monica,"Do you not remember me, at all?"
monica,We took American History together.
monica,Yeah!   Hiiii!
some guy,"And now, you get a special treat, I'm gonna film myself taking a piss."
steve," Matt, you have the camera yeah? You have the camera, cause, don't let him forget the camera, okay? That's Andrew's camera."
stoner,"Hey Matt, wanna blaze?"
stoner,"Andrew? He's upstairs in the bedroom hooking up with that, whatshername, hair girl."
matt,"Hey Andrew, hope you're seeing this. Congratulations, sir. I'm drunk, sorry. I was really worried about you, like, before everything, but I do feel like...  But listen when did I become the one who's...who's out alone filming myself, with the camera-"
casey,Hey Matt.
casey,Stockings are why I love Christmas. You wanna get outta here? This place is too loud for me.
matt,"Yeah, I- YES- yeah, just gotta drop off the cam-  Matt fumbles with the camera, turning it off.  BLACK SCREEN. HOLD ON BLACK."
andrew,What'd you...You- what'd you see?
andrew,"I didn't spend any of your money, RICHARD-"
andrew,"School doesn't cost any money, I go to public school you idiot-"
andrew," You asshole, you fucking crazy asshole-"
steve,"We have to get down from here right now, Andrew! This isn't safe!"
steve,"Hung over, dude! You should be too! Let's just-"
steve,"What the fuck are you doing? ANDREW  I'm filming the storm, no one's ever filmed a storm like this up close bef-"
steve,"No, we're getting the fuck down, now. This is fucking crazy, Andrew- what- what happened to your face?"
steve,"Your dad fucking beat the shit out you! Come on, we'll go to the cops, let's get out of here. He can't do that Andrew.  This is not the way you handle it, we'll go together, let's go, he can't do that-"
steve,"I don't fucking care!?    You're my best friend, idiot!"
andrew,...What?
steve,"I hang out with you and Matt practically every fucking day! You think I talk to anyone else about my parents, or my feelings on shit, are you that fucking insecure?"
andrew," I'm an idiot. I'm sorry Steve, oh god, I'm sorry-"
steve,"Dude, it's okay.     You just need help, okay?"
andrew,"Yeah, yes, I don't know what I'm doing-"
steve,It'll be fine. But we've- ...Do you hear that? I hear...singing.
digital,DISTORTION TO BLACK.
matt,No you haven't. Why aren't you returning my calls. Turn off the camera.
matt," You can look that up online, you know, they keep track of it. I looked it up. Zero. And they find him out in a field, why would Steve go out in the middle of a field during a lightning storm?"
matt,What?
matt,"No, no, you do know, you do know, I think you do know."
matt,"What happened, Andrew. Just stop, stop lying to me, and tell me-"
matt,"I don't believe you, okay! I don't believe you, I want you to- put the fucking camera down."
matt,"Because I want to talk to you. Put it down- put it down, Andrew, please- put it down, turn it off, put the fucking-"
andrew, -wanted to show you what I was talking about.
wayne,"What, you got a probl-"
fernandez,Could you put the camera away?
fernandez,"I understand that things have been very hard for you recently, Andrew, but the camera kind of- it alienates a little, you know?"
fernandez," There's concern for your grades, Andrew. And as far as I know you've yet to apply to any colleges, so-"
fernandez,"Well, yes, but I still think it's worth thinking about. There are three different community colleges locally that offer great programs for-"
fernandez, Andrew?
sandra detmer,"Richard is that you? Richard, you have to let me have my medicine, I can't...Andrew? Who is that? Look, please come in here, I need help to turn over. It hurts, please, Andrew, you have to tell your father...tell your father to get my medicine..."
andrew,"I've been doing a lot of reading, like you know, online, about evolution, and the way it works, and you know, natural selection. The uh...  I mean, what I'm trying to say is, a lion doesn't feel guilty when it kills a gazelle. You don't feel guilty when you squash a fly, you know- I think that means something. I think it really means something.  CUT.  Andrew's back out with the car. He lifts it again, then makes a quick ""squeezing"" motion. As he does this, the car violently compresses down to the size of a basketball. Andrew flings the ball of metal into a scrap pile, which collapses loudly.  Andrew falls down onto his butt, a little exhausted, but as he gets up he is abruptly attacked by a guard dog, which bites him twice before he's able to fling it off.  The dog recovers, and rushes Andrew, who raises a hand, blasting the dog across the yard, killing it instantly.  Andrew turns and looks at the camera, and it turns off."
matt,I told you how the interviews went.
matt,"UCONN not so good, Columbia was good, University of Miami was really good, Arizona State was okay."
matt,"Haha, no, I told you they wouldn't."
matt,Nope. Nobody. I flew myself.      I needed the exercise.
matt,"I am so sick of being filmed, you have no idea, Casey-"
matt,When do your parents get back from Spain?
casey,"A week. MATT  Okay, if you don't film me for one week-"
matt,"One week, I'll show you my new trick. I guarantee you will shit bricks. Yeah?"
casey,...Ughhhh.
matt,I'm ready!
matt,Let's do it! Woo!
matt,COME ON!   BRING IT ON!
matt,Ughhhh camera...I had that dream again.
matt,"It's like I'm...I'm not me, I'm something else. And I'm out in this...out in space. And stars are all around me, and I'm zooming past them; everything is really like three-D, I can see the shape of the stars. I'm looking for somewhere to sleep, or something, and I see earth, and I go down to earth. And then...I don't know, just the main part is that I'm out and there are the stars and they just look like millions of little points of light...And Steve is there."
matt,"Yeah but he feels like he's not part of it. Like he's there separately, inside my head. Andrew is there too. I don't know. I'm worried about Andrew.  Why don't you put the camera away?"
matt,Oh I think you know. I think you know what's going down.
matt,"You arrrrreeee...C'mere.  Matt advances on Casey, and the camera falls off to the side of the bed. We can hear her giggling, which is abruptly muffled by kissing.  DIGITAL DISTORTION TO BLACK."
matt,"You haven't been returning my calls, so I thought I'd just...you know, ambush."
matt,"I just- I've been getting, you know, bad vibes or whatever."
matt,"Dude, don't be like that, okay-"
matt,"That doesn't- that actually sounds like the opposite of fine. Andrew, come on, let's get out of here, your room's a mess, it smells like a Denny's bathroom in here."
matt,You're my cousin. You're my friend- it's my responsibility to take care of you.
matt,"...Are you going to break the rules?  We're too strong now, Andrew. We're too strong for that. If you did that, you know I'd have to-"
matt,...Andrew-
pharmacist,"Hello, how can I help you."
pharmacist,"Um, yes, hold on. That's Imuran, Baclofen, Glatiramer and Vicodin."
pharmacist,"Okay, and the copay on that is...Seven hundred and fifteen dollars, eighty three cents."
howard,"You are about to get fucking stomped, you know that right? You hear me son? Come to my house, it's late, I don't see any fucking police officers or some shit, I don't know what you you think you're doing throwing shit at my house-"
costly,"No, wait, what the fuck. What the fuck are you dressed up like that for. Are you high?"
howard,"Lil' Andrew's straight up tripping right now, I don't even know, I'ma give your ass a wake up call-"
costly,"-no, no-"
police detective,"I understand, Mr. Detmer."
police detective,"Yeah I- I'll be outside the door, yeah?"
everyone,-appy birthday to you!
casey,Matt-
matt,"Do you hear that, how can you not hear that?"
casey,"Matt, what hap-"
matt,"The singing, how can you not hear that!? Something's wrong, okay, something's wrong with Andrew, or-"
casey,"Matt, please, okay, you're scaring me, are you okay-"
matt,"No, something's wrong, something's wrong."
casey,"Mom, Matt is-"
casey's mom,Come in here right now.   Come in here right now.
matt,"I see, I know, I have to go, okay-"
matt,Give me your keys.
matt,I have to go to the city.
matt,"I can't fly if there are all these helicopters in the air, I just have to drive there, or, listen, I have to figure this out, Andrew's in trouble. This is my fault.  CASEY  Matt please! MATT PLEASE, PLEASE DON'T GO, I'M AFRAID! MATT I'M SCARED, PLEASE!"
matt,This is all my fault.
casey,No! No it isn't!   It isn't your fault!
matt,"Where are you, man?"
police officer,"Listen, you can't be here, I need you to turn this car around right now and-"
casey,"What's...What is...What's...Matt please, please-"
andrew," WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!? The windshield is TORN OUT, and seconds later MATT IS RIPPED OUT OF THE CAR AS THOUGH YANKED BY A GIANT HOOK, taking his seatbelt with him. CASEY No NO NO"
andrew, No one's gonna help me...No one's gonna help me now...
andrew, What type of camera is that?
sissy,What's happening what's happening-
field reporter,"Are we...Okay, yeah, gimme- two, one- We're live on the scene on Parson Boulevard just south of the center of downtown, and- There's a rushing, screeching sound from around the corner. The camera jerks, and moves towards the corner, the cameraman man running to see what the sound is."
matt,"Please...Help me. Help me, HELP ME, please...I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, I tried- help me, help me, I'm dying, I'm dying. Stars- I see stars, somebody- It hurts, please. I'm- the blood...I tried..."
matt,Would you please...turn off the fucking cameras. CUT TO BLACK.
hold on black,FOR A MOMENT.
