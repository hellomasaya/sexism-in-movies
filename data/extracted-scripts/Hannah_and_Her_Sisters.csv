Speaker,Dialogue
lee,"Hi, how are you?"
hannah, Sweetheart?
elliot, Mm-hm?
hannah, Holly and her friend made them.
elliot, They're fantastic.
hannah, Aren't they great?
elliot,Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
hannah, I know!  I know!
hannah, She has all the cooking talent.
elliot," No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well."
hannah," Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these."
elliot," Holly, why don't you open your own restaurant?"
holly, April and I are going to do some catering!
hannah, What?  You're kidding!
holly," No, no, we decided!"
hannah,Perfect!
holly," we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties."
elliot, Great idea.
hannah, I know.
elliot, That's where your talent lies.
holly, I know.
holly, Could I speak to you privately?
hannah,"Oh, sure."
elliot, I'm her husband!  She tells me anything!
holly,"Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset."
hannah," Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?"
holly,"This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts."
hannah,"Holly, please.  Don't insult me."
holly," Someday, I'll pay it all back."
hannah,I know.  H-how much do you need?
holly,Two thousand dollars.
hannah, Uh-huh.
holly," Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great."
holly," You admit that we're great cooks, right?"
hannah, Yeah.
holly, and some old debts I have outstanding.
hannah, Will you just tell me one thing?
holly, Okay.
hannah,Are we talking about cocaine again?
holly, I swear.  I swear.  We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
holly,"I mean, obviously, I'm not going to be a caterer forever, you know.  We both still go to auditions. Something could turn up at any moment.  But the parties are at night, days are free, I can still take my acting class.  I haven't done drugs on a year."
lee,Mom and Dad are floating down memory lane again!
hannah," Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?"
lee, I think they're fantastic.
hannah, You've outdone yourself.
holly," Oh, my God.  Thank you."
lee," I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so..."
hannah, Ohh?
holly, Uh-oh.
holly," Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning."
lee, At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
holly, Mm-hm.
hannah, Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
holly, Yeah.
lee, Yeah.
hannah,Don't you think she does?
holly,"She really does, though."
lee," Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here."
holly, God.
hannah," Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around."
holly, I should get a garter belt.
lee, Yeah.
holly, Get a garter belt and flirt.
lee, Where are the antihistamines?
hannah,"Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere."
lee, Okay.
holly, Frederick didn't come with her.
hannah, When does Frederick ever come with her?
holly, Tch.  He's such an angry...he's such a depressive.  I thought she was moving out!
hannah," Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!"
holly," Oh, your kids are so adorable."
children, Bye!  Bye!
holly," God, it gets so lonely on the holidays."
hannah," Oh, gosh.  Well, you know, that's why I invited Phil Gammage tonight."
holly," Oh, Hannah!"
hannah," It's, uh, you never know--"
holly, He's such a loser!
hannah,He's not a loser at all!
holly," Oh, he's such a loser!"
hannah, He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
holly,"Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything."
holly, Give me a break.
april, Am I interrupting...
april, ...any sister talk?
hannah, Mm-mm!
holly, Come in.
april,"Oh, good..."
hannah," Come in, come in."
april, ...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
hannah," Oh, listen..."
holly, I know.  It's terrible!
april," I mean, I've looked everywhere."
hannah," Maybe April would like Phil.  Phil Gammage, the tall guy in there by the piano."
april," Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil."
hannah, Mmm?
april,He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
april, I love that.  That's my type.
hannah, I can't believe it!
april," No, really, I really like him a lot."
holly," No, really, we mustn't get discouraged."
holly, Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
april, Mmm.
holly," Not this Thanksgiving, you know."
hannah, Here.  Be careful with those.
holly," Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's."
holly, Ouch!
hannah, Oh!
elliot, Must be here someplace.
lee," Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me."
elliot,How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
lee," uh, sold a picture."
elliot," Oh, great."
lee,"Yeah, it was, it was one of his better drawings, a very beautiful nude study.  Actually, it was of me.  It's funny, you know, it's a funny feeling to know you're being hung naked in some stranger's living room."
lee,"Well, you can't tell it's me, although--  You're turning all red, Elliot."
elliot," Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?"
lee," Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings."
elliot,"Like, uh...?"
lee, I don't know exactly.
lee,"Uh, sociology, psychology maybe.  I always thought I might like to work with children."
lee,"Yeah, sure.  You know, uh, Frederick would really by grateful for a sale."
hannah," Hey, you guys?"
hannah, Dinner's ready.
lee," Oh, great."
hannah, You look so beautiful.
lee, Come on.
hannah, Doesn't she look pretty?
lee,I bumped into your...
elliot, Yeah.
lee, ...ex-husband on the street the other day.
hannah," Oh, yeah?"
hannah," God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?"
elliot," Let's go have dinner, shall we?"
hannah, Mmm.
lee, Good idea.
evan," Now, ladies and gentlemen..."
holly, Dad.
holly,Dad...
lee, Oh...
holly,Dad!
evan," No, now..."
holly,I'm starving!
evan, ...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
hannah, Get his wine away.
evan,This is a toast.  You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...
evan,...prepared...by Hannah.
hannah," Uh, and a little help..."
norma, Hey!
hannah," ...from Mavis, also."
elliot, You bet.
hannah," Holly and April, thanks for helping."
evan," No, you did it."
holly," April, April!"
hannah, I am... I did slave all day.
evan," And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!"
norma, I played Nora.  I hate to tell you what year...
norma, Now I think that Ibsen would have been damn proud of our Hannah!
april, Speech!  Speech!  Speech!
norma, Yea-a-a-a-ah!
hannah, but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
evan, Yeah.
hannah," ...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest."
evan," Oh, bravo!  Bravo!"
lee, Want some coffee or tea?
frederick," No, thank you."
lee, How about something to eat?
frederick,"No, nothing."
lee,Are you sure?
frederick,Absolutely.
lee,God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
frederick, I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
lee,You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
lee," You're too harsh with everyone. You know that, don't you?"
frederick, Isn't it enough that I can love you?
lee, Mmm...
frederick,Hmm?
frederick," when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music."
lee, Mm-hm.
frederick,Have I really taught you everything I have to give?  I don't think so.
lee," Oh, Elliot said he might have a couple of clients for you."
frederick, I'm sure all those morons he handles have a deep feeling for art.
lee, you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
frederick, Because he likes you.
lee, Me?
frederick,Yeah.
frederick, Elliot lusts after you.
lee,Based on what?  You never even see him.
frederick,"Based on...whenever you see him, you always come home full of books he's recommended..."
lee," Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent."
frederick,"He's a glorified accountant, and he's after you.  You understand?"
lee, Ohhh!
mickey," What do you mean, they won't let us do the sketch?"
paul,Talk to Standards and Practices. They think it's too dirty.
mickey,But we showed it to them in rehearsal!
mickey," You know, what'd they do, figure out what the words mean?"
mary,"Mickey, we got a half hour to air!"
larry,We're short!  The show is five minutes short!
mickey,How could it be short?  We timed everything  long.
paul, If we have to...
paul," ...pull out the sketch, then we'll be ten minutes short!"
mickey," I don't know how they can do that to us.  That's-- We go on in thirty minutes, right?"
larry, They're doing it because our ratings are low.
mickey, I got such a migraine.
gail," Hey, Mickey!"
gail,"Mickey!  Listen, we better go right to Ronny's dressing room.  This kid must have taken sixteen hundred Quaaludes.  I don't think he's going to be able to do the show!"
mickey," Why me, Lord?  What did I--"
mickey,You--  Standards and Practices?
ed,"Ed Smythe, yes."
mickey,"Okay.  Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty? "
ed, Child molestation is a touchy subject...
mickey, Could you--
ed, ...with the affiliates.
mickey, Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
ed," Yes, but you name names."
mickey, We say the Pope.
gail, We always say the Pope!
ed,That sketch...
mickey, We--
ed, ...cannot go on the air.
mickey,"Oh, Je--"
writer, Hey!
writer, Who changed my sketch about the PLO?
mickey, I had to make some cuts.  It's four lousy lines!
writer,The whole premise is ruined!
mickey," Oh, you're crazy!  It's not so delicate.  Everybody's married to every line."
gail," Mickey, I can--"
writer, I don't care!  I don't want anyone tampering with my goddamn work without telling me!
mickey, Okay.
writer, You want 'em cut?!  I'll cut 'em myself!
gail," Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen."
gail," In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?"
mickey, No--
ron," I don't feel good, Mickey."
mickey," Yeah, wh-- Yeah, what did you do? Swallow a drugstore?!"
mickey, Look at this guy.
gail, Yeah?
ron, I lost my voice.
mickey," Oh, Jesus!"
gail," Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes."
mickey," Hey, does anybody got a Tagamet? My, my ulcer's starting to kill me!"
ron, You want a Quaalude?
hannah,Hi!  Hi!
mickey, I know...I know.
hannah,Glad you could put in an appearance.
mickey, I got two minutes.
hannah, Very good.
mickey," I got two minutes. 'Cause, God, the show is killing me.  I got a million appointments today.  It just so happens it fell this way."
mickey,"I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--"
hannah," Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you."
mickey,"Happy Birthday, fellas!  Happy Birthday!"
hannah," Guys, look what Daddy brought. Presents!"
mickey," Yeah, aren't you like, you know..."
hannah, Huh?
mickey," ...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?"
mickey, How is everything?
hannah, Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
mickey," Okay, kids, you can open the presents now."
hannah," Here, you guys.  Open them up."
mickey,Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
hannah,He's fine.
mickey,Yeah?
hannah," Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play."
mickey,Oh!
hannah,I think he'll find that satisfying.
mickey," Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think."
hannah,I think so.
mickey,I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
hannah, Yeah.
mickey,The few times that I've met him...  Isn't that a great mitt?
mickey, 'Cause he's a loser.
hannah, Ohh!
mickey, H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
hannah," I know, I know."
mickey," ...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person..."
hannah, That's really nice!
mickey," ...you know?  I, uh..."
hannah," You know, he's been wanting a mitt."
mickey,"You've always had good taste in husbands, so..."
hannah," Thanks, thanks."
mickey,Mh-hm.
hannah, That's a beauty!
mickey,Isn't that great?
hannah,Oh!
mickey, Go right over there.
hannah,Football!
mickey, Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
hannah, Wow!
mickey," Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this."
mickey,See? 
hannah," Hey, d-- Watch, watch the picture."
mickey, This time I really think I have something.
mickey," I mean, I'm absolutely convinced that-that-- You know, I mean, it's not like that adenoidal thing, you know, where I didn't realize I had them out."
mickey," So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--"
mickey, Mm-hm.
mickey,"Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--"
mickey," ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear."
mickey, Now I ca-can't remember.
mickey, Really?!
mickey," No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me."
mickey," I always, I-I always imagine that I have things."
mickey," Oh, uh, about a month ago.  Wha- what do I have?"
mickey," Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?"
mickey," Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?"
mickey,The hospital?  What kind of tests?
mickey," Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera."
mickey,Like what?
mickey," Huh, uh, hello, Dr. Wilkes?  Dr. Wilkes, this is Mickey Sachs.  You have a minute?  I want to ask you a question."
mickey," I-if you have, i-if you have a hearing loss in one ear, and-and it's not from a, uh, virus or a loud noise or anything, wh-what are the possibilities?"
mickey," Uh, right, but-but nothing worse?"
mickey, Really?
gail," Okay, so here's the new pages."
woman," Say, did cards get these?"
gail," No, not yet.  No."
man," Well, let's hope it's good."
gail,"Yeah, really.  Really."
gail,"Eh, we'll be down in a minute, okay?"
gail,"Mickey, what's the matter with you? You're all white!"
mickey,"I feel dizzy.  Sshh, you know, I don't feel well."
mickey,"Do you hear a ringing?  Is there, is there a, is there a ringing sound? "
gail," Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I hear, I hear it."
mickey," N-n-no, not that."
gail, Hello?
gail," Uh, yeah, yeah.  We're going to be working late tonight.  N-no, we'll order out.  It's all right.  Yeah."
gail,"You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em."
gail, But not you.
mickey, Do you hear a buzzing?  Is there a buzzing?
gail," Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!"
mickey, I can't keep my mind on the show.
gail, But there's nothing wrong with you.
mickey, then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
mickey,Like what?!  What?
gail," I don't know.  Cancer, I--"
mickey, Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
gail, But you don't have any symptoms!
mickey, You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
gail,"Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma."
mickey," Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!"
gail,It was on your shirt!
mickey, Everyone was pointing back here.
gail,"Come on, we've got to make some booking decisions."
mickey,"I can't.  I can't think of it. This morning, I was so happy, you know.  Now I, I don't know what went wrong. "
gail,"Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious..."
mickey," No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy."
holly,"Oh, um, those are quail eggs."
holly," Here, try the shrimp puffs.  These are delicious."
holly,I make those.
holly, Excuse me.
holly, Thank you.
april, The Stroganoff is ready.
holly, We're a big hit.
april,"Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit."
holly, You will be.  You will be.  You'll get five jobs next week.
david," Excuse me, are there any more claims?"
holly, Do you like 'em?
david,I can't resist.
holly, Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
david," Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong."
holly,We're actresses.
david,Is this your first job?
holly, Really?  Is the food that bad?
david, Oh no.  Not at all.
april,We need more bread and some baked lasa--  Hi.
david, I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
april," Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crpes caviar."
david,And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
april," Well, let's hope so."
holly,"Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams."
david, Now.
david," Incidentally, I'm David Tolchin."
april," Oh, uh, April Knox.  Hi."
david, Hi.
april, Oh.
holly, I'm sorry.
david, You're Holly.
holly," Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company."
david, Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
holly, What makes you think we're more interesting?
david," Actually, I'm going to listen to Aida, if I'm not getting in your way."
holly, Not at all.
holly," We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried..."
david, I cry at the opera.
april," Oh, I-I-I go limp in the last scene in La Traviata.  Limp."
david, I cry.  It's disgusting.
holly," Oh, what, what do you do?"
david, I'm an architect.
april,Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
david,Are you really interested?
april,Yeah.
holly, Yeah.
david,What time do you get off?
holly," Wow, it's the red one?"
april," Oh, it's magnificent!"
david, Yeah.
holly, It's terrific!
david," The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions."
holly, Uh-huh.
david,And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite. 
holly,Oh!
april," Oh, is that what it is?"
holly," I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know."
holly, Right.
april," It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean.  I-I... I can't put it into words.  The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes."
david," You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  I get the feeling you tune in to your environment."
april, Oh--
holly," Oh, it's really important."
april," What are your favorite buildings, David?"
david,You want to see some?
april," Oh, yeah."
david,"Well, let's do it."
april, Great.
holly," Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown..."
david, Yes.
holly, ...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
april," It's French, though.  It really is."
holly, Yeah.
april, It feels like you're in France.
david, It-it is.  It's romantic.
david, And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
holly, Yeah.
david," They fit right in together.  And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then..."
april, That's just --
david, Look at this.
holly, That's disgusting!
april, ...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
holly, It's really terrible.
david, It's really sad.
holly, And it ruins everything else.
david, It does.
april," Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though."
holly, Yeah.
david, Yeah.
april, A lot of works.
holly, Yeah.
david," Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?"
holly,Fast.
april,"Oh, geez, yeah."
holly, Okay.
david," Uh, who gets dropped first?"
april,Uh --
holly," Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um..."
david, Well...
april," Well, I live downtown."
holly," Yeah, I, we both live downtown."
april, Uh...
holly, It depends on what way you want to go.
april," Well, wait.  You know what?  I know."
holly,Uh...
april," If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?"
david, We could...we could do that.
holly," Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?"
april," Well, sometimes, some, uh..."
holly," I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um..."
david," Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?"
holly, Yes.
david,"Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first."
holly," Oh, okay."
april,Yeah.
david,"And then, uh, April...huh?"
april, Great.
elliot," Oh, my goodness!"
lee," Oh, Elliot!"
elliot,Hi.

elliot, Where are you headed?
lee,"Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol."
lee," Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on."
elliot," Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy."
lee,"Yeah, unhappy and fat.  And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know."
elliot,I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
lee," Oh, God."
elliot, what problems could she possibly have?
lee," Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore."
elliot," A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it."
elliot,Yes?

elliot," Well, i-if-if you have some free time..."
elliot,Thank you.
lee, They have everything here.
elliot," Yes, it's-it's wonderful."

lee, Your book?  You wanted to buy a book?
elliot," I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh..."
lee," Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read."
elliot," Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee."
lee,"No, I don't have time."
elliot," No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I..."
lee, You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
elliot, No!  No...
lee, No?
elliot," Uh, yes!"
lee, Yes?
elliot, Yes.
elliot,Yeah.  How are you?
lee, I'm...all right.
elliot, How-how's Frederick?
lee," Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?"
elliot, Look!
elliot, e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
lee," Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much."
elliot," Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much."
lee," No, I don't think so."
elliot, Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
lee," Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this."
elliot," Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this."
lee," Well, sure."
elliot," And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime."
lee," Well, thanks a lot."
elliot," Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on."
lee, I know you would.
elliot," And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  It reminded me of you."
lee, Really?  Well...
elliot, Page a hundred and twelve.
lee,Bye.
elliot, Bye.
mickey, A brain scan?
mickey, Gee.
hannah, Is there no chance?
mickey, Isn't there anything I can do? Push-ups or hormones?
mickey,"Well, I gotta get a second opinion."
hannah, This is the second opinion.
mickey," Well, then a third opinion."

mickey, I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
hannah, Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
mickey," How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?"
hannah, I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
mickey,"Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies?  Jesus!"
mickey,"Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--"
hannah," Well, what about artificial insemination?"
mickey, What are you talking about?
hannah," You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor."
mickey," What, by a st-stranger?"
hannah,"Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen."
mickey, Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
hannah,I want to experience childbirth.
mickey,"With a, with a stranger?  With a--"
hannah, Just think about it.  That's all I ask.
carol," Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote."
norman," No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for."
mickey,"Yeah...I-I think as, I think as far as laughs, I mean just plain laughs, you know, that was probably the best thing that we ever did."
norman, Mm-hm.
carol," Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm."
norman, We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
carol, Right.
norman, Hmm?
carol," Do you remember that summer in France?  Hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks."
mickey," Yeah, but it was, you know, I guess we had fun when we were there and, you know, it's just, I--"
norman, Mm-hm.
hannah," Coffee?  Listen, you guys, we were-- You want some more?"
norman, Mmm.
hannah, We-we...we had something we-we really wanted to discuss with you.
mickey, Yeah...
mickey," Jeez, this is, this is, this is very delicate and-and I only bring this up amongst friends, you know."
mickey," this is, uh... this should not go any further than this room."
norman, I'm all ears.
mickey, It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
hannah, W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
mickey," Yeah, I'm not so sure that I, that I like that idea myself, anyway--"
hannah," I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that."
mickey," Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and..."
hannah,And you can say no... you know. Feel free to say no.  W-we realize it has all kinds of implications.
mickey,"Yeah, but the-the point that, uh, that we're making here is that we need some sperm."
mickey, You would just have to masturbate into a little cup.
norman, I can handle that.
hannah, Obviously we wou-wouldn't have intercourse.
carol, I've gotta tell you the truth here. I'm a little uneasy about this.
hannah," Carol, I know it's a lot to ask."
carol, Well...I feel for you.  I do. I...I'm gonna cry.  You want my husband to have a child with you?
hannah," Ye-- D-d-d-don't answer now.  Just, you know, take it home and think about it for a while."
norman," I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor."
carol, I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
norman, And maybe my lawyer.
hannah, Now let's move on to another topic.
elliot," Lee, Frederick...say hello to Dusty Frye."
lee," Hi, Dusty."
dusty,Hi.
elliot, Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
dusty,"Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space. "
lee,Oh.
dusty," How ya doin', man?"
elliot," I told him about your work, and he's very excited."
dusty,"Yeah, I got an Andy Warhol.  And I got a Frank Stella, too.  Oh, it's very beautiful.  If you stare at that Stella too long, the colors just seem to float. It's kinda weird."
lee, Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
lee, Yeah?
dusty," I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid."
lee, Uh-huh.
frederick, Do you appreciate drawings?
dusty," She's beautiful.  But, uh, really, I-I-I-I need something... I'm looking for something big."
lee," Big.  Frederick, show him the oils."
frederick, They're in the basement.
lee, Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
dusty," Well, are...are they big?"
lee,"Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big."
dusty,'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
frederick, I don't sell my work by the yard!
lee," Oh, Frederick!"
elliot, How's everything?
lee," Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend."
elliot,"Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods."
lee," Oh, yeah."
elliot, But I go nuts.  It's a conflict.
lee,I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
elliot,"Oh, that's nice."
elliot," I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together."
lee," Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you."
elliot,"Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars."
lee, Oh.
elliot,He's got like six gold records.
lee," Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended..."
lee," ...and the man in the record shop showed me another one that I think you'd love.  It's a... another Bach, second movement."
elliot," Oh, you-you have that one?"
lee, Yeah.
elliot," Oh, I would love to hear it."
lee," Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect."
lee, Isn't that beautiful?
elliot, I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
elliot, Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
lee," Yes, he's just adorable."
lee," They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS."
elliot," Oh, right."
elliot, Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
lee,"Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic."
lee, Did you ever read this one--?
lee,Elliot!  Don't!
elliot,"Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you."
elliot, Oh!
lee, What are you doing?!
elliot, I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.  I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
lee, Elliot!
elliot, I have been in love with you for so long.
frederick, Please forget it!  I don't have any interest in selling anything!
dusty," I ask you if you have something with a little puce in it, you gotta fly off the handle!"
lee, What's the problem?
frederick," I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!"
dusty," Well, I can't commit to anything without consulting her first. That's what I have her for, okay?"
frederick, This is degrading!  You don't buy paintings to blend in with the sofa!
dusty," God, forget it!  Let's just get outta here, Elliot."
elliot, We'll go.
dusty, What's the matter with you?
elliot, Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
dusty, It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
elliot," Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead."
dusty,"Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT  Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead."
elliot, You go.  Go on.  Go.
frederick, Hello?  Hello?  Hello?
lee, Oh!  There you are!
lee,I was looking for you.
elliot," I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up."
lee," Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?"
elliot," Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you."
lee,"Oh, don't say those words!"
elliot," I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible."
lee," Why, you know the situation."
elliot," I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize."
lee,What do you expect me to say?
elliot,Hannah and I are in the last stages.
lee," Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing."
elliot,"Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her."
lee,"Not because of me, I hope."
elliot,"Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you."
lee,"Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--"
elliot," Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway."
lee,Why?
elliot,"Tch, w-well, for a million reasons."
lee, But not over me?
elliot,"Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions."
lee, Poor Hannah.
elliot,"But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?"
lee, I can't say anything!
elliot,"W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad."
lee," Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?"
elliot," O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out."
lee,"Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close."
elliot,"Yes, but you, you do care about me."
lee," Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!"
elliot, Your guilt is because you feel the same.
lee," Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned."
elliot, I have my answer.  I have my answer! I'm walking on air!
hannah, Hi.  How's she doing?
evan, I am glad to see you.
evan,"She's in the kitchen there.  It's the same thing.  Same thing.  She promises, promises.  But it's all lies."
hannah," Don't make it worse, Dad."
evan, Always.
hannah,"Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?"
evan," We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman..."
evan," ...and your mother was throwing herself at him in a disgusting way, and when she found she was too old to seduce him, that he was just embarrassed by her--"
norma, Liar!  Liar!
evan,Then at lunch she got drunker and drunker  and finally she became Joan Collins!
norma, All my life I've had to put up with insults...
evan,I can only hope that she was mine. With you as her mother  her father could be anybody in Actors' Equity!
norma,She's talented...so it's not likely she's yours! 
hannah," Dad, could you just please stay in the other room and let me take care of her?"
evan, You never know when she's going to fall off the wagon and humiliate everybody.
hannah,"Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting."
norma," No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart."
hannah,You promised to stay on the wagon.
norma, his-his-his-his mediocrity!
hannah,"Okay, stop being so dramatic."
norma, He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
hannah," Okay, okay."
norma," Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test."
hannah, Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
norma,"You know, of all of us in the family, you were the one blessed with the true gift."
hannah," Ohhh, my true gift is luck, Mom."
hannah," I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things."
norma,"Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage."
hannah," Now, Holly's not shy."
norma,"No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me."
hannah,True.
norma, I'd have been a great dope addict.
evan," Remember this, Hannah?"
gail,What do you mean you're quitting? Why?  The news is good!  You don't have canc--the thing.
mickey,Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
gail," Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating."
mickey," Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless."
gail, Yeah...but you're not dying!
mickey,"No, I'm not dying now, but, but  But eventually, I'm going to be in that position."
gail,You're just realizing this now?
mickey," Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind..."
mickey,...because it-it's a very horrible thing to... think about!
gail, Yeah.  What?
mickey, Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
gail," Yes, please."
mickey," A week ago, I bought a rifle."
gail, No.
mickey," I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath."
gail," Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us."
mickey,"Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything..."
mickey," I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!"
gail," I know, I know, and your hamster."
mickey, Yes!
gail," Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap."
gail," Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?"
mickey," I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic."
elliot, I thought you weren't coming.
lee,I almost didn't.
elliot, Lee... uh...
lee,I didn't sleep all night.
elliot," No, no-no-no, I'm sure."
lee,"What are we doing, meeting in a hotel room?  It's terrible, isn't it?"
elliot, I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
lee,I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
elliot, I've wanted to call you everyday since I first told you how I felt.
elliot,I resisted so many times.  Don't think badly of me.
elliot,This is not an easy situation.
lee, I know it isn't.
lee,That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
elliot, I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
lee, I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
elliot," Oh, my God."
elliot,"You really do have those thoughts, don't you?"
lee," Oh, all the time."
lee,I know she must be a really passionate person.
elliot, I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
lee, I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
frederick, You're late.
lee," Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten."
frederick, You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
frederick," ""Why doesn't it happen more often?"" Of course it does, in subtler forms."
lee, I have a little headache from this weather.
frederick, It's been ages since I sat in front of the TV... just changing channels to find something.
frederick,"You see the whole culture...Nazis, deodorant salesman, wrestlers...beauty contests, the talk show... Can you imagine the level of a mind that watches wrestling?  Money, money, money!  If Jesus came back, and saw what's going on in his name, he'd never stop throwing up."
lee," Oh, God, Frederick, could you please lighten up?!  I'm really not in the mood to hear a review of contemporary society again."
frederick," You know, you've been very nervous lately."
lee, I can't take this anymore.
frederick, I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
lee," I was, but I'm not."
frederick," When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world."
lee," Frederick, we're going to have to make some changes."
frederick, Like what?
lee,"Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!"
frederick, Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
lee,"Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out."
frederick, Why?
lee, Because I have to!
frederick, What are you going to use for money?!
lee,"I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while."
frederick,"Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?"
lee," Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try."
frederick, Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
lee, No.
frederick," Oh, yes, you have!"
lee, No.
frederick, You've been with someone!
lee, Stop accusing me!
frederick," I'm too smart, Lee!  You can't fool me!  You're turning all red!"
lee,Leave me alone!
frederick," Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!"
lee, I'm sorry.
frederick,"Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!"
lee, I'm saying it now!
frederick,So you met somebody else?
lee, Yeah.
lee," But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!"
frederick, Who is it?
lee, What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
frederick,But who?  Where did you meet him?
lee,It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
frederick,"You are, you are my only connection to the world!"
lee," Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late."
frederick, Jesus...Jesus!
lee," Oh, God, I don't even know what I want."
frederick, Oh...
lee," it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--"
frederick,"Please, don't patronize me!"
frederick,God!  I should have married you years ago when you wanted to!  I should have agreed.
lee," Oh, God, don't you know it never would have worked?"
frederick,"I told you, one day you would leave me...  for a younger man.  I--"
hannah, Where're you going?
elliot," I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman."
hannah, It's so late.
elliot," Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot."
elliot, It's immoral.
elliot," Then, time will pass.  I won't call, and she'll get the idea.  I gotta stop this before I get in too deep.  I'd rather hurt Lee a little, than destroy Hannah."
elliot," Frederick goes jogging at six, yeah, she'll be alone.  And I'll, I'll call her and nip it in the bud."
elliot, Mel!
lee, Good night.
holly,"Oh, why are you making those faces?"
mickey," I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--"
holly," Listen, you are witnessing genius!"
mickey," I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything."
holly," Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!"
mickey," Holly, I'm frightened!  I'm--After they sing... they're gonna take hostages!  Now let's--"
mickey," Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't..."
holly, You want some?
mickey, I don't.  No.  No.
holly," Come on, Mickey.  Come on."
mickey," don't, please."
mickey,"Can we, can we go?"
holly, No!
mickey, My--uh...
holly," I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?"
mickey,Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
holly," Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong."
holly, Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
mickey,Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
holly," Eh, Mickey, it's getting late."
mickey,"Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me."
holly," I'm not angry!  You know, you, well, you don't believe in ESP, you don't like rock music, you won't get high... It's like I'm dating Cardinal Cooke!"
bobby short," ""Why am I Just as reckless as a child? Why am I Like a racehorse running wild? Why am I In a state of ecstasy? The reason is 'cause something's Happened to me I'm in love again And the spring is comin'..."""
bobby short," ""I'm in love again Hear my heart strings strummin' I'm in love again And the hymn they're hummin' Is those cuddle-up huddle-up blues I'm in love again And I can't rise above it..."""
bobby short," ""I'm in love again And I love, love, love it."""
holly,Thanks for a swell time.
mickey," Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing."
holly,I was so bored!
mickey," Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!"
holly,At least I'm open to new concepts!
mickey,"And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?"
holly, This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
mickey,"Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really."
holly,"Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out."
mickey," Yeah.  Me, too."
holly," You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately."
mickey, Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
holly, God!
mickey," ...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials."
holly," Oh, I'll see myself home!"
hannah," Oh, you just have to read the instructions.  I mean, you just set one of these things and you can take, you can take pictures underwater."
child 1, Can I try it?
hannah," Sure!  Yeah.  When we get to the country, we'll try it in the lake."
child 1,Okay.
hannah, Okay?
child 2, Can I go?
child 1, Yeah.
hannah, Yeah!  Okay.
hannah, Are you in a bad mood?
elliot, I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
hannah," Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me."
elliot, Was I?
hannah,"Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat."
elliot," Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea."
hannah,Why not?
elliot, Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
hannah,Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
elliot,I don't know.
hannah,"Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?"
elliot,"But, you got four children!"
hannah,I want one with you.
elliot,Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
hannah,"But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?"
elliot," You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived."
hannah," Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos."
elliot,"I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take."
elliot,"Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about."
hannah, Are you angry with me?
elliot,No!
hannah,"Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?"
elliot, I didn't say that.
hannah,Are you in love with someone else?
elliot, My God!  Wha-what is this?  The Gestapo?  No.
hannah," Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?"
elliot, What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
hannah,Are you?
elliot," But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!"
hannah," What, you, of c-- What are you talking about?  Of course not.  I'd be destroyed!"
hannah," Look, can I help you?  If you're suffering over something, will you share it with me?"
elliot,"Hannah, you know how much I love you.  I ought to have my head examined. I don't deserve you."
holly," Oh, no, not at all."
holly," Well, how about this?"
hannah," Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you."
hannah, Nuh-uh...but I think it's great.  I can't wait to meet him.
holly,He's married...
hannah," ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic."
holly,Sometimes she's terrific...
hannah, Oooo.
holly,"...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean..."
hannah, Oh?
holly,"...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so..."
hannah," You found all this, all this out on one date?"
holly, Now...what should I wear to my audition?
holly," Of course, I'll never get it."
hannah,Singing?
holly," Yeah, can you believe it?"
hannah, Really?
holly," Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh..."
hannah," Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung."
holly," Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?"
hannah," No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing."
holly,"Well...you know, uh...I sing a little, I mean... "
hannah, Ohh!
holly, You know.
hannah, I know.
holly," I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--"
hannah," No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that."
holly," Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song."
hannah, Uh-huh.
holly,Easily.
holly, W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
hannah," hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take..."
holly, Yeah.
hannah," ...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?"
hannah, I hope.
holly," Boy, you really know how to cut me down."
hannah," What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?"
holly," For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!"
hannah," Okay.  I-- What happened?  You know, we were having a really nice time, a-and suddenly, everything went to bad feeling."
holly, Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
hannah," Look, everything's going your way."
holly,You're right.  Why must I let my insecurities spoil everything?
holly," ""This year's fancies Are passing fancies..."""
holly," ""But sighing sighs Holding hands This my heart Understands I'm old-fashioned And I don't mind it It's how I want to be As long as you agree To stay old-fashioned with me."""
producer, Thank you.
director, Thank you.
producer, It was very nice.
stage manager, April Knox?
april," ""Someday When I'm awfully low When the world is cold I will get a glow Just thinking of you And the way you look Tonight..."""
holly,"I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised."
april," Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money."
holly,"Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health."
april,"Oh, uh, listen, David called me up."
holly, What?
april, I didn't know what to say.
holly, You're joking.
april,"No, he called late last night."
holly," I, uh, I'm very surprised."
april, He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
holly," And you, you-you're going?"
april,"Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me."
holly, But I'm seeing him.
april, he said it was something he really felt like doing.
holly, I...I don't know what to say.
april,"Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?"
april, Huh?
father flynn, Now why do you think that you would like to convert to Catholicism?
mickey,"Well, uh, because, y-you know, I gotta have something to believe in, otherwise life is just meaningless."
father flynn, I understand.  But why did you make the decision to choose the Catholic faith?
mickey," Tch.  Well, y-you know...first of all, because it's a very beautiful religion.  It's very well structured. Now I'm talking now, incidentally, about the-the, uh, against-school- prayer, pro-abortion, anti-nuclear wing."
father flynn, So at the moment you don't believe in God.
mickey, then I don't think life is worth living.
father flynn, It means making a very big leap.
mickey," Yes, well, can-can you help me?"
mother," Why?  Oh, my God!"
mickey, I thought that you would be happy.
father, How can we be happy?
mickey," Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought."
father, But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
mickey, You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
mickey," I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try."
father, But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
mickey," So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision."
father,"But why Jesus Christ?  Why, for instance, shouldn't you become a Buddhist?"
mickey," A Bud--?  That's totally alien to me.  Look, you're getting on in years, right?  Aren't you afraid of dying?"
father, Why should I be afraid?
mickey, Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
father, So?
mickey, That thought doesn't terrify you?
father," Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead."
mickey, I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
father, Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
mickey," Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!"
father, How do you know?
mickey,"Well, it certainly doesn't look promising."
father, Who knows what'll be?
father," I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious."
mickey," Mom, come out!"
mother," Of course there's a God, you idiot! You don't believe in God?"
mickey, What-- Just on a simplistic level. Why-why were there Nazis?
mother," Tell him, Max."
father, How the hell do I know why there were Nazis?  I don't know how the can opener works.
lee, Hi.
hannah,Hi.  Where's Holly?
lee, Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
hannah," Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?"
lee," Oh, God, you know Holly.  When she's depressed, she's manic.  I think it was a good idea that we invited her to lunch."
hannah, I hope you tell her it was your idea...
lee,Why?
hannah," ...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive."
lee," Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all."
hannah, So how are you?
lee,"Oh, me, I'm okay."
hannah, Do you miss Frederick?
lee,No.
hannah," I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--"
lee, How are you?
hannah, I'm okay.
lee," I mean, Elliot."
hannah, Y-yeah.
hannah," He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months."
lee, Really?
hannah,Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
lee, Oh...
hannah," I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions."
lee, Like what?
hannah," I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but..."
lee," Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that."
hannah," Hey, hi!"
holly," Well, I just came from an audition..."
lee, Hi.
holly, ...which I did not get.
hannah, Awwww...
holly, So what's new?
hannah, Boy--
holly," They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means."
hannah,"Oh, what do they know?"
holly, But guess who was there auditioning?
lee,April?
hannah," Oh, gosh."
holly,You got it.
holly, I said hello.
lee,"Hmm.  I never trusted April, you know.  She has eyes in the back of her head."
holly,"Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe."
lee, Hmm.
hannah,"Oh, God..."
hannah," Well, that...th-that's fine."
holly," I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even."
holly,I've picked up a lot about dramatic structure from doing my scenes in acting class.
hannah," Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively..."
holly," Well-well, like what?"
hannah,"Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?"
holly," Yeah, that's clerical."
hannah,"No.  She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  That-that can lead to other things."
holly," Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging."
hannah," I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, ""Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer.""  I mean--"
holly," Yeah, you mean not at my age."
lee," Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?"
holly, What's to eat?
lee, Boy...Holly...Holly.
holly," You really think I'm a loser, don't you?"
hannah, What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
lee," You are, Holly.  Stop it."
holly, You treat me like a loser.
hannah, How?
holly,You never have any faith in my plans.  You always undercut my enthusiasm.
hannah,"Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice."
holly, Hmm!
hannah, I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
holly," Uh, losers!  All losers!"
hannah,You're too demanding.
holly," You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!"
hannah, You're crazy!  That's not true.
holly," Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre."
lee," Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!"
lee, She's going through a really rough time right now.
holly, Why are you so upset?
holly," What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?"
hannah, You want to write?  Write.
holly, What's the matter?
hannah, Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
holly, Good.
hannah," Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play."
hannah, You look pale.  You okay?
lee," I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache."
hannah, Yeah?
lee, I think we need to eat.
elliot," I-I can't seem to take action. I'm-I'm like, uh, Hamlet unable to kill his uncle."
elliot," I want Lee, but I can't harm Hannah. And in no other area am I a procrastinator."
elliot,But it's my fault.
elliot," For all my education, accomplishments, and so-called wisdom...I can't fathom my own heart."
krishna leader,What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
mickey," Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me."
krishna leader,"Yeah, well, what's your religion?"
mickey," Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--"
krishna leader," Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?"
krishna leader, Take our literature...
mickey, Uh-huh.
krishna leader,"...read it over, and think about it."
mickey," Well, okay.  Thank you very much."
krishna leader,You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
holly," Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Well, we'll talk at Thanksgiving.  Bye-bye."
evan," Now, here...here's a song that Norma sang on that trip we made up to the show in Buffalo.  And, oh, was she beautiful that night!"
norma,Come on. 
evan," She was so beautiful...she was so beautiful that when men saw her walking along the streets, they'd drive their cars right up on the sidewalk."
evan," Isn't that right, honey, eh?"
norma, A slight exaggeration.
evan, I know.
norma, But only slight.
elliot, You've been very cold to me tonight.
lee, No.
elliot,Is something wrong?
lee, There are too many people around.
holly," Hey, Hannah?  You know, I think Lee is really serious about her new boyfriend.  Yeah, eh, from what I understand he sounds really nice."
holly,I'm so happy for her.  I think she's in love.
holly," Hey, what's the matter?"
hannah, I'm real upset about what you wrote.
holly,My script?
hannah,It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
holly,"Oh, so loosely."
hannah," No, not ""Oh, so loosely""!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?"
holly, Well--
hannah," Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?"
holly," Well, it's a made-up story."
hannah," No, it's real exact!  The-the situations, the dialogue, everything. It's-it's full of intimate details between Elliot and me! Which I don't, I don't see how you could even possibly know about.  A conversation we once had about adoption?"
holly, I just took the essence and I blew it up into drama.
hannah,I don't see how Lee could know about these things.  I don't!  I don't tell her everything.
holly," Wow, I guess I hit a nerve."
hannah," You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?"
holly," Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. ""You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."""
hannah," You're grateful, but you resent me."
holly," Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong."
holly, Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
hannah," Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!"
holly," Well, why don't you share them with us?"
hannah, I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
holly, That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
hannah, I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
holly," No, he hasn't.  If I offended you, I'm sorry."
lee," It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore."
elliot, I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
lee," Look, I'm just as much at fault."
elliot, If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
lee,I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else.  I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
lee," It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know."
elliot," Yeah, but we-we made so many plans."
lee," Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else."
lee, Dinner soon?
mavis,About fifteen minutes.
lee, Uh-huh.  Good.
elliot,And you're in love overnight?
lee,"I care a great deal about him, yes."
elliot, Lee...
lee," Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!"
norma," Sweetheart, I loved your script.  I thought it was so clever."
holly," Well, you're my mother.  Not everybody's gonna be such a sucker."
norma, I particularly liked the character of the mother.  Just a boozy old flirt with a filthy mouth.
norma,I'm so proud!
holly,"Oh, Mom, thanks."
uncle," Now here's a toast to Thanksgiving, all right?"
uncle,Are we supposed to have beer? Yeeeah!
uncle," How's that, Fletcher?"
uncle, Come on.  Bottoms up.
hannah, Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
elliot, Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
elliot," Look, I've got a splitting headache and I don't like being accused."
hannah," Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?"
elliot,No.
hannah," Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?"
elliot," You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less."
elliot," Hannah, I am very mixed up!  Now please!"
hannah, Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
elliot," Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke."
hannah," Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?"
elliot," Leave me alone, can you?!"
elliot," Jesus, I've told you.  I need someone I can matter to."
hannah, You matter to me.  Completely.
elliot, It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
hannah," But, look...I-I have enormous needs."
elliot," Well, I can't see them, and neither can Lee or Holly!"
hannah, It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
elliot, You're not lost.
elliot,I love you so much.
mickey," Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together."
holly, I remember you.
mickey," Yes, you do recall, right?"
holly, I recall you.
mickey, I was walking past and I saw you in here...
holly, Yeah.
mickey,"...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh..."
holly, We didn't hit it off.
mickey," Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots."
holly,How are you?
mickey,Good.  How are you?
holly,I'm fine.
mickey, You look wonderful.
holly," Oh, no."
mickey," Yeah, really.  You do.  You do."
holly,Yeah?
mickey,It was a terrible evening.
holly,"Yeah, it was."
holly, I'd never do that.
mickey, ...in a really horrible way.
holly," Oh, well, that was a long time ago."
mickey, You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
holly, People change...you know.
mickey," Well, I hope you've changed."
holly,"Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired..."
holly," Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed."
mickey, ...namely a personality.
mickey,So how are you?
holly, I'm okay.
mickey,You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
holly,"Oh, nothing much.  You know..."
mickey, Well...
holly," ...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all."
mickey, Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
holly, Probably not.
mickey,"Are you, are you out of work or something?"
holly,"No, well...I've been trying to write."
mickey,Have you?
holly, Yeah.
mickey,"Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?"
holly," Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this."
mickey," No, you can tell me."
holly,Come on.
mickey,"No, I am.  I am."
holly," Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, ""Hey, I have something I just wrote,"" right?"
mickey,Nobody ever said it.
holly,Really?
mickey," Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?"
mickey," Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would."
holly," No, the reason I ask is--"
mickey, You've always hated my taste in the past.
holly," No, I haven't."
mickey,You have.
holly," I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--"
mickey," I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year."
holly,You're kidding me.
mickey, I've done no television whatsoever. No.
mickey," I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year..."
holly, Oh.  Oh.
mickey," ...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it.  But--"
holly," You're okay, though, huh?"
mickey,"I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?"
holly," Oh, I'm fine."
mickey,What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
holly," Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion."
mickey," You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing."
holly," But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script."
mickey,Hmm.
holly," Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh..."
mickey,Yeah.
holly,"...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--"
mickey," Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote."
holly,"Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know."
mickey,Really?
holly,"So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one."
holly," Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?"
mickey, Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
mickey,You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
holly, Maybe.
mickey," Well, what about me?"
holly," Oh, well."
mickey," I should have kept going.  I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and..."
mickey, ...and not begun this conversation.
holly," ""Emily: I'm two high pair, maybe even aces up.  The problem is, you've got three deuces."""
holly,That's the end.
holly,"No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think."
mickey, It was-- I just thought it was great.
holly, Really?
mickey," Yes!  I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?"
holly," Oh, it just came to me one day."
mickey," Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know..."
holly," Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?"
mickey," I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but..."
holly, Right.
mickey, It was fabulous.
holly, Oh!
mickey," Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed."
holly," Oh, God!"
mickey, I am.  You-you made my day.
holly," Oh, wow!"
mickey," It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff."
holly," Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh..."
mickey," I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it."
holly," Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life."
mickey," Oh, who cares?"
holly," God, you really liked it?!"
holly," Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now."
mickey,Well...  One day about a month ago...
holly, that's this.
mickey," Oh, yeah?  What?"
holly," That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself."
mickey,"Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous."
holly, It's all right.
mickey,"I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- "
mickey,"So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or..."
holly,"Sure.  Sure, uh, yes."
mickey," Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?"
holly,Yeah.
evan," Oh, there it is."
hannah," It's on the table, Dad."
evan," Hey, where's Holly?  She's late."
lee," Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed."
hannah," I know, she...she really writes good dialogue."
lee, Yeah.  I'll get some ice.
norma,"Hannah, can I tell everybody you're going to play Desdemona?"
norma," Yes, but it's public television. And to me, Shakespeare doesn't get any greater than Othello.  You with some big black stud!  I love it!"
hannah," Oh, Mom!"
evan," Oh, honey!"
holly,"I didn't miss dinner, did I?"
children, No!
holly," Huh?  Hi, Marge."
holly,Happy Thanksgiving.
holly, Hello.
holly, It's beautiful.
mickey, Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.
holly, Hi.
mickey,Hi.  How you doin'?
holly, Okay.
mickey,When'd you get here?
holly,Just a few minutes ago.
mickey,Oh.  You look so beautiful.
holly,Thanks.
mickey," married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a..."
holly, Tch.
mickey, I don't know how you're gonna top that.
holly, Mickey?
mickey," Mmm, what?"
holly,I'm pregnant.
