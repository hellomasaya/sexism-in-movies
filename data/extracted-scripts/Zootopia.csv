story by,"Byron Howard, Rich Moore, Jared Bush, Jim Reardon, Josie Trinidad, Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee"
young judy,"Blood, blood, blood!"
astronaut sheep,"Yeah, I don't have to cower in a herd anymore."
actuary jaguar,I don't have to be a lonely hunter any more.
actuary,Today I can hunt for tax exemptions. I'm gonna be an actuary!
young judy,And I can make the world a better place! I am going to be...
gideon grey,Bunny cop. That is the most stupidest thing I ever heard.
young judy,It may seem impossible to small minds--  I'm looking at you Gideon Grey.
stu hopps,"Judy, you ever wonder how your mom and me got to be so darn happy?"
young judy,Nope.
stu hopps,"Well, we gave up on our dreams and we settled, right Bon?"
bonnie hopps,"Oh yes, that's right, Stu. We settled hard."
stu hopps,"See, that's the beauty of complacency, Jude. If you don't try anything new, you'll never fail."
young judy,"I like trying, actually."
bonnie hopps,"What your father means, hon, is it's gonna be difficult-- impossible even-- for you to become a police officer."
stu hopps,Right. There's never been a bunny cop.
bonnie hopps,No.
stu hopps,Bunnies don't do that.
bonnie hopps,Never.
stu hopps,Never.
young judy,Oh. Then I guess I'll have to be the first one. Because I am gonna make the world...  A better place!
stu hopps,"OR... um, heck, you wanna talk about making the world a better place--"
bonnie hopps,"Yes! Your dad, me, your 275 brothers and sisters-- we're changing the world."
stu hopps,Yep.
bonnie hopps,One carrot at a time...
stu hopps,Amen to that. Carrot farming is a noble profession.
bonnie hopps,"You get it. I mean, it's great to have dreams."
stu hopps,"Yeah, just as long as you don't believe in em too much.  Where in the heck'd she go?"
gideon grey,"Gimme your tickets right now, or I'm gonna kick your meek little sheep butt."
sharla,"Ow! Cut it out, Gideon!"
gideon grey,"Baa-baa. What're ya gonna do, cry?"
gideon grey,"Nice costume, loser. What crazy world are you living in where you think a bunny could be a cop?"
young judy,Kindly return my friends' tickets.
gideon grey,"Come and get `em.... But watch out, `cause I'm a fox-- and like you said in your dumb little stage play, us predators used to eat prey. And that killer instinct's still in our Dunnahh."
gideon grey,"Don't tell me what I know, Travis."
young judy,"You don't scare me, Gideon."
gideon grey,You scared now?
gideon grey,"Cry little baby bunny. Cry, cry --"
sharla,"Are you okay, Judy?"
young judy,"Yeah... Yeah, I'm okay."
sharla,Wow! You got our tickets!
sharla,Yeah! That Gideon Grey doesn't know what he's talkin' `bout.
young judy,"Well, he was right about one thing..."
major friedkin,"Listen up Cadets! Zootopia has 12 unique ecosystems within its city limits-- Tundra Town, Sahara Square, Rainforest District, to name a few. You're gonna have to master all of them before you hit the streets-- or guess what?  You'll be dead!"
lionheart,"As Mayor of Zootopia, I am proud to announce that my Mammal Inclusion Initiative has produced its first police academy graduate."
bellwether,Oh! Yes right.
lionheart,Thank you.
bellwether,"Congratulations, Officer Hopps."
judy,I won't let you down. This has been my dream since I was a kid.
bellwether,"Ya know, it's a... It's a real proud day for us little guys."
lionheart,"Bellwether, make room will ya? Come on."
bonnie hopps,"We're real proud of you, Judy."
stu hopps,"Yeah. Scared, too."
bonnie hopps,Yes.
stu hopps,"Really, it's kind of a proud-scared combo. I mean, Zootopia. It's so far a away... It's such a big city."
judy,Guys-- I've been working for this my whole life.
bonnie hopps,"We know. And we're just a little excited for you, but terrified."
judy,The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
stu hopps,"And also bears. We have bears to fear, too. To say nothing of lions, and wolves..."
bonnie hopps,Wolves?
stu hopps,...weasels...
bonnie hopps,You play cribbage with a weasel.
stu hopps,"And he cheats like there's no tomorrow. You know what, pretty much all predators-- and Zootopia's full of `em."
bonnie hopps," Oh, Stu."
stu hopps,And foxes are the worst.
bonnie hopps," Actually, your father does have a point there. It's in their biology. Remember what happened with Gideon Grey."
judy,"When I was 9. Gideon Grey was a jerk, who happened to be a fox. I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks."
stu hopps,"Sure. Yeah, we all do. Absolutely. But just in case, we made you a little care package to take with you."
bonnie hopps,And I put some snacks in there.
stu hopps,This is fox deterrent.
bonnie hopps,Yeah that's safe to have there.
stu hopps,This is fox repellent...
bonnie hopps,"Okay, the deterrent and the repellent. That's all she needs."
stu hopps,Check this out!
bonnie hopps,"Oh for goodness sake. She has no need for a fox taser, Stu."
stu hopps,Oh c'mon. When is there not a need for a fox taser?
judy,"Okay, look-- I will take this to make you stop talking."
stu hopps,Terrific! Everyone wins!
train conductor,Arriving-- Zootopia Express!
judy,OK. Gotta go. Bye!
bonnie hopps,"Love you, too!"
stu hopps,"Oh cripes, here come the waterworks."
bonnie hopps,"Oh Stu, pull it together."
judy,Bye everybody!
cotton,"Bye, Judy! I love you!"
judy,Bye!
gazelle,I am Gazelle. Welcome to Zootopia!
dharma armadillo,"And welcome to the Grand Pangolin Arms. ""Luxury Apartments with Charm."""
hopps,Thank you!
kudu pootosser,Yeah? Well we're loud.
oryx pootosser,Don't expect us to apologize for it.
hopps,Greasy walls... rickety bed...
hopps,Crazy neighbors...  I love it!
leopard,C'mon! He bared his teeth first.
clawhauser,O-M goodness! They really did hire a bunny. What?! 
hopps," Ooo, uh, you probably didn't know, but a bunny can call another bunny ""cute,"" but when other animals do it, it's a little..."
clawhauser," I am so sorry. Me, Benjamin Clawhauser, the guy everyone thinks is just a flabby, donut-loving cop, stereotyping you...?"
hopps,"It's okay-- oh, you've actually you've actually got a-- there's a-- in your neck-- the fold-- the-- there's--"
clawhauser,"Oh, there you went, you little dickens!"
hopps," I should get to roll call, so... which way do I?"
clawhauser,Oh! Bullpen's over there to the left.
hopps,"Great, thank you!"
clawhauser, Aw... That poor little bunny's gonna get eaten alive.
hopps,Hey. Officer Hopps. You ready to make the world a better place?
bogo,"All right, all right. Everybody sit."
hopps,"Parking duty?  Uh, Chief? Chief Bogo?"
bogo,So.
hopps,"So I can handle one. You probably forgot, but I was top of my class at the academy."
bogo,Didn't forget. Just don't care.
hopps,"Sir, I'm not just some ""token"" bunny."
bogo,"Well, then writing a hundred tickets a day should be easy."
hopps,100 tickets...? I'm not gonna write 100 tickets... I'm gonna write 200 tickets! 
hopps,Boom! 200 tickets before noon.
hopps, Where'd he go...
nick,"I'm not looking for any trouble either, sir. I simply want to buy a Jumbo Pop for my little boy."
hopps, I'm such a...
nick,"Uh, no no, there are. There are. It's just, my boy--  --this goofy little stinker-- he loves all things elephant. Wants to be one when he grows up."
elephant,You're holding up the line.
hopps,Actually...  I'm an officer. Just had a quick question. Are your customers aware they're getting snot and mucous with their cookies and cream?
hopps,"Well, I don't wanna cause you any trouble, but I believe scooping ice cream with an un-gloved trunk is a Class 3 Health Code Violation..."
nick,A Jumbo Pop. Please.
hopps,A Jumbo Pop.
nick,"Thank you so much.  Thanks, anyway."
hopps,Keep the change.
nick,"Officer, I can't thank you enough. So kind, really, can I pay you back?"
hopps,"Oh no, my treat-- it just-- y'know, it burns me up to see folks with such backward attitudes toward foxes. I just wanna say, you're a great dad and just a... a real articulate fella."
nick,"Ah, well, that is high praise. It's rare that I find someone so non- patronizing... Officer..."
hopps, Hopps. Mr...
nick,Wilde. Nick Wilde.
hopps," And you little guy, you want to be an elephant when you grow up... you be an elephant-- because this is Zootopia, anyone can be anything."
nick,"Ah, boy, I tell him that all the time. All right here ya go--  Two paws. Yeah. Oh, look at that smile, that's a happy birthday smile! All right, give her a little bye-bye toot toot."
hopps,"Toot, toot!"
nick,Bye now!
hopps,Goodbye!
hopps,"Oh! Hey, little toot toot--"
nick,Pawpsicles! Get your pawpsicles!
nick,Lumber delivery!
nick,The color? Uh... It's redwood.
nick,"39...40. There you go. Way to work that diaper, big guy. Hey, no kiss bye-bye for daddy?"
finnick," You kiss me tomorrow, I'll bite your face off. Ciao."
hopps,"Well. I stood up for you, and you lied to me. You liar!"
nick,"It's called a hustle, sweetheart. And I'm not the liar, he is."
hopps,Hey!
nick,"Really, for what?"
hopps,"Gee I don't know, how `bout selling food without a permit, transporting undeclared commerce across borough lines, false advertising..."
nick,Permit. Receipt of declared commerce. And I didn't falsely advertise anything. Take care.
hopps,You told that mouse the popsicle sticks were redwood!
nick,"That's right. ""Red wood."" With a space in the middle. Wood that is red.  You can't touch me, Carrots, I been doing this since I was born."
hopps,You're gonna wanna refrain from calling me Carrots...
nick,"My bad. I just naturally assumed you came from some little carrot- choked podunk, no?"
hopps," Ah, no. Podunk is in Deerbrooke County, and I grew up in Bunnyburrow."
nick,"Okay. Tell me if this story sounds familiar:  Nave little hick with good grades and big ideas decides, ""Hey lookit me, I'm gonna move to Zootopia-- where Predators and Prey live in harmony and sing Kumbaya!"" Only to find-- whoopsie, we don't all get along. And that dream of becoming a big city cop? Double whoopsie! She's a meter maid. And whoopsie number threesie-- NO ONE cares about her or her dreams. And soon enough those dreams die and our bunny sinks into emotional and literal squalor living in a box under a bridge. Til finally she has no choice but to go back home with that cute, fuzzy wuzzy little tail between her legs to become-- you're from Bunnyburrow, is that what you said?-- so how `bout a carrot farmer... That sound about right?"
hopps, Hey! Hey! No one tells me what I can or can't be! Especially not some jerk who never had the guts to try to be anything more than a popsicle hustler!
nick,"Alright look, everyone comes to Zootopia thinking they can be anything they want. Well you can't. You can only be what you are. "
hopps,I am NOT a dumb bunny.
nick,Right. And that's not wet cement.
hopps,"Oh hey, it's my parents!"
bonnie hopps,Aw there she is! Hi sweetheart!
stu hopps,"Hey there, Jude the Dude! How was your first day on the force?"
hopps,It was real great.
bonnie hopps,Yeah? Everything you ever hoped?
hopps,Mmm. Absolutely. And more. Everyone's so nice. And I feel like I'm really making a difference--
stu hopps," Hey, wait a second. Holy cripes, Bonnie! Look at that!"
bonnie hopps," Oh my sweet heaven-- Judy, are you a meter maid?"
hopps," Oh this? No! Oh, no no! This is just a temporary thing--"
bonnie hopps,It's the safest job on the force!
stu hopps,"Ah, she's not a real cop! Our prayers have been answered!"
bonnie hopps,Glorious day!
stu hopps,"Meter maid, meter maid!"
hopps,Dad! Dad--
stu hopps,"Meter maid, meter maid!"
hopps,"DAD! You know what-- it's been a really long day, I should really--"
bonnie hopps,That's right. You get some rest!
stu hopps,Those meters aren't gonna maid themselves.
bonnie hopps,Bye bye!
hopps, Buh-bye.
hopps, Tomorrow's another day...
moose,I was 30 seconds over!
hippo child,My mommy says she wishes you were dead.
hopps, I am a real cop. I am a real cop. I am a real cop. I am a real cop...
hopps," Sir, if you have a grievance, you may contest your citation in traffic court."
frantic pig,"What're you talking about? My shop! It was just robbed! Look, he's getting away! Well are you a cop or not?"
hopps," Oh, yes! Yes! Don't worry, sir, I got this!"
hopps,Stop! Stop in the name of the law!
duke weaselton,"Catch me if you can, Cottontail!"
mchorn,"This is Officer McHorn, we got a 10-"
hopps,"I got dibs! Officer Hopps, I am in pursuit!"
mchorn, Hey! Metermaid! Wait for the real cops!
hopps,Stop!
duke weaselton,"Bon voyage, flat foot!"
hopps,Hey! Stop right there!
duke weaselton,"Have a donut, coppah!"
hopps,I love your hair.
duke weaselton,Come to papa...
clawhauser,"Okay, you're gonna have to be patient and wait in line just like everyone else, Mrs. Otterton, okay?"
hopps,I popped the weasel!
bogo,HOPPS!
bogo,"Abandoning your post, inciting a scurry, reckless endangerment of rodents... but to be fair, you did stop a master criminal from stealing two dozen... moldy onions."
hopps,"Hate to disagree with you, sir, but those aren't onions. Those are a crocus varietal called Midnicampum Holicithias. They're a Class C Botanical, sir. I grew up in a family where plant husbandry was kind of a thing."
bogo,"Shut your tiny mouth, now."
hopps,"Sir, I got the bad guy. That's my job."
bogo,Your job is putting tickets on parked cars.
bogo,Not now.
bogo,Not now!
hopps,"Sir, I don't want to be a meter maid... I wanna be a real cop."
bogo,Do you think the Mayor asked what I wanted when he assigned you to me?
hopps,"But sir, if you--"
bogo,Life isn't some cartoon musical where you sing a little song and your insipid dreams magically come true. So let it go!
clawhauser,"I'm sorry, sir, I tried to stop her, she is super slippery. I gotta go sit down."
bogo,"Ma'am, as I've told you, we are doing everything we can..."
bogo,"Yes, I know."
bogo,"Ma'am, our detectives are very busy."
bogo,Mrs. Otterton--
bogo,Mrs. Otterton? Please wait out here.
bogo,One second.
hopps,What? Why?!
bogo,"Insubordination. Now, I'm going to open this door and you're going to tell that otter you're a former meter maid with delusions of grandeur who will not be taking the case."
bellwether,I just heard Officer Hopps is taking the case!
bogo,Assistant Mayor Bellwether...
bellwether, The Mammal Inclusion Initiative is really starting to pay off! Mayor Lionheart is just gonna be so jazzed!
bogo,"No! No, let's not tell the mayor just yet--"
bellwether,"And I sent it, and it is done, so I did do that. All right, well I'd say the case is in good hands! Us little guys really need to stick together! Right?"
hopps,Like glue!
bellwether," Good one! Just call me if you ever need anything, okay? You've always got a friend at City Hall, Judy. Alright, bye bye!"
hopps,"Thank you, ma'am."
bogo,I will give you 48 hours.
hopps,YES!
bogo,That's two days to find Emmitt Otterton.
hopps,Okay.
bogo,"But, you strike out-- you resign."
hopps,"Oh, uh... okay... deal."
bogo,Splendid. Clawhauser will give you the complete case file.
clawhauser,Here ya go! One missing otter!
hopps,That's it?!
clawhauser,"Yikes! That is the smallest case file I've ever seen! Leads: none, witnesses: none-- and you're not in the computer system yet, so resources: none.  I hope you didn't stake your career on cracking this one."
hopps,"Okay.  ""Last known sighting..."""
clawhauser,The murder weapon!
hopps,Get your pawpsicle...
clawhauser,"Yeah, `cause that... What does that mean?"
hopps,It means I... have a lead.
hopps,Hi! Hello? It's me again!
nick,"Hey, it's Officer Toot Toot."
hopps," Ha-ha-ho, no actually it's Officer Hopps, and I'm here to ask you some questions about a case."
nick,"What happened, meter maid? Did someone steal a traffic cone? It wasn't me."
hopps,"This is important, sir. I think your ten dollars worth of popsicles can wait."
nick,"I make 200 bucks a day, fluff. 365 days a year, since I was 12, and time is money, hop along."
hopps,"Please, just look at the picture."
nick,"I know everybody. And I also know that somewhere there's a toy store missing its stuffed animal, so why don't you get back to your box."
hopps,Fine. Then we'll have to do this the hard way.
nick,Did you just boot my stroller?
hopps,"Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest."
nick,For what? Howting your feewings?
hopps,Felony tax evasion.
nick,"Well, it's my word against yours."
hopps,"Actually, it's your word against yours. And if you want this pen, you're going to help me find this poor missing otter or the only place you'll be selling popsicles is the prison cafeteria.  It's called a hustle, sweetheart."
finnick,"She hustled you.  She hustled you good! You're a cop now Nick, you're gonna need one of these! Have fun working with the fuzz!"
hopps,Start talking.
nick,I don't know where he is. I only saw where he went.
hopps,"Great, let's go."
nick,It's not exactly a place for a cute little bunny.
hopps,Don't call me cute.  Get in the car.
nick,Okay. You're the boss.
hopps,"Hi, hello."
hopps,"Uh, no... I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD. I'm looking for a missing mammal, Emmitt Otterton. Right here--  --who may have frequented this establishment."
hopps,"Oh, thank you so much, I'd appreciate that more than you can imagine. It would be such a big--  You are naked!"
nick,"Yeah, in Zootopia anyone can be anything. These guys... they be naked."
nick,"Does this make you uncomfortable? Because, if so, there's no shame in calling it quits."
hopps,Yes there is.
nick,"Boy, that's the spirit."
nangi,Who?
yax,"Uh, Emmitt Otterton? Been coming to your yoga class for like 6 years?"
nangi,I have no memory of this beaver.
judy,He's an otter actually.
yax,He was here a couple Wednesdays ago. `Member?
nangi,Nope.
yax,"Yeah, he was wearing a green cable- knit sweater vest, and new pair of corduroy slacks. Oh, and a paisley tie. Sweet Windsor knot. Real tight. Remember that Nangi?"
nangi,No.
yax,"Yeah, and we both walked him out and he got into this big ol' white car with a silver trim? Needed a tune up. The third cylinder wasn't firing. `Member that, Nangi?"
nangi,Nope.
hopps,"You didn't happen to catch the license plate number, did you?"
hopps,"0, 3... Wow, this is a lot of great info, thank you."
yax,Told ya Nangi has a mind like a steel trap. I wish I had a memory like an elephant.
nick,"Well, I had a ball. You are welcome for the clue. And seeing as how any moron can run a plate, I will take that pen and bid you adieu."
hopps,The plate... I can't run a plate...  I'm not in the system yet.
nick,Give me the pen please.
hopps," What was it you said? ""Any moron can run a plate?"" Gosh... if only there were a moron around who were up to the task..."
nick,"Rabbit, I did what you asked, you can't keep me on the hook forever."
hopps,"Not forever. Why, I only have 36 hours left to solve this case. So can you run the plate or not?"
nick,"Actually, I just remembered I have a pal at the DMV..."
nick,"Flash is the fastest guy in there, you need something done, he's on it."
hopps,"I hope so, we are really fighting the clock and every minute counts.  Wait. They're all sloths?!"
nick," What? Are you saying that because he's a sloth, he can't be fast? I thought in Zootopia anyone could be anything."
flash,Nice to...  too.
nick,"Hey Flash, I'd love ya to meet my friend-- uh, darlin' I've forgotten your name."
hopps, How are ya?
flash,I am... doing... just...
hopps,Fine?
flash,...as well... as... I can... be. What...
nick, Hang in there.
flash,...can I... do...
hopps,"Well, I was hoping you could run a plate--"
flash,For you...
hopps,"Well, I was hoping you could--"
flash,...today.
hopps,"Well, I was hoping you could run a plate for us. We are in a really big hurry."
flash,Sure.    What's the... plate...
hopps,"2, 9, T--"
flash,...Number?
flash,T.
flash,H.
flash,D.
hopps,3!
nick,"Hey Flash, wanna hear a joke?"
hopps,No!
flash,Sure.
nick,What do you call a three humped camel?
flash,I don't... know...  What... do... you call... a...
hopps,Three humped camel.
flash,Three humped... camel?
nick,Pregnant.
flash,Ha... ha... ha... ha...
hopps,"Ha, ha, yes very funny, very funny, can we please just focus on the task--"
flash,Hey... Priscilla...
hopps,Oh no!
priscilla,Yes... Flash?
flash,What... do...
hopps,No!
flash,You call... a...
hopps,"A three humped camel? Pregnant! Okay, great, we got it, please just- -"
flash,Three... humped...
hopps,Aggggggghhhhhhh--
flash,Here...
hopps,"Yeah, yeah, yeah... thank you!"
flash,You... go.
hopps," 29THD03-- it's registered to... Tundratown Limo Service? A limo took Otterton, and the limo's in Tundratown-- it's in Tundratown!"
nick,"Way to hustle, bud. I love ya. I owe ya."
hopps,"Hurry, we gotta beat the rush hour and--"
hopps,IT'S NIGHT?!
hopps,Closed. Great.
nick,Mm. And I will betcha you don't have a warrant to get in. Hm? Darn it. It's a bummer.
hopps,You wasted the day on purpose.
nick,"Madam, I have a fake badge. I would never impede your pretend investigation."
hopps,"It's not a pretend investigation! Look, see--  See him? This otter is missing."
nick,Well then they should have gotten a real cop to find him.
hopps,"What is your problem? Does seeing me fail somehow make you feel better about your own sad, miserable life?"
nick,"It does. One hundred percent.  Now... since you're sans warrant, I guess we're done?"
hopps,Fine. We are done. Here's your pen.
nick,Hey! 
hopps,"The thing is, you don't need a warrant if you have probable cause, and I'm pretty sure I saw a shifty low-life climbing the fence, so you're helping plenty. Come on."
hopps,Polar bear fur.
nick, OH MY GOD!
hopps,What? What?!
nick,The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole! But on CD? Who still uses CDs?
hopps,Those are... claw marks. You ever seen anything like this?
nick,No.
hopps,"Oh, wait. Look."
nick,"Well, now wait a minute...  I know whose car this is. We gotta go!"
hopps,Why? Whose car is it?
nick,"The most feared crime boss in Tundratown. They call him Mr. Big and he does not like me, so we gotta go!"
hopps,"I'm not leaving, this is a crime scene."
nick,"Well, it's gonna be an even bigger crime scene if Mr. Big finds me here, so we're leaving right now!  Nick ushers Hopps to the door, but opens it to find two big POLAR BEARS.  NICK  That's a no.  ...and yank them off screen."
hopps,What did you do that made Mr. Big so mad at you?
nick," I uh, I may have sold him a very expensive wool rug... that was made from the fur of a... skunk's butt."
hopps," Oh, sweet cheese and crackers."
hopps, Is that Mr. Big?
nick, No.
hopps,What about him? Is that him?
nick, No.
hopps,That's gotta be him.
nick,Stop talking stop talking stop talking--
nick,"Well actually we were brought here against our will, so...  Point is, I did not know it was your car, and I certainly did not know about your daughter's wedding."
hopps,"Sir, I am a c--"
nick,"Mime! She is a mime. This mime, cannot speak. You can't speak if you're a mime."
hopps,"No. I am a cop. And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case, and my evidence puts him in your car, so intimidate me all you want, I'm going to find out what you did to that otter if it's the last thing I do."
nick,Whoa-- I didn't see nothing-- I'm not saying nothing--
nick,Please! No no no! If you're mad at me about the rug I've got more rugs!
hopps,Hi.  I love your dress.
hopps,Because he was attacked.
hopps,Otterton?
hopps,He's a sweet little otter.
hopps,"Mr. Manchas? Judy Hopps, ZPD. We just want to know what happened to Emmitt Otterton."
nick,Whoa. A teensy otter... did that?
hopps,What... happened?
manchas," There was no warning, he just kept yelling about the ""night howlers."" Over and over, ""the night howlers..."""
nick,"Oh. So you know about the night howlers too? Good, good, good. Because the night howlers are exactly what we are here to talk about.  Right?"
hopps,"Yep. So, uh, you just open the door and tell us what you know and we will tell you what we know. Okay?"
manchas, Okay.
hopps,Clever fox.
nick,Buddy?
hopps,Are you... okay?
nick,What is wrong with him?!
hopps,I don't know!!  Nick and Hopps run across the bridge. Manchas closes in.  HOPPS  Officer Hopps to dispatch!
clawhauser,"Are you familiar with Gazelle? Greatest singer of our lifetime-- angel with horns-- okay, hold on, keep watching. Who's that beside her? Who is it?"
clawhauser, Hold on a second--
hopps,"Clawhauser, listen to me! We have a 10-91! Jaguar gone savage! Vine and Tu-junja!"
nick,It's Tujunga!
hopps,There! Head to the skytrams!
nick,Get in! Carrots? Carrots!
hopps,Go!
nick,"No, no, no!"
hopps,I'm gonna let go!
nick,"No, you what? No, I said-- listen-- noooo!"
hopps,"One, two--"
nick,Carrots. You saved my life.
hopps,Well. That's what we do at the ZP...  Deeeeeeeeeeeee.....
bogo,"Well, this should be good."
hopps,"I thought this was just a missing mammal case, but it's way bigger. "
bogo," Savage? This isn't the Stone Age, Hopps. Animals don't go savage."
hopps,"I thought so too, `til I saw this:"
bogo," The ""savage"" jaguar."
hopps,"Sir, I know what I saw-- he almost killed us."
bogo,Or maybe any aggressive predator looks savage to you rabbits.  Let's go.
hopps,"Wait-- Sir, I'm not the only one who saw him!  Nick!"
bogo, You think I'm going to believe a fox?
hopps,Well he was a key witness and I enlisted--
hopps,"But, Sir, we..."
bogo,Badge.
bogo,"What did you say, fox?"
nick,"Sorry, what I said was, ""no."" She will not be giving you that badge. Look, you gave her a clown vest and a three-wheel joke-mobile and two days to solve a case you guys haven't cracked in two weeks? Yeah, no wonder she needed to get help from a fox, none of you guys were gonna help her, were you?"
hopps,Thank you.
nick,Never let `em see that they get to you.
hopps,"So, things do get to you..."
nick,"No... I mean, not anymore. But I was small and emotionally unbalanced like you once."
hopps,Har-har.
nick," No, it's true. I think was 8, or maybe 9, and all I wanted to do was join the Junior Ranger Scouts."
young nick,Yeah! Pretty much born ready.
young nick,"I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave, loyal, helpful, and trustworthy."
young nick,What?
nick,"I learned two things that day. One, I was never gonna let anyone see that they got to me."
hopps,...And two?
nick,"If the world's only gonna see a fox as shifty and untrustworthy, there's no point in trying to be anything else."
hopps,"Nick, you are so much more than that..."
nick,"Boy, look at that traffic down there.  How about we go out to Chuck in Traffic Central-- Chuck, how are things looking on the Jam Cams?"
hopps,"Nick, I'm glad you told me..."
nick, The Jam Cams...!
hopps,"Seriously, it's okay..."
nick,No-n-shh-shush! There are traffic cameras everywhere. All over the canopy. Whatever happened to that jaguar--
hopps,The traffic cams would have caught it!
nick,Bingo!
hopps,"Pretty sneaky, Slick."
nick,"However. If you didn't have access to the system before, I doubt Chief Buffalo Butt is gonna let you into it now."
hopps, No... But I have a friend at City Hall who might.
bellwether,Sir? If we could just review these very important--  Sir?
lionheart,"Okay. I heard you, Bellwether. Just take care of it!  Please. And clear my afternoon, I'm going out."
bellwether,"No, no! But, sir, you do have a meeting with Herds and Grazing... sir, if I could just--"
hopps,Assistant Mayor Bellwether? We need your help.
hopps,We just need to get into the traffic cam database.
nick, So fluffy!
hopps,Hey!
nick,Sheep never let me this close.
hopps,You can't just touch a sheep's wool...
bellwether,Where to?
hopps,"Rainforest District, Vine and Tujunga."
bellwether,"There! Traffic cams for the whole city. This is so exciting, actually. Well, you know, I never get to do anything this important."
hopps,But you're the Assistant Mayor of Zootopia.
bellwether,"Oh, I'm more of a glorified secretary. I think Mayor Lionheart just wanted the sheep vote...  But he did give me that nice mug."
bellwether,"That's a fun little name he likes to use. I called him Lionfart once. He did not care for that, let me tell you. It was not a good day for me.  Yes, sir?"
bellwether,"Oh, dear. I better go --  Let me know what you find. It was really nice for me to be--"
nick,You think when she goes to sleep she counts herself?
hopps,"Shush. Okay, traffic cams...  Tujunga, Tujunga... we're in."
nick,Timberwolves. Look at these dumdums.
hopps, Howlers! Night howlers! That's what Manchas was afraid of... wolves! The wolves are the night howlers. If they took Manchas...
nick,...I bet they took Otterton too.
hopps,All we gotta do is find out where they went.
nick,"You know, if I wanted to avoid surveillance because I was doing something illegal-- which I never have-- I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B... which would put them out..."
hopps,"Well, look at you, Junior Detective. You know, I think you'd actually make a pretty good cop."
nick,How dare you.
hopps,They're heading out of town... Where does that road go?
wolf guard,"Gary, quit it, you're gonna start a howl."
wolf guard,Oooooooooo!
hopps,Come on!
nick,You are a clever bunny.
hopps,It looks like this was a hospital.
nick," You know, after you, you're the cop."
nick,Okay. All clear.
hopps,All this equipment is brand new...
hopps,Claw marks...
nick,"Yeah. Huge, huge, claw marks. I mean, what kind of--"
hopps,Mr. Manchas.
nick,Or not. Guess he's in no rush to get home to the Missus.
hopps,"...11, 12, 13, 14. Not including Manchas it's 14...  Chief Bogo handed out 14 Missing Mammal files... They're all here. All the missing mammals are right here."
badger doctor,"Mayor Lionheart, please, we're doing everything we can."
lionheart,"Really? Cuz I got a dozen and a half animals here who've gone off the rails crazy-- and you can't tell me why. Now, I'd call that awfully far from doing everything."
badger doctor,"Sir, it may be time to consider their biology."
lionheart,What? What do you mean biology?
badger doctor,The only animals going savage are predators. We cannot keep it a secret. We need to come forward.
lionheart,"Hmm... Great idea. Tell the public. And how do you think they're gonna feel about their mayor, who is a lion?! I'll be ruined!"
badger doctor,"Well, what does Chief Bogo say?"
lionheart,Chief Bogo doesn't know. And we are going to keep it that way.
badger doctor,"Sir, you need to go, now!  Security! Sweep the area!"
nick,Great! We're dead. We're dead. That's it. I'm dead. You're dead. Everybody's dead.
hopps,Can you swim?
nick,"What? Can I swim? Yes, I can swim. Why?"
hopps,We gotta tell Bogo!
clawhauser,Chief Bogo!
bogo, Not now!
clawhauser,"Wait, is that Gazelle?"
bogo, No!
clawhauser,"You have the app too?!  Oh, jeeeeez!"
bogo,"Clawhauser, can't you see I'm working on the missing mammal cases?!"
clawhauser,"Oh, yes of course! About that, sir... Officer Hopps just called... She found all of `em."
hopps,"Mayor Lionheart, you have the right to remain silent. Anything--"
lionheart,You don't understand. I was trying to protect the city.
hopps,You were just trying to protect your job.
lionheart,"No. Listen, we still don't know why this is happening. It could destroy Zootopia."
hopps,You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law...
bogo,"Ladies and Gentlemammals... 14 mammals went missing and all 14 have been found by our newest recruit, who will speak to you in a moment. But first, let me remind you--"
hopps,Rrrgh. I am so nervous...
nick,"Okay, press conference 101: You wanna look smart? "
hopps,You should be there with me. We did this together.
nick,"Well, am I a cop? No. No, I am not."
hopps,"Funny you should say that, because I've been thinking... it would be nice to have a partner."
bellwether,"Officer Hopps, it's time."
bogo,"So now, I'll turn things over to the officer who cracked the case. Officer Judy Hopps."
press,Officer Hopps! / Over here! / Here!
hopps, Yes?
reporter,What can you tell us about the animals that went savage?
hopps,"Well, the animals in question...  Are they all different species? Yes. Yes they are."
reporter 2,"Okay, so what is the connection?"
hopps,"Well, all we know is that they are all members of the predator family."
another reporter,"So, predators are the only ones going savage?"
hopps,"That is accu-- Yes, that is accurate. Yes..."
reporter 3,Wow. Why is that happening?
hopps,We still don't know--
hopps,"A biological component. You know, something in their DNA..."
reporter 4," In their DNA? Can you elaborate on that, please?"
hopps,"Yes. What I mean is, thousands of years ago... um... predators survived through their aggressive hunting instincts. For whatever reason, they seem to be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways."
hopps,It is possible. So we must be vigilant. And we at the ZPD are prepared and are here to protect you...
press,Will more mammals go savage? / What is being done to protect us? / Have you considered a mandatory quarantine on predators?
bellwether,"Okay, thank you Officer Hopps, uh, that's all the time that we have. No more questions..."
hopps,Was I okay?
bellwether,"Oh, you did fine."
hopps, That went so fast! I didn't get a chance to mention you or say anything about how we--
nick," Oh, I think you said plenty."
hopps,What do you mean?
nick," Clearly, there's a biological component? These predators may be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways. Are you serious?"
hopps,"I just stated the facts of the case. I mean, it's not like a bunny could go savage..."
nick,Right. But a fox could? Huh?
hopps,"Nick, stop it. You're not like them."
nick,"Oh, there's a them now?"
hopps,You know what I mean. You're not that kind of predator.
nick,The kind that needs to be muzzled? The kind that makes you think you need to carry around Fox Repellent?
hopps,No. Nick. Nick!
reporter 5,Officer Hopps! Were you just threatened by that predator?
hopps,No. He's my friend.
reporter 6,We can't even trust our own friends?
hopps,That is not what I said! Please!
reporters,Are we safe? / Have any other foxes gone savage?
pig,"Go back to the forest, predator!"
leopard,I'm from the savannah!
gazelle,"Zootopia is a unique place. It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city where we celebrate our differences.  This is not the Zootopia I know."
gazelle,We cannot let fear divide us. Please-- give me back the Zootopia I love...
bogo,Come on Hopps. The new Mayor wants to see us.
hopps,The Mayor? Why?
bogo,It would seem you've arrived.
hopps,Clawhauser? What're you doing?
clawhauser,"Um, they thought it would be better if a predator such as myself wasn't the first face you that you see when you walk into the ZPD."
hopps,What?
clawhauser,They're gonna move me to Records. It's downstairs. By the boiler.
bogo,Hopps!
hopps,Um... I don't understand.
bellwether,"Our city is 90% prey, Judy. And right now they're just really scared. You're a hero to them. They trust you. And so that's why Chief Bogo and I want you to be the public face of the ZPD."
hopps," I'm not... I'm not a hero. I came here to make the world a better place, but I think I broke it."
bogo,"Don't give yourself so much credit, Hopps. The world has always been broken. That's why we need good cops-- like you."
hopps,"With all due respect, sir, a good cop is supposed to serve and protect-- help the city. Not tear it apart.  I don't deserve this badge."
bogo,Hopps.
bellwether,"Judy, you've worked so hard to get here. It's what you've wanted since you were a kid. You can't quit..."
hopps,Thank you for the opportunity.
hopps,A dozen carrots.
rabbit mom,Thanks!
hopps,Have a nice day.
rabbit mom, Come on.
stu hopps,"Hey there, Jude-- Jude the dude, remember that one? How we doin?"
bonnie hopps,You are not fine. Your ears are droopy.
hopps,Why did I think I could make a difference?
stu hopps,"Because you're a trier, that's why."
bonnie hopps,You've always been a trier.
hopps,"Oh, I tried. And it made life so much worse for so many innocent predators."
stu hopps,"Oh, not all of them, though. Speak of the devil. Right on time."
hopps,Is that... Gideon Grey?
stu hopps,Yep. It sure is. We work with him now.
bonnie hopps,He's our partner. And we never would have considered it had you not opened our minds.
stu hopps,"That's right. I mean, Gid's turned into one of the top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows."
hopps,"That's really cool, you guys."
hopps,"Well, I know a thing or two about being a jerk..."
stu hopps,Hey kids! Don't you run through that midnicampum holicithias!
rabbit kid," Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
hopps,"I'm sorry, what did you say?"
stu hopps,"Oh, Gid's talking about those flowers, Judy. I use `em to keep bugs off the produce. But I don't like the little ones going near `em on account of what happened to your Uncle Terry."
bonnie hopps,"Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we were kids and went completely nuts."
stu hopps,He bit the dickens out of your mother.
hopps, A bunny can go savage...
bonnie hopps,"Savage? Well, that's a strong word. But it did hurt like the devil."
stu hopps,Well sure it did. There's a sizable divot in your arm. I'd call that savage.
hopps, Night howlers aren't wolves. They're flowers. The flowers are making the predators go savage. That's it! That's what I've been missing!
stu hopps,"You catch any of that, Bon?"
bonnie hopps,Not one bit.
gideon grey,"Well, that makes me feel a little better. I thought she was talking in tongues or something."
finnick,Who is it?
hopps,I need to find Nick. Please.
hopps,Nick? Nick!
nick,Wow. Isn't that interesting.
hopps,"Wait! Wait, please-- I know you'll never forgive me. And I don't blame you. I wouldn't forgive me either. I was ignorant and irresponsible and small-minded... But predators shouldn't suffer because of my mistakes. I have to fix this, but I can't do it without you."
nick,"Don't worry, Carrots, I'll let you erase it... in 48 hours."
hopps,I'm sorry.
nick,I thought you guys only grew carrots.  What's the plan?
hopps,We are gonna follow the night howlers.
nick,Okay. How?
hopps, Know this guy?
nick,"Uh-huh. I told you, I know everybody."
duke weaselton,"Well, hello, step right up! Anything you need... I got it. All your favorite movies! I got movies that haven't even been released yet!"
nick," Well, well, look who it is. The duke of bootleg."
duke weaselton,"What's it to you, Wilde? Shouldn't you be melting down a popsicle or something?  Hey, if it isn't Flopsy the Copsy."
hopps,"We both know those weren't moldy onions I caught you stealing. What were you gonna do with those night howlers, Wessleton?"
duke weaselton,"It's Weaselton. Duke Weaselton. And I ain't talking, rabbit. And ain't nothing you can do to make me."
duke weaselton,Aaagh! Agh!  Ya dirty rat! Why ya helping her?! She's a cop!
hopps,Aw.
duke weaselton,"All right, all right, please! I'll talk! I'll talk. I stole them night howlers so I could sell `em. They offered me what I couldn't refuse... Money."
hopps,And to whom did you sell them?
hopps,Come on!  As they sneak up to it... Hopps pulls open the window and looks inside the car. They both jump into...
hopps,The weasel wasn't lying.
nick,"Yeah, looks like old Doug's cornered the market on night howlers..."
doug, You got Doug here. What's the mark? Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it.
doug, Out.
nick,"Hey. Hey! Where are you going? Get back here! What are you doing?! He's gonna see you! What are you looking at? Hey! Whatever you're thinking, stop thinking it. Carrots! Carrots!"
doug,It better have the extra foam this time--
nick,What are you doing?! You just trapped us in here!
hopps,We need to get this evidence to the ZPD.
nick,Okay. Great. Here it is. Got it.
hopps,No. All of it!
nick,"Wait, what?"
doug, Oh! It just got worse!
nick,Mission accomplished. Would it be premature for me to do a little victory toot-toot?
hopps,All right. One toot-toot.
nick,"Well, I can cross that off the bucket list."
hopps, Don't stop! Keep going!
jesse, No! No! Please stop!
hopps,Do not stop this car!
nick, There's another train coming!
hopps,Trust me! SPEED! UP!
woolter,Stop the train! Hey!
hopps,Hey. Need some help?
nick,"Oh no! Oh no, no, no! Too fast! Hold on!"
hopps,Okay... Maybe some of the evidence survived.
nick," Yeah. Oh, except for this."
hopps,"Oh, Nick! Yes!"
nick,Ow.
hopps,Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD. Cut through the Natural History Museum!
hopps,Oh! There it is!
hopps,Mayor Bellwether!  We found out what's happening. Someone's darting predators with a serum-- that's what's making them go savage.
bellwether," I am so proud of you, Judy. You did just a super job."
hopps,"Thank you, ma'am.  How did you know where to find us?"
bellwether,I'll go ahead and I'll take that case now.
hopps,You know what... I think Nick and I will just take this to the ZPD...
bellwether,Get them!
hopps,Ach!
nick,Ah Carrots!
hopps,Pass.
hopps,Take the case. Get it to Bogo.
nick,I'm not gonna leave you behind. That's not happening.
hopps,I can't walk.
nick,"Just, we'll think of something."
bellwether,"We're on the same team, Judy!"
bellwether,"Underestimated. Under-appreciated. Aren't you sick of it? Predators. They may be strong and loud, but prey out-number predators 10 to one."
hopps,What are you going to do? Kill me?
bellwether,No! Of course not... he is.
hopps,No! Nick?!
bellwether,"Yes, police! There's a savage fox in the natural history museum. Officer Hopps is down! Please hurry!"
hopps,"No. Nick, don't do this. Fight it."
bellwether,"Oh, but he can't help it, can he? Since preds are just biologically predisposed to be savages."
hopps,"So that's it, prey fears predator, and you stay in power?"
bellwether,"Yeah, pretty much."
hopps,It won't work.
bellwether,Fear always works. And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way.
hopps," Oh, Nick! No!"
bellwether,"Bye-Bye, Bunny."
hopps,"Blood, blood, blood! And death."
nick,"All right, you're milking it. Besides, I think we got it, I think we got it. We got it up there, thank you yakkety-yak-- you laid it all out beautifully."
bellwether,What?
nick,"Yea, oh, are you looking for the serum?  Well, it's right here."
hopps,What you've got in the weapon there- - those are blueberries. From my family's farm.
nick,They are delicious.  You should try some.
bellwether,"I framed Lionheart, I can frame you too! It's my word against yours!"
hopps,"Oooo, actually--"
hopps,"--It's your word against yours. It's called a hustle, sweetheart. Boom."
prey anchor,"Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart, denies any knowledge of her plot, claiming he was just trying to protect the city."
lionheart,"Did I falsely imprison those animals? Well, yes. Yes I did. It was a classic ""doing the wrong thing for the right reason"" kind of a deal."
pred anchor,"In related news, doctors say the night howler antidote is proving effective in rehabilitating the afflicted predators..."
hopps,"So, no matter what type of animal you are, from the biggest elephant to our first fox..."
bogo,"...Enough! Shut it! We have some new recruits with us this morning, including our first fox. Who cares."
nick,"Ha! You should have your own line of inspirational greeting cards, sir."
bogo,"Shut your mouth, Wilde. Assignments! Officers Grizzoli, Fangmeyer, Delgato: Tundratown Swat. Snarlov, Higgins, Wolfard: Undercover. Hopps, Wilde...  Just kidding! We have reports of a street racer tearing up Savannah Central. Find him, shut him down."
nick,So are all rabbits bad drivers or is it just you?
hopps,Oops. Sorry.
nick, Sly bunny.
hopps,Dumb fox.
nick,You know you love me.
hopps,"Do I know that? Yes. Yes, I do."
hopps,"Sir, you were going 115 miles per hour. I hope you have a good explanation."
nick,Flash? Flash? Hundred yard dash?!
flash, Nick.
