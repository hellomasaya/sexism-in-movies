Speaker,Dialogue
hassan, Good morning Abdullah... I brought you this...
hassan, It's almost new.
abdullah,How much do you want for everything?
hassan,One thousand dirhams.
abdullah,One thousand dirhams? I'll give you one thousand and a goat.
hassan,"With this rifle, your sons will be able to kill plenty of jackals."
abdullah,Let Yussef shoot.
ahmed,I want to shoot first.
hassan,"Look, load it like this."
abdullah,Your turn.
yasira,Your lunch.
abdullah,You better kill at least three jackals.
hassan,"And make sure no one sees you with the rifle, hide it if you see someone approach you."
ahmed,"Yussef, Yussef..."
ahmed,What are you doing?
yussef,What the hell do you care?
ahmed,"Come on, let's go."
ahmed,Five to two.
yussef,There's a jackal over there.
yussef,Zora doesn't mind.
ahmed,"She doesn't, but I do."
yussef,This is between her and me.
ahmed,You're both pigs. Next time I'm going to tell my dad.
yussef,Stay out of this.
ahmed,"If you want me to stay out of it, don't do it."
yussef,What are you doing?
ahmed,"Hassan said that it could hit things three kilometers away, but it can't even reach that rock over there."
yussef,That's because you don't know how to shoot. Give me the rifle.
ahmed,"See, it can't reach it."
yussef,Give me another bullet.
ahmed,"Yeah, but that's not three kilometers."
yussef,You're not aiming right.
ahmed,I'll shoot.
yussef,Let me shoot.
ahmed,I told you.    Hassan's a liar.
amelia, I won...
mike,"No, I won."
amelia," Yes... yes sir... yes sir, Mrs. Rachel told me...I'm very sorry. How is Mrs. Susan?... No sir, don't worry..."
mike,"Hi dad... dad, guess what? Today, at school, they brought some baby chickens...I held one in my hand. He was really little and he was all warm...  Dad, are you ok?...And Mariana wanted to take one home, but the teacher didn't let her..."
amelia, Did you brush your teeth?
mike,Will you tell us a story?
amelia,One and then you're going to sleep.
mike,Pajaritos?     Little birds?
amelia,"Of course, that's what hawks eat. So, one day the hawk flew so, so high that it crashed into an airplane. It fainted and started to fall. And when it was about to hit the ground, all the birds flew toward him and saved him."
debbie,They saved him?
amelia,"Yes, and when the hawk was healthy again he went to talk to the birds and said: I want to thank you for saving me, but I can't change and I'm going to keep hunting you. The little birds answered: we don't care that you hunt us, because that's who you are. But we will always save you, because that's who we are."
debbie,No.
amelia,Quedamos en que se iban a dormir con la luz apagada.
debbie,But I'm scared.
amelia,No pasa nada.
debbie,I'm scared that what happened to Pat is gonna happen to me.
amelia,A ti no te va a pasar eso...
debbie,Pat died while she was sleeping.
amelia,That only happens to some babies when they're really little.
mike,Then why did daddy get so angry at mommy?
amelia,"He wasn't angry, he was just very sad."
debbie,He left.
amelia,"Go to sleep. I'll sit here with you, but you can't talk anymore."
amelia,Yes...
amelia,Your sister-in-law promised me to find someone.
amelia,It's because... I told Mrs. Jones three months ago that today is my son's wedding.
amelia,"Sir, everything is ready. Can't anyone come take care of the kids? It's just one day."
amelia, Do you want another quesadilla?
debbie,Mhh.
mike,How many little birds did the hawk eat?
amelia," None, because he started to like quesadillas."
debbie,Is the bus here?
amelia," Yes, but today you're not going to school."
debbie,Why?
amelia,We have things to do.
amelia, I just want you to take of them for today.
amelia,And she won't go out?
amelia,"Ok, thanks.    I'll call you tomorrow."
lucia, I can't Amelia.
amelia,"Please, it's my son's wedding. I helped you out with that thing with your boyfriend."
lucia,I really can't.
amelia,"Just for the day, Lucia.   I'll be back for them tonight."
lucia,And what do I tell Mrs. Black?
amelia,Tell her they're your nephews.
lucia,"Yeah right, they look just like me...with this gringa look I have."
mike,Are we going to see your house?
amelia,"Yes, you're going to see my house."
mike,Is it far?
amelia, Not very.
santiago, Good morning Aunt Amelia.
amelia,Good morning.
santiago,Are they coming?
amelia,I couldn't find anyone to leave them with. Their parents aren't coming back today.
santiago,"Why bring them, they're just going to make trouble."
amelia,They're good kids.
santiago,I know a woman who can take care of them.
amelia,"Santiago, I have to take them. I can't leave them with just anybody."
santiago,What if you lose your job?
amelia,"Come on, don't tempt the fates."
anwar, The Berbers built these kasbahs. They made them like forts and here they would reside after finishing their caravans.
richard,"This place is beautiful, don't you think?"
susan," Yeah, yeah it's very pretty..."
anwar,"Now, I'd like to show you the materials that were used to build the walls..."
waiter, You want to order?
richard,"I'll have a chicken cous-cous and a Coke, please."
susan,What do you have that doesn't have fat in it?
waiter,Everything is delicious.
susan,I'll have the fried eggplant and a diet Coke.
waiter,We don't have diet Coke.
susan,Then a regular Coke.
richard,"Look, look: a hawk."
susan,"Richard, why did we come here?"
richard,What d'you mean why? I thought you would like it.
susan,Really: why are we here?
richard,"To forget everything, to be alone."
susan,Alone?
richard,The Coke is warm.
susan,"Yeah, but you don't know what kind of water is in there."
richard,Why can't you ever relax.    You're always stressed.
susan,You're the one stressing me out. You're why I can't relax.
richard,You could if you tried.
susan,Tried? Don't you think I tried?
richard,"You're never going to forgive me, are you?"
susan,Do you even know what I'm talking about?
richard,"Susan, please; we didn't come all this way just to argue."
susan,"Oh, we didn't? Then when are we supposed to ""argue""? Or are you planning on running away again?"
boys,Stilo...stilo...
susan,I don't have any money... I don't have any...

chieko,"You're not just deaf, you're blind."
referee,You're out.
chieko,You're an asshole.
teammate 1,You shouldn't have lost your temper. We lost the game.
chieko,"It wasn't my fault, it was the ref."
teammate 2,"If you hadn't been thrown out, we would've won the game."
teammate 1,Why are you in a bad mood?
teammate 2,She's always in a bad mood because nobody's fucked her yet.
chieko,I'm gonna fuck your dad to get rid of my mood.
yasujiro,What do you want to eat?
chieko,I said I'd meet my friends from the team at Eve's.
yasujiro,Weren't we going to have lunch together?
chieko,"Dad, I told you I was going to eat with them, but you never pay attention to me."
yasujiro,Why do you want to fight?
yasujiro, Don't forget you have the dentist at four.
hostess,Do you have a table?
chieko,Why all the way in the corner?
mitsu,Because of the view.
young man,Hello.
chieko,Tell him I couldn't read his lips.
mitsu, What's the matter?

yasira,What are you doing here?
yussef,Something we ate gave us a stomach ache.
yasira,And is that why you're insulting your sister?
yussef,We were feeling really ill.
yasira,The goats are going to feel even worse if they don't eat. Take them out again.
ahmed,Our stomach really hurts.
yasira,Then start jerking the meat.
ahmed,D'you think something happened?
yussef,I don't know.
ahmed,People were screaming.
yussef,It was both our faults. We both shot.  Swear to me you'll never say anything.
ahmed,I swear.   Nobody.
abdullah,"Thank you, I'll see you tomorrow."
yussef,"Mother, mother, father says he wants to have dinner now."
abdullah,Did you kill any jackals?
yussef,"We shot at them, but didn't hit them."
abdullah,You have to kill them. If not they're going to eat all the goats.
yasira,Why are you home so late?
abdullah,"They closed the road, and we had to take the long way around.  Apparently some terrorists killed an American tourist."
yasira,An American?
abdullah,"Yes, the terrorists attacked a tour bus on the road."
yasira,But there aren't any terrorists here.
abdullah,You never know.
yussef,And how do you know the American died?

anwar,He says she will be fine.
richard,"Stop lying to me god damn it, and tell me what the fuck he said!"
doctor,Hospital... need hospital...

susan,What do you mean stitches?
richard,You're not going to give her any anesthetic?
anwar," No, he doesn't use anesthetic."
richard,What kind of doctor is he?
anwar,"He's a veterinarian, but he is good."
richard,He can't take care of her.
susan,"Richard, he might infect the wound..."
doctor, Tell him that if I don't stitch up her wound she may bleed to death.
anwar,"If he doesn't sew up the wound, she may bleed to death."
doctor, And tell him her clavicle is broken. We have to fasten a splint to it.
anwar,He says she has a broken bone and he has to put a splint on it.
doctor, We're going to have to hold her down.

richard,"I'm going to tell Mike on you, so you never scold him again."
susan,I need to pee again.
richard, Do you have a pot I can borrow?
susan,I can't.
richard,"Forgive me my love. When Pat died I didn't know what to do, the pain drove me crazy... I was scared, that's why I left... forgive me."

amelia, Yes sir.
police officer,Do you understand English?
amelia, Yes sir.
police officer," Ma'am, it was a miracle that we found those kids. I don't know how you could leave them alone in the desert."
amelia,I had to look for help.
police officer,Your reckless behavior endangered their lives.
amelia,How are they?
police officer,"That's none of your business, ma'am."
amelia,I just took the kids to my son's wedding.
police officer,"No ma'am, you did not just do that. You took them to another country without their parents' permission and you put them in danger."
amelia,"Sir, I raised these kids since they were born. I take care of them day and night. I feed them breakfast, lunch and dinner. I play with them. Mike and Debbie are like my own children."
police officer," But they are not your kids, ma'am."
amelia,"What about my nephew, Santiago?"
police officer,I don't have any information on him.
amelia,"I've been living here for fifteen years. My things are here, I rent a house, I made my life here."
police officer,You should've thought of that beforehand.
amelia,I want to talk to a lawyer.
police officer,"If you attempt to take this to court, I assure you you will end up in jail. If you want my advice, accept the deportation and never come back."

richard,The last thing I'm worried about right now is the fucking press.
moroccan doctor, We're going to have to operate immediately.
richard,Is she going to be ok?
moroccan doctor,"It's probable. We're going to try to save her arm.   She's been bleeding internally, and there's been some clotting so there's a high risk of gangrene."
richard, But she's going to be ok?
moroccan doctor,"Yes, she's going to be ok."
richard,Amelia?
richard,How is everything?
richard,"They're going to operate now... Amelia... take good care of the kids, and don't tell them anything..."

yasujiro,"I don't remember the license, but I did have a rifle like the one you described."
kenji,"Is it true that you gave it to a Mr. Hassan Ibrahim, who lives in southern Morocco?"
yasujiro,Hassan Ibrahim?
kenji,He says he was your guide in a hunt.
yasujiro,Hassan? Of course. He was a very good guide and I gave him the rifle. Hassan is a very kind man. Did anything happen?
kenji,"There was an attempted murder with that rifle, and the Moroccan police want to confirm it's not off the black market."
yasujiro,"No, I gave it to him.  Is Hassan ok?"
kenji,I don't know.
yasujiro,Am I legally involved?
kenji,Not for the moment. You may have to go testify for your friend.
yasujiro,Can I leave now?
kenji,Good night.
yasujiro,What balcony?
kenji,About how your wife killed herself by jumping off the balcony.
yasujiro,My wife never jumped off a balcony. She shot herself in the head. My daughter was the first to find her.
kenji,"I'm very sorry sir, we won't bother you anymore. Good night."
kenji,Another whisky.
reporter,"Susan Jones, the American woman wounded in an attack in Morocco ten days ago, left the hospital today, heading to the United States..."
