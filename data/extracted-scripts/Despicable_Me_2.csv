Speaker,Dialogue
silas,Three weeks and we're still no closer to cracking this?
agnes,This is the best party EVER!!!
edith,Haha!   Yeah!
agnes,Oh no!   A dragon is approaching!
margo,"Fear not, for here come the gallant knights to save us!"
gru,"No, no, no! What do you mean she's not coming?! I have a backyard full of these little girls who are counting on a visit from a fairy princess!"
agnes,Ooh ooh!   When's the Fairy Princess coming?
gru,Any minute now!
agnes,Yayyy!
gru,Stall them.
margo,"Whoa! Whoa! Okay, okay, alright. That's enough of the magic show!"
minions,Awwww.
margo,"Wait, did you hear that? It sounded like the twinkling sounds of magical fairy dust."
agnes, It's the fairy princess!   She's coming!
margo,Look!
gru,Aaaaaahh!
little girl,How come you're tho fat?
gru,Because my house is made of candy and sometimes I eat instead of facing my problems.
little girl,How come you have-
gru,Okay!   Time for cake!
agnes,"Thank you, Gru-zinkerbell. You're the best fairy princess ever!"
gru," You are welcome, little girl."
agnes," I know it's really you, Gru. I'm just pretending for the other kids."
jillian,"Hey there, Gru, Mr. Life of the Party!"
gru," Hello, Jillian."
jillian,"Sooooo, I'm gonna go out on a limb here, but my friend Natalie is recently single, and..."
gru," No, no, no, get off of the limb right now. No limb."
jillian,"Oh, come on...she's a riot. She sings karaoke, she has a lot of free time, looks aren't that important to her..."
gru,"No, Jill's, that is not happening. Seriously. I'm fine."
jillian," Okay, fine. Forget Natalie.        How about my cousin Linda?"
gru,No.
jillian,"Oh, oh! I know someone whose husband just died!"
gru,I'm sorry.     I did not see you there.
gru,Kyle... Kyle!
gru,Wha?   I didn't... What... Yes?
lucy," Sorry, you're gonna have to come with me."
gru,"Oh, sorry, I--Freeze Ray!"
lucy,"You know you really should announce your weapons after you fire them, Mr. Gru. For example--"
lucy,Man.    Ugh.     Large...person.
tom,Koom ey lah!
stuart,Koom ey lah! Koom ey lah!
tom,Ooooh!
stuart,Quack quack!
confused fisherman,What the--     Oh!
minions,Whoa...
gru," Ugh...ooh...what...where...ah...oh, foot's asleep...ah...pins and needles..."
gru,Ehhh...
silas,I apologize for our methods in getting you here.
lucy,"I don't. I'd do it again in a heartbeat. I am not gonna lie--I enjoyed that. Every second of it. Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually."
silas,"That's enough, Agent Wilde."
lucy,"Sorry, sir."
gru,"Okay, this is bogus!"
silas,We are the Anti-Villain League.
gru,"First of all, you've got no proof that I did that. Second, after I did do that, I put it back!"
silas,"We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru. That's why we've brought you here.  I am the League's director, Silas Ramsbottom."
tom,Bottom.
silas,Hilarious.     Agent Wilde...
lucy,"Oh, me now...?"
gru,I don't care.
lucy,"The lab was devoted to experiments involving PX-41, a transmutation serum. What is PX-41, you ask? Mmmm, it's pretty bad... Look."
gru,Oh!
silas,"As you can see, in the wrong hands, the PX-41 serum could be the most devastating weapon on earth.  Fortunately it has a very distinct chemical footprint, and using the latest chemtracking technology, we found traces of it in the Paradise Mall."
gru,Ha!   A mall?
silas,Precisely. And we believe that one of these shop owners is a master criminal.
lucy,"The plan is to set you up undercover at a shop in the mall, where hopefully you'll be able to--"
gru,"Okay, I see where this is going, with all the Mission Impossible stuff, but no. No! I am a father now. And a legitimate businessman. I am developing a line of delicious jams and jellies."
silas,Jams and...jellies?
gru,"Oh, attitude! That's right! So thanks, but no thanks.  And here's a tip--instead of tasing people and kidnapping them, maybe you should just give them a call! Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt!"
silas,Ramsbottom.
gru," Oh, yeah, like that's any better!"
lucy,"Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but your work as a villain was kind of amazing, so if you ever want to get back to doing something awesome--give us a call."
tom, Mack-oh! Mack-oh!    Mack-oh!
gru," Hey, I told you guys to get to bed."
margo,"Oh, sorry."
edith,So when ya goin' on your date?
gru,What?
edith,Remember? Miss Jillian said she was arranging a date for you.
gru,"Yeah, well, she is a nutjob.    And I'm not going on any date."
edith,Why not?    Are you scared?  Gru stares back at Edith.     Gets a far-away look in his eyes.
lisa," Hey, did you guys see the moon landing on TV?"
girls,"Yeah, I can't believe it.     It's so cool..."
lisa,"Yeah, and you know what--"
little gru,"Excuse me, Lisa?"
lisa, I was talking to Billy the other day.
girls,No way.
lisa,He is so cute.
gru,"Hey Lisa, I was wondering if you--"
girl,Ewww! Gru touched Lisa!         Gru touched Lisa!
girls,Eeeeewww!
gru,"Scared? Of what? Women?! No, that's bonkers! I just-- I have no interest in going on a date, that's all. Case closed. I'm not scared-- of women... or dates... let's go to bed."
margo,No one.   Just my friend Avery.
gru,Avery... Avery? Is that a girl's name or a boy's name?
margo,Does it matter?
gru,"No, no, it doesn't matter... Unless it's a boy!"
agnes,I know what makes you a boy.
gru,Uh...oooh...you...do?
agnes,Your bald head.
gru,"Oh, yes..."
agnes,It's really smooth. Sometimes I stare at it and imagine a little chick popping out. Peep peep peep.
gru,"Goodnight, Agnes.   Never get older."
supervisor minion,"Hey, oh!    Me banana!"
gru,"Hey, Tim, nice haircut!"
gru, Love the flavor of that...
gru,"No! No! Oh, we're making great progress!  Here, try some of this."
gru,What?   What's wrong?
gru,"Well, I'm also considering a line of jams..."
gru,"Dr. Nefario! Come on, you're kidding, right?"
gru,Very well. Let us give you the proper send-off.  Minions!
gru,The highest honor awarded. To Dr. Nefario for your years of service. The twenty-one fart gun salute!
agnes,Are you sure we should be doing this?
margo,"Yes, it's for his own good."
agnes,No.
edith,Weird.
girls,Aaaaaah!!!
agnes,What is that?!
gru,"Good morning, girls! I have an announcement to make."
margo,"Hey, what celebrity do you look like?"
gru,Ummm...Bruce Willis.
margo,Mmmm...no.
agnes,Humpty Dumpty!
edith,"Ooh, Gollum!"
gru,"Okay, what are you doing?"
agnes,We're signing you up for online dating!
gru,"Oh, okay...WHAT?! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
edith,"Aw come on, it's fun."
margo,And it's time for you to get out there.
gru,No! Stop!      No one is ever getting out there!     Ever!
margo,Whoa--really?
gru,"Yes, I have been recruited by a top secret agency to go undercover and save the world!"
edith,You're gonna be a spy?!
gru,"That's right, baby! Gru's back in the game! With gadgets and weapons and cool cars...the whole deal."
edith,Awesome!
agnes,Are you really gonna save the world?
gru,Yes.   Yes I am.
dave,Mocha!
kevin,Cacao!
stuart,Papadam?
gru,"Hm.     ""Bake My Day.""   Blech."
gru,"Alright, here is the cupcake recipe I got off the internet."
lucy,Ha! Yaa!      Ho! Ooof!   Zaaa!   Ay-ay- ay-ay-ay!
gru,"Alright, alright.    I got it.    I got it!... Stop it!"
lucy,Oh!     I'll let you get it.
gru,"Okay, that's weird--why are you here?"
lucy,On assignment from Silas.   I'm your new partner. Yay!
gru,"What?! No, no ""yay."" Ramsbottom didn't say anything about a partner."
lucy,"Well, seems that because of your checkered past, everyone else refused to work with you. But not me. I stepped up. And I'm new, so I kind of have to do what they tell me anyway."
dave,Walla!
lucy,You know this guy?
gru,"Yes, he's one of my minions."
lucy,"Oh, I'm sorry. I should have known."
gru,Earth to Dave!     You can leave now.
lucy,"First suspect...Hedda Blumentoft, proprietor of Mum's the Word Floral Shop."
gru,No.    Not her.
lucy,"Okay, moving on..."
gru,I don't think so.
gru,Oh!
eduardo,"Buenos dias, my friends! I am Eduardo Perez, owner of Salsa & Salsa Restaurant, across the mall. Now open for breakfast. And you are?"
gru,Gru. And this is Lucy.    And we are closed.
eduardo,"This is just gonna take un momento. I am throwing a big Cinco de Mayo party, and I am going to need two hundred of your best cupcakes decorated with the Mexican flag. It looks something like this."
gru,Look away!
lucy,You-- Whoa... Hooo...
eduardo,"Anyway, I have to go. It's all settled! I pick `em up next week! Have a good day. Come by if you get a chance, okay?"
gru, El Macho.
lucy,What?
gru,But it couldn't be...
lucy,Wha-- What? What couldn't be??
gru,That guy looks exactly like a villain named El Macho. From about twenty years ago.
lucy,"Yeah, sounds like El Macho's pretty dead..."
gru,They never found the body. Oh no. All that was ever retrieved was a pile of singed chest hair.  But... that face. It has got to be El Macho.
lucy,Then what do you say you and I break into his restaurant? Tonight.
gru,"Yes, that's good, because I'm telling you--if anybody in this place has the PX-41 serum...  Gru looks out the window and points at Eduardo riding up on the escalator, scratching his butt.  GRU  ...it's him."
gru,"Alright, alright, homework done, pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for bed."
margo,What's the big hurry?
gru,I just... I have a lot of work to do.
edith,"Work, what kind of work?"
gru,"Very important business. So...hugs, kisses...  ...good night, sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs blah-blah-blah-blah- blah--"
agnes,But you said you'd help me practice my part for the Mother's Day show!
gru,"Fine, fine... Let me hear it. Quickly."
agnes," She kisses my boo-boos She braids my hair My mother is beyond compare We love you, mothers, everywhere!"
gru,"Wow! That was...something else. I really liked the way you smiled at the end. Let's try this one more time, but a teensy bit less like a zombie, okay?"
agnes,Okay.  She kisses my boo-boos She braids my hair--
gru,Perfect!   Time to go!
agnes,I don't think I should do this.
gru,"Well, what do you mean?    Why not?"
agnes,I don't even have a mom.
gru,"Well, you don't need one to do the show. I mean, you did the Veterans Day Pageant and you haven't been in combat."
agnes,This is different.
gru,"Okay, well, then...maybe you can just use your imagination."
agnes,You mean I pretend I have a mom?
gru,"Yes, right. You can do that, can't you?"
agnes,"Yeah! I do that all the time! Thanks, Gru!"
minions,Hey!
gru,"Alright, hey, hey--   No, no, no, no! Hey, please!  The Minions stop singing.  GRU  Come on!  Once they are gone, the Minions go back to singing and laughing."
kevin,"Hey, putt-putt?"
jerry,Oh!
kevin,"Una, doo-- "
kevin,Boca!
jerry, Boca!
kevin,Looka too!
gru, We're stealth ninjas.    We make no sound.
lucy,Right.   Gotcha.
gru,"Alright, El Macho, you're going down."
lucy,Wait!    Wait!
gru,What?
lucy,I'm checking for laser beam alarm triggers.
gru,It's a restaurant!
lucy,You never know what kind of booby traps this guy could have set. Huh? C'mon!
gru,There are no booby traps!
lucy,Ha!   Booby!
gru,Ha!   Some guard dog.
lucy,I got it!     Ha!
gru, Ugh...
lucy,"What is wrong with that chicken?  Hey, that pollo? Es loco."
gru,You getting anything?
lucy,"No. Not yet. But hey, maybe you can find something with these x-ray goggles."
gru, Bah...
gru,Ahh!   Ooof!
lucy,What's wrong? Something wrong?
gru,"Oh, that's an image I'll never get out of my brain. Blagh!"
lucy,"Ooh, then let's get it!"
gru," Oh, this is going to be good! Ahh..."
lucy, Awww man.
eduardo,Oh... somebody's going to die tonight.

eduardo,Who would do this to such a sweet little chicken? What? Who's there?
eduardo,You coming out?! Or am I gonna go in?!

gru,"Lucy, these are my girls, Margo, Edith and Agnes. Girls, Lucy. Lucy, girls."
margo,Hello.
edith,Hi.
agnes,Are you single?
lucy,Oh!   Goodness...
gru,"Oh! Hey! I have an idea! Since Lucy and I have lots of work to do, why don't you girls go and explore the mall!"
agnes,Are you gonna marry Lucy?
gru,Are you out of your gourd?    No! She just works with me.
agnes,"Plus you love her.  You love her, you love her, you really really love her, and you're gonna get married, and I will be the flower girl, and--"
gru,"Okay, stop! That is a song of lies. I don't even like her!  Now go have fun!"
agnes,Almost forgot! Hugs!
margo,Good luck saving the world.   Bye!
agnes,"Bye, Gru!"
gru,"Ha, ha, ha! Kids...right? They're...funny."
lucy,Those girls totally adore you.       I bet you're a fun dad.
gru,Huh.  I am pretty fun.
agnes,Is that stealing?
edith,Not if my wish was that I would get a lot of free coins.
margo,Whoa!
antonio,Cool glasses.
margo,I'm...Margo.
antonio,I was just going to get a cookie. Care to join me?
margo,"Uh, sure.    I'm...Margo."
edith,Can I be the first to say...Ewwww!
agnes,We gotta go tell Gru!
gru,"All right, I'm going in."
lucy,--will make a sound like this-- MEE- MO-MEE-MO-MEE-MO!!!
gru, Okay! I get it!     I get it!
gru,You...know my name?
floyd," When someone moves into the mall who is follically challenged, I make it my business to know all about them. You are bald. And that is bad."
lucy,I'm getting nothing so far. I think you need to move around.
gru,"Wow, this looks interesting.     What is it?"
floyd,I take it you're an art lover?
gru,"Yeah, not so much."
floyd,"I'd hardly call it a trinket, Mr. Gru."
lucy, Nothing.
floyd,The International--
gru,"Yeah, I don't care."
lucy, MEE-MO-MEE-MO-MEE-MO!!! Hold on. I'm picking up something! Behind that wall!
gru,Ah!    And what do we have here?
floyd,These are my trial wigs.  You should take one.
gru,No thanks. So what's on the other side of the wall?
floyd,Here you are! Look at me!     Focus!
lucy, Gru?
floyd,I promise that this wig will transform you from ugly to irresistible.
agnes,MARGO HAS A BOYFRIEND!
edith,AND THEY'RE GOING ON A DATE!
gru,Date??? Boyfriend???  What???
agnes,There she goes!
margo,"Oh, you're so funny..."
edith,"Gross!    Look, they're in love!"
gru,"Oh, no, no, no! Do not say that they are...no no no, no!"
margo,Wow.    You're so complicated.
gru,Margo.    What is going on here?
margo,"Oh! Gru, se llama Antonio.       Me llamo Margo."
gru,"Me llama-lama-ding-dong, who cares. Let's go."
margo,Whoa!
eduardo,Kids eat free on Tuesdays.
girls,Yeah!   Wahoo! Cool!   Awesome!
eduardo,"So good to see you again, mi compadre!"
antonio,"Oh, I see you have already met my father."
gru,What the-- Father?!
eduardo,"Si! Look at this crazy small world we live in, eh? Come, sit, let me get you something."
gru,Oh... look at you.
eduardo,"Oh, oh, I'm sorry, Pollito is usually very friendly.  He had a rough night."
gru,"Well, we really should be going. Girls, come on."
eduardo,"That is a pity. Young love is beautiful, no?"
gru,"No!  You know, they're not in love. They hardly know each other!"
eduardo,"You are right, Cabeza de Huevo! They must get to know each other better. Antonio, why don't you invite your girlfriend and her family to our Cinco de Mayo party?"
gru,"No, no, I am--"
girls,Si!
silas,"I'm sorry, El Macho? Hadn't we eliminated him as a suspect? After the whole salsa incident?"
gru,"Yes, but there has been a new development, and I'm telling you, this is the guy. You need to arrest him immediately. And his deviously charming son. I'm pretty sure that the son is involved, too. The son also. You've got to get the son."
silas,"Yes, but I don't really see any evidence for--"
gru,"Evidence schmevidence! I go with my gut, and my gut tells me that this guy is El Macho! Lock him up! Lock up the son. Don't forget about the son. The kid gives me the creeps!"
silas,"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear..."
lucy,"Uh, but, on the less...  ...""crazy"" side of things, uh, Gru discovered traces of the serum at Eagle Hair Club."
silas,Hm...    Interesting...
lucy,"Yeah, and you know who made that happen? Huh?  This guy. Nailed it. Amazing, right?"
gru,"No. I mean, sure, but it's not him. It is...  ...El Macho."
silas,Mr. Gru.     Please--
gru,No.   It is him!   And I will prove it!
lucy," Gru, c'mon!"
popsicle minion,Koonga!
gru,"Kevin, the wi-fi's out!     Kevin?"
jillian,"I have my friend Shannon here with me! I was thinking you two could get some grub, you know, tear it up! See what happens!"
gru,Agnes! Agnes!     Tell Jillian I'm not here!
agnes,Gru's not here!
jillian,Are you sure?
agnes,Yes!   He just told me!
jillian, Agnes--where is Gru?
agnes,He's putting on lipstick!
shannon,"I have to tell you, I was so nervous about tonight. I mean there's just so many phonies out there!"
gru,"Yes, I hear you. "
shannon,"Oh, so do you work out?"
gru,Well...
shannon,"I mean, obviously, you don't, but would you consider it? Huh? "
gru,Ah.   I can tell.
shannon, Solid.
gru,"We are in a restaurant, you know."
lucy,Hi.   Takeout for Lucy?
hostess,"Sure, just a sec."
shannon,Your accent is so exotic.
gru,"Ah. Well, thank you very much.      I was--"
shannon,I know someone who can fix that for you. And you'll be talking normal in no time.
gru,Hahaha. Hoooo. Is it hot in here? Oof. How's the food?
shannon,Wait a minute. Wait a minute.      Are you wearing a wig?
gru, I don't think so.
shannon,I knew it.     You're a phony.   I hate phonies.
gru,Oh. What? No.      These locks are all mine...
shannon,No they're not! You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna rip that thing off your head and show everyone what a bald-headed phony you are.
lucy,"I don't think so, Miss Lady."
gru,"Hello... Hello, are you...?"
gru,"Hello, Lucy, how you doin'...?"
lucy," Wow, looks like your date's out for the count. It's like she's been shot with a mild moose tranquilizer."
italian waiter," `Scusi, whassa happenin' here?    She no like?"
lucy,"Oh, she's just uh-- "
italian waiter," Oh, oh, si, si..."
lucy,Shall we take her home?
lucy,"Well, I think you did it. You just officially had the worst date ever."
gru,"Huh, tell me about it."
lucy,"Don't worry--it can only get better from here, right? But if it doesn't, you can always borrow my dart gun. I've had to use it on one or two dates myself."
gru,"Yeah, you know, as far as dates go, I think I'm good with just the one."
lucy,"Well, good night, partner."
gru,"Yes.   Surprisingly, it was."
lucy,"Oh, and uh, just between you and me? You look much better bald."
gru,Quack!     Quack!    Quack!
agnes,Yeah!
margo,So I take it the date went well?
gru,No!   It was horrible!
gru,High-five!
gru, Mr. Ramsbottom?
silas,"Oh, hello."
gru,What are you doing here?
silas,We got him.
gru,Got who?
silas,"Floyd Eaglesan! Our agents located a secret room in his shop last night, and uh, discovered this!"
floyd,I was framed! You won't get away with this! Get your mitts off of me! I am a legitimate businessman!
gru,Ah.   Alright. So...what now?
silas,"Well, now you're free to go back to your ""business."" Mmmm. Jams and jellies. And it looks like Agent Wilde will be transferring to our Australian branch."
gru, Australia...?
silas,"Yes. But thank you--for everything. And by everything of course I mean...nothing.  Toodle pip and cheerio, Mr. Gru."
lucy,Hey there.
gru,Hey.
lucy,So...we got him.
gru,Yay.  That's great.  And now you're going to Australia?
lucy,"Well, it's not definite yet. Still figuring it out. Already been working on my accent.  So...um. Pretty excited..."
gru,Great.   Well...good luck.
lucy,Thanks. You too.  Oh. Here. I wanted to give you this.
gru,Your lipstick taser?
lucy,"Yeah, it's just a memento. Just, you know, from the first time we met."
gru,"Oh.    Thank you, Lucy."
gru,"Well... it looks like they need you, so..."
lucy,"Yeah, I uh, I better go.    Bye, Gru."
agnes,I brought you an umbrella.
gru,"Ah, thank you."
agnes,What're you doing out here?
gru,"Remember when you said that I liked Lucy? Well, it turns out...you're right."
agnes,Really?
gru,"Yes, but...well, she's moving away.  I'm never going to see her again."
agnes,Is there anything I can do to help?
gru,"Oh, I don't--I don't think so, sweetheart."
agnes,"Well, is there anything you could do?"
gru,"""Hello, Lucy. This is Gru. I know up to this point our relationship has been strictly professional, and you're leaving for Australia and all, but...""  Okay, here is the question. ""Would you like to--to go out on a date?"""
dave,"Eh, no."
gru,"Okay, that's not helping."
siren minion,Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo! Beedo!
kevin,Tom?
kevin,Oh...
edith,Whoa!   This place is awesome!
gru,Okay. Let's party. Ah? But first let's go over the rules. Because what is fun without the rules?
edith,Hai!
gru,Margo--
antonio,"Hello, Mr. Gru."
gru,Aghhh!    Okay...
margo,Gru!
gru,There must be the standard six feet of space between you and boys.  Especially this boy.
antonio, Come on! They're starting the dance!
agnes, Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriba!
gru,"Oh, nothing. Nothing is wrong. I'm just chilling with the guac...from my chip hat."
eduardo,"Gru, please. I know that look all too well. It is the look of a broken heart."
gru,How did you know?
eduardo,"Believe me, my friend, I too have spent many nights trying to drown my sorrows in guacamole."
gru,You?
el macho,Yes. But we are survivors. There's much more to us than meets the eye. Enjoy the party.
gru,What the--oh!  Gru observes the destroyed sombrero in his hands.  GRU  Ouch!
lucy,Say what?
gru baby,I just did a boom boom.
flight attendant,"I really need you to make a choice, hon."
lucy,I choose Gru.  I CHOOSE GRU!
flight attendant,You're welcome!
gru,Ha ha!    I knew it!   You are El Macho!
el macho,That's right!
gru,Nobody believed me! Ho ho!     But I knew you weren't dead!
el macho," But now it's time for me to make a spectacular return to evil! Doctor, I think it's time we showed Gru what we're up to here."
gru,Dr. Nefario?
gru,"Whaaat? This-- So, this is your new job opportunity?"
el macho,"Sorry--I had to borrow some of your minions, but it was for a worthy cause."
gru,Oh!   Kevin? Agh!
el macho,"No, he's not Kevin anymore. Now he is an indestructible, mindless killing machine!"
kevin,Blah!
el macho,Just watch this!
gru,Together?
el macho,"Together! I have admired your work for years, amigo. Stealing the moon?! Are you kidding?! We would be unstoppable! Men like you, men like me, we should be ruling the world!  So, are you in?"
gru,Uh...yeah...probably...
el macho,Probably?
gru,"I mean, yes! Yes. Of course, yes, I just have a lot going on right now...I just need to get some things off my plate before we start taking over the world, that's all."
el macho,`Scuse me?
gru,"No--no, forget it! One hundred percent! I am in!  I think--what is--do you hear that-- I do. That's Agnes calling me from on the surf--"
el macho,You know what? I am not so convinced that he is in.
kevin,Blah!
gru,Edith!   Agnes!      Come on!
edith,Sorry.
gru,We need to go home now!    Where's Margo?
agnes,But I didn't get a turn!
gru,Margo!
margo,I hate boys.
gru,"Yes...they stink.   Sorry, honey, we've got to go."
lucy,"Oops, sorry!"
lucy,"Oh, hey!   Eduardo!"
el macho,"Lucia! I apologize. Pollito, he's usually not like this. The same thing happened the other day with... with Gru and..."
lucy,"Oh, speaking of Gru...uh, have you seen him? I really need to talk to him."
el macho,"Yes, I think he's somewhere around here. You two are close, no?"
lucy,"Oh, I don't know. I mean close... I wouldn't say we were close. Why, did he say we were close? Did he say that?"
el macho,"It's more what he didn't say. For instance, he never mentioned...that you were both working for the Anti- Villain League!!!"
lucy,Hey!
edith,So Eduardo's actually El Macho? Cool!
gru,"No, it is not cool. Plus, I pretty much knew it was him all along, so if anyone's cool, it's me."
gru,"Well, Dr. Nefario..."
gru,Lucy? Wha--that's impossible! She's on her way to Australia...
agnes,He's got Lucy?
gru, Not for long.
agnes,What was that?
margo,I don't see anything.
agnes,My unicorn!
margo,"Agnes, no!"
margo,C'mon!   Hurry!
agnes,Whoa!
edith,What's the matter?
agnes,Whoa!
kevin,Ooh-la-la!     Pilatos?
agnes,Kevin!
margo,Dr. Nefario! You're back!
gru,"Hey, guys.     Come on!   Stay focused here!"
minions,"Okay, okay."
gru, Curses. Foiled again. These guys captured me.
gru,"Up that tree! Hurry, hurry!"
gru,"Hey, hey!    Nice work, Dr. Nefario!"
gru,"Thank you, Doctor!   Now let's go get the--"
agnes,Hi!
gru,You brought the girls?
edith,Wooooo!    Yeeeaaahhh!
el macho,Oh no! What's happening to my minions?  Gru?
gru,You guys take care of the rest of the minions.  I'm going to find Lucy.
agnes,"Eat jelly, you purple freaks! Waaaaah!"
gru,"It's over, El Macho.   Now where is Lucy?"
el macho, Let me show you.
lucy,"Oh, hey Gru! Turns out you were right about the whole El Macho thing, huh?  Yay!"
el macho,One push of this button and I send that rocket straight into the same volcano where I faked my death. Only this time--it's for real!
gru, No!
dave,Tally ho!
el macho,"We could've ruled the world together, Gru. But now--you're gonna die."
gru,Lipstick taser!
lucy,Aw...he copied me.
el macho, I am not afraid of your jelly guns.
lucy,"Don't worry about me, Gru! I'll be fine. I have survived lots worse than this.  Okay, that's not entirely true. I'm actually kind of freaking out up here!"
gru,Don't worry--I will get you out of this!
lucy,Is there a red one?   It's usually the red one.
gru,"Listen, Lucy--we may not get out of this alive, so I need to ask you a question."
lucy,"Uh, better make it quick!"
gru,"If I'd asked you out on a date, what would you have said?"
lucy,Are you kidding me?!   Yes!
gru,JUMP!!!
lucy,Gru!
tom, Mack-oh! Mack-oh!      Mack-oh!
gru,They'll be back...
edith,Can I be the first to say--ewwww!
agnes,Okay.
evil minion,Blaaaaah!
