chairman," Carter McCoy, one to five years sentence for armed robbery, first offense in the State of Texas, wanted by the State of Ohio for assault with a deadly weapon and armed robbery..."

chairman,Notice is taken.
doc,His face is taut.
second man, Request for parole is denied. The prisoner may re-apply in one calendar year.

chairman,Mr. Doty is serving five to twelve years for embezzlement of corporate funds.

doc, I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
carol,You want to drive?
doc,"My license expired, let's get out of here."
carol,Sure...
carol,I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
doc,It looks fine.
carol,Feel good?
10.,CONTINUED:
doc,Yeah.
carol,Where do you want to go?
doc,I want to take a walk.
doc, It doesn't look like that.
carol,What do you mean? You've never been there.
doc,I've been there every day for the last four years.
carol,"Small town, small bank, big money."
doc,Where did you get those?
carol,I've been doing my homework.
doc,Just like old times?
carol,Better than old times.
doc,I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
carol,I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
doc, Where did you get them developed?
12.,CONTINUED: 
carol,Assumed name... Houston.
doc,Good.
carol,Half a million.
doc,That Beynon's got a long arm.
carol, What do you want for dinner?
doc,Whisky and a peach.
carol, How does it taste?
doc,Just the way I remembered.
carol,"Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel."
doc,How's Estelle?
carol,Fatter... some things never change.
doc,Boring.
carol,Nothing's been boring since you found me.
doc, That's not all of it.
carol,No. It's been a long time.

carol," I'm still here, Doc."
doc, Oh Christ...
14.,CONTINUED:

doc, It's just been a while.

doc,I'll be okay.
carol,"Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are."

carol, I couldn't have... much longer.
doc,Yeah... I know.
carol,"But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out."
doc,Why are you laughing?

doc,That doesn't hurt.
carol,But sometimes I cried a lot too.
doc, I didn't. I just waited.
carol, Want to cry now?
doc,You gotta be kidding.
beynon,"Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch."
doc,All it takes is a long arm.
beynon,Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
doc, I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
beynon,"This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him..."
doc, I get my own help.
beynon," You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up."

beynon, Stay clean.
carol,I'd like an application for a checking account.
doc, Could I get change for this fifty please?
doc,"... Bank President, three tellers and one guard..."
carol, Usually on the right side as you go in.
doc,"Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns."
carol,For exits off Main Street.
doc,Should be light traffic that time of day... the Bank Guard carries a .38. These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards.

doc,I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollies. Okay. Any questions?
rudy,Aren't we going a little hard?
doc,What do you have in mind?
rudy,It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
doc, Dillinger got killed.
accountant,I understand.
doc,Beynon has to be alone at the drop ... one car at the ranch and that's it. I won't have the money... she won't know where it is until I'm sure it's clear.
accountant,He understands.
doc,Make sure everybody does.
carol,You know how I feel?
doc,My mind's not on guessing games.
carol,Promise you won't laugh.
doc, If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
carol,I feel like the night before the first day of school.
doc,That bad?
carol,It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
doc,Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
carol,You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
doc,At least you were outside.
carol,"It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc."
doc,Bullshit.
carol,I mean it.
doc,I know you do. But it is different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
carol,We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.

Doc is squatted down, quickly activating another timing mechanism, checking the clock-face on the bomb against his wristwatch... with a quick, dexterous movement, he places a bomb into the two large grocery bags at his feet. After burying the explosives within each sack, he covers the bombs with crumpled wastepaper. "

DOC'S PACE TIGHTENS. The cars behind the van continue HONKING.  CAROL - AGAIN GRINDING AWAY AT THE ENGINE. Her lips are compressed into a thin line... After a moment... the motor catches, the truck again moves forward.  DOC PICKS UP THE LARGE BLACK SUITCASE from the floor of the panel truck, then begins to move toward the cab and Carol.  THE PANEL TRUCK WHIPS OFF MAIN STREET and onto a side avenue. Carol pulls the van up to the curbway, jerking to a stop.  DOC IS NOW IN THE FRONT SEAT BESIDE CAROL. He pulls the truck door open, then hesitates. He touches her arm, their eyes meet briefly, both their faces warming for a moment. Doc gives her a casual wink then quietly exits the truck.  ON THE SIDEWALK  DOC TURNS AND BEGINS WALKING toward an open alleyway. Behind him the panel truck pulls smoothly away.  WALKING UP THE ALLEY - DOC PULLS ON A PAIR OF BLACK GLOVES. He turns again, now moving down a totallydeserted side alley.  The alley opens at one end onto a back street; the opposite end is bounded by a large brick building. Doc removes his pistol from his coat pocket, then approaches a doorway along the side of the brick building. At the last moment he pulls down the watch cap mask.  INT.

carol,"Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --"
doc,Why?
carol,There are three men dead.
doc,So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
carol,He might be ready to chop us up.
doc,Do it my way.
doc,Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
carol,"I've never ""been there... When we met it was in his office."
doc,I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
carol,Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
doc,"If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up."
carol,I don't want to go there.

doc,That's your problem.
beynon," You know, you and I may be two of a kind."
doc,No way. I always do my own work.
beynon,"Here. I understand the way you feel. As a matter of fact, you and I might share a great many feelings..."
doc, I'm in a hurry.
beynon,You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
doc,No applause!
beynon,"Let's examine the situation. One, an extremely attractive woman. Then, there's the woman's husband, a skillful bank robber serving a long sentence in prison. Three, a man with political influence, a man who can easily get a parole for a convict... why should he?"
doc,I knew that life didn't add up to the
beynon, What do you add up to here?
doc,One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
beynon,"A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts."
doc,So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
beynon, But we are both not interested in that right now.
doc,No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
beynon,Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
doc,I bet.
beynon,You wouldn't have come here when you were eight3 Mr. McCoy.
doc, Get it over with...
doc,Stupid.
carol,There wasn't any way to explain it.

carol,What do we do?
doc, We keep going.

soldier,"Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home."
carol,Where's home?
soldier,"Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?"
