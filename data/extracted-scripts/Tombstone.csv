morgan,"Like you said, Wyatt.  We're Brothers.  Gotta back your Brother's play.  Just did like I Figured you would."
wyatt,"Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White."
morgan,"Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all."

morgan,"Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt."
wyatt,"All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg."
morgan,What're you talkin' about?
wyatt,"All the years I worked the Cowtowns, I was only ever mixed Up in one shooting.  Just one.  A Man got killed.  Wasn't my fault, Just doin' my job.  I don't even Know if it was my bullet that Dropped him, but... I don't kno, It's sort of hard to explain.  At First I just felt funny, you Know, kind of clammy inside.  But When it finally sunk in what I'd Done... Believe me, boy, you Don't ever want to feel that way. Not ever.  You're both makin' a big mistake."
wyatt,This Hooker's ranch?
hooker,That's right.  And I'm Hooker.
wyatt,You seen anything of a man on Horseback leading a black Stallion?
wyatt,"Well you must've seen somethin', The trail runs right by your Waterhole.  Oh, I see.  So it must've been a Cowboy, right?  Really got you People treed, don't they?"
hooker,"Look, Mister, it's fine for you Boomers to court trouble, you're Just passin' through.  Us Cattlemen gotta live here.  Best I Can do's point you up to the cut. That's their roost."
mcmasters,"Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!"
wyatt,"McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-"
mcmasters,"Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither."
wyatt,"I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back"
mcmasters,"Well in that case, I saw your Horse.  Billy Clanton was takin' Him up to the Cut to show him Off.  The boys're all up there Right now, branding.  And in a Mood.  Still want your property Back, Mr. Private Citizen?"
wyatt,So what about you Cowboys anyway?
mcmasters,If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
wyatt,"Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done..."
mcmasters,"There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher."
mcmasters,You seem like a nice fella.  Like To've know you better.  Had you lived.
ike,"Hey, law-dog.  The hell you doin' here?"
swilling,How 'bout I just drag you off That horse and eat you blood raw?
wyatt,Where'd you get that horse?
billy,"Beauty, ain't he?"
wyatt,I asked where you got him.

wyatt,"Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours."

virgil,"Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?"
wyatt,Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.

wyatt,Know why you're here?
vermillion,"Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers."
wyatt,"They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory."
johnson,Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
wyatt, I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
wyatt,"Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen."
vermillion, 500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
johnson,You crazy?  It can't be done.
mcmasters,"It might be done.  If we hit the Waterholes through the southern Dragoons, the Whetstones and Huachucas, we could take 'em on In pieces, run off their herds.  Keep your money, I'll show you Where those waterholes are.  Just Promise me you'll finish it.  No Matter what happens you'll see it Through to the end.  I'll have Your hand on that."
vermillion,"We come through this in one Piece, can we keep the horses?"
johnson,"Crapped out.  Okay, we're in."
wyatt,The minute we start we'll be Going against local and county Law.  If we fail the U.S. Government won't be able to lift A finger to help us.  Nevertheless I want you to understand we carry The full force and authority of The law of this land.
wyatt,"Raise your right hands.  Do you Solemnly swear to uphold the laws And constitution of the United States of America and to protect her citizens to the best of your Ability, even at the cost of your Own life?"
doc,Oh... All right.
doc,You know why I'm here.  My Hypocrisy only goes so far.
lucinda,Wait!
lucinda,Your colors.
wagonmaster,"Good luck, boys.  And give 'em hell!"
lucinda's son,"Wyatt Earp, the two-gun man, Whistling death and bloody Murder!  Wyatt the widow-maker, Avenging and bright, purple Poison on horseback with Lightning in his eye and thunder In his heart!  Wyatt and his he- Devils, holy terrors and true, Five black centaurs blowin' fire And quicksilver!  Ride out and Charge and shoot and strike and Cleave and hack and thrust home! Don't let up and give no rest and Never call retreat till the last One's smashed and smote and Runnin' for cover.  Best 'em all And break 'em up and bang their Heads together in a bunch and Give no quarter though they be Ten times ten thousand!"
illinois mother,What're you doing?
illinois father,Someday he'll be able to say he Was there when Wyatt Earp rode Out to bring the law.
wyatt,"All right, let's wring 'em out!"
johnson,"Like flyin', son.  Just like flyin'."
pony deal,Maybe they smell a wolf.

mcmasters,"I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!"
wyatt,"All right, run 'em off."
swilling,Bastard!  Stinkin' bastard!  Like To eat you blood raw!
wyatt,"All right, breed.  Dig in."
doc,It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
wyatt, Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
mcmasters,Florentino!  He's getting away!
wyatt,Drop his horse.
florentino,"I don't kill your brother!  I Don't even know him.  I was only Lookout.  It was money, they give Me twelve dollars!  It was money!"
wyatt,A human life.  Twelve dollars.
florentino,No!
wyatt,"Look at him.  That's how you'll All end up if you don't get it Through your head: it's over, The Cowboys're finished.  Forever. So tell the others and get out of The Territory 'cause next time I Leave no one alive.  Understand? No one.  You been warned.  All right, burn it!  Everything!"
wyatt,Leave that trash where it lays.
vermillion,"You know, we might just pull this off."
johnson,Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
wyatt,I know that cut.  You mean there's A waterhole near there?
mcmasters,But this time they'll be ready.
wyatt,We'll see about that.
pony deal,"Keep your eyes open for Earp's Bunch.  Swear to God, ain't gonna Get the drop on us this time."
doc,They saw us.  Here they come.
wyatt,Wait... wait... steady...
wyatt,Now!
wyatt,Lay on!
pony deal,Run!

vermillion,Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
doc,Wyatt Earp is my friend.
vermillion,"Hell, I got lot's of friends."
doc, I don't.
johnson,"Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it."
wyatt,There's no reasoning with him.
mcmasters, Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
wyatt,"They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs."
mcmasters,There they are.  No herd though.
wyatt,"We'll go around that way, come up on foot."
mcmasters,Ambush!  Get down!
johnson,Christ!
curly bill,"Hey, Wyatt!  How the hell are you?"
doc,Look!
curly bill,"Got some boys workin' around Those rocks behind you.  Another Minute or two, gonna have you in A crossfire!  How do you like that?"

johnson, How is he?
doc, I don't believe it.  He's clean!
vermillion,What?  But I saw 'em-
doc,"I'm telling you, there isn't a Mark on him."
doc,"I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?"
wyatt,"I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know."
vermillion,"Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?"
johnson,Never even heard of anything like it.
vermillion,I just thought of somethin' I Never thought about before.  I don't want to go to hell.
vermillion,"Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?"
wyatt,Sure...
johnson,"One thing.  We come through this Alive, can we keep the badges?"
mcmasters,Where's Wyatt?
doc,Down at the creek.  Walking on water.
ringo,Curly Bill?  He killed Curly Bill?

ringo,"Everybody get this through their Heads.  Wyatt Earp dies.  I'm Running the show now and I'm Telling you, Earp dies.  His men Too.  They all die.  Understand? We're gonna kill 'em.  For what They did to Curly Bill we're Gonna ride 'em into the ground And slaughter 'em like rabbits. 'Cause this is my time, children. This is where I get woolly."
grounds,"What d'you think?  I didn't think Curly Bill could be killed.  I'm Tellin' you, this whole thing's Gone sour.  We got hands droppin' Like flies and Ringo's flat out Of his mind.  I mean, hell Brother, you feel like ridin' Against Wyatt Earp?"
hunt,"Hell no, brother."
grounds,Then brother let's you and me cut out.
hunt,"Right with you, brother."
behan,"Are you crazy?  It's front page News all over the country.  It's Getting out of hand, Ringo.  If Things don't settle down soon-"
ringo,"You heard me, Behan."
behan,"Ringo, you don't understand-"
ringo,"No, you don't understand."
ringo,Who cares?  Separate the wheat From the chaff.
behan,"What're you doing here, Billy?"
breakenridge,Curly Bill was my friend.  I'd Like to come with you.

hooker,You can put up at my ranch if you want.
hooker,I'm no doctor but he looks pretty bad.
hunt,"What's it gonna be, brother?"
grounds,"I don't care.  Colorado, New Mexico, 'long as we're out of the Territory."
hunt,Just what we need.  Travelin' money.
behan,"Robbery.  2 men stuck 'em up and Killed a passenger.  One of 'em Rode a Mexican saddle, the other Had a Mother Hubbard.  Billy Grounds and Zwing Hunt."
breakenridge,"Oh, no..."
josephine,"We're headed for a booking in Denver.  They tried to take my Watch.  He cursed them for cowards And they shot him.  He may've been Vain and an actor but he was Better than all of you.  And Gentler and braver.  I don't Understand any of this, I only Know it's ugly.  You're all ugly And he was beautiful, he tried to Put something fine into your ugly World and you killed him for it. Anyway the ones who did it are headed north.  Not that you care."
behan,Where're you going?  Get back here!
billy,"I'm sorry, sir, but we got to Have some law."

josephine,I have to go.
wyatt,Wait!
wyatt,Goodbye.
wyatt,Damn... Damn!
wyatt,"See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason."
johnson,"Good God, you're really-"
wyatt,"Cards in spades.  I'm in love with Every second of her life.  Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust."
hunt,"No fire tonight, son.  Too many Riders out."
hunt,Who's that?
breakenridge,It's Deputy Breakenridge.
hunt,"Sister Boy!  Thank God, we was afraid-"
breakenridge,You shouldn't've killed Mr. Fabian.  You shouldn't've done That.  It was wrong.  I'm takin' You both in for it.
hunt,"What?  You gotta be kiddin'.  Look, Just go home 'fore you get hurt."
breakenridge,Don't want to kill you but I will If I have to.  I'm warning you.
grounds,"No, I'm warning you, Sister Boy!"
breakenridge,Don't try it!
grounds,"Sister Boy, just go to hell!"
breakenridge,Sorry.
hooker,...brought 'em in draped over their saddles.  Little Billy Breakenridge.  Sister Boy.  He done It.  So I guess the law's finally Arrived in southeast Arizona.
ringo,"Hooker's got around 15 or 16 Hands.  We could take 'em right Enough but it might be a mess. Keep the place bottled up for Now, see if we can figure a way To flush 'em."
behan,"It's too much!  It's completely Out of hand!  Governor Gosper's Talking about asking the President to send in the Army! Listen Ringo, you've got to get This over with and you've got to Do it now.  One way or another."
wyatt,We should get moving.
vermillion,Doc's just in no kinda shape.
hooker,"Don't have to bother about that. Took a vote.  Cowboys or not, you Can stay here as long as you want. Anyway maybe you done enough.  I Mean you whittled 'em down Considerable, now there's talk of Sendin' the Army in here.  Ask me, You done enough."
mcmasters,"He didn't figure on all the stink This is causin'.  Might be he's lookin' to strike a bargain.  If So, he probably figures he needs Somebody like me who talks his Language.  Could be we got him."
wyatt,I don't like it.
mcmasters,"Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you."
ringo,"Well hello, Sherm."
mcmasters,You wanted to talk?
ringo,"Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us."
mcmasters,That what you got me up here for?
ringo,"You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings."
mcmasters,"Forget it, Ringo."
ringo,Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
mcmasters,'Least they don't scare women.
ringo,"You're the boss.  One thing, though."
ringo,How you gonna get back to 'em?
vermillion,Why couldn't they've jus killed him?
wyatt,You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
johnson,"Wyatt, are you crazy?"
wyatt,I made a promise.
vermillion,"Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill."
johnson,"He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him."
wyatt,"But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would."
johnson,"All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!"
wyatt,"What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?"
doc,A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
wyatt,So what does he want?
doc,What does he want?  He wants revenge.
wyatt,Revenge?  For what?
doc,Being born.
wyatt,"Remember how I said it all Happened so fast with Curly Bill I didn't have time to think about it? Well I've had plenty of time To think about this.  I spent most Of my life since I was born not Knowing what I want out of life, Just chasin' my tail.  But now, For the first time I know exactly What I want.  And who.  And that's The damnable misery of it.  I can't beat him, can I?"
doc,"No, wait, I'll go with you..."
doc,"I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry."
wyatt,"That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry."
doc,Never got to wear one of those.
hooker,Don't worry.  They want him They'll have to go over us first.
ringo,Only three.  They left somebody Behind.  Let's go take a look.
hooker,What're you doin' here?
ringo,Who's in there?
hooker,It's Holliday.  He's sick.  Imagine He's dyin'.
ringo,"Drag him out here, let's have a look."
hooker,I looked the other way when you Did a lot of foul things but I Ain't lettin' you torment a dyin' Man.  Not as long as he's under my Roof.  I draw the line there.
ringo,"All right, Hooker.  I'll be back In about an hour.  We'll see how Brave you are then."
hooker,I'll be here.
ringo,"Soon as I'm through with Wyatt, Swarm down with the whole bunch And finish off Creek Johnson and Texas Jack."
ike,Get ready.  Soon as Ringo's done We're gonna take care of the others.
behan,Aren't we giving them safe conduct?
ike,Sure we are.  All the way to hell.
wyatt,They're not givin' you any safe Conduct.  Soon as the shooting Starts kick east for the New Mexico line.  Well...
johnson,"Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words."
wyatt,I know.  Me neither.
wyatt,"Dear God, this is the last Battle.  I worked it out in my Head every which way and I know There's no way I'm comin' through This alive.  You've preserved me This far so I only ask one more Favor: just let me live long Enough to kill that man.  Thy will Be done and there's an amen to it."
ringo,"Well, didn't think you had it in you.  Shall we?"
dark silhouette,I'm your huckleberry.
doc,"Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out."
ringo,"My fight's not with you, Holliday."
doc,"I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?"
ringo,I was kidding about that.
doc,I wasn't.  And this time it's legal.
ringo,"All right, lunger.  Let's do it."
doc,Say when.
doc,Come on!  Come on!
doc,"Oh Johnny.  You're no daisy, no Daisy at all."
wyatt,What happened?
doc,"Poor soul, he was so high-strung. Afraid the strain was more than He could bear."
doc,Let's go!  My horse is over here.
vermillion,Praise Jesus!
johnson,"I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too."
ike,"All right, get ready..."
wyatt,"All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way."
johnson,Colorado's closer
wyatt,"So're the Cowboys.  They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us."
vermillion,"We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-"
johnson,"It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end."
doc,I just wanted to see what it felt Like.  Here...
behan,Well I guess Ringo did it.
behan,What?
behan,"Oh, no..."
behan,Me too!
ike,Kill 'em!  Kill 'em!  It's only Four men!  Why don't you kill 'em?
doc,"Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds."
wyatt,"How you feelin', Doc?"
doc,"Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?"
wyatt, Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
doc,"I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties."
wyatt,"All right, Doc..."
doc,"You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope."
wyatt,All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
doc,When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
wyatt,That's great coming from you.
doc,"I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative."
wyatt,Then what do I do?
doc,First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
wyatt,All right.  Then what?
doc,"Run.  Take that girl and start Running.  Run and don't look back. All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By.  This time run and don't look Back and call it living.  Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt.  Live, Wyatt...  Live for me."
doc,"Wyatt, please, if you were ever My friend, if you ever had even The smallest feeling for me, Leave.  Leave now.  Please."
doc,"Never mind, Wyatt.  I know.  Just go."
doc,"Now let's see, Father.  What was That monkey show you were talking about?"
father feeney,You mean Extreme Unction?
doc,That's it.  Better start that ball rolling.
doc,I'll be damned...  This is funny.
josephine,"I know, it's-"
josephine,Wyatt!  My God...
wyatt,Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
wyatt,"I have nothing left.  I have Nothing to give you.  I have no Pride, no dignity, no money.  I Don't even know how we'll make a Living.  But I promise I'll love You every second of your life."
josephine,"Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich."
wyatt,There.  It'll come up over that ridge.
passenger,What's the commotion?  Who are they?
wyatt,"Get ready, here it comes!  Here it comes!"
