Speaker,Dialogue
troy,"Are we shooting people, or what?"
troy,That's what I'm asking you.
troy,I don't know the answer. That's what I'm trying to find out.
vig,Dag.
troy,"""Gettin' bugged drivin' up and down the same old strip, gotta find a new place where the kids are hip, I get around --"""
vig,It looked like the guy's head blew three feet into the air --
vig,"I said it looked like that happened, but then we got here and he was still breathing."
vig,"And when it hits the ground, his hand keeps on firing."
vig,Do you still want to sell pictures?
troy, For twenty.
troy,You're lucky you got to see anybody shot in this war.
vig,"War's been over five days, Jim, ain't gonna be much more of this."
vig,"Troy's enemy, yours for twenty."
troy,"Accept no substitute, this is the real thing, oh, Jesus [winces] --"
vig,What's wrong?
troy,I got a really bad headache all of a sudden--
vig,"No free pictures, motherfucker."
archie gates,Is that what you got from this experience? A goddamn watch?
havichon,Ees a great fucking watch.
archie gates,There's 700 million in gold out there and you're fucking around with a watch?
havichon,"Bon dieu de merde, that's a lot of gold, man."
archie gates,"One bunker of gold and we retire from this horseshit, Hashy--"
bill smithson,Gates.
archie gates,"Just a second. The problem, Hash, is how do you find it?"
havichon,Like one sowsan bunker out sair --
archie gates,"Maybe two sowsan bunker out sair, Hash, how do you find Saddam's bullion?"
bill smithson,"Could I have some help over here, for Chrissakes?"
archie gates,"My goodness, Bill, what seems to be the problem?"
bill smithson,I'm trying to do a story here and the fucking sand is blowing in my face --
archie gates,You want me to stop the sand? I can't do anything about that.
bill smithson,"No, you're too busy talking about the fucking gold, which by the way makes a great story if you'd get me a goddamn lead on it --"
archie gates,"I think the Saddam story goes more for the jugular, journalistically speaking, I mean, he's still here beating the shit out of his country."
bill smithson,Would you just be my guide and not my fucking producer? You're my guide.
archie gates,"OK, go do your celebration story, Bill."
bill smithson,You're heroes.
bill smithson,You've exorcised the ghosts of Vietnam with a clear moral imperative --
bill smithson,Where the hell are you going?
archie gates,I'll be right back.
bill smithson,"I don't want you helping other reporters, goddamn it."
bill smithson,Who's getting reemed? The Shiites?
chopper pilots,'--be livin' here today because the flag still stands for freedom and they can't take that awayyyyy --'
troy," And I'm proud I to be an American, where at least I know I'm free. And I won't forget the men who died, who gave that right to me. And I'd gladly stand up; next to you and defend her still today. Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land, God bless the U S A --"
troy,Rahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
vig,Rahhhhhhhhh.
troy,Rahhhhhhhhhhhhh.
troy,"It's cool, no one's gonna hurt you --"
vig,"Did you rape and torture anybody in Kuwait, Abdul?"
troy,You're making them all hysterical.
vig,"Take your fucking rags off, take this off. No comprende English, motherfucker?"
troy,"What is your fucking problem, Conrad?"
vig,I'm trying to git him to obey the spirit of things but he won't take his rags off.
troy," Sir? We need you to disrobe like all the other towel heads, OK?"
vig,"Whoa, it's a freaky thing, Troy."
troy,"There's a document in that guy's ass, Conrad."
vig,That's the freaky thing.
walter,Do you think he ate it?
troy,It wouldn't come out perfect like that if he ate it.
troy,"Go get it, Private."
iraqi officer,Hasa man timal!
troy,Open it up.
vig,You only gave me one glove.
troy,"I'm sorry I don't have another, but you gotta open it up. That's how the chain of command works."
vig,What the hell is that?
troy,Important enough to squeeze your cheeks for.
cathy daitch,"You are a trained warrior, trained warrior, trained warrior, Jesus Christ, Colonel!"
cathy daitch, What's Bill got?
archie gates,Just the celebration story.
cathy daitch,That's it?
archie gates,That's it --
archie gates,How about you? Did you find anything?
cathy daitch,It could be another bullshit lead but I need you to help me find a guy who might have something on the gold --
archie gates,Who's the guy?
cathy daitch,"Somebody Barlow, maybe in Company B--"
archie gates,Barlow.
cathy daitch,Got a map out of a prisoner's head.
archie gates,Out of a prisoner's head?
cathy daitch,"Or his ear, or his ass, or his dick, and they got like a fifty page full-color mini atlas of Saddam's bunkers --"
archie gates,Out of a guy's dick?
general pye,"This is not the way we service the media, Major. Stop her --"
mp,"You are in violation of code 37D, grinding Major Gates."
archie gates,You guys have no manners whatsoever --
bill smithson,I told you he was with her --
general pye,"We're handling this, OK?"
bill smithson,"I wanted help with the gold story, and he took off on me--"
archie gates,That's a lot of bullshit.
general pye,I give you a prestige job in the media war of the century and the guy feels neglected.
archie gates,I'm helping him plenty with his big celebration feature -- Where did you get this fucking star?
general horn,"They made me a general, pal."
archie gates,"For what? I don't even know what we did over here, but Schwartzkopf gets a book deal, you get a star, Powell gets to be fucking president--"
general horn,Are you high? This is a huge win for us.
archie gates,Running the press pool's a real big win for me.
general pye,You want us to kill more Americans to occupy Iraq?
archie gates,"I'm just saying it's ironic, that's all."
general horn,What the fuck is ironic?
archie gates,"We got the biggest army in the world here but Iraq still has the d-bag dictator in power, but that's how the world works I guess."
general pye,Just take care of Smithson and maybe he'll hook you up to consult on movies.
general horn,It's either that or be a security guard when you retire.
archie gates,"Fuck you, Ron."
general horn,"I'm a general now, you can't say fuck you to me."
archie gates,"OK, sir, but there's another thing I'd like to say, if you don't mind."
general horn,"Go right ahead, Colonel."
archie gates,"Fuuuuuck yooouuuu, Ronnnnn."
troy,"You've washed your hands like a thousand times, Conrad."
vig,Lord knows what vermin live in the butt of a dune koon.
doc,Why do you let this cracker follow you around?
troy,He's a good kid.
doc,He's a wall-eyed cracker.
troy,"He's got no high school, man, he's from a group home in Jackson --"
doc,I don't give a shit if he's from Johannesburg. I don't want to hear dune koon or sand nigger from him or anybody.
vig,Captain uses those terms.
troy,"The point is, Conrad, 'towel head' and 'camel jockey' are perfectly good substitutes."
doc,Exactly.
vig,"I'm sorry, man, it's a little confusing is all."
doc,What can I do for your headache?
troy,Got any Vicadan?
doc,All gone. How about Caffergot?
troy,Excellent. Let's translate my Iraqi ass map.
troy,Van Meter's at the big pow wow?
doc,"We're cool for at least three hours, but keep Walter on the door."
troy,Would you take those fucking things off?
walter,I never got to use night vision.
troy,They don't work during the day and stand outside the tent.
doc,These are definitely Saddam's bunkers near Karbala.
troy,What's inside?
doc,"According to Intelligence -- Picasso, Armani, Rolex, Mercedes, Sony you name it --  Kuwait was Muslim Beverly Hills and Saddam sacked it."
vig,"Man, get an awesome stereo system with like ten BOS speakers  --"
troy,Silver Lexus convertible.
doc,Lexus doesn't make a convertible.
troy,"Yes, they do."
doc,Infiniti has one coming.
troy,You're wrong.
doc,You can't get a car home from here anyway.
troy,If I get enough Rolexes I could buy one when I got home.
vig,"One gold Rolex, I get a very fine split level outside Jackson."
troy,"My one problem, see, is the risk here --"
doc,What risk? We already did the risk. I signed up last year to bank some computer training--
troy,Tell me about it.
doc,"Next thing I know I'm sitting here waiting to get hit by a Scud. I put my life on the line for what purpose I'm not sure, and now the good Lord puts this map in my path --"
troy,He could put a land mine in your path if we try to find this place --
doc,You're safe with me.
troy,Cuz you have a galactic plutonium forcefield.
doc,I don't talk about it. But I do have a ring of Jesus fire.
troy,You have a ring of Jesus fire.
doc,I was fire baptized.
vig,I was baptized in water.
doc,I'm fire baptized.
troy,I don't even know what water baptism means.
doc,"For those who understand, no explanation is necessary; for those who don't, no explanation will suffice. You can benefit from my Jesus ring if you do right by me, you got that?"
troy,OK.
walter,This tent is restricted --
archie gates,Get the fuck out of my way.
walter,"May day, may day --"
archie gates,Good afternoon.
archie gates,Would this be the proctology tent?
doc,"Yes, sir, I mean, no, sir."
archie gates,Then maybe it's the urology tent.
troy,Captain's at a staff meeting.
archie gates,"That's OK, I'm not looking for a proctologist or a urologist I'm looking for Sargeant Barlow."
archie gates,"You're on the path to truth when you smell shit, isn't that what they say?"
vig,"I don't recognize you, sir. Are you in this division?"
doc,He's not in this division. He's Special Forces.
doc,He's the guy taking Bill Smithson around.
archie gates,"And you would be the Three Wise Men, right, Mappy, Slappy, and Pappy --"
archie gates,That leaves Cappy outside.
walter,"Damn. Freeze. Do not pass. Hold it, freeze. Stop. Freeze."
vig,His name is Walter.
archie gates,Did you good soldiers present this map to Captain Van Meter?
troy,Not yet.
archie gates,Then I'll take it to him.
troy,We'll take it to him. Sir.
archie gates,"It won't do either of us any good then, will it?"
troy,"He's our commander, sir. We'd have to tell him you took it."
archie gates,It could be nothing but a sandy love letter from one Eye-raqi to another --
troy,It's a series of bunkers near Karbala.
archie gates,Maybe.
troy,"Not maybe, definitely. Recon photos match the map."
archie gates,May I look at the goddamn map?
vig,Dag.
archie gates,"That's what makes Rangers badass, we get the best flashlights."
archie gates,Still looks like a series of three bunkers in three villages. A bit farther to the west.
doc,Seventy-five klicks north.
troy,Much closer to Karbala.
archie gates,"Leave at dawn, back by lunch, not a big deal. Of course --"
archie gates,"-- there could be nothing inside but starving Arabs and stolen watches, but I think it's worth checking out, even if I have to do it with clueless reservists like you."
archie gates,"I mean, I could take the map, but you could talk, it starts to become a pain in the ass for me, so we'll do the gold together."
doc,What gold?
archie gates,"You don't even know what's inside these bunkers, do you?"
vig,Rolexes.
archie gates,"Rolexes are swell, but I'm talking about Kuwaiti bullion."
vig,You mean the little cubes you put in hot water for soup?
archie gates,No. Not the little cubes you put in hot water for soup.
troy,Gold bricks.
archie gates,"5 kilos each, $50,000 in today's market."
vig,For one gold brick?
archie gates,"I'm sure Mr. Hussein has divided his bricks. into many different hiding places, but just one hiding place should be easy to take, and that would be enough to get us out of our day jobs. Unless the three kings are in love with their day jobs."
vig,I don't really have a day job.
troy,What about the risk of taking a Humvee and all that --
archie gates,We do this shit all the time.
vig,"What else did you do, sir?"
archie gates,In Panama we went sailing in Noriega's boats.
troy,Wow.
archie gates,"In Vietnam, we got a big gold Buddha, which we unfortunately dropped in a swamp by accident."
doc,What about Iraqi soldiers?
archie gates,"Let's see. They had the shit bombed out them for two months, they're deserting all over the place, and they've completely surrendered to us. That's a beaten army in every sense of the word."
archie gates,"You are now under my command, salute --"
archie gates,What's the guy's name outside?
troy,Walter.
archie gates,Cappy.
archie gates,"You will take Bill Smithson on a special mission to find the gold story, but it will be a meaningless ride that lasts all morning and takes him nowhere near Karbala, is that clear?"
walter,How am I gonna get out of the company?
archie gates,Your captain will be detained by a friend of mine.
vig,Is it true you got to take an enemy ear to be Special Forces?
archie gates,"No, but if you talk to anybody about this, I'll kill you."
cathy daitch,Very dashing.
cathy daitch,Would you ever stand like that?
cathy daitch,You'll get used to it. First question: did you dream as a boy you'd be commanding an infantry company in a desert war?
doc,Pull.
doc,Pull.
troy,Pull.
troy,"I gave you a better arc, Doc."
doc,What are you talking about?
troy,I threw the ball in a higher arc that was easier for you to hit.
doc,Bullshit.
vig,Blacks make better receivers than quarterbacks.
troy,"Stop speaking right now, Conrad."
doc,Warren Moon is an excellent quarterback.
vig,The Oilers have gone nowhere behind Warren Moon.
doc,Randall Cunningham.
troy,"Don't get down in the mud with him, Doc."
vig,The Eagles will never get to the Superbowl with him.
doc,"Doug Williams took the Redskins to the Superbowl and won, OK?"
troy,We can all agree there are many excellent black quarterbacks.
doc,"Hit it, you sorry-assed cracker --"
vig,This gun's too heavy to shoot one-handed like a movie star --
archie gates,Shut the fuck up.
archie gates,"When we pull up to the bunker, the approach is something called violence of action, which is standard in special operations. It means your movement is so fast and decisive that the guards are frozen and we haven't fired a single shot."
troy,Shit.
archie gates,We dropped a lot of bombs out here and we buried some guys alive --
vig,What do you mean?
archie gates,Bradleys with big plows cut through the berms and covered the trenches --
archie gates,Let's rehearse.
archie gates,"We'll say the cow is the primary guard outside the bunker. We pull up fast, and stop short."
troy,Got it.
archie gates,And -- Go.
archie gates,Who's hurt?
doc,"It's all cow, I think."
vig,"Yeah, it's all cow."
doc,They said this was swept for mines.
archie gates,"Mines are forever, Doc. They never get all of 'em."
troy," 'If you could, help me Rhonda, help help me Rhonda --'"
archie gates,Did you guys see any action at all?
vig,"Only night bombing on CNN, except for Troy's supercool shooting that guy in the neck--"
archie gates,Is sepsis cool?
vig,What's sepsis?
doc,Infection of the blood.
archie gates,"As in septic tank, because that's what happens when a bullet hits you. The lead tears in there --"
archie gates,"But other than a wound that blinds, paralyzes, or castrates, the worst wound I've ever seen is something called tension pneumo thorax --"
doc,I heard something about that --
vig,Tension pneumo what?
archie gates,"A bullet, or a blade doesn't kill you, but makes a little hole in the lung, so every time you breathe, a little air leaks into the chest cavity, which starts to fill up like a balloon. And that balloon starts to push your organs to the side, crushing your lung, your liver, your heart. Your own breathing kills you, one breath at a time -- kinda like a job you can't stand or a bad lie you once told."
doc,"That's not fatal, they can stop it."
archie gates,"If you know how to make another little hole in the chest to let the air out, just like you would with an overinflated tire."
troy,Can we play the Beach Boys when we go in?
doc,The goddamn Beach Boys.
troy,I'm not ashamed of liking the Beach Boys. It calms me down. Better than Mozart.
archie gates,Bach.
vig,Where's the bunker?
archie gates,It should be right --
archie gates,There.
archie gates,No -- there.
vig,We are the Army of the United States of America. We are here to protect you. Remain calm.
archie gates,"Orders from President Bush, step aside."
iraqi mother,No milk. Baby milk.
archie gates,Do not panic.  Step outside --
vig, We are here for your protection and safety.
vig,"Ya'll be cool now, this is the U.S. Marines in charge here."
troy,Shit.
troy,Freeze.
friendly iraqi,I am love United States of Freedom. I am hate Saddam.
troy,Ya -- ya -- ha --
doc,Let him go.
friendly iraqi,"No problem, my friend."
friendly iraqi,You look for the chemical weapon?
troy,No. We look for the gold.
archie gates,Where's the gold?
friendly iraqi,They move the gold.
doc,Kill him.
archie gates,Not yet.
troy,Kill him now.
archie gates,Where?
friendly iraqi, This bunker. I'll take you.
child,Ma-Maa.
archie gates,Move. Out of the way.
shiite woman,Hos-pital.
shiite man,America help.
archie gates,Give them MRE's.
bill smithson,"This is boring, I already did this damn story, goddamn it, where the hell is the gold?"
walter,How about rare pelican migration out by the marshes?
bill smithson,What?
walter,These brave pelicans are migrating in spite of massive pollution --
bill smithson,Fuck that. Stop the bike.
doc,"I'm all right, I'm cool."
archie gates,"What is the art of war, because it is not for killing people, it's a stratagem to give life to many by killing the evil perpetrated by a few -- I am burning up in this goddamn suit --"
archie gates,"Discriminating use of violence as a last resort, and even then, carefully, surgically, that's what I learned, that's what I'm good at. But now they underestimate all this, bomb the same towns for six weeks  and still leave the scumbag dictator to starve and butcher his own people."
troy, I don't even know what happened back there. Civilians were spitting on their own soldiers; the soldiers were shooting the civilians and ignoring us --
doc,They already surrendered to us. Now they're after Shiites.
vig,What exactly is a Shiite?
archie gates,"They make up the ethnic majority but they don't have any power. When Bush pulled us out, he told them to start a civil war to bring Saddam down, and now they're getting wasted."
vig, The civil war? How could it be the civil war?
troy,"It's a war inside the same country, Conrad. That's a civil war."
archie gates,"Put these on, we are now U.S. Marines."
troy,"I can't do this, OK? Because I've got a family and if I shit in a bag the rest of my life cuz I got shot after the war's already over that would be pretty fucking stupid, wouldn't it?"
archie gates,What is the most important thing in life?
troy,What the fuck are you talking about?
archie gates,What is it?
troy,Did you hear anything I said.
vig,Respect is the most important.
archie gates,Too dependent on other people.
doc,Money.
archie gates,"Comes and goes, man."
troy,What is this bullshit?
doc,What's the most important thing?
archie gates,"Necessity. That's what dictates what will happen at any given time in life. Necessity says we don't spend American lives taking out Saddam,  which leaves Saddam the necessity of taking out the Shiites so he can stay in power, which leaves us to take the gold."
troy,We could've been shot.
archie gates,Did you notice they didn't touch us?  We decimated their entire country. They're scared shitless of us. [looks at his watch] There's time to try another bunker. I say we go.
doc,Let's do it.
vig,Rock and roll.
troy,OK. And I'll be wearing fashionable kevlar. As a necessity.
bill smithson," I'm at some goddamn marsh, all we've seen are Russian cranes."
walter,Pelicans.
bill smithson," I think the Saddam story goes more for the jugular, journalistically speaking, Al. Let's grow some balls and do the Shiite uprising, for Christ's sake."
bill smithson,We're going north to do the Shiites.
walter,I thought the gold was the hot spot.
bill smithson,"Karbala's the new hotspot, and I'm driving."
walter,"Military regulations, you cannot drive."
walter,"Get off the vehicle, sir."
walter,"Don't make me shoot you, sir."
general horn,What the fuck are you doing?
general horn,Do you have authorization?
general horn,No.
general horn,Who gave you this?
general horn,"Archie Gates gave you this? Jesus Christ, Doug, come with me."
general horn,"No, you don't get to do the interview."
archie gates,Faster.
archie gates, United States Marine Corps. Put your weapons down.
troy,Drop your weapon.
doc,Put it down.
vig,"Don't make me smoke your ass, Abdul."
troy,Freeze.
archie gates,"By order of the cease-fire signed in Safwan, March 3, the United States Marines hereby confiscate all material stolen by Iraq from the Emirate of Kuwait --"
troy,Down.
archie gates,"Never hit anyone with your pistol, Doc."
doc,Sorry about that.
iraqi captain,For wife.
archie gates,I've been divorced three times.
troy,"No, newest and best has better noise reduction."
troy,"Less distortion. Get down on the floor, OK?"
troy,"This is bad music, understand? It's bad for you."
archie gates," Where's the gold, Captain? Tell us so we don't have to kill you."
troy,There's another room over here.
iraqi sargeant,"I am just do my job, buddy."
interrogator,These Shiite. Iraq problem. United States is out now.
interrogator,"We take them outside, so it don't bother you, OK, sir? Kata fanam."
archie gates,Take us to the basement.
vig,Don't start this shit again.
vig,"I know ya'll Shiite gettin' yer asses whipped --  Hey, what the hell is going on here?"
vig,"Git on the fucking ground, Arab."
iraqi sargeant,Prisoner stay. Gabar matan.
vig,What the fuck are you talking about?
iraqi sargeant,Kinam vanir! Vanir!
vig,Goddamn it everybody calm down.
iraqi captain,"It's my ass, donkey dick, Saddam will shoot me dead."
interrogator,Saddam worries more about the Shiite than the gold.
vig, This is the United States Military.
iraqi captain,It's Saddam's gold.
interrogator,"Shut up, he signed the treaty."
archie gates,"Listen to me: we leave you alone to kill your Shiites, but everything you took from Kuwait, that belongs to us now, understand?"
archie gates,Put it back.
doc,Why?
archie gates,Stick to the plan. The plan is for gold.
troy,Is this five kilos?
archie gates,"Yeah, that's five kilos."
troy,"Five, six, seven, eight, there's sixty bricks in this suitcase."
doc,Times 50K each --
troy,Three million dollars.
archie gates,Ten suitcases; sixty bricks each. That's thirty million dollars.
troy,I'm gonna get a fleet of Lexus convertibles in different colors.
doc,I told you Lexus doesn't make a convertible.
troy,I'll bet you a Lexus they do.
doc,"OK, you're on for a Lexus, but it won't be a convertible."
troy,Shit.
archie gates,They didn't get it here in these bags.
doc,The tensilary strength goes to 200 pounds.
troy,The what?
doc,"Tensilary strength, it's what the suitcase can hold."
archie gates,Why would you know that?
troy,He works at an airport.
doc,"60 bars, 13 pounds each is like -- 800 pounds. The smaller Vuittons"
archie gates,You got any more luggage here?
archie gates,"It's crazy to take it all, we're not prepared for it. It's crazy not to take it all, how can we leave it?"
troy,What's the shipping plan?
archie gates,I told you that's handled.
troy,How is it handled? You have to tell us now.
doc,"Yeah, tell us now."
archie gates," I've got a friend, he's in French Special Forces. He's gonna put it in barrels filled with oil and bury it. In a few weeks, he'll drive it to Yanbu --"
troy,Where's Yanbu?
archie gates,It's a port in Saudi.
troy,"I don't know about getting them to Baltimore, but these hat boxes ain't gonna fit in the Humvee."
archie gates,We need a trailer.
troy,"OK, I'll call U-Haul in Karbala to see what they have on the lot today."
archie gates,"See what you can get, Barlow."
troy,"Conrad, we need a trailer --"
vig,"Did you get it? Troy, did you get it?"
troy,"Yeah, we got it."
vig,Is it a lot?
troy,"Yeah, it's a lot."
troy," 'Little deuce coupe with a fiat head mill, she'll walk a Thunderbird like it's standin' still --'"
troy,'She'll do a hundred and forty with the top end floored --'
troy,'She's my little deuce coupe --'
iraqi major,"You take the Kuwaiti gold, yes?"
archie gates,We take the Kuwaiti gold. Yes.
iraqi major,Saddam cannot keep.
archie gates,"No, Saddam cannot keep."
iraqi major,Saddam have too many problem today.
archie gates,He certainly does.
iraqi major,You need help to load?
archie gates,We can do it ourselves.
iraqi major,Hazal jarat finan.
iraqi major,These man help you.
interrogator,You go away fast from this bullshit.
archie gates,Let's load up and get out of here.
troy,"Lay that one flat; OK, sideways --"
archie gates,This isn't gonna work.
troy,Sure it is --
iraqi major,You need a truck.
archie gates,We'll rig two carts.
troy,Let's take the truck.
archie gates,We're not taking their truck.
troy,Why not?
iraqi major,We cooperate with peace accord. Please take truck.
troy,Let's take the truck.
iraqi major,Nazaran yafit haisul.
archie gates,This has to stop.
interrogator,"You get your ass kick in a war, it feel good to be strong again."
archie gates,What did you say?
iraqi major,"You go now, please."
archie gates,"I don't think so. I'm sure you know about the Geneva Convention, right?"
interrogator,"Geneva convention? You bomb my house, man."
iraqi major,That Shiite man is leader of uprising. He kill my man.
troy,"Archie, let's stick to the plan, sir. The plan is for gold, right?"
doc,"We can help them first, then be on our way."
troy,"No, we can't. It's not what we're here for."
archie gates,How much?
iraqi major,What?
archie gates,How much gold do you want to let these people come with us?
interrogator,Cannot do.
archie gates,"What do you mean, cannot do? I'm offering you a lot of money."
iraqi major,Cannot let Shiite go --
interrogator,Saddam kill us.
iraqi major,"Saddam kill to me if we let them go, OK? Now you go."
archie gates,Cover me.
troy,"Jesus Christ, we can't save everybody."
archie gates,Are you listening? I said cover me.
archie gates,"No unnecessary shots, Conrad, is that clear?"
vig,"Yes, sir."
archie gates,"Because we know what bullets do to vital organs, don't we?"
vig,"Make infected pockets filled with bile, sir."
archie gates,"That's right, that's what they do."
iraqi major, U.S.A. is out of Shiite war.
archie gates,No shooting.
troy,What's happening?
archie gates,Accident. Stay cool.
troy,No.
archie gates,Cover these three.
archie gates,Doc.
doc,Down.
iraqi soldier,Kazal stan hamir in fatar.
archie gates,Put the Shiites in the Humvee.
troy,There's no room.
archie gates,Make room.
troy,What the fuck happened to necessity?
archie gates,It just changed.
troy,Not for me.
archie gates,"Obey the fucking order, Barlow."
troy,This is fucked up.
doc,What if that was you?

vig,"Maybe we got kicked out of the ring of Jesus fire, on account of stealing."
doc,That's not how it works.
vig,How does it work?
doc,I take care of what Jesus puts in front of me. That's what we did with the gold.

archie gates,It was my choice today. So you can head back if you want. I'll find Barlow myself.
doc,What about the gold?
archie gates,Take what you can carry. Try to find a vehicle. Bury what you have outside camp. Be careful about it.
vig,I want to find Troy.

archie gates,We'll walk until we find some.
archie gates,With what? We don't have a radio.
archie gates,We can't do that.

archie gates,You're wrong.
archie gates,We need to find our man. How much do you want to take us there?

vig,"Give me a fucking break, man."
doc,We saved your life.
imam,And we saved yours.
archie gates,We lost a man for you.
imam,"What good is it if you leave us to get wasted? The big army of democracy beats the ugly dictator, saves the rich Kuwaitis, but you go to jail if you help us escape the same dictator.  You saw what happened to my wife. Look at my daughter."
archie gates,Who's going?
imam,Everyone but the priests. That's
vig,Fuck it. We'll find this place on our own.
imam,It's not on a map. You can look.

troy,Right.
troy,So why are you doing this to me?
interrogator,"It's my job, man, for Saddam, just like your job when you bomb my house."
troy,"It's not just a job, it still matters what you do."
interrogator,Bullshit. It's all a job.
troy,"It still matters what you do, what you're doing right now matters."
interrogator,Bullshit.
troy,"The art of war is not for killing people, it's a stratagem to give life to many with minimum violence, minimum --"
interrogator,Then why you bomb my fahking house and kill my son? Can you think how it feels inside your heart if I bomb your daughter?
troy,Worse than death --
interrogator,It feels like this --
troy,Don't --
interrogator,"Everyday, inside my heart --"
interrogator,"Like this, like this, like this --"
archie gates,Did we save anything from the Humvee?
doc,This bag.
vig,You got the same name as the tall model who does David Bowie.
doc,"That's Im-an, with an 'n.' He's Imam with an 'm.'"
vig,That's the same name.
doc,It's not the same name.
vig,Whatever. They're both attractive names.
archie gates,This is the United States Army. Come out of the truck with your weapons in the air.
vig,Shit. Sorry.
archie gates,They used a lot of decoys to throw off our bombers.
doc,Where are we gonna get a vehicle?
imam,I know a place that's full of deserters. Maybe they got something.
shiite,America!
shiite,Freedom! Thank you to America!
archie gates,We don't have any food.
doc,Where'd you get these animals from?
imam, Kishan tramai jahal?
imam,"This is for you, my friend, to eat if you are hungry."
archie gates,"No, thank you."
imam,"They're not barbarians, they're starving."
doc,"I'm getting really dizzy, man."
archie gates,We need water.
archie gates,Radio?
friendly iraqi,No radio.
archie gates,"No radio, no water, but yes CNN."
archie gates,Not exactly.
archie gates,Would you explain to these gentlemen that we need a vehicle of some kind?
doc,Could I ask a question?
doc,Does Lexus make this model?
doc,Exactly what I said.
archie gates,Listen. We use these cars to go fight Saddam soldiers.
doc,What's so funny?
doc,"What do you mean, cannot take? We kicked Saddam's ass. We definitely take."
archie gates,We are the United States military.
imam,You're three guys with a bunch of Shiites and no Humvee.
imam,"He says the Americans have many tanks, many airplanes. We have nothing."
archie gates,We will rise up together.
imam,Jihala vamat.
archie gates,Rise up together.
archie gates,"Look at us. Working together. Many races, many nations. Tell him, Doc."
doc,We are united.

doc,"Jahal yaqat, brothers."
archie gates,"God bless America, and God bless a free Iraq."
archie gates,"What do you say now, my friend?"
friendly iraqi,Cannot give car.
archie gates,Then I guess we'll have to buy them.
vig,"Judas Priest will pump you, Doc --"
doc,I already had it with the Beach Boys today.
vig,One song.
archie gates,"We get our man, we come back to pick up the gold --"
imam,And my people.
archie gates,"My gold isn't here, and I mean all of it, your people will not survive."
imam,I understand.
archie gates,OK. Let's load and go.
vig,"Wait a second, I want to talk about this plan some more --"
archie gates,"We're going to drive in and get Troy, exactly like we discussed."
vig,I have a bad feeling like we're gonna get wasted.
archie gates,You're scared. It's good to be scared when there's guns around.
doc,I'm cool. I'm all right.
troy,Your son wouldn't be dead if Saddam didn't invade Kuwait.
troy,Who's got the sick country?
interrogator,"Maybe Saddam is very crazy, right? And then you are crazy to bomb all of Iraq."
troy,"Too much bombing is crazy, but not saving Kuwait."
interrogator,You come here to save Kuwait people?
troy,Yes.
interrogator,Really?  Jahaza fan.
interrogator,"Lots of people in trouble around this world, my man. You don't fight no fahking war for them."
troy,You invaded another country. You can't do that.
interrogator,"Why not, dude?"
troy,It makes the world crazy. You got to keep it stable.
interrogator,For what? Your pick up truck?
troy,"No, for stability. Stabilize the region."
interrogator,"This is your fahking stability, my main man."
vig,Splinter.
shiite,Come on.
vig,"Go straight, go straight --"
interrogator,Are you feeling stable enough for more?
doc,"Stop shooting, what's the matter with you?"
vig,Shit.
vig,"Jesus God, I don't wanna get hit, please Jesus, watch over me --"
interrogator,"It's OK, buddy, we are just talking now --"
archie gates,Let's go.
archie gates,Come on.
vig,"You gotta be my disguise, Mr. Shiite, cuz they need my help over there --"
tough iraqi,Let's go back and get them.
tough iraqi,"There's a chopper, we can do it."
tough iraqi,"They killed your families, you fucking cowards."
archie gates,"We're gonna get out of here alive, just do what I say, do you hear me?"
archie gates,"Step, throw, one-two -- I'm gonna give it a five second fuse. That gives you two steps out the door."
archie gates,Wait --
vig,God help me.
archie gates,Go.
archie gates,OK.  Shorter fuse this time.
archie gates,We're not done. Check every Iraqi here.
troy, Where's Conrad?
archie gates,Don't let your guard down.
archie gates,"Stay there, don't move."
imam,Jakar yizam ut naral --

archie gates,He helped us find you.
troy,All right. You're all right.
troy,How's your girl?
imam,She's safe. For the moment.
troy,All right. Excellent. How can we help?
doc,"Calm down, man."
troy,I'm calm. Don't I look calm?
imam,"We had a deal to get us to the border, but we need more vehicles for these people."
troy,We're gonna work it out. We can do it. We have to work it out.
doc,I'm not sure how. This is a lot of people.
troy,"OK, you choose who we take. You tell the others it's not convenient, they'll have to die."
doc,"Take it easy, man."
troy,"You think I don't know what I'm saying. I know what I'm saying. We're gonna do more than steal, that's what I'm saying. We're gonna help these people out."
imam,This guy was worth saving.
archie gates,He's a soldier.

archie gates,Lock it down. Shoot anything that moves.
imam, Haza janav yasat.
vig,"You made it, man --"
troy,Help him.
vig,"What happened to the Jesus fire, Doc?"
doc,"It's around you right now, man, it works on this side or the other side."
vig,You never told me that part. I guess I could go to one of them shrines that erase the bad you did --
troy,"We made the right choice today, Conrad."
vig,"We did good, right?"
troy,We made the right choice.
doc,"Dear Lord watch over this man, help him if you can. Our father who art in heaven --"
troy,Help.
doc,"-- hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done --"
archie gates,Goddamn it.
vig,Do you still want to sell pictures?
troy, For twenty.
vig,"War's been over five days, ain't gonna be any more of this, Jim."
troy,You're lucky you got to see anybody shot in this war.
vig,"It's Troy's enemy, yours for twenty."
archie gates,I've been waiting 18 years to get that right.
troy,He's got no family.
archie gates,We're his family now.
doc,He wanted to go to one of those shrines.
imam,Kajatar in Iran. We can take him.
archie gates,Good. Take him.
archie gates,"Air pressure will build up about every fifteen minutes. Release the valve, close it up again."
troy,How long can I keep doing this?
archie gates,"Maybe four hours, if you're not bleeding too bad inside."
troy,I'm really thirsty.
doc,There's no water anywhere.
imam, I got you hooked up if you want to call your man.
archie gates," Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, do you read me?"
doc,We're gonna be court-martialed.
archie gates,"No, we're not."
archie gates," Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, are you reading this?"
walter," This is Tar Baby, come in."
walter, About two clicks outside camp.
walter, Right.
walter,I think so -- who handles the briar patch?
walter,"Oh, OK, and the Tar Baby goes to the briar patch if everything's OK, right?"
walter,"Shit, I'm sorry, sir, I don't remember how the code goes --"
archie gates,Six personnel trucks and a Humvee.
walter,"Wow. That's a tall order for a secret operation, sir."
archie gates,Talk to my friend Hash. Each driver will get 100K.
walter,Did you say 100K?
archie gates,"Roger. Brer Rabbit at 239 North. Add one medavac pack to the order, and dump the reporter."
walter,Roger. Give me two hours.
general horn,Narrow it down to what sounds like Archie Gates and a Humvee.
general horn,"I want a direction, we're not gonna comb the whole goddamn desert --"
private,"This is from Barlow's C.O. at Fort Bragg, something with his wife."

havichon,Iranian border?
archie gates,Part of the deal.
havichon,"C'est super, Archie, you got yourself a pain in the ass mission of mercy."
walter,"Sorry I fucked up the code, sir."
archie gates,It means we gotta move. They might be coming for us.
havichon,What are you seenking?
archie gates,I see an opening we can walk through. But it's not wide enough for a truck.
archie gates,We'll walk them to the border. The Iranians will take them. We'll walk back to the trucks and get out of here.
archie gates,Make a close group.
imam, Jihad yamat -- yamat.
doc,Let the air out.
troy,"It's not the air, I don't know what it is --"
doc,Stay back.
troy,I'm all right. I'm just dizzy or something --
archie gates,Double time.

archie gates,Let them get over the border.
troy,"Let them get over, wait --"
troy,I have to reach this --
archie gates,Put his cuffs in front.
troy,Look what's happening.
troy,Cut my cuffs --
doc,He's gonna die.
archie gates,"Goddamn it, Ron, give him medical attention, don't let him die --"
general horn,"We are not involved in the Shiite problem, do you understand me? You are AWOL, you are a fugitive, you are under arrest."
archie gates,Cut his cuffs.
archie gates,We got the gold.

archie gates,"They helped us get it, Ron. I made a deal, and that's soldier's honor. You can't fuck them now."
archie gates,"You can return this gold, be a big hero, get another star maybe."
general horn,"Let's go, Doug."
general horn,Who's in charge here?
general horn,We have to talk about this situation.
bill smithson,In a morbid tableau these men have recovered some of the gold bullion stolen from Kuwait --
cathy daitch,"--in violation of American policy, saved over a hundred Shiite refugees while recovering stolen Kuwaiti gold --"
general horn,Turn that damn camera off.
bill smithson,That's a 75 thousand dollar camera --
general horn,What the fuck are they doing here?
sargeant,I thought they were authorized --
general horn,"They are not fucking authorized, for Christ's sake --"
general horn,"Haven't I taken care of you, dammit?"
cathy daitch,I'm gonna get that tape back.
general horn,You are under arrest. You are going to be court-martialed. And you will show us where the bullion is right now.
