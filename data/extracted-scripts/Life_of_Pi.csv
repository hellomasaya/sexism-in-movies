Speaker,Dialogue
adult pi,The way of karma; the way of God.
writer,I assumed your father was a mathematician - because of your name.
adult pi,"Oh, far from it. I was named after a swimming pool."
writer,There's a swimming pool named 'Pi?'
adult pi," You see, my uncle, Francis, was born with too much water in his lungs. They say the doctor swung Francis around by the ankles to clear the water out and that's what gave him the huge chest and skinny legs that made him such a great swimmer."
writer, Is Francis actually your uncle? He said he was friends with your father.
pi,"I call him 'Mamaji,' my 'honorary uncle' - my father's best friend, my swimming guru."
mamaji,A mouthful of water will not harm you - but panic will.
adult pi, I hope you don't mind vegetarian.
writer,"No, not at all... And your name?"
adult pi,Hmm?
writer,"You - you were going to tell me how you got your name, I think."
adult pi,I got it from something Mamaji once told my father. Most travelers collect postcards or teacups on their journeys - but not Mamaji. Mamaji collects swimming pools. 
adult pi,"... but he did, and I was named ""Piscine Molitor Patel."""
another boy,Look at him he's Pissing!
science teacher,So then - what might occur if we release gas too quickly? Pissing?
boy,He said Pissing!
science teacher,That's enough - order!
boy,Present sir.
history teacher,Piscine Patel...
history teacher,"Very impressive, Pi. Now sit down."
librarian,"Slowly, Slowly! Slowly, Slowly!"
librarian,It is right... He's really doing this!
all,1! 4! 9! 3! 1! PI! PI! PI!
writer,"Mamaji tells me you're a legend among sailors, too. Out there all alone -"
adult pi,I don't even know how to sail. And I wasn't alone out there. Richard Parker was with me.
writer,Richard Parker...? Mamaji didn't tell me everything. He just said I should look you up when I got back to Montreal.
adult pi,So what were you doing in Pondicherry?
writer,Writing a novel.
adult pi,"By the way, I enjoyed your first book. The new one, is it set in India?"
writer,"No, Portugal, actually. But it's cheaper living in India."
adult pi,"Ah. Well, I look forward to reading it."
writer,"You can't. I threw it out. Two years trying to bring it to life, and then one day it sputtered, coughed, and died."
adult pi,I'm sorry.
writer," I was in a coffee house in Pondicherry one afternoon, mourning my loss, when this old man at the next table struck up a conversation."
adult pi,"Yeah, Mamaji. He does that."
writer,"When I told him about my abandoned book, he said:  ""So... a Canadian who's come to French India in search of a story. Well, my friend, I know an Indian in French Canada who has the most incredible story to tell. It must be fate that the two of you should meet."""
adult pi,I haven't spoken about Richard Parker in so many years... What has Mamaji already told you?
writer,He said you had a story that would make me believe in God.
adult pi," He would say that about a nice meal. As for God, I can only tell you my story; you will decide for yourself what you believe."
writer,Fair enough.
adult pi,"Let's see, then - where to begin?"
adult pi,"When the French handed Pondicherry back to us in 1954, the town decided that some sort of commemoration was in order."
writer,"It sounds magical, growing up in-"
adult pi,Amen. Let's eat.
writer,I didn't know Hindus said 'amen.'
adult pi, Catholic Hindus do.
writer,Catholic Hindus?
adult pi,We get to feel guilty before hundreds of gods instead of just one.
writer,But you're a Hindu first?
pi,None of us knows God    until someone introduces us. I was    first introduced to God as    a Hindu. There are 330 million gods    in the Hindu religion - how can I    not come to know a few of them?
pi,...But he didn't!
mother,"That's what he told her. ""I didn't eat dirt!"" ""No? Well, then open your mouth."" So Krishna opened his mouth."
father," Spectacle. Don't let the stories and pretty lights fool you, boys. Religion is darkness."
priest,"You must be thirsty. Here, I brought you this."
pi,Why would a god do that? Why would he send his own son to suffer for the sins of ordinary people?
priest,Because He loves us. God made Himself approachable to us - human - so we could understand Him. 
adult pi,That made no sense. Sacrificing the innocent to atone for the sins of the guilty? What kind of love is that?
pi,"If God is so perfect and we're not, why would He want to create all this? Why does He need us at all?"
priest,"All you have to know is that He loves us. ""God so loved the world that He gave His only Son."" This Son taught us to love one another..."
pi,"Thank you, Vishnu, for introducing me to Christ.  ADULT PI  I came to faith through Hinduism and I found God's love through Christ, but God wasn't finished with me yet."
father,This lamb is exquisite - it's best dish on the table. You are all missing out...
ravi," Are you going to Mecca this year, Swami Jesus? Or to Rome, for your coronation as Pope Pi-us?"
mother,"You stay out of this, Ravi. Just as you like cricket, Pi has his own interests."
father,"No Gita, Ravi has a point, no? You cannot follow three different religions at the same time, Piscine."
pi,Why not?
father,Because believing in everything at the same time is the same as not believing in anything at all.
mother,He's young Santosh - he's still finding his way.
father,"And how can he find his way if he does not choose a path?  Listen: instead of leaping from one religion to the next, why not start with reason? In a few hundred years, science has taken us farther in understanding the universe than religion has in ten thousand."
mother,"That is true. Your father is right. Science can teach us more about what's out there -  - but not what is in here. Art, music, literature - they all spring from our faith."
father,"Some eat meat, some eat vegetable. I do not expect us all to agree about everything. But I would much rather have you believe in something I don't agree with than to accept everything blindly. And that begins with thinking rationally. Do you understand?"
pi,I would like to be baptized.
writer,So you're a Christian and a Muslim?
adult pi,"And a Hindu, of course."
writer,"And a Jew, I suppose?"
adult pi,"Oh, well, I do teach a course on the Kabbalah at the University. And why not? Faith is a house with many rooms."
writer,But no room for doubt?
adult pi,"Plenty. On every floor. Doubt is useful. It keeps faith a living thing. After all, you can't know the strength of your faith until it's been tested."
ravi,Where's Selvam? We shouldn't be in here without him.
pi,Stop worrying. I have seen him do this a thousand times. I want to meet our new tiger.
ravi,Pi!...
pi,Hello! Richard Parker!
writer,A tiger? Richard Parker was a tiger?
adult pi,"He got his name through a clerical error. A hunter caught him drinking from a stream when he was a cub and named him Thirsty. When Thirsty got too big, the hunter sold him to our zoo - but the names got switched on the paperwork. The hunter was listed as Thirsty and tiger was called Richard Parker. We laughed about it and the name stuck."
ravi,Let's go. Before we get into trouble.
pi,I want to see him close up.
ravi,You're not a zoo keeper. Come on!
pi," That's it, Richard Parker. It's for you."
father,No!!!
pi,I just wanted to say 'Hello' to him.
father,"You think that tiger is your friend. He is an animal, not a playmate!"
pi,Animals have souls. I've seen it in their eyes.
father,Find Selvam!
selvam," You're sure, Mr. Patel? Pi's just a kid."
father, Do it. Go ahead.
ravi, Don't be stupid! Say you're sorry.
mother,"What have you done, Piscine? You know what your father said about coming back here."
pi,I'm sorry. I was...
mother,What are you thinking?
father,"This is between a father and his sons.  Selvam, the gate."
mother,He said he's sorry. You want to scar them for life?
father,Scar them? That boy almost lost his arm!
mother,But he's still a boy!
father,"He will be a man sooner than you think, and this is a lesson I do not want them ever to forget.  Selvam."
dance master,"No. If you do not concentrate, you cannot express your love of God through dance. Feel the ground beneath your feet; "
anandi,Why are you following me?
pi,What?
anandi,You were following me.
pi, What does this mean?
anandi,No - that also means the lotus flower.
pi,The lotus flower is hiding in the forest? Why would a lotus flower hide in the forest?
pi,And this is Richard Parker. He's the most magnificent creature we've ever had here.  Look at the way he's turning his head. Showing off - like a dancer.
anandi,"No, he heard something - he's listening. You see?"
father,So...you see? We have talked about it for some time... Do you understand what I'm saying? Pi?
pi,Sorry. You've been...
father,"Worried. For my family. Our animals are worth far more abroad than here in India, and if the town council stops supporting us, I don't know where we'll be. So... it is what we have to do. Do you understand?"
pi,I'm sorry... what are we talking about?
ravi,We are leaving India.
pi,What??
mother,We are selling the zoo.
father,"The zoo itself was never ours to sell - the land belongs to the town. But the animals are ours, and if we sell them, we will have enough to start a new life."
pi,But where would we go? Our life is here Appa!
father,"Canada. I have some opportunities for work in Winnipeg. I'll be shipping most of the animals for sale in North America; we can get freighter passage for the whole family. So, it is settled. We will sail like Columbus!"
pi,But Columbus was looking for India!
mother,"Pi, they're serving dinner below. "
mother,My sons and I are vegetarians. Do you have anything - ?
french cook, You don't want gravy?
mother," No, I want something vegetarian. I-"
french cook,There. No problems.
father,She asked if you have something vegetarian.
french cook,"Vegetarian - the cow that produced this liver was vegetarian, the pigs that went into these sausages were vegetarian."
father,Very funny. But she doesn't eat liver.
french cook, Or you can go cook your own food.
father,How dare you talk to my wife like that?
french cook,"Here's your rice. I cook for sailors, not curry eaters."
father,What did you call us??
french cook,Let go of me!
father,Who do you think you are? You're nothing but a servant!
french cook,I feed people! You feed monkeys!
father,I'll teach you respect!
a short time,LATER -
taiwanese sailor,"Hello, I am happy Buddhist, so I eat rice next to gravy. On ship, gravy is not meat. Is taste. Okay? You try?"
father, Don't worry - we will have plenty of fresh supplies after we stop in Manila.
pi,Why give O.J. a tranquilizer? She's not going to cause any trouble.
father,The stress of traveling is not good for the animals. 
writer,... So...
adult pi,Have I forgotten anything?
writer,I think you've set the stage. So far we have an Indian boy named after a French swimming pool on a Japanese ship full of animals heading to Canada.
adult pi,"Yes. Now we have to send our boy into the middle of the Pacific, and -"
writer,And make me believe in God.
adult pi,Yes. We'll get there.
pi,Ravi? Did you hear that?  Ravi?
ravi,... I'm sleeping.
pi,It's a thunderstorm! Let's go watch!
ravi,Are you crazy? We'll get hit by lightning.
pi,"No, we won't. It'll hit the bridge first."
ravi,"Don't tempt a storm, Pi.  On the other side of the narrow room, Mother shifts uncomfortably on the double bed she shares with Father."
pi,"More rain, lord of storms! Let it rage!"
pi,"AMMA! APPA! RAVI! GET OUT, GET OUT!"
pi,HELP!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!
japanese captain,Don't scare. Okay? Wait stay here.
pi,"You have to help them, please! Oh no my family, please. You have to help them, my family is back there."
japanese captain,We don't have time.
taiwanese sailor,We help. You must go.
pi,Who let all the animals out?
pi,No wait! My father - he can't swim -
japanese captain,This is your last chance--just go!
pi,No please!
french cook,Loosen the lines! Bring it down!
french cook, Jump! Jump!
pi,"HELP! HELP! SOMEBODY, HELP ME!"
pi,Amma! Appa! Ravi! I'm sorry! I'm sorry...!
pi,Hari?
pi,HELLO...! HELLO...! ANYBODY?
pi,No! Stop it! Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop it! NO!!! NO!!! NO!!!
pi,"I'm sorry, O.J.; I don't have any seasickness medicine for you -"
pi,YES!
pi,There are no lines!
pi,"Here, Richard Parker. I've got some water for you."
pi,Patience!
pi,What am I doing?
pi,"I'm sorry.     I'm sorry.  Pi is devastated. He weeps, bringing his hands together, pressing them against his forehead, murmuring a prayer to himself and bowing over the dead fish in abject grief.  PI  Thank you, Lord Vishnu. Thank you for coming in the form of a fish and saving our lives. Thank you..."
pi,NO!
pi,"Dolphins, Richard Parker!"
pi,What are you looking at...? Tell me. What do you see?
pi,"Storm! Storm, Richard Parker!"
pi,No!
pi,"Praise be to God, Lord of All Worlds, the Compassionate, the Merciful!"
pi,"We're dying, Richard Parker. I'm sorry."
pi,Richard Parker?
pi,"Excuse me... Go on, move!"
pi,Hey! Hey! Hey c'mon. Hey! Hey-get away. This is my bed!
writer,It was human tooth?
adult pi,"Don't you see, the island was carnivorous."
writer,Carnivorous? Like... a Venus flytrap?
adult pi,"Yes, the whole island - the plants, the water in those pools, the very ground itself. During the day, those pools held fresh water, but at night, some chemical process turned the water in those pools into acid - acid that dissolved those fish, that sent the meerkats scurrying into the trees and Richard Parker running to the boat."
writer,But where did the tooth come from?
adult pi,"Years ago, some poor fellow just like me must have found himself stranded on that island.... And like me he thought he might stay there forever. But all that the island gave him by day, it took away again by night. To think - how many hours spent with only meerkats for company? How much loneliness taken on? "
pi,RICHARD PARKER!
adult pi,"And then Richard Parker, my fierce companion, the terrible one who kept me alive, disappeared forever from my life."
adult pi,"After a few hours, a member of my own species found me. He left and returned with a group who carried me away."
adult pi,"You know, my father was right. Richard Parker never saw me as his friend. After all we'd been through, he didn't even look back. But I have to believe that there was more in his eyes than my own reflection staring back at me. I know I felt it - even if I can't prove it. I just wish...  You know, I've left so much behind. My family, the zoo, Anandi, India - I suppose in the end the whole of life becomes an act of letting go. But what always hurts the most is not taking the moment to say goodbye. I was never able to thank my father for all I learned from him, to tell him that without his lessons I would never have survived... And I know he's a tiger, but I wish I'd said: 'It's over. We've survived. Thank you for saving my life. I love you, Richard Parker. You will always be with me. May God be with you.'"
writer,I don't know what to say.
adult pi,"Hard to believe, isn't it?"
writer,"It is a lot to take in, to figure out what it all means."
adult pi,"If it happened, it happened. Why should it have to mean anything?"
writer,"Well, some of it is pretty incredible."
adult pi,"I was the only one who survived the shipwreck, so the Japanese shipping company sent two men to talk to me in the Mexican hospital where I was recovering. I still have a copy of their report.  Pi takes a tattered notebook out of the bookcase.  ADULT PI  They had insurance claims to settle, and they wanted to find out why the ship sank. They didn't believe me either.  Pi hands the notebook to the Writer. On top, there is a newspaper article with the headline ""BOY RESCUED: 227 DAYS IN THE PACIFIC."" The Writer unclips the article, revealing the insurance report beneath. We hear Okamoto's first line over the report."
okamoto,Thousands of meerkats? On a floating carnivorous island? And no one has ever seen it?
young pi,Yes. Just like I told you.
chiba,Bananas don't float.
okamoto, Why are you talking about bananas?
chiba,You said the orangutan floated to you on a bundle of bananas. But bananas don't float.
okamoto, Are you sure about that?
young pi,Of course they do. Try it for yourself.
okamoto,"In any case, we are not here to talk about bananas or meerkats."
young pi,I've just told you a long story. I'm very tired.
okamoto,We're here because a Japanese cargo ship sank in the Pacific.
young pi,Something I never forget. I lost my whole family.
okamoto, We don't mean to push you. And you have our deepest sympathies. But we've come a long way. And we're no closer to understanding why the ship sank.
young pi,Because I don't know. I was asleep. Something woke me up. It may have been an explosion; I can't be sure. And then the ship sank. What else do you want from me?
okamoto,We need a simpler story for our report. One our company can understand. A story we can all believe. 
young pi,So.... a story without things you never seen before.
okamoto,That's right.
young pi,Without surprises. Without animals or islands.
okamoto,Yes. The truth.
writer,So what did you do?
adult pi,I told him another story. Four of us survived...
young pi,"...The cook and the sailor were already onboard. The cook threw me a lifebuoy and pulled me aboard. Mother held onto some bananas and made it to the lifeboat. The cook, the cook was a disgusting man. He ate a rat. We had food enough for weeks, but he found the rat in the first few days - and he killed it, and dried it in the sun and ate it. He was such a brute, that man. But he was resourceful. It was his idea to build the raft to catch fish. We would have died in those first few days without him. The sailor was the same man who brought rice with gravy, the Buddhist. We didn't understand much of what he said, only that he was suffering. I can still hear him - the happy Buddhist who only ate rice with gravy. He had broken his leg horribly in the fall. We tried to set it as best we could, but the leg became infected and the cook told us we had to do something or he'd die. The cook said he'd do it, but mother and I had to hold the man down. And I believed him - we needed to do it.  I have to live with that. I was alone in a lifeboat, drifting across the Pacific Ocean. And I survived."
adult pi,"After that, no more questions. The investigators didn't seem to like the story, exactly - but they thanked me, they wished me well, and they left."
writer,"So...  the stories... Both the zebra and the sailor broke their leg. And the hyena killed the zebra and the orangutan. So ... the hyena is the cook. And the sailor is the zebra, mother is the orangutan... and you're... the tiger."
adult pi,Can I ask you something?
writer,Of course.
adult pi,"I've told you two stories about what happened out on the ocean. Neither explains what caused the sinking of the ship, and no one can prove which story is true and which is not. In both stories, the ship sinks, my family dies, and I suffer."
writer,True.
adult pi,So which story do you prefer?
writer,The story with the tiger. That's the better story.
adult pi, Thank you. And so it goes with God.
writer, Mamaji was right. It is an amazing story. Will you really let me write it?
adult pi,"Of course. Isn't that why Mamaji sent you here, after all?"
writer,I didn't know you had a wife.
adult pi,"And a cat, and two children."
writer,So your story does have a happy ending.
adult pi,"Well, that's up to you. The story's yours now."
writer," ...an adult Bengal tiger."""
pi," We have a guest. Let me introduce you...  THE WRITER stands and faces Pi. We see his POV - on Pi, holding his daughter in arms, surrounded by his family, smiling...  DISSOLVE TO:"
