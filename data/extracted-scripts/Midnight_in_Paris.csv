Speaker,Dialogue
helen,In this traffic nothing moves. GIL Well yes it was different then. JOHN Can we continue this talk of moveable feasts at Grand Vefour because I'm starved. GIL Americans eat dinner so early. JOHN And I'm proud of it. CUT TO:
helen, 7                                                                   7
inez,"Oh - how terrific. Dad's here on business and we free-loaded along. PAUL It's great.   We can spend some time together. GIL Don't we have a lot of commitments? INEZ What? CAROL What are you doing tomorrow?    We're driving to Versailles. INEZ I'm dying to see Versailles. GIL Don't we have something tomorrow? We were going to have lunch at the Brasserie Lipp. My old professor once actually saw James Joyce there. He said Joyce was eating sauerkraut and frankfurters.  INEZ Is that the end of the story? GIL It is actually - INEZ We'd love to go with you guys. Versailles is beautiful - I have to see it Gil - it's perfect for you with your obsession with ""les temps perdus"" GIL Yes - but - PAUL It's such a lovely treat running into you here. A demain. CUT TO: 8"
inez, I hope you're not going to be as anti-social tomorrow when we go to Versailles. GIL How was I anti-social? INEZ It was so clear you didn't want to go. GIL Well they're your friends and I can't say I'm as taken with him as you are. INEZ He's brilliant. I used to have such a crush on him at college. And Carol's very bright. GIL I find him a pseudo-intellectual. INEZ I hardly think the Sorbo nne would have him lecturing if he's a pseudo- intellectual. You should give him your novel to read. I'm sure he'd be able to critique your writing and show you why you're having so much trouble.
gil,I'm having trouble because I'm a Hollywood hack who never gave actual literature a real shot. INEZ  The studios adore you - you're in demand - I don't think you want to trade everything just to struggle. CUT TO:
helen,"It's definitely the nicest ring we've seen. INEZ I love a diamond wedding band. The way it sparkled they'll see it in the last row when he puts it on my finger. HELEN This is going to be such an event, Inez. I only wish - 12 CONTD: 11                                                              11"
inez," I don't want to keep going over it, Mom. HELEN Look, he's your choice.   What can I say? INEZ Gil's smart and successful. HELEN And yet he talks of g1.v1.ng it up and moving here. That frightens me. INEZ The world is full of people who dream of writing the great American novel. Let me handle him. HELEN You're father thinks you're comfortable with Gil because you can control him. INEZ He likes to please me - is that so terrible? Oh gosh - I have to go - Paul arranged a private tour of the Rodin Museum. CUT TO:"
omitted,12                                                                12
paul,"That would be in Meudon. He died of the flu if I'm not mistaken - 1917 I believe. GUIDE Exactly correct. You know your art history, monsieur. The design - PAUL  He's so knowledgeable, isn't he?"
guide,"Ah, non, non, je suis certaine."
gil,"I'm afraid she's right. I just read the recent two volume biography of Rodin - Rose was definitely the wife, Camille the mistress. PAUL You read that? Where did you read that? GIL I did - no question.    Camille- Rose. INEZ Don't forget, Dad invited you to join us at a wine tasting tonight. CAROL It'll be so fun. Paul's an expert on French wines. INEZ  When did you read the biography of Rodin? GIL Me? Why would I read a biography of Rodin? CUT TO:"
helen,"You should talk, John - especially for someone who once advocated the boycott of french wines. JOHN I'll always take a California wine but the Napa Valley is six thousand miles away. They laugh and drink. INEZ  To the little green Heinz pickle pin. CUT TO:"
inez,I'm not tired and I'm dying to dance. I'll just meet you back at the hotel. PAUL I'll take good care of her. GIL I - I - guess so CUT TO:
gil,"Where are we going? PHIL 36 rue de  Prenez du champagne - detendez-vous un peu. GIL I do like champagne. DENISE The night is young - drink up, drink up, drink up. GIL I'm drinking up. He drinks, befuddled. CUT TO: 20"
scott,As what? GIL Scott Fitzgerald and - SCOTT  21                                                                    21
gil," Hey lady, are you kidding me? ZELDA I know what you're thinking - this is boring - I agree - I'm ready to move on - let's do Bricktop's, Scott, I'm bored, he's bored, we're all bored. SCOTT Whatever you say, sweetheart. See if Cole and Linda want to come with. Coming? Gil stares open mouthed. CUT TO:"
scott, 24                                                       24
scott, Where are you going? JUAN BELMONTE Para reunirse con amigos en el St. Germain ...
zelda,He's going to St. Germain.   I'm going with him. 25 CONTD:  24                                                      24
scott,Zelda - ZELDA If you're going to stay and drink with him I'm going with the toreador. SCOTT 
hemingway,"She has him on yachts, at parties, jumping into swimming pools you're wasting your talent. SCOTT You don't understand her. HEMINGWAY  24                                                       24"
gil,Where they sell old things - memorabilia. Does that sound terrible to you? HEMINGWAY No subject is terrible if the story is true. If the prose is clean and honest and if it affirms courage and grace under pressure. GIL Would you do me the biggest favor in the world - I can't even ask HEMINGWAY What? GIL Would you read it? HEMINGWAY Your novel? GIL It's only about four hundred pages - if you could just give me your opinion. HEMINGWAY My opinion is I hate it. GIL You do? HEMINGWAY If it's bad I'll hate it because I hate bad writing and if it's good I'll be envious and hate it all the more. You don't want the opinion of another writer. GIL But there's no one I really trust to evaluate it - HEMINGWAY Writers are competitive. GIL I could never compete with you - 28 CONTD:  24                                                      24
hemingway,"You're too self-effacing - it's not manly. If you're a writer, declare yourself the best writer - but you're not the best as long as I'm around. Unless you want to put the gloves on and settle it. GIL No - no - that's okay - HEMINGWAY I won't read your novel but I'll tell you what I'll do. GIL Yes? HEMINGWAY I'll bring it over to Gertrude Stein. She's the only one I trust to read my work. No one discovers new talent like Gert - whether it's poetry, painting, music - She'll tell you if you have a book or not. GIL You could have Gertrude Stein read my novel? HEMINGWAY Give it to me. GIL I have to get it.   It's at the hotel. HEMINGWAY She gets back from Spain tomorrow. GIL  I'm so thrilled - my heart is beating. I'll go home and get it - I'll give it to you - I can't tell you what this means to me. To have Gertrude Stein read my novel - thank you, thank you - He exits the place. 29"
gil,"Calm yourself - get a grip, Gil - deep breaths - been quite a night - Fitzgerald - Hemingway - the Hemingway - Papa - where do I meet him - he never said. Gil goes to return to the cafe - he can't find the door, nor the club facade. It's gone. We are in the present and he searches the wall of a facade where he came out but he is in despair over the fact he can't find it. CUT TO:"
gil,"If I told you I spent time with Hemingway and Fitzgerald and Cole Porter - INEZ I'd be thinking brain tumor. GIL Can I tell you Zelda Fitzgerald is exactly as we've come to know her from articles and books - she's mercurial and moody and she does not get along with Hemingway - and Scott knows Hemingway's right about it but you can see how conflicted he is because he loves her - INEZ Right, right - er where's my cold cream - we should knock off the idle chatter because we're going to be late. GIL Actually I wanted to stay and work on my novel - it needs a little polishing. INEZ You can work on it later. And we can use Mom's decorator's discount. CUT TO:"
gil,"Eighteen thousand dollars? HELEN Oh wait, that's Euros so it's more - INEZ That's over twenty thousand dollars, Mom. HELEN Yes but it's very hard to find anything like this at home. INEZ She's right, Gil. GIL Yes but we haven't even found a house yet and I'm trying to keep expenses down so I can turn down jobs. HELEN You get what you pay for.     Cheap is cheap. GIL I know you love Malibu but - INEZ  27                                                                  27"
inez,What?   I'm not big on surprises. GIL You will be. Believe me. HELEN Look at these marvelous Blackamoors. I see them in your living room. CUT TO:l
inez,"Look - you want to walk the streets and ""drink in Paris by night"" - go ahead. I'm in the middle of a great book Carol lent me and if I'm asleep when you get in, don't wake me.  Get in. Gil gets in, car pulls off"
hemingway,"I believe that love that's true and real creates a respite from death. All cowardice comes from not loving or not loving well which is the same thing and when the man who is brave and true looks death squarely in the face like some rhino hunters I know or Belmonte who is truly brave, it is because they love with sufficient passion to push death out of their minds till it returns as it does to all men and then you must make really good love again. Think about it. CUT TO:"
stein,"I was just telling Pablo that this portrait doesn't capture Adriana. It has universality but no objectivity. PABLO Vous ne le comprenez pas correctment. Vous ne connaissez pas Adriana mais c'est tout ce qui la represente. STEIN No tu n'a pas raison. Look how he's done her - dripping with sexual innuendo. Carnal to the point of smoldering and yes she's beautiful but it's a subtle beauty - an implied sensuality.  ""Out of the Past was the name of the store and its products consisted of memories. What was prosaic and even vulgar to one generation had been transmuted by the mere passing of years to a status at once magical and also camp. """
adriana,"I love it.     I'm already - hooked? Hooked. STEIN I'll start it tonight. But first we have something to talk about. She collars Hemingway and they huddle to one side. Picasso has busied himself at a distant spot with a drink, sulking. This leaves Gil off with Adriana to chat. GIL Did my opening lines really get to you that strongly? ADRIANA The past has always had a great charisma for me. 38 CONTD:  31                                                       31"
gil,"Me too.     I was born too late. ADRIANA Oui, exactement. For me Belle Epoque Paris would have been perfect. The whole sensibility, the street lamps, the kiosks - the horse and carriages. And Maxims - then. GIL You speak very good English. ADRIANA No, not really. GIL Yes - and how long have you been dating Picasso? My god, did I say that? ADRIANA Pardon. GIL Oh - I - no, I didn't mean anything - you know - to pry  born in Paris? ADRIANA I was born in Bordeaux - I moved here to study fashion and - you don't want to hear this - GIL No, I do. ADRIANA I came here - to study with Coco Chanel - and I fell in love with Paris and also a very dark eyed, haunted, Jewish-Italian painter - and I knew Amedeo had another woman but still I couldn't resist moving into his apartment when he asked and it was a beautiful six months. GIL Not Modigliani? Was it Modigliani? You lived with Modigliani? 39 CONTD:  31                                                      31"
adriana,"You asked me so I'm telling you my sad story. With Braque also there was another woman - many - and now with Pablo - I mean Pablo is married but every day it's on again, off again - I don't know how any woman can stay with him - he's so difficult. GIL My god you are a whole different level of art groupie. ADRIANA Pardon. GIL Nothing - I'm - ADRIANA But tell me about yourself. Have you come to Paris to write because these days so many Americans feel the need to move here. Isn't Hemingway attractive? I love his writing. GIL Actually I'm visiting. ADRIANA Oh you must stay here. It's a wonderful city for artists and writers. GIL Believe me, I want to but it's not that simple. ADRIANA And I did fall madly in love with the start of your book so I want to hear the rest of it. Hemingway and Stein return. HEMINGWAY Come, let's all go for a drink up at Montmartre. 40 CONTD:  31                                                               31"
stein,We'll discuss your book as soon as I finish it. Where can I reach you? GIL Oh that's okay - I'll drop by - it'll be easier for you - if that's okay. STEIN We run an open house. ADRIANA You sure you won't come? GIL  One of these days I plan to steal you away from this genius who's great but no Miro. CUT TO:
gil, I'm Gil Pender - I was with Hemingway and Picasso - Pablo Picasso - Ernest Hemingway - I'm Gil Pender from Pasadena - the Cub Scouts - I failed freshman English - I'm Gil Pender and my novel is with Gertrude Stein - I once worked at The House of Pies. I'm little Gil Pender. And that girl was so lovely. CUT TO:
helen,It's a shame you two didn't come to the movies last night. We saw a wonderfully funny American film. I forget the name. GIL Wonderful but forgettable.     I've seen that picture. HELEN I know it was moronic and infantile and lacking any wit or believability but John and I laughed in spite of ourselves. INEZ What time did you get in?     I was dead asleep. GIL Not late. I find these midnight strolls are very good for me creatively - without the distractions of the day - I'll probably take another long walk tonight. INEZ We'll see.     Oh how about this? 42 CONTD: 34                                                            34
helen,"Oh look at these wonderful glass figures. As they're preoccupied, Gil is caught up by a woman who plays some old 78 records on an old phonograph and she's playing the Cole Porter tune Cole was playing the other night. GABRIELLE C'est jolie, no. GIL Yes - very beautiful. GABRIELLE Cole Porter. Vous aimez - you like Cole Porter? GIL Love his music - we're very close - Cole, Linda and I. She gives him a look. GABRIELLE Very pretty and tres amusant. He listens. Inez comes over. INEZ Gil - Gil - Gil? GIL  We can see all those beautiful water lilies at his home. CUT TO:"
paul, Ah - now here's a superb Picasso. 44 CONTD:                                                A36 A36
helen,Where did Gil run off to? INEZ Work - he likes to walk around Paris - the way the city is all lit up at night allegedly inspires him - It's okay. Paul and I are going dancing. HELEN Where's Carol? INEZ In bed with a bad oyster.  See you later. Thanks for dinner Dad.
john,No? I'd like to know where he goes every night. HELEN Well we know one thing - he doesn't go dancing. CUT TO:

gil,No you're wrong. I know. ZELDA How?   How? GIL Trust me.      I know. ZELDA But you just met us. How can you know anything. My skin hurts. I hate the way I look. GIL Take this.  42                                                                 42
gil,"I'll try and score some more for you. And I have some Xanax at the hotel - it's another one you'll like. ADRIANA Come on, we'll find a taxi. We'll see you home - things will be better in the morning. CUT TO:"
adriana,You never said you were getting married. GIL Yes - I - I mean it's in the future. ADRIANA Well good luck with your book and your wedding. GIL You'd like Inez - she has a sharp sense of humor - and she's sexy - not that we agree on everything. ADRIANA But the important things. GIL Actually the small things - the important things we don't - she'd like to live in Malibu and that I'd work in Hollywood - but I will say we both like - er - er Indian food - not all Indian food - pita bread - we both like pita bread - ADRIANA  I should go. Pablo will be missing me. GIL I'll walk you home - 53 CONTD: 43                                                           43
adriana,"NO, no  Finish your drink.      I live just around the corner. GIL No, I wouldn't think - ADRIANA I'd prefer to be by myself for awhile. Thank you for this evening."
gil,"In a dream - which is fine for you because you guys dabble in dreams. MAN RAY There is another woman? GIL Adriana is her name. And I felt drawn to her - but it wouldn't matter - men much greater than me, profound artists - she's drawn to geniuses - and they to her. DALI I see you with Christ - he is smiling while you are crucified on the heavy wooden cross of self- doubt. GIL Of course my biggest problem is reality. BuNuEL Reality is nothing more than a dream - we all exist in the dream of a dog. GIL I was born in the wrong time. DALI Time is all the mind. Time melts - the watches melt - the hands of the clock melt MAN RAY A man in love with a woman from a different era. I see a photograph. BuNuEL I see a movie. GIL I see an insurmountable problem. DALI I see - a rhinoceros. 56"
inez,Paul says we have to see the countryside. He's taking us for lunch at this beautiful little inn. I know you like making love in the morning but I find it much sexier late afternoon - just before we go out to dinner. Except I always have to explain to my parents why your cheeks look radiant. Hey- I'm not going to force you. I know you're hot on your writing. I'll be happy when you finish this book and move on. CUT TO:
gil,"Hello - Bonjour - I'd like to ask you a question about Rodin. GUIDE Yes? GIL He loved his wife, he also loved his mistress - is it really possible to be in love with two women? GUIDE He loved both in different ways. GIL God it's so French. Er - you remember me? GUIDE I do. Qui - you were with the group, the pedantic gentleman. GIL Yeah, pedantic - perfect word. You're very observant. I need some advice. I'd like a woman's take. A French woman - an observant French woman. I met some woman that I very quickly became smitten with. Smitten? GUIDE Uh-huh. GIL I'm engaged to be married. I know Rodin had a wife and a mistress but I'm American - we can't handle that - we're monogamous. GUIDE You're engaged and you met a new woman - GIL Yes. Her name's Adriana. Right now she's living with Picas-- with a Spaniard - er he paints - fairly well. 58 CONTD:  45                                                                45"
guide,"Yes - and does she love him?   Or you? GIL Love him or me? Well I hardly think, me. But we've just met. See, another very gifted man flirts with her, a writer. All these geniuses fall in love with her. And what am I? And then of course there's another big problem. I can't exactly explain. GUIDE Yes?"
gil,"I don't know whether to call it an age difference - or a problem of geography - I'm so messed up. I'm not Hemingway, I'm not Picasso, I'm not Rodin. I'm just a guy who was born too late. CUT TO:"

gil,"It's a little complicated to explain. Thanks for translating - GUIDE The writer clearly has feelings for this man Gil. That's your name, no? GIL She finds him no genius - naive and unassuming - that's not exactly dazzling. GUIDE To some women naivete is   endearing. And she's romantic. She    dreams of Belle Epoque Paris and a   gift of earrings and making love   with this man."
inez,Daddy got chest pains. GIL Really? JOHN I'm sure it's indigestion. HELEN Well we can't take a chance. INEZ Daddy had an angioplasty three years ago. JOHN They put a balloon in me.    Big deal. HELEN  59                                                        59

GIL I thought you'd like their simplicity. INEZ That's just it, they're too simple. HELEN I agree. INEZ Hey - where are my art nouveau earrings? GIL You probably didn't pack them. INEZ I've worn them here. GIL I guess you lost them.     They probably dropped off. INEZ Both of them?     My ears are pierced. HELEN I told you to keep everything in the hotel safe. INEZ You think it was the maid? HELEN It's always the maid. INEZ I remember seeing them there this morning. 69 CONTD:  59                                                      59"
helen,I would report the theft right away. INEZ I'll bet it was that maid. She was so snotty yesterday about turning out the beds. She goes to phone. GIL Gee I wouldn't jump to any conclusions. I mean an accusation of theft. INEZ  59                                                             59

stein," Gee, why don't I pick up half a dozen? I could clean up - but how's all this possible - I should have paid more attention in my physics class STEIN Well? GIL Oh er - I brought a rewrite of the first few chapters of my book and was hoping you would tell me if you thought I was on the right track. STEIN Leave it with me. GIL Er - have you heard from Hemingway? STEIN Oh yes, they've been back for days. The trip didn't work out. I knew they wouldn't hit it off. That's over. with Picasso too.

adriana,"He says they find this generation sterile and empty - GAUGUIN La Renaissance est beaucoup mieux - better to have lived during the Renaissance.

ADRIANA He says your clothes are very modern and original. GIL Er - yes - Monsieur Lauren - Ralph.  Shouldn't you be in Tahiti? GAUGUIN I? What? Yes - I live on the island - a much better life than here - better there - but then I miss Paris - up and back - Qu'est que vous faites dans la vie? ADRIANA What do I do? Je suis etudiante.

lautrec,Vous devriez la presenter a Richard. GAUGUIN He wants Degas to have you meet his friend Richard. 
gil,It's not the present for me - I'm from 2010. ADRIANA What do you mean? GIL I dropped in on you just the way we dropped in on the 1890's. ADRIANA You did? GIL I wanted to escape my present just like you wanted to escape yours. To a golden age. ADRIANA Surely you don't think the twenties are a golden age? GIL To me they are. ADRIANA But I'm from the twenties and I'm tellin~ you the golden age is the Belle Epoque. GIL Yes but don't you see - to these guys the golden age was the Renaissance. They'd all trade the Belle Epoque to paint alongside Michelangelo or Titian. And those guys probably imagine life was better when Kubla Khan was around. I'm having an insight. A minor one but that accounts for the anxiety of my dream. ADRIANA What dream? GIL Last night I dreamed I ran out of zithromax - and then I went to the dentist and there was no novacaine - these people have no antibiotics - 82 70                                                         70 CONTD:   
adriana,"What are you talking about? GIL And even in the twenties - no dishwashers - no 911 if your appendix bursts - no ""movies on demand"" ADRIANA But if we love each other what does it matter when we live? GIL Because if you stay here and this becomes your present, sooner or later you'll imagine another time was really the golden time. And so will I - I'm beginning to see why it can't work, Adriana. The present has a hold on you because it's your present and while there's never any progress in the most important things, you get to appreciate - what little progress is made - the internet - Pepto- Bismol. The present is always going to seem unsatisfying because life itself is unsatisfying - that's why Gauguin goes back and forth between Paris and Tahiti, searching - it's my job as a writer to try and come up with reasons why despite life being tragic and unsatisfying, it's still worth it. ADRIANA That's the problem with writers - you're all so full of words - but I'm more emotional. I'm going to stay and live in Paris' most glorious time. You made a choice to leave Paris once and you regretted it. GIL Yes, that one I regretted but it was a real choice and I made the wrong one. This is a choice between accepting reality or surreal insanity. 83 CONTD:  70                                                                     70"
adriana,"So finally you do love Inez more than me. GIL No - I love you - but this way lies madness - and if I'm ever going to write anything worthwhile I've got to get rid of my illusions and that I'd be happier in the past is one of them. ADRIANA Goodbye, Gil. GIL Goodbye Adriana.     Good luck. They kiss, she turns and goes to the table of artists. CUT TO:"

inez,"You're crazy - Paul and me? Where did you get such an insane notion? GIL From Ernest Hemingway. He thought it out and it makes perfect sense. INEZ Gil, your brain tumor's acting up again. GIL There's nothing crazy about Ernest Hemingway or Gertrude Stein or Fitzgerald or Salvador Dali - INEZ Nothing except they've all been dead for years.

inez,"Have you met someone else?      All those late night walks. GIL I was attracted to another woman but it was the whole deal - meeting Gertrude Stein and Hemingway and Dali and Scott and Zelda - INEZ Honey, you better listen to yourself. You're a psycho. You don't know what you're doing. You see everything here through magical colored glasses. You're a California film writer with a house in Beverly Hills with two Mercedes'. You're not some kind of twenties expatriate novelist. Her parents enter from the adjoining suite. HELEN What's going on?       We can hear every word. GIL If I'm not happy I'll move back. But right now I'm going to stay. INEZ With who? All your crazy hallucinatory friends? Mother was right about you - there's a part missing. JOHN said that first. ~"
