Speaker,Dialogue
voice,"3 billion human lives ended on August 29th, 1997. The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war Judgment Day.  They lived only to face a new nightmare, the war against the Machines..."
cigar biker,You forgot to say please.
trucker,Evening...
lloyd,"I can't let you take the man's wheels, son. Now get off or I'll put you down."
woman,...John?  John!  Get in here right now and clean up that pigsty of yours.
tim,"Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?"
john,Gimme that Phillips right there.
janelle,I swear I've had it with that goddamn kid. He won't even answer me.  Todd?  Are you gonna sit there or are you gonna do something?
todd,John!  Get your ass inside right now and do what your mother says!
john,"She's not my mother, Todd!"
tim,"Major moves, homes!  So... where is your real mom, anyway?  She dead or something?"
john,She might as well be.
silberman,"The next patient is a 29-year old female diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder. The usual indicators... depression, anxiety, violent acting-out, delusions of persecution.  Here we are."
silberman,"'Morning, Sarah."
sarah,"Good morning, Dr. Silberman.  How's the knee?"
silberman,"Fine, Sarah.  She, uh... stabbed me in the kneecap with a screwdriver a few weeks ago."
silberman,"The delusional architecture is interesting. She believes a machine called a ""terminator"", which looks human of course, was sent back though time to kill her.  And also that the father of her child was a soldier, sent to protect her... he was from the future too...  Let's move on, shall we?"
silberman,"Douglas, I don't like seeing the patients disturbing their rooms like this.  See that she takes her thorazine, would you?"
douglas,"Time to take you meds, Connor."
sarah,You take it.
douglas,Now you know you got to be good 'cause you up for review this afternoon...
sarah,I'm not taking it.  Now I don't want any trouble...
douglas,Ain't no trouble at all --
sarah,You... son of a... AAARRGH!!
douglas,"Last call, sugar."
john,Easy money!
tim,Where'd you learn all this stuff?
john,"From my mom.  My real mom, I mean.  Come on baby...  Let's go!"
tim,That her?
tim,"So she's pretty cool, huh?"
john,"Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested."
tim,No shit?
john,"Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?"
todd,"That's right, officer.  What's he done now?"
todd,"Well, you could if he was here.  Be he took off on his bike this morning.  Could be anywhere. You gonna tell me what his is about?"
janelle,"There was a guy here this morning asking about him, too."
todd,"Yeah, big guy.  On a bike.  Has that got something to do with it?"
todd,"Get the album, Janelle."
sarah,Kyle..?  You're dead.
reese,"I know.  This is a dream, Sarah."
sarah,Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
sarah,Hold me.
reese,I love you.  I always will.
sarah,"Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much."
sarah,They took him from me.
reese,It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
sarah,I know!
reese,"Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you."
sarah," I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission."
reese,Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
sarah,"Kyle, don't go!"
reese," There's not much time left in the world, Sarah."
video sarah,"... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --"
video silberman,Please continue...
video silberman,"Dreams about cataclysm, or the end of the world, are very common, Sarah..."
video sarah,"It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!"
video silberman,I'm sure it feels very real to you --
video sarah,"On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?"
video silberman,"Relax now, Sarah --"
video sarah,"You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!"
video sarah,"You're the one living in a dream, Silberman, not me!  Because I know it happens.  It happens!"
sarah,"I was afraid... and confused.  I feel much better, now.  Clearer."
silberman,Yes.  Your attitude have been very positive lately.
sarah,"It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to."
silberman,And what it that?
sarah,"You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son."
silberman,I see.  Let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  Now you think they don't exist?
sarah,They don't exist.  I see that now.
silberman,But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
sarah,"If I had, there would have been some evidence. They would have found something at the factory."
silberman,I see.  So you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
dyson,"Greetings, troops."
bryant,Mr. Dyson?  The material teams wants to run another test on the uh... on it.
dyson,Yup.  Come on.  I'll get it.
bryant,"Listen, Mr. Dyson, I know I haven't been here that long, but I was wondering if you could tell me... I mean, if you know..."
dyson,Know what?
bryant,Well... where it came from.
dyson,I asked them that question once.  Know what they told me?  Don't ask.
sarah,"So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?"
silberman,"You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today."
sarah,You have to let me see my son.  Please.  It's very important.  He's in danger.  At least let me call him --
silberman,I'm afraid not.  Not for a while.  I don't see any choice but to recommend to the review board that you stay here another six months.
sarah,YOU SON OF A BITCH!!
sarah,Goddammit.  Let me go!!  Silberman!  You don't know what you're doing!  You fuck!  You're dead! You hear me!!
silberman,Model citizen.
first girl,"Yeah, he was here about fifteen minutes ago.  I think he said he was going to the Galleria."
tim,"Some cop is scoping for you, dude."
terminator,Get down.
john,Whoa... time out.  Stop the bike!
john,"Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?"
john,No way!
john,"Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?"
terminator,I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
john,"This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?"
terminator,My mission is to protect you.
john,Yeah?  Who sent you?
terminator,"You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time."
john,This is deep.
john,"So this other guy?  He's a terminator too, right, like you?"
terminator,Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.
john,What does that mean?
terminator,Liquid metal.
john,Radical.
terminator,You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
john,Where we going?
terminator,"We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities."
john,Can I stop by my house?
terminator,Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
john,You sure?
terminator,I would.
john,"Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks but I gotta warn them.  Shit!  You got a quarter?"
janelle,Hello?
john, Janelle?  It's me.
janelle,"John?  Where are you, honey?  It's late.  You should come home, dear.  I'm making a casserole."
john, Something's wrong.  She's never this nice.
todd,"What the hell's the goddamn dog barking at? SHUT UP, YOU MUTT!"
john,The dog's really barking.  Maybe it's already there.  What should I do?
janelle," John?  John, are you okay?"
terminator, What's the dog's name?
john,Max.
terminator,"Hey, Janelle, what's wrong with Wolfy?  I can hear him barking.  Is he okay?"
janelle," Wolfy's fine, honey.  Where are you?"
terminator,Your foster parents are dead.  Let's go.
john,"I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?"
terminator,Anything it samples by physical contact.
john,Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
terminator,No.  Only an object of equal size.
john,"Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?"
terminator,"It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes."
john,"We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that.  For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there were some other guys.  She'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  So then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? I hated her for that.  We gotta get her out of there."
terminator,Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
john,"Oh, great.  And what happens to her?"
terminator,"Typically, the subject being copied is terminated."
john,TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
terminator,Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
john,"Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!"
john,"Hey, goddammit!  What's your problem?"
john,Help!  HELP!!  I'm being kidnapped!  Get this psycho off of me!
john,Let go of me!!
john,Oww!  Why'd you do that?
terminator,You told me to.
john,You have to do what I say?!
terminator,That is one of my mission parameters.
john,Prove it... stand on one foot.
john,Cool!  My own terminator.  This is great!
first jock,"Hey, kid.  You okay?"
john,"Take a hike, bozo."
first jock,"Yeah?  Fuck you, you little dipshit."
john,Dipshit?  Did you say dipshit?!  Grab this guy.
john,"Now who's the dipshit, you jock douchebag?"
john,Put the gun down!  NOW!!
john,Walk away.
john,Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
terminator,Of course.  I'm a terminator.
john,"Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!"
terminator,Why?
john,"Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!"
terminator,Why?
john,"You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this."
john,"Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.  You wanna come along, that's fine with me."
mossberg,He killed seventeen police officers that night. Recognize him?
mossberg,This one was taken by a Japanese tourist today.
weathersby,"Ms. Connor, you've been told that your son's missing.  His foster parents have been murdered, and we know this guy's involved.  Talk to us. Don't you care?"
mossberg,We're wasting out time.
silberman,"Sorry, gentleman..."
night nurse,"Running late, aren't you?"
night nurse,Your friends are on their way out now...
silberman,"Lewis, see these gentleman out and them lock up for the night."
night nurse,"Whatcha got, Lewis?"
night nurse,"Gotta check the gun first, Lewis."
silberman,You broke my arm!
sarah,"There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!"
douglas,Open the door!  The goddamn bitch is loose in the halls!
john,"Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?"
terminator,Right.
john,Swear.
terminator,What?
john,"Just say ""I swear I won't kill anyone."""
terminator,I swear I will not kill anyone.
terminator,He'll live.
sarah,Open it or he'll be dead before he hits the floor.
silberman,"It won't work, Sarah.  You're no killer.  I don't believe you'd do it."
sarah,"You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!"
silberman,Open the goddamn door!
sarah,Step back!
sarah,Down on the floor!  Now!
silberman,Get her!
silberman,"Go around, goddamnit!  Go around!!"
john,Mom!!  Wait!
sarah,"No!  Help me!  Goddamnit, it's gonna kill us all!!!"
john,"Mom, are you okay?"
terminator,Come with me if you want to live.
john,"It's all right, Mom.  He's here to help."
terminator,Go!  Run!
sarah,Out of the car!!
sarah,RIGHT NOW!
terminator, Hang on.
terminator,Drive.
john,Can you see anything?
terminator,Everything.
john,Cool.
sarah,You okay?
john,I said I was okay.
sarah,It was stupid of you to go there.
sarah,"Goddamnit, John, you have to be smarter than that.  You're too important!  You can't risk yourself, not even for me, do you understand? I can take care of myself.  I was doing fine. Jesus, John.  You almost got yourself killed."
john,"I... had to get you out of the place... I'm sorry, I..."
sarah,"Stop it!  Right now!  You can't cry, John. Other kids can afford to cry.  You can't."
terminator,What is wrong with your eyes?
sarah,So what's your story?
silberman,"... it was all true and we're all going to die and the changed, I saw him change!!"
terminator,"Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds."
sarah,Can it be destroyed?
terminator,Unknown.
sarah,Pull in here.  We have to ditch this car.
sarah,You look like handmade shit.
terminator,So do you.
terminator,I have detailed files on human anatomy.
sarah,"I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?"
terminator,Correct.
john,Does it hurt?
terminator,I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
sarah,Will these heal up?
sarah,"That's good.  Because if you can't pass for human, you won't be much good to us."
john,"How long do you live?  I mean, last?"
terminator,A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
john,Can you learn?  So you can be... you know. More human.  Not such a dork all the time.
terminator,"My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to ""read-only"" when we are sent out alone."
sarah," Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?"
terminator,No.
john,Can we reset the switch?
terminator,Now open the port cover.
terminator,Hold the CPU by its base tab.  Pull.
john,Can you see the pin switch?
john,No!!!!
sarah,"Out of the way, John!"
john,No!  Don't kill him!
sarah,"It, John.  Not him.  It."
john,"Alright, it!  We need it!"
sarah,We're better off by ourselves.
john,But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
sarah,"I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again."
john,"Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you won't, nobody else will."
terminator,Was there a problem?
john,No problem.  None whatsoever.
john,Are we learning yet?
sarah,Just head south.
sarah,Keep it under sixty-five.  We can't afford to be pulled over.
terminator,Affirmative.
john,"No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like ""Affirmative"" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo."
john,"It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say ""eat me""... if you wanna shine them on, it's ""Hasta la vista, baby""."
terminator,"""Hasta la vista, baby""?"
john,"Yeah, or ""later, dickwad.""  Or if someone gets upset you say ""chill out.""  Like that.  Or you can do combinations."
terminator,"Chill out, dickwad."
john,"That's great!  See, you're getting it."
terminator,No problemo.
sarah,You got any cash?
john,Only a couple hundred bucks.  I'll give you half.
sarah,Get some food.
john,No sense of humor.
john,"And that's another thing.  You could lighten up a bit, yourself.  This severe routine is getting old.  Smile once in a while."
terminator,Smile?
john,"Yeah.  Smile.  You know.  People smile, right? Watch."
john, Hi.  Nice place you got here.  How's business?
window woman, Gimme a break.
john," Okay.  Bad example.  Over there, look."
john,Like that.
john,"I don't know, maybe you could practice in front of a mirror or something."
first kid,You're dead!
second kid,Am not!
first kid,Are so!
john,"We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean."
terminator,It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
john,"Yeah.  Drag, huh?"
sarah,I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
terminator,"The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation."
sarah,Why him?
terminator,In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
sarah,Then what?
terminator,"In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record."
sarah," Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?"
terminator,"Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug."
sarah,And Skynet fights back.
terminator,Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
sarah,Why attack Russia?
terminator,Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
sarah,Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
terminator,I have detailed files.
sarah,I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
tarissa,You going to work all day?
dyson,"I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one..."
dyson,... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
tarissa,You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
dyson,I can't
tarissa,"Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today."
dyson,"Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here."
dyson,"Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --"
tarissa,"I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes."
dyson,"I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis close."
dyson,"Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot."
tarissa,"Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do."
dyson,I'm sorry.
tarissa,How about spending some time with your other babies?
sarah, Stay in the truck.
sarah, Enrique?  You here?
salceda,"You pretty jumpy, Connor."
salceda," Good to see you, Connor.  I knew you'd make it back here sooner or later."
salceda,"Oye, Big John!  Que pasa?  Who's your very large friend?"
john," Uncle Bob, this is Enrique."
salceda,"Hmmm.  Uncle Bob, huh?  Okay.  Yolanda.  Get out here, we got company.  And bring some fucking tequila!"
terminator,Uncle Bob?
salceda," So, Sarahlita, you getting famous, you know that?  All over the goddamn TV."
salceda,"Honey, take Pacolito.  Thanks, baby."
salceda, Drink?
sarah,"I just came for my stuff.  And I need clothes, food, and one of your trucks."
salceda," Hey, how about the fillings out of my fucking teeth while you're at it?"
sarah,"Now, Enrique.  You two are on weapons detail."
john,Hook it on.
john,One thing about my mom... she always plans ahead.
terminator,Excellent.
john,"Yeah, I thought you'd like this place."
salceda,"This is the best truck, but the water pump is blown.  You got the time to change it out?"
sarah,"Yeah.  I'm gonna wait till dark to cross the border.  Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.  You get out tonight, too, okay?"
salceda,"Yeah, Saralita.  Sure.  Just drop by any time and totally fuck up my life."
john,"See, I grew up in places like this, so I just thought it was how people lived... riding around in helicopters.  Learning how to blow shit up."
john,"Then, when Mom got busted I got put in a regular school.  The other kids were, like, into Nintendo."
john,Are you ever afraid?
terminator,No.
john,Not even of dying?
terminator,No.
john,You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
terminator,No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
john,"Yeah.  I have to stay functional too.  ""I'm too important""."
john,It's definitely you.
john,"There was this one guy that was kinda cool. He taught me engines.  Hold this a second.  Mom screwed it up, of course.  Sooner or later she'd always tell them about Judgment Day and me being this world leader and that's be all she wrote."
terminator,Torque wrench please.
john,Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
terminator,You will.
john,"Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye."
terminator,Why do you cry?
john,You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
terminator,Pain causes it?
john,"Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?"
terminator,No.
john,Alriight!!  My man!
terminator,No problemo.
sarah,"... if we are ever separated, and can't make contact, go to Enrique's airstrip.  I'll rendezvous with you there."
bike cop,Howdy.  I saw you pulled over here earlier. Everything okay?
salceda,"She said you go south with him...  ... tonight, like you planned.  She will meet you tomorrow in..."
john,Mommm!! Wait!!
john,"""No fate.""  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes ""The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."""
terminator,She intends to change the future somehow.
john,"I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!"
terminator,Dyson.
john,"Yeah, gotta be!  Miles Dyson!  She's gonna blow him away!"
john,Come on.  Let's go.  LET'S GO!!
terminator,This is tactically dangerous.
john,Drive faster.
terminator,The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
john,I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
terminator,Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
john,I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
john,"Look, maybe you don't care if you live or die. But everybody's not like that!  Okay?!  We have feelings.  We hurt.  We're afraid.  You gotta learn this stuff, man, I'm not kidding.  It's important."
dyson,"Run, kids!  Go!  Run!"
tarissa,Miles!  Oh my God!!
miles,Stay back!!
john,"Shit, we're too late!"
tarissa,Danny!  DANNY!
danny,Daaaaddddeeee!
sarah,"Don't fucking move!  Don't FUCKING MOVE!!  Get on the floor, bitch!  Now!!  Fucking down! NOW!!"
blythe,Don't hurt my father!
sarah," Shut up, kid!  Get out of the way!!"
dyson, Please... let... the kids... go...
sarah,Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
john,Mom?  You okay?
sarah,"I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?"
john,Uh huh.
john,It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
sarah,"I love you, John.  I always have."
john,"I know, Mom.  I know."
terminator,Clean penetration.  No shattered bone. Compression should control the loss of blood.
terminator,Do you have bandages?
dyson,"In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?"
dyson,Who are you people?
john,Show him.
dyson,My God.
terminator,Now listen to me very carefully.
dyson,I feel like I'M gonna throw up.
dyson,You're judging me on thing's I haven't even done yet.  Jesus.  How were we supposed to know?
sarah,"Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards."
john,"Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?"
tarissa,But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
dyson," That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,"
sarah, That's not good enough.
dyson,"Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?"
terminator,No one must follow your work.
dyson," Alright, yeah.  You're right.  We have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything I have here.  Everything! I don't care."
dyson,Do you know about the chip?
sarah,What chip?
dyson,They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
terminator, The CPU from the first terminator.
sarah,"Son of a bitch, I knew it!"
dyson,"They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know."
sarah,Those lying motherfuckers!
dyson,"I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it."
terminator,I must be destroyed.
sarah," Can you get us in there, past security?"

tarissa,"Miles, I'm scared.  Okay.  But the only thing that scares me more than you going... is you not going."
sarah, Is it safe for them here?

john,"No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!"
terminator,"I have to go away, John."
john,Don't do it.  Please... don't go --
terminator,It must end here... or I am the future.
john,I order you not to!
