mcmurphy,Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.
mcmurphy,"What's your name, buddy?"
billy,B-B-Billy.
mcmurphy,"Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy."
mcmurphy,What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
mcmurphy,"Yeah, that'll do for openers!"
harding,Does he have an appointment?
cheswick,"Yeah, do you have an appointment?"
mcmurphy,What for?
cheswick, What for?
harding,I'm a busy man!
cheswick, He's a busy man!
mcmurphy,I can wait...
harding, What are you doing?
mcmurphy,I'm seeing what a busy man does.
harding,"Your turn, Martini!"
cheswick,"Yeah, throw a club!"
harding,Don't you have any clubs?
martini,No!
harding,Let me see your hand!
martini,No!
harding," Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some pressing matters to attend to."
mcmurphy,"Yessir, that's why I came to this establishment for, to bring you birds fun and entertainment 'round the gamin' table..."
mcmurphy,"Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us..."
mcmurphy,"Yes, ma'am..."
mcmurphy," Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!"
billy,"Sure, Mack!"
big nurse,My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
mcmurphy,"Yes, ma'am."
big nurse,We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
mcmurphy,"Thank you, ma'am..."
big nurse,This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet.
mcmurphy,"Yes, ma'am..."
big nurse,"Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us."
mcmurphy,"Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me."
mcmurphy,"Yes, ma'am."
mcmurphy,"Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am."
mcmurphy,"Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse."
big nurse,"Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along."
mcmurphy,"Yes, ma'am.  Lead the way, Sam."
mcmurphy,"Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was."
spivey,"Oh, what was that?"
mcmurphy,Poker!
mcmurphy,"Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man."
mcmurphy,"They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal."
spivey,I see...
mcmurphy,"To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure..."
mcmurphy,"Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?"
mcmurphy,"I don't, Doc..."
mcmurphy,"That's correct, Doc ..."
spivey, The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
mcmurphy,"Doc, what can I tell ya?"
spivey,"Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?"
mcmurphy,"No, this is my first trip, Doc."
spivey," Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!"
mcmurphy,"You bet, Doc!"
spivey,Good. Good.
bancini,"I'm tired. Whew. O Lord. Oh, I'm awful tired..."
big nurse," Somebody please see to Mister Bancini, so we can start the meeting."
billy,"T-t-t-take it e-e-easy, P-P-P Pete..."
bancini,Awful tired...
big nurse,"At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?"
harding,"Yes, that's perfectly correct."
big nurse, So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
mcmurphy,"Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water..."
big nurse,"Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start?  Billy."
billy,M-m-m-ma'am?
big nurse,Would you like to start?
billy,"N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am."
big nurse,Mister Sefelt?
martini,No!
big nurse,Mister Scanlon?
harding,"Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct."
big nurse,But you have no proof.
harding,"No, Miss Ratched..."
big nurse,And yet you suspect her.
harding,"Yes, that is correct."
big nurse,Why?
harding,I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
big nurse,"Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?"
harding,"Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife."
sefelt,What's he talkin' about?
taber,"Yeah, Harding, why don't you knockoff the bullshit and get to the point."
harding,"The point is, I will carry on until I fully understand what the function of that relationship is regardless of form or content."
big nurse,"Yes, Billy?"
billy,I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
taber,"Yeah, Harding, you're so fuckin' dumb I can't believe it."
harding,That's a matter of opinion.
sefelt,"Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?"
fredrickson,Through the ass.
harding, Is that your sense of humor or are you trying to say something?
fredrickson, Now what would I be trying to say?
harding,"I don't know. I don't know, but it makes me feel very peculiar when you throw in something like that."
fredrickson,Peculiar?
sefelt,Why?
taber,"Yeah, why?"
scanlon,"Yeah, tell us why."
harding,I hesitate to go on.
big nurse,"No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open..."
harding,"I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something..."
taber,"You know what, Harding? I think you're some kind of morbid asshole or something. You've been talking about your wife evere since I can remember. You know, she's on your mind and blah, blah, blah and on and on and when are you going to wise up and turn her loose!"
fredrickson,"Yeah, wise up, Harding."
sefelt,"Yeah, turn her loose!"
acutes," Yeah, who do you think you are anyway?... He thinks he's God Almighty... He's a snob... He's a schmuck... Dumbbell... Creep... Cretin... Idiot... Get rid of him... Ship him upstairs..."
ruckly, Ffffffuck da wife...
bancini, Tired... Awful tired...
acutes, Zap him... Give 'im lobotomy... Cut his nuts off... He doesn't have any... Fag... Pervert.
bancini, I'm tired!
big nurse,Somebody see to Mister Bancini.
bancini,"Tired. Tired. Oh God, I'm tired..."
washington,"You a good boy, Mistah Bancini..."
bancini,You see... it's a lotta baloney... It's all a lotta baloney...
nurse pilbow,"Yes, yes, Mister Bancini, now if you'll just be calm..."
bancini,"That's all it is, just a lotta baloney. Ya see, I can't help it, can't..."
nurse pilbow," Yes, I know, I know..."
bancini,"... don't ya see. I was born dead. Not you. You wasn't born dead. Ahhh, it's been so hard...  Tired... I'm tired... aw-ful tired..."
martini, Catch it! Catch it!
washington,"Martini, there ain't nobody there, ya dumb goon! Go get the ball!"
martini,No!
mcmurphy,"Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?"
harding,A pecking party?
mcmurphy,"That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?"
mcmurphy,"Ah, come off it! It's that Big Nurse, that's who..."
harding,"It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party."
mcmurphy,"I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!"
harding,Did to me?
mcmurphy,Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
billy,Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
mcmurphy,What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
fredrickson,It's the questions she asks.
mcmurphy,Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
harding,"Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!"
mcmurphy," She ain't peckin' at your eyes, buddy."
mcmurphy,"She's peckin' at your balls, buddy, at your ever-lovin' balls."
sefelt,"That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend."
mcmurphy,P.A. What the hell is that?
fredrickson,Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
mcmurphy,Huh?
harding,"Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair."
mcmurphy,Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
mcmurphy,What for?
mcmurphy,Lobotomy?
mcmurphy, Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
harding,"Now, what would I be trying to say?"
scanlon,Gimme the ball!
martini,No. Me! Me!
mcmurphy," Pass it to me, Martini."
mcmurphy,"C'mon, I'll give it back!"
mcmurphy,"Atta boy, Martini."
mcmurphy," Back and forth, that's it. Shoot, man, we'll be takin' on the New York Knicks before we're through..."
sefelt,Hit me!
mcmurphy,"Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load."
sefelt,Boogered!
mcmurphy,"'Kay, place your bets."
martini, What's this?
mcmurphy,"That's a dime, Martini."
mcmurphy," Whadaya bet, Cheswick?"
cheswick,She won't give me any more cigarettes!
mcmurphy,That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
mcmurphy," 'Kay, all bets are down, let's wheel 'em an' deal 'em."
mcmurphy,"Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?"
martini,Hit me.
mcmurphy," Hey, Taber, who's pitching the opening game?"
mcmurphy,"Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?"
taber, Koufax against Ford!
martini, Hit me!
mcmurphy,"Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning..."
nurse pilbow," Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!"
mcmurphy,All I'm askin' is...
big nurse,Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
mcmurphy,"Sorry, ma'am."
mcmurphy," Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?"
big nurse," Yes, Mister McMurphy?"
mcmurphy,How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
big nurse," That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy."
mcmurphy," Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!"
mcmurphy,"Sorry, ma'am... Sorry 'bout that..."
mcmurphy,Sorry to have bothered you.
nurse pilbow,"Your medicine, Mister McMurphy."
mcmurphy," What's the horse pill for, honey?"
nurse pilbow,"It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes..."
mcmurphy,"Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!"
mcmurphy,"I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus..."
big nurse,"That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may..."
mcmurphy,"No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes."
harding,"Why didn't you tell her to go to hell, lover boy?"
taber,"Yeah, whattsa matter, Mack, she too much for ya?"
mcmurphy,"You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?"
harding,"I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?"
mcmurphy,"Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!"
turkle,"Le's get back to bed, Mistah Bromden..."
mcmurphy," Oh, does the spearmint lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight? When you chew it in the morning, will it be too hard to bite? This question's got me goin', won't somebody set me right; does the spearmint lose its flavor on the bedpost overnight?"
mcmurphy,"Here ya go, Chief..."
washington,"Le's go, Chief. Le's go get ourselves all nice and clean...  You too, Mistah Mack-Murphy!"
mcmurphy, Who the fuck stole my cigarettes!
big nurse,"Good morning, Mister Sefelt, are your teeth any better?... Good morning, Mister Fredrickson... Good morning, Mister Harding; my, my, you've been biting your fingernails again..."
mcmurphy,I wanna report a robbery!
big nurse,On this ward?
mcmurphy,"Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!"
mcmurphy,What for?
washington,"Yes, Miss Ratched?"
big nurse,Please see to Mister Bromden.
washington," Yes, Miss Ratched..."
big nurse,"Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy."
mcmurphy,"Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?"
big nurse,"After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast."
mcmurphy,"You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!"
big nurse,Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
mcmurphy,"'Kay, let's go brush our teeth, fellas..."
mcmurphy,"Oh, Lulu had a baby, His name was Sunny Jim, She put 'im in a piss pot, To teach 'im how to swim. Oh, he swam to the bottom, He swam to the top, Lulu got excited, An' pulled 'im by his... Cock-tail ginger-ale, Five cents a glass, An' if ya don't like it Ya can shove it up your... Ask me no more questions, I'll tell ya no more lies."
mcmurphy,"Why, if I'd have known how soft this place was gonna be, I'd have arranged for my transfer sooner...  All this place lacks is a couple of sweet gals to liven things up..."
mcmurphy,"Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'."
washington,Nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
mcmurphy,"Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam."
mcmurphy," Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?"
mcmurphy, Asshole.
big nurse,"Sit down, Mister Cheswick."
cheswtck, Mack???
big nurse,"Sit down, Mister Cheswick!"
cheswick,Yeah...
big nurse,"Good...  Now, as I recall, we were making quite a bit of headway, last time, with Mister Harding's problem. So, does anyone care to begin?"
mcmurphy,"Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem."
big nurse,"Certainly, Mister McMurphy."
mcmurphy,Right!
mcmurphy,"'Kay... Item one... I've been thinkin' 'bout the age problem we got on this ward. You know, the young an' old livin' together, an' I was thinkin' what a great thing it would be if the music was turned up louder. Louder so the old fellas could hear better..."
mcmurphy,"But then I got to thinkin', the music is so loud already, it makes it difficult for the young fellas to hold a decent conversation..."
mcmurphy,"Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?"
spivey,It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?
big nurse,"The point is well taken, Doctor, but do we have the necessary personnel to cover a second day room?"
spivey,"Well, since it will be largely the Chronics who remain here, one aide and one nurse should easily be able to handle any situation that might occur.  What do you think, men, is it workable?"
cheswick,"Right, Doc. It's workable."
spivey,Fine!
big nurse,"Good. Good. Yes, yes, I think we should give it a trial period. So! May we get back to Mister Harding's problem...  Yes, Mister McMurphy?"
mcmurphy,I'm not finished yet.
mcmurphy," 'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame."
big nurse,"Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!"
mcmurphy,Yeah?
mcmurphy,"The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!"
cheswick,I second the motion!
mcmurphy,"Atta boy, Cheswick!"
big nurse,"Very well! All those in favor, please raise your hands."
mcmurphy," Okay, raise your hands."
mcmurphy,"Come on', what is this crap? Who wants to watch the World Series?"
mcmurphy,No way.
cheswick,No way.
big nurse, Then I suggest we turn our attention back to Mister Harding's problem. Would anybody care to begin?
harding,"Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect..."
mcmurphy,"You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes."
martini,Hold it a minute.
cheswick,"Let's go, for Christsakes..."
mcmurphy,"It's your dirty roll, Cheswick."
mcmurphy,"Snake eyes! Hoooeee, that puts you on my Marvin Gardens, which means you owe me three hundred and fifty dollars."
martini,What's thum other things? Hold it a minute. What's thum other things all over the board?
cheswick, How can a man concentrate with you sitting there hallucinating a mile a minute...
mcmurphy,"You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon."
scanlon,"Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go...  Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini..."
mcmurphy,"Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody."
billy," Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway..."
mcmurphy,What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
harding,"A baseball game isn't worth the risk, my friend."
mcmurphy,"It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will!"
cheswick,Right!
fredrickson,"Oh, yeah?"
mcmurphy,Yeah!
sefelt,Big man!
mcmurphy,"Yeah, how much you wanna bet?"
mcmurphy,"That me an' my buddy, Cheswick, we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin' the ballgame while you suckers are sittin' around this goddamn nursery!"
harding,"And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?"
mcmurphy,That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
sefelt,Maybe he'll just show Miss Ratched his big thing an' she'll open the door for him.
mcmurphy,"Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt."
mcmurphy,"You think it's funny, huh?"
taber,"Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!"
mcmurphy,"Put your money where your mouth is, Taber."
mcmurphy, You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
mcmurphy,All right!
mcmurphy,"With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!"
harding,You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
mcmurphy,"You're fuckin' A-right, I am!"
mcmurphy,You heard me the first time!
taber,I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
mcmurphy,You're on!
billy,"M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!"
mcmurphy,"Stand aside, son. Any more takers?"
sefelt,I'll bet a dollar.
fredrickson,"Me, too..."
mcmurphy,Right!
martini,A nickel.
scanlon,A dime.
mcmurphy,Okay. Who else?
harding,Twenty-five dollars.
mcmurphy," Okay, Harding, you're on."
mcmurphy,"Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!"
harding,Giving up?
mcmurphy,Just warmin' up.
mcmurphy,"But I tried. Goddammit, I sure as hell did that much. Didn't I?"
billy,M-M-Mack...
harding,"Leave him alone, he's pouting."
billy,Y-Y-Y-You leave him alone!
mcmurphy,"That's okay, kid..."
mcmurphy,"No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off."
mcmurphy,What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
billy,"'K-k-kay, Mack!"
washington's pov,"Way down the hall, the Group Meeting is SEEN in progress."
big nurse,"Try, Billy, try..."
billy,Y-y-y-yes...
big nurse,Tell us about it...
billy,"I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing."
big nurse,"What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?"
billy, I was in luh-love with her.
