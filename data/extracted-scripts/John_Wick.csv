john," I'm up, I'm up."
iosef,Nice ride.
john,Thanks.
iosef,How much?
john,"It ain't for sale, kid."
iosef, Everything's got a fucking price.
john, Maybe so... but I don't.
john,Do you need to go out?
iosef,"I'm glad you didn't wanna' sell, old man.  I enjoyed this."
john,...Moose...
aurelio,Where'd you get that?
iosef,"I gots my ways, yo! Now, it's hot as shit, so I wanna paint job, papers, fuckin-"
aurelio," I said, where... did you get that?"
iosef, Some old fuck.
aurelio, I know this car.
iosef,What the fuck are you sayin'?
aurelio, Fuck... me.
iosef,What?
aurelio,Out.    Now.
iosef,What the fuck are you talking about?
aurelio,I'm talkin' about you takin' this fuckin' car and gettin' the fuck outta' my shop.
iosef,"Did you lose your shit, Aurelio? We own you. You do what we say."
aurelio,The fuck you do. Tell me...
iosef,No.  But I sure as hell fucked up his dog.
aurelio,You pull a gun? On me?   In my house?
viktor,The old man ain't gonna' like this.
aurelio,Maybe not.     But he'll understand.
iosef, ...the fuck jus' happened...?
aurelio,"Hello, John."
john,"Hello, Aurelio."
aurelio,"I have, but it's not here."
john,Where is it?
aurelio,"If I turn down the work, the Russians turn to Takeshi and his crew. You'll find them down on Third and Main."
john,Thank you.
aurelio,"Yes, John?"
john,...they killed my dog.
aurelio,"I know, John. I know... but ""they""...  ...""they"" are extremely dangerous people."
john," Aren't ""they"" always..."
guard #1,What are you-
mechanic #1, I DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK HE IS! HE JUST SHOWED UP AND STARTED SHOOTING!
john, Where can I find Iosef Tarasov?
driver, I don't know.
john, Thanks.
driver, Fuck.
aurelio,This is Aurelio.
aurelio," Yes, sir. I did."
aurelio,Because he stole John Wick's car.
viggo, Oh.
aurelio,And Viggo?
viggo,Yes?
aurelio,Your son killed his dog.
viggo," Good evening, Aurelio."
viggo, Close the door.
iosef,"Poor me a double, aye?"
viggo, Aye.
iosef, What'd I do?
viggo, You fucked up.
iosef,I don't know what y-
viggo,Yes.   You do.
iosef, So I stole a fucking car!   So fucking what?
viggo,Use that tone with me again...
iosef, Yes... father.
viggo,"It wasn't the ""what you did"", Iosef, which draws my ire, but ""who you did it to""."
iosef,What?  The old man?
viggo,"Careful, son... that old man happens to be three years younger than I."
viggo,"It got to him, though. Hell... How could it not? Even though he won every military distinction on record, including the Medal of HONOR-"
iosef, What kind of work?
viggo, What kind do you think?
iosef, Oh.
viggo,"Then one day, he fell in love and left the game. The years scrolled past, age set in, and he -like myself- had to watch the love of his life die. Suddenly alone, with no family to speak of, John deserved to live -and die- in peace.  Instead..."
viggo,"Until I say otherwise, you are under house arrest. Am I understood?"
iosef," Yes, sir."
viggo,John Wick.     Good God...
carlo,Let's see here...
edwardo,"Yeah, I'm thinkin' he's the one."
roberto,Should we even bother?
edwardo,Protocol's protocol. Stay put. I'll make this quick.
edwardo,"Evenin', John."
john,"Evenin', Ed."
edwardo,You workin' again?
john,No...just sorting out a few things with the Russian mob.
edwardo,"Ah. Well, then... sort that out however you see fit. I'll cover your ass on my side of the fence as best I can."
john,"Thanks, Ed... but you still owe me."
edwardo,"That, I do.  Good night, John."
john,"Good night, Ed."
edwardo,"Earlier today, there was an incident involving a `69 Mustang-"
john,"Yeah, that was me."
edwardo,"Oh. Well, then... I'd recommend you find yourself a new ride for the time being. The heat on that make ain't gonna' die down for quite some time."
roberto,Well?
edwardo, Who's next on the list?
john,"This is Wick. John Wick, that's right. Yeah, it has been awhile.  I'd like to make a reservation for four."
charlie,"Good to see you, John."
john,"You, too, Charlie."
charlie,I was sorry to hear about Norma.
john,Thanks.
charlie,"She was always kind to me.  So, what have you been doing to pass the time?"
john,I got me a hobby or two.
charlie,"I can see that.  Tell me, John... are we back in the game, now?"
john,"Sorry, Charlie, but no.     I'm on my own nowadays."
charlie," That is a pity. I find the new breed of your ilk unstable, ill- wrought, and tiresome. The overused adage holds true: they don't make `em like they used to, John."
john," No, they don't."
goon #1,"We're a go, boss."
charlie,Excellent.
john,Thanks.
charlie,"My pleasure, John... and might I be expecting more such visitations?"
john,I make no promises on that.
charlie, Well said.
john,"See ya', Charlie."
viggo, Yes?
marcus,Yes?  Life?
viggo,"Good, good.  I've a favor to ask. One that pays quite well."
marcus,"As I keep telling those -like you- who keep calling, Viggo... I'm retired."
evan, Pockets.
manager,"Hello, sir. How may I help you today?"
john,I called ahead.     Reservation for John Wick.
manager,"Ah, yes.   I have you for two nights."
john,"Depending on business, it may be more."
manager,"That's not a problem, sir. We're only at sixty percent capacity. "
john," Y'know, I haven't been here in years. When did the old girl get a facelift?"
manager,About twelve years ago.
john,Same owner?
manager, Same owner.
john,Is she still singin'?
manager,"She is. Daily, in fact.   Round about midnight."
john,That's good to hear.
manager,"Floor seven, room nine.  Would you like help with your bags?"
john,"No, thanks."
manager,"Will there be anything else then, sir?"
john," Can you send me up a hamburger - rare, mustard, onions, pickle- and fries?"
manager," Yes, sir. And to drink?"
john,A nice Pinot. Mid-range. I'll leave that to your discretion.
manager,"Yes, sir. I have one in mind. It'll be up in a half-hour."
john,Thank you.
bouncer,Name?
john,Guest.
bouncer,Welcome.
john,Thanks.
john,Thanks.
bartender,What can I get you?
john,A table.
bartender,This way.
bartender, Enjoy.
waitress,"This way, sir."
john,"Yes, thank you."
waitress,What would you like to drink?
john,"Single Malt. Irish, if you've got it."
waitress,"Yes, sir. I've got a ten-year Michael Collins."
john,Perfect. Do you have a meat and cheese plate?
waitress,I do.   Anything else?
john,No.   Thank you.
viktor," Another bottle of the Goose, love!"
viktor,Hello?
viktor, What the fuck d-
john, My name is John Wick. You took my car. You killed my dog. Where... is Iosef?
viktor,"Fuck you, old m-"
john,And where is Viggo?
viktor,"He moves about... from one place to the next... he's put Iosef under his thumb... wherever Viggo goes, so does Iosef."
john, Where... is... Viggo?
viktor, Please... I don't know... please...
john,Please close out my tab.
waitress,"Yes, sir.  Thank you, sir."
john,Good evening.
waitress,"Good evening, sir."
iosef," Hey, Vik."
john,"As for the car, I got that back, but as for Moose, well... I'm takin' a page from Exodus on that one: an eye for an eye.  No... no, better yet, Genesis."
john,"Make your peace with God, Iosef...  ...for the Devil shall see you soon."
manager," Good evenin', sir."
john,Evenin'.    Is the doctor in?
manager,"Yes, sir.    Twenty-four/seven."
john,"Send him up, please."
manager,"Yes, sir.    Anything else, sir?"
john,Depends.    How good's your laundry?
manager,"The best, sir, however, I'm sorry to say that...  ...no one's that good."
john,"No, I thought not.  Send me up a beer, too, will you?"
manager,"Yes, sir.    What do you favor?"
john,Anything cold.
john,Did she chip off?
doctor,"Lucky for you, no.   It looks to be a sub-sonic."
john,Good to hear.
john,What sort of movement am I lookin' at?
doctor,"If you're lookin' to heal right quick, then keep it marginal. However, if you've still...  ...got a bit a' business to attend to..."
john,And after?
doctor,"It'll hurt like hell, son... but come the long run, you'll be fine."
john,"Thanks, doc."
doctor,"It's what I do.  Evenin', John."
john,Evenin'.
eddie, I don't know you.
john,Maybe not... but I know this place.
eddie,You carryin'?
john,No.   Wait...
eddie,You gotta' name?
john,John Wick.
eddie,Oh.
john,How about you?
eddie,What about me?
john,You gotta' name?
eddie,They call me Eddie.
john," Pleased to meet you, Eddie."
eddie,"Same goes for me, Mr. Wick."
john,"Please... call me, John."
john,"Hello, Winston."
winston,"Hello, Jonathan.  It's been awhile."
john,"That, it has.  I'm glad to see the old place still up and runnin'."
winston, I could say the same for you.
jimmy,Ho... lee... shit.
john,"Hey, Jimmy."
jimmy,"John, my God, it's been... what?"
john,"I'm no good with time, but... it's been awhile."
jimmy,"That, it has.  We we're all broken up over Norma, y'know."
john,"She got the card, the flowers... she knows you -all of you- loved her.  And thanks, Jimmy. It meant a lot to me as well."
jimmy,"Well, shit, it's good to see you, John. What can I get you?"
john,I'd love a martini.
jimmy,"Gin, dry, and onions?"
john,Good man.
jimmy,Go on and take a seat.    I'll be with you in a moment.
john,"Thanks, Jimmy."
jimmy,"All good, John... and seriously... it's good to see you."
jenny,"John Wick in the flesh... my, oh, my... will wonders never cease."
john,"Hey, Jenny."
jenny,Where've you been keepin' yourself?
john,"I'm not quite sure, but with that said... here I am."
jenny,"Here you are, indeed.   My, oh, my..."
john,I know.
jenny,"And I haven't... I mean, not since the last time...  You can say, ""no""."
john," No, no, Jenny... go right ahead. In fact... please do. I'd like to hear it, too."
jenny,Will do.
john,"No, ma'am."
jenny,"Well, then... you be safe, you hear?"
john, I hear.
jimmy,Enjoy.
jenny,"It's been awhile, but... here's to the past... may it influence our future."
david, ...please...
john, Do you know where Iosef is?
david,"No, sir."
john,Do you know where Viggo is?
david,"N-no, sir."
john, Do you know anythin' worth knowin'?
david,"Wait, wait!  Little Russia. There's a small bank near Cannon Court..."
john,What about it?
david,Viggo owns it. It's where he keeps his money. Every dollar of business he does clears through that building.
john, That'll do.
harry,Do I know you?
john,I'm thinkin' so.
harry,"Oh.    Hey, John."
john,"Hey, Harry."
harry,"Good night, John."
john," Hey, Harry."
harry,"Yeah, John?"
john,You keen on earnin' a coin?
harry," Times bein' as they are? Yeah, John... I am."
john,"Do you mind babysittin' the breathin' one for, I dunno...  ...the next six hours or so?"
harry,Catch and release?
john, Catch and release.
harry,Can do.
john,"Good night, Harry."
harry,"Good night, John."
manager,"Good evening, Mr. Wick. I'm sorry to be calling you at this hour, but we've received a number of noise complaints from your floor."
john,You don't have to worry about that anymore. I'll be going to bed soon.
manager,"Have you any need of -say- a dinner reservation, perhaps?"
john,"Yes, in fact.  For four."
manager,Six o'clock?
john,"Perfect. Oh, and...  Excellent. I'll need a car, and... well... something a bit less trivial."
john,"You willin' to put a bullet in my back, Marcus?"
marcus,"I owe you, John."
john,"Been awhile, Marcus."
marcus,"Too long, I'd argue."
john,Why'd you take the job then?
marcus,"Because if not for me, it would have been someone who'd have just now pulled the trigger and simply walked away, leaving you to gasp your last."
john," Much appreciated, then."
marcus,"Besides, we're the last of our kind; an endangered species of a sort. And I find comfort in knowing that there's someone like me still out there."
john," What am I doing, Marcus? I mean... it is just a... was a... dog, but..."
marcus,"It's always ""just"" something, John. "" "
john, This isn't like me.
marcus," Maybe not, but for the rare   man of our ilk -those who survived   an arguably unsurvivable life-   the few things we find time to care   for... pass long before we do..."
john,"Good night, Marcus."
viggo, Wait in the car.
waitress, Cream or sugar?
viggo,"No, thank you."
john,"Yeah, that's about right."
viggo,"Left the game, got married, settled down... I envy that.  Kids?"
john,No.
viggo,Lucky bastard.
john,"We tried, but... wasn't in the cards."
viggo,"I fucked a bartender and -ta dah!- nine months later, I had me a piece a' shit tossed on the old doorstep, but... when it comes down to it...  He's still my son."
john, I figured as much.
viggo,Funny how one would both die and kill for something they do not love.
john,Imagine what one would do if they did.
viggo,"Goodbye, John."
john,"Goodbye, Viggo."
viggo,Kill him.
viggo,DRIVE!
viggo,"People don't change. Do they, John?  SHUT... THE FUCK... UP!"
kirill,Babushka.
waitress,What can I get you?
john,"Americano, please.    And a bear claw."
waitress,On it.
john,"Oh, and the bathroom?"
waitress,Down the hall to the left.
john,Thanks.
john,EVERYBODY OUT!  NOW!!!!
bank manager,But... why not... me?
john,Take me to Viggo's stash.
bank manager,Wha... what?
john,"His stash. Personal Holdings.  Piggy ""fucking"" Bank."
bank manager,What?!?      I can't just-
john,Open it.
bank manager,I can't.
john,Open it.
bank manager,He'll kill me!
john,So will I.
bank manager,"Now, p-"
bank manager,...fuck... me...
waitress,Anything else?
john,That'll do. Thank you.
john, No cops. That's new.
waitress,"We good, hon?"
john,"Yeah.    Yeah, we're good. Thanks."
waitress,Anytime.
viggo, Where's the manager?
gunmen, GET IN! NOW!
viggo, ...no...
john,"Unless I complete the call, then... yes."
viggo,For me to die like this...  ...would be unfortunate.
worker,FILL HER UP!
iosef,How the fuck long do I have to stay down here?
captain,"Until we are at sea, and even then, your access up top will be limited."
iosef, What about him?
captain,He is dead.
iosef,What?
captain,I'm sorry.     He was k-
operator,Someone's shooting at u-
captain,Until you hear otherwise... stay.
sniper,This is Alpha. I don't-
gunmen,RUN!
captain,My... God.
crewman #1,What do we do?
captain,I-
crewman,Captain... he's coming.
iosef,"Yes, sir."
captain,"Good. Follow me. And if you shoot me in the back, I'll be the one to fuckin' kill you."
captain,"You piece of shit, motherfucker!"
iosef,"Well, come on, muthafucka!   LET'S DANCE! YOU AND ME!"
john,No.   I didn't.
iosef,NO!    HELP ME! NO! N... 
john, Through and through... through and through...
john,"Miko, huh?"
john,"Good girl, Miko... good girl."
