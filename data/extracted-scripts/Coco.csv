street vendor,"De nada, Miguel!"

miguel,Sit. Down. Roll over.        Shake. Fist bump.
miguel,"Good boy, Dante!"
tour guide,"And right here, in this very plaza, the young Ernesto de la Cruz took his first steps toward becoming the most beloved singer in Mexican history!"
9., DE LA CRUZ  When he was crushed by a giant bell.  CUT TO:
plaza mariachi," Ay, ay, ay, muchacho."
miguel,Huh?
plaza mariachi,"I asked for a shoe shine, not your life story."
miguel,"Oh, yeah, sorry."
miguel,I just can't really talk about any of this at home so...
plaza mariachi,"Look, if I were you I'd march right up to my family and say, ""Hey! I'm a musician. Deal with it!"""
miguel,I could never say that...
plaza mariachi,"You ARE a musician, no?"
miguel,I don't know. I mean... I only really play for myself--
plaza mariachi,"Did de la Cruz become the world's best musician by hiding his sweet, sweet skills? No! He walked out onto that plaza and he played out loud!"
miguel,"Uh-uh, my family would freak!"
plaza mariachi,"Look, if you're too scared, then, well... have fun making shoes."
miguel,...Seize your moment?
plaza mariachi,"Show me what you got, muchacho. I'll be your first audience."
miguel,Abuelita!
abuelita,What are you doing here?
miguel,Um...uh...
abuelita,You leave my grandson alone!
plaza mariachi,"Doa, please -- I was just getting a shine!"
abuelita,"I know your tricks, mariachi!  What did he say to you?"
miguel,He was just showing me his guitar...
to berto,Shame on you!
abuelita,"My grandson is a sweet little angelito querido cielito -- he wants no part of your music, mariachi! You keep away from him!"
abuelita,"Ay, pobrecito! Ests bien, mijo?"
abuelita, You know better than to be here in this place! You will come home. Now.
to berto,How many times have we told you -- that plaza is crawling with mariachis!
miguel,"Yes, To Berto."
miguel,"No, no, no!"
abuelita,"Go away, you! Go!"
miguel,It's just Dante...
abuelita,"Never name a street dog.         They'll follow you forever.  Now, go get my shoe."
abuelita,I found your son in Mariachi Plaza!
pap, Miguel...
mam,You know how Abuelita feels about the plaza.
miguel,I was just shining shoes!
to berto,A musician's shoes!
miguel,But the plaza's where all the foot traffic is.
pap,"If Abuelita says no more plaza, then no more plaza."
miguel, But what about tonight?
pap franco,What's tonight?
miguel,Well they're having this talent show-
miguel,And I thought I might...
mam,...Sign up?
miguel,"Well, maybe?"
prima rosa, You have to have talent to be in a talent show.
primo abel,"What are YOU going to do, shine shoes?"
abuelita,It's Da de los Muertos -- no one's going anywhere. Tonight is about family.
abuelita,Ofrenda room. Vmonos.
abuelita,"Don't give me that look. Da de los Muertos is the one night of the year our ancestors can come visit us.  We made all this food -- set out the things they loved in life, mijo. All this work to bring the family together. I don't want you sneaking off to who-knows-where."
miguel,I thought we were done...
abuelita,"Ay, Dios mo... Being part of this family means being HERE for this family... I don't want to see you end up like--"
miguel,Like Mam Coco's pap?
abuelita,Never mention that man!      He's better off forgotten.
miguel,But you're the one who--
abuelita,"Ta, ta, ta-tch!"
miguel,I was just--
abuelita,Tch-tch!
miguel,But--
abuelita,Tch!
miguel,I--
abuelita,Tch-tch!
mam coco,Pap?
abuelita,"Mam, clmese, clmese."
mam coco,Pap is coming home?
abuelita,"No Mam.   It's okay, I'm here."
mam coco,Who are you?
abuelita,"Rest, Mam."
miguel,"Oh, it's you. Get in here, c'mon, Dante. Hurry up.  Dante wriggles into the hideout. Miguel is huddled over something. The dog peeks around his shoulder.  MIGUEL  I have to sing. I have to play. The music, it's -- it's not just in me. It is me."
miguel,...and make it come true.
miguel,"No more hiding, Dante.      I gotta seize my moment!"
abuelita,Da de los Muertos has begun!
mam,"No, no, no, no, no."
pap,"Mam, where should we put this table?"
abuelita,"In the courtyard, mijos."
pap,You want it down by the kitchen?
abuelita,S.   Next to the other one.
miguel,"Get under, get under!"
miguel,Nothing!
pap,Miguel...  We've all decided -- it's time you joined us in the workshop!
miguel,What?!
pap,No more shining shoes -- you will be making them! Every day after school!
abuelita,Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to carrying on the family tradition! And on Da de los Muertos! Your ancestors will be so proud!
pap,"And wingtips, like your Pap Julio--"
miguel,But what if I'm no good at making shoes?
pap,"Ah, Migue... You have your family here to guide you...  You are a Rivera. And a Rivera is...?"
miguel,...A shoemaker. Through and through.
pap,"That's my boy!  Berto, break out the good stuff, I wanna make a toast!"
miguel,"Dante!   No, Dante, stop!"
miguel,De la Cruz's guitar...?
mam coco,Pap?
miguel,"Mam Coco, is your pap... Ernesto de la Cruz?"
mam coco,Pap!   Pap!
miguel,"Ha, ha!"
miguel,Pap!   Pap!
mam,Miguel!   Get down from there!
miguel,Mam Coco's father was Ernesto de la Cruz!
pap,What are you talking about?
miguel,I'm gonna be a musician!
abuelita,What is all this? You keep secrets from your own family?
to berto,It's all that time he spends in the plaza...
ta gloria,...Fills his head with crazy fantasies!
miguel,It's not a fantasy!
pap,"We've never known anything about this man. But whoever he was, he still abandoned his family. This is no future for my son."
miguel,"But Pap, you said my family would guide me! Well de la Cruz IS my family! I'm supposed to play music!"
abuelita,Never!    That man's music was a curse!    I will not allow it!
miguel,If you would just let--
mam, Miguel--
pap,You will listen to your family.    No more music.
miguel,Just listen to me play--
pap,End of argument.
abuelita,You want to end up like that man? Forgotten? Left off your family's ofrenda?!
miguel,I don't care if I'm on some stupid ofrenda!
miguel,No!
pap,Mam...
abuelita,"There. No guitar, no music. "
miguel,I don't wanna be in this family!
pap,Miguel!   MIGUEL!
miguel,I wanna play in the plaza. Like de la Cruz! Can I still sign-up?
stage manager,You got an instrument?
miguel,No... But if I can borrow a guitar--
stage manager,"Musicians gotta bring their own instruments...  You find a guitar, kid, I'll put you on the list."
miguel,"Excuse me, can I borrow your guitar?"
miguel,You guys have a spare guitar?
miguel,"I need a guitar, just for a little bit--"
miguel,Great-great grandfather... What am I supposed to do?
miguel,"No, no, no, no, no, Dante stop! Cllate! Shhh!"
miguel,I'm sorry...
miguel,"Seor de la Cruz? Please don't be mad. I'm Miguel, your great-great grandson... I need to borrow this."
groundskeeper,"Alright, who's in there?"
miguel,I... I'm sorry! It's not what it looks like! De la Cruz is my...
groundskeeper,There's nobody here!
mam,Miguel!
miguel,Mam!
pap,Miguel!   Come home!
pap,"Where are you, Miguel?!"

pap julio,...Then we are going to her! Vmonos!
miguel,Whoa...
pap julio,"Come on, Miguel. It's ok."
miguel,"Dante!   Dante! Dante, wait up!"
miguel,"This isn't a dream, then.        You're all really out there..."
ta victoria,You thought we weren't?
miguel,"Well I don't know, I thought it might've been one of those made up things that adults tell kids... like... vitamins."
ta victoria,"Miguel, vitamins are a real thing."
miguel,"Well, now I'm thinking maybe they could be..."
skeleton mother,"Mija, it's not nice to stare at--  Ay! Santa Maria!"
miguel,Are those...? Alebrijes!         But those are--
to oscar,REAL alebrijes. Spirit creatures...
ta rosita,They guide souls on their journey...

arrivals agent,How wonderful! Next!
departures agent,"Next family, please!"
elderly couple,Gracias.
departures agent,Next!
juan ortodoncia,Grashiash!
departures agent,Next!
hctor,"Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo.  Shall we skip the scanner? I'm on so many ofrendas, it'll just overwhelm your blinky thingie..."
departures agent,"Well shoot. Looks like no one put up your photo, Frida..."
hctor,"Okay, when I said I was Frida... just now? That... that was a lie. And I apologize for doing that."
departures agent,"No photo on an ofrenda, no crossing the bridge."
hctor,"You know what, I'm just gonna zip right over, you won't even know I'm gone."
hctor,Ha HA!
hctor,"Almost there, just a little further...!"
officer,Upsy-daisy...
hctor,"Fine, okay. Fine, who cares... Dumb flower bridge!"
ta rosita,I don't know what I'd do if no one put up my photo.
ta rosita,"Oh!   Come mijo, it's our turn."
arrivals agent,"Welcome back, amigos! Anything to declare?"
pap julio,"As a matter of fact, yes."
miguel,Hola.
miguel,Whoa...
to oscar,I miss my nose...
distressed traveler,C'mon! Help us out amigo... We gotta get to a dozen ofrendas tonight...
miffed wife,We are NOT visiting your ex-wife's family for Da de Muertos!
mam imelda,I demand to speak to the person in charge!
case worker,"I'm sorry, seora, it says here no one put up your photo--"
mam imelda,My family always -- ALWAYS -- puts my photo on the ofrenda! That devil box tells you nothing but lies!
pap julio,Mam Imelda?
mam imelda,"Oh, mi familia! They wouldn't let me cross the bridge! Tell this woman and her devil box that my photo is on the ofrenda."
pap julio,"Well, we never made it to the ofrenda..."
mam imelda,What?!
pap julio,We ran into... um...
mam imelda,Miguel?
miguel,Mam Imelda...
mam imelda,What is going on?
clerk,You the Rivera family?
clerk,"Well, you're cursed."
miguel,What?!
clerk,Da de los Muertos is a night to GIVE to the dead. You STOLE from the dead.
miguel,But I wasn't stealing the guitar!
mam imelda,Guitar...?
miguel,"It was my great-great grandfather's, he would have wanted me to have it--"
mam imelda,Ah-ah-ah! We do not speak of that...  ...musician! He is DEAD to this family!
miguel,"Uh, you're all dead."
clerk,"ACHOO! I am sorry, whose alebrije is that?"
miguel,That's just Dante.
ta rosita,He sure doesn't look like an alebrije.
to oscar,He just looks like a plain old dog...
to felipe,...Or a sausage someone dropped in a barbershop.
clerk,"Whatever he is, I am -- ACHOO! -- terribly allergic."
miguel,But Dante doesn't have any hair.
clerk,"And I don't have a nose, and yet here we are -- ACHOO!!"
mam imelda,But none of this explains why I couldn't cross over.
miguel,Oh...
mam imelda,You took my photo off the ofrenda?!
miguel,It was an accident!
mam imelda,How do we send him back?!
clerk,"Well, since it's a family matter...  The way to undo a family curse is to get your family's blessing."
miguel,That's it?
clerk,"Get your family's blessing, and everything SHOULD go back to normal. But you gotta do it by sunrise!"
miguel,What happens at sunrise?
pap julio,Hjole!   Your hand!
pap julio,"Whoa, Miguel. Can't have you fainting on us."
clerk,"But not to worry! Your family's here, you can get your blessing right now."
clerk,"Cempaschil, cempaschil.        Aha! Perdn, seora."
clerk," Now, you look at the living and say his name."
mam imelda,Miguel.
clerk,Nailed it.     Now say: I give you my blessing.
mam imelda,I give you my blessing.
miguel,What?   She can't do that!
clerk,Well technically she can add any conditions she wants.
miguel,Fine.
clerk, Then you hand the petal to Miguel.
miguel,No skeletons!
miguel,"Mariachi Plaza, here I come--"
mam imelda,Two seconds and you already break your promise!
miguel,"This isn't fair, it's my life!     You already had yours!"
miguel,"Pap Julio, I ask for your blessing."
mam imelda,"Don't make this hard, mijo.      You go home my way, or no way."
miguel,You really hate music that much?
mam imelda,I will not let you go down the same path he did.
miguel,The same path he did.
ta victoria,Listen to your Mam Imelda.
to oscar,She's just looking out for you.
ta rosita,Be reasonable.
miguel,"Con permiso, I... need to visit the restroom. Be right back!"
clerk,"Uh, should we tell him there are no restrooms in the Land of the Dead?"
miguel,Vmonos.
patrolwoman,We got a family looking for a LIVING BOY.
miguel,"If I wanna be a musician, I need a MUSICIAN'S blessing. We gotta find my great-great grandpa."
patrolman,"Hold it, muchacho."
patrolman,Ahh!
patrolman,I've found that living boy!
patrolman,"Uh whoa, excuse me, excuse me folks! Excuse me--"
miguel,"No, no -- Dante!"
corrections officer,"...disturbing the peace, fleeing an officer, falsifying a unibrow..."
hctor,That's illegal?
corrections officer,"VERY illegal. You need to clean up your act, amigo."
hctor,"Amigo?  I've just had a really hard Da de Muertos, and I could really use an amigo right now."
corrections officer,Uh--
hctor,"I'll -- I'll get you backstage, you can meet him!  You just gotta let me cross that bridge!"
corrections officer,"I should lock you up for the rest of the holiday...  But my shift's almost up, and I wanna visit my living family... so I'm letting you off with a warning."
hctor,Can I at least get my costume back?
corrections officer,"Uh, no."
hctor,Some amigo...
miguel,Hey. Hey!     You really know de la Cruz?
hctor,Who wants to--  Ah! You're alive!
miguel,Shhh!
hctor,That's weirdly specific.
miguel,He's my great-great-grandfather.
hctor,He's your wha-whaat...?
miguel,"D'ya know what, maybe this isn't such a g--"
hctor,"No, nio, nio, nio, I can help you! You can help me. We can help each other! But most importantly, you can help ME."
mam imelda,Miguel!
miguel,AH!
hctor,I'm Hctor.
miguel,That's nice!
hctor,Esprame chamaco!
mam imelda,"Ay, he is going to get himself killed... I need my spirit guide, Pepita."
mam imelda,Who has that petal Miguel touched?
pap julio,Here!
pap julio,Nice alebrije...
hctor,"Hey, hey, hold still.  Look up. Look up. A ver, a ver... look up. Up, UP!... Ta-da!"
miguel,You don't get to cross over.
hctor,No one's ever put up my picture...  But you can change that!
miguel,This is you?
hctor,"Muy guapo, eh?"
miguel,"So you get me to my great-great grandpa, then I put up your photo when I get home?"
hctor,"Such a smart boy! Yes! Great idea, yes!  So, you got any other family here, you know? Someone a bit more... accessible?"
miguel,"Mmm, nope."
hctor,"Don't yank my chain, chamaco.      You gotta have SOME other family."
miguel,"ONLY de la Cruz. If you can't help me, I'll find him myself."
hctor,"Okay, okay, kid, fine -- fine! I'll get you to your great-great grandpa...!"
miguel,I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in.
hctor,"No, skeletons don't walk like that."
miguel,It's how you walk.
hctor,"No, I don't."
miguel,"Whoa...""Ernesto de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular...!"" Qu padre!"
hctor,"Blech. Every year, your great- great grandpa puts on that dumb show to mark the end of Da de Muertos."
miguel,And you can get us in!
hctor,Ahhhh--
miguel,"Hey, you said you had front row tickets!"
hctor,That... that was a lie.      I apologize for that.
hctor,"Cool off, chamaco, come on... I'll get you to him."
miguel,How?
hctor,'Cause I happen to know where he's rehearsing!
cecilia,"You better have my dress, Hctor!"
hctor,"Hola, Ceci!"
miguel,Hola.
hctor,"Ceci, I lost the dress--"
cecilia,"Ya lo saba! I gotta dress forty dancers by sunrise and thanks to you, I'm one Frida short of an opening number!"
hctor,"Ceci -- I know, Ceci. I know, I know. Ceci -- Ceci... Ceci. Ceci..."
miguel,Dante... Dante!
miguel,We shouldn't be in here...
miguel,"No, no, Dante! Ven ac!"
frida,You!    How did you get in here?
miguel,I just followed my--
frida,"Oh, the mighty Xolo dog...! Guider of wandering spirits...!  And whose spirit have you guided to me?"
miguel,I don't think he's a spirit guide.
frida,Ah-ah-ah. The alebrijes of this world can take many forms... They are as mysterious as they are powerful...
frida,You are the audience.  Darkness. And from the darkness... A giant PAPAYA!
frida,Dancers emerge from the papaya and the dancers are all me!
miguel,"I think it's just the right amount of obvious?  It could use some music... Oh! What if you did, like, doonk-doonk- doonk-doonk..."
frida,And... what if everything was on fire? Yes! Fire everywhere!
frida,Inspired!  You... you have the spirit of an artist!
frida,"The dancers exit, the music fades, the lights go out! And Ernesto de la Cruz rises to the stage!"
miguel,Huh?
frida,"He does a couple of songs, the sun rises, everyone cheers--"
miguel,"Excuse me, where's the real de la Cruz?"
frida,Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals. He's too busy hosting that fancy party at the top of his tower.
hctor,"Chamaco! You can't run off on me like that! C'mon, stop pestering the celebrities..."
miguel,"You said my great-great grandpa would be here! He's halfway across town, throwing some big party."
hctor,That bum! Who doesn't show up to his own rehearsal?
miguel,"If you're such good friends, how come he didn't invite you?"
hctor,He's YOUR great-great grandpa.   How come he didn't invite YOU?
hctor,Hey Gustavo! You know anything about this party?
gustavo,"It's the hot ticket. But if you're not on the guest list you're never getting in, Chorizo..."
musicians,"Hey, it's Chorizo! / Choricito!"
hctor,"Ha ha, very funny guys.      Very funny."
miguel,Chorizo?
gustavo," Oh, this guy's famous! Go on, go on, ask him how he died!"
hctor,I don't want to talk about it.
gustavo,He choked on some CHORIZO!
hctor,"I didn't choke, okay -- I got food poisoning, which is a big difference!"
hctor, This is why I don't like musicians... bunch of self- important jerks!
miguel,"Hey, I'm a musician."
hctor,You are?
gustavo,"Well, if you really want to get to Ernesto, there IS that music competition at the Plaza de la Cruz. Winner gets to play at his party..."
hctor,"No, no, no, chamaco, you are loco if you think--"
miguel,I need to get my great-great grandfather's blessing.
hctor,I know a guy...
mam imelda,"Have you found him, Pepita?      Have you found our boy?"
ta rosita,A footprint!
pap julio,It's a Rivera boot!
to oscar,Size seven...
to felipe,...and a half.
ta victoria,Pronated.
mam imelda,Miguel.
hctor,Why the heck would you wanna be a musician?
miguel,My great-great grandpa was a musician.
hctor,"...Who spent his life performing like a monkey for complete strangers. Blech, no, no thank you, gucala, no..."
miguel,Whadda you know?
miguel,"So, how far is this guitar anyway?"
hctor,We're almost there...
ratty group,COUSIN HCTOR!!
hctor,Eh!   These guys!
ratty member,HCTOR!!
hctor,Hey To!   Qu onda!
miguel,These people are all your family?
hctor,"Eh, in a way... We're all the ones with no photos or ofrendas, no family to go home to. Nearly forgotten, you know?  So, we all call each other cousin, or to, or whatever."
ta chelo,Hctor!
hctor,Ta Chelo!     He-hey!
old tias,Muchas gracias!
hctor,"Hey, hey! Save some for me!      Is Chicharrn around?"
ta chelo,In the bungalow. I don't know if he's in the mood for visitors...
hctor,Who doesn't like a visit from Cousin Hctor?
hctor,"Buenas noches, Chicharrn!"
chicharrn,"I don't want to see your stupid face, Hctor."
hctor,"C'mon, it's Da de Muertos! I brought you a little offering!"
chicharrn,Get out of here...
hctor,"I would, Cheech, but the thing is... me and my friend, Miguel, we really need to borrow your guitar."
chicharrn,My guitar?!
hctor,Yes?
chicharrn,"My prized, beloved guitar...?"
hctor,I promise we'll bring it right back.
chicharrn,Like the time you promised to bring back my van?
hctor,Uh...
chicharrn,Or my mini-fridge?
hctor,"Ah, you see-"
chicharrn,Or my good napkins? My lasso?    My femur?!
hctor,"No, no, not like those times."
chicharrn,Where's my femur?! You--
hctor,"Whoa, whoa -- you okay, amigo?"
chicharrn,"I'm fading, Hctor. I can feel it.  You play me something."
hctor,"You know I don't play anymore, Cheech. The guitar's for the kid--"
chicharrn,"You want it, you got to earn it..."
hctor,"Only for you, amigo.     Any requests?"
chicharrn,"You know my favorite, Hctor."
hctor," WELL EVERYONE KNOWS JUANITA, HER EYES EACH A DIFFERENT COLOR. HER TEETH STICK OUT, AND HER CHIN GOES IN, AND HER..."
chicharrn,Those aren't the words!
hctor,"There are children present.  HER HAIR IS LIKE A BRIAR, SHE STANDS IN A BOW-LEGGED STANCE. AND IF I WEREN'T SO UGLY, SHE'D POSSIBLY GIVE ME A CHANCE!"
chicharrn,Brings back memories.     Gracias...
miguel,Wait... what happened?
hctor,"He's been forgotten.  When there's no one left in the living world who remembers you, you disappear from this world. We call it the ""Final Death."""
miguel,Where did he go?
hctor,No one knows.
miguel,"But I've met him... I could remember him, when I go back..."
hctor,"No, it doesn't work like that, chamaco. Our memories... they have to be passed down by those who knew us in life -- in the stories they tell about us. But there's no one left alive to pass down Cheech's stories..."
miguel,"You told me you hated musicians, you never said you were one."
hctor,How do you think I knew your great- great grandpa? We used to play music together. Taught him everything he knows.
miguel,"No manches! You played with Ernesto de la Cruz, the greatest musician of all time?"
hctor,"Ha-ha, you're funny! Greatest eyebrows of all time maybe but his music, eh, not so much."
miguel,You don't know what you're talking about...
hctor,"Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz!  Showtime, chamaco!"
vendor,Llvelo!   T-shirts!    Bobble-heads!
emcee,Bienvenidos a todos!     Who's ready for some msica?
hctor,"That's our ticket, muchacho."
emcee,Let the competition begin!
hctor,So what's the plan?     What are you gonna play?
miguel,"Definitely ""Remember Me."""
hctor,"No, not that one.     No."
miguel,"C'mon, it's his most popular song!"
hctor,"Ehck, it's too popular."
skeleton musician," REMEMBER ME, THOUGH I HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR, REMEMBER ME..."
opera singers, REMEMBER ME! DON'T LET IT MAKE YOU CRY!
miguel,"Um... what about ""Poco Loco?"""
hctor,Epa!   Now that's a song!
stagehand,"De la Cruzcito? You're on standby!  Los Chachalacos, you're up next!"
crowd,LOS CHACHALACOS!
hctor,You always this nervous before a performance?
miguel,I don't know -- I've never performed before.
hctor,What?! You said you were a musician!
miguel,I am!  I mean I will be.     Once I win.
hctor,"That's your plan?!  No, no, no, no, no, you have to win, Miguel. Your life LITERALLY depends on you winning! AND YOU'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE?!"
miguel,No!    I need to do this.
hctor,Why?
miguel,If I can't go out there and play one song... how can I call myself a musician?
hctor,What does that matter?!
miguel,'Cuz I don't just want to get de la Cruz's blessing. I need to prove that... that I'm worthy of it.
hctor,"Oh. Oh, that's such a sweet sentiment... at SUCH a bad time!"
hctor,"Okay... okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay.  Okay you wanna perform? Then you've got to PERFORM!"
miguel,My best grito?
hctor,"Come on, yell! Belt it out! OOOOOOH HE-HE-HEY! Ha! Ah, feels good! Okay... now you."

miguel,Hctor...
hctor,"Make 'em listen, chamaco!        You got this!"
hctor,Arre pap!     Hey!
on stage," Miguel slowly takes the stage, guitar in hand.         He's blinded by the lights and squints out at the audience.         He's frozen stiff."
hctor, What's he doing? Why isn't he playing?
on stage," Panic is painted across Miguel's face.  AUDIENCE MEMBER  Bring back the singing dogs!  The crowd begins to murmur impatiently.         Miguel looks to Hctor in the wing.  Hctor makes eye contact with Miguel and does the ""loosen up"" bone shimmy."
miguel,HAAAAAAAI-YAAAAAAAAAAAI-YAAAAAAAAI!
miguel," WHAT COLOR IS THE SKY? AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR YOU TELL ME THAT IT'S RED AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR WHERE SHOULD I PUT MY SHOES? AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR YOU SAY PUT THEM ON YOUR HEAD AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR"
hctor,"No, no, no, no..."

audience,Otra!   Otra! Otra!
hctor,"Hey, where are you going?"
miguel,We gotta get outta here.
hctor,"What, are you crazy?     We're about to win this thing!"
emcee,"Damas y caballeros, I have an emergency announcement.  Please be on the lookout for a living boy, answers to the name of Miguel. Earlier tonight he ran away from his family. They just want to send him back to the Land of the Living..."
hctor,"Wait, wait, wait! You said de la Cruz was your ONLY family. The ONLY person who could send you home."
miguel,"I do have other family, but--"
hctor,You could have taken my photo back this whole time?!
miguel,--But they hate music!      I need a musician's blessing!
hctor,You lied to me!
miguel,"Oh, you're one to talk!"
hctor,"Look at me. I'm being forgotten, Miguel. I don't even know if I'm gonna last the night!  I'm not gonna miss my one chance to cross that bridge 'cause you want to live out some stupid musical fantasy!"
miguel,It's not stupid.
hctor,I'm taking you to your family.
miguel,Let go of me!
hctor,You'll thank me later--
miguel,"You don't wanna help me, you only care about yourself! Keep your dumb photo!"
hctor,"No -- no, no, no!     No..."
miguel,Stay away from me!
hctor,"Hey, chamaco! Where did you go?! Chamaco! I'm sorry! Come back!"
miguel,"Dante, cllate!"
crowd members,It's him! / It's that living boy! / I heard about him. / Look! / He's alive! / The boy's alive.
miguel,AAHH!
mam imelda,"This nonsense ends now, Miguel! I am giving you my blessing and you are going home!"
miguel,I don't want your blessing!
mam imelda,Miguel!   Stop!
miguel,You're ruining my life!
mam imelda,What?
miguel,"Music's the only thing that makes me happy. And you, you wanna take that away!  You'll never understand."
mam imelda," Y AUNQUE LA VIDA ME CUESTE, LLORONA... NO DEJAR DE QUERERTE..."
miguel,I thought you hated music.
mam imelda,"Oh, I loved it.  I remember that feeling, when my husband would play, and I would sing and nothing else mattered. But when we had Coco, suddenly... there was something in my life that mattered more than music. I wanted to put down roots. He wanted to play for the world."
miguel,But I don't wanna... pick sides!  But you never will.
security guard,Have a good time.
guest,"Oh, how exciting!"
security guard,Oh!  El Santo!  I'm a big fan.
security guard,You mind if I--
security guard,"Gracias, seor!"

miguel,"Pardon me, Seor de la Cruz!     Seor de la--"
miguel,Seor de la Cruz!     Seor de la--
miguel," SEORAS Y SEORES BUENAS TARDES, BUENAS NOCHES BUENAS TARDES, BUENAS NOCHES SEORITAS Y SEORES TO BE HERE WITH YOU TONIGHT BRINGS ME JOY! QU ALEGRA! FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANGUAGE AND THE WORLD ES MI FAMILIA"

miguel,FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANG--
miguel,You... know about me?
miguel,I'm Miguel. Your great-great grandson.
miguel,"I need your blessing. So I can go back home and be a musician, just like you. "
86.," MIGUEL  The rest of our family, they wouldn't listen. But I... I hoped you would?  DE LA CRUZ My boy, with a talent like yours, how could I not listen?  Miguel hugs de la Cruz who sweeps Miguel up onto his shoulders, showing him off to the room.  DE LA CRUZ I HAVE A GREAT-GREAT GRANDSON!  The crowd roars.  CUT TO:"
crowd,"Look, it's Frida!"
hctor,"Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo."
security guard,"It is an honor, seora!"
hctor,Gracias...
miguel,Dimple.   No dimple.      Dimple.   No dimple.
miguel,No -- it's all great.
miguel,It's just -- I've been looking up to you my whole life. You're the guy who actually did it! But...  Did you ever regret it? Choosing music over... everything else.
miguel,Leaving your family?
miguel,You mean it?!
miguel,I can't... I have to get home before sunrise.
hctor,"You said you'd take back my photo. You promised, Miguel."
miguel,I just met him tonight.      He told me he knew you--
hctor,"Please Miguel, put my photo up."
hctor,And whose fault is that?
hctor,Those were MY songs you took.     MY songs that made YOU famous.
miguel,W-What?
hctor,"If I'm being forgotten, it's because you never told anyone that I wrote them--"
miguel,"That's crazy, de la Cruz wrote all his own songs."
hctor," You wanna tell him, or should I?"
hctor,"Oh, how generous."
miguel,You really did play together...
hctor,"Look, I don't want to fight about it. I just want you to make it right. Miguel can put my photo up--"
hctor,--And I can cross over the bridge. I can see my girl.
hctor,Ernesto... Remember the night I left?
hctor,"We drank together and you told me you would move heaven and earth for your amigo. Well, I'm asking you to now."
miguel,Heaven and earth?     Like in the movie?
hctor,What?
miguel,"That's Don Hidalgo's toast... in the de la Cruz movie, ""El Camino A Casa."""
hctor,"I'm talking about my real life, Miguel."
miguel,"No, it's in there.    Look."
miguel,"But in the movie, Don Hidalgo poisons the drink..."
hctor,"That night, Ernesto.    The night I left..."
young hctor,This was your dream. You'll manage.
young hctor,"I'm going home, Ernesto.  Hate me if you want, but my mind is made up."
hctor,You... POISONED me.
hctor,All this time I thought it was just bad luck.
hctor,I never thought that you might have... that you...
hctor,How could you?!
miguel,Hctor!
hctor,You took everything away from me!
hctor,You rat!
hctor,"I just wanted to go back home!      No, no, NO!"
miguel,You were going to give me your blessing...
miguel,That you murdered Hctor... for his songs?
miguel,I -- no! Everyone knows you're the... the good guy.
miguel,Pap Ernesto? My blessing?
miguel,What?!    But I'm your family!
miguel,"No, NO!"
miguel,Let go!
miguel,NO!   AHHHHHH!
miguel,Help! Can anyone hear me?        I wanna go home!
miguel,Hctor?
hctor,Kid?
miguel,"Oh, Hctor!"
miguel,You were right. I should have gone back to my family--
hctor,"Hey -- hey, hey..."
miguel,"They told me not to be like de la Cruz, but I didn't listen--"
hctor,"Hey, it's okay..."
miguel,I told them I didn't care if they remembered me. I didn't care if I was on their stupid ofrenda.
hctor,"Hey, chamaco, it's okay.         It's okay."
miguel,I told them I didn't care.
hctor,Hhuuh!
miguel,Hctor!   Hctor--
hctor,She's... forgetting me.
miguel,Who?
hctor,My daughter...
miguel,She's the reason you wanted to cross the bridge...
hctor,I just wanted to see her again...  My Coco...
miguel,Coco?
hctor,Where... where did you get this?
miguel,That's my Mam Coco. That's my Mam Imelda. Is that... you?
hctor,We're...
hctor,I always hoped I'd see her again. That she'd miss me... maybe put up my photo. But it never happened.  But she's the last person who remembers me. The moment she's gone from the living world...
miguel,You disappear... from this one. You'll never get to see her...
hctor,...Ever again.
hctor,"You know, I wrote her a song once. We used to sing it every night at the same time, no matter how far apart we were. What I wouldn't give to sing it to her... one last time."
hctor, REMEMBER ME THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE REMEMBER ME DON'T LET IT MAKE YOU CRY FOR EVEN IF I'M FAR AWAY I HOLD YOU IN MY HEART I SING A SECRET SONG TO YOU EACH NIGHT WE ARE APART REMEMBER ME
young coco, Pap!
hctor, THOUGH I HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR REMEMBER ME EACH TIME YOU HEAR A SAD GUITAR
miguel,He stole your guitar... He stole your songs... 
hctor,"I didn't write ""Remember Me"" for the world... I wrote it for Coco. I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a great-great grandpa."
miguel,Are you kidding? A minute ago I thought I was related to a murderer. You're a total upgrade!
miguel,"My whole life, there's been something that made me different... and I never knew where it came from.  I'm proud we're family!"
hctor,TRRRRRRAAAAAI-HAAAI-HAAAAAY! I'm proud to be HIS family!
miguel,Dante?
miguel,Dante!    It's Dante!
hctor,Imelda!
mam imelda, Hctor.
hctor,You look good...
miguel,"Dante, you knew he was my Pap Hctor the whole time! You ARE a real spirit guide!  Who's a good spirit guide? You are!"
miguel,Whoa...
miguel,Dante!
pap julio,"Look, there they are!"
family,"Miguel! / Miguelito! / Ay, gracias a Dios! / It's Miguel! / He's all right! / Oh thank goodness! / Gracias, Dios mo!"
mam imelda,"Mijo, I was so worried! Thank goodness we found you in time!"
mam imelda,And you! How many times must I turn you away?
hctor,Imelda--
mam imelda,"I want nothing to do with you. Not in life, not in death!  I spent decades protecting my family from your mistakes. He spends five minutes with you and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole!"
miguel,"I wasn't in there `cause of Hctor. He was in there `cause of me.  He was just trying to get me home... I didn't wanna listen, but he was right... nothing is more important than family."
mam imelda,What?
miguel,So he can see Coco again.        Hctor should be on our ofrenda.        He's part of our family--
mam imelda,He left this family!
miguel,He tried to go home to you and Coco... but de la Cruz murdered him!
hctor,"It's true, Imelda."
mam imelda,And so what if it's true? You leave me alone with a child to raise and I'm just supposed to forgive you?
hctor,"Imelda, I--"
miguel,Hctor?
hctor,I'm running out of time.         It's Coco...
mam imelda,She's forgetting you...
miguel,You don't have to forgive him... But we shouldn't forget him.
mam imelda," I wanted to forget you. I wanted Coco to forget you too, but--"
hctor,"This is my fault, not yours.  I'm sorry, Imelda."
mam imelda,"Miguel, if we help you get his photo... you will return home?          No more music?"
miguel,Family comes first.
mam imelda,I -- I can't forgive you.        But I will help you.
mam imelda, So how do we get to de la Cruz?
miguel,I might know a way...
on stage," Frida's performance piece begins. Dramatic symphonic music plays as a giant papaya appears to ignite on stage. The ""seeds"" in the body of the papaya unfurl to reveal that they are dancers, each dressed like Frida Kahlo, right down to the painted on unibrow.  The dancers roll out of the ""flaming"" papaya and gyrate their bodies nonsensically.  A giant cactus that resembles Frida is illuminated, and all the dancers slink to it.  In the midst of this, eight familiar looking dancers  inch their way out of the spotlights and to the wings of the stage."
frida,"Good luck, muchacho."
miguel,Gracias Frida!
miguel,Ow!
hctor,"Here, let me help you with--"
mam imelda,Don't touch me.
miguel,Everyone clear on the plan?

mam imelda,"Now, we just have to find de la Cruz--"
mam imelda,Ah!
mam imelda,That's for murdering the love of my life!
hctor,She's talking about me!  I'm the love of your life?
mam imelda,I don't know! I'm still angry at you.
mam imelda,And that's for trying to murder my grandson!
miguel,She's talking about me!
miguel,The photo!
mam imelda,After him!
hctor,"You said ""love of your life..."""
mam imelda,I don't know WHAT I said!
