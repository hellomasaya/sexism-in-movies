Speaker,Dialogue
girard,And god have mercy on whomever you meet next.
mother,"Sit. D'Artagnan sighs, sits in a large wooden chair. A beat. His mother speaks quietly, eyes turned back to the open chest. MOTHER Your father was a proud man. And he had a right to be. I never knew one as brave or as kind. He knew that his strength was a gift to be given in the service of honor. That is why he dedicated his life to his country and his King. That is why he gave his life, for both."
mother,It's time for you find your fortune with men as brave and as bold as you are. In Paris. With the King's Musketeers.  You'll need this.
mother,"Yes, son.   And now to you. With that, she holds out the beautiful saber.         D'Artagnan takes it firmly into his hands."
mother,Never submit to insults.    Except from the King.
mother,You've heard that every man in the Musketeers is on the run from someone or something? D'ARTAGNAN Yes.   But what am I running from?
mogher," A shrew of a mother, and a drafty old house. Now go."
rochefort,"Musketeers... A hundred faces turn   upward to regard him. And on each the same expression   -- absolute loathing for the man in black. Rochefort is    not intimidated by this sea of con- tempt. He revels in    it. ROCHEFORT By joint edict of His Majesty King Louis XIII and His Eminence Cardinal Richelieu, the Musketeers are officially disbanded. In preparation for the coming war with England, your ranks and commissions are hereby transferred to the Infantry. You will be contacted and told where to report. Until that time, you are instructed to return to your homes. DE TREVILLE  And who will protect the King? ROCHEFORT The Cardinal's Guards are more than capable of assuming that... responsibility."
rochefort,"You are hereby ordered to disperse. Should even one of you resist... the entire corps will be arrested and imprisoned.  'All for one, and one for all.'"
de treville,Go to your homes. Wait. Our day will come again.
rochefort, All but... three.
richelieu,Three?
jussac, What is this?
athos,A private party. Go away. ARAMIS Athos -- is that any way to greet our guests?
jussac,Your presence is requested at Musketeer Headquarters by Captain Rochefort. Athos and Aramis exchange looks.
athos,The Cyclops is a Captain? He must've made a pact with the Devil.
aramis,Or the Cardinal. ATHOS What's the difference?
jussac,You're instructed to come with me and surrender your tunics.
athos,These gentlemen made a similar request. JUSSAC Are you refusing to come peaceably? ATHOS Probably. But I'll leave it up to my companions. Aramis? ARAMIS We can't refuse Rochefort's invitation. It would be impolite. Athos tips back in his chair and gazes upward.
athos,"And what do you say, Porthos?"
porthos,"I'll be right down! With the grace of an aerialist, Porthos jumps from the balcony and lands atop the chandelier. His weight causes the chains suspending it to break. With a whoop of pleasure, Porthos rides the chandelier down as it lands squarely atop Jussac's Guards, squashing them."
constance,These 'bandits' are the Queen's own bodyguards.
constance,"You're a very foolish boy, d'Artagnan... but a very handsome one. Good-bye. Constance spurs her horse and rides off to catch up with Anne. D'ARTAGNAN  Wait!   You didn't tell me your name! But Constance is gone. D'Artagnan stands in the middle of the road, feeling foolish and oddly thrilled at the same time. The two bodyguards groan and grumble."
rochefort,"I'll take those tunics, Musketeers. PORTHOS  What did he say? ARAMIS He said he'll take those tunics. PORTHOS Tunics?   Coming right up. Porthos reaches inside his cloak and takes out a crumpled red tunic he took from one of the Cardinal's guards. He drops it on the ground, digs into a pocket and takes out another. He finds another in his boot and another up his sleeve. There's one in his hat. Like a magician, he keeps pulling red tunics out of the most bizarre places."
athos,I was trying to remember the last time I saw you here. I know. It was the day you were kicked out of the Musketeers.
aramis,Conduct Unbecoming a Musketeer. Wasn't that the charge?
rochefort,You ought to know. Three witnesses stood against me.
athos,"And if we refuse? ROCHEFORT You will become outlaws.   Hunted men. PORTHOS It doesn't matter where I go or what I do. Sooner or later somebody's calling me 'outlaw.' Athos cuts him off with a look. He's familiar with Porthos' propensity for tall tales. But not here, not now. Athos turns back to the balcony. Rochefort lobs a taunt. ROCHEFORT Are you refusing to serve your King? ARAMIS We are refusing to serve the Cardinal. PORTHOS Same thing, these days. ARAMIS France has one King too many."
rochefort,I'll tell him you said that.
athos,"Do that, Rochefort. Tell his Emminence the Cardinal that we will continue to perform our sworn duty to protect the King. From enemies across the sea. "
rochefort,I'll make sure His Emminence the Cardinal gets the message. But I can't promise he'll be pleased.
aramis,Are you going to visit them alphabetically or in order of preference?
porthos,"Alphabetically seems... fair. ARAMIS When it comes to you and women, fairness rarely applies. ATHOS  To celebrate. And to plan our new lives. PORTHOS Outlaws."
aramis,Citizens of France.
athos,The three Musketeers. And that is all that remains.
athos, Not as far as I'm concerned.
athos,I mean the Musketeers have been disbanded. Feel free to poke around for souvenirs.
athos,"Some nonsense about being needed in the army. Now if you'll excuse me... D'Artagnan blocks Athos' path. D'ARTAGNAN But I just got here. How can I become a Musketeer if they've been disbanded? ATHOS I'd say you've got a problem. D'Artagnan grabs Athos by his injured arm. Athos, stif- ling pain, fixes d'Artagnan with a deadly look. ATHOS You could use a lesson in manners. D'Artagnan touches his sword, eyes flashing at the pos- sibility of a duel. D'ARTAGNAN Any time."
athos,I'm in a hurry now -- but I'll meet you at the Carmes-Deshaux monastery at noon.
porthos," I rode through a puddle, muddied your sash, the Queen of America except there isn't one, I'm in a hurry, and you were about to challenge me to a duel."
porthos, I was?
cardinal's guard,The young women do not wish to be spoken to. D'ARTAGNAN I have something that belongs to the Queen. GUARD  What? D'ARTAGNAN A bracelet. GUARD I'll deliver it for you.
aramis,"Madam, I'm flattered but I thought you wanted me to tutor you in theology."
aramis,"There's nothing unholy about expressing one's emotions. On the contrary. Religion should be experienced in a passionate, all- embracing way. We should feel free to express our spirituality."
damsel,"Yes, darling! The Damsel attacks him again.         Suddenly, a pounding on the door. MAN  Open up!"
damsel, My husband! ARAMIS Your husband!? DAMSEL Aramis -- run!
aramis,First we must pray to God for forgiveness.
aramis,"On second thought, God's often busy. Aramis leaps to his feet and sprints for the open window."
aramis,"If there's one thing I can't abide, it's rudeness. D'ARTAGNAN You fell on me! ARAMIS And I apologized for it. D'ARTAGNAN I suppose you'd like to teach me a lesson in manners, too. ARAMIS I'd be honored. D'Artagnan brightens.   Another duel! D'ARTAGNAN How's two o'clock behind the Luxembourg? Aramis bows politely."
aramis,"If that's where you wish to die, I won't disappoint you. Until then..."
richelieu,How was your ride?
anne,"My ride...?    Well, I... I'm not sure... RICHELIEU "
anne,"Thank you. Richelieu turns to the great map, speaks gently."
richelieu,"You're homesick. ANNE  Lonely. Is that the same thing? RICHELIEU Sometimes. Richelieu brings his eyes back to Anne, continues: RICHELIEU Austria's loss is France's gain. ANNE I'm not sure my new husband shares your opinion. RICHELIEU Nonsense.    He's young, not blind."
anne,"Mostly, he is absent. I've barely seen His Majesty since our wedding, and that was three months ago. Whenever he's around me, he has nothing to say."
richelieu,Arranged marriages can be difficult. Your father and I thought yours would bring Austria and France closer together.
richelieu,"Louis was only nine years old when his father was assassinated. He lost his childhood forever that day. I have watched him grow toward manhood, seen the toll his life demands. A boy who is not allowed to be a boy sometimes has difficulty becoming a man. He is shy, yet boastful. Giving, yet stubborn. But most of all, he is not yet sure exactly who he is. The boy who lost his father. Or the King of France. ANNE But how can I...?"
richelieu,Flatter him. Make the boy feel like a King. So that the King may be your husband.
seneschal,"His Majesty, the King."
richelieu,"Your Majesty. LOUIS Cardinal Richelieu, I've been looking for you."
louis,Oh. Anne. Hello. I didn't know you were here.
anne,Would you like me to go? Louis suddenly remembers the reason he's here.       Determin- ation breeds a more capable attitude.
louis,"No.  Please, stay.  Your Eminence, I demand an answer."
richelieu," Perhaps if I knew the question... LOUIS I've just been told that you went ahead and disbanded my Musketeers. RICHELIEU You approved the decision. LOUIS But not the timing of the matter. I intended to address them myself, explain the situation... RICHELIEU Your Majesty, France is on the brink of war. We dare not hesitate."
louis,But these men are my personal guards... RICHELIEU They are the bravest fighters in France. 
louis,"I will be the judge of what is best. For me, and for France."
richelieu,"Of course.   Forgive me. A tense beat.    Anne, feeling out of place, steps toward the door. LOUIS Anne?   Are you all right? ANNE You two should continue this discussion in private. LOUIS  Your thoughts on the matter interest me. They might... help."
anne,It seems to me that... you're doing very well on your own.
richelieu,Extremely. LOUIS Intelligent.
richelieu,Very.
richelieu,She scares me too. As do all women who join beauty to intelligence. What's a man to do?
louis," I have no idea. RICHELIEU The course of love is full of frightful turns. But, no matter how you feel, no matter how hopelessly afraid... never let her know that you are anything other than the bravest and most confident man in France. Make that your starting point, and everything else will fall... into place."
louis,The bravest man in France...
richelieu,Good advice for a shopkeeper. Let alone a King.
richelieu,I know.   But don't worry. 
milady,Count de Winter.
milady, I will kill you with my bare hands.
milady,"Well if that's the case, I'd better start packing. But first, my hair... Milady, who has been removing combs throughout, reaches for the next, and..."
armand,Father?
athos,"I asked two of my friends to act as seconds, but they are not as punctual."
athos,Don't worry. I fight just as well with my left hand. 
porthos, What're you doing? You can't fight this man.
athos,"Why not? PORTHOS Because I'm fighting him. D'ARTAGNAN Excuse me, monsieur. But not until one o'clock. ARAMIS  How long have you been in Paris? D'ARTAGNAN I arrived this morning."
athos,You've been... busy.
aramis,"Jussac.   Again. Athos steps forward to meet him. ATHOS I told you the next time we met I'd want an answer. But I didn't expect you so soon. JUSSAC The three of you are under arrest. The boy's of no interest to me and is free to go. Do you intend to resist? PORTHOS Oh, don't be stupid. Of course we intend to resist. Just give us a second."
porthos,Bold and brave.
aramis,"A poet. ATHOS Have you got a name, boy? D'ARTAGNAN D'Artagnan."
porthos," D'Artagnan? The name has meaning for all of them. The Musketeers look at each other, deadpan, shake their heads. ARAMIS Impossible."
porthos,It couldn't be.
athos,"Athos... Porthos... Aramis. D'ARTAGNAN Pleased to meet you... How do you do?... Good to see you again... Meanwhile, Jussac and his Guards look on with increasing impatience. He clears his throat, draws his saber. The Musketeers turn toward the Guards, d'Artagnan standing among them. "
porthos, Damn monks. Always spoiling everybody's fun.
porthos,"They're about to get a little nearer to the hilt of my sword. ARAMIS Pagan. PORTHOS Papist. Porthos slides over to handle one of Aramis' opponents. He'd rather bicker from close range. But Biscarat struggles to his feet, grabs his saber. Porthos sees him, sighs. PORTHOS  Excuse me? ARAMIS I'm fine, thank you."
athos,You mean he's still alive?
biscarat,Now what...?
athos,Last rites. Aramis takes death very seriously.
porthos, Do you know where this bolo comes from?
porthos,Spain.
aramis,"Don't encourage him. By killing Jussac, the boy's made himself an outlaw too."
athos,Not if he leaves Paris. Which is exactly what he's going to do.
porthos,"Go home, find a wench, live long and prosper. D'ARTAGNAN Why can't I stay with you? Aramis and Porthos look to Athos.      As always, he will decide. ATHOS Because I do not want you to. It's hard to say whether he's acting out of concern for the boy... or he simply doesn't give a damn. Whatever the case, d'Artagnan is crestfallen. The Musketeers mount their horses, Porthos and Aramis adopt a friendlier tone."
aramis,"I know Athos may seem cold and unfriendly, but don't let that fool you. PORTHOS He really is cold and unfriendly."
aramis,"But he's also right. This is our fight, not yours. Go on, get out of here."
athos,"Wake up, boy.    The Musketeers are just a dream. "
rochefort, There they go! After them!
at distance,"The three Muskeeters rein their horses, look back to d'Artagnan's bold charge. PORTHOS  Do you believe this kid."
rochefort, Fall back! I'll take him myself!
porthos,Rochefort's got the boy.
athos," Too bad. ARAMIS You can't just leave him. Athos spurs his horse, rides away. Aramis and Porthos exchange sad looks and hopeful comments."
aramis,"He has a plan. PORTHOS Definitely.   A plan. And with that, they gallop after."
rochefort,I'll give you a hint. It's not the Louvre.
rochefort,"Well, you're the first person who was ever happy to be here. Unfortunately, your visit will be a short one."
rochefort,Also punishable by death. D'ARTAGNAN It was a long day. ROCHEFORT You know them?
rochefort,The Musketeers. D'Artagnan says nothing.     He will not betray them. Rochefort leans close.
rochefort,"Tell me where they are, and I will be lenient."
richelieu,Carry this to the Duke of Buckingham.
richelieu,"And doing so, shall earn you the gratitude of... a King."
rochefort,"This is the boy who killed Jussac. D'ARTAGNAN I can explain that -- ROCHEFORT Silence! Rochefort punches d'Artagnan in the head, knocking him to the floor. The Cardinal frowns."
richelieu,"Rochefort. Violence solves nothing. Leave him to me. D'Artagnan reacts to the Cardinal's reasonable tone. Rochefort makes a sullen exit. The Cardinal smiles. RICHELIEU Please.    Sit down. D'Artagnan reacts with perceptible awe, as if seeing his first movie star. He sits in a finely brocaded chair, looks at the Cardinal, an apparition in red. The Cardinal speaks, his manner casual, friendly. RICHELIEU How much did you hear?"
richelieu,"You may have many talents, my young friend. But guile is not one of them. Do you have a name?"
richelieu,I've heard that name before.   Are you a Gascon?
richelieu,"In that case, give my regards to the headsman. D'ARTAGNAN What about my trial? RICHELIEU You've just had it."
richelieu,"Then tell me what I want to know, and perhaps you will keep it there a few years longer. "
richelieu,And if you did?
rochefort,Milady left at midnight.   By private coach. RICHELIEU A remarkable woman. The most beautiful I've ever known. And the deadliest. Which would explain my attraction.  How is our young daredevil holding up?
rochefort,"He's wishing he'd never heard of the Musketeers. Down below, the horse cart reaches the scaffold. A man- at-arms drops the tailgate, d'Artagnan steps down. He is taken into the custody of a CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS, and several men-at-arms carrying muskets."
priest,"For we are with you, always. The Priest raises his face, reveals it... and winks.         It is Aramis. He whispers: ARAMIS All for one, and one for all..."
aramis,The good father is... all tied up.
constance,Men call it justice.
anne,"Are you surprised? She replies   with contempt, reins her horse away from the square, the   crowd, the executioner's axe. But Constance freezes in   place, eyes wide. As d'Artagnan, upon the cart, rolls   INTO VIEW. CONSTANCE It's him."
porthos,How considerate of the Cardinal to provide us with a snack. 
porthos,Champagne?
athos,You know I prefer wine. PORTHOS Don't go away.
athos,"Turn right at the next street. D'ARTAGNAN The next right...? ATHOS Turn. Athos growls, d'Artagnan jerks at the reins. The carriage careens around the corner, tipping on two wheels."
porthos," That's it. Next time, you drive."
athos,"Gentlemen, this is the end of the line. I hope you had a pleasant ride.  Unhitch the horses. D'ARTAGNAN But the Guards."
athos,Stand back.
porthos,I'd give five years of your life just to see the Cardinal's face!
aramis,Ten! CUT TO:
richelieu,"One thousand pistoles on each of their heads, dead or alive. The boy knows our plans."
aramis,"A good man, I'm told."
porthos,I knew there was something familiar about this boy. 
porthos,"You already have. His name is the Count De Rochefort. D'Artagnan isn't listening. He stands suddenly, turns, and walks away. He doesn't want the Musketeers to see the tears forming in his eyes. Aramis shouts after:"
aramis,D'Artagnan. CUT TO:
aramis,"A man is better measured by his life than by his death. Your father was bold, and brave."
aramis,He lives in you. That's all the evidence Aramis requires.       D'Artagnan pauses to reflect. Then wonders: D'ARTAGNAN And your father?
aramis,"I was orphaned at a young age. The church took me in. D'ARTAGNAN You didn't have one. ARAMIS But I did. He was a great man, a leader of the church. And his example inspired me to dedicate my life to God's service."
aramis,I joined the Musketeers and a strange thing happened. I got my faith back.
aramis," All of France knows him. His Eminence, the Cardinal Richelieu. D'Artagnan nearly jumps from his boots. CUT TO:"
porthos,"Go on. D'ARTAGNAN The Cardinal sent someone to England. With a secret treaty. ARAMIS What? D'ARTAGNAN He's made an alliance with a man named, Bucking... Buckingham. The Musketeers look at each other with alarm. PORTHOS The Duke of Buckingham? D'ARTAGNAN "
athos,Wait.
athos,Stay on your horse. D'ARTAGNAN He needs our help.
athos,Don't worry.   We'll help him.
aramis,"Gentlemen, I beg you. Please put away your weapons and remove these kegs from the road. We'd prefer to ride on without having to kill you. D'Artagnan and the ""Farmers"" gape at Aramis in surprise."
farmer,You're threatening us?
porthos,"It's not a threat, it's a fact. If you don't haul those kegs away, you're dead where you stand. The Farmer laughs, contemptuously. He raises his pistol and aims it at Porthos' head. But before he can pull the trigger, THREE EXPLOSIONS ERUPT from under the cloaks of Athos, Porthos and Aramis. When the smoke clears, d'Artagnan is startled to see the three dead ""Farmers"" sprawled in the road and the three pistols emerging from beneath the cloaks of the Musketeers. PORTHOS Mine hit the ground first. ATHOS Mine was taller. Aramis swings out of the saddle and begins to perform last rites over the bodies. D'Artagnan still can't be- lieve what just happened. He turns to Porthos. Porthos raises the barrel to his lips and blows away the gunsmoke."
porthos,"There's only one rule, d'Artagnan -- stay alive."
innkeeper,"Good evening. ATHOS See to our horses and bring us some food. INNKEEPER  In the name of God, I'm sure. Porthos is on the lookout for danger. He reaches inside his cloak for a weapon and, in doing so, accidentally exposes his Musketeer tunic."
innkeeper," Musketeers in my house! Gentlemen, put away your swords and come in. Anyone who fights the Cardinal is welcome here."
innkeeper,We don't have much but what we have is yours.
porthos,"Ladies, you're in for a treat tonight. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm the Musketeer they call Porthos. Porthos beams, waiting for a big response but nothing happens. The Barmaids look at each other. PORTHOS  Porthos."
porthos,"I said, 'A Queen is no different than a barmaid in the dark. Though less... practiced in the arts of pleasure...'"
porthos,"If you're going to be a proper Musketeer, you'll have to learn the manly art of wenching. Right, ladies? The Barmaids heartily concur. D'Artagnan looks over Porthos' shoulder, to the dark-haired Barmaid seen previ- ously. Porthos follows his gaze, grins. PORTHOS Ahh, very good. Your first subject. But you'll need instruction. Watch closely. Porthos pulls one of the Barmaids to his chest, brings her lips toward his. PORTHOS The secret to wenching is the first kiss. For in that kiss, a lasting impression is made. If it is weak, she will think you are weak. And if it is comical, she will think you are a clown. With me? D'ARTAGNAN Weak... weak.    Comical... clown."
porthos,"Very good.   And as a Musketeer is never weak,  and only rarely a clown, your  first kiss must be all the things  that you are. Like this... Porthos gives the Barmaid a powerful kiss.      He breaks it, turns to d'Artagnan with a grin."
aramis,Only if you don't know which words to say. All turn to regard Aramis. He'll play along too. Porthos reacts with delight. D'Artagnan with interest. Aramis continues: ARAMIS Words may make a more lasting impression than a thousand of Porthos' kisses. BARMAID 
aramis,Shakespeare. PORTHOS That's cheating. The Barmaid on his lap disagrees.
barmaid,"It's beautiful. D'Artagnan looks at the dark-haired Barmaid across the room. Porthos urges him on. PORTHOS Come on, d'Artagnan. We haven't got all night."
porthos,The boy's a natural. 
aramis,In all the years I've know him... I have never seen Athos smile.
athos,You fight like a Musketeer. Let's see if you can drink like one.
athos,Famous last words.  What shall we drink to?
athos,"Love.  Would you like to hear a story, d'Artagnan? A love story? Athos' voice reveals unexpected vulnerability, the pain he keeps inside. D'Artagnan is fascinated, moved. He nearly whispers:"
athos,He killed her. It seemed like the same thing after a while.
porthos,"Care to dance, Athos? ATHOS Only if I can lead."
innkeeper,"Excuse me, gentlemen."
athos,Well?
innkeeper,It's dawn. They turn in disbelief to the shuttered windows. Sure enough. Sunlight is peeking in through the cracks. CUT TO:
porthos,"You know,   d'Artagnan, it's not a good idea   to travel on an empty stomach.    You really should have had a big   portion of those sheep's brains..."
porthos, A connon ball.
aramis, How's your head now?
athos,"Stay with us, and you just might get your wish. Athos spurs his horse across the field, d'Artagnan and the Musketeers follow. But they discover crude battle- ments in their path. Athos changes direction, sees six horsemen waiting for them in the near distance. He changes direction again, as the horsemen charge after."
constance,Yes.
anne,"And when he looks at you, do you suddenly forget how to breathe? "
anne,Then you're in love.
constance, I am.
anne,Who is he? CONSTANCE You'll never believe it. ANNE Of course I will.
constance,You won't. ANNE Who? CONSTANCE The young man who rescued us from the bandit.
anne,The young man on the scaffold?
constance,Yes. ANNE  You're right. I don't believe it.
anne,What an impertinent question. 
anne,My love... is a matter of state. It's complicated. A sad beat.    Constance teases:
constance,Do you think about him all the time?
anne," As Queen, my mind touches on many subjects. CONSTANCE Do your knees feel as weak as water? ANNE Never. CONSTANCE When he looks at you, do you forget how to breathe? A beat. And Anne is a girl of eighteen again, not Queen. Wistful, she replies: ANNE I hope he will someday.   I hope I will too. HOLD ON Anne for a beat."
anne,Cardinal.
richelieu,I need your help. And could not in good conscience wait another minute.
anne,You want my help? RICHELIEU Yes.
anne,On what matter? RICHELIEU Your... husband. ANNE  Your King.
richelieu,"The Huguenot rebellion, occupation in the Antilles and Cayenne. The coming war with France. These are not the usual hobbies of youth. ANNE No. "
richelieu,He feels it is not... appropriate. ANNE It sounds as though he is concerned with more important matters.
richelieu,"Which is exactly why we must celebrate.  He will listen to you. If you will speak. Richelieu makes his case with forceful eloquence, seeming loyalty. Anne considers, replies, noncommittal: ANNE I will speak to him. Anne senses hidden agenda, intrigues below the surface. The conversation's conspiratorial tone begins to disturb her."
anne,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I... RICHELIEU Of course. Anne nods, turns back toward the chambers.       Richelieu calls after."
richelieu,Your Majesty? 
louis,Why is it I don't see any of my Musketeers?
richelieu,I'm afraid... that's impossible. LOUIS Why? 
louis,There must be some mistake.
richelieu,No mistake. I have reports from the local constables involved.
louis,"Your Eminence, I've been hearing some very troubling rumors about you."
louis,I've been thinking about that. A birthday celebration when we're on the brink of war...
richelieu," Your subjects are eager to celebrate the birth of their King at a time like this. LOUIS I'm not so eager. RICHELIEU I have an idea. Why don't you discuss the matter with your Queen? Louis looks up, wonders. As Richelieu draws him deeper into his spider's strategems."
aramis," Ten, twenty at the most."
ferryman,A privilege to carry you on my humble boat... The Ferryman turns a greedy eye on the Woman and child. FERRYMAN Two pistoles.
woman,But I only have one. Couldn't my child ride free? She's so small... FERRYMAN  Two pistoles. A courtly voice intervenes.
aramis,"Put away your money, madame. You and your child will cross the river under our protection. For free. "
aramis,Porthos! PORTHOS What? Aramis takes Porthos by the shoulder and turns him so he can see their pursuers pouring over the top of the hill on their horses. PORTHOS We sail!
91.,96   FLATBOAT                                                   96 Porthos laughs and taunts the angry pursuers. Aramis ties scarves around the horses' eyes to blindfold them for the crossing. Then he turns around and sees what Aramis is already seeing -- the two Cavaliers watch them with keen interest. FIRST CAVALIER You're those Musketeers everyone's been looking for.
porthos,Popularity has its price.
second cavalier,I'm listening.
porthos,"Let's see. You are, by your dress and by your manner, members of a bone-lazy class of servile ninnyhammers whose slavish allegiance to His Eminence the Cardinal is as that of a dog who likes nothing better than to sniff today where he has peed the day before. "
first cavalier,"May I reply? ARAMIS  By all means. FIRST CAVALIER Better to be a dog in the service of a great master, than a beef- witted moron so dazzled by the throne that he does not see the true nature of the foolish boy who wobbles atop it. Which is to say, that most muddy-brained of all men... a Musketeer. The Cavaliers have already pulled out their swords. Porthos and Aramis now reach for their own. Porthos deadpans: PORTHOS Maybe there's something  about us that just pisses people  off. At least I'd like to think  so. It's too bad we can only kill  them once."
porthos,"I've been called a lot of things in my time... ARAMIS  Porthos... PORTHOS But beef-witted is a little more than I can stand, not to mention unfair... ARAMIS Porthos... PORTHOS What? Aramis indicates the opposite shore as the flatboat approaches it. There, waiting patiently, swords and muskets already drawn... is a patrol of Cardinal's Guards."
aramis,Can you swim? PORTHOS  No.   My horse can. ARAMIS That'll do.
porthos,But...?
aramis,A nice relaxing boat ride...

athos,Ride to Calais and stop the Cardinal's agent.
athos,"All right. I'll toss a coin. Tails I stay, heads you remain. Agreed?"
athos,"Go! Athos turns away, SHOOTS at another horseman.       D'Artagnan runs to his MOUNT, GALLOPS away."
milady,Welcome back.    Did you dream?
milady,D'Artagnan. I like that. I am the Countess de Winter. Milady. D'ARTAGNAN Countess?
milady,My husband's dead.
milady,I have learned to live with death.
milady,"What...? D'ARTAGNAN Important business. MILADY How mysterious. A handsome young man with 'important business' in the still of night. Does it involve a young lady? D'ARTAGNAN No. MILADY Does it require clothes? D'ARTAGNAN Yes.   I need my clothes. MILADY They won't be ready for at least an hour. D'ARTAGNAN An hour? MILADY I told the  innkeeper to bring them when they  are dry. Until then, I'm afraid  you are my prisoner. Would the  prisoner care for a drink?"
milady,"Good. Then we will sit by the fire, and eat and drink, and you may impress, perhaps even move me, with the story of how you came to lie unconscious, in the middle of the night, on the road to Calais.  I love a good adventure. D'Artagnan hesitates, then steps to her. CUT TO:"
richelieu," The wonderful thing about an imaginary opponent is that he is always greatly skilled, and always easily defeated. The pride of victory, without the risk of loss. If only life were like that."
rochefort,I told you not to worry about the Musketeers. They are dead by now.
richelieu,Buckingham's signature will be on the treaty by morning.
rochefort,"The King's birthday celebration...? RICHELIEU Will proceed as planned. Thanks to the kind intercession of Queen Anne. Rochefort steps closer, speaks quietly. ROCHEFORT And our plans...?"
richelieu," Will proceed as well. Richelieu pours two glasses of port, offers one to Rochefort. They turn, raise their glasses to the King's portrait. And drink. CUT TO:"
milady,What brings you here? D'ARTAGNAN I'd like to tell you. But I can't.
milady,'Important business.'
milady,"Of course.  But, d'Artagnan, if this spy was to find out you are here, your life could be in grave danger. D'ARTAGNAN A Musketeer is not afriad of danger. MILADY I'm dangerous. You're not afraid of me? Her tone heralds a sudden shift. D'Artagnan sees the look in her eyes, can almost feel her lips upon him. But he resists. There is Constance's memory to consider. And midnight as it approaches. D'ARTAGNAN You're not dangerous."
milady,Then what am I?
milady,"Beauty, danger. They are the same. And with that, she reaches up to her hair, an ivory comb..."
milady,You came to Calais to stop a spy from sailing to England.
milady,We'll take him with us.

milady,"He is the brother of my late husband, Lord de Winter. He blames me for de Winter's death. He thinks I murdered him. D'ARTAGNAN Did you murder your husband, Milady? MILADY What do you think?"
milady,I know...
milady,"Well. If it's any consolation, you'll soon be joining them. Milady's return to form does not surprise. Parker shoves d'Artagnan toward the fog-enshrouded ship. A name can be made out on her barnacled hull. Persephone."
henri,"We are the Countess de Winter's party, arrived from Paris. Permission to come aboard."
henri,"Take us to your captain. The tall figure does not reply, nor does he move.        Henri demands: HENRI What are you, deaf? Henri goes to shake the man. He grabs his arm, and the man pitches forward, falling face first on the deck. Henri jumps back in alarm. Milady and the others react. BODYGUARD What is this? Milady's Bodyguards rush around the deck, confront the other silent silhouettes. They, like the tall figure... are dead. The limp bodies topple at their touch. The Bodyguards shout alarm and panic:"
bodyguards,Dead!   They're all dead!
aramis, You look like you've seen a ghost.
porthos,"Remind me to tell you the story of horses that could fly above raging waters. A heroic tale of love, death, and Musketeers. Suitable for the general public. Porthos wades into the Bodyguards, at play, shouting as he goes. PORTHOS All right then. All those who wish to die, raise your hands! Don't by shy, there's plenty to go around! D'Artagnan grabs a sword from the deck, turns to join the fray. And finds himself face to face with Parker, the Indo-Chinese bodyguard. Parker has two Oriental swords spinning in his hands. One knocks d'Artagnan's sword out of his hand. D'Artagnan does a back flip but falls on the slippery deck. As Parker is about to chop d'Artagnan's head off, his face grimaces as he is lifted on a sword OUT OF FRAME. In the mist Athos is revealed! ATHOS Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything? D'Artagnan almost cries with happiness.       He leaps to his feet and embraces Athos. D'ARTAGNAN I thought you were dead."
athos,"Keep your mind on the mission, d'Artagnan."
athos,"First, always find your enemy's weakness. Second, take advantage of it. Watch me."
sailor,"That's our ship... The two Sailors pull out daggers, and bound up the gangplank."

both sailors,Porthos the Pirate!!
porthos,I told you I was famous. D'ARTAGNAN Porthos the Pirate?
porthos,"Privateer.   There's a difference. Every Musketeer is running from something or someone. D'Artagnan deadpans: D'ARTAGNAN I love a good sea story.     Do tell me sometime. Porthos reacts to d'Artagnan's jest. But before he can reply, the youth has bolted back to the fray."
athos,Did you find the Cardinal's spy?
athos,No.
athos,"How did you do it, Sabine? How did you come back from the dead?"
athos,I did not.
milady,"No, Count. You were too proud to listen to the truth. I learned the value of lies soon after."
milady,"No. ATHOS Then I will shoot. Athos cocks the trigger.     Milady whispers: MILADY Be kind.   And aim for my heart. Athos' face is a mask of contradiction. He tries to pull the trigger, but it is not in him. Milady recognizes his pain with a nod. She feels it, too. Then, briefly, before she leaves him, Milady speaks softly. The past, their love, and where it led them."
milady,I remember... everything.
armand,"Countess de Winter... As d'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis arrive on the scene..."
aramis,He is not mentioned directly. But the agreement is contingent on a 'demonstration' of the Cardinal's power. D'ARTAGNAN A demonstration? What does that mean? ARAMIS I don't know. Athos' face grows dark. He has been silent throughout. Now he rises to his feet.
athos,"I know someone who does. D'Artagnan, Aramis, and Porthos watch in grim silence as Athos crosses the room to an imposing door. CUT TO:"
armand, She dies at dawn.
athos,Do you know the Cardinal's plans? MILADY Yes.
athos,Tell me.
milady,Will you spare my life? ATHOS I can't. 
athos,"Sabine. You'll die for your crimes. Nothing can stop that. But how you leave this world is up to you. Milady offers a half-smile, takes his hand in hers."
milady,What did the world ever do for me? HOLD ON Athos.       Milady's hand in his.   All that he is feeling. CUT TO:
executioner,I forgive you for your crimes. Die in peace.
athos,Die in peace.
executioner,"On your knees. Milady kneels, the Executioner steps closer. The tableau silhouetted against a reddish glow on the horizon. The Executioner brushes Milady's braid from her neck, exposing the soft white skin beneath. He raises the scimitar overhead, and just as he is about to bring it down... a cry is heard, torn from the heart:"
athos,No.
porthos,Athos -- But Athos breaks free.       Milady rises to her feet.   Athos rushes to her.
athos,"Forgive me, Sabine.       Please forgive."
milady,"The Cardinal intends to assassinate the King at his birthday celebration on Friday. And with that, Milady reaches forward, offers a gentle kiss. Then, as Athos and the others look on, stunned, uncertain... she takes a backward step, finds the cliff's edge... and steps over it. The Executioner rushes to look after. The others follow. Except for Athos, who remains rooted in place, eyes on the distant horizon. A long silence. THUNDER RUMBLES. EXECUTIONER God's justice be done."
athos,The King's life in danger.   We have work to do.
rochefort,"He can do it every time. Rochefort signals approval to a solitary marksman positioned far away on one of the roof parapets. The marksman rises from a shooter's crouch, bows curtly, and begins to reload his musket."
richelieu,"And he has no qualms about... ROCHEFORT None. He believes that man should honor no Kings before God. RICHELIEU A man of faith. How delightful.  Whatever you're paying him, double it. I want the King's birthday to be a memorable event. And rehang this painting in my chamber. Just as it is. HOLD ON Richelieu for a beat.   Framed by a sky filled with stars. His evil intent. CUT TO:"
louis,They look... happy.
anne,"Hungry, more likely. LOUIS Still, you were right about the celebration. And when the Cardinal told me how much it meant to you... ANNE I said nothing. LOUIS But... ? ANNE The Cardinal expressed in confidence how much the celebration would mean to you... Both pause to consider the manipulation."
richelieu,France will not go wanting. A new King will sit on the throne. The true King after all...
rochefort,"Yes, Your Eminence."
richelieu,"Are you sure? ROCHEFORT I'd stake my life on it, Your Eminence. RICHELIEU  Rest assured, Captain. You have."
athos, Look through the surrounding area. We'll try to reach the King...
louis,Leave us... alone. That's when a loud BOOM rocks the room.
richelieu," Kill him. Kill her, too."
rochefort,Not for long.
rochefort,I might... have been... mistaken.
richelieu,"Your Majesty, that document is an obvious forgery. I am clearly the victim of a conspiracy designed and perpetuated by these three Musketeers."
richelieu,You can't do this to me.   I'm the Cardinal of France. 
louis,"And as King... I hereby reinstate the Musketeers. A tremendous cheer is heard from all. Richelieu is led from the room. He pauses in front of d'Artagnan. RICHELIEU Congratulations, Monsieur d'Artagnan. I'll be keeping an eye on you. D'ARTAGNAN  Thank you, Your Eminence.    I'll be watching you, too. Richelieu smiles his crocodile smile. Followed by guards, he turns and strides away, hands clasped behind his back, scarlet robes billowing behind him. Louis turns to the Musketeers.       He indicates d'Artagnan."
louis,"Is this the young man who saved my life? Porthos puts a hand on d'Artagnan's shoulder. PORTHOS His name's d'Artagnan, Sire."
louis,"Approach, d'Artagnan."
louis,"Rise, d'Artagnan. And join them. Musketeer."
porthos,"His lips, unused as they are to such a contortion, twisted and stretched... into a smile."
aramis,It was spectacular. And what teeth.
