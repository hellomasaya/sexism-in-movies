allison,That doesn't mean they fucked.
harry,"Alright, she ain't comin' around."
heather, I know what I'm doing.

harry,"Uh, Heather, you want to step on it?"
heather,We'll get there.
allison,You don't even know for sure if she slept with Steve!
heather,"Listen, fuck that slut, okay?! She can fucking rot in hell! I'm not rushing for her slut ass!"
allison," Heather, c'mon, she's out cold!   We gotta hurry!"
heather,"I-don't-fucking-care!! That slut can kiss my ass!  You hear me, you fucking bitch?!"
18,"looks toward Emily, blank. He looks back up at the house, frustrated. He about-faces, steps over to the side of the neighboring house, unzips his pants, looks both ways to make sure the neighbors are not around, and starts pissing. Emily shakes her head and heads back toward the truck, turned off by the whole situation."
pizza pop," Hey-a, Jimmy, you don't hafta be here 'till 2:00! What's up, eh? You hungry?"

jessica,Just for a minute. I left my novel at Aaron's.
carlos,You need it now? Aren't you supposed to be watching her?
jessica,"Yeah, I'm stuck with her all weekend. I'm just gonna get through these last few weeks like I promised, and I'm done, I did a good thing, and some other moron can take a turn being her big sister."

jessica,What're you up to?
carlos,Guess who stopped by.
jessica,Who?
carlos,Guess.
jessica,Mary Lynn.
carlos,Yes.     Gigantic beast of a woman that she is.

derek,Then calm down. You told me to tell you when you're in one of your moods? Well guess what?

dave,"Jimmy?  Hey, what's up, man?"
jimmy,"Shit, Dave, sorry 'bout that. I was talkin' on the phone. I didn't see the stop sign, I guess."
dave,Don't sweat it.  I could give a shit about this thing. I was hopin' some rich doctor or lawyer or somethin' hit me.
jimmy,"Holy shit, man, is she alright?"
32,"Jimmy and Dave both stand near the passenger side of the car. The window is completely open. The Female Passenger lies motionless, bleeding noticeably from the forehead."
dave,She'll be alright. You didn't hit us that hard - it's gotta look worse than it is.
jimmy,"What're you, a fuckin' doctor?    We need ta get her to a hospital."
dave,"Fuck that, you'll have all kinds 'a problems if we do that. Cops, insurance and whatnot. You probably got drugs on you..."
jimmy,"Dave, look at her fuckin' head!     She's bleedin' all over the place!"
dave,"Just give her a minute, she'll snap out of it. She's a stripper, for god-sake."

dave,"Put that shit away. I'll take her home and give her some K, she'll be fine."
jimmy,She needs a doctor.   What the hell's K gonna do?
dave,"Jimmy, listen, she's gonna be fine. A guy like you should be avoidin' that kinda' attention."
33,JIMMY You should take better care of your girl.
dave,"Bro, she ain't my girl. She plows through all my drugs, and I fuck her like a goddam whore. She's a whore."
dave,"See, she's fine."
jimmy,"Holy shit. You're fucked up.  Hey, you need any juice or anythin'?"
dave,"No, man, I'm good."

dave,You been placin' bets with Bobby the Bookie again?
jimmy,"No. I'm just, I'm payin', like, twenty percent on my cards and shit, and it drives me fuckin' nuts, pissin' all my money away."
dave,"Sellin' drugs ta pay off the plastic, huh?"
jimmy,You want it?
dave,"Look, I'm definitely interested in a little bit for myself, definitely, but I ain't no dealer like you. Lemme think about it."
jimmy,"Hey, your nose is bleedin'."
dave,Seriously?
jimmy,"No, just horsin' around."
dave,"Listen, I gotta get going.    Patch her head up and shit."

dave,"Don't even sweat it, man, I told ya."
emily,"Yeah, so?     You do drugs."
corey,How would you know?
emily,Everybody knows my brother does drugs.
corey,So you heard about that thing that happened?
emily,"Yeah.   Everybody knows about that, too."
corey,"If you think so highly of me, what the hell are you doing here?"
emily,I'm just saying. Why'd you try to put everything back in the house?
corey,We ran outta of gas. We were right outside his house - what the hell else were we supposed to do? He wasn't supposed to be home for another hour. At least he took it easy on us.
emily," Here, I brought this."
corey,What for?
emily,"Dad gave it to you, remember?     You left it. I brought it for you."
corey,Keep it.     I don't wear hats.
emily,I don't want it.
corey,You go to see him at all?
emily,"In prison?     No, not lately."
corey,So what's the problem?     Vincent hitting you?
emily,Vincent?    Vincent's gone.   She's on Victor now.
corey,What happened to Vincent?
emily,He found out about Victor.
36,"PEDRO  Vamos, I need the address!     I have a pen in the truck!"
corey,So is Victor hitting you or what?
emily,No.
corey,What then?
emily,I don't wanna talk about it.     Forget it.
pedro," Hurry up, mehn!"
emily,You know he has porno magazines all over his truck.
corey,So?
kevin,It's a moped.
corey,Just lay off it.
pedro,Gracias.
corey,If you think you can.
pedro,Maybe you think you can talk to her for me?
corey,"Pedro, she's fifteen!"
pedro,"No way, mehn.  No con esas tetas."
corey,"I'll have you sent to jail, man.     I'm serious."
pedro,No way she is fifteen.     She looks way older.
corey,"She'll look a lot younger on the witness stand, with my mom sitting in the courtroom."
pedro,"Bueno, tell her I say good-bye.     I call you soon."
corey,So what're you gonna do?
pedro,"I'm gonna find Mr. Cocksucker and say, ""Look, mehn, let us into our fucking home."""
38,COREY Wait a second... Why are you still driving this thing? I thought you got fired.
pedro,"Si, si, but I need it. How am I gonna drive without my truck. They fired me, mehn."
allison,I hate this job.
heather,I should pick up one of them assholes.
allison,Don't you have an appointment with Dr. Cook?
heather,"Five-thirty, and I'm not missing it."
allison,Derek probably thinks you're sleeping with your doctor. There's nothing wrong with you.
heather," Ally, I have a pain right here that has nothing to do with my head. My dad died of heart disease, and if that asshole taught me anything, it's better to be paranoid than dead."
39,"A FEMALE POLICE OFFICER, a prim-and-proper plain-jane 5'5"" woman in her early twenties, exits the building and walks over to talk with the two Male Police Officers."
allison,You're just guessing.
heather,"Ally, I know that's her.     That's his type, too. That little slut."
allison,Harry's waiting.
heather,Sorry if I snapped.
allison,You didn't snap.
heather,I mean this morning.
allison,Oh.   That's okay.
heather,"I'm just afraid its gonna be the whole thing all over again with Derek, and then I've got to find some other asshole, and do it all again. I'm sick of the whole cycle."
allison,So do something different.
heather,"I'm trying, but he's fucking it all up."
jessica,"Yeah, where are you?"
carlos' voice,"Right down the street, gettin' some more nachos."
jessica,Can you just come back and get me?     Hurry up.
troy,Holy shit.
jessica,"Aaron, I don't know how the hell you got..."
aaron, Fucking bitch!
pitt," Use the back door, yo!"
aaron," Man, don't be helpin' that bitch!"
pitt,I don't want to see you be hittin' no girl. Just calm your ass down.
aaron,Fuck you!
41,TROY He's gonna kill her.
aaron,"Where you goin', bitch?!"
jessica,Drive!
carlos, What's the deal?
jessica,Fucking drive!
aaron,"Fuck you, you filthy fuckin' whore!"
jessica,"Oh my God, my fucking eyes!"
carlos,"Jesus, look at my car, Jess!"
jessica,That fucking... asshole!
carlos,Now I'm screwed too.
jessica, I'm so sorry.
43,"PEDRO Hey, mehn, let me into my fucking apartment."
pedro,I'm hitching up your car to my tow truck.
pedro,"Let me in my fucking apartment, mehn!"
pedro,"I'm gonna pay, mehn!   I got fired!"
pedro,"Listen, don't be a cocksucker.   It's not needed."
pedro,"I need a job, mehn, then I pay you."
44,"PEDRO You need some balls, mehn!     Why do you let her slap you around?!"
pedro,"Hay, por favor! I come by here to pay rent, I always hear her slapping your ass around."
matt,"Dude, what the hell?! I'm ready to go here! Where the hell were you?!"
jimmy,I got into a freakin' accident!
matt,"Bullshit, man, fucking bullshit! You make me come all the way out here! I been waitin'!"
jimmy,"Look, you're pissin' me off now! Remember who's doin' fuckin' who the favor! I got shit I gotta do!"
45,"MATT  Fine, fine! Just give it to me."
jimmy,"I didn't want to bring my bag to your house, with your fuckin' parents home."
matt,I lent it to Jerry.
jimmy,What'd you do that for?    Get it back.
matt,He moved down the shore.    This morning.
jimmy,"Alright, sixty bucks."
matt,What?   Fer one freakin' jar?!
jimmy,"Dude, stop your bitchin' and pay up.      I told you this shit, I told you."
matt,"You said extra, I thought you meant, like, fifty!"
jimmy,"Asshole, fifty is the regular fuckin' price!"
matt,"This is fuckin' extortion! Knowin' I'm meetin' this chick, so you jack up the price!"
jimmy,"Look! This is a pain in my ass, comin' way out here, and I said I'd charge you extra. I don't give a shit if its ten over the regular price, or twenty-five over your fuckin' ""discount price,"" but you're payin' sixty bucks for this jar."
matt," I need some cash for food and drinks, man! I'm takin' this girl out!"
jimmy, Gimme fifty even.
matt,"C'mon, man! I need as much cash as I can get! What if she wants to go somewhere?! And gas! Dude, just take forty-five!"
jimmy," Fine, you cheap-ass fuckin' bastard."
matt, See ya.
pedro's voice,"He said ""no,"" mehn. The cocksucker won't let us back in."
corey,That's great.
pedro,"Hey, this isn't my fault, mehn."
47,PEDRO  Hello?
pete,Corey.
rob's voice, Hello?
pete,And the grass needs to be cut.
corey," Okay, I'll take care of it."
pete, Don't forget to put gas in it.

rob's voice,Hey.
corey,You got any spare cash?
corey,Maybe he can.
heather,Are you comin' with me to register tomorrow?
allison,I dunno.
heather,Why not?
allison,My brother spent six thousand on tech courses and he's still painting houses.
heather, I'm gonna be late.
allison,Why don't you just reschedule?
heather,You know how booked he always is. I don't wanna be referred to that quack Hengis. I don't trust women doctors.
allison,Dr. Hengis is fine. You're the quack.
heather,"Ally, I'm really feeling something. A deep ache, like someone's crushing me. This can't wait."
allison,You still feel like going out?
heather,Hell yes.
jimmy,"Yeah, its Jimmy."
jimmy, I got into an accident!
jimmy,"I'm fine!    My car's banged up, but I'm on my way!"
jimmy,Yeah!

kwon,"What the fuck do I care, you think it's a good question?! Are you fucking kidding me?!"
jimmy,"Look, I didn't think of it.    I got a lotta shit on my mind right now."
kwon,"Jimmy, do you have my drugs?"

aaron, Fuck this asshole.
troy,"No, man, I don't wanna see you hittin' Jess neither."

aaron's voice,"Jess, come back here."

aaron,"Jess, I'm serious.      We need to talk about this."
jessica,Isn't that what we're doing?
aaron,Fine!   Who'd you fuck?
jessica,Nobody.
aaron,"Bull-fuckin'-shit! I got bumps on my dick, and I never cheated!"
jessica,"Maybe its just a rash, 'cause I don't have anything."
aaron,Why don't we go to the doctor and get you checked out?
jessica,"I can go to the doctor by myself.     And if I have it, I got it from you!"
aaron,You're fuckin' fulla shit!
jessica,"Whatever. If you come after me again, I'm gonna find someone to kick your ass. I mean it."
aaron,"I believe it, you fuckin' whore! 'Cause it's probably the same dude you been bangin' behind my back!"
jessica,I never cheated.
aaron,Tell Carlos I'm gonna kick his ass.
carlos, What's up?
jessica,He's pissed.    Says he's gonna kick our asses.
carlos,Great.    I got a baseball bat in the trunk.
jessica,Good.
carlos,I gotta go to work in an hour.
jessica,Call in sick.
carlos,"Yeah, maybe. You mean it when you said you were gonna find someone to kick his ass?"
jessica,Yeah.

58,COREY Hey Mr. Carson. I got the rent.
corey,"That's all we have. We'll give you the rest later, as soon as we can."
corey,"Mr. Carson, c'mon! This is just temporary. Pedro lost his job."
corey,Aren't you supposed to take us to court before you throw us out?
corey,"Aw, c'mon! Don't be like that! We're doin' our best! We're gonna be homeless!"
59,Mr. Carson slams the door.
corey, C'mon!
older man,"Hey, can I park here?"
pedro, The transmission is broke.   Transmissions on these cars suck.
older woman," Oh, and the tire's flat, too."
pedro,"Ah, si, but that's no big deal.   That's fine, believe me."
older man,Good luck.
pedro,Gracias!
heather,"Are you sure you're using that thing right? I feel this ache  Right here, like I'm being crushed between two boards."
heather,I don't need a head doctor!
61,"DR. COOK  Heather, if you're going to insist on ignoring my rules, at least put your blouse on before you light up."
heather,Can't I be concerned about my health?!   Is that so outrageous?!
heather,"I just don't want to be walking around tomorrow and drop dead because my heart collapses, and so that makes me weird or paranoid..."
heather," Okay, yeah, see you next week."
allison,I'm two pounds heavier I think.
derek,Sorry.
allison,"It hurt. I knew it would hurt, but that was kinda worse than I thought. Does Heather... like it?"
derek,She never let's me do it.
allison,She doesn't?    Why not?
derek,I don't know. She does shave though.    How come you don't shave?
allison,I don't know. I don't want to.     Do you love her?
derek,I don't know.
allison,How can you not know?
derek,She's got problems.
allison,I don't understand you. Why do you even cheat on her with me? She's so pretty. So much prettier than me.
derek,"She's   a nutcase. I'll tell you what, I don't   know why you do it. You should have a man   of your own - we say it all the time,   me and Heather."
allison,"Yeah, who? That slob you and Heather introduced me to last time?"
derek,He outranks me. He's a good guy.
63,"ALLISON Like me, I'm a good girl, and the best I can do is a guy that looks like that?"
derek,No.
allison,You must think so. You tried to set me up with him.
derek,I thought it was a bad match.     It was Heather's idea.
allison,So she thinks I can't do better.
derek,You know what she thinks better than me.
allison,"Let's get dressed, she'll be here."
derek,"Let's let her walk in on us, and look surprised."
allison,Hurry up.
pizza pop,Hey-a Jimmy.    Where you been?
jimmy,Around.     Deliverin'.
pizza pop,Hurry - sit down Anna eat something.       We got more deliveries for you.
jessica,Did your parents call?
katie,Nope!    Where were you?
jessica,Out with Carlos.
katie,The VCR is broken.
jessica," 'Los, are you hungry?!"
katie,Are we going to have TV dinners all weekend?
jessica,No.     I promise. You want some milk?
katie,Can I have ice-tea?
jessica,Of course.  Can you make her some ice-tea?
carlos,Aren't you gonna eat?
jessica,I'm gonna take a shower.
katie,Are you Jessica's new boyfriend?
carlos,No.
katie,I wish you were. I don't like Aaron.
carlos,Neither do I.
katie,Don't you like Jessica?
carlos,"Kind of, I guess. She's nice."
heather,Take a look at that paper. There's at least a half dozen apartments I circled that would be perfect.
derek,"Yeah?  Alright, ten minutes."
heather, Great.
derek,That was Tess. Said I had to come back in.
heather,Are you fucking Tess?
derek,"What? No. Look, I gotta go. I'll see you at Carter's when I get off."
heather,I'm not dropping this!
derek,Since when do you drop anything?
heather,You see that? He practically said yes.
allison,What're you doing?
heather,I'm gonna look through his shit.
67,"ALLISON You're finally flipping, I think."
heather,"You're a lot of help, Ally.        Really. Thanks."
allison,So what.   Condoms.
heather,"Ally, I'm on the fucking pill. He hasn't used condoms with me for weeks."
allison,So maybe those are left-overs.
heather,"Ally, these are not left-overs.        He never used regular condoms with me."
allison, Why not?
heather,"Because if he did, he took two fucking days to come. I always made him wear ultra-thin, ribbed, anything but this shit."
allison,He took too long for you?
heather,"Ally, I'd be done, and I'd have to lie there like another hour 'till he got off. I couldn't fucking stand it. Why the hell do you think I started on the pill, Ally? Me. Putting that hormone shit in my body."
allison,How would I know?
heather,"Well that's why.  Anyway, that's neither here nor fucking there. That asshole is using"
68," these things, and not on me."
allison,Just call him and ask him.
heather,"No, no, fuck that. We're going to go to the party, have some fun. When he's all good and drunk, you're going to ask him when I'm not around."
allison,Yeah right.
heather,"Ally, I'm serious. If he's drunk and having fun, and you just work it in on him real casual, he may slip. He'll never admit shit to me."
allison,He won't to me either.
heather,Ally!   Just fucking try it!
allison,I don't wanna spy on him for you!
heather,"Ally, look, he's cheating on me, I know it in my heart, but I want him to admit it, alright? Before I fucking flush what's left of this shithole relationship down the toilet, I want him to admit it."
allison,"Fine, I'll see."
heather,Fine.

jimmy, Who?
dave,This spear-chucker from Manville. Sold me some fake D-ball once. I tied his brother's dog to my front bumper and we talked it out. Turned out to be an okay guy. I gave him a call and he's definitely lookin'.
jimmy,For how much?
dave,"Well, he's pretty small time, but he's itchin' to move up a few notches."
jimmy,He's got money?

berubi,You got evicted?
pedro,"Si. I went out to get a gallon of milk for my dog, I come back, my keys don't work, and the cocksucker put an eviction notice on the door. He didn't even tell us! Now my milk's spoiling in my truck, Pancho's probably pissing all over the place, I'm fucked."
77,"BERUBI Hey, listen, if you want, you can crash in Jerry's room. He moved out."
pedro,He did?

carlos,Did you know he was having a party?

jessica,Wait here a second and let me talk to him.
78,"Without waiting for a response, Jessica turns around and climbs onto the back porch, walking its length toward Carter, who is kneeling with his back to us as he puts a TAP on the KEG. Carlos stands watching, not sure what to do."
carter,I'm done.
jessica,"Carter, I brought your sunglasses back."
carter,Those were Jerry's anyway.

carter,He hit you?
jessica,Yes.
carter,"Like, he slapped you?"
jessica,"No, he punched me. With his fist, a bunch 'a times."
carter,Why?    What'd you do?
jessica,I didn't do shit.
carter,"Look, I ain't gonna sit here all night. Tell me what happened. None 'a your bullshit."

carter,Why's he think that?
jessica,It doesn't matter.
80,CARTER Fine.

carter,"Whatever, Jess, what-the-fuck-ever.      And I'm sure I'm the only one."
jessica,"Look, don't even get into the cheating thing, 'cause you're seein' Rachel still. Don't call me the slut."

jessica,"Fine. Just, I need your help with Aaron. Just help me this one last time, that's it."
carter,"He's probably gonna be here tonight, Aaron."
jessica,You're kidding. You barely even know who he is!
carter,"No, but I know Troy real good. He said he'd be bringin' him. I ain't got nothin' against Aaron, so I said ""what the hell."""
jessica,"Look, can you just kick his ass for me? Please?"
carter,"Shit, Jess, I don't wanna be fightin' no friend 'a Troy's. Can't you just work this shit out?"
jessica,"Carter, he hit me! And sprayed me with pepper spray!"

carter,"Whadda you mean what'll I do?!  I'm gonna dance with him! Fuckin' I'll beat his ass! I don't wanna, but if he shows up tonight and makes like he's gonna hit you, I'll beat his ass."
jessica,What if he doesn't come?
carter,"Troy said he was bringin' him. If he doesn't, call him or somethin'. But I'm not a fuckin' bounty hunter whose gonna chase Aaron across the goddam country."
jessica,"Alright, fine."
carter,You're welcome.
jimmy,Thirty bucks.

jessica,"Yeah, I can hear it.  Katie?"
corey," I don't know about leaving the car out there in the open like that. You think we should, like, hide it somewhere?"

rj,You're Jimmy?
jimmy,You're Sinjin?
rj,RJ. Sinjin said you'd be wearin' a bookbag. They're back here.

card player,I ain't happy about it.
heather,"Shut up and drink, asshole.  I should call him."

corey,Go find Mitch.
92,CARLOS Take it easy. You got to go back and watch Katie.
jessica,Don't remind me. Please.
carlos,You signed up for it.
jessica,"It seemed like a good idea then! Give some crappy advice every once in a while. I didn't think it'd be this constant torture, always wanting to do something, go somewhere. I'm so sick of it."
carlos,Some big sister.
berubi,Shut the door!
93,ALLISON Hey!   Fuck... you! I would never!
heather,"Alright, alright! You little slut! I got one for you!  Right over there in front of the door!"

mitch,What're you mixing it with?
heather,Vodka.
mitch,Really? A little girl like you. You think I might get you to share a little of that?
heather,I don't know. There's not much left.
mitch,"If you do something nice for me, I might do something nice for you."
heather,I'm not that kind of girl.
95,MITCH No?  How about your friend here?

pedro," Vamos, these girls aren't interested in you."
mitch, Pedro... what the fuck...
pedro,"Come on, mehn. Come check out the Mustang."
allison,"Oh shit, I think I'm gonna be sick."
96,"Allison plops down on all fours, and begins vomiting violently. Heather kneels down next to Allison and pulls her hair back so it doesn't get hit by the vomit."
heather,That's nasty.

bobby,Sayeed's little brother?
jimmy,Yes. And Louie and RJ.     Fucking three guys.

jimmy," And nothin'! Goddamit fuckin' Bob, I'll handle everything. Everything. You just sit your big fuckin' ass there, it'll be enough. They won't fuck with you, bein' in prison and shit."
98,"BOBBY Jimmy, I ain't in a mood to help you right now. I really ain't. You're wreckin' my livelihood. Soon no one pays me. And I fuckin' help you? You're a thorn in my balls."
jimmy,"Look Bobby, alright, I told 'em I had a partner, that's you. You're gonna help me now or you're not. And if you don't, I'm a little fucked."
bobby,"What the hell's the matter with you? What the fuck is going on in your head? You comin' to me, knowin' I'm pissed at you, and what for."
jimmy,"Jesus, Bobby, I'll owe you. Alright? I'll owe you. Just help me out here. Help me."
emily,I still go there. I'm a freshman.
emily,My brother.   Corey.   Becker.
emily,Unfortunately.

corey,Make an offer.
mitch,Twelve hundred.
corey,Twelve hundred! That's nothing!
mitch,"Look, there's a lotta shit that Jeremy's gotta do with it. It's not like he can just switch the fuckin' plates and it's a go."
pedro,"Coo, we got thrown outta our apartment! We need more money!"
mitch,Steal some more cars.   I'll see what I can do.
carlos,Aaron's here.
aaron, Hey guy.
carlos,Hey.
aaron,You like talking to my girl?
carlos,"Aaron, I didn't mean nothin'."
aaron,No?     Just friends?
carlos,Yeah.
aaron,"What's the matter, don't like her that way?"
102,"JESSICA Fuck you, I'm clean. You're the cheatin' asshole with bumps on your cock."
aaron, Hold this.
jessica,"Fuck you. I'm going to get Carter, and he's gonna kick your ass."
aaron,Carter ain't gonna kick shit.
jessica,"We'll see, right?"
aaron,Hold on a minute ...
jessica,"That's for the pepper spray, asshole!"

berubi, You're lucky.
jessica,"Carter, what the hell?!    You said you were gonna kick his ass!"
carter,"I said I would step in if he hit you, and he's not gonna hit you."
104,JESSICA This is fuckin' bullshit!
troy," Woe, dude."

heather,"I'm all talk. I can't cheat on Derek. I love Derek. It's just that he makes me so mad. And that makes me a psycho. Every time a girl loses her temper, she's a"
105,fucking psycho.   Can't I be upset without being a psycho?   Can't I just be mad?
allison,"It's just every time you find a woman near Derek, you go absolutely nuts."
heather,"Let's not use the word nuts, alright?"
allison,You know what I mean.
heather,"Yeah, well, don't say nuts."
allison,"Alright, you are mighty, mighty... not very nice when another girl is near your boyfriend."
heather,"Don't say nuts, don't say psycho, don't-"
allison, I don't say those things.
heather,Yes you do!   Yes you do!
allison,"What I meant, I don't mean them. I meant that I don't mean them. That I don't mean to say them."
heather,"Well, what do you mean?"
allison,"I don't know. I mean, you get so angry, it's a little scary."
106,"HEATHER  Oh, I don't mean to! I'd never say anything to hurt you, Ally!"
allison," I know. Deep down, I know.      But you get so angry..."
heather,"I'm so sorry! Oh, you're right! I am a psycho! A rotten-bitch-psycho! I scare you - Ally - who would never hurt anyone or, or anything!"
allison,"It's alright, I know you don't mean it!"
heather,I don't mean it! You're my best friend! My sister! I love you so much!
allison,"No, maybe you shouldn't.     Maybe I don't deserve it!"
heather,You deserve it! You're so perfect!
allison,"Don't say that! I'm not, I'm not!"
heather,Yes you are!
107,"Most of the crowd has stopped cheering. Heather continues to kick at Allison's limp body, and two SKINNY GUYS pull Heather away. Heather shakes them off and leaves in a huff, while everyone is tending to Allison."
