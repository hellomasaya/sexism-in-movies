Speaker,Dialogue
margaret,How much is the milk?
margaret,Too much. Much too much butter.
denis,I like butter. MARGARET Milk's gone up.
june,"I don't understand how it happened, how could she possibly have got out? It's very very important -"
police guard,Dixon.
june,"Beautiful day. Oh, you've made a start. Carol's coming soon, I'll get some bags. Anything you want to go to Mark, I'll bring up a suitcase for it."
margaret,No no no no. The grey.
margaret,Yes.
margaret,"Oh, I haven't had a chance to look at that yet, dear."
june,Sorry.
denis,Atta-girl.
margaret,Blot it...Blot it..
june,Sorry ?
denis,Now look what you've done. Are they to keep the loonies out or you in?
margaret,Wear your scarf. There's a chill out there.
susie,Good morning Lady Thatcher. Are you alright ?  How are you feeling ?
margaret,"I'm fine, thank you Susie."
susie,I've just been reading about the bombings.
margaret,Yes. Frightful.
susie,Sorry.
margaret,"Yes, of course, dear. Today."
susie,"The invitation has come from Downing Street for the unveiling of your portrait. I'll put it on the mantelpiece, and there's an invitation from Lord Armstrong for lunch on the first Friday of next month."
margaret,What are they playing?
susie,I think they said Rogers and Hammerstein.
margaret,Silly man.
alfred,Did someone cover the butter?
margaret,I'll go.
beatrice,Leave it.
alfred,"Not just big business but small businesses, like mine."
beatrice, Margaret!
alfred,We on this island are strong. We're self-reliant. Sometimes we're plain bloody minded.
alfred oov, Open it then.
margaret, I've got a place at Oxford.
alfred,Don't let me down Margaret.
margaret, Mother?
beatrice, My hands are still damp.
beatrice, Margaret!
denis, They're talking about you again.
denis,Sun's not quite over the yard arm. Time for tea.
margaret,What have you got on your head?
denis,"Found it in the cupboard and thought bugger it, it's Friday, why not fancy dress?"
margaret,You look ridiculous.
denis,Bosslady no like?
margaret," No, Denis, Bosslady no like."
margaret, Feet.
denis vo,"Oh, rumbled!"
carol oov,Can I suggest you remove the sticker from the back of your car.
carol oov,"Hello June, any news? I've brought every bag I could find."
carol,Hello Ma. Bloody taxi driver. Wouldn't take my card. I said don't have a sticker saying you take Visa and then insist on cash. Can you believe it? I was rummaging around the bottom of my bag. He didn't get a tip.
margaret,"I didn't know that you were dropping by today, dear."
carol," Yes, you said yesterday...You wanted to make a start on Dad's things. The cupboards ? Then I can help you dress."
margaret,Jaqueline...
carol,Coming for dinner tonight.
margaret,Of course.  We're having halibut.
carol,Oh God. Isn't it terrible?
denis,"It'll be fine. Come on, get your head down, it's ten to three, for God's sake."
margaret," We must release a statement, offering our condolences."
carol,I'm sure they've already-
margaret,"We must never, ever, ever give in to terrorists."
carol,"Now ma, are we going long or just below the knee tonight?"
margaret,"Oh, below the knee I should think."
carol,I hear you went out today...You mustn't go out on your own Mummy. We've talked about that.
margaret,There was no milk.
carol,Call Robert he'll get it for you if June's not up-
margaret,I am not for the knackers yet.
carol,No one is saying that.
margaret,"If I can't go out to buy a pint of milk then what is the world coming to. Really Carol, please don't fuss about it. You've always been like this, fuss fuss fuss. You must find something better to do with your time. It's most unattractive in a woman. When I was your age the last thing I wanted to do was fuss around my mother."
denis,"Four down, 9 letters."
margaret,Obstinate.
carol,What?
margaret,Pearls. I'll wear the pearls.
carol,"It's nearly all familiar faces, William, Michael and his lovely wife-"
margaret,Jacqueline.
carol,"And then there's Peter, James R and James T and that very nice man-"
margaret,Yes-
carol,- we met last year.
margaret,Yes I remember-
carol,I think he's bringing his new lady friend just to mix it up a bit. We're rather short on women - but I'm sure we'll manage-
margaret,I've always preferred the company of men-
carol,Ma?
margaret,"Well I don't like coalitions, never have..."
denis vo,Start on the outside...
denis vo,...and work your way in.
portly host,"...Attlee has his sights set on the steel industry, you mark my words."
male guest,"Yes, hold your breath, sir, that's government property!"
portly host,"So was your father a political man, too, Miss Roberts?"
margaret,"Oh, yes, to his core. And Mayor of Grantham."
portly host,And a grocer as well!
margaret,Yes.
hostess,"And did you help, err, in the...shop?"
margaret,"Oh, yes. It was a family business."
margaret,That and a degree from Oxford.
margaret, Whisky.
margaret,"What I do think is that a man should be encouraged to stand on his own two feet. Yes we help people of course we help people. But for those that can do, they must just get up and do. And if something's wrong, they shouldn't just whine about it, they should get in there and DO something about it, change things."
portly host,"With all due respect, Miss Roberts, what may have served in Grantham-"
margaret,Can serve very well for the people of Dartford too.
male guest,Really?
margaret,"I know much more than those who have never lived on a limited income. Just like the man or woman on the street, when I am short one week, I have to make economies the next."
margaret,"A man might call it fiscal responsibility, a woman might call it good housekeeping."
male guest,"I'm not sure a home economics lesson is quite what the Dartford constituents need. They see industry being nationalized, the unions on the up, the pound on the slide...whoever can sort that lot out - he's my man."
margaret,Or woman?
hostess,Ladies shall we ?
portly host,"Miss Roberts, do join the ladies."
michael,"So, Margaret, how would you have dealt with this if you'd been Prime Minister?"
margaret,Where?
carol,"The bombings, mummy. Today?"
margaret,"No, uhm, yes - we have always lived alongside evil. But it has never been so patient, so avid for carnage, so eager to carry innocents with it into oblivion."
male guest,"So, would you -"
margaret,"Western civilization must root out this evil, wherever it hides, or she risks defeat at the hands of global terror in a nuclear age. Unimaginable!"
peter,The Prime Minister gave a very good statement I thought.
margaret,Yes. Clever man. Quite a smoothie.
margaret,You don't mind if I sit down...
female guest,I heard you speak at conference in 1984 in Brighton just after the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel. You were remarkable. I hope you appreciate what an inspiration you have been for women like myself.
margaret,It used to be about trying to do something. Now its about trying to be someone.
female guest,"Well anyway, I...thank you."
margaret,Good night to you.
carol,OK...hold on to me...that's right.
margaret,"Can you do the clasp, I can't quite -"
carol,You've got an eyelash.
margaret,What does Mark think about it?
carol,Mark?
margaret,Yes. Tell him to come up. I want to talk to him about it.
carol,Mark's with Sarah and the children.
margaret,"Well tell him to come up and see me after he's kissed them good night, would you Carol darling?"
carol,He's not here Mummy.
margaret,"You look exhausted, dear. You really must try to get some sleep. Taxis'll be few and far between at this hour..."
carol,Righty-ho. Night night Ma. Sleep well.
margaret,"Good night, dear."
radio announcer,"Twenty-four-year-old Miss Margaret Roberts lost her bid to win a seat in Parliament today, but she has put new life into the Dartford Conservative Association. Winning candidate Mr Dodds had better watch out, this bright young woman is on his tail."
denis,Eat!
margaret,Disaster.
denis,Hang on...Hang on...Hang on...
margaret,Not splendidly enough.
denis,Ah I see. Self pity.
margaret,What game?
denis,You are a grocer's daughter-
margaret, -And proud of being-
denis,- in their eyes. A single grocer's daughter. But if you were to become the wife of a moderately successful businessman-
margaret,Yes. Yes!
denis,What ?
margaret,I love you so much but...I will never be one of those women Denis - who stays silent and pretty on the arm of her husband. Or remote and alone in the kitchen doing the washing up for that matter.
denis, We'll get a help for that.
margaret,"No - one's life must matter, Denis. Beyond the cooking and the cleaning and the children, one's life must mean more than that - I cannot die washing up a tea cup."
denis,"That's why I want to marry you, my dear."
margaret,"There they are, my little twins. Mark..."
denis,"Cornwall, wasn't it? Bloody hell... Look at `em, little imps. You never really got golf, did you?"
margaret,You look happy.
denis,"Yes, I do, don't I? You're drinking too much."
margaret,They grow up so fast.
margaret,Mark.
speaker vo,"Mr Eric Deakins, Labour..."
margaret,"There they are, my little twins. Mark..."
denis,"Cornwall, wasn't it? Bloody hell... Look at `em, little imps. You never really got golf, did you?"
margaret,You look happy.
denis,"Yes, I do, don't I? You're drinking too much."
airey neave,Mrs Thatcher ! Airey Neave. Welcome to the madhouse. Follow me.
speaker,The Right Honourable Lady the Secretary of State for Education.
margaret,The right honourable gentleman knows that we have no choice but to shut down the schools!
shadow minister,Methinks the Right Honourable lady doth screech to much. If she wants us to take her seriously she must learn to calm down!
margaret,"If the right honorable gentleman could perhaps attend more closely to WHAT I am saying, rather than HOW I am saying it, he may receive a valuable education in spite of himself!"
shadow minister,Why has this Conservative government failed? Why has it forced so many in the public sector into taking strike action to save their own jobs?
heath,So these power cuts will continue unless we can reach a compromise.
minister 1,"Hear hear, Prime Minister."
heath,"- the fact of the matter is, it's absolutely crucial that we are seen by the public to be acting as conciliators and not aggressors.  Yes, Education Secretary."
margaret,Yes...
heath,Be patient. They'll come back on in a minute.
alfred,"He meant it as an insult but to me it's a compliment. That's why he couldn't beat us, and that's why Hitler can't beat us."
carol,"I swear, it's all gone completely out of my head. My driving instructor thinks I should pass but I feel as if I've hardly had any lessons. Ridiculous isn't it? Maybe third time lucky. MARGARET Right. The only thing you should remember is that everyone else is either reckless or inept. And often both. MARGARET eyes the road, gesturing CAROL to move forward."
carol,Right-o.
margaret,Move over... Move to your right a little bit...
carol,But if I move to the right aren't I on the wrong side of the road?
margaret,Carol!
carol,Well he's in the way!
margaret,"To the right. Move to the right! A yelp from CAROL as the car swerves a little, narrowly missing a lone CYCLIST- MARGARET  So sorry! Terribly sorry! MARGARET throws a wave from the wound down window. The CYCLIST swerves on recognizing her, watching as the car goes round and round the square, almost balletic."
carol,"Hey, look at me, driving! CAROL's squeals of delight, let loose on the open road. The tyres screech on the corner."
carol,"Thanks Ma, that was terrific! I really feel I've got a handle on it now."
margaret,"Have you been trying to make breakfast? For Goodness sake, Denis!"
denis,"I can boil a bloody egg. CAROL Mummy took me for a test drive - We went absolutely everywhere. All over the place - MARGARET  I've decided. I'm going to run. MARGARET smiles, a growing resolution gripping her. DENIS What for? MARGARET I'm going to run for Leader of the Party. CAROL'S utter disappointment on seeing she has lost MARGARET already."
carol,Silly me!
denis," All the time I thought I was having a driving lesson, it was all about my mother, just for a change!"
margaret,What's she on about?
denis,It's her driving test this morning!
margaret,"Oh, right. Of course."
denis,"The Prime Minister has been very loyal to you, MT. He tries, with a trembling hand, to scoop boiled eggs from the pan. MARGARET But he's weak, and he's weakened the party. One must know when to go.  You're shaking. She reaches out. DENIS I can do it! DENIS pulls his arm away, sending boiled eggs flying. SILENCE. MARGARET Goodness me! What is the matter with everyone this morning? A beat. He looks utterly fragile. DENIS I've told you what the matter is. The business is a bit rocky at the moment and the Doctor thinks I need a rest. MARGARET And do you need a rest?"
margaret,Where did you go?
denis,South Africa.
margaret,Yes.
margaret,When did I lose track of everyone?
denis,Too busy climbing the greasy pole MT.
margaret,"Oh that's rather easy to answer, actually. They are unafraid of success."
airey neave,Important.
reece,Yes. Give it more impact. But the main thing is your voice. Its too high. It has no authority.
airey neave,Methinks the Lady doth screech too much
reece,"People don't want to be harangued by a woman or hectored. Persuaded yes. That `oh yes' at the end of the interview, that's authoritative, that's the voice of a leader. MARGARET stares at him."
margaret,"It's all very well to talk about changing my voice, Mr Reece, but for some of my colleagues to imagine me as their leader would be like imagining, I don't know, being led into battle by their chambermaid. It's my background, and my sex. No matter how I've tried, and I have tried, to fit in, I will never be truly one of them. Both REECE and NEAVE are aware that she has spoken very nakedly - and is thus extremely vulnerable. REECE If I may say so - I think that's your trump card. You're flying in the face of everything the Tories have been thus far. It's really very exciting. One simply has to maximise your appeal, bring out all your qualities and make you look, and sound, like the leader that you could be."
neave,You've got it in you to go the whole distance.
reece,Absolutely.
margaret,"Prime Minister?! Oh no. Oh no no no. In Britain? There will be no female Prime Minister here, not in my lifetime. No. And I told Airey, I don't expect to win the leadership, but I am going to run. Just to shake up the party. NEAVE moves in intently- NEAVE Respectfully, Margaret, I disagree. If you want to change this party, lead it. If you want to change the country, lead it. What we're talking about here today is surface. What's crucial is that you hold your course, and stay true to who you are. Never be anything other than yourself. MARGARET, though flattered, looks sceptical."
reece,"Leave us to do the rest. A BEAT MARGARET Gentlemen, I am in your hands. I may be persuaded to surrender the hat. But the pearls were a gift from my husband on the birth of our twins and they are absolutely non-negotiable. MARGARET smiles at them."
margaret,Maaaaaaaaaaaa.
margaret, Denis.
margaret,You are the backbone of our nation! Small firms like Loveday's Ice Cream. How are you? So nice to meet you ladies.
margaret,It has to be something icy on a stick for Denis.
margaret,Oh Airey...
announcer,"The leader of the Conservative Party, Margaret Thatcher! MARGARET pushes back her shoulders and walks into battle to the sound of GROWING APPLAUSE."
neave,Good night Margaret. My money's on the filly to win!
margaret,"Oh, thanks Airey. Goodnight."
margaret,"Now, as the test draws near, I ask your help. That together we can shake off the shackles of socialism and restore to greatness this country that we love so much. And the only way is for the Conservative Party to win!"
51,"NEW READER 3  The bonus of one of the most famous addresses in the world, Number 10 Downing Street."
denis,"This is it, steady the buffs old girl."
margaret,"I should just like to say that I take very seriously the trust the British people placed in me today, and I will work hard every day to live up to that responsibility. And now, I should like to share with you a prayer of St Francis of Assisi: Where there is discord may we bring harmony... Where there is error may we bring truth... Where there is doubt may we bring faith... Where there is despair may we bring hope.."
margaret,"Shoulders back, tummies in!"
margaret,I'm perfectly healthy. There's no need for any of this.
denis,"Just let them look under the bonnet, MT. Check everything is hunky dory."
margaret,Really it's becoming quite tiresome.
denis,What is?
margaret,You.  I was on my own for twenty four years before I met you and I can manage perfectly well without you now. So will you please go away and stop bothering me.
margaret,No
doctor,"Hallucinations? MARGARET hesitates. She shakes her head. MARGARET No. DOCTOR Sleep? MARGARET Yes, I sleep. Four, five hours a night. DOCTOR So you wake early? MARGARET And I stay up late. I always have. She looks at him as if he really should know this about her. The DOCTOR notes this down. DOCTOR We just want to keep abreast of it. MARGARET Yes. Of course. DOCTOR Grief is a very natural state. MARGARET My husband has been gone for years. Cancer. DOCTOR Carol says you've decided to let his things go. Probably a good thing. MARGARET Yes. It was my idea. To Oxfam. Perfectly good stuff. People can use these things."
doctor,"Still it must be a bit disorientating. You are bound to be feeling. MARGARET What? What am I `bound to be feeling'? The DOCTOR looks up from his note taking, hearing the quiet challenge in MARGARET's voice. MARGARET  Oh, do please answer that."
dennis oov,"Steady, steady, steady! Damn. Fore!"
margaret,"Enough. Denis, enough!"
denis, Dismissed!
denis,"You know, it's a marvel to me that you can still quote huge chunks of Kipling but try remembering the name of that woman who's just made you that godawful cold collation... No? Come on... you can do it... month of the year... one syllable... rhymes with moon ... MARGARET  June. MARGARET turns to DENIS, a quiet appalling victory. DENIS June! Bingo. Knew you'd get there in the end. ""When the Himalayan peasant meets the he-bear in his pride, He shouts to scare the monster, who will often turn aside, but the she-bear thus accosted rends the peasant tooth and nail. For the female of the species is more deadly than the male..."" As he continues, MARGARET reaches for the remote, turns the television on. She moves onto the radio. Then the stereo. She moves on, talking to herself- A gradual growing cacophony of sound-"
margaret,If I can't hear you then I can't see you. And if I can't see you then you are not here. MARGARET closes her eyes.
foot vo,"Less than two years ago, the Prime Minister quoted St. Francis and talked about bringing faith, hope and harmony to this country. MARGARET suddenly reaches out a hand, her hand shaking- MARGARET Denis? She turns in bed. Sudden panic, DENIS is gone-"
foot,"Can the Right Honourable Lady deny, that having brought about the highest level of unemployment since 1934-"
protestors,Maggie Maggie Maggie! Out Out Out! Maggie Maggie Maggie! Out Out Out!
protestor 1,"You're supposed to be a mother! You're not a mother, you're s monster! You're a monster!"
heseltine,"May we have a word, Prime Minister?"
margaret,"Yes, but in order to arrive at the palace on time, Geoffrey and I are will be walking out of that door in 15 minutes. As you can see -"
heseltine,"I know you're running late Margaret, but we have to address this situation in light of tomorrow's blistering press coverage. Blistering! The knives are out. Your draft budget's been leaked, Geoffrey, they are baying for our blood!"
howe,Michael we can't possibly buckle at the first sign of difficulty.
heseltine,No one is saying we have to buckle.
prior,But is this really the time to make these spending cuts in the middle of one of the deepest recessions this country has ever experienced?
hestletine,"We need a plan of action, Margaret."
pym,Absolutely. A strategy.
gilmour,We must be armed.
prior,Agreed.
margaret,Really.  How much is a pack of Lurpak?
pym,Lurpak?
margaret,"Butter, Francis.  Forty two pence. Anchor butter is forty pence. Flora margarine, still the cheapest, is thirty eight pence. I can assure you I am not out of touch."
gilmour,"Nothing. Nothing, Prime Minister."
margaret,"Don't try to hide you opinions. Goodness me, I'd much rather you were honest and straightforward about them - instead of continuously and damagingly leaking them to the press. Well?"
pym,"Well, people can't pay their mortgages."
gilmour,The manufacturing industry is practically on its knees.
pym,"Honest, hard-working, decent people are losing their homes. It's terribly shameful."
gilmour,"The point is, Prime Minister, that we must moderate the pace -"
heseltine,- if we're even to have a hope of winning the next election-
pym,Quite right.
margaret,"Ah. Worried about our careers, are we?"
64,MARGARET  The people of this country chose us because they believe we can restore the health of the British economy and we will do just that! Barring a failure of nerve.
howe,You can't close down a discussion because it's not what you wish to hear.
margaret,I don't expect everyone just to sit there and agree with me. But what kind of leader am I if I don't try to get my own way - to do what I know to be right.
howe,"Yes. But Margaret, one must be careful of testing one's colleagues' loyalty too far."
margaret,"But we shall never give in to them. We shall never waver, not for a second, in our determination to see this country prosper once again."
margaret,"And now, it must be business as usual."
denis,"Come on love, get to bed. I don't know why you do this to yourself every year, it's a speech at conference, not the Magna Carta!"
margaret,"I know, I'm coming DT. Nearly there -"
denis,My shoes!
margaret," Mark?... Hello darling... No, I'm fine... I'm very well..."
margaret,That was Mark. Not able to come.
denis, Boy's always going AWOL.
margaret,Well it costs him a great deal to fly everyone up here.
denis,"There you go, making excuses for him. Now look where it's got you."
margaret,"Yes. He moved to Paris when he was fourteen. He played the King of Siam 4,625 times on the London and Broadway stages. What are you doing?"
denis, One likes to make an effort. A snifter?
margaret,"You're dead, Denis."
denis,"Ah. Well, if I'm dead... who are you talking to? Shall we dance ?"
margaret,"Gentlemen, the Argentinian Junta - which is a fascist gang - has invaded our sovereign territory. This cannot be tolerated. May I make plain my negotiating position. I will not negotiate with criminals or thugs. The Falkland islands belong to Britain, and I want them back. Gentlemen, I need you to tell me today if that is possible."
admiral leach,"Possible... just, Prime Minister. We can have a Task Force ready to sail in forty-eight hours."
margaret,Forty-eight hours?
admiral leach,But -
margaret,But?
admiral leach,"We have a very narrow weather window. We can't fight in winter down there. Nobody can. If we are going, we have to go now."
margaret,Why were the islands left without any naval protection?
john nott,In the last round of Defence cuts we judged the risk of invasion to be small.
margaret,Did we?
john nott,"And if you remember, Prime Minister, you agreed that we should reduce the naval presence in the area to an absolute minimum."
howe,"Margaret, the cost of sending 28,000 men and a hundred ships twelve thousand miles, almost to Argentina, will be absolutely crippling."
margaret,"I don't think we should be worrying about money at this point, Geoffrey."
geoffrey howe,We can't afford to go to war.
mp 1,"The U.S. Secretary of State has arrived, Prime Minister."
general haig,"So you are proposing to go to war over these Islands. They're thousands of miles away, a handful of citizens, politically and economically... insignificant, if you'll excuse me -"
margaret,"Just like Hawaii, I imagine."
general haig,I'm sorry?
margaret,"1941, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbour. Did America go cap in hand and ask Tojo for a peaceful negotiation of terms? Did she turn her back on her own citizens there because the islands were thousands of miles from mainland United States? No, no, no! We will stand on principle or we shall not stand at all."
general haig,But Margaret with all due respect when one has been to war....
margaret,"With all due respect sir, I have done battle every single day of my life, and many men have underestimated me before. This lot seem bound to do the same but they will rue the day."
margaret,Is this ship a threat?
admiral fieldhouse,"Both of these ships are carrying Exocet missiles, Prime Minister. Just yesterday they launched- then aborted- an attack inside the exclusion zone. There is a risk they could try it again."
francis pym,The Belgrano is sailing directly away from the islands. Can it really be regarded as a threat ?
admiral fieldhouse,She's been changing course continually. There's a strong possibility that they're attempting a pincer movement on our carrier group. 
74,ADMIRAL FIELDHOUSE  I advise that we engage them: hit the Belgrano as a warning to the others. Send them all back to port.
francis pym,It'll play badly internationally. We'll be seen as aggressors.
john nott,"This will be an escalation, Prime Minister."
leach,"If there is to be an escalation, it's better that we start it."
minister,"It is steaming away, Prime Minister."
margaret,Sink it.
john nott,Prime Minister -
margaret, I must write to them.
john nott,Prime Minister?
margaret,The families. I must write to them...
margaret,Foreign Secretary...
pym,I've just been briefed by Admiral Fieldhouse. 
76,"PYM  He told me bluntly that if the Argentinians are prepared and willing to risk their aircraft, they have enough missiles to cripple most of our fleet."
john nott,President Reagan and President Bellaunde of Peru have some new proposals for the peace plan -
margaret," The peace plan? There will be no appeasement. This is a war. A war they started and by God, we will finish. Shall I tell you what I'm going to write to every single one of these families, these heartbroken families? I am going to tell them that no British soldier will die in vain for the Falklands."
military voice,Lieutenant Colonel Jones. Captain Wood. Captain Dench. Lieutenant Farlaine. Corporal Hardman. Corporal Sullivan. Corporal Briar.
radio vo,"Shortly after dark last night, our forces executed what our Commander in Chief has called a brilliant surprise night attack."
denis,"Thatcher, bed."
radio,"From their new positions, our forces can see large numbers of Argentine soldiers retreating and streaming back into Port Stanley. Our forces are moving forward to exploit their success."
margaret,"We were faced with an act of unprovoked aggression and we responded as we have responded in times past: with unity, strength and courage, sure in the knowledge that though much is sacrificed, in the end, right will prevail over wrong."
denis,"GOTCHA! Well that paid off old girl! Your ratings soared! From the most hated Prime Minister of all time to the nation's darling...The world was at your feet, and Britain was back in business!"
news reader,The Berlin Wall has fallen. The gates have opened! The police are making no attempt to stop people as they go through.
margaret,I don't agree in any measure!
geoffrey howe,But Prime Minister the question of the European single currency will come up.
margaret,I don't think the country is ready for it yet.
geoffrey howe,But we cannot bury our heads in the sand...
news journalist,"- that there must be a change in that style of management. That Mrs Thatcher must listen more, and on occasion, give in."
margaret,There it is again! Why not?
minister 1,Because -
minister 2,Because people... on the whole... think that the tax is manifestly unfair.
margaret,"Nonsense. Arrant nonsense. This is a simple proposition. In order to live in this country, you must pay for the privilege- something, anything! If you pay nothing, you care nothing. What do you care where you throw your rubbish? Your council estate is a mess, your town, graffiti, what do you care? It's not your problem , it's somebody else's problem- it's the government's problem! YOUR problem is, some of you, is that you haven't got the courage for this fight. You haven't had to fight hard for anything. It's all been given to you- and you feel guilty about it! Well, may I say, on behalf of all those who HAVE had to fight their way up,  we resent those slackers who take, take, take, and contribute nothing to the community!"
82,MARGARET  And why have we not made more progress to date? What is that? Is that the timetable? I haven't seen that. May I see it?
howe,"Here it is, Prime Minister. Of course."
margaret,"The wording is sloppy here, and here."
howe,If you say so.
margaret,I do say so.
howe,It's merely a first draft...
margaret,"This is ridiculous. There are two ""T's"" in ""committee""!"
83,"MARGARET  As the Lord President has come to cabinet unprepared, I am obliged to close this meeting."
angry crowd," Can't pay, won't pay! Can't pay, won't pay! Can't pay, won't pay!"
protestors,Out... Out... Out...
protestors,Maggie... Maggie... Maggie. Out... out... out. With a WHOOSH of flames the north side of Piccadilly Circus goes up in flames. Smoke and blood and fire everywhere.
margaret,Geoffrey- GEOFFREY My letter of resignation. HOWE slides a letter down on her desk- MARGARET looks down at the thick envelope. SILENCE
geoffrey howe,"Our differences, I'm afraid, cannot be reconciled. MARGARET resumes working- HOWE waits and waits and waits- The SCRATCH of MARGARET's pen, she works on, refusing to stop for him."
