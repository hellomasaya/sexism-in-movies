Speaker,Dialogue
rick,"Pull over, man!"
fred,"No way, I can out-run 'em!"
rick,No you can't--not in this thing! Another POLICE CRUISER FISHTAILS OUT OF A SIDE STREET and
fred,I don't care--I'm not stopping 'til we get there!
rick,Are you crazy?!
fred,"Yeah, I'm crazy! I'm crazy about my wife!"
rick,"Hear me out, gentlemen, I can explain every--! AS A BURLY OFFICER'S HEAD CONNECTS WITH RICK'S CHEST, we..."
rick,I still have a few.
gunnar,Where? Rick shoots him a look.
rick,They're hidden. BACK ON TV SCREEN - A PRETTY GIRL with a knockout body comes up and puts her arms around Rick.
emma,Who's that girl?
rick,That's Mommy.
emma,"No, I mean the young one standing next to you."
rick,That's Mommy.
emma,Mommy used to have long hair? And she wore a bikini?
emma,How come she doesn't wear a bikini anymore?
gunnar,Is it because of her fat ass?
rick,I guess. What? No. Who said Mommy's got a fat ass?
gunnar,Mommy.
rick,"Well, uh, I don't appreciate that language, Gunnar. You've got the best mom in the whole world--don't ever say anything bad about her. Just then, MAGGIE comes GRUNTING into the room carrying a ONE- YEAR-OLD BABY in one arm and a basket of laundry in the other. She's in her late-30's, cute, with short, manageable mommy hair. She's wearing SWEATPANTS, an OVERSIZED T-SHIRT, and NO MAKE-UP."
maggie,"I know, I know, I'm trying."
rick,Well how long you gonna be?
maggie,"Forty-five minutes--sooner if you help with the kids. Maggie looks to him, hopeful."
rick,I miss going out with you on Saturday nights. She smiles at him.
maggie,"I know, it's just like the old days. Rick pulls Maggie close as they walk."
rick,Maybe we should make a rule that we go out at least six nights a week without the kids. Maggie GIGGLES.
maggie,You gotta be kidding me? Maggie pulls away.
rick,What?
maggie,You just checked out that girl's butt.
rick,I did?
maggie,"Yeah, you did, and it's rude."
rick,Why? You think she saw me?
maggie,saw you.
rick,"Oh, uh, yeah. I'm sorry, honey, I'm just kind of spacey today."
maggie,"Grace, let me ask you something: Does Fred ever check out other women in front of you?"
grace,"No, Fred's not a gawker. Grace pats a pleased-looking Fred on the head."
grace,Dr. Lucy! Congratulations!
maggie,Are you kidding me? You're the only friend of ours who ever got an award--you think we're going to miss that? ANGLE ON Rick and Fred standing at the bar.
fred,"Do you mind telling me how your wife catches you checking out another girl? What is this, amateur hour?"
rick,The girl walked past and I glanced back at her for like half a second.
fred,"There's your problem, dumb-ass-- it's the wrong order. You don't wait for the girl to walk past and then glance back. You turn when she's still fifteen feet in front of you...then you wait for her to walk into your line of vision. Fred NOTICES an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN walking toward them from the right."
missy, Don't forget to mingle! The guys watch Missy walk away.
fred,Wow. Missy's looking pretty good for someone going through a divorce.
rick,"Yeah, that's rough stuff--I heard they might have to sell the house."
fred,Too bad. You gonna hit 'em up for the listing?
rick,"What am I, a vulture? Nah, I don't go after the divorcee business unless they approach me first."
fred,"Yeah, it's kind of tacky, huh? As the guys crane their necks to get a better view of Missy's ass, we... REVERSE ANGLE to reveal Maggie, Grace and Dr. Lucy sipping lemondrops and watching Rick and Fred from across the room."
grace,"Look at those two meatheads checking out Missy Frankenfield. What, do they think they're invisible over there?"
maggie,I thought you said Fred wasn't a gawker.
grace,He was standing right next to you. I can't let him know that I know-- that would take all the fun out of it.
rick,How about I drive the babysitter home while you go upstairs and prepare the altar? He puts his arm around her as they walk toward the front door.
maggie,"I want to, honey, but I've got to get up early with the kids."
rick,I'll get up with the kids.
maggie,But I have to go out and buy a gift- -they're going to a birthday party tomorrow.
rick,"I'll cjet the gift, then I'll take the kids to the park, then to the party. You can dust stay in bed,, get your beauty sleep, and bask in the sweet, sweet pounding I'm about to give you."
maggie,I love it when you sweet-talk me. Maggie smiles but as Rick opens the front door they FREEZE IN
gunnar,Mommy! Daddy!
rick,How were the kids tonight?
paige,Perfect. That Gunnar is so cute-- all he wants to do is wrestle with me. Rick smiles at this.
rick,"Oh, uh, sure, I'm sorry. Flustered, he moves to the temperature control which in LARGE ILLUMINATED DIGITAL TYPE reads: 69!!! He quickly PUNCHES THE A/C OFF, then trains his eyes straight ahead and grips the steering wheel tight at ten-and-two."
paige,Thank you.
rick,'Welcome.
paige,"Mr. Mills, can I ask you something?"
rick,Sure.
paige,I was wondering...
rick,Buy you some.. .How old are you?
paige,Twenty. But I'm turning twenty-one next week.
rick,Oh. Happy birthday. That's a biggie.
paige,"Yeah. My aunt usually buys beer for me, but she's out of town."
rick,"Uh, I don't know, Paige...I could get in a lot of trouble for giving alcohol to a minor."
paige,"Oh, come on, I'm a junior in college. You drank when you were in college, didn't you?"
rick,"Well, uh..."
paige,"Besides, it's so arbitrary. How does it make sense that twenty's old enough to fight in Iraq or watch a porno movie, but it's too young to drink a beer? Rick shifts in his seat."
rick,Really? Twenty's old enough to uh...?
paige,Fight in Iraq?
rick,"No, the other thing."
paige,"Watch Porn? Oh, God yeah--half the girls in those things are my age. Rick catches a hint of cleavage, a flash of leg."
rick,"I'm sorry, Paige, I can't do that."
paige,Why not?
rick,"Well... it would be.. .inappropriate. Rick's voice has taken on a firmer, more adult tone. Paige seems amused by it."
paige,"What, is that your grown-up voice?"
rick,"No, Paige.  What are you thinking? I'm a married man and I have a family. You think they'd like it if they knew I was hanging out at the lake, all alone, drinking beer with a college girl?"
rick,"All right, better get inside. She opens the car door, then glares back at him."
paige,Ewww. What the hell were you thinking?
rick,"Go ahead. Scoot along now. As she SLAMS the car door, we..."
maggie,Shhhh. He just fell asleep.
rick,Awesome. Rick playfully pinches Maggie's butt as he follows her into their bedroom where...
emma,Can I sleep with you tonight?
rick,No.
emma,Please.
rick,"No. Absolutely not. Maggie, clearly softening to the idea, shrugs at Rick."
emma,"Well.. .can someone read me a story? Rick looks at Maggie, then at his daughter."
rick,"Okay, one quick story. Come on, jump on my back. Emma jumps on Rick's back."
rick,"Okay, honey, this is the last pony and then night-night. Emma finishes putting on a rubberband, then looks at him, satisfied."
emma,"There. You look pretty, Daddy."
rick,"Okay, now give me a kiss, hug and go to sleep. She lays back on her pillow. Rick gives her a big kiss on both cheeks."
emma,"I love you, too, Daddy."
rick,"No. Please, no. Rick wants to wake her up but sees that she needs the sleep, so he just PULLS THE COVERS OVER HER SHOULDERS. As Rick walks around the bed and INTO THE BATHROOM in the b.g., we HOLD ON MAGGIE until she OPENS HER EYES. She listens to her husband brush his teeth with perhaps a tinge of GUILT, and when he shuts off the faucet, she CLOSES HER EYES AGAIN, and we..."
fred,Hey.
rick,Hey. How'd you make out?
fred,Great. Lost both sets.
rick,So'd you get the business? Fred nods and wipes his brow.
fred,Pretty sure I got the Auto and Home. He told me to call his accountant on Monday about the Life.
rick,Nice. Fred looks around at all the pretty MOMS and NANNIES with their CHILDREN.
fred,Can you believe the talent here today?
fred,Ouch.
rick,"CPR girl's back, too. Rick nods toward A PIG-TAILED PARAMEDIC, early 30's, TEACHING A CPR CLASS. The two men look on solemnly."
fred,Imagine if we were coming here back when we were single?
emma,Monkey bars! The kids JUMP off the swings and RUN for the jungle gym.
gunnar,Me first! Rick trails them like a Sherpa carrying a couple Razor scooters and a basketball as Fred tags along. They shlep past THE TRI-DELTA SORORITY playing ultimate frisbee and
fred,So you get lucky last night?
rick,"Nah, the kids were up when we got home. How 'bout you?"
fred,"Well, kinda lucky. Grace conked right out so I snuck out to the car and rubbed one out. Rick shoots Fred a look."
rick,The car? What are you Knight Rider? Why didn't you just go in the bathroom like a normal guy?
fred,"And get caught by Grace? Can't risk it. Besides, cars turn me on--it's where I lost my virginity. And they're comfy--I just put the seat back and turn on the tunes. The guys sit on a bench."
rick,That's one of the things they don't tell you when you're young--that you'll still be jerking-off after you get married. I thought it was dust gonna be a teenage thing.
fred,"Yeah, I didn't see that one coming. The two men sit in silence for a LONG BEAT as the Frisbee Girls play all around them."
rick,What?
fred,The arch.
rick,What arch?
fred,"You know when you're taking a girl's panties off for the first time, and you're wondering if she's going to stop you, but then she gives you that little pelvic arch- thrust that tells you that the struggle's over, everything's going to be okay? Rick SIGHS."
rick,That's a happy moment.
fred,Yep. Another thing gone forever. Rick looks at his watch.
rick,"I should get going, I have to drop the kids off at a birthday party."
fred,You want to grab a coffee after?
rick,Do you have any interest in going down to the Patriot's training camp one of these days?
fred,"Are you kidding, I'd love that. Except...I always feel kind of pathetic waiting in line for Tom Brady's autograph."
rick,"Fred, I was planning on bringing the kids."
fred,Genius! That's the perfect cover! Rick shoots him a look then REACTS to something O.S.
rick,"Uh-oh... HIS POV - SLO-MO of a BEAUTIFUL GIRL walking toward him. Her straight brown hair shimmers.. .her blue eyes twinkle.. .her white uniformed blouse is unbuttoned enough to reveal a tasteful amount of CLEAVAGE. This is COFFEE GIRL, 23, granola, fresh, Australian, spacey. BACK ON THE GUYS staring in awe."
fred,Did you see her face? Her face is tremendous.
rick," Please don't have a nice ass, please don't have a nice ass... But as she turns to pour a cup of coffee, we see that HER ASS IS SPECTACULAR. Rick turns away, annoyed."
fred,I know. She's from Australia. Been working here about a month.
rick,Why'd you have to bring me here?!
fred,"Okay, cool it, tiger--here she comes. Coffee Girl steps up to the counter and smiles at Fred."
coffee girl," Hey, Old Navy, you like a muffin with that?"
rick,"Uh, sure. What do you recommend?"
coffee girl,They're all good. The Wannabe Artist-Type steps protectively up beside Coffee Girl.
wannabe,"I'd go with the bran muffin--you guys are probably having digestive issues at your age, right? Rick flinches at this, then turns to Coffee Girl."
rick,I'll have a blueberry muffin please.
fred,"Make it a bran muffin for me. Rick shoots Fred a look, clearly annoyed. As Coffee Girl turns to get their order, we go to..."
rick,"Did you notice she's from Cleavage, Ohio?"
fred,Yeah. I bet her areolas look like a couple of pepperoni slices. Fred trains his eyes back on Coffee Girl and SQUINTS
rick,What the hell are you doing?
fred,Shh. I'm taking a mental photograph for my spank bank.
rick,"Oh, hey, Ed. Didn't see you there."
ed,That's because you were shooting laser beams at the java babe.
rick,"Well, no, we were just--"
ed,"Come on, gentlemen, you're married men and she's half your age--grow"
rick,Hm?
ed,This Saturday afternoon at the new casa--we're inally in and we're having a little celebration.
rick,"Oh, I don't know if we can--"
ed,Your wives already RSVP'd.
rick,Right on.
ed,'Til then. Ed HOLDS OUT HIS FIST to them.
rick,He's right though. Fred looks at Rick.
fred,"I don't see what the big deal is-- we're not hurting anyone. What is he Big Brother--he's gonna tell me what I can look at now? For God sakes, don't take that away from me- -it's all I got! As Rick thinks about this, we..."
baker,"Rick, you open. Rick takes a fresh DOLLAR BILL off the pile in front of him and STUDIES THE SERIAL NUMBERS."
rick,Four 9's.
fred,"Hey, where's Coakley? How come he didn't show?"
gary,Vegas. Hawaiian Tropic finals. The guys nod their approval.
baker,"Man, imagine being Coakley? The guy's single, he's loaded, chicks love him, he doesn't have to answer to anybody."
gary,That's the life.
fred,That is the life.
gary,How's it possible to know that my wife won't find out?
flats,But would I still have memory of it?
gary,Oof. I think I'd pay 500 bucks for that. Baker shoots him a look.
baker,"You cheap,bastard. We're talking about an investment that gets your rocks off and protects your wife's feelings. I'd pay five grand."
rick,Wow.
gary,"Well, excuse me, Mr. Wall Street, but us public school teachers aren't getting any of that bail-out money you're over-tipping everyone with. Just then, the front door OPENS and Maggie ENTERS."
maggie,"Hey, guys."
rick,"Oh, hey, honey. How was the book club?"
maggie,Great.
fred,What did you guys read this month?
maggie,Hemingway.
gary,Old Man and the Sea?
maggie,"No, Muriel's yoga book. The guys LAUGH."
rick,"Gunnar and Emma stalled for a while, but they weren't bad."
maggie,How about the baby? Rick points to the BABY MONITOR in the middle of the table.
rick,Not a peep.
maggie,"Great job. Now win some money, honey. She kisses Rick and walks out of the room."
gary,I wish I could drink tequila. It's a great buzz but it always gives me the spins and then I have to go home early.
fred,You want to know a sure cure for the spins? Fred puts a hand over his right eye.
rick,Or you could find a nice 12-step program.
maggie,"Oh, you poor thing... She hurries to the Baby and PICKS HIM UP."
baker,"Pfttt. Hog-head, your ass doesn't have seven-five. More LAUGHTER from the guys as Rick deals out fresh bills."
flats,"So what's your number, Rick?"
rick,"Oh jeez, Flats, I don't know..."
fred,"Come on.. any girl you choose. You get to do anything you want with her, and your wife will never find out. It's completely harmless, a one-time thing--what would you pay for that? BACK ON MAGGIE as she cradles her baby and LEANS CLOSER to the monitor."
maggie,What wouldn't you pay?!
rick,"I didn't really mean it, honey.  They kind of put me on the spot. Look, some of the other guys were throwing out some pretty hefty bids."
maggie,What does that have to do with anything?
rick,"Well... I'm the host of the party, I didn't want to be a buzz-kill."
maggie,How is having sex with a hooker protecting me and the kids?
rick,No one said anything about hookers.
maggie,You were paying for sex--what would you call her?
grace,Fred said five grand? What a blowhard!
maggie,You know what's even funnier? Hog- head McCormick said he'd pay seven grand.
grace,What?! That bum hasn't worked since the dot-com bust--his wife supports him! The girls LAUGH.
maggie,Sometimes I wonder if it would be better if they did cheat and get it over with.
grace,A what?
maggie,Wait a minute. . .Are you saying let them go out and cheat?
grace,That's Fred. He thinks because he sees big tits everywhere and then still comes home for dinner that I should be welcoming him at the door like some conquering hero. Dr. Lucy smiles.
maggie,Wow. You're talking about the nuclear option. Maggie ponders the idea.
grace,"And remind me again, what good could possibly come from this...?"
maggie,You're telling us you let Charlie sleep with another woman? Dr. Lucy takes a moment before answering.
grace,And...?
grace,"I don't know. There's a reason that men evolved and apes didn't. It's because women demanded more. Without a wife, Einstein would've been humping a maple tree all day. As the women LAUGH, we"
grace,There he is! The lord of the manor!
ed,"Come on, everyone in the shack! The grand tour's about to begin!"
ed,"I call it headquarters. LARRY BOHAC, mid-40's, and his blonde bombshell of a wife, MANDY,  look around in awe."
mandy,Un-believable.
ed,"That's sweet of you to say, Mandy."
larry,"It's epic, Ed. Ed points to one wall which houses a GLASSED-IN HUMIDOR."
kimmy,"Wait a second, Ed, first I want to show them Lny headquarters. Fred looks at Rick and rolls his eyes."
kimmy,It's my paradise.
ed,"With a price tag north of one hundred and forty large, it better be paradise. Ed holds out his fist and Rick obediently POUNDS IT. Just then Grace NOTICES that Fred has disappeared."
grace,"Hey, where did Fred go? Rick turns and sees that he's missing."
rick,What are you doing?
fred,I can't take these look-at-how-much- I-own parties. It's obnoxious. Rick nods and sits down beside him.
rick,"Well, kind of. You made me drive around town with you for two hours, remember?"
rick,Why'd you have to hook your boat up to it?
fred,"Because it's the Touring Edition, numb-skull. The thing can tow more weight than ninety percent of the pick-ups out there!"
kimmy,"The mantle actually came all the way from Tuscany, which is in Europe."
ed,"Hey, gang, check this out."
kimmy,"Oh God, Eddie, they don't need to see that--they'll think we're wackos. Ed PUNCHES A CODE into a keypad and the WALL SLIDES OPEN revealing a SAFE ROOM."
maggie,Oh my God... this is like secret agent stuff.
kimmy,"I think having a safe room is a bit over the top, but Ed feels with our two little ones you can never be too cautious."
grace,"Aw, you're such a good daddy."
maggie, Rick can't even set up the baby monitors right. Ed points to a monitor where we see Rick and Fred ENTER the master bedroom.
ed,Here come Tweedle-dee and Tweedle- dum. CLOSE ON VIDEO MONITOR - we see Rick and Fred cross over to the master bathroom doorway and look in.
kimmy,They can't hear you. The room's completely soundproof.
ed,And bulletproof. ON VIDEO MONITOR WALL - we see Rick and Fred LEAVE ONE SCREEN and ENTER ANOTHER.
rick,They must've gone downstairs. Fred motions to Ed's humidor room.
grace,"Uh, maybe we should turn this off. But Ed turns THE VOLUME UP. CLOSE ON MONITOR - Rick plays along with a BAD BRITISH"
grace, Here we go...
rick,"Hey, speaking of installations, is that a shiny new set of cans on Mandy Bohac?"
fred,Either that or she's wearing her daughter's t-shirt.
rick,They look good but I'll still take the real deal any day.
fred,Right. You're telling me you'd take Kimmy Long's flapjacks over Mandy's new speedbags?
rick,That's what I'm telling you. I like boobs with a little mileage on 'em. They're more fun.
fred,Fun?
rick,"Yeah. You can smoosh 'em, swing 'em, hump 'em, Stretch-Armstrong 'em."
fred,And what about the proven correlation between floppy boobs and large-mouth vaginas?
kimmy,You people are horrible! Horrible!
fred,"Uh, anyone thinking chocolate chip cookie dough in a waffle cone? Grace YANKS the mini-van to the side of the road and GLARES"
grace,"Large-mouth vaginas?! As the guys cower, we"
maggie,"You know what really troubles me? The thing that you're all so obsessed with is meaningless to you. It's really just about numbers with you guys. Rick looks up, confused."
rick,"Well, virginity is different for guys."
maggie,"The point is, obviously I like sex, too--it means something to me--but I don't walk around gawking at every guy I see."
rick,"All right, so I occasionally notice other women. I'm sorry."
maggie,Occasionally? Rick rakes his hands through his hair and decides to come clean.
rick,"Okay, you want the truth? You really want me to pull back the curtain here? From the moment I leave the house in the morning 'til the moment I get home, I pretty much notice every woman in my path. Maggie turns to face him."
rick,"No. Of course I'm happy, honey--our sex life is great--not that I wouldn't mind a little more, but-- look, one thing has nothing to do with the other. I think about sex a lot--all guys do--that's just the way it is. Maggie sits down beside him, clearly at the end of her rope. No one speaks for a few moments. Then:"
maggie,I'm giving you a hall pass.
rick,A what?
maggie,One week off from marriage.
rick,"You mean, like a trial separation? You are seriously overreacting."
maggie,"It's not a separation, it's a hall pass. You can do whatever you want. Get it out of your system."
maggie,"It's not a yes or no offer, and it's not a debate. You're getting a hall pass. As Maggie heads upstairs, we PUSH IN on a confused Rick."
rick,'Morning.
maggie, There's a couple hard-boiled eggs in a bowl there for you.
rick,"I'm gonna have to take them to go, hon, I've got a showing in fifteen minutes. Rick puts the eggs in his pocket, then approaches Maggie and kisses her on the cheek."
maggie,"I told you, this isn't negotiable. She turns and faces him."
rick,You're really serious about this?
maggie,"Rick, this isn't something that I...look, I really think you need this. I think we need this. Rick doesn't know what to say."
rick,For how long?
maggie,"We'll be back in one week. And as far as I'm concerned, starting right now. .. you have the week off from marriage."
rick,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
fred,I called your office and they told me you were in the neighborhood. Rick turns to the couple.
rick,"Oh, this is a friend of mine, Fred Searing. Fred, this is Harold and Nancy Goldberg--they're moving up here from Long Island."
fred,"Well, mazel tov, folks. The Goldbergs look at Fred a little warily as he takes out a card."
harold goldberg,We're good on insurance. Rick quickly jumps in.
rick," Uh, why don't you two take another look around and if you have any questions I'll be right here."
harold goldberg,Thank you. The Goldbergs walk out and Rick closes the door behind them.
fred,You weren't picking up your cell--I wanted to see how much trouble you got in last night. You know what Grace made me do? She made me call the Longs and apologize. Rick flinches.
rick,Oof .
fred,How 'bout you--did Maggie freak out when you got home?
rick,Uh... sort of. Rick peeks out the kitchen door to make sure the Goldberg's aren't listening. Then:
fred,A what?
rick,A week off from marriage to do whatever I want. She's going to her parents' house down the Cape 'til next Sunday. Fred SNICKERS.
fred,"Yeah, right."
rick,I'm serious.
fred,You're full of shit.
rick,"Fred, it's true. You think I could make something like this up? Fred stares at him."
fred,I don't get it--why aren't you more excited?
rick,Well...I don't know how I feel.
fred,About...?
rick,The hall pass. Something about it isn't right.
fred,"You mean, like, you think Maggie might have a brain tumor or something?"
rick,"No. I mean, just because my wife tells me it's okay to cheat... is it?"
fred,"Uh, yeah."
rick,"Yeah, but there's a part of me that's saying, 'Wow, you must have pushed her pretty hard to get her to this point.' And is that good for a marriage? That your wife is willing to try something this insane? Fred can't believe his ears."
fred,Absolutely!
rick,The oven's a GE.
fred,"It's a real gas oven! And what about you, huh? Come on, man, your wife is living her dreams.. .and now it's time for you to live yours. As Rick thinks about this, we"
fred,"I don't know, I think this is some very forward-thinking on Maggie's part."
grace,"Quit lobbying--you're not getting a hall pass. And you mark my words, this is going to end up biting Maggie in the ass. At the top of the stairs Fred puts his arms around her."
fred,Why would I need a hall pass? I've got you.
grace,Not tonight you don't. I'm too bloated and I have cramps.
fred,I don't mind.
grace,"Fred, do I have to spell it out for you? I'm having my period."
grace,"Come on, hon, give me a break. Not tonight. Disappointed, Fred watches her walk toward the bedroom."
grace,"Thank you, officers. Fred scurries into the house ahead of Grace. As soon as the door shuts, we HEAR:"
fred,I got a Hall Pass!
rick,How?
fred,"Doesn't matter how. I got one. Can you believe it?! I got a hall pass! Rick stands up, elated."
rick,And I've got a hall pass!
fred,We both have hall passes!
rick,When does yours start? Fred looks at his watch.
fred,Twenty-three minutes ago! She just left for the Cape--she's staying with Maggie. It's just you and me for the next six days!
rick,"Oh my God, do you realize how much easier this is going to make it-- having a hall pass partner?"
fred,"And it's not just me--Baker, Gary, and Hog-head are coming out with us tonight!"
rick,"No way?! They got hall passes, too?!"
fred,"No, no, no--they just want to watch. Rick grows concerned."
rick,"You think that's a good idea, letting them in on it? What if they blab and it gets around town--it might embarrass our wives."
fred,"Don't worry, I already talked to them. Their lips are sealed. Rick and Fred smile."
baker,"Hey, why are you staying at a hotel if your wives are out of town?"
fred,"Well, we can't very well take babes back to our places--if they know where we live they might end up stalking us."
rick,"Besides, I wouldn't be able to concentrate with all the pictures everywhere and the kids' cut-outs all over the fridge."
gary,"Yeah, isn't it weird how your own kids can creep you out sometimes? Rick shoots Gary a look."
fred,I get the feeling there's a lot of divorcees in this place.
gary,What about those two? Why don't you bang them?
fred,No way. They're doing the
gary,"Okay, how about the blonde hostess? Maybe somebody should nail her, huh?"
rick,"Attempt to be cool, Gary--we've got a whole week. Baker looks around at the lame bar scene."
baker,Are you guys sure that Applebee's is the best place to be picking up women?
rick,What are you thinking--Olive Garden?
gary,"Nah, that's only good on Thursday nights."
baker,Are you guys for real?
gary,Wait a second--where's Coakley? That's where we should be.
baker,He's in Iceland.
rick,What's he doing there?
baker,"What do you think he's doing there? The guys all nod at this, proud of him."
rick,"Look, before we go bagging any chicks, I gotta get a hunk of beef in me."
gary,"Hey, I got a guy over at Outback Steak House who could set us up."
baker,"Ooooh, he's got pull over at Outback. Wow."
rick,"Hey, I like Outback. Let's chug these and hit the road."
grace,I think we might've made a huge mistake.
maggie,"Stop thinking about it, Grace. Why don t you just try to get some sleep? Grace turns to Maggie."
grace,Sleep? I can't sleep. I don't understand you--how can you Just sit there and read knowing that Rick could be making out with a supermodel right now? Maggie doesn't answer.
maggie,Shh. You're going to wake the kids.
grace,Are you going to sit there and tell me you're not the least bit concerned about what they're doing right now? Maggie SIGHS.
maggie,Okay... I'm a little concerned.
grace,"We could've kept the status quo. I mean, were things really that bad that we had to try something this extreme?"
maggie,For me they were.
grace,You're kidding me? You've never done that? I do that all the time! Maggie almost smiles.
maggie,"Look, I understand that people have fantasies and that you're not always thinking about the person you're with."
grace,That's for sure.
maggie,But it's just...I don't know... it's been too long since I felt that he was thinking about me.
baker,Okay... so where to now? Rick can't think in this state.
rick,Fred...?
fred,Hm?
rick,Answer Baker.
fred,What's the question?
rick,What are we doing for the rest of the night?
baker,Now?
gary,Why don't you just back one out here?
baker,"Come on, you guys! I say we go to a strip club and smoke cigars-- that 11 wake us up!"
rick,I got a better idea. Rick STRETCHES.
baker,What?
rick,I say we tie a bow on it and put her to bed. This is gonna be a long week so we should pace ourselves. Baker looks at his watch.
baker,It's only nine-thirty!
fred,I'm with Rico.
rick,"Relax, guys, this is just the calm before the storm. Get out the plywood and batten down the hatches."
fred,"That's right. Tonight we build up strength, tomorrow we make landfall."
rick,"Too pricey. Besides, since we're paying for golf we get full access to the resort--including the pool bar."
fred,"Mothers, lock up your daughters-- the dogs are off the leash!"
rick,"Turn-and-burn, baby! Gary raises his hand for a HIGH-FIVE, but Rick balks."
rick,"Hoch-head, relax, the pool bar ain't going nowhere. Besides, it'll be good for us to get a little sun before making our grand entrance-- chicks love a healthy glow."
fred,"Plus it wouldn't hurt to work up a little sweat--get those pheromones flying. Just then, two sexy BEER-CART GIRLS wave as they pass."
gary,"Hey, guys, look what I brought. Gary holds up a ZIPLOCK BAG full of something chocolatey."
rick,What's that?
gary,"Pot brownskies. The guys all look at one another, baffled."
rick,"What, are we on spring break? Where the hell'd you get those?"
gary,I got an in.
fred,With who?
gary,Guy who washes my dog. Go ahead. He holds out the bag and the guys hesitate.
rick,"Hog-head, come on, who eats pot brownies at eleven in the morning when they're playing golf?"
gary,"And by the way, Rick, this is spring break! You've got a hall pass! Live it up, man! It'll probably help your rap with the ladies later."
rick,You don't even have a hall pass.
rick,It's not vicarious if you're actually doing it.
fred,"Oh, what the hell, it's not like my game can get any worse."
rick,"All right, give me one of those things. As Rick drops his club and walks toward the brownies, we"
fred,What kind of soap do you use?
fred,Yeah.
rick,Dove.
fred,"Yeah, I like Dove--it doesn't dry your skin so much. Fred stares into space."
rick,I think Hog-head's dead. Fred looks over and sees Hog-head SPRAWLED OUT ON HIS BACK IN A SAND TRAP. He's not moving.
ranger,What the hell is he doing? Rick and Fred grow visibly tense at the sight of an authority figure.
rick,"Uh, he's having back spasms."
ranger,Not him. Him. Rick and Fred turn and see Gary STANDING CHEST-DEEP in the MIDDLE OF A POND just STARING AT THEM.
gary,"I don't know--you tell me! Gary starts to LAUGH MANIACALLY. The Ranger turns to Rick, annoyed."
ranger,"Look, this is the third time I've had to flag your group and you're only on the fourth hole. Now if I have to come out here again, you're done for the day."
rick,"Gotcha. We'll pick it up, sir. The Ranger shoots them a look and DRIVES OFF toward the TWO ASIAN FOURSOMES waiting on the tee behind them."
rick,Think. Where did you last see it?
gary,On the course.
rick,Where on the course?
gary,"I don't know--on a fairway, I think. I clot out, grabbed my club, took a swing, and when I turned around it had disappeared."
rick,You're serious? You're telling us you lost your golf cart?
rick,"Shut up, Fred."
gary,"I didn't lose it, I think it was stolen."
gary,Criminals?
gary,"Look, all I know is I had it on the seventh tee and now it's gone."
rick,What are you talking about? We're only on the sixth hole.
gary,"What? Did we miss a hole? Where's my kids? Rick closes his eyes and rubs his head, trying to keep it together. Then he NOTICES something O.S.."
rick,"Oh, come on, man! ANOTHER ANGLE REVEALS Hog-head down in a greenside bunker PULLING UP HIS PANTS. As he starts to KICK SAND over his O.S. POOP like a cat in its litter box, we HEAR a noise and the guys look up. THEIR POV - the Golf Ranger comes flying over a hill heading straight for them."
fred,"Run for it! The guys run toward Rick's cart, jump in, and take off. Rick and Fred are in the seats, while Gary and Hog-head HANG OFF THE BACK. The cart BARRELS down a cart path with the Ranger"
gary,He's gaining on us!
rick,"I can't go any faster, I've got it floored!"
fred,"Cut through the woods! Without slowing down, Rick TURNS SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT and Gary and Hog-head TUMBLE OUT OF THE CART. With panic etched across their sweaty faces, Gary and Hog- head quickly jump to their feet and run after the cart. Rick slows just enough for them to catch up and jump back on, then he speeds down a maintenance path and DISAPPEARS INTO THE"
fred,"Ed. Kimmy. Clones. The light changes and as the golf cart DRIVES OFF through the busy intersection, we go BACK ON ED AND KIMMY shaking their heads."
kimmy,Their poor wives.
gerry,"Hey, I'm Gerry--thanks for coming out and supporting us."
maggie,"Oh, it was fun. You guys looked good."
gerry,Thanks. Gerry glances back at his TEAMMATES who are clearly egging him on.
maggie,"No, they're my kids."
maggie,Uh-huh. A couple other PLAYERS amble over.
gerry,"Dudes, they're not nannies, they're mommies."
grace,"Well, she is, not me. I'm not old enough yet. Maggie and the players LAUGH."
maggie's father,"Maggie, Grace, this is Rick Coleman- -the coach. Rick Coleman is a granite-jawed 38-year-old with a good head of hair and an easy-going manner."
rick coleman,I hope those clowns weren't bothering you.
maggie,"Oh, no, they were sweet."
grace,Yeah. Cute kids.
maggie,So you're the guy who's been taking money off my dad every Saturday on the golf course?
rick coleman,I hate to break it to you but your old man's the one who's been taking all the money--he's a thief. Maggie's Father LAUGHS.
maggie,"Oh, thanks, but we've gotta get the kids home."
maggie's father,"Your mom and I will take 'em home. You two go out and have a good time- -cripes, you haven't been out all week. Grace perks up at this."
maggie,"Oh, I don't know, Dad, we really"
grace,"Excuse me, can I have a word with you? Grace pulls Maggie aside."
maggie,"Oh, come on, Grace, these guys are barely out of college, and, in case you've forgotten, we're married."
grace,"To who? Last I heard, Rick and Fred had the week off from marriage. So remind me again--who are we married to? Maggie thinks about this."
maggie,Well...I guess one beer won't kill us.
gary,"Oh boy, that's a toughie."
fred,How long would you have to make-out with him?
rick,Tongue?
fred,And how long would he have to blow you?
gary,"Oof. I mean, getting blown by a dude is bad, but making out with a guy, it's so.. .intimate."
rick,You think it's more intimate than getting blown by a guy?
gary,Way more.
baker,"All right, the hell with this shit, I'm outta here. Baker gets up from his stool."
baker,"I wanted to watch you guys pick up chicks, not talk about dicks."
fred,"Hey, greased lightning, let off the gas--sometimes these things take time."
gary,Baker's right. This is day three and you haven't even talked to a girl.
gary,"Yeah, this is boring. You guys are pussies."
fred,"Hey, I haven't seen you guys talk to any girls."
baker,We don't have hall passes!
rick,"No, you do not. And I love those guys but, let's be honest, they're not exactly chick-magnets."
fred,"You can say that again. Yep, the steak always looks better if you trim away some of the fat. And let's face it, we are the steak."
rick,"Dream team, baby. The guys CLINK BEERS. Then:"
fred,What?
rick,"Who are we kidding, man? Do you really think we're going to be picking up any girls this week?"
fred,Why wouldn't we?
rick,Because that's not us anymore.
fred,Wait a second. You want to quit?
rick,"Fred, we're not the same guys we were fifteen years ago, back when we were single. We've changed. Fred stares at him, incredulous."
fred,"No, man, you've changed. All you care about is yourself--what about all the guys out there who are counting on us to make this thing work?"
rick,What are you talking about?
fred,Don't you get it?
rick,"Come off it, Fred. Obviously hooking up isn't something we really want--if it was, we could've done it by now."
fred,Could we have? Rick is taken aback by this.
fred,Guess what? I did want to. And you know how close I got? We're three days in and the only woman I've spoken to was our waitress at Outback. And she never even made eye-contact.
rick,I don't really care if some waitress makes eye-contact. I want to go home--I miss my wife and kids.
fred,"Let me explain something to you: If Grace and Maggie find out we can't get laid on our own, they'll start thinking we need them to get laid. Do you know what that'll do to the balance of power in our homes? It'll destroy it! Rick thinks about this and grows alarmed."
rick,"Well, what if we just tell them that we did hook up?"
fred,We can't. Grace'll know. She always knows when I'm lying.
rick,"Hey, what about a massage parlor?"
fred,No! That's giving up. Fred glares at him.
rick,"All right, let's get out of here. I know exactly where we should be."
maggie,"So how about you, Rick, do you have any children?"
rick coleman,"Nah, but maybe some day. Your mom keeps talking about hooking me up with your cousin Kate. Maggie LAUGHS."
maggie,"No, I hardly know her. She moved to Miami when I was eight."
rick coleman,That's what your mom said. I coach at the University of Miami.
maggie,Then you should go out with her.
rick coleman,Nice try.
maggie,Uh...fourteen years. We were college sweethearts.
rick coleman,Nice. And where is he this week?
maggie,He's up in Boston.
rick coleman,"Poor guy. All work and no play, huh? Maggie forces a smile."
maggie,Something like that. Suddenly Grace is PROPELLED OUT OF THE WATER and UP ONTO
grace,Stop it! What are you doing?!
fred,"Jackpot, baby. Rick NOTICES SOMETHING O.S.."
rick,How about those two? ANGLE ON two pretty LATINO WOMEN sitting alone at a table.
fred,"Ooh, yeah. Daddy likes. Fred pulls a piece of paper out of his back pocket and hands it to Rick."
rick,What's this?
fred,I went on-line this afternoon and wrote down some good pick-up lines to break the ice.
fred,"That's a good one--except for one thing: We don't have a puppy, so when she gets there she'll realize we're full of shit. Rick shoots him a look."
rick,I don't think it's supposed to be for real. It's just to make her laugh so she'll talk to you. Fred considers this.
fred,"Oh God no, it doesn't work on that level. Here, this is my favorite. He takes the paper from Rick."
rick,It's a charmer but you know what? We don't need phony pick-up lines. Why don't we just be ourselves?
fred,Great. If you know how to. Rick takes a DEEP BREATH and braces himself.
rick,"Give me the helmet. Fred hands him the helmet, then Rick marches up to the two Latino Women with the helmet under his arm and Fred close on his heels."
fred,Hola. LONG BEAT as Rick tries to figure what to say next. Then:
rick,Well.. .this is awkward. I feel like I'm back at my first junior high school mixer.
fred,"No, he means his dick is Dublin. Like the city. In Ireland. As the girls turn away from them, we begin a... MUSIC MONTAGE - Hall & Oates' I Can't Go For That plays as our GUYS GET SHOT DOWN by a DOZEN DIFFERENT BEAUTIFUL WOMEN."
rick,I have this overwhelming urge to donkey-kick everyone in this bar.
fred,"Okay, tiger, keep your chin up--no one said this was going to be easy. Even in college you had to take fifty rejections for every score, remember?"
rick,"Yeah, but it didn't sting so much when I was drunk. Fred perks up."
fred,That's it! We should be drinking!
rick,You're right. We're too stiff.
fred,"Way too stiff. We gotta start pounding 'em, get those creative juices flowing, bring the soul to the surface. Rick smiles."
rick,That's when we're at our most charming!
fred,You say no to me? You say no to me?! I SAY NO TO YOU! He's being restrained by an unusually patient BOUNCER. In the b.g. we see Rick PASSED OUT ON A STOOL in a VERY AWKWARD
bouncer,"Come on, buddy, let's go... The women glare at Fred with disgust, maybe even a little amusement."
fred,"No, screw them!  You think your shit don't stink?! Well I got news for ya: I wouldn't titty-bang you in a snow storm!"
fred,"Nope, you blew it, not gonna happen."
bouncer," There you go, mister, you got 'em good. Now let's go. As the Bouncer drags him toward the exit, a STUNNING GIRL passes them WEARING TIGHT LEATHER PANTS with an AMERICAN FLAG PRINT ON THE BUTT. Fred turns to her."
fred,I know what we've been doing wrong. Rick lifts his chin.
rick,You mean like our wives?
fred,"Yeah, like that, but not them. Fred sits in the chair across from Rick."
rick,You've won over Coffee Girl?
fred,"Well, I'm sure she'd recognize me. Rick thinks about this."
rick,"Look, if you really want to go after someone you already know, have you considered Missy Frankenfield?"
fred,Which according to Hog-head means she's horny.
rick,"Bingo. As Fred smiles, we"
gerry,"What's up, beach bunnies? Grace and Maggie sit up and smile."
grace,"What are you doing here? He KICKS OFF THE SKI, then runs over and SHAKES HIS WET BODY"
gerry,"Hey, where are the kiddies? We thought we'd take you all for a boat ride."
maggie,"My parents took them to Martha's Vineyard for the weekend. Just then, we hear a LOUD HORN. They look up to see the boat pulling close to shore. Rick Coleman is behind the wheel and a couple PLAYERS are in the back. Maggie waves."
wannabe,Can I take your order? Rick sees that there's no one behind him. He turns to the Wannabe.
rick,"Uh...I don't know what I want. Wannabe stares at him, waiting. Rick hesitates a few moments, then levels with the guy."
wannabe,Why?
rick,"Uh, she knows how I like it."
leigh,Hi. What would you like? Rick was hoping to have a conversation but Wannabe is crowding them.
rick,Iced coffee. With two Splendas. Leigh rings him up.
leigh,That'll be two dollars. Rick hands her a fiver and nods toward the speakers.
rick,"By the way, nice tunes. Do you choose 'em or do they come down from corporate?"
leigh,Me. It's Snow Patrol.
rick,"Nice soundtrack. Pretty solid movie, too. Wannabe BARKS out a LAUGH."
wannabe,"Dude, you're thinking of Snow Do s-- the Cuba Gooding kiddie flick. This is Snow Patrol, the band. Rick shrugs, a little embarrassed."
leigh,"Thanks for the tip. As Leigh grabs a cup and goes to make the coffee, Wannabe SAYS SOMETHING to her that WE CAN'T HEAR and they both LAUGH. A PHONE RINGS in the employee room. Leigh hands Wannabe the coffee, then runs back to answer it. Wannabe hands Rick the iced coffee and winks at him."
wannabe,"Enjoy your two-Splenda'd iced coffee, mister. Rick starts to go, then turns around and stares at Wannabe. Wannabe, comforted by the counter between them, smiles back."
rick,Why are you smiling? You think this counter is some alligator-infested moat? Rick's stare becomes a glare and Wannabe loses his smile.
rick,You do? Leigh nods and starts to straighten up the tables.
leigh,"I don't really squat, just run on the hamster-wheel everyday after work. She starts wiping down a table."
coffee girl,So did you go to Harvard? She nods at Rick's t-shirt.
rick,Yeah.
leigh,"Great place. Real chill. And they have a bar, so I always grab a beer after my workout."
rick,"Bitchin'. Sounds like a nice routine. Maybe I'll routine it, too."
leigh,"If you join, tell 'em Leigh sent you--they'll give me two free months."
rick,"I'll do that, Leigh."
leigh,Rockin'. Leigh gives him the peace sign.
rick,"R-O-C-K in the U-S-A. Leigh smiles and as she heads back inside, we"
fred,"Hey, Missy, this is Fred Searing. I . uh, I dust wanted to give you a ring and, um...well, give me a call when you get back. It's kind of an emergency. Well, not life- threatening, but-- The machine CUTS HIM OFF. Fred HANGS UP, dejected. He sits there for a BEAT, then grabs his keys and GOES OUT THE DOOR."
fred,"Oh, hi. Kimmy nods blankly. The Daughter glares at him. Fred nervously steps up next to them in line, passing time as he waits for the sidewalk to clear."
fred,"That's right...  Well, gotta get going--I have a meeting across town in ten minutes. See ya. Fred EXITS."
fred,I'd prefer no paper trail.
fred,I don't think my insurance company's gonna cover this one.
fred,"Uh, no."
fred,"Look, I don't really want this in print. The Young Korean Woman hands him back the form."
fred,"Um, couldn't I just tell you? She stares at him for a LONG BEAT."
fred,"How about a C-note so I don't have to fill out any forms or show any I.D.'s? The Young Korean Woman thinks about this for a moment, then SLIDES OPEN THE ACCORDION WALL behind her, REVEALING... THE DRY CLEANERS NEXT DOOR - the Dry Cleaning Korean Lady looks back at him, along with Kimmy Long, her daughter, and"
song,".Night fever, night fever.. .we know how to do it...' As the song heats up, the crowd parts, REVEALING... Rick Coleman and Gerry decked-out in WHITE, TONY-MANARO-SUITS. They're DANCING UP A STORM with Maggie and Grace who are thrilled to be in such capable hands. Grace is getting tossed around a bit, but it's clear that Maggie can hold her own on a dance floor."
rick coleman,Wow. You can really move out there. Maggie shrugs modestly.
maggie,Thanks. I was a dance major in college.
rick coleman,Really? I always wondered--what do you do with a degree in dance?
maggie,"Well, as it turned out, nothing."
rick coleman,Why not?
maggie,"I don't know, you get busy, kids, school, there's so much going on."
rick coleman,"Well you gotta make time for the stuff you love or you'll forget who you are. Maggie appreciates the sentiment. She makes strong eye- contact with Rick for a moment, but catches herself and looks away."
maggie,"You know, my husband's name is Rick. Rick smiles at this."
rick coleman,"Well that makes me the perfect guy to have an affair with--you'd never have to worry about screaming out the wrong name during sex. Maggie smiles at this, but she seems a nick uncomfortable."
maggie,I know.
rick coleman,"Now come on, let's go find Grace and get something to eat. I'm starving. As they head back to the party, we"
flats,"Hey, Rick."
flats,"Great. What's up with you? How's that hall pass thing going? Rick makes a Scooby Doo sound, alarmed."
rick,Who told you about that--was it Hog- head?
flats,No. Some old lady was yakking about it down at the post office. Rick REACTS to this.
rick,"Uh, Flatsy, I gotta run. I'm late for my work-out appointment. When Rick hops out of his car, we see that he's wearing gym shorts and an old Springsteen t-shirt. He hesitates, then grabs a SWEATSHIRT out of the car and TIES IT AROUND HIS WAIST. Rick hurries down the sidewalk toward Leigh."
flats,"Hey, Rick! Good luck with the fishing! As Flats begins to LAUGH, a sheepish Rick scurries into the building."
leigh,"Clyde, this is my friend, uh..."
rick,Rick.
leigh,He's looking to join.
clyde,Great. I'll get you signed up. Leigh pats Rick's hand.
leigh,See ya.
rick,"So, uh, are you gonna grab a brewski after your work-out?"
leigh,Nah. Rick looks disappointed.
rick,"Peace it! As soon as he hears himself, Rick cringes."
rick,What's that about--you swimming the English Channel? The Metrosexual shoots Rick an annoyed look.
metrosexual,"Nah, Just not into looking like the knuckle-dragging guy on the evolution-of-man chart. Off Rick looking self-consciously down at his fur-covered body, we go..."
rick,"Oh...yes. He bunches up his towel and puts it behind his head, then settles in and CLOSES HIS EYES."
rick,What time is it?
rick,"About three hours. That's when Rick realizes that his head is RESTING ON THE GUY'S COCK. He tries to roll off him, but Metrosexual #1"
rick,"I'm okay, just help me up."
rick,"Okay, thanks, guys. I can take it from here. The metrosexuals release Rick and he gets about two steps before his LEGS GIVE OUT and he TUMBLES DOWN A SMALL FLIGHT"
fred,We let down the male species.
rick,"All right, don't give up."
fred,"I'm not giving up, I'm facing facts- -this is our last day and we got nothing cooking. Maybe you were right. Maybe we should just tell the girls to come home."
rick,"No. I want the hall pass. Fred looks at Rick, surprised."
fred,I'm not even sure I know what the dream is anymore.
rick,I just...I just want to know what it's like to be with another woman.
fred,"Well, just pull up one of the golden oldies in your spank bank-- it's almost like being there."
rick,I don't have anything in that spank bank.
fred,I'm talking about all the girls before you met Maggie. Rick doesn't say anything.
fred,Wow. That's a really creepy story. Just then Fred's cell phone RINGS and he ANSWERS it.
rick,Who was that?
fred,Just an angel from heaven. Suddenly Fred jumps to his feet.
maggie,Does this mean you're going steady?
maggie,"Grace, you should be flattered. You're thirty-eight-years-old and college kids are still swooning over you."
grace,Well I just feel bad if I gave him the wrong impression.
maggie,"The wrong impression? What makes you think that--I mean, besides the flowers, I.D. bracelet, and love letter? Maggie picks up a card."
grace,Thanks for piling on. Grace stands up and SIGHS.
rick,What are you doing?
fred,Just texting Missy Frankenfield that we're going to be at Enter the Dragon--I'm covering all my bases.
rick,"You don't need Missy Frankenfield tonight. If we can't get the job done with Coakley as our wingman, then we're pathetic. Just then, Fred NOTICES something O.S."
fred,"All right, here come da man! CLOSE ON RESTAURANT ENTRANCE - a suave, DEBONAIR MAN "
coakley,"My two favorite nutsuckers--how the hell are ya?! The three men hug, then Coakley nods toward Clooney."
rick,"No, who?"
coakley,George Clooney.
fred,What's he doing here?
coakley,I don't know--must be shooting a movie or something.
fred,"Huh. Look, man, we've got a situation on our hands."
coakley,"Yeah, yeah, Baker filled me in. S'been rough sledding, huh? Coakley puts his arms around the two guys."
coakley,I'm gonna need three-hundred bucks.
fred,For what? Coakley shoots him a look.
coakley,"If you're really serious about this, stop questioning me. The guys look at each other, then reluctantly COUGH UP THE DOUGH. With money in hand, Coakley marches confidently across the street followed by Fred and Rick. When the SLICK BOUNCER sees them approaching, he PARTS THE CROWD."
slick bouncer,"Good evening, Mr. Coakley."
coakley,"What up, my guy? Coakley PASSES ON THE MONEY with a handshake and the Bouncer UNHOOKS THE VELVET ROPE. Then Coakley smiles back at Fred and Rick."
coakley,"Okay, guys, you tried it your way and you railed miserably. You struck out, you were oh-for- everything. So now we do it my way, which is... The guys look at Coakley like Richard Gere looks at the Dalai Lama."
rick,Aren't you the guy who goes to the Hawaiian Tropic finals every year? Is that for the ugly girls?
coakley,"I go to the Tropic finals because Miss North Dakota's gonna lose and she's gonna need a hug. And quite often you can parlay a hug into a hand-job. Rick, you're up--get us two bottles of Moet and six glasses. Rick shoots Fred a look, then weaves his way through a scrum of PEOPLE up to the bar. He tries to flag down a bartender but can't get anyone's attention."
rick,"Oh, hey, Paige. What are you doing here? She pulls out her license and holds it up."
paige,I turned twenty-one yesterday.
rick,"Oh. Well, happy birthday. You out celebrating?"
paige,"Yeah, I'm here with my Aunt Meg. Paige points across the club to AUNT MEG, a striking redhead, early 40's, who's talking to a couple of YOUNG MEN."
rick,Nice. Rick continues to try to get the bartender's attention.
paige,"So, Rick, how's the hall pass going? Paige smirks at Rick who shrinks a little."
rick,"No, of course not--what did you just say?"
paige,I was asking about your hall pass.  I baby-sit for the Putneys and I heard Gary talking about it the other night at their barbecue. Rick REACTS to this.
rick,He was talking about it at a barbecue?!
paige,"Oh, he wasn't saying it in a bad way."
rick,"Thank you. A male BARTENDER, 25, finally appears in front of Rick."
paige,So does it work both ways?
rick,What?
paige,"The hall pass. Does your wife get one, too."
paige,Oh. Who made that rule?
rick,"Well ...um... As Rick thinks about this, Paige moves in tighter."
paige,"By the way, I kind of owe you an apology. (lowers her voice,"
bash,"Last week ful) when you drove me home, I shouldn't have snapped at you like that."
rick,"Oh, don't worry about it. It was a big misunderstanding."
paige,"No, it wasn't. She takes a moment, looks around."
rick,"Yeah. Um...I have to go, Paige, but it was great seeing you. Paige grabs Rick's arm as he tries to go. She looks suddenly annoyed."
paige,Are you serious? You're doing this again... even with a hall pass?
rick,"Paige, you're my kids' babysitter. Have a happy birthday. As Rick walks away, we go BACK ON COAKLEY AND FRED as Rick arrives with the champagne."
coakley,"Here we go, bubbles doth floweth."
fred,"Holy crap... look who's here. The guys turn to see the coffee girl, Leigh, walking past with two of her GIRLFRIENDS. She sees them and LIGHTS UP."
leigh,"Hey, Rick! What happened yesterday-- I thought we were gonna grab a beer? Fred looks at Rick, confused."
leigh,"Nah, I've never been here, but a friend of mine's DJ-ing tonight so I promised him I'd come. Just then Wannabe from the coffee shop swoo s in and gives Leigh a kiss on the cheek. He has a pair of headphones hanging around his neck."
wannabe,"Wassup, girl?"
rick,"Actually, I work for Sirius XM Radio--we're looking to hire some new deejays so I'm checking out all the clubs. Wannabe stiffens, suddenly respectful."
wannabe,Oh. Cool. Are you serious?
rick,"Not! Leigh is amused by this, but she tries to hide it from the deflated Wannabe."
fred,What gym do you belong to and where the hell was I?
coakley,"Well, according to Kimmy Long, you were at the massage parlor trying to get a rub-and-tug without filling out the paperwork. This takes the wind out of Fred's sails."
rick,What? Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick glares at Fred.
fred,I had a knot in my neck--why the hell didn't you tell me you saw Coffee Girl?!
coakley,"Okay, guys, cut the crap. We're all here for the same thing. And I'll give you a hint what that thing is: It begins with a 'P' and ends with an 'ussy.' Coakley puts his arm around Fred."
fred,Huh? Coakley spots something.
coakley,Ooh--there's a couple of trainwrecks. Let's go.
coakley,"Ladies, this is my friend Fred Pinkberry--his yogurt company just went public and he's out celebrating. He'd like to offer you a flute of champagne. The Chubby Blondes PERK UP."
rick,So.. .having a good time?
leigh,Chillin'.
rick,Me too. Just chillin' and wigglin'. LONG BEAT as they dance. Then:
rick,"Oh yeah? Just try to keep up. She smiles at this, then Coakley DANCES UP BESIDE RICK and"
coakley,Abort! Abort! You stand not a chance.
rick,"No, no, I think we're starting to gel. Coakley rolls his eyes."
coakley,"No, no, you're mistaken. Look, dude, this ain't Operation Cock- block here--now trust me, retreat. Rick glances back at Leigh, torn. She looks fantastic."
rick,"Coak, I'm never gonna have another hall pass, so this memory has to last a lifetime. . .you know what I mean? Coakley looks at Leigh and SIGHS."
coakley,"All right, I'll be at the bar when this thing blows up in your face. As Rick dances back over to Leigh, we... PAN ACROSS THE ROOM to the PISSED-OFF Wannabe watching them from the deejay booth."
rick,Is this guy your boyfriend or something?
leigh,"No, no, no. She waves it off, then shrugs guiltily."
rick,And what does 'messed around a little' mean these days?
leigh,Anal. Rick tries hard to act nonchalant.
maggie,Oh. Hey. She goes to the screen door.
rick coleman,Thought you might want to help me celebrate the end of the season. He holds up a grocery bag.
fred,Oh my god! You're here! Fred jumps off the bed and gives Missy a hug.
fred,Never felt better. Missy nods.
missy frankenfield,"I have to say, I can't believe I'm actually here--I was on my way home from dinner when I noticed your text. So what's this big emergency?"
fred,"Huh? Oh, uh, yeah. By 'emergency' I just meant that there's some important stuff I want to talk to you about. You know, one on one, me and you--without all the husbands and wives and hoopla. So how are you?"
missy frankenfield,I'm... good.
fred,"No, I mean how-are-you. Inside. What's happenin' in there? There must be all sorts of emotions churning up with the divorce and everything. She gives him a long look."
missy frankenfield,"Maybe we should go somewhere else-- this doesn't seem like the best place to spill one's guts. Just then, Coakley swoops in and pulls Fred aside."
fred,But...I know her. She said she wants to leave with me.
coakley,Then she's insane--run for the hills.
fred,"Coak, the woman's going through a divorce. She's not insane, she's just making really poor decisions right now.  Here, give Rick the keys to my mini- van. I'm gonna go back to the hotel with Missy. Coakley looks back at Missy and softens."
coakley,"It's your funeral, princess. BACK ON RICK AND LEIGH dancing up a storm. Rick is OUT OF BREATH and SWEATING LIKE A PIG. His shirt is soaked and his hair is dripping wet."
leigh,Are you okay--you keep checking your pulse?
rick,"Nah, I'm fine. I had a little chest cramp during the last song, but I worked through it. She smiles at this."
leigh,"Come on, let's sit this one out. I need a breather. They move to the bar and Rick starts DRYING HIMSELF with a stack of cocktail napkins."
rick,Um...have you ever heard of a hall pass?
gerry,"There she is! Come on in, I'm mixing up some margaronis. We lost our final game, but I got four hits!"
grace,"Oh. Great. Uh, where is everyone?"
gerry,They all went out to party--now get in here! But Grace stays on the porch.
grace,"Gerry, I'm sorry but I can't stay."
gerry,What? Grace hasn't been in this situation in a long time and it shows. Gerry steps out onto the porch looking concerned.
grace,"Yeah, yeah, everything's fine, but...  .I can't accept this."
gerry,Why not? Grace does a double-take.
grace,"Gerry, I'm a married woman. Gerry nods at this, maybe a little hurt. She hands him the box and he reluctantly accepts it."
gerry,"Um... I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable, Grace. It's just that...I really like you."
grace,"I like you, too, Gerry, and you didn't make me uncomfortable. She smiles at him and he forces a smile back, and there's some serious eye-contact, and then BAM! They DIVE AT EACH OTHER and start SUCKING FACE LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW. As they continue to MAUL EACH OTHER, they STUMBLE INTO THE HOUSE, and we"
leigh,So...you're married?
rick,I wasn't deliberately hiding it. He holds up his ring hand.
leigh,"Yeah, I just thought your wife had died or something and you were wearing it out of respect."
coakley,"Come on, you're not gonna close the sale here--let's move this clambake back to my place."
rick,"Okay, but what am I gonna do there?"
coakley,"What do you mean, what are you gonna do? I've got a house with bedrooms--do the math. When it doesn't work out with her--which it won't--there's going to be a bunch of other back-up chicks there. Rick nods then turns to Leigh."
rick,My buddy's inviting everybody back to his crib.
leigh,"Sounds cool. As they walk toward the exit, we"
missy frankenfield,"I've got to be honest, Fred... I'm not really sure what we're doing here."
fred,"What do you mean? We're hangin', we're connecting--that's what friends do. Especially if they want to take it to the next level where they can call each other 'good friends.'"
missy frankenfield,"You're married, Fred."
fred,"Ah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Fred opens the door but Missy stays in the hall."
missy frankenfield,"What does blah-blah mean? You are still married, right?"
fred,"Happily. Look, I don't want to get into all the details, but my wife gave me this one-time deal where I get to be with another woman. He opens the door wide. She looks at him for a BEAT."
missy frankenfield,I thought we were going to the hotel bar?
fred,"We are. There's a mini-bar in my room. You better hurry up, it's last call. Fred smiles."
missy frankenfield,Are you out of your flippin' mind? Fred loses the smile.
fred,Um...
missy frankenfield,Are you out of your mind?!
fred,I'm going to be honest with you-- your tone right now is scaring me.
missy frankenfield,"You call me up for the first time in your life, claim you have some kind of emergency, and it turns out that you just want to screw me?!"
fred,Or not.
missy frankenfield,"Well, screw you, Fred! She starts walking down the hallway. Fred nods, unfazed."
fred,Nail on the head! She turns and glares at him.
missy frankenfield,What?
fred,What you just said--I had that coming. Big time. Fred hangs his head.
missy frankenfield,Okay. Whatever.
fred,Thank you.
missy frankenfield,"Fuck you, Fred! Missy STORMS away."
fred,Hi. May I help you? REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS Paige's Aunt Meg. She's wearing a skirt and low-cut tank top and has cougar written all over her.
aunt meg,"Rick, my name's Meg. I'm your babysitter Paige's aunt, and I just wanted to come over here and tell you this: They don't make men like you anymore. She smiles."
fred,"Oh. Well, thank you."
gerry,Everything okay?
grace,"Yeah. Yeah. It's just ...no, everything's not okay."
gerry,What? He moves close to her and she grows uncomfortable.
grace,"Look, you're a great cguy, Gerry, and you're very charming and very sweet and the last thing I wanted to do was hurt your feelings, but...well, what,just happened can never happen again. Gerry looks confused."
gerry,Oh.
grace,I know it's probably hard for you to understand but...I love my husband.
gerry,So? What does that have to do with anything? Fate threw us together and we went with it--isn't that what life's all about?
grace,Not always.
gerry,I know that.
grace,You do?
grace,Right.
gerry,"I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm just saying, I didn't think we were going to start dating, you know? Could you imagine the looks we'd get? It'd be like Hugh Hefner and his girlfriends--except in reverse. Gerry CHUCKLES."
grace,"Yeah, I got that part. Gerry looks at his watch."
gerry,"Ooh, I gotta get going. We have kind of a team meeting in like twenty minutes. Gerry sees Grace glance at the clock: 12:15 A.M."
grace,You don't have to explain.
gerry,"Seriously, though, thanks for everything--that was awesome. He holds up his hand and she diligently HIGH-FIVES HIM. Then Gerry WALKS OUT THE DOOR. Grace sits there alone for a moment. We PUSH IN ON HER and we hear Gerry's CAR START OUTSIDE, and when Grace STARTS TO CRY, we"
leigh,I guess I still have a lot to get out of my system before I do the marriage trip. I'm one of those people who wants to try everything once before I die.
leigh,No.
rick,"Neither have I. Rick winces, but Leigh smiles at him. It's the moment of truth."
leigh,You would?
rick,Yes. Leigh gets close.
leigh,I don't want to be a home-wrecker.
rick,"I've got a one-time pass, remember?"
leigh,That wasn't just a line?
rick,"No. It's for real. Leigh seems intrigued. She moves closer still, takes his hand."
leigh,So where can we go to talk some more about this?
leigh,Can you give me a second?
rick,"Sure. Wannabe and Leigh walk a few feet away and Rick watches them have an ANIMATED CONVERSATION. It appears Wannabe may even be crying. Finally, Wannabe storms across the room but when he gets to the door, he looks back at Leigh."
wannabe,"Well? Are you coming? Leigh SIGHS, then approaches Rick."
leigh,"I'm sorry, Rick. I have to go deal with this. Rick can't believe what's happening."
rick,Really? Now? I thought you said he wasn't your boyfriend.
leigh,"He's not...but he is a friend. Leigh glances at the broken-down Wannabe standing there at the door, then turns back to Rick."
maggie,.And he hasn't even spent one night in his own bed this week.
rick coleman,Let me get this straight--you gave him his freedom and now you're mad that he's acting free? This logic clearly stings Maggie.
maggie,I called his assistant--he's been in the office almost everyday.
rick coleman,"Look, Maggie, for all you know your husband's been working at a sou kitchen, sleeping in his car al week, and he's only gotten laid two or three times at most. She looks up and forces a smile."
maggie,Ha-ha. Maggie checks her watch.
rick coleman,"Well, if she went over to break the kid's heart, the least she could do is lend a sympathetic ear. He flips a pancake onto a plate."
maggie,Oh My-lanta.
rick coleman,"And to wash it all down... Rick reaches into the bag and pulls out a DESSERT WINE. Off Maggie's smile, we"
rick,Hey. . .what are you guys doing here?
rick,Really? I thought you guys had given up on us?
baker,"We did. We're here with them. He nods toward RICK LEARY and WILLY BOSHANE, both early 40's and paunchy."
rick,What are you talking about?
baker,"When Leary and Boshane heard about your guy's hall pass, they convinced their wives to give them one, too. A smiling Leary tries to HIGH-FIVE Rick, but he's having none of it. He turns to Baker, livid."
rick,You weren't supposed to tell anyone about the hall pass!
leary,They didn't say anything. Our wives heard about it at the pool.
rick,"No! At the pool?! Rick rubs his face, distressed."
boshane,Yep. And then about three days ago-- after some hard-core negotiating-- we managed to push the bill through. The guys LAUGH. Rick can hardly believe what he's spawned.
rick,Really? So...how's it going?
boshane,Solid. Very solid.
leary,We're building mucho momentumo. Baker makes a JERK-OFF MOTION.
boshane,"That's right. It's about going bowling and, uh, staying up late, and being able to do what you want to do when you want to do it."
rick,"Haven't gotten laid yet, huh?"
gary,"Hey, dudes, there's like ten very bangable chicks out on the back deck--let's go! Leary HOLDS UP HIS BEER."
leary,"To freedom! The guys TAP their beer cups, then EXIT toward the back deck. A dejected and defeated Rick watches them go, then turns and pushes his way through the crowd to the front door. As he OPENS THE DOOR to leave, he finds himself FACE-TO-FACE WITH"
leigh,"Hey, where are you going?"
rick,What are you doing...? I thought you'd left.
leigh,"No. I told you, I just had to talk him off the ledge. I calmed him down and sent him on his way."
rick,"Oh. Uh, great."
leigh,"So where's that game room? I thought we were gonna play some games. She smiles and takes his hand and as they walk away, we go..."
leigh,"I'll be right back--I just have to use the bathroom. Rick nods, then watches as Leigh walks off and disappears into the bathroom. He takes a DEEP BREATH. This is it. Just then he hears O.S. LAUGHTER. Rick heads down the hallway and pushes open a door."
rick,"Hey. How come you're not downstairs partying? Coakley gives him a sad, worn-out smile."
coakley,"All partied out, pal. Rick nods, understanding. Coakley LAUGHS once again at the"
rick,How's that?
coakley,"Well think about it. There's two kinds of guys who cheat on their wives: The guy who does it behind her back, and a guy like you who has his wife's permission."
rick,Well it's not really cheating if I have permission.
coakley,"Yeah, whatever. The point is, if you asked a hundred people who the better CJuy is, ninety-nine of 'em would pick you, because you're being honest--there's no deceit involved. Rick is growing uncomfortable."
rick,Well I didn't really think of it
coakley,It's like she's your guilt Sherpa! Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick deflates.
coakley,"And that, my friend, is why you are a genius. As Rick lets this all sink in, we"
fred,Cheers. They CLINK glasses.
aunt meg,"Rick, I hope you don't mind me tracking you down--Paige told me where you were staying."
fred,Please. Not at all.
aunt meg,You've been very sweet to her. Fred waves her off.
fred,"Hey, she's a good kid. I do what I can for the kids. Aunt Meg moves in a little closer, squints at him sweetly."
aunt meg,"She told me everything. And I have to say, I was very impressed."
fred,Hm?
aunt meg,I know she tried to hook-up with you--twice in fact--and that you set her straight both times. Fred hadn't heard this from Rick and is a little confused.
fred,Uh...hook-up?
fred,Well... she's a kid and kids get crushes. I remember in tenth grade I had the biggest crush on my French teacher--thank God Mr. LeClaire was professional enough to only date seniors. Meg GIGGLES.
aunt meg,"I'm serious, it takes a certain kind of guy to say no to a beautiful young girl like that-- especially since you have your wi e's permission now. Meg shoots him a knowing smile and puts her glass down."
fred,"Hey, all you have in this world is your word. As Aunt Meg CLIMBS ON TOP OF FRED, we"
rick,"Leigh, I gotta split."
leigh,What?
leigh,"Really? Are you feeling okay? You're not mad because I went outside with my friend, are you?"
rick,"No, no, no. Look, I shouldn't be doing this. I have.. .you know, commitments. Leigh nods at this, then unties a shoulder strap and her DRESS FALLS TO THE FLOOR. Suddenly she's NAKED before him and she's PERFECT."
leigh,"Relax. Don't think so much. You're gonna have your wife for the rest of your life, but tonight. . .you have me. Leigh smiles. And it's the kind of smile you only get two or three times in your life, if you're lucky, and probably never from a woman this beautiful. She reaches down and UNBUCKLES HIS PANTS, then she PULLS OFF HIS SHIRT. They stand face-to-face now, the middle-aged guy and the young beauty, and it's happening exactly the way Rick had hoped it would, the dream. She presses her body against his and STARTS TO KISS HIS NECK, her hand DISAPPEARING SOMEWHERE BELOW HIS WAIST. Then she leans her head AGAINST HIS CHEST. As he looks down at her, we PUSH IN on a suddenly conflicted Rick."
rick,Nope. I can't do this. He reaches for his shirt.
leigh,What are you doing?
rick,"I'm sorry. She stares at him, confused, as he buckles his pants."
leigh,"Your wife didn't give you a hallway permission slip, did she?"
rick,"Yes, she did, but... look, you're insanely beautiful and pathologically sexy and every cell in my body is telling me to dust do this, but-- Rick points to his chest."
leigh,"Well, I think you have a screw loose and you're probably going to regret this for the rest of your life, but. . .right on, man."
rick,Um...do you want me to give you a ride home?
leigh,No. It's only one-thirty--I'm going back down to the party. Rick raises two fingers.
rick,Peace it.
leigh,"R-O-C-K in the U-S-A. As they smile at each other one last time, we"
rick,Hello.
rick,"Oh, uh, no, I'm sorry, he's not here right now. I'm using his car."
aunt meg,I'm attracted to men with integrity.
fred,"Thanks--wow, you got great jugs. Meg takes Fred's hand and leads him toward the bed , Fred WADDLING LIKE A PENGUIN."
aunt meg,"Moral-guy's a tit-man, huh?"
aunt meg,"Oh yes! Rick... please...I want you to make love to me. Just then Rick BURSTS INTO THE ROOM, out of breath. Fred and Meg come up from under the covers. "
rick,"Fred, I need to talk to you! Meg GLARES down at Fred, confused."
aunt meg,Fred? I thought you were Rick?!
rick,I'm Rick. Fred cowers guiltily.
fred,"Please don't judge me. As Aunt Meg KARATE KICKS Fred in the face, we"
fred,What did they tell you? Is Grace gonna be okay?
rick,All I know is she was in a car accident and they rushed her to the hospital.
fred,Oh my God... Suddenly they hear O.S. GLASS SHATTERING. They look up and
wannabe,"How do you like me now, Splenda- boy?"
fred,"You moron, that's Lny car! His is the one next to it! Wannabe looks over at Rick's Avalon, PULLS OUT A KNIFE, and quickly SLASHES TWO OF RICK'S TIRES. As Rick and Fred RUN TOWARD HIM, Wannabe JUMPS INTO AN OLD BRONCO and PEELS OUT OF"
rick,"Nice job, Fred."
fred,Oh come on! How can a hospital not have a live operator?!
rick,"It's four in the morning, Fred. Fred hangs up and pounds his steering wheel."
fred,What was I thinking?! I had a great wife--a beautiful wife--and now I may lose her.. .because of you.
rick,"What are you talking about?! You said our wives were living their dreams, with their fancy gas ovens, and that our dream was the hall pass! How can you blame this on me?!"
fred,"I'd never even heard of a hall pass until you flaunted yours in my face! 'Hey, look at me, I've got a hall pass--everyone should have a hall pass!' You ruined my life, Mills!"
rick coleman,This is a great place.
maggie,"Yeah, my family's had it since I was a kid. We used to come for a week a summer, then two weeks, then a month, then by the time I got to high school we were living here all summer long."
rick coleman,"Something's wrong here, Maggie."
maggie,Hm?
rick coleman,Something's wrong with a guy who would leave a woman like you alone for this long.
rick coleman,"So what? If you were my girl, I wouldn't have taken it. An awkward moment. Rick touches her hand and Maggie looks away."
maggie,"Uh, in Rick's defense, he didn't really even want the hall pass. I kind of forced it on him."
rick coleman,Why would you do that? Maggie thinks about this.
maggie,I don't know.
rick coleman,What?
maggie,This hall pass ...it wasn't for him.
fred,"I'm sorry, man, I shouldn't have blamed you for this. I'm the one who dragged you into this thing."
rick,"No, you didn't. I went willingly."
fred,"I've been bad, Rick. I've been real bad."
rick,We've both been bad.
fred,I've been worse. I kissed your babysitter's aunt.
rick,That's not so bad.
fred,On the vagina.
rick,Ooh. They hear a SIREN and Rick looks back to see the cops on their tail.
rick,"Pull over, man!"
fred,"No way, I can out-run 'em!"
rick,No you can't--not in this thing!
rick,"Oh God, now there's two of 'em!"
fred,I don't care--I'm not stopping 'til we get there!
rick,Are you crazy?!
fred,"Yeah, I'm crazy! I'm crazy about my wife!"
rick,"Hear me out, gentlemen, I can explain everything! A BURLY OFFICER from the back-up car form-tackles Rick, BLASTING him backwards onto the sidewalk. Fred and Rick manage to roll away and then CRAWL THROUGH THE"
fred,Grace needs me! Cop #1 PINS FRED'S HEAD TO THE FLOOR as Cop #2 lays across his legs.
fred,"No, I won't take it easy! Look, I'm sorry I was speeding and I shouldn't have run from you guys, but my wife's been in an accident and she's in this emergency room and I gotta see how she is because..."
doctor,Are you the husband of...  .Grace Searing? Fred strains to look up.
fred,Yes! Is she okay?! The Doctor hesitates and the cops look at each other and then the Burly Officer releases Rick from his head-lock.
burly officer,"All right, let him up. The young officers get off Fred and help him up. Fred rushes to the Doctor, who seems very serious."
fred,Please tell me she's gonna be okay.
doctor,"She is. Your wife broke her nose and she got shaken up a bit, but all in all she's a very lucky woman."
fred,"You got that wrong, doc. I'm the lucky one. Fred is visibly relieved as the doctor smiles and walks off."
rick,"You take care of that woman, buddy, and I'm gonna go home and take care of mine. Fred nods, emotional, as the cops look at each other, unmoved. Rick starts to walk away."
fred,Rick... Rick stops and turns at the door.
burly officer,"Uh, before you 'go love that lady', we're going to have to write you guys up. As the officer pulls out his CITATION PAD, we"
rick,I know. She's okay. Maggie goes back to the phone.
maggie,What?
rick,"The day I lost my virginity. March 25th, 1988 at approximately ten- thirty in the evening. Maggie thinks about this."
maggie,"What are you talking about? We were dating then. Rick nods. She looks at him, not sure if she understands."
rick,"You were my first. And you were my last. And you were everything in between. As it all sinks in, Maggie STARTS TO WELL UP."
maggie,Really?
rick,Really.
maggie,"So...is that why you were crying that first night? Rick shrugs, embarrassed."
rick,You are my only. Forever.
fred,.And what were you doing driving around at one o'clock in the morning?
fred,"I'm sorry, Grace."
grace,For what?
fred,For putting you through all this. Grace looks awash in guilt.
grace,"It's not your fault, Fred."
fred,"Yes, it is--of course it's my fault. This isn't you--driving around all night, thinking--you're not a thinker. When she looks up at him, he forces a smile. But she doesn't smile back."
grace,"Look, Fred, we have to talk about... about what happened this week. Fred takes a DEEP BREATH and looks around, trying to avoid the moment."
fred,Grace. . .do we really have to do this? Grace lowers her head guiltily.
grace,"Yeah. Yeah, we do. When she looks back up, she NOTICES the SPRAY-PAINTED and"
grace,Um...deal. Fred gets up and THROWS HIS ARMS AROUND HIS WIFE.
rick,"Come on, you two! We're gonna go watch the sun come up!"
