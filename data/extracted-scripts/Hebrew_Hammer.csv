Speaker,Dialogue
mordechai,Yes Mrs. Highsmith.
hammer,Happy Hanukkah Maccabee.
old woman,"Hammer, why don't you come eat by us for Shabat. My Miriam is all grown up now. God willing, you should settle down and marry."
hammer,"Thanks for the invite Mrs. Kleinman, but right now G dash d's the only one for me."
old woman,I can dig it.
hammer, Shabat Shalom!
shlomo,Give it back! Give me back my yarmulke!
hammer,Did you just take god's name in vain?
hammer,"Just about to leave, right?"
hammer,You alright?
shlomo,I guess. Sometimes I wonder why I even bother praying to one god.
hammer,"Hey, hey! Be proud of who you are. You're a bad, bold, big-nosed, biblical brother. You feelin' me?"
shlomo,Yeah. You're right.
hammer,Aveenooh Shalom Alechem little brother.
shlomo,Thanks Hammer.
hammer,Stay Jewish.
hammer,Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
tikva,Happy Hanukkah Morty.
hammer,"So, what's shakin' Yenta."
tikva,"Well, for stahters, your mother called. She said to remind you that you're having Shabat Dinner by her tomorrow, and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz, and she wanted me to relate the following information to you."
hammer,"Okay, what's the information?"
tikva,She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
hammer,Anything else?
tikva,"Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist."
hammer,But we're not open on Sundays.
tikva,I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
hammer, I'll be in my office.
damian,Ho. Ho. Ho.
santa claus,"Et tu, Blitzen?"
chief,Gentleman!
hall,Hey!
chief,"The time for action is now. We predict that the St. Nick Day Massacre will put Hanukkah-Christmas relations back at least a hundred years. With this meshuggena new Santa Claus in power, Hanukkah is in jeopardy. Our first order of business is to put into motion a plan to create goodwill towards the Jewish Community. Mr. Chairman of the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy."
harvey weinstein,Yes Chief.
chief,"We need your people to crank out a couple more award winning documentaries on the Holocaust, possibly a new Adam Sandler movie."
adl chairman,Not another Adam Sandler movie!
harvey weinstein,What's wrong with Adam Sandler movies?
adl chairman,We're trying to create goodwill here. I just think...
harvey weinstein,"Frankly, I don't care what you think. I think you're a putz."
adl chairman, Don't defame me. I'm against that.
chief,"Focus people. Our next order of business is to assign an agent to track Santa's activities. Step in and use force if the situation calls for it. We need to put the toughest Jew we have on the case. Suggestions? Suggestions, anybody?"
chief,"C'mon, he made ET. We need someone tough people."
chief,He's in a wheelchair for crying out loud.
chief,Too old.
adl chairman,Joe Lieberman?
chief,Missing in action.
chief,He's a lawyer. We're looking for heros people.
harvey weinstein,David Copperfield?
chief,"What's he gonna do, make Santa disappear? Think people think. We need a hard hittin' Hebe on this one."
esther,What about Mordechai Jefferson Carver?
chief,"The Hebrew Hammer? No. No way. After the way he handled that situation in the West Bank? He's the only Jew in the world too extreme for the JDL. There's a reason why we kicked him out of our ranks, sweetheart. We need a man who can follow orders. A man with self-control. We need a man..."
council elder,...We need a man who can get the job done.
esther,"Daddy, he's our only hope. And you know it."
adl chairman,"Only problem is, ever since we kicked him out, he wants nothing to do with us. There's no way we can persuade him to come back."
esther,Perhaps I can persuade him.
esther,Mr. Jefferson Carver?
hammer,"Please, call me Mordechai."
esther,"Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?"
esther,My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
hammer,How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
esther," Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively."
hammer,Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
esther,"Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of."
hammer,"I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good friend, but my days..."
blonde bombshell,Mr. Hammer? I'd like to hire you to put a tail on my husband. I think my life might be in danger. I think he wants to kill me.
hammer,"Sorry Shiksa, I think you got the wrong office. I'm the Hebrew Hammer. Mike Hammer's down the hall."
blonde bombshell,Oh.
hammer,"Listen. Esther, you seem like a nice girl, so I'm only gonna say this once. I no longer affiliate myself with that organization. The politics there were brutal. Besides, I've already got a full case load."
esther,Why are you being so difficult? All my father wants is to just speak with...
hammer,"I hate to cut you short, but in an hour the sun goes down, and then it's officially the Sabbath. I can't work on the Sabbath. This is where we're going to have to part ways boobola."
esther,I'm not leaving your side until I get you to agree to come speak with my father.
hammer,"Be my guest. But I have to warn you, I'm going to my mother's for dinner tonight. And if you think I'm difficult, wait till you meet her."
esther," Before we leave, there's just one more thing. I noticed that the sign on your door says you're a certified circumcised dick. Would you mind if I asked to see your credentials?"
hammer,Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
esther,It's Esther.
hammer,"Oy vey, I'm stuffed."
esther,I don't think I could eat another latke if you paid me.
hammer,"Mom, I think we've had enough."
hammer,"Mom! Esther works for the JDL. They sent her to try and recruit me back to save Hanukkah for them. What she doesn't seem to understand is that nothing, not even god himself could convince me to ever work for them again."
esther,But Hanukkah's in dan...
hammer,"Not my problem. If you'll excuse me now, I need to use the bathroom."
esther,"He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me."
esther, What do you want me to do?
hammer,"Mom, where do you keep the plunger?"
esther,Deal.
hammer,"So, what did you two ladies discuss while I was gone."
esther,Thanks. That's...good to know.
hammer,"Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother."
hammer,"Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people."
hammer, So don't show a picture.
hammer,"Oh. Oh, What. So, all of a sudden my saving Hanukkah's not good enough for you? Is that what your saying?"
hammer,"No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture."
hammer,"Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?"
computerized voice,Jew Confirmation Test initiated.
hammer,You've gotta be kidding me. They're still doing this?
computerized voice,Please state your full Hebrew name.
hammer,Mordechai Baruch Netanyahoo.
computerized voice,Please state the six dishes found on the Passover Seder plate in alphabetical order?
hammer,"Beitzah, Charoset, Chazeret, Karpas, Maror, and Zeroa."
computerized voice,Please demonstrate musical aptitude.
hammer,Oooh. That's cold.
computerized voice,Circumcision confirmed.
hammer,"Hello? Can anybody hear me? I think this machine is broken or something. Hello?  This is ridiculous! I didn't even want to come here. I shlep all the way out to the middle of nowhere, for lord knows what purpose, and..."
chief,Come on. Come on.
chief,"Since you've been gone Hammer, some things have changed around here. Our agents are now subjected to a strict physical training regiment. Take a look."
hammer,"A minion practicing Jew-do, the deadly fighting art. Cool."
chief,There's more. Follow me.
hammer,"Alright. I'll, uh, keep doing that."
chief,"Sammy, if you'll excuse us, Mordechai and I have business to attend to."
chief,"Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank."
hammer,I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
chief,"A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?"
hammer," Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion."
chief,Well it's good to see that you can be so nonchalant about the whole thing.
hammer," I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack."
chief,What's your first move?
hammer,I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.
chief,You be careful Hammer.
hammer,"Okay. You guys have seriously got to stop with that stuff. That's a lot of pressure to put on one Jew. I'm only human you know. I'm already shvitzing about the whole thing. You know, believe it or not, I'm allowed to make mistakes, too. I can only do the best that I can do, and that's just gonna have to be good enough for all of you."
black teenager,"Hey, yo, we got ourselves a visitor."
black teenager,It's some pimped out Hebrew dude in a caddy.
mohammed,The Hebrew Hammer! My main Kike!
hammer,Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim. My main nigga!
white accountant,You...you just called him a Kike.
mohammed,Well it's okay when we call each other that.
white accountant,Oh.
mohammed,"So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?"
hammer,I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
mohammed,"Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode."
hammer,"True dat. True dat. So, what's the word on the street?"
mohammed,"Word is that papa's got a brand new bag, and it's velvety red, and it ain't gonna be overnight Fed-Exed to Jerusalem. If you know what I mean."
hammer,"Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?"
mohammed,Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
hammer,Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
mohammed,I don't. But I know somebody who does.
jamal,'Sup.
mohammed,I'd like for you to tell him what you told me.
jamal,"A'ight, a'ight, cool. Yo, it's like this. That nigga Santy Claus be trippin'. First that motherfucker kills his own pops, then he start talkin' 'bout bustin a cap in Hanukkah's ass. Next, the racist motherfucker kick my ass out the workshop, sayin' that there ain't no room for no little colored elves like me. Can you believe that shit? Yo, if it wasn't for the arthritis in my joints, you best believe that I'd be..."
hammer,"Is there anything else you can tell me? His hangouts, his next move, anything?"
jamal,"Well, come to think of it, there is one thing. Before I left, I was packin' up my shit and I overheard the nigga talkin' to some business pahtnah or something. Sayin that he'd meet him today at some joint called Duke's. Round five o'clock if my memory serves. When he got off the phone and jetted, I scoped the room for some jewelry, cash, whatevers. You know, a severance package. Didn't find any duckets, but I did snatch this."
hammer,"Thanks little brother, you've been a big help."
jamal,"Shit fool, ain't no thang. If it wasn't for my real brothers here at the K.L.F., I'd be shining shoes at the train station or getting my afro tossed up against a velcro wall in some redneck bar somewhere. I finally gots a place where I belong. Fuck Christmas. I'm all about smoking blunts and pimpin' bitches. I'm all about Kwanzaa nigga!"
mohammed,He's new. He's still got a long way to go before he understands the true meaning of Kwanzaa.
hammer,"Thanks again Mo, you always deliver the goods."
mohammed,You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
hammer,"Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is."
mohammed,"It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother."
hammer,Alekem Salam.
santa,Excellent. Everything is going as planned.
jamal,"Pfff. Shit nigga, ain't no thang. Hey, yo Santy Claus, so does this mean that you gonna make me an official elf now?"
santa,Can you believe this guy Tiny Tim?
jamal,That's some cold shit.
head elf,"Utopian model of efficiency my ass! Ever since you took charge, this place has been more like a sweatshop."
santa,"You know something, you're right."
head elf,Really?
santa,"Yeah. This is a sweatshop. And since you elves aren't willing to do the work, I made arrangements to have some Taiwanese children shipped over. And I might add, they're more than willing to work for peanuts."
tiny tim,"So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?"
santa,"While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant."
tiny tim,What should I charge?
santa,"Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples."
tiny tim,So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
santa,Worse.
tiny tim,That's some cold shit.
hammer,Manischewitz. Straight up.
skinhead bartender,"Usually we don't serve your kind. But since you had the balls to walk in here, Kike, I'll pour you one last drink before we lynch you."
hammer,"Actually, can I have the black label?"
skinhead bartender,Be my guest.
hammer,"Do you guys take Shekels? I just got back from a trip in Israel, and all I've got is a fistful of Shekels."
television set,"Papa, Papa! Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing an angel gets his wings!"
hammer,"Shlomo, you okay?"
shlomo," Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing, an angel gets his wings!"
hammer,Huh.
shlomo,"Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing, an angel gets his wings!"
hammer,Bootleg 'It's A Wonderful Life' from Taiwan.
shlomo,Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
hammer,Get yourself home and watch this as soon as possible.
shlomo,"Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing, an angel gets his wings!"
hammer,"Hey, hey, hey! You can beat this. Now get going."
hammer,"Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead."
chief,"You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?"
hammer,That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.
chief,We're on it Hammer. How'd you do with Santa?
hammer,It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
chief,"Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once."
hammer,"Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen."
chief,One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
hammer,"The fate of Hanukkah. Right. Right. Yeah, Got it. Will do. Okay, bye now."
tiny tim,One partridge in a pear tree to two turtle doves. What's your status?
tony,Nothing stirring here.
tony,"Let's get a look at you, shall we."
tony,"Oh really! Is that a fact? Well guess what buddy? You ain't gettin' in to see Santa today, so why don't you just turn around and high tail it home."
tony,But I've been waiting to see Santa all year.
esther,Any sign of Santa?
hammer,"He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would."
samples woman,Could I interest you in a free sample bacon cheeseburger?
hammer,"While I thank you, Gentile friend, for your generous offer of that deliciously unkosher snack, I sadly have to decline for I stuffed myself full of meat and milk product at a prior lunch engagement."
esther,You're good.
tony,"Can I have everyone's attention please. In fifteen minutes, Santa's gonna have to leave."
esther,What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
hammer,C'mon follow me.
esther," Is that...? No, couldn't be."
tony,"Hey, hey! Not so fast."
hammer,We have to get through. It's an emergency.
tony,"Sorry pal, you're gonna have to wait in line just like all the other parents."
esther,"We're so sorry to have to cut, but our beautiful Gentile boy ran on ahead of us in line."
tony,"Well...umm, when you put it that way. Sure go on through."
hammer,You're good!
santa,And what do the Jewish people do during Hanukkah?
jimmy,"They worship the devil and sacrifice small Gentile children like me in bizarre, sadistic rituals."
santa,That's right. Santa can tell that you've been a very good boy this year. Run along now Jimmy.
hammer,"If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt."
santa,"Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?"
hammer,"Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah."
santa,The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
hammer,"What's your shpiel, Santa?"
santa,"Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering?  Girls."
bambi,"Oh, I declare I just love Jewish men. They're so sensitive and well read."
hammer,Sorry Santa. I like my women like my matzah. Unleavened.
tony,"Hey, hurry it up in there. We gotta bunch of kids..."
esther,Back it up buddy!
mc hammer,"Please Hammer, don't hurt em'!"
hammer,Let's do this clean. I don't want to make a scene Santa.
santa,"Well, it's a bit too late for that now, isn't it? Excuse me children, if I could have your attention for a moment."
hammer,What are you doing?
santa,"I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer."
hammer,Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
santa,"In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year."
hammer,C'mon!
hammer,It's over. We're doomed.
esther,"Shh. Shh, listen. Do you hear that?"
hammer,What is that?
harriet tubbelman,"Psst. Hammer, Esther. This way. Hurry!"
hammer,You saved our lives. Thank you. How can I ever repay you...?
harriet tubbelman,"...My name is Harriet Tubbelman, but you can call me Moses. The only payment I ask Mordechai, is that you keep Hanukkah safe for us all."
hammer,Where are we? What is this place?
harriet tubbelman,"Welcome to the Underground Jewish Railroad. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride."
hammer,That got annoying fairly quickly.
esther,"Yeah, no kidding."
carnival worker,Tickets please.
hammer,"Nah, we're kosher. Thanks though."
esther,"So, now what?"
hammer,Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
esther,Sure. Why not.
bandleader,Hey! The Hebrew Hammer everybody!
esther,"So, do you come here often!?"
hammer,What was that!?
esther,"I said, do you come here often!?"
hammer,"Oh. Yeah, about once a week!"
esther,What!?
hammer,"I said, yeah, about once a week!"
esther,Oh!
hammer,I'm okay right now. Thanks though.
joshua,"Hey Morty, wanna cut a rug?"
hammer,"Nah, I'm good. I'm kind of here with somebody."
joshua,Oh. Okay. Maybe next time.
hammer,Yeah. Maybe next time Joshua. Take it easy.
chaim feygele,Well Shalom there mister!
hammer,Do we know each other?
chaim feygele,"No, but we have mutual friends."
hammer,Mordechai. My friends call me Morty.
chaim feygele,"So Morty, I just love a man in a black suit. Care to dance."
hammer,"Uhhh. You know, I...have to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back."
esther,Hey.
hammer,Do you want to get out of here?
esther,I would love to get out of here.
esther,Ouch!
hammer,Sorry. I'm better with men.
esther, Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
hammer,You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...Oh. I get it.
esther,Mordechai?
hammer,Yes Esther.
esther,I want you to talk dirty to me.
hammer,Oh. Okay.
esther,Keep going.
hammer,"Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism."
esther,"Oh god, yes! Keep going! Don't stop!"
hammer,"Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life."
esther,Kiss me you Semitic stud!
esther,"Wow, that was amazing."
hammer,Antihistamine. It's for my allergies. The capsules make me gassy.
esther,Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
hammer,"Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?"
esther,"Well, she also said that you need to find a nice girl to help take your mind off of your work. I'm just glad she thought I was good enough for you."
hammer,When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
esther,"Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so..."
hammer,What? You made a deal with my mother to sleep with me if I'd help you?!
esther,No. Of course...
hammer,What does that make you? What does that make me? And my mother. What does that make her?
esther,No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
hammer,Always meddling in my life. This is so typical of her.  But from you? I thought we had something good here.
esther,We do!
hammer,"I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore."
chief,"Hammer, it's the Chief. We've got ourselves a situation. Get yourself down here, I've got something you need to see."
chief,Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
hammer,What's up?
chief,"About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole."
santa,"And now my Hanukkah loving friends, I will reveal to you the true nature of my diabolical scheme."
tiny tim,"Merry Christmas everybody, and god bless us, everyone."
santa,End transmission.
santa,"Really? Good, good."
tiny tim,"No, it was the perfect level."
santa,"Thanks. Oh, did I tell you. I picked up that new KC and the Sunshine Band record that you recommended. You were right, it is good."
hammer,Looks like I got a plane to catch.
chief,"Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup."
hammer,"No way, it's too dangerous. Besides, my days of hooking are over."
esther,"You're not my bitch Mordechai. Please, you have to believe me."
chief,Did I miss something here?
hammer,It's a long story. I'll explain when I get back from saving the clock.
chief,Tail him. He's gonna need the help.
hammer,Do you speak English?
hammer,Chello.
hammer,Well what else do you have?
hammer,"Whatever it is, I'll take it."
head elf,"Go, go, go!"
elf flunky,Not sure. I think it was left over from an Israeli Robbie Kneivel television special. You want me to get rid of it?
head elf,"No time. Besides, it's not like someone's gonna jump their motorcycle into the building while we're inside."
tiny tim,You okay?
santa,No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
tiny tim,I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
santa,Who's the leader of this operation?
tiny tim,"Uh, he can't sir. The harnesses."
santa,"You gonna learn to guide this sled right? You gonna make sure your men follow suit? Because if I'm puking down chimneys come Christmas Eve, I'm gonna have your hide. We clear?"
santa,The Jewish Atomic Clock.
hammer,Uh. Can you just give me one second?
santa,Get him boys!
esther,Mordechai! Behind you!
hammer,What are you doing here?
esther,"Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone."
hammer,I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
esther,I forgive you.
hammer,Go check on the clock. I'll finish up here.
tiny tim,Uh oh.
santa,Get off of me you cripple!
tiny tim,What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.
esther,What's the matter?
hammer,I don't know. I'm feeling kind of tired.
santa,What's going on? Why'd he stop?
tiny tim,Maybe he ran out of ammo.
santa,Take a look.
tiny tim,"Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend."
santa,Resting?
tiny tim,It's Friday.
santa,What time is it?
tiny tim,I don't know. About sundown I guess.
santa,Why didn't I think of this? It's the Sabbath.
tiny tim,"You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?"
santa,"No dipshit, I want you to kill him."
tiny tim,Oh.
santa,Santa's gonna take the sled back to the North Pole and celebrate his victory with his new stocking stuffer.
hammer,Esther!
esther,Mordechai!
tiny tim,Take a look Hammer. The clock's already beginning to power down.
jamal,Merry Kwanzaa nigga!
chief,"Mordechai, you're back. The clock?"
hammer,"Still ticking. Thanks to the help from the Brothers at the KLF, Hanukkah's safe for now."
chief,That's wonderful!
hammer,It's Esther. Santa's got her.
chief,My Esther! Oh Mordechai.
hammer,"I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission."
mohammed,Asalam Alekem.
chief," Mordechai, by any means necessary, you bring my Esther back to me. Even if it requires using Judaism's most powerful weapon."
hammer,"Oh no, not the..."
chief,"Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands."
hammer,I know sir. I won't let you down.
mohammed,What's wrong with him?
hammer,He's still working out some identity issues.
hammer,"It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet."
mohammed,"I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years."
hammer,This is the year 5734. It's time the boys at the KLF got into the 58th century. Let me show you something.
mohammed,Cool. What's it do?
hammer,"Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter."
mohammed,"Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!"
hammer,"But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail."
mohammed,Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
hammer,Oh yeah. Take a look.
mohammed,Gettin' freaky with a what?
mohammed,What just happened?
hammer,Remember that bit about the cyber postal route?
mohammed,Yeah.
hammer,"Nah, forget about it."
santa,"Rudolph, more egg nog!"
santa,"Yes maam, loud and clear."
tiny tim,"Santa, I got some really bad news."
mohammed,What are you doing?
hammer,Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.
mohammed,I knew that.
mohammed,"Well, that was easy."
hammer,"Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system."
mohammed,A stereo type alarm system?
hammer,Take a look.
mohammed,How do we bypass it?
hammer,"The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound."
mohammed,"Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player."
hammer,Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.
mohammed,It's all clear. Let's go.
hammer,"Mo, I think you dropped some..."
mohammed,"Hammer, no!"
loudspeakers,Jewdar alert! Jewdar alert!
hammer,Let's go!
mohammed,What are you doing?
hammer,Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
mohammed,There's Tiny Tim.
santa,"Hey, what's that over there? Is that a bowl of Matzah Ball soup?"
hammer,Damn!
mohammed,Now I'm gonna do to you what I should have done earlier.
tiny tim,My crutches. Noooo. Not my crutches.
hammer,Where's my girlfriend Santa?
santa,I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
hammer,"But if I kill you, then you'll be dead."
santa,Good point.
hammer,Don't worry your pretty little head.
santa,Looks like the tables have turned once again Hammer.
hammer,"Wait! I didn't want it to come to this, but you leave me no choice. I have no other option but to use the most powerful weapon in the Jewish arsenal."
santa,What are you doing?
hammer,"I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?"
santa,"Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it."
hammer,What sort of host would treat company this way? Esther is clearly uncomfortable in your guest room. I'm shvitizing from running around shooting people. And my feet. What kind of flooring is this anyway? My arches are killing me.
santa,No. Stop it!
hammer,"And to top it off, you didn't even have the courtesy to give me a proper hello when I entered the room. What have I ever done to you to be treated with such disrespect?"
santa,"Please, make it stop. I'll do anything. Here take my gun."
mohammed,"Hammer, you alright?"
hammer,Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
hammer,Esther!
esther,Mordechai!
hammer,Joseph Lieberman?
joseph lieberman,Mordechai! Thank god you're here.
esther,You two know each other?
hammer,We go to the same temple.
santa,Please tell me. What is the true meaning of Hanukkah?
hammer,"That's...that's a very good question. And I do know that it does have something to do with...dreidels, and..."
esther,...and latkes.
hammer,"And latkes! And some miracle oil that lasted eight days. And that my friend, should've been enough for you. Take him away Mo."
santa,I'm sorry. I see the light now. I was wrong. I'm...
hammer,"Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal, will you marry me?"
esther,Yes! Of course! I'd gladly give up my last name to be with you.
joe lieberman,What happened out there?
hammer,"Well then maybe you should have thought about that before you ran with him. C'mon, let's get you back to Washington."
hammer,And a Merry Christmas to all of our Gentile friends. Mun Chi.
hammer,Thanks mom.
hammer," Well, I did save Hanukkah mom. My children, and my children's children, and my children's children's children..."
hammer,"...No, no, no, no, no. I see what you're doing here. So all of a sudden Hanukkah's not good enough for you, is that right?"
hammer,"...I'm not finished yet, mom."
hammer,Mom! We're eating!
hammer,"Oh, I get it. To you, the cat pooping in his diaper is somehow better than my saving a Jewish holiday.  Forget it."
esther,"Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL."
hammer,I think I hear the new Santa Claus busy at work. C'mon.
hammer,"Since Santa will be living out the rest of his days at a home for the religionally insane and because he had no blood heirs, the Kwanzaa Liberation Front and the Jewish Defense League agreed to make the whole Santa Claus process a democratic vote. We're all very pleased with the first Santa elect."
jamal,Merry Christmas Niggas!
