Speaker,Dialogue
sam, Mommy got sick and it happened  just like that and there was  nothing anybody would do.  
sam," If we start asking why we'll go  crazy.  So, rule number one.  We don't ask why."
annie," Why? I just want to know why?  That's my first rule.  I always  ask why.  Come on.  Tell me.  C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --"
seth," There's no why, Annie.  I'm  just not up for it.  I never  said I was."
annie, Is there somebody else?
seth, Nope.
annie," You don't love me, is that it?"
seth, Nope.
annie, How about ... you're too  narcissistic to commit to  another human being in a long-  term way.
seth,   That's good.
suzy," Five minutes in the microwave.  Any one of them, five minutes  and done.  Ready to eat.  Do  you know how to make juice?"
sam, Microwave.  Five minutes.
annie, You take the microwave?
seth, What am I going to do with a  microwave?
annie," You turn it on, you open it and  you stand in front of it for a  very long time."
seth, So you're angry.  Big deal.
rob," Young man, it's none of my  business, but maybe you should  talk to someone.  I myself  have consulted a professional.  I used to be up tight."
sam," Hypnotherapy...Shiatu Massage...  Loss of Spouse support groups...  Single parent discussion nights...  Parents without partners.    Partners without parents.  People who need people.  Guys  who go into the woods, beat  drums and bond.  Get a shrink.  Hug a friend.  Hug yourself."
sam,   What I really think is we need  a change.
rob," Good idea.  Take a few weeks  off, get some sun, take Jonah  fishing --"
sam,   A real change.  New city.  Someplace where every time I go  around a corner I don't think  of Maggie.
sam, I was thinking about Seattle.
laurie," Honey, he wasn't right for you."
annie,   I know.
laurie," He wasn't even wrong for you,  like cosmically wrong, so don't  beat up on yourself for  wasting...however long it was."
annie, I know.  
laurie, Maybe you should see a shrink.
annie, I want my money.
laurie, Go home for the weekend.
annie,   How does a blonde do a high-  five?
jonah,"   Dad says I'm going to get used  to it, but I don't think you  can ever get used to a  designated hitter."
suzy,"   Eventually, in a few months,  you'll start seeing women,  you'll meet someone."
sam," Move on.  Right.  That's what  I'm going to do.  In a few  months, boom, I'll be fine,  I'll just grow a new heart."
suzy, I'm sorry --
greg," Sam, she didn't mean --"
sam," I know, I know.    Look, it doesn't happen twice."
annie," I'm going to meet someone,  someone nice and stable who  wears a hat so he won't catch a  cold, and I'm going to marry  him and have three children  and live happily ever after.  I mean, I am not cut out for this  --"
diane, For what?
annie, For life as we know it.
laurie, Just make sure he isn't fat  like my Michael or you'll spend  your whole life worrying he's  going to drop dead.
judith," God, you guys are so romantic."
annie, Do you know how long romance  lasts?    That long.
diane, Steven still brings me flowers  every Friday and we've been  married 10 years.
laurie,"   Here, darling, have some Tic  Tacs."
annie, The next time you see me I am  going to be incredibly happy.
sam," I'm your dad.  Don't ever  forget that.  That's rule  number two.    It's you and me, kid."
annie,   I guess it's just us.
walter, The short one with black hair  is your cousin Irene --
annie, -- who's married to --
walter," Harold, who ran away with his  secretary but came back --"
annie, -- because Irene threatened to  put the dog to sleep if he  didn't --
walter, And your brother Tom is a  psychology professor and is  married to...Betsy --
annie, -- who is the most competitive  woman in the world --
walter," Your Uncle Milton lost all his  money in a Puerto Rican  condominium that went belly up,  don't mention the IRS or the  Federal prison system.  Your  mother is Barbara, your father  is Cliff --"
annie, I hope he doesn't get out his  slides.
walter, Am I what they had in mind?
annie, They're going to love you.
barbara, Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
annie, Walter and I are engaged!
irene," That's wonderful, Annie.  I  hope it lasts... for years  and years."
betsy,   Do you have a ring?
annie, No.  Not yet.
betsy, Oh.  Well.  How will anyone  know?
tom," Because you're going to call  them all and tell them.  Congratulations, Walter."
cliff, Are you all right?
walter, It's nothing.  Nothing.
annie, It's probably just the flowers --
barbara, We'll move them --
walter, Don't touch them.  I feel  terrible sneezing at a time  like this.  This is a big  moment for me --
annie,"   He's allergic to everything,  don't worry about it --"
harold, Bees.  I'm allergic to bees.
cliff, Not salmon I hope --
annie, If he eats one tiny piece of a  nut --
walter,   My head swells up like a  watermelon and I drop dead.
irene, It's the same with Harold and  bees.
cliff," Your mother and I had salmon at  our wedding, and I really think  a wedding without cold salmon --"
walter, I'm not allergic to salmon.  I  don't think.  But you never  know.
harold, You never know.
barbara," Oh, honey, I feel terrible, we  used up this magnum of  champagne we were saving on  something else, what did we use  it for?"
tom, Uncle Milton's parole --
barbara, Right.
uncle milton, And it was delicious.
barbara," It was, wasn't it, Milton  darling --"
betsy," When are you getting married,  Annie?"
cliff, In early June.  In the garden.
harold, Does it have to be in the garden?
irene, What about Harold and bees?
barbara, We'll spray you.
cliff, Cold salmon.  A lovely cucumber  salad.  Strawberries.
walter, I'm afraid I'm allergic to  strawberries.
cliff, No strawberries.
annie,   Is that all right with you?
walter,   Today I consider myself the  luckiest man on the face of  the earth.
irene, What are you wearing?
annie, I don't know.
betsy," I wish you would wear my dress.  I only wore it once, and you'll  barely have to do anything to  it except take it in in the  bust --"
barbara, I have something that might do  --
barbara, The Historical Society wanted  this and I never would give it  to them --
annie," Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom."
barbara," I notice these things are back  in fashion.  Oh, honey.    He's a lovely man, Annie."
annie," I know.  He's wonderful, isn't  he?"
barbara, Are his folks nice?
annie, You'll love them.  We're going  down to D.C.  tonight to be with  them Christmas morning.
barbara, How did it happen?
annie," It's silly, really.  I mean,  I'd seen him at the office,  obviously I'd seen him, he's  the associate publisher, and  then one day we both ordered  sandwiches from the same place,  and he got my lettuce and  tomato sandwich on whole wheat,  which of course he was allergic  to, and I got his lettuce and  tomato on white."
barbara,   How amazing.
annie," It is, isn't it? You make  millions of decisions that mean  nothing and then one day you  decide to order takeout and it  changes your life."
barbara, Destiny takes a hand.
annie," Oh, please.  Destiny's just  something we've invented  because we can't stand the fact  that everything that happens is  accidental."
barbara, Then how do you explain that  you both ordered exactly the  same sandwich except for the  bread? How many people in this  world like lettuce and tomato  without something else like  tuna?
annie, It wasn't a sign.  It was a  coincidence.
barbara," I was in Atlantic City with my  family.  Cliff was a waiter.  He talked me into sneaking out  for a midnight walk on the  Steel Pier.  I've probably told  you this a million times, but  I don't care.  And then he held  my hand.  I was scared.  All  sorts of thing were going  through my head.  But after a  while I forgot about them.  At  one point I looked down, at our  hands, and I couldn't tell  which fingers were mine and  which were his.  And I knew."
annie,   What?
barbara, You know.
annie,   What?
barbara, Magic.  It was magic.
annie,   Magic.
barbara," I knew we would be together  forever, and that everything  would be wonderful, just the  way you feel about Walter.  Walter.  It's quite a formal  name, isn't it?    One of the things I truly knew  was that your father and I were  going to have a wonderful time  ... in the sack I believe you  call it --"
annie, Mom!
barbara," Of course it took several years  before everything worked like  clockwork in that department,  so don't be worried if it takes  a while --"
annie," Mom, we already..."
barbara," Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da  dee.  And how's it working?"
annie, Like... clockwork.
barbara, So you'll get married in a new  dress.
annie, It's a sign.
barbara,   You don't believe in signs.
annie, They loved you.  I told you  they would love you and they  did.
walter, I love you.
annie," I love you, Walter.    Did anyone ever call you  anything other than Walter?"
walter, Nope.
annie, Even when you were young?
walter, Nope.  Not even when I was  young.
walter, You sure you don't want to  drive with me?
annie," How will I get back to  Baltimore Saturday?    Oh God, I forgot my present for  your stepmother -- I took it  inside by accident."
walter, I'll wait.
annie, Don't be silly.  I'll just be  ten minutes behind you.
annie, Give me a break.
radio voice, The subject of the evening's  medical update is You and Your  Spleen and our host --
radio voice," Coming up, Jingle Bells  backwards, sung by the New  Jersey Cape Mayettes --"
annie, I don't believe this --
annie, They lose their minds and call  crackpot doctors on the radio --
annie, Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
jonah, Dad --
sam, What is it?
annie, This is completely disgusting.
sam, Hello.
sam, I'm probably not interested in  whatever you're selling.
sam,   Who is this?
sam," Jesus, are we on the air?  Jonah, for God's sake --"
jonah," Don't be mad at me, Dad."
sam,"   I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm  not mad at you."
jonah, Please --
annie," This is a grotesque violation  of this man's personal life,  but never mind --"
sam, It's been about a year and a  half.
sam, No.
sam," Look, Doctor, I don't want to  be rude, but --"
annie, Sure you do.
sam," Look, we had a tough time at  first, but I think I'm holding  my own as a dad, and Jonah and  I will get along fine again as  soon as I break his radio."
jonah, Tell her how you don't sleep at  night.
sam, How do you know that?
jonah," I can hear you walking around  sometimes.  At first I thought  it was a robber.  Go ahead,  tell her, Dad."
sam, I don't think I have to now.
sam," Look, it's almost Christmas --    A kid needs a mother --"
annie, Yes.
annie, I'm losing my mind.
sam, What's she talking about?
jonah, This is where other people get  to call in and dump on what you  said.
loretta," I'll bet he's tall, with a cute  butt."
harriet, I'll bet he hasn't shaved in a  week.  I'll bet he stinks.
loretta," Shut up, Harriet.    What'll it be?"
annie," Coffee, please.  Black.  To go."
loretta, Maybe I should hustle myself  out to Seattle.  Give him a  little present for New Year's  Eve.
harriet, You can go there if you want  but don't open his refrigerator.  They don't cover anything when  they put it in the fridge.  They just stick it in and leave  it there till it walks out by  itself.
loretta," Harriet, ever since you  divorced your last husband,  you've been no fun.  I'm  looking, and this guy pops my  tarts."
truck driver," Come on, Loretta, you're going  to have to jump-start this guy.  His battery's dead.  And look  at me.  Mister Ever-Ready.  Every six minutes, another  charge."
loretta, I'm looking for someone  sensitive.
annie," Come on, nobody wants a guy  who's sensitive on the radio."
loretta,"   Honey, get on line."
sam," I don't know.  When I met my  wife, it was so clear.  I just  knew."
sam, I don't think I could really  describe it.
sam," And if I could describe it,  it probably wouldn't be on a radio  show.  "
sam," You touch her for the first  time, and suddenly... you're  home.  It's almost like..."
annie, Magic.
sam, Magic.
walter,   Annie?
walter, Annie?
annie," I'm sorry, Walter.  I just  heard the most amazing thing on  the radio."
annie," People call up these shows and  you can't believe the stuff  they say.  It's the end of  privacy as we know it, this  country is just one big global  village with everyone out there  going blah blah blah --"
sam," The hopes are perfect --  beautiful, identical, smooth --  and they are for something  really amazing I feel it in my  bones --"
jonah, It's a spice rack.
sam, We desperately need a spice  rack.  Desperately.
sam, And we desperately need spices.
jonah, Dad?  About last night?
sam, It's never happening again.  Right?
jonah, Right.
sam, Then it never happened.
sam, Hi.
lulu, Hi.  Sam?
sam, Yes?
lulu,   You must be Jonah.
lulu,   See.  I told you.  Sam and  Jonah.  I'm LULU.  This is  JoBeth.
lulu,"   We live two piers over, don't  we? Number 12, right? We're  having like a really neat open  house today from like four to  whenever if you care to stop  by."
sam," Thanks, but... we've got plans."
lulu," Well, here's the number.  If  you ever find yourself  Sleepless, give us a call.  We  also... do babysitting."
jonah, Not.
sam, My feelings exactly.
sam, How many people do you think  heard that thing last night?
jonah, It plays in 50 states.
sam, What?!
jonah, Nobody else is going to know it  was us.
sam, You're right.    You better hope so.
keith," This man sells the greatest  soup you've ever eaten, there's  a line around the block, and he  is, I am not kidding, the meanest  man in America.    I feel strongly about this,  Becky.  This is not just about  soup."
becky, Do it.  What else?
wyatt, New Year's Eve.  Please don't  make me write it.
becky," Wyatt, I do not mean to remind  you of your mother, but if you  don't put that game away, no TV  for a week."
wyatt,"   Would someone look this up,  don't tell me where."
becky, Listen to this.  Phone service  in the greater Chicago area was  tied up for two hours Christmas  Eve because some kid called a  phone-in show to get a wife for  his father.  Two thousand women  called in for the number.
keith, Jesus.
annie," I heard it.  This kid calls up  and says my dad needs a wife  and I'm talking to myself in  the car saying, this is  completely disgusting, you're  taking advantage of a child,  and then the father gets on and  this shrinkette says, do you  want to talk about it? And he  says no as a matter of fact I  don't, and I am saying, bravo!  Right on! Don't talk to her,  it's none of her business --    fell in love with her and I am  crying.  Me.  A tear is  actually rolling down my face.  It was like what happens when I  watch those phone company ads.  I don't have to see the whole  ad, I just have to see the part  where the daughter gives her  mother a refrigerator with a  big red bow on it, have you  seen that one?"
becky, You should write something  about this.
annie, About what?
becky, Whatever it is.
keith,"   What it is is, there are a lot  of desperate women out there  looking for love."
wyatt, Especially over a certain age.
keith, It is easier to be killed by a  terrorist after the age of 40  than it is to get married --
annie, That is not true.  That  statistic is not true.
becky," It's not true, but it feels  true."
annie, There's practically a whole  book about how that statistic  is not true --
wyatt, Calm down.  You brought it up --
annie,"   I did not, Wyatt."
becky, So where were we?
wyatt," New Year's Eve.  I'll do it,  okay?"
becky, Okay.
annie," If someone is a widower, why do  they say he was widowed? Why  don't they say he was widowered?"
annie, I was jus wondering.
becky, What was that about up there?
annie, What was what?
becky, What's with you?
annie, Nothing's with me.
becky," ""Sleepless in Seattle""?"
annie, That's what she called him on  the show.  Because he can't  sleep.
becky," And now 2,000 women want his  number.  The guy could be a  crackhead, a psychopath, a  flasher, a junkie, a  transvestite, a chain-saw  murderer, or someone really  sick, like Rick."
annie," Actually, he sounded nice."
becky," Oh? Oh, really? Now we're  getting down to it."
annie, Not.
bob langman, Now she wants a circular  stairwell off the den.
jay,   And she wants the Sub-Zero with  the side-by-side doors --
bob, Which means --
sam, The cabinets have to be redone  --
bob, So we thought --
jay, Since you're on the make again  --
sam," Great.  This is great.  The  whole town knows.  Just out of  curiosity, how do you two know?"
bob, Grace heard it.
sam, Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
bob," The point is, take the client  out to dinner and ask her to  marry you and then maybe we  won't have to redo the kitchen  cabinets."
sam, Why me? What about Jay?
jay," Hey, my plate is full."
sam," Well, okay.  What's the big  deal?  If she'll forget the  new fireplace, I'll marry her.  Just point me in the right  direction."
jonah," Dad, I don't know about this  one --"
sam," Oh, you're changing your mind  --"
jonah," No, I'm not, but --"
sam, What's the matter with this  one? Wouldn't you like to have  Imelda Marcos as your mother?
jonah, Dad --
sam, We better take the measurements  for the new cabinets.
bob," Sam, if you're not doing  anything New Year's --  obviously you're not doing  anything New Year's -- we're  having some people over, all of  them married, not one even  remotely interested in playing  around.  Does that sound great  or what?    I can't think of the last time  I was at a party when anything  actually happened."
sam," Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's  kind of a big night.  I don't  like to leave Jonah alone."
sam,   Does red pepper go under R or  P?
jonah, P.    Dad?
sam,   What?
jonah, I forgot to mention.  Jed  called --
sam," Just out of curiosity, do you  have any friends whose names  don't begin with a J?  I feel  like it was a failure of the  imagination on our part naming  you Jonah.    What is marjoram? Does anyone  know?"
jonah, Jed is having a slumber party  New Year's Eve and he invited  me.
sam, Fine.  Fine.
jonah, So I can go.
sam, Sure.    Looking good.
jonah, Shouldn't you have used a  toggle bolt?
sam, I think I know how to have a  spice rack.
sam, God fucking dammit!  Shit!  Fuck.  Piss.
sam,   I'm sorry.
sam, I'm sorry.  I'm just --
jonah, Stressed.
sam," Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm  sorry."
a voice, Can I have half your beer?
sam, Sure.
maggie, What did I used to say? Here's  looking at you? Here's mud in  your eye?
sam, Here's to us.  You used to say  here's to us.    Oh babe.  I miss you so much it  hurts.
walter," Happy New Year, darling."
annie, Happy New Year.
walter," I was thinking, I have to go up  to Boston for the AAP  convention and then visit  Winston-Hughes about switching  over our computers.  Why don't  we meet in New York for  Valentine's Day weekend?"
annie," Walter, I'd love to --"
walter, We'll stay at the Plaza --
annie, Go for a walk in Central Park --
walter, Go to the Symphony --
annie, We will?    I'll take you to the Russian  Tea Room for pelmeni.
walter, What is it?
annie," It's delicious, trust me."
walter, Does it have wheat in it?
annie, I don't think so.
jonah," Look at this, Dad.  They're  all for you --"
mailman," If you're having trouble  sleeping, you might want to try  drinking a glass of water from  the other side."
jonah, I thought that was for hiccups.
mailman, Does it work for hiccups?
jonah," For hiccups, a spoonful of  sugar, you hold it in your  mouth for a minute."
mailman, Really?
sam," Just out of curiosity, how did  they get our address?"
jonah," They called and asked for it.    ""Dear Sleepless in Seattle.  You are the most attractive man  I've ever laid ears on."""
sam, How did they get our phone  number?
jonah, You have to give them your  phone number or they won't let  you go on the air.
jonah,   What is that?
sam, Thank God.  Something you don't  know.  It's a single white  female.
jonah," This is no good.  She's looking  for someone French.  Or Greek.    ""Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I  live in Tulsa."" Where is that?  --"
sam, Oklahoma.  Do you know where  that is?
jonah, Somewhere in the middle.
sam, I'm not going to think about  what they're not teaching you  in school.  I am not going to  think about it.    Generally speaking I think we  should rule out people who  don't live somewhere near here  --
jonah, She's willing to fly anywhere.
sam, She looks like my third grade  teacher.  I hated my third  grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait  a minute! She is my third  grade teacher!
jonah," Dad, you're not taking this  seriously."
sam, This is not how you do it.    You want this on an English  muffin or a bun?
jonah, English muffin.  How do you do  it?
sam," You see someone you like, you  get a feeling about them, you  ask them if they want to have a  drink or --"
jonah, -- a slice of pizza --
sam," But not dinner necessarily on  the first date because by the  time you're halfway through  dinner you might be sorry you  asked them to dinner whereas if  it's just a drink, if you like  them you can always ask them  for dinner but if you don't you  can go home if you see what I  mean.    I wonder if it still works this  way."
jonah, It doesn't.  They ask you.
sam, I'm starting to notice that.
jonah, In the movies women are always  scratching up guy's back and  screaming and stuff.  When  they're having sex.
sam, Whose show was this on?
jonah, Jed's got cables.
sam, Go to sleep.
jonah," Kiss Howard.    G'night, Howard."
annie," I think I'm going crazy, Tom.  I really do.  Are you happily  married?"
tom,   What?
annie," I mean, why did you get  married? Was it all fireworks  and trumpets and --"
tom,   I got married because Betsy  said we had to break up or get  married.  So we get married.
annie," But when you met her, did you  believe she was the only person  for you? That in some mystical,  cosmic way, it was fated?"
tom," Annie, when you meet someone  and you're attracted to them,  it just means that your  subconscious is attracted to  their subconscious,  subconsciously.  So what we  think of as chemistry is just  two neuroses knowing that they  are a perfect match."
annie," I don't even know him.  But  I'm having all these fantasies  about a man I've never met,  who lives in Seattle."
tom, It rains nine months of the  year in Seattle.
annie," I know, I know.  I do not want  to move to Seattle.  But what I  really don't want to do is end  up always wondering what might  have happened and knowing I  could have done something.  What do you think?    It's just cold feet, isn't it?  Everyone panics before they get  married, didn't you?"
tom," Yes, I did."
annie," Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much  better just having blown this  off."
tom, Any time.
jay," Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda  ... She's a weightlifter, but  it's not like her neck is  bigger than her head or  anything --"
sam," I'm not asking you to set me  up, Jay.  That's not what I  need your help for.  I want to  know what it's like over there."
jay," And that's what I'm trying to  tell you.  What women are  looking over, okay? Pecs and a  cute butt."
sam," You mean, like, ""He has the  cutest butt""? Where did I hear  that recently?"
jay," Everywhere.  You can't even  turn on the news without  hearing about how some babe  thought some guy's butt was  cute.  Who the first babe to  say this was I don't know,  but it caught on."
jay, When's the latest time you were  out there?
sam,   Seventy... eight.
jay," Well.  Things are different.  First, you have to be friends.  You have to like each other.  Then you neck.  This can go on  for years.  Then you have  tests.  Then you get to do it  with a condom.    The good news is, split the  check."
sam, I don't think it could let a  woman pay for dinner.
jay, Great.  They'll have a parade  in your honor.  You'll be Man  of the Year in Seattle  Magazine.  Tira misu.
sam, What's tira misu?
jay, You'll find out.
sam, What is it?
jay, You'll see.
sam, Some woman is going to want me  to do it to her and I'm not  going to know what it is.
jay, You'll like it.
sam,   This is going to be tougher  than I thought.
sam, Jonah?
sam, Jonah?
sam, Jonah?
sam, Jonah?
jonah," Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica."
sam," It's nice to meet you, Jessica."
jonah," Dad, this is amazing.  If you  play this backwards, it says  ""Paul is dead."""
sam, I know.
jonah, How do you know?
jonah," Dad, could you close the door?"
jessica, H and G.    Hi and goodbye.
sam,   Get a life.
sam," Hi, Victoria?... It's Sam  Baldwin, I don't know if you  remember me.  Oh?  Well, great.  I was wondering if you wanted  to have a drink... Friday,  say... Dinner?... Sure, dinner  would be fine.  Sure.  Dinner."
annie, Now those were the days when  people knew how to be in love.
becky, You're a basket case.
annie,"   They knew it.  Time, distance,  nothing could separate them.  Because they knew.  It was  right.  It was real.  It was..."
becky, ... movie.    Read it to me.
annie,"   ""Dear Sleepless and Son..."""
becky, It sounds like the name of a  mattress store --
annie," ""I am not the sort of person  who listens to call-in radio  shows"" --"
becky, And this woman is a writer!  That's what everyone writes at  the beginning of letters to  strangers.
annie," I know that.  You think I don't  know that? ""I know that's a  dumb way to begin, but it's the  only way I can think of to  convey what happened to me the  other night when I heard the  two of you on the radio.  On  the other hand, maybe I'm just  losing my mind."""
becky, You are.  You're losing your  mind.  What about Walter?
annie, I'm going to marry Walter.  I  just have to get this out of my  system.
becky, Right.
annie, I should say something in this  about magic.
becky, What?
annie," I don't know.  I mean, what if  I never meet him? What if this  man is my destiny and I never  meet him?"
becky, Your destiny can be your doom.  Look at me and Rick.
annie,"   ""I want to meet you..."""
becky," ""On top of the Empire State  Building at sunset on  Valentine's Day."""
annie," Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New  York with Walter, I can squeeze  it in."
becky," You want to hear about destiny?  If my husband hadn't gone on a  diet, which caused me to leave  him, I would never have been on  that flight to Miami, and met  Rick, and ended up having sex  in the bathroom of a 727 with  that nob you slide that says  ""vacant-occupied, vacant-  occupied, vacant-occupied"" --  "
annie, You never told me you left your  husband because he went on a  diet.
becky,   He lost all the weight...  there.
annie, That's impossible.  A guy can't  --
becky, Can too.
annie, No.
becky, Yes.
annie, And then you left him? He lost  weight there and you left him?
becky, Plus he fell in love with a  temp.
annie," Listen to this, I love this  part --"
becky, Men never get this movie.
annie, I know.
becky, Do you think at the end of the  movie when she's in the  wheelchair they can still do  it?
annie, I always wondered about that  too.
sam," It's okay, it's okay.  I'm  here."
jonah, It was sinking.
sam, What was?
jonah, Our house.  There was water  coming in all the windows.
sam,   I remember sometimes you'd have  nightmares as a baby.  Your mom  would hold you and rock you and  sing you a song.
jonah, Bye bye blackbird.
sam, Is that what she used to sing?
jonah, I miss her.    What do you think happens to  someone after they die?
sam, I don't know.
jonah, Like do you believe in heaven?
sam," I never did.  Or the whole idea  of an afterlife.  But I don't  know any more.  I have these  dreams about... your mom... and  we have long talks about...  about you, and how you are,  which she sort of knows but I  tell her anyway.  So what is  that? It's sort of an afterlife,  isn't it?"
jonah, I'm starting to forget her.
sam," I know.  But she's here, Jonah.  Because I have you.  And as  long as I have you, I have your  Mom."
sam, I... uh... have a date with  someone Friday night.
jonah, Good.
sam, Did I ever tell you about the  time I ate a dog biscuit?
annie," Laurie, it's Annie.  Fine, I'm  fine.  Listen, I'm doing an  article on call-in radio shows.  Do you know anyone who works  for someone named Dr. Marcia  Fieldstone...?"
annie," I'm a writer for the Baltimore  Sun and I'm a friend of Laurie  Johnson's.  I'm doing a piece  on how people handle  bereavement and I understand  that you had a caller the other  night... I know you're not  supposed to, but Laurie said  you might, and I'll plug the  show and everything --  "
annie, Baldwin.
computer screen, Directory.  Enter password.  
annie, 
annie, I need to know about him  because... he's involved with  my sister...
annie, She has a pattern of getting  involved with losers... Once  she almost ran away with a  human cannonball from the  circus.
annie," No, I know that part --"
annie," No, no, no, it's more like, who  is he, does he have a sense of  humor, is he nice -- no forget  nice, I've got nice --"
annie," I'll tell you the truth, I  heard this guy on a call-in  radio show and I might not  marry the person I should marry  because I've become obsessed  with him."
annie, No.  Not remotely.  I just want  to find out about him.
geraldo, So how long have you been a  woman?
woman,   About two weeks.
clarise,   Pssst!
sam," Clarise, I'll be back by  midnight I'm sure --"
clarise, Whenever.
sam, This one's for both of us.
jonah,   Baltimore.
sam, I left the number of the  restaurant I'll be at if  there's any emergency.
clarise, Fine.
sam,   How do I look?
jonah,   Great.
sam, 
jonah,"   This is a good letter, Dad."
sam,   The heels on these shoes are  very large.  Why have I never  noticed this? The heels on  these shoes are grotesque.
jonah, Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
sam, Now I'm late.  Bye.
jonah, Listen to this --
sam," Not now, Jonah --"
jonah," Just this one part, okay?    ""I have been an excellent  third-baseman for as long as I  or anyone else can remember,  and I guarantee you will not  get one past me"""
sam," Jonah, I'm leaving --"
jonah," WAIT!!!    -- ""and while we're on the  subject, let's just say right  now that Brooks Robinson was  the best third baseman ever.  It's important that you agree  with me on that because I'm  from Baltimore.""  Dad, she  thinks Brooks Robinson is the  greatest."
jonah, Dad!
sam, Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson  is the greatest.
jonah, It's a sign.
sam," Oh, right."
sam, Come here.  I want to show you  something.
sam, Here is Seattle.  
jonah, She doesn't want us to go to  Baltimore.  She wants to meet  us in New York City on  Valentine's Day.  On top of the  Empire State Building.
sam, Perfect.  We'll be there.
sam, Hi.
victoria, Hi.
sam, You look good.
victoria, You look good yourself.
victoria, I thought you were never going  to call me.
sam, You did?
victoria," I really wanted you to call me,  and I thought you were never  going to --"
sam, You could have called me --
victoria, No way.  No way I was going to  be the first woman you went out  with after...    There is no percentage  whatsoever in being the first  woman anyone goes out with  after...
sam, You are the first woman I'm  going out with.
victoria, Oh.
sam," So whatdya say? I'll get the  check, and I'll call you in  eight months."
victoria," Oh, you are funny --"
annie," Tell me he's living in squalor.  Tell me everything he has is  being repossessed, including  his filthy, dented mobile home."
wheedle, He's got a houseboat.
annie, I hate boats.
wheedle, It sounds nice.
annie, Boats.  You go out in them.  You come back in them.  I hate  them.
wheedle, Houseboats don't go anywhere.
annie," Boats.  All anyone talks about  is the wind.  Is it up, is it  down.  I can't live with a man  who only talks about the wind."
wheedle, It's not a boat boat.  It's  really a house.
annie, But it's on the water.
wheedle, It's on the lake right in the  middle of Seattle.    It rains nine months of the  year in Seattle.
annie, I hope I don't have to pay for  that piece of information.
wheedle," No, that's free.  He's an  architect.  Used to do big  high-profile projects.  He  scaled it all back when his  wife died.  Now he remodels  people's homes.  He works in  a small firm, makes a good  living."
annie, He's real.
jonah," I figure we could go to New  York, catch the Knicks, and  since we'd be there anyway,  obviously we'd go to the Empire  State Building --"
sam, There she is.
jonah, Why is she bringing that bag?
sam, She's going to cook something  for us?
victoria," Hi, Sam.  And let me guess --  you must be Jonah."
jonah, Hi.    He should book now because we  can get an excursion fare.  Jessica's parents are travel  agents and --
sam," Not now, Jonah."
sam," We can't finish the job.  She's  on her sixth painter, now she's  thinking maybe she wants the  fireplace rebricked --"
victoria, I know her pretty well.  Maybe  I could call her --
sam, I've already solved it.  I've  hired a hit man.
victoria," Oh that is so funny, you are so  funny."
sam," Every time she wants to change  something, she talks in this  little baby voice --    ""Couldn't you just move the  stairway a teeny tiny bit?""--"
jonah, Do you like baseball?
victoria," Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has  box seats for the Mariners.  Why don't we all go next week?"
jonah, What about camping?
victoria, What about it?
jonah, Do you like it?
victoria, I went camping once.    I love to brush my teeth in a  brook and floss with a weed.
jonah," We ought to start camping  again, Dad."
sam," Okay, tiger.  Time for bed."
jonah, It's only ten o'clock.
sam,   Jonah!
jonah, Okay.
sam, Thank Victoria for dinner.
jonah, Thanks for dinner.  I never saw  anybody cook potatoes that way.
sam,"   I'm glad you liked it.  Good  night, Jonah."
annie,   Hello.
becky,   Turn on your radio!
annie, What?
becky,"   The kid is on.  You've got me  listening to this garbage.  Go on, turn it on."
walter, Who is it?
annie," Oh, it's just Becky, she's  having trouble with Rich again.    Hold on, Becky, I'm going  downstairs."
annie, How am I going to explain this  to Walter?
jonah," Please, please don't make me  sick.  He's not sane enough to  judge anything.  She's a ho."
victoria, Is he there?
sam,"   After he was born, every time  we started to make love, he  would cry.  He had an uncanny  sense of timing.  We really  shouldn't do anything here  anyway."
victoria, Absolutely.  Right.
jonah," Oh God, it's major.  He's  kissing her on the lips.  I  have to stop this."
annie,"   Come on, Jonah --"
jonah," Yes, I can."
walter, Miss Scarlett.  In the broom  closet.  With the radio.
annie,"   Walter, you scared me.  Don't  ever do that again."
sam, Don't ever do that again.
jonah, I thought I saw a black widow  spider.
sam, What are you doing up?
jonah, I was thirsty.
sam, There's a bathroom upstairs.
jonah, The water tastes better in the  kitchen.
sam, That's true.  Why is that?
annie," Becky heard this woman on the  radio complaining about this  guy she was sure was Rick,  which meant he was cheating on  her.  She was completely  hysterical.  Then it turned out  the woman lived in Duluth."
walter, That doesn't make any sense.
annie, I know.  It makes no sense at  all.  Thank God my life is in  place.
jessica, Write her.
jonah, You think so?
jessica, It's Y. O. H.
jonah,   What's that?
jessica, Your only hope.
annie, I thought I would look into  doing a story about those radio  shows.
becky,   You'd probably have to go  somewhere to really look into  it.
annie, Definitely.
sam,   Get in the car right this  minute.
jessica, I'll call you later.
sam, Did you call that radio station  again?
jonah, No.
sam, Everyone at work heard you.
jonah, I just called for a second.
sam, Long enough to call Victoria a  ho.
jonah, It's a short word.
sam, This is not a joke.  Thank God  Victoria doesn't know.  It  would really have hurt her  feelings.
jonah,"   If she knew, she'd never  forgive me.  It would be  hopeless for the two of you."
walter, Couldn't you just do a phone  interview?
annie, Not for the kind of place I  want to do.  I won't be in  Chicago that long.
walter," When you get back, I'll be  gone --"
annie, And then I'll see you in New  York --
walter," Okay, okay."
pilot's voice, This is Captain Foster  welcoming you aboard Flight 132  to Seattle.  Our flying time  today...
annie," Do you believe that any lie is  a betrayal? That's what Harold  Pinter says, but it seems to me  it's a very harsh way of  drawing the line."
victoria,   You know -- you shake them up  and the snow floats down?
jonah,   Sure.  I'd really like that.  Thank you so much.
victoria, Well...
jonah, I think they're announcing your  flight.
sam, He's ten.
victoria,   He's good at it.
sam, I read an article about this  ...
victoria, I read the same article...
sam, It takes time --
victoria," Absolutely.  When I come back,  maybe the two of us should  spend some time together, on  our own.  What do you think?"
sam, Sure.  Sure.
sam,"   Jonah, this isn't fair.  You  don't know Victoria.  I hardly  know her myself.  She is, in  fact, a mystery to me.  She  tosses her hair a lot.  Why  does she do this? I have no  idea.  Is it a twitch? Does  she need a haircut? Should she  use barrette so it doesn't  keep falling in her face?  These are things that I'm  willing to get to the bottom  of, and that is why I am dating  her.  That is all I am doing.  I am not marrying her.  Can you  appreciate the difference?  That's what single people do,  they try people on and they see  if they fit.  But nobody fits  perfectly, everyone is an  adjustment."
jonah, Was Mom an adjustment?
sam,   I'm never going to meet anyone  who's going to measure up to  your mom in your eyes? What do  you think? There's a perfect  woman walking around out there?
sam, There's no such thing as a  perf --
sam,"   God, she's beautiful."
jonah,   Victoria? She's okay.
jonah," Dad, I was talking to Jessica  about reincarnation, and she  thinks that probably you knew  Annie in another life."
sam,   Who is Annie?
jonah, The one who wrote us.
jonah,"   But Jessica says you and Annie  never got together in that  life, and your hearts are like  puzzles with parts out of them  and when you get together the  puzzle's complete."
sam, God dammit.
jonah, The reason I know this and you  don't is that I'm younger and  purer so I'm more in touch with  cosmic forces.
sam, I sincerely hope you are not  going to marry Jessica.
annie,   I'm Annie Reed.
annie," I heard about you calling Dr.  Fieldstone, and well, I just  happened to be out here on..."
annie,   business...
annie,   vacation...
annie,   say hello...
annie,   invite you to lunch...
annie,   take a shower with you...
annie,   shoot myself.
annie, I couldn't do it.  How did I  get here?
becky, You told a lie and got on a  plane.
annie, That's not what I mean.    I'm going back over there  tomorrow and talk to him.  I  am.
becky, Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
annie, Becky?
becky, What?
annie, Is this crazy?
becky, No.  That's the weirdest part  about it.
annie, Thank you.  I love you.
becky," I love you, too."
annie, Good night.
sam," God, it's wonderful to see you.  Where's Greg?"
suzy, He's over at the boat show.  He'll be by later.    It's so beautiful here.
driver," Lady, what the hell are you  doing?"
sam, Hello.
annie, Hello.
becky, You were standing in the middle  of the street?
annie, You know that dream where  you're walking down the street  naked and everyone is looking  at you?
becky, I love that dream.
annie," That was nothing compared to  this humiliation, nothing."
becky," But he saw you, right?"
annie, He said hello.
becky, And what did you say?
annie, All I could think of to say was  hello.
becky, It's a sign --
annie," It's a sign I've watched this  movie too many times.    I'm so stupid.  From the minute  I listen to that stupid program  on the radio, I've been a  complete jerk."
becky," You don't know who she was,  Annie --"
annie, I saw her.  She looked just  like this --
becky, This is a photo of hair.
annie," Well, it's the same woman.  And  he was crazy about her.    This is from Seattle."
annie, Becky?
becky, So I mailed your letter.
annie,"   ""Dear Annie: Thanks for your  letter.  It was great.  We're  very excited about meeting you  in New York on Valentine's Day  and seeing if we are M.F.E.O.  Sleepless in Seattle."""
becky, M.F.E.O.?
annie, Made for each other.
becky, It's cute.  It's like a little  clue.
becky,"   So he can't write.  Big deal.  I mean, verbal ability is a  highly overrated thing in a  guy, and our pathetic need for  it is what gets us into so much  trouble."
annie,"   I'm going to run back to  Walter's arms, if he's still  have me."
becky, What about the letter?
annie, It doesn't mean anything.  It  was written before I went out  there.  Before the ho.
suzy, You saw her in the airport and  then here?
sam, I tried to talk to her...    It was like I knew her.  Weird.
greg," Well, at least you're out there  seeing people again.  That's  terrific."
sam," Well, just one really."
suzy, How's Jonah taking it?
sam, It'll take him a while to come  around.  A month ago he called  one of those radio call-in  shows and told them I needed a  wife --
suzy,   You're kidding --
sam," Now that I'm seeing someone,  it's a whole other thing."
sam, He's become obsessed with  some woman who wrote me --
greg, Are you serious?
sam, She wants to meet me at the top  of the Empire State Building.
suzy, It's a little derivative.
sam, What do you mean?
suzy," ""An Affair To Remember."" Did  you ever see it? Cary Grant  and Deborah Kerr.  Before that  it was called ""Love Affair With  Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."""
greg, Women love this movie.
suzy," They met at the Empire State  Building, only they didn't.  Never mind."
greg, What kind of person would write  to someone they heard on the  radio?
sam, I got hundreds of letters from  women all over the country --
greg, Desperate women --
suzy, Just because someone's looking  for a nice guy doesn't make  them desperate.
greg, How about rapacious and love-  starved?
suzy, No.
greg, It is easier to be killed by a  terrorist --
suzy, It is not --
greg," Right, right."
sam," Anyway, Victoria's nice."
suzy, Would you follow her through an  airport?
sam," Look, I met somebody.  She's  good, and capable and smart.  We hit it off.  We can't spend  your life chasing after  fantasies."
annie, Hi.
sam," Hi.    So far so good.  So.  What  should we talk about? How  insecure we were in high  school.  Shirley Votypka, the  first girl I ever felt up.  Health.  What about health?  Did you know that eating six  macadamia nuts is the  equivalent of eating a steak?"
annie, Shhhh --
becky, You're going to miss the train.
annie," No, I'm not.  "
becky, What are your plans in New  York?
annie, We're going to the Rainbow Room  and the symphony tomorrow night.
becky, I love the symphony.
annie,"   Please don't tell anyone about  what happened.  ""Sleepless in  Seattle"" is history."
jessica,   This is the best movie I've  ever seen in my life.
jonah, I don't get it.
jessica," You have to go to her, Jonah.  You have to find her."
jonah, Do you know how much it costs  to go to New York?
jessica, Nobody knows.  It changes  practically every day.  How  much money do you have?
jonah, Eighty dollars.
jessica," I have forty-two.  So that  would definitely cover  taxicabs, I think."
jonah, But how am I going to get  there?
jessica's mother," Honey, I'm going out for a few  minutes.    Could you keep an eye on things  out front till I get back?"
jessica, Sure.
jessica, Do you want an aisle or a  window seat?
jonah, Window.
jessica, Do you want a fruit plate?
jonah, I don't know.  Do I?
jessica,   I'm telling them you're twelve  so you can fly unaccompanied  and they won't make you be  carried around by a stewardess  and everything.
annie, You go.
walter," Ever since Christmas, you've  been different.  Kind of  distracted, distant.  But I  feel like you're coming back  from wherever you were."
annie," I am.    I was just... I just got... I  think I got nervous.  It's  normal, right? Don't you ever  feel nervous about, you know?"
walter, What?
annie, About forever.
walter, No.
annie," Well, I did.  And you know what  I think? I think that it was  almost... too perfect."
annie," I started to wonder whether we  were the human equivalent of  two rights making a wrong, you  know?"
annie," It was like kismet but not, if  you see what I mean."
annie,   You have to grow up.  You can't  have all these adolescent  dreams about how exciting your  life is going to be --
annie,   Don't hate me but I love this  pattern.
walter, You couldn't.
annie, I do.
walter, It's just like my grandmother's  china.
saleswoman, How many place settings should  I put down?
walter, Exactly.  Eight is too few and  twelve is too many.
annie, Walter.
walter, It was my mother's.
annie, It's so beautiful.  It's just  what I would have picked out if  I'd had every ring in the world  to choose from.    Surprises are highly overrated.
annie,"   Promise me something, Walter.  Promise me you will never have  a surprise party for me.  Ever.  You know what happens, you walk  in the door in some horrible  sweater you put on that morning,  and there are hundreds of people  in their best clothes shouting  ""Surprise!"""
sam, Have you seen my wallet?
jonah, It might be in the kitchen.
sam," I'm only going to be away one  night, okay, and Clarise will  be here.  You'll have a swell  time.  You'll watch a little  Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm  Street 12, I'll never know."
jonah, Are you going with her?
sam, Yes.
sam, I have to have a life.  I have  to do things that I want with  people my own age.  It's none  of your business who I am going  out with.  I don't give a good  goddam if you're angry --
jonah,   This is the one I like.
sam, I don't care who you like.  It's who I like.  But the truth  is you're never going to like  anyone because it isn't your  mother.
jonah,   Fine.  I won't say anything.  You can marry Count Dracula.
sam," Thank you, Jonah.  But the  point is, I am not asking  permission."
jonah,   What's wrong with Annie?
sam,   Shut up.
jonah, Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never  did that.  Mom never said shut  up to me.  Mom never yelled at  me.
sam, This conversation is finished.
jonah, You said we could go to New  York.
sam, Did not.
jonah, Did too.
sam," I can't know what I said, but  we're not going."
jonah,   I'm not leaving this room until  you say yes.
sam, Get out.
jonah, No.
sam," Goddammit, I am sick of this  --"
jonah," Put me down.  I hate you, I  hate you --"
sam, I'm sick of this phony  melodramatic bullshit.  I'm  sick of it.
sam," Jonah?  Clarise is here, okay?  And I'm leaving."
sam, Jonah?    He's probably still asleep.
ticket clerk, Next.
jessica's mother," Jessica, this is not  acceptable."
jessica's father," If you don't tell us right now,  right this minute, I'm going to  kill you."
jessica, He's on his way to New York.
jessica's mother, What?
sam, How?
jessica,  
jessica's mother, Jessica!
sam, When does it leave?
jessica's father, Eight-thirty.
stewardess," Here you go... here's a nice pin  for you, for flying with us."
jonah,   Thank you.
stewardess, You're welcome.  Can I take  that for you?
jonah,   No.
sam,"   He's about this high, 90  pounds, never combs his hair,  Mariner's hat --"
airline clerk,   Anyone check in a  unaccompanied minor on the New  York flight?
sam, I'll kill him.    I have to get to New York as  fast as I can.
airline clerk, We can get you on a flight to  Chicago and you can change  planes --
airline clerk, How will you be paying for  this?
sam,   I really am going to kill him.
taxi driver, Where to?
jonah, Empire State Building.
sam,   Come on... come on... come on...  COMEONCOMEONCOMEONCOMEONCOMEON...
cabbie's voice, There it is.
cabbie," What are you gonna do there,  spit off the top?"
jonah, No.  I'm gonna meet...    my mother.
walter, Is something wrong.
walter, Some champagne?
annie," Fine, fine."
walter," Beautiful view, isn't it?"
annie," Walter, there's something I  have to tell you --"
sam," Sorry, this is an emergency."
jonah," Hi, I'm Jonah.  Are you Annie?"
jonah," Excuse me, are you Annie?"
sam, You're my family.  You're all  I've got.  What if something  happened to you?
sam, What if I couldn't get to you?
jonah, I was scared of what you were  gonna do.
sam, When I found you?
jonah, If I didn't go.
sam," Listen, have I ever done  anything really stupid?"
jonah, No.
sam," I mean, so far, have I screwed  it up for you?"
jonah, No.
sam, I can't believe you flew first  class.
jonah, It was all they had.
annie," I don't know what to say about  it, Walter.  It was a form of  temporary insanity.  But I had  to tell you about it because --"
walter,   -- it was a betrayal.
annie, Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It  was just...
walter, So what happened?
annie, I told you.  Nothing --
walter, At the top of the Empire State  Building --
annie, I'm not at the top of the  Empire State Building.  I'm  here.
walter," Not really.    I have a life insurance policy,  I'm fully invested in growth  stocks, I have a paid  subscription to Home Rox  Office, I have no sexual  diseases, I have been steadily  employed in a part of the  economy that isn't soft, I have  expectation in the way of  inherited wealth, I dress  nicely, I am a member of the  private sector, an independent  voter, I don't watch Monday  Night Football, the only thing  wrong with me is that I am  allergic to wheat,  strawberries, penicillin,  pollen, nuts and wool.  There  are plenty of women who see me  as the brass ring.  If you  don't -- marriage is hard  enough without bringing such  low expectations into it, isn't  it?"
annie," Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve  you."
walter, I think that's what I'm saying.
annie, You okay?
