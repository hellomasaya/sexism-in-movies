jack,"Yes, I'm the pilot...  ... I'm not even asking for your phone number... BUSINESSMAN Isn't there a pilot whose name is Paul?"
jack, Yeah... Are you Jim? BUSINESSMAN Yeah. He hands Paul a man's purse. BUSINESSMAN Here's your cash. PAUL What about the stuff? BUSINESSMAN I don't have it. We've got problems. Too much heat. Too
businessman,"I mean shut up and listen. Two guys will be waiting for you in a black T-Bird, expecting the dope. Just ignore them. It'll be delivered to you on Sunday and picked up the following Thursday, okay? PAUL But I won't be home, I'll be in the air for two weeks. BUSINESSMAN That's your problem. Make arrangements, a deal's a deal. Got it!? PAUL Got it. Jack returns. JACK  I got her phone number!   She gave me her phone number! BUSINESSMAN That's some magnificent view, isn't it? JACK It's wonderful -- Life is wonderful! The Businessman goes back to his seat and Jack grabs hold of the microphone. JACK This is your captain speaking. In honor of your victory, in honor of your beauty, and in honor of Jane, the most beautiful gymnast I have ever met. I'm going to give you a little demonstration of aviation gymnastics -- reserved only for the most important guest, hip, hip... Everyone shouts ""HOORAY!"" except for Paul and the"
jack,"God, what a woman! Paul is nervous, glancing uneasily from car to car. JACK Wanna share a cab? Paul Yeah, sure! A black Ford pulls up in front of them and its driver looks at Paul who immediately turns his back on him. JACK She's so beautiful! I've never been so in love before. Can you believe she gave me her phone number... Oh, Christ -- where is it?... Oh, no, don't tell me I lost it... It's a matter of life and death... Oh here it is -- thank God! All the while    Jack has been rambling on, a beige car on the other    side of the street has slowed down. Paul notices it.     In the beige car, a narcotics agent, GRATON, is behind the    wheel with one of his colleagues sitting beside him. GRATON They're slowing down.    Take a picture. The colleague snaps a picture of everyone who happens to be standing near the black Ford, including Jack and Paul. The black Ford pulls out. The beige car follows it. Paul observes all this out of the corner of his eye. PAUL Listen, I need a favor, I got"
peter," He's around somewhere.     Check under all the couches. Paul walks off in Jack's direction. We STAY WITH Peter, who reaches Natalie. She is talking with a very styl- ishly-dressed, tall, young man, CARL."
peter,"Oh Natalie, I've been looking for you all night. CARL All night? I just saw you deep in conversation with Nicole! PETER Deep? Hell no, we were just talking shop. NATALIE Oh come on Peter, we all know what a ladies' man you are. PETER Who, me? Jack's the ladies' man, not me. You're the only lady I'm after. CARL  So tell me, how's your project coming along? I heard you're not ready yet. PETER We've still got two weeks left before the semi-finals. We'll be ready. CARL We've been ready for three days now. We're gonna kick your ass. NATALIE Their project is really incredible. PETER Oh really?   You've seen it?"
natalie," No, it's top secret but he's been telling me about it..."
peter," ... Please darling, don't move... I'll be right back, okay? I'll bring us back some champagne... He disappears with Paul. JACK You're a lifesaver, Paul. I thought I'd never get away. Rosalie's waiting for me in the living room. Isn't she terrific? PAUL Who?   Rosalie? JACK Clementine. PAUL Oh yeah, for sure, I dunno. Listen, can you do me a favor? With some difficulty, Paul follows Jack as he picks his way through the people dancing, heading in Rosalie's direction."
jack,"Yeah... What kind of favor? Damn, I've got to get her a glass of champagne. PAUL Listen, I've got a little problem. I'm having a valuable package delivered to me on Sunday, but I'm not going to be home. I've got to do the Hawaii-Tahiti-Australia route, so can I have the package delivered here instead? JACK  But it's okay. Peter and Michael will be here. They'll take care of it. PAUL Will you be sure to tell them about it? JACK Absolutely.   Don't worry about a thing. PAUL It'll be delivered Sunday and picked up next Thursday, okay? JACK Delivered Sunday picked up Thursday. Got it. No problem. PAUL This is a very delicate matter, Jack. It's very important they don't tell anybody about this package. It could be very... uh, embarrassing for me, you know what I'm saying? JACK Sure. You got it.    I'll see you later..."
jack,"Okay, sure, not to anyone at all... Look, I'm sorry Paul, but I gotta get back to Rosalie. Now go have a good time. I'll take care of everything. PAUL Bye and thanks a lot."
jack,"Don't mention it. Paul leaves. Jack finally reaches the armchair where Rosalie is sitting. He stops short, obviously disappointed. JACK Uh-oh.   Too late. Michael is sitting next to Rosalie, right next to her. They get up to dance. As he passes Jack, Michael smiles broadly. MICHAEL All's fair, old buddy... Jack watches a moment, then breaks into a wide smile. JACK  Oh my darling, oh my darling, oh my darling Clementine. Jack whirls around and heads back towards Clementine."
carl," Terrific... time. He, too, leaves the living room and runs into Jack, who has his arm around Clementine's waist as he heads toward his bedroom with her.  5   INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT                                     5 In the kitchen Peter is straightening up. Michael joins him, dumping the ashes. Peter begins washing the glasses. PETER Where's Jack?    Did he leave? MICHAEL No, he's cuddling up with a blonde named Clementine... PETER That's not Clementine. I saw him doing his famous routine with Christie... "
michael,"No, it is Clementine, the one with the tits this big... PETER Christie's got tits that big, too... MICHAEL Yeah, but he was with Christie at the beginning of the evening -- after that he was with Rosalie and then with Clementine. And since I stole Rosalie away from him... Are you following this?"
peter,"I'm not. Jack enters the kitchen in very high spirits, singing. JACK Nice work if you can get it, and you can get it if you try... Any scotch left? PETER Yeah, here, I just put it away. JACK Sorry I can't give you guys a hand, but I've got something cooking. PETER I thought you were leaving at dawn for South America? JACK I am, the night's still young!... It's gonna be a lively one. I'm gonna make us a little snack. He makes up a tray with sandwiches. MICHAEL So, who is it anyway -- Christie or Clementine? JACK Maxine.    Beautiful, enchanting Maxine. Peter and Michael look at one another surprised, mouthing silently, ""Maxine?"""
jack,"Hey, Michael -- how'd it go with Rosalie? MICHAEL Well, things were going great until... JACK Your old friend Sophia appeared and dragged you into a thrilling conversation about modern art and in the meantime Rosalie took off with someone else. MICHAEL How did you know? JACK I dunno -- lucky guess... MICHAEL Well, I don't give a damn anyway, I have 24 drawings to hand in to my editor three days from now and I gotta work all night anyway... So it was all for the best. But you better not leave that Maxine's phone number lying around because when I'm done... JACK Don't worry, I'll leave you her phone number on the hall table. If she's really terrific I'll put a big 'X' next to it. 'Bye, guys -- love ya. I won't wake you tomorrow morning. See you in three weeks..."
jerry,"Of course, it's a piece of shit, but it's a ready piece of shit. JAY We're just going to have to buckle down, that's all. JERRY You're damn right we are. Starting now, everybody works around the clock! Everybody! We have two weeks to be ready for the semi- final selection. And we will be ready. And we will win. You want to know why we'll win? JAY Because we're gonna cheat. PETER I'll go bribe the judges! JERRY I don't think this is a joking matter, gentlemen. PETER Come on, Jerry... A SECRETARY enters. SECRETARY There's an urgent call for you, Peter. PETER I'm not in."
secretary,It's Jack -- he says it's 'super important...' Peter picks up the phone.
peter,"Hi... yeah... listen, make it quick, I'm in a meeting here... yeah, a package... okay... someone'll drop it off Sunday and pick it up Thursday... No problem ... yeah... we'll put it aside, okay... no, no, we won't tell anybody about it... Is that it?... Right, we won't tell anyone... Hey -- love 'n' kisses to the Brazilian girls, vaya con dios, old buddy. Peter hangs up, laughing.    Jerry gives him a dirty look. PETER What?"
peter,"No shit.  'Dearest Jack, here is the fruit of our love. Take good care of her. I have to go to Europe and Japan for six months, her name is Mary. Good luck, Love, Sylvia.' MICHAEL What are we going to do with it? PETER Give it back to her mother, that's what. MICHAEL But it says she went to Europe. PETER Well, we'll see about that, d'you have her phone number? MICHAEL Whose phone number? SYLVIA The girl's... Sylvia's... MICHAEL Why the hell would I have her number? I've never even heard of this chick! PETER You mean you don't know who she is? MICHAEL No way. If I had to keep track of all Jack's girlfriends, I'd have to be a full-time secretary. PETER Well, what are we gonna do? MICHAEL Hey, look, she's waking up... Hey, look, she's crying... PETER Oh no, this can't be happening! She's not gonna start to cry now?! MICHAEL"
michael,Soft stuff... I guess. PETER  Let's call Jack's mother!
peter,"She lives in Miami for Christsake. She can't stop the baby crying from Miami. MICHAEL Well, just to ask her advice... PETER No, he said not to tell anyone... MICHAEL But this is an emergency! PETER No! No way! You know what a pain that woman is -- she'll be on the next plane here to move in with us... MICHAEL Maybe I should call my mother... PETER No, please -- leave the mothers out of this, okay?! It's only four days. We should be able to handle that, besides you know the rule around here: it's fine to have a woman over once in a while, but... Michael finishes the sentence in unison with him. PETER AND MICHAEL ... never for more than one night at a time! PETER And that includes mothers! Peter steps over the basket and heads towards the elevator. MICHAEL Where are you going?! PETER I'm going to the store to buy some baby food. MICHAEL What am I supposed to do while you're gone? PETER Pick her up and hold her."
michael," Whaddya mean, pick her up? I've never held a baby -- I'll drop her!"
store clerk,"Depends on what your pediatrician recommends. PETER Oh right, the pediatrician... But which one sells the most? STORE CLERK  This kind. PETER Oh, so this is the best kind?"
store clerk,"It's the cheapest. PETER Then it's the worst kind? STORE CLERK They're all good, sir. PETER  Oh, okay, well I'll take this kind then. STORE CLERK That kind doesn't have any milk in it."
peter,"Oh, I see, there's milk with no milk in it? STORE CLERK Some babies are allergic to milk."
peter,"So what's the stuff that no babies are allergic to? STORE CLERK Soy formula. PETER Oh, okay, I'll take the soy formula."
store clerk, Is she teething? PETER Teething? WOMAN #1 Does she drool? Does she cry all night long? Does she chew on her fists? Does she put everything into her mouth? She acts out her words. PETER I know she can't talk. WOMAN #2
manager,This package came for you... Oh! What a cute little baby! Is it yours?
michael,"No, it's not me, I mean she's not mine... MANAGER Oh, so it's Peter's? MICHAEL No, no, it's Jack's, I mean it's not Jack's, it's... someone loaned it to us, I mean someone... MANAGER And what's the little girl's name? MICHAEL Mary. MANAGER Ooh, what a pwetty wittle name, Mary! I didn't know you had a baby... MICHAEL Yeah, well, I have to put her to bed now. MANAGER You have to put her to bed?    Where's Mary's mommy? MICHAEL She's... she's not here.   She'll be back soon. Michael starts to close the door.    She pushes it back open and holds out the package. MANAGER Oh here, this just came for you. They just dropped it off. Can I hold her for a second? MICHAEL Well, like, y'see... she doesn't like to be held by strangers... The apartment Manager has already given Michael the package and grabbed Mary. She covers her with kisses. Mary smiles. Michael absent-mindedly looks at the package."
manager,"She loves to be held by strangers! Hey, she's soaking wet hmm, no I think it's number 2. Want me to give you a hand changing her?"
michael,"Oh no, don't worry, I'm used to it.  Well, so long, Mrs. Razzolini. MANAGER 'Bye, Mary, I'll come back to visit."
peter,"To figure out how old she is so we know what to feed her, that's why. Peter attempts to look into Mary's mouth but she squirms. MICHAEL Do you look on top or bottom? PETER How do I know? MICHAEL Try feeling with your finger. Peter slides his finger over Mary's gums. PETER I can't feel anything -- I'll give her the stuff for newborns and hope she's not allergic to it. Peter starts off toward the kitchen, Michael follows. PETER And then we'll    have to  see if she's allergic    to iron,  to soy or to milk --    you can't  imagine how much stuff    they can  be allergic to! MICHAEL She's soaking wet -- did you buy any diapers? PETER Diapers? MICHAEL"
peter,"Go ahead... No, not on the towels, they're all covered with crap... Michael lays Mary down right on the couch. Peter vigor- ously undoes the tape, and the whole PLASTIC lining RIPS apart. PETER ... What the hell is this friggin' mess? Oh, man, this is unbelievable! To think, they bombard us day and night with their goddamn TV commercials! And will you look at this junk? This stuff is pure shit -- You tape it closed, it sags, you undo the tape: bingo -- the whole goddamn thing falls apart! MICHAEL  Oh shit! Now she's pissing. Look at the couch. The sneaky little bitch was just waiting for me to get the diaper off, then whammo... Mary gives them a big smile. PETER I happen to like my furniture. I'm going out to get some real diapers.  You can clean the couch up in the meantime. He exits, slamming the door."
peter," Hey, hey, hey, I'll work round the clock all weekend long... I swear, Jerry, I am not lying to you..."
michael," ... Mr. Oxman? Hello, Mr. Oxman?"
michael,She could have at least given us a phone number or the name of someone to contact... PUNK #1  I don't get it. Didn't they tell you we were gonna be here today?
michael,"Sure they told us! So what? That doesn't make the last four days any less hellish than they were! PETER Well, anyway, they're here now, that's all that matters! Peter turns and walks toward the basket. PETER The next bottle's in 45 minutes. I made it already. It's in the basket. PUNK #1 Bottle?   Whadda ya mean, bottle? MICHAEL About an hour after her bottle, she starts yawning. Put her to bed right away or it's pure hell for the next three hours, at least that's what we've noticed. Peter has returned with the basket. The Punks look at the baby, their eyes wide with disbelief. PUNK #1 What the hell is that?   A baby? PETER  No, it's a very short teenager. Of course it's a baby! Now listen carefully: I'm giving you a can of the milk she's been getting. She loves it, and more importantly,"
michael,"You bet that's the plan! We're not keeping her one more second. PUNK #1 Okay, if that's the plan... He passes the basket to Punk #2 PUNK #1 ... Here, hold this. Okay, so long! They start to leave, pressing the elevator button."
peter," Oh shit, I don't have it on me... But I'll call you. Okay, so long! PETER & MICHAEL So long! The elevator has arrived.    The Punks quickly slip inside it with the basket. Michael closes the door. Peter plops down in the armchair by the front door. PETER Aah, relief at last!    Good riddance! MICHAEL You said it! Now maybe I can get some work done. He disappears in the direction of his room. Peter is sitting    on something hard. He pulls it out from under him, it's    a package. He looks at it, casually reading: ""Care     of Jack Collins."" He tosses it to the side. Suddenly,     it dawns on him. He leaps up, grabs the package and    runs into Michael's room."
michael,"But did the cops see the dope? PETER No, it's right here.  He takes out the package. MICHAEL Shit! PETER We'll get twenty years if the cops find this on us! Climb down the fire escape and hide it... anywhere! Michael takes the package, opens the window and starts to climb out it when Peter stops him. PETER Hey, whatever you do,   don't lose the goddamn dope, we   gotta be able to return it to   those dealers or we're dead. Those    guys are serious. MICHAEL Don't worry. He starts down the fire escape, then stops and turns back. MICHAEL Oh, by the way, I put some water up to boil for her bottle. Michael disappears. Peter picks up Mary, grabs his  wal- let and leaves the room. When he gets to the hall,  he discovers that Cop #1 has joined Cop #2, to whom he is whispering something. Peter holds his license out  for them to see. PETER Here's my license. COP #1 I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to remain in the apartment. The narcotics squad will be arriving any moment now. They want to ask you a few questions. PETER Narcotics squad? What do they want with me? I don't even use aspirin! "
michael,"Did you change her? PETER No, she's soaking wet."
michael,"Okay, I'll do it. Michael puts down his bag of groceries, takes Mary from Peter and disappears with the box of diapers. In his room, he lays Mary down on his bed and starts undressing her."
michael,"Okey-dokey, honeybunch, it's time to go beddy-bye now... We're gonna take a nice long nappy-wappy..."
peter," Sure.   This is Jack Collins. AGENT #1 Oh yeah?   Now that's interesting. Michael has laid Mary down for a nap in her basket, observed by the five cops. He now sits down, cheerful and bubbling over with enthusiasm. MICHAEL So! Can I get you something to drink? Agent #1 totally ignores him. AGENT #1 So, who's the baby belong to? PETER It's Jack's daughter. AGENT #1 And why are you two taking care of her? PETER Because her mother's in Europe for six months, and since Jack had to be away for two weeks, I took my vacation to take care of her, I love kids. MICHAEL Yeah, Peter and I just love kids! AGENT #1 Now that's interesting. Well, we'll be seeing each other again soon, in fact very soon. In the"
michael,"Come back anytime, gentlemen. You're always welcome here. We have no particular plans to leave New York in the near future, so don't worry about us now. 'Bye now. Once the cops are gone, Michael races back to the living room. Peter has collapsed into his armchair."
peter, I diapered the dope on her right in front of the cop and he never noticed a thing! PETER I told the cops we were taking care of her. You realize we're now stuck with the kid till Jack
peter,"You're going now? MICHAEL Yeah, but don't worry about it, I'll be back before it's time for her next bottle. She's asleep now. PETER Terrific, just terrific! Jerry just called: I have to go to the office right now. MICHAEL Well, call him back. Tell him you'll come later. PETER There's no way. I can't, he's suicidal. Why don't you call Oxman and tell him you'll be there in a few hours. MICHAEL You're crazy. Oxman is leaving in an hour. If I don't meet him before then, I blow my 15,000 dollar contract. PETER Oh shit, I can't take this anymore! MICHAEL Look, maybe we could pawn her off on Mrs. Razzolini, just for a couple of hours -- she's crazy about her! PETER Good idea!    Let's go."
michael,Wait -- I hear someone... I'll go see... Peter waits with the basket.   Michael tiptoes to the corner of the corridor.
peter,"Bullshit, it's a trick. MICHAEL You think so?    Really?"
peter,"They just said that to put us off guard. They saw the condition this apartment's in. PETER  They know the punks were here looking for the dope and that they probably didn't find it. So that means we've still got it. MICHAEL But he said the investigation was closed. PETER Okay, let's just see how closed it is. I'll go downstairs. You watch out the window and see if I'm being tailed."
peter,We'll have to be very careful.
punk,"Hi! Doin' a little shopping, huh? How's your place -- not too much damage, I hope. MICHAEL What do you guys want? PUNK We want the dope. Tomorrow. MICHAEL And we want to give it to you. But the cops are tailing us nonstop. Matter of fact, there's one right behind us now... PUNK That's your problem, man. Figure out a way to shake 'em. Either we safely get the dope tomorrow, or you, your friend and the kid'll get this.  We'll call you tonight. He runs off, disappearing into the darkness. From the slit-open grocery bag milk flows out onto the sidewalk. Michael is shaking all over. Standing about twenty yards away, Graton hasn't missed a thing."
graton,"... My snitch told me the gang hasn't gotten the dope back yet, but they will soon. They made contact with the two guys tonight ... No, no, they don't know I'm tailing them. These jerks are going to fall right into my hands..."
michael,"All right, Jack. Why don't we start at the very beginning. The very day you left for your vacation... JACK Hey, will you please stop talking like Mr. Rogers? It's getting on my nerves. PETER  His nerves! Ha. Ha. Ha. His nerves! Michael, his nerves! You wanna talk about nerves! Then just shut up and listen. It so happens we don't want a kid here either, but when someone dumps one on us, we take goddamn care of it. MICHAEL Yeah, we take goddam care of it. PETER We haven't had a decent night's sleep in two weeks. Michael's probably going to lose a $15,000 contract... MICHAEL Peter couldn't leave. Jerry almost jumped out the window. It's lucky they even made it to the finals! JACK What? PETER First, we've got the    narcs on our ass, then there's the    drug gang threatening to carve    us up. Then bottles... bottles...    every three hours, bottles. MICHAEL And diapers. Have you ever tried to do diapers?"
peter,"'La Paz, Bolivia...' He calls from ... 'I'm onto something hot.' He says. 'Did the package get there?' He says. You asshole!"
michael,"And the day they wrecked the apartment, Peter came home and couldn't find Mary. I've never seen him in tears like that bef... PETER  Never mind about that. Look, Jack, you got us into this mess, and you're going to help us get out of it. JACK What are you guys talking about? What narcs? What gang? And who's that fucking baby? PETER For your information, the 'fucking' baby's name is Mary. And if I were you, I'd watch what I said about her... because she just so happens to be your daughter! JACK What?? MICHAEL And it just so happens, we've got a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a baby's ass, even if she's yours! Peter and Michael exit, slamming the door."
peter,"What's the problem? GRATON You guys must think you're pretty smart, don't ya?  Holy shit! The diaper! Graton starts running like crazy back to the fountain. He rummages like a sick dog all around the spot where Michael had been lying. Suddenly he dashes toward the trash can and dumps out its contents, throwing the garbage around like a lunatic."
graton,"The goddam diaper! What a jerk, what a goddam schmuck I am! Peter, Michael, Jack and the 10 plainclothes detectives watch Graton going bananas. MICHAEL  I think that guy needs a vacation. JACK He should try South America. PETER Yeah, I hear it's nice there this time of year."
michael,"Sylvia -- She wanted to know how Mary was doing. JACK What? Jesus Christ, Michael, why didn't you let me talk to her!? MICHAEL She would have just hung up on you again. The important thing is she knows Mary's fine. JACK You jerk! You should've said she was terrible, sick as hell! Practically on death's door!  What's with him? The kid's doing really great!"
jack,"... Yeah... A little girl, Mary... SCREAMING coming over the phone. JACK ... I'd love you to see her. In fact, I was gonna bring her down tomorrow... today?... Great, I think there's a flight in three hours. I'll be at your place by two. See you real soon! He hangs up gleefully, rubbing his hands together."
jack,"Really, by hand? MICHAEL  I gotta get going, I'll miss my plane..."
michael,I am! PETER How 'bout Jack?
michael,"On his way to Miami. PETER Oh, yeah. He's got a lot of nerve! Leaving us with the kid again... MICHAEL No, he took Mary to his mother's, she couldn't wait to see her. He's gonna try to unload her on her till Sylvia gets back. I made her four bott... PETER  Of course not! What, are you crazy? I'm relieved! Thank God she's out of here! MICHAEL I made her four bott... PETER"
michael," Four bottles for the goddam trip. There, I finally got it out."
peter," What do you want? JACK Nothing, nothing. PETER Don't go into my room, she's asleep. JACK Yeah, but the nanny, Mrs. Bretsaws, she wants to see her."
peter,"No, damn it, no! You're gonna wake her up! It already took me an hour to sing her to sleep... JACK Yeah, but she wants to see her. PETER All right, I'll go explain the situation. JACK  Wanna bet she's out of here in ten minutes slamming the door behind her? They tiptoe over to the living room door and eavesdrop."
peter,"Oh, yeah?   How do you figure that? MRS. BRETSAWS Shouldn't I be discussing all this with the father? PETER Well, listen, Mrs. Fretsaw, umm... Brainsore... MRS. BRETSAWS Bretsaws, Mrs. Bretsaws. PETER Right... Bratsnot, lemme tell you something. With a child you always know who the mother is, but the father -- that's another kettle of fish. So don't give me that bullshit, okay? MRS. BRETSAWS Very well. I won't discuss it any further with you. Will you please show me where the kitchen and the bathroom are? PETER What for? MRS. BRETSAWS So I can make you a list of the things we need. PETER What do you mean, make you a list? -- Don't you do the shopping yourself? MRS. BRETSAWS No shopping or laundry or housekeeping. I am a professional nanny. PETER We have plenty of everything. MRS. BRETSAWS Do you have a sufficient amount of fruit and vegetables for the child? PETER She only eats milk and cereal."
peter,"Oh that's bullshit. You don't feed a baby like an adult. MRS. BRETSAWS  I knew you'd say something like that, you jerk! MRS.    BRETSAWS Fine. Anything you     say, sir. Let me just remind    you that I have my diploma and that    medicine is a serious matter. PETER Do you know the song that goes 'Medicine's a whore and the pharmacist is her pimp'? MRS. BRETSAWS No, I don't. We must listen to different music. Personally I'm very fond of opera."
peter,"Mrs. Breakballs, if you don't get out of here right this minute I'm gonna punch you in the nose! This is my home, now get out!"
peter,"Not a    chance! I'm not doing the night    shift. I absolutely refuse. I have    too much work to catch up on for    the competition. JACK Well, needless to say I refuse, too!"
michael,"Listen to me, you selfish bastards! My shift is eight hours in a row. No way I'm gonna do nights too. After 6 P.M. she can scream all she wants, I don't give a shit. PETER You know, Jack, you're a real slime ball! We give you the easiest shift: the morning. She's always in great shape in the morning, isn't she? We've got to work like crazy to save our jobs and you have the nerve to refuse nights. Goddamit, she's your daughter. Are you that horny? JACK  Hey, horny yourself! I don't give a shit. I don't need you guys. I'll find some other way to do it. And I won't take the New York-Washington shuttle! He exits, furious."
jack," Oh, hi... Nah, nothing's wrong. PAUL What were you doing in the boss's office? JACK I was asking to do the New York- Washington shuttle for a few months. PAUL Oh, and he said 'no,' huh?"
jack," As a matter of fact, he said 'yes.' Paul backs up against the wall, protecting his face with his arms. Jack leaves, disgusted. Paul watches him go, totally confused."
michael,"Coochie, coochie, coo... woo, woo, woo... bippity, boppity boo... Peter comes rushing into the apartment and runs toward his room. He stops short in the corridor -- he hears Mary's laughter and Michael's coochie-coo's. Noiselessly he tiptoes over to the living room door and listens, troubled. Then he walks away and shouts, as though he were just coming out of his room. PETER Hi, Michael, I just came back to get a file I forgot..."
peter," Okay, that's it. Into the kitchen. He exits, furious. Peter and Jack follow after him. Fuming, they file one after the other down the corridor past the stunned Brunette in her T-shirt who was waiting"
michael,"I'm not a punching bag!   You assholes! JACK If I can't bring a girl back here anymore, just say so. And I'm gone. I'm outta here. With Mary. PETER You can bring whoever you want as long as they speak softly like everyone else! MICHAEL One thing I know: I can't goddamn wait till Sylvia gets back! PETER Yeah, you can say that again! JACK And again, and again, and again... Meanwhile, the Brunette has put her clothes back on and gathered up her belongings. Now she enters the kitchen. BRUNETTE Sorry to disturb you guys, but I'm splitting. I didn't come here to be a bedwarmer. 'Bye. JACK "
jay's wife,"So what's it made of? In the b.g., the BABY starts CRYING again. PETER Umm, it's made with whipped cream and loads of nipples on top -- I mean, loads of... raspberries ... I'll be right back..."
jack,That's not fair -- let's take Mary out there... MICHAEL And the hell with it.
jack," Who's her mother, anyway? PETER She's in Europe, she'll be back in a few days. CARL Does she always cry like that? MICHAEL No, it's only because she's teething, she's usually very sweet... The guests remain silent. CAROLINE"
jerry,"What if you just put her back to bed? NATALIE Right -- she's just throwing a temper tantrum, put her to bed... PETER We already tried..."
jack,"It's her teeth... NATALIE  Oh, nothing, nothing -- I was just trying to liven up the"
carl," You motherfucker, get out of here! Get out of my house right now or I'll kick the shit out"
jack,"Stop it, Peter. Give her to me, I'll put her to bed... PETER  Hey, Caroline, I think we should"
jerry's wife,"Well, the atmosphere wasn't exactly festive... JERRY Sorry about the cake, Mike... It looks great! MICHAEL Oh, never mind, don't worry... Good night... Jerry and his Wife exit. Michael is left standing there with his cake. Jack comes in, full of beans. JACK Well, she's asleep at last! We sang in har... Hey, where is everybody? MICHAEL Gone. Can you make a little room for me on the table to put the... JACK You mean they're all gone? MICHAEL Yeah, all of 'em, hey, can you make a little room for me to... JACK  Peter! Peter, goddamit, get out here! Peter comes back in with Jack. JACK They're all gone!"
peter,"Who gives a shit, they're all jerks anyway. MICHAEL Hey, could you make a little room for me on the table so I can... JACK It's because of the kid.     They can't stand kids. PETER I can't stand kids either but that's not a reason to leave! Dipshits, they're all a bunch of dipshits, every one of 'em. MICHAEL Oh, fuck it -- I'm sitting down. He sits down on a chair with the cake on his lap. JACK And did    you hear Natalie: 'She's throwing    a temper tantrum, just put her    to bed.' What a pain-in- the-ass    that broad is! PETER  Hey, you're the pain-in-the-ass! First you dump a baby on us, then you scare everyone away from the party, then... JACK I scared    everyone aw... Just cut the    crap, will you? My whole life is    diapers, shuttles and bottles.     I do the graveyard shift, I'm the    one who never gets any sleep.     I... PETER Listen, we all have two full-time jobs! That's for sure! MICHAEL And what about me? I'm a prisoner in this house all day long, forget about chasing ass, I haven't gotten laid in six months. When the hell is your friggin' Sylvia gonna come back? "
jack,"She's been gone for six months and four days. PETER If she's not back by the end of next week, I'm kicking her kid out! MICHAEL You better give your goddam Sylvia hell for this! JACK Don't worry, she's gonna get it but good! PETER And you can tell her we have a lot better things to do with our lives than wipe a baby's ass, goddamn it! He exits. So does Jack. Michael is buried under the three-tiered cake, unable to see around it. MICHAEL Do you guys want some cake?  Guys?"
peter," Fine, fine, she's doing great... She's getting her back teeth in lately, it's been a bit rough... SYLVIA Can I see her?"
peter,"Oh, yeah, sure, she's in there... They both enter the living room. Mary stares at Sylvia. When she spots Mary, Sylvia suddenly breaks down in tears. Peter is dumbfounded. SYLVIA I don't believe how much she's grown! Recovering, wiping away her tears, she walks over to the playpen. SYLVIA Hello, Mary, hello my darling... She picks her up, hugs her tightly, showers kisses on her. MARY LAUGHS. Sylvia starts crying again. SYLVIA How beautiful she is... Her hair has grown... Look how much she changed, I missed it all. I missed her so much! Peter, in a kind of daze, stares at Sylvia. Without looking at Peter, she dries her eyes and tries to stop crying. SYLVIA I wanted to make life difficult for Jack but I never thought I'd miss her so much... PETER  Oh, yeah... make life difficult for Jack..."
sylvia,Is he here? PETER What?
sylvia,"Is Jack here? PETER  Oh, yeah, yeah, I'll go get him... He exits like a sleepwalker and goes straight into Michael's room. The latter is asleep."
sylvia," Do you want me to take her? PETER No, I have to burp her first. With dexterity, he places Mary face down on his shoulder and walks around in the kitchen, patting her on the back."
jack," Yeah, sure... Michael bustles about. Sylvia's gaze comes to rest on the crib which stands imposingly in the middle of the living room. Music boxes, little booties and stuffed animals are hanging from the bars, and a pretty white tulle frames the crib."
michael,You'll have to come back and get the crib later. SYLVIA Yeah...
sylvia,"Yeah, I bet... Actually, that was kind of the point... But I'm the one who really got screwed... She starts to cry again."
jack,"Don't cry, c'mon... you're taking her back now, it's great... SYLVIA  Okay, well, thanks again -- 'Bye! PETER, MICHAEL AND JACK"
peter,"Oh shit -- I forgot to explain about the cereal! JACK She'll figure it out by herself... MICHAEL Yeah, she'll manage... JACK Now it's back to the good life for us! MICHAEL Sleeping late! Different women every night! I can't wait! JACK Forget about the New York-Washington shuttle! I'm off to Caracas! PETER And I'm gonna be able to get back to work, so Carl better watch it -- I'm gonna slaughter that son-of-a-bitch! First with this goddam competition... and then with Natalie. MICHAEL And I've got six months' worth of sex to catch up on with Cathy, Nora, Frances, Susan, Barbra... They have entered the elevator. The doors close. They come out of the elevator, in front of their apartment. MICHAEL ...Christie, Paula, Sheila, Lisa, Kimberly, Rhonda, Rebecca, Louisa..."
michael,They won!    They won! BLONDE Who won? MICHAEL Peter.     He won the competition! BLONDE Great!     Who's Peter?
graton,"Hi... JACK  Oh yeah, I see... JACK So, shall we go for a walk?"
jack,"And you know what, it's not even like they wanted us to believe it -- it might have been us who wanted to believe it... But let's face it, nobody comes out of our rib... GRATON  But wait -- the baby's gone..."
michael, It doesn't knock me out at all... MICHAEL Is there any jam left? PETER Do. Silence. PETER You eatig here todight? JACK
jack,"Sylvia doing okay? YOUNG MAN I don't know -- I'm a med student. I'm just babysitting. I only met her a couple hours ago. JACK Oh, I see... Silence. The Young Man sits down at the table and immerses himself in his books. Mary doesn't look up from her pack of cigarettes anymore. JACK Listen, on second thought, I don't think I'll wait for her. Just give her this when she gets back, okay? And this is for the baby. Jack hands the bouquet and the rabbit to the Young Man, who plops them down on a chair. YOUNG MAN Sure, no problem. He immerses himself again in his books. Jack heads toward the door, then turns around. JACK Shouldn't the baby be in bed by now? YOUNG MAN Yeah... I don't know... When I put her to bed she cries so I just let her stay up... JACK Don't you have any tights to put on her legs? YOUNG MAN Tights?... Well, it's pretty hot in here anyway..."
jack,"No, I'm not going anywhere anymore, I've had it with traveling. I quit. MICHAEL C'mon, I'll call you a cab, you've still got time. JACK Don't you call anybody. MICHAEL But the plane's s'posed to take off in half an hour -- They won't have time to replace you. This is serious -- you'll lose your job and you won't be able to pay your share of the apartment anymore... you... Jack takes off his pilot's jacket and throws it aside. JACK I'll be a dishwasher, I'll live in a flophouse. MICHAEL What the hell happened? JACK I'm not going, I told you; I'm not going ever again. I'm sick and tired of traveling, sick and tired of broads. They all have the same asses and I can't seem to love them anyway. I can't take another hotel room, and swimming pools and trendy restaurants! I want to know"
michael," Jack!   Jack, c'mere for Chrissake! SYLVIA 'Cause my place is tiny, y'know, and my schedule's insane -- and I just finished four days of posing and we ended up every day at..."
sylvia,"Oh, so the flowers and the rabbit were from you... JACK I could have strangled that guy... SYLVIA I mean it, I can't cope anymore. My parents and I don't talk to each other and anyway they live in Texas, and the baby needs to get out to the park... MICHAEL Yeah, tell me about it! Finding time to take her to the park every day is a real bitch! SYLVIA And I have to work, I need the money to survive and anyway I love my job... A distraught Peter, bare-chested and in jeans, comes running in from his room. SYLVIA But to work I've gotta have a babysitter, and to have a babysitter I need to work, so I run around all day...  It's just 'cause I haven't slept in four nights -- she must be teething or something, I don't know but I can't manage... PETER Don't worry, it's nothing, she's"
michael,"But you're beautiful -- At your age all you need is a good night's sleep and you'll look like new. SYLVIA Right, a good night's sleep -- but when? PETER Well, why don't you leave the baby with us for a few days, till you recuperate... I mean, if you want. MICHAEL We're old pros -- it's not a big deal for us... SYLVIA  Really? I can leave her with you for a little while? JACK Of course. Leave her with us. Come back whenever you want. Get some rest. Sylvia, between two sobs, picks up a big bag beside her on the doorstep. SYLVIA I brought a couple of things for her, just for a few days... Michael eagerly takes the bag from her.    It's followed by a second, and then a third. PETER"
jack,"She'll need two or three months to recover, at least... Maybe more! PETER We could set up a room for her here... MICHAEL A room for her and a room for Mary... JACK Then we could have four shifts instead of three!"
peter,"Yeah, but I don't think she'll agree. She's got her own life to live. MICHAEL Yeah, she probably wouldn't want to move here. She'd think we'd jump on her any chance we could... JACK But we'd make a rule, she'd just be 'one of the guys!' MICHAEL She'll never want to... SYLVIA  Deal. Mary    suddenly comes in from the kitchen, walking unstead- ily    but determinedly. She's dragging Graton's rabbit by its    ear. She looks at the four of them and laughs her head    off. FREEZE FRAME."
