ken castle, Slayers.
ken castle,"Gina, when was the last time you saw someone volunteer to be murdered? I'm sure you know that every last one of our Slayers is a bona fide death row inmate -  ...each one offered a chance to participate as an alternative to their sentence. Stay alive for thirty sessions and get set free... that's not a bad God damned deal."

ken castle,I'd remind your audience that Slayers was put together with the full cooperation and approval of the United States federal government... that the revenue it produces is responsible for funding our entire prison system - keeping the bad guys behind bars... and that the prop was voted for by a cock solid 68% of the American public.
producer, What'd he say?
ken castle,There's a lot of men and women in prison that could never cut it as slayers... shouldn't they have the same opportunity to roll the dice for a ticket out? Besides - they only need to survive one session.
