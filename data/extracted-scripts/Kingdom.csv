Speaker,Dialogue
kevin fleury,This is my Fredricksburg house and my grandma Ruth playing with my skateboard ramp. It's a Tony Hawk jump ramp.
mick,I forgot what I was going to say.
kevin fleury,This is me at my second birthday party with my mom and my dad. That's my cake.
mick,Where's your gun?
little boy,"Yeah, where is your gun?"
fleury,"I'm assuming that there are no bad guys in this room. Isn't that right? I mean, are you guys good guys or bad guys?"
fleury,Right. So why would I have brought my gun to a room full of good guys?
miss ross,What's that picture?
kevin fleury,This is me and my dad playing Battleship at my dad's apartment.
mick,What is a battleship?
kevin fleury, My parents are divorced.
miss ross,"So, who's that in that picture up on top?"
kevin fleury,"That's my fish, his name is Jaws and he's a really mean fish."
kevin fleury,"My mommy is a Think Tank worker and she is really, really smart. She went to two colleges and has three computers."
kevin fleury,This is the day that my daddy says is the happiest day of his life.
miss ross,"Really. His happiest day! Can you tell us about that day, Mr. Fleury?"
ronald fleury,"I sure can. That was December 4th and that was the day that we spent the whole day in the hospital waiting for this guy right here to come out of Kevin's mom's tummy. And we waited and waited but he wouldn't come and we kept waiting and finally the doctor said `OK...he's not gonna come out on his own so we got to go get him.' And well,"
miss ross,Go for it.
miss ross,Then what happened?
lu lu,What did they do?
ronald fleury,"They started to pull and pull and pull... they had something in there and it started coming and they were pulling and the doctor all of the sudden said ""STOP!"""
driver,"How are you today, Sergeant?"
haytham,Sun is shining. Wind is blowing. How bad can I be doing?
driver,"I like that, ""Sun is shining..."""
white man,GET DIRTY!
pitcher,STEP IT UP NOW!  Ready for my knuckle-curve?
teammates,TAG UP! WAIT `TIL SHE CATCHES IT-
pitcher, -COMIN' HOME!
grandfather,Don't stop watching the game.
driver,You have a copy of the duty rost-
sergeant haytham,LOCK DOWN!
watching officer, COME TO ME! FOLLOW ME!
ronald fleury, Fran?
ronald fleury,"Hey, I'm at Kevin's school. What's goin' on?"
ronald fleury,Where exactly?
ronald fleury,How?
kevin fleury,Dad?
ronald fleury,When?
ronald fleury,"Fran, I'm rollin' right now. Let me call you back: I gotta ring bells"
ronald fleury,"Son, I gotta go to work."
kevin fleury,We're gonna do ceramics...
ronald fleury,I gotta go to work...
kevin fleury, Who was that?
ronald fleury,Big Fran -- you remember him?
kevin fleury, Uncle Fran? Put peanuts in his Coke so he could drink and eat all at the same time?
ronald fleury," Where he's from in South Carolina that's called fine-dining, Bud."
kevin fleury,What happened?
ronald fleury, Something bad.
kevin, `Lotta bad people out there...'
ronald fleury, I love you.
kevin fleury,You gonna go see him?
ronald fleury,I'm gonna try...
miss ross,Where's your husband going?
lyla fleury,"Ex-husband, and God knows."
francis manner,"Rex, how old were you when your hat was that small?"
rex burr,"You gotta stand, Big Man."
francis manner,"We need to get everyone back, then get all their-"
glenda,It was... I don't know what time it was... the dishwasher's broken...I was waiting for the dishwasher... The doorbell rang - I thought it was... it wasn't the dishwasher guy...It wasn't. It wasn't.
fleury,"Glenda, I want you to look at me."
cnn reporter,"...1 hour ago: blasts in Saudi Arabia, in or around the `Al- Rahmah' western housing complex near Riyadh. More than 100 feared dead, including children. The Saudi Foreign Minister has released a statement calling this a `heinous act possibly committed by foreigners...'"
bbc reporter,"...homes to thousands of Westerners and other non-Saudis who work in the Kingdom, there have been several attacks on these compounds in the last five years. As such, they have become very tight in terms of security, with both the Saudi National Guard and police taking command."
ronald fleury,"Numbers so far: 100+ dead, 200+ injured. The target was a softball game. Rumor is the Killers wore Saudi police uniforms.  Special Agent Fran Manner was killed."
grant sykes,"From the craters, looks like they used a High Explosive... possibly military grade: can't fit that much TNT into a vest. 20, 30 pounds of PETN: they got it. Semtex or C-4: they could get it. The third there, God knows...that crater looks like a plane dropped a 500-pounder..."
ronald fleury,Obviously a secondary blast after the initial devices used to lure first responders to the scene. Don't know anything about where or what it was yet.
grant sykes,This is how they do it.
ronald fleury,"If you already know the answer Adam, why ask the question?"
sykes,"We're not seeing this kind of planning and execution anywhere else...these ain't hot-wired artillery shells waiting for Humvees to roll by.  These hits are coordinated: planning, timing, and big, broad- daylight balls-"
janet mayes," Yeah, So... did they all happen during daylight?"
janet mayes,We had two others...North of Riyadh and the oil thing. What was that?
adam leavitt,The Refinery... Ras Tenura Refinery.
janet mayes,"Yeah, south of Jeddah. Same thing: daylight, suicide bombers. Right? "
adam leavitt,Yup.
ronald fleury,This is not new in concept. It is new in scope. It's bigger. Very sophisticated. Command and control was flawless. They found the largest kill zone they could and they did it... they did it by being patient.
adam leavitt,Any rumors or confirmations of uniforms being used in the other two attacks?
grant sykes,"That's `worst case scenario' if you're still asking for my stab, Sir. A crew who can build bombs this big, with this level of eyes- on control and detonation coordination... has access to Saudi uniforms now...I mean...Baby Jesus."
leavitt,Anyone take credit?
fleury,"Abu Hamza. Saudi Al-Qaeda. Bin- Laden-wanna-be. We know he was in Afghanistan, then moved to Iraq. Now he seems to have come home. He's clearly becoming increasingly active..."
adam leavitt,"If it is Hamza, he's definitely turning up the volume over there. "
janet mayes,"They can't afford to appear as if they are losing any kind of control. They lose control over their country, their people...then they risk losing control over the oil. They won't let us in. No way."
ronald fleury,"From the State Department, one hour ago: `We are in agreement with the Saudi security assessment that any additional American presence on Kingdom soil represents reckless risk. Therefore it is the Secretary of State's position that only after the situation has been evaluated and contained, should the Federal Bureau of Investigation activate Rapid Deployment.'  I'm going to get us access. Keep your go bags hot. It's gonna come fast."
adam leavitt, How's he gonna do that?
sergeant haytham,Killing those I saw responsible.
sergeant haytham, I don't understand.
sergeant haytham,-that is not a crime-
sergeant haytham,It's not.
sergeant haytham,I do not.
sergeant haytham,I am not my brother.
sergeant haytham,I am NOT my brother!
sergeant haytham,Uniforms?
sergeant haytham,I sweat. I'll say it again because it is true. I need more uniforms because I must change during shifts...look at my shirts.
sergeant haytham,-then look at my jackets. Please. Permanent stains...no matter how many times they're cleaned...
haytham,I love my country.
haytham,I love my country...
director grace,"Everyone's terrified, so nothing moves. Paralysis. You and your team aren't going anywhere.  And this meeting is just a circle- jerk, Ronnie: Attorney General Young's going to go through the motions because protocol says we get an appeal. We'll be on record, but expect nothing more."
ronald fleury," Yeah, sure. No problem."
director grace, What about Agent Mayes?
ronald fleury,Ask her.
director grace, What about you?
janet mayes,I'll be fine.
director grace,I apologize if we're late-
gideon young,They were early.
director grace,You know Special Agent Fleury?
gideon young,I do.
director grace,"This is agent Janet Mayes, she's one of our Arabic experts."
gideon young,OK. The latest.
ronald fleury,Two suicide bombers. Rumors they were dressed as Saudi Police. We believe this is the work of Saudi terrorist named Abu Hamza.
gideon young,Go on.
ronald fleury,"A Shooter crew served as distraction. After the initial attack there was a lull to allow Saudi Emergency Teams...and our own attaches...to collect. Then a secondary blast was triggered, aimed at those first responders. So they targeted families and rescuers with one attack.  I think that's a clear signal that their definition of `Enemy' is expanding."
maricella canavesio,My God.
gideon young,"Let us never forget how cheap life is over there. Now...I have seven minutes before my next meeting, so who's talking first?  You two digested the memo?"
ellis leach,"I'll go first if that's okay Maricella?  First, I'm sorry about Fran Manner."
director grace,As we are about Rex Burr.
ellis leach,"I met with Prince Thamer at the Saudi embassy fifteen minutes after I heard this morning's news. After speaking with Thamer, I advised we withhold additional US personnel because a big part of the religious justification for these bombs is the presence of current US personnel. More boots on Saudi soil make an already combustible situation more so. I know that's not the answer you want, but..."
maricella canavesio,"My two cents: The Saudis haven't asked for FBI help. Sounds like they've done just the opposite. If we force the issue, that could further anger an utterly important ally that shares a 1000-mile long border with Iraq."
gideon young, It's all rock-solid logic.
director grace, We would just like to be on record as saying we think we should go ASAP-
gideon young,That's not going to happen
ronald fleury,"Sir, how would you imagine it looks viewed through an FBI agents eyes?"
gideon young,Pardon me?
ronald fleury,I'm interested in how you think this situation is viewed through our eyes.
gideon young,"It's some variation on vengeance... When one of your own is killed, Agents lose their analytical powers - kind of a greatest strength, greatest weakness thing..."
ronald fleury,"If I wanted vengeance, I'd have whispered `Rex Burr' into Ellis's ear right when we walked in. "
maricella canavesio,What's the distinction?
ronald fleury,"To call this massacre an act of terrorism... that implies a specific political agenda. To me, these killings are so futile and unbalanced that they feel utterly sociopathic- more like Charles Manson than Osama Bin Laden..."
janet mayes," Al Qaeda lost the first phase of this war, so a new, zero-sum phase has begun: if you won't join us, we'll let loose the truly talented Murderers... Abu Hamza. He will kill so many of you that the resulting humiliation of the Saudi Royal Family will cause an exodus, a rebellion, both. Because the Royal Family simply cannot protect you or yours any longer."
ronald fleury,"When she says talented, she's not talking about the walking-bombs who can sneak past any and all security, nor the hi-jackers tough enough to take an airliner. We're talking about the Man who teaches them how..."
janet mayes,"--the operational commander who organizes, trains, plans, encourages. That is who we're fighting."
ronald fleury,"If we don't get inside Saudi Arabia within 36 hours, there is no chance we catch the killer responsible for Al-Rahmah. None."
ellis leach,Okay. I believe it all. So doesn't your team in that country represent the kind of target one of these `Masters' would die for? Trade ten of their own for one of you?
ronald fleury,To not engage these criminals out of fear for our personal safety is just another way of saying `uncle.'
gideon young, That was spirited... let's all thank God Special Agent Fleury doesn't make policy decisions. He'd turn the FBI into Patton's Third Army.
director grace," I see the look in your eyes. That look is trouble: old school, play ground shit, vengeance..."
ronald fleury,It's not vengeance.
director grace,"It ain't justice. It's stronger. We've all been there. I have. Vengeance is always dirty, Ronnie."
ronald fleury,I just can't sit this out. I can't watch this not get dealt with. Not again.  Know what my high school football coach used to say to me?
director grace,What?
ronald fleury,"""HIT SOMETHING."" All night long, Coach Bailey would scream ""HIT SOMETHING."" Every play."
director grace,That's good coaching.
ronald fleury,"I'm fixing to go hit something, boss. You with me?"
director grace,How you gonna do it?
ronald fleury,The Saudis covet good PR as much as their Oil: 15 of 19 hijackers on 9- 11 means most Americans will never stop asking if that Saudi Oil is worth it. It's all about press.
director grace,"Few more moves and it's Total War, Ronnie. The only time Treason is palatable is when it's done righteously and completely..."
janet mayes,"Oh, I'm in...Not a question. I'm definitely going."
ronald fleury,What's your take?
elaine flowers,"Looks like every overthrow in history: once the guys with the guns are no longer trustworthy, the government's days are numbered."
ronald fleury,White House call you with a spin?
elaine flowers,"You kidding? We don't talk since I broke the Vice President's guy cooking dirty intel on Iran. They hate me. What's up, Fleury?"
ronald fleury,How hard you gonna hit the Royal Family in your column tomorrow?
elaine flowers,With a sledgehammer.
ronald fleury,With the bombings? Or other things...
elaine flowers,"What's ""other"" than the bombings?"
ronald fleury,I know you're tracking Al Haramain.
elaine flowers,Is that what you want to talk about? Saudi officials making donations that end up... What? Blowing up trains in Paris? Buses in London?
ronald fleury,Sometimes. Seems that just might happen. 
elaine flowers,Murder...Hookers...Houston? Can I take some notes?
ronald fleury,I'm not saying that.
elaine flowers,Are you saying anything?
ronald fleury,I need a favor.
elaine flowers,"I don't do favors, Ronnie."
ronald fleury,When it's real and it will be real... I'll come to you with what we have first. It's yours. Exclusive.
elaine flowers,OK.
ronald fleury,You call Thamer at the Embassy. Tell him that the FBI is getting real close to laying out some major Saudi VIP indictments relating to newly uncovered charity financing out of a Boston investment firm. We're gonna freeze a lot of Saudi cash and roll out some major embarrassment.
elaine flowers,Can I mention Houston?
ronald fleury,"It's a free world, baby. Ask him to comment."
elaine flowers,He won't.
ronald fleury,Tell him that I'm running the investigation.
elaine flowers,OK.
ronald fleury,Tell him that I'm not the nicest kid on the block.
elaine flowers,That would be accurate.
ronald fleury,I want fifteen minutes with him tonight.
elaine flowers,Wow. OK. And I get what?
ronald fleury,I come to you first. No one else.
elaine flowers,"What's really going on here, Ronnie? You going strong over Fran Manner?"
ronald fleury,"I'm just trying to do my job, Elaine. That's it. Call Thamer."
elaine flowers,I'll see what I can do.
ronald fleury,Get back in.
ronald fleury,"Too many people we both know were at the bar. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Highness."
prince thamer,I had an interesting conversation with a reporter from the Post.
ronald fleury,"She can be a bit of an exaggerator... I'm sure things were somewhat over-stated. I see myself as friend of Saudi Arabia. I just need a little cooperation, that's all."
prince thamer,What kind of cooperation??
ronald fleury,"Full cooperation: my Team cleared to land at Prince Sultan Air Base. Tomorrow. We want to help in a very muscular way, quickly."
prince thamer,Next month would be as soon as...
ronald fleury,"This goes one of two ways. First: The FBI with the White House go on the kind of aggressive PR ""Saudi Royal Family Decaying Monarchy"" bender that just can't help but hurt. Really hurt. And I don't care how many Chinese are lined up to buy the oil. You know it's gonna hurt."
prince thamer,My family is not decaying-
ronald fleury,"And then we bring the hammer down hard as hell: Bust Al Haramain - we got direct links from Riyadh - two wives donating ten million to three Arab-American cultural centers in Boston. Then what gets kind of not- funny is how some of that cash found its way to Jakarta and some Mosques that have these training camps built right next to them. It's kinda funny... you got little kids playing over here, and some not so little kids playing with guns over here. That's kinda odd."
prince thamer,You have no proof of this.
ronald fleury,"We're getting there, Sir. And I haven't even brought up the two girls still missing out of Houston. This is big. It is real. And I know you only care so much about public American opinion, Sir. But the story will be covered... Big..."
prince thamer,What is your point?
ronald fleury,"Last I heard, 112 people lost their lives in your country. One of them was a good friend of mine. I want in and I want in immediately."
prince thamer,"Define ""immediately."""
ronald fleury,Right now immediately.
fleury,"If your phone doesn't work international, you can borrow mine."
prince thamer, We cannot allow 100 agents-
prince thamer,-even 25 more armed Americans could spark rebellion-
ronald fleury,That's too bad.
prince thamer,Saudi Security. That's non negotiable. You cannot bring guns into the Kingdom.
ronald fleury,Men in Saudi Police uniforms are why we're talking now.
prince thamer,They would be hand picked.
ronald fleury,Whose hands?
prince thamer,Mine.
fleury,If anything happens to me or my team... It's on you. Understood?
prince thamer,"Cool it with the John Wayne, Mr. Fleury."
ronald fleury,-seven-day or work-week?
prince thamer,Work week. Five days. No guns.
haytham's father,What happened?
sergeant haytham,You haven't heard about the attack?
haytham's father,I choose not to listen anymore. What happened to your face?
sergeant haytham, An attack today.
haytham's father,Look at me.
adam leavitt, What was Fran Manner to her?
grant sykes,"He taught her how to shoot, she taught him most everything else.  Celebrated graduation at the IHOP in-town until some Townie called Janet something...Something not very nice. Townie didn't see Fran coming outta the Head. But he definitely felt Fran's uppercut shatter his jaw."
adam leavitt,Fran didn't get bounced for that?
grant sykes,SAC Fleury took care of him.
adam leavitt,How?
grant sykes,If I knew how I'd be SAC Sykes. I do know the post in Riyadh was part of the deal Fleury cut to save Fran's career.
adam leavitt, What did SAC Fleury whisper in your ear this morning?
janet mayes, `Grant's age is a liability.'
adam leavitt,What can four people do in five days? Really?
grant sykes,Aren't you the one who demanded to go this morning?
adam leavitt,"I meant the FBI. I didn't mean ""me."""
grant sykes,Mars.
janet mayes,"I'll be looked at with what I can only describe as disdain, pretty much the entire time we're on the ground... kind of like South Virginia."
grant sykes,Go easy on my kin.
janet mayes,"It's a very confused culture. Extremely religious. Had nothing; wanted nothing. Sixty years ago, they hit oil. Simple religious men become trillionaires... a schizophrenic nation is born. The royal family, who we back, and everyone else."
grant sykes,What's going on in there?
ronald fleury, I'm good.
grant sykes,"Feels like you got a beast in there, Fleury."
ronald fleury, I'm good
grant sykes,"""Good"" is 6:00 am Sunday morning when your kid climbs into your bed, buries himself into you... sun's creeping through the windows - soft. Birds and wind-chimes... that's ""good."""
ronald fleury,I'm OK...You don't think I'm OK?
grant sykes," I think you're not entirely clear right now. That's OK, but you got to know that. You want to go - we go. I got you, but you got to check yourself."
ronald fleury,I'm checked.
grant sykes,OK. I'm just checking that you checked.
ronald fleury,How we doing?
ronald fleury,They gonna let us land?
ronald fleury,Good.
ronald fleury,Hunting...
ronald fleury,Big Game hunting.
ronald fleury,Heads on a swivel.
ronald fleury,Special Agent Ronald Fleury.
janet mayes,We brought our own.
adam leavitt,Israeli stamp in my passport?
grant sykes,And I usually just toss it on the kitchen table...
janet mayes, Wouldn't need the power a' prayer if there were 2 hands on the wheel.
adam leaviit,"110 miles per hour... How do you keep so calm? I mean, really? Is it breathing--"
janet mayes,--Shhhh....
ronald fleury,If somebody was tailing us it'd be obvious. This is just standard operating speed.
ronald fleury,You don't know what you missed... you should have seen him play for our Chicago Bulls.
grant sykes,You have portable lights on-scene?
grant sykes,We only have seven days: we work around the clock.
grant sykes,We're safe during the day?
adam leavitt, I don't like camels.
grant sykes,You interviewed witnesses?
grant sykes,Were any of the uniformed bombers brother-officers?
ronald fleury,"You don't know the source of the blast, don't know if your own Officers were involved, but you won't let us work nights?"
director grace,"Good afternoon, Sir."
gideon young,`Sunlight is indeed the most powerful disinfectant. 
director grace,"Senators? Then I'd change `outmoded' to `outdated,' `echelons' to `ranks' and what in God's name is `contretemps?' These guys aren't the best and brightest-"
gideon young,-never take the Lord's name in vain in this office-
director grace,-but you can say `Fucking?'
gideon young,-you really want to bet?
director grace,I do.
janet mayes,That's one of the great horrors of television: Crime scene manipulation. They say a TV camera adds pounds to actresses. Isn't that what they say?
adam leavitt,"Who's ""they?"""
janet mayes,That is what they say. Doesn't add to crime scenes. Television cameras shrink them. Misrepresent. No smells. Poor sound. Limited view. TV always makes them look smaller. You can't feel the hatred on television.
fleury,"...heads on a swivel, people."
janet mayes,EASY.
fleury,What time tomorrow morning?
ronald fleury,What time is sunrise?
grant sykes,That's against fire code.
janet mayes,"They don't have fire codes. They don't have codes other than codes of war. They'll lock us in and dial up some kind of earth movers if they want to. You know that, Sykes. Dig a big hole and push us in. Fill it up and no one comes calling. You're in the jungle now, baby."
adam leavitt," You alright, girl?"
janet mayes,"Watch it, boy."
adam leavitt,Just asking...
janet mayes,Unpack.
fleury, Saudi slow roll...
lyla fleury, Hello?
ronald fleury,Hey... How are you? How's my boy?
lyla fleury,We're just fine. How are you? Where are you?
ronald fleury,I'm here...  Lemme talk to my boy.
fleury,What you doing?
fleury,I'm missing you.
fleury,I'm in Saudi Arabia.
fleury,Yeah... I saw him...  I saw him.
fleury,Yeah... Yeah...he's still tall.
fleury,"Yeah, buddy. I love you. Keep your eye on your mama. Be the man."
fleury,I'll call you tomorrow. I love you.
schmidt, You are in so much trouble.
fleury,Is that right?
schmidt,"For sure. I mean, I don't know how you did it. Nice work, but if you live through this, which I put at about fifty percent - if you do, your balls are gonna get stretched and beaten on. Dig that?"
schmidt,Nice pictures. You guys ready to go home now?
grant sykes,Slow roll... gonna be like when you go deep sea fishing in Florida and you pay seven hundred bucks for the boat and you sit in the ocean for hours and the crew jumps around and screams and points and you think your constantly about to bag a Marlin but you never do and they keep pointing and jumping and-
fleury,Enough.
police officer,You're willing to die to protect your enemy?
ronald fleury,What did the Prince say?
ronald fleury,What rules?
ronald fleury,That's not accurate--
adam leavitt, How could they get more secure?
sykes,"Well, this is going well..."
fleury,Saudi Slow Roll.
janet mayes,Good.
leavitt,How do you do that?
janet mayes,Check.
leavitt,Don't say `good' again.
janet,Bueno.
fleury, Of course we won't.
fleury,I would have thought your primary concern was investigating a crime.
sykes," Is it one of those kind of deals, Colonel?"
fleury,"So, if you're not running the investigation...who is?"
adam leavitt,I thought the SANG were soldiers--
ronald fleury,Who is in charge of the investigation then?
ronald fleury,To walk through? Are you kidding me?
ronald fleury,Get him over here now and let's clarify this situation.
ronald fleury,"There sure as hell is! I don't know what kind of game you're playing but you got the wrong guy, Colonel Al-Ghazi! That was not the deal-"
ronald fleury,OK.
fleury,"I'm guessing there are a bunch of Americans, Brits... Australians? Someone must have seen something. I'm sure they're just dying to talk to you guys, seeing as how the killers were wearing your uniforms. That must be a real confidence booster for them."
earl,There's still a couple of hundred of us living on the compound.
ronald fleury,Why Saudi Arabia?
earl,"Neither of us did anymore schooling than Electra High, Electra Texas."
ronald fleury,OK.
earl,And the jobs here pay twice what you'd make in Midland or the Gulf a' Mexico. Plus the house is free.
janine ripon,I call it combat pay. This place has gone Guns - Guns - Guns.
ronald fleury,So has Everyone else now.
janine,My girlfriends in Texas spend their combat pay on diamonds... I spent mine on a safe room.
ronald fleury, Two nights back. Can you start one second before you knew anything was wrong?
janine,We didn't really see anything. Just hit the ground and hustled to the safe room. Closed our eyes and prayed. It was so fast. So loud.
ronald fleury,So you really didn't see anything.
maddy,I hit the deck. Horrible.
janine,Not `til after. Just the screams--
earl,-- the kids... they were screaming. That got me out of the house. Those kids.
fleury,Which kids were those?
janine,The Jackson kids. Tracy Jackson next door was murdered looking out her window...front of her children. No safe room over there...  Not even the Men that did this should die in front a' their babies.
ronald fleury,She live with her husband?
earl,Aaron.
ronald fleury," If I'm facing your house, is the Jackson home to the right or left?"
janine,Left.
ronald fleury,Mr. Aaron Jackson?
aaron jackson, Get him away from me-
ronald fleury,"-easy, Sir. He's a friend to us-"
aaron jackson,-I don't know either one a' you.
ronald fleury,I'm Special Agent Ronald Fleury of the FBI. This is Colonel Al-Ghazi with the Saudi State Police-
aaron jackson,-the Police: they attacked.
ronald fleury,Can I come back?
aaron jackson, WHY?
ronald fleury,Your boys...
aaron jackson,When my wife's jaw was shot off in front of our sons? My sons who sat with her while she bled to death? Couldn't speak because she didn't have the bottom of her face and I wasn't home and my baby boys are destroyed for life and my five year- old had a box of band-aids in his hand when I finally got home?
ronald fleury,...I won't pretend to know...
aaron jackson,"Kill everyone that had something to do with this. Everyone related to them. Everyone who knew them.  And all you'd be doing is their recruiting for them... It's an entire generation: not small and isolated like they say. But a generation that thinks what they did to my wife, to my children, is a ""calling""..."
ronald fleury,"Up the street, there was a wreck, did you see any-"
aaron jackson,-notice how it wouldn't take a lot to disguise your friend  as a Mexican? Think he couldn't handle crossing our deserts? Look around!
ronald fleury,Aaron-
aaron jackson, -LET ME FINISH GOD DAMN YOU-
ronald fleury, Can we tour the compound? Can we please do that?  Slow nod from Al-Ghazi.
janet mayes,He or she almost made it.
fleury,That's what makes this a War.
adam leavitt,Hit a water main?
grant sykes," Hole is the case. See, there's ""evidence"" down in that hole. You understand evidence? Little things that are ""clues."" Clues can be very helpful to a fella when he's trying to solve a crime."
grant sykes,Glad to hear it. So can we get in there?
grant sykes,OK.
adam leavitt, A little high...
fleury, Watt-tee...
adam leavitt,Watt-tee fuck  is his gun doing up so high?
adam leavitt, Are the Shooters in-custody-
sergeant haytham,-dead.
fleury,Were any of these shooters your men?
sergeant haytham,No.
fleury,They got into the compound. Somehow...took control of this vehicle. I'm guessing they didn't politely ask whoever was in this car if they could take it for a little ride?
fleury,I understand that. Those men were your men--
sergeant haytham,-- they were. They were Police.
fleury,I'm sorry.
janet mayes,"Good news is that if he shoots you, he's gonna shoot you sitting on an American tank... with an American- made bullet. So, it's kind of ""all in the family."""
adam leavitt,How about we get into those American Suburbans... with their American A/C...  Al-Ghazi continues the tour as Fleury once again notes the familiar apartment off in the distance.
fleury,The car was parked here?
fleury,Backed in?
fleury,They were attacked from the front. Must have assumed the killers were fellow officers... Have any of these men been identified?
janet mayes,"The same Mosque is enough to identify them, link them to a cell?"
adam leavitt,Suweidi?
janet mayes,Suweidi is a known militant stonghold. Al-Qaeda could recruit from storefronts.
fleury,Can we go to check out some of these surrounding buildings?
fleury,"Seems reasonable that the Planner had to observe and based on Hamza's past history, it's consistent that he would want to video the attack. Is that true? Is that accurate?"
ronald fleury,"Well, in order to video, in order to observe, you need a view."
fleury,That building sees all three crime scenes.
adam leavitt,"-c'mon now. This is insane: we got enough security to invade Suweidi, let alone that building-"
fleury,-time. I understand.
janet mayes,"This is the kind of radical circumstance that could have seriously upped Shaq's free throw percentages. Take a man. Ship him off to Riyadh. No phones, constant threat of death, no girls, no hip hop. Nothing... just free throws. Shaq, he'd be shooting at least seventy percent. Lakers would still be together. Kobe and Shaq lovers forever."
sang officer,This is unacceptable.
janet mayes,Tell me it didn't burst-tell me it didn't burst-
fleury,I see.
ronald fleury, Two big answers in two small minutes. Imagine if we had a couple days together.
ronald fleury,And I imagine that will run until sundown?
fleury,You want to tell her that?
adam leavitt,Big wall.
adam leavitt,How many Princes are there?
ronald fleury,They all get palaces this big?
adam leavitt,Who pays for all this?
grant sykes,"General Motors, Ford, Chevrolet..."
adam leavitt,"Hey, man - I drive a Hybrid."
adam leavitt, What's a Raptor?
adam leavitt,Super.
ronald fleury,I do.
ronald fleury,I've seen that the man who planned the worst crime in your Kingdom's history is without a doubt Saudi...
grant sykes,That was impressive.
ronald fleury,Think it will work?
grant sykes,"Yeah. Maybe. I mean, you can only play the ""I'm going to the press card"" like three more times. So, maybe."
ronald fleury,They're paranoid and overly self- protective.
damon schmidt,"They aren't protecting anyone. There's no conspiracy. They're just terrified. Finally. The Saudis have finally seen the Monsters they helped create, because those Monsters have come home. And if Saudis don't catch Saudi Monsters, that's the end."
grant sykes,"That's dead on accurate. Very impressive. That's why they're making it hard on us, and that's why he wants to help `em turn the screws."
ronald fleury,They can have every shred of credit-
damon schmidt,-you see the slums on the way in?
ronald fleury,Yeah.
damon schmidt,"See that even though their homes are falling down, they had satellite dishes bolted on?"
ronald fleury,Yeah...
damon schmidt,"Everyone already knows you're here. Credit? If the Saudis cracked this Cell while these servants were pouring coffee, Al-Jazeera still leads the story with your Team."
ronald fleury,Have you been to the crime-scene?
damon schmidt,No-
ronald fleury,"-if you had, you'd see the evil work of real Talent. The kind that doesn't stop until it's forced."
damon schmidt,And the path to Hell is paved with good intentions.
ronald fleury,You having fun?
ronald fleury,By catching Abu Hamza.
damon schmidt,"Then here's to you. Let's bet: when this Colonel Al-Ghazi comes out, he's in-charge of the investigation -if so, you set me up on a date with Janet Mayes."
ronald fleury, Do me a   favor and tell Janet that she and   Damon Schmidt got a date when he   gets back to the States.
ronald fleury,We should start with the dead shooters.
ronald fleury,Can we photograph all three of them? Couple hundred copies each...
ronald fleury,"Good. If it's OK with you, I'd like to suggest we split up as follows..."
grant sykes," Got to get a little dirty, people. Crawl up in it. Make deep contact. You get that?"
ronald fleury,Have him pass these out to the compound security. See if anybody knows them.
ronald fleury,Would you mind doing one more thing for me?
earl,"No, Sir."
ronald fleury,Could you tell me if you recognize any of these men?
janine,...Horrible.
earl,I don't know any of them.
fleury,I'm just wondering. That chair out side. Looks like it gets a lot of wear. Looks comfortable.
earl,That my mom's chair.
fleury,"See, that's exactly what I was thinking. I'm guessing she spends a lot of time sitting outside?"
earl,All day.
fleury,She must pretty much see it all. Right?
earl,She does.
fleury,Where is she?
earl,She's sleeping.
fleury,Let's wake her up.
maddy,I've seen him.
ronald fleury,Where?
maddy,"Like, a week ago. Twice I've seen him. Watering...With the garden crews. I remember he was wearing a Liza Minnelli T-shirt. I thought that was funny."
ronald fleury,What about the others?
maddy, No. Just him. I remember the T- shirt. I remember thinking it was odd...?
ronald fleury,"What, the Liza Minelli shirt?"
maddy,"No. I do think Liza Minelli's gone odd, but that wasn't it."
ronald fleury,What was odd?
maddy,He was a Saudi. The gardener.
ronald fleury,Yeah.
maddy,"Saudis, like Americans, don't do manual labor. Blowing leaves is beneath them."
ronald fleury, Thank you.
earl,Who is he?
ronald fleury,That's one of the many things we're trying to find out...
ronald fleury, How are your Sons?
aaron jackson,-what do you know about what my kids need? What they saw? What the rest of their lives might be like?
ronald fleury, I thought maybe your Boys...without their Mom anymore...might ask you why sometime...
aaron jackson, Tomorrow it'll be somebody else's wife.
ronald fleury,Then tomorrow I'll come back.
ronald fleury,We know where he lives?
ronald fleury,You don't seem very excited.
ronald fleury,Where?
sykes,It's a gurney.
grant sykes,Here.
haytham,You cannot touch any Muslims.
janet,No problem. Can I still touch Americans?
haytham,Of course.
fleury,"What's gas running a gallon out here, Al-Ghazi? Penny gallon?"
ronald fleury,A trillion reasons for our Leaders to hold hands another one hundred years.
ronald fleury,Agreed.
ronald fleury,"Yes, I do."
fleury, Feel like I'm back home in Detroit.
ronald fleury, OK. Shouldn't we arrest him or shoot him or something?
ronald fleury,This place is community service?
ronald fleury,Why did he turn himself in?
ronald fleury, How does he know he slept soundly?
ronald fleury, Is that why you quit?
ronald fleury," Well, I think I get the `prayer' and `luck' parts..."
grant sykes,"Whatever this is, it blasted-off like NASA."
sergeant haytham,Driven in at an angle... go deeper...
grant sykes,`High-order explosion' doesn't do it justice: what's left a' this looks like it was put through a wood-chipper.
sergeant haytham, Hospital Identification... Ambulance identification.
grant sykes,Do you know this hospital?
sergeant haytham,Yes.
grant sykes,Call it in.
ronald fleury,OK.
ronald fleury, What you got?
ronald fleury,Why?
ronald fleury,Where's Muaath?  COLONEL AL-GHAZI I'm going to show you.
grant sykes,We never get to do anything fun.
janet mayes,"Sykes, I'm guessing you don't even remember how to load your gun."
grant sykes,That's not funny.
adam leavitt,She's not trying to be funny.
grant sykes,I'm a very good shot.
janet mayes,I'm sure.
grant sykes,Prints are on the other side...
ronald fleury,JANET...
janet mayes, Yeah... I pulled so much it's hard to remember it all.
ronald fleury,Bolts?
janet mayes,Yes.
ronald fleury,Wing nuts?
janet mayes,Yeah.
ronald fleury,Razor blades?
janet mayes,Sure.
ronald fleury, ADAM...
adam leavitt, The Coalition...
janet mayes,-the Prince's Convoy just showed.
ronald fleury,This is bullshit. You know it. Meaningless. There's no leader here. These are kids. That's it.
janet mayes,We're out of here.
ronald fleury,"Yes, that's it. Smile for the cameras, body-bag some children. Wrap it up, but us -- out. I get it."
ronald fleury,You need water?
adam leavitt,You really ought not look at this.
damon schmidt, That fella got shot right through his God damn nipple...
janet mayes,Don't stare too long. It'll start living in your dreams.
damon schmidt,No -- I know.
ronald fleury,You do?  How did you know we were here?
damon schmidt,The Prince has Men at Al-Rahmah.
damon schmidt,"Ask him.  3 vehicles will stay behind when the Prince and Press leave. You'll convoy straight to BA flights into Dulles -- last minute fares come out of your budget, by-the-by. Tried to swing upgrades, but check at the counter."
ronald fleury,-Ellis Leach?
damon schmidt,You know him? He's gonna be put out to pasture: made an example of by the President to ensure all levels of government get tough on Terror.  You won the hand on the River card.
ronald fleury,"We didn't win shit, Schmidt. These are teenagers... children with pictures that someone far senior has provided them."
damon schmidt,"-kidding me? You mean those are Terrorist targets? Holy Wow. Momma, don't let your children grow up to be cowboys.  Just get ready to go home and revel in the fact that for the next few weeks your shit won't stink."
ronald fleury,Hello? 
ronald fleury, What do you think?
ronald fleury,Yeah.
grant sykes,"I'm thinking about going straight to Dan's, gonna order six PBRs-"
janet mayes,-Pabst?
adam leavitt,"Keep it real. You ever drink PBR, Haytham?"
haytham,No.
grant sykes,Any beer?
haytham, No.
grant sykes,Now...that's just unreasonable. Good Police work and problem drinking are like a chicken and egg thing: which enables the other?
ronald fleury, Remember how we caught that cell?
ronald fleury,"Four hundred dollars. For four hundred dollars, he was caught. Stupidity. Catching the cell was easy. Just like this. The cell came back."
grant sykes,I'm serious. Beer will open up your subconscious. Canned beer especially. Give you instincts they can't teach-
ronald fleury, Is he responding to the call? Dropped back...
ronald fleury,You whole?
adam leavitt,Think so-
ronald fleury,WHAT THE-
janet mayes, ADAM! WHAT -- WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
ronald fleury,GUN!
grant sykes,-DOOR HELP-
ronald fleury,Hands up -- you're gonna fall-
sergeant haytham,They're going to disappear...
ronald fleury, GET DOWN!
sykes,Nobody's gonna hurt Leavitt but me.
the son, DO NOT COME HERE!
mercedes driver, He's been shot! BE READY.
passport officer,NOW. HURRY.
ronald fleury,BRAKES-REVERSE-TO THE RIGHT...
grant sykes,-GET OUT OF-
fleury,MOB FORMING NEXT BLOCK!
driver,READY?
ronald fleury,RPG!
sykes,THIRTY EIGHT RAZOR MAD DOG!!!
janet mayes,ADAM?!
janet mayes, Sykes is going to kick your ass.
ronald fleury,Everybody OK?
fleury,There's at least three more of them.
janet mayes,It's okay Little One.
nassar,You are a traitor to your country... a traitor to your God.
ronald fleury,...Don't...
aunt,Will you tell me what Grandfather whispered to you before they took him?
grandson,"""Don't worry: we'll kill them all."""
kevin fleury,You stop the people that hurt Uncle Fran?
