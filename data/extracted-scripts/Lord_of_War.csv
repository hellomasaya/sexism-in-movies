Speaker,Dialogue
yuri,There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation.  That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet.  The only question is...  ...how do we arm the other eleven?
ukrainian officer," Call it ""agricultural machinery""."
yuri, All property is theft.
yuri, Shortages?  What shortages?
radio announcer, And that concludes this edition of news from the BBC World Service.
anatoly, Trading Jews for grain.
vitaly, It's good P.R. - for the Moscow Olympics.
irina, Good for the Jews.
yuri,And us.
vitaly, We're not Jewish.
yuri, We're Jewish if we say we're Jewish.
anatoly,Mazeltov.
anatoly," How many times--I can't eat shellfish.  It's ""treyf""."
irina,You're not Jewish.
anatoly,I like it.  I like the hat - to remind us there's something above us.  I like that.
irina,You're not going to temple.  You go to temple more than the rabbi!
baptiste, --World order?  You say we jeopardize world order?
baptiste, I am only going to the restroom.
yuri, Orders.
baptiste, This is what they mean by U.N. Observer?
baptiste, Aren't you going to help me hold my cock?
yuri, Doesn't look like a job for two men.
baptiste,"You know you are fighting a losing battle, my young friend.  War is nature.  If you take away the guns, we will kill each other with knives.  Take away the knives, we will kill each other with sticks.  Take away the sticks, we will kill each other with your peace treaties.  You cannot stop this bath of blood."
yuri,"It's not ""bath of blood"".  It's, ""blood bath""."
baptiste,Thank you.  But I like it my way.
ava, Baby blue.  My favorite color!
ava," I don't know if you'll be taking me to bed tonight, darling, but you can take her."
manager,Don't touch what you can't afford.
monrovian girl, What's this?
yuri, For the smile.
yuri, President Lincoln.
yuri,What?
liberian man,President Jackson.
yuri,No.
liberian man, You are driving a hard bargain.
yuri," No, keep it.  Keep the money.  Keep the gun."
liberian man, What do you take me for - a thief?
liberian man,Demand and supply.  There is more I am thinking where this comes from.
yuri, You want more Glocks?
liberian man,And the Heckler & Koch G-3 assault rifle.
yuri,What makes you think I'll do that?
liberian man," By the way, do you have the hollow point cartridges?"
yuri, You got any color preference for that?
liberian man, I will find you.
vivian," What are we doing here, Yuri?"
yuri, Whatever you want.
vivian,"You know what I mean.  Here, in this country.  Are we doing any good?"
yuri, Would nothing be better?
irina, Who are you?  You're not my son.  My son doesn't own such a suit.
yuri,You know who's going to inherit the earth?
vitaly, It's a hell of a fucking career move.
yuri,That's the point.  I've seen how the world's coming apart.
vitaly,And you want to help with that?
yuri,"You can't stop it.  It's a basic human need - we eat, sleep, sleep with each other and what else?  Fight. The oldest human skeletons have spearheads in their rib cages."
vitaly,What do you know about guns?
yuri," Every day there are people shooting at each other.  I think to myself, what guns are they using?  Why not mine?"
vitaly, I don't know.
yuri," Vitaly, I've tasted your borscht, you're no fucking chef.  I can eat here for free and I still don't eat here.  You're doing nothing with your life."
vitaly,"Maybe doing nothing's better than doing this.  Yuri, I've actually fired one of these things."
yuri,That's why I need you.  Brothers in arms.
anatoly," Finally getting in touch with what's important, my Son?"
yuri, Yes.
asian businessman, --I can get you the shoulder-fired SA-7 surface-to-air missiles.  The older Chinese model.  Not so effective against modern military aircraft but deadly if used against a commercial airliner.  I'm giving them away at eight-fifty.
yuri,"That's him.  The guy Eli told me about.  Simeon Zaharoff.  Brokered deals in the Iran/Iraq war - both sides, sold missiles to Argentina in the Falklands.  Hets a fucking legend.  I've got to talk to him."
yuri,Simeon!  Simeon!
vitaly, They're talking.
simeon,May I help you?
yuri,"A mutual friend, Eli Kurtzman from Brighton Beach Import-Export said to contact you.  I have a business proposal.  Perhaps we can discuss it - over a drink."
simeon,You're in the wrong place my young friend. This is no place for amateurs.
yuri,I sell by the kilo.
yuri," This is bullshit money, Vit - small fucking potatoes."
vitaly,"What do we do, go more legitimate?"
yuri,No.  More illegal.
vitaly,What I'd give right now for a plate of red cabbage and potatoes.
yuri, It's not our fight.
yuri,How's it going?
indian commander, We're making terrific progress - most casualties from avalanches and frostbite.
yuri, Make sure you thaw out the guns before you fight.
yuri," Cannibal, what's going on?"
cannibal,"Cease fire, man.  Cease fire.  It's over."
yuri,What?!  What do you mean it's over?
cannibal,"Truce.  We're friends, man."
yuri," Friends?!  You can't be fucking friends. Last week I spoke to you on the phone.  You said you would not rest until every last rebel was dead.  You called them vermin. You said would piss in their mouths, you said you would exterminate them like cockroaches.  Just last week, you said this!"
cannibal," That was last week, man."
yuri,"Cannibal, don't you fucking walk away from me!"
cannibal,"Peace, man!"
yuri,"Fuck you, Cannibal!!"
vitaly, Maybe we can offload it - the Balkans.
yuri," At least when they say they're going to have a war, they keep their word."
afghani official,"I hope you're not thinking of selling these, Mr. Orlov."
yuri, Personal use.
afghani official,There's a hundred thousand bullets here.
yuri,I'm kind of trigger happy.
yuri, The Angel King will arrive tomorrow...Hallelujah to you too.
captain,Do we run?
vitaly,We have to get out of here.
yuri,"No, no-one's going anywhere.  Slow--dead slow.  Buy me time."
yuri,What?!
vitaly,I've got Belgium.
yuri,What the fuck use is that?!  He's painting a name registered in the fucking Netherlands!
vitaly," Yes, why?"
yuri,Turn it on its side.
valentine,"Not exactly ""The Love Boat""."
yuri, It's Yuri.  Phone in a sighting of the Kristol south of Aruba.
agent," Sir, sighting of the Kristol due north."
yuri,Nice job.
yuri," Hey, pay before you play."
narc leader, You're late.
vitaly,"Hey, fuck you!"
narc leader, Fuck you!
yuri," No, you don't fuck him--"
narc leader, I apologize for earlier.
yuri, I understand.
narc leader,It's all there.
yuri,What is this?
narc leader,Six keys of pure.
yuri, I can't hand this to my fucking bank teller at Chase Manhattan.
narc leader," Have you checked the street price today? With the seizures at the border last week, it's jumped thirty percent."
yuri,I sell guns.  I don't sell drugs.
narc leader, Diversify.
yuri, I've got standards.
vitaly, Now what?
yuri, Vit.
vitaly," It's my brother, Yuri.  He's my big brother."
yuri,What the fuck is that?
vitaly,"Ukraine.  I start in Odessa, work my way to the Crimea--"
yuri, --You'll be fucking dead before you reach Kiev.
vitaly,You fuck!
yuri,Get out of the car.
vitaly, Please.
yuri,"Vitaly, you're going to have a good time. This is a top place.  Two Ford models checked in last week and that cute weather girl's been here since July."
vitaly,Please.
vitaly, You're a good brother.
agent, --There's really no one else you'd consider? Christie and Brooke are both available...not the right look?  It's just that Ava doesn't generally do print.
yuri, The beer.
ava," Popular hotel, huh?"
yuri,Yuri Orlov.  What brings you to St. Barts?
ava,"A photo shoot.  At least, that was the plan. But the photographer's plane got stuck in Miami.  Hurricane - though there was nothing in the news."
yuri, Those things can come out of nowhere.
ava,The job's cancelled and there's no flight back to New York 'til Tuesday.
yuri,You can hitch a ride with me if you like.
ava, This is your plane?
yuri, That is my name.
yuri, I had no idea.
ava,Don't apologize.  I put on clothes for a living.
yuri, At least you aren't taking them off.
ava, What about you?
yuri,Nothing so glamorous.  I'm in transport - international air freight mostly.
ava,"What, like UPS or something?"
yuri,Something like that.
ava, Business is good.
yuri,"Like you, I can't complain."
ava,But if you did?
yuri,Well...I don't know.  It's just that I travel all around the world but I can't help feeling sometimes that I'm going nowhere.
ava,"This is no accident, is it, Yuri?"
yuri, I don't believe in fate.
ava,What do you believe in?
yuri, It's traditional.
vitaly, Traditional.
anatoly," Always remember, son, there's something above you."
yuri," Sure, Dad.  A forty-thousand dollar crystal chandelier."
irina,You need this.
anatoly, Jesus was Jewish.  You're worshipping a Jew.
irina,"Ava, this is too much."
ava,Yuri likes to spoil you.
ava,Nicki!  You did it.  Good boy!
anatoly,That's my grandson.
ava, Yuri.  Don't you want to see what your son is doing?
anatoly,What the hell's the matter?
yuri,It's over!  It's over!
ava,What's over?
yuri,"The Cold War, the Soviet Union, the Evil Empire.  Mikhail's saying ""no mas"".  He's throwing in the towel.  It's over."
ava,That's nice.  Your son is crawling.
anatoly, At least there'll be religious freedom.
yuri,I think I'll go back for a visit.  Do you stay in touch with Uncle Dmitri?
anatoly, Dmitri Volkoff?  Now and then.
yuri,How is he?
anatoly,"The luckiest man alive.  You know he was one of the first men at Chernobyl.  Off-duty, at his daughter's wedding, he was roaring drunk.  He was the only one who survived. Later they found that alcohol in your blood resists radiation."
yuri,He's still a General in the army?
anatoly,Major General.  He got promoted.  Two of his rivals were also there that day.  I told you - he's the luckiest man alive.
yuri,He may be luckier than you think.
anatoly, Is this how you want to be remembered?
yuri, You're only remembered when you're dead.
anatoly,It's not kosher.
vitaly,Merry fucking Christmas!
anatoly," Vitaly, who is this?"
angel,Angel.
vitaly,Her name really is Angel.  She's a fairy.  Let's stick her on top of the Christmas tree.
yuri,I'm going back to Ukraine.
vitaly, I miss Odessa.  I miss you.
yuri,I miss you too.
border guard, Visa?
yuri,It's good to be home.
dmitri,"Nephew, come here and hug the luckiest man alive."
dmitri, This is the SLK?
dmitri,"I can't just sell you government property, Yuri.  I have to report--"
yuri,--Report to who?  Moscow?  As of last week Moscow is in a foreign country.
dmitri," New flag, new boss."
yuri,There is no new boss yet.  They're too busy squabbling over who gets the presidential holiday home at the Black Sea.
yuri,How many Kalashnikovs do you have?
yuri," Is that a ""4""?  It doesn't look like a ""4"" to me.  It looks more like a ""1""."
dmitri," No, it's a ""4""."
yuri,It's whatever we say it is because no one else knows the difference.
dmitri,"Someone will work this out, Yuri.  What happens then?"
yuri," We'll cut them in.  Anyway, what could happen - you're the luckiest man alive."
yuri,He's a friend of mine.
simeon,Do you know who the fuck I am?
officer, Who the fuck cares who the fuck you are?
simeon,I demand to see your commanding officer.
officer,You don't demand shit.
simeon,Just give me back my papers.
officer, What papers?
barmaid, You sell guns?
yuri,Maybe you'd like to come to my room and see my bazooka.
yuri,"You look a little lost, Simeon.  Is the world changing too fast?"
simeon,"I am here, aren't I?"
yuri,"Not all of you, I think."
simeon,"I can't deny, it takes some getting used to. Last week we were trying to beat their brains in and now we're going into business together."
yuri,"There's no place in gunrunning for politics anymore, Simeon.  I sell to leftists, rightists.  I'd sell to pacifists but they're not the most regular of customers."
simeon,"I understand you have Ukraine in your pocket but there are the other satellite states. Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Belarus.  Instead of cutting each other's throats, it may be more profitable to work together.  What do you think?"
yuri,I think you are the amateur now.  I think you suffer from a philosophical disadvantage - you have a philosophy.  I think you should go with your instincts - your first instinct.
simeon,The problem with gunrunners going to war is there's no shortage of ammunition.
ukraine major," --I'll tell you what I'll do.  Buy six, you get one free."
yuri,What about tech support?
ukraine major,No problem.
yuri,"Son, get off there before you get hurt."
ukraine major, He's the tech support.
yuri, He's twelve.
ukraine major,Thirteen.  Almost fourteen.
dmitri, Kids grow up fast around here.
ukraine major, He can take it apart in his sleep.
dmitri,"How can I?  You keep selling my helicopters. You're too greedy, Yuri."
yuri, We have to go back.
dmitri,We'll be going in reverse.  We can't turn around for a mile.
young soldier,They're coming.
dmitri,We shoot it out?
yuri," And start an international fucking incident - no, no, no."
dmitri,So we run.
yuri,No.  I've got paperwork.
dmitri," Not for the gunship.  Yuri, you know the penalty for sanction-busting - selling a military helicopter?"
yuri,It's not a military helicopter.  It's a rescue helicopter.
yuri,Yuri Orlov.
valentine, Papers.
yuri, The crew called that vessel a lot of names - none of them repeatable in polite company.
valentine,The end-user certificate for this aircraft states Burkina Faso.  Nice.  Did you type it yourself?
yuri,It's for humanitarian missions.
valentine,You're a humanitarian?
yuri,Not any more.
dmitri, Listen to the nephew.
yuri,Didn't you get the memo?  The war's over. What can they do with military hardware but convert to civilian use?
dmitri,"What, yes?"
yuri, The only way you could die from this baby is if a food drop hits you.
valentine, Also going to Burkina Faso?
yuri, But to a different client at a different address.
valentine,What do you take me for?  A complete fucking fool?
yuri," Not complete, Sir.  And while I hesitate to tell you your job, I must point out that when shipped separately the weapons and the aircraft both comply with the current Interpol trade standards and practices."
valentine, You expect me to believe this is a coincidence?
yuri,I can see how certain people might interpret it as suspicious but thank God we live in a world where suspicion alone does not constitute a crime.
valentine, Yuri Orlov.  You and I are going to be seeing a lot of each other.
yuri,I can hardly wait.
valentine, Watch out for the time you don't see me.
boy, What an asshole.
yuri, What was he doing here?
dmitri, Trying to beat your offer.  I sent him on his way.  He doesn't understand the concept of loyalty.
yuri,Don't worry.  There're more VCR's.  I left them in your new car.
dmitri,Even your enemy was admiring that car.  I am the luckiest man alive.
yuri, Dmit--!!!
ava," Yes, I'll accept the charges."
yuri,Ava--
ava,"Hey, baby.  You forgotten what time it is?"
yuri,"Sorry.  I, er...  How was your audition?"
ava, They're going in another direction.  The direction of someone who can act.
yuri,Don't say that.  You're good.
ava,And you're biased.
ava, Where are you?  Is everything okay?
yuri,Rough day at the office.
ava,Come home.  We miss you.
yuri,Soon.  How's Nicki?
ava,Asleep in our bed.  It's lonely without you.
yuri,A party.
ava,It's always a party where you are.
yuri,I'd better go.  I just wanted to call--hear your voice.  Kiss Nicki for me.
ava,I love you.
yuri,Thank him but I have other business.  A busy schedule.
yuri,What do you know?  My schedule just freed up.
yuri,"Part One, Two or Three?"
yuri, The M60.  You want the attachable grenade launcher?
gloria,"Hello, Mr. Yuri."
faith,We'd be happy to make you happy.
gloria,"Don't worry, we don't have anything."
yuri,How do you know?
faith,Do we look like it?
yuri, What if I have AIDS?  Don't you worry?
gloria,You worry too much.
faith, Why worry about something that can kill you in ten years when there are so many things that can kill you today?
gloria,How can we make you happy?
yuri,By leaving.
yuri," --that's the Beretta, comes with a 36 cartridge, easy-operating clip--"
baptiste,What did you say?
yuri, It's a used gun.  I can't sell a used gun.
baptiste,A used gun.  That's a good one.
baptiste,"I can't pay your asking price, Yuri.  We are not a rich people and the market is already flooded with your Kalashnikovs.  In some places you can buy one for the price of a chicken."
yuri,"You can't just look at the unit price.  You forget the ancillary costs.  End user certificates need to be forged and notarized, shell companies set up, insurance purchased, pilots and crews hired.  Not to mention the bribes.  You can't get a nut and bolt out of the Eastern bloc without a bribe.  There's one bribe for the nut. Another for the bolt.  This is an expensive proposition."
baptiste,I pay in timber...or stones.
yuri, I'll take the stones.  It's hard to get a tree trunk in my hand luggage.
baptiste," Very professional, Lieutenant."
lieutenant, Dismissed!
yuri,I know you're planning a new offensive.  If you delay a week I can get you the armored personnel carriers we talked about.  They would give you a significant strategic advantage.
baptiste,They say I am the lord of war.  But perhaps it is you.
yuri," It's not ""lord of war"".  It's ""warlord""."
baptiste,I like it my way.
ava,"Yuri, I just got off the phone with the dealer.  I sold my first painting."
yuri, Fantastic.  Who bought it?
ava,Someone important.  They want to remain anonymous.  How was your trip?
yuri,"You know.  Same old, same old.  Where's Nicki, in bed?"
ava,I'm sorry.  Poor darling.  He tried to stay up.
yuri,I'll kiss him goodnight.
vitaly, This calls for a drink.
yuri,What doesn't?
ava, My first painting.  I'm officially an artist!
yuri,"How are you, brother?"
vitaly," You know, still the resident family fuck-up."
yuri,Someone has to do it.
vitaly,"She knows, right?"
yuri,We don't talk about it.
vitaly,"Shit, you're good.  You almost had me convinced.  We're going, baby."
yuri," To Manet, Monet...and Ava Cordova."
ava, Yuri!
yuri, The trip went better than expected.
ava, But what am I going to wear them with?
yuri, I know just the outfit.
yuri, Take Park.
yuri, This is good.
valentine,Where in God's name is he going?  Is he lost?
ava, Vitaly...it's Ava.
pilot," --Even taking into consideration the pay-off to the parents, a week with a girl in Burkina Faso is cheaper than a night with a girl in Jersey."
pilot,--and a lot of them speak better English.
yuri," Colonel Southern, it's Yuri.  Sorry to call you on this number but I've got an Interpol jet and--"
yuri, Not a good time!
valentine," --Charlie, Echo, India.  Comply immediately. That was your last warning."
yuri,Where was the first fucking warning?!
valentine, Rock your wings if you intend to comply.
pilot, I'm putting us down.
yuri, You land and we're all going away!  I don't have paperwork!
pilot," We're in a flying fucking bomb!  They're firing bullets at our bullets!  Forget about going away!  They shoot again, we're going away for good!  I'm putting us down."
yuri, Okay!  Okay!--Fuck!!
pilot, This is Charlie Echo India.  Descending on heading zero two nine.
yuri, Not the airport.  There.  The highway.  It's our only fucking hope.
pilot, A pothole could set us off.
yuri,"Don't underestimate yourself.  You're the best, Tony."
interpol pilot,I can't land there.
valentine, He can't get far.  I want a truck waiting on the tarmac.
yuri, We're going to be okay.
pilot,As far from the evidence as I can.
yuri,"Wait, you idiots!  There's not going to be any evidence!  Stay with the plane!"
yuri, Help yourselves.  Be my guest.  No charge.
yuri, What a fucking disaster.
yuri,"Hey, not those!  You don't touch the plane!  Not the fucking seats..."
valentine,"Hey, you!"
mbizi,You run from us.  Can you run with no legs?
valentine,"No, Mbizi.  No, no, no."
mbizi,"Let me disappear him, Mr.  Valentine.  He is a devil.  Let me disappear him."
valentine,I can't do that.
mbizi,Look where we are.  Who will know?
valentine,We will.
mbizi,"Turn your back, Mr. Valentine.  I will go to hell to stop him."
valentine, Find the pilots.
yuri,What's the charge?
valentine,What are you doing in Sierra Leone?
yuri,I'm on safari.
valentine, Shooting wildebeests with submachine guns?
yuri,Are you with the park service?  Hunting without a license - is that the charge?
valentine,You're trafficking arms.
yuri,Trading.  But without evidence who can say?
valentine,"Trade or traffic, you make a fortune by keeping the poorest people on the planet killing each other.  Do you know why I do what I do?"
yuri,"I don't want people dead, Agent Valentine. I admit, a shooting war is better for business.  But I'd prefer people to fire my guns and miss.  Just as long as they're firing."
valentine,I am legally permitted to hold you for twenty-four hours without charging you.
valentine,You'll be pleased to know your colleagues were no more co-operative than you.
vivian, Yuri!  Yuri Orlov!
yuri, Vivian...
vivian,What are you doing here?
yuri, You know.  Fighting the good fight.
vivian,An aid program?
yuri,"Uh, yes.  In fact, I've just had some transport problems.  You couldn't give me a ride to Monrovia, could you?"
vivian,Sure.  Climb in.
yuri,Jesus!  Simeon!
yuri,Me?!
yuri,You stupid old fuck!
yuri,No.
yuri,No.  No.  I...
yuri, Stop.
barman,"He bought you ""brown-brown"", Mr. Yuri."
yuri, What?
barman,"""Brown-brown""."
yuri,What is it?
barman, A mixture - cocaine and gunpowder.
yuri,What does the gunpowder do?
barman,It's magic.  They give it to the small boys before battle - they do anything.
yuri,Some other time.
barman,"You have to try it at least once, Mr. Yuri."
yuri,Why?
barman, Because it's your gunpowder.
yuri, I'm going for a walk.
yuri," I didn't fuck you, did I?  Did I fuck you?"
prostitute, It's not what I would call a fuck.
yuri,Are you sick?
yuri,Hello.
yuri,Simeon.
yuri," Yeah, fuck Andre."
yuri, I'm sorry.  They don't usually do that.  Let me have a look.  Maybe I can fix it.
andre baptiste,"Yuri, you fucked up!  I am going to shoot your face off with your own gun."
yuri, Not bad.  Andre's latest double?
andre baptiste, How did you know?
yuri,He's too eloquent.
andre baptiste,You have no heart.
andre baptiste,"Have you seen the news?  They accuse me of rigging elections, but after this in your Florida with your Supreme Court of kangaroos--"
yuri,"More good news.  That's the last aid shipment.  The war is so bad, the U.N. is pulling out."
andre baptiste,Why is nothing happening?
yuri,There are trucks.  You just have to get all that food out of them.
ava,"Hush, Nicki.  I don't believe you."
valentine,I was hoping you could help us with that.  That regime has startling similarities to several of the regimes supplied by your husband.
ava,Get out.
yuri,"Ava, what's wrong?  Where's Nicki?"
ava, He's with your parents.
yuri,Why aren't you dressed?  I thought we were going out.
ava, I can't wear the clothes.  I can't wear the jewelry.  I can't drive the car.  I can't live in this house.  Everything1s got blood on it.
yuri,Don't be so melodramatic.
ava,"Of course I'm melodramatic.  I'm a failed actress, remember?  We need to talk about it."
yuri,Why?  We never have before.
ava,Now we do.
yuri,These people - you can't trust them--
ava,--I've talked to your parents.  Why do you think they don't want your money?  They know where it comes from.  We all know.
yuri,"I sell people a means to defend themselves, Ava.  That's all.  I don't hold a gun to any one's head and make them shoot--"
ava,"--Yuri, I see the news.  Sierra Leone--"
yuri,--I don't sell machetes.
ava,"--What do you think is pointing at the victims when they use those machetes?  I see the pictures.  Yuri, the guns are bigger than the boys."
yuri, There's nothing illegal about what I do.
ava,"I don't care if it's legal, it's wrong."
ava,Please stop.
yuri, It makes no difference if I stop.  Someone will take my place the next day.
ava,"Let them.  We have enough.  You're not that little boy in Odessa anymore, lining up for a loaf of bread--"
yuri,--It's not about the money.
ava,What is it?
yuri,You can't leave.  I'll stop.  I'll stop.
ava, You will?  You promise?
yuri, Now get dressed.  We'll go out.
yuri, --Impossible.  Two and a quarter?  I can't make a profit at two and a quarter.  Why don't you take my oil and I'll fucking pay you?
ava," Yuri, the President of Liberia is in the lobby."
yuri, He's early.
teenage girl,Liberia.  Is that on Long Island?
yuri," What the fuck are you doing here, Andre?"
andre baptiste, We're here for the peace talks at the U.N.
yuri, So at the same time you thought you'd drop in on your arms dealer?!
andre baptiste,Is that what you still are?  You're a hard man to get hold of all of a sudden.
yuri,I--
andre baptiste,"--But now you mention it, we are doing a little shopping while we're here - that is if you open for business."
yuri, They've got to be watching.
andre baptiste, Of course they blame me.  They always blame me.  They are on a--
yuri, --hunt for a witch?
andre baptiste, That is why I need you.  They are making life difficult to re-supply.  It will require a man of your unusual ingenuity.
yuri,I can't help you.  I'm sorry.
andre baptiste, I understand.
ava, Was that about the oil or the timber?
yuri,Both.  Everything.
yuri,"Hey, not even waiting to say goodbye?  I'm leaving in ten minutes."
ava,"Sorry, Nicki has swim practice."
nicolai,"Bye, Papa."
yuri," See you, big guy."
ava," Personally, I'm glad you're going.  You've been here so long you're starting to get on my nerves."
yuri, This oil concession should be wrapped up by Thursday.  I'll be back for the weekend. We'll go somewhere - the sea.
ava,That would be fun.
yuri,"You trust me, right?"
ava,"Yes, I trust you."
nicolai," Where are we going, Mama?"
ava,It's a game.
nicolai,Like hide and seek?
ava,Yes.
ava," Not that.  Not that, Yuri."
vitaly,Come to see how the other half lives?
yuri,I miss your borscht.  Mom and Dad say you're clean.
vitaly,You too.  They said you went legitimate - hard to believe.
yuri,That's because it's not true.
yuri,Only you know.  I'm leaving tonight - on a job.  I want you to come.
vitaly,I can't.  I'm thinking of opening my own place.
yuri,Maybe this trip will help.  It's good money.
vitaly, I've given my word.
yuri,"They don't have to know.  We'll tell them we're going for a little ""r"" and ""r""."
vitaly,Why do you need me all of a sudden?
yuri,West Africa's fucked-up.  More than usual.  I can't trust anybody.  I need someone to watch my back.
yuri, Where are we going?
vitaly,Jesus.
vitaly,"Yuri, I need to talk to you."
yuri,Not now.
vitaly, Now.
yuri, Excuse me.
yuri, What?
vitaly, We can't do this deal.
yuri, The fuck we can't.
vitaly," Look over there.  As soon as we leave, they're going to die."
yuri, It's not our business.
vitaly, They killed a boy just now - as young as Nicki.
rebel leader,What's the hold up?
yuri, There is no hold up.  I'll be right there.
vitaly,Today we can.  They're right there - close enough to touch.
yuri, What do you think they'll do if we back out - they'll kill us.
vitaly,And if we go ahead - they'll kill them.
rebel leader,What is he saying?
yuri,Nothing.
vitaly," Did I hear you say 300 IPG's, 500 assault rifles and 800 grenades?  I thought it was 1,200 grenades.  I'd better check."
vitaly,Something for Yuri.
yuri,Vit!!
agent," Yuri Orlov, we're with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms."

anatoly,"""Crimean Restaurant""."
irina, Both my sons are dead.
valentine,One of yours?
yuri," If I saw one of those coming at me, l'd have heart failure."
valentine,"We performed the autopsy and released your brother's body to your family.  You tried to do something decent, Yuri.  You went against your nature.  And now it's cost you.  Your brother's funeral is looking a lot like your funeral."
yuri,Falsifying a death certificate?  That's not going to hold me.
valentine,"You're right, as usual."
yuri,Enjoy it.
valentine, What?
yuri,"This.  Tell me that I am everything you despise, that I am the personification of evil, that I'm responsible for the breakdown of the social fabric of society and world order, that I am a one man genocide.  Say everything you want to say to me now - because you don't have long."
valentine,Are you not paying attention or are you delusional?  You've broken every arms embargo written.  There's enough in those briefcases to buy you consecutive life sentences.  You'll spend ten years going from a cell to a courtroom before you even start doing your time.
yuri," My family has disowned me.  My wife and son have left me.  My brother is dead.  Trust me, I fully appreciate the seriousness of my situation.  But I promise you I won't spend a single second in a courtroom."
valentine,You are delusional.
yuri,"I like you, Jack.  Well, maybe not.  But I understand you.  You feel your loyalty to your badge has finally been rewarded.  But you haven't counted on the people who gave you that badge."
yuri, But some of those men are the enemies of your enemies.
valentine,I would tell you to go to hell.  But I think you're already there.
yuri,What if I'm not?  What if I sleep fine at night?  What if I sleep better than you? I think that's what truly scares you.
border officer, Umbrellas - to Saudi Arabia?
yuri,Sun umbrellas.
border officer,Have a safe trip.
yuri,"For someone who's never fired a gun or been in a battle, I have suffered many casualties in my life.  I guess that's how I survived.  I never went to war..."
