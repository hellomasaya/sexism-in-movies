Speaker,Dialogue
the kitchen,"SHANNON PACE carries a bowl filled with a steaming green broth, placing it on the dinner table, moving aside a tiny FIGURINE OF JESUS. The surrounding furniture cluttered with religious knickknacks."
aaron,Special project. It's taking a little more time than I thought.
shannon,Nothing special about milkweed. Unless you like a thorn in the finger.
i aaron,It's not Milkweed. Not this year.
shannon,What is it?
aaron,You'll see. His eyes skate to her face moving in for the kiss -- but he's
aaron,Honey...we know this hasn't been easy for you -- In two years someone else'll study the soil and this'll be their outpost. But for right now -- this is my job.
lucy,I don't know what it's like to have a best friend. To have any friends. I want to have a crush. I want secrets.
shannon,Aaron. She's thirteen -- She should be with children her own age. Aaron lets out a breath.
aaron,"Okay. Next year, we'll figure out a way to get you to a school close by. In town."
aaron,"N year -- that's still plenty of time for you to have a ""crush"". Lucy deflates, knowing this is as good as it's going to get for awhile. Aaron takes her hand."
lucy,"Dear Lord we thank you for what we are about to receive. Blessing us with your gifts... She.speaks with her eyes clenched shut, words spoken sincerely, nothing perfunctory about it. She's a believer."
aa ron,"Shh. He cocks his ear, heading a low rumble. Although he's never heard the sound before...he knows it can' only mean one thing. Trying to remain calm, Aaron goes to the window."
aaron,Get by me. Shannon-and Lucy crouch at his feet.
shannon,"Her body lying in the dirt, head lurching at an obscene' angle. He brushes back her hair -- ere' g UNCT_URE MABKS in hem neck. Crying, he cradles his, wife. Feverishly looking around for"
leader,Go ahead ...scream.
leader,This ain't the war no more. You got no right meddlin'.
the girl,"Gawks at Priest, possibly more frightened of him than the workers. He turns to her, wanting to comfort her but not knowing how -- She flinches and runs away, disappearing into the street. A BEAT as Priest pries the butcher blade from the hand, wiping it off. Tucks it in his waistband. He moves on."
koeppen,"I caught the ambulance picking up what was left of the factory boys...figured it was your handywork. The Shape leans forward, we see it is Priest."
priest,This time there was a little girl.
koeppen,"if this keeps occurring it'll be .impossible to keep it from the Clergy. You'll get us both excommunicated. Priest gazes into the vestibule, his voice almost a whisper."
priest,I want to see the other Priests.
koeppen,You know you can't. The Clergy forbids it.
priest,Why?
koeppen,"They have their reasons. Priest flicks his eyes over Koeppen as if he could see through the vestibule, but his expression doesn't change."
priest,And their reasons for building more and more factories? The sky is turning black.
koeppen,Since when is. industriousness a sin? Did Jesus not teach us to be productive?
priest,You're my friend.
koeppen,"I'm a wicked old man who'd sell his parish for a pint of whiskey. Priest seems to deflate, his hard shell cracking."
priest,"I don't know what's happening to me. (7, Questions. Doubts. I'm not sure what it is. Koeppen slides the vestibule open so they are now face to face."
koeppen,"The devil comes in many shapes. Do yourself a favor, keep your head down. Be smart. And most of all remember your oath... He hands Priest a set of ROSARY BEADS."
priest,Who is it?
priest,"Thank you for meeting with me on such short notice, Monsignors. Even the Monsignors are uneasy'around Priest. Their leader, ORELAS, leans forward, addressing him."
monsignor orelas,Father Koeppen notified us of the situation. Our prayers are with your family.
priest,I come before you because I would like my authority to be reinstated.
monsignor orelas,On what grounds? Priest is taken aback.
priest,"She's my blood, Monsignor."
monsignor orelas,The proper authorities are handling the situation. I'm sure they'll.do a fine job.
priest,The proper authorities?
monsignor orelas,All occurrences of vampire. disobedience and felonies are strictly a Federal matter now.
priest,But Monsignor...they are the enemy.
monsignor orelas,Were.the enemy. The war ended a long time ago.
priest,Not so long that we should forget what they are capable of.
monsignor orelas,You would do well to remember the words of our Savior: Turn the other cheek. Embrace your enemies.
monsignor orelas,"You forget yourself, Priest... It has been brought to our attention that you have engaged in a number of transgressions. Tell me...do you feel yourself to be above God?"
priest,"No, Monsignor."
monsignor orelas,Engaging in any kind of practice is sacrilege -- You bring shame upon our house. Priest turns the full force of his gaze on him.
priest,"""Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father which is in Heaven"" --"
monsignor orelas,You dare quote scripture to met Questioning the . authority. of the Clergy is forbidden1 If you engage in another transgression.you will be stripped from the Order and excommunicated immediately. Do I make myself clear?
priest,"Yes, sir.'"
monsignor orelas,"I said do I make myself clear,. Father."
priest,"Yes, Monsignor."
monsignor orelas,You're a soldier. God's soldier-- Act like one.
koeppen,"I knew I'd find you here. He sits, pouring himself another drink, toasting the poor souls at the surrounding tables."
priest,Why won't they listen to me? A beat. Koeppen takes another drink.
koeppen,Okay. I'm going to.give you one more riddle and if you listen close - you might just hear an answer to your question. 
priest,You know I can't do that.
koeppen,That's what I figured.
priest,Why?
priest,"Then ...I go against God. In an eyeblink -- Priest strips the gun from the nearby officer, CRACKING it against the trooper's head, his attack graceful and precise -- a whirlwind of PINPOINTED BLOWS and SHATTERED BONES. When it's over, eleven troopers lie on the ground writhing. Everything goes quiet."
priest,Folds his hands into the prayer position. VOONI There's a POP OF AIR and ---
silence,The: troopers look around confused -- their guns have disappeared.
koeppe4,"Looks at his fancy whiskey bottle, inside now floats Priest's ROSARY BEADS. He fishes them from the bottle, hand shaking."
koeppen,Heaven help us. He takes a swig.
priest,oh my God...I am sorry for. having offended you. it was never my intention to do so... His words continue OVER
black motorcycle,if this thing were a horse it'd be the ultimate stallion-- Pulse engine. Nitrous. The works. A panel of black titanium solar cells covers the bike like armor. He races onto the street.
vroomi,Priest's cycle streaks across the salt flats. It's glorious.
behind him,"Quietly, A COWBOY HAT and a SHOTGUN BARREL emerge from a hole in the floor."
cowboy hat,"Alright, now -- Not another step. Climbing out from the hole, both barrels pointed, is SHERIFF HICKS . You could say the name fits. But you'd only be half right."
hicks,"Thought you'd come back for a souvenir, hub? You gotta be the dumbest bloodsucker I ever come across. Priest steps into a pool of moonlight, illuminating his face."
priest,"If I was a vampire you'd be dead already. The cross tattoo, a striking image. Hicks stares, pushing his hat back on his forehead."
hicks,"I'll be dammed. He casually spits some ATOMIC CHAW, hitting the floorboards with a SIZZLE."
hicks,"Scuse me a minute, He heads towards the crowd, the salesman continuing his pitch."
powdert," If you care about your loved ones then you MUST have this amazing elixir in your homes tonight -- WHOOSH! A KNIFE slices through the air, spears the sack and pins it to a nearby wall with a THUNK. Hicks steps to the front of the crowd. it's his knife."
hicks,"You best get in that van and clear on out, mister."
hicks,I got six right here.
hicks,That's one. KAPOW! The windshield cracks like a spiderweb.
crocker,You don't know'that. You're just a kid.
hicks,I seen enough two-bit hustlers and carry barkers. He ain't no better.
crocker,But what if he's right? Hicks tosses the sack to Crocker.
hicks,"Take a look.  Ain't nothin' but sand, flour and maybe 'a little garlic.. Oldest trick in the"
woman,And what about the girl? Hicks pauses. This is not easily said.
hicks,"I filed a report with the Cities last night. I'm sure they're Join' all they can. The townspeople mutter amongst themselves. Hicks looks over to Priest, a GROUP OF CHILDREN have already gathered,. pointing and whispering at him."
hicks,"I've already had one of the boys send for your brother. We got him put up at Paddy's place. Priest gazes out . the; window. A group of TOWNSPEOPLE are milling out front, staring at him.. He pulls down the shade."
aaron,"comes through, looking older than the last time we saw him. Seeing Priest, his face cracks, smiling for the first time in days."
aaron,"You came. Overcome, he wraps his arms around his brother, embracing. him. Priest hugs him back."
shannon's coffin,"Lies in a freshly dug hole. Priest sprinkles dirt across.the casket, offering prayers. Aaron watches,. silently. A GROUP OF TOWNSPEOPLE encircle the grave. Everyone wearing black goggles for protection from the swirling dust."
hicks,"Stands apart from the others, hat in his hands. His eyes focused on Priest. Not even watching as -- Aaron plants the RUBY RED FLOWER at the head of the grave. Its glorious color almost obscene in this barren wasteland."
paddy,"Jackrabbit Stew. Never served no man of the cloth before. Hope you like it spicy, Father! He stands over both of them, eager for a response. Priest takes a sip, grimaces, tries his best to smile but fails hideously."
priest,.Delicious
paddy," `Course it isl it was me Ma's recipe. As Paddy jubilantly walks away, Priest puts the bowl on the floor and the dog pads over, eagerly lapping it up. Aaron smiles."
aaron,How come you never came round more? You know you were always welcome.
priest,I know.
aaron,"After the war was over we figured you'd stay with us. Shannon was real fond of you. Lucy too. She was always asking about you. Uncomfortable with the conversation, Priest pulls out a map, unrolling it onto the wooden table. He moves his finger across the paper."
priest,The pack headed in this direction. There's a reservation up that way so that's where I'll start.
aaron,if anyone finds out you're doing this --
aaron,"And you' 11 bring her back to me. Something in Priest's face darkens. He doesn't answer, not able to look his brother in the eye."
clerk,"Good afternoon, sir! How may I be of service?"
priest,I need bullets.
clerk,How many?
priest,How many do you have? The clerk laughs... then realizes he's serious.
clerk,"No offense, Father. You got a permit, right?"
priest,"I have this. He pulls out a sack of coins, it hits the counter with a solid THUD. The clerk smiles wider.."
aaron,Maybe if I knew how to use these she'd still be alive.
priest,Sometimes things just happen. Fault's got nothing to do with it.
aaron,Funny. I'm the one who used to say that. You were the one who always said everything was God's will. Priest takes the bullet from him.
priest,I'm not so sure anymore. There's a KNOCK at the door. Aaron opens it slightly. It's Sheriff Hicks.
hicks,Aaron.
aaron,Sheriff.
hicks,You mind if I have a word-with your brother? An awkward BEAT as the two stare at each other. Both knowing what the other's thinking.
hicks,I'm sure you're well aware of the Vampire Protection Act.
priest,Why?
hicks,"We're the only chance she's got. Priest picks a bullet from the table, a carefully notched CROSS now in its tip . He SNAPS it in the air."
phhhhtti,"Hick's knife FLIES across the room, PINNING the bullet to the wall. A thin trickle of gun powder leaks from its casing, spilling to the floor. The kid's fast."
priest,How you with a gun?
hicks,Better than I am with a knife. Priest considers this.
priest,"I'll be there. Nothing more needing to be said, Hicks turns to walk out, stops at the door."
hicks,What's with all the bullets anyway? I thought Priests don't use firearms.
priest,We don't.
priest,"Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy Kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven... As he continues THE CAMERA slowly moves OUT THE WINDOW and into the night, moving across HALBRIDGE."
aaron,You never talked much about the war but I know you saw things. Bad things.
priest,Yes.
aaron,What'd you do...to make yourself unsee `em? To make it stop playing in your head?
priest,I prayed.
aaron,"Did it help? Priest doesn't answer, the question hanging overhead, a dark cloud."
hicks,Didn't mean to be late -- My deputies are a little green about keepin' the peace all by their lonesome. Needed a pep talk.
aaron,That's just his way. Don't pay it no mind.
hicks,The Nightshade Reservation.. Ain't nothin' but red-outs and rejects. They're a fallen tribe.
priest,Either way. We have two hours to get in and out.
hicks,What happens in two hours?
priest,Sundown. Hicks looks up at the sky. The sun tilting towards the horizon.
hicks,"This is how most of the reservations are these days. We see faces peering out from wooden slats. Gaunt,: lifeless eyes. These'are FAMILIARS."
priest,Familiars are illegal.
hicks,"Nobody really enforces it. most come from the fringes. Drifters. They're creepy as all hell -- but harmless. They turn off their bikes and dismout. Hicks stepping awkwardly between the chickens. A MALE FAMILIAR stands with a butcher knife over a basin. His gaze is slack -- More dead than alive. He picks up a chicken and CHOP1 off goes its head, blood draining into the container. His voice a hissing rasp."
familiar,"Good afternoon, Sheriff... Father. What brings you to Nightshade?"
hicks,We're looking for a Vamp Pack. They woulda' came through here a couple nights ago.
familiar,Nobody comes through Nightshade. That's the way we like it. Nice and quiet.
hicks,Then you won't mind if we have a look around? The Familiar picks up another chicken. Raises the butcher knife.
familiar,Not at all. CHOPI The head clatters to the ground.
priest,We're not going to find anything out here...We have to get into the crypts.
hicks,Not supposed: to do that without a warrant -- BAMI -- Priest kicks the door in. We hear the Familiar SCREECH as Priest steps inside --
crypt familiar,". Got Got You must got Master will be angry! Nicks is grimacing from the stench. He looks at Priest, not happy as he approaches a STONE SARCOPHAGUS. Running his hand over it."
priest,Where's the girl?
crypt familiar,PLEEASE please got
priest,No? Maybe your Master will know.
crypt familiar,NOt NOI THE MASTER CANNOT BE DISTURBEDI Priest rests his hand against the. atone slab covering.the tomb. It must weigh 200 pounds. He moves the slab. Just a centimeter -- but the Familiar screeches.
priest,Wh re is she?
priest,"Your.Master'll be dead. He shoves the slab more, the light rays hanging just outside the edge. And now The Familiar begins to laugh, a horrible rattling sound. Something in his mood has shifted."
crypt familiar,"No, i don't think so. Hearing a noise, Hicks turns, witnessing a horrible sight moving towards him"
a familiar,"Attacks, BUTCHER BLADE raised. CHOP! the blade buries itself in Hicks' arm!"
hicks,"Lets loose with a mean roundhouse. Plugging him in the chest. in one quick motion he rips the butcher blade from his arm, flinging it at the nearest"
familiar,The blade lodges in his skull and he drops like a sack. These guys move surprisingly fast -- Hicks is already surrounded. He hears a whistling noise as
hicks,"Pulls off his COWBOY HAT. Activating a release. With a CLICK! thousands- of needle--like teat ext e d fro the brim. With deadly accuracy, he flings the hat: It FLASHES through the air, DAIS'iWHEELING around a Familiar's neck, pinpricking his skin and finally whirling back to Hicks' band likean obedient pup. A BEAT as the Familiar stands, mouth agape. Then with a wet SNAP his head rolls off his shoulders, THUDDING in the dirt. Hicks falls to the ground, his wound starting to get the best of him. He musters up his strength for another hat attack but before he can --"
priest,Leaps in front. Blocking his way.
priest,"Not yet. With a HORRIBLE SCREECH the Familiars attack, LAUNCHING at Priest and Hicks. Blades in the air."
crypt familiar,"It's our time now. We hear a LOW RUMBLE from inside the crypts. Priest looks at Hicks, a feeling of dark electricity in the air, anticipation."
priest,They get your gun arm?
hicks,Why?
priest,You're gonna need it.
black shapes,"BURST from the crypt doorways SCREECHING as they fly into the air. Circling above the reservation like a nest of angry hornets. Disturbed. WHOOSH! One of the figures SWOOPS low, touching to the ground. Giving us our first good look at a vampire; Wet, white skin. Insect clicking claws. Black eyes. Fangs. More creature than human. The vampire cackles, sounds like dried paper, its voice a series of teeth clicking hisses. as it eyes Priest angrily."
lead vampire,"What are you doing here,. Priest... haven't you already done enough?"
priest,"We don't want a fight. We're just looking for the girl. The vampire sneers and as it speaks the following -- one by one, the OTHERS drop from the sky, flanking him. They're scraggly, a little undernourished."
lead vampire,"Look at us -- Living in ruin, forced to feed off the blood of animals. We once scoured 'this land. We were warriors...we were Gods!"
priest,You were murderers.
lead vampire,We were what nature made us.  I recommend you leave immediately...You are not welcome here.
priest,We're not going anywhere until you tell us where she is.
lead vampire,"Then you aren't going anywhere,. If there was a tumbleweed in the vicinity this is when it would blow by. A tense BEAT then. . .Priest pulls out a BLACK BOOK."
priest,",,Yea though r walk through the Valley Of The Shadow Of Death x will fear no Evil -- "" The vampires laugh. Fangs glinting."
lead vampire,"--'Your words mean nothing to us, Priest. And now we see the book's actually hollow on the inside, filled with dozens of .little STAR-METAL CROSSES."
the crosses,"CUT through the air, heading straight for the BLACK FIGURE. S t SOUEAL.S as the metals; it like hot goals through 1 err tC erina it apart, the pieces raining' down around Hicks, crashing to the ground. And then all hell breaks loose. The Nightshade Vampires hiss. Bearing their fangs like cobras and taking to the air with a SHRIEK. Attacking. Frightened beyond shit-all-belief -- Hicks FIRES wildly, chasing the creatures with his gunfire. His bullets whistling harmlessly through the air. WHOOSH! A vampire swoops towards him, fangs bared, claws ready to rip."
hicks,"Dazed, watches as the vampire's body erupts with death spasms, arms and legs kicking the air in a violent frenzy until finally all life drains away."
hicks," Jesus. Another VAMPIRE careens towards him. Coming in low, crawling across the ground on all fours. Fangs dripping. Hicks FIRES off a mess of bullets, peppering the creature as it flails backwards screeching. He snaps out the empty shells, reloading almost supernaturally fast, firing off a shot that SPLITS the Vampire's throat. He twirls the gun, flipping it into his holster. This leaves only"
priest,"No need. He'll the at first light. Priest goes to the Familiars still lying on the ground. They're sobbing, having lost everything in the world that mattered. Completely wrecked. He grabs one by the scruff of the neck."
familiar, -- The metal beast! She's in the metal beast!
priest,Make 'sense.
sharp claws,"Suddenly RIP across Priest's back! It's the Lead Vampire, back for more. Claws digging into flesh. Priest wrenches around and the two go at it. A fierce, feral battle. The Vampire's fangs chattering inches from his neck. Their bodies lock in a horrible struggle, rolling across the Familiars. The Vampire's claws CHURNING into their bodies, killing them instantly."
the vampire,"Throws Priest into a crypt, SMASHING him through the wall, flying in after him. We hear the sounds of a BATTLE ROYALE from inside. WHUMPI WHUMPI WHUMP! The walls buckle outward, sounds like the fury of all hell being unleashed. Then, suddenly, and'more disturbingly...,s  g. Hicks takes a step towards the crypt. Gun leveled. But --"
priest,"Emerges through the hole, exhausted, the LEAD VAMPIRE'S HEAD in his hand dangling by its hair. He tosses the head and it rolls to Hicks' feet, fangs flashing up at him. Hicks stares at the ghastly visage. Unnerved."
priest,How's your arm?
hicks,"Lucky I guess. The blade didn't go that deep.  Don't know what got into those Familiars to attack like that. They're usually harmless. Priest finds a KNIPE clutched in a dead Familiar's hand, tucks it in his waistband."
priest,Usually. A BEAT as they listen to the popping of the fire. A tension hanging between them. Then -
hicks,"You did this on purpose, didn't you? You knew we wouldn't. be out before sundown. You wanted this to happen."
priest,You don't have the stomach for it --head back to Haibridge right now. Hicks glares at Priest.
hicks,The stomach I got. I was in the Rangers two years. Even fought in the Boondock Uprising...I saw some crazy things.
priest,Killing a vampire isn't like killing a man. They come at'you like an animal. Tooth for tooth.
hicks,it comes easy to you... don't it?
priest,What?
hicks,Killin'.
priest,"it just comes. Easy's got nothing to do with it. He pokes at the fire, it CRACKLES, feeding off the bodies. Something about the battle's opened him up. His guard's down."
priest,Give me your gun.
hicks,What?
priest,Give me your gun.
hicks,"Why? You gonna shoot me now? Priest's stare is piercing. A pause then Hicks pulls his six shooter, handing it to him. Priest checks the chambers, giving it a quick spin."
priest,"Don't anticipate the trajectory of your target. Know it. He stomps his foot into the fire, launching a GLOWING COAL OF ASH into the air. Priest quickly raises the gun and FIRES, the ash explodes, raining fiery red sparks."
hicks,You're teaching me to shoot?
priest,I'm teaching you to kill vampires. No more wild shots --
hicks,My ass I In case you didn't notice I was pretty damn good out there! And I sure as hell didn't see you doin' much when I had that blade buried in my arm.
priest,There's always-two points. A and B. Know the points and you'll know your target.
hicks,Ain't nothin' but a bunch of bullshit.
priest,"I see ten crypts ...but only eight vampires. We find the missing, we'll find-Lucy.' What's the next nearest town?"
hicks,Jericho. It's clear across the Plains. Gonna be a rough ride.
priest,"Then you better get a good night's sleep. This bunch was easy, their bloodlines watered down by man."
familiar,"A man came on board at the last stop. Says he has something for you. The Figure nods. We-FOLLOW as he continues to the back of --- the car, sliding open the door"
black hat,I can SMELL the blood racing through your veins... Smells like dinner. The salesman starts to shake.
black hat,A Priest?
lucy,"Lying on the floor, her face streaked with tears. Vestiges of the girl we met earlier already lost."
lucy,I won't tell anyone if you let me out...I promise.
black hat,"You're in here for your own protection...If I let you out of this car you'll be torn apart a piece at a time. He walks to her, face still hidden in shadow. She starts to cry, pulling back to the wall. Angry."
lucy,My uncle's a Priestl one of the best. Hooll corns after youl The Figure laughs. Bending down to her level --
black hat,I'm absolutely counting on it. And now we get our first look at her captor. A cross tattoo h s adows his face. The mark of the Priest.
the plains,"They sit parked on a bluff, the emptiness making Hick's eyes ache. A more desolate view couldn't be found in all of hell."
hicks,Walkin' Pete talked about this place -- said it. used to be really somethin'. Everythin' growin' green as a goddamn dollar bill. . 'Course we had to go and screw it up by poisonin' everythin' -- nothin' pretty survives this world ...nothin' decent anyways.
priest,How's your arm?
hicks," Sore. Cut's still open. As Hicks hands the canteen back, Priest suddenly grabs his arm it's completely healed. Not even a scar."
priest,"You're a halfbreed. A BEAT as Hicks looks to the ground, when he speaks, it's in a voice just below his breath."
hicks,"My grandmother... she was raped. Nobody knows -- It's recessive in my family. No bloodthirst. No light sensitivity. I'm not proud... but it's a part of me. Ain't nothin' I can do.  I woulda told you...just didn't want you treatin' me no different. It hangs there. the'silence stretching like a rope,then Priest REVS his cycle; a flurry ofdust kicking up as he speeds away. HOLD ON HICKS -- Eyes stinging, he watches Priest. Finally he starts his bike, following."
hicks,"Gotta be a desert rat. They park their bikes about twenty feet from the rickety structure, Hicks stepping off his bike and approaching. Carefully."
old man,Take another step and you'll be meetin' the Lord directly.
hicks,"Easy now old timer. I'm a sheriff. The old man snorts, spitting a thick stream of tobacco,. it sizzles when it hits the dust."
old man,"Ain't no law out here but my own. Calm and cool, Priest shifts in his seat, drawing his gaze."
old man,"Cleaned the place up a bit. Been years since I had any kind of company 'sides jackrabbits but I knew you was comity' -- Dreams don't lie.' Ignoring Hicks, the old man pours BLACK TEA into a rusty can, handing it to Priest."
hicks,Sounds like a bunch of religious mumbo jumbo to me. The old man stares fixedly at Priest.
old man,"Now you tell the Clergy this here is an authentic miracle, I want it registered. It's mine."
priest,Miracle?
old man,"The Angels. Never seen so many loot souls, breaks my heart just to think of it. This ain't no place for nothin' divine. The man's fevered belief unsettles Priest, he's unsure how to respond."
priest,You saw angels?
old man,Sure as chit.
priest,How many?
old man,"Don't know, too many to count. Hundreds. Thousands. Some nights the sky was so thick you couldn't see the stars. His eyes suddenly light up, remembering something. i OLD MAN  Here! Look at this -- He goes to a shelf, it's been turned into a MAKESHIFT SHRINE -- rw=ging through a jumbled collection of crucifixes, yellowed photographs, collected junk. He pulls out a GLASS JAR containing SOMETHING MISSHAPEN floating in murky water, the old man proudly showing it to Priest and Hicks."
hicks,What is it?
old man,It's their spoor! They'd be flyin' above and this stuff would drop from the sky like manna.
hicks,That's angel shit?
old man,"Scooped it up myself.  You wanna hold it? Hicks backs away, shaking his head."
priest,These angels...di.d you ever see them during the day?
old man,"No, I reckon'. that's when they'd go back home for some shut eye -- Gettin' the world ready for the rapture takes a lot of work. Praise God."
priest,Home?
old man,"The castle - .:,He:points out the window, far away, atop a craggy peak sits the -remains of a CASTLE --"
old man,"Wait! I want you to have somethin' before you go He presses a HOMEMADE CROSS into Priest's hand. It's a real beauty, flecked with colored stones. A lot of love and care went into this one."
lucy,"Thank you. The Familiar turns to leave. WHAPI Lucy SLAMS the tray over his head and he collapses to the floor. She makes a run for it. But the Familiar manages to grab her ankle.knocking her down, she kicks at him as he holds fast, hissing. Two more FAMILIARS run in and grab her arms, wrestling her to the floor. She struggles furiously but it's no use, she screams as we CUT TO:"
priest,Vampires sometimes use abandoned structures as a perch.  Watch for booby traps. And with that he enters the--
hicks,Why we listen' to that crackpot? Crazy fucker's so blinded by faith he's batahit. That's called a zealot in my. book.
hicks,"This is bullshit. Lucy's been gone five days'-- every stupid minute we waste here is a minute more she gets farther-away. Priest turns and sees a STONE STAIRCASE, uneven steps leading. downwards...too dark to tell where though."
priest,"Stay here. If anything comes up the steps that isn't me -- Shoot it. Before Hicks can reply,.Priest heads down the stairs, darkness swallowing him with every step."
hicks,Great.
a catacomb,"Actually more a cave. Miles and miles. Twisting, jagged and moist. Endless corners, weaving into a dark and hideous maze. Priest heads into it"
two bodies,splayed across the ground like rag dolls. He crouches to take a closer look...
priestess,"How did you find me? Priest doesn't reply. She narrows her eyes, suspicious."
priest,No.
priestess,I've been busy. Off Priest's reaction we CUT TO:
hicks,"Shit. He wipes the blood on his pants, not noticing as a A LARGE SHAPE looms in the archway behind him..."
priestess,If you didn't come for me...why are you here?
priest,I should be asking you the same question.
priestess,There's another one around here somewhere.
priest,Where?
priestess,I don't know...but it's not like the others. They're interrupted by the sound of GUNFIRE echoing off the tunnel walls. Priest turns.
priest,Hicks. He starts down the tunnel. The Priestess quickly following.
priest,It's too big to fit down here. That's why you're still alive.
hicks,What the hell is that thing?I
hicks,I'm not stupid. Vampires don't look like that.
hicks,"Who the hell are you?! (7, She doesn't even bother to respond,.just shooting a look as the two warriors bound"
the vampire,"A fearsome creature -- much more terrifying than the Nightshade variety. Bigger, more ferocious. The ancient cousin to the more modern vampire. The beast opens its mouth and lets loose with a SCREAM, its breath vile."
the priests,"Split up. The Priestess LEAPING to the stone wall and climbing up the rock. Priest goes the opposite way, ROLLING across the floor, keeping low."
the vampire,"With a screech, goes for the Priestess. Crawling up the wall, hunched like a rat, talons ferociously . digging, into: rock. Coordinating an attack wordlessly, the Priests make their move:"
the priestess,"Lets go of the wall, PLUMMETING straight towards the vampire, the creature FLASHING its fangs in anticipation."
priest,"Leaps from below, darting up the rock, taking advantage of the distraction, landing on the creature's back and wrapping his arms around its neck. Going for the deathlock. With a SHRIEK the creature WHIPS its head with crack force sending Priest flying. The Priestess, still in mid-drop, CATCHES him and they both hit the ground with their feet."
priestess,Should we lead it into open air? More room to. maneuver.
priest,"Better to keep it contained. The vampire's lathered into an animal frenzy now, wailing and scuttling around the circular wall in crazy patterns. Suddenly -- with a stone shattering BOOM! it BURSTS through the hole, FLYING out into the night."
priestess,Or not. They race outside.
priest,"Darts behind a boulder just in time. The creature's talons SCRAPING at the rock before it soars back to the sky, He pulls out his bible, grabbing and tossing a handful of --"
throwing crosses,"CUTTING through the air, sparkling in the moonlight, beautiful. BUT They BOUNCE harmlessly off the creature's wings, knifing back to the ground, imbedding deep in the stone, Priest having to nimbly: dodge his own weaponry. THE CREATURE HOWLS! Blazing straight for him. Undaunted. Priest looks at the Priestess and folds his hands into the prayer position, leveling his breath, pulse slowing as the screaming beast bares down like a freight train!"
the priestess,"Quickly scoops up TWO LARGE ROCKS -- HURTLING them towards the vampire. HER EYES LOCK WITH PRIEST'S as she too folds her hand, into the prayer position."
priestess,"Not bad. Suddenly the CREATURE'S BODY erupts into ablistering death spasm! Talons clacking like STRAIGHT RAZORS, flailing dangerously close to the two of them."
bami,"A single bullet. pierces its heart and the body collapses with a THUD. Once and for all -- dead. ANGLE ON HICKS in the archway, smoke coming off his gun. He looks at the Priests."
hicks,"Point A...meet point fuckin' B. He smiles, twirling his six shooters back into their holsters."
priest,This was a Pureblood.
priestess,we both know that's impossible -- They haven't existed for a millennium.
priest,.I don't know. A BEAT filled with awkward silence -- when the Priestess kt speaks it comes as a relief for both. An unloosening of things long held tight.
priestess,Sector Seven was the only place I could find work. Waste Management.
priest,I heard that one too.
priestess,"A week ago, a family camping out on the Perimeter approached me --.Told me vampires were terrorizing their village and that the government wouldn't do anything about it."
priest,Did you go to The Clergy?
priestess,"They wouldn't see me,"
priest,Could be. The Priestess glances towards Hicks.
priestess,Does the lawman know what you'll do if you find her?
priest,He knows.
priestess,He'll try to stop you.
priest,"He won't be able to. She pauses a moment, regarding him."
priestess,"You know, some nights I still dream we're back on the frontlines ... I wake up, I'm sweating... my muscles all clenched like I'm ready for something -- But I don't know what."
priest,Me too.
priestess,Nights like that ...I don't go back to sleep.
priest,..Like what?
priestess,"You. Priest stares at her, not sure what to say. Lucky for him, the moment gets interrupted by --"
hicks," - Hey.you guys better get a look at thisl The warriors lock eyes, knowing something's been started -- but.unsure of what. They head down the stone steps."
priestess,it must be a birthmark of some kind.
hicks,"That ain't no birthmark -- it's a brand. The Priestess studies the mark, something about it making her skin crawl. Maybe because it's in'theshape of a top hat."
priestess,There's something else you need to see...
priestess,I found this just before I was attacked -
priest,It's a tomb. Big enough for an army.
hicks,Guess they're not as endangered as everyone thought.
priest,Only one way to find out...
hicks,"Are Priests allowed to, you know...have relations?"
priestess,We take a vow of celibacy at inception. Hicks can't be sure -- did she just look at Priest when she said that?
hicks,"Look...I was uh, wondering --. how did he do that little stunt back there?"
priestess,All Priests can do it.
hicks,Including you? She nods.
priestess,No trick. You just have to remember.
hicks,Remember... what?
priestess,Time is relative.
huge chamber,"Not like the cave, this is more earthen. Like the inside of a wasp nest, curved walls made of dirt and spit, Priest covering his nose and mouth as he's hit with a massive stench."
priest,You said the next nearest town was Jericho.
hicks,Yeah.
priest,Then we better go see.
hicks,. See what?
priestess,-- What they left of it. PUSH IN ON HICKS -- knots of rope tightening in his stomach... only now realizing how truly black the path before him will be.
railroad tracks,"CLACK past at a furious speed, inches from his head! The noise is deafening.."
ohb slips,"Catching herself just in time. Her eyelids practically brushing the wood. Taking a deep breath, she manages to hoist herself through the rest of the way finally making it to the CABOOSE. She pulls herself up onto the back of the car. Now what? The train is blazing past the wasteland at an incredible speed. Only one thing to do. She makes the sign of the cross, closes her eyes and JUMPS"
priest,"We separate. Go through each building, see what we find."
hicks,I'll start with the sheriff.
priestess,"Be careful. Just because it's daylight doesn't mean it's safe. Hicks nods, tightening the twin BANDOLEERS across his chest."
hicks,"'Damn. He shakes his head, heading towards the holding area as --"
hicks,There ain't nobody left. Nobody.
hicks,Where's Priest?
priest,"On the ground KNEELING. Head down, engaging in some kind of prayer. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they slowly approach, wondering what the hell is going on. As they get closer they see the full"
faces,They're Priests.
hicks,Don't make no sense. What were they doin' out here?
priestess,The same thing as us.
hicks,"Who? The Priests just stare into the fire, not having any idea."
priest,We're not going back.
priestess,We'll burn for this.
priest," We already are. Something in the flames catches the Priestess's eye, in the charred remains of one of the corpses -- SOMETHING'S GLOWING. She wraps her arm, plunging her hand through the bones, pulling out the object. Quickly, she tosses it into a'barrel of water. it hisses, steam rising as it cools. Priest reaches into the barrel, his hand emerging with a"
hicks,It's a railroad spike. My pop used to work boxcars before they shut down -- Why the hell would anyone wanna swallow that? A beat as Priest puts it together.
priest,He wanted us to find it. It's a clue.
priestess,Where's the closest track?
hicks,"The Dunkirk Line. It starts all the way in the backcountry, bought the ore from the deep mines. There were about five stops along the route. I think. He draws several Xs along the line. His hand coming to a stop on a particular forboding PATCH OF MOUNTAINS."
priest,Where? He draws one final X at the end of the line. Looks up.
hicks,The Cities. So there it is. The Priestess narrows her eyes.
priestess,"They must have been picking up different factions along the way. Moving during the day, feeding at night."
hicks,"But headin' to the Cities is suicide. The sun will kill `em -- there's nowhere to hide. Priest gazes at the map, deeply troubled."
priest,They won't have to. And with the SHRIEK of the train whistle we CUT TO:
the camera,"Overtakes the train. Snaking along the rail at an incredible speed, leaving the train in its tracks  as it blisters across the Wasteland through craggy mountains and finally ending up in"
dark figemh,"A fine catch yes? (the voice is oily, a dark"
black hat,"What do you want for her? And now her captor lifts his hat -- revealing paper-thin skin, eyes like black coal. This is RUNE, a bounty hunter."
rune,"You know what r want. Black Hat's eyes flick upwards, glinting in the. candlelight."
black hat,"Don't. go too far, Rune."
rune,He comes for her still.
black hat,Of course he does.
rune,Let me have him.
black hat,"No. Rune smiles,'revealing an impressive set of vampire fangs."
black hat,Don't get involved in this.
rune,I was involved long before you showed up.
black hat,"Fine. He's Yours. As if on command, the finger retreats back into the jacket, Lucy COLLAPSING to the floor coughing and choking."
rune,"And -- she's yours. He laughs, sounds like a death rattle, dropping the cigar to the floor, spurs chiming as he walks out the car door, long dark coat fluttering behind him, disappearing into the night."
black hat,"Annoyed, picks up the still burning cigar, squeezing it in his hand. He turns to Lucy."
black hat,And as for you uy dear...You're more trouble than I anticipated. Must be your uncle's blood in you.
hicks,Beggar's Pass...it ain't gonna be easy. As if on cue the last rays of the sun wink out behind the mountain.
hicks,If we push it hard we'll gain two days on 'em. Should be enough to get us a jump.
priestess,We'need more than a jump. We need a miracle.
hicks,"That's the funny thing about time -- He dips his hand in the water and raises it, letting the liquid leak from between his fingers."
priestess,"You should try harder, sheriff. She cups her hand in the water, bringing it to her lips for a drink. Hicks smiles, leaning forward, something on his mind."
hicks,You ever regret it? Bein' a Priest?
priestess,No.
hicks,"What about a husband, children...A family?"
priestess,I've had a family -- just not the kind you're familiar with.
hicks,What? You mean Mr. Laffs over there?
priestess,"He's not so bad once you get to know him. A beat, Hick's expression becoming serious."
hicks,"He's going to kill her, isn't he? If. she's turned."
priestess,Yes.
hicks,There's things that can be done. She doesn't have to die.
priestess,"She's his bloodline... and he's a Priest. It's the only way. Hicks tosses the rest of his food into the fire, troubled, but he knows there's no point in discussing it any further... for now."
hicks,And how many of you Priests are left now? A long moment before she speaks.
priestess,"Two. Hicks doesn't know what to Say-,,"
hicks,".I'm sorry.,"
priestess,"Yes. She nods, though in affirmation of what Hicks's isn't sure. He watches her as she stares'into the fire. We FADE TO BLACK:"
priestess,"They know we're here. From under the earth A HAND SHOOTS UP, grabbing onto a Priest's leg, pulling him down. Suddenly DOZENS OF VAMPIRES emerge, seemingly birthed from the soil. The warriors fight valiantly. Fiercely. But it's too much. Most are quickly cut down."
priest,Retreat!
fearsome priest,"Battles like a tiger, grappling with TWo VAMPIRES, their claws at his throat, fangs inches from his face. A couple of quick moves and - before you realize how - the vanires lay dead. He quickly joins the surviving Priests as they run through the hive, a dizzying maze of MUDDY TUNNELS AND TRENCHES."
priestess,Why would the Clergy forbid us from seeing each other?
priest,Maybe they were scared of what we could do.
priestess,Or what we would do.
priest,With or without the Clergy...we're still Priests. And we're the only ones who can stop that train.
priestess,If we survive this we need to expose them for what they are.
priestess,You scared to die?_
priest,No.
priestess,"I believed in Heaven my whole life. Believed everything we were taught -- And now...when it's finally my time...no more faith. They took it away from me. Priest gazes at her, trying his best to be comforting."
priest,"Whatever happens. .. Wherever it is we go. We'll go together. At that.exact moment something inside Priest shifts just a little bit, a door opens -- never to be shut again."
priestess,What?
priest,It's a riddle. The Priestess thinks about it.
priestess,The good nights.
priest,Yes. The good nights. Do you think maybe tonight...
priestess,"Could be one of those nights? She smiles. And then Priest does the most amazing thing. . .he smiles back. Things happen fast -- He finds himself planting his mouth on hers... the years of conditioning, all the ritual and tradition falling away in a flash. And it is here, together in this place, where they feel like they finally truly belong. The last two."
hicks,"I- ee itl Hicks points, reaching the top of the mountain."
priest,"I know you're there. A slight sound, the mist whipping into a pool as if something just moved through it. Priest quickly turns but there's nothing there."
priest,"This isn't the time to settle old scores, Rune."
priest,I'm older now. We can almost bear Rune smile.
priest,"It was a war, Rune."
rune,"It still is He launches at Priest, duster fluttering like wings. The two grapple, Rune's fangs brushing Priest's neck. It's a savage battle, Priest's muscles and laser-like focus the only thing keeping him alive as Rune flies back across the canyon, landing against the rock wall like.a spider. Hunched, ready to strike BUT --"
the priestess,"Appears from within the mist, already in mid-leap, she lands beside Priest. The two together, a formidable presence. But Rune's a tough customer, he readies himself for another attack. ough h2 mist a single CLICKING sound. Rune looks over, sees --"
hicks,Six-shooter pointed right at him.
rune's body,"Drops from the fog, hitting the ground with a thud. Dead. And now Hicks turns -- points his revolver at Priest. Catching both he and the Priestess by surprise."
hicks,Tell me you won't kill her. Priest doesn't reply.
priest,Finally showing your true colors. A beat. The Priestess looks at Hicks.
priestess,What's he talking about?
priest,He's a halfbreed. Hicks cocks the gun.
hicks,Don't turn this into somethin' it's not.
priest,You've been itching to do this since Nightshade.
hicks,"She's your kin, goddamit!"
priest,if she's turned...she's nobody's kin.
hicks,"Things can be done. Things to lessen the thirst. She can have a normal life, she doesn't have to die. Priest nods grimly."
priest,It's our way.
hicks,"And what is that? Some special Priest code of honor? You don't get it. Your ""way' -- It's over!"
priest,"Shoot me and it won't matter if you find Lucy. You won't stop that train -- and you won't save her. The Priestess steps between them, looks at Hicks."
priestess,"He's right. We need to be together on this... it's the only shot we have. Hicks thinks about it, knows she's right. A tense beat then"
hicks,"This ain't done. He lowers his gun and walks away. The two warriors stand together, the Priestess gazing at Priest...hedoesn't return it. Without a word, he heads back to his cycle. She doesn't see as his hand touches his stomach. It comes up red."
salt flats,"wheels kicking up sheets of sand and grit, spattering their faces. The train dead in their sites."
priest,"Make sure you get on that train,"
priest,"is thrown! His beloved bike FLIPPING across the desert in wild arcs. He hits the earth with a painful skid, using the momentum to roll back onto his feet. He checks his stomach, the wound's of enina t,}g xnorA, staining his shirt bright red. No time for first aid as he turns just in time to see"
two riders,"Throwing a STEEL CHAIN to the other, pulling the line taut, ready to take him out. Approaching fast."
priest,"Snaps the chain above his head, bullwhip style, LASHING out. The sound of metal shredding as it tangles in Rider #1's handlebars, the bike SWEEPING into the other, CRASHING in a tangled mess. With a SNARL the fallen riders LAUNCH at Priest. These vampires are different than the Nightshade tribe. Stronger, quicker. Squat bodies of clenched muscles and fangs."
priest,"Rips the BLAST HELMETS off his two attackers. With a SCREECH, their faces burn, bodies instantly SLACKENING in the harsh sun. Priest CRUNCHES a vampire in the ribs, knocking the creature off his bike. In a flash, he FLINGS.a helmet into the housing of the last cycle, the bike nosedives, sending the rider across the desert. Eyes brimming with renewed fury, Priest picks up the cycle, VROOOOMI! GUNNING the throttle, mod. ROCKETING towards the train..."
priestess," You ready? Hicks nods, maneuvering to the side of his bike and jumping to the Priestess's, his cycle crashing into the dirt as he LEAPS onto the back of the train."
hicks,"My.tuxn now, Priest. BAMI He kicks the door in"
priest,"Seemingly from out of nowhere, motors up to the train car riding the vampire cycle. He grabs onto a gun barrel and SWINGS into an arc, lifting himself off the bike and -"
black hat,"""And the third day He shall rise again. Priest can't believe it, seeing his long dead comrade, his face etched with shock, all he can do is ask --"
priest,".How? Black Hat smiles, baring hi fangs."
black hat,"Oh ye of little faith. The understanding hits Priest immediately, crashing over him like a wave."
priest,.They turned you.
black hat,"No, Priest...I turned them. He smiles wider as we CROSSCUT TO:"
black hat,"Lost souls abandoned by divinity. No belief, no voice to guide them through the wilderness. Sound familiar? Priest doesn't reply, warily eyeing him."
priest,By murdering innocents?
black hat,"By drawing a once great race back to their""nature. By helping them discover' the mastery within themselves."
priest,who?
black hat,"Me. Something in the distance catches Priest's eye, a BLACK SPEC on the horizon -- It's The Cities. His jaw tightens, he knows there isn't much time."
priest,So this is how you go about it? One by one killing every last remaining Priest?
black hat,It was the only way. The Cities are defenseless now...no one left to stop us from entering our Eden. But I was kind -- I gave every last one the choice I never had.
priest,Yours.
black hat,"They taught us God created man in His image. . .but they lied. Man created God in a image -- And so, like man, God is weak. Corrupt. Merciless. He wipes away a streak of blood from his cheek."
priest,I don't believe you.
black hat,Your faith has failed you Priest.
priest,"With ferocious instinct, he launches forward, feet digging into the metal. The two bodies COLLIDE w th Mic impact. Rolling across the roof, bodies twisting to the edge before FLIPPING onto the next car. The warriors rise, locked in a furious coil.as WHOOSHI train car after train car passes beneath them. Each leaping at j ust the right moment to land onto the next. But Priest is,outmatched. As they hit the final car, Priest flies across the roof catching the edge with his hand just before he goes over, his body dangling over the side. Exhausted and bloodied."
black hat,Your problem is you keep looking to God for-your power -- But I know the real truth.
massive pistons,"Pump up and down furiously, moving so fast they blur, turning the-giant DRIVE WHEELS that power the locomotive. ANGRY BLASTS OF STEAM vent whi te hot from between the wheels, just missing the Priestess. She reaches into her pack and lugs out a CROWBAR, pulling up to the beast and managing to stick it between the pistons hoping to jam up the works. The machine chews it up like candy."
hicks,"Shit. With a WAIL, the vampires quickly scramble from their coffins, sharp talons scratching at the wood, snapping the planks. Desperate, he wrenches open the door, darting into --"
hicks turns,"The WILD-EYED FAMILIAR charges, attacking from behind, having unlocked the chain and opened the door. He SCREAMS, sinking a KNIFE in Hicks' side! Hicks spins, slamming his attacker in the nose with a palm heel strike, knocking the Familiar out instantly. Hicks pulls the knife out, blood flowering across his shirt as the vampires continue to PUMMEL the door behind, him. He trips over the chain and staggers into --"
hicks,"'Dam. He site on the floor, breathing hard, knowing this is as far as he goes. Gradually another sound becomes audible. Hicks listens, nervous. He holds his breath straining to hear. It's someone else's BREATHING."
hicks,"Lucy, my name is Sheriff Hicks...I'm here to take you home. No response. She seems almost catatonic. He reaches into his pocket, pulling out her photograph, showing it to her."
a talon,"Reaches through the opening, long bony fingers swiping at Hicks like switchblades as he falls backwards, pain shooting up his body. ANOTHER ARM breaks through the small window, clawing at the air, the door BANGING REPEATEDLY against the chain. Hicks places himself between Lucy and the door, not noticing as she eyes the blood soaking through his shirt."
one vampire,"Manages to scramble through, it charges at Hicks, fangs glistening. BAMI With a twitch, it collapses in a heap, a well placed bullet between the eyes."
hicks,"Lucy? WHAM! A WOODEN. PLANK slams him over the head, knocking the gun from his hand. Woozy, he spins around to find Lucy standing over him, holding the plank above her head. He scoots back just as WHAM! the plank comes back down again, splintering apart across the floor."
a fist,"PUNCHES through a BOARDED UP HOLE in the floor , wood splintering into tiny shards. Hicks takes advantage of the distraction and SLUGS Lucy, knocking her unconscious. He dives for his gun, scooping it up and leveling it at the hole, ready to fire at whatever's coming through..."
it's priest,"He sticks his head through the opening, having been drawn by the sound of gunfire. Hicks can't believe it."
priest, Give her to me! Hurry!
a vampire,"Jabs its head through the hole, teeth chattering-- but the creature can't go any further, the sunlight already making its skin smoke. On his back, Hicks worms his way down,. following Priest.as they climb up a LADDER attached to the side of the train."
hicks,We should jump!
priest,"Not until we stop the trains But now Hicks isn't even looking at him, his attention caught up in the horrible sight waiting ahead of them."
on priest,"Horrified, realizing what she's going to do...and powerless to stop her."
priest,"What happens next happens fast: Priest GRABS Hicks, folding his body around both he and Lucy, hands coming together in prayer, feet leaving the train as -- E ERYTH ggas BLACK The sound of a heartbeat.A threshold. A zone of transition. A BRIGHT FLASH -- we see the TRAIN collide with the. Priestess. The massive grill of the engine CRUMPLING AROUND HER as if smashing into a building. She doesn't move. A BRIGHT FLASH -- one by one the train cars SLAM into each other, the cars JUMPING the rails. MMMM gQES BLACK A BRIGHT FLASH -- and now Priest is falling through the air, his body shielding Hicks and Lucy, train care skipping across the earth, careening through the air."
priest,"He stands, bruised and bloody, staring at the sky. Watching. A dazed Hicks beside him, Lucy in his arms as she comes to. A HORRENDOUS SCREECH fills the air. Led by the Purebloods, HUNDREDS OF VAMPIRES fly out from within the broken cars, taking to the sky in a massive black swarm, tangling together in flowing shapes. Beautiful. Terrifying. Then in one horrible instant -- They TURN as if guided by an unseen hand, flying towards the Cities. Sensing the blood that awaits."
priest,"No, they're not."
the sun,"PUNCHES through the teeming mass. A few rays at first, but then more and more,-cracking through the black tide like shattered glass. Hicks' eyes, widen, witnessing an amazing eight as the vampires' bodies collectively BLACKEN and SHRIVEL the swarm withering... quickly becoming nothing more than husks. Floating black kites. Hicks and Priest stand, surrounded by the epic destruction, fire and smoke casting everything in a surreal haze."
hicks,You knew they wouldn't make it. A long time before Priest answers.
priest,She knew. He turns to THE ENGINE -- its grinning teeth grill CAVED IN as if smashed by the very hand of God.
the priestess,"Lies before it. Somehow not a scratch on her...But something's wrong -- something inside her broken, something elemental. She doesn't have much time. Priest kneels beside her, taking her hand. Trying to be strong for her."
priest,"""You shall wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow. Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit... The words are heavy, each harder than the next."
priest,"sees him but chooses to stay with the Priestess, brushing the hair from her face."
priestess,I wish we could've had more time.
priest,".Me too. She reaches up, placing her hand on his chest."
priestess,"Wherever it is we go -- we go together, right? She smiles weakly... but Priest can see she's scared. He gives her one last kiss, cradling her body, sand circling them as she draws her final breath."
hicks,"When you're finished -- You know where to find me. A tense beat then Priest GUNS the engine. Hicks and Lucy watching as he blazes towards the Cities, the sky above the color of hellfire."
priest,"Slowly makes his way down the aisle, bruised and bloodied, his very presence a direct affront to this place. A woman GASPS, somebody faints."
orelas,"Ecces Agnes Dei, ecces qui tollit peccata mundi."
black hat,"I'm afraid you're too late, Priest."
the monsignors,"Shed their robes, revealing fresh BITE MARKS on their necks. Orelas' new-found fangs glint in the candlelight."
orelas,And why shouldn't we live forever?
priest,"Stands shell shocked, the level of betrayal staggering."
priest,"Sends him sailing through the air, Black Hat crashing into a collection of CANDLE HOLDERS, an ancient TAPESTRY catching fire, flames quickly spreading to the other fabrics -- The chamber erupting in an orange blaze!"
black hat,With them I can start anew! You can't stop it --
priest,"WRENCHES himself from,Black Hat's grip, tumbling. across the floor. WHAPI The cross S LM onto Black Hat, pulverizing hi !"
koeppen,"Am I next? Priest approaches -- Koeppen closing his eyes, ready for the blow he knows is to come. But Priest only lifts the man's head, studying his neck. He's clean. And without a single word -- Priest just walks away. When Koeppen opens his eyes, he's a new man -- a man absolved. With renewed energy, he looks to the crowd around him. And for the first moment in a long time ...He believes."
hicks,Leans against the backwall watching. Lucy glances his way... then shyly looks away.
aaron,"I can't thank you enough for what you've done, sheriff."
hicks,"Just make sure she keeps on the tea. It's a special brew -- lessens the bloodthirst...something my granddad taught me. Aaron nods hopefully, squeezing his. daughter's hand."
a figure,"Stands astride a motorcycle, shadowed in the moonlight."
hicks,"It doesn't have to be like this. Priest just stands, staring. Hick's hand curls around the revolver. Priest looks to the cabin, the challenge hanging in the air"
then,"He steps from the bike, advancing towards Hicks. Hicks pulls his gun, leveling it. Priest keeps coming, the wind blowing harder as he approaches. A feeling of inevitability. Hicks stands his ground, cocking his gun."
priest,"Stares into his eyes and -- Something passes between them something so strong and personal it transcends emotion. Hicks FIRES! But Priest is pone. Hicks looks around -- There's no sign of him, not even the bike."
shit,He RACES back to the cabin...
aaron,All done.
hicks,"Nothing to worry about, just a coyote. Aaron smiles, happy enough to be with Lucy."
aaron,"Well ...we're all God's creatures. Hicks turns, ready to leave, but something on the table catches his eye"
