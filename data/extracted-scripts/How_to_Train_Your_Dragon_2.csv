Speaker,Dialogue
final draft,"May 5th, 2014"
snotlout,"Oh, I'm sorry, Fishlegs! Did you want that?"
fishlegs,"Snotlout! That's mine! Snotlout FALLS BACK toward RUFFNUT and TUFFNUT, who lag on their two-headed Zippleback, BARF & BELCH."
snotlout,"Here ya go, babe. With a chivalrous grin, Snotlout tosses the sheep to Ruffnut. She SNATCHES it with a sneer and a GRUMBLE."
ruffnut,"Come on, Barf. It's starting to stink around here. Barf starts to peel off, spewing gas. Tuffnut mocks Snotlout with a mugging grin."
tuffnut,"Nope. Still hates you. Let's blow this place, Belch! Belch ignites the gas, sparking a flashy explosion, and leaving Snotlout behind in the smoke. As they rush past the main bleachers, Ruffnut DROPS her sheep into one of five baskets suspended over a chasm at the lap crossing. Each backboard bears an image of its corresponding dragon. The Barf/Belch basket filled to the brim with sheep. Presiding over the game, STOICK turns to the frenzied crowd."
stoick,"That's nine for the Twins, Astrid lags with three, Fishlegs and Snotlout trail with NONE! Stoick eyes an empty basket at the far end, its backboard painted with an image of Toothless."
gobber,"Scared him off with the big talk, didn't ya, Stoick? WHACK! Snotlout, still smoldering from the blast, gets CLIPPED from behind. ASTRID, rolls in, astride STORMFLY -- spirited and competitive as ever, and beautiful despite herself."
astrid,"What are you doing, Snotlout?! They're going to win now!"
snotlout,"She's my princess! Whatever she wants, she gets."
astrid,Ruffnut?! Didn't she try to bury you alive?!
snotlout,"Only for a few hours! BACK TO THE RACERS, as they peel away, pouring on the speed.  HICCUP  We have custom stables... all-you- can-eat feeding stations... a full service dragon wash..."
stoick,"It's time, Gobber."
gobber,"Righty-ho!  Last lap! A HORN sounds. The racers all turn to each other, excited."
astrid,"The black sheep! Come on, Stormfly! We can still win this thing!"
ruffnut,"Come on, Barf!"
tuffnut,Let's go!
fishlegs,"Go, Meatlug! GOBBER loads the BLACK SHEEP onto a catapult."
gobber,This is your big moment. Have a nice flight!
astrid,"Up, up, up! In a flash, Fishlegs and Meatlug blur past, NABBING the sheep."
fishlegs,"Good job, Meatlug! Fishlegs tosses his captured prize to Ruffnut."
ruffnut,"Yeah! The Black Sheep! Snotlout sighs, frustrated."
astrid,You guys are fighting for Ruffnut?!
ruffnut,I'm totally winning!
fishlegs,"We're winning together! She RAMS BARF into Meatlug, sending Fishlegs into an uncontrolled SPIN. He SLAMS into Snotlout, sending their dragons TUMBLING head over tail. The crowd goes wild."
ruffnut,No one can stop me now!
tuffnut,"Except for me. We're attached, genius!"
stoick,"Get `em, Astrid!"
tuffnut ruffnut,"It's MY glory! No sheep, no You're always ruining glory! EVERYTHING! Astrid leaps off of Stormfly, runs up Belch's spindly neck, and PLUCKS the black sheep from the Twins' hands."
astrid,Gotcha!
ruffnut,Astrid!
stoick,Well played! Hahaha!  That's my future daughter-in-law!
snotlout,"Uh, excuse me."
astrid,Stormfly! Snotlout HURLS his hammer. Astrid ducks and rolls Stormfly out of the way. The hammer catches Fishlegs in the face with a CLANG. The crowd collectively winces.
stoick,"That's thirteen! Astrid takes the game! The crowd COMES UNHINGED. Astrid flies over the crowd, basking in her victory.  HICCUP  Yep. Berk is pretty much perfect. All of my hard work has paid off. And it's a good thing, too, because with Vikings on the backs of dragons, the world just got a whole lot bigger."
hiccup,"Yeah! They jackknife, heading skyward, rolling and tumbling through the ethereal cloud-scapes and joining high-flying Timberjacks as they soar in formation. Hiccup is bound head-to-toe in a snug, aerodynamic flight suit -- an asymmetrical, functional design of leather and articulated plates. It has an air of Viking bike leather."
hiccup,`Afternoon m'lady. Where have you been?
astrid,Winning races. What else? The real question is... where have YOU been?
hiccup,Avoiding my dad.
astrid,"Oh, no. What happened now?"
hiccup,"Oh, you're gonna love this. I wake up. The sun's shining. Terrible Terrors are singing on the rooftop. I saunter down to breakfast, thinking all is right with the world, and I get..."
hiccup,"Okay, first of all, I don't sound like that. What is this character? And second... what is that thing you're doing with my shoulders?"
astrid," Aw, thanks, Dad. I'm pretty impressed with myself, too."
hiccup,WHEN have I ever done that with my hands?
astrid,You just did.
hiccup,Okay... just...  Hold still. It's very serious.
astrid,"--TO MAKE YOU CHIEF! Oh, my gods!"
hiccup,You're gonna wear out the spring coil. The calibration is very sensitive!
astrid,  What did you tell him?
hiccup,"I didn't. By the time he turned around, I was gone."
astrid,"Well, it's a lot of responsibility. The map will have to wait for sure, and I'll need to fly Toothless, since you'll be too busy..."
hiccup,"It's not me, Astrid. All those speeches, and planning, and running the village... that's his thing."
astrid,"I think you're missing the point. I mean, chief. What an honor. I'd be pretty excited. Hiccup shakes his head."
hiccup,I'm not like you. You know exactly who you are. You always have. But...
astrid,"What you're searching for... isn't out there, Hiccup."
hiccup,"Maybe. But, y'know... there is something out there."
astrid,  Hiccup...
hiccup,Stay close.
astrid,Hiccup!
hiccup,Astrid! Look out!
astrid, HICCUP!
eret,Watch the tail!
hiccup, STOP!
astrid, STORMFLY!  What are you doing?
eret,Back again?
astrid,Dragon army?
hiccup,"Look, we don't want any trouble."
eret,Ha! You should've thought of that before you stole all of our dragons and blasted our fort to bits!
hiccup,Wait...
astrid,What are you talking about?
hiccup,You think we did this?
eret,"Dragon trapping is hard enough work as it is, without do-gooder dragon riders sneaking in to rescue them."
hiccup,What do-gooder -- there are other dragon riders?
eret,"You mean, other than your thieving friend from last night? You tell me."
hiccup,Drago what-fist? Does anything you say make sense?
teeny,He's expecting a new shipment of dragons for his army by tomorrow.
eret,This is what he gave me last time I showed up empty-handed. He promised to be far less understanding in the future.
hiccup,"  Just give us back our dragon, and we'll go, strange, hostile person whom we've never met."
eret,"Oh, where are my manners? I'm Eret. Son of Eret. Finest dragon trapper alive."
hiccup,And this is Toothless. He says we're going. Now.
eret,"Heh. They all say that.    RUSH `EM, LADS!"
astrid,"Stormfly! C'mon, go! Go!"
eret," YOU WILL NEVER HOLD ON TO THOSE  DRAGONS, YOU HEAR ME?! DRAGO IS  COMING FOR THEM ALL!"
stoick,Any sign of him?
gobber,"Ah, he's probably flown off the edge of the world by now. You sure you want that kid running the village? You can still delay your retirement."
stoick,"Oh, he's ready. You'll see."
gobber,Who finally decided to show up for work. Yay.
hiccup,"Sorry. Got held up.  Hey, Dad, could I have a word?"
stoick,Something you're itching to tell me?
hiccup,"Not quite the itch you're thinking of, but yes."
stoick,"Good man! Now, lesson one. A chief's first duty is to his people. So..."
hiccup,Could we just talk in private for--
starkard,"--That's me! That's me! I'm next!  I was ahead of you! Excuse me, I've been here all day!"
stoick,"Absolutely! You got it, sir!"
hiccup,"Dad, this is actually a little more important than building saddles."
stoick,"Ah-ah! Lesson two. No task is too small when it comes to serving your people. Excuse us, Grump."
gobber,Grump! You let the forge die down again!
stoick,One of these. And this...
hiccup, DAD --
stoick,-- There you go! Go on. Have away.
hiccup,"But, seriously, I really need to tell you about this new land we came across."
gobber,Another one?!
fishlegs,Any new dragons?
hiccup,We didn't stick around to find out. These folks weren't particularly friendly.
gobber,"Oh, really? Your Night Fury and Deadly Nadder didn't bring them cheering to the rooftops?"
hiccup,"No, this was different. Not the standard run-for-the-hills hoo-ha I've come to enjoy. These guys were trappers. Dragon trappers."
astrid,You should've seen their fort. All blown apart and stuck in giant spikes of ice. It was weird.
hiccup,"I've never seen anything like it. And worst of all, they thought we did it!"
gobber,"Y'know, you two are gonna get yourselves in SERIOUS trouble one of these days. Not everyone appreciates this way of life."
stoick,"Gobber's right, son. Best we keep to our own. Besides, you'll have more important uses for your time --"
hiccup,They are building a dragon army.
tuffnut,I'll bloody his fist with my face if he tries to take my dragon!
ruffnut,Or mine.
tuffnut,You're such a moron.
fishlegs,A beautiful moron.
snotlout,Yeah...
stoick,Bludvist? Drago Bludvist?
hiccup,"Uh, yeah. Wait. You know him?"
stoick, GROUND ALL DRAGONS!
hiccup,What? Why?!
hiccup,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! What is happening?"
gobber,You heard the man! Lock it down!
stoick,No DRAGON or VIKING sets foot off this island until I give the word!
hiccup,Because some guy you knew is stirring up trouble in some faraway land?
stoick,Because Drago Bludvist is a madman. Without conscience or mercy. And if he's built a dragon army... gods help us all.
hiccup,Then let's ride back out there. We'll follow those trappers to Drago and talk some sense into him.
stoick,No. We fortify the island.
hiccup,It's our duty to keep the peace!
stoick,"Peace is over, Hiccup. I must prepare you for war."
hiccup,"War? Dad, if Drago's coming for our dragons, we can't wait around for him to get here. Let's go find him and change his mind."
stoick,"Some minds won't be changed, Hiccup. Berk is what you need to worry about.   A chief protects his own."
astrid,"Hiccup, don't."
hiccup,I have to.
stoick, THIS WAY! QUICKLY!
hiccup,Come on!
stoick,Hiccup!
eret,"Keep your eyes peeled, lads! With this wind, we'll reach Drago by daybreak, so best we fill this ship up with dragons and quick! It's no time to be picky. Not if we want to keep our --"
ug,Uh... Eret?
eret, HEADS! OFF THE PORT QUARTER!
hiccup,Nope. It's your lucky day. We give up.
astrid,What are you doing?
hiccup,"Toothless, stay."
hiccup,Oops. Almost forgot. Can't have armed prisoners!
astrid,How is this a plan?
hiccup,Just what every dragon trapper needs. One end coats the blade in Monstrous Nightmare saliva. The other sprays Hideous Zippleback gas. All it takes is a spark and...
eret,Give me that!
hiccup,No game. We just want to meet Drago.
eret,Why?
hiccup,Because I'm going to change his mind about dragons.
astrid,He can be really persuasive.
hiccup,"Once you've earned his loyalty, there is nothing a dragon won't do for you."
eret,Puh! You won't be changing any minds around here.
hiccup,I can change yours. Right here. Right now.
eret,Dragon riders!
hiccup,Put me down! Snotlout! What are you doing?
snotlout,See how well I protect and provide? Ruffnut GRUMBLES at the incessant courting. A FLYING NET whizzes past her head.
tuffnut,Aggh! What is with all the nets?!
ruffnut,Hey watch it! That was close...
astrid, HOLD YOUR FIRE!
hiccup, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?!
gobber,We're here to RESCUE you!
hiccup,I DON'T NEED to be rescued!  STOICK   ENOUGH!
eret,"Well, didn't you just pick the wrong ship, eh? I am Eret, son of --"
gobber,Anyone else?
stoick,  You. Saddle up. We're going home.
hiccup,No.
stoick,Of all the irresponsible --
hiccup,-- I'm trying to protect our dragons and stop a war! How is that irresponsible?
stoick," BECAUSE WAR IS WHAT HE WANTS, SON!"
ruffnut,Stupid.
tuffnut,Good one.
stoick,"Aye. We laughed, too..."
stoick,  I... was to only one to escape.
hiccup,Maybe.
stoick,Hiccup...
hiccup,I'm still going to try.
astrid,Let's go.
stoick,NO! Lead the others back to Berk. I've had enough mutiny for one day.
ruffnut,"Ooh, I like that."
stoick,Ruffnut!
ruffnut,  Ugh! Okay!
hiccup,"Don't worry, bud. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. I promise. Toothless' ear plates perk up. He glances over his shoulder to see a disturbance in the blanket of clouds. A strange and arresting MASKED WARRIOR rises from the clouds, standing upon something unseen. Its armor and cape flap in the buffeting turbulence. The warrior eyes Toothless and Hiccup, pulling up alongside them. Hiccup senses the approaching figure in his periphery and sits up, flustered."
hiccup, HEY! YOU LEFT MY DRAGON BACK THERE!  HE CAN'T FLY ON HIS OWN! HE'LL  DROWN!
hiccup,We have to head back for my dragon!
warrior, Could it be? After all these years? How is this possible?
hiccup,"Uh, should I... should I know you?"
warrior,No. You were only a babe...
valka,... but a mother never forgets.
stoick,Boar-headed! Just like his mother! She could never stay put either.
gobber,"Ah, he's just twenty. And a Viking. I mean, could there be a worse combination? Ha! When I think of how stubborn and senseless YOU were back in the day... well, not much has changed, actually."
stoick,"You know what he's like. He won't give up, Gobber. And if Hiccup finds Drago, before we find him..."
gobber,"Bah! NOTHING can hurt Hiccup so long as that Night Fury's around. It's a Night Fury! Framed by a hole in the ice, a glistening object bobs on the surface below. Stoick squints and CIRCLES BACK, leading Skullcrusher in a DIVE toward it. Stoick SNAGS it out of the water. It's Hiccup's helmet."
stoick,"Find him, Skullcrusher. Find him."
hiccup,Hold on! Wait just a minute! Come back here!
valka,This way. Come.
hiccup,"You can't just say something like that and run off! You're my mother?! I mean, what the -- do you grasp how INSANE it sounds?!   I have questions!"
valka,Come. Quickly!
hiccup,Where have you been all this time?
hiccup,This is where you've been for twenty years?
valka,You're not upset?
hiccup,"What? No. I don't know. It's a bit much to get my head around, to be frank. It's not every day you find out your mother is some kind of crazy, feral, vigilante dragon lady."
valka,At least I'm not boring... right?
hiccup,I suppose there is that...  ... one... specific... thing...
valka,Do you like it?
hiccup,I don't have the words.
valka,Can I... ? He's beautiful!
hiccup,--I found him in the woods. He was shot down and wounded.
valka,"This Snafflefang lost his leg to one of Drago Bludvist's iron traps. This Raincutter had her wing sliced by razor netting. And this poor Hobblegrunt was blinded by a tree snare... then left to die alone and scared.  And what of this? Did Drago or his trappers do this, too?"
hiccup,"Heh. Well, crazy thing is... I'm actually the one who shot him down."
valka,What did your father think of your Night Fury friend?
hiccup,He didn't take it all that well.
valka,If only it were possible.
hiccup,"No, really, I --"
valka,"-- Believe me, I tried, as well. But people are not capable of change, Hiccup. Some of us... were just born different."
valka,Stop! You'll only make it worse!
valka,Hiccup!
stoick,"Valka, run!"
valka,Don't!
stoick,Hold on!
stoick, VALKA!
valka,  Stoick!
stoick,Valka...
valka,"You and your father nearly died that night, all because I couldn't kill a dragon."
hiccup,"Yeah, it runs in the family."
valka,"It broke my heart to stay away, but I believed you'd be safer if I did."
hiccup,How did you survive?
valka,"Oh, Cloudjumper never meant to harm me. He must've thought I belonged here..."
hiccup,"Wait, that's the ice-spitter? He's responsible for all that destruction?"
valka,He protects us. We all live under his care. And his command.
hiccup,Wow.
valka,You must be hungry.
hiccup,"Uh, yeah. I could eat."
valka,"Good. It's feeding time. Toothless tucks himself beneath Cloudjumper's wing, trying to befriend him, but Cloudjumper isn't having any of it. He grimaces and follows Valka out."
astrid,I don't like it. They should've been back with Hiccup by now.
ruffnut,I don't like it either. Eret son of Eret was the man of my dreams. My everything!
snotlout,"But, baby, I grew facial hair for you."
fishlegs,"Me, too."
astrid,What if Drago shot them down? What if they need our help?   We have to find them.
fishlegs,  What? But Stoick said...
astrid,"It doesn't matter what he said, if they've all been captured. Come on!"
eret,"We've nowhere to go! Nothing to sell! And no heads to call our own, if we don't turn up with dragons and fast --"
astrid,Careful what you wish for!
eret,What is this?!
astrid,A kidnapping.
ruffnut,Yay! Can he ride with me? Can he? Can he?
astrid,You're gonna show us the way to Drago.
eret,And help dragon riders sneak into Drago's camp? Just kill me now.
astrid,"That can be arranged. Stormfly, drop it."
eret, ALL RIGHT! OKAY! I'LL TAKE YOU TO  DRAGO!
astrid,Works every time.
hiccup,"Hey, I thought we were going to eat?"
valka," Oh, we are."
hiccup,"And from Dragon Island, I found this archipelago..."
valka,"When I'm up here, I don't even feel the cold. I just feel..."
hiccup,Free.
valka,"This is what it is to be a dragon, Hiccup."
hiccup,It's all well and good to call yourself a dragon.
valka,Incredible.
hiccup,"Well, not bad yourself."
valka,"All this time, you took after me. And where was I?   I'm so sorry, Hiccup. Can we start over? Will you give me another chance?"
hiccup,Did YOU know about this?
valka,Every dragon has its secrets.
hiccup,That sounds... amazing.
valka,What? There's no talking to Drago.
hiccup,But we have to --
valka,-- No. We must protect our own.
eret,"Agghh! Okay! I got you here, now get this thing off me!"
astrid,Never take a toy from a dragon. Don't you know anything?
eret,  Gah! Why does this keep happening to me?
astrid,What's down there?
fishlegs,"Large diameter bubbles, massive lungs, cold water deep dweller, I'm thinking class five leviathan, maybe six."
hiccup,"Meatlug! What's wrong, girl?"
drago,Drop the ropes.
snotlout,Hookfang!
ruffnut,Hey!
astrid,What are you doing?
drago, You belong to me now.
eret,"And as an added bonus, I also caught you their riders. No extra charge."
astrid,What?! Are you kidding me?!
ruffnut,But you were so perfect!
eret,"Turns out, there's a whole bunch of them out there. They --"
drago,How many?
astrid,Drago doesn't have them after all.
drago, HOW MANY?!
astrid,Hundreds! A whole island full!
eret,I wouldn't worry about it. My men are hunting them down as we speak. They won't know where you're hiding. I promise you that.
astrid,"Oh, yes they will!"
drago,-- Hiccup?
eret,He's not a problem. Really. Trust me.
astrid,He's only the son of Stoick the Vast...
drago,Dragon master? I ALONE control the dragons!
tuffnut,Nope.
fishlegs,Sorry!
astrid,"And unless you let us go, right now, he will blast through here on his Night Fury and blow your entire fleet of ships to splinters!"
ruffnut,Then they'll be crying like babies!
snotlout,Funny and beautiful.
fishlegs,"Good one, babe!"
tuffnut,Yeah. Like babies. They always cry. Real tiny ones...
drago,First there was one rider. And now all of Berk.   And YOU led them to me.
eret,Drago!
drago, CEASE ALL PREPARATIONS! WE MUST  ATTACK THE DRAGONS RIDER'S NEST AT  ONCE!    WE WILL TAKE DOWN THEIR ALPHA...  AND THEN WE WILL TAKE BERK!
eret,You're overreacting!
drago,And get rid of him.
eret,"Drago, please..."
astrid, STORMFLY!
hiccup,"  Well, bud, we can't wait around for Drago to attack this place. We've gotta find him first. Let's go."
stoick,Easy now.
hiccup,Are you kidding me? How'd you get in here?
stoick,The same way we're getting you out.
hiccup,We?
gobber,All clear!
stoick,Toothless. Come.
hiccup,Dad! There's something you need to know!
stoick,"Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way."
hiccup,"This isn't an on-the-way kind of update, actually..."
stoick,"I've heard ENOUGH, Hiccup."
hiccup,... more of the earth-shattering development variety.
stoick,"Yeah, just add it to the pile."
hiccup,"Dad, unlike most surprises I spring on you, this is one you'll like. I promise! You just have to handle it delicately, so..."
gobber,"Uh, you might want to take this one. Oh, boy."
hiccup,"Dad, can you put the sword away... please?"
valka,"  I know what you're going to say, Stoick. How could I have done this? Stayed away all of these years. And why didn't I come back to you? To our son."
gobber,This is why I never married.   This and one other reason.
valka,"  I know that I left you to raise Hiccup alone... but I thought he'd be better off without me. And I was wrong, I see that now, but..."
stoick,You're as beautiful as the day I lost you.
snotlout,Could this day get any worse?
tuffnut,"Uh, let me see. You'll jump into freezing cold water and then die from drowning."
eret,Looks refreshing.
astrid,You are a steaming heap of dragon --
eret,-- Duck.
soldier,Warn the others!
ruffnut,"Get `em, you son of an Eret!"
tuffnut,Ugh. Pathetic. You can still jump.
eret,So? Are we going to save your dragons and get out of here or not?
astrid,Meatlug?
eret,Anyone coming?
ruffnut,I don't know. You just keep doing what you're doing. Keep crankin'...
eret,Thank you for saving my life.   Now let me return the favor.
hiccup,"Mom, you'd never recognize it! Where we used to make weapons, we now build saddles, wing slings -- we even fix dragon teeth! You wouldn't believe how much everything's changed!"
stoick,"Our son's changed Berk for the better. I think we did well with this one, Val."
hiccup,"Thanks, Dad."
valka,I'm... a little out of practice.
stoick,"  Well, y'know... I didn't marry you for your cooking."
gobber, I've still got a few knocking around in here. Ha ha!
hiccup,"And once you move back in, with all of your dragons, Drago won't even stand a chance. Everything will be okay!"
stoick,"Slow down, son. It's a lot to take in."
hiccup,Oh. Gotcha.
gobber,"Oh, I love this one!"
stoick,"  Remember our song, Val?"
gobber,  Sorry.
stoick,  If you will promise me your heart...
valka,  And love me for eternity.
stoick,"  And I would keep you from all harm, if you'd stay here beside me."
valka,  I have no use for rings of gold. I care not for your poetry. I only want your hand to hold. I only want you near me.
gobber,"C'mon, Hiccup!"
gobber,  I'm still going...
hiccup,Gobber!
gobber,I'm done.
stoick,Ah... I thought I'd have to die before we'd have that dance again.
valka,No need for drastic measures.
stoick,"For you, my dear... anything."
valka,Yes!
gobber,Great! I'll do the cooking!
stoick,"Thank Odin you didn't listen to me, son. We never would have found each other. Suddenly, Toothless and Cloudjumper suddenly perk up, sensing something unheard. Hiccup notices."
hiccup,Toothless?
hiccup,"Oh, no..."
stoick,"Val! It's all right, it's all right. We're a team now.   Now what do you want to do?"
valka,We have to save the dragons.
stoick,  Aye. You got it!
drago,"Whatever comes, keep hitting the mountain! We need to draw the alpha out."
tuffnut,Surprise! Yeah!
drago, WHAT?!
astrid,You really are full of surprises.
tuffnut,Dragon Riders coming through!
drago, CUT THEM DOWN!
ruffnut,"Eret, son of Eret!"
astrid,"Up, girl! To the left, Eret! That's it! Look out!"
archer,Take `em down!
gobber,Heads up!
drago,Dragon Master.
hiccup,"Welcome aboard, dragon rider!"
eret,Thanks. I think.
astrid,Where have you been?
hiccup,"Oh, y'know. Catching up with Mom."
eret,Whoa...
astrid,That's your mother?!
hiccup,"Well, now you know where I get my dramatic flair."
drago,The alpha! Now we have a fight!
hiccup,"There! Come on, Toothless! Show them what you got, bud. Toothless dive-bombs the swatter and DESTROYS it with a plasma bolt, freeing the dragon."
drago,I've waited a long time for this!
valka,You cannot take our dragons! They are controlled by the alpha!
drago,  Then it's a good thing I brought a challenger.
hiccup,  Another one?
fishlegs, I WAS WAY OFF! THAT IS A CLASS TEN!  CLASS TEN!
valka,No. No.
drago,Come on! Take down the alpha!
valka,Thank you.
stoick,"For you, my dear... anything."
valka,"I'll do my best! Come on, Cloudjumper!"
drago,You... I watched you burn!
stoick,It takes more than a little fire to kill me!
gobber,Stoick!
valka,No!
drago,We've won.
stoick,No!
gobber,"Right behind ya, Stoick!"
hiccup,STOP! Stop!
drago,This... is the great dragon master? The son of Stoick the Vast? What shame he must feel.
hiccup,"All of this loss, and for what? To become unstoppable? To rule the world?"
drago,Or tear them apart.
hiccup,Then why a dragon army?
drago," Well, you need dragons to conquer other dragons."
hiccup,Or maybe you need dragons to conquer people.   To control those who follow you... and to get rid of those who won't.
drago,Clever boy.
hiccup,"The world wants peace. And we have the answer, back on Berk. Just let me show you."
drago,NO! Let ME show YOU.
stoick,What...?
gobber,"Okay, change of plans."
drago,"No dragon can resist the alpha's command. So he who controls the alpha, controls them all."
hiccup,"Toothless? You okay, bud? What's going on?"
drago,"Witness true strength. The strength of will over others. In the face of it, you are nothing."
hiccup,"Uh, what did he just tell you?"
stoick,Hiccup!
hiccup, STOP!
stoick, SON!
hiccup, DAD! NO!
valka,"Stoick... She helps Hiccup to turn Stoick's body over. Valka presses her ear to Stoick's heart, confirming his death with a mere glance to Hiccup. He tears up, overwhelmed."
hiccup,No... you...
valka,It's not his fault. You know that.
drago, GATHER THE MEN AND MEET AT BERK!
hiccup,"Toothless! Hiccup tries to go after Toothless, but Valka holds him back."
valka,"No, don't!"
drago,Move out!
hiccup,"I'm sorry, Dad."
valka,"You came early into this world. You were such a wee thing. So frail, so fragile. I feared you wouldn't make it."
hiccup,I was so afraid of becoming my dad. Mostly because I thought I never could. How do you become someone that great? That brave? That selfless?   A chief protects his own. We're going back.
tuffnut,"Uh, with what?"
ruffnut,He took all the dragons.
hiccup,Not all of them.
ruffnut,Fly straight!
fishlegs,I don't want to die!
tuffnut,We can't fly these things!
fishlegs,"Yeah, no kidding!"
astrid,"But won't that Bewilderbeast just take control of these guys, too?"
hiccup,They're babies. They don't listen to anyone!
tuffnut,"Yeah, just like us!"
gobber,This... is... very dangerous!
hiccup,"Well, it's a good thing that I never listen."
gobber,So what IS your plan?!
hiccup,Get Toothless back and kick Drago's-
gobber,Heads up!
hiccup,And that thing.
hoark,"Ah, that's a good boy!"
drago,Your chief is dead.
hiccup,No...
fishlegs,He took all the dragons!
hiccup,  Distract the alpha. Try to keep his focus off of Toothless.
tuffnut,Uh... how?
eret,Have you forgotten who you're riding with?
snotlout,Amateur.
drago,What?
ruffnut,Keep `em coming!
snotlout,"Black sheep, baby!"
fishlegs,I'm okay!
drago,You certainly are hard to get rid of. I'll say that.
hiccup,"Toothless? It's me, bud. It's me. I'm right here. Come back to me."
drago,He is not yours anymore. He belongs to the alpha!
hiccup,"It wasn't your fault, bud. They made you do it."
drago,How are you doing that?
hiccup,"Please. You are my best friend, bud."
drago,No!
hiccup,Yeah!
drago,Do something!
hiccup,We need to get those two apart.
astrid,"Take them down, babe!"
valka,Go get `em.
drago,Take control of it!
hiccup,"Shut it out, Toothless!"
drago, STOP THEM!
hiccup, NOW!
drago,Agghh!
hiccup,Hold him there Toothless!
drago,  Or is it?
hiccup,"Oh, no!"
valka,No! No...
hiccup,He's challenging the alpha!
valka,"To protect you. The Bewilderbeast ROARS at this act of insubordination. Toothless fires back, time and again, fully in control."
drago,"No, no, no, no! Fight back! Fight!  FIGHT!"
hiccup,Now do you get it? This is what it is to earn a dragon's loyalty.   Let this end now.
drago,Never! Come on!
hiccup,The alpha protects them all.
astrid,Stormfly!
gobber,"Oh, give me a cuddle, Grumpy!"
fishlegs,Who's my little princess?
snotlout,"Don't you ever leave again, Hookfang!"
ruffnut,Oh Barf!
eret,That was some pretty fine dragon wrangling back there. You'd make a good trapper.
hiccup,"Y'know, Skullcrusher's gonna need somebody to look after him now."
eret,Me?
valka,Your father... he'd be every bit as proud as I am.
hiccup,"Thank you. I'm really glad you're here, Mom."
valka,And here I'll stay.
astrid,See? I told you it was in here.
hiccup,"Ha, ha. Still doing that one? That's hilarious.   Come here, you."
gobber,Ooh.
