Speaker,Dialogue
jolie," All my life, my parents have told me I'm smart and talented. That I can be anything I wanna be when I grow up. Getting into the West Branch Magnet Program was supposed to be some kinda honor. They probly thought I'd grow up to be a doctor, or a lawyer, or scientist that cures cancer and junk. I mean for me school has always been a breeze."
jolie," But when I look around, I just feel surrounded by dorks."
jolie," All I want, is to be like the kids on varisty, who live in the Maple Ave towers."
jolie," The maple ave kids are coming up from nothing. I mean, their only shot at college is balling. And they've got girls blowing up their pagers twenty-four seven."
jolie, I pray to God I make varsity. I'd do anything to be like the Maple Ave. kids.
coach,That was terrible.
henrietta,Do you think you're gonna make varsity?
henrietta,School is so wack.
jolie,I support you no matter what. But I can't be changin' no diapers.
jolie," I've been fucking Henrietta for a while. She's the best. She's pregnant with someone else's baby but I'm cool with that. In fact, I think that's why I like her so much. She's kinda thugged out."
jolie,Your stomach's smooth.
henrietta,Not now Jolie.
jolie,I think you look more beautiful like this than anything. I wish you could be this way forever. We'd be so happy like this.
jolie,I love you.
jolie,"Hey, Mr. Aaronson."
jolie,You got my check?
jolie,I guess.
jolie," Henrietta's adopted. She lives in a big house like me. Her parents pay me to tutor her in geometry. She's kind of an outcast. I think that's why we click. Plus, our moms both work for the same law firm. They fly all over the country doing somethin'."
jolie," Uh, I don't know. Maybe."
jolie, ...you know... Geometry's a hard thing. Algebra leads to it and if you dont get that then-
jolie,Yea.
jolie,Thanks.
jolie, My great great grandfather was a famous black face performer.
jolie,They used to call him the greatest performer of all time. But now. Kids at school have never even heard of him. I mean not even magnet kids in AP history have heard of him.
haroon,"Hey, can I be excused for the Million Man March?"
jolie,"Hey, can I use the bathroom?"
haroon,"Dude, don't they post who made the team today?"
jolie,"Naw, not till Monday they said."
haroon,"Alright man, have a good day at school."
jolie,Yeah right.
haroon,See ya.
jolie,Lucky bastards.
jolie, This sucks. All the minorities get an excused absence for the Million Man March.
jolie," But me, I'm stuck in school like a bama."
jolie, I wish I was one of them. I wish I was one of them. I wish I was one of them. Fuck.
jolie, I'm supposed to tutor Henrietta every Sunday. She's getting an F in math. She knows how to do it though. She's flunking on purpose.
jolie, She's so gangster.
haroon,Hey you heard Fransisco got arrested?
fransisco,"I'm innocent, this is bull shit!"
haroon,Over some pictures on the Internet.
haroon, Yea.
haroon,Yo dont forget I need my computer homework back by Monday.
jolie,I got you. Dont forget to get me my bio homework back.
haroon,Yea duh.
jolie," My great great grandfather had a song, Hallelujah I'm a Bum. Tupac had a song, I'd Rather Be an N.I.G.G.A., so we can get drunk and smoke weed all day. I always thought they were really similar."
haroon,"Yo. I gotta take a massive dump, will you guard the door while I'm in there."
jolie,Yea.
haroon,I'm taking the most epic shit. Oh! Dude! Don't they post who made the team today?
haroon,Don't forget I need my computer homework back? Jolie!?
jolie, As a white boy at West Branch I'm just not cool.
jolie, But making the team would change my life forever.
jolie, It's my one shot to fit in with the Maple Ave kids. To actually be somebody!
jolie," Making the team, felt like the most important thing in my life."
jolie," As a white boy I just didn't fit in, not in Takoma Park. But now..."
jolie, I was practically black.
jolie, I even ditched class to work on my hops.
haroon,"Man, I can't believe you made the team."
jolie,I was the last bama on the list! If Francisco hadn't been arrested I'd still be a loser! I'd be just another Joe Shmoe Lame-oh geek in the Blair High School Magnet.
jolie,"Oh hey, can your mom give you a ride home later. There's something I gotta do."
haroon,Oh... Yeah. Yeah. That's cool.
haroon,Yeah.
jolie, Tupac. Biggie. Snoop Dog. Easy-E. Dr. Dre. Suge Knight. Mr. T.
jolie's dad,Alright bye. No injuries.
jolie,"Alright, bye Dad."
jolie's dad,"Hey, you back from the hill? What happened?"
henrietta,"It smells like dog shit in these woods, Jolie. Why'd you want to meet out here anyway?"
jolie,Wow. That is pretty bad. It smells like a dead mouse or something.
henrietta,You dont want to be seen with me do you? Cus I'm pregnant.
jolie,...what? No.
henrietta,You wanna make out with me?
jolie,"Yea but, I can't. Not no more. We can't be hanging out any more. You understand though right?"
henrietta,...Why?
jolie,"Henrietta, I told you. I made the basketball team. I'm a Blazer now."
jolie,L...
jolie,Do you need a token for the bus or some junk?
jolie," I felt bad but,"
jolie, I guess.
arius,Now it comes with two free controllers and the game.
jolie, Oh yeah.
arius,Yeah. We were playing that joint at my place and one of the cheerleaders was all confessing how cute she thinks you are.
jolie, Which one?
arius, Christine Ortanyez.
coach dale,Jolie!
haroon,"Come on man, we've gotta nail the Marion Barry skit tomorrow or I'm gonna get a B in English."
jolie,I don't feel like it. I told you.
haroon,"Dude, it's was just a preseason game, come on."
jolie,"Man, if I can't get in when we're up thirty in the preseason then I'm never gonna play."
haroon,He tried to put you in the game.
jolie,"Yeah, for thirty seconds."
elliott,Three. Two.  One.
elliott,"Come on, Haroon. Let's get you home."
jolie,Already?
haroon,"Elliott, will you go over this skit with me. I think you'll really like it and I need to practice or I'm gonna get a B in..."
henrietta,I knew you'd be back.
jolie,Because you know I love you.
henrietta,Whatever.
jolie,What?
jolie,You're the best. I love you forever Henrietta.
henrietta,You promise.
jolie,I promise to God.
henrietta,Are you gonna help take care of my baby?
jolie,I'd do anything for you.
henrietta,"Wait. I want you to know... There's some stuff. I feel like you're the only one I can trust, the only one I can talk too. Like about when I ran away, and let those kids take photos of me. I couldn't tell anyone but you. You know that right?"
jolie,I know. They were just photos. Everyone makes mistakes.
henrietta, Jolie's stupid. He'll believe anything. But I like him. I've been failing algebra just so he can tutoring me.
christine,Hey Jolie. Have you seen this article?
jolie,What? No. Lemme see.
jolie,Wow. I heard Francisco got arrested but I didn't know he made the paper.
christine,I heard he got arrested because him and a bunch of other kids banged that pregnant girl Henrietta for a dollar or something.
christine,"Each, I hope."
jolie," That's a rumor, duh. They just took photos."
christine,How do you know? Were you there?
jolie,I heard.
arius,Jolie. I heard your old girl is a straight chicken-head.
jolie,Who?
arius,You haven't heard?
arius,Heard what?
arius,That Maple Ave shit. You haven't seen the porn video with your girl Henrietta?
jolie,I'm not with that girl man. I just tutor her in Algebra.
arius,Chill brother. I'm just saying...
arius,You can take the niggas out the ghetto but you can't take the ghetto out the niggas.
christine,"Jolie, aren't you headed to computer class?"
jolie,What? Yeah.
christine,Is everything alright? You look kind of stunned or something.
jolie,What? No. I just. The sun was in my eyes.
christine,Oh.
jolie,What's up?
christine,"I am totally struggling with my program this month, do you think I could look at your code?"
jolie,My programming skills aren't that good. But we can copy Haroon's code and just change the variable names.
christine,Really?
jolie,Yea.
christine,Cool. Thanks.
henrietta,"Hey, can I bum a cigarette?"
henrietta,Whatever.
henrietta,Thanks.
henrietta,Yea. I guess so.
haroon,"Dude, Christine's been jocking your nuts lately. What's up with that?"
jolie,I don't know man. I think she's into me.
anya,She's probably just using you for my code.
haroon,It happens to me all the time.
anya,You wish.
haroon,"Even if she does like you dude, you'd have to be loco to get with her."
haroon, Has been having sex since junior high.
vlad,That's nothing. Ray's been suspended three times. They found a gun in his locker. And he has no blood parents. You don't want that kind of sloppy seconds. It's big trouble.
jolie,Hmmm.
vlad,"You would be the man, though. I'd give you that."
haroon,"Yea, that's true. You would be the man."
anya,Why? What does that have to do with anything?
christine,"You guys have the late practice today, huh?"
jolie,Yeah.
christine,Well Coach Dale asked me to tape the next game - you wanna see the camera we're using? It's in the small gym.
jolie,Oh yeah. All the way past C hall.
christine,Come on. I know a short cut through parenting class.
jolie,Through parenting class? Let's just go the long way.
christine,"Come on. Don't be such a goody goody. The teacher doesn't care. Trust me. She's like a hundred years old, she gets it. It's just an excuse to have free baby sitters for all the teen moms. And that's a good thing."
christine,Are you friends with her? That's the girl I was telling you about.
jolie,"I just tutor her in Algebra. You know how we need community service hours to graduate, well..."
jolie,It's hot as a mug in here.
christine,Stand in front of this. God that feels good.
christine,The camera's under here. Come on.
jolie, The season hadn't even started and my life had changed forever.
jolie," I swear, exactly when we kissed someone yelled score."
ray,Shut your hole!
jolie, It felt like a million bucks.
jolie," I felt guilty cuz of Henrietta, but as Tu Pac says, ""Only God can judge me."""
jolie," I did wonder if Henrietta's Dad, Mr. Aaronson, even knew she was pregnant."
jolie, But for some reason it just never came up.
haroon, Would someone please stop messing around and put the lights on. This league is for serious players only.
ray,"Boom! Step aside, nigga."
haroon," Oww, man. I think you broke my wrist."
ray,Tell your boy Jolie to lay off my girl Christine. Every time he makes a move on her I'm gonna eat your ass for lunch.
haroon, What? Why me?
zeke,"Hey, are there anymore Handi-Snacks or did you take the last one?"
haroon,"Dude, before I show you this internet stuff at my Mom's place we gotta talk about this Raymond situation. Ray said he's gonna eat my ass for lunch every time you mess with Christine."
jolie,Yea he's just afraid to step to me directly because he knows varsity has my back. Don't stress though. He's just a bully.
haroon,Don't stress? He broke my arm man. How is anything under control?
jolie,Ray is just a bully. All you have to do is hold your ground a little probably.
jolie,He'll back off.
haroon,What? Are you serious? He blind sided me. How am I supposed to hold my ground?
jolie,"Come on dude, isn't that why you always carry that Batman figure around?"
haroon,What?
jolie,Because Batman's the only superhero that is just a regular guy.
haroon,Batman is a cartoon. This TOY is for inspiration. We're talking about real life. Are you loco?
jolie,"Fine, then just stay close to me and the team will get your back, I swear."
haroon,Pinky swear. No leaving me behind at lunch now that you're all tight with the team or nothing.
jolie,Done.
haroon,Cool. Now let's conquor titen again. I think we can break the high score.
zeke,Seriously.
wendel,What's up?
jolie,Hey.
arius,What's up Jolie.
jolie,What's up?
merly,What's up? What's up with you?
jolie,What's up?
codroy,What's up?
jolie,What's up?
surgio,Chillen.
wendel,"Peace, nigger."
jolie,See man. Ray can't mess with us now. We're rolling too deep.
haroon," Yea. I guess your right. Junior year's actually gonna be cool. And I love spirit week. Merly, did you bring a hat for hat day?"
merly,Yea.
merly,"Hey, Jolie. Want to give us a lift to Taco Bell for lunch?"
jolie,Yea. No prob.
haroon,Cool man.
merly,You want my spot?
haroon,Ummm. Naw. Naw. I'm cool.
merly,You sure?
jolie,Jump in the trunk dude. It's not far.
haroon,You think so?
merly,That's rediculous. Let's just bring you back something? What do you want?
haroon,Uh. Just like a couple burritos. Here's a ten?
merly,No worries. I got you.
haroon,Oh thanks man.
merly,No prob.
jolie,I'll bring you some cinnamon twists too!
merly,The cops just followed us from the left turn only lane.
arius,I knew it. Did you see his face?
merly,That dude is always messing with us.
wendel,He's still dealing nickel bags I bet.
arius,Naw man. It's because of that video. The Maple Ave thing...the one with Jolie's girl Henrietta.
jolie,She's not my girl.
arius,That's not what she said before she started sucking everyone's dicks... Don't believe me. Y'all can see the VHS.
principal ganus,Arius. This is your fifth detention this semester. That means in-school suspension for the week. Starting now.
arius,What!? Did you hear what happened to us? We got harrassed by the cops man!
jolie,Come on man. Coast is clear.
security guard,Wendel! Get your ass over hear.
wendel,What? What about Jolie?
security guard,He's in the magnet program. His teacher will handle it.
jolie," And just like that, with Marley arrested and Arius doing in-school, I might just get some playing time?"
haroon,I thought you said Ray wasn't gonna mess with me man?
jolie,Woah. Dude. Are you alright?
haroon,Do I look alright?
jolie,I'm sorry man.
haroon,That's all you got?
jolie,No. Come on man.
haroon,YOu said I just had to hold my ground.
jolie,Well at least you've still got your teeth.
haroon,You're an asshole.
jolie,"Let me get you back. Come to the movies with me tonight dude. The new Ice Tea flick is out. The tickets on me. Coke, popcorn, the whole nine."
haroon,The whole nine? It's a movie.
jolie,It's an Ice Tea flick and it's gonna be tight as a mug.
jolie,We had an early game today against Paint Branch. And I scored 3 points.
henrietta,You know I saw you with that Cheerleader.
jolie,Come on. Enough with that. I washed my hands already. So I can please you.
henrietta,Just tell me yall are hooking up. It's OK if you are. I just want the truth.
jolie,You want the truth. How is this?
henrietta, Yeah. Francisco got arrested. What about it?
jolie,I thought you said you didn't fuck any of them.
henrietta,I didn't.
jolie,Did you suck their dicks?
henrietta,Jolie. It's none of your fucking business.
jolie,Well everyone at school says you did. And now they're saying there's a video and that's why Francisco and Merly got arrested.
henrietta,They're not arrested. They got questioned and shit and then they got suspended.
jolie,How do you know?
henrietta,Because I hear all the Maple Ave stuff.
haroon,Shhh. It's getting good you know.
henrietta,"Look, that's all beside the point. Whatever you heard about me at school, they don't know shit. It's a lie. I already told you. I ran away from home. That's it. Now leave me alone."
jolie,Why did you let them take pictures?
henrietta,I told you. I needed money.
jolie,For what?
henrietta,"Duh, an abortion. Does that make you feel better. But I decided I want this baby Jolie. I want a real family. So I went to Pizza Hut for dinner instead. The one on University Boulevard, do you want a receipt or something?"
jolie,Where did you sleep that night?
henrietta,I told you. I slept at the ATM machine. Now stop it.
jolie,Dang. I know. I'm sorry. I'm such an idiot.
henrietta,But I love you. I just want to be with you now. And put all that in the past.
jolie,Why didn't you come to me then?
henrietta,We had just met.
jolie,"I know. Damn it. You could have slept on my couch, easy. My parents wouldn't have even cared."
henrietta,Jolie. No.
jolie,You lied to me.
henrietta,I didn't. I would never.
jolie,How do I know?
henrietta,Don't you trust me?
anonomous man, Don't mess with his boy? You're gonna get it now! Un-hun!
jolie,Haroon and I better get going. We gotta finish our Magnet project for R&E.
henrietta,"Jolie, my Dad is picking us up. I thought you were gonna help me study?"
jolie,I would but I can't. This is like the biggest project of the year.
henrietta,I have a huge test tomorrow and if I don't pass this class I have to go to summer school.
jolie,I know but Mr. Donaldson just assigned a huge thing-
henrietta,Haroon. Would you mind letting me talk to Jolie in private?
henrietta,"The only time we go out is to the movies, and you're always late, and it's always the late show."
jolie,What are you talking about?
henrietta,Jolie. I saw Christine was all over you at school.
jolie,She's just like that. She's a cheerleader.
henrietta,Tell me something. What do you really want to do with your life?
jolie,What do I want to do?
henrietta,Why do you repeat everything I say?
jolie,"What do I wanna do? I mean, you know that, right?"
henrietta,You're five-eight.
jolie,Spud Web was five seven.
henrietta,Jolie.
jolie,What?
henrietta,"Dad, we're fucking studying here! Do you mind?"
henrietta,"Dad, have you seen how fucking fat I am!?"
henrietta,"Dad, we all know the story of you saving kids in the ghetto, ok?"
jolie,UH-
henrietta,"Jolie's bailing, Dad. Come on."
jolie,"I'm really sorry, Mr. Aaronson, but-"
henrietta,Dad. Just drive please.
haroon,So you've been tutoring her in Algebra and that's it?
jolie,Yea.
haroon,Whatever man.
jolie,What?
haroon,I was sitting right there.
jolie,So?
haroon,So man. I saw what was going on. I'm not an idiot.
jolie,What? I thought we were gonna play street fighter?
haroon,I can play dune at home on my PC.
jolie,What are you scared I'm gonna smoke you like a blunt again?
haroon,You wish. You can't touch my skills.
jolie,I'd turn you into a straight dikfor.
haroon,What the hell is a dikfor?
jolie,You don't know what a dick's for!? You fucking homo-thug!
haroon,"Oww! Dude, you're pealing off my scab. Get off me! You know you've been a real jerk lately."
jolie,"Damn, Ray really smashed your face didn't he?"
haroon,I think you're an asshole for lying to Henrietta and Christine.
jolie,I never lied to them.
jolie, I love them both.
coach dale,Kiss! Can anyone tell me what KISS stands for?
jolie,"Uh, Keep it simple stupid."
coach dale,Why are you mumbling? Speak up.
jolie,Keep it simple stupid.
coach dale,That's right. Keep it simple stupid.
coach dale,"Ya'll screw up and say, ""But I thought...""  And everyone, no more bringing your stuff in a plastic bag. Get a real bag. Something canvas. Use an old backpack if you have to."
jolie,"Arius, man. When can I see the VHS tape you mentioned?"
arius,"What? Oh, it got erased. Didn't you hear the cops are on to the whole thing?"
jolie,"Yeah, but-"
arius,"Man, Francisco is in the papers. You haven't seen?  Come here, girl. Sit on my lap."
jolie,"Henrietta didn't really fuck any of them, did she? I mean she was just posing nude for some photos, right?"
wendel,"Well, they just paid her to do a little strip tease or whatever but things escalated."
jolie,How can it just escalate?
wendel,"How did World War 2 escalate? It just did. Someone pulled out his junk teasing her, and then she started messing around with her tongue on his balls, just laughing and stuff. And it just went from there."
jolie,"Dude? If this is a psych, you got me. OK? Just tell me the truth."
wendel,I'm not lying. I'm dead serious. You can see for yourself.
jolie,It got erased I thought.
wendel,The original did. But Arius has a copy.
arius, Booooom.
wendel,Arius!
wendel,What happened to your head man?
arius,The doctors said I was crazy so they took a little piece of my brain out.
wendel,No they didn't.
arius,Yes they did. Look.
jolie,Damn.
arius,See how soft it is?
jolie,Yeah.
arius,Come by Coach Dales office tomorrow at 3 o'clock. 
arius,Arright y'all.
haroon,B minus!? Are you serious?
haroon,Did you even read this shit?
haroon,Come on Mr. Applebaum? The whole undercover hooker bust opening in this thing is genius.
haroon,Duh. Everybody knows that. It's not an Encyclopedia. It's a story.
haroon,I think you missed the point of the story! The events were mixed up because the character is mixed up. You think I don't know -
haroon, ...fucking idiot...
haroon,"Fucking dick-face man, it's not fair!"
jolie,Shit man. I'm sorry dude. You deserved an A. It was tight as a mug.
haroon,Don't placate me asshole. You didn't even read it like you said you would.
haroon,It's just a broken arm and a couple black eye. Nothing to worry about right? Go hang with your stupid team.
arius,"Look, look, look. Look. Right here, I told you."
christine, Damn.
jolie,"Aw, man."
arius,"Hold up, I gotta rewind to the funny part."
christine,What a slut! That's that girl you tutor right?
jolie, Yea. ...Henrietta Aaronson.
arius,I told you! I told you! I told you!
arius,Shhhhhh. Shhhhh. This is it.
arius,When he grabs her tits it looks like he's assessing a race horse. He's like - lemme check out this specimen.
henrietta, He'd knock me out for the rest of my life.
arius,Pause it. Pause it. Pause it. Look. Right there. That's Francisco in the back.
christine,Coach Dale is coming. I'm serious. He's coming now.
coach dale,"No weightroom today guys, we got some studying to do. This is a copy of last years Springbrook game. Get comfortable, this could be a while."
coach dale," Girls, you are welcome to watch but please keep it down, we have our work cut out for us."
coach dale,Now what was wrong with that shot?  Jolie?
arius,He shot on the first pass of a half court set.
coach dale,Are you Jolie?
arius, Do I look like white to you?
coach dale,How does it feel?
arius,Owwww. My arm.
coach dale,How does it feel?
arius,Ah. Ah. Ah.
coach dale,Look in my eyes. How does it feel?
arius,Ahhhhhh!
coach dale,If I ever see you back away from a rebound again I'm gonna bench you for the season. You wont play one second the whole year. You got that boy?
arius,Ahhhhh!
henrietta,"Jolie, you are soaking wet. What's going on? Why did you want to meet here in the middle of the night?"
jolie,This. This tape is going on. I saw it. The whole team saw it.
jolie,You lied to me. Why?
jolie,Don't you have anything to say?! Don't you?!
henrietta,What the fuck?
jolie,How could you lie to me like this? How could you make a fool of me like this?
henrietta,How could I tell you when you never listen?
jolie,Why? Why not? I love you.
henrietta,Sometimes love is not enough.
henrietta,"I just couldn't tell you about Maple Ave., Jolie. I just couldn't let you down. Your a Magnet kid. Your smart. Your excellent at computer, math and science. You don't understand where I'm coming from. What's important to me."
jolie,I think we shouldn't see each other anymore.
henrietta,I think you're right.
jolie,You do?
henrietta, Yeah. This time I think you're actually right.
jolie,Kiss me one last time.
henrietta,I never meant any of that to happen. Things just got out of control.
jolie,I'll tell your Dad I'm not your tutor anymore.
henrietta,"Thanks. Oh, and here. I want you to have this back."
jolie,What's this?
henrietta,It's Milkshake. The 95 R&B mix you gave me at our second tutoring session.
jolie,Oh. One of those tracks isn't even out yet though.
henrietta,"Yea, I know. And some are older. It's kind of fucked up."
jolie,Just like us I guess.
henrietta,Just like everyone.
jolie,"Dude, I was thinking about getting some Tims."
haroon,So what?
jolie,So you haven't noticed all the kids on the team wear them?
christine,Duh.
haroon,"Man, with sandals you never have to tie your shoes. That's all I'm saying."
jolie,Do you have these in a size ten. And bring a what -  Size 7? Yeah size seven for Haroon.
haroon,"I told you, man, I don't want Tims. I'm a sandals guy. Like Jesus. And Muhammad."
christine,"You'd look good in them, Haroon. You should try them on. Come on. Be cool."
cashier,Anything else with that?
jolie,Mr. Aaronson.
henrietta,Dad.
jolie,We just ate. But thanks.
jolie,"Oh. Uh, Henrietta didn't tell you? I, uh, can't tutor anymore."
jolie,"No, it's just, the team. Basketball is taking up so much time now is all. Getting ready for the playoffs and everything. Honestly, I'd be so tired I wouldn't even be any good."
jolie,I could probably recommend someone. My buddy Haroon's older brother maybe.
jolie,No. I'm good. It's-.
henrietta,Dad!
christine,Wow. She really hates you or something.
jolie,What do you mean?
christine,Don't pretend like you didn't see that evil eye she gave you.
jolie,What evil eye?
christine,You know their's a rumor going around that you were hooking up with her?
jolie,Who? Henrietta?
christine,Some people even say you're still hooking up.
jolie,Henrietta Aaronson?
jolie,I tutored her in algebra. Her dad is a long time friend of the family.
christine,I was gonna say. Because she's kinda pregnant.
jolie,"I know, right. You'd have to be twisted to get down with that."
christine,Do you have a jimmy?
jolie, I never had to use a condom with Henrietta.
christine,Hurry up.
jolie,Dang. I don't see one here.
christine,What?
jolie,Well maybe we can just do it a little bit.
christine,No way.
jolie, I won't even do it. I'll just feel it.
christine, Oh.
jolie," In my head I kept thinking about dribbling a basketball down an endless basketball court, playing point guard in the biggest game of the year. The Springbrook game."
jolie, That kept me focused so I wouldn't bust in about two seconds.
jolie, I was gonna pull out but...
jolie,"Uh, I better not keep going."
christine, Oh. Fuck.
christine,Have any music we can listen to?
jolie,Yea.
christine,Do you ever wish you were Tu Pac?
jolie,No. Do you?
christine,Actually yeah. Sometimes.
jolie,"Really? Shit, so do I. All the time."
christine,I can't believe he shot those drunk cops and then the cops' guns turned out to be-
christine,Yeah. So cool right.
jolie,So SO cool.
jolie," As the season rolled on, the Taco Hut became the spot to be. Some days I would just look around and soak it in. I couldn't believe I was even here."
arius,That looks like one of them locks you can just bust with your hands.
wendel,"I don't think so. The rack thing's not, like, stuck down."
arius,Arright ch'all.
christine, Jolie. I have to tell you something. Wanna go outside for a sec?
jolie, Sure.
ray,Dead man.
arius,You're not gonna do shit.
ray,This aint about you.
arius,Man just chill out.
ray,Fuck you.
arius,You're just rude. That's why your Mom beat your ass growing up.
ray,Keep talking about my Mom nigga. I'll smash your fucking nigga lips in.
arius,Say it again.
arius,My fucking gut. I'm bleeding all over my fucking Guess. My Guess shit man!
ray,Ah fuck man. I'm OK. I think I'm OK.
arius,"Ah shit, man! Ahhh! My fucking gut is burning!"
jolie,Holly shit. You need help. Someone call an ambulance.
haroon,Whoa dude. That is a lot of blood. Where is he going?
jolie,I dunno.
principal ganus,An ambulance is on the way.
wendel,Who's house?
whole team,OUR HOUSE!
wendel,Who's house?
whole team,OUR HOUSE!
wendel,Who's house?
whole team,OUR HOUSE!
coach dale,"OK, starting five. Let's go."
coach dale,"OK, we're gonna come out in a twenty-two going black on made buckets. Wendel and Jolie up front."
coach dale,Defense on three.
wendel,Defense on three. One! Two! Three!
announcer,"Starting at point guard. Number twenty two. Joel ""Jolie"" Jolson."
coach dale,Jolie! Get back in the game! Take Pistol.
jolie,Who you got?
elliott,That was a great move you made. You would have been on the line for two if that guy didn't injure you.
jolie,Owwwww! My thumb. Sharp pain just shot all the way threw my neck.
elliott,Are you alright?
jolie,Yeah.
elliott,More ravioli or anything. I could microwave some more.
jolie,"No, I'm good."
henrietta,I don't care if I go to Summer School!
henrietta,This shit is meaningless! Who gives a crap!?
step-mom, Did Henrietta just break my grandmother's China?
elliott,The Aaronsons? At this hour? Should I get it?
jolie,I don't know?
elliott, Hello.
elliott,They think only you can talk her off the ledge.
jolie,Why me?
elliott,That's what she said.
jolie,Really? Dang.
elliott,Well she's not literally on a ledge. Figuratively. Do you know what figuratively means?
jolie,"Duh. Come on, Dad. Just drive."
jolie,"Don't worry, I know how to help Henrietta get her shit together."
elliott,Jolie.
jolie,Dad. Come on. You know what I mean.
jolie,"Henrietta, your Dad showed me the test. It was bad, but if you get an A on your last exam you'll still pass."
henrietta,You really think I don't know how to do that shit?
jolie,What?
henrietta,That test isn't why I was so mad.
jolie,What is it then? You can talk to me. You can tell me anything.
henrietta,I wasn't invited with you guys to the Tyson fight tomorrow. The one on pay TV. I heard everyone was going and I just flipped out. I mean what's the deal?
jolie,What? You mean the Bowe fight?
henrietta,"Yeah. Bowe, Tyson, whatever. The point is the whole team's going."
jolie,Yeah. It's pretty much just a team thing though.
henrietta,"No it's not. Wendel, Arius, and Codroy are all bringing girls."
jolie,"Oh. I didn't know that. Well, why don't I just call you when I figure out what time we're going."
henrietta,"Well the fight is at eight, right?"
jolie,Is it?
henrietta,Yeah. And everyone's going to Muhammad Ali's Rotiserie Chicken at City Place.
jolie,Oh.
henrietta,Yeah.
jolie,"Well, I don't know. You have a lot of studying."
jolie,Cliff Livingston. I forgot about that guy.
jolie,Henrietta. Come on? We're not together anymore.
henrietta," You know Spud Web only gets a roster spot because he's a circus freak. He shouldn't be there, and that's why he sells tickets. Don't you get it. He's not good, he's just a draw. Is that what you want to be, a circus freak?"
jolie,He won the dunk contest. The guy's a beast. You're way out of your league.
henrietta,"The league is about making money. Jolie, the only reason you even got on varsity is because your Dad paid for the new uniforms. You never would have made it even with Francisco getting arrested. Don't you realize that?"
jolie,No he didn't.
henrietta,Yes he did. They cost over two thousand dollars. How could you not know that? I mean you made Varsity at Blair after being cut from JV last year. When have you ever seen that happen?
jolie,That's not true. Where did you hear that?
henrietta,My Dad talking to your dad on the phone in the kitchen.
henrietta,"I still love you, though. None of that matters to me."
henrietta,"Dad, we're studying here! Do you mind?"
jolie," It must have been good for Henrietta too, because afterwords, she didn't mention joining the team to the Bowe fight, she didn't mention Christine, she didnt mention nothing."
jolie," Still though, I was worried she'd show anyway. If she did, I didn't know what I was gonna do."
haroon,So she was just pissed because you didn't invite her to this?
jolie,Yeah.
haroon,But it sounds like she was really freaking out. I mean you said she smashed their PC.
jolie,"Yeah, when I first got there she didn't even have any clothes on. "
haroon,I don't know. I mean maybe something more is going on?
jolie,Yeah - the need for something.
haroon,You wear a condom right?
jolie,I don't have to. She's pregnant.
haroon,Ah man. Ah man. That is crazy.
haroon, Have you ever been here?
jolie, Not for a fight?
christine,Hey.
jolie,Hey.
christine,Did you see those guys who killed Jordan's Dad got life?
jolie,Yeah. I did.
christine,"They said, if only they had seen the license plate, Airness. They --"
haroon,"Dude, my dad just 911-ed me."
jolie,"When did you get a pager?! That is tight, dude."
haroon,Last week. You just haven't been around that much.
wendel,A sucker move.
fight kid 1,"You ripped my Polo shit, motherfucker! You ripped my Polo shit!"
fight kid 2,"You scratched my face, nigger!"
jolie," Strangely Henrietta never showed. I should have been relieved, but instead I felt awful. It was like yesterday we were in love and today she didn't even care I was with Christine."
coach dale, This is what it all comes down to.
coach dale, This is where we find out what we're made of.
coach dale," What we have trained for, not just this season, but for you seniors, the last four years."
coach dale, Is it unfair that we drew Springbrook in the first round? Yes. Random seeding is only because the sorry white schools complained to the school board about always losing in the first round. When I was younger the regular season meant something around here.
assistant coach,"He's such a goof ball, man. This is the playoffs. Where is he at?! Who's seen Jolie?!"
jolie,"Ms. Bart. I know you're the cheerleading coach and all, but this really better be important. I'm supposed to be in the weight- room by now."
cheerleading coach,"You're injured. And like I said, this is more important than any basketball game. This is life or death Jolie."
jolie,Christine?
christine,Jolie. I haven't had my period in three months.
jolie,"Well, maybe you should get one of those things and check it out."
christine,A pregnancy test?
jolie,Yeah.
christine,I did.  I'm pregnant with your baby.
jolie,No worries. My Dad will let me put it on his credit card. Trust me.
christine,Oh God. I'm sorry.
jolie,"No. It's not your fault. I gotta run though. Let's talk about this after the game, OK? The team needs me."
christine,What for? You're injured anyway.
jolie,I'm ok though. I can play through it. do you understand. I just gotta do this?
christine,What? I just told you I'm pregnant with your baby. Doesn't that mean anything.
jolie,Tonight I'm gonna play for you and our baby.
assistant coach,Jolie! Where the hell have you been!?
jolie,"I got stuck with no toilet paper, coach."
assistant coach,Damn man. This is the biggest game of the year.
jolie,I know. It wasn't my fault. I gotta be light on my feet.
assistant coach,You make me sick.
coach dale,Bring it in.
jolie,My hand is all better. Look.
wendel,Let's go baby! Bring it in.
teammates,"Hail Mary Full of Grace, the lord is with you, blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen."
arius,Domination baby! Domination!
jolie," That night. I never played. None of us did. Because there never was a game. Before the opening tip even kicked it off a fight between schools broke out in the crowd. Some fired a gun twice, and all hell broke loose."
elliott,"Jolie, are you OK?"
jolie,Yeah. Was that gun shots?
elliott,I don't know. Stay down just in case.
black girl,We won! We won! We won!
principal ganus,What the hell is going on out there?
jolie,OJ Simpson....not guilt.
ray,You're dead.
principal ganus,"Look who you're stepping to, Ray. A little white boy?"
principal ganus, Jolie. Come with me.
principal ganus,Look. I'm not proud of what happened in that gym.
principal ganus,Everyone who was caught fighting is being suspended for a minimum of three days. And that includes most of the team. But a suspension for you would only tarnish the reputation of the Magnet program. So...
principal ganus,"You're going to do this school a favor,  at the international math meet."
principal ganus,"You were great your freshman year. Your calculus teacher tells me your still great, but for some reason you quit."
jolie,I made JV that year.
principal ganus,"Well, there's going to be no rematch of the Springbrook playoff game. Both teams are forfeiting. So now you've got plenty of time, that's for damn sure."
jolie,They're not rescheduling our game? That's insane.
principal ganus,The math team needs you Jolie. We're on the verge of nationals. 
principal ganus,You can go now.
principal ganus,"Oh, one more thing. You will also join the team for an additional 40 hours of community service, as part of the new ""Adopt a Highway"" Program. It's part of the team punishment."
jolie,It's not fair man. I mean everyone got suspended on the team but me. Just because I'm in the Magnet.
haroon,Wake up dude. Life's not fair. Who ever said it was.
jolie,Are you sure you wanna do that? We're in the middle of C hall.
haroon,I told you. I don't give a fuck.
jolie,Really? On Mr. Applebaum's door? Yall have been warring. He's gonna know it was you.
haroon,So what?
haroon,I know. Duh.
jolie,You could get suspended for that.
haroon,Who cares? What does school even matter?
jolie,What's gotten into you?
haroon,I don't know.  Maybe my parents are getting divorced and you don't even know about it.
jolie,Are you serious?
haroon,Gimmie my spray-paint! Owww. Fuck you.
jolie,It's for your own good. This car belongs to Principal Ganus.
haroon,"I swear, of all the things you have to worry about."
jolie,What's that supposed to mean.
haroon,Come on dude.
jolie,Come on what?
haroon,Are you numb? The whole school knows Christine is pregnant with your baby.
jolie,Dude. It's not like that. She's gonna get an abortion. She comes from a wealthy family.
haroon,So what if she does. Doesn't it mean anything to you?
jolie,I don't know. I don't know what it means. It just happened.
haroon,Magic marker? That is so lame. Don't get me started.
jolie," I told them all it was Haroon who spray-painted `Free Mike Tyson,' and even he was cool too."
jolie, We even smoked a blunt. It was our first time gettng blazed and drunk.
johnny carson, What's he saying now? What's he signing?
guest," He wants to say he loves you all, and he wishes he could hang onto these people a little longer, connect with them a little deeper, before it's all over."
christine, Jolie! No way. Not until you know what.
jolie, Don't worry.
christine," When? You've been saying you're gonna get your Dad's credit card for like a month. Time is of the essence here, duh."
jolie," I told you I'm on it. First thing when my parents get back. But this is the best time to do it because we dont have to wear a condom. Come on, let's go upstairs. Trust me."
christine," No means no, Jolie."
haroon," Dude. I am blazed out of my mind right now, but I think someone's hiding in your shower?"
jolie, Forreal?
haroon," Yeah, dude. Check it."
jolie,Who's there?
henrietta,Jolie.
jolie,Damn Henrietta. You scared the shit out of me.
henrietta,How could you?
jolie,What? What are you doing in my basement bathroom?
henrietta,I'm catching you cheating with Christine! You asshole!
jolie,Shhh. People are sleeping.
henrietta,Don't lie to me. You think I dont know shit. She's pregnant with your baby.
jolie,Whao.
henrietta,You think the Maple Ave. kids don't hear mad junk about the Magnet kids.
jolie,"Henrietta, relax."
henrietta,"I know about all that stuff, how y'all hooked up during floor hockey intramurals under the trampoline. Everything. You think I don't have friends? I have friends!"
jolie,"Come on, I know you have friends Henrietta."
henrietta,You think I'm a fool? I watched you make out with her on the Power-pad two second ago!
christine,"All this time you've been hooking up with some pregnant girl failing out of school. I am so fucking humiliated right now. Don't you ever, ever, ever so much as speak to me again. Come on girls."
wendel,"Damn Jolie, all the girls just bounced."
arius,"Yea, let's get out of here."
haroon,Damn man. I better go too. This shit is too fucked up right now.
jolie, The next day I found out Christine had the abortion on her own. She said she asked the doctor to see the fetus.
jolie," The doctor said she wasn't supposed to showed it, but did anyway."
jolie, Christine said the dead fetus looked like a baby squirrel. Like the ones that fall out of the nest and are on the sidewalk dead with no fur yet. I guess it went well though.
jolie," After that Arius said not to worry about anything. That Christine would be cool, and Henrietta was just fucked up anyway."
jolie, He even invited me back to his place. It was the first time I had ever been to Maple ave.
jolie, Everybody played this ghetto version of Jin Rummy called `Tunk.'
wendel,"Jolie, you want in?"
jolie,Naw. I gotta see this.
arius,Ok. Here it goes.
jolie,Wow.
arius,Yeah. This is the future right here.
jolie,Why wont it go play or whatever?
arius,Bandwidth.
jolie, Oh yea.
cute girl,Arius. Who was the first president of the United States?
arius,"Uh, George Washington."
arius,So. That's what it's all about. I'm a capital venturist man. Internet porn is the future of sexual healing. Henrietta was just the first of many. It's big business. Dollar bills man.
jolie," I wasn't sure what to make of it all. Why Henrietta's parents never know she was pregant until too late? Or why I never said something myself? It was like none of it really mattered, or was even real at all, until it was too late."
jolie," After that I used the internet to find a bunch of places that would take Henrietta's baby up for adoption. It wasn't easy, but I found all the information right from Haroon's basement, using Netscape."
haroon,This couple looks good.
jolie,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're perfect. All I have to do is convince Henrietta."
haroon,Are you guys still on good terms?
jolie,I don't know. Our sessions are in the kitchen now.
adreseis,We got the trampoline set-up. Come on.
jolie," It's weird, I don't really care if I make the NBA anymore."
haroon,Really? What do you care about then?
jolie,I don't know.
haroon's dad,"Good one, Adreseis!!"
haroon's dad,I've made some grill cheeses! Come and get it!
haroon,Sweet! Now that Mom moved out we always eat American. You wanna eat with us?
jolie,I do but there's something I gotta do.
haroon,"Oh yeah. That's right.   Well, good luck with it all."
henrietta,Oh yeah. Let him in.
jolie,Hey. What's up? Uh. I brought over my Super Nintendo. I thought the baby might want it.
henrietta,Did Jaguar 64 finally come out?
jolie,No. Come on. I'm just trying to show you I actually care.
jolie,And I brought this too.
henrietta,Your practice Jersey!
jolie,Yeah. I'm not gonna need it anymore so.
henrietta,Really? Why not?
jolie,I'm not playing next year. I want to focus on my studies.
henrietta,"Jolie. Thank you.  It smells like you. Someday little Benny will wear it. That's what I've decided to name him, Benny."
jolie,"Oh. Wow. Well. Uh, before you name him, I was kinda thinking maybe we could discuss, uh,"
henrietta,What?
jolie,"Well, "
henrietta,"Jolie. How could you even say that? I've wanted a family of my own, a real family, since as long as I can remember. There is no way I could ever give little Benny away. Ever. In a million years. Do you understand that?"
jolie,"Well. Yeah. I guess so. But at the same time, it just doesn't seem like the smartest thing. I've already found a really wealthy, well educated, good meaning couple who'd like to meet up with you about it."
henrietta,Never. No way Jolie. End of discussion.
jolie,"Don't you even want to think it over for a few days? I mean, look how lucky your parents are to have you. You'd be making some couple just as happy. And your child would have more opportunities. I mean you're still in High School, know what I mean?"
henrietta,"Jolie, I can't even believe you're suggesting that? Dont you see how racist that is?"
jolie,What?
henrietta,Now do something to cheer me up. I am totally offended you wanted to give away my baby.
