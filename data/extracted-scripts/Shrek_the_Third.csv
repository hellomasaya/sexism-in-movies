Speaker,Dialogue
prince charming,"Onward Chauncey, to the highest room of the tallest tower! Where my princess awaits rescue from her handsome Prince Charming."
gingerbread man,This is worse than Love Letters! I hate dinner theatre.
pinocchio,Me too.
prince charming,"Whoa there, Chauncey!"
actress,Hark! The brave Prince Charming approach-ith.
prince charming,Fear not fair maiden! I shall slay the monster that guards you and take my place as rightful King.
old lady, What did she say?
ogre,Grrrrrrr!
fairytale creatures, Woooo hoooo!!!
gingerbread man,Yea! Shrek!
prince charming,Prepare foul beast to enter into a world of pain with which you are not familiar!
waiter, Happy Birthday to thee.
prince charming,Do you mind?
gingerbread man,Do you mind? Bo-ring!
prince charming, Prepare foul beast-
prince charming, Someday you'll be sorry.
heckler, We already are!
ogre,Grrrrrrr!
prince charming, Oh mommy.
prince charming,"Oh, you're right. I can't let this happen. I can't."
prince charming,I am the rightful King of Far Far Away and I promise you this mother. I will restore dignity to my throne!
shrek,Good morning.
fiona,Good morning.  Oh... morning breath...
shrek, I know. Isn't it wonderful?
donkey," ""Good morning! Good morning!"""
donkey, And you!
donkey,"Oh, they grow up so fast."
shrek,Not fast enough.
puss,"Okay. You have a very full day filling in for the King and Queen. There are several functions that require your attendance, sir."
shrek,Great! Let's get started.
donkey,"C'mon, lazy bones, time to get movin'!"
donkey,Aaahhh! You know you really need to get yourself a pair of jammies.
shrek,I knight thee...
shrek,He-he. Ooh.
donkey,"Well, since you're filling in for one, you might as well look like a real King. Can somebody come in here and work on Shrek please?"
raul, I will see what I can do.
fiona,Ow!
donkey,Oh!
puss,"Yeah, wow."
fiona,"Uh, is this really necessary?"
raul," Ho, ho. Quite necessary, Fiona."
shrek,"I'm Shrek, you twit."
raul,Whatever.
puss,Okay peoples! This isn't a rehearsal. Let's see some hustle.
donkey,"Smiles everyone, smiles!"
shrek,I don't know how much longer I can keep this up Fiona.
fiona,"I'm sorry Shrek, but can you please just try to grin and bear it? It's just until Dad gets better."
fiona,Shrek?
shrek,Yeah.
fiona,You look handsome.
shrek,"Ah. Come here, you."
shrek,"Oh, my butt is itching up a storm and I can't reach it in this monkey suit!"
shrek,Oh.  Hey you. Come here!
shrek,What's your name?
fiddlesworth,"Eh, Fiddlesworth, sir."
shrek,Hoo hoo hooo. Perfect.
shrek,"You've done it. Oh, a little over to the left, yeah. That's great."
fiona,Uh Shrek?
shrek,"Ahh! All right, you got it...Oh yeah, you're on it. Oh that's it! Oh that's good!"
fiona,Shrek...
shrek,Oh yeah! Scratch that thing! You got it. You're on it. That's great!
fiona,SHREK!
donkey,Ow!! My eye! My eye!
woman,What are you doing?
shrek,Fiona!
fiddlesworth,Uhhh... 
shrek,Are you okay?
fiona,Yeah. I'm fine.
fiddlesworth,Ahhhh!
donkey,Oh! Shrimp! My favorite.
shrek,That's it! We're leaving!
fiona,"Honey, please calm down..."
shrek,"Calm down? Who do you think we're kidding? I am an ogre! I'm not cut out for this, Fiona and I never will be."
donkey,I think that went pretty well.
shrek,Donkey!
donkey,"Aww, come on now Shrek!"
puss,Some people just don't understand boundaries.
fiona,"Just think... a couple more days, and we'll be back home in our vermin-filled shack, strewn with fungus, filled with the rotting stench of mud and neglect."
shrek,"Oh, you had me at ""vermin-filled."""
fiona,"And, uh... maybe even the pitter- patter of little feet on the floor...?"
shrek, That's right. The swamp rats will be spawning.
fiona,"Uh, no... you know, what I was thinking of is a little bit bigger than a swamp rat."
shrek,Donkey?
fiona,"No, Shrek. Um... what if - THEORETICALLY -"
shrek,Yeah?
fiona,They were little ogre feet?
shrek,Oh. 
shrek,"Honey? Let's try and be rational about this. Have you seen a baby lately? They just eat and poop and they cry and then they cry when they poop and they poop when they cry...Now, imagine an ogre baby. They extra cry and they extra poop."
fiona,Shrek.
fiona,Don't you ever think about having a family?
shrek,"Right now, you're my family."
shrek,"Well, somebody better be dying."
king harold,I'm dying.
queen,Harold.
king harold,"Don't forget to pay the gardener, Lillian."
queen,Of course darling.
king harold,Fiona...
fiona,Yes Daddy?
king harold,I know I've made many mistakes with you.
fiona,It's okay.
king harold,But your love for Shrek has taught me so much.
king harold,"My dear boy, I am proud to call you my son."
shrek,And I'm proud to call you my Frog... King Dad in-law.
king harold,"Now, there is a matter of business to attend tooo..."
puss,The Frog King is dead.
donkey," Put your hat back on, fool."
king harold,"Shrek, please come hither."
shrek,"Yeah, Dad?"
king harold,This Kingdom needs a new king. You and Fiona are next in line for the throne.
shrek,"Ooo. Next in line. Now you see Dad, that's why people love you. Even on your deathbed you're still making jokes."
shrek,"Oh, come on Dad...an Ogre as King? I don't think that's such a good idea. There's got to be somebody else. Anybody?"
king harold,Aside from you there is only one remaining heir.
shrek,"Really!? Who is he, Dad?"
king harold,His name is... is... is...
shrek,What's his name? What's his name?
king harold,...is ...
fiona,Daddy!
king harold, His name is Arthur.
shrek,Arthur?
king harold, riiiight...
queen,Harold!?
shrek,Dad? Dad? Dad?
donkey,"Do your thing, man."
prince charming,What does a Prince have to do to get a drink around here?
prince charming,"Ah Mabel, why they call you an ugly stepsister I'll never know."
prince charming,"Where's Doris, taking the night off?"
mabel,She's not welcome here and neither are you.
prince charming,"Oh not much, just a chance at redemption...  And a Fuzzy Navel."
prince charming,And Fuzzy Navels for all my friends!
captain hook,We're not your friends.
prince charming,Ahh!
captain hook,You don't belong here.
prince charming,"You're right; oh, I mean you're absolutely right, but I mean, do any of us?"
cyclops,Do a number on his face!
prince charming,"No, no, wait, wait, wait! We are more alike than you think."
prince charming,Wicked Witch. The Seven Dwarves saved Snow White and then what happened?
evil queen,"Oh, what's it to you?"
prince charming,"They left you the un-fairest of them all. And now here you are, hustling pool to get your next meal. How does that feel?"
evil queen,Pretty unfair.
prince charming,And you? Your star puppet abandons the show to go and find his father.
puppet master,I hate that little wooden puppet.
prince charming,And Hook...
prince charming,And you! Frumpypigskin.
rumplestiltskin,Rumplestiltskin.
prince charming,"Where's that first-born you were promised, hey?"
prince charming,"Mabel, remember how you couldn't get your little fat foot into that tiny glass slipper?"
prince charming,"Cinderella is in Far Far Away right now, eating Bon Bons, cavorting with every little last Fairy-tale Creature that has ever done you wrong."
prince charming,"Once upon a time, someone decided that we were the losers. But there are two sides to every story. And our side has not been told."
prince charming,So who will join me? Who wants to come out on top for once? Who wants their happily ever after?!
puss,"It's out of my hands senorita, the winds of fate have blown on my destiny. But I will never forget you. You are the love of my life."
donkey,"I know, I know... I don't want to leave you either baby, but you know how Shrek is. The dude's lost without me."
donkey,But don't worry. I'll send you airmail kisses everyday!
donkey,"Alright, be strong babies! Be strong. Now, Coco, Peanut, you listen to Mama, alright? And Bananas, no more roastin' marshmallows on your sister's head."
donkey,"Ah, that's my special boy. Oh, come over here, all of you. Give your Daddy a big hug!"
fiona,"Shrek, maybe you should just stay and be King."
shrek,"Oh, c'mon, there's no way I could ever run a kingdom. That's why your cousin Arthur's the perfect choice."
fiona,"It's not that. No. It's, you see..."
shrek,"Fiona, soon it's just gonna be you and me and our swamp."
fiona, It's not going to be just you and me.
ship captain,All aboard!
shrek,It will be. I promise. I love you.
fairytale creatures,Awwwwwwwww!
donkey,Bye bye babies!
fiona,Shrek!
shrek,Yeah?
fiona,Wait!
shrek,What is it?
fiona,"I'm, I'm-"
shrek, I love you too honey!
fiona,"No... No, I said I'm pr-"
shrek,You're what?!
fiona,I said I'm pregnant!
shrek, Uh... what was that?
fiona,You're going to be a father!
shrek, That's great.
fiona,Really? I'm glad you think so! I love you.
shrek,Yeah...  Me too... you...
donkey,I'm gonna be an Uncle. I'm gonna be an Uncle! I'm gonna be an Uncle!
puss,"Oh, and you my friend are royally--"
shrek,Ahhh. Home.
shrek,Woohoo!
shrek,Ahh.
shrek,Ooo. 
shrek,Fiona!
shrek,Fiona?
shrek,Huh? Oh no.
shrek," Better out than in, I always say. Ha ha!"
ogre baby,Hiccup!
shrek,"No, no, no, no, no, no. Ha, ha. It's okay. It's gonna be alright."
ogre baby,Da-Da!
shrek,"Hey! Hey, hey, wait! Would ya? No, no. Stop! Hey, hey, hey. No."
shrek,Huh?
ogre baby,Bubabatoo?
shrek,"Ahhhh! Oh, Donkey! Donkey, wake- up!"
donkey, Da-da!
shrek,Ahhhh!
donkey,"Shrek. Shrek, are you okay?"
shrek,Oh... I can't believe I'm going to be a father.
shrek,How did this happen?
puss,"Allow me to explain. You see, when a man has certain feelings for a woman, a powerful urge sweeps over him..."
shrek,I know how it happened. I just can't believe it.
donkey,How does it happen?
donkey, Little boy blue and the man in the moon.
shrek,"Donkey, can you just cut to the part where you're supposed to make me feel better?"
puss,"You know I love Fiona, Boss. Right?  But what I'm talking about here is you, me, my cousin's boat, an ice- cold pitcher of mojitos, and two weeks of nothing but fishing."
donkey,"Man, don't you listen to him. Having a baby is not going to ruin your life."
shrek,It's not my life I'm worried about ruining. It's the kid's.
shrek,"I mean...when have you ever heard the phrase ""as sweet as an...ogre"" or ""as nurturing as...an ogre"" Or how `bout...""you're gonna' love my dad...he's a real ogre."""
donkey,"Okay, okay I get it! Nobody said it was going to be easy. But at least you got us to help you out."
shrek,That's true.
shrek,I'm doomed.
donkey,You'll be fine.
ship captain,You're finished.
ship captain,"Uh, with your journey."
donkey,Wor-ces-ter-shireee. Now that sounds fancy.
shrek,It's Worcestershire.
donkey,Like the sauce!? Mmmm... It's spicy!
donkey,Oohh! They must be expecting us.
donkey,What in the shista-shire kind of place is this?
shrek,"Well, my stomach aches and my palms just got sweaty. Must be a high school."
donkey,High school?!
cheerleaders,"Ready?! Okay! Where for art thou headed, to the top? Yeah we think so, we think so! And dost thou thinkest thine can be stopped? Nay we thinks not! We thinks not!"
van student," For lo bro, don't burn all my frankincense and myrrh."
donkey,I'm already starting to feel nauseous from memories of wedgies and swirlies!
puss,But how did you receive the wedgies when you are clearly not the wearer of the underpants?
donkey,Let's just say some things are better left unsaid and leave it at that.
guineverre,"So then I was all like ""I'd rather get the black plague and lock myself in an iron maiden than go out with you."""
tiffany,"Eh, totally."
shrek,Pardon me...
guineverre,Eh! Totally ew-th!
tiffany,"Yeah, totally!"
gary,Yes! I just altered my character level to plus three superbability.
shrek,"Hi, we're looking for someone named-"
gary,"Gee, who rolled a plus nine ""dork"" spell and summoned the beast and his quadrupeds."
xavier,Ha! Ha!  Ah!
shrek,"I know you're busy ""not fitting in"" but can either of you tell me where I can find Arthur?"
gary,He's over there.
jocks,Oy! Right! Ooo! Ooo! Ooo!
shrek,"Strong, handsome, face of a leader. Does Arthur look like a King or what?"
shrek,Oh. Sorry.
puss,That information is on a need to know basis.
donkey,"It's top secret, hushity hush."
jocks,Oy! Right! Ooo! Ooo!
shrek,"Oh, ho, ho, ho. Giant mutant leprechaun... You made a funny."
shrek,"Stop squirming, Arthur."
lancelot,I am Lancelot.
lancelot,That dork over there is Arthur!
shrek,Hey!
lancelot,Aaah.
guineverre,"Ahem! This is like totally embarrassing, but my friend Tiffany thinkest thou vex her so soothly..."
guineverre,And she thought perchance thou would wanna ask her to the Homecoming Dance or something...
shrek,"Uh, excuse me?"
guineverre,It's like whatever. She's just totally into college guys and mythical creatures and stuff.
shrek,"Oh Arthur! Come out, come out wherever you are..."
donkey,"Yeah, you better run, you little punk no good-niks, `cause the days of ""Little Donkey Dumpy Drawers"" are over!"
shrek, We're here for the Mascot Contest too.
hall monitor, This is a costume?
shrek, Aaaiyyyy... worked on it all night long!
hall monitor,Looks pretty real to me.
puss,If it were real could I do this?
donkey,Or this?
shrek, He's right! If it were real that would have been agonizingly painful!
donkey,Now watch this....
shrek, That's quite enough boys.
principal pynchley,"Thank you to Professor Primbottom for his invigorating lecture on how to just say ""nay""."
principal pynchley,"And now, without further ado, let's give a warm Worcestershire-hoozah to the winner of our ""New Mascot"" contest... the--"
shrek,That's right. I'm the new mascot. So let's really try and beat the other guys... at whatever it is they're doing.
principal pynchley,This is indeed all a bit unorthodox.
shrek,"Now, where can I find Arthur Pendragon?"
lancelot,Classic.
donkey,You should be ashamed of yourself.
lancelot,I didn't do it. They did.
artie,Please don't eat me.
students, Eat him! Eat him!
principal pynchley,Eat him! Shrek yanks on Artie and pulls him off the hoop.
shrek,I'm not here to eat him.
students,AWWW.
shrek,It's time to pack up your toothbrush and jammies. You're the new King of Far Far Away.
artie,What?
lancelot,Artie a King? More like the Mayor of Loserville.
bohort,Nice one Lance!
lancelot,Burn.
artie,Is this for real?
shrek,"Absolutely. Now clean out your locker, kid. You've got a kingdom to run."
artie,"So wait, I'm really the only heir?"
shrek,The one and only.
artie,Give me just a second.
artie,"My good people, I think there's a lesson here for all of us. Maybe the next time you're about to dunk a kid's head in a chamber pot, you'll stop and think, hey, maybe this guy has feelings. Maybe I should cut him some slack. Because maybe, just maybe... this guy's gonna turn out to be, uh...I dunno...a King! And maybe his first royal decree will be to banish everyone who ever picked on him -- that's right, I'm looking at you, jousting team."
artie,And Gwen... oh Gwen. I've always loved you.
guineverre,Ew.
artie,"Well good friends, it breaks my heart, but, enjoy your stay here in prison while I rule the free world baby!"
shrek,"Alright, let's not overdo it."
artie,I'm building my city people! On Rock and Roll!
shrek,You just overdid it.
artie,Ow!
princesses, Oh!
snow white,Look at you!
rapunzel,Wow!
snow white,You look darling!
sleeping beauty,Just precious! Look at her!
rapunzel,"So, have you had any cravings since you've been pregnant?"
fiona," No, no, not at all."
fiona,Do you smell ham?
snow white, Oooh! It's present time!
cinderella,"Oh, Fiona, won't you please open mine first? It's the one in front."
fiona," ""Hopefully this helps. Love, Cinderella."""
princesses,Oooo! Aaaah!
doris,Will you look at that!
sleeping beauty,What is it?
cinderella,It's for the poopies.
sleeping beauty,"Eww. Wait, babies poop?"
rapunzel,Everyone poops Beauty.
pigs,Yah!
princesses,Oooh.
gingerbread man,You know the baby's gonna love it because I do!
fiona,"Oh, you guys, that's so sweet. Thank you."
fiona,Who's this one from?
snow white,I got you the biggest one because I love you the most.
fiona," ""Have one on me, love Snow White"""
fiona, Umm... what is it?
snow white,"Ha, haaa! He's a live-in baby- sitter."
nanny dwarf,Where's the baby?
fiona,"You're too kind, Snow, but I can't accept this."
snow white,Think nothing of it. I've got six more at home.
fiona,What does he do?
cinderella,The cleaning.
snow white,The feeding.
nanny dwarf,The burping.
fiona,So what are Shrek and I supposed to do?
rapunzel,"Well, now you'll have plenty of time to work on your marriage."
fiona,"Gee thanks Rapunzel, and what's that supposed to mean?"
rapunzel,"Oh, come on now, Fiona. You know what happens."
sleeping beauty, Huh? You're tired all the time...
snow white,You'll start letting yourself go...
gingerbread man,Stretch marks!
rapunzel,Say goodbye to romance.
dragon,Yort.
fiona,Um sorry... but how many of you have kids?
doris,She's right. A baby is only gonna strengthen the love that Shrek and Fiona have. How did Shrek react when you told him? Tell me!
fiona,"Well, when he first found out...Shrek said-"
dragon,Roarrr!
prince charming,Gaa! Gulp! Ahhhh!
prince charming,"Now, bombs away!"
evil trees,Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
captain hook,"Well, well, well. If it isn't Peter Pan."
mother,His name's not Peter!
captain hook,"Shut it, Wendy!"
mother,Ahhh!
cyclops,"Ha, ha, ha, ha!"
prince charming,Enough pillaging! To the castle!
dragon,Roarrrr!
gingerbread man, You go and take care of the baby!
snow white,Everybody stay calm. We're all going to die!
fiona,Everyone in! Now.
prince charming,C'mon. Put some back into it people!
cyclops,Yee-haw! Ow.
fiona,We don't have time. Now go!
queen,Quickly ladies!
gingerbread man,We'll hold them off as long as we can!
prince charming,Where are Shrek and Fiona?
gingerbread man,Name doesn't ring a bell.
prince charming,I suggest you freaks cooperate with the new King of Far Far Away.
gingerbread man,"The only thing you're ever gonna be King of is ""King of the Stupids."""
prince charming,Hook!
captain hook,Right!
captain hook,"Avast, ye cookie!"
captain hook,Start talkin'!
muffin man,Gingy!
gingerbread man,Papa!
teacher,"Settle down, now."
gingerbread man," ""On the Good Ship Lollypop, It's a sweet trip, To the candy shop, Where the Bon Bons play, On the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay.."""
prince charming,You! You can't lie. So tell me puppet... Where is Shrek?!
pinocchio," Well, I don't know where he's not."
prince charming,You're telling me you don't know where Shrek is?
pinocchio,It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume that I couldn't exactly not say that is or isn't almost partially incorrect.
prince charming,So you do know where he is!
pinocchio,"On the contrary, I'm possibly more or less, not definitely rejecting the idea, that in no way, with any amount of uncertainty that..."
prince charming,Stop it.
pinocchio,If that indeed wasn't where he isn't. Even if he wasn't not where I knew he was could mean that I wouldn't completely not know where he wasn't.
prince charming,He's bringing back the next heir?
pinocchio,No!
prince charming,"Hook! Get rid of this new ""King."""
captain hook,Right!
prince charming,But bring Shrek to me. I have something special in mind for him.
pinocchio,He'll never fall for your tricks!
wolf,Oh boy.
artie,"I can't believe it... me a King? I...I mean I knew I came from royalty and all, but I just figured everyone forgot about me."
shrek,"Oh no, in fact, the King asked for you personally."
artie,"Really? Wow! Look, I know it's not all gonna be fun and games."
shrek,"It really is all fun and games, actually. Sure, you have to knight a few heroes, launch a ship or two. By the way, make sure you hit the boat just right with the bottle."
artie,Boat with the bottle? Any idiot can hit a boat with a bottle.
shrek,"Well, I've heard it's harder than it looks."
artie,"Whoa!! This is gonna be huge. Parties, princesses, castles... princesses."
donkey,"It's gonna be great, Artie. You'll be living in the lap of luxury. They got the finest chefs around waiting for you to place your order."
puss,And fortunately you'll have the royal food tasters.
artie, Oh yeah? What do they do?
puss,"They taste the food before the King eats, to make sure it's not poisoned."
artie,Poisoned?
shrek,Or too salty!
donkey, Don't worry about it. You'll be safe and sound with the help of your body guards.
artie,Body guards?
puss,"All of them, willing at a moment's notice to lay down their own lives out of devotion to you."
artie,Really?
puss,"Si, and the whole kingdom will look to you for wisdom and guidance."
donkey,Just make sure they don't die of famine.
puss,Or plague.
donkey,"Oh, plague is bad."
puss,"The coughing, the groaning, the festering sores."
shrek,"Oh! Festering sores! Hey, you are one funny kitty cat."
puss,What did I say?
shrek,We don't want Artie here getting the wrong idea.
all,Whoa!
ship captain,"Whoa! Oh, there goes my hip."
shrek,Artie!
artie,What does it look like?!
shrek,This really isn't up to you!
artie,But I don't know anything about being King!
shrek,You'll learn on the job!
donkey,Whoaaa!
artie,"Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm going back!"
shrek,Back to what? Being a loser?!
artie,Look what I did? Who's holding the wheel chief?
donkey, Shrek!
puss,How humiliating...
shrek,"Oh, nice going, Your Highness."
artie,"Oh, so now it's ""Your highness?"" What happened to ""loser?"" Huh?"
shrek,"Hey, if you think this is getting you out of anything, well it isn't. We're heading back to Far Far Away one way or another, and you're gonna be a father!"
artie,What?
donkey, A-hem. You just said father...
shrek,You're... I said king. You're gonna be King!
artie," ""You're gonna be King!"" Yeah right."
shrek,Where do you think you're going?
artie,Far Far Away... from you!
shrek,You get back here young man and I mean it!
puss,"Uh boss, I don't think he's coming back and maybe it's for the best. He is not exactly king material."
donkey,When were you planning on telling him that you were really supposed to be King?
shrek,"Oh c'mon, now why would I do that? Besides, he'll be ten times better at it than me."
donkey,"Hey, woah ho ho, Shrek. Then you're gonna have to change your tactics if you want to get anywhere with this kid."
shrek,"You're right, Donkey."
shrek,What about this?
donkey,Shrek!
shrek,Oh c'mon. It's just a joke.  Still...
shrek,Listen Artie...
shrek,"I mean, if it doesn't groove or what I'm saying ain't straight trippin', just say, oh no you didn't, you know, you're gettin' on my last nerve. And then I'll know it's... then I'll know it's whack--"
artie,SOMEBODY HELP! I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY A MONSTER TRYING TO RELATE TO ME!
shrek,Artie! Wait!
artie,C'mon! C'mon! Help! Help! Hello?
donkey,AHHHH!
merlin,I knew I should of gotten that warranty!
merlin,"AHH! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow."
artie,Mr. Merlin?
shrek,You know this guy?
artie,Yeah. He was the school's magic teacher until he had his nervous breakdown.
merlin,"Uh, technically I was merely a victim of a level three fatigue, and at the request of my therapist and the school authorities, I have retired to the tranquility of nature to discover my divine purpose."
merlin,"Now, can I interest anyone in a snack or beverage?"
shrek,"Uh, no."
merlin,Sure you don't wanna try my famous rock au-gratin?
merlin,It's organic!
shrek,"Oh, thanks, I just ate a boulder on the way in. What we need are directions back to Far Far Away."
artie,"What's with the ""we""? Who said I was going with you?"
shrek,"Oh, I did. Cause there's a lot of people counting on you so don't try and weasel out of it."
artie,"If it's such a great job, why don't you do it?"
shrek,"Understand this kid, it's no more Mr. Nice Guy from here on out!"
artie,"Oh, so that was your ""Mr. Nice Guy?"""
shrek,"I know, and I'm gonna miss him."
artie,You know what? Why don't you go terrorize a village and leave me alone?
shrek,"Oh, is that some kind of crack about ogres? You get your royal highness to Far Far Away before I kick it there.  Now which way am I kicking?"
merlin,"Oh, I could tell you. But since you're in the midst of self- destructive rage spiral it would be karmic-ly irresponsible."
shrek,"Self-destructive ra...  Look, are you gonna help us or not?"
merlin,"Most definitely, but only after you take the journey to your soul."
shrek,"Yeah, I don't think so."
merlin,"Look pal, it's either that or some primal scream therapy. Ahhhhhhhhhh!"
shrek,"Alright, alright... journey to the soul..."
merlin,"Now all of you, look into the ""Fire of Truth"" and tell me what you see! Yah! Ha!  Woo-looo-looo-looo!"
donkey,"Ooo! Charades! Okay, I see a dutch fudge torte with cinnamon swirls."
merlin,"Okay. Monster, go for it."
shrek,I see a rainbow pony.
merlin,Excellent work!  Now! The boy!
artie,This is lame.
artie,Ow!
merlin,You're lame! Now just go for it.
artie,Okay. There's a baby bird and a father bird sitting in a nest.
merlin,Yes! Stay with it! Stay with it!
artie,"Wait, the dad just flew away. Why did he leave the little bird all alone?"
artie,"It's trying to fly, but it doesn't know how to. It.. it's gonna fall!"
merlin,"Whew, proper head case you are, aren't you? Really messed up. Whoa."
artie,"Yeah, yeah, okay. I get it. The bird's me. My dad left. So what?"
shrek, Look Artie...um-
merlin, Just thought I might help set the mood! Y'know for your big heart to heart chat!
shrek,I know what it's like to not feel ready for something.
shrek,"Even ogres get scared...you know, once in a while."
artie,"I know you want me to be king, but I can't. I'm not cut out for it and I never will be, alright?"
shrek,My dad wasn't really the fatherly type either.
artie,"Well, I doubt he was worse than mine."
shrek,Oh yeah? My father was an ogre. He tried to eat me.
shrek,"Now, I guess I should have seen it coming. He used to give me a bath in barbecue sauce and put me to bed with an apple in my mouth."
artie,Okay... I guess that's... pretty bad.
shrek,"You know, it may be hard to believe what with my obvious charm and good looks, but people used to think that I was a monster. And for a long time, I believed them."
artie,"You know, you're okay, Shrek."
artie,You just need to do a little less yelling and use a little more soap.
shrek,Thanks Artie.
artie,The soap's because you stink. Really bad.
shrek,Yeah. I got that.
cinderella,Oh this place is filthy. I feel like a hobo.
snow white,I'm sorry but this just isn't working for me.
sleeping beauty,"Everything's always about you, isn't it? It's not like your attitude is helping, Snow."
snow white,Well maybe it just bothers you that I was voted fairest in the land.
rapunzel,You mean in that rigged election?
snow white,"Oh, give me a break.  ""Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down thy golden extensions!"""
queen,"Ladies, let go of your petty complaints and let's work together."
snow white,So I guess the plan is we just wander aimlessly in this stink hole until we rot.
fiona,"No, we're gonna get inside and find out what Charming's up to."
doris,"I know he's a jerk and everything, but I gotta admit, that Charming makes me hotter than July."
sleeping beauty,Ew!
rapunzel,Ugh.
fiona,That's it!
rapunzel,"Come on, this way!"
fiona,Rapunzel. Wait!
fiona,"Charming, let go of her."
prince charming,But why would I want to do that?
rapunzel,Grrrr!
prince charming,Woof!
fiona,What?
prince charming,"Say hello ladies, to the new Queen of Far Far Away."
cinderella,Yaaaaaaaaay!
fiona,"Rapunzel, how could you?"
rapunzel,Jealous much?
prince charming,"Soon you'll be back where you started... scrubbing floors or locked away in towers; that is, if I let you last the week."
rapunzel,"But Pooky, you promised you wouldn't hurt them!"
prince charming,"Not here, ""kitten whiskers."" Daddy will discuss it later. Now forgive us, we have a show to put on."
fiona,"Shrek will be back soon Charming, and you'll be sorry."
prince charming,Sorry? Don't you realize --once Shrek sets foot in Far Far Away he's doomed?
artie,Ow!
donkey,Ahhh!
donkey,Look out! They've got a piano!
captain hook,Kill `em all. Except the fat one.
captain hook,"King Charming has something special in mind for you, ogre."
shrek,"""King Charming?"""
captain hook,Attack!
pirates,AAAARGH!
shrek,"Artie, Duck!"
donkey,Ahhh!
captain hook,Ha-ha! Argh!
pirates,Argh! Argh!
captain hook,Ready the plank!
donkey,Shrek!
artie,Help!
captain hook,Ya cowards!
shrek,What has Charming done with Fiona?
captain hook,She's gonna get what's coming to her.
captain hook,Ahhh.  And there ain't nothing you can do to stop him!
puss,We've got to save her!
donkey,But she's so far far away!
shrek,"Get yourself back to Worcestershire, kid."
artie,"No, Shrek. Hold on a second. I've got an idea."
merlin," I'm a buzzing bee, buzz, buzz, buzz..."
artie,"Mr. Merlin, they need a spell to get them...I mean, us, back to Far Far Away."
merlin," Forget it. I don't have that kind of magic in me anymore, kid. How about a hug instead? Hmm? That's the best kind of magic."
artie,Mr. Merlin please. I know you can DO IT-
merlin,"I said, forget it!"
artie,BUT-
merlin,"Oh. What, what's with you?"
artie,It's just so hard. You know? They really need to get back `cause their kingdom's in trouble `cause there's a really bad man and it's just so hard...
merlin,"C'mon, take it easy."
artie,No! I don't think you understand! There's a mean person doing mean things to good people-
shrek,"Oh, have a heart old man!"
artie,And they really need your help to get them back! So why won't you help them?
merlin,Oh.
merlin,"Uh, Okay... I'll go and get my things."
artie,Piece of cake.
shrek,"Well, well, well. You want some eggs with that ham?"
merlin,"Now, I am a little rusty, so there could be some side effects."
donkey,Side effects!?
merlin,"Don't worry, whatever it is, no matter how excruciatingly painful it may be, it'll wear off eventually... I think."
donkey,Ah!
merlin,Oops.
donkey,Are you sure this is a good idea?
shrek,"Look, if Artie trusts him, that's good enough for me. Even if his robe doesn't quite cover his-"
merlin,"Alacraticious expeditious, a zoomy zoom zoom. Let's help our friends get back, um... soon!"
merlin,Woah! It worked!
shrek,Donkey?
donkey, What? Is there something in my teeth?
donkey, Oh no!
donkey, I've been abracadabra'd into a fancy feasting second rate sidekick.
puss, At least you don't look like some kind of bloated roadside piata. You really should think about going on a diet!
donkey," Yeah, and you should think about getting yourself a pair of pants! I feel all exposed and nasty."
donkey," Oh, so you two think this is funny?"
artie, I'm really sorry guys.
shrek,Don't be! You got us back kid.
donkey," Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. How in the Hans Christian Andersen am I supposed to parade around in these goofy boots?"
puss,Be very careful with those - HEE HAW!
puss,They were made in Madrid by the finest- HEE HAW!
donkey," Oh, you'll learn to control that."
donkey,"Seriously man, you need some comfort inserts or arch supports or something.  Woah!"
evil witches,Woohoo!!
shrek,Pinocchio?
pinocchio,Shrek!
shrek,Pinocchio!
pinocchio,Help me!
shrek,What's happened?
pinocchio,Charming and the Villains have taken over everything! They attacked us but Fiona and the Princesses got away. And now she's- -
shrek,She's what?! She's what!?
shrek," Puss, loan me five bucks!"
donkey,"C'mon Puss, you heard the man, help a brother out."
puss, Do you see any pockets on me?
donkey, Hold on a second.
donkey, Aha!
puss, I had no idea ...really ...I swear.
shrek,"Quick, Pinocchio. Where is Fiona?"
pinocchio,Charming's got her locked away some place secret. You gotta find him! He's probably getting ready for the SHOWWWW---
shrek,"Wait, wait, wait! Pinocchio! What show?"
puss," It's A Happily Ever After, After All!"
shrek,Shrek's final performance.
donkey," Whoa, Shrek! You didn't tell us you were in a play."
shrek,Well I guess I've been so busy I forgot to mention it!
puss," Don't worry, Jefe. I got this."
artie,"Look, don't you know who he thinks he is? How dare you?"
shrek,"Donkey, we're dealing with amateurs."
artie,He's a star people! Hello?! I'm so sorry about this Mr. Shrek.
shrek,I'm gonna lose it!
artie,I assume you have everything ready for tonight! You did get the list for the dressing room?
donkey," Yeah, the breakfast croissants stuffed with seared sashimi tuna. Oh, and please tell me you at least have the saffron corn with the jalapeno honey butter cause our client cannot get into his proper emotional state without his jalapeno honey butter."
shrek,I just lost it!
puss," Oh, we'll have much to say to Nancy, I promise!"
prince charming," With this sword, I do- No."
prince charming,"With this sword, I do smote thee!"
prince charming," Is that the right word? ""Smote?"" ""Smooote."" Is that even a word actually? Maybe I should just smite him."
prince charming,Let's try this again. Now...
prince charming, Ooh!!!
prince charming,"I say...  ""Finally the Kingdom will get the happily ever after they deserve, die Ogre"", blah, blah, blah..."
prince charming,Oh! It just doesn't feel real enough yet!
prince charming,Who told you to stop dancing?!
cyclops,"Uh... Wink and turn, wink and turn."
prince charming,And what are you laying around for? Get up! Honestly.
prince charming,"Our happily ever after is nearly complete, mummy. And I assure you, the people of this kingdom will pay dearly for every second we've had to wait."
shrek,"Break a leg. Or, on second thought, let me break it for you."
prince charming,Thank goodness you're here. I was beginning to think you might not make it back in... time.
shrek,Where's Fiona?
prince charming,Don't worry. She and the others are safe. For now.
artie,Ow.
prince charming,Let me guess... Arthur?
artie,"It's Artie, actually."
prince charming,This boy is supposed to be the new King of Far Far Away?
prince charming,"How pathetic! Now, stand still so I won't make a mess."
shrek,"Charming, stop! I'm here now, you got what you wanted. This isn't about him."
artie,"Then who's it about? I'm supposed to be King, right?"
shrek,"You weren't really next in line for the throne, okay? I was."
artie,But you said the King asked for me personally.
shrek,Not exactly.
artie,What's that supposed to mean?
shrek,"Look, I said whatever I had to say, alright! I wasn't right for the job, I just needed some fool to replace me, and you fit the bill. So just go!"
artie,You were playing me the whole time.
shrek,You catch on real fast kid... Maybe you're not as big of a loser as I thought.
artie,"You know, for a minute there, I actually thought you -"
prince charming,What? That he cared about you? He's an ogre. What did you expect?
prince charming,"You really do have a way with children, Shrek."
snow white,"Had we just stayed put like I suggested, we could be sipping tea out of little heart-shaped cups..."
cinderella,"Yeah... yeah, heart shaped cups."
snow white,Eating crumpets smothered with loganberries.
cinderella,Yeah... loganberries.
snow white,Shut up Cindy.
cinderella,"Yeah, shut up."
cinderella,Just stay out of this!
snow white,Who cares who's running the kingdom anyway?
fiona,I care.
queen,And you should all care too.
puss," Hey, hey, hey, hey."
donkey," Yeah, and I have your badge number, ""TIN CAN-"""
donkey, Princess?!
fiona,Puss?!
puss," Lo siento, Princessa, but I am Puss, stuck here inside this hideous body."
donkey, And I'm me!
fiona,BUT YOU'RE-
donkey," I know, I know. Everything's a little fruity in the loops right now. But what happened is, we went to high school, the boat crashed, and we got ""bippity-bopity-booped"" by the ""Magic Man."""
doris,You poor sweet things.
cinderella,I don't get it.
snow white,The cat turned into a little horse that smells like feet. What's to get?
sleeping beauty, Huh? Who dat?
fiona,Where's Shrek?
donkey,"Charming's got him, Princess. And he plans on killing Shrek tonight in front of the whole kingdom."
fiona,"Alright everyone, we need to find a way out, now."
snow white,"You're right.  Ladies, assume the position!"
fiona,What are you doing?
sleeping beauty,Waiting to be rescued.
fiona,You have got to be kidding me.
snow white,"Well, what do you expect us to do? We're just four...  I mean, three, super hot princesses, two circus freaks, a pregnant ogre and an old lady."
queen,Hmmm. Excuse me. Old lady coming through.
queen,Hiiiyyyiiiaaaah!
fiona,Mom!?
queen,"Well, you didn't actually think you got your fighting skills from your father, did you?"
snow white,"Excuse me, I think there's still one more."
queen,Hmmmm.
queen,Hiiiiyah!
fiona,Why don't you just lie down?
fiona,"Okay girls, from here on out, we're gonna take care of business ourselves."
announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen. The Far Far Away Theatre at the Charming Pavilion is proud to present: ""It's a Happily Ever After, After All."""
shrek,"Oww, easy."
cyclops,Sorry. I guess I was just showing off for the little one.
shrek,Huh?
cyclops,"It's ""Bring your kids to work day."" C'mere beautiful."
shrek,Well... she's got your eye.
cyclops,Who woulda thought a monster like me deserves something as special as you?
snow white," ""Ahh ha ha ha haa."""
snow white," ""Ha ha ha ha haaaa. Little birdies take wing, flitting down from the trees they appear, and to chirp in my ear."""

gingerbread man,"As I recall it was ""Team Awesome."""
wolf,"I voted for ""Team Alpha Wolf Squadron."""
donkey,"Alright! Alright! Alright! From henceforth we are to be known as ""Team Alpha Super Awesome Cool Dynomite Wolf Squadron."""
donkey, Artie!
puss," Wait, wait, wait, wait wait. Hey! Where is the fire, Senor?"
artie,"Oh please, don't act so innocent. You both knew what was going on the whole time and you kept it to yourself."
donkey," Artie, it's not like it seems."
artie,It's not? I think it seems pretty clear. He was using me. That's all there is to it.
donkey," Using you? Man, you really don't get it!"
puss, Shrek only said those things to protect you!
donkey, Charming was going to kill you Artie. Shrek saved your life.
rumplestiltskin,Cue the spot!

rapunzel," ""Oh please, rescue me!"""

shrek,Oh boy.
prince charming,"You are about to enter a world of pain with which you are NOT-  ""FamiliaAAAAAAR!"""
shrek,Well it can't be anymore painful than the lousy performance you're giving.
rumplestiltskin,"""Prepare foul beast."""
prince charming," ""Prepare foul beast, your time is done."""
shrek,"Oooh, if you don't mind could you kill me, and then sing?"
prince charming,Be quiet!

shrek,Artie?
artie,Who really thinks we need to settle things this way?
artie,You're telling me you just want to be Villains your whole lives?
captain hook,But we are Villains. It's the only thing we know.
artie,Didn't you ever wish you could be something else?
prince charming,You morons! Don't listen to him! ATTACK THEM-
artie,"Okay, fair enough. You're right. I'm not a talking tree. But, ya know, a good friend of mine once told me that just because people treat you like a villain, or an ogre..."
artie,... or just some loser...
rumplestiltskin,Me?
other pirates,Get `im lads!
artie,"No, no, no! What I mean is: each of you is standing in your own way!"

puss,And I am not you!
donkey,Alright!
merlin,"Oops. Ah, never mind."
shrek,What'd I tell ya? I think the kid's going to be a great King.
