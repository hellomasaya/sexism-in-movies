Speaker,Dialogue
2.,"CONTINUED: BUTCH That's not a bad place to start. CUT TO: EXT . - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT Title: Three Weeks Ago... The same alley... The door of a building bursts open as LIONEL DOLBY , dressed in a cheap suit, stumbles out breathing heavy. The dim light of a bare bulb glares off the sweat on his forehead. A moment later, Jake emerges from the same door carrying a large black revolver. JAKE I lost my head. I'm... Sorry.    I don't know what happened. LIONEL Y-y-you fucking shot him!   That's what happened! JAKE I had to! That motherfucker was about to welch! You saw what he was doing, right? You heard him! Lionel starts shaking his head spastically. LIONEL I can't be here! You understand?     I can' t-- JAKE Listen to me! It went to shit.     It happens sometimes. In the distance, A POLICE SIREN WAILS, growing louder. LIONEL Oh Jesus! JAKE LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me! Jake takes a tentative step forward.     Lionel sees a BLOOD STAIN on Jake's shirt and recoils. The SIREN GROWS LOUDER, Jake turning his head towards it."
3.,"CONTINUED: LIONEL What-- What do we do? JAKE Help me. Jake waves Lionel back through the door they came out of. CUT TO: INT. - THE EUCLID BAR A dive furnished with a few mismatched chairs and a bar. A single overweight PATRON sits at a corner table with face buried in his hands as he WHIMPERS. Jake and, Lionel Dolby pass him as they emerge from a back hallway. MILES, late 20's, wipes blood off the bar. Placed at the edge of the bar are two briefcases, both open, both filled with neat stacks of blood splattered money. A DEAD GUY lies face down on the floor in a pool of blood. Jake grabs the Dead Guy's legs as Lionel watches in disbelief. JAKE Come on.    Grab his arms. Lionel stands frozen.       Jake, drops the dead guy's legs with a THUD. JAKE Lionel... He's dead. Yeah, maybe you didn't pull the trigger, but you were standing right there and watched me do it. Help me. Grab his arms. The POLICE SIRENS grow LOUDER. MILES Tick-tock... JAKE If you wanna help, then help.    If not, shut up. MILES Your mess. JAKE Then shut up. MILES My place."
4.,"CONTINUED: Miles lets out a little chuckle; it's just enough to set Jake off again. Jake pulls the gun and points it at Miles. MILES Oh please... Miles non-chalantly pulls a sawed off shot gun frown under the bar. MILES  I didn't see nothing. And I swear if you let me go now, I won't say- JAKE Relax, porkchop. The POLICE SIRENS sound like they're right outside. LIONEL I can't be here! Jake cocks his gun, never taking his stare off Miles. JAKE Then go. Lionel looks at the briefcases of bloodied money. LIONEL What about... The money? JAKE What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now? Lionel again looks at the briefcases; then the shotgun leveled at Jake; then at the direction of the POLICE SIRENS... He runs for the door without a second thought. CUT T0:"
6.,"CONTINUED: ROTTOVICH Guy looked like he was trying not to shit himself.  Nice. DEAD GUY What took so fucking long? The Dead Guy stirs-- GORDO, late 20's, dressed in a blood soaked suit stands up; wiping blood off his face. DEAD GUY/GORDO I've been lying in this shit like half the night. MILES You guys were late.   We had to go to a Mexican stand-off. JAKE And you know I hate guns. Jake tosses the revolver on the bar. SOBOZINSKI We were fighting crime. MILES Keeping the city streets safe for drug dealers and pedophiles everywhere. Jake starts taking    the money out of the briefcases. Gordo strips out of the    jacket and shirt, revealing a THIN WHITE VEST. A wire runs     from a battery pack on his belt, up the center of the    vest, ending at a scorched, bloody, explosive squib. Gordo drops the vest along with a plastic bag containing fake blood. A nasty bruise on his chest marks the spot where the squib was. GORDO Shit. JAKE I told you, use less powder. GORDO But you won't get that splatter effect. Jake removes the blood stained bills from the top of the pile."
7.,"CONTINUED: JAKE Then these go into your cut. Big Al moves over to the bar. BIG AL Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside? JAKE Gordo plays the inside.   You're the Shill. BIG AL Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted. JAKE What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you? BIG AL I' m gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls? Al slaps Jake on the back and exits. Jake catches Gordo hawking over his shoulder. JAKE What?   I can feel you looking at me. GORDO That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick. JAKE Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back. GORDO I guess. I gotta drop a dime.    Did anybody mess up the hoop? MILES It's clean. Gordo disappears dawn the back hallway."
8.,"CONTINUED: Jake rubber bands two small wads of cash and hands them to Rottovich and Sobozinski. JAKE Ten percent. SOBOZINSKI You guys got sack, I'll give you that much. JAKE Confidence.     It's just confidence. Sobozinski and Rottovich head for the door with their newly padded pockets. ROTTOVICH  Feels a little light, Jake.    Next time we're in for twenty. MILES Twenty?   My ass! JAKE What are you talking about?    Ten's standard. ROTTOVICH Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces. SOBOZINSKI Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture? JAKE We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite? ROTTOVICH Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals. JAKE All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack. ROTTOVICH Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat?"
9.,"CONTINUED: ROTTOVICH  It's what makes us run. And despite what they say, it can buy you love. CALL GIRL Are you ready for me, Ralph? She lets the overcoat fall open, revealing her lack of clothing. CUT TO: INT.- PRADA STORE- NIGHT Gordo stands in front of a mirror trying on a new suit. The sales people fawn over him."
10.,"CONTINUED: JAKE  Oops. She throws Jake a smile he can't but help return. They stand for a second facing each other before she's whisked away by an OLDER MAN, dressed in an expensive suit."
11.,"CONTINUED: Jake's smile fades as he watches her saunter into the bar, but not before she throws him another glance over her shoulder. Jake continues on into... CUT TO: INT.- NEIGHBORHOOD BAR- CONTINUOUS A semi-crowded bar.    Not hip and trendy like ""Wax."" Jake finds an empty stool at the end of the bar and orders a drink. He takes a second to look around at the cliques of people talking, laughing, having a good time before he pulls a newspaper out his coat pocket. Jake takes a pen from the bar and opens to the crossword section. JAKE  Oops."
12.,"CONTINUED: The realization makes Jake smile. Then a FLAPPING SOUND spins him around to see a PIGEON, flapping up against the inside of a partially opened window. Visibly upset by the bird, Jake moves towards the window and pushes it wide, allowing the bird to escape. JAKE Dumb fucking luck. Jake stares out the window after the bird. CUT T0: INT.- DOLBY'S APARTMENT- NIGHT A nicer apartment than Jake's. Lionel Dolby, the Mark from the Euclid rushes around, haphazardly throwing things into a suitcase. There's a KNOCK on the door that stops Lionel dead in his tracks. Another KNOCK.       Lionel still frozen. The door flies open with a      BOOM. In the doorway, we see HARLIN, an older mountain      of a man dressed in a plain black suit. Behind him is       LUPUS  You better get over to Al's.    Now."
13.,"CONTINUED: Miles hangs up before Jake can answer. CUT TO: INT.- BIG AL'S- DAY Jake stand's with Miles in the sparse living room. Big AI's body sits reclining on a Lazy Boy chair, eyes bulging open. An open carton of food rests in his lap. A feast of take-out Chinese surrounds him. The TV blares an old episode of ""The Little Rascals."" There's a singed, neat bullet hole in his forehead. MILES I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti-Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got. JAKE Miles... MILES Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg- foo-young. Big Al stares up at them with those bulging, vacant eyes, his mouth hanging open. Jake reaches down and grabs the remote control and turns the TV off. JAKE  Big Al used to send money to his Father, some Vietnam Vet slowly losing his mind in a VA hospital in Cleveland. Al was like that. That's why Al never played the Inside. CUT TO: INT.- DINER- DAY Gordo enters and takes a seat in the back booth with Jake and Miles. GORDO Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River. JAKE Well, this is just fucking great..."
14.,"CONTINUED: GORDO It gets worse. Now I know     why he was such a good rope. X mean,     cash.... That much and we never had    to put him on the ""Send?"" Turns out     this ducking Moe was an accountant for    the King Pin. Gordo throws Jake a hard look, letting the news sink in. Jake can only slump back into the booth. MILES Who's that? GORDO The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. `Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says ""boo."" MILES What's a King Pin? Gordo looks to Jake, but can see that he's still processing the information. GORDO Currently, the King Pin is a very large- type pole stuck up our asses. MTLES Mob? GORDO Independant. Same shit, just independant. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald. MILES So what?   We hide, right? GORDO  What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do?"
15.,"CONTINUED: GORDO  Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is. MILES We sure Big Al threw him to us? GORDO Come on... All three of them turn their attention out the window. They watch the bustle of people walking past wondering if any one of them is looking back. JAKE A bird flew into my house last night. Gordo and Miles exchange a look, unsure of how to respond."
16.,CONTINUED: JAKE  The Euclid was our place. CUT TO:
18.,"CONTINUED: JAKE Meet me at my place later. MILES How do you know the King's going to let you walk? JAKE I'm getting a ride. Jake picks up the phone and dials another number. CUT TO: EXT.- THE BULLDOG GYM- NIGHT A neon sign in the shape of a boxing glove tells you what kind of gym it is. A police car comes to a stop in front. Rottovich and Sobozinski in the front seats. Jake gets out of the back. SOBOZINSKI The King, huh? Nice going. JAKE I try. ROTTOVICH Don't dick around too long. And if he stabs you or shoots you or causes any other form of profuse bleeding, call a cab because you are not getting back in this car! Jake nods and approaches the door where Harlin and Lupus stand vigil. Lupus wears another loud sweatsuit. HARLIN We appreciate your punctuality.   Mr. King is expecting you. Jake takes a step towards the door, but is pushed up against The wall by Lupus who begins to roughly pat Jake down. HARLIN Lupus! LUPUS What? You said pat him down, I'm pattin' him down. Harlin shakes his head and pushes Lupus out of the way."
19.,"CONTINUED: HARLIN It only takes a moment to be polite. My apologies, Mr. Vig. If you wouldn't mind? Jake steps back and raises his arms. JAKE You the one that did it?   You the one that got Al? HARLIN Mr. King prefers to farm out for that kind of work.  Uh... Which one's the King Pin? HARLIN He's in the back taking a steam. Jake nods and let's out a silent sigh of relief. CUT TO: INT.- STEAM BATH- CONTINUOUS A huge room filled with steam. Harlin and Lupus stand by the door as Jake cautiously steps in. NEW AGE MUSIC is being played-- Could be Yanni. Sitting in a lounge chair, wearing a white terry cloth robe is THE KING PIN. His large body is less fat than just big, constructed of circles and topped off with the baldest head you've ever seen. A MANICURIST sits next to the King Pin working on his nails."
20.,CONTINUED: KING PIN Ow!   Watch the pinkie! This isn't so bad.     Jake almost has to stifle a laugh. KING PIN 
21.,"CONTINUED: KING PIN  Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much."
22.,"CONTINUED: JAKE No.   Just confidence. The King Pin stands up and moves over to Jake. KING PIN I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once. JAKE We got caught. So you know it won't happen again. With surprising speed, the King Pin grabs Jake by the neck. KING PIN I know it won't happen because you're going to feel like a Prom Queen who just got gang fucked by the wrestling team! A few pained CHOKES from Jake as his knees buckle. HARLIN Mr. Vig arrived with an escort.   NYPD. The King loosens his grip and let's Jake fall. KING PIN Grifters... Always working  an angle. Alright. I can see you got   some vision. But I give you the Mark. I   tell you the who and you give me the  how. Lupus go with him. Lupus snaps to attention. LUPUS What? KING PIN Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me. Jake begins to speak, but is silenced with a look. KING PIN He goes.   Now let me see your hands."
23.,"CONTINUED: The King picks up the nail file again. JAKE Why? KING PIN You ask a lot of questions.   Come on.  Jake shakes his head slowly. JAKE I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley."
24.,"CONTINUED: BUTCH And these cops? What do they get? CUT TO: INT. - SQUAD CAR- NIGHT Rottovich and Sobozinski sit staked out in front of a small cigar/magazine store. JAKE  Just a tip. SOBOZINSKI What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin? ROTTOVICH You sell it. SOBOZINSKI To who? ROTTOVICH Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand... SOBOZINSKI You think this is a good idea?    We never did this kinda shit before. ROTTOVICH What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns. A hooded figure turns a corner onto the street, heading for the Cigar Shop. He wears a knapsack slung over his shoulders. SOBOZINSKI Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered. ROTTOVICH It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic."
25.,"CONTINUED: ROTTOVICH  Whoa, whoa... There he is. We HEAR the SOUNDS OF CAR DOORS OPENING, then SLAMMING SHUT. Moonan puts down the mic and hits ""STOP"" on a microcassette recorder. MOONAN Confessions of a poor brusher. Moonan takes a second to remove his gum, then checks his teeth in the rearview mirror. CUT TO: EXT.- STREET/BROOKLYN- SAME Rottovich and Sobozinski walk quickly down the street. Ahead of them, the hooded figure approaches, his hands buried in his pockets, a knapsack slung over his shoulder. As he gets closer, we see that he's just a KID of about ten or eleven. Rottovich reaches over and pulls off the Kid's hood. SOBOZINSKI You know who we are? KID The heat."
26.,CONTINUED: Rottovich can't help smiling. ROTTOVICH That's right. We're the heat.  Butch and Jake... BUTCH Keeping the Fix happy.
27.,"CONTINUED: JAKE You never know when you can use a crooked cop. BUTCH Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby. JAKE So you want to know how to play the Big Con. BUTCH In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con. Butch shoves the gun a little harder into Jake's head. CUT TO: INT.- BAR- NIGHT A trendy bar, dimly lit and packed. We PAN along the hip crowd and STOP on Jake speaking with a SLICK GUY dressed in black Armani. JAKE  There's that saying-- Show me an honest man and I'll show you a natural born liar. There's always that little bit of bad no matter how much good. It's that little itch on the back of you neck. You may not even know it's there, but it is. The Fat Texan MORPHS into a WALL STREET-type suit, who remains stoic as Jake reaches over for another round of drinks."
28.,"CONTINUED: JAKE  I tell you the ""Tale""-- It's the story of how we're going to make easy money. No one gets hurt. And here's the guy who's going to help. That's when you meet the Insideman."
29.,"CONTINUED: Gordo approaches, dressed in a suit and looking slightly anxious. Introductions are made. JAKE  Then someone does... BLAM!!! CUT TO:"
31.,CONTINUED: Dolby eyes the briefcases of money. DOLBY What about... The money? JAKE  Butch eases the gun off Jake's head. BUTCH So how'd you get caught?
32.,"CONTINUED: JAKE Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer. CUT TO: INT.- JAKE'S APARPMENT--NIGHT Empty except for Gordo, Miles, Jake and Lupus, dressed in another of his trademark loud sweatsuits. JAKE We're working for the King. MILES  Wait a second... Who's the mope? LUPUS I'm the King's eyes and ears.   Just in case you decide to get cute. MILES So we gotta short con our way out of a hundred and fifty grand? That could only take like, a year. JAKE No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill. MILES What do we need another Shill for? JAKE Breasts. CUT TO: INT . - WAX--NIGHT A crowded night... LILY, the attractive blonde from earlier, flirts with a well dressed, OLDER MAN who has his hand firmly planted on her ass. She squeezes his hand and gives him a quick peck on the cheek before walking away. She takes a look at the man's wallet she just lifted before putting it in her bag. From out of nowhere, Jake bumps into her."
33.,CONTINUED: JAKE  Jake.
36.,CONTINUED:
37.,"CONTINUED: JAKE  There's a story going around that he helped fund the Contras back in the eighties. Gillette and his crew head through a large glass revolving door to... CUT TO: EXT.- CITY BANK OF MANHATTAN- DAY A busy mid-day New York sidewalk.       Gillette heads towards a waiting Town Car. JAKE Most of his money's clean. A lot of it isn't. The best part is that we know exactly where it is. As Gillette and his crew disappear into the car, we PAN up to see the front of the building which has a large sign reading, ""City Bank of Manhattan; A Gillette Family Company."" CUT TO: INT.- THE EUCLID-- RESUMING Jake looks over the crew, who are less than convinced. GORDO How much we going after? JAKE Two million. Miles lets out a whistle."
38.,"CONTINUED: GORDO We only owe the King a hundred and fifty. JAKE We get fifty percent.   And we get clear of the King. Jake looks over at Lupus for confirmation. LUPUS That's worth it right there. You ask me, I don't think you can do it. MILES I'm with Jack LaLane.   That guy's untouchable. JAKE That's why we don't go after him directly. CUT TO: INT.- CITY BANK OF MANHATTAN/LOBBY Empty. The marble floor spotless, the dark oak teller windows vacant, a row of desks. JAKE  We pay better."
39.,CONTINUED: An envelope stuffed with cash MATERIALIZES on the desk next to Ashby. CUT TO: EXT . -- CAYMEN ISLANDS--DAY Crystal clear water gently rolls onto a white beach. JAKE  It's bank policy not to release this money in cash because it's under a corporate account.
40.,"CONTINUED: The Teller turns to a computer printer and removes a check. Jake signs a few documents and places the check into his pocket. CUT TO: EXT.- CAYMEN ISLANDS/STREET--DAY Lined with shops and stores, but it's as empty as the bank. Not even a car: Jake strides out of the Grand Caymen's Bank and walks across the street to another building with a sign reading ""BANK OF THE GRAND CAYMENS."" CUT TO: INT.- BANK OF THE GRAND CAYMENS- DAY Again, empty... Jake strides in and approaches the deserted teller counter. ANOTHER TELLER MATERIALIZES and greets him with a smile. JAKE  That's why you need someone on the inside at Customs. Jake approaches and slides the suitcase towards him. The Officer slides it back to Jake, revealing another envelope stuffed with cash under it."
41.,"CONTINUED: The Officer literally looks the other way as he pockets the envelope and waves Jake through the gate. CUT TO: EXT.- JFK AIRPORT- DAY Jake exits the terminal. Outside, the street is empty, not a traveler, an airlines rep, a luggage handler or a cab. Jake waits at an empty cross walk until the ""walk"" signal is given. JAKE  This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard. GORDO People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A. JAKE It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs. MILES Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea... JAKE Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?"
42.,"CONTINUED: MILES We never had a problem with that before. JAKE Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before. MILES What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on `til the next local putz caught on. JAKE We're getting a little old for running. MILES Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I' m not like ""twenty-five to life"" pissed. JAKE I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo? GORDO Yeah... Whatever, Jake. JAKE No, not ""whatever."" You're either in or you' re out. A silence falls over everyone. LILY I'm in. Her eyes stay on Jake as a smile grows across her face. CUT TO: EXT.- PAY PHONE- DAY Jake dials a number... JAKE  I agreed with Miles. It was, hands down, a dumb fucking idea."
43.,"CONTINUED: JAKE  Yeah, it's Jake. How'd that tip work out? CUT TO:"
44.,"CONTINUED: Moonan holds up crime scene photos of Big Al's body. MOONAN  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His ""Fix."" SOBOZINSKI What do you want?"
45.,"CONTINUED: MOONAN You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross-departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it. SOBOZINSKI What do you get out of it? MOONAN Peace of mind. SOBOZINSKI That's it? MOONAN Not everyone's on the take, Walter. ROTTOVICH If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now? MOONAN I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act. SOBOZINSKI This guy must have been a real pain in your dick. MOONAN Literally. It's not a bad deal, gentleman. I get peace of mind. You get Detective Sheilds. But this is the best part, Walter... Walter, your daughter will get to keep her braces and have that winning smile. Capice? Rottovich and Sobozinski remain silent. MOONAN Good. One more thing... You gotta give up the booty. I can't have you guys running around with heroin. FREEZE FRAME ON MOONAN'S SMILING FACE."
46.,"CONTINUED: JAKE  A serious look comes across Jake's face-- Hate.       Butch eases back with the gun for a second. JAKE He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars. BUTCH Cue the fucking violins.   Come on... It's getting cold. CUT TO: INT. - THE KIEV DINER- DAY Gordo, Miles, Jake and Lily next to him, all crammed into a booth. MILES Am I the only one who feels like we can't make a move with this guy on us? LILY We should ditch him. JAKE Just watch every thing you say around him. Every word, every move... It all goes back to the King Pin. Lupus exits the restroom, heading back towards the booth. GORDO How's the hoop, superstar?   Clean? LUPUS What is it with you and bathrooms? MILES He doesn't like using a bathroom unless he knows it's clean. LILY Manly."
47.,"CONTINUED: GORDO You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease- JAKE Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance... MILES Is it all fugasi? JAKE No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker. LILY What about Customs? JAKE I'll worry about Customs. LILY Hey, I' m not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut. JAKE Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something. Jake rolls his eyes as Lily glares at him. CUT TO: INT.- BULLDOG GYM- DAY Boxers at the bags, a jumping rope, etc... Jake and Lily stand in front of the King Pin, who's dressed in shorts and a t-shirt. He wears boxing gloves and headgear. Lupus and Harlin stand vigil by the sparring ring. KING PIN How much?"
48.,"CONTINUED: JAKE I think two million. KING PIN What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid. JAKE I need you to stake me. KING PIN Stake you? JAKE I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done. King Pin eyes Jake suspiciously for a second. KING PIN That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up? JAKE Nothing ventured, nothing gained. KING PIN Hey Skippy? Do I have the word ""chump"" tattooed on my forehead? LILY Mr . King, I think--- JAKE "
49.,"CONTINUED: JAKE And I gotta tell you, for a guy who spends all his time in a gym, you could be in better shape. A few of the BOXERS training around stop and turn.          The King Pin lowers a glare at Jake. KING PIN Take off your shirt. Jake looks behind him to see Harlin looming. JAKE Excuse me? KING PIN I said take off your fucking shirt. A few more BOXERS stop and turn. Jake notices he's being watched. The King Pin takes a step towards Jake... JAKE Fine. You want me to take it off, I'll take it off. Jake unbuttons his shirt and stands in front of the King Pin, arms crossed. It's getting weird. KING PIN Look at you, you skinny prick. JAKE You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you? The King smiles and begins to take off his shirt.       Harlin and Lupus share an uncomfortable glance. The King strips down to the waist and reveals an incredibly large, incredibly round stomach which he SLAPS loudly. KING PIN Come here.   Feel this. JAKE No thanks.   I'm good. KING PIN Come here! The King grabs Jake's hand and puts it on his stomach. It just got weirder. Now the whole gym has stopped, everyone focused on Jake and the King Pin."
50.,"CONTINUED: LILY You guys are freaking me out. KING PIN Shut up. Feel that? That's solid muscle. Not an ounce of fat. Go ahead. Punch it. JAKE I am not going-- The King starts to get that look again. Jake winds up and punches the King in the stomach.           He shakes his fist in pain. KING PIN Come on.    Harder. JAKE I think I just broke my hand. KING PIN Harder.    Remember, I killed your buddy. Jake's demeanor changes as he winds up and hits the King as hard as he can. The King just smiles. KING PIN  All muscle. The King then hits Jake back in the gut with surprising speed. Jake falls to his knees, but the King's right there. With one arm he pulls Jake up and starts to pummel him in the stomach with an unbridled visciousness. Jake spits up blood as the King hurls him face first into the ring. KING PIN Maybe it's true. Maybe you can't cheat an honest man. Me? I'm about as dishonest as they come and that's the truth. But if you even think about trying to con me they'll find fucking pieces of you in each of the five boroughs. Pieces of you, pieces of her, pieces of your whole crew. Can't be any mare honest than that. I'll stake you, but that's three hundred fifty you're in the hole and consider the juice running. Now go make me proud. Harlin and Lupus lift Jake up.        Lily looks at Jake with a pained expression."

I'll tell you what you're looking for without even meeting you. It's like a personal ad you wear over your head. Jake watches as she hails a cab. A MAN, also hailing a cab goes for the same one. Michelle gets into a screaming match with the man. FREEZE FRAME ON MICHELLE--- A CGI SIGN appears over her head ""Single, volatile, confrontational woman seeks ""man"" for economic security and house chores."" JAKE No. CUT TO:"
54.,"CONTINUED: JAKE Now we had the con and the mark.    We needed to look the part... They're greeted by FRANKIE SUITS, an ancient rake-thin man, perfectly coiffed and exceptionally dressed. JAKE  So I see. In from Long Island?     You fellas take a look around. GORDO Hey Suits? You got anything in like a eleven or twelve ounce Super 100 worsted? Miles gives him a look like he's speaking latin. Jake and Lily follow Suits into... CUT TO:"

Corporate papers with the New York State seal, insurance documents with a proof of bonding and some fugasi financial records. There's also the I.D. you asked for. Jake takes out the papers and gives them the once over. He then puts an envelope thick with cash on the desk. JAKE Aces, Suits. SUITS Not easy   pickin's. Papers like these speak to   larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into   something big? JAKE Pretty much. SUITS In over your head? JAKE Pretty much.     Suits eyes Lily. SUITS Can I speak to you in confidence? JAKE Huh?   Oh.   She's alright. Suits gives Lily another suspicious look. SUITS Try and keep up... You ask for      the Advantage Goods, then you guys      come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I       gotta think you're either working the      mace or playing the Jug Mob. JAKE A little bit of both. Lily watches in utter confusion. SUITS Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake."
56.,"CONTINUED: SUITS  I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, ""the kid's a prodigy.'"" But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark? JAKE Can't say. SUITS Then who's the Banker? JAKE The King. A dead look comes over Suits. SUITS The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all. JAKE I can handle it. SUITS I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame? JAKE It's not history. SUITS So what do you want? JAKE I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it. SUITS Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want. Jake considers those words for a moment. JAKE Yes I can. Suits guages the seriousness in Jake's face and nods. The he gently rests his hands on the papers."
57.,"CONTINUED: SUITS Still time. JAKE Can't do it Suits.      I can't lay down for this one. SUITS Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We Jake, Jake? Suits holds out his hand.         Jake takes it. JAKE We're Jake. They shake, knowing it'll be the last time. CUT TO: INT.- GARMENT DISTRICT/WAREHOUSE- CONTINUOUS We follow Lily and Jake out of Suit's office.           Lily can see that it's thrown Jake a bit. LILY What the hell's his problem? JAKE Don't worry about it. LILY It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry? Jake stops and turns to her, looking her up and down. JAKE You need to get a haircut. LILY What? JAKE And some new clothes. LILY Why?"
58.,"CONTINUED: JAKE We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can. LILY You're just going to have to trust me. JAKE I don't trust anyone. LILY Then show me how. CUT TO: INT. - TIFFANY'S - NIGHT Jake and Lily enter the store. Jake takes a quick moment to case the place-- A few scattered CUSTOMERS, some being helped by SALESPEOPLE. All the Customers look like the uppercrust crowd you'd expect at Tiffany's. JAKE  This is about confidence. Your confidence and their confidence. You get their confidence by giving them yours. Jake leaves Lily by the front counter as he starts a slow turn around the store. He casually pretends to be browsing as he moves next to MR. LEWIS, an older, distinguished looking gentleman, being helped by a SALEGIRL, who is scribbling on an order form. SALESGIRL Let me read this back. One silver Cattier watch, engraved-- ""To Carolyn, the Attorney at Law. Happy Graduation, Counselor. Love Mom and Dad."" MR. LEWIS Right. SALESGIRL One bracelet, engraved ""To Abby.   Happy 25th Anniversary, Love Tom."""
59.,"CONTINUED: MR. LEWIS Perfect. SALESGIRL I' ll just go put this in, Mr. Lewis. The Salesgirl takes the order form and walks away. A change comes over Jake. It's subtle-- Posture, facial expressions, a slight tug of an accent-- but it's there. JAKE Mr. Lewis? Mr. Lewis turns and looks at Jake. There's no real hint of recognition, but Jake's smiling up at him like an old friend. JAKE It is you.   Hello! Jake extends his hand. MR. LEWIS Sorry, I-- JAKE Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice. Mr. Lewis seems to search for second, then extends his hand more in an effort not to appear rude. MR. LEWIS Of course.   Jake. Nice to see you. JAKE Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis? MR. LEWIS Great.   Thank you. The Salesgirl returns. JAKE Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson. SALESGIRL Do you have a ticket?"
60.,"CONTINUED: JAKE You   know, this is kind of embarassing, but   my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm   afraid the ticket was in it. But the   name's Pearson. MR. LEWIS While you're back there, could you make sure that Carolyn is spelled with a ""y""? The Salesgirl nods and disappears again. MR. LEWIS  What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend? JAKE My wife and I are just taking a little vacation. Behind his back, Jake discreetly waves Lily over. MR. LEWTS Carolyn's down this weekend too. Lily approaches. When she does, Jake pulls her close and gives her a loving kiss on the lips. It throws Lily for a second. LILY Uh... Everything okay? JAKE Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily. Lily and Mr. Lewis exchange handshakes. JAKE I'm sorry, honey.    I'm almost done. Jake taps Lily on the back with the hand wrapped around her waist. LILY It's okay.    I'll be looking for earrings. Jake gives Lily another kiss before she leaves. MR. LEWIS Attractive girl."
61.,"CONTINUED: JAKE Thank you.    Actually, it's our first anniversary   this weekend. She thinks I'm here to   pick up something for my mother, but   it's actually a gift for her. Think    I've fooled her? MR. LEWIS Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it? JAKE Very much so. Jake smiles ear to ear, like the happy newlywed he's pretending to be. The Salesgirl returns. SALESGIRL We have Carolyn with a ""y"". I'm sorry, there's nothing under Pearson. If we had an invoice number-- Jake's smile dissolves as he grows a little anxious. JAKE I told you. My wallet was stolen. Please... Check again. Jake takes a nervous look over at Lily, who is drying on earrings with another Salesperson. MR. LEWIS Good luck.    Congratulations again. He and Jake shake hands. JAKE Thank you, sir. You know, I hope this isn't too much of an inconvenience, but if Carolyn is coming down for the weekend, perhaps I could give you something for her? It's a check. We split the cost on a few books and I haven't had the chance to pay her back yet. Could you..? MR. LEWIS Sure. Jake pulls out a checkbook and pen. JAKE  That'd be a great help."
62.,"CONTINUED: The Salesgirl returns. SALESGIRL I'm sorry.   Nothing under Pearson. JAKE You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster. SALESGIRL What was it? Jake quickley scans the jewelry in the glass case. JAKE A ring for my wife. Alot like that one. In fact, it was that one. SALESGIRL That's no problem. We have those in stock. JAKE Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks? SALESGIRL With identification. Jake stops writing on the check and locks up. JAKE I understand that, but I had my wallet stolen last night. Is there any way..? SALESGIRL I'm sorry. Jake's anxious look comes back. JAKE I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later..."
63.,"CONTINUED: SALESGIRL  This is embarrassing. MR. LEWIS Jake? Jake looks up and rips the check out from his book. JAKE I'm sorry, sir. Thank you very much for doing this. And please tell Carolyn hello for me. Jake seems to be lost. Mr. Lewis looks over at Lily, who gives him a friendly smile, then back to Jake. MR. LEWIS Why don't you let me put the ring on the card and you can write me a check in return? Unseen to Mr. Lewis, one corner of Jake's lip goes up in a grin. CUT TO: EXT.- TIFFANY'S/SIDEWALK--NIGHT Jake and Lily exit the store.     Jake hands Lily the trademark colored box. JAKE Happy anniversary. Lily takes the box and shakes her head, impressed. Jake Looks up to see Mr. Lewis watching them as he tries to hail a cab. Jake's demeanor quickly changes as he puts on a big smile. JAKE Smile. You just got a present from the man of your dreams. Lily puts on a big smile while opening the box. JAKE Now we gotta give him a strong finish."
64.,"CONTINUED: Jake pulls Lily closer and looks into her eyes. She leans in and they kiss-- A deep, slow kiss that makes people have to walk around them. Mr. Lewis sees them and smiles to himself as he gets into a cab. Jake and Lily are still kissing as the cab pulls away. Lily finally breaks the kiss--- Slowly. LILY He's gone. JAKE Uh-huh. LILY I gotta go get a haircut. JAKE Uh-huh. Jake watches as Lily walks away. She looks back at Jake once before disappearing around a corner. CUT TO: INT.- SIXTEENTH PRECINT- DAY Moonan sits on a desk, ear to a phone. JAKE  It was all in play. Everything... MOONAN It's Moonan... I'm in New York. Listen, I got Vig. He's here and I'm this close... Look, I understand that, but I'm telling you this time... Obsessive is a big word to use... Goddamn it, Lou! I'm telling you, this is it. Yeah... I figured you'd feel that way. So here's the deal... Call Kylie over at the Bureau. Tell him I got something that might interest him. A guy they call the King Pin. I think there may be a corruption case brewing here, too... That's right. So even if I don't get Vig, you'll still have something to show. Rottovich and Sobozinski enter."
65.,"CONTINUED: MOONAN  Butch takes out two cigarettes and lights both, sticking one in Jake's mouth. JAKE Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?"
66.,"CONTINUED: JAKE  Redheads. JAKE FUCK! Gordo, Lupus and Miles look up at Lily. GORDO Oh shit."
67.,"CONTINUED: Lily stands at the door watching Jake freak out in disbelief. FREEZE FRAME ON LILY and her new red hair. JAKE  But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house... Lily takes her jacket off revealing a delicate blouse, decorated with a design of flowers and a BIRD. FREEZE FRAME ON LILY'S BIRD BLOUSE. CUT TO:"
69.,"CONTINUED: LILY So much for that good feeling, huh? Silence.   Jake can feel the eyes on him. JAKE Anybody says a word I swear to God... Jake takes off after her. CUT TO: EXT. - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT  Butch cracks a big smile. BUTCH She had you tempting fate. JAKE My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million. LILY steps out from behind Butch. LILY Guess he passed on that unlucky- asshole gene. Lily looks down at Jake and the gun pointed at his head. There's not even a hint of sympathy. LILY You should have trusted me Jake. CUT TO: INT.- THE BULL AND THE BEAR PUB- NIGHT Jake turns and looks at the crew, Miles, Gordo, Lupus and Lily behind him. Grant Ashby sits alone at the crowded bar, doing his crossword puzzle. Jake a smile and saunters over to the bar. GORDO She up for this?"
70.,"CONTINUED: JAKE She's up for it. ANGLE ON ASHBY AT THE BAR Ashby sits finishing a drink. Snippets of CONVERSATION and LAUGHTER from the cliques around him catch his attention, but he remains alone. BLONDE  I wasn't sure if you'd make it. BLONDE Oh, I didn't know you... Here.    Sorry. Lily takes the barstool back. LILY No problem. The blonde woman leaves as Lily sits down next to Ashby. LILY Thanks for playing along.    I just have to sit for a while. ASHBY Tough day?"
71.,"CONTINUED: LILY Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking? ASHBY Uh, Maker's Mark.      Rocks. Lily signals the BARTENDER for two more drinks. ASHBY My name's Grant. Grant Ashby. LILY Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn. They shake, Ashby's demeanor brightening again. ASHBY So, what do you do? LILY It's more like what aren't I doing.        My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there. ASHBY Silicon Valley? LILY That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here. The drinks arrive.       Lily hands the bartender a twenty. ASHBY I can--- LILY On me.     For the seat.   Cheers. She flashes a trademark smile as they CLINK glasses. LILY So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say ""no"" without ever using the word."
72.,"CONTINUED: ASHBY Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery. Lily arches an eyebrow at Ashby. LILY Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us. ASHBY No, no.   Nothing like that.   I work in a bank. LILY  She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean."
74.,"CONTINUED: GORDO That's that Gillette guy, right?  Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing. RESUME ACTION JAKE Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan. ASHBY Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate--"
75.,"CONTINUED: JAKE A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part. ASHBY That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off. JAKE They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course. ASHBY Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back. JAKE We know exactly how we're going to make The money back. There in lies the Catch-22 ASHBY I don't follow. An uncomfortable silence falls. GORDO Jake... LILY It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys. She throws Ashby a flirty smile. LUPUS Yeah.   He's our boy. Lupus casually punches Ashby in the arm. It's meant to be a friendly tap, but it's hard enough to jerk Ashby's head to the side. Ashby lets out an uncomfortable LAUGH as he rubs his arm. JAKE  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com? ASHBY Big.Com.   That Internet thing."
76.,"CONTINUED: JAKE Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan. ASHY Sort of like a letter of intent. JAKE Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore. ASHBY And you have this letter of intent? JAKE  Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little. LILY We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now.   If they beat us to it... JAKE Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help. Ashby considers for a moment. ASHBY Should we get another round? Jake and Lily share an almost imperceptible look. CUT TO:"
78.,"CONTINUED: LILY I think you'd do it for free. You' re almost drooling. You like the rush. JAKE It's what I do. It's my job. LILY Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something? JAKE Are you asking me if I have something to prove? LILY Do you have something to prove? JAKE Not in that repressed anger sort of way. LILY I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option. JAKE Good quality porn has it's place in the world. LILY Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this? JAKE I'm good at it. Lying, cheating. Manipulating... I'm good at it. LILY It's more than that. JAKE Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would. LILY So that was my part?   Smile and shake my ass? JAKE No. You have another part?     You'll know what to do."
79.,"CONTINUED: LILY How do you know I will? JAKE Intuition. CUT TO: INT.- LILY'S APARTMENT- NIGHT Illuminated only by the light coming from the windows... Jake runs a hand down the length of Lily's bare back. She falls onto him, both of them hitting the bed locked in a deep kiss. Lily's hand moves down Jake's arm until it finds his hand. LILY You have really soft hands.    Like a baby's. JAKE  Redheads... Jake continues to LAUGH... CUT TO:"
81.,"CONTINUED: LILY  What the hell was his name? JAKE Glenn talked you out of it. LILY Sort of. I was telling him about this great love of my life who's name I don't remember, and I could see... He was getting pissed. I thought it was just because he was worried about me, but..."
82.,CONTINUED: LILY  Because I trust you too.
83.,CONTINUED: Jake tries a reassuring smile even though he's not sure it's something he should be smiling about. The spoon starts to RATTLE again as another subway train RUMBLES in the distance. CUT TO: EXT. - BACK ALLEY-NIGHT  We had to finalize the deal. ASHBY Everything looks in order. JAKE This has to happen fast. ASHBY I know.   It won't go unnoticed. JAKE There'll be red flags. Jake slides an envelope across the desk.
84.,"CONTINUED: ASHBY What's this? JAKE You need some convincing.       Consider it a convincer. Ashby leafs through the money in the envelope. ASHBY Let's just slow down for a second... JAKE You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you. ASHBY No, I understand that. What I mean... What I'm trying to say... I was actually wondering about... Well, my cut. ECU- A bead of sweat rolls down the back of Ashby's neck. JAKE  Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch. JAKE The standard ten. ASHBY Ten percent.     Of how much? JAKE Two million. GORDO We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over. JAKE And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow. There's a pause before Ashby smiles, then reaches around to scratch his neck. CUT TO: INT.- CITY BANK OF MANHATTAN/HALLWAY- DAY Jake exits Ashby's office with Lupus, Gordo, Miles and Lily. They all follow Jake down the hallway."
85.,"CONTINUED: GORDO You'll be there? JAKE Eight A.M. flight. GORDO Calls? JAKE We'll use the Euc. They pass the glass partitioned conference room. Jake looks inside to see Morgan Gillette holding court with a bunch of SUITS. Butch stands behind Gillette. For a second, Butch and Jake's eyes meet. CUT TO: EXT.- STREET- DAY Jake, Lily, Miles, Gordo and Lupus... As they move through the crowded sidewalk, Rottovich and Sobozinski appear behind them. ROTTOVICH Hey Jake. Jake turns just in time to catch Rottovich's fist square in the face. Jake staggers back and Sobozinski pushes him into an alley. JAKE That tip not work-out for you fellas? ROTTOVICH Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed. JAKE Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business. Sobozinski punches Jake in the stomach.    Miles and Gordo lurch forward-- SOBOZINSKI  Back up. LUPUS You want I should hold him down?"
86.,"CONTINUED: Gordo throws Lupus a look. ROTTOVICH Special Agent Gunther Moonan.     Ring a bell? JAKE Gunther?    I think I'd remember a Gunther. ROTTOVICH Ring it for him, Sobo. Sobozinski punches Jake again. JAKE Oh yeah.    Moonan.   I remember now. Thanks. ROTTOVICH Well he's   in town and he sure as shit remembers   you. What are we going to do about this   Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed   onto us. JAKE Wouldn't dream of it. Rottovich punches Jake hard in the stomach, sending him GASPING to the ground. ROTTOVICH I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develope a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake. JAKE  I always wanted to say that... As the cops exit, Lily, Miles and Gordo rush to Jake."

In the back, Moonan sits reading the Travel section of the NY Times. MOONAN Did he buy it? ROTTOVICH I think so.    What'd he ever do to you anyway? MOONAN Let's just say he burned me once. Moonan calmly turns the page of the paper. LUPUS  About four years ago, we were working in Miami, turf fixing for some local goon. CUT TO:"
89.,"CONTINUED: Moonan smiles and slides the envelope back over to Jake with a disappointed shake of his head. JAKE  Jake finishes the story to Lupus. JAKE And that's how Special Agent Gunther Moonan and I became friends. Lupus nods, satisfied. GORDO Moonan.    Here. Shit... LILY So what?   We just stay clear of him. Jake gets up, hard enough to knock the chair over. LILY Jesus... Take it easy."
90.,"CONTINUED: JAKE No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time. MILES What do we do? We change the scam? JAKE There is no scam!    I've got a fucking sign on my back!    I can't leave town now and come back   with a suitcase full of money. You get    it? It's over. We walk. GORDO Jake-- JAKE What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up. LILY That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this! GORDO Jake, I mean, come on-- JAKE No, no, no! Not  this time. I am doing this for your own good! You guys have got to learn when to stop. You with the Armani! You  with the hookers! MILES Escorts! JAKE Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there? LILY You are such a raving pussy sometimes. JAKE Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either."
91.,"CONTINUED: LILY Everyone's working an angle, right? JAKE There are three people I trust-- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray doq that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over. Lily looks around the room. No one seems to be backing her up. LILY What about... JAKE What about what? LILY What about the money? Jake stops and levels a look at Lily. JAKE So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology? LILY No, I want my cut! JAKE I'm going to say this one last time for You, so take a deep breath and count to ten. There is no cut. Lily levels a look of utter contempt at Jake. LILY You're an asshole. With that, she grabs her coat and leaves. Lupus sits quietly, taking it all in. GORDO So that's it... JAKE That's it."
92.,"CONTINUED: LUPUS King ain't gonna like this. JAKE Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet. LUPUS What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous. JAKE Of what?   They're both crooks. LUPUS Exactly. `Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door. JAKE My fucking heart bleeds. LUPUS Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business. JAKE Point, Lupus. Give us a point. LUPUS Point is, you don't go through with this, he's going to go after you next. And he don't even like you, Jake. Lupus stares blankly at Jake.

You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it. JAKE It's not true. BUTCH Yes it is Jake! Yes it is! They were right there for you. She was right there for you! Look at her!

Lily slowly reaches for the doorknob. Then the door flies open with a CRASH. Harlin fills the doorway. HARLIN The King would like to have a word with you. Lily, wide-eyed, stands frozen with the bat still cocked.. LILY Uh, right now? HARLI Please.    I have a car waiting. Lily takes a swing.      Harlin easily grabs the bat and backhands Lily. She      goes flying back into the far wall, bounces off and lands     with a THUD at Harlin's feet where she finds the butter     knife. Harlin reaches down and pulls Lily up by the hair.            The egg SIZZLES in the pan. Lily takes a stab at Harlin, but the knife just bounces off his coat. Harlin slaps Lily again, sending her flying into the stove. Smoke starts to rise from the burning egg. Harlin steps closer, but Lily throws her hands up in surrender. A spoon RATTLES in a cup as the RUMBLE of a subway train grows LOUDER.

MILES He should be landing in the Caymens about now. The Custom's guy is ready right? Jake stares off into space, absentmindedly flipping a penny in his hand. JAKE Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny-- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light. MILES And we got rid of the red head. Jake considers..."
99.,"CONTINUED: JAKE And we got rid of the red head. MILES Jake?   Customs? Jake just nods and continues flipping the penny.       JAKE  In order to ensure that we weren't going to welch, Ashby's pay-off was to be directly deposited into his own offshore account which he could confirm electronically. In this age of ecommerce, paper currency has become "" more of a liability than a commodity. Especially to us."
100.,CONTINUED: JAKE  ...They stick. Gordo shakes the Loan Officer's hand and calmly walks towards the door. CUT TO: EXT.- LAYMEN ISLANDS/STREET DAY Gordo walks across the street with the suitcase and pulls a cell phone from his pocket. GORDO First and ten.

CUT TO: INT.- THE EUCLID- NIGHT Jake sits at the bar, looking at his watch.    He notices his hand is shaking. LUPUS So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride. JAKE Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here. LUPUS You're a weasal. Lupus gets off the stool and we follow him into... INT.- THE EUCLID/BATHROOM- CONTINUOUS Lupus enters the small.    Bathroom and pulls a cellphone."

CUT TO: INT.- BULLDOG GYM/LOCKER ROOM- SAME The King Pin closes the cell phone and looks over at Harlin, who's hair is singed and matted down on one side. KING PIN He's got pigs for an escort.   You believe this guy? HARLIN I'll get the car. KING PIN Always something. The King struggles into a pair of pants, then turns around. KING PIN  My ass look big in this?

SOSOZINSKI You trust this Moonan guy? ROTTOVICH I don't trust anybody. You see   how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we   got leverage. And we trade; Vig for   that tape. I want to see it right in   front of my face. SOBOZINSKI It's just insurance. ROTTOVICH That's what I'm talking about. SOBOZINSKI I'm down! Sobozinski holds his hand up for a high five. ROTTOVICH What are you doing? SOBOZINSKI High five. ROTTOVICH Put your hand down. I don't high five. There's the CRACKLE from a walkie-talkie. MOONAN You guys awake? ROTTOVICH  We're here. CUT TO:"
107.,"CONTINUED: JAKE  I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john."

Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it. Jake hangs up the phone. LUPUS You really like that bitch don't you? I gotta tell you, I was pretty convinced that the whole thing before was blowing her off for her cut. You know how it is, get her to do some shit for you, throw her a bang to keep her happy. But, if you're into her... That's cool. JAKE That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different. LIONEL Not for nothing, Jake, but the guy who whacked your buddy? It was me. The King usually farms out for that kind of stuff, but I tell ya, he was so pissed off he couldn't wait for the regular guy. Fucker didn't even put down his Kung Pao Chicken."
109.,"CONTINUED: Jake seems to be reeling with the information. JAKE Egg Foo Young.  This is probably about where you came in. GILLETTE Wow. Now that's an exciting story. Butch, has anyone ever tried something like this before? BUTCH Not that I recall.   What do you want us to do about it? GILLETTE Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money."
110.,"CONTINUED: BUTCH So we go to the bar. GILLETTE I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby. BUTCH We'll take care of it. GILLETTE And how much did you say you wanted for this... What did you call it? A finder's fee? REVEAL Lily sitting on the couch in front of them, cell phone in hand. LIL Ten percent. GILLETTE Ten?    That seems a little high. BUTCH Ten is standard, sir. GILLETTE Fine.    But only if we recover the cash. LILY Only if--?    No way.     I want something for this. GILLETTE Have a   little faith in him, honey. Butch,   see if you can get him to tell you how   he did it. Or almost did it. Sounds   like a good story. BUTCH I' ll ask. Gillette picks up an APPLE from a bowl in his desk... The oldest con. GILLETTE Apple? CUT TO:"

CUT TO: EXT.- JFK AIRPORT/PARKING LOT- CONTINUOUS Rottovich turns the walkie talkie off as he and Sobozinski fall in behind Harlin. ANGLE ON MILES-- Who steps out of his car, watching the little parade go by with a look of confusion. CUT TO: INT.- THE EUCLID- SAME A LOUD THUMPING NOISE... Jake has Lupus by the hair as he rams his head repeatedly into the bar. Jake then gets him into a headlock. Lupus snaps his head back and butts Jake in the nose, sending him staggering back. CUT TO:"
113.,"CONTINUED: TNT.- JFK AIRPORT/TERMINAL- SAME Moonan taps the mic hidden in his sleeve, then checks the walkie. MOONAN Hello?   Can you hear me?

Jake straddles Lupus and raises the phone for the last whack. We HEAR A LOUD CLICK. Jake stops and the two slowly get up. As they stand, we can see that Lupus has the barrel of a small gun in Jake's mouth. Jake shuts his eyes tight, still holding the phone.    Which just then, RINGS. Jake opens his eyes and looks at the phone. Then to Lupus, who nods. Jake picks up the receiver and speaks, the gun still in his mouth. JAKE Eww-Whoa?
