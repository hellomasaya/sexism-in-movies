arkadi,"No, no. Sorry."
arkadi,...a real murder and panic. Billy taps on Karen's arm. Karen looks up at Arkadi.
first policeman,Where did you see the murder from ?
first policeman,And it was this man ?
first policeman,But you say here : He wore a stocking pulled over his head.
first policeman,And then they chased me through the building and try to kill me as well.
arkadi,We make test for you.
arkadi,For your film. We try make blood much big.
lyosha,We not tell you. Keep secret not to hurt your feelings.

arkadi,"No, she's right. I will show you."
andy,"Hey, we need that."
first policeman,"Sorry, I can do nothing for you now. But I will call you after I see the film. Okay ? Sorry. He walks away. The second policeman shakes hands with Arkadi and Lyosha and goes away with his chief."
andy,"Well, I've never been more embarrassed in my entire life."
karen,"I don't get it. I mean, Billy's a pro. She'd know the difference between a real murder and a gag."
andy,"Please, has she even seen a real murder ?"
karen,"That's my point. If what she saw tonight was real, then she has seen the difference, right ?"
andy,"Oh, come on, honey. We all bought the guy cutting me up tonight. Even I believed it."

karen,"You could at least make the effort. Andy stops eating, looks at Billy drinking water and then at Karen."
andy,"Listen... I'm sorry. All I can think about now is the movie, but as soon as we get back, I promise, I'll learn."
karen,How often have I heard that ?
andy,Come on. I can understand some of what she's saying.
karen,What ?
andy,"Okay, how about this ?"
andy,"Means makeup, right ?"
karen,"Wrong. It means somebody's look, the expression on their face."
andy,That was close.
karen,What Billy said she'll never forget the look on the girl's face tonight from the moment she knew she was gonna die. She said the pain and the terror was real. You can't act that.
the reaper,"Come closer, Mr. Hausmann. I won't bite."

andy,"I don't care ? I don't care ? Fine, fine. I'm calling the American Embassy tonight, okay ?"
karen,It's the weekend. They're closed.
andy,"Not for us. My dad gave me the duty officer's direct number before we left, just in case. So say goodbye. He waves to Billy, who waves back to him. She blows a kiss to her sister, who blows one back, and enters her building."
larsen,"Mr. Lovett, these are the two officers who answered the complaint. He shakes hands with the two policemen."
lovett,"Good evening, gentlemen."
first policeman,Good evening.
larsen,"Please speak English to the ambassador's secretary. My chief asked me to meet Mr. Lovett here. If this witness is correct about what she saw tonight, she may help my own investigation."

digital voice,"Hello, this is Billy Hughes speaking."
digital voice,Hello.
digital voice,Hello.
first policeman,Have you seen a... how do you say... snuff film before ?
larsen,"I saw a woman tied to a tree   kept alive while her arms and legs were cut off. It's hard   to talk about it, or even think about it. And it makes   you sick to watch it. You never forget the look in the   victim's eyes. The sheer panic and horror when they realize   they're about to die."
karen,Well ?
andy,I told you. There's nothing to worry about. He says the film's the biggest piece of shit he's ever seen.

larsen,"You know why we call him The Reaper ? You see his face, you die."
andy,"Nice night, isn't it ?"
andy,"I'm just taking a piss. Right, you know, just... The watcher walks slowly down the ladder. Karen reaches the ladder, climbs on something we don't see, and catches the watcher's foot through the steps of the ladder. The man falls and rolls all the way down the ladder. He is unconscious and Andy ties his wrist to the ladder with the handcuff. Karen joins him. Andy seems very happy about the successful operation."
