Speaker,Dialogue
for educational,PURPOSES ONLY  2.  FADE IN:  EXT. STREETS  - DAY  End of the day.     An armored truck moves through the city of Los Angeles.  EXT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAY The armored truck pulls up. An ARMORED TRUCK GUARD emerges from the back with a satchel and heads inside.
6.,"A large, free-standing FISH TANK BUBBLES away. Nearby, CHRISTOPHE is packing to leave town. When... SU  Where are the stones?"
christophe,Fuck off. Wham!   Wham!   Wham!     Wham!   Much more violent than a bitch- slap. CHRISTOPHE I'll tell you. SU I know.
8.,"I'll bet you're a lot more fun than any of those boring people upstairs. Douglas is unaffected.   Just looks at her blankly. DOUGLAS Really, ma'am.   I have a job to do. Daria doesn't understand why he's not interested in her. Then she glimpses Douglas's magazine lying on the desk."
daria's pov,"The magazine is Genre.   Males for males.   Buff boys.   Big pecs, big penises."
fait,This isn't a conversation.    Do it. It's an order.    Tommy knows he has to.   Shit. TOMMY Shit. DARIA Key-card.
10.,"talking on duty. TOMMY Who's talking? Honey, this is a flirting... But you're probably just another good-looking man wasting it all on women. World's full of fools. Beat.   Douglas lets him see the Genre magazine. TOMMY Yahtzee!... Okay, Mr. I-Always-Have- A-Hard-Nightstick. Put away the pictures of those underfed, white males and let's broaden your horizons."
another angle,"As the doors close, Daria shoots a wink back at..."
tommy,who furtively flips her the bird.        Never missing a beat with Douglas.
12.,INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY Fait emerges from the hole beneath the table.
13.,"Miles, the hole drilled, picks up the cylinder he'd had slung over his shoulder. Pulls out a pressurized metal canister of liquid nitrogen. Miles injects the nitrogen into the hole. A CRACKLING sound as the super-low-temp LIQUID spreads out inside the vault door. The outside frosts over. Fait finishes attaching the free ends of the cables to clips on the SAM. Final checks of the rig. FAIT Out."
fait,Go. INTERCUT WITH:
angle back,"Fait turns back to Daria. Signals her to climb up onto the top of the train. Then begins climbing after her. As Fait reaches the driver's window, he sees ANOTHER SWAT COP approaching the train's DRIVER, checking under seats, etc. Fait has to climb fast. The SWAT Guy and the Driver getting closer. Looking up. Just as..."
19.,SU The stones.
miles,You'll have to come and get 'em.
tommy,What the hell happened? Fait puts a finger to his lips.    Leads them across the room to another door.
24.,rethink the no-gun policy. TOMMY Little ass-whuppin's nothing. 'Least you didn't have to play all foxy with the rent-a-cop.
ling,"So this is Mr. Christophe? SONA Yes. Only the handcuffs and fish tank are a new look. LING Apparently we're not his first visitors today. CHRISTOPHE Please, Monsieur Ling -- Ling interrupts him with a hand on the shoulder."
ling,Whatever you're going to say... Make it the truth.
archie,"How about a Marine Corps assault hovercraft? FAIT I got other business. Fait and Archie walk to a work table. Nearby, two MEN UNLOAD HOT TVS from a truck. One Man calls to Archie. MAN UNLOADING HOT TVS We're outta room over here, Arch. ARCHIE Stack 'em in the office, if you have to. Then Archie turns his attention back to Fait. ARCHIE ... You weren't downtown tonight by any chance, were you, Tony? FAIT Don't know what you're talking about. ARCHIE Me either. FAIT Ever see black diamonds before? ARCHIE White, blue, yellow, pink. Neil Diamond. Lou Diamond Phillips. Black diamonds? Solid rocks? No. Whereupon Fait opens the nylon bag and pours the black diamonds out onto the table. Archie pulls out a loup. Studies them a moment. Shrugs. ARCHIE You got me. FAIT Find out how much they're worth. ARCHIE There a timetable on this, or -- FAIT Yesterday. ARCHIE That's what I figured."
fait,Yeah?   Make me an offer. Su stands.
su,You can walk out of here. FAIT ... No deal. Fait launches   himself at Su. Gonna fight     his way    out the door. A much    better fighter than Miles.     And...    He's saved by the bell:    the PHONE RINGS. The fight     stops.     The phone's near   Fait. Beat. The answering      machine    picks up.
29.,LING I don't have time for this. FAIT That your final offer?
ling,"I can be a very dangerous man, Mr. Fait. Fait just hangs up. FAIT Everybody think I'm the fucking Goodwill or something...? Look, I've had a shitty night, and so far, I got zip for all my troubles. So I don't know who the fuck you are, and I don't care. But hear this: you can beat my ass around the block all night -- Brother, it ain't gonna get you those stones. A long beat. The two men facing off. Then... As Su stands aside, giving Fait a clear path out..."
30.,INT./EXT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS ACTION Finally forcing its way through on-coming traffic and speeding down the alley after Fait. The ESCALADE reaches the intersection. Turns. And... CRASHES into a DUMPSTER rolled into its path. The dumpster forces the Escalade into a wall.
31.,"two. Using all means available. During the battle, a killer tries to reach the gun behind the chain-link fence. Almost gets it. When... Two vicious DOBERMANS, guard dogs for the junkyard behind the fence, leap out of nowhere, SNARLING and SNAPPING and smash into the fence. The killer jumps back, barely escaping with his arm. The fight continues.   Fait and Su wear them down. Behind the fence, the Dobies want flesh. Every time someone crashes into the fence, they're right there trying to get a piece. Also, every time someone crashes into the old fence, we see a series of chain-link connections loosen and break. Until it happens one too many times. The entire fence goes down. The dogs are out. The nearest targets: Su and Fait.Su and Fait must now focus their attention on fighting off and evading the ferocious attack dogs. Finally, Su kicks one dog flying. Whip-kicks the other off Fait. The two men run for the Escalade. The dogs are up in a flash. Su spots an abandoned car. A rear door is open. SU Over here. Fait follows, right on his heels. The dogs close in. Su reaches the car. Dives through the open door. Somersaults over the rear seat. Kicks open the far door and rolls out. Fait dives in right behind him. The Dobies leap in after Fait. Fait's airborne completely through the back seat and out the other side of the car. Clears the door. And... Su slams the door shut. We watch a two-Doberman pile-up against the suddenly closed door as Su leaps to the car's other side and shuts that door, too. Trapping the SNARLING, foaming DOGS inside. The bad guys are gone. And Fait's CELL PHONE is RINGING. As Fait digs out the phone, to Su -- FAIT Man, what the hell's up with these fucking stones?  Go."
32.,INTERCUT WITH:
archie,It's Archie.    Bad news.   We got a problem.
33.,FAIT Who are they? ARCHIE Uh... Don't know.
fait,"What'd they say? ARCHIE Well... 'Give us the stones, motherfucker.' You know. That kinda thing. FAIT That's it?"
archie,"Pretty much.    Yeah. FAIT Thanks for keeping yourself alive to pass on all that valuable information. SU Did you call the police? ARCHIE Look around. Are you crazy? Then again, maybe you are crazy, 'cause I have no idea who you are. FAIT Big question is, who's behind the boost? ARCHIE  I don't know that, but I know they got great guns. I can't even get those. U.S. Special Forces only. FAIT ... Chambers. ARCHIE What? FAIT He's wired into everything going down in this city, and he can get that kind of firepower. Gotta be him. SU Who's Chambers?"
fait,"Runs the biggest outfit in town. What warlords are to Afghanistan, Chambers is to L.A... And you want to take him on, you're on your own. Game over for me.  And now that I'm truly fucked -- what the hell are you, anyway? You got some I.D.? Beat.   Su takes out his wallet and shows him."
36.,"gentleman, please? Beat.   Fait hands the phone to Su. FAIT He has my daughter."
archie,"Oh, Jesus... FAIT He wants to talk to you. Su takes the phone.   In CHINESE with ENGLISH SUBTITLES -- SU Hello. LING I thought I killed you. SU I have the stones.      No negotiations. Let the girl go. LING Do you really want one more person to die? We see this resonates with Su. SU No negotiations. And then, he simply hangs up. END INTERCUT. FAIT What'd you just do?     What happened? SU I said I have the stones and won't negotiate for your daughter. FAIT You what? ARCHIE Oh, Jesus... SU It will confuse him.     Buy us time and keep her alive. FAIT"
37.,"What the fuck're you talking about? That asshole has my daughter. SU Look -- I know him.  I want the stones, you want your daughter. We'll get them both back. We'll work together. FAIT ... I gotta work with you? SU You have no choice."
38.,The buyers fly in tomorrow.   Should we stop them? LING We'll never regain their confidence.  We need information. Find the right people. Pay whatever it costs. Something's not right. Something's happening with the stones. SONA What about the girl?
ling,We'll need her... She stays alive. For now.
39.,Mine is fifteen... Boyfriends... FAIT Never happen.    I'll just kill 'em.
su,I wish it were that easy. Another beat.   Then -- FAIT About time I got the 4-1-1. SU 4-1-1?
fait,What's this all about? SU The stones aren't what you think they are. FAIT No shit.  How about the guy who has Vanessa? SU He's exactly what you think he is -- a thief and a killer. FAIT Great...
40.,campground. CHARLES You're sure you cleaned it out? LING THUG #1 Everything except the denture cream and adult diapers. Vanessa's still screaming.   It's getting on Charles' nerves. CHARLES I'm sick of her already. He marches toward the van.   Unlocks the rear door and slides it open.
fait,... Chinese guy. CHAMBERS ... No shoes in my crib.
43.,thief in the night. Stealing what don't belong to you. Chambers turns to Su.   In SUBTITLED KOREAN -- CHAMBERS You like tall white women? Su doesn't say anything.   Back to English -- CHAMBERS He can't talk? SU I don't speak Korean.
44.,"What's worth that kind of trouble, that kind of heat? Gotta be something good. Gotta be something expensive. Beat.   He meets Fait's eyes.   Holds them."
fait,She's my little girl. CHAMBERS Make another one... Lotta offspring running around. Big scores're rare in a lifetime. Another beat.   That's it.   No deal.
45.,"SU In Taiwan, I could force him to talk. FAIT This ain't Taiwan.  Only thing we can do now is find out where the stones are and go take 'em. SU You make it sound easy. FAIT It won't be. They're about to get in the car. Fait stops.     Looks back at the prison. Suddenly realizing something. FAIT ... They're at his club. SU How do you know? FAIT I know. I can feel it.      That ever happen to you? SU No. FAIT I thought Chinese people were all mystical and shit. SU We like to gamble.     Not guess. FAIT It's no guess... But I could be wrong... We'll hit the club. You gotta see Archie. SU Archie? FAIT He's gotta remember something about the guys who took down his place. SU What if he can't? FAIT Pretend it's Taiwan.    Make him remember."
russell,"What are you doing?! CHARLES Whoa. Take it easy. Just seeing if I could help with something. RUSSELL You can't! It's very delicate equipment! Stay away! Just stay away from my truck! CHARLES What? RUSSELL Stay away from my truck! CHARLES What? RUSSELL Stay away from my truck! CHARLES What? Sona's emerging from a trailer/office nearby. SONA Stop it. Charles does. And now we can hear Vanessa, who's begun screaming inside the camper. VANESSA  I want my daddy! Charles backs up, continuing to address Russell --"
charles,"I'm backing away... I'm backing away... VANESSA  I want my daddy! I want my daddy! Sona tosses Charles a roll of duct tape. SONA Tape her up and gag her. As Vanessa continues to SCREAM, Charles moves to the van, unlocks the rear door with the key/remote and pockets it. Then opens the door. And... Vanessa bolts out, crying, and clamps her arms around his waist. VANESSA I want my daddy! I want my daddy!    I want my daddy! CHARLES Get the hell off me. He pries loose her arms from around him. Keeping a grip on her wrists with one hand, Charles turns her around to face away from him. He's about to start duct-taping her wrists. CHARLES ... Waste of time... I can think of a better way of shutting you up -- Vanessa back-kicks him hard in the 'nads.   Charles howls in pain and lets her go. Quickly, Vanessa jumps back inside the camper."
50.,"thought...  Hey, y'know, this is crazy. I don't know what I was thinking. I shouldn't even be here like this. Sorry, Odion."
odion,"Didn't know you thought so. DARIA I always cared for you, Odion. That's why I'm here. ODION ... You looking for a job? DARIA I need something. ODION ... So maybe you could work here. DARIA Here?... Oh, man, I don't know. ODION You were the best. Not many girls pulling in two g's a night. DARIA Yeah, but it's been a while for that... Might not remember how. ODION Just like a bicycle, baby.     You don't forget that stuff. Daria considers it a moment. DARIA Don't know how Jump'd feel about it. Having me back. ODION Hey, you let me worry about Jump,"
51.,"okay?  Meantime, why don't you come on in, and you and me can, y'know, talk some more about it."
su,"How will you recognize him? ARCHIE I didn't see his face.   But I'll know his pinkie ring when I  see it. Ten carats. Round cut with   square mount. Good color and clarity.   I remember thinking what it would  do to my face if he hit me. OFF Su's dubious look, as Archie crams on a baseball hat to help disguise himself..."
53.,"They reach the arena. It's also huge. Packed with men. Hazy with smoke. Loud with betting, cheers and boos. A large, chain-link cage stands at the center of the room. Inside, two battered and bloodied fighters are beating the shit out of each other."
su,"Find the ring. ARCHIE Yeah.    Okay. He looks around.      Lotta African-American males. ARCHIE Could take a little while. As Archie starts moving through the crowd, looking at hands, and Su follows..."
54.,"Daria just stands there a moment, getting her body into the music. Then starts dancing for him. Slow and sexy. And Odion's eating it up."
55.,"their scary-assed foreign bugs over here. Y'know, in their luggage and shit. And then the bugs're getting loose and fucking everything up -- eating all the trees and everything, y'know, making people sick... Anyway, city says we gotta spray to prevent any infestation and possible spread. DOORMAN We're doing business inside. Can't let you just start hosing the place with bug spray. TOMMY Yeah, well, maybe you should at least ask the manager about it. DOORMAN Manager's busy. TOMMY ... Okay. Your call. Just know the city quarantine people'll be here first thing tomorrow. DOORMAN Quarantine people? TOMMY They'll be shutting you down for non- compliance... Peace out. Tommy starts to go. DOORMAN Wait, wait, wait. Tommy stops. DOORMAN City's really gonna come and close us up? TOMMY Quicker'n a Zip-loc. DOORMAN ... You sure you're not fucking with me? TOMMY I'm a licensed exterminator.   Why would I be fucking with you? The Doorman considers it another moment.   Then --"
tommy,"Look. Let's do this. You let me start with a couple small rooms, y'know, offices or something, someplace you don't have customers. Upstairs, so the fumes don't bother anybody. I'll pop off a couple bug bombs, and then we'll do the rest later. How's that? The Doorman considers a moment.     Then -- DOORMAN ... Yeah, okay. Get the bombs, and come on."
tommy,"... Look.   At.   This. DOORMAN Just do your thing and go, bro. TOMMY Roger that. He positions the BUG BOMBS. Then.... PFFFT.     He sets off one. PFFFT. The other. As he goes -- TOMMY Just keep the door closed and be sure to give this shit a full hour before anyone comes in. OFF the closing door..."
57.,EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY Fait and Miles grab gear bags and mobilize. Clip onto ascender/descenders and lower themselves to a second-story window. A window into...
59.,"FAIT I'm telling you, they're here. MILES What're we gonna do?"
fait,"Everyone out. Fait's started searching the room.       Tearing it apart. MILES What about you? FAIT I gotta save Vanessa.     I gotta find 'em. MILES I'm not leaving you. FAIT Yes, you are.    Go.   Now. Someone starts RATTLING the LOCKED DOOR.      Fait doesn't stop. MILES T. Come on, man. They're outside. Give it up. FAIT Shut up and get the fuck outta here! That's an order! Miles hesitates. Fait's unreachable. Chambers' men are trying to break down the door. Miles goes. Out the window. Onto the ascender-descender. And gone."
chambers,"Okay, okay... Ling stops."
chambers,Ain't worth my life... I'll take the five and call it a game.
62.,"The midget RING ANNOUNCER steps in with a mike. RING ANNOUNCER Seven advances, eleven's out... Next up, eight versus twelve. Eight versus twelve. Fighters report to the cage. As Archie and Su continue the search -- ARCHIE You're after the stones, too, huh? No response from Su.   Beat. ARCHIE ... I did some more checking around to see what anyone knows about 'em... Guess who get back to me? My Defense Department connection. Now, I think he's calling me about this surplus F- 14 Tomcat I'm trying to get my hands on. But no. Turns out he's calling to tell me about a rumor outta Taiwan about black stones -- In the ring, we see another bruiser waiting to fight as the midget calls out -- RING ANNOUNCER Number twelve! ARCHIE  -- only they're not jewels -- RING ANNOUNCER Number twelve! ARCHIE They're -- Suddenly, seeing the ""12"" card in Su's hand, a FIGHT CLUB FAN grabs his arm and raises it. Yells out -- FIGHT CLUB FAN Twelve's right here! Su pulls his arm back. FIGHT CLUB FAN I'd be scared of him, too. Su glances into the ring, seeing the BRUISER for the first time. The Bruiser's beckoning."
63.,"BRUISER Let's go, chickenshit! Su waves them off. SU Not today... The catcalls start.    Archie leans into Su. ARCHIE I know it    wasn't the plan. But if you don't    fight, they're gonna toss us out on    our asses. We might never find the    guy."
64.,Not yet. The PARAMEDIC treating him doesn't understand. PARAMEDIC What?
fait,Nothing.
archie,still checking out the hands of African-American men in the crowd. Not making any friends as he does it.
su,Number eight's on his feet.    Moving in again.   When...
archie,"Suddenly, he sees it.    The ring."
su,"dodges number eight again. Then... Sees Archie signaling he's found the guy. And... Gets nailed by number eight. A solid hit. Exciting the crowd and pumping up number eight. Whereupon... Su turns to him and bows. SU You win. Su turns, heads out of the cage. The crowd roaring its disapproval. As... The midget Ring Announcer bars Su's path. RING ANNOUNCER No quitting.    Get back in there. Su moves him aside. The midget resists. Five other waiting fighters come to the midget's aid. Forcing Su back into the cage. Where... It's now Su against them all.  HOT DOG STAND - DAY Daria, Tommy and Miles wait. Two     extreme MOTO-RIDERS dressed in leathers have pulled up    in a truck and gotten out to eat. In the back of the truck     is a motorcycle and a four-wheel ATV. The two men Ogle     Daria. To her -- MOTO-RIDER #1 Looking good. She ignores them.     To each other, so she can hear -- MOTO-RIDER #2 Nice rack. MOTO-RIDER #1 Like the upstairs, like the basement,  66. too. DARIA Shut up, assholes..."
another angle,"Fait runs toward the truck parked by the hot dog stand. To Daria, Miles and Tommy, looking on -- FAIT Get the car.     Stay close. As Daria, Miles and Tommy quickly mobilize, Fait jumps into the bed of the truck. Jumps on the ATV. IGNITION. The Moto-Riders suddenly realize what's happening."
68.,"WHOOOM! Fait's flying. Seventy-plus. Down streets, sidewalks, squeezing through places police cars can't. Over, under, around, through -- doesn't matter. The ATV's fast, strong and maneuverable."
71.,TV ANCHOR  ... Here's a car coming down the exit ramp... We see the police approach the car.
fait,Yeah.   That's what I'm getting. SU The doorman.
fait,"... Where the hell is he?  Everyone stay put. OFF which, as he and Su go --"
su,"... I lost the stones. Ling has them... I don't know where he is... I have no way to find him... What do you want me to do? Under which, the PHONE begins to RING.    And... Fait's too upset to care about answering."
fait,"Okay, baby, okay. Just calm down. Under which, in b.g., Su quickly ends the phone call to his superior. Still in Chinese -- SU I'll call you back. FAIT  Where are you? VANESSA I don't know. I'm in a van inside a big building. They painted the windows. I can't look out. FAIT Try.   Try to see something. Vanessa puts her eye to the window.    Finally finds a small gap in the paint."
vanessa's pov,Few details. Just some chairs and bright green light from Russell's contraption.
77.,VANESSA I see chairs.    And there's green light. Fait repeats for the others' benefit.
fait,You see chairs and green light? Where's the light coming from? VANESSA I can't tell. SU Is it bright?
fait,"The green light, baby -- is it bright? VANESSA Yeah.   Really, really bright. FAIT  It's real bright. VANESSA Daddy, hurry!    I'm scared! FAIT I know, baby.    Just hang in there"
78.,TOMMY What? SU Selling the stones... A dye laser emits green light. He needs it to activate them. MILES What the hell you talking about? DARIA What are these stones? Archie answers it.
archie,"Doomsday in disguise. All eyes go to him. ARCHIE They're some kinda new synthetic plutonium. Small and portable, but mega-powerful. TOMMY This fucker's making bombs? SU Not making them. ARCHIE Yeah, he'd need a big operation for that. Why bother? Just demonstrate the stones work and sell 'em to whichever international scumbag offers the highest bid. He makes millions, they make the bombs, then... 'look out, world.' FAIT ... Okay, so we know what he's up to. How's it get us to Vanessa? Su considers it a moment. SU The buyers will want to arrive and leave quickly... Somewhere private... Accessible by aircraft. FAIT Vanessa said she's inside a big building. Could be a hangar."
79.,"MILES Man, there's dozens of little airports around here. We'd never get to 'em all. SU ... Flight plans. ARCHIE Hey, yeah. Flight plans show destinations. All aircraft file 'em with the Aviation Administration. If we could get a list, we could maybe figure out where the sale's going down."
fait,"... Daria, call the aviation people. Use our L.A.P.D. credentials. We need flight plan info for all private aircraft in this area tonight... Everyone else get ready to move... Miles, the no-gun policy's revoked. You break out the heat... Tommy, you gotta get us a diversion. ARCHIE I can help with that. FAIT ... Do it all fast."
80.,consummate satisfaction suddenly spreads across his face. LING ... But it's a lot of money... Beat.   He puts down the stone.    A glance at the camper.
ling,Be ready to kill the girl and go as soon as the sale's over.
82.,Both. FAIT  ... Yeah... Let's get it all.
russell,... New World Order. As the buyers absorb this...
84.,We'll take that. FRENCH BUYER Six at one-five. Silence.
egyptian buyer,Ten at two million. Silence.
85.,there fast. DARIA I'll keep her safe.
russian buyer,"Eight at three. Silence. FRENCH BUYER Nine at three. Silence. EGYPTIAN BUYER Ten at three-one. SONA We'll take that... There are now thirty-seven stones available. And now, in more and more rapid-fire succession -- AFRICAN BUYER Five at three-five. PAKISTANI BUYER Eight at three-five. FRENCH BUYER Twenty at three."
miles,is already sighted in.   PULLS the TRIGGER.   PHUT!
sentries,"One Ling killer takes a leg hit and goes down. Before the second killer has time to react, he catches a BULLET in the shoulder."
miles,MILES Done.
fait,Tommy and Archie. Watch out for the camper. Punch it.
87.,Russell watches the advancing tank. RUSSELL I knew it!   I knew it!
vanessa's pov,Charles is drawn away by the advancing tank.
vanessa,"reaches a button for opening and closing the giant hangar doors. She jabs a button, and the nearest door begins to motor open."
charles,hears the OPENING HANGAR DOOR.    Turns.   Sees Vanessa and goes after her.
miles,SHOOTS again.   PHUT!
charles,"The BULLET RICOCHETS off the PAVEMENT right next to him. In a flash, he's up and running. Heading out into the darkness of the airfield after Vanessa. Meanwhile, back inside..."
89.,"TOMMY I said don't move, motherfucker! Russell just keeps going. Slides open the side door in the back of the five-ton, revealing... A twin-fifty machine gun. Two barrels, .50 caliber. Dangerous even for a tank. Russell vaults in and takes aim. RUSSELL Fucking amateurs! He starts FIRING. People start running. .50 CAL. ROUNDS take big CHUNKS out of whatever they hit. TOMMY Shit!   What do we do?"
archie,Shoot back! TOMMY How? The question's answered for him.   He somehow does the right thing. And... Tommy's MACHINE GUN begins RIPPING CHUNKS out of the FIVE- TON and EVERYTHING near it. Tommy's a horrible shot; the gun's more in control of him. But... Russell finally dies under a HAIL of HEAVY LEAD. ARCHIE Twin .50's some major firepower. How'd that little shit get one? TOMMY Motherfucker.    Couldn't fucking listen. INTERCUT WITH which...
across hangar,"Ling and Sona are moving toward the limo. Ling has the stones. When... Su is there. Blocking the way. Sona attacks. Su easily blocks the counters. Knocking Sona back. Never taking his eyes off Ling. When... Sona, who's fallen back against a buyer's bodyguard, quickly takes the bodyguard's small, full-auto SCORPION and turns the gun on Su. Su dives for cover as the BURST SHREDS the AREA where he'd just been standing. As Sona continues hunting Su... Su sees"
90.,"Ling getting into the limo.    To Archie and   Tommy, as he signals -- SU Don't let him get away!"
limo,"Ling's trying to drive out, when the .30 CAL. SLUGS PUNCH HOLES in the LIMO. The tank keeps coming. Ling bails out as the TANK CRUSHES the LIMO. INTERCUT WITH which..."
charles,The BULLET knocks his gun from his hands.    Charles is slowed but keeps going.
miles,"sweeps the rifle, looking for Charles and Vanessa.     He comms Fait. MILES Lost 'em behind the gas truck."
charles,"stops behind the gas truck.   Looks around for Vanessa.    No sign of her. Until... Charles notices the door to the gas truck isn't closed all the way. He whips it open. And... There's Vanessa, hiding inside. Charles grabs her.   Yanks her out struggling and kicking. CHARLES Time to end this my way. And then... FAIT  Drop the girl."
miles,comms Fait. MILES No shot.
93.,"FAIT Don't move. Fait jumps to his feet. Swinging the chocks. Not quite like nunchakus; more like a medieval mace. And now, all of Fait's fury comes pouring out as he uses the chocks to beat the living shit out of Charles. Charles tries to fight back, but he's out-matched by the chocks and Fait's emotion. The punishing blows land like Thor's hammer. Until... A mighty swing nearly takes Charles' head off. Charles is unconscious before he hits the ground. Fait stands over Charles. Tosses the chocks down. FAIT Wrong kid.    Wrong dad."
94.,"EXT. AGUSTA As the chopper transfers to forward motion, Su struggles to get a foot hooked on something, anything. In the process, he kicks against the helo's sleek underbelly."
ling,To the pilot -- LING Retract the gear!
su,"The gear begins to retract. Disappearing into the bottom of the chopper. In a second, there'll be nothing left to hold. SU Shoot it down!   Now! And then... Su lets go.      Drops fifteen feet to the ground. As... Behind him, having clanked out of the hangar, the Abrams tank is stopped. The turret swivels toward the Agusta."
sky,The Agusta's tail is BLOWN AWAY by the CANNON SHELL.
96.,"You were lucky last time.   You Won't be lucky again. The final fight begins. The two martial arts masters battle in the circle of fire, using everything they can lay their hands on. Each the equal of the other. Each knowing it's a fight to the death. For a long time, the fight could go either way. Until... Ling gets an arm around Su's neck. Like Charles, Su thrashes and flails. Like Charles, he can't get away. LING I'll kill you fast.    You won't Feel a thing."
su,"... I won't.    You will What happens next happens in an instant: Su breaks the hold. Hooks one of Ling's arms.   Wrenches it. A direction it can't go. Ling's ARM BONES SNAP, TISSUES RIP.
