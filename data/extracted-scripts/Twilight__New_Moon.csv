Speaker,Dialogue
bella,Edward!
bella,Edward!
bella,... Gran?
bella,Stop - she'll see!
bella,Oh my God.
edward,Happy birthday.
charlie,"Happy birthday, Bells."
bella,"Dad, we agreed, no gifts."
charlie,At least mine's not wrapped.
bella,"Okay, this is actually kind of great. Thanks, Dad."
charlie," Goes with this one from your mom. We coordinated - well, she coordinated me."
charlie,"To put your pictures in, record your senior year -- man, senior year. How'd you get so old so fast?"
bella,Not that old.
charlie,I don't know. Is that a wrinkle?
charlie,I was kidding.
bella,"So not funny, Dad."
mike,You finish the Shakespeare assignment?
jessica,"He means will you finish his assignment? MIKE No, I don't -- okay I do."
bella,I can help you with it -- but first --  I need a picture. My mom's expecting a scrapbook full of memories.
angela," I take `em, I don't pose for `em."
bella,You do today.
jessica,"You'll photoshop my nose if it looks big, right?"
eric,"Don't worry, I'm in the picture; no one will be looking at you guys."
bella,Don't remind me.
bella,It's one year older than you.
edward,"Bella, I'm ninety."
bella,True. Maybe I should be creeped out that I'm dating such an old guy.
bella,"God, Jacob, what are they feeding you on that rez, steroids? You're huge."
jacob,Wouldn't seem so drastic if you came around more.
bella,"I will, soon. But isn't your school, like, ten miles that way?"
jacob," Oh, and hey, happy birthday. Your dad told my dad. So..."
bella,"This, I need. It's great."
edward,The bell's about to ring.
bella,"Bye, Jake, and thank you."
edward,How come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't?
bella,He's just a friend.
edward,"""Friends"" don't spend two weeks looking for the perfect dreamcatcher."
bella,Stop reading his mind if he bothers you so much.
edward,Little hard to tune out.
alice,Happy --
bella,Shh!
alice,-- birthday.
bella,"Alice, didn't I say no gifts?"
alice,You did. I didn't. I've already seen you open it and guess what? You love it.
bella,You had a vision about my birthday.
alice,And about the green dress you'll be wearing to your party tonight. Great color on you.
romeo,"Arms, take your last embrace, and lips, O you, the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss..."
romeo,Here's to my love!  O true apothecary!    Thy drugs are quick.
bella, Juliet's alright... if you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing.
edward,"Not the girl - the suicide.  Nearly impossible for my kind. But humans, a little poison, dagger to the heart. There are so many options."
bella, Why would you even think about that?
edward, I considered it. Once.      When James had you trapped.
edward,I didn't know if I'd find you in time. If I'd gotten you killed --
bella,It wouldn't have been your fault --
edward,"Either way, I had a plan.  BELLA What plan?  EDWARD There are... ways for us. At least one way. I would have gone to Italy, provoked the Volturi...  BELLA The who?  MR. BERTY Is there something you'd like to share with the class, Edward?  EDWARD  The closest thing my world has to royalty... "
edward,Francesco Solimena painted this; he often depicted the Volturi as Gods.
bella,Is that... Carlisle?
edward,Yes. He lived with them for a few decades. He describes them as very refined - for killers.
bella,Don't even -- talk about that. You can't let anyone hurt you. The Volturi or anyone else.
edward,"Victoria? Yes, some day. But Alice will see her coming. And she won't win."
bella,I hate that I can't protect you.
bella,That was me being serious.
edward, You give me a reason to stay... un- dead. But it's... my job; to protect you...
alice,It's time it's time it's time!
esme,"Like that's even possible.   Happy birthday, Bella."
alice, Found it in your bag.   Mind?
emmett,Dating an older woman.    Hot.
emmett,What?
rosalie,It's a necklace. Alice picked it out.
alice,For your scrapbook.    Now open your presents!
bella,"Alice, I'm the only one who even eats cake. That thing could feed fifty."
alice,"Hope you're hungry.    Here, this one's from Emmett. The others crowd around... Jasper somewhat away. Bella, no fan of being the center of attention, opens the gift to find an empty car-radio box."
bella,Um... thanks?
emmett,Already installed it in your truck.
edward,"Finally, a decent sound system in that piece of --"
bella,"No hating on the truck.     Thank you, Emmett."
alice,Open mine.
bella,Ouch - paper cut.
alice, Jaz... shhh --
carlisle,"Emmett, get Jasper out of here.  Emmett."
carlisle,I'll have to stitch this up.
edward,I'll carry her to the kitchen.
carlisle,"I'll take care of her, Edward.  Check on Jasper. Go."
bella,Your giving me forever.
edward, I won't be coming back.   Not tonight.
bella,Edward.   You're here.
edward,Walk with me?
edward,We need to leave Forks.
edward,It's time. Carlisle's supposed to be ten years older than he looks; people will start noticing.
bella,But... when?
edward,Now.
bella,-- I belong with you --
edward,-- You don't --
bella,-- I'm coming --
edward,I don't want you to come!
edward,"I promise, it will be like I never existed. Goodbye, Bella. And here, for the first time, we SEE how truly agonizing this really is for Edward. But Bella doesn't see."
bella,-- Wait --
bella,Edward?!
charlie,I'll call the Cullens again. Her note said she and Edward went for a walk.
billy,"They left town, Charlie. HARRY CLEARWATER Hospital said Doc Cullen got a big job somewhere else."
jacob,Charlie!
billy,It's Sam Uley. He found her.
charlie,"Thank you, Sam. Thank God."
charlie,"What were you thinking, Baby?   Why were you out there?"
bella,He's... gone.
carlisle,No.   We promised Edward.
alice,"But she won't do well without us. I get flashes of her, but they're unclear --"
rosalie,"Forget her, let's drag Edward home."
esme,He'll come back when he's ready. After Bella moves on.
jasper, You mean safe from us.
rosalie, And when will that be?
emmett,"Can you see him, Alice? They all turn to Alice... a beat. She closes her eyes, trying to get a lock on Edward -- PUSH IN ON ALICE as --"
alice,The only decision he's made...
charlie,"It's about time you got rid of those, Bob. Seen one too many bikers smeared on the highway."
bob,"Save the lecture, Chief. Soon as the garbage truck hauls `em off, you and my wife can rest easy.  Oh, hey, what's the word on that bear problem? Folks are saying they're huge."
charlie, That's just... talk...
bob,"How you doin' there, Bella?"
charlie,That's it.
bella,That's what?
charlie,You're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother. BELLA What?   Why?
charlie,I just - don't know what to do any more. You don't act like someone left you; more like someone died.
bella,I'm not leaving Forks.
charlie,"Bells, the bastard's not coming back."
bella,I like my old friends.
charlie,You never even see them anymore.
bella,"I do, too. In fact, I'm... um... Jessica and I are going to Port Angeles tomorrow. Shopping."
charlie, You hate shopping.
bella,That's how good a friend I am.
charlie, Alright. Shopping.
bella,"... Yes, Bella Swan. Hey, any chance you feel like shopping tomorrow?"
bella,I bought something.
jessica,"Socks don't count. `Course, I was surprised you even called."
bella,I've been kind of... out of it.
jessica,"Kind of? I mean, at first I was worried. Then I'm like, okay, she's still bumming? It's not like I wasn't going through things, too. Like Mike deciding he wanted to ""just be friends?"" That was really hard and --"
bella,I know them... I think...
jessica,Can we just go --
bella,I want to see something.
edward,"Turn around, Bella.     This is dangerous."
bella,... You're not them.
jessica,What the hell is wrong with you?!
bella, I... saw something. JESSICA You.   Are insane. Or suicidal.
jessica,"So, what, you're like an adrenaline junky now? Go hang-gliding or bungie- jumping. Don't be a complete freak."
jacob,`Bout time you came by.
bella,I brought you something.
jacob,Scrap metal. You shouldn't have.
bella,"I rescued them from the dump. They'd cost more than they're worth to fix... unless one had a mechanic-type friend. JACOB Me, being the mechanic-type friend?  Since when are you into motorcycles?"
bella,Recently.
jacob, The parts alone will be pricey.
bella,I have a college fund I can dig into.
jacob,Charlie's gonna love that.
bella,Charlie won't know.
jacob,Wow. Lying to Dad. Blowing through college money. Repairing dangerous machines - that I'm guessing you'll want to ride?
bella,I really get it if you think this is stupid and reckless. JACOB Oh it's totally stupid and reckless.  When do we start?
tim,We're going the wrong way.
nate,Who cares?   Enjoy the scenery.
tim, And the West Nile virus.
tim,You hear that?
nate,"If I knew you were such a wuss, I'd have brought my grandma."
tim,Could be one of those giant bears. NATE There are no giant --
tim,What the hell is that?!
nate,I don't know!
tim,Think it's gone?
jacob,You influence me?     Please.
bella,I am older than you.
jacob,Age ain't nothin' but a number.
bella,And I convinced you to secretly build us two-wheeled death machines.
jacob," Yo, Jake, you in there?"
jacob,"It's cool, it's just my boys."
embry,"Hey, Jake --"
jacob,"Hey. This is Bella.         Bella, that's Quil and Embry."
quil,So the bike building story is true.
bella,Taught him everything he knows.
quil,"What about the part where you're his girlfriend? BELLA Oh, we're just friends."
jacob, I said she's a girl and a friend.
quil,"Embry, you remember him making that distinction?"
embry,Nope.
bella,So I guess you guys have girlfriends. JACOB  Right. Quil took his cousin to prom.
quil,"Yeah, that's still a riot. You want funny, Black? I'll give you funny."
embry,I got five bucks on Quil.
bella,You're on.
jacob,Quil keeps asking to come over. I think he likes you a little too much.
bella,Tell him I'm not into the cougar thing.
jacob,"What is it with you and age? I mean, that Cullen guy was young, didn't seem to... bother you."
jacob,We got lucky at the dump. You know how much a new crankshaft goes for?
bella,"Sure, I spend all my free time on crankshaft-dot-com."
jacob,I think that's a porn site.  These bikes are gonna be rolling soon. Where should we ride first?
jacob,Like there's any place sunny around here.
bella,I know a place above the cloud line --
jacob,"So we'll find our sunny spot, right?"
bella,Isn't that... Sam Uley?
jacob, And his cult.
jacob,"They're not really fighting, Bella. They're cliff diving."
bella,"What, on purpose?"
jacob,"Scary as hell, but a total rush."
jacob,Most of us jump from lower down.
bella,Think I could?
jacob,"Man, first motorcycles, now cliff diving?"
bella,You said it was a rush.
jacob,Maybe on a warmer day. And not from the top. We'll leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples.
bella,You don't like them.
jacob,"They think they run this place.   Acting all bad ass, calling themselves ""protectors."""
bella,What are they protecting?
jacob,"The tribe, the land, their right to be jerks. Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids; now look at him."
bella,That's Embry? I didn't recognize him. What happened to him?
jacob,"He missed some school - then, out of nowhere, he's following Sam around. Same thing happened with Paul and Jared. They weren't even friends, now Sam owns them.  Sam keeps giving me this look, like he's waiting for me or something; it's kinda freaking me out."
bella,Maybe you should just avoid them.
jacob,I try but...
bella,"Hey.   If it gets worse, we'll go to my Dad.   Or you can come stay with us."
jacob,"Thanks.  If this is how you're going to react, I'll freak out more often."
jessica,I'll kill Tyler if he gave me his flu.
angela,It's going around. My sister was so sick she couldn't come on our hike this weekend... so she didn't see it.
angela, ... We saw it.
bella,You're not the only one. Everyone stares.    Did Bella just speak?
bella,My dad's been getting reports at the sheriff's station. A couple hikers went missing. People are scared.
mike,I did hear some guy talking about it at the store.
cut to:,ECU ON JACOB AND BELLA'S FACES
jacob,You look scared.
bella,I'm not.
jacob,Brake?  You ready?
jacob,"You okay?   Bruises, breaks -- ?"
bella,I'm going again.
jacob,I'm not sure that's a good -- Bella quickly rises and hops back on.
jacob,Guess we're going again. Now what are you going to do with the clutch?
bella,Release it.    Slowly.
bella, I don't -- how do I turn!?
jacob,Bank it!   Bank - hit the brake!
jacob,"What, are you training for the X-games?"
bella,I want to go again.
jacob,"Forget it. I'm revoking your motorcycle privileges. Man, look at your head."
jacob,"It's just blood, Bella."
jacob,How hard did you hit your head?
bella,More than anyone.    But... that's all.
jacob,Because of Cullen?
jacob,"Look, I know what he did to you. I can see it in your face every time his name comes up. But you need to know - I would never, ever do that to you. I promise I will never hurt you. You can count on me. BELLA I already do. You don't know how much. You're my best friend but... I don't think my feelings will change."
bella,I'm sorry. I should've said something right from the start --
jacob,No. That's not -- I just feel... weird.
jacob,It doesn't... feel like flu.    I don't know what it is.
bella,Jacob.   Please. Call me.
charlie,Harry and I will be back by three --
bella,He's too sick to even call?
charlie,"You just gotta wait it out.  You know, I don't have to go fishing..."
bella," No, go. I'll call Jess or someone."
charlie,"Good. But stay here or at Jess's. No hikes or anything. We're issuing a warning about those bears.  Off Bella's nod --  EXT. THE WOODS - DAY  SERIES OF CUTS - Bella tries to navigate her way to the meadow. She refers to a map, a compass.  BELLA  - DAY  -- Bella steps into the clearing, hopeful... but her face falls. In contrast to the warmth of her memory, the meadow is cold, gloomy, cloudy. And no Edward. She closes her eyes, trying to force Edward here.  Nothing.   Her eyes open on the empty, overcast meadow.  Bella sinks to her knees. Tears threatening. But then she hears a RUSTLING noise. She turns toward it, peers into the woods.  Another RUSTLING NOISE comes from another part of the woods. She spins toward it -- nothing. Then she turns and JUMPS when she finds --  Vampire LAURENT standing just ten yards away.    Dreadlocks, chiseled face. Bella can't believe it. "
bella,Laurent?
laurent,"I must admit, I didn't expect to find you here."
bella,I live here. But you - I thought you were in Alaska with Carlisle's friend.
laurent,"Tanya, I was. It was kind of him to arrange, given my association with James and Victoria, ""The Enemy."""
bella,You tried to help us.
laurent,"I went to visit the Cullens, but their house is empty. I'm surprised they left you behind. Weren't you sort of a pet of theirs?"
laurent,Do the Cullens visit often?
edward,Lie.
bella,Absolutely.    All the time.
edward,Lie better.
bella,I'll tell them you stopped by.
bella,Will they be able to reach you in Alaska?
laurent,"I don't think so. Tanya's ""vegetarian"" family was pleasant enough. But the dietary restrictions were difficult - living on nothing but animals."
laurent,But that's not why I left. I came back here as a favor to Victoria.
bella,... You're still friends.
laurent," More or less. She asked me to get the lay of the land with the Cullens. Because, well... I'm afraid Victoria is quite put out with you."
bella,That's... too bad.
laurent,"Yes. She feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate, given he killed hers. Eye for an eye, mate for a mate."
edward,Threaten him.
bella,Edward will know who did it.   He'll come after both of you.
laurent,"I don't think he will. After all, how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected?  Victoria sent me here for information. She won't be happy about my killing you. BELLA No, Laurent..."
laurent,I... don't believe it.
edward,Don't.   Move.
charlie,Bella?   What's wrong?
bella,They're not giant bears -- I saw them. Up in a meadow --
charlie,"Damn it, I told you not to go into the woods!"
harry clearwater,"What did you see, Bella?"
bella,"Wolves.   They're wolves, Dad."
charlie,"Harry, can you get some men from the rez?"
harry clearwater,Sure.   Yeah. I'll just --
charlie, Something dangerous. Victoria.
bella,"Hi, Billy.   I know Jacob's sick but --"
billy,He's out with friends. BELLA  Oh.
billy,I'll let him know you came by.
bella,"Wait -- he's got mono, right?    That's what you told my dad."
billy," You should go on home, Bella."
bella,You cut your hair.
jacob,Go away.
bella,What happened to you?
bella, I can help.
bella,Sam got to you. What did he do?
jacob,"Sam's trying to help me, don't blame him."
bella,"Then who? JACOB  How `bout those filthy, reeking bloodsuckers you love? The Cullens."
jacob,"I can't be friends with you anymore. BELLA Jake, I know I hurt you. I should have been more up-front but -- I needed you, I still do. I don't know what that means yet, but if you give me time --"
jacob,Stop.    Don't. It's not you --
jacob,You already have --
bella,Don't say that -- you promised --
jacob,"Go home, Bella. Don't come back."
charlie,"Billy called, said you and Jacob had a fight. But, hey, you guys will work it out, I'm sure of it."
bella,I'm... going to change.
bella,Why!?
bella,What the hell are you doing?
jacob,Get out of the way.
bella,No! He launches himself THROUGH the window with great agility --
jacob,I had to talk to you.   Alone.
bella,Then leave.
bella,Find what out? He starts to speak -- but can't.   It's agonizing.   She sees he's in pain. Is concerned.
jacob,"No, that's too dangerous --"
bella,"I'll take the risk.    Jacob, show me."
jacob,Where was the last place you saw me... the way I used to be?
bella,"The motorcycles - that clearing in the woods. He nods slowly, then turns to go.    She stops him."
paul,What the hell have you done?!
jacob,I didn't tell her.   You'd know if I did.
paul,"She's here, isn't she?"
sam,"Bella, there's nothing to see here. You should go home."
bella,Not until I know what you did to Jacob.
paul, What we did?!
sam,"Both of you, calm down --"
jacob,"Sam, she knows things about the bloodsuckers. She's been on the inside. She can help --"
paul,Like a leech lover's gonna help us.
jacob,Watch what you call her.
embry,"Get a grip, guys --"
bella,"It's alright, Jacob, I'll go --"
paul,"All you care about is her -- SAM  Paul, back off."
paul,-- and she doesn't give a crap about you --
sam,Jacob.
jared,Too late.
sam,Take Bella to Emily's place.
embry,Guess the wolf's out of the bag.
embry,"Oh, hey, about Emily - Sam's fiance - just try not to stare. It bugs Sam."
bella,Why would I stare? --
emily,"You guys hungry? Like I have to ask... Emily looks toward them now -- REVEALING the other side of her face: A scar runs from hairline to chin, three red lines that pull down her eye and twist her mouth."
emily,Who's this?
jared,Bella Swan.    Who else?
emily,So you're the vampire girl.
sam,"Hey, Em."
embry,"Ha!   Pay up. As Jared reluctantly hands Embry five bucks, Jacob's eyes find Bella's. He nods solemnly to the door; we should talk."
bella," Vampires? Jake, no --"
jacob," Don't worry, we can't touch your precious Cullens - unless they bite someone and violate the Treaty --"
bella,That's not what I -- you can't fight vampires. They're too dangerous.
jacob,Please. We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough.
jacob,"It's what we do, why we exist. A few ""lucky guys"" in the tribe have the gene. If a bloodsucker moves to town, our DNA kicks in, we reach the right age and the fever hits --"
bella," ""Mono."""
jacob,"I wish. Next thing I know, they're telling me, this is your life now. That future you saw for yourself? Gone."
bella,"It's bad, huh?"
jacob,I just hate feeling... out of control. Like maybe Sam is right; you shouldn't be around me.
bella,Like you could get rid of me.
jacob,You've seen Emily.
bella,"You're not like that. You save people, right? You saved me from Laurent."
jacob,"Yeah, didn't mind taking him out. His red-headed girlfriend will be fun, too."
bella,Victoria.     She's here?
jacob,We chased her all the way to the border the other night. But she won't stay gone. Keeps coming back -- if we knew what she was after...  ... What?
bella,I know what she wants.      Me. SMASH TO:
victoria,"James hated cars. He liked being close to the ground. But I'd steal one occasionally, to throw him off the scent... See, we played hide and seek sometimes. No one can hide like me --  -- but no one could seek like James."
denise,What -- what are you -- ? VICTORIA Some games   lasted months... but we always got   hungry for each other.  So I'd let   him find me...
denise,Michael?    Oh my God --
victoria,We never could get enough of each other...  We would have had forever to try.
victoria,James always loved a screamer.
jared,"Excellent. If the redhead's after Bella, we've got bait."
jacob,She is not bait.
bella,I should leave town.
sam,Victoria will follow you and make it harder for us to catch her.
charlie,"You got something, Harry?"
harry clearwater,"Nope, nothin'."
bella,Yes!
jacob,"Breathe, Bella! C'mon!"
jacob,Bella?   Can you hear me?
bella,"... Jake? She focuses, finally SEES Jacob hovering over her, relieved. Behind him stands Sam."
sam,She'll be alright.
jacob,What the hell were you thinking?
bella,I needed... to see... something.
jacob,What? The pearly gates?   If we hadn't heard you scream --
sam,Get her home. I'm heading to the hospital. I'll meet you there.
jacob,Why would you jump? Didn't you notice it's like a hurricane out here?
bella,I know. It was stupid --  -- Sam said hospital - someone's hurt?
jacob,Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.
bella,Oh my God - does my Dad know?
jacob,He and my dad are both over there.
bella,Will Harry be okay?
jacob,I don't know. Come on. I'll find you something dry and drive you home.
jacob,Hundred and eight degrees over here.
bella,"Must be nice, never getting cold."
jacob,It's a wolf thing.
bella," Yeah, `cause that would be fun."
bella,I won't let that happen.
jacob,Holy crap -- !
jacob,There's a bloodsucker out there.
bella,How do you know?
jacob,"I can smell the stink.   I'm getting you out of here. As Jacob whips the truck around, the HEADLIGHTS ILLUMINATE --"
bella,Stop!   It's not Victoria --
jacob,Forget it --
bella,It's Carlisle's car!   They're here. Go back! --
jacob,It's a trick --
jacob,"Damn it, Bella --"
jacob,Stop.   You gotta come with me. BELLA It's okay.   They're my friends --
jacob,"Don't you get it? If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory. The Treaty says we can only defend our own lands."
bella,-- It's not a war --
jacob,It is. And you'll only be safe in La Push. I can't protect you here anymore.
bella,I don't need you to --
jacob,-- You're about to cross a line -- BELLA Only if you draw one.
jacob,"Bye, Bella, I hope you don't die."
bella,Alice! ALICE You're... alive.
bella,"Oh my God, Alice.    You're here."
alice,I heard voices - I didn't think it was you but - you're alive.
bella,You keep saying that.
alice,I saw you - a vision of you - you jumped off a cliff. I knew I'd be too late but --  Why the hell would you try to kill yourself?!
bella,I didn't.    I was cliff diving.
alice,Why?!
bella,Um... fun?
alice,That was fun for you.
bella,Until I hit the water.
alice,I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy... and what is that hideous wet dog smell?
bella,Oh. Probably Jacob.      He's kind of a werewolf.
bella,Werewolves are not vicious.
alice,Until they lose their tempers.
bella,"They saved me from Laurent, they're protecting me from Victoria --"
alice, Victoria? I didn't see her. I didn't see you get pulled from the water either.
bella,It was Jacob who saved me. More than once. I couldn't have made it without him. You have no idea what it was like.
alice," Yes. I do. I knew leaving wouldn't be good for you. I tried to tell Edward, but he wouldn't listen."
bella, ... Does he know you're here?
alice,No.   He's been... away...
edward,What?
edward,I'm hanging up now...
rosalie,"Wait!... You should come home.  Esme's a wreck, Carlisle never smiles. Even Emmett's depressed. You've really done a number on them."
rosalie,I... I just miss... us.   The family.
rosalie,"But see, you don't have to worry about that, not anymore --"
edward,"Why, Rose?   Did something happen?"
rosalie,I - uh --
edward,"Tell me, Rosalie.  Tell me! --"
rosalie," -- Alice had a vision. She saw Bella - - throw herself off a cliff... She's dead, Edward."
charlie,"Thanks for understanding, Bells. They wanted to keep the service small."
bella,Don't worry about me.    Are you gonna be okay?
charlie,"Yeah... but Sue, and those kids -- Leah's only a year older than you. And Seth's, what, fourteen..."
charlie,"There'll be a reception after. I might stay late, see if I can help."
alice,You're not going?
bella,I'm not the most popular person on the werewolf rez right now.
alice, Because you're friends with me.
alice,Huh. Didn't see them coming. Didn't see him pull you out of the water - maybe my visions are allergic to dogs.
bella,-- Alice.
alice, I'll go do some hunting.
bella,"Quil... you, too?"
quil," Yeah. Me, too."
jacob,You alone?
bella,Yes.   Shouldn't you be at the funeral?
jacob,Had to talk to you first.  I'll meet you there. Go on.
jacob,This place stinks to hell.
bella,You're welcome to leave.      In fact --
jacob,-- How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying?
bella, Just Alice. And she'll stay as long as she wants.
jacob,Are the rest coming back?
bella,Not that I'm aware of.      Anything else?
jacob,That's it.
bella,Better go report to Sam.
jacob,I've done it again. I keep breaking my promise not to hurt you.
bella,It doesn't have to be this way.
jacob,"Yeah, it does."
bella,"Am I gonna lose you this time, Jacob?"
bella,"Alice, what's wrong?"
alice,... Edward.
bella,What about him? What happened?
alice,I just saw him in a vision.   He... thinks you're dead.
jacob,Why do you have to go?
bella,He won't believe Alice.    He has to see that I'm alive.
jacob," He left you, Bella. He didn't want you anymore, remember?"
bella,"But I still love him, and I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt. This wounds him. But she can't stop to soothe him.         She pulls away and continues packing."
jacob,What about your dad?
bella,"I'm eighteen, legally free to go. I'll leave a note."
alice,Got the airline tickets.
jacob, You Cullens might hunt animals but those monsters in Italy don't.
alice,I'm well aware what the Volturi are. JACOB Then why are you taking Bella to them like a bottle of wine to a party?
alice,"Right, she's better off here with Victoria stalking her. The one you dogs can't seem to catch?"
bella,Let's go.
jacob,"Please, Bella. Stay here.   For Charlie... for me."
bella,"Bye, Jacob."
alice,Maybe Jacob's right.  No. You need to realize - the Volturi could easily see me as Edward's accomplice. And you're a human who knows too much and tastes too good. They could kill us all.
edward,Have you decided?
aro,It was an intriguing debate.     We don't get many suicidal vampires.
caius,Pathetic.
aro,"I'm afraid your gifts are too valuable to destroy. But if you're unhappy with your lot, join us. We'd be delighted to utilize your skills."
edward,So you won't end this.
marcus,Not without cause.
aro,Such a waste.
bella,Where'd you get the car?
alice,Hope you're not opposed to grand theft auto.
bella,Not today.
bella,How much time do we have.
bella, It's almost noon now.
alice,There's Volterra.
bella,Why are they all wearing red?
alice,San Marcos Day festival. The perfect setting. Large crowds. The Volturi won't let him get far enough to reveal himself - he's counting on that.
bella,We only have five minutes --
bella,Where's the square?
alice,Follow that lane --
alice,He'll be under the clock tower!
italian man,Fare attenzione!
bella,"Edward! -- -- GONG! Bella's cry is drowned out by the BOOMING CHIME. She pushes toward him, fighting to reach him as --"
bella,"No, Edward!    Don't!"
edward, You're... not real.
bella,Look at me!    Alice was wrong.
edward,Bella?
bella,"Please, step back.   I'm alive, I'm --"
edward,You're here.
bella,"I'm here. They share a long look, he's about to kiss her again... when suddenly, he stiffens -- and abruptly PUSHES Bella behind him, taking a protective stance in front of her --"
edward,"I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen."
felix,Aro wants to speak with you again.
edward,No rules were broken.
demetri,We should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue.
edward,"Fine. Bella, why don't you stay and enjoy the festival?"
felix,The girl comes with us.
edward,That's not going to happen --
alice,"Come on, guys, it's a festival."
edward, Jane.
bella, Just do as she says.
jane,Follow me.
edward,It's alright. Alice will catch you.
gianna,Buon pomeriggio.
aro,What a happy surprise! Bella is alive after all. Isn't that wonderful?
aro,Her blood appeals to you so much it makes me thirsty. How can you stand to be so close to her?
edward,It's not without effort.
aro, I can see that.
edward,One touch and Aro can see every thought I've ever had in my life.
aro,"You're quite the telepath yourself, Edward. Though... you can't read Bella's thoughts. Fascinating."
aro,Interesting.
aro,I wonder if --
aro,"Jane, dear.    The girl?"
aro,Remarkable! She confounds us all.      So what do we do with you now?
aro,"That's true. Unless Edward intends to give her immortality...  But that's not your intention, is it. Shame."
bella,"Do it!    Kill me! Just leave them alone! -- as she yanks her collar back, exposing her neck to him. Aro is surprised and intrigued. A beat."
aro,Enough.
edward,Get away from her -- !
aro,"Ah yes, the clairvoyant. I saw your gift in Edward's thoughts. What is it you've seen? EDWARD ... don't..."
alice,"It will happen, Aro.   See for yourself."
aro,"Mesmerizing! To see the things you've seen, that haven't happened yet!"
alice,I'm so sorry.
aro, Your gifts will make for an intriguing immortal. Go make your preparations.
demetri," Nice fishing, Heidi, save some for me."
heidi," This way, please. Stay together..."
tourist husband,"Unusual tour, isn't it? TOURIST WIFE Bill, get a picture of that bust there."
bella,-- Stop!
bella,It... wasn't a dream.
edward,Go back to sleep. You've been through a lot.
edward,Will you? I don't deserve it but... I hope you will. Because I honestly have no idea how to live without you.
bella,You won't be able to get rid of me once Alice changes me.
edward,She won't have to. There are ways to keep the Volturi in the dark.
bella, They'll come after your whole family. You'd risk that just to keep me human?
edward,Just? You really don't understand what you'd be giving up.
bella,"I really do. They look at each other; an impasse.    She decides something, grabs her jeans, pulls them on--"
bella,You're not the only one with a say in it.
bella,You all know what Edward wants. And you know what I want. But I won't force myself on you...
bella,I think the only fair way to handle this is by vote -- EDWARD You can't be serious --
bella," This is my meeting, Edward."
bella,"However this turns out, I'm not letting the Volturi hurt you. I'll go back to Italy alone --"
emmett,The hell you will.   I'm not missing another fight.
bella,"That's not up for a vote, Emmett.    I don't want you involved."
esme,"We've always been involved, honey, and we're not going to stop --"
bella,"No, please -- I want you to seriously think about this. If I join you, you'll be stuck with me for a long time - forever. It's a huge decision. And I want - I need your honesty here."
bella,Then let's take a vote... Alice?
alice,"Like you're not already my sister.     Of course, yes!"
jasper,I vote yes. It'll be a relief not to want to kill you.
bella,"Um.   Thanks? Okay, Rosalie? Rosalie, torn, looks at Edward who's stony toward her."
rosalie,"Edward, I'm sorry for what I did. I really am. And I know you're not ready to forgive me...  So... no."
emmett,I vote hell yeah. We can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way.
esme,I already think of you as part of the family. Yes.
bella,"Thank you, Esme. Carlisle moves, not to Bella, but to --"
carlisle,Edward --
edward,"You can't go along with this, Carlisle, you know what it means."
carlisle,"You've chosen not to live without her, which leaves me no choice. I won't lose my son.  But Alice has never turned anyone. It'd be safer if I did it --"
bella,Thank you.    Thank you all. EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - SAME
victoria,Where you headed?
driver,Seattle.
victoria, Sounds perfect.
edward,When? BELLA After graduation.
bella,It'll be best for Dad that way. I can pretend to be at college somewhere. Carlisle suggested it. But...  I wish you'd be the one to change me.
edward, Would you be willing to trade for that?
bella, Name it.
edward,Five more years as a human.
bella,The Volturi won't wait that long.
edward,I'll settle for three.
bella, I won't risk it. It'll have to be Carlisle.
edward,Why are you so willing to give up your soul?
bella,Because I don't believe you've lost yours. And I want to share mine with you forever.
edward,He wants to talk to me.
bella,"Well, he can talk to me first."
jacob,You're still alive.
edward,He thinks I'm keeping you away.
jacob, Stay the hell out of my head!
bella,"Dad grounded me, Jake. We're trying to get back before he wakes up."
edward,"Jacob, I know you have something to say to me, but I'd like to say something first. Alright?"
edward, Thank you. For keeping Bella alive when I... didn't.
jacob,"No, you didn't. And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me."
edward,I know. I'm still grateful.  But I'm back now. And I'm not leaving Bella's side till she orders me away.
jacob,We'll see.
edward,"Either way, we'll handle Victoria from here on out."
jacob,She's been laying low. Ever since your freaky sister showed up. Guess she can't stand you Cullens either.
edward,She'll come back.
jacob,"She does, she's ours.   She killed on our turf."
edward,We'll see.
edward, I haven't forgotten.
jacob,Good.
bella,What?   What key point?
jacob,"If any of them bites a human, the truce is over. That's bite, not kill."
bella," But... if I choose it, it's none of your business."
jacob,If you... what!? No.      No way.   I won't let you --
edward,"-- Bella, step back --"
jacob,You're not gonna be one of them.
bella,That's not your call --
jacob, You know what we'll do to you - I won't have a choice -- EDWARD We're done here --
jacob,You don't speak for her!
bella,Stop!
edward, Get out of here. Now!
bella," You do this, you'll be going through me."
bella,"I swear to God, I'm not moving."
bella, Give me a second. Please.
bella,"Read his thoughts.   Is he going to hurt me? Edward does, and finally, reluctantly backs away. But his eyes never leave the wolf's. They glare at one another."
bella,"Jacob, I love you. You're my best friend. But... I can't change how I feel. Please don't make me choose.  Because it'll be him. It's always been him."
bella,But you know how important you are to --
