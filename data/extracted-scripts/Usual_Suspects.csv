keaton,What time is it?
3.," MOVE OUT ACROSS THE DECK. Below is the stream of gasoline still flowing freely.  The sound of the gasoline igniting. The flame runs in front of us towards the barrels, finally leaping up in a circle around the drums, burning the wood of the pallet and licking the spouting stream as it pours from the hole.  MOVE OUT ACROSS THE DOCK, away from the boat.  The pier to which the boat is moored is littered with DEAD BODIES. Twenty or more men have been shot to pieces and lie scattered everywhere in what can only be the aftermath of a fierce fire-fight.  A BARGE COMES INTO VIEW.  On the deck of the barge is a tangle of cables and girders. The mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon beneath its base.  MOVE INTO THE DARKNESS.  Sirens are close now. Almost here. The sound of fire raging out of control.  SIRENS BLARING. TIRES SQUEALING. CAR DOORS OPENING. FEET POUNDING THE PAVEMENT.  MOVE FURTHER, SLOWER, INTO THE DARKNESS  Voices yelling. New light flickering in the surrounding darkness.  SUDDENLY, AN EXPLOSION.  Then silence. TOTAL BLACKNESS.  We hear the voice of ROGER ""VERBAL"" KINT, whom we will soon meet.  VERBAL  New York. - six weeks ago. A truck loaded with stripped gun parts got jacked outside of Queens. The driver didn't see anybody, but somebody fucked up. He heard a voice. Sometimes, that's all you need."

5a.," The man is DEAN KEATON, a well dressed, sturdy looking man in his forties with slightly graying hair. He looks much better than he did in the opening scene. The woman with him is EDIE FINNERAN, age thirty-three, poised and attractive - Easily the calmer of the two.  BLUE 06/01/94"
edie,Let me look at you.
keaton,I'm having a stroke.
edie,You've come far. You're a good man. I love you.
fortier,"Edie, nice to see you."
edie,Sorry we're late.
fortier,"Nonsense. Sit, please."
renault, You must be Mr. Keaton.
edie,I'm sorry. Dean Keaton
renault,Monsieur Renault. A pleasure.

keaton,"Skeptical. RENAULT We find the concept brilliant, but New York is difficult for new restaurants. How can we be certain that our money will be returned in the long run? Keaton looks at Edie and smiles confidently. KEATON It's simple gentlemen, design"
fortier,"This was the part of the proposal that intrigued us, but I'm not sure I follow."
keaton,Let's say for example -
keaton,Dave. I'm in a meeting.
kujan,Time for another one.
keaton,"This is my attorney, Edie Finneran. "
9.,"KEATON  This is Mr. Renault and Mr. Fortier. Everyone, this is David Kujan."
kujan,"Special Agent Kujan. U.S. Customs.  These gentlemen are with the New York police department. You look great, Keaton. Better than I would have thought."
renault,"Is there a problem, Mr. Keaton?"
kujan,The small matter of a stolen truck-load of guns that wound up on a boat to Ireland last night.
fortier,Mr. Keaton?
keaton,"If you will excuse us for a moment, gentlemen."
kujan,We need to ask you some questions downtown. You'll be quite awhile.
renault,We should leave you to discuss whatever this is.
keaton,Please. Sit.
keaton,Enjoy the meal.  I'LL call you.
hockney,"Hand-me-the-keys, you-fucking-cock- sucker."
12., VERBAL  It was bullshit. The whole rap was a setup. Everything is the cops' fault. You don't put guys like that in a room together. Who knows what can happen?  13 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 13  McManus sits in a chair in front of a white wall. He smiles at someone off-screen.  OVERLAPPED:
12a., VERBAL  You want to know what your buddy Fenster told us?  BLUE 06/01/94 
fenster,"Hey, are we talking about the same thing?"
13a., VERBAL  You're a known hijacker. You're sweating like a guilty motherfucker. That's my p.c. Save us the time. Tell us where the truck is.  Fenster knocks on the table.
fenster,HELLO? Can you hear me in the back? P.C.  He looks under his chair.  FENSTER  Where is it? I'm lookin'. It's not happening. What's going on with that? I want  BLUE 06/01/94

hockney,"- my lawyer. I'll have your badge, cocksucker."
hockney,I live in Queens. What the fuck is this? You come into my store and lock me up in front of my customers. What the hell is wrong with this country? Are you guys gonna charge me or what?
hockney,"I'll fuck your father in the shower. Charge me, dick-head."
keaton,with what?
keaton,"Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever think to ask me? I've been"
15.,"KEATON  walking around with the same face, same name - I'm a businessman, fellas."
keaton,Like I said. It was all your mistake. Charge me with it and I'll beat it. Let's get back to the truck.
fenster,"Somebody should do something. What is this shit - getting hauled in every five minutes? Okay, so I did a little time, does that mean I get railed every time a truck finds its way off the planet?"
hockney,These guys got no probable cause.
hockney,You are a criminal.
fenster,Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
keaton,"Then make it. Christ, you're making me tired all over."
keaton,You heard right.
hockney,"The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?"
hockney,"Rumor has it, Keaton's gone straight - cleaning house. I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran."
hockney,She's a heavy-weight criminal lawyer from uptown. Big-time connected. She could erase Dillinger's record if she tried. I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.  Is it true?
17.,"Keaton shoots McManus a fiery glare. FENSTER I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus."
keaton,"Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet ."
keaton, This whole thing was a shakedown.
keaton,How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
fenster,So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
keaton,"It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do."
fenster,I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
hockney,Is it Friday already? SCRIPT DATE 5/25/94
fenster,Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
keaton,I don't want to know.
hockney,"Fuck who did it. What I want to know is, who's the gimp?"
keaton,He's alright.
hockney,"How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?"
keaton,His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
verbal,Roger really. People say I talk too much.
hockney,"Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up."
keaton,We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
verbal,County. I was in for fraud.
keaton,"You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?"
verbal,"I walked. Ninety days, suspended."
hockney,So you did it?
verbal,To your mother's ass.
keaton, Let it go.
keaton,Why don't you just calm down'
hockney,What do you care what he says?
verbal,"I'm interested, sure."
keaton,I'm not kidding. Shut your mouth.
keaton,"No, you're missing the point. Shut up. I don't want to hear anything you have to say. I don't want to know about your ""job"". Just don't let me hear you. I want nothing to do with any of you -  I beg your pardon but all of you can go to hell."

cop,Fifteen so far. We're still pulling some bodies out of the water.
cop,Looking for anyone in particular?
baer,"f don't want any of the bodies taken away until I've had a chance to go over this, understood?"
cop,I have to clear the scene. I've got word direct from the Chief
baer," Yes, the chief. Spooky stuff. Any survivors?"

22.," 20 MT. OCEAN 20  A half mile out from the pier.  The sea is choppy, stirred by the wind. An object floats into view a few feet away, bobbing in the water.  It is A DEAD BODY - a man, face down, wearing a CHECKERED BATHROBE. He drifts quietly toward the open ocean.  21    INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY - LOS ANGELES PRESENT                      2:  Verbal Kint sits in a chair in front of a microphone attached to a tape recorder, his brow beaded with sweat.  On the wall behind him is the seal of the STATE OF CALIFORNIA  He is cleaner, better kept, in a well-cut suit and neatly trimmed hair. He looks older than he did in New York - worn down.  A flurry of voices banter off screen. Verbal's eyes follow the voices back and forth.  VOICE #1  The district attorney's office will comply provided -  VOICE #1 No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.  VOICE #2 May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.  VOICE #1 Immunity.  YELLOW 06/11/94"
22a.," VOICE #2 Counselor, I will prosecute your client.  VOICE #1 Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged ""faceless people in City Hall"" you mention.  VOICE #2 1 One would think the counsel is veiling a threat.  VOICE #1                                     + Counsel isn't veiling anything.  VOICE #2 I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.  VOICE #1 Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.  VOICE #2 You're joking.  VOICE #1 Weapons. Misdemeanor one.  VOICE #2 Counselor, you're insulting me.  VOICE #1 Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?  Voices mumble off screen. Verbal fidgets in his chair.  VOICE #2                                     + Misdemeanor one. Fine. This is ludicrous.  A tiny smile and a genuine look of disbelief flash across Verbal's face.  YELLOW 6/11/94"
kujan,What do you mean I can't see him?
rab in,"The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal."
kujan,Did they charge him with anything?
rab in,Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
kujan,What'the fuck is that?
rabin,"I give the D.A. credit for getting that much to stick. This whole thing has turned political. The Mayor was here - the chief - the Governor called this morning, for Christ's sake. This guy is"

kujan,"If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?"
rabin,And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
kujan,You know damn well what I think.
rabin,"That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know."
kujan,"I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead."
rab zn,He's dead.
kujan,Two hours. Just until he makes bail.
rab in,"They're all dead. No matter how tough you                 r. say this Keaton was, no one on that boat could've made it out alive."

verbal,I don't know about that.
kujan,"I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York."

metzheiser,"Your witness is whacked, Baer."
bodi,He says he'll tell us everything he knows if we protect him.
bodi,No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
metzheiser,I'11 be on my way.

redfoot, The man with the plan.
keaton,We're on vacation.
redfoot,I've got a ton of work and no good people.

redfoot,I'd expect nothing less.
redfoot,Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
keaton,A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
redfoot,"I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved."
keaton,I shivved him.
redfoot,Business or personal?
keaton,A little of both.
redfoot,Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
keaton,"One job, that was the deal."

63.," 56 56   INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT  McManus walks along a line of cars. He comes across a black Mercedes and stops. He looks down at the license plate and walks over to the next car, a green Honda. He pulls a slim- jim out of his jacket and pops the lock an the Honda. He reaches in and opens the hood. He walks around and sticks his head in the engine.  57   INT. VAN                                                             57  Verbal sits behind the wheel. Keaton is beside him. Hockney and Fenster are in the back. They all watch McManus from where they are parked a few dozen yards away.  58   INT. PARKING GARAGE                                                  58 DING-DING The elevator bell sounds at the far end of the garage. The doors open. Two men in ill-fitting suits get out and look around cautiously. The first is TUCCI, a big bellied, white haired menace. The other is HIGHAM, lean and bad skinned. They are bodyguards and give it away by their every careful move.  They turn back to the elevator and motion to someone inside.  Out walks SAUL BERG, a slightly overweight man in his forties with an open collar silk shirt and a thick gold chain on his hairy chest. He carries a LARGE ALUMINUM BRIEFCASE.  He lets his guards do the worrying. He walks straight to his car. Saul passes McManus under the hood of the Honda. He takes out his keys and pushes a button on his key chain. The Mercedes beeps three times and tells Saul his alarm is off.  Tucci keeps an eye on McManus. Higham watches Saul.  McManus pretends to tinker with the car's engine. He has put a pistol just inside the grill and keeps it within reach.  The van on the other side of the garage starts and pulls out of the spot. It cruises over toward the Mercedes.  Tucci sees the van. He and Higham are suddenly busy trying to keep track. They hear laughing behind them and turn around.  YELLOW 06/11/94"
higham,Just get in the car Saul.
hockney,"I get out of the car, and man if the thing wasn't wrecked. And I see this broad in the back seat with nothing on."
fenster,RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
keaton,Give me the case.
pause," The only sound is Saul grappling with Keaton for the gun. His arm is halfway out the window. His elbow rests in the door frame.  Keaton cannot get the gun out of his hand. Finally, he pushes down with all his weight. Saul's elbow breaks backwards on the door frame. He screams in agony. The gun falls from his hand.  BLUE 06/01/94"
hockney,What the hell?
keaton,Move.
keaton,Son of a bitch.
keaton,We did it your way. Now I'11 deal with him.
mcmanus,You gonna kill him?
keaton,I'm going to deal with him.
redfoot,Get a grip. I didn't know.
keaton,You didn't know.
redfoot,The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
keaton,Who is he?
redfoot,Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
keaton,We want to meet him.
redfoot,He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
keaton,Tell him we'll meet.
redfoot,"McManus, you're a real bad-ass, but get off my tip."
kujan,So this lawyer...
verbal,Kobayashi.
kujan,Came from Redfoot.
verbal,Right.
kujan,And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.?
kujan,Jack. What are you doing here?
baer,I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
kujan,Yeah.
baer,You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
70.,BAER  pulled out of a drainpipe in San Pedro yesterday after the shoot-out. He came to                 + this morning and started talking. He was part of a Hungarian mob there to do a deal with a bunch of goats from Argentina. He says it was definitely not a dope deal.
kujan,There was ninety-one million -
baer,"We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it."
kujan,What was the money for?
baer,He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
kujan,I don't get it.
baer,They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
kujan,Who ?
baer,Bear with me here...
63,63 INT. RABIN'S OFFICE - LATER
kujan,Who is Keyser Soze
verbal,Ahhh fuck.
kobayashi,Mr. Keaton?
keaton,What can we do for you?
kobayashi,"My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit."
keaton,Who's your boss?
kobayashi,My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
keaton,Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
kobayashi,I work for Keyser Sate.
keaton,What is this?
verbal,Who's Keyser Soze?
kobayashi,"I am sure you've heard a number of tall tales, myths and legends about Mr. Soze I can assure you gentlemen, most of them are true."
verbal,Who's Keyser Soze?
kobayashi,"Judging by the sudden change in mood, I am sure the rest of your associates can tell you, Mr. Kint. I have come with an offer directly from Mr. Soze. An order actually."
keaton,An order.
kobayashi,"In nineteen-eighty one, Mr. Keaton, you participated in the hijacking of a truck in Buffalo, New York. The cargo was raw steel. Steel that belonged to Mr. Soze and was destined for Pakistan to be used in a Nuclear reactor. A very profitable violation of U.N. Regulations. You had no way of knowing this, because the man shipping the steel was working for Mr. Sate without his knowledge.                               +  Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus hijacked a twin-prop cargo flight earlier this year out of Newark airport. The plane was carrying platinum and gold wiring. Also set for Pakistan."
keaton,You set up the line-up.
kobayashi,"Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point."
keaton,What about Redfoot?
kobayashi,"Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people."
fenster,So why tell us?
kobayashi,"Because you have stolen from Mr. Soze. That you did not know you stole from him is the only reason you are still alive, but he feels you owe him. You will repay your debt."
hockney,Who is this guy? How do we know you work for Soze
kobayashi,"I don't think that is relevant, Mr. Hockney. The five of you are responsible for the murder of Saul Berg and his bodyguards. Mr. Redfoot can attest to your involvement, and we can see to it that he will. He is not of your ""superior"" breed."
mcmanus,This is a load of shit.
kobayashi,"The offer is this, gentlemen. Mr. Soze's primary interest, as I am sure you all know, is narcotics. He's been - competing shall we say, with a group of"
75.,"KOBAYASHI  Argentinians for several years. Competing with Mr. Soze has taken its toll. These Argentinians are negotiating the sale of ninety-one million dollars in cocaine in three days time. Needless to say, this purchase will revitalize the diminishing strength of their organization. Mr. Soze wants you to stop the deal. If you choose, you may wait until the buy. Whatever money changes hands is yours. The transaction will take place on a boat in San Pedro. Mr. Soze wants you to get to the boat and destroy the cocaine on board. Then you are free of your obligation to Mr. Soze."
keaton,Give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now.
kobayashi,A gift from Mr. Soze gentlemen.
keaton,Jesus Christ. Open them.
hockney,They know everything.
fenster,"Everybody I ever worked with, did time with."
hockney,They fucking know everything.
keaton,This is not right.
fenster,I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
fenster,Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
keaton,Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
fenster,I don't know. This is bad.
hockney,It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
fenster,"The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity."
keaton,There' is no Keyser Soze
verbal,Who is Keyser Soze
kujan,"Do you believe in him, Verbal?"
verbal,"Keaton always said: ""I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him."" Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE."
70,70    INT. WORKSHOP
baer,I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser from Justice. He has a file on Sate in D.C. It's been a hobby of his for a few years. A lot of guys equate him to that reporter on the Incredible Hulk.
baer,On the street? A few times. Outside stuff. Somebody was working for a guy who was working for a guy who got money through Keyser Soze. That kind of shit. Could be an old badge. A hex sign to keep people from fucking with you back when a name meant something.
rab in,But you're here.
baer,Shit yeah. I got a guy trying to walk out of the hospital on d fried drumstick to get away from SOZE. I'11 run it up the flagpole.
verbal,"I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal."
kujan,And this is why you never told the D.A.
verbal,"You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?"
kujan,Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
verbal,I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
kujan,If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
verbal,"Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail."
kujan,So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
verbal,"Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.  After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again."
bodi, <<And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.>>
kovash,<<It is longer than that. And not so dark. >>
kovash,<<Don't be stupid.>>
bodi, He says the hair is longer and lighter.

verbal,"That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois."
kujan,This is totally irrelevant.
verbal,"Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything."
kujan,Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
verbal,"The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us."
kujan,"You're stalling, Verbal."
verbal,"Give a guy a break, huh?"
kujan,What happened?
kujan,Then what?
verbal,McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
kujan,What call?
verbal,Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
keaton,"I'm sorry, McManus."
keaton,No time.
keaton,No shovel.
hockney,This is nuts.
hockney,"This is fucking dry sand, man. When he rots, the surfers'll smell him from a hundred yards out."
hockney,"Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him."
keaton,Dig.
verbal,What are we gonna do?
hockney,I can run. I got no problem with that.
keaton,They don't seem to have a problem with it either.
hockney,This ain't my boy we're burying. I don't owe anybody.
hockney,Since when?
hockney,Fuck that.
keaton,"IT'S NOT PAYBACK. I don't answer to you.                   + It's precaution. You want payback? You want to run? I don't care. I'm going to finish this thing. Not for Fenster, not for anybody else, but for me. This Kobayashi cocksucker isn't going to stand over me.  All of you can go to hell."
kujan,And after they killed Fenster nobody would run?
verbal,I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
kujan,Why didn't you say anything?
verbal,"I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't have it. It was too far-fetched for him. Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated. It's always simple. There's"

verbal,I don't
kujan,There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
verbal,But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
kujan,I'm saying Keaton did.
verbal,He wanted me to live.
kujan,"Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'"
verbal,Edie.
kujan,"I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?"
verbal,Because he was my friend.
kujan,"No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton didn't have friends. He saved you because he wanted it that way. It was his will."
verbal,No...
kujan,Keaton was Keyser Soze
verbal,NO.
kujan,The kind of guy who could wrangle the wills of men like Hockney and McManus. The kind of man who could engineer a police line-up from all his years of contacts in N.Y.P.D.
verbal,"NO, NO, NO, NO, NO."
kujan,THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
verbal,Edie...
kujan,He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
verbal,This is all bullshit.
kujan,"He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die."
verbal,I knew him. He would never -
kujan,He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
113.,KUJAN  investigating him for years. He knew we were close. You said it yourself. Where is the political pressure coming from? Why are you being protected? It's Keaton making sure you tell us what you're supposed to. Immunity is your reward.
verbal,BUT WHY ME? WHY NOT HOCKNEY OR FENSTER OR McMANUS? I'm a cripple. I'm stupid. Why me?
kujan,"Because you're a cripple, Verbal. Because you're stupid. Because you were weaker than them. Because you couldn't see far enough into him to know the truth."
verbal, It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
kujan,"Why lie about everything else, then?"
verbal,"You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't"
114.,VERBAL 
kujan,You're not safe on your own.
verbal,You think he's..?
kujan,"Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you."
verbal,I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
kujan,"You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's."
verbal,"I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop."
kujan,"Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there."
verbal,"Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's"
115.,VERBAL  because They'll hear I dropped dime. They'll probably hear it from you.

kujan,No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
