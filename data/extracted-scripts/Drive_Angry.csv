Speaker,Dialogue
fucking driver,Goddamned old man!
fucking passenger,I thought he was dead! She said he was dead!
fucking middle,I don't see him. Just go. I think we lost him.
milton,"The Old Man, shock of white hair, drives the Roadrunner, locks the tires and spins the wheel. The Roadrunner fishtails, slides sideways AT THEM! The truck's gonna ram the driver's side. At least it would"
another angle,"...EXPLODING into the hood of the Chevy! The hood RIPS up, SLAMS the windshield. Truck CAREENS out of control! Milton GUNS the Roadrunner away from truck...but... KRAACK - The Truck nails the Roadrunner's rear quarter panel. Roadrunner and truck go into a spin. A tornado of dust SWIRLS around the two vehicles. The Roadrunner SPLINTERS into a boarded store front! The Truck HITS a ditch and UPENDS. Flips. SLAMS into the dirt on its roof, wheels SPINNING."
another angle,"Smoke HISSES from the totalled Roadrunner. Door creeks open. Milton emerges slow and sure. He crosses toward the Chevy. Fucking Passenger rises from behind the truck and rushes Milton, tire iron held high over his head! Milton spins and KUH-FOOM! --blows Fucking Passenger's hand clean off! Passenger screams as Milton snatches the iron out of the air and --"
another angle,As Fucking Middle drags himself from the passenger side. He got the worst of it. Looks like his face went through the windshield. He looks up -- -- into the barrel of Milton's shotgun. A beat.
fucking middle,I'll never tell you where they've taken her...NEVER.
milton,I know. The EXPLOSION vaporizes what's left of his face.
fucking driver,You...you took my leg you fuck! Milton presses the shotgun barrel into the man's good knee.
fucking driver,Wait. Wait!
milton,Where is she?
fucking driver,"I...I don't... Suddenly Fucking Passenger, flattened by the tire iron, sits up, dazed. Sees Milton. Spots the iron. Goes for it. Milton spins and KAFOOM! Blows Fucking Passenger to hell."
fucking driver,"Stillwater! Stillwater Marsh! I don't know where exactly. They call it Wolf Deer Run, that's all I know. I swear!"
fucking driver,But you're too late. You gotta know that. Next full moon she's dead. Nothing you can do. She's dead and hell will walk the earth--
milton,You tell him I'm coming. You got that? I'm coming to get her back. You tell him. Tell him I'm gonna kill every last one of you fuckers. Milton turns on his heels. Walks into the dust and doesn't look back.
piper,"So I tell him, I says, Frank, that's it. No more free milk. You gonna have to buy the cow you son of a bitch."
normajean,"But you're not fat, Piper"
piper,"Wha? No, NormaJean, buy the cow. Marry me? He's got to marry me. I'm sayin I cut him off."
normajean,You cut him off?
piper,"Not just yes but hell yes! No tits, no ass. And I told him if I see that big ol' dick of his anywhere near my face I'm gonna bite it in half. Normajean giggles with embarrassment."
normajean,You said that? How long's it been? Piper frowns.
piper,"Well, it's only been two days but that's like a decade in horny fucker years."
normajean,So he bought you a diamond?
piper,A diamond? God no. If Frank had money for a diamond I would have jacked his sorry ass ages ago and put this shithole life in the rear view. But he did get down on his knees and ask me to be his bride.
normajean,No way.
piper,Yes way! NormaJean grabs Piper in a great big hug.
normajean,Oh! Piper!
piper,Did...did you just throw scrambled eggs at us?
fat lou,"I don't pay you bitches to stand around. Now get the fuck back to work! Piper snatches one of the plates. She delivers it to a Patron sitting at the bar, then turns toward the newly arrived customers. The American Indian couple scans a menu... ...and Milton  scans her...he quickly looks down at an unfolded map of Colorado as -- NormaJean steps up to Milton."
normajean,"Hello beautiful, coffee?"
milton,"That'd be great. Tell me, Stillwater Marsh around here?"
normajean," Stillwater...doesn't ring a bell. I'll get that coffee. But Milton makes eye contact with Mary, the Indian mother. She quickly looks away. She knows something... Milton opens his mouth to speak as-- --Piper approaches the American Indian couple."
piper,"Hi guys, I'm Piper. Can I bring you something to drink?"
mother mary,We'll take this.
piper,She's a Brickhouse breakfast.
mother mary,And five waters.
piper,Five waters. And what can I get for... Father averts his eyes. He's embarrassed.
mother mary,That's it. Just the pancakes. If that's okay? Piper stares at them as if for the first time. Shit... they're hungry. And broke.
piper,Oh. Of course. Coming right up. Piper shoots Milton a look as she crosses to the kitchen. Milton rises slightly. He's clearly trying to get Mary's attention. She's ignoring him. Piper calls through the window to Fat Lou.
piper,One brickhouse. She turns and stops suddenly. Stares at a pile of muffins kept fresh within a glass cake stand.
another angle,Mary can no longer avoid Milton's stare.
milton,"Stillwater Marsh? You know it? Dale, the father, keeps his back to Milton as he speaks."
dale,No. We don't.
milton,It's important.
mother mary,You're in the wrong state.
dale,Mary!
milton,"And what state Should I be in? Dale turns, glares at Milton."
dale,Nevada. Catch the 50 and cut across. It's a two day drive from here.
milton,And Wolf Deer Run?
dale,Never heard of it. The 7 year old LITTLE GIRL'S eyes brighten.
little girl,"Yes you have daddy. Wolf Deer Run, that's where The Smiling Man takes the wicked children to see the Mother of all things. Mary SHUSHES her Little Girl and pulls her close."
milton,"Mother of all things, that sounds very interesting."
little girl,Oh it is! The Mother of all things bleeds black tears unto those who
mother mary,It's nothing. Just a story parents tell to their children. Like the boogey-man or the tooth-fairy. A plate filled with muffins thumps down before them. Piper leans in with three kiddie cups.
piper,And three milks.
mother mary,But we didn't order--
piper, --On the house. She winks and moves away...eyeing the kitchen window. She doesn't notice...
milton,staring at her again. An impressed smirk on his face. Suddenly NormaJean steps in front of him.
normajean,"So, aren't you gonna ask what time my shift ends? Full moon tonight. I'm always a little randy' during full moon."
milton,Full moon's three days off.
normajean," You sure bout that, sweetie?"
milton,Pretty sure.  Hell of a ride out there. Yours?
normajean,The GTO? I wish.
milton, Hers?
normajean,Sure but if you're lookin' for a ride...
milton,And would you be gentle?
normajean,"Life's too short for that, sweetie."
fat lou,He glares down at her.
piper,"Jesus Lou, back the fuck off."
fat lou,On the house? On the fucking house?
piper,"Oh relax. We gotta toss them muffins out today anyway. She sidesteps him, exits the kitchen."
piper,Get your hand off of me! His fat fingers tighten around her shoulder.
fat lou,"You get over there and you charge them for those muff... Piper strikes. Like a snake. Her hand reaches beneath the fat of his belly and vice grips his balls. Hell, we even hear the CRUNCH. Fat Lou GASPS and doubles over allowing Piper to SLAM her forehead into the bridge of his nose!"
piper,"I told you, you fat fuck son of a bitch, never to touch me again! His nose seeps blood."
fat lou,Let...go...of...my... She SLAPS him across the face with her free hand.
piper,"Shut up. She takes a step backwards, but keeps her hand clamped to his nuts. He has no choice but follow. She pulls him up to the American Indian family."
piper,Tell'em.
fat lou,Wha...what? We see it in her face. She squeezes. Lou's eyes go wide...flutter...he's about to pass out.
piper,Tell them...the muffins...are on the house.
fat lou,"On. The. House. She lets go. Lou drops to his knees, then timbers to the floor as Piper turns to the family. The children are huddled, terrified against their parents."
piper,I'm sorry your kids had to see that. Put some honey butter on those bran muffins and they taste an awful lot better. Piper turns and crosses toward the door. NormaJean is pale as she watches her go. Piper brushes past Milton's booth. His cup is there but Milton is gone.
milton,Car trouble? Piper stares. It's the way he said it. Too knowing. Milton glances at the engine.
milton,"Oh, that's not so bad. I can fix that for you if you like."
piper,I would. Thank you.
milton,If you give me a lift.
piper,I'm only going as far as Blackfoot Falls. The truckstop there.
milton,"And I'd be much obliged. Milton leans in, flicks something then rises and THUMPS the hood shut with a smile."
milton,Shall we?
piper,Get it straight old man. I ain't sleeping with you. Milton chuckles.
milton,"Darlin, my days of bedding a gal ten minutes after I meet her are over."
piper,"Yeah. Well, that's good to hear."
milton,"Preciate the ride, ma'am. Milton crosses toward an old Superman style phone booth."
mona,"Oh Frank, you know how long I've wanted to feel you inside me?"
frank,Faster.
mona,"Oh, you want it faster? Mona thrusts her pelvic the tiniest bit faster. Suddenly Piper's hand clinches a handful of red hair and yanks! Mona SCREAMS in pain, Frank YELPS in fear as Piper drags Mona backwards off the bed."
mona,What's the matter with you?! You psycho bitch from...
piper,Don't. It shuts Mona up. Piper storms back toward the room.
her pov,"Frank hops with one leg in his jeans. He sees her coming. Although he's a big fella, he looks scared. Suddenly Mona steps in front of Piper and SLAPS her across the face!"
mona,"Fuck you, Piper, we're in lo--"
piper,What was that? I didn't catch that last word.
mona,Oh...I...I said...we're in lo--
frank,"Now baby, just hold on."
piper,"I'm warning you, Frank. Don't come near me."
frank,"Look, sooner you accept this is your fault, the better. Piper stops, turns, stares."
frank,"Baby, I can't just turn it off. Now you know that. I gotta have it. At least once a day. It's in the wiring. You did this. You made me cheat on you. You're lucky I'm not more pissed about it. Piper stares for a moment. It's like she's been sucker punched. Then she zips her bag and crosses to the door."
frank,Piper! Now cut it out. Enough with the drama!
asian man,Hey?!
piper,"Pervert. Piper stomps across the lot as Frank exits, calls to her."
frank,"Baby, Please. Now hold on. Can we talk about this? Piper keeps walking. Never looks back."
frank,"Piper, stop this! You got nowhere to go and you know it."
piper,I'll go to San Francisco and stay with my cousin.
frank," Whoa. You ain't taking my car. Piper pulls out the keys, twirls them on her finger."
frank,"I said, you ain't taking my car, bitch. Frank grabs her by the shoulder. Piper spins and --"
piper,"Your car?! Who's been making the payments you out of work, skanky Mona fucking piece of shit?! She drops the gym bag and launches into him. A blur of FISTS and CLAWS. The tears flow. Heartbreak, anger, humiliation. Frank stumble backwards. Tries to block the blows. WHAM!"
frank,Stop...
frank,...hitting me!
frank,"You're insane, you know that? Look what you made me do! She staggers to her feet, sways before him."
frank,"Come on, I'll get you some ice-- She SPITS blood in his face and SWINGS! He blocks the blow and BACKHANDS her with the force of thunder. She spins and SLAMS into the ground. Doubtful she'll get up this time, then --"
quiet laughter,Frank stares as Piper rolls over.
piper,Frank. Sweetie. I'm gonna tell everybody what I caught you doing with my pink dildo. Her laughter becomes a hysterical fit.
frank,"That's it. He drops on top of her, his fingers curl into a fist."
frank,You don't wanna fuck me? Fine. When I'm done nobody's gonna wanna fuck you. Ever.
piper,Go to hell. Frank raises his fist into the air. Then...
another angle,We start close to the ground. Dress shoes. Suit pants.
normajean,Have a seat sweetie. Mary there will be right with you. Indian Mother Mary turns. Piper's replacement. She stops in her tracks. Stares at the Accountant. He winks at her. A shiver runs through Mother Mary. She backs away then rushes from the diner.
normajean,Mary?! Fat Lou leans from the Kitchen window.
fat lou,Where's she going?
accountant,You. Fat fuck. Come here. Lou stares.
fat lou,What did you call me? The Accountant smiles. Fat Lou vanishes from the window then BURSTS from the kitchen.
fat lou,"I said, what did you call--"
accountant,--I called you fat fuck' and we had better leave it at that unless you'd prefer I call you dead fat fuck.'
fat lou,Wha-what?
accountant,"I'm looking for someone. An old man. White hair. Five-eleven. The Accountant smells the air, embraces it."
accountant,He was here earlier. Traveling light. Likely on foot.
fat lou,Who are you?
accountant,I'm the Accountant.
fat lou,That's supposed to mean something to me?
accountant,It will if I add you to the books. And if you don't tell me what I want to know... NormaJean opens her mouth to speak. Shuts it.
accountant,You had something to say?
normajean,He was here. Earlier.
accountant,Yes. We've established that.
normajean,Terrible tipper.
accountant,I'm sure he was. Where did he go? She points.
normajean,That way. West. On foot.
milton,Want me to roll the window up?
piper,You didn't kill him did you?
milton,No but he'll likely piss blood for a day or two.
piper,Thanks for that.
milton,"Hungry? He gestures through the windshield as they pass a Welcome to Utah sign. Beyond, there are lights ahead."
piper,Utah?
milton,You mentioned San Francisco.
piper,Appreciate what you done for me back there but I ain't takin you all the way to--
milton,--My business is in Nevada. Can you get me that far?
piper,What business?
milton,"I'm looking for someone. You hungry or not? Piper considers for a moment, then--"
piper,Yeah. I could eat.
milton,"Name's Milton. You're Piper, right?"
piper,You try to kill me and dump me in the desert I'll cut your nuts off.
milton,Fair enough.
greasy fella,"Greetings folks, welcome to the Bull by the Balls... He stops. Smile fades. Stares at Milton, mouth agape."
milton,Roy.
roy,Milton? Roy doesn't even try to hide his dislike of Milton.
roy,Thought you were dead.
milton,You hoped I was dead. Not the same.
roy,You planning on staying? Milton eyes a door marked Motel Guests.
milton,Got a problem with that?
roy,Your money's good as any Ispect. But be gone by dawn. With Roy turns his back on them and walks away.
piper,What was that all about?
milton,Back in another life I used to drive a truck through these parts.
piper,And you'd spend the night here?
milton,"I'd spend the night here fucking his wife. Suddenly Milton twists around, stares toward the bar."
piper,What's wrong?
milton,"I...nothing I guess. A large breasted waitress, fuckin' hot for a woman in her fifties, approaches with chips and salsa. Eyes Milton."
candy,"Well, hello. I'm Candy. Start you off with some drinks?"
milton,Beer.
piper,Same. Candy plops two pens and index cards on the table.
candy,"And I'll need to see your IDs. Piper pulls her license absently and slides it over, begins filling out the card."
milton,What is this?
piper,Guess it's been awhile since you drove that truck through here.
candy,You want a drink? You gotta be a member. Dry county.
milton,You're kidding.
candy,"Welcome to Utah, Mr..."
milton,Call me Milton.
candy,This license isn't just expired. It's an antique.
milton,"Fine, then bring me a milk. She tosses his card on the table."
candy,"For you, gorgeous, we'll break the rules. Shhhh, don't tell nobody. Milton watches her go. Drinking her up."
piper,You gonna tap that?
milton,Tap what?
piper,"Jeez, Milton, how long's it been? Sounds like you used to stick it in anything with a crack."
milton,Yeah. Well. I've been distracted.
piper,"Suit yourself. But nobody reaches the end and says, Wish I hadn't fucked so much. Milton's gaze returns to Candy. Even a man as driven as he needs a reboot sometimes. Candy catches his look, smiles. Piper slides from the booth."
milton,Where are you...?
piper,"I'm gonna do my nails, take a hot bath and sleep in a warm bed."
milton,What about your beer?
piper,"You drink it. See you at dawn. But she walks right passed the Motel Guests door and approaches the Busboy, who's already eyeing her. As she does, our focus settles on a shadowy area at the back of the bar. JONAH KING steps into the light. Ruggedly good looking. He wears a necklace with something bulky hidden beneath his shirt. There's an old scar under his left eye but a scar on this guy simply adds to his fuckabilty factor. He glances at Milton then --"
jonah king,"It's Roy isn't it? Roy spins from the bar, smiles a friendly smile."
roy,Sure is. Get you a drink friend?
jonah king,Fantastic place you have here. You don't happen to rent it out for parties do you?
roy,We sure do. You planing a party? Again Jonah glances at Milton.
jonah king,"Oh yes. Tonight, in fact."
frank,"I gotta go. Frank clicks his phone shut, jerks the door open to find -- The Accountant smiling at him."
accountant,"There was an old man, yes?"
frank,Wha? The Accountant sniffs the air.
accountant,White hair. Angry with attitude.
frank,Sumbitch kicked me in the face. Who are you?
accountant,I'm the Accountant.
frank,"The wha? I called the cops, not a bean-counter?"
accountant,The old man? Where did he go?
frank,Fuck should I know where he went? I woke up and all three were gone.
accountant,All three?
frank,"The bitch, the old man and my car!"
accountant,What kind of car?
frank,"You know what, fuck you. You ain't no cop. I'm done talking. Frank starts to close the door but the Accountant grabs his wrist, twists him around and shoves him into the room! Frank doesn't stumble forward. He flies. Lifted off the ground his toes drag the floor, Frank SLAMS into the opposite wall and bounces into the dresser."
frank,You son of a -- Frank staggers to his feet. Dazed. Mouth bleeding. He wipes blood onto the back of his hand.
frank,You...you made me bleed. Frank pulls a baseball bat from behind the dresser.
frank,"You leave me no choice but to beat you with this Louisville Slugger. Frank takes a step, swings at the Accountant. The Accountant dodges. Bat SMASHES down on the TV. SPARKS & GLASS fly. The Accountant STOMPS on the bat, SNAPS it in two. SLOMO: The short end rips from Frank's hands, knocks him backwards. The piece spins in the air - for a second, hangs there until... The Accountant snatches it, letting his follow-through gather momentum. Frank can only watch as the Accountant -"
accountant,What kind of car?
frank, I...what?
accountant,Your car. What kind is it? Frank stares down at the bat protruding from his shoulder.
frank,Wha...what did you do? The Accountant reaches out and twists the bat. Frank SCREAMS out in pain.
accountant,Answer the question.
frank,A 67 GTO! Arrgg! The Accountant turns and walks toward the door. Stops to eye a framed photo of Piper and Frank on the dresser.
frank,Hey! Just hold on! The Accountant pivots and flings the barrel of the bat.
frank's pov,"It's coming right at his face. Frank tries to dodge...twists his head...no good. The other end of the broken bat RAMS through his face, PINS his head to the wall. The words Louisville Slugger just visible where Frank's face should be."
accountant,In there. Trooper #1 moves toward the opened door. The Accountant
accountant,I'm looking for someone. Five- eleven. White hair. Driving a 67 GTO. He's traveling with her. He hands Trooper #2 the framed photo.
accountant,"Troopers, this is your lucky day. Trooper #2 is watching the hypnotic glinting coin. ANGLE - High looking down on the trio as the coin spins right in front of us - we glimpse the ancient face in the worn silver - Roman maybe?"
accountant,Here. Look at this. They don't see a coin. But a badge. Letters F.B.I. on it.
accountant,In pursuit of a white haired man. John Milton. He's travelling with the girl in this picture. Trooper #1 fixes his eyes on the photo of Piper & Frank in his partner's hand. Lowers his weapon.
accountant,"--Dead. Yes. I'd say it's unfortunate, but I'd be lying. World won't miss him. Look, troopers. I need your help with my pursuit of this fugitive. If we, we three, can apprehend him...you are ambitious, correct."
accountant,"Wasn't actually a question. I can tell you are. Success will mean promotion. Pay raise. I guarantee it. Now we are going to hunt this Milton, we are going to find the GTO he's driving and when we find him, you will shoot to kill. You understand? Shoot. To. Kill. The Accountant's voice is velvet. Hypnotic. Seductive. Purposeful. Promising glory with a hint of damnation."
accountant,"This man is highly dangerous. He has killed and will kill again. He must be taken down on sight. The time it takes you to follow your protocols is the time it takes him to end your life. The Accountant crosses to the cruiser's back door, the coin disappearing back into his pocket."
accountant,Shall we?
busboy,"Uh, are we gonna do it?"
piper,"Well, I don't know, baby. Depends on how well you do those nails. Now pay attention. You might need to redo that one. He hunches over and gets back to work. As Piper ties her hair up with a pink bandanna. Candy's SEX SCREAMS are starting to annoy the fuck out of her. She twists around with frustration and POUNDS the wall."
piper,Shut the fuck up in there! Milton twist and POUNDS the wall right back.
milton,You shut the fuck up! That's it! Piper swings her legs off of the bed. Busboy wasn't prepared and topples backwards to the floor.
piper," Oh! Sorry, I didn't mean... She stops. Stares. Movement. Someone stepped quickly away from the window."
tv news,"...issued an all points bulletin for Jonah King's immediate detention in connection with the murder of a young married couple in Loveland, Colorado. Their infant girl is believed to have been abducted by this religious sect. A nation-wide Amber Alert is now in full effect. Piper stares at the TV for a moment, then scans the bar. What the fuck? She eyes the EXIT sign where an assortment of athletic equipment hangs from the wall."
through window,Busboy sits on Piper's bed. Still naked. He holds her nail polish to his nose. Sniffs. Jerks his head back.
piper,Imbecile.
a noise,"Piper spins, grips the hockey stick. No one. The cars are empty. The barn looks undistur... A light GLOWS within the barn, bleeding through the wood slats. Then... CRREEEEEEEK...barn door slowly swings open. ...revealing THREE SILHOUETTES backlit by a hanging lamp. One holds a shovel. The other heaves an ax over his shoulder. The third holds a shotgun. The side door on the flamed van slides open. TWO SILHOUETTES step out. Baseball bat and machete."
footsteps,"Piper spins as THREE DARK FIGURES appear around the side of the bar/motel. Sledge hammer, iron pipe, sickle. Surrounded. All seven begin walking toward her. Piper rushes back inside."
piper's pov,LEGS. Three sets. Beat up sneakers. Work boots. Cowboy boots with a duct tape patch. A door opens. Piper sucks in breath. More legs appear.
candy,Close'm'close'm'close'm'close. Suddenly Milton's head jerks toward the door. His hand shoots beneath his pillow as-- The door BURSTS OPEN! MAN WITH AN IRON PIPE held high rushes into the room. Milton comes up with a 357 hand cannon!
milton's pov,"Staring under the bed, Cowboy boots with duct tape patch appears. Chamber opens. Shells drop to dirty carpet. Milton rolls Candy over, still connected. Fumbles in his bag on the floor. COWBOY with SLEDGE HAMMER freezes at the carnage. Can't see Milton. Because he's hidden by the bed."
a noise,Milton rolls Candy beneath him again and raises his head just in time to see--
milton,Thanks. Apparently I shot my wad. Milton stares down into Candy's face. Her whole body QUAKES...CONVULSES. She sucks in breath and opens her eyes.
candy,Jesus Christ. You're the best fuck I've ever had. Piper crosses to the adjoining room.
candy,"Hello? Do you mind?! We're... Candy sits up and suddenly takes in her surroundings. She SCREAMS, wraps herself in a sheet and flees from the room."
piper,"Aw, hell. Milton, in pants, pulls his shirt on, rolls Man with"
milton,I definitely got their attention.
piper,What. The fuck? You know these people? Milton flings his duffle over his shoulder.
milton,Come on. There are probably more.
jonah king,"Shhhh. Don't cry little precious. FF-FFUMP! Two doors shut. Jonah King turns, freezes. Our two State Troopers stand near their parked cruiser, staring from Jonah to the CRYING gym bag. For a cop, this is that one in a life time event. A career maker. News. Media. Leno. Then-- The cruiser's back door opens. The Accountant steps out. He ignores Jonah King and the crying gym bag."
accountant,"Troopers. Remember why we're here. He walks by them towards the front door of the bar. Both Troopers turn and move around the side of building. Jonah King...stares...stunned, he absentmindedly scratches at the old scar on his face then leaps into the Sedan with the gym bag, engine ROARS to life."
piper,"Milton, I'm serious! I want some answers!"
milton,"Yeah, we both want some answers. Milton moves toward the barn as-- The State Troopers walk around the bar. Everyone freezes. The Troopers stare from Piper to Milton, then back to Piper. Recognition."
milton,"Aw fuck. Milton grabs Piper, places himself between she and the Troopers as they go for their guns."
milton,"Come on! Milton pulls the 357 and opens fire! The Troopers, emboldened and fearless, stand their ground and shoot back!"
piper,"No! The Troopers keep FIRING! Piper stares down at Milton's open duffle. There's a gun lying within the spilled clothes. An ancient six shooter. We get just a glimpse, but we can tell this isn't just any old gun. There's detailed inscriptions scrawled into the metal. The steel of it is thick, tarnished and somehow angry. She reaches for it."
milton,"No! Not that one. He shoves the 357 toward her. Piper snatches it without hesitation, rises and --"
piper,What are you doing?!
milton,Have to stop him...
piper,Milton! Those cops weren't trying to arrest us!
milton,No. They weren't. Get in. Milton climbs behind the GTO's wheel.
piper,I'll drive.
milton,You gotta patch me up. I'll drive. Piper fumes but climbs into the passengers seat.
piper,They were trying to kill us!
milton,Yes.
piper,They were trying to kill you.
milton,Yes. Milton floors it! As the GTO fishtails toward the highway--
through windshield,The Accountant steps from the back door of the bar. Hunter and Hunted glare.
milton,Christ. Piper's attention is still on the dead cops.
piper,"Christ is right! They start shooting with no warning?! What are you, a murderer? You escape from prison or something? The GTO tears onto the highway!"
piper,Well?! Which is it?!
milton,"Both. Piper raises the gun, points it at Milton."
piper,"What have you gotten me into? I should...I should...Jesus, I just killed a cop! I'm going to prison. Give me one good reason I shouldn't shoot you in the face."
milton,Because I'm driving.
piper,You know what I mean!
milton,They took my grand-baby. Took my grand-baby and killed my... He breaks off. Looks away.
through windshield,We see the lighted Amber Alert sign come into view and quickly blur passed. Piper stares at Milton.
piper,The little girl on the news? The baby girl they're looking for? Milton nods.
piper,But the news said the baby's parents were... Piper stops. Milton's eyes glisten. He speaks in a whisper.
milton,Sons of bitches killed my daughter. Piper stares. Milton steadies himself.
milton,So Yeah. I busted out. And I'm gonna get my grand-baby back. I'm gonna get her back and I'm gonna kill every last one of the fuckers.
milton,In the back seat. Now.
piper,What? Why?
milton,Now! Piper scrambles into the back seat as Milton watches the cruiser pull up along side him.
milton,Shotgun. It's already loaded. Piper digs the shotgun from the duffle and heaves it into the front seat.
milton,Have the other one ready. Not the
accountant,"It's over, Milton. Stop the car."
milton,I can't do that.
accountant,Really? What makes you think you have a choice?
milton,I got something I gotta do first.
accountant,Then you should have done it a long time ago.
milton,I didn't have to do it a long time ago!
accountant,"Milton, I will kill that nice woman in the backseat to get to you."
milton,I won't let you do that.
accountant,Again. What makes you think you have a choice?
milton,This does. The Accountant's eyes widen.
milton,Piper! Wait! Milton watches the taillights vanish over a distant ridge. He starts the engine...then hesitates...
her pov,We can just make out the flattened Cruiser in the light of the three quarter moon. No fireball. No smoke. No sign of movement. Just flattened metal.
piper,"He's not one of the ones who took your granddaughter, is he?"
milton,Someone else.
piper,"Is there anyone not trying to kill you? Milton stares up the road. Piper considers, then --"
piper,Come on. I'll help you. But we're dealing with that first? She points to his blood soaked shirt.
milton,My daughter got mixed up with the son of a bitch right out of college.
piper,"She knew him? She knew Jonah King, the man they think killed... She stops herself."
milton,She knew him. The world was in a fuckin tailspin and King was preaching quiet revolution.
milton,"It was four months before she realized quiet' meant hiding in the basement, cutting the heads off chickens."
piper,"Jonah King was into voodoo? Milton reloads the 357, slowly, methodically."
milton,"Voodoo, the occult, not much he wasn't into. When she told him she was leaving, he helped her pack. Gassed up her car. Cooked her a hot meal. Then while she slept he broke her leg in three places with a tire iron."
piper,Jesus. She twists her pink bandanna nervously in her hands.
milton,"She learned her lessen. Was a good little follower for eighteen months. That's when they met with some witch doctor bullshit artist in Chinatown. It was Chinese New Year so the place was wall to wall slants. She saw her chance, stabbed Jonah in the face with a souvenir corkscrew and vanished into the crowd."
piper,Milton. Your daughter was in a cult for two years and you didn't know? Why didn't you help her? Milton grabs the ancient six shooter. It's got real weight. His blood-stained fingers run down the scrolled steel. The gun almost seems alive. Pops the chamber.
milton,I didn't find out about any of this until...until I got locked up. Only two bullets left. He SNAPS the gun shut. Shoves it into his duffle.
piper,Not gonna reload?
milton,Only had three bullets to begin...
piper,Milton.
through windshield,Lights ahead. Several. And road flares. There's been an accident. Milton eases the shotgun into his lap.
piper,That's his truck.
milton,Stay put. I won't be long.
milton,"Is that right? In a swift move, Milton RATCHETS a shell into the chamber, drops to one knee, aims into the cab."
milton's pov,"The cab is empty. Somewhere near, we hear a MUFFLED BABY'S CRY."
piper,"Hey! Let me go, fucker! She goes to fight but Man in Leather Jacket approaches her with an axe. Burly Dude is with him."
milton,Don't Piper!  Let her go. She's a pain in the ass you don't want. Milton still hasn't let go of his shotgun.
jonah king,"Milton, isn't it? Why are you here? Why are you making such a fuss?"
milton,"Isn't that obvious, you sick fuck? I'm here for her. Milton gestures toward the baby."
jonah king,What's obvious is that you clearly abandoned your daughter.
milton,"But sacrificing her under the full fuckin moon, that's okay?"
jonah king,"Okay? Milton, your granddaughter is unbelievably blessed. Look around. The world's on fire. Companies own our governments and the people suffer. Daily. And will continue to suffer until change comes. And change will come. Thanks to your granddaughter, Milton. She will open the door to a new world order."
milton,Your BS don't work on me. You killed my daughter but I won't let you kill my grandbaby.
jonah king,Your daughter's death was an accident.
milton,"No shithead, it wasn't. I saw the whole damn thing. I saw who you are when no one's lookin'. And I saw what that night cost ya. Jonah's armor cracks a little as Milton faces the others."
jonah king,"Milton, you're embarrassing your--"
milton, --What was it three or four days before he showed after killin my little girl? You jerkoffs didn't notice he was walking a little stiff? Milton glances at Skanky Gal and Business Woman.
milton,"When's the last time he shared a bed with either of you? Before that night, right?"
milton,"You forced my daughter onto her knees, you sonofabitch. And she made you pay for it. Jonah stares at Milton in shock. How does he know?"
milton,But don't take my word for it. Ask him. Leather Jacket was there. Jonah made him swear not to tell. Jonah lifts a .38 auto from within the baby's blanket and shoots Leather Jacket in the forehead. Piper SCREAMS. The Baby starts CRYING. Jonah shoves the baby into Skanky Gal's arms then swings the gun toward Milton.
jonah king,Put the blonde in the RV. Tattooed Guy shoves Piper toward the RV as Skanky and Business woman climb in with the baby. Jonah aims the gun at Milton's face.
milton,I'm only gonna make this offer once. Give me my granddaughter and I'll let you liv--
piper,No!!! Tattooed Guy shoves Piper into the RV.
business woman,Please. Try something.
jonah king,Let's go.
piper,You killed him! You bastard you --
business woman,"Next time I shoot that mouth right off your face. Jonah gazes out the window as the RV pulls away, Piper's SOBS rising behind him."
jonah's pov,"Milton's body lays there. Unmoving. His one eye staring skyward. Void of life as the RV pulls away, leaving the cluster of cars, the wreck and body of Milton behind."
on gto,AS Milton stumbles to the open passenger door.
another angle,"MAN WITH WIG comes from the back of the Station Wagon with the scoped hunting rifle. Aims. BLAM - His shot rips into the GTO, blows the side mirror off. Milton FIRES back with the shotgun - forcing Man with Wig back behind the wagon."
their pov,"The cratered cruiser lies on its crushed roof, both doors shut. No windows visible. TEEN #1 lights a chillum pipe, inhales. Holds it, passes the pipe, then speaks as only a pothead can."
accountant,"Carpenter and despite what you've heard, prefers short hair. Teen #2 sits up suddenly, coughing."
accountant,"Not even close. I won't see you again until... He tilts his head, as if reading a sign too far away."
accountant,"...until you're seventy-three. He glances at Teen #1, then --"
accountant,"You, I'll see in three months. And with that the Accountant turns and strides away."
his pov,"A rapidly growing black blotch on the road. In seconds that blotch reveals itself as the GTO ripping up the highway, gaining fast. The baby SCREAMS in the background. When Jonah speaks...it is with wonder."
jonah king,Look at this. He's still coming.
tattoo,Who's still coming?
jonah king,The old man. He's alive.
business womam,Stay down! That's impossible!
tattoo,You shot him in the face! He can't--
jonah king,"Don't you see? We stand at the crossroads! Did you think we would just idly change the world? The forces of evil challenge us! This is wonderful! We show ourselves to be worthy. I'm so very proud of each one of you. Tattoo and Business Woman beam. Skanky pulls her tit out, shoves it in the baby's face. The kid goes quiet as -- The back glass SHATTERS. Everyone ducks!"
in rearview,The front end of a fast approaching vehicle!
through windshield,The RV pulls off the road to the left. Milton looks up just as he passes the turn off.
milton,Shit! He SLAMS on his brakes.
piper,Oops.
jonah king,"I am patient and forgiving, but that was wrong of you. He turns to her."
jonah king,I'm going to kill you now. And then I'm going to rape your corpse. So that in the afterlife you might consider your sin this day. Piper CRACKS her knuckles.
piper,Great. Between now and then. I'm'a fuck you up. He takes a step and swings a punch.
milton,"Son of a bitch. Milton snatches the 357, points it out the back glass and opens fire."
through windshield,The RV has pulled ahead and vanishes over a hilltop. Milton FLOORS it!
through windshield,The Lincoln fireball SLAMS into the ground before her! Lady in Leopardskin shields her face as --
piper,Give me the baby and I'll make the pain go away. Suddenly everyone SLAMS into the side of the RV!
through windshield,"Piper swings out, clinging to the door for dear life!"
jonah king,"Goodbye, child."
milton,"Got ya. Piper nods, crawls toward the windshield, Milton tries to pull her in as --"
piper,"Jesus, Milton. How? She pulls him close...looks at the back of his head."
milton,It's still in there. The bullet. I can feel it.
piper,But how...how are you still alive? He stares back toward the RV. Just a dot on the horizon now.
milton,Ain't got time to die.
piper,"I tried, Milton. I tried to get her back."
milton,"I know, baby. I know. Jonah only had about twenty followers. We hurt him good today."
piper,Fuckin devil worshipers freak me out. They mess with powers that should be left alone. Turns my shit white.
milton,Powers. It's all bullshit.
piper,"No, Milton. It's real. Ghosts, UFOs, bigfoot, that's the bullshit. The Devil and demons? Once those doors are opened you're fucked. Milton rolls his one good eye. Piper turns back to the GTO. Smoke hissing from the engine."
piper,What do we do now?
milton,I used to know a guy lived out this way. You got one of them portable phones?
piper,"Portable phones? You mean a cell phone? Yeah, in my bag."
his pov,"He's crawling toward the Station Wagon. Someone...somewhere...is HUMMING Wig turns, squints."
accountant,"Scorcher today, huh? He takes a big long swing from an oversized water bottle."
accountant,Christ on a cracker. My apologies. The Accountant grabs the man by the collar and drags him into the shade of the Station Wagon where he flips him around into a sitting position. Wig's shirt falls open revealing a pentagram tattooed above his left breast.
accountant,What's that supposed to mean?
accountant,Pact huh? That's cute. Funny he's never mentioned you. Wig stares down at his mangled legs. The Accountant notices.
accountant,"Yeah, those are fucked. Here, have some water. Wig takes the offered water as Accountant kneels before him."
accountant,Milton's work I take it?
accountant,I'm the Accountant. I'm curious. And I never get curious. What do you people want with Milton?
accountant,Does it matter? Milton. Why is he important to you?
accountant,Why? Wig stares...searches for an answer. The Accountant snatches a mangled ankle and twists. Wig's body stiffens and he SCREAMS.
accountant,Color me curious. What DID you do and who DID you take?
piper,Lemme know if I hurt you.
milton,"Do what you gotta do. You get used to the pain. Piper pulls a black bandanna from her pack, there are white skulls on it. She folds it, ties it around Milton's head."
piper,There. That's better. When she moves aside we see she's lined up a skull over his missing eye.
on wrecker,As the DRIVER steps out...stands half hidden by the door as
piper,Why does everyone keep saying that?
webster,Because he IS dead. Sure as shit supposed to be anyway. Webster and Milton eye one another for a long beat then --
webster,"I carried your coffin, old man. I was there the day we put your ass in the ground. Piper stares at Milton. Milton stares at Webster."
milton,"Webster, you gonna yank that .44 or just keep stroking it?"
webster,That depends. How's this possible?
milton,You heard about my daughter?
milton,Then you know why I'm back.
piper,Back? Back from where? What. The Fuck. Are you two talking about?!
webster,It true they took the little one? Milton nods.
webster,Put her in neutral. I'll pull the truck around. But Piper can't tear her eyes away from Milton.
rookie,"Sarge! Sarge look at this! Rookie squats to the ground as SARGE, leather skin, approaches, stares, frowns."
sarge,Yeah?
rookie,Cigarette butt.
sarge,I see that.
rookie,Sarge! It's less than twenty feet from the victims!
sarge,And less than three feet from the ash bin. Sarge points to an ash bin filled with sand. Over a hundred cigarette butts salute the sky.
sarge,"Pay attention, Rookie. But Rookie's attention has quickly OCD'd elsewhere."
rookie,Hey!
his pov,"CAP, an American Indian man walks the crime scene. Jeans, cowboy boots, a Dumbledore Dies On Page 596 sweatshirt. His dress may look out of place but his face and attitude are all business."
rookie,You! You can't be here! Rookie rushes forward.
sarge,Rookie!
rookie,"Sarge, this joker can't just stomp around the crime scene. Sarge catches up, nods with respect to Cap."
sarge,Captain. Sorry about that. Cap looks up then stares at Rookie's feet.
cap,One of yours?
sarge,"Yessir, I won't let it happen again."
cap,Get him out of here.
sarge,"Cap, he's green, that's all."
cap,"He's standing on evidence. Rookie leaps back revealing two shell casings. Cap kneels, stares."
uniformed officer,Cap! We got a live one.
cap,You're gonna be okay now. I won't let anything happen to you.
candy,He...he killed them. He killed all of them.
cap,Who did?
candy,"No. You don't understand, we was fuckin'. He killed them while we was fuckin'. That's never happened to me before, has it happened to you? Cap turns to Sarge who is standing near."
cap,Let's get a shrink in here too.
webster,Engine's shot to hell.
piper,"Can you fix it? He leans close, hands caress the engine, searching. Somewhere near a fire CRACKLES. Piper turns."
her pov,"Milton stands just through the barn doors, stokes a fire within a 50 gallon drum. Flames rising."
piper,I don't...how is this possible?
webster,He loved his daughter.
piper,"Lots of daddy's love their daughters, doesn't explain shattering reality."
webster,That one loved his little girl enough to make her hate him.  Like Timmy yellin' at Lassie to go home? Piper looks even more confused.
webster,You never watched...forget it. Milton was a bad husband but he was a good father. Used to say it was the only thing he was ever good at. Then we went and got mixed up with the wrong crowd. Power and money and once you're in there ain't no gettin' out. So to keep her safe he vanished the year before she went off to college.
piper,Obviously you got out. Webster glances at Milton for a moment.
webster,"The bastards we were workin' for, they were gonna kill us when the job was done."
webster,Being a daddy wasn't the only thing Milton was good at. Sumbitch was good at being a friend.
webster,"Cold beer? Milton gazes up at the moon. It isn't full but it's close. The fire CRACKLES, POPS. He stares at it."
milton,"You know the pain and suffering ain't the worse part, right? That's what they tell ya, what they want you to believe. But it's all a big fuckin lie. Nosir, worst part's the goddamn video feed. Webster and Piper exchange a glance."
milton,It ain't about the fire and brimstone. Ain't about your suffering. It's about the suffering of them you love. Cuz you see it. You see it all. In full goddamn detail. And there ain't nothin you can do about it. Milton chunks a 2x4 into the fire. Sparks SWIRL into the air.
milton,Fuckin son-in-law. He looked like one of them tree-huggin piece of shits. Wore sandals. What kind of man wears fuckin sandals?
milton,He loved that daughter of mine. Loved that little baby too. He kept fightin long after he should'a been dead. But some people's better at killin than others. Just how they're wired. Milton's finding it harder to speak.
milton,"Then them sons of bitches turned on my...nosir, physical pain is nothin compared to watching your baby girl...watchin those fuckers...I'm gonna kill'em. I'm gonna kill'em all. And...and then I'll be done. Milton finally goes silent. Piper makes a noise. Involuntary. Tears stream down her cheeks. She's trying not to sob. Webster looks steely. Determined."
webster,"Milton, I can't fix that car. But I can get you were you need to be."
webster,"Milt, if memory serves you were always partial to the Nova, yes?"
jonah king,"Yeah, about that fella who killed all them people at the Bull by the Balls last night. The fella who killed two of your cops. I know where you can find him."
his pov,Piper is curled up beneath a quilt in the front seat.
milton,"What are you doing? Piper pops awake, sits up. Already angry."
piper,Fuck are you doing?! Milton stares.
piper,Think you were gonna sneak off by yourself?! Go it alone?!
milton,"Uh, no. I need your help. If you're still willing. Piper stares for a moment."
piper,Oh. A beat.
piper,Well if I'd known that I would have slept in a bed!
webster,"Mapquest says it's an eight hour drive and we got twelve until midnight so we should be fine. And get this, The Mother of all things? Bleeds black tears unto those who cut her? Take a guess what's really bleeding like a stuck pig from the marsh?"
milton,Black tears of oil?
webster,Damn right.
milton,"Webster, I need you to stay here."
webster,Wha? No. You went alone last time.
milton,I'm not going alone this time. Piper's coming with me.
webster,You take that little girl over me?
milton,"Give me the fuckin shells. And the gun. Milton snatches both and hands them to Piper. He then quickly places an arm around Webster's shoulders and walks him out of earshot. Piper places the gun and shells in the backseat then stares at the two men. They glance back at her several times. Then Webster nods. Milton returns, slides into the passenger seat."
milton,Let's go.
piper,He's not coming?
milton,He's too old. He'll just slow us down. Get himself killed.
piper,That's what you told him?
milton,That's what Timmy told Lassie isn't it?
piper,Who the fuck is this Timmy and Lassie you two keep talking about?!
milton,"This ain't gonna be easy, Piper. I need you. That's no lie. But are you sure about this?"
piper,Just drive the damn car.
piper,I never knew him. Momma said he was a drifter.
milton,I ain't your daddy.
piper,Fuck you if you are. Milton notices something in the rear view.
milton,"Shit. Piper sits up, stares."
piper,What do we do?
milton,Nothing yet. Not until... The lights come on.
piper,Oh shit. They know.
milton,We can't stop. Milton mashes the peddle to the floor.
piper,"Milton, this will never work."
milton,It'll work.
piper,"No. It won't. Nobody gets away anymore. In fifteen minutes there will be choppers, we'll be all over the news... She breaks off. Her mouth drops."
through windshield,"As the NOVA tops a ridge, in the distance we see a police barricade. Several State Trooper Cruisers line the roadway in front of a bridge crossing a dry ravine. Cruisers line the side of the road."
cap,"Just keep driving him to us. We'll do the rest. And make sure you peel off before the fireworks. He lowers the handset, addresses the men."
cap,"Gentlemen, these two killed two of our own. I know you'd like them to pay. Therefore, when I tell you to aim for the tires, what I mean is aim for their heads. Are we clear? The men nod with steely determination."
cap,Very good. Please aim for the tires.
piper,Just don't stop.
milton,Too many of them.
piper,Just keep driving.
milton,I'm...I'm sorry I got you into--
piper,"--They took your granddaughter, Milton, and now these badge-wearing fuckers are trying to stop you. You crawled out of the Goddamn abyss...and a few fat-assed county Mounties are giving you pause? Your grand-baby needs you. Milton nods. Turns back to the road."
piper,You know what happens to her if they stop us.
piper,No. You don't just drive. Drive angry! Drive with the motherfuckin' rage that'll take us through that motherfuckin' roadblock!
sarge,He ain't stopping.
cap,Good. Makes our job easier. Suddenly a noise catches them off guard. They turn behind them. Their eyes widen.
their pov,A Mack Truck RUMBLES over the bridge approaching from behind them. It's pulling 80mph at least.
cap,Well...this is unexpected.
piper,Uh...what is that?
milton,Get down!
through windsheild,There's nowhere to go!
milton,Shotgun! Piper shoves the shotgun in his hand. He quickly shoves it out the window and --
through windshield,We can just make out the Accountant's face. He's smiling.
cap,"Hurry! After them! Those men still near, scramble toward the working vehicles as"
sarge,You want us to shoot out his tires?
on accountant,As he smiles and flips his coin high into the air. The surrounding Troopers stare. The Accountant catches it. Holds it high between thumb and forefinger for all to see.
cap,"No Goddamn way. No ever-loving way in God's good heaven are you a... The Accountant steps down, thrusting his badge' into Cap's face stopping him cold."
accountant,"Need you boys to stand down. Captain, you know what this badge means, right? Not a single gun lowers. All trained at The Accountant. Itching to blow him out of his expensive shoes."
accountant,"Federal Bureau of get the fuck outta my way. You boys have blundered into an on-going Federal case. Now, lower your... He stops, turns...sniffs the air. His focus settles on a YOUNG FACED TROOPER."
accountant,"You. ANGLE - Looking down on The Accountant surrounded by armed angry troopers. He steps from the truck, nudges Cap aside like he wasn't there. Cap can't believe it. Shot continues, moving down, closer and closer until the Accountant is face to face with a Young Faced Trooper. The kid keeps his gun aimed, nervous, excited and confused."
accountant,It seems you're serving two masters. The kid says nothing stares. Every cop's gun is sighted on the Accountant. He doesn't seem to notice.
accountant,Take out your phone and call him. Call Jonah King. Tell him the old man is dead. The kid stares until...
cap,"Go ahead, Trooper. Do as the agent says. Rest of you. Stand down. Now! Guns lower. The kid removes his cell phone and dials."
piper,I don't think...why aren't they following us? Milton slips into his hunting vest. A scowl on his face.
milton,They're likely scared of you.
piper,Now what?
milton,Now we drive.
foom,A BOOT slams into view.
milton,Stay here. Piper nods. Milton moves toward the jagged rocks in the distance but soon we can make out the flicking light of fire ahead as Milton moves toward a cliff's edge.
his pov,Piper sits on the hood of the Nova next to the Accountant.
milton,Get away from her.
accountant,I think not.
milton,"I shoot you with this, you know what it means. No heaven. No hell. You cease to exist."
accountant,"All the more reason to keep Ms. Piper in close proximity. You are old, Milton. You might miss again."
milton,You can't stop me.
accountant,"Stop you? Milton, you wouldn't be here without me, you ungrateful shit. That roadblock back there, that would have stopped you. So I want you to drop that iron God- Killer and say thank you. Milton stares. The Accountant, moves. Quickly. With a crisp flick, suddenly there's a blade at Piper's throat. She GASPS."
accountant,"I said, drop it and thank you. Milton puts up his hand, flings the revolver into the darkness behind him."
milton,Don't hurt her. Th-Thank you.
accountant,"That's better. He lowers the blade, but keeps Piper close."
accountant,"You're not the first to get out and I doubt you'll be the last but I gotta know, HOW did you get out with the God-Killer?"
accountant,You did not.
milton,I'm an old washed up lifer. Never occurred to'em that I was up to no good.
accountant,Wouldn't wanna be you when he finds out.
milton,"What's he gonna do? Not let me back in? Now, I gotta know. Why? Why help me?"
piper,I know why. It's because of those crazy fucks out there isn't it? They figured something out didn't they? Somehow they know how to summon a piece of hell to earth. The Accountant laughs.
accountant,That's cute. You haven't told her?
milton,She don't listen.
accountant,"Young Ms. Piper, let you in on a little secret. The Dark Lord? Satan? Beelzebub? Lucifer? Simply the warden of a very large prison. Quiet man, actually. Thoughtful. Well read. I happen to know the idea of sacrificing children in his honor annoys him greatly."
milton,Then why? Why help me?
accountant,"Simple. Like the warden, we all have jobs to do. Getting you here makes my job easier. You get what you want, I get what I want."
milton,"Then help me, now. There are forty of them down there. You and I could--"
accountant,--No.
accountant,"--No. You want to save her then go do it. If you win, I win. If they take you down, I win. He hugs Piper closer."
accountant,You like butter on your popcorn? It's sure to be a grand show. Piper doesn't know what to say. The Accountant glances back at Milton.
accountant,"You're still here? Milton, the clock is ticking. Midnight approaches."
milton,Then get off my fuckin car.
jonah king,"It's almost time. Skanky Gal nods. But there is hesitation in her eyes. She's grown attached to the baby. Jonah takes the baby, places her on the stone altar."
jonah king,"My brothers and sisters, we have come so far. To this place where the dying earth bleeds its corrupt soul at our feet. From its death, it shall be reborn. As we will be. We who have survived the slings. The arrows. The revulsion of those too weak to believe. We have been cast out. And hunted. But no more. Followers gather, move in unison, dance, writhe, fuck. Tattoo approaches with an old rusty knife. It was probably elegant once. Now it is worthless. He hands it to Jonah. The Followers GASP in holy awe."
jonah king," With this sacrifice, no more will we be shunned. They say the meek will inherit. They LIE. We are not meek. We are chosen. The hounds of perdition will howl at our command. For now we... A HOWLING noise. No. An engine. Distant but thunderous. Heads turn. The sound echoes throughout the ravine then --"
jonah king,"Kill him! KILL HIM! Followers produce an assortment of firepower and RIDDLE the Nova with lead! Milton sights Jonah, ready to blow him to fuck, catches the reverend while he cocks the pump. JONAH can see Milton's got him. MILTON grits and pulls the 357's trigger: Click. Click."
accountant,You want to help him.
piper,Yes.
accountant,"He chose you, you know that. Fast car, spunky attitude. He put your life at risk and you still want to help him?"
piper,Yes.
accountant,Then go. She rushes toward a goat path leading down to the valley below. Suddenly something catches her eye.
accountant,Hold on tight. It has quite a kick.
piper,"If I kill you, you can't take him."
accountant,"Someone else will come...someone else always comes. Piper considers, the SOUNDS of battle rising from below."
accountant,"Piper, he didn't steal that gun to kill me. He stole it to slow me down. He's getting what he wanted. Now, go to him. Before it's too late. Piper turns and scrambles down the goat path."
jonah king,Kill him! Jonah and his men open FIRE!
their pov,Soon they'll have a direct shot right into the Nova's open driver's side door.
jonah king,"Well...this has all gone to shit. He steadies himself, grips the shotgun and shoves it into the Nova's open driver's side door."
his pov,Empty. The passenger door is open. Milton is gone. Jonah spins in all directions. Expecting a trick. But nothing. He rushes around the Nova to find... Milton crawling. Bleeding.
milton's pov,Skanky Gal cowers twenty yards away beneath an oil derrick. The baby wrapped in pink blankets in her arms. Jonah walks up oozing arrogance. He knows he's won. He places the barrel of the shotgun to Milton's chin.
jonah king,You lose.
jonah king,I said get over here! I want him to watch me kill the kid! Skanky doesn't move.
another angle,Piper SUCKS in air. Sits up. Fire lighting her face.
piper,"Milton?! He lies on his back several yards away. Piper rushes up, falls beside him. He's alive, mouth filled with blood. She takes his hand."
another angle,Skanky Gal looks up to find... ...the Accountant standing over her. He holds out his arms.
accountant,"I'm curious. Would you have let him do it? She opens her mouth to speak, says nothing..."
accountant,That's what I thought. He turns and walks away from her.
accountant,See you. Soon. Skanky bolts. Races off into the darkness.
piper,Milton...no... Milton struggles. His head lolls back and forth. Eyes flick around. Searching.
milton,Where...where is she?
accountant,She's here. The Accountant hands the baby to Milton. Milton stares at the tiny face. The big bright eyes. Innocent. Beautiful in every miraculous way. He places her in Piper's arms.
milton,Keep her safe.
piper,I will. Anyone tries to hurt her and I'll kill'em.
milton,I know. That's why I chose you.
their pov,WEBSTER climbs from the 69 Camaro.
milton,Webster will look after you both. As long as he can. And he'll keep trying long after he can't.
piper,Milton. This can't...you can't just give up. There's gotta be something we can do to...
milton,"Beat the devil? Nah. Never gonna happen. I'm askin more than I have a right to. I know it. But love her for me, Piper. Love her and make her yours. I don't have any right to ask for your promise..."
milton,"Thank you. And like that. The life fades from his eyes. Piper holds the baby close, SOBS. She looks up at the Accountant. But he is gone."
milton,How was that?
accountant,"I've seen better. Guess she doesn't know you can beat him, slow him, shoot him, even stop him..."
milton,...But you can't kill a dead man. Milton sits up slowly. Bones CREAK. He holds his hand out. The Accountant takes it. Pulls him to his feet. They turn and walk toward the rising sun. They walk until they are just silhouettes against a bright yellow glow...then... ...they fade into the shimmering heat... ...and they are gone.
