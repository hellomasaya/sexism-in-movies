Speaker,Dialogue
chris,There's no bad crowds dude. Only bad comedians.
kumail,You complain about the crowd like all the time.
chris,"Yeah, but that's when they're really bad."
kumail,"So like ninety percent of the time, they're really bad? 2"
chris,"Will you just watch and give me notes tonight? If we both give each other notes, I think it would be helpful."
kumail,"Your notes are just to add more ""fucks"" into the bit."
chris,Fuck's a funny word. Soft on the top and it's hard on the end.
mary,That was truly horrible.
kumail,"Hey, that was great."
mary,"No, he didn't even crack a smile. I thought I was gonna puke."
chris,Who?
mary,Bob Dalavan.
chris,Who's Bob Dalaban?
cj,"Bob Dalavan - works for the Montreal Comedy Festival, you fuckin' doof. Don't you want to get noticed? Move to LA? Hang out with Elijah Wood and shit."
dodd,No one's on stage?
mary,No!
kumail,He might have been doing cocaine. 3
cj,Was he doing cocaine recreationally?
mary,A true cokehead.
chris,Confidence. Poise. Smile.
kumail,He's like if a serial killer fucked an inspirational speaker.
cj,He's like Daniel Day Lewis except he sucks.
chris,Just bought a laser printer. Printed out like six lasers so far.
kumail,Hey Dodd. Dalavan's in the crowd tonight. Could I do ten?
dodd,"No. Five minutes. You put out chairs, you get five minutes. You know the deal."
kumail,C'mon man. I'll double it up next time. 4
dodd,No.
kumail,What are you gonna do in there?
dodd,I'm making up next week's schedule.
kumail,Okay. Cool.
cj,"I was in bed with my girlfriend and I was trying to mansplain to her that, you know, we are on one little rock orbiting a star in a galaxy of a billion stars in a universe full of a billion galaxies, so I forgot your birthday. Who gives a shit? You are cosmically over reacting to this. Honestly you are being super selfish. You're right, but you're selfish."
kumail,"Hey! Have you guys heard of this new drug cocktail called cheese? I saw these news reports so I looked up what cheese is and cheese is a mixture. Cheese is Tylenol PM and heroin. So really, it's heroin. Heroin's doing the heavy lifting. Just do the heroin, it's very powerful. You already have heroin."
chris,He just gave you Montreal? Like you don't have to showcase or audition or anything?
cj,"It was too easy. Like I wanted to struggle. I wanted a story to be able to tell on talk shows and instead, like, you guys don't know how hard it is not to struggle. It's a struggle succeeding effortlessly."
mary,Did he say anything about me?
cj,Sure.
chris,What about me?
cj,"Both of you. He said, those guys performed..."
mary,"I truly hate you, actually."
chris,We all hate you.
kumail,Hi. 6
emily,Hi.
kumail,"Um, my name is Kumail."
emily,Yeah. We know.
jessie,We saw you perform.
kumail,"Yeah. Now that the niceties are out of the way, I have to tell you that when you yelled at me, it threw me off. You really shouldn't heckle comedians. It's so rude."
emily,I didn't heckle you. I just woo-hooed you. It was supportive.
kumail,"Okay, that's a common misconception. Yelling anything at a comedian is considered heckling. Heckling doesn't have to be negative."
emily,"So if I yelled out ""You're amazing in bed,"" that would be a heckle?"
kumail,Yeah. It'd be an accurate heckle.
jessie,Wow. Goodbye!
emily,Don't go! You scared my friend off now.
kumail,What's your name?
emily,Emily.
kumail,"I want to show you something, Emily. This is your name in Urdu."
emily,Whoa. Does this move work?
kumail,I've had some minor success with it.
emily,Bullshit.
kumail,So you came to a comedy show with your friends?
emily,"Yeah, we're all grad students at U of C."
kumail,What are you studying at grad school?
emily,I study psychology. I'm going to be a therapist.
kumail,"Oh so you're gonna sit on a couch and ask people, ""how did that make you feel?"""
emily,Eventually. Right now I'm doing field work with a group of guys convicted of domestic violence.
kumail,Jesus.
emily,Cheers to that. 8
kumail,"Oh wow. No, don't cheers to that. To you becoming a therapist."
emily,Great. To me getting my masters. We'll start there and then we'll go to the rest of it.
kumail,So my roommate Chris is probably on the couch. He's going to try and start a conversation. So no matter what- do not engage. Okay? Let's go.
chris,Hi!
kumail,Do you want to watch a movie?
emily,"Sure. Should I just, put my stuff down? Or..."
kumail,"Yeah, I would say it's safe. You know what, go for that area. I cleaned that earlier this year."
emily,Should I take my shoes off or is this a shoes on bed?
kumail,"No, it's a shoes off bed. I have strict rules."
emily,Oh wow. That's totally an inflated mattress.
kumail,Yeah. Did you think it would be a flat inflatable mattress?
emily,I did think it might be an actual mattress.
kumail,Well air mattresses are actual mattresses. You're being bigoted towards air based comfort items.
emily,"Sure, I haven't ever seen that movie."
kumail,"Okay, so basically the dead start rising. And the good guys, um..."
chris,Text Lauren. You up girl?
siri,What do you want to say to Warren? 10
chris,"Ah, no. Fuck."
siri,What do you want to say to-
chris,You up? Period. Send.
siri,That may be beyond my abilities at the moment.
chris,Fuck.
emily,What are these scars?
kumail,"Oh, they're a smallpox vaccination."
emily,I thought only old people had those.
kumail,Well I'm from Pakistan. We're still fighting some battles you guys have already won.
emily,"What were you like in high school? Were you like, super funny? Were you really smart?"
kumail,I was very shy. They called me chashmullee.
emily,What is that?
kumail,"It roughly translates to ""dweeb."" I'll show you a picture. 11"
emily,Of you in high school? Oh my god!
kumail,Boom.
emily,No.
kumail,And I'm thinking I'm killing it right now.
emily,What inspired this hair cut?
kumail,Hugh Grant.
emily,Oh no. And you're so serious.
kumail,"I read in an interview with Hugh Grant, he said he doesn't smile because it makes his face look fat. So I didn't smile in pictures for many years. What were you like in high school? Were you voted... Most Sexy?"
emily,"No. I was voted ""Most Noticeable."""
kumail,That's good.
emily,"No. It's really not good. I had acne, and I was a Goth and I had this terrible perm. The kids called me Beetlejuice. I don't know why. Actually I do know why, it's because they thought I looked like Beetlejuice. I think I'm done with this subject. In fact, I think I'm gonna go home."
kumail,Wait we haven't even had sex again yet. 12
emily,No. No. I'm really not that kind of girl. I only have sex once on a first date. Plus a hand job.
kumail,Well I haven't had that yet!
emily,You don't get that because you made fun of me.
kumail,What is happening right now? What are you doing?
emily,I'm changing under this blanket.
kumail,"I've seen everything. Do you remember, we were just having sex?"
emily,"Yeah, but you were in the throes of passion then. Listen, I had a really nice time. Thank you very much. I'm just gonna call an Uber and go home."
kumail,Your driver will be ready as soon as he puts on his pants.
emily,Were you available for rides while we were fucking?
kumail,"Yeah, but I only looked a couple of times."
kumail,So. Maybe I'll run into you at the club sometime and we can grab a drink?
emily,I'm not really - I know this sounds like a line - but I'm not really dating right now. I have a lot of school and work and just a lot on my plate.
kumail,"That's perfect because I'm not really dating right now either. I actually have a pretty strict two-day rule where I can't see someone more than two days in a row. So since we hung out for two days, if I were to see you again, which I won't because you're not dating, I'm not dating, I wouldn't be able to see you until Monday."
emily,"We haven't hung out for two days. We've hung out for about five hours. Just to like, be totally clear."
kumail,"Yesterday and today. Cause it's after midnight, today is actually tomorrow. Earlier tonight was yesterday. So two days."
emily,"You see, I don't date time nerds, so that really takes you off the table."
kumail,"That works out, because I am a hard core time nerd."
emily,"Yeah, I can tell."
kumail,"I'm like, very strict about AM/PM stuff."
emily,"So wait, just to establish, what did we just decide?"
kumail,We decided we aren't ever going to see each other again. 14
emily,Great. I'm glad we're on the same page.
kumail,I don't want to touch your jeans.
azmat,They're like sweatpants. You should be stylish like your father. It's not very difficult. Just observe me.
naveed,Get some Daddy Style.
sharmeen,"Kumi, why don't you grow a beard? Not like Naveed's, just a small one."
azmat,"Maybe like mine, small and stylish."
sharmeen,"Kumi, I've been thinking, you know, why you don't enroll for LSAT now?"
kumail,"Yeah sorry, Ma. I haven't done it yet. I like that you bring it up as though you've never brought it up before."
naveed,How's the stand-up coming Bhai?
kumail,It's going fine.
sharmeen,Since when are you someone to stand-up? You know who I think should stand up is Malala. She has something to say. 15
naveed,Ma-la-la.
kumail,"She does open mics and she crushes. Lot of ethnic material, which I think is a crutch, and that one story gets a lot of play, but -"
fatima,You should be on that show Saturday Night Live!
naveed,SNL!
kumail,"That's a great idea. I should e-mail them, I don't know why I hadn't thought of that."
azmat,"You know, I hacked into your Cousin Rehan's Facebook account-"
kumail,You hacked into it?
azmat,"Yeah, they were not accepting my friend request so I had to hack into it and I discovered he and that white woman he is living with are having a baby -"
kumail,They're married.
azmat,"Yeah, whatever. And then I hacked into Tumblr and I discovered that they named him Dav. Can you imagine?"
kumail,Dave. It's probably Dave.
all,"Ah, Dave. Yes, Dave."
sharmeen,"Very, very, very sad. No one is going to visit that baby. That baby, mark my words, will grow up without a family. 16"
fatima,It's like he's dead. Or worse.
sharmeen,"It's very sad. Kumi, go pray now so we can eat ice cream. Go! The ja-namaz is downstairs."
naveed,Hurry up yaar. Ice cream.
azmat,My mother used to make best kulfi. Your grandmother.
kumail,I think ice cream is better than kulfi.
azmat,"No, no-"
sharmeen,Oh. I wonder who that could be?
kumail,"I'm guessing it's a young, single Pakistani woman who just happened to be driving by our house, which is in a cul- de-sac and I'm also guessing that the phrase ""dropped in"" will be said in the next ten seconds."
sharmeen,Everyone. This is Zubeida. She just dropped in.
zubeida,Salaam.
all,Wa alaikum salaam.
sharmeen,"Please, sit."
zubeida,"Here, Kumail. For your files. Your X- Files. Because that's your favorite show, huh?"
kumail,Thank you so much.
zubeida,The truth is out there!
kumail,It's from the show. Thank you.
sharmeen,I hope you come back.
kumail,"Okay, Ma, yeah. I just wish you were better at it, you know?  18"
sharmeen,Ha. Ha. Ha.
kumail,"You brought your A-game with Naveed, but then with me, you're kind of just phoning it in a little bit."
sharmen,"Again with the comedy, the comedy. All the time with the comedy. Be serious!"
kumail,I am serious! That's why I want to help you get better!
emily,"So, are you ever going to let me sit in the front seat?"
kumail,"No, I'm a professional. And you're paying for this ride."
emily,I don't want to pay for this ride! It's surging right now.
kumail,"Yeah, sorry. You shouldn't have typed in the number."
kumail,"Okay. The year is 1969. MGM has had a string of failures. So, it turns to its most bankable star, Vincent Price."
emily,"Is this your compatibility test? Like, the way people are with Vonnegut or The Big Lebowski?"
kumail,No! Just watch the movie. And take it seriously.
emily,I'm going to love it. I love it when men test me on my taste.
kumail,"I just want to share this movie with you, so I don't know why you're reading into-"
emily,How many women have you shown this movie to?
kumail,Zero.
emily,"How many women have you shown a B Horror movie to on like, a third date."
kumail,This is not a B horror movie.
emily,"I'm ready, I'm ready!"
kumail,"Ok, I'll hit play."
emily,I'm watching!
kumail,Shhhhhh! Watch this part.
emily,Stop watching me!
kumail,No! Are you tired? We can watch it later.
emily,"I just have that weird yawning thing that happens, when you're watching a really boring film."
kumail,It's not boring! Wait for it to kick in. The plot kicks in really soon.
emily,"That was fun. Thanks for the ride home, but we gotta stop doing this."
kumail,Yeah.
emily,"I know I've said that before, but I really do mean it. I can't be doing this right now."
kumail,I know. Totally. One hundred percent. I agree with you.
emily,So don't call me again.
kumail,I won't. I promise. 21
emily,Good luck on all your future endeavors.
kumail,"Oh yeah, thank you. Hey, can we have an awkward hug before we part forever?"
emily,Ok.
kumail,Ok.
emily,Goodbye.
kumail,Goodbye.
emily,You just promised never to call me again.
kumail,It's really cold out here. It's so cold.
emily,You make a pretty good point.
kumail,It is warmer in here.
emily,"You know, it's really nice upstairs."
kumail,Is it? 22
cj,"Emily, has Kumail told you that in addition to being an Uber driver he also has a one-man show?"
emily,"No, he did not tell me that.   Do you really?"
kumail,It's really nothing. It's just something I'm fiddling around with. 23
emily,How is a one man show different from stand-up?
kumail,It's really not.
mary,There's lots of wigs and costume changes.
cj,There's a lot of acting in it.
mary,"And then like at the end of it, you've got this very awkward conversation where you go, ""I really liked it."""
kumail,But I thought you really liked it!
mary,I really liked it.
emily,I can't wait to see the show.
kumail,You will never see the show...
cj,You have to see the show.
mary,You have to see it.
kumail,It's not ready.
cj,You will love the acting.
kumail,They're fucking with you.   It's not really like that.
emily,Are they fucking with me or you? It seems like they're fucking with you. 24
kumail,I'm twelve years old. This...this is home. Feels like I never left. Do you smell that? That's my mom cooking the Murgh Roghen Joash.
cj, Fuck.
kumail,Do you hear that? That's my father watching cricket on the telly. Do you feel that? That's the weight of Pakistan's history.
jessie, I have to leave as soon as the show's over. I can't stay. 25
kumail,"So if you get a Silly Mid On fielder, you know you're getting a Yorker soon."
audience,Concrete.
cj, Kill me.
kumail,"Eid Mubarak. That's our Christmas. Except instead of the traditional Christmas ham, we serve Mitthai, which my khansama Chris will serve to you right now. Khansama is Urdu for servant."
cj," Hey, you look like a children's toy from Malaysia."
kumail,Now all rise for the Pakistani national anthem.
emily,Hey!
kumail,Hey!    So? What did you think?
emily,"Um, I thought it was great."
kumail,Yeah?
emily,I never knew that Pakistan had the world's largest irrigation system.
kumail,"Yeah. Something like 14 million hectares are being irrigated. As soon as I read that I was like ""oh, that's going in the show."""
cj,"Hey, that was... You were in the zone, man. That was the best one we've seen."
mary,"Yeah, that was so honest and good."
cj,And you know what I realized halfway through? You're from Pakistan! Good to see you Emily!
emily,Bye guys!
cj,Keep up the-
kumail,They seem to like it.
emily,They're so nice. 27
kumail,"So, really what did you think?   You know, it's a work in progress..."
emily,"I really liked it. I learned a lot. About Pakistan, and cricket. All those positions. But I just wish that I learned more about you. Does that make any sense?"
kumail,Yeah.
kumail,Hey.
emily,"Oh, hi!"
kumail,It's 3 AM.
emily,Is that diner around the corner open?
kumail,It's 24 hours. Why?   You want an old lemon meringue pie? 28
emily,"You're so funny! Actually, no, I just...I really need to get a cup of coffee."
kumail,I can make you coffee.
emily,I love diner coffee.     That burnt taste.
kumail,"All right, I'll come with you."
emily,"No, no! Why would you do that?"
kumail,It's a bad neighborhood. I'm not gonna let you go on your own.
emily,"Why cause I'm a woman? Seriously, that's the most misogynist thing I've ever heard."
kumail,Why are you being so weird?
emily,"Fuck you, I'm not being weird."
kumail,You're being so weird.
emily,Fuck you. You're being weird!    You're being so weird!
kumail,How am I weird? I want to sleep while it's sleep time.
emily,This is normal. Girls go to get coffee in the middle of the night. Have you never had a girlfriend before? This is what it's like.
kumail,Are you okay? 29
emily,Everything is not okay. Everything is not okay.
kumail,"You can tell me anything, you know that right? You can tell me anything."
emily,"I have to take a shit, okay? I have to take a huge fucking dookie. I can't take a poo in your bathroom because you don't have any matches and you don't have any air freshener. What kind of person doesn't have any matches or air freshener in the bathroom? The walls are so thin! And Chris is right out there."
kumail,"Okay, I have an idea."
kumail,How are you?
emily,I do not want to talk about it.
naveed,"Watch and learn, Bhai. It's all about shifting weight and torque."
kumail,Oh.
naveed,Mine.
kumail,Come on.
naveed,"Mine, mine."
kumail,These cookies are really good.
naveed,"They're biscuits! Listen to yourself. You hardly sound Pakistani. ""Cookies""? You sound like Julia Louis-Dreyfus. You're such a burger."
kumail,I'm not a burger.
naveed,"Yes, you are. You're a big fat burger."
kumail,I'm not a burger and biscuit is actually a British term. 31
naveed,Well thank you for that information that no one gives a shit about and you should listen to mom and grow a beard.
kumail,"It gets really itchy, I've tried. It's all patchy."
naveed,Try being a man and conditioning like I do.
kumail,"What's the whole thing with Muslims growing beards anyway? It's such an arbitrary thing. Like who decided that? Oh, we have to have beards."
naveed,"Yeah. There are a billion of us and you are the only one with the truth. Is that right? The sun is just shining down on you right now. It's just parting like ""ahh""."
kumail,"You know, I have to tell you something, Bhai."
naveed,Here we go. Yeah?
kumail,I've been dating this girl.
naveed,Acha.
naveed,I thought you were going to say you were involved in a hit and run or you got caught forging some checks. But a WHITE GIRL? Such a cliche.
kumail,It's okay! We hate terrorists! 32
naveed,"Listen. I understand. You're in America. You wanna mow a few lawns and see what it's like. But eventually you have to marry a Pakistani girl. Like I hung out with other girls. But then I married Fatima. We hardly spoke two words to each other the first few months! But now, Kumi, she's like my best friend. You have to break up with her immediately."
kumail,"If I find someone who's as good for me as Fatima is for you, Mom would understand, right? I mean, she wouldn't love me less?"
naveed,"She would definitely love you less. Slowly, you'd sort of -- what's the word when guys stop returning girls' calls?"
kumail,Ghosting?
naveed,Yes.  You have to end it now or Mom will fucking ghost you.
emily,I'm getting a lot of bright fruit. I'd say it's very fruit forward.
kumail,Uh huh. It tastes like grape juice that's gone bad. How do you know so much about wine? 33
emily,"Um, because, I was pretty unhappy in my first marriage and I drank a lot and one way to cover drinking is to know a lot about wine."
kumail,"I'm sorry wait, what did you say?"
emily,That knowing a lot about wine sort of covers for drinking a lot.
kumail,"No, the huge piece of information you're trying to blow right past."
emily,Yeah. I was married.
kumail,You were married?
emily,I was. I was married. Do you want to talk about something else?
kumail,"Yeah, cause I don't really have any questions other than...when did you get married? When did you get divorced? What's his name? How tall is he? Did you love him? I guess I have a couple of questions."
emily,"Uh huh. His name was, is Ryan. We met in college. Everyone I knew was getting married super young, so we did. And one day I was at a restaurant and I saw this couple making out and I thought ""I don't think about my husband like that, but I guess that's okay"" and then another part of my brain was like ""NO IT'S NOT OKAY THIS IS YOUR LIFE"". I feel like this is freaking you out. Does this freak you out?"
kumail,It's not freaking me out.
emily,I don't wanna put pressure on you. And I know it's only been a few months.  34
kumail,This is also the last thing I was expecting and I also feel completely overwhelmed by you.
emily,That's a weird thing to say.
kumail,Why? I just said what you said. Exactly what you said.
emily,"Yeah, but it wasn't weird when I said it.   It's okay."
emily,"So listen, my parents are coming to town this weekend. Maybe you wanna come for lunch?"
kumail,"Oh, we can't because of the two-day rule, right? You'll come to Mary's party Friday night and then you'll probably spend the night. So I won't be able to see you until Monday, so..."
emily,"Okay. Well, I would love to meet your parents. They live in the city, right?"
kumail,"Well, they live in the suburbs. You know, I don't really see them very much. 35"
emily,Have they asked about me? What do they think? Do they want to meet me? My parents want to meet you.
kumail,"Of course, of course. They're dying to meet you."
emily,Ow... oh my god..
kumail,Are you okay? What happened?
emily,Totally fine.
kumail,Do you need assistance?
emily,I think I just tweaked my ankle. I took this stupid hip hop dance class last weekend.
kumail,You should get it looked at. Do you want ice?
emily,"Look, I'm walking on it. I'm totally fine."
kumail,Can I get you a bag of ice? I can carry you? I can carry you the rest of the day?
emily,"Kumail, seriously, stop."
kumail, 36
emily,"Are you like judging Pakistan's Next Top Model or something? Seriously, who are these women?"
kumail,You know how we have arranged marriage in my culture? These are those women.
emily,These are women in Pakistan who want to marry you?
kumail,They're not in Pakistan.
emily,You've met these women?
kumail,Just with my parents. We haven't like -
emily,"You're not serious about this, are you?"
kumail,"It's my mom's thing, I just go along with it."
emily,"So what does your mom think about you and me, then? 37"
kumail,No.
emily,"Fucking five months   of red flags. Oh my god, I'm so stupid.   You ducking my parents. Oh my god,   the two day rule! Seriously, red flag   after red flag. Such a liar!"
kumail,You didn't tell me about your being divorced until recently. You were hiding fucking something too!
emily,My divorce does not mean our future is impossible. It actually means the direct opposite. I'm not hiding anything from you. Okay? I'm an open fucking book. You wanna know what's in my cigar box? Stickers. Stickers and stamps.
kumail,Aren't you a therapist? Aren't you supposed to be good at handling these types of things. 38
emily,Where are my fucking shoes?
kumail,Aren't you supposed to be handling this better than you are right now?
emily,I'm expressing myself!
kumail,"You know what we call ""arranged marriage"" in my culture, Emily? Marriage! Okay? We just call it marriage. There's another type of marriage that's called ""love marriage"" and that's bad. My cousin Rehan married an Irish woman and he was kicked out of the family! And nobody is allowed to talk to him."
emily,Why didn't you tell me any of this?
kumail,Because I didn't think you'd fucking understand and I was fucking right!
emily,You don't think I could fathom your life in any fucking way?
kumail,I'm fighting a fourteen hundred year old culture! You were ugly in high school! There's a big fucking difference!  I'm sorry. I can't lose my family.
emily,Can you imagine a world where we end up together?
kumail,I don't know. 39
emily,I have to go. Don't fucking call me.  Emily leaves.
yazmin,"Multi-grain, pumpernickel, pita bread, hot dog buns, croutons..I can't eat any of it."
sam,"I don't want kids. People say, Sam, you're gonna love it. You're gonna have a kid and he's gonna be your best friend. A best friend that pukes on you and shits everywhere, and is constantly screaming. I already have friends like that. People say, Sam..."
cj,"I know you're bummed. Look, Emily's a good person, I'm not saying she's not. All I'm saying is this is the universe telling you: seize your moment. Be a little selfish and pursue your career. Bob Dalavan's gonna be here on Thursday. If you book the Montreal Comedy Festival, it would change things for you. You don't wanna get stuck in Chicago, right? You don't wanna be like Sam Highsmith. He's been doing the"
sam,"People say, Sam..."
cj,Is that what you want? 40
kumail,It's amazing. It's the same material.
sam,What do people say?
audience,Sam!
sam,People say what?
audience,Sam!
sam,I'm Sam Highsmith. Thank you very much!
kumail,I'm gonna tell him. I'm gonna tell him how I actually feel about it.
sam,Crushing it!
kumail,Love the new stuff!
cj,We're weak.
khadija,I wouldn't really call it an obsession but... I'm pretty good at magic.
sharmeen,Can you make his belly disappear?
azmat,"No, I'm too happy with my belly."
khadija,Does anyone have a dollar?
azmat,I will give you something.
khadija,20? Big spender. Andrew Jackson? Don't you think he'd look cool with sunglasses?
kumail,"Yeah, you can't do it without the magic dust."
khadija,"Yeah, I need it. All right..."
fatima,That is amazing! And he does look better with glasses!
kumail,How did you do that? 42
khadija,"Oh no, a magician never reveals her tricks. Here's your twenty back, Mr. Nanjiani."
azmat,Do you think I could use this twenty dollar bill to buy something?
khadija,"It looks better now, right?"
kumail,"I was watching this monster movie with my friend and he turned to me and was like, ""what would you do in that situation?"" I'm never going to be one of the last guys alive. I'm going to be the first guy to die. I die so the other characters get to find out something weird is going on. I go off alone to find the cat."
kumail,Denise. This is your name in Urdu. 43
denise,"Wow, that is so cool."
bob dalavan,"Kumail? Hey, Bob Dalavan."
kumail,"Yeah, I know you."
bob dalavan,You had some very interesting premises in your set tonight.
kumail,Thanks.
bob dalavan,I just wanted you to know that you made the finals for the Montreal Showcase.
kumail,Oh my god. Thank you.
bob dalavan,"You too, Mary. Congrats."
mary,"Oh, ok!"
bob dalavan,So we'll see you guys up there. We'll be in touch.
chris,What about C-Dog?
bob dalavan,Who's that?
chris,"Um, me. What about me?"
dalavan,"You know, funny stuff, okay?"
denise, Do you wanna go somewhere? 44
kumail,"Yeah, let's go somewhere."
kumail,Hello?
jessie,Kumail. It's Jessie.
kumail,Hey.     Who?
jessie,"Jessie. I'm in school with Emily. Listen, Emily is in the hospital."
kumail,What?
kumail,"Hi. I am looking for Emily Gardner. Um, Emily Gardner? She was checked in..."
kumail,Hey.
emily,What are you doing here?
kumail,Jessie called me and wanted me to make sure you were okay. So how are you doing?
emily,Fine. Totally fine. Never been better. A thousand percent fine. Just like fainted a little at work. I didn't have breakfast this morning.
kumail,Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. You know that.
nurse bette,Ms. Gardner. Your room will be ready soon. Okay?
emily,"Oh, no, actually I'd love to go home and sleep in my own bed."
nurse bette,"Sir, can you step outside a moment, please? If you want to stay you have to go to the security desk to get a pass. 46"
kumail,Where is the security desk?
nurse bette,It's downstairs. Exactly where you walked in. At the security desk.
kumail,The security desk is at the security desk. Got it.
kumail,Can I get you something? Water. Juice. Coffee?
kumail, I'll be right back.
kumail,What? No. I mean she--
kumail,No-- 47
kumail,"What does ""intubate"" mean?"
kumail,Coma.
emily,What's going on?! Where are you taking me?
nurse judy,You should call her family.
kumail,I'm sorry. 48
kumail,"Hey, Mrs. Gardner? This is Kumail, Emily's friend. I'm so sorry to be calling you so late. Emily's fine. Just want to get that taken care of. She's fine. She is at City View Hospital in Chicago in a medically induced coma. But the doctors say that- - Yes I did say coma."
kumail,Hey. I'm Kumail.
beth,We know who you are Kumail.
nurse judy,Mr. and Mrs. Gardner. The doctors would like to see you now.
beth, Be right back.
nurse judy,"Listen, the doctor will be here any minute. She's just running a little late. Don't read anything into this being in the bereavement room. It was the only room we had available."
terry,Okay. Thank you.
beth,"Terry, Terry-- it's driving me insane."
terry,"I know, I know. But it makes me feel better."
beth,"""All the doctors""? How many are there?"
beth,Five? Why so many? Is that normal?
terry," Hold on. Is staphylococcus with an ""f"" or a ""ph""?"
kumail,"That was very reassuring, wasn't it? Apparently, there are good and bad comas. And the kind that they put her in, the medically induced ones, are definitely the good kind of coma.  51"
terry,"Listen, Kumail... We're gonna handle things from here. You've been very helpful. Thank you. For signing the thing-"
kumail,My pleasure
terry,But you can go now.
kumail,Oh... okay... all right. Peace in the Mideast.
chris,What about this? I saw a sniffer dog at the airport get a boner. Does that mean drugs or bombs?
cj,"That's good. What if instead of it being at the airport, you quit comedy and never did comedy ever again?"
chris,Fuck you. It's a good bit.
cj,Just for the sake of the public. So they wouldn't have to look at your face or hear your words.
kumail,"It's okay that I'm not there, right? Like, I don't need to be there, right?"
sam,What happened? 52
chris,"He put his girlfriend in a coma. You know, the way you do."
mary,He signed a paper that allowed doctors to put her--
cj,He suggested it.
kumail,She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be fine. They said she's gonna be fine. Doctors know medical stuff. That's what doctors do. They're good at medical stuff. This is a medically induced coma. This is their specialty.
mary,Maybe.
chris,"It might be a good thing. She might wake up with a new skill. Like my cousin blacked out once and when he came to, he thought he knew a different language."
cj,Did he?
chris,"No, it was just gibberish that he made up. It was brain damage."
sam,I got another Taco Bell one...
beth,Did you forget something?
kumail,Is she up yet? 53
terry,"No, she's not. They won't tell us anything. We've been here all morning."
kumail,"I know you guys said you don't need me to stay, but I think I'm just going to wait anyway."
beth,"You guys broke up. I'm not sure why you're here. You don't have to worry about being committed to anything, Kumail. You didn't want to when she was awake. There's no need to do it when she's unconscious."
kumail,It's more complicated than that--
beth,"Is it? Because I know about the two-day rule, I know about the headshots and the secrets. She tells us everything.  You really don't have to stay Kumail. You have already done a lot."
kumail,I'm just gonna stay for a second. Is this seat- ?
terry,"No reason you should eat there by yourself. Right, hon?"
beth, It's a free country.
kumail,How's your sandwich?
beth,Best fuckin' sandwich I've ever had.
terry,"Mine's good. Tuna's always a gamble. You know, we're not by the water. Well, we are by the water, but it's a lake. There's no tuna in the lake. Whatever. I threw the dice. I got the 7's, I guess. Whatever the good dice number is."
kumail,You've never talked to people about 9/11?
terry,"No, uh, what's your stance?"
kumail,"What's my stance on 9/11? Oh, ummmm... Anti. It was a tragedy.  I mean we lost 19 of our best guys."
beth,Huh? 55
kumail,"That was a joke, obviously. 9/11 was a terrible tragedy, and it's not funny to joke about it.  Beth and Terry are PAGED on the intercom. They quickly gather up their things and get up to leave.  KUMAIL  Hey, can I come?"
beth,Whatever.
beth,Oh. I-
terry,What happened?
beth,Wait a second- Dr. Spellman told us that the antibiotics would work. He didn't say anything at all about surgery. 56
terry,What does that mean? What kind of surgery?
terry, How do you spell that please? Thora- ? What's the last part?
beth,And where is the infection?
beth,What's the risk?
terry,"She left the lights on, eh? 57"
beth,My favorite sweater.
terry,"Oh hey, that's the book I gave her."
beth,"No, I gave her that one. Hey, do you have that little notebook from the doctors?"
terry,"No, this is the book I gave her."
kumail,I'm just gonna clean up Emily's rooms real quick.
beth,I remember. I met her at the falafel place and then we went to that book store that's hardly ever open and I bought it for her.
terry,You're not the only one who gives her things.
beth,What's up with you?
terry,I'm just tired of you thinking that you're the only one who gives her things. I gave her that book.
beth,Look at the inscription.
terry,No. That's stupid.
kumail,Hey.
terry,Sorry... Didn't mean to surprise you. I was just wondering if we wanna do anything. Got any parlor games...
kumail,I don't-what are parlor games?
terry,"Card games, word games. You play any word games?"
kumail,"No, I've never played-"
terry,You ever played You Can't Rhyme It?
kumail,How does that go?
terry,"It's basically where you try to find a word, a real word, that nobody can rhyme."
kumail,"Ok, Stonehenge. 59"
terry,"Yeah, see you would win. That'd be a winner."
kumail,I don't play board games. I play video games.
terry,"That's the thing. Everybody now needs Nintendo, the game thing, electronics, a thousand dollars. When I was a kid, a piece of chalk and a pavement, that's your entertainment. Hopscotch, tic tac toe, throw the chalk at Jimmy. There you go, three games right there."
kumail,Jimmy was a real guy?
terry,"Yeah, well there was no particular Jimmy, whoever got hit with the chalk, he was the Jimmy."
kumail,"Yeah, tonight's no good for me. I'd love to, but I'm actually gigging tonight, which is like an industry word we use for when we do shows."
terry,Really?
kumail,"Yeah, there's a big Montreal Comedy festival audition coming up, and I'm actually headlining tonight. 60"
terry,"Oh. That's cool. I haven't been to comedy show since the 80's - Rita Rudner at Caroline's. Remember that, hon?"
beth,"Christ. Pleural effusion and empyema, --"
terry, Maybe we should go to Kumail's show. What do you think? Wouldn't that be fun?
beth,Oh my god. These pictures are horrible.
terry,"Okay listen, why don't we go to the comedy club with him? It'll take our mind off of things right now."
beth,"I don't want to get my mind off it, Terry. Our daughter's having surgery tomorrow."
terry,Please. I need the distraction.
beth,Well then why don't you go?
terry,"No, I want you to come with me. I don't wanna be alone."
beth,All right. But I'm bringing my iPad.
kumail,Ah it's sold out. I should've said it before you guys had the whole discussion. It sold out super quickly. They were shocked at how quickly it sold out.
terry,"But you can get us in? You're the headliner, right? That's what you said. I mean, if you're the headliner, you can get two more in, right? 61"
kumail,That's a good point.
terry,We'll sit in the back. They got food there?
kumail,They've got waffle fries and um-
terry,The hospital had waffle fries too.
sumera,"I've actually never been to   Pakistan. My parents moved here for grad   school and they just stayed here. I've   never even been to Canada. So uh, when   is Kumail coming?"
sharmeen,"He's coming. Right, Naveed? Traffic?"
naveed,I heard everything's bumper-to-bumper on the Dan Ryan Expressway.
sumera,That's weird because I took the Dan Ryan Expressway here.
chris,What is your dad's sister's favorite kind of music to dance to?
kumail,Emily's parents are here.
mary,Tonight? Why?
chris,Is anybody here from out of town?
terry,Terry.
chris,Terry. And who's this lady next to you? Is it Cloth? A little Terry Cloth?
beth,It's Beth.
chris,"Beth. Pretty close. Terry-Beth, where are you guys from?"
terry,We're from North Carolina.
chris,Ooh North Carolina. The Tar Heel State! Home of Krispy Kreme donuts! And what brings you to Chicago?
beth,Our daughter's in a coma.
chris,Where are you from? 63
sumera,"It's getting late, I should go."
azmat,"No, I think I should call him up, I'll just call him up.  I just faked that call. Did you call him?"
naveed, A hundred times. No response.
sumera,I think I should make something clear.  I can understand what you're saying.
fatima, I thought you said you'd never been to Pakistan.
sumera, I said I'd never been there but we speak it at home.
azmat, For someone who's never been to Pakistan you speak Urdu very well.
sumera, Thanks.
azmat,Do you want to sing?
kumail,I want to name my kid Void so he won't be able to cash any of his paychecks.
heckler,Go back to ISIS!
kumail,Toast is a really strange food.
beth, What did you just say?
heckler,"I said, he should go back to ISIS."
kumail,Toast is the only food that-
beth,Well that's a really confusing position. Do you want ISIS to have more people?
heckler,No I was saying that to him because...
beth,Guess what everybody? We've got an ISIS recruiter here.
kumail,Glad we got to the bottom of that. Toast is like a- 65
beth,What is it about him that made you say that?
kumail,I think we know what the answer is.
heckler,Lady I wasn't talking to you.
beth,What is it about him?
kumail,We don't have to go down this path. We know what's at the end of it.
heckler,Cuz of how he looks.
kumail,There it is.
beth,"That is like saying that all frat boys wearing country club hats and Hawaiian shirts have shriveled up, tiny little dicks!"
kumail,"Actually, Beth, this is a bad way for you to find out, but he's right. I actually am a terrorist. I just do stand-up comedy on the side to keep a low profile."
heckler,Fuck you.
kumail,"First of all, very clever. Did you write that at home? Toast is-"
beth,Fuck you!
heckler,Fuck you.
beth,No fuck you! 66
heckler,"You're a bitch, you know that?"
beth, I'm gonna fucking kill you! What's your fucking phone number?!
terry,I'm sorry everybody. I'm sorry.
beth,I think I'll make tea.  Does Emily have whiskey?
kumail,On top of the fridge.
terry,"So uh, Cubs doing good, huh? 67"
kumail,I don't know anything about baseball.
beth,I am so sorry about that. That was... I just sort of lost control.
terry,I thought it was sexy.
kumail,"Me too. Not like sexy, but like cool sexy. Not like aroused sexy. I'm gonna not say sexy anymore."
beth,"Hey, you guys wanna get something to eat?"
beth,So is it always like that?
kumail,"Oh like tonight? No, usually a different mom comes in to help me. I'm joking. No, it's not always like that. I'd quit if it was."
terry,Here's a joke.
beth,"No, Terry, don't. Terry's about as funny as a fart at a funeral."
terry,"This is funny, this is a funny one. A giraffe walks into a bar and he says to the bartender, ""Highballs on me."" You get it, right?"
kumail,Oh that was the end of the joke?
terry,Yes. 68
kumail,That was the whole joke?
terry,"That's the joke. That's the beauty of it, boom."
kumail,I thought there was more.
terry,"He's a giraffe, he's tall, so it would stand to reason his testicles are high and a highball is a type of drink, and you ruined it by saying I wasn't funny first."
kumail,"No, it's good. I like my jokes thoroughly explained."
terry,You're just busting my high balls.
terry,Complex finish. Flamboyant mouth-feel. Good. How about you?
kumail,"Hmm, fruit-forward."
terry,Good term. Absolutely fruit-forward.
kumail,This one is in the front seat. It's driving the wine car.
terry,Exactly.
beth,I like wine cause of the buzz. 69
terry,She's a bit of a lightweight.
beth,So is Terry! He'll be passed out on the sofa in less than an hour!
terry,Ah that's nonsense. You know that's not true.
beth,"You weren't supposed to be on the show tonight, were you?"
kumail,"Oh? Me on the show tonight? Yeah, yeah I was. I was the headliner."
beth,Well that didn't work.
kumail,"Also, I think I screwed up with your daughter."
beth,"Yeah, you did.  I don't know how people do it when their family's sick. My Uncle Lew, he got cancer, then he had a stroke, then a heart attack, then he had a recurrence of the cancer. But you know what killed him?"
kumail,Cancer? 70
beth,Car accident. We think maybe it was a heart attack while he was driving. And he did still have cancer too. And you know what? He ate sprouts his whole fucking life. Hadn't had a yolk in 30 years. I don't know how I'm going to sleep tonight.
kumail,You wanna stress eat?
beth,Fuck yeah.
kumail,Oh my god.
beth,"Most noticeable. Oh no, hold on, there's more."
kumail,Oh my god.
beth,I laughed so hard when I saw these. She got so mad at me.
kumail,You're gonna wake him up.
beth,Are you kidding me? He can sleep through anything. Hey Terry!
kumail,How did you and Terry meet?
beth,"I was going to East Carolina University and I was waiting tables. We met at this coffee shop, I was waiting on him. I liked his hair. He was a teacher already. Thick New York accent like nobody I'd ever met. Totally wrong for me. So naturally we fell-in-love. My family could not stand him. We're all military people, army pilots. All my brothers played football. Terry couldn't even change a tire. My father got so mad he broke every dinner plate we had. Now back then, you go to the gas station, you fill up your tank, you get a dinner plate. But just one at a time. Cup, saucer. It took us a year of fill-ups to get the whole set back. And Terry just stuck around. Eventually they just all got over it."
kumail,They just got over it. How?
beth,"Lots of fucked up dinners. How'd your parents meet, Kumail?"
kumail,"So we have arranged marriage as you know. A big group got together to see a movie, but really it was just a set up so my mom and dad could meet."
beth,What movie did they see?
kumail,I have no idea. I never asked.
beth,"She's great, you know?"
kumail,I know.
beth,I feel good about this surgery. 72
kumail,Yeah. These doctors know what they're doing.
beth,No they don't. They're just winging it like everybody else.
kumail,Fuck.
emily's voice,Hey it's me. So I tried making some Pakistani food to surprise you. And either I'm a bad cook or all Pakistani food is terrible. I don't know yet. Bye!
emily's voice,"Hey it's me. If you just wanna come over and like kiss me for two seconds, I'd really love that tonight. Ok. Bye!"
terry,Oh boy.
beth,How soon?
beth,So this is good news?
terry,"She's a fighter, right?"
sharmeen,I was so worried. We saw on the news that a train derailed and we thought that you were on the train and you had died.
kumail,"Nobody died on that train, Ma."
sharmeen,But did they look under the train? 74
azmat,"So, where were you last night? What were you doing?"
kumail,Nothing. I wasn't doing anything.
sharmeen,Kumail.
kumail,"Alright, I'll tell you. I was... studying for the LSAT."
sharmeen,Really?
kumail,"Yup. I signed up. And if I pass, I'm gonna go to law school, become a lawyer, and do law."
sharmeen,"Oh, let me see who that could be."
kumail,"Really, Dad? You said that nobody was gonna come. That it was gonna be just us."
naveed,"Hey Kumi, do you know this guy? People say Sam. People say Sam. Do you know him?"
kumail,"Yeah, I know."
fatima,He should be on Saturday Night Live.
naveed,SNL.
sharmeen,Everybody remember Khadija? She just dropped in. She was just in the neighborhood. 75
khadija,"I've just been through so many of these appointments and I never have anything in common with the guys. You know when girls at work complain about dating, I just want to body slam them. They have no idea. I don't know. My mom says I'm becoming the bruised apple at the bottom of the apple bucket."
kumail,"No, no. You're not."
khadija,I am.
kumail,You're not.
khadija,So do you want to hangout sometime? Like without our parents? Have you been to the cat cafe? The cats just come up to you and nestle in your lap and you just pet them.
kumail,I don't think that's a good idea.
khadija,You don't like cats? 76
kumail,I mean I don't think it's a good idea for us to hangout again. It's not you. You're fantastic. I just can't do this arranged marriage thing -- with anybody.
khadija,So why did you meet me?
kumail,It wasn't my idea.
khadija,I'm just really tired. Do you ever want to just be in a relationship so you can finally relax?
kumail,I'm sorry. You deserve better than me.
khadija,People are always telling me what I deserve. It's bullshit. And stop being so sorry about everything. I'm gonna go.
terry,"Wow, they should call this website, ""Everything is Cancer Dot Com"". Everything you put in, it could be cancer. Hiccups could be cancer. Come on. You take the fun out of hiccups now."
beth,Do you know this is the 17th best hospital in Chicago? 77
terry,Really? Out of how many?
beth,"I don't know, but Northwestern's number one."
terry,Well how do they rate it? What's their methodology?
beth,"I don't know, Terry. But 17th is bad."
terry,"It's not great, unless the sample size is, you know, that all depends."
kumail,"Here, look at the comments."
terry,"This is why I don't want to go online cause it's never good. You go online, they hated Forrest Gump. Frickin' best movie ever."
terry,Yeah.
terry,"They couldn't find out what the disease was, or where the virus came from or the bacteria or whatever."
kumail,But they took out the infection so it shouldn't matter?
terry,"I know, that's what I said but her vitals didn't normalize. And now they say that the infection is continuing to spread, it's in her kidneys."
kumail,But the kidneys are so far from the lungs.
terry,"I know, it's an aggressive infection and they said what they gotta do now is figure out what this mystery disease actually is."
beth,I'm calling Northwestern.
terry,"Just hold on, hold on."
beth,Terry! Goddammit!
kumail,I think we should talk about this--
beth,"--You shut up! I'm sick of this shit, Terry. We're getting her out of here!"
terry,They're in the middle of the whole process of elimination.
beth,So you're saying Northwestern can't take that information and continue the search? This place is a shithole.
terry,Will you just stop for a second? They're the doctors. You act like you know what you're talking about. You don't.
beth,I can't find my cellphone. You got a phone?
terry,Don't give her a phone. You don't need a phone. You don't need to call anybody right now.
beth,Well that's very nice. But I don't. Can you unlock that thing?
terry,Oh - you think that you're smarter than me because you say big sentences. Well you're not!
beth,I don't think I'm smarter than you! You just don't think you're as smart as I am! That's not my fault!
terry,Right. It's never your fault. Everything's my fault. 80
beth,Oh there are some things that are definitely just your fault.
terry,"Okay, that's bullshit. You need to stop freaking out and calm down."
beth,And you need to stop being a coward.
terry,"Greatest hits, coming back. You can stop, I'll replay the rest of this from memory."
nurse judy,"Oh, you're giraffe-ing it."
kumail,"It was the biggest thing they had. I don't even know if she likes giraffes. We never talked about giraffes. Hey, do they know what they're doing? Cause they don't tell us anything. Like, Lyme Disease? You know the girl on The Real World had it? Did you guys look for that?"
nurse judy,"Yes, we did. 81"
kumail,Did you know she gets hurt all the time? She messed up her ankle recently - could that be Lupus?
nurse judy,Kumail. We're looking into everything. We're not holding anything back from you. We're still just eliminating possibilities.
kumail,Cause Beth wants to move her to Northwestern.
nurse judy,"Oh no. Emily should not be moved. The hospital will approve it because it'll get the liability off their hands, but we put her in a coma for a reason. To stabilize her. Moving her could be very dangerous. The infection could spread. Trust me she is fighting. And so are we."
kumail,Hey Terry. I was just talking to the nurse - You okay?
terry,"Yeah, of course. Totally fine."
kumail,Do you wanna crash at my place? 82
terry,You got the golf channel?
kumail,No.
terry,"That wasn't funny, right?"
kumail,I thought that was a serious question.
terry,Let's get the fuck out of here.
kumail,So this is the place.
terry,Wow...this place is terrible.
kumail,"Hey I talked to Nurse Judy, and she was saying that moving Emily could be a bad idea."
terry,Really?
kumail,"Yeah, she said it could be dangerous."
terry,"No. Yeah. I hear you. I'd give anything to trade places with Emily. Being a parent, it's a nightmare. Loving somebody this much sucks. 83"
kumail,Yeah.
terry,And I guess you've noticed some tension between Beth and me.
kumail,Not really. That's none of my business.
terry,"Yeah well, it's there. Big time."
kumail,It's getting really late. We should go to sleep.
terry,I cheated on her.
kumail,Fuuuuck.
terry,I did. It was just a one night stand.
kumail,Okay.
terry,We met at some bar in Cincinnati. They have these teacher conferences. Who goes to a math conference to get laid?
kumail,Math teachers?
terry,"Yeah. I think I was depressed, that's what it was."
kumail,Yeah. Let's talk about it tomorrow. Get a full night's sleep. Catch up fresh in the-
terry,"She just smelled so good. It was horrible too. As soon as I was finished. As soon as I'd finished, I was like, what did you fucking do?! What did you just do?!  84"
kumail,Yup.
terry,I told Beth right away. I had to. She was devastated. Now she hates me.
kumail,"She might be mad at you, but she doesn't hate you. You should've heard the way she was talking about you. Hey, can I ask you something? Why did you tell her?"
terry,"Oh, I had to. I'm no good with guilt."
kumail,Do you guys talk about it?
terry,"Not anymore. She said she forgave me, but no. She hasn't. Let me give you some advice Kumail. You're going to know the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with when you cheat on her. When you cheat on her and you just feel like shit."
kumail,"So, to fully know I love someone, I have to cheat on them?"
terry,"Out loud it sounds stupid. Yeah, that's terrible advice."
kumail,I don't really get that either.
terry,I know. I thought I could just start saying something and something smart would come out. 85
kumail,Hey did you see Terry?
chris,"No, I heard him leave this morning. I'm going to Sevies. You want anything?"
kumail,"No, I'm good, thank you."
chris,You don't want a hot dog or nothing?
kumail,Dude it's 8:30 in the morning.
chris,"Okay, no hot dog."
sharmeen,We just spoke to Khadija's parents.
kumail,What are you doing here?
sharmeen,"What is wrong with you, Kumi?"
kumail,Nothing is wrong with me. I'm sorry-
sharmeen,Sorry? That's all you have to say?
kumail,I wasn't that into her. 86
sharmeen,"""Into her""? Do you know how difficult it is to get an appointment with her? She is in very high demand."
kumail,Okay. So?
sharmeen,So?
kumail,Can we please talk about this another time?
sharmeen,"No, no, Kumi. We will talk about this now. We have sacrificed everything for you."
kumail,"I know, okay?"
sharmeen,"We have left our family. We have left our home. I have missed the birth of my sister's daughter. I have not seen my mother for fifteen years. Your father, he had to do his graduate school. Again. He had to give exams. Again."
azmat,I was in my mid 50's. They were in 20s. They used to call me Father Time!
kumail,"I know that. I really appreciate everything you did for me, but can we talk about this another time?"
sharmeen,"Kumi, if you don't want to be a lawyer, fine. If you want to do the stand-up comedy and embarrass us as a family, fine. There is only one thing that we have ever asked from you: that you be a good Muslim and that you marry a Pakistani girl. That is it, one thing!"
kumail,Can I ask you something that has never made sense to me? Why did you bring me here if you wanted me to not have an American life?  87
azmat,Don't you talk to your mother like that!
kumail,You don't care what I think. You just want me to follow the rules. But the rules don't make sense to me. I don't pray. I don't. I haven't prayed in years. I just go down there and I play video games.
azmat,You don't believe in Allah?
kumail,"I don't know what I believe, Dad! I don't know. And I can't marry someone you find for me."
sharmeen,And why not?
kumail,"Because I'm in love with someone. I am. Her name is Emily and she's gonna be a therapist. And right now she's very sick but I couldn't tell you that. It makes me so sad that I couldn't tell you any of that. I really appreciate everything you've done for me. I truly, truly do. And I know Islam has been really good for you, it has made you good people, but I don't know what I believe. I just need to figure it out on my own."
sharmeen,You're not my son.
azmat,"Kumi, you're being selfish. You're not thinking about us. You're not thinking about Khadija. In fact you're not even thinking about that girl that you are in love with. You think American Dream is just about doing whatever you want and not thinking about other people?  88"
chris,"Hey... I never went to the store. I was just listening at the door. My mom kicked me out for dealing weed at sixteen, so I get it man."
kumail,"Hey, so when are we going to talk to Beth about what we talked about?"
terry,We're gonna move her.
kumail,What? What are you talking about? You fucking caved?
terry,I didn't cave. I don't cave.
kumail,"Okay, okay. I know you don't cave. You're great. But we talked about this last night."
terry,I know. We're moving her. She's right.
kumail,"What? No. I told you what the nurse said. Hey Beth, the nurse told me that moving Emily could be a very bad idea."
beth,Well Northwestern told us it could be very good.
kumail,"Well, they don't see her. This nurse sees her and she told me herself. 89"
terry,It's okay. They don't need to see her.
kumail,It's not okay. There. I got it!
terry,That's a map of the garage.
kumail,"Wait, wait! Do you want to be responsible? She could die!"
beth,"Kumail, we're responsible for her no matter what. We're her parents. Now I'm sorry, we're moving her."
stu,Welcome to Quick'n Hot. May I take your order please?
kumail,"Yeah, um can I get a burger with 4 slices of cheese."
stu,Four burgers. Anything else sir?
kumail,No. One burger with four slices of cheese.
stu,I'm sorry. We can't do that.
kumail,Just put 4 slices of cheese on a burger.
stu,We can't do that. There's no button -
kumail,"Who the fuck is this ""we"", man? Who the fuck is this ""we""? It's me and you. We're just people. Fucking listen to me. Fuck this corporate entity. Put four slices of cheese on THE FUCKING BURGER."
stu,We can't do that.
kumail,"What the fuck, you fucking idiot?"
stu,Today's my first day.
kumail,Fuck you!
stu,I'll just ring you up for four burgers.
kumail,I'm sorry. 91
stu, Do you want any fries or drink with that?
kumail,I'll take four fries. I'm sorry.
kumail,Fuck!
chris,"Hey man, Montreal finals. You ready? Oh wait, are you getting all dark and moody before your set? Yeah, punish yourself like a nasty little baby."
kumail,I am not in the mood. Okay Chris?
chris,I'll get you in the mood.
cj,You all right?
kumail,"Why does everybody say the same fucking thing? Yeah, I'm doing great. 92"
cj,"Okay, all right dude. I'm just checking."
dodd,"The fuck've you been, man? You're on next!"
dodd,"This next performer, my man, Mr. Kumail Nanjiani!"
kumail,"Have you guys heard of this new drug cocktail called cheese? Like that's the name of it, it's called cheese. I saw all these news reports, and they were like, there's a new drug, it's called cheese. Everyone's doing it in the Midwest, kids are doing it."
kumail,"I don't know if you can hear me or not, but it would be really good if you pulled through. If you have to go, you can go, but it would be really great if you stayed. And I'm really sorry about what I did -"
emily,Mom. You're getting your tears all over me. When am I gonna be able to feel my face?
terry,"You gave us quite a scare there, Scout."
emily,Scout?
terry,Come on. I call you that all the time.
emily,No. Not since I was a grown up.
terry,I've called you that your whole life!
nurse judy,Sorry hon.
emily,What is that crap?
nurse judy,We have to thicken your liquids for a bit. Your esophagus isn't strong enough to swallow yet.
emily,That shit tastes like semen.
terry,That's nice for a father to hear. 95
emily,"It does! Seriously, Mom. You should try this."
beth,"Oh wait a minute, honey!"
terry,"Oh, come on, come on. They'll charge us forty eight dollars for it, don't worry about it."
emily,Why are you here?
kumail, I haven't heard her voice in a while.
beth,He's been here the whole time.
beth," Honey, we'll be right outside."
kumail,Hey. 96
terry,"Yeah, yeah."
dr cunningham,We gave her anti-inflammatories and she stabilized within hours. She's gonna take time to recover but she'll be fine.
terry,Wow.
emily,What are you doing here?
kumail,"I was visiting someone down the hall and I was like, I'll just pop in and say hi to Emily."
emily,Oh.
kumail,"No, I'm joking, I was here for you."
emily,You're an asshole and I don't like you.
kumail,I'm not an asshole. I'm really not. 97
emily,"No, you're an asshole."
kumail,You have a lot of drugs in you so you're not thinking as clearly.
emily,"Naw dog. I'm not joking. You're not funny to me. You just make me sad. You make me sad inside of my heart, and it makes me sad to look at you. So I think you should probably go. Just go and tell my mom I want her."
kumail,Emily wants to see you.
terry,"Alright, Kumail. Here's the thing. Your living condition is a potential health risk and you're not that funny. But.... you're probably not suited to do anything else either so that's troublesome--"
kumail,You really made it sound like you were going to say something positive there.
terry,"I guess I did, didn't I? You know I know the good stuff. You know how I feel. I gotta get in there. 98"
kumail,So you gonna hang around Chicago for a while?
beth,Yeah. She's got physical therapy.
kumail,Did you ever think you'd be excited to have your daughter go through physical therapy?  It's so strange that we could go through one of the most intense experiences of our lives together and just never see each other again.
beth,Maybe. But I hope not.
mary,Hi little sad man. Mopey boy. We have something to tell you. We are moving to New York. And we want you to come with us. 99
kumail,Are you serious?
cj,You gotta do it. It's going to suck at first but we'll have each other and maybe eventually get paid to write jokes. It's gonna be the best. Come on dude.
mary,You have to come. I know you did not get Montreal and that is only because you did one of the worst sets I've ever seen in my goddamn life.
cj,It was nonsense.
mary,A living disgrace.
cj,"I would call it shit, but I would be worried that I'd be insulting actual shit."
mary,"Yeah, it was so bone-chilling to me, I thought a ghost had passed right through me."
kumail,We don't have to keep going over how bad the set was. I saw their faces and the noises they didn't make.
mary,I felt one of my eggs die.
kumail,Doesn't that happen every month?
mary,"It happens every month, Kumail, but I don't always feel it and go, ohhhhh. And that's what you made me do. I'm packing my things up and I'm moving to New York, and guess what, baby? You're coming with me."
kumail,What about Chris? 100
mary,He will be fine.
cj,"There's not enough room in the car, probably. We leave in a week, all right? And I already called shotgun Chicago to Pittsburgh. Do not fuck this up."
mary,Your destiny awaits!
cj,This will be the biggest move of your life. Other than the one from Pakistan.
terry,"Hey, clink clink! Thank you everybody for coming. I just wanted to say a couple of words here."
emily, Why is Kumail here?
beth,"Cause he was there the whole time. I invited the nurses, I invited him."
terry,"Emily, come on up here. I wanna say something."
kumail,Hey. I like your cane. I've heard pimpin' ain't easy.
emily,Right.
kumail,"Hey, can we talk for a second?"
emily,Sure.
kumail,"So, I've been collecting some things that are important to me and I wanted to show them to you. I call this my bag of devotion."
emily,What did you do? Did you cremate someone? 102
kumail,"These are the ashes of all the Pakistani women - not the women - the pictures of the Pakistani women. I thought this was a good idea, but it feels a little stupid."
emily,"Kumail, I'm really glad that you went through this experience, but you have to understand that all that happened while I was asleep. Like you felt one way a few weeks ago and now you're saying you feel the total opposite way and the only thing that's changed is that I was in a coma. Honestly, I look at all of this, and I just think, I can't do it again. I can't be the reason that you don't have a family. It just feels totally different now. And I can't do that again. Do you understand?"
kumail,Okay.
kumail,"Ma. Dad. Fatima. Bhai. There's no plate. Oh I forgot. I've decided I won't let you kick me out of the family. Since I am a member of the family, it would stand to reason that I would get a vote in whether or not I get kicked out, and that vote would have to be unanimous. Standard parliamentary procedure. So all those in favor of not kicking Kumail out of the family, raise your hand."
naveed,Bullshit.
kumail,"I admit this one is designed to stir up some controversy. ""It's interesting how you can't really kick someone out of your family because they'll always be your family."" I agree with that one. It's a good one. So, I'm gonna leave these here for you."
emily,What is it?
emily,Okay. 105
beth,We gotta go.
emily,Home?
beth,"Yeah, it's time."
emily,I'm not ready.
beth,"Yeah, you know what? You're strong and you are."
kumail,"And we'd go to the mosque and hear graphic details of religious people being killed 1400 years ago. I mean like Tarantino-esque details. And everyone would be crying, like competing to see who could cry the hardest. And I could never cry. And I was like, what is wrong with me? Am I broken?  106"
terry,"You know people talk about New York water but Chicago water is very underrated, I think. It's good."
emily,"Hey guys, I think I might just pop out for a bit."
terry,By yourself?
emily,"Yeah, just hop around the block, maybe get some frozen yogurt."
terry,"Are you okay? Can you do it, can you walk by yourself?"
emily,"Yeah, Dad."
beth,Have fun.
terry,"If you feel a coma coming on, call us."
emily,"Dad, it's too soon. I love you, I'll see you in the morning."
terry,"Love you, bye."
beth,Have fun. 107
emily,I will.
terry,Got your phone?
emily,Yeah.
kumail,"But you liked it, huh?"
naveed,"Yeah. I mean, yeah."
kumail,Hey!
emily,Hi...
kumail,What are you doing here?
emily,I was in the neighborhood and I saw that you were gonna be here so I thought I'd come say hi.
kumail,You look great. How's your blood oxygen level?
emily,"Oh, well within range."
kumail,Nice.
emily,"Hi, I'm Emily."
naveed,I've heard lots about you.
emily,It's so good to finally meet you.  There's actually something I wanted to tell you.
naveed,"Okay, well I'm going to just... goodbye."
beth,Are you warm enough?
terry,"Yeah, yeah. I've got my two pairs of socks on."
beth,Do you mind?
terry,No... no...
beth,I'm glad we're going home tomorrow.
terry,Me too. See? I should have brushed my teeth.
beth,I like it. 109
emily,"When something like this happens, there's this sort of expectation that you're going to have this completely new lease on life and feel totally different about everything. Like cherish every sunrise. And for the most part I just feel like, ugh I can't get up that early. I'm sorry, I feel like I've been talking about myself so much. Are you doing a lot of stand-up?"
kumail,"Yeah, I bombed my Montreal Comedy Festival audition, like horrifically."
emily,"I saw the video. It wasn't great. I'll be honest with you, it wasn't great."
kumail,I know.
emily,But there was a lot I liked. Like a lot I liked.
kumail,I'm moving to New York.
emily,Really?
kumail,Yeah. Mary and CJ and I are just gonna drive out. We have a place already.
emily,When do you leave?
kumail,Next weekend.
emily,I'm so excited for you. That is great. I think you are going to do so great in New York. 110
kumail,What were you going to say?
emily,What?
kumail,You said you were going to say something to me. What was it?
emily,"Oh, just that I wanted to thank you. My parents told me everything you did for me and I feel like the last time we spoke I didn't properly thank you so-"
kumail,Oh yeah. Totally fine.
emily,I should probably go.
kumail,Do you wanna call an Uber?
emily,"No, I'm gonna walk actually. This has been really great. Okay, bye."
chris,The scene is gonna be so different with you guys gone.
kumail,You should... come out...
chris,Nah. I'm good here. I'm gonna miss you.
kumail,I'm gonna miss you.
chris,"Get out of here, you assholes."
mary,"Come here, you big dummy."
azmat,"You are still kicked out of the family, but because we did not get a proper chance to say bye to you... Your mother is so angry with you. She is not going to get out of the car. She's not even going to look at you. And I don't believe you kept so much secret from me, your father."
kumail,I'm sorry.
azmat,Here. She asked me to give this to you.
kumail,Thank you Ma.
azmat,Right now? No.
kumail,I'll miss you.
azmat,"I am forbidden from hugging you. So. It was nice to have you as my son. Goodbye forever. And do me a favor, when you reach New York, just text us and tell us that you've reached safely, okay? 112"
kumail,"Dad, can I ask you something? When you and Mom went on your first date, what movie did you see?"
azmat, Satte pe Satta.
kumail,Just curious.
kumail,"So the first time I came to America, I was fourteen and I was just visiting my uncle in New York and it just happened to be Thanksgiving. On my first day in America, my uncle took me to the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and I was like, this is every day in America! As advertised. Every day they have a party celebrating Garfield. No day has lived up to that day. So I was lying to my parents, I was telling them I was gonna be a lawyer. And they're very disappointed cause they wanted me to be a doctor. And you guys are like, why didn't you just tell them that you wanted to be a doctor?  113"
emily,Oh that wasn't a heckle. I just kind of woo-hooed you.
kumail,Well see that's a common misconception. Heckling doesn't have to be negative.
emily,"So if I was like, oh my god, you're amazing in bed! That would be a heckle?"
kumail,"Yeah, and now you're getting more laughs than me, and I don't like that. Do you want to come up, do my job? Are you from out of town, m'am?"
emily,Chicago.
kumail,Ooh Windy City. And what brings you to New York?
emily,I'm here to see someone.
kumail,"And have you seen him? Or her, I mean I don't know what your deal is."
emily,"Yeah, I've seen him."
