Speaker,Dialogue
jan,There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
hana,I'm not sewing anything else.
jan," You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk."
hana,No!
jan,"Hana, I know you do!"
hana,I'm not sewing anything else for you!
jan, I love you.
kip,Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
hardy,Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL!
hardy," Good, that's good, just stay still for me and then we're going to be fine."
hardy,What are you doing?!  What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?
hana,Do you need something?
mary,"Are you okay?  Oh God, Hana, you were like sisters."
hana, We keep moving him - in and out of the truck.  Why?  He's dying.  What's the point?
mary,"Well, we can't hardly leave him.  Do you mean leave him?  We can't."
hana,"I must be a curse.  Anybody who loves me, anybody who gets close to me - or I must be cursed.  Which is it?"
hana,The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
oliver,It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
hana,When he dies I'll catch up.
oliver,"It's not safe here.  The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us.  Hana -"
hana,I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
oliver, And what if he really is a spy?
hana, He can't even move.
oliver,If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
oliver,We're heading for Leghorn.  Livorno the Italians call it.  We'll expect you.
hana,Up there.
the patient,"There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince?"
hana,"Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!"
hana,In here.
hana,Thank you.
hana,Good.
madox, What's this?
madox,"Excellent.  That's terrific, D'Ag.  Toss that up, would you."
madox," My God, look at this!"
bermann,"Incredible, Hmm?  Quite incredible."
almsy, Which means we're in the wrong place.
almsy,Would you stockpile water near to an Oasis?  There can't be a natural spring within fifty miles of here.
fouad,Or they didn't know of one.
bermann,"So, it may not be Zerzura, still incredible."
almsy,A wild goose chase.
madox, No.
madox,No.  Now we look in the other places. We're eliminating.
madox,"Good, and here comes reinforcements."
clifton,I hereby Christen us the International Sand Club!
madox,Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
clifton, Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
madox,We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap.
katharine, Geoffrey gave me your monograph when I was reading up on the desert. Very impressive.
almsy, Thank you.
katharine,I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
almsy,"A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.  Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car."
clifton, A broken car?
almsy,Still a car.
cliffton," Not much use, though."
katharine,"Love?  Romantic love, platonic love, filial love - ?  Quite different things, surely?"
almsy, There you have me.
the patient,What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
hana,I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
the patient,Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
hana,"I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?"
the patient," My book?  The Herodotus?  Yes, we can read him."
hana,Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard!
the patient,Thank you.
the patient,The plumness of this plum.
the patient,What's that?
hana,"Water!  You hear it, too, don't you!"
fouad,"European, I think, with guides."
clifton, How do you know?
madox," Yes, and I think I know who this is."
madox, Fenelon-Barnes.
almsy,"Yes, I think a sailor can call himself an explorer, can't he?  Or should Columbus have swum to America?"
madox,"I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England."
clifton,Apprentices.
madox,This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
katharine,Hello.
madox," Anyway, my friend here has a new theory - that Zerzura doesn't exist.  So we may all be chasing windmills.  Have some food."
katharine,Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
almsy,What kind of fossils?
almsy,I think you know I am.
almsy, Excuse me.
katharine,I can't sing.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it...
almsy,I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
madox,Your book.  Your Herodotus!
katharine," One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -"
almsy, Daskylus...
katharine," Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is.  And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?"
hana," I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules."
the patient,Candaules
hana, Candaules...you're laughing at me.
the patient,"I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please."
hana,"When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure..."
katharine," And that evening, it's exactly as the King had told him, she goes to the chair and removes her clothes, one by one, until she stand naked in full view of Gyges.  And indeed she was more lovely than he could have imagined."
katharine,"But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows.   And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -"
clifton,Off with his head!
katherine,"#NAME? death for gazing on that which you should not, or else kill my husband who shamed me and become King in his place."
katherine,So Gyges killed the King and married the Queen and became ruler of Lydia for twenty eight years.  The End.  Do I spin the bottle?
madox, And let that be a lesson to you!
hana,Are you asleep?
the patient, Yes.  Dropping off.
madox,What did you think you were doing in his tent?
almsy,Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
madox, You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
almsy,Her hands and feet were tied.
madox,What did you do?
almsy,"I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard."
madox,I was talking about the girl.
almsy,"Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel."
hana,"I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery."
the patient,I can already see.
hana, How?  How can you see anything?
the patient,"Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils."
hana,I'm turning you.
the patient,"Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?"
hana,No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
the patient,I can see my wife in that view.
hana,Are you remembering more?
the patient,Could I have a cigarette?
hana,Are you crazy?
the patient,Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
hana,Because I'm a nurse.
hana,How are you?
boy,Okay.
hana,Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
boy,You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
hanna, I don't think so.
boy,Would you kiss me?
hana,"No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there."
boy, Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
hana, Would it?
boy,Thank you.
hana, Very funny.  Go to sleep.
mary,Don't ask.
hana,Where are we going?  I don't want to be kissing in a crowd.  I have six hours.
stuart, Whoa - give me a chance!
hana,Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
stuart,"I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private."
hana,I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
stuart,We can do that when we're very very old.
caravaggio, Buon' Giorno!
caravaggio,Are you Hana?
hana,What do you want?
caravaggio,"I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour."
hana, Bonjour.
caravaggio,"I'd like to take credit, but it's from Mary.  My name's David Caravaggio, but nobody ever called me David. Caravaggio they find to absurd to miss out on."
caravaggio,"They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg in...have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens.  Who separates them?"
hana,You were in Africa?
caravaggio,"Yeah, for a while."
hana,So was my Patient.
caravaggio,"I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  #NAME? relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that."
hana,So you can shoot a pistol?
caravaggio, No.
hana,If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
caravaggio,"I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house.  We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep."
hana,"Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at."
caravaggio,Fine.  I'm not looking.
hana,There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
the patient,Why?  Can he lay eggs?
hana,He's Canadian.
the patient, Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
hana,He needn't disturb you.
the patient,Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
hana,He won't disturb us then.  I think he's after morphine.  There's a war.  Where you come from becomes important.  And besides - we're vulnerable here.  I keep hearing noises in the night.  Voices.
almsy,How much did you pay?
katharine, Hello!  Good morning.
almsy,They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
katharine,"Seven pounds, eight, I suppose.  Why?"
almsy,Which stall?
katharine,Excuse me?
almsy,"You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back."
katharine, I don't want to go back.
almsy,"This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton."
katharine,I don't care to bargain.
almsy,That insults them.
katharine," I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow.  You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?"
almsy, How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
katharine,Excuse me.
clifton,"Gentlemen, good evening!"
clifton,"Uh, marvelous.  She's in love with the hotel plumbing.  She's either in the swimming pool - she swims for hours, she's a fish, quite incredible - or she's in the bath.  Actually, she's just outside.  Chaps Only in the Long Bar."
madox," Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace."
clifton,"Oh no, really.  She has her book."
madox,I won't hear of it.  None of us will.
madox,"Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us.  We're not accustomed to the company of women."
katharine,"Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann."
clifton,"The team is in mourning, darling."
katharine,Oh really?
madox,I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
katharine,How awful.  What will you do?
madox,"A more modest expedition, or even wait a year.  Remind our families we still exist."
clifton," Good heavens, are you married, Madox?"
madox,"Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here."
clifton,"I feel much better, don't you darling? We were feeling rather self-conscious. Let's toast, then.  To absent wives."
katharine, And future ones.
katharine,Why did you follow me yesterday?
almsy,Excuse me?
katharine,"After the market, you followed me to the hotel."
almsy,"I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to."
katharine,You felt obliged to.
almsy,As the wife of one of our party.
katharine," So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it?"
clifton,"I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -"
katharine," Darling, for goodness' sake!"
clifton,"Well, she is!"
caravaggio,Hello.
the patient,Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
caravaggio,"Thief, I think, is more accurate."
the patient,I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
caravaggio,"Oh, all over."
the patient,All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
hana,Then I'm definitely going.
caravaggio,Does she have war wounds?
the patient,I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
caravaggio,Are you planning to be the exception?
the patient,"Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name."
caravaggio,And you've forgotten yours.
the patient,I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
caravaggio,I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
officer,Do you remember where you were born?
the patient,"Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way."
officer,Why?  Are you German?
the patient,No.
officer,How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
the patient,"You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France."
officer,This was your garden?
the patient,Or my wife's.
officer,Then you were married?
the patient,I think so.  Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
the patient,"Thank you.  I've got this much lung...the rest of my organs are packing up - what could it possibly matter if I were Tutankhamun?  I'm a bit of toast, my friend - butter me and slip a poached egg on top."
stuart,My leave is canceled.  I can't meet you later.
hana,Excuse me -
the patient,Yes?
hana,"Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?"
the patient,Your friend?
hana,He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
the patient,Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
hana,"No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get."
the patient,Well then - yes.  Of course.
hana,Thank you.  Thank you.
hana,This is Captain McGann.
the patient,"Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -"
stuart,Thanks.
the patient,I'm going to sing.  If I sing I shan't hear anything.
hana, You've got a mustache.
stuart,A bit of one.
hana,I was looking forward to this evening.
stuart, I had a hotel room.
stuart,I'm feeling old.
caravaggio,Supper.
hana,Where've you been?
caravaggio, Rabbit hunting.
hana,I could help you.  I could get you off that.
caravaggio,Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
hana,"It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -"
caravaggio, You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out?
hana,What do you do?  What are you doing here?
caravaggio,"Some gave me a dress.  You know what's great?  What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that."
the patient,Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
hana,"He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it."
the patient,That's a different dress.
hana,He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
the patient,Do I recognize him?  I recognize what he is. I like him.  He's Canadian.  He can read Italian.  He can catch rabbits.
katharine, Hello.  Not to interrupt but we're celebrating.
almsy,"This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry."
katharine,"What do you mean, poetry?"
almsy,"A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear."
katharine,Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
almsy,"The Ostrich is a detour.  A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method.  Nothing to do with Zerzura.  To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move.  The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run.  At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards.  When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer.  Haunting the ostrich."
almsy,"Yes, the ostrich, it will feed a family, not just the meat, but by selling the feathers, beak, the skin, a year from this one animal.  So, each day the man gets closer.  And the ostrich is not sure - has something changed? - now the standing man is only a few yards from where it feeds.  And then one day, the man is in the wadi, in the water.  And the Ostrich comes, as always, dips into the water and the man JUMPS UP - and captures it."
katharine,"What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?"
almsy,He said - be careful.
katharine,Be careful?  You mean you - or me?  Who?
almsy, Her or me?
almsy,The one who appears not to be moving.
clifton,"Gentlemen, to Zerzura."
all,Zerzura.
madox,"And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund-raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels."
clifton,To arm-twisting.
madox, Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
clifton,Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
katharine,"Darling, Peter says I could stay..."
madox, Why not?
almsy,What kind of photographs?
clifton,"Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing."
katharine, Why do you think?  About my staying?
clifton,"Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft..."
katharine, Oh.
clifton,But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life.  I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
almsy,Safe journey.
clifton,You too.  Good luck!
almsy,Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
clifton,Appropriate?
almsy,"I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her."
clifton,Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
almsy,"All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -"
clifton,"I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself."
almsy,Very well.
clifton, Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
katharine,"I've been thinking about - how does somebody like you decide to come to the desert?  What is it?  You're doing whatever you're doing - in your castle, or wherever it is you live, and one day, you say, I have to go to the desert - or what?"
almsy,"I once traveled with a terrific guide, who was taking me to Faya.  He didn't speak for nine hours.  At the end of it he pointed at the horizon and said - Faya!  That was a good day!"
katharine,"Actually, you sing."
almsy,Pardon?
katharine,You sing.  All the time.
almsy,I do not.
katharine,Ask Al Auf.
katharine," I'll be down to get you in the taxi, honey, you'd better be ready about half-past eight...!"
al auf,"Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar..."
almsy,Madox!  Madox!
madox," My God, they're swimming!"
bermann,"I love the desert, you see.  That's my, that's my - I can't think of the word.  How do you explain?  To someone who's never been here?  Feelings which seem quite normal."
almsy," I don't know, my friend.  I don't know."
madox,I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
almsy,"Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack.  We planned badly."
madox, Bermann!
kamal,May God make safety your companion.
katharine,"I shall stay behind, of course"
madox,Certainly not.
katharine,"I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us."
almsy,What's this?
katharine,I thought you might paste them into your book.
almsy,"We took several photographs, there's no need."
katharine,I'd like you to have them.
almsy, There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
katharine," And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would."
almsy,You should come into the shelter.
katharine,"I'm quite all right, thank you."
almsy,Look over there.
katharine,What am I looking at?
almsy,See what's happening to them - the stars.
katharine,They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
almsy,In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
katharine,"This is not very good, is it?"
almsy,No.
katharine,Shall we be all right?
almsy,Yes.  Absolutely.
katharine,Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
almsy,"#NAME? Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood."
katharine,Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood.  Go on.  More.
almsy,"All true.  Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised."
katharine,"Our tracks, where are they?"
almsy,"Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around."
katharine," Oh my God, the others!"
almsy," Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored."
katharine,"Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?"
almsy, There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
katharine,Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
almsy,Kamal is passing blood.  He must have had some internal damage in the crash. He needs medicine.  I think we must risk the other flare.
katharine, He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present.  It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
almsy,And the marriage - is that a fiction?
katharine,"No, the marriage isn't a fiction."
katharine,"Thank God.  Oh, thank God."
katharine,Do they know them?
almsy," No, but I think I do."
katharine,Am I K. in your book? I think I must be.
katharine, Hello.
katharine,Will you not come in?
almsy,No.
katharine,Will you please come in?
almsy, Mrs. Clifton -
katharine,Don't.
almsy,I believe you still have my book.
katharine,You still have sand in your hair.
katharine,I'm impressed you can sew.
almsy,Good.
katharine,You sew very badly.
almsy,You don't sew at all!
katharine,"A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes."
almsy, That makes it harder still.
almsy,When were you most happy?
katharine,Now.
almsy,When were you least happy?
katharine, Now.
almsy,Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
katharine,"What do I love?  I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths."
almsy,What else?
katharine,Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband.
almsy,What do you hate most?
katharine,A lie.  What do you hate most?
almsy,"Ownership.  Being owned.  When you leave, you should forget me."
the patient,"Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry."
hana," Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me."
hana,I'm so sorry.
mary,"Okay, Type Os, the vampires wait. Everybody's giving a pint."
jan,Ugh!  If they were sucking it out I wouldn't mind.  It's the needle I can't stand.
hana, You're a nurse - how ca you be frightened of needles!
wounded soldier,Can't wait to have me dead?  You bitch!
hana,Try t be calm.  Ssssshhh.  Come on. Be calm now.  Ssshhhh.  Be peaceful. It's okay.  It's okay.
canadian soldier, Is there anybody here from Picton?
oliver,Picton?  I don't know.
canadian soldier,I'd like to see somebody from home before I go.
oliver,"He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?"
hana, As him what company he's with?
oliver,Third Canadian Fusiliers.
hana,Does he know a Captain McGann?
canadian soldier,He bought it.  Yesterday.  Shot to bits.
hana,What did he say?
oliver, Doesn't know him.
hana,"He's gone, hasn't he?"
oliver,No.  He's - no.
hana,Oh God.  Oh God.
caravaggio,Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
hana, Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
caravaggio, I'll have some of your water.  It's hot.
caravaggio," You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is."
hana,I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he.  He's in love with ghosts.
caravaggio,Who are his ghosts?
hana,Ask him.
caravaggio, What if I told you he did this to me?
hana, What?  How could he have?  When?
caravaggio,I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
hana,I don't know what that means.
caravaggio, Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
hana, Please don't creep around this house.
hana,"Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire...  Who is K?"
the patient,K is for Katharine.
almsy,Say you're sick.
katharine,What?  No!
almsy,Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
katharine, No.
almsy,I can't work.  I can't sleep.
lady hampton,Katharine!
katharine,"Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night.  Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma."
almsy,I can still taste you.
katharine," This is empty, just coming!"
almsy,I'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth.  Swoon.  I'll catch you.
katharine,I'm fine.  How silly.
officer's wife, It's the heat.
lady hampton,"You should sit down, darling.  Are you pregnant?"
katharine,I don't think so.
lady hampton, How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
katharine,I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
lady hampton,I'll come with you.
katharine,"No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine."
clifton,Have you seen Katharine?
almsy, What?
clifton,It's Geoffrey under this.
almsy,"I haven't, no.  Sorry."
clifton,"Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?"
katharine,I'm fine.  I got hot.
clifton,Lady H said she thought you might be -
katharine,I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
clifton,Right.
katharine,Aren't you?
clifton,"Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home."
katharine,"Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face?  It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted."
clifton,"Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war."
katharine," Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise."
clifton,I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
katharine,What?
clifton,Marzipan!  I think you've got marzipan in your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.
the patient,Are you outside?
caravaggio,I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder.
caravaggio,Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
the patient,"I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain.  I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face."
caravaggio,"Is it you?  If I said Moose... I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?"
the patient, Moose.
caravaggio, First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
the patient,I don't know.  Paper.  Is it?  Paper?  I don't remember.
the patient,I have come to love that little tap of the fingernail against the syringe.  Tap.
hana,Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
kip,The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
hana,I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German.
kip,Is something funny?
hana,"No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  #NAME? worried about mines.  That's all."
kip,I've met you before.
hana,I don't think so.
hana,"He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban."
the patient,"Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh."
hana,I'll probably marry him.
the patient,Really?  That's sudden.
hana,My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
hana,I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
the patient,Why?  Is he staying?
hana,With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
the patient,We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
hana,They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job.  They won't stay in the house.  They're putting up their tent in the garden.
the patient,"In that case, I suppose we can't charge."
clifton," Okay my precious, I love you."
rupert,I didn't know you were going anywhere?
clifton,"I'm not.  I'm going to surprise her. It's our anniversary.  She's forgotten, of course.  What's the symbol for your first anniversary?  I should get something. Is it paper?  Moose!  Moose, you there?  First Anniversary - is it cotton?"
caravaggio,Is what cotton?
clifton,First Wedding Anniversary.
rupert, He's hopeless!
clifton,"Your day will come, my sausage."
caravaggio,Your first anniversary is Paper.
clifton,Stop!
cabbie,Please?
clifton,Stop here.
cabbie,Yessir.
katharine,This is - what is this?
almsy,It's a folk song.
katharine,Arabic?
almsy,"No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me."
katharine, It's beautiful.  What's it about?
almsy," It's a long song - Szerelem means love...and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool.  For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what?  And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -"
almsy, Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
katharine,"You bastard, I was believing you!"
almsy,"I claim this shoulder blade - oh no, wait - I want this!"
almsy,"This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous."
katharine, I can stay tonight.
almsy,"Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat."
katharine,This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
almsy,Yes.  A different wife.
clifton,Sorry.
cabbie,"Hotel now, sir?"
geoffrey,No.
almsy,"I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing."
katharine,"That day, had you followed me to the market?"
almsy,Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
katharine, Shall we be all right?
almsy,Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.
caravaggio, Thought you'd never wake up!
the patient,What?
hana,Where did you find that?
caravaggio,I liberated it.
hana,I think that's called looting.
caravaggio, No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
the patient,Irving Berlin.
caravaggio,For?
the patient,Top Hat.
caravaggio,Is there a song you don't know?
hana, No.  He sings all the time.
hana,Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
the patient,I've been told that before.
hana,Kip's another one.
hana,Hello.
hardy,Hello miss.
hana,"I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever... you and Lieutenant Singh..."
hardy,"Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -"
hana,"Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please."
hardy,I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
hana,You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall.  You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
hardy, A toddler
hana,"Sorry, is it all right I'm seeing this?"
hana,My hair was long.  At some point. I've forgotten what a nuisance it is to wash.  You know - if you were ever around - we get water from the pump at noon.
hana,Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
kip,Thank you.
kip,For my hair?
hana," Yes, for your hair."
kip,Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
the patient,#NAME? natives called the Lahore Museum.
kip,"It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum.  It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives."
the patient,So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
kip,"What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British."
the patient,"Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I."
hana,Arguing about books.
the patient,Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
kip, I'll get another tin.
hana,I didn't like that book either.  It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
the patient,"You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes."
hana,"I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me."
the patient,I don't think it's indifference.
the patient,Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
hana, Hey! -
the patient,#NAME?
kip,"Well, I'm indifferent to cooking, not Hana's cooking in particular.  Have either of you ever tried condensed milk sandwiches?"
the patient, Careful - careful!
the patient,This is wonderful!
kip, What's he saying?
hana,He's saying it's wonderful!
madox, And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
almsy,"No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility..."
madox,Which we've overflown twice.
almsy,"Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura."
madox,"So - on Thursday you don't trust Bell's map - Bell was a fool, Bell couldn't draw a map, but on Friday he's suddenly infallible?"
madox,And where are the Expedition Maps?
almsy,In my room.
madox,"Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of."
almsy,What's the matter with you?
madox,Don't be so bloody nave.  You know there's a war breaking out.  This arrived this morning.  By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be
almsy,Why do they care about our maps?
madox,"What do we find in the desert?  Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa."
almsy, Own the desert.
almsy,That place at the base of a woman's throat?  You know - the hollow - here - does that have an official name?
madox,"For God's sake, man - pull yourself together."
soldier,"Beggin your pardon, miss, but have you got a lighter?"
soldier," I love Ginger, she's a foxy girl, ain't she?"
katharine,Fuck off.
soldier,What?
katharine,You heard me.
almsy,Sorry.
katharine,"I can't do this, I can't do this any more."
katharine,I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
almsy,"I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not."
katharine,"I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him."
almsy,"Don't go over it again, please."
almsy,Katharine -
almsy,I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet.
katharine,You will.  You will.
the patient,I'm still here.
hana,You'd better be.
the patient,"Don't depend on it.  Will you? That little bit of air, each day there's less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right."
the patient, I've been talking to Caravaggio - my research assistant - there's meant to be a ghost in the Cloisters.  I can join him!
the patient,It's the boy.
kip,Go to the left!  Keep to the left!  There are mines and trip wires everywhere!
kip,Get Hardy.  He's on the other side of town.  In the hills.  Get him to hurry.
hana,It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
kip,"The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them."
hana,What do I do?
kip,"There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over."
hana,So I follow the wires?
kip,You get Hardy.
hana,I follow the wires.
kip,Don't touch them.
hana,Why would anyone do this?
kip,I've done this.  I've had to do this.
hana,Give me a second.
kip,What are you doing?!  Hana!
kip,What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
hana,I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  I hope we don't die.
kip,Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
hana,I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
kip,You must get away.  Before I cut.  I'm not cutting if you're here.
hana,"Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers."
kip,No.
hana,Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
kip,"Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and then cut.  Hana checks, lies down.  He bends as close to the ground as he dares AND KISSES HER, THEN SHE IMMEDIATELY CUTS."
the patient,Hana!  Hana!  Kip!  Hana!
hana,"I'm sorry.  I forgot you'd be worrying. We're all safe.  It was a mine, but not the mine.  Nobody's hurt.  I'm sorry."
soldier,And you're definitely traveling with him of your own free will?
hana,Yes.
soldier, Just wanting to be sure.  And he's taking you to church?
hana, Yes.  We're going to a funeral.  A cow has died.  And in his religion they're sacred.
hana,Kip?
the patient,There was a general who wore a patch over a perfectly good eye.  The men fought harder for him.  Sometimes I think I could get up and dance. What's under your bandages?
caravaggio,Hold the ends.
aicha,He's waiting for you.
caravaggio,"We have 30, 000 troops in Tobruk. What are they going to be doing?"
mller," Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
mller,David Caravaggio.
caravaggio,No.
mller,"Petty thief, six months imprisonment"
caravaggio," I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you."
mller,Is this you?
caravaggio,I don't know.
mller,It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41.  And so was
caravaggio,It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
mller,You are a Canadian spy working for the Allies.  Code-name Moose.
caravaggio,Could I have a doctor?  I am passing blood.  I must be bleeding internally.  He kicks me.  He kicks me all the time.
clerk, He's asking for a doctor.
mller, You want a doctor?
caravaggio,"Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -"
mller,"We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse."
caravaggio,"A nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse?  Great."
mller, Leave it and get the nurse!
mller, It's too hot.
caravaggio,"I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble."
mller,"I'll tell you what I'm going to do.  This is your nurse, by the way.  She's Moslem, so she'll understand all of this.  What's the punishment for adultery?  Let's leave it at that.  You're married and you were fucking another woman, so that's - is it the hands that are cut off? Or is that for stealing?  Does anyone know?"
mller,"Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?"
caravaggio,Don't cut me.
mller,Or was it Toronto?
caravaggio, Don't cut me.  Come on.
mller,"Ten fingers.  How about this?  You give me a name for every finger - doesn't matter who.  I get something, you keep something.  I'm trying to be reasonable.  Fenelon-Barnes, we could call that two names.  Is a thumb a finger?"
mller,I get no help from these people.
clerk, The telephone -
mller, What are you doing?
stenographer, That Geneva Convention.  I'm -
caravaggio,You can't do that!  Hey - come on!
mller,Go!  Hey!  Go!
caravaggio,Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
caravaggio," Listen, I'll give you a name.  What name did you say?  I knew them! I promise.  Please - please!"
mller,Cut the other thumb.
mller,This one!  Come on!
caravaggio,"The man who took my thumbs, I found him eventually - he's dead.  The man who took my photograph, I found him too - that took me a year.  He's dead.  Another man took that man across the desert to Cairo.  Now I intend to find him."
almsy,I believe I'm rather late.
madox," Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface."
the others,The International Sand Club!
almsy," Misfits, buggers, fascists, and paedophiles.  God bless us every one."
almsy,Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Fhrer!  Il Duce.
clifton,"Sorry, what's your point?"
almsy, Isn't that right?
almsy,What's my point?  Oh!  I've invented a new dance - the Bosphorus Hug.  Anybody up to it? Madox?  D'Ag?  Come on D'Aggers.
almsy,"...We'll bathe at Brighton, the fish we'll frighten when we're in.  your bathing suit so thin will make the shellfish grin, fin to fin. --  Those were the words - actually - before they were cleaned up.  Could be a song for you, Mrs. Clifton -  #NAME?"
madox,"Look, either shut up, or go home."
almsy,Why did you hold his collar?
katharine,What?
almsy," What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?"
katharine,Would you let me pass?
almsy,Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
katharine,Don't do this.
almsy,"I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?"
katharine,You know why?
almsy,Dance with me.
katharine,No.
almsy,Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
katharine,Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
the patient,Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
hana,Would you like me to?
hardy,I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
hana,He's sleeping.
hardy,Only we have to go to work.
hana,I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
hardy,A bomb.  At the Viaduct.
hana,Does he have to go?
hardy,Pardon me?
hana,"What if you couldn't find him...?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning."
kip,What's happening?  Am I needed?
hardy,"I'm afraid so, sir."
hana,"Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man."
kip,This is what I do.  I do this every day.
kip,Hardy!  Hardy!  What's happening?!
hardy,Corporal!?  Dade!!
dade,"Tanks, sir.  Don't know what it's about. God only knows."
hardy, What is this - a bloody carnival? Stop them!
hardy,"You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last."
kip,Go away.
hardy,Yessir.
kip,This is making me incredibly angry.
kip,Kiss me.
dade,"It's over, Sarge.  It's over.  Jerry's surrendered.  Sir, congratulations!"
kip,Congratulations.
hana,Kip!
hana,Kip - come and dance with me
kip, Yes.  Later.
caravaggio,Have a drink.
the patient,I've had a drink.  Fatal.
caravaggio,"Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -"
the patient,Very true!
the patient,Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
hana,Never heard of it.
the patient,That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club.
caravaggio, What?  You and Madox?  Or you and Katharine Clifton?
the patient, What?
hana, What was that?
spalding,"Booby trap.  They was running up the Union Jack, sir, up off that statue - It just went off."
dade,"Should have been me.  It was my idea but Sergeant Hardy climbed up, sir, him and Blackler."
spalding,Sir - you don't want to look.
kip,Who's that girl?
dade,"His fiancee, sir."
kip, Hardy's?
dade,Kept it a bit dark.
kip,"I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some -  and us - he never once... He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about."
hana,You loved him.
hana,"If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do? KIP I try not to expect you."
hana,But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
kip,Then I'd think there must be a reason.
hana,You wouldn't come to find me?  That makes me never want to come here.
hana,"Then I tell myself he spends all day searching, in the night he wants to be found."
madox,"Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still..."
almsy,Right.
madox,"Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but...  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so."
almsy,I told you so.
madox,"We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that."
almsy,Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
madox, When's Clifton picking you up?
almsy,Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
madox,I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis.  So if you need it...hard to know how long one's talking about.  We might all be back in a month or two.
madox,I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
almsy,"Goodbye, my friend."
madox,May God make safety your companion.
almsy, But I hope someone looks after you.
madox,In case you're still wondering - this is called the supasternal notch.
madox,Come and visit us in Dorset.  When all this nonsense is over.  You'll never come to Dorset.
hana,Sometimes I need you to find me.
the patient,Hana tells me you're leaving.
caravaggio," There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?"
the patient,We shall miss you.
caravaggio,"So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  #NAME? full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you."
the patient,Me?
caravaggio,"I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name."
the patient,I see.
caravaggio,"Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression."
the patient,And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
caravaggio,"You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing."
the patient,I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
caravaggio,What did you say?
the patient,The rest meant nothing to me.
caravaggio,There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
the patient,"Thousands of people did die, just different people."
caravaggio,"But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?"
the patient, Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.
almsy,"Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?"
katharine, I can't move.  I can't get out.
almsy,Why did he bring you?
katharine,"A surprise, he said."
katharine,"Poor Geoffrey.  He knew.  He must have known all the time.  He was shouting - I love you, Katharine, I love you so much.  Is he badly hurt? His neck is odd."
katharine,Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
almsy,We've got to get you out of here.
katharine,It hurts too much.
almsy," I know, darling, I'm sorry."
katharine, Why did you hate me?
almsy,What?
katharine,Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
almsy,Don't talk.
katharine, You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
almsy, You're wearing the thimble.
katharine,Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
katharine,It's so cold.
almsy,I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
katharine, Don't leave me!
almsy,I'm just going to find things for the fire.
katharine,Shall we be all right?
almsy,Yes.  Absolutely.
katharine, Oh dear.
almsy," Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you."
katharine,"Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns.  Very English.  And I know exactly where I want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where I grew up.  With a view of the sea.  So promise me you'll come back for you."
almsy,I promise I'll come back.  I promise I'll never leave you.  And there's plenty of water and food.  You can have a party.
almsy,And a good read.  Don't waste it.
katharine,Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
almsy,"I'm sorry, Katharine."
katharine,I know.
almsy,Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again.
almsy,Tell me about your garden.
katharine, Darling.  My darling.
officer,Good morning!
almsy,Could I trouble you for some water?
officer," So, golly, where have you come from?"
almsy, I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
officer,I see.
almsy, Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
officer,"Do you have your papers, sir?"
almsy,What?
officer,If I could just see some identification.
almsy,"Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society."
officer,"Right.  And what's your name, sir?"
almsy,Count Laszlo de Almsy.
officer,Almsy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
almsy,"Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!"
officer, I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
almsy," No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!"
almsy," Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!"
corporal,Shut-up!
almsy,"Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake.  Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying."
corporal,"Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding."
almsy,Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
corporal,"That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?"
almsy,"Let me out, let me out, let me out - Katharine!  Katharine!"
almsy,Excuse me.  I also need to use the lavatory.
soldier,You'll have to wait.  Sarge!  Jerry wants to use the lav - says it's urgent.
almsy,"Where are we going, please?"
soldier,To the coast.  Benghazi.  Soon be there. Get a boat home.  You'll be all right.
sergeant,What's up?
almsy,Cramps.  It's urgent.
sergeant,Go on then - you take him.
the patient,So yes.  She died because of me. Because I loved her.  Because I had the wrong name.
hana,What are you up to?
kip,"That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns."
kip,"When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away."
hana,"I should go to the house, get breakfast."
kip,The lamp was burning all night in his room.  Caravaggio was there with him.
kip,This is hot!
hana, Nya-nya-nya!
caravaggio,And did you never see Katharine?  You never got back to the Cave?
the patient,"Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't... I couldn't even do that properly."
caravaggio,"You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel."
the patient,You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
caravaggio,"No, now I can't kill you."
caravaggio,Kip - what are - ?
kip,Stay out of this.
the patient,Kip?
kip,"I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool.  Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them."
the patient,What are you talking about?
kip,"What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this."
caravaggio,"Kip, listen -"
kip,I said keep out of this!
kip,"Can you hear?  Can you hear what they're celebrating?  I listened to you, Uncle. Sitting at your feet - always sitting at somebody's feet - trying to learn.  The right way to hold a teacup, otherwise you're out, the pukkah knot in your tie - as if everything can be explained in terms of a cricket bat and an accent."
caravaggio,Kip -
kip,Kip! - it's not even my name because you can't say it.  Kirpal Singh Bhuller is my name.
caravaggio,"Well, then ask him his name!"
hana," What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody."
kip,They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city.  Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
the patient," Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more."
caravaggio,"Kip, listen, he lost everything because he wasn't English - Jesus! - shoot me, I'm more English than he is!"
hana,Kip.  Kip.  It's me.  I don't understand.  Let me come in.
kip,Will you come with me?
hana,Of course.  When?
kip,I mean home.  India.
hana,Kip... I -
hana,Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
kip,It's what I've learned.
hana,"I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it.  And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us."
hana,I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
hana,I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
kip,I'll always go back to that church.
hana,So one day we'll meet.
the patient,Thank you.  Thank you.
the patient,"Read to me, will you?  Read me to sleep."
almsy,"Katharine, my darling."
almsy,I'm so tired.
hana,"My darling, I'm waiting for you - how long is a day in the dark, or a week?"
caravaggio,Hana!  Come on!
caravaggio,Hana - this is Gioia.
hana,Buon' giorno.
caravaggio,She can take you as far as Florence.
hana,I can get in the back.
