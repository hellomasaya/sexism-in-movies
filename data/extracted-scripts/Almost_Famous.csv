Speaker,Dialogue
elaine,"Excuse me, I'm a teacher.  There is no word in The English Language -- ""Xmas."" It's either Merry Christmas... or Happy Holidays."
william,- so Livia -
elaine,-- killed everyone off so her son Tiberius could inherit the throne.  Just like Nixon.
anita's voice,Hey Mom!  I already ate.
elaine,You sure?  I'm making soy cutlets.
anita,I'm fine.  Already ate.
elaine,Wait.  You've been kissing.
anita, No I haven't.
elaine," Yes... yes, you have..."
anita,No I haven't.
elaine,Yes you have.  I can tell.
anita, You can't tell.
elaine,"Not only can I tell, I know who it is. It's Darryl."
anita, It's unfair that we can't listen to our music!
elaine," Honey, it's all about drugs and promiscuous sex."
anita,Simon and Garfunkel is poetry!
elaine,Yes it's poetry.  It's the poetry of drugs and promiscuous sex.  Look at the picture on the cover...
anita,"First it was butter, then sugar and white flour.  Bacon. Eggs, bologna, rock and roll, motorcycles."
elaine,That was an experiment.  But I understand -
anita,What else are you going to ban?
elaine,"Honey, you want to rebel against knowledge."
anita, We're like nobody else I know.
elaine,I'm a teacher.  Why can't I teach my own kids?  Use me.
anita,"Darryl says you use knowledge to keep me down.  He says I'm a ""yes"" person and you're trying to raise us in a ""no"" environment!"
elaine," Well, clearly, ""no"" is a word Darryl doesn't hear much."
william,Mom --
elaine,Everything I say is wrong.
anita,I can't live here!  I hate you!  Even William hates you!
william,I don't hate her.
anita, You don't even know the truth!
elaine,"Sweetheart, don't be a drama queen."
anita,Feck  you!  All of you!
elaine,Hey!
william,"I think she said ""feck."""
elaine, What's the difference?
william," Well.  The letter ""u""..."
voice, Are you really in our grade?
william,Yeah.
tobin,Hey guys!  Check it out!  William doesn't have any pubes!
tobin,"He's not a man, he's a little baby kid.  He Doesn't even get zits yet."
tobin, Where are your pubes???!!
william, I had 'em.  I shaved 'em off.
elaine, Put on your seatbelt.   I don't want you flying through the windshield.
william,We got our annuals today --
elaine," ""Received"" your annual."
william, I look so much younger than everyone else.
elaine,Enjoy it while you can.
anita,Mom.  It's time.
elaine, Can this wait until we get home?
anita,"Mom, pull over.  Tell him the truth. Tell him how old he is."
elaine, He knows how old he is.
anita,The other kids make fun of him because of How young he looks.  Nobody includes him.
william,They do?
elaine,"What's a ""Narc?"""
anita, A Narcotics Officer!
elaine,Well what's wrong with that?
william, Aren't I?
elaine, I also put you in first grade when you were five and never told you.
william, So...  I'm... how old?
anita,You lied to him!  You make such a big deal about the truth and you lied!
elaine, He never asked.
anita,"What -- like he's going to ask if he's as old as he thinks he is?  Don't you realize, this is going to scar him forever?"
elaine,Honey... sweetheart... don't be Cleopatra.  We have to be his mother and his Dad.
anita,You put too much pressure on him!
william, How... old...
anita,"And when he rebels in some strange and odd way, don't blame me."
william,... am I?
elaine, I skipped you an extra grade.  You're eleven.
william, ELEVEN?
elaine,"So you skipped fifth grade.  There's too  much padding In the grades.  I taught elementary school.  5th grade - unnecessary.  Nothing happens in the 5th grade.  All Teachers know it, no one talks about it."
william, E - leven.
elaine,And you skipped kindergarten because I taught it to you when you were four.
william, This explains... so much...
anita,You've robbed him of an adolescence!
elaine,Adolescence is a marketing tool.
anita,"He's got no ""crowd""... no friends..."
william,Okay!
anita,"Honey, I know you were expecting puberty.  You're just going to have to shine it on for a while."
elaine,"Who needs a ""crowd?""  You're unique.  You're two years ahead of everybody.  Take those extra years and do what you want.  Go to Europe for a year!  Take a look around, see what you like!  Follow your dream! You'll still be the youngest lawyer in the country.  Your own great grandfather practiced law until he was 93.  Your dad was so proud of you.  He knew you were a pronominally accelerated child."
anita,What about me?
elaine, You're rebellious and ungrateful of my love.
anita,"Well, somebody's gotta be normal around here!"
william, Eleven.
anita,"I want to play you a song that explains why I'm leaving, and try to listen."
elaine,We can't talk?  We have to listen to rock music?
william,"Take good care of her in San Francisco, man."
elaine,How can she leave such a loving family?
anita,One day you'll be cool.
elaine,She'll be back.
anita,YEAHHHHH-HOOOOOOOO.
elaine,Maybe not soon...
lester bangs,What is this hippie station?!  Where's Iggy Pop?  Don't you have a copy of Raw Power?!
bangs,Found it!!
bangs,So you're the one who's been sending me those articles from your school newspaper -
william,"I've been doing some stuff for a local underground paper, too."
bangs,What are you like the star of your school?
william,They hate me.
bangs,You'll meet them all again on their long journey to the middle.
william,I did?
bangs,Oh yeah.  It's over.
william,Over?
bangs,"Over.  You got here just in time for the death rattle, the last gasp, the last grope."
william,Well.  At least I'm here for that.
bangs,What do you type on?
william,Smith-Corona Galaxis Deluxe.
bangs,You like the new Lou Reed?
william," The early stuff.  The new stuff, he's trying to be Bowie, he should be himself.  I'm not a big Lou man."
bangs,"Yeah, but if Bowie's doing Lou, and Lou's Doing Bowie, Lou's still doing Lou."
william, If you like Lou.
bangs,Take drugs?
william,No.
bangs,"Smart kid.  I used to do speed and sometimes Nyquil and stay up all night writing and writing, like 25 pages of dribble about, you know, the Guess Who, or Coltrane, just to write, you know, with the music blasting..."
william,Me too.  The writing part...
bangs,"Well, alright.  It's been nice to meet you.  I'll see you around.  Keep sending me your stuff."
william,Okay.  See you.
bangs,I can't stand here all day talking to my many fans.
bangs,"-- so anyway, you're from San Diego and that's good.  Because once you go to L.A., you're gonna have friends like crazy but they'll be fake friends, they're gonna try to corrupt you.  The publicists!  The bands!  You got an honest face, they're gonna tell you everything.  But you CANNOT make friends with the rock stars."
william,... Industry... of... cool...
bangs,"And that's what they want!  And it's happening right now.  I'm telling you, you're coming along at a very dangerous time for rock and roll.  The war is over.  They won.  99% of what passes for rock now... SILENCE is much more compelling.  It's over.  I think you should turn around and go back and be... a lawyer or something... but I can see from your face that you won't. I can pay you thirty-five bucks.  Gimme a thousand words on Black Sabbath."
william, An assignment.
lester,Yeah.  And you should build your reputation on being honest... and unmerciful.
william, Honest... unmerciful...
bangs,And if you get into a jam -- call me. I stay up late.
elaine,Look at this.  An entire generation of Cinderellas and there's no slipper coming.
william,You can drop me off here.
elaine,Black.  Sabbath.  Just remember - you wanted to be Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird.
william,All I have to do is listen.  That's what Lester Bangs said.
elaine," I'll be waiting right here at eleven 'o clock sharp.  If you get lost, use the family whistle."
william,Hi.  I'm William Miller and I'm here from Creem Magazine to interview the band Black Sabbath.
scotty,Not on the list.
william,"Sir, I'm a journalist, and here's a copy of the magazine."
scotty,You're not on the list.   Go to the top of the ramp with the girls!
william, What-happens-after-I-go-to-the-top-of- the-ramp with-the-gi -
estrella,Who are you with?
william, Me?  I'm with myself.
estrella,"No, who are you with?  What band?"
william,I'm here to interview Black Sabbath.  I'm a journalist.  I'm not a... you know...
penny lane,... you're not a what?
william, Oh... I'm just... not a... you know.
penny lane,"Not a ""what""?"
william," You know.  A ""groupie."""
estrella,Ohhh!
william,"Sorry, I -"
penny lane,"We.  Are not.  ""Groupies."""
estrella,"This is Penny Lane, man.  Show some respect."
william,-- sorry.
penny lane,"""Groupies"" sleep with rock stars because they want to be near someone famous. We are here because of the music.  We are Band Aids."
estrella,She used to run a school for Band Aids.
penny lane,We don't have intercourse with these guys.  We support the music.  We inspire the music.  We are here because of the music.
estrella,"Marc Bolan broke her heart, man.  It's famous."
penny lane,It's a long story.  I'm retired now. I'm just visiting friends.
estrella,"She was the one who changed everything. She said ""no more sex, no more exploiting our bodies and hearts... """
william,Right.  Right.
estrella,"""... just blow-jobs, and that's it."""
william,"Okay.  Well, see, now I get the difference."
polexia, It's all happening.  It's all happening.
estrella,Polexia!!   Did you tell Sabbath we were going to be here?
polexia,"I talked to Dick with Stillwater, I talked with Sabbath.  They're all dying to see us.   It's all happening."
penny lane,"This is our journalist friend. Journalist Friend, meet Estrella Starr, and Polexia Aphrodisia. And you are --"
william,William.
polexia,Here comes Sabbath!
estrella,Ozzy!!!  Tony!!!  It's us!!
polexia, Okay.  I was with Ian Hunter all night at Rodney's Last night.  Wanna see his spoo?  I saved it in a baggie.
estrella, I'm really happy he's doing so well.
penny," Yeah.  I know he's such a talented guy.  I mean, look at him.  Who deserves it more?"
polexia, Nobody -- he's so sweet.
estrella," Don't you just root for him, you know. To go that little distance between good and great?"
penny,Wait.  That's not his.  I would know his.
sapphire,Does anybody remember laugh-tah?  Come and GET 'EM!
scotty,Oh no.  Not this one --
sapphire, Who brought Opie?
penny,He's with us.
scotty, He wasn't with you.
sapphire, Are you going to turn this into a Thing?
scotty,All of you can wait outside!  Top of the ramp!
william,I don't want to cause a Thing.  I'll wait.
penny, I'll go take care of this.
dick,"Let us in, we're Stillwater!  We're on the show!!"
william," Hi, I'm a journalist.  I write for Creem Magazine."
jeff,The enemy!  A rock writer!
william, I'd like to interview you or someone from the band.
dick, I'm sorry but could you please fuck off?
william,Okay.  Okay.  I could do that.
jeff,"You guys never listened to our records. You're all just frustrated musicians. Do you know what your magazine SAID about us?  What was it - ""the singer's incessant cater walling distracts From an assault with no clear purpose."""
larry, That was Rolling Stone.
russell,"Yeah.  Okay.  Fuck off anyway.  We play for fans, not critics."
william,Russell.  Jeff.  Ed.   Larry.  Way to go.
russell, Well don't stop there.
jeff,"Yeah, come back here!!  Keep going!"
scotty,Not this one.
russell,He's with us.
scotty,He's not with you.  He's not with them. He's not on the list.  He's not coming in.  And this is my arena.  And furthermore -
russell,Red Dog!
red dog,We're playing here tomorrow night.
jeff," This is Red Dog, the Allman Brothers Band's number one roadie."
russell,How're the guys?
red dog,"Havin a ball, man.  When we have a party, we have an Allman Brothers Band party.  Everybody boogies.  Everybody gets off.  It's family, man.  We all got These now.  Dicky and Gregg send you their love."
russell,"... and it's okay, because rock and roll is a LIFESTYLE...  and a way of thinking and it's not about money and ""popularity!"""
jeff,Some money would be nice.
russell,- but it's a voice that says here I am... and FUCK YOU if you can't understand me.
jeff,And the chicks are great.
russell,"But we didn't do it for that!  We are here because we needed to fuckin be here, not just 'cause we needed to away from Troy, Michigan, WHICH WE DID... but what it all comes down to is that thing. The Indefinable Thing, when people catch something from your music, the thing you put into it.  I'm talking about... what am I talking about?"
william, The buzz?
russell,"THE BUZZ!   And the chicks, the whatever, is an off-shoot of THE BUZZ. And like -- you saying you liked ""Fever Dog?""   That is the fucking buzz, man. All we get are these fucking old-ass interviewers who don't understand, don't LISTEN, don't appreciate why we are here, which is the fuckin' BUZZ."
jeff,The next album will be even better. More texture.
russell,"But... it's not what you put in, is it?  It's what you leave out.  Listen to... listen to Marvin Gaye..."
william," I know that, ""woo."""
russell," That's what you remember.  The silly things, the little things... there's only one, and it makes the song.  It's what you leave out.  That's rock and roll."
jeff, We used to talk more about this stuff.
russell,"Okay.  See, this is maybe the most honest we've ever been in an interview because you know our music.  You're the first press guy we've made friends with.  We don't normally talk like this to them.  And you're supposed to be The Enemy!  What are you - 18?"
william,Yeah.
russell,There you go.  Still young enough to be honest.
dick," Ten minutes 'till showtime, anyone who isn't in the band -- out!"
penny lane,I found you a pass.
william," I've only done two, but you know. He's number one."
penny lane,You're learning.  They're much more fun on the way up.
william,Eighteen.
penny lane,Me too.  How old are we really?
william,Seventeen.
penny lane,Me too.
penny lane,Me too.  Isn't it funny?  The truth just sounds Different.
penny lane,You want to know how old I really am?
william, No.
penny lane,It's a long story.
william, Right.  Right.
penny lane,We live in the same city.  We should be friends.
russell,The Enemy!
william,"Russell, this is Penny Lane."
penny lane, Pleasure.
russell,"Penny Lane?  Like the song, right?"
penny lane,Have we met?
william,"Well, I guess you've... you've met."
dick,Penny Lane!  God's gift to rock and roll!!  You're back!  Marc Bolan.  Please.
russell,"Come on, let's go.  Both of you."
russell,- get in the huddle.
dick,"From Troy, Michigan.  Please welcome --  Stillwater."
russell," So.  You want to come up to L.A., we'll be at the ""Riot House"" all week."
william,"""The Riot House?"""
russell,The Continental Hyatt House!  It's on Sunset Strip.
william, Right.  Right.
dick,Let's blow this burg!
russell," Well tell your friend Miss Penny Lane to Call Me.  Tell her ""It ain't California without her.  We want her around like last summer.""   Say it like that."
william,Got it.
russell," Oh, I'm under the name - Harry Houdini."
jeff," The Enemy!!  Yeah!!    Come to L.A., we'll take some more."
william,"Later Jeff!  See you, Dick.  Larry. Ed.  Mick, Gregg, Red Dog, Scully, Frosty, Estrella, The Wheel!"
william,PENNY!
penny, Hey.  Hey.  Be cool.
william,"You just missed Russell!  He says he's at the ""Riot House"" all week and to call him.  He's under the name Harry Houdini. Do you know about the ""Riot House?"""
penny lane,I think I've heard of it.
william,"He had a message for you!  He said, ""It's not California without you.  We want you around like last summer.""  Actually he said ""ain't.""  ""It ain't California - """
penny lane,I get the gist.
william,How well do you guys know each other?
penny lane,Call me if you need a rescue.  We live in the same city.
william,I think I live in a different world.
penny,Speaking of the world.  I've made a decision.  I'm going to live in Morocco for one year. I need a new crowd.
william,Yes.
penny,It's a plan.  You've got to call me.
william,Okay.
penny,It's all happening.
william,It's all happening.
william,Hey Darryl.
darryl,Hey.
william,"Yeah.  She and Mom are still sorta... I'd say ""not speaking,"" but I don't know if they ever did."
darryl,Your sister.  A stewardess.  The things your sister and I did inside these four walls...
william,That's okay.  I don't want to know. It's my room now.
darryl,We flew the friendly skies -
william,Okay -
darryl,I don't want to put you in the middle of anything.  We don't have to talk about it.
william,No.
darryl,You seem cooler.
william,Yeah.  I'm thinking about going to Morocco.
darryl,Lemme know if you need a little help with your Mom.
william,A little might not be enough.
darryl,She still freaks me out.
william, Yeah -
darryl,She's famous.
william,Listen -
darryl,Go ahead and do what you were doing. I just wanna hang in here for a moment.
william,Cool.  Alright.
darryl,"Okay, man."
william,"Okay, man."
elaine,I worry about the drunk drivers.
william,Mom.  I'm 15.  Right?
elaine,"Yes, you're 15. ""And here's that money I owed you."""
william,I thought it was pretty good.
elaine,Keep the small bills on the outside. And call me if anyone gets drunk.
william,I will call you if anyone anywhere gets drunk.
elaine,Good.
william, And don't take drugs.
elaine, Ha ha.  Very funny.  See -- sense of humor.  Have fun at the dance.  I'm glad you're making friends.
william,Mom?
elaine,Yeah -
william, Stay.
elaine,Oh... okay.
william,I-love-you-bye.
penny lane,"The Continental Hyatt House.  Also known as The Riot House.  Every band stays here, all the ones that matter.  The Who.  Zeppelin. Alice.  Bowie.  English bands.  American bands.  We all know each other.  Twenty- four hour room service.  Like us, they were outsiders.  They were so outside, they're inside, and insiders never even knew it, because they're outsiders and they are inside a place outsiders will never be.  And why are we even talking about it?  If you're really an insider, you're never gonna say it. You know what I mean?"
william, Yeah.  Yes.
penny,"And we're not gonna hang out with Russell.  You can, but not me."
william,What is it with you and Russell?
penny lane,It's all happening.  And I'm about to use you as protection.
penny lane, These guys are with Alice Cooper.  I'm going to pretend I don't know them.
penny lane,"I'm just showing my very dear, very wonderful friend around.  He's a very important writer - he knows Lester Bangs.  I'm responsible for his moral conduct while he's abroad."
penny lane,I'm retired.  And don't argue with me!
penny lane, Have we met?
penny,Please.  I throw the little ones back.
polexia, Ian Hunter is a fucking asshole!
william,Polexia!
polexia,Opie!!!
ric,"It's all happening.   I just saw them on the seventh floor!  Mr. Jimmy Page... Mr. John Paul Jones...  Mr. Robert Plant signed my shirt in the elevator!!  Five minutes ago, he touched this pen.  Please don't smear it.  And Bonzo's gotta new motorcycle in the hotel!"
penny,Ric is a Zeppelin fan.
william,"Yeah, I picked that up."
penny,"He tours with them, but not ""with"" them."
ric,"They're on the 12th floor, but there's guards there!  So you gotta go to the tenth floor and go up the back steps."
penny lane,"This is my very dear, very close, very wonderful friend William Miller, he is very close with Lester Bangs."
ric,It's all happening!!  See you in Cleveland!
penny lane,I'm retired!  Doesn't anybody believe me!?
william,"Harry Houdini, please."
penny lane,Okay.  Time to put on the lampshade.
russell, Alright.
william, Alright.
penny lane," Oh, the hell with it."
polexia," Act One, in which she pretends she doesn't care about him."
william, We've got to stop them.
polexia,Stop them?  You were her excuse for coming here.
penny,I need ice!
polexia,"I just worry about people using her. You know?  'Cause she brings out the good side in everybody else, but what do they do for her?  Life kills me. Do you have any pot?"
william,Not on me.
polexia,Do you smoke?
william,No.  But I... I grow it.  I grow it.
polexia,"You're funny.  You know, if you were only taller, English, rich, a guitar- player and older..."
william,I'd be someone else.
polexia,Yeah.  Good point.
penny, How does it end?
russell,What?
penny,"You know - the story about the girl who dumps the guy who has an ex-ex wife -- the one we don't talk about -- and gets a hundred... okay, five letters from him, and then doesn't even leave a pass in San Diego.  Wake up!  I'm retired and I never believed you anyway. You're too talented and too good-looking to be trusted and everybody knows it."
russell, You're retired like Frank Sinatra is retired.
penny, Damn.
russell,Come to Arizona.
penny,Never.
russell,We leave Thursday morning.  9 AM.  And pack light this time.  Jesus.
william,This is he.
ben,"Crazy.  William, this is Ben Fong- Torres.  I'm the music editor at Rolling Stone Magazine.  We've got a copy of your stories from the San Diego Door. This is the same William Miller?"
william,Yes it is.
ben," Voice of God, howling dogs, the spirit of rock And roll... this is good solid stuff."
william, Thanks... thanks.
ben,You should be writing for us.  Any ideas?
william, How about Stillwater?
ben,Crazy.  New album... their third... starting to do something.
william, Sounds good.
ben,"We can only pay -- lemme see, three- thousand words -- seven hundred dollars."
william, Yes.
ben,What college --
elaine,"Honey, I need you to do that thing that fixes the garbage disposal --"
ben,"Well, I know how my lady gets when I don't Snap to it -"
william,Crazy.
ben,Crazy!  I'll let you go.  Call me at the San Francisco office tomorrow.
lester bangs,"Beware Rolling Stone Magazine.  They will change your story, they'll re- write it and turn it into swill. Beware!!"
william,"But besides that, what would be wrong with it?"
lester bangs, Look.  Do the story.  It's a good break for ya.  But remember this --
william, ... swill merchants...
lester bangs,Now.  What are you listening to?
william," I need to talk to Mrs. Deegan, from Journalism."
elaine,"Whatever it is, the answer is no."
elaine," Honey, what are you doing here?"
darryl,Moral support.
elaine,What's involved?
elaine,Is it time for me to say something?
elaine,No.
elaine,No.
elaine," ""Lo, that which I have feared has come upon me."""
william," ""He who jealously guards his fears, quietly yearns to bring them about!"""
elaine," No.  I have raised him to be an honor student, which he is.  We have agreed on all our goals.  We raised him to be a lawyer, we moved here to be near the finest law school in the West.  Plus, he has finals coming up, and in one week he graduates with all his friends -"
darryl,He's got no friends!!
william,Darryl.  Please.
william,"Lady of the Jury.  I wish to disprove the prevailing false belief that rock music is based on drugs and sex.  True, perhaps at one time... but rock music is different now.  It is now performed by hard-working intellectuals, with... with blazing intellectual pursuits, and I am going to play for you a piece of music designed to show you that my thesis is correct."
elaine,This is going to be hell.
william,The song is based on the literature of Tolkien...  and it's mystical attempt to elevate humanity has been successful throughout the world...  this song will change your life.
elaine,"What am I supposed to say?   You say it's Tolkien, fine.  They sound like nice kids.  Is it meant to elevate humanity?  ""Sure, let's elevate humanity.  After we sell you drugs and sex.""  All I have is my honesty.  That's what I believe, and that's what I know.  Oh.  Here's a nice ad."
dick,"C'mon, Doris!  Darling Bus.  You can make it!"
penny,Gotcha.
polexia,Do you have any pot?
william,No.  I'm a journalist.
polexia,"Well, go do your job then.  You're on the road, man.  It's all happening!  Get in there.  Go talk to 'em!"
william, Russell.   Do you think we might be able to find some time to talk when we get to Phoenix?  I want to interview everyone separately... and I felt we'd start with you and me.
russell,Absolutely.
william,Because I've got a thing in a couple days.
russell,What.
william, It's a... thing where... uhm... you go there to graduate.  School.
russell, I never graduated.  And look what happened.  You're here interviewing me.
larry,How did you know I was thirsty?
penny,I may need to stay in your room tonight. Russell's in a bad mood.  He's very Bob Dylan in Don't Look Back today. He's trying to write.
polexia, Want some?
william,No thanks.
elaine,Has William Miller arrived yet?  He hasn't.  Could you give him a message as soon as you see him? -
dick,"Jeff, Tony... Keys... keys... keys... room list...  If it doesn't have a number on it, it ain't ours!"
clerk,Is this Mr. Miller?  You have a message from Elaine.
william,Thanks.
clerk, She's a handful.
william,I know.
sapphire,"Finally, you're here!!  They kicked me out of my room!  Fuck Ozzy!"
russell,Come by in a few minutes.  We'll do the interview.
jeff,"I'm worried, man."
russell,"Naw, we can trust him.  He's a fan."
jeff,"But it's Rolling Stone.  He looks harmless, but he does represent the magazine that trashed Eric Clapton, broke up Cream, ripped Led Zeppelin, and wrote that lame story about the Allman Brothers Band that bummed Duane out before he died.  Don't forget the Rules.  This little shit is the Enemy. He writes what he sees.  But it would be cool to be on the cover."
russell,Leave it to me.  We'll get a good story.
jeff,Plus our girlfriends read this magazine and -  -- you know.
russell,You made your point.  I'll take to him.
penny,"Can Sapphire stay in your room tonight? She had a big fight with Ozzy, and Polexia's not working out with Jeff Bebe.  Jeff Bebe has so much jealousy over Russell that he can't express.  Plus, he never slept last night.   You keep Sapphire and I'll stay with Russell."
william,Sure.  I'll take her.
polexia,Me too?
william,Sure.
william,All these people.  And they all live in Phoenix.
polexia, Hi Dad!!  I can't talk long!  I'm here in Paris.  I'm staying in another Youth Hostel with no phone and no address for mail!!
william, Alex.  Lowbatz.
sapphire," I was the one who told him what to tattoo on his fingers, I was the one who made his shirts... I was there when his wife left him."
william,Charles.  C.  Swoop.
polexia, I CAN SEE THE EIFFELL TOWER.  DO YOU KNOW THERE ARE 578 STEPS TO THE TOP?
william,Paul and Debbie Finger.
estrella, Oh my God.  Simon Kirke of Bad Company is by the pool.
polexia,I GOTTA GO!  I'LL CALL FROM ROME!
estrella,Is anybody here as worried about Penny and Russell as I am?
polexia, AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MAGGIE!! I LOVE YOU!!
sapphire," Ooo, watch out - whoever you look at when you say that - that's who you really mean."
russell,You know.  We should talk about what we don't talk about.
penny,We don't have to.
russell,"No, I - I went to Catholic school.  I believe in guilt and... you know, if there's any to be had, I pretty much want to roll around in it."
penny,I don't believe in attachments.  No boundaries.  Just the music.
russell,"I'm just saying, it's okay to talk about it."
penny,Leslie.
russell, Alright - now we're talking.
penny,Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Lesssssslie. Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie. Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie. LESlie.  Leslie...
sapphire,"Opie, can I order room service?"
william,"Okay.  You guys.  Wait.   Put down the phone, Polexia.  First, this is my room..."
sapphire,"Come on, you're a fan like us.  You're on our side of the line."
william,Second.  I'm not Opie.  Alright?  Opie is a little boy.  I'm here to do a job.  I am a professional.
william,"Third!  ... this phone is a big, big deal.  In a minute, I have to go interview Russell.  Do not answer this phone if it rings.  I have family members with severe anxiety Problems.  She will not understand."
polexia, But what if Ozzy calls Sapphire?   And I gave Jimmy Page this number.
estrella,Or a guy who looked like Jimmy Page.
william,Okay.   I have a solution.  Answer the phone.  But if anyone without an English accent is on the phone...  Just hang up.  Or say it's the wrong room.
william,SHOULD I COME BY LATER?
william,MAYBE THAT'S A GOOD THING!!
william,OKAY!
russell,GO AWAY!
william,OKAY!
penny,Don't worry.  Some to the radio interview.
william,"No, I'm fine.  I'll just interview Jeff Bebe some more."
russell, GO AWAY!
quince allen,"The guitar of Russell Hammond.   ""Fever Dog""...  The band is Stillwater.  Watch with your mind as they materialize."
estrella,William's room.
ben,Can I please speak to him?  This is Ben Fong-Torres at Rolling Stone.
estrella,I think I just messed up!
quince,"Look at the dogs, wearing the funny hats.  Juggling just for you.  Freaks and family..."
jeff,"Well... not to get into a ""me"" thing... this is Jeff talking... but I did start the band, some time, actually, ago. This is back when we were the Jeff Bebe band, and I placed an ad in a magazine called Peaches looking for a guitarist and Russell Hammond answered."
quince, Peaches.
jeff,"I think he was a gift from God, actually.  Nobody plays like Russell Hammond."
russell," Well, shit.  Thank you."
jeff,Everybody pays you compliments.  It's not my fucking job to kiss your fucking ass all the time.
russell,Well then who's fucking job is it? Because my ass is dying for a kiss. And I know yours is too.
dick,It's my fucking job.  You're all geniuses.  And let me just add this thought - smegma.
tony,Feces.
quince,"The dong is called ""Love Thing."" Your mind is Starting to take effect. They're all here to see you swallow fire.  You scream soundlessly...  on the Night Circus.  It's Quince, with Stillwater."
russell," See, this is what nobody writes about! The in-between times!   This!  Us! Right now!!"
estrella, Hello?
elaine, May I speak with William please?
estrella, He's not here.  I think he's in the bar with the Band.  They just got back from the radio station.  Is this Maryann with the pot?
elaine,No this isn't Maryann with the pot. This is Elaine... his Mother.
estrella, I thought you were English.
elaine,Could you please give him a message? Could you tell him to call home immediately?  And could you also tell him -  I know what's going on.
estrella,"Alright.  Okay.  But I'm just going to say this, and I'm going to stand by it.  This is the maid speaking, by the way."
william," Now that you're starting to be successful, you had twenty-six years to write your first Album... and you'll have maybe four months for the second. Do you worry that the pressure of the business will get in the way of the original joy of making your music?  Or -"
russell,Whoa!  I need three more beers and my guitar before I can answer that question. Let's take a walk.
russell,"For a minute I thought you were actually a real journalist... which is... you know, it's great.  Shut that thing off, and I'll tell you the truth."
william,It's off.
russell,Look.  I trust you.  I'm going to lay this right on you.  Just make us look cool.
william,I will quote you warmly and accurately.
russell,That's what I'm worried about.  See - some of us have girlfriends back home. Some of us have wives.  And... some of the people you meet on the road are really amazing people...
william,Ohhhh.  Oh.  Yeah.
russell,You know what I mean?
william,Right.  Yeah.
russell,"See, you're dangerous.  Most people are just waiting to talk, but you listen."
william,Right.  Right.
russell,"So your question you asked me.  I think about It every fucking night.  The ""business.""  I hate it!  I grew up with these guys, okay?  I can't play all that I can play, I'm past these musicians, do you understand?"
william,I do.
russell,"The more popular we get, the more I can't walk on them, the bigger their houses get, the more pressure... you forget, man.  You forget what it was like to be real, to be a fan.  You can hear it in a lot of bands who've been successful - it doesn't sound like music anymore.  It sounds like... like lifestyle maintenance.  I used to be able to hear the sounds of the world.  Everything, to me, used to sound like music.  Everything.  Now I don't hear it.   You know what I'm trying to say?"
william, Yeah.
russell,"Man, it feels good to say this stuff out loud.  But what am I doing?  I'm telling secrets to the one guy you don't tell secrets to."
william," No, that's okay.  We'll do the interview tomorrow."
russell,"This is good.  So there's the ""friend"" and then there's the ""interview guy."""
william,Yeah.
russell,"So tonight it's ""friend"".... and when we wake up tomorrow - ""interview guy."" We'll figure it out as we go, buddy."
william,Hey - for whatever it's worth - you guys are really good.
william,How would you describe your role in Stillwater?  What is the chemical that you add to the chemistry?
larry,I'm the bass-player.
william, Right.  And when you take that away... what would be missing?  Stylistically? What chemical?
larry, The bass?
dick,"Good evening Phoenix.  From Troy, Michigan.  Please welcome, Stillwater."
dick,"Get in, get in!!"
promoter,Are you the manager of this band?
dick,"That, and more.  Get in!"
promoter,You didn't even play a full set!
dick,Your shoddy stage set-up almost killed our guitarist!
promoter,You trashed the dressing room - you didn't play your thirty-five minutes. You didn't fulfill your contract -
dick,Everybody in!  Get in the bus!
promoter,I'll report you to every promoter in the country!  I'm gonna talk to Frank Barcelona!
dick,YOU DON'T FUCK WITH MY BAND'S SAFETY!
promoter,I hope you have a good lawyer.
dick,I AM A LAWYER!
promoter,LOCK THE GATE ON 'EM!
penny,"Don't worry.  It's happened to all the greats.  Thank God you didn't hold the mike stand with both hands, you'd still be holding it.  This is a good thing. It's a good, good, good thing."
estrella,I forgot to tell you!  Your mom says to call home immediately.  She says she knows what's going on!  See you guys in Topeka!  I'll catch a ride with Sabbath!
dick, Wanna buy a gate?
william,What did it feel like to be electrocuted?
russell,"It burns.  It feels like a dose of lead shooting through your body... and then you see God, and he says, ""How bad do you want to be legendary?"" And god damnit.  I let go.  Rock and roll."
penny,Give that to me.
william,What will our names be?
penny,What do you think of Russell?
william,I like him.
penny,"You're coming to Cleveland, right?"
william,"Cleveland, Ohio?  Oh no no no.  I gotta get my interview with Russell before Greenville.  And you've got to help me.  Okay?  Friends... remember?"
penny,You should give him a break.  There are real problems in the band.   Off the record.
william,What problems?
penny,"Okay.  I got it.  I think your name should be Spencer, and mine will be Jane."
william,I can't keep up with you.
penny,No one can.
william,What's your real name?
penny,Here's the thing about Russell.  He's my last project.  I only do this for a very few people.  And I think we should do it together - he is almost great. We've got to take him there.  You and me - we can do it.  Deal?  Because the other guys are good - but he could be great.  He's my last project.
william,What do you love about music?
jeff,Hey.
william,Hey.
william,I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Mom.  Mom... Mom.
william,Right now -- Topeka.  Then Greenville. Then home.
elaine,"I guess I just miss you, and I don't understand why I've driven both my kids so far away from me.  By all practical rules don't I get you for three more years?"
william,I missed the last thing you said.
elaine,I LOVE YOU.
william,WHAT?
elaine, I MISS YOU AND I LOVE YOU!
william,I LOVE YOU!!
russell,"Fire away.  I'm ready.  I'm on the ""You"" Train.  Take me there."
william,"Do you have to be depressed to write a sad song?  Do you have to be in love to write a love song?  Is a song better if it really happened to you?  Like, ""If You Say Nothing""... where did you write that and how did it come about?"
russell,When did you get so professional?
penny,I'm almost done with my shirt.
dick,"Russell, your dad showed up again. And on a lighter note.  Gentlemen.  Your first t-shirts have arrived."
russell,Can we just skip the vibe and go straight to us laughing about this?
jeff, Yeah.  Okay.
russell, Because I can see by your face - you want to get into this -
jeff,How can you tell?  I'm just one of the out-of-focus guys.
russell,Here we go.
jeff,"Well, it speaks pretty loudly to me."
russell,It's a t-shirt.
jeff,I'm always gonna tell you the truth.
russell,Are you doing coke again?
jeff,Oh yeah.  All the time.
russell,"Excuse me, but didn't we all get into this to avoid responsibility?"
jeff,Forgive me.  But this is the slow-moving train of compromise that will kill us.
russell,"You can trust him,  you can say whatever you want."
jeff," And yet, why do I always end up feeling like I'm a joke to you?  I feel nothing but love for you.  We're a family."
russell,"Is it my turn?  Because I think we should, for once, say what we really mean."
jeff,"Oh, this is the part where you quit -"
russell, Right.  I'm so predictable.
jeff,No  I gotta tell the truth -- I want you to like me.  But sometimes I feel like you collect people who love you and then very skillfully... you make them feel bad that they're not good enough for you.
russell,"Stick to singing, brother, 'cause you ain't gonna make it as a shrink."
jeff,Deal with it!  And let me just say what nobody Else wants to say to you -
russell,What?
jeff,Your looks have become a problem.
dad,Son!
russell, Hello Harry.
dad,"He got all the good genes, huh?  Meet Deirdre.  We're getting married in July."
william,You okay?  You alright?
russell," From here on out, I'm only interested in what's real."
william,Thanks.
russell,"You know, you know all about us and I don't know shit about you.  What's your... your family like?  Tell me."
william,"Well, my dad died of a heart attack and my sister believes that my Mom is so intense that she might have contributed to it.  Plus -"
russell," Okay, that's good.  That's enough."
william,It's good to talk about it.  Really good.
russell,"If they want me, they can find me."
william,So listen.  I have to go home tomorrow. I know this is a bad time to finish our interview.
russell,"Hey, man, you know what?  Write whatever you want.  I trust you."
russell,"On my better days, yes.  I am ""Woooooo, Russell from Stillwater!"""
russell," You.  Aaron.  Are what it's all about. You are real.  Your room is real. Your friends are real.  You are more important than... than... all the silly machinery.  And you know it!  In eleven years it's gonna be 1984, man.  Think about that!"
aaron,Wanna see me feed a mouse to my snake?
russell,Yes.
russell,Take it!
aaron,Down the hall by the washing machine.
russell,What?
aaron,The bathroom.
russell,Okay.  Good to know.
william,We should probably head back sometime.
russell,Topeka.  Check it out.
william,Please don't give him any more acid.
russell,Faces.  Stones.  Sa-weet Baby James!! None of these people are gonna be around in twenty years!  Plastic begets plastic!!   Black plastic.
william,No no.  Nope.  No.
russell, I AM A GOLDEN GOD!!
william,Hey Russell -
russell,I AM A GOLDEN GOD!!
william,"Don't jump, okay?"
russell,And you can tell Rolling Stone Magazine my last words were -
william,I think we should work on those last words.
russell,Critic!!
william,"No, I'm not -"
russell,Okay I got it.  I got it.  I got it. I got it.   This is better.  Last words -  I DIG MUSIC!!
william,Just come on down!!
russell, Okay.
russell,Thanks for saving my life.  I won't hold it against you.
dick, They've been crying for you like a bunch of whimpering pussies --
russell, The band is over.  This is my family now.
others,Right on.  He's staying with us.
dick," Definitely.  It's all over.  We'll just ride on to Greenville, listen to some great music, finish the tour, and leave those ungrateful fools behind. And then we'll come back here, where you'll live."
russell,I know what you're doing... and I like it.  How do we know he's not a cop?
dick, Easy.  He's your Guardian Angel.
william,Which half?
dick,Good question.
william, I have to go home.
dick,Hey.  You saved the tour.   That's good enough for now.
quiet girl,I'll never forget you.
lester,How's it going?
william,Rolling Stone is calling me.  I don't have my key interview.  I don't know what to say.
lester bangs," You're flipping out.  That's good. Alright.  This is how you blow their minds.  He'll ask you - this is Ben Fong-Torres, right? - he'll ask you how the story's going.  Here's what you do - let's fry his mind.  Tell him ""it's a think piece about a mid-level band struggling with their own limitations in the harsh face of stardom.""  Ha ha!!  This is fun!"
william, ... think... piece...
sapphire,It says the food is hearty and adventurous.
polexia, Greenville.  I'm bored.
sapphire,Who his the quaaludes from me?
william,Wait.  I'll leave.
penny,Backwards?
william," I don't know.  I just thought we could hang out, maybe do some stuff back home, regular stuff, get to know each other better... and then I'd see you pee.  I mean, that's the way I usually do it."
penny,You're one of us.  It's no big deal.
william,I'm not one of you.
penny,"Oh!  If you go to Cleveland, Bowie's going to be there at Swingo's, the greatest hotel in America.  I'll introduce you to him, and his security guy Dennis."
william,Don't you have any regular friends?
penny,Famous people are just more interesting.
william," Well, I would be worried that they were using me.  And not that anybody's using you, but -"
penny,"Boy, if this was the real world and some guy talked to me like that -"
william,"Let me finish.  I'm not famous.... but you could always use me.   If anything happens.  And I would never use you.  Even if I got famous.  So you know, you always have that from me... in the real world.  If you ever have to go back there, for anything."
sapphire,Your time has come.
william,Did he call?  What are you -- stop it -- we're talking here.
sapphire,Pants him.  Opie must die.
sapphire,Just relax.  Take a vacation from yourself.  Leave this to professionals.
sapphire," Hello.  Hi, Ben-Fong-Torres from Rolling Stone."
william, Hello.
ben,"Hello William, this is your editor at --"
william,I'm getting good stuff out here.
ben,Sounds like it.
polexia,"Man, I need some -"
ben," Now listen.  Get it together.  We're both professionals, I don't have to tell you this.  You're not out there to join the party -- we already have one Hunter Thompson.  You're out there to interview and Report.  You got me? This isn't Creem Magazine, it's Rolling Stone.  We need this story in four days.  Now I want to know how it's shaping up."
william,It's a think-piece about a mid-level band grappling with their limitations in the face of the harsh glare of success.
ben," I like what we're saying.  Let me try and get you a thousand more words. It's in consideration for the cover, but don't tell the band."
william, Crazy.
polexia,- coffee.
sapphire,Me too.  Greenville is so boring.  Any other city in the world and you'd still be a virgin.
william,I'm going out to find Russell.
sapphire,Will you take the laundry?
william, What am I to you?  Tell me right now! What. Am.  I.  To.  You.
william,Houdini... Houdini...
william,No.  I can't.  You've got to help me. I have to go home.
russell,"Come on man, we'll have more time there. Don't be tense!!"
william, You said you'd help me.
penny, Come to Cleveland.
russell, Come to Cleveland... Come to Cleveland...
william,I can't!!
russell,Can we help it if we like having you around!
penny,Rock and roll!
william, Rock and roll.
russell,I feel... like his parents.
penny,I know.
russell,I wonder how that happened.
penny,"You ever notice that all our sentences begin with ""I?"""
russell,"I hadn't, no."
penny,'Cause we should work on that.
russell,Cleveland!
fan,It's Bowie!
william,Hi Mom.  I'm in Cleveland.
russell,Tell her you're a slave to the groove - you can't help it!
william, No.
russell,"Hi Mom!  It's Russell Hammond, I play guitar in Stillwater!   It's my fault. How does it feel to be the mother of the future of rock journalism?  Hello?"
elaine,Listen to me.   Your charm does not work on me.  I'm onto you.  Of course you like him.
russell,Yes.
elaine,"He worships you people and that's fine with you, as long as he helps make you rich."
russell, Rich?  I don't think so -
elaine,"Listen to me.  He's a smart, good- hearted, 15 year-old kid, with infinite potential."
russell,"Yes, ma'am."
elaine,"If you break his spirit, harm him in any way, keep him from his chosen profession -- which is law, Something you may not value but I do -- you will meet the voice on the other end of this telephone.  And it will not be pretty.    Do we understand each other?"
russell,Yes... yes...
elaine," I didn't ask for this role, but I'll play it.  Now go do your best.  ""Be bold and mighty forces will come to your aide!""  Goethe said that.  It's not too late for you to be a person of substance.  Get my son home safely, I'm glad we spoke."
william,Some people get her.  Some don't.
russell,Your Mom kind of freaked me out.
william,She means well.
dick," From Troy, Michigan..."
william,So when you play a great show like tonight...
dick,Okay.  I need everybody's attention.
russell, Then bring him in.
jeff, Bring him in!  We'll send him out on a rail!
russell, We'll finish on the way to Boston. You can fly home from Boston.
dennis hope, Hi.
russell,We already have a manager.  He's been with us from the beginning.
dennis hope,"Respectfully.  We all have our roots. I believe in bands holding onto their roots.  But those roots need to be augmented.  I'm gonna tell you the truth - I may enrage some and enthrall others. I don't really give a fuck.   Your manager here needs a manager.  Example. If you hadn't run out on the contract in Phoenix, you could have sued over Russell's hand... but you left, negating the contract, forfeiting the deposit, and you effectively traveled a long way to pay that promoter... to electrocute you."
russell, We travel by bus.
jeff,Doris is the soul of this band!  That bus has been our home since we were the Jeff Bebe Band.
dennis,Hey man -- it's travel on a pogo stick if I thought we'd make more money. You can play more dates with a plane...
russell," Hey man, it's not about the money!  It's about Playing music, and turning people on!"
dennis hope," Yes, of course.  Clearly. Respectfully.   But on the distasteful subject of money.  Just know.  You're making it -- right now -- and it's all --"
dick,But why should we pay you for something we can do ourselves?
dennis hope," Do you know how you get a record not pressed but played?  Do you know?  I didn't invent the rainy day, man.  I just own the best umbrella."
dick," Yeah, well... we'll think about what you said."
dennis hope," No no.  You don't understand.  I'll think about it.  I'm not auditioning. I came here to decide whether I want to represent you.  So I'll stand outside for a moment, and think about whether I want to stay."
russell,This is not us.   This is too much.
dennis hope,Do you mind?
william,Anyone seen Russell?
dick,The Enemy!
russell,Hey!  Welcome to the Road Crew Poker Party.  This game's been going of for two years.
dick,That's Mick - he's with The Who.  That's John - with J. Geils.  And that's Richard with the Eagles... and you know The Wheel.
the wheel,Hey.
dick,"Side proposition.  For fifty dollars and a case of Heineken, I will put into the pot... three Lovely Ladies, Including the famous Penny Lane... the Band-Aids, who need to exit our tour before New York..."
reg,It's a deal.  Show 'em.
dick,Three Lovely Ladies... now in the custody of Humble Pie.
reg,"Alright, so we owe you fifty dollars and a case of Heineken."
russell,Look.  Nobody's feelings are getting hurt here.  She already knows Leslie's coming To New York tomorrow.  They all understand.  This is the Circus. Everybody's trying not to go home. Nobody's saying goodbye.
william,"No, I got it."
russell,"These are the Rules that come with every electric Guitar and every amplifier.  They're not just written anywhere.  Rock and roll, brother.  No attachments.  No boundaries."
sabbath roadie,Keep this hallway clear!
dick,Happy Birthday from us.
russell,"So Penny our friend has gained another year. But long ago, she threw it in gear. She rocked the south The East and West. Could you please get off this endless tour Where we're Black Sabbath's fucking special guest?"
dennis hope, Sorry the plane isn't bigger.
penny,"So it wasn't a birthday party, it was a farewell."
william,What's that?
penny, You're worried about me and Russell.
william,Yeah.  I gotta work on that.
penny,You're so sweet.  God -- if there was more of you in him...
william,Don't tell me this stuff.  I want to like him.
penny, Did you miss your test or something?
william, Penny -
penny," Forget it.  I'm flying to New York myself.  I have a bunch of partial tickets.  I know his ex-wife, current girlfriend's going to be there -"
william,-- I'm not sure that's a good idea.
penny, What?  What are you saying?  What do you know?  Did Russell say something?
william,I don't know anything.
penny,I know he wants me there.  He gave me a cake.  He wrote me that sweet poem.
william, Wake up!  Don't go to New York!
penny,What are you telling me?
william,Because you're not who you said you were!  I thought you were retired!
penny,"You're right.  I'm not who I said I was.  I'm just like you. I love music, so this is my family.  Some people like tractors, and they hang out with tractor people.  What's the worst that could happen if I go to New York?  ""I get my little heart broken?"""
william,Oh no.  Never you!  You eat people alive!
penny, I'm sorry I told you so much.   You have some way of making everybody tell you all their secrets.
william,That's a good one.  Tell me too much and make it my fault.
penny,"Come on.  You've seen what's happened. Russell and I fell in love.  How much, I don't know... but this is the first time I've fallen for someone, really fallen... since Iggy, and I'm not happy about it."
william, You slept with Iggy Pop!?
penny, You'll remember me forever.  I was there when you lost your virginity.
william, So was Steely Dan!  It was a crowded room.
penny,You make me laugh.  I think I'm gonna cry.
william, I thought we were going to Morocco! There's no Morocco.  There's never been a Morocco.  There's not even a Penny Lane.  I don'teven know your real name.
penny,"If I ever met a guy in the real world, who looked at me the way you just looked at me..."
william,When and where does the real world occur?  I am really... confused here. Fuck!  All these Rules And all these sayings... and nicknames...
penny,You know -- you're too sweet for rock and roll.
william,"Where do you get off... where do you get ""sweet?""  I'm not sweet.  I'm dark and mysterious and pissed-off and I could be very dangerous to all of you... I'm not sweet, and you should know that about me!  I am The Enemy."
penny,You're not any of those things and that's what I love about you.
william,You fall in love to keep from falling in love.
penny,I don't want to go home!
william,"Well, I have to go home.  And you never helped me."
penny,Yes I did.
william,That disc-jockey in Arizona got a better interview than me... and he was asleep.
penny,Look.  You should be happy for me. You don't know what he says to me in private.  Maybe it is love.  As much as it can be with someone who --
william, -- sold you to Humble Pie for fifty dollars and a case of beer?  I was there!
penny,What kind of beer?
polexia,Who did this to us?
elaine,"Then don't come home.  Don't do this to me.  If you're going to miss graduation, don't come home."
elaine,I'm sorry.  I can't concentrate.  Rock stars kidnaped my son.
russell,"""New York.  Just like I pictured it... """
jeff,""" ... skyscrapers and everything."""
russell, We showed you America.  We did everything but get you laid.
fan,I'm from the Church of Lenny.   We bow to his will and all that it represents - The King of the King of Kings.
russell,Make it out to - ?
fan,To Lenny.
dick,She's here.
jeff,Leslie!
dick,"Your room is completely stocked, far away from any noisy ice machines, elevators or maid quarters.  The air- conditioning is already on.  And here is your security key -- by the way, you look stunning."
leslie, ThanksI'llseeyoulater.
dick,Bags in five!  Cars leave for the party at six!
william, Well -- I kept thinking I was going home the next day --
dick,I did too.  Fifteen years ago.
william,Ric!
ric, They're all staying under the name Emily Rugburn.
russell," After the party.  I'll come to your room - I promise.  We'll talk.  This is Leslie, by the way.  Leslie, this is our wayward friend from Rolling Stone.  The Enemy."
clerk,"William Miller?  Sir, you have an urgent call from a Mr. ""Ben Fong-Torres."" He's holding for you, right now."
william, Hello.
ben,Congratulations.  It's gonna be a cover. Neal Preston will shoot 'em next week in L.A.  we need you back in San Francisco tomorrow.  We'll finish the story here.
william,Mojo?
ben,A mojo.  It's a very modern machine that transmits pages over the telephone. It only takes eighteen Minutes a page...
dennis hope,"He's okay, he's with us -"
russell,"Ah ha!  There you are, ya little fucker. Come on --"
william,I have some good news.
russell,-- I'll piss to that.  Follow me.
russell,"Dennis Hope took me aside, and wants to manage Me solo.  Says to lose the band by February.  Should I do it?  I have no perspective anymore."
william,I do.
russell," Oh - get this - somebody told Penny Lane I sold her for beer.  The network of these chicks!  Like I would do that. It's Jeff who told her, right?  Not you, right?  None of these guys can just calm down and be a fuckin adult. Now she's here, freaking out.  Leslie can smell it."
william, Wait.  I've got something to tell -
william,You guys -- you guys --  You're gonna be on the cover of Rolling Stone.
jeff," The cover of Rolling Stone.  And we made it together.  They don't just put somebody with one little hit on the cover of Rolling Stone Fucking Magazine, man.  We made it."
leslie,"Who is that girl?  She's creeping me out.  She's not with any of you, is she?"
william,"Emily Rugburn, please."
william,Hi.  I'm a friend of Penny Lane's.
william,Where is she?
english musician,She's sick.  Let's get out of here.
william,What happened?
penny lane,I'm not good at goodbyes.
william,"Oh -- wonderful.  Front desk?  Please send a doctor. Room... what room?  703.  702.   Both rooms, either room.  This is Mr. Rugburn, Yes.  My wife's had an accident with some quaaludes.  Yes - I'll do that."
principal,And now... out graduating class!  Jane Abbott!
principal,Victor Sanchez!
william,"""In the unlikely event of a water landing... """
penny,"""... you will be required to wear a safety vest."""
william,Keep going.
penny,"""Please place all stowable luggage in the overhead compartments... out in the seat in front of you."""
william," ""Seat and tray tables."""
penny,"""And seat-backs and tray-tables should be in their full and upright and locked positions... """
principal,"And now... out ""Pending"" Graduates!  William Miller... not present."
william,"""In the tragic event of a water landing..."""
principal,"And to the class of 1973, we say --  They key to the future is keeping today alive forever."
elaine,"Please let there be only two, because I can't get past Number One."
elaine,He's got twelve of them.  They're lined up.  He's just tired of me.
penny,"""... you will be required to...""  I'm tired."
william,"Well.  Now that I have your attention. And you may not remember this later, I just want to make it clear that... Hey!  I love you, and I'm about to boldly go where...  Many men have gone before..."
doctor,Your wife will be okay for now -
william,Thank you Doctor.
doctor,"However, she says you're her brother."
william, She's a little confused.
doctor,Nice champagne.
william,I don't have a driver's license.  With me.
doctor,"Tomorrow's my wedding anniversary. I'd prefer to take care of this without facing the dawn at the police station. So if you can find a way to get this girl - your wife - back home to her parents, I'd let you pay me anything you can afford.  Because you don't appear to be related to the famous Rugburns of Rhode Island."
william,Happy Anniversary.
doctor,"She won't be good company, but keep her awake for another four hours."
penny," When I was 14, my Mom and her boyfriend took me to a Rolling Stones concert - and I freaked out and I rushed up to the front of the stage and then a thousand people had the same idea at the same time and I was getting crushed. And I couldn't breathe and that thought flashed through me - almost like a car accident - I thought I might die.  And it was in the middle of ""Midnight Rambler"" and Keith Richards saw me. And he came over, and came to the front of the stage, and he pulled me out. And they took me backstage and they gave me coke with ice and a - and a lemon.  And I never went home."
william,What about your Mom?
penny,"She always said - ""Marry Up."" Marry someone grand.  That's why she named me Lady."
william, She named you Lady?
penny,Lady Goodman.
william,No.
penny,"You never really get used to it, either."
william,Well -- this -- this just explains everything.
penny,See you back there.
william,Hey Lady!
stewardess,"Please extinguish all flammable items, and return all seats and tray tables to their full and upright locked positions."
russell,"Why didn't you come back to the party? Bob Dylan showed up.  He was sitting at our table for... had to be an hour, right?  Just  Rapping.  Bob Dylan!  I kept looking for you.  I was going to introduce you."
jeff,What happened to you last night?
william,It's a log story.
russell," ""Peggy Sure... Peggy Sue... """
dick,Please.
russell,"""Pretty pretty pretty pretty Peggy Sue... """
jeff,We shouldn't be here.
russell,"Doris, we miss you!"
pilot's voice,"This is Craig, your pilot.  It appears we've caught the edge of that electrical storm we were trying to outrun.  Buckle up tight now.  We're gonna do our best to getcha out of this."
jeff,"""Electrical storm?"""
russell, Rock and roll.
dennis hope,A field?
jeff,I can't breathe.
dick,And everyone thinks it's so glamorous out here.
larry, He just told us we're gonna die.
jeff, We're gonna crash in Elvis' hometown --
russell,Shut up.
jeff,-- we can't even die in an original city!
russell,"C'mon Dennis, get us a better city."
leslie,Oh my God.
russell,If something should happen.  I love all of you.  I don't think we have to do the secrets thing.
dennis hope,"I once hit a man in Dearborn, Michigan. A hit-and-run.  I hit him and kept on going.  I don't know if he's alive or dead, but I'm sorry."
leslie, Oh my God.
dick,"I love you all too, and you're my family.  Especially since Marna left me.  But if I ever took an extra dollar or two, here and there, it was because I knew I'd earned it."
russell,"I slept with Marna, Dick."
jeff,I did too.
larry,I waited until you broke up with her. But me too.
jeff,"I also slept with Leslie, when you were fighting."
russell,You... slept with Jeff?
leslie,"Yes, but it didn't count.  It was the summer we decided to be free of all rules."
russell," And you say you ""love me."""
jeff," I don't love you, man.  I never did."
russell,Please.  Enough.
jeff,NONE of us love you.  You act above us.  You ALWAYS HAVE!!
larry,Finally.  The truth.
jeff,"You just held it over us, like you light leave... like we're lucky to be with you. And we had to live with it. I had to live with you, and now I might die with you and it's not fucking fair."
russell, You hate me?  You too?
jeff,And I'm still in love with you Leslie.
leslie,I don't want to hear anymore.    Shut up! Shut up!  Shut up!
russell," Whatever happens, you're dead."
jeff,"Don't be self-righteous, Russell, not now.  You were sleeping with Penny, that groupie.  Last summer, and up until yesterday.  Why don't you tell Leslie THAT?"
dennis, I quit.
william,"""That groupie?""  She was a Band-Aid. All she did was love your band.  And you all -- you used her, all of you. You used her and threw her away.  She almost died last night, while you were with Bob Dylan.  You're always talking about the fans, the fans, the fans. She was your biggest fan and you threw her away.  And if you can't see that, that's your biggest problem."
ed,I'm gay.
jeff,"Well, I think we can build on this new honesty."
receptionist,Leave your package at the desk.
william,I'm not a messenger.  I'm one of your writers.  William Miller.
ben,You're William Miller?
william,Yep.
ben, Oh baby.
jann,We can't run this piece.
ben,You obviously saw more than you wrote about.  After eight days on the road with these guys.
david felton,Didn't anything happen?
jann,And where are you in this piece?  What did you want to write?  Because this reads like what they wanted you to write.
ben,What happened to your highly-touted think piece on limitations of a middle- level Band in the face of success?
jann,We can push up Chet's Who cover -
fact checker,"Good 'cause it's going to take me three days to get through this research. It's all handwritten, on little slips. Plus, they all refer to woman as ""chicks."" I mean, as a woman I have a problem with that.  I know it's a side issue."
david felton, Happened with me and Charlie Manson. He was a very charming... lively... charismatic...
william,Please let me finish it.  Give me tonight to work on it.
fact checker,Chet's piece is all fact-checked and ready.
jann, Get some sleep.  We'll do another story sometime.  We'll get you a kill fee.
fact checker,His research is all on little bits of paper.  Did I say that?
william,Ben.  You told me to send what I had. It's not finished.
fact checker,That's being charitable.
jann,Let him use the big office.   It's where Hunter used to write.
fact checker, You can type.
william,Yes.  It took it in grade school.
lester bangs,"Aw, man.  You made friends with them! See, friendship is the booze they feed you.  They want you to get drunk on feeling like you belong."
william," Well, it was fun."
lester bangs,"They make you feel cool.  And hey.  I met you.  You are not ""cool."""
william,"I know.  Even when I though I was, I knew I wasn't."
lester bangs,"That's because we are uncool!  And while women will always be a problem for guys like us, most of the great   art in the world is about that very problem. Good-looking people have no spine! Their art never lasts!  They  get the girls, but we're smarter."
william,I can really see that now.
lester bangs,"Yeah, great art is about conflict and pain and guilt and longing and love disguised as sex, and sex disguised as love... and let's face it, you got a big head start."
william,I'm glad you were home.
lester bangs,I'm always home!  I'm uncool!
william,Me too!
lester bangs, The only true currency in this bankrupt world if what we share with someone else when we're uncool.
william, I feel better
lester,My advice to you.  I know you think those guys are your friends.  You want to be a true friend to them?
lester bangs,Be honest and unmerciful.  You're doing great.  Call me later is you want.  I'm always up.
felton,Read me the opening line.
ben," ""I am flying high over Tupelo, Mississippi, with America's hottest band, and we are all about to die."""
felton,Mmmmm.  Dark.  Lively.
ben,"Yeah, and it gets better.  Did this all really happen?"
fact checker, Give it to me.  I'll call and check the quotes.
jeff,Look.  Let's just piece together our information...  because the fact-checker asked us all about different parts of the story.
tony,What did he write about?  What's he using?
jeff,It.  All.  He's using it all.
russell,So what?
jeff,"So what?  We come off like amateurs... some average band...  trying to come to grips, jealous and fighting and breaking up - we're buffoons!"
russell,Maybe we just don't see ourselves the way we really are.
jeff,He was supposed to be our friend.
russell, I told him to write what he wanted.
tony," By the way, he has you on acid, screaming ""I Am A Golden God"" from a fan's rooftop."
russell, Oh my God.
jeff,They used him to fuck us.
russell," I didn't say ""Golden God.""  Or did I?"
dick,"We never took him seriously, and now it's serious."
russell,I liked him as a person.
jeff,"He was never a ""person!""  He was a journalist!"
russell,You.  You had the right idea all along.
dennis hope, How about the plane flight?
dick,"It's all in there.  But don't worry, it's all unspecific who say what.  No names are mentioned in the more embarrassing sequences, it's just completely obvious who's who!  We're fucked!"
russell,I forgot he was there.
dennis hope,"Well, they haven't talked to Russell - he can always deny the key stuff to the fact checker.  Then they can't print it."
jeff, Is that true?
dennis hope,"It's war, my friend.  If you'd met me earlier, he would have never been on the around."
fact checker,The band just denied 90% of the story. It's a fabrication.
william,Did you talk to Russell?
fact checker,Russell Hammond is the one who denied it.
ben, Crazy.
fact checker, We're going with the Who - !
someone's voice,He's just some fan... what did you expect?
felton,"Well, I believe you."
william,Goodbye.
felton,Powerful  word.  Strong.  Final.
russell,I feel bad.
sapphire,"Well, at least you feel.  That puts you in a higher class of asshole."
russell,What did I do?
sapphire,Well - you can do what the big boys do.  Nothing.
russell,Yeah.
sapphire,"You believe these new girls?  None of 'em take birth control, and they eat all the steak."
russell,Is Penny okay?
sapphire,"The Quaalude Incident.  Yeah, it wasn't pretty.  She could have died.  I always warned her about letting too many guys fall in love with her.  I guess I was wrong.  On of 'em saved her life."
russell,"Well, it's finally over with Leslie. I'm going to call her."
sapphire,Let her retire.  ... pretty average people.  She deserves it...
dick,"Have a good vacation.  I hope the band stays together.  Before it all went down the shitter, it was starting to get really good."
russell,I'm not going to blame myself.  I do make people happy.  They just shouldn't get to know me... 'cause it appears to spoil everything.
sapphire,Don't be so easy on yourself.
russell,What gives you the right to get this personal with me.
sapphire,Let's not reminisce.
anita,William?
anita,"You guys, I'll deadhead back later.  I think I'm needed."
female attendant,You have a good day!
anita,"You look awful, but that's great. You're living your life!  You're finally free of... her."
william,Yeah.
anita,"Hey.  I'll take off work.  Let's have an adventure together.  You and me, finally.  Anywhere you want to go. Anywhere in the world."
anita,This is not my idea of a good time.
william,Just get me to my bed.
anita, I'll deal with her.
anita, What are we going to do about him?
elaine,"I don't know.  Whatever happened to him, I just wish it could have happened to me."
anita,The magazine killed his story.
russell,"Hi, I'm Russel Hammond."
secretary,You're here regarding?
russell,My life.
russell,"I don't care what happens.  I don't care if you put us on the cover.  But you sent us a kid and... and he was a fan.   And we all made friends with him - absolutely, to get a good story. But then we actually liked him.  We thought he's... show us our lives in some mythic way and I guess... we're not mythic.  We panicked."
jann,You denied most of the story.
russell,"Yeah, well, here's the problem with the truth.  It's too true -"
ben,"Well, we appreciate the visit.  The last time an artist came here, it was Buddy Miles and he punched me."
russell,"I'm not punching anybody.  I am personally, as of 2 pm yesterday, on a voyage of self-reinvention.  This is about William Miller.  He lives with us, he lost his virginity, he saw us at our worst, appreciated our best, he saved two lives, including mine... he smuggled about a half-pound of pot into Boston, and we never even told him -"
jann,It's too late.  We're going with a different cover.
russell, Thank God.
ben,Next time we'll all be more professional.
russell,"Maybe so.  You might have died at the right time, my friend."
jann,Thank you for visiting.  Good luck.
russell,"Do what you want, but the story is true."
anita,They're called pancakes.  Who knows when we'll be together again.  Splurge. It's what most people call breakfast.
elaine,I went through your records.  And I found a song to play for you.
