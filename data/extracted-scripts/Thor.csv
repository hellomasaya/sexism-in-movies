Speaker,Dialogue
jane,"Hurry! We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below. Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG  who emerges as well, rubbing his head."
selvig,"Thanks. So what's this ""anomaly"" of yours supposed to look like?"
jane,"It's a little different each time. Once it looked like, I don't know, melted stars, pooling in a corner of the sky. But last week it was a rolling rainbow ribbon--"
jane,"Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and my gloves, will you? Intern DARCY LEWIS  hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin."
selvig, I recognize those. Think how proud he'd be to see you now. Jane's grin fades to a sad smile.
jane,Thank you.
selvig,For what?
jane,The benefit of the doubt. The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried.
jane," Sure, if you like rocking out to KFRM, ""All agriculture, all the time."" Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle."
jane,"The anomalies are always precipitated by geomagnetic storms. She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book, tracking occurrences and patterns."
darcy,"Jane? Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of champagne begins to vibrate."
jane,There's got to be some new variable... Or an equipment malfunction... The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static.
darcy,I don't think there's anything wrong with your equipment... The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it shakes more violently. Jane and Selvig notice.
jane,What?!
darcy,I think you want to see this. Darcy points out the window. Jane and Selvig look out. Over the desert --
jane,Holy. Shatner.
selvig,"That's your ""subtle"" aurora?!"
jane,No-- yes! Let's go!
jane,Isn't this great?! A thought strikes her.
selvig,That's debateable. Put your seat belt on!
jane,You've gotta get us closer so I can take a magnetic reading. Darcy laughs.
darcy,"Yeah, right! Good one!  Oh God, you're serious..."
jane,You want those college credits or not?
darcy,Keep the credits. I'll intern at Burger King.
jane,What are you doing?!
darcy,"Saving our lives! Jane grabs the wheel, jerks it hard the other way. They struggle for control, when the headlights fall on --"
darcy,I think that was legally your fault.
jane,"Get the first aid kit. Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels next to the man. Selvig hovers, protectively. She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him clearly for the first time. He is magnificently handsome, long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted features. She cups her hands around his face, as if willing the life back into him."
darcy,Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I know CPR. A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels. She looks up at Selvig. Back to being a scientist.
jane,--are dilating. That's a good sign.
selvig,We still have to get him to a hospital.
selvig,"Immediately, Jane. Jane sighs and nods, regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE above their heads. A thought strikes her."
jane,"Where did he come from? They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last glowing remnants of the storm, and into:"
odin allfather,"Stares out at his kingdom. The ravens fly up to the balcony, land at his side."
odin,Do you think he's ready?
frigga,He thinks he is. He has his father's confidence.
odin,He'll need his father's wisdom.
frigga,And his humility? Odin reacts.
odin,"Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He could be a great King... Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating, trying to stop the strange event through the force of his sheer will."
frigga,"For once, our son needs something we cannot provide."
odin,I can fight it a little longer...
frigga,No. You've put it off too long! I worry for you. He touches her cheek.
odin,"I've destroyed demons and monsters, devastated whole worlds, laid waste to mighty kingdoms, and still you worry for me?"
frigga,Always.
odin,"Not today. Now come kiss your king... while I'm still king. He pulls her close, and they kiss."
thor,Another!
thor,Have you ever known me to be nervous?
loki,There was the time in Nornheim...
thor,"That wasn't nerves, brother. It was the rage of battle. How else could I have fought my way through a hundred warriors and pulled us out alive? The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for Thor."
loki,"As I recall, I was the one who veiled us in smoke to ease our escape."
thor,"Some do battle, others just do tricks. The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand. EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles."
loki,"Just a bit of fun.  Right, my friend? The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGED"
thor,"You don't really want to start this again, do you, Cow?"
loki,I was being sincere!
thor,You're incapable of sincerity.
loki,"Am I? He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost."
thor,"Thank you. The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:"
loki,Give us a kiss.
thor,Stop. Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.
loki,Like a king. They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.
thor,You go ahead. Loki casts him a wary look.
fandral,"Thank you, love. "
sif, I'll miss you.
volstagg,I hope this goes quickly. I'm famished.
volstagg,"Are you attached to that pretty face of yours? Because one more word, and you won't be."
fandral," My, we are hungry, aren't we? The others laugh, save Hogun. Fandral turns to him."
sif,"Fandral, is it true the famous Warriors Three are ready to meet any challenge?"
fandral,"Name it, Lady Sif."
sif,Keep your mouth shut.
frigga,It's all right to be nervous.
thor,Why does everyone keep saying that? I'm not nervous!
frigga,You may be able to fool the rest of
thor,...but never you. I know.
frigga,"Thor, just remember that you have something even the great Allfather never had."
thor,And what is that?
frigga,Me for a mother. She smiles.
volstagg, Where is he?
loki,"He said he'd be along. Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval."
volstagg,What?
sif,He wants to make an entrance.
fandral,"Well, if he doesn't show up soon, he shouldn't bother. Odin looks like he's ready to feed him to his ravens."
loki,I wouldn't worry. Father will forgive him. He always does.
mjolnir,"Roars up into the hall, Thor strides cockily into the hall behind it, catching it behind his back. The CROWD erupts in CHEERS. Thor spins his hammer with a flourish, holds it up before the crowd, basking in the moment, relishing the adoration, whipping his audience up into a frenzy."
sif,"Oh, please. Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display."
odin,"Gungnir. Its aim is true, its power strong. With it I have defended Asgard and the lives of the innocent across the Nine Realms since the time of the Great Beginning. And though the day has come for a new King to wield his own weapon -- that duty remains the same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my first-born."
odin,"Today I entrust you with the greatest honor in all the Nine Realms. The sacred throne of Asgard. I have sacrificed much to achieve peace. So, too, must a new generation sacrifice to maintain that peace. Responsibility, duty, honor. These are not merely virtues to which we must aspire. They are essential to every soldier and to every King. The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the hall. Thor turns back to face his father. Odin looks upon his son with pride."
thor,I swear.
odin,Do you swear to preserve the peace?
thor,I swear.
odin,Do you swear to cast aside all selfish ambition and pledge yourself only to the good of all the Realms? Beat.
thor,I swear.
odin,"Then on this day, I, Odin Allfather, proclaim you-- Odin hesitates, noticing a strange sight before him. ICE creeps across the surface of the large banners around the hall, making an eerie CRACKING sound. Thor, his comrades, and the crowd see it too."
sif,The Destroyer.
fandral,I've never been inside the Vault before. It's said the Tesseract was once held here.
sif,Shush! Odin surveys the destruction.
thor,The Jotuns must pay for what they've done!
odin,"They have paid with their lives. The Destroyer did its job, and the Casket is safe. All is well."
thor,"""All is well?!"" They broke into the Weapons Vault! If the Frost Giants had stolen even one of these"
odin,But they didn't.
thor,I want to know why they--
thor,And if you hadn't taken it from them they would have laid waste to all the Nine Realms!
odin,"I have a truce with Laufey, the Jotun King."
thor,He just broke your truce! We must act! Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three.
odin,"Leave us. Thor's comrades exit. Odin eyes Thor, as Loki watches."
thor,"March into Jotunheim as you once did, teach them a lesson, break their spirits so they'll never dare try to cross our borders again!"
odin,You're thinking only as a warrior!
thor,This was an act of war!
odin,"It was the act of but a few, doomed to fail."
thor,They got this far!
odin,"We will find the breach in our defenses. It will be found, and it will be sealed."
thor,"As King of Asgard, I would--"
odin,"You are not King. Not yet. Thor sees in his father's face that he's pushed this as far as he can. He backs away, then leaves, pushing through the doors so hard that they SLAM backwards behind him. Odin watches him go."
sif,"Redecorating, are we? Volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food, aghast."
volstagg,What's this -- ?!
hogun,I told you they'd cancel it.
fandral,"We thought that was just you being your normal cheery self. Volstagg looks about the floor, despairing."
volstagg,"All this food -- so innocent, cast to the ground. It breaks the heart! Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall. Loki calmly moves towards him."
thor,"It's unwise to be in my company right now, brother."
loki,Who said I was wise?
thor, This was to be my day of triumph.
loki,It will come. In time.
thor,"Yes, exactly!"
loki,"But there's nothing we can do without defying Father. Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye. Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned."
thor,It's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders.
loki,It's madness!
volstagg,Madness? What sort of madness?
loki,Nothing! Thor was making a jest!
thor,The safety of our Realm is no jest. We're going to Jotunheim.
fandral,What?!
sif,"Thor, of all the laws of Asgard, this is one you must not break. Loki looks on, intrigued by the proceedings."
fandral,"This isn't like a journey to Earth, where you summon a little lightning and thunder and the mortals worship you as a god. This is Jotunheim."
volstagg,"And if the Frost Giants don't kill you, your Father will!"
thor,"My father fought his way into Jotunheim, defeated their armies, and took their Casket! We'd just be looking for answers."
sif,"It is forbidden! Thor sizes up his friends, smiles. He proceeds to make his case with enthusiasm and charismatic conviction."
thor,"My friends, have you forgotten all that we've done together? He turns to Fandral."
fandral,You did.
thor,And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors this Realm has ever known?
sif,I did.
loki,What?
thor,You are coming with me...
loki,"Yes, of course! I won't let my brother march into Jotunheim alone. I will be at his side."
volstagg,And I.
fandral,And I.
hogun,And I. The Warriors Three fight together.
sif,I fear we'll live to regret this.
volstagg,If we're lucky.
thor,We must first find a way to get past Heimdall.
volstagg,That will be no easy task. It's said the Gatekeeper can see a single dew drop fall from a blade of grass a thousand worlds away.
fandral,And he can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim.
volstagg,Jest not! He heareth all!
fandral,"Please. Getting past him should be simple enough now, since he seems to be letting Frost Giants sneak by under his nose. Volstagg, terrified, calls out to the sky."
volstagg,Forgive him! He meaneth no offense! Loki rejoins the group as Thor leads them onward.
loki,"Keep your weapons sheathed and your mouths closed. This is going to take subtlety and sincerity, not brute strength. Leave it to me. Loki dismounts and steps forward."
heimdall,"You're not dressed warmly enough. Thor, Loki, and the others trade looks."
loki,I'm sorry?
heimdall,"The freezing cold of Jotunheim. It will kill you all in time, even Thor."
fandral,"That was just a bit of a jest, really... Loki goes into damage control."
loki,You must be mistaken. We're not--
heimdall,"For ages have I guarded Asgard and kept it safe from those who would do it harm. In all that time, never has an enemy slipped by my watch -- until this day. I wish to know how that happened."
thor,"Then tell no one where we've gone until we've returned. Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group pass. Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles him."
volstagg,What happened? Your silver tongue turn to lead?
loki,Get me off this bridge before it cracks under your girth. Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh.
heimdall,"Be warned. I will honor my sworn oath to protect this Realm as its Gatekeeper. If your return threatens the safety of Asgard, Bifrost will remain closed to you. You'll be left to die in the cold wastes of Jotunheim."
thor,I have no plans to die today.
heimdall,"None do. Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the apparatus of the Observatory starts up."
heimdall,All is ready. You may pass.
volstagg,Couldn't you just leave the bridge open for us?
heimdall,To keep this bridge open would unleash the full power of the Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it.
volstagg,"Ah. Never mind, then. Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others, grins."
thor,"Come on. Don't be bashful. The others join him at his side, then step towards the Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom, changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked off the platform and inside the vortex."
thor,"Come on, big fella. Up...! With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:"
volstagg,This belt! This belt is now my lucky belt! I will never remove it! Even when bathing!
fandral,"You bathe? Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole planet is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun city lies in the distance."
hogun,We shouldn't be here.
thor,Too late now.
fandral,"Actually, it's not. We could turn right around, hop back to Asgard, share a mug by the fire. Could be nice. Thor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious."
loki,Perhaps we should wait. Thor turns back to his brother.
thor,For what?
loki,To survey the enemy. To gauge their strengths and weaknesses from a distance.
volstagg,"I'm liking that. Gauging, surveying. Particularly the distance part."
thor,"We know all we must. It's time to act. Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow."
sif,He's just got to swing his hammer...
thor,"It feels good, doesn't it? To be together again, adventuring on another world?"
fandral,Adventuring? Is that what we're doing?
thor,What would you call it?
fandral,Freezing.
volstagg,Starving.
sif,Whining.
thor,How about a song to lift our spirits? The others groan.
hogun,"No, not that!"
sif,Please don't make us sing again!
fandral,"If I have to listen to Volstagg's singing voice one more time, I'll fall on my own sword!"
sif,"Well, now I'm on board. She and Thor share a grin. The party reaches the edge of the city -- its ancient structures of jade and ice melting and crumbling, ravaged by warfare long ago. A TEMPLE lies before them, across a central plaza."
thor,Hiding. As cowards always do. Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza. Loki reluctantly follows. They don't notice as SHADOWY FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby.
jotun sentry,"What is your business here, Asgardian? The Jotun's voice itself sounds like cracking ice."
thor,I speak only to your King. Not to his foot soldiers.
laufey,"I am Laufey, King of this Realm."
thor,And I am--
laufey,"We know who you are, Odinson. Why have you brought the stench of your blood into my world?"
thor,"I demand answers. Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together."
laufey,"You ""demand?"""
thor,How did your people get into Asgard?
laufey,"The house of Odin is full of traitors. Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a puzzled look, disturbed by the Jotun King's words."
thor,Do not dishonor my father's name with your lies.
laufey,"Your father is a murderer and a thief. He stole what was ours, and left our world in ruins. We have the right to reclaim the Casket."
thor,"Not when you'd use it to make war against other Realms. Laufey laughs, cold, mocking."
laufey,"And why have you come here? To make peace? You long for battle. You crave it. I see you for what you are, Thor Odinson. Nothing but a boy, trying to prove himself a man."
thor,"This boy has grown tired of your mockery. Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores him."
loki,"Thor, stop and think. Look around you. We are outnumbered."
thor,"Know your place, brother..."
laufey,You should listen to his counsel. You know not what your actions would unleash. Laufey steps out of the shadows.
loki,"We will accept your most gracious offer. The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant nearby mutters under his breath."
jotun,"Run back home, little princess. Thor stops in his tracks. Loki goes white. He knows what's coming."
loki,"Damn. In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor. Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them."
volstagg,"Silly hammer! Has a mind of its own! ICE forms on the Jotuns' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR around them, extending off the ends of their arms like SWORDS. One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral."
fandral,"I'm hoping that's just decorative. Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost Giant. His comrades form another circle around him, separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer around once and catches it with a cocky grin. He's enjoying this."
thor,Next! Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.
fandral,"Well? What move, do you think?"
volstagg,"I say we use ""The Norn's Revenge."""
fandral,"At this close range? I think ""The Alfheim Lunge"" is a better move."
hogun,"Shut up! Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle. A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant hurls an ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his mace over his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and hoists himself up, dodging the Giant's blow and leaping over him. Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins back, dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun with his mace. Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to the ground."
sif,"If you don't treat me like a lady, I won't act like a lady! She takes out the Jotun. Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at the edge of a deep crevasse. The Giant sees he's vulnerable, swipes at him. But the Jotun's arm passes right through him. The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the crevasse below. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness."
loki," Pathetic. He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at once. Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE. The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It's a long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back. Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns."
thor,"Come on! At least make it a challenge for me! He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor rises, grins."
sif," I'm so glad I taught him how to do that! Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good hits in."
volstagg,"You may want to put some ice on that! The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind. Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose."
sif,"Of course you did. Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them out."
volstagg,"Hang on! Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously close to hacking into Hogun's legs."
hogun,Watch the legs!
fandral,You really think your icicles are a match for Asgardian steel? Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade away.
volstagg,That's unfortunate. He hurries to his wounded comrade.
fandral,"I may need a bit of help. Not a good look, is it?"
volstagg,Just try not to bleed.
fandral,How's the face?
volstagg,"Flawless. Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice stalagmite. Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost Giants. The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm. Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused. The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the distraction, KICKS the Giant."
thor,"Come on! But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon. Mjolnir falls to the ground. A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the ground, to no avail. Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to leave. From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the wall of the palace, and down to the ground below. The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their feet."
loki,That can't be good.
volstagg,"Yes, it could! Might be an early spring! They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle. Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of the Giants."
loki,"Thor, we must go! Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat of battle."
thor,Then go!
sif,There are too many of them!
thor,I can stop them! The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all around them.
sif,"Thor! But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting."
volstagg,"Run! Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give chase. Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them. The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After a"
thor's fist,"Forces its way up through the middle of the pile of Jotuns. He opens his hand, beckoning. One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind him. He whirls around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him square in the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground with all his might. KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground."
loki,"Likely killed us all! As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them. The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not move, for fear of falling through, into the void below. Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his comrades."
thor,"Loki, we have to see. Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating. But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of the Frost Giants. And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too many, even for a Thunder God."
odin allfather,"Astride his powerful, eight-legged steed SLEIPNIR. He's clad in battle armor, Gungnir in his hand -- an imposing sight."
odin,Laufey. End this.
laufey,Your boy sought this out.
odin,"You're right. These are the actions of a boy. Treat them as such. You and I can stop this before there's further bloodshed. Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice blade at the end of his arm."
laufey,"We are beyond diplomacy now, Allfather. He'll get what he came for -- war and death. Odin looks grim, determined."
odin,"So be it. Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet. The other Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the fleeing Jotuns with delight."
thor,Now! We'll finish them together!
odin,"Silence! Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the Bifrost energy blasting forth from it. The Bifrost envelops the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the hole. The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent. Laufey stares up after them contemptuously."
thor,Why did you bring us back?
odin,Do you realize what you've done? What you've started?
thor,I was protecting my home.
odin,You cannot protect your friends. How can you hope to protect a kingdom? Odin turns to the others.
thor,There won't be a kingdom to protect if you're afraid to act! Odin stares at him.
odin,"That's pride and vanity that talks! Not leadership! Have you forgotten everything I've taught you? What of a warrior's patience, cunning?"
thor,"While you wait and be patient, the Nine Realms laugh at us! The old ways are done. You'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls!"
odin,"You're a vain, greedy, cruel boy!"
thor,"And you are an old man and a fool! The whole world seems to stop at Thor's words. Odin falls quiet. When he speaks again, there's something terrifying beneath the calmness of his words."
odin,"A fool, yes! I was a fool to think you were ready. Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly."
odin,"Thor Odinson... You have disobeyed the express command of your King. Through your arrogance and stupidity, you have opened these peaceful Realms and innocent lives to the horrors of war. The Allfather plunges Gungnir into Observatory's control panel. The turret turns, the Bifrost energy building along with Odin's rage. It FIRES, as the Bifrost opens at the end of the platform, creating a portal behind Thor. Odin turns angrily to his son."
thor's pov,"Thor opens his eyes to see Jane Foster staring at him, concerned. She looks vulnerable and beautiful."
thor,Hammer...
darcy,"Yeah, we can tell you're hammered. That's pretty obvious. Jane notices something on the ground around them. She shines her flashlight down at the sand."
jane,"Erik... look at this. He joins her at her side and sees it. A faint, discernible pattern is etched into the sand. They exchange a look. Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly takes out a camera and snaps some photos of the runes. A breeze begins to blow them away."
selvig,"Jane, we need get him to a hospital. Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the cannister."
jane,Not right now. It'll take too long. County's an hour away. We'll drop him off after we're done here. Selvig looks uncertain.
thor,Father! Heimdall! I know you can hear me! Open the bridge!
jane," Okay, you and Darcy take him to the hospital, I'll stay here."
selvig,"You expect me to leave you alone in the middle of the desert? Thor turns to the others, frustrated."
thor,You! What world is this? The group is intimidated by his fervor.
selvig,"It's all right, my friend. We're going to get you some help. Selvig touches Thor's shoulder. Thor shoves him off, grows agitated, belligerent."
thor,"Where am I?! Answer me! Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it. Jane looks on, concerned."
jane,"Erik, just back away..."
selvig, You're in the desert outside the town of Puente Antiguo.
thor,What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?
darcy,"Uh... New Mexico? Darcy raises a TASER at him. Thor looks at the weapon, unsure what to make of it."
thor,You dare threaten Thor with so puny
darcy,What? He was freaking me out.
admissions nurse,Name?
jane,"He said it was ""Thor."" The Nurse painstakingly types it into the computer, one key at a time. Jane watches as Thor is wheeled out of the room."
jane,I've never met him before.
darcy,Until she hit him with the car.
jane,"Grazed him, actually."
jane,"I told you, I don't know him. I just want to make sure he's okay."
admissions nurse,I'm going to need a name and contact number.
jane,Jane Foster.
selvig,"Oh, for God's sake... He reaches over Jane's shoulder and hands the Nurse his business card."
nurse,"Hi. Just taking a little blood. Thor SLAPS the syringe away angrily, starts to sit up."
thor,How dare you attack the son of Odin!
nurse,"I need some help! Two ORDERLIES race over, try to hold Thor down."
thor,"Then bring me a healing stone, you savages! He hurls one of them off, smashing against a wall. Now a couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas, all struggling to hold Thor down. Medical equipment goes flying, furniture overturned."
orderly,"What the hell is this guy on? Finally, they force him back down onto the gurney. Thor looks shocked and amazed that he's actually being overpowered by this small group. The NURSE injects him with a sedative."
thor,"You're no match for the Mighty-- Thor struggles a beat, then passes out."
townie,Huh.
jane,"Darcy, when you're done, take the soil samples to Professor Meyers in geology. Remind him, he owes me."
selvig,We might want to perform a spectral analysis.
jane,"""We?"""
selvig,"I flew all the way out here -- might as well make myself useful. This is the offer Jane's been waiting for. She gets up, inserts the piece of equipment she's been working on into a rack-mounted server."
jane,You know what would be really useful? Do you still have that friend at LIGO?
selvig,She was more than a friend.
jane,Could you call in a favor?
selvig,You don't think this was just a magnetic storm?
jane,"If I'm right, their observatory must have picked up gravitational waves during last night's event."
selvig,Meaning? Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows.
jane,Meaning these anomalies might signify something bigger.
selvig,"How ""big"" are we talking about? Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and covered with stars."
jane,I think the lensing around the edges is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
darcy,A what?
selvig,I thought you were a science major.
darcy,Political Science. Selvig shoots Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs.
jane,She was the only applicant.
selvig,Stars.
jane,"Yes. But not our stars. She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her excitement."
darcy,"Hey, check it out. Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed."
selvig,Is that...?
jane,"I think I left something at the hospital. As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape of a MAN."
frigga,How could you have done this?
odin,Do you understand what he set in motion? He's taken us to the brink of war!
frigga,But banishment? You would lose him forever? He's your son!
odin,What would you have done?
frigga,"I would not have exiled him to a world of mortals, stripped of his powers, to suffer alone. I would not have had the heart for such cruelty!"
odin,That is why I'm King.
frigga,You can bring him back.
odin,No. His fate is in his own hands now.
thor,"It's not possible. He tries again, mustering all his strength. One of his hands slips free from its restraint."
admissions nurse,"I'm sorry, only relatives can visit patients."
admissions nurse,I thought you said you didn't know him.
jane,"I meant I barely know him anymore. The man he's become. He's changed. I mean, what woman really knows her husband, anyway?"
admissions nurse,"None of us, dear. He's in Room"
jane,Typical. I just lost my most important piece of evidence.
darcy,So now what?
jane,We find him.
selvig,Did you see what he did in there? I don't know if finding him is the best idea.
jane,"I want to know what that thing was, and he may have the answers. We don't have a choice."
darcy,Oo-kay. She pulls out her taser and a can of mace.
selvig,So we're just going to spend the rest of the day looking for him?
jane,"However long it takes. Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up, when --"
jane,I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not doing that on purpose.
thor,"Blue sky... one sun... This is Earth, isn't it?"
darcy,I think you may have hit him with the car one time too many.
volstagg,We should never have let him go.
sif,There was no stopping him.
fandral,"At least he's only banished, not dead. Which is what we'd all be if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone."
volstagg,How did the guard even know? Loki stares at his arm.
loki,I told him.
fandral,What?
loki,I told him to go to Odin after we'd left. Though he should be flogged for taking so long.
volstagg,You told the guard?
loki,I saved our lives! And Thor's. I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.
sif,"Loki, you're the only one who can help Thor now. You must go to the Allfather and convince him to change his mind!"
loki,"And if I do, then what? I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. He's arrogant. He's reckless. He's dangerous. You saw how he was today. Is that what Asgard needs from its King? The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He leaves the room. Hogun stares after him."
sif,"He may speak about the good of Asgard, but he's always been jealous of Thor."
volstagg,"True, but we should be grateful to him. He did save our lives."
hogun,Laufey said there were traitors in the House of Odin. The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun.
fandral,"Why is it every time you choose to speak, it has to be something dark and ominous?"
hogun,"A master of magic could easily bring three Jotuns into Asgard. The others look to Hogun, understanding the implication."
volstagg,No! Surely not!
fandral,"Loki's always been one for mischief, but you're talking about something else entirely."
sif,Who else could elude Heimdall's gaze with tricks of light and shadow?
volstagg,The ceremony was interrupted just before Thor was named King.
sif,We should go to the Allfather.
fandral,"And tell him what? ""Oh, by the way, we think your son just betrayed the throne. And do us a favor. Bring back Thor. There's a good fellow!"""
sif,"It's our duty. If any of our suspicions are right, then all of Asgard is in danger."
loki,Am I cursed?
odin,"No. Put the Casket down. Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly returning to its normal form and color. He stares at his father."
loki,What am I?
odin,You're my son.
loki,"What more than that? Odin doesn't answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened. Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth."
odin,No.
loki,Laufey's son... He desperately struggles to make sense of it all.
odin,You were an innocent child.
loki,"You took me for a purpose, what was it? Odin doesn't answer."
odin,"I thought we could unite our kingdoms one day, bring about an alliance, bring about a permanent peace... through you. But those plans no longer matter."
loki,"So I am no more than another stolen relic, locked up here until you might have use of me."
odin,Why do you twist my words?
loki,You could have told me what I was from the beginning. Why didn't you?
odin,You are my son. My blood. I wanted only to protect you from the truth.
loki,Because I am the monster parents tell their children about at night?
odin,Don't...
loki,It all makes sense now. Why you favored Thor all these years.
odin,Listen...
loki,"Because no matter how much you claim to ""love"" me, you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on the Throne of Asgard! Odin's body begins to shake, he lifts his hand. It starts to move out of synch temporarily, leaving a trail, the effect of the Odinsleep approaching. Loki doesn't notice as Odin tries to fight it off."
odin,Listen to me! Loki strides away towards the exit.
loki,Guards!
eager townie,This'll do it. He yells to the driver.
darcy,"You know, for a crazy homeless guy, he's pretty cut. Jane turns away. Thor emerges from the back room, holding a t-shirt."
jane,"Excuse me... excuse me! She leads him away from the work station. Thor holds up the t-shirt. On the front, it bear a sticker which reads: ""HELLO, MY NAME IS DR. DONALD BLAKE"". Thor looks at it, puzzled. Jane rips the sticker off."
thor,They will suffice. Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on the wall.
jane,You're welcome. Now tell me... Thor studies the frame-grabs with interest. Jane points to his form in the Bifrost photo.
thor,"What does anyone do in the Bifrost? Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word. Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down. Thor moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within the book, curious."
selvig," The Bifrost... Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close to her, looking over her notations. She quickly closes the book."
jane,What exactly is the Bifrost?
frigga,I asked him to be honest with you from the beginning. There should be no secrets in a family.
loki,So why did he lie?
frigga,"He kept the truth from you so that you would never feel different. You are in every way our son, Loki, and we your family. You must know that. Loki takes this in, stares at Odin."
loki,How long will it last?
frigga,I don't know. This time is different. We were unprepared.
loki,I never get used to seeing him like this. The most powerful being in the Nine Realms lying helpless until his body is restored.
frigga,"But he's put it off for so long now, I fear... Loki takes her hand. She's grateful, wipes tears from her eyes."
loki,What hope is there for Thor?
frigga,"There's always a purpose to everything your father does. Thor may yet find a way home. Loki looks troubled by the revelation. He rises, heads for the exit, when they hear the clatter of ARMORED FOOTSTEPS hurriedly approaching."
jane,"Now tell us exactly what happened to you last night. Thor looks her in the eyes, staring, intrigued. Jane gets flustered, looks away."
darcy,And how you could eat an entire box of Pop-Tarts and still be this hungry. Jane shoots her a withering look. Thor downs a cup of coffee.
thor, This drink. I like it.
darcy," Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Isabela makes the best coffee in town. Thor hurls the empty mug at the ground, SHATTERING it."
jane,"Sorry, Izzy. Little accident."
jane, What was that? He doesn't understand. The other patrons stare at him.
thor,It was delicious. I want another.
jane,Then you should just say so!
thor,I just did.
jane,I mean ask for it. Nicely.
thor,I meant no disrespect.
jane,"All right, then no more smashing, deal?"
thor,You have my word.
jane,Good.
isabela,"Morning, Pete. Jake."
townie pete,"The usual, please, Izzy. Isabela pours them a couple cups of coffee."
isabela,"What crater? Jane and Selvig overhear this, exchange a look, turn to the Townies with interest."
townie pete,They're saying some kind of satellite crashed in the desert.
jane," Excuse me, did you say there was a satellite crash?"
darcy,"Oh my God, this is going on Facebook. Darcy whips out her cellphone."
selvig, What did the satellite look like?
thor,Where?!
pete,I wouldn't bother! Looked like the whole Army was coming in when we left!
jane,Where are you going?
thor,Twelve miles east of here. He starts to stride determinedly down the street. Jane walks with him.
jane,Why?
thor,To get what belongs to me.
jane,So now you own a satellite?
thor,It's not what they say it is.
jane,"Whatever it is, the government seems to think it's theirs. You intend to just walk in there and take it?"
thor,Yes. He stops walking.
jane,Everything?
thor,"All the answers you seek will be yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir. Darcy looks to the others."
darcy,"""Myeu-muh?"" What's ""Myeu-muh?"" Jane studies Thor. He looks sincere. She's nearly swayed,"
selvig,Jane. He pulls her aside. Thor can tell that Selvig doesn't much care for him.
jane,You know what we saw last night. This can't be a coincidence. I want to know what's in that crater.
selvig,I'm not talking about the crater. I'm talking about him.
jane,He's promised us answers.
selvig,"He's delusional! Listen to what he's saying! ""Thor."" ""Bifrost."" ""Mjolnir."" These are the stories I grew up with as a child!"
jane,"I'd just be driving him out there, that's all."
selvig,It's dangerous. He's dangerous.
jane,I'm sorry. I can't take you.
thor,I understand. Then this is where we say goodbye. He takes her hand and kisses it.
jane,That's... thank you. Thor bows slightly to each of them.
thor,Jane Foster... Erik Selvig... Darcy. Farewell. He heads off down the street. Selvig looks relieved.
selvig,Now... let's get back to the lab. We have work to do. Selvig and Darcy turn and start to go. Jane looks after Thor as he walks away down the street.
sif,"Allfather, we must speak with you"
loki,"Sitting sprawled upon his father's throne. He wears his horned ceremonial headdress and holds GUNGNIR in his hand. Sif and the others look up, shocked at the sight before them."
volstagg,What is this?
loki,My friends... you haven't heard? I am now Ruler of Asgard.
fandral,Where is Odin?
loki,Father's fallen into the Odinsleep. My mother fears he may never awaken again.
sif,We would speak with her. Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a look. Loki notices.
loki,"She has refused to leave my father's bedside. You can bring your ""urgent"" matter to me, your King. Sif covers quickly."
sif,We would ask you to end Thor's banishment.
loki,"My first command can not be to undo the Allfather's last. We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim. Our people must have a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times. Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of this."
fandral,Of course. Sif and the Warriors Three bow their heads and exit. Loki stares after them.
jane,Hey! That's my stuff!
jane,What the hell is going on here?! The Agents ignore her as Agent Coulson approaches.
coulson,"Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson, with"
jane,"I don't care who you work for, you can't do this!"
selvig,Jane. This is more serious than you realize. Let it go.
jane,Let it go?! This is my life!
coulson,We're here investigating a security threat. We need to appropriate your equipment and all your atmospheric data.
jane,"By ""appropriate"" you mean ""steal?"" Instead of answering, Coulson gives her a check."
coulson,This should more than compensate you for your trouble. She throws the check to the ground without looking at it.
jane,I can't just pick up replacements from RadioShack! I made most of that equipment myself!
coulson,Then I'm sure you can do it again.
jane,And I'm sure I can sue you for violating my constitutional rights!
coulson,"We're the good guys, Ms. Foster. He tries to walk away, but Jane blocks his path. She is fully herself, fueled by outrage."
jane,So are we! We're on the verge of
understanding something,extraordinary. Jane holds up her notebook.
coulson,Thank you for your cooperation. He gets into a car. The cars and trucks pull away.
jane,"Years of research, gone."
darcy,They even took my iPod.
selvig,And your back-ups?
jane,Look around! They took our back- ups. They took the back-ups of our back-ups.
darcy,"I just downloaded, like, thirty songs on there."
selvig,"No one knows much about them. But I knew a scientist -- a pioneer in gamma radiation. SHIELD showed up, and he was never heard from again."
jane,I'm not going to let them do this. I'm getting everything back.
selvig,"Please, let me contact one of my colleagues. Dr. Pym has had some dealings with these people. I'll e- mail him and see if he can help."
darcy,"They took your laptop, too. Annoyed, Selvig thinks."
selvig,I'll just be a minute. He climbs out and heads inside. Jane looks down the street and sees something that intrigues her.
thor,I need a horse.
thor,"Then give me one of those, large enough to ride. The Pet Store Clerk looks confused. Just then, Thor hears a CAR HORN. He turns to the open door. Across the street, Jane calls to him from the Pinzgauer."
jane,You still want a lift?
jane,I've never done anything like this before! Have you ever done anything like this before? Thor looks amused by her excitement.
thor,Many times. You're brave to do it.
jane,They just stole my entire life's work. I really don't have anything left to lose.
thor,But you're clever. Far more clever than anyone else in this Realm.
jane,"""This Realm?"" Why do you talk like that?"
thor,"You think me strange? Jane laughs, catches herself."
jane,Yeah. Just a little.
thor,Good strange or bad strange?
jane,"I'm not quite sure yet. She looks at him, sees him staring at her. She's lost in his gaze, distracted, when the PINZGAUER LURCHES. She quickly turns her eyes forward, regains control of the car."
thor,You'll see soon enough.
jane,You promised me answers.
thor,What you seek -- it's a bridge.
jane,A bridge? Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?
thor,More like a rainbow bridge.
jane,"God, I hope you're not crazy."
jane,"That isn't a satellite crash. They would have hauled the wreckage away, not built a city around it. Thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her."
thor,You're going to need this.
jane,Why?-- Thunder RUMBLES overhead. She stares at him intently and takes his jacket.
thor,"Stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I will return what they stole from you."
jane,"No! Look what's down there! You can't just walk in, grab our stuff, and walk out!"
thor,No. Jane looks relieved.
jane,Wait... But Thor is already headed towards the crater.
techie,"Feed from the keyhole. Can barely penetrate the cloud cover. The Techie hikes a thumb at another monitor, SQUELCHING with static. It shows an SAR shot of the area, laid over a terrain map."
sitwell,"Reroute it, like all the others."
techie,Right. Can I get the passengers some free drinks for the trouble? Sitwell glares at him.
sitwell," DeLancey, Jackson -- check it out."
agent delancey,"Jackson? The Agents reach for their weapons. Thor elbows the driver across the jaw, causing him to drop his weapon. Jackson slumps over the steering wheel, as DeLancey starts to raise a shotgun at Thor. Thor grabs the barrel, yanks it out of DeLancey's hands and thrusts the hilt back, smashing the Agent's jaw. Thor reaches into the jeep to grab a rain slicker."
shield agent,Agents down! We've got a perimeter breach!
sitwell, Get Coulson. Sitwell punches an alarm.
jane,"Erik, okay, first of all, don't worry. I'm perfectly fine, really. More sounds of MAYHEM come from the base."
coulson,I want eyes up high. With a gun. Now!
coulson,Barton. Talk to me.
thor,You're big. Thor grins.
jane,No...
coulson,Barton...
coulson,"Ground units, move in. Show's over. As the Agents surround him, Thor doesn't seem to notice or care. He just sits there on his knees, head bowed in the rain -- a man broken, lost. From overhead, we see the hammer in the cube containment room. We pull up as the Guards approach Thor, then continue to climb, until we see the whole camp -- and the extensive damage Thor's done to it during the melee."
jane,I can't just leave him there.
selvig,Why not?
jane,You didn't see what happened. Darcy points at an illustration of Thor's hammer in the book.
darcy,"Hey! Myeu-muh! Jane looks at the illustration in the book, turns to Selvig knowingly."
selvig,In the children's section. I wanted to show you how ridiculous his story was. Jane is unconvinced by this. She knows he wants to believe.
jane,"Aren't you the one who's always told me to chase down all leads, all possibilities?"
selvig,"I was talking about science, not magic!"
jane,Magic's just science we don't understand yet. Arthur C. Clarke.
selvig,Who wrote science fiction.
jane,The precursor of science fact.
selvig,In some cases.
jane,"If that's really an Einstein-Rosen Bridge out there, then there's something on the other side."
selvig,Jane...
darcy,"A primitive culture like the Vikings might have worshipped them as deities. They give her a look, surprised by her unexpectedly insightful input. Darcy shrugs. Jane points at her, grateful for the support."
jane,Yes! Exactly! Thank you! Darcy beams.
selvig,"Jane, if you do this, you'll find yourself in a situation that I won't be able to get you out of this time."
darcy,"I'll help you. Jane looks grateful. Selvig looks at her, sees there's no stopping her. He sighs."
coulson,It's not easy to do what you did. You made us all look like a bunch of mall cops. That's hurtful.
thor,Just a man.
coulson,"One way or another, we find out what we want to know. We're good at that. Coulson leaves the room. Thor lowers his head."
thor,Loki? What are you doing here?
loki,I had to see you.
thor,What's happened? Tell me! Is it Jotunheim? Let me explain to
loki,"Father is dead. Thor stares at him, stunned."
thor,What?
loki,"Your banishment, the threat of a new war, it was too much for him to bear. The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's responsible for his father's fate. Loki draws close to him, looks in his eyes, consolingly."
thor,Can I come home?
loki,The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.
thor,But couldn't we find a way to--
loki,"Mother has forbidden your return. Thor nods, lowers his head, beaten."
thor,"No, I'm sorry. Loki... thank you for coming here."
loki,"Nothing could have stopped me. Coulson enters the room, but seems to take no notice of Loki."
thor,Good-bye.
coulson,Good-bye? I just got back. Thor looks up to see that Loki is gone.
coulson,"""Donald Blake?"""
selvig,Doctor Donald Blake. He's part of our team.
coulson,"You have dangerous coworkers, Dr. Selvig."
selvig,"Troubled, not dangerous. He was distraught when he found out that you'd taken all of our research. It was years of his life, gone! He got depressed, started drinking, and... well, you know the rest."
coulson,Uh-huh. You mind if we take a moment to verify his identity?
selvig,Certainly. The Techie at a computer nearby runs the name.
coulson,That doesn't explain how he managed to tear through our security. Selvig shrugs.
selvig,Steroids. He's a bit of a fitness nut.
coulson,It says here he's an M.D.
selvig,"He is. That is, he was. He switched careers and became a physicist. He's quite brilliant, really."
coulson,"Release Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig here. The Techie looks to him, surprised."
selvig,Thank you.
selvig,"Donny, Donny, Donny! There you are! Thor looks up, unsure what the hell is going on. Selvig pulls Thor to his feet, gives him a warm hug."
coulson,Just keep him away from the bars.
selvig,I will!
selvig,"To get a drink. Selvig and Thor climb into the SUV. As they drive off, Coulson turns to the other two agents -- GARRETT and CALE."
coulson,Follow them.
laufey,Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.
loki,I've come alone and unarmed.
laufey,To what end?
loki,To make you another proposition.
loki,You're welcome.
laufey,"My men are dead, and I have no Casket. You are a deceiver. Laufey lashes out, grabs Loki around the throat, but Loki calmly stands his ground."
loki,"You have no idea what I am. The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the guards stare in shock. Loki grins."
laufey,"Ah, the bastard son. I thought Odin had killed you. That's what I would have done. He's as weak as you are."
loki,"No longer weak. I now rule Asgard, until Odin awakens. Perhaps you should not have so carelessly abandoned me. This gives Laufey pause."
laufey,Or perhaps it was the wisest choice I've ever made. I will hear you.
loki,"I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers, lead you into his chambers, and let you slay him where he lies. I'll keep the throne, and you will have the Casket. Laufey studies Loki's face."
laufey,Why would you do this?
loki,"When all is done, we will have a permanent peace between our two worlds. Then I, the bastard son, will have accomplished what Odin and Thor never could."
laufey,This is a great day for Jotunheim. Asgard is finally ours.
loki,"No. Asgard is mine. The rest of the Nine Realms will be yours, if you do as you're told. Laufey considers the proposition."
laufey,"I accept. Loki turns to leave. As he goes, the slightest trace of a smile crosses his face."
loki,"What troubles you, Gatekeeper?"
heimdall,"I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim, but could neither see nor hear you. You were shrouded from me, like the Frost Giants who entered this Realm."
loki,Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.
heimdall,"Or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see. Loki sizes him up, smiles."
loki,"You have great power, Heimdall. Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?"
heimdall,No.
loki,And why is that?
heimdall,"Because he is my King, and I am sworn to obey him."
loki,Exactly. Just as you're sworn to obey me now. Yes? A beat.
heimdall,Yes.
loki,Good. Then you will open the Bifrost to no one until I have undone what my brother has started. Loki heads out of the Observatory. Heimdall stares after him.
selvig,"Seems Darcy's a terrible intern, but a talented hacker."
thor,Thank you for what you've done.
selvig,Don't thank me. I only did it for Jane.
thor,Are you in love with her?
selvig,"Of course not! Jane's like a daughter to me. Her father and I taught at University together. A good man, but he never listened. This registers with Thor."
thor,Neither did I. Selvig eyes him with interest.
selvig,"I don't know if you're really delusional, and I really don't care at this point. I just care about her. I've seen the way she looks at you."
thor,"I swear to you, I mean her no harm."
selvig,"Good. If that's the case, then I'll buy you one more drink, and you'll leave town tonight. A long pause, then Thor nods. He takes a drink."
thor,I had it all backwards. I had it all wrong. Selvig watches him keenly. This is a different Thor than he's seen before.
selvig,"It's not a bad thing, finding out that you don't have all the answers. That's when you start asking the right questions. Thor takes this in."
thor,"For the first time in my life, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do."
selvig,Anyone who's ever going to find their way in this world has to start by admitting they don't know where the hell they are. Thor nods.
thor,I have no quarrel with you. But she's a lady. You should be more respectful.
drunk townie,"And you should shut the hell up, princess. Selvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it. But, to his surprise, Thor remains unaffected by the Townie's baiting."
selvig,"Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our heads. Just then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out. Thor's impressed. Selvig downs his drink, then hurls his glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground."
thor,Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his shoulder.
jane,Erik!
thor,He's fine. Not injured at all.
jane,What happened?
thor,We drank. We fought. He made his ancestors proud.
jane,"Put him on the bed. Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes."
selvig,I still don't believe you're the God of Thunder.
thor,These are your chambers? Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up the mess around her.
jane,"Well, it's more of a temporary living space, really. I don't usually have visitors in here. Actually, never... Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from him, puts it away."
jane,I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to reconcile particle data. Or when Darcy's driving me crazy.
thor,You've been very kind. I've been far less grateful than you deserve.
jane,"I also hit you with my car a couple times, so it kind of evens out. He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her"
thor,It was all I could get back. Not as much as I promised. I'm sorry.
jane,"No, this is good. Thank you. This means I don't have to start from scratch... She sits down and opens the notebook eagerly, then stops, a harsh realization clouding her face. Thor notices."
thor,What's wrong?
jane,"SHIELD, whatever they are. They're never going to let this research see the light of day."
thor,You must do this. You must finish what you've started.
jane,Why?
thor,Because you're right. It's taken so many generations for your people to get to this point. You're nearly there. You just need someone to show you how close you really are.
jane,What is it?
thor,This is how my father explained it to me...
fandral,"Our dearest friend banished, Loki on the throne, Asgard on the brink of war, yet you manage to consume four wild boar, six pheasant, a side of beef, and two casks of ale. Shame on you! Don't you care?! Fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire, but Volstagg pulls his weapon, stopping him."
volstagg,Do not mistake my appetite for apathy.
sif,"Stop it, both of you! We all know what we have to do, we're just too damned afraid to do it!"
fandral,"It's treason, Hogun."
volstagg,"To hell with treason, it's suicide."
fandral,"Yes, yes, we know!"
sif,Thor would do the same for us. An EINHERJAR GUARD enters. They tense.
einherjar guard,Heimdall demands your presence. Volstagg quickly drains his flagon of ale.
volstagg,We're doomed.
selvig,I need some coffee. The three head inside Smith Motors.
darcy,Thanks.
thor,"You're very welcome. Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates. She and Thor sit with the others and start to eat their breakfast, looking like a little family."
agent garrett,They want an update.
agent cale,Tell them he's eating eggs.
agent garrett,Scrambled or fried? Cale glares at him.
darcy,Sure.
thor,Thank you. Excuse me a moment. Thor leaves.
thor,To replace the one I broke. Please forgive my behavior.
isabel,Okay. Thank you.
thor,"If I may, I'd like to come back for more of your ""coffee."""
isabel,"Any time. He nods and walks away. She stares after him, smiling, and shrugs."
volstagg,"Good Heimdall, less us explain--"
heimdall,"You would defy the commands of Loki our King, break every oath you have taken as warriors, and commit treason to bring Thor back? The four exchange nervous glances."
sif,"Yes, but--"
heimdall,Good. The group looks puzzled. What did he just say?
volstagg,So you'll help us?
heimdall,"I am bound by honor to our King. I cannot open the Bifrost to you. With that, Heimdall leaves them alone in the Observatory. The others exchange puzzled looks."
fandral,"Complicated fellow, isn't he?"
volstagg,"Now what do we do? Sif glances at the control panel, notices something."
sif,"Look! The others turn to see HEIMDALL'S SWORD stuck into the control panel. They exchange a grin. They have an ally. Sif hits the controls, and the Bifrost apparatus fires up."
coulson,What the hell was that?
techie,"I don't know, sir. We got massive energy readings out of nowhere, then they just disappeared. Fifteen miles due northwest."
coulson,Let's go take a look.
volstagg,He must have landed nearby. It's time to put our tracking skills to work. Spread out. Check the sand for indentations of his boot prints.
fandral,The winds would have blown them away by now. We should look for signs of a campfire.
sif,"Or we could just start there. She points behind them to the town of Puente Antiguo in the distance -- the only visible sign of civilization -- and to Hogun, who has already started walking towards it. Volstagg and Fandral trade looks, their egos bruised."
fandral,"It's worth a look, I suppose. The party tromps towards the town."
sif,It has been a thousand years...
volstagg,"Things change so fast here. You leave for a millennium, and it's like the whole neighborhood's gone. Volstagg sniffs, smells something."
agent garrett,Is there a Renaissance Faire in town?
agent cale,"Call it in. But before they can, Volstagg rises up behind them, smashes their heads together. They're out."
volstagg,"Never cared for spies. He starts to go, then sees their bag of fast food on the ground. Intrigued, he pulls out a cheeseburger and takes a bite. He likes what he tastes."
einherjar guard,"My liege, the Warriors Three and the Lady Sif have gone missing. Loki reacts. He knows who's responsible."
heimdall,"Tell me, Loki, how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard?"
loki,"You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of the Realm? There are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind. But I have need of them no longer, now that I am King."
heimdall,"Then I need no longer obey you. Heimdall raises his massive sword, strides towards Loki. Loki reaches out and, with both hands, takes hold of something invisible, hovering in mid-air before him. As it quickly fades into view, we realize what it is --"
loki,Ensure my brother does not return.
thor,"My friends! Thor happily races over and greets his comrades. Jane, Selvig, and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the room. Jane looks concerned. Selvig and Darcy eye them with wonder."
selvig,I don't believe it...
darcy,Who are they?
volstagg,"Lady Sif and the Warriors Three. Surely you've heard tales of Hogun the Grim, Fandral the Dashing, and I, Volstagg the Svelte? Selvig looks pointedly at Volstagg's massive gut."
thor,"My friends, I've never been happier to see anyone. But you should not have come."
fandral,We're here to take you home. Jane reacts to the news of Thor leaving.
thor,You know I can't. My father is dead because of me. I must remain in exile. The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks.
sif,Thor... your father still lives. Thor reacts to the revelation.
coulson,"Get somebody from Linguistics out here. Just then, they hear a RUMBLING overhead, as the Bifrost storm ROARS in the sky above. Coulson and the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, their vehicle windshields SHATTERING, as the Bifrost storm grows in strength. Finally, the hole in the sky overhead opens, and the funnel cloud EXPLODES out of it, touching down onto the desert floor. Coulson and the Agents shelter their eyes from the maelstrom."
darcy,"Was somebody else coming? Just then, the Bifrost funnel EXPLODES down to the ground."
coulson,I don't think so. But the guy doesn't tell me anything.
thor,Leave this town now. Get yourself and your friends to safety.
jane,What about you?
thor,I must stay and fight. The Asgardians look to Thor.
volstagg,You're but a mortal now. You'll get yourself killed!
fandral,"Or one of us, trying to protect you."
sif,"The best thing you can do is get the mortals to safety and leave the battle to us. Thor looks at the townsfolk around them, all oblivious to the oncoming threat."
loki,Father. Welcome to Asgard.
the destroyer,"Strides down the street, a red, fiery energy glowing from within it. It unleashes BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting storefronts aflame."
sif,Keep him distracted. She hurries off. The Warriors Three continue towards the behemoth.
fandral,"What do you think? ""The Svartalfheim Twist?"" ""Kiss of the Hag?"" ""Face Full of Boot?"" Volstagg grins eagerly."
volstagg,"""The Flying Mountain."" Hogun and Fandral groan."
fandral,"Not ""The Flying Mountain!"" It threw out my back for a year last time!"
volstagg,"Trust me, it'll work."
volstagg,For Asgaaaaard!!!
sif,"Leaps off a nearby rooftop with her two-headed spear and plunges it deep into the back of the creature. The creature stands there motionless, the fire dimming in its faceplate, Sif standing atop its back. The Asgardians have a brief moment of hope. But the creature stirs with life, its fire igniting once again. Sif looks on with growing trepidation. Slowly, unnaturally, the Destroyer spins its torso around 180 degrees to face its attackers. The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif. She barely dives off of the behemoth in time, dodging the blast. The Destroyer rises again to its full height, pulling free from Sif's staff, the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor. Sif and the Warriors Three try to regroup, when the Destroyer unleashes another blast, sending Sif and her comrades flying in all directions. Hogun's POUCH OF HEALING STONES breaks free, landing in the middle of the street."
jane,"Erik! She and Thor hurry to his side. He's losing blood, going into shock."
thor,"Come on... give me one! Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still intact. Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over the end of the iron rod."
jane,"What are you doing? What is that? As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it. Jane looks on, amazed, as the glowing powder falls upon the piece of iron, dissolving it, heading downwards, until it reaches Selvig's wound. The powder heals his wound completely. Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment. He reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed flesh."
selvig, I'm really starting to like him. Jane turns to Thor to find he's gone.
thor,"Go, while you can!"
sif,But the others...
thor,You can't help them now. Your job is to survive. She struggles to sit up.
sif,No! I will die a warrior's death. Stories will be told of this day-- He gently takes her shield from her.
thor,"Live and tell those stories yourself. At last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious, with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way towards them. Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to pull him to safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He rouses Hogun and Fandral."
fandral,No. We can still fight!
thor,"But not win. Move Volstagg, or he'll die! Thor looks at them, grins."
selvig,"Jane, no! He pulls her into Smith Motors. A RAVEN flies overhead, watching the scene --"
jane,Oh. My. God.
coulson,Donald... I don't think you've been completely honest with me.
darcy,"So, how can you speak our language?"
volstagg,"Your language? Ha! Silly girl, you're speaking ours. Thor calls up to the sky."
thor,Heimdall! Open the Bifrost!
thor,He would open it if he could. I fear the worst.
volstagg,Then we're trapped here forever.
fandral,"Then I suppose we'd best start settling into our new lives. He looks to Darcy, turns on the charm."
darcy,No. Thor shouts back up to the sky.
thor,Heimdall!
volstagg,"Primitive. Good enough for hunting small game, I suppose. Suddenly, the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the sky. Thor grins. The mortals look on, amazed. Fandral turns to Darcy."
fandral,"Sorry, my love. These things happen."
thor,"Know this, son of Coul. You and I, we fight for the same cause -- the protection of this world. From this day forward, count me as your ally."
coulson,Not stolen. Borrowed. Jane shoots him a look. Coulson quickly continues.
thor,"Whatever fate lies before me, you are part of it. He takes her in his arms, kisses her passionately. Thor and the Asgardians leap into the Bifrost."
thor, Get him to the healing room! Leave my brother to me.
laufey,"It's said you can still see and hear what transpires around you, even in this state. I hope it's true, so that you may know your death came by the hand of Laufey. He raises his blade above Odin's body, when --"
loki,And your death came by the son of Odin.
frigga,"Standing behind him -- the sword stuck in his back. She looks to Loki, takes him in her arms."
frigga,"Thor! She moves to Thor and hugs him, but Thor's eyes remain fixed on his brother. Loki looks at Mjolnir in his brother's hand."
loki,"Found its way back to you, did it?"
thor,No thanks to you. Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons.
frigga,What?
thor,"Why don't you tell her? How you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends? To kill me? Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused."
loki,It must have been enforcing Father's last command.
thor,"You're a talented liar, brother. Always have been."
thor,Jotunheim...
loki,"All these years, and no one's ever dared to use it as a weapon. Thor hurries to the ice, raises his hammer to SMASH through it to get to the controls frozen within. Before he can, Loki fires Gungnir. The blast hits the ice in front of Thor, blasting him back across the floor. Loki steps down from the ice as Thor staggers to his feet."
thor,Why have you done this?
loki,"To do what Father never could. To destroy their kind forever. When he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of what I've done."
thor,He won't! You can't kill an entire race!
loki,"What is this newfound love for the Frost Giants? You, who would have killed them all with your bare hands."
thor,I've changed.
loki,So have I. Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir.
thor,Is the throne really worth what you've done? What you would become?
loki,I never wanted the throne. I only wanted to be your equal. Now fight me!
thor,"I will not fight you, brother."
loki,I am not your brother. I never was.
thor,"Loki, this is madness... Loki grins."
loki,"Is it? He FIRES Gungnir at Thor. Thor dodges the blast, rolls to his feet."
selvig,Jane?
jane,Something's wrong.
loki,"If you care so much for the Jotuns, then die with them. The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand towards the Bifrost. MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand. The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his brother."
loki,"Thor! Help me! Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking up at him desperately."
lokis,I was always more clever than you.
thor,"Yet still not clever enough. With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air, summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the Lokis. All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir knocked from his grasp. Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps away. Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's pinned to the ground. Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to do. Loki watches him smugly."
loki,"Look at you, the Mighty Thor. With all your strength, what good does it do you now? Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's happening. He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet, VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea. He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice. Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The hammer goes flying to his grasp. Loki looks confused."
thor,"Forgive me. Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow -- KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING out of it. Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes. The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART. As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out from the broken Bridge. They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized by the debris, when --"
odin allfather,"Standing on the edge of the broken Bridge, awakened from the Odinsleep, restored to his full strength. Loki searches his father's face, looking for some kind of approval, some kind of redemption, but all he sees is disappointment and regret. Loki lets go."
odin,It is over.
jane,It's gone.
volstagg,"...and then, with a mighty bellow, I flew at the great metal beast and laid it low..."
fandral,Is that another way of saying you fell on your huge a--
volstagg,"As a matter of fact, falling down was a tactic. Lulling the Destroyer into a false sense of security!"
fandral,"Well, I was the one who had to drag your enormous carcass off the battlefield. That makes me the real hero. Doesn't it, Hogun? Hogun points to Volstagg."
hogun,Big stomach.  Big mouth. The other gathered Asgardians laugh. Volstagg and Fandral look to Hogun. The grim warrior gives just a trace of a smile.
fandral,"Well, how about that? A smile! I'd say that calls for another drink! They laugh and raise another round. Frigga sits nearby, lost in thought, her face betraying the sadness she struggles to conceal. Sif notices, approaches Frigga, bows her head."
sif,My Queen. I am so sorry for your loss. Frigga takes Sif's hand appreciatively.
frigga,"Thank you, Sif. She looks to Thor, who's unable to enjoy the merriment around him."
sif,He mourns for his brother. And he misses her. The mortal. Frigga sees the trace of regret in Sif's face as she looks at Thor with new feelings. He rises and leaves the hall.
frigga,He will need his friends now more than ever.
sif,"I will always be at his side. Frigga understands, puts her arm around Sif gratefully."
odin,You'll be a wise King.
thor,There will never be a wiser king than you. Or a better father.
odin,"You've already made me proud. Odin leaves, Thor consoled by his words."
thor,"Can you see her? Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth."
heimdall,Yes.
thor,How is she?
darcy,Here you go.
jane,Thanks. Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.
darcy,He would have come back if he could.
jane,"I know. But if he can't get here on his own... Jane hits a switch on the device. Suddenly, a 3-D HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device, bathing the two women in its glow. We recognize what it is -- YGGDRASIL, in all its beauty."
