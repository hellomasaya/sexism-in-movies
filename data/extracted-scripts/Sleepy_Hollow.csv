Speaker,Dialogue
third draft,4/10/95
constable one,Where are you?!
man,I need your help with this.
constable one,Constable Crane?  Ichabod Crane... is that you?
ichabod,"Yes, it is me.  But, not only me...  I found someone here..."
ichabod,Someone quite dead.
high constable,Burn it.
constable one,"Yes, sir."
ichabod,Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
high constable,He drowned.  Anyone could see.
ichabod,There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs...
high constable,He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
ichabod,I could determine if he were dead before he went into the Hudson.
high constable,Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
magistrate,"Yes, must we?"
ichabod,"There is nothing heretical about science, sir.  The Chinese have written on it for hundreds of years... procedural study used to solve seemingly unsolvable crimes."
ichabod,"Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement."
high constable,Have they nothing to fear presently?
ichabod,"Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts."
high constable,"And, with disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure."
ichabod,"But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?"
high constable,"Very few, if any."
ichabod,"Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?"
high constable,"For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism."
ichabod,Not Liberalism.  Equanimity.
magistrate," Um, sir... might I suggest..."
high constable," The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you."
ichabod,Chosen me?
high constable,"These ""methods"" of yours... there has been no practical application."
ichabod,Not for lack of trying.
high constable,Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
ichabod," I shall, gladly."
high constable,"Excellent.  Then, you are excused till morning."
high constable,"Oh, and, Constable...  Do make certain that you meet with success.  Otherwise... perhaps you should not come back at all."
blindfolded woman,This is such a silly game.
brom,Be a sport and stop complaining.
little girl,Play along.  You must.
blindfolded woman,"There, I have someone.  Am I finished?"
little girl,You have to tell who it is.
little girl,At least make a guess.
blindfolded woman,I don't know.  Is it Brom Bones?
brom,Certainly not.
ichabod,"Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense."
katrina,"Forgive me, I didn't know."
ichabod,I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
brom,"We haven't heard your name yet, friend."
ichabod,"Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine."
brom,You need some manners.
katrina,Brom!
baltus,"Can I help you, sir?"
ichabod,I have been sent from the city with a letter of introduction. I am told you offer me room and board.
ichabod,If we could speak alone.
baltus," This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?"
katrina,"They're only children, father."
baltus,"That will be all, ladies.  We are joined by Doctor Thomas Lancaster, Constable.  And to his left are, Clergyman Steenwyck and our able magistrate, Samuel Philipse, both keeping order in their own ways."
baltus,"I myself am in charge of financial matters and the regulation of currency in our commonwealth.  And, lastly, this fine fellow is James Hardenbrook, our Notary."
ichabod,"An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?"
doctor lancaster,Excuse me?
ichabod,"I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?"
doctor lancaster,I was afraid of this.
philipse,"Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia."
ichabod,The militia?
father steenwyck,Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
ichabod,"All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies..."
father steenwyck,The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all.
hardenbrook,Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
ichabod,Pardon me?
baltus,"You have not been well informed of our troubles, sir.  If you would..."
baltus,"The Horseman... he was a Hessian mercenary, sent to our shores by German princes to help keep Americans under the thumb of England.  However, unlike his compatriots who came as muscle in trade for currency, he came willingly.  For love of carnage."
philipse,Cut off his head with his own sword. It's a legend told for twenty years.
baltus,"But, only recently has the Headless Hessian been seen prowling the Hollow, in search of a head to suit his shoulders."
ichabod,Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
hardenbrook," When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!"
doctor lancaster,No one knows why he chose to now to climb out from his grave.
father steenwyck,It is very clear why.  Citizens here have long tried to hide sins behind closed doors.  Their failed faith has saturated the soil and called forth one of Satan's own.
ichabod,"Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?"
baltus,Many have.
ichabod,"Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes."
ichabod,"While I will do everything I can to find your assassin, I will look for a man of flesh and blood.  Not some goblin-demon from hell."
philipse,Gather round!  Gather and quiet! The hour has come to choose for this night.  Each man's name is in this box and has been checked.
philipse,"May the Lord watch over him...  ""Jonathan Masbath.""  Are you here?"
young masbath,"No, father.  Wait...  He's already been up once.  Why does he go again?"
jonathan,"It is a lottery, son.  It just as easily might have been one of them."
young masbath,Then... I go with you.
jonathan,"No.  You obey my wishes.  Brom.  Look after him, will you?"
philipse,Someone leave him a horse.
ichabod,"You worry for naught, little man. Nothing will harm him there.  It is problems here on the ground you people need begin to worry about."
katrina,"Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day."
ichabod,Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
katrina,"You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?"
ichabod,Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
katrina,"Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business."
ichabod,"Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of..."
katrina,Other people?
ichabod,Small talk.
katrina,It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
katrina,"Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?"
ichabod,Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
katrina,My suitor?
ichabod,"The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call ""friend,"" he misplaces a good portion of jealousy."
katrina,He has proposed to me twice.
ichabod,"Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was ""no"" at least once."
katrina,I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
ichabod,"Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman."
jonathan,"Come out, devil... come...."
katrina,"Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it."
ichabod,Are you so superstitious?
katrina,"To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black."
ichabod,There is no such thing as magic.
katrina,"Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?"
ichabod,Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
katrina, You are funny.
baltus,"Constable, where are you going!?"
baltus,"Come back, sir...  Madness."
ichabod,"The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next..."
philipse,And now Jonathan Masbath.
ichabod," Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?"
philipse,He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
philipse,Van Ripper there...
philipse,"... found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?"
ichabod, You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
ichabod," Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now."
young masbath," I did not ask you to, did I?"
doctor lancaster, The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
father steenwyck,Your superiors are two days away!
ichabod,Why was I not told of this?
father steenwyck,"The devil sent you, Ichabod Crane. The Lord will not forgive your sins."
katrina,These are strange... may I?
katrina,"You made this, and the drawings?"
ichabod,If you want.  But...
ichabod," Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust."
young masbath,"Um.... excuse me, sirs..."
philipse," Because of the Horseman, our migrant workers flee for their lives.  There is a danger that our crops will rot. So, if you are going to help us, you stop the Horseman.  That is your task... to kill an undead thing."
ichabod,Listen to what you say....
philipse,Oh my... oh my oh my oh my...
young ichabod,No... mother... no... !
third man,You are certain it was she?
freakish woman,"In the lighting, I did see her.  Her.  Lady Crane..."
freakish woman,"I will never forget.  The next moment, I found my infant dead... with the blood welt on his breast."
mother,Don't be afraid...
katrina,Are you hungry?
katrina,You promised justice.
ichabod,"If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?"
katrina,People have put their trust in you.
katrina,"Won't they still have that justice?  Or, was it a vain promise?"
young masbath,Constable Crane... something has happened.
brom,The men who did this have been taken. We do not need you here.
ichabod,The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
ichabod,His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself.  Someone out there cared for him.
young masbath,Where are we going?
ichabod, Out there.  What do you see?
ichabod, Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
ichabod," Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business."
young masbath, Father said witches live there.
katrina,Why would you do such a thing?
ichabod," If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber."
ichabod, I hear nothing.
ichabod,We have apparently arrived.
ichabod,Pardon.  You did not answer when I knocked.  Are we intruding?
old crone,You are from the Hollow?
ichabod,"In a way, yes."
ichabod,The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
old crone,Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
young masbath,Were you a friend to the Indian?  You should have this... if you were his friend.
old crone,You seek remedy against the Horseman?
old crone, You stay.  Follow with me.
old crone,I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
ichabod,The Horseman.  Yes.
old crone,Sit.
ichabod,What... what are you doing?
old crone, Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
ichabod,Excuse me... um...
ichabod, Do not move.
ichabod,What God-forsaken hell is this?
ichabod,Christ...
ichabod,"The wound is neither smooth nor cauterized, but jagged.  She bleeds like a fountain."
ichabod,She did not go quietly.
angry man,"Step aside, Constable.  Step aside..."
ichabod,What are you doing?
father steenwyck,Let her burn!  Let her burn!
katrina,Stop this!  Leave them alone!
brom," I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this..."
young ichabod,"She was with me, father."
father,Nothing can be done against them.
young ichabod,She was with me that night.
young ichabod,May I see her?
third man,Go home.
young ichabod,May I see my mother?
third man,You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
young ichabod,She did not do it... please listen...
third man,She is guilty.
young ichabod,"No, sir, please... she is innocent..."
third man,She has confessed.
young ichabod,No.
ichabod,Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
katrina,The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
ichabod,"No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it."
ichabod, Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
ichabod, True enough.
ichabod,Katrina.  Why do you follow?
katrina,I apologize if I worried you.
ichabod,Come along.
young masbath,You were right... it does draw attention to itself.
ichabod,Blood.
katrina,What did you say?
young masbath,What is it?
ichabod,Stay back.
katrina,What are you doing?
ichabod,Just... keep where you are.
ichabod, Bring the shovel.
ichabod,"His next victim is chosen!  Give me distance, then guide her back to the Hollow."
young masbath,Constable!
thomas,"May I be excused, father?"
killian,Do you deserve to be?
third man, I think so.
killian," Then, go."
beth, No one knows better than I.
beth,What are you doing there?
thomas,Spiders.
killian,Beth...
killian,Beth... run!
beth,Don't let him get you.
thomas,Mommy...
beth,You hide now... go...
ichabod,For what it's worth...
brom,We cannot win this.
brom,There...
brom,Go to the front and guide it.
brom,Let's see him catch us now.
ichabod,Look.
brom,My Christ...
katrina,"Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move."
ichabod, What... what are you doing... ?
katrina,I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
doctor lancaster,"Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you."
ichabod,... Brom Bones...
doctor lancaster,"He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut."
ichabod,Bring Young Masbath here.
doctor lancaster,You need to sleep.
ichabod,Bring him.
doctor lancaster,You need rest.
young masbath,"Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest."
young masbath,"If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?"
ichabod,Wait...
ichabod,Panic has set in.
ichabod,"Sanctuary.  Or, so they hope."
ichabod,Do you have these persons' wills?
hardenbrook,"I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds."
ichabod,"Yes, sir... but, do you have these?"
hardenbrook,Certainly... certainly.
ichabod,"May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?"
hardenbrook,Hmm?  See them?
ichabod,May we look at them now?
ichabod,Maybe you should take this.
ichabod,Master Hardenbrook...
hardenbrook,Well... that might be... helpful.
ichabod," And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it."
ichabod,Midnight seems an appropriate time.
ichabod, They are alphabetical.
ichabod," There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  ""Paasch, James"" ""Pieter, Thomas"" ""Pos, William."""
young masbath,I was getting worried.  Who was it?
ichabod, Katrina.
ichabod,Very little.  I must be going...
ichabod,It appears well.  It has already clotted.
ichabod,"It is fine.  Now, I must..."
ichabod,What... ?
baltus,He came to me.  He promised great violence.  Said I should cast you out for my own protection.  I must speak honestly.  There is no reason to think he will not meet with success.
young masbath, What now?  Where is she?
ichabod,Wallowing in sin and lust...
katrina,"I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said."
katrina," If you think I am behind this, say it."
baltus,The Horseman is coming!
baltus,Save me...
katrina,Father?
baltus,He killed her...
baltus,The Horseman has killed her.
katrina,Father!
katrina,NO!
huge farmer,Get out!
katrina,Father...
ichabod, Here she is.
young masbath,"She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? "
ichabod, You cannot understand.
ichabod,I am sorry.  Forgive me.  I failed you.
ichabod,"Van Ripper, turn the coach about!"
van ripper,What did you say?
ichabod,Turn around.  Now!
young masbath,Hello?  Katrina?
ichabod,Pardon the intrusion...
ichabod,I never examined these bodies.
doctor lancaster,"... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed."
ichabod,"Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance."
ichabod,Stains of blood.
doctor lancaster,What of it?
ichabod,Jagged flesh.  The Horseman did not do this.
ichabod,"Here, Doctor.  Hold this just so..."
ichabod,"Open the door.  Open up, damn it!  Lady van Tassel is alive.  The Horseman is her puppet.  Please..."
huge farmer,"She's dead, and you have gone mad."
ichabod,No...
ichabod,Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
van ripper,Yes.  Here...
ichabod,Get down.  Hurry!
ichabod,Katrina!
katrina,Murderer!
young masbath,Here we are!
ichabod,Climb up!
young masbath,Lady Van Tassel...
ichabod,I know.  Hold on.
ichabod,Christ.
katrina,Where are we going?
ichabod,I do not know.  Away.
young masbath,Here he comes!
ichabod,We might make it to the church.
katrina,Masbath... !
ichabod,"Damn it, boy, get back here!"
young masbath,What can we do?
ichabod,Take the reins.
ichabod,Masbath is right.  We must do something.
katrina,Ichabod!
ichabod,Keep him off!  Block him!
ichabod,Take it!
ichabod,Go!
young masbath,What now?
ichabod,I doubt that's the end.
katrina,The church.
ichabod,He moves too fast.
katrina,What was that?
ichabod,His horse.
ichabod,There...
katrina,Ichabod...
ichabod,Keep climbing.  I will follow...
ichabod, Hopefully.
young masbath,Look out!
katrina,"Quickly, close it."
ichabod,Now!
ichabod," Oh, no..."
ichabod,Let her go!
ichabod,No!
