Speaker,Dialogue
dorothy,"She isn't coming yet, Toto. Did she hurt you? She tried to, didn't she? Come on - - we'll go tell Uncle Henry and Auntie Em. Come on, Toto."
aunt em,"Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --"
dorothy,Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
aunt em,"Dorothy, please! We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--"
dorothy,"Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --"
uncle henry,"Don't bother us now, honey -- this old incubator's gone bad, and we're likely to lose a lot of our chicks."
dorothy,"Oh -- oh, the poor little things. Oh, but Aunt Em, Miss Gulch hit Toto right over the back with a rake just because she says he gets in her garden and chases her nasty old cat every day."
aunt em,"Seventy --     Dorothy, please!"
dorothy,"Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week. And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --"
aunt em,Dorothy!     Dorothy!   We're busy!
dorothy,Oh -- all right.
uncle henry,"Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with."
aunt em,"I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry."
uncle henry,Yes.
aunt em,"Oh, I hope we got them in time."
uncle henry,Yes.
zeke,How's she coming?
hunk,Take it easy.
zeke,"Well, why don't you get your finger out of the way!"
hickory,Come on - come on - over this way.
zeke,Okay.
hickory,There you are.
hunk,Right on my finger!
zeke,It's a lucky thing it wasn't your head.
dorothy,"Zeke, what am I going to do about Miss Gulch? Just because Toto chases her old cat --"
zeke,"Listen, honey, I got them hogs to get in."
hunk,"Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch. Think you didn't have any brains at all."
dorothy,I have so got brains.
hunk,"Well, why don't you use them? When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place. Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble. See?"
dorothy,"Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all."
hunk,"Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know."
hickory,"Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her."
dorothy,"Well, gee, I try and have a heart."
hickory,"Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented."
dorothy,This?
hickory,"Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!"
dorothy,Oh!
5.,CONTINUED: 
hickory,Who did it? Now wait a minute.
dorothy,Hickory!
hickory,Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
zeke,"Say! Get in there before I make a dime bank out of you! Listen, kid, are you going to let that old Gulch heifer try and buffalo you?"
dorothy,I'm not afraid of her.
zeke,"Then the next time she squawks, walk right up to her and spit in her eye. That's what I'd do!"
dorothy,Oh!
hickory,"Are you all right, Dorothy?"
dorothy,"Yes, I'm all right.   Oh -- I fell in and - - and Zeke --"
hunk,What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
hickory,"Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --"
aunt em,"Here, here, what's all this jabber- wapping when there's work to be done? I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!"
hickory,"Well, Dorothy was walking along the --"
aunt em,"I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!"
hickory,"All right, Mrs. Gale. But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --"
aunt em,"Well, don't start posing for it now. Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers."
hunk,"Gosh, Mrs. Gale."
aunt em,Just fried.
hickory,Thanks.
hunk,Swell.
zeke,"You see, Dorothy toppled in with the big Duroc..."
aunt em,It's no place for Dorothy about a pig sty! Now you go feed those hogs before they worry themselves into anemia!
zeke,Yes'am.
dorothy,"Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto? She said she was gonna --"
aunt em,"Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing."
dorothy,No --
aunt em,"Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble."
dorothy,Some place where there isn't any trouble.
miss gulch,Mr. Gale!
uncle henry,"Howdy, Miss Gulch."
miss gulch,I want to see you and your wife right away....
uncle henry,"Dorothy?   Well, what has Dorothy done?"
miss gulch,What's she done? I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
uncle henry,You mean she bit you?
miss gulch,"No, her dog!"
uncle henry,"Oh, she bit her dog, eh?"
miss gulch,NO!
dorothy,"Destroyed? Toto? Oh, you can't!    You mustn't! Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!   You won't let her, will you?"
uncle henry,"Of course we won't. Will we, Em?"
dorothy,"Please, Aunt Em, Toto didn't mean to. He didn't know he was doing anything wrong. I'm the one that ought to be punished. I let him go in her garden. You can send me to bed without supper --"
miss gulch,"If you don't hand over that dog, I'll bring a damage suit that'll take your whole farm! There's a law protecting folks against dogs that bite!"
aunt em,"How would it be if she keeps him tied up? He's really gentle -- with gentle people, that is."
miss gulch,"Well, that's for the Sheriff to decide. Here's his order allowing me to take him. Unless you want to go against the law."
uncle henry,Uhh -- yeah --
aunt em,"Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go."
miss gulch,Now you're seeing reason.
dorothy,No --
miss gulch,Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
dorothy,"Oh, no, no! I won't let you take him! You go away, you....! Oooh, I'll bite you myself!"
aunt em,Dorothy!
dorothy,"You wicked old witch! Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto! Don't let her take him -- please!"
11.,CONTINUED: 
miss gulch,Here!   I've got an order!   Let me have...
dorothy,Stop her!
aunt em,"Put him in the basket, Henry."
miss gulch,The idea!
dorothy,"Oh, don't, Uncle Henry.   Oh, Toto! Don't..."
aunt em,"Almira Gulch, just because you own half the county doesn't mean you have the power to run the rest of us! For twenty- three years, I've been dying to tell you what I thought of you! And now -- well, being a Christian woman, I can't say it!"
dorothy,"Toto, darling! Oh, I got you back!     You came back! Oh, I'm so glad! Toto! "
12.,"CONTINUED:  Oh, they'll be coming back for you in a minute. We've got to get away! We've got to run away -- quick!"

glinda,Oh!   Well....
dorothy,"Who, Toto?"
glinda,"Well, I'm a little muddled. The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East. And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all..."
dorothy,"Oh, but I've already told you, I'm not a witch at all -- witches are old and ugly. What was that?"
glinda,"The Munchkins. They're laughing because I am a witch. I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North."

dorothy,I thought you said she was dead.
glinda,That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West. And she's worse than the other one was.
witch,Who killed my sister? Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
glinda,Leave her alone!
witch,"You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,...."
dorothy,No -- No! It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
witch,"Didn't mean it, eh? Accident, eh? Well, my little pretty, I can cause accidents, too -- and this is how I do it! GLINDA o.s."
glinda,...ting the ruby slippers?
witch,The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
glinda,It's too late! There they....
dorothy,Oh!
witch,I'm the only one that knows how to use them. They're of no use to you! Give them back to me!
glinda,"Keep tight inside of them -- their magic must be very powerful, or she wouldn't want them so badly!"
witch,"You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!"

glinda,It's all right. You can all get up.
glinda,"Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur! I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West. The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear."
dorothy,"Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas? I can't go the way I came."
glinda,No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
dorothy,The Wizard of Oz? Is he good or is he wicked?
glinda,"Oh, very good, but very mysterious. He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?"
dorothy,"No, I'm afraid I didn't."
glinda,"Well, then, you'll have to walk. The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland. And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West."
dorothy,"But, how do I start for Emerald City?"
glinda,It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
dorothy,But -- what happens if I --- CS -- Glinda speaks to Dorothy o.s. in f.g. --

scarecrow,"That way is a very nice way. CS -- Scarecrow, his arm pointing to right --"
dorothy,Who said that?
dorothy,"Don't be silly, Toto.     Scarecrows...."
dorothy,...don't talk.
scarecrow,"It's pleasant down that way, too."

dorothy,"...you did say something, didn't you? CS- The Scarecrow shakes his head, then nods - -"
dorothy,"Are you doing that on purpose, or can't you make up your mind?"

scarecrow,"Down?   No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --"
dorothy,"Oh, well, here -- let me help you."
scarecrow,"Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind."
dorothy,"Well, oh, dear -- I don't quite see...."
scarecrow,"Of course, I'm not bright about doing things, but if you'll just...."
dorothy,Oh....
dorothy,...yes.
scarecrow,Ohhhh --
dorothy,Ohh!
scarecrow,Whhhooops!     Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
dorothy,Oh -- does it hurt you?
scarecrow,"Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again."
dorothy,Ohhh --
scarecrow,"My, it's good to be...."
scarecrow,...free!
dorothy,Oh!    Oh!   Ohhh!
scarecrow,Did I scare you?
dorothy,"No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself."
scarecrow,But I didn't scare you?
dorothy,No -- of course not.
scarecrow,I didn't think so.
scarecrow,"Boo! You see, I can't even scare a crow! They come from miles.... MCU -- Dorothy listening -- SCARECROW o.s."
scarecrow,"Oh, I'm a failure, because I haven't got a brain."
dorothy,"Well, what would you do with a brain if you had one?"
40.,CONTINUED: 
scarecrow,"Do?  Why, if I had a brain, I could --  I could while away the hours, Conferrin' with the flowers, Consultin' with the rain. And my head I'd be scratchin' While my thoughts were busy hatchin' If I only had a brain. I'd unravel every riddle For any individ'le"
dorothy, With the thoughts you'll be thinkin' You could be another Lincoln If you only had a brain.
scarecrow," Oh, I could tell you why The ocean's near the shore I could think of things I never thunk before,"
scarecrow, ...Life would be a ding-a-derry If I only had a brain!
42.,CONTINUED: 
scarecrow," Gosh, it would be awful pleasin' To reason out the reason For things I can't explain. Then perhaps I'll deserve you, And be even worthy erv you If I only had a brain."
dorothy,"Wonderful! Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!"
scarecrow,They would?
dorothy,Um-hmm.
scarecrow,Where's Kansas?
dorothy,That's where I live. And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
scarecrow,You're going to see a Wizard?
dorothy,Um-hmm.
scarecrow,Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
dorothy,"I couldn't say. But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now."
scarecrow,Yes -- that's true.
dorothy,"But maybe you'd better not. I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble."
scarecrow,Witch? Huh! I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
dorothy,I don't blame you for that.
scarecrow,"But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains. Look - - I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think. Won't you take me with you?"
dorothy,"Why, of course I will!"
scarecrow,Hooray!   We're off to see a Wizard!

first tree,She....
45.,CONTINUED: 
first tree,"...was hungry! Well, how would you like to have someone come along and pick something off of you?"
dorothy,"Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas."
scarecrow,"Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples. Hmm! MCU -- First tree reacts, and speaks --"
first tree,What do you mean - she doesn't want any of those apples? Are you hinting my apples aren't what they ought to be? MCU - - Scarecrow and Dorothy --
scarecrow,"Oh, no! It's just that she doesn't like little green...."
tree,Oh....
tree,...you...
scarecrow,Go -- Go!
tree,...Oh -- Help -- let me out.   I'll give you little green....

dorothy,Oh...
tin man,Oh --
dorothy,"...Oh, did that hurt?"
tin man,No -- it feels wonderful.      I've held that axe up for ages. Oh ---
dorothy,"Oh, goodness! How did you ever get like this?"
tin man,"Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain...."
tin man,"...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid. And I've been that way ever since."
dorothy,"Well, you're perfect now."
tin man,My...my neck. My...my neck. Perfect? Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect. Go ahead -- bang on it!
dorothy,Oh --!
scarecrow,Beautiful!     What an echo!
tin man,It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
tin man,No heart.
dorothy,Oh --
tin man,All hollow. Oh --
tin man," When a man's an empty kettle, He should be on his mettle. And yet I'm torn apart. Just because I'm presumin' That I could be kind-a human, If I only had a heart."
tin man, I'd be tender -- I'd be gentle And awful sentimental Regarding Love and Art I'd be friends with sparrows...
tin man, ...And the boy who shoots the arrows If I only had a heart. Picture me....a balcony....Above a voice sings low.
tin man,"I hear a beat....how sweet! Just to register emotion Jealousy -- Devotion -- And really feel the part, I could stay young and chipper, And I'd lock it with a zipper, If I only had a heart...!"
dorothy,Oh --
dorothy,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?"
tin man,I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
dorothy,"Oh, dear -- That was wonderful! You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart."
tin man,"Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way."
scarecrow,But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
dorothy,And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
tin man,"Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?"
dorothy,"Oh, but he will! He must!   We've come such a long way already. "
tin man,Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
witch,You call that long?
witch,"Why, you've just begun! Forgotten about me,...."
witch,"Helping the little lady along, are you, my fine gentlemen?"
witch,Or I'll stuff a mattress with you!
witch,"Here, Scarecrow!   Want to play ball?"
witch,"And as for you, my little...."
witch,...happy journey back to Kansas!
scarecrow,"I'm not afraid of her. I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not! Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!"
tin man,"I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not. Bee-hive -- bah! Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?"
tin man,Oh! They're - they're gone now.
dorothy,"Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?"
tin man,"I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers."
dorothy,"Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!"
tin man,Oh - I'll get it!
dorothy,Oh! Oh!
dorothy,Oh --
tin man,"Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!"
dorothy,Oh-oh-
tin man,It's only a man without a head who could do a thing like that. Poor little bee. CU - Dorothy reacts - reaches o.s. -

tin man,Yes?
tin man,Oh.
dorothy,...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
scarecrow,"Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?"

lion,Where -- where do we go now?
scarecrow,This way!    Come on!
108.,CONTINUED: 
witch,"Well -- ring around the rosy -- a pocket full of spears! Thought you'd be pretty foxy, didn't you? Well, I'm going to start in on you right here - one after the other!"
witch,"How about a little fire, Scarecrow?"

leader,She's....she's....dead!   You've killed her!
dorothy,I -- I didn't mean to kill her....really I didn't! It's...it's just that he was on fire!
leader,Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!
winkies,Hail! Hail to Dorothy -- The Wicked Witch is dead!

all," Wake up, you sleepy head Rub your eyes"
all," She's gone where the Goblins go Below -- below -- below! Yo ho, let's open...."
all, ...up and sing
all, ...low.
112.,CONTINUED: 
all, ...witch?
all," Wake up, you sleepy head. Rub your eyes -"
oz's voice,Can I believe my eyes?    Why....
oz's voice,...have you come back?
dorothy,"Please, sir. We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West. We melted her."
oz's voice,Oh ....
oz's voice,"...you liquidated her, eh?   Very...."
oz's voice,...resourceful!
dorothy,"Yes, sir. So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir."
oz's voice,Not so fast! Not.... MLS -- Throne --
oz's voice,...so fast! I'll have to give the matter a little thought. Go away and come back tomorrow!
dorothy,"Tomorrow?    Oh, but I want to go home now."
tin man,You've had plenty of time already!
lion,Yeah!
oz's voice,Do not arouse the wrath....
oz's voice,...of the Great and Powerful Oz!   I said - - come back tomorrow!
dorothy,"If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!"
oz's voice,Do you presume to criticize the....
oz's voice,...Great Oz? You ungrateful creatures!
oz's voice,Think yourselves lucky that I'm....
oz's voice,"...giving you audience tomorrow, instead of...."
oz's voice,...twenty years from now. Oh -- oh oh! The Great Oz has spoken! Oh -- Oh --- ....
oz's voice,... Oh .... Oh ....
dorothy,Who are you?
oz's voice,Oh - I - Pay no....
oz's voice,...attention to that man behind the curtain. Go - before I lose my temper! The Great and Powerful ---....
oz's voice,... -- Oz -- has spoken!
dorothy,Who are you?
oz's voice,"Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz."
dorothy,You are?
wizard,Uhhhh -- yes...
dorothy,I don't believe you!
wizard,"No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me."
scarecrow,You humbug!
lion,Yeah!
wizard,Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.   I'm a humbug!
dorothy,Oh ....
dorothy,"...you're a very bad man! MCU -- The Wizard reacts, speaks humbly --"
wizard,"Oh, no, my dear -- I'm -- I'm a very good man. I'm just a very bad Wizard."
scarecrow,You'd better be good enough to send Dorothy back to Kansas!
wizard,"Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!"
scarecrow,It makes you nervous?
wizard,Yes.
scarecrow,What about us?
wizard,"Well, I --"
scarecrow,What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
wizard,"Well, I --"
scarecrow,-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
wizard,"Well, I --"
wizard,"Well, I-- but you've got them. You've had them all the..."
wizard,...time!
all together,"Oh, no we haven't!"
tin man,You don't get around us that easy!
lion,Not nohow!
wizard,Well --
scarecrow,You promised us real things -- a real...
scarecrow,...brain!
lion,Real courage. That's what we want.
wizard,"You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me."
wizard,"Why, anybody can have a brain. That's a very mediocre commodity. Every pusillanimous creature that crawls on the earth -- or slinks through slimy seas has a brain!"
wizard,"From the rock-bound coast of Maine to the Sun.... oh - oh, no -- -- ah - Well, be that as it may. Back where I come from we have universities, seats of great learning -- where men go to become great thinkers. And when they come out, they think deep thoughts -- and with no more brains than you have.... But! They have one thing you haven't got! A diploma!"
wizard,"Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D."
scarecrow,Th.D.?
wizard,Yeah -- that...that's Dr. of Thinkology!
scarecrow,"The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side. Oh joy, rapture! I've got a brain!"
scarecrow,How can I ever thank you enough?
wizard,"Well, you can't. As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking. You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage. You're confusing courage with wisdom. Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes. Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city. And they have no more courage than you have. But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal! Therefore -- for meritorious...."
wizard,"...conduct, extraordinary valor, conspicuous bravery against wicked witches, I award you the Triple Cross."
wizard,You are now a member of the Legion of Courage!
lion,"Oh -- Oh -- shucks, folks, I'm speechless!"
120.,CONTINUED: 
wizard,"As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart."
tin man,But I still want one.
wizard,Yes -- ....
wizard,"...back where I come from there are men who do nothing all day but good deeds. They are called phil...er -- er -- phil -- er, yes...good-deed-doers. And their hearts are no bigger than yours. But! They have one thing you haven't got! A testimonial!"
wizard,"Therefore, in consideration of your kindness, I take pleasure at this time in presenting you with a small token of our esteem and affection. And remember, my sentimental friend...."
wizard,"...that a heart is not judged by how much you love, but by how much you are loved by others."
121.,CONTINUED: 
tin man,"Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!    Listen!"
dorothy,Yes...!
dorothy,...yes.
tin man,Look -- it ticks!
lion,Read...read what my medal says.
lion,Courage!...
lion,...Ain't it the truth!    Ain't it the truth!
dorothy,Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
scarecrow,Hey -- what about Dorothy?
tin man,Yes -- how about Dorothy?
lion,Yeah.
wizard,Ah --
lion,Dorothy next!
wizard,Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor -- CU -- Dorothy --
dorothy,"Oh, I don't think there's anything in that black bag for me."
wizard,"Well, no - no -- on the contrary, on the - --- ...."
wizard,"...I -- ah -- on the contr -- -- Here -- Well, you force me into a cataclysmic decision. The only way to get Dorothy back to Kansas is for me to take her there myself! CU -- Dorothy reacts, speaks --"
dorothy,"Oh, will you? Could you? Oh -- but are you a clever enough Wizard.... MCU -- The Wizard -- DOROTHY o.s."
wizard,Child -- you cut me to the quick! I'm an old Kansas man myself...born and....
wizard,"...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair."
lion,It did?
wizard,"Yes. There was I, floating through space - - a man without a continent! CU -- Dorothy --"
dorothy,Weren't you frightened?
wizard,"Frightened? You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe. I was petrified. Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!"
dorothy,Ohhh!
wizard,"Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!"
wizard,"Good people of Oz, this is positively the finest exhibition ever to be shown -- "
124.,"CONTINUED:  -- yes -- well -- be that as it may -- I, your Wizard par ardua ad alta, am about to embark upon a hazardous and technically unexplainable journey into the outer stratosphere."
wizard,"To confer, converse, and otherwise hob- nob with my brother wizards. And I hereby decree that until what time -- if any -- that I return, the Scarecrow, by virtue of his highly superior brains, shall rule in my stead...assisted by the Tin Man, by virtue of his magnificent heart...and the Lion -- by virtue of his courage! Obey them as you would me! And - ah - well, that's all."
dorothy,"Oh, come back here!   Toto!"
dorothy,"Come back! Oh, don't go without me! I'll be right back! Toto!"
tin man,Stop that dog!
wizard,This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
tin man,Oh!    Help me! The balloon's going up!
wizard,-- Ruined my exit!
tin man,Help!
dorothy,Oh! Come back! Don't go without me! Please come back!
wizard,I can't come back!     I don't know how it works!
dorothy,Oh --
wizard,"Goodbye, folks!"
oz people,Goodbye!   Goodbye!
dorothy,"Oh, now I'll never get home!"
lion,"Stay with us, then, Dorothy. We all love you. We don't want you to go."
dorothy,"Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas. Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now. Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?"
scarecrow,Look -- here's someone who can help you!
dorothy,"Oh, will you help me?   Can you help me?"
glinda,You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
dorothy,I have?
scarecrow,Then why didn't you tell her before?
glinda,Because she wouldn't have believed me. She had to learn it for herself.
tin man,"What have you learned, Dorothy?"
dorothy,"Well, I -- I think that it -- that it wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em -- and it's that -- if I ever go looking for my heart's desire again, I won't look any further than my own backyard. Because if it isn't there, I never really lost it to begin with! Is that right?"
glinda,That's all it is!
scarecrow,But that's so easy! I should have thought of it for you.
tin man,I should have felt it in my heart.
glinda,"No. She had to find it out for herself. Now, those magic slippers will take you home in two seconds!"
dorothy,Oh....
dorothy,"...Toto, too?"
glinda,"Toto, too."
dorothy,"Oh, now?"
glinda,Whenever you wish.
dorothy,"Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye. I love you all, too. Goodbye, Tin Man. Oh, don't cry. You'll rust so dreadfully. Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye."
tin man,Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
dorothy,"Oh -- Goodbye, Lion. You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage."
lion,Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
128.,CONTINUED: 
dorothy,I think I'll miss you most of all.
glinda,Are you ready now?
dorothy,"Yes.    Say goodbye, Toto."
dorothy,"Yes, I'm ready now."
glinda,"Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times."
glinda,"And think to yourself -- ""There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."""
dorothy,There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home.
129.,CONTINUED: 
dorothy, -- there's no place like home -- there's no place like home --
dorothy,-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
aunt em,"Dorothy.   Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling."
dorothy,"Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!"
aunt em,"Yes, darling."
professor marvel,"Hello, there! Anybody home? I -- I just dropped by because I heard the little girl got caught in the big -- Well...."
uncle henry,She got quite a bump on the head -- we kinda thought there for a minute she was going to leave us.
professor,Oh --
dorothy,"But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble. And I tried to get back for days and days."
aunt em,"There, there, lie quiet now.   You just had a bad dream."
dorothy,No --
hunk,"Sure -- remember me -- your old pal, Hunk?"
hickory,And me -- Hickory?
zeke,"You couldn't forget my face, could you?"
dorothy,No. But it wasn't a dream -- it was a place. And you -- and you -- and you -- and you were there.
professor,Oh -- 
dorothy,"But you couldn't have been, could you?"
aunt em,"Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --"
dorothy,"No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place. And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice...."
dorothy,"...but most of it was beautiful. But just the same, all I kept saying to everybody was, I want to go home. And they sent me home."
dorothy,Doesn't anybody believe me?
uncle henry,"Of course we believe you, Dorothy."
dorothy,"Oh, but anyway, Toto, we're home!"
dorothy,"Home! And this is my room -- and you're all here! And I'm not going to leave here ever, ever again, because I love you all! And -- Oh, Auntie Em -- there's no place like home!"
