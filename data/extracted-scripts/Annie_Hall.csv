annie, No.
alvy,"No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing."
annie," Here, you want some?"
alvy,"No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and"
annie,Yeah?
alvy,-tried to take my pants off over my head ...  ...  my ear.
annie,What?  What?
alvy,Hey?
annie,H'm?
alvy,"I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them.  You know, instead of that cat book."
annie, that's pretty serious stuff there.
alvy,"Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think.  Big-"
annie, Yeah?
alvy,"-big subject with me, yeah."
alvy," I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable."
annie,M'hm.
alvy,Those are the two categories ...
annie,M'hm.
alvy,I don't-don't know how they get through life.  It's amazing to me.
annie,M'hm.
alvy,"You know, and the miserable is everyone else.  That's-that's all.  So-so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky ... to be ...  ... to be miserable."
annie,U-huh.
alvy,"Look, look at that guy."
annie,M'hm.
alvy,"There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third."
annie, M'hm.  Yeah.  Yeah.
annie,Yeah.
annie,"Oh! Italian, right?"
annie," Oh, yeah."
alvy,You- Do you love me?
annie,Do I love you?
alvy,That's the key question.
annie,Yeah.
alvy,I know you've only known me a short while.
alvy,"I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what..."
annie,Yeah.
alvy,- I ... I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
annie,Yeah.
annie,I dunno.
alvy,"Whatta you mean?  You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?"
annie, Of course.
alvy,"Yeah, bu-bu-but why?"
annie,"Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why."
alvy,"Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment."
annie,I have a tiny apartment.
alvy,"Yeah, I know it's small."
alvy, ... rapidly growing field.
annie,You don't want me to live with you?
alvy,"No-what, what ...? I ... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together.  Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?"
annie, How is it any different?
alvy,"Me, no.  You ... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful.  I get too, too wonderful for words.  You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love."
alvy, Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
alvy,Are yuh?
mom hall,"Now, don't let it be so long, now."
alvy,"Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know?  Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!"
alvy,"Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name.  Right?  W-What does he call you?  Bathsheba?"
alvy,You cried?  I've never once cried. Fantastic ...
annie, Yeah.
alvy,I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
annie,"In-in ... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe."
annie,"Yeah, and he's strangling me ..."
alvy,Yeah?
annie,"... and I keep, you know, it's-"
alvy,"Yeah, but you said, ""Will it change my wife""!"
annie,"No, I didn't.  I said, ""Will it change my life,"" Alvy."
alvy,"You said, ""Will it change. . ."" Wife. Will it change ..."
annie," Life.  I said, ""life."""
annie,"And, Alvy ... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough."
alvy," Why do you always bring that up?  Because I encourage you to take adult-education courses?  I think it's a wonderful thing. You meet wonderful, interesting professors'."
alvy,That's fine.  That's fine.  That's great!  Is it-is it something that I did?
alvy," Don't go any further.  Now, with your wife in bed, d-d-does she need some kind o' artificial stimulation like-like marijuana?"
young woman,Yeah.
alvy,Yeah!  So ... so h-h-how do you account for it?
young woman,Yeah.
wicked queen,I don't get a period!  I'm a cartoon character.  Can't I be upset once in a while?
female reporter,"I think there are more people here to see the Maharishi than there were to see the Dylan concert.  I covered the Dylan concert ... which gave me chills. Especially when he sang ""She takes just like a woman And she makes love just like a woman Yes, she does And she aches just like a woman But she breaks just like a little girl.""  Up to that I guess the most charismatic event I covered was Mick's Birthday when the Stones played Madison Square Garden."
reporter,The only word for this is trans-plendid. It's trans-plendid.
reporter,"He's God!  I mean, this man is God!  He's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment."
reporter,Yeah.
reporter,"It's unbelievably trans-plendid!  I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?"
alvy,"Yeah, were yuh?  I was-I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes."
reporter, I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish.
alvy, I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
reporter,"Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience."
reporter,I mean that as a compliment.
reporter,Who said that?
annie, Oh.
alvy,Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right?  What-
annie,There's a spider in the bathroom.
alvy,"That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?"
annie,"My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects."
alvy, Oooh.
annie,-I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
alvy,Kill it!  For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
annie, No.
alvy," I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over."
alvy,"Jesus.  All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything.  An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake.  Hey, what is this? What?  Did you go to a rock concert?"
annie,Yeah.
annie,It was just great!
alvy," Oh, humdinger.  When- Well, I got a wonderful idea.  Why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider.  You know, it's a-"
alvy," What is this?  What are you, since when do you read the ""National Review""? What are you turning in to?"
annie," Well, I like to try to get all points of view."
annie," Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that?  Not only that, you look thin and tired."
alvy,"Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning.  You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab.  You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs.  Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and roll star?  Is that possible?"
annie, Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
alvy,"Hey, what am I-your son?  Whatta you mean? I-I came over TV --_"
annie," I got the good chocolate, Alvy."
alvy,"Yeah, where is the spider?"
annie,It really is lovely.  It's in the bathroom.
alvy,Is he in the bathroom?
alvy," Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?"
annie, Oh.  What?
annie,Yeah?
alvy,"Two ... Yeah.  Lotta, lotta trouble. There's two of 'em."
annie,Two?
alvy," Yep.  I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider.  You got a broom or something with a-"
alvy, -snow shovel or anything or something.
annie," I think I left it there, I'm sorry."
alvy," Okay, let me have this."
annie,"Well, what are you doing ... what are you doing with-"
alvy,"Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick."
annie,"Well, okay.  Oooh."
annie, It's for my complexion.
alvy,Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  -whatta you sad about?  You- What'd you want me to do?  Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
annie," Oh, don't go, okay?  Please."
alvy," Whatta you mean, don't go?  Whatta-whatta -what's the matter?  Whatta you expecting -termites?  What's the matter?"
annie," Oh, uh, I don't know.  I miss you.  Tsch."
alvy,"Oh, Jesus, really?"
annie, Oh!  Alvy?
annie,Was there somebody in your room when I called you?
alvy,W-w-whatta you mean?
annie,I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
alvy,"Oh, I had the radio on."
annie,Yeah?
alvy,I'm sorry.  I had the television set ... I had the television-
annie,Yeah.
annie,"Alvy, let's never break up again.  I don't wanna be apart."
annie,"Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?"
alvy,"It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages.  See, 'cause. . . 'cause there's just something different about you.  I don't know what it is, but it's great."
alvy,"Tsch, why don't we get ... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood."
annie,"Okay, okay.  Okay."
alvy,That'd be fun for yuh.  Don't you think-
annie,Yeah.
annie,"-me, my God, it's a great day!"
rob," Yeah, watch the road!"
annie," Hey, you know, I never even visited Brooklyn before."
rob,I can't wait to see the old neighborhood.
alvy,"Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great."
rob,We can show her the schoolyard.
alvy,"Right.  I was a great athlete.  Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard."
annie, Holy cow!
rob,"You're lucky, Max-where I used to live is now a pornographic equipment store."
rob,"What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time."
alvy's father,You fired the cleaning woman?
alvy's mother,She was stealing.
alvy's father,But she's colored.
alvy's mother,SO?
alvy's father,So the colored have enough trouble.
alvy's mother,She was going through my pocketbook!
alvy's father,They're persecuted enough!
alvy's mother,Who's persecuting?  She stole!
alvy's father,All right-so we can afford it.
alvy's mother,How can we afford it?  On your pay? What if she steals more?
alvy's father,"She's a colored woman, from Harlem! She has no money!  She's got a right to steal from us!  After all, who is she gonna steal from if not us?"
adult alvy, You're both crazy!
rob,"They can't hear you, Max."
alvy's mother,Leo ... I married a fool!
rob," Hey, Max!  Who's that?"
alvy,"It-it-it's the welcome-home party in nineteen forty-five, for my cousin Herbie."
adult alvy, -father's friend.  He was always bothering me when I was a kid.
joey,Joey Nichols.  That's me.  Joey Five Cents!
young alvy, What an asshole!
alvy's mother,"I was always the sister with good common sense.  But Tessie was always the one with personality.  When she was younger, they all wanted to marry Tessie."
adult alvy," Do you believe that, Max?  Tessie Moskowitz had the personality.  She's the life of the ghetto, no doubt."
alvy's mother, She was once a great beauty.
tessie, I was a great beauty.
rob,"Uh, how did this personality come about?"
tessie, I was very charming.
rob,There were many men interested in you?
tessie," Oh, I was quite a lively dancer."
rob, That's pretty hard to believe.
annie,"Well, I had a really good day, you know that?  It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday."
alvy,"Yeah, but no presents till midnight."
annie," Oh, darn it."
annie, Huh?
alvy,Happy birthday.

annie,"Well, hi!"

tony,"I though it was ... very musical, and I liked it a lot."
annie,"Oh, neat ... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot."

alvy, Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
annie,Hey-
tony,It was a wonderful set.
annie, That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
alvy's psychiatrist,How often do you sleep together?
annie,"But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings.  I think you woulda been happy because ... uh, uh, I really asserted myself."
annie, Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
annie,Yeah.  Come on.  It'd be fun.
alvy,Really?  And what is the kick of it? Because I never ...
