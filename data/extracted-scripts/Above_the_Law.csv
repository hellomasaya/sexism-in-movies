Speaker,Dialogue
dissolve to:,"2   EXT. JUNGLE - DAY Blowing through the roof of a dense jungle straight AT CAMERA, HELICOPTER ROTORS RISE to a DEAFENING PITCH. SUPER:  Viet - Cambodian Border, 1972. Jungle foliage whips in the fierce downdraft as -- 3   ""HUEY"" GUNSHIP with US Army markings becomes discernible. The chopper lowers toward a crude landing zone hacked out of the wilderness. We GLIMPSE Cambodian troops and several machine gun positions around the LZ. 4   EXT. JUNGLE - TWO ARMED AMERICANS - DAY watch from the edge of the landing zone. We recognize Nico and Fox, now in their twenties, dressed in the nonmilitary jungle attire that usually marks a CIA ""spook."""
fox,You ever see chemical interrogation before?
cut to:,12   EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT
nico, Why don't you light a bonfire?
zagon,That's the nice thing about modern technology. You don't have to wait for results.
zagon," You're a hard nigger, aren't you, boy? You took it from the Chinks... you took it from the French. You'll be fucked if some Yankee peckerwood's gonna start your gums flapping -- Nico watches Zagon move the knife blade closer to the prisoner."
zagon,"-- Well, you're gonna chirp for me, tough guy. You're gonna sing like a choir --"
fox," Fox -- FOX Shut up, Nico."
zagon,"You can disappear as easy as this slope, kid --"
fox,"Are you crazy?!!  What the fuck's the matter with you?!!! Nico is shaking with rage and fear. He takes several steps away from the hooch, then draws up abruptly. Nico pulls his .45 from his holster, pops the safety, starts back for the hooch -- FOX Nico! NICO I don't cap him now, he's gonna do me later."
fox,"I'll cover this. Get back to the L.Z. --  -- I'll fix it! Get out! Get the fuck outa here! The CIT man calls out to the Cambodian troops, in dialect, pointing at Nico. The soldiers start toward Nico, as if to seize him. Fox, too, starts yelling to the troops in dialect, apparently countermanding the orders of the CIT men. The troops, confused, hold up for a moment."
fox, I'll call for a chopper... get outa here!
fade to black.,FADE IN ON:
nico,I think we got a little problem here.
jackson,"Eight more days, Lieutenant. You better start preparing your defense."
henderson,"Baby, I'm gonna put you on retainer."
lukich,"You passed the bar? I make it a point never to pass the bar. Jackson sees Nico and Sara across the yard, waves and          * starts toward them -- 39   BACK TO BRANCA AND LUIGI"
jackson,Look at this little bundle.    What a cupcake!
nico,"You give up being the D.A. and hurry up and find the right fella, Jax. You might have time for one of these yourself."
nico,"Watanabe!   Say hey, Doc."
branca,You're a father now. Are you gonna take me up on my offer?
nico,"I'm happy, Branca.    I like what I do. Branca glances seriously to the other uncles, then, with a smile, pats Nico's cheek. BRANCA Look at this face! Six-foot-four, pretty as the statue of David. And he's a cop! Branca laughs. From a distance, Watanabe watches, missing nothing. Across the porch, Lukich and several other cops observe and try to listen. BRANCA This face should be sticking up from a white shirt. It should be a banker, a businessman, someone who earns a decent living for his family! NICO We're happy. LUIGI Nickels and dimes. Your wife's a woman with class. What did she run -- a ballet school...? NICO An art gallery. BRANCA Same thing. She wants a husband who carries a briefcase, not a shoulder holster. Jackson watches Nico trying to keep his good humor. This is serious stuff, despite the light tone. Branca's eyes meet Nico's."
branca,"You wanted to get shot, you got shot. You wanted to get knifed, you got knifed. You've had your fun. Basta! Enough! UNCLE GUISEPPE Let your family help you, Nico."
nico," Uncle Gio, that kind of help I don't need. I'd rather get shot by someone I don't know. Jackson and Lukich crack up. The others follow.   For the moment, the tension is dispelled."
nico,Mrs. Z.  Is this a way to act on the day of my son's baptism? The poor woman can't meet Nico's eyes.
nico,"Listen to me, Mrs. Z. Are you listening?  I have to go to work now. But I'll come by tonight. You'll be at the bakery? MRS. ZINGARO Si, Nico. NICO We'll talk, okay? We'll find a way to take care of this."
jackson,"And then you're gonna come visit me in a nice, clean, air conditioned office --"
nico,I gotta take a quick leak. Stay put.
nico,Come on.   Show me something. No one moves.
nico,I get it.   It's a gay bar.   Is that it?
nico,"You seen the top of her head, huh? Like I seen your mother's --  She's upstairs! 4-D! Nico drags the Dude from behind the bar.     Holding him, Nico turns, glowering, to all. NICO You cocksuckers are brave enough with 14-year-old girls. 55A   INT. FLOPHOUSE HALLWAY"
nico, Get outta here. We look in the apartment.
nico," This ain't your day, kid."
pimp,"Wait, man.   It ain't like it looks --"
nico,"That's two years. He jerks the Pimp back, rips open a drawer.    More pills and glacene bags. NICO That's four.  ... I can get ya more --"
quick cutaway to:,57   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE - JACKSON
lucy,Let him alone! He's beautiful!
nico,"Not when I get through with him. Nico lifts the Pimp by the throat, pins him to the wall."
pimp,"No, man, wait! I'll give you something! Something big!"
lucy,"Please, Nico!    Don't! PIMP It's huge! I swear it! A shipment... coming in next Tuesday -- NICO Shipment, my ass. PIMP This is square! On my mother's soul! You can't send me up -- Nico glances to Lucy. Half of him wants to tear the Pimp apart, the other half doesn't want to make the poor girl's life any more tragic. Besides, he's a good cop -- and maybe this ""shipment"" is on the level. PIMP I heard it from a hooker friend of mine. She's banging some big coke lawyer, he told her. I swear to Jesus!"
pimp,I don't know.  That platinum chola... Carla DeCarlo... she knows. Nico tightens his grip on the Pimp's throat.
pimp,"She got popped this afternoon. She's downtown. Red dress, lizard shoes --"
jackson,"It's okay, girl. Mama Jax is here."
jackson," That was some leak you took. From the door of the bar, several bloodied heads peek. JACKSON Broken windows and lost pussy cats, huh. Jackson checks out her battered partner."
jackson,"You're one crazy bastard, Toscani. Nico opens the rear door, helps Jackson ease Lucy in."
nico,We'll get her some clothes and a bath. I'm not bringing her home to her grandmother like this. DISSOLVE TO:
jackson,"I don't get you, Toscani.  -- I know I'm not going to change the world. I can't stop the tonnage coming in, I can't fight the boys behind the desks pushing their buttons --"
nico,"Carla... Carla -- I just want the name of your boyfriend -- CARLA I got 200 boyfriends. The hooker, Carla DeCarlo, slaps the box away, cursing in Spanish."
carla,"Pinchi cabron, cabeza colon!"
jackson," Take it easy, sister. JACKSON I ain't your goddamn sister.   We ain't got the same mother, motherfucka. Carla fires one final parting salvo of obscenities, then sags back among the women. Carla starts to cry. Jackson comforts her; Carla responds, lets herself be comforted. CUT TO: 66   EXT. DOWNTOWN - FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY Jackson, back in her normal daytime wear, exits a building. She gets into Nico's car."
nico,"Maybe we can bust him for that. Jackson spots something, gestures subtly out window --"
jackson,That's our stud.
salvano," -- I brought you in for your muscles, Nardo, not your mouth."
nardo," I'm sorry, boss."
salvano,Your English is getting good... You're showing it off. Showing it off on the street --
nardo,I keep quiet.    I never talk no more --
nardo, I thought I was fucking dead.
chi chi,"You were right, cabron.                            *"
chi chi,We're crazy waiting for this bullshit 'shipment.' Let me waste the other fucker now.
jackson,"Toscani, you're going to have me doing time."
nico,"Lighten up, Jax. No one's bringing this into court."
jackson,"Except against us. NICO I don't give a shit how we do it. I just wanna get there. Jackson gives Nico a dirty look, but stifles her protest."
jackson,I thought you said you were gonna protect me. Cover my butt. Be my guardian angel -- Nico hears something through the earphones.    Gestures for silence -- 80   ANGLE THROUGH OFFICE WINDOW Chi Chi listens with increased intensity to something on the phone. He starts writing it down -- 81   BACK TO NICO In unmarked car.   He's writing it down too. NICO I got the shipment.                                  * JACKSON What?    What's he saying?
nico," '... Engine block has cleared customs. Serial number VA-748. Pick up Tuesday, 3 May as authorized.'"
jackson,Salvano? NICO Jackpot.
hostess,Two for dinner?
nico,"Two for drinks. They elbow up to the packed bar, standing.   Nico squints toward the rear dining room."
nico,"Cheer up, partner.   I'm gonna make you famous."
jackson,"You missed a few spots, boys. LUKICH I'm takin' it home t'a make kilbasa, boss."
lukich,"This ain't a bust -- it's a convention. NICO Don't you like company, Luke?  That's enough, all of you! Keep this channel clear."
nico, You stay put.                                       *
nico," It's going down now. Move! 103   EXT. REAR OF PACKING PLANT - DAY The station wagon men heave their rear door open, the van men start to open their side door. The Lincoln is stopped at a distance. Suddenly -- 104   NICO AND LUKICH burst from the rear door of the packing plant, guns drawn. LUKICH Police! 105   QUICK CUTS - VAN AND STATION WAGON MEN grab for their weapons --"
nico," How many kilos you got in there, Skivuzo? Salvano couldn't answer if he wanted to. The other cops look at Nico with awe. Lukich whips the van door open, yanks a tarp off the cargo. 123   INT. VAN The engine block sits in a wooden shipping frame, wrapped with industrial plastic. Nico climbs into the van, rips the plastic sheeting off, grabs the wood slats of the shipping frame, tears them off. In the background, ambulances are arriving to care for the wounded cops and criminals."
nico,What kinda fuckin' high is this? CUT TO:
salvano,-- I'll tell you what this cop is. He's a fucking menace!
agent halloran,"Your problem is being handled right now, Mr. Salv -- SALVANO Yeah? Well, it shoulda been handled twelve hours ago. I don't know who's running this outfit, but somebody better get his goddamn wires straight! AGENT NEELEY                           *  -- count on it, sir. Right. You'll have our full cooperation. Neeley hangs up. Glances dubiously to Halloran. Then turns     * grimly to Salvano, Chi Chi and the lawyer Abandano."
lieutenant strozah,The tapes too.
nico, That's my Lawrence Welk collection!
lieutenant strozah,"I want everything you got on this one. Reluctantly, Nico hands over the tapes.   The Lieutenant eyes the bugs and wires. LIEUTENANT STROZAH I know you don't give a shit about yourself, Toscani.  But you're gonna put Jackson's ass in a sling, too, with these illegal wires."
jackson,Bad bad.
jackson,Is that enough? Can we do something normal now -- like eat lunch?
nico,"Anything you say, Jax.   How about Salvano's?"
jackson,"Let it be, Nico."
jackson,"What... you kept his tape, too? Nico already has it in the PLAYER. We hear FRAGMENTS of the telephone tap from the body shop in Spanish and English. Jackson looks frustrated. Nico listens care- fully to what appears to be the taped PHONE CONVERSATION. NICO Poetry, ain't it? 140   EXT. REAR SALVANO'S RESTAURANT - DAY "
jackson,"This is your mother's church, isn't it?"
nico,Yeah. But I bet she's never seen these boys in the choir. 150    NICO'S POV
nico,"Father Genarro. The priest seizes Nico's hand warmly, smiles at Jackson."
father genarro,This must be your partner in crime.  It's good you stopped by. I have to show you something. Please. The priest begins leading Nico and Jackson. Jackson keeps glancing back out the alley to see Salvano's car slowly driving by. 153   INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY
father genarro,The rats are getting bigger. NICO When did this happen?
father genarro,Two nights ago. I didn't call the police.
father genarro," It's all right, son. These are friends."
father tomassino,"How do you do? Nico shakes the young priest's hand. There is a moment between them as Nico meets Tomassino's eyes, liking what he sees. The refugees are relieved, however, when Father Genarro, Nico and Jackson take their leave. 155   NICO, JACKSON AND FATHER GENARRO"
father genarro,Too long. At least the kids can go to our school.
nico,"Who did it, Father?"
father genarro,"Kids, maybe.  Maybe worse. It's not the first time. JACKSON We can have a car check by, every hour."
father genarro,No... please.    Police frighten these people.
father genarro,"Tell me, Nico... When was your last confession?"
nico,"I'm a married man, Father.   I've got no sins to confess."
father genarro,"You're a police officer, you have many sins to confess. JACKSON Amen. Nico and Jackson start off."
rosa,Father Genarro! I have you to thank for getting my son back into church!
father genarro,It's amazing what shame can accomplish.

machete man," No, hermano. Please --"
nico,Who put up the money? MACHETE MAN What money?
machete man,"I told ya!    No one! Nico slams him with a fierce shot to the ribs. The hood doubles over, gasping. The flower girls shriek even louder. Nico turns to the girls with a ferocious glare. NICO  Shut up! The girls instantly go silent in terror. Nico turns back to Machete Man, spins him violently face-down, jacking the punk's right arm straight out behind him. We see that Nico can break his elbow with one blow. NICO Give it to me! Nico raises his fist to strike."
machete man,"Jimmy Constanza! Nico shoves the hood into the ground, tearing the hood's wallet from his trouser pocket. Nico rips the wallet a- part, seizes the kid's identification and holds it up. He grabs the punk by the hair with his free hand. Machete Man is staring up in terror, wondering what this means."
nico,"If you're lying to me, I'll come and kill you right in your own fucking kitchen."
nico,"Gracias, muchacho. Nico walks away."
nico,Of course I will. I've been waiting to hear from Jax. She was supposed to get back to me by now.
nico," This better be good, Jax."
nico," Long time, Nelson."
nico,He just wanted to make sure we got his Christmas card.
rosa, Check that coat.

jackson," I've been at the Tribune all night, wearing out their Xerox machine. Harrison's staff has been compiling some kind of white paper. He's due to release it next week. Nico's mind races."

nico,"Stay with 'em. We'll be there. LUKICH What's going on, Nico?   What happened? NICO I got a call last night. An old agency friend. He told me my family was in danger. Jax and Lukich can't put all the pieces together yet.    But if it's drugs-CIA-Senate, it's got to be heavy. LUKICH You got a weapon? Lukich knows he doesn't. He glances up and down the street, makes sure no one's watching -- then cracks the driver's door of his car. There's a bulge in the map pocket. Nico  pulls out a Sig Saur .45. LUKICH Try this on.

fox,I figured you'd do your recon from this building.
fox,Getting a bit of a tire. NICO  Your own tailor? FOX Hong Kong.
nico,"You've gone a long way. Fox motions for Nico to dump his gun; Nico complies, dropping it gently into the briefcase. Nico takes half a step toward Fox. Fox shakes his head in warning."
fox,"Uh uh.  Uhhh-uh...  I know what you can do when you get too close to a man. 367    CLOSEUP - NICO                                                  * NICO                                    * I don't believe you, Fox.                             * 367A   INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                  *"
fox,"If I wanted to cap you, I'd have saved myself this chit-chat. Make big points for me to bring in your scalp. I'd be White House material. NICO Is that what Zagon is?    One of your basement boys?"
fox,Zagon's a rancher. 4000 acres in Costa Rica. Beautiful place.
nico,Bought with what -- opium from Cambodia?
fox,And a ton a week of coke from other places. NICO Which he funnels here through Salvano. With the Company getting its cut. FOX Legal tender.
nico,"Still dodging appropriations committees, eh, Nelson?"
fox,"That's my job, Nico. They arrive at an elevator. FOX Keep your nose in the corner. When we get out, stay five paces ahead of me. Cross down to the garage. 367B   INT. LOWER CORRIDOR Nico and Fox emerge from the elevator. Nico lowers his hands from behind his head. Fox keeps his gun out of sight as he and Nico step past. 368    ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT"
nico,"The Senator couldn't be bought, could he? He was gonna blow the lid off, so you cleared Zagon to frost him --"
fox,Keep walking.
nico,But the priest found out somehow and ran here. You couldn't do the Senator's number 'till you knew if the priest had talked. So Zagon flew in with his little medical bag. Only by then I was in on it -- and you thought I might recognize his handiwork.
fox,"I tried to warn you, old buddy. I knew you had wiretaps. and I knew you wouldn't let 'em go. NICO Only I was too dumb to crack it. I was so busy trying to figure a code, I didn't even recognize Zagon's voice. It's all crystal clear to Nico now. NICO So we kill our own senators now. FOX Why not?   The Romans did."
nico, Are we the Romans?
fox,We're an empire too.
fox,"Would you rather spoon borscht and quote Lenin?  I'm trying to save you, asshole! I got a spot for you. Thailand, deep under, no names, no numbers --"
nico,Doing what -- processing heroin?
fox,"You 'consult.' You 'assist.' You send checks to your family. Zagon won't touch you, you'll be on the team --"
nico,"Fuck you. FOX In five years you're out, with a fat Swiss account and a GS-15 pension. Nico stares at his old friend with contempt. He sees the gun under Fox's coat, but he's too tired and too disgusted to care --"
nico,"You know, Fox, right now in Israel they're trying some 80-year-old camp guard for war crimes. And all around our country there are guys on Death Row for killing one person, two people. And probably they all deserve it -- He takes a step toward Fox.   Fox's hand tightens on his gun. NICO  Viet. Lao. Thai. Cambodian. Librarians, teachers, doctors... women, children... and that's just a sliver of it. Fox tries to maintain a hard face.   But his own guilty conscience is working --"
nico, We've wiped out entire fucking countries. And not one agent --
fox, Stop right there!
nico," WILL BE MODIFIED TO CONFORM TO LOCATION. DO NOT BUILD OR PURCHASE WITHOUT CHECKING WITH STUNT COORDINATOR AND ASSISTANT DIRECTORS. STORYBOARDS AND NEW PAGES WILL BE AVAILABLE NEXT WEEK. 371   A BIG CAR                                                      * SCREECHES to a halt in front of them. Five men dismount        * swiftly. Salvano, Bad Dude, and two agent types from the       * tenement... and Zagon!                                         * Zagon and his men are forty feet from Nico and Fox, playing it cool so as not to alarm any innocent bystanders, but the bulk under their jackets is unmistakably guns."
nico,"Well... well.    What a team we have here. ZAGON  We've been looking for you, Nelson.    I see you've found our friend."
nico,"Thanks for the help, Fox."
fox,"I didn't bring him, Nico.    I swear it! ZAGON Have you two been sharing fond memories? Reminiscing about the good old days?"
fox,Stay still!  Don't fucking move!!
zagon,"Bring in our friend, Nelson. Salvano's muzzle covers Fox and Nico --"
zagon,Be a good boy -- 372   FOX
zagon,"We've got an hour before the honorable senator.  You've got to learn to take time, smell the roses."
zagon,I've used these little beauties many times to extract information --  -- This'll be the first time I've ever used them... just for fun.
zagon,"Hold him up! Pistol agent and Bad Dude lift Nico. Zagon slams him again. Again. Nico's cheekbone is broken; blood drains from his nose. Zagon aims a two-handed blow; backhands Nico, crushing the other side of his face! Zagon backs off, chest heaving. Pistol agent and Bad Dude plop Nico back in the chair, gagging, choked by the noose. Nico looks like the Viet prisoner -- the one we saw in the opening sequence. Like the prisoner, Nico takes his beating -- still conscious, still meeting Zagon's eyes with defiance."
zagon,"This is where you came in, Toscani. Only, now it's where you're gonna check out. He takes off his glove, grabs the syringe. Pistol agent and Bad Dude clamp Nico's right arm down tight. Zagon injects Nico."
zagon,Fight it. Till the vessels burst in your brain. Till the arteries rupture in your heart --
zagon,"That's my boy. That's what I was waiting for -- Zagon produces his famous knife. He motions Pistol agent and Bad Dude to release Nico's arms. Noose agent slackens his grip on the choke cable. Zagon moves in closer, gloating, cooing --"
zagon,"A fool learns from his own mistakes. But a wise man learns from the mistakes of others --  You should have killed me when you had the chance, Toscani --"
lukich, Is there a hotel doctor?    Call 911!
fade out.,FADE IN ON:
senator harrison,Detective Toscani. I wanted to personally thank you. You are making it possible for a sliver of truth to finally come out.
senator harrison,"And this is Clayton Alspaugh of the fifth circuit court. NICO Your Honor. The Judge nods to his stenographer, who swiftly sets up her equipment, takes a seat. Rosa makes a face at Branca, who rises, clearing a seat for the Judge. Sara moves              * in tight beside Nico. JUDGE ALSPAUGH Are you sure you're feeling well enough?
