bertha mae,You can drink your liquor You can drink your cold can beer-
slick,"She sounding good, huh?"
ty,Sounds fine.   Always has.
bertha mae,You can drink your good whiskey You can drink your cold can beer-
slick,Not much of a crowd.
ty,Not a crowd at all. Just some stiffs who want to drink theirself to sleep without the music wakin em up.
slick,You ought to advertise. Got an attraction like Bertha Mae-
bertha mae,You can lay up with your sweet gal But Poppa don't you leave me here
ty,"Singin is one thing, Slick. Whether people want to look at you while you do it is another."

stokely,You know why Slick here is like a preacher?
stokely,Cause he does all his best work on his knees.
maceo,"Never mind him, he just a drunk-"
stokely,I hear she put a ring through it and use it to yank him around the house.
maceo,"You know Tyrone don't allow no scufflin here, Slick."
stokely,"I oughta get me a old woman too, take care of the groceries. Just got to sweet-talk her some, give her a good poke now and then-"
maceo,"You gonna drink, Stokely, or you gonna lay out back recoverin from that busted head you about to get?"
delilah,Gentlemen-
slick,    Miss Delilah-
delilah,Let's behave ourselves.  What are you boys doing in here? Out!
delilah,And what are you doing behind that bar?
china doll,It's just for a minute.
delilah,"That's sixty seconds too long. Maceo, you get back there and take that child's place."
delilah,You bring people their food. Don't you be messing with their liquor.
china doll,Nobody's eating.
delilah,"That's cause nobody's here but these couple lost souls, haven't had an appetite since they give over to the devil."

ty,Not much chance of that in here.  Harvest hands all been crowdin into Toussaint's place. The young ones.
delilah,You'll get some of them.
ty,"They stick their noses in here, get one little sniff of the music, and they gone."
delilah,   Maybe that's the wages of sin.

delilah,Viola Underwood found the Lord.
ty,I thought she found Him last year when they come through.
delilah," Well, she must have lost Him again between then and now, cause she come down that aisle tonight hollering in tongues."
ty,"The Spirit didn't move you, though?"
delilah, Not yet.   Might be too late for me.
delilah,I can't believe you're serving Alton Stokely.
stokely, Stokely has to use two hands to keeps his glass steady as he drinks-  DELILAH  Toussaint cut his credit off. Either he gets it here-
ty,-or he drinks that paint-peeler Willie Pettigrew cooks up back in the swamp.
delilah,He's gonna drink himself to death in here.

possum,"Old Toussaint, owns the Ace of Spades, don't feature live music. And Pinetop Purvis, owns the Honeydripper Lounge? He don't care bout no guitar. Won't have one under his roof."
sonny,That don't make sense.

china doll,"Miss Nadine makes some good money too, sewing for people."

maceo,"Well, come four, five months, a man starts to- sorry, China Doll, but this just the way it is- a man gots needs."
ty,"Nadine look like she can take care of those, too-"
maceo,"You eat chicken every morning, noon and night for five months, you get a taste for some different kind of meat, right?  Maybe I shouldn't be-"
china doll,Aint gonna tell me something I haven't heard worse.
maceo,"Well, Nappy goes out and has him a- a porkchop or two, let's say- and he comes back from Toussaint's one night feeling no pain, smelling like- like porkchops- the way a man will- and he falls out on Nadine's couch and commences to snore. Wake up the next mornin, finds she had took all his clothes off without him knowin it-"
ty,Man was dog drunk-
maceo,"Miss Nadine come in with a skillet in her hand, hot grits bubbling in it, says ""Baby, I got your breakfast."" ""Not this morning, Nadine,"" he says, sittin up, ""don't think I could eat a thing."" ""Well then,"" she says, ""we can't let this go to waste, can we?"" and she dump that whole hot bubblin mess right in the man's lap."
ty,    Owwww!
maceo,"Then she got busy with that hot iron on his head. Screams didn't bring the neighbors in, she would of killed that man."
ty,"You got to admit it, though- woman is an artist with that Singer machine."

cool breeze,Lucky got a better offer.
ty,He can't do that.
cool breeze,You don't think so?
maceo, What if we got our payment for him Monday?
cool breeze,Saturday night.
maceo,We can do that-
cool breeze,Not just a taste- the whole two hundred.
ty,And I throw in a twenny-five cent tip for his messenger boy.
cool breeze,I'll be here.
ty,"In the meantime, we not open yet. Which means yall are trespassin."
cool breeze,"You seen enough, Mr. Simmons?"
cool breeze,"Yeah, somebody could make something out of this place. Wouldn't take much work at all."
ty,We cleared over two hundred that one weekend-
maceo,Couple years back-
ty,And we didn't have no Louisiana guitar wizard playin neither.
maceo,"Yeah, they say he draws em like flies."
ty,That's what they say.
maceo,"They say first thing he does is go to the man that owns the joint, sticks out his hand and wants that cash money put in it."
ty,I already sent fifty to his manager.

amanda,"Of course you won't join me, you don't partake. That was thoughtless of me."
delilah,That's all right.
amanda,So you don't take spirits and- what else? In your church?
delilah,"I'm sort of between churches right now. I been thinking about changing over to the Holiness, but I- I haven't been sanctified yet."
amanda,Ah-
delilah,There's been a minister in this week-
amanda,The tent out by the fairgrounds.
amanda,"The church I grew up in- we were Pentacostals- they wouldn't have anything but the human voice inside the church. And dancing- any kind of dancing, music, card playing-- well, it was very strict. They took up serpents."
delilah,I've heard of that.
amanda,"I tell Floyd these stories and he's horrified. They've always been Methodists, Floyd's family."
delilah,They're good people too.
amanda,"When I married Floyd-- oh, it was quite a scandal among my relatives. As if I'd taken up with somebody in a cult."
delilah,"It can be a trial, married folks differ in their religion."
amanda,And your husband is a--- ?
delilah,Unaffiliated.
amanda,Unaffiliated. I see.    He has his-- social club-
delilah,The Honeydripper.
amanda,Such a colorful name.
delilah,Yes.
amanda,He must devote a great deal of his energy to it.
delilah,"It's just him and Maceo Green runs it, and then I go over and cook some when I get off here."
amanda,That's very- supportive of you. Considering the sort of- environment-
delilah," I been in those barrooms most of my life, Miss Amanda."
amanda,I see-
delilah,"I was a singer. I met Tyrone in the Paradise, down in Shreveport, China Doll was only two-"
delilah,"I was just kind of livin along, you know, drinking more than I ought-- then Tyrone. It was like a light come into my life."
delilah,"People think things because he owns the Lounge, but they don't know him."
amanda,Small minds are never in short supply.
amanda,The people in this town---
amanda,"I suppose they expected that Floyd, being from a prominent family- as prominent as is possible here in Harmony- would have chosen somebody more--"
amanda,"My people were very devout, but they weren't- financially successful."
delilah,No shame in that.
amanda,"In school, if you didn't have shoes-"
amanda,"Oh, I forgot--"
amanda,"I was going through Emily's old things the other day, and I thought this would look just darling on your China Doll-"
delilah,"Oh- I don't think it would near fit her, Miss Amanda."
amanda, How old is she now?
delilah,Seventeen.
amanda, Oh my- I must have lost track somewhere along the line. Seventeen.
delilah,It was a very nice thought.
china doll,Mama?   They need you at-
china doll,"Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Amanda.   I didn't know you was home."
amanda, China Doll! We were just recalling-    you used to play right here under this table.
slick,"There isn't any cash money I know of. She sold a good deal of the furniture, but there's still a nice- lookin sofa in the parlor. Only thing she cared for anymore was singin out to Pinetop's place-"
slick,You welcome to look around the house- if there's anything your Missus might like-- long as it's not something personal to me and Bertha Mae-
slick,"It's just- she got to go out in style, is what it is. The best you got, all the trimmins- lay it out for her. That's the way she lived it- that's the way she ought to leave it."

sonny,Lay it out for me.
ned,"Not my rhythm- your rhythm. That's between you and the day and the work you got before you. Once you on it, don't let nothin and nobody push you off it."

reverend cutlip,"The Highway of Life, Brothers and Sisters, will twist you and turn you, it will run you this way and that way, it will tempt you with many a detour-- for the Highway of Life, Brothers and Sisters, is designed to lead us astray!"
reverend cutlip,"It meanders away from the Light and into the Darkness, it tires our legs and whittles away at our spirits!"
reverend cutlip,"It snares us with the thorns and thistles of wickedness, it is paved with the black deeds of sinners and laid out on a crooked plan! That's not the road we want to be on, Brothers and Sisters, that's not the path we need to follow!"
reverend cutlip,We got to get on that other road! The one that leads to salvation! The one that leads to glory! The one that leads to the right hand of God! Praise His name!
congregation,Praise the Lord!
reverend cutlip,"The thoroughfare I'm talking about, the righteous path we got to tread, is called the Highway to Heaven, and by the great Lord above it is straight and it is narrow!  Keep your eyes on the prize and your feet on the street and you won't ever make a mis-step, you won't ever falter, you won't ever stumble, because Jesus will show you the Way!"
reverend cutlip,"But you got to pay attention to who it is walking beside you, Brothers and Sisters, got to be wary against those who will hold you back from your journey! There's many a loved one got to be left behind! Cause you either on the road or you lost in the wilderness!"
delilah," We TIGHTEN on Delilah as she listens, upset, taking this all very personally-  REVEREND CUTLIP  You either headed for glory or doomed to damnation! You either in with the Lord or you in with the Devil- and they aint no in-between!"

maceo,Man don't take care of hisself- out drinkin and jazzin the women every night-
ty,Don't make any difference now.
maceo,"Got so bad, I heard there was some ole boy goes around pretendin to be Guitar Sam, fill out the gigs he misses. Does pretty well for hisself, what I hear-"
ty,Somebody we could find?
maceo," Hell, I don't know.     Just a story I heard."
ty,There must have been a first one.
maceo,First what?
ty,"Back slavery days, they had the ones that worked in the big house. Might not of had shoes always, but their pants didn't have no holes and they didn't pick no cotton."
maceo,House niggers.
ty,"That's how they called em. They must of had all their African kinda instruments- drums, shakers, some kind of banjo thing- but the piano-"
maceo,Didn't bring no piano over on them ships from Africa.
ty,"The piano was just sittin there in the white folks' big room, all polished up-- and I figure this one boy, he goes past fifteen, twenty times a day, running the corner of his eye over it. And he's there when they play, the masters, doin all their minuets and whatever-"
ty,"-him standing there with a tray of white people food pretendin not to have a thought in his head, might be only some dust hangin in the air for all they know- but he's watchin the fingers, see, watchin them keys work. This old boy, the first one, he can play alla them Africa kinda instruments, he can play mud if you give him the key and the tempo, he's got music in his head, in his heart, in every damn piece of him there's music."
maceo,Down to the bones--
ty,"And one day the masters is away, huntin foxes or some rich white people thing they get up to, and he's alone in the room with that piano and he comes over and sits down on the bench-"
maceo,Watch out now-
ty,-and he spreads his fingers out the way he seen the minuet player do- and he-
ty,"And he thinks- `Lord help me, I could do some damage with this.'"
maceo,"Would have liked to been there. I mean to hear the cat play, not none of the rest of it."
ty,"Mace, Imonna lose my club."
maceo,"Old Man Toussaint finds out you stole his liquor, you like to lose more than that-"
ty,I got no more cards to play-
maceo,"Maybe if you was to go down, see Lucky Hardaway in person-"
ty," I aint kissin up to no cokey-nose, conk-headed-"
ty,What the hell that sposed to be?
maceo,Some kind of guitar.
ty,"A guitar has got a hole in it, that's where the sound comes from. That boy must be bout three bricks shy of a load upstairs."
china doll,They gone and arrest him!
ty,Arrested who?
china doll,Sonny. The high Sheriff arrested him and sold him over to Judge Gatlin.
ty,Who's Sonny?
china doll,Sonny that was here yesterday morning.
ty,"Sonny that got a screw loose is why they arrested him. Maceo, make a noise on that-"
maceo,It's electric-
ty,I plug a chunk of stove wood into the wall I get more music out of it than that mess gonna make.
maceo,"Naw, man, it don't work unless it's hooked up to the juice, see? You got the juice, you don't need the hollow inside the box, the music just runs straight from the strings through this wire and comes out-"
maceo,-your amplifier. Which is what this thing must be.
china doll,Sonny said he fix radios in the Army.
ty,"Sonny didn't do nothin but feed bedbugs in anybody's Army, and some of em crawled in his head. Surprised if that boy got the wit to pick cotton. Judge Gatlin bought himself a droolin idiot. What you want to amplify a damn guitar for anyway?"
china doll,Daddy-
ty,Less you gonna sit over on your chair and play them little Charley Christian kind of riffs-
maceo,A sideman-
ty,"Sit over there and be all clean and polite. Guitar hasn't been up front since them old piss and moan blues shouters, sit their blind asses on the corner hollerin for pennies-"
maceo,Old time music-
china doll,"Daddy, Sonny didn't do nothin to be arrested for! He was just lookin for work."
maceo,"They hung colored boys for less than that, darlin. Least on the work gang they feed em, keep their strength up."
china doll,But he doesn't belong there!
maceo,"You know, Guitar Sam plays him an electric, but I don't think it's this no-hole kind of deal."
ty,"I hope he plugs it in the wrong socket some night, lectrocutes his sorry no-show ass!"
ty, Now if he did show up here-- and our power was to go out again while he was playing-
ty,So he come out and plugs his ax in-
maceo,"He come out lookin good, from what I hear. All kind of spangly pants and jacket, got his name spelled out on the back-"
ty,"Clothes, right-"
maceo,"Hair all slick and shiny, flash some gold teeth at them gals, got his sax man behind him, maybe a piano, harmonica, drums-"
ty,You remember that night the lights went out in the Esquire Club in Mobile?
maceo, And somebody took off with the gate? Stole the whole damn register off the counter-
ty,"They didn't hold it against Reggie Porter, did they?"
maceo,Naw- it was his place that got robbed.
ty,"Didn't hold it against him, didn't expect no money back for the show-"
maceo,They all too busy diving on the pot of that tonk game got interrupted-
ty,"And nobody suspected it might be Reggie Porter hisself that pulled them lights, did they?"
maceo,"Aw, no, Ty, we can't-"
ty,"China Doll, you mind the place while we're gone!  Come on, man, we got work to do."
china doll,"Where you going, Daddy?"
ty,"I promise the people Guitar Sam, they gonna get Guitar Sam!"

sheriff pugh,You'd rather eat roofin nails than come to me for a favor-
ty,It's not a favor if I got to pay-
sheriff pugh,"Oh, you gonna pay all right. You don't hand me that money Sunday mornin, you got yourself a new partner. Same deal as I got with Toussaint. How'd that be?"

sonny,"I know ever one of Guitar Sam's songs- know the chords, know the words-"
ty,That's fine.
sonny,China Doll said how you was famous once.

sonny,How'd you get your start?
ty,"Down in Mobile there was an old cathouse professor name of Joe Dudlow, had had a stroke on one side, curled him all up- but he kept on pluggin. I used to come out and play his left hand for him."

ty," There was a meanness hanging over them juke joints, there was murder in the air. You stopped playin for a minute, it come down like a flock of crows."
sonny,This is you-
ty,"Big band days, on the road. If a railroad train run through it, we played it."
sonny, `Reginald Erskine'. Don't believe I ever heard of him-
ty,"Big tall light-skin fella out of Carolina, said he's part Cherokee. Couldn't play nothin, but he waved his little stick and had this long greasy hair he throw around like Cab Calloway."
sonny,And you were the piano man.
ty,"Piano man, arranger, you name it."
sonny,"That must of been somethin, see the country first class."
ty,"I don't know about first class, but we seen the country."
sonny,How come you stopped?
ty, Got tired of carrying another man's water. Didn't want to die in no colored hotel some night in Who-Knows-Where Arkansas.
ty,Met Delilah and wanted something of my own.
sonny,"Well you don't have nothing to worry about, Mr. Pinetop. I won't let you down tonight."
ty,No-   I don't spose you will.
delilah,-and you got no business puttin your fingers on it!
ty,"China Doll don't need any school, baby, she could walk into one of them shops right this minute and get a job!"
delilah,"There's got to be some line you won't cross, some thing you won't do-"
ty,"The world starts throwin me breaks, woman, maybe I'll catch religion and walk the straight and narrow like them Bible thumpers you sit up with, but till that day, I-"
delilah,"Reverend Cutlip is right about you!  WHAM! Delilah slams the back door as she storms out. Ty turns and CRACK! kicks an empty crate halfway across the floor before stomping out to the bar. Maceo opens a beer with the church-key hanging from the icebox handle, takes a gulp and sits to ponder this new development-"
choir,You got to kneel Got to kneel for the Savior and pray You got to kneel Got to kneel for the Savior and pray
maceo,Natives gettin restless.

maceo,"I got a baseball bat under the counter, but you out here all alone-"
ty,"Just get the liquor movin, Mace, and keep that money where you can run with it."
reverend cutlip,The Lord don't want nobody to sit back suffering! He wants you to stand up! He wants you to rise up! He wants you to step forward! He wants you rush down into the merciful arms of His eternal salvation!
reverend cutlip,Is there anyone out here tonight gonna answer His call? Is there anyone out here tonight gonna come forward and be saved?
reverend cutlip,"The fire is heatin up, Brothers and Sisters, and Judgement Day is nigh! Aint no time to hesitate, you got to come on down and take Him into your heart!"
reverend cutlip,That's right- come on down! They no turning back now- feel the Lord's hand at your back- got to leave all them sinners behind!
reverend cutlip," You got a voice in your heart, Sister- that's the Lord talking! You hear him?"
reverend cutlip,That voice telling you where you need to be right now! You just got to move your feet and get there!
china doll,You look good.

china doll,"He looks good, doesn't he Daddy?"
ty,"Honey, I want you to get right by that front door and take over collectin the cover charge. And if anything should happen- like go wrong or something- you just step out and walk away from the club, hear?"
china doll,What's gonna go wrong?
ty,"Oh- our Guitar Sam here gets them soldier boys jumping it could get a little rough- just be on your toes, that's all."
china doll,Okay.
