Speaker,Dialogue
fade in," 1    MAN'S FOOTPRINT  on the moon.  EXT. MOON  Camera begins to pull back slowly, straight up - the song ""Moon Shadow"" by Cat Stevens begins.  Once we are high enough to see the entire moon, the main title is superimposed.  An American Werewolf in London  We continue to retreat from the moon, looking on as it grows farther from us, continuing credits until the full moon is the size it appears to us from earth.  2    EXT. CROSSROADS ON THE MOORS - NIGHT  Tree branches enter into the frame, the camera pans down and we see a truck approaching.  We are at a crossroads in the moors, looking sinister enough to have earned their literary reputation.  The truck stops at the crossroads, the DRIVER, mustached and wearing tweeds, boots, and a muffler, climbs down.  ""Moon Shadow"" ends."
truck driver,"Here, lads, East Proctor and all about are the moors.  I go east here."
jack,"Yes, well thank you very much for the ride, sir.  You have lovely sheep."
truck driver," Boys, keep off the moors. Stay on the road.  Good luck to you."
david,Thanks again!
jack,Are you cold?
david,Yes.
jack,Good.
david,Jack.
jack,David.
david,You're not having a good time are you?
jack,"Oh, I don't know.  I mean look around.  Isn't this a fun place?"
david,"Well, I like it here."
jack,"I'm sorry.  Northern England first, Italy later."
david,Right.
david,I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
jack,Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
david,She's a jerk.
jack,You're talking about the woman I love.
david,"I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break."
jack,"Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?"
david,I don't know.
jack, Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe!  See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit!  See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican!  Never has the screen dared....
david,"If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you."
jack,I have to make love to her. It's very simple.  She has no choice really.
david,It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
jack,It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
david,"We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade?  How many years of foreplay is that?"
jack,She says she `likes me too much'.
dissolve,TO:
jack,The Slaughtered Lamb?
david,"Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb.  Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?"
jack,That's a wolf's head.
david,"Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb.  Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?"
jack,That's not a spear.  It's a pike.
david,A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
jack,"David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault."
david,I assume full responsibility.
jack,Okay.
david,Shall we?
david,Hello.
jack,Nice to see you.
david, It's very cold outside.  May we come in?
jack,Do you have any hot soup?
woman,No.
david,"Well, do you have any coffee?"
woman,No.
jack,"Hot chocolate? WOMAN We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea."
jack,Then you have some hot tea?
woman,No.
jack,Oh.
woman,But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
jack,Nice looking group.
david,"Listen, at least it's warm in here."
jack,Look at that.
david,What about it?
jack,It's a five-pointed star.
david,Maybe the owners are from Texas.
jack, Remember the Alamo?
woman,I beg your pardon?
david,He was joking.  Thank you.
woman,"Joking?  I remember The Alamo. I saw it once in London, in Leicester Square."
chess player,"She means in the cinema, that film with John Wayne.  Checkmate."
david,"Oh, yes, of course."
jack,"Right, with Laurence Harvey and everybody died in it.  It was very bloody."
chess player,Bloody awful if you ask me!
chess player,"Here, Gladys, Tom.  Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?"
woman,"No, but we're about to."
chess player,"You be quiet, woman, and let me speak."
woman," Quiet, everyone!  Hush!  Shhh!"
chess player,"All right, laugh then.  I shan't tell it."
woman,"Oh, come on, tell us."
chess player,No.  You've had your chance.
jack, Ask them what the candles are for.
david, You ask them.
jack," Listen, that's a pentangle, a five-pointed star.  It's used in witchcraft.  Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man."
david, I see.  You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
jack, Right.
david, Wrong. The drinkers have gotten the Chess Player to tell the joke as everyone knew he would.
chess player,"Oh, all right.  There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York.  It was full of men from the United Nations."
woman,"That's very funny, that is."
jack," Go on, ask them."
david, You ask them.
chess player,"Here now, let me finish!  So halfway over the ocean the engines run low on petrol so they have to lighten the plane.  So they heave out all the baggage, but it's still too heavy.  So they chuck out the seats, but it's still too heavy!  Finally this Froggy steps up and shouts ""Viva la France"" and leaps out.  Then an Englishman...."
dart players,Hear!  Hear!
chess player," ...steps up and shouts `God save the Queen!' and leaps out.  But the plane is still too heavy.  So the Yank delegate from Texas steps up, shouts, `Remember the Alamo!' and chucks out the Mexican."
jack,"Excuse me, but what's that star on the wall for?"
dart player, You've made me miss.
jack,I'm sorry.
dart player,I've never missed the board before.
david,"Jack, we'd better go."
jack,What do you mean?  I'm starving.
dart player,There's no food here.
david,"Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!"
jack,Apparently so.
woman, You can't let them go.
david, How much do we owe you?
chess player,"Nothing, lads.  Go, God be with you."
david,"Uh, thank you."
woman,Wait!  You just can't let them go!
dart player,Go!  And stay on the road. Keep clear of the moors.
david,"Yes, well, thanks again."
chess player,"Beware the moon, lads!"
jack,What the hell was that all about?
david,I don't know.  Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
jack,Beware the moon?
david,"Come on, I'm freezing."
woman,You can't let them go.
dart player, Should the world know our business?!
chess player,It's murder then.
dart player,Then murder it is!  It's in God's hands now.
dissolve,TO:
david,That was weird.  I guess leaving was the best idea.
jack,"I don't know.  Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood- thirsty mob."
david,"Well, not quite a blood- thirsty mob."
jack,What do you think was wrong?
david,I have no idea.
jack,Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
david,"I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly. There is a flash of lightning that sends a ghostly illuminating sheet of light over the boys' faces.  The clap of thunder follows loud and rumbling."
david,Please don't rain.
david,Of course.
jack,"Say, David...."
david,I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
jack,Santa Lucia...Santa Lucia.
woman,Perhaps they'll be safe in the rain.
chess player,No one brought them here!  No one wanted them here!
woman,You could have told them!
dart player,Are you daft?  What do you think they'd say?  They'd think us mad.
woman,Listen!
woman,Did you hear it?  We must go to them.
dart player,I heard nothing.
chess player,Nor I.
jack,Did you hear that?
david,I heard that.
jack,What was it?
david,Could be a lot of things.
jack,Yeah?
david,A coyote.
jack,There aren't any coyotes in England.
david,The Hound of the Baskervilles.
jack,Pecos Bill.
david,Heathcliffe.
jack,Heathcliffe didn't howl.
david,"No, but he was on the moors."
jack,"It's a full moon, `beware the moon'."
jack,I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
david,Yeah.
david,We're lost.
jack,"Shit!  David, what is that?"
david,I don't know.  Come on.
jack,"Come on, where?"
david,Anywhere!  I think we should just keep moving.
david,It's moving.
jack,It's circling us.
jack,Fuck.
david,What's the plan?
jack, Plan?
david, Let's just keep walking.
david,"That's right, a lovely stroll in the moors.  Tra-la-la, isn't this fun?"
david,It's in front of us.
jack,Do you think it's a dog?
jack,Oh shit.  What is that?
david,A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
jack,Nice doggie.  Good boy.
david,"Walk away, Jack."
jack,"Walking away, yes, sir.  Here we are walking away."
david,See anything?
jack,No.
david,It sounds far away.
jack,Not far enough.  Come on.
david,Jack?
jack,Yeah.
david,Where are we going?
jack,I'll tell you when we get there.
david,Well.  I'm glad we...WHOAA!!
jack,"You really scared me, you shithead."
david,Are you going to help me up?
jack,Jesus fuck!  David!  Please help me!  Please!  David! Shit!  Help me!  Oh God!
david,"Jack?  Oh my God, Jack!"
david,Jack....
david,Jack?!
alex,Mr. Kessler?
alex,Mr. Kessler?
miss gallagher,He all right?
alex,"Yes, I should think.  He called out just now."
miss gallagher,"He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him."
alex,Chart says he's from New York.
miss gallagher,I think he's a Jew.
alex,Why on earth do you say that?
miss gallagher,I looked.
alex," Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now."
alex,"Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago."
miss gallagher,"Yes, Doctor."
miss gallagher,"Yes, Doctor."
alex,Dr. Hirsch?
alex,"Yes, Doctor."
alex,"Yes, Doctor?"
alex,He said `Jack'.
alex,What happened to them?
alex,"No, sir.  Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor."
david,Where am I?
david,London?  Where's Jack?  I had a strange dream.
david,The guy I was with.  Is he all right?  How did I get to London?
david,What?
david,"Ow, shit!"
david,Jack's dead?
david,Everything's in order?  What are you talking about?
david, Who the hell are you people? What's going on here?  Where is Jack?  I demand to see him!
david, Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
david,How long have I been here?
david,Two weeks?
david, Lunatic?
david, It wasn't a lunatic.
alex, I beg your pardon?
david,It was a wolf.
alex, What?
david,A wolf.
alex,"Yes, I believe he did."
david,"I'm sorry if I conflict with your report, but Jack and I were not attacked by a man."
david,There were witnesses?
david,How could there have been witnesses?  It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere...I don't understand what they're talking about.
david,"Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about."

miss gallagher,"Mr. Kessler?  Wake up, please."
david, I was having a nightmare.
miss gallagher,"Yes, well these should help that.  That's right, drink up."
miss gallagher,Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
david,What time is it?
miss gallagher,"It's nearly eight.  I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex."
david,Alex?
miss gallagher,"Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you."
david,What are you going to see?
miss gallagher,"An American film about the Mafia called `See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep."
david," Do you have bad dreams, too?"
miss gallagher,"Some, everyone does."
david,"Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?"
miss gallagher,Bambi?
miss gallagher,Kill Bambi?
alex,"Yes, Mrs. Hobbs."
alex,Has he been refusing food?
alex,"Yes, Mrs. Hobbs."
alex,"Hello, Benjamin."
benjamin,No.
alex,No what?
benjamin,No.
alex,"Well, all right then, be that way.  Here, swallow this."
benjamin,"No. Alex pours a glass of water, gives the pill to Benjamin who promptly takes it and then drinks the water, handing Alex back the glass."
alex,Feeling better?
benjamin,No.
alex,The doctor will be round later.  Would you like a picture book to look at?  We have some lovely funny Beanos.
benjamin,No.
alex,Right.
alex,Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
orderly,"The American?  Yes, duck."
alex,How did he look?
orderly,"What do you mean, `how did he look'?"
alex,"You know, did he seem depressed?  Do you think he'll eat the food?"
orderly," I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist!  I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them."
alex,Thank you.
alex, Mr. Kessler?
david, Yes?
alex,You haven't eaten your lunch.
david,"I'm not very hungry, thank you."
alex,I'm afraid you have to eat something.
david,"Please, really.  I'm not hungry."
alex,"You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler."
david,How is that?
alex," Well, you're to take these after you've eaten.  Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?"
david,Leave the pills.  I'll take them later.
alex,Sorry.
david,"Aw come on, Miss Price!"
alex,Call me Alex.
david,"Aw come on, Alex!"
alex,"Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?"
david,Call me David.
alex,"Shall I be forced to feed you, David?"
david,This is absurd.  I'm not hungry.  I don't want any food.
alex,Right.
alex,"Let's try a little harder, shall we?"
david,Will you give me a break?
alex,"Will I have to take such drastic action again, David?"
david,May I have a glass of milk?
david," Sure, as a kid.  But never so real.  Never so bizarre."
david,"I've told you, it wasn't a man.  It was an animal.  A big wolf or something.  A rabid dog."
david,"Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart.  I saw him.  A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands."
david,Did you see Jack?
david,Did you talk to the police in East Proctor?  Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
david,"Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me?  You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that. DR. HIRSCH  David, please.  The police are satisfied.  I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly."
david,"You really think I'm crazy, don't you?"
david,Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
dissolve,TO:

david,I was.  What are you reading?
alex,`A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
david,Do you like it?
alex,I've just started it.  My friend gave it to me.
alex,What do you dream about?
david,I dream of death mostly.
alex,I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have asked you.
david,It's okay.  I want to talk to you.
david,How old are you?
alex,That's not really a very proper question.
david,How old are you?
alex,Twenty-eight.
david,I'm twenty-seven.
alex,I know.
david,Now what do you want to talk about?
alex,Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
david, My best friend.  My very best friend.
alex, Shall I read to you?
david,"What?  Oh, yes, please."
alex, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens.  This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
david," Yes, go on."
alex," Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about.  He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking.  We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...."
dissolve,TO:
father,I'll get it.
father,"All right, all right!  Hold your horses."
david,Stop!
alex, Hello.  You all right?
david,I'm sorry I woke you up.
alex,Don't be silly.  Can I get you something?
david,"No, thank you.  Just keep me company for a while."
alex,That's easy enough.
david,I keep having these really terrible dreams.  They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
alex,"David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away."
david,Will you come with me?
alex, What?
david, I'm serious.  You don't know me and I know nothing about you.  We have a perfect relationship.
alex,"Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now."
david,Will you think about it?
alex,How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
david, Not just a patient -- me.
alex,"You're being awfully forward, aren't you?"
david,"Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it."
alex, All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
david,Now I'm embarrassed.
alex,Good.  I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
david,Where were we in the book?
alex, Let me see here.
orderly,"Ah you're up.  Good morning and a good day to you.  We've quite a meal for you here this morning.  Bacon, oatmeal, orange juice, and toast with jam.  Good stuff there.  Now eat it up and I'll be back for the dishes when you've finished."
david,Good morning.
david," Please, sir, I want some more."
jack, Nice to see you.
david," Get the fuck out of here, Jack."
jack,Thanks a lot.
david, This is too much.  I can't handle this.
jack,"I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me."
jack,David!  You're hurting my feelings.
david," Hurting your feelings?  Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!"
jack,"I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come."
david, Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
jack,Yeah.  Your parents came to my funeral.  I was surprised at how many people came.
david, Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
jack,Debbie Klein cried a lot.
david,I can't stand it.
jack,So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
david,Rudy Levine the shmuck?
jack,Life mocks me even in death.
david, I'm going completely crazy.
jack, David!
david, What?!
jack,"David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you."
david," Warn me?  Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?"
jack,"I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here.  You've got to know."
david,"If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!"
jack,We were attacked by a werewolf.
david, I'm not listening!
jack,"On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf."
david,"Shut up, you zombie!"
jack,"I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted."
david, What's wrong with you?  Shut up!
jack,The wolf's bloodline must be severed.  The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
david,Will you be quiet?!
jack,"It's you, David."
david,What?!
jack,You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
david,What are you talking about?  I won't accept this!  Get out! God damit!
jack,Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? `Beware the moon.'
david," Stop it, Jack."
jack,"Beware the moon.  The full moon, David.  You've got two days."
david," Jack, please go away.  Please go away."
jack,You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
david, You're talking like Boris Karloff!  It's movie dialogue!
jack,"David, please believe me.  You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins."
david, Nurse!
jack,"Listen to me!  Take your own life, David.  It's our only chance."
david,Nurse!
jack,"The supernatural!  The powers of darkness!  It's all true. Take your own life!  Suicide, David.  Join me."
david, Nurse!  Oh God!  Alex!
jack,"It's cold, David, and I'm so alone.  The undead surround me.  Have you ever talked to a corpse?  It's boring!  I'm lonely!  Kill yourself, David, before you kill others."
jack,"Don't cry, David."
jack,Please don't cry.
jack," Beware the moon, David."
alex,David?  David!
alex,"David, what's wrong?"
david, I'm a werewolf.
alex,A werewolf?
alex,Are you better now?
david,I'll let you know the next full moon.
alex,You're to be discharged tomorrow.  Will you be all right?
david,My friend Jack was just here.
alex,Your dead friend Jack?
david,Yeah.  He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
alex,What do I think?  You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
david,I was dreaming again?
alex,I would think so.
david," Yeah, I would think so, too."
alex,Do you have a place to stay in London?
david,Very nice.
alex,Closet.
david,Charming.
alex,Bathroom.
david,Lovely.
alex,The bedroom.
david,There is only one bed.
alex," David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower."
david,It's nice to see you.
alex,It's nice to see you.
david,Alex?
alex,Yes?
david,Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
alex,Of course.
david, Good.
alex,"David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?"
david,I was awake and he was in my room.
alex,"But, David."
david, I wasn't hallucinating.
alex, Tomorrow is the full moon.
david,"That's good, Alex.  Reassure me."
david,"It's all right, I know I'm being insane."
david,"Okay, okay.  I'm properly reassured!"
david, This is very reassuring.  I'm feeling very reassured.

jack,I wanted to see you.
david,"Okay, you've seen me.  Now go away."
jack,"David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on."
david,I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
jack,Yes.
david,"Get out of here, Jack!"
jack,"David, tomorrow night is the full moon.  You'll change, you'll become...."
david," A monster.  I know, I know."
jack,"You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late."
david,"Jack, are you really dead?"
jack,What do you think?
david,I think I've lost my mind.  I think you're not real.  I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
jack,You must believe me.
david,"What, Jack?  That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people?  Bullshit!"
jack,"The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood!  God damit, David, please believe me!  You'll kill and make others like me!  I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again!  You must take your own life!"
david, I will not accept this!  Now go away!

alex, Dr. Hirsch?
alex,What shall we do?
passenger,Hello?
passenger,Is there someone there?
passenger,I can assure you that this is not in the least bit amusing!
passenger,I shall report this!
passenger,Good Lord.
cut to:,WOLF'S P.O.V.
david,"Wake me up, Alex."
david,Ouch!
alex," Hello?  No, Dr. Hirsch, he hasn't come back yet.  Yes, I will, doctor, but I just feel so helpless sitting here doing nothing.  Thank you, yes, goodbye."
david,Hello.
david,"Excuse me, won't you?"
little boy, I don't know who you are.
little boy,Why would a thief want to give me two pounds?
david,Thank you.
mother,"Yes, love?"
little boy,"A naked, American man stole my balloons."
mother,What?
little boy,"A naked, American man -- the famous balloon thief."
david, A lot of weather we've been having lately.
alex,David!  Where on earth have you been!?!
david,I'm freezing.
david,"Alex, I've lost my mind.  I woke up at the zoo!  But you know what?  I feel terrific!"
alex,The zoo?
david,"Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane.  Having no clothes on?  That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?"
alex,Don't you remember?
david,I said goodbye to you.  I was locked out of the flat.  I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
alex,I worried about you.  We didn't know where you were.
alex,Where did you get that coat?
alex,I'll get it.
alex,Hello?
alex,He doesn't remember.  He woke up at the zoo.
alex,"Yes, he is.  He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean."
alex,"No, why?"
alex,"No, not really."
alex,"Yes, I should think so."
alex,"Yes, Doctor."
alex,He's fine.  We'll come right over.
alex,"No, a cab will be faster."
alex,The next corner we can get a cab.
david, I should be committed.
alex,Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
david, I don't know why I feel so good.  I haven't felt this good in a long time.
david,"My body feels alive, alert.  I feel like an athlete."
alex,Get in.
alex,Saint Martin's Hospital.
driver,Right.
driver,"It's like the days of the Mad Barber of Fleet Street, isn't it?"
alex,I beg your pardon?
driver,The murders.
david, What murders?
driver,Last night.  Haven't you heard?  Six people in different parts of the city mutilated.  A real maniac this one.
david,Pull over.
alex,But....
david, Pull over.
david,Pay the man.
alex,"David, wait!"
alex,"David, what are you doing?"
david,"Six people mutilated?  It had to be me, Alex."
alex,"David, stop!"
david,I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right.  I....
alex, Jack is dead!
david,"Jack is dead.  Look, six people have been killed.  I'm going to the police."
alex,"David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch."
david,"Rational!?!  I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!"
david,"Officer, I killed those people last night."
bobbie," You did, did you?"
alex,"He's playing a stupid joke, sir."
david, What?
alex,We had an argument.  He's being silly.
david," I swear, I don't know this girl."
bobbie,"All right, you two, move along."
david,"Hey, you asshole!  I want you to arrest me!"
bobbie,There's no call for that kind of language.
david, Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
bobbie, Now see here young man.
david,Shakespeare was French!  The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell!  Shit!  Fuck!  Piss!
bobbie,That's quite enough!
alex," David, please!"
david,Who is this girl?
bobbie,You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
david," That's what I want you to do, you moron!"
alex," Sir, he's very upset.  His friend was killed and...."
david,Will you shut up!?!!
bobbie, That's enough!  Now go about your business.
alex,"Yes, David, let's go."
david, You're not going to arrest me?
david,"Don't you think he should arrest me? ONLOOKER Well, I'm not sure.  How does he know this isn't a prank?"
david, A prank?
alex, David....
bobbie,I've no time for this foolishness.  Nothing to look at.  Move along.
david,Hopeless.  It's hopeless.
alex," David, let's go now."
david,"Leave me alone, dammit!  You people are crazy!  I've got to get away from here!  I've got to do something!"
alex," David, don't lose control."
david, Control!?!  What control!?! Get away from me!
david,Leave me alone!
alex,"David, wait!"
alex,He tried to have himself arrested.  He....
alex,He wants help.  He....
alex, What shall we do?
david,"Yes, operator.  I'd like to call the United States and reverse the charges.  David Kessler for anyone.  Yes, I'll wait.  Hello?  Yes, area code 315/472-3402.  Thank you.  Hello?  Rachel?  Just say yes, you'll accept the charges. Just say yes, Rachel.  Is Mom or Dad home?  Where are they? Where's Max?  You're all alone?  Mom and Dad wouldn't leave me alone when I was ten. No, not ten and a half either. I'm still in London.  I'm all better.  Look, would you tell Mom and Dad that I love them? I don't care, Rachel, just do it for me.  Okay?  Good.  And, Rachel, don't fight with Max. Well, try.  Look, kid, please don't forget to tell Mom and Dad I love them.  I love Max and you, too.  Well, I do. No, I'm not being weird, you little creep.  You promise? Okay.  Be a good girl.  I love you.  Bye."
ticket lady,"Two and a half quid, please."
david,Will you take a traveler's check?
ticket lady,"No, sorry."
david,Keep the change.
ticket lady,"Well, thank you, sir!"
david,"Hi, Jack."
jack,"Hi, David."
david,"What can I say, Jack?"
jack,You don't have to say anything.
david,"Aren't you going to say, `I told you so'?"
jack,"If I was still alive, I probably would."
david,You look awful.
jack,Thank you.
david, I didn't mean it.  I don't know what I'm saying.  I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people.  I don't remember doing it.
jack,What about the zoo?
david,"Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that.  I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack."
jack,I want you to meet some people.
jack,"David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly."
david,Hello.
jack,Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway.  We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
bringsly," Yes, I do look most unpleasant."
david," Why are you doing this to me, Jack?"
bringsly,"This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities."
david," Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry.  I have absolutely no idea what to say to you."
bringsly,You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
bringsly,"You must die, David Kessler."
jack,"David, this is Harry Berman and his fiancee Judith Browns."
jack,"And these gentlemen are Alf, Ted, and Joseph."
david, What shall I do?
jack,Suicide.
harry, You must take your own life!
david,That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
bringsly,"No, David.  Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead.  The undead."
david, Why are you doing this to me?
jack,Because this must be stopped.
david,How shall I do it?
judith,Sleeping pills?
david,I could hang myself.
jack,"If you did it wrong, it would be painful.  You'd choke to death."
jack,Do you mind?  The man's a friend of mine.
bringsly,"Gentlemen, please."
harry,A gun.
david,Don't I need a silver bullet or something?
jack,"Be serious, would you?"
david,Madness.  I've gone totally mad.
harry,A gun is good.
judith,You just put the gun to your forehead and pull the trigger.
bringsly,"If you put it in your mouth, then you'd be sure not to miss."
david,"Thank you, you're all so thoughtful."
david, Go away!  Please!  Go away!
david, Run!  Please...run.
ticket lady,"It's horrible, horrible! There's a beast!  A mad dog! It's killing people in there!"
alex,David?
cop,"It's some kind of animal, sir. We.... Suddenly the doors splinter apart and there stands the Wolf, eyes blazing.  It leaps on Lt. Villiers, savaging him.  The crowd falls back in panic."
alex,David!  It's David!
alex,Let me through!
cop,"Stand clear, miss!"
alex,I must get through!
alex,"David?  Is it you?  Is it true, David?"
alex,David?
officer,Fire!
