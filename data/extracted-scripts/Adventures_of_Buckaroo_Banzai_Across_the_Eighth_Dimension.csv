Speaker,Dialogue
shooting script,"Revised Third Draft March 30, 1983 Becherman/Canton-Richter"
narrator,"The advent of the Soviet nuclear capability ushers in a dangerous phase of the Cold War as the decade of the 1950s looms.  Stung by this Soviet challenge and the rapid race to develop ever more sophisticated weapons, the United States resurrects maverick Professor Toichi Hikita's work in electromagnetic particle acceleration...despite the dismal record of failure that has dogged the project."
narrator,"Doctor Masado Banzai, preeminent Japanese quantum theorist, declares himself anxious to work for the Allies.  Enamored of the great American West, Banzai sires a precocious son and tags the tiny child ""Buckaroo."" A tribute to his adopted homeland."
narrator,"And thus given a second chance after his secret pre-war laboratory disaster at Princeton, Doctor Hikita finds new life at the Texas School of Mines, where he assembles a team of crack scientists willing to gamble he's right in his bold assertion that man can indeed pass unharmed through solid matter."
narrator,"Sir Alan Motley of Cambridge, a brainy, affable limey, co-developer with Whitehead and Lord Russell of the world's most advanced theoretical gravity catapult..."
narrator,"Dr. Sandra Banzai, Texas-born pioneer in Negative Mass Propulsion ...wife of Dr. Masado Banzai."
today,THIRTY YEARS LATER
general catburd,You're kidding. Where is he?  Still in the hospital?
general catburd,"Banzai hasn't showed yet, Mr. Secretary. Looks like he's got cold feet."
perfect tommy,"Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno."
reno,Why me?
perfect tommy,'Cause I'm busy.  And get your clodhoppers off the UNIVAC.
nurse,"Rawhide, it's for you."
rawhide,"I'll ask him.  Buckaroo, I need an estimate.  They're getting antsy over at Mission Control."
buckaroo banzai,"Another ten minutes down here, Rawhide."
rawhide, The chief needs ten more minutes.  I got the chopper waiting.  Don't start without us.
tv anchorwoman,So where's Buckaroo?
perfect tommy, Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
perfect tommy,Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
tv anchorwoman, Flying to Cambodia.
perfect tommy,"That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you."
tv anchorwoman,"Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy."
perfect tommy,Bet I do.
star surgeon,Jesus Christ...how does the man find enough hours in the day?
rawhide,We help.
rawhide,"Dr. Banzai's using a laser to fuse artificial nerve fiber to the original, bypassing massive stroke damage.  A subcutaneous microphone's gonna allow the patient to transmit verbal instructions to his own brain."
star surgeon,"What, like ""raise my left arm""?"
rawhide,"Or ""throw the harpoon,"" depending on cultural differences. People are gonna come from all over. This guy's an Eskimo."
jewish physician,"Okay...right...okay, I see...next time I'll be able to..."
buckaroo banzai,There may not be a next time.
jewish physician,Look...I'm sorry...calling for help in the middle of an operation...but I just lost my nerve...I panicked...again.
buckaroo banzai,"You've got the God-given tools to be a success in any field of endeavor, Dr. Zwibel.  Ever thought about joining me full-time?"
buckaroo banzai,Can you sing?
mission control,All systems righteous.  Professor Hikita says we have to go.
general catburd,"I've got a budget meeting on the hill, John.  What's this thing supposed to do anyway?"
senator cunningham,"Three hundred miles an hour, General."
general catburd,"Senator, you are so fulla shit."
buckaroo banzai,Final contact is made.
general catburd,"Too bad war ain't Indianapolis.  It's fast, I'll give Banzai that."
senator cunningham,"Perhaps an idea whose time has come, General?  Scoot over."
general catburd,It'll never work.  It's too simple.
tv anchorwoman,"Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?"
perfect tommy,"She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive."
general catburd,So what?  Big deal.  Anybody can drive fast in a straight line.
mission control,Advise you abort.  Over.  Repeat: advise abort.
buckaroo banzai,"That's a big ""no can do""."
tv anchorwoman,The Jet Car off the road!  Radio contact with Mission Control here severed...that firestorm apparently interfering with communications...Buckaroo Banzai in serious trouble.
general catburd,Either that or he's popped his cookies.
mission control,"Eject, Buckaroo! EJECT!"
senator cunningham,"Professor Hikita, what'd he say?"
general catburd,Looks like Banzai's finally gonna get more than he bargained for.  And take the friends of the Earth with him.
mission control,It's off my scope!
general catburd,What the devil?  What is going on?!
helicopter newsman," He's through it!  He's gone through the mountain without a scratch! Oh, my God!  Oh, my God in Heaven!"
buckaroo banzai,Chute negative.  I'm gonna try and lay her sideways.
general catburd,This his frequency?  Nobody's home.
buckaroo banzai,See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
general catburd,"Creatures?  Buckaroo, Catburd here.  I got egg all over my face, but that's okay. No room for egos here.  We're all Americans and I wanna buy that thing of yours.  What's it gonna run me?"
general catburd,"I wasn't talking to you, Hikita san."
perfect tommy,"She's not for sale, right, General?"
doctor lizardo, The Overthruster! The Overthruster!
doctor lizardo, The Overthruster!
doctor lizardo,More!  More!
guard,"Cheer up, Lizardo, it's Friday.  I come for your TV.  You been using too damn much juice...ten thousand kilowatts again this month.  Beats me how one old homicidal loony could use that much power."
doctor lizardo,I want my TV...don't take my TV...I want it.  I want the Overthruster. I want it.
rawhide,Five...four...three...two...one.
buckaroo banzai,"I'm starving...somebody, help."
rawhide,Got a half a tuna sandwich.
buckaroo banzai,Same one you had yesterday?
buckaroo banzai,"Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher."
reno,And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
buckaroo banzai,Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
perfect tommy,"Coming right up, Buckaroo."
buckaroo banzai,Anybody we know?
perfect tommy,Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?
perfect tommy,Super performance organic material.
buckaroo banzai," Too closely.  Gotta be more than sheer coincidence.  Rawhide, you're keen on bugs.  What do you think?"
reno,"Everything's copacetic at the Institute, Buckaroo.  Sam's with the Jet Car and she's under lock and key.  He's retiming her valves."
perfect tommy,"Buckaroo, you got a minute--?"
buckaroo banzai,Not really.  This is pretty important.
perfect tommy,She wants a picture.
artie duncan,"I don't care who you are...when you play my joint, you're just another band. I want some music outta you characters."
buckaroo banzai,Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
perfect tommy,I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
rawhide,No question about it.  Something very akin to arachnoid tissue.  If I hadda guess?  A mutated species.
buckaroo banzai,I heard somebody crying.  I said is someone out there crying in the darkness?
penny priddy,Here...here at the back. I'm sorry...
buckaroo banzai,Raise your hand...where?
penny priddy, This is so embarrassing...
buckaroo banzai,Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
penny priddy,Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
buckaroo banzai,"Did you say...""Peggy""?"
penny priddy,"My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody."
buckaroo banzai,Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
penny priddy," Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I..."
buckaroo banzai,He offered you money?
penny priddy,"Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job."
buckaroo banzai,"Remember it's always darkest just before the dawn.  Believe me, I've been there."
buckaroo banzai,This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
penny priddy," My name's, Penny!  But who cares?"
penny priddy,"Let me go, let me go, you creeps..."
buckaroo banzai,Everybody okay up here?
guard,"Where do you think you're going, doc? The moon?"
perfect tommy,"Pick those up, Reno."
reno,I didn't drop 'em.
perfect tommy,It's a spittin' image.
perfect tommy,Pictures don't lie.
perfect tommy,"It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?"
rawhide,"Hot off the World Watch Wire, Buckaroo. Thought you'd wanna be notified. That old pal of the professor's, Dr. Emilio Lizardo?  The one you did the brain scan on--?  He killed a guard last night, broke outta the Trenton Home for the Criminally Insane, stole a Masarati, totaled it a block away."
buckaroo banzai,Then what?
rawhide,Vanished. Thin air.
perfect tommy,Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
reno,You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
perfect tommy,"Hey, so was Mr. Wizard."
rawhide,"Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours."
buckaroo banzai,Have you warned Professor Hikita?
rawhide,First thing I did.
perfect tommy," Why?  What's going on?  Anything I oughta know?  C'mon, Rawhide, spill it."
rawhide,"The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange..."
buckaroo banzai,And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
rawhide,"He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away the key."
perfect tommy,"Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?"
buckaroo banzai,I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
rawhide,And another thing.  Somebody took five bucks outta petty cash without signing.
perfect tommy,"Wasn't me.  I'd take a hundred, right?"
buckaroo banzai,"Doubt it.  Check NORAD command.  Could be a volcanic ash cloud.  Work her up statistically, check it for the next twenty-four hours, then shovel the data over to Reno."
buckaroo banzai,"Sid, welcome aboard.  Fellas, meet a medical colleague, Sid Zwibel.  He'll be riding with us from now on, so get acquainted while I snoop around."
reno,The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
perfect tommy,"Where do you hail from, Doc?"
reno nevada,Where's your spurs at?
perfect tommy,"Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands."
reno,Why me?
perfect tommy,Cause Buckaroo needs me here.
reno,"Follow me, pard'ner."
penny priddy,What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
buckaroo banzai,"I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness."
penny priddy,Go away.  Let me rot?
buckaroo banzai,Who were you really trying to kill last night?
penny priddy,You.  Like the papers all say.
buckaroo banzai,Pretty terrible shot.
penny priddy,Was she pretty?
buckaroo banzai,Who?
penny priddy,The girl I remind you of.
buckaroo banzai,She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
penny priddy,It's kinda hard this way.
buckaroo banzai,"I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me."
penny priddy,"The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming."
buckaroo banzai,"Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?"
penny priddy,"No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything."
buckaroo banzai,"No, I don't."
buckaroo banzai,"Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?"
penny priddy,Which?  The one in my throat.
buckaroo banzai,Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
penny priddy,"I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me..."
buckaroo banzai,Another 'you'?
penny priddy,Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
buckaroo banzai,"Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!"
penny priddy,What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
buckaroo banzai,Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...
perfect tommy,"Running a little late, Buckaroo."
buckaroo banzai,Let her out. In my custody.
perfect tommy,Let her out?  She's a killer.
buckaroo banzai,No she's not.
buckaroo banzai," I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case."
buckaroo banzai,"Mr. Secretary...Senator Cunningham, ladies and gentlemen...thirty years ago, nearly to this day, my mother and father and Sir Alan Motley, all former colleagues of Professor Toichi Hikita at the Texas School of Mines, gave their lives for what was considered at the time an insane notion: the possibility of contacting alien life... not on another planet, but on a simultaneous plane of existence within solid matter...life which, before the war, Professor Hikita had actually glimpsed while pioneering a highly primitive gravity catapult with Doctor Emilio Lizardo."
buckaroo banzai,"I don't wanna go get too technical here, ladies and gentlemen, but I'm talking twister physics.  Quantum Mechanics.  Now you see, now you don't.  This table I'm sitting behind?  It appears to be solid matter, right?"
buckaroo banzai,"But in point of fact, the solid parts of this table... the protons, quarks, your neutrons and electrons...they comprise only about one quadrillionth of its total volume."
buckaroo banzai,"Exactly.  So the professor here, way back in 1937, figured that if solid matter is mostly empty space, a person oughta be able to discover a to travel inside things like tables.  And mountains."
buckaroo banzai,"Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?"
penny priddy,"Hey, better there than here, huh?"
buckaroo banzai,The president of what?
buckaroo banzai,Is he still delirious?
penny priddy,"Buckaroo, don't forget your thruster."
buckaroo banzai,You keep an eye on it.
penny priddy,Any time.
buckaroo banzai,Mr. President--?  Some kind of interference...I can't...
rawhide,Maybe it's just a prankster. Some computer whiz kid.
reno,"Whoever it was they used the Blue Code, Alpha Clearance."
buckaroo banzai, Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
rawhide,And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
buckaroo banzai,Pencil!  Quick!  Pen!  Anything!
penny priddy," I don't guess they matter.  It's like cheesecloth, I think.  Minkowiski space..."
buckaroo banzai,There!  Those two!  Don't panic...
reno,"Whadda you mean, Buckaroo?  Where?  What?"
buckaroo banzai,"Evil...pure and simple, from the eighth dimension! Grab 'em!"
buckaroo banzai,Arachtoids! Stop 'em!
senator cunningham,Arachtoids?
john bigboot,"Okay, wise guys!"
john bigboot,"Let those gun belts hit the floor! And nobody follows, or the prof is history!"
penny priddy,"Is this the kind of society you want?  A society of weak-kneed jellyfish wallowing in self-pity, prey to ruthless hoodlums who pick us off like flies?"
senator cunningham,"Or a society where we stand strong, take charge of our own destiny, with the cry ""So far and no farther will we be pushed!"""
exhibitor,"Hey, you can't ride that!"
perfect tommy,Any sign of Buckaroo?
reno,No!  Ditto the professor-
rawhide,Shit!
duck hunters,My God!  What the hell...
duck hunters,Jesus Christ--!  What is it?
john bigboot,"A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?"
john gomez,John Whorfin...maybe they know he's escaped!
john bigboot, They know everything!  I told Whorfin to sit tight.  This could be the end of us all!  We gotta get Banzai's Overthruster and get off this rock!
john bigboot,"Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?"
john gomez,Death to the enemy!
buckaroo banzai,Rawhide.  Come in.  Over.
rawhide,"Over, Buckaroo.  What's up?  Where in Hades are you?  I'm getting a lotta static."
buckaroo banzai,"That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals."
rawhide,"Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!"
buckaroo banzai,The deuce you say.  That crate!
rawhide,What crate?
buckaroo banzai,I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
rawhide, Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?
penny priddy,"How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?"
reno,Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
penny priddy,What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
reno,Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
penny priddy,Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
reno,Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
rawhide,All right.  Let's go!  We got our work cut out for us tonight!
rawhide,"You, too, Miss Penny."
john bigboot,"No thanks, I'm driving."
highway patrolman,Hand me that tarp. Let's cover this guy...
john bigboot,"John Bigboot, Officer. Executive Vice President, Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems."
john gomez, One of our birds.
highway patrolman,"That fella over there-that one of yours, too, is it?"
john bigboot,"The droid, you mean?"
highway patrolman,"Looks like nothing I ever seen. I seen droids in space movies, but they're nothing like this-"
john gomez,It's a three-man thermopod...
highway patrolman,Thermopod?  What's a...
john bigboot,"Very T.S.  Top Secret, right John Gomez?"
highway patrolman,"Yeah, well, I was gonna call Buckaroo Banzai out here to have a look. Right up his alley, I think."
john bigboot,You called Buckaroo Banzai?
highway patrolman,Not yet.  I said I was gonna.
highway patrolman,Go on!  Keep it moving!
john gomez,"We got a truck on the way to mop things up for you.  Else this place could become a zoo, not to mention a haven for gawkers."
john bigboot,We'll just go ahead and start breaking it down.
highway patrolman,Don't touch it!  I got my own help on the way!  That's an order!
john bigboot,There's a crowbar in the truck.
buckaroo banzai,Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
buckaroo banzai,"I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look..."
buckaroo banzai,Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
buckaroo banzai,It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
buckaroo banzai,Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
buckaroo banzai, There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
buckaroo banzai,Hurry!  Please.
highway patrolman,"If you're gonna stay, you're gonna be under arrest.  It's your choice."
perfect tommy,Twelve minutes since the last signal. Long time.
rawhide,"Too long.  We better get somebody over there.  Put up the grid, last known location--"
perfect tommy,Done.
john bigboot,Open it!
scooter lindley,"This is Scooter Lindley, Future Knight of the Blue Shield 411/2. Hang on!"
scooter lindley,Dad! Dad! Buckaroo's in trouble!
casper lindley,Say what?!
new jersey,Trouble?
rawhide,Nah-Damn sophisticated equipment always breaking down.
penny priddy,What's his problem?
reno,Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
penny priddy,Better than him.
highway patrolman,Whadda you think you're doing?  Hey!
highway patrolman,I said back off!  I mean it.  Now get in your car and get the hell outta here!
reno,"She's not Peggy, Mrs. Johnson--"
rawhide,Any word from Buckaroo?
brainy kid,"Hi, fellas...gonna lay down some background vocals tonight?"
rawhide,"Wish life was so simple, Billy.  Remember that outfit the Justice Department checked into last year-Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?"
perfect tommy,You got her.  Buckaroo's orders: access their data bank.  Attack their systems.  Up to it?
billy,I'm a little short-handed tonight.  My phone phreaks went into town for the big ice cream social...
new jersey,So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
billy,Who're you?
john gant,"Detonator set.  My most profuse apologies to my homeland and loved ones.  John Valuk is dead.  He fell on his head, but perhaps John Parker will get through!"
highway patrolman,"That's it, gentlemen, you're all under..."
voice,"Easy, friend-"
casper lindley,"Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter."
buckaroo banzai,"Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried."
buckaroo banzai,Not the famous Scooter....?
scooter lindley,Wow.  You know it.
pinky carruthers,"The prof just rolled in.  Says he's on his way to the lab and ""Do not disturb."""
rawhide,Try a new cipher.  Try G.
new jersey,"Nice work, kid."
reno," The professor just pulled in, jabbering something about space monsters, locked himself in his lab."
perfect tommy,"""Space monsters""...my ass."
penny priddy,What happened to her?
penny priddy,Any what?
penny priddy,What's up those stairs?
billy,This is queer...look...
new jersey,New Jersey?
reno,Looks like none of these guys ever lived anywhere else.  No places of birth.  And all of them with the same first name: John.
new jersey,"November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!"
new jersey,"Halloween. 1938...""War of the Worlds""...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax."
billy,Then that's it!
reno,What's it?
new jersey,Right!  Hoax my eye!
reno,You mean--?  No!
billy,Yes!  Martians!  Right across the river in Grover's Mills!
pinky carruthers,"Hi, buddy, what can I do for ya?"
john parker,Buckaroo Banzai?
pinky carruthers,You a messenger? What've you got here?
john parker,I need see Buckaroo Banzai in person. My name is John Parker. Identify yourself.
pinky carruthers,"Knight Commander, Pinky Carruthers. Sorry, John, all these people ""need see"" Buckaroo in person."
sudden voice,"That's as far as you go, pal."
sam,"Okay, who's the funny guy?"
john bigboot,John Whorfin will kill us!
john gomez,Professor Hikita!
buckaroo banzai,Is the professor here? Where's Penny?
buckaroo banzai,What? How do you know that?
rawhide,It's all on the record. Come on-
buckaroo banzai,"Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?"
perfect tommy,"Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey..."
reno,"...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for..."
buckaroo banzai,Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
perfect tommy,"Lizardo caused it all.  Because he was already here on earth, screwing around with his own stupid Overthruster."
rawhide,Faulty design.  It sucked.
reno,...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
buckaroo banzai,Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
perfect tommy,It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
buckaroo banzai,It?  Who does?
hologram,"Salutations, great Buckaroo Banzai.  I am John Emdall from Planet 10. A common grave danger confronts both our worlds."
buckaroo banzai,Will everybody please shut up so I can hear this thing?
pinky carruthers,"""John Parker"" I think he called himself, this Rasta man on a bike dressed up in aluminum foil.  With a weird album...how the hell was I supposed to know he came from outer space?"
john emdall,"And now, you, Buckaroo Banzai, have unintentionally helped John Whorfin further with your Oscillation Overthruster! For our intelligence warns us that John Whorfin is about to make good his escape from Earth back through the Eighth Dimension...and on to Planet 10! If he should attempt this we will have no choice but to disrupt worldwide electronic communications and fire a particle beam weapon from your airspace to Smolensk, in the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics."
perfect tommy,An action the Kremlin will most certainly misinterpret as an American first strike!
john emdall,"Exactly, Perfect Tommy.  The Soviets will retaliate.  Your President Widmark will launch a massive counterforce strike...and within twenty minutes the danger to Planet 10 will be removed..."
reno,"God, if it's not one thing it's another."
john emdall,"But...because we're good guys, we're giving you a chance to save your planet.  Stop John Whorfin before sunrise! If you fail we will be forced to help you destroy yourselves.  End of discussion."
buckaroo banzai,"You wanna take the chance, Casper?"
casper lindley,Not me. No way.
buckaroo banzai,"Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car."
scooter lindley,"Wow, you know it!"
reno,Where're you goin'?
buckaroo banzai,To get my guns.
perfect tommy,His guns?  Holy shit.
buckaroo banzai,Open up or I'll shoot it off.
penny priddy,"I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me."
buckaroo banzai,"Penny, look-"
penny's voice,You look.  Who is she?
buckaroo banzai,That's kinda complicated to get into right now because the world's maybe coming to an end and I can't stand here and talk to a closet door.
penny's voice,"Yeah, whose world is coming to an end?  You only wanted me because I remind you of her."
buckaroo banzai,"Penny, I was going to get into that, but I haven't had time...with arachtoids and all...but briefly she was your long lost twin sister, we got married, and that's about all I can say.  Right now.  Penny?"
penny priddy,"Married--?  So that's it!  Buckaroo Banzai, a married man.  Where is she?  With the kids some place?"
penny priddy,She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
buckaroo banzai,"She was killed, Penny."
penny priddy,"Oh, my."
buckaroo banzai,Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
penny priddy,Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
buckaroo banzai,Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
penny priddy,How did she die?  I wanna know.
buckaroo banzai,You don't wanna know.
penny priddy,"Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think."
buckaroo banzai,She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
penny priddy,Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
buckaroo banzai,I wish he was.  He's real enough.
penny priddy,"God, she's so young and beautiful.  I don't remember her at all.  Which I guess is good, under the circumstances.  I bet you'll never forget her though."
buckaroo banzai,Never.
penny priddy,"I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy..."
buckaroo banzai,I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
penny priddy,Go where?  Where're you going?
buckaroo banzai," Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right."
penny priddy,What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
buckaroo banzai,"Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself."
penny priddy,Believe in Penny Priddy?
buckaroo banzai,Absolutely.
penny priddy,"You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please..."
buckaroo banzai,It's too dangerous.
penny priddy,That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
perfect tommy, Buckaroo--! Sorry--
buckaroo banzai,"What is it, Tommy?"
perfect tommy,Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab...
buckaroo banzai,"Stay here, I'll be back."
penny priddy,Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
penny priddy,Whadda you want?
buckaroo banzai,Dead.  Damnit!
perfect tommy,Where's the professor?
reno,Where's Rawhide?
casper,Who'd do a thing like this?
new jersey,Arachtoids.
buckaroo banzai,Spread out. They can't be far.
rawhide,"Look out, Buckaroo!"
rawhide,Behind you!
buckaroo banzai,You okay?
rawhide,Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
buckaroo banzai,Professor--!?
penny priddy,Buckaroo!  Rawhide!  Reno?  Anybody?
rawhide,You're a welcome sight...
buckaroo banzai,"Just 'grazed' you, huh?"
rawhide,Apache?
buckaroo banzai,Arachtoid.
rawhide,So I was right.  That's nice to know...
pinky carruthers,"We found the guy, Rawhide, sucker dug a hole and tried to..."
buckaroo banzai,Any antidote for these things?
john parker,"No, none."
perfect tommy,That mean you're on our side?
rawhide," We gotta stop 'em, Buckaroo."
buckaroo banzai,"We will, old fried, we will."
rawhide,Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
buckaroo banzai,There's another one we owe 'em.
casper lindley,They're stealing my chopper!
reno,And they got Penny!  Look!
buckaroo banzai,Don't shoot!
john parker,Then your planet is doomed.
buckaroo banzai,No!  We'll get it back.
nurse,"These'll make you a tenny bit drowsy, Mr. President."
president widmark,"That's okay, Bonnie, I won't be operating any heavy machinery today."
president widmark,As are all sane men today.
president widmark,World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
president widmark,"That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it like out there in the real world?"
president widmark,"You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo."
buckaroo banzai,"To cut right to the bottom line on this, sir, we have reason to believe that there are moving freely among us, vicious red aliens disguised as the owners and operators of Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems."
buckaroo banzai,"The gentleman standing here with me is called John Parker, and he can corroborate everything I've said because he's from Planet 10 too."
president widmark,"Buckaroo...you and I, we go back a long, long way together...but..."
president widmark,"Explosive? What are you saying, man? Some kind of race war in New Jersey--?"
buckaroo banzai,"No, sir.  This 'man' as you call him, is not a human being, Mr. President.  He's a black arachtoid."
president widmark,A what?
president widmark,"You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each other pretty well, I think."
new jersey,There's your answer!  Electromagnetic bacterial crap!
new jersey,We inhale the bacteria.  It swims to our cerebral cortex and reprograms our consciousness.  Diabolical.  We only see what they want us to see.
buckaroo banzai,"I've got it, Mr. Secretary.  But unfortunately the Oscillation Overthruster is in Penny Priddy's possession and she's been kidnapped and taken to Yoyodyne, further exacerbating the situation. We're on our way there right now."
president widmark,Who the hell's Penny Priddy?
perfect tommy,"Buckaroo, John Parker has the arachtoid cloud on line 2!"
president widmark,Good God...
president widmark,"Get me SAC HQ: Omaha, NORAD, and the Strategic Space Command. I want some hard data on that cloud. We got any killer satellites over Jersey- -?"
buckaroo banzai," John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall."
john parker," Buckaroo Banzai says patience is a virtue, Wing Commander, sir."
buckaroo banzai,Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
doctor lizardo,"Well, well...Dr. Banzai. Perhaps you don't remember me?  Ah, I'm flattered.  We know the same people.  In fact, one of them is here with me now...your associate, Doctor Penny Priddy."
penny priddy,"I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!"
buckaroo banzai,Penny--?!  Are you all right?
buckaroo banzai,"She knows nothing, Lizardo."
doctor lizardo,"Then shall we say ""A Penny for your thoughts?"" You can come in her place. Yoyodyne, Dr. Banzai. Come alone, with your Overthruster!  He'll bring it.  I know his type."
doctor lizardo,Take her to the pit!  Use more honey.  Find out what she knows.
penny priddy,"Who are you?  Hanoi Shan?  The Scourge of Burma!  The Pivot of Mystery? Well, you're not destroying me like you did my sister!"
buckaroo banzai,"These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow."
john parker,They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
buckaroo banzai,"I'm working under the assumption that Penny still has the Overthruster. That'll be my job: get it back in one piece.  Here's the main gate. I'll pass through first, alone.  The rest of you divide into two strike groups-Apache Team...that's you, Reno...and Chaparral Team, Perfect Tommy.  John Parker'll ride with Chaparral."
buckaroo banzai,Top priority is the Overthruster. Whorfin can't escape without it. The built-in tracking device should make it relatively simple to locate...maybe hard to get.
president widmark,What's happening with my call to SAC?
president widmark,Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
president widmark,Should we be on Code Red?
general catburd,"We go to Code Red, the Russians go to Code Red...no sense jumping off half-cocked, Mr. President."
senator cunningham,I don't know...Buckaroo Banzai's never been wrong before.
general catburd,"The man went through solid matter, for crying out loud. Who knows what it did to his brain...maybe scrambled his molecules. All I'm saying is, let's not panic here!  I'm sure there's a rational explanation..."
president widmark,We've got no choice then.  Call my wife.
general catburd,"Mr. President, none of us here are lunatics or irrational men...  ...or persons.  I'm a soldier and I'm a damn good one, enough decorations to snap a Christmas tree, but I don't mind telling you, I'm sure I speak for everyone in this room when I say I am scared. I'm barely holding my fudge right now."
senator cunningham,"Stop acting like a goddamn schoolgirl, General, and pull yourself together."
president widmark,"I'm glad someone has the balls to face facts!  Forget we're the good guys and we'd never attack first.  They think we're godless monsters just like them.  Put yourself in their samovars...sitting in the dark without radar, bells ringing all over the damn Kremlin, little men in fedora hats getting out of Zils, coming into the Great Hall of the People.  Now, do you think they're gonna listen to reason?  I'll give Buckaroo his Planet 10 space cloud, but do you think they will?"
general catburd,Hail Mary.
president widmark,"So what's our counter option, General Catburd?  Earn your salary."
general catburd,"I guess we have to prick this boil and take the heat, sir.  Hit 'em primero...blast 'em off the face of the Earth before they lose their heads and do it to us first."
president widmark,"Larry, where's my Football?"
general catburd,"What're you waiting for, boy?  Get in here with that thing."
reno,We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
perfect tommy,Asshole probably got lost.
new jersey,Or nailed for speeding.
buckaroo banzai,"Can I have everyone's attention?  I'm not a rah-rah kinda guy, and I'm not much for speeches, but things could get rough out there tonight. It's a fight we didn't ask for, but it's a fight we're stuck with and we all saw what happened to Rawhide.  So if for any reason this is good-bye, I want you all to know that...well...that...you crazy lugs..."
reno,"What, Buckaroo?  You trying to tell us something?"
buckaroo banzai,Let's just fry those arachtoids.
buckaroo banzai,Give me thirty minutes.  Then come in and mop up.
president widmark,Well... that's certainly food for thought.
general catburd,"Here you go, Mr. President...the Sealed Authenticators.  The Plan D Documents for your eyes only...John-Hancock these, and we got ourselves a knockout little force posture..."
senator cunningham,"You know, on second thought, maybe we should think this through a bit more so that future generations of..."
president widmark,"""Name of the enemy""?  What, Planet 10?  My hand's shaking.  How on earth can I even...have to stay awake, alert...that's my job.  That's what the people put me here for."
doctor lizardo,Blacks are on this planet! Here in New Jersey! Coming to destroy us! We must move! Escape or die!
doctor lizardo,You must work faster to finish the Great Vehicle. So that we can enter the Eighth Dimension and free our trapped comrades! So we can return to our homeland and seize power once again!
red arachtoids,To Planet 10!
red arachtoids,Real soon!
john gomez,Not here!
doctor lizardo,WHERE IS THE OVERTHRUSTER!
buckaroo banzai,I thought you had it!
doctor lizardo,Solve them! The shock tower is a lie detector. Any untruth triggers a brutal charge to your auditory meatus...
buckaroo banzai,You're not getting a damn thing outta me until Penny's safe.
buckaroo banzai,I've got nothing but time.
doctor lizardo,"Sealed with a curse as sharp as a knife...doomed is your soul, and damned is your life!"
doctor lizardo,I want my missing circuit now!
buckaroo banzai,You bloody--!
doctor lizardo,"She'll live...for a while, and she won't enjoy it."
doctor lizardo,"Only you can save her from the fate of your friend, Mr. Rawhide!  Solve this equation.  I must have the crucial missing circuit."
buckaroo banzai,"The missing circuit's in your head, Whorfin."
buckaroo banzai,John Emdall told me.
perfect tommy,Light precipitation.  Partly cloudy tomorrow.
scooter lindley,"Could I have your autograph, Mr. Parker?"
scooter lindley,"Say, ""To my best friend Scooter..."""
john parker,You got it.
perfect tommy,"Not on this bus, you're not."
perfect tommy,Perfect Tommy.
perfect tommy,"Go ahead, Louie, do like the man says."
perfect tommy," Hey, so we get into action quicker this way.  We tell Buckaroo our watches were fast."
guard,It's Bigboot.
john parker,"Under here, I think."
perfect tommy,Under where?  Hold on...
perfect tommy,"Hope you know where you're going, John Parker.  Because my nose is starting to whistle..."
perfect tommy,Thanks.
john parker,Don't mention it.
perfect tommy,Then I won't.
john parker,They sense us.  Hurry.
doctor lizardo,Stop him!  Get him!
doctor lizardo, Kill the girl!
john bigboot,That's 'Bigboot'.
john bigboot,"It's not my goddamn planet!  Understand, monkey boy!?"
john bigboot,Damn John Whorfin--!
john parker,"Look out, Buckaroo Banzai!"
new jersey,Leave her to me. You take care of business.
buckaroo banzai,Thanks.
doctor lizardo,Sound the call to board ship!
john bigboot,Without the crucial missing circuit?  We'll never make it!
doctor lizardo,You heard my orders!  Activate the Special Horns!
doctor lizardo,Massacre them! Without quarter!
doctor lizardo,Close the doors!
buckaroo banzai,What is this thing?  A fighter?
john parker,"Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school."
doctor lizardo,Overthruster in place.
john bigboot,It won't work! It won't!
doctor lizardo,"Shut up, John Bigboote, you coward!"
doctor lizardo,"Again, John O'Connor!  Again!"
buckaroo banzai,They haven't got enough power.  They'll never penetrate!
doctor lizardo,Almost!  Almost!  Lower my vehicle onto the runway!
john bigboot,No!  Please!
john parker,We're going down!  Onto the runway!
buckaroo banzai,The door's locked.
small voice,"Another step, I'll drink your blood--!"
scooter lindley,Get 'em up!
scooter lindley,What's that?
john bigtoote,We haven't a chance.  Your Overthruster's for shit!  We'll all just...
john whorfin,"One more word out of you, Bigboote..."
john bigtoote,Bigboot.
whorfin's voice,Full speed ahead!  Battle stations!
buckaroo banzai,Tell them to stop.  They're your friends!
john parker,"I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai."
buckaroo banzai,At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!
buckaroo banzai,"Does this thing have guns, John Parker?"
john parker,"Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai."
buckaroo banzai,"Take the throttle, John Parker!"
john whorfin,Banzai!  I'll see you in hell!
buckaroo banzai,"Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!"
john parker,"Now, Buckaroo Banzai?"
buckaroo banzai,Now!
doctor lizardo,Toichi--?  I'll be damned.
buckaroo banzai,All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
perfect tommy,New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
buckaroo banzai,Got a casualty list?
reno,"Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em..."
buckaroo banzai,And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
perfect tommy,"Hey, Scooter Lindley, fall in!"
scooter lindley,"Is this what you're looking for, Buckaroo?"
buckaroo banzai,Looks like one Junior Shield is in line for a ride in The Jet Car.
scooter lindley,"Wow, you know it!  I'll have to ask my dad."
buckaroo banzai,"Well, go ahead, what're you waiting for?"
new jersey,I did all I could.  I did my best...
buckaroo banzai,"Tell him yes on ""1"" and no on ""2""."
buckaroo banzai,Penny!
buckaroo banzai,Open your eyes!  Look at me!  Penny!
penny priddy,Buckaroo...you look awful.
