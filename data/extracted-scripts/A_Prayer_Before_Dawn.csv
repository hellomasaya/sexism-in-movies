billy,"Those aren't mine.  Kiaw says something in Thai. Bull Guard shouts angrily back. Kiaw talks/gestures to Billy -- says the heroin is his;  Billy shakes his head ""no,"" frantic, terror stricken. Officer Pi Sit just keeps staring at him.  As Bull Guard shouts in Thai, Billy snatches the shirt from his hands and tries to put it on.  Too small. Doesn't fit. A SLEEVE rips, then hangs off.  Bull Guard goes silent. Officer Pi Sit looks at Billy and Kiaw. A VERY SCARY, VERY INTENSE MOMENT.....  Officer Pi Sit turns, signals sharply to the Trustees.  IN A FLASH, the Trustees grab Kiaw and fiercely hurry him out of the yard.  Kiaw protests, frantic-- as Billy watches, shackled, still.  Trustees wrestle Kiaw to an upstairs office and shut the door.  There's a sudden SQUALL OF FEEDBACK over the LOUD SPEAKERS, followed by SOUNDS of footsteps scuffling -- A door being slammed -- A chair being dragged -- Kiaw being interrogated --  IT GOES ON AND ON FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN JUST STOPS.  SILENCE.  Then the SCREAMING begins.  Billy and the prisoners are frozen, listening to the SOUND OF KIAW'S BLOOD-CHILLING SCREAMS as TRUSTEES SAVAGELY BEAT HIM WITH BATONS.  84   I/E. - VARIOUS P.A. SPEAKERS + PRISON LOCATIONS - THAT MOMENT 84  The beating/screams/sobs broadcast across the entire prison.  85   EXT.

trustee's voice,"William Moore, yat yeim...William Moore, yat yeim"
bull guard,"stands over, puts a boot on Billy's chest. No response. He yanks the shirt off Billy's face."
