Speaker,Dialogue
college counselor,"... For those of you going on to college next year, the chance of finding a good job will actually decrease by the time you graduate. Entry level jobs will drop from thirty-one to twenty-six percent, and the median income for those jobs will go down as well ..."
health teacher,... The chance of contracting HIV from a promiscuous lifestyle will climb to one in one hundred and fifty. The odds of dying in an auto accident are only one in twenty-five hundred.  Now this marks a drastic increase ...
science teacher,"... From just four years ago when ozone depletion was at ten percent of its current level. By the time you are twenty years old, average global temperature will have risen two and a half degrees. Even a shift of one degree can cause such catastrophic consequences as typhoons, floods, widespread drought and famine."
science teacher, Okay. Who can tell me what famine is?
betty,How was your day?
george,"Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought."
betty,Oh darling that's wonderful!  I always knew you could do it.
david," ""It might be ..."""
david's mom,"No--you have custody the first weekend of every month and this is the first weekend ...  I don't care if yesterday was the thirtieth, this is still the first weekend."

marysue,Mother ... Father ... Bud has a little surprise for you.
betty,What's that Bud?
bud,"First prize at the science fair. There were lots of swell projects--guess mine was just the ""swellest""."

bud,"Well gee whizz, Mom. lt wasn't the ""English"" fair."
david, What's a mother to do?
david,Hi. I mean ...  ... Hi.
david,Look. You probably don't think I should be asking you this. I mean--not knowing you well and all ...
david, I mean I know you--everybody knows you ... I just don't know you ... technically.
david,"Well--I was just wondering--'cause I see you all the time in Algebra and I heard you humming that Van Halen song and I really like that song too ...  Anyhow, I don't know what you're doing this weekend but my Mom's leaving town and she said I could use her car so ..."
howard,"Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?"
david,Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
howard,Scout?

jennifer,Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
betty, Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.

david,We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
jennifer,Play along?
david,"Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue."
jennifer, No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
david,We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
jennifer,Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
david,To who?
fireman,"C'mere, kitty ..."
jennifer,"Oh God, we are. We're stuck in like ""Nerdville"".  ... But it's just not fair. I mean--I'm starting to get really--popular. Debbi Russell transferred to another school and my skin's been great since March and Mark Davis is starting to come around and ..."
jennifer,Um ... It's ...
biff,"Ah, right ...  Well--guess I'll see ya later Mary Sue."
jennifer,Who's that?
david,Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
jennifer," Does he--you know--like ""me""?"
david,As a matter of fact he does.
jennifer, Hunh.
jennifer,Those are my friends.
david,"Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean."
jennifer, Can we do any better?
david,I don't think so.
lisa anne, Mary Sue. You're gonna be late for Geography.
jennifer,Okay ...
miss peters,"Last week Class, we discussed the geography of Main Street. This week, we're going to be talking about Elm Street. Can anyone tell me one of the differences between Elm Street and Main Street?  Tommy."
tommy,It's not as long?
miss peters,"That's right, Tommy. It's not as long. Also, it only has houses. So the geography of Main Street is different than the geography of Elm Street."
miss peters,Mary Sue.
jennifer,What's outside of Pleasantville?
miss peters,What?  I don't understand ...
jennifer,Outside of Pleasantville ... What's at the end of Main Street?
miss peters,"Oh, Mary Sue. You should know the answer to that. The end of Main Street is just the beginning again."
david,Wow.
coach,That's it men. Keep it up. Big game tomorrow.
biff, Hi ya Bud.
bud,Hi ya Biff.
biff,Can I ask you a question?
bud,Sure.
biff,"Well ... If I was to ask your sister ... What I mean is, if I was to go up to Mary Sue ..."
david,Oh God! Are we in that episode?
biff,What?
david,I don't believe it.
biff,What's the matter?
david,"You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ..."
biff,Yeah ... How'd you know?
david," Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ..."
biff, She won't go out with me?
david,I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
biff,I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
david," Look, I'm sure we'll work something out. I'll talk to her or something."
jennifer,No way.
david,"One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack."
jennifer,It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
david,What?
jennifer,I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
david,What were you doing in a library?
jennifer,I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!
david,JENNIFER!
jennifer,"Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ..."
david,"Jen, listen ..."
jennifer," I like--really need a cigarette, too."
david, I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
jennifer,"You really think anybody's gonna, like, notice if I don't have a chocolate malt with this guy."
peggy jane, You won't believe what we just heard.
lisa anne,Biff Martin's going to ask you out.
betty jean,And that's not all ...
peggy jane,"No, that's not all ..."
jennifer,You sure I'm supposed to wear this?
jennifer, I could like kill a guy with these things.
david,It's in your closet.
jennifer, I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
david,He won't notice anyway.
jennifer,What do you mean?
david,They don't notice that kind of thing.
jennifer,So what's the point?
david,Jen please ...
jennifer,He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
david,Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
david,Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
david,What's wrong?
david, Yeah ...
david,I'm sorry.
david,I understand.
biff,Oh. Mary Sue ...
david," Peppermint shake, chocolate soda, two orders of fries and a split?"
david, What?
david,Listen to me!
david,Have you cooked the burgers?
david,"Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along."
biff, I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
jennifer," Well ""gee whizz"" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me."
biff,"I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ..."
jennifer,Really Biff? The keenest?
biff,Oh yeah.
jennifer, Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
biff,"Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll have my usual cheeseburger and a cherry coke."
jennifer,"Oh, I dunno Bud. Guess I'll just have a salad and an Evian Water."
biff,"See the whole time we were in civics together, I really wanted to sit next to you--but you were always sitting between Peggy Jane and Lisa Anne."
jennifer,"Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?"
biff,"Hunh?  Oh, right ..."
jennifer,"Oh, gosh no."
biff,"I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?"
jennifer,Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
jennifer,Jesus Chirist ...
girl's voices," ""Did he give it to you ... Did he give it to you ... I bet he gave it to her ... Did he give it to you?"""
jennifer, I don't think he knows how.
lisa anne,I bet he's gonna take her to Lover's Lane.
peggy jane,I bet he is. I bet he is.
betty jean,I bet he's even gonna hold her hand!
david," If you need anything, I'll be right over there."
jennifer," Gee whiz ""Bud"", what could we possibly need when we have each other?"
biff, Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
jennifer,You want to get out of here?
biff,What?
jennifer,You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
biff, But where would we go?
jennifer, ... Lover's Lane.
biff, Lover's Lane!
jennifer,Yeah. Lover's Lane. You up for it?
jennifer,C'mon. Let's go.
david,NOOOOOO!
david,YOU CAN'T DO THIS JENNIFER! HE DOESN'T EXIST! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T EXIST!
biff,Sure is pretty.
jennifer, Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
biff,To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
jennifer,"Oh, Biff. You can ""pin"" me any time you want to."
biff,"Oh, that's silly Mary Sue. How could you possibly pin me?"
betty,Bud?
george,"Son, what's wrong?"
david,Have you seen Mary Sue?
betty,Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
david," No, I ... I was just ... worried about her."
george, That's IF she can learn to bake.
betty,"Oh, George ..."
george,But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
biff, I think I better go home now Mary Sue ...
jennifer, ... Why?
biff, I think ... I might be ill ...
jennifer,"It's s'posed to happen, Biff."
biff,It is?
jennifer,Trust me ...
david, Oh no ... I'm fine.
betty,How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
david,I'm fine.
betty,Now who could that be.
david,Oh hi!
david,"Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early."
david,Yeah ...
david,Yeah ...
betty,Hello Bill.
david," Well, look, thanks for coming by. I ... really appreciate it."
jennifer,Well gee thanks Biff. I had a really wonderful time.
biff,... Me too.
jennifer, Hello Mr. Johnson.
david, What did you do to him?
jennifer, Nothing.
david,"What do you mean ""nothing?"" That's not nothing. That's ..."
jennifer,"Relax ""Bud."" We had a really nice time.  ... Now I'm really tired and we gotta get up early for school in the morning so ..."
david, Oh no ...
coach,Come on men. Let's go. Big game next week.
david,Oh my God ...
david,"You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you."
jennifer,"So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy."
david,You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
jennifer,"Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you?  You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before."
peggy jane," ""MS"". How you doin'?"
jennifer,"Kewl ""PJ"". How you doin'?"
peggy jane," ""Kewl."""
david,You have no right to do this.
jennifer,Well if I don't who will?
david,They're happy like this.
jennifer,"David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?"
david,I just don't think we have the right to ...
jennifer,"David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be ""attractive."" They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better."
david,They don't have that kind of potential.
jennifer,Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
boy,Wow. What kind of gum is that?
jennifer,I gotta go. I'm meeting Biff at the flagpole.
david,What'll it be?
biff," Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke."
jennifer,Me too. Sounds swell.
david, Really? It seems so fattening.
david," Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ..."
david,C'mere.
david,What did you say?
david,What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
david,Just listen to me ...
david,Forget about that!
david,"Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway."
david, So they can have their hamburgers!
david, ... What's that?
david, Wow ... That's pretty good ...
david,I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
david,Yeah.
gus,Have they ever lost before?
george,Basketball? No they sure haven't.
bob,"Just feels ""wrong"", that's all."
third patron,"Maybe that's where they get that saying, ""can't win 'em all."""
gus,"Yeah. That's a good point, Ralph. They do have that saying."
bob,"But they do win 'em all, Gus. They've always won 'em all."
gus,"Well, yeah. That's true too."
marge, ... He said it would clear up on its own if she just stayed away from fried foods and sweets ...
betty,Well that makes sense.
marge,"Except it's spread to her lips now too. Oh, I don't know."
mary," And you say it's just ""red?"""
marge,"Well--like red, only ... ""redder."""
mary,"Hunh. I know what you mean. That's like the front of Bill Johnson's shop. I was going by it the other day and it looked green only ""greener."""
marge, Have you seen him lately? The man doesn't look like himself. I was getting my sewing machine fixed across the street and he was sitting in the window of his shop just staring. Wasn't looking at anything in particular--just staring off into space.
mary,That is strange.
marge,"Betty, it's your bid."
betty,Uh ... Seven hearts.
betty,Mary Sue?
jennifer,Yeah?
betty,Can I ask you a question?
jennifer,Sure.
betty,What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
jennifer, What do you mean?
betty,"Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?"
jennifer,Yeah ...  That--and ...
betty,What?
jennifer,It doesn't matter.
betty,No. I want to know.
jennifer, ... Sex.
betty,Ah.
jennifer,You sure you want to know this?
betty,Yes.
jennifer,Okay.
jennifer,You okay?
betty,Yes ...  It's just that ...
jennifer, What?
betty,Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.
jennifer," Well, Mom ... there's ways to ""enjoy"" yourself without Dad."
george,Sweetie? You coming to bed?
betty, Yeah ... I'm just going to take a bath first.
david,Oh my God!
david,Jesus Christ ...
david,FIRE! FIRE!
david, FIRE ... FIRE ...
david,Right here!
fire chief,Where is it?
david,Here! Grab this nozzle.
fireman,But where's the ...
david,Just grab it!
fireman,Whoa!  So that's what these do.
bob,... And with great appreciation from the citizens of Pleasantville ...
bob,"I am pleased to present You with this special commendation, from the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce!"
girl's voice,Hi Bud ...
margaret,That was sure swell ...
david,"Oh. Thanks, Margaret."
margaret, I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
david," Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey."
margaret,No. I baked them for you.
david,No. You baked them for Whitey.
margaret, No. I baked them for you.
david,Um ... thanks.
margaret,See ya.
jennifer, I had nothing to do with that fire.
david, It's okay.
jennifer,Not directly anyhow ...
david,It's fine.
jennifer, Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
david,Sure.
various kids,Swell ...
boy,How'd you know about the fire?
david,What?
boy,How'd you know how to put it out and all?
david,Well--where I used to live ... That's just what firemen did.
boy,And where's that?
david, Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
boy,What's outside of Pleasantville?
david,Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
boy,What is it?
david,It's really not important.
david, Well ... There are some places where the road doesn't go in a circle. There are some places where it keeps on going.
margaret, Keeps going ...
david,Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
david,... What?
boy," ""It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."""
david, I thought the books were blank?
jennifer,They were.
david,The pages filled in?
jennifer,"But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther."
david," Well, yeah ... I do."
margaret, So how does it end?
david,Well--see ... they're both running away--Huck and the slave ... And ... They go up the river ... But--in trying to get free they sort of see that they're free already.
david,Hunh?  See--Holden Caulfield is like this really lonely kid...
gus,I don't know Phil. It's pretty strange.
phil,I'll say it's strange. Gettin' stranger.
burt,Oughtta be havin' an ice cream soda. That's where they oughtta be.
george,Want some bridge mix?
bob,"Oh, no thanks ..."
george,Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
bob,I'm fine--but thank you.
george,"""Changes."""
bob, Did you hear about Bill Miller?
george, No. What?
bob,Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
george,One of those ... big beds?
bob,I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
george,... How?
big bob,Said he didn't want to do it anymore. Just took off his apron in the middle of an order. Mrs. Thompson had her groceries spread all over the counter ... Took 'em four hours to sort the whole thing out.
george,Holy cow.
big bob,"George, everyone likes you."
george,Oh well ...
bob,No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
george, Thank you very much.
bob,"And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it."
george,No. Of course not.
bob, And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
george, Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
bob," Why don't you start by saying ""yes,"" and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs."
george,Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
david,I'll get her.
david, Are you okay?
betty, What am I going to do?
david,It's okay. It's alright.
betty, I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
david,Have you got any make up?
betty,In my handbag.
david,Okay--first we'll dry you out a little.
betty, What?
david,Looks just like it did.
betty,And they won't be able to tell?
david, No ... They won't be able to tell.
betty, What?
david,It's fine.
betty,Thank you.
david, Sure.
david, Hi.

david,Open it.
david,What's wrong?
david,"Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ..."
david,Hi.
margaret, Oh ... Hi.
david," Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ..."
margaret, Sure ... Where would we go?
david, ... Lover's Lane?
david, Sorry ...
david,"""Oh when the Saints ... Go Marching in ..."""
david, ... Hi.

david,"Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ..."

david,Re-runs?
david,"Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just ""cookies"" after all ..."
david,"Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?"

jennifer,Yeah ...
david,Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
jennifer,No. She really liked you.
david,You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
jennifer,Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
david,Wow.
jennifer,Can I ask you a question?
david,Yes.
jennifer,How come I'm still in black and white?
david, What?
jennifer,Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
david,"Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ..."
jennifer, What?
margaret,Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
david,Oh ... Right.
david,Wow.
david,What's that smell?
margaret,Aren't these great?

david,Oh. don't know ... It's different.
margaret,How?
david,Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...

margaret,Real rain?
david,Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
margaret,What do we do?
david, We'll just put up the top.
margaret,What top?
david,It's fine. Come on.
jennifer,Cool ...
george," Honey, I'm home ..."

george, Where's my dinner?
bob,What happened?
bob,Are you alright?  What is it?
george, Rain.
bob, Real rain?
george," Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said ""Honey. I'm home."""
george,... Only no one was there.
bob, ... It's gonna be fine George.
gus,What do we do Bob?
bob,"Well--we'll be safe for now--thank goodness we're in a bowling alley-- but if George here doesn't get his dinner, any one of us could be next. It could be you Gus, or you Burt, or even you Phil ..."
phil,Couple of hours.
bob,"Gus, why don't you get a bunch of kids from the basketball team to help you put them up on lamposts and tree trunks ..."
betty,But I really should get home.
betty,Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
betty,Like a drum.
margaret, Oh my God ...
jennifer, Oh my God ...
bob, Oh my GOD!
betty,I told you where I was.
george,All night?
betty,I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
george, I was in a bowling-alley.
betty,"I told you, George. I'm not going."
george, Sure you are.
betty,No I'm not.
george,It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
betty,I don't want to put on some make up ...
george, It goes away ... It'll go away.
betty, I don't want it to go away.
george," You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table."
betty, No I'm not sweetie.
george,Where are you gonna go?
betty,I'm gonna go now.
george,"Betty, don't go out there like that! They'll see you!  They'll SEE you!"
bob,This was found over in Dave Murphy's trash can. There were four of them like this ...
bob,Jane Davidson found these in her son's laundry basket.
david, I got you something.
margaret,It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
david,It was a prop for the school play ...
margaret,Can I open it?
david,Sure ...
driver,Hello Bud ...
david, Hello Whitey.
whitey, Hello Margaret.
margaret,Hello Whitey ...
whitey," Hey Bud, how come you're not at the town meeting right now?"
david, How come you're not?
whitey,Oh. We're s'posed to go out and let everybody know about it. See.
david,Why don't you guys just get the hell out of here.
whitey,"Oh, okay, Bud. We'll do that."
david,It's fine ... It doesn't mean anything.
woman,Ed McFadden's got a blue front door.
ed mcfadden,It's always been blue!
woman,Not that blue!
man,There's a big tree turning orange in Joe Baker's front yard!
bob,"People, people ... I think we all know what's going on here."
bob,"Obviously certain ""changes"" have been happening. Up until now, things in Pleasantville have always been-- well ... ""Pleasant."" And, recently, certain things have become ... ""Un-Pleasant."" Now it seems to me the first thing we have to do is to separate out the things that are pleasant, from the things that are ""Un-Pleasant."""
david, Oh--well ...
david, What do you mean?
david,"Look--it just sort of ""happened"" ..."
david,I had nothing to do with that.
david,Look ...
david, ... Only if they mean it.
david, I didn't do anything wrong.
david,Why?
david,No you're not.
david, I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
david, I'm going to leave now.
david, Come on!
david,Get out of here!
david,Are you alright?
david, Come on.
david,Oh my God.
betty, No. Let's get out of here.
david,We should be okay up here.
david, We better go.
margaret,Where are they?
david,I'm not sure.
david,Oh my God.
jennifer,Don't! Just let go.
biff,"It's better, Mary Sue."
jennifer,"I said, NO!  ... I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire ..."
david, It's okay. It's me.
david,Let's go inside.
david,Hello?
david,"Well he's right. Come on. Let's turn these booths back up. ""Mary Sue"", why don't you help me slide this in front of the door. We'll be okay in here."
bob,This is not the answer people.
bob," ""ONE: All public disruption and acts of vandalism are to cease immediately."""
bob,"""TWO: All citizens of Pleasantville are to treat one another in a courteous and ""pleasant"" manner ..."""
lisa anne,"""Courteous and Pleasant manner."" That doesn't sound too bad."
david," ""THREE: The area commonly known as Lover's Lane as well as the Pleasantville Public Library shall be closed until further notice."""
various kids," ""Oh my gosh ... No ..."""
david,"""FIVE: There shall be no public sale of umbrellas or preparation for inclement weather of any kind."""
boy,Hey. This thing works.
buddy holly,Well all the things that you say and do Make me want to be with you-oo-oo ...
lisa anne, Turn that off!
david,Sure you are.
buddy holly,The little things that you say and do Make we want to be with you-oo-oo ... RAVE ON! It's a crazy feeling ... RAVE ON! It's got me reelin' ...
david, Stick together till you get off Main Street.
david,It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
david,Maybe I have an idea.
bob, Did you do this?
david, Yes I did.
bob,Do you know that it's illegal?
david, Yes I do.
bob,BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
david,Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
bob,You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
david,Still doesn't make it right.
bob,Dan! Arrest them!
bob,What do you mean!?
dan,"Well, I never had to do it before."
bob,You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
dan," Oh. guess I could do that, then."
david," C'mere, Dan. I'll help you."
dan,There's someone to see you Bud.
david,I thought it might be you.
david,I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
david,Why?
david, Why don't you just take me back without it?
david,"So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ..."
david,I'm sorry. I can't do that.
david,They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
david," I don't know ... Three, four weeks."
david,I'm going on trial tomorrow?
david, There's worse places.
bob,"Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta."
david,Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
bob,"We prefer to keep these proceedings as ""pleasant"" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary."
david,Well--it was dark out ...
bob,"Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?"
david,It was accessible to everyone.
bob,Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
david,I think I've got something to say.
bob,Very well ...
david,"I think I know why you're doing this. I mean, I understand why you're doing this. I used to feel the same way. I used to want this place to stay just the way it was. I never wanted it to change ..."
bob, The basketball team?
david,Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
bob,Okay--that's enough!
david,I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
bob,You're not allowed to lie.
david,I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
david,What color is that hedge of yours?
david,"No, not that hedge. The other one."
david,The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
bob,"I said, that's enough!"
david,Alright. Dad ...
george, Yes Bud.
david, Don't you miss her?
david,"I mean, of course you do, but it isn't just the cooking or the cleaning that you miss--it's something else, isn't it ..."
big bob," Okay, that's IT!!!"
david, Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
bob, YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
david,Why am I out of order?
bob,BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
david,Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
bob,THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
david,But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
bob, It's not in ME.
david,Oh sure it is.
bob,No it isn't.
david, What do you want to do to me right now?
big bob,That's not going to happen!
david,But it could happen.
big bob,No it couldn't!
jennifer,Uch ... I am like gonna hurl ...
david,Are you sure?
jennifer,I told you. I'm like positive.
david,This thing works. We could go home right now.
jennifer,I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
jennifer,Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
david, Honestly ... no.
jennifer,Right here.
david,And you're sure about this?
jennifer,"I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old."
david,I'll come back and check on you in a month.
jennifer,You're like the coolest brother in the world.
margaret,You're gonna forget about me.
david,No I won't. I swear.
margaret, I like calling you David.
david,I like it too.
david,You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
david,It's beautiful.
betty, I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
david,Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
betty, I had to say goodbye.
david,I won't.
betty, And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
david, ... It's a pretty short trip.
betty,"I'm so proud of you, Bud."
david,Thanks ... I love you.
betty,I love you too.
david,You better stand back a little.
