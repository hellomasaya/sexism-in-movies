Speaker,Dialogue
blakeney,In CALAMY Out.
blakeney,In. It was here. The line is in.
calamy,It was there. It was out. Out
blakeney,In. Tell him Boyle. It was in I say.
hollar,Lights out!
crewmen,Watch there! Watch
watch captains,- Lifebuoy all's well! - Starboard gangway all's well! - Starboard bow all's well!
jack,How I do hate a lee shore
pullings,"You think we'll have long to wait? JACK  Intelligence reports had her leaving Boston on the 12th, that should put us at least a week ahead."
pullings,"She'll be in for a surprise, Sir."
jack,"In for a ""Surprise"". Now that's wit. ""In for a Surprise"". 'Pon my word I shall have to tell the Doctor."
pullings,"I'll try not to, Sir."
jack,"What do you have there, Stephen?"
stephen,The breastbone of a frigate bird. Do you remark its prodigious strength.
jack,"I do and I am not in the least surprised, for it reminds me of nothing so much as a ship under sail. See here the bowsprit. Here the mast, and here the backstays running aft."
stephen, Ten pounds sixteen ounces. I am preparing a paper for the Royal Society.
jack,"I was thinking when our business here is finished, we will have to put in to Recife for provisions. You may care to take a tour round the forests of Brazil, botanizing and collecting specimens. An anaconda or two. A giant cassowary."
stephen,"I should like it of all things, Jack. Thankyou."
jack,"Killick! Killick there! Strong coffee, and light along my topcoat."
quartermaster,Six bells and all's well.
calamy,"Four knots, Sir."
bonden,"Oi reckon as she's liftin' Sir, if you feels like putting your ad down."
vincent,Starboard gangway ahoy.
hollom,"What is it, Vincent?"
vincent,I heard something. A bell.
hollom,Native fisherman perhaps.  Mr. Calamy!
hollom,Well. It can't have been a reef marker.
calamy,Enemy on the larboard bow! Beat to quarters!
jack,Where away?
calamy,"Not two miles distant, Sir."
jack,Mr. Hollom?
hollom,"I saw nothing, nor heard anything either. Shall I ask them men to stand down?"
jack,Lie down! Everybody lie down!
jack,"Run out the guns! Marines to the tops, and get that wounded man below!"
davies,Shot. There's no shot!
jack,Note the time Mr. Watt.
pullings,"She's out of our range, Sir!"
jack,"Closer, Mr. ALLEN. You must lay me alongside her at pistol-shot."
pullings,Fire on the uproll.
old sponge, Witchcraft!
doudle,Never seen the like of it
pullings,Damn and blast you! See to your guns! Fire high! Fire for the masts and rigging!
stephen,"More sand on the floor, Mr. Higgins!"
davies,Wood and Lead! Mr Nagel! Mr Lamb!!
davies,Orlop! We're holed!
calamy,Davies! Get those bodies overboard!  Mr. Hollom sir!
jemmy ducks,"Aye, sir!"
blakeney,More shot! More cartridge!
jack,...wait WAIT! And FIRE!
jack,Belay there ye poxed son of a whore!
mowett,"You must go below, Sir, you must let me help you below!"
pullings,It's the rudder.
bonden, It's shot away below the waterline!
stephen,Why are we not firing?
faster doudle,No steerage.
nehemiah slade,We're fish in a barrel
allen,"He's coming about, Sir."
mowett,Should I strike the colours?
allen,I'm afraid there's nothing else for it.
jack,Damned if there ain't. We'll tow her.
pullings,"Sail trimmers away, Warley, make what sail you can!"
jack,Stern-chasers to fire when she's in range!
mowett,Fire!
warley,"Sharp now with that fancy-line! To the clew line from the reef points, Cully, double up and run her back again!"
pullings,She's gaining on us.
jack,"Start the water, carronades over the side."
jack,Pull! Pull for your lives.
jack,"Quiet now. No calls, no shouts. Mr. ALLEN, signal the men in the boats to head due east."
bonden, Starboard haul. And stroke! Stroke!
pullings,He's beating inshore.
jack,Keep rowing
allen,"I believe we've lost her, Sir."
jack,Pass the word to ship oars
lamb,"Three feet of water in the hold, Sir, but the pumps are keeping it from gaining."
jack,"Very good, Mr. Lamb."
jack, What's the butchers bill?
stephen,"Six dead, thirteen wounded."
jack, Later.
jack,Mr. Blakeney?
blakeney,"Just a broken arm, Sir."
stephen,I will do everything possible. I know you were close to his father.
jack,Its a scratch.
stephen,I will tell you if its a scratch or not. Sit down.
jack,How did he find us Stephen? Seven weeks sailing and he happened in darkness on our exact position. Its uncanny. He really is a phantom
stephen,"Unless she was alerted to our presence, and looking for us. JACK Tosh. How could that be?"
stephen,"The French have their spies, in Britain as elsewhere."
stephen,"I am saying do not imagine it was a lone privateer who did this to us. He is working for Napoleon himself, with access to all that tyrant commands, overtly and covertly. So do not let defeat weigh too heavily upon you."
allen,"...Call her a frigate? Ha! You ask me she's no more a frigate than a painted Dutchman. More like a ship of the line, a two-decker more'n a frigate."
mowett,One does wonder what manner of hull she has. Our balls seemed to bounce right off her.
pullings,She had the weather-gauge and long eighteens which could hit us beyond our effective range. That's the sum of it
allen,"And   40 guns to our 28, I counted the muzzle flashes."
pullings,"It was an unfair match, no dishonor in defeat no dishonor at all."
allen," Well, we can patch up our main and mizzen the foresail is too far gone so we'll bend our spare."
pullings,Sir.
allen,"At Port Royal we can haul her into dry- dock, and hopefully get her home without..."
jack,We're not going home.
allen,"With respect, Captain, she could be half- way to Cape Horn by the time we're repaired and underway."
jack, Then there's not a moment to lose.
davies,Can we catch her is the question. And if we do what's different? She'll just hold us off with them long eighteens til she sends us all to the bottom. All for what?
doudle,"I'll tell you for what, matey. She's a privateer, loaded with all the gems of Araby. Think of the gold. Think of the prize-money."
hollar,Hoi there! You men jump to it!
hollar,Heave. And heave. Handsomely now. One long pull. Belay!
jack,"Have her placed along the gunwale for now, Mr. Hollar, and the guns moved to that side also."
faster doudle,All clear below!
jack,"Damn this wind, Mr. Pullings! The Acheron will be making a hundred and fifty miles a day in this."
pullings,"Aye, but hugging the coast, and stopping to board the odd merchantman"
lamb,Down. Down. Stop.
old sponge, The smaller bit. No. That bit there.
blakeney,No. No. Not through my nose!
calamy,Its alright. William. You were dreaming.
calamy,"You know old Joe, always telling [ ] stories."
blakeney,Is it true though? [    ] About the last stitch?
calamy,"Come on, you'll be stitching me in mine first."
calamy, Nor any other part of you.
calamy,"Is it mending, sir?"
stephen,"No, I'm afraid it will not do."
blakeney,No. Mamma. Mamma.
stephen,It is the laudanum speaking. You will be a regular Nelson.
blakeney,Peter? Is that you? I dreamed they cut my arm off.
calamy,You would have died else.
stephen,"No, that is just blood. These are his brains."
slade,"Physician he is, not one of your common surgeons."
faster doudle,"Cured Prince Billy of the marthambles and the strong fives, wouldn't look at you for under ten guineas on land."
davies,"[   ] Knows his birds and beasts too boyo, show him a beetle and he'll tell you what it's thinking."
jack,"Let us be off, Mr. Allen!"
allen,Weigh anchor! All hands to make sail. Mr Hollom!
hollom,Bear a hand there you fellows!
mowett,"Up and down Sir, thick and dry for weighing."
hollar,"Cheerly there in the foretop, our William! T'garnsl sheets! Hands to the braces!"
jack,"Speed, Mr. Boyle"
boyle,"Ten and a half knots, Sir."
killick,"Here we go again: scrape, scrape, screech, screech and never a tune you could dance to, not if you were drunk as Davey's sow."
stephen,"Is that one I know, or are we breaking new ground?"
jack,I am trying to remember that air they played all those years ago at the Governors house in Port Mahon. You remember When we first met. Corelli if I'm not mistaken.
stephen,"If that is your ""A"" you are very much so. This is A."
jack,Or Locatelli. pom pom pom pom
stephen,All I remember is you being unable to sit in your seat the entire performance.
jack,"Aye and you practising apon that poor bishop with your ""puddings athwart the starboard Gumbrils"" or some such arrant nonsense."
stephen," No. That was off Toulon, during the blockade. At our first meeting they played this:"
jack,No. No. Entirely off the mark.   pom-pom- POM I have now
stephen, Or was it something like this....
jack,And pitch 'em up! It's spars and rigging we want!
mowett,"Three minutes ten, Sir."
jack,Not good enough! We must fire three broadsides to her two. Again!
jack,"'Spitfire', hop to it."
pullings,Again!
jack,Out Tompions... Run out your guns... Prime.
mowett,"One minute forty-nine, Sir!"
jack,Killick? Killick there. KILLICK appears.
killick,"Which it's, Soused Hoggs-Face."
jack,Aah! My favorite.
pullings,"With your permission, Sir, Mr. Mowett has composed a short poem in honour of our mission."
jack,"Let's hear it, Mr. Mowett."
mowett,"Our brotherhood, some old, some new. In blood baptized, in strength renewed. In purpose unified and true. All thoughts of home forsaken. Where duty leads us, there we go. Nor rest nor comfort shall we know. Until the unrepentant foe, is boarded sunk or taken"
all," Aye! Capital! Well said! Hear him, hear him! 'Sunk or taken'..."
jack,Aye and when we do take her we shall give her to Tom Pullings as his first command. If he don't die before then. Bumpers up Tom
allen, 'To wives and sweethearts'.
all,'To wives and sweethearts'.
pullings,And may they never meet.
jack,"Lord Nelson? Yes. I had the honour of serving under him at the Nile.  In fact I dined with him twice, and he spoke to me on both occasions."
mowett, To Lord Nelson.
all,Lord Nelson!
jack,"You see those two weevils, Doctor?"
stephen,I do.
jack,Which would you choose?
jack,But suppose you had to choose?
stephen,"Then I would choose the right-hand weevil, it has a perceptible advantage in both length and breadth."
jack,There I have you. You are completely dished. Don't you know in the Navy you must always choose 'the lesser of two weevils'?
allen,'Pon my life. He who would pun would pick a pocket. De not smoke it doctor?
stephen, Sure there would be some poor thin barren minds that would catch at such a paltry clench.
plaice,"""...And the righteous shall inherit the earth."""
bonden,You hear that. He said something. Joe spoke! Say something else Joe JOE Handy with that gasket
bonden, He spoke doctor. Joe plaice spoke
midshipmen,Our captain was very good to us. He dipped his prick in phosphorus. It shed a light all through the night. And steered us through the Bosphorus.
hollom,For we've received orders to sail for Old England. Perhaps we shall never more see you again His singing is appreciated by STEPHEN on the quarterdeck.
stephen,What a wonderfully true voice Mr. Hollom does possess.
orrage,"Come all you thoughtless young men, A warning take by me, And never leave your happy homes to sail the raging sea."
allen,"This one's by Colnett, Sir. He travelled with Captain Cook and carried a pair of Arnott's chronometers."
killick,"Couple of the men to see you, Sir."
jack, Show them in. The door opens to reveal NAGEL and WARLEY carrying something.
nagel,"It were Warley's idea, Sir."
warley,"I thought she were familiar like, then I remembered where I'd seen her - in Boston, during the Peace."
jack,[   ] In Boston?
nagel,"If you look here, Sir. One side opens up."
warley,"Mister Nagel here done it just like I seen her - a third layer 'tween the outer and inner ribbing - diagonal bracing, see?"
jack,Just like the U.S. Constitution - our 12 pounders couldn't penetrate except at close range.
killick," Which I was saving for Saluting Day, Sir."
jack,"Rouse it up, Killick, and a bottle for Mr. ALLEN and me. Let us live whilst we're alive!"
stephen,He says they were chased for three days till they finally our-ran her. Forty gun French privateer headed due south.
jack,Capital. Thank him and let us be off.
stephen,"A Spanish farewell. ""May no new thing arrive."" New things being generally by their nature bad."
blakeney,Do you have a manual of exercises sir.
stephen,Exercises?
blakeney,"Physical exercises, to make the left arm as powerful as the right once was."
stephen,"I think that will happen with usage, at least to a certain extent."
blakeney,"But not completely. I will never be whole again, will I?"
stephen,No but you will adapt to your new situation
blakeney,You know my father was a great fighting captain. It was always his expectation I would follow in his footsteps. I worry that with this arm I will now be good for nothing but book learning and philosophy.
stephen,"Ah. Like me you mean. BLAKENEY  I cannot use a sextant, cannot tie a knot or climb the rigging. Cannot even dress myself. What chance to I have now of even making first lieutenant."
stephen,"You have every chance. You hear me every chance. Only the other day I heard the captain singing your praises. Your courage, your fortitude in battle, your skill at logarithms and double elevations whatever they may be. And when you are rated lieutenant you shall have someone to tie your bootlaces for you. Aye and help you with your jacket. Here take my handkerchief. I believe we are summonsed to dinner."
warley,Sail on the larboard bow!
jack,Where away?
pullings,"Hull down, two points off the larboard beam."
jack,Set studdingsails and top gallants. Then wet the sails and have the idlers placed along the rail.
blakeney,"Is it him, Sir?"
jack,"Touch wood, Mr. Blakeney. And I fancy she plans to out-run us. Ask Dr. Maturin to join us, he loves a good chase."
mowett,Lifelines fore and aft!
jack,"Speed, Mr. Calamy?"
calamy,"Twelve knots, Sir!"
jemmy ducks,"We're cracking on, eh?"
faster doudle,We'll be cracking off presently if he doesn't watch it.
slade,"No, he knows this ship. He knows what she can take."
pullings,We can just see her topsails. She's made her turn westwards.
lamb,"I can't vouch for the mizzen Sir, not round Cape Horn. JACK I'll not lose her now. Set a course westwards."
jack,"Mr Hollar, rig preventer backstays. Warps and light hawsers to the mastheads."
pullings,"What, Sir?"
higgins,You reckon Captain will keep chasing him 'round the Horn with every stitch of canvas flying?
davies,I reckon he'd chase him to the gates of hell if he has to.
plaice,And that's where we're all going if he doesn't take in sail.
jack,Strike the topgallants.
bonden,Man overboard!
jack,"Swim for the wreckage, man!"
bonden,She's broaching!
pullings,"It's acting as a sea-anchor! We must cut it loose, Sir!"
jack,Axes!
killick,He's been at it again.
black bill,Who's that then?
killick,The Jonah.
black bill,What Jonah?
stephen,"The deaths in actual battle are the easiest.  Warley was a casualty of war, as surely as if a French ball had taken him."
stephen,"You know that I wear two hats on every voyage. I am the captains particular friend and supporter, but also I am the ships doctor in which later capacity I am party to...."
jack, On the contrary. I insist on it.
stephen,"There is talk below decks of turning back. Or rather that we should have turned back some weeks ago. Of course the men would follow ""Lucky Jack"" anywhere, and usually in the confident expectation of victory. But that of course is the problem."
jack,What is the problem?
stephen,"That you are not accustomed to defeat Jack. That you have taken it too personally. That chasing this larger, faster ship, with its long guns, is beginning to smack of pride 'which goeth before destruction'?"
jack,"It's not pride nor anything like it, it's a question of duty."
stephen,"'Duty', ah yes. The naval signal for end of discussion."
jack,"You can be as 'satiric' as you like, Stephen, but I have my orders. She is attacking our whalers. For why? Without whales we have no boot polish, nor any soap, nor oil for our lamps, not to oil our sabres and muskets. Destroying our whalers could win the war for Napoleon. Which is why we must catch this Acheron. As a man of learning surely you can see that."
stephen,At whatever the cost?
jack,"Any whatever cost I choose to pay. And I will calculate that myself, Stephen without reference to your friends in the ward room."
hollom,Cast off.
jack,"We'll have to go further south, get around this bloody west wind."
pullings,How far south?
jack,"As far as is necessary, Mr. Pullings. The sixtieth parallel if need be."
mowett,Then we upon the globes last verge shall go to view the ocean leaning on the sky from thence our rolling neighbours we shall know and on the hidden world securely pry!
hollar,"Rise and shine! Show a leg there, tumble up, tumble up - sleepers awake!"
jack,Praise be. At last.
stephen,Pray what is there to celebrate?
jack,"We have made our turn northward, Doctor. We are headed back toward the sun... The officers give a slightly ragged cheer."
killick,Which I was just coming.
jack,"Gentlemen, I give you... our destination."
stephen,The Galapagos Islands.
pullings,"'Pon my word so it is. Look: here's Narborough, Chatham and Hood..."
jack,"That's where the whalers are, ain't it Mr Allen. So that's where the Acheron will be headed."
jack,Best bowers chipped... Lot of rust on these forechains... black strake needs another coat.
killick,That engagement off Recife: his whole gun crew killed and him not a mark on him. Soon as he went up the mizzen mast Warley falls. And whose watch was it when we lost our wind?
stephen,"A mere thimbleful, Corporal, for scientific purposes only."
stephen,Show me where these Doldrums lie?
jack,"Stephen. Will we never make a sailor of you? The doldrums is a condition, not a region. But you tend to strike 'em here...  ...between the trades, and the sou'easterlies. I hope the Acheron is having it as bad as we are."
stephen,"Assuming he is heading for the Galapagos, and not some other point in all this vastness?"
jack,Come. I'd have thought you'd be delighted to go there. It is said to be a natural paradise
stephen,In truth I'd be delighted with the merest guano stained rock provided it didn't sway beneath my feet
jack,"Well, we'll take on food and water once we're there, and as compensation for not having put ashore in Brazil I pledge that during that time, several days at least, you can wander at will, catching bugs and beetles to your heart's delight. You will be the first naturalist to set foot on the islands. That is my solemn promise"
stephen,"I accept, provided the men have not mutinied and thrown us all overboard before we get there."
jack,Mutiny? No. They are already counting their share of the prize money.
stephen,Another week of this and they shall gladly give it up for a glass of clean water.
jack,"Ach, Stephen. Stephen. Pray stop your bellyacheing. We shall have rain presently, and if not we shall damned well tow ourselves out of this."
hollom,Stroke. Stroke...
bonden,M-a-s-t... mast
stephen,"Is that man completely mad?  Mr. Howard, a petrel is not good eating!"
howard,"Were you never a man for sporting, Doctor? Why you could shoot all day in these waters with two men loading!"
calamy,Blakeney...
williamson,Rye...
calamy,Swift...
williamson,Boyle...
calamy," All right, come on Addison."
williamson,It's tails. We attack.
blakeney,Ow ow ow!
williamson,Yield.
calamy,Let go of him.
williamson,Yield!!
calamy,"It's just powder. There wasn't a ball in it, just powder."
blakeney,No.
calamy,What's wrong? I saved you.
blakeney,I didn't need to be saved.
jack,"Master at arms! Take that man below and clap him in irons. Mr. Pullings, defaulters at six bells."
jack,The man pushed past you without making his obedience. And yet you said nothing.
hollom,"No, Sir, I intended to but the right words just didn't..."
jack,'The right words'? He failed to salute you. It's deliberate insubordination.
hollom,"They don't like me, Sir."
jack,"They what? Speak up, man!"
hollom,"I've tried to get to know the men a bit, Sir, be friendly like, but they've taken a set against me. Always whispering when I go past, giving me looks. But, I'll set that to rights, be tougher on them from now on."
jack,"You can't make 'friends' with the foremast jacks, they'll despise you in the end. Nor do you need be a tyrant. It's leadership they want, strength, respect."
hollom,"I'm very sorry, Sir. JACK You're what twenty-three, twenty-four?"
hollom, Twenty-five next Friday.
jack,You've failed to pass for lieutenant twice. You can't spend the rest of your life as a midshipman.
hollom,"I'll try harder, Sir."
jack,"Well, it's an unfortunate business, Hollom. Damned unfortunate."
jack,"'Article Thirty-Six. All other crimes not capital, committed by any person or persons in the fleet... shall be punished according to the laws, and customs, of the sea.'  Mr. Nagel, you're an old man-of-war's man and yet you failed to salute an officer. You knew what you were doing. Have you anything to say in your defence?"
nagel,"No, Sir."
jack,Have his officers anything to say for him?
hollar,"Seized up, Sir."
jack,"One dozen. Bosun's mate, do your duty."
jack,Red hell...
stephen,"I was merely remarking that you have always prided yourself on not being a flogging captain and this... JACK I am not a ""flogging captain"". I have not once rigged the grating on this voyage, not once in twelve thousand miles. Besides, I wager you will find a deal more brutality on land."
stephen,I'm not a party to it on land.
jack,"Well you are party to it on my ship. Men must be governed. Often not wisely I grant you, but there are hierarchies even in nature, as you've often said yourself."
stephen,Hierarchies. That is the excuse of every tyrant in history. Of Nero. Of Boneparte.
jack, Yes. Fine words I'm sure
stephen," ...We are not animals and I for one am opposed to authority, that egg of misery and oppression.."
jack,"Very fine words Stephen, but In these current circumstances, hard-work and firm discipline is what keeps our little wooden world together."
stephen,And grog I suppose.
jack,Of course. What of it? Of course they have their grog!
jack,The men will have their grog Stephen. It is part of the immemorial tradition of the service
stephen,"Well a shameful tradition it is too. To have them pressed from their homes, kept in a permanent state of dull inebriation."
jack,Stephen...
stephen,"...confined for months in a wooden prison, Never more than a few hours sleep and flogged when drunken idleness drives them to...."
stephen,I am stating plain facts
jack," Well I will not hear them! From you or anyone. You understand! Things are as they are for good or bad whether or not they have a place in your damned papist philosophy. If you are here to make music then sit down and play. If not be gone, for you have come to the wrong shop for anarchy!"
blakeney,"Are you all right, Hollom?"
calamy,He's not sick. He's useless. He's just dodging work.
howard,Doctor! The very man.
stephen,"Mr. Howard, let me beg you, if the men can't eat it or I can't dissect it, please do not shoot every creature you see."
killick,What did I tell you? The ship's accursed.
jack,"What is that abominable noise, for God's sake?"
pullings,"I have no idea, Sir."
mowett,"You don't think it's the Acheron, Sir?"
jack," The enemy cannot come on us without a wind, Mr. Mowett."
stephen,I'm sure I've never heard the like.
jack,[    ] Creature?
stephen,[ ] A manatee. A sea-elephant possibly. Though I have never known one with a cry like this.
jack,Bosun. Fire off some flares.
jack,"Sergeant, what the devil are you thinking of? Turn the glass and strike the bell."
mowett,Perhaps some poor shipwreck?
black bill,Duppies make that noise.
doudle,What's a duppie?
black bill,That Warley. Swallow by a fish. Spirit can't get out. Him duppie now.
slade,Captain don't even know what that noise be.
doudle,"Doctor neither, and he knows everything."
killick,"Joe here's got the most experience in these matters, and new brains to boot, let's hear it from Joe."
plaice,"It's the Jonah causing it. That howling thing is a signal to the Phantom-Ship. He's calling it up, don't you see? Every time he's on watch the ship appears. You wait and see, the ghost-ship will appear any time tonight, and take us all straight to the hot-place."
jack,You don't think...?
stephen,Mr Hollom. Sir. Try to contain yourself. Hold his head. Mr Hollom. Padeen
jack,Well?
stephen,There's nothing physically wrong with him. He thinks he's been cursed by the 0men.
jack,"Then he probably has been. Sailors will abide a great deal, but never a Jonah. It's like a white crow - the others peck it to death."
stephen,"A 'Jonah'? My God, you believe it too."
jack,I desired to save you the trouble of looking for a cure. No doubt it will all be sorted by the morning.
blakeney,Mr. Hollom! You gave me such a start. Are you better now?
hollom,"Much better, thank you."
blakeney,I think the creature is going away. HOLLOM I am sure of it.
blakeney,Man overboard!
jack,"The fact is, [   ] not all of us become the men we once hoped we might be. But we are all God's creatures. If some of us thought ill of Mr. Hollom, or spoke ill of him, or failed him in respect of fellowship, then we ask your forgiveness, Lord, and we ask for his."
bonden,Strike eight bells.
blakeney,"Give you joy, sir! We have raised the Galapagos!"
doudle,Wot? There must be wimmun. T'ain't natural.
stephen,How extraordinary.
blakeney,"What, sir?"
stephen,Those birds!
blakeney,The dragons don't seem to bother 'em.
stephen,"They are a type of iguana I should think, and therefore vegetarian. His telescope remains focussed on the cormorants. BLAKENEY is wholly absorbed in the iguanas."
blakeney,Will you catch one?
stephen,"Yes. Most certainly. And if we can, some eggs."
blakeney,I mean the great lizards.
stephen,Oh!
bonden,Ha! There's one going for a swim.
stephen,No. Iguanas are land animals.
bonden,Not these ones.
jack,All hands about ship!
nehemiah slade,"By your leave sir, by your leave."
hogg,"God bless you. Thank you, shipmates."
hogg,"We was coming back for fresh lines, hid in that inlet, yonder. Black-three master. Bit beamy and raised in the stern."
allen, No swearing on the quarterdeck.
jack," Go on. HOGG ...Then they burnt our bloody ship and headed off, bunch of fugging pirates."
jack,And her course?
hogg,Maybe a point south of west. Following the rest of the whaling fleet.
pullings,"Should we not take on fresh supplies, Sir? Those tortoises..."
stephen,Have you forgotten your promise?
jack," Subject to the requirements of the service, Stephen. I could not in all conscience delay for the sake of an iguano or a... giant peccary - interesting no doubt, but of no immediate application."
stephen,"Well perhaps there's an opportunity to serve both our objectives. As I understand it you mean to go round the end of this long island, then start your voyage. I could walk across it, be on the other side long before..."
stephen,"I see. So after all this time in your service I must simply be content to form part of this belligerent expedition, hurry past inestimable wonders, bent solely on destruction... JACK ...you forget yourself, sir."
stephen,"No Jack, You have forgotten your self. You once believed in the rights of each individual man no matter how useless or lowly. But it seems to me now that the long exercise of power has brought you to the point where even a solemn promise..."
jack,The promise was conditional.
stephen,...a promise to a friend of ten years standing who has stood by you and supported you....
stephen,...across half the worlds oceans often at risk to his own life
jack,"...and we have no time for your damned hobbies, sir!"
blakeney,"Sir, I found a curious beetle walking on the deck."
stephen,I'm sure of it.
blakeney,"Were you to have walked all day on the island, you might never have come across it."
stephen,"That is more than likely, sure."
blakeney,You can have it.
stephen,"Thank you, Mr. Blakeney."
killick,No music? That's a shame
jack,"Yes, Killick. Just the one."
allen,Martha's vineyard.
hogg,"No, this here's from Boston. I was married there once."
allen,"Any road, it's a Yankee barrel."
hogg,What they call a Bedford Hog in New England.
hogg,And it's not been in the water more than a week.
allen,One can't say with any accuracy but...
hogg,"Yes you can. There's no sea chummer on it, and the dowels is sound."
jack,"Continue due west, Mr. Bonden."
plaice,"Have you seen the bird, doctor?"
stephen,I have not - no bird these many days. What kind of a bird?
plaice,"A sort of albatross I believe, or perhaps a prodigious great mew. He has been following the ship since... there he is, crossing our wake!"
howard,"My God, man! I'm so sorry. The bird dropped low. I didn't see you there!"
jack,"Calamy! Get Higgins!  Padeen, Davies, carry the Doctor below."
stephen,"It's all right, I am quite capable of walking."
stephen,"You will just make it worse... by prodding, Mr. Higgins, it cannot be got at... except by opening me up."
jack,Are you equal to the task?
higgins,"I'll need to read up on the Doctor's books, like. Study some pictures he has, get my bearings. Be better on land, but I'll manage somehow."
jack,You men get about your business.
pullings,It might be the Acheron. If we put on more sail we'd come up with her before nightfall.
mowett, Davies! Slade!
stephen,Tell me this wasn't on my account?
jack, Can't have him poking around in your belly without a solid platform to work on.
jack,"All set, Higgins?"
stephen,Not Higgins. I do this with my own hand.
stephen, [ ] You are sure you have a head and a stomach for this kind of thing?
stephen,"Then hold my belly, pressing firmly when I give the word."
higgins,"Aye, she'll patch up nicely, sir."
stephen,"Easy away, Jack. Handsomely with the retractor. Higgins, look to the Captain, while I swab."
blakeney,"Well sir, Padeen and I have been doing some collecting for you. The beetles each come with a specimen of plant they were found on. Ooops. Catch him, Padeen! There he goes."
stephen,'Pon my word you have the makings of a true naturalist.
blakeney,"Well sir, perhaps I could combine them, and be a kind of Fighting-Naturalist, like yourself?"
blakeney,Should you really be up?
stephen,Yes. Padeen!
jack,"Oh, a week perhaps. There is no great hurry."
stephen,"But surely, we must make haste for the Marquesas?"
jack,"It may not have been the Acheron that we sighted. Nor can we be sure of her destination.  No, I think we shall go home now, before peace breaks out with France, God forbid."
stephen,"But how will it sit with the Admiralty? To have spent six months in a fruitless pursuit and then come home empty-handed? JACK ""Empty-handed""? Not a bit of it. What about these plants and animals which Blakeney has been collecting? The British museum will need an entire new wing for 'em."
stephen,"I fear, Jack, you have burdened me with a debt I can never repay."
jack,Tosh. Name a shrub after me. Something prickly and hard to eradicate.
stephen,A shrub? I shall name a giant tortoise: Testudo Aubreii!
blakeney,"Doctor, would you think it very unscientific of me to ride on the back of one of those tortoises."
stephen,"No, Mr. Blakeney. I would think it an experiment of absolutely vital importance. But afterwards, I do desire to find that flightless cormorant, assuming that is what it is, and that I still have strength enough to catch it."
blakeney,"Sir, you must hurry!"
stephen,A moment! You're a worse tyrant than any ship's captain.
blakeney,"You must carry him, Padeen!"
jack,I forgot to ask you - did you see your bird?
stephen,I did not. My greatest discovery was your phantom.
jack,"Indeed it was, I'm sorry..."
stephen, Not a bit of it. William and I made a unique discovery.
jack,A phasmid?
blakeney,It's an insect disguised as a stick.
jack,"Mr. Hollar, rouse up all the yellow paint we have. I want six men with brushes slung over the side.  Doudle!"
doudle,Yessir.
jack,Get your sail makers working on this. Sixty yards by five yards with an eyelet every seven feet.
doudle,"Aye, Sir."
jack, Mr. Calamy!
calamy,"Aye, Sir."
jack,"Once we're underway, replace some of the sails with the oldest, most patched set we have."
calamy,"They'll be in the afterhold, Sir. I'll need some men to move all the clutter."
jack,Good. Spread it around the foredeck. The more mess the better.
calamy,Haul away!
hogg,"There, Sir. A mainmast toplight."
jack,"You've got good eyes, Hogg."
stephen,I see. A wolf in sheep in sheep's clothing
jack,"A phasmid, doctor. It was you what gave me the idea."
stephen,I'm not sure a phasmid can be a predator.
jack,No? Well this one is.
calamy,Thank you.
blakeney,You'll make lieutenant out of this.
boyle,He already has. 'Acting' 3rd Lieutenant Peter Calamy.
blakeney,"[       ] Then I'll see you at the forecastle, 'Lieutenant'."
calamy,That's not your station.
blakeney,But naturally I'll board with you?
calamy,"I'm sorry, Will. Captain's orders."
rye,She's seen us!
mowett,She's asking us to heave to. Shall I give the order?
jack,"No, make a show of fleeing upwind, but panicky and disorganized, like a whaler might do."
blakeney,"May I speak with you, Sir."
jack,"No saluting, Mr. Blakeney, we're whalers here."
blakeney,"Mr. Calamy says I am not in the boarding party, I wanted to say -"
jack, I know what you want to say and my answer is no. I promised your mother I would return you in one piece and I have already failed her on that score. You will command a gun and then retire to defend the quarterdeck here with Dr. Maturin.
blakeney,But sir -
jack, - as any dealt at Trafalgar or Cape St. Vincent.
calamy,Three cheers for the Captain.
killick,"I took the liberty, Doctor."
stephen,"[    ] Thank you, Killick."
jack,Mr. Mowett? [  ] A poem might be in order.
mowett,"A poem, Sir? [   ]  'Oh were it mine with sacred Maro's art, To wake to sympathy the feeling heart,"
jack,What!
mowett," ...they were only people of the merchant service, of-course, Sir."
jack,"We have her Mr. Mowett. Strike the Portuguese colours and run up the Jack... Mr. Pullings. Canvas off the gun-ports, and run 'em out. Mr. Howard? Marines away aloft."
jack,Helm's a lee!
jack,Run us down her larboard side then cut across her wake!  Hold fire Mr Pullings! Hold till we're broadside on!
jack,Fire as she bears! Every gun to concentrate on her mainmast!
jack,Now Mr Bonden! Hard a'starboard!
jack,Fire at will!
jack,Boarders away!
calamy,Look to our quarter-deck!
jack,Where is your captain? Ou est votre capitaine?
jack,Le Capitaine? Where is he?
calamy,"He's dead, sir."
calamy,"I'll do it. JOE passes him the needle and twine, then they leave him alone."
jack,John Henry ALLEN... Joseph NAGEL... William Horner... Stephen Winston Boyle... and Lieutenant William Blakeney
all,Amen.
jack,Signal... 'Parole prisoners Valparaiso'...
williamson,"You mean Lieutenant Pullings, Sir?"
jack,No. Captain Pullings.
rye,"....then 'Rendezvous Portsmouth. God- speed, Captain Pullings.'"
stephen,Shall we begin?
stephen,Maybe you did.
jack,What?
stephen,"While I was tending the prisoners they told me their doctor died of fever, two weeks ago. There was no doctor on that ship when we boarded it. And I doubt you will find one there now."
killick,That's the last of the cheese and like as not they'll leave it seizing to their plates with their tweedly tweedly tweedly.
