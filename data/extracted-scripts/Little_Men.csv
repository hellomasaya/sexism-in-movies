Speaker,Dialogue
jake,"It's the sky, Mr. Plummer."
jake, It's Camp Jupiter's sky.
pilar,"Jake! Jake! Hey, Jake! Here!"
pilar,Hey hey hey. Look at you.
jake,What happened?
pilar,Your parents are going to be coming home very late tonight. Come on. Let's go.
jake,I'm thirsty.
pilar,We can stop by Papaya King on the way home.
jake,Yes!
pilar,"Listen, Jake. It's your grandfather Max. There have been some... developments."
jake,Some what?
pilar,"I mean, he got sick, and had to go to the hospital."
jake,Sick with what?
pilar,I'm sure your parents will talk to you when they get home. But I'm going to make dinner for you. What do you want?
jake,I don't know.  What happened to Grandpa Max?
pilar,"When you're old, things happen, Jake. C'mon, let's make the light. We need to get to the grocery."
pilar,Hey! Did you finish your homework?
jake,"Jardine residence, good evening."
jake,Who is this?
jake,Yes.
jake,Umm...
jake,"No, they're not home yet."
jake,Twelve.
jake,What service?
jake,Hold on a second.
pilar,Who is it?
jake,I don't know.
leonor,Antonio! Antonio!
leonor,Come! Come here!*
leonor,Antonio!!
leonor,"What were you doing?? If I say `come here', you have to come. Give them a hand. Go."
brian,"Hello Mrs. Calvelli. Brian Jardine, we've met."
leonor,"Of course, Brian. I'm so sad for what has happened. I'm so sorry."
leonor,I'm sorry. Your father was a such a wonderful man.
brian,Thank you.
leonor,"He really was, you know."
brian,I know.
leonor,This is my son Antonio.
brian,I don't think you've met my wife Kathy.
leonor,Hi. Nice to meet you. Leonor.
kathy,"So nice to meet you too. Sorry, my hands are full."
brian,We're having a little reception upstairs. Just family and a few friends.
leonor,Of course.
tony,Ella the Harpy!
jake,Can you hand that to me?
tony,"She's a nerd, but I have a thing for redheads... Don't you?"
jake,"Here, pass me that. I can carry it."
tony,Tyson is such a douchebag.
jake,"Not in the end, he's not. I just finished The Blood of Olympus."
tony,"I have the game, wanna play?"
jake,"Now? I'd like to, but... I can't. It's my grandfather's--"
tony,I know. I never know what to say in these situations.
jake,"I think you're supposed to say, ""I'm sorry for your loss."""
tony,That's right! I'm sorry for your loss.
jake,"Oh, that's okay."
tony,Wait a minute: what's this one here?
jake,It's the sky.
tony,Did you make this??
jake,"Yeah, it's the sky above Camp Jupiter, the day of the battle."
tony,You're a real artist!
jake,Not really.
tony,Of course you are. This is awesome! You know you'll really like this neighborhood.
jake,We don't live here. It's just a reception.
tony,It's become a very bohemian area. You know what bohemian means?
jake,Yeah...
tony,Very artistic.
brian,"You okay with that, Antonio?"
tony,You can call me Tony.
brian,"Well thank you, Tony. I appreciate the help."
brian,Let me see. That was our first year in the house. Look; I still had braces.
audrey,Dad looks so young here.
brian,He was a handsome guy.
audrey,Listen to you.
brian,What?
audrey,"You look just like him, and you know it. Can I have this? Please?"
brian,Yes. I'll let you have the photo IF...
brian,...you let me have the first edition of The Velveteen Rabbit.
audrey,"Now, wait a minute."
brian,Do you remember Grandpa's friend Stu Gershman?
jake,I don't know.
stu gershman,"Look at you, all grown up now. How's school?"
jake,Okay.
stu gershman,"So, what kind of sports do you like to play?"
brian,He likes to draw and paint.
stu gershman,So you'd like to be an illustrator when you grow up?
jake,I don't know.
stu gershman,"Well, come here. Come here."
stu gershman,"I want to tell you a few things about your grandfather, Jake: he liked to play ball but was a horrible pitcher; he hated summer but went nuts seeing the ladies walk by in mini-skirts; and he was the most loyal friend you could have. Loyalty was his greatest quality."
brian,"Aww... Thanks, Stu. Did you hear that, Jake?"
leonor,It's a dessert we make for special occasions in my country.
leonor,I hope you like it.
kathy,Oh my God. You didn't have to.
leonor,"Max loved this cake, so I thought...."
kathy,Come in. You should come in.
leonor,It's okay.
kathy,Please. I insist.
leonor,"No, I just wanted to bring the cake."
kathy,Sorry if we didn't say anything earlier. Brian and I... we're both very tired. It's all been so fast.
leonor,It's okay. I still have some paperwork to do at the store.
kathy,Thank you so much for this. It's very kind of you. Thank you.
brian,"I swear B, I'm surprised at you. I sit there waiting for you to wake up, but everything's great with you."
suzanne,"No, everything ain't great with me."
brian,No?
suzanne,No. But I got other worries.
brian,Why? What other worries you got?
suzanne,"When am I gonna be a wife again, Eddie?"
brian,I ain't been feeling good. They bother me since they came.
suzanne,"It's almost three months you don't feel good. It's three months, Eddie."
brian,"I don't know, B. I don't want to talk about it."
suzanne,Nice! Okay.
brian,"You go ""you don't like me, heh?"""
suzanne," Yeah, I need a break."
deborah,"Take a break, Suzanne."
suzanne,I'm starving. I've been here since ten.
brian,Of course.
suzanne,How's Kathy?
brian,She's good.
suzanne,And your son?
brian,Jake. He's great. He's in seventh grade already.
suzanne,"Oh my God, I remember him running around backstage at The Lortel, when we did..."
brian,Dark Rapture?
suzanne,Yes! How old was he?
brian,"Two. Three, maybe."
suzanne,Time flies by.
brian,It really does.
suzanne,"Well, it was great to see you."
brian,"Great to see you also, Suzanne. Maybe we'll see each other again soon."
suzanne,I hope so.  Jamie? Do you have lunch for me?
brian,She fucking hates me.
roger,She doesn't hate you.
brian,"Ever since B.U. She dropped out - I stayed and graduated. Every time we've seen each other since then, she always tries to prove that she's better than me."
roger,You're paranoid. You did okay there.
brian,Did I?
roger,Yes. But it's true that she'll have a say in who's cast as her husband.
brian,"I'm telling you. She doesn't like me. I'm in a slump, Roger. You need to help me here."
roger,"Listen, maybe Broadway is not the right way to go for you right now."
brian,I thought that was the strategy.
roger,Why don't we go have some coffee? You have options. There are a bunch of things that could pan out. Let me just finish this.
pilar,I don't remember this.
kathy,Oh my God. We took it home.
kathy,Leonor.
leonor,"Hi Kathy. The boys are in my office, in the back."
kathy,"No, no. Look what I just found."
leonor,It's my plate.
kathy,"I think that night we just ended up taking everything back to our apartment. And then we put things away, and I forgot. I'm so sorry."
leonor,No worries! Please.
kathy,It's a beautiful plate.
leonor,Are you not working today?
kathy,"I don't see patients on Monday. I need a day a week to organize my life, you know."
leonor,Good for you.
kathy,The store looks cute.
leonor,Huh... we're not doing so well.
kathy,I like that dress over there. The one with the floral patterns.
leonor,I love that one. You should try it on.
kathy,I have to go back-
leonor,"Oh, c'mon. It'll take a minute."
leonor,Perfection.
kathy,Are you sure? I don't know.
leonor,"It looks great. All you need is a little fixing up here, maybe a tiny bit tighter here on the waist. But the dress is beautiful."
kathy,How much is it?
leonor,"Whatever the price, I'll give you ten percent discount. Let me see."
kathy,Did you make this?
leonor,"No. Not this one. But everything here is handmade by the designers. This one is two hundred and fifty. It's made by a woman named Talita - she's from Colombia, and very talented. They probably do it in their kitchens, you know what I mean? They're not famous. Yet."
kathy,"Guys, what do you think?"
kathy,"Jake? Jake, what is our deal?"
kathy,They're like zombies when they start playing these games.
jake, Mom. I'm on vacation!
kathy,So?
jake,Dad said it was okay.
kathy,We have this rule in the house; no games during the week. And no internet before five either.
leonor,"But during vacation they have all this free time, and what are you going to do?"
tony,Shhh! Quiet!!
leonor,"Antonio! Watch your tone of voice, por favor! "
tony," Mrs. Jardine. Maybe you will let us finish this level, please?"
leonor,That's better.
kathy,"Sure, you can finish. But first you have to tell me: what do you think? The dress?"
tony,Great. I actually thought it was yours.
kathy,Jake?
jake,Love it. Love the flowers.
brian,Why don't you come help me prepare dinner?
jake,Where's Mom?
brian,Your mother had an emergency with a patient. She's going to be late tonight.
jake,Another suicide?
brian,Jake!
jake,"Dad, I can't find my drawings."
brian,What drawings? Help me cut these.
jake,The series I made on Percy Jackson. The sea of monsters?
brian,Those old drawings?
jake,Yes.
brian,Did you look in the trunk?
jake,"Yes, Dad. I looked. They're not there."
brian,"I don't know, Jake. Maybe they got thrown away."
jake,Why would you do that? They're my drawings!
brian,Why don't you just make new ones.
jake,New ones are never like the old ones!
brian,"Jake. We moved. We got rid of furniture. We threw away clothes, and we gave books away. We have a new apartment."
jake,So?
brian,"Listen. Let me tell you something. It's good to get rid of stuff. It's hard at first, but then it feels really good. You have to learn to let go."
brian,"I play Trigorin. He's a celebrated writer, and the boyfriend of a famous actress, Arkadina."
jake,Why the weird names?
brian,"Can I finish? Her son Konstantin is an aspiring writer who lives with his uncle Sorin in this dacha, where they all come together one summer to see his new play."
jake,Finished?
brian,"That's just the beginning, actually."
jake,What's a dacha?
brian,"A dacha is like a big country estate in Russia. That's where the whole thing takes place, and that's why the funny names. There's also Nina. She's the neighbors's daughter, who wants to be an actress. At first she seems to be in love with Konstantin but ends up having an affair with my character, Trigorin."
jake,Sounds complicated.
brian,"Well, it is complex. And unexpected. But it has a lot of humor in it too."
jake,What part?
kathy,Good. You guys are already eating.
jake,Hi Mom.
brian,How was it?
kathy,Fine. She's doing okay. The problem now is her husband.
kathy,But the last thing I want to do right now is talk about work. I'm starving.
brian,I was just telling Jake about the play.
jake,I thought you weren't working with the Terrain anymore. I thought you were going to do Broadway now.
brian,It's not that simple.
jake,"You said you weren't doing this non- profit stuff anymore. That the strategy was to reach ""a wider audience""."
brian,"Well, things have changed."
kathy,"Jake, you should applaud your father for being adaptable. That's what life is all about."
umar,Tony! Hey! Come play! We need one more here!
joey,"Oops! Watch out, Katy Perry!"
tony, Eight minutes and twenty three seconds!
leonor,Hey! Hey! Hey!
tony, A new record! Around the block and up the stairs in eight minutes and twenty three seconds!
leonor,"Wow, I think you should call the Guinness Book."
tony,That's a great idea! I'll write them an email.
jake,"Good evening, Mrs. Calvelli."
leonor,"Hi Jake.  You haven't said hello, Mister!"
tony,Hello Hernn. This is my friend Jacob Jardine. But we call him Jake.
hernn,"Hello there, Jake."
tony,"He used to live in Manhattan, but now he lives above Mami's store. Jake, this is Hernn."
hernn,Ah! So you are the Grandson-
leonor," Yes. Max was his grandfather. His father is Brian Jardine, the one that I told you about."
jake,My father's an actor. And my mom is a psychotherapist.
hernn,I see. So how do you like Brooklyn so far?
jake,"I like it a lot. It's more peaceful than Manhattan, and we have much more space. It's great."
hernn,"So Jake, are you going to be an actor, like your father?"
jake,I don't know.
hernn,But you look like an artist yourself. With that long hair and everything.
jake,Maybe.
leonor,"He'll tell us more later, right Jake? Go ahead."
tony,Is your father any good at acting?
jake,I don't know. Maybe.
tony,"I thought if he was, I might have a conversation with him, cause I'm going to be an actor when I grow up. Maybe he can give me some pointers."
jake,"Sure, yeah. I guess. He's not that successful or anything."
tony,"My dream is to go to the LaGuardia High School for the Performing Arts? You know that school? Nicki Minaj went there. And Al Pacino, but heflunked out."
jake,I think my dad applied there.
tony,"Really? It's my dream school. I'm looking around at some theater classes, and practicing on my own, so I can audition next year for ninth grade."
jake,But I'm not an actor.
tony,"That's okay. You can read, can't you? Here look at this. This is a scene from Pariah, or the Outcast, by August Strindberg. It's perfect for us to work on, cause it's just two guys."
tony,"And you know what, if you practice your drawing more, and get better, maybe we could both go to LaGuardia. It's for all kinds of artists. It's very Bohemian."
jake,I guess I can try.
tony,That's the spirit.
jake,Is Hernn your mom's boyfriend?
tony,"Hernn? Eww, gross. No. He's just a friend of her's from Chile. My mom is still married to my dad. They just don't live together much."
jake,I don't understand.
tony,"Me either! My dad travels a lot, so they are never together. He's a nurse, and he works for Doctors Without Borders, which is from what I can tell a job you get if you want free plane flights."
jake,Where is he now?
tony,"He's in Angola. That's in Africa. Until he was 20 he never left this neighborhood, and then once he left he barely ever came back. If I wasn't here I don't think he'd ever come back to Brooklyn."
tony,Look what he sent me.
jake,Do you miss having him around more?
tony,"At first I did. But it's been a few years now, so I got used to it."
jake,"Sometimes my dad goes away, if he's shooting a movie. But it hasn't really happened in a while."
tony,Maybe he's not the guy I should talk to.
jake,I don't know. He's been in a bunch of plays and stuff.
tony,Found it!
tony,"My dad and I are going to go on a safari, and these are just like some of the animals we are going to see."
jake,Do you wish they still lived together?
tony,"Sometimes. When my dad comes to visit, he'll cook Porcheta. It's like roast pork butt."
jake,Ewww.
tony," We sit at the table just the three of us, and he tells stories about his work and the places he's been, and stories about the different people he's met in Africa. Then it seems like normal. But then, pretty soon they start fighting about something stupid. And I realize it's better when he's not around."
jake,"Imagine if your mom goes with you on your safari, and they end up falling in love again."
tony,I think there's very little chance of that happening.
jake,"But just imagine: you get an envelope one day. You open it and it's two tickets to a safari. One for you, and one for your mom. And she decides to go, because she feels like she needs a vacation. So when you get to Africa, your dad picks you both up at the airport, and takes you to this incredible place. Like this photo here. You see lions and elephants, giraffes. And then, it's the end of a beautiful day in the African savannah. Your dad wants to take you up this big hill to see the sunset, but you're too tired, so you tell your parents you're going to rest in your hotel room."
tony,"So they go the two of them alone. And when they get there, the colors of the sky are like nothing they've ever seen before..."
jake,A green sky with yellow stars...
leonor,Who wants pasta primavera?
jake,Yes!
tony,"Mami, can I stay for dinner with the Jardine's?"
leonor,Tony...
tony,Please Mami. They're having hamburgers.
jake,And hot dogs.
leonor,"We have dinner at home. Besides, I can't come and pick you up later. And I don't like you walking home alone at night."
jake,He can sleep over.
leonor, Have you talked to your father about this?
jake,He won't mind.
leonor,Are you sure?
tony,"Please, Mami."
jake,Dad!
brian,"Yes, Jake?"
jake,Can Tony sleep over tonight?
brian,"Well, hello Leonor."
leonor,"Sorry to interrupt, Brian."
brian,"No, please, you're not... You've met my sister Audrey, haven't you?"
leonor,"Yes, of course."
audrey,Hi Leonor. Long time no see.
leonor,Jake is asking if Tony can stay for dinner-
jake,And a sleep-over!
leonor,"Yes, because after dinner it would be too late for him to walk home alone."
brian,"Tony, do you want to have hamburgers and hot dogs with us tonight?"
tony,Yes!
brian,"Done deal, bro."
leonor, I just wanted to make sure with you...
brian,Please. I can't tell you how happy I am that Jake has a new friend. He spends too much time alone. And it's not easy for him with other boys. So it's great that he and Tony get along so well.
brian,"You've got a great kid, but I guess you know that."
leonor,Thank you.
audrey,"Leonor, do you want some wine?"
audrey,"Brian and I wanted to have a talk with you anyway, about some things, so maybe this is a good time."
leonor,"No, thank you. I have to go back and finish some stuff at the office."
audrey,"We'd love a minute with you if that's ok. Right, Brian?"
audrey,"Liam, watch out! Your cousin is smaller than you!"
leonor,I have to go. But thank you.
brian,"You know, Leonor, after my father died, there was so much to do. We decided to move in, and time just flew by. You and I haven't really had a chance to talk about the store, and all that stuff. Maybe we can have a chat this week?"
leonor,This week is not good for me. I'm doing inventory.
brian,Next week?
leonor,Could be.
brian,"Thursday I finish rehearsal early, so I could come by early afternoon."
leonor,Sure.
brian,Great.
audrey,"Truth is, the neighborhood is changing and that's a very old- fashioned store."
brian,C'mon guys! The burgers are getting cold.
kathy,She complained to me that business wasn't so good.
brian,Of course she's going to say that. Contract is up.
audrey,My guy told me that a similar space in the area is going for five thousand.
kathy,What??
jake,"Can I have mine with cheese, mustard and ketchup, please?"
kathy,That's crazy.
brian,"Guests first. What do you want on yours, Tony?"
tony,"Cheese, onions, avocado. And ketchup, please."
audrey,That's in the low numbers.
tony,And mayonnaise.
kathy,Scary.
brian,"Jake, have some salad also."
jake,I'll have some afterwards.
brian,"Tony, salad?"
tony,"No thank you, Mr. J. Is that alright if I call you that?"
kathy,And what is the number now?
brian,"Sure, Tony. That's fine."
audrey,"One something. For eight years, never an increase."
brian,Maybe we should talk about this later?
kathy,"So Tony, I hear your dad lives in Africa."
tony,"In Angola. It's an old Portuguese colony in Africa. I wrote a paper on it last year at school, and got an B plus, which was pretty good, cause I only spent about an hour on it. Sometimes at my school the teachers are whack cause they give you good grades for the things you don't try hard on, and bad grades for the things you do."
tony,"Can you pass the ketchup, Mr. J? I've always liked a lot of ketchup."
linda,"Hi, can I help you guys?"
tony,We're here for the acting class.
linda,We have quite a few. Do you mean the Breakthrough Class?
tony,Yes. That one.
linda,"Well, it's twenty dollars for the first class. But you can buy a package of twenty classes for three hundred."
tony," Got cash, buddy?"
tony,"Oops, sorry. Hmm. What's your name?"
linda,My name is Linda. What's yours?
tony,Tony. And this is my friend Jake.
linda,Hi guys.
tony,What is your sign?
linda,My sign?
tony,Of the zodiac. But no. Let me guess.
linda,Go ahead.
tony,You're a Leo.
linda,How did you know??
tony,Leos are very confident. You seem very sure of yourself.
linda,Wow. I'm impressed.
tony,"Linda, I'm going to be honest with you. My friend and I heard this place was the best acting school in the area, and we would love to check it out. To see if we want to make the investment. Can you make us a discount?"
linda,"Like I told you. If you buy a package of twenty, you get a discount."
tony,They also say Leos are very generous.
linda,Comes down to fifteen bucks a class.
tony,Well maybe you can help with something else.
linda,Sure.
tony,Maybe you can give me some directions?
linda,Where to?
tony,To your heart.
linda,You're too much. Go in. But only this time. And don't tell anyone.
tony,"Thank you, Linda. You won't regret it!"
linda, Down the hall to the last door on the right.
acting teacher,"The first thing is to really look at somebody, and just talk and listen, listen and talk. "
acting teacher,Does that make sense?
acting teacher,"Okay, let's begin."
julia,You're wearing a pretty shirt.
sally,I'm wearing a pretty shirt.
julia,You're wearing a pretty shirt.
sally,Do you like my shirt?
acting teacher,NO! No questions. Observations. Let's start again.
sally,You have a little nose.
acting teacher,Quiet! Concentrate.
sally,You have a little nose.
julia,I have a little nose.
sally,You have a little nose.
julia,"Alright, I have a little nose."
sally,You have a little nose.
julia,I have a little nose.
sally,You seem a little bothered.
julia,I seem a little bothered.
sally,Yes. You seem a little bothered.
julia,You're getting a kick out of that.
sally,I'm getting a kick out of that.
julia,Well don't get offended.
sally,I'm not getting offended.
julia,You are acting like a baby.
sally,I'm acting like a baby.
acting teacher,Ok. Ok. Stop. That was okay. It could be better. Yes? Back to your seats.
acting teacher,You. Look at me. Don't move.
acting teacher,Stand up.
acting teacher,"We've got to keep the contact. We've got to keep the repetition. The contact comes from my behavior. Not just what I say, but what I do."
acting teacher,Look at me. Now tell me something you observed on your way here today.
jake,I almost fell.
acting teacher,You almost fell.
jake,I almost fell crossing the Parkway.
acting teacher, You see he didn't do it. What was I saying?
jake,I'm sorry I don't understand.
acting teacher,You don't need to understand. Acting is not understanding. It's feeling. It's reacting. Does that make sense? Look at me. Listen to me.
acting teacher,What did I say without words? What did my behavior say? Now say it again.
jake,"I'm sorry, say what again?"
acting teacher,That you fell.
jake,You want me to say again that I fell?
acting teacher,Yes.
jake,With words?
acting teacher,"Yes, with words!"
jake,I almost fell on my way to class today.
acting teacher,You fell on your way to class today.
jake,I almost fell on my way to class today.
acting teacher,You fell on your way to class today.
jake,You're not listening to me.
acting teacher,I'm not listening to you.
jake,You're not listening to me.
acting teacher,I'm not listening.
jake,You're not listening.
acting teacher,I'm not listening.
jake, You're not listening.
acting teacher,Good! That's it. Good. Do you all see the difference? Yes?
tony,"Hey, I know you from St. Grace, right?"
julia,"Yeah, I used to go there. I go to Humanities Prep now, in Manhattan."
tony,"Oh, la di da."
eva,"We all went to St. Grace. There were some crazy people in that school. Julia, you remember Mr. Clay?"
julia,How could I forget Mr. Clay? That hair!
julia,Three hairs came from the bottom in the back and somehow they ended spreading like a wig in front. Does he still do it?
tony,"Yeah. Only difference is now that he's older, he does it with two hairs, instead of three."
eva,I never even noticed his hair.
julia,How could you not?
eva,Mr. Clay was the first love of my life. I was completely obsessed with him.
all,Eeeewwww!!!
eva,I used to fantasize about kissing him all the time.
julia,Gross!
eva,Did you ever see his body? Hello?? He used to play volleyball with us. In the summer he'd take his shirt off. He was as hairy as an ape. I loved it.
julia,"So Jake, you were pretty good in class today. That was a tough exercise."
jake,I don't know.
tony,Jake's going to be an artist when he grows up.
sally,Are you? What's your medium?
jake,"I paint, but you need to have something special to be a painter, and I'm not so sure I've got it."
tony,"You just need to believe in yourself a little bit. That's all.  My friend has a little problem with his confidence. But we're working on that. Right, Jake?"
tony,"Hey, who wants to do the repeat game with me? I need to practice."
sally, Who wants to do the repeat game with me?
tony, No questions!!
eva,No questions!!
tony,Look at me! Listen to me! Acting is not understanding! You don't need to understand. Does that make sense? Yes? Yes? Yes?
tony,"Hey Umar, you should try that thing that the Brazilian does, Felipe Melo. You look to one player but you pass the ball to the other side."
umar,We could try it if you played with us more often.
tony,I don't know what you're talking about.
umar,You didn't show up last Saturday.
joey,It's because Tony has a new boyfriend now!
tony,"Yeah, ask your sister if she thinks I'm the type to have a boyfriend. She knows."
tony,So what?
joey,"That's his school, isn't it?"
tony,What are you talking about?
umar,Roller girl.
joey,Little Jake. My cousin goes to his school. They say he's a weirdo.
tony,"Shut up, Joey!"
joey,My cousin says he draws dresses for the girls during recess.
joey,Hey! Give that back to me!
tony,There you are. Eat it.
tony,Give that back!
bianca,Can I help you?
jake,No thank you.
jake,Hi Leonor.
leonor,"Wait, wait. Where do you think you're going?"
jake,Is Tony in the office?
leonor,"He is, and he's staying there. He's helping me out today."
jake,But we're supposed to meet some friends.
leonor,Are those the same friends that beat him up?
jake,What??
leonor,That's right. They beat him up. You should ask him why.
tony,Hey.
jake, What happened??
tony,Nothing. I bumped into Joey at soccer.
jake,But your mom--
tony,"She's so dramatic, she deserves an Academy Award. She doesn't want me to go out so I can help her with this. Look."
tony,"She's terrible with numbers, you know. You go ahead. I'll come find you as soon as I finish here."
nina,What are you writing?
arkadina,Boris! Where are you?
arkadina,"We are not going away, after all."
nina,It is a dream!
director,"Okay. Let's try this one more time. And Brian, when you mention the dead seagull, don't look away from Nina."
brian,"More seductive, you mean."
director,"Exactly. You're very myopic. You have an obsession with the details of things, of people. And in this scene you're fully focused on Nina. You're like a razor beam."
leonor,Brian. I was waiting.
brian,I'm so sorry. Rehearsal went later than I expected. Is this still a good time?
leonor,Yes. I sent the girl home early so we could talk. You want to go inside? I'm just going to finish this.
brian,The store looks nice.
leonor,Thanks. I did a lot of work here.
brian,"The reason why I'm here, Leonor..."
leonor,I know.
brian,Your lease has been expired for more than six months now. I guess you guys were about to renew it when my father passed?
leonor,"Brian, why don't you sit down."
brian,"My sister and I are working on the transfer of ownership for the house. It's almost done; Dad left everything in order, all the taxes paid and all that. The only thing still pending is the store, which needs to have a new lease."
leonor,"You know, your father never thought much about contracts. He was very happy to have me here. Max thought my store gave ""glamour"" to the neighborhood, and he was proud to be associated."
brian,"The situation has changed, and now we have two families owning the house; mine and Audrey's. It's better for us, and for you, to have things done the right way, wouldn't you agree?"
leonor,It depends on what the right way is for you.
brian,"Leonor, this neighborhood is changing very fast. The rents have gone up quite a lot in the past few years. I'm sure you've noticed."
leonor,"Yes, I noticed and so did Max. But it was his desire that I stay here."
brian,"We don't want you to go away. My sister Audrey has prepared a new lease for you, and we think it's very fair. We aren't trying to get market rate here, we know that's not possible, but still, you can't expect to pay the same rent you paid when you first moved in."
brian,"Here, why don't you take a look."
leonor,"Before we go any further with this conversation, I want you to take a look at this."
leonor,"I am probably the last person to have photos printed, the old fashioned way. It's completely different than seeing them on a cellphone, don't you agree?"
leonor,"That's me in the backyard, on July 4th. That's me and Tony and your father at the Fair of St. Anthony's. That's us with my family, when they were visiting. Your father and I were very good friends. We spent a lot of time together. What you and your sister don't understand is that Max wanted me to stay here. He thought of me as part of this house, this neighborhood."
leonor,"I was more his family, if you want to know, than you were."
brian,That's a ridiculous thing to say.
leonor,You hardly talked to each other. You never came to visit. I was the one here. I saw him everyday.
brian,"This is not what I came here for. Why don't we go back to the lease. Take a look, please. It's fair."
leonor,"No, I don't need to. I have an idea what you and your sister have in mind. I'll just give this to my lawyer because, to be honest with you, Brian, I'm not sure I owe you anything. Maybe it's the other way around."
brian,"Well, I guess there's not that much more to be said then."
leonor,No.
brian,"Goodnight, Leonor."
kathy,Brian. Want to help me out here?
brian,"Sure, but just give me a moment."
kathy,What's wrong?
jake,Hi Dad!
tony,"Hi, Mr. J."
brian," Jake, you know it's a weekday. What are you doing playing video games?!"
jake,Can Tony stay and eat with us?
brian, No.
jake,Why not? He wanted to ask you about your acting career.
brian,That's enough for tonight. Turn it off.
jake,"Dad, c'mon!"
brian,I said no.
tony,We're about to finish the level.
brian,"Tony, you need to go home now. We can talk about acting another time."
tony,"Sure, Mr. J."
brian," I'm sorry, buddy. Your mother is waiting for you downstairs."
kathy,Did you ask your mother?
tony,She loves when Jake comes over.
jake,"Please, Mom? Please?"
kathy,Jake I just made dinner.
jake,"I'll eat it tomorrow for lunch, I promise."
kathy,Okay. But I want you back here in the morning.
jake,Yes! Thanks.
tony,"Thank you, Mrs. Jardine."
leonor,"No, Antonio."
tony,"C'mon, Mami. We have spaghetti in the fridge."
leonor,When I say no I mean it. Don't ask me again.
tony,"But we're going to be super quiet! Aren't we, Jake?"
jake,Yes we are.
leonor,Antonio. No. Listen to me and don't argue.
jake,It's okay Tony. I'll see you tomorrow.
leonor,"Goodnight, Jake."
jake,"Goodnight, Mrs. Calvelli."
tony,See you tomorrow.
jake,"Yeah, see you tomorrow."
tony,I'm not talking to my mother anymore.
jake,Why not?
tony,She said you can't come over to our place. It's not right.
jake,Why doesn't she want me over?
tony,"I don't think your father wants me around very much anymore either. He might be too chicken to come out and say it, but I can tell."
jake,Why are they so mad at us?
tony,Our parents are involved in a business matter and it's getting ugly. So they're taking it out on us.
jake,You're right. My dad was very cold to you.
tony,You'd think I was the enemy.
jake,I won't talk to my parents either then.
tony,Really?
jake,Really. Not unless they apologize.
umar,Tony! C'mon!! Are you playing or what?
tony,You sure you can handle it? It won't be easy.
jake,Of course I can handle it.
tony,"You're a great friend, Jake."
jake,You too.
brian,Hey.
brian,Did something happen with Leonor downstairs?
brian,The store is closed. It's not even five yet.
brian,Have you seen Tony?
brian,"Jake, can you stop playing around for a second??"
brian,Did you see if the store was open earlier when you got home?
brian,Was it open?
brian,No? It wasn't?
brian,Talk to me Jake!
brian, Audrey. Hi.
kathy,It's not your fault.
brian,But I feel very responsible. We are responsible.
kathy,Audrey will tell you if she thinks you owe her money. Don't worry about it.
brian,She sort of did already.
kathy,What?
brian,She told me we owe her money for the store.
kathy,Incredible.
brian,"Yes, I know."
kathy,Jake. Did you see Leonor today?
kathy,Ah. Still not talking.
brian,No.
kathy,"You know, you can't go on with this forever."
kathy, Have you seen Jake's latest artwork?
brian,No.
kathy,He's been doing a lot of mythological stuff.
brian,Is that inspired by that book I gave you?
brian,The Blood of Olympus.
kathy,"Truth is, if he's really serious about applying to LaGuardia, he's going to need to start preparing a serious portfolio, no?"
brian,"Yes. From what I remember, only 2% of the students who apply to LaGuardia get accepted. This means two out of a hundred. Twenty out of a thousand. They're not just looking for talent; they're looking for serious commitment."
kathy,And you famously flunked.
brian,"I didn't ""flunk""!"
brian,"I wasn't accepted, which is different."
kathy,Hello.
bianca,Hi. Can I help you with anything?
kathy,"Thanks. I'm looking for Leonor. Oh, I see her."
kathy,Hi Leonor.
leonor,"Hi. Just a second, let me just me finish this."
leonor,You're home early.
kathy,Monday.
leonor,"Right. Your day off. Oh, you have to see this new dress. Bianca, show her the new dress! The green one."
bianca,"Remember the original wrap dress, the first one that Diane von Furstenberg made?"
kathy,"Of course. Wow, that's an original?"
bianca,"No, we found this fabric, it's vintage fabric. And Leonor made the dress herself."
kathy,It's beautiful. Wow. But it's really not my style. Thank you. I need to talk to Leonor.
kathy,Cute dress.
leonor,I made it. The fabric is vintage.
kathy,"Yes. I really like it, but I can't wear anything too tight on the waist these days. I need to lose a few pounds first."
kathy,"Leonor, do you have a minute?"
leonor,I have to finish this for a client tonight.
kathy,Tony is still not talking?
leonor,No. Not a word to me yesterday.
kathy,Same with Jake.
leonor,It's very annoying.
kathy,"The one good thing, I have to say, is that Jake has been drawing and painting more than ever."
leonor,Is that good?
kathy,"Yes! If he really wants to apply to LaGuardia, he needs to prepare a portfolio. Is Tony still planning on applying also?"
leonor,How would I know? It's been four days and he hasn't said a word to me.
kathy,"Listen, Leonor, you know that I'm trained in conflict resolution, so I'm hoping I can help here, help settle this problem between you and our family."
leonor,Oh really? Has your husband asked you to do that?
kathy,"No. And by the way, he's been working really hard. I'm not sure you know that, but he's rehearsing for a new play."
leonor,No. I haven't seen your husband.
kathy,I know he's been waiting to hear from you.
kathy,Leonor?
kathy,Can't we talk about what is really going on here?
leonor,Shh. Not here.
kathy,"I know you think we're the rich people coming into this neighborhood, but the truth is Brian hasn't made any money in years. I've been supporting this family with my hard work."
leonor,That's not my problem.
kathy,I know it's not. I'm just trying to talk about it.
leonor,"You think talking is going to solve all your problems, don't you? You think you can use some of your psychology class tricks and just wash away the dirt here? That dirt is my sweat, sweetie. It's my life. It's not going to be that easy."
kathy,"I know that. What I want to tell you is we will give you time, but we need this money. We need the shop to cover its rent. That's not an unfair thing to ask of a tenant."
leonor,But I'm not a tenant. To Max I was more than a tenant. I was family. I belong here. And before you go any further; let me ask you: do you know how much work I've done here? The tile floors? The marble bathroom? That office in the back? I paid for all that.
tony,You look like you've been doing this acting thing forever.
julia,Really?
tony,"Like when you did the Emotional Recall exercise, it just seems so natural, I can't explain."
julia,"You know, my father was a stunt man when I was a kid. So I spent a lot of time on sets and stuff."
tony,So you have been doing this forever.
julia,"No, because when I was eight years old he died."
tony,Did he die doing a stunt?
julia,No! He had throat cancer.
tony,Oh.  I'm sorry for your loss.
julia, I'll see you later?
tony,I hope so.
tony,Do you know anyone with a swimming pool?
jake,"No, why?"
tony,I would do anything to see her in a bikini. Can you imagine?
jake,I never thought about that.
tony,So what about you? Who do you like?
jake,They're all very nice.
tony,"You can tell me, you know."
jake,Tell you what?
tony,If you like someone.
jake,I don't know.
tony,That's what you always say.
jake,Well I do have an idea you might like.
tony,What?
jake,"Eva talked about going dancing. There's a matinee club, like after hours, for kids."
tony,When is it?
jake,"Sunday afternoon, in the City."
tony,Let's go!
jake,"It would be fun, right?"
tony,That would be perfect. If I can just dance with her...
tony,"Wow, that's getting good, Jake. I'm impressed."
leonor,Your father.
nick,"Tony! Whoa, man, watch out buddy."
nick,"Wait, wait. Let me do this for you. Don't worry. This is good luck. There you go. So tell me; what's going on? How's school? You still hoping for LaGuardia?"
leonor,"C'mon, Antonio. You're not going to talk to your father?"
nick,Did the cat get your tongue?
leonor,You forget he's too old for this kind of joke.
nick,What happened?
leonor,He's mad at his mother.
nick,What about?
leonor,Ask him.
nick,"Tony, now that I'm here you're not going to say anything to me?"
leonor,"Go finish your homework, Antonio. We're having dinner soon."
nick,"So what are you going to do, Leonor?"
leonor,"I don't know yet, but Hernn is helping me out."
nick,Hernn? Isn't he a bankruptcy lawyer?
leonor,Yes.
nick,Is he the best person for this?
leonor,He's my friend. He knows strategy.
nick,Are we talking about an exit strategy?
leonor,No. A fighting strategy.
nick,But you should have an exit plan.
leonor,I intend to fight. They can't do this to me.
nick,What if they can?
leonor,"What do you want me to say, Nick? That I'm going to open a drug store? Start making furniture?"
nick,Or look for a job?
leonor,You can't be serious.
nick,"Don't take everything so personally, Leonor. The world isn't always stacked up against you."
leonor,What does this have to do with anything?
nick,Rent goes up. That's life in this city. These people are not doing this to you.
leonor,Why do you always have to disagree with me?
nick,I'm not disagreeing with you.
leonor,Can't you be on my side for once in your life?
nick,I'm just being realistic. Life here is expensive. I think you should have a plan.
leonor,What do you think I'm doing? Do you think this is easy for me?
nick,I know it's not.
leonor,"That store is how I have raised our son. With not much help from you, thank you very much."
nick,That's not true.
leonor,Really? Do you think that sending him a little gift at the end of the year is enough to keep him fed? To buy him clothes? To take him to a movie every so often?
nick,"Can we not talk about money now? Damn, Leonor. You spoil everything. I can't even eat."
nick,Can you keep a secret? Swear? I was invited to head the mission in Kinshasa. It's a nice big city for Africa.  Oh no. No! No!! Shit.
nick,"Not far from Angola. I'm finally going to have my own apartment. Why don't you come and stay with me for a while? We could go on a safari. The rainforest is incredible. They're famous for these big gorillas, hippopotamus, all kinds of animals."
nick,This acting school thing. Is it serious?
nick,How serious?
nick,That's good. There's a lot more in this world than Brooklyn.
nick,"Listen, Tony. I know your mom can be a little rough, but she's just worried about you. You're not a kid anymore, and she needs you to look out for her. I need you to look out for her."
audrey,"Well, Dad must have really liked her. That part I think she's probably right about. He never raised the rent on the store. Not even once in more than eight years. And now Leonor's lawyer is charging us for improvements she made in the store."
brian,What does that mean?
audrey,"She wants to fight. The woman is trouble, Brian. Once again, our warm, lovable, unwise father left us with a big mess, and no instructions."
audrey,"Is it terrible, Brian, that I don't really miss him?"
brian,"No, it's not terrible. It's sad, but I don't blame you."
audrey,Do you miss him?
brian,"Sometimes. But I live in his house, so I probably think about him more than you do."
audrey,She's claiming she has the right to stay paying almost nothing. I think we should start the eviction process as soon as possible.
brian,I don't want to have to do that.
audrey,"It takes a while, you know."
brian,I just don't want this to get ugly. The boys are best friends now.
audrey,"Remember that Dad worked very hard to leave us something. Now you have a nice big apartment, and I'm getting nothing."
brian,Just give me a little more time.
audrey,"I can't do this without you, you know."
tony,"Hey, do you want to come with me to the beach?"
tony,The beach! This summer! You want to come with me?
tony,Yes? No?
julia,"No, Tony. You're really nice and everything..., but I'm into older guys."
tony,"Oh, okay. Thank you for being honest."
julia,What?
tony, Thank you for being honest.
brian,Do you want some more?
kathy,Sure.
kathy,How'd it go?
brian,"I think it's going to be great. I love my part, I love the actors, the play is fantastic."
kathy,I'll toast to that.
kathy,What's going on?
brian,Did you see the sign Leonor has posted in the window?
kathy,"No, I didn't see anything."
brian,"She doesn't acknowledge the new lease, she doesn't try to negotiate and she has no plans of leaving. And now she's actually hiring new people, can you believe it?"
kathy,I told you this wasn't going to be easy.
brian,Audrey wants to start an eviction process. She has a lawyer ready to go already.
kathy,Good. Then it's decided.
brian,Is it?
kathy,Who's going to tell Jake?
brian,I will. It's my problem.
kathy,Well then tell him soon. Please.
brian,He's just being so childish lately.
nina,What are you writing?
arkadina,Boris! Where are you?
arkadina,"We are not going away, after all."
nina,It is a dream!
roger,It's in your delivery. It's very natural. You really manage to make Trigorin feel contemporary.
brian,"Well, thank you, Roger."
roger,"He's like one of those famous artists we meet at a party, you know? You're excited at first, but the minute you start a conversation, you're begging not to be left alone with the guy."
brian,Is that a good thing?
roger,Yes!
kathy,He's such a tormented artist. It's wonderful.
roger,And there were some really funny parts too.
brian,Isn't it! Chekhov called it a comedy in four acts.
roger,"Act two, particularly."
brian, It is.
roger,Bye Kathy. Great to see you.
kathy,"Loved seeing you, Roger. It's been a great night."
roger,Bye fellas. You should be very proud of this man here!
brian,So?
kathy,Jake? It's your dad's opening night.
brian,Did you understand why Nina says she's the seagull?
kathy,"Brian. They're kids. To be honest, I'm not even sure I get that part."
kathy,But that doesn't take anything away from the pleasure of the story.
brian,Do either of you care about anyone other than yourselves?
brian,Jake? Say something.
brian,Say something!
brian,One of the hardest things to realize as a child is that your parents are people too. Can you understand that? That they care about things. That they make mistakes. That they try to do what they think is right. Does any of what I'm saying make any sense to you?
brian,"What's so funny, Tony? Why don't you tell me, what's funny?? You think being an actor is easy? You think you have it in you for one rejection after another? Let's see how you react when you don't get into LaGuardia. Let's just see then."
kathy,Brian...
brian,God damn it!!
leonor,"Dresses go over there, on that rack on the left. Before you hang them, make sure they have a price tag. Also, try to arrange them by color, or tone. I usually like to start with lighter colors in the front, and end with darker ones. Black goes in the back. The women here like black a lot, so if they're looking for a little black dress, they might see a lot of other stuff before they get there."
valentina,"I see. So if they don't know what they want, I try to keep them here in the front first, and then show them the ones in the back."
leonor,Unless they ask specifically for black.
valentina,Hello. Can I help you?
leonor,"It's okay, Valentina. It's for me. This is Brian Jardine, our neighbor. He's a great actor."
valentina,Oh really? Have I seen you in anything?
brian,I doubt it.
leonor,He's in a new play. What is it called?
brian,The Seagull.
leonor,Oh. That must be very popular.
brian,Can you give me five minutes alone? Please?
leonor,"The day your father died, he came by in the morning. I asked him to buy me a pack of cigarettes, and then I never saw him again."
leonor,"Your father cared about me, Brian. Do you believe that? Every day we would talk, and we would share things with each other. Have you ever had a friend like that? Someone you could tell anything?"
brian,Only my wife. I'm a lot like Jake. I've never been good at having close friends.
brian,I hope you can understand that what's happening is nothing personal.
leonor,I can't afford to pay three times the rent I paid your father. It's not possible. I can't survive.
leonor,I thought you were in a new big play.
brian,"I am in a new play. But it's not big, and it's not a lot of money. It's just the way it is, Leonor. I'm fortunate enough to have had a father who left me a house in Brooklyn."
leonor,He wanted me to stay here. He told me so.
brian,"Leonor. I also have a sister, and she has her own family, and we all have to decide together what to do. It's not just up to me."
leonor,You know your father thought your sister was the one who inherited his brains.
brian,"They were very much alike. I'm sure he would agree with Audrey that, above everything, it's important to take care of business."
leonor,No. He wouldn't have agreed. I can promise you that.
brian,"Leonor, what do you want me to say? I have a family. We have bills too."
leonor,"Do you know why your father didn't go to your son's birthday party, the last one?"
brian,He had the flu.
leonor,"No. That's maybe what he told you. The truth is, he was embarrassed, Brian. He was embarrassed that everything in your house was paid for by your wife. He thought you should be more of a man. He hated being around you."
brian,"Well, he's not around anymore, is he."
leonor,He certainly isn't.
hernn,This Holdover clause is common in any commercial lease.
leonor,What am I going to do? I can't afford this.
leonor,Jesus! I told you to knock before you come in. What do you want? 
leonor,I am so tired of you playing this silly game!
hernn,"I'm sorry, Leonor."
leonor,Where do they even get this number?
hernn,"The penalty for overstaying may seem like a high number, and it is. That's why it's in the contract; to prevent that the tenant overstays paying below the market rent indefinitely."
leonor,Isn't there anything else we can do?
hernn,"Leonor, I've done everything I can. It's over now. You have a week to leave the premises."
tony,"Don't worry, Mami. I'm going to help you. I promise, I'll figure out a way we can work it all out.  He holds her as her crying turns into sobs."
tony,"Hello, Mr. J. Is Jake home?"
brian,"Yes, he's doing his homework."
tony,I'd like to talk to him if I could.
brian,"Of course, Tony. Come in."
brian,Why don't you both come in. Leonor. Please.
kathy,"You sure I can't get you something, Leonor."
leonor,"Yes, I'm fine."
jake,Mom! Dad! Mom!!
brian,He talks! Jacob talks!
jake,Mom!!!
kathy,What's going on?!
jake,"Mom, Tony told me Leonor is being evacuated from the store!"
kathy,It's not an evacuation. It's an eviction.
jake,That's worse!
jake,How could you do that? How could you do that to them? Dad??
brian,It's a terrible situation.
jake,"The rent is too expensive! She can't afford it, Mom. So Dad needs to give her a discount so she can!"
brian,"Your mother and I wanted to talk to you, Jake, but this not talking didn't help!"
kathy,Don't blame this on him.
jake,"It's okay, I'm talking now! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'll never do that again. I promise. Dad, I promise."
brian,"Jake, calm down."
jake,I have a great idea.
brian,"Let me explain to you, Jake. Grandpa Max left this house not just for the three of us here."
jake,I know. He loved Leonor too. Tony told me!
brian,"He liked Leonor, of course, but he left the house for us, and also for Aunt Audrey."
jake,"But I have an idea! I know how we can make it work! We go back to our old apartment, and we rent this place and give the money to Aunt Audrey. Tony and I are both going to be at the LaGuardia High School for Performing Arts in Manhattan, so I won't need to take the subway or anything to school. I can walk. And you'll be closer to the theater. I loved the show, Dad. I loved it. Tony did too. We both talked about it a lot afterwards. You were so good! And I thought it was really complex and everything. I'm sorry I didn't tell you then. I'm sorry. But I loved it. I really did!"
park ranger,Mr. Jardine?
brian,"How are you, Son?"
jake,"I'm sorry, Dad."
brian,What happened?
jake,There was a bump on the path...
park ranger,"We got a call from a woman who saw Jake here flying through the air and landing on the asphalt. When we found him, he couldn't move."
jake,I'm better now.
park ranger,He is better. But he probably shouldn't be on his own at his age.
jake,"There was a bump, I didn't see."
brian,Are you hurt?
park ranger,"He fell on his right side shoulder, and he scraped his knee."
brian,Let's go home.
kathy,Is it okay like this?
jake,Yeah. Go slow.
kathy,And how's your arm? Can you move it okay?
jake,It hurts when I go like this.
brian,Dad had a heating pad that he used to use. I can't find it.  You know where it is?
kathy,I think it's in the hall closet. I'll get it in a minute.
brian,Do you still have a lot to do to finish your portfolio?
jake,"I just need to finish one painting, and then I'm done."
brian,That's what you said last week. You just had to finish one painting.
jake,I want them to be good.
brian,"Jake, do you by any chance remember that story I told you, about my friend Tina?"
jake,The one who sold her hair in India for a train ticket?
brian,"No, that was Martine. Tina was a girl I knew in high school who was a dancer. Her mother was a dancer. She was literally born to be a dancer. She had a perfect ballet dancer's body, and all of us were certain she was going to be a big success."
jake,Have I seen her dance?
brian,"No. During high school, she got into a really good conservatory, and I ran into her a couple of times after that, and she was always about to get this, or about to get that. But each time, her arm would be in a sling, or she would be on crutches. She would have a pulled ligament. Or a stress fracture in her back. The last time I saw her, I ran into her on the subway, it was clear she hadn't danced for years. She was fat. You would have never imagined that she was the same girl."
jake,"Gee, thanks Dad. That's a very encouraging story."
brian,Why do you think Tina didn't go very far?
jake,I don't know.
brian,She trained too hard. She practiced too much. She didn't trust her own natural abilities.
brian,"Jake, you're going to meet a lot of really talented people in your life. But they won't all be suited to be artists, they won't all have the brains to know when to insist, and when to stop. When to push yourself, and when to relax. Most of them won't have that balance."
jake,And how do I know if I have the balance?
brian,"That's why I'm telling you this, because you'll turn in your portfolio soon, and they're going to love it. They're going to love you. I know they will. You'll go to LaGuardia, and you'll have fun, but also plenty of challenges. Soon enough you'll find out if you have the balance."
brian,There you go. Do you know if Tony got in?
jake,I don't know. I don't know what he's doing.
brian,Son. I wish I'd done things differently.
jake,What do you mean?
brian,"With Tony, and his mother. I wish I had told you earlier what was going on."
jake,Would it have changed anything?
brian,"No, probably not. But still."
jake,"Dad, would you mind if I give you some advice? Would that be okay."
brian,Please.
jake,Don't worry so much.
jake,That's all.
brian,That's a lot.
jake,"Dad, would you mind if I play one of my video games? I know it's Tuesday, and I know I should do something more productive with my time, but I'm kind of tired."
brian,"Of course, Son."
jake,Will Mom be mad?
brian,I don't think so.
jake,Yours looks different too.
tony,I went to Africa to visit my dad.
jake,How was it?
tony,Amazing.
jake,And how's your mom?
tony,She's busy. She's a real estate agent now.
jake,You could've sent me an email from Africa.
tony,You know me. I'm not much of a writer...
jake,I love that necklace.
tony,"Thanks. They make these for tourists, they don't really wear them there. But I like it too."
jake,"Hey, you should come meet my buddies from school."
tony,Did you get into LaGuardia?
jake,I did.
tony,That's awesome!
jake,"There's this girl in my class, her mother is on Broadway, she can act better than anyone I know."
tony,"Gee, thanks."
jake,We should all go out together sometime.
tony,"Sure, but I met this girl in Kinshasa, and my heart belongs to her. Do you want to see a picture?"
jake,Sure.
tony,She's a really good kisser. She's going to come to visit soon.
jake,Cool.
tony,"And you, have you kissed anyone yet?"
jake,"No, but I've met someone.  You'll meet him."
tony,"You know! Finally, you know!"
tony,"I'm here with a friend from Congo. Let's go find him. He's teaching me French, and I help him with his English - he says ""bitchful"", like... ""This sculpture is so `bitchful'""."
