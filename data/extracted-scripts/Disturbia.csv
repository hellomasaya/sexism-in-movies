kale,"Whoa, did you see that thing?"
jeff,"Settle down, slow it down..."
jeff,"You don't want to scare him off. You've got his attention, now just play with him. Tease him a little."
kale,Holy shit!
jeff,"It's all you, Kale, keep cranking!"
kale,I need reinforcements!
jeff,"Heave, laddie!"
kale," Dad, your pirate -- impersonation -- sucks!!"
jeff,"How would ya know, have ya ever met one? I doubt it --"
kale,He's freakin' pulling us in!
jeff, Never! No Brecht has ever -- lost a fight -- to a fish!
kale, That fish is going down.
jeff, Let's nab the bastard.
julie,You're kidding. So I can actually put the burgers away this time?
kale,"Yes, be gone with the red meat!"
jeff, We're having fish for a week.
kale,DAD --
jeff,"Kale?   -- Kale, are you okay?"
kale,I think so.
kale,"Oh my God, dad --"
jeff,"I'm fine. But you're gonna have to climb out, Kale. Can you do that?"
kale,I can't -- It won't give --
jeff,"That's okay, I've got it -- grab the door, I don't need your ass falling on my face --"
kale,"Dad, here --"
jeff,"Kale, you have to climb up --"
kale,No -- I'm not leaving --
jeff,Kale --
kale,"NO -- Dad, please, I've got you --"
jeff, I know --
minnie tyco," Keep dreaming, perv."
senor gutierrez,Senor Brecht...
ronnie,Dude --
senor gutierrez,"So Kale, think you can stay conscious long enough to tell us your plans for the three wondrous summer months ahead?"
kale,Este invierno --
senor gutierrez, Verano...
kale,Este verano -- voy a --
senor gutierrez,Qu?
kale,"I don't know, alright?    I haven't gotten that far."
senor gutierrez,Did you do the homework or not?
kale, Guess not.
senor gutierrez," You ""guess"" not. I don't know who you think you are or who you think you're dealing with. You can't give me a straight answer, fine, give me one good reason why I shouldn't fail you right now?"
judge,"Okay, Mr. Brecht..."
julie,What if he accidentally goes beyond --
parker," Red light flashes. Means you've got about ten seconds to get your butt back to green, or else --"
kale,The execution squad shows up?
parker,"And they don't bring blindfolds. It's also tamper proof and waterproof. So don't try sticking your foot in a bucket of water and hopping across the line. It won't work, and you'll look stupid. Now, I'll be checking up on you a lot. Here's my card -- You're set up to pay his incarceration fee, Ms. Brecht?"
julie,Automatic withdrawal.  Twelve bucks every day.
parker," Oh, except this -- House arrest might sound like a breeze, but trust me, I've seen all kinds of folks get a bit loopy before too long, some after just a day or two. So make sure you find lots of constructive things to keep yourself busy."
kale," Hobby, you read me? I said come around my left flank and draw his fire -- damn straight I'm trying to get you smoked, you've been hiding behind my ass the whole game --"
julie,"Dinner's on the table. I'm closing at the restaurant the next few nights. Could be some late ones, but hey... the extra tips couldn't hurt."
kale,I got nothin'.
julie,"Y'know, when we're finally free of all this legal stuff with the accident, the other families' lawyers... there might be a little insurance money left... maybe you should go back and see Dr. Phillips?"
kale,"What, so he can tell me I'm ADD, have PTSD, and severe IAD?"
julie,IAD?
kale, Freakin' irritated ankle disorder.
julie,"Well, that one could've been avoided."
kale," C'mon, bid a dollar, one dollar --"
julie, More trash TV?
kale, News.
julie,The lawyer's sending some papers over.
kale,And your point is?
julie," I've got two open houses, you've gotta sign for them. That's the point."
kale,You canceled my Xbox subscription.
kale,That might be difficult.
julie,Well let me make it easier.
kale,"That's a little dramatic, isn't it? I'm just gonna plug it back --"
julie, One more look at that kitchen and I will be.
kale,Yes!
kale,"Wait, Ronnie -- Hello?"
kale,GODDAMMIT!
kale,I'm coming!!
kale,Oh shit!   Shit water shit!
kale,You think that's funny?
kale,Not before I shove this shit up your ass!
kale,Shit!
kale," Okay, fine, but if I'd known --"
courier,"Hi, I'm from McNeill-Stewart law firm, dropping off for Ms. Julie --"
kale,"Hey doggie, come here..."
ronnie," Aloooha Senor Ka-- Dude, you look like hell."
ronnie,"Seriously man, you need some sun. "
kale," I mean... there's such structure to it, so many layers, but it's invisible if you're not looking close enough..."
ronnie,What are you talking about?
kale,The world right outside the window.
ronnie,-- Fascinating.
kale, Three... two... one... dog...
ronnie,Husband?
kale, Maid.
ronnie,"Great, that still doesn't explain why you're in a bathrobe at four in the afternoon."
kale, Will you just look --
ronnie,"Dude, he's gonna see --"
kale,"He can't. We don't have any lights on. Plus the angle's sharper from ground level, it only seems like he could see us. I did the math."
ronnie,"Oh, you did the math."
kale,"Optical illusion, line-of-sight doesn't apply to the subject."
ronnie,Kale --
kale,Now tilt your gaze up...
ronnie,DAMN!!
kale,"C'mon, there's more."
ronnie,"What, I go to Maui, you become a stalker?"
kale,"No, stalking's for psychos. These are just simple observations... natural side effects of chronic boredom."
ronnie," Find your passion, Kale."
kale, So... Robert Giles...
ronnie,"Huh, I guess he likes his grass short."
kale,"Next to him is Judy Thorp. Dude, she freakin' sneaks over to her neighbors' every morning, steals their newspaper, I guess reads it or swipes the coupons, then puts it back before they even wake up."
ronnie, People. You never can tell these days.
ronnie,What was that?
kale,Last stop on the tour.
ronnie,Oh-- my-- God. Who be she?
kale,Don't know.
ronnie,What's stopping you?!
ashley,Can I help you?
kale,"Nope, no I'm fine."
ashley, Too late.
kale,"Thanks, that was really humiliating."
ashley,Please. I think any pride you had left was gone a while ago.
kale,"Oh, you mean that thing with the cops? They had the wrong guy, total foul up. I'm Kale by the way."
ashley,Still going.
kale,"I'd help, but...  I'm a little spatially challenged at the moment."
ashley,"Yeah, you've kinda got the whole Martha Stewart thing going on --"
kale, So where'd you move from?
ashley,"I'm a city girl. Born, raised, and now...  Forcefully relocated."
kale,That doesn't sound good.
ashley,"I'm telling you, if I have another clueless jock hit on me or one more soccer mom cuts me off in her oversize SUV, I'm gonna go postal."
kale,"Oh, sorry, I was just gonna see if you wanted to hop in my Hummer and cruise to a kegger.  Nice talking to you."
ashley," Wait, I --"
ashley," My mom -- she's very polite, always says ""please"" but she's got that tone, did you notice?"
kale,I know the tone.
ashley," Oh, I'm Ashley --"
kale,"Noticed that, too."
kale, You started without me?
kale, -- Mustang --
kale,"What?   No, I --"
julie,What's going on?
kale,"Nothing, just watching the wind blow."
julie, Anything else?
kale,"No, see for yourself."
julie," That's okay, I just... wanted to say good night."
kale," '65 or '66, couldn't tell."
ronnie,Check this out. The feds think your missing girl might be related to three murders in Austin. All redheads.
kale,Movement.
ronnie,Dude...
kale, That's definitely new.
ronnie,"Oh, it's so warm, baby..."
kale,Jackass!
ronnie,"Dude, there's no way she heard that."
kale,"Dick, my deaf aunt in Omaha heard that."
ronnie, She's got great lung capacity.
kale, I think she saw me --
ronnie,There's no way --
kale,Seriously?
ronnie,Her swims always that short?
kale," No, she usually takes her time --"
ronnie,Now where is she?
ronnie,"Don't, it could be her!"
kale,It's not gonna be her.
ronnie,Then stop!    Just -- let 'em go away.
kale,I have to.
ronnie,What?!   What?! Speak.
kale,It's her.
ronnie,You're full of --
kale,She totally saw us --
ronnie,We are so busted. Don't answer it!
kale," Dude, she knows I'm here."
ashley,What took you so long?  The house isn't that big.
kale,"Yeah, no, we were playing upstairs --"
ronnie, Video games...?
kale, So... what brings you here.
ashley,Oh.   -- Locked out.
kale,Do you need to call anyone?
ashley,"Thanks, but I'd rather stay stranded if you don't mind."
kale,"Uh, sure, come on in --"
ashley,"Nice to meet you. Video games, huh?  I like to play."
kale,Excuse me...
kale,It's a little messy.
ashley,A little?
ronnie," Actually, he is."
ashley,Is that so.
ronnie,"Exhibit A, Robert Giles."
ashley,"Yeah, I've seen him.   So?"
kale,So you hear about that missing girl from Madison?
ashley," What, you think he --"
kale,He drives a car like the one she was seen in.
ronnie,Black Mustang.
kale,60's era Mustang.
ashley,"Gee, that really narrows it down."
kale,They said it was dented.     His has a bashed-in fender.
ashley, So this is why -- you're --
ronnie,What?
kale,Hey --
ashley,"So that's the infamous black mustang, huh?"
kale,Yeah --
ashley,The one with no dent?
kale, What?
ashley,Because it was never there in the first place?
kale, She's right.
ronnie,"Austin, Texas. Texas Longhorns."
ashley,"Okay, fine, stakeout.  Who's on my shift?"
ronnie,This is all the stuff I could find --
ashley,Do you know how long Giles has lived there?
kale,About two or three years.
ashley,"So he could've lived in Texas...  Hey, check this out."
ronnie,"""Murderer: Tell Tale Signs of a Serial Killer."" Qualifies for free shipping if you pair it with ""The Shrine of Jeffrey Dahmer."""
ashley,"The summary lists four main criteria. Our guy meets at least three. White male between the age of twenty-five and fifty. He doesn't have any pets, right?"
kale,Not that I've seen --
ashley,You said he lives alone --
ronnie,What's the fourth?
ashley, Sexual dysfunction.
kale, He's been gone awhile.
ashley, Here.
kale,How'd you get my phone?
ashley,I'm crafty like that.
kale,What'd you do?
ashley,"Every time he calls, that's what you'll hear."
kale,What the hell?
ashley, Three to one he doesn't pick it up.
kale,So that's why the grass is greener...
ashley,Only in disturbia...
kale,So why the move?
ashley,"What do you mean? The greener grass, the safer pastures..."
kale,"No, seriously."
ashley,"Well, I guess my mom thought it'd help keep dad on a shorter leash. City life... had its temptations...  But my mom pretty much cries just as much as she always did, and dad doesn't care -- more than ever."
kale,"What did they think, an extra bathroom and two-car garage would actually change things... somehow protect them and you from all that crap you can never escape?"
ashley,"Something like that.  So... what're your issues, Kale?"
kale,That's him.
ashley,Another car --
kale,No.
ashley, Cute for a killer.
kale,How do you know?
ashley,"Bright green bracelet's ""The Pyramids,"" purple's ""Club 360,"" the big black stamp's from ""Flavor."""
kale, Your I.D. must be pretty good.
ashley, I don't need one.
kale,He's going in.
ashley,Denied...
kale,What do you think they're listening to?
ashley,Could be radio. See if you can find the station.
ronnie, Hmmm...
ashley,Now's the time to bust your move.
ronnie, Who's that?
ashley," I'm at Barnes and Noble.    Okay, I'm leaving. No, I'll walk."
kale,And she's down for the count.
ashley,Looks like this is as far as you go.
kale,Looks like.
ashley,"Y'know, I have to admit, you're different than I expected."
kale,What were you expecting?
ashley,I thought you'd be more messed up.
kale,Does that disappoint you? 'Cause I can be more messed up if you want me to.
ashley,"No, you're fine."
kale,"""Fine?"""
ashley,Yeah.
kale,"""Fine"" like your first cousin ""fine"" or ""fine"" in kind of a Brad Pitt sorta way?"
giles," Just come back in the house, you shouldn't drive --"
ashley,He wants her to come back in --
kale,I can't hear --
ashley,Let's get closer --
kale, I can't --
giles,You really should stay.
woman,I just don't think it's a good idea --  Where the hell are they?
giles,You're in no condition --
woman,Give me my keys.
giles,Sorry.
kale," Ashley, come on..."
ashley, That was intense.
kale,Are you nuts?!
kale,Mom?
kale,Dammit.
kale,Giles totally busted me.
kale,They were arguing --
kale,"Giles and the girl he brought home. They had an argument, he grabbed her --"
kale,And then -- nothing.
kale,"Dude, something is going on over there. What if he killed her, too?"
kale,Wait --
kale,A door just slammed.
kale,"Asshole, I'm serious."
kale,Just -- wait -- wait till I check the hall --
kale,Goddamn you!!
julie,"Kale, Kale, it's me!!"
kale,"No, don't!"
julie,"What's going on, who were you talking to?!"
kale,Ronnie -- just Ronnie.
julie,"I'm sorry, the wind caught it --"
kale,Fine.   Good.     Okay --
julie,"Okay then, so...  You want anything from the grocery? I'm going in the morning."
kale,Anything caffeinated.
giles, Behind you?
kale,"I know, how did you --"
giles, Think I startled him.
julie," Oh. Kale, I ran into Mr. Giles at --"
giles,Robert...
julie," ...At the grocery. I had a flat tire when I came out. We tried to change it, but --"
kale,Dad put those security bolts on --
julie,And that adapter thingy that unscrews it ended up stripping it instead --
giles,My fault.
julie,"No, it wasn't. You saved my life.  We had it towed to Frank's."
kale," Gee, really lucky you were there."
giles,Just glad I could help.  Must be a little difficult when the man of the house is stuck in the house.
julie,"Oh... no, it's okay, we're managing."
giles,"I've always been curious about those things, do you mind?"
kale,"Yeah, I do."
julie,"Oh c'mon, Kale.  I'm sorry."
giles,"No, no.   It's none of my business."
kale,That's right.
giles,"Whoa, hey, dude... you seem like a straight hitter. You ask me, whoever they are deserved it."
julie," Okay... I don't think that's the case, and --"
kale,I think I'd like to hear his opinion.
giles,And I think I opened my big mouth again. You're absolutely right.  I should go.
julie,"Wait, what about your coffee?"
kale,I popped my Spanish teacher.
giles,"In that case, cafe con leche, por favor?"
julie," Shoot, milk's... still in the car."
kale,"I like your shirt, by the way.    I mean, the color."
giles,Which one?
kale,"Oh, the... that dark orange.   Always reminds me of Texas."
giles,"Yeah?   You a Longhorns fan, too?"
kale,"Sure, absolutely. Even though I've never stepped foot in Texas --"
giles,Me neither. Had a lot of friends who went there. I stayed in Minnesota till I moved here.
kale,Huh.
giles,"So when you say you ""popped"" your teacher --"
kale,Just a black eye.
giles,"Phew, just making sure I wasn't living next to some psycho killer. Listen, I get it though. I had plenty of teachers I wanted to just... kill."
julie,"Kale, could you grab the sugar?  Sugar?"
giles, Why not.
kale,"I know, he's a total freak, right?"
ashley,"And very vague... did he genuinely mean it was nice meeting you or was he sending you a ""sinister message?"""
kale,Are you messing with me?
ashley,Maybe a little. Did you even notice my hair?
kale,So you think it's all a coincidence. We've got the car --
ashley,With the non dent dent --
kale,"The bumper sticker, the argument, the staring contest -- And now he's showing up in my kitchen --"
ashley,"Why, because he slashed your mom's tire?"
kale,Maybe.
ashley,"It's called ""the day after,"" Kale. Nobody moves after a night like that."
kale,"Well what if she's really ""not moving?"" What if she's tied in the dungeon with the other girl, starving to death --"
ashley, Then come up with a rescue plan and get back to me.
kale,You're leaving?
ashley,Have to.    Party.
kale,Whose?
ashley,"Uh, mine?"
kale,How is that possible?
ashley,Excuse me?
kale,"Well, I mean... Sorry, I just didn't think you knew anybody --"
ashley,"I don't, I didn't --  I met this girl earlier, Minnie Tyco?"
kale,"Oh my god, ""Skinny Psycho?!"" I sat next to that bitch in Spanish --"
ashley, I told her my parents were outta town --
kale,And now the whole neighborhood's coming.
ashley,"Look, I'm stuck here. So I figured I can either shut myself in and keep hating it or... try to make the most of it."
kale,"Hey, I get it. You don't have to explain."
ashley,"Kale, you're welcome to come, but --"
kale," Well, I appreciate the thought. Really."
ashley, Glad to hear it.
kale,"It's funny, though."
ashley, What?
kale,I didn't peg you as a conformist.
ashley,"Try to keep these in your drawers tonight, will ya?"
ronnie," This is Ronnie, leave a message."
kale," -- Yeah, I guess anything's possible."
kale,Hey!
ashley, Oh my God --
ashley,Back off or I'll throw it where you can't follow.
kale,"Take it easy, that's sixty gigs of my life."
ashley,Even better.
kale,Okay -- okay --
ashley,What are you doing?
kale,What are you doing?
ashley,"I'm trying to enjoy my party. Wait, that's wrong. According to you, I'm trying to conform --"
kale,Coulda fooled me.
ashley,What does that mean?
kale,Forget --
ashley,"No, I'm not gonna forget it."
kale,"You wanna blend in with that crowd, fine, then stop looking up and trying to get a rise outta me."
ashley, So you were watching me. Question is for how long? Just tonight?    Or maybe a week? Two weeks? Since I moved in?
kale,It's not a cover --
ashley,"So what is it, Kale?   Huh?   What else have you seen?"
kale,What else have I seen?
ashley,Yeah.   What else?
kale,"Okay -- I've seen how you always pull your kleenex from the box in groups of three. Not two, not four, always three. I've seen you're the only one in the world who eats pizza- flavored Pringles. And you never stuff the chips in, you savor each one by dividing it into four precise bites. I didn't know that was even possible. You're also the first girl I've ever seen who spends more time on her roof than in her own house. And what do you do out there? You don't talk on the phone, you don't paint your nails, you read books. Now one would think with the whole numbers thing you've got going on that you'd put them on your shelf alphabetically, but you don't. Your system's much more perfect. The ones you like go on the bottom, the ones you love go in the middle, and the ones you need, the ones you keep going back to... well they go straight to the top next to the dream encyclopedia. You know what all this tells me? You know how things should be. The world according to Ashley. And guess what? It's a very entertaining and beautiful thing. Even when it takes a hit. When you end up in a place like this... when your parents dump their baggage on you, or just... when it seems like those curveballs are never gonna stop -- It sucks, but just so you know -- I get it. "
ashley,That was either the creepiest... or the sweetest thing I've ever heard.
kale,Hey.
ashley,Hey... where have you been?
kale,"If would have gone to the flower shop, but --"
ashley,I know.
kale,"Oh, two months, twelve days, nineteen hours give or take."
ashley,...For a guy who killed his teacher.
kale,I didn't kill my --
ashley,Shhh.  I know. -- I know.
kale,Three-thirty.
ashley,I've gotta go.
kale,You better see this.
ashley,What?
kale, Her car... still hasn't moved...
ashley,So what do you wanna do?
ronnie, You want me to do what?
kale,"Phase one, steal his code from his opener."
ronnie,There's more than one phase?
kale,"There's only two. Now look, his remote's in the glove compartment of his Toyota. All you have to do is pop it open and read me the switch settings. ""On"" or ""off."""
ronnie,For the later purpose of doing what? Breaking in to his house?
kale,"No, not breaking in. We're just talking about having access to his garage so we can go in on our own time - when he's not there - to just... to get a closer look at the car, the bag --"
ronnie, All this sounds reasonable to you?
ashley,"I don't know about that, but --"
kale, This is good up to thirteen digits --
ronnie, How long have you been planning this?
kale,"Look, if we're gonna do this, it's gotta be now. He takes twenty-one minutes average to mow his front yard... you'll be hearing him the whole time..."
ashley,I'll do it.
ronnie,No.  Let's do it.
kale," Yo, you set?"
kale,"Let me conference Ashley in.  Ashley, you there?"
kale,Nice.
kale,You okay --
kale,"Dude, glove compartment, other side."
kale,"Well, while you're there, will you just check?"
kale,You see the package?
kale,Whenever you're ready.
kale,Just start over.
kale,"No, no --"
kale,"Ronnie, he's coming around."
kale," Ronnie, I am not dicking with you. The neighbor is also mowing her lawn and he's going to see you --"
kale,GET IN THE CAR!!
kale,Easy on the door.
kale,"Back seat, NOW!"
ronnie," Kale, tell my mom --"
kale,"Shut up, stay down and don't move."
ronnie, Excuse me?
kale," The code, did you get it?"
ronnie,You've gotta be kidding.
kale, No way.
ronnie," Great, Kale. She lives."
kale,Getting her license number --
ronnie,Why?
ashley,"Okay, case closed."
ronnie,Try telling Inspector Clouseau that. Now he thinks he needs her license number.
ashley,"Why, Kale?   It's over."
kale,"""Yeah, he seemed like such a normal guy. Sure he kept to himself, but he was always nice to me."" That's what they all say. That's what all the neighbors always say -- after the fact. Only after they've caught the guy, after he's killed thirty people --"
ashley,"Okay, I think we all just need to take a breath."
kale, Can anyone tell me that?
ashley,"Kale, why are you so --"
kale," Ronnie, you've seen this satellite website, right? You can find any location on earth and take a picture --"
ronnie,"Yeah, for a small fee --"
ashley,"Kale, what are you doing?"
kale,Trying to get to the bottom of this.
ashley," Kale, right now, it doesn't look that way."
kale,What's it look like?
ashley,Like you're determined to turn Giles in to who you think he is.
kale,Not who I think.
ashley, I just didn't realize -- you were this --
kale,"What, crazy?     Maybe I am.   But maybe I'm right."
ashley,"It's not about that, it's about --  I'm seeing you sitting at your dad's desk --"
kale,Are you two gonna help me or not?
ashley,I want to.
kale, Then start looking through these --
ashley,That's not what I meant.
kale," Well, this is all I need, so -- I guess I'll see you later."
ronnie,"I would, dude, but -- I've gotta pull it together and -- change my underwear. Catch you later?"
kale,Sure.
kale,"Get off me, man."
ronnie,Dude -- my cell phone's -- still in his car.
kale," Ronnie, I know you think I'm losing my mind, but... listen, I'll help you get it, I just need you to do one thing."
ronnie, Phase two. I knew it.
kale, You read?
kale,"Got video, no audio."
kale,"Light on, far end."
kale, No movement.
kale,"Stay calm, it's there."
kale,"You're still clear, check the bag."
kale,Try to get the plate number of the Mustang and check for dents --
kale,The camera's sliding --
kale,Ronnie?
ronnie, -- make it -- interference -- somebody's here --
kale,Ronnie?!
kale,Ronnie?!
kale,Hey!
kale,"Please, my friend's been kidnapped, he's in this house -- he's inside, I think the owner's trying to kill him --"
kale,It was already open.
giles,"Uh, yes, can I help you, officer?"
giles," No, I certainly wouldn't."
kale,You're a lying son of a bitch!
kale,"He's in there, goddammit!   He's inside! He's lying!"
kale,"Okay, but he's lying -- he has my friend, and he kidnapped that girl last week, he killed maybe three others, all redheads, they could be in a bag -- a big blue plastic bag -- in his garage -- my friend knew this --  That's why he's covering -- he didn't just wake up five minutes ago --"
giles,"Absolutely, be my guest."
giles," I hit it the other night. Thought I'd save a few steps and get it off the road myself. I was gonna bury it sooner, but it's been a helluva week --"
kale,"So why'd you have to have the car fixed in record time, huh? Because it was covered in her blood --"
giles," Because it's a classic, I got it out of storage for the auto show, I needed it in pristine condition."
giles,"Please, I understand."
kale," So where's my friend, then? Can anyone tell me that? Does anyone believe me?!"
julie,"Kale, come on --"
julie," I'm sorry, Kale."
kale,Mom --
julie,Let me finish -- because I have to tell you something...  I feel like I let you down. I was too caught up in my own grief to see straight. I thought time would heal this and taking a second job was... the answer to keeping a roof over our heads --
kale,It was --
julie, I want us to be us again. I want us to be honest with each other like we used to be. Is that possible?
kale,Yeah. I just -- didn't think you'd believe me --
julie,"Listen to me. I am always on your side. No matter what. It may not look like it sometimes, but it's the truth. And we'll get through this. Okay?"
kale,OH MY GOD --
ronnie,BOO!
kale,How -- How long have you been here?
ronnie,"You should have seen your face --  I got out his front door. I got lucky. I heard you yelling, but dude, cops were everywhere --"
kale,"Still, you could have --"
ronnie,"What, popped out and said, ""oh yeah, officers, my friend's right, I was just in that house, I'd gone to get my cell phone out of the guy's car I broke into earlier..."" Are you kidding me?"
kale, I get it.
ronnie,"Dude, I am sorry. Can we just... hug it out?"
kale,"Why didn't Giles tell the cops someone broke in? I mean, he did see you, right?"
ronnie,"You know, let's be positive for a change. I thought he did, but maybe he didn't. Or maybe he's a nice guy afterall, and he didn't wanna make a big deal of it, you know? I mean, he's a guy, he was a kid once..."
kale,What if he wasn't always a guy?
ronnie,But I do have to ask... what was in the bag?
kale, Dead deer.
ronnie,"Naturally...  Hey, you want more evidence, detective?"
kale,"I was watching, remember?"
ronnie,"No, no, this is comedy, it deserves big screen treatment."
