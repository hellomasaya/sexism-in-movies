Speaker,Dialogue
old woman,Oh my God! ... Why they doin that?
old man,Who the hell knows.  What you have in your mouth?
marietta,Hello...  Who is this?...
sailor, ...Sailor Ripley...  Can I talk to Lula?
marietta,Theres no way in hell you can speak to her and...
sailor, What?...
marietta,...Yes you heard me...  Dont ever call back here again.
lula,Mama???
marietta,"You know who it was and you know you arent, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER...  End of story."
lula, Like hell.
teenagers,EAT SHIT MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!
beany,I can dig this music...  But not that singer.
lula,Why?...  Hes right in the groove.
beany,Hes so ugly.  Guys with beards and beer guts aint quite my type.
lula," Seeins how youre about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, dont know how you can criticize."
beany,"Yeah, well, if he says that all that flab turns into dick at midnight, hes a liar."
beany,"So, Sailors gettin out soon, and youre gonna see him?"
lula,"Meetin him at the gate.  That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mamas hid the keys to my car.  But of course, I know exactly where they are."
beany,"I didnt hate me so much, Id feel better wishin you luck."
lula,"Cant all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo probly wouldnta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadnt kicked his ass out."
beany,So youre gonna be needin the blue-bird pretty soon?
lula,"Real soon ... Ill be makin the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany."
marietta,Wheres Johnnie?  Hes not in his office.
bartender,"Havent seen im yet today, Marietta."
marietta, Well I gotta find him - right this minute!
lula,Hey baby...
sailor,Peanut...
sailor,"Hey, my snakeskin jacket...  Thanks, baby...  Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?"
lula,"Bout fifty thousand times.  I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?...  I hear Powermads at The Hurricane."
sailor, Stab it and steer.
lula,Did you ever think somethin like about the wicked witch of the east comin flyin in?...  Did you ever think somethin and then later think youve said it out loud to someone?
sailor,"I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey.  The rest of you, too, of course.  But the way your head works is Gods own private mystery.  What was it you was thinkin?"
lula,"Well, I was thinkin about smokin actually...  My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole em from her beginnin in about sixth grade.  When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now Ive just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed?  Theyre longer."
sailor,I guess I started smokin when I was about six...  My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
lula,What brandd she smoke?
sailor,"Camels, same as me...  Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness."
lula,"Gee, Sailor.  Im sorry, honey.  I never would have guessed it."
sailor,"Its okay.  I hardly used to see them anyway.  I didnt have much parental guiding.  The public defender kept sayin that at my parole hearin. He was a good ol boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time."
lula,"Id stand by you, Sailor ... through anything."
sailor,"Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon.  A man cant ask for more than that."
lula,"You move me, Sailor, you really do. You mark me the deepest."
sailor,"Youre perfect for me, too."
lula,"You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies.  He had a long nose, too, like theirs.  Did I ever tell you how he died?"
sailor,"In a fire, as I recall."
lula,Started he couldnt remember things? Got real violent?  Mama kept tellin me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin the old paint off our house without usin a mask...  But I dont know.  Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
clyde,FUCKIN BITCH!!!!
lula,"Finally in the middle of the one night, with me and mama asleep upstairs ... he poured kerosene over himself and lit a match."
lula, Near burned down the house.  We got out just in time.
lula,It was a year before I met you.
sailor,"You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan."
lula,"Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck.  It was like on a statue it was so white?"
marietta,"I knew this would happen.  Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew thered be trouble. Hes just got some kind of influence over her I cant decipher.  Theres somethin wild in Lula I dont know where it comes from.  You gotta find em, Johnnie."
johnnie,"He served his time for what he did. Another thing...  If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there aint much can be done about it."
marietta,"Dont talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut.  I know what volition means, and thats why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet!  Hes pure slime and its leakin all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin some kinda move and then kill him dead.  Youd only be defendin yourself, and with his record, nobodyd fuss."
johnnie,"Ill locate Lula, Marietta, and if shes with the Ripley boy, Ill give him a talkin to and try to convince her to come back with me. Thats about all I can do."
marietta,Ill hire a hit man if you dont want to help me stop this thing.  Ill call Marcello Santos.
johnnie,"Now, Marietta, I am goin to help you. And dont be gettin carried away. You dont want to be bringin Santos and his people into it."
marietta,Youre just jealous of Santos cause hes sweet on me.
johnnie,"Darlin, you aint seein Santos again, are ya?"
marietta,"Oh, Johnnie Farragut...  Dont you trust your very own Marietta?"
johnnie,"Sorry, sweetheart.  Bein in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side."
marietta,Well stop worryin about me and start worryin about how youre gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
johnnie,"Sailor aint a murderer.  You got to get off that kick.  And fars I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin Lula.  Even there he was protectin her.  You oughta be thankin him for that.  That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin after the both of em.  Why am I tellin you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened.  Sailor just got a little too forceful is all...  You remember that night..."
marietta,"Maybe I was there, but I didnt see anythin.  All I knows that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now probly all over my baby!"
johnnie,"Marietta, settle down now darlin... I want whats best for her, too - Like I said, Ill do what I can to bring her home."
lula,"Sailor, you are somethin else, honey...  When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon Id be startin to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it."
sailor,"But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen."
lula,"Thats true.  Uncle Pooch wasnt really an uncle.  He was a business partner of my daddys?  And my mama never knew nothin about me and him - thats for damn sure.  His real name was somethin kind of European, like Pucinski.  But everyone just called him Pooch.  He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised moren a little."
sailor,"Howd it happen, peanut?  He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?"
lula,"Youre terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?"
sailor,I cant hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
lula,I said you can be too crude sometimes? I dont think I care for it.
sailor,"Sorry, sugar.  Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed."
lula,"Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin her hair dyed?  And I was alone in the house."
lula," Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know?  Where I was makin a jelly and banana sandwich?  I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters.  Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter."
sailor,Didnt he say somethin?
lula,Not really.  Least not so I recall now.
sailor,So howd he finally nail you?  Right there in the kitchen?
lula,"No, he picked me up."
lula," He was short but powerful.  With hairy arms?  Anyway, he carried me into the maids dayroom which nobody used.  We did it there on an old bed."
sailor,We did it?  Whattaya mean?  Didnt he force you?
lula,"Well, sure.  But he was super-gentle, you know?  I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess theres all different kinds of rapes.  I didnt exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didnt seem all that terrible.  It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there.  I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off.  Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin my sandwich."
sailor,And you never told nobody about it?
lula,"Just you.  Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after.  And he never did anything else to me.  I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry? "
lula,"Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin in Myrtle Beach.  They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby...  That government of ours should be keepin us separated from outer space..."
sailor,Here she goes again...
lula,"Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin.  Seems to me the government could do somethin about it.  One of these mornings the sunll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray."
sailor," That aint never will happen, honey. Least not in our lifetime."
sailor,"You okay, honey?"
lula,That womans laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin like that... somewhere before...  Soundd like the wicked witch...
sailor,Just sounded like an old gal havin a good time to me...  You ready to dance?
lula,"Im always ready to dance.  But I need me a kiss first, honey.  Just one?"
santos,I knew youd want it again...
marietta,Thats not why I called.
santos,Oh yeah - sure ... okay.
marietta,Santos...  It isnt.
santos,Have it your way...  But you want it.
marietta,Lulas gone off with Sailor.
santos,What do you want me to do about it?
marietta,"I want you to take care of Sailor, so he wont ever be able to bother my baby again."
santos,Take care of him?
marietta,Yes.
santos,What does take care of him mean?... Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
marietta,Whats with you?...  You know what take care of him means.  I dont call Santos except for one big reason.
santos,"Big is the key word, and Im telling you I want it bad."
marietta,I want you to get rid of Sailor.
santos,Get rid of him?
marietta,Yes...  Get rid of him.
santos,How would I do that?  Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
marietta,"Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin this stupid game?"
santos,Just tell me what you want.
marietta,I dont need to explain anymoren I have...  You know damn well.
santos,You need to explain it.
marietta,All right...  I want you ... to ... kill ... Sailor...  As simple as that.
santos,Simple?  Kill him?...  How?
marietta,Thats your business...  I dont care how.
santos,Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
marietta,"NO...  For Gods sakes, Santos!"
santos,"Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?"
marietta,Santos...
santos,Explain it...  I told you.
marietta,Shoot him.
santos,Shoot him?  Like with a gun?
marietta,Yes.
santos,Where?...  In the leg?
marietta,No.
santos,Where?
marietta,In the head.
santos,Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun...  Now Im beginning to get it...  You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
marietta,Yes.
santos,"But where in the head?...  Not the chin, I hope."
marietta,No...  In the brains...  What little Im sure he has.
santos,You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
marietta,Yes.
santos,Through the forehead?
marietta,Yes.
santos,Wrong!  Its much better to blow a hole in the back of the head ... right toward the bridge of the nose ...  Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
marietta,See!  I knew you had it all under control.
santos,Why didnt you send Johnnie Farragut?
marietta,Maybe I did...  Try New Orleans first... Lula cant ever stop talkin bout that town.
santos,On one condition...
santos,You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
marietta," Santos...  No...  Please, Santos..."
santos,Youre not tellin me that youre sweet on him?
marietta,No...  But...
santos,"One day hes gonna find out what were up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble."
santos,Im gonna take your silence as a yes...
marietta,Santos...  I cant...
santos,"Shhhh...  Its all right...  Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed."
marietta,"You fucker, dont you ever touch Lula -  You fucker, Ill kill you."
santos, Put your shoulders back.
marietta,What?
santos,"Put your shoulders back, I said."
santos,You got nice tits.
marietta,Someones gonna see us.
santos, Thats just another part of the price to pay.
marietta,"Santos...  You kill that Sailor, otherwise hes gonna turn my baby against me."
santos,Look at me...  Theres no turning back on this...  Im gonna kill Sailor... Thats for sure.
sailor,Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl?  Or are you gonna save youself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
idiot punk,"Dont fuck with me, man.  You look like a clown in that stupid jacket."
sailor,"This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me its a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom."
idiot punk,...Asshole.
sailor, Come here.
lula,"Sailor, honey..."
sailor," Im sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl."
idiot punk, Im sorry.
lula,"Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all."
sailor,Thats good...  Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had...  Yall know this one?...
lula,Why didnt ya sing Love Me Tender? ...  You told me that was your favorite love song.
sailor,Cause Im only gonna sing that song to my wife.
lula,What you want to watch this trash for? Aint one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
sailor,"That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?"
lula,What you have to get personal about so quick?  All I mean is you could possibly read a book.
lula,Whats that honey?
sailor,"We didnt have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?"
lula,"Im sorry, sweetie.  I forget some moments where all you been the last two years."
sailor,"Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all.  Dont need to make moren it was.  This couples goin on a date to Hawaii.  The girl chose him over the other two guys."
lula,Dont the reject guys get anythin?
sailor,Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
lula,That dont seem fair.
sailor,"Hell, why should the Datin Game be different from real life?  At least them boys is gonna get somethin to eat."
lula,Sailor?
sailor,Yeah?
lula,Wouldnt it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
sailor," You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut.  Aint we been doin a pretty fair job this far?"
lula,"Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey?  Itd make the future so simple and nice."
sailor,"At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know?  Gettin out? And what youll do and what youll think about when youre on the outside again."
lula,I just think about things as they come up.  I never been much of a planner.
sailor,"It aint altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I aint too proud of, but Ill tell ya from now on I aint gonna do nothin for no good reason.  All I know for sure is theres moren a few bad ideas runnin around loose out there."
lula,"You know theres somethin I aint never told you about, Sailor, and this heres a story with the lesson that theres a right time and a wrong time for things to happen... When I was almost sixteen I got pregnant."
sailor,"Musta been a lesson tellin ya it was the wrong time...  What did you do, your mama find out?"
lula, She got me an abortion...
lula, ...from some old doctor with the hairiest nostrils and ears I ever seen.
lula, Afterwards...  Momma says...
lula," ...I hope you appreciate my spendin six hundred dollars, not countin what it cost us to get here and back...  This mans the best damn abortionist in the South."
sailor,You tell the boy who knocked you up?
lula,"It was my cousin, Dell, done it?  His folks used to visit with us summers."
sailor,What happened to him?
lula,"Oh, nothin.  I never let on to mama about Dell bein the one.  I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was?  I didnt tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didnt see the point. Somethin terrible happened to him, though.  Six months ago."
sailor,"Whats that, peanut?"
lula,Dell disappeared.  Dell was learnin a hard lesson.  What I learned from observin Dell is I think people who are frightened want to disappear. Hed startin behavin weird?  Like comin up to people every fifteen minutes and askin how they were doin?
dell,Howre ya doin?
lula,And just seemin real spacey and actin funny.
sailor,Actin funny how?
lula,"Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dells mama?  She found cockroaches in Dells underwear."
lula,"One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin one big cockroach on his anus?"
sailor,"Hell, peanut..."
lula,One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.?  She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin sandwiches in the kitchen.
aunt rootie,Whatre ya doin?
dell,Makin my lunch!!!
lula, Dell told her he was makin his lunch and goin to work.  Hes a welder?  And she made him go back to bed.
lula,Then hed carry on about the weather? Talk about how rainfalls controlled by aliens livin on earth.  Also how men wearin black leather gloves...
lula, ...are followin him around.
sailor,Probly the rain boys from Outer Space.
lula,"It aint so funny now, though.  December before Christmas?  Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him.  He was missin for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit."
lula, The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars?  Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would give him peace of mind.  Nobodys seen him since.
sailor,"Sound like ol Dells moren just a little confused, peanut...  Too bad he couldnt visit that ol Wizard of Oz and get some good advice."
lula,"Too bad we all cant, baby...  One thing about Dell?"
sailor,Whats that?
lula,"When he was about seventeen, he startin losin his hair."
sailor,So?
lula,Hes twenty-four now?  A year older than you?  And must be bout bald.
sailor,"Theres worse things that can happen to a man, honey."
lula,"Yeah, I suppose.  But you know somethin baby, hair does make a difference."
lula,I sure am glad they didnt give you no prison haircut...  Gives me somethin to grab hold of while were makin love?
sailor,"Lets go dancin, peanut.  Im ready."
lula,"We gotta be careful, honey, my mamas gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and hes one clever detective?  You know how clever?  He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor."
sailor,"One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... Youre twenty years old - arent you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin us apart? Puttin a detective on us.  Ill tell ya Lula...  Well...  Its moren me killin Bob Ray Lemon..."
lula,Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
sailor,"Yeah, maybe..."
marietta,"Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lulas mama?..."
sailor,No.
marietta,"Well, she wants to fuck you."
old man, Lousy fuckin homosexuals...
sailor," What are you, sick?...  Im with Lula."
marietta,No...  I just wanted to kiss you good-bye...  You know too much bout little Lulas mom...
sailor,Whattya mean?
marietta,"Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos..."
sailor,So?
marietta,"So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire...  And youre gonna get burned, baby...  And besides that, youre shit...  Dyou think Id let my little girl go with shit like you?...  Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets."
sailor,Youre gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
marietta,"Oh, dont worry bout that..."
sailor,"Its a problm I dont thinks gonna go away too soon though...  Peanut, Im thinkin of breakin parole and takin you out to sunny California."
lula,Sailor!
sailor,You up for that?
lula,"Id got to the far end of the world for you, baby...  You know I would."
sailor,Those toenails dry yet?  We got some dancin to do.
lula,"...Thats an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy."
sailor,"Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez.  At that age you still got a lot of energy."
lula,"You still got plenty energy for me, baby."
lula,"Take a picture, bitch...  Itll last longer."
girl,Oh yeah?
lula,Ill slap those eyes right outta your head.
lula,"Sorry, baby...  Whens the first time you done it with a girl who wasnt hookin?"
sailor,"Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kids house whose parents were out of town.  A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me."
sailor, She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.
lula,Whatd you say to her?
sailor,"Told her my name.  Then she said somethin like, Its so noisy down here.  Why dont we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves? She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day."
sailor, When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
lula,"Oh, baby.  What a bad boy you are!"
sailor," Thats just what she said.  I had a boner with a capital O.  I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines.  She was a wild chick.  She was wearin bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin lacy black stripes down the sides.  You know, them kind that doesnt go all the way down your leg?"
lula,You mean like pedal pushers?
sailor,I guess.
sailor, She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air.  I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
lula,"Youre excitin me, honey.  Whatd she do?"
sailor,"Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, I wont suck you.  Dont ask me to suck you."
lula,Poor baby.  She dont know what she missed.  What color hair she have?
sailor,"Sorta brown, blonde, I guess.  But dig this, sweetie.  Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me..."
irma, Take a bite of peach.
lula," Jesus, honey!  You moren sorta got what you come for...  You better rum me back to the hotel, baby...  You got me hottern Georgia asphalt."
sailor,"Say no more...  But go easy on me, sweetheart...  Tomorrow we got alotta drivin to do.  Hottern Georgia asphalt?"
lula,"Ill drop mama a postcard from somewhere.  I mean, I dont want her to worry no moren necessary."
sailor,"What do you mean by necessary?  Shes probly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut."
lula,"I suppose so.  She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I dont figure she counted on us takin off together like this... I guess this means youre breakin parole, then?"
sailor,You guess?  My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
lula,"Whatll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think?  I hear it dont rain much there."
sailor,You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
lula,We got through two states already.
sailor,That dont smell like a More.
lula,It aint.  Its part of the lessons of life.  I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
sailor,They sure do stink.
lula,"Yeah, I guess, but - and heres the lesson part - they aint supposed to be so bad for you."
sailor,"You aint gonna begin worryin about whats bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar?  I mean, here you are crossin state lines with a A- Number One certified murderer."
lula,"Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Dont exaggerate."
sailor,"Okay, manslaughterer whos broke his parole and got in mind nothin but immoral purposes fars youre concerned."
lula,"Thank the Lord.  Well, you aint let me down yet, Sailor.  Thats moren I can say for the rest of the world?"
sailor,"You please me, too, peanut."
sailor,Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
lula,What kinda trash talk is that?
sailor, What it says on the bumper sticker up front.  On that pickup.
lula,Thats disgustin.  Those kinda sentiments shouldnt be allowed out in public.  Is this Biloxi yet?
sailor,Almost.  I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
lula,Got anyplace special in mind?
sailor,We oughta stay somewhere outta the way.  Not in no Holidays or Ramadas or Motel Six.  If Johnnie Farraguts on our trail hell check those first.
lula,How about that one?  The Host of the Old South Hotel.
sailor,"Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but well try her."
lula,"I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads.  They dont hardly never get washed, and I dont like the idea of lyin on other peoples dirt."
sailor,Come look at this.
lula," Whats that, honey?"
sailor," There aint no water in the swimmin pool.  Just a dead tree fell in, probly from bein struck by lightnin."
lula, Its huge.  This musta been a grand old place at one time.
sailor,"Lets get fed, sweetheart.  The lights fadin fast.  CUT TO:"
santos,"Hello there, Mr. Reindeer... Marcello Santos speaking."
santos,"I gotta problem...  In fact, I gotta coupla problems..."
lula, M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i...  You can almost hear that jazz blowin up from the big N.O.
sailor,Lula...  I learned somethin interestin today on a science show I heard on the radio...  How leeches is comin back into style.
lula,"Say what?  Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes?"
sailor,"Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?"
lula,"Yeah, its a real problem for me, Sailor, you know?  When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi?  I saw em by the register and the girl throw em in.  Im not big on resistin.  So what about a leech?"
sailor,"Heard on the radio how doctors is usin leeches again, just in old times.  You know, when even barbers used em?"
lula," I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off.  Felt awful.  He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it."
sailor,"Yeah, well listen to this...  Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin, theyd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks...  Then put leeches on it."
lula,Sailor?  You expect me to believe a mand be goin around with a arm sewed to his nose?
sailor," How they used to do it.  Course they got more sophisticated ways now. Radio said the Chinese, I think it is, figured a better idea is by insertin a balloon in the forehead and lettin it hand down on the nose."
lula,Sailor Ripley!  You stop!  Youre makin this shit up and I aint gonna sit for it!
sailor,"Honest, Lula.  I probly aint precisely got all the facts straight, but its about what they said."
lula,"Honey, were goin to bed now and its time to change the subject."
sailor,"Were about dry bones, sweetheart. We dont wanna have to push this bird into New Orleans."
lula,"We sure dont, honey...  Get me a Mounds?"
black man," Sorry, gentlemen.  Im most finished on my shoppin here."
erv,This be it?
black man,Yall take American Express?
erv,Yessir.
black man,Then lemme throw in a couple more things.
black man," Pussycats gotta eat, too."
black man," Id just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if its same to you."
erv, We dont have no paper bags.
black man," Thanks for waitin, gentlemen."
sailor," All I wants ten bucks regular. Oh yeah, and a Mounds bar."
sailor,"I aint got my American Express card with me, so I gotta use cash.  Hope thats okay."
lula,That took long enough.  You forget my Mounds?
sailor,"I really do think the country done changed just a little while I was away, peanut."
lula, You got to keep an eye on it.  Thats sure.
reggie,"Do you mind if we share this table? ...  The others, they are occupied."
johnnie, Alright...  By all means.  Make yourselves at home.
drop shadow, Muchas gracias.
reggie,"My name is Reginald San Pedro Sula. But please do call me Reggie.  This is my friend, who we call Drop Shadow.  He is always with me."
johnnie,Johnnie Farragut.  Pleased to meet ya.
reggie,"You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?"
johnnie,"Johnnie, please.  Nope.  Charlotte, North Carolina.  Here on business."
drop shadow,Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
reggie,"Do you know Honduras, Johnny?"
johnnie,Only that its supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
reggie,"Yes, thats so.  But there is not much to destroy."
drop shadow,No big buildings like in New Orleans.
johnnie,Whattaya do there?
reggie," Oh, many things..."
drop shadow,Mr. San Pedro Sulas got an appliance shop.
reggie,But I am also with the government.
johnnie,In what capacity?
reggie,In many capacities.
drop shadow,Mr. San Pedro Sula is with the Secret Service.
johnnie, General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez.
reggie,He is my sponsor.  The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.
drop shadow,Mr. San Pedro Sula is one of his operatives.
reggie,That is my permiso.
drop shadow,Mr. San Pedro Sulas permit to kill.
reggie,"Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country. "
johnnie,Of course.
drop shadow,Mr. San Pedro Sulas authorized to
reggie,"United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase."
johnnie,Why are you in New Orleans?  If you dont mind my askin.
reggie,"Certainly not.  We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA."
drop shadow,He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
reggie,We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
johnnie, Its been a real pleasure.  I wish you both buena suerte wherever you go.
reggie,"The same to you.  If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us.  The Hondurans are great friends of the American people.  But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first?"
johnnie,"I couldnt say, which one?"
drop shadow, Who cares?
lula,"I love it when your eyes get wild, honey.  They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of em.  Oh, Sailor youre so aware of what goes on with me?  I mean, you pay attention.  And I swear, you got the sweetest cock.  Sometimes its like its talkin to me when youre inside?  Like its got a voice all its own.  You get right on me."
sailor,"You really are dangerously cute, honey.  I gotta admit it."
sailor,Lets head out into the crazy world of New Orleans...  I gotta get somethin to eat.
george,My names George Kovich.  Bet youve heard of me.
sailor,Dont know that I have...  Should I know about you for anythin in particular?
george,"Was in all the papers three years ago. Im seventy-six, was only seventy- three then.  Had a business in Buffalo, New York, called Rats With Wings.  Killed pigeons for anyone who wanted em killed."
lula,"Why were you killin pigeons, Mr. Kovich?  Were you in the extermination business?"
george,"No, maam.  I was a housepainter, in the union forty-one years.  Im retired now, livin with my sister, Ida.  Ida moved down here twenty-five years ago, married an oil man named Smoltz, Ed Smoltz.  Hes dead now, so its just me and Ida.  I sold my house and moved down after the city of Buffalo put me out of business. Hell, RWW was doin them a service, and they charged me with endangerin the public."
lula,"Whats wrong with pigeons, Mr. Kovich?"
george,Theyre useless pests.  Ive shot hundreds of em...
george, ...My neighbors hired me to get rid of the pigeons that gathered on their roofs and porches...  CUT TO:
george,"...Neighbors asked me how come the spotted bastards didnt light on my house or my brother Earls anymore, and I told em the truth.  I shot em...  Earls gone now..."
george," ...Heart attack six months ago - had that cholesterol thick as shit... His widow, Mildred, she still lives in the house next to mine."
sailor,"If your neighbors didnt mind, howd you get put out of business?"
george,"Woman drivin down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle.  She called the police and they came over and arrested me.  Thought I was a sniper!  Boys at the VFW loved that one.  Cops didnt understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property.  I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger.  I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebodys cat would eat it.  Hell, I had six cats myself.  So I used the .22 because it didnt make much noise and the ammo was cheap."
sailor,What happened on the charges?
george,Guilty on a reduced charge.  Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place.  You seen it.  Plain filth.
george,"Its a serious situation.  Not like the Turks and the Armenians, maybe, or the Arabs and the Jews, but I want people to remember me and what Ive done and pick up where I left off.  Somebody had to make a move. It was nice meetin you folks."
sailor,"What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?"
lula,"Its just another case, Sailor."
sailor,"Whats that, peanut?"
lula,One person thinks hes doin somethin good and everbody else gets upset about it.
sailor,Aint it the way...
lula,"Sailor?...  Sailor, honey?"
sailor,Huh?
lula,Ever imagine what itd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast?... Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
sailor,"My God,  it better be, darlin, cause itd be the last...  What time is it?"
lula,"Shhhhh...  Its four oclock... That womans laugh the other day had somethin to do with this feelin? ...  Like bein ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe...  Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one."
sailor,"Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts..."
lula,"Anythin interestin in the world come out of somebodys weird thoughts, Sailor.  You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like were seein these days?"
sailor,"You got me, peanut."
lula, You certain?
sailor,"I aint never met anyone come close to you, sugar."
lula,"Recall the time we was sittin one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin against it.  And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, You feel it beatin in there, Lula?...  Get used to it, cause it belongs to you now.  Dyou recall that?"
sailor,I do.
lula,"I was hopin you would.  I know that night by heart.  Sometimes, honey? I think its the best night of my life."
lula, I really do think its the best night of my life.
sailor,"We didnt do nothin special I can remember.  Just talked, is all."
lula,"Talkins good.  Long as you got the other?  Im a big believer in talkin, case you aint noticed."
sailor,Too bad they dont give an award for talkin...  Youd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
lula,"You think so, baby?  Does my talkin bother you, honey?"
sailor,"No, I like gettin up around four a.m. and talkin bout wild animals ...  Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream.  I kinda wish I didnt remember it.  Up at Pee Dee, I couldnt remember any of my dreams."
lula,What was this one?
sailor,"It wasnt no fun, Lula.  The wind was blowin super-hard and I wasnt dressed warm.  Only instead of freezin, I was sweatin strong."
sailor," The water was rollin off me.  And I was dirty, too, like I hadnt had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost."
lula,"Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay."
sailor,"I know.  I kept walkin, I headed for your house, only it wasnt your house, really.  You let me in only you werent real pleased to see me. You kept askin, Whyd you come to see me now?  Why now?  Like itd been a long time since wed seen each ohter."
lula,"Oh, baby, what an idea.  Id always be happy to see you, no matter what."
sailor,"I know, peanut.  But it wasnt all like you were so unhappy I was there, just you were upset.  My bein there was upsettin to you.  You had some kids there, little kids, and I guess youd got married and your husband was comin home any minute."
sailor," I tell you, Lula.  I was shakin wet. All this black sweat was pourin off me, and I knew I was scarin you, so I took off."
lula,"Sometimes dreams just dont mean nothin...  Stuff comes into your mind and you dont have no control over, you know?  Anyways, dreams aint no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half."
sailor,"Well, I aint upset about it, darlin. Just give me an odd feelin there a minute, is all."
lula,Take a bite of Lula.
chet,"Hey!!!...  Johnnie Farragut.  How are you, my man."
johnnie,"Real good, Chet...  Its been awhile."
chet,"Everythins relative.  Wheres that Marietta Pace Fortune?  You two didnt split up, I hope."
johnnie,No...  Shes fine.  Back home.
chet,Whatll it be?  The regular?  Black Label?
johnnie,Set one up.
chet,So who you out sleuthin for now?... Can I help ya?
johnnie,"Actually, Im lookin for Mariettas daughter, Lula.  Her and er beau took off the other day.  Mariettas real upset about it."
chet,"Hell, that rings a bell.  Someone told me somebody lookin like her was at the Nothin Fancy yesterday."
johnnie,Sounds right...  Ill check it out.
chet, You hitched yet?
johnnie,No sir...
chet,"Its none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot?  I always wondered why you never did."
johnnie,"Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that."
chet,Thats what I mean...  Always looked like you was just knocked out in love...  Was real nice to see.
johnnie,"Ill tell ya though, its comin up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down...  I think that times comin up right soon.  But like you said, everythins realtive."
lula,Lets get outta here...  I suddenly got a funny feelin about this place.  Feelin all that voodoo...
sailor, Gotta hex from a voodoo?
lula, Who do?
sailor,You do.
lula,Oh my God...  Its Johnnie...  Duck down!...  Get goin!

sailor,"Lula, darlin...  Makes no difference anyway...  Were outta here."
sailor,"Sweetheart, keep your panties up. Were in Jimmy Swaggart country."
lula,Sure you wanna do this?  Might be a way they could track us.
sailor,"Hes just a regular guyt needs help, honey.  Look at him."
roach,"Thanks a lot.  I been standin out there off and on for two hours, ha-ha! Since noon about, ha-ha!  Cops catch ya hitchin on a Interstate around here they throw ya on a county road crew for a week, less you can pay the ticket, ha-ha!  Which I aint got, ha-ha!"
sailor,"My names Sailor, and this heres Lula.  Whats yours?"
roach,"Marvin DeLoach.  But everbody calls me Roach, ha-ha!  Roach DeLoach, ha-ha!"
lula,You always make that strange little funny laugh when you talk?
roach,"Aint laughin, ha-ha!"
sailor,What you got in the box?
roach,"My dogs, ha-ha!"
roach,"Im headed to Alaska, ha-ha!  These dogs is gonna be my sled team, ha-ha!"
lula, This guys crazy.
sailor,"Where you from, Roach?"
roach,"If you mean where I was born, it was Belzoni, Missippi, ha-ha!  But I been brought up in Baton Rouge."
lula,Why you goin to Alaska?  And whered you get them puppies?  They look sick.
roach,"I saw this movie on TV, ha-ha!  The Call of the Wild.  I aint never seen snow, ha-ha!  I got these dogs at the pound.  Nobody wanted em, ha-ha!  Everbody here got theirself pit bulls or some kinda hounds.  Im gonna feed these boys good so theyll be big and powerful and they can pull me real fast through the snow, ha-ha!"
lula, Sailor!  Stop!  Stop the car now!
lula,"Im sorry, but I cant take this. Roach, or whatever your name is, you come out of there with them dogs this instant!"
lula,"Im truly sorry?  Im truly sorry, Roach.  But aint gonna make it to Alaska?  Least not any part of the way with us.  Youd best find a party to take care of those dogs proper, before they all die?  And, if you dont mind my sayin so?  You could most certainly use some serious lookin after yourself, startin with a bath!"
lula,Drive.
sailor,"You dont feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?"
lula,"I know youre thinkin that I got moren some of my mama in me?  Well, I couldnt help it.  Sailor, I really couldnt.  Im sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin hunk of awful-smellin meat out of his pocket?  I near barfed.  And them poor diseased puppies!"
sailor," Just part of life on the road, peanut."
lula,"Do me a favor, Sailor?  Dont pick up no more hitchers, okay?"
johnnie,"No, Marietta, I havent found em."
marietta,"This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindus lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin dope up her arms."
johnnie,"Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin around in your brain than Carter got pills.  Try to take it easy.  Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days."
marietta,"Im stayin right here by the phone until you find Lula, then Im comin to get her.  You call soons you got somethin, even if its three in the a.m."
johnnie,"I will, Marietta.  Goodbye now."
reggie, Hola!  Senor Farragut!  We meet again.
johnnie,"I thought you two were in Austin, Texas.  Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts."
drop shadow,"We were.  Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning."
reggie,Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
johnnie,Why not?  How was the fishin?
reggie,"I think they are too serious, these American fishermen.  In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method."
johnnie,"So, its back to the islands."
drop shadow,"Yes.  Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting."
reggie,"Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened."
johnnie,This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
reggie, It has its moments of uncertainty.
drop shadow,"But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?"
johnnie,Call me Johnnie...  N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
reggie,"I can tell you are an intelligent man, Johnnie.  One difference between your country and mine is that in the islands, it does not pay to reveal ones intelligence...  Others may use what they perceive against us..."
reggie,Hasta siempre.
johnnie,Hasta siempre.
reggie,Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
johnnie,Hows that?
drop shadow,Two Scotsmen were fighting over a penny.
johnnie,"I gotta admit, you guys are  two in four dozen."
reggie,"The real joke is we never went fishing, but were still fishing."
lula,I wouldnt mind a little night life. How about you?
sailor,"Hard to tell whats shakin in a place like this, honey.  You dont want to be walkin in the wrong door."
lula,Maybe theres a place we could hear some music.  I feel like dancin. We could ask someone.
sailor,Someone up here might know somethin.
buck,Gas?
sailor,"Got enough, thanks.  Were lookin for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin - get somethin to eat, too.  Anything like that around here?"
billy,Cornbreads.  They got western.
buck,"No food, though, cept bar nibbles."
lula,How about speed metal?
lula,"Any kinda rocknroll, honey."
billy,Theres a boogie joint just about a mile straight out Lafitte here.  But thats a black place mostly.
buck,Mostly black though in that boogie place.

bartender zanzibar,"This is a friendly place, son.  You folks just relax and have a nice time."
lula, You got yourself a deal.
bartender," Thats a real jacket...  By that, I mean a real stupid jacket."
sailor,"This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it represents a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom."
bartender,Fuckin honky cracker mumbo jumbo.
lula,Ill be damned if Im leavin.  That band is too good?
sailor,Uh huh.
lula,You notice that woman when we come in?  The white woman sittin by herself?
sailor,Yeah.
lula,"Well, she aint talked to nobody and aint nobody spoke to her that I could tell.  What you make of that?"
sailor,"Honey, we bein strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we dont want to make nothin of nothin."
lula,You think shes pretty?
sailor,"I tend to like em with a little more meat on the bones.  Face aint bad, though."
sailor,"Whats wrong, sweetheart?  Somethin botherin you?"
lula,Mama.  I been thinkin about her. Shes probly worried to death by now.
sailor,Moren likely.
lula,I want to call her and tell her Im okay.  That were okay.
sailor,"I aint so sure its a great idea, but thats up to you.  Just dont tell her where we are."
lula, Pardon me?  Yall got a phone here I can use?
bartender zanzibar,Cant you read?
lula, Back in a bit.
operator,I have a collect call from Lula Fortune.  Will you accept?
marietta,Of course!  Lula?  Where are you? You all right?
lula,"Im fine, mama.  I just wanted to tell you not to worry."
marietta,"Why, how could I not worry?  Not knowin whats happenin to you or where you are?  Are you with that boy?"
lula,"If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am."
marietta,"Are you comin back here soon, Lula? I need you here."
lula,"Need me for what, mama?  Im perfectly fine, and safe, too."
marietta,You in a dance hall or somethin? I can hear music behind you.
lula,Just a place.
marietta,"Really, Lula, this aint right!"
lula,"Right?!  Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us?  How could you do that?"
marietta,"Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans?  Lula, are you in New Orleans?"
lula,"No, mama, Im in Mexico, and were about to get on an airplane to Argentina!"
marietta,"Argentina!  Lula, youre outta your mind.  Now you just tell me where you are and Ill come for you.  I wont say nothin to the police about Sailor, I promise.  He can do what he wants, I dont care."
lula,"Mama, Im hangin up this phone now."
marietta,"No, baby, dont!  Can I send you somethin?  You runnin low on money? Ill wire you some money if you tell me where you are."
lula,"I aint that dumb, mama.  Sailor and I been on a crime spree?  Knockin off convenience stores all across the south?  Aint you read about it?"
marietta,"Lula?  I love you, baby.  I just want you to be all right."
lula,"I am all right, mama.  Thats why I called, to let you know.  I gotta go."
marietta,Call me again soon?  Ill be waitin by the phone.
lula,"Dont be crazy, mama.  Take care of yourself."
sailor,"I was just wastin time, peanut, till you come back."
lula,"Its me whos wastin time, Sailor, bein with you."
sailor,"Honey, Im sorry.  It wasnt nothin. Come on and get up and well take off."
lula,Leave me be for a minute?  Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp.  How you figure Im gonna feel?
sailor,Told you not to call your mama.
marietta,"Santos...  If you get this message, call me right away.  Its Marietta... I dont know, Santos...  Maybe this is all not...  Call me."
marietta,Johnnie!  At last!  I thought you was never gonna come back to your room.
johnnie,"I got some news, Marietta.  Lula and Sailor been here.  They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday."
marietta,"Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me.  She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city."
johnnie,Did she tell you where she was callin from?
marietta,"No, but my guess is theyre headed west, so probly Texas.  Their money must be runnin low.  I dont think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift."
johnnie,Howd she sound?  Was she doin okay?
marietta,"Could she be doin okay, Johnnie? Shes tryin to prove somethin to me, thats all.  Lula aint doin no moren showin off, defyin me...  Johnnie, Ive done somethin bad..."
johnnie,What?
marietta,I wont tell you over the phone. Im comin to N.O. and Ill tell you then.
johnnie,"Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail."
marietta,"No, you wait right there for me... Ill be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven.  Meet me at the airport."
johnnie,"Ill meet you, Marietta, if thats what you want, but Im against it."
marietta,Seven tomorrow evenin.  Se can eat at Galatoires.  Fix it.
lula," How much we got left, honey?"
sailor,Under a hundred.
lula,"You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?"
sailor,Not in Houston.  Wed be better off in some place more out of the way.
lula,You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
sailor,"Thatd be good, Lula."
artie," Come in, Montgomery, Alabama."
artie,"Yes, maam.  Whats on your almost- perfect mind this evening?"
artie,"Im fine, thank you.  I had a cardiac infarction but Im on a new diet and exercising regularly.  Ive never felt better."
artie,Thank you.  Its listeners such as yourself who made me want to get up out of that hospital bed and back into the studio as fast as I could.
lula, Jesus!  How could anyone listen to this crap?
lula, Ill bet.
reporter,"In international news, India plans to release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said."
reporter," The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles."
lula,Damn!

lula,"Course he aint never killed nobody. Whyd you say that, Pace?"
pace,Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin.
lula,And?
pace,Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.

lula,"How can you say that, Sailor?"
sailor,"What makes sense, is all."
lula,"Dont do this, Sailor, please."
sailor," Oiga, amigo.  If ever somethin dont feel right to you, remember what Pancho said to The Cisco Kid... Lets went, before we are dancing at the end of a rope, without music."
