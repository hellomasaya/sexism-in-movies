Speaker,Dialogue
nina, I had the most amazing dream last night. I was dancing the White Swan.
erica,You're in a good mood.
nina,I'm just excited to get back.
erica,Off-season always makes you grumpy.
nina, Look how pink. So pretty. 2A.
erica nina, Pretty. Pretty.
erica,He certainly should. You're the most dedicated dancer in the company.
nina,What?
erica,There.
veronica,Can't believe she's back.
galina,Of course she is.
veronica,She can't take a hint? Company's broke. No one comes to see her anymore.
soloist 1,No one comes to see ballet period.
veronica,"That's not true, I heard the Royal had one of their best seasons yet."
galina,He needs to try something new.
veronica,"No, someone new."
soloist 1,Like who?
veronica,Like someone who's not approaching menopause.
nina,I think it's sad.
veronica,What's sad?
nina,Beth's such an amazing dancer.
galina,So's my grand-mother.
nina,Fonteyn danced into her 50's...
veronica," Yeah, we know."
new girl,Soloists?
ballet mistress,"To the back, fondu, to the back, plie. Fourth, fourth, and one and fifth, to the back...  Like this. Push it. Why can't you do this?"
leroy,"We all know the story: virginal girl, pure and sweet, trapped in the body of a swan. She desires freedom, but only true love can break the spell."
beth,What?!
leroy,"So Nina, would you like to be the Swan Queen?"
nina,If you want me to be.
leroy,"Well, if I was just casting the White Swan, she'd be yours."
new girl,Sorry.
leroy,"Girls, this is Lily. Straight off the plane from San Francisco. She's filling Rebecca's old spot."
lily,I'm good.
nina,Should I go again?
leroy," I've seen enough. Thank you, Nina."
erica,How did it go?
nina,It went okay.
erica,Just okay?
nina,Ow!
nina,I'm fine!
erica,Shhh. Almost done...You're working yourself too hard. We all have off days.
nina,If that girl hadn't barged in.
erica,"I'm sure she didn't mean to. Remember when you started? If I hadn't taken you to each of your classes, you would have been completely lost."
nina,I'm gonna talk to him. Tell him I finished it.
erica,He knows you can do the coda. It won't convince him one way or the other.
nina,"I know, mom. 15A."
erica,Everything will be better in the morning. It always is.
leroy,"Yes, Nina?"
nina,Do you have a minute?
nina,If now's not a good time...
leroy,"Now's fine, what is it?"
nina,"I just wanted to tell you, I practiced the coda last night, and I did it."
leroy,How thrilling for you.
nina, Well...
leroy,"Okay, Nina, listen, I honestly don't care about your technique, you should know that by now."
nina,"Yes, but-"
leroy,"Anyway, I've already chosen Veronica, so..."
nina, I see.
leroy,You're not going to try and change my mind?
nina, I came to ask you to give me the part.
leroy,That all?
nina,I can be the Black Swan too.
leroy,"Really? She's hungry, volatile. In four years, every time you dance, I see you obsess over getting each move exactly right, but I never see you lose yourself."
nina,I want to be perfect.
leroy,Perfection's not just about control. It's also about letting go. Surprising the audience. Surprising yourself. Transcendence.
nina,I- 18A.
leroy,Ow! Fuck!
nina, Sorry.
veronica, What?
nina,Veronica?
nina, What?
veronica,Fuck you.
nina,"Hey...Everything's fine...He picked me, mommy."
nina,Mom?
erica,"My daughter, the Swan Queen."
nina,"Oh, mom."
erica,"It's our favorite, vanilla with strawberry filling."
nina,Just a little piece.
erica,It's a celebration.
nina,My stomach's still in knots.
erica, Fine then.
nina," Mom, don't. I'm sorry."
erica,I'm just so proud of you.
nina,It looks yummy.
nina,Yeah...good luck finding a spot.
david,I am David.
nina,I know you are. I'm Nina.
david,"Yes. Here we go, huh?"
leroy,Okay!
nina,Okay.
leroy,I saw a flash of her yesterday. Get ready to show me more of that bite.
susie,"You share with Beth from now on, so be considerate."
nina,"Thanks, Susie."
susie,Those are for you. From Mr. Leroy.
nina,Beautiful.
leroy,"Ready to be thrown to the wolves? We need their cash, so smile."
leroy,"Dr. Brinson and his lovely wife, Ellen, tonight's sponsors."
nina,Such a beautiful event.
leroy,And this is Mr. and Mrs. Stein.
nina,Just a second.
nina, Nina.
lily,Our New Swan Queen! That is so huge! You must be freaking out.
nina,Yeah...
lily,Stay. Keep me company.
nina,Excuse me.
nina,I think I drank too much. All those toasts...
leroy,You did well.
nina,Really?
leroy,"They tried to eat you alive, but here you are, in one piece."
nina, I guess.
leroy,I'll get you a cab. Where you going?
nina,"Oh, Upper West Side."
leroy,Why don't you come to my place first? It's on the way.
nina,"No, that's good."
leroy, A minute more of ass-kissing. Wait here.
nina, Hello?
beth,What'd you do to get the role?
nina,Some of us don't need to do that.
beth,You fucking little whore.
nina," Beth, I'm-"
beth,I need to talk to you.
leroy,You're drunk. You should go home.
beth,Don't do that! Don't just dismiss me!
leroy," Poor, poor little princess. Try to hold it together."
beth,"I'm going to drop by later, okay? I have something I want to give you."
leroy, Come on.
nina,Thanks.
leroy,I thought it'd be good to talk about the role. Ground us a little.
nina,Yes.
leroy,"The better we get to know each other, the more productive we'll be. I don't want there to be any boundaries between us."
nina,Me neither.
leroy,"Good. So, do you have a boyfriend?"
nina,No...
leroy,Have you had many in the past?
nina,A few. But no one serious.
leroy,"You're not a virgin, are you?"
nina,Excuse me?
leroy,Sex. Do you enjoy it?
nina,Okay.
leroy,So?
nina,Yes?
leroy,Go home and masturbate. Live a little.
erica,Sounds like quite an evening. Wish I could have been there.
nina,You know I asked.
erica,"I know, Susie told me. Guess he wanted you all to himself."
nina,That's not why.
erica,I don't blame him.
nina,They're fake.
erica,Fooled me.
nina,I can do it.
erica,Turn.
nina,It's just a rash.
erica,What are you talking about?
nina,It was worse a couple days ago. It's already getting better.
erica,You've been scratching again.
nina,NO-
erica,I thought you'd outgrown this disgusting habit.
nina,"Mom, please."
erica,"It's the role, isn't it? All this pressure... I was worried it'd be too much."
erica,"Don't be mad at me. You know I love you, you know I want what's best. But we have to take care of you."
nina,What happened?
leroy,"She walked into the street, got hit by a car."
nina,Oh my god...
leroy,I'm sure she did it on purpose.
nina,How do you know?
leroy,Everything Beth ever did came from within. From some dark impulse. It's what could make her so thrilling to watch. Even perfect at times. But also destructive.
nina,Was it right after we saw her?
leroy,It's not your problem. This has nothing to do with you.
older nurse,You can go in.
nina,It's okay.
older nurse,What are you doing?!
leroy,"No, no, not so stiff. Don't be scared of him."
leroy,Forget about control. I want to see passion.
leroy,"David, answer me this question: are you interested in fucking her?"
david,Have fun.
leroy,I'll be the Prince.
leroy,"Use each finger, your face, your tits, everything. Entice me!"
nina,Please don't...
nina,Who's that?
lily,You okay?
nina,I'm fine.
lily,You sure?
nina,We can't smoke in here.
lily,I won't tell if you won't.
nina,Thanks...
lily,"So, want to talk about it?"
nina,Just had a hard day.
lily,Leroy play too rough?
nina,He's brilliant.
lily,"Sure, but not exactly warm and fuzzy."
nina,You don't know him.
lily,Someone's hot for teacher.
nina,I should go. It's getting late.
lily,"Hey, I was only playing."
nina,I'll be out in a second.
leroy,Try it again.
nina,Do you have any corrections?
leroy,No.
nina,I didn't tell her that.
leroy,Maybe you'd like a break for a day or two.
nina,THOMAS-
leroy,Or a fucking month.
nina,She shouldn't have said anything!
leroy,I don't care! You shouldn't be whining to her!
nina,I didn't.
leroy,You could be brilliant. Taking it easy would be a betrayal.
nina,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
leroy,Stop saying that! Stop being so damn weak!
veronica, Look who's gracing us with her presence...
nina,"Lily, I need to talk to you."
lily,Okay...
nina,Now.
veronica, Ooooh.
lily,Shut up.
lily,What's wrong?
nina,You told Thomas about last night?
lily,I ran into him this morning. He said you guys were having some trouble.
nina,Why would he talk to you?
lily,"Whoa your highness, I just told him you're working your ass off and I'm sure you'll be great."
nina,You shouldn't have done that.
lily,I didn't fucking do anything.
erica,Has he tried anything with you?
nina,He's not.
erica,Good. I don't want you making the same mistake I did.
nina, Thanks.
erica,Not like that. I just mean as far as my career was concerned.
nina,What career?
erica,The one I gave up to have you.
erica,So?
nina,And only...
erica,Only what?
nina,Nothing.
erica,What?
nina, Nothing.
erica,How's your skin?
nina,It's fine.
erica,We leaving it alone?
nina,Yes.
erica,Let me see.
erica," I'm sorry, she's not in."
nina,Who was it?
erica,It's no one.
nina,Hello?
lily,Hey.
nina, What are you doing here?
lily,I wanted to apologize.
erica,Sweetheart?
nina,Give me a second.
erica,Your dinner...
nina,"Mom, please!"
lily,She's a trip...
nina,How did you know where I live?
lily,I have my ways.
nina,I don't think-
lily,A drink?
erica,"Sweetie, you need to rest."
lily,Jesus.
nina, Wait.
erica,What are you doing?
nina,I'm going out.
erica,What?
nina, Let's go.
lily,Can't believe that's what he called her. So gross!
nina,I think it's sweet.
lily,Little princess? He probably calls every girl that.
nina,Only Beth.
lily,"Well, I'm sure she lost the title after her game of chicken."
nina,I don't think so.
lily,"Sure, just gotta let him eat the pussy."
waiter," Cheese burger, extra bloody."
lily,Danke schoen.
waiter,Let me know if it's not juicy enough.
lily,"Oh, I will."
waiter,Enjoy.
lily,What?
nina,Guess I'm invisible.
lily,"Here, wanna spruce up?"
nina,I wouldn't know.
lily,"Yeah, right."
nina,I don't want to talk about it.
lily,"Relax, you're so tense."
nina,What is it?
lily,You're kidding? You never rolled?
nina, How long does it last?
lily,Couple hours. Tops.
nina,That's okay.
lily,Sure?
lily,"Heeey, thought we could use some drinks."
nina,I'm gonna go.
lily,This is Tom and this is Jerry.
andrew,Actually it's Andrew.
tom,Tom.
nina,Hi.
lily,"You can't leave, I bought you a drink."
nina,"I really shouldn't, we're on the stage tomorrow."
lily,"What, you gonna go home to mommy? Live a little."
nina,Just a couple of hours?
lily,Tops.
andrew,You haven't told me who you are.
nina,"Oh, I'm a dancer."
andrew,"No, I mean your name."
nina,Nina.
tom,You two sisters? LILY NINA Yes. No.
andrew,Well?
lily,We're blood sisters.
nina,We dance in the same company.
tom," Ahh, ballerinas. So that's why you look alike."
lily,Tom and Jerry are gay lovers.
tom,Very funny.
lily,"Oh, I just assumed."
andrew,I've never been to the ballet.
lily,In that case you're definitely NOT gay.
tom,"It's pretty boring, isn't it?"
nina," No, it's not."
lily, It's not for everyone. You probably aren't sophisticated enough.
tom,"You've got some mouth, you know that?"
lily,Isn't that compliment a little premature?
nina,You guys should come sometime. I can comp you tickets.
tom,Yeah...that'd be neat.
lily,I think we all need another round. Bottom's up.
andrew,So...what are you guys working on these days?
nina,Sorry. Swan Lake.
andrew,Yeah?
nina,You know it?
andrew,"Oh, no, not really. Heard of it though. What's it about?"
nina,It's about a girl who's been turned into a swan. She needs love to break the spell.
andrew,Okay.
nina,"Yeah, but her prince falls for the wrong girl and she kills herself."
andrew,"So a happy ending, then?"
nina,"It's beautiful, actually."
andrew,Like you.
nina,Huh?
andrew,I said you're beautiful.
nina,My hands are all sweaty.
lily,Uh oh! Looks like someone's rolling. Let's get you dancing.
erica,Do you have any idea what time it is?
nina,Mmm-hmm. Late.
erica,Where have you been?
nina,To the moon and back.
erica,You've been drinking.
nina, Ding ding ding.
erica,What else?
nina,Huh?
erica,What else have you been doing?
nina,You want to know their names?
erica,You need to sleep it off.
nina,There were two. Tom and Jerry...
erica,"Be quiet, Nina."
nina, I fucked both of them.
erica,Shut your mouth!
nina,Don't come in here!
erica,What's this?
nina,It's called privacy! I'm not fucking twelve years old anymore!
erica,You're not my Nina right now!
nina,LEAVE ME ALONE!!!
double,Sweet girl.
nina,Why didn't you wake me up?
nina, My music.
leroy,Keep going. Let's finish the Act.
nina,"Thomas, I'm sor-"
lily,Hey...
nina, I overslept.
lily,"Oops... Least you had a good time, right?"
nina,You put something in my drink.
lily, Yeah...
nina,And took off this morning.
lily,This morning?
nina,"Yeah, you slept over."
lily,"Uh, no. Unless your name's Tom and you have a dick."
nina,But we...
lily,"We what, Nina?"
nina,You're lying.
lily," Oh my god, you totally fantasized about me."
nina,Stop.
lily,Was I good?
nina, Shut up!
leroy,The Black Swan has stolen your love. There's only one way to end the pain.
leroy,"At last, I saw the Black Swan."
costumer,"Sit still, I'm almost done."
nina, What's she doing here?
lily,He made me your alternate.  Just in case...
nina,Thomas!
leroy, Go ahead. I'll catch up.
nina,Lily. You made her my alternate.
leroy,"There's always an alternate, you know that. Lily's the best choice."
nina,She wants my role.
leroy,Every dancer in the world wants your role.
nina,"No, she's different. She's after me. She's trying to replace me."
leroy, Nina...
nina,Please believe me.
leroy,"Listen, I know it's been a struggle. But you had a breakthrough this morning."
nina,THOMAS-
leroy,No more. Go home and rest.
nina,What happened?
piano player,"I gotta life, deary."
nina,Hey! Hey! I'm still in here.
beth,What are you doing here?
nina,I'm so sorry.
beth,You stole all these things?
nina,I just wanted to be like you. Perfect.

nina,It's not true.
beth,Fucking nothing!
nina,Beth?!

erica,What are you doing?
nina,GO AWAY!
erica,Open the door!!!
nina,Get OUT!
erica,"Sshh, shhh, it's okay. I'm here."
nina,Where's the clock?
erica,Don't worry.
nina,It's dark. What night is it?
erica,Don't worry. I called the theater and told them you weren't feeling well.
nina,"No, I want to."
erica,Lie down!
nina,Get off me!
erica,We're staying in here until you feel better.
nina,Where is it?
erica,This role is destroying you.
nina,Move.
erica,Nina...
nina,You're crazy!
erica,What happened to my sweet girl?
nina,She's gone.
erica,"Please, you're not well."
nina,Let go! 87A.
erica,You can't handle it!
nina,I can't?! I'm the fucking swan queen! You never even got out of the corps.
erica,You fucking ungrateful-
lily,What are you doing here?
lily,You're supposed to be sick.
leroy,"Lily, give us a minute."
leroy,Are you okay?
nina,I'm fine.
leroy,Nina?
nina,What?
leroy,I already asked Lily-
nina,Fuck. Have you announced it?
leroy,The only person standing in your way is you. It's time to let her go. Lose yourself.
stage manager, Go.
stage manager,What are you doing? You're on!
david,What the fuck?
rothbart,You alright?
stage manager,That's intermission! Act 3 in fifteen.
nina,It wasn't my fault. He dropped me.
leroy, What a fucking disaster!
lily,"Rough start, huh? Pretty humiliating..."
nina,Get out of here.
lily,Wow...rude.
nina,Stop. Just stop.
lily,How about...I dance the Black Swan for you?
nina,Leave me alone. Leave me alone.
double, But it's my turn.
nina,Leave me alone!!!
david,WOW-
stage manager,That's you!
leroy,Get back out there! Get back-
stage manager,Great job. You got fifteen til the last act.
nina,One second.
lily,Hey...you were amazing.
leroy,"Listen to them! They love you! Get up, get up!  I always knew you had it in you, little princess. Go take your bow!"
nina,I felt it.
leroy,Oh my god.
nina,...perfect.
leroy,"Someone, get help."
nina,Shhh...
