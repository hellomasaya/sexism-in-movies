Speaker,Dialogue
helen,"For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!"
calvin,"Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat."
helen,"Well, put it down and come in!"
calvin,"You bet, hon!"
pilot,Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
pilot,Stand by. One.
betty,Just remember: don't mention the communists!
dave,"Calvin's a great guy, but he's a little, you know..."
betty,Nutty.
ruth,What's his wife like?
betty,"Oh, you know, housewife."
dave,Likes to cook. Pregnant.
ruth,"Normal, then."
betty,"Well, I wouldn't go that far.  Helen!"
helen,"Hi, Betty!  Dave!"
betty,Just look at you!
helen,Any day now!
betty,This is my sister and her husband.
helen,"Oh, hi! Welcome!"
calvin,"So anyhow this duck says to the clerk, ""I'd like to buy this lip balm.""  And the clerk says, ""Will that be cash or a check?""  And the duck says, ""Just put it on my bill!"""
dave,He was the golden-boy professor at Cal Tech.  But then he starts inventing things.
bob,What kind of things?
dave,"You got me.  Some kind of special synthetic rubber.  And some kind of automated machine.  Anyhow, suddenly he gets rich.  I mean rich!  And quits teaching."
calvin,How's that?
guest,Just what the doctor ordered!
betty,"With all his money they could have moved to Beverly Hills, but they decided to stay in the Valley.  Calvin spends all his time tinkering out there in his workshop.  If you ask me it's all very strange."
calvin,"There currently exists a type of neon light that lasts five years.  But you won't see it on the market. Same is true of batteries. I could take your simple yacht battery and rig it to last a decade, easily."
harold,"Well, what the heck kind of a marketing system can't get great new products like that out to the public?"
calvin," A veeeery good one, Harold. Free market capitalism may not be a perfect order, but it's the best we've got, or will ever have.  And why?  Three reasons!"
helen," Oh, please don't bring that up!"
calvin,I'd say my baseball card collection is as complete as any one I've ever seen.
ron,"Calvin!  Hey, Calvin!  Kennedy's going toe-to-toe with Khrushchev on the television!"
jfk,"...this sudden, clandestine decision to station strategic weapons for the first time outside of Soviet soil, is a deliberately provocative and unjustified change in the status quo which cannot be accepted by this country."
tower,Wolf One -- say intentions.
pilot,I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
tower,"Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?"
jfk,"...we will not prematurely or unnecessarily risk the cost of worldwide nuclear war, in which even the fruits of victory would be ashes in our mouth.  But neither will we shrink from the risk at any time it must be faced."
calvin,"I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!"
helen,We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
dave, What'd I tell ya?!
calvin,It's time.
helen," Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--"
calvin,"On the contrary, I think we're the only ones who are."
helen,"Well, I'm certainly not going to let the pot roast go to waste. Could you just put that seat cover back on that lawn chair?"
calvin,It shuts off automatically.
helen,Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
calvin,No.  They all do.
helen,I never know anymore.
calvin,"I bet that's a fighter jet on his way to Key West!  Good luck, amigo!"
tower,"An emergency has been declared. I repeat, an emergency has been declared."
calvin,You hear that?!
helen,Yes.
calvin,We can listen to the rest downstairs!
helen,"Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates."
calvin,I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
helen,Cheese is particularly troublesome.
calvin,Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
helen,"Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?"
calvin,"Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio."
pilot,"Tower, say again!!"
tower,The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
pilot,I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
tower,"Roger, Wolf One."
helen,How long will we have to stay down here?
calvin,"I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days."
helen,Days??
calvin,Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
helen,"But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time."
calvin,I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
helen,"Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers."
calvin," Yes, dear!"
helen,As long as we've got that straight.
calvin, Home sweet home!
helen,To you maybe.
helen,What was that?!
calvin,Are you all right?!
helen,"Yes, I think so."
calvin,"Oh, no!  It's happened!  Look at that heat!!  All my surface indicators are knocked out!  Oh, my Lord...it's actually happened!!"
helen,What's that noise?
calvin,The locks.
helen,The locks?
calvin,To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
helen,Thirty -five years!
calvin,Then after that it's safe.
helen,It's safe.
calvin,To go up.
helen,To go up.
calvin," Hey, honey. Don't you worry. We're going to be just fine."
levy,"According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase."
atkinson,"Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit."
levy,"Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess."
atkinson,What about relatives?
levy,All back East.
atkinson,The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
levy,He drank it hot?
atkinson,Yeah.
levy,Good god.
atkinson,Yeah.
calvin,"Hi, honey! Feeling better?"
helen,No.
calvin,"We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child."
helen,All our friends...
calvin,Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
helen,I'm not hungry.
calvin,Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
helen," No, Calvin, you're favorite."
calvin,Really?
calvin,A bit chilly? Shouldn't be. Temperature's a nice 73 degrees.
helen,Maybe I've just got the creeps.
calvin,How could you?! This is just like home!
helen,"No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!"
calvin,Would you like a tranquilizer?
helen,You have tranquilizers?
calvin,I told you! I've got everything!
helen,"Oh, no."
calvin,What?
helen,"Uh, oh. Now it's time."
calvin,Honey?
calvin,Is there a problem?
helen,"No, Calvin.  Babies cry."
calvin,I've noticed.
helen,What shall we call him?
calvin,No.  I think it's just right.
helen,And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
calvin,Yes!
helen,If I...you know...
calvin,"What? Whatever you want, Helen!"
helen,I want a bedroom ceiling.
calvin,You've got it!
calvin,Right here!
helen, We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
calvin,"Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway."
helen,Why?
calvin,"No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!"
helen,"Very nice. Unless it caved in, too."
calvin,Yes.  Well... yes.
helen,Watch this!
calvin,What?
helen,"Go to Daddy, Adam. Go to Daddy."
boss,Damn if I know.
boss,"Well, don't fool with it. If it is a septic tank, I sure as hell don't want to open it. We'll just lay the foundation over it."
realtor,"...and since it's almost certain that the Webbers were killed, the bank is selling the house and that back parcel over there that's been re-zoned commercial. It's right there on the avenue."
woman buyer,Is that where the plane crashed?
realtor,"Yep, right there."
man buyer,This place gives me the willies.
realtor,"Yeah, I know what you mean. But the price is right."
adam,Al ice in won der lan.
calvin,Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
helen,"Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school."
calvin,Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
adam," Look, Daddy. Alice went down a hole, just like us."
calvin,"Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be."
helen,"Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept."
calvin,"I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches."
mom,I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
soda jerk,"You bet, Mom! Coming up!"
calvin, Nothing in the world is more fun than learning new things.
mom,I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
soda jerk, Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
helen,"Boys! Excuse me, but I believe it's my turn.  Adam?"
mom,I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
soda jerk, Um...uh...
mom,What the hell kind of music is that?!
soda jerk,"Oh, man. I'm like not sure I like that."
calvin,"This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an ""investment.""  These are stock ""certificates"" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable."
adam,They're pretty.  Can I have them?
calvin,"Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam."
adam,"Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday."
calvin,"You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!"
adam,Tempus fugit!
calvin,En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul!
adam,Gerade aus dann links!
calvin,Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
adam,Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
calvin," You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me."
calvin,"Hi, honey!"
helen,Hi.
adam,These are wonderful.
calvin,It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
adam,What's baseball?
calvin,"It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher."
adam,Like a painting?
calvin," No, son. A pitcher."
adam,Like one of Mom's?
calvin,"Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat."
adam,The nocturnal flying mammal?
calvin, No. Sit down.
mom,I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
soda jerk,"Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh..."
mom,Buy it from me?
soda jerk,"Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!"
mom,"I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway."
soda jerk,Cool.
helen,Calvin!
helen,Get the presents and do the lights.
calvin,You bet.
adam,"Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!"
calvin,Blow out the candles!
helen,Make a wish!
adam,"Oh, boy! A jacket!"
calvin,Your mom made that all by herself.
adam,No kidding!
helen,No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
calvin,And I made these!
adam,Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
calvin,Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
adam,These are really swell! I mean swell!
helen,"What did you wish for, Adam?"
calvin,"If he tells, it won't come true!"
helen,"Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!"
calvin,"Well, we did in my family!"
adam,I wished I could meet a girl.
helen,"Oh. A nice one, I hope."
adam,"Yes, ma'am."
calvin,One who doesn't glow in the dark.
helen,Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
calvin,"Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful."
adam," Me, too."
helen,Let's eat our cake.
calvin,Yeah. Let's dig in!
helen,"Elbows, Son."
adam,"Sorry, Mom!"
helen,You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
calvin,If we still have one.
helen,Yes...
calvin,"You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?"
helen, Would you excuse me?
calvin,Sure.
calvin,In the generator room again?
helen,"Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work."
calvin,"I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?"
adam,So...we just open this door and go up?
adam,Um...is that supposed to happen?
adam,"Hey, where are we going?!  Is everything all right?!"
calvin,Should we say a little prayer first?
helen,Just open the door.
adam,"Well, do we just go on up?!"
calvin," No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious."
helen," Oh, shit."
calvin,Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
adam,Shit is a French word?
helen,"Yes, yes it is!"
calvin,"It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning...""good""."
helen,Yes! That's right!
adam,Oh.  Well...then...shit!
calvin,"C'est bon, Monsieur."
adam,Merci!
soda jerk,...all of these things...Alcoholics Anonymous...Cocaine Anonymous...Heroin Anonymous.
other bum,There's a Heroin Anonymous?
soda jerk,Shut up! All of these things... ask you to believe in a power greater than yourself! Some sort of God on High! Well...I have lifted my eyes skyward a time or two... and I have certainly not seen anything coming from up there except a goddamn airplane -- that I can't afford to get on!
other bum,Earthquake!  Another earthquake!
soda jerk,"Let her come!  Let's get this over with!  And please, if there is a God, let it be worse in Bel Air!!"
soda jerk,"Oh, God!  Oh, God!!  Oh,God, save me!! For I have seen the light!!"
calvin,I come in peace!!
calvin,"My, gosh..."
calvin,Where is my backyard?
street walker,"You got a light, honey?"
calvin,"What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!"
street walker,Good.
calvin,"So...you...survived the blast, did you?"
street walker,"The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: ""A country boy can survive!"""
calvin,"Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?"
street walker,"""Hell up here?""  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere."
calvin,"Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  ""Boy?""  Did you say you were a ""country boy?"""
street walker,"Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!"
calvin,Really?
street walker,"Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture."
calvin," No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to..."
calvin,"Hello!  How are you this evening?! Mind if I, you know, browse around?!"
calvin,Thank-Q very much!
calvin,"I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants."
helen,Mutants?!
calvin,"It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!"
calvin,Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
helen,No.
calvin,Yes.
helen,I don't believe it!
calvin,"Believe it. He tried to sell me his body, Helen.  They offer lawn furniture as a come on!"
calvin,"They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't."
helen,"Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?"
calvin,We stay down here.
helen,We do?
calvin,Yes.
helen,Excuse me.
helen,For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
calvin,We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
helen," No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!"
calvin,"Well, I am the head of this household--"
helen,I want him to at least see the sky!
calvin,--and we will--
helen,And the ocean!  A mountain range!
calvin,--do as I say!
adam,Dad!
helen,"Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom."
helen,He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
adam,I'll go up.
helen,I'm afraid you've got to.
adam,I'll be all right.
helen, You're my brave boy.
helen,"Just act normal.  If anybody asks, simply say you're from out-of-town, and that you're in town on business. Write that down."
adam,"Yes, ma'am."
helen,"I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing."
adam,"Yes, ma'am."
helen,Let's get you packed.
adam,Right.
helen, I just hope this is still good up there.
adam,Mom?
helen,Yes?
adam,"I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so."
helen,"Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer."
adam,"Yes, ma'am."
helen,"Oh, there's also a thing called a liquor store. Write that down."
helen,"Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything."
adam,"Yes, ma'am."
helen,"Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do."
adam,"Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents."
calvin,Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
adam,"Yes, father?! Yes?"
calvin,...the pipe tobacco.
adam,"Yes, sir.  Is that all?"
calvin,"Also...stay out of the ""Adult Bookstore."""
adam,Adult Bookstore.  Why?
calvin,Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
adam,I promise. Is that all?
calvin,"One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you."
adam,I'll try.
adam,Are you all right?
soda jerk,"Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!"
adam,All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
soda jerk,Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
adam, I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
soda jerk,Yes.
adam,"I've got to go, now."
soda jerk,Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
adam, That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
soda jerk,No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
adam,How do I leave here?
soda jerk,The front door is open.  Will you be back?
adam,I promise.
adam,The sky!!!
adam, Up there!!
adam,Just look!!
woman,What is it!
mother,What?
child,"I see it, mommy!"
woman,What is it?
adam,I have never in my life seen anything like this!!!! Nothing even comes close!!
postal worker,Whatcha looking at?
adam,"Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!"
postal worker, Say what?!
adam," How do you do, ma'am."
postal worker, I do alright.
adam,Good!
pakistani,What is it?!  What do you see?!
adam,"Oh, no!"
pakistani,What?!
adam,"Poisonous gas!!  Run for your life, it's invisible poisonous gas!!!"
calvin,You know--
helen," Thank you, Calvin. Thank you very much."
calvin,He's smart.
helen,"Yes, dear, I know."
adam,Hello! Hi. Good afternoon! Howdy.
adam,I tried to give the driver this but he wouldn't take it. He seems angry. A lot of people do.
psycho, There's a grocery store coming up.
adam,Thank-Q!  Do you think I should get a gun?
psycho,I don't know...maybe.
adam," Driver! Please stop, sir!"
adam,"I'm sorry, what did you call me?"
adam,"Thank you, driver! Good-bye, everyone!"
adam,Is that a birthday cake?!
clerk,"Yes, it is."
adam,Gee-ma-nee!
clerk,Bakersfield.
adam, My first mutants.
adam,Is this because of the radiation?
clerk,What?
adam,Nothing.
butcher,Help you?
adam,"Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties."
butcher,Fresh or frozen?
adam,Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
butcher,"Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box."
adam,"Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!"
butcher,You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
butcher,Sure.
adam,"Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?"
butcher,Gladly.
adam,Driver! Stop this bus immediately! Please sir!!
adam,"Oh my. Oh, my goodness gracious! Oh, my...Oh. That is so great!! Man alive!"
adam,Hello.
jerry, Hi.
adam,"The name is Adam Webber and I see you buy baseball cards and although these are a lot older than the ones in the window, I was hoping you still might be interested."
jerry,"How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?"
adam,I was thinking of selling all the cards.
jerry,Really? No kidding?
adam,"See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that."
jerry,I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
adam,"Oh, that would be wonderful!"
jerry,"Well, we're here to help!"
jerry,"I'm workin' here, Evey-poo.  Don't screw me up."
adam,"Bon soir, mademoiselle!"
eve,Are you French?
adam,No.  I'm here on business.
eve,"Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self."
adam,Get out of here!
eve,"No, you get out of here."
jerry,Terrific...you're fired! You know that?!
eve,"No, ferry--excuse me, Jerry, I quit."
jerry,"Oh, no! I fired ya! Just like the hair salon guy and the Chevy dealer!  You know why you can't keep a goddamn job?!  Because you can't keep your goddamn mouth shut!  That's why!"
adam,Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
jerry," Oh, you got a problem with that?"
adam,I have a big problem with that.  Eve sees a fist fight coming. She takes Adam by the arm.
eve,"Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner."
adam,"Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam."
eve,Just come on.
jerry,"Hah!  Adam and Eve!  The perfect match!  I hope you two will be very happy together!  Mazel-fuckin'-tov! Don't try coming back, Ms. Big Shot! I'm serious this time! You're finished in the hobby business! Take that to the bank, why don'tcha!"
adam,I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
jerry,"Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?"
adam,How 'bout you what?
eve,I said come on!
adam,Where are we going?
eve,"We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college."
adam,"No, I'm lost."
eve,You're lost?
adam,"Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?"
eve,Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
adam,Dickhead?
eve,A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
eve,What's wrong with you?
adam,I just had a mental picture of...
eve,"Here, pick these up!"
adam,I came on a bus.
eve,Why doesn't that surprise me?
adam,I don't know. Why doesn't it?
eve,"Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing."
adam,"Oh, that's nice."
eve,"Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?"
adam, So far?
eve,"Yes, I'm right?"
adam,Right.
eve,"I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?"
adam,Again.
eve,Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
adam,Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
eve,"See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!"
adam,It was amazing.
eve,"Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on."
adam,Do you own a car?
eve,"I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car."
adam,"If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun."
eve,You don't?
adam,Nope.
eve,"Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!"
adam,"I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!"
eve,Get away from me!!
adam,"Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!"
eve,Rogers Hornsby?!?
adam,He's all yours. I was holding him back.
eve,Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
adam,"So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too."
eve,"So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?"
adam,Yes.
eve,And that's it?
adam,Yes.
eve,I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
adam,"Heck, no!  What?!"
eve,Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
eve,"So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?"
adam,It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
eve,Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
adam,Wait!  Wait!
eve,What is it?!
adam,It's Perry!
eve,Perry?
adam,Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
eve,"Okay, okay!  Take it easy!"
eve,How's that?
adam," Oh, I could die..."
eve,Over this?
adam,Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
eve,You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
adam,"Hey, what are you doing?!"
eve,I know a short-cut.
adam,Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
eve,I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
eve,"Card, please.  End of service."
adam,That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
eve,"Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase."
adam,Right.
adam,You know--
adam,Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
clerk,Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
adam,A card?
clerk,"Yes, sir."
adam,Of course!
bellboy,"Bathroom's there, TV's over there. Remote's on top. Room Service menu is on the table."
adam, Of what?
bellboy, The hotel.
adam," I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice."
bellboy,Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
adam,My father is a genius.
bellboy,No kiddin'. Well...good night.
adam,Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
bellboy,How old are you?
adam,Thirty-five.
bellboy,You don't look thirty-five.
adam,How old do I look?
bellboy,Twenty-five? Around there.
adam,I guess living up here makes people look older.
bellboy,Up here on the fifteenth floor?
adam, Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
bellboy,Goodnight.
calvin,"And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen."
helen,Amen.
eve, What in the hell am I doing here?! That's what I'd like to know! Somebody tell me that.
desk clerk,You don't have a last name?
eve,All I know is that his first name is Adam.  No!  Adam Webber!  That's it.
adam, Yes?
eve, Hi. This is the woman from the baseball card store.  Remember me?
adam,Yes!  Hello!  Hi!  Hot-diggity-dog! Thank you for calling me on the telephone!!
eve,"Good grief. Hey listen, I'm in the lobby.  On the first floor! Where the hell else would it be?"
adam,I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!
eve,"Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it."
adam,"I can't, it's yours."
eve,Take it. damn it!
adam, Okay.
eve,Why are you doing that?
adam,I haven't brushed yet.
eve,"Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit."
adam,"Wait, Eve, please!  Wait."
eve,Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
eve,I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
adam,Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
eve,Okay!  Damn!
adam,Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
eve,No.
adam, Thank-Q!
eve,"Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above."
adam,I think it's the eyes.
eve,"The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?"
adam,Watching television in color.
eve,"Hey, no kidding?  In color?"
adam,Cross my heart and hope to die.
eve,"See, ya."
adam,Why doesn't it never work out?
eve,What?
adam,Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
eve,Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
adam,...Okay.
eve,"It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is."
adam,Why not go to work for me?
eve,Doing what?
adam,Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
eve,Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
adam,"Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help."
eve,How long would you need me?
adam,Two weeks.
eve,What's the pay?
adam,What's fair?
eve,I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
adam,You got it! Wait here while I change.
eve,Sure.
eve, My career's finally taking off...
manager,Why would someone need twenty yacht batteries?
eve,I just work for the guy.
manager,And who does he work for?  The CIA?
eve,Naw...it's some sort of charity thing..I guess for starving people with yachts.
eve,Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
adam,They like Dr. Pepper.
eve,Who are these people?
adam,My Mom and Dad.
eve,"Very funny, smart ass."
adam,Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
eve," Swell? Run, Eve.  Run."
adam,Wait! Wait!
eve,What?
eve,"Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!"
adam,Sorry.
eve,Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
adam,"Hey, you know. I was thinking..."
eve,Night!
adam,Night!
adam,We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
eve,"It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy."
adam,I guess we'll need another locker.
eve,No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
adam,"You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you."
eve,Thank you.
adam,"And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh..."
eve,"Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?"
adam,Okay.
eve,"Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat."
adam,There's something else I would like you to help me with.
eve,Name it.
adam,"Well, this is going to sound a little crazy."
eve," Oh, I'm sure it will!"
adam,Then forget it.
eve,"No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?"
adam,This is for me.
eve,Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
adam,Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
eve,A wife?
adam,Yes.
eve,What for?
adam,Because I want to get married.
eve,Why?!
adam,I don't want to be alone.
eve,You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
adam,Bites what?
eve,The big one!
adam,It does?
eve,Sure.
adam,I didn't know that.
eve,Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
adam,They're all divorced?
eve,Everybody's divorced.
adam,It didn't used to be that way.
eve,I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
adam,One who's not a mutant.
eve,"No dogs, huh? Okay."
adam,"And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena."
eve,When do you need her by?
adam,Two weeks.
eve,"Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time."
adam,That's what I was afraid of.
adam,"What do you mean, you can get me laid?"
eve,Could we talk about that a little later?
adam,Of course.
eve, Thank you.
eve,Get out!
adam,The engine is still running.
eve,"Now, get out!!"
adam,"Yes, ma'am!"
eve,Stop that ma'am crap!
adam,Sorry!
eve,You almost got us killed!
adam,I told you I've never driven before!
eve,Never drive again!
adam,You said it would be easy!
eve,I was wrong!!
adam,Is this your house?
eve,Yes!
adam,I like it.
eve,Swell!
cliff,What are you bitching about now?
eve,What are you doing here?
cliff,I forgot some of my stuff.
eve,Your stuff?  Let me see that.
eve,You came back for these?
cliff,"Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?"
eve,"This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff."
adam, How do you do?
cliff,"I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?"
eve,"Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be."
cliff,"Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!"
adam,"Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?"
eve,"He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?"
adam," Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants."
eve, What?!
troy, Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
eve,I knew you'd like him.
troy,"Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse."
adam,You have very nice ceilings.
troy,"I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?"
adam,Not particularly.
troy,"Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or ""nori"" if you prefer. I love sushi."
adam,I love Lucy!
troy,You nut!
eve,Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
adam,Thank-Q!
eve,I thought only hookers drank those things.
adam,"Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!"
troy,Dinner in fifteen minutes. Why don't we sit and chat.
troy,"So, Adam...where on earth are you from?"
eve,Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
adam,It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
troy,And it's called...?
adam,Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
troy,Really?  Since when?
eve, Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
troy,"Oh, yes."
eve,"I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?"
adam,Right on the button.
troy,"Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town."
eve,Give me your hand.
troy," Oh, my God..."
eve,"Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?"
adam,Um-hum.
eve,I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
adam,Yes!
eve,You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
adam,Wow.
troy,That's right?
adam, I've never met anyone like you in my life.
troy,She's right?!
eve,"Hey, butthead, I'm clairvoyant."
adam,I've got goose-bumps all over me.
troy,Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
eve,"Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way."
adam,Good for you.
troy,"Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?"
troy,Who use to own it?
adam,Russia.
troy,When did we get it from them?
adam,"1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course."
troy,What's the capitol?
adam,Juneau.
troy,Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
adam,"Sorry, that's the largest city."
adam,Where's he gone?
eve,He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
adam,He has a computer?
eve,Sure.
adam,In the house?
eve,"No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there."
adam,May I please be excused?
eve,Uh...yeah.
adam,This must be very new.
troy,Yeah.
adam,It's so small.
troy,What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
adam,I don't think so.
troy,You don't have a computer in your cabin?
adam,No.
troy,How do you get through those winters?  What's the highest peak?
adam,Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
troy," Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!"
adam, That would knock my father out.
troy,Yeah?
adam,"Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him."
troy,"He's a Windows guy then, huh?"
adam,Yes. He likes windows.
troy,"Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?"
adam,...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
troy,True.
soda jerk,Who are you?!
helen, I'm the mother.
soda jerk,It's the mother!!
troy,"But first, you have to start with the clothes!"
eve,"Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that."
adam,All right.
eve," So, what are you seeing?"
troy, I don't know.
eve,Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
adam,The what?
eve,"Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?"
troy,"You're serious, aren't you?"
eve,What's that supposed to mean?
troy,It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
eve,"Well, that's blunt!"
troy,I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
eve,"And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?"
troy,"I see ""elegant."""
eve,Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
troy,That's what I'm sensing.
adam,The guy with the underpants!
eve,That's boring!
troy, Not on him.
adam,I'm not wearing his pants.
troy,Why not? He has great pants.
adam,I just don't want to.
troy,Okay.
troy,"Alright, I will."
eve, I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
troy,"What do you think, Adam?"
adam,About clothing?
eve,Yeah.
adam,"Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo."
troy,Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
adam,No.
eve,What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
adam,"It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!"
adam,I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
troy,Almost all of them.
adam,The recovery is very impressive.
troy,"The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months."
adam,Amazing. I'm very impressed.
troy,"Well, what do you think?"
eve,I think...it...works.
troy,Let me show you the entire trousseau!
adam,But first let me show her these!
troy," How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?"
eve, No.
eve,He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
adam,Okay!
eve,That water's freezing!
troy,He's from Alaska.
troy,That's why little things mean so much to him.
adam,I LOVE THIS!!
troy, What?! He wanted to hear some standards!
adam,I get it! I finally get it! You have to see it to understand it!
adam,"Hey, Eve!"
eve,"Have you ever heard the saying, ""He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"""
adam,"Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that."
eve,"Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?"
adam,I certainly do!
eve,"Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?"
adam, No it's not!
eve,Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
adam,Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
eve,"Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--"
adam, Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
eve,Well...yeah. Okay.
adam,"Thank Q, Eve!"
adam,Why did you park way back there?
troy,Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
adam,Oh. I see.
troy,What?!
adam,"Ladies first, Troy! That was close."
adam,My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
eve,Look unimpressed.
troy,Bored even.
troy,Vaguely bored!
eve,"Unimpressed, but still interested."
eve,No!  Not crazy!
adam,Do I look crazy?
eve,Yes!
troy,Be loose.
eve,Just be yourself.
troy,Always good advice.
eve,For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
adam,"Holy Mo-ly, Miss Pay-o-ly!! This place is neat-o!!"
eve,"Jason, Jonathan, this is Adam! Adam, that's them!"
adam,"How do you do?! It's very nice to meet you, Jason and Jonathan!  My mother always told me that if you meet a person for the first time it's easier to remember their names if you use those names right away."
troy,He's from Alaska!
sophie,"Hi, there, Eve, who's the hunk?"
eve,"Get lost, Sophie."
sophie,Hi. I'm Sophie.
adam,"Hello, Sophie, I'm Adam Webber."
jason,Adam lives in Alaska.
sophie,No shit?
adam,Tu parle Francais? Tu a un tres bon accent.
sophie,You speak beautiful French! J'ai habit a Paris un an.
adam,Paris!! La ville de lumieres! C'est bien rencontrer quelqu'un pour pratiquer le francais.
sophie,"Si tu veux, nous pouvons pratiquer beaucoup des choses ensemble."
eve,Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
adam,Good-bye!
sophie,"Non, cherie. A bientot."
adam,I thought I was here to meet women.
eve,Not that one!
adam,I like her.
eve,And don't be so obvious!
eve,What have you ordered?
adam,"It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told."
adam,Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
eve,"Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what ""bitch"" means, don't you?"
adam,"Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you."
eve,"Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!"
adam,How 'bout this one?
eve,Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
troy,Eve?!
eve,"Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal."
troy,"Adam,  I think for you, we should go for ""sweet."""
adam,Okay. I like that.
eve," Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it."
adam, What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
troy,Um... Eve?
eve,It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
adam,Really?
eve,"Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off ""you can't have me"" signals!"
adam,That's ridiculous.
eve,Maybe. But that's how it works.
troy,"Ah-ha! There's "" Miss Sweet.""  At the hors d'oeuvres table!"
eve,"Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me."
adam, And what do I say?
eve,"Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be."
troy,Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
adam,"Okay. Thank you, my friends."
eve,What?
adam,Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
eve,Did you?
troy,I'm not sure I want to watch this.
adam," Surprising and funny. Well, I know a duck who bought some lip balm..."
adam,Hi!
miss sweet, Yes?
adam, I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
miss sweet,"Oh, now, that's a great one!"
adam, You like it?
miss sweet, Bravo!
adam,Thank-Q!
miss sweet,This is my new friend...
adam,I'm Adam Webber.
miss sweet,He's really funny!
heather,Hi!  I'm Heather!
adam,"""Heather?""  I don't believe I've ever heard that name before."
heather,"Yeah, right!"
miss sweet,I told you!  He's funny!
miss sweet,We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
adam,Really?
heather,You dance?
adam,I took a dance lesson everyday of my life until a couple of days ago.
miss sweet,You're kidding!
adam,"No, I'm not! My mom taught me."
miss sweet,Your mom was a dancer?
adam,She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
miss sweet,Sure.
troy,"You know, he's a very, very good--"
eve,Shut up!
troy,Must you...
troy,What in the hell is wrong with you?!!
miss sweet,Is that your girl friend?
adam,No. Would you please excuse me?
heather,If you'll please come back.
adam,I will certainly try.  And thank you both very much for the dance.
miss sweet,When was the last time you saw manners like that?
heather,Yeah.  It's like meeting a foreigner or something.
eve, Go to the bathroom.
troy,"Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!"
adam,You wanted to see me!
eve,"You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!"
adam,Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
eve,Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
adam,"I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied."
eve,You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
adam,No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
eve,I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
adam,All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
adam,"Hello, Cliff, how are you this evening?"
cliff,Not bad.
cliff,But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
adam,"Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--"
cliff, How 'bout a drink at the bar?
eve, Sure.
cliff,It's all yours.
eve,"So where is your roommate, the model?"
cliff,"You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve."
cliff,"Oh, brother..."
adam,"Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?"
cliff,What?!
adam,"I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?"
cliff, Shallow? I'm shallow?!
eve,"Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel."
cliff,Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
adam,"Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself."
cliff,Do ya?
eve,"Stop it, you two!"
cliff, I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
adam," Yes, I agree."
eve,Adam?!
adam,I'm sorry.
cliff, Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
adam, It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
cliff,Eve? I'm leaving.
eve,I don't blame you!
adam," Eve, I'm sorry."
cliff," Well, good night, everyone."
eve,"I'm leaving, too."
adam,"But, Eve, I would--"
eve,And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
eve,He go back to the hotel?
troy,Uh..he might of.
eve,What's that mean?
troy,We did not leave together.
eve,Who did he leave with?
troy,What's it to you?!
eve,"I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?"
troy,"Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me."
eve,Those sluts!
troy,Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
eve,Where are you going?
troy,To bed.
eve,To bed?
troy,Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
eve,What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
eve,"In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days."
troy,"Yes, you do."
eve,And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
troy,"Uh, yes, you do."
eve,Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
troy,"Yes, you do!"
eve,Or have perfect table manners.
troy, Know what else he told me?
eve, What?
troy,He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
eve,"Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is."
troy,"Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses..."
eve,Where did he get all that information?
troy,From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
eve,So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
troy,He didn't leave with them.
eve,Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
troy,He left with Sophie.
eve,What?!!
troy,It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
eve,"Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!"
troy,What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
eve,You're goddamn right I am!
troy, I don't think so.
eve,Coward!
troy,"Gentleman coward, to you."
eve,"Come on!  Come on, damn it!"
adam,Hi!
adam,Eve?!
eve,"Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!"
adam,I'm really sorry!
eve,What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
adam,I know...and I'm really sorry.
eve,"Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!"
adam,What?
eve,Goodnight!
adam,"Eve, if you'll let me, I can --"
eve,Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
adam,I know first aid!
eve,"Well, you had better!!"
eve,Wait a minute.
eve,There.
adam,Thanks.
adam,Steady. Steady.  It's going to be all right in no time.
adam,I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
eve,Is that what you call it?
adam,"But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called ""On the Street Where You Live.""  You know it?"
eve,Sing it to me.
adam," ""All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live.""  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves."
eve,"Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?"
adam,No.
eve,How is that possible?
adam," In 1962, when the bomb was dropped on Los Angeles, my parents were in our fallout shelter.  That's where I was born. We only survived because it was a huge shelter as fallout shelters go. My father worked on it secretly for years. When he had to, he used contractors, but always from out-of- state and always for just a portion of the job. He told them it was a secret government experiment done through CalTech. My Dad's not a liar, but he felt in this case he had no choice. Of course, it had to be a secret, because we had just enough supplies to last three people thirty-five years. That's also why I have no brothers or sisters. The air vent was the really tricky part, but he was able to cut into a flood control sewer. What I'd like to do Eve, is take you down into the fallout shelter with me. We could live there with my Mom and Dad. My dad said if I found a healthy girl I should ""bring her on down"". And you look plenty healthy to me."
eve,Uh-huh. Adam?
adam,"Yes, Eve?"
eve,I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
adam,Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
eve,That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
adam,Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
eve,My pleasure.
adam,It was at least as good as the sky.
eve,Really?  Okay!
adam,And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
eve,Neat. Goodnight!
troy,"Goddamn, Adam!"
adam,Wait a minute!
troy,"I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry."
adam,No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
troy,"Without question, the strangest man I've ever met."
soda jerk,Give us a sign!  That's all we ask! Give us some sort of sign!
adam,"Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!"
troy,How 'bout we check with Eve first?
adam,You bet!
troy,"So, did you buy a movie?"
adam,What?
troy,A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
adam," No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on."
troy, I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
adam,Does that work?
troy,Yeah...Seems to.
adam,"Hi, Eve!"
eve,"Hi, Adam.  This is, uh...."
aron,"I'm Nina Aron, Adam."
adam,How do you do?
aron,"Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life."
adam,Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
aron,"Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown."
adam,Hello.
aron,We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
adam,Come where?
aron,My office.
adam,For how long?
aron,"Well, that depends..."
adam,"I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow."
eve,Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
adam,"...All right, Eve.  If you say so."
eve,...I do.
adam," Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again."
aron,"Let's go talk first, Adam."
adam,"Yes, ma'am."
troy,"Good-bye, Adam."
adam,Goodbye.
aron, You'll be hearing from me.
eve,"Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!"
troy,I know...I know. You did the right thing.
eve,"Oh, no!"
troy,What?!
eve,"Oh, my God!"
aron,He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
eve,No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
aron,I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
eve,"No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--"
aron,"Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious."
eve,"You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone."
aron,And now you must let me be the judge of that!
eve,I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
aron,Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
adam,The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
aron,"Young man, stop right there!"
aron,"Stop, right now! Get out of that truck!"
troy,"Adam, you really shouldn't try to drive that truck!"
adam," Bye, Troy!"
troy,"Bye, Adam!"
adam,And thanks for always being happy!
troy,What?
eve,Gay.
troy,"Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!"
aron,"Hey!!! That's my car, you son of a bitch!!"
brown,I fell down!  What's the license number of that truck?!
aron,Don't ask them!  They're as fucked-up as the other guy!
troy,Let's all just try to remain calm. That's the key thing.
aron,How 'bout I just knock the shit out of you?!
troy,I guess he took what he could.
eve," Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?"
troy,Fallout shelter.
adam,I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
soda jerk,Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
adam,...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
helen,"Are you in trouble, son?!"
adam,I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
helen,A psychiatrist?!
soda jerk,It happens.
helen,My goodness! How bad is it up there?!
soda jerk,Horrible.
calvin,You have something on your forehead.
soda jerk,I know.
troy,This it?
troy,What do you want to do with it?
eve,Give it back to him.
troy,And if we can't find him?
eve,We'll find him.
troy,What's wrong?
eve,I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
troy,See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
jason,"Purchased in 1958 and '59?  Ten thousand shares of each?  They'd be worth millions. Hell, I don't know...millions upon millions upon millions!  How 'bout that?"
troy,"Thanks, Jason."
troy,"Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!"
eve,Have him committed.
troy,Yeah! That's thinking.
eve,"He was always so ""nice""! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! ""Nice"" is weird! Nice is...what is ""nice""? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?"
troy,I don't know. I like to think so.
eve,"Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!"
troy,To get some frozen poultry.
eve,Then what?
troy,We came back to the house!
eve,You didn't stop anywhere else?!
troy,"No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store."
eve,What?!
troy,An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
eve,Come on.
troy,Trendy address.
eve, Have you got a basement?
pakistani," Believe me, all the really good stuff is right here."
eve,Is there a back entrance?
pakistani,Are you kidding?  Of course.
eve,Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
troy,None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
eve,"Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home."
troy,Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
troy,Hi. Troy and Eve are out so leave a message. And if you want to leave a number don't say it fast! I hate that! Say it slow. Thank you.
adam,"Uh, Eve...this is Adam.  Look, I just wanted to thank you for everything you did for me...and I wanted to tell you that I...uh...that I wish so many good things for you. I wish so hard that all of your dreams come true. Um...I, uh..."
eve,Adam!!
troy,Where?!
eve,Stop!
eve,Adam!!
helen,How long will you set it for this time?
calvin,I thought ten years.
helen,"Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and..."
calvin,To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
adam,I'd like for you to meet Miss Eve Rustokov.
eve," How do you do, Mrs. Webber?  Mr. Webber?"
webbers, Hello.
eve,Uh-huh. I've heard so many wonderful things about you.
helen,"Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um..."
calvin,Some time.
helen,"What can I offer you, Eve?"
adam,Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
helen,What?
adam,I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.
calvin,"But, I don't understand."
adam,"And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why."
calvin,"Well, in that case...of course, son."
helen,Of course.
eve,They are wonderful parents.
adam,We have to go.
helen,"No, wait! At least stay for dinner!"
calvin,"Yes, please! You must."
eve,Adam said I shouldn't mention the Communists.
helen,"Oh, yes! Please, don't mention the Communists!"
helen,"Eve. I hope I'm not being nosey, but are you and Adam...um...dating?"
eve,"Yes, Mrs. Webber we are.  I'm also from Pasadena."
calvin,A toast! To Adam and Eve!
eve, What is this sh...stuff?!
calvin,Hot Dr. Pepper! Most people don't know how good it is heated up.
eve,"You know, they don't, do they?"
helen,"Oh, my goodness! We almost forgot!  I like your friend, Adam."
broker,"It's like the Garden of Eden, don't you think?"
adam,That lamp is perfect!
store owner, I'm holding that for Elton John.
troy," Oh, I think not."
adam,"Eve, I've got to go back! My parents can't handle this up here. And there was no bomb, was there?"
eve,No.
adam,"See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?"
eve,"We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!"
adam,My mother's like that.
eve,You'll be a ten percent partner and still retain ownership of the entrance.
soda jerk,Praise the Lord.  And I mean the real one.
adam,You put the tape in here and you get a movie -- in your own home.
helen,This is your bedroom?
adam,"No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office."
helen,"Well, where are you --"
adam,Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
helen,No.
adam,Yes.
eve,Is that all right?
helen,"It's wonderful, dear! Wonderful!!"
calvin, That's wonderful. We Webber guys have mighty good luck when it comes to women.
adam,It's kind of a combination television- typewriter-telephone-post office type of thing.  I'll show it to you later.
calvin,"This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?"
adam,It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
calvin,Uh-huh.
adam,"Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers."
calvin, You're sure?
adam,Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
calvin,That's what everybody believes?
adam,"Yes, sir. It's true."
calvin,"What? Did the politburo just one day say - ""We give up?"""
adam,Yes. That's kind of how it was.
calvin,Uh-huh.
calvin,"My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  ""No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!""  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!"
adam,"Uh, I think they have."
calvin,"Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh...  They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!"
