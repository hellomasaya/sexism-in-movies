Speaker,Dialogue
paul, FUCKING GOD!!!!
jeanne,"A phone token, please."
bartender,"No tokens. At the end, on the left."
jeanne,Thank you.
jeanne,I've come to see the flat. I saw the sign.
concierge,The sign?
jeanne,Yes.
concierge,It's always the same! Nobody ever tells me anything.
jeanne,I'd like to see it.
concierge,You want to rent it?
jeanne,I don't know yet!
concierge,"They rent, they leave and I'm the last to know. Do you think that's right?"
jeanne,Let go of me!
jeanne,Who are you?
paul, Through the door.
jeanne,"Oh yes, I left it open. I didn't hear you come in."
paul,I was already here.
jeanne,Sorry? Oh it was you who took it. I had to bribe the concierge. These old houses are fascinating.
paul,The armchair should go in front of the window.
jeanne,Are you American? You've got an American accent.
paul,I don't know.
jeanne,What are you doing?
jeanne's voice,Hello? Hello --
paul," Hello -- Hello. There's no-one here. There's no-one. I don't know. He puts the SMALL LAMP SHADE back. He hangs the receiver on the back of the chaise. Jeanne continues to listen on her end, UNAWARE."
jeanne,So you're going to take it? You've decided?
paul,I had already decided. But I'm not sure now. Do you like it?
jeanne,I don't know. I shall have to think about it.
paul,Think fast.
jeanne,I thought you'd left.
paul,"Ah... Oh, God."
tom,Watch out!
jeanne,Have they taken us for someone else?
tom,We're in a film.
jeanne,What's going on? Do you know them?
tom,"It's a long story. In short, Portrait of a Girl. It's been accepted for television! And the girl is you. It's you!"
jeanne,You're mad! You might have asked me first.
tom,"Yeah, but I wanted..."
jeanne,"So you kissed me, and you knew it was being filmed. You're a bastard! Traitor!"
tom,"No, you'll see. It will be a love story. Tell me, Jeanne, darling. What did you do while I was away?"
jeanne,"I thought of you day and night, and I cried. Darling, I can't live without you!"
tom,Wonderful! Cut! That was perfect!
catherine,"I'd have finished by now, but the police wouldn't let me touch anything. They didn't believe it was suicide."
paul,Turn the tap off now. CATHERINE They'll be doing the autopsy right now.
paul,Why won't you turn the tap off?
catherine,They told me to give you your razor back.
paul,It's not mine.
catherine,They said they don't need it any more. The investigation is over.
mover,"Excuse me, where shall I put this?"
jeanne,You could have rung the bell.
mover,The door was open. I'll put it there.
jeanne,In front of the fireplace.
mover 2,"Careful, madame."
jeanne,There.
mover,What about the table?
jeanne,How do I know? He'll decide.
jeanne,It won't fit!
mover,"Well, your husband has no idea. All this in an hour... It's not long."
jeanne,What a mess!
mover,Thank you.
mover 2,Thank you.
paul,The armchair goes in front of the window.
jeanne,But I only came to return the key. To return it to you.
paul,I don't care about the key. Take your coat off.
jeanne,OK.
paul,Get those chairs and bring them here.
jeanne,You didn't waste any time...
paul,The bed is too big for the room.
jeanne,I don't know what to call you.
paul,I don't have a name.
jeanne,Do you want to know mine?
paul,"No, no! I don't. I don't want to know your name."
jeanne,You're crazy!
paul,"Maybe I am, but I don't want to know anything about you. I don't wanna know where you live or where you come from. I wanna know nothing, nothing, nothing..."
jeanne,You scare me.
paul,You and I are gonna meet here without knowing anything that goes on outside here.
jeanne,But why?
paul,"Because... Because we don't need names here. Don't you see? We're gonna forget... everything that we knew. Every... All the people,... all that we do,... wherever we live. We're going to forget that, everything, everything."
jeanne,But I can't. Can you?
paul,I don't know. Are you scared?
jeanne,No.
rosa's mother,I thought you'd be here.
paul,I expected you later.
rosa's mother,I took the first train.
paul,What are you looking for?
rosa's mother,"Something that would explain... A letter, a clue."
paul,"Nothing. I told you, there's nothing, nothing at all."
rosa's mother,My little Rosa wouldn't have... Nothing for her mother. Not a word.
paul,It's useless to keep on searching.
rosa's mother,"Not even for you, her husband!"
paul,You need to rest. I think room 12 is free.
guest,Hi.
paul,I don't know. In the evening.
rosa's mother,And then?
paul,"Then I... I already told you on the phone... When I found her, I called the ambulance."
rosa's mother,"After you called, Papa and I stayed up all night, talking about Rosa and you. Papa kept whispering, as if it had happened in our house."
paul,In one of the rooms.
rosa's mother,Did she suffer?
paul,Ask the Doctors. They're doing the autopsy.
rosa's mother,The autopsy.
paul,"The cards, clothes, relatives, flowers. You've got everything in that suitcase. You didn't forget anything. But I don't want any priests here."
rosa's mother,But...
paul,No priests.
rosa's mother,But Paul...
paul,Understand?
rosa's mother,We have to. Funerals must be religious.
paul,No!!!
paul,"The priest doesn't want any suicides. The Church doesn't want any suicides, do they?"
rosa's mother,They'll give her absolution.
paul,Heh!?
rosa's mother,"Absolution and a nice mass. That's all I ask, Paul. Rosa... Rosa is my little girl, do you understand? Rosa... Why did she kill herself?"
paul,Why? Why did she commit suicide? Why?
paul,OOh... Now... Let's... Let's just look at each other.
jeanne,It's beautiful without knowing anything.
paul,Come without touching? OK.
jeanne,No. It's difficult! PAUL I didn't either yet. You're not trying hard enough.
jeanne,I shall have to invent a name for you.
paul,"A name? Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, God, I've been called by a million names all my life. I don't want a name. I'm better off with a grunt or a groan for a name. Do you wanna hear my name?"
jeanne,It's so masculine.
paul,Yeah.
jeanne,Listen to mine.
paul,I didn't get the last name.
tom,You shouldn't have done that to me.
jeanne,"It's not a wig, it's my hair."
tom,"Of course I like it. Listen, you know... I don't know. You have changed, and yet you haven't. I can see the shot now."
jeanne,I'm in a hurry. Let's start.
tom,But... can't we talk a little first?
jeanne,Tonight we improvise. You follow.
olympia's voice,Dogs are worth more than people. Much more.
jeanne,"Meet Olympia, my nanny."
olympia,"Mustapha could always tell the poor from the rich.  If someone well-dressed came in, he never stirred. But if someone scruffy came in, you should have seen him! What a dog! The colonel trained him to recognise Arabs by their scent."
jeanne,"Olympia, open the front door."
olympia,Give me a kiss.
jeanne,"Go and open it.  Olympia is a compendium of domestic virtues. Faithful, admiring, and racist."
jeanne's voice,"After Papa died, we moved back to the family home for a while. My childhood was made up of smells. Musty smells, the smell of walls and rooms."
jeanne,"That's me there. And that's Mademoiselle Sauvage, the teacher. She was very strict... and very religious."
olympia,She was too good. She spoilt you.
jeanne,That's Christine...
olympia,I couldn't live in Paris.
jeanne,We're safe here. It's odd looking at the past.
tom,Cut!
jeanne,What are you doing?
tom,Setting up my shot. There it is! That's it! I've found it. Reverse gear!
jeanne,Papa?
tom,You're soaring. Take off and return to your childhood.
jeanne,In full uniform.
tom,Don't be afraid. Overcome the obstacles.
jeanne,Papa in Algeria.
tom,You're...
jeanne,My favorite route when I was eight.
tom,Beastly.
jeanne,"Here are my cultural sources. Le Grand Larousse.  I just copied from it. Menstruation. Noun. Physiological function comprising the discharge of menses. Penis. Noun. Male copulation organ, measuring five to forty centimeters. That's Le Petit Robert."
tom,Who's that?
jeanne,My first love.
tom,Who?
jeanne,My cousin Paul. My first love.
tom,But his eyes are closed.
jeanne,What?
tom,His eyes are closed! JEANNE He played the piano divinely. That's how I remember him...
jeanne's voice,Sitting at the piano... His fingers would skim the keys.
jeanne,Aren't my trees beautiful? They were my jungle.
kid 1,Having a shit.
kid 2,"No, we're doing a poo."
jeanne,"Shame on you, doing it in my jungle!"
kid 1,Watch out!
kid 2,Run for it!
olympia,"Oh, these dirty little Arabs! Go and shit in your own country!"
tom,"Keep filming. Keep filming! Don't stop, whatever you do!"
jeanne,Did you get it?
tom,Everything.
jeanne,Olympia was great. It'll give a good idea of race relations in the suburbs of Paris.
tom,"It's a real jungle here. So, tell me about your father."
jeanne,I thought we'd finished.
tom,Five minutes.
jeanne,I'm meeting someone for work.
tom,But the colonel... the colonel! But Jeanne is OFF.
jeanne,The colonel had green eyes and shiny boots. I worshipped him. He was so handsome in his uniform.
paul's voice,What a steaming pile of horseshit.
jeanne,What?
paul,"All uniforms are bullshit. Everything outside this place is bullshit. Besides, I don't want to hear about your stories, about your past, and all that."
jeanne,"58, and don't joke about things like that."
paul,"Listen, why don't you stop talking about things that don't matter here? What the hell's the difference?"
jeanne,OK.
paul,Come on the good ship...  Lollipop...
jeanne's voice,Why don't you go back in America?
paul,"I don't know. Bad memories, I guess."
jeanne,Of what?
paul,"Oh... My father was a... a drunk. Tough. Whore-fucker, bar-fighter. Super-masculine. And he was tough. My mother was very... Very poetic. And also a drunk. And... one of my memories, when I was a kid, was of her being arrested nude. We lived in this small town. Farming community. We lived on a farm. And I'd come home after school and she'd be gone. In jail... or something. And... I used to... I used to have to milk a cow every morning and every night and I liked that. I remember..."
jeanne's voice,Not one?
paul,"Yeah. Some. There was a farmer, a very nice guy. Old guy, very poor, and worked real hard. I used to work in a ditch, draining land for farming. And he wore overalls and he smoked a clay pipe. Half the time he wouldn't put tobacco in it. And I hated the work. It was hot and dirty and... it broke my back. And... all day long I'd watch his spit which would run down the pipe stem and hang on the bowl of the pipe. And I used to make bets with myself on when it was going to fall off. And I always lost. I never saw it fall off. I'd just look around and it'd be gone and then the new one would be there. And then we had a beautiful... My mother... My mother taught me to love nature. And... I guess that was the most she could do. And... we had... In front of our house we had this big field... meadow. It was a mustard field in the summer and we had a big black dog named Dutchy. And she used to hunt for rabbits in that field but she couldn't see them. So she'd have to leap up in this mustard field and look around very quickly to see where the rabbits were. And it was... very beautiful. And she never caught the rabbits."
jeanne,You have been had!
paul,Oh really?
jeanne,"I don't wanna know anything about your past, baby!"
paul,You think I was telling you the truth?
jeanne,I'm a Red Riding Hood and you're the wolf.
paul,The better to squeeze a fart out of you!
jeanne,What long nails you have!
paul,The better to scratch your ass with.
jeanne,"Oh, what a lot of fur you have!"
paul,The better to let your crabs hide in.
jeanne,"Ooh, what a long tongue you have!"
paul,"The better to... to stick in your rear, my dear."
jeanne,What's this for?
paul,That's your happiness and my... my ha-penis.
jeanne,Peanuts?
paul,Schlong. Wienerwurst. Cazzo. Bitte. Prick! Joint!
jeanne,It's funny. It's like playing grown- ups when you're little. I feel like a child again here.
paul,Did you have fun as a kid?
jeanne,It's the most beautiful thing.
paul,It's beautiful to be made into a tattletale or forced to admire authority or sell yourself for a piece of candy.
jeanne,I wasn't like that.
paul,No?
jeanne,"I was writing poems. I was drawing castles,... big castles with tower. A lot of tower."
paul,Did you ever think about sex?
jeanne,No. No sex.
paul,"""No. No sex."""
jeanne,Tower.
paul,You were probably in love with your teacher.
jeanne,My teacher was a woman.
paul,And she was a lesbian.
jeanne,How did you know?
paul,That's classical... Anyway...
jeanne,My first love was my cousin Paul.
paul,"No! I'm gonna get a hemorrhoid if you keep telling me names. No names. I don't mind if you tell the truth, but don't give me the names."
jeanne,Sorry. Sorry.
paul,"Well, go on. Tell the truth. What else?"
jeanne,"I was ... He was dark, very thin. I can see him. Big nose! A big romance. I fell in love with him when I heard him playing piano."
paul,You mean when he first got into your knickers.
jeanne,He was a child prodigy. He was playing with both hands.
paul,I'll bet he was... Probably getting his kicks.
jeanne,We were dying of heat.
paul,"Oh, yeah. Good excuse. What else?"
jeanne,"In the afternoon, when the grown- ups were napping..."
paul,You started grabbing his joint.
jeanne,You're crazy!
paul,"Well, he touched you."
jeanne,I never let him! Never!
paul,"Ohhhh. Liar, liar, pants on fire, nose as long as a telephone wire."
jeanne,"No, I'm not."
paul,"Look me straight in the face and say, ""He didn't touch me once."" Huh?"
jeanne,"He touched me, but the way he did it."
paul,"Aha! The way he did it. OK, what did he do?"
jeanne,"Behind the house, there were two trees. A plane tree and a chestnut. I sat under the plane tree and he sat under the chestnut. And one, two, three... We each began to masturbate. The first who came... won!"
paul,When did you first come? How old were you?
jeanne,"The first time? I was really late for school. I started running and it was downhill. All of a sudden, I felt a strong sensation here. So I ran and ran and I came as I ran. The faster I ran, the better it was and the more I came. A couple of days later, I tried to do it again, but no luck."
rosa's mother,I can't sleep with this music.
paul,"I came to this hotel a long time ago, to spend one night. And I stayed for five years."
rosa's mother,"When Papa and I had the hotel, people came here to sleep."
paul,"Now, there's all sorts. They can hide, take drugs, play music."
rosa's mother,"You're not alone, Paul. I'm here."
paul,Do you want me to make them shut up? OK. I'll make them shut up.
rosa's mother,"What are you doing, Paul? I'm afraid!"
paul,"What's the matter, Mother? Are you upset? Don't be. There's nothing to be upset about. It takes so little to make them afraid. I'll tell you what they're afraid of."
rosa's mother,Put the light on!
paul,"You should meet a few clients of the hotel. Hey, folks. I'd like you to say hello to Mom. Mom, this is Mr Juicehead Junky here. And... Mr Saxophone, he's... He's our connection, Mom. He gives us some hard stuff once in a while. And right here is the beautiful Miss Blowjob of 1933. She still makes a few points when she takes her teeth out."
rosa's mother,"The light, Paul."
paul,"Say hello, Mom! This is Mom! Oh! You afraid of the dark, Mom? She's afraid of the dark. Oh, poor thing. All right, sweetheart. I'll take care of you. I'll give you a little light. I'll give you a little light. Don't you worry about a thing."
marcel,"Good evening, madame."
rosa's mother,Good evening.
paul,"Good evening, Marcel."
marcel,"Goodnight, Paul."
rosa's mother,Who's that?
paul,Do you like him? He was Rosa's lover.
jeanne,What am I doing in this apartment with you? Love?
paul,Well... Let's say we're just taking a flying... a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut. JEANNE So you think I'm a wore.
paul,I think you're a what? A what? A wore?
jeanne,A wore.
paul,You mean whore.
jeanne,"Yes, a whore. Whore."
paul,"No, you're just a good old fashioned girl... trying to get along."
jeanne,I prefer to be a whore.
paul,Why were you going through my pockets?
jeanne,To find out OOH you are.
paul,To find out OOH you are.
jeanne,Yes.
paul,"Well, if you look real close, you'll see me hiding behind my zipper."
jeanne,"Well, we know that he buys clothes in some big store. That's not much. But it's a beginning. PAUL That's not a beginning, that's a finish."
jeanne,"Well, OK. Let's forget it. How old are you?"
paul,I'll be 93 this weekend.
jeanne,"Oh, you don't look it."
paul,Thank you.
jeanne,Have you been in college?
paul,Oh yeah. Yeah. I went to... the University of Congo. Studied whale- fucking.
jeanne,Wow!
paul,Are you telling me that I look like a barber?
jeanne,"No, but that's a razor's barber."
paul,That's a barber's razor.
jeanne,"Barber's razors, yes."
paul,Or a madmans. He starts SHAVING his neck with the STRAIGHT RAZOR.
jeanne,So you want to cut me up?
paul,No. That would be like writing my name on your face.
jeanne,Like they do to slaves?
paul,Slaves are branded on the ass and I want you free.
jeanne,Free?! I'm not free! You want to know why...  why you don't want to know anything about me? Because you hate women.
paul,"Oh, really?"
jeanne,What the hell have they ever done to you?
paul,"Well,... either they always pretend to know who I am or they pretend I don't know who they are and that's very boring."
jeanne,I'm not afraid to say who I am. I am 20 years old...
paul,"NO! I... Jesus Christ! Where is your brain? State zitta. Halt's Maul, Schweinehund. Shut up. Get it?"
jeanne,Again! Do it again! Again!
jeanne's voice,I'm coming! I'm ready.
jeanne,Shall we leave together?
jeanne,Tom!
tom,Jeanne! What are you doing there? I'm coming! I'll fly!
jeanne,Wait! I've got to talk to you.
tom,Why didn't you speak on the phone? What's up?
jeanne,You must find someone else.
tom,For what?
jeanne,For your film.
tom,Why.
marcel,Come in!
paul,"You wanted to talk to me. Go on, then. You know I haven't come to cry with you?"
marcel,Do you mind if I carry on working?
paul,Our bathrobes? You can't tell me anything I don't already know.
marcel,"Same colour, same pattern."
paul,"Yes, yes, yes."
marcel,Hobby? I don't like that word. Let's say it's some extra cash. I do it for an agency.
paul,"Oh, so it's serious. It's a job that makes you read? Very educational."
marcel,Be honest. You didn't know we had the same bathrobes.
paul,Marcello...
marcel,We've got a lot of things in common.
paul,"Marcello, I know everything."
marcel,Hold on. Here's the bourbon.
paul,"Was that a present from Rosa, too?"
marcel,"I don't really like bourbon, but Rosa wanted me to keep a bottle here in my room."
paul,Together?
marcel,"It's almost a year that Rosa and I... Not passionately, but regularly... I thought I knew her as much as you can know..."
paul,Your mistress...
marcel,"For example, a while ago, something happened that I still don't understand. Do you see there, on the wall?"
paul,Our room is painted white. Rosa wanted it to be different from the other rooms in the hotel.
marcel,A cold sore. I don't know. Shit.
paul,You're lucky huh? You were... You must have been very handsome 20 years ago.
marcel,Not as much as you.
paul,You've still got all your hair.
marcel,My hair... I have to have it trimmed often. And wash it. I wash it nearly every day.
paul,Don't you have massages?
paul,You're in good shape.
marcel,For that...
paul,Tell me!
marcel,Are you leaving us? I saw your suitcase was packed. Ah... America. Why was she unfaithful to you?
paul,"You can't believe that Rosa... killed herself. It's hard for me to... believe, too."
marcel,This is my secret! Thirty times every morning.
paul," Really, Marcello, I wonder what she ever saw in you. CUT TO:"
jeanne,Are you in?
paul's voice,There's butter in the kitchen.
jeanne,So you're here? Why didn't you answer?
paul,Go get the butter.
jeanne,I have to hurry. I have a cab waiting.
paul,Go get the butter.
paul,Yeah. That's a hiding place.
jeanne,Don't open it!
paul,Why not?
jeanne,I don't know. Don't open it.
paul,What about that? Can I open that?
jeanne,No.
paul,No?
jeanne,"No, but... maybe there is some family secrets inside."
paul,Family secrets?
jeanne,What are you doing?
paul,I'm gonna tell you about the family.
jeanne,No and no! No!
paul,"Repeat it. Say, ""Holy family."" Come on, say it."
jeanne,Church...
paul,Good citizens.
jeanne,Good citizens...
paul,Say it. Say it! The children are tortured until they tell their first lie.
jeanne,The children... are tortured...
paul,Where the will is broken by repression.
jeanne,Where the will... broken... repression.
paul,Where freedom... JEANNE Free... Freedom!
paul,..is assassinated. Freedom is assassinated by egotism. Family...
jeanne,Family...
paul,"You... You... You... You f... You... fucking... fucking... family. You fucking... family! Oh, God... Jesus. Oh, you... Oh..."
paul,Huh?
jeanne,I've got a surprise for you.
paul,What?
jeanne,I've got a surprise for you!
paul,That's good. I like surprises.
jeanne,Music. But I don't know how to work it.
paul,Do you enjoy that?
tom,Do you know why I sent the others away?
jeanne,"Because you're angry, or you want to be alone with me?"
tom,And why do I want to be alone with you?
jeanne,You have something really serious to tell me.
tom,I have something really very serious to tell you.
jeanne,Is it happy or sad?
tom,It's a secret.
jeanne,So it's happy. What sort of secret?
tom,A secret...
sound person,Speak up! I can't hear anything.
tom,...between a man and a woman. JEANNE Is it dirty or is it about love?
tom,About love. But that's not all.
jeanne,"A secret about love, but which isn't love. What is it?!"
tom,Voila. That in a week I'm marrying you.
jeanne,What?
tom,I'm marrying you.
jeanne,What?!
tom,I'm marrying you!
jeanne,You're marrying me?
tom,Yes!
jeanne,We're getting married?
tom,Yes we're getting married.
jeanne,No.
tom,Yes.
jeanne,No!
tom,Yes.
jeanne,Yes? TOM Yes.
jeanne,No.
tom,Yes.
jeanne,Yes?
tom,No. Are we getting married or not?
jeanne,I don't know.
tom,"So, yes, then?"
jeanne,Yes!
tom,No!
jeanne,Yes!
tom,Yes.
jeanne,No.
tom,Yes or no?
jeanne's mother,"Of course, I'll send everything to the country. What do you think, Jeanne?"
jeanne,Olympia will be happy. I went there yesterday with Tom.
jeanne's mother,"Of course, I'm not sending the boots. I'm keeping them with me. I get strange shivers when I touch them."
jeanne,"When I was little, it seemed really heavy when Papa taught me how to shoot."
jeanne's mother,"I'm keeping that here. In a respectable household, it's useful to have a weapon."
jeanne,You don't even know how to use it.
jeanne's mother,The important thing is to have one. It makes an impression.
jeanne,You really kept everything of Papa's.
jeanne's mother,A fine example of a Berber.
jeanne,Oh.
jeanne's mother,"A strong race. I tried to employ them as servants, but it was disastrous. 'm glad I decided to send everything to the country. All his things were piling up and piling up."
jeanne,Don't worry. You'll soon have all the space you want.
jeanne's mother,What does that mean?
jeanne,Nothing.
jeanne's mother,What? What?
jeanne,On this solemn day...
jeanne's mother,What? What solemn day?
jeanne,I'm getting married in a week!
jeanne's mother,What did you say?
jeanne,To Tom! In a week!
jeanne's mother,Pardon?
jeanne,Tom! In a week!
jeanne's mother,What are you doing in a week?
tom,Five... two!
jeanne,Marriage?
tom,Yes.
jeanne,I see it everywhere. All the time.
tom,"What do you mean, everywhere?"
jeanne,On walls. On buildings.
tom,Walls and buildings?
jeanne,"Yes, on advertising hoardings."
tom,What are they selling? Cars. Tinned meat. Cigarettes.
jeanne,"No. They're all about young couples. Before marriage, no children. Then the same couple, married with children. In short, marriage. The perfect, ideal, successful marriage. It's no longer the preserve of the Church. The husband was burdened with responsibilities and the wife nagged. Now, weddings in advertising smile!"
tom,They smile. On posters.
jeanne,"On posters, of course. But why t take poster marriage seriously? Marriage... Pop marriage!"
tom,"Pop? That's the formula. For pop youth, pop marriage! But... what if the pop marriage doesn't work?"
jeanne,Then you have to fix it like you would a car. The spouses are two workers in overalls bending over an engine to fix it.
tom,And in case of adultery what happens to the pop marriage?
jeanne,"In that case, there are three or four workers."
tom,What about love? Is love pop?
jeanne,No. That's not. Love isn't pop.
tom,Love isn't pop. So what is it?
jeanne,"The workers retire to a secret flat, take off their overalls and become men and women again and make love."
tom,You're wonderful.
jeanne,It's the dress that makes the bride.
tom,You're better than Rita Hayworth.
crew 1,You're crazy!
tom,You're all fired!
dresser 1,She must have run off.
tom,When? ln the rain?
jeanne,Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne!
jeanne," I wanted to leave you and I couldn't. I can't. I can't leave you, do you understand?"
paul,Voil!
jeanne,I want to go!
paul,"Wait, wait! Don't you want a bite first? You don't want to run and eat."
jeanne,This is the end!
paul,"No, this is the end..."
jeanne,I wanna go! I can't make love in this bed any more. I can't. It's disgusting! Nauseating!
paul,"Well, we'll fuck on the radiator or standing on the mantel."
paul's voice,Rat's asshole with mayonnaise!
jeanne,I want to get out of here. I want to go. I can't stand it here any more. Yes. I'm going.
front door,"Paul is there, WAITING, NONCHALANT."
paul,"Quo vadis, baby?"
jeanne,I forgot to tell you something. I fell in love with somebody.
paul,"Oh, isn't that wonderful? You know, you're going to have to get out of these wet duds."
jeanne,I'm going to make love with him!
paul,"Well, first you have to take a hot bath. Cos if you don't..."
paul,Give me the soap. She does.
jeanne,I'm in love.
paul,You're in love?
jeanne,"I'm in love! I'm in love, you understand?"
paul,"Fat, is it? How unkind."
jeanne,Half of your hair is out and the other half is almost white.
paul,"In ten years, you'll be playing soccer with your tits."
paul,"Well, maybe. But, you know... I'll be smirking and giggling all the way to eternity."
jeanne,"How poetic. But please, before you go, wash my feet."
paul,OK. oblesse oblige.
jeanne,"You know, he and I, we make love."
paul,"Oh, really? That's wonderful. Is he a good fucker?"
jeanne,Magnificent.
paul,"You know, you're a jerk. Cos the best fucking you're gonna get is right here in this apartment. Stand up."
jeanne,He is full of mysteries.
paul,"Give me the soap. Listen, you dumb dodo. All the mysteries that you're ever gonna know in life are right here."
paul,"You mean, like everybody."
jeanne,"Yeah, but... even he fright me. Even he frightens me."
paul,"What is he, your local pimp?"
jeanne,He could be. He looks it. You know why I'm in love with him?
paul,I can't wait.
jeanne,Because he know. He know how to make me fall in love with him.
paul,You want this man you love to protect and take care of you.
jeanne,Yeah.
paul,"You want this golden, shining, powerful warrior to build a fortress where you can hide in. So you don't have to ever... have... You don't ever have to be afraid. You don't have to feel lonely or empty. That's what you want, isn't it?"
jeanne,Yes.
paul,"Well, you'll never find it."
jeanne,But I find this man. PAUL Then it won't be long until he'll want you to build a fortress for him out of your tits and out of your cunt and your hair and your smile and the way you smell. And... and some place where he can feel comfortable and secure enough so that he can worship in front of the altar of his own prick.
jeanne,But I find this man!
paul,"No, you're alone. You're all alone. You won't be free of that feeling of being alone until you look death right in the face. I mean, that sounds like bullshit, some romantic crap, until you go right up into the ass of death. Right up in his ass... till you find the womb of fear. And then,... maybe... Maybe then, you'll be able to find him."
jeanne,But I find this man. He's you! You are that man!
paul,Get me the scissors.
jeanne,What?
paul,Get me the fingernail scissors.
jeanne,That's it.
paul,I want you to put your fingers up my ass.
jeanne,What?
paul,"Put your fingers up my ass, are you deaf? Go on. I'm gonna get a pig... and I'm... I'm gonna have the pig fuck you.  I want the pig to vomit in your face and I want you to swallow the vomit. Are you gonna do that for me?"
jeanne,Yeah.
paul,Huh?
jeanne,Yeah!
paul,I want the pig to die while... while you're fucking him. Then you'll have to go behind him. I want you to smell the dying farts of the pig. Are you gonna do all of that for me?
jeanne,"Yes, and more than that! And worse! And worse than before."
paul,You look ridiculous in that make- up. Like the caricature of a whore. A little touch of Mommy in the night. Fake Ophelia drowned in the bathtub. I wish you could see yourself. You'd really laugh. You're your mother's masterpiece.
prostitute's voice,Is anyone there?
paul,What?
prostitute's voice,There was a noise in there!
paul,"All right, I'm... I'm coming.  I have to go. I have to go, sweetheart, baby. Somebody's calling me."
prostitute's voice,Well? Is anyone there?
paul,Yeah. I'm coming.
prostitute, Hurry up! Wake up! Open up! Open up!
paul,It's four in the morning.
prostitute,"I need room four for a while.  Yes, that'll do. Yes, half an hour."
paul,We're full.
prostitute,"That's not true. When you're full, you put a sign outside. I know the hotel. I'm sick of arguing out on the street. Call the owner. What are you waiting for? The owner has never made a fuss. Rosa and I are old friends. Open up. Paul opens up."
paul,I'm very sorry.
prostitute,Hurry up! He can't be far away.
john,"Oh,... please don't tell her you found me. I don't fancy it any more. Did you see her face? Once, my wife satisfied me. But now she's got a skin disease. It's like snakeskin. Put yourself in my place."
paul,Come. Come with me.
john,But... Let go of me!
paul,Get the fuck out of here!
jeanne,No!
jeanne,Try and remember! The man from the fourth floor. He moved in a few days ago.
concierge,"I told you, I don't know anyone. They come and go. The man on the fourth, the woman on the first. What do I know?"
jeanne,Where did they take the furniture too? It's empty. Where do you send his mail? Give me his address.
concierge,I don't have it. I don't know these people.
jeanne,Not even his name?
concierge,Nothing!
jeanne,I've found a flat for us. 1 rue Jules Verne. Yes. In Passy. Come quickly! You'll come now? Do you know where it is? I'll wait for you. Come over.
jeanne,"Come in, it's open."
tom,"But I'd like a girl, too. Rosa. As in Rosa Luxemburg. Less famous, but I like it. You know, I wanted to film you every day. In the morning, when you wake up, in the evening, when you sleep. When you first smile, and I didn't film any of that. Here. He hands her FLOWERS. She REGARDS them."
jeanne,I'm here!
tom,It's too big! We'll get lost!
jeanne,Stop it! Don't start!
tom,How did you find this flat?
jeanne,By chance.
tom,We'll change everything!
jeanne,Everything! We'll change chance to destiny.
tom,"Go on, Jeanne. Take off!"
jeanne,What's happening?
tom,"The patches of turbulence are over. We can't play like children any more, Jeanne."
jeanne,Adults? That's awful!
tom,Yes. It's awful.
jeanne,What do adults do?
tom,"I don't know. We'll have to invent the gestures and the words. For example, adults..."
jeanne,Yes...
tom,And... they face up to problems...
jeanne,"...Yes, yes. Yes, yes."
tom,"You see, Jeanne, this flat won't work for us. This flat, it won't work for us, Jeanne."
jeanne,Where are you going?
tom,To look for a flat.
jeanne,What kind of flat?
tom,A flat we can live in.
jeanne,We can live here.
tom,It's squalid. It smells. It makes me sick. Are you coming with me?
jeanne,"No, no. I've got to close the windows and return the key. There's a lot to do."
tom,OK. They meet in the middle of the room again. They share a LOVING HANDSHAKE.
jeanne,Bye.
tom,Bye.
paul,It's me again.
jeanne,It's over. It's over.
paul,"It's over, then it begins again."
jeanne,What begins again? I don't understand anything any more.
paul,There's nothing to understand. We left the apartment. Now we begin again with love and all the rest of it.
jeanne,The rest?
paul,"Yeah, listen."
paul's voice,"But you know, what the hell. I'm... no prize. I picked up a nail when I was in Cuba in and now I got a prostate like an Idaho potato. But I'm still a good stick man, even if I can't have any children. Let's see. I don't have any stomping grounds. I don't have any friends. I suppose if I hadn't met you, I'd probably settle for a hard chair and a hemorrhoid. Anyway, to make a long, dull story even duller, I come from a time when a guy like me would drop into a joint like this and pick up a young chick like you and... and call her a bimbo."
paul,I'm awfully sorry to intrude but I was so struck with your beauty that I thought I could offer you a glass of champagne. Is this seat taken?
jeanne,No.
paul,May I?
jeanne,If you'd like to.
paul,Garcon!
jeanne,"OK, I love you."
paul,Bravo!
jeanne,Tell me about your wife.
paul,Let's talk about us.
jeanne,OK. But this place is so pitiful.
paul,"Yes, but I'm here, aren't I?"
jeanne,Monsieur Maitre d'Htel.
paul,"That's rather nasty. Anyway, you dummy, I love you. And I want to live with you."
jeanne,In your flophouse?
paul,In my flophouse. What the hell does that mean? What the hell difference does it make if I have a flophouse or a hotel or a castle? I love you. What the fuck difference does it make?!
president,"The jury has chosen the following ten best couples: Number 3! 7! 8,9 ...11, 12...13, 14 ... 15 and 19!  And now, ladies and gentlemen, good luck for the last tango!"
jeanne,Give me some more whisky.
paul,"Oh, I thought you weren't drinking."
jeanne,But I'm thirsty now and I want some more drink.
paul,All right. I think that's a good idea.
jeanne,Let's have a toast to our life in the hotel.
paul,"No! Fuck all that! Come on. No. Hey, listen. Let's drink a toast to our life in the country. Huh?"
jeanne,You're a nature lover? You didn't tell me that.
paul,"Oh, for Chr... I'm a nature boy. Can't you see me with the cows and the chicken shit all over me?"
jeanne,"Oh, yeah. To the house of the cows."
paul,Cows.
jeanne,"I will be your cow, too."
paul,And listen... I get to milk you twice a day. How about that?
jeanne,I hate the country.
paul,What do you mean you hate the country?
jeanne,"I hate it! I prefer to go to the hotel. Come on, let's go..."
paul,No. Let's dance. Come on. Don't you wanna dance? We can start again.
president,That's the limit! What are you doing?
paul,Madame! 'Tis ever love.
president,Go to the circus if you want to see love! Go on! Get out of here! You'll have to leave.
paul,"Oh my god, I've never..."
jeanne,It's finished.
paul,What's the matter with you?
jeanne,It's finished!
paul,What's finished?
jeanne,We're never going to see each other again. Never!
paul,That's ridiculous.
jeanne,It's not a joke.
paul,"Oh, you dirty rat!"
jeanne,It's finished.
paul,"Look, when something's finished, it begins again."
jeanne,I'm getting married! I'm going away. It's finished.
paul,"Oh, Jesus. Listen, that's not a subway strap, that's me cock!"
jeanne,It's finished!
paul,Oh... Jesus...
jeanne,Stop! Stop!
paul,Hold it!
jeanne,It's over!
paul,"Hey, cool it!"
jeanne,Stop it! We're finished. He still tries to GRAB HER PURSE. She is ADAMANT.
paul,I can't win. Give me a break!
jeanne,I'll call the police!
paul,Aha! I smell the henhouse.
jeanne,It's over! It's over!
paul,"Oh, fuck the police."
jeanne,It's over!
paul,"Listen, I want to talk to you for Christ sake..."
jeanne,Help!
paul,"Oh, man! She MAKES A DASH FOR her moms apartment."
jeanne,Help! Help me! Help!
paul,This is getting ridiculous.
jeanne,Jeanne...
paul,Our children.
jeanne,I don't know who he is. He followed me in the street. He tried to rape me. He's a lunatic. I don't know what he's called. I don't know his name. I don't know who he is. He tried to rape me. I don't know. I don't know him. I don't know who he is. He's a lunatic. I don't know his name.
