Speaker,Dialogue
4/17/11, BLACK.
robert,"They lived through the Depression, Pearl Harbor, and the Bomb. And they didn't think bad things might happen; they knew they would happen."
maria,Is that what's happening now?
robert,When I was a kid my favorite teacher was Mr. James. Mr. James said that world events always revolve around five things: 
robert,M-O-N-E-Y.
maria, Was this freshman econ?
robert,"This was fifth-grade econ.  But this is something we've seen over and over again, time and time again, that competition for this-- limited amount of dollars out there, can make even the best of us manic. So it's not surprising that we see these asset bubbles, but when reality sets in of course, they burst."
gavin, Here you go...
robert,Quants? Derivatives structures? What was that about?
gavin,It makes no sense.
robert,That's what you said last week. Why'd we go down there?
gavin,To sign.
robert,And did we sign?
gavin,No.
robert,"No. We did not. Instead I fly two thousand miles for a marketing meeting... And where was Mayfield? What was this ""emergency""? What was that about?"
gavin, Did you speak to the auditors?
robert,Why?
gavin,What if... we don't don't close this week...
ellen," Look, your grandfather's here!"
robert,"Hi, guys!"
grandchild,Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?
brooke,"It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs. You're spoiling them rotten."
robert, It's my job! It's my job. You guys turned out fine!
brooke, Debatable.
robert," How you doin', son? Good?"
ellen,We had to eat. The kids were starving...
robert," No, no that's okay. Where's my drink, is this mine, here?"
all,HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!
robert,"Thank you, thank you, thank you all very much, it's such a surprise, I didn't even know it was my birthday!"
peter, ...and to have sold the company to Standard this morning!
robert," That, too, Peter, but- no business tonight-- no business!"
ellen,"Oh, here we go!"
robert,"Although your one-track mind assures me you've got not only your mother's genes, but you've got mine, too!"
all," Hear, hear!"
robert,Kids are wild.
brooke, I don't know about me as a mom.
robert,"No, no no, you should have-- I want more ""you's"" around."
brooke, Four... and nineteen.
robert,"Yeah, yeah yeah..."
brooke,So what was that all about?
robert,What?
brooke,The last time you made a speech like that we lost the Firestone bid.
robert," Yeah, well... I just... wanted it to be about the family tonight."
brooke,You see this?
robert, Yeah... Oy. You know how I feel about that. Trash can.
brooke,Peter's got a copy pinned up in the conference room.
robert," Well, you gonna keep skirting around it?"
brooke,"Why sell our company? We make a great return, we give money to the causes we believe in..."
robert,"My darling, you are still in your 20's. I am 60. That's a big difference in point of view."
brooke,"Dad, you're not that old."
robert, It catches up alright. And maybe there's some other things I'd like to do. Maybe I would like to spend a little more time with you guys... outside the office.
brooke, I'm just trying to imagine what we would do.
ellen,Where are you going?
robert,Office.
ellen,Now?
robert,Yeah I gotta finish up that thing.
ellen," But, I haven't given you your birthday present yet..."
robert, I'll be back as soon as I can.
robert," Yeah, Gavin, it's me, uhh... When you get this -- I want you to call Chris Vogler at Fremaut, tell him I need to see him right away, okay?"
julie, Okay...
robert,"Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late. I'm always late-- you know that-- and I'm sorry. And I'm always saying I'm sorry about being late.  It doesn't mean I wouldn't rather be here with you."
julie, You gonna be there?
robert, I will be there.
julie,I made this for you.
robert,"You made this? This is amazing. One candle, thank you very..."
jeffrey,"Thank you, Diane."
robert,I'm here.
jeffrey,Guess what's not?
robert,"Jeffrey, I told you, I'm..."
jeffrey,"""...working on it,"" yeah. Well, while you're doing that, lemme tell you what's not working..."
robert, Jeffrey...
jeffrey," thirty-two days, while it could be elsewhere invested, earning an actual return, instead of couching the absurd lie that you're spinning."
robert,What do you want me to say?
jeffrey,"That you're gonna get a signature from Mayfield, and that my hostage money and my fee are going to be sent to me promptly, say... by tomorrow?"
robert,I am solving the problem. I am getting you your money and your fee. You will have them very shortly.
jeffrey,When?
robert,As soon as they sign the contract.
jeffrey," You know, I'm not the one with the liability, pal. I just made a loan. You're looking at jail for a thousand years for fraudulent conveyance and..."
robert,...Stop it! You don't have to talk to me like that!...
jeffrey,I didn't get you into this mess!
robert,You were a friend of mine!...
jeffrey,...remember when you asked me if it was a good idea to divert half your liquid assets into a fucking copper mine? What did I tell you?
robert, Are we done here? I think we're done here.
jeffrey, Friday morning I take my money back.
robert, You can't do that...
jeffrey,"...the fuck I can't, it's in an escrow bill with one-day call rights..."
robert,"...I need the money there until they sign, Jeffrey. What if they check again?"
jeffrey,"That's really not my problem, is it?"
robert, Not your fuckin problem...
robert, Let's go.
cnbc announcer,"The DOW continues its uptick this morning on new housing starts to rise 132 points. Asian markets fared less well, especially in Russia, where further nationalization plans caused foreign investment to sputter, leading to various..."
robert, What?
robert, Good. Very good.
robert,Is this too blue?
ellen,It's the third one you've tried.
robert,"Ay, yay yay. I look old."
ellen,"You look regal, and wise, and granted a little worried. What is going on? Are you afraid of this meeting?"
robert,They haven't signed the papers.
ellen,I thought that's why you flew down there.
robert," So did I, but for some reason they're stalling. I didn't get any sleep on the plane and..."
ellen,Now come on. It will all work out. Just follow the plan.
robert,What plan is that?
ellen,"""Confidence equals contract."""
robert, You sound like a fortune cookie.
ellen,"They're your words, actually."
robert,Then you married an idiot.
ellen," Okay, but I was thinking, idiot, that, after the deal is done, which it definitely will be, why don't we just take off? Pete's in the best place he's ever been, your daughter is always as brilliant, right? So, I wanna have some fun. I wanna have fun with you!"
robert, There hasn't been time.
ellen,We have to make time. We go for a year. Let's take a year and get fat and have fun and go on an adventure. I mean-- seriously-- how much money do we need?. Do you wanna be the richest guy in the cemetery?
robert,I don't wanna be in the cemetery!
ellen,"Oh, by the way, Mary called from St. Victor's Hospital, again, she said they still haven't gotten the check yet..."
robert,I'm taking care of it.
ellen,The gala is Friday. Should I be selling my ring? What's going on?
robert,I've had to move some things around for the merger.
ellen,It's only two million.
robert, Only two million?
ellen, Yeah!
robert,You remember-- Riccio's? Full meals... two bucks... all you can eat... three bucks...
ellen,I do remember. But I do not remember you being so sentimental unless you were trying to change the subject.
robert, I don't know what you're talking about...
robert, Where the hell is Mayfield?
barnes," Mr. Miller, thank you for coming. We were just getting acquainted with Brooke and Peter here."
robert, I hope they didn't beat you up too much.
aimes,They've been terrific.
peter,"Dad, we've been talking about operations. Tim thinks once we consolidate we can save about fifty percent on our back-office."
robert,"I'd love to hear about that, but...  I had thought Mr. Mayfield planned to join us tonight."
aimes, Jim should be here in twenty minutes; he suggested we get right into details.
barnes,"I was just telling Brooke: now that we can market your quants' track records, we have access to a host of new capital that..."
barnes,"...assuming we shed debt through some small liquidations, I'd say..."
robert,"I'm sorry, gentlemen, we've been here nearly two hours now. Where is Mr. Mayfield?"
aimes,"He just texted me. He's very sorry, but he's been detained."
robert,Detained where?
barnes,"Of course. Again, Mr. Miller, a privilege."
robert,"Yeah, yeah yeah."
brooke, Dad...
gavin, This is the bullshit way you try to close a deal?
aimes,Port? Would you like to have some port?
brooke,Did you get my message?
robert,No. What's up?
brooke,We need to sit down.
robert,What is it?
brooke,I don't want to talk about it here.
robert, BROOKE--
brooke,"I found some strange entries in the ""Old Hill"" books."
robert,What kind of entries?
brooke,"I'm not sure yet, but there's definitely something off."
robert,"Alright, come by about eleven tomorrow and we'll look at it then. And Brooke?"
brooke,Yeah.
robert,See if you can find out what happened to Mayfield.
robert,How're they doing?
assistant,Great. Everyone loves them.
robert,"Yeah, but how are they doing?"
assistant,So-so.
robert,Where's Julie?
assistant,She's in the back.
robert,"Hey, Julie."
julie,"Oh...  This is Robert Miller, one of our collectors. This Katrina Stanton, and Alex Stanton and their daughter Ava, who is a talented young artist."
robert,"Oh, really? Painter?"
ava,Drawings.
robert," I like the size of the paintings, I wanna talk to you about them in a second."
julie,Go -- away.
robert,I will take  those two. And the Rubik's cube on the back wall.
assistant," Right there, number seven."
robert,Don't tell her it was me.  I mean it.
assistant,You got it.
painter,"...fucking Dalwood wouldn't know a Van Gogh from a Van Eyck. And they call it a ""State of Contemporism..."""
julie, Who's this?
julie,What do you want?
julie,Where?
robert,I'm in your bedroom. Can you get those people out of here?
julie,Are you serious?
robert,Look down the hall. Do you see me?
julie, I see you.
robert,"Okay, so I'm serious."
julie,You just come in and out whenever you want?
robert,I thought we should talk...
julie," One damn night in a month I told you was important to me, et tu es meme pas capable d'etre la..."
robert,"...I was working, do you understand? I'm under enormous pressure, I have obligations..."
julie,...I don't want to hear about your obligations. If you cared -- YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE!
robert,"I was there! I was there! I was late, but I was there. And I'm here now."
julie,"No, no, no. You're here when it's convenient for you to be here. C'est pas ca l'amour. Love means YOU FUCKING SHOW UP!"
robert,I'm sorry.
julie,Why did you buy those paintings?
robert,Because I liked them.
julie,"Okay, thank you for helping me get started. But if I'm gonna fail-- then let me fail!"
robert,"Julie, you're not gonna fail. Why would you fail?"
julie,What image?
robert,Success.
julie, You're never gonna leave her.
robert,Come away with me. Let's just take your car and go...
julie,...Where?...
robert,"There's a place upstate. Very beautiful, on the water. We can wake up there together- just you and me. I'd like that."
julie,"Me, too."
robert," Yes, I wanna make it collect..."
operator,"Your name, sir?"
robert,Lawrence Grant.
robert,"Jimmy, it's me."
robert,I want you to listen to me very closely...
bryer,You gotta be fucking kidding me.
mills,Catching detective wants us to rule before he calls it.
bryer,We've been having the same fuckin' argument for twenty years.  They can't handle one drunk motorist kills herself?
mills,I'm not so sure about this...
bryer,... So who kicked out the door?
robert,Let's go.
jimmy,You gonna tell me what this is?
robert,It's better you don't ask.
jimmy,"So all you're sayin' is, you need a ride somewhere."
robert,That's correct.
jimmy,Because I want to be very clear about this: you called me to give you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.
robert,"No, you're not. We're not here."
jimmy,"Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?"
robert,"We're both alseep right now. At home. Which is where you left your phone, right?"
jimmy,Right.
robert,Because if anyone checks...
jimmy,Why is anyone gonna check?
robert,"They're not, as long as we're not here. Anybody know you're here?"
jimmy,No.
robert,Somebody knows you're here?
jimmy,No!
robert,But somebody knows-- you're not there.
jimmy,"Well, my girl..."
robert,"Oh, Jesus, Jimmy..."
jimmy,"Man, you call up two am, what the fuck you want? She asked me where I was going."
robert,What'd you say?
jimmy,I told her I had to run out a minute.
robert,Do you trust her?
jimmy,Is this the kinda shit you used to do to my dad?
robert,Do you trust her?
jimmy,"Yes, I fucking trust her!"
robert,"Good. So you're at home, and I'm at home. My wife gets up at five am for Pilates -- I will be there next to her, where I've been all night. And you'll do the same with yours."
jimmy,This is some pretty fucked up shit.
robert,Jimmy...
jimmy,"No, man, come on, I don't hear from you since the fuckin' funeral, you call me up out of the blue, using my father's name, ask me..."
robert,"...what do you want, you want money? I will give you five thousand dollars! I will give you ten thousand dollars! I'll give you whatever you fuckin'..."
jimmy,You wanna talk to me like that you can get the fuck outta my car and you can walk! You want that?! You wanna fuckin' walk home?!
robert, Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not myself. I need your help.
jimmy,You alright?
robert,"No, I just... have to get home... I'll deal with it in a couple of hours."
jimmy,What if you don't make it a couple of hours?
robert,Then I don't make it.
jimmy," Call me, alright, and let me know it's okay."
robert, Better we don't talk for a while.
jimmy, So what you get in a bind and just call up the only nigger you know?
robert,"I'm sorry, Jimmy. I really am. Just go home."
jimmy,"Yeah, alright, man. Take care of that."
servant,"Everything okay, sir?"
robert,"I'm fine, Glen. Go back to bed."
ellen, Where did you go?
robert,What?
ellen," I woke up for a minute, you weren't here..."
robert,I just went to... eat some ice cream.
ellen,Was it good?
robert, Yes...
ellen,Good. Don't forget to take your Lipitor in the morning...
robert,Ellen...
ellen,What?
robert,Do you still love me?
ellen,Of course I do...
syd,"Hypothetically, the situation you're describing would be involuntary manslaughter."
robert,And such a person...
syd,"...would be in a lot of trouble, especially if that person was closing a merger with a large public bank where any publicity or arrest could delay or derail the transaction.  But that's only if there was some evidence that could link him to the crime."
robert,"Fingerprints, DNA?"
syd,Very hard to collect after an explosion. The real world's different from television.
robert,What about cell phone records?
syd,Did this person make any calls from the area?
robert,"Not from a cell phone, no."
syd,Then they won't be able to place him there.
robert,What would you advise such a person to do?
syd,To confess immediately.
robert,Failing which?
syd,"To put as much distance between himself and the event as possible, if possible. But let me tell you something, and I'm speaking to you as a friend now: there are about fifty things that person wouldn't have thought of. And the more time that passes, the more lies that are told, the worse it gets for him."
robert,Yeah.
syd,They're going to come to you.
robert,I know.
syd,An accident's not the worst trouble. If we talk to them now we can probably work it out.
robert,"You tell me what happens if the Standard deal does not close, and I gotta tell my investors about our real losses?"
syd,Nothing good.
robert,And what'd you say about the Justice Department? Depending on what they decide to arrest me on-- fraud conviction gets me twenty years?
syd,I did.
robert, What choice do I really have?
chris,You're aware Congress plans to extend the audit requirements for private funds.
robert,Of course I am aware. I gave testimony to the committee.  You know this.
chris,"Well, Standard wants to prepare for it now. So I was asked to go through every one of your trading books and reconfirm their assets."
robert,No. Absolutely not. That's impossible.
chris,"Don't worry. I put the team on different books and I left ""Old Hill"" for myself.  Anyway, I'm here to tell you-- I cleared it."
robert,The audit's cleared?
chris,"The report will be issued today. Actually, I'm calling it my ""swan song."""
robert,You're leaving?
chris,"Yeah, on Friday, it's a five-year clock."
robert, And why?
chris,"Uhh.. To prevent exactly what we're doing. But honestly, there's nothing left to worry about. It's -- great."
robert, Get out.
robert,What?
robert,What the fuck are you talking about?
robert,"Oh... Oh, it was fine..."
robert,He's here? Where?
robert,He called?
robert,You think we're dealing with a fucking idiot?
robert,That's being issued now.
robert,"Never mind that, just find out why Mayfield hasn't called us."
robert,Do I have to do every Goddamn thing myself? JUST FIND OUT! WILL YOU PLEASE...? THANK YOU!
brooke,I cannot reconcile it...
robert,Reconcile what?
brooke,"The ""Old Hill"" Fund. Dad, are you listening to me?"
robert,"Of course I'm listening.  Okay, those trades are in the special book. They don't get audited on the same balance sheet."
brooke,"Yeah, but look at the sheet! It can't be right. There's a four hundred million dollar hole here. I mean that can't be right."
receptionist,May I help you?
bryer,Detective Bryer. I was hoping to see Mr. Miller.
cindy,Is he expecting you?
bryer,Possibly.
brooke,"...the way that this sheet reads, half of the fund's assets are missing."
robert, That's ridiculous. That can't be right.
brooke,"I know, it's ridiculous, and yet..."
robert,"Okay, I'll look into it. I promise you I'll look into it."
robert," Give me two minutes, then send him in..."
brooke,Everything alright?
robert,"Yes, my other meeting just got here early. We'll have to pick this up later."
brooke,Okay. And Mom wants to know about the hospital check?
robert,"Brooke, we'll pick it up later, alright?"
brooke,Okay.
robert,"Yeah, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. You can sit there. We just heard about it. Really terrible."
bryer,"Okay, so you were an investor in her gallery?"
robert,Correct.
bryer,How'd you meet her?
robert,Through... I think it was a charity function. My wife and I have a foundation.
bryer,Uh-huh. When'd you last see her?
robert,"Last night, at the gallery."
bryer,Did you stay till the doors closed?
robert,"No, I think I left about ten."
bryer,Where'd you go?
robert,Home.
bryer,You go straight home?
robert,Yeah.
bryer,You stay home?
robert,Yeah.
bryer, Your wife home?
robert, Yes.
bryer,"Okay. Okay, so now, back to the gallery. Did you see her with anyone?"
robert,See her with anyone-- what do you mean?
bryer,"You know like a boyfriend, someone she might've left with?"
robert,"Not that I noticed. No. No, no."
bryer,"Reason I ask, is, that we haven't located the driver."
robert,The driver?
bryer,"Yeah, someone else was driving.  Sometimes, the driver, will go for help-- and he'll die tryin', you know..."
robert,This is awful. This is truly awful.
bryer,We're searching the area right now. So no boyfriend that you know of?
robert,Actually we didn't talk about personal matters.
bryer,"She was just an employee, right?"
robert,Well not an employee. I was an investor.
bryer,Why'd you invest?
robert,Why did I invest?
bryer,"Yeah, why'd you invest?"
robert,"She had a great eye. She found me  those Bryce Marden's there. They went up in value very quickly, and on the basis of that I agreed to fund some of the gallery."
bryer, Would you mind if we searched her apartment?
robert,Why would I mind?
bryer,It's in your company's name.
robert,"Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure, go ahead."
bryer,"Now, Mr. Miller..."
robert,Mmm-hmm?
bryer,Why would you lease an apartment for Ms. Cte? Is that something you normally do for your employees?
robert,"Actually I said that she wasn't an employee, but-- I think she'd just come over from Paris if I remember, and she needed a place to entertain buyers."
bryer,So you leased her this apartment.
robert,It was through our holding company. You seem a little confused by all this...
bryer, I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.
robert,Alright.
bryer,"Now, I don't mean to be indelicate..."
robert,But you're going to be indelicate...
bryer,"Well, from what I've been able to gather, she wasn't exactly an art star. I mean, she worked for a couple a dealers in Paris, but..."
robert,"Oh, okay, I get it, so why would I invest in her and help her find a place?"
bryer,"Something like that, yeah."
robert,"It's very simple, detective. I invest in people I believe in. I thought she'd do well, so I backed her, she did. It's is simple as that."
bryer," So we're all good with the apartment, then?"
robert,Sure.
bryer,Thanks.
robert,What?
bryer,That's a nasty cut; I've been looking at that for the last five minutes. Does it hurt you?
robert," Oh, no, I just hit it on the medicine cabinet."
bryer,Last night?
robert,This morning.
bryer,Hate when that happens.
robert,"Yeah. Me, too."
bryer,"Well, thanks for the chat."
robert,No problem.
mae, Ellen Miller's office...
ellen," And it, it transformed them, seriously."
mae, There's a Detective Bryer in the lobby.
ellen," I'm sorry, what?"
mae,Detective Bryer.
ellen,What does he want?
mae,I don't know.
ellen," Well, I'm late so-- I just can't deal with it right now."
mae,"Okay, what about these?"
ellen,"Send them a thank you note, Zappos has been so generous-- Thanks, bye guys."
bryer, Mrs. Miller?
ellen, Yes?
bryer, Detective Bryer.
ellen,Did you just call my office?
bryer,"Yeah, I was hoping to talk to you."
ellen,"Well, I don't have time right now, sorry.."
bryer, Just take a couple a seconds. It's about your husband.
ellen,"Well, fine, but, make an appointment."
mills,How'd it go?
bryer,"Well, the wife blew me off-- which was interesting. And he didn't admit to the affair, but then he wouldn't, would he?"
mills,Why didn't you pick him up?
bryer,He's a very rich man. What happened with the pay phones?
mills,Got about fifteen calls in a three- mile. Two of `em look a little strange: got an incoming-- that's probably a local drug deal...
bryer,And the one we care about?
mills,Collect call. About a minute and a half. Made from the Chevron station on West Lake Road.
bryer,Who'd he call?
mills,Cellphone in Harlem. Still waiting on the address.
bryer, You call someone in Harlem?
gavin," Robert, I just heard about Julie... I'm so sorry. Her Gallery called. Her mom's flying in today."
robert, Her Mom...? Service here?
gavin,Tomorrow at nine am.
robert,"Well we should pick up the expenses for that. Whatever she wants. You'll take care of that personally, for me?"
gavin, Of course... Are you okay?
robert,You reach Mayfield?
gavin,"Not yet, but we'll get him...  Robert, I..."
robert,Thanks. Appreciate your concern.
mills,Let's flash him.
mills,Mr. Grant?
jimmy,Yes?
mills,"NYPD Homicide, would you mind stepping into the car?"
jimmy,What's this about?
bryer," Just get in the car, Jimmy."
jimmy,Am I under arrest?
bryer, You wanna be?
bryer,So let's do this again.
jimmy,"Man, for what? My answers ain't gonna change."
bryer,You were asleep.
jimmy,Right.
bryer,And your phone rings.
jimmy,Right.
bryer,And it's a wrong number.
jimmy,I don't think I wanna answer any more questions.
bryer,"And you stay on the phone a minute and a half on a wrong number? What the fuck do you talk about, area codes?"
jimmy,I want to talk to my lawyer.
mills,"Listen, kid, we know you went out there. We ID'd your photo with your neighbor who saw you getting into your truck ten minutes after this call was made."
jimmy,"Well if you got all that, what the fuck you need me for, officer?"
bryer,"I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation here, Jimmy. This is a homicide."
jimmy,Lawyer.
robert,You're gonna sign him out?
syd,I called in Earl Monroe.
robert,The basketball player?
syd,Civil rights attorney. You remember Crown Heights?
robert,He's the best?
syd,He's the best above 96th Street- and that doesn't make him any cheaper.
robert,You've gotta get Jimmy out of this.
syd,It might not be that easy. If he doesn't cooperate they're likely to indict him on obstruction.
robert,What would he be looking at?
syd,"Hard to say. With his prior... Five years, maybe ten."
bryer, This is not going to go away.
earl,I'll call you tomorrow if there's any news. Don't worry about anything. And don't talk to anyone else. You take care.
robert,"Come on, get in."
jimmy,All you said was you wanted a fucking ride! You didn't tell me you killed that girl!
robert,Jimmy...
jimmy,"I'm trying to put my life back together. Okay, I appreciate you helped us, but now you're pushing it too far."
robert,It's gonna be okay.
jimmy,Like it was your ass sitting in there? Like you know a fucking thing about how it's gonna be?
robert,We've got you the best criminal lawyer--
jimmy,--Don't you got your own son for this? Why the hell you didn't call him?
robert,"Cause he woulda fucked it up, okay?"
jimmy,"Well I'm sorry your son's a fuckin' idiot, but that ain't my fault."
syd,This isn't productive.
jimmy,"Oh, okay. So tell us then, Syd, what happens now?"
syd,We meet with Earl and we go from there. I understand that right now they don't have enough to charge you with anything.
robert,Your under suspicion.
jimmy,"Under suspicion? Motherfucker, I'm Black!"
robert,I am aware of that.
jimmy,And what exactly would you like me to do about it?
syd," Gentlemen, my driver will take you where you wanna go, but I cannot be a party to this conversation, so this is where I get out..."
jimmy,Why couldn't you have just stayed?
robert,I couldn't.
jimmy,Why not?
robert,"Because I have responsibilities. And if I stayed there, a lot of people would've been hurt."
jimmy,Somebody was hurt.
robert,"Other people, Jimmy. I've got business troubles, you understand...? People rely on me."
jimmy,Yeah.
robert,"Yeah, I know I messed up, alright? I'm sorry. But I do want to help you, you know that.  So I've been able to set up a situation for you."
jimmy,What's that?
robert,"It's a trust. In your name, assets of $2 Million dollars. Take a look at that."
jimmy, Are you serious? You think money's gonna fix this?
robert,What else is there?
jimmy," Yo, yo man, pull over."
robert, What are you gonna do?
jimmy,I look like a fucking snitch to you?
robert,"I don't know, Jimmy. I don't know. Are you?"
robert,"Yeah, put him through...  Chris..."
robert, What...?
robert,Chris...
robert,"Chris? CHRIS! Goddamnit, Chris!"
brooke," Peter...? I'm looking at some statements right now... How much did you book last quarter?... No, I'm not... No, Peter, I'm really just asking you..."
ben,What are you doing in my office?
brooke, Can you explain these?
ben,Explain what?
brooke,Old Hill. All the numbers you've falsified.
ben, You don't know what you're saying.
brooke,Get out of my way.
ben,Brooke...
brooke,You're hurting my arm.
ben,Can't you just leave it alone?
brooke,"You're fired, Ben."
ben,You can't fire me.
brooke,I just did.
ben,Who do you think asked me to make those changes?
brooke,83 You tell me. 83
mills,"He was doing a little dealing a while back, but it looks like he stopped."
flores,Any family?
bryer,"Nah, they're all dead."
flores," Then his mom dies and he gets popped for gun possession. Even so, how come he got probation?"
bryer,"Well, he had an excellent lawyer."
flores, How the fuck does this kid afford Felder and Chausse...?
bryer,We pulled his parents' tax returns. Guess where his father worked for twenty years?
flores," Wow, this guy's good..."
mills,So far he won't budge.
flores,"Well he's a convicted felon. Go get a warrant, put him in front of a grand jury. Let's see how long he holds out when he realizes he's looking at ten years off the prior."
secretary,"I'm sorry, Mr. Miller, as I explained from downstairs, he's on a call right now, and he said..."
chris,What the fuck...?
robert,Tell me what is going on.
chris,I can't.
robert,Tell me what's going on!
chris,I can't!
robert,Why not?!
chris,It's not me!
robert,What do you mean it's not...?
chris,THE AUDIT PASSED!
robert, The audit passed? What do you mean the audit passed?
chris,"It passed! It passed a week ago! Like I said. Everything's fine! We confirmed the money, it's all straight and done."
robert, Then... why did you tell me that it didn't?
chris,Because they asked me to hold it.
robert,They? Who's they?  Who is they?!
chris,Mayfield.
robert, Mayfield?
chris,What?
robert,They're negotiating. He wants a better price.
robert, Mr. Mayfield... I think it's time we had a talk.
deferlito,...cause it's not gonna hold.
bryer,The warrant doesn't need to hold. It just needs to scare him into giving up Miller.
deferlito,"What is it, Mike, you're stalled- out mid-career so you're reaching for a high-note? Who gives a fuck?"
bryer,"This is about Judge Rittenband, isn't it? It's cause he's running again?"
deferlito,You wanna cost the Judge his seat on a profiling claim? Against Earl Monroe?
bryer, I'm getting a piece of new evidence that'll seal it a hundred percent.
deferlito,"Good, then come back when you got it."
bryer,"I'll have it before you go in the jury room... Look, Ray. We like this kid. I don't wanna lose him. Think about it: if we flip him, you get Robert Miller. What's that worth to Rittenband, and to you for that matter...?  Twenty years, Ray. Twenty fucking years, we watch these guys- they out-lawyer us, they out-buy us. I'm fucking sick of it. Where's the consequence? The guy did it. He does not get to walk just cause he's on CNBC."
deferlito,You better not fuck me.
bryer, Yeah... I need a serious fuckin' favor...
cindy,Brooke's waiting for you...
robert,Did we have a meeting?
cindy,"No, but she looked upset."
robert," Sweetie, you okay? What's wrong?"
robert,You wanna sit?
brooke,I'll stand.  Didn't you think I'd find out?
robert,I did.
brooke,Then why didn't you tell me?
robert,Because I hoped you wouldn't.
brooke,"Oh, come on. You tell me the truth now -- or I am done."
robert,I made a bad bet.
brooke,"No, you committed fraud."
robert,"That's a dangerous word, Brooke."
brooke,What would you prefer? That you cheated? That you stole money from people who trusted you? That you lied? That you lied right to my face? Why?
robert,Because we were going broke! Everything was finished. We'd have nothing.
brooke,How. How does that happen?
robert,"You remember Alexanderov? Well he came to see me one day last year. He said ""Robert, we've got a great opportunity- there's a copper mine, it's in Russia, it's under- exploited- there's billions under the ground, and to get it out, all we need is a couple hundred million, you put in a hundred, we'll put in a hundred- we'll triple it all in six months."" So, I go check it out. And the geological survey's right, friendly government. And to lock it in, you hedge it, right? Sell the copper ahead on the commodities exchange and it all works, it's fine, and you're making a fortune.  But then there's something I hadn't accounted for-- variation margin-- and that friendly Russian government all of a sudden not so friendly anymore and they're blocking the export of the copper so I gotta make it up, I gotta put the cash in to cover the hedge. But I'm not worried about it because it's still springing money, there's so much money coming out of the ground you can't believe. You can't stop it. And, yes, I'm the oracle, I've done housing, I've arb'd credit swaps, I have done it all, and yes, again, I know it's outside the charter, but it is FUCKING MINTING MONEY! IT'S A LICENSE TO PRINT MONEY! FOR EVERYBODY! FOREVER! IT IS GOD!..."
brooke,Until...
robert,Until it's not... The money's trapped. You can't get it out. Probably never will.  It's like a plane crash. It just happens.
brooke,Well it does not just happen.
robert,"Not just happen, honey you are so naive sometimes. It HAPPENS. And like every father I pray that it doesn't HAPPEN to you, which, thanks to me, it probably won't happen to you..."
brooke,"Thanks to you, we may all be arrested."
robert,"Nobody's getting arrested. That's why I borrowed the money from Jeffrey. Plug the hole, I put it there for a month, they see the books are fine, I transfer the company, I pay back Jeffrey-- with interest!-- make all of our investors whole, and what's left we keep. At least we get to keep the house."
brooke,Everybody wins?
robert,Yes.
brooke,If the company sells. If I lie for you.
robert,You don't have to lie. You didn't know about it.
brooke," I'm the Chief Investment Officer of this company. What do you think they'll say at the depositions? ""She didn't know?"" They'll take away my brokerage license- failure to supervise you -- my name in every paper and blog while I visit your ass in jail!"
robert,What did you want me to do? Did you want me to let our investors go bankrupt? Is that what you wanted? For people to get really hurt?
brooke,What... gives you the audacity to think you can make those decisions?
robert, Because it's my job!
brooke,"No, it's illegal. It's illegal. And I am your partner."
robert,You are not my partner! You work for me!  Everybody works for me!
brooke, For a moment I thought you were gonna say you were sorry.
robert, I'm sorry.
jimmy," Oh, man, what?"
bryer,"Jimmy, take a ride with me."
jimmy,Where? Back to the station?
bryer,"No man, just get in the car."
jimmy,What if I say no?
bryer,I'm not threatening you. I'm just asking you -- take a ride with me.
jimmy,"Alright, man, what?"
bryer,"Look, it's pretty fuckin' simple. I know you went to pick him up."
jimmy,This is what you wanna talk about? I told you I ain't makin' no more statements.
bryer,And I know why.
jimmy,Somebody cares?
bryer,Take a look at this.  And then I've got you. I've got the time log from the pay phone. I've a got a fucking tollbooth photograph of you driving your car through the Triborough.
jimmy,"Where you got that...? That's bullshit, cause I didn't do it. That's impossible."
bryer,Really?
jimmy,"Talk to Earl, Detective."
bryer,"Fuck Earl! You see this?  This means that tomorrow, grand jury hears your case in court. And tomorrow in court I'm gonna ask for a felony obstruction indictment, and with with your prior, you are going to prison for fifteen fucking years... You might get out in ten. You'll be what then? Thirty-three, with no job, no girl, no life."
jimmy,Who's Miller?
bryer,I know about your father.
jimmy, You don't know a Goddamn thing about my father.
bryer,I know Miller paid his bills while he was dying. I know he got Syd Felder to get you out of trouble on your gun charge. That doesn't add up to this.
jimmy,You done?
bryer,"Okay, he's driving, he crashes- he runs away- who does he call? Calls you. Why do you think that is?  `Cause you're disposable- you're the one person he could call that just doesn't fuckin' matter. You're a- you're a throwaway. You're just another part of his transaction."
jimmy, Will you open the door?
bryer,"So what, what? You're his new nigger now?"
jimmy,Open-- OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!
bryer,You didn't kill that girl. He did.
jimmy, Will you -- open -- the door?
bryer,He's using you. I know it - you know it. Do the right thing. Now get outta my fuckin' car.
syd,He's gonna walk.
robert,You're certain?
syd,"Courts aren't for certainty, but he says he was at home, why shouldn't he be? A phone call doesn't make him a liar.  But what's baffling to me, though, despite your sentimental history together, is why you would put your family's future in this kid's hands."
robert, He's not like us.
syd,Is that a good thing?
robert, I don't know.
syd,How's Ellen?
robert,She's good. Fine.  Why?
syd,I heard something...
robert,Yes...?
syd,She met with Gil Deuchman.
robert,The estate lawyer?
syd,Yeah. Has she mentioned anything?
robert,Not to me.
deferlito,That was the early morning of April 11th.
jimmy,Yes.
deferlito,You received a phone call?
jimmy,Yes.
deferlito,Who called you?
jimmy,It was a wrong number.
deferlito,"That's a lie, isn't it, Mr. Grant?"
jimmy,No.
deferlito,"You stayed on the phone one-and-a- half minutes... Mr. Grant, isn't it the case that you know exactly who called you and exactly why? Why are you lying to this court?"
jimmy,I'm not lying.
deferlito,"I'm going to introduce into evidence People's A. This is a toll booth photograph taken in the northbound ninth lane of the Triborough bridge. Mr. Grant, directing your attention to the photograph, would you please read the date and time stamp indicated on the lower right hand corner?"
jimmy,This is crazy.
earl, You're gonna have to answer that.
deferlito,"Mr. Grant, please answer the question."
jimmy,"April 11th, two thirty-three am."
deferlito,"Mr. Grant, directing your attention to the same photograph, would you please read the license plate number of the vehicle passing through the toll?"
jimmy,D D G five five four two.
deferlito," This is People's B, a printout from the Department of Motor Vehicles plate registry... Mr. Grant, directing your attention to that printout, are those numbers on the toll photograph the same ones that are on your own license plate?"
jimmy,Yes.
deferlito,"Yes, the numbers are the same?"
jimmy,Yes.
deferlito,How do you explain that?
jimmy,I can't.
deferlito,"But that is your car in this photograph, isn't it?"
jimmy,No.
deferlito,"No, that is not your car?  Answer the question, Mr. Grant."
jimmy,"This is not my car in this picture. I don't know how you all did that, but this is not my car."
deferlito,You expect this grand jury to believe that that is not your car when there is a printout from the department of motor vehicles...
earl,"That's asked and answered, Mr. Deferlito."
deferlito,"Mr. Monroe, you are aware that you're not permitted to go on record."
earl,Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that?
jimmy,They're lying!
earl,"Okay, now here's what..."
bryer,I can halt the decision.
earl,"We need a minute, Detective."
bryer,"What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?"
jimmy,You can get the fuck outta my face. How `bout that?.
bryer,So you wanna keep playing games? Or you ready to tell me something?
earl,"Detective, I need to talk to my client. Now if you would just please..."
jimmy,How you- How you all just gonna lie like that? Huh? How you all just gonna lie?!
bryer,We didn't lie. You lied.
jimmy,That wasn't my car.
earl,"...Jimmy, don't say anything else."
bryer,Sure it wasn't. And it was a telemarketer called you from the pay phone? He stopped at the Chevron to make a late night sale?
jimmy,That picture was some bullshit...
earl,"...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's going on?"
bryer,"Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy. Tell him. See how the boss'll like this one."
earl, Wait here.
assistant,"Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce you to Julie's mom, Sandrine."
robert,"I am so, so sorry."
sandrine, I just wanted to thank you for what you did for my daughter.
robert, No...
sandrine,"You believed in her, and you gave her a chance. She was happy. I know she was happy."
robert,"It's just...  not fair, is it?"
ellen,...she's rail thin. She's a blond. I would not have known who she was if she hadn't come up and introduced herself to me. She looked totally different... and...  You're going straight to level six don't you think you better pace yourself a little bit?
brooke, I'm good. I wanna run.
ellen,Everything okay with you and Tom?
brooke,We're fine.
ellen,Are you worried about the deal closing?
brooke, No.
ellen,"You want me to guess?  Brookie, come on, don't be silly, tell me what's..."
brooke," You know, I can't stay for breakfast I have to just... I have to get in to work, I don't know what I was thinking."
ellen," Did you uh, finish the deal with the hospital?"
brooke,No.
ellen,Did he write the check?
brooke,No.
ellen,Why not?
brooke,Issues related to the closing.
ellen,"We don't lie to each other, Brooke."
brooke,I'm not lying to you. It's complicated; you wouldn't understand.
ellen," Uh, I know that a policeman showed up at the office? Do you know what that's about?"
brooke,I honestly have no idea.
ellen,"What about your father's head- where he cut his head and the pain that he's hiding in his stomach and, now  For some reason that's way to complicated for me to understand, there's no money for a routine gift? Does that seem a little strange to you?"
brooke,Of course it's strange.
ellen,So tell me what's happening.
brooke, What do you want me to say? He's my dad. I have to trust him.
ellen,"No. You have to do what's right for you. Not him, not me, not anyone. This is your life."
brooke, I gotta go.
ellen, Fuck.
robert,"You keep sending people to my office to ""do business."""
mayfield,They're just getting acquainted.
robert,"With the intricacies of my operation so that you can... not buy it?  Just coffee, please."
mayfield,"You remember what it was like on our side of the fence. Everything just moves... a little slower. Plus this whole audit mess doesn't help. You know, clearing that all up..."
robert,Fuck you.
mayfield,Excuse me...?
robert,FUCK - YOU. I'm the Oracle of Gracie Square. You came to me. I did not come to you.
mayfield,"Robert, I think we're getting off on the wrong foot..."
robert,"No, no, no. Forget it, forget it... Forget the deal. I don't even care about the deal. No, I run a comfortable -- excuse me -- I run a THRIVING business, that has returned year-to-date 15.4% percent to our investors, or approximately $583 Million dollars from a trading operation that you don't have and that we both know that you need, or else you never would've called me in the first place. You on the other hand, you've taken a salary of  And what have you delivered? A falling stock price of negative 14 dollars? Is that what it is? You've also lost approximately... THREE AND A HALF BILLION FOR YOUR INVESTORS- TELL ME -- WHY - THE FUCK - DO I - NEED YOU?"
mayfield,Let's just calm down...
robert,"...so we issue a press release today, say there is no deal, never was a deal. You're not gonna be buying Old Hill, you're not gonna be buying Quantum- you're not gonna be buying anything; You? You're just a browser. Now, me? I'll continue to enjoy my earnings, and while I SOAR on princely wings, to my next winning enterprise, your stock drops another couple bucks on yet another - failed - acquisition - attempt. Bodes well for your tenure, doesn't it?"
mayfield,Your price is too high.
robert,"You have a nice day, James."
mayfield, Four hundred.
robert,Five-fifty.
mayfield,Four-fifty.
robert,"Five twenty-five. That's it. Yes or no?  And if it's no, send any further communication right to my trash can."
mayfield, It's a deal.
robert," One other thing -- six months and I'm gonna be gone. I'm outta here. My daughter's gonna take it over. You know her, you trust her."
mayfield,Alright.
robert,And you're gonna have to make my son a VP.
mayfield, Robert...
robert,"No, no. He doesn't have to do anything, he just gets the salary, he gets the office. Both of `em on five-year employment contracts, and my lawyers draft them. Yes or no?"
mayfield,Yes.
robert,I'm writing the deal.
mayfield,Are you serious?
robert, I'm serious. I'm very serious. Sign it.
mayfield,I'll send over a draft of the press release.
robert,I'm fine... Before I go -- how much would you have paid...?
mayfield,Six hundred. And you would've taken...?
robert,Four seventy-five.
mayfield,So we made a good deal.
robert, Yeah.
robert,"...Anyway I will be seeing most of you at the gala tomorrow night. But as the sale's official as of this afternoon, you are now free to talk about it. Any questions?"
peter, Will we get new business cards?
robert," Alright, it's a great day. Your hard work made it happen"
gavin, So how'd you make Mayfield come around?
robert,I met his price. I just took it out of your share.
gavin,Robert?
robert,Yeah.
gavin,Good work.
robert,"Well, thank you. Now go get me that fucking hospital check."
jimmy,You want something to drink?
robert,What you got?
jimmy,Not much.
robert,You got any milk?
jimmy,No.
robert,I'll take a water.
jimmy,What?
robert,The boxes.
jimmy,"I was planning on Virginia, but it looks like I'm not going anymore."
robert,I told you not to take the toll.
jimmy,"Yes, you did."
robert,"I said ""Listen to what I have to tell you and follow my directions, listen to me closely, do the following just like I say."""
jimmy,Yes. You said all that.
robert,But you took the toll anyway.
jimmy,"No, I did not."
robert,"Come on, Jimmy, don't fucking lie to me..."
jimmy,I'm not lying! I took ninety-five all the Goddamn way there. I did what you said: I didn't stop. I didn't take the Triborough. I followed all your fucking instructions.
robert,So where'd they get the photograph from?
jimmy,You tell me.
robert,"So, you're saying... it's a fake?"
jimmy,How'd you get so fuckin' rich again?
robert,Don't be such a wiseass...
jimmy,"Hey, this is my fuckin' life, man! Earl's telling me it could be ten years? Ten fucking years! How much are ten years worth, Robert? "
robert, What plan?
jimmy,I got money saved up; I'm buying a business.
robert,What business?
jimmy,I bought an Applebee's.
robert,What's an Applebee's?
jimmy,"It's a fucking restaurant, man, it's a chain restaurant."
robert,You bought an Applebee's in Virginia?
jimmy,Is this really what you came here to talk about? What are you gonna do?
robert," It's not really that simple, Jimmy. I'm in a situation now."
jimmy,What situation?
robert,"I told you... right now, if I were to speak, a lot of people would get hurt. Jobs, families. A lot of innocent people. Do you think you can understand that?"
jimmy,"Yeah but what about me? What about my situation?  They showed me pictures, man; that's fucked up what you did."
robert, It was an accident.
jimmy,"And yeah, I know, all the people counting on you, whatever, but -- you told me Earl was gonna make this right. Now you know I care about you, all the things you did for us, and for my father, but Earl said they're offering me a deal, no charges at all. I walk away. They just want to know who I went to pick up.  Why are you putting me in this position, man? Why are you putting me in this situation?"
robert, Can you just hang tight? Just a little longer?
jimmy,"Alright, man, but Earl said the deal's on the table for twenty-four hours. After that, they're filing the case, and Earl says we're gonna lose."
robert, Alright I hear you. I'll be back with you as soon as I can. Just hang with me a little bit.
reina,You gotta give him up.
jimmy,You said take the money.
reina,"That was to keep quiet, not to go away.  What's he offering you now?"
jimmy,What can he offer me?
robert,He says he didn't take the toll.
robert, Does Standard have clawback?
robert,Let's just say I decide to go in...
robert,"No, just listen, listen to me. If I were to surrender, now, could they roll back the deal?"
robert,"Four years, you think?"
robert," Call the DA, get it started."
robert," Yeah, Glen. Did Mrs. Miller say where she was going tonight...? Aha... No, I'm sure... I'll try her cell."
brent,"Hi I'm Brent Owens, the night supervisor. How can I help you?"
earl," Hello, Brent. I'm Earl Monroe. I'm executing a criminal evidence request. I need to get a look at one of your lane tapes."
brent,I don't understand. This says you want to look at a tape made ten minutes ago...?
robert, Wait. Wait. Just wait.
earl,"Okay, they won't release tapes without a court order, but they did give me a print out, the same kind they used at Jimmy's indictment."
robert," The Lexus- that's your car, your plate?"
rittenband,"Well they look a little different to me, too... Is there a reason you haven't allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to conduct his own analysis?"
deferlito,We've had some issues regarding chain-of-custody...
rittenband,...You don't have them anymore. You're to meet him with the evidence in the next hour.
deferlito,I'm afraid that's not possible.
rittenband,Where's the tape?  Am I not speaking loud enough?
bryer,Your honor...
rittenband,Yes?
deferlito,It seems there's been...
rittenband,...Let him tell me.
bryer,We don't know where it is.
rittenband,Come again?
bryer,It's not in the evidence locker.
rittenband,Where is it?
bryer,We don't know.
rittenband,"I'll ask you one last time, detective. Where is the tape?"
bryer, We lost it.
rittenband,"Hmmm... In light of these developments, and I would think you should be very happy to hear this, with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going to offer Mr. Deferlito the opportunity to voluntarily dismiss the indictment to save us all a bunch of embarrassment."
deferlito,"I don't feel comfortable with that, your honor."
rittenband,"Further I'm going to put all charges against Mr. Grant under seal.  If you have another suspect in the automobile death then you are to present him, but Mr. Grant is free from any further inquiry in this matter. This is over. Do I have your understanding?"
earl,Thank you.
rittenband,"Close the door, detective, please..."
bryer,I'm sorry?
rittenband,"...You finessed it. I know it, and you know it."
bryer,"Oh, okay.  So let me get this straight: What you're telling me is I'm supposed to sit around with my thumb up my ass and my fingers crossed hoping that one of these fucking days, somewhere down the line, one of these rich assholes is gonna say the wrong thing LOUD enough so that we can't choose to ignore it anymore?"
rittenband, Get the fuck outta of my office.
bryer,"Yes, your honor."
bryer," Well when do you expect her...? When do you expect her? Okay, well so I don't have to call a ninth time, will you take down what I'm sayin', word for word...? Okay, you got a pencil? You ready? Okay, here goes: ""Mrs. Miller- Exactly how fuckin' stupid do you really think I am?"""
robert,You didn't hurt anybody. You helped a lot of people.
jimmy,And this piece of paper makes everything okay?
robert,"No, it makes it easier."
jimmy, You worried I'm gonna say something?
robert,No.
jimmy,"Robert, look: you asked me to come meet you and I'm here, but I came because I wanted to get something straight between us: we're even."
robert,"Okay, we're even. But just for the record though, what you did...  Was way beyond the money."
jimmy, Nothing's beyond money for you.
robert, Thanks a lot.
jimmy," And if I take this, then what does that say about me?"
robert,"Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna get there...? I don't wanna get there too soon..."
ellen,You spoke to Brooke?
robert,Did she tell you that?
ellen,No. She didn't have to.
robert,"Yeah, I explained to Brooke that..."
ellen,"...you explained, did you?  Did you tell her everything?"
robert,Yes.
ellen,Everything?  Lift up your shirt.
robert,What?
ellen,Lift up -- your shirt.
robert, Ellen I don't know what you think you know...
ellen,"Oh, don't treat me like an idiot. You've been sneaking off to see her for months. You don't think I know that?"
robert,What do you think you know?
ellen,"I never cared, really, about your secretaries, your- gallerists, whores, whatever you wanna call them. I cared about our home. And now you have brought this to our door."
robert,I did what was necessary.
ellen,"No you did what was necessary for you, Robert, for your interests."
robert,For my interests?
ellen,Yes.
robert,"Everything I do is for us, for this family, and now you're gonna tell me how to run my business."
ellen,"This isn't about your business, this is our life! Where do you think we're going tonight? Why do you think I've even tolerated this for so long?"
robert, What you've tolerated? Wow!
ellen,I'm glad you find that funny.
robert,"What about me? What about the complaints? The unhappiness? The drinking? The shopping? The trainers? Everything! But yes, the charities, the wonderful sainted charities, you know, all the wonderful works that you do. How do you think I've paid for them?"
ellen,I didn't ask you because I didn't want you to lie.
robert, It's cause you didn't want to give `em up!
ellen,But I thought that we had an understanding. And you broke that understanding when you brought Brooke into it.
robert,"No, I kept her out."
ellen,When you made Brooke complicit-- when you risked her future-- and I'm done.
robert,What is this?
ellen,Read it.
robert,"""All ownership and voting rights transfer to the Miller Charitable Foundation, to be administered by Brooke Miller?"" Did you really expect me to sign this thing?"
ellen,You're not following.
robert,"Apparently not, no. No."
ellen," Okay, uhm, the police have been trying to talk me. I assume they want to know where you were that night. And you know what? I'm not gonna lie for you anymore. Not unless you sign that."
robert,"Yeah, this leaves me with nothing."
ellen,I think you'll find a way to manage. I'm sure you have all kinds of things offshore for a rainy day.
robert, This is fuckin' crazy.
ellen," No, if you sign, then I'll tell your lie. I'll say you were at home with me that night, all night, together, here, and you'll be free and clear. And the people who need our money will get it. That's my price."
robert,You're out of your mind. I am not signing that. I will not sign that!
ellen,Well then... I'll have to tell them that you came home at four-thirty bruised and bleeding...
robert, Are you trying to blackmail me?
ellen,I think we call it negotiating.
robert,You're not gonna win that one. There's no fucking way.
ellen,"You know what, it'll cause just enough trouble- the kind of trouble that you don't want-- In fact, according to my lawyer"
robert, Fucking lawyer...
ellen,"It's enough to give them probable cause and then they can subpoena your cell phone, GPS, DNA,"
robert,Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!
ellen,And whatever else they can think of. So really Robert what you have is a choice: you can spend the next three years in court and in the tabloids or-- you can be at your business.
robert, You won't do it. You won't do this. You won't do it to the kids.
ellen,Just try me.
robert,"It's how it all works, Ellen. You know that."
ellen,"I do, but she didn't."
robert,She'll be better for it. The world is cold.
ellen, Then you're gonna need a warm coat.
aimes,"There's just one more thing... And I hate to mention it now, but I just received it..."
