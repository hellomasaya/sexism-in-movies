When I was 15 with my first ever boyfriend after only two weeks he forced me into a sexual encounter. The first time I ever 'took part' in foreplay he held me down and when I protested he said 'just let me'. I knew it was wrong and he manipulated me into thinking I was over reacting. He told me after a month of us being together he felt we should have sex. At 15 I was entirely not ready for this. He made me feel he would leave me if I didn't.
